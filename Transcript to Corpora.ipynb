As you approach the large, extremely imposing palace, you come upon what looks to be an endless series of stairs that brings you to the upper platform that is the central portion of the city where the palace seems to reside, eventually peaking in the Sandherald district that you were referred to earlier as the location of the palace and where the Bowl of Judgment exists. You step up to the very top of the stairs to find yourself already breathless at the sight of the immense purple-blue-colored palace. A dozen towers reach for the clouds, the daylight peeking through their slightly translucent material, like glassy waters ever-frozen in a fall. The central tower, the one that caught your eye, that ends in a large cup-like position, rises above all of them with a slight spiral-type texture to the outside of the palace that is incredibly tall amongst the rest of the cityscape. As you get closer, you can see the main palace structure presents hundreds of arches pointed at their apex in its structure, smaller and smaller as it recesses further into the palace. Its very architectural build is a marvel, and seems to both have consistency and a chaotic feel to the placement of some of these arches too, in size. It\\'s a very strange but fascinating structure. You can also see turquoise detailing and trim against many of the pillars and carvings and statues that adorn the exterior of the grounds of this palace. As you approach what appear to be the front gates that ascend, with a very bright blue turquoise exterior, close to 50 Hands of Ord patrol various elements of the grounds around it. It looks like there are actual pockets of grass and gardens that exist around the Cerulean Palace in here. The topography changes almost to feel like it belongs entirely anywhere but the middle of the desert. The guards do eye you suspiciously as you approach, and you watch as one armored woman, her dark hair hidden mostly beneath an ornate helmet of brass and blue, approaches you guys. \"Welcome to the Cerulean Palace. I must ask \"your business here.\" LAURA:',\n",

As she descends, next to her you see an older woman with these long, ceremonial robes that drag behind her, spilling across the stairs as she descends, seemingly dozens of gemmed bracelets that jingle as she walks with each step. She wears a tall headdress with what looks like brass quills that press behind her head and down her back. As she approaches you all, the woman earlier that you spoke to, the Hand that approached you, stays behind quietly and watches, weapon at the ready. The woman steps forward with a smile, and unlike the abrasive appearance that most of the Hand have given, she seems to be more welcoming, and gives, for the first time since you\\'ve been here, a very formal welcoming bow with her hand before her, the other hand out.

Looks up, and there's a (impact) shuddering sound. Suddenly, the bland, uncharacteristic walls, compared to the rest of the palace, begin to slide past the chains, now making this rattling sound as the floor itself seems to be lurching. You feel a bit of pressure in the room that wasn't there before. You're all being lifted, and the walls, now no longer walled in by the rest of the palace, you can now see this occasional traveling-down line as the spiral on the outside of the tower you once saw now surrounds you.

You all seem to lurch for a moment, yourself, an inch before you catch yourself on your feet. The Maven catches herself, very used to this transition. You now see behind her, where it has stopped, there is another set of doors, similar to the ones you entered from in the bottom portion of this tower. The door opens, (creak) and you can see the next room is a set of staircases of the same color that slowly curl off and disappear upward above you. \"Please, follow me.\" She walks in, her robe dragging behind her. You guys give enough berth for it to follow. As you\\'re led up the stairway, choosing right or left, they both lead to the upper platform in what is the top of the central tower of the Cerulean Palace. As you enter this room, you see close to a hundred dangling silk tapestries from 50 or 60 feet up of multitudes of different colors; rainbowscapes of beautiful translucent cloths and silks, gently flowing with breezes and mingling and mixing into each other around the outside of the wall. High arched windows on each side, and behind, what looks to be a large opening reveals passing clouds surrounding this height and obfuscating certain portions as they meet with the height of this tower\\'s apex. You see a large balcony from the opposite side of the room that is opened from its own similar-sized arch that extends outward. It has a railing about four feet up that is an opening that overlooks in open air all above the city to see. In the center of the chamber, you see a series of step-like platforms, circular, that rise up upon each other, and in the center, you see what seems to be a tall throne of bronze and sapphire that probably sits ten feet up from the base. Thin, but extremely long and widens towards the top. You can see hundreds of sapphires put into and set into this shiny, ruddy metallic material that frames the entirety of the throne. And there sitting atop this throne, you see a slender, human-like entity wearing no jewelry, no ceremonial adornments, no crown, just a simple brown cotton shirt over simple, elegant pants. Bare feet, no shoes. Androgynous and beautiful; you\\'re unable to make out the sex of this creature. It\\'s not a man, nor elf. Not fey, but something somewhat alien, almost. The skin a deep-set reddish brown, smooth and impeccable. The features are extremely fine and delicate. The eyes are what catch you: black like night, but the pupils, burning points of molten metal. The entity smiles and stands off the throne. Now, at this height, seeing it standing almost as tall as Grog, by comparison. The limbs are elongated.

Very emotional episode last week. We're going to kick it into the next step of Vox Machina's adventure this week, and then, me, Marisha, and Taliesin will be gone next week, so there will not be progression in this current storyline.

SAM:\", '', ''), ('MATT: All right, thank you, Sam. SAM:', '', ''), (\"MATT: Perfect. (laughs) All right, other announcements that we have. Let's see. Projects that have come up. They recently announced and put up the English cast video for Final Fantasy XV. I have the pleasure of playing Cor Leonis. It's a lot of fun. As a longtime Final Fantasy fan, being a part of this means a great deal, and I'm excited for the game that comes out in November. So if you haven't checked out the video, do so and you can watch me wax poetic briefly about my love of the series. Look forward to that. MARISHA:\", '', ''), ('MATT: Yeah, man! They chose my soundbite for the end of it. I was like (explosion). Felt cool about that. MARISHA:', '', ''), (\"MATT: It's like I played a bunch of them. Also, Deus Ex came out. Mankind Divided. I am scattered throughout the game with a very harsh Russian, Eastern European dialect, as many characters, probably yelling at you or being shot in the face. So enjoy that, as well. TRAVIS:\", '', ''), (\"MATT: Hey, you know? Everyone's got a skillset. Anybody else have anything they want to announce? SAM:\", '', ''), (\"MATT: That's right! We just got nominated for a Streamy. A Streamy award under gaming. Games. It's awesome! SAM:\", '', ''), ('MATT: It is now decided by whatever the Illuminati Streamy committee is. SAM:', '', ''), (\"MATT: Love you, Mark. We're just excited to be in that ring. Thank you guys for being so awesome and supporting us, and hopefully some of us will get to dress up fancy and show up and go home proud that we went. TALIESIN:\", '', ''), (\"MATT: And Muzzled the Musical, which I co-created, which Ashly Burch stars in, who you'll see next week, that got nominated for best indie.

TRAVIS:\", '', ''), ('MATT: Anyone else have anything they want to talk about before we jump into the game? TALIESIN:', '', ''), (\"MATT: All righty. That being the case, then let's go ahead and hop into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music] MATT:\", '', ''), ('MATT: All right, so. Vox Machina. Taking your time to mourn in your own interesting ways. What is your path of action? What is your course, going forward? LIAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: Okay. So you\\'ve all spent the majority of it in your respective rooms-- most of you in your respective rooms-- figuring out where you are as a person and where this story leads you. After an evening\\'s rest, the next morning comes around, breakfast is already prepared by the servants in the castle, though maybe not the amount of bacon you were hoping, and easily rectified upon request. It\\'s at your disposal. There is a tension in the city; the barrier remains up. As you\\'re having breakfast, you can see Zahra wander in at the smell of bacon, glances over the rest of you, still holding a book at her side that she slams closed. \"Oh. I\\'m glad to see you\\'re all \"right, and you\\'re safe. Please tell me there\\'s more bacon.\" TRAVIS:', '', ''), ('MATT: She comes and sits down and spends breakfast with you guys, catching up on what has transpired and what your current plan of action is.

I\\'m going to continue with my research, since the rest of the ziggurat clan \"are now scattered about or maintaining that barrier. Guess who has to do the research in the \"meantime?\" And she rolls her sleeves up; you can see the slightly smudged dirt across her reddish skin. She\\'s been hard at work digging around trying to figure out what the basis of this enchantment beneath the city still is. LAURA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"I\\'m certain time will allow me at some point. It better. I\\'m going a little stir-crazy.\" She grabs the bacon from the table and walks out of the room.

I\\'ve been underground most of the time.\" TALIESIN:', '', ''), (\"MATT: It's actually a sigil by memory that he has, and it's a spell that he casts. It's not a permanent fixture in the city. TALIESIN:\", '', ''), (\"MATT: It's a renewal feature. He has to spend some time each day maintaining it. He's not stuck there the whole time. SAM:\", '', ''), ('MATT: Roll an intelligence check. MARISHA:', '', ''), (\"MATT: That's what they look like. LAURA:\", '', ''), (\"MATT: They're huge. Most definitely. They're nasty; they burrow. The actual blood within their body is heated to such a degree that even to be in a scuffle with it is to scar yourself with flame and heat. SAM:\", '', ''), (\"MATT: You guys head outside of Castle Whitestone. Not far from the base of the pathway into the actual city, you can see there is a series of newer-outfitted guards. They are people being trained in the force of combat. You can see that there's definitely a ramping-up of the defense force for Whitestone as a precaution. MARISHA:\", '', ''), ('MATT: Many of them look able-bodied and people that are strong and fit, but they do appear to be civilians that have had to take up the cause just in case. MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: No kids, no. They all look to be at least of strapping age, to be carrying a weapon. SAM:', '', ''), (\"MATT: As you are watching the group go through their different weapon practice moments, they're breaking off into small sparring groups and they're going up against ramshackle built training dummies. There are a few that are doing forms in succession. (grunts) You know the deal. You do see on the opposite end that the person who is currently helming one section of the training is Kashaw. You can see a bunch of shield and spear fighters right now, and he's basically giving them instruction on how to use a shield defensively and the spear offensively simultaneously. LAURA:\", '', ''), ('MATT: As you approach, you see him leaning in with younger, early twenties-looking men. A bit scrawny; they\\'re still armored; the helmet looks a little lopsided. Kashaw\\'s like, \"You\\'re not \"supposed to put the shield away. (sighs) Oh, wonderful. Take five. Take 30. So. You\\'re alive. \"That\\'s great. I\\'m excited. What can I do for you?\" TALIESIN:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"Depends on where and what you\\'d have me doing.\" TALIESIN:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"So you\\'re saying that I go back to frozen-ass Vasselheim to deliver a paper message \"to the headmistress, whom already I am so happy to be away from.\" MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: He glances over at the rest of the soldiers. \"Yeah, I\\'ll take it.\" (laughter) LAURA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"I\\'ll do my best to muster some semblance of emphasis.\" TALIESIN:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"All right. Give me a list of what you\\'ve got to offer. I\\'ll bring it to them.\" TALIESIN:', '', ''), ('MATT: Make a check. LIAM:', '', ''), (\"MATT: As you're having this conversation, (whack) right in the knee cap, a surprisingly painful and forceful blow. It's less the strength behind it and more the precision in which it strikes you right between the kneecap and the rest of the lower half of your knee. TRAVIS:\", '', ''), (\"MATT: Yeah, and you're like (grunts) and you glance over and you see Vax hide a wooden sword quickly behind him as he backs away. LIAM:\", '', ''), (\"MATT: Roll a strength check. Actually, this time it's an attack roll, as well. MARISHA:\", '', ''), (\"MATT: You're not proficient with a sword. LIAM:\", '', ''), ('MATT: (laughs) You whack him. This time, it hits the meat of his thigh and has no effect. LIAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: Okay, roll an attack roll. LIAM:', '', ''), (\"MATT: Before this happens, as you're getting up, you watch as Vax rears back, and as he throws it, (yelps) he pulls a muscle in his shoulder and it drops to the ground, and you're like (pained noises). LAURA:\", '', ''), ('MATT: Make a persuasion check. TALIESIN:', '', ''), ('MATT: You watch as roughly 45 armored soldiers all turn towards you with their shields and spears... and freeze. They all slowly look towards Scanlan and whisper among themselves, then look back at Grog and stay frozen and two creep forward for a minute. Get a little closer. TRAVIS:', '', ''), ('MATT: As your form swells into your now enlarged goliath battle-ready form, you notice a few of them start giving off this rattling metal sound as their armored knees (clanging) together. Many of them step back about ten feet, and Kashaw, who hasn\\'t left entirely, spins around and goes: \"The \"gnome\\'s fucking with you. It\\'s fine!\" He walks up to you, Scanlan, pats your arm and goes, \"That was \"pretty funny.\" SAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"Don\\'t get the people killed. I\\'ve been working on them for four days.\" SAM:', '', ''), (\"MATT: Well, we'll see. Go ahead and roll an attack roll. TRAVIS:\", '', ''), ('MATT: Roll a strength check. LIAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: Okay. TRAVIS:', '', ''), ('MATT: Roll again because he used a Luck point to force you to reroll your attack roll. TRAVIS:', '', ''), ('MATT: What was the strength roll again? TRAVIS:', '', ''), ('MATT: Strength check was 24. So as you peek out of the corner of your eye you hear this (heavy steps) and as you try and spin and dodge out of the way instinctually-- LIAM:', '', ''), (\"MATT: I know and we'll get to that. Instinctually, you turn to dodge out of something Grog-sized, not giant-sized. And in that brief minute that you remember that he grew, you pause just long enough to (whack) feel the force of what feels like a giant battering ram slam into your side, sending you off your feet and arcing a good 30 feet before you (impact) tumble and skid to the ground. What's your strength modifier? TRAVIS:\", '', ''), (\"MATT: Seven. You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half because you're taking Uncanny Dodge. So only seven points bludgeoning damage. You stay there for a second, stunned. You feel a bit of bile and iron taste in the back of your throat. LIAM:\", '', ''), ('MATT: (laughing) Make an investigation check. TRAVIS:', '', ''), ('MATT: They appear to have maintained their composure as gauntlets. LIAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: You watch as a lot of the soldiers who had been watching this endeavor step even further away from Grog, and some of them begin walking off, taking their helmets off. \"All right, we\\'re done.\" LAURA:', '', ''), ('MATT: They all nod their heads. \"Yeah, I know that. Thank god!\" But they\\'re all doing this while still locking eyes with him. \"That\\'s great.\" And slowly walk off. TRAVIS:', '', ''), ('MATT: A portable writing desk? TALIESIN:', '', ''), ('MATT: You have access to a quill and ink, you have access to parchment. LIAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: You have access to that, yes. LIAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: All right. Yes, you have access to that. SAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: He has a spell for that. (laughter) TALIESIN:', '', ''), ('MATT: As you finish penning the letter, you read over it once, twice, make sure all the information is contained. You go ahead and grab the little bit of your offering of dragon scales and teeth. Present them to Kashaw. He takes the letter and reads it over. \"Sure.\" SAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"Are you going to do your tree thing for me? Otherwise, I can walk, but it\\'ll be a month and a \"half before I get to shore.\" MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"I\\'m can figure something out.\" LAURA:', '', ''), ('MATT: (chuckles) \"No.\" MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"All right.\" Gets his shield and his spear and walks down with Keyleth towards the Sun Tree. As he\\'s walking down, at your side. LAURA:', '', ''), ('MATT: As he walks with you down the pathway, having this conversation. It\\'s that awkward, quiet about three, four minutes of walking before he goes. (sniffs) \"Ugh. So when all this is over--\" MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"If we survive all this dragon business--\" MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"Do you want to get a drink?\" MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"Good.\" MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"Great.\" MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: You guys begin to approach the edge of the tree.

It doesn\\'t work out for anybody. Trust me.\" MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"All right, then. We\\'ll just-- hey!\" And you push him through the tree. Shuts behind him. You\\'re left there alone, standing in the cold Whitestone air outside of the Sun Tree. Around mid-morning. SAM:', '', ''), (\"MATT: All right. You guys make your way towards the building that has recently been essentially given to and is acting as the abode for Shaun Gilmore while he's here in Whitestone. As you come to the front door, the door's closed. You knock. (knocking) No response. LIAM:\", '', ''), ('MATT: You hear a muffled voice in the distance within the building go, \"Yeah, hold on.\" LAURA:', '', ''), (\"MATT: It sounded like Gilmore. He's under some sort of duress. MARISHA:\", '', ''), ('MATT: Slightly. LAURA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"Yes. Hold on, please.\" And you watch as the barrier flickers for a second and restores itself, almost like a wave of energy brought what was a slowly dwindling bit of the blue energy, now restored to its full strength. TRAVIS:', '', ''), ('MATT: A moment passes before the door opens again and you see Gilmore there, beads of sweat down the front of his face. He\\'s got his fuzzy purple-blue robe wrapped around him. \"My sincerest apologies, \"I had to take care of the now morning ritual.\" LAURA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"I\\'m fine. This is child\\'s play compared to what you\\'re having to deal with on a daily basis, \"I\\'m sure.\" MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: Go for it. MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: 15.

All right. Come in.\" He closes his robe a little bit and walks in, and you enter. You can see there\\'s a half-drunken tea set, and he begins to walk past. \"Tea, anyone?\" SAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"I\\'ll do what I can.\" TALIESIN:', '', ''), ('MATT: Currently, there is one cup, but as he walks by, he does this with his fingers and you watch as multiple cups drift off the shelf and find their way (cups landing) on the table. LAURA:', '', ''), ('MATT: It looks a little disheveled, but also it hasn\\'t been too long since the assassination attempt on him and he threw his attacker into the far wall, but it looks like the furniture has been placed up. There are still some bits and pieces of broken things here and there, but for the most part it doesn\\'t look like he\\'s had lot of time to clean up other than just making it functional. It seems livable; it\\'s not too bad. He goes into the kitchen. He comes back out a moment later with a fresh pot of hot tea and sets it down. \"All right. So this isn\\'t going to send you to where you\\'re going--\" SAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"It\\'s hot. It\\'s dry. Bring some water if you can.\" LIAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"I should not.

You guys exit, find yourself on the exterior walls of Ank'Harel, the sun blazing down in the early morning, a hotter temperature than you've been used to in quite some time. Would be the equivalent of probably the low 100s Fahrenheit by our standards. All of you with layers of armor, which is all of you except for Grog, immediately feel this is going to be uncomfortable fairly quickly. Grog, you are used to higher colder climates, even without being heavily armored, still fairly uncomfortable. TRAVIS:\", '', ''), (\"MATT: It's not great. You can see the caravans that you guys were camping loosely next to are no longer there. It looks like there have been a couple of dark spots in the dust and the sand that have been kicked over where the campsites were, where the fires were put out, and tracks of where the carts and wheels have been dragged to and through the gate.

The same man walks up, now looking a little tired; his day is probably finishing out the rest of his station here at the gate.

Streets of smooth cobblestone-like red pebbles lead your eyes to hundreds of visible, vertically-inclined buildings of reaching peaks and smooth, pointed rooftops as far as your eye can see across the cityscape. It's a city of vibrant color; you see nearly every home, storefront, and outhouse has some form of draping silks or painted mural to give it individual character, standing out against the rest of its neighboring abodes, creating a calming, beautiful symphony of really nothing, in the presentation of it all. The people are walking with purpose, and the sounds of foreign barking and shouts occasionally break the air. Welcome to Ank'Harel. TALIESIN:\", '', ''), ('MATT: What do you guys wish to do?

SAM:', '', ''), (\"MATT: All right. As you guys continue deeper into the city, the sheer size of this town reminds you of a mirror universe form of Emon, in the way that the streets narrow and then open, and the liveliness of culture around you in its heyday, and it saddens you, because it reminds you of back when the city was at its prime, when you first arrived and made it a home for yourself. But at the same time, the energy is infectious, and you can't help but feel like there's a lot of interesting people, culture, and momentum all about you no matter where you seem to walk across these streets. Though the culture here appears to be far older than that of Emon that you've encountered; even the buildings and constructs range in ways that-- maybe not as old as Vasselheim, per se, but at least you can see that there's some variation to some of the abodes here that have been worn through time more so than any you have encountered in Tal'Dorei, for the most part. These decorated and intricate buildings fill the streets. You can see pride in their construction, and the smells of horses and hot desert air combine with various burning spice and sage that occasionally wafts through the air to your nostrils. The ever-changing exotic skyline occasionally grabs your attention. You see the distant shadow of what looks like a skyship docked at a sky port. You get looks of many citizens, expressions ranging from amusement to mistrust as you pass by, until you come upon a massive building that shines with the sunlight. Above you, you see a number of red flags that hang and drift, about five feet in length, these thin, draping pieces of silk that shift with the breeze, and you can see numbers of these strands across different roads, and it's at this point that you look up and realize that this is the entrance to the Suncut Bazaar. Looking off towards the left, and what you've been watching as you approach, there are this cluster of dark blue and purple towers of various widths marking a central place in the center of the city. In the center of them, there is one very large, cylindrical tower that rises up past them all into what looks like a chalice or a cup-like platform at the very top that is impossibly high amongst the rest of the structures here in the city. It seems to be a beacon or watchtower over the entirety of Ank'Harel. But your attention now, here in the Suncut Bazaar, as you step around the corner, you can see tents and storefronts and buildings and voices raised as different barkers are shouting out for their wares. You can see carts being drawn through the streets by horse and camel. You can see what appear to be dozens upon dozens of people coming through with small satchels and coming by and purchasing their necessities for the day. You can smell cooking meats and food in the distance. You can see street performers juggling, and distant music of buskers in the side of the street, playing various flutes and instruments: some you recognize, some you do not. You actually see a shawm. It catches your attention on the side of the street. SAM:\", '', ''), ('MATT: And here you are, amongst the Suncut Bazaar. TRAVIS:', '', ''), ('MATT: Make a perception check. TRAVIS:', '', ''), ('MATT: 14. No matter where you walk, eyes are on you. TRAVIS:', '', ''), (\"MATT: Most people you come around here, it seems a largely human population. Beyond that, you've not seen a single dwarf as you've walked through the city, but you have seen a number of dark-skinned halflings, a few half-elves. Not an elf has caught your eye since you've wandered through. You've seen a couple of tieflings that walk openly in this city, which is a rare thing from Emon. Even there, most tieflings generally are met with mistrust and prejudice in the street. Here, no one seems to pay mind or bother. You do see a few half-orcs, this team of half-orcs that are shouting out in a language that none of you understand. Some sort of sales pitch they're giving, and there's a few people gathered around them. This is a very wide variety of people that live in this city, and everyone seems to mesh together without issue or prejudice, but not one goliath has caught your eye, and you've caught the eyes of many. And wherever you walk, you can see the townspeople stop, and they don't gawk. They don't stare intently. They're more curious, but no one appears to be following you. LAURA:\", '', ''), ('MATT: There are a few that appear to go into buildings, but the majority of this, as you look at now the Suncut Bazaar itself, while it is a section of the city, it is mostly open sky and is probably hundreds of various tents, carts, pop-up stand-ups, and even the center of the street, blankets set out, with the various merchants there with their wares strewn across the ground, waiting for anybody to come and approach.

Would you like for \"these fine apples, of which are the finest you could find?\" MARISHA:', '', ''), ('MATT: \"Ah, well--\" She takes the apples back. \"What you\\'d prefer, then, would be the kurrak \"fruit.\" And she pulls out what looks like a mango, but the exterior of it is very rough, with these little spines all around it. \"While it is difficult to hold, crack open for a delightful \"flavor.

And you see what appears to be an older man with a very long braided beard that goes past his belly-button. He sits there, sleeveless open shirt, baggy pants, no shoes, and before him a deck of cards that is laying in a stack, and he has his eyes closed with his hands resting at the ends of his knees.

As you approach the large, extremely imposing palace, you come upon what looks to be an endless series of stairs that brings you to the upper platform that is the central portion of the city where the palace seems to reside, eventually peaking in the Sandherald district that you were referred to earlier as the location of the palace and where the Bowl of Judgment exists. You step up to the very top of the stairs to find yourself already breathless at the sight of the immense purple-blue-colored palace. A dozen towers reach for the clouds, the daylight peeking through their slightly translucent material, like glassy waters ever-frozen in a fall. The central tower, the one that caught your eye, that ends in a large cup-like position, rises above all of them with a slight spiral-type texture to the outside of the palace that is incredibly tall amongst the rest of the cityscape. As you get closer, you can see the main palace structure presents hundreds of arches pointed at their apex in its structure, smaller and smaller as it recesses further into the palace. Its very architectural build is a marvel, and seems to both have consistency and a chaotic feel to the placement of some of these arches too, in size. It\\'s a very strange but fascinating structure. You can also see turquoise detailing and trim against many of the pillars and carvings and statues that adorn the exterior of the grounds of this palace. As you approach what appear to be the front gates that ascend, with a very bright blue turquoise exterior, close to 50 Hands of Ord patrol various elements of the grounds around it. It looks like there are actual pockets of grass and gardens that exist around the Cerulean Palace in here. The topography changes almost to feel like it belongs entirely anywhere but the middle of the desert. The guards do eye you suspiciously as you approach, and you watch as one armored woman, her dark hair hidden mostly beneath an ornate helmet of brass and blue, approaches you guys. \"Welcome to the Cerulean Palace.

As she descends, next to her you see an older woman with these long, ceremonial robes that drag behind her, spilling across the stairs as she descends, seemingly dozens of gemmed bracelets that jingle as she walks with each step. She wears a tall headdress with what looks like brass quills that press behind her head and down her back. As she approaches you all, the woman earlier that you spoke to, the Hand that approached you, stays behind quietly and watches, weapon at the ready. The woman steps forward with a smile, and unlike the abrasive appearance that most of the Hand have given, she seems to be more welcoming, and gives, for the first time since you\\'ve been here, a very formal welcoming bow with her hand before her, the other hand out.

From the interior, massive pointed archways that lead down ornately decorated halls that echo with each footfall that hits across what looks like endless white and black bespeckled marble. She leads you through a series of hallways, more Hands walking past, as well as a number of other robed individuals. What appears to be a central chamber that has a number of steps and seats, where it looks like various philosophers are in mid-heated discussion in once again, this same language that you have not heard on your ears before.

No other exit. You all enter and the door closes behind you, the Maven still relaxing, her arms to her side, her headdress still giving her this ominous presence. Looks up, and there's a (impact) shuddering sound. Suddenly, the bland, uncharacteristic walls, compared to the rest of the palace, begin to slide past the chains, now making this rattling sound as the floor itself seems to be lurching. You feel a bit of pressure in the room that wasn't there before. You're all being lifted, and the walls, now no longer walled in by the rest of the palace, you can now see this occasional traveling-down line as the spiral on the outside of the tower you once saw now surrounds you. The walls are much thinner than the rest of the palace, as you can see through this somewhat-translucent glass exterior the entirety of Emon surrounding you from upon high as it goes lower and lower as you're lifted higher and higher into this tower.

As you go higher and higher, you can see the countless homes, walls, and towers getting smaller and smaller, other towers eventually ending as you go higher in the tower. The Maven says, \"I request you do not touch the walls, please.\" SAM:', '', ''), ('MATT: The view reveals the entirety of the city around you, and beyond that, the distant dunes and the desert that seems to have no end. You view a far-off mountainscape a little bit in the northern direction that just begins to peek past your view, then (boom) the floor ceases again. You all seem to lurch for a moment, yourself, an inch before you catch yourself on your feet. The Maven catches herself, very used to this transition. You now see behind her, where it has stopped, there is another set of doors, similar to the ones you entered from in the bottom portion of this tower. The door opens, (creak) and you can see the next room is a set of staircases of the same color that slowly curl off and disappear upward above you. \"Please, follow me.\" She walks in, her robe dragging behind her. You guys give enough berth for it to follow. As you\\'re led up the stairway, choosing right or left, they both lead to the upper platform in what is the top of the central tower of the Cerulean Palace. As you enter this room, you see close to a hundred dangling silk tapestries from 50 or 60 feet up of multitudes of different colors; rainbowscapes of beautiful translucent cloths and silks, gently flowing with breezes and mingling and mixing into each other around the outside of the wall. High arched windows on each side, and behind, what looks to be a large opening reveals passing clouds surrounding this height and obfuscating certain portions as they meet with the height of this tower\\'s apex. You see a large balcony from the opposite side of the room that is opened from its own similar-sized arch that extends outward. It has a railing about four feet up that is an opening that overlooks in open air all above the city to see. In the center of the chamber, you see a series of step-like platforms, circular, that rise up upon each other, and in the center, you see what seems to be a tall throne of bronze and sapphire that probably sits ten feet up from the base. Thin, but extremely long and widens towards the top. You can see hundreds of sapphires put into and set into this shiny, ruddy metallic material that frames the entirety of the throne. And there sitting atop this throne, you see a slender, human-like entity wearing no jewelry, no ceremonial adornments, no crown, just a simple brown cotton shirt over simple, elegant pants. Bare feet, no shoes. Androgynous and beautiful; you\\'re unable to make out the sex of this creature. It\\'s not a man, nor elf. Not fey, but something somewhat alien, almost. The skin a deep-set reddish brown, smooth and impeccable. The features are extremely fine and delicate. The eyes are what catch you: black like night, but the pupils, burning points of molten metal. The entity smiles and stands off the throne. Now, at this height, seeing it standing almost as tall as Grog, by comparison. The limbs are elongated. Extends a hand towards you as you step into the chamber. \"Welcome to Ank\\'Harel, heroes of Tal\\'Dorei.
