# Critical Role

Dungeons and Dragons has always been seen as one of the geekiest hobby anyone could have. It's a game where people create characters and act them out in fantasy settings. A game whose rules and mechanics are longer than most novels. 

But if I didn't have anything interesting to say about it, I wouldn't bother with this post. Well, today I'm going to tell you about the group that helped make Dungeons and Dragons cool - Critical Role.


# What is Critical Role?

Critical Role is, in their own words, a show "where a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons." 

It started off as a casual house game with friends before someone had the bright idea to start streaming on Twitch. And before you ask yourself, "Who would spend time to watch grown adults play Dungeons and Dragons?"

# Meet the Players
Dungeons and Dragons is, at its core, a social game. When you play, you're plopped into a fantasy world governed by a Dungeon Master. You and a group of friends, all playing their own fantasy personas, get to interact with this world. You make your own choices and suffer your own consequences.

So like any Dungeons and Dragons game, the success of Critical Role is largely driven by the creative minds of its Dungeon Master and its players. When they're not busy with Critical Role, each and every one of them have accolades in the voice acting industry. You've probably heard some of their work in the games you've played and media you've consumed.

Let's meet the personalities that make up the game.

# Transcripts 
This humble study would not have been possible without the hard work from Critical Role Transcripts. These transcripts record what each of them said in each episode.

Textual analysis is a powerful thing. 

A basic example is just counting how many words were said in each episode.
