Like so many Half-Elves,  Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering  the cool reception of a people who donâ€™t fully accept her. Born of a Human mother, and an elven father who only later in life  took an interest in their existence,  Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on  in this world were each other. It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother,  and brought to live in Singorn,  the isolated Elven city for which their father was an ambassador.  He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance,  and after too many years of disdainful looks,  the pair decided to leave his indifference behind,  and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and  learning the ways of the thief,  while Vex kept to the woods.  She preferred the isolation.  Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,  to spy and to shoot.  And through a series of fateful events,  earned herself a companion in the form of a bear -  her own stolen Trinket -  to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.  Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages.
