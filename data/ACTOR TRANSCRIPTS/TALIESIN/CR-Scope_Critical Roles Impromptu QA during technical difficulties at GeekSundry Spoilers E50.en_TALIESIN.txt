Hi. I can't say what I'm working on, can I? I'm doing things. I'm working super secret projects I can't talk about. Oh yeah. Yes. I can. Will I? No. But yeah. If I'm just for fun? Actually just because I was a nerd, this kind of nerd as a kid-- The Illuminatus Trilogy was a lot of fun when I was a teenager. By Robert Anton Wilson. (raspberry) Right now, stuff I'm really enjoying is-- The Wicked and Divine is fucking amazing. What else was I reading today? Miss Marvel is a lot of fun if you're into the Marvel stuff. For a DC book I'm really enjoying American Alien, Superman and American Alien. Yes. Max Landis's weirdly good take on Superman. It makes you like Superman. Yeah. You're a liar. You're a dirty liar! No. No, no no no no. Oh god. They're biased. (laughs) I'm trying. Well you do roll a lot of natural 20s also when things are going-- I was amazed to find that your real name wasn't Liam. That got dark! (laugh) Little-- Never mind. Walking on, walking on. Yeah no. I'm actually very excited that I'm-- I feel better about it. I felt weird about it. You do roll-- well it's the battle rolls, because like-- I roll a twenty three times an attack. So it-- Against your magic. And that's where your numbers come from. Yeah. That's where your numbers come from. You get all the passive rolls. I do. It feels good. I need the dopamine, man. The reason I have the Super Mario coin as my text message is because every time I get a text message it's like, Ah! It can't be that bad. You know what? We don't' have to figure that out, because CritRoleStats will do that for us. I know. MARISHA and Really don't do that. [inaudible]
