And they're gone. That's true. Except one. That will do. Pretty good for Pike. LAURA and 25. Fast, fast. And extra hit points. Okay. It's coming. Is there room, can I get even vaguely a shot in that room? I'll move a little bit. I have Spider Climb on right now, so actually I'll climb up on the wall and then climb back down when I'm done. I'm going to-- Ignore that, I've been drinking. First of all, I'm going to cast Hex on him. Because that's really going to make a difference. What kind of checks should I-- I'm going to down him for-- I'm going to give him a disadvantage on dexterity checks. Because fuck it. All right, I'm going to take out Bad News, and I'm going to take two shots, which is my way, with Hex and Bad News, and hopefully everything's going to go just fine. I'm going to use Sharpshooter, and I'm going to use Deadeye on the first one. I'm going to drop a point on Deadeye. So, Deadeye roll-- That should have counted, damn it, I shouldn't have picked it up. Oh, thank god. That's-- sorry, I'm blanking. 26 to hit. Yeah, let's not start saying that now. And that's-- wow, I'm nervous! That's actually really good. First shot is 21, 37 points of damage plus five points of necrotic damage. That's really nice. I rolled really high, and I have Sharpshooter running. Next one, I'm going to shoot Sharpshooter, but no Deadshot. Is an 18 to hit? Okay, second one misses. I'm going to crawl back and hide again and get a little bit of-- yeah, I got up on top, took two shots, and crawled back down to hide. I'm regretting so many things right now! Not you! Oh god! I shouldn't avoid my family. It leads to dragons. I would get back behind the wall if I were you. The wall will at least take some damage at this point, most things he's going to do are going to be a giant area effect anyway that you're not going to be able to outrun, you might as well have cover-- That will be our next t-shirt, "Yay, 8th-level spell." But he is picked up for 50 feet, though. I would say also just because Pike was going to do a thing, so come back for Pike's thing that she was going to do. Does partial cover help at all? I'm rerolling that. That's a little better. I just had to use a Resolve. A one. So I had to burn a Resolve, which I have done. It'll help. Does the five get subtracted before we halve it, or after? 24 is a "just made it?" 18. They're technically not temporary, it's actually your max increases, so they can come back. You can heal into them. You're 17 up. You can go 17 up even if you lose them. Your max is now much higher. Ten. Good! That's really good. Go nuts with it, yeah. So, if it's 3d4, you just get 12. That's amazing! You can do it at any level you like. One of the two of us, I would say. Oh, I'll take it. How much do I get back? 13. All right. d12 is awesome. We're just going to spray-paint Matt's hand purple and he's going to sit there, punch things. Lair actions are the worst. Oh, good. Fine. My dragon gun? I'm going to take a deep breath and shoot directly north, or I suppose to you it would be south, down the map towards that building on the far corner. I'm just going to run in that direction. That's as far as I can get with my full movement? And he has to recharge his fire probably before he can do that again? Okay, that's fine. I'm going to take two shots while I'm running. I'm going to, just because I'm not feeling lucky right now, I'm going to burn another Deadeye on my first run, so let's do that. No, no, I am really not. So less so that I'm not even going to do sharpshooter. That's awesome! I take that back. It's okay. Actually, that doesn't affect the crit at all. Sharpshooter isn't affected by a crit. I critted, by the way. Sorry. That's nice. So, hey! I get that Deadeye back. That's cool. This is like bad college theater. No one knows when to applaud. Excellent. That's-- oh my god, that's kind of nice. 1d12, 2d12, 3d12, 4d12. Pretty good. That's not great, but it'll do. 24 points of damage. And I'm going to take another shot. You know what? Screw it. Let's put a sharpshooter on this. Actually, no. Never mind. Yes! I'm going to put a sharpshooter on this. I am so nervous. I'm putting a sharpshooter on it. Which is good because I rolled-- 17, 18, 19, 26. Yay. And that's 2d12. Yay. Boo, but that's okay. 30 points of damage. (high-pitched noises) Okay. Of course you did. Yeah and now he's got four. Thordak, he's got like 12. Don't make him look things up, it's always going to be worse. Is there a little hole in the ground where the magma came out or no? Gets max healing, because he was in the spell. You beat the Scottish into him. Good to know. We're learning. 22 misses. Who is not immune to fear? There's a lot of alcohol on the set right now. A lot of it's hiding. There's a mini fridge built into Trinket. 12. Fucking Teddy Ruxpin. Yeah, way too many emotions happening there. No, he's not. That's so clutch. We should do that every time from now on. Every die. Vax, it might be worth taking a peek in that crater when you get a second. If we die today, he's going to get the flu later in his life. He has disadvantage. I pray for a single-digit number. Man, you are a tank. We're working on it. No, no. But what happens if you do it at a higher level? Well, I mean, like, next round though, if she does that at a 5th-level, just the damage it'll add will be more than double the damage it'll do now. Which is like another attack you absorb. That's great. It's like one more attack to absorb. That's seven. So you want one more, though. Yeah, okay, that's fine. I am in trouble. I have a whole bunch of your d8s over here, by the way. Feel free to pull them out whenever you like. I'm going to try a couple things. I'm going to do a piercing shot on the fire elemental, which I think I can do. I'm going to start moving in a northerly direction, so I guess I'll take like one or two steps southwest, I suppose it would be to you. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, that'll do it. And I'm going to do a piercing shot. That burns a grit, okay. That'll do! That's 25 to hit the elemental. And now I have to roll again for Thordak? Really? Kima's not short enough that it'll go right over her head? Okay, that's happening, apparently. It's either Kima or Grog. Although Grog takes half damage. You take half damage. It's in the rules. 20. And, no. I can't have a misfire once I've already hit the first? Okay. That's 15, that doesn't hit. I only hit Grog. No, I also hit the fire elemental. Yeah, I hit the fire elemental, though. Maybe I will. Maybe it's Maybelline. Where are my d12s, they seem to have all vanished. That's awful. 13 points of damage. Sorry! And the bullet gets lodged in you. Sorry! And then, is the fire elemental still standing? I'm irritated. I'm burning another grit, and I'm going to do a pushback on the elemental. That's actually no save, that's just a pushback. I just have to hit. And that hits, I should have done a-- that's a 29, 32 to hit. No, I'm saving you. 14. I want you to be able to get up without that thing on you. 20 points of damage. And it gets pushed back ten feet. Thank you. I'm going to use my bonus action for a healing surge to add 22 points to my hit points. Then I'm going to keep running, use spider to run over that wall into that little house beneath the green dragon. There we go. You're having way too much fun. Oh! No, Grog's down, so there's no attack of opportunity. Yeah, you got to see if you can get up and walk away. I am just-- I am regretting so many things right now. Neither do I. I should have saved him-- (half-hearted Wilhelm scream) He's not going to take a shot at the elemental while he's running away? Once I hear a number, I'll be excited. I'm not saying anything until I hear a number. It's going to be, like, 11 points of damage. Now we're on board. No! Are you using the sword? Yes, you are. Love it. That's cool. I had an environmental attack? That does not hit. That hits. Yeah, not mine. Yeah, oh. Does stop, drop and roll work in-- Could be both now, actually. (laughter) She can take a death, remember. She can actually take a death. But yeah. It's so great that you did that 11 points. I'm going to spider-climb-- I'm going to stay within striking distance, I'm not going to disengage from the jerk, but I'm going to climb up on the wall above him, if that's okay. Like, oh, I'm shooting at the television. Here. Yeah, like climb up there and be sideways. I'm going to pull out Bad News, I'm going to try something new. I'm seeing that big spike, there's a big metal spike stuck in his chest right now? Is there still not a metal pole? I thought he got hit by a thing. Okay, I thought he also got hit by a thing. But that's okay. I'm going to try something weird. I'm going to spend a grit for advantage on this shot, because-- I'm going to add two points of Cabal's Ruin to this. I'm going to spend two points of Cabal's Ruin. I have a thing. Oh, I can wait until after? Well, that's even better. So first shot is a 27 to hit. So I'm going to drop two-- I've got the little thing running through my glove, I've got the wire. I'm just going to let go of the little grounding wire and see what happens. I'll hold onto the barrel and pray. Let's add 2d6 to that. Is that right? Yeah. I know, I'm digging this-- augh, it's okay. Yeah, this is okay. 22 points of damage plus two points of electrical damage. I did, yeah, I did, I'm going to do that again. I'm going to burn two more points-- Well, I'm going to wait. That's really cool, that I can wait. I hate it when that happens. I know, that was the worst roll I've ever done. That's okay. It's 22. Just hits? 22 misses?! That's fine. I'm not going to burn any Cabal. So that's fine. That was very cool, though. Once I set it up, I can arc a charge to the bullet. That ends my turn. I may drop back behind-- No, I'm good, I'm good. That was a terrible roll. Terrible roll. Snake eyes was not cool. Walls hate NPCs. Halved? Somebody's going to dive into that hole. I was going to say, if I'm caught in the corner of this, will this extinguish me? Can I autofail if I just want to be-- Oh, that's right, for half damage. All right. Dex saving throw. That's an 11. I just fall on the ground, I assume. No! You could go in the hole, just saying. I care about the hole. With advantage. Cut in half. In combat range of a dragon. Poison immunity. Oh, that just hits. That also just hits. So that's 28 times two. 56. All right, that's fine. I blame you for all of this. I'll be hearing about it from the kitchen. It'll be great. I'll be working on my new character. Which you then double, don't you? Like slap the charred skin off his face. Get back in there! And whatever's in that pit. And whatever's in that pit. Here's 4d8. 5d8. 6d8. Okay. I'm going to, for my bonus action, I'm going to down a greater, which is 4d4, I believe? I'm dying less. I'm going to stand up. I'm technically engaged with this bloody thing, aren't I? Okay. I'm just going to-- There's little I can do other than just say, please, somebody fix this, and I'm going to take two shots at the red dragon. First shot with Bad News. 23? I'm going to just throw-- forget it, I'll throw four charges of Cabal's Ruin there. Let's just do it. Technically speaking, no, the way that this works-- it's like a Tesla arc, so it wouldn't technically-- you'll feel tingly. Bloody fanart. Okay. And let's see what kind of damage we do with this. Eh. That sucks. Stop it! Stop it! I can't count when-- that's (counting) 21 points of damage. Stop saying that, it's 21! You don't know, it's 21. Second shot. Can I reroll that, 'cause he? Yeah, it misses. And now I'm going to die. You're like everything I hate about Overwatch. Yeah. That's my turn. Nope, rerolling that. I'm rerolling, because that was awful. Oh, never mind. Nine. For another round or two. They don't know. Want some d10s? Here's three more. How many are you at? Whoa! Holy fuck. Oh, thank you. Hi. That was really good. Ow. I'm so distracted right now. There's too much happening. That with your bonus? I just said that randomly, I don't actually know any of your bonuses, I just thought maybe it would jog something. Vax is good. This is good. She would know. He's way down in there. That's a long flight. I think I see half a dozen people on their phones behind us. 23. This doesn't feel good on the other end, does it? Oh, 4d4 plus six! I'm going to put Bad News away, pull out Animus and take three shots at this asshole. I'm getting up. Pulling out the gun, putting three sharpshooter shots in this guy. That's a 26. That hits. I'm going to roll that one until he drops, so that I can-- 1d8 plus 1d6. 1d10 plus 1d6. That's 18, 19, 20, 21. 21 points of damage plus four points of psychic damage, so 25 points of damage. Second shot. That's 21 to hit. That's... Not right now, you bastard! I hate you! That's 27 plus... 27 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage to me because I can't think! So 27 points of damage plus one... I'm so sorry. I am now going to start making my way to the-- I'm going to start running my way to the pit. With what little movement I have because I got up. I'll respond. To the pit! Now! She was already going that way, she doesn't get into shit with that. She's not going to get-- She's going in the tunnel. Every six seconds, we get to move. Booking with my spider walk. Running down the ceiling upside-down. We're going to need light down here. What do you see down there? What's happening, what's in the room? What's in the room? I'm at a full run on the roof. Oh boy. I'm not there. I'm doing the best I can, I can't see a damn thing. If she makes her way out, that means we're all dead. Come on in. It'll be fun. Let's all die together. You're going to get the conclusion of this before the next season of Westworld. I've got nothin'. Yeah.
