No, I'm getting into that. Where? I don't know which camera is-- I know. (laughs) Our plan's going to go so well. I would break everything on the way back here. Happy pineapple day. I'm back. What are you going to do? I am sleeping in the corner, I would assume. Roll for it! Matt! Dad, make her roll for it! It's in my possession. All right. That'll do. That's disadvantage. Oh, and minus two. That's 14. Okay. (caws) Have I had a full night's sleep, at this point? Goddamn it. How about making a quiet cavern, not too far away from the summoning circle, where we can hide? That's fair. Vex and I at a distance. Let's go scout out the location. Can you go back and forth? That's a question. I don't want to be food. I want to be something that eats. Can we go in and out of mist form? That's a thing we can do? We're going to do this, as well. If we scout and it's clear, and then we come back and then go back, it might not be clear again. If we scout and it's clear, then we do it. It's done. I'm trying to move in a very windy way, yeah. I am the fart. Hugging the walls, looking normal. I volunteer as tribute! Let Laura lead. Too late. No take-backs. Just stealth for us. 16. Oh yes. We have cover from either side of the top. That's right. I'm going to fly over to the top of the far right of the ravine. Above them, all the way up here. And I'm going to take a look around and see if anybody, anything's around, anything living that looks suspicious. You'd think I'd be able to do this. 18. Nine. Yeah, I'm going to survey. Would I think it's safer above the ravine or within? Actually, that works out perfectly for me. Then I'll jump down to behind that rock and I will de-mist behind that rock. I think a cave entrance right here to somewhere where you can hide after you do the summoning and dive in and get about 25 to 30 feet away. I'm not responsible for what you ate for breakfast. Yes, that's actually-- well. Kima. That's all right. Somebody can mist back and bring her. I think she's already so delighted with you. That might be a terrible idea. That's a very good idea, actually. We do. We want to have places to hide. We want to have a place to hide, and place to shoot from that has cover. Digging a hole and moving the mansion here. It also means that if something goes horribly wrong, you can run downstairs and hide. How strong are the ravine walls, and can we dig into them, as well? Not just the ground, but the walls themselves. Small tunnels, just big enough for one person. Yeah, for tomorrow. And where's the green dragon. It was a good thought. All right. I like the idea of someone going back to get Kima. I think one tunnel on this side, one tunnel on the other side, and one tunnel on the top of the ravine on either side, if you can do that. Not a ton of noise. How loud will this be, do you think? That'll work. No, just goes poof. Little bit of a poof. You can't poof within the mansion. I'm going to spend some time in this form just studying to see if there's anything odd about this circle at all. Studying the stones. Wait. I think we should. I think two crow's nests for the shooters. I draw out, really quickly in the snow-- I'm making ice plates. Not stone? Can you manipulate ice? Can you manipulate ice? But you can't create ice. I think that we could-- Stone Shape? If we pull some of the ice, I can try and make sheets of ice-- We can alter the topography just a bit by taking out some of the ice and then opening it up to make hiding places. That'll do. We don't need a ton of space, because we're never going to move more than six. Give us cover. It would be hard to fall if he attacks us. The best thing, actually, if he attacks us up there would be to jump. You have a broom. I have a rope. Make some pod bubbles. I'm going to start pouring water on this stuff, and it's going to be ice again so quickly. I've already started working on camouflage-- I would take it to the far edge. Even further. I'd say about 50 feet up. I'm creating a breakable ice shield for when it's time, but I'm just giving the nice cover. I know. Ooh! Check out the big brain! I'm just going to spend all my time also trying to keep hiding it, keep reinforcing it. Once the mansion's available, I'm going to take water and slowly add layers. Which is not the direction where Raishan is. Oh shit. We're setting up camp. The attack begins tomorrow morning. There's going to be a beast. There will be a fight. We'll see how it goes. We're going to try and tire him out. Once he's tired out-- It's not like a vampire. There's also going to be a field of-- We did? That's why it's going to be a great plan. Let's make the mansion right now. Please make the mansion. Not if we're in the mansion. Which would be you and I before the fight. It's a plan. It's a plan! Anything more complicated would immediately fall apart when anything shifts, which will inevitably happen. No. Mansion. We will see you in the morning. Thank you. Truly. Excellent. That's why you're here. That's why he's not in here. We wake up early. Before the sun rises, those of us who have to hide, hide. Once we see them bringing him to the summoning circle, we call the beast and we wait. We are going to be in the most danger, because we're going to be right in the thick of it. We're both going to be hiding in an ice-covered cubby-hole. It's not possible to get to those cubby-holes without a difficult climb, is it? I think it's hilarious that we can think we can. We know that the one place she isn't is in here. Wow! Oh my god, we're going to die. Worth it, man. 17. My theory on that subject is that she's clever enough that eyes on her would not be helpful in the first place. It's best to assume that even if we could see her that she would be tricking us over what she's doing. Hide in the mansion and worst-case scenario, scream that she betrayed us and that she promised that she would help kill the white dragon and see if they'll fight it out. Yes. And definitely inspire some conflict. LAURA and I'm at negative one. Not to damage, though. Vex is going to put me in that pocket. We have Dust of Tracelessness. We're going to fly over there, as well. And then also we're attaching a rope, just in case. To the wall, so I have something to climb down with if I need to. It's not going to be hanging out; it's all in. Six. Are there actually enough albino Ravenites that we would stick out, or is that a common color? Oh, then I would recommend not. I would recommend white clothing. All right. Snowy. When you see the dragon pop up into the sky and head this direction, start summoning. Yes, please. That's 16. I would not object to invisibility. Then no. Oh, we made the gumbo. No, he's got a movement and an action. No! (yelling) He has not realized this is possibly a poor idea. Yes? I'm going to signal them to come out. He's expending power, as well. That's the other thing. It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook! Have you said anything in the earpiece yet? I'm holding. Oh! 13. 13, because I'm at a negative one. I was holding ready. Can I try and beat his initiative and get a shot off first? Jenga! I'm going to press a torso push with this, by the way. Yeah, I'm going to press a torso push. Better! 33. I don't even know why I bother. He's automatically pushed ten feet away from me. Oh, that hits. That's magic. So 23 plus six. That's fine. The lightning damage, the cloak doesn't absorb that? Okay. Then I'm going to do my damage on him, which is new to me. That's terrible. That's 11 points of damage, plus two points of psychic damage. 50 feet. Do I join the initiative order? 21. It sees me? All right. Jenga! Except that he also has a dragon to contend with, so as long as we keep it a bigger threat than us, I think he'll keep his concentration where it is. Oh boy. Okay. I'm going to take a wing shot at that dragon to try and drop him. Come on. Natural 20. Does the 1d6 also double? Is it all dice or just the standard damage? Oh, you say that now. Let's see how this goes. First the damage, which is not bad. 16 points of normal damage and 11 points of psychic damage, and he's prone. 16 and 11. That's 27. No, not against the wing shot. Oh, strength saving throw; you're right. Against a DC of 19. Again. That'll hit. 31 to hit. Same thing. 15 points of damage plus one psychic, so 16. 19. So it's dropping now? What should I make it have difficulty with? Not saving, but checks. You never know. One more shot. First, I'm going to Hex the dragon. I'm going to give him disadvantage against strength checks. And I'm going to shoot him with a sharpshooter shot for my last shot. Come on. Yeah! 29. This is good. (excited yell) 18. Oh my god, okay. 28 plus five psychic, so that's 33 points of damage, plus another d6. Plus another five necro. Now, I'm going to take cover in my little cove. Plus five necro, motherfucker. He's checking the sheet. Oh no. It means there's a very angry dragon now that's looking at me. All right. We've got a game. He's just noticing everybody. Can he do that already, even recovering from the prone? Stay down! Is it gargantuan? Gargantuan. Trust Travis on this one. Death from above. MARISHA and Want a bonus? I'm going to take aim and hold my full attack until he tries to get up. That's a sick tattoo, y'all. Oh no. He's even starting to move? I'm laying into him. Spending a grit point and I'm knocking him in the foot, back prone before he can even stand up. This is my third or fourth because I did crit, so I got one back. 22. That's a d10 and a d6, and another d6. 12 points of damage, plus one necrotic and two psychic, so 15 points of damage, and he has a save against 19. No, I was about to say, it's a save, not a check. Unaffected? Again! Blowing it. It's worth it. Gun jams. You know what happens. Ow. That's the end of my turn. I'm going to dive down and hide and hold. Is it constitution saving? Plus two. He moved really far in one turn. Even halved? We're still going to need you, then, apparently. No, what are you going to do? Ancient white dragon. Someone's going to get knocked unconscious. Good, you've burned it. Had to burn it. I am going to heal, as my bonus action. That's not bad. That's 19 points. I'm a little better now. I'm at 108; I'm fine. Now, I'm going to take out Bad News. Fuck Animus for now. Take out Bad News and take two shots at this bastard with sharpshooter. For fuck's sake! Yeah, gun jammed. No, I have one more gun. But I don't have time. That burns an action. Okay, I'm using my action surge. Might as well. No, I'm taking out my last pistol and I'm shooting. I'm just going to shoot. See if I can take two more shots. Technically not; it's two shots. No, I'm not trying to repair. Oh, I'm taking two more shots, then. Sharpshooter shot with Retort. No, it's different. 16. Ah! That one hits, on the other hand, I think. 22? That's not much, but I'll take it. Nine points of normal damage plus two necrotic, so that's 11 points of damage. No, 21 points of damage. I'm so sorry. I'm going to burn my action surge and take three more shots. Fuck it. See if I can lose the third gun. It's that night, apparently. No, I will not. That's 18? Fuck the sharpshooter shot. I'm just going for it. No sharpshooter. Thank god! That's 20? Excellent. Good to know. Oh my god, that's bullshit. Ten points, three necrotic, so it's ten points of damage. My final shot. No, it didn't. This one doesn't do that. That's nice, but I miss. That's 16. That misses. Thankfully, it doesn't burn that gun. No, that gun is better built. I'm rolling really poorly. Yenk ain't got nothing but us to hit right now. Let's not dwell on that. Remember to go into the stomach, if it goes. We've got a relic in its stomach. No! Nixing it! This is my safe place. It would have been 19. This is where being at the end of everything is great. Actually, does that hit both of them? Okay. I'm going to take my three shots. Oh yeah, so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use my bonus action to reload. I'm going to take my three shots at the white dragon with what I have left. I can do nothing. That's 30. One necrotic. 12 points, with one necrotic. Shot number one. Next shot, same thing. Standard shot. That ran, but 22? Oh, sorry. It's not 22. I'm so tired. 17. That misses. 24 for the next shot. That's 12 points, with two points of necrotic. And I'm going to grab my rope, and I'm going to wave at the green dragon and start dropping down. I have a rope. Yeah! I can do that, even at negative one, I can do that. No, I can't. That was a one. Fine! He might have burned it. I've been hit by a goat in the face before. No, really. I got nailed by a goat. No, we were filming this ridiculous television series called Hell Town when I was a kid. It was awful. Not in the show, either. Yeah, we're going to let one leave. One's going to walk. Constitution saving? That would be a negative one? No, not a negative one. Add negative one. That would be 15. There's no middle ground, is there? There's no middle ground at all. How fast? Is he still within visual range? Hit him with everything we've got. There will be a conversation. I run to the body of the big demonic thing and start going through it. Not funny! Vex, we have a dragon to disassemble. I got a 16. No, 16 to investigate. I pull out my sword and cut it out. I walk to you. We're walking to the dragon, anyway. I hand it to you. Your majesty. Karma's a bitch! We're finishing up the harvesting, and I go to talk to Raishan really quickly. I'm sending you to work on the dragon. Okay. Thank you. You've earned a conversation. We'll see you at home. You should get there quickly so there's no suspicion. We don't say it. That was not a fight we were about to have. I'm going to run over and try and pull anything from Yenk. It really was. It actually was. How was this terrible? Good work, girl.
