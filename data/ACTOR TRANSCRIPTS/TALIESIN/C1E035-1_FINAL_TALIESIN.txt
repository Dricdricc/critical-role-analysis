We have a new comic! Who won that drinking contest in real life? I was trying to remember. Who lost that drinking contest, if I recall? Because it's Christmas. I'm really lost right now. I'm genuinely lost. And now that cameo's being edited out. Speaking of which, you're in a thing this week. You look like you're snugly in there, I must say. That was only you. The spirit of Critmas. We get that for free. Yeah. I think I have Cassandra. It's like we're 12. Not until we're past the gold room. The glass room. All the traps are marked. But that already got set off. Is Cassandra awake or is she unconscious? Damn it. We can try a-- I can try. I can't do that. There's nothing he can do with it, anyway. I have all the ammunition. I really don't think they are. No. Thank you? Are you checking on Lady Briarwood? Keep her unconscious. I'm going to try and wake Cassandra up. I'm a little shaky, as well. I want to quickly check my gun. Is Lord Briarwood's name still on it? Let's hold off just a bit before we kill her. Double-check. Perhaps gag her, as well. We don't want her speaking, and she only has one arm, so magic's going to be tricky. She can't see us. Why are we holding our hands up? Actually, you can see us on the screen. Never mind. I can tell. I'm going to try and wake up Cassandra. We will have a discussion later. In the meantime, do you know what that thing in there is and how do we stop it? I'm going to slap her in the face. Not with my strength! 16. Well, actually my strength is still thin because I still have a-- So, 15. I need my sister back. Are you awake? Are you a terrible person? Do I want to strangle you right now? Good. Then we can work with this. They were building something down here. The Briarwoods are no longer a problem. They were building something-- what do you know about it? It maybe started, it seems to be affecting magic. I think. None of us have rolled this well in so long. (starts singing In the Hall of the Mountain King) I walk up to Lady Briarwood. I put my gun to Lady Briarwood's head. You changed the deal. Take her name off the gun. I pull the gun away. Things have changed. We need to talk. (sighs) Did I even want revenge before I talked to you? Did I? I don't remember anymore. What does she die for? What do I even need? I want my country. I want my sister! I've killed two of those who have wronged me and nothing is better. Nothing feels better, nothing is avenged. What is this worth to you? And I put the gun back at her head. Pull it back, put it to her, put it back. "Maybe I will." And back to hers. I put the gun to the side-- no, I'm holding the gun on Briarwood. That deal was a soft deal. It was a dream. It was a vision. I need more from you if you want anything from me. I don't trust you anymore. Besides. I put the gun to the hand of Lady Briarwood and pull the trigger. The gun's broken anyway. I drop it. I'm not satisfied. I want my money back. It's actually also still around her, it occurs to me. Yep. I have advantage! Thank you! Yay! 20. Which does work. Delilah. You are going to die tonight. Whether or not it is a merciful, quick death or a slow and agonizing one, controlled by something darker than I know, is entirely up to you. How do we stop that thing?! I know the pain you're feeling right now. I know the rage. I know every moment of it, and I guarantee I can make it worse. I can make it so much worse. Fix this. And join your beloved. Delilah, don't make me hurt you. Grog, be ready to restrain me. I really haven't. You still have your sanity and your life. I will take your life tonight, but I can leave you your sanity. Okay, I'm going to be an asshole. Fine. Fine. Casting Minor Illusion. I'm changing my form into the screaming, writhing, slowly-melting visage of Lord Briarwood. And I'm just going to scream in holy high hell and pain. Suck it, girl! I'm in smoke. I'm just taking-- That pain you're feeling, I've felt for years. Don't think I've imagined every way to hurt you! I could spend years hurting you before you die, in ways you cannot imagine. Now, how do we stop it? Why? Why was it too soon? What were you waiting for? No, I really won't. Knock her out again. Collect them. Check her person for anything. I think we're just going to throw her into the acid pits. No, I don't feel... They're different bullets. The three, in theory, is actually low enough to break it further. Fine. Nope. That's a 16. Scanlan. Give me the other gun. The other gun. I need another gun. Maybe? I don't know. Things have gotten a bit weird. Did they not hear any of the voice? Oh shit, I came off like a crazy person just then! Things are complex, and I don't trust myself to take her life. I'm in over my head. I don't know if that will help. This thing wants her dead, and the only thing I can think to do is to say no. This thing in my head-- I don't know! I had a dream, and that was all. It was a dream where I was offered a means to revenge. It was a dream! Well, I know that now. This is as new to me as anyone. Please. Why do you all keep rolling so poorly against me? Persuasion six, deception two. I think we've already had an episode called "Whispers." "Ear-tonguing." You don't seem very satisfied. Natural 20! Breaking the game! Therapy! Therapy! My therapist would be so proud right now. I need stats on Lord Briarwood's sword. I have been dreading this for years. This moment right now. Since you've met me. I'm either going to be a new Percy or a new person entirely. I'm so sorry. It's so fun to torture you. You have a little cavern for this! Do you have a mini for the dark specter of my soul? I love you! I love you so much! And Grog was covering me, so Grog would've been closer to me, because I had him-- I am so happy right now. I'm going to run over to my sister. And cut open her bonds. Take out my sword and cut open her bonds. Get back! Run! And then, if I still have enough timing beyond that, I'd love to take a swipe at it with my sword. Okay. We haven't had a short rest, have we? MATT, LAURA, and Matt's understanding that we are all screwed. Orthax. Well that was really your mistake, then. I'll take it. No, I haven't. No short rest. 25. Nine points. All right. Yeah. 21. 13 because he's evil. She also ain't no hollaback gnome. Ain't no hollaback gnome. I hand her my sword. Yeah. Whoa! Do we know anything about Orthax? If only that were true in real life. Like inside of Groot gentle glow. I'm going to back out of the Faerie Fire. I'm going to go a little further back behind Scanlan. And I'm going to pull out Bad News and hold my turn. Ditto. All right, starting with Bad News with a sharpshooter. Thank god, because I rolled a one. 14? Firing again. Better! 26. That's... That's pizza! I'm looking for my dice. I didn't think this through. 25 points of damage. Yeah. Is that all true? Oh, okay. 7d6? Times two? A lot of us are outside the Faerie Fire. It's got disadvantage on its attacks. 14 and then 12. With advantage. Grace. Dignity. 12 feet. Damn! 26. Fuck. Really? I can't tell you yet. It's not my turn. Wow, in-joke. Please let this be what kills him. I yell, Delilah's getting away! How far away? And can I see her? Okay. And the question is-- yeah, I'm curious how far she got. Cassandra's right there. Fuck! Ugh. Okay, I'm going to-- I'm going to-- fuck! Ugh, goddamn it. I'm going to double my speed. I'm going to burn my turn double-speeding, trying to-- Trying to catch up. And then as I pass my sister, I yell, she went this way. She's invisible. She went this way! She's invisible! I'm so sorry, everybody. All right. Do I have-- I'm adding my bonus die. Yeah, I haven't used my inspiration die. 23. I'm going to follow that path of footsteps. I'm keeping an eye on them. Is she dead? Whoa! 19, then. Math, everybody! Attack of opportunity. Cassandra? I put my hand on her shoulder and gently pull her back. We have a lot to do. No, take everything. Vax, Cassandra, let's take her to the acid pits.
