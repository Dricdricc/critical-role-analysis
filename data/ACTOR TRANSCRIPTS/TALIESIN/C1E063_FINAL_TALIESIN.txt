I'm feeling the hag. Is anybody else feeling the hag? We're not feeling the hag, but I think we should avoid her. And we do have a direction to move. I'm pretty sure she's the hag. I'm okay with that. I, honestly I could use a bit of sleep at some point and I think moving in the correct direction, getting a bit of sleep somewhere safe... I'm working on that as well. If there was a time to not be us, this is the moment. Right now. He does, in fact, have a javelin of lightning. I feel like we've done enough damage for one day. I promise you, we're going to kill something very soon. Huh. That's weird. That's weird. I got a 19. 35. Or maybe things just got strange. New die. I'm gonna try and scope it. Ugh. Could be worse. 16. A pair of trolls. That we see. That was a thing, yes. They could be smart trolls. They're eating something that's stuck. Which could be us very soon. Let's keep moving. We're going to try and climb a tree. For a minute. I don't see a change, I'm not sure. Yeah, you have one, don't you? Let's see what happens. All right. Take him. I'll be fine. I'm gonna, I have a potion of climbing. Oh yeah. With advantage? Athletics or acrobatics? Okay. That'll do. 16. 24. Natural 20. I think we want to observe it and rest up. We do. We have the mansion. Really? It's been since the river. I want to see if I can find the source of the bog muck. I'm gonna get close enough to at least make out some detail. Is it a solid trunk, or is it like a combined trunk? I'm gonna back up and try and find a place to scan the ground, find a place to put a door for our mansion. Safe. Yes? No, but I'm close to it. Nothing, no. If I were animal life, I would live beneath the surface. Like the trolls. I think there's quite possibly things that live in the muck. Probably not on top of it. No, although if you find a log approximately two feet thick, I could certainly use that. A log, about two feet thick. Doesn't matter. It's fine, I've got a thought, so I'm gonna try something. I could use some sleep, and I've got a little thing to work on for the moment. Swamp shoes. I think some swamp shoes might not be a terrible idea. Thank you. Swamp shoes. Yes. I mean, not quickly, it won't help you walk quickly, it's not necessarily the most stealthy thing on earth, but you won't drop two feet into the muck every time you take a step. Maybe. The muck is unhappy to be there. It does make us sad to be around it. It's just muck. We haven't yet. Let's take a long rest, I mean. No, you didn't say anything. I'm going to make a jump to another tree. Oh my god. My potion has worn off, hasn't it? One hour. Seven. I want the mansion, now. It won't hold. I'm just gonna hold on. We just need to get in the mansion. It's fine. Sure. Give me a little bit and I'll do something to it. I don't really know what I can tell you, but I'll take a look. Thank you. I need that tree as well, let's take that down to-- want to help me with this before your nap or after? All right, I'll start on it, then you can help when you finish. I'm gonna go work for a little bit. I'm gonna make swamp shoes. They're very simple, but yes, I have to make a lot of them. And I'm going to be enlisting her help, it's literally just thin slices, I'm not making them super nice, I'm just-- Yeah, I'm gonna have her-- That's pretty much what I'm doing other than sleeping. I have to take a negative 10 for that, like that really removes 10? Let's burn that page. Can I remove that extra two from your charisma? I'm gonna wipe it out. It's proficiency bonus, plus dex. I hate you. I hate everything that you stand for. Oh, this is nice. This is, um. It's two 26s. I'm keeping the inspiration dice. And, let's see, and two 19s. They're not pretty. They're made of rope. You've been watching a lot of Olympics. I'm going for a full long rest after my crap. And there's food. Sail! You're my hero. Sorry. I just love that word. It was good, it was good. Do you speak rock? I feel like a terrible person, I think. It's just a great word, that's all. I walk in at this point and I'm just looking for some chicken. A dozen bakers. Is Keyleth still covered in goop? Do you have any left on you? I'm going back to my room. Can you roll lower? Just for fun while everything's going on, I'm running two passive experiments in my lab while I'm working on the shoes. I'm leaving some of the muck on some chicken that I took from the kitchen to see if it has any effect on flesh after a long exposure. And then I'm distilling some to see if I can even identify anything in there or anything weird. Do you have to roll for that? Metaphor! Metaphor! Ooh! Long rest, eat some chicken. All right. All right. Yeah, we're in my room. Making shoes. They're not, but thank you. Rustic. Very rustic. I'm proud too. You're not here. You were a bootmaker, that's very true. Huh. That's interesting. At this point, can I tell anything about the muck from just boiling it to separate components? Trying to just see what's in there. I'm assuming it's probably just death-paste, it's just rot. But it is decayed matter. The tree is producing it. Well, here's my question. What do trees need to live? Where is the sunlight? And the tree's alive. Well, it's got to eat something. This is what it's producing, and it's got to eat something. Maybe it eats trees. It probably does, but at the same time, you don't get something from nothing. And... life needs things to live. You don't get life from nothing. A little iffy. It's just a hypothesis, but what if the tree's carnivorous. Or omnivorous. It's very big. It might be a cannibal tree. Interesting. How do you poison a poisoned tree? Sunlight is definitely something you should put in your arsenal. Whatever it's not used to being exposed to. I don't think rot is going to be how we kill this thing. I think it's not going to be like the crocodile. It needs purification. I think it might just laugh poison off. I don't know. Nothing laughs honey off. Can you make honey in that jar? You've got very little brain, don't you? That's not what we're hoping for. I was about to say, I don't think it's much of a cautionary tale, really. Yes. I think that's definitely, I think light, I think electricity. There is water in the, was there groundwater of some kind? I'll watch this. Can we cure you? Tie a rope around her this time. Holding a rope. Terry. We got a name. Yes? I have no idea. I'm racking my brain and wishing I had access to a library. It's all pornography. Just the entire library is like-- It's like Beauty and the Beast, it's just pornography. It's more than an expression, it's legitimately something you do. Unfortunately, you need salt for that. That wasn't salt. That wasn't salt, that was something else, and I used it all for the cannonball. Inside the tree is the bow. I think if we remove the bow, I think if we find the bow inside the tree, I think that's how-- The heart of this tree. I think we go in. If I were the heart of a tree, I'd be in the center. I'm curious to see the library, I just want to see what a giant disaster this is. I think that's a shopping list. Yeah. Seemed like a thing. We gotta get the archfey out of the tree. You are so charming. And you have so much good advice. After a rest, I'm going to sleep. That would be great. But we're also getting the bow. I think it'll give you wings so you can fly. I am going to sleep, there's nothing that can be solved right now that cannot be solved over coffee and bacon. I will make bacon from chicken. That actually sounds really good. Yes, yes, good morning. It's all right. No. You're welcome. And... it's the lovely thing about a title, and I had one to give, is that it's, when used appropriately and properly, it's mostly there to remind you you don't really need it. Yes? Yes. Well, technically my sister, but yes. If that makes you feel a little better. Never do that again, that was very weird. It was really, it was... it was worth it to see the look on his face. It was quite wonderful. No, and it worked out well, because technically speaking there's only really about 15 foot square that's actually standing that you technically have a baronry over. And at the moment it is currently a shrine to the Raven Queen, so that works out well. No, she's just fixing it up for us. We did not give it to her. It wasn't mine to give. Just the title. You're welcome, and... it doesn't change anything. Yeah. Although I imagine you're eventually going to become very insufferable, but yes. Oh, you have to be... there's a thing. But we'll get to that later. There is a thing, I forgot, there is a thing. Yes, a thing, we'll get to that, it's really not important right now. That's if we survive, that would be very important, but right now it's not. No. We might. I think that's an excellent idea. Let me join you. I have shoes for everybody. They're awful, I'm aware. We're going to wear the shoes. They're swamp shoes. They're circular, they're like large circles, and there's like a base connected to them, and whole thing's connected together with ropes. It does. It will keep you from sinking into the muck. It will allow you to, you'll have to walk very slowly, you can't walk very quickly, and if things get hairy you can cut them off, they're just wood and rope, they're not that complicated. Yes. Move like a giant frog. You don't need them, though. You're the one person who doesn't need them. Talk to it, see what happens, and if everything goes terribly, we just retreat back to the mansion, it's not going anywhere anytime soon. I'm going to keep back in the treeline. I don't think we have one. No, no. It'll be fine. A tree is just a door that hasn't been made yet, remember. It's an old Druidish one? Thank you. Yes. I'll take the rear, then. Going in. (chicken noises) Then me. Way too tense to talk about all the great things Lootcrate will send you every month. Crates will just show you everything they have. Still going in. I have no respect for anyone who says we're not so different. No, no, he was being terrible. Oh. He was a dick. And for that matter, anybody who says we're not so different, that's usually a sign of a terrible person. Terrible person. Well, that's very fair. I was only not shooting him to be polite. 21. I'm going to dart to the right and keep about 10 to 15 feet distance away from the exterior wall, because that looks creepy as fuck. About there. First thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pull out Bad News and I'm gonna take a shot, and I'm gonna try and disarm him. So. We'll see if that does anything. Natural 20. It was the best, it was such a wonderful, wonderful-- A fan gave that to me, yes they did. Natural 20, and that means I don't even burn the grit for it, and that's arm-shot, so. Strength saving throw against a DC 19. Okay, so it maintains it. I forgot to cast Hex, but god damn it. That's fine. So, taking my shot... That went well. That's 19 times two, that's 38. That's 44 points of damage. Of piercing damage. I'm gonna reload. I'm gonna cast Hex. That's fine. Seems to be taking it. That's fine. I'm casting Hex. I'm giving him disadvantage on strength saving throws. I'm gonna take another shot-- Yeah, checks, excuse me. I'm gonna take another shot at getting that damn bow out of his hand. So we'll see if we can do that. Yeah, that's a 19, so that's 32 to hit. He can roll his saving throw. So no, he drops the bow. Bow's on the ground. That's a terrible roll. That's okay. So that's ten points of piercing damage and two points of necrotic damage. Bow's on the ground! Oh, shit. Acoustics. iPhones. iPad Pros. Apparently he can. We haven't found a winner. We haven't found a winner, we've just been hitting him really god damned hard. We're gonna set him on fire, we're gonna hit him with light, we're gonna hit him with things. You shouldn't have been. That hits. That doesn't hit. Okay. Okay. Do you roll that or do I? Yeah! You are doing some crazy shit. Sondur. Oh, you got the fudge end. At the very least, I might try and get him to drop the bow, and then you're gonna be the one who has to grab it if things get... 14. We're both prone, does that mean that we're in combat, or can I walk away from it and it doesn't-- All right, I'm spending half my movement to get up, and I'm backing up against the wall. Backing up against the wall. I'm not using Bad News, I'm going to use Retort, I'm going to try and, first thing I'm gonna do is use a bonus action to heal a little bit. Yeah. That's nine plus twelve, so that's 21. Figure that out when it's not my turn. Next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start shooting to try and get that bow out of his hands one more time. First shot... Retort, yeah. Same trick, but not nearly as much damage. That's 16 to hit? Firing again. That's another 16. 18 to hit? God damn it. Okay. That's my bloody roll. God damn it. 23. Doubled. I made a friend. That hits. That also hits. I'm fine. That's mean. Yeah, that was rough. I don't understand how magic works. Yeah. Oh no. Oh no. 12 helps. Number two? Maybe you have to roll it angry. Angry die. Always angry. That don't suck. And then he's on fire now, right? God damn it. That sounds like a handful of hate. That was like four dice. You're good. You need healing. It's a constitution? Ten. Damn it. Just hurt him, just hurt him. Did you use the cone? No, you can't use the-- oh, you could use the cone. Oh, don't make that face. Ish. Esque. Sharing space. I just watch this. I put my gun down, pull out my sword, and just start hacking at the tree. That's 25. 23. And 27. That's a thing that happens now. Okay, and so that's... (Travis elbows the set, which makes a loud thump noise) 35 points of slashing damage. All three together. Yeah, I just went thump-thump-thump. I'm going to move, I'm going to charge north, just to split the group up a bit. Yeah, actually if I can hug the edge a little closer-- Around that way, and then ten feet away from the wall. And then, bonus action to put my mask on in case anything more gassy happens. And then I've got a grit left, so fuck it, I'm gonna-- oh no, because I can't switch weapons fast enough. Never mind. I'm gonna call it. I took it back from you last game. 'Cause you weren't there. Yeah, you can have it back if you want, I just took it for the swamp. 19. 23. Yeah! Parkour. Watch out for that tree. Yeah, I'd be angry. God damn it. Bastard. I'm gonna do a missile snare. 23 points of piercing damage? That's gonna be 13 points of piercing damage. And can I use that four, I'm gonna take that four lightning, can that hit the glove? I mean, like, hitting, so-- All right, so that's rolling now, that's in play. Thank you. As you've cupped so many before. (singing) I believe in you, you can do the thing. Really? Burn it! I know. Had it worked. It was a good plan. Asshole! God damn it. Blight's nasty. Fuck yeah! All right. Okay. No breakup is that rough. I'm going to, I'm switching back to Bad News, and I'm going to reload and I'm going to try and, got that last grit, I'm gonna just try and get him to drop the bow. Part one. That'll do. 24. He has to make a strength saving throw. Made the save using a legendary resistance. Okay, that's fine, don't care. That'll do. That's 20 points of damage. He has to make a, it's strength saving throw. Yeah, he makes it. And just because nothing else seems to be happening, I'm just gonna burn my Action Surge and just keep plowing into him for two more shots. That did 20 points of damage. Taking another shot, that's 29. That's 28 points of damage. Hm? No, I've been doing damage. Yeah. Sorry. That's 20 points of damage and 28 points of damage. 22... wait. 20 points of damage on the first attack. Attack I just did was 28 points of damage. And then the third one. That hits, that's a 31. I do not crit on a 19. 18 points of damage. Lay into him! And I'm gonna run and try and get some cover on the ent. In the dead-ent. Dead-ent dead-ent. Very very fair. And he burned a legendary save. Yeah. Walking around like an idiot the entire game. I'm gonna walk up and grab-- Grab the bow, real quick. He was terrible. He was terrible. That was a terrible person. We have a mansion that's within walking distance. And if we have to, we will run. It kind of was. It is sort of sad that we didn't catch any theater. I'm going to saunter over. (in an exaggeratedly evil voice) We're a lot alike, you and I. Bleaaah. (normal voice) What an asshole, Jesus. Is there anything other than the bow worth looting on this terrible person, since I'm rummaging through his... Right. I've got it already. I know that's not nearly as much fun, but it is available. Toss it. I know, I was thinking that. Well, that's exciting. You don't know what it does. I had not had my coffee, I was tired, there was no bacon... I hate you so much. I need fresh air. I'm done. I did, but it wasn't much. This is good. No, we did very well. Let's go home. I'm, well. Do we wanna, is there a reason to stay or is it time to go home? I'm quite pleased. I knew it. I knew I should've asked for that portrait. What? What! What! What! No! Oh! Good day to you, Puck. Good day. Thanks for the art. Dear god, let's get out of here before something else happens. People get bitchy over here. Whitestone. Yeah, we're warping out. Ew. You got your bow. Yeah. Is that really a thing? Okay. Yeah! Roll for it. Roll for it, bro. Stay tuned for another episode of Critical Role.
