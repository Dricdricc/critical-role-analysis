Bear not included. I've got the feet. I'm not ready! [dramatic music] We all trade seats and then come back really quickly. I feel so dirty sitting on this pillow. So comfy. Yeah. Diplomacy would work out well, though. Hasum? Seeker Asum. Is he around? Do we see him anywhere? He hasn't had time to memorize all the ways he's going to fuck with you. There are that many ways. Now we hear shattering glass, don't we? I'm running with them towards the doors Actually, did you turn into an eagle? Can you carry me? That's fine; I need to get my gun. anyway. Bad News. 16. Will that also widen up the hole into that room? Where the real accents come from! Where am I? Rushing outside with them. Am I just there, or am I off the map? I have a very long range. What did we do before iPhones? Does it count as a mace? Handaxe? Oh my god, is something actually going to work? Pepperbox range is 150, but the Bad News range is disgusting. So I'll start with Bad News. (sighs) All right. First shot. (yelling) Sylas! That's a 30 to hit. (sighs) This is about to feel so good. I hate them, I hate them so much. Where's my other d12s? That's 17 points of damage. Is he looking at me? Okay, good, I'm taking another aimed shot at his face. Third shot, aimed shot at the face, while he was turning around. That's 24 to hit. (laughs) That's 28 points of damage, and he has disadvantage on all attacks for this round. Is that as far as I can make it? I'm going to take a standard walking speed 30 feet straight ahead. Swinging Bad News back onto my back, pulling out Pepperbox. Sylas! I'm getting his attention again. I'm going to start shooting with-- No, I don't think anymore. Yeah. So I'm going to be using my sharpshooter for this. That's 26 to hit. So that's, let's see. Oh, I need one of these, too. That's 22 points of damage and one point of fire damage. Same thing again. No, I put Bad News away. Bad News is empty. Ain't going to be a dick about it. 25? That's 21 points of damage. Shooting again. 18. Sharpshoot right now. I'm going to try and take out a wheel. 27. 20 points of damage. Is that a disadvantage because it only has three wheels? I want to walk over to the carriage driver. What do you know? I shoot him in the right hand. You're from Whitestone, yes? Well, you do now. I reload again and put it on his left hand. Frederick de Rolo. Where is he? Lady Johanna. Julius de Rolo. Vesper de Rolo. Whitney de Rolo. Ludwig de Rolo. Oliver de Rolo. You will tell us everything you've seen. No, they won't. Because I will kill you first. Tell me what you've seen. Thank you for not dying! You win another day. I want you to spend the rest of your life making up for the things you've allowed to happen. I now take the butt of my gun and I'm going to knock him unconscious. I don't quite know. I'm just rolling, but I'd normally get 21. Are there soldiers coming? Put him in a cell. I want to inspect the carriage to see if there's anything interesting about the carriage. Eight. The Briarwoods murdered the de Rolos and took Whitestone. I have proof. I was there. I would recommend, Uriel, dis-inviting them for now. He didn't even look down. He just said it. We haven't failed. It's not over yet. I'm not done. They're liars. My family is dead. I don't think we'll have to. I think they're going to find us. Vax. Thank you. Thank you for your risk. Yes, you were foolish, but thank you. Well, we're going to find out in a minute. And we have a prisoner. 12. You want to get right there, right? You just did math! Okay. I'm going to walk to the very edge of the spell right here, so I'm standing one closer to our friend there. Not just to you. I want to be close to the big strong schmuck. Is the Broker holding anything? Is he, is he using a weapon? Just a shortsword? Okay. Before I start to do anything I'm going to look at him, look him in the eye What is wrong with you? Don't you see there is nothing here for you? Run away before you die! There is no option! And I'm just going to start unloading. Natural 20! (yelling) Pepperbox. That's 16 points of damage. To the Broker. I'm just shooting at the Broker. That is doubling both of the dice. Now a sharpshooter shot. Sharpshooter shot misses. And another shot, seven, 19? All right, cool. That's eight points of damage. Blowing an action surge and firing three more times. That's 25... that's ten points of damage, plus four points of fire damage. Sharpshooter shot. That's a 22. That's 21 points of damage. Another sharpshooter shot with ice fire. Finally, I get the breakdown on that one. The gun jammed. I put it away. How many fired shots did I get? Was that five shots or six shots? Okay, so I'm out of-- all right. I don't have any more actions. Okay, I'm going to do something weird here and I'm going to hold you onto this. I'm going to get a little weird, and I'm taking straight chest shots and I'm just firing chest shots, and I'm just making a hole the size of a baseball in his chest. And as it happens, as I keep unloading, the gun still breaks and I'm still pulling the trigger. (yelling) You fool, your soul is forfeit! Die! Die! I'm going to look at the other two and start pulling out my bigger gun. And putting on the fucking mask. A d6 inspiration die? Oh, this is embarrassing. 17, wait with intimidation, 19. Mask, gun, fuck it. Also, just checking, does my glove still have a charge, by the way? Okay. I mean, is there any indication, like it would have a slight glow to it. That is the end of my turn. That is the tiniest cheat sheet ever. Lillith, does this mean you are free from those who are hunting you? Your accent good. We enjoy. Thank you for the target practice.
