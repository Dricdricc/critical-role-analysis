Ogre's nest. Nothing fun right now. 28. I rolled another natural 20. I sacrificed a small child to these dice. What is that strange orange thing, right here? That's a tree. Okay, good. So that's cover? Okay, so is there any way I can maybe get some partial cover right over here? Yeah. So I've got cover from the tree from this one until he moves, but I can see this guy? It is Bad News time! I'm going to bust out Bad News and take a shot. All right. They're pretty big, so I'm going to take the negative five to my attack bonus and see what that does. That's a 21. That's a good shot. Oh yeah! That's 17, 27, plus-- 33 points of damage. That is the end of my turn. Yeah. I am now going, maybe I shouldn't have done that. (laughter) (Grog voice) I would like to negotiate. Yeah! You're going to hit yourself in the head If he's going to hit you. He might not. I'm going to hold my turn. Bless you! Let's take a breather. For a moment, collect ourselves. I want to borrow Grog for just a second and ask these two if they've encountered the dragon before, and what its disposition is. Anything we should know. I was feeling weak. Ten. It was a one, wasn't it? This is my fault. This is all my fault. 17. I am. I lawyer quite well, but the hope is that we wouldn't actually break the contract in the first place, because that's complicated. We're not here based on other people's expectations. We're here because we thought we could handle this and nothing has changed. This changes nothing! Thank you. Would you like to use mine? I can make an attempt at this. I'm going to walk over and study the shattering position and see if I can find the weak point in the wall. Seven. Getting it all out of my system now. I'm going to take a musket ball, go over to the very center of the crack. Let's save the Fire Bolt. I'm backing up. She said, Fire Bolt. I backed away. I can't use acrobatics? Nine. I'm going to heal really quickly. That's unpleasant. I'll take one. But if he does have Stoneskin, will you let him charge? Ew. Oh. All right. I think we've found one. There's a trap right there. Perhaps if we're quiet and stealthy. Can we be quiet and stealthy? I have to set it off personally. I actually have to shoot it to set it off. That's hoping for an awful lot of things to go our way. More things than normally go our way, to be fair. Do we have a little bag we can put the jewels in? We have a second. I'm going to hand you my Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. Why not? We'll get it back, it's okay. You can't explode a diamond. Diamonds are forever. I would like to go around here. That's not me. And everything else in the bag, as well. I don't know if you have that spell. Oh my god. I rolled another 20. I don't know! I don't know what happened. 28. The little gingers come back out. If I take one shot, can I hold my second shot until an event? Can I time my second shot? Darn it. What initiative did you roll, again? In that case, I'm going to take a few steps behind that frozen creature right there. I'm going to pull out Bad News. MARY, SAM, and I'm going to aim for the face. I'm going to take a head shot on him. I'm just using him as partial cover. More or less. I'm using him as a steady and as partial cover as I take a head shot on the dragon. I'm not taking a bonus for damage, no. Oh. 15? I'm going to burn a bonus action and spend another grit point and do another shot. I'm taking my action surge. Come on. Yeah. Oh! 19! That's much better. Plus 12, that's 32 to hit. And that's 15 points of damage, and head shot means he's got disadvantage on all attacks for the next round. I feel a little guilty about that. I feel very guilty about that. Okay, I feel a little better. And he was the most useful he's ever been. I was in the 30s. 12. Still no hand-grenade. What do I do to shake the fear? Okay, I'm going to try and take a shot at it with a standard shot for right now. 17. Wait, and with disadvantage. I would like to really quickly then go into that little corner there for some cover. Oh, I didn't roll to shake off the fear. Five. Well. I don't know. What do I know? Does she not have sharpshooter? Do I not have some cover? 20. Okay, I'm going to-- That grenade is sitting on top of people right now, isn't it? It's going to hit you. Even if my attack is not against the dragon? Okay, in that case, I'm going to take a shot at the dragon for the moment. Forget about that. 19. Oh, that's nice. 26 points of damage. I have moments. No, I'm going to hold my position. I was about to say, before I do that, I'm going to use a bonus action to do a quick heal. I'm going to use second wind. That's 11 points of damage. You're in trouble. Can I take this moment of engineering success to try and pull a wisdom saving throw against my fear that I missed on my turn? Natural 20! (cheering) I built a thing! And it blew up! Kind of on purpose! I'm sorry. I'm a genius! I'm sorry! Sorry! Oh god, I'm clever. Good, you drained it. That's over with. All right, I'm going to take one last really good shot. I'm going to shoot him right in the face again. I'm going to spend my grit point and hit him in the face. Let's make this work. Yay! That hits. That's 31 to hit. I'm going to roll damage. That's 15 points of damage, but he's got disadvantage on all attacks until my turn. I'm going to move in this direction. Hug the wall. Yeah, I think right there. With disadvantage. With disadvantage. Oh, so there's no disadvantage roll for him to make here, is there? 15. 54? I'm out. I like my face. Do I actually roll? I did not roll a ten or higher. Grog's got it. Let's not have another Pike, please. Kill it out of spite. Make it good! Oh! What happened? Oh, look. It's dead! Can we cut that bastard up for scrap now? Ugh. That would be two white dragon eyes, one white dragon tongue, one white dragon heart, six white dragon claws, and 20 white dragon teeth. Very low nature. Start with the eyes. The tongue would be next. A heart. Claws and teeth. Claws, still. We have to get claws still. We still need claws. Six. Do we have an extra? We have one? 16. Whoa! I'm curious about the gloves, myself. That might be good for you, though. I have a two-handed ranged weapon, though, which you do not. No, Scanlan. I do. Ozwyn Grud? May I, as well? 25. Yes, of course. This is most likely going to good use, at the very least. I was just working that out. Lots of gold. It's 1,800 for the dragon eyes, 1,200 for the dragon tongue. 3,500 for the heart. 1,500 for the claws, and then how much for the dragon teeth? For all 20 dragon teeth. 9,000 total. Thank you. What were you thinking, really? Yes, you're moving. Tomorrow. Guest dragon kill.
