Roaches. I can be active in the chatroom. I'll be so active in the chatroom. I hope it gets the recognition it so should get. Rises above a cult hit. Comic went up on Wednesday. Two comics. What are you going to do? Our first Winter's Crest Festival together running around, causing havoc, being adorable. Just in time for Christmas. Eight weeks of cute. We need photography of the 19th century over here. I'm just saying we need daguerreotypes. I think it might be time to do it. Oh, Voxanukkah! I'll keep them coming. I don't think so. Briorities. Briorities. We've literally not had a conversation. Can I take two of the low ones, possibly? Actually, if I could steal two commons, just to be on the safe side. I offer the satisfaction of Vax knowing that I got them for free. Currently everybody looks-- I throw her one of my commons as well. Let's start making our way down there, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, but we'll have Vax scout ahead. Vax, we've discussed our new password. Do you remember the new password? It's now "Jenga, one one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand, four "one-thousand, five one-thousand, six one-thousand, seven one-thousand, eight one-thousand, nine "one-thousand, ten." We know. Yes. I consider the matter settled. Yes. But mostly because I fear her. We don't actually believe that he will listen to sense. We just can't waste our breath, really. This is going to be a very complicated evening. We just did. Cassandra? In your opinion, who's the more dangerous target? If we can. I think they would see through that. I want to see what they're building down there. And I worry that it would be dangerous. I can't leave again until this is taken care of. I think we're going to take the lay of the land first. See what we're up against. Vax? Magic sparkles. It does look like mithril, doesn't it? I will be right behind the-- Bear-Percy is especially disturbing. Cassandra de Rolo. Now that we're together. Copy. We'll just have to remember. I'll also say, if this was a gas trap, I would probably throw my mask on before passing it, as well. We live in an age of miracles and wonders. I'm moving up to the door. Did you make it to the acid pits? I don't know. I would like to get a better look. Are there markings on the walls? Is there any scripting? Get that out of the way. Nine? The roof? See what happens. I'm going to try something. First of all, does the construct of this at all remind me of anything? I'm going to take my sword and I'm going to go into the room and I'm going to lay my sword on the ground. Copper is a conductor. I'm having that thought. I'm going to try and slide my sword towards the center of the room and see if I can cause a short. With the piece of metal and get a positive and negative charge to hit and see if I can get a reaction. I had a torch. And it's not translucent? It's like an opal-like stone? I say we remove it, at the very least. See what happens. Does anybody have a good idea? In the absence of good ideas, bad ideas, I think, are always reasonable. I was going to look to see if there was one matching the one on the floor. Yeah, that's good, that's a 27. I'm going to go get my sword. We're not thinking about this clearly. Good. I walk over to the wall and touch one of the other gems. I stop, I pull out the gun, and the second those hit-- I've seen this coming, because fucking copper room, fucking acid. Ice shot to the one tube, do my best to reload as quickly as I can and ice shot to the other. I'm going to try and clog them with ice, at least temporarily. That's 15. 27. To hit. And that's ten plus three points of ice damage. It was a good thought. I want to get my second. Reload, second shot. 15? And all the gems are in our room, correct? Yeah. I walk up, I look at her, and I smile. It's all right. See you soon. And going to go right into pulling out the gun and preparing. We're going to take out these gems. We're going to be fine, but we have to do it now. I'm going to be fine. Go. Whitestone's pretty strong. You could stone, you could get out of this. I'm taking three shots at one of the gems on the wall. We have two down. No. Glass is specifically how you contain acid. I'm taking my three shots at the next gem. The first one was 21. And then the second shot-- dear god, it hits. 18, 20, 30. Third shot is 26. That's 14. 11 for the second shot, and 14 for the third shot. Well, it's fake, though. Four. But it could be that that's the only gem that's necessary. I'm running over to a gem. I'm going to hands-on and see if anything happens, and if nothing does, I'm going to pull out my sword and start whacking it. We need a fourth hand! I pull out my sword and start whacking it. Break your gem! The outside gem. Break the outside gem! (shouting) Break the outside gem! (muffled) Just fucking break the gem! (muffled) Kiss?! No, I just want you to break the goddamn thing! (muffled) Fuck the power of love! (laughter) (laughs) I'm hitting my gem, too. I rolled a 30 to hit. These things are really easy to kill. They get killed by hitting them with your fist. Did I finish killing my gem? Okay, I'm going to take a shot, if I have anything else to do. Can I take a shot at the gem that she just cracked? 18? That's 16 points of damage. Wait, I'm so sorry, how far out is the acid room from where we are right now? No, the room that the acid is stored in. Yeah. Oh, damn it. Okay. We can see you now, can't we? We have a rope. Very uncomfortable for everyone involved. No. No, I'm not. We'll see what this means. Let's go take care of this. We'll see. 24. 24. What's the roof look like above it? Except what happens when they get up there? I'm all right. Let's start making our way. We're going to have to Ghostbusters this. Flank them. There's no inside. It's just on top. Feast. I'm starting to make my way up. And you can join me. So I'm just walking up the center. With me. Trinket's with me. I'm heading up. I'm walking up the steps. I'm putting the mask on. I make my way to the top of the stairs. Sylas! A moment of your time. My hands are on a device which I have made that's on my hip that I'm ready to begin using at a moment's notice. It's the most ticklish French tickler you've ever seen, baby. We have debts to settle, Sylas. They were kind enough to make sure that I made my way here to face you. The darkness demands your soul, Sylas. I'm going to cast Hex on Lady Briarwood and pull my smoke bomb at the exact same second and throw it at them. I was shooting it right in front of them. I'm going to start running. I'm booking to the right, and I don't have any more actions, do I? Ugh, oh my god. That's stupid. Getting it all out of my system now. (laughs) That's how you get it all out of your system. Ten. Worst initiative I've ever rolled. Ten. (laughing nervously) We're going to be fine. Can she see me? Okay, because I moved. Bomb, then ran. There's smoke between us. I turned into a bear. It's Willow! It's fat Percy. That's a bear wearing a Percy costume. This spoon! Were you there for that fight? That's a great idea. Spectacularly great idea. He can see me? He can find me in the smoke? Okay. 34 hits. The other two do not. 24 still hits. That's 26 points. 23 points of damage. Sorry, just updating my sad little hit points. Two constitution saving throws? 11? A critical fail. My strength is a negative one. Oh, so my strength is at zero, then. 12. It's now ten, which means my modifier is zero. I just got blasted. What's that thing I can do? I'm going to use a bonus action to do my little healing surge that I can do. My fighter ability thing, which is 1d10 plus 12, so that's 18 points of damage back. I brought myself up a little bit. Just a little bit. And I'm going to shove the Diplomacy glove right into Sylas's face and try and do a straight shove to get him off of me. I have never used this before. I don't actually know how it works. Dex check? Plus ten to a d20. Thank you! That's much better. 22. 23 points of damage. I'm going to, Jesus Christ, okay! I can't really use my gun because I'm too close. I'm going to pull out my sword and take two more slashes and I'm going to run like a mother. First slash is a 28. And that's lame. That's 14 points of damage. Second slash is 23. And that's 11 points of damage. Now I'm going to book it towards Grog. That hits. I know. No. 15, 16, 17. 22. Make the right decision, girl! (blows raspberry) Nine. Oh, goddamn it. That could have been worse. (sings) Deo gratias! You're our cannon. Yeah. Just keep on him. Yeah! Yeah, that hits. I'm so excited about this new character I'm working on. Jesus. Okay, 14. Oh boy. I'll tally up the damage in a minute. Ignore the last attack? So that would have been-- my first save is 13? And that's 22, yeah. I'm going to figure out how much damage I just took. No, it's 27, 37-- oh, 41, you're right. I'm alive. I'm at the other side of the world, but you could probably get close enough to do something if you ran and not get in anybody's way. We can inform her of the map though, since she doesn't have a very-- She's 20 feet from Sylas. God-fucking-damn it. 30?! All right! And make another constitution saving throw. 13 points of damage? Saving throw. That's 18. Still, he keeps getting in my shit. There's just no getting the fuck away from him, is there? That's fine. Well he's in the 30-foot radius of light right now, so do my attacks have an advantage against him? Okay. There's just no backing away from him right now. I'm going to have to wait for him to try and break off from me through Grog. Yeah, I get it. So, everyone wants my bod. I'm going to take three slashes with the sword again since I'm too close to use the guns. 25? 14? I know, but I don't want to waste it on this. And 13. I want you to inspire other people. 12. Save it for a shot. Goddamn it. Yeah! Really? You're going to kill him with hugs. This is the most Keyleth thing I've ever heard. Jaunty! Goddamn it. Yeah! Damn! It's like looking at the Technicolor logo. Okay. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to pull out the Pepperbox. And I'm going to take a shot at Sylas, and I'm going to get him to drop his sword. So, let's see. Nope! Not yet. Just in case things go bad-- and I also just want to make sure-- that's a 26? But he drops his weapon. Now I'm going to take a shot at him. That's a 29. That does... ten points of damage? She's going to take care of this. How close am I to Lady Briarwood? Ten feet? That's close enough, I guess. I'm going to take a couple of steps back, and I'm going to do a fire shot and an ice shot with my last two shots. Oh, yeah. I'll fire shot with my next shot. Does she currently have advantage or no? Okay, so I'm going to also put sharpshooter on that. Yay. (counting) 26 to hit? So that's-- plus-- Oh, and plus the Hex! So that's (counting) 24 points of damage plus two points of fire damage. Let's spend an action surge and keep enjoying this! Why don't we take a-- Yeah, let's take a... violent shot on top of that. I use the violent shot action with the ice damage. Let's see what that does. Natural 20! This is going to be ugly as fuck. Oh my god. This is so fucking bad, is what this is about to be. Oh my god, this is going to be so-- let me get these additional dice. Okay, so let's start doing this. Do all of the dice rolls get doubled? All of the dice for this roll. Oh boy. Okay. (counts quietly) 42 points of damage plus eight points of ice damage. No, I've still got two more shots. Actually, I get my grit point back from that because that was a natural 20, so that was a free shot. I have two more shots, and then I have to reload. I'm keeping track. I'm being good. Let's hit her in the legs. That's 20 to hit? Yeah. 20 to hit? No, 20 total to hit. I rolled a 13. Because she has her disadvantage. She needs to make a constitution saving throw. DC equals eight plus my proficiency mod plus my dexterity mod. She made it. She didn't fall, but she still takes some damage, so let's see what she does. Ten, 12, 22, 28 points of damage. And because this is really annoying me, I'm going to give her a gut shot. Torso shot. Same thing, sharpshooter. 27 points of damage. And she has a disadvantage on strength and dexterity checks for the rest of the round. For one full round. I'm going to back up a little bit, for the rest of my-- Yeah, that way. (laughs) Yeah. Damn it, girl! Do it. Do it, girl! That lasts a while. I'm going to start looking at that door. No, no! No. No, let's not. Let's not. She's been here a very long time. Let's just knock her unconscious and let her be. Thank you. We can save it for later. I'm going to start working with that door. What does a common healing potion do, by the way? You picked up his sword? Good. That's why I had him drop it. Yeah, and so one of us, possibly me, could use it. Do I get my strength back, by the way? I'm just down? Let's go in. I took a minor healing potion. Is that 2d8? What's the greater do? I pull out Bad News. I'm climbing up. I'm heading straight up there. I head up, as well. I'm going to take 80 feet-- 25. I rolled a 19. Can I fire now? It's 80 feet? It's within the Pepperbox range. I'm going to shoot for the scroll with fire. That rolled really low. I can use that bonus die. I rolled within my-- Can I use the-- I'm going to try and fix it. No. Pepperbox is completely broken. We have two more guns. Do I still have-- are we still-- Bad News. Don't look. Jesus Christ. 16. It was the arrow, question mark. Keyleth's got shit. How good do you feel about a natural 20? I did. That was cruel. And then it bounced. I'm going to take a shot with Bad News because this is getting really ridiculous. I'm going to try and get her attention and get her to pay attention. Let's have a normal roll. Oh, for the love of God! So, Bad News-- Just barely! And I can try and get one more bullet to come out of it at this point, so I'm going to make one last attempt to make it shoot, after clearing the chamber. Better! Jesus H. Christ. 24. This is at least going to get her attention. Yeah, that's 21. 27 points of damage. She's still connected to her rope, though, isn't she? Parkour! I'll take a shot at Lady Briarwood, since I'm up here. I was. I forgot it on the last one. I remembered that I forgot it. That's 24 to hit. 13, 14, 15, 16-- 22 points of damage. It's a little late. I'm going to take-- oh my god. I'm going to take a shoulder shot on her right arm, and I'm going to try to cleave her right arm right off with the shot and see if I can leave her unconscious. Right arm. She has the rope. I grab it. I am going to grab the rope, and I am literally just going to jump off the side and I'm going to fling her up. Done. Good call. I've got hold of the rope and just trying to yell, toss her off! Because that way we can see if we can counterweight her back down. I'll ride the rope up. Oh, that's right. Never mind. I believe in you! She succeeded three times. I'm going to try and open the doors from that side to see if there's any way to open them. 11. Let's get her out of there. Whoa! We're not leaving this thing. MARISHA and I'm afraid of what blood will do to that thing. I'm taking Cassandra. Why don't we just open up the acid and let it pour down in there. We have to go that way, anyway. Once we get there, let's open the spigot, point it towards the doors, and let it do its work. Do some damage to the temple, and then once we're all the way out, we'll open the acid. It could just swallow the entire city and everybody could die. This is my problem, at the moment. She can earth shape. She'll be fine. 70 percent of her, at the very least. I'm going to do it once we're out. We're just going to go. Well, one and a half of them. Hey! That comic is-- Was free. After this weekend, it's one healing potion. Goddamn it.
