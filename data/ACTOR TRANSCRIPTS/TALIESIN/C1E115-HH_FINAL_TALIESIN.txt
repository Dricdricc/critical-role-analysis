You were so prepared. I don't feel well anymore. It's full of stars. We cannot open the art book. These are now available for order. They're beautiful and amazing and fabulous. Yeah, we have more or less evened that out now, so there's currently a standard rate, I believe, for international shipping. Yeah, there's a few that are a little tricky. It's weird. They were showing me charts and graphs to explain what happened this morning, and it was all very complicated, but it basically boiled down to our standard Benny Hill ridiculousness. MARISHA and An absence of Matt Mercer. We also have the scarves, although none of us have the scarves on right now. And many other things. That's a deep cut inside joke, right there. But hey, there's a comic book. We're in it. That's a thing. Still a thing. We haven't actually decided what we're doing next week yet, because it all depends on who's going to be joining us. We have a couple invites out to people, so we're waiting to hear. It'll be fun no matter what. Never. Yeah, no, we'll do a Moon Knight. You want to do a Moon Knight episode? I'll talk about Moon Knight. I love Moon Knight. Oh, Peter Porker? The Spectacular Spider-Ham? We can do a full animals episode. That would be a lot of fun. Your response via text when we texted you that that was happening was adorable. "Oh, "that's what that was. I suppose that's happening now." Eric and I were at the Overwatch arena. We were sitting, listening, and we both started squealing really loudly. I know, it's weird! It feels weird, doesn't it? How you doing? Yeah, we just rolled into town, picked up this guy along the way. We don't speak for him, not going to give him any credit right now. Seems like an okay guy. Don't let his personality defects fool you. He's a top man, knows his business. He's good at what he does, when he can do it. Worked his way to the middle, mostly. Top of his field, as a middle man. Worked his way from the bottom. Top of it. I'm going to try and sense honey. Double die. Nope. Wait, is this--? Nope. No no, the nose ain't picking nothing up right now. No. Pandas, they're fighters, not lovers. One. No, let's roll that. Four. I can hack anything. Anything you need. I can hack doors! I can hack people! I can hack cities, hack right through them. Hey man, you know how to hack? Then don't be talking to me about my business. What exactly do you do, honey badger? He's going to get hangry. You're not going to like him when he's hangry. I say we split up. You take the bottom of the road, I take the top. You want me to hack those decorations? All right, it's going to be a loud hack. If anyone tries to stop us-- I'm going to hack a couple banners down. We have a brief disguise. Going to hack a couple banners. We wrap ourselves in these banners that I've pulled down. Then they won't know that we're bears. We'll just be giant flying banners. They might be ghosts, and then they'll be prepared for ghosts. They'll never see us coming. Nope, ain't going to do a thing. Really leaning into it, isn't he? I'm going to hack the banners. Yeah! Two. Let's take them out. We're leading them away from the hats. We'll go into the woods, where you're supposed to poop. Eight. There's a second fez! It's inside the other hats. It's in one of the top hats. I rolled an eight again. It's me! I'm just going to roll the highest possible over and over again. There's a gray one, too. I get a second hat? I rolled an eight again. So now I rolled a six. I rolled an eight again. I rolled a three. I was just going to keep rolling eights until something else happened. The green bowler. Been a while. I'm going to wear a fez on a bowler. There we are. We are hirsute gentlemen! (growling) Bidet! I'm going to try to pinpoint the source of the honey. I'm frustrated. Yep. There's a lot going on. We got to get close to the source. There's too much happening. Bamboo's getting in there, it's mucking up the system, man. This is a delicate instrument. It's not bad! We're going places. Oh, I taste it. I got an idea. I'm going to try something. I'm going to wander up to Victor. I dip my paw just a little bit and go, Mm! I'm going to fill the fez with honey. With gunpowder honey. About a hogshead worth. Easily have a hogshead there. (amenable growling) We're in. That's Whitestone wildflower, touch of Feywild star iris. That's good. That's real good. (sniffs) We're going to need this for later. My god. I'm going to try to smell it again. Yes! Yes I do! That way! Good grabbing the stick. Yeah. I think I can hack it. Quiet. Damn honey badger don't need any lip. Vegas, are you sure you can maneuver this thing? You seen something like this before? This thing looks complicated. LIAM and Bigger than a honeypot? I put my honey in the wagon. Yeah, that really frees me up. Good thinking. The wagon with a fez full of honey. That's an important safety tip. He's wearing a fez, too, you don't want to get that anywhere near that. It's very flammable. Here's a question How do you spell Sun Kissed? And I can't read. I don't feel good about that. Careful kids, they've got sticks. It's a Far Side cartoon, just go with it. Did the cow just drop his stick? I take off my cloak and I'm going to try and bull them out into one of the buildings. This is all criminal. Bovine hacking. Classic. I rolled a four, I do not hack. Say, Trinket. You've got a great singing voice. Who would've thunk it. The Slayer's Take's got to have fingers in dozens of bakeries all over town. Their honey pots are sweet. Yeah, there was a honey pun. That's good. Yeah. What are the notes, man? Do I still got a scent on it? Yeah, it's this way. Bring the cart around! I was going to roll, but first, I was going to think about the last time we were in a tricky situation like this. No, I remember we were doing a roll through Whitestone. There was high alert. We were trying to book our way through the main square towards that big tree. The tree can give you a little coverage, but not nearly enough. That cart came by, and we kept walking right behind the horses on the cart. No one suspected a thing. They were sitting there, minding their own business, making noise like, "Bears! Look out, bears!" They didn't see a damn thing coming. Ba-da-bing. Can I get a point of criminal? Flashback, you go bear to criminal. Honey criminal to bear. Don't know why I'm still-- boy. Sweet syrup, I got me an idea. Hold on. I walk up. Just trying. Pull a cigar together, basically. Trying to stealthily grab a couple cigars. I'm going to light a couple. That's fine. It's fine. Now-- But it worked, didn't it? I'm fine. Right now I feel (grunts). Feeling good. Feeling fine. So... now? Yeah. No, smoking. Honey blazed. I'm going to hack that sword in half! I'm going to come running up and hack that sword in half. I'm going to hack that sword in half. With my claws. I'm going to hack it in half. That's what you gave me, man! Thank you. That's how I get away with almost everything in my life. Two dice, under bear. I do it! I hack the sword. You've been hacked. Say it! Say you've been hacked! I hacked you! Say it! (bear sounds) That's the only word of English I know. It got weird. No. I don't know. You're the brains. (flashback sounds) (laughter) Someday we're all going to look back on this and laugh, right there. Are they eating the hat honey? Don't eat the hat honey. (sniffs) I don't know. I have no real perception of distance that is actually capable of being communicated to a bunch of other bears. It's close. No, it's like two glens tops. It's close. A glen. Maybe half a hill and a dale. I am genuinely so pleased that all of this is happening. Yeah, and if you've got time tomorrow night, we got the confirm that we're going to be singing and drinking on Gather Your Party tomorrow night, so we're going to be having a pub sing. You get to hear me sing. Our cloaks, our hats... A fez of explosive honey. Whoa! One. Just one. I know you've got four. Just one. You apparently don't like them. (sniffs) I'm trying to pinpoint the location of the honey. I think we've come to the right place. Yeah? Don't tell me how to do my business. Can I hack the mainframe? (laughter) I do it. No, my whole face is in the pipe! Oh, there's a firewall. They've got a firewall. I don't think they got me. No, we're going to keep it very safe. I think we've got to go around the side. I think that's our best bet. It's deep inside. They've got it definitely under heavy security. I don't know, maybe we finally heard one. Success. More than half. Tie-breaker. Honey absolutely burns. Hey! We're all hungry. We all want some honey. Some of us want some bamboo-- that's weird, but that's okay. You're the smallest. Just take a look. Never happened before. That's very old for a honey badger. Ah, the Marisha "no fucks given" voice. What the fuck do you need, motherfucker? He's doing something. We almost made it. Dollars! We're on either side. I'm going to push against the side of the wall. I'm going to try and very slyly snatch his earring in the commotion. I may hack the ear. Try to hack the earring. I'm going to try and grab it and put it on my ear. With hacker advantage. Going for it. No, I fail. I had totally forgotten that there was any relation. No, this is like Captain Planet. You're Heart. Yeah, we're getting everything. Is it digital? Slayer's Cake. Everything biscuit. We've got to get in. I want to take a look at that security room. Use him to prop the door closed. All mead is honey mead. I want to take a look at this weird security system that they have here with all these mirrors. Are they viewing other rooms? Isn't it, though? Isn't it kind of fucking important, really? I think I can hack these mirrors. I want them to run a loop. I want to throw them on a loop. I'm going to mime keyboarding, but in doing so, it's going to somehow affect a magical spell. Yeah! Double two. Motherfucking honey barrels. We hit the mother lode. I'm starting to believe! We're clear. What?! Wow. This is insane. No, I get it. This will definitely not come in useful at all. This is useless and dumb, and I can't wait to do it. Ready for an Eggo Waffle. I've upgraded to Eggo. Never better. That I can't tell you, but I bought us some time. The last thing he saw before going unconscious were panda testicles at full speed. As he screams-- That's the most useful panda testicles have been in a long time. I'm just going to point that out. No one looks up. Do I smell honey in the kitchen? The Grog Strongjaw, of the Northampton Strongjaws? I don't know why I went there. He looks big. Quick question which plan comes first? Is it plan A or plan C? That makes sense. I don't know what that means! Does that mean that a young Jason Charles Miller looks like a honey badger in a cowboy hat? Is it a door or a gate? Can we see past? I can't see any honey? I've got an idea. You've got a tiny bottle of honey. You've got a tiny bottle of honey, right? Wasn't someone given a teeny-tiny bit of honey? It'll do. I'm going to look around. Are there cups or something around? I put a little bit of the honey into the empty pint. I'm going to try and toss the cup past Grog into the pantry. Quietly. No, I want to throw the cup into the pantry. Will that wake him up? I'm going to stare at the cup I just threw. I don't get advantage, I just have to roll for it, right? One. I'm going to start figuring out if I can open this pantry door. I'm quietly working the pantry door to try and get downstairs. I didn't think much past this. Considering that bears can have very stealthy picnics-- I've got a plan to get us in this door. We've got to move. What number am I thinking of? She can't hear us; it's fine. Works for me. We've already taken care of the security camera. There will be nothing on Twitter other than bear puns. That's some hot pee, man. I don't know. It looks a little weird. I can try and hack it. I'm going to try and hack one. One. Can I find an off switch and click it? Hacked it. Cookie. Let's see the spoils of our work. It's really about honey. Oh my god. What is wrong with you?! Yeah, I'm into it. What the hell are they singing? I have never been so proud of you. Why do I always get a warped one? You're a disappointment to everybody. Everything we've worked for. It's all honey from here on out. Just honey. Everything. Let's grab the honey and run. I'm grabbing honey. We'd better move. I'm going to create a distraction. Let's get this honey out into the cart right now. I'm going to do the same, as well. I've got this, guys! Are you pee shy? I have something I can do, but it's not going to be pretty. I take the fez of honey, and I throw it at the Bearracuda. No. No. I don't know what not throwing a hat full of honey looks like. We've got to roll, kids. I teleport towards the cart. We're taking off with the honey. I grab a little jar of honey. Toss it down. If anyone asks, we have no idea where it came from. I wonder if it was Sam Elliot at the bar telling that story. "Well, Trinket had quite a time." Holy fucking shit. And get two bears in a trenchcoat?
