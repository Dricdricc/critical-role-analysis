This is why I feel bad in not reading the announcements, now. That sounds like fun! Wait, is it this? You can make your own art book. I'm very excited. I was not aware this was coming down the pipe. Thanks to the art book, I know what this is called. It's called spot gloss. Thanks to the art book, I know it's got a spot gloss cover. You can rub it for luck. We loved our Dread shirts and were like, it's a shame they don't glow! And they were like, next time. And we're like, man! It's the door of the house, right? It's from a boutique! If you have a menu of breakfast beers, that would be most gracious. I have to catch my breath. Okay. My name is Bundle. I'm a dwarf. I've got a very, very nice lime green robe. Thank you, I'm very proud. I'm a priest and I've been studying for quite some time. Learning my trade, perfecting it. I'm a bit behind. I mean, I've got some younger brothers that are doing much better than I am, and certainly they're succeeding more and going further, and that's fine. I'm doing my best. I'm taking my own pace. Going a bit bald and I'm trying to do my best to bring it over, and it's going into a-- it's not a great beard, but I use the ham hocks to liven it up a bit. And I feel like I'm making my way at my own pace very well. More beer. All ten of them? Oh! Doesn't have to match. As long as it's lime green. There was a fisherman who did like 25 of those little red plants, but this sounds better. There's your trouble. You left it unlocked. You're making assumptions, I feel. That's a lot to just assume, just taking your first look. I take a look at the lock. Oh, boy. Oh, wow. Seven? Lock appears to have been broken by blunt force. I don't know. This is why we pay him big gold bucks right there. Or they're prone to crawling. They could be crawlers. That's some mean crawlers. Grease it up and he'll squeeze right in there. Wax the corners and push him through. We're all a little squishy. I'll go right in the middle. 15. Lavender. No? Never mind, that's just me being a nuisance. I've never talked to one before. Do I have time to get one attack in? 14. 14. Eight. Everything hurts, one second. I'm finding a thing-- I know, this is so difficult. I'm going to quickly cast Mass Healing Word on everybody while I, not even get up, I'm going to sit up and cast Mass Healing Word on the group. Oh, that's right it's auto. So, d4 plus wisdom modifier. That's six. And I'm going to use my bonus action to create a Spiritual Weapon. A giant hammer that looks a little bit like an anvil that's bigger than his hammer. It's going to manifest right above the main kobold's head ten feet up. Does it get to take one hit? Yeah, I'll go for it. That's 15? I'm getting up! And I use my movement to stand up and shake off. Yeah. Yeah, no. What's the check again? God, why am I rolling so bad? Ten. I'm going to maybe do a Prayer of Healing. Also, technically speaking, I have Disciple of Light, which means-- Would everyone have gained an extra five points? I can't do Prayer of Healing while we're walking though, can I? It's just verbal. Ten minutes to heal everybody up a bit. So that's 2d8 plus my spellcasting ability modifier? Oh my god, really? Yep. So that's nine points of healing to everybody. We've got rope. What did you roll? Well, she rolled a 20. Oh, I can do it. So I pick up a rock and light it up, and toss it in front of us. Just keep kicking it down. Could make a glowing salad of some kind. Well-- Let's not look a gift horse in the mouth. A gift rat. Orange? And the other two were-- What's the third? You only live once. Orange. I take the orange. Oh, 20. How about mine? I have the orange. Down the hatch. Oh, that helps because my constitution's really low. Eight. I heal six? I'm also going to cast Lesser Restoration and make the poison go away. It's weird he's selling mushrooms to random people in caverns like that. Come on! Natural 20! About fucking time! There we are! No! I'm going to use Thaumaturgy to make us all look really fuzzy, in and out, if I can do that. Ooh! I hadn't thought this through. Can I make the staff look like it's made of snakes or something? Can I Thaumaturgy? Oh, slowly. Okay! Slowly making our way around the existential crisis. Now I want to do Russian now. Yeah, you dragged me onto Silverhand! Totes fake. Well, I'm cool. How did we agree that you get the epic loot drop? See, this would have been an appropriate place to build bridges that are kind of iffy. Two of them, even. I want to take a quick insight check and give him an eye. I don't trust this one. That's not bad. That's a 16. With darkvision, could I see them? All right. I'm going to try and go for the central platform. Could you fly over to the-- Yeah, lead the creature over to that section. I'm going to try and cast Hold Person on the creature. God, it won't work on him, will it? I got 20. You can land wherever we need to be. Oh! That's a 24. Not you. Not even a little. You're so soft and squishy. No. Well, you only live once. I'm going to make a run for it. Fuck it. My strength is 16. I'm going to cast Sacred Flame, which I know will do very little on him, but it might temporarily irritate him. I'm going to run the opposite direction. Oh, it's an action to do that? Should I burn my action running? Oh my god, yeah, that hits. I can live with that. I can live with that too. God, if I have to do an action, I hope I can get an action before this happens. Acrobatics check, oh god. Because I'm an idiot! 20. So where am I now? I did a quick Cure Wounds back to 41. They're not bad. Well, I mean, I hear they're not bad. No, no. I mean, well, no. Well, no. You're a fun guy. I'm going to start making my way that direction no matter what. Sure. That's all right. 19. I'm going to throw a Cure Wounds at that to help with that. You get 11 points back to help. Power Word Shield. It means add 16 that you're about to probably lose. Seven. Seven. Thank you for that cold resistance by the way, that's really cool of you to put on this character. I know, bring it. Ten. I'm out. I've got a healing potion. Yeah. I'm cool. 4d4 plus four (coughs). I'm running. No, I'm out! I'm so excited! Not a natural 20, but 20. 20. That's mean! Worth it! I'll do a Mass Healing Word. We could use our hit dice, or I could do, yeah. Actually, I can do a thing that might help. Where's the thing where I can make it so we all get max healing no matter what? Beacon of Hope? It's Beacon of Hope. So I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope on everybody so for the next minute, I suppose it's just-- will this work for hit dice? Never mind. We'll just do the hit dice. It's been so long! Wow, that was awful. Boy, I'm not. And I'll Sacred Flame as well. 21! It finally happened. Just for fun, let's do-- where is it? I keep losing everything I'm doing. I'm going to do a very standard Guiding Bolt. And a Sacred Flame attack. I'm going to go for a two-fer on the big kahuna. Oh they're both actions? I thought it was a bonus, never mind. This is so hard to do, it's been so long since I've done this. I'll do a standard Guiding Bolt at this guy, and see what happens. Here we go, Guiding Bolt. That's a 19. Guiding Bolt is a 25. That's 4d6 radiant. Ooh! 16 points of radiant damage. Yeah, the next hit against him has advantage, and yeah, I'm going to give myself a quick Healing Word as a bonus action because I'm really low. All right. I am at 29 points of health, that's okay. Yeah. (groans) It's going to take an action to put myself out, I assume. I would like to put myself out. Okay. Do I get a bonus action? So for a bonus action I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon at 4th-level, because I think that gives me an extra d8 for spiritual weapon. All right, so I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon. I basically want to summon what is basically a big chomping mouse trap. I'm going to take a whack at the king's head with a giant-- I'm going to smack it right into him. Does it auto-crit, if it hits? Oh, it's also advantage on the attack. I rolled a 17 plus-- Yeah, 23, but it's an auto-crit anyway. He's still stunned. So that's 26 points of damage. (snapping) I'm going to back up a bit, with my movement. And get a little bit of cover. I'm going to Channel Divinity and quickly throw seven points of healing at everybody, and myself. Every little bit helps. I'm going to, just for fun, take a swing with the mousetrap at the giant flame beast to see what happens. That's a 14? I'm going to turn and run to the latrine. Aye! Then I'm going to turn around and run. First thing I'm going to do is attack with the Spiritual Weapon, as my bonus action, so that's-- oh, that probably hit. 23. 23 with the Spiritual Weapon to hit. All right, that's fine. Let's hit this thing with the mousetrap again. Plus my spell attack bonus, so it's 16 points of damage. Then I'm going to use my second Channel Divinity Preserve Life and put 30 points of health into you to keep you awake, and I'm going to take five for myself, then I'm going to run into the latrine, as well. Live by the candle, die by the candle. I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians at level three. Spirit Guardians is different. You're thinking of Spiritual Weapon. This is Spirit Guardians, so if he's within 15 feet of me, that's going to be a thing on his turn, if he's within 15 feet. Also, he's slowed by half. But I'm also going to hit him with my Spiritual Weapon. Mousetrap! Goddamn it. I miss. Can I have my die back? Is he within 15 feet of me now? He has to do a wisdom saving throw. That's 3d8. 12, so six points of radiant damage. Take 2d4 plus two. Good things. We're running! Yes. We're running. 19. 14. Is she floating to the surface? I'm going to follow her up, then. Healing Word, level two; Healing Word, level three. If I use my Healing Word not knowing that she was dead-- did I use my Healing Word not knowing she was dead? Because I'm out of magic, at that point, if I've used two Healing Words. All right, that'll do. Oh! 24. Revivify on this one, Healing Word at level two on this one. Big dwarven punch in the face. Wake up! You owe us lunch.
