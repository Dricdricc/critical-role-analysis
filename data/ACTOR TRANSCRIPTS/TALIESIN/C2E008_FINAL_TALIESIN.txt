You have fluff on your chin. That's currently available in the store right now. Well, there's one surefire way to make sure that he's all right, which is, we get drunk on something really expensive and listen to the stories of all the people we just saved so you can feel better about everything that just happened. And we're going to spend a ridiculous amount of the money we just made. Yes, you, the small one in the back. I like manacles. Those are fancy. I'm curious, can I try them on really quick? No, I got to unstrap them. I'm holding them up-- Yeah, this is nothing. Instead of setting a book on the ground, let's sit at a table at a pub or bar. I require drink and lumbar support. Yes? On it. I'm going to just literally yell at the top of my lungs in the middle of the crowd I'm looking for the best pub in this bloody town! Onward! Anybody who tries to buy me a drink, I slip a silver into their pocket. Let me know how low we get. When any time we let them buy us drinks, I'm just going to put a silver in anybody's pocket who's buying us drinks. Done. 20 god damn dicks. What does the wand do? I'm taking his drink away. You don't get to drink. First party death. It's very pretty. It's very nice. Who had the red oven mitt? Does it make a very good macaroni and cheese? Nott, why so serious? Do your thing. Today has been the most profitable day in my life. I have never seen so much money cross my path. This is ridiculous. Is somebody just going to show up and say I-- I'm going to watch this. Oh, you're going to do your thing. Dear Mr. Mayo. We relish the time we've had together. You don't know. No long rest for you. Oh, I'm going upstairs, I'm going to pass out on the floor. We have to leave a paper trail, is that a thing that actually has to happen? I can buy that. Passing through. No. That's a fancy inn. Yet! (laughter) I was trying so hard not to say it. Just been sitting on that shit, haven't you? You may be my new hero. I don't get a bonus, right? Okay, no that's fine. Oh, I wouldn't have heard? Very fair. Or not avoid him. I'm all right with that. I'm wearing one right now. No, I'm not. I'm actually just built this way. I could be, I'm built like I am. Extremely charming. Wearing a girdle. (laughter) Oh, she makes her way back every now and then. She can. I forgot to say this is the most pleasant experience I've ever had at a city building before. I could get used to this. It's like you were born in the circus. I'm so impressed. Insight check. 20. All right. Birthdays are shite. Did you have one of those sneezes that actually break something? We should go. Oh the open road. I could drive this thing. With an 18 bonus. That was a good one. It's the-- LIAM and I'd say we pull off if we see something really nice. I did! 19! Thank you, Gil. For the record, we're hiding all of our valuables. If that's okay. Making sure everything is stowed. I would assume we're hiding all of-- Yeah, I know how. Yeah, let's do it again. This is perception? 14. Yeah. Set up again. That's a griffin. That's only fair! I'll take watch number one! Six. I shouldn't have touched this die. This die has been nothing but trouble. Oh, you're so polite. How could I refuse? I just get up. I'm not turning around. Both my scimitars or just one of them? I'm just going to walk to the cart, then. I'm walking to the cart. I wouldn't touch that. That might, ooh. There's a severed head in there. I'm going in the cart. I'm just trying to wait for the first crossbow bolt, and I'm going to hit them with a Vicious Mockery. Can I Blood Maledict one of them, or no? Okay. Oh, okay. Never mind. I pop out of the cart, and I'm holding the giant glaive. I light it up. This is a really terrible plan. I'm going to say I'm going to use Devil's Tongue Come on, we're all friends here. Why don't you just walk away, leave your things, and just admit your defeat? It was a good try. No, this is not Vicious Mockery. This is Charm Person. Yeah, nope. Now that the leader's dead, who's the de facto leader here? Speak up, be bold! Do you know parchment-shears-stone? Do you know that game? Pick your leader. Step forward. Would you agree that the previous leadership of this group has probably failed you on some level? Look where you are right now, son. It was a bad decision! Perhaps you should rethink your line of work. Right. All right here's the deal, if everyone's fine? Maybe. Put your clothes back on, this is just embarrassing, all of you-- don't pick up your weapons-- Do not criticize new management until it's had time to take full effect. All right? Now, line up. Line up. Nine. Eight. Now you're all going to leave tonight. You're going to find something better to do with yourselves and remember, no matter how you die or where we can identify your bodies without the heads. So be careful. I'm going to give, in a line, one gold piece each to each of them in the row. Now for this, you promise that your terrible bandit days are over because you're really not very good at this. I mean, we were barely paying attention, this is pathetic. Well let's not cast aspirations on new management, it's only been two days. You're all walking away with one gold. That's about as well as this night could've gone for you. There's so much syphilis. What precisely did you have in mind? I mean, unless anyone else has anything to say? Okay. That's a very bold decision, well done. You're welcome. I'm going to gather the swords and the crossbows and put them in the cart. Well hey, more kindling. I'll take Loo. It's 200AM on a Sunday at a Starbucks right now. There's nothing. I don't even know what you do with that much money, this is ridiculous. You put clothes on your horse? That's a great idea. Insight check. Is she full of bullshit? All right. 12. Damn it. If it was that interesting, why can't you remember it? That's fair. How many sword and crossbows and random things did we pick up? Two heavy crossbows. Two heavy cross-- Oh you've got--? Yeah. Two light. Two heavy, two light, two hand. Party's over. Wow! Oh yeah. Are you sure? Have you checked? Hold on. Yeah, that's rain. That's a little water. I'm going to fold my coat up and put it away, just vest and vestiture. There's an old cemetery? I'm going to crawl over there on my horse as well and get a feel of it. I'm going to pick a random one. Anything undead, anything...? With advantage, or no? Natural 20. I'm cleaning off one. Nothing. Six. I'm going to take it back anyway. Of course. That's very interesting. LAURA and East. East Best Western. East. This is the best thing you've ever done. Mechanical croissant. Stanneras. What doesn't, really? This is a game of trust. Forgive our friend, someone attempted to mug us on the way into the city, he's still a bit sore. We'll probably be staying at the Leaky Tap. We're trying to keep a low profile. Perfect for me. Definitely perfect for me. Would you say there's a reasonable bathhouse for someone who's-- --and complicated, in the horns? Somewhere I can take a nice bath in peace. Don't want to scare the locals too much. That'll do it. I throw another gold at him. You are a fount of information. You can be frank. More of an antique collector. We're looking forward to seeing you again. To the inn! No. Don't trust trusting people, they're just the worst. No, I have full faith in untrustworthy people. I'm going to find mulled wine. It's cold, and I want to be warm. We'll watch the cart and we're going to take the cart to find some mulled wine. So glad we're not really outside, we're only physically outside. We get to be at the table, and it's so nice! It's like "Poor Matt's soul." LAURA and (whispering) I'm going to kill you. A clutch of objects. I can think of uses for that. I'm not here, goddamn it. Did we find mulled wine? Did we find a wine vendor? If there were any little confectionaries with that too, we would have bought whatever they had left. I got it. We bought enough for everybody. I have one. They're really bright and garish. Really good. It's the stuff they serve at the German Christmas markets. There's pastry and mulled wine everywhere.
