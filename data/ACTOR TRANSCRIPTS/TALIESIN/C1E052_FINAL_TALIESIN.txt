This is the one that comes with the Harry Potter socks. This fabulous Labyrinth t-shirt, which Travis is sporting. I keep all my stuff in these boxes. Who's hosting the new series-- Oh, fuck. I'd better start working on that right now. Oh. It's going to be great. No, I'm having a lot of fun. We're putting it together, and-- Participation awards all around. Participation. A million people go, huh. What are you? What the fuck are you? Oh my God! I mean, that's not amazing. That's better. 14. 14. I'd rather have my low roll here than for anything else. At least ten. Hunter's Mark. Okay. We're not panicking, no, not at all. This'll be fun, we'll see what happens. All right, first thing I'm going to do is cast Hex on Kevdak, on the asshole, I'm going to Hex him. So he is now enveloped in my dark smoke of death. He's also now at disadvantage on all strength checks. That's a thing. I know, I'm so happy. I'm going to take a little step back to get a slight bit of cover from those archers for when they start hearing the big bang-bangs coming from the house, to get half-cover, so I can still-- I'm going from my current vantage point, to about seven o'clock, eight o'clock. Yeah, about there. For a little bit of cover from the arrows. And I can still see Kevdak. So if I wanted to take my little pistol and start carving a little-- and I've got a nice little chunk of bone I can see in his arm-- can I take a sharpshooter disadvantage to hit that point? So I'm going to shoot with sharpshooter specifically for his arm. Oh. Okay. I'm going to take a shot for the elbow. I'm going to try, yeah, on the visible elbow. I'm going to sharpshooter through that shit, see what happens. Okay. And I'm happy if you want to put any weird disadvantage-- No, I don't, because I'm at distance. Or do I have advantage be-- Oh, he's paralyzed! I have advantage on the attack. Okay, that's fine. But I get the bonus ten points still. Okay. All right. That's fine. Natural 20. Should've used the big gun, really. All right, that's okay. So that's, oh, hello baby, you're over here. Actually, I'm going to use the pink one-- 400 feet. I'm scary. I know. Sorry. I know, I thought about that. Come on, baby, no whammies. Do I double the dice? Okay, so that's 16, (counting), 32 points of damage for the first shot. I'm shooting again. Same thing. 17, good enough. 17, I'm rolling good. No, it cancels out because he's-- it's no advantage, no disadvantage, right? (counting) 25 to hit. That hits. That's the title of my, '127 Hours With a Gun'. I know. I actually, also, I rolled the wrong die, he didn't take nearly what, that's okay, so here. I know, too late. I know. I fucked that up. Yeah, I know, so I did okay. Five, six, seven, eight-- (counting) 24 points of damage. Same elbow. Do you have a d6 that I can borrow? I'm going to go for my third, can I borrow your pink d6? I want to Bowie this shit. Yeah. I want to be flamboyant as fuck. All right. Going to call it. 14. (counting) 24 to hit. Goodbye, elbow. Eh, well, not bad. (counting) 23 points of damage. All right. I'm calling it for now. I haven't burned any grit yet, I'm so excited. Ironically, crushed by a tree. Curse you, nature. Strength check or save? Oh, damn. Does he still have disadvantage? Five? Five? Hundreds of text messages. Clang clang clang. She's made of armor. She's made of armor and they're people with sticks, with sharp sticks. Not in one round. I would like to remind you that potions are a bonus action. Thank you. Whew, you are a tank. I gave you the big debrief with the arrow, I gave you the how-to-- You've been doing it all night, too. I figure, you know, it's only fair. No, you've had more than one. We've been counting. I'm looking at him right now, actually, I've got my gun in my left hand and I'm looking at him. I smile the whole time. Bring it. Do not fuck with Reed Richards. He will fuck you up. That hits. That, that also hits. 11 for the first one? I take it in the shoulder. That one I'm going to catch. That's 14, so not only does it do no damage, I actually take it and catch. Snap it. And the gun is going to turn to look at him. Thank you. Don't talk him out of it. It'll be fine, it'll be fine, things are working. I was really hoping you were going to come up with a-- oh wow, that's actually-- never mind, I am not disappointed at all. You asshole. All right. This is going to be fun. That asshole who just shot me, I'm now aiming at him. And I'm going to push him off the roof, this'll be fun. So, pushing him off the roof, am I going to do extra damage to him, or am I? Well, I mean, I'm debating whether or not to sharpshooter it to do-- no, I think I'll just push him off the roof. It's funnier. 28 to hit. Non-sharpshooter. But I'm doing a torso shot. So he gets no save, there's no save for the torso shot, he's going to take his damage and move ten feet away from me. So. That's 14 points of damage, of piercing damage. Fine. I'm going to reload, and now, what am I going to do? Let's see. Surveying the field, trying to make some decisions. I can't. Well! I can hit Greenbeard, I'm going to hit Greenbeard. He's got the magicky creepy thing, right? All right. Well, we'll see how things go. Let's do a sharpshooter shot at him right now. Let's see what a little bit of damage does to him. So sharpshooter with Retort. Don't miss. And my pistol goes (breaking sound). (groaning) And I'm putting it away, so. Dice are doubled, too? The weapon's within five feet. Thank you. Suck it, nerd. Dear god. Can you roll poorly? No! Oh my god, Sam. Oh my god. Does he get an attack of opportunity? How do you own this many models? There's no should'ves, this is what we got. That's pretty good. Stop it! Don't be helpful! I've got a Scrooge McDuck-sized pit of Xanax at my house I'm just going to dive into. Attack of opportunity. To be fair, she's a bit winded. Well, that hits. All right. 18 and 18? I can use the-- yeah, I only have one reaction, so. All right. I'll take that. I'll fight that one, I'll contest that. Gloves of Missile Snaring. It's a reaction. It doesn't say, I can make an attempt to catch. That's 14 points? Dexterity modifier, 11, so I can reduce it to three points of damage. I still got hit, so. Oh, Jesus. With his broken hand? She's up 60 bonus hit points. 10d6. Yeah, but you're also getting pummeled by arrows. So maybe standing there is not necessarily the-- He's going to take a whack at you in a minute anyway. I was going to say, I can't kill Kevdak, he just healed for-- Oh, seven hit points. He healed him 70 hit points. Is he still raging, though? Okay. No, I can't do that, can I? I look at the guy next to me, I'm going to take a look-- oh god. I'm going to take a running jump off the front of the house. Straight into the-- No, I'm going to jump for the other house. Is it not an acrobatics, I can't do an acrobatics, I can't parkour this? My hands are free. I'll take an athletics. What do you think, athletics or? Oh, no no. I'll acrobatics it with disadvantage. Yeah, I. Yeah, no. I rolled a one. My AC's 18. I'm fine with that. Okay. Don't care. Who can I see from my perspective? Okay, I'm going to, as a bonus action I'm going to do a quick heal. Second Wind. Just to make that go away. God, that's amazing. 18 back, so, I've got-- And ow! I'm going to pull out the big gun and I'm going to take a nice heavy serious look at Kevdak. What am I going to hit him with? I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot in his face. I'm going to go for a headshot with the big gun. A headshot. With the big, with sharpshooter. Trickshot on sharpshooter. I'm doing a combo. 23 to hit. I don't feel good. I feel really bad right now. I don't feel happy. All right, so that's-- first the damage. That's 26 points of piercing damage. Plus he has to make a constitution saving throw against a DC of 19. Reloading, taking another shot. I don't care, I don't care. Same thing, sharpshooter, I'm going to-- I hate this music you're playing. No no. I'm going to drop a grit for advantage, because-- Deadeye with sharpshooter. That's good. It can only go up from there. And we do, all right. That's 19, 26 to hit, that hits. Oh, yeah, no, that's with the minus five, how about that, I rolled a 19. Asshole, asshole, that's better. That is a seven. So that's 17, 18, 19, 20. 30. 36 points of damage. 18. And that's my two shots so I'm not reloaded. Shot, reloaded, shot. I'm now going to burn my action surge. Can I-- I was going to say, can I burn that as a run or can I only burn that as an attack? I'm going to use my action as a dash to, oh fuck, there's no way around, is there? Fuck it, then, I'm taking another shot. This is sharpshooter as well, no deadeye. 23 to hit. I want to save some grit for some problems. (raspberry) Yeah it is. Oh fuck, yeah, thank you! That's the wrong one. Oh, that's so much better. I can't count, my brain. 32 points of damage? 32 points of damage. And a reload. We were at the Ren Faire, to be fair. Vegan. Sorry. Are they on fire now too? It flies over objects, too. And isn't this guy technically flanked by enemies now? All that I have and more. Oh no, it doesn't fuck around. This is how we all feel watching you fight, by the way. Wait, was he holding a weapon? I thought someone brought him his weapon. But I thought he was hold--I'm trying, yeah, no, I'm desperately trying to give a reason why this couldn't work. Praise Sarenrae, praise Sarenrae. Died happy. Don't make that face. Are they not going to attack him as well? I'm going to pull my magic shield, actually, I would have to have a 24 AC for that not to hit. Yeah, no, I'm-- I know. Yeah you do, buddy. Watch next week as we fail to open the door to his house for an hour and a half. Yeah, he was pretty low. We're hunting another dragon. I'm going to sit and fix my gun. I speak Celestial. Can I assist? I would like to come over and start listening to the chanting that she's doing in Celestial and harmonize and bring a voice to it since I can actually speak Celestial. 21. Take it, take it! Six years of Celestial, and when are you ever going to use it? It finally pays off. That was lovely, thank you. I'm going to fix my gun. Just barely. By one point. Did not break. We have a house to procure some items from. And a conversation to have with Zanror at some point. These two? Is it Lord Zanror, by the way? I may request an audience with Lord Zanror at some point. With your supervision. And a unique opportunity to maybe really fuck up a dragon. If we want to be smart. Hm? We have a dragon who's going to go pick up a giant package of whatever we give him. We could make some interesting decisions on what's in that box. What I do, where he can take an extra action. That's sexy. Well, we had that whole long walk. That was the theory. I was about to be toast. Two more hits from that guy and that would've been the end of me. And the code is "criticalrole", not "critrole". I got Loot Crate for my little brother. It's his nerd of the month club. Also, anything I don't want, I put into a big bin and, at Christmas, I am Santa Claus to all the kids on the block. It's intense. They all want to know what's up with me.
