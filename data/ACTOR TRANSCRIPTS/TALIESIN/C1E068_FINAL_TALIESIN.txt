No notes! Flying without a net! Is that actually a real movie? Let's make a poll. That was slightly less awkward than a real Segway. It feels like it went away. Except for the ones who come on our show. He has great shirts. Casts just smell like you after a while. I've got mine for a Disney trip later this week. That's real close. I was also on the beach. I want to check the boat. New die. I got an eight. I tousle the blanket aside. What pack? Is there a pack in the bag? I'm not at my best. I legitimately have no idea. Turns into stone, it's deep-battered, covered in cheese. Scanlan, I may borrow you for a second. I have an earpiece, damn it! When you get a moment, we could use you for a second down here. When you have a moment. He says he sees three things. Nurture check. I'm going to flip one of the boats over as a shield and hide behind it. Hey! I don't quite know what to do. I legitimately have no idea what's about to happen, because-- 22. That's the same as me! It's going to mock my cover, isn't it? Okay, this is not a ranged attack on any level, I can't counter because it's not a ranged attack. Okay! This is just going to suck. Ah! Well, that's nice. 20. Yeah, it can't fly too far. 13 points? Okay. That's 89. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm doing math, which is apparently really difficult. It's been a day. Okay, out of desperation, having no possible idea of what else to do, I'm going to try and shoot at bits of it to see if I can dislodge anything? I don't know, trying to shatter some of the glass? And yell bloody murder? I'll take a standard shot to begin with. For the moment, I'm going to stay where I am. Well actually, I'm too close to get a decent shot, aren't I? All right, I'm going to back off about ten feet? Yep! I want to be about waist-deep, if I can. I'll move five more feet-- Yep. That's fine. My AC is 18. (sighs) It's reminding me of something that happened this week. Okay, I'm going to take a-- blender of glass. It's a whole thing. I'm going to take a shot at it to see if it does anything? I know. We never talk anymore. That's 23 to hit? All right, let's see what happens with-- I'm trying to shoot a whirlwind. I don't know if this is actually going to do anything. I'm not feeling very hopeful. Nine points of piercing damage? Huh. I assume none of my Trick Shot stuff is going to use-- that thing's weird. Okay! I'm going to take a couple shots, see what happens. I'm going to do a Sharpshooter shot. That's another 23. Yeah, that was a much better roll. So that's 24 points of damage. I'm going to take a third shot. And here we go. With the same Sharpshooter. 21. Ooh, that's nice! 25 points of damage. It was a very good shot. And I'm now going to call over the earpiece everyone back! Giant flying glass wind, oh god! And I'm going to take a deep breath-- that's actually what I said. I'm going to take a deep breath and I'm going to dive underwater. Put my gun away and dive underwater. That's cool. You'll be fine. Would I get caught in that? It's also water. I honestly am just looking for an excuse to hit the glove. I'm happy to take the damage. Awesome possum. He says he can't hear you over the comm. (sing to the tune of "Fly Like An Eagle") Yeah. It's like you've weaponized a CVS auto-door basically. Is it technically grappled? Would that actually--? Okay, fine. In theory, if there's a storm, you go underwater. I am absolutely sure dragons are real; I've killed two of them. That's fine. Oh, that hits. Oh wow. Yeah, that somehow just barely hits. 112. I am not doing well, but I am alive. Pain and lack of hit points. I also assume it gets an attack of opportunity on me if I leave its radius. Of course it does. It can break away from the wall, it just can't pass through it. Okay. The first thing I'm going to do is burn a bonus heal. I've got a heal that I can do, so I'm going to heal myself a little bit so I'm not quite as close to death. Let's add 12 points. That's nice. Slightly better than before. Oh, bugger. I'm going to pull my sword and, technically speaking, I'm perfectly fine to just hack and slash on this thing right now, right? I stand up using half my movement and start slashing at it like nobody's business. It is a magical sword. Thank you for reminding me. I'm going to roll three at a time to make life a little easier. That's 21, 22, and 23. I do. You know why I hit easily? Because I do very little actual damage. It doesn't count as a dragon, does it? Oh, look at that! Yep! 13. I rolled six, six, six. Roll of the beast. That's 39 points of damage. Has anyone seen this terrible movie called "Rob Roy?" Okay. I'm going to start conducting it and spinning, slashing, and then dropping it to the bloody ground. I'm going to slowly start making my way, with great determination and not particularly much speed, I'm going to hobble my way toward the next one of those bastards. I'm calling it futzed. You need some d8s or you cool? We haven't leveled up yet. We're still hanging at 14. Let's take a look at the Wind Wall. You are definitely. You are practically my textbook definition of a gaseous creature. Muppet Liam. Dueling dictionaries. Mine's been rocking. I don't know what your problem is. How far away is it? God, I'm going to pull out the gun and start laying waste to it. I'm going to reload and take two shots with Sharpshooter. Oh no, now that jinxes it. See, that's better. Look at that. That's lovely. 26 and 23. 46 points of piercing damage. Yes. There were two shots with Sharpshooter, which is a base of 16 times two, so that's 32, plus I rolled a ten on that, which pushes it to 42 plus a four, so 46. That was for you. Now I feel guilty. Natural one! I'm cleaning my gun. I'm not even looking. Thank you. Okay. I'm putting this away and not thinking about this for a little while. I believe that was for Bad-- no, it's the pepperbox, I believe. Scanlan, can you use your very, very delicate sword and put some very, very gentle difficult-to-see holes in both of these boats? That was not what I had in mind! Straight, delicate stabbing. Did we actually end up searching the boats for everything, or did we not end up searching the boats for everything? Does anyone else want to take a short rest? Where's she going? All right. You want to keep the dog for later, don't you? That would be lovely. I'm bleeding over everything. That is so kind of you to say. Oh, thank you. Ow. That's nine. Nine is good. I'm a little better. Thank you. It's a spyglass, I assume. Yes, here. You can look through and you can see that everything is very far away. Just like you. Thank you. I think that's a good idea. I do. It's not quite as powerful as that, although that is an interesting idea. I might play with that later. That'll do. I'm examining one of the red rocks. Does it look like anything? The red circle spheres. Probably. Well, he was, because he was starting a spell. We should spread them out. Everyone should not have-- You'd need one, and someone else take the other. Let the twins have them, because they're the ones who will get separated. It's a way to call for help, Grog. I don't think you're going to need it very often. I'm going to follow. He's got the right idea. I'm going. I just had this weird thought. Do I smell anything? Do I taste anything in the air? Is there minerals? I had this horrifying notion. Are there signs that this island has even been vaguely inhabited at all, recently? How many people does it feel like are here? See if you're going where I'm going on this. 12 straight. I'm going to keep my senses aware as possible for the signs of a mining operation. And you find it. 14. Ten. (quietly) We can stage whisper. Then I suppose it would be Grog, me, and Keyleth, maybe? You going to see anything other than me, really? I'm like the city lights of Los Angeles. I'm such a wannabe. (shushes) (whispering) I say we put her down-- (quietly) I say we put her down as quickly-- that's right, we have to stage whisper. This is fine. Let's all assume that everyone cannot hear us. (quietly) We don't. She's probably immune to magic. We're going to have to take it right now! She might not be catchable. (whispering) She probably can't. Magic one of the others. I'm going to-- I'm going to create a distraction. When the distraction happens, we all charge and attack. I'll shoot her. I have a very good distraction. No. She'll know I'm here when she feels a bullet hit her. I was going to make the treasure chest look like a trap triggered. I was going to have it explode with an illusionary poison. That's fair. Magic users, try and chase the others off. See if they'll back off. We've got to get that box away from them. Yes? I can't move it. Just a little-- I'm going to make my way to the tree line and get ready. I'm going to make my way to a tree line sitting down. I'm going to try and get a nice clear shot the minute that I see anything happen. It does. Nails and screws! [break] Where are they and the box right now? I'm going to stay in the brush, but I want to get forward enough to get a clear shot so I can really take a nice, well-aimed shot at Ripley's head. I've got some nice distance. I'm going to cast Hex on her with my bonus. I'm going to hold my action. I'm going to train, and I'm going to shout from the woods step away from the box and tell your men to put their weapons down, and we will listen. It's a Hold Person. Stop moving! Put the crate down or I'll shoot out your ankle. Put it down right where it is. If I see a twitch, I fire. You can talk. You have however long I choose to give you. Explain to us why we shouldn't kill you now and let your two friends wander off into the sunset, not to be touched by us if they turn and run. Vax, keep an eye out. Make sure that there are not people in the jungle coming this way. I am in agreement that on that level, all debts are settled and fair. However, I believe we have some previous debts to still settle. You are so dull! You two really follow her? Are you idiots? 12. Hey! Anything we should know before we continue? What's she paying you? I bet I could double it. Attack her right now, and we'll discuss terms. I'm not actually sure I could double it, but I could definitely make it worth your while right now. It would be hilarious. She's awful! Oh, are they moving behind you? Do you know? You can't see. They really don't like you. Do they know what you did to my family? Do they have any idea what you do to the people that you stay with? How many have you sold? (sighs) Well, I guess I'll have to live with that. I open fire. I'm going to do a-- she really pissed me off. I'm so sorry. Okay. I'm going to spend a deadeye shot on this, which is a Bad News shot with a deadeye with the Hex. By the way, she is at disadvantage on strength checks. The Hex is probably not going to do a damn thing. I don't even know why I bothered. Magic fucking cloak. With Sharpshooter. I am so nervous. Natural fucking 20. LAURA and Did the Hex actually take, then? Wouldn't I have noticed? 17. It's been doing fine for me. Although I will admit, I rolled gold for this roll. Yes, I did. 30. I just rolled a natural 20 on my initiative. It is 30. Has she actually been hit by the Hex, by the way? That's fine. What do I roll for concentration, again? My hate lives. Oh man, that felt good. Okay. Where was I? I'm going to stand up. That's fine. What's the distance? Is it only Bad News distance, or am I within 400? So I can actually put Bad News away and actually deal with this? They probably all have much higher-- they're going to have initiative up the wazoo, so I'm going to-- okay, no. I'm going to pull the big gun out again, give it a reload and give it a shot right at Ripley. I've got the Hex on her. Let's pick a fun disadvantage. Let's see. Let's give her a dexterity disadvantage. All right. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to do a standard shot at her with a leg shot. I'm going to try and knock her prone. No Sharpshooter. That's 26 to hit. She has to make a strength saving throw. Against a DC of 19. Make sure I'm rolling all the right dice. That'll do. That's six plus ten. 22 points of damage plus three points of necrotic damage. That's funny. I'm going to burn an action surge and I'm going to shoot her two more times because it's funny. Where is she? What's behind her? I'm going to hit her again with an attempt to knock her down; I'm going to burn another grit for that. That is 32 to hit. Not quite as good. 14 points of damage, plus three points of necrotic. Another strength check. Just for fun-- no, then that's just her bonus action for that, although that would be pretty funny. I'm going to hit her one more time with a Sharpshooter shot. Do I get a bonus to hit her because she's on the ground, or no? Even with Sharpshooter? Even with standard Sharpshooter bonus of ignore three-quarter cover? So the full range Sharpshooter ignore three-quarter cover would not cancel that out? The whole theory being that it's easier to hit smaller targets. That's okay. She's down. What am I going to do? I'm not even going to pretend. I'll burn a point of grit to also ignore that. That's probably not going to hit. Let's see. 14. I throw my gun behind on my shoulder, and I'm going to head to my right to try to get some cover with that tree. Yeah, around Keyleth. Yes. Thank you for watching Critical Role. Brought to you by poor decisions. I should mention, I suppose, that these rifles are probably very breakable. Wouldn't a roll of a one with a rifle misfire? One more player off the board. I'm not at full, but I'm much better. You're probably down next to me with some cover, though. Probably not up. Kill her. You take your action to cry? Oh god. We'll send him out. They are the Hong Kong Cavaliers still at the ready. Good. That's funny. You are a beautiful person. Oh, look, they made little caskets for all of our figures. No, but good enough. 18. Is it too late to reroll that? No, no better. I would have been dead! Stop making that face. It can't kill me. 15? That's fine. I'm still fine, thanks to you. So that's halved again. Those were bad numbers. In theory, I'm able to sense my Hex. I'm not sensing my Hex? Not at all? That's fine. There's really no point of even moving, at this point. I'm just on fire. I'm going to pull out the Retort pistol, and I'm going to shoot that wizard in the chest with some fun. I'm going take three shots at him. The first is a Sharpshooter shot. That's 27. With the minus. I rolled really well. 24 to hit, I'm sorry. Actually, it's 27. I'm really angry right now. I'm genuinely angry. I can't even roll. Should I count that or not? Should I reroll it? That's 26 points of piercing damage. What the hell?! I am so calm, doing this. I'm going to shoot again, same thing. That's 12. I'm going to burn a grit and I'm going to do a torso shot, because that'll be funny. No Sharpshooter. I am. It is hilariously funny as possible. Oh, and there's no save for this, it's just if I hit. Come on, be cool. That's cool enough. 21. I'm going to use my bonus to have a greater potion. That's 4d4 plus four? And then I'm going to make sure that I look the wizard in the eye, and I'm going to yell to him You're not leaving here alive! You're going to die. As I reload. Well, I can't reload yet, but I'll reload in a second. Turn him into paste, please. If he tries to run, you'll kill him, anyway. You can only do it once per round. Yes, she does. I don't. Although I do have cover. I don't have full cover. I have some cover. That'll hit. Adds five to my AC, currently? That also hits. That's funny and useless, but okay. 14 points total? All right. I'm going to try and slow it down with a catch. So I'm going to try and lower that 18. Ooh! I lower it by 14 points. So four points of damage plus four psychic. They don't move that fast. (laughs) I'm going to be laughing my ass off for a minute. Yes. That is a thing. No, I very rarely use it because it's a bad-- I can do a quintuple. But you forgot. Goddamn it. Okay, are we rolling that? All right, nine additional points of necrotic? Oh god, I just saw it. What a lovely number. Roll them again. That was five. And does he get flung? We don't actually know where Ripley is. Can he not do anything while he's in there? Well, then we'd know where she is. She's got cover, by the way. It's a tree and a bear. Where? You can totally do the Point Break mid-air combat. Isn't Point Break the one where they keep jumping out of airplanes? I can never remember. Does that mean he can't fire his gun for as long as the spell is up? Good to know. His options are pretty limited, if I recall. Is it going to be able to hit her? There is no way that the guy who's currently got a knife stuck in her isn't going to get some of this. Just asking. It's okay. There are options. That is a series of poor life choices. Oh, shit. (high-pitched) He's not going to get hit because he's touching her at the time that she gets hit? Oh, shit. This is about to get very bad. Oh thank god. It's about to happen. 23. 38? 28? 29. Hold on, I've got to do some math. Oh my god. No, I'm good. I'm good. Okay, okay. She has to go over and pick him up. It's already taken some hits. With your eyes closed! He is made of stone. Mine are almost in the singles. Okay. First thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to-- This is such a bad experience on every conceivable level. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to run up to that jerk with the knives and I am going to press my left hand with great authority, especially considering I've just taken another bolt of intense electricity, and I am going to Iron Man the living-- on the head. I'm going to just do it. I am going to use Diplomacy for the first-- This is the second time we have ever used Diplomacy. I actually have no idea how to roll for an attack for this. I have no idea how it works, so I can roll and tell you what I roll. That's embarrassing. Okay. I just rolled. And unless you've got something to add to that, because that is a sad number that you just threw at me. Okay, because it's touch. I don't actually have to put any-- It's a 22 is what I rolled. I am horrified by what's going on. 16. But my strength is a one, so I'm horrified. Okay. Oh, god. Technically, if it's one long rest, I may be at three charges. Two or three charges. Okay, that'll do. Ten points. Oh, for that? 11. That's fine. He's stunned? Okay. Am I close enough-- in theory, I wanted to be touching distance to Keyleth? Can I use a bonus to feed her a potion, or is that a full action? (high voice) All right, next round. Okay, that's fine. For the rest of my action, I'm going to, after that, two slashes with the sword to finish it up, and then hop down. Do I have advantage because he's fucked at the moment? Okay, so let's do two little slashes. Natural 20! Oh. Because he's stunned. Oh, and so I'm going to roll crit damage. That's funny. I'm going to whale on this fucking kid, because no, we do not have time for niceties. So that's 4d8. Maybe. (counting) Yeah. 34 points of damage. No, that's 34 total. I'm going to then hop down next to her and on that side of her so that I can deal with that. Thank you. Can I pop in a bonus action? I meant to take a potion anyway. For myself. Thank you. What's a regular at? Thank you. I'm having a heart attack right now. Nope. She should write a book. She's got a broken gun right now. Can she repair on a bonus? It's an action. It's a full action to repair. An action to repair. Ha! (laughter) But she can't fire unless she has a-- Fuck! I shouldn't have even said my god damn-- god damn it! All right. This is meant to punish me for everything I've ever done. I'm well aware that this is punishment. God damn it. That's a 25? I am still ducking behind the tree, but that still hits. That's too much math happening over here. How many? 25 points of piercing damage? I'm going to have to try and catch that because it's going to fucking knock me out, so I'm going to attempt to snare that bullet. It snares all ranged. I can do it once a round. Yeah, it's a reaction. (groan of frustration) I snare eight points of damage off of that, so that's-- how many points is that? I'm not going to fall. Wait, uh. Necklace? Okay. I'm happy either way. Shit. Okay, just checking. That's fine. Shit. Okay. I am unconscious. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Is it his turn next? God damn it. Take it. Currently, I do have some AC because I have some cover. I don't know why I'm arguing with this, because I'm amused by this entire process at the moment. My grit doesn't restore from-- none of my stuff restores from death, does it? I am desperate, because we are still so fucked! You have a success! Anything would be helpful right now. Oh good, you're awake. I look at our little friend up there. I get up a bit. I look at him. Just run! I pull out my gun and I take the two shots, with the reload that I'm allotted, at Ripley. So, oh thank god it's the Retort pistol, because that would have been really poor. That's a 29 to hit, and 15. Okay, that's fine. That's 13 points of piercing damage. I doubt he'll do well without her! I try and take cover. I'm going to pull as much cover as I possibly can and take a defensive stance. Oh, and I'm going to slug a healing potion for my bonus, thank you. I meant to do that, I was literally thinking that. That's the greater, which is 4d4 plus four. Yeah, go on, I'm fine. I've got so much coffee in me. Okay, I'm, yeah, that's so sad. All right. Ripley! Literally attacking the darkness. This is what DND is all about. He might laugh off necrotic. She gets to heal. Can she make a ranged attack while she's-- I feel like I'm learning things here. She's out of grit. I've had to deal with this shit so much. That does not-- oh, do I still have some cover? With the cover, does not hit. Yes, it does. I had that coming. Has she not lost her-- is the psychic damage attached? Oh, a thing I don't know, so it's just a thing. I'm going to try and catch it, so we'll see how that goes. I'm trying to find the die for that, which seems to have vanished. There we are. 17 points? All right, let's see what this does. Okay, so that's down to nine points. Okay. So is it 17 total? Okay, so that's nine plus four, so that's 13 points. I am still standing. I am Rasputin here. This is getting ugly. That hits. Oh yeah, no, I'm out again. But she's out of shots. But she ran her full movement, didn't she? Oh, this is getting uncomfortable! I'm sorry my issues have guns. God fucking damn it. Has anyone else ever been to a horse tranquilizer party? Because it's like that. And Epipen! Except you can't afford to do them anymore, sadly. I'm awake again. I was, but now I am awake. A moon shadow. I'm aware. Aren't we always? I'm rerolling that. Seven. With disadvantage? Wow, this is here to hurt me. Let's pistol shot with disadvantage. Three, so 16. Misses! Oh my god. I'm going to climb. Can I stand up and climb on top of the-- he doesn't have an attack of opportunity against me. Where he is right now? I'm going to stand up, and I'm going to ignore him. I'm going to hold my attack until I see her. The second I see her, I'm going to attack. Then as a fucking bonus action, I'm going to drink my last potion. A regular. You can hold your attack until she appears again. The returning was inside you all along. Sharpshooter shot, Retort. Misses. 12. Sharpshooter shot, Retort. 20. (sighs) That's all I got, because I burned a shot attacking Keyleth, so I have to reload. (sighs) Yeah, I'm going to stare at her and the best thing I'm going to do is No matter what today, I forgive you, but I cannot let you leave. And I'm going to sit and reload. Bless you. Scanlan for the win. How can she still do that? Oh shit, I burned that trying to make that thing. No, I decided not to back away. Heal. No, wait, something. The wine was a poor choice. It was a good wine, but it was a poor choice. Until we hold and we wait for her to appear again, which she will inevitably will. Sadly. That's fair. That's two moo jokes, I might add. Attacks of opportunity? Vax ran to the bathroom. Also, doesn't technically the young squire get an attack of opportunity? I trust you. I hope he kills Orthax and isn't even here. 18 plus nine to hit?! Wow, does that hit. That's crazy! That's a 23 to hit. Of course that hits, as well! Just unconscious again. You stealthed that hard. I'm out again. It's a slash attack? All right. 21 points. It's a crit within five feet? Ten. I don't remember! Guys, let me say I have the coolest character lined up, but okay. This will kill me, by the way. Everything you've got. No, he can't really do it. MARISHA and Wow. Am I the first one to go? I'm prone, and I'm in shadow. With Cutting Words? Roll a d10! Well, no. Do I still have my cover bonus? It is a giant mess in there. So you have to roll a ten. This is adorable. I'm not unconscious. Technically speaking, that's three. Can you do something about this? This is necessary at the moment. Do you have nothing? Can you do something with that? Okay, never mind, then. I'm not looking. I don't want to look. I'm okay with this. I think Percy would like that. I think that's very appropriate. As the person who is sitting here, I think that we will see you next week. It is time. No, I need to process. Pick this up later. Yeah. Let's stop this conversation for now. We'll have more of this conversation later. I will not have this conversation online, either, guys. Sorry. He'll be getting a mohawk. Thank you. We'll have this talk later. It's okay, honey. Thank you, Matt.
