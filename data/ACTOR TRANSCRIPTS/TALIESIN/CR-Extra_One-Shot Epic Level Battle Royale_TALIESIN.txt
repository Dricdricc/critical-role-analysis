What episode is this?! How many episodes did it take to finally get to this? We have steamed the shark. Did podcast get updated, or did that not happen? It may not have. Comic book issue three is available. It's beautiful. And there's now two playlists out because I didn't announce my playlist last week. Percy's playlist went out and now there's a Vex podcast. I would like to know what kind of death metal you're into. Yeah, I was about to say, it was probably the boiler room because that's where shit goes and vanishes. We are kind of a mess on occasion, this is true. It's Sams all the way down. Let him paint his picture. The only thing I can think to do is I would want to already have my Boots of Spider Climbing activated and my Diplomacy charged. We get to pose before the battle right? Find out the hard way. 24. He may have to burn another luck. Wow, it's been a while. I'm going to run into this room and I want to see what's inside this building. All right. 23. I'm going to spend the rest of my action moving into the archway of mist. Yeah. How much movement do I have left? All right. Mm-hmm. You don't see me. Do you have a thingy for that? I have a cake. That'll do. Constitution saving throw. This is magical, isn't it? So I get advantage on this. What's your spell DC? Oh, okay, constitution saving throw. 25. How much damage? I'll take 16 points of radiant damage. I'm going to hop right back through that door, and take a right out that door and start heading back out that-- yeah, right there, and then I'm going to use the rest of my-- to cast Silence. I'm casting my silence ball, I am now completely quiet. That's as far as you can go. Five, ten, 15, 20, 25. To the door. Five, ten, 15, 20, 25! I would hope so. Can I say, Woo, that was close! Do I hear myself? Damn it! Fuck! TRAVIS and Well, that makes life a little more complicated. But he becomes visible, right? I have lost two of my most powerful weapons already in one round. Damn. It's okay, but I've lost two of my most powerful weapons already. Shit. I lost my Spider Climbing and I lost my Silence. Man, okay. I have 30 bits of movement. I'm irritated. Can I make it to that door? No, I can't make it to the door in one round, can I. I'm going to-- shit, this is awkward. I've seen what those things do already and I know they're about to do it again. There is nothing good I can do. I'm going to start making my way over here and try and make it to against, not quite to the door, but to the wall. Yeah, I want to be one over. Because I know that thing's got a radiant kick. And then for my action-- Okay, I'm going to spend the rest of my movement, then-- oh fuck, there is no good thing. That door is locked, I'm sure it is. Well I have an action still. Since I'm here, I'm actually going to take a few potshots at Keyleth for fun. I'm using Bad News because the distance. First shot is-- I'm actually going to do a deadeye shot to gain advantage. Actually, that's not fun. Yeah, deadeye to gain advantage. Here we go for that. And that crits! So I'm going to use that crit. I'm also going to drop all of Cabal's Ruin, the entire run of Cabal's Ruin into that. Cabal's Ruin is best used early. He knows why. Actually, that's technically, those are not d12s. These are d12s. I really should have four of these, but I'll do two and remember to-- I have to double all these dice, so here we go. Time to be a real jerk. Would that have emptied it? Okay, that's fine. That's 27 points of damage. Whole theory of that was to throw Cabal into that. That is irritating. I'm going to use one of those attacks to reload. All right, and then I'm going to take another shot and reload. This will be third and fourth attack, shot and reload. At Grog! Because that was disappointing. And I'm going to do a push-back because I'm curious to see what happens when he-- I think that'll almost get him to hit the edge. So let's see what ten feet does to him. Yeah. I'm just curious. You're near the edge, sorry. Nothing personal. That's 28 to hit. Oh, that's not bad at all. You're fine. That's 15 points of damage and you move ten feet away from me. Irresistible Dance. It might be in the new book. All of us have taken a little. That will do. I'm going to run around to the door. I'm going to snap. All right. Is the door open or is the door not open? I'm going to use Animus to open the lock. Don't fuck me, that's 29 to hit. I assume the door cannot take psychic damage. 17 damage to the lock. I'm going to run in, shut the door. It's going to be an action to open that chest, isn't it? Okay. I'm going to hide behind the door, so if it opens. I'm just being careful. I'm not going to be a brass dragon! I'm going to be me. Have you seen his office? It's basically brass dragons. We can't hear you. But I certainly can't hear him. I can't hear anything you say. It's like a rollercoaster where you know that they haven't finished the last ten feet of track. You still have movement and a bonus action. So I'm going to open that chest. Thank you. And that's how many feet? That's like five. So I can now, I have a little bit of movement to leave. Ten, 15, 20. So I can at least use 20 to get to that corner there. Yeah, toward me. There, just there. Do I see Scanlan or is he still invisible? Oh, so I see him right there? I still have ten feet of movement after that. Cool. I am going to shoot Scanlan. I'm going to shoot Scanlan. Let's use Bad News for-- actually, let's use, oh this'll be fun. Let's do Animus, sharpshooter, and deadeye, just for fun. Animus, sharpshooter, deadeye. I can't hear him. Animus, sharpshooter, dead shot. Oh, you're so lucky that didn't crit. 28 to hit. That's 1d10 plus 1d6 psychic, plus I'm going to-- eh, not on this one. This is shot number one. So that's, oh, that's terrible. I'm glad I did not. That's nine points of damage plus one point of psychic, so that's ten points of damage. For your next shot-- You take 20 points of damage because that was sharpshooter. 20, excuse me. Next shot. Same thing. Also didn't crit. You're very lucky. That also hits. That's 29 to hit and then the same thing, 1d10 plus 1d6 plus 18. 26 points of damage. And I'll do the same thing one more time. Natural 20! You've just been critted. And I'm going to drop all of Cabal's Ruin into this as well. So that's (counting) 40 points of damage and now the 10d6 lightning damage. Does that get doubled or does that stay normal? Plus 33 lightning damage on top of that. 66 lightning damage on top of that. 41 plus 66. Was it 40? 40 plus 66. 106 points of damage on that shot. Oh, I get my grit back on that, so that's nice. Ten. Cabal's empty. And for my final shot, (evil laughter). For my final shot, I'm going to reload and hide. It's going to take him so long to get to me. And if I get within ten feet of him, there's nothing he can do. I beat him up for you. So you're either going to kill him next round or he's going to do it to you. Roll that d4. I'll make it go away again. That was so pleasing. One shot! I did three shots. He's not mad at a door. That's awful. I don't feel like a good person anymore. What? Yahtzee? Even the tower? 60 feet? All right. Okay, I'm going to take this opportunity to head out of the room and I want to climb up on top of this building. Then right up to this corner right here. Actually, this corner right there. Can I see Grog? I can't see anybody. No, she's inside. I'm going to go to the center of it and if I could use my action to lay down and hide if that's possible? Okay, I'm going to lay down and, since I'm on the roof, pull down to the roof and see if I can get cover. Cover. I'm going prone and I want to keep an eye on that front door. I'm also completely silenced. Ten feet all around me are completely silenced. I'm going to keep an eye on that tower, and if I see any movement I'm going to unload an action on anything I see. I'm going to use one of my resolve. That's a save. Okay, perception. That's a 14. Yeah, let's see how well that goes. You're fine! There's nothing. Use the cake. I'm holding an action for the tower. I'm keeping an eye on the tower because that's where I'm heading next. Don't worry, I will shoot at you. Do it. I dare you. Say yes. When in doubt, say yes. What's the worst thing that can happen? Other than your spells get disenchanted. Yeah! I admire your commitment. Wow, man! Mid-game! You're asking to get fucked with! Don't call it a comeback, he's been there for years. We're aware! He is on Twitter right now. It's going to make life complicated. I've got shit I can do, but it's going to be tricky. That was foolish of you. Well, I don't know. You always have a plan. I ain't going to push it. I don't believe you. It's why Scanlan's not dead yet. I just wanted to make him desperate. I can't see anything else? No, I didn't. There's a bard over there. I'm going to take a jump onto that island. Acrobatics check. That's 24. I'm going to spend the rest of my movement running straight up that tower. I'm not entering the tower. I'm running up the tower. Sorry. My fault. And then double run. Huh. I've been having bad luck with that lately. I'm going to take cover from Scanlan right there with what's left of my movement against one of the walls. I'm backing up against the wall and that's my turn. Okay. That'll do. It did that last round. I've been keeping track. Wonderful bottle of Pellegrino for the table. No, you wouldn't have heard. Ten feet. Sorry, didn't hear it. This is why in a normal game this would be completely crippling me because anything could be happening and you could not tell me. But on a solo mission, it's pretty nice. Only a truly dumb person. This is disturbing. I don't know what to do about this. I didn't! God. I didn't see her do that, did I? I'm so fucked. Yep. This is dumb, but I'm going to do it because I don't know you're there. I'm going to walk over to that weird little door. I just feel warm. I'm going to open the door and see what's in there. All right, just because this green glow is freaking me out, I'm going to back up against the wall and then my next action later is going to be-- Have I taken any? Yeah, I've taken 16 points of damage. Okay, then I'm not going to back up out of it, I'm going to get to the back side of the hinge and I can't hold an action, obviously, because I blew my action, but I'm going to prepare to open and worry about what comes out. Yeah. With a very important message about Marvel Puzzle Quest. It's nice, it would look good on me. Oh, yeah. Bring it. And anybody in the tower. What about my Boots of Spider Climbing that are currently activated? They're activated, I ain't moving. I can't be knocked prone, you can't do shit. And then see what happens. Oh no, oh no. I have been waiting to use this Silence spell like an asshole this entire game. Purple horseshoes. O for a muse of fire! And down. And up and down. Goddamn it. Not cool! That's a constitutitution saving? Where's my constitution? There we go. 24. That ain't bad. She's got Cyclops laser until we hit her hard enough. Hey, look who you can see now! Look who you see now! Good-bye. Wow, that's a local joke right there! They're already on their way in the helicopter. I am proud of what I've done so far! I've been sniping the way I've always wanted to. I feel like such a badass right now. I know it's going to end. I'm going to shoot the lock. I'm going to get within ten feet of that lock so that there's no sound and I'm going to shoot the lock open. I'm going to use Retort for this just because I don't want to waste anything worthwhile. 30 to hit. All right. Where's my fancy--? There we are. That's ten points of damage. All right. I'm going to run inside and perch on the ceiling. I'm going to use my Spider Climb boots. And what do I see around? I don't see anything? Sure. I'm going to hide-- and those stairs keep going down? I'm going to go down to the next level. Can I see down there at all? Oh, in that case I'm not going to get that close if I can't get all the way there anyway. So I'm going to get right in that little corner there and keep an eye out. Oh yeah, I was going to say, I have to get to the other side of the fog? I don't have enough movement to get back from the fog, then? Okay, I'm going to stay in the fog and keep an eye on what's down there. Wow, you are not rolling those well. I've softened him up for you. Also, by the way, you see Scanlan as well. Yeah! Oh no, he'll survive. Wow. I don't know shit. Vibrated to death. (singing) Somewhere out there. I'm going to go the next level down, see what I see. I'm just heading down, scanning, heading down, scanning, and looking for anything. Fuck, I forgot that. I'm going to get all the way to the bottom, then, and back myself against that bottom door and I'm going to push all the way to the bottom of the tower with my movement. I was hoping there'd be a person in there. I mean, that's all my movement, isn't it? And that's all my action to move that as well, right? Yep, I ran down that tower going, I want to fight everybody! I'm of the opinion that, against the wall, I don't think he sees him right now. If you were to back off a bit, you would see him, maybe. Sorry, new earring, who's this? Thank you for being the only person who really laughed at my good joke. That was a very good joke. Chat probably liked it. And I will take it all away again next time I see him. This is such a big map! I love it! It makes me very dangerous. Sorry, my fault. Hi. You're going on an adventure! I'm going to exit out the door and I'm going to take a run back over here. This way. (counting) I don't even know if I'm actually jumping? I was actually going to walk, to be fair. MARISHA and Am I in the range of it at that point? Where's the--? I was planning on walking, but I'm fine either way. If you make a roll for it, I'll make a dex roll. It's a dex save? All right. 19? Was it not? Just for fun, let's burn-- Let's burn a resolve. It's reroll a save? I wrote it down weirdly because I was trying to conserve space. Yeah, no. Constitution saving throw. (counting) 24. I still have my action. There's no way I can use spider climb on the force wall, is there? Oh, I have to roll concentration. The silence spell. What is that? Okay, same thing. 16? This is interesting. I'm going to try and right myself and see if I can put my boots on and walk on the ceiling. That'll do. Those were such a pain in the ass. Do I fall? That was well done, Grog. I'll tell you later, but I had plans and you foiled a chunk of them. If I tell you what I'm playing next game will you just stop this? The door got exploded. Actually, I saw that. My range is there is no getting away from me. I have a minimum range of 400 feet. There is nowhere to hide. My shitty gun has a 400-foot range. No, it can't. Yet. I will make ghost bullets one day. You know what doesn't take a dexterity save? Sending to another dimension. That's fine. Constitution saving throw, let's do this. I've got a plan. I'm going to use my second resolve, or my second thing, Indomitable. Let's hope that's better. That's way better, 19. And now I'm going to try and do something stupid. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to use 25 points of my movement to run. Oh. I'm going to use my movement to run 15 feet. I'm going to try and take a running jump to the top of the tower. All right, acrobatics check. Come on, baby. That's 23. That's a much better fall than I was going to get. And then I have to do another constitution saving throw for the silence spell? Oh. 23. Natural 20. And then, so I'm 23 points in. Is it worth blowing any of this? Yeah. Am I feeling the healing? All right. I'm going to use what little I have left-- I have no more movement, even from a double-up? Using my action? I'm going to use my action for a dash to stand on the trap. Like, stand right to the trap, yeah. I stand there and I'm waiting to see what the hell is going on at this point. Yeah. Good man. Sounds pretty awesome. I'm going to head this way on the tower. (counting) Do I see Keyleth? I'm down for that. That's a terrible roll. That's 16. That doesn't matter to me. How far away is she? I'm going to do something really weird. I'm going to pull out the Iron Bands of Bilarro. I'm going to make a toss, try and nail her in the head. It's got a range of 60 feet. 30. Manners! Oh, you don't! Does it work? Damn! Fucking oh my god! That was clutch! I just saw that happen, didn't I? All right! That was really scary. That was my attack. I'm going to back off and then go back to the center of that tower and sit and try to get three-quarters cover over there. I want to stay in the green light. Oh, a wise guy? So, two squares in all around. I'm in. When we get four we actually start to remove rock blocks. She moved five feet. Remember it's two points in at this point. SAM, TALIESIN, and Oh man, we did grow up in that era, didn't we? Oh, that brought it back. The one Scanlan was next to? I'm going to get up right over here. I'm getting up over here on this point of the tower and I'm holding my action until I see even the slightest fucking little black feather appear anywhere on this field and I'm going to lay goddamn waste. Wow. I mean he had to get clutch, didn't he? That's changed things, hasn't it? You're still a player. She's now just a barbarian. No. She can't unshift. I was just inside, over here. I'm keeping an eye out. 18. That's fine. This means I get to take my attacks. That's fine. How much? That's fine. 25 hits. Yeah. Like 23. I was going to use Animus. I can do real attacks because this is my real-- This is sharpshooter. No, he's hard to hit the first time. Cool. Sharpshooter. Sharpshooter plus I'm going to do deadeye because I really want to hit this. That crits. 19. Three. Can you do that? The first attack just misses? He can just negate it. I don't get my grit back, then? I already marked it, it's fine. Let's do that again. Let's twist again like we did last summer. That's a 26 to hit. 1d10 plus 1d6 psychic, which is three, four, five. Where's my brain? That's 23 points. My third hit. Here we go. I'm spending another grit. Yeah, it'll be no fun. No, I'm not going to spend another grit. Still sharpshooter. That's 23 to hit. I'm rolling so poorly. 20 points of damage, plus five psychic, so 25. I can't spend an action surge in this round, can I? On a held action. I'm going to use Thunderwave instead of shooting. That's fair. I would have done that at the beginning if I would have thought about it. Same thing. 15, so that hits. 26 to hit. That's 24 points of damage. Oh, I have to roll to see if I keep my spell. Con save. 25. 25. Bigby's Hand is not a beast. Yeah, I forgot to bleed you. Damn. It's okay. I assume, because he's got five billion feet of range, that he is long gone? Cool. I'm going to shift to the other side of the tower, stay in the healing range, and hold my goddamn-- I'm going to run over here, stay in the little green light, hold my fucking action until I see feather. I'm up and ready. And do I heal, since I'm in the green? In that case, I'll use my bonus action to down a healing potion. Does he have to be able to talk in order to do that? (singing) My only friend, the end. Bless you. Yeah! All right. I can't use any of my held action to run, because that was not my intention. Regardless, my reaction will be to run away from where it's falling. Shoes. Yeah, I'm holding on for dear life. Okay, so I wouldn't try and dodge? I don't get a dodge for any of that? Oh, I mean, I didn't know the situation. I was just trying to be safe. Oh yeah, no, no, no. Okay, sorry, yeah. I thought it was like surfing. Acrobatics check? Come on. Oh yeah! 28! 25 constitution saving throw. Do I see Vax at any point? Do I see Scanlan at any point? Okay. Can I take my shots? All right. Three. Four! Ha. First one is sharpshooter to hit. Nope. I take damage. That's a misfire. So that's four points of psychic damage to me, because I have half saved. Add that. That's 92 now, is what I'm at. And then, fuck Animus. I'm going to the Retort gun for the moment. Retort's down. I can't hear you. And I pull out my last shot. This is my last shot because I've burned everything. Yeah. And that's, come on, don't do this to me. Oh, at least it's a hit. 19. I can't hear him, but okay. It's not going to be a bad hit. 29 points of damage. Technically, I guess he could do a visual thing. Oh, it's even worse! Too late now, anyway! Yeah, I know, it's like, we might as well burn it. We're burning it. Yeah. Oh, I mean, no, that's not my turn. That was my reaction. Yeah, so it's Keyleth's turn. Sorry. I was holding my attack until I saw people. Just barely fixed my gun. Barely. And now I'm going to do an action surge. Shot number one with grit, because I'm a little nervous about this. 26. I didn't call sharpshooter, so I'm just going to call that 31 to hit. That hits. 1d10 plus 1d6. That was terrible. 11 points of damage. So I'm all out of grit now. That's nice. Attack number two is 28. Oh, that's better. 17 points of damage. Cool. I still have two attacks? I'm going to take my movement to run over to him. That's as far as I can go? That water freaks me out. I don't want to quite step in that water. Yeah, just over there. Keep me up on the little bit because I don't want Keyleth to see me, because she's scary. Okay, I would like to curl a little bit then out of her range of vision. I know. I have two more shots? All right, I'm taking a shot-- actually, unconscious, I don't get grit back? It's death I get grit back. All right, so, taking another-- but when he dies I get a grit. Oh, well then, hm. Fuck it, then. I'll hold my attacks and use my bonus action to do a heal. No, on me. Yeah, so I'm done. I'm just getting my 1d10. 22 back. So that's 194. I'm back up to 194. That's why I didn't step in it. How would he even know where I am? That hits. None of this is magic, is it? I'm going to point out, by the way, I don't think I've actually attacked you. Yeah. Just saying. No. I'm making plans. That is a question. She looks like she's about to fire a mortar into a compound. But he's on fire. I'm making a mad dash for Scanlan. I can't make a jump to see if I can get a little further across there? My strength sucks. My strength is 12. I'm going to use the rest of my action to continue to run towards Scanlan. Use an action to dash. Can I get a little further, or is that as far as I can get? I want to be on the other side of him, if that's okay. That'll do. That's my turn. I thought I had a little bit of room. Hey, look at that! No, you're killing Vax! Well done! That's my armor class. Yeah. This is probably the best use of this. I'm going to use my action surge. I'm going to hold my action, but I'm going to use my action surge. I can use an action surge instead of holding my action. Just to stab this fucker three times. 29. Here goes the second one. 29. Oh look, I get a grit back. I'm not proud of this. I'm never telling anyone. I'm like I don't know, he ran off. I am going to move out into this direction over here because I know the walls are caving in. I have 30 movement. I'm going to move right over here to start getting out of the way. Around the corner. In that case, I'll head that direction. (counting) I'm holding my action for the second I see anyone start to fuck with me. That was my action surge. I can do a lot of damage now. Just have to bet that I can plow damage. I always knew it would be the three of us. No. I just always wanted to say that. If you had gotten your hands on anybody-- And also, can I mention, isn't he still on fire? Make it harder to-- Thank you. Lead him out. Oh, thank god. Oh, hey, I got a shot! Yeah, but you wouldn't have flown up to your perch. I will take my shot. First shot. First shot, I'm burning my grit for a Sharpshooter. Going to burn my grit for a Sharpshooter in hopes of really doing some damage. 25 to hit. Here, I'm using good dice for this. Oh yeah. 28 plus six psychic, so 34 points of damage. Half of 34. Next attack. Oh, goddamn it. Animus is down. That was a 20. Bad News comes out. That's a third attack. Come on, Gil. No, it's not a crit. That's a 27 to hit. Where are my dice for that? That's 26 points of damage. I can't use a bonus to reload, can I? So I just reloaded. All right. He's low, man. I'm going to try and fix my gun with my roll. And boy that does it. Sometimes it'll really break. I'm going to make my way up on top of that tower. Yeah. A little closer. Oh, never mind. I thought it was a little further back. I'm going to try to cross the water and get back to the other side of the water again. That'll do it. Just let the two of them settle their differences. I am so excited by this. This system's a little confusing. You're doing great. He's already on fire still. You can burn him out. You're literally sitting on him. You're going to burn him. I'm a little fucked, but we'll see how this goes. It's okay. Do you have the sensory? Anytime you turn to rock, you can tell where I am, so it doesn't really matter. I'm going to drop Silence. I'm going to use my bonus action to cast. Can I see her? I'm casting Hex. I'm taking three shots from where I'm standing with Animus. Four, god, I'm just getting used to it. Four sharpshooter. Number one is 19 to hit. Oh shit, that's pretty good. That's 27 normal points of damage. Five psychic and five necrotic. Yeah. Piercing. Oh, so I don't have to break this up. This is magical damage. Shot number two. Come on, man, this is all I need. Fucking fuck fuck. I take two psychic damage as it jams. I'm jamming a lot. Shot number three is Bad News, which is not magic. 25 to hit. It's not awesome because you take half damage because it's piercing. It's 26 points of piercing damage. Plus one necrotic. I'm going to run up the tower. No, straight up the tower. Spider boots. I want to get out of the way of the fire when it finally rolls. Trying to get inside of it. And you took damage from the force field. Goddamn it. I'm going to try and fix my gun because it's the only chance I have. Oh, just barely makes it. Yep. And then, since I don't have an attack, man, there's nothing I can do. I'm going to run on the outskirts on the outside of the tower, behind, and get some cover. Yeah, on the wall. I'm literally on the wall. It won't crush next round, will it? I mean, at current rate, I'm not doing anything dumb? I mean, I would know, though, if it's been going at-- So yeah. It's not that bad. I've hit it three times already. Yep. I'm seven. That won't hit me. Thunderwave, 5th-level. Yep. From my Stone King Cincture. DC 16. 6d8? All right. Halved. (counting) 29 halved. That counts as a whole attack, doesn't it? Then I'm going to run-- I can't. She's got me. I can't even attempt to break free. I don't get to add a d6 to that of hex damage, do I? Hey, six points of necrotic. I'm still higher. Actually, no, I'm not. Never mind. I'm at 107. So yeah! One point higher. Yeah, 18. So it's 26. Technically, since I'm grappled, do I go with her? It's my turn now, right? Or no? Yeah, no, I'm into that. Two constitution saving throws. Here we go. That's a 19 and a 21. Okay, so that's 92 minus 13. 74. I'm going to try and squeeze around out of this. Oh, fine. Natural 20. I really would've liked that on a shot, but that's okay. It would have made life way easier. If I can just use my boots to squeeze off the side-- I can't try and sneak through the window? This is not how I wanted to go out. Athletics, then? Oh boy. Nope. I can't see her at all, can I? Yep. Huh. Hmm. Yeah, no, I got nothing. Breaks the wall, probably. I want to have a moment. I make one or two? It's the one thing I'm good at. Oh, not this time. Ten and 12. 24. Hail Mary. Trying to squeeze out of this. Nope. That's eight. I can't count, guys! 25. This might be the end. I'm at nothing. 18 and 11. I'm out. You hear everything I own crack. Without a spell to her name. I had the weirdest dream a month ago! I was really hoping I could burn some grit back and then do a whole bunch of damage all at once. Thank you, Marvel Puzzle Quest for sponsoring our ultimate fighting championship. That was mean. I started this game being the most clutch, powerful motherfucker on the planet and ended it like-- Confined spaces fuck gunslingers.
