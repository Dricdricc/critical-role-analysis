Read your contract. It was a free $50 coupon for Lyft. I'd like to take a look in the cave as well a little bit. Just observing the entrance to see if there's anything written, any type of language on any of the entrances or otherwise. 21. Nothing of consequence. No, that looks dark and there was a giant cosmic bear in there. I think in general it's probably best to respect anything's home on this plane of existence. I'm not feeling this one. I don't know. What can I tell you? I normally like to gamble and I'm not feeling a gamble on this one. It's just not pretty enough. It's really not pretty enough. We've already won something here. Well, yes, because we don't care if they die. Is there anybody here of reasonable intelligence who wants to stop this from happening? Just checking. (deadpan) Please, whatever you do, don't do it, my god please. If you're going to do it, have a light source. I hand a torch. Is it a bear skull? Oh, I thought they were saying this out loud. No, but I can keep very good count, though. All right. We keep taking it from her. I'll take that bet. I'll take a three-gold bet. 200 seconds. Nine. (sighing) Oh, bloody hell. No, not at all. Wait, so the candles and skulls were there, or they weren't there? The whole theory of a path is you're supposed to somewhat stay on it, I imagine. Whatever we decide right now is exactly what happened. Yes. What? Yes, of course. We camped out right before that. You are. He wants something big in the front. I'm all right with that. He's under contract, which means that there are places and things he might be able to help us with. It's worth having him. I feel like hats are almost a traditional sign of something a little iffy. Present company included, of course. Could be dangerous. We don't know actually know. It could be anything. It could be many things. You're very clever about that. Stealth. Plus ten. Advantage versus magic. Well, there you go. I'm hearing this cacophony, and I'm slowly getting up with a sigh and moving in the direction of the campsite. Slow walk. You've got time. Keyleth, can you Druidcraft some cotton? No, we're going to save them. You owe me six gold. Vex, could you go fetch a pail of water? There's nothing to be done about that. It's a campsite, correct? I'm going to start wandering until at least I have a sense of the size of it. Just the basic features of the area. Come on. That would be ten. Vex, what did it look like? The area where they are. Were there tents? Just dirt? Was there a fire pit? Single fire pit, lit. Set of drums. Violin. If we can save one, we can everybody, possibly. I haven't seen it yet. I'm going to try and get a little closer to it, gently. I have packed my ears. I'm backing up. Natural 20. I sit. I pull out Bad News and I start to get a good look. No, I'm just going to cripple you. Calm down. The instruments are noncorporeal, I believe. One way to find out. I'm going to take a shot at the violin. I haven't done this in so long. 17 to hit. The violin. 12 points of damage. 12. No. Round two. The instruments and the campsite. I think the campsite just might be a campsite. I want to try and douse the fire. Is he starting to make his way out of the camp? I'm going to shoot him in the shoulder with my Retort gun. Ooh, just barely. 16. Taking another shot. Rolling like shit. That's better. 20. Thank god. It's been so long! Where are all my dice? Just a nick. 16 points of damage. (cackles) Really? It's more of an intermission. It's a trap. It's not actually musical instruments. Have you not figured that out yet? This is quite literally the land of literalism at this point. Dozens. This is the best simulation of our old home game that I've had. I find that very reasonable. We literally have no idea what we're up against in any direction. Cute and dainty also means scary and dangerous. I feel like that went rather well. Took less than three tries to figure that out. Just have to desecrate a relic. I feel like we've desecrated relics before. How's that book going? But I also will admit, I kind of want to see the pixies. Yes, we are. I think you would look fetching in a new lined winter jacket. You're our guide. Guide us. We're supposed to go where we're going, so you're supposed to get us there. How do we get there? Garmelie, I'm so curious as to what happens if you're going to renege on our contract. I'll also say, if we are going to attack the were-creatures, it would be nice to have a little help, maybe. From the pixies. If we explain our situation, we can make a decision and either help the were-creatures or-- It will be the last word you ever say. Natural 20. I will say that from what I gather of this realm, it probably isn't enough. It'd be kicking the hornet's nest, certainly. I think they're probably hanging back a bit. I don't know if they'd want to get this close. The two of us could snipe something out. Isn't that brilliant? He's already burned the mansion. I'm a big fan of Hallucinatory Terrain. That's of course assuming that the little green rocks work here. There's an awful lot of reasons why the little red rocks wouldn't work. Natural one. No! 11. I don't think we can leave until we take care of this. We were running from the pixies. So we have to try harder. It didn't work. I feel like they're terrible communicators. This is going to be appalling. Don't. I feel like we all learned a very valuable lesson right now. Let's sit down and camp, and in the morning, we'll go and kill some pixies. I'm going to attempt to cast Minor Illusion on the other side of the wall. Just an image of myself. Is Jameson his real name or a nickname? That doesn't jive. I think we have to pick a terrible idea and stick with it until it becomes far too much for us to deal with. I propose we take a nap. Go back and deal with the pixies one way or another. You'll take first watch. She needs to rest. Sleeping. What? Yes? What? That's nice. All right. I slowly crawl out. I pull out a piece of parchment, and I write Hello, fairies. We're napping. And I put it on the tree above us and go back to sleep. All right, fine, my watch. I'll get up. I sit up and take the watch. I will take the watch, and I will make some tea with the tea set. We're about to find out, then, aren't we? I am joining you for this ridiculous tea party. I specifically did not join those conversations. Your charisma's up by two, which means-- There is tea. Would you like some tea? I am tempted to fashion the thing that I use to pour my molds into little sippy cups that can be shared. We are aware we need to have a conversation. Good morning. So we thought we would just trick them. Oh, that was him. We're on a mission, though. No, not to kill. Well, you're a bit intimidating. We are wise enough to not judge a man or woman by their size, good sir. Stop antagonizing the Grog statue. And we have a bog to destroy. There's a cancerous tree that we have been sent to destroy. Wait, no, we need that. I wouldn't advise that. I cast Hex on the main pixie. I do. It's not very nice, is it? 27. A lot, but they die quick. What's the best check to give him? I can give him disadvantage on an ability check. So wisdom or intelligence? I feel better about killing them. Just couldn't let it go. I'm so sorry. I just couldn't let it go. 27. We are some fast motherfuckers. We were trying really hard not to shoot first. Where's the one that I hexed? Do you think they're really hard to hit because they're small? Don't forget to Trinket. Is it an action? Taking a shot with Retort, with the little pistol at the fucker I've marked. Dear god almighty. 16 to hit? Shoot again. That's better. 25. Okay. It has been way too long since I've done this. It's making me a little nervous. There we are. That's 11 points of piercing damage. That's with three points of necro in there. And I'm going to take one more shot at it with-- remind me if I can do this-- deadeye with sharpshooter? All right, deadeye sharpshooter. Thank god. This is just sucking. Oh my fucking god. I miss. All right. Now I'm diving behind that tree. Bottom right. Heading that way, yeah. Did you just say "snapricot?" This is going so poorly. Assholes. You also have an inspiration die. Yeah. I'm looking at it. Yeah, advantage versus magic on his saving throw. It's on his sheet, which means he found it somewhere. A lot of good it did you. We would be getting our asses kicked by a group of werewolves right now. Trying to settle this amicably. Does that go through her? There's one on the other side of her. Okay. From my vantage point I'm going to sit down, take out Bad News, take another deadeye sharpshooter with Bad News at the big fat fucker by the tree. I don't? Can I take a step out to the left? As long as she has less than three-quarters cover, I'm okay. Okay, so I'll move to my right a little bit, then, and I will shoot that fucker that's right in front of me. Yep. Sharpshooter and with deadeye. That's a natural 20. That makes the grit go away, anyway, so nice. That actually wasn't the golden snitch. I was just feeling like they had something on me. Okay, so this is double the dice? Roll the dice, double it, and then I add everything. Lordy, this is going to be disintegration. Six, 12, 22, 28 points of damage. Yep. Yeah, I rolled really low. Flutters back up, barely? Nothing fancy, just hitting it again. That's a 23. That's better. 24 points of damage. I call out One! And back up behind the tree. Kill them all. Build a dam. Sorry. Actually, the one I killed turned him-- She's pixie dust. Going to be a beaver again. I've never seen this before. Inspire Vax. The guy! This ain't going to be no thing. It's going to be great. It's going to be beautiful. Isn't it hilarious that we all have work tomorrow? Hot and cold. To tell the tale of the death and end of Vox Machina to little people. I'll go. Do you want to go first? I'll go first. I'm going to flip around and take a shot at that jerk right there with the Retort pistol, not the Bad News. Standard shot. That's a 31 to hit. And that's 14 points of damage. I reload. I flip around the other side of the tree. Over to this side so I can get a good vantage point on that one that thinks it's hiding right over there. I use my bonus action to cast Hex on him. Yep, to carry it over. And I take a shot at him. That's 22 to hit? Ten points of damage. Three necrotic. I'm going to burn an action surge and take three more shots at it. I'm going to roll a sharpshooter for that one, as well, which is great because I rolled a two and a natural 20. That's natural 20 with sharpshooter. That also means that I lose that grit. This is going to be great. That's great. Ten, 20, 30, 36 points of damage. I'm taking two more steps, and I'm getting that next fairy that thinks he can fucking hide from me. I'm taking one more step out so I can see him. Actually, I have pretty good sight, don't I? I've got two more shots. I'm going to do the same thing with the sharpshooter deadeye combo. That's right. I can't get Hex until next round, though. 27 to hit. That's 16 points of damage. Another shot at him. Same deal. 28. Eight points of damage. I dive back around the tree, and that's the end of my turn. Here's two more d8. Roll them twice. Whoa! You're going to leave an impression in the tree. You just clapped a fairy to death. That's actually literally the opposite. There's one left. I walk over and scrape the tree. We are going to finish off the fairies. Yes, really. It did. It was all your fault, really. You were very helpful. Hit hard, repeatedly. No, you burned your lower-level spells. We're starting to be. They do that here. I guess it's the only way out of here. It's a violent world. I am abso-fucking-lutely looting this city. Are you mad? I have a dollhouse at home! There are things that are necessary! Jesus. 13. I'm taking the crystals, too. The dead crystals. I say we get to the edge, out of this forest, and then maybe call it a night. Then they trapped us! They didn't really let us out. We're tapped. We had a long day. You did. You've grown.
