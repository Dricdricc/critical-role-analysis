Right here. Critical Role. Lovely vibrant blue with a thing on the - “Turquaz.” It’s the one where you lie on your back, right? I can do that one. They're grrreat! 15. That'll do. 23. (wordless noise of approval) Goddamn it. Wow, that's the good reaction, apparently. If I have an AC of 24, Am I fine or no? I mean an AC of 24 - never mind, it hits. No, no that hits. No, actually - yeah, I can't do that, can I? Fuck. (sighing) Yeah... All right. Don't be stupid. Oh, stupid. That's a natural 1, that's what it is. Nope, that does not hit. I do keep my small pistol under my pillow. I don't have access, in theory, to the big gun, the sword, which are under the bed and that would require a thing, and I also don't have access to any of the things I could use to reload it, but I do have four shots. Okay. Where's my room? I don't have a window, do I? Yeah, I would. You've seen it. It's not that big a castle, to be honest. Is mine standing against the door? I'm going to try and shoot him through the door to see if I can blow him out of my room. Trick shot to blow him out of the room, Let's... Let's... Yeah, no, I'm not adding a sharpshooter for that, fuck that. First shot. Oh god, I'm nervous. (high pitched voice) That'll do. It's 22. Okay. Good enough. Okay and that's got an auto push, I think, or do I have to roll for push? Strength saving throw. That does... sorry. I was not prepared. I thought I was going to watch a fight. I was really prepared for that. That's 11 points of piercing damage. Once... how many squares? That's a good question. That's 10 feet directly away. I'm going to take two more shots on him. The next shot is a Sharpshooter shot. -5 to hit. Yeah, no that's a 13. Okay, final shot is - I'm using the head shot to try and blind him for a round, so... That's no sharpshooter because that sucked. That's better! 28 to hit. He needs to roll a constitution saving throw. And that's against - I just rolled so terribly... 20. It's a 19 DC, so unless that changes with my new intelligence? He just takes 7 points of damage What? No, that wasn't sharpshooter. I just did the middle one sharpshooter. I'm going to use my movement and bonus to grab at least some of the stuff that's under my bed. Some of my things and start to put myself together and steady myself and I’ll start yelling bloody murder. Intruders! Intruders! Oh. It's a nice neighborhood. There's no bars on the windows. It's a small room. Full on Wilhelm scream. (imitates Wilhelm scream) Thank you, Matt. I’m going to run out of my - I’m grabbing just the basics. Gloves and the gunbelt and my gun stuff. No armor. No amulet. Running out in the front, what do I - Okay, so fine, I’ll just have that. All right, so no armor, so. It’s this way, and do I see any, I don’t see what - Okay, I’m going to run past her room towards the west, and do I have a view right there? Okay, I’m going to take a couple - I get one foot, stop, turn around. I draw my sword and I’m just going to go stabby on the bastard because I haven’t reloaded my gun yet. Yeah. I can get there. Oh, right there? Okay. Then fine, I’ll just unload the gun. That’ll be fun. I have a fourth shot and then another one, yeah. No, sharpshooter. Oh, I do? All right, that’ll be 28 to hit. 22 points of damage. LIAM AND Taking another shot at him. Advantage? That’s okay, I still rolled really great. (all laugh) I was hoping for a critical, but whatever. 25 to hit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was... 24 points of damage. Fuck it, let’s burn an Action Surge. This’ll be funny. That’s, 16, 17, 18, 19... 25? That’s 19 points of damage? I reload. I drop a health potion and then steady to take care of that and reload my guns with the rest of my turn. Yes! 23. This is happening. This is happening. It’s either a lot or a little. I threw you a minor. It’s not much. Do those stairs go to the west tower, by the way? Cool, just checking. It's like, "I’m holding everything "until she makes a door." You can hold a dash for Keyleth’s turn. TALIESIN AND And then she moves and then you go. He’s naked. (silly voices) D&D! That’s the one that ran that way. He’s mine. Natural 20 against me? Goddamn it. Where’s my goddamn - ah, shit. I was going to try and grab it. I’m just trying to find my - my dagger seems to have vanished. Yeah, I can’t find my dagger for some reason. My gloves. I think the snare glove is 1d8. 1d10. That’s even better. Dropped to 23. Yeah. so. That’s right. No, I’m not thinking. There we go. (singing) You’ll be swell. TALIESIN, ASHLEY, AND I swear I’ll finish it eventually. I swear, I swear. It’s really just a stink-eye. It’s the eye of the tiger. Can I see that jerk who just threw the knife at me? Okay, I’m going to roll towards that corner as well. Yeah, I’m going that way. (laughs) I’m taking some shots at him. Sharpshooter. I will not hit Trinket. 24? Yeah, that’ll do it. 25 points of damage. Taking another shot. Sharpshooter. That’s 19? Hee! 24. Another shot. Yeah, no, I’m actually going to hire him. He’s been great. (laughs) I can’t count when you do that. 24. 24. Come on. 18. 6 + 10. But I get a -5 to my attack. I keep running by them right up the hill. Mine’s dead and yours is dead. We don’t know about any others. Yep. (singing) Sam has got a Counterspell. This is what it's like on this end, going, "what the fuck do I do?" Thank you. I wasn’t there. Yeah, we’ve never, we have no... It’s just the number of fingers, man. Yeah. A cup. 10 by 20? It’s not a very descriptive - I’m going to grapple that dick. (radio announcer voice) That’s called "The Rakshasa Blues." I’m going to finish running up to the West Tower. He could have joined me. I am alerting the guards and I am yelling through the hallways to lock down the city. We don’t know we got everybody - lock down, keep looking! Everyone get - I've got a plan. No no no no no! No. I’m grabbing Vex. Vax, Vex, with me. Everyone start searching. Tell them that we’re going to need a healer downstairs. And I’m going to take him. We’re going to head towards - I’m taking both of you - I have a strength of 12. There’s not a lot I can do. I’m going to try and drag him down towards the pit with the orb of death. Yes, let them know what’s going on. Just make sure if you start to feel strange as we go down there, let us know. And we slowly inch towards the effects of it. That’s so true. Yes, but your smell is. I cast - no, no, never mind. I’ll hold off. Keep walking. Okay. Very gently. If this doesn’t work, we can try something else. Don’t throw it in the orb! Put it on the ground. We’ll deal with it. We’re not leaving it here. Three things. Three things. No. Yeah, there’s no Bag of Holding in here. So why don’t we go upstairs now that it’s off and we’ll leave it here, and I’ll be the last to leave with it. Because I'm not sure destroying it in here is the best idea, and I'm not sure if destroying it is going to damage him. It's not a terrible idea, but we should - Let's just very gently - we don't know what that is yet, so let's very gently get you out of the orb's influence, and then we'll remove it out of the orb's influence, and we'll see if there's a problem. I pick up the cloak and move it outside the orb's influence to see if it has any effect. I just gingerly start to put it forward, watching him. All right. Seems all right. I think we should have someone look at it first. Or we could destroy it properly. One or the other. I am carrying the robe on Bad News like a stank rag, at this point, through the hallway. (cracks up) Anime bathhouses. Let's all meet in the sitting room in ten minutes. So let's have anybody on the Council meet there in ten minutes. I'll send word to the guards to get everybody where they need to be. If anything's out of sort, it will instantly reported to us. I'm also getting my shit. Oh. Who did get attacked, out of curiosity? What happened to yours? Did you kill him? I'm going to turn to a guard and say, "Search underneath the window of that bedroom. "Anything you find - "look carefully, find a body. If you don't find a body, find a trail." Good work. Windows are good. A rakshasa. We're looking, but none of ours. Yes. Because it came here. It may not know its value, but it does - If we can put some manpower towards discovering where he is and where he lies while we continue our search for the Vestiges, and then once we have a solid lead, we can follow it through. That's a way to go. How many of them were there? Where were they all supposed to meet when everything was finished? So I think we have 4 dead bodies. We're missing 2, then? Kashaw's? Oh. Mine, yours - LAURA AND And we're waiting for news on whether that one - Oh, yeah. I still actually have it, it occurs to me. I haven't put it down yet. I've actually been using Bad News like a - Like spindle. Like a bindle. Hobo. This was given to Vax. It was mystical. It was attached to your skin. Yes? I honestly don't know. I haven't been here. But we hunt. We are... everybody here hunts. That's a great idea. That's a brilliant idea. Yes, please. We also, I might add, in theory, have a wolf patrolling the area. And I'm sure he's aware that there's a commotion. I'm slowly - I'm going to walk in and have a moment and look Vax over. There's one last thing. And I walk up and I look you over and I pull out the raven head cloak clasp and I pin it to hold the cloak together. And it's very deep, pitted silver with a slight ruby tinge to it. And it smells FABULOUS. And it smells better the more you sweat. And it smells of the Raven Queen's temple. Now talk to Keyleth. I'm counting on you. Good luck. And I walk away. I know! You guys are going to drink for a bit? I'm going to go out past the wall and see if I can yell for the wolf. Galdrick. I’m bringing a swath from one of the - Galdrick! I show the blood-soaked chunk. There were six. Now there’s one. If you find him, we would be forever grateful. Now I’m going to go up and have a drink. I ate them, and I was fine. I can tell you what is in there. It's nothing fancy. Well, it's a cast of - the skull you gave me is still in my bag. I did. Thank you. Oh, god. Did he just throw up everywhere? Let it out. Let it out. Is there some vomit in the corner? I'm going to go poke at it just to see if there's anything in there that looks funny. I'm well-aware. I have siblings, I've seen this before. There's no signs of poisoning in any of the remains, is there? That's fine. It will take - if I don't see anything in 3 minutes - Awful people. That's a 14. Nothing, nothing, no poison. (annoyed) No. I can actually have everybody killed in their sleep. This is actually one of the perks of sleeping here. I don't even have to do it myself. I come out and I'm - (shudders) Mimosas. We hardly can make cocktails. No, this breakfast beer is perfectly reasonable. His face touched that. I'm just dipping in. Oh, god. I take one more big sip and toss it at him. Oh, it's all his. Check the body for bits and then the rest is his. It might be a gazing sphere. Be careful. Keep it under cover. Keep it wrapped in something. Good boy. Good boy. We'll stop by Gilmore's on our way back up to the front hall. And what can it see, precisely? That's disquieting. Excellent. (quietly) She's staying in Whitestone while we do our work. (louder) Thank you for keeping my home safe. Thank you. (sighs) We won't be gone long. I'd say one more proper night's sleep, then into the Feywild. We've seen what the Vestiges can be. I think they're... terribly important. And we can return from the Feywild immediately and in theory, be right back here when we're finished, and perhaps by then we'll have an avenue of attack to this rakshasa. I figure we would take one full night's sleep - We leave at dawn? We plan at dawn. We plan to leave at dawn. Right on thirty is fine, if you say 900, 930. Barring traffic. I feel that this is a skill check. No. I spent too long in high school learning how to juggle. Skill check. No! That's not how it works. (laughs) Sorry. Sorry. I have - Thank you. We have the night to sleep and we leave at dawn. What? Yes? Yes? Yes. (irritably) Do you see the giant mess in front of me right now? This is the thing for your broom. I'm sitting here while you were drinking, working on this. You will put a drink aside for me. I will see you either later tonight, if this goes very - Actually, give me the broom. Just give me the broom. I will either see you later tonight, or I will see you in the morning. This pains me. This pains me, and it must be put down. This must be put down and finished! Good night. That's a 21. It's not my first roll at it, so, yeah. That was a long walk! Wow. (snorts) Wow. (whispering) Oh, bastard. That's a 25. Proficiency, dex, and roll. I've got a wonderful little Elven signature on the bottom, which I will tell you what it says in just a little special signature, and I put it aside. I write down quick little notes for some stuff that's to be taken care of while we're away, and I go find the bloody bar that they have crashed. I'll take the broom. I hand you a broom. At the very bottom in Elven, scribed very gently with a twig, it says in Elven, "Death From Above." (yelps) It's a 214-year-old pub. Oh, god. A round for the gentleman. I was going to go take a seat next to Pike, at some point. I've got a letter for you. Oh, bloody hell, about fucking time. (sighs) You're intimidating as fuck, you know that? Yes. Everyone's always worried about impressing you. Yes, it's why we're rubbish when you're not around. Everybody's trying to impress you. I know. Believe me, I'm aware. I hand her a letter, and say, "Here's a list "of every terrible thing I've got going on in this city right now." "So you'll know what I've got cooking. "Plus some people that if you need particular things, "you can talk to in the city, who are friends of the family. "10 things to see in the city that might be nice, "and my 10 favorite books in the library, in case you get bored." Exactly. (all laugh) I'll try and keep the kids safe, and I will try not to be the thing that kills them, either. Hm? All right. I remember. I will wear them always. Okay. I will keep it on. Thank you. And please keep all this safe, as well. (sighs) Let's all be safe. To that. Cheers, and god, God, wouldn't that be lovely. Outside. Outside! Slap fight. Sleep, then leave. Sleep, then leave. Lady spas? Wow, just - All right. (sighs) I know. I plan on coming back. I'm not done. (sighs) I hate you. At your service, Lord Cassandra. (laughs) So true. (quietly) See? That wasn't so hard, was it? You could sing. Harry Potter Land! TALIESIN AND Man. Not Taliesin. It technically is tomorrow.
