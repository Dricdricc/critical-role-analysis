Help. Son! Turn down that Whitney Houston tape for a second! Whatever. Did you do your homework? Gail, are you sure D&D is safe? It scares me like rap music by Public Enemy and LL Cool J. He is trustworthy. (laughter) That was amazing. My clay pot is glowing? Five. Thank you! He's tucking. He could tuck. Ha ha! Natural 20. 25. I'm going to try and break the pot in through the cage. I'm going to take a swipe at the pot through the cage with my sword. Nine? I'm going to swing around and try to get another shot. Stop doing that! You'll get everyone drunk. Even worse. That's actually a natural one. I'm going to run towards-- I'm in combat with it. It gets an attack of opportunity if I run, doesn't it? I'm going to steady myself and prepare for another attack. Nott, deal with this! That's a number. Yeah, that hits. Hmm, that's a shitty roll. Do you get an attack of opportunity? Pots, people, pots? I'm useless on the pots. I'm actually going to try and make a book for the cloaked guy. I'm going to yelling at everyone Hit the pots! Hit the bloody pots! That's fine. That hits. Oh my god, really!? Yeah. Pots, people. I'm going to take two strikes with the radiant swords. That's a 15 to hit. An eight to hit. Okay, that's all right. Does it do extra radiant damage? I mean, because I do an extra bonus radiant damage, if it takes it. Oh, so yeah. That's (counting) 11 points of radiant damage. Six is radiant, and the rest is the sword. Doesn't he have crossbow advantage? You're going to be all right, Fjord? We're all right here. 18. I get an attack of opportunity? That hits; that's 20. That's five points of normal damage and five points of radiant damage. I want to swing and pin the heart to the ground and leave the blade there. Last pot! I'm going to run over to you and put a healing-- I don't care. I don't know any of that. That's a healing potion. I'm going to go looking for one in one second. Potion of healing, just a standard 2d4+2. So take six points of heal, you're stabilized. Back up, come on! I also, definitely lost my two swords now, so those are off. The swords are not glowing anymore. I had to feed a healing potion. I had two going, so I needed hands. You can do something, if you like. Pot! Pot! There was no heart on the ground 12. It's coming from the bookcase. Do I see this? I'm going to quickly cast before this goes-- I don't know. I'm going to cast one level-- Nope. Move the bookcase. I'm going to run over to it and start taking slices at it. I'm going to stab it with my sword. Mm-hmm. Two shots. All right. First one is 13 to hit. That's eight points of damage. I'm taking another swing. That's 17 to hit. That's five points of damage. Is there any way to get in there? I'm going to start trying to open it up. I want to go in there, look for things, and break every damn-- I use all my hit dice when I heal, because of Tough, right? There was something I got. I feel like I got that, though. Was there something else that does that? I feel like there was a thing. I'll have to keep reading. What does the mantle look like? Does it look familiar? I was hoping. What else did you get out of there? That is a good idea. Everything's in the pile? Including the stuff in the second chest? The stuff in the second chest. I heard two traps go off. Anything you take on your own time is yours. We're on the clock. We're not stealthy, doing this. Greener than normal. Or fill in the blanks. He did have feet. They were just somewhere else. I'm taking a ring. How many are there? That's fair. That was not a good deed. That is literally baseline of what's expected. I'm taking an extra one for helping you remember that you're supposed to share. You can put it in your ear. Let's keep it all together then, for now. Except for the books. Got to do business. Advantage, or no? No. That's a one. A one. Tie it up and bundle it. I wonder if you'll come out in one of the Nine Hells but only a third of you. You're welcome. There are literally going to be rock monsters if we go back the other way. Not far. We're only going an hour down, tops. Are we taking a cat? That's fair. Let's just-- Good to know. I'll join this. Is there a place to tie it off? Perception. That would have been ten, again. I'm already taking off my jacket. I'm taking off everything that I don't want to get wet, keeping just one sword, and I'm going to go for it. Weirdly, there are no nipple rings. Those things are dangerous. They catch on shit. 16. I'm going in. I'm crawling up into it, man. No, because it's going to have a flow, because the water is coming down. We have to tie it off on something. I'll let you know when I get there. Yeah. Where is it? I'm so excited. I want to hear your white noise. (laughter) I've always wanted to do this. We seem to keep finding these. I am going to examine this thing. Seven. Magic. I will pick up the skull and take a look at it. It is human? All these checks. Where's my medicine? There. 12. Very true. Well, on your way, Yorick. I set it adrift. I'm going to also keep my eyes open. I'm going to try to get a little bit down into this to see if there's any bits and pieces underwater. Do a little pat down. 18. All right. I'm going to kick my way back up to the boat. A lot of bad decisions. Several boats. Someone who didn't quite get away. I think I should find that gross, but I'm kind of into it? We did find one interesting thing a place to stash things if we don't want them to be found. Well. If we come out the other way, then we know how to get back down here. Good to know. Wet. Somewhere in the world right now, someone's laughing. That was fun. Long rest. That's a bit deep in there. I think at the top, personally. Oh, that's a whole different show. You did great. Do I believe him? One. I'm rolling so well. If you kill them, then they're not really your friends, are they? Exactly. It's probably time. 21. There was a lot in there, though. We could have strapped them both to your back. Quite a few will-o'-wisps. Quite a few traps. Was there a gelatinous cube at one point? I smack her on the back of the head. That's right! You're up. I swat. Once we've figured out that the will-o'-wisps were coming from pots we just broke anything that looked like it might contain one. A lot of images on the wall. Weird magic stuff. Possibly a probing question would remind some things. I'm trying to remember. It was a bit daunting. We'll do our humble best. Let's go pawn some things. Let's clear some things out. We didn't actually tell him about the manacles. A very dead guy. I don't see why not. You've been waiting for that for too long. Several. Specifically their feet. She's not a verbal learner. I could tell. Unless there's an opal in there, I'm getting rid of the ring. Oh, that's fine. They're probably fake, then. Anything you took from the circus was not real. It was trade. Commit to it! There's literally a cadaver that just went into the building. Not to give you ideas. I would like to try some chemical altered states. It's time to have a good night. Yeah! Probably the celebratory first night. Oh, just before dusk. I have no idea. MATT, SAM, and There's only enough for two other people to take it. Well, it's a little late, because I already took mine. I'm waiting to see what's happening. Whoever's sober, keep us out of trouble. Somehow she knows you, you always do this. I'm excited. Oh yeah. A wisdom saving throw? 15. I'm going walking. Who wants to go to a cemetery right now? I'm going to put on my least interesting cloak, and I'm going to go find myself a cemetery. We're going to work on it though. I'm going for a walk. I have no idea. This could come in handy. 18. Drink and a bathhouse? You know what just occurred to me? I didn't have a childhood. I've never said that out loud to someone before. What happened to you? I'm so proud of you. You did so well. Oh yeah, everybody, let's take a bath. Oh yeah, look at that. I don't think I've ever been there before. What's it say? We'll start a brand new text thread. I own some really nice Lederhosen. No-- were you? Oh, that's the other pair.
