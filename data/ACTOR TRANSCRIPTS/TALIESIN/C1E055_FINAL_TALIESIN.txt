I have extras, if you need some. Yeah, it was pretty cute. E3 is two weeks from now, and I'm also going to be at Amazing Comic Con Vegas two weeks from now. And Signal Boost is currently in its second week, which is hilarious, and amazing, and you should totally check it out because it's weird. Thank you. Oh. Thanks. I'm now... yeah. I'm going to die today, thank you. (laughter) Yeah. Throw her the teleport stone! I'm going to hop on an eagle. I'm going to try and clear my gun while I'm up there, too. So, situated, I'm just going to try and clear the gun and see if it's an easy fix. Nope. Gun's broken. Yeah, gun's broken. I've got another gun, but big gun's broken. Damn it. I put it away. It's 1d8 plus your dex-- You're fingering the wound. Okay! (laughter) We're not within 400 feet of it, are we? Fuck it. Taking a shot. At least taking one shot to see what happens. Ooh yeah. Natural 20. 18, that'll do. 27 to hit. Oh, and he still has-- no, I lost Hex. 14 points of damage. I'm going to spend the rest of my attack pushing the eagle down to fly at tree level. You have Hunter's Mark. I'm going to keep my eyes peeled on what I can see and try to keep up as best I can at treeline, like below. 50 feet. You're doing very well. You're doing very well. That seems like a really good use. A meteor. What's the worst that's going to happen? Is he coming to this side? Possibly. What if we take shifts with the eagles? Eagles fly a group up, fly down, pick up another group and bring them? But that's an hour with a short rest for everybody as well. So there's a short rest. He said looking pretty rough. I know. Would you like a tour of Whitestone? It's really lovely this time of year. Hopping on an eagle. It's really cute. Nope. Shale, Shale. The scouting party. Where did you find the bodies? Where were they left? 24. Absolutely not. (laughter) I feel violated, but thank you. This is going to be great! I'm on board and committed to this. This is very exciting! Just be very quiet. I'll ride the broom. I'm not a climber. Not the kind of magic you learn in ivory towers. Old rocks. Not the kind of rocks one finds in ivory towers. Whoa! Slowly! About half a minute. 30. Yeah. I'm hanging so I can drop. I'm going to drop down. I'll let go of the broom. I'm going to just fire blind where I heard the noise coming from. Yep. Disadvantage. That is a 25. Oh my god. Ten points of piercing damage. I'll take the next shot. Forget it. Might as well go for it. That's 20. Third shot for the run. Fucking-- And a one. It's not been a day for Percy. I'm going to start making a dash into the corner there, up in the-- No, I'll make a run. Yes, to the wall. Not anymore, it's not! Oh god, this is a terrible idea. I'm going to roll and hide behind that pillar behind me. If that's okay? Yeah. I've got to fix this. 21. Do I not have cover? I'm spending a Resolve because that was bullshit. Can I burn another Resolve? Goddamn it. Scanlan's got the armor. Ten. You've burned his third legendary action. You've burned it. It's gone. It just grows in lighter. Oh god! Okay, I'm going to take a second to try and pray that my second gun doesn't break because that's going to get really ugly! And it doesn't! My gun is fine. My gun is fine. But that's it. I'm going to start running straight down, as far as my legs will take me. Not that way, towards the pool. Right there. Oh no, that's the insects, that's right. So, yeah. I'm going to roll around to the stone to the right, then. As far as I can go. Oh, yes. I'm going to spend my bonus action to do a quick heal. My Second Wind. Oh, god. That was awful. That's okay. So, yeah. Good. You can move on, sorry. That halved? No, that's not halved. Sorry-- brain! Is that a 20? This and the next round are going to be really ugly. It was just hanging there! Okay. How close am I to this dragon? I'm walking right the fuck up to it. I'm pulling out the sword. And I'm going to fucking town, screaming like a little girl the entire time. With advantage. 26! All right, first damage. 23 points of damage. For shot number one. Shot number two. Natural 20. Ten, 16, 16 times two is 32. 39, that's 39 points of damage. Number three! Oh, it gets worse. I'm going to die. Okay, I can do better than that. No, he can't. 22. That's 18 points of slashing damage. Action surge, motherfucker! It is not an awesome hit, it's just a hit. I'm really excited. 18 points of damage. Shot number two. That's a hit. Natural 20. This is to make up for all these fucking ones. 47 points of damage. Final attack. Plus an action surge for a second attack set of three. So I'm basically going-- Yeah. It's just a fucking John Wu attack. Oh my god, it hit. Just barely, because it was a one, otherwise. And that final hit is-- oh, that's good. 27 points of damage, and I'm done. Fuck it, bonus action, I'm putting on the mask and standing my ground. Fuck it. Yeah, I'm done. It's okay. You're fine. You are totally fucking fine. Even if it goes, it was worth it. With advantage. I love watching him look at the phone. Do we get an attack of opportunity? 20. That would just be steam. 18. 62? Okay. I have 13 hit points. I count up. Trinket. No. It's okay. Natural 20. We have done a lot of damage to this thing. I'm going to take three shots from where I'm at. First, I'm going to use my bonus action to chug down that potion I just got. What's the superior worth? 4d4 plus four. Where are my d4s at? I'll just do this four times. 13 points up, so that's a little bit better. All right, I'm going to take shot number one. I'm going to do a called shot to the face. I'm going to hit his other eye. Come on. Natural 20. Fuck no! No, I love this die. Yeah, and I had a really bad day afterward. Let me tell you. That didn't turn out too well. That's just 16 points of damage, and I don't think I get anything bonus for this, he has to make a constitution saving throw. Or he's going to have disadvantage on all of his attacks for the next turn. Yeah, no, he's fine. I know. It was worth a shot. I'm going to take another shot. Fuck it, I'm just going to go for a sharpshooter, to try and do a little bit more damage to this, and I'm going to burn another grit and get advantage on it. So advantage sharpshooter. And that's a good thing, because that was terrible. And that was also terrible. So I miss. Yeah, third strike. Here we go. Actually, you know what, I'm going to go for advantage. I'm going to go for sharpshooter advantage one more time, just for shits and giggles. Jesus. Do I call it? So, yeah, I miss. I'm going to hide. I'm going to pull top right, and go up. I'm going up and I'm getting the fuck back there, as far back as I can get. Did I not get cover? Okay. Blowing my last reroll. That's better. Fuck no. I mean, I rolled good, but-- That's 20. I'm unconscious. I believe in you. Nope. Oh, yeah, I am very unconscious. Yeah, what am I at? Do I? We have some empty potion bottles. The one I used as well. We already looked for those. I can assist with any of the cutting, because I've got the fuck-all sword. We could just camp here for the night. You know what we can do, is we can make the magic mansion in that cave off to the side, in the very back of it. We haven't sprung the magic trap, either, so that's just none the wiser. I'll help. Forever, the Herd will just say, Grog, that asshole.
