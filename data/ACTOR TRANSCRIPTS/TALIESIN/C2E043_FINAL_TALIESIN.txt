I'm excited. 000403.750 --> 000406.098 (cheering) 000406.098 --> 000414.522 I have gained so much weight since that picture, good lord. 000422.847 --> 000425.236 Does the DM get to keep the ticket if you spend it? Is the question. 000647.827 --> 000650.480 Wih-bih-dib-n-dum. 000750.868 --> 000758.756 Oh sweet Jesus. 001435.667 --> 001437.956 Someone's getting Velcro in their stocking. 001537.572 --> 001538.659 12. 001914.672 --> 001919.108 12. 001923.216 --> 001928.161 Wow, this is a look. 002502.256 --> 002518.283 I know, it's hard to think right now. 002625.728 --> 002629.105 Okay. I just saw that we are running, apparently. 002853.882 --> 002901.153 Well, okay. Let's see. I'm going to follow Yasha, because that's apparently the way-- 002910.987 --> 002913.890 how much distance can I cover? How close to her can I get? 002913.890 --> 002917.224 Is there an easier way off or is that the easiest way off the boat? 002920.601 --> 002925.074 Oh yeah. Whichever way gets me closer to her quickly. 002933.823 --> 002935.402 I'm learning. 002937.503 --> 002942.902 Okay, I'll take that other 30 for now, then. 002949.961 --> 002955.381 Yeah, I'm going to hold there for now. 003009.837 --> 003014.570 I was going to say, they're going to hit the guard. 003716.558 --> 003719.577 20 for me. 003759.105 --> 003801.854 My heart is fucking racing right now. I am not okay. 003814.395 --> 003816.371 Did that guard take damage? 004023.301 --> 004024.228 Okay. 004025.066 --> 004035.606 My passive perception is 18. 004157.867 --> 004203.009 Is he within 30 feet of me? Wait, no! I can cast this on myself, can't I? 004213.540 --> 004214.533 Can I cast-- Let me take a look really quick if I can do this. Sentinel. Can I cast 004221.388 --> 004222.808 Sentinel on myself? 004222.808 --> 004224.997 As a reaction, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet-- 004227.108 --> 004228.066 Oh yeah! 004228.478 --> 004229.456 So none of that. 004231.158 --> 004236.508 (nervous laugh) Cool. 004256.660 --> 004301.381 I am looking irritated at the guards at this. 004310.560 --> 004318.421 Caleb is not within 30 feet of me either, is he? 004427.240 --> 004427.772 Just checking. 004428.841 --> 004434.575 I'm not even going to dignify that. 004546.854 --> 004552.246 Travis? Yes. 004553.356 --> 004554.235 He ain't going to be hitting me. 004618.625 --> 004625.146 Oh, man, wow, I am really stuck on that, aren't I? That's irritating. 005506.359 --> 005511.200 That's difficult terrain, though, so if I burn my action I'm only going to get 30 feet. 005521.979 --> 005523.839 Hmm. Let's get weird. Okay. 005525.350 --> 005527.231 I'm going to vanish. That's the first thing I'm going to do. 005548.201 --> 005551.481 There's a joke there that I cannot think of what it is because I'm too freaked out. I can 005603.163 --> 005605.902 cast while I'm invisible, correct? 005605.902 --> 005611.188 Well, the invisibility only lasts one round. 005614.230 --> 005617.392 Not a big deal. 005620.269 --> 005624.732 As long as it's not a damage spell, I can just-- 005638.342 --> 005639.864 Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll just ignore that, then. I'll stay invisible and I'm going to try and 005647.108 --> 005650.339 take my 60 feet. 005650.339 --> 005651.821 Yeah, my 30. 005652.619 --> 005700.101 Can I get one further away, just to-- 005704.022 --> 005706.281 Yeah, just to get a little cover. Thank you! 005709.750 --> 005714.391 I have never been so proud. 005749.085 --> 005753.741 Attack of opportunity? 010506.407 --> 010507.118 Fuck, man. 010554.555 --> 010603.807 Being taken to the Plank King ain't bad. 010623.733 --> 010634.815 Do they even know who the Plank King is? 010638.800 --> 010643.369 Acrobatics or athletics? Those are both terrible, okay. 010911.355 --> 010914.576 I'm a big thing. A 20 is what I rolled. I rolled a 19 plus one, so I'm going to do an 010920.643 --> 010921.732 acrobatics run. 010921.732 --> 010922.440 I am, to be fair, invisible. It's hard to grab. 010925.672 --> 010932.757 What the fuck is happening? 011030.024 --> 011034.300 You are tanking. This is a tank. This is a good tank. 011249.442 --> 011253.120 Wow. Really? Now? Really? 012114.850 --> 012118.802 So that's fine. 012137.413 --> 012138.870 This is six rounds of, "Well, that's okay." 012142.688 --> 012144.280 I'm mad as hell! And I'm not going to take it anymore! 012236.825 --> 012241.958 I Immediately turn visible. 012441.329 --> 012442.822 Hey. 012447.829 --> 012452.286 I'm going to-- Yeah. I'm just going to help my friend there. I'm not going anywhere, 012457.240 --> 012506.281 it'll be fine. I'm going to cast Bless on Nott and Yasha and can I Bless myself or can I not Bless myself? 012506.281 --> 012508.757 I can Bless myself. So I'm going to cast Bless on the three of us. 012511.214 --> 012512.665 That's a d4 to your saving throws and to your attacks. 012516.896 --> 012517.980 All your saving throws and your attacks you add a d4. 012521.738 --> 012523.515 No, it's a concentration spell, so. A little something something. 012528.468 --> 012531.250 Does it look like he's going to make an attack? Because I'm going to start scooting towards-- 012536.569 --> 012541.758 How far away is Caleb, currently? 012548.413 --> 012550.259 I'm going to point and start walking that way, just going-- Is he going to make a swing? 012602.186 --> 012604.021 Okay, I can't use a bonus action to convince him to let me walk by, can I? 012609.157 --> 012610.423 Oh, yeah. Would I know that or would I not know that? 012618.507 --> 012619.529 Okay, that's fair. All right. It's looking like he's going to hold-- 012622.978 --> 012628.359 I'm going to turn to the other side of him while not being very aggressive and I'm going to-- 012634.011 --> 012636.376 I know, but he's-- 012638.411 --> 012639.372 He needs a little bit of healing-- 012640.518 --> 012641.501 While we're having that conversation, I'm going to flip around to the other side of him 012644.576 --> 012647.159 so I'm a little further away from Yasha. The other way. 012647.159 --> 012648.323 Yeah. Keep going. There. Not quite in contact with the other-- 012652.116 --> 012653.926 I'm not going to quite bump into them, you know. 012656.138 --> 012658.581 Is there shit I can do with my bonus or is there nothing I can do with my bonus? Probably 012704.608 --> 012717.640 not. That might be everything I can do. Yeah, I'm going to cast a quick Healing Word on Yasha who 012717.640 --> 012719.705 could probably use a quick Healing Word. 012719.705 --> 012721.547 So take a little-- 012723.537 --> 012725.886 Ooh, that's nice. Take an extra nine points of healing. 012729.060 --> 012730.463 They have an official sash. 013027.324 --> 013031.917 Is he within 30 feet of me? No, not 30 feet. Goddamn it. 013236.819 --> 013246.069 What happens to her concentration spell? 013642.597 --> 013643.614 Do the guards now know that they were being manipulated? 013647.456 --> 013651.419 Still have to make a dex save from it, though. 013719.537 --> 013722.072 What's she got in there? 014053.256 --> 014054.632 Oh my god, it's too pretty. 014237.810 --> 014240.330 You'll see me at a game store. I don't know which one, but I'll be there. 014251.894 --> 014256.426 D&amp;D. &amp;D. 014304.679 --> 014309.855 I was having so much Treasure Island flashes. That's one of my favorite books, and it's 014354.484 --> 014357.734 like all of this is so good! All of it's so good! 014357.734 --> 014402.549 Whitestone saw the fire. 020204.093 --> 020206.863 If I can take ten minutes of this time sitting manacled to cast Prayer-- if enough of us 020437.839 --> 020439.480 are within 30 feet of each other right now. 020439.480 --> 020444.340 It's all vocal. 020446.848 --> 020447.800 It's only verbal. And I tell them. 020450.988 --> 020453.394 I'm going to be healing everybody. It's a thing that I-- 020456.470 --> 020457.968 (loud sigh) 020500.360 --> 020502.281 All right, that's fine. 020504.272 --> 020505.581 This is what you get for Counterspell. 020641.807 --> 020648.475 It's just a cheek caress, then gone. Not even a kiss goodnight. 020654.325 --> 020701.265 This is basically a short rest? Is this what this is? 021453.479 --> 021455.196 I think there's already some work that can be checked, if that speeds it up. I mean, that 021844.402 --> 021845.550 should be-- 021845.550 --> 021846.866 Oh, yeah. 021849.369 --> 021855.306 We'll be fine. 023238.540 --> 023242.396 Wow, fuck you! 023322.750 --> 023324.743 Fucking belly flop into the water! 023331.765 --> 023333.359 Come on, Jester, let's-- 023419.234 --> 023421.277 That's right. 023422.062 --> 023423.825 Yeah, we've got a way. 023508.383 --> 023510.219 I'm going to try and calm the crew a little bit. 023720.179 --> 023720.819 I'll point out that we're-- this is all good. We got away from the pirates, everything's all right. 023727.299 --> 023733.088 That's 15. 023735.883 --> 023742.336 We don't have to pigeon this. I mean, we know what you can do, so maybe paint the fix for it. 023920.529 --> 023921.994 We're going to spend a day moving slowly, but I think we're going to slowly figure 024043.736 --> 024049.953 out how, between all of us, we can repair this, and I'm sure we can figure out where to get some cloth. 024049.953 --> 024052.505 Yeah, it's a lot different kind of game. 024053.990 --> 024059.236 Or an island where we-- 024154.879 --> 024156.953 We can use Divination. 024410.368 --> 024411.474 If it's been 24 hours-- once I have a long rest, I can take my morning meditation and 024421.140 --> 024427.002 ask the Wildmother if there's a place of calm for our boat. 024427.002 --> 024428.463 I can do a lot of stuff, man. 024429.425 --> 024431.643 I was going to do that. Yeah. 024436.744 --> 024445.127 Yeah, in the early morning I'm going to go to the crow's nest and have a ten-minute 024510.048 --> 024517.103 meditation and ask the Wildmother which direction we should be heading to find some safe harbor to 024517.103 --> 024520.343 heal ourselves and heal our boat. 024520.343 --> 024522.521 Yes, it is a 4th-level spell, it's Divination. 024525.561 --> 024527.144 I'm using it. It takes ten minutes, and you can be as obtuse as you like. You can be a 024534.692 --> 024537.695 bird that flies in a direction, an insect, or whatever. 024537.695 --> 024540.725 I was seeing if there was anything else I can do-- I'm setting day two spells so we'll 024608.281 --> 024609.649 have food and water. 024609.649 --> 024615.819 Sea smells different today.

That's fine. 031328.697 --> 031335.039 I do. 031417.812 --> 031418.835 Actually, this is a check, not a save, so it wouldn't-- 031421.979 --> 031428.604 15. 031435.719 --> 031436.744 19. 031445.529 --> 031447.356 That was my third, was 19. 031448.655 --> 031452.391 That's a very good idea. 031542.960 --> 031547.198 Oh, this means we'll probably have to go in the water. 031629.654 --> 031632.426 I'm also going to put Bless on the octopus before it. 031656.839 --> 031658.782 It's one minute. 031703.711 --> 031710.864 Let's have them. Let's tell the crew what's up. Early in the morning, at first light. 032240.169 --> 032243.316 I'm always making breakfast. I'm not going to even use the weird plants. 032248.292 --> 032250.412 I've been putting that weird fruit in everyone's food for a week now, by the way. Just 032254.156 --> 032255.658 so we're clear. 032255.658 --> 032256.974 Just kidding, but wouldn't that be great? 032259.681 --> 032300.757 Everyone's just be like, "Wow!" 032302.582 --> 032307.843 I do. 032728.534 --> 032730.066 On my staff. 032732.895 --> 032735.136 Scarred for life. 032827.365 --> 032828.900 It never ends well. There's no right answer to that question. 032847.526 --> 032848.741 Water weasel. 032854.433 --> 032859.344 We have bugs and cheese. 033010.125 --> 033011.043 We always got bugs and cheese, man. 033018.771 --> 033022.181 There's a couple of options here. 033042.761 --> 033044.123 Well, we want to be able to carry them so if we have some small bags maybe? 033048.097 --> 033050.421 We can just put them in a bag that we can hold. 033052.228 --> 033055.231 I dim the light. 033521.574 --> 033524.777 My weapon glows but I did snuff it down.

Like a cop said "you're trespassing" and now we're just going to 033845.903 --> 033847.468 never trespass again? 033847.468 --> 033848.351 We were freaking out all for two weeks straight. 033920.978 --> 033921.919 That was entirely worth the amount of data it took up on my phone. 033932.022 --> 033933.685
