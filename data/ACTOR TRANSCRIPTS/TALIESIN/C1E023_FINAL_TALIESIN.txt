To Jim! We can make a little ring. Teach me of your ways. Well-oiled. We were hearing very weird things from the other end of that ear piece Oh, Zahra! Would it help if there were trolls? All right, so if there were trolls, it would be better that you missed everything. There weren't trolls, but if there had been, it would have been better. Yes, Keyleth. Where is the flying carpet? It seems that an enormous amount of alcohol has given you some perspective. I'm very proud of you. Well done. I have a strange thought. When was the last time we went home? Greyskull. And pick up our money. You want to try again, don't you? Oh, give me strength. Why not great berries? You just NPCed me. Just NPCed me all over the place. Taliesin is my mother's name, please. No. It's not my mother's name. She wasn't well. Carry on. Oh god. It's all right. We didn't touch in my family. Go ahead. Was there a Looney Tunes hole in the wall? (laughter) Yes! That's going on your tombstone I realize what I'm doing, and I stop. It's all right. He's from Emon. Hunter's Mark one of them. Why are you telling me this? Of course I know. We whack him on the head before he starts to do the hand. Stop it! Good chap, I'd like to place a bet. 500 gold pieces on Philip. I believe in you, Philip. It's terrible. Oh! Witchcraft! Are we that predictable? You turned him into a stain. Our little boy's growing up! None of us remember that. At all. If you grow enough beard, you can knit it together to hold it in place. Scanlan, are you all right? You look a little poorer, somehow. Have you lost money? You look like you've lost money. Especially in the face. And that, kids, is chaotic neutral. Beautiful! If someone were to be an idiot, where would you take them to hold them? Just let it go. Oh boy. But you owe-- She's got 20 gold. You still netted a profit. Be gentle with that. Apples don't grow on trees. Emon by way of Kraghammer. I just need to pick up a little bit of ore on the way out so I can work on making some more ammunition on the way to Kraghammer. We'll prod that. In great details of the internet. Just saying. I went there. It was already there. Too late! You did what you had to. It's halfway. I think Kraghammer is in between us and Emon. It's not hard to get a little bit of ore. I'm just going to pick up some. And has antlers on her head. I like your antlers. There's nothing. It's just a very reasonable reason not to take you too seriously. I have a brilliant, if slightly inebriated, thought. I have an even better brilliant, yet slightly inebriated thought. My thought is I can probably find some of the ore I need to procure at the same time that we find this Groon fellow, and at the very least, you can strike up a quick conversation with him. You can give them a medal! You're already been arrested today. Yes. What happened to my dice? Okay. 14. Hello? Charming. My name is Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski De Rolo III. Thank you. I was sent here in terms to hopefully negotiate the purchase of some black powder? I heard-- I gingerly enter. I would hope so! How much for a barrel or a hogshead's worth? I can! It's as if I can see the spittle myself! How about 400 even, and you can direct me to some ore, as well? I thought you might have a friend. I love Percy. 25. I'm sure you have a friend. You must. You seem so amiable. My good sir, you have a deal! I gingerly put the purse down in front of me. Thank you for all of your help. You've been so kind. I might do that. I'm going to walk over to Samson's place and become very excited at the prospect of a new accent. 4.3 from the Russian judge. Mr. Samson? The strange fellow down the road sent me to you. He said you might have some ore? He said you might have some raw ore for sale that I might purchase. You'll excuse me if I don't come in; I'm covered in explosive powder. Of course. No. Yes. Just some iron ore. Actually, I have a little invention which sends projectiles at great speed. Ingots would be preferable, yes. What could you give me for approximately a thousand gold's worth? I certainly can't carry that much with me right now. Let's say about a hundred pounds' worth? Let's say 350 gold, and I promise to always shower twice before entering your home for my next purchase. All right. 24. Of course. You are a gentleman, and apparently a worthy smith, as well. I do bid you good day, then. Good man, I will see you when my need arises again. Very bathed. In fact, quite bathed. I'm going to come back and join you. Actually, if you could just help load it onto the ship, that would be lovely. Sure. Certainly, if we can put it in the Bag of Holding, that would be fine. I... Yes, that is in fact a pig's head. It's complicated. Let's go! I keep jumping into things. Why don't we take a day or two to recuperate and then make our way to Kraghammer? You cleaved his head off with the blunt end of the knife. Plus six. Wait, wait. There. There's his heart breaking. Had I? I hadn't noticed. I have had dealings with them before. I find them... untrustworthy. (sighs) Yes, we will attend. Excuse me. I have a bit of work to do downstairs. I've already gone. (screams) (laughter) So, that money that we're owed. Why don't we do that? I think we have time for that.
