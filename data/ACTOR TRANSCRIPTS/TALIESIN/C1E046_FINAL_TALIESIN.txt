Slytherin. Slytherin. Ravenclaw's pretty good. Pretty good. I thought we called you. It's like a New York subway over here. And the year after, it's going to be at my house. It'll be great. Yeah, I can now be your companion, as of this week, in Fallout 4, if you build a robot and give it the male voice, I can be really polite to you for hours on end. LAURA and You can have me be very polite. That's the only way you can have me be very polite. That horrifies me. Normally sedated. Oh, god. Yes? I'll take a look. Ooh. That's not bad. (eerie music) 23. Are they in the clothing of the natives, or do they not look to be Ashari? They look undead. Doesn't-- Possibly. One looks vaguely familiar, but there's something wrong. We should proceed-- let's go up and find out what's happening. Slowly, and armed. Yes. There's something unnatural over in that direction. We should probably be the ones to investigate. You're okay. Let's take a look, at least. We're supposed to make sure they're not part of something larger that's heading in-- He said if they don't bother us, to leave them alone, but that we should just check to make sure that they're not part of something. Tread gently and see if they react. So it would be best to get their attention now when everything's quiet. There's only two, maybe four of them. That's exactly what we're saying. You did. 30. Let's just put it down quietly. No magic. Just weapons. No guns. I pull my sword. The d20s talk to each other and they know that you're not true. Oh my god. It's better than Tragedy Candle, really, I mean that's a shite band, to be fair. Good to know. He's not under Pass Without a Trace. (whistling) Well, that got dark. Yeah, okay. This is her game. Use one of your good dice. Should've used the good dice. I'm feeling a lot less guilty, suddenly. I was really hoping for a Fatty Arbuckle skeleton impression. I was really, really hoping for it. What you did was cool, but like, that was just my heart. All right. I'm in on this. Oh, hell yeah. Is it a candle, though? It's like a thing, like there's no-- It's a candle the way the wheelie things are hoverboards. I think it's weird. Oh, look at that! Where's the big one? That one. The one holding the tridenty thing. Thank you. Fatty! 27. I'm fast as fuck. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use my pistol. I'm going to do a trick shot for the arms. Actually, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use my bonus action to-- you know, actually, I'm going to hold off on that. I'm going to make an arm shot to the one with the trident. That was my first shot. And that's 25. And that's a strength saving throw. That just barely makes it. That's fine. He's going to take his damage, and then he's going to take another one of those, because eff that. That's 13 points of damage. All right. I'm going to take another shot. 20. Strength check. He dropped that. And that does seven points of damage. Third shot's going to be a sharpshooter shot. That's probably going to miss. 14. All right. That misses. I'm going to take a run behind and hide behind that rock outcropping. We have. We'll try and remind you if something affects it. I'm just waiting for the hand to go in and just-- Can't keep Fatty down. I actually don't. I don't know what happened to my d8's. I'll buy some at the convention tomorrow. Way better than last time. You knocked one off the plank, Keyleth. I'm toe to toe with that one right there, aren't I? It's in my space. Okay. I'm going to draw my sword, I'm going to try to do a back and forth. Let's see how this goes. I'm going to take a swipe at it with my sword. That's a 30. That hits. Yes, you did! I have fire resist on me. So that's how much? How much fire damage? Four damage? Four damage. Four. Ooh! 15 points of damage. He's being a dick. I'm going to try and break away and back up, I'm going to try and roll away from him to be on the other side of the rock. My armor class is 18, but I'm going to use my shield for plus five to my AC, so that won't hit. Instead of going to the other side of the rock, I'm going to run straight back, and I'm just going to shoot at it as I run away. I'm going to make two more shots at it. Oh, I'm going to take one more shot, because I have to reload. That's a 15. Wow! Holy cow. No, that was amazing. That's ten points of damage. And then I reload. We did not take a short rest, did we? There has been no time. 13. (singing) Take a bad roll... 13. He's cut things out of cardboard. This doesn't look fun. There was an instructables involved in this. This is just really-- we're doomed. I could feel it from that side. Yeah, I know, I could feel it. I can hook you up. I have a kit. That's not even a figurine, it's just a chunk of plastic. I'm halved because I have resistance. (laughter) Ah, you're adorable. But first you have to take your fire damage. Here, you can see it right here. You're that little red ring right there, and then your two followers are right there. If you have anything that goes in a cube, you'd be fine. Do you have anything that's a cube shot? Whichever way you want to be facing. You could just have them swat you. Like (zombie grunting noises). Weird question, what saving throw does a creature have to make with your sword? It's a wisdom saving throw? Constitution saving throw. Good to know. That was wisdom, fascinating. Okay, I'm right in the thick of it, aren't it? I'm going to break away, I'll take the hit. I don't like attacking these things straight on. Nine points of fire damage, down to four. Okay. I'm going to break away and take a run for it towards that crater in the far right corner. Thank you, yes. That ain't going to hit. That's fine, I'm going to take my bonus action, and I'm going to cast Hex on it. On the one I just ran away from. With a disadvantage on constitution saving throws. Teamwork! Ability checks. God damn it. All right, never mind. That's fine. Since I've broken off from him, I'm going to take some shots at him anyway. I'll take three shots. First one is an 18. That's seven points of damage. Second one's a sharpshooter. That's 25. I haven't actually damaged him yet, have I? That was the first damage. The second damage I haven't done yet. 20 points of damage. No, I'm not! Oh, shit. So that's six extra points, and that's seven extra points total. Third sharpshooter shot. Thank you for reminding me on the Hex. That's a 12, that's going to miss. Weird thing. Can I spend an action surge and put myself out of the fire? You know what, it's just fire. I will be on fire. I'm going to be on fire. Yay! Wow. Science check. Does oxygen penetrate the sphere? Damn it. Because that would've been amazing if he just died. That's a d8 there. Four gallons, easily. Probably way more than 50 gallons. It would be a few hundred gallons of water. Again, again! Oh yeah, this spell is awful. I'm looking forward to rolling it back through the rift. Oh, God, I hope this works. Pop and lock! Pop and lock! Wait, plus, plus-- That's halved to five. I'm going to shift my Hex to the tiny little (Irish accent) fucker. God, you've got me doing it now. Damn it. It's a plague. No no no, the one furthest from me. Yeah, right there. I'll move my Hex to him. I'm going to bust out the Bad News rifle, I'm going to sit, and I'm going to take a nice, calm, calculated sharpshooter shot at him. And Bad News just goes (click). I misfired. It's fine. I put it down, I pull out the pistol, and I'm going to take a shot. That was really awkward. That's a 25 to hit. Yeah. Six, 12, 22 points of damage. And I reload, and that's my turn. It's the girth of Gern. Where did the glow sticks come from? It's just like a weather balloon. Thank you, thank you. We actually had a Critter tweet us how much water. 225 gallons. We've got steam. I think he would lose-- Can I put myself out while all of this is happening? Shove him in the hole! You have inspiration! Yeah! With an app? Can I knock him down a notch? Can I try and shoot him to drop him out of the sky a bit? I'm going to try. First of all, I'm going to Hex him. He's hexed. I point. Hex moves over. And I'm going to take a shot to try and drop him. I'm going to take a grit shot to drop him. That's 22. And that's, what's the saving throw for that? Strength throw. Aw, really? That's fine, he'll just take his damage. Yes, thank you. That's 17 points of damage. I'm going to shoot again. Yeah, just with the pistol right now. 400. Yeah. 1,200 for Bad News. I'm sharpshooter, I have no range increment. Range increments are for-- We don't do that here. That's a 31 to hit. And that's 16 points of damage. It's going to get worse. All right, and now I'm doing a sharpshooter shot. Pew pew. That's 18? And that's 12, 18, 28 points of damage. Action surge. Fuck this guy. Same thing, sharpshooter. I'm going to be rolling sharpshooter. The other nipple. 22. 27 points of damage. Reload and one more shot! Reload, one more shot. That's 17, 27, 29-- That hits. 21 points of damage. No, but he's a sieve now. He took a lot of damage. Whoa! No. A Blanston candle. I felt it coming. Well, if you're ever looking for more customers, you'll always find them in Whitestone. So, if you make your way north. You're always welcome. Oh my! He's freezeframe. Keyleth, why don't we head home? He's going to still be there next week, by the way. A week without crying!
