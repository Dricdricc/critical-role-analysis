That was ash, something was on fire. Nice, but too soon. We're on brand right now. Is it in screenplay format? Damn. So true. Next, our musical guests, the Stray Cats. I'm excited that you happen to know them. Is there ever a right one? Usually, we talk amongst ourselves. This is why we don't let him drink. I can see fan art, weirdly. That's a clip-on. That was my compliment! It's more of a, "Meet me out back." That's all it says. "Meet me out back." It says, "Meet me out back." And on the other side of the card, it says, "Steak house." Meet me at the out back, steak house. It's great. It's a terrible joke. I feel bad for making it. The Scanlan/Grog love interest thing, I was not prepared for that. It was really-- I did. And we thought he knew a lot! Not today. Not here. Yeah. No, I'm so delighted, we're all on board, keep going. Ho ho ho, hands on the ground. (laughter) Somebody was cooking meth this year. Matt and me. She passed. It was a pass/fail class. Can we let them know that we got their letter? Can I say it? This is a lovely letter from tazman5296. Dude, thank you so much. Thank you so much for the Big Brothers Big Sisters. Everyone knows she'll cut them up. Oh, wow. Whoa, oh my god. Oh my god, they're so pretty. Aw! I got a blue one. Oh look, it has a little Percy. What great penmanship. Sorry, that was my immediate thought. Wow! BRIAN and Oh my god. That is so cool. I have my hand out. I know, it's gone. #WeKnow! Oh, that's so good. Clever! That's amazing! Wow, you're going to have to show us that letter to make sure that's true. Does that mean he gets to cut us open when one of us finally dies? She's probably watching, though. Not right now, because it's not live. I feel like those are actually good for Ashley The corduroy patches. That's true, I've been waiting for a "and then I fly away." We haven't had a "and then I fly away." Wow! I think my mom may have worked on one of those, too. Of course she did. Yeah, it sounds like something my mom would do. I'll double-check. I've got one from Joe White at RPGenius, which is a 3D-printing company. He and his team apparently listen to us to pass the time as they're working on all their cool miniatures that they make. He said apparently we increase their productivity. And then he sent me-- which is good. Work. Work harder! They sent Percy an in-game letter, which is really spectacular, from a citizen of Whitestone who was a tinkerer of his own. I'll put some quotes up later. He said that he sent-- this is a prototype of something they've been working on, and this is the only one they'll making of this scale. But they sent a prototype of something. And it has a scope. Probably not, because it's 3D-printed, but I don't know. Actually, I'm going to find out. I need to reassemble the scope at some point. Let's find out if it-- no, it's designed to look like it spins but actually-- oh my god! Yeah, in fact, that would work really well-- No, TSA, they won't be like last time! This will not be like last time. Oh, it needs a little leather strap, too. I want to do some stuff to it. What piece of music is this? No, there's sheet music on the back of the card. I'm so excited by it. I can hear the sound of one subscription being lost in the Twitch channel going (ping). I followed some of that! Yeah, thank you. That's so cool! I like the notion that a bunch of Norse got to Germany and said, "Yeah, we're done." It's cold enough now. We're done. This is nuts. Yeah, that could have gone really poorly. There's another one, man. I would say look at the letter first. We apologize that it was not porn. It was the only link on the internet that wasn't. Oh my god! This is definitely going to be a con bag. I really like anime version of us. They're really cute. Take a quick look at that. Open the box. Wow, that's very nice. What's inside? I hope it's teeth because it can then go to my teeth collection. What, man? I have it powdered. I put it in your drink every week. Slowly I am getting inside of you. Make eye contact or go slow. No. You ruined me. We've got a red d4. I've lost it in my jam-jams. Oh my god, I got the joke. This is awesome. I figured this out. This is brilliant. It's a superior healing potion, so what's in a superior healing potion? 8d4. Eight red d4s. That's clever. That's really clever. You can actually have a superior healing potion ready to go in a bag. It's because you've never been healed in your life. Blue poop, take a shot. Everybody at home, it's time to take a shot. That's a really solid poop. Too easy. Yeah. Appropriate for this time of year. Oh, hey, that's good! It's so good! There's more coming now. Brought to you by the letter L. LIAM, LAURA, MARISHA, and I'll unwrap minis. What? That's a very funny turkey wattle. Whoa! I like how the Cowboys get representation, but Trinket does not. Oh my-- holy cow! It's you and Grog. You want to wake up and just have Grog's face right there. That's a lot of work. I live with a quilter. That's a lot of work. Hey! They knew. You have to leave the United States. That's weirdly genius. I feel like I'm doing a Final Fantasy IV dungeon crawl right now. We got sent-- Marisha, Ashley, and Matt got sent some art from Steven-- Lexime, I believe? I'm not entirely sure; I mispronounce my own name. For Marisha, there are some princesses, apparently. Marisha has some princesses. For Matt, we've got a cowboy. And something else-- And then, sadly, this is for Ashley, but I guess she's not around right now. I have a bag if you want to keep your thing away from all the other terrible things-- I'm sorry. I've had some wine. Brought to you by Shlitz "Why did you have to do that?" I definitely want a bear! We added a splash of color. I will take wine. I think we did it. There's no GoPro coming. He's like the alternate evil version of you. There should be a yellow sheet of paper somewhere around here. We got a letter from the Post Office asking that we renew our post office box for another year. Thank you for being okay when all of this fills your store. Oh, Elle? Yeah, we did. From Elle? No, Sam. And this is where it devolves into "Truth or Dare." Wow, that took a dark turn! I'm going to run a game for stuffed animals. It's almost 2017.
