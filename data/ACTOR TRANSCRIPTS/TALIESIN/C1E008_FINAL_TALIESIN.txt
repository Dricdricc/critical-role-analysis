Let's at least follow the path, find a place where we can hide, and recuperate. Grog had the rug, didn't he? Shit! Yes. (sighs) Okay. Very clever. Natural 20. 27. Liam, it doesn't matter. 11. Keyleth, can you cover the entrance to where we are to give us a little bit more of a stealthy-- Please. Put a lava flow in front of us. So we have some time. Let's regroup. Sleep in shifts. We're not much use to anyone right now. Scanlan, no one else wants to go to a whorehouse with you. You'll be going to whorehouses alone. Thank you. Do I have the necessary tools to synthesize a potion out of the basilisk blood? Or we could cast a spell. That also works well. Don't cheapen this. You did. I think six hours is about what it takes. It is. It is going to be useful. Let's sleep. And what are we going to do if we find them? I think they're staying. Brilliant idea. Little piggy? Could put a very tiny knife on it. Could actually give you a nail clipper. You could clip your own nails. Let's sleep. So it's going to be that sort of evening, excellent. I'm falling asleep. And we will find him. There's legitimately nothing to be done. Lady Kima, as I'm sure you know, grief speaks before sense. Let us wait for talk of worth and talk of might until we are reunited. That went well. We've got Pass Without a Trace, so we should be all right. He's just rolling like a giant brillo brush. 17. I think it's another stitch monster. Stitch monster. I do, too. Let's continue. All right. Guys, stuff. I'm looking for signs of mining. 15. All right. Say we just gingerly try and cross against a wall. I think we may just have to walk gingerly. Plus the rock. Keeping an eye behind us, as well. Guns out. Oh, we're going to use the little thingy? Levitating thingies! It's been so long. Trinket only has the power of "adorability." Eight. Boom. We'll get there. It's so fashionable. 24. A doughnut of stone. Does he get an attack of opportunity if I run? How close am I? I can't see. Oh. Well, all right. The first thing I'm going to do is shoot twice in the face of this asshole. 14? But 28 will. Oh my god. This is awful. Six. That's just embarrassing. Thanks, mom. All right. Thanks, mom. I'm going to try to make a run for it to the stalactite by your hand. If I could even climb up on it, that would be very cool. Okay, that's fine. Try blinding him with science, that usually works. She's a magnet. I'm going to crawl and find myself a seat on top of that stalactite. That's my first thing I'm going to do. 20! Athletics or acrobatics? 13. How far away am I from the stones? From the platform? From something I can stand on that's not sand. So I could make it in a run? All right. I mean, in a standard movement action? My movement is 30. Just almost make it? I'll make it to the top of the stalactite, then. It's a he! God! Does that mean it has triple? That's a lot of math. They are. Now we know how many hit points it takes to kill a kitten. That will actually be useful. Five. Five hit points. Five hit points, everyone. Bears can climb trees. Dance. ASHLEY AND Will. Okay, I'm going to spend my movement to get nice and firm, sit myself down, pull out the big gun. Taking a sharpshooter shot. Natural 20 on the first shot. (all cheer) This is going to be so much fun. (counts out loud) 42 points of damage. I take a bead and I want to wait until the eye is looking right at me, and I want to take it right through the eye. (maniacal laughter) Yeah, never mind. Thank you for that. You almost killed a bear. Oh, Meghan! Yay! Easy decision! Yeah. Thank you. They don't break. What? No. There it is. Oh my god! That's so cute. They're like little Buzz Lightyears!
