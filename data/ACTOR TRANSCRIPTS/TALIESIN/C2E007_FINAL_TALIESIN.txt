I can see action figures busting through walls being held by hands (explosion sound effects). It's all about the back. Oh, there's no getting away from this. (laughter) (Oohs and ahs) I think I saw that. Did you see that? On the count of three? Yay! 16. That's very adequate. This is going to be the thing for the entire campaign. This is going to be the joke that never goes away. Nein! No! Don't joke, don't ever. I'm going to run straight in, take a look around. Is the undead one the closest one to me? Push me a little more against the wall. Yeah, over there. I'm going to hit that undead one with Vicious Mockery. Actually, I'm going to hit the one that has the kid with Vicious Mockery, not the undead one. Oh that's right, I don't have to roll to hit. Just a wisdom saving throw. That's three points of damage. Yes. (rasping) Drop the child! Get used to it. Yep. I'm holding waiting for them. Oh, yeah! Some would say seven. I'm going to rush the undead one. Spinning swords at bloody high speed and take two shots. Ooh! Can I do the higher ground? I'll do the higher ground. That's exciting. That sucks! I'm taking your-- Nope! That's a 15. Okay. Yep. No. That's at least eight points of damage. That's okay. That's okay. I'm now engaged in combat with him, so that's fine. I am whirling dervish that hits nothing at this point. I'm a hippie with poi right now. Might as well be a pair of pois. Wah! Wah! That hits. I'm taking a roll at the big guy. First strike. That's fine because that's a 19 to hit? 15. This is with the good sword, so this-- ooh, so this is (counting) 13 points of damage? That's adding my wisdom. With my off-hand, I'm going to take a swipe for the hyena over there. Come on. There we go! 20 to hit. That's nine points of damage. I would love to just kick that fucker right into the-- I'm going to move to the other side. I'm going to start running towards the stranger just to the left of-- yeah, I'm going to move towards that cover right there. No, the other way. Towards me. Right there, yeah. We've got to get you glasses. I was saying, if I'm not near the other door I'm going to start looking and unlatching it. Nonchalantly. This is a personal question. Is there anyone alive in here right now? Oh! Well, we'll take it. I'm swinging the door open and coming in. If you wait a second, it's only getting better. Oh, that is a question. We're here to help. Come on out. You got hit on the way to the city, not in the raid on the city? Let's get you out here, for a second. So many new friends lately. Do we need to escort them or can we send them up to the surface? If you leave your alarm up here-- That's fair then, yeah. That's a good plan. We start kicking them right up to the edge, kicking them right in the hole. Oh, people die all the time. I like this plan. I'll take a couple as well. We're going to look around, see if there's anything of interest. 18. Learn how to see in the bloody dark! I'm not getting over that. It's everything I could've wanted. It's really clever. Plus a d4. Oh dear. I was watching this, I was going to head down this direction anyway. I'm opening up the jar. There you are. Both of us? 13. 20. Fun fact, Matt's house is actually made of Dwarven Forge. Every wall, the kitchen. It's just Dwarven Forge all the way through. I know, this has to end. I'm going to use my bonus action just before this happens and I'm going to activate the second sword. I've got both of those sticks going. I'm ready for this. Let's take a line of the three of us, at least. Original run. A real initiative roll. That's something. 13. Wow, really? I slice it, catch it in the spin. Goddamn it. I'm going to hop up and move to the left. I'm not even going to use the real stairs, I'm going to get to the side up on that barrel over there. Yeah, and use Vicious Mockery on the one closest to us. So he's fine. (devilish voice) Ack! Fuck! Can't finish it! (laughter) I'm going to get to the-- No, I'm going to stay back because I'm a little-- yeah, I'm going to let other people come up first. Always. I'm going to use Blood Maledict. I do not have visual? Damn it. Fine. Welcome to the game! All right, I'm going to try and run up the stairs toward the undead guy. I'm going to take a swing at him. That's 14 to hit? Okay. Wow. Let's see what we do. That's (counting) 11 points of damage? I'm going to keep running and to get to the other side of that other gnoll. Yeah. Actually, if there's any way, can I get all the way around him? Yeah! I don't know if this is helpful, but I'm going to take my second swing. That's 18 to hit. That's ten points of damage. That ends my turn. So engaged. That's okay. You've engaged them, which means they're less likely to use their bows. Take that. Attack of opportunity-- oh, no. Blood Maledict to all fuck. Oh, look at that. Oh man! You don't want my energy, it's been bad. TRAVIS and You can make this go away at any time. Yeah, we're not good at anything. Let's stop pretending that we're good at anything. Could have been worse, although you are our tank. Yeah, it halved the fall damage. That's so mean. It hits. I'm going to rush around to the left of the big guy. His left, I'm sorry. Right over here. Right in there. I'm going to take two shots and see what happens. Do I have advantage or anything because he's not moving, or--? All right. That hits, that's a 23. I'll roll damage on that. He doesn't get the bonus, does he? None of that special power against him? Ooh, that's nice! 13 points of damage. Shot number two is 21 to hit. That's seven points of damage. I'm going to try and see what happens if I disengage. I'm going to back away towards me. Does he try and make his strike? I was just curious. I was going to hit him if he's going to try and hit me. I'm going to hit him right back with Blood Maledict. I'm going to use the full Blood Maledict so I'm going to take a little damage. Yep. Oh, I take my three points of damage. I start bleeding again from the neck. I'm going to back up a little further to get-- Right up here, if that's okay. He doesn't have a reaction, so you can back away now. I did not know that. Did not know that. We're also going to go through the pockets of the big one, obviously. Nice. [break] I'm here more than you these days. You better hide that thing. So happy for you. I'll give advantage. Advantage. Yeah. That's not good. That's cocked. Well. Never say no to gold. You can. Do any of us notice this? Yep. 13. How flammable is that nest? (Singing) Too many maps! Too many maps! No, we hit the nest. Set the nest on fire and it'll run. Oh yeah, good point. Yep! It's fair to draw a line at human sacrifice. Yeah. Let's-- Sealing the cave would be one thing, I think stealing the baby is going to be a bit of a-- We make our way. Stealthy walk. I'm pretty iffy. We're going to make a bunch of noise, we're going to throw some dynamite, we're going to get the kids to run and we're going to keep them distracted by threatening the baby. Yes, it is a plan! We will throw the sticks. Well, we have two sticks. If we run, then we'll drop the sticks. Yeah, anywhere that-- I don't want to be in the front front, but I'll be in the middle. You could do two Spiritual Weapons if you're feeling it. Nine. I'm the only problem. He's got a distance weapon anyway, there's really no such thing as a bad-- I'm really, at this point, only useful for a couple things. I'm going to keep in the back there. I got my Vicious Mockery rolling. I did okay. 22. TRAVIS 20. Are we going to redo the initiative flags? Vicious Mockery. Vicious Mockery on the manticore. I don't actually know what it's rolling against. What is it against? My wisdom modifier, I believe it's three. All right! That's one point of psychic damage and it has disadvantage on the next attack. (rasping) You should leave and protect the child. Trying to-- I'm going to back up. I'm backing up a little bit. I'm going to step back ten feet. Yeah, backing up. Yeah! Bonus action, anything? There's also another dude. First one's disadvantage. We're at our best when we're losing. (singing) Take to the sky! Oh man. Again, there's not much I can do-- I'm going to step in front of Caleb, in an attempt to be another target, and I'm going to try again with Vicious Mockery. Yeah. (rasping) You are going to be buried here! I hit him again. Four points of psychic damage. First attack has disadvantage. I'm going to be in front of Caleb. That's ten. You still have movement, too. You could go get your sickle. This is why you don't plan, Sam! This is why we don't plan! Because plans go wrong. Are you going to go for it? Oh no! I take it back! Plan! Disadvantage! Are you all right? Oh, fuck. Oh my god. Fuck fuck fuck. Oh, thank god! Fuck, there is so little I can do. I'm going to move forward a bit, I'm going to move close enough that I can-- I'm just going to keep trying to-- Put me next to Caleb. Shite. I'm just going to keep trying to give disadvantage to the first attack on the manticore. 60 feet. Yeah, it saves. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. Not even In infernal. Fuck fuck fuck. Doesn't matter. Never mind, leave him behind. Oh, god. Run! How long does Hideous Laughter last? Can you also take your bonus action to run too? Not too good. I'm going to douse the flames. I'm going to run down to the priest and douse the flames, and then give Caleb a good slap on the face. Hey! Back in the game! Time for that later. You all right? All right. Big kiss on the forehead and then walking away. MARISHA and You all right there? You all right? I know I'm so excited, our first loot. Is this supposed to happen? Yeah? Let's do this. Caleb, come on. Later. There's time for that later. Come on. Let's go get some sunlight. I'm going to grab the other side, we're going to-- yep. Sure. Let's make it all the way back. All hail, the conquering heroes! Huzzah! There was a lot. This is all very new. We lived.
