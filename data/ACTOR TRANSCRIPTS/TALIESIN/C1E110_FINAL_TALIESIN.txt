Oh. Well, then you're in trouble. Yeah, suddenly I showed up and there's 30 yards of red velvet that I've been begging for. Is there a passage so we can get out of the flow of the water, once it's been released? Well, it's either that or back out. I'll be between Pike and Grog, right there. Chaos. Introducing chaos. We're always impressed by how much water comes out of you. Last time we did that, it kept floating up top. It is also an option if we do get overrun. I think he swung at something. 15. We entered in the left side of the body? Looking at its butt. All right, to the right leg. So if we split, we probably want to keep to the core of it. We'll check, obviously, for air currents. 21. I might have been using my flashlight, I would imagine. I'm blinded? I'm going to spend my turn removing the mud from my eyes, and I think I still have a charge in my flashlight, at this point. I'm going to spend my bonus action clearing that and then-- Yeah. Is there one right next to me right now? I'm going to hop over by the little pool fountain. I'm going to back up and get out of this clump of people. You may not even hit Grog, necessarily. That was subpar. Not natural 20, but a 20 nonetheless. Yeah. 16? Do we get an attack of opportunity? So I'm going to take a swing. That hits. Actually, I crit only with my guns on a 19, right? I don't crit with my sword? The hemorrhaging shot obviously doesn't happen even though it's a natural-- That's fine. I crit, so that's a ridiculous thing to hit. 32 to hit. So that's a 1d8. Two plus seven, and it's silvered, if that matters. That's 16 points of piercing damage. You get all sorts of bonuses to that crit. Is that doubled? And you doubled everything into your extra crit-- (singing) Underground! Probably. Yeah! I'm going to-- What? Well, I'm going to use my bonus action. Since there's nothing to attack at the moment, I'm going to move slightly to the other end of that little precipice that I'm on, over where Keyleth disappeared. Yeah, get away from things. I'm going to use my bonus action to do a heal. That was embarrassing. So that's 11 points of damage. That's great. And then I'm going to hold my attack until something approaches. Yeah. Gun in one hand, sword in the other. No, I can see. We've got two light sources now. Make a splits check. So we're heading left? Let's get out of here. We don't need this. I would've made a run if I had been thinking about it. (whispering) Stop it! The question is, did you turn invisible, then run? I love that you're actually being a badass where no one can see. I make two attacks on him before anything happens, anyway. No, this is sword. Too close. I knew they would jump, so. That's 22 and 24. Yes, you know. That's 26 points of damage. Oh, wait! I get three attacks, don't I, that's right? That's right. 26 points of damage plus-- Oh yeah, that definitely hits. Plus eight more points of damage. Nope! And that hits. Yeah, okay. There's all the healing I just did. It's all gone. Attack of opportunity! Fly into the air! So there's two above ground, but they're behind her. I'm going to pull out the gun and take three shots at that thing that's swinging at Vex. Yeah! Oof, that's close. That's a 19? Then the rest of them hit, too. It's like 21 and 20, so let's get some d10s out. No, I got enough. Some d10s and some d6s. So here we go. (counting) That's 12 points of psychic damage. I don't know what that was. I'll put the first shot at that, and then shift the next two to the other one. Okay, so that's seven points of psychic damage, and 36 points of normal damage! Yeah. Okay, I'm good! Yep. This is super serious, you guys. I'm very excited about that. Oh, very nice. Knowing the history of this city, would we know what this is? It's not a crypt or anything like that? Or a very expensive crypt. Is there an image on the stained glass. Is it depicting something? I bet it's a crypt, which means that it's trapped, and I bet that means there's something expensive and interesting inside. Yeah, I'm feeling it. All right. Let's do this. I bet there's something really nice inside. It just works. Let's see what happens. Yeah. Well, which is always a bad sign, but there it is. Check for traps! I'm keeping my distance and pulling out the rifle and I'm pointing, if anything needs shooting, I'm going to shoot it. I think he's still in there and he's maybe been turning people mad. That would be my guess. Okay, then we can-- No. Oh, you do? We are nasty enough that if we have to put this thing down, we put this thing down. Titanstone Knuckles? Go ahead. Natural 20. What?! Feel you. I feel you. Oh, yeah. Two more. This could be very good. Ah, there you go. Anything in the box? Last box! Hold your breath. It's like a paintball gun. What's in the center? I think that's where the good shit was. I think this was just to take people out. The door just opens on it-- I'm in the back, ready. I'm right by the door. Who just rolled a natural 20! I'm by the door though. 19. I'm going to blow a Resolve. That'll be fun, because that was bullshit. 18? I put my finger in his ear. Do we want to open it? We paid for it. It's open, what's inside? Take everything. Let's get what we need and get out. Before it resets. We don't know. Let me take a look at that belt, maybe. Wait, you have to be trained in arcana to identify something, don't you? Is there anybody else trained in arcana? Does 23 do anything? I want to attune to it and see what happens. Next time, yeah. Let's get a little further. I mean, we're on our way, but we've got a lot further to go. I think I'm going to try the belt on and see what happens. It's obviously enchanted, it doesn't-- No, I want to find out, so I'm going to pull the gloves off and I'm going to put the belt on. There's no throat left. You just killed an NPC! Am I starting to get a vibe or am I not starting to get a vibe? The belt. Starting to get a vibe? It says. Okay. The attuned gains resistance to psychic damage, in addition they are immune to being paralyzed or petrified and cannot be knocked prone. As an action you can channel your anger to produce a shockwave of thunderous energy, as with the Thunderwave spell. DC 16, cast at fifth level. You cannot use this feature until you finish a short rest. How do you not? Yes. Clean it, please. Is that with your arcana? At a drive-in near you. Stop it! Yeah, I'm backing up. Detect undead? 29. I'm shooting it in the foot. So I'm actually making this a leg shot. Burning that. That's a 22? With a gun. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, that's 17 points of damage, plus five psychic. And it has to make a strength saving throw. 20. Goddamn it. That's fine. I'm going to shoot it in the foot again, because that's what we do. Is that cocked? Goddamn it. I know. That's okay. That's an 18. 24. I know. That's ten points of damage, plus five psychic. And again strength saving throw. Goddamn it. That's all right. And to make life a little more fun, let's take a head shot, because obviously he doesn't want to go down. And that's a 25. That hits. That's one more of those and one more of these. And that's 11 points of damage, plus three psychic. 14 points of damage and a constitution saving throw. Holy fuck! Never-goddamn-mind. And with that, I'm going to dart in back behind Keyleth. Is that as far back as I can get? Yeah. And I'll use my bonus to reload. He started attuning to it before the break. (laughter) What if it heals him? He hits him so hard it actually puts health points back into him. Craven Head. What? I'm so amused. That'd be amazing! Oh, that other room. We don't know what's in there. Fuck shit up. That one that just got up is irritating me, so I'm going to start by shooting him in the face. That's irritating. So that's a 32 to hit. That's 12 points of damage plus five psychic, so 17 points of damage. That's irritating. All right. Hitting it again. That's 26 to hit. And that's, ugh! Nine points of damage and one psychic. That's ten points of damage. For fuck's sake. Are we missing something here? Yeah, fine, all right. I'm taking a third shot on that one. Well, irritated by that one, I'm going to turn my attention to the one that's bothering Keyleth and Scanlan, and I'm going to take a headshot at it. Burning grit, because fuck it, it regenerates. Let's take a headshot. And that's 32 to hit. And that's 16 points of damage plus three psychic, so that's 19 points of damage. And he has to do a constitution saving throw. God fucking damn it. Stop it. That's really irritating. I wasted so much grit, and nothing's happened. All right, I'm going to back up even further out of the room. I'm going to back up to the very edge. We need some fire. Oh man. What the hell? He's so excited. It hasn't been hit yet since she-- Vax, do you want to check for traps and see if there's anything interesting in there? Yeah, that's all. Ain't nothing else happening. Just taking a look. Yeah, she's got this. I'll check for traps. It's a 22. I'm going to check that trunk. The chest. This is not quite as-- seven. I open it.
