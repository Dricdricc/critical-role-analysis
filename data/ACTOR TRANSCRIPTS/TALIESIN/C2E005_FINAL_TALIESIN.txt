This is true. I got bribed. I'm purchasable, putting that out there. That got weird. We're one episode in. Wednesday night. Don't send your gum. Significant improvement. Yes, I'll have a donut, thank you, please. I was just going there, damn it! Bangarang! What does "not that old" mean, does it mean they're young? Is it good and do we gain or lose hit points? It's change, but travel is travel, so. Oh yes, we traveled forever. It was constantly on the road. Once we left home, we stayed moving. Oh, things. I'm not really much of a performer, I'm more of-- Help set up. Help run the shows, help make illusions, that sort of thing. I guess you could say a techie. I show off a little bit of the sword juggling. I've got some things I was working on. Like this. Yeah. Little roll. Well, it's a curved sword. So not the curved ones. But I could probably do a straight sword. I'm not going to swallow a curved sword! That would be very complicated to pull off. I'm flexible, but not that flexible. I'm pretty flexible. Yeah, I never nailed anything down for a really good act. Not my incense. I'd like to see that. I didn't know that. I try. Do they look like they're unicorns? 20. I'm fine with that. Hmm. Do these people look like they're in the mood to stop? What's insight? Oh, where do you see that? Oh! There it is. Thank you. 19. I'll balance one of the swords on my head and flash the cards and see if anybody bites. They didn't poke the parents. Ah, it's very good. Yes. It means that you're on a cart. Can you get away with something like that? And stealing is wrong. But if you did it, could you get away with it? Careful, those fingers are loaded. Interesting. I was going to say, yeah. I'll take a round. I'm used to keeping an eye out on the road. I'll sit with the cart for the first roll. That would be actually extremely-- She's starting to believe. I'd say let's get a bit off the road, if possible. It'll do. Set a tent. Start a fire. They take an awful lot of time to put up. You do know this. There's a process. Oh, it would be amazing. I've done it. It's great, but this is nice, too. We can chop it up. A single tear pours down a porcelain cheek. I'm still sleeping. Welcome to human. I'll take it. Turd watch. Six. I literally don't know. That's actually the problem. Travis, it's been nice playing with you. I thoroughly enjoyed your accent. Everybody back? Yeah, you look it. Was it a lot of water? I'm going to do something very weird. I'm going to walk over and dampen my hand on the water on his chest really quickly and (sniffing). Huh. You don't know that. Only one way to find out! He's not wrong, though. It actually is a pickle. You can taste it. Yeah, it's not bad. Level three. Where is the sword right now? That's a great trick. 23. This whole story, I've been watching. That's so disappointing. All right. Unless he runs away. He's fine. I remember all of mine, I don't know. If you're going to vomit something, salt water's pretty decent. It could have been way worse. Oh, it's far superior. Already, you're proving to be an asset. You can't drink-- the salt water makes you thirstier. It feels like you should be able to, but you can't. Does the horse have a name? If it did, I'll make one up. Try not to name them. We're just going to end up eating them. His name was Winter's Crest. If he lived that long, that was when we were going to butcher him and eat him. You can rename him, it's fine. That was the plan. It means you're going to eat meat, and then you're going to make some jerky, and then you're going to buy another horse with the money you make. We celebrate everything. Just glögg. Lots and lots of glögg. If you're on the road long enough, you eat a lot of animals. You eat a lot of beasts of burden. I'll keep. Ugh. I did until it bounced. Five. I might be distracted looking for things that I can pluck out of the fields. All right. Most of us can see in the dark, it's not a big deal. (singing) Must be nice. Natural 20. So you go to your HP. That's weird. Let's head that direction and start yelling at people. TRAVIS and I'm going to stop one and ask what happened. What has happened? That's weird. Is this making my spider sense tingle, can I track them? Okay. Okay, all right. I start one of my swords on the back of my neck. LIAM  We are sitting ducks here. What do we do, Fjord? 21. I'm preparing. How close am I to this thing? Does it see us? I'm going to use Vicious Mockery at it, really quickly. I'm going to use Vicious Mockery. I'm going to look at him with my eyes glowing, and my sword glowing, and in Infernal say, (rasping) The light comes to blind your eyes and burn your flesh. Yeah, 1d4. Yeah, it's a wisdom saving throw. Yup, so he takes three psychic damage and he has disadvantage on his next attack roll. I'm going to use my bonus action-- yeah, fuck it, let's go for it-- I'm going to activate both swords. Should I? Yeah. He may have licked a couple of them. It's a very pretty die. Nine. Oh, nope, never mind, yeah. Nine. I want them to get a little closer anyway. They're all far. It's going to go great. Yeah, this is what was coming. I'm going to take a run. Am I going to do this? Am I going to be this idiot? Yeah, let's be an idiot. I'm going to take a run to try to get cover at the other house. I'm going to try to run across the alleyway. Yeah. Dashy-dash. Yeah. That's my round. I just (zooming). There's one on the roof still, too. You get bonus actions all the time. Is this--? The damage may have-- Yeah, I don't know what the crown is. Concentration's gone. You could even make it to get into his face. Hey! I'm not used to melee combat. This is so terrifying. I don't want to get up in that. I'm going to stab this thing that just fell right in front of me. Just going to stab it. Question about Rite of the Dawn, is it just plus three or is it just my wisdom or is it also a--? Okay, this is not an undead creature. So it's just an extra 1d4. Okay, just checking. That's how that works. Okay, cool. See if I hit? Thank you. 13? Oh my god. I hit it with the other one. Come on. Oh, thank God. 21. So that's nine points of damage. Yeah, that's right. I can break combat with it. It doesn't matter, right? At this point? Or does it get an attack of opportunity? There's no way I can circle up onto the wall, is there? Yeah. Get a little vantage on him. I want to be able to hop on because I want to head that direction afterwards. All right. And that way, if he tries to run or do anything, I can futz with him. This is becoming a thing. That's new dice, man. You made lemonade. Way to make some lemonade. It will move slower if we kill them. Man, I hate level three. This is fine. I know, I'm being an asshole. Man, I'm normally the one with shaky hands. We can take out people pushing it. Does he have a spear? I thought he had a bow. Oh, he's got both. No, it does not hit. I'm taking a slice at this guy again. I don't have advantage anymore. Slice number one. Oh, for fuck's sake. Ten. Slice number two. That hits, thank you! 23. That's five points of damage and two points of extra damage. I'm going to try and circle around it to get out of the way of the archers. I'm going to hop back off and get behind him. I like the theory that he doesn't burst into laughter, he just holds the groan pain. Two, and I've got one. I'm going to snap at him. I'm going to use Blood Maledict. Yeah, no he ain't. That is my armor class. Nope! Oh, come on. Wait, is it his turn already? Because I was going to run that way too, I thought we were still-- Okay. So I will-- I was going to run to see where the cart was going. Full dash. No, I wouldn't. Is he triggering my spider sense at all? Okay. I know, but you know. That's why it's like a bear. This was just our little patch. Our gnoll patch. Now's not the time! He is so down. You got to be fucking kidding me, really? Oh, I'm down. Thank you. What were you thinking? That's literally the only thing that's been happening. I'm going to put out these fires. Oh, I'm not getting up. I'm going to crawl back towards the-- That was weird. There were. What turns them like that? Is there something in the water? Word came? Word came that they were in the south? Where did word come from? Petting zoo. Well, and we're going to need some lodging anyway, so perhaps some trade could be worked out. It's literally glowing like a candle right now. I feel really bad for saying that out loud. I'm fine with the floor. Was there beer downstairs? Was there ale? I'm going to drop my things and run downstairs. Is there drink? Is there smoke? I'll take something interesting. Fast or slow? How much? Nonsense. What's top-shelf price? I put a gold on the table. Consider it an advance, it's been a rough night for everybody." And I'm going to sip this mother. That sounds nice. I'm going to sit, and sip this, and grin, and very silently have a mild nervous breakdown about what just went down. This is working out weirdly, I'm excited. We now need to have a Stephen Chow night, that was some crazy shit.
