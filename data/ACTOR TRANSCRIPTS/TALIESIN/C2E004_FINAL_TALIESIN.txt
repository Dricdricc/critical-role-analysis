I think we need to bring it. I think we're going to need a trophy. That'll do. I'm going to give the body a quick search to see if there's anything. Do I recognize any of these rings? All right. That's disturbing. Suppose I should. I'm going to try and carve off the head. This is as far as I go one this one. That's way too heavy for me. I'm going to grab Toya. LAURA and I think that's a very good idea. I did share meals with this person for two straight years. Never mind. I'm walking away. I'm already walking away. I took the kid and am walking to the boat. LAURA, MARISHA and You're the worst. You're all the worst. I know, dear. You've been through a bit. There's been some bad business. (sighs) A friend turned on us, but it's going to be all right. I'm going to get you home, all right? I'll explain it later. Oh, yeah. You're a monster. No, it's not that bad. I've got some new stuff coming in. Coming in from the Feywild. Oh. Can I reroll? Then that's nine. I know. It's going to be a bit rough, but it was for the best. I'm so sorry. Some people just turn, I'm so sorry. He got sick. There was something inside him. There was something that made him do some bad things, but it had to be taken care of. You're going to be all right. Biggest frog you've ever seen. I was trying to keep her away from that. The Barney that been raising her, yes. Really take that in. Off to a great start. I'm trying to keep her quiet. You should. I'm going to take her to the front of the boat and keep her far away from all that. I've been listening. I pull out a gold coin. Give him this. And now there's a little girl. It's all coming full circle. I'll let that go. Took a lot out of us. If you see us, we won't make eye contact. It's a shame we didn't just get rid of a wagon not more than one night ago. Someone else may get to it, or something might happen. What could people do with the head of a creature like this? Would I know? For the moment. We need to get this one back to the circus, too. You might be helpful for that. I'm hoping Toya will-- She knows what to say when guards are asking questions. She's had a bad night. We'll have a talk. We'll get her to some people who can calm her down and make sure she remembers how we take care of each other. Sorry, dear. I was hoping that we didn't have to have this conversation in front of strangers. It turns out that that was-- Kylre did that. I don't know why. Something snapped. He's hurt and killed a lot of people. We think that maybe he's been making you sick too. Gustav is having trouble with the authorities. We're going to need to all work together to save him. The twins are being the twins, Ornna's being Ornna. But I think we can save everybody. We just need to take care of each other. I felt it. No, I want to hear this too. Somehow that was better than what I was hoping for. You know how people outside can be. The mean girl was just afraid of you and we're going to let her go on this one. Yeah, I know. Let's get you home, okay? Choked you with my stick?! That was certainly memorable. This is so weird. Are you? It's like a napkin on a buffalo. Take her right back. No one can know that she's been anywhere. We'll explain to her what needs to be done. We still have people in the lockup. I'll be back and I have to show back up with you people anyway. I'm going to get her as quickly as possible. I wouldn't say no to it before I take off. That's canon. What is my stealth bonus now? Level two! We're going to die from bad paperwork. Literally, we're going to die from bad paperwork. 13. Oh, shite. Not even a good push to get her underneath, just back into one of the tents, or no? Yeah, I don't know they're caught, do I? I'm going to try and wait for an advantageous moment. Ooh. 22. You remember. Nothing happened. Find Ornna. You didn't see me. You just hid and waited and you didn't know that anything was wrong. If people ask, unless you hear from me, you don't know anything. I'm going to start heading back to the inn. Nice. Hmm. (sighs) I'm going to get a little closer. Just to take a look at what is actually going on. Not too close. 19! Oh, what's the play? What's the play? Ah! I'm going to-- Yeah, fuck it. I'm going to walk up. With briskly. There I find you! I've been looking everywhere. You're not supposed to leave the bloody inn you-- oh. (sighs) They're already in trouble, apparently. All right. Less questions to answer. Dance number. Xhorhas. I just whisper Xhorhas. Lot of help you were! You're right. We do protect our own. That's absolutely true. It's a common tactic. It's a good way to make your way through this world. Normally it works. We assumed, the circus, anyway, that we were being framed. We were protecting our own. Is the head in here? This one showed his true colors, and then we took care of it. I'm going to throw one of my swords down on the ground that is filthy with its blood. Oh, shit. 12. We needed someone on the outside. We knew we were innocent. We knew you didn't think so. We just assumed you were going to have us all executed and we didn't do anything. What would you have done? In his defense, it's a wonderful vintage. Her defense. Not a natural one. Shame. I don't know. That is a question. Gold comes, gold goes. I don't know how much the circus has and, honestly, I think Ornna would lie about it if we asked. Well, the twins buggered. Ornna? God only knows. Toya is back at the circus, but shaken. Very shaken. How hard can it be to make 2,000 gold? How hard can it be to steal 2,000 gold? Maybe be best to find that gold elsewhere. Suppose we should take a look at what's left of the circus. I will definitely drink. I think we should probably drink at our camp then. I'm fine inviting them. Is this a human thing to-- never mind I know. Kylre went bad. Maybe he'd already always been bad, I don't know. Let's not be throwing words around. He did summon-- He was fine for years. Something set him off. LIAM  Ah, he said it himself, you people in the circus are weird, right? So, every once in a while, a glitch. He was fine for so long. There was nothing for so long. Why? Things don't just... Maybe? Everything gives me the heebie jeebies. Shite. She is not good. She is taking it as you would expect. That's true. With her stick. Always. She's the charm, she has to come! See, charm. Drink. He is very funny. Arm wrestle. So? You've got to be putting something on the table, though. Well, if you want to surrender the sword or not surrender the sword. (laughs) Never. That's a stupid game. Get no blame from me. Ah, cheers to that! Not our best show. You have plans? I don't know, I'm thinking about it. I don't know where I'm going to end up now. The biggest one's a bit-- You could make a lot of dresses out of that tent. That's fair. Thank you. I don't-- I want to spy the rings on her hand, by the way, really quickly. I want to look at the other rings she picked up, not that she's wearing right now. They are obviously rings from random dead people, aren't they? Okay. I'm just putting that together. I think I will. Hmm, I'm not quite done with this one. We'll see. It's true. Oh no, she's had a thing the entire time. There was a little while I thought she was in on it completely. I've known her for years. I just assumed that she was in on it. Yeah. That would be great. You know, no matter what you pick, you're always welcome, right? Wherever you end up. Northeast. I've always wanted to go there. Traditionally, you have to go to a map maker. We might have a bit of something at the circus, I don't know. Insight check. Five or six months ago. 14. All right. Thank you. It's true. Northwest. I'd be happy keeping a bit of a low-key existence. Some of us are a bit sketchy with the law. Well, I figured if you're going to live your life, you're going to live your life. Does do that. There's nothing wrong with living your life. You only get one of them, or mostly. And your days are going to be the days that you're going to have and I'd like to keep living my life the way I'd like to and keep off of certain radars. Stupid phrase. Really stupid. That's just ridiculous. (laughter) Clam space. You smell fine. LAURA and You should probably get that patched up, actually, though. That is fair. I'm all right with that. Collect our things from-- my things, anyway, from the circus. There should be some spares. Take me a while to pack. Note, note, note. We don't care. We're not that attached yet. More mine, more mine! Everybody at home, grab your ticket you got in the mail. Scratch off number three. (laughter) Quiet dignity and grace. It was string and mime. I'd like to see the other guy. You know, if the monks beat you up to make them join your gang, they're not really your friends. Is that why they did that to your face there? Oh, no, they didn't. Apparently they were pretty-- Insight check. Fuck all. 11. Meet us at the circus. She really did. I'm going to pack up and head back to the circus. Start getting things together. I'll meet you there. Actually, you know what? I want to see you see that map. It's gorgeous. It's fabulous. No, I'm going map hunting. Or if she can draw us a map of how to get there. This is beautiful. We're going to Goonies this really quickly here. Ready? Take a look, it's amazing! You live in a serpent? If you pull out a real medi-kit now I'm going to be really excited. 50 bandages come flying in... Medi-kit? I like the idea of you just standing there going, [bell dangling noises] Well, that's the question are we going to be able to grab a cart or two from the circus? Like one of the little vardos? Can we snag a vardo? I'm very wary of this, but fine. Sword jugglers. Level two. Healing potions aside, you are doing something really interesting and exciting here. You're not a healing potion dealer. What are you doing here? Like this is fascinating. I don't know, I feel like you can excite me. I feel like there's something that you have to show that's really exciting. I'm not entirely sure it's all about stamina, I think you've got something-- you did that on purpose. Talk to me like I'm a child, show me something I've never seen before. Not with advantage, because I don't have it, but I was so excited. Persuasion check. 19. I'm fishing for drugs, I'm not going to lie. I've been on the road a long time, I don't remember how to do this. I skip over to the door and gingerly close it. Yes, I do. And we're leaving town today. I don't actually know what that is. I thought it was very clever. I've got to be honest, I'm not made of money, but I'm always curious for a new experience. Well, this might be complicated, I think that just-- What would-- A few experiences' worth. What would that run me? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for dragging the entire audience into this. Hopefully your children are already asleep, I do apologize. Thank you for really bringing that to earth for me. You started this. All right. Yeah, put me in for one. I'll try anything once. What's it called? Skein? No, this is not how this works. This is not how this works. We bank our moments for those moments when life is disappointing. Oh my god. This can come in handy in all sorts of ways. The fact that you had this ready means that there is no shame here. You were ready for this. I know, I can tell! A big, purple, pierced demon walked into the room and was like, hello. Somewhere around level eight, this is going to be hilarious. Somewhere around level eight somebody's going to go shopping and the rest of us are going to be like this is now, this is happening now. Years in the making. She's fine, she's just awful, you're a gentleman, I hope to see you again. I'm looking forward to this. Of course, we never met you, you never met us. I am already out the door, with a flourish. That is an extreme over-exaggeration. We got a health potion. It worked. North, to the horses. I was going to say, robbing shady people is usually a bad idea. No, I don't think it's the name of the town. What about Yogurt? It usually is. No, we've got a cart. I came though Alfield, didn't I? That's right. We have a horse. We have a horse. We have a wagon. Why be fast? What are we in a rush for? I find careful is always best. I don't get along with anybody. You know where we're headed. It is such a different world. Wow. Mail fraud. That is actually the worst crime we've committed today. Wagon's ready. I've even attempted to hide some of the contraband and otherwise. I packed well. Quite a few. Got into a bar fight. Bunch of assholes!
