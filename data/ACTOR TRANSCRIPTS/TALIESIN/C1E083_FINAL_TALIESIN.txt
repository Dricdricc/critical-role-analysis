They're pronounced Centennials, actually. I think our audience gets the joke. The camera's laughing. They're really comfy, but then I took them off and my cats found them and now they will not give them back. No, this is really true, they've taken them and they're not giving them back. And it was fun! It was nuts. No, it's good fun. I'm back in tomorrow morning. Actually, you can see me tomorrow morning at 9AM Pacific Time. It's hot. It's pretty hot. It's great. I want to collect all the things and basically use it as a play on the little Renaissance-era barbie doll. And just paint him and put things on and change armors. Ages ago. Eight with a natural one. She doesn't know you're here. And that's how Bilbo's insurance company started. Just going home. We can start again with a real job. I'm done. I'm going to peel off a little bit to the left-- I just got yelled at in my earpiece, so I will not-- Sorry, sorry. Is she really there, or is that an illusion? Yeah, try to sense. Okay. We're peeling off to the left, and I'm going to wall-walk. I'm going to keep going until I'm on line-of-sight with the red eggs against the back wall. Not that far, not even that far, like there. Yeah. Ooh, that's really clever. That's what I was waiting for. Thank you. The dog, in theory, sees invisible things, by the way. (laughs) I'm sorry. (singing) It's like rain... TALIESIN AND We'll be doomed to die if we sing that song any further. 22. 22. You don't add proficiency bonus? I'm weird, okay. That's a weird thing. Yeah. This'll be over easy. I'm so proud. So proud. (all laugh) Florentine. Poached. Okay. First things first. I'm going to take a shot with Bad News at the remaining egg. So let's just do that. Why are you doing that? Okay, good. That's a 22 to hit? So that's... ooh, that's nice. 25 points of damage. Okay, never mind. Then I'm going to take another-- okay, I'm going to take another Sharpshooter shot at it. I'm going to try to hit it and kill it dead. Yeah, I'm having a weird premonition that's making me really uncomfortable. 16? Yeah. No, sharpshooter I lose five to hit, which is why I didn't hit it, but I get ten extra points of damage. I'm feeling like now is the time to take this out of play, so I'm going to burn an... Action Surge right now. I'm going to burn an Action Surge. And I'm going to take another shot with Bad News. (nerdy voice) Action Surge. Same thing, sharpshooter shot. That misses. Oh man, regular shot, because fuck it. That hits. That's 32 to hit. I should've just taken it. But that's okay, we'll see what we do damage-wise. That's not bad. 22 points of damage. I don't suppose I have time to run a weird perception check, do I? Really quickly? Do I have a moment for a perception check? I haven't burned any movement, though. Is that center wall real? Yeah, I'm calling that. 23? Okay, just wanted to have my moment. I had a moment of horror like, oh god, that's dragon-sized. Okay, cool. Yeah. Good boy. Congratulations, we can play Laser Tag now. No, you're good. Oh, don't eat that. Don't eat that. No. No, that's only-- well, that may be something else. That's Beacon of Hope. That's a different thing. It depends on what she dispelled. There's advantages to both. TALIESIN and Landscaper. Jesus. I am so pleased that got so awful. I might get my socks back, I'm very excited. Just somebody somewhere is dropping the bass. We're probably going to want to destroy those cages, by the way. I think that we're going to get more wraiths. Quick point of order-- Is there like corpse soup in those cages, or is it one corpse per cage? Well, fair. I'm heading that way anyway, so. Yeah. I was just trying to see if I could actually get, it was giving me a problem. Oh god, it's everywhere. The next three bathtubs, glitter. This is why you never upload anything to the cloud. You ain't my friend. It was valiant. Did I see this go down? All right. I'm making my way along the wall anyway in that direction, so while I'm walking I'm going to see if anything looks worth shooting at over there. Perception check. Hey! Let's call that a 25. I'm going to cast Hex. And she now has disadvantage on strength saving throws. Yeah, I'm being a dick. So I'm going to burn a grit to cancel out the disadvantage. Better mark that like a clever person. And I'm just going to try and take a shot and see what happens. So this is with Bad News. That's a 21. One more shot. Oh, yeah. 29. Yeah. No, that's with a grit to cancel out the disadvantage. So, okay, I'm going to use that, since it hit I'm also going to shove all six of my charges through that shot as well. For fun. I'll get that back later, okay. So. Thank you, thank you, that's going to make life better later. So that's-- So that's-- oh god, I got to get more dice, I didn't even think this through. Sure. I just need three more. So 6d6 plus... d12s plus... one more 1d6 because there's some necro there. Thank you. Okay. That'll do. Here we go. Oh wow. Okay. I'm going to make that the necro because that's fun. Yeah, that's pretty good. I wish I had your power to do that crazy. All right, let's see how we did. That's... hahaha. (all laugh) 23 points of normal damage. 23 points of normal damage, six points of necrotic damage. And 25 points of lightning damage. Oh yeah, that felt good. Wow, all right. I'm going to keep moving my maximum move in that direction along the wall. If I can move any further I will, but that's-- That's fine. I just call over the headpiece, "She's down and vulnerable!" Oh, shit. Did she-- even with disadvantage on her strength check on that one? Four? Four? No. 18. 19, I'm sorry, 19. Okay. That's fine. 118. Really, we do. That's genuinely a thing. I'm alive. Nice. The world's cruel. Wait a minute. Is this magical damage? Does Cabal's absorb it? You keep going, I'll let you know, I'm going to read. I'll wait until you guys are done. I'll wait until they're done and then I'll pop in with my reaction. Literally in a hail of bullets. I'm going to activate-- I'm going to use my reaction to activate Cabal's Ruin. I'm going to absorb the spell and the damage I take is halved and the cloak gains the number of charges equal to the spell's level, the level of the triggering shot. Yeah, I don't get all nine, do I, because-- does the spell hold nine charges? Oh shit. What! Okay, so. So I'm at nine, the damage is still halved? 59 points of damage, okay. So I'm going to add 59 hitpoints to that. I'm back at 81 points, so that's nice. And I have nine charges in the cloak. Okay, that's awesome. It's never come up. That's 16 is my concentration save. My Hex-- I was busy. Oh shit, okay. Kind of a snooty dog. The wraiths didn't take any damage, did they? Silver lining. Fresh paint. No. Burn 'em, baby. Too many. No. He somehow rolled a 46 and they're trying to figure out what to do about it. Laser pointer? Okay, fine. I have the shot. Will the armor retort that or no? Words are mean, man. That's the sword? Oh, shit. You're up. Nothing I have is useful. God damn it. The Dallas? I don't have a Dallas left. Travis. I've been wondering this whole time. It was very lifelike. Burn 'em up. I do. There are no ones here. That's much better. No, that's half. Clapping from the void. Yeah, everything pops back. Only one way to find out. Does it taste like anything you've had recently? Whoa! Do I still have any theory of where she is, or do I have to roll another perception check? So yeah, again, as I'm scootching further and further back along the wall, I'm going to pull out the Animus box and take a few shots in there to see what happens. Because she is invisible. Yeah, I'm going to burn a grit for the first one to neutralize that. So, shot number one. Natural 20. I used the grit point to cancel out the disadvantage. And that will not affect the Cabal's Ruin damage I was going to add to it, because that's a different thing, right? Because that seems unfair because I can add that later. Okay, I'm just going to add the standard damage. I'm not going to crit the Cabal's Ruin damage, but I'm adding-- That's a thing. After the hit. Totally worth it. No. So that's, let's see, that's six points of psychic damage. And 18 points of normal damage. And then I'm going to add three points of Cabal's Ruin, which is-- 14 points of lightning damage. Yep. No. No, that is doubled. And I also get my grit point back because I critted. Yes! That's fine. Now for my second shot, I'm going to spend a second point to-- oh, she's not visible, she's-- So I still have disadvantage so I still need to-- Okay, that's fine. Yep. Not quite as good, but still good. 27. So that's, ooh, that's nice. That's 17 points of normal damage. Two points of psychic damage. And ten points of lightning damage. For my next shot-- I'm doing the same thing again, so I'm at two grit points. I'm trying. Not going to hit, that's going to be 19 to hit. That doesn't hit. So that one misses. I still have three Cabal's Ruin, though, so that's nice. I'm going to use my bonus action for a heal surge, for my little healing, my little pick-me-up. So that's going to give me back 16 points of healing points, so that's 16 to me, so that's... 105, I'm at 105. And I'm going to keep just scooting back along the wall. I want to keep where I'm shooting in my line of sight, but I just want to get there. Yeah, and still on the wall. Yeah. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Look, every time I have a reaction I can do something. That's crazy. This is mean. Do you have any reactions you can do? Let's just call it. We're going to have to deal with that very, very quickly. It was a kinder, gentler world. I'd give money for a popcorn grenade right now. Do I get an attack of opportunity? Do I get an attack of opportunity? She has not moved past me. Yeah. (nervous exclamation) I get the idea. Do you also have inspiration still? No, Pike, oh-- okay. Okay, okay. It's the last-ditch. I'm going to get stupid, so. Well. Things have gotten simpler. Holy fuck. That looks painful. We've still got problems. Do I get a reaction against that? I can't react to her attack. Okay, she's just going to do a legendary attack against me. Okay. Oh, that hits. Into her neck? It's called a hickey. Does she still have an attack of opportunity against disengagement, or did that legendary action-- Well, I'm just curious because I'm going to have a problem in a moment. Technically, wasn't she flanked, too? Okay. Oh, yeah. I'm the only thing within reach. Okay. I'm fine. 23 points... 61 right now. I'm at 61. Not wonderful but, you know. Do I get an attack of opportunity on this one? Weird question. Am I still-- if I try to disengage right now, would I get attacked? I'm in melee. Okay. That's fine. I'm going to run around, I'm going to hit her with my sword. I'm pulling-- putting the gun away, pulling out the sword, and just taking some shots. Yep. Okay. Let's see. The first one definitely missed, which is a 19, did not hit. 22? Okay. 22 and the other one is a 28, so I got two shots. So let's do the first one, which is... 22 points of damage plus... 10 points of lightning damage. Total of 32. And the second slash is... 21 points of damage. The whole time. So I'm... I'm now going to disengage, I'm going to let him take that shot and I'm going to run towards-- We'll see. I'm heading towards the eggs. Full speed. Okay, that hits. That's okay. I regret nothing. Stop making noises, it's not polite. Stop counting. Okay. I'm running six spaces towards the eggs and turning around and pulling the gun back out and sitting on the wall like Spiderman, like an angry Spiderman. Anything I can do with my bonus action? No. I... no. She may vaguely remember that I was not cool. No, this is the rest of the day for him, there's nowhere to go for-- yeah. Think about what you've done. Okay, yeah, all right. Oh Jesus, how is this happening? Oh, I'm out. Yep. I know. Oh, is that lose a death save? I was only a few feet up, it wasn't like a-- it wasn't-- okay. All right. I mean, I was-- yeah. Yeah, it's pretty bad. I'm taking it. Ow. Ow. (all laugh) Oh, it's so cute that you think either of us are going to heaven. I'm out. The blood is in fact blue. We've got time. In a minute. That's a long time. Ten rounds. Yeah, I know. Matt does get weird about the minute rule, that is also funny. She's just awful. Does the necklace count, or does the necklace not count? Once. As far as I can remember. Quick question. Okay, just checking. Okay. Good to know. Oh, that's nice. (panicked laughter) Oh. Is this mine? Okay. I'm going to pass out. We have to take him home. We need to take him somewhere. To the temple. And we need to find his daughter. I'm going to drop the gate stone that we have right in this room. I'm just going to leave it here. I'm coming back here to dissect that monster once we're done. I am lying down to do this, but yes. What hit points am I at right now? What am I at right now? Okay, that'll do. Thank you. I'm going to say something awful. Put him in the bag of colding. It's not like he's breathing. It will keep him safe. Let's gather what we can. We have to walk out of here. There's no other way. I'm also just going to grab Grog really quickly and just scrape as much stuff off the shelves into the bags because we need to know what this shit is. I'm going to... Grog, help me pile all of the dragon remains into a pile. The eggs. Everything. I need a pile. We're going to try and remove anything useful, especially of the eggs. Anything to know what they were. But I don't want to take the whole thing, I don't want to leave anything. We're going to burn it. We're going to burn it all. Thank you. I still want to burn it, but yeah. Jesus. It's math-lite. And hit a glyph. Someone shove him off. Let's get out of here. I'm going to quickly search Scanlan's body for his wand. Yeah. I'm going to shoot some Fireballs in here when we're on our way out. I'm going to burn it to the fucking ground. Thank you. But the gravity is off. I'll actually say, the second that we see them, I'm just going to empty the wand. Oh, will they just be fine? Can I just unload on them, I suppose? Oh, well. I've got disgusting range. What do you need? That's a lot of whiskey. I'm going to try doing a sharpshooter piercing shot on another round of them with the Pepperbox. Sharpshooter piercing shot. That's not bad. So that's-- the first shot is-- 16. Oh, then they all hit. That's good. So that's 1d10 plus 1d6, so 1d10 plus 1d6. And this is piercing shot so it's the enemy line, so. Wow. That's nice. That's-- I have no brain. 27 points of damage, with five points of psychic damage for the first shot. Okay, but it's hitting both of them in a row. Next shot is-- ha! Is 28 points of damage with four points of psychic. Mm-hm. I still have one last shot, so. Let's do slightly less that time. 20 points of damage with one point of psychic. And that's my contribution to the world. 4d8 radiant? I hit both of them. Two are down, the other two are damaged. Classic. I'd love to make an arcana check. 22. Yep. We don't. Six seconds. No. We go to the beach and we find a tree. We get as far away from this cave. One crisis at a time. We start walking to the beach. The ball. On the carpet. I'm going to take a rest on the carpet and I'm going to fly the carpet while you do your thing. She might want to save-- well. We'll see. Seems like we know where-- We would've been in trouble. That can't hold all of us. This is fine. We're going to go to Whitestone now, we're not going to go to Greyskull, and we're going to get Gilmore's help. We're going to get Gilmore's help. I'll join. No, wait. Keyleth-- I'm taking the carpet that direction. "I'll be back in a moment." I'm taking the carpet towards the speck I see on the-- and probably ten minutes in is where, I would have given it ten minutes. I'm on the way with the carpet. (yelps) I'm so tired. That doesn't mean a lot, but yeah. We're as far as we can get. Oh, thank god. I'm running for it. No time. Scry-- find his daughter. Scry on his daughter. No. Kymal. No, we have the one gate stone. She has the other one. I will go get the other gate stone. It's fine. We can make this work. And in the meantime, take him to the Raven Queen temple. Trying to put together the Resurrection ritual. Outwardly I'm fine. I'm in get-shit-done mode. I'm probably coming back down now from the castle with the stone. His daughter. Because it's the only thing I can think of that could really drag him back from wherever he is. That's my thought. I've been there, I've experienced this. I've died. And you need to... it's not easy. And you need to-- not everything cuts through. You need to find the right thing to cut through, and I think this might be it. So it's where I'm putting my bets. Guards, you're with Gilmore, you will get him into any room in the castle immediately without question. Now. I'm at the temple, I've sent them off to deal with this. Terrible band name. Ironically of course, also, I don't think we have Sam next week. Dick! We can totally, like Zod in the mirror. Way to David that goliath, man. We were like, I wonder if he's going to totally Coulson, I wonder if he's just going to Coulson on us. Somebody conquered some personal demons, this week. You're still an awkward mess, but you know. There will always be a pit of fire.
