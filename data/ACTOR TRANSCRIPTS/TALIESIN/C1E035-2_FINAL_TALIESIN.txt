I think it's fine. She was too dangerous to let live. I pull out the broken barrel and inspect it. I had some thoughts but yeah. 11. I'm going to just take the broken gun and point it at my sister. What do I feel? I think I'm all right. I think I may be all right. I'm going to do something else. You were the one who wouldn't give me the other gun. I'm going to go over to the little lab setup. Is there some acid there? 17. I'm going to start trying to scar her name off the barrel. I think it's fine. You're going to have to have some faith. No. (laughter) Well, I think perhaps we can talk to Keeper Yennen. Perhaps put together some priests to deal with that. Enlist the help of the entire town now that there's no longer a revolution to be fought. We forgot about that. So perhaps if we tell everyone the Briarwoods are dead. Cassandra? Wouldn't that be nice? Never in my right mind would I hand my gun. My insight is 21. You are going to cost me so much money. (whimpers) I'm so upset that I have to do this. Going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. For another three minutes. I hand him the broken gun. I reach in to try and grab it out. No, he dropped it! That was so expensive! Wisdom saving throw? 18. He's paying for a new one. He's paying for a new one. I'm going to have to-- oh god! It was so expensive. Oh, just throw the carpet in there now, why don't you? (yelps) You were never Mother's favorite. She told me! Oh god. Yeah. I'm letting it go. Oh god. That one was enchanted. Okay. Two enchantments. Yeah, all right. I'm not alive! 27. 25, sorry. Did the math wrong. I step forward. The Briarwoods are dead. There's still a great evil beneath the castle, but the Briarwoods are no more. There's still a matter of some things beneath the castle that we must deal with first. Can we pass by the Alcove? Pike is shocked. Pike is shocked and offended. Can we-- definitely want to go, let's stop by the Alcove. I want to stop in. I give her a big hug. This would not have been possible without your help. Thank you for everything. I have not. We have not searched the castle yet, though. We don't know. It's not airtight or anything. I mean, they're breathing. No, we're going to give him shit. There's no problem here. That's going to explode. Two years on a sitcom. I can hold this all day. (laughter) I leave it to you. This is what I really wanted to see. Grog. While we always must dispense our justice, this is now a town of mercy as well. And I will expect nothing less from all of us than to give what we have lacked for so long. Duke. Earn your life again. They've just had this shit in a Tupperware container, like in those big bins in the back for the last five years with like duct-tape lids. I want to take some time to tell Keeper Yennen about what is beneath the tree and let him start to macerate some theories on what to do-- It's a word for big name. Thank you. Do it. It's a beret. I don't think he made it dorky. I think it comes with that already sewn in. With a beret. I don't know if that's-- less aviary than celebratory. No. There are traps. We've marked them. It's also disturbing. We can send word. Is it going to be throwing the rest of my guns into a pit of acid? Replacing the guns that you threw into a pit of acid. I really can't think of what else I'd want to talk about. Please, go ahead. That is not a terrible idea, and it's possible that the books are still within the castle. And we do need to build three new structures where the lords' houses were, and I find the idea of rebuilding those mansions to be a bit distasteful. We will discuss it. It's got a ring, I will admit. You were doing something, as well. It lets you commune with nature. It's like a DM version of natural 20. In that ancient way that trees talk. Thank you. It's morning somewhere. I would be very grateful. We shall.
