I'm so excited. I haven't heard yours yet. Here, actually, do this with me. Let's make a double rainbow gif, for later. (laughter) That's on you, internet. And then if you're at BlizzCon, I think we're going to be wandering around a little bit. Yeah, I'll be there. We tried not to peek. Somewhere they're saying, "That's my bear". Address it to me, if you do. Now ten percent more realistic Critical Role. More authentic. Homebrew. That's available on Android. I almost wore my special spider belt, too, but it felt too weird. Probably like punk rock hippopotamuses. That's kind of racist. We are going to get a bunch of angry tweets from stegosauruses and triceratops. I think you revert back to normal. They are like stormtroopers. They are! You are being attacked by stormtroopers. You're fine. And when those go out, you are back to human hit points. Sounds about right. We're going off the map. You could pick 'em off as they run through. I'm not helping. I'm sorry. Not there. Shutting up. You can also hold your action. Just as an option. Not to help, but you can hold your action. I approve of this plan. You could move and then move back. I'm only helping with gameplay strategy. Sentences you never expect to hear in your D&D game. He is reaching under the table, ladies and gentlemen. Doesn't he have at least half-cover from the roof? You're doing so well. It's so great. The roof is wet. You can use Bigby's Hand to-- Fly it like the carpet. Through the sky. You did get a beret. I thought you got a beret. Ugh, why do you have to do that, man? I totally forgot. I'm so sorry. I'm at 26. I got distracted because I have a new-- I'm using my new sheet and I'm just confused, so yeah. New sheet. I leveled up, so I had to do a thing. Oh boy. Okay, is there a way in? Are you FaceTiming somebody? So is there a way in, at this point? I'm running over to the door and opening it. I can hear the commotion from inside, and I'm running in the door. I'm holding my turn. I'm holding my action. I'm going to go straight through the hallway and try the door on the left. Yeah, move the one to the right. Yeah, sure, that one. There's no way to just quickly push the other door open, too, is there? And I signal. We're going to have to thin these ranks out quickly. I'm going to be playing rule Nazi tonight. Is that attack of opportunity possible since he's grappling somebody? Trying everything I can to save this bear. Thank you for coming with me on that journey. I'm going to make a run for the door. Is it open? Can I open the door? I would have to use my action to move? You know... (sighs) Yeah, this is going to be worthwhile. I'm going to-- well... (laughter) I hate you. Shoot out the window? Okay, I'm going to be helpful. I'm going to burn my action to get into the room. Right there. Yeah, I want to stand right there. How crazy-- I don't know if I can do Minor Illusion that way right now. So I'm going to call Hex on that first guard there. Yep. I'm going to burn my action surge, and I'm going to start taking my shots, and I'm just going to work my way up. Okay. This is with sharpshooter. That sucks. Ten? 11. Natural 20. And so since that was a third shot, it was also a bonus shot, so that's got an extra-- okay! Does that mean that everything gets doubled? Not the modifier, though? Modifier stays the same. Roll twice, or just double my die? Okay, so that's-- I should have just used my-- I know! I should have just used it. Nine, 13, 26. 42 points of damage. And four of that was fire damage. Okay, I move the black cloud to the next guard. He also gains disadvantage on all-- let's make it dexterity saving throws. Ability checks, yeah, so all dex checks. That's the end of my turn. That hits. That hits. That hits. That does not hit. This is a first. (shouts) Sunlight! Yes, it is. I would have enough to point and say-- oh, for the love of god. Okay, fine. I take my next shot at the next crossbow bugger. That's 15? God damn it. That's 22. Yeah. It hit. That's 18 points of damage. My third attack, also on him, is also 22. And that's-- ooh, that sucks. Two points of ice damage plus 11 points of normal damage. I'm going to take a step forward. Up the stairs. Yeah. Because of this! You had eight. "It's a vampire!" I'm putting my gun away, anyway. What's that charisma score, again? Where is it? What's the damage on my rapier, again? Was it 1d10 plus-- Okay. Then in that case, I'm going to bring my Hex up to the very next-- And I'm going to put my gun away, walk up to him, and begin stabbing. Oh, that's right. I'm just going to walk up, not quite that close, but one step back. Take my next three shots. That's 21. That's 23. I'm going to stop there in case that kills him. Actually, I had to reload anyway. All three was reload, attack, attack. So that's 16. 14. Okay, I move the mist to the next guy. I had a bonus action, so I just used it. Did I? You're technically correct, so go ahead. We don't want people running to report we're here, though. No witnesses. They might call vampires. I'm going to start exploring the upstairs. That mist is probably following me around at this point, isn't it? Yeah. Oh, boy. Okay. I think so. I feel cruel, but in control. This is controllable, at the moment. My charisma modifier is two. I'm fine, for now. I'll let you know. You'll know if I'm not. Yes. Let's keep looking.
