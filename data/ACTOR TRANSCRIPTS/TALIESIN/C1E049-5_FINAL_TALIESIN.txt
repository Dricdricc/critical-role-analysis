Hi! I'm Mezek the monk. You actually get to use the phrase, "I've smelt it, now it's time that I dealt it." Yeah, take it. Public domain, public domain. I'm sorry if I already stepped on that one. What meat is this? What meat is this?! That's every Arby's I've ever been to. I think that's edamame. Four tooth too many, that's-- And drink. She does have a big hammer, she has a very fair point. You're the most complete, you heard him, that's absolutely true. Tarnish the, tarnish the handle of the-- yeah, it's-- And they were never seen or heard from again. Game over! Like brownies and willow, man, we're done for. There's got to be some cover around here. Did you want to go which way-- no, I know which way! I'm going to go! And I'm going to walk in a direction. Follow me! What am I rolling? I just rolled, what do I add to it? Survival? Where is survival? 19! There! I only take about two hours of responsibility today, and I'm done! It's someone else's problem now! Was that fun? Because I've experienced what I thought was fun before, and it was nothing like that! Natural one! Wait 'til you're asleep. This got weird quick. All right. There's a little box right there. (sputters, coughs) We're supposed to be stealthy, can we do it and be stealthy? Is there a way to smash humans with stealth? I want to look around and see if there's anything to add to this flotsam pile. Seven. 36. Damn! Two arms, two legs, one head, we'll find him at the end. 21. Share! Share! 16. I want to go through the vomit to see if there's anything interesting in there. Yeah we'll fight, we'll fight. What's-- oh. 11. (cackling) (raspberry noise) I have a jug. I'll go through it later. That's leaning. He folds to be one-dimensional. 31. How did he do that? When did that happen? I don't remember that. I want to keep my eyes peeled for things that might be useful or that can contain alcohol. "Oh wait!" I open up the jar-- (horrified laughter) I won it fair and square! I was about to say, can you read and write? I was imagining a goblin dick-butt. (laughter) Oh, god! Oh! Thank you, thank you. No! Oh, god. Too late. Moving on. You won't have to, you'll go on the internet in about an hour, and it'll be there. There's nothing that can be done anymore. We're not kidding. We're not even kidding a little. I attack. (laughter) Thank you. 14. That's five. The cracked man with the blue stone! No, a church tree! Those are not supposed to be solid. I see that he is. I'm approaching cautiously. Wait, you got plus six. If we pulled the two shoulder pieces off, could we maybe tie them together and wear them like an Eat at Joe's sign? I'm going to give it a roll. That's funny. No, I'm down. 12. I'm going to throw it at Piglet. Just throw it at you. That's how we do it. You did very well in that. Add your initiative. 21. That's how long. That's how long it took. Are you happy now? Are you happy? Yeah, 16 plus-- Plus one. No, and then you have to do it for the other hand, which is different, so you have to roll again to hit for the second one. And then that's plus-- All right. I'm going to-- I'm going to take a deep breath. (screams) And hit it with a stunning fist One of them's mine. 16. Let's see. It's six points of damage. And then they have to make a fortitude save. 14. It does go wobble, wobble, wobble. I'm going to take a step back and pull out my quarterstaff. Now that I've had my turn. Touch AC? Or armor class? 18. Do you need a d10? Here. That would be two. (shushes) Go with it. Go with it. --a salt with a deadly weapon. Working on it. If my parents taught me anything, it's that a burning sensation is nothing to worry about. You're good, you're good. You're my favorite. Oh god. No! Here. Go nuts. That's the serious business die. There we go. Thank you. That's the angry die. I am going to charge it with my quarterstaff and hit it with a flurry of blows. I don't have any Ki points right now, do I? Okay, so I can't make a movement. Okay, I'll take the-- I'll take a nice big, flying swing with my stick. (goblin screech) That's 13. God damn. That's seven. Seven points of damage. I want to, screaming bloody murder, squish it and splash it with the stick like you were trying to hit a rat scurrying around on the ground, and I don't care, once it's gone, I'm going to keep hitting them. I'm going to keep slapping and slapping until it's mush. I run in and grab them! It's not easy-- ASHLY, PHIL and I have the healing skill, can we try and use the healing skill to reset things? 20! Let go! Let go! You're holding a lot of tension! With vomit-based massage oil! It's organic! Do any of my flasks or jugs have any liquor in them? 20. (sniffs) Happy juice. Happy juice! I stick my hand in and go for it. That's not funny. Eight. Piglet! Piglet! Plus strength modifier. Sounds like heaven. Baby chickens? Baby owls! Done. Ale? Done. Going for the ale. I'm filling my flask and my waterskin. No, I'm just going to add it. We all heal one? Maybe you have to have a chat with a spirit animal. Nothing bad happens when you eat moldy grain. I'm imagining Orson Welles at the end of Apocalypse Now! right now, with the towel-- I like a man with secrets. Oh my-- He rolled a-- tell him what you rolled. Looks like molotov. I'll join her in it. 13. I volunteer as tribute! I tie the rope to my waist and I tie the rope to her. I have 50 feet of rope. Give it to Piglet. I approve of this plan on every level. All right. Toss-- It was hurting already. Yeah. Strawholder. All right. Well, I only have 50 feet of rope. That would have gone poorly. It's the Golden Snitch, man. Don't fuck with the Golden Snitch. I was about to say, that Golden Snitch never rolls well, though. It's funny because it's true. I drop the rope. I'm going to look at the ceiling. I want to see if there is anywhere we can attach the rope to the ceiling to make a swing. Very impressive. MATT As you finish tying the rope, helping each person up, each of you manage to climb, having it tossed back. It takes you a while to get going, but you do manage to-- PHIL We've now been on this quest for five days. TALIESIN In my head it's all Henson puppets, and it's adorable. It's like Fraggle Rock, I'm there. (cheering) Yeah, yeah. Nine. I drink everything in my flask at this point. I've got to keep drinking. Someone upstairs finally jiggled the toilet. Yes. No, I'm really excited that this is a thing that's happening right now. Wow, we went back. We're inside an outhouse? I've got very high stealth, too, so I'm going to come in with this. We're going to sneak in to get the coat. 31. 37. (heavy sigh) Does Zed have anything on his person other than a coat? I'm going to grab one of my goblin jag stars and I'm going to pop one of the bottles on the shelf. I assume there's a shelf of bottles. I'm going to pop one on the opposite side of us to try and knock it over. That's 20. Grab it! Where's sleight of hand? We don't have it. 19. I want to see if he's got anything on his belt like a pouch or anything like that. I want to make a stab at grabbing and ripping it off. What am I rolling? 15. 34. While we're running, I'm going to take my jar of puke and pour it out on the ground behind us like a mud slick. We can run all the way around the alleyway from this. Let's get down the alley. Well, we've got the high dex. You should be the middle, so we'll be the legs. What's in the pouch? Ooh! I eat all the snuff. Where's my will saving throw? There it is. 16. We're the legs. Oh god! Five. Hup! Running towards it. Too many tooth! Get the rock. Ten. Oh, shit. Five. You can do anything you like. We've got the rock? Four. Five. Thursday night. It's a nice Sunday night right there. Follow your heart. We are hard to hit. Moldy grain, man. Not even once. Do not sneeze into the wind! You sneeze yourself to death. The guy who's on fire, who's not doing well, right? I'm going to run screaming at him. I'm going to (yells) throw one of my awful stars directly at him as I run straight up to him. I am using my deadly aim. That can't possibly go poorly. That's 18. I don't have to roll damage, it's an auto. That's six points of damage. (yells) I'm straight up in their business. He's on fire. Yeah, you can hit anybody you like. There's a bard, a cleric-- He's run off. Yeah, he's the yellow circle. Yeah, do them all at once. 20. I take zero because I have evasion. You're as close to a tank as a goblin can be. Golden snitch, motherfuckers! You still have a bite attack! Cleric's right there. That's a nine. It's on the third square on the right. I'm going to run up to the cleric who just paralyzed my friend. I'm going to run right up to him. Him, her, I don't actually know the right pronouns for the cleric. And I (yells) and I open palm into the throat to use a stunning fist to try to silence her. That's a 15? I said fist, I'm doing fist. That's five points of damage and needs to make a fortitude save. She is stunned for a round. You could try to maybe reroll it with a song. You haven't used your song yet. How is that even humanly--? I cast Methadone. Red Bull! This round might be your last round. I'm going to use my Flurry of Blows, with my quarterstaff, and I'm going to use Stunning Fist, again. Yeah. Well, Stunning First, is it fist or first? So I'm going to (punching sounds). I'm going to use the quarterstaff. For the Stunning Fist first; that's 20. That's six points of damage. So I'm going to hit her again. The cleric. The cleric is unconscious. They can't do another round of anything. Hitting her again. That's 12. To hit. It's time. Reroll that. (singing) Mezek, Mezek the songs he is keen, so pour a pint of beer for me or I'll punch you in the spleen ugh! Yay! 19! I'll use the flashy pink one. Oh, that's better! Eight points of damage, boom! Quarterstaff one to the front and then I just want the quarterstaff to find a chink in the armor and just watch the head cleave with just stick. A big melty, awful cleave. Like, wood should not cleave. Am I within quarterstaff contact of anyone else? I'm going to hit the bard. I'm going to spend my ki attack and hit the bard. 11. 14 points of damage. Straight stab. I want to go straight through the mouth all the way through the skull and I want to hold it there. Music to my ears! (laughs) I'm going to hold it for my next attack on the next round. Fuck yeah! Holy shit! Still funny. It is now! Can you take a bite? Plus your reflex save? I want to see if I can get enough of a pull to remove the head of the bard from the body and fling it as a projectile attack at the wizard. I'm the worst person you know! That'll work. Four. Add three? 14. I'm running straight towards him. He's flanked, also. Nose is good, we haven't done that. Back to the sewers! Power was with her all along. I'm so proud of you. (singing) How sweet the sound! And an empty snuff box tin. I was prepared to go down in a blaze of glory. Congratulations, we are the darkest timeline. Have you actually ever breathed fire before? Sneezing fire would blow my mind. I've never seen that before. Oh my god, they have a Wilhelm! This, by the way, is what an evening at Matt Mercer's house is like. He's sitting going, "Look at this!" (trombone) This was Sunday evening, pretty much. Add YouTube and that's pretty much it. Just think, you might have lived if you hadn't taken that bramble damage. I just want you to live with that. Sleep like a baby tonight. I want you to sleep like a baby. You're welcome. Live with it. I got the one. I roll really well. I wrote mine on my lunch break today. It's going to be crazy. I love Hole. I don't know Tune. Oh, Tune! Yes. I've been trying to dig up Tofos for you, too.
