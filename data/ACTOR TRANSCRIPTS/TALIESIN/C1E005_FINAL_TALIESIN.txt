What kind of sack is that? I think we have some prisoners to free or something as well. Parseltongue? I think that's very reasonable. We will not kill you. So we have to leave you alive, and let you leave this building intact? I actually think this is an appropriate moment to play with a bit of banditry. I say we take everything from him and he can make his way out all on his own. I'm with you on that. Well, we can see that's obviously worked out really well for you. I think that I'm satisfied, are you satisfied? Would I recognize this creature he's describing? Or arcana? 14. 14. I did arcana. In fact, we'll be keeping your weapons, your armor, and I believe, your pride. You may even outrun the dwarves we're about to set free. ORION and I'm in a mood. Alive was the deal. Some people are terrible losers, just really terrible. Do not be an oathbreaker. Know when you've lost your clothes. Laura, you got a grapple arrow, last I gave you, by the way. Yeah, I got it-- you now have a trap arrow. Yeah, you fire it and it prones somebody. I'm gonna Hawkeye you out at some point. I know. Yeah, it's not like a string arrow, although I'll build that. It's a trip arrow. I'll make you a grappling-- I didn't follow that though. I'll make you a grappling arrow. We have a flying carpet. Trinket's back on the other side. 19. 24 points? I'm at 15. I was already really low. Oh, did I fully heal? Yeah. Scanlan's peeing, peeing down. He'll be fine. The bear can take care of himself. Oh my God. Oh boy. I grapple onto her to hold her down. Us. I'm going to brace to jump. I'm bracing to roll. Off what? No. 23. Still gonna knock me out. I'm out. Yeah. Is that-- Is that just-- A nine. 2d4 + 2? Oh! So I'm at plus eight now? MATT and She was gonna do a Mass Healing-- I'm up. This is, this is-- 24? Will a healing potion work on Clarota? I've got a potion, so-- What's a level two potion do? I am. 17 points of healing. Who has a medicine? 22. Sounds good. We just hear (bat sounds). Yes. We go. With haste. There's no right answer here. It's just-- Yeah. Yes! I'm gonna look for a seal, to see if there's a seal anywhere around. Bam! Kima was here! Possibly. We can rest in shifts. I don't think we need a fire. How much does a rest heal? Out of curiosity? Oh, excellent. Do I have time to do a quick engineering feat, as well? Oh, okay. Never mind. Make an explosive arrow. I'm just in a mood. No, but I have gunpowder. Yeah. That's fine! What do I add? Am I just straight roll? Oh, okay. Proficiency bonus. 15? Okay. I have another gift. Explosive arrow! It's a bit iffy. It's a bit iffy. It'll get better. It'll get better. I don't think you want an explosive axe. It's very unlikely to explode on by itself. 'Cause it needs to be moving at a high speed. But it's just not the best thing ever. Yeah, no. Not straight behind. The next one will be better. Yep. You were just going all Inception on us. Spin the top. Spin the top. (whistles In the Hall of the Mountain King) Doo-agar. We should probably be quiet. Oh god. I'll be out of the hole. Commune in a commune. Oh god. Bats. It's humid in here. For god's sake. Oh. Or just melted sand. Trip him again, trip him again. Let's keep going. Yeah! That sucks. Lava pools. This is a d20. 13. Yeah! Whoa! Yes! Yeah! I'm still happy. Oh my god! Fire? (sings) When we have to fight the ooze, you'll never have to lose. Well, we should kill it. No! The stealthy reach-around. The stealthy reach-around. It's okay. Okay, I'm going to try something weird, here. Where am I? Okay. I'm going to step forward and to the right a bit. Just sort of joining this little-- like getting right in here. And I'm going to try and shoot, and this is gonna sound weird, but as I'm running I'm going to-- Actually, back me up to about there. I'm going to try and shoot about right here, I'm gonna try and unleash the lava to send the lava-- to see if I can get it to start flowing towards. Does that make sense? Oh, it's just down? Okay, well-- -- I've come forward enough, I'm gonna take a shot at one of these guys, then. That one. I'm gonna try something else. I'm gonna try an ice shot. 15? Oh my god. All right, and that's a-- -- that's 15 points of damage, plus six points of ice damage. Fuck! That's right. Oh, good god. Yeah, no, that's-- Okay. I'm going to attempt to-- Is there any loose-looking rocks that are up above? Or is there anything that looks like, if I gave it a push, would fall down, from up above? I'm gonna take another shot at the same one and see what happens. 20, that hits. Not a lot. That's seven points of damage. That's nice. Wow. Flame on. (all laugh) If you rolled zero, you rolled a ten. What? Coffee jello. Oh, god. Jesus Christ. Where's the laser? Laser. Oh, never mind. Yeah you had it, aha! I wanna move just slightly to my right. Just over there so I can get a clear shot at the oozes. Yeah, about right there, so I'm not going to hit anybody. I'm gonna take two shots at the little oozes. At the-- Yeah, that right little ooze. First shot. 27 to hit. And that does ten points of damage. And then I'm gonna take another shot at him, I'm going to take a fire shot. And I'm gonna take a negative five to hit. And that's 14. So that's 15 plus-- that's 23 points of damage plus three points of fire damage. Plus fire. Okay. My name in high school. Iceberg Lobsterface. It's what all the kids called me. Long story. Damn it. Get it! Nice! All right. I'm just taking the shot. Taking a shot with the bonus. So that's 14 to hit. That hits. So that's 18 points of damage. And I'm gonna take the other shot. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, the ooze. And that's 13 to hit. And that's 11 points of damage. So I'm going to back up against the wall. I'm going to back to the wall of the-- Yeah. Nice try. Yes, Grog, you killed it good. I'm fine. I feel fine. Seems that there's one table where everyone is perfectly reasonable! I reload. It's probably for the best. I'm gonna be the person who actually examines the cart, at this point. You know, I just figured someone ought to. And it should be me. Put it back on. An investigation check, what is that? Eight. I think-- Well, no. That's the only heat source, that's the only lava there was, and now it's cool. Okay, never mind, then. It's all right, I think it's worth it. I just hear the sounds of ones. At least you get your bear. Except we get Trinket. And we acquired our bear.
