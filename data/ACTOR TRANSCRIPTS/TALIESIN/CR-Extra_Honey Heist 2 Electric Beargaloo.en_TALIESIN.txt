Too real. Look who the cat dragged in. It's true. Well, he certainly sweetened the pot for me. I say we follow, see where this leads. Let's forsake that time for the one more. Here we go. Do I reroll if I got the same thing? I want to keep going. I'm The Brains. Yeah. I know what we're doing. That's noise in your ears. That ain't true. That ain't good. We may need some honey for the road. I know, I'm trying to think of a good haberdashery name for-- what would be a Whitestone haberdashery? Dear god almighty. Nothin' But Hats. (laughter) I imagine you with a spoon, jamming it open. I fail. That's a good idea. Let's do it. With the cart! Grab whatever you can, throw it on the cart. We're out of here! Something with a feather, if you've got it. Let's get out of here! Fail. I'm going to gather the hats and get out of here. It's exactly what you are. I also got a three. I'll take the gray bowler. Yeah. Thank you. There might be a backup plan. Maybe on the outskirts of town there's a place where about three or four nice beehives not too high up in the tree, close enough to a running body of water that we throw it in there, run away really quick and then we go in for a little bit of honey. I fail. I don't remember where it is, but it was very-- Yeah. I was bear, and it was criminal. I didn't run into difficulty. I attempted a flashback, basically. That was actually what I was trying to do. Yeah, that was what I was trying to do. If only we could find those beehives. Oh god, bears can't-- Can bears look up? Maybe that's part of the problem. What he said. They always leave something. I want to rifle through the entire kitchen-- just through everything. I want to go through every drawer, empty it onto the floor, and see what's there. It's not searching. I want to roll the place like a bear. All right. Success. Do I find anything? I was looking for some silverware, maybe some napkins. Who put that in the kitchen. That was such a bad idea. Sweet digs. Cookie. I'm definitely going to try a signature cocktail. I put a honey cake in my hat for later. (cackling) Hey, we've got the AC working again. A little honey for later. Let's head up the trail. We all hop on the drink cart. Wow. I'm going to start by not hammering one of these dicks. Keep hitting until it goes? Oh, good shot. That seems fair, yeah. Nothing you can do about it. Walking the line there. You really got to explain this game better, that's a big problem. Cookie, show them how we break the ice down here. This is a tough call. It's a tough call. Don't know what to do. No. There we are. Ah, there we are! Like that! Like honey. Smooth. More rhythm. I got this. This ain't nothing. Look at that. Don't want to smell the hammer. You grazed a dick. It's you, Cookie. It's all up to you now. I believe in you. The bear's still up! Cookie. Oh no. And we're spent. That got weirder than I could have ever hoped. Don't hammer the dicks, but you got to tap the ice. Nothing more embarrassing. I'll figure it out. I got just the idea. Does this Hattori Bongo have any weaknesses or fears of some kind? Yeah, I know. Thank you. Glad I thought of it. "Woothless?" I need some "wooth." Ruth. His daughter's marrying. Got to keep up. Mister Vinnie the Pooh. We respectfully ask for any information to make this job easier. This is what's making it so weird. How? Couple more cocktails. Are there any interesting centerpieces on the tables, anything of value? Any candles, something like that? So now you're not talking to the fourth wall? Let's take a look around, see if we can find some fireworks, something to start a fire. All right! Succeed! Sweet Baloo, we hit the jackpot. We should pocket some salmon while we're here, too. So either these fireworks aren't going to work, we're going to have to dance in the moonlight or we're just going to have to dance. We should all be prepared to dance. Five digit dance code. I found some explosives. I've already looked for candles. It's a daytime wedding. (groans) We're going to smell for honey. That's a success. We're going to strip the bear. We got the code. So close. They've been flipped. I'm going to walk over, lift the keypad box. I'm thinking! Ah-ah, no. One moment. I'm going to hit salmon. I'm going to hit bamboo. I'm going to hit salmon. I'm going to hit bamb-- I'm going to hit salmon. I'm going to hit bamboo. Gentlemen. We're in. Well I used to be a hacker, to be fair. You never really stop being a hacker. These guys have been collecting wheels! It's looking like enough wheels. It's a good plan. Quincy. Quincy de Bolo, you know? This is a Bolo thing. Quincy! You need to name it. Good Tidings, all right. I'm going to throw my bowler, like a James Bond villain, ninja-style. No, I'm taking the other one. I have honey sense. Roll for criminal. Success. There's more where that came-- There's not more. I had one hat. I'm not sure what to do now. Let's keep one for questioning. We're going to incapacitate this one. A bear hug, I imagine. Where's the honey? How do we get there? Hold on, I have to write this down. Hold on. Okay, left passageway. First right. Second left. Oh, the second right. That's very specific. This is good. I think we're good here. (shushing) Go to sleep. There will be waffles in the morning, go to sleep. (laughter) Shit got dark, man. Never again. I think I'm going to scrape a little honey off the wall and give myself-- I think my muffler is broken. Yakety-yak. Yak yak or something? We could have stopped for something. I got a bit of the flowers. I took a couple of flowers from the-- Well then he's not training you very well then, is he? You get that from the B-90-X? That was amazing. That was a double fail. I feel like that deserves a point in bear. That could be useful. I'm going to tear into a crate. That's a fail. What is this thing? Now it's stuck in the-- So you can use it to send a message or something? Oh yeah, that's a failure. Wow! That's what you get for trying to lift things like you've got thumbs. It's like I was born for it. I'm going to try and smash one more now that I've got-- I'm going to take a ramming run at one of them. That's a failure. Pronounced salmon and bamboo. I'm feeling really frustrated, I just want to run headlong into one more of these crates to see if I can get anything else going. Finally, a success. I was getting pretty frustrated there. Yep. I feel like this door is doing a lot of work to try and not be noticed here. It's strange. I was just about to bring them out. You want the gun, or you want the fireworks? You take the box of fireworks. No, you just throw it in there. It'll be fine. That's the plan. We dare you. Do you have a whiteboard that you can show to explain all about this? Did put a--? You did. You put a ninja mask on a bear. Yeah. This is not my first rodeo. (laughter) It was an accidental misfire. That's not a thing that happens outside of games. There we go. She was threatening me! Ah! I think I've hit him twice. I believe in you! This is what you were born for. I succeed. LIAM, BRIAN, and I'm going to grab the Balootonium and stash it. I got it. Success. I stash it with my-- I got it. That's very fair. That honey is worth five honies. It was Don-- Don Nuts. It's a crash-- TALIESIN and
