The last thing Vox Machina ever sees, immortalized on a shirt. It's the grinning face of our destroyer. We do. It's October, which is wonderful and great. We're going to be covering monsters. We're doing monster books. We're going to be talking about the origins of Groot and some of the big creepy monsters of yesteryear, and some modern creepy monster books. I, Vampire, and etc. Fun. That'll do. Natural 20. 15. 15. This a lot. I'm having a hard time figuring out this damage. This is not cool, dude. I'm at precisely 70 points. Where were you earlier, fucker? No plan survives contact with the enemy. That's the truth. 27. 22, I mean. 22. I'm so sorry. You should've sent the guy in the hallway in first, maybe. I regret nothing. He's wearing it like a bangle from the 80s. We've got to figure out how to get Grog back. I feel a little better. That's all the conversation we can have in one action. No time to respond to that. Yeah. We're all ranged except for-- Remember, you can reroll things, right? She took 100 and-- yeah. All right. The first thing I'm going to do is deal with this skeleton that's right in front of me because there's-- actually, yeah. First thing I'm going to do is deal with this skeleton in front of me and take a slash at him with my sword. So that's-- doesn't matter, does it? 20 to hit? I'm going to do 1d8 plus I'm actually going to burn two points of lightning into this too from Cabal's Ruin. So I'll see what one of that does. That's awful. Eight points of silvered piercing damage plus seven points of lightning damage. 15 did it. That's fine. Next shot, I'm taking the shot with the skeleton that's next to Vex. Yep. And I killed a thing so I get a grit back. That's 30 to hit? All right, I have to switch dice. That's 1d10 plus 1d6 psychic. I'll burn another one point of Cabal into that. 14 points of damage plus five points of psychic and one point of lightning. I get another grit back. And now, where are there other skeletons? Who's getting it? I'm going to take a whack at the one that's right next to Keyleth. Yeah. Yeah but I'm not going to do-- technically is my weapon magical? Okay. So Animus will do. Yeah, but right now I'm better at clearing than anything. I'm not going to be the one who does damage to him. Yeah, let's have a little fun. For my third shot, I'm going to turn on him. First, I'm going to cast Hex. He is necro, disadvantage on intelligence because fuck that guy and I'm going to hit him with Animus. I'm going to drop a point of grit for advantage. Damn it. Well, that will do. 31 to hit? And I'm throwing all of Cabal into it. So that's 1d10, sorry. I'm trying to do this. 1d10. Yes, I know. So that's not bad. 15 points of damage plus six points of psychic damage. And let's drop six points of lightning damage into it. Three, four, five, six. That's not bad. 21 points of lightning damage. Actually, there was one more! I'm so sorry! I forgot to do the necrotic damage on top of that. So with necrotic damage, that's another six points of necrotic damage. Okay. Still what I expected. I'm going to burn an action surge. I'm not going to hit him again because I got no more-- if everything goes well I can do 24 points of damage to him. I'm going to use sharpshooter. Fuck it, let's see if that does anything. I'm going to add sharpshooter. I'm going to burn my last grit for advantage. Let's see if that hits. This is probably not going to hit, is it? That's a six. That's okay. Yeah, probably didn't hit. Yeah, this is really shitty. I can tell. 17 to hit? So I've got two more shots. I'm taking another shot with no advantage. Yeah. 19 to hit? Last shot. That's better. 24 to hit. Just on the cusp. So that's my 1d10 plus my 1d6 plus my other 1d6. Is that right? Yeah. That's 15, 22 points of damage plus five points of psychic damage and two points of necrotic damage. I'm going to break line of sight behind that wall. Just head up there a little bit. About there. Yeah. Actually, still against the wall though. What?! And me? No. You aren't. That would be bad. No, it should be good. Now, really? That was a rough six seconds. He's engaged, by the way, with Bigby's Hand. Got to drop concentration. Someone's got to hit him really hard. Wait. I would be happy to let you take that. I mean, personally I normally would, yeah. Moving on. Oh, thank god! They're such a nice miniature. Which is what? He has disadvantage on it. Intelligence checks. Does that Bigby's Hand vanish with the caster? Well you got a little bit of a fall. It's about 30 feet from where you are right now. That's not bad. That's doable. Yeah, right now, it doesn't matter at all. This is amazing. There's very little of value that I can do right now. So I'm going to-- hmm? Not with my-- Fuck. Yeah, I guess he's within range, so I'm going to burn my bonus. I'm going to use my bonus to reload. I'm going to take my first three shots and I'm going to take out those three skeletons across the way. I know, but it's going to refill my grit so that I have a better chance of hitting him. So first shot. Actually, here, I'll take all three. Actually, no, just in case something terrible happens. That's 20 to hit? Second one is 25 to hit. And the third one is a crit. So I get one back already. And then, let's do 1d10 plus 1d6. First one takes 17 points of damage plus four psychic. Second one takes 12 points of damage plus two psychic. And the other one takes eight-- The other one is fucking toast. I'm getting into twenties here. Not worth it. So that's one grit, two grit, three grit, so I have four grit back. I'm burning my very last action surge now that I have some bloody grit. I'm trying to remember, can I pull Sharpshooter with a grit point, or can I not take Sharpshooter with-- I'm going to take a Sharpshooter plus violent because what else are we going to do? So sharpshooter plus violent shot-- One point for violent because it makes it a gamble. I don't have advantage, I don't know why I'm rolling like I do. Here we go. So with Sharpshooter. Yes! It's a crit! I rolled a 19. So crit on a 19! Which is double dice. Not double psychic, just double damage, right? Yeah. It's just double. So that is that. Oh, man, this is great. So there's that, and then I have the psychic. That's right here, so damage is-- oh, my god-- 11 and then I double that. No, I rolled them twice, so 11, (counting) 48. 1d10, so with violent shot-- It's 2d10, and then I double the d10, plus 18. Now I'm adding the psychic damage. 48 plus nine points of psychic damage. I've got two more shots. And remember that you take half that damage at the end of your next turn. Mm-hmm. So for my next shot, I'm going to burn a point. I wonder if a leg-wing shot would do anything here. All right, I'm going to burn a grit, and I'm not going to do Sharpshooter. I'm just going to take a shot. And that's 24 to hit? And that's 13 points of damage plus four points of psychic. And strength save versus 20? He drops a little bit of-- Well I don't remember. We used to say prone? So I don't know what you would call that. Yeah. Oh, no, but I thought it was like prone if you're standing but 15 feet if you're in the air? All right, that's fair. That was fine. Just for fun, then, let's take one more shot and see what happens. That's a natural 20. It really is. I'm going to die. I'm going to fucking die. He's going to kill me now. Aw, man, I have made a terrible mistake. That's 20 points of damage plus, oh really? 12 points of psychic damage. So 20 points plus 12 which is 32, and his next round, he takes half that as well. Oh, god, I'm not comfortable with that. And I'm taking another ten feet back. I'm starting to back up a little bit, because that was more than I was intending. (breathless) Yes, that ends my turn. That's the only die you ever roll, man. Got to get you up there, man. Never mind, it's not my turn anymore, I can't say anything. Heal people. Or do a-- Yeah! That's clutch. It's cool, next round you can do it. Next round he can leap off you. Wait, what? You got one! I know, I'm freaking out. LIAM and --Me--Ha--Me--! No, it happens to the best of us. I know, this is a lot. I am not. To Grog. Is that right? Okay, so I have advantage from Cabal's Ruin. Not yet. I can wait-- actually, yeah. I'm going to use my reaction, my once per short rest, my spell swallow. I take half damage because I'm swallowing the spell. 66 points of damage? I've got nine charges left on Cabal, baby. No. Is that one legendary action, or two? It's fine. This was not going to last long. Did he take his bleed damage from me? Keep him distracted. He's out of legendaries. This is everything I wanted. You can use mine. Whatever you need. I only have a couple. I have him hexed. I took, how much damage did I take? What is the saving throw? I can't, so that's fine. Mine's gone. It is not a 20. None of us are on these platforms, though. Those are all skeletons. I'm going to take a shot at one of those nasties that have followed them through, since that seems to be a good use of my energy right now. First shot is a 29 to hit. I'm going to, just for fun, drop two Cabal's Ruin in there, for my own amusement. Aw, now I feel bad. 15 points of damage, two points of psychic, and six points of lightning damage to shadowy jerk number one. I'm shoot it again. I'm going to drop a grit for advantage. 27 to hit. I'm not going to drop anything into it, I'm just going to hit him. That's nine points of damage plus two psychic damage. Oh, fine. Then I'm going to target the other one with another grit for advantage. That's cocked. Feels bad, I liked that roll. Yeah, same roll. (counting) 24. All right, and I'm going to drop one, two, three, four, five points of Cabal's Ruin into that one. Drop, motherfucker. Three, four, five. That's ten, 18 points of lightning damage. 13 points of piercing damage, and six points of psychic damage. Fuck's sake. That's everything I've got right now. I'm going to try and scoot around the-- I'm going to get a little further back so I can grab onto that orb if things go shitty. No, he won't die. You've got to trammel him. You can't kill him. Although you can probably hit him with it and not hit Vax. He has one last legendary resistance. He has disadvantage because he's currently under Hex. No, it was your hex. Yeah, your max plus two. That would be amazing. The dragon cage is not concentration, is it? Yes. No! No! Nobody's actually hit him with anything since then. That's a 25 if we get all three in. That's the only thing that gives us a fighting chance. We get all three in, and then we get one round. This is, it's hard to do. We've been hurting him. So that's gone. There would be an effect if it were halved. We would know. You can visually see when someone doesn't take the full damage. He was also connected by a sword to a chain. He's going to throw a boulder at us. He has a third spell? We got hit by meteor again. Fuck me. Fuck, man. Nope. 16. So what's the total? I'm okay. Yeah, that would've been the end of us. Right there. Okay! We've got to start putting some trammels in this guy. 59. You're still up! Oh, let's go! This is on. It's fucking on. Right down there. Is it magic? All right, so I have advantage. Natural 20. Yeah. I can't be paralyzed anyway. Oh yeah, that hits. That also hits. All right, so that's (counting) 22. I'm at 22 hit points. That's fine. I can handle that. Yeah, but he keeps healing-- MARISHA and I'm in melee with this thing? I'm going to take a shot at him with the sword. I'm going to give it a swing. Well this is fine. It's my sword. So it's a 21 to hit. All right, I'm going to drop two points of Cabal's Ruin, or at least one point of Cabal's Ruin. I want to try and end this shit. No, the birds. That's 13 points of damage plus one lightning. Next thing I'm going to do is take a shot at that terrible thing over there. And I'm going to burn a grit for advantage and hopefully get it back by killing it dead. Here we go. Thank god I did, because that was terrible. 25 to hit? And I'm also going to put one more Cabal's Ruin into that, just to put him down. That's 16 points of damage, two points of psychic damage, and two points of lightning damage. For my third action, oh god, I'm going to run down a little bit. I'm going to try and get three of these guys in a line. Just a little bit. I'm going to be one space away. I'm not going around that way, but I'm going to try to back around. I don't want to get too far away, because I'm not done with my movement. I'm trying to get the shot as I run. I'm going to drop a grit for a line shot. Piercing shot. I know. That's a hit. That's 31 to hit. That first one is ten points of damage and three points of psychic. That's 22 to hit, and then dear fucking god. And I get all my grit back. That was 38 to hit. I'm going to run in next to Scanlan and as my bonus action, hand him a superior healing potion. Can I not get quite there? Oh, in that case, if I didn't have time, keep a little closer to the orb. In that case, for my bonus, I'm going to take a healing potion. What is a superior worth? Get some healing and stuff, boy. There are two skeletons. They'll go down quick. Can you put the ball slightly into the ground, or no? He's still Hunter's Marked, which is remarkable. I'm so sorry. I said that out loud. Goddamn it. It's not going to be that bad. No, he doesn't know which of his toys to play with. Scanlan can hold his action. 88. He takes radiant damage when he hits Vex now. Are you okay? That'll do. Strength modifier. That's the end of those skeletons, though. They're about to go away. St. Louis, right? Close your eyes and roll. This got weird. We don't know. The more, the better. She's got a high strength. But we want to try to end the round. I'm going to take a step to my left, and I'm going to drop a grit and I'm going to take a line shot at those two skeletons and make them go the fuck away. That's a 27 to hit. That'll do. 15 points of damage plus five psychic. That's an 18? Okay. And I get my grit back. So I'm now going to back up against the wall. All we can do at this point is take two more shots at Vecna. So I'm going to take another shot. I'm burning some grit for advantage, and I'm taking a sharpshooter shot. Shot number one. Natural 20! That'll hit. And let's double that up. Where's my d10? Where's my d6? That'll do. That's nice. That's (counting) 31 points of damage plus three points of psychic damage, so that's 34, plus he's going to have a bleed next round. And I get a grit back, and I'm burning my other grit for another shot. And yeah, that's another crit! 19. And that's not quite as good, but that'll do. 26 points of damage plus five psychic damage, which he'll also get half of that bleed next round. And I get my grit back. And I'm going to use my bonus to finally reload, because that was everything I had! Got to give a little pressure. Freedom of Movement would not have. 7th-level's something fierce, though. Yeah. I love these. They're cruel, but I love these. But he made his save. Always. So is this a concentration spell? And that's not a concentration spell. I would have gone with the tower. Did he take his half damage from me, by the way, from the crits? That hits. Shut the fuck up. There's been a lot of damage done this round, hasn't there? There's been a reasonable amount. I've got a weird question if I burn a grit point for an arm shot, can I make him drop his hand? If I burn a grit point for an arm shot, can I make him drop his hand? I know it's stitched on-- If I hit it a bunch-- That's fine. I was spit-balling. I'm going to curl around the corner and I'm going to hold my turn for-- who's the last of us to go? I'm going to hold my turn for any spells that he casts, and I'm going to blast him three times the second he casts a spell on anybody. Right after a spell, I'm going to hit him. Man, he's looking way too smug. Is it? I can't feel anything. I take my shots. I'm going to take my shots. Shot number one. Yeah, as long as I've got reaction I knew what I was doing. That would have been 25. These are all sharpshooter, fuck it. No. It's okay. And he just took from me, because I took my shots. It was 26 damage plus one psychic for the first one. Goddamn it. The other one hits, and again, goddamn it. 24 damage plus one psychic. And the third shot probably does not hit. Third shot does not hit. If we're not careful, this gets worse. No. Yeah, we do not want to kill him. This just means we have to live through one roll. I'm holding my action for any movement or anything that he may do. I'm holding my action for signs of life. Next round. So now you can only try and read it. Anybody can try and read it any six seconds as long as it-- What language is it, again? So long as you guys all hold-- Can he do it without arms? Okay, because there's a lot of people grappling him. What! Can't deal. You can inspire yourself. He has healed 50, though, in theory. Yeah. He wasn't like 20 points away. Disadvantage. Huddle in fear at this point. Hi. I'm back there. Come join me. I'm fine. I'm 88. Should be texting that fast. Did we just get janked? We just got robbed! It's hard to get out of here, isn't it? Okay, that just happened. What. Holy fuck, man. Wow. Yeah, it is late. Okay, that could have gone real bad. Yeah, nope. It's so late. Love you. Oh yeah. Oh, we ain't done. Thank you, Blindspot. Oh my god.
