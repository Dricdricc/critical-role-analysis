I like it. I like it. Or you can, if you follow Geek and Sundry on Spotify, you can find all of our Spotify playlists on there. I'm here to ruin everything. Yeah, you should read our notes. We have liner notes. I have sideburns! I'm a little scruffy. I've seen some shit. It's down and to our left. It's underneath the tables. I'm not in it. BlizzCon, oh yeah. Okay, you're getting there. So many Critters. Nice to see you. Yeah. With little toadstools. Oh god. Yeah! I forgot about that! You've made it. We've got work to do. I know; it's crazy. Like a comic strip. Like a Doonesbury, so you get little segments that all lead up into a larger thing. She's going to be telling the story of our very first winter festival, which is-- should we tell them is also mixed with other events in Critical Role history? You'll see. It be fabulous. Go check it out because the more people who check it out, the more likely they are to say, "This deserves to be an entire comic book." With animation and craziness and hyperlinks and all sorts of things. It's like falling off a bicycle; it's easy. We are still running. Whoa, triple digits. Ditto. I'm climbing the wall. I'm just going to hold and anybody who gets too close-- I'm just going to take a shot at anything that gets too close. Can I see any giants from up there? I rolled a perception of ten. Whoa. I'm reaching down to help her up on the top of the wall. You look so thin! I'm taking a shot. I Percy'd. I didn't Wheaton, come on. I Percy'd. That's a 20. It must be. Oh, it's hollow! Nine. 15 points of damage. Whatever you're going to do, do it! I'm firing again. 24. 24. 11 points of damage. Firing one more time at it! That hit. 15, 27. Seven points of damage. Wow. 16. Yeah, you are! Thank you for the translation. Roll. This is going to go so poorly. Up yours, Harryhausen! It looks great. Fist full of crumpets. Mister Cobblemitts, I do declare. Have to have a conversation soon. 17. Yennan! Can you hold until morning? We'll do what we can. Give you a big hug. We meet to the west! We're going east, but we meet to the west when we're finished. Listen to your ears. Once we get back to the western wall, we'll be able to hear each other. Oh god. Oh, the thingie? Kill it with fire. I was about to say, the guard is there. Matted with jam. Check the body for secrets. Hey, Vax? Oh, you're gone. You have an earring, though. If he's on his ass, you have a better chance of hitting him, correct? Good to know. I am a monster. I am a monster! I have really high initiative. Oh, I'm sorry. 26. This is going to be hilarious. I'm going to do something I've never done before. Pull out Bad News. I'm going to take aim, and I'm going to wait for it to raise its club hand up. It's holding a club? It's a very large morningstar? Drop that. I'm going to have him drop the morningstar. Aimed shot. Thankfully, it's got shitty AC. 16? Drop it. Next shot, I'm taking a sharpshooter shot. I'm reloading. Taking a sharpshooter shot. 15? And this is also an aimed shot. Sorry, I spent another grit. So sorry for not saying that. I'll do my damage and then tell you. It was an aimed shot to the legs, so that's-- oh my god. 16, 26, 32 points of damage, and it needs to make a constitution saving throw. Oh my god, this is insane. DC equals eight plus your proficiency modifier plus your dexterity modifier? Proficiency modifier is four, dexterity modifier is-- Yeah, 18. That's okay. I still did a ton of damage. Oh, that hits. Just strength saving throw? No, I rolled a one. How much damage did it do to me? 28? I believe in you. Yeah, Legolas. Guards. Would you like to borrow my die and see if it does anything? It's hollow. I'm pinned and annoyed. I'm shooting him in the face. Am I prone? Okay, can I use my movement to get up? (grunts) I get up, shake it off, pull up for another shot. Shooting at his face. I'm reloading, shooting at his face. Bad News. I'm doing the same thing I was doing before, so that's eight plus seven. 15 to hit? 15 hits, so that's... ugh. That's 20 points of damage. And now he has disadvantage on his attacks for the next round. Yeah. And just because I'm feeling like a jerk, I'm burning an action surge. Forget it. Reloading-- oh, I've actually-- No, it's a short rest. I checked. I'm being good. That's 11. That hits. I'm out of grit points. 32 points of damage. Reload, fire again. That also hits. 14, 24, 30 points of damage. And now I'm going to use my bonus action to heal. Heal myself. That's 19 points healed. Disadvantage. Putting the guns away and walking over to the guards, as well. Tomorrow at dawn, we take the castle. Spread the word. You're literally going to steal from my great-grandfather? All right. I'm going to check my family grave. The family crypt. Oh, that's right! I know the city well enough to take us through a relatively-- Well... Honestly, if Pike weren't here, I'd say fine, but... (sighs) How do you think I am, Pike? (sighs) There's a secret entrance to the castle to the west, in the woods. I think perhaps if we made our way there, we could-- Camp out, perhaps. It would be a roof over our heads if we got there, and we could take care of anyone-- I'm not allergic to cats. Let's make our way to somewhere quiet. 15 with disadvantage. Clang, clang, clang. Do I know what this sound is? I don't think I've ever rolled that before. 14. 16? It should be around here. Does this look familiar to me? I think this might be it. I don't think they're expecting anyone from here. Abandoned. Pike, can you take a look at this cough before we take a rest? How many spells do you have left? I think we should take a rest. I don't know. I've had a cough, and I'm... complicated. No. (sighs) No. Did I heal, as well? I do feel better. Should I randomize which corruption point vanishes? Oh, it's compounding. I feel better. I feel more like myself. (coughs) I'm still coughing, but I feel much better. Thank you. It could be. I'm not quite finished yet. We'll see where we are tomorrow. I'm going to take care of a little business outside, and then we'll seal up the opening. I'm going to charge the Diplomacy glove. Grog already sealed it? We can't do it in here because it would make too much noise. I'm sleeping. (groans) Yes? I don't know if I can do both of those things, but okay. Yes? I don't know anything about this thing, except that this last time... this last time was different than the first time. This last time didn't... (sighs) This last time, I felt more like me, and less like I was being drawn somewhere. I wasn't entirely me, but it's hard to describe. I felt like I had contained it, a bit. I feel like, maybe, maybe I can keep it under check. I don't know. I would expect no less. Vax? I have a sister! I'm hoping. I shall. No, I'm running really low. No. No. Oh, god. Yes. I'm going to sleep before this happens. 22. Once we're inside the castle, we'll be able to-- Not even wait a while. We'll go in. Well, we had a Grog. Let's see if we can keep civilian casualties to a reasonably small amount. No. I think it's going to take all of us to defeat the Briarwoods. Once the Briarwoods are gone, I think a lot of this will get a lot easier. Wisdom advantage. Nice! (sighs) To Whitestone. Do I recognize this part of the passage? Please defeat this door. Doors of Whitestone. Curse you, doors! Let's all push. I'll join. 12. I could have done that. Well, fine. I could probably confirm this. This is absolutely the dungeon. I would like to start making my way in that direction. I'm being stealthy. 21. I'm heading towards whichever cell had been mine. The left path. Shh. I would say it's almost safer for her down here for now. No. I know all of them. I did live here. No, because that's a spell. They were going to feed her to something. We'll be back. There are things upstairs that we can't protect you from that we are going to deal with first. There is war outside right now. Damn, Grog. (whispering) Let's check the other side. Let's check the other side. Yay, map. Let's memorize where we're all going to die. Old people love us. Oh my god. So what time is it there right now? Love you so much. Bye, darling! And your Spotify went up today. What? On the Twitters.
