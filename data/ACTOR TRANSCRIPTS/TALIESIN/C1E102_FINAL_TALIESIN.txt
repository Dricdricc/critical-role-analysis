Yeah, we've got something special planned, but I don't know if it's official yet, but I think that we are going to be celebrating Pride Month, and we may have a special guest. I can't say for sure, but we're going to be talking. It's Stan Lee. He's coming out on our show. He and his pansexual adventures throughout comicdom. Excelsior. It's going to be fun. It'll be a thing. Possible special guest. It's really pleasing in the hand, isn't it? Should we mention that we had to reprint some character sheets, or are we not mentioning that? I've now said it online. Old enough to get in trouble for drinking. Extras from a bad zombie video. I think it's got a range. Stay tight. Stay on the ground. I think they probably know we're here. I think they probably know we're coming. I think let's just trepidatiously make our way a little closer, see what else is in this town, see if maybe there's anything useful. Let's not blow anything up yet. Making our way towards the tower, in a towerly direction. No. I'm not. I'm all right with mine. I'm 20 points down. I don't mind being 20 points down. Let's get a little closer, then, and survey the situation, and then take a break. I feel like we're a bit far. If we run into something on the way there, though, I don't want to be at peak performance yet. This is going to be fun. So let's take advantage of this. We can do robes. I'm all right with robes. I'll take a robe. I'll take a robe with the censer. Yes, I'm carrying the censer. Yes. Thank you. That's not bad. 21. Is there a nonchalant way of maintaining direction but getting out of its way? Way to be Fonzies. Lot of Fonzies. Smells terrible. Do any of the buildings look remarkable or interesting? I'm trying to keep an eye out for any building that may have anything inside it of vague importance. Either the building itself is slightly more interesting, or it looks like maybe someone has boarded something up to try and maintain some kind of vigil against the darkness? I'm not entirely sure. Out of the ordinary. I knew you were going to say that. I'm not good at this. Nope. Nope, nope. That's a four. That's a natural one. Some of them have doors. Holes where windows might be. I felt Orthax take over again. Free range undead. I'll guide us towards something. Roll like it's a stealth roll. And they don't even have bowels. I go in last. Censer. Yours. I'm going to use the broken tables and swords to barricade the front windows or holes, I'm not sure which they are, but I'm going to barricade them. And the door, use the sword to jam the door shut. Do you want to see what they're burning in the censer? I'm going to open up the censer. Medium pace? Thank God we still have a thing. 21. Yeah. 22, I mean. We did not roll well. But we're fine. I'm showing Keyleth what's inside the censer. I'm going to give some of the herbs to Keyleth to examine. It's like on a charcoal? Comes in green and red, available in the Resident Evil universe. The resin's the best part. Whatever the opposite of standards are, I know we have them. We would probably have to dismantle a bunch of them. I feel like it would be easier to wreck the operator than try to break the machine. Which crystal? We can go over it. We do have a magic carpet. That would be the question. It's A, where do we come up? B, how do we tunnel without collapsing a building on us? And C, what if there's buried dead that haven't been able to break? If we can tunnel under the wall and then come up in a building. You look smaller than you are. You would be a little zombie, floating, stuck. It's like butter. We are stealthed. We've got to get through the wall. He's making eye contact and rolling a die, like it means something. Or maybe there are birds on the other side of the wall. And then we can ride him! Well, that went well. Can we ride him to the tower? Next time. It will hardly matter. Actually, maybe if we ask Mr. Mistoffelees-- I'm going to never get tired of saying that!-- to go up to the tower, greet whoever's up there, and throw them off. Just go up there and cause havoc. No, we can just send him up there, and then we can head in through the tower. He can just be a problem. Just say, go up there and if there's anything living up there, throw it off. Yes, all of us. Yes, it's just you. I say we head in closer on foot. If you want to ride Mr. Mistoffelees up to the top of the tower, that's one thing. But I think just sending him up there, or sending him to be an agent of chaos. You could always get swallowed. I get the distinct impression we're going to have options before this day is over. Well, we're going in now, aren't we? I don't think you can call it a blink if you've got one eye. I think it's just a wink. I am excited by this plan. I think that's a yes. Drop it! Drop it! The city is mostly stone; I don't know if we can burn it down. That's the little chunk where the joint is. It's just this little bit, it just breaks naturally if you put pressure on that side. (laughs) Wow! Way to bring that back! We've got a little shadow creature coming back around in a moment. You guys do the scout, we'll heal? It was like Carpentry of the Damned sort of thing. It might, but it might just do the (buzzing, exploding). It's magic, it's the best I've got. I could use 20 points. We're taking a short rest; I can add my-- You have advantage, though, on everything. 14. However... How much longer do they have? Attack the tower. Tell it to attack the tower. Maybe we can mess one person up. If you rolled low enough, he'd be like, "You don't know." Seattle! You've taken us to Seattle! Let's head to the base. The less people we're fighting, the worse it is. It might be four. We kind of figured out what it was. It was a modified version of a spell we've seen before. Oh, if we could maybe bring the top down here? How big around is the tower? He's looking at the tower. Can I do a little engineering? If I were going to punch at it... I think whatever was going on up there is gone. I think it's happened. That's fair. She's not what I'm afraid of. Damn it. It's a ten-minute walk. I don't know. I don't think we're going to bring it down. It may just hover there if we knock this. It may be keeping the ground up as opposed to being sitting on the ground at that point. Or walk up through the inside. Yes, damn it. They're dressed for an occasion. Fuck it. Just go. We have one broom, we don't have two brooms anymore. We got a carpet, and we got wings. Throw everything off the top. Break everything. Smash everything. You can? All right, this is almost a plan. Let's do this. It's far more. Let's make our way to the tower and maybe head up through the tower. We don't have to necessarily fly up to the top. I can take 50 points of damage. I can take two earthquakes, personally. All right! All right, let's do it. Let's bring the tower down to us. I say the movers and shakers get the cloaks. Let's head out. And we keep them safe. We are playing defense. God, I hope this works, too. We're distance. Anybody gets near them, we take them out. We're going to focus everything on one side of the tower, we're going to try and bring it down in a direction. Here we go. Like a tree. Let's do this. This is a terrible plan. All right. LAURA Just trying to gauge Matt. Matt's thinking about all the other people he could be playing D&D with right now. (laughing) Keyleth's got a cloak. Pike's got a cloak. He's huge. Well, we can look like cultists. Can you shift what we look like without changing it? "The dread Pirate Roberts is here for your souls!" It's gone from exalted to shamed. Never happens. This never happens. We are a bunch of assholes. And remember, if anyone looks at you, close one eye. Just be winking. Always be winking. Left eye. What are you going to do after? Surely you've thought. So are we close enough now that we can start this? I'm going to see if there's any structures that are within distance so that once they set up and start, I can get to them. Maybe we can perch. We can cover you from a roof. 15. Please. Now, now! To the end. Yeah, let's just pretend that's not really happening. I pull Silence. Fuck. Broom. Let's do this. The minute I grab onto your broom, you can't hear anything, so I'm just going to ride it down to the ground and then let go. Powerhouses together. Distance fighters keep their distance. I'll take the carpet if it's available. I'm going to grab the carpet. Anybody who wants a lift up, feel free. Carpet's full. I was about to say, carpet's a bit full. Once I'm up, I'm going to scatter. How long can you maintain a beholder? Oh, then wait until the moment that it's necessary. That is true. So they're not platform-y. I'm hiding behind this glowing spire. I'm going to take some cover behind. I haven't seen them in so long. Who's left? Pike? No, I was on the carpet and hopped and left them because they had to go pick up. No, they had to go get Scanlan-- It's 35 feet. Okay, that'll work. If you'd be so kind, throw me here, then. I like that you found a goofy-looking beholder. (goofy voice) Hi! ASHLEY and Oh, balls. I don't like it being this close. That's terrible. That's terrible. I'm not okay with that roll. Back page. You have to roll. It's a dex modifier plus a d20 if you don't have initiative? Your initiative is normal. Plus a d20. I don't think you've burned since we've come through. 13. They did not see this shit coming. At all. It did, but I think that probably made a lot of cultists go away. I cast Game Over. 20th-level spell. Fuck you. Do you have a Luck? No, you have all of your other stuff. Oh, you didn't say me. Until we save, or until his concentration is broken, I assume. Actually, isn't it just naturally wherever they're looking? Oh, okay. I was under the impression that the eyeball was passive. You're holding your action for being able to move. It could be worse, but it would take math. This is bad. He has been grooming us and fattening us up for two years. Leroy! Oh man, I am not-- This does not feel good. I have a plan. I have a plan. Yeah. 20. I have advantage also, against-- Do you have resistance to any of that? Well, they're top-loading. They're top-loading. Oh, thank you! Oh, it's on! You've got a Death Knight, if you're feeling frisky. I'm going to scoot against the wall towards myself as far as a reasonable amount of movement will take me because I don't like clumping. I'm going to take aim at the asshole in the sky, and let's do a couple of things. I'm going to take Bad News out, and just to keep everything reasonable, I'm going to burn a point for dead-eye, and I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot on him. Minus five to the attack. That's a crit! That's a crit. At level 18, that's a crit. This is with Bad News, so that's going to be 2d12. That's going to be 4d12 plus six. Bad News. I don't know if this also doubles-- I don't think it does-- but I'm pouring all of Cabal's Ruin into this shit, too. Oh, really? Yeah, I burned a crit. The grit's not burned, so that's nice. These don't double, do they? Does my other rule also apply to this? Does this add to bleed damage now? Maybe not. It's an outside factor. That's fine. I'm with you. Okay. (counting) 32. That's 32. 36 points of damage, times two. 72 points of electrical damage, and then he's also going to get a bleed of 31. No, he's going to get a bleed of 15. But he still has to roll concentration. I'll take it, and goodbye, Cabal. I'll gain more when he hits me with some magic shit. God fucking damn it! Damn it. I was debating whether or not to hit him with Hex, and now I'm so sad I didn't. Oh, well. That's okay. I'm reloading, and I'm going to take another Bad News shot at Delilah. Where is she? What is she doing? Okay. Let's burn that little bit of Animus again and burn that grit point again for advantage. Let's hit her with Bad News. Actually, I'll cast... Hex on her, as well, just for fun. And give her constitution disadvantage. Actually, let's give her, just in case she gets grappled-- let's make it constitution disadvantage. Fuck it. And then I've got bonus, and I'm doing sharpshooter again. Thank god I did because that was a terrible shot. That's 14. We don't. Oh, that would definitely hit, I'd imagine. Not bad. That's (counting) 20 points of piercing damage and five points of necrotic damage. That's my roll. Shit. Vecna's been busy. Okay. This is going to get interesting. That's all I can do. Either one. They're both good. Go for the first one. Pick one. Hit her with a mind bullet. That's me under the effects of being confused about the Confusion spell. What do you have for a bonus? Yeah, can we attack her? We were talking about how much you wanted a monologue. I really feel like this is the moment. That's the end of Vax. I'm looking at it. That's a small-- that's a dire armadillo. That's okay. Burn. Sick burn. Can he do that with concentration? What? This is not going well. Oh shit. Wow, you really went down. I don't know what to do. Wow. You are a terrible person. Oh no. You can't dex out of something if you can't move. Oh man, this does not feel good. It does not feel good. Oh god! Hit her with a stick. Turn her to fucking paste. Well, that, and those drinks were really inappropriate. You can just do it. Is that three more attacks? Trinket can. He's about to be in a pocket dimension really quick. Not cool. No. God fucking damn it. Okay, that's good! We'll find out. We'll just lay waste to shit until it stops happening. We're going to keep doing terrible shit until terrible shit stops happening. This is very much the beach, isn't it? Feet are passe. I've got nothing. I'm going to unload a few rounds of Animus into Delilah, since she's still standing. She's still standing? All right. Let's drop a point of grit, and let's get some advantage on this for Animus shot number one. Come on, crit. Not a crit, but still pretty decent. That's a 28 to hit? That's not the full damage. Let's do this, plus let's do that. That's 12 points of piercing damage, five points of psychic damage, and four points of necrotic damage. I know. I'll keep that off, then, for now. All right, let's take another shot. Same thing, burning a grit because fuck it. And let's make this one-- these are not the right dice to roll. I'm really nervous. Let's make this one a sharpshooter to see if we can pour a little more pain. Natural 20. That's a crit. Let's get that grit back. I've got to use my pen! Don't shake me! I shake so much on my own! That's 2d10 plus 2d6 psychic, so that's four points of psychic damage. That was a terrible roll. And 24 points of damage. Yeah, that's doubled. It was terrible. (sighs) I take my second shot. I call, Delilah? Even if we die, it's fucking worth it. And I take it right in her good eye. I want me to be the last thing she sees. But it's down. Off. (sighs) For my third shot, Mr. Armor. And I get another grit back because she's dead. Armor. I'm taking-- what's he holding? He's holding a longsword? Let's get rid of that longsword. I'm going to hit him and make him drop that longsword. I'm burning a grit to make him drop it. I know, this is a lot. I'm taking my third shot with Animus, and this is going to be a sharpshooter shot, and that's not a crit, but that's pretty good. That's 29 to hit? All right, so this is 1d10 plus 1d6. That's terrible. That's 20 points of damage, two points of psychic damage, and he has to make a strength saving throw or he drops his sword. DC 20. Concentration? Oh, for that. That's fine. Just because we're at that point where I'm panicking, let's burn an action surge. Boom. Three more shots on the asshole. No, Vecna I'm not shooting because he's laughing off my bullets. And that's-- oh my fucking god! 20 points of damage, plus one point of psychic damage. Burning another-- I've got more. I've got three more. I keep killing things. That's 17 to hit? Did he make a constitution save against the last one? Okay. This is my last shot. I'm burning another grit, and natural 20. Okay, so that's going to be-- come on. That's better! Yes, he did. He took 15 points of extra damage, halved. 18, 21, 22, 23, 30 points of damage, plus five psychic damage, and he's going to take 15 points of damage, plus three psychic damage next round. Oh my fucking god! I'm going to use my bonus action to reload, and that's my fucking turn. I know. No. There's nowhere. I'm as far away from everybody as I can currently be. There's nowhere else. Delilah's down. You know what? I'm going to start making a beeline straight for Keyleth. Fuck it. I'm going to see if I can get some cover behind-- I'm fucking bailing. We can get Grog back. We've just got to get everybody up. We're picking up armor. Revivify. We will grab everything we fucking can. This is no time for allergies. Fuck! I got as far as I could. You need healing like a mother. Don't shrug at me. It doesn't matter anymore. I haven't touched that game in so long. You'd have to pick one of the two of them to hit. You can hit them both. There's a lot of dead bodies on the ground, man. That will do. I get that vibe. Roll a one! You're a liar. You're a lying liar. He would have-- None of us want this. Taryon's sitting with a cup of tea. We've got one way down. We are all having the thumpa-thumpa right now. You're terrible. No. Stop rolling that die. It really was a one. No, you can't. Hello? Fuck! One more round. There's nothing we can do right now. How close to you do we have to be? They're bullshit. We don't care. That is my armor class. I don't even acknowledge its existence. I am definitely not amused. Where is your dad from? Damn it. That's bad. Do you have a reaction? 27. Scanlan's getting whaled on. If we're smart-- I'm heading towards where you are. I'm heading towards the deceased body of Delilah. She can move to us. Never mind. I'm going to be making a beeline for everybody else. Everybody's in that big clump. You'll be able to move before you cast Plane Shift, right? So as long as we're all touching, she can get to us. We just need to clump, and I move last, so I'm fine. Is that right? Yeah, I move last. Doesn't matter. She just gets extra points-- Come on. We're in a nice little clump, aren't we? I think we're all in physical contact, at this point, except for me. Well... Working on it. Do you have all of his stuff? Next time we fight Vecna, he's going to be wearing some very nice boots. I'm kidding. We are trying to get out of here. We're going to die here. As long as we're all touching, it doesn't matter where Keyleth is, but Turn Undead would help, maybe? Healing or Turn Undead. I'm coming up, right? I'm going to use the ring of counting. This is actually proving to be invaluable. Later. We need a bigger boat. Not yet. Yeah, we just got 26 points back. She's probably at the bottom. Nope. Which also means that all the fucking skeletons take damage! I was about to say, I know the stats of the Dawnmartyr really well right now, for reasons. Yep. Are we a reasonable chain? There's nobody breaking the chain? I'm going to move six points in the direction of Delilah because I'm going to bring her with me because I don't want that dead body there. Do I make it in six moves? And while I'm running, just for fucking fun, I'm going to take three shots at that armor, and I'm going to push him the fuck back, if that's okay. I'm going to push that knight back. I'm going to try and do a force push. Yeah. It's about to be. We're all touching. Let's get rid of that fucker. We're getting the fuck out of here. That's a 27 to hit? The knight. Okay, and that's a torso push. I'm only going to take the one shot. I don't even care anymore; I'm just pushing him away. He's pushed ten feet back from my position. There's no save for that, and then he takes a disturbingly sad nine points of damage, plus six points psychic damage. But he's ten feet back. We're all touching. I'm going to save the rest of my attack for anybody who tries to get in the way of this shit. If anybody interrupts us, I've got two more shots ready to go. Also burning a heal for fun, as well. I'm also holding onto Delilah. Yay! I'm not quite at full. Put your hands in it. We're ready to burn. Fuck no! You have a reaction. There's no save. This is it. We're all here. We're dying. Roll. You're a good man. We're not happy yet. That's not nice. Nothing feels good. No, there was not a fucking prayer. You know what, I'm grateful that we're not--
