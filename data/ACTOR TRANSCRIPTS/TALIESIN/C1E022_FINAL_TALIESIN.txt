We'll see if I feel better. No, feeling better. It's right there. Salt the earth. Not everybody. MATT and That's coming to my house. It's going to my house, right there. Ow, ow! (pained) No, it's very nice to see you too, ow. Ow! Does that mean they're not skilled? Can I use my passive perception? He had a point. I'm last. Well, Grog says I'm right in front of him. That wasn't me! It might've been me. Not really, no. And we're locked in. Religion check? (splutters) I'd have liked some warning. Oh, I think she is. Very happy. No, that's impressive, too. You, you strike me as married, yes. Yes? (stutters) Well, I may have-- Almost died. Well, not fire actually, but ice. Another ice dragon. You're more married than him. I've never met a dwarf that wasn't surly. She's blushing. It was a shame we didn't have it. It would have come in so handy for our adventure. This story will be great if we could see the carpet, I think. Well, you cleaned it, and that's nice. We slept in a tent! We slept in a tent in the woods with the loudest librarian on god's green earth! She talked in her sleep! This is what happens when you de-enchant the carpet. Yes. Quite charming. I could send him to the blacksmith I went to. A pet store? At the blacksmith's? It's an old god; you've probably never heard of it. Oh, I see how this could work out poorly. We're shopping for potions. Excuse me. I'm looking for potions. Can I get some service? We've already got one. (stutters) How much was that? Is it a superior healing potion? I'm not spending 500 gold on a greater healing potion. Why do they not make that? Some people need iron. (whispering) What would Vex do? (whispering) Thank you. Ugh! Ugh! We're getting you a leash! So I've just been sitting here watching this, shocked? I was upset about the carpet, and I wasn't-- he's huge! What was I going to say? No, I didn't. It was expensive and-- oh god. So it's credit, there's credit. It'd be expensive, though. It's somebody's time for a week. You're going to do great! [break] That's funny. It took a second. I don't think it's supposed to make that noise. Yes, it sounds lovely. What's the worst that could happen? Oh, never mind. That was rhetorical. Don't actually want to know what the worst that could happen would be. It's happening. There's nothing you can do to stop this anymore. Embrace the inevitable. We could make a compass if we really needed one. It's not hard to make a compass. We had two extra horses. You can ride the bear. Let's bed down. It's not like we don't have to sleep eventually. I'm going to try and cast some more ammunition, since I'm out. God damn it. 14. I was getting a little iffy. I can use metal. They're basically made of iron, so honestly I don't know. Yeah. I knew I would just get a little bit on the road right now. Five shots. That sounds about enough. Do I get an up to my hit points at level 11? Do I get to roll more hit points at level 11? I haven't done anything other than take my new abilities. Roll a d10? Yeah, that happened. That's ten. I'm up ten points. Hit points. I rolled an eight, and my constitution modifier is two. Yes, I am. What do we get? No, I was there. I was with you. Right here, on camera. (sputtering, laughing) There's, like, five jokes I'm not making right now. Let's get a move on, I think. 17. Oh look, we have two options for our ways up. Two paths. I want to examine the path to see if there's one that's been more trod. That won't make much of a difference. 14. Are the prints going both directions, or is there a majority going one or the other? Footprints, horse prints, both? No horse prints. I see the path is probably too treacherous to bring the horses. We might want to leave them here. One path has barely been touched, the other one has been pretty well ridden through. I say we take the more common path. 13. I've got a mask for this. I'm going to put on the mask. 11. Don't say things like that out loud. I think so. 16 18. Is the entity still lifting boulders? Okay, I'm going to stop, if I see one pick up a ball, I'm going to stop and take an action, if that's okay. I'm going to swing around, I'm going to pull Bad News out as I swing around, back myself down, and I'm taking an aimed shot at its arm. Spending a grit point. It's been so long. There we are. Yeah! Oh, the curse is broken, that's 29, 31. 31. The arm shot is-- okay, sorry. It's been a while. I've never done this one before. No damage, but it drops one item of my choice. And I use the strength of the shot to pick myself up and keep on running. 23. That felt really good. 15. Yeah. Yes. We face this together. 19. 17. My mask doesn't give me any advantage, does it? 11. Oh, sweet baby Jesus. Does this make you feel better? God damn it, Wheaton. No, it's going. Crickets. Crickets have 25 to 20. Nine. We're sitting here like, is this a Cirque du Soleil thing? We have immunity to what, now? That's better. 15. How many points? I like the comma there. The comma really brought it together. That misses. 25 definitely hits. I am on fire, aren't I? God damn it. And it takes an entire action to put myself out? Can I run? He's going to get an attack of opportunity on me. Yeah, I know. Fuck it. I'm going to run first, and then put myself out. I'm running towards the wall. I'm getting some distance. Yeah, and I'm doing a "stop, drop and roll" on my way to put myself out. Damn it! Okay. And you've moved me as far in that direction as I can go, right? Yeah. I'm also going to spend my bonus action for second wind, because fuck. So that's 19 points that I gain back. We all look great and lose five pounds. Hey, now. Not cool. That's pretty good. (singing) Oh, that girl is smoking on fire-- You first or me first? No, I put myself out. Take that soda can pop-topper off me. Okay, I'm pulling out the Pepperbox and I'm taking an ice shot at the little one attacking Pike. And I'm going to take a sharpshooter-- that's the wrong dice to roll. I'm going to take a sharpshooter bonus for it, so that's a miss. That's a nine. Actually, no. Shit. God damn it, that's a misfire. I'm going to spend an action to fix that. Oh, what is the check on that? That's a DC 12. Eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. I hit my check. Fire again. No, I looked. It takes an attack. If it goes, then I'm-- Yeah. Action to fix a broken gun. Let's try it again without the sharpshooter bonus. Better! 20 to hit. And I don't get the bonus on that because I suck. Seven points of damage. Rolled a one. And I'm going to back off. It is an action? I thought it was an action to-- It did break. I would have switched guns, anyways, but okay, next time. For some reason I thought it was an attack action. To fix it, okay. That's fine; it was shitty damage anyways. Hey, I get to keep the bullet. I'm fine. I'm at half. I'm at 56. That was full road runner. Can he do a one-space move without an attack? It's a what? It's a 19? I'm going to spend a grit point and say that doesn't hit. Yep, I'm going to Gunslinger's dodge. I'm going to unload into its body. I know I'm at a disadvantage because I'm that close, but I'm just going to unload into its body. Three attacks with disadvantage. That was a 17, but it's okay, because I have disadvantage, so that's a 21. 17. 26. ORION and 18, plus 23, 26. 35 points of damage. Yes. Constitution check. Okay! 21. Yes! 21. Can I use my saving throw reroll that I get? It's a skill check? Damn it. Okay. 12. 33. Bravo! Water would be lovely. Would it enchant anything in animal form? Oh, and if you're in Denver I will be at-- is it Nan Desu Kan? I'm blanking. I'll be in Denver at Nan Desu Kan, so you can go see me in Denver.
