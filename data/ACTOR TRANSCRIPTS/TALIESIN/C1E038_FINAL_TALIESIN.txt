Have you never been to Casa Bonita? I would say you're in for a treat, but it's so much more than that. That's not mine. You should totally put some stuff up there. You really should. It's like a Tom Waits song. It's an unconscious corpse. Which means it's technically-- MARISHA and We're Reservoir Dogging it. Walking really slow. The bear we left in the alley. The bear is a necessity. (groaning) It's like an ad for Atmos Surround, you hear (ticking noises). Oh my god. Nothing can go wrong. This is a great idea. She can do this. We would like to deliver this personally as we don't know if he has any co-conspirators, so it would be best if he didn't leave our immediate vicinity. Vex, this is all yours. I've wanted to make this pun my entire life. He taint intimidated. Got to get it out of my system. I'm so sorry. I've seen her regrow a foot. It's amazing. It worked for me. It was really quite an experience. That's a big hand to get in there, man. That's really uncomfortable. Just keep it clean so we can burn everything afterwards. Quiet happy time. Really quickly, have we looted the body already? Good evening, your lordship. A lot could happen. I'm all right with that. Let's do faithful. Let's start a pub crawl. TALIESIN and I feel so much better for every terrible thing I've said. Oh my god. You get a 1d10 bonus against a roll versus him. It's to knock him down a peg. Am I heading the pub crawl? All right. I'm walking in a direction. All right. I'm going to use a different die because it's funnier that way. That's an eight. Scanlan? Scanlan? I feel we need you. I'm still recovering my spirit here. It couldn't hurt. It's like, "Fine. We're doing a pub crawl." Or poorly recommended. Textiles and beer? Okay. I'm going to find the most interesting, boisterous clientele in the bar and I'm going to approach them. No. Thank you for that. Yes! That's much better. 20. Really turning around. Really turning around. Another for her as well. I'm listening in. Pike, I don't know where you are, but I assume you're still-- I was going to encourage. No. I'm going to encourage this now. I think this is a great idea. Let it happen. We're all going to learn a valuable lesson. Do we get a constitution bonus from the Heroes' Feast? Oh, wow! 16. 20. I'm so sorry, 20. We've got her. We've got her. If you want to hang by the textile, I've taken her all the way out. This should be fun. All right, go! Oh, not on the jacket! It's okay. I know. You'll be even sorrier in the morning. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. Oh, yes. You can't divine the sad out of alcohol. I don't think that works. That's such a dick question to ask. Yes, but let's do this anyway. This was a while ago. Perhaps we should at least take a look to see if there was something else down there that was dangerous. You humble us all by comparison. We can also put some beds out in the workshop which has now been vacated. I shove Keyleth into her room. Good night. Damn! What is 'our kind' supposed to mean? Did you hear that, Pike? You had a very good time. And then we planned to investigate a house and possibly pilfer. We're going to investigate a house. Possibly. Pilfer. Yes. Last time we were there, things attacked us, so we're going to double-check. Mysterious things have been happening, though. Nothing. We-- We agreed to take a look inside this house and if there was anything valuable we would liberate it. That's very fair. I'll make sure you see a sunrise. Now come on. We need you with us anyway. To keep us honest. We should take a look. The faster we do this, the faster they leave, at the very least. It'll be fine. We'll explain it on the way. Trinket's coming. Yes. A wise bear. I think we're already on our way, aren't we? And the new owner has also left in a hurry. It's tough being the good one. Just skate over that one. 16. Are there any guards that we can see right now? If we come across a guard, I'd be happy to inform them of what we're doing. Grog, that rhymed! Well done! Walking to the front gate. I'm coming in. The trap room, the little portal in it. Let's find the source of the smell. Oof, I throw the gas mask on. Let's search the upstairs first, see if there's a body or otherwise. Compost it? We've all got earrings, let's start checking rooms and we'll get to the room that we know is iffy last. Yes. I'm going to start upstairs, check the bedrooms. Yes. Sure. We should remind everyone you are immune to poison, you are immune to cursed, you've got a bonus on wisdom saving throws, and plus 1d10 temporary hitpoints. Curse. 24. Full on Ghostbuster-ing. Don't mime, don't mime. Gently checking for traps as we go up the stairs. Natural 20. Interesting. Wow, you paint a picture there. No historical acts, no mythology, nothing like that? Then me. 26. I'm going to examine the skull. I'm taking a look at it, I'm checking to see if it's attached to the-- it's sitting on a column at the moment? I'm seeing if it's attached at all and very gently turning it if I don't see any-- I was just going to turn it. I wasn't quite going to lift it yet. All right, I give it a little lift. Oh god, it's going to talk to me, isn't it? A recognizable cold chill, or a brand-new cold chill? I hate you so much! I'm a little evil magnet, I know. I'm checking, is the emerald set into the socket or is it removable? All right. Natural 20. I think I've found something evil. It's like a ripple, almost like a pond that's just gently disturbed. Oh. I have a thought. This is precisely the sort of awful thing that I would design if I wanted a way to look into a hallway. I'm going to place it back on the column, facing the wall. I would recommend that if we are going to... purloin things, we should do it on the way out rather than the way in. Let's go down. It was just like this last time, except there was brunch. That's all I remember. In her defense, the last time she tried this, it did fly away. It's not a flying tapestry. Such an asshole! Are we going onto the teleportation pad then? Nine. I'll assist in that perception check. All right, taking a look. That's-- Because it's the flat. 13. Yeah. Yeah. Whoa! And I back up and draw. I found something! I'm inspecting him as best I can, frozen solid. No! No, I found this. 14. That's a terrible pun. What is he wearing? No. There's a frozen man. We actually have a mystery. We have to deal with this. He's dead dead. He might be the owner of the house. Torch-heating the face. I'm keeping an eye on the south. That's a big bag you've got there. (groaning) We'll finish looting that once we've cut this thing up into little pieces of sushi. We don't walk away. It's a series of bad decisions.
