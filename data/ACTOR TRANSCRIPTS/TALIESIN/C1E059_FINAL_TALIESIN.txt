Boy and little Chiko! I'm going to put it on my head. Most useful alchemist ever. We may be miming something while the picture's up, and that'll be exclusive content. Trust Scanlan. It's that extra inch that makes all the difference. Oh, cool. Opening credits! [dramatic music] This is fantastic. Oh, it's everything I could have hoped for. Well. Is there any sign of any bit of civilization or construction? Oh lord. Ah! Yay. 26. I think I see a thing. I'm heading in that direction. We are already going. Wait, don't touch. Don't touch. We're going to head towards the stone. Can I add into that, too? I learned Elven. I was a bit of a nerd. Oh yeah, I'm aware my head's full of bullshit, too. Now, don't touch. We'll stay 11 paces away. And a 12. And we're keeping about 11 feet, so. At least. Inner corner or outer corner? Go ahead. I'm going to sit and quietly sketch for a moment. I'm taking everything down. It may or may not be. So there's no carvings that I can see on this outer wall, nothing? And the vines that are climbing on it, are they flowering anything at all? Be very careful. Nothing here is exactly what it appears to be. Oh, I wouldn't do that! I'm trying to very gently back her up. I bow. And I push her down. Natural one. Hello? Oh dear. We're going to have to find her. No. I think she blinded me. No, she blinded me. Yes, I'm blinded. I'm blind. One. (laughter) I'm going to curl up in a little ball for a minute and rock. I'm going to take out my Dragonslayer Longsword and stand up and start using it as a cane. Find my way to Grog and poke him with it. Better. That's 18. Just a tap. Going to give it a good little whack. Oh, I'm sorry! It's so hard to see. I'll take them off and put them in my pocket. No. I've got a thing. It'll be all right. Actually, if you don't mind, can I borrow a bear? Yes. I'm willing to try and make this work for a moment. Do you mind? I'm going to try and hop on top. I'm going to make a leap to get on top of the bear. Which direction was this pool? I'll go with you. Trinket! I think it's probably mystical. Or what passes for west. Like don't pick the flowers. I'm sorry, were you talking to me? I'm a bit useless at the moment. You know I know what you're doing right now? Thank you. I'm still angry with you, but thank you. I put the pistol slowly in the direction of his voice. My lady, I do appreciate your gift, and I do apologize for my friend and for startling you earlier. It is my deepest regret that I cannot take in the majesty of your realm for the moment. Does she go for the wet willie? Are you trying to give me a wet willie? I use missile snare. Still angry at you. Missile snare? With disadvantage? Okay. 26. My kung-fu is far stronger than yours. I have dreamed about coming here since I was a little child. I'm going to see this! I'm on a bear. You're all wearing your earrings. It's dangerous as it is, but-- Be a shame if your broom breaks. I'm just reminding the dear what side her bread is buttered on. Wow. Okay. What? Am I a reckless human? So when I say you shouldn't probably touch anything, there's probably a really good reason, right? I'll have my revenge, but I love you. Oh! Yes, much better. Hi! It's so good to see you. (yelps) I'll make you a deal. Come here. 11. Now we're even. Good. Maybe we're in the dusklands. Well, not necessarily. It could be that we are either stuck in a loop or that we simply in an area of the Feywild that is eternal dusk. So we have to pass a dusk, at least. It could. No, but you might as well. Nothing's safe. Critters everywhere. And if we don't, then we know that there's a problem. And remember in theory, from what little I know, the prettier it is, the more dangerous it probably is, and the older it is, the more dangerous it probably is. I'm going to sit backwards on the bear while we move forward. It occurs to me, I don't actually have to ride the bear anymore. She's done me up. I'm imagining the genie bottle. That you saw? Vex, do you feel like getting a little bit of a bird's-eye view really quickly, perhaps? We can't. There's no trees. I'm feeling pretty confident about this. I'm not having a lot of stress about this. Until it's time that we all think it's time to take a rest, and we'll take a nap. It's a party. We press on until it's time to rest. I say we camp here. I think it's a lovely idea. It suits you. It's lovely. I'm going to use my optics to try and sketch what I can of the city for the moment and get a general idea of it, sitting down and starting to get an idea of it. Don't try and Super Saiyan me. Oh, not quite. I love this place. I do, quite a bit. Let's see your work. I'm going to very gently put my hand on the book and take it. May I? I've been taking notes myself. Do we have that Hunk of-- not that that's going to help here. Is the book safe to open? I'm asking, is it safe to open? For me? What's at the bookmark, may I ask? And I slowly start to open it at the bookmark. I'm gently opening it. He's brilliant. He captured everything. I turn it. I'm going to start gently flipping through some of the pages. Like Six Flags Magic Mountain caricature vibe? This is an awfully expensive book to be this shitty in. I'm going much earlier in the book to see what's there. Dinner! And to sweeten the offer, after you've had dinner with us and we send you on your way, perhaps we will consider giving you your book back. Perhaps. Give me the bits. Shocking otters. Let's have some food. Let's put two guards on him. 20 guards? That's a lot of guards. There's tables. I understand. Honest opinion, what is the disposition of the people in that city over on the hill? You can be frank. We're not from around here. You can't offend us with your opinion of them. They have an army building up? Why is that? You just pinch small things, though, like little gold trinkets. This is not really a talent of yours, is it? Flip, flip, flip. Let us add an addendum, then. If we are going to steal things from you, you will not only take us to the bog-- Are we killing people? No. This is interesting. 17. Interesting. I've got an idea. We broke your ocarina, correct? Why don't I try and fix the ocarina? We give him his book back, we take a couple things from those people and get on our way? We could just get on our way. No, let's make the deal and get this moving. This is a place where deals happen. Let's do it. We agree to the deal, we present it, and then we're there. It's kismet, in my opinion. We're in the Feywild. We're going to make a deal with something. This is what the Feywild is. I want to go there, too. I can't wait. Give me your ocarina. Let me see if I can get to work on it. You can help with a Mending spell. So I'm going to attempt to glue it together, and then I'm going to need something to hold the whole thing together while the glue sets. That was a natural 20. Your instrument, sir. It's quite nice. No, he hasn't. Every time I've seen anything attractive and naked, it's gone very poorly today. I'm walking away. I'm going to start gathering the servants to pick the boy up and put him in his room. Everything would disappear, anyway. I make sure everything's fine. I will leave him his book, lock the door, and head up to my room and lock the door behind me, as well. A week. Is it what I think it is? Okay. Goddamn it. And as I'm going to bed? Or as I wake up? Okay. Fuck. No, you don't know anything yet. I'm not quite going to go to sleep yet. I'm going to go see who else is still awake. The little fucker charmed me. I don't know what we can do. We made a bloody deal with him. Well, no, we can't, really. (sputtering) I don't know exactly how it works. It's just in any book you read about the Feywild, you make a deal and it's a deal and you have to deal with it. I don't think that would work. Maybe? Probably. You would look lovely in eyeliner. It was inevitable. Could be. Right now. I'm going to have to tell the others in the morning. I'm going to go see if anybody else is awake. Oh god. Sleep well. Oh, you're reading. Never mind. Don't sleep. No. Finish your bloody book. Vex. Little shit put a charm on me. I felt it wear off about 45 minutes ago. Yes. Well, I-- Well, at least we know that he definitely can't be trusted. I know. We've got to make sure that Pike doesn't give him back his whistle, just yet. He was so nice! He was just so nice. I did. It's sadly what I knew was he's a little shit. I just didn't know until about half an hour ago. I hate magic! In what sense? Yes. Does she look like she comes from money? (laughs) Honestly, dear, you're too happy to look like you come from money. No, it's a sure sign of it, is an abject misery, believe me. I can speak to it. You look too much like you, and you don't look enough like something you're supposed to be. If you feel the urge to deeply bullshit, I'd be happy to help you. It's not hard. No. It is easy to pretend you come from money. You just have to be a bit of a shit and wear what everybody else is wearing. Does this have something to do with that city? It does, doesn't it. Who's there? (sighs) Well. Oh, I disagree. Dear, I think that if you're worried about them knowing whether or not you've made your money and made your fortune-- I don't think that's going to be the thing to earn their respect. I think you're better off, A, with the company that you keep, and B, with the fact that you're probably just better than most of them. I've known a lot of people with money, and they are definitely not worth you. And besides, if they have something nice that makes you feel inferior, we can just take it. Well, and then they're just shit without anything, and then you're you with their stuff. You're welcome. I know it doesn't really help. Yes. And the outfit works. Don't change it. Keep the hat. Good night. Sleep well. I'm sorry for my part in it. Charming. No, that is awful. I sit down, right in front and across the table. I like it. No, not yet. Not yet. Just so all cards are on the table, we know that we agreed to a deal last night, despite your charm spell on me, which was-- Fair play. Well, the deal stands as it is at the moment, I suppose. Yeah, no, he charmed me. He put a charm on me last night. Well, a little late. Friend, I applaud your cleverness. I am excited by this deal, and I want to let you know that, god forbid something comes up, where I come from, the world I come from, I am possibly the worst person you have ever met. And I think, I hope, not necessarily to hurt you or harm you, but I hope that one day you can know just how awful I can be. 17. Let's hope. I love the art piece. Actually, since we're on the subject, have you ever drawn yourself before? I'd be curious to see one of your self portraits. Are they in the book? I didn't think so. Self-reflection is not one of my favorite pastimes, either. Anyway, what are you looking for in the city? Where did what? Bless the small print. I think it's just a deal. I think deals may be a big deal here. I don't know. I think if it comes to it, it's a possibility. That's a thing. You're clever. I'm sure you'll be fine. I think it's time to make our way in. Can't believe I wasted a natural 20 on his-- Sorry. I'm good. It's from the mansion, so it'll stay in the mansion. We do have nice cloaks we could wear. Am I still made of wood, by the way? It's raining. It's not like Hawaii rain. It's rain, I would assume? It's not chilly, but cold. Oh, yes. I've read things about those. That's just a thing. Just read it. Interesting. I wouldn't expect one. I am so excited.
