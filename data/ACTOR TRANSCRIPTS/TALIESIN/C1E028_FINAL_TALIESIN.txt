Hashtag D&Diesel. So many of them in New York and in San Francisco this week, where we've been all over the place. That were neither critical nor rolls, really to be fair. But they were good. Yeah. MATT and I may have hit a couple people in the face, for which I greatly apologize. Yeah, I like split someone's lip. And we played golf. It was quite nice. Yeah. I think his exact words is, "Is this for us?" (all laugh) The internet went, nope. Yeah! Also in that role, if any Critters are in the Galveston area for Halloween, I will be at OniCon over Halloween weekend. So, you can come say hi in beautiful Galveston by the sea. Galveston, Texas. I'll be wearing a costume. It'll be great. We have gnome? Oh god! I blank out in the booth any time they mention his name. Wait, wait, wait. Dun dun dun dun. [opening credits] Did the creature look like that? Okay, just checking. Oh, that's right. 21. It's bigger than sin, isn't it? Okay, so, I'm going to alert everybody, get down! And I'm going to take three shots-- Hmm? I'm just going to-- look at that thing!! Why doesn't it reason with me, is what I'm asking! It could reason with me! I'm aiming, I'm going to use the Sharpshooter for extra damage. Three pepperbox shots. Yeah, so that's 17. Hmm? Okay. Second one, it hits, 18 plus seven. For the third one, I'm going to go for a head shot instead of a Sharpshooter. And that's 21. 17. Better! 25. That went really well. The last one-- do I do any damage when I hit the head? Normal damage. So, last one is seven points of damage plus he's got-- Yeah, disadvantage on attacks. Am I touching a wall? All right, I'm going to brace against a wall. And I'm going to mark all this off. We're outdoors. Taco. With advantage? Oh, that's right. This is a magic save. I probably should spend Grit. Unconscious. Say your soul is forfeit. For once, you're not the one doing damage to the bear. Brought another sign. Roll like your bear depends on it. You guilted her up to another level. That's not bad. Ack. Oh, wow! We're going there. (sing) Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control. I love that die. You hurt feelings. I'm going to scoot a little bit forward, just into that little crevice. I'm going to take three more shots, just to see what I can do. With the Sharpshooter feat. I have Sharpshooter, so I can ignore cover. Yeah, so. But I'm going to be taking a negative for these hits. Still three attacks per-- Okay. Just making sure I'm doing this right. Yeah. Misfire. (all groan) This normally doesn't happen to me. I don't quite know what-- (all laugh) So can I, at least, use my bonus to pick up the pieces and-- Okay. I'm going to pick up the pieces and-- I'm just going to leave that as an open target for a little while. Ain't nothing. Yeah. But you are behind me. It totally works. Putting glass for the dog-- Kicking myself. This is a repair die. I'm up next. Ugh! All right. I'm going to try and fix this broken piece of gosa. I hit a 12, which is just barely enough to fix it. And I'm going to burn an Action Surge, so I'm just-- I finally get it, and it just starts going. And I'm just going to empty out the chamber. Ho, nelly. I don't have to reload, yet, I've got six shots, so we're still three in the chamber. Unless you, actually-- I have two in the chamber? Okay, so I'll do two, and then use the third one to reload. All right, so-- Ooh, this'll be fun. Sharpshooter shot. That's 22. I'll just take the second shot right now. That's-- really? Really? Really, are we going there? Misfired again. I rolled a two. I got one shot off. Yeah. To a misfire? No. So that's, okay, at least this is a badass, as I at least did some damage. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24 damage, plus four points of fire damage. Oh, I was about to say, and-- Yeah, I wanna get a little further back. I wanna roll to the other side of the cave again, if possible. Yeah. Like, see that little outcropping of rock? Further back. Like that over there. That thing scares me. The beast. That's not good. What?! I'll take that. I'll take that. (all laugh) But you never said he looked a little rough! I kept waiting for you to say it's looking a little rough. Damn it! Well. Yes! I would like to fix my gun. Just a giant pile of tools. Behir. I'd like that. Lick it. Parkour! Parkour! We have jars. I'm going to put that into the jar and put it away. I may have something I can do with this actually. Yes. You're very clever, yes. We'll work on that. Yes. Back in the bag of holding. I'm going to try and fix this mess, for a minute. 18. It wasn't a dual fail. Yes. We should still get out of the taco. Yes? Honestly, I've never taken this road before. This is further east than I've ever come. The geology starting to look familiar? It's starting to look like home, though? I grab Lockheed and we hold him hostage. (all laugh) Or more mirrors. Or an army with mirrors. Yeah, no, I'm walking. I'm keeping an eye open for anything familiar. Do you have to do the hands? That's the most complicated sentence I think I've ever heard you speak. Nothing. Buying it dinner. Wow. Well, we're not heading north. Westish. We're heading westish. Oh, we came up on the western side of the mountains? Western side of the mountains? So Whitestone's to the east? Oh, okay. I thought we went up the eastern side of the mountains. I'm so confused. You wouldn't think I'd lived here before. No, that's very true. Oh, god. In two or three miles, we'll take another check. Do I know what this is? History check? I kind of want Grog to speak truth right here. No, we don't, no. Wow. Holy cow. Should we observe this encampment for a bit, just to see what's happening as we slowly make our way around it? That would also allow us a good view of it as well. Or very cold if they came out. Oh, yes. That's true. I like the plan of going up the other side of the chasm. I don't know if I have climbing gear. 19. That's an intimidation check. Bears climb! They can get up a tree. You could've, it just would've been adorable. 20. It could've been the Briarwoods. We should see everything that's up here. I can't believe I'm about to say this. Now you're not going to be able to see anything because they have terrible eyesight. I'm kidding, they really don't. That's a myth! That's actually a myth! They have actually very reasonable eyesight. That's a myth. You can look it up on Wikipedia, it's true. Oh yeah! Like a ramp. We turn on him. You are the night. What is the sound of a bat coughing? Thank you. It's the simple things. Let's check it out. I'm going to look around a bit more, anyway. I'm looking around, I'm trying to find out what happened to the bodies. I know, apparently, from this roll that I'm in the mountains. I got a six. Vex is making happy noises. It's been so long since you've killed something innocent! Let's bring it! We should probably leave. I think they might. It's a chalkboard. Well yes, so I can now recognize where we are. This is the most exciting map I've ever been handed. Whoa! It won't fit in my folder. What's this little outcropping? Does it? That graveyard does not-- -- it is a surface graveyard. There is a mausoleum-- -- but that-- -- is actually contained beneath the castle. (all laugh) I was wondering that myself. Yes, there is one! I say we scope out the hidden entrance, see if it's guarded, see if they've discovered it. The hidden entrance to the castle. Instead of using it, I think we should possibly spend the night and get a view of the town, see if there's anything unusual. We could send a bird in. Or an invisible gnome. Or both. An invisible bird-gnome. If it's all vampires, it'll be empty right now. SAM and Yes. I say we hide in the trees. Well, it's about to be nighttime, so we'll send a scout. Now that just got weird. Make sure you bring an earpiece. Let's roll again. There was no way to get a good look at who it was. Actually, I would love to. Natural 20. This is an 'I love you' for those awful rolls earlier. That may be its name now. I don't recognize her, though? She'll take that 14. Leave the mug. You say that out loud? You'll hear a thump. We have to wait. It's basically a taser. Good, good. Sticky. Thank you. Can I go with this? Unless you have a particular reason to-- Legends say that before the castle was built, that the journey into the valley was treacherous and stormy, and the original builders of Whitecastle feared they would die. And this one, great tree stood in the valley, and it was underneath it that they took shelter. And as they began to take shelter, the storm broke. And the storm did not return until the castle was completed. We hold our festivals there every year. As a gallow, yes. A very serious god. Tablet of Apple? I say, in the morning we take a look at the passage, see how well-guarded it is. And if it looks dangerous, sneak our way into the town. If people are not enthralled, if they are being forced to work, then maybe we can find some allies. I don't think they're happy. I really wanted to ask. What does peeing on a lemon tree have to do with anything? Thank you for bringing the text chat all the way back around. I do, in theory, if I'm from-- A which? 16. What? Rally the townsfolk. This is something I think-- I don't think that sneaking in is necessarily the answer. I'm not saying go in, guns blazing, but I say we let them know-- I want to build a rebellion. I have a plan. It does. My plan is, we do our best to sneak in, we find cover. Obviously, you said there's abandoned buildings. We find cover. We heal the tree. I have some other ideas. We take those zombie giants out one by one, quietly. Okay. Let's start finding our friends, and we start making friends. We let them know we're back. I have some parchment. I have the thing I want to build, while I'm in the tree. It's very simple, and I want to show you what it is. I want to take some gunpowder and basically-- Basically attach it to a piece of parchment. I want to wet it into a piece of parchment and let it dry so that when I set fire to that piece of parchment, I get a burn scar. I'd like to create a burn scar. Thank you. No, it'll scar anything. It just creates a very high heat. Like a mark. Not our mark. The resistance. I rolled a 23. Does it change color when it loses its power? Damn it! I want to know. God damn it. Your poo power may come in very handy. This is good to know. A scat grenade. Scatlan! So you can get a beret. Which is why I'm going to be wearing-- I haven't been seen in years, and when I was seen, I was much younger, and honestly-- I had different hair. Yes, they do. They did, which was disorienting. I already have the hat. I've been trying to think of what sorts of buildings would be the most defensible and the least likely to arouse suspicion. Things with basements? That's too obvious. I would almost say a shopping district. If there's an abandoned storefront. Might be too close. We're not going to be there for long. We have food rations. We have options. I have a plan. Let's make our way in. We find a place to at least set up our operation. We don't. Let's get in and set up. No, we're going to stealth into the city. Isn't that dope? Do we have Pass Without a Trace? I'm wearing my hat, too. That's really good, because I rolled a one. 11. Trinket looks like a donkey. A milk cow! Donkeys can move more quickly. This is true. (goat bleat) Thank you for the double 20. Coming in from the west. I wanna head through the city, possibly in the direction of the cemetery. Yeah, I wanna head in that direction. What's changed? They want it to be really dark. I'm also thinking about that cemetery. Everything here is super creepy. Let's get east of the center square and set up camp. Actually, I would say let's get a good look at the tree, let's walk by it. 23. I am walking the fuck away. I'm a little curious-- Is there anything around the tree other than us? Is there something at the base of the tree, is there anything? I should know what it is, anyway. We can't go anywhere near those buildings. We have to stay as far away as humanly possible. Can I help? Oh! Never mind. They invited us. Sticking with the plan. Going to go find something that's a decent distance away from the three noble households, that has a reasonable view of the tree. Something with a second-floor view, but with some distance. Meh. Six. Dust of tracelessness. Yeah. This is where we're going to hole up. Yeah, we're all going in. Not yet. That's going to be the saddest brothel. Muscle relaxers. Is there a view of the tree? It's a bit of a ways. Just so light doesn't leak out. I'm going to tinker a little thing. Can I borrow an arrow? Thank you. I'm going to tinker a very little, easy thing. I want to be able to fire and ignite one of the parchments on an arrow. So that I can-- -- set a burn mark at a distance. It would be a spark, as opposed to actual flame. It would just be concussive force. It would be coiled. Hit, release. 16. There might be, but just in case there's not, I want to make sure this works. I've got three of them, so I've got options. But I just want to make sure-- The only superpower more pathetic than Aquaman's. Sorry, had to. Hi, Aquaman. Hi, Aquaman. Hi, Aquaman. Hi, Aquaman. It's what fish say. Hi, Aquaman. Hi, Aquaman. Put your hand in it. Yes. Let's eat. You have at least one. Damn it. You also get other bonuses. Or any of the other terrible people who live in this town because there are terrible people in this town. I love you all so much. I love you so much. I have stuff to give you, too, 'cause, yeah. Thank you for letting me roll with that, by the way. I had a funny feeling it would. That was some mean shit, man. Yeah, no, so that was it. There was no banhammer? Guys, thank you, oh my god, I'm so happy to be sharing this. Yeah we do. Thank you, we're very sorry! You dropped Whitestone. I wanna say, we had a studio audience for this show as well, which we're very thankful for. Thanks for just stopping by. That was cool.
