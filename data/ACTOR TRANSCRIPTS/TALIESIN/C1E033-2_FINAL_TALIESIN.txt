Just hit him with your stick. No! Wow! Yay, you hurt it. I'm going to collapse in a corner for a minute and start using my ascot to clean some of the gore off my weapon and my clothing and my mask. (coughs heavily) I want to see what color you turned. Oh my god, yeah! (laughter) Snakes on a Plane 2 More Snakes, More Plane. I'm going to collect some of Vex's arrows. You can't have my d8s. Okay, fine, have my d8s. I'm collecting three or four of Vex's arrows from the ground and getting them in my hand, and I'm staying back from all of this and letting it happen. Vax, are you all right? That's good. I'm going to now take my handful of what is now basically a switch, and I'm going to start whacking him with it really hard on the chest. You! Don't go into rooms by yourself, god damn it! Thank you, but count to ten. And now I drop them and go over to my sister. Hi. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for leaving you. I wouldn't trade. Are you all right? Did they do anything? Are you yourself? Perception check? Insight. I want to make sure she's not holding anything really important back. Insight? Do I get a bonus for that right now? It's a wisdom-- yeah! This is not a saving throw, though. 11. We're putting an end to the Briarwoods tonight. Before the sun sets. This is the end of them. It's all going to be over, and we're going to stop whatever it is they're doing under the city. I know. This is it. I know, and I'm so sorry. You're going to your room. To wait until this is over. (sputters) You're-- I don't think that's a very good idea. God, you're irritating. Fine. Ugh! She's so obnoxious. What? Oh god, I do. Yay! I'm still upstairs. Are you going to come meet us again upstairs? Taking a short rest. We're waiting there. They followed her down; I'm waiting on Cassandra. Come up. Yeah, waiting in the study. Does Grog show up? We have bigger issues than Anna at this point. Grog, do you have the Bag of Holding? Can you scoop up what's left of Professor Anders? I don't want any of him sticking around. Fire will do. There is. Throw him in. Fine, we'll throw him in the fire. We don't want him coming back. Take his shoes. Like Willy Wonka. Shall return. TALIESIN and Jarl. Maybe he was dictating. He could have a secret entrance to our Keep that he built and didn't tell us. You shat in the kitchen? You've squeezed all you're going to be able to get out of that. Can I think of a way? I'm assuming I know a way to where this might be. She's going to take us. Apparently. These are my friends, by the way. Lead the way, sister. I don't know if it will actually-- I would have to probably train you in how to use it. It's a little more complicated than that, actually. I'll load one for you. I'll give him her boomstick. Just making sure it functions, too. Doing okay. Not doing great, but I'm doing okay. I'll steal it back from him if I need, but it should be fine. No, if you have it. Give it to him. This is literally how she lost her hand. I hand him the ammunition. I load four of them. (sighs) Can we do one thing before we go down into the cellar? This is the best day of my life, and I can't help but be suspicious. Is there any way to check if she's being controlled? Can we put your helmet on her? I do trust you. That's the problem. I've got nothing. (sighs) What would happen if we put your helmet on her? This would disrupt it, maybe. Does the hat need to be attuned over a short rest? Wait, it was Greater Restoration? MARISHA and Ah! I have a potion. This should solve all of our problems. No, it will be-- And I'm pulling out a potion bottle. This is if you are controlled. This could fix it. I look at her. That was actually a minor healing potion. I was just seeing if you did it intentionally. (laughter) I figured it was worth a shot. Best we're going to do. All right. It's been a long time. (sighs) Let's go down and take care of this. Cass? Yeah. There's a first time for everything, I suppose. I'm having that thought, as well. That's a series of words that I know individually, but he strings them together in ways that don't make any sense. No! You crazy motherfucker! Hello Trinket? Abrasiveness is his most powerful weapon. Oh yeah. Please. Thank god. Yeah. 21. Yes, Keyleth? Is there anybody who is not made uncomfortable by this? Of course, Keyleth. Carry on. It will be no problem at all. Right. Let's go. I think I still have a torch, actually. Yeah. So I'll be in the back with my sister. Go home, de Rolo, you're drunk. Yeah. Not fun. Oh! Natural 20. I had a one today. I had a one. That's shapeways.com. There was that sea of glass. The dot. I wonder if something very, very hot... 25. Damn it! I feel like an asshole. I feel like an asshole. I'm changing dice. This is bullshit. I'm changing dice. It's a hollow die. There's nothing to be weighted on it. It's a wiffle die. 28. Thank you for that. I yell, "Look out!" And I take several steps toward Vax. Actually, on the other side of the pillar so I can actually see the one that's getting towards him. Yeah. I know. I want to back up into that corner, though, just to get away from them. Yeah. I'll take-- fuck. Yep, screw it. I'll take shots with the Pepperbox. I'll take my first shot. That can't be right. Just checking. 20. Natural 20. With a different die. Of course, with a different die. I'm the devil. I am the devil, and I have come to do the devil's work. I will lick your die, because that is how I bless them. First attack. Yeah, all against the same guy. First attack is 22 points of damage. No, no element. I spin. Shoot with fire. What the fuck?! Taking a picture. I don't know! I'll put it on Instagram later. I go to Vegas. I don't gamble! All right. This is fire elemental. That's 14 points of damage, plus three damage of fire. Including the crit damage. I rolled really poorly on my damage. We need magic! I'm taking my last shot. Okay, see? That's better. 15. All right. They're easy to hit, at least. That's such a shitty roll. 12 points of ice damage. Yeah, I'm out. What for? God damn it. Oh god. This is going to go so poorly. Roll your initiative. I don't know what to do. Okay! What are we going to do? (sighs) All right, who's the most dangerous? That's my first action. I'm going to use my bonus action to turn to my sister and go, what the hell do we do? All right. I'm-- I'm backing up. I'm going to do my best to back up into the tomb right here. Keep going to my right until the drop-off behind me, and I'm going to back up into the tomb. No, up. Towards you; the other side. There we go. I'm putting my back against the wall. I mean that column. Yeah, there. Yeah! I'm unloading two shots. I'm reloading and unloading two magical shots at Vax. I'm going to burn some fucking points. What am I going to do? First shot-- fuck it, I'm using the old die. I've already rolled two 20s on that one. First shot, I'm shooting to get Vax to drop his knives. Burning a grit point to drop his knife. One of them out of his hand. The one that doesn't auto-return. They all do? Shooting him in the face. Fuck it. And my gun jams. You did that! (frustrated noise) Yep. 22 hits. Oh yeah! Magic fingers. Yeah! Treguna mekoides-- Trecorum satis dee. Yay, radiant damage. That's awesome. You made a good call. (squeaking noise) Maybe. You don't know. Shut up! It's "ow." Oh, that's my mausoleum. (gasps, sighs) "Hi!" I saw what just happened, right? I'm going to try to fix my gun. That fixes. (sighs) Are you better? Good, then let's deal with this. I'm going to start diving around the columns to get away from the wraith. Yeah, because I don't have a shot this round. Yeah, cool. That ends my turn. I have advantage on charisma saving throws right now, do I not? Oh, then never mind. What's my charisma saving-- oh boy. Nope. I rolled a natural one. You did this! This is the third natural one. You touched it. I'll come back to you after Thanksgiving, baby. I'm not reading too much into this. This is not a metaphor! 18. I'm imagining a bear doing mild calisthenics. Poor Cass. Yeah. (laughter) I'm going to use this die, because it's been-- That's-- I can't talk. 21. 21. 26. All right. 13. Fuck me. 15. And 11. 21. (ghost noises) 16? Cool. 21? I'm still doing fine. Thank you for that. I was almost going there. (creepy voice) I'll swallow your soul! Is no one a Sam Raimi fan? Never mind. 18. It has to be magic damage, though. Okay, so it's taking damage, too. That's good. Maybe. I do. Does he get an attack of opportunity? Yes! 14? I'm already out. Yeah, go ahead, but I'm out. It was just a crit. It wasn't hit twice. Yay! Oh, for the love of-- Whoa! I passed my first one. I have two failures and one success. So guys? Heal me. Heal me now. (sings) It's delightful, it's de-lovely. Thank you! Nine. Nine points! Ah-ah-ah. Your aura thingy with 15 feet should do it. Which one of my ancestors did you just shame to death? Again? Okay, fair. You're going to say it, aren't you? Let's pull ourselves together. I've got three. Probably. That's nice. We'll heal, but I think we need to continue down. Don't loot my family's crypt! Welcome, all! This is Twitch. Holy cow. I'm not at a hundred, but I'm okay. Ashley is getting home right now, in case we need her. Can she come in for 30 seconds and heal us? I know. Holy cow. No. No. Yeah, that will be the Crit-- Move it to the 10th. I'm literally leaving the studio on the 17th for a road trip. Creepiest character in the Marvel universe. He is the creepiest creep. That's Tennant. That's also who I dressed up as at the superhero party. I painted myself purple. There's an amazing photo of a friend of ours dressed as Luke Cage, just beating the shit out of me. It's amazing. "Start Wearing Purple." It was creepy. It's just going to be bad. Happy Thanksgiving!
