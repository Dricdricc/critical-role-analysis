I think everyone's mostly fine. It looks like a river, at the very least. Don't trust anything in the Feywild! How far in does it take to cross all of these little rivers? What's the speed and roughness of the ten-foot? Let's find a nice mix of not-too-wide and not-too-rapidy. Not too fast. And start thinking of a way across it and making sure that it's not magical or strange. And I rolled a nine. I think I'm fine. I'm just wet. Ten. Wow. Perception check with disadvantage? That's not that bad. Where's my perception? There it is 14. We didn't actually even defeat it. That was very clever with the pot, by the way. That was less clever, but still very impressive. What if we were to throw your chain, or if we could throw the rope across the river? Yeah, no, that's better. No, Vax has already crossed. We're not going to feel the angst coming off of him. Here's a thought. We take the rope, we tie ourselves to it, we toss it over to the two of you, we start using it to wade, you help pull us over. Everybody would have to be terrible for everything to go. Everybody will be fighting together to get across. As long as we're tied together, we can only go so far. It'll be like mountain climbing. I think they're across two. That's good. 20 feet across. Yes. I'm sure. That was a little harsh. See? Better. We can do that in five minutes. Easy plan. Easy peasy. Teleport with the Immovable Rod. You shoot one end of the rope to him. Everything's easy peasy. I grab it, too. What are you doing? Oh, that's good. I rolled a ten. I'm not that strong! So I tie the rope to myself. We're going to tie a rope to you. You should be in front, and then the rest of us. Vax, Vex. 13. Only for Aquaman is this favored terrain. You're great! Run! I believe in you. That's my jam. 27. To the future! Me. It was Vax, Garmelie, Vex, Keyleth. Don't say that. That's not cool. I haven't seen that river in two years. It's so nice. That was terrible initiative. I am embarrassed by my initiative. 13. He's thinking an alligator voice is going to hurt a lot. That's what he's thinking. (laughs) Yeah, you haven't raged yet. Uh. I feel like we're learning a lot. We'll see. We're all still tied to him! Can he roll for gag reflex? There's a rope coming out of his throat. Oh boy. A lot of my plans got swallowed. Okay. I'm going to pull out the Retort pistol, because Bad News will not be happy at this range. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take a head shot. I'm going to try and blind him for the round. This is going to go great! See, I'm too nervous to even take Sharpshooter, so we're just going to do this clean. And I roll a natural 20. Fuck it. The trick is not to care. It's good enough. 26. Fuck, I forgot to cast Hex. Goddamn it. Can I throw my bonus in there really quick? They watch the show; they've heard me say worse. Can I sneak Hex in there? I can get it in between attacks. Technically not. It's a bonus action. I'll do whatever you say. I'm not going to fight you. I'm trying to find my d10s. Okay, here we are. So that's 11 points of piercing damage. The save DC is a 19 on a constitution save. It's not blinded. It has disadvantage on attacks until my next turn. And now I'm Hexing. I'm going to give him a disadvantage on strength checks. Strength or constitution? I'm not asking. Why am I asking people? Asking is for quitters. Still at disadvantage because of the close proximity? Is his mouth open? Am I close enough to start laying in a few shots inside? I'm going to lay in a couple shots inside. Two more shots inside with Hex attack. I'm going to try and go for the sides. If I hit Grog, I don't care. He can take it. With disadvantage, that's a jam on the Retort pistol. Wait! No, that's a save reroll. Fuck my life. Okay, so that's a jam, and one to try and fix it really quickly, just trying to give it a clear, with not disadvantage, because it doesn't matter. One. Yeah. Roll damage, anyway? I hate you. That's ten points of damage. I don't have a jam? Okay, so I'm going to do a clear. Sorry! One more shot. I tried to clear. It clears. I hit 16 plus-- I don't have a third shot, but now I'm at least reloaded. Do I need another round to reload, or does that count as a reload, a clear? I can never remember. Okay, so I'll have to next turn. Okay, I'll just call that clear. The last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to move away from the crocodile with all my strength, and I'm going to say everybody pull! And I'm backing up. This is going to be so sad. It might be fine. Oh god. I have the worst strength. Eight. We technically have our hands free and are tied to the rope, so in theory we could still use our hands and just try and all shift backwards like stupid people. I hope I have its attention. It's really hard to count up here. You're still raging, too, because I hit you. Bring it! That hits. I'm using my new fancy counter. I'm so excited to take damage. I'm not that excited to take damage. 34? Grappled and restrained. You got this. You do. So I'm grappled. There's nothing I can do. And everything I have, at least at the moment, anything with a gun is at disadvantage. Oh, but I've got Hex on him, so even if I hit him with a sword, it's an extra d6. I'm going to try and start hacking him to let me go. Ooh! Weird question. If I use the drop-it effect, the grit drop an item, can I get him to drop me, as an item? Sticking him in the jaw, I can't get him to? I can't make him roll to drop? I was hoping. Okay, in that case, I'm going to grab my sword and start hacking at him. Okay, that's a 15? Did I? No, I don't have advantage for these. That was the first attack since her Guiding Bolt? 15. Okay. The next roll wasn't a 20, so it doesn't matter, anyway. That's 28. MATT Those do have disadvantage. All right, so that hit, and then for my last one... That's not bad. 21. Let me get my new d8. That's super. Oh, I can get all my d8s. And then 3d6 for some necrotic damage. So that's 13 points of necrotic damage and 37 points of slashing damage. Oh, god, that game again. It's a sign he's going to turn on us at any moment. I'm a little iffy, but I'm okay. What is that? How many-- oh, she's rolling dice. 19. That's nice. There's so many rings on it. It's great. Ow! Grog, could you help with this? I really wanted alligator boots, but I suppose that will do. Please help. What? No! Oh, ow! I stand up and kick one of them. All right, there's a river. Actually, there's an empty stomach, isn't there? I'm going to stick my head in and see if there's anything in there. Just for fun, Grog, smash this. Anything exciting come out? I'm going to pick one up and bring it to Keyleth. For you. Well done. (applause) I'll go. Can I acrobatics check this to try and make the landing? That'll be a 21. I was already covered in crocodile bile. This is another layer of sadness. Cast Hunter's Mark really quick. We should move until it's time to camp, and when we camp, we should camp in your palacious... I don't think it works that way. I think you have to tell them, and then they have to say it. 16. Apparently, he's fine. 33. I'm going to mask it. That simple. This is not the woods. This is a bog. So take the broom back and fly 100 feet behind him. It's an idea. Really? They may know where we want to go, though. I'm not saying they're nice. I'm saying that maybe we need some new guidance. We'll shoot you first. You won't feel anything. No, not really. We'll send Trinket, too, so either way, you feel like you've accomplished something. You'll both die, and then you'll know that the bear goes with you. Don't answer that. That's a fair point. We'll keep an eye out, Vex. It'll be fine. You are charming. You're both very charming, so be charming. You're extremely charming. She is charming. I think with this many witnesses, it's not a threat. It's a promise. I want a good vantage. How many windows are there? Just one window? What size person is the chair for? Do you describe this? Her house is going to have chicken feet. (laughter) I am watching that hag through my scope with everything I've got. Run. We should go.
