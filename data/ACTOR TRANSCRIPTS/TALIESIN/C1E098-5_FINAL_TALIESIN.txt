I think we're going to have our Wednesday Club this Wednesday. I think we're going to do Wonder Woman. We were having a straw poll, where I think we're going to be talking about Wonder Woman. Yeah, we don't normally veer relevant, but we figure this is kind of a big deal so, you know, and it's an interesting conversation. No, but I know of Groo. We don't know Groo well enough to really delve in. Not the one you'll be on? You'll watch it, then? Okay. (laughter) You gave me that really good comic book for-- was it Christmas last year? Or the year before, because I read it in Colorado, it was really nice. A Nintendo Switch! I'm with Travis on this one. It's just not the same. No. Is this your first Battle Royale? So, what happens though, is that the people who are obviously the problem often get targeted first. And then it'll be other people who somehow have all their hit points in Round Four. Mr. Loot-Drop may go down early. Four. Three. Yeah. 29. Ain't gonna have a repeat of last time. I was just low enough, if I had been above Liam, that would have been the end of him, but he hid. I'm going to activate the Boots of Spider Climbing. Should knock that out. I'm going to charge Diplomacy. And then I'm going to-- I ain't hiding. That little hut. Actually, how far-- I have a-- (counting) six, one, two, three, four, five-- Yeah, let me get just one step back or so. Still at the edge, on the other side, though. To your right. Yeah, and boots are activated, Diplomacy is activated. I can't. Who can I see? I can barely see Grog with three-quarters cover. That's fine. That's my first shot then. Let's just take a couple shots at Grog. You know, if you hadn't made it all the way up that tower you'd be in intense trouble right now. Okay, just pointing that out. Yeah, I ignore three-quarters-- Let's do first shot with Animus. That's a 29 to hit. That hits? All right. Let's just roll all three first. Oh! No. And then the second one is a misfire. LAURA, Gun-break misfire. It's gun-break misfire. That's okay. Yeah, so I'll just take my third shot with Bad News. Just for fun. 20 to hit. One Animus shot, one Bad News shot. And I also take, really quickly, I take a little damage. 2d6 psychic damage. Five, six, seven. Seven points of psychic damage. Did I-- No. It doesn't matter anyway, because I was going to call Hex, but I'll do it later. Fuck it. All right. Let's roll. I'm also going to run some Cabal's Ruin into this, just for fun. So, let's do the first one, is 1d10. Yeah. So, 1d10 plus 1d6. So, first shot is ten points of piercing damage and four points of psychic damage. Then, the Bad News is-- So, that's cocked. That's seven, eight, nine, ten, 11. 17 points of piercing damage. And let's just-- three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. This is not halved, is it? I'm going to empty Cabal's Ruin into him. 10d6. Six, 15, 20. 33 points of lightning damage. I'm not going to blow my bonus for now, but I am going to run down and across towards that tower towards you. As far that way as I can go. Is there a door, by the way, in that thing? Okay, I'll eventually be heading towards that. I hit you with a ball of lightning, man, like a Tesla coil. Do it. Does the ball count as someone else, or just Doty? You have a beacon. It's a very nice beacon. It's probably going to attack us. Like the worst spin art ever. Doty's not going to win this. I'm going to dive into that room. So I've got two more movement? Two more bits of movement? I'm going to go over to the chest. I'm going to try and fix my gun really quickly. That's fine. Had to roll a nine, I got a 12. And then I can't open the chest as well. All right. I'm just going to hide and wait. Yeah! Yes. I'm so excited that I don't have to be the one to kill you. I don't want to be the one to kill you. I'll never live that down. This is a great map. We can't give suggestions, can we, over the earpiece? Oh, shit. Damn it. Fuck, I had such a good thing to do! This is the Overwatch map I've been waiting for. Whittle him down. You're not having a good day. You're like an Ernest film right now. Ernest goes to war. Your nervous system knows to keep you awake and conscious for that whole event. It's un-bear-able. 35? He's a lootdrop. We just have to-- Like he's like such a lootdrop. Not anymore, it's now eight. It's nine rounds or eight rounds. This is such a Community episode in eight rounds he dies of exposure. I wait nine rounds. (laughs) I'm going to check that chest. Is that a full action? All right. I take the greater healing potion. And then I've got some movement, right, okay. And then I go one, two, three, four-- Can I get to behind that building? Behind the building towards you? No, no like directly-- Yeah, like as far over there as possible. I'll come out the door I came in. Yeah, over there. And if I have anything left I'll start walking up the wall. I know I won't make it. Not quite, next round I'm going to pop up. Knock it prone. Yep. I love it. This is like Battlebots. You could release him into the acid, though. I imagine this as the interior of the genie bottle from I Dream of Jeannie. Pink and plush. Oh my god. They'd have to think of it. I wouldn't think of attacking the room, and he's designed to hurt rooms. The room could collapse and squish him like a bug, for all we know. Oh god, I love watching his brain strain. You punched a hole through time and space. Well done. Pulling around the corner. Yep. Casting Hex on Grog. And now I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot and add a point of grit for an aimed shot to the legs. Actually, does that make that harder for me to shoot him later? No, I mean if you're prone. I can still shoot him just fine. In that case, I'm going to hold on that grit, and I'm instead going to use a piercing shot with sharpshooter. So for shot number one, with Animus, sharpshooter. Oh, for fuck's sake. It's another misfire. No. So that needs to be picked up. That's fine. Irritated, I pull out Bad News and take another shot. This is also piercing. Another grit spent. Oh, thank you. God damn it... That's better. 22? Yes. Thankfully, it can't misfire when I do this. 16. Aw, shit. So that's (counting). That's 33 points of piercing damage. Plus four necrotic damage. And I'm going to take my last shot. Actually, I'm going to take a Retort shot, because this is the fucking day I'm having, and I'm going to burn another grit, and I'm going to try and knock him prone, because you're welcome. That, too. This is another sharpshooter with Retort. Ugh, that's a 16. 16 to hit. Goddamn it. I'm diving back behind the bloody doorway, goddamn it. Yep. That did not go well. Yep. Oh, you have a disadvantage on wisdom saving throws right now. Wisdom checks. I want to make sure you really suck at them right now. Like the Matrix. I take two psychic damage on top of that. I forgot about that. All right. I'm only nine hit points down. No, you went to hammer. 28 hits. 26 points of damage? Okay. Fuck. Fuck, dude. All right. Is that everything so far? Is that rolled into what you just did? 51 points, so I'm at 26. 51. I have a Hail Mary at the end of this. We'll see how it goes. Oh yeah. Okay, I actually have to do the math to see. I don't think I'm unconscious. No, I'm not, but that hurt. I'm going to do the math with a calculator-- 26, 51, and 19. I've taken 105 points of damage. I have 35 points remaining. I'm at 35. I'm at 140 points. I have 140 hit points. I also had nine points of damage from psychic damage from my own fucking gun. Oh, I took how many points of damage? I could roll a natural 20. No. Hex gone. It's kind of brilliant. Oh here's a hail Mary. First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use my bonus action to down a potion of greater healing, which is how many d4? 4d4 plus four. Let's make that happen. That's okay. 15 points of healing. That's one hit from Grog that I can now take. I'm going to try and hit him with Diplomacy. Since I'm technically in grappling distance, I can't shoot, and if I try to move, he's going to hit me, so I'm going to attempt to hit him with Diplomacy and see what happens. What is that, since I haven't used it... Where is the card? I have a lot of them out. It's a dex-based unarmed melee attack. Just dex modifier? Add the proficiency bonus? Okay, thank you. That's less of a hail Mary. Slightly. Oh my god. 14. I've rolled three ones and a two this game. Another round with it? 17? Okay! That's 2d12 electrical damage. That's 24 points of lightning damage. Guess what. Make a constitution saving throw. No. You actually no longer have disadvantage. You have a 27? Oh, I'm so fucked. Nope. It doesn't do what I was hoping it was going to do. That would've saved my goddamned life. Yeah, if he had rolled low. He takes 12 points of lightning damage. What the fuck else am I going to do? I can run like a motherfucker. Let's see. But I can't use my gun, can I? Oh wait, I would've had advantage, but I didn't get advantage on the-- I can't hit him with my gun, but I can still hit him with my sword. Okay. So I have two more sword attacks, and then I've got to figure out some shit. Let's take two-- I have three attacks. But I had advantage, so technically that was one attack. So I'm going to take two sword attacks. No, I don't. That's a 27 piercing. No, I'm sorry. That's to hit. I'm sorry, my brain is-- you're scaring me. 25 to hit and 21 to hit, so both hit? (counting) 22 points of piercing damage. And I'm going to burn an action surge. You can't use an action to disengage unless you have it. I'm just fucked, aren't I? I'm going to take my heal with that action surge. I'm going to heal up. Yeah, I know. That's awful. 14 points of healing, but it'll get me away. 26 to hit? Hits. 24. Okay. That's his reaction, so I can run now. Oh. Well, that's fine. Yeah, you'll be laughing when I'm far away from you. I've got to get some distance. I'm going to start running straight up the tower. That'll do. I don't need a ladder, though. I don't want to go around that wall. I want to go up that wall. Yeah. That's the end of my fucking turn. All right. I have to roll a strength check against bramble? Shit. Yeah, no. I'm fucked, anyway. Oh, I have another action surge that I didn't-- I was hoping. 38 plus six lightning damage? And then I'm going to take... ugh, this is the worst I've ever rolled in my life. 38 plus six lightning. I'm going to bring that down to 25 points of damage. From the Gloves of Missile Snaring. So 38 down to 25. Plus six lightning damage? Still alive. 16? Actually, this is better. I'm so sorry. Strength saving throw, 22. That hits. No, it's smart. I'm bleeding out. I'm just blood. Once per turn. It's a reaction. I'm out. Are we doing death saves? He burns an action doing this, I assume. (laughter) Yeah, in my bag. Is Vex on fire again? This board was designed to actually fuck with the two of us, because we don't have any good long-distance shots but they have nothing but cover. He is being so smart. I know. It's a horrifying piece of paper. Do something crazy. Start texting. You have that thing you can do. It's time. Yeah! I've been waiting for it. (cackles) A two and a one, even better. He rolled a two. He rolled again and rolled a one. But it does mean that you have disadvantage on the attack. It could be anything. It could be something you're downright immune to. Here's 10d6. One, two, three... Here's ten. Here's ten right here. All the ones that are not yours. Oh man. Oh, that's bad. Points of damage. On fire. And ones you reroll, right? (cackles) 70. Is that getting closer to the dragon? That's a d6. No. Two, four, six, eight, nine, and you have one. There you go. 35 points of poison. I'm enjoying being the rules Nazi here. Just hide and be extremely inconvenient to Matt. I'm so sad I'm dead right now. This would've been worth everything. Good god. I'm so proud of you. This is the end of Cabin in the Woods. I'm so impressed. Lighting a cigarette at the end of the world. He literally has no idea. We should totally do that. We should plan something. Yeah! Do it, I'm so proud of you! No good, really bad day. Oh my god. Choose the form of your destroyer. I'm so excited! Oh, I know how Ruin works. Oh shit. This is amazing. That's the highest number you really know. Everything is just more fives. Here's another question, when was the last time you hit something? That's going to be hard to clean up. Fear? You've had a few of those tonight. Don't be greedy. Whoa! This is what's been happening all night. You have your bonus and your movement. You are the luckiest motherfucker. This has all been just-- Oh my god. Ooh. Oh. Yeah. Oh my god. There's six places he should have died. Oh, that's depressing. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Does he stay on the broom? Quite well, I might add. He's right under you. I don't think we ever built a safety net into his broom. Yeah! Oh my god. He had 25. Solid. And there was one trunk left? I kept thinking about telling you. Yeah, bottom left. But it wasn't my turn, so I didn't say anything. (giggles) That was nuts. There's so many ways that you could have died tonight. If that glove had worked, I would have had an action surge and five shots to the head. It's a wicker basket. That plus two to modifier? There's a lot. Came in the mail a little while ago. I went down hard, man. Again, if the glove had worked, it would have been amazing. That would have been an ugly, terrible death for Grog. With good rolls. Not only that, but the gun that does damage when it jams jammed twice. Show us your hands. You're going to be hard to see in the forest. I think 20th episode, really.
