This feels sacrilege. It's even what passes for cold out here in beautiful California. And it's on Twitter. It was your pun! You were the one who demanded Socks Machina. Yes, M & M and L & T. It's in two weeks. The weekend of November 17th. There are a few other-- I don't know if they gave you the full page. (Grog voice) I think so, yeah. There's a few other things that happened, also. The Critical Role podcast got updated today. It now goes to 70, I believe. We're now at episode 70. It goes all the way to 70 now. I know, it's great. We're also, some of us are going to be at BlizzCon tomorrow. You can find us. There's a Geek and Sundry panel at 400 on the Epic stage at BlizzCon. I have this in my head. Now that I don't have a game in my head, all of this new information has flooded through. Also, Phil LaMarr is coming onto the Wednesday Club next week to talk Thor and his hammer. It's going to be fun. I was asked to inform everyone that there's going to be no Gather Your Party, because BlizzCon, so instead it's going to be Tales from the Loop with Amy Dallen, Vorpahl, Sax, Rachel, Gina, and Kelly Del Angelo is going to be GMing, and it's going to be nuts. That'll be Friday while we're partying at BlizzCon. Like cards, then? Too real. Not in the least. None of this makes any sense. These numbers seem completely arbitrary. I think he might have eaten something in the back. This is not normal. Is the baby also covered in vomit? I feel like we have warned you about eating cheese before bed. I grab the spear. Yes. They didn't take it, so I will take it now. It's my spear. I wish to examine the spear. Is it a special spear? Is it an interesting spear? Does it do anything? Does it require batteries? It's a muscle reaction, it's inevitable. Did you not take any drama classes as a child? I'll go talk to the barkeep. Another round for everyone. Your finest. (shouting) Another round for everyone! Your finest! To drink! Another round of drinks! For everyone! Why would I do--? Your finest! What's your name? Why do I care about his name? But his name is Grog! All right, I'll admit, that is quite charming. Bobaline, I feel, really, is quite appropriate. I don't understand how a bar runs out of alcohol after one round for five of us. What's your son's name? Bobaline and Timothy. That's excellent. I should write that down to make sure that you don't forget it or screw it up later. This cellar has better food than your mansion. 23. Dex proficiency, for god's sake. Were you never in school? Have you never done this before? This is everything I did in school. I remember this game. We should try it. Oh shelves! There's a leathery book?! I'm taking the leathery book, my god. I want to read the title. There should be a title on the cover. Books have titles on covers. It says "Ledger." I'm going to open up the book. Vex, why are you making a Keyleth face? Well, I've got to try this really quickly. I take a sip. Sip. Sip. I know, you have to be very careful because there's broken glass. The best kind. No. I rolled a four. Oh my. We speak of this never again. We should open the book, though. Are they in a particular order? Using my deftness of wit, can I start to put together some meaning to the numbers and words within this ledger? Goddamn it! For a while. You're imagining wrong. Can't tell them, you're not there! Don't forget the pig. 300 Xylophone Players. My god, you could retire on that! In fact, you could retire quite well on that. That may have happened. Extremely intelligent. I was assuming it was actually his hand you were manifesting, like he was a large purple-- Was his name Bigby? Oh, so it was an applause hand? Timothy, is that you? What strange intelligence would have gone through this hall and lit torches that were eight to ten feet off the ground? That's very particular. Flagon sense? 19. Why not add ten? Have you been at the arts and crafts? Let's not look. He's setting something up. I'm not going to look. Close your eyes. That looks nothing like me. It's totally off. This is very impressive. 17 for me. Gently, checking for traps. That's not how the game works, no. Oh no. I'm going to carefully examine the floor. Matt's going to get his-- That mat is permanently scarred. 22. Initiative. What we're rolling. Yes. You roll your initiative die. 16. 16. I rolled very poorly. Yes. Well, I'm going to back up and take a shot at this-- No, away from the ghost. Away from the ghost a bit, and I'm going to take a shot. I'll just take one, since it seems we're being sporting about it. So I'm going to use my magical psychic shot. And that's not bad. That's a 24. All right. Well then, I'm going to do that, plus this. And I'm also going to hit him with a bit of electricity, as well. Ooh, that's lovely. That's ten points of damage, plus six points of psychic damage, plus four points of electricity. I'm going to peruse the rest of the-- If I get too close to the tip, I might experience a burning sensation from the torch. 20. Really? All right, I'm pushing on it. Oh, this will go well. Pushing. Push it. Oh no. That would be a-- That is indeed the lowest number you can get. (lisping) I could use some assistance with this. Please. He's going to have to cross the thingy again. Cavern. You're not doing the voice anymore? Oh, so this is the narrative. The narrative voice is different. Is the dog over there? By Bigby's Hand? I think it's just a myth. Although I had a neighbor with a chihuahua once. They're all bite-y. That means something. This has never happened before. Switch tracks, my friend. Oh no. I'm going to take a run at the first one and I'm going to throw my spear. I am. I pick up that tavern spear and I'm going to throw it. 16 yet again. A four? From your hit points. Your hit points are your hit points. I mean, I would hope so. I've really been excited about the spear so I'm going to run forward and throw my spear. I can move 30. One, two, three, four, five, six... Well, I was going to angle out my little walk a bit to the outskirts. Yeah, out that way more. Right there. Yeah, like there. And I think I can throw it-- Yeah, like a javelin, yes. Why disadvantage? What is my attack with the spear? All right. A seven then, if it's plus two. Well, fine then. I'm going to just sit there and be disappointed then. Okay. What can I do with a bonus action? Can I just do whatever I like? I let you cook, this is your mansion. And my grits are best burnt. Makes them a little crispy. Look at that. That's brilliant. You still have another 200 to give. You're welcome. Yeah, the XB. Is it hard water or soft water I think is what he's asking. I'm going to roll an intelligence check on that. I'm inspecting Scanlan's fountain. Ooh. Is this investigation? Intelligence? All right, then that's a 24. You know, you can make a very nice vegan creme brulee. That's a very good Trinket. That's very impressive. What madness is this?! Nothing happened when we opened the door? Are you sure you're doing it right? It's designed for that; it's a door! I'm going to watch everyone else go through the doorway. I'm going to go through once they've started to go through. I'm going to make sure everything's good. I rolled a 21. Oh, that's right, we didn't go through the door. This is why you never trust a door. I'm curious to hear how this sensation will be narrated. I was curious what kind of hardware is attaching this door to the wall? Is it standard brass brackets? Triple bracket? Does it have a two-way turn? Can you describe this? Can you describe me seeing it for myself? There is lumber and stone. That's quite nice. Well, if you'd said that, I'm letting go and I'm going through the door. I don't think I can go prone. I don't think I can prone. Let me double-check this. I don't think I can. There's no pwning here. Yep. I cannot be knocked prone. That's really mysterious. There's a potted plant. Under the rug? I want to take a look at the square, if that's all right. It could be money for me, because I have it. That is fair, we actually both have it at this point. I'm going to try my door, the square. What sort of five inlaid gems? He may have been. We don't know. We've all got a Grog we don't know about. I want to start running towards where this commotion is. Did you call out? Yes, right there. I'm just going to walk up and slap him with the glove. I'm just going to do a slap. Oh no, with my fancy glove. I'm going to use the fancy glove. Let's see, where is that? Oh no, there's actually a thing for this. Yeah, oh yeah, I have numbers. 23 to hit. And that's 14 points of damage and then he has to make a constitution save or he's stunned. That's very, very pleasing. Is there none on Trinket? Is Trinket-- Oh god, Scanlan's another doppleganger, quick, kill him. I think it was pomegranate sherbet. I think all of us have to be touching one of the doors at the same time. We should surround the tower. Yes, let's all go and touch doors. I'm going to touch a door. Well, since you're already touching a door, I'm going to touch the next door. Well, then I'll go touch-- All right. I'm going to go back to my square. ("Scanlan" voice) Go to the triangle, Scanlan. That's you, that's what you sound like. All the time. Your character in the game talks a bit stupid. Not on four. I'll switch with you, that's fine. I do have circle glasses. Oh my god, I've never heard that before. No one has never made that joke. I can't imagine I've been going my entire life. I will go into my room. Check for traps, check underneath the carpet, check the desk for anything interesting and then I'm going to open my chest. I will. That's terrible. Eight. I'm going to turn around and start slashing at it with my sword. Yes, that's fair. That hits. Yeah, 21 hits. Yes. Five points of piercing damage. All right. I'm going to make three quick slashes with my sword. Oh my god. Two natural 20s. TRAVIS and And a 21. I'm attempting to carve it into a shape, so I'm going to slowly carve it into a lovely standing statuary of Keyleth. May she rest in peace. Quite nice. Quite fitting. Now I'll open my chest. Mimics are the worst. Just made of promises-- Also grappled, I don't know if you can actually move your hands either. You're getting murdered by the touring company of Aladdin. Can I hear any of this? Is there anything-- Is there anything else? Is there anything in the ceiling? Is there anything on the floor? I'm going to back up to the same corner that Vex is in and I'm going to take a couple shots at the hatch, see what happens. Three in quick succession. Two of them crit! It does! I just rolled six times and four times have been critical. I think I'm starting to open this hatch which is in my room. Can everybody hear me? Oh, I've got a hatch in my room and I've got it a bit open at this point. I wonder if there's five hatches? Be rude. That's fine. So rude. My hatch is a bit-- Have you loosened your hatch yet? Union break. How are you doing right now, Scanlan? Not that I know. I shouldn't know. Is that a yummy sound? I've got mine kind of open, if you want to come here. What does any of that mean? It was like you started to say four and said five. It turned into an accent. Mine had a mildly irritated house plant. Are you going to cut a rug, then? 150 XP for the terrible pun. Huzzah! Good to know. I'll take another shot at mine. Hello? Hello? Mine, as well. I'm going to activate my spider boots and head on up there. Natural 20! That resembles the shape of the previous map. I'm going to examine it. It's probably still there. I ignore them. I'm not going to put my hands or feet in any of those holes. Don't touch it, it's evil. I have been waiting for gibbon versus T-rex my entire life! 23. That potion was 4d4? You're going to have to kill it. We have to murder and eat our opponents, it's the only way out. I am going to throw Manners at this creature. Manners, not mana. Let's see, that's a ranged attack roll, that's 30 to hit. My target is restrained. On its turn, it can make a DC 20 strength check to try and get out. At the moment, it's restrained. And while he's restrained, I'm going to walk over and I'm going to burn an action surge. I'm going to stab him with my sword three times. And since he's restrained I think I get a bonus on that, don't I? Let's not waste bullets on anything like this. I'll take three swipes. Is it an auto-crit if they're restrained? I have advantage, okay. So I'll go with that. I don't actually remember. That's one normal hit. 25 to hit. And the last one is 24 to hit. So that's 36 points of piercing damage. And I'm going to breathe deep. I may use my bonus action to take a healing potion. So much math. (squawks) I don't think they make that noise, but-- They are very bird-like. Friendship is magic. Could be worse. I actually should be right in the face of this terrible-- I'm just going to keep stabby, stabby, stabby. With advantage. So, stabby. Yes, that hits. Stabby. Ooh, that's nice. That's crit-- Oh, it's not crit because it's not a gun, it's just a sword. And that's really hard to read, because that's Scanlan's dice. My lowest number is 28 to hit. 36 points of damage. Is he still just doing that, just there? I'm just going to add a little bit of extra damage on there with my Hex. So let's just add five points of lightning damage as well, for fun. 14 points of lightning damage on top of that. Try and mental me or anything? All right. I can do that. Intelligence saving throw, that's 23. Oh no, he's not. He's restrained. I'm just going to keep stabbing him in the face over and over again. I'm just going to stab him three more times. Three more attacks. That's 21 to hit. They all hit. Oh, that's terrible. 28 points of piercing damage. For my bonus action I'm going to retract my little Manners ball, and then I'm going to walk, and attempt to tap the wall to see if it's still standing. I'm actually in the far corner, put me behind the unicorn, please. All right, good. That's the end of my turn. This is everything I've ever wanted. There's a Tyrannosaurus rex and a unicorn that still need to be dealt with. Quite proper. I'm going to go take a look at that body that was sitting in the-- That's not great. 14. How big is this body, approximately? I don't know, take a look. Well, he's unconscious. I think he goes back into the necklace. Who betrayed this grizzly murder? That is peculiar, isn't it? The deception was against her, I think you have to roll separately for us. I'm climbing up the tower. A seven. I mean, it's just walking. I regret nothing. Six. Oh yeah, that whole thing. 28. That hits. That hits. Let me do this. I'm still very reasonable. Let's do a few things. We're right next to each other. You get an attack of opportunity if-- actually, I'm going to use the Cinture of the Stone King to do a shockwave of thunderous energy. I'm going to cast shockwave at level five which is a DC 16. Thunderwave, let me find out. All right, then. Failed save is 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed ten feet away. 2d8 plus five. I hope I'm doing this right. That's 6d8. Boy, this is so much math. Hold on. Sorry. Two, four. Six. And one more. 38 points of damage. And you're pushed ten feet away. So there we are. The next thing that's going to happen is I'm going to burn an action surge and I'm going to shoot you several times. First shot. Oh, I will. There'll be plenty. First shot, I'm going to shoot you in the head. God fucking damn it. My gun jams and I take five points of psychic damage. So that's funny. My gun jams and I'm going to back off to the right about 30 feet. For my bonus, I'm going to heal a little bit and then that's the end of me. Here's 3d8. I thought we had an arrangement. Oh my god, what is that behind you? I turn, and I run, and I attack him! That's 26. That's fine. Quick, what was his son's name? Oh my god! There's a half-conscious Pike we could wake up. And we're willing to do it. That's amazing! I have 150 XP. Six. I've always known you. That's why I will be the one to end you. Soy chicken, but at least it's something. I missed Percy. That was really fun. You did very well. It's panic-inducing back there. It's a lot! Do you have anything taped to the screen? It felt good from this end.
