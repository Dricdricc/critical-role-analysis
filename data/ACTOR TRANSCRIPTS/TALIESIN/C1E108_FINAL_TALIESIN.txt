We do. I would probably be about there. I had my boots on, so I was up by his face. So all of their faces are indented? 16. What do you do, hot shot? Oh yeah, thank you for reminding me. We're pretty metal. I'm going to cry out to everyone we need their heads. Don't hit them in the face, please. I am engaged. I know, there's nothing I can do. I am engaged with that thing, aren't I? I don't know. I'm going to try and take a run in the other direction. I know it's going to take a swing at me. Yep, I'm running down the wall. Yep, as far as I can go. I'll start coming that way, too. Not a full-- it's six spaces., so-- 19 just hits. AC's 18. 34 points? Okay, so hold on, let me do the math on that. (counting) Okay, yeah, I'm at 151 because I had a whole bunch of temporary points. I pull up. I'm going to take my first shot. I'm going to take a straight shot and I'm going to blow a point of grit. We'll get to that, and I'm going to try to get him to drop his sword. First thing is I'm going to try and get him to drop the sword. That's a 34 to hit. Strength save against a 20. Drop your sword. Okay, so that was shot number one. Oh boy, here we go! I've also got to do damage on that, which is-- I'm so sorry, where are all my dice? There we are. Oh, I didn't do that, so none of that. Where are we going? I'm going to drop three points of Cabal into this, as well. Oh, there we are. Six points of psychic damage, four points of lightning damage, and 16 points of standard piercing damage. Animus. Next thing I'm going to do, I'm going to cast Hex on him. Give him disadvantage on strength saving throws. Strength ability checks. And I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot. That's 20? Okay, good to know! Making that note. So I'm going to drop three more points of Cabal into that, so that's 20 points of piercing damage, four points of psychic damage, 13 points of lightning damage, and three points of necrotic damage. And last shot. I'm going to try and push him ten feet back. Natural 20. (cheering) But he got pushed ten feet back. And hey, I get a grit point back. So he's got to move ten feet before he can pick up his sword. And that's everything. Oh, it's going to hurt! Remember you have the temporary hit points. How very Santa Monica. (groaning) Fire good! The one closest to us, or the one on the other side? Oh it's on the ground, okay. I think it's Lost in Space. Welcome to my world, man. I'm going to spend a point of dead-eye to that last one that's on the ground, and I think that cancels out the disadvantage. Yeah, let's just shoot him. Yeah, that's a 27. That's ten points of damage, two points of necrotic, two points of psychic. And do the same. That's 32. What a senseless waste of human life. LAURA and Tarot cards are fine! All of them! Ten points of coffee damage. That's nine points of normal damage, two points of psychic damage, six points of necrotic. And for my third shot. That's 30 points. That's 17 points of normal damage, four points of necrotic, one point of psychic. I want to pour a cup of coffee-- (laughter) I'm going to sit. I've already got him, second time I'm going to find very carefully every little crack, and I'm going to get him in there. I'm going to listen to them bang around on the interior. I'm going to rattle them around. It's going to be fine. Holy cow. I have a coffee problem. You would think, and I've been drinking it all night. I don't know! Ignore me. We can always put it underneath the smelter and pour in. We've got to do all three heads. We have the platinum. Let's see what happens. Let's smelt the platinum into the heads. I think we're going to put all three into the one. That'll do. Let's try this. Okay, so if we fit these together-- Does this now make another concave piece? So I've still got some Spider Climb, so I'm going to grab one and lift up. All the fliers? Are the coals hot or are the coals cold? I want to see if there's anything in the holes that were left by the soldiers who left. The three suits of armor came out of the wall, so there's now a wall that we haven't seen behind them. I'm going to do all three, but I'll start on the one on the left. That's investigation check. What did you do? Six. Yeah, it's also a three. So when three pieces go together the part that goes towards the wall-- All right, it is a pyramid, so the whole pyramid goes in the wall. Why would it be gold? That's true. I have one other thought. What's the red armor made out of? I can take a look. What would that be? So that's intelligence plus my normal tinker check? So that's not bad. Let's see. Oh wow! That's 32. Only in a glass volcano. No, I think it will melt. We can give it a shot, can't we? That's a terrible idea. Let's try gold. I would have felt very foolish. We'll try the gold. I'm pulling it out. It's going to be another door. No. No, I never saw National Treasure. Okay, well we'll make an evening of it. I know, it's a lot of sound. We don't even notice him leave. Be bold. We're going to have to get his attention somehow. It's a crazy plan, but it just might work. Gef√ºlten. Yes, I speak Celestial. (laughs) You can bury that as deep as you want. Well, you know, it's like a whole thing. Yeah, it's would be dex or strength. In Celestial, I'm going to say hello. I'm going to say it out. Hello? We come seeking the Allhammer. We need help. Vecna walks the earth again. We come seeking a way to defeat him once again. We come with the blessings of Pelor. And I'm going to start entering, very gingerly. Grog. I keep walking. We ask permission to use the anvil. That's fair. Man, I could really use Spider Climb right now, goddamn it. What kind of runes? 11. Okay. Do we have our bits of god? We might want to have them available for the moment. I kept track of which one was the hammer. Is he another golem? I'm going to try and sneak around the side of it. What's behind it? 19. Are those bellows or is it more complicated? What would happen if we put that machine out? I think that it feels like a guardian. What if we put the water elemental in the-- I want to put the engineering behind it out. I want to put those pistons out. And I was wearing it yesterday. A more masculine cut of this exact shirt. Not that exact shirt, but another one very similar to it. You can get a pin, you can get a hoodie, you can get any form you want. 24. What? You're not? Okay. Oh. Six? I'm going to bake a pie and deliver it-- okay, I'm going to run back towards that red crystal. Yep. I run that direction, and then I'm going to use my bonus action to do that. I'm going to hold my attack until his attack. This is really intimidating. The crystals are glowing, and it makes me unhappy. Is your crystal red, too? (gasping) Okay. So if he's going to do this, I was holding my attack. I'm taking my attack now right before this happens. He has no face, does he? There's no face. So if I were to make a head attack, that would probably be really goddamn useless. One way to find out. Maybe it's a mask. Fire a grit. To hide his shame. Do I add the d4 to this, if I so am inclined? And I can do it every time? Oh wow, this is so nuts. So first attack. Out of curiosity, does it keep my misfire? Does it knock me out of misfire, technically? Goddamn it. Okay. Let's put that away, then, and let's take some psychic damage, because that's funny. Oh, that's great. Okay. Yeah, so 142, that's cool. Ow. I'm going to put that down and get a bigger gun and try that again. And that blows that grit, as well. Much better! No, it's not. Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. It's just doing it. Never mind. I'm going to blow the rest of it and spend the end of my turn trying to fix one of my guns really quickly, and do a quick clear-out. Which is 12 versus misfire on the psychic. And I do! I cleared Animus. Bad News is still out of commission. And that's my turn. Never mind. And you took 28 points. What?! Okay. Good to know. There's a lot of fires to put out, I guess. Not like he was really-- I was going to say, can you dissipate it? Oh. That's okay. You could kind of do that. You don't get to save against this, does he? So first thing I'm going to do is get a quick little heal bonus going, because why not. Let's do a heal. So that's 14 points up, so I'm 156. A little bit better, and that's my heal. I'm noticing that this thing's only taking magic damage. The hammer it dropped is underneath the planetar right now, right? I'm going to run in that direction. Molten metal and rock? I can't jump that, can I? Not an acrobatics check, I take it? But there are chains that I can reach there? Well, I'm going to attempt to grab the hammer. If it's available for a swing, I'll try for a swing. Roll with advantage? Athletics? Natural 20. (cheering) This is the hammer chain? So am I touching the hammer right now? But it's not a magic hammer, it's just a really nice hammer. Yeah, I'm going to take a moment to look at it. I've got an action, still. Yeah, I'll use my action to admire the hammer. No. I have an arcana of seven. God fucking damn it. Okay, I'm hopping off, then. Yeah, all right. I'm over there, hiding. Fuck. Technically, it'll lower slightly lower than where it's supposed to be, because it doesn't just halve the doubling of the dice. You got an arrow, which didn't probably do any physical-- We can still do that. Oh shit. Is that including your dex save? Oh, wow. Oh man. This is so bad. Here's the question. I should know this how quickly can these things be made? You could grab the hammer. I don't know. Maybe it's a control hammer. I don't know. I'm grasping at fucking straws here. You've got actions. Grabbing that hammer is definitely an option. I let go. Plus a d4. God fucking damn it. The rest are other tools. With a d4. I feel like we're missing at something really hard. I'm going to run all the way back to the back of the room, I'm going to put as much distance-- well, actually I'll take my shots first. I've got Animus up, so I'm going to spend a point on it. I'm running out of grit. And I'm going to try and take a shot on this guy. 36. That hits, I assume, so that's 1d10 plus 1d6, and then I'm also going to blow the last of my lightning into that, as well. That's 18 points of standard damage, two points of psychic damage, and 15 points of lightning damage. That's one shot. This is my last advantage shot. I'm going to take another advantage shot on him. Here we go. That's 24 on the advantage shot. Here we go. 15 points of damage plus three points of psychic damage. I should start taking track of this. Shooting again, no advantage. 20. I'm going to burn an action surge and take three more shots. And I'll roll 3d20. Actually, hold on. No, it wouldn't matter. 22, yeah it doesn't actually hit. So here we go. Taking three shots. Oh my god! So this is great. I take three more shots. First one is 29, so that hits. No, they did not. So this is going to be fine. I did roll the other two. 19 and 19, which are both criticals. I got two criticals that we're going to get into. First shot is not a critical. That's 12 points of damage and one point of psychic damage. And then let me get an extra d10 and an extra d6. This is weird. New critical. New type of critical. Critical damage. That's 11 points of psychic damage. Yeah! And 20 points of normal damage. 20 normal and 11 points of psychic. And now the next critical hit. Oh my god. That's a terrible roll. That's okay. 12 points of normal damage and six points of psychic damage. And so the two of those combined, cut in half, is what he takes next round's bleed damage. I'm running in the opposite direction! Oh, and that's two crits, which means I get two grits back. I'm like (grunts) that way. This is just what you're going to be doing. You can move. You have a bonus action. Oh, that also means he takes his bleed damage this turn. I'm so excited by how you're doing this here. This is some crazy shit. It's a blind elemental Yeah, and the minute you take your turn, you can make a reckless attack. Don't say "let's see." I was going to say, you are the heavy damage dealer so far. Oh, but you're not blind anymore. Oh, that's right. You avoided it. That's okay. Let's not test that. Reroll ones? Taking three shots. And that's a 34 to hit. Anything that didn't hit, I'm going to run Bless. So that's 15 points of damage, five points psychic. That's 24. That misses, and then the other one misses. Burning an action surge for three more shots. Burning a grit for advantage. So advantage number one is a 17 to hit. 26, that hits? Let's put that away; that's not helpful anymore. That's 13 points of damage, two points psychic. Next advantage shot. That's a natural 20. That's seven points of psychic damage. Oh shit. That's 28 points of piercing damage. Plus seven points psychic. Half that damage, next round. Total, (counting) that's 34. Next round, on its turn. I'm burning another grit for my final shot. Yeah, I can do a lot of things with it, but he's so big, this is my best shot, because his AC is so fucking high. That's 31 to hit. And that's 16 points of damage and one point of psychic damage. And I'm running towards that fire pit, straight back. I can't whirl around it? That'll do. Is he blind? Is he still blind? Gnome-kicking is a time-honored tradition. Knock it off! God fucking damn it. Do you re-roll those? Sam, your inspiration is a long rest recharge, not a short rest, right? Oh! If we take a short rest, he can inspire us when we do this. I want to sit down. We do need to discuss this. 18. And now I'm up to top again, and it only took two hit dice. And then I get my heal back. I get my action surges back. Grit comes back on a short rest. I'm going to really quickly fix Bad News. All right, I fixed Bad News. Wow. And so many things don't work anymore. Okay. Yeah. Oh, my Hex is burned, my Spider Climb's burned, Diplomacy is a long rest before that goes again. No, I know how to do it. We're going to have to smelt them. We're going to have to start with smelting them. Well, I don't know. You know the process, I don't. Why am I in character talking to the dungeon master? What's happening? Ah, the meta. Put that one away. Bigby isn't, though. We hurry to the other room. If we can get any inspiration, too, before we start this process. Let's just smelt for now. At which you have advantage. Yeah, figure out what dex plus proficiency. Whatever your dex plus prof is. How long does inspiration last for? Let's wait until the final-- There's probably everything we need in here if we take a look around. We're going to need water. One at a time. With advantage. No. Let's just do it. Advantage. Can I help with this? Oh god. Okay. Advantage and inspiration. He already rolled. Well, let's see. What do I have to do? Make an investigation check? Glad I got that roll out of the way. I'm going to try picking the hammer up. I'm going to try and attune to it. I'm going to examine it. Make another arcana check. Let's see what happens. Oh, that's better. 21. I'll drop Animus for now. Well, technically that's a dex check, so if you have Cat's Grace I'll take it. If you have any inspiration, I'll also take it. That's without inspiration. That's 31. I might be able to inspiration this because that was a really bad roll. Both of them are the same. Both of them are two. And this is not one of those things where I can fix. It's either good or it's bad. I'm going to try and add a little bit of inspiration, maybe. That's not very good. That's 17. Can I get one more inspiration if you got any? Are you out? Let's take another one. Just in case because Jesus fucking Christ. Okay. Please. I will happily take that inspiration, please. It's a skill check. It's not a save. Oh wait. I don't get to add anything from the hammer for this? I think it has to be soft, right? I think we have to do it now, right? Give me one more inspiration if you can, and we'll see where we go. I don't feel good. That'll do. 18, 28, 30. That's not bad. Yeah! So that's 34! (cheering) And I faint. (laughter) Well, I think we'll assume that we're going to take a mansion rest and we'll come out of a mansion rest. Can we assume that's going to be it? So we can Plane Shift, mansion wherever we need. Are we going straight to him? All right. Mansion. So let's Plane Shift somewhere and mansion. We need to rest. Let's rest. Yeah, ignore it.
