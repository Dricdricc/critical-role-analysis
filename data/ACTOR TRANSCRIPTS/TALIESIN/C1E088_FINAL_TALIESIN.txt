It's the 'build' theme. This was a great decision. Oh, no there's not! Oh my god, I got the Spaceman. Which one did you get? It's what's-his-name. It's Liam Neeson. I'll trade you a Cyborg for a Spaceman. Oh my god, this is actually-- No, that's Power Rangers. That's not Voltron, man. I know. Yeah, I did, but I'll show it off again. It's a really awesome Power Rangers shirt, with the classic Megazord. Who are you gonna believe? Guy with the comic book show? I may have a small. Let me find out. This feels small. I've got a large, never mind. Oh, this is really cool, look at that. You should definitely read that. You should definitely, definitely read that. Please read that. I'm not even kidding. Read that. You, read it. Like, on the break, read it. Good pronunciation. I sent the announcement sheet to you. Well no, I remember some of them. I do. Wednesday at noon to two on this very Twitch channel, is the Wednesday Club, and this week we're gonna be talking about Image Comics, which is now about 25 years old. This is the thing, and we're gonna talk about how they started and why it's important, and then all the cool stuff they're doing today, which is some really cool stuff. Good books. Hello. Sea cows. The worst of like five worlds. Oh, yeah. Oh, please. We're all on board. Turn Trinket into a-- Okay, okay. Gotta put the foot down before this gets weird. We're not doing Hero's Brunch? I don't know how my guns are going to work underwater. At least 30 minutes. You'll just get a cramp. You have to sleep with a glass of water by the bed. We could try to craft some goggles. Yeah, they are for close up, but they're not attached to my-- water could get in. Yes. Yeah, I'll put them in, I've got a pocket. My big question is, what am I going to do with my guns? I'm gonna have to look up my first range increment Unless we web. Or turn into dolphins, or-- Swordfish. Eels. Electric eels. Not that I don't know this isn't going to work, but I'm going to try and see if I can get, even with like maybe an electric pulse, if I can light the powder. If the powder's wet, the powder's wet. Once I open that thing-- They're not going to function underwater. It's okay. No, I'd be worried if they did. So there's no way to put a bubble around me or anything, is there? Like some sort of bubble. Or I could even put the tip of the gun out of the bubble. And fire, but as long-- the combustion has to happen in air. How do you even know all this? Not me, just the firearm. Well, if I could have it around just the combustion point, and have the barrel sticking out of the point, that might be a thing. Out of what? We're not taking apart the bear. Okay, I've got a crazy idea. I wanna, I wanna build-- I wanna build a watertight vest for the guns. Basically just a packet that keeps that section dry. Like a protective-- like a soft bag that is waterproof, that would use some sort of stomach lining of some animal or some leather to build it. I couldn't reload the gun. One shot, or would it just be one shot-- yeah, 'cause it might-- Well, like it would-- just around everything but the-- well, the barrel would then have to be-- That's-- One shot each. I'm going to need some way of defending myself or I'm going to have to take an animal form. I may have to have an animal form. It's kind of small, isn't it? A very friendly yellow fish. I was thinking maybe some sort of half-octopus merperson. They could take down a ship, right? He's catching on. When I'm an animal, none of my bonuses-- My bonuses stay. So, my vestige will actually-- We'll find out, I suppose. If the vestiges will be functional while I'm in animal form. I'm turning into one. They're not actually whales. They're orca. They-- yeah, like with cool tattooing. Look, we can have different animals. Like, he can shark and I can whale. If we throw a little bit of rope together, we can make some quick harnesses, including harnesses that include a little bit of a netting for the stones as we get them. Well, those of us who can swim quite quickly will try and evade. We'll try and hide and keep looking for them. Diversion, scatter, grab, and run. That's about right. Pretty good. Well, that's the thing about these sorts of encounters, is that any plan you have is pretty much going to be out the window the minute you see it anyway. Half more a plan than we normally have. It's much like those people who give you instructions of how to survive an encounter with a tiger. It's that, you think about it, but you've never actually met anybody who's said, "Yes, I've met a tiger, that's exactly what I did and I'm fine." No, anybody who does that's probably been eaten anyway. It's a terrible idea. You don't try and look bigger, you don't do any of that. You're gonna get eaten. You survive an encounter by a tiger by running really quickly in the other direction or hopefully hacking it to death before it kills you. Well, it was just my suggestion. Let's see, what can we do? Maybe-- we have one night. Maybe I could try and craft some sort of concussion explosive. It wouldn't probably hurt it, but it would at least maybe shock it. Give it a-- stun it? To just blow something up underwater? Well, all right. Very clever. You wanna ride the lightning. It's okay, it's an animal that already has a black eye. To be fair, no worse than anything that happens to a killer whale at SeaWorld at that point. Yeah, I went there, I'm so sorry. It's been there, I'm sorry! My personal alignment is already so far down. Sorry! Shit got real on Critical Role. Yeah. Oh no, I know what-- I know where my money is going at the end of the evening. They have a different larynx system. (laughs) Wet-erase boards. (all laugh) Make a skin. I was gonna say we could make a diving bell. But it would be very hard to travel with, but we could make a micro diving bell. It's basically an upside-down pot that you stick your head in and you take a big breath of air, but the problem is moving with it is bad. Whales. Or a shark. You might want to go shark for one of them. Especially if it's just handles, if it's just like hanging onto a piece of rope. A Heroes' Sundae Bar. (sings Zelda music) That's cocked. 11 hit points Wisdom saves. Advantage. No fear. No poison. Are they heavy or are they light? Vox Machina, solving problems that don't need to be solved. I put my ear in the water to see if I can hear him. Yes. Best of the best. It does. Hello, water-based culture, would you happen to have some goggles lying around we could borrow, maybe something that's to communicate underwater, I don't know? I was actually just contemplating that, because you know how frustrated you get opening up a crab when you're going to eat it-- I wonder, would it be ironic if the kraken gets frustrated trying to peel off the armor? It'd just be a wonderful irony. I'm so sorry, sir. No. I don't know. Let's-- Just not reflective. That's a very fair point. He is not wrong, and that's not a bad idea. Fun. Scary fun. Technically speaking, we can't quite feel fear at the moment, can we? Or is it just a general malaise of fear? (all laugh) I have a thing just for you. Just for you! Pass that down later. I'm collecting some seashells, and taking a bit of a walk. And eventually, we're chilling. Are we bringing the bear? We're bringing the bear. All right. Is it possible to grab a spare set of goggles and choker, just in case? We'll return them all. Thank you. Excellent. Three. I've already got a small bag of them, if you want to keep them-- We could trade later. Also a skipping stone. You didn't think of that, did you? If it's hairy, we won't need Pass Without a Trace at all. We've got a plan. I'm going to be a whale, we've got some rope here, it's going to be your job once I'm a whale to create at least a couple handholds with a harness. You know how to use knots, right, you can do some basic-- I knew you would. Keep going. The Dallas two-step. The sweet Caroline? Good for tension. I'm also gonna grab-- I should not be allowed to drink this. I'm going to take you aside really quickly and give you the extra set of goggles and the bead. Just in case. I'm-- you know how I get with my hunches. You'll know, if we need them, we have them. Just an extra set. I'll take one just in case. Well. That was everything I could've hoped for. At first, yes. Sure. Oh, now we're really in trouble. I love it. The rusty Doty's another knot that you know. Kind of a natural jade? How heavy are they? They're magnetic? I don't, but I can fake one pretty quickly if we have to. We never needed a compass. Is it possible-- well, we're too deep now, but-- You have a compass, don't you? And I'm going to hand it back to him. This is going to be weird. I'm going to take out a chunk of Whitestone residuum and just compare the color and see if there's any relation. Look at my sheet. That's a natural 20. (all cheer) It actually occurs to me that I might have some magnets on my person. Can I make an investigation check? I had quietly in my head been using them to keep my coat down when I was running around with the spider boots. I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true. Can I make a roll to see if I happen to have some on me? Yeah. They might help with-- I'm going to try and see if I can use them as a very base dowsing rod for these stones. Okay. In my head, you have zinc all over your nose. There's just zinc. Yes, we're really pale people, this is probably a good idea. No. The navigator, yes. I feel comfortable. We have Locate Object, we have a compass. I'm a science man! They can't see the map yet. Aberrations An animal. They're not really aberrations. That was weirdly helpful. That's really, genuinely helpful. (all laugh) (garbled voice) Why are you doing this with your face? I'm not entirely sure the creatures down here have eyes. I'm going to examine the sand, and just gently dig around to see what's around. This is fascinating, I'm just digging for whatever. Good to know. There's a red filter. You do have a red filter? If we have to use an opal we can. So, we can be far away when we activate it. Let's not cast it near the portal, though. Very good. Filing it away. Let's see how we feel? Everybody knows about the sea bear. When it's time. Anyone ever seen Bedknobs and Broomsticks? Okay. Stealth checks. Yay. I'm so sorry for doing that to you. It was really unfair. Plus ten? 33. Hut hut! They get the job done He kind of looks like kelp -- -- maybe he's blending It's just a face in a giant brown--TALIESIN,  (Darth Vader-esque breathing effect), MARISHA, MARISHA Let's hunt some scallops. That'll do. 20. This was for a larger creature, like, giants? Did these ruins crumble, or did they sink? And is the stone-- does the stone feel natural, or does it feel like stone that would be underwater? Does it look like the parts of it that have been underwater are doing well, or does it look like it's eroding as something that should've been above the surface? And there's no writing visible. Okay. Compass. I'm with you. I'm going to gently pat at the base of the wall. Not disturbing anything. Investigation? 13. Very gently. If anything we're sucking at this. Shh! I think we put it in the bag of holding and it won't matter. I imagine like Neil Armstrong. Let's curl around. 33. Plus ten. We're going around. No, I perceive nothing. One. I saw nothing. No. They don't. As far as I know. I'll help. 13. This Philip Glass nervous breakdown you're giving us is really-- We think we find him and it's just a rock. Rock. Ugh. Nine. Shh. Oh no. God damn it. Yeah, you could've used Luck. 17. Not cool. Yeah, he is very pretty. Coldstone? That's a great idea! I don't get any-- my cloak doesn't get any bonus against this, does it? That's better! 23. (imitating Oprah) You take 18 points of lightning damage! It's a really good meatball. So that way it'll stay lit over there. I'm gonna use my bonus action to cast Hex on the kraken. I'm gonna Hex the kraken. No, I just want to know where it is. There's nothing I can do to it. I literally have only one power, and that's to electrocute it, which does nothing. Really good. They're really good and they're a problem. I'm going to dig the lodestone out of the dirt. I'm gonna spend my turn keeping an eye on the thing I just Hexed so I know where it is. And I'm also turning to Tary and going, (whispers) find the next one, we've gotta get out of here. Yeah, once I've got the lodestone, I wanna-- well, I don't have the bag. I'm gonna put it in Tary's bag. And I'm gonna try and see if I can get some cover, as far away from that thing as possible. Whatever I can do. Yeah. Fuck you. I'm not happy with any of this. How can I? You did this to me. Oh yeah, that hits. Not speaking as Percy, this is legitimately nightmare fuel right now. I'm not sleeping tonight. I do, I have a-- Shh! Don't tell the internet, they'll find-- Okay. Oh no. It can regrow tentacles. You should see a doctor about that. This is monstrous. Like Velcro pants. Hypnotic pattern? Like a boy scout! Bravery! Wasn't it easier when you just had to rhyme? It's nice to see someone else going through this. He's not a pirate. Arr. I'm fine. Three of them. Oh god, I want to die. Please help. There from you. Yeah, that's really confusing. On a fundamental level. Eh. Get Taryon out of the kraken's grasp with Grasping Vine. Oh no. Ooh! Drop it, drop it! All over again. Nope. Don't say it. 21. God damn it! That's a 19. Yay! 23! That'll do. Okay. Yeah, I'm going to try and-- is acrobatics a way to get out of this? I'll take acrobatics. (all laugh) All right, so here go. Let's roll well. I get advantage on this, right? Okay, just thought I'd see if I could sneak that through. I rolled a really-- I can't reroll that with Resolve can I? No, 'cause it's not a save. 16. Do I have anything-- with anything else, do I have anything I can do? Is there a bonus action thing I can do here? No, I am just-- yeah. I think about how easy it would be to reload my gun right now if I had one. That's-- yeah. #blessed. You hit a creature from inside of it-- There's literally nowhere your fists could go that wouldn't hit it. How do you get un-swallowed? We'll resuscitate the kraken if it comes to it. If we have to resuscitate a kraken-- TALIESIN and Grappling with many things. Keep fucking with him. Thanks, chat room. I'm sure chat room was. You don't need no stinkin' patches. Take you to a goth club. Yeah. Worth it. That'll help. Oh. I like that we all keep doing that with the fingers. She does. She found the next one. Sure. Augh. Oh my god. I am not having a happy time. 11 points? Oh, I have a saving throw, constitution-- I have a concentration-- No. We are. Grog is in the belly of the beast. He's happy. He's in a better place. Yep. Here to help. It's like watching creamer in coffee in reverse. (sings) God damn it. Thank you for that. It's good. Nothing bad happened. If only we'd brought your robot. Player's Handbook says a lot of things, doesn't it? Do you have creature statistics, DM? We're gonna get little fey minnows. Full-contact stats. There's shade being thrown in every direction tonight, isn't there? They sing like Disney characters. They braid your hair for a bonus action. Have we finally broken Mercer? Wait, I can do this. It's a hunter shark, but it's fey because it's dyed its hair with a pastel pattern. Caramel. Caramel. Ow. Yeah, no, we're in. This is how he's been plotting our death. You know, I'm not having any luck getting out of this thing. Ah, god. And I get the distinct impression that the whole point of this creature is there's just no escaping it. I'm gonna start trying to cut my way out of this thing. I give up. I'm cutting my way out. No. I'm gonna use my longsword. Attack with disadvantage. I can't, it's just gonna-- Yeah, it's just a tentacle. With the intent to leave. Oh, that's not bad. 23. Okay. I do not have Hex anymore, so that's-- 13. And another attack. Also 23. Also 13. And again. 28. Yes, they're both 16s. I know. It's a metaphor. Oh. 15. Drop it, drop it, drop it! I am booking towards the big red-- No, the other way. I'm booking that way. Yeah. Oh, and it's not red! Oh, that's so weird. I'm heading the opposite direction of that fucking nightmare monstrosity. Yes. I'm gonna get behind that boulder and hide, if possible. Bonus action to hide, or no? So for my bonus action-- Is Minor Illusion a bonus action or not? I can't remember, I haven't done it in so long. And I'm feeling so useless. Yeah. Oh, I'm gonna use-- I have a heal. I'm gonna heal. I'll use my bonus action to heal. 1d10 plus 12. Where's a d10? That's not bad. Okay, 18 points. Okay, good, I get 18 points back, yay. Yeah, that hits. 26 points of bludgeoning damage? Yeah, that's fine. Oh god. You are annoyingly cheerful. There's no room for anything else in there. Does it ever not hit? Whoever actually succeeded in changing anything from the inside? Let's be honest here. You become part of it. Just know somehow that this is a metaphor. For what? This is bad. Ew. Unless you're a cod. Grease me up! For all the good it did me. What. What. What. Did you just grease? Did you just grease that with tears? Clink. I'm going to gaze at him, as a professional gazer. I'm going to gaze at Taryon. And just allow my head wound to just bleed out. I hate you. And you. Throw a knife. Does it have a limited number of tentacles? But if we keep playing it may have eight, then seven, then six. The Grog and Keyleth show? I would watch that. You didn't pour it. There's options. You put that kraken on Hot Pepper Gaming. Lode liquid. Hashtag. We will save the kraken. Oh wow, a lot happened there. Yes! Good jug. Yeah! I love everything that's happening. And the kraken. You're alive! What are the chances it dropped any of us while this happened? Nothing. Kinda what I was expecting, to be magnificently frank. Oh, god. God damn it. From the tentacles. Three. 18. And she's out! Just barely. God damn it. We've got all three. Yes. Bite the tentacles. Aren't you unconscious? Fuck, man. (groans of pain) Okay. Okay. I'm going to-- Hm? I know, she's making us feel really guilty right now. I'm going to hack away at this thing right now, so I'm going to try and hack away at this tentacle to get out. Disadvantage, correct? God, I'm really not enjoying this. That's a 17. 19? I know that natural 20 is just going to waste. 13. And I'll take another one, that's not going to roll well, here we go. My third hit is 16. So I'm going to burn my Action Surge and I'm going to take the Alter Self. That coin you gave me is-- What does it give me, just full movement? Yeah, so I burn my Action Surge for that. I'm going to go find my healing potions to find out what I have, but I'm going to do that-- yep, moving right along. Yeah. Fuck. We really need to leave badly. No? Does the shark? At disadvantage? 15. 15. 4d4. Yeah we're running, running. Better. Water wings. Yes! Yes! Yeah. Normal? No, it would be a normal, or like a swimming creature, though, what's the speed of a swimming creature? Thea Therpent. (lisp) Help me, Cecil, help! Let's go whale. The giant snake is a land snake is the problem. Let's be whales. We'll do it live! Mine has glasses. Wait. Electric eels-- if they're electric eels-- Constitution saving throw? Aha! Ah! Ah! What is happening? I-- man, nothing makes sense anymore. Good shark. I figure since I'm an eel, I'm gonna attack this thing. I think I've got a shot. Ahaha. Sorry. This is the Winnie the Pooh of krakens. It's just trying its mild calisthenics to just try and make things. And it tickles. I am going to book, double speed-- I'm going to book through this weird little log. I'm going to go straight through it. Ahh. Wait, wait, right in the eye. Right in the eye. Very clever eel. Yeah! He's got the dagger, though. It's not a giant eel, it's just an eel. I can kill an eel. Anybody can. No. No, we're not arguing. No that's a kitten, have two hit points. Snakes have, like, six. Yeah, we're ten-hit-point eels. That's fair. They have flying snake? Never mind, I don't want to know. It happens. Neal the eel. We can bring it back. Are we down three tentacles now? Add a d4. You're awake. Could have had a d8. Leave it armless. Are you getting hit in the head? It's very hard to see from this-- I will say-- --this map is a nightmare. More kraken. Oh my god, you actually have a mini for that one. Aw, god damn it. 23. Yeah! It's doing a big like (raspberry). Everyone. That acid's gotta be-- burn through that at some point. Is that a continuing-- Damn it. One less. Good shark. d4. They go down-- they go down fast, though. I am booking double speed to that door, 'cause I am useless-- And I'm also-- I've got form this-- so I'm full speed. Fins and gills. Alter Self. I am holding-- I am just, like, waiting on the other end for everybody. --who tells our story. I'm just so useless in this fight. Do you have-- do you have a Hail Mary? This is-- wow. Do you have a bonus action? Anything you can-- It only has one more tentacle left that is available. It can have no tentacles. It can still feed. They'll grow back. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh, that's good! Okay, yeah, that's really hard to see, sorry, 'cause of the light. That's a 17. That is a 17, yes. Drinking again. Vax. Yeah. I'm not there. For 12. Six plus two. You're at one hit point, you're at one hit point. Yes. You're at zero. Never mind. Fuck. Okay. It's gonna come down to Grog. You don't have-- How long-- Can I see what's going on? And it's only been six seconds. No. (inhales) I'm gonna try and-- how far do I have on that? I'm gonna try and stick my head through the portal. I'm gonna try and cast Minor Illusion? In front of the beast? It can't be complicated, can it? It's gotta be small. It's a cantrip, so it's nothing. It's nothing fancy. I'm just gonna try and make a big meaty target appear. Just like a thing that looks like-- I'm gonna try and do like the shape of some aquatic animal? A small-- anything to try and get right in its face? God damn it. I got-- Other than-- Yeah, I got nothing. Other than trying to distract it. Yeah. I pull back through the portal, obviously, but. Is Tary-- Tary's still held on? (groans) Good! Good! I approve of this. They do, but-- And Trinket runs. Well, and she's unconscious. How many tentacles does the kraken have now? Only one-- I mean, it's not like you're saving them by not hitting them at this point Yeah, no matter what you do. Kraken ain't dying. Kraken got ten thousand hit points. He's not even vaguely dying. Thank god! Yeah, but we are out of options! I am totally okay with a Hail Mary. Want some d6s? Or are you okay? If you do enough damage to it, it may vomit them out. Do you have-- yeah, and the tentacles don't get a Prismatic Spray of their own? Oh, man. A Patch Addams. It's just jerky you've sewn into you. (groans) Nope, straight. Yeah. Yeah. No, it fires electricity. I'm going to hold my action for-- -- for the vague hope of something useful. To attack-- I've already burned it, and it laughed it off. Just to attack the kraken-- If it gets close enough, just sword, just-- Oh, god. You'll decrease the resale value of these books with how much you've been cracking the spines tonight. I'm just saying. Got to get a healing potion in that guy stat. Get it, get it in him. Ah, fuck. But if you can heal him for a point-- In any way possible-- Okay. This is not good, people. I am very far away, right now. I'm gonna get you a new d20 soon. Everyone but you-- Dexterity saving throw. You're not there. I'm-- There is nothing I can do. I already, I just-- -- there's literally nothing I can do. I am staring you in the deadeye-- We need the-- (sigh) we need the fucking lodestone. Lodestone! How far is Tary from the-- how many feet is Tary from the portal? 40 feet? What's my running speed? What's my running speed? Okay. (deep sigh) God damn it. I've already taken it. I don't have a potion of haste! I have a healing potion. I have a healing potion. Fuck. I don't know what the fuck to do. 60. Yeah, I'm not going to survive one round in there. I'm 16 points. Yeah, there's no-- is Grog looking rough? You're looking fine? I'm just going to scowl at you. I'm actually, fuck it! I have something I can do! I'm gonna cast Friends on Grog. Just toss the nitwit through the door! No, I'm begging! Yes. With advantage, that was cocked, though, was it? Okay. Yeah, it was 20. Natural 20. Toss the nitwit through the door. Yeah. I'm good. I'm good. I love you. I'm so proud of you. That's what I said. I think it's-- I can't take it back, what I said. I'm well aware. I can start to argue with you if you start to do something stupid, which is fine. You might. I'm not gonna-- Ah, god damn it. Oh, shit. You have full speed now. So you can double-speed if you want. I'm not gonna fight you no matter what. You feel like I had a point. That's one good one. You get a success. Is it mine? Fuck. God damn it. I am just going to lean out the fucking door and take three attacks at a tentacle and run back in. Since he's right there! There's no tentacle in the range? In that case, I'm going to run out, grab and help drag everybody through the portal if I can. Be cool. You're going to be fine. You won't know for a while. And I'm-- healing potion. I've got a minor. I do. I've got a minor left that I haven't burned. 2d4 plus what? So that's six. Now, I'm standing at the portal ready to, yeah. He got nothing. God damn it! God fucking damn it! God fucking damn it. Okay. Things! I hand you my glasses and fall down. I think he should just-- I don't feel good. Yeah, I feel a little nauseous, and it's not just the kraken. Thanks, Loot Crate, for the robot and the Legos. I was going to make a running, yeah. I was not willing to, yeah. I was not going to walk. I had a thought, but it was a bad thought. I'm really glad I didn't have to go with that bad thought. I want to cry.
