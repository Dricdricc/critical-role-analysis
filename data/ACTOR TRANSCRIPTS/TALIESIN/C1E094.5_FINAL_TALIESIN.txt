Just see me out back. Oh yeah. This week on Wednesday Club, we thought it would be fun to delve into manga! That's right, there's a new camera here, that's crazy. I know. Yeah, it's like the HAL 9000. We're going to be talking about manga. It's going to be a lot of fun. Join us, we may have a guest, we may not, I'm not entirely sure. I've just been so delighted by this, I've ignored everything else in my life. Wednesdays at noon on this very channel, where you are right now. Come check it out. Liam and Sundry. It's basically Butters Stotch. I'm screwed. You're figuring that out now? Can I have a moment to myself? (laughter) Sam?! No, I've YouTubed you. This makes sense. What, and-- Laura! Where's everybody else? Okay. I'm grabbing it. I got a two-- ten. I got a ten.There was Conan O'Brien! Looking around, we're still in that cube, right? Contention point, are we wearing kid clothes? Are we wearing kid clothes or tiny versions of our old clothes? Okay. Just checking. Kind of curious. All right. I think that's sound advice. 19. Thank you. Yeah, it's nice. She's the Sheriff. Did you not watch television as a child? Good god. I'll help. Yeah. We don't have anything from before. I grab a stick. We hide. Does this stuff have a planty smell, or kind of a meaty smell? Is it a bit of a meaty smell? Oh no.Yes, I have. The Centennial flower. Quick game. Ten. Ten, Taliesin. You know, I think I'm going to run, too, at this point. I'm going to keep this stick, but I'm running. (yell) (laughter) You have a lasso at your house, too, don't you? Yeah. Let's check it out! I'm heading over. I'm going to be careful where I'm walking. I'm not being super sneaky, no. He'll see me coming. What? I feel like we needed an adult here. I'm going to go check out the plant he was hitting. Where are the others? I start peeling that thing open and try to pull her out. It's fine! Help me! Natural 20. Matt, are you okay? (laughing) I'm coming to get you, Liam! Hold on! I'm going to start pulling him out, too. Travis, help out! I'm pulling the Hawaiian shirt out of there. I'm going to start using the stick to wedge him out. That's fine. No advantage? That's fine. Just a strength roll? Doesn't matter, it's just a d20, I suppose. No plus? That's a one. Please. I give up and roll down and try to wake Marisha up. Wake up, there's a lot going on! Mr. Mom. You know exactly who I am. Now I'm really confused. Hi. It's Taliesin. You're a teenager. I point at the Hawaiian shirt and Travis. Are you pulling by this point? There's a lot going on. I don't know. Help. Oh my god. Liam, that's so solid! I know exactly what picture they used for this! That's amazing. I was a tiny child. I was a tiny, tiny child. A few of us were working all the time. So nice of you. Pushed in time? You guys were there! There was that booming sound earlier. Turgid. Hey! I'll go with it, and I have the stick, I'm just going to be like-- You're really enjoying this way too much. Six. Which is about what I could get hired to play at that age. Natural 20. Damn it! 19. Because of negative one. I'm going to peek around and see all this and take a look at what's going down here. And the one that's closest to Matt and Marisha? I have some vague memories of where we just came from. I'm going to see if any of this still works? Do I have any of that weird-- I mean, I was already-- I want to reach down into the ground, and see if I can just-- I'm just going to try and reach out at that first cat and see if I can hit it with a little bit of the Chill Touch. I want to see if I can make those tendrils form again. Chill Touch on the closest cat to the two kids. Yep, that one. Yep. I don't actually know how to do this anymore. Where's my spell-- 18. (heavy breathing) Cool! Ooh! I see this one that's threatening. I'm going to try and get a little more fancy with this. I'm just going to see if I can manifest the power inside the cat. Yeah. Shooting, going for inside the cat. It's already gross. That's right, I've got to learn this. 22. Ooh. Okay. We're good, we got this! There was an old man when we got here before. Yeah, that was pretty cool. He went that way. That way, now. That's come up so many times today! Because Warner Bros is your favored terrain? Sure. I'm going to make a wild guess. I'm going to see if there's a little boxhouse nearby. Where it would be, physically. I'm getting a sneaky suspicion-- Investigation? Nine. Yeah. We're still on the WB lot. Just several miles down the 405 ought to do it. Do you want to say it? You thought it, you might as well say it. We're in the BW. (laughter) I'm going to join you, just rummaging through. 20. No, just 20. Does it feel like some of the buildings might still be there, hidden in this forest structure, or is it just too dense? Don't wander too far. We're going down Hollywood Way. I follow Travis. Oh god. 13. Yeah. That's gremlins. Gremlins won't come into the water. (laughter) That just makes more of them. Better than a chlorinated pool, man It'd be a little green. I'm going to join Marisha on the beach because I hate the water. And it's cold. And this has kind of happened to me before. This whole thing has kind of happened. And, this is true, I'm going to say what I said last time. This is true, and you might know this. Mister Satan dude, we are totally ready to serve you! (laughter) This is literally what I said last time this happened. Oh boy, that's not great. That's why I got out. Eight. I'm going to hold my full action until something happens. Until they start moving within ten feet of me. We could have so hung out. I am not pleased. I am going to start wishing that we had some help with this somehow, and I'm going to start, I suppose, casting Unseen Servant? And I'm going to attempt to create something to catch Travis when he lands. And otherwise, I think I'm just staring at the ground for the moment, because that was a lot that just happened. Thank you for making that as awkward as humanly possible. Yeah. If you try and kill him with a rock, you'll kill him, so just go for it. Died like she lived. I get the sneaking suspicion that we're screwed. I'm feeling a little like this might be the end. I'm not feeling pretty good about this, so-- I'm just going to flick it off, and the one, the little creature on the right-- Yeah. Chill Touch. Just going to crush that fucker as just a fuck-you. Yeah. 15. I probably have to roll for damage on that one because he's not tiny. Where's my d8s? Two. That's two points of necrotic damage. It's just a 1d8, right? Yeah. I'm going to move my Unseen Servant underneath Laura, just in case, to try and pull her to shore if she goes back down. You killed it! In theory, you'd be caught by my Unseen Servant. Oh, that vanished when I died! Oh no. Fuck. "Commander Bettany--" "Commander Bettany! Fenton, he's hurt, bad!" All over the place. "Commander Bettany! Fenton, he's hurt. Bad." Oh no. Oh no. Two. This is still a dream, so I'm going to see if this thing still works. Is the one that Laura attacked still looking dangerous, or is it just looking irritated? Okay. I'm going to go to the one that no one's messed with and just hope that this is still gonna work. That's a 23. I was going for the other one. No, the one in the far corner. Four. Liam, are you okay? And I'm going to run just to the edge of the volume. That's okay. He would've wanted it that way. Wait. Without breaking eye contact with Marisha, I send another tendril at the one that won't stay down. 11. It doesn't match the color of my hair. All right. And I'm going to back off a bit, and I'm gonna also keep looking at those screens to see if they say anything. Plus a d6. Plus a d6. They're always out of health potions by the time I get there. No, that was a-- There is so much that is unpleasant happening in here. I'm gonna free up some people. There's just too much happening. The one that Laura's-- yeah, I'm right there. (sighs) Yeah, yeah. Travis is gonna keep him busy for a second. I'm gonna deal with the one that Laura is-- I'm gonna keep rolling around, just trying to-- I'm gonna run away from that one and try and stab the one up by-- yeah, that one over there. Both. I'm not getting within-- I'm getting further from that-- oh, am I up face-up to that one? Oh, I didn't know I was face-up to that one. I thought I was the guy below. Yeah. I'm gonna shove tentacles in it and hopefully start to wrangle it apart. Yeah, that's not good. Nine. Travis! Help! No! I'll remember this! He'll never break NDA again. It's time for Crafty! I was so marketable. Two down. Yeah, we're too close to clearing this. I'm going to try and circle around this thing and get a better shot at it. The one that's got me stuck here. Yeah, I'm going to circle around him. I am going to tentacle kancho. Kancho. Yeah, we are kancho-ing here. Big purple concho. I'm going to add. 11! It's because Matt's sitting in my chair. Just like real life. I did. I knew it! I knew it. Oh, it's me. I'm going to circle around and try one more time. I think I've been trying to get too fancy with this thing, so I'm going to try to hit it through the ground. Try and line it up and give the slap attack. Yeah, no. I don't have my hair. You've done this to me. The hair is where the power comes from. It's really tough to get an eldritch god to listen to you when you have this haircut. There's a reason it's gone. I'm going to break and run. I run to the green. Sure. Did we reset hit points at the top of this? Okay, cool. Wow, that came out weird. Liam's in the cloud. It's dark? Sam, do you have another resume and picture? You only had one resume? I'm going to play with my crazy powers. I really haven't had a chance to play with my crazy powers. My special purpose. I'm going to try and make a purple glow happen behind the glass. I want to try and see what's behind. I'm going to touch the glass and try and force a psychic light behind it so I can see. A gothy psychic light. Guys! Guys! Guys! Look! I'm going to try and keep enough light, and keep projecting a tiny bit of light in this tunnel. Let's walk. I mean, ten minutes is-- Just a minute more. LIAM AND I'm not available. (laughter) I put my hand on the glass. Please, just try. I think there are so many more adventures to have, and I think there's a better future to be written. For all of us. I always knew I'd die young. It's really uncomfortable. You've been holding onto that Speak and Spell thing for so long. You've been showing that off for so fucking long. That was so amazing.
