Hey! I'm going to actually try a crude medical examination to see if I can-- And yes! This is nice. 19. On the medicine, yeah. After I palpate the region. That's a very deep belly button you have there, my god! No bleeding from the ear? No bleeding from the nose? I'm going to go take a look at the remnants of the brain creature. He got zapped and now he's unconscious. Pizza made it. How do we fix it? There you go. Is she bleeding? Oh! In that case, I'm going to cauterize the wounds. There's more than one way to make someone talk! I'm going to shoot my gun off-- get it nice and hot right at the tip and start cauterizing the wounds. I'm intimidated. Aha ha! 21! Look, we haven't got all day. How do we fix it-- And who do you work for? Can I roll history on that or is that--? All right. A 14 in history wouldn't do anything? She did just help-- Lady Kima. The most awkward throat-slitting I've ever heard of. Wait. Well, she's researching-- It's a pew pew stick. Yes. Terrible taxidermy attempt. Very much. Ampersand. Yeah, we'll all go. Let's wake everybody up, and then we'll get to work-- -- on Grog, and go see what that is. Is all this going at the same time? Magic bukkake. Do this here. It's a wisdom modifier. That's good. Oh my god. And several slaps. Does it seem that there are signs of life? It could just be parts of one. A dragon, goblin drained, brained-- Ah! IRL? I'm sitting at 16. You want Magneto's helmet? What you want is Magneto's helmet. I haven't built Magneto's helmet. That's all we can do. It's difficult to prepare for what we're not prepared for. Sorry. Dwarven corpse. We'll be all right, we'll be all right. Let's go. 12. We have a flying carpet, by the way. That's a thing. Wonderfully detailed. Would it be a nature check to actually think if I never learned about this in school? This would be an intelligence check? It's a stack of pizzas. This is a good plan. It would have to be pretty scary. And then, hey, that works. Or he may send them to kill whoever is creating the illusion. That's a great plan. So we're gonna make them hallucinate-- I'm gonna set up on our side of the bridge, I'm gonna set up the Bad News gun and get ready to train it on whatever might try and come across. Oh yeah. Gonna be great. This is a good plan. This is a good plan. We're fine. All right, I'm taking a shot. I'm not! I'm taking that shot, because I can shoot forever. Oh, for the love of god and all that is holy. Misfire, I gotta-- All right, so I gotta stop and clean. Damn it. I'm cleaning my gun. It's happening very fast. No. Can I clean my gun? They are still across there, aren't they? I wanna take a shot at the-- Hm, that's a 23. Ah, yeah! That don't suck! 20 points of damage. Yes. Yeah. That felt pretty good, too. I'm going to hang on him visually and I'm gonna wait to take another shot until he tries to stand up again. So if he tries to stand up again, I want to shoot him again. That's so much more fun to wait. Technically, he's got cover. And it's funnier to just wait. Taking another shot. He's such an asshole. 15. Man! I'll assist. Never mind! Never mind. Okay. We have an infinite rope! We're gonna lower you down. Oh, all right. Sometimes a lava cave is just a lava cave. They have ranged weapons as well. Let's see if there's anything resembling tracks-- But we can go in the one with lava. There would be no random beasts, though, it's just nothing but plumbing. You can, on the other hand, use-- Oh, cool! Yellow. Whoa. (laughs) (sings) The dex of the panther-- Oh. God. I'd like to roll a save against smugness really quickly. Can I save against smugness? I feel a wave of smugness in here. Ally? Magneto helmet! Yeah! All right! Natural one. Clara. It could be a she.
