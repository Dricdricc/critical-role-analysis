Yeah. Yes. Marvel character. Uh, yoga position. Marvel character? Devil Dinosaur is definitely a Marvel character. Marvel character. Both? Marvel character. Yoga position. Marvel character? Oh, Marvel character. Yoga position. Marvel character. Later. Yoga position. There will be another shameless plug later. You can find it on iTunes, you can find it on Google. Oh! Cupcake down! Matt, Matt! Heder's got one. He's jacking in. I just want to make a point that I've alerted everybody in the government-- everybody reasonable-- where we're going, why we're going, and that there should be people watching the Ziggurat underneath Whitestone 24/7 while we're on this mission. Anything happens, be prepared for anything. We've been throwing it, it's not here. I help shove. Probably not together. No! No! I would have brought you into it. Your voice got really high during that. Profit suits you well. It's also very hard to put an earnest relationship in a coin purse. Hooded ones? Cleared out. So it's a name for when he's ribbing you. Ribbing. I'm just so excited by all the puns that are available. It turns spirits into potions. That's pretty solid. I'm out. Well, as long as I've gone one in there. I'll take two. You can actually use it, though. It might be that thing that I got rid of. Misty Step. Chill and casual. We do this to everybody. It's all right. But yes, we are making fun of you. Would it work on Doty? It'll take more than a day to get there anyway, so this way we'll just save some time and we'll take a day to take a look around. Add that to your survival. I was gonna argue that since he has the Duck Totem, that technically he would have a natural migration sense of what direction he was gonna go. Yeah, just thought I'd put that out there. I feel like his duck sense would be tingling. Always knows where South is. Unnecessary, but worth noting. I think we'll get a little closer. Happy little TPK. Yes. I'm not gonna roll that, 'cause you've been-- I feel like that's yours. It landed on other dice. I'm gonna let it be there, though. Actually, yeah, it's 20. I honestly think they might have trapped it. She talks to non-ducks. It certainly is. Do they obey you, or is it a partnership? Let's not question this. They knew about the others. In a way, yes. Has anybody been through that upper passageway? Well, last time. Who's here now? Had to poke it. There's a door you cannot see, and a bad face sucks your life away. We've got another entrance. Let's see if there's a second entrance. Well, they're going to think we're coming in through here, because they know about this entrance. Maybe they don't know about the other one, so we could maybe be super tricky and take an entrance they don't know about at all. If I were expecting people, I'd expect them through the entrance I take or the cave-in, not a third entrance I don't know about, though. Assuming they don't know about it. Higher. Should we take a group look for the top of the spire? We could just make a tiny hole in the cave-in and become smoke and go inside. Is that not possible? He asked. So that they wouldn't even know that we had cleared it. It would just be relatively untouched. It's either that or camp right in front of the front door after just triggering a spell. That may not be necessary. I'm so proud of you! That was amazing! 65 is like 400 feet. Or the closest wall. Did it hit a wall? 400 feet. I'm going to point out, I've already been looking for a way into the cave-in while you've all been being ridiculous. The minute he suggested that he get it, I didn't want to be a part of that, so I just immediately went in to start testing to see if there was ways we could just meld through the cave-in, or if we actually had to make a hole. I misty-ed out of that the minute that he started working on it. Seeing if I can find ways through. I'm going to start, back to normal, at the very top of the pile, looking to see if I can start scraping through using my sword to make a crevice. I get the distinct impression, perhaps, that you used it up, and probably alerted them that somebody was at that entrance. Yes, I just got back. No, I don't think so. 21. Who's got the best night vision? I'm all right with the notion of getting a little deeper in. What color is the rock? I can't see anything, can I? Never mind. I'll activate my boots. Left? 13. Be quiet. I'll stay with the two of you because I can't see shit and I'll slow you down. If things happen, they're going to light up. It'll be all right. We may need a place to disappear to, so yes. You re-roll. How loud was this Fireball? I'll take two shots at the two that came through. I'm going to curl up to the top and upside-down, take two shots. Yeah, with my big rifle. That's not bad. A 20 and a 27 to hit. Actually, even more than that. There will be more. Can we leave something here? Is there some sort of alarm that we can set? Like a Glyph of Warding. Let's take a long rest and see if we can get two more. Let's start backing up. ASHLEY and Let's leave it at the shift, so if they go up our tunnel, we'll know. Everything fun takes a minute. Oh, never mind! Watch an episode of House of Cards, and by then Glyph of Warding will be done? Let's hop in the mansion. Oh, do tell. Is it more tasteful in here now? Is it more tasteful in the mansion? He can have my room. That will be fine. Do they serve meat for guests, or is it just Scanlan that's barred? Tell her you didn't have any. Do we lose hit points from this meal? I feel like that can wait till morning. We have options. Let's have a nightcap. That may be breakfast. A shallow ghost of a dinner served by shallow ghosts of people. I'm ready for a nightcap, and an end of the evening. To a death in the morning. I come running up. No, now. We're going. Good night. Good night! Now! Now. No more. Good night! Good night! I know. I kind of want to break a few things. You've earned it, fucker. It's only the things that make granola good that make it not vegan. Oh, shit. Yeah, and you add the attack bonus of your great sword, which is right in the center. Oh, natural 20! Another?! What?! What?! Oh my god. He doesn't even understand what just happened. Travis just aged a year. Roll 4d6. Roll four of these. And I think you get to reroll. Yeah, roll those and add two more. Or roll them twice. Yeah, there you go. Four of those. Oh my god! That's a six. All four. I'm just going to sit next to Vex and I think we're just going to stand and let this happen. Yes! That's a nine. Just two. No, plus seven also. You get another shot, don't you? Yeah, attack again. 16? It was beautiful, terrible. I'm not entirely sure. Well, really, he cleaned up after you two finished it all off. He swept up. You and Grog were most of the skeletons, easily. (quietly) I wouldn't worry about it. Yes. (whispering) Yes. I'm a little bit behind them. 28. I'm behind you guys. Yeah, we're letting them go first. That's the end of both of them. It's going to be a cadaver and a fern. I'm working on a quilt. Yeah, they're monsters. I'm going to take their cloaks. I fully support it. Whatever you need to do to feel better, man. I'm curious about a couple things here. We're going to strip the cult members of their culty pants. Angry happy face with a goatee. I'm excited. Yes, you do. Scimitar of Speed. This could go-- (interested noises) Yes. Yes, I think I could do something with this. I've even got a codeword for it! You have to speak a word to make it work. Can I program the word? I've programmed it. Perfect. Everybody roll who's walking. 23. Oh, I can reroll a saving throw. Out of curiosity, is this a magic saving throw? Then I don't even have to use a resolve. 19. We don't have the bonus hit points, either, do we? Okay. I'm going to burn my quick heal. Might as well. Will the magic fade if we get too close to the ziggurat, though? Well. Let's go. They would all be dead right now. We would have taken them all out in one clean kill. Towards and away from the ziggurat, and the ziggurat's 1200 and we're 600. You get to go first. 20. Percy and Scanlan are tied. It's dark. Scanlan, you first. My plan just went up the rainbow. I have sticky feet right now, so I ain't going nowhere. Fuck their shit up! We'll hear a thunk, won't we? I'm going to pull out Bad News. Actually, let's pull out Animus. This will be funnier if I'm walking around that way, which is always a fun thing to say. There's that one guy holding on, right? There's one guy holding on. I'm going to use my gun to make him drop an object of my choosing. And that object is going to be the pyramid. So just remembering how to do this. Roll for an attack. That's 29? Strength saving throw against 20. Okay, is he still alive? I don't suppose I have advantage to hit anything that's pinned to the ceiling. So weird. I'll take it. I hit the wrong thing. There we are. I'll burn another point for advantage and shoot him again. Just with a straight roll. That's 19. Same guy. That's nine points of damage, plus three points of psychic damage. And I'll hit him again. Same thing. Hit him again. This time I'm going to take a bonus for a Hex on him, too, for extra fun. That's 27. So that's not bad. That's 17 points of damage, plus three points of psychic damage and five points of necrotic damage. Yeah, and he's got disadvantage on dexterity checks for now, because that's funny. I'm slowly going to make my way towards the ziggurat, so I'm going to be actually walking up on the wall. So you can put me up on the little creases. Yeah, I'm walking sideways, as gravity's reversed right now. I'll make my way, as far as I can get, towards the sphere. You take less damage. d20. Natural 20! Now roll 4d6. He's so plush, though. It's really nice. Whoa! Does he get to reroll ones? Does he get to reroll a one? Reroll it. Better. The walls are tall enough that you can put that above people and it won't be a problem. You're close, though. You can throw something at it. Dungeons and Dragons. Yeah. No, it's the big motherfucker. The minotaur. It's so nice that this is not a problem. I have advantage because of Cabal. Natural 20. Weren't they on the ceiling? They were my least favorite. 26. Is he on fire, too? God fucking damn it. I'm going to continue further down the wall towards the evil orb of death. Is that as far as I can get? Okay. And the cultist closest to me on the ceiling? That one right there? Let's do some damage with Animus, and let's add a sharpshooter for it, just for fun. That's 16 to hit. Hold on, I may have done that wrong. 17 to hit. That's irritating. All right, forget sharpshooter. One more. That's better. 24 to hit. This is not the one I have the Hex on, right? Okay, that's fine. I should have done that differently. 12 points of damage and one point of psychic damage. He's still fine, isn't he? That's fine. I'm going to hit him again. That's like 35 to hit. Jesus Christ, I rolled a 19. And that's 17 points of damage and one point of psychic damage. I'm going to use my bonus to heal myself a little bit because goddamn it. Oh, Jesus. I'm attacking one of the cultists. I'm up to 120 hit points now. Goddamn it. I wanted to throw some electricity on it and I blanked because my brain is made of Swiss cheese. Is it too late? I'm going to add-- on that last shot, I'm going to add 5d6 worth of electricity damage. (counting) 16 points of lightning damage. That's five Cabal's. (blast) Five Cabal's. Yeah. Really? You always say that. That doesn't mean anything. It's possible we can run straight into the ball. It might be concentration-based, and if he can knock it out... Oh god, there's a lot of d6 I hear rolling. Oh no. Oh god. Can he bounce off at some point and stop pulling through this fucking rainbow of death? You know, I would watch Jeffrey Dahmer's Prismatic Sphere. We still have two cultists full of magic. They're above you. On the roof. It's your everyday Prismatic Spray. It sprays in a cone. It's a sugar cone, not a waffle cone. Is it magical? I rolled 27. I can't help. I can't help. I'm not allowed to help. No! I am going to unload a couple shots into the orb and see what happens. Animus freezes up, I throw it. Pull Bad News. Bad News freezes up. I pull Retort. That hits. Yeah, I'll burn an action surge for this. I'm going to sit and fix my guns. We're going to drag this cadaver outside. Yeah. Resurrected. No. Let's take this outside. Just take it outside. Nothing good happens here. You're just going to waste your attempt in here. Can't we? I don't know. Can't we? What is it? Did he not have one more? Tune in next week for a shopping episode. Critical Role goes to the beach. Doty.
