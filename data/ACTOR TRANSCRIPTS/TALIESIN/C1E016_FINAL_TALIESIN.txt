Oh, so it is. (laughter) I don't want to talk about it. You're such an eagle. Oh my god. On the shiny die. Oh, wow. That's real funny. Actually, can we have a few minutes to discuss this? I knew you had it in you. You need a tattoo. Would you like to speak to his manager? That was close. The Siege of the Metal Champions. Charisma of ten, ladies and gentlemen. Charisma of ten. I'm not-- I haven't been paying attention. We've got a bear. Shaking down the pope. The ladies of the evening really, really do need the money, apparently. That explains so much. Lie to me, Pinocchio. Lie to me. Well. I'm putting down my mask, just in case this is awful. You've been wanting to say that. Yes, go, run. Teacher, teacher, did I have time to finish my book? Yes! No, we walk gently through. Race you for it. You first, or me? Oh, very well. Ladies first. Okay! I could have done it. I could have made that shot. Yes, next room, next room's all mine. Nice! It's still needed. There are Critters in the walls. -- damn walls! I'm not taking off my mask. That's convenient. As long as it's at range. That was my terrible joke and I wish I hadn't. Now I'm embarrassed. I love my new stats. I rolled terribly this time but my stats are good. Is that what we're calling it? Wheatoning? All right. 16. Fancy. Please, be my guest. Okay. There's one spider that's not caught? All right, I'm going to take a couple of shots at it with my Sharpshooter, so let's start with 24 to hit? 24 to hit? And let's do this. My first shot-- That's depressing. Well, I get the bonus, so that's 18 points of damage. That's not too depressing. It's because I'm taking a negative five to hit. And that's-- oh, that's not bad. I have new numbers. 16 to hit. Aha! Same target, with an added fire bonus. Three fire damage and 17 as well. 17 plus three fire damage. And I duck back behind Grog. (laughter) Oh, shit. Oh my god, that hits. Ow! Oh, bugger. 13 points of piercing damage? Constitution saving throw. (blows raspberry) Rolled a one. (groans in pain) I am poisoned, though. It could be worse. There's the one I shot. Yes, the one that burst into flame. (laughs) Well. A little help here, please? Would be nice. I'm at 47. I could just use my-- oh. 18? Thank you. 21. Perception, 21. Wait. I'm furry, but I'm not Trinket. Jesus Christ. (laughs) What does a level two healing potion do, again? Spiderman. (whispers) Quietly. Way more than arrows. Briar. A sickle. Why would you give him ideas like that? Just feed him irony! Yes, yes, go. To repair the room that we broke, anyway. Yeah! 22. 22. Oh no. Oh. 14. I take a-- Oh, dear. I'm fine. That will top me off very nicely. That could've gone worse. We should mention, you may have to have one of the rooms repaired. The spinning column-- May have gotten-- We put an arrow into it. Vord. You'll be back.
