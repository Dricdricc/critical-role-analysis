Oh wow that's everywhere. (laughing) That was a really good Doctor Claw. This will work out way better than that Tamagotchi you owned. Well, that sounds nice. Well, actually. Big Sur is nice this time of year. I heard the whole story between games, I don't really-- you should just know-- That's a very fair point. I definitely want to do that. That sounds great. I don't have any expectations, so, I'm not sure if that's true or not. I'm going to take a moment to look through the sand and rocks and see if there's anything interesting. 15. Investigation? Wait, hold on. Investigation. Never mind, that's a six. Makes sense. You're right, this is spectacular. He looks like a Thaddeus. Why not a both? A one, a two, a three. I'm going to take a minute to try and explain to the Professor what a doctorate is. If he's confused. All right. Oh yeah, I'm going in. Forget this. This smells weird. I really like it. Never before. It's amazing. Oh, man. I can't even imagine. I think we can camp on the beach before we leave town, but if people are anxious to get this done-- It also occurs to me, this is an eastern ocean, isn't it? So it would be a sunrise or a sunset for this ocean? We need an orrery now to figure this out. I'm very excited. Without a doubt. That's really beautiful. That's amazing. Does it do this every night? Wow. That's exactly what I thought, too. How long has it been here for? That's beautiful. I was just thinking, I felt a little underdressed. No one talks to anyone that commits mail fraud. It was on the tip of mine, but that's fair. I may join you in that, if that's all right. I'll also humanize myself and put together something that looks appropriate for the sort of people I've seen walking around. Lot of pearlescent whites and greens. Oh, this'll go poorly. No, I'm not. One foot up and down. Straight intelligence check? 14. Definitely the same pink hair, but tied back. He's a thin, adult human man who's got a little bit of a scruff going into a bit of a shaggy goatee. If this is appropriate for it, a little bit of the French Restoration, but nice, pale, opalescent whites. Oh my god. Okay, yes, that's fair. It's muted, but fun. That's a lot of happiness, and that's okay! Lighten up a bit. I named the seagull in my head, too. Steven. Steven Seagull. Everybody at home gets out their swatch they got. I don't! Ah! Oh. Sure. Aw! No. Very impressive. Oh. No, he did not. Yeah, I pop back up. Less of a cemetery, more of a graveyard. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Only recently, yeah. Aware of it, but just trying to only dip a couple toes in. I don't know what that means. Funny hair? Does she have a name? You mentioned the lighthouse. Would we need anything to enter the lighthouse? Some token of familiarity, or some name that would get us a tour to meet the proper people there? Gale? SAM and All right. Oh, that's right. Sure. Oh my god, your mother knows The Gentleman. That's so cool. Wait, what? This is the perfect time for a game of Pictionary. I'm so excited. Both of you, don't look. I don't understand what's happening. It is amazing what's happening over here. Oh yeah. Yep, there's no getting around it. Does it look like the same person when we look at the two drawings? Okay. Oh no. I don't. Is there a thing? Oh well. I don't understand what that-- That's fine. Let's-- go ahead. No, you might not have been. I don't know. There's a lot of blue people in the world. I assume. Only just now. This is the sort of conversation one should have in person, I suppose. Perhaps he's hiding, which is why he couldn't answer that question. Oh yeah. I'll head to the lighthouse. Survey the territory. Works for me. That's a great idea. Also on the water. It's beautiful. I'll find the door. Are you Gladys? I think we're supposed to talk. My name's Caduceus. Mother sent me. That's not terrible. 12. I am, I am. This is a long and complicated story, I suppose. We've been holding the north against something dark. Something threatens our small temple. Have you ever been to the Blooming Grove before? It's quite all right. This has been the first sign of the Mother I've seen since leaving my home. Her temple is under threat up north. I was waiting for a sign and I think this is the sign. Yes. I'm so sorry, how rude, my friends and I-- it's only fitting. Is there any service that we can provide for you, for your graciousness in allowing us into your lighthouse? I feel that there is wisdom here. Would it be possible to learn more about this place, possibly? Thank you. I'm very excited. What chase? We'll get there. It's an inconvenient moment right now. We're having a moment right now. Exciting. It's beautiful. I'm not even looking at the view, I'm looking at the lighthouse. I'm going to compare it to mine a little bit. I have my own responsibilities to her as well. This place, it's so different. Was it perhaps a gift from the Lawbearer, long ago? It is beautiful. I will admit we have many tasks that weigh upon us that bring us here. I have two favors that I would ask of you, and I understand if they're not possible. Very fair. We have a friend in town in need of a good turn, and this good turn-- we have a friend who's threatened and we're hoping to maybe glean some information. It's my friend's mother. She's having difficulty with somebody. Do you perhaps see the thing beneath the city? I fear that he may be in contact with something inappropriate. With disadvantage. Keep on target. Meta that Sluice, there. Oh, boy. I'm sure we can figure something out. She does good work. I do have my last request, and I'll take these people out of your hair. I'm looking for a sign of where to go next. I'm waiting for the Mother to speak. Is there a place to sit quietly and find her voice? Ah, that's fair. For your trouble. I'm going to pull out one of my teas. It's blessed from the Mother herself, from one of the graves of the less scrupulous families of the north. Good for muscle tension, I find. Grew it myself. You serve the Mother well. It's only fair that you be rewarded. Thank you for your time. She's trying to get in the boob. This is going to end poorly. I thought she was really nice. Did you mean for that to rhyme, or was that just-- It's the first time I got it. That's where you find carpets, I was about to say, yep. We get nine birds! It's nine. I like turtles. It's time for oysters.
