There is a Wednesday Club. We're doing Comics 101, it's going to be our intro to how to read comics! The notion is like the show that you would show your grandmother, or your friend who's never apparently seen a written word next to a picture before. They do exist! I'm sadly not going to be there, but Amy and Matt are going to throw together something really, really awesome, and I'm going to be helping out from the sidelines, throwing them stuff, because I'm going to be out of town. But yay. Yes! I'll be doing my old man voice. It's very fun, yes. I think he's a maybe. Yeah. It was super cool. Mouths are for eating, not for talking. 15. That's looking really crowded over there. I'm going to wander over to that first prison cell and take a look inside that door. Yeah, a lot. 27. Okay. How's my visual on that guy through the window? And I ignore anything other than full cover. I ignore three-quarter cover. All right. I'm going to take my first shot at that lock. Yeah, that's fine. I'll take my first shot with the Pepperbox at that lock. That's 27. Obviously it doesn't take psychic damage. That's 16 points of damage. Cool. I'm going to turn and take my last two shots at Orthax. I've got a plan. I've got an Orthax plan, never mind. I've just given the game away! Oh man! I'm too tired. I'm going to mess up my plan! This is so bad. First shot, I'm going to take the Animus, and I'm going to try for a trick shot, for an arm shot. One for Grit, and just for safety's sake-- no, that's all. That's a 31 to hit. And that's ten, plus eight, plus 1d6 psychic. Plus I'm going to burn eight points of Cabal's Ruin, which empties Cabal's Ruin. So that's going to be 14 points of damage, plus one point of psychic damage, plus-- Five, six. Yeah, I'll take a seven and an eight, I'll give these back to you. (continues counting) 23 points, does that seem right? 23 points of lightning damage. And also he has to do a strength check or drop the axe. He makes that strength check! (laughter) And, just for fun, I'll take one more shot. That's 31 to hit, that hits. Nothing fancy on this one, obviously, just the old-fashioned-- 16 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage. And then I'm going to use the rest of my turn to, if possible, open that door and get behind it for cover, of that room. I just want to use it for cover. He did another thing. I already like it. This is a beautiful glimmer in your eye. I'm excited. If he's prone, does that mean that negates the difficulty to hit through the ring? So that's a mess. Yeah, I think I can see that Vax is having a little bit of a problem. There's a window in the door. I'm going to swing around the other side of that door really quickly. Perch on the wall right over there and I'm going to take a couple shots at Mr. Skelly Skellington. No, I was tempted to see if it was anything-- We've got him on tax evasion. (laughter) I was hoping we would find a person in there, I'll keep digging. Okay so first shot I'm going to burn a Grit for a torso push. Actually, I'm going to add Hex to that, just for fun. I'm going to Hex him. That's 23 to hit. That's 14 points of damage, two points of psychic damage and five points of necrotic. He also has disadvantage on constitution-- checks. And he's pushed ten feet back. I'm going to shoot him two more times. Second shot, I'm going to burn one more Grit and I'm going to try for a head shot. Which will give him disadvantage on next round's attacks. 24 to hit. That's 11 points of normal damage, five points of psychic damage and two points of necrotic-- piercing damage. He has to save against a constitution saving throw. Against 20. He has disadvantage on all of his physical attacks for the next round. One more shot for fun and let's make this a sharpshooter. That was not my wisest thing ever. 16. Oh well. I'm going to flip back around on the other side of that. I'm going to spider crawl all the way on the other side of that door again. I shot him in the face. That happens when I breathe for a second before I shoot. I'm sorry, here's a d8. You've got bonuses and stuff, though. Smear him. All right, I'm going to reload. Because boy, I'm out. LAURA and Yeah, no, that's right! I was, like, what? What? Bubble-- Yeah. (gravelly mumbling) Got a little thing. I didn't know it had a name, and now it's the obvious name for it. It's bubble throat. I'm going to swing back around and back up a little bit, and I'm going to take three more potshots at that bone, because that's what I can see. I'm not going to get close to him. I'm going to back up a bit. Just back up in the middle of the room. I'm going to keep going. Nothing fancy, attack number one that's 26 to hit. And that's nine points of piercing damage, five points of necrotic damage, and two points of psychic damage. Better! And I'm going to see if I can-- Is there anything? I've got two more shots. Oh, I can? Oh, all right, let's do that, that's funny. Another shot at that guy. 23? 23? Oh, and that's right, I don't have that anymore, the Hex isn't until next turn where I can move it. That's 15 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage? Oh! All right. And then I'm going to take another shot. I'm going to make this a sharpshooter, just to end this. Yeah, that'll do. That's 14, 20. 25? I didn't know I had advantage, that's lovely. That's 18, 19, 20, 21. 25 points of damage and four points of psychic damage. I get another Grit back. That is, other than just backing up a little bit more, as far as I can go, just to get out of the-- Getting away from everything! I'm good at a distance. Yeah. Aren't there still two-- That's plenty. If I have a moment, I'm going to look in all those doors really quickly. Okay, then I'm going to wait one second, not to look in those doors. But that happens. And then-- Yeah. We pull it. I threaten it down, and say, run. And owe Orthax your freedom. Run! Okay, can I use Friends to help with that or no, just go for intimidation? Yeah, I'll use Friends to add to that intimidation. So, is that advantage? All right. That's cocked. That's fine anyway. Intimidation is, ugh, eight. I shoot my gun next to it. I feel like I'm losing it. What's in the other room? (laughter) If there's anything interesting? Anything on the body? On the giant? On the pit fiend. Yes, of course. We were running-- let's just say, we had a grudge and we took care of it. Always. No we didn't. Ew. I like Crimson Peak as much as the next person, but this is kind of over it. We're going to be okay. We were expecting this. Then what? It's a big prison. I think you're going to be very far away from us very quickly. I'm going to sit with Doty. I'm going to stay in the room. I'm just going to be sitting on Doty, probably. MATT. Okay. I say, oh no, whatever will we do. We have this enormous piece of equipment that you don't understand and could possibly be very dangerous and probably should be locked up with the rest of us. Oh no. It's actually working better than I expected. It's going to be fine. We're going to be fine. Not yet. Nope. They wouldn't have taken it. Less talking, more doing. It's on the other side of the bars. As long as we're free already-- Am I still chained down, by the way? All right, that's fine. Have we technically had a short rest since we were basically just manacled walking for a while? Okay, just checking. Nope, nope, let's just-- Can we still Plane Shift later? Okay. Stealthy bats. They can see! No, they have both. I mean, biologically, they have both. Yup. Everything's fine. 35. A gate! We can go through. Straight, in the door, keep going straight. Nothing quite like googling '5e bats'. Smells better than the prison. Oh. Yeah! Oh yeah. And we're doubling movement. Okay, yeah. Just the two of us. Attempt to acrobat roll, so that I'm up and rolling? We did a lot. We did well. 30. Are we making noise now? Do we care? Including the two of us, even though we hit one? Good to know. Okay. I'm going to take my six paces towards the lava pit, and then-- -- blood pit, and then I'm going to hold my attack until Vax does what he's going to do. I'm loud. Get in position and then wait. Yeah, I'm useless. I've been holding an action, right? Can I burn that as a dash action? Can I burn my action as a dash? Yeah, I'm burning my action as a dash. I'm going to keep booking. You can't hold movement. We're all human now. Okay, got to fix this super fast. Yeah, we all know. Oh shit, no. No, that's not-- Oh. That might be campaign over. Yeah, that would've been fucking bad. You have a bonus. Stand her up. Yay. Nice! Fuck sound at this point, I suppose. I'm going to run and just get them into view. All right. Three shots, and I'm going to do a pushback on all three and I'm going to push them all-- Spine devil, spine devil, bone devil. Three spine devils and one bone devil? Three spine devils and one bone devil? No Coke, Pepsi. And the bone devil's a real problem, I suppose. Okay, in that case, I'm going to push him back. I'm going to do a shot to push him back. And that's a 19, 29-- That's my power song, you don't even know. 15 points of damage, plus five psychic, and he moves backwards ten feet. Can't get pushed any-- he's still-- All right. Second, I'll take a spine devil, the one that's threatening the most people? 25. That's not the damage. Oh yeah. 17 points of damage and six points of psychic damage. The other one, I'm going to spend a point for Grit for deadeye, just to get advantage. That's cocked. 29? 14 points of damage and one point of psychic? He's still standing? Action surge. Three more shots. Hitting him again. Same thing, with a Grit. Yeah, that's good to do. 24 to hit? That's 11 points of damage and four psychic. Third spine devil. Same thing-- actually, I get my Grit back. Third spine devil. Yeah, actually, I'll reroll the cocked one, but it doesn't matter. Yeah. That hits. Yeah, fuck it. It's worth it, though. 13 points of damage and five psychic. And another shot, same thing, with advantage. That's fine. 24? Thank god they're easy to hit. That's 16 points of damage and four psychic. I'm going to spend my last Grit. Last Grit is a shot to the spine devil. That was one, two-- I'm done. Reload, and that's the end of my turn. Need to heal? Do you have anything to heal with? (laughter) We've got to find out which room he's in. Yeah. 15. Oh my god, yes. Do I get an attack of opportunity since we're moving out of its combat range? Who else wants it? Grog, you want it? So we've got, one, two, three, four. I'll say yes. Yeah. I'm out of its range now. Okay. I'm going to back up a bit. Move me behind that-- and then move me-- the other pillar. Head that way. Does it look like those chains are feeding it? And it has eyeballs. Would a headshot to those eyeballs actually be a thing that might work? I'm going to try it. I'm going to burn a thing and see if that does it. So. Yeah. Let's find out. Right. Yeah, that'll do. 32 to hit. All right. That's a d10 and d6. That's 11 points of damage and three points of psychic damage. And it has to make a constitution saving throw. There's no snapping, breaking the glass? Man, you made me burn a Grit. That sucks. That's okay. I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot at it and just keep damaging it. I'm going to do a sharpshooter shot. That was shot one. Shot two. That's a 25. That's, ooh. 27 points of damage. And five psychic. And another shot, same thing, sharpshooter. Fuck. I never do. (groans) Could be worse. 14. Does 14 hit? Okay. And then I'm going to stay in but keep an eye on everything that's happening. Million. Oh, you have a slight ripple figure. Phantom bear. It's a dex saving throw, and 20 is what we need? I'm going to use a resolve and see if I can make this work. Nope. Same thing. 17. All right. Can we make a chain? You. I'm going to try and break out of this chain. Goddamn it. Strength check or strength save? 14. Can I use an action surge to try and do it again? Yep, I've got one more. (sighs) Nope. Just touch will work. LAURA and You may have to throw the knife. Oh god. Stress. Out, out. Go, go!
