Next game. 7. You had this very vivid look the whole time. Yes? A very long time. If I start it right now.. We don't really need - Well... I suppose that's fair. 24. (whispering) Let them pass. They're taking the path that we're not on, right? So, if we hide-- --They won't find us. I've seen your sheet, you don't speak French. The stealthy mix. Where does the magma runoff lead to? Does it just pour out? Does it fill a moat? If only there were a way to just speed up this exposition somehow. Life isn't like that. Sorry. (all laugh) Do you not know anything? I'm not coming with. Way to take one for the team. That seems fair. That was cold. Oh, for the love of god. Yeah, that happened too. I rolled a 1. What?! Ah! I have a habit. (relieved) Ah! Now you roll well. Yes, I believe it's vision based. Double check. 23. Natural 20. It's entirely visual. They have to catch your gaze and then that is how they can turn you into stone. Otherwise, as long as you don't catch their gaze, you'll be fine. Yes! Very helpful. Let's not give anybody any indication we've been here. How loud is it down there? Is the lava flow making noise? Not like the roaring sound of a waterfall. Does anybody have a "mute" spell of some kind? Yes, as in silence noise. Damn it. Now there's three. I'm going to watch this all go down with Bad News. I'm waiting in case-- This is awesome and nothing is going to go wrong. Such fake geeks. I was waiting for that anyways so, I'm going to-- I hit a 23. Okay, roll damage. I have to reload with my second attack. I've got the big gun out. Oh my god. 7 damage. I'm so embarrassed. They were ready to start shooting at us. That hits. Well, all right then. Like a cat in a tree, just - (beckoning whistle) I'll take one more shot at him. 18? Come on die. That's 25 points of damage. Let's move quickly. Going in the door. It’s the one you don’t suit. Percy was the third child of 7 children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men. As they ran, Percy’s sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (click sound) (gunshot) Ow. I'm fine. We're not here to work. Can we quietly open the door? Kana. Maybe not. Go around the corner and tell us what you see. Take a very quiet peek around the corner. Quietly. It’s a wonder, looking outside. If Mr. Wizard can do it, you can do it. Damn. 12. What does Guidance do? I don't care about them. I'll go with him. In the cells, in the cells. I find a corner of a cell and slowly pull out my gun. I should make sure all the doors are shut, not locked. The bear is at the back cell. So far. 26. Where am I? I'm going to run to the hall. I can do that. 24. Okay, I'm going to try and take a shot and blow the lock. Oh no, Bad News is away. This is just with the handheld, shooting at the lock at the door. Jesus H, 30. 9 points of damage. That ends my turn. Grog is running into Toys R Us. This is going to be great. Spend the entire game being the worst person in the world. At least it's not gamey, it’s fresh. I'm running in. Do I know how to disable the rack? I'm going to undo it. What do I add? Is it proficiency bonus? 12. Please be careful for a moment. Can someone cover her ears for just a second? I'm going to utility shot - I'm going to put my gun against the lock, somewhere where it will not harm her and just blow it. 15. Is it two locks? Okay. 15 for the leg. 10 for the arm. Why don't we collect your things? I would assume they're being stored upstairs. Are there stairs in the room that we're in? Let's go upstairs. Have you dropped the body yet? Are you dragging a dead body around? Government cheese. It's going to be fun! Savage burning-- No no no no! He's been an enormous help. Can I assist? I suppose everybody understands everyone now. Only one of them is demanding that I become a liar. Nice. (swishing SFX)
