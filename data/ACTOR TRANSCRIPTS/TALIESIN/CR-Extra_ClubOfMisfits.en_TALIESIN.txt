Only 70% of the show is mom and pop. He's been giggling about it. Slytherpin. My name's Andy. Everyone knows me, to be fair. I'm a beater for the Slytherpin squidlach team. We're doing very well this year. We might take it all the way to tri-nationals as it's going. I don't care who you people are. Hi, dear. Victory. That's the smell of victory. Smytherpin. I wrote it down wrong. You finished yours? Then you can do mine then. That's great. Here. Get right on that. That would be fine. I've got five quid, which is just enough for me to not kick your ass. All right. Are there locks on the door? Yeah. I'm going to just use some Prestidigitation to see if the door can lock or unlock from here. Yes. So I'm just going to see if there's a locking mechanism. No. I was just going to tell them you did it. Oh wow. 15. Yeah, I do. I mean, it would be irresponsible not to go check and see if someone's in trouble, right? If the room was on fire, we obviously would have to leave. That room could be on fire. Someone's yelling. All right. I dare you to go first. Go check on the door. Get up. Okay, I get up. Now that I see it's not locked, I'll get up too. Shh. Help or don't. I'll-- Yes. I've joined. Are they in detention too? Keep watch. Nerd! We need you to take a look at something. Coming up right now. You ever seen anything like this before? Do you know what these are? Together, no? More deniability? I'm so excited. Oh no, that's terrible. Crickets. Eight. We are sharp, aren't we? That's my armor class. Two attacks, yep. Damn! There's one on me. I'm going to use my bonus action to summon my beater stick. It flies into my hand. I'm going to spin around and try-- I live for this-- I'm going to try and hit the one that took a swing at me and I'm going to strike with a green flame attack. That's my specialty. (triumphant laughter) 27 to hit. That's, oh wow, that's a lot. This is going to hurt. That's a 1d4 and a 1d8. 13 points of damage. I'm going to flip around on top of the desk and squish the one that is on the desk. I am going to swing and squish that one. That's a 16 to hit. That's not going to be quite as hardcore, but it's seven points of damage. Tiny daggers. That hits. Okay. Oh yeah, 22. So three points of-- yeah, okay. 12. I'm going to take another swipe at that one that's not dead yet, on the table that was just mewling at me. I'm going to hit it again with my beater bat. Yeah, that's pretty good. That's 22. That's not too much damage. I just realized I'd done my damage slightly wrong, I've got a plus two bonus. That's all right. That's 12 points of damage. I'm going to run over to you, and I'm going to smack the one that's right in front of you. That's fine, don't be impressed or anything. I'm going to use green flame again. Yep, that hits, that's 26. I'm a monster, I rolled a 19. They're really good, I know. So that's an eight and a four, plus eight. My god, that's nuts. 14 points of damage. On green fire too, so it's flaming goop. I'm going to use my Second Wind to get some hit points back. So that's nine hit points back, and I'm done. You're bloody weird. Aww. No, but I've definitely heard the commotion, so I'm going to at least come running up to the stairs and see what's up. Can I see the sprite? I'll see if I can get in a position where I can see the sprite. Yeah. I see it? I'm going to use-- it's gnawing on a book? Is it gnawing on a book? I'm going to use Catapult spell on one of the books. I'm going to squish it. That's a 14 dex save. That's-- (laughter) That's 17 points of damage. To the book and the sprite. Gross. That's fair. Of course, the centaurs. This was the best one. What are you going to do about it? What about the good drawer? I mean-- Are we doing this, then? I'm going check underneath-- I'm going to check the drawers I can open, see if I can find a key that's hidden-- if she's maybe done the thing where you hide a key where the-- All right. 15? Gross. I'm going to press? Solid! Now I feel bad. It certainly explains a bit. Still no way to open the main drawer, though, is there? That was the main drawer. I've never seen you so awkward in my entire life. I've got an idea. I'm going to find the lock on the cage. I'm going to take one of the tiny daggers from the little, tiny sprites and stick it in there. We got attacked. We heard a ruckus. We came upstairs. I don't like getting caught. I'm going to do one last check for liquor in the teacher's office. No, nine. I give up, head downstairs. Do you want to stay and wait for them to get angry? I know why he knows that. Why do you know that? Blingotts, perhaps. 27. Well... Is everybody feeling all right, by the way? We did just get attacked by a bunch of sprites. You look a little pale. I mean, paler than normal. I'm all right. I would totally back that up. That's great. What's your AC, out of curiosity? How easy to hit are you? Are you nimble? What's your dexterity? Your dexterity's 11. But you're ten? We're going to need this. Report. What is going on? What sort of commotion? Which classroom is this, one more time? There's no potions in here, are there? I'll go downstairs and hit things with sticks until they go away. Eight. Eight. I hate this stairwell. We are still Pass Without A Trace. Natural 20. I don't even know where the kitchens are. 17. I feel responsible for some of this. I'll go fourth. I'm into this. Is this normal? We know. Yes. So you're going first? Excellent. Sure. Carefully. Well... Whoa, that's a big map. You've got an AC of ten, right? Oh for gods' sakes! I'm going to smack you in the back of your head and cast Mage Armor. So everybody's maxed? Also, you're AC is changed. Your new AC is 13 plus your dexterity modifier. 13 plus your dex modifier. You're at 13 now. I'll take the castle. The castle on the end right there. Yeah. We just have the ability to actually kill the other pieces if we so wanted to. Ah! I've got an idea. Second pawn ahead, two spaces. Not that one, that one. Is it going to get into combat with the spider? One space, then. What does that hit exactly, the Tidal Wave? Where did you say you're from? That explains a lot. All right. Fine. Oh yeah, that hits. That was very cocked. That's a 23. What's the range on it? It's so true. Well, I've got one of these coming at me, so I'm going to-- I'm going to do both, but I'm going to attack first, so I'm going to hit this thing with my club. I'm going to use the fire club first. I can do some serious damage. Wow! (counting) That's 18 points of damage to the spider. I'm going to hit him again. That's ten points of damage. How's the spider looking? If I walk away, he's going to take a swing at me, isn't he? I think we should probably move more of the pawns forward. Rook or pawn? SAM and Ten feet per square, approximately. Honey badger don't care. Just some movies to watch, at the very least. Technically, I think how it is, is until we move, they don't move, so as long as we don't move-- So much paper. I feel that. I remember that. Oh my god, that's so rough. We share our numbers, so it doesn't matter. Okay. I'm going to keep wailing on that spider. Hopefully it'll go down at some point. Let's take two attacks-- I'll just start with one attack on that spider. This will be my flame attack. 16 plus seven, that I assume hits. I know, it's crazy. That's 13 points of damage. Half, probably. But if it moves one then the next-- well. If it moves one, then the next attack will be its attack. Might be the end of you yet. Oh, yeah. Probably 28, is my guess. I'm kind of stuck, aren't I? I'm going to try something weird. I'm going to cast Grease on the king and queen. They're the ones that I want. They're the ones that-- Oh, oh, oh. Wait. I'm casting Grease on those two there. They have to make a dex save of 14. She is prone. Also, this is up for a minute, and a creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a dexterity saving throw or fall prone. So if he tries to move, he has to try again. Can't fuck with the king, man. I believe in you. You can hit things. No, probably not. I'm going to run up to that big spider and I'm going to smack him. All right, let's fire up the swing again. 21. All right, I lose my big hit, but that's okay. That's 12 points of damage. I'm going to burn an extra action, so I get another action, which is two more attacks, I believe. I'm going to take two more attacks. That's a miss and 16. Okay, one more hit. That's nine points of damage. I'm whaling on him. This is like the end of It right now. Spell attack modifier. Oh yeah, that definitely hits. That's fine. I have an AC of-- oh no. Yeah, no. That hits. Ugh! 11? I might be out. TRAVIS and I am not out! One. Just one. Tempted to just wait and let it just work itself out. Yeah, I'm just going to saunter over to the spider. Yeah. I'm not even going to break eye contact. I'm just going to swat at it without breaking eye contact. Fine. 19. That's 17 points of damage. Oh, that's not going to go well. I'm fine. I think we're all just really messed up-- I'm pretty fast. Now it becomes Ferris Bueller. 21. Thank god! 25. We have to check to see if your passport has been revoked for that accent.
