Golden Girls. 000150.744 --> 000153.955 TRAVIS, MARISHA, and Contentious. 000156.619 --> 000158.033 It's entertaining. 000526.248 --> 000531.248 This will be you one day. 000532.760 --> 000534.117 I don't even-- 000535.847 --> 000538.153 We succeeded. 000539.277 --> 000547.493 We did. It was nice. We played it more like Minecraft really, like Minecraft with 000552.424 --> 000558.585 snipers. Oh, this is such a nice garden we're-- and it's over. I don't even know what happened. 000558.585 --> 000601.459 We found a bunker. 000602.725 --> 000604.207 I really enjoyed that bunker. 000605.527 --> 000606.147 There was balloons. 000607.162 --> 000611.522 Of course. 001715.882 --> 001722.458 Yeah. 001825.608 --> 001830.988 That's actually a good idea. I'm also going to-- 001836.925 --> 001841.567 Perception checks? 001848.209 --> 001849.226 Also, I'm going to cast Eyes of the Grave. I'm going to do this a couple times. 001852.341 --> 001853.318 Eyes of the Grave! That's perception of 22. 001900.341 --> 001902.260 Oh, with disadvantage. 001903.621 --> 001909.438 Oh, okay, I thought we had put them back up. 001917.438 --> 001919.132 12. 001923.890 --> 001925.081 With Eyes of the Grave. 001926.560 --> 001931.293 Yeah, the sheet of paper you turned in nine months ago. 002022.164 --> 002028.665 I'm perfectly happy to head towards this. 002120.253 --> 002121.366 Quick point of order, who's got the node? We should probably decide now. 002933.718 --> 002935.294 Who was the last to node? Are you noded? 002937.278 --> 002940.414 You node. 002942.662 --> 002943.457 I assume we would have done it. I was just playing flashback, but I don't know. 002950.152 --> 002952.303 That was more of a point of order. 003005.607 --> 003010.566 Do you need a light? 003148.795 --> 003149.462 All right. 003150.171 --> 003158.559 Well, this is a mess. 003908.621 --> 003909.302 I think doing a once-over might not be a bad idea. 003937.612 --> 003940.548 Maybe bring the little octopi with you? 003955.255 --> 003958.503 Oh! Okay, that's a-- 004000.188 --> 004003.224 That's-- okay. 004005.111 --> 004009.616 I think we should probably all stick together, one way or the other. 004012.857 --> 004014.048 I'm going to let the flora and fauna in here know that we're looking for some stuff. One 004048.323 --> 004052.068 of our people used to live here. We'll be gone, and everything's going to be fine. 004052.068 --> 004101.167 How big a creature does it look like was taking a--? 004118.276 --> 004120.359 14. 004127.025 --> 004135.206 Maybe it's time to-- 004256.147 --> 004300.333 Just a little walk around, just to get a sense of the place. 004305.984 --> 004313.870 Hm. No. 004347.659 --> 004356.229 Thank you, Petco! 004741.330 --> 004742.391 Yeah, I don't know if I was quite outside yet. I think Beau and I maybe switch 004814.229 --> 004816.352 places, if that's okay. 004816.352 --> 004818.062 Crickets. 004903.954 --> 004905.404 Four. 004940.886 --> 004943.134 I mean, it means your advantage cancels that out, though, so-- 005431.232 --> 005435.984 Good to know. 005906.737 --> 005911.284 It went great. 010128.095 --> 010129.153 What does Slow give them? 010530.144 --> 010531.687 Am I going to double this up? How are you feeling? 010634.861 --> 010641.229 Pretty good? I'm going to use a bonus action-- I can do two first level spells in a 010646.129 --> 010648.508 round, right? If one's bonus action, one is an action, that's fine? 010648.508 --> 010649.318 Just one or the other? 010650.681 --> 010652.601 Cantrip, there we go. Thank you. I'm going to scoot past you with half of my action, if 010657.911 --> 010703.594 that's okay, and take a look outside to see what's up. How far away-- 010703.594 --> 010706.718 I have five feet no matter what? Okay. Goddamn. There's no getting back in anyway, so 010718.765 --> 010726.207 fuck it. Yeah, there's no sense trying to get back inside. I'm just going to be vulnerable. How far 010726.207 --> 010730.175 away is that one? Is that more than 30 feet away? 010730.175 --> 010731.516 There's no way I can get close enough to get within 30 feet right now, is there? 010735.201 --> 010739.568 You know what? It's not like distance is a problem here. I'll go in an angle and de-clump-- 010746.392 --> 010747.622 yeah, right there. 010747.622 --> 010752.473 I think all three of those are within 30 feet then, at this point. I think that's pretty 010755.480 --> 010757.538 fair. I'm casting Bane on all three of them. 010757.538 --> 010800.469 (oohing) 010800.469 --> 010802.098 That's a charisma save against 16. 010805.171 --> 010808.673 They all take a negative d4 from an attack or saving throws. All three of them. 010829.620 --> 010831.591 It's not a bad 1st-level spell. 010833.733 --> 010841.518 That's everything I can do. 010853.753 --> 010856.887 Wait, take negative d4 to that, too. 011056.650 --> 011057.836 Wait, what? 011114.241 --> 011117.181 Okay. Ah, well. But it's still got Bane. 011119.297 --> 011120.894 You got Baned. 011126.020 --> 011127.449 Bane's pretty cool. 011129.025 --> 011132.098 Hey! Eh. 011209.076 --> 011211.146 You may not be able to get to him. 011358.451 --> 011401.620 With a negative d4. 011513.192 --> 011514.709 Minus four. Or minus a d4. 011621.800 --> 011628.028 Don't you fuck around with me. 011629.486 --> 011635.713 Minus-- well, it doesn't matter because it can still only bring it down to 18, right? 011717.658 --> 011719.489 What? 011720.664 --> 011722.029 No, I'm saying that with the d4, it wouldn't bring that attack down at all, would it, 011725.601 --> 011727.128 enough to be managed? 011727.128 --> 011737.013 Well, I'm canceling the critical, anyway. 011740.016 --> 011744.938 Nope. 011802.726 --> 011811.708 Yeah. 012020.183 --> 012022.814 We don't want them reporting back to people. 012038.725 --> 012041.831 27? 012055.370 --> 012059.969 11 months from now Do you have the rusty key? 012438.456 --> 012442.581 How many people got hurt in that fight, by the way? Three of us, I think, took damage? 012705.668 --> 012707.461 While we're walking, it's going to be about a ten-minute walk? Is it insane to--? 012715.317 --> 012716.428 Yeah, as we're walking, I'm going to start Prayer of Healing, I guess. I know it takes 012722.876 --> 012726.601 about ten minutes, but it's a one-spell heal-all. 012726.601 --> 012728.292 If that's okay. Everybody gets, oh! 17 points back. 012738.845 --> 012739.797 I was waiting for it. 013223.805 --> 013228.288 I mean, I don't think that's-- 013242.344 --> 013243.755 Regardless, I'm blind regardless. 013259.813 --> 013302.866 I can't see so I'll stick with somebody. 013330.129 --> 013331.967 I'll stick with Yasha. 013344.867 --> 013347.022 Yasha and Clay, and everyone else is singling or--? 013413.668 --> 013415.701 I think the notion is that you're not supposed to look directly in it, some sort of 013605.021 --> 013606.203 thing maybe. 013606.203 --> 013607.849 Don't look at whatever the eye or light or thing-- I don't know. 013611.110 --> 013616.296 Thunk. 013821.291 --> 013825.805 Yeah, I don't think that's a-- 014030.320 --> 014032.558 No. 014033.341 --> 014036.205 I think they're going to be nervous that Fjord doesn't speak the language and is moving at 014048.484 --> 014050.802 half-- plus he swims funny. 014050.802 --> 014053.440 Not for a fish person, though. 014056.920 --> 014102.559 I don't have-- 014243.618 --> 014245.343 There you go. 014256.463 --> 014302.660 This is a terrible idea. 014401.577 --> 014402.773 I don't think we should go in this way either. 014426.222 --> 014427.538 I think that's a very reasonable plan. 014620.947 --> 014622.400 One question. This is definitely coral that we are sitting on top of, right? 014738.897 --> 014746.883 It is a protruding large slab of stone and not a big-ass mouth or anything like that, right? 014755.561 --> 014757.699 I'm looking at it. (raspberry) 11. 014807.095 --> 014810.579 It's been a day. 014812.559 --> 014818.369 (exaggerated sighing) I'm putting tinfoil on my windows now, I'm fucking done. 014826.755 --> 014828.451 Yes, DM. I think we send Jester. 014830.905 --> 014833.611 I think maybe we just don't take the coins, maybe. 015044.718 --> 015047.196 The minute I hear things start, I'm going to cast some light on the walls so I can see shit. 015208.357 --> 015213.598 We're in the room? 021539.525 --> 021540.145 I may be blind, other than what I can see, but if I hit Detect Magic, something's going 021547.755 --> 021549.689 to light up in my-- 021549.689 --> 021552.524 All right. I'm just saying, if there was something, I feel like I would know that. 021558.413 --> 021601.922 I'm going to cast Detect Magic? Why'd I put a question mark at the end of that? 021606.589 --> 021609.101 I'm going to cast Detect Magic really quickly. 021611.910 --> 021622.799 The magical aura's coming from the mouth of the cave? 021627.245 --> 021629.913 Oh! It's where the light's being projected from, I imagine. But nothing in the room? 021639.373 --> 021646.594 I would also be able to sense something magic through it that's buried up to three feet down. 021659.326 --> 021700.260 Okay. I'm not getting any other pings in here? 021703.539 --> 021704.666 Just that weird thing up front, nothing else. 021708.162 --> 021719.885 I'm going to ask the kelp Hey guys, this feels a little ominous. You'd let me know if 021808.079 --> 021812.438 there was something untoward happening around here, right? Right? 021812.438 --> 021818.626 Thank you, that is fair. 021822.125 --> 021824.169 I'm proud of you for that. Hopefully that'll be the first good roll you've made tonight. 021908.212 --> 021910.624 To be fair, they don't really talk back, but sometimes they can acknowledge these things. 021917.118 --> 021919.013 Besides, it's polite. 021919.013 --> 021922.369 I literally can't see anything right now. 022047.915 --> 022052.160 Things tend to live. 022054.961 --> 022057.719 I would ask permission before putting a light in the kelp to see if there's anything in there. 022144.525 --> 022148.090 When was the-- yeah, all right. 022204.752 --> 022211.688 Did it trip my Detect Magic sense at all? 022327.246 --> 022328.813 I'm going to do another detect undead really quickly. 022338.067 --> 022341.502 All right. Eyes of The Grave. As an action you know the location of any undead within 022348.334 --> 022352.038 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and isn't protected from divination magic until the 022352.038 --> 022353.898 end of your next turn. 022353.898 --> 022357.385 Six seconds. 022400.658 --> 022409.557 We have undead. 022424.236 --> 022426.327 I don't know, I'm literally blind. I want to light this-- 022451.767 --> 022455.432 Just to start, I'm going to throw some light into the center of the kelp. 022458.488 --> 022505.474 I think this thing is carnivorous. 022553.996 --> 022556.259 Yep. 022557.633 --> 022607.491 I think we should leave. 022613.083 --> 022619.069 Yeah, lights off. 022632.272 --> 022635.015 I've still got a few minutes of Detect Magic, so if anything-- 022658.307 --> 022706.544 I'm going to cast Light really quickly, too. 022934.121 --> 022936.903 Do I even have to bother, or do I know what that is? 023157.513 --> 023200.401 It's something different? 023202.374 --> 023208.378 Oh, then I'm going to do the Eyes of the Grave one more time the minute I see it. There's 023218.887 --> 023221.754 something else down here too. 023221.754 --> 023224.143 You're going to take it? 023233.361 --> 023234.357 Yasha can--? 023238.979 --> 023241.317 Yeah, let's have Yasha-- 023244.419 --> 023245.152 Did you take your 17 earlier also? 023255.080 --> 023255.731 From Prayer of Healing. 023256.814 --> 023258.029 That was for everybody. 023300.413 --> 023301.204 LAURA and Everyone was. 023311.970 --> 023313.461 Did a group thing. 023315.514 --> 023319.847 Yeah. There's something up ahead. 023323.693 --> 023325.579 They know we're here now. 023357.378 --> 023400.350 Yeah. 023612.872 --> 023616.083 Just for fun, I'm going to tap Resistance on you. Well I'm just going to give 023750.944 --> 023754.384 you-- if anything happens in the next minute you can add a d4 to any saving throw. 023754.384 --> 023804.593 I'm going to take a perception check, then. 023832.056 --> 023833.457 That's fair. 023840.095 --> 023843.985 Okay. I'm going to Turn Undead really quickly, and then I'm going to go over and deal 024052.254 --> 024054.158 with you. 024054.158 --> 024056.222 The DC on Turn Undead is-- let me hit my-- 024101.572 --> 024104.402 That's a wisdom saving throw? It's right here so it's-- why is it not saying these things? 024116.174 --> 024118.096 Mine's weird. Wisdom saving throw. Oh, so is that my-- 024122.391 --> 024124.709 Oh. 16. 024126.696 --> 024133.739 Fuck off, ghost. 024135.375 --> 024142.037 Not cool, man.

I mean, would you know? 024303.197 --> 024305.411 Is it worth cutting through some of this stuff? 024334.886 --> 024340.982 I can join you for that. 024342.842 --> 024346.722 Let's find what we're looking for and get out of here. 024412.775 --> 024413.947 Thank you. It's been a long day. 024450.514 --> 024459.381 Damage? 024504.408 --> 024509.364 That's seven radiant damage. 024514.425 --> 024519.942 Yeah, we'll take it. 23. 024651.259 --> 024651.946 Does my Detect Magic-- which I think is just barely still up? I don't feel like this has 024727.802 --> 024729.976 been a ten-minute venture since that. 024729.976 --> 024733.591 It's not much longer, I know. 024735.741 --> 024743.101 No, I'm just coming in and looking around. 024745.840 --> 024749.877 I think it's maybe time for another detect object. I'll take this one. I'm going to 025059.762 --> 025101.339 cast Locate Object. 025101.339 --> 025105.420 On the stone. 025107.235 --> 025111.465 It's by the chair. 025254.190 --> 025256.377 She's right above the throne. 025515.418 --> 025521.255 19! Plus one, so that's 20. 025552.315 --> 025554.081 Oh fuck. 025555.681 --> 025558.551 Fuck.

Entirely up to you. 025937.047 --> 025937.696 I'm going to cast Bless on myself-- 025942.357 --> 025944.896 Bless is concentration. So, I'm casting Bless on myself, on Caleb, and on Fjord. 025951.313 --> 025955.260 Also, I'm going to back up into the wall so I can keep an eye down that. 030009.516 --> 030011.517 Well, no. See that little thing, that little node behind me? 030014.389 --> 030015.707 Yeah, so I can't be attacked from behind, but also I can keep an eye on-- 030018.562 --> 030020.435 As long as there's no seaweed there. 030021.992 --> 030022.878 Oh, then I'm not going against the wall. I'm sorry. 030024.368 --> 030025.939 Then I'm going to take a step or two down to scatter us a little bit more. 030031.083 --> 030032.116 Yeah, I know, it's a little weird. 030034.046 --> 030035.343 Thank you.

We'll make a nice long line so it'll be a little touchy-feely thing to 033548.043 --> 033556.631 get from one side to the other. I'm going to hold my attack until I see her, which is going to be a 033556.631 --> 033558.082 Sacred Flame. 033558.082 --> 033600.466 As a bonus, I'm going to do Healing Word on-- you are probably pretty down, so I will throw 033614.862 --> 033618.583 you a tiny bit-- it's not a lot, but it's nine points. 033618.583 --> 033620.414 That was me. 033633.349 --> 033634.655 And save against dex 16. 033747.540 --> 033749.669 Motherfucker. 033751.065 --> 033752.362 Yeah, all I need. 033754.332 --> 033801.163 You've got a d4 on saves also.

Saves and attacks. 035237.529 --> 035238.474 I am basically holding ready to shoot a bolt at anything that moves, and I was actually 035631.656 --> 035640.898 hanging a little bit far down just in case one of them drops, I can heal, and somewhere where I'm 035640.898 --> 035644.803 not going to get attacked by kelp and I'm keeping very aware. 035644.803 --> 035652.508 I would have made my way a little bit further. 035933.312 --> 035934.705 Puncher of ghosts. 040044.137 --> 040046.251 I can see this happen right? 040142.910 --> 040144.796 Sacred Flame. 040147.389 --> 040149.029 That's ten points of radiant damage. 040156.073 --> 040204.419 I'm staying right at them and I'm looking for any movement while all this is happening. 040252.664 --> 040254.249 23. 040301.719 --> 040302.403 (whispering) This is such a bad idea. 040655.585 --> 040657.028 I am just waiting for something to move. 040817.800 --> 040818.451 I don't like this place. 040853.168 --> 040900.888 Are we out of the cavern now? 040937.496 --> 040940.605 We're going to back out slowly, get out of this cavern.

It's 60 feet around. 041031.522 --> 041037.966 It wouldn't be a pressure thing because we have water in us anyway. 041100.432 --> 041104.258 Let's walk to the ship. 041124.471 --> 041129.762 That's why I made sure to pack some stuff, just in case.

Like that. 041208.144 --> 041214.398
