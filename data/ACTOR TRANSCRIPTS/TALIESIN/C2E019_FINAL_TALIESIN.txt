My face hurts. I get nervous spending too much time in one place, but if everyone's going, then we're going. You're at a table, you're doing well. Eventually, you're going to want to walk away from the table. The table always offers you four times the amount you've ever seen. You got to walk away while you're winning. But all right! Seems a little late for a wager at this point. Fair, I'm in. Shit. Not like it hasn't happened before. Did I notice him casting Haste? Okay. Blood curse of the eyeless. Full strength. The darkest. Galaga. I pull the full Riker hop over the chair. (laughter) And it is out of town. It's almost perfectly out of town. I've always wanted to go to Deadwood. I am feeling greedy. Versus both. Yeah, it does sound like fun. We're already in. I'll get it. Oh, that's up there. Huppers. I can use a little-- yeah. Are you going to be able to heal enough to-- For going down river. Or, well, I suppose it's going to be-- Oh, that's, well-- your hit points. Of course we have the cart and the two horses, yeah. We have the cart, at least. We have horses. Horses for days. We're already ready to leave at a moment's notice. Nine potions, the tenth one's free. I'll take Water-Closet. W.C. North. MARISHA and I was going to say I was hoping to find the same thing. Nope. That was a two with advantage. A two and a one. I've got a torch. For this group, that's pretty good. I'll take third watch. What's your-- your perception's probably high as balls. Yeah, you take it. Should've put money on Beau. Kicking myself for not putting money on Beau. It does actually make me feel better, thank you! You're not there, you can't hear any of this. You're asleep. Although that would be what I would imagine Jester saying. (as Jester) Guys, it's so crazy, you know? (as Taliesin) That was terrible. Insight check. I've been holding out. Nope. Natural one. Has she tasted human flesh? I mean, I'm on one of the horses. Yeah. Oh no. This'll be funny. Come on, first good roll of the day. That'll do. That's a 16. Does it look like happy fire smoke, or bad, unfortunate, something's burning, dark?-- No, we'll do this later. Do you see the smoke over there? (loudly) Everybody, there's smoke over there. We've got to get hold of this right now. There's definitely a plume of smoke. I don't know what it means, I don't know what it's about, it could be a good thing, it could be a bad thing, but we have to stop this conversation right in its tracks. Honestly, I can't tell from here. It's very localized. Is it into the woods, or further along? It's about a mile off the road. It doesn't look like chimney smoke. I'm not sure. Does it look like campfire smoke? There's people, though. Or something. I mean, just be on alert. They could be burning anything. We'll find, once and for all, the answer What do children taste like? They'll be happy to see a cat. I don't think we're even going to pull over. For a bit. I'm following. Great. That seems fair. Selling any wares? Or do you need any news from the other side of the road? There are skirmishes at the border, and soldiers are moving east, lots of them, worth noting. We're trying to avoid it. For sale. Oh, yeah! Yeah, that's still. We have some bits and pieces, what do you need? We have gold, but you don't really strike me as the type who cares. I've got a few bits. What do you need? Do you need tools? I'm going to pull out-- Do we have anything? Fresh produce we're a little thin on because we're just on the road, but we do have-- That's a nice piece of hide armor. That's very nice. How about 16 gold pieces and you throw in a little bit of meat? Perfect. Ten. I pay the man. Pleasure doing business with you. Be careful. There's soldiers running around all over the place right now. Have a lovely day. I've met weirder. And meat. There was a trapdoor in the floor and there were just people stuck underneath there, wasn't there? Three more points on that perception roll and I'd have been like "That carpet looks like it's been moved recently." It's all right. I think I've met weirder people. What kind of armor is it out of? It's hide armor? All right. We made a friend. Yes. He's very dead. And then he rose up from the grave again and we had to kill him again. Twice. Same man. I'm thinking of planting soybeans. That'll do. What kind of meat is this, out of curiosity? Nope. It's just going today. As far as I know, it could be veggie. If only I had help counting to the number four! I think I'm going to want more of this. I'm not sure where it's coming from, but I definitely think-- I'm getting a taste for it. There's trees. Yeah, I'll take first watch. Unless someone objects. All right, that'll do. Do you want to or-- What's your-- I'll take it. But I have night vision? 12. I'm so glad to be out of that bloody city. It's nice to be on the road again. I've never been up this way before. Not that I can remember. Not that I know. You haven't done that before. Well, she's going to be gone for another six days now. That's lovely. 16. I had 16. Do you roll a save against poison, or no? I'm going to run directly at the creature right there. On the way, I'm going to use my bonus action to start one of my scimitars. I think I get two attacks with that scimitar, then. Yeah. Setting my new max HP. All right! Attack number one is 16 to hit? Just double checking, I'm still at a d4 for-- All right. That's (counting) 11 points of damage. Do I still have movement? I'm going to head around the tree for the other one that-- I'm going to take one shot at him. Ugh. Ten. All right. I know. AC is 15. What's the effect of the toxin or venom again? I'm going to get the one in front of me. First attack, that's all right. That's 19 to hit. That's eight points of damage. One more. 19 to hit. That's nine points of damage. I'm going to turn around to the one that's behind me. I'm going to take a third hit. 12. Total of 12. That's everything. Well, I could move, but no. I'm going to stay locked with this one then. No, I'm done. I'm going to use-- disadvantage. You're welcome. Isn't it still slowed? Oh, it's two. Okay. Oh, that's cool. Welcome to the world of tanking. The other ogre. I'm going to take a-- That's 19. That's five points of damage. I'm going to run towards the horses, where they came off to the left, and as I pass that wolf, I'm going to take a couple swipes at it. That's an 18 and a 17 roll. Let's just see what that does, before I see if I even take a third shot. That's (counting) 18 points of damage. I'm going to keep heading towards the cart to see if that goblin is still there. Well, yeah, and I'm heading my way because I saw that one run off to the-- With a Vicious Mockery, too. Might as well. Go scrape that up off the ground. I was already on my way there. It tastes like wolf and ogre. That's fair. At this point, am I back with all of the gold and all of the sacks? Well, I'm sleeping underneath the cart. I'm picking up all the stuff. This has been very enlightening. There is probably going to be lightning. Anyone else who wants to join me? We'll snuggle. I'm going to make a little camp underneath the cart. Join me under the cart? A band of--
