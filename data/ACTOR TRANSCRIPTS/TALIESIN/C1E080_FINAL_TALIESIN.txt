People, US Weekly. - That was a good shout out. High school Spanish is the official language of Los Angeles, well done. It'll be insulted. Actually, yeah, it'll actually Google translate and will be like, I refuse to even touch this. ♪ Do you believe in life after-- ♪♪ (growling, screaming) ♪ (electricity crackling) ♪ No, stop, don't. - I am throwing on my mask and I am running into the room. I'm actually gonna be spider crawling. I'm gonna be on the-- on the walls so that I'm-- yeah. I don't want to be in the line of anything that happens.Running. This ain't Dr. Strange, this is-- Out of fluid, you know. I know, I got to make-- I got to make Spider-- Spider Percy. Okay. How do I pee? No. Yay. First roll of 2017. - Yay. Just shunned her into invisibility. Like a ghostbuster. She's looking for disturbances of the force. Roll a 29. Wow, it's weirdly mirrored. Okay, that took me a second. - Yeah! Yeah, I know, cool. - We have the same view you do. So, we can say like, "move us down," and they'll be towards him now. Yeah. - South. - There. - Where are our pointers? We need new pointers. I'm taking Diva. Get on up. We'll find out. Three weeks, man. It's like riding a bike with pen and paper. Farting dragon. Invisible farting dragon. That should give you a Dragon Slayer bonus also. No. We can raise them by setting them on fire. I have a brilliant solution for this for next time. We can Battleship it. Next time, next time, we'll just have a row of letters and a row of numbers. -Says move me up to L7. - Isn't that a great idea? That was amazing. It's either that or lick them. What am I gonna do with all these eggs? That Seagulls song is so great. One of the best things they've done in a long while. I don't like any of this. I'm running my way in there. Okay. That'll do. - I don't really have-- Mostly I just want to use my bonus action to take in everything and look around and have a-- have a good, good serious look. In fact, I'll even take a perception roll if I can have one. - Okay. Let's get-- okay, no never mind. That's pretty good. Wow, it has been a while. -Twenty-five. - I love Hannibal too, it's great. Okay. Eggs, dust. Can you put me, like, on the wall just cause I don't think I'd be-- I was still spider crawling so even on top of the little wall thing, if you want. Thank you. - That makes me happy. Cool, cool. That's a number. I hate all of this. Oh, good, I was worried about her legendary actions. ♪ I don't know what that means. I don't know the meaning of the word. I'm wearing my mask. I don't know if it actually helps, but there we are. My save versus magic would not help with this at all. Cabal's Ruin would not help with this. Okay, just check. You're punching a dragon fetus right now. That's like so eggs benedict. If they're clones, maybe it's literally five new breeds of dragon. What do you call the little chocolate eggs? This is the like the Westworld version of killing a dragon. Benedict. ¿Donde está la biblioteca? We don't actually know what's been done. She doesn't really need it. I can't see the die, I'm gonna assume it was an natural 20. It's okay, she burned a counterspell. You'll shit? - Gerd jerb. Alright, I'm gonna use Animus and I'm gonna take some potshots at that egg that's on the other side of Grog. - Yeah. Is that one of the dead one or is that the-- That you just punched through? Okay, in that case, I'm gonna keep-- I'm gonna actually start walking along the wall. This way as far as I can go. Yeah. And I know, like, I'm too close to shoot at that egg, but I can shoot at-- Technically, I am far away enough from it that I shouldn't-- Further like-- like this direction. I want to head this way. Okay, and I'm too close to the egg to get a clean shot at it right now, right? - I've got some height, so. I'm using a one-handed, so. I'm gonna fire with Animus. I'm gonna take three pot shots at it with Sharpshooter. Shot number one. Yay, that could have been terrible. -26. - Should I just roll all three and then do damage? - Okay. 26, um, 14. That's fine. - And 16. Okay, I'm firing really terribly, but that's okay. Hanging off a wall, this is new. Let me get my dice. That's alright. Twenty-three points of damage plus four psychic damage. Alright, that's my-- Yeah, I'm just gonna use my bonus to reload and take some more shots. Goddammit. That's better. Fifteen. - Thankfully my spider sense tingled. - Now I'm gonna fall. Okay, what is this? We're-- we're all-- We're all just gonna turn inside out and that'll be the end. It's gonna be like John Carpenter's The Thing. And then get separated out into equal piles. ♪ Constitution ♪ ♪ Come on ♪♪ - Nice. Previously, in a previous battle. - Fire giant. How do I remember this? That's horrifying. At the battle at the-- - Backhanding it, no less. - Oh, don't do that then. You left the gas on. You rolled well. Does she have to make a concentration save? - To remain invisible? So, we have two ruined eggs at this point. Might be just deep in there and flattened. Could have just been a bad egg. Like five of them in here. Do something about this. Get on up. It's like a Terry Gilliam movie. I'm not gonna play that game, man. Not playing. I'm not playing this game no more. It's not the time. It's a start. She made her saving throw. Not anymore. She's now at-- - What does the level one Healing Word do? So, she's at 12 hit points now. - That's better. - That's-- He's not gonna do it until Ashley's dead. It's Amazon Prime. It's gonna take three days but it's gonna be here. Yeah. She can almost drink. - Okay, I'm going to... Yeah, this is fine. I'm going to-- this is fine. I'm going to take some shots with Animus at that awful bastard at the top of the cave. First shot, and I'm not making it a sharpshooter shot, I'm just shooting. That's good too. Oh, that's not bad, 24. Alright. That's 13 points plus five points of psychic damage. And another shot. And that's, uh, that's-- Oh, that's not bad. That's two points of psychic damage to me. So that's 54. So, that was like thankfully, just an ow! I'm just putting it away. I'm just gonna try and pull-- pull out the big gun and take one last shot while I'm-- while I'm-- well, actually, no, that knocks out my attacks, doesn't it? Cause it's a psychic damage. I don't have time to switch guns. No, cause the psychic damage knocks that out if I recall. So, do I have time to just try and get one more potshot out or am I-- It was fine, it was working fine. - Yeah. Nothing's broke, well, now... Now that's broken, okay. So, and now Bad News, here we go. Natural 20! - Thank you, baby. Okay. Yeah, let's-- let's take-- Let's take-- I don't do any weird critical thing other than doing a lot of damage. Although, where's my-- I do have, okay, so-- That does a lot of damage. (talking over each other) - Double dice. Not bad, okay, that's-- 31 points of damage. - That'll do. Yeah, it's 4d12, plus six, so. And now I'm gonna hide behind that dragon egg. Yep. Oh, and that means I get a grit point back ah-ha! I can actually do a thing, that's good. Okay, alrighty. The Earth itself turns against us. (rumbles) There's nothing natural about 25. Purely artificial, you've had work done on that 20. - This is LA. Man. She's still alive. I'll go with that. Pike. - No. No. In defense, she had some corn stuck in her-- I'm trying not to say anything. He just went unconscious. Something's gotta be done about that. Magma is practically like your arch nemesis to be fair. You can't heal as a bonus action, can you? On the armor. I got that extension so bad. I don't got to pretend I'm (indistinct). Please, please! Please kill it! God, I can't breathe. It's the angriest Captain Planet-- it's just the worst-- Chromatic spray. Yes, but they're all bad. -It's a wheel of death. - Of just-- just goop. It's a great way of dealing with people who are-- who are attuned to deal with you. (indistinct talking) It's really good. -It's very you too. - No, a month from now he's gonna show up. Your dragon-based humor is way too tight right now. You got like valley girl on that. "Who took the triangle?" I don't know why you're looking over here for that. Or what if the eggs are helping her? I don't know, I just like putting things out there. We're making some bad groupings there, by the way, people. You relieve yourself gently. I cast Tinkle. We can make eggs benedict. We have the makings for eggs benedict. Yeah, that got eaten. Yeah. -Get it. - I may make one for the table. 22? - It was a beautiful tree. - You've been drinking, brass dragon. Have you been working out? You look like you've been working out. Swipe right, swipe right! Fishing wire, we can just string it from the top of the set. ♪ J'Mon ♪♪ Raise your hand if you would-- you would like to be-- I don't think she can. Nine is good. Technically, it's 9 times 6, so you did a lot of healing. Nine times six is a lot. That brings me up into the 60's. Fifties. Cast of thousands it takes to play Ashley. It's the level two Mike Tyson's punch out. I knew that would break you. Okay, I don't have it marked down that I burned my action surge, but I think I burned my action surge. But I still do have two points of Cabal's Ruin. -If I recall. - Okay, just making sure. Alright, so, I'm going to-- from my little vantage point, take a shot with Bad News. See how this goes, and I'm gonna burn a Grit for advantage. Let's do this. ♪ Yeah. I mean, that wasn't fine, but we could do better. Yeah, that's already better. Thirty points to-- 30 to hit. Alright. Let's use these, they're sparkly. Two 12 plus six plus, I'm gonna throw 2d6 worth of electric. 2d4 worth of electric. Learning how to use-- Oh, 1d6, no, never mind, here we go. So, let's add. Empty out Cabal's Ruin. That's awful. ♪ 10 points of damage plus 6 points of lightning damage. For me. - Nice, I have one more shot. So, I'm gonna take my last shot although there's no more electricity. That's probably not gonna hit. That's 18 to hit, that does not hit. - That does not hit. But at least it doesn't backfire. I'm gonna start running. I know you don't have the little plastic thing, but I'm feeling a little clumped over there, so I'm gonna start running up the wall at an angle, so probably three up and three-- three up and three side. It's like watching some very, like, complicated... Oh, yeah, medicine won't heal it. Care Bear stare! She's gonna throw it at us. She could go all Donkey Kong on us. Wow. That's not happy. Such a pretty die. I didn't have to roll. I'm just mocking him. - (laughing) Gilmore makes his save roll with a 19 plus three. Can you arc lightning? It's a football helmet. Full of balloons. There's cake and ice cream upstairs. You need to heal the living hell out of these people. Which means she obviously can't do claw attacks. Can you heal? The twins, they're both unconscious. With one death saving throw already failed. We're at that point. This is dungeon and dragons. Do you need some d8's? Oh, wait, wait, wait. It's back up. I think, I think maybe they're-- No, no, I think she may be on to something. No, no. Can Gilmore dispel or-- Just throwing that out there. I know you're playing a lot of hands here. Goddammit, okay. I'm trying. Goddammit. We need to fix that. Please, we got to fix that. Well, not anymore. We're down four. - I have nothing. No, cold. No, never acid. You are the worst person. Two seconds longer. - Oh, yay. Wow, look at all those minis that are flattened. Wake up our healer. Five down, we have five down. We're so fucked. Yeah. - Is there anything you can do to fix this? - Fuck. That-- yeah. And she still has her turn coming up. Oh, okay, okay, that's good. And then she can burn a fourth to heal somebody at a fourth level. She can heal you at a fourth level because you need healing now. Goddammit. - Yep, this could be it. - This is it. Oh God fucking damn it. Okay. - Goddammit. Book? Oh, under a minute. Oh, well, she can make her way-- Yeah, like. Oh my God. Less than six seconds. I'm almost of the thinking that she shouldn't take it just because-- -Well, no, she's got-- - Well, I mean, but anything hits her-- half the things that hit her are gonna even kill that and that's a revive from death. Yeah, you do it, you do it, you do it. I'm overthinking this. You. It's Scanlan, Scanlan's on the ground still. He hasn't said the phrase. - Thank God. I'm taking... You know, I was gonna take shots at the eggs, but I give up. I'm taking just shots at Raishan. Come on. Don't be stupid. -That's stupid. - Yeah, so I've got-- that's a-- that's a-- -That's a gun jam. - Yeah. - Hold on. That's a bad gun jam. I'm talking bad, they're both bad gun jams. Alright, I've got one weapon left that can just barely make it, so I'm just screaming to the world. Here we go. Yeah, Retort is out and that's a 23. Only one more because I took an attack with Bad News. But-- no, the first shot went-- Right, so I have two more-- I have two attacks with Retort. -So, that's-- - That's um, oh, that's nice. Fourteen points of damage. And... Oh, that was so mean, that was almost a natural 20. -Twenty-four. - Ah, 16 points of damage. - And I'm going to reload, and I'm going to start running across the wall away from the fray. Yeah. That far. Getting out of the way. God fucking damn it. Yep. That's where we're at. I--I have no-- there's no-- That may happen. You have a plan? - Okay. (whimpering) Yes, it's really bad. ♪ And she's so much faster than him. She's hasted. Yeah. He can only go probably half her speed. Who's got healing spells? Wake up whoever can heal. So, get her up. Fuck. Six zero. - You died as you lived. Oh, look, someone left a metaphor on the ground. (laughter) Don't step in it or anything. Oh God, it's everywhere. - Well, this could've gone worse. Yeah! There's a lot of work that needs to happen. Who's up? I mean, who's next? Don't worry about it. Let's get out there. I'm gonna try something weird. Pike's up. And that's-- that's Pike's problem. Alright, that's an option. Let me know, I've got maybe a plan. Yeah, you've got that. That's an option, I've got another plan. You know my plan, my plan kind of sucks, but. No, no, it should just start. - Oh, there is a button. I say, well, maybe killing the eggs, I don't know. Kill the eggs. We got a minute. Got a minute. The caps are what make it worthwhile. No. Well, it's not-- we're still-- Yeah. Yeah, there's that. This is a plan. Has my turn not come up yet? Oh, I want to try something stupid. I want to try and run headlong at the barrier. I want to stay on the wall. Yeah, and I'm up on the wall still. God, fucking damn it! This poor book has seen better days. Hold you up so you don't fall. We don't know where they go. That's fair, although I will say, before we leave, we should probably make sure all those eggs are down -before we leave anyway. - Hit an egg. - Multi-pass. You solved it! One of the two. You can hop in the egg. It's basically a hot tub. I love that movie. Hello. Somewhere in the world, there's a whole chatroom of people yelling at you telling you-- There's always-- everybody needs healing. - It's all good. No, it's not, I know, but like, it's looking better. And worst case scenario, we're stuck in here for another round. And you didn't even burn a spell yet. It may just be that it's down now, but it may be the dragon guts. Alright! No, too late. Got to finish this off. Avengers, it's clobbering time. She may have taken him somewhere. Teleport. I can't believe we all lived. That should not have happened. Everybody. - So it would have been almost everybody. It is. The other plane of dimension is like literally the Beetlejuice, like send you to the sandworms. You're just-- And that's-- you're out of the fight until they can go find you if anyone's left. After everyone else has taken 10d-- suck. Red eggs and ham? I just want the internet to do a Dr. Seuss red eggs and-- I just want her with like a little red steak and two little red-- That's all I want. Highlights. Yay.
