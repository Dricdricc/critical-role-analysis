You can do a limerick. It'll be exciting. What do you need, what do you need? Pathfinder! I've made an extra copy of your character. BAFTA nominee Ashly Burch. Oh god, I'm going to die. What does it say at the bottom there? You're not supposed to just come out and say it. When we last left off, we were in a cardboard box. Frost Wilfred Brimley Stab the other person, not yourself. 26. I think you notice things and have an epiphany at that point. Rolling stealth plus ten. 26. You don't know where you are anymore at that point. Let's pace and slowly approach. That's fair. You have knives. You could cut your way through the back of the tent. Make the door, make the door at the back of the camp. And that way, we can run them out the back of the tents. Make the door first. All right I'm going to go, actually, right over here. I'm going to hide over here and I'm going to try and get a bead on the guy on the tree. Waiting for the distraction. Just do it! (sings) Five gold rings! This is the most Douglas Adams beginning of a fight ever. Oh, hell yes. If you'd conjured a will-o'-wisp, it would have been you in that hole. 24. Amazingly, I've got a bead on that guy who's trying to let the bears out of their chains. I'm going to take Bad News and I'm going to sit and take a nice calm breath, and I'm going to squeeze off a shot and knock him on his ass, so this is a trick shot, leg hit. Wait, before I do anything, I still can use Hex because the last creature to have Hex on them died, so I can use it as a bonus action to cast Hex again, can't I? Couple hours, I believe. Might have been too long. Oh, fuck it. And it's a full day's rest? It's a long rest. That's fine! Taking that shot. No, not Sharpshooter. That's 24 to hit. He has a strength saving throw? Yeah, no, he's prone. He also takes 15 points of piercing damage. Cool. All right. I'm going to move to my right six spaces and I'm going to take another shot at the guy who's right ahead of us, in front of the pit. Yeah, right there. I'm going to take a Sharpshooter shot. Yep. Whoa, that's nice. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. 27. That hits. That's ridiculous. Yeah. I rolled an 18. So that's a better roll? A better roll. That was a pretty good roll. 16, 17, 17, 27-- 33 points of damage. I put down the gun and I breathe. I figured I would be part of the distraction. I thought we had taken a short rest, just not a long rest. Yeah. 'Cause we stopped and we healed. That dryad can help kill him now. He's prone, though, can he do that? Can I do a Gloves of Missile Snaring? Yeah, so that's 24 to hit? It's actually-- I can reduce damage, I can't change whether or not it hit. Eight? Eight points of piercing damage? Okay, so I'm going to try and catch it. And yeah, I reduce the damage to zero and I actually can catch it in midair. Stab it into the ground. Can I use it again or no? What did they roll to hit, though? A natural 20, so it hits no matter what. I took eight points of damage? Can I get some closed-mouth ones? Okay, now breathier. Cats with a catnip toy. Okay, I'm going to grab the javelin really quick. I'm going to walk over to the guy who's just starting to crawl out of the pit. I'm going to look him in the eye. Javelin goes right in the face. I'm using it as a stabbing weapon. I'm not letting go until he drops. That's fine. It wasn't about the strength! Strength bonus plus five? One. Plus six? Six, seven, eight, nine, 11. Throw it away, pull out the gun and shoot. (laughter) First shot to the face. That's still better. 17 to hit? Okay. That's 15 points of piercing damage. I'm going to look up to see if anybody has noticed that this has happened. All right, I'm going to pick one of them and take another shot. The one on the left, I'm going to take a-- yeah, let's do a sharpshooter shot on him. Yeah, our left. Yeah, that'll hit. 26. That's 17 points of damage. Yeah. Can't even hit a bear. Yeah, it's a very paladin thing. I'm hidden by Keyleth. (uncannily good crow noises) I've been paid good money for that. I can emote as a bird. My turn. Look at that, is there only one guy standing now? Okay, I'll look at that guy who's right in front of me-- I'm going to take a push shot, I haven't tried a push shot before, I'm going to do a push shot on that guy in front of me. That's 29. All right, that's 13 points of damage and he pushes directly away from me ten feet. Yep. That's good. And then, let's see, the bear is a still a problem, isn't he? I'll sneak another shot at the bear. This is going to be a sharpshooter and a trick shot, I can't take both at the same time, can I, it's one or the other? And trick shot. I'm going to sharpshooter and trick shot. And that's 23? Not that hard to hit? Has to take a constitution saving throw. No, he has disadvantage on attacks until the end of his next turn. Yep. Yeah. 25 points of damage. I'm going to burn through my action surge really quickly and reload and take two more shots. Two more sharpshooter shots, nothing fancy. The bear. 23. That's 20 points of damage. So I have one last shot. Can I spend a grit to try and shoot the rope that's holding that guy in the tree? Disadvantage. Grit or no grit? I can actually technically get advantage on the shot. Yeah, so I'll spend a grit point on that. Natural 20. Can't even kill a kitten with that. No, it was a one in 20 shot. I'm cool. I assume the one that isn't on fire, but you know, that's my opinion. No. Yeah. Cool. Oh boy. So your strength saving throw goes up by one. Two orcs, what did we, two-- Two dryads, two orcs. Let's eat the food that won't last and return, cook the boar and return. We can also bring the food into the mansion and let the help cook it. We're not going to the mountaintop. (unnervingly realistic crow noises) (unnervingly realistic crow noises) (realistic crow sounds) I don't think a crow has darkvision. They're not owls. (owl sounds) You're just turning your head 180 degrees back and forth, aren't you? I'm going to spend a little time tinkering before I sleep, working on the broom. I've tried this experiment in real life. It never ends well. (laughter) I've never been so happy. All right. Let's send our friends on their way and make our way to the cavern that you found. Well, they were fine rolling around, we already sent the wounded and the young to Whitestone, they're fine. It's warm in your ear. We do know that Gilmore's Glorious Goods shirts will be shipping out next week. Gilmore's Glorious Goods shirt, the preorder shirt will be shipping out next week. We'll be using this time to ignore what's happening over here while the Gilmore's Glorious Goods shirts ship out next week. 50th episode. Not anniversary. Frost-vield. What is wrong with-- Frost-vield. Jif. God damn it, you beat me to it. That's why I'm in the back. Can I take a look at it? Celestial? Well, there you go. I had not a lot of friends growing up, this was a lot of quiet time. Yes, I read it out loud. Good, oh! Pull Grog. I follow. I'll go behind them. Oh dear. Dagger again? There's four lion heads in the room. It might. Vax, double-check the gold floor, I'm not-- The lion heads. Do they have open mouths or closed mouths? I'm going to take some of the water from the pool, and I'm going to bring it to one of the columns and dash it on the column and see what happens. On the, yeah, the water column. Really? Really? We had to bring it there? Really? Okay. Climbing, climbing the rope, climbing the rope. I'll go up next. Athletics or acrobatics? 19. I'm going to Batman. 23. 13. 17. Ooh, he's got paper. Well, if no one else is going to, I think it'll be funny. Well, why don't I open the door and look in? Both of them. I see a door that I have conquered. (laughter) This thread is silk, isn't it? It's actual material. I'm not going to touch it. Conscious of the creation of air currents, I'm going to gingerly put on my mask so that my breath does not move things, and examine. I rolled a two. So my investigation is five. Which is how old I'm turning. (laughter) It's very mini-golf. I'll take the right. I have my gun in my hand, by the way. And my mask on. I'm going to continue not disturbing the air as best I can. Okay, that just happened. I'm back, baby. 30. Very, I, yes? Maybe? I don't know? I hate you. I'm going to pull back to the water pit to my right. Oh, to my left, sorry. I'm going to pull back to that water pit. I'm going to examine it. 21. Okay. I'm going to scoop some of the water with my mask, pull the mask off, scoop water, and try and toss it at the flame that's right next to me. That's my move. Fascinating. All right. That's my move. Damn, I'm back. 26. Oh shit. So there's a whirlwind in the center of the room, there's two piles of rocks, there's two vats of water, there's two torches, and then there's two spiderwebs. And the spiderwebs are covering the walls. Do you have your earpiece in, by the way? Okay. Good to know. Working on it! 19. (laughs) You picked the wrong day to stop sniffing glue. You made a bad call. Text Ashley. Oh god. Oh my god. The first thing I'm going to is, I'm going to guess a name, because that's fun. I'm going to yell, Lux! Whatever that would be in Celestial. First light. That's fine, I'm going to take a slash at that spider with my sword. That's 19. I don't suppose that there's a keyword dragon in there anywhere? I don't suppose there's a keyword dragon anywhere in that spider's description, but-- Pissing in the wind. It is a magical sword I'm attacking with. That's 11 points of slashing damage. With my sword out, I'm going to run down the hall and I'm going to take two more slashing attacks at the web. 17, but really, how hard is it to hit a web? That's 13 points of damage. 19. Ooh. 15 points of damage. Is there anything written on the wall? 19. Fucking brain! Knowledge is power. For reals! Water and sky. I say out loud, windows and doors! Water and sky! And that's-- Oh my god. His name is the Doctor. (laughter) Doctor whom. That's always bothered me. Doctor whom. Liar! 18. I hate time travel so much. There was a time jump so the glare never happened. Don't do that. That's weird. Stop that. God, every time you're off camera. It'll be fine. I have theories. I have lots and lots of theories. I have lots of theories. There's lots of theories here, we have to be fast enough to try them out. I can only move so fast through the room. Who's that? That's Ashley? I'm going to yell at Pike, first thing. Look into the wind, look into the typhoon, tell me what you see! I'm going to run to the little stone pile, and out of idle curiosity, I'm going to try to shove a bunch of stuff away to see if there's anything in there, look at the stones or anything. Okay. I'm going to take a handful, I'm going to grab a bunch of that and-- I put on my mask and I shove my head in. I pull out my head and I yell, J-I. I burned a whole turn doing that, didn't I? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You're my hero. This is why I'm the smart one. Arsehole. It's going to be so fleek. Streets ahead. Should've had a breakfast! Oh. It's always the right move. You did this to yourself. 18. 19. Bugger all, I got to fix this shit. Oh, what a clusterfuck. Great. Okay. Where is-- can you point to Vex in that? I'm going to turn around the corner. Grog, say the bloody words! Okay. All right, all right, all right. What the fuck am I going to do? I am going to hold my turn right here. Until such time as someone says the fucking letters that we need, and I'm going to be ready to yell them out. Sadly, there is only one of us who can fly, and very busy right now. I was holding my action for this. Maljikaori? Maorikalji! Malkaoriji! 24. You basically just got Netflix, that's really all that happened. We're not going to die, we're doing great. I'm going to use my shield to glance off the 21. I'm going to use the shield of plus five AC. Versus AC of 23. It gives me a temporary AC of 23. No, because I was holding my-- It's all part of the plan. I said Jamalkaori last time, if I recall. Kaorijimal. All right. I'm going to, while I'm saying all these things I'm going to be running around the corner back towards the spiderweb. Make another one. We said, Maljikaori-- Jimalkaori. Is that as far as I can move right now? Okay, I can't get any closer to the web? Kamaljiori? Hello. It is most gracious of you. Very much so. I know, obviously. I'm so excited. I've got a weird question I'm going to throw out there. Did you pick your sword back up before all this mess happened?
