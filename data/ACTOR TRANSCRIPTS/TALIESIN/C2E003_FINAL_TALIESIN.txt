Classic, classic. No burger left. Just onion rings. Eight. That's a number. It was such a good idea. I don't want to be a fucking zombie. They did run by. Oh, fancy. Everything. I'm going to burst out of the tent. Can I make it to the one that Beau is fighting? I'm going to make it to the one that Beau is fighting and I'm going to take two straight attacks with my scimitar. That's a 15 and a natural 20. Without even figuring out, yeah. Natural 20 is just double the die, right? First one is (counting) 15? No, double, I have to roll two dice, right? Okay, that's fine. That's nine points of damage. Then two dice or double the dice? That's 13 points of damage. I turn and smile at Beau. It's a pizza pie with a pizza slice. I turn 180 and get ready for the other one. I make eye contact with it and, fuck it, just for fun I'm going to burn my blood maledict. There's going to be a blood vessel that pops on my neck and I'm going to make him cry. I take three damage. I'm amplifying. No. It still hits. That's fine. Ow. There's no way we're going to be able to take this shit seriously. Undead strength. I'm going to take two more shots, I'm going to see if I can decapitate-- Oh man! I've got to get out of that habit. Two more swings, see if I can decapitate it. That's an eight. But a 16 does not. That's nine points of damage. This is not looking good. This is looking very bad. Oh my god. I swear I thought I could kill it. That hits. Oh yeah, I'm out. I think I'm immune to fire, anyways or some such thing. Yeah, fire resistance. Out, but not dead. I've just started working on a new character tonight. Thank god. (gasps) (groans) One of them has my sword embedded in their chest. I'm at one hit point? They're okay. Really? Are you going to name it Sally? I had that coming. I'm going to pull my sword back out and start trying to get the horses going. That really hurt. I feel terrible. I can do that. I can do that. No, I'm fine. I'm going to actually fall back into the cart. Everything that you've been holding back for years now is going to come pouring out of you. Okay. Trying to take as much of a short rest as I can back there. I'm going to try and sleep this off like a bad hangover. Like dogs, we never looked up. That would be a very big toad. The wagon tracks directly to the point at which they are found. Who are you? That's really clever. Why would you even think that? Huh. Maybe. I don't know. I'll think about it. Ow, that hurts. Ow. That was a lot. Well, this will break my short rest. How many people in the boat? How many people are we looking for? Didn't he leave with a-- Two people? I'm actively tracking this creature, aren't I on a certain level? I hadn't really thought about it. It's something I can in theory do. No. This would also break my short rest, wouldn't it? I'm going to use Hunter's Bane really quickly and look at the track for a second. Yeah, I'm going to do both of those. Now I'm at 12 hit points. Yay 12 hit points. I'm going to see if I can help with the tracking because I'm going to start actively tracking this particular creature. Survival check? Which I have advantage on. 18. Guy went into the water. Do you think he's trying to swim all the way to the other side or you think he's just going around the lake? I don't know. I'm not sure. Maybe. Could be. I legitimately do not know how it works. Sorry. Do I know what he was, by the way? And I get advantage on that. Religion check? 15. This whole time I've been sitting with this. Are you saying this out loud? Listening to this, I reach in. I've got some incense. Isn't this impressive enough that I happen to have some incense? There'd also be a fire inside the inn, to be fair. Charcoal is-- it's not like it's hard to get. That's true, you can go shopping more. Let's go maintain the illusion of innocence for the evening. Xhorhas. It's a creature from Xhorhas. I'm pretty sure, I don't know. We'll see. God, I'm remembering something. I'm going to walk over to the horses and-- they're trained horses. I'm going to go whisper in their ear and give them a little pat. Nine. I didn't get advantage on that because I knew the animals, did I? I'm into this. This is Romper Room! Natural 20. Look at all that stuff! I can't even see myself with this roll. Technically, my stealth would be 23. When you hit 'long rest', it should auto-reset. Slightly hotter, okay. Way hotter. Any toad creatures? Oh, the first piece of paper of the game! Have you read it now? What's it say? Kylre's been around for a while, though! And this is new, right? I feel like-- Was there nothing? I mean, not that well. Of everybody, the least. That's a-- I have heard that word before. Oh dear. Oh, why can't I remember? It was so long ago. What did he eat? He ate what we had! I feel like I would've taken note of it. I don't necessarily know I would've commented on it, but I would've noted it. And it was not noted. Oh no. It's not possible he's trying to head back to Xhorhas, is it? I said out loud. Kylre was not a talker. Stabbing? Can I also do this? I'm thinking about everything I hear. Nine. Clusters of semen all around you. Always funny. Always. Wait, what? You could read that other book, at the very least. I go into my bag and I've got some old, weird-- I've got a weird little-- It's in a very strange, ornate bag that's covered in strange gems and weird filigree. Sandalwood. It's nag champa all over. Enough about the pastries already. Yes, of course. I'm in for a penny. I'm going to throw a gold in there as well. I just saw Jester open her purse. Dear--! The ten minutes is clean-up. (laughter) Go ahead. He's a little feathery Frumpkin. You look like a princess. Well, if we can send the sparrow out, we can carry him with us if he finds anything. Let's let the sparrow see if it can find anything. Then we know which direction we have to head into so there's not too much meandering about. Until there's a direction to go. Play-Doh, we've got Play-Doh. Well, we're not going to get our deposit back. That makes it worse. It's pretty fancy. I'll keep with you. I'd forgotten about that. We were in the middle of things. It's usually Gustav. If somebody's got an act, they show it off, Gustav figures out how it's going to work into the narrative. Puts it all together. You bring a bit, and then the bit is shaped and formed by the director of the show. If you can do a thing with fire or you can do some juggling, and then they figure out how that's going to work into everything. Where it sits and what costuming, and the whole thing is all an act. Mostly. Mostly an act. Oh, you're thinking of Toya and Kylre? They were an act before-- They were an act for as long as I can remember, right? Yeah, I've never not known them as an act. I'm feeling like maybe that might be a thing. Well, I mean, everyone's got some weird. We're weird people. People come in and you're a bit strange, you got something you can do. No. No. Well, that's a complicated conversation, but no. She is a little girl, to be fair. Toya's not a fully-grown adult woman. She's a dwarf. That is so offensive. I think you're right, but I don't know how he's managed to go this long. Why now, and why in front of all those people? I think he is a fiend. I think he is feeding off her. The rest of it I'm not sure. Have you met us? We're all a bit weird, and you don't ask a ton of questions. There is. It's the difference between being in a carnival and not being in a carnival. Because I'm weird! I mean, it's putting together. He was never that talkative. I don't know. I don't like it. Well! I am not the right kind of talker for this. Why does every roll have to be-- Oh thank god. 18. This is why we don't have you as DM. We can also follow the bird. I miss the earrings. Yeah, no, I'm over cloak. Two-Gold Bold. Well! (laughter) That is our siren's call. No aerator? (laughter) You've ruined it. I'm going to keep my eyes peeled as well. (growls and sighs) Eight. I was weirdly expecting more. I don't even know how you did that! Don't do the math. Before you do, let's take a look around. I'm going to take a look around to see if I can find any footprints. Can I use my (mumbles) again, or no? I'm specifically looking for signs of Kylre. Wow, that's awful. Wait, that's cocked. That's awful. I can't even-- that's eight. That's right, we've got some humans. Oh wow. We can start heading in. It was awful. I let all of you go first everywhere. Or for a witch's hut. Let's put the humans in the middle, so that they can't be surprised. Again. Hey! There's my good roll! 19. There's that magic we never had. She ate what was put in front of her. We ate what was put in front of us. We're not picky people. I'm trying to keep an eye out for anything. Even if we weren't here on business, I really want to see this. I'll do it. I'll go for it. I don't get advantage on this. No, okay. God. Six. I did not sneak that in, did I? Yeah, I'm all right with that. 18. I'm going to pull out both my swords, and I'm going to drag them-- LAURA and I'm not doing my accent right now. So I'm going to pull out both the swords, and I'm going to drag them on the back of my neck, and before the blood even begins to pour, it goes straight into ice along the blades. Action, bonus action. Action and bonus action. I can't turn an action to a bonus action? All right, that's fair. Okay. I'm going to move around and I'm going to try and get a little cover right here. I'm going to move there, and I'm going to hold my attack until there's something to hit. I'm going to try and make a little wave at Yasha. Toya. Ah, brain. Yeah. 20. I'm so proud of you. What?! Hexblade's Curse? Opening your mouth right there. That was so useful! So useful! Yep, that hit me. (laughter) That's a 13? That's a 1d6 plus 1d4. That's eight damage plus one cold damage, so nine damage. Five points of damage and a constitution saving throw. Constitution saving throw. Goddamn it. 11. So I just took-- That's a lot. I'm going to use my bonus action, take a slash at that imp. I can only use it as an action, right? Okay, I'll burn my attack hitting that bloody imp. No, I'll hit it with the enchanted one. I'm really hurt and I just took nine points of damage. Yeah, 19 to hit. That's seven points of damage. I'm going to pull back behind this tree trunk then and get a little cover to figure out what to do next, because I'm really hurt. Yeah. I can't heal or anything. My god, I can't do anything. 16. Ah, learning. Jesus, these things are so vicious. Oh my god. (groaning) Shit. LIAM and I'm going to get a little closer, I'm going to start running towards the ruins. That'll do it. I'm going to look at the imp and I'm, in Infernal, I'm going to say, to just-- terrible There's nothing but death for you here. I'm going to attack Vicious Mockery on him and show him the bottom card. I have to learn some-- Yeah, that's a-- Yeah, it's a wisdom saving throw. I'm trying to figure out how this works but-- It's not a lot, but that's four points of psychic damage and he has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes. That was just my bonus action, I'm going to use my action-- No that's a-- it is an action, you're right. That's what I've got right now. Just trying to get its attention. Oh my god. We're not doing well. He's the only one who's down but we're all hurt. Oh god, no. Fuck, man. Glad you didn't do Detect Evil? He can't follow you. Both have disadvantage. Vicious Mockery. Part of the plan! You have so few actions. Does that work? There is no body? We need a body! Oh thank god. Is that imp still there? Is the imp still active? I'm going to Blood Maledict. I'm going to Curse of the Eyeless on that imp. The one that is attacking Nott. Oh for fuck's sake. I'm running at the closest imp. Can I get there? All right, I'm going to take two swings. For fuck's sake. Nope. That was a ten. Can you bonus action anybody? Stabilize someone? That's smart. You could dash. She has got two more rounds regardless. Yay! How are you doing, man? This is-- oh man, one imp is going to kill us all. One fucking imp. We have to stabilise Fjord, is what we've got to do. Caleb? Caleb's doing okay. I'm running right at it. Let's try some different dice here. For fuck's sake! I've got to stop rolling that die. This is-- yeah, no. 11? This is so embarrassing. This is so embarrassing. Do you get advantage because I'm engaged with it? Ugh, look at it scoot! God! I was about to say, I'm going to run to Toya and pick her up. I've got her. I've got her. I've got her. Because you were the last face she saw? I should probably be the first. Thank you. You did the right thing. You don't need to be the first thing she sees. She'll just start screaming all over again. Thank you. We're going to need him. That's definitely a cloister. It's a nu-gget. (sighs) Get her back home. I know. We're going to have a talk. I don't know if she feels that way either, but although-- it's going to take some time, I think. And also, we're going to need the body, and honestly, only one of us was here. For those at home, I'm pointing at Caleb. Because the rest of us are under arrest. So congratulations on single-handedly defeating the creature that killed several guards. I'm sure you will be well-rewarded and compensated. Let's take a rest. That was so unpleasant. I think I'm going to multiclass. Master of none.
