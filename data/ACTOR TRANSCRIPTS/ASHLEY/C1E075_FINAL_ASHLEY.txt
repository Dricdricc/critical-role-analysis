(wind noises) (whip sound) (cat snarling) (awful yet great impression of bagpipes) (laughter) That guy's hot! Is he single? Aw. Seven. I burn to death. I'm just feeling so tired. You seem a little bit nervous. I can't really tell because you're so strange in a wonderful way. (laughter) Thank you. Okay. Bigger than him? Oh. I'll give it a try. Oh, definitely not. Just doesn't even move. That's a seven. Got to take a second to switch hands. I'll go backwards, I'll go backwards. Okay. (clanging sound effects) (imitates Senokir) Great. What kind of ways? Let's? Do we just knock? It's engraved with something? I don't think he's telling the truth. We'll hold it. That's a 14. Grog, maybe you should hold it then because we're not as strong as you. That doesn't sound true. Safe than sorry, we'll just hold it. We're safe. If I cast Enhance Ability on him? But take the shield, too, though. Take the shield! What about best out of five? You're probably so bored with life; why not? One more hand? With a saving throw? So roll another. Three! My what's halved? Grog, I'm just so tired. I feel very mopey. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm just not working right now. Did he look scary? What kind of slaves did it look like he had? All types? And also, if they had skills, each of them had a separate skill? Opium den style. Should one of us sleep in his house? Grog, what's wrong? Well, if we have a book or something, I could. A Beginning to Read Giant, is there anything like that where I could know what the letters are? Just Common letters? Yes, I can show you the alphabet. I'll write it out. Okay? Do you know how to spell your name? Okay. It's very easy. You have four letters in your name, but there are two of the same letter. So you really only have three letters in your name. Okay, well, we won't talk about numbers. Okay, what's the first letter of the alphabet? This you know. That's the first letter of your name. Yes, but that's not the first letter of the alphabet. You've said it before. Ah-- Oh! It's the first letter, well, you wouldn't know that, because you don't know how to spell. Oh! You said it! A! A is the first letter of the alphabet. And we can keep going-- (laughter) Did I at least teach him how to spell his name? We'll keep working on it. You sleep so well, okay? No! That's so cute! Before I go to sleep, I am going to cast Lesser Restoration on myself, to maybe get rid of one point of exhaustion. I'll cast Greater Restoration before bed. So we're all going to look like Vax? And Vex. All the girls are going to look like Vex. You're so rich, you want us clean. Like Princess Leia, Jabba the Hut. Can you hide them under a cape? And if a slave can do that, that's pretty special. Maybe you can do some flair as people are walking by. You could just say, Angels for sale! No, no, my name is Vex. Sure. And don't be scared. I'll bow as well. He gets a glimpse, yeah. Of course, sir. We tried so hard. I'll be behind them. I won't be here next week. I don't know. Stuffs and stuffs.
