Who is it? Who is it? Like a glyph situation? I could do such a thing. (sing) Too much love drives a man insane. I have an idea! I have an idea. I'm going to-- I would like to cast Earthquake-- And maybe I can wiggle it all closed. It's just one action. I'm going to Fire Storm them. How do you feel, Tary? But why do we have to go? I'm just kidding. (laughter) You could refinance! I want to get in a circle, like a dog, on one of the cushions. Hello. Sir, may I have your hand, please? May I have your hand? Not in marriage, I worded that strangely. Just your hand that's hurt. Understood. What's a lot? We're not doing this now! What's happening? What is happening? We're just hungry! We're just hungry. Everybody needs to calm down. How do you know the Mean Man? What was the third one, though? This is very important, but... Why is he your boss? What do you do? What kind of work are you in? Do you know someone named Kaylie? So he didn't send you here to hurt us? Just to come. What does the Meat Man mean to you? You don't need to get upset with him for it. Do you know... the Meat Man? Did he tell you to take on his name? Wait, why did you think we would want this information? We could hold a spelling bee! I make my way through. What's going on? I think I'll go with you, Tary. It's fine. Oh, is that what gnomes do? They go into the forest? I'm so sorry, please continue. Well, that's debatable. Can I insight-check him? 23. I think I hear something. Do you hear that? It sounds like small little violins that I hear. Do you hear that? I forgot I had to talk to Percy about something. Bye. Good to see you. Yeah. Scanlan, can you hear me now? I take out my earpiece. I take a seat on a bar stool and just start drinking. (deadpan) Grog, stop, no, don't kill him. I punch him across the face. (cheering) I'm pretty awesome. I finish my ale, flick a money on the bar, and leave. Oh shit, I don't have any money, because I gave it all away. Tary, Tary? I left after him. Hey! Oh, nothing. Just hanging out. Just having a drink. I'm going to go take a nap, I'm very tired. I'm great! I'm all right. Just going to sleep it off, I think. Yeah, I'm feeling very drunk, so I'm going to go to bed. I'm a pickled Pickle, yeah. But I'll see you guys tomorrow. Sleep is the best medicine. Yeah. What do you want? Oh, but we already said hello. I'll open the door. Yes? Yeah. Yeah. I slap him across the face. Do you know... Do you remember what you said, before you left? I mean, obviously you said lots of things. But there was one thing in particular that's always bothered me. You said that you were kept alive by some weird fucking magic. And that's what I do. And I brought you back so you could be with your daughter. So fuck you. Sure. And you know what, I apologize for putting you in my clothes, but the Scanlan that we know would've thought that was funny. I'm sorry I didn't know your mother, but I imagine you don't know my mother's name. So you like who you are better without us? I don't care what you do. Well. Perhaps we'll meet again in different circumstances. Okay. Good night. Yes, I can hear you. We'll still be right behind you. No. Oh, you're still here. I throw him a bag of cookies. So we opened a bakery while you were gone. We have these. They're called shorties. They're after you. So hopefully you like them. Yeah. Serendipitous.
