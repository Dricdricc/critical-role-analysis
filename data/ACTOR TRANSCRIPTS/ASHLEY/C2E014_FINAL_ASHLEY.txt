Please, just come. Me too. D&D Beyond! Yes! Oh, guys, come on, this is the best! Oh man, I love you guys. I have a Pike one, because we haven't established what Yasha's thing is yet. We'll figure out who she is together. Hey! So? Okay, it's been a minute. Hey, you guys walked right past me in the bar upstairs so I decided to-- I've been right behind you the whole time, I don't know how you didn't know I was here. I'm glad to see you too, Mollymauk. It's Lucien! We pretty much know all of it, so. I do, I know all of it, so you can just tell me if you want to. I got a ten, but technically I know-- I'm rolling at advantage? 16. Was he your new path? I'll stand. Well, I hang out with them, but I actually like the drinks here a lot, so. Fair enough. I take my finger and I run it across my blade as I stare at him. He's awesome. How long do you keep our blood for? But we get it back when we're done? Or we decide not to work with you anymore? Okay. TRAVIS and Do I see him point at me? I put my hand on my hilt and I pull it out a little bit. I think you should deal with this. Does any of this sound familiar to you from the past? Would you like us to call you Lucien or do you want us to call you Molly? Sometimes I have things to do, I barely know you guys, so sorry if I leave! Pretty shit luck for you, then. That has nothing to do with me. Thank you very much, Beau. Thank you. Sometimes I need to leave. Plus, I barely know you guys. We'll see. I think I did. I think I'm looking for answers for something, and I don't know if I received any more, but I'm still looking. I don't know if you can. Thank you, Nott. I'll stick around and offer my strength as much as I can. You guys are going to Xhorhas? I saw that. TRAVIS and I was here. I've been here the whole time. I was trying to figure some shit out. I like to get away from things sometimes. That's all I'd like to do. Wait, what was the Xhorhas bit? I'm from Xhorhas. Probably not where they were from. I don't think I'm where they're from. I'm more southern parts of Xhorhas. No, I don't know exactly where they were from. I don't know who they are, I don't know anything about them. Okay. Make sure that's correct, actually. Yes. For about-- I don't know, when did I meet you? Year and a half. (singing) We're waiting to find out, but I'll be here for a minute now. Back to the game. But she's sick. Okay. Moontouched. I really saved up for the sword that I have. I thank you guys for thinking of me, but-- I'll hold on to it. It's taller than Nott? What do you think, Fjord? No, by all means. I think I'm a bit attached to my sword. That's a shame, because I wanted to get it back. (laughs) Fuck off. I was there in spirit. I mean, this is not about me right now. It doesn't need to be. Listen, I've never pushed you to talk about anything. If you don't feel comfortable, you don't owe any of us anything. Hey, money! 13. I didn't realize you didn't. You did a good job at pretending. Too late. I feel like-- it's a very good Laura. Yes, of course there are people here that I think are very attractive and charming, but that doesn't mean I will act on that. This was the first time that's happened. I knew that he woke up and that he did not know who he was, but this was the first time that this has happened. Where someone has come to us and recognized him from his past. I think were quite an amazing person-- I do feel like you actually, weirdly, have a gift for that. Well, I'll have to look at my tattoo database. (laughter) Pumats? Okay. What's it called? Isn't he Pumat? Oh, you guys are twins? Okay. Okay. Hello. They're like pointy things that you throw and they're metal. Darts, daggers-- darts. Oh! I don't. That's actually-- I wanted to get some. Let's see. Just want to double check to see if I do. Yeah. Do you have some healing potions? Well, they're the Mighty Nein. (laughter) How much are they? So does that mean that the-- I've seen a deal somewhere with somebody, also threw in some healing spells when they bought a cloak? Is that a thing? Yeah. My charisma's fucked. 14. I'll take them. Thank you. Yeah, I have no money. Nice to meet you. That's a-- I've never seen any-- I thought they were related and then they all have the same name so I guess that's another thing. Listen. I realize I'm not great with people. Just no need to point it out. Oh. I forgot about that. Yes, I did. Well, what do we need-- Nein. Well, she gave you the money. Well maybe that will make her like you more. Why do you think that? The only reason I might disagree is because she did give you money. What are you going to do with the rest of the money? Okay. Can I test one out? Nope. Seven. No, sorry. Nine. Fuck, sorry. Admittedly, I'm not good at throwing things, but it looked really cool. Beau, Caleb got these for you. There were 20, but one of them fell out of the bag. One of them's missing, but I think it fell out of the-- I think it fell out of the bag. Okay. I'll be behind Grog-- Fjord. Okay. Well, we'll find out. Yes, I do.
