You know you've got him when he has projectile tears. It seems opposite of what should be happening. PulloutKing, thanks for the laughs. I was like barnacles! She already said that. Six. The fun buns! Full sprint ahead. He's blinded now. I forgot to go to the bathroom. I'm wiggling. Can I make it over east? Let's go east, near his butt. How far can I get? I'm going to hit him in the arse with the Magician's Judge. Reckless. 15. Yeah. Oh shit, that's so bad. Double unos. Five points of damage! Okay. We're going to die. We're going to live. Okay, okay, okay. Yes! Okay. That's so true. Because I did Reckless like a ding-dong. Yeah. I'm dumb. Well that definitely hits. I'm probably going to be unconscious. I don't know why I did Reckless. I'm learning, I should have waited. Am I perma-dead? How many? Okay. I'm just unconscious. Is that right? No. Okay. Do I add anything? A seven. (gasps) Okay. He's rolling well. That's okay. I'll take it. Oh, thank you. I add that here? Yeah. Thank you, Jester. I give her an awkward side hug. Oh. I want to put points down on his-- I feel like you could do the most damage. Good game. Fucking old. I just like the idea of the formation. Hello. I am Yasha. Thank you very much. Do you want me to do the talking? TRAVIS and I was kidding. Fjord, can you come-- We're all going to go, right? Wait, but I was actually kidding. I know, but-- (sighs) Okay. Do you want to take the lead? I can't even imagine the beauty. Thank you very much. What were you fighting? The Kryn dynasty, they are from northern Xhorhas? I am... from... Xhorhas. Not very long. About, let's see, maybe eight months or something? I travel. I left. (stammers) I chose not to live there anymore. I just, you know, it's not a great place to live. It's awful. It's marsh and it's not a comfortable place to live. Seven. Because I have a negative. Yes, I most definitely am. I can assure you I don't stand for anything bad from the Xhorhas and I am here to help. Okay. Yes, that's me. Great. Same here, because this was great conversation. Ah, you know. But to be clear, do you know what you're fighting? Just if you're fighting-- I just wanted to know if you were fighting the Kryn. I wish you the best of luck. Okay. Where did he say we could meet up? Rexxentrum? I figured it's like one of those things, that if you're going to get caught, you might as well tell the truth because it's easier to remember. I don't know. I panicked. I don't think so. Did I say anything that was bad? Oh, I said both of those things. Either that, or they think that I'm a Xhorhasian assassin, and I am not. It's the Kryn dynasty. No. Well, I don't know if that is any of your business at this time. I'm not on any side, but I do think what we are fighting is something very terrible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we heard about them in the north and they're mostly dark elves that settled in a massive ruin that was completely forbidden for us to travel to. Yeah. The ones that went there. They do keep their skies dark. It's some kind of dark magic that we don't know of that keeps the sun away. They've enslaved men and beasts and demons under their banner. I've never been there because it's hard to get there and it's not someplace I would want to go alone. I've heard stories, but never anybody personally. I've always been curious. Just to see with my own eyes, but they've done so many bad things that I would want to fight them. I don't know. You charge for these services? Oh. I don't agree. I feel like you would be very good at it. Okay. I'm maybe showing a little bit of pink on my cheeks. Caleb, what did you say? Guten-- Gluten almonds. Yeah, I have my feet linked so I can monkey piggy-back ride. Four gold for two rooms? What kind of companionship do you have here available? I don't know, just one that I-- maybe lots? Let's make one for adults! But you don't need to give us money. It looks like she loves you very much, too. Plus, 200 gold is a lot of money. That's more than I pretty much have right now. Jester, it's your money. And otherwise? A rat-- Well, we can get them here, and then save those for another-- Well, yeah. I am pretty hungry. You don't like to cook yours? Nott, that's crazy. I mean, I'll try it, but I feel like it's much-- Do you want me to have them cook it? Have you ever had it cooked? With a little salt, little pepper. No? What do they have? Are you sure you won't take it? Do you promise me? Okay. We were going to play some Truth or Dare. Fjord and Jester made out. Wait, I roll, too. I roll, too, because I was part of the lie. I rolled a four. May I take a look at that map, Jester? That's a good idea. That was crazy. I wonder if there's any way to find out somehow what it is before accepting. Yeah. What? What do you mean you get control of your fate? Can you go back and--? Do you want to try it? I'm going in? Okay. Do you feel like you have control over your fate? Yeah, we should explore this idea, but maybe. Oh, what does it do? No. We'll come back for another day. 10,000 gold is a lot of money. Yeah. I'll help you. Okay. That's something. Should we say our goodbyes to Orentha? What does the contract entail? How long are we in contract with you? Just for this, or--? That's an option. That's true. d12? Nice. 11? Plus two? That's right. No, that's a big deal.
