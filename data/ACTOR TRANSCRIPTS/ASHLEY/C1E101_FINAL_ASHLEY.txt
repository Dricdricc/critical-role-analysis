Thank you, Keyleth, for bringing me back. What if we blocked off that entrance when we go inside? You're not planning on going with us? Well, I do think we could use the help. Are you jealous of him? He is part of the team. I wish I could help, Tary, but I think that's out of my... Well... No, you can't give him that jewelry box! I'm going to help! I'm going to help you. Yeah. Keyleth's got our back. She'll burrow in and pull us out. Yeah. Okay. I jump on your back now? Like a backpack? Oh, I hit it. Yeah boi. No, guys, that doesn't need to be anywhere. 13. I try to wrap my legs around, but they don't go. Me too. Okay okay, 16. Just going to start kicking him in the side. Okay, okay, okay! Good job! We're getting somewhere. But we still need-- there's still more to do? Okay. Thanks! We did pretty good. I'm hungry! We'll check it! Six. You know what, Grog? As hungry as I am, I think we should wait to have Keyleth look at this fruit. Because it's outside of this cave, and what if it's a distraction like, "Oh, lookit!" and you eat it and you just die? And when fruit goes bad, it turns into wine! I think I'm going to wait for Keyleth. Does it taste good? Maybe make some mayonnaise or something? Want some mayonnaise to cleanse your palate? Oh, all right! No, Grog! Yeah, you guys should try it. Should we take some, then? And not only that, you're going to be the leader of a band of adventurers. I've been an extra set of eyes in the library. Scanlan? The Scanlan wood! I could certainly try. I think that's actually a fantastic idea. I'll see what I can do. Yeah. I'll see what I can do. Vex, I have some holy oil? I don't know. I just have a vial of it. I don't know how much that is. Probably good for two applications. For my Hawaiian poke bowl mascot. (laughter) Is there a way that I can bless these bullets? Well, I could start it, depending on when we leave, I guess. I have Bless. I was looking at that, but I didn't know I could use that on actual objects, other than people. (whispering) 11. So if it breathes, it will die. You stick your hand in there all the time. No? I could try. Can I check it out and see if it's cursed? We're already there? We're standing at the ball? (whispering) I thought we bamfed into it. Six. Before we get to it, can I cast Bless on his bullets so I can give them back to him? Not very long. When it's done. I'd rather enchant them. 21. What was it eating? 23. Maybe that's what we need to look like. I do. I put my hand over his eye. Are you ready to have your eye back? Well, you can't. Because you're just going to stay in these binds forever. How does he get through all the dead? What's his purpose? Grab his necklace in case we need another one for some reason.
