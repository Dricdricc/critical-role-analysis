Oh, can we make a body scrub? I'm going to take a little bit, too. I have it. I have the eyeball in the box. (laughs) Ew. Could I put my hand in the water? Just a (doot). Okay. Guys, it feels so nice. Should we go for just a little bit of a swim while he attunes to his-- I love you, Kiki. I'll go first. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to pull out the key again. Yeah. Sarenrae, we have travelled very far and we are here and if you could give us any guidance to get closer to you I would be forever grateful. Yeah. Okay, I repeat that again in my head. Yeah. Say again? Yeah. Okay. I'll keep walking and I'll keep looking back, thumbs up, and I'll see what I can find. Good, good. Just traveling over these stone structures. Does it look like I've gotten far? I feel like I've gone real far. I'm going to stand there and think about being closer to the tower with my eyes closed. So I'll try keeping my eyes closed and start walking towards it. Hey, guys, can you see me? LAURA and I just thought about it. I closed my eyes and I started walking. Maybe you can only get here if you're a believer of Sarenrae. (singing) I'm a believer. Come on, Grog. Okay. How long will it take me to walk back to them? I want to walk back to them. Okay. Where's Vex? Okay. Come here. I have an idea. Okay? So everybody, hold onto me somehow. Yeah. Yeah. Just don't let go. And I'm going to think real hard, and maybe we'll all be there together. LAURA and That tickles. Yes. Look at this. It's so much more beautiful up close. I take a knee. Thank you for letting us come here. It's just such an honor to be in your presence and to meet you in person. I've been a believer of yours for my whole life, and to actually be here in front of you is very humbling. Well, I think last time we spoke, we took on a battle that we were not able to complete and we need your help. I take out the box. Well, I would always hope that in somebody, but at least the time spent with him that we have, it doesn't seem that that's his path. Okay. Oh my goodness! What is that? Okay. Okay. Man, I love her so much. Oh man! Same. I just thought I wanted to take a little piece with me, but I already have that. I didn't know what it was. I would have told you before we left, you know. Don't eat it. Just in case! I have an idea! Why don't you hold onto it. Keep it in your pouch. You can ask him if the fruit is edible, and make sure it's not people. Oh, I have it, actually. I'll try to take it over-- I'm going to leave it on the ground; it's a little hot over there. I do, too. Am I close enough to Grog to hop onto the carpet, as well? Yeah! Blessings of the gods! I know, I miss you guys! I love you, guys. Man, to think I almost didn't Skype in tonight.
