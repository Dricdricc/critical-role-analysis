Dungeons & Dragons! Eat my shorts, dude! Now it's even better with D&D Beyond, with high speed internet, WiFi or a smartphone you can access your stats and more on your iPad or laptop. Gag me with a spoon, Mrs. Henderson. You were. You did great. 14. 14. Dang it, maybe we can still talk. 19. Are we attacking him? I feel like we got off on the wrong foot. I don't know if he has feet. (laughter) Shit! Already off to a bad start. You said, "My secrets are yours." Did you want to give us a secret? Okay, I'm going to take out my sword, and I'm going to attack. What's going on at the bottom of his-- Shit, I don't like going first! Okay, I'm going to attack with my sword. No. I'm raging. I would like to rage. 18. Eight plus-- Yeah, ten. My Moon-touched sword. Yes, that's my turn. Eight! TRAVIS and Guys, we're doing fine. That's already $500. Okay. Ah fuck. Yeah. 18. Can I also add Divine Fury on-- I know. (counting) Plus what? 11. Whoa, what's happening in my brain? 13. Plus seven you said? 20. That was my attack of opportunity. I'll make my body all strong. Okay! I'm going to attack him again. Yes! 19. All the stuffs? 14. Yeah. The little interior bit, what is it again? Can I punch it? All done. I rolled a four. I was trying to see it as a positive thing. Three hit points, guys. I've got three hit points. Do I? Fuck! Good job, Molly. I'm still stunned? What if we have to get it with the sword? Seven. Oh, shit. Yeah! Disadvantage would mean it was--? The lowest number, okay. I didn't know if it-- okay, three. Oh, sorry, five. Six! Okay, I'm unconscious? I do have, hold on-- I thought I had something. It's not now? I'm unconscious. Right, okay. It's okay. Get the bookcase. Jester, thank you for healing me. I feel like I did not deserve that, but thank you very much. Six. I am, but I might have lost count. Yeah, it does. I can dig it open a little bit. Could be worth a pretty penny. I walk over and just start hitting. Let me try and see if-- Okay. Whoa! Hello? I don't think so. I like it. You know, we can-- I don't know. Do you see it? Do we all have to go inside to talk to him? I feel like rich people like candlesticks, so I could take the candlesticks with us. They're antique, you know, for decoration? They'll probably want those instead of the sword. What if I have you on my shoulders? Like a kid? We put-- behind us. It's connected to-- That's not going to work. I can slip it up my back and then you can be on my shoulders like you're tired or something? Nott can put her legs out. I would like to get in a boat with Caleb. And Nott. I'll watch over these guys. Okay, Nott. Much better. I would like to sit and attune to the sword. Wait, is that why what? They will always grow back, even if you--? Did you kill any of the children that made fun of you? If you have to go to battle, if you have a challenge, you kill somebody. Do you ever want them to stay there? Yeah. Is this a bad-- should I stay outside or something? Or he can challenge me, and I can, you know. Hans and Franz? I got 20. Not a natural. Uh oh. A seven. Oh, yes. Try to settle the cloak to-- I still have it with me. Was I supposed to leave it behind? I want to keep it so maybe we can sell the Moon-Touched Sword. Could we have put it in the-- Sorry. I totally forgot about that. Just lean up against the wall while. Also some candlesticks. I didn't keep mine. Probably the two leftover coins that he put in the eyeballs are still there. What were you looking for, anyway? No! Do you still keep the blood vials that you-- Yeah. Okay. It's very strange how you're very dense. I feel it's a lot heavier than you look. May I have one of those? I'm going to look at it, and then I'm going to give it back to you. Does it say any more? You literally just-- that's all that's on there. Wasn't The Gentleman supposed to reward us? No, you guys go. Oh well here. I always partake what-- Well, there's something I need to go do. You guys get started and I'll-- I know, but you know I always take it and I never feel anything. (laughter) How do you feel? Do you see anything? Is it interesting? Can I have tried to find any information on the conflict on the Xhorhas border? Six. MATT. You're not the best at gathering Information. Maybe it's the-- (deep voice) Hey! Conflict! Xhorhas?! Tell me. To the north? There's the Ashkeep. May I sell my other sword? I sharpen it. It's so sharp. I sharpen it every night. It's touched by the moon. I paid all of my money for this, and it was so much more than that. 11. Yeah. It actually was. Yeah, okay. Okay. Thank you, Pumat. (whispers) It wasn't my first sword. (laughter) True love's kiss. It's all it says again! How do they give you more information? Just a headline; there's nothing else! Like we did for the winter festival at our home game?
