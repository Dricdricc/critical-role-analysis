Do you send an actual message, or is it a piece of paper? Ooh. To get that 100 gold back? Throw it in and see how it goes, and then we can run if he's-- How do we know if he's in there, though? I'll go behind Caleb. It'll get hungry. Maybe later. Oh, no! I feel a little exposed. Frumpkin's not going in? Yeah. Yeah. Great idea. I have... I probably can't hear you guys. I have a tinderbox. Okay, I'll light it. What? Mine is like, two! 12. Moving on up! He can regenerate? I don't want to move close to it. May I hold my action until it gets-- I know it's a surprise attack, I just don't have any ranged weapons or anything. I can go up and hit him. Okay, let me move around by Beau. Yeah, next to Beau. I'm holding an attack. Is he looking rough? Just a straight roll, yeah? 11. I made it. You're telling me there's a chance. Yeah. Do you want to move? Okay. I know we can't go up and slash, and that's all I can do, but can I-- I can't do it. I'll just take damage. I'm already low. Yeah. I know. I'm already nervous. Could I take a torch and throw it at him? Oh no. Seven. Is he looking at it? I'm going to go back as far as I can. Still would have been shit. I roll for a save on the poison? 17. Good call. Come on, lollipop. 100 gold! What? That is so cool! We could just cut off its head. Come. On! Yes! (laughter) So I'm going to move forward, grab the other side, that she doesn't have, and pull him. How far back can I pull him? Here we go. I'm going to start walking over towards where the skulls are. Yeah, what happened? You good? Okay. You took care of the problem. Hard. What book are you reading? Yes. Yes. I would love that. Okay, would you like me to try to-- Okay. You could just be looking. Yes, Uma, they are like a sky blue. This is going to drive me crazy. I'm going to go up to the bar. Hello. Here's the thing. You've made this very intriguing, this book that you're reading, and I can't leave here without knowing what it is. My intimidation is minus two but we said we can use-- No, no. That would be a zero. Because I rolled a two, and my charisma is minus two. I will give you privacy, I just don't understand why we can't know what you're reading. Because it looks like it's very good! I will go sit down, fine. I miss reading. I miss it a lot. I want to know what she's reading. Yeah, I'll go with you guys. You know what? I'm going to go with Fjord to get the cart. Okay. Just in case you need backup. If we need to kill them, we can. We had to kill them all, but we got it. That man Trent Ikithon or whatever is in Rexxentrum. Yeah, that Trent guy. Yeah, don't you remember? When we talked to him he said if we wanted to meet up with him to talk more, he was in Rexxentrum. I've heard gnome parties are the craziest kind. That's all you need is diamonds? I'll keep watch. 15. Yeah... Yeah. I mean, one's like more purpley, but I guess that's sky, or swamp? Yeah... Like a... I think that's a film? I start walking towards the-- 16. Yeah, I'm swinging wide. Go around. Take the blankets. Are there any flowers that are even visible at this area? Perception check? 18. I reach down and I take it and put it in my book. Yeah. I'll get more. Yeah. A little crazy? But the following week I'll be here.
