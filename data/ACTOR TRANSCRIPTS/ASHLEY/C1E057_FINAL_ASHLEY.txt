I love that shirt. Yeah. It's going to be one at the break? It's going to be a giveaway at the break? I'm just going to start making stuff up. Point, shoot. Bulldog. Shih tzu. Can we bring it in? It's so badass! I wonder if we should show a close-up or something. It's so sexy. (singing) Goodbye, my love! Thanks, Joe! I love it so much. What is that. Ohhh. It's so good. I saw it yesterday and today because I just couldn't not watch it again. Let's just pretend for a little bit. And then I'll check in later. There's no rush to get there. At least, that I know of right now. I'm just sitting by the fire, so. Stripe on his head. We should have white from back in the day. 64 pounds of scales. Oh, Vanessa! Close. Something like that. Oh no. Right? Oh, I love him. (whispering) He's very nervous right now. This temple is very... it's lovely. I've never been by. I've never been in, no. (laughs) It's old. How are you feeling, Vax? Okay. And I squeeze her hand. I'll make sure he gets out okay. I promise. Okay. Please be safe. It'll be fine. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. We'll go. We'll go in with you. Do I feel anything, being in here? 23. Okay. Same. Be careful. We'll just hang out, yeah? I run over. You okay? (whispering) I'm just going to stay where he is. Yes? Sometimes. I don't think any of us can fully understand. I think, if we did, then we would be gods. Just one kiss? One little lick? I think so... I mean, it's-- it was very different, but that doesn't mean it's wrong. No. Yeah. (laugh) (laugh) Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Whoa. (gasps) Ohh... What? Grog, that is so scary. (gasps) You're so scary. (roars) Can I try it on? Whoa, it's so heavy. (all but Taliesin laugh) Oh, Grog. 9. I'm okay! (laughing) Grog, get me out of this helmet. As he's holding me up like that I try to stab him with it. Well, he just... Yeah. The head of-- I think that was part of the-- Getting to know his new god. Maybe he had to. I don't know. Yeah. Gunpowder tea. Whoa. TRAVIS AND Would I know anything else? Hold, please. Oh, it was crazy. Where's the sea? Yeah. It's also the sea that I sailed. I know it well. I'm pretty familiar with it. (deep voice) The Shrew. Not a natural 20. Total. Heard many tales of The Shrew. Yeah, the ship lost at sea. All sailors know of The Shrew. There was a storm three hundred years ago. Near an island of glass. And The Shrew just didn't sail on. It was tamed. Good tale, but we'll get there one day. Party on the airship. Good try. Tramp stamp. Yeah. Yeah. Very healthy. Hello, Shaun. (more laughter) (laughs) "Ooh." Save the best for last. Expensive-ass wine. (gasps) Yes! There's magic involved. I know, because I just-- What should I do? I'm just so-- I just said we'll circle back. I think he was fine with it. He just understands that I just-- Isn't that the only way to just treat all things? I guess, I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know. I just feel so confused. He wears you down a little. And there's something there, for him. Oh, I don't know. He's just very charming. MARISHA AND Yes, I know! How? I feel like he goes to sleep and then the next morning he's like-- ASHLEY AND Why is that? Yes! Yes. I know. I just. (groans) I've had feelings for someone for a long time, but maybe they're slowly fading. I don't know. I have. I don't know if I feel comfortable talking about it. But it's fine. (groans) I just. I don't know. It's still something that I need to think about. I'm just. Okay. (laughs) You do look lovely, though, in your dress. Thanks. Ooh. Hello. Oh, you look lovely. Expensive-ass wine. Phew. Maybe we can get one of them on our side. It's very good. Good night, Gilmore. I'm going to pour another glass of wine. Put a pair of Birkenstocks on its branches. Get your posters!
