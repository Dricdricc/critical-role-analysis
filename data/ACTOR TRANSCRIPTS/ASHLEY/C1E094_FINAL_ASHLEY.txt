Hello! Ah! Hello, everybody! Oh, hi! Oh, just so terrible! Hello, everybody! Hi! Hey! Hey! You're just going to walk by? Oh, hi. Oh, hey! Hey! Hi, hello Taryon. Hello. I heard. I imagine it's awful, and I just think I was a little nervous about going there, because I don't know how that would affect me. Just selfishly speaking, I feel like maybe it wouldn't have been good. Maybe? I feel like it would have affected me in certain ways, or, you know, I just don't know! No, it's probably safe that I didn't. You have a little bit of a glow! You ate a soul? What did it taste like? Percy. What do you mean? When in hell-- What is it? I know why. And I think, word on the street is that you completed that mission. I just heard on the street from that guy. He just told me what just happened. It's crazy. (laughter) Perfect timing! Perfect timing. If you guys don't mind, just pick up the rest of the carts, all of it. I haven't seen them in so long. Okay. So much stuff to do and discuss. Whatever. He was just a little bit rude to me, so I don't really mind. It's fine, don't be mad. I just feel like he wasn't very appreciative, and I was working very hard. And you know how strong I am! What I lack in height, I make up for in strength. Let's go drink! Oh. Who was your best-- Oh, no, Tary. With some flirting! Ooh, flirting can take your mind off lots of things. Do you have someone in mind that you're going to flirt with? And maybe just don't go right to "mate," you know, "you're my mate" right from the get-go, because that might freak somebody out. Well, there it is. That's what we're looking for. Ooh! I have an idea. What if we have a contest? Whoever takes her home-- -- or just-- I don't like having a woman be a part of a contest. That sounds terrible. I just mean-- I'm not trying to-- Moral compass! I'm not-- It's still the same thing. Maybe I've become terrible. Win the affections of. Yeah. Okay. Can I be in this contest? I think it's a great idea. Oh no. That's not a good lesson to learn. Oops. How come? Did you like it there? Did you get anything out of it? You met a bear? Did they make friends with Trinket? You've picked up a woman before, but just not in a bar? Wait, what did you say? What did I miss? What? Whoa. Yay. You don't even have to do anything. You can just have an hour of their time. Listen, I do think that going to, as you put it, a house of flesh, is a part of being an adventurer. It's a rite of passage. Well, where do you think I go when you guys leave all the time? (laughter) Say again? Well, those are so fun, too. You could go rescue him. Do they get to know? What did you see? I feel like he's just so romantic, he'll probably stay the night and have breakfast or something. Well, because I am not as tired as you guys-- I have been working so hard, but I'm going to stay. Gonna wait for Tary. Hey, he's my best friend and I love all of him. But it's just like, she's so pretty with like a feather in her hair. I know! And she's really good with money! I know. And then when she got the broom-- With her hair-- She's the best. (blows nose) I know. Ugh. (sighs) Do you know what I do every night? I sometimes-- I sometimes-- -- put in my earring and I have conversations with Scanlan. I know he can't hear. Nobody! I just tell him how the day was and what I did and-- you know. I just say-- I don't-- obviously he's not going to talk back. You should try it sometimes or just see, you know. I know he can't hear. Yeah. (sobs) (laughter) I don't know. I don't know. I felt bad. Once we had the story then I was like. Maybe-- The story of his life. I was like, maybe he shouldn't go with her. I don't know. Because he had-- Maybe we should have found him somebody else. I guess we didn't find them. She just came along. TRAVIS Yeah. I mean, the hunt was on. Yep. You just got to kind of react at that point. Well. I'm tired now. I said earlier I wasn't tired, but I do get tired. I think it just takes so much out of your body to cry. I know. It's like, where does it all come from? There's so much of it. Thanks. I will. He's fine. He's not as dumb as he seems. I know it's just-- but his heart is so-- it's just as big as he is. I will. It will be good as new, right here on the table, folded for you. Night, Shauna. It was so nice to meet you. Thank you so much for everything. My name's Pike. It's very nice to meet you. He talks in his sleep. It'll be fine, don't worry. Well. Scanlan? I know you can't hear, but I'm sitting in a tavern right now with Grog; he just went to sleep. I had a pretty good day. I had to do a lot of labor; just lifting stuff into a cart. And then, you know, Vox Machina, lo and behold, come home and I see them and now we're here. But we miss you. I'm going to-- I'm very tired. (snores) (laughter) I wasn't up yet to fix it. Oh, she's still-- she stayed the whole night. That's a good-- That's a good sign, right? Sorry-- Chicken pot pie. (laughter) Just so thirsty. We just waited just in case. How do you-- it was rough? How do you feel? (laughter) You feel different? Great meal, great company-- Great night. So many curves. Details, details. (laughs) Do we need mimosas? Okay. You know, it just depends on the day, I guess. Okay, you know what? This is what adventurers do, and you did it-- Look at that face. You've seen things. Without a shadow of a doubt, now you know. Let's get back. Did you get to sleep, at all? Do you need sleep? Oh, you were just-- Is that a possibility? She's the coolest. It's okay. I don't mind feeding it. Now. Yeah, I need to see what's going on. That was today? (laughter) What-- Oh! What exactly were we doing? I'm sorry, I've had a night. Oh. No. I'm-- No. I'm saying, I've just been waiting for them anyway. I'm going to stay. Bye! Be safe. (laughter) Come on, come on, come on. Come on! And dies. Boop! Boop him on the nose. We-- all-- here. You look great! That thing looks so heavy! I love you. Me too. How de dur de dur?
