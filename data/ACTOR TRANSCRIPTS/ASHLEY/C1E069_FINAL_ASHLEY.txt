Vex? I'm in the temple. Where are you? I know something's wrong. Okay. I knew something was wrong. Where is he? I'm going to try. Okay, I'm going to cast Resurrection on him. With Raise Dead, is there-- (sighs) what is my question? How whole does he come back? Well, we could save a little money. (laughter) His glasses are broken. We could fix his glasses. Let's do it. He's a de Rolo. He deserves the best. How do I find out what it is? Insight check, or can I-- 21. I'm trying to remember! I think it was Greater Restoration. To the gun? Is that even going to make any sense? I mean, in case this doesn't work-- I continue working on the Resurrection spell. Okay. I don't know. I mean, the love that we have for him? I don't know. (tearfully) This is so stressful. Right. I think, clearly, I would hope that Sarenrae would come in and step in and help in this. I could. Can I use that along with this? Well, heck yes. Okay. I rolled a three. Come on. 18? Yes. That's ten. An extra ten, so what did I say? 28. (sighs with relief) This is too fucking much, man. I don't care. You're welcome. Hi! I've read all of them. Just all of them. I've had lots of time on my hands. Yes! Here we go! All right. (laughs) Four. (laughter) Hey, it was a joke! Trying to make everyone laugh? I'm learning. I give Percy a big hug. Please don't do that again? Not enough? Yes. I know, it still needs some work. It's not very cozy yet, but it's coming around. I give everybody a big hug! With my gauntlets on, so a big bear hug! (growls) (laughs) Hey! (laughter) No. Who is this guy? Oh yeah. Hi, again. Good to see you. He was probably what? I'm going to Detect Evil. Okay. 28! I put my hand on his shoulder and I say Kynan, you look like a man who feels like he's made a mistake, and you just need to turn that frown upside down. (laughter) You're welcome. Of course. That always helps. What is it? That's okay. You don't drink alcohol for the taste. Well, yeah! (laughter) I came to party! Oh boy. Here we go. 15. I feel like it didn't taste any different than what I usually have. Throw me off another one! Oh shit. (laughs) I just rolled a one! (laughter) Well, I thought it-- I don't even know... (garbled speech) (laughter) I got too cocky. Am I still out? I just tried to stealth! Too loud. Oh! Did I do that? I'm sorry, owner. (laughter)
