We had been planning for that episode, I remember talking to Marisha. I was like, I kind of want to boost Taliesin. We were like, everybody knows who Taliesin is. I don't know if I can. Should we take it out? Can I try to grab his hand and slap him across the face? 27. What did it say? If I were to cast Locate Object, would that work? Okay! I think I've located it. I can't see it, but I know what direction it's in. I don't know. So it seems like it's in the ground or it's been moved. Okay, can I start digging? I put it in the box. That's my favorite thing you've ever said. Hold on. I cast Cure Wounds for his eye. Do you want me to hold it? I feel like I'm going to hold onto it in case it tries to attach itself to you again and you pull out your eyeball again. We didn't. How much can you make? Can I take a peek? How will we know it's there? It has to be something small? How do you know if they're there? Did you just point at me and tell me to come to you so you can make me disappear and come back? No, it makes me nervous, Scanlan. I want to keep our... eyes on it. (laughter) Are we down? How's everybody doing? I think am, let's see if I wrote it down here. Oh, yeah! I forgot! I'm almost dead. Okay. Mass Cure Wounds. You all heal 31 points. It's something. Should we try killing an animal and seeing how many diamonds you get out of it? Do you want to Speak with Dead before bed, or do you want to sleep on it? No, I feel like you're going to make plans. What happened? I'll take it. 19. I'm going to try to hop up and hide in the tree. I guess I'm looking awake in the tree. I'm going to keep watching. I run down from the tree. I don't want him to see me. Oh. 22. Stringbean? Hi. We're in the Feywild. Where did you just come from? I did know that. We're trying to figure out how to save you. I don't know. That's okay. Vax? Can I put my hand on his chest and see if I feel a heartbeat? Do I feel a heartbeat? That's a natural 20. I see them all the time. Okay. I can't figure it out. Sometimes when people are very athletic, they have very slow heart rates. You're very in shape. I'm going to climb up the tree and wake up Keyleth. Come down from the tree real quick. Everything's okay. I grab her hand. It's okay. Come with me. Vax is at the bottom of the tree. He has a heartbeat. Vax, what do you like to do with my hair? Do you remember anything from when you woke up? I know, but what if it does something-- Vax? I don't, either. You have something new on your chest. Keyleth? I climb back up the tree. Are you okay? I was watching, and then I saw him walk out of the tree of sorts, and I think it's him, and he's obviously naked. Okay. Maybe you would be able to tell, to see what's going on. I think you should come down. It will be okay. Okay. Okay. Vax, you're going to be okay. Take my hand. This is going to be okay. We're going to figure this out. Grog. Keep it just in case. I'm going to cast Turn Undead. Vax, I don't know how you did it, or how she did it, but something's happened. I've never seen anything like this before in my life. You're there, and you're here. What did you say? What was your deal? Or maybe you're free from that deal? I can ask. That doesn't mean we're going to get it. What do you mean? You have a very different connection with your god. 19. Shit, what was I going to say? What if I were to channel divinity and try to make a prayer and be like, hey, can we come up there right quick? I don't know. I like this idea. It's a little crazy, but I like it. We'll work our way through in a montage. A god-tage. I have advantage because of gnome cunning? 14. Can I Greater Restoration them? I don't know how you did it before because I don't think I was here. We were in the Feywild for a little while, and then took a nap there, and then we came here. I'll go over and touch Grog, too. She gave you a Vecna compass. Stop off, go to wine country. To Sarenrae? That's okay. I'm heavier than I look. Pure muscle. It looks lovely in here. You guys have really kept it up quite nice. Not all by myself. Yeah! That's a compliment. (laughter) Sheila. (sighs) We're trying to figure out the best way to... what am I trying to say, here? We're trying to go to Sarenrae, but actually go to her. Not in the sense of the mind, actually walking up and saying hello. When I started, I realized this is so weird. Okay. I could try. Of course, but maybe he will know which plane she's on and we can head there. Sometimes she doesn't talk to me. I can always try, since we're in here. I'll go ahead and try. You know what? Let me say a prayer real quick, Sheila. Percy, it's fine. You don't need to. Let's all take a knee. Well, I'm back here, and this is so beautiful. I'm sure you've seen and have... seen what's happened where we were, and I know the last time we talked, you warned me and told me that you wouldn't be there, but I think we're past the point of being able to do this on our own, just our mortal selves, and we need bigger help. Might I ask for (sighs) your-- please help us. I don't know what else to say. This is beyond us now. I immediately take a knee. Thank you for letting me come here. Just to see you, and-- we will come to you. Did you guys see anything? Wow! Well, I went there. I went to the Island of Renewal; that's where she is. And she gave this to me. Over the earring. Shut up, Scanlan. No, it's not. That was cool. Vax, you have a very different relationship with your god, but-- awesome! That was cool! She was so beautiful! And just glowed. No! And I just can't even describe it, she just glowed and it felt like-- do you remember the movie Contact? (laughter) Yes, the old scroll Contact, where she gets to the beach and her dad is there? That's what it felt like! I need to go back there! Let's all go! 23. I didn't think it was going to work! Sheila, I think-- It's wonderful to see you, Vincent. I'm so sorry she went to go get you. I think we might be okay, and we got some answers. You, obviously, have heard of Vecna. So basically, we're going to need a lot of help, and please stay in prayer. I don't feel like I want to. Hopefully we will. Please pray for us. Thank you. Keep up the good work. You're doing, just, all the great stuff. It happened so fast. Kaitiaki. (whispering) This is the Astral Sea. This is so beautiful. I know. That is crazy!
