Wait! Who did they cast as Ms. Marvel? (gasps) Really? Forgot about that. (laughter) Oh, I want to give a shoutout. There's this place that pretty close to where I live called The Brooklyn Strategist. Yeah, and when Laura and Travis came to visit-- It's basically a gaming shop and you can play D&D there on Wednesday nights and Saturdays. And play board games. It's also a coffee shop. It's rad. It was delicious. The Brooklyn Strategist. Check it out if you're in New York or Brooklyn. Yeah, let me do some healing. I don't know where I'm at. One 6th and one 5th? Okay. All right, and then healthwise, where am I at? Went down 66? Okay guys, let's do a Mass Cure Wounds then at fourth level. Yeah. A Mass Cure Wounds, sorry. How low is everybody? Short rest. Yeah, let me go ahead and do it. 18. That's plus five. Rolled a little low. Yeah. Somewhere around there. Three! I can do some cleanup. (laughter) Matt, real quick. Oh, I think I do have a sixth level because I think that sixth level was used for Liam with the worm, and then we came back to the keep to rest. Come on, guys. All right, I'm-- Can I run over to where Trinket is? Okay. I'm going to Cure Wounds on him. Okay, I'm going to cast it at 4th-level. Dang! 30. I want to scratch behind his ears. Okay, you guys are my eyes, so I can't really see it from here. But I guess anywhere there's cover. Is that a tree? What was that? Yeah! I don't know. (singing) Critical bite! Okay, okay, okay. I am at, hold on-- Hold on, one second. Okay, I'm at 25. Could be worse, could be worse. I'm trying, I'm trying. Ah! Natural 20. I don't have any dexterity modifier. No, no, no. No, no, no, grab me and let's go. Grog! Can I go into the temple? I would like to go over to a quiet spot in the temple and start saying a prayer. And I'd like to cast Planar Ally. You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. So I would like to call on Sarenrae. It's a 6th-level. You have to ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment. Well I think if I say-- Sarenrae, I've been rebuilding your temple for months, so please help us in battle and help rebuild our city, if that's service enough. Okay. We need your help. As you can see, our city has fallen to pieces by these dragons that are attacking us. And we ask that you aid us in battle somehow. Okay. Ah, shit. Okay. Okay, well, yes. Rebuild our keep. Can I try opening it? Can we wiggle in? What's going on? Can I push the door open? Or at least try? Yeah, go first, go first. I want to try and push in the door open. With all my strength. Eight. Grog! Let me in! I've been waiting five minutes! (laughter) No, Dimension Door me in, please. Yeah, the door flies open. What is going on in here?! Can I insight-check Grog? 21. I want to know why he wants this skull so bad. Yep. Can I walk over and grab Craven Edge? Grog, can you give me Craven Edge, please? I just want to look at it. I just want to see, something's not quite right. Grog, did you just say you want to protect the skull? Okay, what were you trying to do when you brought Percy and Vex up here? To do what? But you want the wish? There has to be some type of payment, if we take a wish. Can we play longer?
