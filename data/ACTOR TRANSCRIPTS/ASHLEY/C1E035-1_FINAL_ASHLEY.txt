I thought it was funny. Yeah. Oh man, I can't wait to get mine! (laughter) (laughs) I don't know. I didn't have a comeback for that one. I'm back! We were killing Lady Briarwood? Okay. Can I heal somebody? How's everybody else? Yeah! Okay. Let me do a Mass Cure Wounds. I have that. Yes. I know, I have you guys on my iPad down here, but you're delayed. Okay, so I'll cure all the six people in my family. 26! 17. Jeez. Yeah, I'm pretty low on spells, guys, but we're going to be okay. Eight! Ain't no hollaback gnome! What do I roll for that, again? 17? Okay. Is Guiding Bolt considered the same thing that Lightning Bolt would be? Okay. Okay, I'll hold my action. Yeah. I think I'll stay. I can't see where I'm at, but I think I'll just stay. Can I do something? Yeah, I'm going to go up to Percy and cast Protection from Evil on him. Which... 22.

Yeah, I'll move away from it. Wait, hold on a minute. I should probably take a potion or something. I'm pretty low. Nope. It's okay. I'm going to take a-- what do I have in here? It just says I have a healing potion. God, I don't know what that means. Well, I don't have enough-- I don't think I have enough left. I want to save them. Okay. Two. Six. Okay, eight. I'll stay. "Thanks!" I blow him a smoke kiss. You've got to do what you've got to do. 22. Oh no. I put my hand out and touch his nose and tell him it's okay. LAURA and 16. Kill him. Wait, did you kill him? Oh, yes! Wait, but doesn't he have protection?
