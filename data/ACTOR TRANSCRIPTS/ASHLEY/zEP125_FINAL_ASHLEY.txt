Yeah. I love that color! Let's have cruises soon. I was going to say it, but I thought it was-- I'm out of practice! I'll get better at it again. Give me a minute. He shows up to you as a man? Or how does that work? Okay. I mean, I certainly don't see him in the flesh, so no. Yes, of course. Not exactly. That's a good idea, actually. That's a good idea. Should we get you a rag as well? Just to have on hand like a hanky. So you don't have to do a full bath, you could just do a quick-- I'm definitely not bothered. If you're renting a room there, maybe they have to let us in. I have a tinder box too. I have a torch! Are you going to take your ears and roll them? Do you know how they were killed? Did anybody see any wounds? They never recovered the body. I go. I'll take out my torch. I'll light my torch once I get down there. I look around. (yells back) Everything looks good! Oh. (laughter) I forgot how to play D&D! Everything looks good! (screams) Uh-oh! Eight! Like I said, everything looks good! Yeah, come on down, Nott. We can wait until everybody gets down. I keep looking. Keeping watch. Listening. We won't die. Well, I feel like if you were a monster, you would go-- No! Any tracks of any sort? 13. In the area where we're at, the only exit now goes up another rung to the outside? Can I touch a little bit of the webbing with the flame? I love that we're fighting rats right now. 17. Oh shit. No, I know. I'm one to talk. Oh no. Eight. Shit. MARISHA and Yeah. Wait, is this a dog next to Caleb, what is this? Okay, I think-- I think she's got this, so-- I don't want anything to happen to Caleb. Can I get to any of the ones over by him? Okay, so I'll move over to one of those. Let's go to the one closest to him. I'm going to-- Wait, so slashing-- so bludgeoning keeps it from-- I'm going to rear back and punch it. 23. Unarmed strike, yeah. One, plus your strength modifier. Do I get-- I don't because I moved-- do I get a bonus action? (mumbling) Still trying to figure this out. Can I just touch it? Set it aflame? I move my cloak to-- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I have resistance to piercing. Oh, you have to be raging? Okay, got it. Got it, okay. 19. I mean, I'm 19 out of 32. I'll take it. 19. That's your max?! Well, it's good I took the hits, you know? Are you very scared? Just right now? I don't think that that was the monster. I don't understand why those rats were-- (chuckling) Yes. Nein! Yeah, maybe we should be sneaky. I rolled shit for stealth, so it wouldn't do me any good. Oh. Should I take up the rear? 15? What if we (blows air)? Is it close enough to us? Are we able to get to this lump? Or do we have to go through some of the web? Maybe we can look at it up closer? Yeah, that's probably true. The thing is, if we kill them, I mean, we're putting them out of their misery. You know. Yeah, they're probably already-- I think if they start moving, this thing's going to-- But then we'll get eyes on it. Oh, that's what that means. Yeah, I'll follow as far back as I can. How close am I to one of the human form ones? I mean this is the firestarter over here. Caleb, do you want to stand behind me and little peeksies from behind? Yeah. I'll help. Are we moving forward or we're still--? Can I poke around with the tip of my sword and see if there's any money or something in their pockets? 18. I'll take them. How close are we to those now? Or it's behind us and waiting until we get in its room. You went to no's like, "No no no." Wait, so it's behind? Was it on the ceiling the whole time? Are they invisible, the people that are on the walls? Eight! Oh, seven, I'm sorry. So do I. Well, he's not invisible anymore. Okay, can I get to it? 30 feet. Okay, so. Um-- I would like to rage. (cheering) Yeah. Rage, take out my sword and try to hit it between the eyes. Okay. Okay. 23. What do I roll?! 2d6 plus three. (grunting) Plus five to whatever I roll? Okay, 14. Yeah, because I can't do anything else, right? Okay, I stand there at the ready with the point. Does it sparkle? It's got all sparkly little-- He's looking rough. That hits. Halved. Okay. Natural 20. 11 in addition to the-- Did it bamf? Oh, shit. Okay, it's gone, so we don't know where it is? We don't see it. Okay. I feel like we should get closer. I'm going to move over to Fjord. Yeah, back against the wall. (mimics the music) I think that's-- oh, can I do Healing Hands on myself? Okay, I'll do Healing Hands on myself. Well, I think it's because I'm-- TALIESIN and Yes. Healing Hands. Come on. Mock him. I go up and I give Molly a slap on the ass. It's good. That was fun. Whisper? How much money was in the first two purses? Okay. It's true. Wait, was was it? Is the Broken Howl on there? That looks like a piece of shit ship. (laughter) We got it, yeah. I really hide the money that I found. Yeah. Are we the strongest? Oh! (laughter) Cloyne? She has a room there. Stick it to the man. Bathhouse? Kill them. I'm kidding. Nobody wants to stay? (laughter) I quite like it here. I do like these people a lot. Can we do it just us at home?
