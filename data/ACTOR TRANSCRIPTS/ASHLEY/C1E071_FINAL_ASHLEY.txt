Hello! Oh hi! Okay. Yeah. Here we go. (laughter) Hey! I was just about to go to bed! I was just saying my prayers. I do it as much as I can. (stammers) I know. I'm so glad I wasn't. I'm so glad you're here. I missed you. I was thinking today and I was like, "Oh man, I should've just gone with them." I know. It's okay. Or I will be there now. Let's go. Let's do it. I had to go buy some because I left all of my stuff in New York. Let's see how this goes. No, I got those a little earlier. We're okay. We're here. Okay. Okay, great. Hey, guys. (laughter) I don't think I can get worse than that; that is a one. SAM and Off to a great start. I'm going to not move. We should run. We should run because it's probably coming down! Wait, what did you say it is? TRAVIS and Wait, I get nothing, okay. A four. Aw, come on! What is that noise? Hey! Hey! So whatever that was just saw us disappear. What is that? LAURA and I slam it shut with my gauntlets. We don't know what that was! Well, maybe you do, but I don't know. It's a dragon! Well, that was an accident. I was going to surprise you guys. And we almost died. You could bring it down there. I am! (laughter) No, I was kidding. How can you be loud as mist? Eight. It's so pretty! Did you make the-- I'll do it! Oh, okay. You'll know your mansion better. 21. Away from them, too? So you guys are fine. I try to make wide eyes. We should take his loot. That's amazing! We came back for you because he's going to build a mansion somewhere else. To hold some stuff? She's the coolest. She was doing one-handed push-ups and eating chicken in the other. Yeah. Yeah. (laughter) I understand. You're also carrying a mansion or something. Magic weighs a lot. I'm going to talk to him in Dwarvish, and I'm going to ask where he's from. Here I am. No, she told me. I am. I got nine, so that brings me to 97. Yeah, I'm going to stay in the house for a little bit. I'm staying inside the mansion for right now. We're going to die! That's a biggie. Kill him. One turn. We can't leave them out there alone. Right? Are we going to leave them out there to die? Five. There it is. No mercy Percy! How much, again? Yikes. Well. Are we outside the mansion? Scanlan vanished. I'm going to pop out. Maybe I can stay in there and do this, in the door, and try to cast Divine Intervention. A ten? Oh boy! Yes! It worked! For a bonus action, I would like to place a spiritual weapon at the back of his neck, since he's on the ground. And I would like it to be a very large flaming sword. 25. Okay, well, six. Sarenrae did the damage. Sarenrae does 50 points of damage, and I do six. That's fine. (laughter) I'm going to stay behind. 1d8 plus your spellcasting modifier? Spell attack bonus. I understand. Does the spiritual weapon get an attack of opportunity? Nine. Divided between us all, right? (laughter) Just 72? All right. It's been a week, right? One week is one round, right? Okay. So what I'd like to do... Here's a question. Flame Strike, since it comes from the sky, would it work since he's up in the sky? Comes from above. All right, let's give it a try. 18. 19. Oh! (giggles) Do I add anything else? What is it? 29. I'm going to stay put. And for bonus action, I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself. Little pinch. Get him. I am at 13. Well, I'm going to run away. I'll be fine. You're at four, Scanlan. I'm threatening him. Yeah, that hits. I'm out. I'll take that hit point. Okay. I don't even know what that means. I didn't do anything. I'm at one. Can I do War God's Blessing from where I'm at? 11.
