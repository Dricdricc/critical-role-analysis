Okay, 21 points. Okay. How close can I get to the hole? Okay. So I’m going to go to there. And then I’m going to create a Spiritual Weapon. Can I send it down to the rakshasa? I don’t know where the rakshasa is. Okay, so you know what? Can I nix that? I’m going to cast Shield of Faith on myself. So that will bring me up to - because I’m 13 right now with the shield? Dang. Wait, are all the assassins gone now? And you just killed one. Or two. Okay. Don’t you leave! Vox Monica. Vox Phoebe. Vox Ross. Vox Chandler. Look away. (sings) We’ve only just begun.

(all laugh) I’m mad. My non-hairy skin. (all laugh) Thanks, Grog! I think that’s what it is! I hold my shield over my body. So he comes back? Can I check the robe? Can I take a look at the robe? Can I try to rip it off of him? Wait, but - Gilmore gave you the robe? I’d like to follow. Yes. A little tutu. Ellipses. I put out my hand and say, "I've heard a lot about you. It's nice to meet you." I have a robe! I have on a robe! I'm dressed! I'm dressed! A deep V? I'm dressed like this all the time. Good plan. Yeah. Do they get any stronger when they come back, or are they always the same? Can I go over to the dead body that Kima threw into the middle of the room and cast Speak With Dead? Five questions. Who sent you? Hotis. What was - LAURA, LIAM, AND Hotis hired us. What is your organization? Three more questions. How did Hotis know to find us here? How many of you were there? Who his boss was? Who gives you your orders? Within The Clasp? I have one job - LAURA AND Yes. Yikes. If we destroy it, though, would that hurt Vax? (laughs) You dick. (gasps) What? I can also heal you. You didn't perception check the cup! What's he looking up? (dryly) Wow, I've never heard of that. (whispering) What the fuck? Can I wake up and come out into the hallway? What are you guys looking for? Can I check him? Yeah. 23. Move aside, move aside, move aside. No poison? Medicine check. I'll do it. I'll do it. We could try. Yeah, he was cursed. No, Grog. As much as you can. Can you ask for some ale? Ale? I drink some and then pass it over. Hair of the wolf. Ah! Oh. Percy, can I touch him? Can I put my hand out to him? Yeah. Oh! (laughs) I go, "Ohhh." (all laugh) I would be glad to help. It's okay. I can come back to you guys at any time. Well, I don't know. Any time you need me. (laughs) Ish. I will try to be there. A sending stone? Oh. Okay. I'll keep this with me. Okay. Okay, I will, Grog. I'm a monster! You're welcome. No, it's not. No. And maybe I'll meet you very soon. I'll just help out where I can. We got him once. I can get him again. (laughs) I'm a monster. Yeah. Of course. We plan at dawn? They learned. Okay. I feel confused... all the time. Yes! I think that's just what life is. Yeah. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. I feel like maybe I just look that way, because I don't feel like I have much of anything together, or know where I'm going. Yeah. No. It's an interesting thing. I think... She just helps when we need her, or when I need her, and I think for the rest of the time, She just - - does her own thing. It was interesting going to the Temple of the Raven Queen. She seems... very interesting to me. I don't know. She's just very involved. But maybe that's - maybe that's because Vax has fully given himself to Her. (hesitantly) I think I try to, but there's always that little part of me that thinks... or has doubt? So I don't know. Yeah. I think that's a very good way to handle it. Yeah. Yes, there are two confused souls in the world. I'm sure there are so many more. Yeah. (laughs) Hugs. I think we will. I think you should. And I think... you should get comfortable with Vax. I think he really fancies you. But don't be scared. Just know that things are not forever... And just have fun, you know? Well, you should. We all need a little fun. (chuckles) Well, I'll see you very soon. Okay. I love you. Oh. Oh, he just - Yeah, we thought he was an assassin. See if he has a Choco Taco or - Love you, Kiki! I know. Maybe it won't be for long, but I think I should stay. I know. I know. I did not forget. Yes. I have been thinking about it so much. I'm proud of you! It was the hairy shoulders, wasn't it. (all laugh) That's okay, Scanlan. It's okay. These things happen. And maybe it wasn't the best time, and maybe someday in the future, we can just reconnoiter and see if we want to make a - just talk about it again, I guess. We'll be friends. Oh, I - okay. (all laugh) That's very true. (sighs) Well, maybe - (all laugh) But you are very charming. I just wanted to tell you that. Okay, okay. (extended laughter) Nothing. Off the table. Nothing. (others continue to laugh) It's really okay. (laughs) All right. Just a friend hug. It's okay! It's okay! We'll talk later. Can I - I'll just say bye to the rest of the group. It's okay. Maybe we'll see you very soon. Wait, are we going already or do we have the night? Sorry, I just wanted to give you a hug. Yeah, because you're one of my best friends and I needed to give you a hug. I may be here next week. Let's go get shitfaced. Come on! Oh, Vex, that hat is amazing! I think it looks amazing. (laughs) Oh my god. Percy! (laughing) Oh, yes. (gasps) That's amazing. A little extra cooked. Thanks, Vaxy. Well... Or flying in my footsteps, rather. Because that's pretty cool. I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you guys very much. But maybe I'll see you more often? Okay. (sighs) Okay. And I'll just be there when I can. Okay. Yeah? That big asshole. Yes. (laughs) Hi, Vex. (sighs) I'm going to miss you guys a lot. Cheers. (drinking noises) All right. All right. Bye, Vax. Hi. Me? How?! Impressing me? You know, I'm just rubbish. I'm just all the time rubbish. (laughs) Okay. Oh, Percy. I will make sure to visit all of these places and read all these things. Well - oh. I have something for you. When we went to my house, or, well, where I lived with Wilhand... I got something from underneath the bed, and - (laughs) Yes, it's lacy panties. (all laugh) This is something that's been in my family for a really long time, and I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I need to give it to you. So come closer to me real quick. It's a necklace. And just... don't take it off. And it will keep you safe. You're welcome. I will. And keep them safe, and keep yourself safe, please? Cheers. Same. I give Grog a big hug and say, Please be safe. Yeah, we're the original O.G. Yeah. Original Original G. Oo-G. Oog. (laughs) Oh. Well, that offer is off the table. Oh. It's not happening anymore. So, yeah, he's free to have some good times at the old "lady houses" that you guys like to visit. The lady spas? (all laugh) Whorehouses? (all laugh) You know what? I think he's not quite ready. I think it was just the idea of it. The idea of me. Because I'm just really great. Yeah. Yeah, he did. It happens. Oh. I have my eye on one already. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's fine. Okay. Yeah. Well. Just be careful. Keep yourself safe. Yeah! Well, just don't make too crazy of decisions. Yeah? Okay. (doosh doosh doosh doosh doosh) Oh. Ohh. Okay. I hope so. All right. Yeah, will you - yeah. Okay. (all laugh) I put my shoulders back and do the same thing she does. And turn around and wave. Bye. VEX AND Bye, Vaxy. I'm not here. Oh. Boo. Loot Crate! Okay, wait, hold on a second. Guys, for those of you in the Critter community who made this amazing quilt. This is going to come with me and be on my bed, and I'll snuggle it. I love this so much. Yes. It has all the art on it - People wrote on Twitter Never stop being yourself. You empower others to be themselves - oh, okay, now I'm just reading, like - (all laugh) Your hair's great! I love it. Oh, goodness. I'm going to miss you guys so much. What's he say, again? Okay. All right. All right. When I can, Skype in. Astral projection Pike. (laughs) Oh, I'll be really there. That's right. That's right. Yes. We're going to make it work. Matt will have to make it - It's a Pike in a box! MATT, MARISHA, TALIESIN, AND
