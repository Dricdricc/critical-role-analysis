We love our druid! Lookit! Look at what it says. (sings) I love it so much. Well, I would like to make a proposition, if everybody would like to take a rest, I know I'm pretty rough right now and maybe we could go see if my great-great grandfather is okay. Yeah. Who-- how-- where is-- Yes. It's close. Yes. Can I check the door, if it's locked? That's a good thing. He's fine, just nothing even happened. You can try. 20. I go over to Theodore and-- I don't think I have to bend down. I had a little wooden doll, and so I'm going to pass it to him and say, in case we never see you again, you can always think of us when you play with this. That's for you. And you can name him whatever you want. Pike. Theodore! Follow me, please. That's a good sign. I think that's a good sign. Yeah. Pop-Pop Wilhand? It's Pike! A little, he could-- a little. Vax? Would you mind? Maybe you'll get some luck with this door. Wait, hold on, I forgot that somewhere in this armor-- All that clanking is actually this key moving about my armor. All right. I go to the crack. Pop-Pop Wilhand! It's Pike! He's very strong. Okay. I step in and start looking around. Can I check the bedroom? There are hiding places. Okay, I go running down. I just pull them off. Pop-Pop Wilhand! I give him a big hug. I missed you so much, I'm so glad you're okay. Long story, we'll get there. Yeah. There was a very big battle. And Grog beat Kevdak. Chopped him in half! Straight down the middle. Filleted him. So everything's a little bit more under control, hopefully. Mm. Ish. Hey, guess what though? We've fought many dragons already. And guess what, I killed one! Two or three. It's okay right now. All right. I drink the whole rest of the bottle. It's a little stronger than I remember it. Oh no. Would you all-- there's plenty more, would you all like to join me and have a sip? I think we should make a meal. He's a very good cook. He does. He does have a mansion. It's a magic mansion. At dawn, we plan! We'll fix it. Davin was my neighbor. He's my great-grandfather. So we can put him in the mansion? All right. I kiss him on his forehead and say it's going to be okay. Go in there, take a nap, and show them how to cook. (whispers) What? We'll talk about it later. What? Oh, I've been there! You can go stay-- I have my own room. You can go stay in my room. Hey Scanlan, how will he know which room is my room? It's very big. Roll for initiative. I would like to go check my room out and see how it is. See if it's okay, any damage. Right. I wanted to grab something under the bed. I'm going to take it and I'm going to hide it. But if everybody is out of the town, and it's empty, then won't the dragon know? And then won't he leave? How much time are you thinking? I could throw up a Blade Barrier on top of him. Should we check it for traps first? (fart noise) Raaaah! Goosh. Yeah, I have Dispel Magic. Yeah. All right. 18. I think it's dispelled? Thanks, Vax. Yeah, it's really pretty, but lemme give it a try. Let's leave it, it's so pretty! I mean, that key was hidden for a reason. I might need some extra help because I only got a ten. Make him wave! Keyleth, that's awesome! Pop-Pop? Pop-Pop could do it, but I don't know if he would be very-- I couldn't possibly use my Glove of Storing, could I? To hold his hand? All right. You've attuned to them. Yup. I want to train, too. Sit-ups. Are we learning skills? Group workout? I call him Fluffy. It's-- you're in slow-mo! You sneaky-sneaky. As you take it off your head-- These are cool! You don't? You don't even feel that? Wow! Did it say anything to you? Okay, this is good, this is good, this is an improvement from your last weapon. Bad? Yeah. Where'd it go, where'd it go, it was right-- Can I-- Can I perception check it? Insight check it, can I-- I'll learn that spell and I'll check it later. I can't tell anything right now. It looks pretty normal. And it's a good sign that it's not talking to you. Yeah. And they look really cool. Whoa! Whoa, and you just did it with the hands. Can I swing the axe? No! At the dummy. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try swinging the axe at the dummy. What's that? My strength? 19. I didn't, I don't think I erased that. I want to be a monstah! (laughter) Yeah! At dawn, we plan. That's me. I'm having trouble. What are you thinking? That was so sudden! Can I roll stealth and hide right now? That was a segue if I've ever heard one. I will definitely have to think about it. Because that's a lot-- You know what, I will think on it, and I will give you an answer after some dragons are killed and-- let me think on it, Scanlan. Let me think on it. I think I was really start-- yeah. It's okay. It's okay, maybe you just feel that way because we could all die, so. You feel like you maybe-- I don't know. We'll table it. Okay. Where is Wilhand? He's probably made a delicious meal. It's all-- if he had more stuff, he could really do well. I go get a blanket and cover him. Oh, buddy. As we're walking to sleep, I grab Scanlan real quick. I grabbed Scanlan real quick once everybody's-- So, I have to tell you something. It's not an answer for that. It's just that-- it's fine. It's okay. I have to confess something to you. When you gave me that letter-- When you told me not to read it until you died-- I read it immediately after you left. Because curiosity gets the best of me sometimes, I can't-- it's not-- I know, but that-- what does that even mean? I go back and forth with it. I know, but what-- I know, it was very personal, and I just wanted to tell you that everything you said in that letter, I promise to you. That I give you my word that everything you said in that letter I promise to you I will do. If you die. (laughter) I know, and we've had so many close calls and I feel like I just needed to tell you so you had some comfort in your person, in your body, that you knew that if-- I know, you do make me a little nervous and I'm not really sure why, and I need to reconcile these feelings. Well, I don't know! I'm so confused. Maybe we should just sleep together and see what happens. I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding, it was just a joke. I know. I'm being careless, I think that drink that Wilhand gave me is settling, and it's-- moving about. Making me say things. I'm just kidding. I don't actually think we should sleep together. I just need to tell you that I-- Anyway, Scanlan, I love you. Well, you've grown those forearms for a reason, so just go take care of business. I did. Yes, I am taking that vow. Okay. And I was trying to be funny and I didn't mean to be careless with your feelings. I do love you so much. And a part of my heart does-- I do love somebody else very much. But my feelings are growing for you a little bit in a weird way and I'm not sure what it is, but we'll figure it out. I'm confused. But I never told you I did not read it! Which is-- what's your picture? Okay. Well, I love you. I give him a hug and a kiss on his cheek. May I say something? I realize you want to go and protect your people, but even if you run, you guys will eventually come across a dragon that will kill all of your people. So what if we fight together? Because there's strength in numbers. Yeah, but I have Gnome Cunning-- charisma-- So I have advantage on charismas. I do! Gnome Cunning-- Advantage on all intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. Oh yes, I didn't read the rest of it. All right, so persuasion? Little persuashe? All right, that's a 20. Fuck. Nine? Hah, he laughs. We've already killed dragons. I pull out my necklace with the tooth on it. I spit at his feet. As Ivon starts going out, I want to trip him. Stick my foot out. It'll probably fail. 12. Sorry, I'm so small. You probably just didn't see me. (laughter) Dick. At dawn, we plan.
