Whoa! I'm a monstah! (cheering and chanting "Monster") I'm back. I swear it's me! That was a little fast, I think. Okay. What was that? Who were you? Yes. I really love that piece that you did. You're so welcome. That's okay. Could we fly? You can. That was such a busy desktop. That was so fun. I got you, buddy. Oh wait. Hold on. Where did it go? I'm sorry, I forgot how to play. 18? Yes! (cheering) Oh, it's the same. Or is that this way? 15? Yes. I originally rolled a two. We can attach the rope to the Immovable Rod. Just put it in the ground. What if we made a boat and then floated down the river? That sounds like a terrible idea, by the look of his face. Wait. If we Dimension Door, what if you turn into an animal to fly, and then you have a broom, and someone can ride on your broom? Hand in hand. No! I sure do! I sure can! The swirley-whirley. (laughter) We are doing so great! Making a comeback! Let's eat it. I don't know. But I did roll shit initiative, as usual. I rolled a big fat six. That's exactly what was happening. No! Come on, Percy! Okay! How far are we from the disgusting thing? 40 feet? Great. So I'm going to get a little bit closer. I'm going to use my trusty old friend Guiding Bolt. I'm going to Guiding Bolt his face. And I'm going to do it at 5th-level, because my best friend is in his belly! I know. Roll a d20? Oh no. That's terrible. 15? 24. Yes. She turns back time. Okay. How is the monster crocodile plant doing? Is he looking rough? Is he regenerating himself? That's bullshit. You know what? I'm going to hold off on that then. No, you know what? I'm going to Flame Strike him. Just the old Flame Strike. Just on his whole body. Oh, where do I want to see it? Maybe his torso area. 18. 28. How's everybody doing? You're a little iffy? Yeah, I want to Healing Word Percy. 60 feet. Okay. All right, so I'll heal him. Yeah. 19. Oh, isn't it my spellcasting modifier? Okay, so then it would be 13, because I rolled two fours. Come on, you should get over here! No rush, but. I'll go. I'm going to get in a ball. She's laughing. That was awesome! I clap from however far away I am. Thanks! I didn't know how I was going to get down. Hey! There goes our IHOP sponsorship. Do you want front or back? Okay. Oh! I did. I rolled a 30. I'm so quiet! Do you want me to stay with you on the broom? Maybe we can land there, and then we can send the broom back to you. I'm not that charming. Scanlan, I'm a little nervous about these ropes. What if they're trying to catch us or something? Wait. Okay. I think I just have so much mud in my eye I don't see anything. Guys? Guys! What do you want to do, Scanlan? (hacking spit) Oh no. (laughter) Okay. That's okay. I pick up the broom before we go invisible. What? We're invisible and the broom is invisible? I go up to Vex and I give her her broom. There's a woman. It looked like it was really nice, and then there was this really cute tea set, and then this crazy hand came out. She looks really scary. The chair was really big. I mean, anybody's tall to us. Yeah, she was very large. I think probably. Oh my god.
