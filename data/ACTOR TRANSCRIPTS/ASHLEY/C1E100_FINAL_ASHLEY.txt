It feels like it was-- like it's a one-of-a-kind watercolor. Like that's what it-- up close, it's crazy. Sorry. I love it so much. Wow, so light, and I would know, I'm a cleric. Er, what? What if we save them forever? Do you at least have a late flight? You never went to brothels or anything like that then, I guess. Did you have a good year together? Sort of, I guess. That was the last time we saw you. Have things been good? Just in case you decide to leave again, which is probably highly probable. I don't know. Just in case. I'm sure you look beautiful. But that's blowing a 7th-level spell. How long does it take to hike up there? What happened, what happened, what happened? Yes, yes. She got hurt! No, you'll be coming. Body pillow. That's a good idea. You're just going to go in there, Scanlan? How are you going to do this? How do you know? Well, I'm not going with you! Wait, I'll go with him. I'm going to go with you. I'm keeping my eye on him. Investigation, did you say? I'm sure he found something. 11. No. Well. Yeah. Let's go back. No. No, don't push your luck. None that we could see. Did you, Scanlan? You should've seen something. Did you look? Well, I was just making sure you weren't going to run away, so I was preoccupied. Should we just go in? I don't think so. And then I think we also put one on the top of the loot for the dragon? Yeah, I don't think it alerts anybody. 30! That's never going to happen again. I tug on Vax's shirt just to let him know I'm there. I say we keep going. If it's an emergency, we can all jump into the mansion, maybe. Is everybody okay to keep going? You sneaky. 22. Coming right up. I'm here. Did you save any for me? I take out my mace and get ready. A Glyph of Warding? Yes, we can. Ooh. Chod! Huh. Are we close to the faces at all, still? On the way back? Great. I throw up a Glyph of Warding right there. A gift for someone. Give me just one second. I don't know if it slipped underneath. You know what? We don't have time, so maybe we can just hop into the mansion. There's also the spa, right? So, basically, it's one of those meals that you're still hungry when you eat it all. Do we have any chalices in here? Yeah, that's fine. I'll volunteer. Undead is my favored terrain. I could. But what's the point? If we find your friends, I can talk to them if they're dead. That's not a bad idea. Same, it's okay. I feel starving. Can you have eggs, or is that not vegan? Well, I'm fine. I'm just finding myself a little angry. And I'm trying not to be. I know. I don't like it. But I can't help it. What should I do? Yeah. I think it's just because I didn't really know them. Maybe it was easier to just let them go, and I wasn't as angry as I am with him. No. I'm just nervous. I know what she'll say, and have me do, and I just want to be-- I don't want to do it! I just want to be mad for a while, I guess, but... I don't know. I guess just seeing him again. Slowly but surely, I'm not as mad, but-- I know, I just feel like now I'm acting like I'm mad, almost, around him. I don't know. He's making me feel so many different kinds of emotions. I'm confused. Okay. That's a good idea. I would feel very bad if something happened to him and I didn't say anything. I mean, if I died, then I just wouldn't know, I guess. It's fine, I don't care. Okay. Well, that's true. Thank you. I know. It is hard. Well, good night. Okay. Well, good night, you two. I go and I knock on Grog's door. Oh, that's right. I stand next to him and stare at Chod-- Lionel in the sand pit. Grog, I know that you probably feel replaced, but there's no way he could fill your shoes. He could-- I mean, but his feet are a little bit too big, you know. Your feet are just right. I have an idea. How about we go get a bunch of blankets, the ones out of my room. We'll just make a fort by the fireplace. We'll make a better spot. I just talked to Vex, and she said that maybe if something were to happen tomorrow, maybe it would be better to just say some things, so that you're not, you know, thinking about it if somebody dies. No. I'll be fine, I promise. Just, I guess, Scanlan. Maybe, do you feel like you want to talk to him? I think I'm angry with him, but I can tell you're also angry with him. So I'll stay mad at him as long as you are. But I feel like maybe he feels a little bad. That was weird. Well, you know what we should do? We should just tomorrow-- That's definitely an option, but I feel like maybe we could just try to be better than him. Maybe you could really show off, and show him that you are better, and that we're better, and we're better friends, and you know, that he should come back and hang out with us. He should! We've got to make him remember. We've got to make him remember how great we are and what he's lost. All the tricks. Oh, sorry, we didn't realize you were awake. We make a blanket fort by the fireplace. Can I peek out the door? There's just 20 or so skeletons out there. This is the perfect opportunity. Maybe we take care of it ourselves? Let's do it. Okay, you can yell, Pike, don't be so brave, and then I can say something like, but Grog, you're too strong! I don't know, let me workshop it. Grog, you're too strong! You're too strong, you're just going to kill them all anyway. Should we just wing it? Okay, ready? On the count of three. I know you can! Okay. I'm going to get my mace ready. Two. Three. Grog, you're so strong! I'm going to start swinging my mace. I start swinging my Mace of Disruption. Can I just do this as I go through? Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! I forgot, I haven't done this in a minute with undead! Okay. It says when you hit a fiend or undead with this magic weapon, the creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. So. Oh, okay. So 17 and 22. Okay, so, I don't have all of the dice out. So with undead I also roll an additional 2d6, so am I doing four? How many? Okay, so 1d6, plus 2d8. Is just one strike. Sorry, I haven't done this in a while. 1d6 plus six and 2d8 is what I have written down. For Divine Strike. Okay, so 18. Yep. Okay. 14. Grog, it's so crazy how strong you are! They're all dying! I know, Grog! My AC is 23. I'm going to Guiding Bolt down the hallway. Towards the rest of the skeletons. Oh shit! Oh yeah, Destroy Undead. Fuck, I forgot about-- Sorry, it's been a minute since I've been around them. Okay, yeah, Destroy Undead. It's been a minute. I think 16th level. I don't know if I've leveled. 18. Oh fuck, are they all making it? Do you think Scanlan saw? You and me, Grog. We're so loyal to each other. Best friends till the end. So much is happening at once, he can't see, he didn't see. Finish him, Grog, finish it. Grog, I need your help! Can I War God's Bless it? We had it. We just-- We had it. Yes you can. Give it a bite. Give it a bite. I walk back inside of the mansion. Chod saved the day. Chod saved the day. He did. He did. Yeah. I don't know what happened. Let's hear. Certain Logic to it. That actually makes a lot of sense. It just makes you feel connected to Everybody people. Yeah. (whispers) Ziggurat. He might be able to read it, Scanlan. Well, just give it a try. (whispering) I'll whisper it to you, then you say it out loud. All who read this, let it be known, by order of Aes Adon-- it's a stupid name, Scanlan. But it's fine.

Gain a plus two bonus to attack... It's a weapon. 35! Question! Five. Yeah. I can heal us. That was a lot. I'll cast Mass Cure Wounds. 3d8 plus spellcasting ability modifier. Everybody heals an extra 18 hit points. 18 points, yeah. I'm going right. Yeah, right. Do you need help? Oh no. This looks like a crazy fight. Okay. So many things on the board. I wonder if those statues are going to come to life. Seven! She's so good at initiative rolling. I have gnome cunning, so I have advantage on wisdom. What did you say it was, wisdom? 20? Maybe I don't need it? I have gnome cunning. I have advantage on wisdom, intelligence, charisma saving throws. I guess so. I know what you did. I know what you were trying to do! Shorthalt. 15. Okay, so I am going to hold my turn until after Scanlan goes. I have to tell you what I'm going to do? I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt, but I'm going to hold it until after Scanlan's turn. For Scanlan to go. Yes. Intelligence saving throw? Okay, I get advantages. Okay. Nine. Clever gnome. Get him! Can I do anything? There's no rolling against it or anything? Oh, cool. I'll be back in New York. Yeah, what if you die? Just wander off? I'll start walking back towards that way. Just start wandering. Yeah. I don't need to dash. Really?! Oh, fucking hell! They stepped into the circle? I can check. I'll try. Wisdom modifier? Okay. 22. We have to go there? If I go there, will you not be able to go with me? Okay. Thank you. Okay. Well, it's a doorway, and we have to go there. It's the only way to stop this. I don't know. Maybe we should back out. It was a doorway, and it opened into a city of sorts and in the middle was an obsidian tower. Okay. (laughing) No! Disaster averted, Keyleth. I throw my arms around her and I kiss her on the forehead, on the cheek. Sorry, I'm just so intense. Okay, do we need to talk to this dead person? I'll cast Speak with Dead. Is this one of the ones where his eye is missing, is he one of those guys? He's the guy with the-- yeah. Pull it off for sure. Okay, what do we want to know? Why an eye is missing? Five. Who do you work for? Okay. Is it safe for any of us to get through the gate? Who do you serve? Why do you have one eye missing? Was that Delilah? LAURA and I have one job! How did Delilah return? What did you say? Yeah, that's a great one. What are your plans? What are The Remnants' plans?
