Hey! I just landed. Not landed in a plane, but just drove in. From, yes. Drove in from New York. I'm here for a little while. (cheering) I'm back for a little bit. Probably for a couple months, a few months, we'll see. We're pushing it for a few months. I'm excited and I'm nervous, but I'm excited. TRAVIS and Thanks. Thank you. That's so softy-puffy. You could wear it on a plane. On a train. (Australian accent) In the outback! (accented) Going to get a bloomin' onion? I know a lot of Australians. That's so crazy. Wait, what is this one? What is this? I want that one! I-- yes. (laughter) He healed us. Yes, I'm fine! I'm fine. I think I'm okay. Do I know what hit points I'm at? I'm doing okay. Hey, it's okay, Grog. I know you didn't mean to. It sounds pretty crazy. It's okay, Grog! I'll be fine. Oh, Grog. I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be okay. I think if we just-- (laughs) I'm excited to see you guys. (laughter) Are we taking a rest? I don't know how many-- I would be okay with that. Three 4th-level. Oh gosh! Can you do Greater Restoration on a group? Who is the oldest? How old are you? You look like a fine wine, you just got better with age. They gray looks great on you, the salt and pepper hair. Would you like to be younger? Would you like to be young again? Yes. We need to get you into better order, okay? All right, where we at here? I'm going to heal her up. No, no, it's my job. Or some chicken? Yeah, are you hungry? So short rest means-- Fuck! Grog? I run over to him. I grab the sword and I take it off of his-- away from him, off of his person. What do I-- roll the 20? 11? Okay. I feel like it's the sword, I mean we all know that sword has been weird. Yes, I'll Greater Restoration on Grog. Okay, so short rest-- I have a 5th-level. I have one 5th-level, which is Greater Restoration. Aw, shit. I mean, Cure Wounds? No, that's not going to do anything. But wouldn't that be--? Oh no! I have Heal, I have one 6th-level. Wait, wait. I have Revivify! Yes. Yes yes yes yes yes. You touch a creature that has died-- I wasn't even looking at my 3rd-levels. Oh, goodness. Okay. Okay. Can I do this first? Just to see if it works? 14. Just for extra, yeah. This is so stressful! I want to go back! You fell over dead! It's not your sword anymore. Yeah, I walk over and I stop Grog. We brought you back! It was a group effort! Because she gave you a little to bring you back! Well, I could try to-- No! You're not going to touch it again! Percy, what did you get from it? What were you going to say, Vax? That's true. I could try casting Greater Restoration on the sword. Grog! I mean, it stabbed me, so yeah, I'm uncomfortable. It's okay. It's not your fault. We'll find you a better weapon. I don't want you to die from something that's not worth it. We'll find you something strong. What would happen if you threw it into the sphere? It would get, yeah, that would be bad. You don't think it would work if I tried Greater Restoration? I do, I have one more 5th-level. I do. Okay, hold on a minute. First, Grog is at one hit point. Okay? So I'm going to use my 6th-level and I'm going to use Heal. I don't know. Because I remember it worked one time on-- didn't we try that on his-- And then he could keep the sword. Should we try it? Let's try it. Bring it. A d10? That was beautiful, Scanlan. Okay. 17. Okay. 26. No, wait. Yeah, 26. (laughs) Oopsie. I'm scared to let go of it. No. No. Grog, what did you think we were telling you? Grog. Since we got rid of Craven Edge, do you want the Gauntlets of Ogre Power back? Yeah, but you're the muscle. I take them off and I give them back. Are we doing a trade? Ooh! Does it maybe make me quiet as well? I could be a Pike kite! Grog, that would kill me! All right, I'll take Boots of Levitation. And you get these so you're super strong again. Hey, I felt real cool punching that chicken that one time. (laughter) What did you say? That's true, that's most important. Hey, thanks. Anytime. That's a scroll. All I just saw was "dark aura" in really dark letters. Chicken and waffles, perhaps? Oh, just eggs, okay. I don't know, it's like a mishmash of dough, the side-- Such a twinsies. Disadvantage? Okay. Can I put on my Boots of Levitation? SAM, LIAM, and I rolled a six. Pike is back! What would it be without some clanging? I don't think I did, though. (laughter) 19. Mr. Vina. Mr. Drez Vina. (coughs) It just makes me so nervous. This is not a bad idea. I think he will. Let's make sure that it doesn't happen, that they won't know. These are very scary people, you guys. They left him in a very horrible state and I would not like to see that again. I like this idea. I'm going to use, oh no. Because that won't be enough time. Plus ten? 24. We're quiet. 23. I could cast Speak with Dead and we could ask him some questions. We could ask him up to five questions. Can we give him a proper burial? We're going to put him back up, that's what you. Sorry. I don't answer. No, I'm just kidding. Hi, Scanlan. Oh, yes, slippers and everything. Yes, it's great, thank you so much. P.T. Yes, it smells so good in here. Thank you. Oh, thank you, Scanlan. What is this? "Do not open" and in parentheses "(until I'm dead)." Well, hopefully I never have to open this. Bye, Scanlan. I close the door, I open it, and I read it. (cheering) This is a bit of tome, so I think I should wait to read this, but a part of me-- Oh. Oh, man. (gasps) No, I, go. What if you borrow my boots that levitate? Then you can-- All right, all right, bad idea. What's something that they would chase after? How are you going to be the bait? It will, it will.
