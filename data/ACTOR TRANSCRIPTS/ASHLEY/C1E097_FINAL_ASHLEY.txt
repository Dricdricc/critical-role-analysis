How der der der der. What? Oh my god! It's only 715! Okay. Go get her! Stop laughing, Travis! Stop it! Oh my god. It's okay. Just know I don't want you to-- if you don't want to stay here, you don't have to stay here. I'm not holding you here against your will in any way, but I would love for you to stay because I would love to get to know you better. Okay. What happened? Do we need to fix anything? Yes! Cure Wounds! You just dove off, Free Willy-nilly? I forgot that that's what that was. I felt a (whirring), you know? I'm going to heal her up a little more. A what? Yeah! I'll do a Cure Wounds. I haven't used any spells. Let's do 5th level. Where are you at now? I say we go back. I would love to go back and maybe have lots of drinks. Good call. And JB, if there is anything you need out of there. Okay. No! Oh, that's a great idea! I feel like she would be great at it. Would you even be interested in maybe running a bakery? Or is that something that just sounds like the most dreadful thing in the world? Do you bake? This is a beautiful cream puff. No. (laughter) This is delicious. This is better than anything that we make. Have you tried any of our baked goods, yet? Can I insight check her? Because I don't trust anybody. 27. I get a whisper?! I don't think on the show I've had a whisper. Well, I think that she should die. I'm just kidding. (laughter) Do you have references? How long has your husband been missing? About six months. No, I'm not. JB, don't feel pressured if you don't want to do this. She's a fantastic baker. Yeah, that seems like a little more fun. Hilda. (whispering) But Grog, you can read some of those books a little bit. Well, okay. I think this is a great idea. No, but I think she should plan for her life if he's not coming back. Yeah. The stupid box that we buried still haunts me to this day. I would love to come! She's a loner? Why is there no furniture in her apartment? Mountain flowers. Are there children's books in here? (whispers) Where are they? Can I see if I can find a kid's book? 13. Orchid. Sometimes when those letters are together, it sounds like a K. Is there a place-- just ask Percy privately. She can stay with me. Do I have an extra bedroom? Or how does this work? Maybe there's a Murphy bed or something extra in the room. JB? Do you-- I don't know how-- You are more than welcome to stay with me. I do have night terrors, so sometimes not fun, but you can stay with me or you could have your own room. Okay. Wait, which one? Just wait it out. Nah. Okay. This will be fun. It'll be like sleepovers. Maybe we can make a fort! Just all the blankets. Tapestries. I have a feeling you are a great fort builder. Percy, thank you. Yes, please. It's Critical Role's dice. T-shirts! Backblaze! I want to know. It was so much! I took JB back and we built a fort in the room. Is he at the bakery? I'll check the bakery. (whispers) Yeah. Is Hilda there? I don't see anything here, Hilda's not here. The bakery looks normal. What if he's still here? I've made my way upstairs? Well, Hilda never showed up for her interview! (laughter) Doty? Doty? Do you know where Taryon went? I feel like-- could you give him the book? Could you draw something for me again? Do you know where Taryon went? Can you draw it? Shit, I thought he listened to me. He does listen to me. Oh, that's right, Doty. You're new. You're new Doty. Doty, don't do that. Doty, don't play that. Do you bake cream puffs? Thank the chat? They know. I like that idea. That smoke plume knows where it's going. Is it possible she could've put some kind of covering over them? Yeah. Dangly bits. Should we mist that way? I like that idea. It's a critical stealth! I'll stand in the middle of the road. Maybe I can act like I'm an old woman trying to cross the road. I'm going to pull up my cloak and slowly start crossing. Excuse me! Ma'am? No! What's your name? You should still make your dad pay, though! You could say, I would've come here-- And if you show up with all of us and her, say you could've just called, I would've shown up, but you still have to pay her. Well, I don't know. I don't know him. You know, she was able to find you. Maybe she could also find somebody else for us. A very good friend. Well, hold on, Tary. If you had it your way, what would you want? Majority rules, but let's hear what you have to say. That's fair. Did I overhear them? 16. Okay. She doesn't have to bring him or anything, it could be just looking, bring us information if she sees him. We don't have to! We don't have to do it, but I do like the idea of this woman-- this woman had a job to do. It's not her fault. I'm sorry, Tary, but I do feel like we need to let her complete her mission. I know. I know, but I feel like he should've come back already. What if he's dead? If that's the case, then maybe she can tell us that and then we'll leave it alone. But what if he's dead? Yes, I like that idea. See, she thinks-- I like that idea. She owes us a favor at some point. Maybe we should table it. Is there any other way than marriage that you can think of? You can't marry her. No, you don't. Two points. Do you know Lydia? Here's the thing, you're not going to marry her. Okay? Because if he wants to be a better father to you, then he's going to let this go and not let you do this. If that means him being out on the street, that's my opinion. Sometimes, when you let that go, only then are you able to truly live. I don't even have any money. Money gives you everything you want. I say we go talk to the Many. No! We all have such terrible families.
