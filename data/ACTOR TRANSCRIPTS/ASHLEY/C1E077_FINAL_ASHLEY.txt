Hello, everybody! I've lost my voice a little bit, but you know what? Fuck it! Der-n-der! Yeah! Get him. No! But he didn't say to not use your broom. Okay. So, getting up to speed here. So Percy's kind of low? Okay. I have on my Sprinter's Boots. I'm next to you? Can I make it to the trebuchet in the corner with my Sprinter's Boots or even without? Okay, then I will use my Sprinter's Boots. Okay. So I'll cast Cure Wounds-- Percy? No, because now I can't do it to Scanlan. Okay, so what are you at? Okay. So let's do a 3rd-level Cure Wounds. Okay. Maybe I should do-- I'm going to do a fourth level. Because we need you. Well, you're at the trebuchet now. Okay. 23. And then-- shoot! I was going to do something before I moved, but I forgot. So now, for my bonus action, I'm going to create a beautiful, divine sword, Spiritual Weapon, and put it up to the belly of the giant. I have four 3rd-levels, so I think I actually have an extra 3rd-level. Because of the necklace. All right. Okay, I'll just do it at second. I'll just do it at second level, then. Get him. Go away. How do we get-- we have to-- Dang it, you're so cool! Get away from him. Get away from him! Come on. 64. Okay. Right at the door. Just in case. Oh my god. Would you consider him a friend? This guy's the worst. He sucks! So, I have a quick question. So the thing that Percy was trying to do with the trebuchet. Did it not work because it wasn't--? You're weak, okay. I want to try and give it a go. Ugh, what do I roll? Ooh, 28! 2d6? Eight. Okay, so I'm going to try to-- Okay. 12. I'm going to point it right at the fire bird. (bink) 27! Wait, aren't we attacking him? Okay, bonus action, is there only one charge on that thing? Can I keep doing it, or no? Okay, I guess for my bonus action I'm going to cast Shield of Faith on Percy. I guess it's not going to help you. I'm going to use the spiritual weapon. Toward the giant. 16. I'm going to use Guided Strike to add ten. Oh but no, I don't want to, is it too late to retract that? I wanted to use that for something bigger. It's not going to do that much damage. No, it's okay. I'll wait for something bigger. I'm going to stay. Yeah. Well, I'll move out a little bit then, I didn't know it would take so much. Towards the giant. I don't know why! All right! Jeez. That's so much, Grog. No. Okay. I have resistance to fire. Yeah, he did a melee attack so the attacker suffers 2d6. Yeah. Okay. Are you okay!? Shut the fuck up. Oh, are we going to die? Scanlan, run in the tent. I love Dungeons & Dragons. Kill it! 15. I was just going to take my turn! I hate him! Oh, that's true! If you're knocked unconscious by an attack or spell, a blast of healing flames surrounds you! You immediately regain five hit points and are lifted to your feet. All hostile creatures within 15 feet of you must make a dexterity saving throw. He's the worst! Okay! I sound so puny with this voice! I'm going to try my tried and true pal, Guiding Bolt! I'm going to Guiding Bolt at fifth level, right in the belly of the beast. Maybe he'll fail! I'll do the disadvantage. Adding my spell attack? Okay. So, 14. I rolled two at the same time. It does? Ooh! Okay, so 8d6? Okay, so how many of these, (counting). Oh, these were bad rolls. Well, that's a-- (counting) Do I add anything? It's just those? 22. Okay. Guh. Oh yeah. 1d8 plus five. 11. No, 11 damage. Roll that again? Ooh, yeah, that hits. So another? Oh, oh, sorry. Oh, I'm using my Mace of Disruption. Arrr! I'm a monstah! Oh, that's right, we still have him and her. Yeah, get him. He made a mistake. Oh, yeah. Where are you at? I heal him 30 points with my last... Did we loot the giant? Yeah. I'm going to cast a Greater Restoration on her. I have it. Can I-- well, I don't have any 5th-level left yet-- wow. I don't have any 5th-level left, but I have a seventh. Can I cast it at a seventh? Yeah, can I cast it at that? This is so stressful. It's okay. It's okay. I'm going to help you. Oh, I grab her and hug her. I just have so much armor on. Okay. Because of the necklace, I have one 3rd-level spell left. Because I've used three. So maybe just face it towards me? Let's try to make him like us. Like we were a friend, we're sad that he died. God, okay. Yeah. Okay, so I'm going to walk over to him, and I'm going to put my hand on his face, and I'm going to say, my friend, I am so sorry that you've fallen in battle, but I had to bring you back to ask you some questions. I just got so nervous. (laughter) So we know that you've been working with Thordak and I have some questions. Has Thordak had a visit from Raishan? 22. I just have a couple, or four more questions for you? (laughter) Do you know of any secret entrances into Emon? Are we looking for allies, like who doesn't-- Who still in the city resists-- I have one job! I feel so-- (laughter) Computer! Who still in the city resists Thordak? We have one more question, but is there anything else? He might not know about that. Open a magic cafe. Of course, if you need us, you do blow that horn. 'Cause we will hear it. Is there a room with a big fireplace in it, and we can all just have a sleepover? Are there hides and things, like, fluffies we can lay on? Ah, I like the dirt. How old are they? I don't feel anything. I mean, I have underclothes. Just like bareback armor.ASHLEY,  Hell yeah!, TRAVIS, TRAVIS I voted Gilmore. Neither of them want to go, but she's so scared now. You got it, Keyleth. We already just slept.
