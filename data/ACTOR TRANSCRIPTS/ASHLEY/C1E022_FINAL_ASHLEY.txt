Oh, hi! Hello. Oh, you know. Here we are. Oh boy. It's so good to see you guys. I've been working on the temple, and some people are great there, and some aren't. It's been great. I'm just so glad to be back. I got a couple of days off, so I figured I needed to come hang out with the group. I'm here for about a week. Yes! We were doing a lot of dusting. You know, you have your little brush? And I came across some blue shit, and I was wondering what it was, so I just kept it there. I didn't clean it. I just thought it was so fascinating. I had to leave it there. Well, I picked it up, and I put it aside in a jar, just in case. I had gloves, just in case. That's what I thought. Where did you guys get these cookies? Merkin? Oh, hi! I'm sorry, I'm so rude. I'm Pike! Mertin? Merktin. What is it? Yeah, I have some time. I think we should just hang out like old times just for a little bit. Should we take the carpet? She would never do such a thing. She wouldn't do it. You're lying. Is it now just a rug? You'll get it re-enchanted. I wonder if I could re-enchant it with the poo. I don't know what it is! Yes, why not? Okay. I don't have any dice. I'm sorry. I'm just a little too excited to do this right now. Yeah, coming from work. Tired, the time change. We'll try it again later, maybe. Okay. Is there a little scruff there? I caught it! No, don't blow it away! You were kissed? (gasps) Oh! I don't know who that is. (laughter) That's what I was thinking. What if she gets mad? Oh, that's a great feeling. Whoa. What happens if I were to just pinky in? Give it a little taste. Would there be any result? I'm going to wait and try it. 30,000 gold pieces from where? Oh, you didn't collect them yet. I love you, too. Well, wait. Where's Scanlan? Oh, he needed a massage? I get it. I think I can. And then, if I have to leave, at least I can maybe meet your family for a little bit. He was one of the Ashari? That was a good one. She just needs some time. Well, I have Spiritual Weapon. So I guess, yes? Well. What do you want? What are you looking for? I know what that means. We'll take just a small nap. Oh, who's that? Is he sick? Yeah, I'll do just a small healing. What was I rolling for? Checking about the health. I rolled a seven. He looks really sick! Maybe you should name him Lockheed Peach. Is he starting to look any better? Could I try healing him a little bit? We're doing it! Yeah, you're going to do it. Wait, what happens if you don't stay on the road? I mean I have an idea, but-- Wow. Do you know what they've been attacked by? You don't know. LAURA and Hydra? Not as in the-- I understand. Wait, but where do you put Lockheed Peach? Yeah! Oh, man! I'm going to try the carpet again. Two. I know. I'm sorry, Sarenrae. Yay, that's amazing. Immune to being frightened? All of us? The opposite of tryptophan? You fell asleep! Do they have a reputation of being-- Is there anything we can do to help? Or just make you feel a little bit more at ease? Vox Machina, that's all it is. 17. 17. 19. I have been oiling my armor. 15? Run. Run zig-zags! Hidden Valley ranch. Sorry, it sounds so stupid. (laughter) Oh, are we--? 13. Can I assist? Oh, you don't need assistance. Nine. For what? Because we had the Heroes' Feast, are we not frightened? 23. Let me do it again. Natural 20. 13. Hi. No! 18. Who rolled high? Okay. So I have the Frost Brand Sword, so I'm resistant to fire damage if I'm holding it. But I would like to use a Guiding Bolt, because it's a little bit more damage. Okay. Let's do the guy right there. The big guy. That's only 15. 15? Yay! Okay. 11. You know what, so sorry. I was casting that at a three. Yeah, sorry. 18. 18 total. Where am I at? You know what, I'm going to back up. Yeah. Okay. All right. My armor class is 20, so they both hit me. Point taken! (singing) This girl is on fire! (laughter) Oh no, wait! My Frost Brand sword. I'm resistant to fire damage! 16 points, okay. Wait, so what was it? TRAVIS and Percy, where are you at, in terms of hit points? I know. He's at 12. Can I get over to Vax? Sprinter's Boots. 29. That's a little bit of something. Could I do a Mass Cure Wounds before I go? Because I was going to do that right last minute. All of us? Five. I'm going to ask him to drop me, and I'm going to do a Mass Cure Wounds. Oh fuck, how high am I? He's dying! Oh. That's good. Eight. TRAVIS 19. 16. 33, guys. That's a good idea. What does kaitiake mean? (quietly) Oh, but I don't want to go back. (laughter) Pickles. Well... debatable. This was so great, being a part of your journey that you had. Okay. Well, I guess I'll go. Kaitiake. (cheering) Hugs and loves. Oh, thanks. You're my favorite-- everything, I guess. (laughter) Oh, okay. Can she use it? Well, she already has that.
