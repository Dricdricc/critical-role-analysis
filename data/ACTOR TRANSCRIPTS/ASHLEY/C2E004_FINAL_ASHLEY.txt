Hey. Yeah. No, that's completely a misunderstanding of things. That's not what happened. Well-- I feel like I didn't need to be in there anymore. You know. I don't-- ugh. I feel like-- 11. It's good to see you guys, too. I have a little bit of a problem with authority and I didn't want to be caught in a small and confined space and then that ended up happening. Immediately after I ran away. They sent out horses. I'm not that fast, but I did fuck up a few of the guards. "By accident. " Where's Toya? Wait, so who killed him? It was him? What's happened with Toya? How is she? Oh, well-- I mean, I kind of go on my own, but-- (laughs) You're very funny. You could always try to take it. Yeah. You do look pretty strong. I mean, you're just a little bit bigger than me, but I still think I could probably take you. What about your sword? I think it's something that kids play. I have a better version of that game. We can play it later. No, I'm just going to float around like I usually do. I will. Toya. What are your plans? What do you want to do? I mean, I'll say it. I don't know if you will, but I think that little girl is creepy. (laughter) Yeah. Yeah. Maybe for a little bit, but I've got some things I need do, so. Where are you going, again? Where's... where northeast? I would love a map. Okay. We'll go shopping with you. Oh, are you scared of me? Well, I thought you were Nott, the Brave? But you guys were there together? Because you knew each other before? It just depends where in the south, actually. You know. I'm just-- I'll make my way wherever we go and maybe I'll not stay with you the whole time but I don't like, you know-- Yeah. I don't-- groups and things-- Uh, no. I like to have my freedom. No. I don't mean it like that. I just want to make my own way sometimes. (chuckles) Yeah, that's right. What happened to you? Was this a test of some sort? Yeah. I think I'll join you. Oh, I did actually want to see that map. I think that's a great idea. Seeing me see a map is something pretty special. Maybe not all of them. That is so beautiful. I also really like what you've done with the place. Do you have a deal, you know, if we got all of them? That seems pretty high. Right? That seems pretty high for a healing potion. Three. How do we know if it's good quality, though? Can I give it a sample? Well, you might as well make another one. I'm not going to let my friend experience it alone. You don't want to go to Zadash, is that right? Yasha. SAM; It's like Ash, with an -ay. Oh. I'm not going to kill you. All right, well. That was very nice of you, thank you. I take out a book that I have and in between some of the pages is a four-leaf clover. I'll take the flowers and I'll put them in between the other pages, and I'll put it away. I think I need to stay here just a little bit longer. But I will meet you guys there at some point? I just don't think I can leave here until I'm told I can. No, I just-- I have things that I need to do-- I have reasons, I can stay, I just need to converse with somebody to see where my next step leads. No, yes, no. It's not him. No. When you get to Zadash, maybe send me a note, or maybe I'll be there. I just have to do a couple things. Okay. That sounds like a plan. Hopefully soon, I never know. I'll try. I don't think any of them are watching.
