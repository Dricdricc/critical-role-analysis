Really?! Take a chill pill, Mrs. Henderson! I need those crotches for my Home Ec project! Oops! (laughter) Ch-yeah! Now I'm going to put on my British Knight Sneakers and see that brand-new movie, Labyrinth. (laughter) No doy, Mrs. Henderson! You said, "Take out the trash," and it was the stinkiest thing in the house. (quietly) Gag me with a spoon, Mrs. Henderson. Because current First Lady Nancy Reagan gave me some bitching advice! When teacher says, "Do your homework," just say no! TALIESIN and Gag me with a spoon, Mr. and Mrs. Henderson! It's the tuna casserole you were talking about. I feel like I slept outside? I was going to interact. I think I slept outside. I forgot. Around my glorious beard? I don't have a beard. Yeah, I'll go check in. I'll walk in and give them a nod, and then go get an ale. First things first. Just a big a drink, an ale. An ale. It's morning. She just, I mean, she gives you your drink, so I think it's a nice woman to me. I have no idea. Oh. Slam down my-- go. Okay. That's fine. No! Seriously?! Throw that away! Yeah, I don't think we help him. We just (whoosh). Did we get him in? Oh, okay. By all means, Jester. Here, hold on. Don't let it snag the earrings. Four. Just let me do it. I know I'll get it in. It's like a weird shape, you know? What game did you play? I wonder if there are any more games. I was really looking forward to looking for ridiculous meats. Not meads, but maybe we can-- Let's go play this game. Okay. I'll give five gold. Five silver, I mean. I'm so sorry. Two swings? Shit, okay. All right. That's what I was going to try. When in doubt. Okay, I'll go first. Okay, so I would like to rage. Ah! Just strength? Oof. Okay, 17. Well, I have another go. I did. I gave you ten. 24. TRAVIS and Thank you. Can I count it? Oh shit, how much-- She's next. I would very much-- I have never had a candied apple before. I'll take the candy, because I've never had it. I thought it was the rats-- Double rats, yeah. That's it? Because I thought that was dinner. We have-- It's my favorite. Well, were you going to eat one? No, I like to have it cooked. It falls off the bone. It's like a nice-- Let's try it. Which one did you do the arm wrestling with, Beau? Are you going to take a shot at this, Fjord? Extra strong? Because of the candied apple. I mean, Beau is-- No, he didn't. Oh. Are you doing any more of the wrestling with the arms? Sure. (whispers) Yasha. Hello. Okay. I shake my hair a little. I try not to make eye contact. I'm looking down and putting my hair down. Away. What do you mean? Well, neither are you. What does that have to do with anything? Natural 20. (cheering) This was thanks to Gil. Shit! What does that mean? Fuck. Can I rage? I don't know if I can do that. Okay. I'll do it on the next one. Okay. Seven. Okay. How far away is everybody from us? Oh shit. Okay. Never mind. Okay, okay. 21. With advantage? This is very stressful. Okay. 21. Okay. Oh shit. (stammering) I can't do math right nowbecause I'm stressed. 14. No! 14. Oh no. 17. Okay. LIAM and 22. 21. Okay. 19. Immediately when I slam him, I get up and walk off. (cheering) No. Oh. I don't. Okay. I will take this with me. I don't like groups of people working together for a cause. I will take it with me. I walk away. What does it-- did you look at it yet? Can you read it for me? Nott, do you want mine? Just in case, if you want to join? I could tell. I mean, it depends on what kind of work, I guess. Oh, well yeah. Hello Darrow. My name is Yasha. What kind of work? It's just going out and killing things? It's no contract? You can come and go as you please if you like? Yeah. Yeah, you can say so. Maybe. I don't know. Do you have like a pamphlet or something? We were actually thinking of going that way. The Mighty Nein. They're all actually very, very strong and very tough. So-- You said you've been fighting on the frontlines of Xhorhas, or-- What are you fighting, if I may ask? Well, in Xhorhas. If you go out there. You haven't been to Xhorhas. They've kept you in the Empire. I understand. How do I-- what? Do I show it around or--? I think it's great, you know. Yeah. What did you just get up to? What are we fighting? Are we fighting the other groups, or are we fighting something-- Yasha. Thank you. Have you been in this tournament before? Six. Six. Can I do that on the other one, opposite her? Gag me with a spoon! Six! Fists of fury! Fists of furry, Mrs. Henderson! Does that mean I do twice the damage? (high-pitched) Ooh! I'm like 5'11". Excellent. I'm into that. We can go in that order. If I move-- (deep voice) If I move (normal voice) right here, am I ten feet of the creature, but they're not ten feet of me, right? Okay, I get one more, but I'm not ten feet away from Beau and Jester, right? Can I go one over to the right? You know what, I won't do that right now. I would like to rage. I'm going to use my Magician's Judge sword and start swinging. Say again? Oh, no. 14. (counting) 20. I added all my shit. Yep, and I'm going to stay right there. 14. Okay, I'm not going to use that one. Eight. 15 points? Oh, this sucks! Yeah. Fuck yes. Yes. Natural 20. 13. I'm going to attack again. Do I have advantage on attack, or no? Yes, that's right, I haven't used reckless yet. Shit. That gives me advantage, but that gives them advantage on attacks. Sorry guys. Natural 20. I see. 41. No way, really? I want to take the blade, turn it down, and straight into the middle of it. I run back into the hidden area immediately, and I don't stay out there. Jester, what are you at, right now? I give her a potion of healing. No it's fine! Yes, I'm sure. What about the teal thing? What was the-- Who did The Mountain Makers fight? They're changing. Am I able to take a potion of healing? I'm going to stand by Caleb, actually. Yeah. 15! I was just, I'll wait until the end. Oh wait, I rolled high! Look at the blood on there already. Look at me, look at me! Natural one. Okay. Okay, so reckless. Let me see something here. Sorry. Where's the hex? Divine Fury? Can I do that as well? I don't have any more. Yeah. Wait, do I have advantage, or that's it? Sorry. Natural 20 again. (cheering) Divine Fury is an extra-- Ugh. (counting) Eight. Well, is Divine Fury an extra d6. It's three, I'm sorry. Okay. (counting) Seven, ten, 27. 14. 24. Okay, I'm going to take another attack. Wait, I'm within ten-- oh, yeah, I'm right next to Fjord, huh? All right, I'm going to take another attack. Reckless, all the stuffs. Natural one. Natural 20! (cheering) Okay. Nine, 18 (counting) 25 points of damage. Probably still not enough. I want to grab over his head, rip-- Say that again? It's 23, okay. Okay. Wait, what's the plus five-- break it down again? Okay, right, I see what you're saying. Okay, sorry. I need to write all these down in my notes later so we don't have to keep going through this. I'm going to go over the top of his head and force his jaw open and then take my blade and put it through its mouth, straight through its mouth. Skewer it. Fucking yes. I'm pretty bad. We could also try to get inside and get the chains because they are scared of those and-- Okay. I'm taking a fucking door. I don't like it. Oh that's true, that's true. I'm over there flanking with Beau. Nott, you're staying there? They won't see him maybe they won't-- Dang it! I want to fight it right now! MARISHA and
