Okay! Okay! Hello, everybody! Okay, so where am I? Okay, so the door is open? Okay. Can I pop out? How close am I to either of the bad guys? Okay, am I close to Vax at all, if I peek out? Okay, I'm going to pop out and I'm going to heal Keyleth, because you're hurting? Okay, here I come! Ooh! Okay. Am I close to her? Sorry, I can't see the map. You all look like little pixelated blocks. Okay. So I'm going to cast Healing Word, then, since I can't touch her. (mumbling) Sorry guys, this is taking a minute. Okay, well, you heal nine points. So, the bonus, is the Spiritual Weapon still out there? Can I move it 20 feet closer to them? All right, I'll leave it if I can't see. That'll be my turn. That's enough. Right by me. Is he looking rough? Okay, am I even near Keyleth at all, or no? Okay, I'm going to do that. Fantastic. Big money, big money. Okay, so I'm going to do it at sixth level. Plus my spellcasting? That's the plus five. Okay, so 4d8. Shit, that's not a lot. Ooh! Okay, 31. As my bonus action, can I move the Spiritual Weapon any closer to the pit fiend? Do I see him now? Just to taunt him a little? I'm going to wave at him. No! It doesn't hit! (laughter) Oh, boy, that's bad. I got an eight. My armor class is 20. Unless, there were no aids with that--? I'm unconscious, I'm unconscious. Oh god, sorry, that was so wasteful. Okay, well, let's see. 1d8 plus one? I don't know what to do. I don't think I've done this before. That was a five. Don't, it's dangerous! I'll take it! Can I run out to her? I think I got skipped! Oh, so Scanlan goes again? Can I peek outside? You're in the mansion? Okay! I'm going to check what I have left here, which is, let's see. I'm going to do Cure Wounds at fifth level. 35. I'm going to stay here in the mansion because I'm useless. 1d12 plus what? I healed to 74, B-T-W. Just for funsies. Well, okay. Aw, I can't really read it. All right, that's a little-- (laughter) Not to be greedy, milady, but what's the story with that ruby shield? (laughter) I feel like it matches. That's my only reason I'm asking. Well, it wasn't taken from you. Okay, thank you so much. (laughter) It's still loud? Should I read it? Okay. Beautiful brass scrolling and priceless cut rubies adorn this silver set of armor. Worn by the high priest Duana of Pelor as she fell in the battle of Ghor Dranas. While wearing this armor, you gain a plus-three bonus to AC?! You cannot be frightened, and you gain resistance to fire damage, and when you are struck by a melee attack, the attacker suffers 2d6 points of fire damage! If you are knocked unconscious by an attack or spell, a blast of healing flame surrounds you. You immediately regain five hit points and are lifted to your feet! All harmful creatures within 15 feet of you must make a dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 fire damage, half damage on a success, and once you've used this ability you cannot use it again until the next dawn. Oh man. What the heck. Is it a bad idea to just be like We're all done. We just got to go do a thing. You know where we are. We'll be right back. Can I roll an insight check? 18. Why is it important to bury it there? Oh, what was your wife's name? Do you want us to put a marker there or anything like that? We have all the Vestiges!
