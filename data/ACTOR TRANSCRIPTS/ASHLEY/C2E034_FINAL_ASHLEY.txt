Surprise! Oh hi! Hi! Oh, fuck. Hey. Oh, hello everyone. What are the odds? I'm just passing through here. No. You sent messages? What did they say? Yeah, I've never seen the ocean either, but-- I just got here a bit ago. I've been-- Yeah. I am trying to get in the water. I need to go somewhere. I'm trying to find passage to go somewhere. (sighs) Yeah. I've been on a journey and I have somewhere to go. At least, I think that I need to go. Not immediately. We can have a drink or two. PBR? It's fine. I can't tell the difference. Thank you, Beau. I don't exactly know where I'm going. No, I just-- Yeah. I had dreams of a place that I need to go to. They're islands. You mean--? The guy that sweats all the time? Jester! So your mom's the Ruby of the Sea, and then The Gentleman. He's a pretty interesting man. I wish I could've met your mother. You did? Just some stuff. Ho ho ho. (laughter) Who's this guy that's been messing with your mom? That sounds like someone whose ass I would like to kick. I have no idea who that is. Yeah, that sounds-- I don't even remember it. Algar? Al Gore? I'll be okay. I've had to work through some things. Speaking of, it looks like you have a new member already in the group. Well, thank you. I'm sure we could've made it if we had more time. But thank you for helping. Yes, here I am. No. I don't know if I like you. Your dead tea? What is a dead tea? What is it? Does it taste good? I'm not opposed to such things. I have a fine palate. Oh. Okay. Sounds like a plan. Well, they come in my dreams, as most of my visions have. It's the way that I commune with the Stormlord, and-- I don't know. I'm trying to find some purpose for all this, I guess. No, I mean, the purpose of all-- At least, I think I am. Well, thank you. What was your name again? Caduceus Clay. That's a very interesting name. That's very nice. No, I've missed you guys too, but, sometimes it's just best to go my own way sometimes. It's true. Isn't it weird? Where did you get-- whoa! That's, uh, that's okay. This is Sprinkle? That's a very cute little thing. I don't want to crush it. There's a dog? Aww. I do like dogs very much. This is very cute. Who's this-- What's his name? SAM, LAURA and Nugget. Where did you send them to? Did I get any messages? I did have times when I was walking, where I heard your voice, but I didn't really hear words. It was more like (indiscernible babbling). I didn't get any-- Are you guys doing a play? Yeah. Do you want to ride on my back? I am a very good swimmer. Yes? Yes, I've-- It is very pretty. Actually, I've been looking at it already. At night. Yeah, well, I just didn't want to tell you guys everything. Yeah. Been here for three days. I didn't know you were coming. Maybe-- this is the closest ocean that I knew. Maybe your message did get across, Jester, and I did hear it somewhere in the corner of my brain. Yeah. Could I look to see if anyone's watching us out on the shore? I don't think I actually see anything. I think I forgot my glasses. I rolled a seven. We're safe. Are there any like buttons or key holes in any of the grates? I'm okay with unpredictable. Can you keep him down there just to watch us? Do you want to roll? He said roll with advantage or roll independently. This is a strength check? 20. Not a natural 20. Yeah. I didn't either, but it's open. At least one of them. Should we try the other one? We're pulling down right after three. I got a ten. Jester, you are very strong. Man we're like a strong couple of women! (laughter) Oh, my god. Nott! Yeah. We could give it a go. Let's do it. 12. Hey guys. (laughing) Nine. Yeah, I even have a plus to my initiative this time around. I still rolled low. I rolled a seven. Okay, so-- Well for one, I would like to rage. Is it possible to try to pull her out, or am I able to-- Am I able to attack it... without hurting her? I don't want to try it. I'm going to attempt and pull her out. Oh, no. Eight. Yeah, I should've attacked. Shit. That's cocked. 17. (deep voice) Welcome! (deep voice) Wow! No, I'm going to stay. Ooh. Melf. The other one? Okay. I got a five. It's just a lot of water and I think just more stone walls. I don't think it's bad. And you guys already checked the pillar for any-- Can I give the pillar a look-see? 17. Nothing strange. I'll go behind Fjord. Bitty Beau. 15. "My will is my bond." Give it to me now. Oh, what? He's awesome-looking. 15. ASHLEY, LAURA, and 15. I got 15. Shoot for the sky. Where's the little (clicking sounds)? Good job, Matt! Good job. So scary! I rolled a natural one, but I do now have Fanatical Focus. So if you fail a saving throw-- while you're raging, and I'm not. Natural one. LAURA and Whoa. Yes! That was awesome. Okay, I would like to rage. TRAVIS and I'm prone, right? The other half of the movement then, could I get to the other side of the water elemental then? 40? Okay. I'm going to take an attack. 17. That's awesome. (counting) 13. Oh, I forgot about that. Jesus, sorry. Oh, that does not hit. No, that does not hit. Seven. Yeah. 18. Okay, so. I'm going to attack this water elemental where I can-- if I can see an open spot that Caduceus is not in. Wait, do I get an extra roll? The first attack was 16, but it was cocked. 19? 18. Does he look like he's getting loose at all? Oh, fuck. And I don't get to roll again, right? Oh yes, let me do reckless. Yeah. Okay that'll definitely hit. Yeah, I'm sorry I'm out of practice, guys. And I'm on east coast time. Okay, 24. Ooh, okay. 15. Yeah, because I can't take another attack. I'm going to back up a little bit. Well, will it get an attack of opportunity? Okay, I'll just stay where I am. It's waterboarding, basically. (groans) Yes. Ooh, ten. Oh, reckless! Reckless. I can also grab him out next turn. I don't know. I'm going to go up and try to stabby-stab what I can. Okay. (whispers) Oh my god. First is 13. Yeah. Fuck. Second hit? Okay. 15? Okay nice! 17. Yes. And then-- I don't have-- Hold on one second, let me just check something really quickly. Okay that's an action, never mind. Okay, I'd like to back up, if I can. Yes, behind this pole so I'm not in range of-- Yeah. What's his fuck. Yep. Oh, hell yeah. Oh, that's awesome! No. (groans)
