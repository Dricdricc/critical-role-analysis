Hello everybody. I wish it were better circumstances. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay. What's happening? Yeah. I think I can. I think I can, I will try. I don't know. I've never done anything quite like this before. I mean, most of the time you guys have been there for resurrections, I don't know. I don't know. We just have to try. That's good. No, no, no. It's okay. I would rather be here, and I'm glad that you guys called me. Hi Vax. Hi, it's Pickle. No, I didn't. I go and I give him a big 'ol hug. A Jello-y hug. Gloop! Of course, Vax. I give him a cotton candy kiss on his forehead. Keyleth. Have I met-- I don't know-- My memory is not-- Who are you? Yes, I didn't realize you were still with my family. Oh, it's fine, I can-- Ah, yes. Oh wow. How did you destroy it? Do tell me. I dabble. It's terrible. But it's nice to be able to speak it. Oh? All gnomes know each other, so who was it? It was a fellow, that narrows it down. That sounds like somebody that I would love tremendously. He sounds very familiar. Like I said, us gnomes do know each other. Yeah. Thousands, even. Thousands. It's something you should know. Yes, I should-- if you need to know anything, you should always ask me. I will tell you all the truths. (laughs) Well. You are just delightful. (all laugh) (laughs) Okay. No, that's fine. He's a little bit of a twat, isn't he? I don't mind him, though. All right. I'm eating my feelings. (all laugh) Ooh. Thanks! I love it. Is that for-- Ooh (laughs). Oh, you're so great. He doesn't know your names. (laughs) (claps) Grog! That was cool! Probably. (laughs) Oh, it's-- (gasps) Percy, it's beautiful! I want it now. (laughs) Yeah. Wow. If I touch her, does she feel like a dragon? Yeah! I did want to go. I want to go. It's fine if I fall apart. It happens. I was here first. Wow. You're a beast. Holy cow. Did you have so much fun, Grog? Yeah. Hey, crew. Is Doty, Dottie, his robot around? Fantastic. She seems rad. Okay. I'm going to go over to Tary. Hello again. I have a request of your robot. Your Doty. Am I saying this right? Your personal manservant. Could he draw some things for me? And in Common, I say back, thank you so much. Doty, would you mind drawing portraits for me? Could you draw some portraits of this group? Of Grog. Of Vax and Vex. Keyleth and Percy. Okay. So the people that I point to. Could you just draw each of them please? Shit. Okay. When you're all done, just bring them to me. Thank you so much. Just as realistic as possible. Realism. And I say, thank you, in Gnomish. In Gnome. Okay. That's all. Okay. Is he done? I'm just afraid I'm gonna (whoosh). Okay. It's okay. Thank you so much. Tary. Come here. Yes, you. Hello. So, I figured you would have a little bit of an easier time if you know the names of the people that you're spending time with. I had him make you some, I don't know, maybe some flash cards. So, I take out a quill. I hold up a photo. Who is this? I didn't realize he was going to draw them in their sleep. So, let's just-- All those things are true, but take this quill. Now, next to her picture, please write 'Keyleth'. No! No. No, no. No. You are going to write it down. Do you know how to write? Okay, I would-- What language do you prefer? Okay. Okay. So write down 'Keyleth.' The man laying next to her-- Do you know his name? I would never say that again. His name is Vax. With a 'V', as in-- Vagina. (all laugh) Next up. Okay. Next up, who's this? Yes, I know, you're learning so much. Sure! You could have it any way you like it. (all laugh) Just looking at the faces, then, who do you think they are? Ooh. I would definitely not ever say that to her. Her name is Vex. And you know that her and Vax are twin brother and sister? Okay. Now. (laughs) The man laying next to her, what is his name? Please write it down. Great. Two more to go. Who's this? Okay. You know, I think you should just continue to try to explore that. (all laugh) It would just be great just to see what happens. You never know, Tary, you just never know. I would never tell you no. No! Not me-- (all laugh) Mayhaps. Do you know my name? No. It's Pike. And last, but certainly not least-- Yes. I know. He took some artistic liberties with this one. Okay. Well, this-- -- this is Grog. Grog. And that is my very best friend. Well (laughs) thank you. That is very, very kind of you. So, before I leave, my request is that you look at these every night before bed until you learn them. Yes. So I will know if you're not looking at your flashcards every night. (all laugh) Nope. I realise that was off of memory, so I'm gonna let it slide, but yes. You do. Okay. It was wonderful to spend time with you. I'm gonna just-- I'm gonna go back over here. Goodbye. Sorry, that went a little bit longer than I thought. It's okay, I'll see you guys very soon. Yeah, back home. Jello shot? (laughs) Okay, I'll see you soon-- Quick squeeze! It's okay! I just disappeared 'cause I was in the shimmery. I was the cotton candy. You didn't hurt me at all. Yeah, but-- (all laugh) No, you didn't at all! I didn't even feel it. I just disappeared. Hi, everybody! What is this? Oh, yes! Ooh. I give him a big hug. I give him a big hug. Hello, Tary. Can I insight check him? Natural 20. I'm very proud of you. You need to continue until you know it by heart. I know. (all laugh) That's a natural 20. I love him. Yeah. Whoopsie. Grog, did you steal Percy's glasses? Oh! You did? That sounds fun. Lands and money where? I always knew you were royalty. That's the cutest thing. It would be considered saving-- you would add your saving throw wisdom? Tested? Oh, shit. We can do it. We can do it together. What do we get? Should we have Doty open it? Should we have Doty look at it? We wouldn't be able to tell. Okay. I'm going to-- -- take my quill. And I'm just gonna peek it open, just a little bit. Anything happens? Flip it open. (spooky groaning noise) Gnomish, Common, Underdark, Undercommon, Dwarvish. I can't read it. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. I'll cast Bless-- I'm gonna cast Bless on her. Oh my gosh! Can I-- Can I also cast Beacon of Hope on her? Beacon of Hope gives you advantage on wisdom saving throws. That was-- I know! I don't want to! I'm so close. I have about three and a half to four weeks. And then I'll be home for a long time. I don't know. I always hope so, but sometimes that's proven to be a little bit more difficult for some reason this season. Well, doh doh doh. It's just-- No! It's just time change and things. (all laugh) I love being here, though. Soon! So soon! How's your tummy?
