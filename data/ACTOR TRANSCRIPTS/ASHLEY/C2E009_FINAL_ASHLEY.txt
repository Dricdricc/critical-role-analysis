Oh, hi! I'm here! A little sleepy, but I'm here! Oh! Well, if it isn't my old friends. You know, I've been tracking you guys for quite some time, and I knew you were here, but I just figured I might want to get a bath first and get a rub down. Treat myself. I enjoy sometimes the finer things of life. I know, I'm sorry. I had some things to do. I found him in the woods. In a Bag of Holding. You guys are not very discreet. You're pretty easy to follow. Uh, yeah. Okay. I came for the aftermath of it, but I didn't see. Or I would have jumped in and helped, of course. Oh. I do remember you quite well. I said I was going to meet you here in Zadash. I did. I have things that I occasionally tend to, and I did. Ish. It's not that mysterious. I just have things that I have to do sometimes. Trouble? You made 60 gold in three days? Oh. How nice! What do they look like, these buttons? Your other clothing? I did hear that you've been calling yourselves something? I hear a name floating around, that you're calling yourselves the Mighty Nein? Three and a half. In a handful of days. It's neither here nor there, but just for clarification, is it Nine, as the number nine-- Okay. You look different. No. I actually don't know much about spells and things. Nice. Have you been in the water at all? Do you not like going into the water? Nott, do you know how to swim? We could hold you. What are the six deities? Yes, I do. Not here. I do not. Probably. Oh. He sounds like a great-- so many adventures. With traveling and with him. Well, I don't feel like I'm comfortable to say here-- I mean, it's underwater, but-- You stand up and it's still like-- Sometimes I have to go, but I like killing things, so sign me up. And my god, the money. Just ears alone? Wow. What is the Pillow Trove? Who's your mother? I feel like I've heard of the Ruby of the Sea. ASHLEY and Okay, I have heard of the Ruby of the Sea. That's pretty spectacular that that's your mother. How do you feel now? Are you still scared? Do you want to stand at the side then, and hold the side? Well, I know I have to be careful about some certain things. I think I'll be fine. No. I'm not in trouble for anything. I think, if anything, it would be because of the god I've chosen to follow. It's the Stormlord. I don't know if you know of him. Yes, he's pulled me out of what literally felt like the depths of hell, so I owe him my life. I will continue to serve him and do as he asks, whenever he asks. No. No. I was cold. I recall when you asked for it, it was a very cold day. I got it. You pay extra to keep your weapons. He called you a baby a lot? I'm going to wait until everyone gets out. Yeah, I just want to make sure that I get my full time's worth. I mean, I don't care to show anything. I feel like this is a pool of honesty. I just wanted to see everybody else naked first. Okay, I'm getting out. Yes. Oh, thank you, Jester. I get uncomfortable. I don't hug her back, but I gently give her one pat. I'm trying. I'm very uncomfortable with human touch. Um. Barry. (laughter) It's short for Barrymore, but I just go by Barry. Oh! D&D Beyond! Am I remembering how to do this? I'm still new. Refreshing, it's loading. Okay, 13. We've got Karen-- Yeah. Wouldn't that mean we would get 900 gold? 100 per person-- per, you know? Wait! Has anyone gone and come back? We'll take care of it. I sense a little sarcasm in you, sir. Fair enough. Maybe it came back to life? How did-- didn't you just--? I thought we took a-- Hey, I am not a person to judge. I know I don't look-- It's fine. Where are we going again? I don't know. Well, let's go kill something, yeah? Pot roast beast? The trick is to not expect anything in life. Then you'll never be disappointed, you know? On the way home from the airport! Yeah! Just a little bit.
