Is that what the 'P' stands for? I rolled a ten, total. Second attack. There we go. That's a 21. I know it's making you crazy. Path of Divine. It's ten. Do you want me to go with you? Okay, let's go. SAM and With me. I will. I know. I know. I will take care of him as best as I can. Even better than that, I will take care of him. I promise you, he will not die. I will go first. 13. Okay, do your shit. Make it a little faster than ten if you can. I will start to move the bodies. LAURA and Yes. What did you say? Flow in. Let's go. Seemingly? I'll take the next watch since I'm awake. 15. Yeah. It is? Well, I mean-- Yeah. Well, if someone has a conversation with me, I will talk to them. No, I don't think it goes as bad as you think. I mean, yes, sometimes I think it's been pretty bad even for me sometimes, watching you. But that doesn't mean-- there's always room for improvement-- I don't think I'm good at giving advice, but just talk to people if they talk to you, and be nice, you know. Eat with your mouth closed, wash your hands. Wash your hair when you can, that's fine. (dubious noise) I feel like you're still-- how do you stay dirty all the time? So you don't want people to pay attention to you. I get that. I feel that way, but I'm hard to miss. I don't mean that in a, "Woo, I'm hard to miss." Yeah. Well, I-- What? I could shave you right now with my sword. I've done it before, I like to not have hair on my arms. This is what I do. I really think that cleanliness and hygiene is very important. Okay, do you just want a trim? Is there a certain look you want? Do you want it all gone, or you just want--? It's easier to do that. I won't. I'm going to hold it like this, and then the blade-- this is how I do it. I hold it, and then I whoosh, you know? So sit here. Oh yeah, lie down. I've never done it like that, but yeah, lie down. I have done this before. Not with this, something a little smaller. Yes. You don't have to hold your breath because it will take a very long time and you'll pass out. You need to relax, breathe in, breathe out. Okay, I got it. Here we go. 16. No, I was giving him a shave. You know, if anyone else-- none of you-- Yeah, I mean, I've done it before. What did you say? I don't like that idea. Then what are we going to do with Kiri? Someone’s going to have to go make a distraction and then make it back. Do you want to leave them with Nott? Wait, that was-- okay. 16. Wow wowie wow! This is Dungeons & Dragons! 21. Might be a first. That's a first. I'm going to mosey on up over next to Beau, and I would like to rage. (air horn blaring) I'm going to pull out my blade and-- Take an attack. Give it a nice shave. That is 18. Listen, I know, I'm sorry. Where's the ones that I really like? There it is. (counting) 19. Yeah, I have a second attack. That's not going to hit. Eight. No. I scream out, yeah, Jester! I flip it off. Okay. I'm going to go over to the one by Beau. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, I had one natural 20, and then 18 was my lowest. 12 plus six. Okay, same as last time. 19 points of damage. 15. 15 points of damage. Yeah. Do I have a-- no, never mind, that's not a bonus action. Never mind, sorry. Was going to try Healing Hands. Ten. Okay. I'm going to go after this buddy here. Are we flanking him, technically? So disadvantage still? 13. Did I get it, though? Oh shit. Sorry. 14 for the first hit. Okay, that hits. Eight points of damage. I'm going to take my blade, slit it in its throat, pull its tongue through and give him a Xhorhasian necktie! (cheering) Beau, what are you at? Oh no, I can't do that. All right, could I walk over a little bit so I can stand on the-- Yeah, so I'm not in the water. Yes. 14. 12, you said? I'm, as Matt would say, looking rough. Yeah, that hits. Get out of the thing, go away. Okay, okay, okay. Oh shit. Oh, I do! That's not much better. Ten! Okay. All right. Can I get out of the water? Okay. I'll hop up back on that, out of the water there. Okay, so I'll move closer to where I think the guy is. And then I will cast Healing Hands on myself. Bring me to a whole seven. Yeah, maybe not a good idea to walk over there. Tasty treat. 18. Oh my god, okay. I’m going to hold-- I'm going to stay where I'm at. I've got nothing to attack so I'm just going to hold my turn until I, you know. Yeah, in case something shows up in the water and then I can-- But for next time, when you kill it and get a How Do You Want To Do This with it. Just in case. I'm going to go around to-- Can I flank him? Behind or somewheres? Then, you know, attack. It's not considered flanking? That's fine. Okay. Disadvantage. Okay. 18. I'm going to try. Nine. 12 for the first hit. Okay. 20? 12. Yeah. I don't think I can't do anything else. It hits. I rolled a 16 and a 21. That's just a regular attack. Nine. Yeah! See ya! Oh my god. Can we grab some of the stuff before he goes into the water? Yeah, before he sinks down. She did that and I was like, ooh! Okay, but that's still-- I'll take it. The pool that's up at the-- Swing it around. Want to hit me with it? I rolled a 13. To look for a symbol of the Stormlord. And also steal 185 gold, which we did not disburse. But what about the other sword? That was a different blade, though. It's now in your chest. Who was he? What happened to Vandrin? Yeah, how did you survive? [battle music] But how did you survive that? What kind of ship was it? Fjord, what if you try jumping in this water? What happens if you look over, do you see yourself? I have a tinderbox. Can I take down the bodies that are on the trees? Leave them to rest in peace. So that people know that we took care of it. So it's not a danger anymore. Yeah, food. It's the circle of life. Pat, pat. It was good. I mean, that is 100 gold. Was that for everyone? No, it's fine.
