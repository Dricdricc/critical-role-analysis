You're welcome! (singing) A dick in a box. I'll hold your hand! Eyes closed, holding my holy symbol! Had to add it. But that would probably be really hard to just get right into that spot. I'd like to attune to my frostbrand sword. And then we all lay down and go to sleep! Yeah, yeah. I'm done attuning? Yeah, I just found you guys, just hanging out. You need some help? Yeah, let me help you, I'm so strong. Did you ask him if he's going to help us? Vax. Is he going to help dig the trench? Vex, can I have one of your arrows? I want to make it real special. Okay, so I grab one of her arrows and I cast Glyph of Warding on one of her arrows. I think just one. Okay. I thought it was going to work. It was going to be real cool. An explosive rune. So can we hide it in the loot? Okay. I'll find something in the loot, some little chest or something that I can put it in. When he gets-- if he starts to fly away. If he removes something on top of it. But also if he grabbed it. Okay. So if it flies-- So it can't be if he just touches it? If he tries to leave. Yeah. Even like this much? If it's just moved. I want to do cold damage. I'm going to go cold damage. I'm going to cast it at fifth level. 17. Why is he doing his eyebrows up and down? If it's a chest, can we put some coins sticking out of it? So it looks like it's full? No, you don't. You'll get it back. With a bow on it. You'll get it back. No, I'm just saying you'll get it back. Are we near any structures or any houses? Are there any magic-users in the room? I have Shield of Faith that I can put on somebody. It's up to ten minutes. I can do it tomorrow. 12. Say it one more time. Do you want to have it for the night? Sure. So each target's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by five for the duration. Cast it at-- fifth is the highest that I have now. Yeah, let's do it. That's, yeah. Yeah, do you want it for tonight? Yeah, it'll go away. Let's wait. Right when I wake up, I am going to try Divine Intervention. Yeah. I don't know. No, it's never worked. That's something else. That wasn't intervention. It's never worked. To come help us kill a dragon. So that. What do I have-- I do. Is this the percentile? What do I need to roll? I rolled an 80. It never works! Dammit. I don't feel her warmth, though. Just go eat. I'm going to run up to Scanlan and I'm going to cast Death Ward on him. I'm going to cast Protection from Energy, acid, onto Vax. I'm going to cast it onto Vex. Oh, yeah. Yes. I'm going to cast Aid on Keyleth. Fourth. Scanlan, again. Okay, I have low hit points. I'll do it on myself. 15? I'm going to save my spells. I'm going to-- wait, Grog, where are you? Is that where I am? I want to be in the trenches. I'm just going to hide. I'm not going to be a hero. They'll see me shining with my shiny armor. Did he move the treasure? 13. I'm looking for the popcorn ones. Okay. I'm going to Guiding Bolt. I'm going to-- at third. Let me see this. And then I add that? That would be a 29. I rolled a 19. Okay, so now I do-- 26. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to stay. But I'm also going to put a Spiritual Weapon, just a sword again. Can't think of anything right now because I'm nervous. Three. 19. I'll stay where I am. Yes. Is there anything extra from heroes' feast? No? Oh, I have one. Yeah. Did he never land on the glyph? It was if he landed on it. All right. So. I'm going to Guiding Bolt him again. 28? I'm rolling what again? Sorry. Four again. I have two more. The last Guiding Bolt. Two. Because the ring gives me one extra. At fourth level, that would be seven, then. 22. But I'll also-- never mind. We're good, 22. And then I'm going to move my Spiritual Weapon. And I'm going to move it to the back of his neck. Okay. Can it get his feet? All right, well, it'll start working its way up there. Wait, what is this? Is this an attack? Can I cast War God's Blessing? Probably not. Plus ten. Yeah. Nope. No. Doesn't hit. And I'm staying up there? No! I am going to cast Blindness on him. I think it's constitution. Constitution saving throw. You don't know! That's fine. I'm going to move my Spiritual Weapon. 29. 1d8 for every two slot levels-- Nine. Spits you both up, maybe. Maybe you got a little air though. For you. Probably give you enough time to (inhales). What? 18. Ten. I'm going to use my celestial shield and cast Featherfall. Can I use War God's Blessing again? I use it every turn. Every round. Let's do it. What was that, say again? Get him! Who's not here next week? Why are you guys going?
