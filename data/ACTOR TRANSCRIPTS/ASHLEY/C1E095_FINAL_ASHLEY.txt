What are these? Actually, a lot of people tell me that I look like him anyway. Him or-- I get-- From the '80s band, it's a guy. Justin George? I can't think of a song. I'll think of it. I wish we were going to the North Pole. We are going to Mexico! We're going to a place. Never. We've almost been dating for five years and we've never gone on a vacation together. Boy George! Boy George! I get it a lot. I get that. You have an actual set? I say, at the end of all this, we all pick one. Huzzah! All right. So I followed, in the beginning-- did the guy pick the Deck in Vasselheim? Or were you-- MATT AND So I went with Grog to Vasselheim. And because I wanted to go and read and work on some things-- Yes. I ended up fighting (laughs) because I saw him fight, and I was like, oh, I should probably just try it! And did well. I'm the second champion under Grog. Do it. No! To fight! We didn't end up doing it. We just shook-- -- and I would win. So we just decided not to do it. Two monsters of a feather. Also, in that time, which was a five-month period, we had a lot of lessons and taught Grog how to read. Just a little bit. Wait, what did you ask? I'm so tired! I took some time to learn how to be just a little bit more stealthy. Just did a little bit of training. Not a ton, but maybe, we'll see. I also went to check on great-great-grandpappy Wilhand to see how he was doing, and he's doing fine. He's older. Oh, of course. Always. I've totally forgot about Fassbender! Didn't he die? Oh shit, I forgot about Fassbender. He's keeping him safe. He probably helped build the house. That's okay. It was technically his. I also sent a little bit of money to -- I don't know where they are, but I hired somebody to send a letter and some money to some of my family. Yeah. And what else? Oh, last, but certainly not least, we opened up a bakery. It's called-- tell 'em. And we have many, many items. Sun Treats. Bear Claws. Angel Food Cake. So many treats and treasures. So Tary, Keyleth, Vex and I just decided on a drunken evening, we were like, we should open up a bakery! It does. Yeah. I did try looking for Scanlan at one point. But I couldn't find him. Yeah. Yes. And what was the last thing. Oh, we went to go see-- -- something great. Yeah. So that's what I did on my year of break. You are so great at baking. What did we name the profiteroles again? Your hair is lovely. You're kind. You're very giving. Yeah. Because I've sailed there before. I'll teach you the ropes. (laughter) Okay. (laughter) Okay, just kidding. I don't say that. Oh, man. Yes. Do you have any specials? AAA discounts, tenth night free situation? How about some free drinks? I used to come here on a ship and we used to bring you guys a lot of supplies, so, you know. (gasping) 31. It's 12. Maybe, how about-- If we don't get free food, what about-- Two. 14. Okay. Tokens! Thanks! Ooh! Are you going to join? I want to. I got a five. I definitely didn't find a pearl. I rolled a five. I found a boob. Oh. You should go change. I want to get my hair braided with beads on the end! (cheering) And Grog. Hi. Could we get our hair-- yours looks amazing. Could we get some hair braids? Tight and then going down, with some gems and sparkles in it? And same here, on his beard? Yeah? It looks really good. Do you want to add any jewels in it? Earrings and stuff like how she has? I want all of it. Just all of it. What does all of it cost? Well, no. Let's not get carried away. My hair is already so long. Let's put blue in there. Oh, well-- Yeah! So how does that break down? For my hair versus his? Well, you know what? I am a very big supporter of small businesses, so support small business, and I will give you 120 gold. Great. Just 120. Say again? Just some strips, you know. Just some strips on the white so it pops out. Just like-- You know, dealer's choice. Just get creative and do what you want. It's awesome. Ooh, that's pretty cool. Weren't you in the shower? It's so good! Hello? Oh, come in! Okay. (laughter) Yes? Ooh? Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. (gasps) Naturally. Yeah. (gasps) So something magic comes out of it when you pick one? Can I pick one? Yeah. Wait, it can be dangerous? Okay. Oh. Okay. What! That sounds like the best thing ever. The Crossroads. (gasps) Should we-- Whoa. Should we pick a card? Wait, what do you mean this sword gave you a headache, Grog? Was it evil? Okay, that's a-- That's a red flag. So it didn't talk back to you. It fought on its own. A guy that you met, you made him just rich and amazing. A Deck of Fortune? I mean, I don't, yeah. I don't know if I have the knowledge, but I'll look at it. Natural 20. (cheering) Plus one. So 21. Can I tell which cards are good and which cards are bad? I was just checking. (laughter) I feel like I've heard of something like this before. But sometimes you can choose a card that will do very bad things. So it's like a 50/50 chance that you could get something very good. Like, you have your fortune change, you become a king, all of this thing-- Or you get a magical sword. Or if maybe someone-- you could just die instantly. I don't know, maybe. Something along those lines. (strained) Oh, it just sounds so fun though. (strained) Oh, I don't know what to do. Well, do you want to pull one or should I pull one? Or should we not? What could be that bad? I mean, if someone were to die, we could do a Resurrection spell. (sighs) I don't know what to do. I don't know if we should. I don't know if we should test the fates. Let's flip a coin. Yeah, I have a coin. Okay. Heads or tails. Okay, so one is heads. Okay. So what's what? 20, we pick a card. One, we do not. 20, we don't pick a card. You are not here. That's both of those. You said we'd pick a card both sides. Yeah. One, we pick a card. 20, we don't. Who picks the card? Or should we-- Okay, okay, I'm going to check it. Oh, we don't pick a card. Okay. Oh. You don't pick a card either. You know what? It's safer this way. I think so. Because what if we would've gotten something bad? Did you want me to hold onto it? Or do you want to hold onto it? I'm just afraid you're going to pick it and be alone. Do not. Pick it. Alone. Who did you make the promise to? Well, you live your life how you want to-- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Just take a peek? (strained) I want to so bad. I know. Yes? Where? Okay. Yes. Okay. Yes. That was awesome! It's okay. It's been so long. How did you know where to find me? I give her a hug. It's good to see you. It's been a very long time. Did you guys just come here to see me? I'm right here! Hi. How are you? It's so wonderful to see you. I'm here. Yes, I did. With my friends. Who I would love to introduce you guys to. My friends? My friends! I also-- I also have a bakery! It's called the Slayer's Cake! Come this way. I didn't realize you guys would be coming, but I'm glad that you got my letter and everything else. Oh. Well, no one right now. We'll discuss later, maybe, but do come in. I would love to introduce you to some friends of mine. Come into town. Yes. Just walk us into town. That would be great. Just in case there's anything that might jump out and get us. Let me-- you know what? Guards, can you take them to the Slayer's Cake? And I will be right there. Hey. Okay, so you just saw that. My family's here, the family I haven't really seen since I was a kid, and they're-- we have the last name Trickfoot for a reason. I'm going to get on the earring and say, whoever is available, I would love to maybe have you come to the Slayer's Cake. Some of my family is here. Hold on! Watch your pockets, watch your stuff. Just keep an eye on your things. Yeah, just please come? Okay, I sent money. I didn't tell them where I was. I did. I don't know, maybe I shouldn't have done it. I just wanted to make sure that they were okay. Maybe that wasn't a good idea. Because they're-- I left when I was very young, so a lot of them I don't really know. Okay. Thank you. Okay. I don't think it'll come to that. Right. Okay. Just get ready. Let's go to the Slayer's Cake. They alluded to the fact that they know who Vox Machina is, which I guess in this day and age, people know who we are. Which is weird. Okay, just be prepared, because it's not like I'm embarrassed of my family or anything, I just-- they're great! I just don't really know them. Okay, Wilhand took me out of there when I was six, so it's been a while. Not really? JB, my cousin who you'll meet in a little bit, but not really. Not really at all. No, they have so many things to do. Busy. But just hold onto your butts. Hold onto your things. They are sneaky. Sneaky-sneaky. They like to take things, and they're fast and small and that little sleight-of-hand didn't get passed down to me, but-- oh, I'm so uncomfortable right now! Thanks. Yeah. Oh, I see you got some blondies. I mean, just don't get sick by having too many pastries. This is-- guys? Everybody? This is my family. This is part of my family. Well, I'm so glad you did. How in the world did you find out that I was here? It's good to see you. Well-- Are you guys just passing through? Where's your next destination? JB? Can I talk to you for just a minute? Just step outside on the outdoor bench. Oh, thank you. It's very good to see you. How have you been? I know. I understand that. How are my parents? No. None taken. Can I insight check her? Oh no. 13? Okay. Well. Have you guys, in your travels-- you know who Scanlan Shorthalt is, I'm sure? He's not around. He definitely has. Yes. Such a scoundrel. All right, well, let's go back inside. Me, too. Yeah. Oh, well, we don't need to keep saying these things. You know, if you guys would like to stay just for a few days, because we're going to be leaving. We have a lot of stuff to do. I think we have a thing that we have to go fight, and we have so many things that we have to do. We have some things planned. No, no. Okay. Well, why don't you guys stay in my place, and I'll take care of you guys while you're here? Just explore the town, and when we're getting ready to go, I'll let you know, and you guys can go on your merry way. Okay. It's just so great. Well, you can stay at my place. Okay. Yeah, let's have dinner. Hi. It's so good to see you. Thank you, Uncle Ogden. Well, should we get some dinner? Are you guys hungry, or have you filled up on pastries? Okay, great. Well, let's have a delicious dinner. For the meat pies. We can-- (sighs). We'll go freshen up for dinner. Uncle could use a bath, I know. All right. I'll walk you guys. Let's walk to my place. Oh god, it's so awkward! I just don't know. Thank you, Percy. I'll let you know if there's anything that I need. Which one? Because they're all odd. Okay. That's a great idea. So this is all of you, then, that came? You guys have been traveling around, just yourselves? Yeah. Oh. Well, is there anything you would like to see while you're here? Okay. Well, is there anyone in particular you would like to give you a tour? All right, come with me. You can come to my place, freshen up before dinner, and we'll have a great time. That's a good idea. That's a great idea. Okay. We might have to wait a little bit. (chuckles) It sure is. Sure. Why don't you take a seat, and order whatever you want, on me. Just great. I run over to Percy really quickly. (whispering) Percy? I just wanted to... apologize in advance for whatever may happen in the next few days. Okay. Okay. Okay. Again, I'm not embarrassed. Yeah. Yeah, they do. Oh great. Okay, I'll join you. I take a big gulp. All the gulps. (grunts) It does. Let's go eat. This is comfort food in Whitestone. Is this my castle? Trish the Dish. I'm going to sit next to Ogden. JB, I can feed him for a little bit if you'd like to look around or something, or talk to anybody here? Who do you really want to talk to? Is there someone in Vox Machina that you really love? Okay. Well, I'm sure she would love to talk to you. She's very inviting, very friendly. Sure. I start speaking to him in Underdark because I haven't spoken that in a while. Ogden? How are you liking traveling with everybody? With Johann and Astra and JB? Underdark. It's Undercommon? Okay. Protect me from what? What do you mean? Okay. Are these just dreams? I take a spoon of peanut butter. It's a little bit easier. Here you go. Yep. Sorry, the mix between the pork and peanut butter. It's an interesting mix, but it's Grog's favorite. It's a good mix! Can you tell me about Astra? How did she come into the picture? There you go. And any word from my family? My mother, anything? It's been a long time since I talked to them. That makes sense. Yep. Okay. I can have someone take him, if you'd like to stay? Well. Yeah. You would like to stay with him? Great. Okay. Okay, I will. Check your pockets. Well, he's all I've known and he's wonderful. He's my family, since I left, and I'm sorry I haven't really contacted you guys. Yeah. Well, so you've been taking care of Ogden? Has he told you anything that he dreams about? Yes. Okay. Can I insight check her again? I can't figure out what's going on. Ugh, balls. Oh, wait. 16? Okay. Well, how's everybody feeling? Are you tired? Are you full? Is it bedtime? What's going on? Well. Oh man. Okay. Check your pockets! Check your pockets. Yes. Yeah, but I mean, I haven't seen them in a very long time. Since I was but a kid. Well, because he was different and had a different life plan and because he became a cleric and was the first of-- I don't know how far back. I don't even know. Yeah. And he saw that I was and decided-- we left. He took me when I was little, and we left. There was a lot that happened, but I didn't know where they were because they travel. I don't know. I heard some things with some discussions I had tonight, and I need to figure out if they're true or not. We'll figure out in the next few days, just to see what's going on. How do you know about that? You did? What did he say? Yes, this is a thing. Okay. He didn't talk about the family. He wanted to be separate from them and he didn't want me to be influenced by them at all. Maybe both. Can we, from here? We could. As you guys know, Wilhand is a little-- he's in his older years. But we could try to keep it quick. Wilhand's older than Ogden. Let's circle back tomorrow. And while they're doing the tour, maybe we can pop over real quick and I think that would be better than him seeing them here. Yeah. They would be pretty fascinated by that. I will. I'll just be a little late. Yeah.
