Here I am! Well, hey, guys! I just came to hang out. It's the best. Full circle! They're like little best friend charms. I love this little plush. (singing) The more you know! And there were so many good ones. It was so hard. Time to get some... tail. I was going to say something else and then I realized-- Not sure where that came from. Cyrano de Bergerac! Don't we have a gatestone? I'm sorry! I didn't want to stay. Yes! Okay, bye! Hi, buddy! Oh, wow. Well maybe we can take it. Where is she? Sorry. Did I come in at a bad time? I'm sorry, Grog. Oh no. Well, let's fix it. I had to come. The Feywild, you know? I know we just said bye, but I had to come. All right, let's do this. Hi. I remember you. (stammering) I didn't mean to startle you. I didn't know everyone was in the middle of something. I do apologize again for startling you. I think I could give it a go, with some things. (quietly) Yeah. Bye, Nala. We should fix you. All right. Okay. I don't know. That's why I'm a little nervous. Yeah, a blind sharpshooter might not be the best in the Feywild. I would throw it out there. No, I think it's okay. Get my way up Trinket and cast Greater Restoration. You see? Does he still have Barkskin? 14. Any critters? LAURA and Did you hear something? This is fun, though. No. I'm done. I'll ride Trinket. I give Trinket a scratch where it makes him go weird and start scratching his neck. Sorry, buddy. I think we're all learning. This is so great. Oh no! What about getting his hair done with flowers and braids and bows? Same. I'm sitting on Trinket, wiping away tears. Good call. Can I perception check? 14. No one's following us! (singing) Whispers in the night! What's your name? What was it? What are you reading? What are you reading? That's the best face ever. Can I pat him down for any weapons? Nine. We can make you a new one somewhere. Maybe a baby panther. I want one. I don't want any zoo animals. Well, it'll disappear if you take it. Can I insight check Percy? Because he's acting a little strange. Yeah, but I didn't get anything. I'm sure we could find you a quill. Can I take his ocarina? Just for the night? He's asleep, so do I get advantage or something? Natural 20. I look over at Vax and give him a wink. And Vex! Thanks. He never told us what he wanted you to get, what he wanted to steal. Do you feel different? Do you feel different? How long does that take? It takes a week? To memorize it? How close? I'm going to get up early, but yeah. Yes. Follow me to the kitchen. I put down a cup of coffee for him, and I run into the kitchen and get a very large-- oh no. What's wrong? It's coffee? Oh. What do you want? Okay. Can we get him something that's not coffee? Apple juice will be great. I run in the kitchen really quick and get a very large piece of butcher paper. Okay. So. Garmelie. I think you're so talented, and I wanted to ask if maybe you could draw a family portrait for us. The most ridiculous you can make it. Just of all of us. I want to hang it above the mantel before everybody wakes up. Yeah, fill in the details. Vax gave you a quill last night. Oh, I forgot. I think there's one in the kitchen. Okay. Can you use charcoal? Great. Have at it. Sure. And remember, very ridiculous. I just wanted to hear you explain it. So I'm going to take it and I'm going to paste it above the mantel. I'm going to go back upstairs to my room. 15. I love it. Wait. I had a feeling. You never told us what you wanted. What are you doing with your hands? Can I take out his ocarina and play a couple of notes while I'm looking at him? Yeah, right. 13. Thanks. I learned once. Maybe we'll give it back to you, but I know what you did to my friend with this little thing, so I'm not going to give it back to you. Not just yet. Already did. I'm going to walk over to Scanlan. Scanlan! I'm going to give this to you. Yeah. Because I don't like performing. That's a lie. Just take this and maybe you can charm some people with it. I don't know if that's what it is, but I don't want him to have it. All right. Let's go. 15. I felt like we were just getting started. How? I wish I could. Oh, I noticed.
