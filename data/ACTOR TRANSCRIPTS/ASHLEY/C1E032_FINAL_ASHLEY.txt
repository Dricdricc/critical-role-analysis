Yes. Oh, you know, it's just really cold and rainy, but it's good. It's good. I've missed you guys so bad. So much! (laughter) He told me five minutes ago, and he told me what was going on, and I was like, "I'm back, "can I play?" He said, "Yeah you can play. Let me plan real quick." Wait, what the heck? How much money? (laughter) What? I saw the check on my iPad, and I thought it said 15. I was like, "Wow, that's so "much money. Holy crap!" There's an extra one in front of that. (laughter) Maybe it'll ship to New York? (laughter) Oh yeah, I wish were there in person. But soon. I got all my gear. I'm so nervous and so excited. I feel like I don't know how to play anymore! Yeah. Hi! No, you're still alive. Oh gosh. It's a long story. I don't know if we can talk about it right now. (laughter) Let's talk later. Kick some ass! Come on, let's go! Can I jump off of the wall? Yeah. I can? Okay. I want to try... I want to see what happens if I cast Turn Undead. Oh man. Okay. Let's do it. I want to see it. I want to see what it does. What check was it? MATT, LAURA, AND What do I roll, again? I rolled a seven. Okay, hold on. I'm so sorry, you guys. I roll a 20? And I rolled a ten. I rolled a ten. Hold on. Natural 20! Yeah! (laughter) It is 16. I just keep hearing a thud. Thunk. What?! (laughter) I can't believe I rolled a natural 20 on my first roll. So happy, you guys. It won't happen for the rest of the game. Do it! Do it! Yeah! I give Grog an air-high-five. What did you say it was? Yeah, I do. I always want to help somebody. I don't know; what do you think? Okay. Okay, I'll Cure Wounds. I'll do 3rd. (garbled) 23. No, I'm not, I-- I help him up. Okay. Wait, I cut out right when you said, was that guy bad? Okay. Okay, good. I got a six. Wait, I rolled a six! It's already my turn? Okay. So I'm going to Guiding Bolt. That guy. Or wait, is anybody-- where are you at? All right. 17. I'll cast it at a four. 24. Yes. Where am I, sorry? I can't see very well. I'll stay. Okay. Where are you at, Scanlan? Health-wise, where are you at? Okay, so I'm going to go up to the giant, where the open wound is, where that guy just broke it open. I have Sprinter's Boots, if I can't get all the way up to it. Okay, I'll use Sprinter's Boots. I'm going to use my mace, and I'm going to start ripping where that wound is. Okay, so I roll-- Roll the d20 twice? 17. That's the higher of the two. I had a seven and a 17. Nine. Wait, am I supposed to add something? Shit. Sorry, guys! Oh, 17 again! I think it's 1d6 plus three. Plus seven if it's an attack hit. I do. Shit. No, I don't have the papers. Guys, someone took it from me. Wait, so one more time? You said 3d6? Fuck. Okay. Can I use my d10? An additional d10 from Scanlan, for the inspiration? I'm getting carried away. Okay. 23. Oh, shit. I forgot the second hit! Sorry! Sorry, guys watching. Sorry. Oh, I've missed you, too. 21. Okay, I'm back. Oh my gosh. Okay, I want him to just explode with a radiant glow. (laughs) Oh boy. What the heck? Well, as you guys know, I've been working at the temple and it's been very hard work. (laughs) And I, I just, I think about you all constantly, and every day, I felt a heaviness, and I've had these visions of terrible things, and I felt a disturbance in the Force. (laughter) I received a letter! (laughter) That was a very long pause. Well, most of my... my heaviness and visions were about you. I've been in deep prayer and meditation, and I know you guys were in a very dark place, and I prayed that Sarenrae would send me to you. And so here I am, sort of as an avatar, but I'm here, and I want to help in any way that I can. I just know something's off, and I don't quite know what that is yet. I don't know. This is the first time that I've ever done this, so I'm hoping that it will last a long time, at least to see you through. (fake crying) Yeah. We're still in the open, right? I rolled a ten. Ten. I did. Are there two openings? The one that we came in, and then the rest of the tunnel? Could I put a Guardian of Faith above us before we make our-- I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. (laughs) I go over to Percy. Percy, how are you? Oh boy. Okay. Can I do any extra check on him? Did anybody already do a medicine check? All right. I'll give it a go. 17. (sighs) Okay. Lesser Restoration, would that do anything in this situation? Okay. I can try it. Can I try it? Okay. I'll do Greater. Do you mind, Percy? What is a corruption point? (laughs) How many do you have? Sorry. I'm asking too many questions. How do you feel, Percy? I just tried to find out what this is. This is going to sound like a very weird question, but does part of you want to hold onto some of this? Okay. Chilling. I don't have that ability. I don't know if I've-- Let me check. Oh dang. I haven't even looked through these yet. Wow. There's some amazing-- just a side note, there's one called Heal that can heal a person 70 hit points. Just like that. Yeah, let's do the Heroes' Feast, then. Oh, thanks! (sneezes) LAURA AND Yeah. 19. I rolled an 18 and my strength modifier is one. Whoa, Scanlan. Me too, I'm super stealthy. (laughs) I have three. (sighs) No, I feel weird about this old woman. Did you guys give her something to eat? Did she eat it? We didn't see her eat it? I'm going to go with Grog. Can I quietly prick a little hole into my palm, just so I can start bleeding a little bit? Just very tiny? What was that? Fuck. I just want to see if she's a vampire. All right, Grog, maybe? Wait, who's Ripley? (laughter) I'll try to catch up, too. Wait, we're stopping? My pick up is at 5AM. It's almost 2AM. Ah, shit. All right, I love you guys so much. Okay. Bye! MARISHA and I know, hopefully, hopefully. Love you guys. LAURA and
