I'm drinking out of your mug. Are we still on? Still going? Wait, can we show someone that's here that's really cool? Do it on the break. Whoa. Grog, it's sparkling. It's sparkling! Hey, I feel it. It's like sandpaper, a little bit. Is it just violence? (sings) I whip my beard back and forth. Oh. Hey, that's rude. Is magical ability inversely proportionate to wisdom? Hey. Hey. That was amazing. Oh, math! That was awesome. Oh. (laughs) Oh, wow. It's like you have a halo. Oh, wow. Well, I don't know if that's what it means. It is very cool-looking. We cool, Sarenrae. Ooh. (whispers) Fire Ashari? Oh, you'll do it. You'll totally do it. But it's very charming. This is very heavy. Yes. Oh, we went shopping. We had a girl shop day. Wow, and you're-- And you're so well-girded. I'm Pike. May I insight-check Yonn? What did you get, Liam? Okay. I got 15. None of Sarenrae. The best, the best one. Sarenrae! You look really great in gold. I'll just stay right on the path. But there are forests here. Oh, Taliesin's here. Yeah, do it. Oh no. Oh. She's with us. She's with us, she was just outside, we got in before. Wow. That was cool. It's just-- there's a lot of holiness here. (laughter) Probably six. This temple, I mean this-- Just this whole land in particular. I mean there's a lot, there's a lot here, but-- Yes, good. I think I'm okay to keep going. But maybe later. We'll see. If I get a little tired. (quietly) Excuse me. We're all healed. Get it, girl. Get it, girl. Get it. Yeah. (laughs) Are we going to return for it? No, you didn't. Okay. Should we run through? I start running. What?! Dexterity check? Three. But I'm short! I'm so short. They would-- They would just flow right over me. I got 24 points. We run through it. Sagey rosemary? Oh snap. Yeah, 20. You're going to hurt your foot again, Vax. Yeah, come on, Vex. Oh, no! Get it, get it, get it, you're going to do it. No, but it's already gone in. Yeah. Yeah, Vex! What are you studying at Harvard? Go donate. Just do it! What? Spiders! She can do so much more than just arrows! Ugh. Natural 20. (yelling) I'm gonna go with it. Nothing. Last. (yells) Vax! Okay, how far can I move up to use a Spiritual Weapon? I can't tell where I'm at. I'm sorry, I didn't wear my glasses. Okay, so I would like to cast a golden spiderweb of thorns. And encase the spiders. Like a thorny net. I'm just making it look really pretty. Basically. It wouldn't do any damage, it would just contain them? Even if they're thorny? Even like holy thorns? Oh. All right, you know what? Okay. Contain them. Contain them and then somebody could just-- Throw fire, a fireball at them. Okay. 12. All right, all right! Yes? Oh, go through, go through, go go go! Tag you in! Tag you in! Because they live underground. There's no sunlight. That's not depressing at all. That bonus is awesome. Yes. What are you at? Okay. I guess we all need some-- what's everybody else at? Um, hold on. Let me heal you up, Percy, hold on. Nine, Percy. Percy, 18. Going in. Yeah, I'll go in. I'll go in close to Grog. Ugh. I'm going to do the same thing. Yeah, what's the level two? Both sides? While she's looking, could I-- You found it. Well done. Do you want to go one up top, just in case? Rad. Same, same, same. Following. I don't? Three. (laughter) (whispers) Sorry! Sorry! Oh! That's good. 14. Ah, go, go! 17? Natural 20! 24. All right, do some people need to be healed? 25 points of healing. I will gladly look into it. (whispers) Wow. Yes... No no no! I take out my symbol and I say, no no no, I'm here to help. (tearfully) Yes. Oh, man, I don't want to leave you guys. Well, I think this is a pilgrimage I have to take. So, Vox Machina, keep your eyes out. I will contact you every once in a while if I can, and we will meet up once this is completed. All in. Vox Machina on three. One, two, three. I'm going to miss you guys very much. You guys have been so amazing and have made this experience even better for us, and thank you so much for going with us on our journey. It will keep going, but I will be back when I can. But it might be a long time. I'm going to miss you guys. Personal journey. I will. Okay, Scanlan. Okay. Definitely limited edition.
