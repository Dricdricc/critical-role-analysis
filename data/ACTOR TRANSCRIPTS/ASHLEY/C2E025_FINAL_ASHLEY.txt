We love you, Travis and Laura! Ah, yes! Yay! I can see the-- Me too! Still, if they get across. So was anyone else left in there with it? That it maybe didn't kill or-- That's fine by me. Like a uniform of some sort? She probably is. I really like meat pies. Well, we might need a couple. Oh. I will certainly try, this does seem like a very-- Wait, what's the difference between baking and industrial grade? We could also put a meat pie in the-- Did you babysit a lot as a kid, Caleb? Is this how you know so much? Please take it off! Make a distraction? Yeah, I could have you stand on my shoulders. Okay. Ready? Yeah. Get ready-- Great. Are you going to go in or are you just going-- Razzle dazzle? Can I aid him-- okay. Ooh. I'm going to do a little side by side walking to make it look like he's-- Hopefully that will do something. I guess we head to the prison. I'll take it. Yeah. Okay. I want to get a good look at it, but this sounds like a fun challenge. She has used two 2nd-level spells? Which was--? Yes, of course. Yes. Good idea. Here. This is as, you know, I've heard the kids say these days Creepy AF. That's sucks. Yep. Three Amigos? We're going to hide behind the rubble. And Beau as well. You did? It is going to be very special. Thank you, Molly. Plan B. That's fine. Can we put Jester in the corner? 19. I don’t know! But I don't know what to do this early on. Okay, I would like to rage. It's the time. Do I just go in? Can I get to it? Oh no. I didn't reckless. 11. Divine Fury, can you do it on the first or only if the first-- That first attack that hits. Can I use my extra attack? That’s better. That’s 21. Okay! 12. Yeah. Plus three. It’s 2d6 plus three. Yeah. So 12. Oh right! Yeah, 14. No, because that’s only the first. Okay! So an extra d6. Oops. Okay, an extra two. So 16 total. Okay. I’ll stay. Say again? Rolled a 21. Okay, okay, okay. Oof. Oh. Nine. I rolled the wrong ones. Is that halved because I’m raging? That’s a total of-- you said three and-- I’m sorry. Five points of damage, okay. 25 points of damage? Hey, that's a classic. That's a 26. Okay. Come on, Jester. Any pluses? 14. Okay. So I'm going to (stuttering) pick myself up. Can I flank? Get around so Beau and I are-- yeah. Right. That's right. 22. 16. Oh, okay. So I get another attack? That does not have advantage, right? That's a 25. Not an extra, because not Divine Fury? Okay. That's 11. Damn it! So he did think of that! He put that in his notes! Lying sack of shit. I'm also in proximity. So the Spiritual Weapon? Yeah, I say give it a go. 15. Okay, I am going to attack with my-- All right, so, question? I would like to try to use the Dispel Magic portion of my Magician's Judge. I don't know; is that bad? Okay, I'm going to wait. 19. Okay. 17 points. I would like-- Does that also have advantage, or no? Okay, ooh! 22. 16. Yes. I get one? Isn't she behind the door? You’re unconscious? Jester took a full 27? Jester runs up and casts Cure Wounds. At 1st-level, because I feel like that's what she would do. Yeah? Oh, yes, yes. I go over and I-- here. If this big thing couldn't kick it in, how could I? Okay, I'll come and try to open the door. What? It's not going to budge. May I go over and see the room where this thing was staying in, on the other side? I think it is. 11. Couple questions. I really like some of the armor pieces that he has on his shoulders, like with the skulls and things. Is that just part of his-- Okay. I got you. As I'm holding her-- --I will cast Healing Hands. Regain number of hit points equal to your level. So you gain an extra five hit points. A whole five. It really was. Oh no! What a bunch of assholes. Oh my goodness. Scratch those feathers. Goodbye, Kiri. We will send you treasures from all of our travels. We will miss you very much. It sure did. Stews. Yeah? Why would you think that? Well, I'm not at this moment. I think-- and if I did, I would find my way back to you. Sometimes things need to be done. Thank you, Caleb. I think you can manage just fine, but I will-- I'm here for now. What a strange feeling. I'll join you. Yeah. I am, too. I'm actually very surprised at the choices we've made. Especially the choices that I've made. Sorry, Jester. That’s a very nice way to put it. "I’ve never been to the Coast." I’ve seen-- I rolled 11. Natural 20. Am I--? I take out my weapon and I’m ready to go. Yes. Okay. 25. 18? Oh, that’s a nine. 13? Can I try to scream out in some way to the Stormlord? Three. Are my legs still free? Can I kick? 25. 17. Eight. I spit in his face. Fuck. Yup. This was too much! Kiri and then this? My heart. Just a little. Love you. I’ll hop in when I can. What? Yep. I know. But Skyping isn’t the same, yeah? Thank you, Liam! No!
