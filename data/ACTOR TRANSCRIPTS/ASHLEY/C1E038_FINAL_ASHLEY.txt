Okay, well, I'm going to walk over to him. Just stay still. It's better on the light side, so hold on. Yeah, because maybe he'll remember and tell us. Okay. Wait. Am I doing Greater Restoration? Let's try it! Should I do it? Wait, what happened to him? Oh man, I so badly want to fix that sword to save Grog, but at the same time, I don't! (laughter) Yeah. We should go heal. Like "Hogwarts" without the G? Yeah, close. No, I said it's pretty close. Gilmore! I'm listening. I'm listening. Gilmore! Oh wait, I want one, then! 18. Wait. Okay, I want to help Keyleth out because she's-- yeah. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Hold on. Go ahead. Yeah. Can I cast Lesser Restoration on her? All right, let's do it. Just to give her still a little bit of a buzz. To just take the bad part out of it. Come here, come here. Oh man, I love this game. Did I hear what? (laughter) Can I insight check him?

So in addition to the 20? I rolled a six. One. Okay. I rolled a nine. Wait! 16! 16! I give his pick back to him. And I say it was just luck, Vax. Good boy.

Do I get that invisibility cloak again? Yeah, can I give it a-- what do you see inside the gem? Yeah, can I give it a look? I want to look at the tea set too. Can I do a check? I don't know, like if it's-- I don't know. I don't know what to check. Yeah well I want to check if it's evil, but I don't know. It seems like it is. I have it, I have it, I have it, I have it! Let me do that. Yep, it's right in here. Okay. I think that's okay. I think-- that's fine. Okay. I think it's bad. Let's have it face the wall. I don't want it looking at us. Grog. The frozen man is obviously dead. Did I freeze? I'm sorry. I would like to see if I could cast Speak With Dead and ask some questions. Melting around his mouth.
