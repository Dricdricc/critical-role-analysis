It's true. Hey! LAURA and Can I-- do I see them? Gatestone! I pull it out of my bag. Pass it to her. She can read lips! So we can see Grog? Are they all falling? Yeah, you would. Yeah. Make the eagle follow. What's goatball? Wait, what did you just say? Oh. Yes. Realized it as I was saying it. What if I just heal everybody and we keep on? I don't want to lose the damage that's on him. I'm going to cast Mass Cure Wounds on everybody. Everybody is healed 27. I hop on an eagle. Scanlan. Yes. Yay! 29. What?! (laughter) Well, I do declare I'm invisible. Of stealthing? I want to do a hand. (laughter) Grog. Well, we all did. But it wasn't this big. It was pretty-- it was a lot bigger than me. 12. Sorry, Grog. I thought I would be stronger, but I'm still not. Yes, I am. That brought me to 12. (laughter) What's going on down there? (laughter) I walk up. Yes. Is it magic--? SAM and That's just old. (laughter) I have Dispel Magic, but I wonder if we should use it. But that's one of my last spells! I'm so still. 18. Oh! War God's Blessing. Wait! I think I cast Resistance. I cast it on Keyleth, I cast it on-- Seven. Yeah. I'm going to hold my action and I'm going to backpack onto Grog. On his next attack on somebody. Yes. Yes. You know, you don't need to. They're gone, gone? (slap) Since he made an attack, can I? I would like to Command him to be visible. Reveal himself. Reveal! Appear! Fuck you! Do I still get a bonus action? (snarls frustratedly) Isn't it at a disadvantage since he's in smoke? What are we rolling for? 21. All right. (sing-song) I'm going to Guiding Bolt him right up the butt! (laughter) Yep! Third. Natural 20. And double it? I've never done that before! Oh my god, 24! One more! So, 50 points. Still alive! Okay. I think I'm going to stay, and then bonus action, I'm going to throw up a Spiritual Weapon. Yeah. A really large meathook. Right at his back. 27. Ten. I'm going to stay with my Grog. You know what, I'm sorry, I'm going to get off his back. Yeah. Oh, oh! That would be a natural 20! He's a monstah! TRAVIS, MARISHA and Can I use War God's Blessing again? Yeah! Rage fingering? And the Spiritual Weapon, right? And the Spiritual Weapon? Okay. I didn't realize I was up so quickly. All right. I'm going to cast Prayer of Healing over to everybody over there. So, Keyleth, Percy, Scanlan, Shale. Yeah, she's gone. Who's that down there? That's you, Percy, right? I'm going to do it at fifth level. It's a second level, but I'm going to do it at fifth level. Okay. Yeah, I'll run closer. And I'll run around, not into the pool of acid death. Percy needs it? Fuck. Can I go the other way around? I don't have a lot left. All right, then. Okay. Fuck. Can I stay where I was at, then? Okay. Sorry, I'm going to not do that. I'm going to Guiding Bolt then. Can I peek out? Can I move out? What's that? Basic level Guiding Bolt. Nope. Doesn't hit. All right. Can I tuck back in? And I'm going to move the Spiritual Weapon with my bonus attack, or can I not do that? Okay. That's it. That's what I can do. No, 60 feet! Oh. Kill him! Tear his head off! You'll be okay. I've got you. I run over to Percy. I touch Percy and I cast Heal on him. Oh, Shale. 70 hit points. I saved it just in case. LAURA and Grog! I run over to Grog and I jump up on his leg, I'm going to sit on his foot. Yeah, monstah! You what? And that magic trap, we didn't set it off.
