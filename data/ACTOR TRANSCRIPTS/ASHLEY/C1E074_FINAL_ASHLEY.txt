Okay? I am! Yes, and? Loot! Toot! Hooters! Cooter! Oh, sorry. It made all the sense. You know, there is only one place to put loot. Keep it in your crate. Very spur of the moment. That's it. (laughter) We need to fight. We are having a real battle. Can we do one with just animals, sometime? Like during the Westminster Dog Show? I have an idea! (laughter) Hey! Oh man! Wait, so he said we were going to Fort Daxio? Okay! That sounds-- I think it is a great idea. On our walk, we talked about it, and I think that it is a really good idea. I look over her shoulder and read her notes. I think we're okay. It's just right. Come on Grog. Oh lookit. It's a little-- It's so cute. It's a little thorbilly. (laughter) Can I? This is so dumb. Yeah, I'm going to try. SAM and Well, all right! It 's a four. Okay, nine. It was a baby thorbilly. They're a little more shy. This is already going well. I can whip my hair. (air horn) (pathetic horn noise) Maybe if we could make a composting system for them. Poop. Do you have horses? Lots of horses? I don't have it prepared. I don't have it prepared. Love. What is it? What?! That might be a long-- I don't know. Allura was saying we don't have time-- That makes me a little nervous. But you want a chunk of her? Or like, a little piece of her? I don't know. Get skinny, get skinny! Is there anything else we need to know, to be safe, to look out for while we're there? I chose the most lovely and wonderful @KinnVelier. Her picture of Pike had the perfect pose, the most wonderful costume, everything was there. Winner, winner, chicken dinner. Yeah. What?! That one took my breath away a little bit. Rad. 21! They're very smart. You did really well. Seven? "Okay, I farted. It was me." What! Always. Yeah. I'm going to hang back until they come up. I have a question for one of you fine gentlemen. Do you guys--? Oh, I'm so sorry. Anyway. Do either of you happen to know where the temple of Pelor is? You do! You can just show us where it is. I think there's going to be a couple more spots we're going to stop. Well, I got this guy. I don't like to be carried. I don't like to be made to feel smaller than I am, thank you. I'm so sorry, what did you say? Left at where? We're supposed to meet out master at the temple of Pelor, so-- I'm going to cast a Zone of Truth and ask him some questions. Is that a bad idea? Okay, okay, okay. Seven. Okay. Can I cast Hold Person on that one? I think I can do it on a humanoid. LIAM, LAURA, and He's not humanoid, never mind! That's what you literally were just talking about. A bad bitch. They're used to this, this is everyday life. I climb and sit on top of Grog. That's not true. Do you know where those thugs were trying to take us? Or have an idea? (fart sound) Oh, you love it. That was me. Are they wrist or-- Can I put on, if I put on my Glove of Storing, does that mean I have to take off one of the gauntlets? Can I wear one? I hope not. That's the first day of that next episode, so I don't have the schedule yet. I will. I'll have to Skype, but-- Oh, well, okay! I felt like, maybe to everybody watching, but I didn't feel like we were playing that long. So you ended the game and I was like, "No! What? We just-- oh." I love this character so much.
