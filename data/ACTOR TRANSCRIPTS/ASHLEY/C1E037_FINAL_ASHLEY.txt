Hello! I like you! Oh man, you know, I just flew in. Oh no, we're running out of space. Grog! Hi, guys. Wow, this looks amazing! Ooh, burn. Squirrel! I know. It's so magical. Maybe it worked! (laughter) Hi! No, I do! I couldn't sleep! Yes! I didn't think to say anything. I know, but work needed to be done. So you guys made it out. I don't know what that is, but it sounds pretty fascinating. Oh yes, how could I forget! Fully aware of the bag of dicks. I totally spaced. Oh wow. Hi. Bag of Richards? There's a prisoner here? No, I haven't. I've been cleaning. I've had such a need to clean. Is it my armor just falling over? (laughter) Are you sure? Okay. I go in. Hi Tibs! Yes, yes, yes. Hi! There's more of us now! You call him Kibble? I didn't, I just didn't need to go down there. How's his hand? How's your hand, Desmond? Is his hand gone? Can I try doing a little healing? Might as well. Get the dice rolling. What happened? Can I try Lesser Restoration? I want to try healing him a little bit. Let's do two. Wow, that was so inspiring. 15. Three hands! Four. It's okay. Like a claw, like a crab. Hang loose, buddy! What does that mean? Oh! Natural 20! Grog! I take the insults, and I continue. I thought something was wrong. Did you see the stuff coming off the-- Well, that makes me stressed. I'll talk to him, and see maybe if... I don't know, I'm gonna check out the sword and see if maybe-- Okay. Thanks for letting me know. Fist bump. Am I invisible? Hey! Nobody can see me! (clanking noises) This is amazing. How about you ask to jump in for a tune? For inspiration. Good job, Scanlan! Can I give him inspiration? Somehow? I don't know. Yeah. I will-- the man, the myth, and the legend, is true. So, in case you wanted to find out-- (laughter) I got it, I got it, I got it! (laughter) You're welcome, but how come you never told us about Dr. Dranzel? Did you forget about him? Did you forget about Dr. Dranzel? Can I call you Dr. Dra? All right. Sorry. Team Downstairs. I follow them! No, just kidding. Nine. Come on! What else is it gonna be with a disadvantage? Maybe he could stay out there. Come on. Fuck. Ugh. Same rolls. Exact same rolls. Nine. I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up! I've had so much to drink! I need a pan, or something! I have the consumption. Perception or persuasion? Deception? Fuck, come on. 12. 14. I just start running. I just start running. (moans) Oh, don't get it in my head! It would! Come on. We don't have an extra roll? It is what it is. I have a six. Maybe he'll think it's cymbals or something. Should somebody pickpocket her? Oh, do we roll? Is one of them in Underdark? Dwarvish? I do. Is there any way to try to figure out what it says? Unlock the ones that are not trapped. No! High five. Just maybe-- just like a touch then. Okay. (laughter) But there were a lot of hallways No gold. No money. Yep, we were held in these cells. How do we know that's the one that he's in? Okay. Can I intimidate him to give me his weapon? He can't move? Can I go up and try to take his weapon? Please give me your weapon. (laughter) Fuck. Well, it's probably not going to work with a four. Can I just take it from him? 18. 18? You have him held? Hog-tie him. Oh, jeez. I don't know what to do. So intimidating is not working? Can't we just take him out of there now that he's all tied up? Okay. Can I make, with my Spiritual Weapon, a sort of-- holding like a-- I want to make a lasso again. A lariat. Maybe with a little stinger on the end. Just to listen. So his arms-- If it works. That would be a natural 20. (cheering) He's also now grappled. Okay. Can the stinger go right here to his neck? Yeah, we got to take him out, yeah. Yeah. But I can still-- has he dropped his weapon? No? Can I try to intimidate him with my extra bonus attack and tell him to drop his weapon? Okay. So concentrated. And I can help. Loot tying? I mean, rage tying. Oh no. I got you girl. She's out? And I'm gonna heal Keyleth. Wait, what was I at? 30. Can I wedge the door open or something? We're leaving, we're leaving! Can I do a religion check on it? 15. Oh, we didn't get to talk about your sword! I might be able to. No no no, no. We just didn't get a chance to talk to him about his sword.
