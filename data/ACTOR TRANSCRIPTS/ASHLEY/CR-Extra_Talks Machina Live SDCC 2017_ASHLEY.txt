(British accent) On behalf? Wait, bring them back! Hey, man, come on! Did you go? I really liked the Briarwood arc. I really did. I feel like Pike would probably come back as an otter, or something and be like, oh no. That wasn't the plan. I was thinking like a regular-sized whatever. I think I could be a little bit taller, sometimes. Oh no! I'm even shorter now! Pixies! Walk everywhere. Walk as much as you can. Obviously go to Central Park. Wait, when are you going? ELEVATOR Okay, so if you go into Central Park almost when it's dark, which I know sounds a little sketchy, there are so many fireflies, so that would be really cool. Yeah, it might be around that time? Yeah. It's at Coney Island. Yeah. And go to Di Fara Pizza in Brooklyn for a Grandma Slice. I feel like I'd have to go with my tried-and-true. My bestie, Grog. I do actually feel like we would be a really good combo, though. Because you're the brains and I'm the brawn. (laughter) Victor. Yeah, Victor. Yeah, family. The friendship that we all... have. (laughter) I know! That's why I appreciate the friends that you've made into your family, because the Trickfoots, as we know, are so terrible. And also, I think being able to see Sarenrae, the Everlight, in person, I think that's opened up something else in Pike, and what else? Via Skype, but still. (unenthused) I mean, Pike would probably be the god of love and kindness and feelings. (laughter) Duke it out, right now. (grunts) (laughter) I think most recently, I'm surprised I didn't realise Pike would ever be able to have wings. That's pretty good. What?!
