Jeez Louise, Matt. Also, fun fact about Ian Phillips I grew up with him. He was one of my brother's best friends when we first moved out here to LA, and so when that name was floating around, I was like, wait a minute. And then we reconnected back on Instagram. It's such a crazy story. You know, Critical Role brings it all back around. (laughter) Go check them out on Instagram! I didn't either. Wait, did you say your name? Okay. So there is a woman behind him. Taller than your average... lass. (laughter) (deadpan) Yes could I have a drink, please. Just some ale. Just a big. Hello. (deadpan) He's really quite good, you all should line up and get your fortunes told. (laughter) (deadpan) Ohh. Thank you, my lady. That's very kind of you. No. I do not. I just-- I put it up. I put up the stage, I move things around. I'm very strong. But I don't do anything in the show. We've had people die watching it. Yeah. It's just that exciting. Just from excitement. Yeah, just like heart attack. Just from getting so excited, I guess. Yep, nice to meet you all. You're so, uh, wonderful. Beedle-deedle. (laughter) That's the sound for all instruments, right? (deadpan) It's going to blow you away. (laughter) You're going to love it. It's going to be great, but before you go in, I do have to give you guys a pat-down, 'cause you can't go in with any weapons. I'd like to see you try. (yelling) Well, you can't see the show if you have a weapon on you. Well, see, funny thing about that, though, is that's my job. So. No. Well, I am. I hold them. And if you want, I can stand right next to you guys. You can keep your eye on me the whole time. I promise you I will give it back. I promise you I will give you all of your weapons back. Ugh. I don't like-- How about this? I'll take it, and I can just carry you to your seat. Because I'm really fucking strong. (laughter) I don't think I find anything. 12. I just thought your chest looked rather square, so I wanted to see what was happening. No, no, no. Little girl. Give me your other weapon. I'm very good. Wait, I didn't get your weapon. Do you want to stare at me all day, or do you want to give me the weapon so you can go watch the show? It's not really a choice. I twist it around a little. Play with it. This is nice. I like it. I'll hang out beside you so you can watch. All right, well. If you want to follow me, I'll take you to your seats and I'll stand beside you the whole time. Beau. Little one. I just go over and I fireman-style over my shoulder. Since you can't walk. Mollymauk. That Jester's adorable. I like her. Did you guys want to sit in the front row? We want to sit in the front row. Front and center? Or do you want to be on the sides? I take them to the front and center. Ah, shit. I didn't mean anything by it. I just-- Oh, I'm not looking for anything, I just-- That's an extra charge. We do do that, though. Well, it's an extra five gold pieces. These arms are worth a lot. It's the best way to see the show, if that's how you want it. I don't take off my shrug. How about you just keep your money and I'll put you in a chair and I'll just watch over your weapons. On the ground, I mean, because there's no chairs. That's a good point. 13. Okay. How close am I to them-- I want to give them their weapons. Okay. I'll pass my weapons out this turn. Can I get to the big beast? Beast number one? Okay, so this is the first time I've done this, so hopefully I won't do this wrong. I would like to rage. (cheering) Is that something you do later? Okay. I didn't get a practice shot at this. Okay. So I just roll. I don't know how to play D&D anymore! I just forgot how to do it. Oh, reckless. Okay. 17? I take out my beautiful greatsword. It is the first time it's seen battle. 13. Yeah. The first guy. Get the fuck out of my tent! (laughter) Okay, okay, okay. Ooh, that feels fun. Okay, so I'm going to go a little bit closer to-- wait, how many more are left? Just the other one? Yeah, so I'll get ready for the other one. So a little bit closer to it. No. Never. Is Gustav still in here? It was when Toya started singing. Oh wait, look at him! She's fine. Just calm down. I take out my greatsword. Stop, stop. Here's the thing. Oh, it's Mary by the way, but I think I know who might know what has happened here. I'll have to go get her. She is the singer that made this all happen. She's in the back in the tents. Follow me. Go get her. She won't talk to me. She's too scared of me. I close the tent and I take off. We did it, we did it. Yeah, me too.
