I need them! That sounds like something Gilmore would sell. Yes! Gimme! True, true, true. (laughter) Hey, Grog! Oh, I missed you guys. Hey guys! Oh, who are these two? Oh, yes. Mr. Vina. Drez Vina. Hi! Well, it's okay. I think I got to the point where I couldn't build anymore, heal any more people. I needed a little adventure. But everything is as you would think it would be. None at the moment. We've been trying to hold down the place as much as we can, and getting there seems to be okay. Yeah? Yeah, they've been all right, I mean, it's okay, I've been missing you guys, though. Of course. Oh no. Have you heard anything else? Do you think they are okay? Okay. Well, I wonder if we should go look for him That's a lot of them. I think we should wait until we're fully prepared. I think so. I don't think it's safe any other way. Oh Grog, I missed you too! It's okay, Grog! I give him a hug, and I take my blue scarf and I pat his eyes. Okay. Yeah? What! Do you think they'll fit? I would love to wear those. I let out a little battle cry. (battle cry) I fist bump him! 13. All right, because right now my attack bonus is plus seven, so I add three to that. I can't find a pencil! That's okay, I'll make a note. I can do it later. I am unprepared. Yes, I am unprepared for all this strength! No, I can't do anything like that. I feel like I haven't spent any time with Vax. Can I insight-check Vax? Natural 20. I'll post it. Where do you have a mansion? Oh, great! Is there a lock on that, maybe? (laughter) Okay. Oh, this is beautiful, Scanlan! Okay. When they had that fight with Percy, up in the house, I felt like there was something weird with that sword. I'll check it out. Yeah, that's a good plan. Okay, I will. Thanks, Scanlan. I'll help, I'll help. That broom is amazing! Yes! And there are too many chickens in here, anyway. Healing Scanlan. Yes, I'll cast Cure Wounds. What did you say, Matt? Nine. You're welcome. Can I try punching one in the air with my new gauntlets? This is so dumb, why am I doing this? What am I doing? Okay, it's not that high. 11. 25. Thanks, Grog! 14. 15. Wait, how do you spell it? Son of a bitch. Well, Percy, what do you think they are? Yikes. I know, I know, my initiative is always shit. Yeah, yeah, you know, I do the clean-up. I'm eight. Dagger-dagger-dagger! Okay. Since I can't see it, is there any way that I can Guiding Bolt one of the basilisks without hurting anybody? All right, let's do it! Which one would I not hurt anybody? Okay. Yeah, we'll do the one by Grog. Oh, natural 20! 13. Yeah, I'll add inspiration! Okay, okay, okay. All right, seven. So 20. Okay... 17! I'll stay, yeah, I'll stay. Fireball the other holes? Can I go collect some of the (stuttering) basilisk-- I can't say that. Can I get some of the blood and collect it? Can I stab the carcass then in another area and get some fresh in the body? Vex! 16! But, but! Yeah? Hi, Vax! I don't think I was with you. I can try. Remember one time we fixed Vex, when she was turned to stone, the last time we fought the basilisks. We covered her in basilisk blood. Sure. Which stone is he? One and a half. All right, can I head over there? Okay. Can I try covering him in some of the basilisk's blood? It's been too long. Probably Greater Restoration. I do. I grab his arm and Cure Wounds! I don't know if that's a really good move. Can I try to reattach his arm? 5d8 plus five? Oh, God, okay. I feel like I'm using all this, but I don't know. Okay, so let's do level five. 29. Stop moving! What were you doing over here? Oh, buddy. Creepy as fuck! I'm a tank. It feels so good to be back. Yes, very soon! A few more weeks, a few more weeks.
