(singing) They got magic and flair, they got falchions and cunning. They don't see over there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice! (chanting) Role! Critical! Role! ASHLEY and You guys just didn't wake me up for breakfast? Well, yeah, I guess, I did tell you I'm angry when I sleep. I don't like being woken up, I forgot, but it would've been nice to be woken up. (gobbling) Who's traveling under the mountains? Huh. Oh. Yeah, okay. No. No, I just-- You guys were gone for a really long time. You were gone for six days. I looked for you guys everywhere in that room. I was just worried, is all. I don't need anything from here. I have everything that I need, so if we need to go, we can go. Well, I just turned around, and then you all were gone. Yeah. I did say some things that I probably should not share with you, Nott. Something like that. I didn't have a funeral for you. I didn't know if you were actually gone! No! None of you did. Because I didn't know if you were alive or not! I was still holding onto maybe that you were and you just disappeared and you just didn't want to stay with me anymore! You didn't want me part of the group! No, I don't mean it like that. I'm not saying, you know, "Woe, poor me," or something, but-- What else have you found in there? Is there anything else? Did you already look at everything? I never would have known. You fought something? Eh. Well, I can, but I ran out of notches on my belt. (cheering) Well, I'm glad you guys are safe, for whatever the fuck it's worth. You can talk to them? I've never seen bees before. We don't have flowers. I didn't know any different. In the moorlands, there's some. It's a marshland, so there's occasionally-- Yeah. Was ist das? Okay, cool. I guess I'm always looking for a sign, now. Yeah? How did you know it was going to rain? I mean, other than the obvious, gray skies. It just hurts when it gets cold type of a thing? That's a pretty great indication. I'm going to stay up, of course. Just watch. Anywhere I can be helping Fjord. If they need help with the lines-- Okay. I want to stay anywhere on the boat where the storm is most visible, so I guess-- That's where I'll be. Are you him? Okay, okay, okay, let's go. 14. I get advantage now. Oh, fuck. Ten. My low fucking initiative! 14 armor class. That hits. Which brings me to seven total? Okay. Okay. Now that I know this is not who I thought it was, I am going to rage. I would like to rage, and in that rage, I'm going to unfurl my wings. Charisma saving throw. Sorry, this is-- one minute. Hold on. (mumbling) "Be frightened of me until the end of the next turn." Okay. Only within ten feet. Okay, that one hits. Okay. Oh god, I've lost count. 71 minus seven... Can I try and grab it? I'll grapple as a reaction. Oh, fuck. Okay. 22. All right, I'm going to take out my sword and I'm going to attack it. Okay that's-- okay. Oh wow, okay. Oh, shit! Sorry. No, I'll take the first roll. Sorry. I'm forgetting everything. No, I'm not doing reckless. It was 21. Yeah, okay, so I'll take out my sword and I'll attack. I say You're not going anywhere. I'll attack. Okay, that's fine. 23. Plus the seven? No. 30. Jeez Louise. Yeah, I'm sorry! 2d6 on the second one, okay. Yes, I'm sorry. Okay, 12. Oh, no, I'm sorry, oh my god. I have to roll again. I'm sorry. I'm so nervous! I'm sorry. That does not hit. It was a two plus-- No! But if you want to-- Yes, I have advantage on, okay. That's 15. Oh no! Oh god, that's a lot. Maybe? A little lower than I thought I would be. Can I try to grapple again and try to get my sword back? Okay, I'd like to try and disarm. 21. I was like, "How?!" Yes. Okay. Oh no. (sighs) Forgot to reckless. Can you call out reckless? I'm forgetting everything! You have to call it out beforehand, sorry. 11. Yeah. Yeah, ten. Oh shit, okay. I'll take it. Okay. Yeah, both hit. Thanks. No, I would have been under. Okay, my turn. Fuck. Shit! Okay. I'm going to attack again. Reckless. I'm going to try to see if there's a vital that I can get to anywhere. How much bigger than me is he? Okay, I'm going to try to go for the big artery in the-- Okay. I did reckless, yeah. 18. Three? Oh, not as good. (counting) Plus seven, still? Or that was a one-time? Okay. I'm sorry this is taking so long. 19. (groans) Okay. Yeah. Since I have reckless, I can still continue to do it? I'm sorry, guys. Okay, 19. Fuck. Ten. Fuck. I only get it once, I don't get the necrotic damage also on the second. Both strikes? Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do! I feel like I have to fight this thing on my own. What? Yeah, that's my turn. 13. Okay. 20 total. Fuck. I call out to the Stormlord. What do you want me to do?! Yes. Okay. I move closer to it. Is it directly above me? (sighs) This is so stressful when it's about you! No. I wish. Yeah, I'm going to try to climb up. Okay. So I'll just keep my sword at the ready. I don't know. Just stay safe. That hits. Okay. Wait, still? Just one? Well, the first one was good. 21 again. Ten. Okay. I'm going to try to take my blade and put it through its torso. Oh yeah, reckless. Okay, okay, okay. That's...18. (counting) 19-- oh, I'm sorry. 25. Oh, that's right. Okay. Still reckless. Oh, shit, okay. That doesn't hit. A three plus-- nine. (whispering) Fuck. 11. (dice rolling) (singing) I'm still standing. Okay. Oh my god! Okay, okay, okay. Yeah. How far-- yeah. Is there anything in the torso? Okay. I want to try to grab it again. Grab it from the inside and try to pull it off of the mast. I have advantage? Okay, that's right. Both the same. 12. I'm going to try to do another grapple. 22. Can I pull it off of the mast? Okay, my turn? I want to keep holding, and I want to squeeze even harder whatever it is that I'm holding onto, and try to yank down and take us off the-- The mast. Do I roll again? Fuck, I'm sorry! 16. Okay, I'm going to keep trying to pull whatever that is. 17. I am at one hit point. Yes fucking way. I'm just laying there, and I'm holding-- I don't know. I don't know. Am I still holding it? Did you see that thing? You didn't see any creature or anything? I was fighting something. It was a creature. It was winged, and it had red eyes. It looked like it was a ball of lightning. I don't know. I was standing in front of the ship, and I had a vision of home. Then I woke up, and then the lightning struck. When it came down, it was the creature. I guess, if you didn't even see it. I grabbed something out of it. I guess it was its heart. Now it's gone. Okay. Well, maybe I need to think on this a little bit more. Yeah? I'm okay! I'm going to go talk to Caduceus. Hey, Caduceus. Hey. Yes. Sorry. Burning hair is not a good smell. Well, I was-- oh, that would've been nice. Okay. I was at the bow of the boat, and I was trying to connect with the Stormlord. I don't know. I ended up getting a vision. I think I did. I'm pretty fried. I fought something, though. It was lightning that came down and then turned into a creature. Yes. It's here. I think I need to keep trying to find him. I guess he's found me. That's what I was going to ask you. I'm going to go back upstairs. I go back upstairs. I go back upstairs. Mm-hmm. I just want to sit outside still. I guess so. I'm just trying to make sense of all this still. I feel like-- I had some visions of home that made me very happy and sad at the same time, but it must all mean something. Um. Yeah, I had to leave. I did something that... I did something that wasn't the right thing to do, according to my tribe. In my tribe, we have a matriarch of the tribe, the Champion, and her name is the Skyspear. And when you become a part of the tribe, you take a blood oath and you get a name, and I was given the name Orphan Maker. When you become a part of the tribe, as time goes on, you are given a mate. But I fell in love with someone else that was not chosen for me, and we got married privately. I did. But they found out and the punishment for that is death, and they killed her and I ran away, so I... I am a coward, I guess. Thank you, Jester. In our tribe, when you get married, it's for life. Even if she's gone, she'll always be mine. Her name was Zuala. Yeah. I left and I'm sure they were coming after me and I got into the wastes of Xhorhas, and something happened. There's time that I cannot account for. I was out there for months by myself, and it seems like I woke up months later and I looked different and I felt different. I woke up at an altar of the Stormlord, and he saved me. For what, yet, I don't know, but hopefully I can be a better champion for him and fulfill whatever purpose he has for me. I don't know if my heart could ever be healed, but I'm okay with that. I feel like if it were put back together then that means Zuala would be gone. I know one day I want to go back there. I don't know where she was buried, but I have so many flowers to bring to her. I don't know what all this means, but I sometimes... I don't know. I don't know. (background music) I feel like sometimes I get nervous to get close to people because I feel like I lose them. And then Molly. I feel like I'm either very unlucky or cursed, and I don't believe in luck. That's true. Yeah, I think so. I think so. This is very good tea. What's in here? Like it's people? I'm fine with it. Well, maybe this is best kept to us. I mean, I'm fine with saying it, but it's a long story, and... Of course. I think so. I feel like I'm trying to learn that from you, Jester. Yeah, you say what's on your mind-- It's good. I'm going to try to start doing that. To surviving. To minty families. Balleater? The boat is called the Balleater? SAM and The Balleater. I've eaten some balls? Oh, that's true, that's true. Right in the middle of these three islands? Cool. A furry octopus. Come on, Frumpkin. Wait, they're already dead? They're animated dead. I love swimming. I like scrapping. So this is a combo of the two of them, you know? I'm in. 14. That's a good idea. Yeah. That first one was good. 17. Who is this? I have to be close. Say again? I am going to move as much as I can, getting closer to them. Yeah. I'm going to hold my action until one of them either-- yeah, they get close to me. Wait, they were 80 feet away? Oh, from where I had gotten to with the 20 feet. Got it. I'm going to move my 20 feet and get into range. I'll get to it on the other side. I'll get to whichever's closest. They're on the other side, right, of the group? Yeah. I'll get one, whoever's closest to me. Unless I reckless. Let's do that. I'm reckless. Yeah, that'll hit. 23. I'm raging. Sorry. All right. 20. Okay. Second attack, I'll hit it again. Ugh. Reckless. Got it. That was a natural one. Okay, okay, okay. (laughter) Hits. Doesn't hit. So one hits. I'm fine. Oh, why--? How many feet down did you say from the top? Can I try and giving a look-see too because I have darkvision? Oh, you already have it? What would the roll be? Is it perception? 16. They do know we're here. Yeah. This is so fun. Oh gosh. Hey, what a great 2018! It was the best.
