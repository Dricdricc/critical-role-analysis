Pike grew up in the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name of Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream-- a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae, and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome, and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed, and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger, so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea, training with the men and women aboard a ship called The Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready. Whoops. (gasps) Vex, what are you doing? What is this coming out of your mouth? Is it through the lake? Yeah, me too. (singsong) Well, maybe we should go. Take off your clothes! We should throw something. He ate his brain? Clarota, I am a fan. Hey. Clarota, so when you eat their brains, do you also get their thoughts, maybe? Or it's just-- it's gone after that. Okay, I'm gonna jump on Grog's back. And hold onto some straps. He's safe over there? Oh Trinket! Oh, 20! 20. LAURA and Maybe you should scream, like, no, they went the other way! What are you at? 15? Wait, we healed the other game. Even with that? No, it was like 24. 24 points. That was 24. And he still has more hitpoints than we do. Wait, what are you again? Can I-- Wait, can I-- No, I was on her. Wait, can I-- Wait, wait, wait, wait, can I cast War God's Blessing to give him a plus ten? Fuck. How far are we falling? No! No, no, no, I have so much armor. Can I assist? 13. I take-- Everybody in this club getting hit points. Where's Scanlan? How close-- Percy's out, let's go-- Scanlan's out, too? Fuck. A Mass Healing Word. But I'm doing-- Hold on, I'm gonna do a Mass Cure Wounds. (whispers) 24. 24 mass cure. (sighs) Okay. Including myself? LIAM and Can I grab him, hang on to him? Awesome. So, Clarota's with us? Can I go over to Clarota and try to heal him? Should we give him a potion? I think he's gonna give him a potion. What'd she say? Try to break off the part-- My medicine's a four. What's your medicine? Okay. I'll try. A four. What does everybody have? Roll this guy? Okay. Nine? Sorry! I'm sorry. Time to go! He did say go left. Good call. Hodor! Hodor. If I-- I can stay, I can stay awake too, I'm okay. So maybe everybody sleep-- Do we need a fire? Yeah, but can you-- From above? Like where you have the-- That he shielded off? I'm still awake. Wait, are you guys asleep? Wait, I was awake too. Yes. Because I was, I was still at full-- Oh, but my spells? Actually-- -- I fell asleep! I totally forgot. I am sound asleep. I was dreaming-- I was dreaming, it was real-- -- I was so confused, by my dream. My perception was off. I was totally sleeping. And I spaced. I was asleep. Or that was good? I have dark vision, gosh dang it! I'm fucking sleeping. Bad choices, all around! What a good sleep I've had! I have all my spells back! Yeah. Can I just give it a try, just to see? Try make a dent. Strength is? Ten. Oh. (all laugh) Yeah I did! Best pals! Down. Dooagar. Hey! Don't be rude to him! Lack of oxygen. I did, I did. So, when I stayed away, I went to a shrine of Sarenrae, just to sorta see, 'cause I had a feeling that I'd been here, or something like that. So in this vision, I basically saw what we've been going through already. And what the soldier was talking about. So I saw something that was-- there was a single twisted horn of blackened soul matter. It was a point of concentrated evil. Yes. And it was so strong that I couldn't stay in the vision, because I could feel that it was taking over, so I pulled me out of the dream, among various things. But I saw-- The horn of Sauron, is what it said. I didn't see whales. Yes. I some visions of where sort of-- 'Cause I kind of went in past and then got to this thing. So I guess depending on where we are-- Yes, if I see things that are familiar. Such as-- (all laugh) Yes. Past a field of broken glass and bone. Yeah. And the prettiest was into a cavern of blue crystal, where a fungal fortress-- -- sort of entwined an ancient city of marble and jade-- Oh my god. I think-- Yeah. Can I perception check? (all laugh) I feel like that's the way we need to go. I think basically we need to go down, 'cause if we go up that means we're going out. You just love it. Wow. Holy cow. Cast what? 11. Greg. Oh, what? So go jump in it, is what you're saying. This music is so stressful! The ol' reach-around. Too soon? Woo! Nice! Okay. So, question. I want to use something I think that I can use called-- this may be stupid, so I have another option if this is dumb. Yes. Something called 'Insect Plague'. Which you can use as a ranged attack in a 20-foot-radius sphere? Okay, and then it's a 1d10-- creature takes 4d10 piercing damage-- oh, on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. So, I think-- Okay, you know, let's give it a try! Okay, so, where am I? I'm sorry, I can't see. So, where do I need to be to do it-- like over here? Okay. So can I still get it there? Are these all five? Okay, so can I-- Okay, so I'll try to get them both. So then ten. Okay, so how-- Wait, how many do I roll, again? At fifth level? Well, maybe I shouldn't-- Okay, I'll do it. But do I save a healing? Okay, so-- Cool, one. Ten, 11. 19. So how many do I roll? That was three-- So I roll another one then-- I roll, I roll four. Hold on. 19. 25. Eight plus-- Or-- No, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. 16. Okay. 25. Let's see here. Concentration. Up to ten minutes. I'll just keep it. Awesome, let's just keep it. I'm just really concentrating. Don't let it touch you. Acid. Grog is gonna start tripping. Nothing, nothing. He still has more than me. What? How many have you got? Wait, and I can't-- Grog! Falling from the ceiling. I'm okay. I have a lot of armor. Whoa. Okay. How about for healing? Does it help with healing? Can I add it to anything? Okay. You're at 24? Fuck. 26 points of damage? Get it! Okay, can I sprinter's boot over to Grog? Sorry, no glasses, guys. So I don't see where I am. Okay, so I'm going to Cure Wounds. 'Cause that's what I do. So let's see, 1d8 plus spell damage. Wait, so I'm gonna do it at fourth level, so that means I can roll how many times? Okay, so-- Five, eight, 16. 24. So you heal 24. And then-- Well, he adds it to his 14 that he already has. And then, can I do anything else while I'm there? Okay. Okay. I'm gonna-- I'll stay, I'll stay. Double? Fuck! Wait! What? Guys, guys, guys. Oh, hello! You're gonna kill this thing! What did you guys vote on? Probably. Yes, that hits. (all laugh) Okay, so an additional 28 on top of that. I understand. Bye, bitch. So there is only one left? Let's go, Scanlan. Go Scanlan. Wait, do we still have Scanlan's inspiration song? I have the die. Is what I'm talking about, sorry. Grog's unconscious? What? Oh, okay. Nice. I'm going to go over to Grog and Cure Wounds at fourth level. Don't. Nice job, guys. 25 points of heal! You're welcome! Wait-- -- so can I also do a Mass Cure Wounds? Since I just did a-- Okay. So I'll also do a Mass Cure Wounds. Yeah, you're pretty bad. 22 points of healing-- Something additional. Oh, you're welcome, Grog! My best pal. (growling noises) Yeah, man, it's like our own thing. (all laugh) What if we melt it and then make it a big one? I don't know, would that work? Wouldn't that be-- that's mormons! Wait, but then what are-- Oh, thanks. (gasps) Guys, this is really familiar to me. (all laugh) I want to keep going. Thanks, Amy.
