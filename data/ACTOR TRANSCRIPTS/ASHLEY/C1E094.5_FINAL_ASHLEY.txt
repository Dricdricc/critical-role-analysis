That'd be pretty tight. LAURA and Liam O'Brien! He has so many silk robes, so it's fine. I forgot about those! I'm great, how are you? You know, just, second week in a row, just here. Yeah. Yeah. (cheering) Yeah. What's going on? How do you know my name? Who is us? Butters Scotch. (laughter) I was on a plane! I fell asleep and now I'm here! I was watching-- what was I watching? Moana. (laughter) And now we're here. Oh, man, this is weird. Why is my voice higher than it usually is? How old am I? So it's punk Ashley. Okay! What have you guys seen so far? Can we tell if boy or girl? What is it? Anything in the pocket? Can I get a strong vine? Do I add anything? 19. Do I look scary? Oh no! Hey, don't cry! Don't cry, it's okay. Ten, Ashley. I want to know what's inside! Okay. I'm going to take the vine, and I'm going to (lasso sounds). Oh, so I'm close enough to run up to it? Okay. So I'm just going to-- Do I add anything? I do. It's not. 17. Can I do anything else? No, I don't want to leave her! Get it! Good job! No, I didn't do it, it slipped right out. Another one? I'm going to grab that one by its tail and tie it to my belt. Oh my god! This is the best. Why didn't we know each other as kids? 11. Because I've always been a little tough as fuck. Hey, Matt! Matt. You look fucking rad. (laughing) It's on my belt. You know what's really cool about this, though? Okay, I'm going to try to explain this, what's happening in my brain, but right now -- Okay. That's true. We all have friends right now. Because in real life, when I was this age, I didn't have friends. And now, look, we all have friends! Does anybody remember anything? Did we actually get together for dinner? And then we just took drugs for some reason? The rock seemed to do well. Six! Yeah! Yes! Okay! I'm going to take the dead skinned cat from my belt and hold it by the tail, and say, (shouting) All right, you motherfuckers! You better turn around and leave or I'm going to kill every last motherfucking one of you! I'm going to intimidate them. (shouting) I don't care if they're just cats! With a disadvantage? Why? I'm fucking-- 22. Okay, I'll walk up alongside the four of them, just swinging the corpse. It's your call! You want to run, or you want to keep fighting? Four of you down! Five, actually! Math wasn't my strong suit! Can anybody track? What? There's no walls in the thing. When you climbed up to the top, you didn't see any structures? Shit! Wet Bulging Sausages. Warner Bros Studios. There's a lot that's going on right now. That's true. Can I, as we walk, with my handy-dandy tools that are here that I see that you've added. Can I start trying to fashion a slingshot? Yeah! Out of a nice little twig. Travis can attest I'm pretty good with slingshots. Okay. That's a seven, right? 11. Yeah, I'm running. Straight-on. We're just kids! Are there any footprints on the beach leading from the water? What? Seven. Oh shit. What? Can anybody make a boat? The demogorgon? Okay, I'm going to go up on the beach, and I'm going to join them in their persuasion, and I'm going to use the dead cat again. And I'm just going to take a bite of it. (laughter) Does that count? 19. Chew deep? Okay, I'm going to continue with what I'm doing. I'm going to walk to Marisha's smear. Schmear? That's fine. Don't know what I'm doing, I was weird as a 15-year-old, so I'm going to walk over to her body, what's left, and get my hands in it. And I'm going to stare him in the eye, and I'm going to smear it. Is her ribcage free and loose? I'm going to put it over my head. That's fine. I don't know what to do. Sorry! Okay. I rolled a nine. Okay. (laughter) We already know what's going to happen here. We know we're going to die. But, guess what? After this, we go to another world, so you know what? I don't like leading, and I don't like following, you motherfucker! Is my slingshot ready? I'm going to take out a rock out of my pocket, and I'm going to throw it at him. Okay. What am I doing? I don't add anything, do I? (laughs) A six. I don't care. I did it. I didn't mean for it to actually hurt you. Yes! That's a terrible one. This is my nightmare! Yes. Yes, please. Yeah. I'm feeling... confused. A little... I think I just need... How are you feeling about it? Like, what are you feeling-- what is missing? What's going on? Okay. Is that line something I would say? Is there-- maybe if it just sounded weird-- maybe there's another way to say it? If you had to just spitball, what would be another way that I could say it? Doubt. Do you have the sides on you, actually? Do you have the script on you? Can I-- Neil. Can I have that prop knife? I just wanna see if it'll make the scene any different. (laughter) Can I-- hey, Liam? Can you come here for just like two seconds? I just wanted to talk to Liam for just like two seconds. (laughs) I just-- I forgot what I was gonna ask. It's fine. I just wanted to-- I was gonna ask you something, but I forgot. It's good to see you. Good to see you. Go back to bed. Wait. If you had to guess how old I was, what would you guess? Don't let it be dangerous. I can take it. Oh, yeah. Straight-up, how old do you think I look? There's no right answer. Bingo. Guys. We're... Let's just jump right in. I'm sure we're gonna have notes again. "You knew this was gonna happen. The entire time, you were biding your time, and now "you're driving this fleet into the ground!" "God damn it!" Yeah, we can do it for real. I think-- Anything else you want us to do? You do him so good. (laughter) Okay. "You knew this was gonna happen. The entire time, you were biding your time, and now you're "driving this fleet to the ground!" Are fighting Colla? 20. (laughs) Where am I? Okay. And Colla's on the ground? He's dead. Sorry, Colla. And what's the other-- is that just another camera? Behind? Yeah, that. So the thing that we're trying to kill is that one? Or are all the cameras bad? We don't know. Okay. Liam! Are you okay? I'll take that as a yes, 'cause that means you're alive. Ah, man. How close can I get to one of the cameras? The ones behind? Oh, shit. I don't have anything to do to it. Oh, shoot, I don't know what to do! Okay. I'm gonna try-- I don't know what-- that doesn't mean-- are there any wires that're exposed on the biggie? Okay. I'm gonna try to go to the big camera. And start yanking some wires, maybe where I think it can't see me. Okay. And then what do I add to it? A nine. And I do add the strength? Okay. Yeah, so, 11. Shit. Knew I shouldn't have rolled that one. I knew it was a bad die. I'm sure you beat it by that 'oh'. 12. Okay. I can't take it out 'cause I'll bleed out. Is there any way to break off the arm? All right. I'm gonna use my mocap knife. Those are actually pretty strong. Do I get advantage because it's mine? So I would add both of those? LIAM and 12. I mean, I'm just gonna ask-- yeah, 'cause I can't attack again, obviously. I'm gonna ask the big thing, talk to me, what do you want? 'FORGIVE M--' or 'FORGIVENESS'? Hey! Yay! Thanks, Matt. So clutch. Isn't it my turn? Okay. I'm going to-- The 'HUSBAND' threw me off. I am going to move further that way to get away from these two that are there. Well, maybe just like out of range of them, touching range. So maybe just like-- Yeah. Towards the lounge. 12. Even with the helmet on? Yeah. I wanna go further in, towards the lounge. But I wanna get in eyeshot of the big computer dude. Actually, I'm so sorry. I want to go further in towards the bigger guy. But kinda walk around so I don't get attacked by the other one. I'll dash. Yeah. Okay. Can I just put down my mocap knife on the ground? And say, I think you've created or done something that's gotten out of hand, and I forgive you. C'mon, Neil! 'Cause she's a good friend. Travis! I can't believe you. Okay. Talk to the big guy again and say, where do we find you? No. (laughter) I just-- depending on what he says determines what I'm going to do. Can I do that? Okay. I'm going to-- (sighs) Shit. I'm gonna start running towards the fucking green Crafty. 'Cause I don't think he's in that thing. I want to go around that thing. No, the other side. The other side of the chasm. Are they connected to the computers that are already in the muck? All of the ones that are in the pod area? I don't want to abandon this. Can I get to Taliesin in this turn, or no? Okay, but I can get back to the big guy. Okay. I'm going to go back to the big guy. I'm going to kick that SD card, the glowing thing at the bottom, again. Okay. I do? 11? Where do we find you? Answer me! Yeah! Okay. I'm going to pick up the little SD card thingy that flew away. What if Liam's in there? I'm going to start running toward Taliesin and start making my way out, but also a little more toward-- (sings) Walking fast, 30 feet to Taliesin. Let's go. I might do a speed walk. Your special purpose? I peek in. Sequins. I kind of want to see what's on the other side of it. I mean, yeah, break it. Okay. Onward ho? You got it! We're almost there. On your six. I'm on your six. Is it connected to anything? Any computers, anything else in the room? I look at his body in the cylinder and I say, how did this happen, Liam? What if we take you out of there? What happens? Are there any other options? No, he won't. Yes? Does it stop at 9,000? That's what I was trying to get at. That's what I was trying to get at. So you're still in there? Were you following us at one point, as an old man? Why won't Matt's way work? If we go back to before any of this happened. Yeah. We will indulge you for just another thousand years. I'm going to go to the back of the cylinder and just see what's back there. But it's connected to something? Do the wires just go back into-- (sighs) We can't kill him. You know what? We're dying on a Thursday doing what we love. I'm okay with that. Slow fucking clap. I love you, Liam O'Brien. I haven't heard you laugh that loud in a long time. You were not able to hold it together. That was beautiful.
