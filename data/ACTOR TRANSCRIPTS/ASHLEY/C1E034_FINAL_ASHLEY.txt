Yeah! I haven't gotten to see mine in person yet, and I'm excited. Yeah! I know! I didn't even mean-- I just pulled them out of my suitcase today. And then some people were tweeting back and I was like, "Oh, shit. It looks like I'm at home." I was like, "Ah, well." Really? (laughs) Wait for it. "Oh hi, Grog!" Wait, high five! I am so nervous. Oh, hello Laura! You look so pretty! Are you all still there? Grog, but you don't look like Grog. Is everybody Percy and Cassandra? I give Percy-Trink some ear scratches. I'm here to stay for as long as I can. It's very hard to stay in this form, especially when this place is very dark, and sometimes I just get pulled away, so I'm going to stay as long as I can. I'm so happy to be here. How are you, how are you guys, are you okay, where are you at in terms of health? Okay. (laughs) Oh, Grog. I go over and put my hand out and hold her hand and say, it's so very nice to finally meet you. This astral projection is very hard to hold. (laughter) The connection is just not very strong. Yeah. Yeah. I got one. What was that? Yes, I am. But are there any on the ceiling? I'm halfway here. This stupid astral projection is driving me nuts! All right, let's go. Yes, let's go! Scanlan, not now! I take my hand and I Guiding Bolt the top of the gem. One more time? Sorry, I can't hear you very well. Okay. 16. 16. Okay. Total of 20. Okay. Okay. Sorry, guys! I don't know what's going on. I know, it's the evil! It's so strong! I rolled a 19. Good news, guys! We're not going to drown. What? 16. 14. I can do a healing spell, you know. Where's everybody at? Are you guys all pretty low? Well, let's hope so. (laughter) Now that I'm thinking about it, I think they are pretty good friends. Can I go up to Vax and-- Shit. Okay, sorry. That must have been when I got disconnected. I know what's going on now. Am I close to Percy at all? Or did we already separate? Dang it. 13. Okay, I'm going to use Healing Word for Percy. Even with a 60-foot range? Am I close? I'll use my Sprinter's Boots. Oh, because I can't see the board. Oh, am I close to Vax? Can I get right behind him and cast Greater Restoration on him? Can I try that? I'll move back behind the pillar. No. I'm going to wait. Yes! What are you at, Percy? Okay, I'm going to Sprinter's Boot over to him. Say again? I can use it twice. I haven't used it yet. Okay. Is that within range? All right, so I'll Healing Word. Okay. So I can't Cure Wounds because I'm not close to him, right? Okay. So let's do that. Oh my word, I'm shaking so bad. Okay, here we go. Just rolling. 26. Five. Sorry, I did five. Shoot. Okay, I'm not close to him. Can I take my Mace of Disruption and slam it on the ground? Oh god. Wait, how close am I to Sylas? Okay. You know what? Let's just do a Sacred Flame. Sorry, guys. This totally sucks. Okay. And then can I use Scanlan's extra? LAURA and Eight! My turn? Okay, so I would like to Channel Divinity and Destroy Undead? Okay. Let's give it a try! How close am I to him? You know what, I feel like I want to hit him with my Mace of Disruption. Come on. Okay, 16. But I'm going to use War God's Blessing and add ten. Okay. Got it. Okay. How many times do I roll? Okay, got it. Sorry guys, sorry. I'm back. Thanks! Okay, 21! Yeah. I would love to go up to Vax, but I don't think I can, right? Okay. Then I'll stay, I'll stay. Can I go over to Vax? I'm going to Remove Curse on him. Yeah, can I Greater Restoration on her? No. Keyleth? Do you have Greater Restoration? I'll go. Can I get to her? Can I get to her? Say again? Okay. I'll do a Healing Word. Okay. We've got to get her out of here, or nothing's going to work, right? Okay, let me try to pull her out the door. Okay, I'm going to try it up on the roof. Healing Word again. Wait, I'm touching her? Cure Wounds! Can I try Divine Intervention right now? Yeah. 12. 11. Can I try to Cure Wounds again, on Vex? No.
