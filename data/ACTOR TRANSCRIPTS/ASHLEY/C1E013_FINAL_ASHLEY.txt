Happy birthday! Yes, that's awesome! It's an awesome name. I'm scared! I really am. That's me! What do you need? Yes, I do. To carry her? I don't know if I-- How about-- well, hold on. I can un-stone her. That's my last 5th-level spell, so we might need to rest. Wait, but I cast-- nope, never mind! Keep going! (whispers) Can you instill an inspiration? I rolled a six. Six total. (laughs) 16. 39?! Yes! Yes! Ugh, okay. I just rolled a one. What do you need? I wish we had inspiration. So he rolled a 20. That's it, that's all she wrote. He rolled a 20, so that's gotta mean something. (frustrated noise) Maybe the guy that has him, his tentacles or whatever? Well. That's far. Why the gnomes? Why the gnome hate? Tasty gnome. Get it. That was amazing. Plus! Plus War God's Blessing? But can't I just do it just because? 14 total? Every week. We can make her not stone, except we didn't get a chance to. Get it! And then we'll stomp on him and make brain juice. Big damage! Put it on, Percy! Perce! "I abandoned my troop!" Did anything happen to the guy that had me-- He just took damage, he's still (slurps). It's my turn. Come on. Fuck. It's seven. You saved my life. Because Tiberius can get some of us out, right? We can't get you out of here if you don't come-- Wait! Can I do a Mass Cure Wounds before we leave? (laughter) We've got to go somewhere else. Can he grab her and climb? You got it, Trink. 19. (gasps) Scanlan, are you hurt? I'm great. Well, not really, but I'm just going to pretend I'm happy so that everybody can be okay. (laughter) Well, can I do a spell? Okay, Mass Cure Wounds. For the, well, hold on a minute. How low is everybody? Not really that low? He's pretty low. No, can I just do-- I can? But he needs it, too. Shit. All right, I need it? Oh no. All right, 17. Now I'm at 23. Wait, so bonus action? He can "bear-ly" hold one. (groans and laughter) I can't do that, right? I can't get on Trinket? So as a bonus action, I'll give Scanlan a kiss on his cheek. Oh no, we got to get it together. How do we get out of here? All right. Can you sing? 14. Okay. Maybe we'll be okay? Could somebody also use Telekinesis to pull it to fall the other way? There you go, boss! What? Awesome. Make some brain jerky. Awesome. Little brains. Yeah! 16? Yeah! Man. Thanks, Keyleth. Much better now. Can I do anything, or that's my turn? Wait, where do we go? Nobody's taking us? Oh, okay, got it. Yes! I'll go over and cast Greater Restoration on Kima. If your crushing couldn't kill it, the thousand pounds? Hello. I just want to get in my bed so bad. I'm so happy. No, because I want to be able to have an extra 5th-level spell. Yeah, let's go to the Keep. Yeah. I know, should we go to a tavern and get some ale? Well what do you mean, do I mean it? It's all empty? How far is the Keep from here? But should I go just in a bush just behind and-- No, and cast Greater Restoration on Kima? Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready. We forgot our key! Feels like three months. Hey! (laughter) Bad News. He's a little rat and he still went in his big bed. Don't the dwarves already know that they were there, and they were already prepping for battle? Wake up from bed! Wait, so why are you guys so against giving the Horn to Kima? Does she want to destroy it? So why don't we destroy it? Ex-squeeze me? I don't think that's true. I did kill a dragon. Huzzah. I don't think I can destroy it. You could hang out in the temple downstairs. I'm starfished on my bed. Where's the Bag of Holding? Can you check in your bag to see if the Horn is still there? Can you tell if it's in there? Okay, yeah, go down to the temple. Okay, so, I'm going to stand behind Kima and-- Face her towards the wall. Or towards something happy. Yeah, okay. So. So I cast Greater Restoration on Kima. Could I do it? Are you doing a religion check, Percy? I'll do a religion check. So fucking close. Can I go downstairs and go get Grog? Me? Okay. I'm still going to go get Grog, but I'll pass the scroll around. Hey Grog, come upstairs. Just don't say anything yet, but just come upstairs. She did, yeah. And also, he actually pulled you out of the cavern with one arm while you were stone. Out of the whole place. That was rough. I was just rolling bad. Thank you, Becca. Percy power! Wait, 1350 z by 1350 x? Thanks so much! No Mercy Percy! What? I got a Celtic knot! Nice, what the heck! Oh, well, let's just-- Thank you, thank you. Guys, thanks so much. Thank you guys so, so much.
