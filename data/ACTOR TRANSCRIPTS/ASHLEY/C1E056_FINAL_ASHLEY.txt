Whoa! That's a rad shirt! Don't give me a squeeze, it makes me uncomfortable. I don't like being touched. Oh no. I just fart every time. Is it, though? If we separated it? We can let the people decide? Is it a terrible idea to let the people decide? 'Cause maybe they would give us more? (sighs) I don't know, because maybe some of it may not all be theirs. I'm not going to pray over this money! I'll help, I'll help you look! I just rolled a one. (laughter) Can I try reading the runes? Just, arcana check? 16? Can I try taking a sip? Just seeing if I can just drink anything in there. Aww. I thought something cool was going to happen. What if it's just like a Jug of Holding? Like you could just keep putting stuff in it? Intelligence-- Wait, what's the book? The book is Leadership and what? I can carry some. I'm strong. Hey! (laughter) I'm strong! Where are you? I'm going to cannonball in too. Should we have a cannonball contest? You got in? No, he went into the corner? A cannonball contest? Let's do a cannonball contest. How much money should we put on it? Grog can officiate. Be fair. But vote for me. Keyleth! That was good, that was good, that was good! Hey, it's my turn! Do a little stretching. Yeah. Naked with gauntlets. Nope! 23? Whoa, that was a big one! (laughter) Oh, wait, you should have gone before me. I'm sorry. Sorry I jumped you, Percy-- He was gone, that's why. Good job, good job. Total Party Kill cannonball! Hang on. He still has to go. He's not in the room. Oh man! Oh, it just gives you, you have all the charisma? Oh my God. I can't stop laughing. Please somebody draw him just sad in his room eating mayonnaise-- Oh, my tears. That salt and pepper hair? That's true. That's true. Well, if he's so charming, I just wouldn't be able to help it. Oops. (laughter) All right, all right, all right. I've seen you before. Do you know Wilhand? My great-great-grandfather? Great-great. Yeah. Two greats, not just one. Yes. You probably have had some drinks with him before. He was, and is, but we're just never home. I feel like it's a good idea. We could just leave it with Wilhand. And then we could tell Quall-- We wanted to leave it in one place, just in case we see you again. Kerr, do you know how to make armor be quiet? (laughter) I love talking shop. Let's do it. Tell her? Yeah. I look around for Wilhand. We see her? All right. We'll walk over to her. I sit down next to her, too. (whispers) Should we just wait till the morning? I don't know if you're a woman of faith, but-- I follow Sarenrae. To Reggie. Is it morning? You left it in the kitchen? Me?! (sighs) Well, I'm not very charismatic. Do you want to help me? So we're telling them-- asking them if they want to stay. And if they do stay, that we could built them shelter. So are you thinking they won't want to stay, then? How do you know? That would be bad. Okay. I'll go, I'll go. (airhorn noises) (stuttering) Hello, everybody from the town. I know I'm not one usually to speak up, but because I know so many of you and some of you are family-- (blows kiss) Um, we-- I'm sure you guys have heard because of the party and festivities from last night, the dragon has been killed. And we know that some of you have stayed because if anything else, this is your home. And some of your family has left for Kymal? Kymal. But we wanted to give you all an option. And for those of you that do want to stay, we would like to provide you with an underground protection of sorts. To help rebuild? No. Yes! What do you want to rebuild? I mean, underground-- I can try Divine Intervention again so-- No, just the bunker, right? Not the city. Keyleth can make the bunker. We're going to build a vault? (kid voice) This a bear! Didn't you volunteer me to help? I'll go with you to Kymal. Let's bamf in. Can you fly? I do think it's great! There's so much that I wanted to talk to you about, Kerr! I'm so glad that you came along! There is very important work to be done, and I feel like we all need to focus on that, and get down to the nitty-gritty of it, you know? Let's go, let's walk! I'll go with him. May I? I can. Okay! I don't think I can. But you guys are headed to-- Where are you headed to? Where are you going to go? Before they go, I just reach out my hand and introduce myself to Kaylie. I've heard many lovely things about you. I'll make sure that he keeps it. Vasselheim? I think I know why he needs to go back to Vasselheim. It's not my place to say. I take him and I pull him aside. I know that you've been avoiding me. And I just have to say, I don't know who this-- I don't know who or what this Raven Queen is, and I think that's what scares me the most. But I know if you're choosing a life of faith or whatever you want this to be, I'm happy for you. I'm getting bits and pieces. Vax. Don't be sorry. I understand now. And I don't think that you're lost in any way. I think if you felt in some way that this is who you've needed to follow, then follow her. I don't think that's true. You can be, and you are of use. I'm not the type of person who would ever say that you have to choose and follow who I follow, but I will tell you now that if the Raven Queen fucks with you, or hurts you, or doesn't change you for the better, then she's going to have to deal with me, and we're going to have a problem. But as of right now, I love you, Vax. It is going to be fine, and I am here for you, no matter what, and you can talk to me any time. Don't be ashamed or embarrassed. Okay. Don't be ashamed. And turn that frown upside down. I will do my best. Sometimes people call, and sometimes I just have to go to do work. (laughter) But I adore you. Okay? Well, you are all kinds of fucked up all the time, and that's why we love you. We're all all kinds of fucked up, and that's why we all are together. See? And I give him a slap on his bare ass as he walks by. You okay? You will be. Ish. That's all we can be, is ish. Okay? Okay.
