Lord of the Wings, I would go there. Just as a side note. Morden-cayenne wings! Let's do it. I love it! Huh? Oh, what? What? This is the way I'm shaped, what's wrong? This is my shape. This is my body, leave me alone. May I try it? Does it only fill up with one kind of alcohol? The kind that doesn't get you drunk is not very good. I do, too. I feel like when I see someone else throw up I feel almost like I do (retching). No? No, I mean, I don't know if that will help. I think it was just gross to see (retching). Uh-oh. It's still happening. Yeah, I think it's the sound, too. Especially if we're staying on the main path, you know, we'll see anything that pops up. I'll take the back. Caleb, can I hold Frumpkin again? I like him. I'll take a watch. I'm going to hop off the horse and go look. I have rope. I have lots of rope. How heavy is it? Can I try to punch it into place? One of us could be a wheel? I could try. We could also kill those people and take their horses. We could say we were helping out-- what was her name? Hail. Very cool. I'll take next watch, too. I'll take last. Okay, okay, okay. Holy moly. Near it. I'm here! Okay, eight? Sure, if you want to get under my hood here? Well, it doesn't come out all the time. It's just if I get really mad. Are you dry? I feel like I don't know if I want to keep doing this. Okay. Could you give me a moment? I'm going to go to the tree over there. Yes. Okay. I go where near the tree was struck close to us. I heard you, and I wanted to thank you for saving me, and I promise you I will be the best servant you ever had. Thank you. I'm going to take a piece of the bark and I'd like to carve the symbol into the tree, the Stormlord symbol. Not very good, but just to have it there. Sorry, I take a piece of the bark to have and I use my sword. I got a piece of this bark from that powerful lightning that struck it. Yeah, I wanted to put it in my things. I like to have things from nature. Yeah, I do! I pull out my book. I mostly put flowers and things in here because I'm collecting them for someone and I want to keep them all in here from my travels. Yes. Yeah. But what are the things you collect? Oh, just the bottom bits. What do you use them for? And should you need to resole your shoes-- Have you ever put them one on top of the other and make a platform shoe? Cool! Well. Very much so. Do you want to get back under here? It tipped it right over. That sounds like that wouldn't be something that's real. Me neither. But I see from her, you know? She fixed a wheel. Naturally, she could make a house next. I'm on a horse. I don't think I heard anything. Uh-oh, it's happening again. Is this terrain similar at all to Xhorhas? Okay. Same. Wait, using what? Oh, yeah. 13. Oo-wee! Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun! 40 feet. I can't walk in, right? Yeah, you get more out of it. That's still something. Oh no. Don't die. Okay. How close can I get to the-- Oh shit. Okay. Well, I would like to rage. Get that fired up. I mean, I can't move anymore, so-- Oh, yeah. Yes. All right. That's my turn. Just hits. Okay, so I'm in the jaws. Okay. I will try to attack. Divine fury, and if I do reckless, does that mean-- Okay. I'll do that. That's a natural one. Okay. Sorry, hold on. Oh wait, no, I'm doing this one. 17. It's the first strike, okay. Okay, so eight-- 18. Am I actually able to-- If I have my hand on his jaws, just pull them apart. Open the jaw, just stand. Okay. Oh, finishing blow. Okay. I'll try to chop off the head as much as I can. Yeah, can I move towards the back of the other one? In front of Jester; in between the croc and Jester. Perfect. Yeah, perfect. It's like a mockingjay. I love him! You could get a rest. Where's your-- Same. We both roll, but--? 16. I've never seen them before? LIAM and Maybe we can keep her in the cart or something? Do you have any more pocket bacon? Are you hungry? Probably the rest of the family, too. Might be the only one, she-- Insight check. She killed them all. Her parents just left her, you know? What's her size? Just going to kick her up out of the bog. Can I insight check her? My insight is so bad. 12. I don't trust her. It's weird. With Frumpkin-- She's going to try it sooner or later, you know. Because if she has it, she won't-- Do they have portholes to the water? Okay. You just said "coin," right? Which make--? Wait, but I didn't put any. I'll put in ten, and you put in-- Both of them. Stairway to Heaven! "But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea!" (laughter and applause) Wait a minute. Did you already give him the gold? Hang on. Excuse me, how do we know you're going to show up tomorrow? And not just run away with the gold? Ah, that's right. You're staying with us. Yeah. Take your pick. Choose wisely. Good choice. Awesome. I start pushing the bed up against the door. Now, you can sleep with your clothes on. I throw him a pillow. I'm sleeping in the bed. No, you didn't pay for this room. (gum popping) No. You won't fit in the bed with me. I am very big. Let's not. I'm going to leave it on. I sit up against the bed. We'll see what happens! You never know! He could get lucky!
