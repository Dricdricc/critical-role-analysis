There's so much X-Files stuff in here. This is awesome. My favorite part of Wyrmwood Gaming is the magnets. Magnets, bitch! (laughter) Kiss it! Kiss it! Wait, how far down does it go? Why's he laughing? 12. Oh, you know. Moving on up. Get him, baby. Make it attuned to you! No! Ow ow ow ow. Since I can't reach Kevdak, I'm going to send over a Spiritual Weapon. Range is 60 feet. I'm going to do it at a higher level, I'm going to do it at a level five. It's a big one. (laughter) Right above him. It's, I don't even know, a big-- I just want it to be a big sword. This is a bonus action, yeah. Yeah! That would be a natural 20. All right, okay. Okay, I'm going to use Divine Strike to make it 5d8. What did you say? 22. Is 30. Aw. Yeah, I should probably, I should probably-- Awesome. Okay, so I'm going to, would it be possible to get down on that bottom roof and hide? Yeah. Five. It's okay, I can run out of there with my Sprinter's Boots. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, we're going to be fine, we're going to be fine. Yeah. Okay okay okay okay. That's not halved? No, it's only halved because he's-- I'm a barbarian, too! (laughter) Maybe he only has like ten hit points. It's also probably very hard for him to shoot through the people that are attacking me. Okay. Yeah. Go Scanlan! Oh, I'll take it. All right. I'm going to put on my Sprinter's Boots. What's that? Yeah. Okay. And I'm going to run around towards the back of the house. Okay, so I'm going to go around to the side. Yeah, as far as it'll-- Fuck. Yeah. All right, I'm going to heal myself. A little, doing a little rough here. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself. At third level. What's that? Oh, I cast Cure Wounds on myself. I can't do any, don't I have a bonus action? Okay, I'm going to use my spiritual weapon on him again, on Kevdak. Okay, and I'm going to use Guided Strike? It's still under it. Oh, yeah, well then I'm great. Fuck, I'm forgetting everything, I'm so nervous! Okay. Yeah, we're good to go. 22. No. I hate this bitch! Should we just take a break or something? Because I fucking fell off the fucking roof. We should've killed the guys first. Okay guys, we can do this, we can do this. Misses. Misses. This is so fucking stressful! I thought it was the armor class goes up one. I'm at 20. I'm pretty rough. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I have an idea to try and get out of it if I need to. I mean, who the fuck knows if that's going to fucking work? Okay. I'll take it, I'll take it. (singing) I'll take my d10, use it later. Fuck that guy. What is it, what is it, what is it? Kill him! Kill him, Keyleth. But now he has 70 extra hit points. (singing) Mini-box. Kill 'em, baby, kill 'em. C'mon, Kiki! Falls a little deeper in what? Oh. Aww! All right, so I'm going to look at the three around me, one of them fell off the roof, so there's only three there, right? Well, one of them fell the roof. There's how many there? I'm going to tell them. I'm a barbarian. I'm going to look at them and I am going to Command all four of them to attack each other. At fourth level. 16. Well, hopefully, hopefully. No. I'm going to use my Spiritual Weapon. Say again? I have to move anyway. I'm going to try to-- yeah. I have inspiration? 14? I mean, I'm not going to somersault, I'm going to sneak around. Okay, well that misses. I'm alive, I'm alive. I am at 15. 20. Okay. Plus what? All right, 24. Fuck! I can still move a little bit more, right? Because that was only-- But how many feet did I move, how many feet am I able to move anyway? Okay, I can move 15 more anyway. But wouldn't that be included in the attacks that I just took? If I can move 15 total? Should I stay? I'll just stay. I know, I know, I know. Well, he didn't feel it. Just misses. I'm growling! Arrr! TRAVIS and 15. I can. I'm like-- Focus on the mission at hand. He dies! If we kill everybody, maybe I can raise him. Fuck you! Get 'im, Grog. It's great, it's great, it's great. We witnessed, we witnessed. Hi! Can I use War God's Blessing, or? Inspo, inspo, inspiration from anywhere? Can I heal Grog? I can see him. So I'm going to cast Heal on him. Yeah. Get the fuck out! And I got to go over and heal, yeah. Already healed him. Could I-- I have Raise Dead. Okay. I'll go over to the little boy and see if I can-- 20? 24. Thanks for helping, Percy. Where do you live? I think that was the most stressful game I've ever played. It's the best. I have Loot Crate and it's the best. Big fans, big fans.
