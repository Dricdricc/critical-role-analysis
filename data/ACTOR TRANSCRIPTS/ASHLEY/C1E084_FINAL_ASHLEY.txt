Listen, I know how angry you are-- --but we need you here today. So he can at least have more of a chance to be the father that you've always wanted him to be. You have no idea how much he loves you. That may be true, but not as much as you As long as it takes. Uh, yes Okay. I guess we'll go ahead and get started. (sighs shakily) I have a couple things to say but I know I'm already-- I reach in my pocket and I pull out a little doll, and-- Scanlan, I don't know if you remember this, but you gave this to me, and it's a little doll of you Which is very appropriate. But when I died, this saved my life because you gave it to me, and I didn't know that you had put Healing Words in it. It saved me, and I hope that today I can return the favor. I place that next to him. I prepared a poem. I don't have it memorized, so hold on. Here lies Scanlan the bard, A gnome who sang soft but died hard. To anyone who hears us, both far and wide, Bring us back our dirty friend At least one more time. He may not be tall, or brute, or rough He may be little, but his heart is buff. We are a party, and every party needs a clown, Without our friend to reign us in we'll burn down your whole fucking town. (all laugh) You see, I love this gnome very much. He's small like me, but he's touched. He's raided and slain, He's pooped while he sang, But if he's gone forever I won't be the same Now that he's learned he's a dad, The journey that all of us had Cannot be in vain Will not be in waste. Please, Scanlan, open your eyes and see your daughter's face. Okay. Oh man. Okay, okay. No way. Two! Holy moly. Â That responsibility is so scary. It happens. So, lootcrate. (everyone laughs) It's such a cool thing, what they have this month. You know, if you love power rangers and leegos. I love leegos. Can't do it like Sam. I'll go with Grog and Scanlan. Don't come to my room. We can't-- that's-- the earrings-- I'm going to stay with Scanlan for a bit. Just for the night. Do I hear them at all on the other side of the door? Okay. 19. Okay, I'm gonna peek my head out the door. Hey. What are you drinking? And why didn't you bring some to me? You are--that must be like an intelligence serum. Probably not, Grog, but thank you. Can I insight check him, since I knew, since I could hear what was going on? Okay. 18. One for me. Should we all sit on the bed around Scanlan, like a slumber party? Oh my god. What were you guys talking about out there? If I can be so rude to ask. Great, great. What do you mean? They don't always work. They don't. We've been very fortunate. We've been very fortunate. What, did you-- why do you ask, Kerr? Swamp ass. It's a thing. I remember very well. Do you feel-- I understand. (whispers) Yeah. We could play a prank on him. Did you want to go through his things? Well, I mean-- I actually would agree, 'cause what if there's something, you know, that he needs our help with but feels weird about asking? Of course. Okay, what's your idea? Oh okay. Okay. Can I go grab one of my-- I'm gonna go grab one of my nightgowns. Is my nightgown a little big on him? (all laugh) (singing) More to love. That's right, I got all the games. What are you thinking? Okay. Okay. (gasps) We'll have an art party. All right, so I'll start undressing him. Five years. Good, good good good good. I'm so glad you're back. Sleep is the best medicine! Some people say that. (all laugh) Aaaaay! He was talking about his butt getting sweaty. We all agreed it happens! (make "flashback" sounds) He stayed in the Raven Queen's temple? I know that. I think he did. I-- I don't know, I was up in the room that I-- He stayed there when we left, so he could still be there? I'm not sure. Figured it was appropriate when he woke up, that he would-- Not anything-- No, he just-- we wanted to make sure he stayed-- that he didn't-- --didn't roll off the bed. Keep him there. Yes. Grand, what is it? Grand Poobah..? That is adorable. Awww. No, none taken. Eyyy. Those are mine? I can give her the shoes that I was wearing! What are they? What's she giving me? Oh, shit! Thanks for giving those back. (all laugh) I-- You're great. (all laugh) We'll say the words. That face will be burned into my brain. (all laugh) Okay. Oh, that's right. Rustic? It's a great idea. Yes. Go look at the garden and temple. I like it a little overgrown. I didn't get into it. Wait, he said we can't open the box, right? Or did he say? I know, Okay. No, I just wanna know for sure Maybe it's actually somebody requesting that we do something that is nice then, which I feel like never happens. (all laughs) I don't trust anybody anymore. Zofah. Was the box already checked for traps? Can I check it for traps? Okay. I got an eight. I just don't trust anybody anymore. Okay, I'm not good at-- Okay, let's go. Let's go. I just feel like this is something fishy about it, it just seems too easy, you know? Too simple. All right. I'm sorry! I just-- (sighs) Or I could be killing all of us. What if I just take a peek? Or like open it to a mirror. It might hurt me. Shake it. Listen. Divine Intervention? What if we bury it and it turns into something crazy? I don't know. But that's what a shyster does! You know? They tell you things to make you feel bad! To buy their magazines! (all laugh) Just... everyone! Everyone in Whitestone. You guys haven't been there long enough. Yes. I know. All right, let's go bury the, you know. I'll carry it. (all laugh) Okay. Okay. No, we got her name, right? So we'll make her a little tombstone, we'll do a whole thing, then. We're gonna make it nice. Put Grasping Vines all over it. Let's go. Do people bury their dead here? We both did a history check. 15. Well, there you go. Like a container store. Yeah, Abundant Terrace. We'll decide when we get there. Hello. Do you-- do you guys live here, or are you just passing through, or checking out the town? Beautiful place. Do you-- do you happen to know, or knew of someone named, uh, Zaafin. Do you know where the Birth Heart tree is, actually? How long have you guys lived here? And you've never heard of a Zaafin? Insight check? 24. I get a whisper? Thank you. Thank you very much for stopping and talking with us. They have no idea who she is. They just wanted to be on their way. Is it better to open a box and put the ashes out or is it-- It does? Well, I-- Matt, can I ask you a question? (all laugh) Is it respectful to-- -- when you're at a place of another god's worship to-- I know we did at the resurrection ritual, but to bring another god into it? Oh, fuck it. Do I get advantage? I have no idea. I was just saying 'cause---- was in the Raven Queen, but we were using Sarenrae as well. I feel like Melora and Sarenrae-- Percy? All right, well, are we going to dig a hole or we just-- So, we don't know what we're planting here, so if it's something bad it's not our fault-- (all laugh) I'm talking to Melora through the dirt. Augh. Yes. My precious-- (all laugh) It's so beautiful. Yeah, take your foot off and watch. Maybe, I don't know. I dunno, I just still feel weird about it. What's the Crucible? Yeah-- No weapons? No armor? Nothing? They got gnome fights? That sounds like a blast. Oubliette. (groans) Yeah, I'll go with you. Nothing. (laughs) One punch! Oh, my god. You're gonna have your-- And he's like, "Not good enough." Come back! And Lootcrate!
