What? A mace? Yes! Who provided these? Yes, thank you! No! Get outta here! Love you. Oh, is that a dice holder? All right. He would, he would. Oh, what? That's disgusting! But what if we have him help us fight? Where-- Go for it. Grapple him? Can we go? (sing) Clang, clang, clang! (laughter) Hey, I don't need to be stealthy, now! Oh, natural 20! (cheering) Nighty night! You put him in a coma. He's not just sleeping. No! 20 will do! Hurkee durkee durkee. Oh, come on! Don't kill him, still? How are we going to use him? 18. I don't like going first. I like picking up the pieces. Go first. Look how big he is! He got a little bath. Okay. I'm going to make a Spiritual Weapon. I'm going to make a Spiritual Weapon. I want to make a lasso again, of sorts. But with a grappling hook on the end. So it will spin around him real quick. And keep him in place. Okay. Where am I at? Okay. Yeah, I want to get a little closer. Just hold on a minute, I want to-- Yeah. Do I roll for damage or anything like that? Or, since it's a grappling-- Okay. Inspiration? Anybody can-- Yeah, you want to talk pitiful for stealth? Come on, Bad News. And he's grappled? He's double grappled. Shit, I forgot that he was already grappled. Wait, that's a cliff? 15, or five-zero? She has a Sleep arrow. Wait, so short time means what? I do. You speak Undercommon? Oh, oh, uh. (speaks Undercommon) I'm going to tell him he's handsome. (speaks Undercommon) (laughter) I thought I'd try. Oh, Scanlan, but she has really good aim. Oh, Scanlan! What are you going to name it? I have a question. You said he's a cursed giant? Do we know that it's enclosed? Oh, yum! We still have to go through the fungal forest, right? Man, I wish we had some Cold Stone right now. We'll sleep. Should we nap? How's Vax's foot? We should just go knock on the door. (laughter) I feel like we should save that acid for the beholder. I have some rusty instruments. From the torture room. What's a rusty trombone? (laughter) No, we're just trying to see if, maybe, we could-- Should we do it? Should we nap and then you guys go? Huzzah! That's fair. He's going to drink the whole cask. Grog, we'll give you a whole thing of it! Grog, are you crying? Oh shit. That is a natural 20. Clerics don't lie. And he's dead. Amazing. I go over and pat him on the shoulder. It's okay, Grog! I'll get you ten casks of ale! Once we-- If we live. TRAVIs I have allergies down here. All right! All right! Let's do it! So I have to roll medicine? We're going to rest? Oh, we just rested. Shit. How do we know how much is left on-- We don't? So, 20 for medicine. Yeah. I know. Shit, I don't know what level to do it at. Since we're going to the whole thing. Level one? All right. I'm sorry. Ten. That's awesome. (sings) Goodbye my love! No, no. I-- Well, it's from a movie that I saw. Oh, it's just like flashing pictures that all move together. It flashes. Yeah, sentry bats. Onward, ho? Do you have any ideas, real quick. Or were you hearing anything we were saying? Kima? I just mean there's a lot of ideas thrown out, but do you have any idea, specifically? If I were to use Divination soon, how long does that last? Divine Inspiration, I'm sorry. It happens the moment you use it. Okay. So is that something, just a question, that I would do now or maybe in the battle? Okay. Let's do that. All right. Just was having a moment with god, for a minute, guys. Sorry, I'm back. I feel like we should use some of that, though, for the beholder. Okay. Do we do distraction duty? Maybe people who have really high-- All right. Are we going up? We all have to be in one area. Going up on a Thursday! And Trinket? Dick-finger eyes? What is the plan? This. Is. Vox Machina! I scratch him behind his ears. We have two carpets, now. Matt? (laughter) I tried. We have two carpets. Stealthy should go first, and that's not me. All right, who's on the first carpet? It's a good idea, though. What if one of us ride Trinket? How long does it take to make the trip? They're hanging out with Pike. There's enough room now, for the carpet to go back and take all of us? And we get a plus ten? 39. Plus ten? 16. Nothing to see here. I feel like I'm already just going to start crying. We gotta get the prisoners to try and help us. They're stitch monsters, okay. I don't-- I don't want to. I just don't want to do it, I am so scared. I have already died. I know how it feels. And I won't let you guys die. I am on it, I am on it. Wait, d10 for me? I am gonna cast Death Ward on Grog. I can cast it on more? So how many people can I cast it on if I cast it? I am gonna cast Death Ward on Grog and on Vax. Vax. Do we have anything that is gonna stop us from falling towards our death? 4.2. Seven. (laughs) Seven. That's okay. Why are you "oh man"-ing? Is that a good "oh man" or a bad "oh man"? Can I give a plus ten? War God's Blessing? You were 16? 19. I didn't know that. That's cool. Maybe we can get him out? Me already? I was at seven. You're aiming at-- Sorry, I just got so scared, I heard my name. A strength saving throw. Okay. What would that-- What is that? Oh no, okay, I see. 12? Oh. Okay. You can? Yeah, I'll do it. A d10. That's a ten? Two. That's a 14? Okay. Okay. (nervous laugh) What was it, athletics? A five. Oh, four. (laughs) Okay. Things are going well. Oh, it's me? Okay, I'm going to-- Oh, she's grappling him? Okay, so I'm going to get up, and then, I think, probably, it's time to do-- They don't? Shit. Okay, so if I use the Divine-- Sorry, I just have another question about that, where I have the percentage? Is it only for that turn? Then, and then, Sarenrae just intervenes whenever. It's a little early. All right, so you know what? I'm going to do Flame Strike-- Or, sorry, I'm so shaky. What's that? Sacred Flame, Sacred Flame. I'm so sorry. Sacred Flame? And then I'm going to send it on over to the beholder. Nope, that's not what I was going to do. Fuck, I'm so sorry you guys. Where's my-- I'm sorry, I know I'm the worst. I had something else-- Flame Strike, Flame Strike. That's just-- What I just said. Yes, Flame Strike. Yes. I'm so stressed. Just right by the beholder. Just right, right-- Yeah. Clarota's there. God damn it. Nah, I'm going to-- Can I change it? I'm so sorry. Can I do-- Fuck Clarota? No, we can't! Guiding Bolt. Sorry guys, sorry guys. (sighs) Okay. Okay. So it's a 15. Oh, I roll twice. 15. Oh, it's eight. 16. He hit me again because I took a long time. But my strength is really low. 14. Nine? Okay. All right, all right. Nice, Kima. It's okay, just rage. Just rage, it's fine. Grog smash! Yeah! Yeah. What? Can I heal if I'm still grappled? I'm going try to break the grapple first, 'cause then I can-- Eight. Three points? Okay, so-- Okay, so, I'm going to do a Mass Cure Word-- Healing Word. So where's my-- and I'll do it at-- Cure Wounds, I'm sorry. I am so flummoxed at the moment. So nervous for all things. Okay. I'll do it at-- let's see. 13. 20. 20. Is that also including myself? All right. All right. Hey, you know, it's chipping away. Chipping away. How many of them are there? LIAM AND She's all the way up there. 61 points of damage? Oh no! Come on, buddy. Yes! I'm so stressed out. Okay, I'm going to-- Can I run over to Grog? The grapple was off. I'm going to try this. I'm going to put my hands on him. Try to cast Revivify. But he put it in the Mending Wheel! He put it in the Mending Wheel. It didn't work? Okay, never mind. And I have Gnome Cunning, so I get to-- I get advantage on wisdom checks. Yeah. So what do I add? 16. Okay, so that's not a thing. The first one was 16. He needs-- He's one hit point now, so he needs a potion. Do you have potions? Can I give him a potion? Okay. I'm going to give him a potion. I'm going to-- I have a big one. Yeah, I have a superior. 25. Okay. It's something. Okay. 19. Thank god. Shit. We're going to die. Okay. Ten. I don't add anything. Sweet. All right, all right. How many? How many did you say? MATT, LIAM, AND 45. Okay. Just to be clear. Okay, it's Divine Intervention time. I think it's time. Just, sort of, aid every-- Help us kill this thing. That's my action, okay. So, now all I can do is move? Can I-- Actually, can I Divine Strike, also? I think that's a-- Okay. All right, well, I'll just-- Oh yeah, I'll take a potion. What are you-- Oh, that's great. Nine? Okay, great. Get it. Thank you guys for sticking out. Vex had a lot of hit points, too. You did. Bunch of firsts, guys. So we still have a lot to fight. Oh my gosh. That was amazing. What? Hey, man. Oh, man. We tried, at least.
