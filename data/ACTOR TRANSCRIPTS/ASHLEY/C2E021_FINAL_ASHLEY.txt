Unreal. You're so creepy. I'm going to pull the bed out from the door. Are you ready to get up? Great. (retches) Okay. Open the door, we'll head upstairs. Whoa! Yasha. Yeah, I mean, that's just me. Thanks. So can you shoot out fire out your nose, and all that? Can I see it? You know what? I really like your scales. I would probably fashion a cool cover for my arm. I'm not going to do it, I'm just saying it's really cool. Full transparency. Wait, we haven't eaten-- oh yes, we have. Sorry. Nott-y. (singing) Kiri come back! Yeah, stay close. Stay close to us. Yeah, but we'll be right behind you. I'll take the back. Holding onto your head like a kid. I'm looking on the back. Nott. Oh no. Ooh. Come on Caleb. I will move towards it with you. I'll take out my blade. He's got a beak? Fjord. There's one of him and however the fuck many of us. They eat you if you're little, you know. I like that idea a lot. Yeah, I would agree. I want to be close enough to Jester in case anything happens. Can we put some of the little ones-- Nott. Bren, get in the middle. Kiri. I'm going to get in the back. Oh no, it's happening again. It feels like it's coming up. I go running. Wait, did we already give him the 100 gold? We're going to give him at the end, right? We gave him half? If he dies, we can get the money back. I didn't know he was that big! Nope. Six. Every time! It really is. I have a plus two in this campaign, also. Good grief. Same! Okay. How close can I get? Fuck, that's not going to work. All right, well, I would like to rage. I'm going to scream out, in a super intimidating voice. Oh shit. Oh my god, you're amazing. Okay, fuck. Shit. Okay. Well, I'm not going to take it back. That's as far as I can go. Yeah, I'll do that. Am I within ten feet of it? Okay. Can I use necrotic shroud, then, if I use that as the action to run? Okay. Can I just yell at it? Super intimidating. Oh, but then I've got to fucking attack something. All right, I'm going to be super intimidating and say Drop it! Okay, that's intimidation. Intimidation is minus two. I look so mean because my charisma's so low. 17. Oh I can use my strength! Oh yes, okay! Okay, okay, okay! Okay! 22! Okay. Can I like slap myself? Does that not work? Shit. Wasted a rage. (singing) Bird, bird, bird. Bird is the word. B-b-b-bird, bird, bird. So good! I love it. She has five heads? What do you plan to do with the bowl once you get it? How was the bowl used in the ritual? Yeah, maybe it'll open something. I was behind. What if she dies? She's down here with us, in the corner? She's better not die. You're half-orc, but what's the other half? You assume. Right now's the moment. I rolled a six. It was a four. We're trying to get backstory! 13. Wait, does Kiri get a turn? Big six. We die first. All right! How close can I get to this guy? Shit. I won't have an action. I can do the rage, but then it can go away. Which is possible. Can I hold my action? If he tries to fight or attack Fjord again, I could-- that's not going to work. Oh god. Yeah. Until he gets in range. We don't know that. Okay, I'm going to move to the guy who's been attacking my boy, Fjord. On the side. I would like to rage. Divine Fury, all the bits. Reckless. Okay, that hits. 19. Okay. Ooh. 20. Another-- All right, ten. 2d6 plus five? Wait, six plus what? 11. Can I as a bonus action-- (singing) Lollipop, lollipop. MATT and Flurry of blows. Yeah, it totally sticks to it. I'm still keeping watch. I'm watching the hole. What if we tie a rope to you? Here. Tie it around. I'm not there, but-- Yeah. If you want to destroy it, why don't we just destroy it right here? No, I don't mean me. Wait, is it magical? I'm going to try to take out my Magician's Judge sword. Because I can try to Dispel Magic. I'll try to do it. Might not work. Yeah. What's that? --cast as a 3rd-level and the ability check bonus for the spell is plus three. 13? Sorry. I really didn't either. I just-- Well, hey, (stutters) I just-- I didn't think that was going to happen so fast, to be honest. I keep my arms down, but I give her a pat. You're welcome. I'm glad it was me and not you so you don't get in trouble or you're not marked or anything. I do have a question. The jewels in the bowl are they still there? In the eyeballs. Six. The dragon one. I wouldn't have skinned you, that was just a joke in the beginning. I won't-- (quietly) I would have, but I just-- I can't wait.
