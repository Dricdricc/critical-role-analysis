13. So it's just one up? (laughter) Good plan. Good plan, Clarota. Hey! What happened in there? (Grog voice) I want to rage! Here we go! So that means I roll twice? I take the lower one. He's not dead? Can I-- so he's at a disadvantage, basically? So can I go up to him and slit his throat with my mace of disruption? To make sure he's dead? Yes, I want to. Is that really bad, though? I just wanted to make sure he didn't come after us. Is Sarenrae gonna get really mad at me? They're really bad! If they're really bad guys, they were super bad. The duergar are so bad. She'd probably be happy-- Come on! I'm not moving! I'll go around back behind where Trinket and Vex just went. That would've been really cool. Can I-- Is there a door there? Somewhere, right there? I can't really do anything. Check it out, check it out. All right. (laughter) Maybe I get a sudden urge for some reason to just poo on the bed. (laughter) Yes, I know, I'm just kidding, That's not what, that's not what I want to do. I was just, had this feeling that Scanlan was doing something and I felt that-- Okay, so I'll just-- I guess I can't do anything while I'm in there, so? Can I just-- Yeah, okay, so I'll just hang out there. I'll follow, I'll follow. No! What was that? That's a one. (laughs) I rolled a one! I did bad things, I did bad things. I shouldn't have killed a man while he was down. Wait, so what does that-- That means we just can't do anything, right? No, no, no, no. Oh, so did I. Best friends. Gnomesies. (laughter) Yes, go Kima. No, you won't! Whoa, what happened? Could I do a religion roll from where I am? I can put on my sprinter's boots. Hey guys, I'm here! Did you know I was coming? (laughter) 17. Attack him! Get him! Hit it. (music flares up) Yeah! Can I start moving back? You're too late. So future t-shirts-- Were you guys saying something, like it would be artwork from-- Oh, well, where's everybody at? 'Cause maybe I can just do a-- some healing up. Yeah, what are you at? Ooh, yeah, you-- I need to, I'll get on that. Anybody else? What's everybody at? (sings) For you and for me and the entire adventuring band. I healed you, 18, which was actually low, but I rolled really high for each roll. That's my-- Definitely the stealthy ones with me. (laughter) Which I saw in a vision. I think that's what's controlling them Sorry, read it wrong. Can I cast, 'cause I've been wanting to use Thaumaturgy. Which can make your voice three times as louder. At the moment he'd be speaking, okay, so let's do that. So maybe I'll tuck behind him, on top of you the scorpion, and then when you're getting ready to talk I'll just (whoosh) and then you'll-- your voice will be, you know, you'll have-- What if we did like your Dimension Door? Is it too not very god-like if he's coming up the staircase like, hey? I'm riding on her, so I probably won't be rolling for stealth. Just kidding. I probably won't roll well, just putting it out there. So you guys are stealthing up first? Can I take off my armor right now? Amazing. I'm going to cast the thing on him. 14. I have no idea. I'm going to go back, because if they see me, then they'll know something's fishy. Oh ho ho. What! I'm so stressed. I'm not moving. I'm like this! Five. Not to brag. Where you at? Where are you at? It's okay. I got you. Tight, tight, tight. (laughter) All right, time for some healing. So pull me in there. I'm gonna do a-- I'm gonna do a Mass Cure Wounds. At level five gives, which I thinks gives-- thinks? Which methinks gives me 4d8? Plus my spell ability modifier. Okay, so-- Oh, so, 20. 20 points of healing for whoever would like it. You turned to stone? Can I-- I can't, I have to go-- Close your eyes! We'll get you some of that-- we'll get you some of that blood. Blood! Basilisk blood! What do I get? Hey, thanks, man. You're no longer alive? Oh god, this is bad. I can create it. There's so much to do. I don't know if I should heal you, if I should rub blood on you or if I should go try to remove the curse from Grog. Can Remove Curse remove the thing off of him? That's an arcane effect. Okay, so, Grog might be on his own for a little bit. Okay. So can I heal Scanlan and then also rub some basilisk blood on Tiberius? Oh, 19, 19! Is there anything else we can do? Is there anything else I can do at this moment? I can move? Can I take anyone with me while I move? Can I try to drag Tiberius away from the magma? Athletics? 19. Get outta here. (laughter) It's 20. I just flip him off. (laughter) Can I give him a War God's Blessing and give him a plus ten? All right, plus ten, so fifteen. Good job, Scanlan! We run! Before, before we leave, can I take some of the basilisk's blood and put it in a vial? Dexterity check? 18! Can I make another one? Four! Two. Can I grab him? Can I grab him out? 12! Can I heal him? 24. Can that ever be healed? Sorry it went late.
