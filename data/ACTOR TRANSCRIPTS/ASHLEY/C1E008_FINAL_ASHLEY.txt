Oh, you can do without the pinkie. 12. 20. That's my low roll. No! Scanlan! I'm going to walk over to Tiberius and cast Greater Restoration on him. Tiberius! I didn't know if that was going to work. I have another 5th level now, so I could do it again. No. We already got through. We're on the other side. You don't have to act like a god anymore. Are we going to rest? I can, but then I wouldn't have another 5th level. You're welcome, Tiberius. (all laugh) I am going to walk on over to Kima. Touch her. Cast Greater Restoration again. I touch her arm. I put my shield up! Calm down! It's okay! You were mid-swing, I get it. We are fine it was just a shield. We're fine. Because we need to heal. I am pretty low. You're at two?! What if we took a short rest? What if we just took a seven-hour nap? (all laugh) Okay. That's okay, we all start somewhere. You're welcome. Could we put invisibility on her? I know. You're right. I see what you're saying, but we need to... He's at a two! Could I try healing? A very concentrated energy just on his foot? A healing spell? Let's try it. If we're going to rest, it doesn't hurt to try. You can sleep on it. I'll try Cure Wounds at, I'll try 4th level, since we're going to sleep. So I roll... Wait, plus my spell caster-- Please do. Waiting for you. 27. What do I roll? Do I roll the 20? 21. Hey man, we got a little stub. A little bit. Over time, I just keep doing it? It's gonna take time. That was just a little manicure that we did real quick. No, he will, Scanlan! You just calm down. I reach out really slowly and give her a handkerchief. (all laugh) It's already so hot in here with all the lava and stuff, I would just prefer to sleep alone. I'm sorry. Oh, I forgot you had that ring. We have advantage? I do not. There's no plus anything? Ten still? 21. We've rested. I've been here! I was here in the vision. Yes, it was a field of broken glass and bone, and I feel like this is it. And then after that, I got to a cavern of blue crystal. I think we have to go beyond this. We don't have the magic carpet. So never mind. What if these bones come to life? Should we find traps? Check for traps? I have a question. How many feet across? I want to run across. (all laugh) Wait, are we getting on the rock? I get my Mace of Disruption ready. Into a tiny tiny? Oh no, this is terrible. I'll take my symbol back, put it back on, and say, this is something that I've got to-- this is something I need to deal with. We can't just put it in a Mending Wheel. Yes. I think I know why it happened. I think it was when I slit the guy's throat. She got mad. Just a hunch. Yeah. This is something that I need to fix, but thank you for trying. A little kitty. I go and I snuggle, and I nuzzle him. All right hop on. I hop on. But Scanlan weighs nothing. I jump on Keyleth. Grab some feathers. Four. Team Single Digits! Yeah. Get it, guys. Come on. I'm not happening for a while. It's a her? Disadvantage on his roll! Oh, we know. We know. Do it. Yep. What did she say? But don't I get a plus ten? Eight. Because my armor's so heavy? (laughs) Aw, dang it! I can maybe try to Sprinter's Boots my way up. No worries. Do some damage! Hey, you know what? We're getting close! Yes! 1d8? Okay. Okay. So, from where I'm at-- I'm on top of a wall? I'm going to Guiding Bolt the whatever-it-is. (all laugh) And then-- okay, wait, hold on. Let me cast that at-- So what do I roll for? So I roll the d20 to see if I hit? Okay. 15. Oh, plus-- wait, what am I plussing? I'm so sorry! Okay. 23. Yes! 15? And I'm going to add my inspiration from him. So, 19. Okay. And then there's nothing I can do from there, right? I'll stay! (all laugh) And can I cast War God's Blessing on her and give her a plus ten? For an attack roll? It's not for damage. It's for-- I understand. Okay, great. A little straddle action! He's dead! Okay, so where are we at? I'm so sorry. I can't see. Okay, so I'm going to use my Sprinter's Boots and get over. Everybody's healed; everybody hasn't really taken too many hit points? So I'm going to go around here. Oh, I don't know, can I have-- What, plus eight? 16. Okay. So then, since I'm there, I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt again. And then I'm going to cast it at 4th level again. And then, which is-- 18. Oh, which would be 26. Sorry, guys. And then do I add anything? 26. Hey, thanks! Sorry, Vax! It's still alive?! Oh, wow. Okay. Where's he at? We'll heal him! Kill him! Attack him! Roll for damage. Wait, what? No. I can add a plus ten, right? What's taking this thing so long? How is this thing not dead?! What does Clarota want to do? Wait, so we don't know? Okay, I run up and take the Mace of Disruption, which also has the holy oil on it, which fights against undead! So I take it and I go (ffff) right underneath. It's scared of me. Yeah, that's right! Yeah. Can I keep propellering my Mace of Disruption as I walk? On the ground? Follow me! Follow the track! Can we-- Go ahead. Sorry. Should we take the body? Can I cast Cure Wounds on Trinket? And I cast him to 20. Second level. I rolled. Yeah. 20 total. Can I keep on? (guitar noises) Is it a color? If we take a short rest, do we get any spells back? I'm going to kill that bitch! Chat room! Oh, man. Yay, thank you! I know. Hey! You're not useless! Thanks Curt! CheeseBug! Ponies! You guys made me an emote! Oh! Come on guys! That's awesome! Oh, what the heck!
