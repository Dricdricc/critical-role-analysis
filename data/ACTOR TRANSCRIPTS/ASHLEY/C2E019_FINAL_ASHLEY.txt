What are you doing? Yes, stop it! Human growing in. You guys are fucking each other up. (chanting) Level five! Level five! I am along for the ride. I mean, I'm up for all of it, you know? Whatever you guys decide. May I see the map just to make sure? It's pretty big, but I mean, I'm from the south, anyway. I'll go with you. The Wand of Smiles. Should we just get that started, and we'll go? I don't need to. I'd feel weird. Well yeah, I'll ride a horse. I'll take a horse as well, because you guys are all in the cart, yeah? (sneezes) I give him a pet. But is it real? I don't understand because sometimes it just poofs, you know? I am not trying to make you upset or anything, just sometimes it goes away then it comes back. I'm confused. Can I touch him? He's making a very strange noise right now. (purring) No, I have heard of cats, but Frumpkin is one of the first. That's true, we have lots of rats. We have many creatures. Yeah. We didn't really have any. No. But I like him. I'll take second watch. Plus two. You do it. Sure, but Frumpkin is making me so warm. I have a very warm shawl, too, but do you want my--? This is as far as I've ever been, you know? Here, I've only been to Xhorhas and Zadash. I did grow up in Xhorhas. I did grow up there, but I left there, I think it was about-- I think it was about eight months ago, yeah, from what I can remember. All of this is still very new, you know? I like this stuff, grass and things, you know? I think so, it's a much softer ground to sit on, you know? Instead of a marshy, sandy-- Yeah. I don't know if I had a favorite part. I mean, it's all I know, but it's probably not the best place to grow up, now that I'm seeing everything else, you know? I think, sometimes I wish maybe it was a little different. Yes. I think I will always have that. Well. I don't know if you're going to be that impressed by it, but maybe you'll like it. Yeah. Well, I wonder, I mean, I wonder if anyone else-- I think, is our time up, or--? But yeah, you don't see it and you don't get hungry? Well, that I understand. We'll be right back! Okay. I'm going to get off my horse. (spitting) Stop it. I'm going to knock on the door, yeah? (knocking) Oh, yes, hello. We were just passing through and we saw some smoke, so we just wanted to make sure everything was okay, and come over here and check on you, but you seem to be fine. But did you have-- I don't think you answered the other part of what he was saying. Do you have any wares for-- For sale? Like some meats. Now, I have a minus two, guys. Yeah. 11. Shimmy the shake. What kind of trade? No. I'm just moving him around. I can't! We might have some bacon. How much are you selling the hide armor for? Thank you very much. Apologies for intruding. It looks like there's some hide armor. Yeah, we got some food for the road. Shit. It seemed like it. He is selling stuff if you want to go check. Meat and-- TALIESIN and Yeah, okay. Shall we? He's dead. But that shack is now ours. This is our keep. What do we name it? I'm going to take a little niblet of it. It's very good. From tasting it, do I know what it is? We'll see. Don't fuck me, Gil. Five. It's very good. Yeah, I like it a lot. Yeah, it's a delicacy. I'll take first watch. Yeah, me too, I guess. I just am excited to see more, you know. Yeah, it's nice to be on the road. You haven't? That's true. (laughter) Where's investigation? Oh, eight. I found some of these. I'm going to put them in my book. I've gotten a lot of different ones now. Yeah. I'm going to save them. I'm getting quite the collection. It did! I got panicked. It's really what I do best, guys. It's my most consistent thing that I do is roll shit initiative. In life and in-- Yeah, always. Six! Okay. How many points of damage did you say? I'm sorry? 22. Oh shit, sorry! I was just trying to-- That's how I get rid of the poison. (airy fart) What do you guys call this one? What do you call this con? You're at full? Okay, so I'm going to walk up to this guy. I'll look back at Jester I'll save us, it's okay. No, the other one, up here. Yeah. I'm going to get really mad, and I'm going to use Necrotic Shroud. SAM and Can they see it? Because it's only if you're within ten feet of the person. Okay. Yeah, I think you're right. The effect is only-- Okay, so now I have an attack, because of Extra Attack? Even the extra action? Well, I'd like to rage. Yeah, because I'm not going to move. I rolled a natural one. Wait, did you get the little goblin back there? 14. It's time. Okay. I'm going to attack the giant, big thing. Okay. Do I need to roll for it? Okay. Yeah, I'll do reckless, I'm sorry. I didn't say that before I rolled, so I'm not going to do it. Okay. I roll it again. It was 16. The first one. 13. Divine Fury. 23 for the first hit. Okay, I'd like to take out my blade, and I'm going to put it up to his chest, and I'm going to grab him on the shoulder and I'm going to yank him down the blade. (appreciative groaning) Okay, so I will move. Can I make it to this? Okay, great. Okay, I will attack him now. One less d6 because it's not the first attack, right? So 2d6. Because of the transformation. Okay. Oh, on top of the extra five? It's plus ten? Okay. 21. (growls) Is it gone? I feel fine. Molly has seen this before. If you sometimes startle me out of my sleep, it happens. Sorry. I got startled and I got mad immediately because I saw him. I don't-- Yeah. I guess. It just happens. I don't know. Not that I know of. I was the only one who had this thing. I don't know. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I get really angry, you know? Don't you wake up and get off on the wrong side of the cot, and someone startles you awake? I don't know. I reply back in Celestial. I say Well, of sorts, I guess. I didn't know you spoke this language. I mean, I will tell you, but-- I will tell everyone, it's fine, but should we clean up or, I don't know, something? Yeah, let's do it because I've-- We'll talk about it, I promise, I just, let's just-- we'll talk about it, I promise. Okay? Hello. SAM and It's nice to talk with someone who has, you know, language from-- I don't-- Yeah, it's Xhorhasian, so it's amazing that you know. Did he say excrement? Nott, I'm very sorry we made fun of you eating children. Wait, so you ran away? You can't be the only one. Same. I can take the first watch. I'd like to stay outside for a little bit. Who had-- did you-- were you doing it? I didn't roll yet. 13.
