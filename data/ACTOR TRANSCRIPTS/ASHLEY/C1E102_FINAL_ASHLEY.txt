So, special announcement about my hair. No. There's a time jump in Blindspot, so I'm here. Oh, shit. I love them. So much hair! Just hanging out. (singing) Hello Seattle! It's a song. I think it is. Will it protect all of us? If we stay tight? I can help with that. 22. I move to the side and put my head down. I could go up close with somebody and do a medicine check. Since we're close, can I do a medicine check? Are we close enough to? Oh, shit. Okay. 13? I could turn them. I can make them run away. I want us to be quiet. I don't want to make a big spectacle. Because I can make them go boom boom, but let's just wait. I don't like it, I don't like it. 22. If you don't make eye contact. Jumping through as fast as our little gnome feet can take us. Can I grab her arms? Maybe he can tell the others to leave us alone! How long does Heroes' Feast take? We can't just take an hour? Are there any doors? No windows? Yeah! Put him a little lower, Grog. I rip off the necklace. Oh my god, we're so terrible! Natural 20! We'll give it back! You've got to answer some questions for us. Grog! No! I was going to-- whatever. We'll find another one. It's okay. Brains! I think I got a little in my mouth (gagging). You guys, are we not going to do a Heroes' Feast? How's everybody doing right now? TALIESIN and Let's do a little Mass Cure Wounds situation. Oh, fudge. 13. My timing is bad. (laughter) I forget, and then I remember to do it, and then we're already on the air. Just to make sure I used Gnome Cunning, because I get advantage on wisdom. Okay. So then I'll take my first roll, which was two. And then I will add my wisdom saving throw number, which is ten, so I have 12. On the rest, could I have worked a little bit more on enchanting the silver bullets? I just keep working on it. How many people were still standing? Lots of them died in the blast? It won't just be three. Shit. What's it made of? Obsidian? I'm just nervous. I know we don't have time, but what if this is one of those decisions where later we're like "We should have fucking done a Heroes' Feast"? I don't know, though, I don't know if we have the time. This is hard. I almost feel like it should be the other way around. Let's do it. We thought of that. All right, guys, we're going to do this. We're going to do this. I'll hop up on the carpet. That's awesome. Put it away. We're fully Leeroy Jenkins-ing. 17. Not necessarily! Oh, yeah. Matt, how do you do this?! No! I'm useless! Let's use it! Let's just make it, Matt, you can put that in your new campaign book. Mass Restoration. Okay. Oh, fuck. (brightly) Six! Did you say 17, Matt? Okay. All right, I'm going to touch Grog and cast Lesser Restoration. Paralysis. Okay. So I've just got to run around. How many undead are there? Okay. Yeah. So, as my bonus action, I'm going to cast Shield of Faith on Percy. Which will just add two to your AC. First level. Okay. Sorry. I'm going to hide behind the beholder. Get him! Do we know what would hit? War God's Blessing to add ten? Okay! Yeah. Let's not and say we did. Can we see what's in it? Wait, what? Yeah. I'll make it. Yeah. I can make it to her. Yeah, do your thing. This feels like when we played in Liam's one-shot when we got on the beach. I can't do what I was going to do. Fuck. Okay. Sorry. Hold on. Nope. When are you up? Yeah. Wait, who's up? Okay, so Percy's next, and then it's Scanlan. Okay. Oh my god, I'm shaking so bad. I will start casting Revivify, and I will hold my turn until Scanlan bamfs us. There's no one in between us? What do you get if you're inspired? And don't I get gnome cunning, so I have advantage on it? 18. Hi. No. So bonus action. Can I do a bonus action? Okay. I'm going to cast Healing Word on Vex. Level four. Level two. Ten hit points. Can I move? Oh my god. That wasn't his turn? That was a legendary action? That's right. I don't want any of it! I don't even want to play. He doesn't know who it is. Why did you say okay that way? I make a constitution saving throw? Okay. "You're spired!" Okay. 13. No, just the 13. Plus-- 19? Okay. Okay. He's all by his lonesome! Grog! You're back! Are we trying to get out of here? What are we doing? But then what?! We still have to fight him! Okay, I'll run to-- sorry, I'm stuttering. Keyleth's doing it? When's your turn up? Okay. I'm going to do Mass Cure Wounds at 6th level. Let's see. Fuck, this is a bad roll. 26 points. I rolled so badly. And then... am I able to also, at this point, see if I can channel divinity? It's not like she's going to show up. Okay. Sorry. I'm so hot. Okay. I'm just hanging out. Wait. Can I do a Mass Healing Word as my bonus action? I'll do one person. Who's closest to me? Where are you at? Oh yeah, you're nothing. Let me do the Healing Word. 16. I knew it was too low. How much? 78. Okay. That is okay. I'm unconscious-- 14. You know what? It's fine. I'm alive. Nothing is going well! Bob and weave. I can bob and weave. 23. Eat a bag of dicks! I know. I want Taco Bell so bad. We might have cheats tonight. You just pulled out the wild Uno card. (laughter) Oh my god. Let's do one more hour. No.
