You got it. I didn't know that. I was with Caleb and Nott. Yeah. I'm rowing back. I go right. No, I'm just kidding! I'll go to the left. Well, you could get on my shoulders if you-- Oh, that's terrible! That's $300? Wait, did you roll a one? Oh, okay, sorry. I got excited. This is awesome! I always roll shit initiative. I don't know what-- Yes. Four. I rolled four. What's a two in German? LIAM, TALIESIN, and Wait, I don't think I can-- since I have danger sense, can I be blinded? Okay. Okay, well, I guess I wouldn't know this. His went into the water? Okay, can I use the Light cantrip and see if I can make some light in the darkness? Or wait. Because I'm a Light Bearer. Okay, I don't know if I can still do this as a bonus action. Can I try to slowly move us a little forward? Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah that's my turn. All right. Yeah, I'm going to try to-- Maneuver around. 19. I did. 19. I pull out a torch. 16. I'll go behind Nott. I'm always a fan of the rears. So that's what's up ahead? I'm just going to run across. I'm just going to run across and pick up Nott on the way. Uh-huh. Yeah, that just hits. Fuck! Maybe nobody else do that. Do you want it? To see from the top? I feel like that goes in the hole. I have some potions. (singing) Get it girl, get it, get it girl. I'll take back. Just the tip of it. She cast it on me, too? Tight. What was underneath the urn in the ceiling? On the ground? Is there any way to see what is in the urns? Like just have a peeksies. Can I just, with my sword, just a little. Uh-oh. Seven. I think it's trash. Yeah. It's garbage. Okay. Wait. Yeah, okay. Do I get a saving throw? I'm going to die. That's better. Thank you. Oh my god. Now that I know it's there. Not a surprise. 10. This is where we walked in from? I'm going to get a little closer to the one that's near Nott. Pulled out, so I would like to rage. You can use reckless while you're raging? Okay, that's fine. I want to get this all figured out so we won't always have question time. Can I also use Divine Fury? So I roll twice? 25? Ah! What do I-- Plus what? Say again? Which is another d6, plus half-- I don't want to. (counting) 18. The damage that I chose was necrotic. Six plus half my barbarian level, which would be two, so 18 damage. Bonus attack? Not bonus, but do I have a bonus? Can I do Healing Hands on Nott? Oh, that's your bonus. Copy that. Got it. Yep, that's my turn. Wait-- yes, I'm going to stay there. Can I dig through one of the ashes? The urn? Still garbage? Whoopsies. I'm going to take a rope out of my bag and wrap it around a pillar. Can I throw the torch down there? Fjord. I put a rope down. No, I don't! Listen, she has a whole duffel bag. Listen! I like to have all my options. It's not all my fault. Thank you. I need better organization. All right, I'll give it a try. 12. I don't want to! Kill the box, Jester. Lady. I think. Slap-a the bass! It's a weird feeling? Your right. Okay. I'm going to rage? I would like to rage. Well wait, maybe I don't really need to do that because we have advantage anyway. Divine Fury. Yep. I'm going to do that again. Eight! It still hits?! 17. It is? 17. Yeah. Wait. 21. Nothing. It did? Okay. But what-- I don't see anything happening! Did it change shape at all? I'm going to back up a little bit. Yeah. Nicely done! Wait, don't you get an advant-- no. Wait, but she wasn't that close to him! Shit. Wait, didn't you get Sentinel on it? All right, I'm going to go up to it. Get it sliced. Raging, reckless. Divine-- no, I can't do divine. Every turn I can do it. Oh! First roll to hit. With advantage. Yeah, 20. Don't ever not do it, okay. 22. Yes! I take the tip of the sword, and I slowly start pushing into the middle and then (sword slicing across). The "werbage". (laughter) Wait, are they already filled with ash? Right now? Yep. Sword at the ready. I walk up behind Fjord. I was sitting in the tavern and then you guys came into the tavern. Yes, Nott, I did. I happen to-- no, Nott, I did not know. I can't tell you that, Nott. Yes, of course. Okay. Good call, Molly. I'll go look at another one. I got 17. Are we near the table at all? How close to the table can we get? I don't want to wait a week! I don't want to wait a week, I want to do it right now!
