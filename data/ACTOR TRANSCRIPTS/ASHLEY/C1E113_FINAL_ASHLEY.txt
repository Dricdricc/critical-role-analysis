So glad. I missed you. Everybody. I'd be okay with it. You have a t-shirt. I just didn't want to come. I've just got other things to do. Shop online. I'm just busy, guys. Looking at Cute Emergency on Twitter, there's just so many more important things to do than this. Just kidding, that's not true. Oh really? That makes me so glad. We love aminals. But then Vax won't be in the-- Oh good idea. I can now. Well it's for ten minutes. I don't know where they are! Oh, thank you, Grog. I feel like I'd be pretty proficient because it takes the strength to do it? I've got it. Tell him to just shake his head. Yes. Oh, you're so welcome. How will he know which is which? It's okay. It's done. I have a shield of fire resistance. Fuck. Together. TALIESIN and I feel like I don't want to go to sleep. Yeah. That's true. 18. Well, would I be Pike without rolling shit initiative? Yes. A six. Nope. Clanky twins! Boots!? Wait, wait. Do you have a name for him? Do you have a name? That's true. I just love animals. I'm just looking for my tens! Wait, are these 12s? So glad I'm here to be useful. I really thought I was going to roll two tens. I rolled the wrong, I actually rolled the wrong tens. You do. To mitheens. 18. No, I did it wrong. Yeah. 12. 22. (airhorn sounds) They're dead! We did it! There's a window. Because we can't see around there, I'm going to use it as a reference photo. I'm behind my boy Grog. My boy Blue! Guys, do not worry! We have an extra plus two to our hit points! It's going to be fine! 15 for Pike. But it wasn't in the thing. Let's have a little fun. Maybe you can try to get through to it. I have an idea. Yes! All of it! Can I get upstairs? Stay hidden somewhere's enough? I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope. Choose everyone that I see. Choose any number of creatures within range. Yes. I can see Grog. You have advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws. I'm also, as a bonus action, going to cast Sanctuary on Vex. It's a bonus action. Am I able to get hidden around the wall? Is the roof off of it? Once they're gone they're gone? Wait, from what? What is it? Good job. What does that mean? Yes! Yeah you are. Get that snatch. It can also be a Halloween costume. How far away is he? Okay. I'm going to-- I'm trying to think of what I should do. Okay, I'm going to try to Guiding Bolt it. Yeah. 18. I'm going to use Guided Strike. Which adds plus ten, so 28. Yeah. Guided Strike is for myself, War God's Blessing is somebody else. I'm going to do it at 3rd level, so that's four, 6d6. Okay, 23. Let me see. My bonus actions. Ugh, I don't want to use that in case. Okay, that's it. Because of-- You could certainly try. Yeah. 21. How many of them? About 30? Yeah, I'll take out my Mace of Disruption. I don't want to use any more spells. Do I want to wait? Well, I have another one. So I can do it now, yeah. It's not written down. I am? I didn't know that. Fuck off, I didn't know! I do. I do, but it depends on the roll. Yeah, so if I roll bad, or-- Yeah, I'll do Mass Cure Wounds on you guys. Who's bad? You're bad? Who else? Okay, is anybody down? I'm going to do Prayer of Healing. I want to save Mass Cure Wounds. Okay, I'll just use a 2nd-level for 16 points of healing for six people who need it. Splots! Wait a second. One of us is without Freedom of Movement. Understand. I don't have another 4th-level, unless I burn a 5th-level, for Death Ward. Does anybody else want Death Ward? I have my armor. I cast Death Ward on Scanlan. Scanlan, if we get through this, you know what that means, don't you? You'll just have to live. You wait and find out. Just live! You'll see! Let's do it. Freedom of Movement on Vex, Grog, and Pike. Death Ward at a 5th-level. And I will invoke the Blessing of the Everlight. (squealing) Okay! Thank you! What do they look like up there when their helmets came off? I think it's an illusion. I'm hoping. I don't know. I feel this can't be real. I'm going in. Can I stand over one of the bodies and do a perception check? A medicine check? 23. No! I stand in front of him and say no! Please don't! I take my mace, and I slowly try to take one of the bands off. Yeah, but not touching it, scraping it off. Does anything happen? Does Gilmore look like he's still alive? I'll do the same thing. It's okay. I stand over Kaylie and I cast Revivify. I stand over Cassandra and I cast Revivify. I don't know yet. I don't know the schedule.
