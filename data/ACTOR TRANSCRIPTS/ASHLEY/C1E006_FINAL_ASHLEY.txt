Hey, that's me! I think we're all good. Where's everybody at in terms of... You mean like in life, or? We shall! He also ate those brains. Helped him a little bit? He's just always a little weezy. LAURA & Oh, it's so hot! I'm sweating! No, I'll keep it on just for safety. No, it's fine Scanlan. Yeah, it’s okay. I'll keep it on. Just a water bottle. That sounds cool! Like Tremors? 7. (laughs) (quietly)...of secrets? I’ve definitely been here in my vision. (all laugh) Do we know what else is around? What was the building again? With the-- So what we’re looking at is the fortress? So this is a whole little city down here. Yeah, you guys real stealthy, so-- --Probably smart that you're moving ahead. Come on, Trinket. Oh, Scanlan! 19. Oh my god, that's so good. The thing in the red rider wagon. Wait, wait, I go and-- --I grab Scanlan and I kiss him on the cheek and make him stay. (all gasp and exclaim) Persuasion? That would be... Wait, is it a fail? It is a 1? Perception? 14? Have a sip sip. Oh, delicious. Oh no, I'm drunk! Just kidding. (all laugh) Keep trucking on. Well, you just, you know, you weren't paying attention. No, I think you were moving along to try to go stealth and sometimes you should just stay put and see what happens. (all laugh) 3. Oh! I get to do plus 10 bonus to that? 13! I'm not stealthy, man. You want to give it a go? Wait! I have - okay wait. We're just going to fling them off of the roof? What if it brings attention? There's something I've been wanting to do. They were switching shifts. All right, let's do it. Yeah! I'm a-coming up there to kill some - some things. (all laugh) I have a grappling hook. Not really, but let's just wing it! Okay. all right. I can take one if you can take one. All right. The Dimension Door? (singing) I'm making a note here. Oh! I didn't have to do anything, Scanlan! Well, let’s just wait until we’re out of danger. But that was really hot! It was. Let’s just-- Is he already dying, or no? He’s in the lava? Oh my god. Remember you killed that kid one time? Come on! This is quite a good read! Someone shoot him in the mouth. Oh, this is brutal! How far of a jump down is it? Should we call Grog? Oh yeah, Dimension Door! We could try to stay and fight? Turn into a duergar? Yeah, let’s get out. Does it stop the magma? Where did you get that chicken? Awesome. I'll do it! I'll do it. (all laugh) I'll assist. Okay. Where's he at? I want to create a spiritual weapon, like a poisonous lasso, and (whiff SFX) and then put him down into the lava. An attack roll? Which is? 10. I think so. (all laugh) I rolled a 2, and then I have a plus 8. I was just kidding! I was just getting a little crazy with ideas. Fuck. (laughs) Poisoning that wall, effectively. Gosh dang it. That would have been cool. What's your athletics? We're really rolling well tonight. Pew pew! What are we doing? Get it. I love Bad News. Just bear-ly. Pike grew up in the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather, Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream. A dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar) (wet smack sounds) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready. King Myrtle? I'll head on out there. He could just clear this whole place by himself. Let’s head down there. I’m going to head down there. Oh. 19. Getting a handle on my armor. 19. I have to roll again? (laughs) I rolled an 8. Plus nothing. (all laugh) (laughing) Oh my God. Can I do a Mass Cure on them? Okay. I'll do that. I'm just, you know, preparing. Is he in a cell? He's protecting the cells. 7. Oh, it's like a torture chamber? Oh, I love this so much. He rolled really high. I scream out, "Good job Grog! That's your best one yet!" Wait, is he dead? (all laugh) Who is she? Insight? 15! 15? 15? 18 is better. How hurt is she? Earmuffs. I'm going to heal her a little bit more. I'll put my hands on her. I'm sorry. You're not fully healed, let me help you out. Uh... My mace? What do you need it for? (all laugh) I don't know. This is all I have to protect myself. All right, well, I also have a morningstar, but this is-- (all laugh) That was rude. I don't like her. I'm sorry I questioned you. You're very welcome. I'm sorry I questioned you. Well, I have. Plus, plus, uh... hold on. (all laugh) War God's Blessing! No, I can't do that, because that's when a person makes an attack roll. (all laugh) Wait, dang it! I wanted to take some torture weapons! Yeah, can I go back since we have ten minutes and go get some torture weapons? No! Just for Grog! (hissing) Okay, wait, hold on. Lengthy hand-razor... Wait, what was the first one? Whoo! I mean, it's a good workout after all this food. Burn some calories...
