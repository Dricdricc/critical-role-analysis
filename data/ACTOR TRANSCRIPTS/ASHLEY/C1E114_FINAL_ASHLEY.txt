Oh no, I'm already crying! We haven't started! Wait, can you hear me? Before we go out there, let's hold hands real quick. Just know, I love you guys so much and you're my family. We're going to make it through this, okay? I'm going to cast Holy Aura on everybody. Okay, basically, if you stay within 30 feet of me-- I can't even read this because my eyes are watering. You have advantage on all saving throws and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls. When a fiend or undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the Aura flashes a brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends. 25. I'm going to be close to Grog, too. I just see a lot of swirls. Holy crap. Two! (laughter) Off to a good start. 20. Not a natural 20, but 19 plus one. Wait, what kind of damage was this? I have resistance to bludgeoning. Okay. 22. Oh wait, did you say anyone who's flying doesn't have to-- That's cool. Yeah. I got you, boo. Okay. Is everybody 30 feet of me? Because I can't really see the-- So can I fly where I'm in the middle of Scanlan, Percy, Vex, and Keyleth somehow? Within 30 feet of everybody. Maybe not over the little crescent. Crevice is what I mean. Okay. And I'm going to cast Mass Cure Wounds. 30 feet. Rolling now. Sorry, guys, sorry. Wait, what's my spellcasting ability modifier? Why am I blanking? Yes. I think it's 29. Oh, no, I didn't. Wow, I didn't know that was a thing too. Oh, yes. Okay. I'd like to move again. Probably. Know what? I'm going to stay because I don't know what my fucking speed is because I'm panicking now. I actually don't think I have that sheet. Let's see here. Yeah, okay. So I am going to cast Shield of Faith onto Vex, which gives a plus two bonus to AC. You're welcome! Yeah, I forgot to get that sheet when I was home, of the Blessing of the-- wings. Wonderful wings. Okay. Let me find it. Come on. Get that bitch. Come on! Healing potion? Okay! So I'm going to-- Tried and true right now. I'm going to Guiding Bolt at 6th-level. Can I fly close to start? Might as well. A natural 20. I fucking did. (laughter) I'm taking a picture of this right now. Not nine? Oh, big money. Oh shit, that's really big money. Okay, hold on. Oh my god, I'm shaking so bad you guys. Okay. Hold on. (sighs) Hold on. Sorry, I keep losing count. I'm sorry. I'm so nervous. Okay. 36. Wait, I miscalculated. It's 37. Is that what I said? Yeah. Am I able to move back down closer to Scanlan? Oh. Okay. I'm not terrible, but let me do-- shit. I'm not. Okay, I'm going to Healing Word two. For Scanlan. Okay, fuck it. For Grog! 15, Grog. Plus ten! To Grog, yeah. We can fix her later. Yeah. I love you guys. That's my boy, Grog! Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Is there somewhere I can get where I can be within 60 feet range of everybody? In a middle spot? Okay, I'm going to do it! It's time for Mass Heal, which is 700 hit points spread out. Nine. Okay, so. Zahra and Kashaw, I love you both-- Okay. But I'm going to give-- all of us get 100 apiece. (cheering) You get a hundred, and you get a hundred! Just a skosh? Trying to think if I should move a little bit. Yeah, I'm going to try to get out of range of him and closer to my peeps. Oh, maybe, you know what? I'm going to hang out right there, maybe. Oh wait, wait, wait! Is there anyone-- can I touch Grog, or is there anybody I'm near? No, I know, but is there anybody that I can touch? Yeah, I have a little cantrip that I was going to use, but-- Oh no, never mind, it's not a bonus. Never mind. They're going to be in there for a minute. Nobody wants that dragon in the window. Does anybody get an advantage after the Guiding Bolt? That's so many 9th-levels, yo! Is this also for people flying? Is the fire halved because of the--? And what was the fire again? I'm so sorry. So 72. 36. Is he looking rough? (laughter) What do I get? A d4? All right. Mass Cure Wounds. Yes. Am I within 60 feet-- Percy, Scanlan, Vex? Great. Done. Doing it. 40 points. 40. I still wanted to move a bit and do a bonus. Could I hover on top of land? I want to stay in the air, but hover on top of land, please. I want to stay the same height, but if for some reason I fell, there would be land. And then as a bonus action, I'm going to take a superior healing potion that I have. And that will be my turn. 106. Oh, come on. Come on, baby. Okay, how far am I from my best pal Grog? Can I get to him? Fuck. Can I also pass him something when I'm there? Yeah, okay, so I'm going to fly up as far as I can. I'm going to hold out the trammel and stick it-- what? No? Yeah. That's all I can do, right? Can I hand him the trammel? Fuck. Okay, I will also cast Guidance on Grog. Before the spell ends, a target can roll a d4. Add the roll to one ability check. Yeah. Wait, would stun be affected by Freedom of Movement? Or vice versa? That's okay. It's okay. I'm at 106. No. Let's not do it. Okay. Passing over the trammel to Grog, is that a bonus action, or that's my action? Because I'm right next to him? Okay. Because I was going to also try something else, but I don't know if I can. I was also going to try to clasp my holy symbol and try to see if I can do Divine Intervention. Six? All right, I'll pass the trammel to Grog. Can't use it for that. Can I subtract whatever I roll for the inspiration? Yeah, reverse math. (laughs) I have a question. Has Vecna still been healing with each round? That was crazy. I was getting a tissue, and I dropped a fork. I don't know. I don't think so. Okay. Am I close to Keyleth at all? Okay. I'm going to float by Keyleth. I'm going to float by Keyleth. Cast Guidance on her. And as a bonus action, cast Sanctuary on her. Yes. Can I move again? I want to move close to Grog. Yeah. I fly up next to Grog, and if he has a free hand, I hold the other hand. Am I rolling, as well? Ugh. Matt! I don't have to work tomorrow. (cheering)
