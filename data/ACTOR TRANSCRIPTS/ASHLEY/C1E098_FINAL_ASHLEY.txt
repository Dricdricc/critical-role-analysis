Yeah! Yes, please. Hey! I know, you guys, I won't be there, so. I just think it's rather rude that she doesn't want to come down here and meet us. Forever? She said she's under the weather. What's wrong? I know my beauty regimen's changed. Look at me. 142. No. I forgot my birthday. I don't know how old I am. No. I think it's in the 30s. Right? Yeah. Twinsies! I'm in front of Grog. A kaiju from the deep! A level seven! I feel inspired. I like this. Yeah, Shiraz time. Well, you said you have things that will fuck you up right, so what would that be considered? Bring it! As a matter of fact, I want two of whatever that is. Well, that's not up for you to decide, my friend. I get on my earring. Hey, String Bean, your drink is here. Well, I can't make any promises. This one. Take a sip. It's very thick. I'm sipping it. I'm doing as the locals do. Enjoying it how he told me. It burns! Ugh! (slurring words) Should we sent him a Change-Bringer's Nectar? Oh no! (still slurring) I only had like three drinks. Three sips. They were so small. Okay. Maybe some meat pie. Let me see if I know. Will I know the Change-Bringer? I'm going to see if I can think of it. 14. It sounded so fancy. Do you want a sip of Change-Bringer's Nectar? Loosey-goosey. Is this good? Tell her she has nice boots, Grog. Tell her she has nice boots. I'll be your Cyrano! Maybe you should cheers him from afar so he can see you're drinking it. You won't find anybody as good as us. I think you should marry whoever you want. So that's what I think we should do. Yes. Yea. I vote yea. No, it's right here. We can talk to the dead. I have it. Like something was eating them? Okay. We only see the one body? Yes. Okay, I get three questions. Five questions. Good day, sir. It's not a good day for you. Sorry. What happened to you? What did the skittering beasts look like? (whispering) It's like spiders. Is there anyone else alive? Oh, yeah that's a good question. (louder) Was there anything that you guys could tell of your knowledge-- did anything seem to damage it or work against it? Oh. The skittering creature or the big thing? Both, because we still have-- Against them! Against the skittering creatures Okay. Oh god, this is not-- (whispering) Wait, he said they spit? Is there anything that you can tell us about the smaller one? A baby, like a baby? So it's like this and then the little baby thing at the bottom? But do we know why the baby woke up? What woke the baby? We didn't ask that? Okay. They did something in the mine that awoke it. And we can redo it. Oh! Heroes' Feast. LAURA and Wait, 19 extra? (singing) Jump! For my love. I mean, you could technically just go on it alone and I could-- Hop on Vax's back. That's ridiculous. 28! Can we see any little creature in the middle of anything? 25 for perception. Dwarvish. Gnomish. So this is the opening of-- this is where it was. Jeez. 20. What did you get? You got a 25, okay. Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope. Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope. And for my bonus action, I'm going to pull out a spiritual weapon of a giant big greatsword. Right in front of the baby! Yeah. Oh, but I don't know if I want to hurt the baby. Did you do any damage? Oh, that's not very good. 13. Stupid piece of dice crap. No, I'm going to stay. I'm going to stay. Because we're on the carpet, right? Grog, Percy, and I on the carpet? You're not on the carpet anymore? Oh, the three of us. I'm going to stay on the carpet. Yes. Natural 20. One! 21! What? Okay. Fucking fuck. Five. Yes. He has a dirty diaper. He's mad. Wait! Can I War God's Blessing? Let's see. 30 feet? Parkour! All right. If I climb down there, it's an athletics thing? Oh, okay. I'll climb down. Okay. Yeah. Wait! I have Feather Fall with my shield. Okay. Is that just my action? Okay. How close am I to the baby? Can I get to the baby? All right. So you know what? I'm going to (sings) Guiding Bolt the baby! Let's do five. 5th-level. It's not enough I don't think. 19? I will use Guided Strike. Yep. How many sixes? Let's see. I'll get five, six, seven, eight. Okay, so we've got six, 12. Help me out here, guys. 18. Oh, wow. Whoa! 42. We choose to kill this celestial baby not because it is easy, but because it is hard! Do I still have a bonus action? I'll use the spiritual weapon. Oh crap, my boots are stuck together. How is this happening? Okay. Yeah, the hook on the top there. Ooh. That's a 29. Sorry, guys. I don't know what I'm doing. Oh, that's not a lot. Seven. 11. 96, you said? Above a fountain. Yeah, I'm fine! 18. I'm on the carpet. I'm okay. I know. Oh! Natural 20. Eight. I was going to see if I could put a Blade Barrier on top of the hole, so once the fire's in there, they can't get out. 90 feet. I don't think it says. Oh, it does say. Yeah, ringed wall up to 60 feet. 11. Was he an evil baby?
