I have, and I may have one. I almost wore it tonight, but it is in the dirty hamper. It's so good. I think I'm okay. I did. I think I'm okay, though. Me, too. I know we have been here this whole time, but thank you for instilling confidence in me yet again. Love you, Grog. Are you scared? I just see big guys. But I guess everybody looks big to me. (laughter) I smack him on the butt. Go get them. 20! That's okay. I'm almost there! 23. I want to attack them so bad, but I know we need to go. You had to roll for both of us? I love you guys. Please come back. My hand, and it made a farting noise, sorry. This is so stressful! No, don't do it! What's it saying? What does it want from you in return? Okay. Desperate times come for desperate measures. Call for desperate measures, rather. Here's the thing if it comes down to it, it gets bad, I can pull you out of there, hopefully. It's not off to a good start. You slashed up Vex. I could send a message. Well, I could use Sending. Yeah. And we could write a little something and say hello. Well, I have it. Let's look at this. Yeah, put a kiss on it. Do a naughty doodle? Okay. Okay. I can't draw, but all right. (laughter) Oh my gosh. This is already going bad. Okay. I can't draw, and if only one of the amazing artists were here. So okay, it's a penis. (laughter) SAM and "--4 a good time." Wait, but how do we know for sure? I'm not going to stay if he doesn't want me to stay. Don't you do anything else! You just strangle him until he dies, and then you leave him alone. (laughter) Yes. I'm going to honor your wishes, Vax. I'm going to go swim. I'm peeking out of the pond. Is it bad if we set up camp right here? I'm going to go over by Vax's armor and stuff. Just sit there and flop it around. No. It's not a cleric spell. (sighs of relief)
