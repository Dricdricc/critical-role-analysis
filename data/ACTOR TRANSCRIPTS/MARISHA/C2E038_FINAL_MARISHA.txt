What was the last one? What's B? It's fine, we're gods! I'll be behind Jester. I'll be behind Jester, yeah, or with Jester. (sneezes) 29. Did you get a haircut? It looks good! Jackpot. You got any of that rogue shit? Hey, can you do that on multiple things at a time? That seems excessive. Just a thing that was given to me. A feather from Nila, forever ago. I don't know, I'm just saying it might be magical. Magic feather. Maybe it makes me fly. Oh that's right, you didn't meet Nila. Yeah, she looked like Caduceus. Yeah. Oh sorry. I walk over. Hey, are we whispering? Oh sorry. Sorry, we're whispering. You never show people their stolen mail. Don't. Absolutely not. Keep that shit on lock. I scan the forest. Are we being followed? Fuck, balls, shit, six. So foggy. She booped you. Nope. Another stealth check. (pigeon cooing) 19. Ew. Twist! Still a twist! Why? Because it's so hot? MATT and Jeez, that was so close. Nine. TRAVIS and Is it just so hot? What's happening? Is it bugs? Am I close enough to where I can overhear this? Sorry. I go over to Fjord while we're taking a break. Hey, did you find anything out from Avantika? About, you know, shit that you guys have in common? Does she believe it, though? But does she believe that she's a zealot, like connected to some god. How are you feeling from last night? Seemed like you had a rough night. All right. Did you ever read any horror stories as a kid or did you and your friends tell horror stories? Spooky things? You know how there's always a time where the narrator stops, lets your imagination run wild with what happens? I just wanted to say. People might have ideas and thoughts, and I'm trying to look out for you because we said we'd have each other's backs. Sometimes the less you say, the more people's minds like to fill in the blanks. From what I've learned, generally, what's in people's heads is worse than the reality of the situation. I mean, look, we've seen you do some weird, fucked up shit, right? So any time you're unsure it's going to make other people even more unsure, with a layer of suspicion. It's like a tiramisu of confusion. No pressure. Let's go fight some snake people. I agree. And I walk up. No, why are you following me? Why are you doing this? How many? I duck down, I turn to the rest of the group, and I say (whispering) Snake. Four of them. Shields. Weapons. I direct the group and I say You flank this way, and then you guys flank that way. We flank around. (whispering) I tell them to hold. We duck. And watching. So it's snakes versus lizards, right? Yeah. We didn't punch our way through shit! Oh my god! I turn around and I say Do we have anything that resists poison or venom? Caduceus, you raised your hand. I feel like maybe with these people we should have a frontline party and a backline party. And maybe a little frontline poison resistance could be good. No! I don't mind going in front, mainly because I have no fucking range. Can we do that? But if we give the, "We're stage whispering!" Just saying, these guys clearly have reach and I don't think we want to have all of us tangle with them. You're so heal-y, yeah! I'm not going to volunteer to speak for anybody, but I know I'm better when I'm up in close. Could you give the both of us resistance? Yasha can look behind. (whispering) Yasha! Behind! Football tackled, just gone, okay. It's a leopard with snakes! Wait, what? What do you mean, we don't hear anything? You said we heard through the bubble! Wow. Cool. 18. You know what, Fjord? I think Jester is a little jealous. Just throwing it out there. Shit, are you fucking serious right now? (intone "Semi-Charmed Life") She's unconscious?! Going for a nighttime stroll. (singing) Danger zone! It's real fun playing a character when you don't have their sheet. Oh my pillow-- ah! Then I just run and I say Nott! Duck! I jump over Nott and I'm going for this one in the back, 45-speed. Yeah, that one in the back. The one that Fjord's been shooting at. Yeah, 25. I'm going to come down, big Iron Man three-point landing, punch to its face. Wow. Cool. Cool story, bro. 12? I crack my knuckles on a rock and I'm like Ah! And I roundhouse kick it with my second attack. That's better. That's a 22. Wow, that's super great. Five points. Then I'm going to go ahead and-- I hit it, so I can do stunning-- no, I need to hit it twice for stunning strike, right? Just once? Can I stun it? I'm going to spend another ki point and do flurry of blows for my bonus action. And do pop pop, two more punches. First attack. I'll take that natural 17, which I'm pretty sure hits for nine damage, and then second attack is a natural 20. Thank you, Gil. Roll two dice. That's double sixes! That's 12 plus four. No, wait. I double my die roll. I only roll once. Sorry, 16 points of damage plus four, so 20 points of damage. Wait. No, 16 points of damage. Math! Yes. Was I in that? Or no? 13. Mom's Jamedi. (laughter) Get it, Fjord. Wait, who? All of us? Three. Ten. Start them going. Does everything in this jungle have snake heads? Don't do it. Unrealistic. Have you never seen an owl before? Mm-hmm. It's pretty cute. Really? Hey, Avantika. How many dudes you think you killed? Yeah. Oh. That's awesome. Yeah, that's a big number. We can't relate at all, nope. The One Ounce Owl? They know where we are. They can ambush us. Okay. Following Jester's lead-- It's not great. Nine. Good enough. Oh no god! Halloween! It needs to be all the time. It's like a synth wave album. Ah? Nope. I'm great. 33. We were yeah. Okay. Remember if anything goes down, Fjord and I will take point. Caduceus, I noticed before it seemed like you guys were poisoned immediately, but not lingering? Are you? I'm not, like, saying anything. What? Nope! Yep! Nope. Great. Yeah. Fuck you. Do you see red stripes? I feel stripey, I don't know why. I'm great. I'm awesome. Are you itchy? (sulky) No. (sulkier) No. Yeah, you smell bad. Don't touch me. I get that a lot. I'm diseased! Oh great! No. I just-- That's okay. It's the con plague. We just got back from New York. I'm always careful with what I touch. I've... Let's just keep moving. Jester. I can't. Okay. You know what, maybe I could go with them. Such a bitch. Sucks. Saying that as a person. I'm just commiserating. Moving on. I was, yeah. How about I go with these guys, with Jamedi and Avantika? Three is a small group. Okay, so-- If Caleb and I move together, you have your Message spell that you can send back and forth to Nott. Oh, that's what we're doing? Maybe we do the live bait thing, I don't know. Maybe. Okay, okay. That's a lot of people. State fair, all the way. Polio? I lean in and say, Are we whispering now? We whispering again? What? The dead-low? Is he on speakerphone? Whose side are you on? Hey, Fjord. Avantika can go invisible or peek into what we're saying. Can you do that? How much have you heard? Hang on, hang on, real quick (clearing throat) Real talk, for just a second. If Yasha comes with us, and we puppet her, and she dies, Ashley's going to be real mad. Just pointing this out last time, because we did this with Pike. Not saying one way or the other! Just saying, we're going to continue on with Yasha? Okay. Done. Done. That's all I'm going to say. Fuck! 20. Agreed. No, we're in the middle. We're Assassin's Creeding it. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'll be the barrier. Aww, yeah! I see. So it's like a cross-T intersection? On this T intersection? Four-way stop. Okay, guru Liam. Yeah. Liam from Ojai. Can I see the tower-- the temple at all, above the buildings? Okay, does this curve look like we're still heading the right way? Run. Pull them off the street. Pull them off the street. Weekend at Bernie's. Should we kill them? He kills one guy. I snap the other guy's neck. You said one saved? Great, so let's just fucking kill really stealthily really fast! 24. Six damage; I'm going to stun him. God, go. Does he see us? You're supposed to be better at this. Throat punch! Uh-huh, 15. Stun. Uh-huh, he's stunned. I pull out all of the cherry bombs that I have and I go-- fucking fireworks! Yeah, what do you mean towards us? Oh shit. Run, run, run! 22. It was super down the middle. What do you mean? No, I know what you mean. Oh my god, yes! Is there anyone following us? Okay. 15. Stealth you said? Oh god. 12. So wait, you said that there are tablets with rings on the corners of the tablet and splatter-- Yeah, super sacrifice-y. Where's Avantika? Bullshit. Are you lying? God fucking bull fucking shit. Nine. Goggles. Oh my god! Yeah! It's so Indiana Jones! This is so Nathan Drake! The rubies have a purpose, I know it!
