I'm Lisa Frank Castle. Thank you. You look like you're trying to sell baked beans. I know. We were in London two days ago. It was fun. I was honored. I was going to say, it was from the flames. We sleep longer. The legendary Frank Miller. And of course, Arsequeef. What's Avantika doing? How do they make you sound differently? It feels like you sound different because of the gloves. I think it's just in my head. Yeah. You're being super aggro. It's intense. I want to go over to Avantika. Do I see anything else tucked up under there while she is doing that that looks of interest or of importance? Okay, okay. 19. On the lantern? Like a phoenix? Amber eyes for the second. What about the third? I'll go over and look at the far mural. The quinoa? I walk up behind her and I go, huh! Yeah. Yeah, I don't actually push her in but I just want to freak her out. Eh! Salt water? Maybe it's not all here. Maybe it's in another location. Maybe there are two other temples. I stand with Jester at the edge of the pool, looking down. What the hell happened? All right, let's go. Right. Hang on. I do. What? Oh, wait, can you open it? Okay, let's go. Come on. Yeah. Yeah, I can do that. Let's go. Sure. Give me a boost, the cheerleader hoist? Jesus Christ! 12 on my acrobatics. It's really slippy. 20. Jester-- Good times. Everyone hates the underwater levels. Didn't we have some water breathing potions? Somewhere? Okay. Yeah, we're definitely underwater. Do we see the entrance or exit ahead of us? So, if we just book it, we'll go-- We're just going to have these guys-- Well, I'm a human with no magical abilities, so I'm going to run. I can't do a whole lot. (pitiful noise of a throwing star flying uselessly through water) Uh huh. I'm swimming up. I'm going to spend a ki point to do Step of the Wind. You have five? Total? Okay, what do I see? Where am I? Quick look around! The water's still filling? I'm going to keep moving upwards, and while I'm doing that, I want to take out the 50-foot rope we have. Then I want to grab something heavy that I have. I've got to have something stupid and heavy that I don't care about, and I want to tie it to the other end. A crowbar! I take the crowbar and then tie it, and I drop it down the well with the rope. Uh-huh. I want to take the rope and double-grab it around me and keep hauling ass up the stairs. Fuck! It's locked? Is there a key? Where's the key? Jester has the key! Go Jester, go Jester, go! He selfishly wants the door unlocked-- Take one last deep breath. Going to drop down and going to use that-- nope, the rope is attached to me. Going to drop down and see if I can go for Jester. Yeah, can I take her and yank her up with me? Sure. My last ki point. That helps. Whatever I can do, I guess. No, you were below me, I think. That's good. That's nice of them. (groaning) Oh god! Take Cad, take Cad! I'm good! It ends with the mob of angry people who want to kill us, probably? But I don't know if you're making death saves. Is he stable? How the fuck do we get out of this? Haul ass. 24. Turtle! It's only a turtle! Natural 20! Might as well go with the flow. Keep moving. Run. Six rounds? Is there anyone tracking us pretty closely yet? I'm going to take the rest of my ball bearings and dump them out as we run. Nott, do you have anything you want to offer? I don't know if any of my ideas are good. I've got an oil flask. I could drop down some fire but don't think it would work well either. I go Fluffernutter! and take my ninja star and go (floof)! I don't have fire! I use my fists! I could have used the bottle rockets. (shouting) I think these are magic throwing stars! I think I bought magic throwing stars! What? Oh jeez. 11. I have these bottle rockets, if you can Mage Hand them away and distract them away from us with another popping sound. Well, I can light them, you throw, and you take it further. Okay. We'll call it-- Well gee, when you put it like that. I don't know, I feel deeply shamed by my suggestion now. I know, you just don't have a lot, you've used all those things. Okay, okay, okay, okay. 20, total? I want to-- We're all clear? At the rowboat? How close are they? Yeah. I'm on the edge, doing polearm duty, like croc hunting. (grunting) Yeah. Not feeling that whole time. I've never felt more useless. Curse you! Yeah! Yeah, do we just collapse-- of exhaustion as soon as we hit the deck? Oh, cool. Yeah... It got uncomfortable-- You have clothes underneath your-- fiber! Little hearts! Sorry, I thought that was hypothetical and that we were-- talk about that later, which we should do. I'll be right back. You guys find a spot, I'll meet you there. I go back and I go, Jeremiah! Give me that. I take bread or whatever he has prepared. Yep, Jeremiah. Hi. Beau. What do you have right now? Something ready? I want to chew on something while we talk. Thank you. You have sausage to go with that? Water. Wine. Thank you, sorry, I'm just hungry as fuck. I go back to the group. I got appetizers. There you go. What the fuck actually happened down there? We haven't really gotten a clear description, and we're all confused. Yeah, we saw them. It connected to the pillars and then that's when everything started flooding. Then it was just running for our lives at that point. I don't know. I didn't see much else. There's also the temple where we found this thing that had the snake, the naga. What was the one that was inside of you? Is it the onyx one? It was the amber one. Oh shit! Is it the same color? So in the amber, it was the giant serpent with the tidal wave. So three murals. Three creatures-- beings. Three chosen ones. And three different eyes in each. Do I remember anything from hitting the books in school of some gods? It would be history and not religion? Well, they're the same for me. Same modifier. 17. Her-story! Big kaijus-kind of thing? I say all of that. I read this one paragraph once and then the filigree, there was a monk with a trumpet up his ass, and that's why I remembered this section so well. In fact, still remember the book. Bet if we go back to the library, we could still find it and we could figure out more about this. Speaking of choice, what's yours? It feels like she has bigger plans. The Divergence, yeah. I've actually had a good time. I've died a few times, but I'm great. She also seems very interested in you. And don't get me wrong, she's hot and all, but I question her motives. Feels like she's-- I don't know. I agree with that, and I think she's understood that her sexuality can be wielded as a weapon. Oh, that's fucking brutal. I don't think there's anything wrong with maybe asking for The Mist. I think maybe Caduceus has a good point, if we can convince her that we're still part of her crew by doing our own recon. We took all that time to learn how to sail the damn thing. Mm-hmm. Hee! That's awesome. Speaking of trouble, are you going to take her up on that glass of wine? That she has mentioned three times. (whispering) Fuck! Make a constitution check. Eyy! Aw, no, what?! Cheers! d8 for me as well. It's a d8 plus your constitution, yeah? Wow, that's a one. Do we still reroll ones? That's a two! Thanks. I rolled a two--
