Did you print out a picture of a bullet? I don't think that's-- I feel like you're reaching. Yeah, I'm a little tired. That's a lot of nicknames. Can we call you B.E.F. for short? Bird-Eye Fjord. I'll join you. Hey, Fjord. Hey, Fjord. Let me ask you something. I think I messed up. I think maybe I should apologize to Caleb. I'm not very good at apologizing, though. I was wondering if maybe you could give me some pointers for apologizing. You're being facetious, aren't you? I probably got a little too aggressive, probably shouldn't have grabbed him like that. Got a little too angry. That's not necessarily my good side, you know, don't like people seeing that. That I'm not good at apologies? I got a little too aggressive? And I have a bad side. And I shouldn't have done it. Is that pretty good? Oh, like Nott? A little person. Right, like in your soul. It's, you know, I want to try, I guess. Yeah, I think so. Hopefully it goes well. Oh, okay. Not like I'm sorry! Okay, that's good to know. Let's roll separately. Oof, terrible. Five. Five? Oh five! Ow! You think those guys have strong family bonds? I rolled a 20 total. That's 11 damage. My second attack missed. Wow. Yeah, you almost look innocent. Remember our swimming lesson? She can't go with us. So Descent-y, you guys! Are we going to try and wait in the water and ambush as we go? Okay. Okay. As a funnel? Might not be a bad idea. And I bet those things are pretty good swimmers. But faster than fish? She's going to rattle off some secrets. Natural 20! 37. I am one with the water. There it goes! 12. Wow, okay. Beau's up first. Are we just going to go for these guys? We're not going to do some sort of distraction? This is all water, I'm assuming, in the middle? Can I move? I'm going to go for this guy. Is there a way I can jump across and try and fight him from over here? Do I have enough? Okay, no. I'm going to try and do some KGB-level shit. I'm going to do a quick kidney punch and try and go for the temple. No, I'll be good. This is regular attacks, right? First attack. That was good. 20? Second attack. That's garbage, that's an eight. Eight damage. I'm going to spend a ki and do Flurry of Blows. Two unarmed strikes. Natural one. No, it does not. 24. Four damage. Wait, I rolled the wrong one. That's much better. Ten damage. I'm going to spend another ki point and do Stunning Strike. Jab to the ribs. You were supposed to go to sleep. Yeah. It'll be awesome when that Stunning Strike works. He got Tolled. 40 feet's huge. Like the harpoons? 17 is my armor class. So good at this. Just a straight check, or a saving throw? 19-- sorry, ten. It looked like a 19 upside down. Motherfucking druid fish. Saving throw. That's a natural one. I just got fucked up. Ah! Okay, I'm going to take the one who's got a trident jabbed into my shoulder. I'm going to grab the chain and I'm going to yank it towards me as I deck him in the face twice. The first attack-- Can I do that? Okay, the first one is 15? Woohoo! Okay, second attack; not as good, 12. Okay, that's seven damage. And then I am going to take my bonus and spend a ki point to do Patient Defense. A little in shock. (pants) Ah! (gasps) Misses. Just misses. You have such big hands. Ah! I'm unconscious. Again. Let's go cobalt blue. 17. (singing) That's amaze-balls! I'm going to try to still play dead. Thanks, Jester! On my back, out of air, I go That was awesome! I'm good. I'm still alive. And I get up. I go, (slurred) Who's-- who's next? And I run over-- I have 20 movement. Am I able to, if I use Step of the Wind, am I able to make it around and get to this one who's harrassing Caleb? 'Cause I'd have 20 more movement and then my speed, which is 40. So I should be able to make it. I am. Yeah, that's 15. Really? I've got extended melee. Come on, man. All right, two attacks. Let's see what happens. First one natural 20! (yelling) I hate fish. And then I'm going to take the end of my bo, jab it right in its throat, see if I can get another one. Ten. I think that's all I've got. Don't touch attacks avoid AC? Aw. Man, that's old school. Party's left. You were that bad? Wow. Do I have a reaction? Can I hit it? Yes, Sentinel shit! Terrible, terrible. That's a ten. You don't have a print-out of your character sheet? Oh, shit. Check the lollipop, it's so inviting! It looks great. It's me already? Oh, shit. I'm going to unleash on this guy. Again, crack, crack, see what happens. Oh, goodness gracious! Yes! I'm going to try and use my staff to pole vault me up in the air and go crack, crack, with two big swoopy swoops. I'll take the 13, eight plus six is 13. 14! That's eight plus another four so that's 12 damage for the first one. Second one. That hits, 18. Five damage. It's hurt. I have one more ki point. I can stun it, or I can do Flurry of Blows and try to kill it. All right, last ki point. Flurry of Blows. Hey Caleb, we should talk later. I'll take that 13, so it's 20 for the first attack. And then 12? No. Yes. No, 12. Stupid. Seven damage. I pole vault up, do the two hits, and then I want to parkour off of the spiritual weapon a little bit, Marty McFly on the lollipop, and then do a flying roundhouse to his face! I stand up, throw my hair out of my face, and that ends my turn. Oh no. 17 for me. I'm still up. Okay. (grunts) I'm a little out of-- it knocked the wind out of me. Okay, I'm going to go for this mother. I'm going to run up towards it, once again parkour off of that little-- yeah, and give a nice flying Superman punch and then an uppercut. First hit. All right, I'll take that 21. Okay. 16. That's ten damage. Second attack. 16 for the first one. 16 again total. 12 damage. And bonus attack. Not good. Nine to hit. (panting) I'm losing steam. That's my turn. We all went, "Whoa! Level three!" How do you want to sweet tooth this? A woman scorned by her dice. That will keep Caleb alive. Shallow priest? Beach priest. Oh god! You're cutting out, Fjord, I can't-- It's like this little dark cloud right over you. Yeah, it's a direction. It's not a cube around you, it's a-- you have to shoot it. Doing the Charleston. Look, there's condensation on the map. And your nails are amazing. So blue! I'm standing right there, so I'll get you up. Can I take your eight points? What if it does, you guys? That’d be so magical. You look pretty shitty, too. Your shave is still very nice, though. Caleb, do you-- yeah, all right. Can I take a short rest while everyone's doing this? You were waiting for it! I like having codenames. Do I see anything from Ioun? I hobble up, crack my rib back in place. Okay. You said investigation? Ten. It’s the rubber pencil trick. Can I look around on the walls and on the doors and, using my criminal background, see if I see anything that’s Thieves’ Cant or smuggling operation things? 23. We keep finding dead skeletons. Does the groove in it look like it matches the size of the blade of the sword? Yeah. An inch? It doesn't look like the gash in the orb is deeper than the length of the blade that's left, correct? The-- god damn it. But this was a different blade. There are two blades. But I'm just wondering if it fits. Never mind. Let him finish the damn spell. The sphere. The broken hilt. Stop! Con-cen-trate! Con-cen-trate! Yeah, I'll help Jester look around. Maybe we see a broken blade somewhere while he finishes that. Jester and I do a quick scan to see if we can find the broken blade. Do you see anything? Take advantage? A nine and a ten? It's okay. 15. What do you find out? (singing) Ooh, I want to dance with somebody. MARISHA, SAM, and Where's the orb? Are you clammy, a little warm? Like what? Yeah, do you feel any heartburn or any constipation? Because that thing was big, and it's-- Maybe if you concentrate on his idea, maybe you can feel him some way. Or maybe this thing is like a beacon to him? Maybe you're cursed. It's a trauma film, no! Sounds a lot like dying. A coup? Well, might be sooner rather than later, now. The pool water is salt water? I kind of agree with that. Well, this is all, from what I can recognize, deities that are not sanctioned by the empire. I mean, things that are wanted that are illegal are going to be wanted. It seems like there was clearly a high demand for some people to worship who they want to. Maybe they were gathering a bunch of these items because they were looking for the exact one for this one. Any dope bos? Bo staff? No, I have a staff. Can I assist him on that? You have assistance. Roll with advantage. Can I try and do it myself and do a ki point thing? Do you have boom sticks still? As long as we're not here. Who's got the sticks? We've got sticks. Light the damn sticks of dynamite! Just do it! What? While they bury bodies, I pull Caleb aside, and say hey, can I talk to you for five seconds? Ten, maybe, tops. 15. Okay, it might be more like 20 seconds. Will you give me 20 seconds? Over here? No, you know what, it's fine. I can say it in front of everybody. I'm sorry. I wanted to apologize for last night. I got a little aggressive, a little handsy. I shouldn't have done that, I was out of line, and I shouldn't have brought up your past shit. Sorry. See, 20 seconds, that was about right? That was good? I'm-- He's just staring at me. You saw the worst side of me-- I look at Fjord over my shoulder. I hug him back? Do I go like this? Was it? I don't know how I feel about that. Good talk, friend. Seriously though, friend? Ja? How do you say it? All right. And I walk away. Oh my goodness! I'm almost up to full now! It does.
