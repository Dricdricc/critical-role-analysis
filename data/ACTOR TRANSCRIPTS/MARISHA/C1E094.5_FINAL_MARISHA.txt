Weed and Sundry. Yeah. Everyone knows it's true. Everyone in this building knows it's true. We can turn it down more. Can we tilt down this red light more? So it's not in their eyes? Okay. Keep going. Woot. Angie Hill was on this week. Holy shit. She's a badass MMA fighter who always shows up to her weigh-ins in cosplay. She's dope. She's rad. Yeah, she came out, she drove up from San Diego, yeah. She's cool. So she was on the show. And guess who's up next week? No. Liam O'Brien. That guy! It's going to be awesome. We're going to have dinner-- no, he's going to have dinner in like POV. So, it's going to be you and then Talks at 7PM? Okay, because when I bought those for you, way before we even thought about having a show, back when we very first started dating, I'm pretty sure they just custom-made those. Julian custom-made those himself and just sold them. And now, I think, because-- Yeah, they're starting to make them on mass scale. Yeah. They're not my kids. You totally were! Thanks for coming. So maybe What Women Want? Oh, Annie era? Just google Ashley real quick, hang on. Are you Bones? Oh snap. Ashley's proficient in all weapons. I immediately grab his wrist. Who the fuck? What is-- Oh, you're from my future! Hi. It's Marisha. (brokenly) No! Not again! You're welcome. What? Who? Huh? Oh, it's glasses Matt! Oh my god! Yeah, nearing mullets phase. I'm in Kentucky at this phase! Taliesin! You look like a Ralph Bakshi cartoon! Fists, bra? Why are all the girls more developed? Is this indicative of puberty? Is this a statement? How many hit points do I have? No. Nine. Wait, is he not alive? Oh, right. Okay. I'll go over and be like, yo. We're kids! This is real! Me and Ashley (straining noises). Oh. Different universe! Different one! Nah, it's 420. We're cool. Yeah, we're with it. Yeah. Holy shit! Guys, why didn't we know each other when we were all this age? That sucks. (laughter) I was covering for friends' drug habits, so that's fine. Wait, we got pushed forward in time? We came from the future, though, right? DM? I mean, it sounds within the realm of something I'd do, but I don't have any-- No. Matt actually said I wasn't allowed to have a motorcycle. He's afraid I might kill myself. Did you sound like that at that age? Were you always-- I'm going to try and break off a sweet staff from a tree branch. Is it blood? Yeah, I'm going to smell it and do a little bit of a taste test. Is that what I do? I don't know! I'm not a druid in this life! That's true, right? 15. It's warm. It tastes like bad soup. Oh, we're hiding? Can I climb the tree that I broke off? Oh jeez. Well, it's a one. No, don't! I'm fine! Jesus, don't try to fix it! Just don't try to fix it! He's a bard! What? Hang on, are we rolling initiative? I got distracted, sorry! 22. Oh, it's me up first? Okay. I'm going to turn and I'm going to look at everybody else, and be like, we're fucking up these cats, yeah? Okay! And then I'm going to run forward to the one that's closest to me there. That's it? That's all I got? Okay. And then I'm going to be like, argh! (crying noises) I'm angry, all hormonal rage! I don't have anything I can do, though. I have unarmed strike as a bonus action, but that's all that's on my sheet. Oh, sure. I'm super ready for these cats. Oh yeah! Ow. You are! Damn it! Dick! Fucking hell! My mom warned me about people like you! Jesus, so I've got two kitty cats on me? Three kitty cats? Ugh! What? This is why you spay and neuter your pets! And then I kick the one directly in front of me. Do I get a multiattack as a monk? I get two? Okay, I'm going to kick the first one, just full on punt him, then I'm going to take the stick with the second one and give him a big old golf swing. All right. First one? That's not great. 14 for the first one. One plus three. Four points. Golf swing! Which is-- ooh, that's good, that's 15 plus-- 21. Five, total. I feel guilty. Man, you're so calming, just your presence. So good. In ten years. That's Taliesin! Ashley and I just, football, huh! Huh! And then we do the chest bump thing in the air. Huh! So cute! Yeah, can I assist him on that? 13. Of life, or WB? Can I backtrack, now that we're slowly piecing this together, see if I can find the Hollywood Way sign? The street sign? No, I just want to turn around, if it's right there. He went north? Is he going north on Hollywood Way? I rolled a ten total. Hollywood Way. I didn't see anything! What if this is just a Warner Bros specific thing? What if the rest of LA is okay? But, jungle versus Warner Bros sinking. Is it everything? Look, it's the Valley, there's not a lot of skyscrapers. Turgid, engorged-- She's Ashley. I follow Riegel and I say, why are we running? Yeah, go. Oh, I keep going. Oh god, are we going deeper? No. No. Casting directors. What's happening? Brought to you by the producers of Independence Day! From the producers of 2012! Whoa! Same age? 15. What are these things? It's a really big thing. Is that what that is? (laughs) A chlorinated pool? Okay. Well, I fucking hate the cold above all things! Which is a hundred percent true, so I'm going to fuck this ice-water shit, and start heading out towards the beach, just because that would be my first concern. I say, Yeah! What's up?! This is the party at the end of the world, right? And I just start dancing. Hey! And I cry a little. Oh! Hey! Oh! Do it. You're Ozzy Osbourne and shit? What does that even mean, chew deep? Guys, they hate people who are marketable! That's the key! Be marketable! Wait, you're holding me? What? This is like what I want to have happen when I die. Wear like me a spirit hood! Do it, Ashley, do it! Walk into the ocean. I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm not okay! Rodgers and Hammerstein. Oh, what? I've had this dream. Oh, watch the Tabletop promo, it's real good. We're real proud of it. Yeah, you do! Spell it correctly if you want to win! Demi-gorgon. Demo-gorgon. Chat will get it. So we're all dead? We built Dis post-mortem? Are these sides? Yeah! And I walk up behind and I go, hi. I'm his girlfriend. (nervous laugh) Or super-professional! Look at this velcro suit! Like once. And then the game got canceled, so what's it matter? "We're not gonna have a problem here, are we, Commander?" That was just rehearsal, right? 405 traffic. But the sides were so mediocre! Oh my god, it is. Look! Look, it's the control room! Where's Crafty? God damn, every time, and we have to share it with the other stage. Bullshit. 14. So they can see the crazy. According to us. No one else. Production. You're Ashley motherfucking Johnson. What? Huh? I thought I'd be famous by now. Okay. Wait. What? You're pulling-- okay. I'm gonna look for its power source. Aw, that's not too bad. 14. Is there a cord connected to that? No? Ah, jeez. Okay. I say, I feel like this is a really shitty update. And then I'm gonna try and punch it in its face. Ten for the first one. Second one is real bad. Real bad. That's a four. No, five. No, no, five plus two. Seven. Fuck, this is like a claw machine! Fuck that, it's rigged. (yells) I'm still looking for a mini-USB port. It could be a piece of plywood, it's hard to say. Okay, so I got a 'NO', you got-- 'SAM'. And then he said 'FORGIVE'. 'FORGIVE M--' I got a 'NO', he got a 'SAM', you got a 'FORGIVE M--' What? I look at Matt, and I say, don't kill it? 'Kay. And then I look for its memory card. It's gotta have-- I'm thinking my production elements. Yeah. It's gotta have a memory card somewhere in there. How many gigs does it have? It's hard to say. But if I immediately remove it. Jesus fucking christ, all right. Oh my god, that's a natural 20. See? Look at it. It's a natural 20. Like output? Is it output? And I'm just gonna go click. And see if it pulls out. No? No pulling out of the SD card? It's not connected to the cloud! They don't have a backup drive! I'm just wondering if the memory card-- It does have a backup drive. It does not matter, though. That's the important part, is that no one cares that we have a backup. These people have very poor cloud storage. That's all you need to know. They're not filming in 4K, it's fine, just go. It depends. What did they have on Crafty? Do they have trail mix? You know you better than anyone. Wait, was that (whirring sounds) Neil? Okay. And there's still that thing that's digging in the corner. Can I get to it? Where am I? Wait, what's that thing? Okay, I get to that. And can I take it by the back of its neck and push it and be like, scream real loud! We need the feedback! (yells) And grab it by the back of its neck. And I go, scream! Scream for me! Yeah. Sing! Sing! Sure. Oh, that's not good. Seven. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Damn it, Macs. Okay. There are wasabi peas there, go, go, go! But did he sign his NDA? Oh no. If we don't get a Welch's sponsorship after this, I'm going to pursue that shit. Yo, Welch's. Keep going. Okay, I have this guy? It's just me and him? Okay. And he's a robot, too? Highly expensive camera equipment, repurposed. Okay. Can I sweep his leg and go into a combat triangle and take him down, and then be like, where's your failsafe? Okay. Sweep the leg. Don't fuck me, Gil! That's a natural one, Gil. Can I go There's a firewall! There's a fucking firewall! Do I have another one? I'm going to punch and see if I can grab its cords and rip it out. That's cocked. 18. Yes. (uncertain noises) Okay, where are you? I'm there? There's a crack in the hole? In the ground? There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza. Okay, there's an evil bad guy and then a crack in the ground. It's looking rough? Can I get there in time? Yeah? Okay. I'm going to say, none of this is being saved on the internet, guys! It's fine! And I do a double punch. Okay. 16. And then the second one-- Good. 17. 16 and 17. And that's 1d4 plus three? Three plus three is six, and then one plus three is four. Six and four, ten. (grunts) Fuck you, cloud storage! Fuck you, backup data. You're easily hackable. It's not fair! If only Backblaze was sponsoring us. So inspirational. As we run for the green gap, I say, I saw 'NO' on the screen. What did you see? Are you a rogue? Go behind T! Oh shit. I thought that was an aura of blindness. I'm so sorry. Sequins! Sequins, yeah! You okay, babe? Hey! Hey! Look to the future. Look to the future. Shh. In the future is a campaign guide. And it's good. Towards the campaign guide. Towards it. Okay. We're going. Good. We're good. On Rie. Sam Riegel. Liam, how long have you actually been here? That's right. I definitely wrote that down. (laughs) 8,642. Verbatim. Where's the mini-USB? What? Even if we unplug him, he still dies. Okay. I grab Matt's hand and say, yeah, buddy. It's all good. This isn't real. And I put my hand on the glass, as well, and say, it's all good. Send us back, man. And hand on the glass. Do any of us want it to end, though? This is okay. Only the good die young. That's true. Family? No, the fucking air conditioning broke today, that's all. It's so hot in here. (groans) Pussy pockets! (all shouting over each other) [eerie music] I haven't laughed that hard in so long. Speak and Spell Liam! What was that, like 20 minutes?
