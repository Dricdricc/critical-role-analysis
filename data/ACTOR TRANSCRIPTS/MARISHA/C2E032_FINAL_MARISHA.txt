Sponsor us! Bite-sized segments! Five minutes or less. And on YouTube on Wednesdays. On our Crit Role YouTube. Yeah, next Wednesday. youtube.com/criticalrole, I believe. If anyone owns criticalrole.com, message us back. That's an old joke. (whispers) They're in the rafters! Pigeons everywhere. Yeah, it's nice, right? It's like a little post-coital feeling, kind of.MARISHA,  I have., LAURA, LAURA It's true. I know, so close! Back in Alfield. This is where Bryce lives, right? We should check in with Bryce. Shift pods. Hey, Thadeus. Is Bryce in? Broad Barn? I'm finding a bunch of old dumb jokes. This isn't where we left-- no. This isn't where we left Reginald? No, okay. To be fair, I don't remember him. Sometimes they aren't regular, though-- sometimes they're undead ones. Yeah. But we fought both. What are you doing here? You working here now? Yeah... This might have been the first town we did good. Because we kind of got a guyâ€“ Arrested and thrown in jail for-- Came through in the black, not broken even. Ey! Yeah! Totally know exactly what you're talking about. Soot and dirt, yeah. Wait, when did this happen? Yeah, that's when Dairon decided to go, right? Or was she already out there? Sorry. Yeah. How is the Starosta? Is he still a pain in the ass? What's the best penis you've ever seen? I still want that question answered, but he can go ahead. What's the matter? Even if she hadn't seen them voyeuristically-- Why are you so interested in people's sex lives, Caleb? Yeah, what's your best dick? Oh! Did we scare them away? Oh god. Question. What was the name of the town that Gustav is stuck at? It's the next one. We're in Alfield. That's where I stole mail. Okay, I was getting confused if we were in-- Okay. Cool. Do you guys want to stop in down in Trostenwald on our way? You know, we have a little bit more money now, maybe we could help Gustav out a little bit. The last good thing that we could do. I'm sure he would also like to know about Molly. You know, I never really thought about the fact that when you're with someone when they die, it's kind of your responsibility for forever to tell anyone who doesn't know what happened. That kind of sucks. So let's keep sharing bad news. That's true. No, furthest south I've been, I think, is Trostenwald. Yeah. You could continue your swimming lessons. Sure, let's just do that. What? You're really good! Firstborn. Maybe they're a trail marker. Let's go knock them over. Are we near where the gnoll mine was? Oh, we found a few of those bags. What if it's a trap? Can you do that ritual on the cart as we drive away? Eight? Find another geocache! Come on! Ooh, yeah, maybe that's the guy. We're hiding in the invisible cart. Yeah, why don't we stop by the Nestled Nook? See who's there. Same for me. I flag down Adla. Adelaine? (laughter) Yeah, I was curious if you've seen Gustav around. Tall, thin, elvish-looking man. I thought he was working off his debt. I thought he was-- right? Interesting. All right, thanks. Another round of drinks. Oh, well, I didn't have you around for a little bit, keeping me in check. I tried to do okay, though. I think I did all right. Did I do okay, Caleb? Never mind. What time is it? Sure. No. So generous. Great for cats. Maybe we can wheel and deal with him. Pay a lump sum now and consider it debt repaid, time served. That's right. Hi. (ambiguous noises) Well... You don't know him. Caduceus. What the hell? And where are you getting all of this insight? I'm not arguing prison politics-- I agree with you, I just feel like there's a supernatural situation going on here that you're not necessarily telling us. How much? She wanted to do 1,700? I throw in 165 that's Molly's, but also, hang on. Before we do all this. Listen, Norda, I know we caused a lot of a headache for you when all this was going down. So, we're simply trying to take one more headache off of your list of a lot of headaches. We're trying to do a good thing. A man in jail doesn't do anything for your city, but I bet 1,500 right now would. Don't have to feed him. Think of what you can do for this town with 1,500 gold right now, because let me tell you, we can't give you that 1,700. So we either walk and you're stuck with a prisoner for another nine months, or you take the 1,500. Jazz hands! Hey! Natural 20! Yeah, jazz hands work every fucking time! 17! All right. How much was it? I've got 165 that was Molly's. I can throw in money as well, because that was part of my goal. Okay. Maybe you could find her. We're heading to the Menagerie Coast. You're more than welcome to hop on the wagon, if you want. Can't promise much more beyond that. Do you mean that? Like, if we ever need you, can we hit you up? Yeah but I'm asking because he offered. I don't need you right now. Yeah, okay. Fjord does this mean I'm not the most abrasive person in the group any more? I toss Caduceus a little pouch. That's what's left of Molly's gold, 65. Figured since you put down so much money for a stranger to be busted out, a little bit of reimbursement. Why? Why'd you do it? That's a lot of money for an esoteric reason. 400 gold! Oh! 65 I was gonna toss in way more, but you guys picked up the check. She just was like, "I'm out." Right out the front door. DPB, yes. Ooh. I do my pushups and my pullups. I'm working on it. Beau works out more than I do. Peanut butter. I'll drive for a bit. I haven't taken a shift yet. To the what gate? Geocache! Geocache! Geocache! More hidden treasure! Border patrol. Yeah. Caduceus let's pull off to the side and try to find some cover in the woods. Is there woods to cover behind? It's a gorge? I just don't want to bring a cart with a magical tarp over it, that's designed for smuggling humans. We'll walk outside? Yeah. Yeah. I kind of like having-- Do you think we're okay if we all pile out? That's true. If they reached in to be like, "Oh, are there hidden compartments?", would they see their arm disappear? Or if they're like, "I'm going to climb up and check this out, Frank," and then they're like, "Frank!" Oh shit, maybe she will come to him. What if none of us fully understood that? I know. You're like the one happy person at the DMV. Caduceus MVP tonight. Yeah. What? Just a little chamomile. It's calming. A little lavender. Holy shit. General intelligence? Oh my god. Oh goodness! Ettins? Oh my god. Just keep this going. Awesome. Fucking awesome. We used it. Kind of. There's a rock slide, you guys. One minute. No, if a creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have a direct line of sight on you-- I'll go ahead and hop out and try and give the horses less weight to pull, and run alongside. 23. Caduceus, then Caleb? Are the horses still going to move on Caduceus' turn? Oh. Okay. Fuck. What do I do? Well, I can get to one of them for sure. I can get to that one, but can I get to that one over there? 45 feet. 45. Okay, so we are moving. I'm going to go right in the middle in between them, behind the cart. No, back. Yeah. Back a little more, towards you. Yeah. Then I'm going to take the dodge action. I'm going to take the dodge action. Can I hold my attack if I take the dodge action? Patient Defense? Can I do that? I do that. I'm going to hold my action as soon as one of them is close enough to hit. Correct. It's okay. You guys go. Keep going, keep going. Where's big Beau? If anyone in production wants to look for big Beau minis? God damn it. You're amazing! I knew that production would find it! Max is the best. (cheering) Mighty Nein, roll out! I can attack as soon as he comes up to me? Well, that's balls. Ten. It was an 11. You need to work out. Yeah, Summer Dance! Summer Dance now! Okay, I'm going to take-- Grab my hands behind this guy's head, and just give him a full knee-- right thigh/knee, head right into the knee. 17. Okay, I'm going to do Stunning Strike. Eight damage. Yeah. I am now going to-- Oh, that's right. Thanks, Caleb. Extra one point. I am now going to attempt to, with that knee, give a full front kick and try and knock him prone. Yeah, because I have advantage on athletics checks. Okay, 17 again. No wait, sorry. 16, but that's okay. I'm going to turn and I'm going to run, full sprint, towards that guy. My 45 speed. Bonus action, Flurry of Blows. Flurry of Blows. Big Beau, big Beau. Okay, first attack. Natural 18. Second attack, I'm just going to do both of them. Natural one. So I'll take that natural 18, which is three plus another three, six plus four, so nine damage. MATT and Ten damage. It's okay. We're so baked. With a Flurry of Blows, can I also try and make that a Stunning Strike? Can I double down? Yeah, I'm going to try and stun them with that first one. Can I do that, or is it too far beyond? I'm okay, if it's too late. What, you're going to throw it at him? I get my Sentinel attack, right? It hits. It's a natural 15. Two plus four, plus my extra four. That's six plus three is nine. Fuck, okay. So it would have evened out. So I'm going to buy an extra reaction, for Sentinel. Keep this motherfucker from going. 15. No, 16. No, he does not. Nine damage, and he doesn't get to move. As he's trying to run away, and since I'm big Beau, and I can do this, I just go Oh, nope, no! And I stick my leg out, and trip him. Yeah, that's it. I just want to Three Stooges trip him. That was real convenient, guys. Did you see that? (deep voice) That was deeper than for real. It's still stunned, yeah. Kill him. Kill him! You're holding your action until-- Within 30 feet-- I'm probably more than 45 feet away. I'd have to run up and-- I'm just going to, from here, take out one of my throwing darts and throw that. 30 feet-- oh, I'm not within 30 feet, am I? I don't know. Darts-- It's like 25 without-- it's fine. I'm just going to-- With disadvantage? No, I'm going to wait for Nott for that Guiding Bolt with advantage. I'm going to run towards the cart. (deep voice) It's just me, guys. Does that have advantage? Yeah, so he gets to shake it off. Kill him. Caleb, naked, riding the Fireball. It's still alive? Beau goes over to Caleb-- I pick Caleb up, and throw him over my shoulder. Nott, do you want to get on the other shoulder? Okay. Ugh! I'm fine! I was just going to pick up Nott! (shakily) It's all good. (straining) Ugh. Can I set you down now? I'm going to set you down now. Maybe it's a petting zoo. Is he stopped, or is he moving? Good day! Mm-hmm. Morning! I go over as well. (whispering) Jester, look! Twin cubs! They're so cute on you! This is his way of saying she sucks. That's like nothing, really. I mean, yeah. Oh my god, he's got more! Can I trade you these two birds for that owl? Can I hold the owl? I know! Will the owl eat the weasels? Well, can we teach them to be friends? I kind of like a challenge. Ferret smell. Is the owl the natural predator of blink dogs? Or would the owl-- Will the dog eat the owl? How much for the dog and the owl? Yeah, it's a bird of prey that you have to wear a glove to handle. How awesome is that? I don't know. You're going to get the weasel too, okay. Here's my question what do we do with all these animals? (laughter) But then what? I don't, either. We could get them and just figure it out as we go. Just watch it die. Is the owl on me? I have the owl? Do I have the glove on? Do I have the dope glove? He didn't give me the glove? I just have him? But I've got my wraps. I have awesome bracers. Does it look cool on my bracers? Yeah, right? Yeah? Can I pet? Oh god, he's going to eat myâ€” 16. Scritches, yeah, scritches. Oh, we're so much alike. Yeah, I can train him to fly and come back to me, and be cool. I know, Fjord! Get out of my head. (laughter) I want the owl! And we're going to split the cost of the dog. Okay. This is so many-- (laughter) What's the name of my dope owl? What's he called? But what's his breed? What's his color? Oh no. What do we name him? I'm not against it. Yeah. Nugget. I'll think about it. Yeah, what do I feed it? Can we get a carrying crate? Mice, yeah. Cool. And it's gone. I know, why did we do this?! Yeah, it totally was! (laughter) No apartment is letting us in now, ever. Cannot get approved. Why did we do that? I don't know why we did that. Now we've got to think of a name! It's pretty amazing. Eat the weasel! Wednesday. You always say yes to putting your dick in-- There's the PB&J cart, it works fine. You eat like a fourth of a cup of playa dust at the end of that week. At least.
