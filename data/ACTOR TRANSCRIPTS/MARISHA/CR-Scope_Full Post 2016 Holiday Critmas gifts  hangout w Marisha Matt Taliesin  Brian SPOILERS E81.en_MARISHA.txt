Hi guys! I'm realizing I look like a fisherman right now. That's some high school shit right there. What watch? Oh shit. Boris is a spider. Mmm. It's chilly. Should I turn the heat up? I'll turn the heat up just a tidbit. I love how we're sitting in front of the Christmas tree, but it's not plugged in. It's like a compromise. Let's see. This is from, wait, this is to Brian Foster. Should I open it for him, though? Well, it's Brian Foster, care of Critical Role. Currently it is in the care of Critical Role. He'll understand. Won't you, Brian? He might be watching. He watches our shit. I'm going to get mine done later. I'm so stoked! I'm going to go back to purple, back to purple. What is happening? There's lots of packing peanuts. I've got a good confirmation on packing peanuts. Oh! They're whiskey glasses. They're shot glasses, I think. Oh nice. Oh my god! Foster! (glass shattering) It's an extra Critical Role one. Oh my goodness. Okay. I've got to go grab my phone and take a picture. This is from Eddie Chandler, @chandlereddie1. And he says, "Hello, Brian. I "felt you needed one of the Critical Role Glasses. However, please also find one especially for you "and your show. Call it a late birthday/X-mas gift, etc." Oh! That's where it's at. Oh my god. I might have to make some hot chocolate right now. Fuck me. Chocolate Freddo the Frog, a caramel koala. What's a Buzz? Milk chocolate-covered marshmallow and caramel. Fuck yeah, man. Chocolate everywhere else is better than in the United States. We have terrible chocolate because our FDA standards suck. Holy shit. I have to go to take a picture and send this to Foster. It's fine. I have to do this now, or else I'll forget. You'll eventually stop. Oh. Oh. I like the box. Dagon just took a bath. She's a wet bird. Hi, Tuk! Fuck that. Right? Plus it's a magical fantasy land. I'm pretty sure they have contraceptives. MATT and Oh, this is from Tuk. Yeah, Tuk! We got your box! I don't know why I'm screaming it at you. "Congratulations on "your engagement! The box contains a small present I think you will both appreciate. Wishing you a "Merry Aussie Christmas. Love, Tuk." Oh look at it. It's an ostrich, a koala, a kangaroo, having a beach Christmas. Okay, what's in here? (laughs) I think she got us thyme. There's never enough thyme. It's a box of thyme. Aw, then she said, "Just kidding. This is your real gift." Oh, this is amazing. She made a donation in honor of our engagement. Tuk, this is amazing. She gifted solar lights and school pencils through the World Vision Association in Australia. "A gift of pencils means kids in poor communities can write, draw, and dream their way "to a brighter future. A gift of solar lights is a clean and safe energy solution for families made "homeless by conflict or disaster." This is amazing. Thank you so much, and as well as your gift of thyme, of all the time. That's amazing. I especially appreciate this watch that says, "I believe in you!" This box smells like thyme. Box me. Brian might come by. He's in Van Nuys, I guess. How does this box work? How do box work? This is also from somewhere over the pond. Candy! What is it? What is it? Is it Shiraz? I hope it's Shiraz. This is for Liam. This is Wispa. This has got to be from-- This is for Matt. You get a thing. Who is this from? Someone got us lots of candy. This is from Rebecca aka Vehlr. You know this already. "You probably already know this, but "you guys are awesome. I came to the show quite late. You guys were already beyond your 50th show "when the Critical Role wave hit me, so I got to watch a lot of the unfolding." She goes on to talk about how-- I know. I want to make sure I'm not doing. Her workmates got into the show and now they want to start their own game. She said Liam's one shot was very innovative for her. "As I write this, you are no doubt preparing for episode 72. The fans are wildly "theorizing, the artists are producing amazing things for Inktober, and Taliesin is keeping it "spooky on Twitter." "Despite all my years of trolling the internet, thanks to you I have been surprised by "how good a fandom can be." She doesn't say-- oh! Rebecca's the one that got the tattoo. Because she said her wrist is healing up. "Turns out, my tattoo is in exactly the wrong place for typing." Oh shit. I don't know where these came from. Thank you, Rebecca. That's amazing, we'll make sure that Liam gets this, and then that's for you. Nope. I got you, man. I love the seal. Fuck yeah, wax seal. Yeah. Periscope pants. Comfort pants. I have to wear real pants far too often. Oh my god, crazy handwritten letters. Kat! Kat! This is from Kat! It has to be Shiraz. "Dear Matt and Marisha, "Firstly, thank you. I know you must hear it all the time, but you are both such amazing, "inspirational people. I was lucky enough to meet you both in person. It just made me admire and "respect you more. Critical Role has been a great source of inspiration for me, and like many other "Critters and Critical Role artists, this got me back in a steady creative headspace each week. "There is always something new and inspiring to create and form." She goes on to talk about her artistic drive "Watching Critical Role--" Once again, I don't want to say anything that is too personal. "Anyway, I'm sure by now you know how awesome you both are. No need me for me to keep "reminding you. I wanted to share some wine with the wine speaker and vendor herself. Please enjoy "the Ashari brew from the Fire Plane of Australia. Much love, Kat." What the fuck! What?! You see that?! Which is sexy sounding. That sounds like something we would try to get Patrick Rothfuss-- hey, Patrick Rothfuss. Ashari Shiraz. Ashari Shiraz. Ashari Shiraz. That wasn't too bad Irish wristwatch. Wow, this is insane. It's all the way down. I don't even-- wow. "Local knowledge of the "volcanic earth has helped us to select the prime goodberries of the Shiraz variety. Across the vast "Fire Plane valleys of Australia, this vineyard, diversely coupled with traditional druidic wine "bending techniques, result in a pure druidic Shiraz. The Ashari people have been immersed in "the culture of farming, food, wine, and community for hundreds of generations. Our commitment to the "quality in all aspects is unwavering, and any wine that bears the Ashari druid symbol represents the "purest of excellence in wine and community. Produced by the wine druids of the Ashari people. "Wine of the Ashari contains sulfur." I feel like I should open it. Jesus shit. This is amazing! Kat, you're ridiculous. That's a very positive inducing gift. I'll try and move faster. Same. This is from Anna Krezowski. From Maine? (grunting) Don't say that like it's probably going to happen. This is not a gift. Well, we used to. That's true. Ooh, what is these? Meghan LeVaughn. Meghan got me a Pac-Man dress. Isn't that so cute? I actually have Pac-Man leggings that these will totally go with. Yeah! That's pretty adorable. Oh, Meghan! You spoil us too much. So cute, thank you! Shut up! Where should we put that? We were wanting more rugs for the office. We could also use that on the Talks Machina set. Oh my goodness gracious. That's so awesome! Dude, that's nuts. You guys! Do you want me to take over, Matt? Hi, everybody. How you doing? That is what I want in my life. Yes, because I am the alchemist of the group. That I really need to get back to focusing on. We haven't really had time, let's be honest. Oh my goodness! Those are amazing! Which was amazing, and we've both been wearing those fingerless gloves like crazy. That's right! She mentioned this online. No, when we saw her. Well, we're not going to sell them. That's not a thing you do. Well, I feel like I need a pair because of Raishan, because I am going to be wearing that bitch very soon. Put them on! Hey Matt would you do me a favor? Would you scooch a foot closer to Taliesin. No, that's better. It's better. It's good. (laughs) Yes! I feel like those are going to Burning Man with us. People said you guys look like wrestlers. Inside mine is a green six sided die. Oh wow. Those are really nice! Oh shit! Beazibub? I really want some candy. I haven't eaten any candy yet. I want to eat candy. That's a very pink-- It's so pink! It matches your hair! Nice! What is it? Open it! I want to know what's in the fluorescent pink package! Oh, Matt, turn around the mug. Turn around the mug. Did you see? It has an insignia on it. Did you see the insignia on it? Sorry, I was distracted by the fluorescent pink. What is it? They're vials of color. Why are there vials of color? Wait, what's the ink for? Really? That's awesome. Would that work with that glass pen? Oh, he sent more? Pile of candy! Just tempting me! That arrived. That's in the kitchen right now. We were told we couldn't open it until we'd killed all the dragons, so as soon as diseased bitchy-bitch is-- --dead, then we can, you know. Sick! Just like that? Hells yes. It came from the other side of the world! Oh! Australian candy and Japanese candy? Oh, man, it's the best! What are they? Cyber? I don't know, man! Brian Foster, everybody. BRIAN and They're all saying, "Brian, yes!" Oh really? Did they hang up our poster? Yeah, it used to be a big kid toy store. Right? Yeah, look, man. Yeah, we all know that. You do have a cult. What?! Fashion candies? Oh, she gave me my own? Yes! Oh! Aw, you can't go wrong with "Chocolate and a Puppy." Oxfam! Yeah! Oxfam! Sure. I know. Is it something in the air or is it just because? Dagon's talking a lot now if people want to see her, so I'm going to bring in Dagon. Matt? Come look where Dagon is. I don't know! Wait, did you know she was here? How did you get there, you little shit. There she is. Dagon, you bad bird. There you go. Yeah, a great place for a bird. She was on the glass in the fireplace in there. I don't even know how she got there, little shit. She is, actually. Will you hand me something else? Oh, this is from Matt Gostick. He's one of our OG Critters. I've always wanted someone to sing Paradise by the Dashboard Light with me at karaoke, but I could never find anybody. Really, are you serious? Oh my god, this is amazing, Foster. I know, man. Speaking of, he got us cocktail thematic teas. Pineapple mimosa, raspberry mojito, and sangria. They're tea, but it's-- Yeah. There like fizzy cider candies. Reese's Pieces. The sun is setting. We could always just turn the lights on. The Pot of Gold is for Laura. I know. TALIESIN and The Reese's Pieces are for Travis. "I saw you devour the first batch, so here's another." This is from Gostick, which he said, "a.k.a. the inferior Matt." Not true, Matt Gostick, you are not-- There are no-- Don't fall over with a box cutter and a bird. And the tea is for us. We need to plan it. Where is the other-- Ooh. Meghan already sent a present. Meghan, you're so silly. Liam Oberon's a cool name. This is from Colin from Blueford, Pennsylvania. Aw, he sent little knitted dragons for each one of the Chroma Conclave. Look at this! Oh my goodness! Kill it. Yeah, kill it. Kill that dragon. Oh, here's-- These are cute as shit. Those are so cute. Colin from Pennsylvania. "To the cast of Critical Role enclosed in this box are four of the most dangerous "creatures in all of Exandria, shrunk down into plushie cute forms, of course! However, two have "been vanquished, and just like getting the scales and teeth as trophies, these guys get to go home "with the appropriate dragon-killer of Vox Machina. Which means Travis gets Umbrasyl, Laura gets "Vorugal--" Oh, this is cute, "Travis gets Umbrasyl the Yarn Devourer, Laura gets Vorugal the Knitted "Doom, whoever gets the killing blow on the corresponding dragon gets the plushie counterpart." "There is still Thordak the Crocheted King," which goes to Raishan, which we now know. Or to-- MATT and "And Raishan the Darned Deceiver." That's so cute. Which we don't know yet. Where'd the other box cutter go? But there's two! Aw. I'm someone's spirit animal. That's amazing! It's okay. You don't have to make excuses. We're not angry. These are awesome! Oh, these are so cute. I haven't had a friendship bracelet in so long. I'm going to have to get this on. I love friendship bracelets. I like seeing how long they last. How long can I wear this in the shower, exactly. Yeah, tilapia. This is from Shay. "I can't begin to express to you all how much enjoyment I have "received from the hundreds of hours of this show. I wanted to show my gratitude in the crafty way I "could, so please enjoy. P.S. ones for the crew are forthcoming." So she is sending more. I'm sure one for you, as well. Here, Matt. Oh jeez! Who is Jack Hanna? Oh. You will support black bears. Thank you! These are amazing. Keyleth's circlet. What's yours? Your glasses with Orthax. TALIESIN and Oh my goodness. Oh, are you on a rampage? You on a little birdy rampage? Go to daddy. She wants Dad. Pew pew! Pew pew! Pew pew! Pew pew! Aww! Is this someone else? Yeah, Nuri. Oh wow. Donated to rescue.org. "I tried to do a Critical Role themed donations gift, but instead "I'd like to thank you for being a badass chick on the internet by donating to help a refugee mother "give birth in safety and a $50 donation to the Nature Conservancy," on top of that which is incredible! Keep kicking ass in 2017. Love, Nuri. Thank you so much! Oh my goodness. That's so generous! It's 2017, who knows. All bets are off. Where's the box cutter? I want my friend, Mr. Box Cutter. Uh-oh. I will utilize that in a couple hours. Oh, thank you. Meghan LeVaughn sent more journals for us. Good things are happening journals. Yeah. So whoever would like a journal, those are from Meghan. Because Meghan is sweet and enjoys spoiling us so much. Thank you so much, Amanda, for the letter. It was amazing also meeting you at Gen Con, and she said she was looking forward to your Halloween episodes of Signal Boost, Taliesin. I'm assuming she has watched them-- Yes, but thank you so much, Amanda. Aww! Thank you, Meghan. I'm going to go get another box. Yep, shooting tomorrow. Brian's going to come host an episode. I mean, I think you're technically doing it right now, yeah. It's going to be like-- When it finally happens, when KISS finally went on air without their makeup on. That's what it's going to be like. Holy shit, wow, man. Oh yeah, pindragon has sent stuff before, right? Shut. Up. This is from Dana. "I love watching the show, but I have a lot "of trouble sitting still, I always need to be multitasking. So since I was in a sewing rut at "the time, I made these guys for all of you. It kept my fingers busy, and it got me through "Episodes 25 through 58 in the span of two to three weeks. I know watching through the last few "Critmases some of you have gotten similar items, but I figure you can never have too many soft "things to hug when the road to saving the road gets scary. Sending these to celebrate finally "getting caught up to the show and finally being available to watch the livestreams every Thursday. "Hope you like them. Dana. Attached is a plaiting guide because I thought it was cute." Hope you guys are ready for this. Matt? Travis, Ashley-- Do you want to open Ashley's? Yeah? Liam, Taliesin-- Wait, open it first. Oh my god! I want to see yours, let me see yours! Oh my god. Yours comes with the little mask? Shut up. And yours comes with the little hood! Yours comes with masks? These are adorable. Those masks are legit, oh my god. Hand-sewn-- Dana? Dana! Which box? Is that this box? What now? And some Buffalo wing sauce. Holy shit! (British accent) Oh, is that for your little redhead? (shouting) Sponge candy! What? Yeah, we had some in there. It was so good. I just got some the other day. Yeah, we opened her card. Oh god! I almost stepped on a box. Going to have to find a frame for that. Are those also on canvases? That's Zahra with an "h." Those are sick. Lacey! Yeah. Huh? Shwinky Dinks. Heck yeah. Yeah, that is. That is super smart. This looks like it's for you, Matt. Aw, yeah! Oh my gosh! These are so cute! It's also such a good idea to use Shrinky Dinks. Aw, love you too, Dan! So cute! It's my second season outfit, too! I can't wait for my third season outfit. "Oh my god!" I'm pretty stoked about my hair change, not going to lie. Oh my gosh! Oh, dude, Tal. (gasp) Is that-- What is it? Is it a little Clarota? It's the patience thing. That's right. Yeah, Ashley edited together our first sizzle. Yep. It was awesome. She whipped it out in a day, too. I know, she's our bae. That's true. Okay, this is from Jared Hayes. Back to her cage. Right? I took her back, right? Yeah, she's in her cage. I questioned it for a second. "To my favorite group of nerdy-ass "voice actors As a token of my appreciation for the hundreds of hours of entertainment Critical "Role has given me, I wanted to make something cool for each of you out chainmail to aid you in your "quest. Dice bags are usually the go-to, but in my opinion, mail dice bags look like used metal condoms--" "So instead, I decided to skip the bag part and straight up make you some chainmail dice. "The colors for each dice were chosen specifically with your characters in mind. The rings are "atomized aluminum and the filling is 99.9% hypoallergenic polyester. These dice were not fair "and not in a helpful, don't-let-Matt-know kind of way, either." Nothing. "Even if you can't use them in game, I hope you enjoy these dice as much as I "have enjoyed Critical Role. All the best, Jared Hayes @jrphayes. P.S., I'm glad people have "started putting this in their letters so that we know when they sent them-- The Thordak fight is "next week. Try not to die. P.S.S., the butter cookie Kit Kats can be baked in the toaster oven "for two to two and a half minutes." Japanese Kit Kat! Can you do it again? Two for two? Look, that was not on me! You guys. Look at these! This is Pike's die. This one's Scanlan's. These are so cool! These are Percy's! Here's the DM's. Sorry, I did not mean to do that. I didn't. This is Vex. Here's Travis's. This is mine. Oh, it's Air Ashari colors! Marishatt for life. That's a 3D-printed card? Oh my god, it's the inside of Whitestone! Wait, what are these? Are those stanzas? Hell, yeah! Isn't that crazy? What is this? Oh, is this from her? Tristan! Yeah! They bought us dice bags? These are sick. What was the brand of that? I know, I'm drawing a blank-- Helvetica! Right? That's a font. Thank you, Tristan! Wait, doesn't that happen on a two or a one though for Animus? That's amazing. Merceray! Is Ryan Green in chat? Ryan Green. It does go fast. It's an audio version of the Christmas Carol. By Craig Tyhurst. That is so awesome! That's such a good idea! Yeah, we opened those. We got you, girl. But we try. We've watched it a few times. Maybe. It's been shoulder-length a long time ago, and that was the shortest it's ever been. I've never done a bob, I've never been Keyleth short, like chin-length. I've never gone chin-length before. (in a British accent) There's been a lot going on over there at good old Geek & Sundry. In Halifax. Oh shit, like TSR books? This is from Lindsey M. from Polk City, Florida. (in a Southern accent) Polk City, Florida. To Vox Machina, it says, "Congrats to Matt and Marisha," on the back. This looks pretty amazing. "Dear Vox Machina, enclosed is a token of my eternal appreciation and the shenanigans that "you bring to the Critters each Thursday. Knitting is a hobby of mine, and I teach my English "students how to make hats and scarves for the homeless during an after school community program "called 'The Neckwits.'" That's awesome! "A few of my students watch the show and one, at 16, is a DM "herself. They were stoked when I told them that I was crafting gifts for all of you wonderful "people. I hope you like them, I've already given Will Friedle his at a local con. Thank you again "to your talent, your humor, and your inspiration. Merry Critmas! #performancematters, #percahlia, #iwouldliketoknit, #ravenclawforlife." Lindsey from Winter Haven, Florida, and she knit us Dungeon Master Mercer. Scanlan, which has musical notes on it. Holy shit. Vex'ahlia, which has the bear paw prints. These are crazy, you guys. Vax'ildan, which's got "Dagger, dagger, dagger." Keyleth of the Air Ashari, that's so funny. She put my whole title on there. I'm putting this on right now. There's Travis's Grog. Oh, Adam! Thank you, Tiamat. Thank you. I watched the Batman animated series quite a lot. I also watched some X-Men back in the day, the original X-Men cartoon. Is it a coin? This one here? It's heavy. MATT and It's-- It's glass-- ooh, they look like mugs! Here. It's not a cartoon, but I was pretty obsessed with Wishbone. Does anyone remember Wishbone? You weren't paying attention to my Wishbone story. You know, that was very convoluted as a kid. No, you don't understand, Mom, why can't I go hang out with Chip and Dale? Oh, shit. Oh my god! Oh shit! It's got a Minxie paw! Hell yeah. Do they just get a pint? That's the problem, we all work at least two or three full-time jobs. Do it, do it! Oh, boxes! Oh, that's awesome! She made this necklace that-- Yeah, it really does. She made this necklace inspired by "Make Them Gold" from my playlist. Yeah! That is so rad. This is so pretty! Aw, thank you. Thank you for your letter, Emily. This box is so pretty. Yeah. Did you get it? It's like an archaeologist's dig. Talking to your make-believe friends? Holy shit. Wow. This might be the best-- What are we going to do with these things? You want to put them on the Talks Machina-- oh, but-- I don't know, the new staff, maybe? Look at the gems, the crystals coming out of his horns. Wow, that's stupid. What kind of batteries? MATT and Yeah. Where are the other ones? Oh, we put them in your office, that's right. What happens if we don't kill Raishan? Let's put on more music. Man, this looks like a Critmas hurricane went off in my front living room. You've got to transport them like it's a wedding cake. Oh, fuck yeah! Give it. Are you going through the settings? There we go. Uh, that's sick. That's banging. Yeah, it kind of is. Oh yeah! What is it? Oh shit! Oh my god! You guys. Oh my god! It's Kit and Wendy-- it's a few different people's arts. It's leather that they've etched. Right? This is from our Winter's Crest festival comic that Taliesin and I wrote when we did our little comic. Look at that. Wow. That's even more-- and it was the art contest winner, that's even more amazing. We might have to do some set redecorating. I forgot, he sent wallets for the guys. RecklessRobbie. Wow. We got really close. I think we're going to be getting an upgrade soon. It's like a shield. (shouting) This is Vox Machina! That's true. Motherfuck, that's awesome. Wow. All right, so-- Maybe it's-- That would be amazing. Wow, that's really big. This is to us? Oh. Jesus. Oh, Jason! Whoa. That scared the shit out of me. There're several layers. This is amazing. Aw, thank you! Thanks for sending it for our wedding, especially since we didn't get one of those. We didn't get one. So that's awesome. The big Joe Mad one. That might also be a great Talks Machina-- or, yeah. Oh, god damn it, Glenn. Fucking Glenn. A few letters. We got letters from-- From John Cox, Seth Taylor, Lee Teetsle. I heard that. Gil M. Saint-Germain, Jenny Huntofts. From Erlanger, Kentucky. My neck of the woods. BRIAN and We got letters from you so you know we will look at those. We also-- what is this? Time-sensitive, please get to Matt Mercer as soon as possible. Aw, they're fwiends! Would any of it have been helpful? All right, guys. I think that's it. Right? I need a break and some tea. Maybe a glass of wine. We did it! I know, and all the charity gifts are always amazing. Thank you so much for all the congratulations and all the kind words and all the-- The sugar. I really hope I kill Raishan so I get to keep that little green dragon. We'll see you on Tuesday for Talks Machina. Wow, every time. Every time.
