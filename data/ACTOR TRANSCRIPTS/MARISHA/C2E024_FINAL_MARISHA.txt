Please tell me this is true. Anthony Kiedis! That's who that picture looked like! I had to remember his name. Show it again! It's Anthony Kiedis! I'm just saying! Look look look! Shit. She's going to die. It is called the Blushing Tankard. Why is it blushing? Do I see anyone selling glow sticks? Light up swords. I want a fiber optic whip. That's not great. Nine. Just keep it going, I'm just going to-- and I just roll off. Okay, I go up to the sparklers and firecrackers. I want three of everything. How much comes in a pack? They come in packs? Ten? Ten sparklers or ten poppers? Yeah, I want one of each. Pack of each. Okay, thank you. Then I also get a flower necklace for Jester. I'll, ah-- Do you also do braids? I'll just take one. I catch up, and I give Jester the flower necklace. (grunting) It looked like you. I'm sorry if it smells weird. I take out one of the poppers, and I throw it! On the ground, what happens? Shit! I jump out, and I go pick it up, it's too valuable. I run back. Oh, there's a process, okay. I jump back on. Caleb, light it! Okay! Oh, like skeet shooting! Okay! (whoosh) You see that? I'm their hero. This is amazing, these could be useful. For distractions. We could do that again and like when we're fighting people-- Yeah. How many is in a pack? I might have to get more before we leave this town. Try to get some rooms. Molly and I will go. Who do we talk to? Do we talk to the gnome or the dwarf? Yeah, we should do the bar lean in thing. Shove some other people around, do that thing. Something we're great at. Just straight checks? It rocks back and forth. Okay. Eight. That seems oddly backwards. We need a couple of rooms, a few rooms, a handful of rooms. And some drinks. How many rooms do we need? Three, four? Does it come with amenities? Does it have a mini bar? Do you charge? All right. Sorry to interrupt your incessant flirting. Can I please have a damn drink?! Yes, one of the same, yes! I thought he paid for me; I thought you paid for me. I just kill the whole thing. It's kind of medicinal. I thought so, too. That sounds cute. I really like it when she crosses her arms like that, it makes her biceps look good. You know, I've never seen anyone actually swing from a chandelier. I just thought it was a metaphor. I bring over a round of drinks for everybody. I somehow feel like that's worse. What? I see if I catch one. Missile Snare. I'm going to try to catch one of Molly's coins. Natural one. It is. I wink back. You know, I kind of liked that. It was kind of hot. Let's go. Who's going to put Kiri either on their shoulders, or we need to-- What if we get her one of those child leashes? She does seem very uncomfortable, yeah. Blade pointed down, Kiri. Good job. There we go. There's too many dance puns! Yeah? No, I know, I'm your second choice-- Feels like you had to reach for that. You stammered a little. I do have a lot of scarves. Did you just put a hooker on layaway? I will say, normally being like, "You slept with my mom" is an insult or something, or "Don't talk about my mom." Sorry, you jumped conversations. You have to specify. You want to buy them out real fast? Let's go! We can just pay for it. We go pick up some more snappers and poppers, poppers and snappers. Nott, the flower guy's creepy. Just felt like throwing that out there before we approach. I go up to the snapper and popper guys. Need more packs. Plus all the packs. Where do you find more powerful? Hey, Nott, do you want to-- just stand by me. Hey, don't-- why are your eyes wandering at her? What was that? No, give me your packs! Oh, you piece of shit. Hey, don't ever apologize for who you are, man. You can't help that shit, first off. You can't predict when people are going to be shitty. That's pretty-- that's a good point. When? Yeah, he's a good guy. And you think you do? That's true. Hupperdook? The job that I had before I met up with you guys, in Zadash, information passes through. You hear things. I worked at a library, the Cobalt Soul library. It is a faction of monks. No, I hope not. I think it differs from day to day, depending on what I'm doing. Do you think I'm a bad guy? That's all that matters, right? That has to do with the job that I had before the job that I had. Yeah. Yeah, there's definitely something missing, right? Let's catch up with the others while we walk and talk. My dad was super protective and I was an asshole and rebelled a lot. Yeah. You know, so when interesting and different people would pass through my hometown I started making some connections, started getting involved in some mainly illegal trading. I got in really big trouble from my parents because I started syphoning his cases of wine and selling them underground for half the cost, without tariffs. Yes, I was. Yeah. On top of other things, that was like my big denouement, you know? I don't know, I just grew to hate the town that I was in and the system that my father was a part of and so everything-- He wasn't a bad person. I think he just had bad direction. I don't know, he could've been a good dad. He was a shitty dad and a good businessman. Yeah. Yeah, kind of. One day, he found out about what I was doing after I'd already gotten in trouble for, you know, a little bit of mild extortion, and a little bit of trading, little bit of trafficking. So I think he was already pretty irritated with me. Then he found out about my smuggling scheme with his wine. One day, he called me down into the living room and there was a whole group of monks and people in black. I tried to fight them off and they grabbed me and they drug me away. My dad paid to get me abducted by monks, yeah. He wasn't very proud. Sure. Great. Yeah. I mean, there were elements that were hard, but everyone has had hardships, right? What's it matter? Besides, he sent me off to the monks. I think he was hoping that they were going to beat my indiscretions out of me. Instead, I think all of the things that my father saw in me that he hated, the monks saw as a potential advantage. So, in a weird way, I think it might've been the nicest thing he ever did for me. I mean, I still never really want to see him again, and I don't think he wants to see me again, either. In fact, he told that he didn't want to see me again. So it's good. Yeah. But, I do have a nice little wineskin that I keep reserved, of my family's wine, if you want to taste. I toss Nott the wine. Anybody else wants a sip of my heritage? Scones are hard to make. Happy Father's Day. You guys know that dancing is about spontaneity and you are planning this dance, like when this is going to happen, so hard. Let your heart go. Sure. I like dancing to dance. Do you guys still have one of those wands? Here. I take off my belt ribbon and I tie it around your Wand of Smiles. Now you have a ribbon dancer of smiles. It recharges, right? Over time? 16! 25 and five silver! I'm pretty good at it, too. I can also give you some magic mushrooms if you want to slip them in their drinks. So you have to drink fast? I thought you just said it didn't matter how fast-- Copy. Come on, Molly. Yes! My resting bitch face is stronger! And I jump in. Yes, girl, yes! Fjord, she has crazy eye. Do I have advantage because people are chanting my name? Don't fuck me, Gil. 16. Yeah, I am! Blue die. Okay! 21. I'm not as tough as Beau. Fuck. Seven. Don't fuck me, Gil. I'm going to let it go, I'm going to let it live, 19. No, 20! No, 17, 18, 19! I know math. Plus three. I wipe the sweat off with my robe. Nine. All right, Gil. Comes down to you, boy. Did she already roll? (frustrated noise) Six. No, five. Sorry! Ugh. Okay. High metabolism. Use it! Yeah Tanya! Woo! I like Tanya! Nott, she said you were bad! Fucking champ! Fuck his shit up, Nott! Fuck his shit up! Oh shit! Bottomless pit! Yeah, BP! (chanting) Break the tank! Break the tank! (drunkenly) And we get our names on the board! (drunkenly) Yeah. My mouth is watering. She wants to fuck your brains out. He's too drunk to fuck. He's a little embarrassed. His penis gets a little limp after a few drinks. It's nothing personal. Do you have a topical cream? Nevermind, that's a different problem. It's his penis problem again. What?! That's very observant. Can you feel this? Slap! Did you feel that? My hands are stinging now. I think I'm going to puke. Give me five minutes. I'm going to go out. I'm going to go behind the alley. I'm going to barf. I'm going to clean myself up, and then I'm going to go back in a little bit more put together. Yep! I'm coming in the door. Let's keep going! What? I will fucking punch you if you try and kiss me. I know I'm attractive. Normally, I'll wake up and I sweat it out. What? I'm a hot mess and I like it! Saving throw? God, this one does this every time. It's kind of a dick. Six. No! No, that was a party foul! Was that inside of me? Did you touch inside me? Oh, fuck. All right, now what? Motherfucker. Who did it? Jester! My coi-- fuck. Fuck, I'm still hungover! Goddamn it! My coin purse is missing! My koi pond! Motherfucker, there was 300 gold in there! Someone's going to fucking die. Yeah, I think that's exactly what happened. We're going to go talk to Irene right now. I bet she knows the motherfucker. We're going to fucking track him down. Whatever that bitch's name is. Let's go! I lied; I had way more in there than that. We just got fucking-- (exhales deeply) All two gold? All right guys, here's the deal-- LAURA and No, fuck! I'm so angry! Fuck! Yeah, we put our winnings-- we split it up and threw it in the pack. I also don't think this was necessarily a one-person job. Normally there's a couple people doing stuff like that, or one person is a runner, and one person is a looker. Do you remember what my bag looked like? It matches my sash that you still have on your wand. I almost forgot we tied that on! That was funny. Man, we were drunk. Sorry. We were super drunk. Nott, did you have any of those trinkets, like my jade bracelet, in your bag? Fuck! Let's see if we can get some tips, and that's something later. That's not a bad idea. With what fucking money, Molly? Yeah, in a few ways. Do you know anyone where that's their little side hobby? Is she lying to me? Does she know more? 12. Is there a thieves' guild? Is this a goblin thing? What was your question? Wow, that was a layer of questions. What is it, charisma saving throw? 16. I like you a lot. Here's the deal. (laughter) They do have our drink tokens. That was in the bag. I wouldn't come back the next night if it were me. I would want to make sure that we were gone. But I think that could be a better target for your lost object spell. That's what I was thinking. Yeah, it's a prize. It's a reminder of your good job. Hang on. Irena. Do you have any new staff members? You mentioned being able to get us friends and other type of services. Where do you find those resources? What's her name? I don't think you did any of that at all. I just think you might know who did. Even if you don't consciously know, I think you have an idea. If I wanted to go hock some stolen goods, where would I go? Who? What, the Fitz and that guy? It's a repeating crossbow. How do they remind you? Plus, we would love to pay for your crossbow, but we're currently light. Wait, who wandered in here before? And, just while we're talking, you wouldn't happen to know of any criminal undergrounds, thieves' guilds, pickpocketers, people of the night? Roamers of shadows? I threw mine at a troll. Subcontractor work isn't too bad of a living. As we leave, I grab the bolt that he shot into the wall over Caleb's head. As we walk over there, I say Hey, Rissa. You got a good dad. He really loves you. Sometimes family names aren't all that they're cracked up to be. What's more important is that he really cares for you. Don't take that for granted, all right? And I slap her on the back and keep walking. I was going to say, me and Jester hold hands and we skip off. We talk in here, or are we going to take them outside? I look back at the boys and I say Sit the fuck down. Here's the deal. This guy's super fucking charming. He's going to talk to you first. You don't want to talk to me. Deal? My man Fjord is up! I crack my knuckles, intimidate them a bit from behind. I pull out my staff. Do a cool little flourish. I take a few steps forward. Oh, Jesus. It's not really my strong suit. Oh, that's not too bad. 13? Okay. God, my staff is just vibrating-- I don't know about this, Fjord! You know, in this case, I would weigh between your livelihood and your life. Can't have one without the other. I crack my staff on the floor and I say Get fucking moving, then! Yeah. Blemmy might know the girl. Did you lick it? Through the residential district. I think it's the best way to go. He totally fucking did. No, it was the guy with the nasty fucking beard. Duncan! That was his name! Right, the guy that you drank across? Wait, was Duncan the nerdy guy? Is there a roof to this thing? I parkour on the roof. Ooh! 25. Are there any chimneys? Soft spots in the floor? Skylights? I'm going to peek in. Can I see down? (fake coughs) Okay. 14. Goggles. What do they look like? Okay. They're just huddled together, you said? (whispers) Four individuals. Huddled around. They're either the assholes or hostages, it's hard to say. Hey, I'm going to-- I'm going to very gingerly lean over the edge of the roof where Fjord is. I'm going to say (whispers) On the boom! I'm going to go back over to the chimney very gingerly, pull out one of the firecrackers, one of the bottle rockets, light it with the tinderbox, and drop it in. Is the chimney wide enough for me to fit in? Santa Claus-style? You guys are at the front. Fuck! (coughs) (coughing) Sorry, wrong pipe. Keep going. (coughing) As I cough my way down the chimney, "I'm coming!" I'm a little late and I look at the girl and I say It was you! Sorry. Look, because you were so good at your job, keep this. I hand him 20 gold. Look, I appreciate good work when I see it, all right? You got our shit. That was pretty damn good. Is there anywhere they take kids? Kids separated from their parents? Or do they just not care? So you're just avoiding them. And we start a children's band. Yes, exactly! But it's still another three or four days. But insight check has become such a thing! But the DM hates it! Of course they're bullshit, they're fucking cards. From Hupperdook? Hang on. This thing has been a problem for years, the clockwork warden? Why don't we just go, finish our stuff, we have to cross back through here, anyway. And come back and finish the job. Of course I do. They've been scrappy for long enough. They can be scrappy for another week or two. I mean, Nott's over here trying to pull my heart strings, but it seems like you should be the target. You have a thing with kids and orphanages? Separated from dad? You know, I'm interested if there's a master lever to this prison. Just prison break, see what happens. All right, if we do this, I think we need to give ourselves a hard time limit that we all stick to, because the last thing that I want is for the fucking Gentlemen with his vials of our DNA coming after our asses. I have a feeling The Gentleman isn't a guy that negotiates on time periods. I guess it doesn't hurt to ask The Gentleman, if worst comes to worst. They have 30 gold on them. Caleb, how long does your string theory work? What time is it? It's a fingering? And Yasha? Oh, that's true. That's true. Sorry. Forgot what time it was! Hey Kiri, show them your music box. He's going to make some protection. Such a good game! That was funsies. We got the money back! Oh my god! Yo, you can buy it or you can collect all 48 pinecones and then you just unlock it. It's like that. Yeah, plan. (bass guitar melody)
