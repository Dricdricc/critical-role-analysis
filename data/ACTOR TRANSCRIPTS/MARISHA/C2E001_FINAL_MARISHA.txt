It smells like wood in the studio, like fresh wood. Yes, we do. They will be releasing one week after we are live. We'll be one week behind. They will be releasing on Thursdays the week after. Napster. Afterwards. Our announcement is our brand-new opening title sequence. Which I think we're ready for. Wait, super fast. We've got to go through credits. Right? Okay. So normally we don't do this, and I did this once before when we released our other opening title sequence. Yeah, 50th. So we're going to do this again. These are just people who do so much and who do not get enough love. I'm going to shout them out. Sean Becker, who's the unsung hero of Geek and Sundry, he's the executive producer. T.J. Rotell, he's our production manager around here, he makes sure that we actually have cameras. Maxwell James, our producer that makes this show go every week. Dani Carr, our production coordinator, also huge producer here. Steve Sprinkles, who directed that amazing opening title sequence. I know. I love it on the slate. It always says 'Sprinkles'. Jan-Michael Losada, who is our D.P., and is the same D.P. from last time. Tristan Savage-Tate, our first A.C. Sean Delahunt, who is our key grip. Tyler Hart, who is our gaffer, who gaffs everything around here, he's amazing. Jenny Newman, who did the amazing wardrobe. She sourced all the wardrobe. Wren Witting, who's one of our hair and makeup artists. Vanessa Marie, who is our second hair and makeup artist. Jose Sosa, who was our production assistant. Selina Ruthe-- I know. Selina Ruthe, who did additional photography, and she also does stuff every day. Because I didn't know there was going to be this many. Brandon Clark, who was our location manager. Pamela Joy, who shot all the photos for that, and Loretta Ritchert. Jason Charles Miller, who does our music. Sean Hudson, who does our post-production. And Andy Inglat, who edited that thing. Okay. I'm sweating a lot. Not yet. Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'm, you know, simple girl, simple needs. Just wearing nice, baggy clothes, some monk vestiges. They're in nice blues and greys. You notice I have a blue sash around my belt. Got a nice shave going on, little undercut. Looks like maybe I put on makeup two days ago, and I'm like, yeah, it's still holding up. It's fine. I can work with that. Beauregard. Oh yeah. Sorry for being a pessimistic asshole, by the way, when we first came into town. I'm not used to things turning out good. Yeah, yeah. Oh wait. We're supposed to at least say that, right? And then still accept it, right? If he didn't keep a ledger, you know. We wouldn't want to do that. It's rude not to accept a gift, right? It's rude not to accept a gift, right? Okay, okay. How do you split up four gold? We have four gold and there's only three of us. Aw. I will. Okay. Oh, that's good. One for you, two for me, two for-- oh wait, no, wait, math doesn't make sense. I'll give two to Jester, one for you, one for me. And then 22 silver, that's-- Seven! And 16 copper. Aren't you all jealous? Morning. I am, I'm adding my-- 19. I just shout over and I say, good morning, in Halfling. Would you like a coffee? I'd love to buy you a coffee. Why can't they have been looking at me? Maybe they were looking at me. Maybe they were looking at you. As Jester said, you're handsome. Oh, I said your name. Oh, they might have said your name, too. I don't think I've seen you eat anything other than pastries. I'm kind of concerned for your well-being. It's fine, I'm not that concerned. Eat whatever you want. I'll have bacon, some ham, whatever. Do we notice them whispering? Beau for short works. Can I insight check him, see what he's hiding? Okay. What's my insight, I can't remember. 13. I know, we're not making a big deal out it. You're making a big deal out of it. Oh, I asked if she was cold. (laughter) Those are old times, man. That was a different universe. Different life. We were actually going to go without the flyer, but now we also have a flyer. That's kind of true. Yasha. Yasha. Do you perform in the circus, too? Oh, cool. Is that why it says 'No admittance to the elderly'? You don't want to deal with those riley elderly. Or the ill, yeah. Why no elderly, though? Ill kind of makes sense, but elderly? We gotta get so wasted. Yay! It'll be fun! Yeah, yeah. She was awesome. That's why I liked her. Yeah, I mean, you could maybe do something like that in time. Just wait until maybe-- No, no. Are you-- you're superstitious. Yeah? Okay. You-- sure. I mean, what he was working in was-- he was doing a little like-- he-- he's a smart guy. He's a smart guy. Mysteries. Oh, shit! What's his name? Yeah! Yeah! Hey, buddy. Look at this kitty! I think he likes me. Is this a real cat? Or is this a fake cat? Like a magic cat. Is he an illusion cat? Are you allergic to Frumpkins? Oh no! He's one of those hypoallergenic magic cats. I walk away a little bit from Fjord. Man, this Academy place keeps getting brought up. Okay. This was a good way to go for your first. This is kind of therapeutic. Making me feel better, just about life in general. All right. But then we lost it, but then we got it back. Don't say 'that's good'. I immediately grapple him. 14. I'm impressed that you stuck to taking a guy's money in a training game. Meh. Just meaning when she was teaching. I mean, we have to kill Rodents of Unusual Size. We played D&D and we moved crates for eight hours. (laughter) We did, however, then gamble with the other workers and then Jester-- yeah. Jester-- Oh, that's right. We probably shouldn't. We didn't make any money. So. Mask. I'm just fascinated by the mask. Looks well-made. Did you make it? Brewery tour! They're who we loaded crates for, and then we kind of swindled their employee. So beer tour, then circus? Well, if we just montage through a beer tour, we'll quickly get to the circus. To the carnival! I get sauced. Good times, good times. I go, Molly! Molly, hey! Where are the best seats? What? What happened to 'no sick people'? Fair. Actually, here's a deal. We'll make you a good deal. You waive our entry fee and if anyone needs to be kicked out, or any security needs to happen, we'll help you out. Like deputy bouncers. You would be like our boss. Have you ever wanted to be a boss? Like, in charge? I look at him as I take his hand off. What's your name, by the by? Good name. You didn't have to-- maybe let me choose when to tell people-- Well, it's short for Beauregard. That's unfortunate. I mean, it's great. Did kids make fun-- never mind. Can I make an insight check? Is he a creep or is he just-- Natural 20. It's funny, see, my name's Beau because my parents wanted a son. I have a staff, but I also use it as a walking stick, so I like to keep it on me. Sometimes I get a little twinge, a little disc issue. Are you patronizing me, Mollymauk? Can I keep my stick? (laughter) Deal. Convex would be funny. (laughter) Also, little girls don't tend to tell people they're little girls. I just like how everyone says 'falchion'. Oh. (laughter) I turn back to the rest of them. As we're walking over, I say, hey, Yasha, 'cause I was totally on your shoulder, heard you talking about my friend, Jester. Yeah. No, dude. No, she's never mentioned a significant other, so, I mean. Will you hold me through the show? (laughter) How much? Five gold? I'll give you five silver just to have your shrug to sit on so my butt's not on the floor. Oh, sorry. Okay. Yeah, what's it look like? By name. I turn to Mollymauk and go, man, I thought it was kind of lame at first, but this is awesome! This isn't part of the show? I rolled a natural one. Look, Taliesin, it's a bardo. Oh my god! Five. Rolled terribly. Falchion. I know, can't let that go. Oh shit, okay. To RP my tragic one on the first fucking battle a little bit, I'll turn to everybody and go, guys, no, it's part of the show. Molly said that people die. She was just a claque. Okay. And then I run and I'm going to tackle the zombie guy. Can I see if I can grapple him? Just straight athletics. Oh god. Do I keep that? It's not good. (laughter) I go, oh, fuck that. I don't know if that's true, and I'm going to do a flurry of blows and do two, pop-pop. That's unarmed, right? Pop-pop. I do two, right? Yes, I am. So first one, it's plus six? Okay. First one is 19. No, 20. First one is 20 total, and then the second one is 15 total. Okay. Not great. They're d4s, they're just fancy d4s. Yeah. That is four, eight, 11 points of damage. Yeah, that's cool. So it's the one I'm fighting? Oh, that's fucking rad, dude. My armor class is 17. Yup, yup, that hits. Don't worry about it. I'm bad. I turn to Fjord and I go, I'm not a claque, this show's bullshit. In response to him, I say, I thought you said you didn't let in the sick! I come up and I want to do a flying Superman (impact). First one. Okay. 16? I had my staff-- oh, I had my staff, but I said-- It's fine, it's fine. Six damage. I go, oh, come on. I'm going to use my other ki point to do flurry of blows again, and I'm going to try and punch him in the bridge with the remainder of his teeth. Oh. I'll be like, you were so pretty, too. 19 and 18. Natural. And then, okay. Eight, 12, 13 damage. I'll do the uppercut with the other one, and the one that has its teeth in it, I want to go right between the bridge of the nose and get the teeth right in the eyes and break the nose bridge into the brain. You know that thing? Yeah. I grab my gash and fucked-up ribs and immediately turn over me. Can I do a perception check or an insight check on any of the ringleaders? On any of what was going on? The ringleader or the jester? Oh, thank you, man. I'm really down. That's amazing. That's great. Yeah, what's with the dwarven girl? Why-- How'd she come to you? She's a pretty young girl. See, it's interesting, because I would say the opposite. I would say it wasn't that coincidental, because-- Yeah, you also happen to be very explicit on your page that you don't want the sick, so. Jester. Jokes are great until they get you killed, man. She's joking. This is the King's Guard guy? What's your name, man? Flynn. How long you been doing this, you said ten years? Oh. Happy ten year-i-versary. Yeah, congrats. Did you get a nice watch or like a commemorative tankard? Shit. Did you get a commemorative tankard? Forget the watch part. I'm not moving, man. Hey. Hey, Flynn. Hey, man. How about first we put the swords down, because we helped? Yeah. Beau, same as him. I meant the NPC Bo! But it works! I know, we got paid the first time we helped, and then we got arrested the second time. I don't know what lesson to learn here. It feels so weird. I used 100% new dice. No repeats from Keyleth. Should we all say in case you're Sam and you don't know? He's a prima. Thank you to our amazing crew.
