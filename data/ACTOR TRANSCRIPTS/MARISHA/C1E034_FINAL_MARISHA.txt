Are employees eligible? Hope it does well. Yeah, and last week when we weren't here. Two comics! You can find those comics at geekandsundry.com. They're awesome little four-panel weekly comic strips going through the backstory of Vox Machina at the Winter's Crest Festival. Not at all, Sam! Of course! This is all free through the Geek and Sundry website. You should! After the show. It's us being cute, surrounded by all the sadness. We have yours. There we go. Oh, is it sold out again? Certain sizes are? And terrified. Do it, it's fine. We're just starting. We haven't done anything. Grog, speaking of. How many health potions do you have? I feel like we might need to redistribute. You should do that. How about safety for your life because we'll be having your back and whatnot? I'm going to let that one go. That's possibly very true, actually. Cassandra. Has there been any instance where the two have separated in the recent months, that you can imagine or remember? Can you think of any reason why they would separate? Something sudden that required their attention. In the sun? Plus, we'd just abandon this entire revolution that we caused? Are we going to try and separate these two? Is that the plan? The sparkles are magical. Following up the ranks with Trinket, I guess. So happy to have you here. Is she glowing? I'll be in charge of guiding Trinket. He's still my friend. At least the bear still loves me. Hopefully, we won't be in a hurry. That's for Trinket? Can I cast Gust of Wind really quick and push it back down the hallway? That's true! We're immune to fear and poison. Also, doesn't your belt of Dwarvenkind have something like that? No? Okay, never mind. I know it's hard. It's deep underground. Hey! No, it's fine. I'll just leave it. It's fine. How big is the door? Yeah, something's going on here. So Pike and I are going up. Percy and Cassandra, does this material mean anything to you? The bronze? Does it keep any type of energy out? Why build a room out of bronze? And the floor is bronze? I don't even know. I'm not great with magic. I'm great with nature, and I'm not great with dungeoneering or anything like that, either. Can I do some sort of nature check to see if this is a quarry that we just walked into? A conductor, yeah. It's not really a nature thing, though. Okay. Not my forte. Oh, natural 20! And would I gather any information on the purpose of this room and what it's used for? Oh, we're too far away to see what it's made out of? There's no vents? There's no ventilation shaft, there's nothing? Sure. You've got this. All of those sound like bad ideas. I'm with Scanlan. I say we just go. But maybe mine and Scanlan's is a good idea. Question. Are the stones mathematically adjacent to each other? Do they appear to be lined up? And they're all lined up. Okay. I'm going to walk in a little bit. Are there any on the ceiling? Natural one. That's good metal! Good craftsmanship, damn. I think we all have earrings right now. Well, hang on, while Grog goes and lifts the thing. While Grog does that, do I have any idea where we are geographically in the city, underground? So probably not under the Sun Tree. Okay. I touch another one! Pike. Come on, guys. No, maybe if we all think about the strength of our friendship and bond together. Can we hear each other through the glass? I'm going to go ahead and cast Thunderwave. Maybe this shit can only be taken down with magic. No, it's just a push spell, but it's radiant damage thing. But you guys are behind the glass. Well, if it breaks the glass, we won't be separated by glass. You wanted me to try and get us-- All right. I take my staff, crack it down, cast Thunderwave. See if I can shatter this glass. Can I go ahead and start conjuring Sunbeam? Okay. No! Can I go ahead and on my-- I'm assuming I have spigots in my room? We're each in individual rooms with our own spigots? Okay. While they take out the gems, these earrings work telepathically, right? Okay, I'm going to back into the corridor while you guys handle the gems and start talking to Vax. Or the ramp, whatever. Can I start talking to Vax over the comms? I start talking to Vax. Vax. It's Kiki. Don't forget who you are. You are stronger than this, you are stronger than them. You are not a Briarwood, you are Vox Machina, and we can't lose you. I can't lose you. You're our only hope. Please. You can overcome this. Please. I couldn't take Move Earth because we needed Sunbeam. I have Wall of Stone. Do there appear to be any weak points in the metal anywhere? The acid that's filling in melts that? Okay, well, that changes things. Does my Control Water spell, would that work with the acid? He rolled an 18. Can I help her out? Hold on. Use your dagger, and seeing what she's doing, I'm going to cast my Heat Metal spell on it, and start heating and melting it. Yeah. We destroyed two. How many gems are left inside? I think going outside is a good idea. Go outside. Come on, Vex. I'm going to switch my Heat Metal spell over to the other spigot. Oh, okay! Still keeping my Heat Metal spell up. Fuck! The one I was touching? I'm going to put my hand on it and do-- I'm going to do another Thunderwave. Bam! See if I can Thunderwave crack it. They get killed by not a lot, or a lot? 11 points of damage. Okay, out of frustration, I see this, can I do a wall of stone from underneath the glass to try and lift it up? Not great. Oh! I get advantage on wisdom, right? Fucking shit. Balls. Wisdom. Just wisdom? Eight. Bye, 5th-level spell. I've still got that Heat Metal up. It's still up. It's a concentration spell, yeah. Scanlan, what do you see on the other side of where you are? We can't open the door. Throw a rope over to get over. Yeah, I was just going to say. Fucking fuck you, David Tennant. (laughter) Rope. Wait, that was on that empty barrel? He didn't know who it was for. Oh, Percy. It's true. Oh my god. I still critical failed. God, it's cold in here! Jesus. Yeah, mine are failing me. Fucking shit. 16. Do I have any geographical idea of where we are in the city? Is this located under the Sun Tree? I'm damaged, but-- I'm afraid they're marching him to his death. We'll have to heal in battle, if we need to. What's the plan? I tell Pike real quick, Pike, we are right under the Sun Tree, which was dedicated to the god Pelor. This tree might end up being our best friend in this fight. Keep that in mind going forward. Yeah, are they on good terms? Should we flank and go? How many feet? 50 to 60 feet? Probably out of the same glass bullshit. See if he can stall. Tell him to stall. We're flanking on the far side. I'll go with Grog. Guys, thought for a second what if Percy goes as a distraction? Percy goes first. But they might be able to see through that. Use Percy as bait while the rest of us go up. That's why I said send in the real Percy. My heart is pounding. We've got this. Does the building seem-- is it completely encased? And they're already inside? We have to stop them before they close these doors. If they close the doors, it's over. Percy, go. Get their attention. Percy! When I look up, can I see the ceiling now? Can I see a root system of a really deep-running tree? Fuck. Okay. Okay, as he's distracting them, get in position? Try and stealth behind these buildings? Yeah. It looks like there's pillars and shit? Yeah, let's come in from the back. I don't know what the gnomes are doing. And I'm going to, if I can peek around the corner, start lighting up Sunbeam. They're in a nice, pretty line, and I like it. It's hot. (laughter) I have the shittiest fucking initiative rolls. Yeah, so is mine. Nobody. We all ate it. Fuck. We don't get the drop on them because we were sneaking around? A slight shimmer? Take this spoon? TALIESIN and Bitch. Oh boy. Can you help Vax? You're really close to Vax. Bringing up the rears. Good roll. Oh, that's right! Oh my god! He rolled three sixes and a five. What you going to do? Good thing you don't use strength. Oh, god damn it, what are you going to do? Come on, Grog. You can hear all the dice he's picking up. Oh! Finally. Okay, running up the stairs, running up the stairs-- Beautiful. Can I move to where I'm in a nice pretty line with a Briarwood and Cassandra? Over here? And Sunbeam! Right in a line. I've been waiting. 17. 15 plus eight, so that's 23. 23. Yes. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on saving throws. And I don't know if this makes any amount of difference, but for the duration of the spell, I have a 30-foot radius sunlight glowing in my hand. So it's bright in here now. Yeah, it's a 30-foot radius. With disadvantage he still crit, how? Oh, you-- yeah, right. 41. You're so far away. Yeah. How many of those fuckers does he have? He gets three every turn?! How are you? He wants you. He wants your bod. He's got more where that came from though. He's a very inspiring person. Knock her out. Me? Okay. How close am I to Sylas? Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. Seeing that Sylas is distracted, I'm going to run up, and I'm going to put my hands on his back, and I'm going to cast Sunbeam through him and try and hit Lady Briarwood as well. Then I just hug him, and I'm like, (sings) Let the sunshine in! MARISHA, LAURA, TRAVIS, and I'm trying to do a concentrated Sunbeam. I don't know if it's going to help. Balls, fuck, shit. Ten. 25, total. And I take my nails and dig them in a little bit. Hits. Oh, wait. Hang on. Okay, has to be over 12, right? A saving throw? 17. Feral? Okay. Look at that sexy hand! Roll like you're Percy! Yes! Of course. High rolls. Big money, no whammies. It could be worse. Throwing bullets. Okay, so I turn and I start shouting to the mist and I say, what's the matter, Sylas? Afraid of a little gnome and a druid? And I blast him with Sunbeam. Thanks! I'm not good with lines. Keyleth isn't good with lines. Are you afraid of us? I heard Percy try to do lines, and I'm like, that's what badasses do. Okay. Pike is standing right next to him? I'm going to use Pike and use the light that I have off Pike and combine it to do a joint Sunbeam, holy bomb. Boom. Yeah, I want him to eat a bag of holy dicks. Now explain that, please. Make it sound great. Yeah, way cooler! I knew he'd bring it through. High five, Pike! Yeah. Can I use my sunlight that I have up? My staff? Can I go for a trip? Fine, I'm going to bean her in the head. Natural 20! 12 damage! Bam! What's up, Pike? Not on me. Not today. So he wouldn't disintegrate with it? We have to find her. She's somewhere close. Bigby Gloves? Can I go up next? I'll go. Who's up there right now? Me. Yeah, good call. We have Ripley's gun. Are we running late? It's fine. Crew hates us. The orb is floating? She splatters her blood on the dark sphere? One. Can I try something? Am I able to try something? Is she still bleeding all over this orb? While she does that-- It's not going to work, but I can try. Okay, so you could argue that our bodies are made of 70 percent water, right, so if I cast Control Water, can I move her blood? So wiping the blood off probably wouldn't work? "How good do you feel about a natural 20?" Well, judging by the shit that's been going down today-- fuck it! I already said it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do Control Water and I'm going to see if I can suck all the blood off of the orb. Okay. Oh, did you see that? It was on a 20. 15. No. Coup de grace. At least distract her. Come on, Percy. That was a 12 on a d12, which is dope. No. But you were at 76? TALIESIN, MARISHA, and Can I cast Hold Person? On her? Yes! Oh, I can't hold her? I thought you were going to die. Pike! Is it because we're in this fucking room? I'm going for the black thing. Get her out of the room. Get out of the room! What door is open? She's already dead! Yes. How many? Is she over? You're touching her. You're near her. You're not going to die. You're saved! Can I throw Vax something real quick? Can I toss him something? No, before he runs that way. Can I toss you the Immovable Rod? Never mind. I'm trying to get to this black hole. I'm alone with the little ball, aren't I? Okay, I'm going to go up to it. Can I tell any type of magical properties from it from looking at it? Oh, Jesus. Oh, that's good! 19 total? What is the net of dead bodies doing? Are they limp? Even outside of this building? Would my Sunbeam still be up? I pull out a piece of that green glass that we took from before. I'm going to jam it into it. That's a natural 20. Nothing happened to it? Still just-- It's indestructible. I can try and tear this whole building down. I still have my elemental shape. I can go earth elemental and start ripping this thing apart. I think something was going to come through that orb. Okay. Everyone, get out. Am I tearing this place down? I'll stay behind. Being an earth elemental and ripping it apart. I don't know if that's enough acid to take down and destroy a thing. Do we want to leave a spinning black hole of death under the city? You guys go. I'm going to tear it down. I'll be okay. I'll meet you there. I stand at the top of the temple, and I wait to see them go out of range. Vax, go. No. Go. I concentrate for a minute, and I go into the ground. Even Beast Shape? Never mind! Run! (laughter) Oh my god. By one point. And would become what? Thank god you took that fucking potion! I think Pike's playlist is up right now. That won't work.
