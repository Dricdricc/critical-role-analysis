Der 'n' Der! You took, like, a failed Californian sketch and turned it into Oscar-winning material. Hey-oh. Yeah, I'm probably going to. Big room, did I say square? Man, we're being so transparent. It has returned-- Oh, my goodness, you guys! The amazing Darin De Paul, already. He kicked off the season. Yes. Yeah, he kind of set the bar really high. You guys know Darin as the voice of Reinhardt from Overwatch, and many other things. But-- He's great. (laughs) Wow, I haven't heard of that one. Sigil Boost. Yes, it's back. You should watch it. Yup. People. On Tuesdays. Amy Dallen is up next and-- Yeah. It's good people coming up. Yes. We do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They went fast. (laughs) Yeah. That's right. [opening credits] "Apparently" Uh, no, we're totally watching this. Big roll! Big money, no whammies. Come on, come on. You know, second has its advantages sometimes. Sometimes. Oh, yeah. Is there popcorn in the studio? Damn it! Always the bearer of bad news, that one. Waiting for you to go first? It's totally-- He just Jedi mind-tricked you. I feel like this guy's special, too. Awesome! Brian Fostah. We believe in you, Grog! That's a really good British candy. His AC's 23. (laughs) When Grog becomes Popeye. What would you have done if you shat your pants on that fifth step? Just lost your bowels. Like a very dedicated marathon runner. Agreed, yeah. Like war drums, yeah. (joins in on the drum sounds) Totally. Ask him. Quivering Palm? Oh, my god. (whispers) He does. Good night! We'll see you in the morning, sleep well friends. I want to learn that trick. It's like the possum trick. He's over 9000! Give him the chair! Be careful, that's how blood diseases are transferred! Be careful! Show him what you've learned! None of us know what you learned though! We can't help you! Everyone is doing their Keanu impressions. Ooh. (clap) (quietly) No. No. You're coming back. C'mon. Oh god. Come on, come on. (claps) (deep voice) Show me-- (whispering) Kill him. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Aaaah! (gasp) Uh-huh. Is that lightning available to you all the time? (all yell) As we walk out, Keyleth throws a little gust cantrip to kick up the dust behind us. It just looks really dusty and epic as we walk off into the sunset. Wait, fire, lightning, and what? Lightning, fire, and cold, and double damage? What do they do Grog? What do they do? Well, I mean, okay And that's how Grog was beaten to death by a purse. Yeah, an old lady trying to cross the street and takes out Grog. You have the hit points of a kitten right now. Yeah, like five. Yeah. I mean if you're a wizard. It has been a while for you, hasn't it, Grog? Those things go together! That's great. Yeah.. that's exactly what B & B means. I mean, we can try head back to Whitestone and get Grog healed up and check up on Scanlan. It's true. Vasselheim hasn't been touched, right? (sneezes) Sorry. We should definitely do the research. I know! He's asleep. In a coma. My time is valuable. I know, I know. Oh, this guy. That took all the money from him? Did you say 'a leek'? Where's his shipment from? Did he come out? I thought he came out. No, sorry. Yeah, the Makey Mace-- the Mickey Mouse-shaped one? Those were great, with the ears. I'm all right. Give it to others. We're going home, right? Are you gonna slide by the temple? Oh, that was great. Yeah, that was fu-- -- oh my gosh, that was before we were together. That was good times. (all laugh) Right, yeah. Why are you saying it like you have to go to the toilet? Does it feel like that? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. (laughs) As Percy walks by. (laughing) You have to hit send. What are you afraid of? What do you think she's gonna ask of you? You think she's gonna cash in on that bargain? I thought you already considered paid up in a way. I don't know. Sure. Okay. What are you asking of me right now? Later? Do you wanna go now? While we're here? You're sure? So, just getting this straight. What you're proposing is a Raven Queen-slash-Velvet date night visit back to Vasselheim? Like, you go to church and then we go to the casino? Sure. Mm-hm. Okay. I mean, the fact that any of us are still doing that is impressive at this point. Okay, so that will be-- that's a good date night to look forward to. Let's go home, I guess. Way down the line. Sure. Are you sure you don't wanna just hop in the Raven's Spa, tonight? Uh-huh? Yeah. Are you okay? You're a little-- you look a little sweaty. Yeah, you've got the Julia Roberts vein going. (laughs) Don't worry about it. You're right, you're right, all right. Let's go. Let's go. Everything's fine here too, by the way. No, we're never awkward. Huh? I could do a tree. Huh? Yes, yes. If wizardry is Bob Fosse, druidism is Twyla Tharp. I might know my modern choreographers. Okay? Let's go back to Whitestone. It does not make that sound. That's what you're trying to do. It does not sound like that. That is not canon. They don't. Trees don't fart, they poot, okay. The Cantrip Gust. Is one called the House of Bosoms? It's like the House of Cards of porno. IHOB Keyleth takes a little bit of the gunk off and what is it? Look. How do you think druids discover things, okay? Someone has to figure out what's poison and what's not. This is funny. This is funny, was this you? This is funny! You clearly have some very intense dreams, Scanlan. Definitely not true. Scanlan, do you think any of us could have gotten here without each other? I thought you knew that more than the rest of us. Maybe we just thought you didn't need us as much as you felt like we didn't. I did too. Scanlan. Do you wish we wouldn't have brought you back? Should we not have done that? Scanlan-- Yeah, you're a better father than most of us have ever had. I'm sorry if we had selfish intentions. Yeah. Grog knows what I'm trying to say. Scanlan, as much as you can say that you were just the funny guy who played music and made jokes, I don't think you realize how desperately we need that. That's nothing to scoff at, that's not a talent that many of us naturally possess. You've taught me so much about the brightness of the world, and to look at the light side of things. That's not true. You do care. (timidly) Hey-- hey, guys? We're friends, right? Are we friends? That's fair. Where're you going to go? What're you going to do? No. No it didn't. He doesn't hate us. I just... think we've all just discovered that maybe we have a lot more secrets about ourselves than we've all ever let on. I dunno. I think Percy's right. We're worse than friends, we're family. And family leaves. Can we not be family? Can we, like, redact that? So what, just-- the half-elves are left alone in a room covered in pudding? Crying. Angry. Do you think that if we would've not covered the room in pudding, that he would have stayed? And you had to stay in a shitty BnB, a brothel and-- (laughs) Oh, right, Pike. Right. Yeah. We could always go back to Vasselheim and pick up on that little drinking. Yeah. I mean, we can drink anywhere. Vasselheim doesn't have to be in that equation. I have to go to the water ashari. I have to. Pike, you know the Ozmit Sea. You've sailed it, yeah? We might need you for the water ashari. Seems like-- I guess all of us are picking up on our own individual paths from here? I guess. Is Scanlan right? Have we become too close to each other? Do we need to all take our individual time like we've done in the past? 'Course. What are you getting at, Vax? And then I look at Vax and Percy, and say-- Oh, sorry. Vax and-- --Pike, and say And my takeaway is that maybe we were forgetting who we were before we all banded together. And then I leave the room. It's the basement in Westworld. We all just go catatonic. I chase down Vex, and we do the same thing. No, we know. I see Vax the next morning and I say, Look, your sister gave me one of her blue feathers. It's because this is the darkest timeline. It's because this is the darkest timeline and I stole it from you. What did you do last night? Worked? You were productive. You made the rest of us look and feel like shit? What did you make? Did you bake a cake? I hope you baked a cake. I really want coffee cake right now, Percy. Is it a new day? I thought it was still yesterday. My staff is charged. We also have research we have to look at that we got from that lair of Raishan's. I feel like if I teleport I'm gonna puke. You are not-- -- frat-boy one-shotting me this. Why this? Fuck you, motherfucker! We need to look at this research. We need to figure out what Raishan had going on. I know. Are my eyes puffy? Do I have bags under my-- thank you. I help Percy figure things out. Yeah. Yeah, we can. That's not on us, though, it's on him. Me? I pull out the scrying eye. Can I hold it out in front-- this is kind of flavor-- and I let it levitate in front. Can I open it like a fortune-teller's spying sphere type of crystal-- That would be really awesome. 5.1 Dolby digital surround. Oh my god, so many lagging issues. Oh, I'm spying on those bitches. He took his armor off? He's just regular clothes? Oh, right, yeah. South of Whitestone? He looks content. Happy, even. I feel like he's like flicking off a bunch of trees now. I don't know. He was always an odd one. He did, yeah. I never knew his animosity toward trees. I don't know. (all laugh) LIAM and Just really hates oaks. I have a feeling there's little chance we could talk him out of it. Well! All right. He's living a nice, happy, content, low-key life now. Let's continue on. Yeah, he did He saved the world, what more could we ask of anybody? You know, there's merit to that. All right, let's go. That's literally it. I don't know if they've ever had, like, an in depth conversation. (all laugh) Show him your titties again. As I cast the spell, I just say, Hey, Sun Tree? Watch over Scanlan and Kaylie, okay? And then go though. Tree lag. It's the worst. Yes. Hey! (gasps) It's basically the Vision? Ah, okay. That couldn't have been more uncanny! Hoooly shit. Darrien Darriton? Sam Tary-ann-- Taryon Darrington. It's like our retainer fee. This fucking asshole, am I right? This fucking asshole. I know! You're all pieces of shit. (yelling) I don't like change! Bullshit. You're going to make Laura cry. Look what you've done. (yelling) Fuck you, Ryan Green! Fuck you! You were part of this too! Yeah, what do you do, Tary? We trust you to judge. Hell no. Oh-ho-ho-ho. Keyleth uses a fog cantrip and just fades into the alleyway. It's like we're in a Western when they cut back to the tavern and everyone's gone. (laughs) Nah-jah! Man, I fucking hate this guy. What! Vex! What?! And I just say I knoooow. Um, Vex. Huddle. Is 50,000 dollars worth dealing with this annoying piece of shit? Look, it just feels like when your guinea pig dies as a kid and then you immediately get another guinea pig to replace it? This doesn't feel good. No! I just, I don't want another guinea pig! He's a fabricator! He gets ghostwriters to write all of his books, I bet he does! I don't like new people right now, as of yesterday! No! You guys, he's like the worst alter-ego version of Percy! He's a rich kid who just buys all of his cool toys. No offense, Percy. It's true though! He's not legit! Oh yeah, what if he is Hotis? How do you know, Grog? And then he's gonna take credit for dropping off a hand, like it's some crazy, miraculous thing! No! I don't care. It's the principle of the matter! Grog! Grog! Grog! Grog! Grog, no, no, let go, Grog drop it, Grog drop -- Drop it, drop it, good boy! Grog. Okay, but I'm-- -- gonna be pouty about this. I hate him so much! Vex! Vex, kick his ass! Kick his ass, Vex! You're like all the bad things about the internet as a character. No! Grog, no! Do not show satisfaction in the things he says. Grog! You were on the Critical Role wikia last night weren't you? Yes! Get him! Get him!
