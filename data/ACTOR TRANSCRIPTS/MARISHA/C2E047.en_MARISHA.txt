Yes! Make sure there's no titties, you can't show nips. Nope, this is fine. Yes, it is. That's totally Ciri. There you go. Work it. That's the point of all of this. 22. Ooh! Okay, okay. What are we doing? What's happening? Do you want to flank and we can kind of peek in? Do a little scouting? The crustacean things? Okay. Yeah, let's do that. Nott and I will get in position, flank the door, and hold our attacks in case something runs out. Yeah. Go ahead and use my bonus. Right, and then hold my action. Right? So I'll do that and use a ki point. None of us can really see. (slamming) Natural one. (laughs) Happy 2019! I turn to the group and I go One's coming your way! Jeez louise. Oh, and I get to add a d4 from being blessed? Okay. 11. Still not good. Miss. Yep, my armor class is 19. Bracers! Oh, thank you, Gil! 21 plus a four from Bless, so 25. Ugh, no, I'm not into that, no! Is that all of us? Are we done being stunned? You killed him! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Someone hit it. Thank god. Did my stun wear off? I might as well. It would go to waste, anyway. Right? I'm going to have two on me? Plus seven. 24. Plus another four with Bless that I didn't do. That's a regular old off-hand attack, right? I think I'm still good. Six damage. Plus a d4. Plus another three, so 17. Both times. 22? 14. So sorry. I'm so sorry. I haven't gone. I'm still grappled by both of them, though. Mm-hmm. That sounds like a waste of Beau's time. She is holding on, going to start swinging wildly from where she is. She's going to hit the-- Smoke bombs don't affect their grip. The one that got Phantasmaled. Okay, plus seven, Jesus. 23. No. It's a one. What else can I do? Is there anything else I can fucking do here? Okay. I mean, I can do it on my-- but I still get a second attack here. Okay, 18 plus one, 19. Same one. That's good. Nine damage. I'm going to spend a ki point to do Stunning Strike, for the love of god. Stunned. I'm going to do my bonus. Does Patient Defense matter if I'm grappled? Okay. Copy. Yeah, I'll do Patient Defense. I'll look at the other one and grab his claws and stare him in the eye. Does it move out of my range? Did he hop out of my melee range? Pop, pop. Sentinel. Well, natural one doesn't-- and a natural 20! No, I rolled a natural one. Yeah, I rolled a nat one and a nat 20, so he moves. I'm still alive. I'm doing all right. Everyone's at such a loss. I thought he had his little moment with the little quick goblin. SAM and You said you used the initiative of the one that died by accident. It was coming up on this turn. It's all on one round, was what you said. Because I tried to do Sentinel on it. Okay. Dope. I'm going to do a kick off the ocean floor and I'm going to jump. I want to do an aerial over the two of them to land towards Fjord. As I'm upside down in the air, I'm going to take my two attacks. So dope! I'm going to go for the one that's not stunned first. Come on. That's good! That's a 17. I really need to do math better. 22, plus? 25? Yeah, and then I'm going to try and stun him. Oh. Nine. Jester sees an arc of my blood through the water as I'm bleeding and I cartwheel. Second attack. I'm going to go to the one that's already stunned. This is just a straight roll, right? I've been using my fists as magical. Wow. Cool. Real cool story. Double that to a nice, awesome two. Six. My crit was less than my-- Thank you. And flurry of Beaus. One more time. Pop pop. I'll do the furthest one. Wow that's not cool. 13 plus-- give me a four. 16? Thank you, Bless! Okay, that would have been awesome with that critical. Ten damage. Second attack, same thing. Wait, no, hang on. Six plus seven, so 13-- Yes! 17. It went in between my dice. 17. Six damage. Yeah. Sweet molasses! Okay. This could be awesome. Mm-hmm. Right behind Fjord. Yep, thank you. Okay, you want me to see if I can punch this guy first? Okay. I'm going to take my staff for this one. I'm going to, between Fjord, go Excuse me! See if I can get it. Get! Get on! Oh my god! Why does this always happen to me? Yeah, that's pretty good, though. 21. Okay, that's 18 plus two, so 20. No, for the disadvantage first attack. Right? Disadvantage? So the first one is six damage. No, sorry, seven damage. Three plus four. Then the next one is missing, definitely missing with a two. Yeah, I guess I'll just punch it one more time. Yeah. Through the crowd, grabbing its hair. Jesus, I don't think that's going to do it either, unless-- 14? Yeah. Fucking one-handed bandit. Does this look bad? SAM and I would like to go in and find a little bed of seaweed and lay down for a minute. Is anybody against a short rest? I'm pretty tapped on ki points and-- -- blood. That's old business. We've seen that one. Are you doing your thing? No? Copy. They're this big. Yeah, I have a weird question because you became a champion after-- well, you became a champion, and Avantika was a champion. When Avantika died, someone else become the champion? Ball two. He got one ball. We put in one ball. We got another ball. He has two balls. And we're about to put another ball in there. I'm about to do that. Yeah. The feather was-- Caleb, are you going to Identify these things? Well, the glass sphere makes me nervous. I feel like I heard of things like this before. Can I get a closer look at the skeleton with the armor to see if the armor looks identifiable? No iconography? No identifying symbols? Don't fail me now! Okay. 23. That's a good point. My brain went super elaborate and thought that this chamber crushes people if you fuck it up. That makes way more sense. Oh man. Reverse cowgirl death. While all that was happening, I was picking up some platinum and gold that I found-- Combing the silt, and I've got the armor. Good luck, captain. I look at the runes in the armor that I'm holding. I'll wait. 21. Just the three of us, yeah. So? How do you feel? Like durian fruit? They smell like rotten flesh when you open them. Do you like durian? As a first mate... Do I get a dope first mate kit, like a spyglass? Can I use the spyglass? Oh, I absolutely (whoosh) and then... Yes. Argh! Just straight perception? Okay, okay, okay. Wait, what? This literally happens to me so much! That's better, 21. And you said they weren't flying colors. Okay. I turn around to Fjord, relay that message, say They've got gunports! They're about to fire! I'm so happy! It's a ship fight! I'm getting emotional. I thought-- was she the boatswain? I don't know. Who did the ropes and the sails? Wait, I have this written down. No, you're a carpenter. The boatswain was Caduceus. At least, it was. Oh, because you're the master gunner. I see. Hang on, we're digesting! SAM and So we can do two of these, right? That's what you just said? And the master gunner-- It's legit a minigame! It's Pillars of Eternity, you guys! So, the captain, the first mate, and the boatswain each have access to two special action options described below. Options. Full Speed Ahead, and Fire at Will. And then the master gunner has access to the Pack the Good Powder special action. Can we do each of these actions on our turns, or one of these actions a round? You said run. I think run's a good idea. I think they wouldn't be here if we didn't have something that they want. Do you want to roll initiative, then? 14. You want to do a hard 45-degree turn? If we do that, if we turn starboard side, we can try and hit them with our starboard cannons. If I remember, you could do a few different things. You could whirlpool-- Fire! They might just be pirates. We're thousands of miles away from fucking Wildemount. Captain, I would like to point out, the more people we have to bring on board, the more people we have to feed, or if we don't have enough food-- TALIESIN and We have enough food? All right. Sticking with it. Sorry. They're pirates. I have a feeling Darktow would side with these people-- You've gotten good at those. Right this way, good Levar. Work it, work it, work the gangplank. (laughter) Would I know that, as first mate? No, for supplies. I hand Caleb the leather armor as well. Mm-hmm. 31 silver. 323? I would like to point out that maybe we should set a little bit aside to-- -- pay the crew. Everyone took a second to be like-- Well, I don't know. I can't speak for Caleb, the other empire kid-- Huh? He's busy. I'm from Kamordah. According to the information, they came all the way here to Felderwin, which is where Nott is from. My concern was that they mentioned that they used mountain passages. If you took this mountain passage all the way through Felderwin, you would go along this route. My concern was that you could easily go east in that path and hit Kamordah. I don't know. I have no desire to go rushing back to my hometown. I think I'd prefer to go back to Zadash and check in, personally. What are we going to do to stop an invading army? I don't know. I honestly don't even know if they'd believe me if I told them to run, so what's the point? Maybe we could better organize our efforts together in a larger city like Zadash, or go check in on Nott's family first. Actually, I got a note from my parents when I was at the Cobalt Reserve, at the Cobalt Soul. It seemed very clear that they didn't really want me to come back. My mother actually ended up birthing a son while I was at the monastery, so they got what they wanted. Got rid of me and thought that it would be best if we all parted ways. I took that letter as a goodbye and decided to continue on my way. I have a baby brother that I've never met. Nope. I don't know. I guess I never thought about it like that. I never met the kid. It's hard to feel concern about something you have no real personal connection with, whether they're your blood or not. I don't know. Yeah. I guess he could be okay. I don't know. Anyway, what about you, Nott? Are you here? Yeah, I think so. Should we go check in in Felderwin? Interesting point, though. We forged papers for the Mistake, correct? Do we have papers for the Balleater yet? TRAVIS and Ownership slips? Might want to make some more-- You made the first one pretty good. We'll touch on Nicodranas, forge some papers, check in with Mom. From there, head towards Felderwin? What exactly happened down there, by the way? Are you afraid? Are you in the slightest bit concerned that Uk'otoa might start speaking to you and putting more ideas in your head? Hey, what does your falchion look like? Still have the eyeball in it? Is that still there? Cool, that was my favorite part. It would've been sad if it went away. We're going to go check in on Felderwin. Time might be on our side. Going off of Jester's point, a hundred years can sometimes seem like five minutes for these godly-type beings. Maybe he'll be content for a while. Can it change colors? What's the other thing you're keeping, a rock thing? What's a lucky rock do? Does it allow you to reroll things, like the lucky feat? Said not as Beau, just as Marisha. So what's it let you do? Not generally. I like full range of movement in many things that I do. Oh, fuck, that would be great to have. Everyone else can do that already! That's what it is. It's studded leather. Pretty much everyone can disguise themselves. "I was thirsty." For 23 hours? Yeah, that's legal. Yeah, did you learn how to do that from him? I tell Jester this. My parents, when they were trying to form me into a functional member of society, thought it would be a good idea if I got into jewelry making, so I have a jeweler's kit. I could crush gems, yeah. Just throwing that out there. Just a light Divination. I would like to go to Caleb really quick and be like Hey. Did you happen to finish that copy of Avantika's code for me? Can I get it? Thanks. Yep. I go to my chambers and for the rest of the time, I want to try and memorize her code. Okay. At some point in time, like halfway through, I go back to Caleb after 24 hours with it. I was like Okay. I'm trying to memorize this. I figured it might be useful because you know this code. You memorized this code; you have a photographic memory. I figure if we're ever in trouble, we can write messages in this code. Not too many people know it. Yeah, I've been doing that. (hesitating) Will you help me? Tutor me? It might go a little faster. Okay. I do.
