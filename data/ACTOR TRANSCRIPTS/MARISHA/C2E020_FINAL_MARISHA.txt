Wow, that was so authentic to the actor experience. It's a regional spot! It smells good, too. It smells like new comic. Exactly! Yeah, it's bottomless. In the name of science. A little burny? Is this quickly like "not paying close attention" quickly? Yeah, we're fine. I think he was being genuine. I feel like that was the most emotion-- A little. His ears are getting a little pink. I'll helm. Sorry, 17. Moving? What does the weather look like? Are there clouds in the sky? It looks like the landscape is going dark? Not something moved in front of it, or like something is moving? Who's got good eyes and knows about clouds and shit? Does that look natural to you? If we move, though, we have to move fast, and maybe a little bit carefully. All right. Can I go ahead a little bit and see if I find any hidden paths that might cut through this field, off the main road? Scout ahead a little bit. I have ball bearings. I rolled a 15. How far away is the army? Okay, I'm going to come over and be like I think we should hide and wait until these guys pass with this being the situation. Are we going to get questioned? Nott, you should hide. I agree, what's our story? We're just traveling hired hands. We are going to go to the swamp and look for yard work. Maybe they can help us fix our wheel. Good day. The Labenda Swamp. You included the horse. Have you seen the frontline before? It's fitting that the Traveler helps fix a wheel. It's very poetic. I like it. She did just lift up the carriage. Hey Fjord, have you had any more weird dreams? Are your dreams affected by the weather? Like if it's cold, do you throw up ice shards instead of salt water or something? Because that can be cool. Okay. We don't know if it's seawater, though, right? It could be like saline. Maybe that's your problem this whole time. Are we exposed? Like, out? Can we all huddle under the-- I mean, (snoring) Full tauntaun style. Soaking. I was curious of that too. How close are we to the Xhorhasian border? Oh there's Druvenlode! There's Max Load. I mean, if he was taking the Leonardo da Vinci approach then it could be accurate. Max of Lode! I'm going to get on the cart and try and put my cloak over me. I look at Molly underneath me on the cart and I fart a little bit. Just a little. Sorry. Oh shit! (yelling) That would be fucked up, if you used that as your exit. Wait, where-- what do you mean Ashley left? (whispered) Lemonade. I heard it was bad luck. That's what I was told. Fuck. Attach it to the back of the horse. Go! Yeah! Yeah, how do you mean? You need more incense? What kind of a shelter? Like a dome, like a bubble dome? How do you mean? Beau does pushups while waiting for Molly. I'll be in the cart. I'm okay at surviving. I'm going to take my staff and poke it in the marshy bits. It sounded like an alert to me. (cawing) Maybe it's a mating call. Does it sound like multiple, or from the same source? Is this considered the Berleben path? The Bromkiln. So this is not-- Does there appear to be any sign of wreckage, or anything else that looks like it might not have made its way through this path because of other dangers? 15, but that was a bit ago. That's not as good this time, 12. Nobody move. If you're going to move, move onto the cart. Are we on horses? Something just moved in the water. It might be able to hear our movements, though. It moved away though. I take a ball bearing out and toss it and throw it into the swamp. See what happens. He's probably going to die. Oh man, poor guy. He'll be fine. Would we know if this is the stretch of road that they were talking about, that they were having issues with? What are we saving? I'm still on a horse, yeah? I'm on a horse. Yeah, I'm staying on my horse! (galloping) How cool is that? The thing that we've been hauling around. You have to stare at it for a minute. For the next eight hours? 15! Mm-hmm. From my perspective, it looks like the gator is super stoked about having this lollipop. (heavy quick footsteps) This is so prehistoric! We're the brigade. Are we doing this? Birds die this way all the time. What? It's feathery! What if it's Febron? Am I able to have enough movement to get on this stumpy stump? I don't think I'm-- I'm not within 60 feet of any of them, am I? No, I guess I am to throw a thing. Can I use my bonus to move a little bit further onto the top of this tree? My step of the wind? I can't get within range of them with my step of the wind though, right? Fuck. God damn it. If I move straight? Yeah. I'm going to ninja star for my main attack and if I can-- I don't know if I can-- I can't move on my bonus, can I? Only if I move a ki point. Right. Nah, fuck it. Ninja star. Okay. That's a 20 for the first one. Ooh, and a natural 19 for the second one. These are 1d4s, right? Yeah, I think it's 1d4. For the first one, that's seven. For the second one, that's five. Gambit style! I point at Percy and I go, "He did it!" Oh, I called him Percy! I think that's the first time I've done that! I point at Molly. He did it. Aw! I miss Percy. That's cool! How often do you get to add that? See, now I'm getting Little Mermaid vibes, though, from the gator. (singing) Up where they walk, up where they run, up where they stay all day in the sun. Caleb, or Fjord? Sure. Can I get to this guy who's got Nott? Okay. I'm going to parkour off. I'm going to do a parkour off of the rock and come down and try and get it right in its mouth to try and get it to spit out Nott. So the first attack. That's good. That's a 21. That's better. That's 22. Spit it out! Both of those are the same, which is seven. Uh-huh. I'm going to spend a ki point now to do two more, flurry of blows. That's an 18, and they just keep getting better. And that one's not great. That's worse. That's a 12. You know what? I rolled the wrong damage die for those first two, but that's my fault. Six damage. I rolled d6s instead of d8s. That gator got lucky. Well, wow. Yeah. Question, would this trigger my reaction for Sentinel? Okay. Okay, okay! That's good to know. Oh, this is Nott's turn. Sorry. Now do I get that opportunity attack? I whack it right in the nose, because that's what I was taught with bears. I go No! SAM and They're all the same, in the nose. Natural 20! Be high! Okay! 12 damage? He's going to phone a friend, but in the case the friend is Nathan Stewart. "Hey, Chris Perkins?" It's the chalice dilemma. Hero's Feast with the chalices. Oh yes. It smells a little like tuna, and that's not me, though. I'm telling you. It is a bird person. Maybe he only repeats what we say. How far have you traveled? Do you recognize people that look like her? Matt seems adamant. That can't be good. Would I recognize what species or race of people? Empire kids wouldn't know? The whole studied thing? That's what I was thinking. It's kind of creepy, man. Oh yeah, you've got oats. Let me hold this dagger for just a moment. I'll give it back. I just want to test something. Okay, we're just going to test your reflexes here. No. A little sparring. Punch here, hit here. Can you-- (punching sounds) I just want to see before we give a dagger to a child. To attack my hand? Okay. I don't know if she needs a dagger. Here you go, child. We're going to die first. Can I take a short rest, then, to get my ki points back? That's this kid's parents. The cousins. Yeah, like a Rorschach test. Well, he said that they were cursed, they lost their ability. Her sisters. Parents are alive. We shouldn't go fighting with her. I don't know. We gave her a dagger. Point her in the right direction that her parents are going. Well, if she comes with us, then we will kill her. Unless we can drop her off on the nearest town. Exactly. I don't know, guys. We've seen how people react to Nott around here. What if we drag her in front of some crazy locals? Birds don't like cats. Sorry, cats don't like birds. Frumpkin starts chittering. Then we wouldn't be ironic anymore. Are we cheeky or are we serious? That'll totally change our entire disposition of the group. Yes, it's definitely like 85 degrees. We're all sharing cloaks for no reason. Sorry, it's a humid 60 degrees. We have to look for Febron who is apparently in the Keystone Pub. In the (mumbling) district. I ran out of page-- In the Puddles! It is in the Puddles. I got Pudd. It's stylistic. That's fine. Here. Here's some pocket bacon for your trouble. You seem like you'd appreciate that more than money, so I don't know. See? I swiped from a few places. I would do that. I have done that. I just want to say, wrap it up in a paper towel, stick it in your bag, fine. I pace behind the group and start catching up to him. I match pace with the crownsguard eventually, the one that's following us. I slow behind to match his pace, who's following us. I would hang out here all the time. Evening, sir. Passing through. Feels like trouble would make your life a little interesting, though, wouldn't it? Oh, is that why you're stationed here? Is this by choice, or who'd you piss off? What's your name? No, nothing? Just a little conversation. Just simple, you know, trying to be polite. Beau. Yeah. Crownsguard Alexander. So formal. I get that a lot. Yeah. All right. I will wait because I don't like him telling me what to do and then I will get on my way. Yeah. No, I'm comfortable. I wait, and then I give myself a this for winning that game of chicken. Yeah! Then I climb the rope. This means nothing, and I want to win. You know, if you teach respect early on towards alcohol, though. What's your name, good sir? Looks super cray. What's your strongest drink? What is-- what? Yeah. That. Bender Throat Grog? What do you mean, same color as the swamp? Green and shitty? Oh. I'll take it. No, I've got it. This one's on me. I need it for tax write-offs. Boulder-parchment-shears. All right, you get it. Historical point of interest. That's exactly the magnet that I bought when I got in here. I got a shithole magnet. It spoke to me. Is it haunted? I cover for Fjord a little bit. Just taking space. Just fill it out. This is my bubble now. It is haunted. Bonswallow. We heard about a kooky regular. We just have to meet him. Febron? Febron Keyes, yeah. Don't drink from that again. Don't. Wash that. That's a Wish! Yeah! Beau gives a crack. Half and half. Little gold, little silver. Silver and gold. Yeah, what she said. Look, you got to risk your life for the coin, or we can drag you back, as you said, without any coin. Man, you are so broke all the damn time! You are so broke all the damn time! I'll give you 20. I'll cover Caleb. Make it a good one. One we all know the words to. I want to sing along! I yell at him as he walks away. Free Bird! Yes! Feels very trendy. Let's do it! Do you think he has insurance to cover lost goods? Because I don't think he does. Someone should go with him and we get the valuables off. Wait, does that go with the cart? It's fine, yeah. Was going to say, it's the full Wilson effect. Hey, Jester? What do you think Captain Max-dung, whatever his name was-- Maximilian meant by (exaggeratedly sexy) "I'll see you again." Yeah, like, "Ooh, I hope our paths cross again someday, ooh." And you're like, "Ooh, that's Captain Max." Oh, man, you're like, "I never knew he had such luscious locks, mmm." I think so, too. Do you think he had the hots for any one of us? Do you think that's why he said this like, "I want to see you again." I think he had the hots for you. I mean. (whispering) Maybe it was Yasha. Maybe it was like, "Ooh, I'm a captain." Yeah. Kiri, where do babies come from? She doesn't know what the hell we're talking about. Is that how I sound? Wow, I have a lot to re-evaluate. I have to think about some things. We should go to sleep. I fall asleep 20 minutes in, drooling a little. I need a new notebook after this session. I do. Skulls are bad guys. Oh, you recognized it as a mountain range! That's great! We already had Kit. We already had an Englishwoman. I want full Benedict Cumberbatch.
