Where did that camera come from? Let me see over here! Is that you? Did you do that? That's actually pretty good, man! That's pretty good! I have some fierce bone structure going. I love that you broke rule number one of Pictionary and labeled things! When did you do these? Last night? Are you serious? We left at midnight! Why the pink lipstick, man? Have you ever seen Ashley wear pink lipstick? Although I appreciate her guns and her biceps. Not an April Fools' joke! We went international! Pro-JECT Alpha. Pro-JECT that Alpha. Featuring Satine! Which we timed out pretty well. I think intentionally. I'm not sure. Totally intentionally. So if you don't know who Satine is, get introduced to her with this week's episode of Signal Boost, and then she'll lead you graciously into GM Tips. She's awesome. I have kind of a girl crush on Satine. She's so cool. Yeah, you should go watch her. And apparently he smells like cabbage. (sings) 9th-level spells! Yeah. (all laugh) You okay? Did you have a nightmare? I have them, too. Do you want to talk about it? Okay. Do you need anything? I do a little bit of Druidcraft, something like lightning bugs in the room, and make them dance. Nice and calming, just trying to get back to sleep. As I wake up, before we head downstairs, I grab Vax. Did you get back to sleep? Are you all right? Never? Always. Yeah. No. Sure, let's go! Thanks. Yeah, same. Communal style. Half-elves are just, (gnawing noises). Dwarf, right? Wrong note. Shayne Tranter? See, as I wrote down, I believe Shayne, Cordell, Jarett, Kendrick, and Nitebe get 100 a month. Yeah. And because he was hot. That's right. So, reducing our costs. We're getting better at this. We should have some sort of service, then, or at least a dinner in Cordell's honor. Vox Machina, not returning your calls since 1992. I can try and scry. Want me to scry on Nitebe? I can. All right. I scry on Nitebe. Actually, good question! Yeah, it's only in black and white. Yeah. I'm afraid the insane things that Grog just said is correct. Yes. Travis! Whatever timeline you believe in. There's got to be public record, right? I feel like the city is pretty overwhelmed at the moment, though. How do you feel about your workload? Do you feel like you can handle this? Well, we talked about going to the Cobalt Reserve to drop off this-- And then-- I mean, there's that. Yeah, it's weird. I don't know. Well, not like a fireplace mantle. Although I could, technically, transform into a fireplace now. Because I'm a badass. You know, I could, I'm pretty sure. No, I could! Hang on, hang on! A mimic! Couldn't I turn into a mimic that could be a door? Or a mantle? Can I be a door? We'll think about it. Anyway. It's fine. Yeah. We're very open-minded. Does he have an aversion to wearing pants? All blinged out. (stammers) Well, it's just weird. It's just weird. It's been so long. It's a lot of build-up, and then it's going to be over. I'm serious! He could, yeah. It's just, my whole life has been building up to this, and if we complete it, that makes it real. If I complete it, then I am the Voice of the Tempest. I imagine I can do whatever I want. Right? I don't know. I'm not entirely sure of the difference of what you just said. I guess it is that notion of leading up to this one moment that you've thought of for a while. Once you complete that, what happens next? Is it, though? Yeah? Yeah, sure. It's whatever you guys think is best. We can go to Westruun first, or we can go to Zephra first. Just whatever you want. No, it's the difference of a day or two, right? Do we need an extra day to convince Grog to wear pants? That could be the deciding factor! Maybe we should put it on him. Right? What? (groans) (laughs) Let's check in at Westruun. Drop off the book. We'll head from Westruun to Zephra. All right. Man! Decision-making is hard. So many choices. Good question! Who's importing more? Where's fashion week happening? If it's the Pittsburgh, then we should go now, because everything closes at five. We did mention if we wanted to drop off the book at Westruun or Vasselheim-- Do we want to do that instead? All right! Let's go to Vasselheim. How far north have you been, Tary? You're from Wildmount, correct? It is quite chilly. Let's go. Anything else we need to do before we leave Emon? Tary, Vasselheim does get a little bit-- Arcane magic. Can you do that? I don't think so. He's upset about the notion of pants. This is going to look ridiculous! Everyone's going to be like, that's a robot wearing a mask! Just bluff your way through it. This is the best thing we've ever wasted time on. Where are those pottery tools, Gil? (laughs) It's a good roll. Cher was great in that. Oh my gosh. #secretgoatee. (all laugh) This is the worst thing! Sure. Yeah, I was just going to say, been through a fire! Yeah, let's go. Mainly these three-- Druidcraft. Oh, I think this is your hair-dying robe now. Sorry. And now your-- Does that mean that the-- You're right, now that I've blurred my vision, the glue is the most noticeable part. Hey, where did you learn contouring? (laughs) Because that's really well done. Good point, let's go. It's the elvish half. Vasselheim! And we have the book? We have the book in the chest? Chest and the book? All right. Where? Wasn't there the tree that was near the Slayer's Take? Yeah. We'll do that. Yeah. What do they call it? Never mind. There! Yes, thank you. Because I imagine they'd have a good hiding place? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Correct. And then shops for more potions. That's actually not a bad plan. Okay. You're going to go research Orcus? The twins? All right. Percy, you want to go to the Platinum Reserve? All right. We'll take the book. Tary? You want to come with us or the twins? All right. Grog? Books. Oh, do you want to be team potions? Team Shopping, right Grog? To the library? Which is to the place where they-- (shouts) To the archive! They're right next door, they're connected, they're partners. So, we have the book. They went to the sanctuary. We are going to the library. Okay! You guys, I thought our whole thing was that we were taking the book to the sanctuary and then you guys were like, we're going to the sanctuary, because you guys totally gave me shit when I was like, the library, and you were like, not the library, but apparently we are. All right. Let's go to the library. We said we had the book. I thought we took the book, that was our whole fucking plan-- -- that we took the damn book. But I would assume if we said, "we're taking the book", that would mean-- We have the book. I thought we put it in a box, right? We wrapped it in cloth. Okay. I'm sorry-- I am Keyleth of the Air Ashari and this is Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III. We're a part of the group Vox Machina, we've been through here before, we're part of the Slayer's Take. This is a matter of great importance, so if there is any type of upper management we could talk to-- (all laugh) (coughs) Mm, 11. And yet, worst case scenario, I also have this book that Scanlan read that's on how to be a good leader-- All right, I'll hold on to it. It's a rakshasa. Anyone look familiar? Any uniforms that look recognizable? It's on another dice? All right. Oh, that's good! That's a 19! Perception? 21. Sorry, 20. Yeah, 21. No! 31! 31. Right. Theft protection. Any reason for the sudden spark in interest? Good on them. Can you do that with your toes? Yes. Which one are you opening? Which one are you opening, Percy? The Orcus one? Weird question. Abyssal. I know creatures who are from the Abyss, right? I've encountered them? If I do a Shapechange into a demon, can I then read Abyssal? I would let him know! I would give him like a disclaimer. You keep the same mental stats. But you get the abilities-- In addition. I don't know. What was that demon guy we encountered? Does he have a name? The pit fiend was a devil. Who was the guy who lied to us, and you said devil at one point, and he was actually a demon. Succubus are-- yeah. And they're demons, right? No. Okay. You know what? You're reading the book on the Nine Hells. That'll tell us what fiends there are. Right? Read the book. Yes. (laughs) Does it mention any Abyssal fiends that they particularly hate that we might have encountered? (sings Yakety Sax) So were we supposed to take the book? Or were they supposed to take the book? Well, I also thought we were going to the Reserve and now we're in the library. I'm so confused on our plan. So, it's the realm of Dis and the leader is-- TALIESIN and And the first layer of Hell is also referred to as the layer of Inyimenemo-- what? Avernus. Atlas Obscura that shit. Any information on how to get there? LAURA and I can Plane Shift there. I do a very detailed look at what the Iron City of Dis seems like-- Are you serious? Oh my god. Come on, Grog! Wow. Wyrmwood with a 'y'. We're going to finish up and try and get out, I guess? We want to talk to Kusuo and see. Okay. Thank you. And would it be possible if we bring friends of ours in the future who are-- Yeah, who are fluent in these languages. Thank you. We totally do. I know-- I thought-- You know, I think-- I don't know. Well, some good stuff. We found one book that we could read, and one book that we couldn't. So we'll have to come back with you guys. Because it was all written in Abyssal. Yes! Because your father forced you to do things. We built Dis city. On rock'n'roll. Pittsburgh, yeah. Yeah? (laughs nervously) What did you guys find out? Is it a good spot, a good home for it? Do you want to drop it off? It's like our magical items. It's not easy to destroy them. Seems like a pretty powerful book. But it might not be a bad-- I mean, we did drop off the horn of Orcus here. What? Where? There? Where? You're going to go back to the temple. I'll get things packed? I look at Vex. Oh goddamnit, Pittsburgh. Get it, girl. Get it, get it, girl. I toss them 20 gold. An extra 20 minutes, please. Thank you. What? Mm. You know, it's a little esoteric for me. A little experimental. A little Gaga-esque. You know, it reminds a little of when we dressed Trinket up in pink bows. I don't know if that's a good thing. Make us pretty. I'm going to become royalty. Kind of, but not really. Yes! Vex, this collar is so big. Why can't I see over it? Yeah, can we dip-dye it blue? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Hey! LAURA and Are you broken again? Ah. Yes. Designer. Couture. I know. It's like, look at the beading! It's crazy! In the morning, I'll look at the beading. (all laugh) You're doing really well at perfecting your mystical voice. Yeah, it's good. It's good. I like it. Oh, black and tan. What do you mean by the goods? Where did you keep that? Where'd you just pull that from? Whoa. Jeez. Uh-huh. Right. (gasps) That's so smart. Wow. And probably much cheaper than just buying in bars all the time. Wow. Hey! Oh, sorry. (laughs) What? What did you tell Doty? What did you inform him right before-- Potentially murdered the-- Doty! I might-- Oh. What? You want me to ask Doty? Or you want me to ask Tary? -- just unconscious. Are you sure? Did you check? Grog. Okay-- That doesn't-- Tary, what do you mean you didn't tell him to-- he just did this on -- (sighs) Tary, is this thing safe to be following us around? No way we'd buy that delivery! Can I roll an insight check? That's bullshit! There's no fucking way! What? Oh, bullshit. That was the most bullshit delivery. Mm, mm, 21! (quietly) Grog. Do we need to make sure you're with an adult from here on out? Can you not be trusted alone with Tary? No, no! Do not! Do not be influenced by his very generous act of kindness! That was so kind of you! That was like 6,000 gold worth of-- But do not! Don't! Are you sure they're dead? Grog-- Tary, it sounds like all of the opposite of that is true. Except for the mistakes part, yeah. Vax? Oh, you did not go to that guy, the guy who-- oh no. Insight check! Now you're the fucking boy who cried wolf three times. God damn it, don't fuck me, Gil. Oh, jeez, that wasn't great. 15. That looks like Tary's vomit. Because I saw him puke under the water and it floated right past me. I got a great view of it. He's a nervous puker. But it seems like it might be okay, right? Did you get it? Yeah! Real-life hero. Yeah. Tary, going forward, I think you need to recognize how literal Doty takes things, and maybe think maybe more detailedly on how you word things, maybe? From innocent guards. Yes, let's learn it from you. Hm, yes. Yeah. I mean, we could catch brunch first? All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. It was just Vax and Allura-- Whom we kind of forgot was with us. (nervous laugh) Yeah. (inhales) Oh man. No no no, we're on the mountain. I forgot you guys haven't seen my hometown yet. Okay, all right. Let's go that way. Okay. See, over there is where I caught my first baby griffin-- -- he was lost and got separated from his mom, and I captured him up, and I tucked him up under my shirt. And over there actually-- -- I tripped and fell and that was the first time that I scraped my knee-- -- and I was like, oh no, I'm bleeding. Oh, it was so terrible, yeah. Yes, hi, hi. What's your name? Oh my goodness, Sora. Wow, last time I saw you, you were like, like, oh man. Look how big you've gotten. Do you still know that handshake? Do you remember the-- And there, you've got it. You got it. Yeah, yeah. Oh man. You forgot-- Yeah. I guess I am. Hey, hey. Sora, Sora. Have you seen my dad around? Yeah. Okay. I just drop to a knee and say, Kaitiyaki, father. Yes, we have defeated the Chroma Conclave. The help of Vox Machina and many many others, at the cost of many lives. Yes, thank you. The Air Ashari were very valuable during that day. Very courageous. Sorry, I thought Uvenda might have said something. I'm here because I have completed my Aramente, and have come for my blessing. Still waiting on your final word, I guess. Yeah. Didn't think I'd make it here. I couldn't have done any of this without not only the support of every person in Zephra, and every person of the Ashari tribe, members of Emon, Tal'Dorei, Marquet, even Wildmount. In my journeys, I've learned being a leader is a global effort, one that takes the wisdom of many. Most importantly, I couldn't have done any of this without Vox Machina. And the pieces of them that I've taken away and have desperately tried to emulate in each one of them over the years. Each one of them with qualities that I admire and strive to embrace. Grog, with his strength and his unyielding loyalty. Vex, with her self-confidence and utter fearlessness. Vax is one of the most compassionate people I think I've ever come across and one of the most brave, even if it's maybe foolish. Percival, with your intelligence and your sensibility, is always there to be my balance. Scanlan, with his charisma and his wit. Pike-- Pike, her generosity and her authenticity, always true to herself. And even Tary. Taryon Darrington, whose blind faith in Vox Machina and perseverance, trusted us even though he probably shouldn't have. All of these things that I learned and couldn't be a leader without. Vox Machina makes up me. Zephra makes up me. The Ashari people, and all of greater Exandria. I don't know if I'm the leader that you deserve, or a good leader, but I'm willing to dedicate the rest of my life to doing whatever I can for all of us. As long as Vox Machina stands by my side. What? I get the what now? Oh, what! Well, you guys are out of luck with the charisma modifier shit, but what! (all laugh) That is fucking dope! Jeez, no. Yes. (all laugh) No shit. And send out the next one.
