You’re here, you’re still coming in. Oh man, so many good ones. Yes, I know, it’s going to be tough. I think it’s supposed to be like how our Congress is supposed to work, Yeah, exactly. We’ll see what you want - We’ll disregard it completely and just make our own choice. Yeah, 100% of the proceeds go to - A new host! Stay tuned for the break to see who it is, or if you happened to watch it you already know, but stay tuned for the break for the surprise. Best kind of surprise. That you’ve already heard about. (groans) What about those of us with earrings? 16. Ninjas. Motherfucking ninjas! Oh my god. Ooh! That's not bad. 17. Yes! Aw, he beat me? Hits. That can't be good. Okay... 20, total. On top of I had 9 originally? Right? Okay. So that's... I rolled a natural 19, so 24. Jesus, fuck. He just did 42 points of damage. In one round. Yeah. 42! So there are windows that they came through? They came in the windows? Who are you pointing at? Percy's? But we have windows. That are open to the outside. Good play, good play. Okay. So this guy is by the door, yeah? Or by the window? How far away from the window? Like, is his back up against the window? It's an open window. Bars on it or something? Okay. I'm trying to think which way I want to go with this. I'm going to towards him do a Thunderwave push (boof) and try and push him out the window. Thunderwave. Oh, does he have me up against the window? And he'll get an attack of opportunity, I'm assuming? Oh. Okay, yeah, I'll just shoulder around him. Jesus, I don't know. I don't do this very often. It is a constitution saving throw. 19. He takes 2d8 damage and he is pushed 10 feet. Hopefully out the window because that's what I was going for. That was cocked. 4 damage. And then I'm going to take just - Okay. I'm going to throw open the door and just peek out the door and see what's up. And then I’m going to come over my comm and just say, "Status report, where is everybody?" And that’s it. Meow. The assassin doucher? Bullshit. No! Gun stuff. In relation to where we are? I was going to try and handle that. I’m right behind you. In the room, in the door behind you. Hey, Grog! You want to jump from really high? All right. He’s just holding his action - Okay. I’m going to reach over, put on my circlet in my nightgown. And I’m going to step out, look left and right. Okay. And then, going off what Grog was saying, I’m going to walk behind Grog and I’m going to do Stone Shape. I’m going to blast a door into that wall, blast a giant hole. Yeah. Yeah, dude. Yeah. Okay. Cool. And then I’ll - Can I see Pike from where I am? I’m going to look at her and give her a Healing Word, just a level 1 Healing Word. You are going to heal - Oh, it’s not great. Sorry. I’ll step back a little bit out of Grog’s way. Not that, back towards you. Sure, yeah. So he can get by. Oh, Grog. You can’t do anything? I give him a good-game smack on the ass as he runs by. So is picking something up not a free action? I thought picking up a weapon was a free action. Fucking fuck. Who? Where did he come from? That yours? The little shit. Yeah, no shit. Yeah, don’t do that. All right. Jazz hands? Tiger bomb. Could be an intern. Kill him. Kill him. Oh, this motherfucker. I hope he’s got a Counterspell... (singing) When you’re a Jet, you’re a Jet all the way. I don't know. You know, there’s a mathematical equation for your stripes? Oh my god. Yeah, he’s trying to charm. Trying to charm you, man. Only half of us know how this fucker works. Wait... It was just - was it just me and you? Oh my god, it was just me and you. Yeah. Warcaster. You can cast when you’re on your back. Rakasha! Three-point landing! I am going to... move up, I guess. My full movement. Okay, roughly how far away is he from me now? The rakshasa? All right. Okay. 60-70 feet. First things first, I’m going to cast Wall of Stone, and what I want to do is make it a semi-circle, and wall him in with us. Yeah, wall him in with us. I don’t want us to lose sight on him, but I want to make it like a - A cup. Yeah. Yep. All the way... How long can I make the wall? I can make the wall... I can do 10 by... sorry. If it’s 3 inches thick, I can do 10 foot by - 20-foot panels... It doesn’t really specify right now. Is it supposed to be 10... Okay, right. Right. So I think that’s about right. I don’t want it to be super thick. It’s not very descriptive. And when I do 3 inches thick, I can create 10 foot by 20 foot panels - it says the same damn thing in the book. You create a span of 20-foot length... Yeah. And now I’m going to do a bonus action - see if this works. Okay, I have a 60-foot range here, so I want to cast a Grasping Vine - Fuck, that’s right. Never mind. Then I’m going to take a bonus action and Healing Word Vax. 8 points. How far away am I from Vax? Okay, can I shout at him? Vax! Is that Hotis? Uh, holy shit! That’s my turn. I made a ramp with the rubble. Yeah, I can hear it. Oh, there we go! Oh, you were doing something to it. It’s coming. Kill that motherfucker! I don’t even know what that means! What did you cast? That those things come back. - problem. We watched him die. Remember when we split up for the Slayer’s Take? He was our contract. Nope, Vax and I watched him die. He slit his throat. Yes, it got blood all over the place. Yeah. I think we need to talk to Vanessa, like he said. Yes, be that there are assassins running around, which was not part of the contract before. The beading on it is gorgeous. The rakshasa can disguise - He can shape-shift - Hang on, hang on! Add 6 to my wisdom? Oh, add 6 to the roll from my wisdom. Oh, adding my modifier, right. 14. Wait, does it come off? It doesn't come off. Oh, that’s a good idea. I go and I look for Allura and Gilmore. While they do that. As I’m looking for Gilmore and Allura, I’m alerting the guards of the visuals of the assailants. Three things. There’s a few. (laughs) In robes? As I walk towards them, I want to throw up a Skywrite, once again. The de Rolo crest, just alerting people. Okay. I'm going to cast Polymorph on myself. And I'm going to go as a mouse. Polymorph. Can I fit through the door? I drop Polymorph. It's okay! It's okay! It's me, Keyleth. Sorry. (shouting) I know, I know! (all laugh) Gilmore. Rakshasa. In the town. Pretending to be you. Trying to kill Vax. Yes! Also, a bunch of fucking assassins. (scared) Yeah. (breathless) I found Gilmore. No! This is real Gilmore! Real Gilmore. As he says this, I do a little cantrip Fog Cloud around Vax's... privies. Just a little floating fog cloud. Right around your waistline. The old tutu. A little censor bar. Well, wait. Gilmore. Where's Allura? Where's Allura? Gilmore, if they were after us and they were after you, they were probably also after Allura. We need to make sure that everyone on the Council is okay. All of them. Say nothing? I grab him real fast and say, "It was Hotis, the rakshasa. Remember? From the Slayer's Take." Yeah. Yeah. Let's split up, I guess? I'm going to go look for Allura. Still alive? This assassin came through my window. Yeah. Well, I... actually, I don't know. I chucked him out the window. He might still be alive. A rakshasa. His NAME was Hotis. Rakshasas are devils from the Nine Hells. And Kashaw, wherever he is. We watched him die. Permanently. Is it one of those things where it passes off down the line, or is this rakshasa going to be pissed at both of them? I believe it's immune to certain magics, correct? Speaking of those friends. You said these rakshasas are master manipulators. Is there a group or an organization here that has it out for us? In the meantime, I guess it's time to drink. I still feel like we need to reach out to Vanessa. Let her know what's going on. Cost of the contract? Good point. Did it meet us? He could be following us for a while. Veekar. Veekar. So the only one that's missing in action is the one that I shoved out the window? Well, there was one that was shoved out a window, so hopefully he died. I heard that, Grog. Like a surrender flag? There you go. Hobo bindle. Your heart? Oh. Keyleth has been in the door frame, watching all this happen. I'm in the door frame. Or we could just drink. We know who the fucker was. We know who he's going back to. To Spireling Veekar. We know where he's headed. Galdrick. A little hair of the dog? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Which we could do. You never know. (laughs) Yeah. I've got time. Oh, yeah. I'm sure. Fucking blow-outs every morning. (cracks up) I'll join Pike. Oh no! Was it the crab cakes? Really? The crab cakes messed with me a little. What did you try on him, Pike? I go up to Vax. Does he still have the brooch on? I look at it. Is this the skull I gave you? You cast it? Wow. That's impressive. Sorry. Ooh. Allura, what did you try? Kima, did you try Restoration? I've got Greater Restoration learned. Pike and I will tag-team a Greater Restoration. Did Pike and I notice anything when we ripped out this darkness from his chest? Like, by the rakshasa, probably? Hey, Percy! Hey, Percy, you find anything? Find anything, Percy? Oh. Maybe you should keep looking. Do a litmus test. Is it basic or acid? We don't know. Ooh! Oh, we just found a loophole! It needs to go to a bartending class. I light up my hands in defense. Is he still alive? No, we didn't. Fuck yeah. Glass sphere? You found a magic 8-ball! It's a scry - what? LIAM AND Oh, yeah. Sure. Can it be used by anybody? It works like scrying. But you're so important, Pike. We tend to need you a lot. Yeah. I have the other one, currently. Okay. Well, at least it's not as far as Vasselheim. Yes. Beefing up the twins. I go up to Pike. Before we take off? Before I take us in? Okay. Plan at dawn? (laughs) We plan to leave at dawn. Yeah. 900, 930. We plan ahead. Okay, I'm going to take a walk with Pike. Yeah, whatever. We take a nice stroll around the Sun Tree. I don't know, really, how to start this conversation. (sighs) I guess I just wanted to talk to you, and maybe you can give a little bit of insight and help clear my head. And I didn't think about it until we were in Scanlan's spa the other day, and you said you were really confused, and I'm really confused, and I didn't know you were confused because I feel like if I knew you were confused, then I wouldn't feel so bad about being confused because we're confused together. Do you? I do, too! The world is so big. (sighs) Right. The world's really big. Very confusing. LAURA AND I guess I just - I've always respected you and looked up to you, and... you're a cleric of Sarenrae, but you still seem to be very much in control of your life and your destiny, and you seem to know where you're going. (boxes fall offscreen) I've always loved, "My cabbages!" Anyway, Sorry, it was distract - loud noises. (laughs) I guess that's probably all of us. I guess I just - I'm a little curious on how your relationship with Sarenrae works, because it doesn't necessarily seem like she... is in control of you. Or has dominion over you. Does her own thing? Yeah. How do you mean? Like more... Involved? Yeah. Would you say you haven't fully given yourself to Sarenrae? Growing up in the Ashari tribe, we were taught that the gods mind their own business and we mind our own. I don't have any disrespect for them, but also want to... tread lightly. Okay. I don't know. I guess I don't know what I really wanted to find. I guess misery loves company. It feels better knowing I'm not the only one confused. I confuse you? Hugs. Well. I'm beginning to get the idea that we're going to be intermingling with gods a little bit more, so. I guess it's something I'm going to have to start getting comfortable with. (embarrassed) Oh! (weakly) Uh-huh? I'm so terrified. (sighs) I think that's my fear. (weak laughter) I haven't had fun in a long time. I should. You're always with us, wherever we go. (sighs) I love you. (shouting) Assassin! Haa - sure. I might have screamed in his face. Assassin, yeah. Okay, yeah. What do you want? You want some limes? Some grapefruit? You love a good lime? I'll go to him and get some limes. Yeah, sure, yeah! Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm going to go to the kid. It's like one of those traveling food carts? You've got to track them on social media to see where he's going to be? About this time, I take the limes and I go, "(shouting) Hey, Pike! Look! Fun!" As I juggle them. (laughs) Fuck you, Percy, you're not here! It landed on a - (laughs) What is it, just a straight dex? Acrobatics? 10! (forced laughter) This is fun! I'll just keep going. Sorry! (laughing) "Or whatever." (laughs) Worse. 8. I'm trying, Pike! (crying) I'm having so much fun! (crying) Huh? Such a long walk! (chanting) Go, go, go! You and the names. I reach over and I grab the chicken that I'm sure is on the table, and I say, "Vex, pull!" (weakly) Sorry! (stuttering) I take my fire hands and I blacken it and make it like a nice shish kebab. Just a little - I'm getting the dirt off of it. I'm getting the hair off of it. There's a little hair on it. I'm not a cook. It's arcane fire. What do you want from me? Keyleth just hollers, "Vax! Come sit by me." (yelling) Shut the fuck up, Vex! That's it. Whitestone Atlas Obscura. Keyleth picks up two chickens, burns them with her hands, and chucks them at the guys. Lady spas?! Bye, Pike. Thank you, Gilmore. Yeah, yeah. Any last words of wisdom for the Feywild? Thank you. I think that was it. All right. Oh. Oh. (whispering) Hush, Percy. All form a circle and hold hands. All right, everyone. Close your eyes. No. Just close your eyes. It helps - If it makes you feel better, Scanlan. Close your eyes. It helps with the nausea. And - SAM, MARISHA, AND My pretty! We're going to Disney! Harry Potter Land! I'm going to go to the one place I know, which is the portal just beyond where Grog entered. But I know that there's a portal there, right? Grog's girlfriend. No, but I've got a vague idea. Can I talk to - hang on, wait. Remember your girlfriend in the Feywild? Think about her and that place very, very hard. Going there. Think about Grog's girlfriend. We don't know. Yeah, everyone's been tweeting at me, asking "where did you get your awesome shirt?" Uh, LOOT CRATE, what. Oh my god, that's amazing! That's amazing! (singing) It's a Pike in a box, ooh. Oh, god!
