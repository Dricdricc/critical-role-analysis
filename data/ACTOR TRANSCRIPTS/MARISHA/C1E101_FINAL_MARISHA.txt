Still in front of a green screen. The art is looking so good! Great Lakes Avengers Jeff Lewis. We announced it on Tuesday on Talks. Yeah, Jeff Lewis, still Jeff. That was so existential of you, Vex. Wow. That was a really meaty spell she had. I've never seen that before. Recycling. And both seem to suck magic in, correct? It's too tight a room? Is there an underground water source near Whitestone? We could try and flood it with acid. While they rummage, Keyleth wants to test the radius. Technically, I can flip gravity. I don't know. I felt like I should put it on the table. No, that's not what I meant. I just wanted to be honest. Well, it hasn't been relevant yet. We could theoretically forge more of these, right? Or do you think they're blessed? Yeah, are they magical, Tary? Are these magical? Outside of the field. Well, that kind of clues us in on a lot, actually. I was trying to test the radius of this sphere, too. Am I still doing that? Is that still relevant? Wow! That's a long way. It's the same as the other one? Okay. Yeah! Sure! You guys have fun collapsing. If it falls on you, we can fish you out. Just survive a little bit. Badger. Badgers burrow, right? Do badgers burrow? But I rolled so shitty on that nature check before, right? We should make little Pike backpacks. Just her but with, like, a jockey on a horse. (straining) Those gnomish thighs. You could hold me in your hands. I've got about 30 seconds. Just to fly up? Can I ride side-saddle with you? Okay! Your abs are nice, Vex! Have you been working out over the past year? Wow. I lean over, I Druidcraft a pebble, toss it in the hole. Yeah! All right! Can I be like, all right! I want to see if I can do this, like, cool maneuver. I'm going to try to balance on the broom, and then jump off the broom and go Keyteor and go into the-- Nah! It's like Whac-A-Mole! All right. I'm going to Earth Glide to the bottom and then peek my earthy face out of the top, see if I can see down. Yeah. I'll try to be conscious to make sure I don't hit anything that looks precarious. All right! Looking for traps! That's okay, 15. Just a drop-through? Can I, like-- fuck. I found, like a, it might be a roof or-- What? Piranhas? I don't know if piranhas are in rocks, but there might be something else in there. There might be piranhas. Oh, I'll avoid it. There's a ladder, man, there's some very innovative people. Yeah, these are very innovative cultists. Yeah! Hey, Pike and Grog, you guys did an excellent job. ASHLEY and Okay! Good idea! (unintelligible grumbling) I try and say, like, well, I know it's about 180 feet because I tested before, so I'm trying to be conscious of it. And then I back up a little bit, and I go over to where that tunnel was, and I start collapsing it down. As I work my way up, I'm going (impacts). It's like a platformer. Half of my level, or something like that? Or it's a third of my level? Still several hours. (guttural noise of agreement) (laughter) (guttural gibberish) I speak a different language that I still don't think anyone has-- I don't know. We've gone back and forth on it! Not that different from my normal speech. This looks like it's rotten from the landscape. It looks like it's all gone bad. Has it gone bad? 25. Does it have a name? A what? Vafall? It makes a really good salve. It's good for sunburns. Yeah, I can do that. Through the tree. I pick a blossom from the tree on the way out. Where's Allura? Can Keyleth go talk to Percy? Keyleth waits for Percy. Hang on. I can go talk with Cassandra, as well. How did that go? Yeah. You think? I hate being sick. Anger at least drives you towards something. Fair point. I have a crazy thought, and I needed to run by you. Sorry, didn't mean to hit you. Okay. I'm excited. All right. We watched the orb change. She changed the magic in the orb, right? We just spent a year making magical orbs that change in some way, that are all linked to our city. Clearly, not as powerful as what this is. But what if-- I don't know. What if she corrupted something that was already there that wasn't supposed to be corrupted? What if she can corrupt more things, like our crisis orbs? I had this immediate fear that what if I built something that was supposed to help-- Well, you helped me build it. Am I crazy for thinking it? Am I totally off base? Maybe there's something in our own technology, in our own magic, that can help inform us. I don't know. All right. We'll sleep on it. And those symbols. The necklaces. Druids, we use similar things when we plane shift to other worlds. I think I can plane shift us there with it if we don't want to go through the orb. I think. It seems like very similar technology. Magic. Yeah. I don't know. Sleep on it. I'm going to go think. The crisis orb room? Actually, I'll go with him. Oh, that's good! Take it. Bitch! Sorry. Go on. I'm looking. I'll meet you in the library. This is a tiny Hercules Mulligan. I was looking for him! He's been in here the whole time. Yeah, and I call Vex there as well. A fuckton of old notes. Vex. Okay. Oh my gosh. Oh. Okay. Oh, praise Sarenrae, there's so much going on. Okay. Remember how Whitestone used to be all dead and awful? Very similar to how the other Ziggurat was dead? And then they called the ziggurat the seat of Pelor, right? So what if it was already there? What if she's taking doorways and dimensions and corrupting them and bastardizing them and-- What was he locking away? The Chain Oblivion? Okay, well, that's a big deal. And Delilah came from Wildmount? You did a bunch of research on Vecna. He used to be a man, right? TALIESIN AND I mean, it sounds a lot like what Delilah is going for. What if she is Vecna? Yeah. Dread Pirate Roberts of the Vecna. She came from Wildmount, where Vecna originated. She came here for research. Maybe she's just finishing what he started. And wasn't she doing a bunch of research for runes and tomes? Do we have the research that the Briarwoods-- Didn't we seize a bunch of their research? Do any of those ley lines go through where we were in Marquet? I wonder if each ziggurat is over a nexus. They were also trying to build that whole bridge situation? Remember the bridge? That was weird. They wanted to move an army. Right? Okay. If you were run out of somewhere-- Which you have been. After a lot of research-- -- and you were trying to do something-- -- what would be your second place of choosing to go? I'm just saying, if you're run out of one place for doing something, I imagine-- Yes, I do. If they are run out of one place for something, my first thing would be try to find the next place to keep it going. Correct. What if she's already been killed in Wildmount? So many theories, you guys. So many theories! It's kind of exciting. We know the Briarwoods also did dealings with the Stormwinds in Wildmount. Son of a bitch! Did we see a pyramid when we were in Wildmount? When we went there? And that was up in Vasselheim! Thank you. There's a ziggurat on every continent! (singing) Every continent has a ziggurat. It's these damn ley lines. I knew there's been something up with these ley lines and I tried to talk to the Sun Tree about it and he didn't know. He's a tree. No, he's very cool. And one of the things I have written down. In your room, praying? Yeah. Desmond (mumbles). Briarwood's carriage driver. Lady Briarwood is immune to daylight. Briarwoods have an army. I have it in giant, big letters, but I don't know what that means. I could also maybe Plane Shift us there with one of these? Is it worth going back to any of the other ziggurats, or no? That's true. If we jump through the sphere of death, they might be expecting us on the other side of the sphere of death. If we Plane Shift, we might be able to come up with a flanky, secret, other tactic. I'll talk it over with other magic-users, first. I don't know. I'll find one. Eskil knows stuff like that. He dislikes you even less. He just hates everyone. Oh my gosh. We figured out so much stuff. Delilah might be Vecna, and all this, there are ziggurats everywhere, and we're so dumb because we've probably seen several ziggurats, and they're all on these massive ley lines, and I give him a whole dialogue. What do you mean? You think if we go in, we're never coming back? You think if we go in, you're never coming back? I'll have someone send a message. You can't resign to this. You can't give up on me. I can see it in your eyes. You think this is it. Really? Everything going on right now, and you're worried about my dad? Typical boyfriend, I guess. That's fair. Promise me you'll come back with me, no matter what. Even if it doesn't happen, just promise. I just need you to believe it. Sure. Go find Eskil. Good morning. Lovely weather today, isn't it? So! How's the research on the Shadowfell going? All of it. All of the research? Anything we should know? Anything important? Fill us in a little bit? Spark Notes? Used to transport souls? Give me a second. Okay. I'm going to show him the necklace that we found. This seems to have a slight magical attunement to the Shadowfell. Do you think I could use this as a plane-shifting device? All right. That's very good to know. With how much time? Okay. Are you able to send messages? You have Sending, yeah? Just wondering if you could tell my dad that I might be gone for a long time? I'd really owe you one, Eskil. Just a quick message? Just to my dad to let him know that I might die attempting to-- Korren of the Ashari, who is one of the headmasters. Thank you. Can we maybe borrow your research notes on the Shadowfell? Is that a thing? No? (sighs) Thank you. Thank you. Sure. You know where to find us. What? All right. Enjoy your tea and biscuits. Thanks, Eskil. Apiece, or total? A lot to unpack here. 30 Rock Soul? (giggles) Unless we want to go through the old-fashioned way like the cultists did. We might take a little bit of damage on the way through. It's definitely a large amount of risk-taking already. Scanlan's back. Hang on. Do we want to do a Heroes' Feast? Do we need to put on the robes, too, that we found? All right. Do you want the robes? Keyleth reaches for Vax right as he goes in. Oh shit. Oh Jesus, that's so many dice. He twitched again. Just that? That's it? All right. Yeah, in. 16. And the ziggurat is above us? 27. They love holding hands? While they were looking at weapons racks and doing stuff like that-- While they were doing that, I pull Vax aside. I grab him-- Goddamn it. Scanlan's back. Listen, you can't die, and I don't know what's going on in your head, or what you're thinking, but I feel like it's not good. Has the Raven Queen spoken to you at all? Recently? Down here? I need you with us. Not with her. I need you with us, and with me. So let me do this. And I'm going to burn my 9th-level spell and cast Foresight on Vax. Don't fuck it up, man. It's my 9th-level spell. We look so cool. Does this city look like Whitestone? How many are there, three? Yeah, let the twins go ahead first. I can Grasping Vine one into the building, right into Grog's hands. And I go (whoosh) and Grasping Vine him, and throw him right into Grog's hands. Fail. Do you have Regenerate with you? The last war on what? That tower? No necklace? Travel through?
