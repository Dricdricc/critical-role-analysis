I'm so excited for you! I'm so fangirly. We have the best fans. Yes. Shout out to our New York and San Fran. San Francisco. Both coasts. But we're into it. Imaginary rolls. (laughs) Yeah. We freaked out our Uber driver. I feel like we need to find and screen cap in the thread where we were like, 20, 30 people, guys. Let's not get our hopes up. (whispers) Yeah. Hundreds of screaming children. Screaming, yeah. You're in Minecraft, right? Story mode. Yeah. Do it! It's metagaming, you can't. We're not allowed. Yeah, no. Tonight. So soon! Which one? Not good. Always cocked! Still not great. It's like-- Barbarian, man! That's hot. Ten. Hey, Percy gonna do what Percy gonna do. We're in a death trap. And we're-- Yeah. Yeah. (all laugh) Yep, accurate. Unless you're in Japan. No one has any resistance, spell resistance? Forgetting-- Your armor? I've got a spell you're-- (as Matt) So that sucks, but-- It's a bonus action, so we can do other shit if Scanlan and I both do it. Smells like burnt fur. Did we lose-- (laughs) Yeah. Okay. I'm right next to Trinket, right? Okay, right? Where is Trinket? I'm going to go ahead and go to Trinket. He'll be fine. He'll be fine. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and do a Cure Wounds spell on him. I'll just do first level. No no no no no. I'll give him a-- shut up, Scanlan. (all laugh) I instantly felt guilty, dick. Yeah, you did. Okay. (laughs) That's 2d8 plus ten. All right, that's pretty good. That's an eight and a seven plus ten. So-- MATT and 25. And then, as a bonus action-- Can I, looking at whatever the shit this is, pull out my spark stone-- --that I got from my Fire Ashari. And (shattering sound). Yeah, I don't know what it does. Ow! We'll find out. And I go Minxie. And I brought the hood. (all laugh) Hell, yeah. I look like an Ed Hardy tattoo. (all laugh) Well, I moved to Trinket. Oh, yeah. I'll start heading to try and flank him. To flank the blue beastie. You do you, Scanlan. Oh. Balls. Does a bite attack-- 26. Human shield. It works. I can picture that. Why did you do that? Yeah. (all laugh) I'm going to do my Bite and Claw attacks. Yeah, I'm going to move in that crux a little bit more, one more, if I can? Beautiful. I'm going to do my claw attacks first. To see what they-- what it does. It was cocked. So that's 12, plus, it's always different. Okay, 20. I haven't been Minxie in battle for a while, 1d10 plus five. Yeah, six, so 11 damage for the claws. Plus 1d6, oh wait that's actually-- What did I just say? I said ten, 11? And then an extra 1d6? Ooh, another four, so what did I say? Then I'm going to do my bite attack. 16, so plus-- 20, plus my six, plus seven, so 24. Which is 2d6. Eight plus five, so 12. 13, 14! Plus, I get an extra damage for my collar, so 14. (growls) Yeah. (growls) Whoa! A turn. It's the eyes! Sexy dance. (laughs) It just starts going. Pew, pew. No, you didn't misfire, did you? That's fun. That little chunky thing? I don't like the dice that I have. Have you seen anything like it? You stared at that for a really long time. So. 16. Who, me and Grog? Okay. Dexterity saves? That's not good. Four. Looking-- I'm out. I'm now in Keyleth form. Not that many, thank God. 12. That felt like Shockwave. Grog? Grog? Speaking of jelly, I would like to go ahead and do a nature check to see if I can salvage some goods from whatever. I rolled a 21 to collect goods. B-E-H-I-R. Sure. I'd like that. Natural 20! Here, Grog, bag of holding. Just terrible. The glands? Glands? 18 is not bad. I'll take that 18 for a 28. Hey, Vax, can I see your dagger? Maybe, yes. (electricity noises) Percy? Do you know how much longer we need to continue on this path? Can we see how far ahead-- does it look like it goes on for a while, this chasm? You can't leave! (all laugh) He does that a lot. It might be more mirrors. An army with mirrors. That's fun. It's a start. Dragonborn? You're not picking up Tiberius six miles away? Western side of the mountains? Shut up! Pass Without a Trace. I could create a diversion. I mean, I could-- What's nearby? Is anything nearby? Any animals? Have we seen any wildlife? I happen to have Hallucinatory Terrain right now. It means exactly what it sounds like. I can make terrain that's not real. It could block their view of us. I mean, I can do a lot of things, I can make a thunderstorm, I can make a sleet storm. I could. I could, I could make a big storm. An athletics check? I don't know if I have climbing-- 11. Thanks, Grog. Bears are good climbers. Yeah. I love that he says 'roll your dice' like it matters. 19. I can bird it. I can bird it and go in. Bird in and do a recon mission real quick? I'm a bird. I'll go bat! Not in a small-- They have echo vision! (laughs) Very reasonable eyesight. Yeah. Bats come out during the day! Oh yeah! 28. (squawks) That's my echovision. How big is this room? Does it look like it goes deeper? Like a downgrade. I'm gonna go into that-- (all laugh) Fear of god. I'm going to go into the room that I see is for sure empty, and go toward the threshold of the ramp. Like it's been ransacked, or just a really nasty fight? Like something came in and slaughtered and completely stripped the place. Can I tell if the blood looks-- how dusty is this shit? How much dust goes pff? (squawking and coughing noise) Investigation. What about a 12? All right, I'm gonna go ahead and-- are there any other rooms, or is this it? You said seven stories, so it's like room, downgrade, room, downgrade, room? Is there another room going off the bottom room? Nice flat, upper east side. Land, and I'm gonna bamf out of my bat form, and say, all right, it looks like the coast is clear if you guys want to check this place out. How dark is it? Does it look like it's magic-y? I can try, I'm not as good as he is, but I'll try. Ooh, 20! No, 18; 20 total. It's definitely magical. What did you find, what did you find? Grog, Grog, those might be centurion birds! They might be spies! They might be spies. Inside! Wait, wait, wait. Oh, oh, but before the crows leave, before the crows leave-- Can I do something? I'm gonna go like Storm and I'm gonna Sleet Storm them. I'm gonna start conjuring a Sleet Storm over the top of this mountain, right where the crows are. Oh, jeez. I know, they're like frozen though, right? Don't they get frozen with Sleet Storm? Knocks them prone They're in the sky, I wanna hear birds hit the floor. I think so. Yeah, but we don't know-- So over here? Does this graveyard have catacombs? Tombs? Underground passages? Yes. (laughs) Stop. We should do a fly-by. Do you want to do that? Distant howling? Does it sound like wolves? Can I make a nature check? 26. Would I think it's weird that they're howling during the daytime? Odd. How long would it take me to fly over if I was a bird? You could ride me into town. Man, every time, Scanlan, every time. You wanna go invisible and jump on my back and I can eagle up? Let's do it. For half of my druid level, we discovered. He's got an earpiece. I wonder if that's the ground search party. We want to keep our good rolls. I'm looking at it! (choking noises) Can I also make a perception check? With my eagle vision? 14, so that's 24. And I have Keen Sight, which means I have advantage on all perception checks. I'll take that 14. As opposed to that one. 24. You want to talk to people? Does it look like there's a central part where there's a lot of people gathered? The town square's emptying out? All right. I'm going to swoop down and find a tree, where the five or six farmers are, and perch, see if Scanlan can get a good-- It's just open and empty. A rooftop? A wall? Anything I can perch on? I perch on the wall. I'll keep an-- Oh, wait, I can't see you. Maybe whistle for me when you come back. I can come get you. Can I see him? That's awesome! It's a taser arrow. I drop my Beast Shape, holding onto a branch. Yeah. Yeah. I Druidcraft some spiderweb hammocks. And, as usual, light some sage. Maybe take a rope and tie it. Whoa, Vax. Nice helmet. Don Quixote called. He wants his bowl back. They all appear to be fairly miserable people. They did reference Sir Kerrion by name. Oh, they referenced Sir Kerrion, Percy. Also, there was something other really important. The town was pretty much empty. And that Sun Tree, that what's-his-name-- Who said that? Jarett? Desmond. Looks like there were some executions that took place. There were about eight bodies hanging from that tree. I don't know. Why do they call it the Sun Tree? Can we call Pike through your magic poo? Yeah, I can, actually. Find allies in the town? That's what I'm thinking. Yes, they're terrified, but this whole town's being ruled by fear. You killed Percy. And then what happens after that? I know. I feel that's the equivalent of putting dish soap in the fountain on prom night. Yeah, we did that. What? Oh, wow! Here's another issue. It's going to take me a minute to do the tree. It might take a bit. Well, I mean, it's one of those things where the longer I do it the better it'll be. I can do it for up to eight hours. If I do it for up to eight hours, I enrich the land over half a mile radius, centered on a single point, and the land becomes enriched for a solid year. Yeah? I think if I have a solid hour or two hours with it. Oh. Well, dope! Would I know stuff like that too, then? Right. We're free. Totally. Here's my question. I feel Pike's energy tonight. Maybe, while I'm meditating, I can somehow reach out to her, and maybe ask her to get in touch with Sarenrae, and maybe Sarenrae can call up her homeboy Pelor. I don't know. We're not organized religion people, we Ashari. Hang on! What did you just say? That thing you just said that no one heard because we were all shouting and arguing? Rally the townsfolk? You want to build a militia? It's like Attack on Titan. That's cool! I like having the people. It feels less like we're the United States. A burn on yourself? Like a brand. What? Yeah, something hearty. Wait. Wait. Which plan are we doing first? Okay. Yes, but the Briarwoods knew who you were. The Briarwoods recognized you instantly. What time is it? Have we gone to sleep, or are we waking up? Are we doing the tree thing right now? Okay. Well, that's what I was going to say. Do we want to find operations, try and recoup-- If we take a day to get in and get settled, I can do a Heroes' Feast and then I start crack of dawn in the morning? All right. That's dope. Can we each take a little bit of time to look more like commoners? Yeah, we do look like quite the motley crew. Still a failure. Oh, yeah! Seeming us? As opposed to the cows? Come on. A donkey. A mule. A Clydesdale! Make him look like a milk cow. They want it to be really dark. As opposed to all of the other things we've done? As opposed to sleeping in the Underdark? Can I do some sort of a check from a distance to see if I can recognize what kind of tree it is? 18. Magical grower. Okay. Right. Don't get emotional. So the way the spell works, I can do it one of two ways. I can do it instantaneously, essentially grow up a whole bunch of plants and brush and shrubbery around me, or I can wait and I can concentrate for a while and instill a plant with vibrant-- -- life energy and heal the farmlands and it would stretch out for a really far radius. I'm gonna probably wanna do more the second one. I don't know, it's a central point. Look like it's no big deal. 14. Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It looks like us. It's us! Do they look like us or were they just dressed like us? Are they made to look like us? Yeah. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Question. You said there were eight bodies? Is there one that looks like a gnome cleric and one that looks like a dragonborn sorcerer? But, it does mean that it was because of when they saw us in Emon-- -- because Tiberius wasn't here with the crows. It was because of Emon. So, can we get like a vague idea of how long these people look like they might have been here? (whispers) Fuck, I'm not good at this shit. Oh, that, you know, that wasn't bad. Woo! I'll take that 19, 21? Why would they put a warning for us here in the city? Does it look like there's a covering nearby, roughly, 30 feet or so from the tree? I kind of want to talk to the tree. Does anyone want to come talk to a tree with me? All right, all right. All right, all right, all right, I'm coming, I'm coming. The saddest brothel! Ooh! Can I get an eye as to how far away it is? Hmm? I got an idea. Actually, what are we up to right now? Are we doing anything? Are we busy? Oh, there's a cellar? I mean, I can burrow us a tunnel right now. I'm going to do it right now. I'm going to cast Move Earth. To the direction of the tree. And I want to be careful, I don't want to damage the roots of the tree at all. So, as I start getting closer, I want to start looking for the roots of the tree. You could always slap it up there and shoot it with a flame arrow. How's my burrowing going? 200 feet. Awesome. I'm going to clear out a little more area, and I'm going to touch the roots and cast Speak with Plants. Shut up. (kid's voice) The sun is so bright today! Hey, he's cool sometimes. Sometimes. That's what fish say. I can bring it back. Should I? I'm a druid, that's my-- yeah man! Yeah, it's called Plant Growth! Yeah! Should I? Okay. But it's dead. What time is it now? Should I start it up now? I'm going to start my Plant Growth. I'm going to drop. Can I try to clear out an area where I can-- I should be fine. I'm going to strap on my gloves. Hope you guys are ready for this. No, it's just going to take a long time. Actually, before I do that, can we all have one last meal together and eat a Heroes' Feast? How many did I buy? It gets used. It's expensive. It's $1000. How much gold do we have? Three bowls. I take some of that leftover wine, use that to make it fancy wine. So you get, I believe, 2d12 additional hit points on top of your maximum hit points. For 24 hours. Oh, I'm sorry, 2d10. And, you should have- Ooh! I got two tens! We have two more bowls. Doing that right now, just in case the Briarwoods decide to come say hello. So, we're immune to poison-- I'm going to go meditate. I'll be back in eight hours. What time is it? Well, I'm meditating now. I dropped into my meditation-- Hopefully nothing happens and y'all don't have to defend me while I'm doing this shit. That's what I'm hoping for. A tree full of dead us? That's fucked up. Double-dipping. Yeah, that's Dugganator. Steven Duggan? Yeah. Fellow critter! Alec! Go next to the DM! Yeah. Yeah.
