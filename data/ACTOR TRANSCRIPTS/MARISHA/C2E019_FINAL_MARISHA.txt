There is no air hole; that's so irresponsible. Why do you show your tricks? Yeah, and we already signed one contract with him. There's a fight club! You guys, it's a fucking fight club! The one we got the information from. Louis and Thed? Wait, who was Louis? Oh yeah, that's right. The ones that we hazed. The Gentlemen's guys that we talked to before we went to go kill the will-o'-wisps. What? Why would you? That was awesome. Okay! What are the rules? Okay! What does that mean? Do I get to roll twice? Okay. I did. 17. All right, 17. What! I thought we were having funsies! That hits. Let's wrestle! Okay! Mace in your face! Yeah! Holy fuck balls! The fuck, Jester?! Boom! Boom! Boom! I'm going to do some Ip man like (punching noises). Like all the way down her spine. Right in the fucking ribs. Yeah, going for that. Okay the first one definitely hits with a 20. The second one is a 15. Okay, and then I'm going to spend a ki to do stunning strike. Okay, wait, hang on. As in one ki-- Do I have to-- Hang on. Sorry! Roll damage and then do I do? Not great damage. Seven damage. Can I have another attack action because of haste? And I still have my bonus action? Because my stunning strike didn't use my bonus action, right? Okay. That's not great. That misses. It was a natural four. Oh right! She's stunned! That's a natural one. You keep your shield in your ass? Ow! Then I have one more bonus action, right? Okay, that's good. That's 19 to hit. Six! Right in that sciatic nerve! Right in there. I'm going to just do-- Once again take my staff out and I'm going to gut strike her right in the stomach. The first attack, that's a natural 18. Let's see if-- Okay, no. I'll take that 18. That first strike is 12 damage with my staff. Then I'm supposed to state flurry of blows as my bonus, right? But I get one more attack and then I can do flurry of blows. Second attack. Okay. 18. This is still my regular attacks. I'm going to do a six damage crack just right in her gut, knock the wind out of her. And I'm going to do flurry of blows. Motherfucker. Okay, first one. 14. Second one. No, even worse, natural four. And I have one more attack action, right? Mm-hmm. 14, 20 total. Another 12 damage. Oh shit! It was pretty good, though. Fight club! Sorry Jester. Oh wait, I thought you were going to Fjord. I'm sorry. Oh shit. So awesome! Dude, what did you do? That was crazy. Well, I got a little blood lusty after that. I'm so sorry. I don't really know. Do I know that he cast Haste on me? Would I be aware of that? I don't know. Maybe it was a relapse of the those mushrooms that Molly and I did. I don't know. It's really great. I don't know. I feel really good about myself right now. (groans) Oh god. We're going to take a nap after this, right? Ah fuck. I take my canteen and clean Jester up and trying to help her out. Now that the adrenaline's wearing off, I'm feeling a little guilty. Yeah. MATT and Fucking Louis. Yeah, where's Horris? I just drooled a little. Oh god. Super endearing with that black eye. You know what contraband means, right? Okay. Oh, yeah. I agree. We've already-- yeah. How awesome does that place sound? Yeah. After, yeah. Yeah, I don't like contracts. We already gave our blood to this guy. Exactly. Yeah. Seems like the Empire has enough money to just throw at problems. I don't think that's going to change. Yeah. They've got a wax museum. Largest ball of twine. The Branson of Wildemount, yeah. I hope it is! Yeah, that's it. Like into it. There's a map for that. You have a printout? I don't have a printout. And where are we? Oh is it this the Zubenda Swamp? Is that what it is? Northeast of what? A trek. We'll have to go here, come back, and then go again. Also, if we're going to go through Berleben anyway, we might as well check in on Horris. To make sure he's, like, alive? Not tell anyone. Schr√∂dinger's Horris? All right. Yeah, that's true. I hate guilt. Yeah. So we're going to take them all? Hop on both of his offers, I think? Let's do it! The exhaustion point lasts until you take a long rest. For the Haste? Oh! Once it wears off you're like-- Okay. I'm nursing a short rest. We'll be all right. That's cool. I wrote them down. Didn't you buy a fuckton of paper and ink? You've used it all? I join Caleb, because I went pee last time when you guys went to go to Pumat's. Ah, shit there are four more! All right. Super fast. A little birdy told me there might be bracers here? Bracers? Oh. I don't partake in the use of armor. Uh-huh. How much? Holy shit, Pumat! The fuck?! I'll come back when I'm fucking rich, aight? All right. Holy shit, Pumats. I don't have fucking 1200 gold. How do you have 1200 gold? I'm always in an existential crisis. I'm going to go now. Stamp punch. Ten visits. We go. Very quickly. Bolt over to the cart. Did you fucking slip something into my drink, Caleb? What the fuck, man? Oh. Dude, that shit was awesome. Yeah, I was into it. All right. Who is good to be lookout while the others? Jester said she's riding in the cart. I'll take Loaf. Oh god! What did you keep as pets? You didn't have any pets? Oh. Making biscuits! We ruin everything Matt creates. Okay. I put on the goggles. What did you roll, a one and a two? Can I go ahead and light a torch, see if I can start a fire? Gather some wood? Not great, ten. That's true, park the cart next to the fire. I'll take second watch as well. (laughter) How's your perception? I have plus three. No, she's advantaging me. Don't fuck me, Gil, and 14. Want to huddle together for body warmth? Yeah, no, I'm good. No, my robe is good. It's thin, but it's high thread count. It's very good. In terms of? How long since you left Xhorhas? Did you grow up there? That's a better question, take that one. You appreciate grass? Wow, yeah? Uh-huh. What was your favorite part about Zadash? Xhorhas? Is it that bad? Do you still have that "This is home" connection with it though? No? That's nice. I hope to see it someday. You can see your breath (exhales). I think so. (laughter) That was just an impression. Wait, she's like Luigi? (as Luigi) It's a-crazy! You're a little dewy, and you don't know why? That's definitely a little shitty. I think I still have some pocket bacon. You want some? Yeah, here you go. Yeah. It's just chimney smoke. Just keep moving. Campfire smoke? It's not a billowing column. Weird people live in shacks in the woods. A really cool hour? Let's make camp before we completely lose light this time. I'll help. You rolled the same, well, almost the same. Wait, but I'm helping him. Plus? But you said advantage? Oh, right. I'm going to make a fire again. Ow. (whispered) Jester! Shh! What was that? The break? Okay. That felt like the end for some reason. No cliffhanger! Oh my god! So I was thinking (grunts) Oh, that's sexy. And stay tuned because during the break, we're going to play the first episode of Key Question, because it's Deadpool related, and Deadpool's tomorrow. It's an edited version because it's a long episode but you get a sample. Okay bye. Here we go! TRAVIS and Natural 20! 24! A natural 20 on the most useless category. Not a useless category, but in terms of a Nat 20, meh. But exciting! I don't want to shit on it! I'm not cursing! Oh Jesus. Oh boy. Where am I? I wake up and I go Fight Club! I run towards whatever I see first. Do I see the wolf? Do I see the goblins? Beau, in her hazy boss phase, goes Ogres are the leaders. And she runs straight for the ogre. I'm going to unleash a round of attacks. Two attacks. The first attack is a ten? No, and the second attack also misses. Those are both my attack actions. I'm going to use a ki point to go into Patient Defense at that point because that sucked. I yawn and then go into a stance. I turn back to Jester and I go Jester! Puppies! Patient Defense. That's some southern shit. Get the molasses out your ass! Uh-huh. Okay, miss. 13, correct? Did they say carve face? Car face! It's All Dogs Go to Heaven, you guys! Oh boy, roll high. Oh! Whoa, that was sexy! You guys, we need formations! We need code words! Laura, committing to RP! Yes! (through clenched teeth) Stop it, stop! Do I get a hit? He ran by me! Okay. (disappointed) Okay. 12? As part of the Sentinel feat-- Hey-oh, 12 damage! Yes, I rolled an eight. 18 and a 17? It hits. Hang on, one, two, three-- Oh god, hang on. You know what, I'll come back to that. A strength saving throw. Okay! Thank you, Gil. 19. Bad dog! I'm going to unleash on this ogre in front of me. I have the ogre and the wolf, right? I'll do my first two attacks on the ogre. Natural 18 on the first one, and the second one sucks at a four, with a ten total? Okay. Goddamn it, six damage. I'll go ahead and do a Flurry of Blows for my bonus. Yeah, let's unleash into the ogre. Okay, 19? And 14? Okay, ten damage on the first, eight on the second. It goes really well with the wings. That's fucking big. Oh, thank you. Whoa, miss. Firewood! That was so badass, though! Oh no! (laughter) Your identity! Dude, you look dope. I just want to say. You're fucking hot! Let's go! She's going to fucking kill this motherfucker. I thought she was going to take him out, too. Okay, I'm going towards this fucking ogre. I'm going to do a pole vault situation. Lift myself up, and then come down with a big ol' slap. First strike. Okay! 20 total for the first one. Okay, that's not good, five damage. Second one, I'm on his shoulders and I'm coming down, that's another 20 total. Fucking-- okay, nine damage. Hit his ribs? Okay! Hearing Jester, I'm going to do Flurry of Blows, which I wasn't going to do, but hearing Jester, I'm going to because I felt so fucking inspired. I'm going to, leaning off of the ogre, do like a (pop pop pop pop) into his ribs. Okay. Yes, I did. First one is 19, second one is 13. Okay! Fucking want to (mumbling). Die! Okay, first one is a seven, second one is a six. (yelling) Ah, damn it! As I'm punching, I'm going Die! Die! Yeah. Is that a Xhorhasian thing? They're speaking a language. Oh god, what are they talking about? Oh, such FOMO. (laughter) I think he's hitting on her. I can't tell, but-- Yeah, maybe she's angry. He seems passive, I don't know. Nott, did you recognize any of those goblins? Nott, do you share the same hatred in yourself? You seem to hate your kind quite a lot. I don't know. Yeah, we can. Yeah, hey. What was his name? Where would he go? Nott, there are bad people everywhere. Doesn't mean you have to associate yourself with them. Yeah, you're one of us now. And aren't we great? I'm trying real hard to not make it super scary. I think we're all a little bit of an island of misfits. Nott the Brave. You earned your comma. What got you locked up with this guy? Cherry wine's real good though. I've counted. You've said "not"like five times, in a circumstance that's not your name. It's super inspiring in a weird way. It's all like super relevant. Just throwing it out there. Yeah. I don't know if I can sleep. I'll take the next watch. Boulders, parchment, shears for first watch. Just live here.
