Tomorrow, Fridays. Who goes up next? You're a celebrity! What? Yeah. You're like the most interesting man in the world. It's fantastic. 80. I took damage, I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault. I lost concentration. Blame the dragon that did 40 damage. Wait, not yet. Stone! Stone! You've got a ride. Animal handling. I'm going to drop and I'll start focusing on the Gatestone. One minute, baby. Khaleesi! Where am I in my minute? Shitty G.I. Joes. They're both falling, yeah. Vax will hit the ground first. I'm hoping you can hold on for a minute. But who's on the lowest hit points? Do you still have Polymorph? Fuck. So cute! I'm technically an earth elemental still. You know, it was a good idea when he was still in the dragon. 200 feet? That's all right. Well, what's below me? I would hit zero hit points as an earth elemental and go back to Keyleth. Right, but 200 feet. That's survivable. Yeah. It's roughly 60 points, and I've got 67 left as this earth elemental. Hang on, wait. Wait, wait. If I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it right. I'm going to ball up like a cannonball and light up my hands, that I keep forgetting because I didn't know I could do them in elemental form, by the way. Thought it was only beast form. I'm going to light myself on fire and go meteor. I was trying to leave an impression. No pun intended. I drop, and I stand up, Keyleth, in the middle of a giant crater. Yeah, that's me. Sounds kind of fun. Are any of them still alive? It's funny, we almost just died fighting the dragon. How ironic. I'm actually great. I'm just in a smoldering meteor and look like a badass. How much longer is he going to be tiny? I just have such a hard time taking you seriously right now. I'm so sorry. So, Shale, did you and your scouting party find out any additional information that might be handy? What she said. All right. A lot of them. We hope. I could use a short rest. We're trying to catch the dragon while he's still debilitated, right? We don't know what he has access to. Reserves. What do you mean? I can get us there via trees. I need to know a tree that's there. I could Scry, look for the closest tree, teleport us there, but by the time I'm getting there, I'm exhausted. If I Scry. I mean, I guess I can look around and take a guess. Yeah. So I can teleport us closer and then walk, or we can take a very short rest so I can get my beast shaping back, and then could fly a few more of us. It's a gamble. Wait, what? What was that, Shale? Is that true? Just let him believe it. Oh, yeah, sure. So are we resting? How long would the hike up the mountain be? An hour? So we couldn't do round trips anyway. They'd dissipate. Well, yeah. We rest and then go. If we rest for 30 minutes, and then I switch and then we have the eagles, then we can get up in another 30 minutes, and then it's an hour. Theoretically, short resting is our shortest. I do. But then we'd still have to hike. How long would the hike be? I'm tapping myself-- I can do it, but I'm tapping myself out. I'm burning literally all my top level spells and I have no beast shapes left. But I can do it. It's what we think is most important. Can I rest? Can I rest while the first round goes? It's for you guys! Yeah, we're good. Yeah. I want to rock back and forth in a corner. I can try and scry inside the cavern. Get a battle perspective? All right. You have to give me a few minutes. Is everyone all right with that? Natural 20. Hey! I take a little of the soot, and I give myself some druid battle make-up. I'm about to. Pretentious asshole. Yeah. My staff doesn't have a name. It's so true. All right. I scry. I focus really hard on the dragon. Yeah. Sure! Can I have some of the-- I scrape a little stomach bile-- Wait. He's going to sense what I can scry, can't he? Maybe I can just try and scry inside the lair? I mean, he knows we're coming, yeah? Yeah. Actually, can I do that? Like it's a camera drone? Sure. I want to try and focus on Umbrasyl's whereabouts, but I want to see if I can get a nice bird's-eye view of inside the cavern. 19. Ah! (laughter) No, but I heard him. He sounds very rough, or possibly sleeping? I don't know, there was a lot of heavy breathing. Very deep-- not, you know, shallow breathing. Not impassioned breathing, Scanlan. He could I guess still be invisible. Also the cave was covered in acid pools and dark and dingy and everything else we would expect. I know. I don't think he caught my presence. I don't think he's necessarily expecting us. We can have the element of surprise, here. I cast Protection from Acid on Grog, again. Shale, you seem almost like you're-- As I was saying, you seem like you're almost expecting to die, or you're looking forward to it? All right. Just checking that we wouldn't disappoint you if you don't die. Shale, what type of magic do you wield, exactly? Okay. Very clear. So remember, acid pools everywhere. Do we have any type of cohesive plan, or just-- I do have Faerie Fire. You combine the two things that you said and it's fantastic. Wait! Who's climbing where? 19. I love rocks! Okay. What's happening? Where am I? Oh right! You're so tiny right now. I keep forgetting that. Do you want me to put you in a little pouch? Could be like a kangaroo? I think like, seven. Pretty sure my arcana-- It's seven. Scanlan, it's a very pretty rock-- Pike, these are very attractive rocks. What does it look like? No. What does it look like? Is it like a slate? I can alter their shape. I can melt, I can do something with them. What do you mean, they're not real? Hang on. We might be able to circumvent it. Right? Can we go around it? Is there room on either side of them? How about this? I'm going to cast Stoneshape, and can I carve out a little path around one of them, on the edge? Carve a little recess? Rocks! I can do it two more times. All the way into the cavern. Oh, shitballs! Whoa! Percy! He rolled a natural 20! 17. Natural 20. He did Insect Plague. 14. Whoa! What's up? Oh, it's something my grandma would say. So good. If I move through Insect Plague, will I take damage? Or is it if I end in it? That's true. You waltzed through it. And you didn't start in it, did you? Oh. But you took the damage up top, you didn't take damage again after you got out of it. All right. I want to see if I can move. I'm having a hard time seeing, Matt. Can I get my full movement of 30 feet into this corner here? Yeah. Oh really, I can parkour it? Yeah! 14. Oh, okay. I think the dragon is roughly here? I'm really sorry, Grog. I'm going to cast Faerie Fire, roughly-- Yeah, somewhere where I think he is. Means you don't have acid resistance anymore. It's a concentration spell. But none of us can see him, yeah. And with my bonus action-- He's going to do his thing, isn't he? Great. Fuck you, asshole! Okay. But it's gone! They're gone. What a dick. I know. I don't think I'm going to go into my beast shape form so I can do another spell next turn. Can I just tuck and see if I could take a bonus action to hide in this little nook and cranny here? Because I'm not a rogue? Can I hug that pillar and say, (panting)? As long as you get out of it. Enough to negate the disadvantage? That's a thing that can happen. All right. Oh, thank god! No, Chris, no. Monstah! Kill him! LIAM, TALIESIN, and Okay. Faerie Fire (poof) right in front of me. Right on top of him. It gives everybody advantage on attacks against him. I hope he's got enough hit points to make it worth it. Yeah, take it, bitch! Glitter bomb! It's like a Kesha music video. You're so pretty! I'm going to use my bonus action to turn into a water elemental. Yeah. That's how I roll. TRAVIS and Can I move? Am I in his range of attack? Honestly, Umbrasyl is so fucking big, I can't see what's going on in front of me. Is Scanlan in front of me? Can I step in the front and shield Scanlan? What about anybody else? Okay. I'm next to Shale as well, right? We're all in the shit together? Oh, Shale's over there. You know what, I'm just going to stay there! Kill it. Fucking kill it! Disco dragon! We also have Heroes' Feast up, by the way, if that makes any amount of difference. Kill it! Advantage! All day! Advantage all day! Big money, no whammies. That's good! Sorry, excitement. He's bad at it most of the time. Because he's a fighter, he gets three attacks per round. It's like a John Wu film. (burbling) Come on, bitch. Come on. Totally fine. I'm an elemental for a reason. Halved. Yeah, it has damage resistance against acid, bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from non-magical weapons. What did you say? Not bad, not bad. Hang on, sorry. Just my straight modifier, it's not a save? Okay, 18! Whoa, daddy. All right. Half the damage I receive, so yeah, I'm good. I'm golden. So it wouldn't give us disadvantage, it would just be straight rolls? Come on. Come on, Scanlan. Consult the helix. Down, bitch, down! Without advantage, even though he's retreating? Even though he's retreating in Faerie Fire? That doesn't double it? Okay. Letting you do this! Be thankful of what you have! 22 exactly. Shit. Balls. Low. Shit. Eight damage from the elemental. And we decided I don't get my fire hands when I'm a water elemental? Yeah, all right. Here it comes. 12. DC 23! Did he get out of the darkness? Ooh, ouch, not good at all. What am I making, just a constitution check? I don't think it's going to be enough. Eight. Shit. Fuck yes. Awesome. I'm into this. Percy needs it. I'm up? No shit. Wow. Okay. It's really far away though now, yeah? Way more than 30 feet, right? What is he? How far away is he from me? Yeah. You're holding your action for someone to get up close. Oh, you already did it. Yeah, I guess I'm going to dash and see if I can get to him. 30 feet. I guess so. You witnessed it! You're a third party, it's good. No, it failed. Breath recharged. Fuck. It's like a 23 save, right? But it doesn't matter. Six. Kill him, motherfucker! Kill him! This fucker's got to be close to death, right? I drop my water elemental form. Nice. Holy shit, Grog! Keyleth drops elemental form and goes over to Vax and grabs him by the face. I tap him on the face, and say So glad you're not dead. And I walk away. Keyleth walks over and pulls out her Hunk of Quall. I'm going to Quall it up all over top of the gold, see if anything lights up with my Wi-Fi detector. Since that's what I feel like it is. We have to go back and get Fassbender. There were still a few members of the Herd still alive. A good half dozen. Yeah, exactly. Did we contribute any of our own gold into this pile? Let's divvy it up. Is he still tiny? He's still tiny. We need Fassbender. Yes. 100 percent. I start going to town on it. Yeah. Percy, do you have any extra vials? Empty vials for blood? Hey, Percy! So glad you're alive and not burning in acid. Do you have any extra vials? I'll take that 16 for a 27. Nature check, yeah? 27. I want to harvest some scales, some blood, and some teeth. Plus he had three in his Bag of Holding. I hand the three vials of blood to Vex to put in the Bag of Colding. We should make some sweet necklaces. Any scales? All right. I'll spend as much time then, I'll stay up as long as I can throughout the night. If I hear any disturbances I'll come back to the mansion. Such a dick. We didn't die!
