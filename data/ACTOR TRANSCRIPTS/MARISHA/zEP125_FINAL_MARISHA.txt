Yes! Oh, that's cool! He did it! Nothing. Taliesin, didn't you say you ran into a Critter who went and started to do D&D? I love that. So thank you. TRAVIS and If he can do it, you can too! So cute! It could have been so many things. Big money? Jewels? And you're sure he's a god? Yeah. I'm really interested in a god that kicks it with people. TRAVIS and I've never heard of that. Maybe Molly can do a seance and he'll come out! Does he talk back? We were in Alfield because that was also when I stole the mail. Room party! Why not? You could also get a new jacket and new pants. How long could it take you to memorize pockets on a coat? That's like 20 minutes. You could really just get a new coat. She does see hamster unicorns. Are they gods? So we're not having this room party? You also have to get in in order to rent the room. Caleb, why are you so hung up on just changing clothes for, like, ten minutes, just to get through the door? I'm just saying, you want in, dress for what you want. Well, why don't we at least go and talk to that guard that came back? Try and track him down, maybe get a little bit of insight. Do we know where that guy is? Oh, or was there a guy that came back? I mean, it will be dark after that. Oh yeah, let's drink and fight. That's a good idea. Let's maybe stock up on some torches on the way there. Nah, we don't need torches, do we? Not anymore. Yeah. I have one in my adventurer's kit. Yeah. Copy. Two sponge rollers. All right. Oh, good! They came to us. What? All right, here's what we're doing. We got this whole writ thing from the Lawmaster. We're going to go down, kill the monster that's been tormenting you guys. Heard you lost a few guards. Heard any rumors? Do you know anything, before we go down there and maybe die? Uh-huh. Come on, man. I'm not-- why-- Did I ever ask you to come with us? I just asked for rumors, man. Don't put words in my mouth! Open the-- What did you hear? Stop with the nervous tics. Stop. I know that. That's still not information on the monster. Is there a way to navigate the sewer systems? Any markings we should look out for? Nothing about what kind of monster it is? No darkness? Tentacles? Big teeth? Can I do a look around to see if there are any types of street marking for the sewers? Natural 18. 22, I believe. 22. So one, two, three type of a thing. What about the arrow to the left? This arrow splits into three arrows and then-- and it's a penis. Right, yeah. Also, there's got to be an A and B around here. All right, I guess there are more options this way or down deeper. I mean, it is a sewer system. Or it could just be the main drainage out of the city. All right. I wrote down blockage, webbing, and nest. How big are those slide marks, Yasha? Four inches? There are people eating at home right now. The water seems to be moving towards the direction we're going? Go back the other way. That's true, the middle is the safest. I'll take the front with Yasha, I'm assuming. Putting my goggles on. Poop-mist! (squeaking) I take a ball bearing-- I'm going to take a ball bearing and ping it. It's a hairball. It's like resin. It's reality seeping into our game a little bit. I know! It's so Baldur's Gate. I love it. 19. (chanting) Level three! Nine! Not fun. (groaning) Natural one. Oh sorry. Hang on, I'm taking damage. One, two, three-- apply damage. I'm going to take this one that is in between, closest to me and Yasha, and I'm going to do a big ol' golf swing with my quarterstaff. Not that dice, you were mean to me. Ooh, that's good! 22 to hit. Oh no, that's a four. I thought that was a one for a second. Eight damage. Interesting. I still have my other attack, yeah? Can I move in and kick that guy? Yeah, that one. I'm going to rat kick. Rat kick. Natural 20! Come on, give me that big ol' four-- That's a one! Six damage. I reach over to Yasha and I go-- Punch it. Miss. Oh no, I got it! God! Aw, too helpful. You're being too helpful! It rolled a natural one again! Laura, put it in jail. (whimpering) I know. Okay. I'm all right. I'm only down five hit points. Can I bend down and, covering with my vest a little bit, see if I can search and figure out exactly what these things are made out of? Guys, I think these are undead rats. Zombie rats?! It's the egg sack. You're totally right. That's true. It doesn't appear to be human-sized. That one does not. Would it move the webbing as it went through? I agree with Fjord. I think we we start poking around, that thing's going to come running. Oh, no, that was Caleb who was freaked out by fire. Yeah. Yeah, probably. Let's burn it. I guess I'll go with team Caleb/Yasha. I'm trying to split up evenly! You still have your torch, yeah? Do they have a dog tag? What?! Okay. You stay there with the halfling. I might be able to negotiate my way a little further. Oh, jeez Louise. I'm going to also move forward next to Caleb. I've got dope goggles, though. Natural 20. I think these goggles are like polarized. It's real cool. He's got a thick band of tattoos, sorry. Of the halfling? Do they look old or like a fresher tattoo? I did roll a natural 20. They're not fresh. Do I see puncture wounds? Okay. Halfling! Why are we invisible? Oh. Oh goddamn it, he has it this whole time. I'm sorry. Then ten to 15. I'm 13. Does anyone know where the lollipop is? The spider is in between Fjord and Beau. How many? Do you want to go first? Is there a way I can hop over the web situation? It was bothering me this whole time, too! I meant to fix it in the break. Can I jump this gap where Molly is and avoid the webbing? Natural 20. So I have 25 more feet? How close can I get to the spider? Fuck! I don't have any reach with my stick. I will hold. I will take a dodge action. You've got this. No! Okay. Where's it going to go, I'm going to-- I'm going to split the difference and go here. I'm not, I'm going there, because I still want to be able to get to it. I'm going to hold a Flurry of-- Can I hold a ki point action? Or can I hold an attack? Or can I hold an attack and then decide I want it to be a flurry of blows? Can I take the bonus attack now, to do the ki point and hold it? Okay. This is balls, y'all. I'll hold until I see it to make an attack. I know. (electric guitar sounds) You didn't have that, did you? You couldn't do that type of shit. Damn it. Ugh. Can I close the gap? With my 40 foot movement? MATT and Can I-- Like I'm trying to get spiders out of the corner ceiling with a broomstick! Exactly. Of course I do! I'm going to do the full-- I'm like, wasp, get the wasp! Disadvantage. I got it! I did! I rolled a 15 and a 17! So that's 21! Better call an exterminator! 11. Do I have room to still get one more swat? Probably not. Okay. Yeah, I guess so. I turn around and go, don't worry guys, I got it. Good ol' broomstick trick. Works every time. I'll still stick with Jester, though. Just in case he's-- What were you doing down here? Insight check. 18. Tapping into my background a little bit, I'm going to go You know, I used to utilize the sewers back in the day. Real good to stay out of sight. Move stuff quickly. What are you moving? Okay. Before we do that, what's your name, friend? Ted? Would I recognize that iconography or have heard of that? Does that mean anything? Oh, nope. That's a big nope. That's a natural one. Jester. What's in that leather case? Molly? Can you? No, but we're all of the same breed; we get what you're doing. Yeah. I'm sensing a lingering sibling rivalry. Hanging over the table. What's Thed doing? I'm going to do that lean up against the wall thing over the top of him. You real thankful? Real grateful? You feel like we did you a good service today? I just want one-- I just want something in return. You know, you provide a service, get something in return, right? Who's the Gentleman? Oh, friend. Oh friend, I don't need to roll an insight check to know that's bullshit. All right. Where do I inquire? The Evening Nip. All right. I'd like a drink-- No coin. What's your name? Anybody have any neck tattoos that look like serpents? No-- are-- go ahead. Beau turns to Nott. Hey girl. That little code you were talking. See any of that written around these walls, or something that looks similar to it? Can I help him out, see if I spot anything? Give him an assisted roll? Money pot? What, what? Yeah. I'll put a little bundle on my staff as well. I'm imagining the Play-doh fun factories. (shouting) Room party! We can't ask Siri here, we don't know. I mean, to be fair, we know how to get here through the sewers now, we can always come back. Make a beeline? Let's do it. We're the Mighty Nein. Yeah, you might want to send someone to collect your dead too, by the by. TRAVIS and Who the hell is Cloyde? Cloyde? Cloine. That is not what I heard at all. Send him back to bed? You should let that guy go for leave for medical absence, that's rough, man. No, he's got a fair point. I'll give him that. You know, yeah, it's fair. Oh, come on! Oh, it's not too bad. Yeah, you can buy it back for us or we can go pawn it, your choice. Well, unfortunately, it's property in her bag right now, and it's real tough to get out of that bag. Sorry, fair. Nice. Hell yeah! She's still a part of the crownsguard. She's still a part of the system. Yeah, they're nice individually sometimes, but they're still a part of a shitty whole. A real shithole. LAURA and It's been a long day. Look, I don't mean to have resting bitch face, okay? I'm working on it. That's cool. You're real quick. Oh honey, I know. (laughter) We got to shower. You know memory is different than being able to tell the time of day by the sun, right? Yeah, that's fine, but time of day. That's bananas. You should be able to look at the sun and say, "oh, six." Don't want to interrupt your "broment." I'm not here. I am not here. Oh, wait. Oh, Ulog! Not "lok"? He was the one who was super not-cool with us being there, super angry. Wife Illiana, into it! Yeah, man. No we did not. I consider being curious a pretty high skill set, but since you're asking beyond that. I'm pretty good with this here bo. Pretty good fighter. Named Beau. It's a little redundant, to be totally honest. It's kind of obnoxious. Sometimes it irritates me. Yeah. Can't pick them. (laughter) Indifference is a pretty strong sentiment. What makes you think that now is the right time for all of this? (shouting) Oh god, stubbed my toe! Thanks. I was trying to not show my emotions on my face. Yeah, thank you. I'm trying to get better at it. Yeah. What do you think? In my experience, it doesn't matter if he thinks he's fucking with the Empire or not. The Empire is going to look at it as fucking with them, and that never ends well. Last thing we want to do is take the fall for these assholes. And he's talking like he wants us to be the fist to his voice. What the fuck is that? Yeah. Yeah. 'Sup. We sampled. Are we in the tavern? Is anyone watching? He didn't tell us a lot of anything. Sorry, I didn't mean to-- He got kicked into another dimension! Oh, it's not funny. But who kicks a fucking cat? We'll beat his ass later. We'll beat his ass later. You know what we used to do as kids, we used to take fireflies and crush them and make glow jewelry. When they'd light up, and you'd crush them right as they light up, and then you can make glowing war paint. It's a thing that happens on the east coast. Yeah, it's a southern thing. But you paid for it! It's a posse! Well, maybe-- Don't let us hold you down, if you want to go enjoy? Being alone is sucky, right? Okay, no questions. Just scouting them out. Yeah yeah. Have we been here yet? They're bouncers, like rough bouncers at that bar. He's the bartender? We'll take a round of your house ale, if you don't mind. Clive. You been hit by any riots? I was about to say, why-- Hey, is green your favorite color or something? Thanks, man. Yeah, what do they look like? Yeah we did! This is a mob bar. Do you have any beers on tap? Oh no, just the two? Okay. Interesting. Feels like this is a front. Yeah. Maybe we finish our drink and move on for now. I pound it for her. Can someone fly us in some water for the DM? We learned so much today, you guys. Keep going. Feel like we were on a roll! Some lox and bagels! Where in Virginia?
