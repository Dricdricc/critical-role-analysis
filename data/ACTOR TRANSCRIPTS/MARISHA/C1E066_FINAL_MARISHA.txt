Yeah. It's always stylish. So wait, has this been an ongoing thing. Did this start last week and I missed it? I do. We have a new product that we're coming out with. We teamed up with our friends over at Espionage Cosmetics to come out with Critical Role nail wraps! We've got make-up now because that's how cool we are. Yes, and so there's some that are blue with our logo on them on silver. And then we have red ones that say "How do you want to do this?" And they glow in the dark. What? Yes, they do. And when you open the package, they're brought to you-- Yeah, I got this. I always rip them. But when you open it, they're from Gilmore's Glorious Goods. Yeah, brought to you Gilmore. Uh-huh. So yes, you can go get them right now. They are available tonight. LAURA and And we tried to make them like unisex because people like Taliesin like to rock the nail wraps. Oh, also there are Geek and Sundry nail wraps. Okay. What? All the shit. Live crit strong. It's always Tal. We knew what you meant. And we saw him and we met him, right? He was like "hello." Right. Hmm, I'd say it's mostly bad. Hmm, mostly bad. It seems as if this is an extermination. He appears to be their leader. Why wouldn't it be? Yes, I'm afraid we're not talking about a drake anymore, we're talking about an ancient, full-grown dragon. Well. It's sort of unofficially. You know, we didn't necessarily ask for this, it just fell in our lap. Yeah, that's true. Our keep came crashing down on around us and then we were committed. It's animatronic! The gnome is just in time. Oh yeah, where is Fassbender? Fassbender's with Wilhand. We just rolled initiative. He's like a big iron samurai. 12. Yeah, 12. Right. Are your bullets not magic? Is he made of metal? Or is he a big dude in a metal suit? (singing) She blinded me with science! Sorry, Steve! 17 total. Did you say 55? That just dropped me by half my hit points. Fuck you, Travis. He's right, we're not ready. We're stupid assholes, oh God! Wait, why was it higher? Did you do it at a higher level? Okay, okay. No, it's fine. I'm good. Dexterity save? 11. Does my spell resistance armor help with this? I've got advantage. Does my advantage from spell resistance on my armor help with this? So can I roll again? Oh, that's better! 21. Feels good. Yeah, I'm awake. So lightning radiated off of him? Go, Scanlan! Okay, seeing that the lightning is doing some damage, I am going to cast Call Lightning at fourth level. I'm going to take a step back first, actually. Just five feet, I want to shift back five feet. I can do that without getting a swipe, right? Aw, sick! I'll back it up a little bit more, there's good, no right there's fine, yeah. And I'm going to cast Call Lightning, fourth level. Right on his head! 19. 4d10 because I cast it at fourth level. Three, six, not great. Eight, so make that-- what's six plus eight? 14 plus five, 19 points of lightning damage. And with that, I'm going to use my free action to go earth elemental form. Yes. Did I sound like Mickey? Did that happen? Yeah, don't stand in front of a window. Obviously. Obvs. Yes. This is what I was going for, yeah. I am immune to poison. Because I'm a big earth elemental. That's right! Jesus fucking fuck. Fuck yes. Yes! Yeah. We're all on the same page. I'm so proud of us you guys. (singing) I don't want to wait for our lives to be over. Okay. Grog's sort of out of my way-- I want to full on linebacker style go for this guy, and we're going out the fucking window. And I'm going to take him, tackling him out the window. Yes, that is what I'm going to do. What am I doing? I'm an earth elemental, so is that just strength? Ten. Yeah, can I do it again? Yeah, let's try this again. Come on, big money-- ugh! No. Just no. I rolled seven total. Yeah. Don't say that! Are you grit farming right now? You're totally grit farming. Yes! Ank'Harel! Come on! Sorry! Sorry, Steve! I'm okay! Hey Grog! Chest bump! Huh! Yeah! Who? For chest bumping each other? 19. Out the window? It's a four-day Comic-Con badge. Updating? Goddamn it. James Kryon? Crystal Chateau-- what was that last bit? Got it. Sure. Crystal Chateau. LIAM and Two kittens worth. Oh, in the see-through elevator? New math. He's finding fractals and shit over here. He just created the Mandelbrots. Fight that vertigo, fight it! Yeah, I do a Gust cantrip overtop of us to keep from getting splattered. Shut up! Is it the opal dice again?! What the fuck?! A little therapeutic massages all the way around. Really? Between all of us. Oh, I rolled a ten! Oh wait, do I roll or you roll? We roll? Cool! I enjoy the gambling game. That's fun! Also, what exactly are you doing? We're so cool. TALIESIN and That's true. I feel like we need something that he could use in a sentence very easily. Does it have a shitty roller coaster attached? I really enjoy the gambling! Yes. But we are cool. We are chill. Look, it's a night out in Vegas, man. I Druidcraft a little frost on the edge of my armor. So that I'm cool. Guys, just tell me I look cool. For a little bit. It is a cantrip. I'm kind of badass now. Fuck yeah, it is! Or totally, I do, like a little, give her a little bit of concealer. A little bit of foundation, a little powder. Oh yeah. Yes. We are. Ren-sa-la quan? No, wait, what are they racing? I go over to there. They're doing their own thing? Okay. How far away am I from the lizards? Can I go up to them? Or are they behind a gate? Okay. I'm going to go up to the guy. Yes, be pleased. What are these magnificent creatures you're racing? No, I'm a tourist, so I'm brand new. Is it possible for me to get a closer look at the specimens you are racing? I'm a purveyor of fabulous beasts and I just want to see these fabulous creatures you're raising and racing. God damn it; this is not what I'm good at. Ten! How does 200 gold sound? What did you just say? Sorry, what was the third name that you said? Did you say Thordak? What a fascinating name. Where did that one come from? Oh, wow, yeah. No, I was just wondering if there was any correlation. Can I get a closer look at them? I would like to get a closer look at them before I decide on where to put my well-earned money. How close are the guys to me? While they're having this conversation, I'm going to lean into the lizards and cast Speak with Animals. Very under my breath. Here we go again! Oh no. Very discreetly. I'm very bad at funny. You talk to other people in our group for funny. Oh, don't, come on, man. Look-- You guys. I just got kicked out of a casino! I'm so cool! I'm cool, Scanlan, I'm cool! Guys, I'm a little soggy, but I'm so cool! Oh good, I didn't lose 200 gold. (giggles) Only for lizard racing. (whispers) What's it like outside? It's dark, and I'm in a shady alleyway, and I'm alone. It's great. Yeah, no, I guess so. But it's so pretty. Percy luck! She's good. Guys, get me a drink! If they have a Chardonnay? That works. A Shiraz would be phenomenal. How fast is your metabolism? The slushy margaritas. Oh shit! Casino fight! Let's all get thrown out! Yeah! Natural one buddies! Grog and Keyleth, on fire tonight! Grog! Hey buddy! Percy, get me the flashy cup! I want the one that's in the shape of the tower of Ord. Did you guys bring me a drink? (giggling) I love this city! What'd you guys get? What's it look like? I can try. Okay, but first I'm going to nature check it. 14. But it does seem plant-based? I take a little finger-dippie. It'd be great on a rack of lamb. Am I high? Saving throw? 19. I take a little bit in my hands and I light it with my flame hands to see what happens. I waft it a little bit. Why do you need revenge? You got the product you bought, right? Oh my god. It's the night of all the natural ones. I make a little bit of my glissfoil hangover tonic. Give it to him. No one even fucking wants it! We ask Treev first where is the Crystal Chateau? Don't use the opalite dice. Opalite hates us. Does it look like a similar excavation site to the ziggurat in Whitestone? Percy? Is there whitestone located outside of Whitestone? I Druidcraft a little gold star for him out of bark, and I say Here you go, Grog! Good job! You have a gold star for the day! Just stick it right on your forehead! Yes, is there a standby list we can get on? The world. Time is of the essence. (whispering) Tell him who you are, Percy! But you have heard of these Vestiges before? Have you heard of one called Cabal's Ruin? It's a cloak. Can I do an insight check on him? 19. We can always come back with more of this condensed whitestone in tow. Hopefully, take this as the fair warning that it was meant to be. So I have heard. One last note. You mentioned Cabal's Ruin? Have you heard of the Den of Druja? Really? What was the name of this sorcerer? Magician? Mage? Sure. But isn't knowledge like this best known so that history does not repeat itself? We don't do well with snobbery. All right, so, we know a little bit more. The Den of Druja was a guild. 60 years ago, though. That's quite a long time. What time is it right now? Maybe we should find out more about this Den of Druja. It sounds like there was quite a civil war that happened back in the day. He was definitely very interested in it. Well, mine's beast shape. Mine's natural. I'm au naturel. It's organically natural. Get caught. That's our hotel, Scanlan. The Hilton by the airport, not downtown. Hang on, we're just going to go knock and say what? Wow, they haven't even opened it? Assholes. Is it the spice? Are you having a rough morning from the spice? They could just have a basement. Do we have time to go get more slushy beverages? Did we forget to check for traps again? Wait, and it's dried? And tried to haul ass out. Can I look down the road, because I'm down a bit, see if anyone looks like they're coming this way? 18. Can I do a check on the outside threshold of the door to see if I can see the blood go outward? Nothing, no. Okay, we're all inside, right? Pike's not here. I want to see if they've turned the room. 21 as well, looking at the house. Is it dark down here? Is it safe for me to throw out a Daylight spell? I throw up a Daylight. I pull it out, and I hand it to Percy. I'm sorry. I guess our girl is back in our narrative. So hang on. Which hand is Ripley missing? Right hand? What hand print is on the trapdoor? Is it a left hand? She's been doing a lot of research, and she's been following our exploits. We know she's a huge fan of Percy. Get the word out about what? The leader of one of the largest criminal masterminds is now dead in the city. We have to find the murderer. What do we say? If it's a week, Ripley could be anywhere. Yeah, but she was able to hide that before. Hold onto those bullets. I might be able to track her down, because they belonged to her. He's actually right. Then you have a one in three chance of actually hitting. I suck with cops. I get thrown out everywhere I go. It's great. Thanks, Espionage! Thank you, nail wraps!
