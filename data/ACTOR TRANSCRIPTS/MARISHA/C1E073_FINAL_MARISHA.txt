Half Clarota! I am Doctor Anna Ripley, from Wildemount. This is very heavy. This is a bludgeoning weapon, it is not a piercing weapon. It is a bludgeoning weapon. Right hand to the Briarwoods. And uber Percy fangirl. That's me. Cheers. Actually, me and Travis are the only dead ones. No, it's the horror theme. Little chibi Leatherface! Little Leatherface. At least a d8. Oh yeah! Both the Signal Boost Halloween episodes are out. And Taliesin and I are in them. And you make a cameo in the latest episode. Yeah. Go watch for Halloween. It's like @brianwfoster. Yeah. You guys are going to love him. He is great. Oh! He put a ring on it! (cheering) I have that to look forward to in my later years. No. No. Although I might still have Travis Willingham as my flower girl. Doing the dust of tracelessness. No, I can go. Yeah, no. It's been eight hours, I've done my thing? Sorry. You have to get immune to it. He might be in Whitestone by now. They've been through so much. I'm coming, boo. We've only been gone for what? 24 hours? I'm going to go check and see if I can find Kash. She's the only one-- he's the only one there? I grab Kima by the wrist. Not right now, maybe? Oh no. No no no no no no. I still have my hands on Kima, right? I counter with a 6th-level Dispel Magic. Can I do that? Fuck. I don't want her to fucking cast any shit on Kima. It's probably a charm spell. Or a memory spell. No, I don't want to fucking wait-- Okay. And who all is going to be a part of this meeting? (groans) Keyleth grabs Vax as they wander off and pulls him behind the rest of the crowd. Let's go. Let's track Raishan. Let's track her. Let's just do it right now. Let's kill her. We can do it, she won't be expecting it. We can find her. But she's sick and she-- We can do it right now. When she's not armed. It's not about killing a dragon, it's about killing her. I just want this to be over. Okay. Okay. Okay. I understand. I feel like it's very telling when Grog has more patience than I. (sighs) Okay. I just don't want to wait so long that she gets the upper hand on us. The longer we wait, the more she learns about us. The more we're letting her in, the more we're revealing. I feel like the longer we wait, the closer is her inevitable betrayal. Okay. Let's catch up with the others. Yeah, but what is this about? (sighs) (laughs) Look, it's 2016. Now you know why. Yeah, I set off. To find Kashaw with Vex. (knocks) Kash? I hope you're not naked! I don't know. Wow. No, I know. No, I mean I don't-- Just don't worry about it. (laughter) You're going to throw a rock at him? We can't just poke him? That seems so weird, though. Why don't we just tap on his shoulder? Oh, that's what I want to do. That we did that? Sure. I'll stand on the outside and look unsuspecting. Oh Kash, oh hi. Fancy meeting you here. Shit. I keep doing that. Hi. Yeah, I hope we didn't-- I hope you weren't sleeping. Mm-hmm. Yeah, wouldn't that be crazy if he was already dead? Kash. Kash. Look-- Not overlooked. We should probably go. You know, we could-- Okay. Okay. We'll see you later. What? Okay. Kash? Like right now? Did I miss something? What? Percy? (squeals) That's good, right? No! Why are you asking me? He's not my twin brother. I still worry if you care. Yeah, you say that. Oh, sorry, sorry, that happens a lot. I'm very happy for you. Okay, let's go to the treasury. We should go victory shopping. Yeah. I mean it's basically our money, though, right? Yeah. Okay. You know, Vex, I feel like you might be a bad or good influence on me. I'm not sure, but I like it. Okay. Yeah. They are like 50% of-- Stellar RP. So much dick talk! Is this how they talk themselves up? Second floor? Asum? That'll do. All right. Before we walk in, I grab Grog. How do you do it? You're able to utilize your rage when necessary. How do you keep it suppressed when it's not needed? Please enlighten me, Professor Grog. Promise? Deal. Ow! Ow, Grog! Grog! No, it's fine. I appreciate it. It's good. Oh man, people are going to ask questions about that later. Sure. Yeah. Okay. I don't want to let you guys down. Thanks, Grog. Okay. (clears throat) Let's do this. Is there anyone sitting next to Raishan? I sit next to Raishan. Yeah, I move closer to Raishan. I give a nod back. I pull out the Spire of Conflux and hand it to her. We retrieved this in our spoils. You may recognize it as one of the Vestiges that we spoke of earlier. Yes, I thought I was handing it to Allura. (laughter) Yes. Sure. Exactly. We don't want to deal with two ancient dragons. Allura, do you still feel a connection with the soul stone that's inside of Thordak? You built it. You must know of some way to disable it. Yeah. What? The soul stone has been broken and abused before. I have a feeling there's someone who might have an idea on how to disable it. Well, Raishan was the one who busted out Thordak in the first place, out of the Fire Plane. So I would assume that Raishan has some idea on how to-- Well, I have a lot of feelings about Raishan. Everyone who we ask, everyone who we send in there, we're sending in to their death. I keep thinking back to Emon where we watched half of our friends die in a second. It's true. (sneezes) Sorry. Yeah. Sorry. So you don't think he actually even fully separated from the plane, he brought the plane with him. Maybe then we're looking at this the wrong way. Maybe we go at this through the Fire Plane. Maybe there's something still there. Yeah. We've got an easy door in. And we don't even know where to look. I mean, we could at least talk to the Ashari there. They might-- It's huge, but not many people know the whereabouts. There's still locations and destinations within the Fire Plane. It's navigable. Yeah, they're very busy though. Let's fucking do this shit! Let's do it! Let's do it! (yelling) Yeah! Amazing! I'm into it. I'm really into it. It was so short-lived. I have so many guns in my belt! No one can even see them, and I'm still committed. Or an insatiably powerful enemy. Why don't you inform the room on how you utilized an entire race of people to break the ritual? You bitch. And you kept the soul and the stone inside of him? No. You used me. You used us. And my fear that I had originally appears to be true. A lot of this is my fault. I'm willing to accept my onus. The fact that you can't shows all the kind of person that you are. My promise still stands. I'm thinking it might come sooner rather than later. I understand that without your aid, none of this would have fucking happened in the first place. So it seems all of us can accept our part in this matter, except for you. What would you do if you actually got what you want? I pull out the Spire of Conflux. There are always many solutions to many problems. You think Thordak is the only solution to yours? This staff was birthed from the head of Melora, the same goddess who gave you that curse. What if you wanted me instead? Me and this staff. Maybe I can help you more than Thordak can. I'm saying I might be your best chance at salvation. I'm pretty sure this staff is the closest living relic that we have in existence to the god who granted your curse. Thordak is no god. That was your first stupid mistake. It's up to you, Raishan. Clearly you are the type of person who looks for answers in other people. You are clearly unaware of accepting any fault or any result of your actions. Why don't you start fresh? Do you really want Thordak to have another sway over you? Another gift, another favor, that he's given you? That he is going to hold over you for all of eternity? Do you really want that? You're stronger than that. Are we? Oh no, Raishan. We don't need your help. Let me say that right now. This all depends on what you want out of the end of the deal. Spoiler alert we're saying no to that. She's taken way too much. She doesn't get to leave! I say we take a recess. Gather our thoughts. Raishan, my offer still stands. If you want to come and find me, I know you know how. Maybe we can commune with Melora together. Can you guide his fury in a way that would be beneficial to the plan? You were saying ideally, if we could get him away? And Raishan rats us out. Would certainly put you in the good graces of the Cinder King. And you never come back? He'd be forced to be the one to have to leave the battlefield. You're a clever girl. I'm sure you can make a ruse to make you look convincingly dead. And we can all assume that when we exit this room, that our tenuous alliance is still that. Correct? Yeah, that's kind of true. Can I do an insight check? Does she know if Asum is up to something no good? 25, I think? Better double check that. 25. And we didn't know until 48 hours ago? Tops? We were forced. I have ideas. Just actually kill her? Oh. Did they have like a clean-up crew down there? Yes. She's definitely not as strong as the others, but far more clever. It's what she wants. We can't break the stone. They mentioned moving the stone that shouldn't have been able to have been moved. Correct? They moved it inside of Thordak, and then Thordak left with the stone in him, right? Right. So how did they do it? Because I'm also looking at another thing that is supposedly immovable. LAURA, MARISHA, and Kind of, yeah. That's what I was-- There's got to be a way to move it. It could be the only thing that could break the stone! What did you just say? What? Say it again, one more time? How big is it? How big is it, roughly? Perimeter. Damn, this place is really big. And it's encased in stone, yeah? Kind of, right? Were we encased in whitestone? Right? Tell me! Oh yeah, they die and they go right back to their plane. Are you trying to make me feel better about any of this? The Dawn Martyr. Dawn Martyr? I mean, only if we-- Also, we might be able to find some information on the stone. We could go in with the rest of the Fire Ashari that are there. We can meet up with Cerkonos. Is this whole ziggurat encased in whitestone? What? Okay, I actually do have Conjure Woodland Beings. No, woodland beings can be like fey creatures. Mm-hmm. Okay. Third level. Sorry, fourth level. What makes sense? I'll summon a-- A little-- (stutters) A little pixie. A lillul lillul pixie. What? Sure. And I send her in. Yeah. I have them. Can't they cast like Confusion or something like that? Or can they cast--? Hey! Try and Polymorph me! Nothing? Oh, I know Sylvan. I know Sylvan. Hey! How do you feel? Queasy? Yeah? Hmm. Hey, will you do me a favor and don't hold it against me? Will you go touch that black orb? Yeah! Yeah. You got this. Hmm. So as we expected, yeah. I don't think she's coming back, yeah. Like a spell. Oh man. Have you been in contact? Have you attempted to scry, or do a Locate Object spell on anything that you've thrown in? Probably? It's really frustrating. I feel like we have all the pieces here. I just can't figure it out. I'm really obsessed on this ziggurat thing. Have you thrown any whitestone into the ziggurat? Which is why it's frustrating, because I feel like we can beat her to the fucking punch. You already know how I feel. We basically don't have a plan. We're going somewhere until we come up with a plan in the meantime. Jesus. Let's put all of our eggs in one basket. You don't feel like we are stepping into every trap that Raishan has laid? Kill Raishan first! It doesn't matter! We just need her to believe that I can cure her disease. I could try. That's what I was trying to bait her into. We are sending everyone we know into one centralized location. Do we really feel like that's a good idea? Is it? We didn't talk about throwing everyone we loved into the frying pan. That was not the trap. I'm down for the cause of the war. Just not when it's a stupid fucking plan! We don't have a plan! We're just asking everyone to meet in one location. And then doing what with them? And then doing what? They're just going to be sitting there! They're going to be sitting ducks! I've accepted that people are going to die. I've accepted that. I do not condone sending people to their slaughter when we don't have a goddamn plan. I don't think that it's smart to put every potential ally we know in one spot. Can we not divide it up? Can we not find places nearby? But we also know that Raishan knows everything that we're going to do. I don't trust that she doesn't know anything. I'm going to assume that she knows everything. Bring it! She's on edge, all right? Look at what we did with Ripley. We walked into every trap she set for us blindly. We got cocky. We got bold. We fell for all of that. We could all be dead. I honestly don't know. Let's go check out Fort Daxio. TRAVIS and I can scry. I can scry there regardless and find a tree, yes. This non-plan. Bidet. (laughter) We're finishing it now? Sorry, guys. Those YouTube videos of social experiments? Just send out Matt. I was going to say, sorry for being a pain in the ass. It takes a lot for me to sacrifice all my people when a fourth of us have already been sacrificed. New at Sundance! Yeah, go knock on strangers' doors and get candy from them. Totally inflated.
