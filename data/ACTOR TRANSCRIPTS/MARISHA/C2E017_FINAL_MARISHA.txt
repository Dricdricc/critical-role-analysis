Another honey heist! More bears are back in town. Nice. That was a lot. Lots of bar brawls to start. Yeah. Well, that was kind of cool. I do as of right now with you telling me. Do you feel all right? Like how much more powerful? Punch me. I want to tell. I'm like, come on. Holy shit, Jester! What the fuck? Ow! Okay, that's awesome. Yes! I move and do a little hip bump. Get out of the way. Just a little hip action, I've been working on it. Hey, Jester. That was you who said something when you were talking to the Xhorhasian assassin about babies not being born, or something like that? I think you were like, "Oh no, the babies!" Something about babies. You know how that town crier was talking about kids being stolen? You think they're connected? Thanks. I wanted to run it by you. You have a good memory. I know there's a garrison out there. Oh, it doesn't count as using your memory if you're reading it, Jester. Come on! That's not fair. I heard a rumor last night that more are getting through. I don't know. All possibilities, yeah. No! I'm naked! I'm not naked. Nott, have you never been to a festival? Yeah. Wait, what's she look like? Did you say something? I bet that's her. Oh, that's right. I got so distracted by you. You can carry booze in the streets here, right? It's like Vegas? Open carry? How was the new lady? Was she nice, was she a bitch? I bet she's a bitch. I don't know. Because I want to buy this place, so I don't want to like her. Maybe we can use that to run her out! That's a good point. Do you call a cherry pit a dead cherry? What do you mean? Is Trebuchet like a trebuchet? Aww, I thought they were going to throw her. Again, again! Fjord can't throw. I want to find the most ridiculous mead out there. Mead. 17. Yeah, do you have mead that doesn't taste like piss? That'll do. What's your highest proof mead? Still smells like piss, man. Strong. Barbarian pee, but it's good. Oh, meat sounds great too. I'm the booker, so you pay me. (laughter) I'm just standing there like, what? Maybe they'll let you use it. Nott, I really want that wooden sword. Don't listen to Fjord. Nott. If you get that sword, I'll give you my jade bracelet. It damages your hair. See, the beads have a little bit of like, gold embossing, etching inside of them. Oh, thanks! Look, guys. I'm Molly. Look! I want to go over to the military booth. Yeah, what's up? Cool. Who's the strongest? If you win, do you have to stick around and arm wrestle a whole bunch of people because you're suddenly the best? I don't want to dedicate more time to this. Do I still get to be the best though if this guy sticks around and just keeps going? Is this really that important to you guys? Yeah. For a gold a day? Buying people's loyalty for a gold a day? Sorry, I just-- all right. (sighs) Heard something about a Victory Pit. Is this the Victory Pit? Yeah, sure. Beau. Person Beau. Nice to meet you. What is it? Leopold Sydney? Wang stacker. All right. (laughter) I'm going to fail this miserably. Good to meet you, Kendall. Ugh, it's sweaty. Oh, god. Oh, god, just-- Just a check? Five. A critter gave me this. They said it was lucky. It's not that lucky. 12. Ow! Ah. I'm very slippery, I'm not-- I want to do that Victory Pit thing, though. Okay. Yeah, you're stronger than me, right? Oh, I never heard that one before. Give him the chair! Hey Yasha, check it out, I got one too. It's a really shitty prize, though. No. Oh, what dicks! It says-- It's propaganda. Oh. I mean, if you're only training, they send you to the frontline and it's questionable. We're Yasha's booker. It's like her agency. All six of you fight? Is it the Gauntlet? Yeah, I know, what is it? We need coins, yeah. Which we awkwardly go in the same direction. It's like when you say bye and then "Oh, are we--? Okay, we wait 30 seconds. One, two--" If you saw random mimes? New robes, too. Cobalt's a good color on you. You look good in blue. Hey, what do you think that dude meant when he said it wasn't like a normal fight? Maybe it's an obstacle course, you know, Ninja Warrior style. Maybe we all sit around and talk about our feelings. Ooh, styling! Yeah, makes us feel very worldly. Poor Stan. Yeah, that seems standard. Wait, how did you get four? Beauregard. (sighs) His name is Caleb and Beauregard, I want that clear and on the record. It's Caleb and Beauregard. Mm-hmm. Yeah, just sprays them! Can you give her some blessing-type of situation? You're going full Solid Snake here? Caleb, is there anything about this letter? I don't know, I'm paranoid right now. It's just the scroll from the-- I don't know, ignore what I just said. Jester, high-five. As we walk off, I hold Caleb and walk behind a little bit. What did you hear at the Cobalt Soul? You were trying to get into the Cobalt Soul, right? You replicated robes from the Cobalt Soul, right? That's what you were going for. Yeah, that was a nice little error on your part. You got real close. I can tell that you were trying to get the dyes. You know, the gradients. Did you hear anything? I'll get you into the library if you want. I pull back my belt a little bit and show him the rest of the script written out on the back of my belt from the Cobalt Reserve. On my trainer's belt on the back. No, it's on my belt. Fancy embroidery on the inside of my belt. Yeah. Don't look at me like that! You can look at me, just don't look at me like that! You're not going to look at me now, are you? Okay. It's fine. You know what, we'll talk about it tomorrow. (whispers) Don't let him tell you what to do! Is she her own team? Mortal Kombat! I want to be him. 20. Our Dolan. Yeah. Okay. Ugh, that was so bad. Not good. Five. You said this is the Starosta, right? Where's the opening? It could be anywhere, to be fair. Hang on! Oh, that moved it! It was a 19 plus one. 24! Oh no! It's a sign. (inhales) Okay! I can clear the distance, right? 40 feet? I fight with my fists, Sam! Before I run off, I go Does anyone know if this is a time trial, or something? Then I run off towards it. No, I mean, straight towards it. Then, instead of my staff, I'm drawing my two wooden swords that I won with Nott. I'm going to beat face with my wooden swords, with my two attacks. This is going to be great! I was thinking more like flavor to my unarmed strikes, but I'm a monk, so? I'm punching. Yeah. It's funsies. First one's a 14, second one's a seven plus six, so sorry, 20 for the first one and 13 for the second. Okay, ooh! That is 12 damage. Then I'm going to spend a ki point and do one more. Flurry of blows. That's not good at all. Ten. 17. Aw, gross! Don't. Fuck. Me Gil! Ooh, that was almost a natural 20! This always happens with Gil. Six? He gives you heartburn, you guys. It's real bad. I've had this dream. Question, quick retroactive one Can I use my reaction attack when that thing attacked Jester to do my Sentinel thing? Can I do that? Nope. Run away! I'm going to fight, both my swords, pop pop, coming down on his head. Don't fuck me, Gil. That's all right, 18. Disadvantage because I'm poisoned. 18. That's not a thing. Nine damage. I turn to the audience and I go (yelling) I go Yasha, look! I do Patient Defense for my other ki point. Attack with my reaction! Sentinel! Natural 20. Eight. 14. It takes seven points of damage from the unarmed strike. Yes! Fuck! Yeah. No, there could be more groups, man. That was fucking awesome. Fuck yeah. Please. I won't deny it, but I also won't request it. Okay. They had real good teamwork. Maybe we should come up with special moves. What? Did you see that? He had a sign, and then things happened. I could do that. I could be a distraction-- She's Cure Woundsing me! I'll move here. Yes! I love you, Jester! Natural 20! 24. Okay. I'm going to run (counting) 40, I guess? I'm-- Yeah, that's cool-- I'm going to look at this one and I'm going to go, hey (whistles), go fetch! I'm going to throw my other wooden sword at that one, and then I'm going to do Patient Defense. Right in the middle of them. Animal handling. I'm going to use this lucky die that this Critter gave me! Okay! 20! Come on boy! Wait, what do you mean that's my action? I can't take a ki point to do Patient Defense? Okay, so Patient Defense. That's it. What?! I rolled a natural 20! That was a ki point! A very valuable ki point! Fuck! What does restraining it do? Okay, I'm going to look around with my defensive stance and be like "Aw, fucking really?" and then go Parkour! Stab! No, this guy's got advantage! It's fine! Oh, wait, that guy's cone? Well, it's on. I'm coming down very hard and heavy. Advantage. I'll take that natural 19, and then for my second one-- advantage on all of them? I'll take that 13? Okay, so the first one not great, six damage? Second one better, eight damage. Do I still have a little bit of movement? Can I move behind it a little bit? Can I come right here to it? You know what-- nah, it's fine. Whatever works, it's all good. I'm into it all. Hardcore parkour! Fighting's more epic when you're flying through the air! (singing) It does! 14! Yeah, that's eight damage. It's like a Looney Tunes cartoon. My heels are dug in. Show me your belly! Okay, I'm going to take my staff-- after I threw my sword, I'm going to crack it in the nuts and crack it over the top. First attack and second-- first attack is a natural one! It really was. Second attack is a 17. That's in there. That is a four, so eight damage. Spay and neuter your pets! I'm going to do Flurry of Blows and I'm going to do one more. Oh my god! Another natural one! That's two natural ones in my turn. Bob Barker is not here tonight. That's it. Done. Doneskis. I'm not too bad. (shouting) Displacer Beasts! I'm so tapped. I'm kind of into it. I-- There's only like four doors right? Pick the less squishy? It might be a terrible plan. No, no, no, I'm kind of into it. Yasha-- If we stay flanking somebody, anyone who runs away from us-- Maybe we can go, you want to take a door? Yasha and I will take a door. Defend themselves, yeah. I'm fast as fuck. Wait what are all the doors by-the-by? There are four doors? Yeah, Matt, can you please do us a favor and point out the doors? There are five doors. Oh, that's a good point. Four doors, four doors, I'm going to-- I'm going to stay by Yasha. Anything else I don't care. Okay, okay, okay. How about we take Sam's similar approach, but we guard these four incidences. Okay Yasha and I are going to move here, and guard these two. I have no ki points. That's good times. I mean-- You would have been fine. Caleb wussed out.
