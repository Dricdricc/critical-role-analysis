Oh, hi! Apparently we're live because several people just yelled that at me behind the scenes. That's Sam Riegel. This is Taliesin Jaffe. I'm Marisha Ray. Good evening internet, Critters, and Team Hoomaners alike. This is simply a sync test because apparently for the last several weeks, days-- It's not one of those sync tests. We're not recording film. But that is still probably handy. (laughs) So this is just me doing a quick test-- man, that-- I don't know how helpful that is. All right. Thank you guys so much for tuning in for this technical test. We will-- are we already out? Oh. We'll be back for Critical Role in ten minutes if we're not already out. I'm Taliesin Jaffe. A wonderful evening. What? Your social security number. Yeah, you should. Guess who was on this week, you guys? It was our-- No. All great guesses. Foster Wayne Brian. Or Foster George Brian, as I think he was originally tagged. But Foster Wayne Brian, our very own, from Talks Machina. He was on. It's a very funny episode. A lot of us make cameos. He makes a cameo, you make a cameo. I know! You make a cameo. A lot of people make cameos. Actually, you don't. Matt Key makes a cameo, sorry. Not you. Not him. But he does. So jelly. You did creeper? Like a real-- Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 30 seconds back in Tal'Dorei and we're tormenting people. That's us. That's good. I'm not complaining, I very much approve. Feels like old us. Have you lost anyone close to you before? Well then, you should know that that's not celebration. This is coming to terms with a little bit of help. To Doty. Exactly. Doty will live on in your stories. That'd be beautiful. Definitely. You could repair things for small change on the side. Being a hero and adventuring or being born into privilege. Plus, you know, if you're wanting to become a more independent and solitary man, then maybe you learn how to brush your own hair. Thank you. Courtship. And Vax over here is a great wingman. Get it? Because he's-- Thank you! She said, out of accent, appalled. She's so incensed, she dropped accent! Yeah! Are we still in the middle of farmlands, or are we walking? All right, okay. Old faithful. Hello. It's very kind of you. Just be prepared, the Emon you left isn't necessarily the Emon you'll be returning to. It's getting better, but it takes time. He's fine. He's fine. That's the most awkward post-conversation conversation I have ever had. (yells) We'll be in the pub! (laughter) How was traffic? With the caravan! We're so sorry, we know you really wanted to go to the Hells with us-- -- but we couldn't wait, so we had to go. We're so sorry. It was very hot! Yeah, it made my cheeks really red. Really? We went kitten-smushing. A newsie runs by-- Read all about it! Yeah! Wait, do we know people other than ourselves? Oh yeah, we know Gilmore! Yeah, do you want Grog? Yeah, you're knocking this flirting thing right out of the park. Just don't use the word "mate," not even in the buddy sense. "You're my mate." Hard cut! (laughter) Roll for montage! Oh no. Oh no! Maybe we need all these stipulations. Whoever chugs a pint the quickest. Man, that seems hyper subjective, based on someone's internal monologue that we can definitely not hear. Wait, you're jumping in on this? Oh, yeah, on the rating. 50 gold says she hates all of them. Oh, here, right. Is she going to hate all of them? Yeah. Roll for restraining order. (laughter) Grog was basically an asshole, and he still did better than you. That's better than his first attempt! So much better! (laughs) Yeah! No, it's not. Jesus. She definitely-- Wow. Can I roll against that? Natural 20. Tary, Grog is teaching you the opposite of what to do. Maybe individually. Oh no. Yeah? Why don't you, for starters, ask them a question about themselves? Instead of talking about yourself. Maybe less a monetary stat question. Maybe find a question about her personality or about her past or something that interests her. Yeah. Try again. Hi, Tary. Pleasure to meet you. You're getting close. Just try, for once, to think about someone other than yourself. (whispers) Come on. One thing about herself! She's awesome. The alcohol has worked. Why? What is it that you miss about the City of Dis? Was that on your list? Oh. It would have been my first question, too. I'm not going to lie. Sorry. I was very sheltered-- (gasps) were all three of us sheltered on this side? Yay, sheltered kids! Hey. Awkward. What happened to her? We all scooch up chairs. What happened? Apparently. (laughter) Oh, Tary. LIAM AND That's awful. How old were you? You didn't lead with that. Tary, why didn't you tell us that? Maybe we've been taking the wrong approach this whole time. Have you experienced that once? And why do you think that would be any different than our dating strategy? Do you have a reminder of him? Any items? Then why do you feel like you need to impress him? Daddy issues. There's more to respect and honor than just money. A lot more. In fact, generally money tends to make you-- Shittier. I feel like we're suddenly talking about your problems. Still your problems, yeah. Then why did we get mimosas and go shopping when we had our girls' day? Why did we get mimosas and just go shopping on our girls' day? I feel like we got robbed. Totally Trish the Dish. Just say yes. Yeah, learn from Trish. I don't want to think about that. Uhh. Why you asking, Percy? Why you asking, Percy? I'm going to give that a big fat no. The Voice of the Tempest is overruling you on this one. La-la-la, the Voice is very loud right now. Sorry, the Voice cannot hear you. The Voice is going to have to take a message. You were the one who told me that I could not scry on Scanlan to respect his privacy so-- I don't want to watch a Tary porn. You're very strongly peer pressuring me right now Percy and I don't know how I feel about this. Can you even scry? I don't know if you have the-- Do you want to try? All right, Percy. Try to scry. I give him the Scrying Eye. See what you can do. If he crits, I'm going to be so pissed. Really? Are you sure? You have to think real hard about butt-naked Tary. Real hard. Tan lines where his armor used to be. That's right. Nothing that interesting, or something appallingly interesting? Can I do an insight check on him? Just to see if he actually saw anything or not. If he's telling us the truth. 26. Sorry, 27. What? It worked, though! You actually got it to work for you! I'm kind of impressed. Tary's a big boy. You're right, he's not. I hope he's learning a lot of things. Let's just go back to the castle. It's just a few blocks away from the tavern. We can always come back in the morning to send someone to get him, it's fine. It's a small West-- Whitestone-- we're not in Westruun. We've traveled. We've traveled a lot. God, is it just, you know, we travel so much, you don't really know-- Before Percy leaves, I say, (slurs) You know, didn't think, going to be able to use the Scrying Eye, for someone who hates magic so much, might be something more to you! Boop! I saw that from Whatsherface earlier! Okay, bye, go have fun! (slurs) I just can't believe Percy actually used the Scrying Eye. I so didn't anticipate him actually getting it able to work. I thought I was one of the only ones in the group that can make it work, and now he can make it work. Man. What are-- I don't know what you're referring to in this moment. This feels like a lot of meta conversations. Yeah! You're so domestic right now, it's so cute! Hey, do you think they're going to stop allowing you to drink in the street as soon as we get guards and law and order back in this town? I kind of like you being able to drink in the street in Whitestone. It's nice. What were you going to say? No, I'm listening. I'm listening! Mm-hm! Uh-huh. She picked you up again? Okay, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah! I thought I was crazy, but apparently your sister saw her face, because we all saw her face! Yeah, me too! I'm trying to concentrate on what you're saying so hard! Uh-huh. Hey, hey, hey, hey. No feathery white mask face wearing deity is going to take you from me or us, okay? Okay? Because we'll just go god-hunting! And it'll be great! Because apparently your sister said we have to kill Orcus, so-- Yeah. I'm still digesting that, so I think the only way I can really interface with it is just by making jest of it. I'm listening. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh! (laughter) I know! I love her so much too! She is so cool! And she is so pretty! She's so cool. I'm so sorry! Okay! They're okay, right? I know some-- it's been bad, you know? Turned around a lot, and people have not been there, and they're supposed to be there, and they're not-- I'm so drunk! Okay. I don't know if I can! Okay. I love you so much. Okay. The saddest thing. Yeah, I feel really pink. Good morning! Oh! That's why you're being so quiet. Oh. Cassandra. (shushes) Vanquisher. Ooh, yeah. Decimator of Beasts. Yay, Vex! You'll like the Sun Tree, he's very nice. Yeah. Like an amphitheatre? Words. Yeah. I buried a secret clubhouse under Whitestone, at the roots of the Sun Tree. And sometimes I go there and I talk to him. I realise this sounds very uncool when I say it out loud. You're so cool, but I totally didn't put the treehouse in the top of the tree. I totally put it underneath the city. But there's a treehouse. There's a clubhouse. You can go there and be alone, and it's so quiet and peaceful and dark. Although sometimes I do climb into the tree and I hug onto one of the branches-- I need to learn from Pike and Grog how to say no. (laughter) Come on, get it! You're a fucking ranger! Hey! Aw. Hey hey hey. You're making me chew my nails. (uncertain noises) That actually is genius. Yeah, you can have urban settings. Oh no! You're like those Weather Fail videos, you got hit by a tree! She can heal herself on a good day. But that doubled? Oh, that was doubled? Okay. Are you Peter Parkering? Oh! You look awesome! I mean, you look like shit, but you look awesome! Wait. Plus, it's kind of cool that you killed something called a gray render to become Lady of the Grey Hunt. You did it! Can Grog lift it okay, I guess? He's probably the only one.
