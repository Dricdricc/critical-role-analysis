It's my true destiny, yeah. We do our best. There was definitely more than one. It was at least two or three. Dayana Prucine Oh, Orentha. I think it might also be smart to see if we can drum up any type of handwriting samples for possibly both the Lord Sutan and the High-Richter, so we can more convincingly forge documents. With his brain. With his head. You're good at forging, right? We have to get some handwriting samples, right? Of the Lord and the High-Richter, that way we can write letters, make it seem like they're-- Nott, I think we’re going to need you to both break in the house and also maybe into some safe that they have in there. Yeah, you're good at lockpicking. No, we’ll be with you. You can say it. Nott, what was the last thing Caleb said? What did he say? That’s not what he said, but that is delicious and now I want some. I have. I am definitely proficient in mail fraud. There would be a public record somewhere, right? And generally those public records tend to need to be open for-- Well, I will say, worst case scenario, we don't necessarily need to match her handwriting, but some type of coding, potentially linked back to her. We can almost mimic it. People who are doing sneaky things never use their real handwriting. Sure. Maybe some accounts of the Myriad. --of Requital. Where I thought you were going, Molly, which isn't a bad idea to leave some sort of money trail, is leave a certain amount of money with any type of paperwork that might also be mentioned in a document in the adjacent house. So paranoid rich people are always paranoid rich people, right? So they always have these safes filled with documents. Were you guys paranoid? Yeah. We also need to find where Lord Sutan lives. Correct. They might even have some sort of documentation or record. Remember Dolan was saying that they got ousted from their practice because of this Lord Sutan. Maybe they already have a paper trail. We do. Nott tracked them. Do we have any-- That's going to be really cool when I can do that. Really cool. Catch a fly. Anyway, moving on, that was me. I wonder if we can track down Ulog. You think we're big fish? I tie my robe. It's all I've got. No, I got that. Yeah. Okay, well then you go. Feel free to give me like a-- I'll listen for the pigeon. There's a signal, we have one. Do I see-- sorry. Knew that much. This is really good all to know. Now we're getting all this information. LAURA and I don't know, I'd say take the foot-in-mouth signal. (drawl) Mustard. Biscuits. What did they say, though? Okay. All right. Yep. I'm keeping an eye out for anyone watching. Oh, and it's super interesting-- Also super interesting that they mentioned having other people do their work for them. (pause) Okay, let's go! He said they have other people do parcel service and stuff for him. See? Well maybe not even a signature. Most people trying to be smart about not getting caught aren't probably like my name and social security number. You want stationery, sure. Okay well how about this, I think the seal is going to be good; I think any type of money amount mentioned in any of the letters and then we cross that and leave that type of amount of gold in the-- like there's been a money hand off. In between Adventureland and Frontierland. (laughter) Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, well how about half of us go to Lord Sutan's and half of us go check out Ren's. I'll go to check out Ren. I could get through the gate. Okay. I'll go check out-- yeah. We can manage ourselves. We're good. We got this, let's go. What time is it? The Leaky or the Song & Supper? We're talking about two different-- Leaky Tap. Hour and a half, all right. Break. I flip it to the blue side, cobalt. Oh I'm-- Literally like 24 hours ago. Thank you. Are the gates chained shut or does it look like there's a lever? Two in front. Does it look like there's any blind spots, any trees that go up and cusp over the walls? Not good. Eleven. It's a big jump but we can do it. It's not too big. That's doable, yeah. From rooftop to wall. That was what I was thinking, wall to wall. Do they look like one of the-- No balcony. So there appear to be-- No balcony, okay. Uh-huh. A dog, I like dogs. Yeah, maybe a drunk. A drunkard trying to break in somewhere else? You know, a public disturbance. Yeah. I mean our group is pretty good at causing distractions. They can do that. That's totally- Yeah. It's going to have to go fast. Yeah we could do that. Do I have a climber's kit? I don't have a climber's kit, but we can go buy a climber's kit. Yeah. Okay. Guys, let's challenge ourselves. We have to break in, only using ball bearings. How do we do it? Yeah. Do there seem to be any weak points, any loose bricks in the walls? As we walk by, I'm playing with the wall, but I'm testing for weak spots. Oh. I understand now. Oh there's no-- Okay. You know, when I used to hop fences back where I came from-- If you're ever trying to get over barbed-wire or any pointy fences, you take a rug or a bedroll, and you throw it over there, and you hop over and you-- Yeah I mean-- I'm just throwing that out there. It works. A bedroll is not too bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go. Sure. (groans) We're just trying out the gym. We're not fully committed to it yet. All right. Second time your cat just vanished. Simon! What kind of dog was it? Its name was Princess. Come on, stage makeup class! This is going to be the weirdest fanart. Ooh, I hate him. I hate him already. I'd like to say, I feel pretty good about our casing mission. In the meantime, me and Jester are like What’s taking them so long? He took an hour to cosplay his dick! Why are you covered in mayonnaise and egg? And hot sauce? Is that hot sauce? You guys look real defeated, over here. You look palpably defeated. What?! You what?! All right. You know this could lead back to make it look suspicious if we go after Lord Sutan if his son was just broken into, right? He’s going to know his medical notes are missing, right? All right, okay. Sure, sure. All right. Well, I mean, that works because as Dolan said, these fancy people tend to get other people to write their mail and do their paperwork for them, so… Yeah, that never changed. Nott, over here, knows a little bit of Thieves’ Cant. It would look shifty. I’m just saying, from my experience, normally if you’re trying to do a coup-- As a rebellious teenage woman. In my experience, normally if you’re trying to do something bad, you’re not like “Dear diary, I did this bad thing. Signed, Beauregard.” You get what I’m putting down? Correct. We want to look-- if it’s too obvious, it’s the opposite of convincing. This guy goes by The Gentleman because he is smart. That’s all I’m saying. “Spoke to The Myriad,” yeah… It doesn’t really matter. And a little bribery if we’re trying to go for something. It depends. If you’re just handing money off to an assassin. If it’s a lowly level person, might not need much. Doesn’t need to be the whole amount. Just needs to be a payment, maybe. The Big O thing. The plan against the Big O. “It will commence-- “ “Commence as discussed.” And it sounds super boss. Aw, you beat me to it! No signing it with a kiss. What kind of dog? Can the cat become a mastiff? Here’s the deal, Nott-- Yeah. we need to leave no trace. The only way this gets pulled off is if-- Is if no one thinks anyone was there. Ever. We also have good ol’ Fjord, who can always disguise himself as a guard. Correct. I think that’s a good idea. A few papers are always good. Why is there a Magic pack in there? Beau gets a little too aggressive with the pillow fight. Sorry, sorry. Should we get some awesome all-black clothes? Yeah, something a little bit more stealthy. Oh, I like that. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Do we know anything about this festival, like, culturally? Do they wear masks? I think we should go shopping. Masks on sticks. But will it get us through the gate? Are you afraid they're not party people? Well, then we go from there. She's got a point. Show us where Melrose is. Leave it in the trash. That's not bad, that's not bad. Man, that is the oldest trick in the book. Sure. Don't write “the Knights”, though, just write the little symbol. To fight Orentha, to kill her. I feel so political, you guys. I feel like I'm participating in our politics, in a way. It does, it feels like I'm making a difference. Feels like it matters. Yeah, we didn't get paid in advance. I hope that doesn't come back to bite us. Once again, we should leave no trace that we were there. Correct, so first-- With the cat. We've got the cat plan. Yeah, the last thing we want is for the crownsguard to think that this was all us. In front of the-- MARISHA and I was going to say, can we hop a ride? No, that brings a lot of attention, chasing after a carriage. That doesn't mean that won't change in 30 seconds. Do you want to distract him and we'll meet you on the other side? Okay. Nott or Caleb can send you a message. 15. Why is that their natural response in this town? Rat-balloons. Oh fuck! Shit! We were supposed to go fucking meet Ulog! Damn it! We recapped this at the break, too! Damn it! Oh, come on, Ulog! It’s open mic night! You got this! (laughter) (pigeon coos) Oh shit! We almost forgot about Ulog! Oh shit! How well do you know Lord Sutan’s place and the area? All right. Yeah! The fiviest. I hate the color yellow. I just hate it. Any of them look familiar? Don’t fuck me, Gil! Meh, you kind of fucked me there. Ten. Fuck! Why does it feel like you roll crappier when you’re lower level? 13. Same guard. Are we catching them around the same time? This is his shift. Same watch. All right. All the way around. With the spikes. And the gate is closed. But he can still be enough of a distraction to get the guard to chase the dog while we get in if we can get the dog-- Maybe to the front side. That’s what I was thinking. Go into the cellar. As soon as the dog chases away the cat. Well-- Maybe that’s when Fjord can come and relieve the guards? Or he can do that now. But how do we get Fjord on the other side of the gate? What were those guards’ names? There were so many guards. Yeah, but as long as you do a guard that’s semi-recognizable. Yeah, but spikes. All right. All right. Up the tree! I'll go first, so I can try and help anyone else as I go up. Can I do that? Athletics or acrobatics? (whimpers) But parkour. That's not great-- I got to get up there. Eight. Give me a boost! (whispers) Sorry! (pants) I'm sprinter. I'm not an endurance person. Okay? You're strongest. Oh, god. Don't let it get caught. I don't know what to do! Is it flying out of our grasp; is that what’s happening? She's going to try and catch it. Wait. Quiet, shut up! (whispers) Okay, maybe if I get over, I could hold the other end and help people. I think I can. Look, we're basically gods, okay? (laughter) I'm going to cast step of the wind-- Sorry, not cast it. I'm going to use a ki point. I'm going to take a breath, gather my chi. Along the edge of the branch anime run-- Step of the wind gives me, like, double jump distance, or triple jump--dump jist-- Hang on. (victorious laughter) I don't trust Gil right now. I'm not going to trust Gil. I'm going to go with cobalt die. Natural 18. I go along the rope, and tighten the rope as I land. I was, like, tracing the rope. When do we do the cat? The cat. There is a chimney stack, though, right? What? Who would have a door on the roof? I look around. Is there a door on the roof? 18. Okay. It looks like they need to re-roof. Like they haven't done it in about 15 years. Right? So maybe we could get in. Or, go through the cellar. Or, be like Santa Claus. It's happening now. It's real time. Real time! I think. There was a guard named Cloen, who was the guard who saw the spider. Just throwing that out there. Got to get through this roof. I step around. How do the shingles feel? Nott! Do you have a dagger? Can I borrow it? Can I borrow any bladed thing? Thank you. I'm going to jack it up and see if I can-- Does it feel like a trap door? Oh, my god. Yeah, pull up the shingles. Those could be valuable. Are they clay shingles? Very valuable. Yeah. (laughs) Okay. Do you want to let them know that we're going in? Then Beau will go down first. I do the cool thing where, like, I slide down, like a fireman, down the ladder a little bit. Well, I look real cool for five feet. Jester, can you go ahead and cast a spell? The locate-the-thing spell. LEDs, yeah. Oh, fuck. There's undead bodies in the armor! Breaking the law. That was him. That was him. I did not say that. Dope! Yeah! Someone stay watch. We're going to go this way. Do I hear any movement in the house? Not bad, not bad. 15. Okay. The seal's under the rug? Do you have Dispel Magic? Can I do a look for anything that looks out of place, any papers, anything, trap doors? Natural 20. I, avoiding the rug, lightly step over it, and see if I can jiggy the brick out. Oh shit! Does it go away? Give me the papers. We're fighting a carpet! The fuck! Oh, this is going to suck. The Rug of Smothering. 15. Oh my god! All right. I'm going to run up with my staff and do a crack crack. Let me do my fucking thing, man. Let me do my fucking thing. I have no fucking clue. Sorry, Nott. Crack! 16 for the first one. Okay, that is six damage. For the second one. That hits. That's a natural 16. And that's seven damage. Now I'm going to spend a ki point. I'm going to spend a ki point and do something that I have yet to do, which is Extract Aspects. Then I'm going to see if I can catch any reverberations off of the rug. Constitution. Fail! I want to know its damage vulnerabilities. What's it vulnerable to? What?! Do I get something else? Hey guys, Nott's in the rug. Hey guys, Nott's down-- Oh shit. Hits. Hey guys, I think this rug (choking). And before I got wrapped up I said it's not immune to any-- (choking) It has no weaknesses-- (choking) No, it's fine. (choking) This is the best! Can I do any type of attack? What can I do? I just have disadvantage. Okay, I'm going to try and elbow the fucking shit out this rug. I am the best! Fuck you, Gil. 11. No, I rolled my damage die. For the first one. Uh-huh. Second one. No! It's a two. Oh wait, you said-- oh, disadvantage. Wait, what? That's fine. Ouch. Bits of Beau. Bits of Beau are showing. Guys, this rug is expensi-- Don't let me bleed on it! (gasps) I didn't bleed on it, did I? I move off the rug so I don't bleed on it. MATT and Scoop up the rug. Okay. It's okay. What about Ulog? Do they have any symbols on them? On the statues? Do I recognize any symbols or see any symbols on the statues? Ten. It's okay. He always gets his squires to do his dirty work. But we have the seal. He's working with the Myriad, and all that stuff earlier. But we wrote up the letters for the High-Richter too, just so we can stamp. Yeah we did because we put the Knights of Requital in it. The KR symbol. 18. I stuff the letters that we were planting on the High-Richter in the-- sorry, on Sutan into the safe. Close the safe. Run over to the desk, open the desk, look through it. Do I see anything? Yeah, go! Prucine! Dayana Prucine! Sure, yeah. Sure. Yes! Tonight, plan happening, sooner than later. Is there any way I can help her? Like being also proficient in forging in this background and stuff? Ah, you forgot the hooks on the G's! Wow, yes! It looks amazing. You should be proud. Let's get the fuck out of here. Put some shingles back. Okay. Just straight dexterity? 15. It looks all right, right? Okay. I'm going to try to hold the rope as hard as I can. (grunts) Oh come on, girl. Fuck! That's not good. I know. We were three stories up. Do I have Nott on the rope? Can I pull Nott up and roll over and hide on the rope? Or on the roof? So wait, she was on the other side of the gate? Okay. Okay, yeah. I like do a climber's loop harness and tie Nott around me, around my middle section and then get over. No, I'm trying to detach it if I can. No trace. Fucking-- Gil! Gil, you're a piece of shit today! Six. I love you, Gil. Your lips are getting purple again. It will-- I guess-- We'll try and meet up with these guys? We need to get to our next target. Correct. So they'll know to meet us there. Correct. Let's get there and then we'll wait for Jester and Jester. How long were we waiting there? Were we waiting long enough to where we can take a short rest? Fuck yeah. Yes, we can. It is generally your level plus whatever your class is. So I'm 1d8 plus three. Oh no, sorry. I currently have 3d8. Yeah, I mean, good enough. The only thing that's going to be obviously missing is the fucking rug! I wasn't anticipating a rug. But we beat the rug. Get it? We beat the-- we beat it. Ulog. How much longer do you think is left of this gala? Molly. If the High-Richter tries to come back, you have to drunkenly distract her. Okay? You cannot let her come in this house. Well, we scouted it before. And more guards. Same plan. Just go with it. Shut up! There is! LAURA and We met the High-Richter before, you know. Yeah. She had ceremonial armor-- That was gold and white ceremonial armor. Yeah, but I'm sure-- We don't have time. I join Nott. We'll flank. What the fuck? You want me to give you a boost? Nott, come on, ready? Me and Caleb. One, two, three. Just in case? Backup. (hyperventilating) Fuck. God, are you sure, Ulog? You at least need a rogue. All you need is the rogue. Ulog. No, Ulog, why don't we stay? They can plan it. Let's just fucking stay. Ulog, listen to me. You are here. You are a part of it, just let them do this. Trust us. Ulog, this is not the point of why we're here in the moment. Stay focused. We can get your wife out later. Don't blow the whole operation because of your wife. Fuck. Yeah, it's not my thing, you guys. Four total. He could cost us everything. It's coming back around! Do I still see Frumpkin on the wall? Do I still see Frumpkin on the wall? I'm going to try and get Frumpkin's attention. "Tell Caleb to watch out for Ulog." Can Beau be casing and be full-on stealth mode watching for anything? Ten. I'm going to flip my coat to the brown side. I keep walking. I keep walking and I look casual. Do I see any crowded areas? If I get a chance, I want to try and lose him. I'm going to try and move around, yeah, and move out of his eyesight. Anything? Do I notice any following me? Balls. Ten again. Checking for traps, checking for traps. Oh my god, you're on fire! Oh my god. Oh, did you see it?! Five. I switch my robe. Oh yeah, like a bedside pot. No trace. Leave no trace! God no, god! No, don't fucking compromise everything! What do me and Molly see? To the back! 19. TALIESIN and What are the figures?! There's something bigger going on other than us. I try and-- I try and get that back door open and try and get them out. I mean, the house is on fire now. God damn. Holy shit. I think we were a bigger distraction. I think there's something else going. No, we didn't! 12. I go over to the figure, I go over to the figure. Once he's gone, can I wait to-- What does that body look like, though? Big money-- (screams in anger). Fucking shit, what is with these fucking rolls! 18. Sorry, sorry, no, that's super wrong. I saw an 8 and I was adding shit! 11, sorry, 11. Those men were super powerful. Who were they targeting? He was in blue, his gauntlets were dipped in blue. I tried to get Ulog to stay and he didn't listen. Blood. That was a Crick! Crick assassins! Edubation! That's why! They were fucking balls! I know, she did! Well, now! At the moment, though, there's no excuse. Of course. Doesn't mean they're not shitty selfish ones.
