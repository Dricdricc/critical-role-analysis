We love you! I love that you can't emote. It's crazy. Are you committing to this all night? Holy shit. I thought this was for your opening gag. I remember! You made that, though! Holy shit, that's right, that's also going on! Every day feels like a year. The boxes are looking so cool. I probably shouldn't spoil that, but it's pretty cool. I'm so emotional. Where are we now? Are we still in the butcher? Is Rissa still there? Rissa? Sorry. Okay. We were talking about planning, and then sleeping, and then going. I really would hate for our problem with them to end up coming and finding the kids. My words aren't really here right now, you know what I mean. Emotionally. I say we send Rissa to go talk to them. That's true. Maybe we go back to their employer? Yeah, let's hold on to it. Maybe there's going to be some sort of emergency situation. Use node in case of emergency. This is revenge for any time we haven't let Matt go on an NPC, just saying. Wait, are Fjord and Jester going to go call off the employers? I would just hate for them to find the kids and then do something to the kids. I mean, we put Caleb's Alarm across it, but still. Exactly. I don't know. Can you do it to the kids? Yeah. TALIESIN and Man, that solves that problem. We don't need help. We saw bolt-throwers, those giant bolt-throwers. Like, Lord of the Rings-style. Siege towers. Also Lord of the Rings-style. Battering ram, like every fantasy movie-style, but definitely Lord of the Rings and the huge cannons. Pirates. That's what we saw last-- or that's what I think I saw when we did a perception check or something. Uh-huh. Firemark. What? Blades? Oh, god. Do the blades spin? Oh my god. So where's the source? So if we get the source-- Yeah. Doesn't sound like a city I'd want to live in. (sighs) Can we go get suits? Awesome black suits. Yeah, yeah. Something with a big lapel. Maybe double breasted. Sounds great. We would look so handsome, you guys. Oh. Would your dad? Does your dad like pastries? Does he have a sweet tooth? Does he like pies? Let's pick up your dad a pie on the way home. People like pies, right? Meat pies. Would your dad like a meat pie? I just hear people bring pies. Thank you. Beau. But that's okay. It's been a long, emotional day. Hasn't it, Fjord? Oh man. So much, it's been the longest day. We stop and get a meat pie on the way. One for us, one for him? Two meat pie-- sorry, three meat pies! Can we make that a double? Thank you. I throw down for the pies. Mm. That was super smart though. I pass out meat pies to anyone who wants one, but save one. Taxman. Are they heading towards the butcher? It was Rissa's idea. I love that that's what we're calling it. Spinning death machine. No, she just has hearing. Yeah. Oh no-sies! It's a Duracell. Okay. These lenses, I'm assuming they're regular lenses? I don't know, they can still be blinded, right? So it's super cheap and easy to break. Imported. Great. I was going to say, if we can get something to blind it, it's still just a lens. Why not something darker? Like ash, charcoal, black powder. That is darker. Actually, this brings up a-- how much molasses do you have? That's so weird. It’s so abrasive sometimes. I feel like molasses would gum up something that's clockwork, right? Yeah, something sticky. I mean, how do we transport it? Heated tar? In a bucket? Yeah, it gets hard. It's tar. Once we get down! Once we get down! He totally just took a thank you for not his baby being born! I feel like at break time last time, it came off. You made it to break, I think. Don't do this to yourself. When was the last time you left your house, Cleff? Agoraphobic. Just us? Huddle around him, okay. We perform a protective-- No, not that close. We're making a safety bubble. Ah, I can't nominate Fjord? Do you believe in me, Fjord? All right, tar first. Is that far from here? I take my staff out. And I go (vibrating ring) across the gate. Good money or trade for some supplies! I thought we're behind a gate, like locked out. Just sneak in? And they’re mainly gnomes working this-- Okay. So I like, as a plan B, you disguising yourself as a gnome worker. Do it first? I'll keep watch. I'm keeping watch for any workers who might be noticing the bucket. Bravo. Bravo! Nott, how close does Mage Hand have to be? It was pretty good. To the prison! Will it tip over in the bag? We are a contracted group of workers, working for this man right here, Cleff. We're here to take care of the problem that we heard you guys had with the clockwork warden. I stole this die that I got you from forever ago. It's got the little d20 inside of it. I'll take the 12, for 13. What did you say the warden's name was? Wardenhelm Poppin-- Drokrusher. First off-- You don't have to-- okay. Yeah. Same, Rissa, same. We will not take up much of your time if you just let us in to go kill this clockwork warden that this guy made. We heard he was quite a problem. Just let us in; we'll be out of your hair, and you can get back to your work. Remember this guy? Why do people keep calling us that? Look, this guy is funding to take care of the spinning death machine that's in your guys' basement. This should be a city-funded issue, but this guy is being a good, noble citizen and funding it himself so we can come and make a quick buck and kill your death robot. Can we please just go kill your damn death robot? You look like a man who's willing to climb a ladder. War is a great time for opportunity, my friend. (laughs) High-fivesies from across the table. Who would? Who's going to be throwing the tar? You with your Mage Hand, maybe? Yasha and I can try and pin it down, maybe corner it. Start ripping the plates off. Let's get to the door, heat it up-- Any last tips, Cleff? That's a good one. Hamster ball. I don't know. To be fair, I think we were going to rest, and we decided against it. We decided to go. We know she used two-- Fjord's literally the only one that can charm a guard. Unless we bribe a guard. Do some Suggestion stuff? Is this the door? How big is this chamber in here? Splits in the middle, two more sets of cells on the back side. So it looks like a big fork. Does it have a common way? Or is this thing patrolling halls? Should we heat up the tar? So, he can cast two spells; they have to be at third level. And his cantrips are-- So if he casts Armor of Agathys, it's going to take up one of his levels. And Hex would be another one? This place is creepy as shit. Fjord's going to cast Armor of Agathys on himself. Hope that is a good call. What would Fjord do? And Beau puts on her goggles. (like Fjord) Eldritch Blast. Dear spinning death machine. Thanks, Rissa. (whispering) I'm going to assume yes. Hey Jester! (cooing) (cooing) Okay. Maybe Pass Without a Trace, Jester? (cooing) Maybe not. Okay. Nevermind. Keep going. Caleb, maybe save your shit for afterwards. Normally you don't want to get trapped in a room with something bigger and spinning with 12 blades. I think we'd be better off holding this choke point. I'm going to move up and go to the opposite side of where Molly is and peek down the opposite way, just like he did. You know, I like that idea. Maybe Yasha and I can stand and hide and crouch in the corners while you guys get its attention and shoot it from range. What I would be afraid of is if we were all in there, and it eventually did what it did to those bars over there, and busted in. And we were all sitting ducks on the inside. It looks like it-- Can I still complete my perception check and see if I see down here? Not great. Seven. Is there anything that would warrant a couple people hiding while some people got in the thing? Is there something that looks like Yasha and I could maybe hide? I'm a little disadvantage looking at this angle. You could still Mage Hand the tar between the bars, right? Let's try it! That's what I'm saying. Caleb, can you lift that gate spell if we need to get back out? Wait, are you and Yasha going to be on the outside? Neither do I. Yeah, let's do it. But we're going to hide amongst this rubble on the opposite side and you guys are going to start. Yeah. Can I get up on top of the rubble and crouch down? What do you need? A lot of gold dust? I know! Can we grind some gold really fast? File some? Quietly file down gold coins? Scout with the cat. Kitty scout. I'm going to stealthily move forward, back where I was across from Molly. Jesus Christ. This just got really-- 15. Oh no. Where is Fjord going? Make Fjord go by the gate, maybe. Back a bit. Then Beau is going to take out those ball bearings. Let's not kill our friends’ D&D characters. If we still have a bit of an action, I'm going to toss my bag of ball bearings and try and throw a bunch of ball bearings right here. Oh wait, not with advantage, or no? Okay, 18 then. Molly, ball bearings didn't work! Rolling for initiative? I'm rolling for Fjord. Hang on. Sorry. Another person's character. Fjord is 14. Beau is ten. Fjord’s going to cast Hex! I’m going to Hex that "robit." Hang on, wait. That doesn’t-- no. It doesn’t mess with Armor of Agathys, just checking. This is Hex. Then he’s going to take his falchion, he’s going to flip it, and from the hilt, he’s going to go (firing). He’s going to cast Eldritch Blast because I saw him do that once before. He did it before. I’m ripping it off from Travis. Pew pew! 15? Seven plus eight. Right, that magic shit. He’s going to try it one more time. That bounced. Okay, that’s better. 13 plus seven. I’m sorry. Me don’t know how. Six, sorry. Five plus four is nine damage. No, that’s it. I rolled a three and a two plus a four. It’s not a lot of damage. I rolled crappy. What did you roll to hit? What did you roll to hit? 21. So we know 20 hits. Now, Beauregard-- Yes, because I’m scared. Beau is going to-- I’m sorry. I didn’t know. 18 is what hits, y’all! That’s not too bad. 22. Okay. 12. Okay. Being hit with hot shrapnel, I’m going to do a cool pole vault over Nott. I guess. Wait, where’s Yasha? Yasha’s here? I’ll get on the other side of where Yasha will eventually be. Uh-huh. On this side of it. Yep. Then attack! Whack it with my stick. I’m going to try and jam it up in between one of those gears. That’s terrible. That doesn’t hit, that’s like, ten. I’m going to readjust and try and go for it again. That’s the exact same roll. Those are two twos in a row. Two twos. I guess I will do an unarmed attack. So frustrated that I can’t get my staff up there, I’m just going to go and try and whack it with my fist. 17, which just misses. Do I have any more movement? Can I back up towards, or even get this-- I’m just going to stay where I am. Oh wait, hang on, as a bonus act-- no. I used my bonus action. Fuck. Okay, keep going. Yeah, we can hear you now. Oh wait, do it again. It's a pretty tight box we're in. (singing) Playing with your friends' D&D characters! We can't see the sphincter! Oh yeah, sure. That's right. (singing) Because we're flanking, bitch! (exaggerated Texan drawl) I do a cowboy saunter up behind the-- I go under the lollipop and I use the magical field of the lollipop to make it like me walking through a glitter fog machine. I walk up to him, thank you. I walk up, and I'm going to attack with my falchion. I'm sorry, Travis. I'll take that 18, plus that seven. Plus Hex. And then I'm going do Booming Blade with my action. Is that not how this works? Okay, no. I'm going to do damage. Never mind, then I'm just going to hit it real hard. Six plus two plus five, so eight plus five. See my math? I can only do half. I'm so tired. Okay, it's still advantage, right? Yeah, hyuck hyuck hyuck. I'll take that 16. Yeah, somewhere he's getting a nosebleed while this happens. Four plus four plus five, so 13? Do I have any more movement? Like ten more? He's going to back up to that gate a little bit. Two, if he can. He's still in melee? Okay. Yep. That's Fjord's turn. Cleff, you sick bastard! He did! Yeah, he said he didn't have a failsafe. That lying old bastard. Shit. I was really wanting advantage on all my attacks. Oh, but I have Yasha flanking. Okay. Six. Apply changes. (singing) D&D Beyond! Okay. I'm having internet problems. View. Okay, I get advantage on this attack, right? Okay, I'm going to try and once again get up in those plates. That one's cocked underneath. Okay! No, it was cocked underneath. It was tilted. Then I won't use it. Okay, 17 plus seven. I rolled both at the same-- No, first to strike. Okay. Okay. It's still an 18. Okay. Four. Plus another four. Because it's not magical? Even though I still hit, can I try to stun it with a Stunning Strike? I haven't hit anything in so long and I just want to stun something. I've had such bad luck the past two fights. I haven't been such a good monk. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it saves. I'm going to do that. Still have advantage, right? Man, it will be really awesome when that monk ability, that's core of my class, actually works. 17 plus seven. Six. Plus another four, so ten total. Sorry. Since I have two hits, can I do Extract Aspects? Spend a ki point? I get to learn two things now? Can I learn its lowest saving throw ability? Hey Molly, you want to mock this asshole to death? Okay. I'm going to take my last attack. Still at advantage, right? Okay, I hit with a 15 plus seven, so a 22. I have a d6 now. Five damage. I'm feeling so useful, you guys. Yeah, I'm going to stay exactly where I am. Are you using my friend's success to try and make me feel better? Oh, you're trying to use my friend's failure to make me feel better. It's impossible to take you seriously. And Jester is with you. No, don't do that! Go back. Sorry, keep going. I think that's the best thing I've done this whole fight, is flanking. Okay, Fjord is going to walk up. "I'm a warlock." First, he's going to do-- I don't think this is a concentration thing, it's a bonus action. He's going to do Hexblade's Curse. I gain a bonus to damage rolls that equals my proficiency modifier. An additional three damage! I should have done this forever ago. I'm not a warlock! First attack, still with advantage, right? Oh, he's not. It's just Yasha and I. Plus seven. Oh wait, sorry. But I'll take it. Those first two attacks, 17 and 14. d8 plus six. Six plus seven, so 13 on the first one. Same, 13 on the second one. Yeah, can he back up again? Ten? If he does an attack of opportunity, if I move Fjord back, than we get a Sentinel strike, right? Yeah, let's do it! Sorry, Fjord. He hasn't taken any damage, step back. He still has Armor of Agathys, too. I think that's as far as he can go, movement speed-wise. Sure. What?! Okay. Yes, it does. I do. Do I still get advantage because flank? Okay. Yeah, that's a 17 plus seven, so 24. That's an eight on an eight. Plus four, so 12 damage. And he does not move. Ah, Caleb! Oh god! How long has he been like that? 14. Don't fuck Fjord, Gil! Oh, good. 17 for Fjord. Do I save? 14. I had 27 hit points left. Beau’s unconscious again. Roll a death saving throw? That is the thing I do. Do I roll again? Can I take the roll I just used? 14. Should have brought more tar. You really get tired of this dying thing. I guess unconscious thing. Dope. I get 12. Yeah, Beau is going to deliriously-- still really messed up, like a drunk person doing a pointless task-- is going to try and scoop up some ball bearings that she threw, and then after maybe she picks up like ten-- Okay. 12? I tossed my baggie-- My pouch. And did one of these things. So I'm going to get my pouch back, and then-- Okay. Then after I, deliriously tired of scooping up ball bearings, I'm going to stumble back and collapse next to Caleb and also take a short rest. Ooh. (slurring) I don't know, it might be yours. It's hard to tell. (slurring) That's very true. I'm going to remember that next time. (slurring) You're the best, Fjord. Your mustache is traveling. No, he's my pillow! Fuck you, Molly. (groaning) Okay. Beauregard goes I just-- it took a lot out of us. I pass out in Yasha's arms. Yasha? You have to carry me. I rolled way better. You make me feel so warm inside. How many hit points? We're The Mighty Nein. I don't know how long we might be staying in town, so maybe we should go ahead and talk about that deal while we're here? To get out the Schusters? Oh. But you talked about getting people out. Take that 200 gold, consider it their bail and time served. And this guy will agree to that. Right, Cleff? I elbow Cleff. Total? Well, considering you have a hunk of metal down in your basement that is worth at least 100 gold worth of scrap that I'm sure the Assembly Yard would love to have-- Fjord can foot half, since he's sympathetic. He's like, "No money was spent!" Kids are expensive! Gilda? Wallace? Why don't we get outside and then we'll talk? Let's just say your kids made an impression on us. I was going to say eclectic, but sure. It's like being in Vegas for more than 24 hours. You're like, "No! Not again! I can't do "this for a third night in a row! Ugh!" Oh, your way was way more cool. (whistling) (knocking) This is making me really emotional. Kiri. (exhales) A favor. In return-- No, you were nailing it. We did a jinxies thing, yeah. Fjord's right. No child should be separated from their parents. Unfortunately, this little one was. You've learned. Shit. I turn to Gilda and Wallace and say Look, I know another mouth to feed is a lot. It would mean a lot if you take her, but we'll help you out. I reach in and I give them 50 gold from my stash. Should be enough to help for a little bit. Hopefully make up the difference. Well, I stole 75 gold from my friend without him being here to speak for it, so I feel like it's fair. Go give Jester a hug. I know she wished she'd be here for it. I give Jester a hug. You already are. Look at this handsome lot. You look like you need to be a vinyl decal on the back of a minivan. That might be the first nice thing I've ever done. I don't know what this emotion thing is. It's weird. It probably isn't. On the way, I look for someone who wasn't the guy who hated us before selling more of those poppers, because I want to stock up before we get out of this godforsaken town. Another set of ten. Yeah! Yeah, Caleb? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it wasn't too bad. Honestly, I don't really have a lot of plans. My entire life has been plans being made for me. So it's nice not having plans. I ran away from the Cobalt Soul. I have ideas. I don't know if ideas would count as plans. I'd be willing to help you, under one condition. Can we agree to keep each other straight? If either one of us tries to turn and do something stupid, or lean a little bit more evil. Chaotic, whatever you want to call it. Anarchists? Let's just make a pact if either one of us do anything stupid that maybe we're each other's failsafes. I don't think I want to hurt any more people and I don't think you do either, so maybe if we keep each other from hurting other people. That's not true. I do want to hurt people, just not people I like. Let's hurt bad guys. Skype high-five! MATT and Can you do the-- give me a-- Don't know if a lesson was learned here, but all right, let's continue on. Cleff, maybe if in the future we come back and need a repair or something spiffy, you'll cut us a deal? And hey, I don't know if you know the Schusters at all, but if you see a family walking around, little bird child, maybe watch over them for us. I acknowledge that, and thank you. Fuck you, Molly. What time is it? Yeah. To Shitty Creek? Yes! If you're deserted on an island, to kill yourself with? My heart. They were in a Silence spell. Better be some dope investigating at the top when we come back. Blood! Splatter! Some CSI shit! Up in here! Yeah, we’ll have dope one-liners. The Who. It’s going to be great. We didn’t kill Fjord and Jester, though! By puppeting them. We took some money, but that’s a good cost for not killing them. That 75 gold? So we have the haversack. And if they get disarmed-- We’re just selfish. You sound like it. Congrats to Laura and Travis! No, it's not misery. It's beautiful and amazing and incredible. The day's not over! For me, at least! Let's move.
