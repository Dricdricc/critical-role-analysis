We're winging it today. Sorry. It's so hard to get all of us in one place at the same time. Yeah, we'll bless them. Or he will. Valentine's-- next weekend! Come spend Valentine's Day with us. Even if you're not a DM, you should go look at them. So you can keep making more! Be a kind clicker. (Last of Us clicker noises) The internet always understands sarcasm! Hey scarf man! Thanks to the Critter who sent us bacon jerky. That was amazing! Honestly, it's impressive that you were the one that lived. Yeah, are you kidding me? He'd be the first one that would be like, "Oh, rivalling--" It is adding to, like, the tavern-ish feel of this place. We don't know. We could be all that's left. But does it lead out into the city? What, where? Gilmore's? It depends on who knows! It's a way out of the city once again. That was all through the-- Through the bar, in the-- Allura. How far does your arcane connection reach? Can you feel when you lose connection to other cities? You're leaving? This is a takeover. For some reason Thordak doesn't want to leave this city. Why? Well, they just made it to Westruun, several hundred miles away, in all of 40 minutes? I'm tapped out, too. You're going to go on foot? Allura, if you're going to Westruun, and what you say is true, that we have two potential options for finding out how to defeat these dragons, should we be heading to Vasselheim? Maybe that's best where we're needed right now. Yeah, for the most-- yeah, yeah. It's the city that was closest to Pyrah. My people, my tribe. We could pull double duty, we could go and I can-- Grog! Now is not the time! It's a hazard zone right now? Yeah. That thing was also several hundred feet below ground. How are we going to get that dragon down there? Being shady! That's not a bad idea. You might be surprised. You might like it! You know, speaking of spies, does anyone else feel like this is fairly convenient timing? Someone in that council had to have known this was happening. Wouldn't you? All of the Cloudtop District was in one place! Someone knew! It was the perfect opportunity to strike! They took out the entire upper echelon of the city in one strike! They waited for them all to be in one place. The timing was perfect. That's all I'm saying. What if we go and find a shady individual, like he was saying. What if we don't send in Scanlan. What if we find someone? You're probably right. Which happened at nighttime, remember. What time approximately? After midnight? I Druidcraft a little tulip and hand it to Allura. In case we need to be in contact. Yes, we've learned that much. What time-- Wait, hang on. I still have one 5th-level spell left. I can Commune with Nature and try and find out if a few people are still left in the city before we go to sleep. If we're not going out. I can Commune with Nature and try to find certain people. All right. I go out to Pike and the Sarenrae temple. You will be all right. Everyone calm down. We've had a rough day and it's been hard on everyone but you should be safe here for the evening. Hopefully. Everyone-- Look, I'm not-- I'm trying on this whole leadership thing, okay? Ugh. Eight. Any little bit of hope works. Secrets! Your sword. You're promoting Gilmore's to your sword. I reach out and I grab her hand and say, thank you, truly, for everything. I don't know, but I want it. Well, I'm doing my Commune with Nature spell. I drop down and mediate. Do I sense Gilmore's presence? A few miles. A presence. Can I focus in even harder and find where that presence is coming from more directly? His shop? Okay. Last question, do I sense Uriel? I don't know. It's hard to say. We should check his shop first. Uriel, I don't know. Maybe he's dead, maybe he's gone, I don't know, I don't know. How about this, let's find Gilmore, if he's alive or dead then that will answer a lot of questions, how's that? So we're going now? Tonight? I don't know, maybe we should go. How bad are we? Okay. I remember. Well-hidden. Wait, what? We only restore half each night? Just half. Good to know. I don't think I used any. Sexy, sexy exotic accent. Wait, you hear that? It's pens hitting the paper. It's fanfiction right now. I go ahead and light up a hand. It's like unclasping a bra. Cleric down. Oh. She's going to call back. She said we turned into robots. She disconnected. I do have Polymorph. We need to make him tinier, anyway. What do you want him to be? I have a question. If I polymorph Trinket, can I then use Beast Sense to be able to see through him? Would that be able to work? Beast Sense lets me see through the eyes of a beast. But does it stack with Polymorph? And if he is like polymorphed into-- I mean, I guess he's still a beast. All right. It's fine. But if I turned him into a bird, I can make him an aerial scout, is what I was thinking, like the wargs in Game of Thrones. I will make him a cute little sewer rat or like-- Can I make him a lemur? (laughs) How about a red panda? I'm going to make him a red panda! Yeah, it's a good breed. And we've got Pass Without a Trace. Do we want to go through the city or along the outside of the city? Are we going to take the long way or the direct path? 19. Yeah, I rolled shitty. Sorry, Ashley. I assist. Okay. He's heading towards us? Yeah, does he see us? I do flame hands. Come squeeze. Oh, shut the fuck up! I didn't know that! You can download it on iTunes. Hi, Jason. Why don't you make him come over here? These are tiny tables. Look, he's been under a lot of stress, all right? Our thetan levels are off the charts right now. Oh. You recognized us, why? How? We were there recently. Have you been through the city? How much is left? Have you encountered any more survivors? We are trying to get to the Abdar's Promenade. Do you know each other? (laughter) I might be able to clear it out. We can take the tunnels under-- I might be able to tunnel us to the closest tunnel system, from right here. Move Earth. Sixth level. Do we want to do it now? I'll save it. To get to the tunnels? All right, let's just walk. We'll walk faster. Does he benefit from Pass Without a Trace? Fire hands. We've had a really shitty day. We've all had a shitty day Who's him? You just thought wrong. Fuck these assholes! Therapeutic ass-kicking. That's pretty good. Nah. Fuck that. We're way more pissed off-- Yeah. Yeah, we're not going to kill them. We'll just beat their faces in. Insight check. Can I insight check him? The three of us got up in their face. I think Scanlan and Pike were towards the back. I'm next to Percy. What do you think, Garthok? I don't know, what do you think, Waynethok? 17. (laughs) Fuck that one guy in particular. But you're Percy. The opposite! (laughs) The exact opposite. That guy is dead, right? Ouch. Yeah. All right. Ah! All right, I'm really pissed off at this guy who just decked me in the face. So I'm going to cast Call Lightning. And can I reach out and, the guy who hit me, can I reach out and grab him and call it right into him? Yeah. Just grab his face after he just punched me. Dope! Even cooler! Totally meant to do that. Nah, I want to-- I want to take it. I'm pissed the fuck off. I was going to say, I get extra damage, right? Is it four? Do I get an extra d10? Is that what I get, or-- Do I get anything extra because I'm holding on to him? Because I'm channeling it? 25 points. 18. Yep. Failed. Yep. I use my bonus action to go Minxie. Yeah, it's been a while. I get a little bit of foam going, you know. This means I can finally use my gift from Mary! Sorry, I had it and I was distracted. Grr. I'm so excited. This is what life is about, you guys. (laughs) I know, I know. Same fucking roll. Oh my god! There we go, that's better. That was awesome! Oh, yeah. As a tiger? Or no, I keep my AC, right? Or no, I take the tiger's AC. Then 11. I know I keep all of my brain stats, but I lose all my physical stats. Okay, so 11. Oh no, wait, wait, wait, wait. 12. Oh, cool! Okay, cool. Okay. Really pissed off at this guy still. I'm going to concentrate and bring down a bolt of lightning in front of him, or behind-- Yeah. It's also a cloudy day. So, okay. Six, ten, 21 points, so ten? And then I'm going to do an attack on him. Grr. I thought it was bonus. I thought you could do that with Call Lightning. Okay, that's fine. I can't do anything else, can I? Nice! That's hot. Shut up! That keeps happening? I stay in Minxie form and stay on him, growling at him. Oh, that's going to be good. That's good. I pace along as Minxie. I pace around. I go back, I guess. I was useful. Me, too. (laughs) I came along as intimidation. But he was bringing stuff back and forth to-- Still in Minxie, pace over. Wait, wait, wait, not yet! Sherri. I drop Minxie form. What was her first name again? Empress what? Esalda? With an E? I mean, I can try and assist you, Pike, with Cure Wounds. That's all I have right now. Fading fast? And I did a 16 on my Medicine check, with her 22. What? We were so worried about you! We've turned it into a safe haven. We're so sorry. Everything's gone. What do you mean? I mean, it seemed like we were heading out? Are we heading out? Wait, wait, wait, you want to go steal from Thordak? Do you all remember the last time I told you something was a terrible idea? It was a few days ago-- Right, right. This is probably another one of those times. Vax. Remember the last time we went somewhere to go get a big pile of shit? We were flanked here at Gilmore's Goods. What makes you think that they're not going to have a ton of people sitting there watching that well? Yeah, that, right. That's worked well in the past. Hang on, hang on. Hang on. We're all going to the Clasp entrance? Which is in the same direction as our keep? Because we have a crippled guy on our shoulder. I don't want to use that in case we need to tree-shoot us to Vasselheim. Or somewhere. I grab Vax's hand and pull him back as they pace away. What? Don't, wait! Vax, Vax, listen to me. No, Vax! God fuckin', you-- I go through to my earring. Vax, talk her out of it. This is not the time to be looting for treasure. That's only ever brought us grief. Talk her out of it. Who's taking the kids home? You're coming with us? With the kids? I'll cast Pass Without a Trace on us. On team back-to-the-keep. We understand. We've got the kids. Are we all rolling stealth? 25. Oh no! Yeah, that's what I think. We're babysitting. Boof! Not today. Keyleth goes, yeah, you better run! We're almost home. Almost home. Why wouldn't we take the secret passage? It's here, right? No? I did! I did! Do you want to go see it? We can't disappoint the children. It's okay, it's okay. I think we've pulled a lot of our beds down-- We'll find a place for you. Just get comfortable for right now. It's a little cramped, I'm sorry. It's not Castletop. I find a bed. Where's the nearest bed? Is there someone on it? I say, hey, beat it. Keyleth runs up to Vax and gives him a hug. You're okay, you're okay? You did it? You talked her out of it? Thank you. And I walk away. Yeah, Garthok! Party on, Garthok! You're also one of the dudes in Avatar, when they--
