What?! I think you were the only one who got the shitty end of that deal. Wait, there's a river? Really? Okay. It's okay. 18. Or I could part the sea. I'm going to take my staff, and I want to feel how deep it is. I thought we were there. It's a lot going on. And it looks like a long river? I don't think we did. Okay, let's go save our friends. I didn't say I was trying to leap across. The people who are in the water, are they being dragged under? We can just not see them anymore? Yeah, Percy? Percy? Why does everything here hate us? Percy! Aw. (laughter) Grasping Vine is a bonus action, yo! Wait. No, it is. Sorry. So the river doesn't hate magic? All right. I'm going to cast Control Water. Where do I see Percy? Is Percy and Vax together? Vax is? Or Percy? Okay, so first, I'm going to Control Water. I'm going to stop the flow of current and see if I can get it to burp out Percy. I'm going to burp the river. No, okay. Yeah. Wait, what? Just a straight wisdom? I just spent a lot of money on these dice today! Oh, a 15. I rolled a one. Grog. Grab Percy. Grab Percy. Ten-sider! Can I try again with the current? It's a concentration spell up to ten minutes. Even the water's angry! (screams) Okay, that's better. Straight wisdom? A saving throw or just a check? 16. No, we haven't even gotten started. There's like 50 more creeks in front of us. It's a river of impulses? Such an allegory for so many things. I didn't learn mist form today. Does it look like all the rivers are connected? He's fine! If Bigby's Hand had about ten seconds left, I've got about nine minutes left on this Control Water spell. Why don't we try and move as fast as possible along with the chain and maybe the Immovable Rod. Let's go. You guys go first. And I'm going to try and halt the flow. No, it's another fucking one! Useless! I spent so much money on these! Percy! Don't touch my dice, Percy! I do, but I can only cast that on myself. We can use mist form. Sorry. There's Teleport Via Plants, which I did not bring today. I brought Control Water, Grog! Dimension Door. I could potentially turn us into animals that can swim, which is why I was wondering if the rivers were connected. Maybe we can jump like salmon, going upstream? I can, and I did bring Move Earth, as well as Wall of Stone. To be totally honest, I am terrified of messing with the ground. I'm afraid if I move the earth, it will eat me. It will split open and swallow me. I could try it. They're magical rivers. Why didn't we think of that? Hey, Grog. Remember when we almost died because I picked a flower? Just throwing it out there. Of the Control Water? All right. Let's do this. Can I try and stop the current once again? 300 feet. Okay. Calm, waters, calm. Oh my god. I am not giving you all that dice! (laughter) It's a fucking one! For the third time in a row! We all get ropes! That's acceptable. 22. Keyleth's got angry tears of frustration in the back as she's trying to control the water. Runny eyeliner, like it's 2001. Fuck you, no. It's a 19! Total 19. I'm sorry! Just go! That's a really big catfish. I didn't mean to do that. I was really nervous. But it's an 18, so 25. You know what, Percy? So I'm going to talk. I'm going to be like Look, river. I'm your friend. I don't want any tension between us. I'm just trying to make it across you, you know? Good river. Good boy. Acrobatics or athletics? 15. 20. Shut up, really? I don't think that's ever happened before. That's never happened. Yeah, because it didn't happen last time! So it has roots. It appears to be plant-based? Okay. I'm going to go a little risky here. I'm going to cast Speak With Plants. Dumb idea, yeah. Sure, but he appears to be fellow kin. I've done this before with talking to the treant. What if I cast at a higher level? Would that help? Well, I cast it, so I'm going to say Hey! You spit that out of your mouth right now, mister! (laughter) Seven. Where am I? Oh, I see where I am. Can I move towards that tree, away from the river that also wants to eat us? Okay, yeah. All right. Cool. Done. Go. Have you told many people that? She couldn't do it anymore. Hide behind his uvula, Grog! Can we assist? Come on. Big money, no whammies! Okay! You have advantage on the next hit on it? I am going to cast 5th-level Blight on him. He is a plant creature! I get how much extra? 19. I said, spit him out! That is caca! Spit it out! I want to move and flank him a little bit if I can. Get on his six. The other way. That's good. Closer, a little bit, to him. One more closer. No, back one! Back! No, it's fine. Yeah, your counter ring. Wait, he's in the crocodile's mouth now? You're tripping, man. You're frightened? Oh no, it's a bad trip. Son of a bitch. Oh shit. No, I thought I attacked. Kill it! Garmelie! Oh! It's me! Oh dear god. Okay. I am going to do what worked really well last time, and I'm going to do a 4th-level Blight. And what I want to do is, I want to take my staff, because I'm near him, right? Okay, I want to take my staff, and where Pike put that nice little crispy donut hole in the middle of him, I want to take my staff right in the middle and bring it down and cast Blight. That's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me. My ego loves this. Is Percy still in his mouth? Okay, I'm going to say Stop putting foreign objects in your mouth! It takes hold? Okay. How about this? You know the petrified forests in Arizona? Can I petrify him? Hey, Percy! How's the weather up there? Thanks. Keyleth wants to get down on the grass that she hurt, and I want to cast Druidcraft and heal it, and talk to the grass, and be like It wasn't personal. I hope you know you were not the intended target, you just happened to be caught in the fray. It's okay. Don't be mad. I like your enthusiasm, grass. I get a souvenir from the Feywild! That's all I wanted. I'm in. Yeah, do it. Three-point landing. I'm left. Okay. You want to shot put this one? Okay. Hut! No, fuck that new dice. Nine. Not great. I gag a little, try to keep it down. Try to wash my face if I can. You're committed now. Bye! Are we in the bog now? I want to test and see if we sink when we step on the bog. It comes to a stop. I could rest and learn mist, and we can mist across. That was what I was going to say. Oh my god! It's a 31. I give him a-- from a distance. I give him a-- 24. But we're only 80 yards out. Feet? 80 feet? Total? This is not the tree we're looking for. The whole time, us who were waiting have been do-si-do-ing around each other. We don't stop moving, so we're dancing in circles. The pixies and fairies haven't been that nice. It's a bonding trip. I think you find her charming. I find her charming, too, but it doesn't mean that other people might. We're still doing a do-si-do, by the way, while we're having this conversation. Is there a nearby tree that I can climb into? Yeah. I get into a vantage point. I get up into a tree, and while they go do their recon, I want to cast Commune With Nature. Yes. Do I sense a cancerous tree in the area? Yeah, I'm not asking the tree. Northwest. Okay. So I can safely assume that the tree that they're heading towards is not cancerous. I'm meditating. Then can I get a general lay of the land and sense running water and rivers, so we can avoid those? Oh. Okay. For my last question, can I get a sense on any big evil things that might want to kill us? Everything. More specific that I won't screw it up. Are there Twinkies? Are there any more large crocodile dudes living under the-- I don't know. Any more large things living under the swamp? Yes, under the swamp. Well, wherever. Just blanket it. Does the tree in front of us count as a corrupted plant life entity? And none of the pixies that live in there are showing up on my radar as bad? This place sucks. It's so sad. The trees are so sad. A little bit of both. They're fine. (laughter) I think Vex might be right. Was she really tall? Do you know if she was tall? That is true. Oh no. (laughter)
