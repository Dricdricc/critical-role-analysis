It's weird looking at your D&D characters and being like, "Oh! They were so young! They were babies!" Sagas of Sundry Madness is coming out next week! Yeah! I thought it would be spoilery. Yeah, I thought about it. I was like, "Should I? Eh." Yeah. Thrashtopia has been uttered into the universe. Could we make that happen? I'm going to talk to Ben! Ben. Let's make it happen. Let's do this shit! Oh god! That's what I was going to do. I'm trying to one-inch punch this. What do we roll for the one-inch punch thing? What do I roll for one-inch punching? Do I use the red? Always two, copy that. Okay. I don't know what that means, but I'm into it. All are successes but two. Four successes. Shit, I fucking broke it! Rats? We all have rats in there? I'm up, right? Situationally famous. I'm going to give another whack where I've already indented it. Same roll? Yeah, it doesn't make a lot of sense. I don't quite understand it. Okay. Three successes and three failures, two failures on the red. Yeah. Bucket list check? Start with the pinkies and work your way back? Middle finger swear, yeah! LIAM, LAURA, and So dehydrated, you guys! Oh, buddy! I'm going to go ahead and eat a rat, too. Pop him off, Ozzy Osbourne-style. I catch the rat and I eat it. How am I going to catch it? Do rats like-- hmm. What do rats like? I'm going to do little rat scratches on the-- I can manipulate animal ken! Come here, you little fucker. Three successes, two failures. One failure on red. Well, I'm in a coffin. Sam! Okay! Max! Now we all know how you feel about us. Let me know if you need help pushing! You should eat it! Yeah! Okay! I'm confused. Oh yeah, they're yelling for each other. I know! This is why you don't do this on a daily basis. It's real good. Okay, we double-team it. Let's do that. Ooh, I got a ten! Ooh, I got two tens! One's an X-ed-out X. One on the red. I'm so sorry, sweetheart. You look all right, though! I mean, you look-- You look as bad as we do, but okay. Can I go to the nearest surface and see if there's a dust layer? I want to take a look around. While they get Sam out, I'm going to look around. I've got a ten and a seven on the red ones. They're kind of refreshing. Don't judge, man. We are in a survival situation! You know there's not good crafty! Does it look like it was deliberate, or like it was part of the Thrashtopia set? You guys, someone took their time to tell us that something is wrong. I'm going to go over to the green lights and see if I can screw them in. The big body doors? The big stage doors? Grab that fucking helmet, it is worth some money. Can I bend down and see if there's any of our stunt swords, or can I snap off a chair leg and arm myself? Two successes? Oh, babe, we should look out for those Warcraft props. Those might also be worth some money. Really? Let's try and get to the kitchen. Well, we've got to go that way anyway. Ooh, I got two tens! Same thing! And the rest are successes. TRAVIS and It's probably Sean, he works so late. Does it say, "Things are getting creepy?" It's a box? They might be in the prop closet. I do! It's on Sean's desk. I've got to get to the desk, I've got to get to my office. Okay. What was it again? Dex and--? Double failures. On the red. Yeah, everything else was real good! Yeah, two, yeah. They both were ones. The red ones were ones. Do I see my reflection in the server room window? Yeah. What do you mean that's not--? What? Does it still look like a big, fatty computer? Meat computer. Babe! This is some Buffy shit! Look how awesome! Do I look cool? Dani! Wait, did she us? Look, isn't it awesome? I've got to get the key card, so I'll go with you. Continuing my mission. We've never fucking drank tea. Two. Dani. Sean doesn't drink tea. Is Sean in there? Why the fuck didn't I get an email?! I'm going to go in the creative meeting. They're in my office. Yeah. Is this a coup? Is Taliesin taking over? What did Taliesin do? I'm going to go look over Key's shoulder, look at his iPad. Scroll up. Sure! All successes except for one. Is there anything that we have said further up in the document? Including when we weren't in the room? Right. Does the spore puff do anything? I was leaning over his shoulder. I don't know, did I sniff the spores? Stanima? I've got to think about it now. Just straight stanima? Two successes. It's blood! I'm so thirsty. Okay, I sit down on the grass. Is Arwen here? I have some tea. Oh, you've been talking to the lock. Wait, is Father Father his full name? Like first name, Father, last name, Father? It's my fucking office, bitches. I've been drinking the tea. I'm not getting dosed, am I? That would suck. We always knew you'd be the first to go in the apocalypse. I'm not there! I'm in the office! This is a great creative meeting. I kind of miss this. Oh my god, that's so sad! I pop out of the office-- Yeah? I was going to go talk to Dani. You know, it looked real good. You said it looked bloody. I'm real thirsty. Ashanti about a Sean tea?. Wait, you mean it's Sean tea? (shouting) I'm drinking my best friend's essence! That's gross! It's just something I ate. Mushrooms have never sat well with me. (whispering) Take my safety deposit! The wedding is probably not happening after those two conclusions! Don't burn down the company while I'm dead! [break]
