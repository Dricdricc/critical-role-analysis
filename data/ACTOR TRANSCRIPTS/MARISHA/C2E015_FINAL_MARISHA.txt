I love the shade she threw you in her spare time. What is that?! I didn't know you played. No, you have to do it every month, It's really obnoxious. It's free! Everyone asks if it supports us, we get a lesser cut or more cut, it supports us the exact same way. And Beau, Jester, Fjord. (laughs) Whack! You gave me holy oil and you holy oil. It's a like a splash grenade. It was Guinevere. Where do you-- why? Heart! Do I notice any textures on any walls? They talked about the north side of the wall being more textured and having a pattern. Try the north side. We're on a jet ski; this is great! (whispers) We're on Pirates of the Caribbean! Have you been practicing any of the techniques that we tried out? Sure, that's good! Oh, that's cool! We did bad. Nine. Nine. It's okay. It's not that big a deal. So it did like an ink cloud. Okay. I'm going to go (mild screaming) and do a straight whack on it. Sorry Fjord, it's on you! Ooh, that's a natural 19. 25. What is it? 1d-- that's not great, six damage. Did I hurt you? Okay! (whack) I deck him right across the face. Yeah, I'll take that, 16. Okay. Seven damage. Ah, one more. I'm going to do flurry of blows. That's a natural 17. That's a four, eight damage. Uh-huh. Sorry. Okay, is the one still next to me? That was attacking Fjord. Oh, there's one on Caleb. He's still on top of him? I'm probably not within five feet. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I'm going to do some cool monk shit! I'm going to-- (confused battle cry) Continuing on, I'm going to leap across and see if I can do a jump and a slap with the staff on top. Parkour. 14. I'm going to swing upwards. Yep, that's a natural 16, so 21. I don't know why I rolled that die, that's not necessary. Nine damage. I take my staff and I wipe it on Caleb. Sorry, are you all right? Your head's okay? Yeah, the oil's working for you. Yeah, very dapper. Eventually. Full Winklevoss twins! You're feeling guilty for calling him rock-face, but not for telling him to eat shit? I like that. That's great. Drinking a drink with cold ice. We were looking for a collapse. A change in texture. This is it. They said that the glowing orbs that made the men collapse were purple. That's a nice sconce. I'm always a fan of going down. What? I'll take up the rears. I have no chill? You talk to me two minutes later. I don't think so. Rogue shit! Ball bearings you stole from me. Definitely a puzzle. I feel like this is going well. I'll hold up the back. I want to look around and see if I see anything that looks of value. I'll take that natural one and give another $100 to 826LA. Wait up for me! Miss. I want to catch it. Knowing it's coming. 1d10 plus eight. (groan) Wait, how many? 11. I caught it! Argh! Those are from earlier. It's this thing? Oh shit. Look how cool! Yeah. You said this was pretty big. Can I do a check to see if I recognize any of these things? I can use my mystical erudition to spend a ki point. I get advantage on this. 18. Cool. Yeah, it's like magic people code. The people I learned from were super into this shit. I think it's a puzzle. I feel like this thing rotates and we have to match the symbols on the bottom to the symbols that match the school of magic. It feels like the divination is a full symbol of the star. Evocation, right? Then the diamond-- What would the diamond be? I bet there's a key. I'm going to start looking around, digging, seeing if I see anything that looks like it would fit the shape. I'm also going to shout out Be careful, the shifty three were talking about an octagonal room where they got attacked. Maybe we've got to go all the way back up to the top. The spiral staircase. We need a down here team and an up here team and maybe a Frumpkin to communicate through. That looks like it would fit in the rod. Okay. Okay. 16. You work so fast. The stairs are back through the hall and up, right? They're not in these chambers? It's one big chamber? All right, I'll jog up the stairs. Oh, sorry. Get it, girl. TRAVIS, MARISHA, and (singing) To the front, to the side, to the back. Disarm that trap. Hey, can I keep that? I think I can throw it later. Thank you. Thanks, Nott. Oh, sorry, here's your thumb back. I just want the bolt. Yeah, who's going up? I have a feeling there's going to be a lever-y or a move-y situation. Yeah, you might need opposable thumbs. Sorry! I'll take the front. Any ghosty globbies? Natural 20. Okay! On the ground? Okay. Are they like profiles, or are they front? Looking up, deadless? Okay. Copy. Sorry. Absorbing a lot at once. Keep going. I relay all of that, of course. I do. And we can see it-- sorry. We can see a closer of the dome with the symbols on them? Oh, we're not there yet. Sorry. We're just up the spiral staircase. I'm assuming it's through the collapsed tunnel. Right. Okay. Got it. That feels like that might be a trap. Ooh. All of them? Here we go. I would be probably be in between Fjord and Caleb. 22. Little shits. They what? Is that true? Copy. Nein. Miss. Okay. You want to go first, girl? 15 didn't? Did you try to shoot it? Okay, seeing Nott have a hard time, I'm going to pull out that holy water and I'm going to, like a confetti popper, I want to, right over its face, just break it. Yeah! Just straight attack? With my dex, to throw it even though I'm not throwing it? I'm not throwing--the holy water. I'm trying to break it with my hand and palm in its face. 12. Is it a dex saving throw? Okay. Do I still get my bonus attack? Natural 19. 25. Eight damage. Do I punch a ghost? Okay. A little cold. Yep. Does that mean I get to make an opportunity strike against it? That's okay, that's okay. 21. Another eight points. Yeah, go. Nice! That's what we do! I know. I don't feel so bad for making fun of them now. I feel like maybe we were hard on them, but now I don't think we were. Okay, we can keep going. For the boatman. Holy shit, that's awesome! Beau hollers out Hey, I think you figured out that puzzle! Let it fall! Whenever we get done with the short rest, can Beau start peeking through and digging away at the collapsed entrance into that tunnel? It wasn't good. Six. Slow going. Was there a little crawl space at the top that we could crawl through? Well. It's just me and I rolled shitty. The ceiling is through here and it's blocked by a bunch of rubble. We can try and dig through it if we think something should be up there. All right. I've been, like small boulders. I've been (struggling). If the thing goes two clicks-- correct, it goes there. So wait, divination, evocation, necromancy. And elemental things, right? Isn't evocation-- Fire, lightning, elemental things. Something bad might happen once we turn this, so be on guard. I'm going to join Molly, I think someone needs to be upstairs. You guys stay. Yeah. I got you one better. I'll shove in my staff and push against the pillar and use it as leverage, see if I can pry it open. Ooh, natural 18. 22. You see this is like a simple-- sorry, it's like a simple tool. Sorry, I drooled a little. What? You know what? That's fair, I'll take that. That was a good one. It was a good jab. We heard you. Wait, but you did necromantic, right? Maybe it's a trial, maybe we have to fight all of them! I'm going to use my boots at this point. 20 to 15? Negative, no. Sentinel bitches! They suck you up. It's bad. I don't know! We attack at advantage? For how long? Is it concentration? Don't break that concentration! Jell-o! Do we just slap jello? I'm going to do a full-on-- Yeah, doing a full-on jello shot. That's good, that's an 18! Plus six, so 24? Seven plus four, 11. No. Okay, I'll go for the 20, in case I roll a natural 20. I did not roll a natural 20. Does it feel like I did some damage? Okay, I'll take my bonus and whack. Or you know what? Yeah, I'm going to whack it. Slap that jello. TRAVIS and That's good! That's 21. Six damage. It's like that pins and needles thing? Yeah, like, dead arm. It's a little dead. Where's Yasha? Can I go around near Frumpkin and flank it? That's good. That's fine. And I hit it with Sentinel! At advantage! I rolled a 15. Six damage. Yeah. These are all my unarmed strikes, yeah? I hate that feeling! Yeah! What was it, like 79 points of damage you did in one round? Yeah, that was great. Did any of that trigger my sentinel? It didn't move out of my range at all? It got a natural 20. And that, I wouldn't have-- Okay. I already got my one reaction? I feel like that was before, though, the one reaction. The first one. With it being one more round, do I have a reaction? It's me and Yasha. I did on the round before. I feel like I have one more round but I don't think I did. Did you, though? Because it moved out of your range! But did Yasha? Oh, she ran out of range. Okay. I was thinking there was another round in between that. I'm going to lay into it. Wait. Wait. Caleb, you already went. You're going to give it to her? Okay. Then I'll lay into it. Sorry, I wanted to make sure someone was going to get Jester out. 21. That's nine points of damage. I'm going to go ahead and do Flurry of Blows for these next two. That's a natural 18. So five points of damage. The second one. That's not great. That's 11. Great, and that's seven points of damage. Aw, Frumpkin! Hey buddy. Well, if you hit all with everything at once, then the worst that can happen is that we have to fight two more things at the same time. LIAM; Well, Jester did necrotic, and I can obviously handle, well, I can handle evocation or-- So we have to do it all at once. Beau takes off her belt. I take off my belt, and I hold it up like a rally car racer girl. (silence) Three, two, one. (swishing) Come on. I still have this holy water, too. Which ones? Which portions? Yes! And enchantment. We put bowls-- no. All right, yes! Me and Fjord will stand by in case anything else drops out of the ceiling. Yasha, you want to take another point? Fighters and casters? This was a research facility for mages. They're super uppity about this shit, yeah. I pull off the belt again. One, two, three! On the other side. Beau's left behind going Come on! Pick it up, Caleb! Jester, you should always look out for yourself first, all right? I am waiting behind, motherfucker! I am in-between you and them, and I'm going come on, come on. Caleb, I love you, but we are missing out on other shit. I'm having extreme FOMO right now. Come on. No more ten minutes. I'm definitely going to write it down. It's the sword! It's the fucking sword! Yeah, "from ashes shall rise again?" Are we going to fight some guy who's going to chop off our legs? It talked about chopping off our legs! Yeah, the trophy was a warning. He lost his legs. I tried to write as much as I could. Maybe we should run. I was going to say, I don't think we've achieved anything. He wanted us to bring back any type of ancient research that we could find. But we could keep any of the spoils.
