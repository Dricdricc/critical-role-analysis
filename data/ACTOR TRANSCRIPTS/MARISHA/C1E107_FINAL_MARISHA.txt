A classic! That is the world's most famous Magic the Gathering card! Both? Both. The week after Gencon we will be streaming the panel that we did at GenCon. I feel like Brian is going to be in New York for Ashley's birthday right now. He flew out today. We've got our first Sagas of Sundry tattoo! It's beautiful and gorgeous. I love it. It's amazing. I have a little cake eraser. Do you want the cake eraser for the game? Hang on. Where is it? Where did I put it? Happy birthday! 107 episodes later. Has it been days? Feels like an eternity. I was angry. I was very angry, and maybe if we had this conversation yesterday, even, I might be yelling that to your face right now. But it's hard to be angry at bravery and selflessness. I mean, we've always had the problem of you having one too many ladies in your life, right? (laughs) It's hard to compete with a god. It's not your fault. I wouldn't take it back. You taught me how to take chances. (laughs) Can I ask you a question? What exactly was the deal that you made with the Raven Queen? Was it when we slew Vecna, or defeated him? I have a feeling semantics are becoming increasingly more important. Even if we found a way, you wouldn't take it. To reverse the deal. I'm not asking. I'm just confirming. It's fitting, really. You can protect that plane. I'll be here to protect this one. I mean, if these past few days have taught us anything, it's death isn't the end. I just don't want to forget. If Sprigg could forget the names of his party members that he died alongside-- he ran-- never mind. What's going to happen in a hundred or hundreds or even a thousand years? I don't want to forget this. What if there comes a day when I don't even recognize the name Vox Machina anymore? I can name a few. I'm grateful for you, and I always will be. And I'm grateful for any second that we have left. And I don't want to spend any more being angry at you. And I'm sorry that I was. (laughs) Of course not. Yeah. It's the weirdest thing, by the way, you being cold. I mean, it's just something to get used to. Yeah. I'm sorry. This head cold mixed with crying is bad. It's the worst! (raspy singing) What are they feeding you? Yes, I can. (unsure) Yes? And you roll 2d10 extra. Yeah, dope! Oh, that is an excellent question. How long do my speeches-- Said Katharine Hepburn. Okay. So can I double up on that? Oh. Yeah. Since my voice is completely shot, and I don't want to do a speech. I am going to do-- MARISHA and Of us swimming through the volcano, and then going underground and shielding ourselves, and then fighting! And then Grog's forging the trammels! (enthusiastic a cappella music) Hey, Pike? Could you also do one of those to Tary? Tell him we're all alive. This marker sucks balls! It's a bit away from Vasselheim, if I remember. I did see a tree, right, that was near the town? So yeah. Yeah, she was coming out of Thar Amphala. And she was coming out. She had both of her eyeballs back, and was like, "Ooh, it's "chilly." Bitch! Enjoying the winter snow. Two regular eyes! Why do you think she keeps coming back? (gasps) Oh no. TRAVIS, LAURA, and I don't know, maybe she made a deal similar to the deals we've made, but with Vecna. I mean, if gods can give us their blessing, why can't she have one? Yeah. A trail of black, sooty, bubbly goodness. Well, I have a tree. I can get us there. Boulder-Parchment-Shears. Oh! I hope not. How many does she get? (mafia-style voice) How many you got? Yeah. He's got that whole barbarian "knock me down, I get back up again" thing. That's why he would be a rogue/barbarian, I think! Hi! Maybe I should have found a tree less in the center of things. Yeah. I don't think any of us have them. Can we make our way to the shoreline? I stop everybody, saying, be careful. It looks like it could be a thousand feet, which is deceiving. A thousand feet is so long. Can I tell if the storm is coming or the storm has passed? I'm a motherfucking human barometer! Natural 20. Yeah. I'm really good at the check. Five miles. Well. I mean, we could. We can. I would rather save my 8th-level Animal Shapes in case we need to bail. I love Fenna in my salads. I would like to argue, he just disguised himself for a solid year. Wait, what's her name? Senth. It is the principle, but do we have time for principles? I mean, that's fine. I'd prefer a shitty ship if it's cheaper. She's got a high-ass insurance policy on this bitch. Oh boy. Santy? Shanty. MATT and Well, we have five miles ahead of us. Ugh. No. I'm going to go fix with that. Whatever. You know what I'm saying. (wind noises) After those initial winds, I take them and keep us going for a little bit. Actually, it should be only about half an hour, now! Well, then there's the Professor and Mary Ann. Yeah. Well, you may be the Professor. So maybe you're Mary Ann. Does that make me Ginger? Yeah. Actually, yeah. It's a 2nd-level spell. Gust of Wind. Santy is so wise. He sees the sea. Look at him. Santy of the Shanty seas sees the sea. Do you think Santy of the Shore Shanty sells sea shells? I see you're also skilled in interpretive dance. You're very good. Water Breathing! And Trinket. (poof) Keyleth uses Alter Self to give herself the gill hands. The webbed fingers again. That was cool. I'll be with Percy, more up front. It's like that game we all played when we were growing up. I can light up my flame hands. TRAVIS and But it's magic. I thought it doesn't matter? Do I see any-- (garbled) Do I see-- Are there any pockets other than the main pressure point that might be a smooth entry point? Okay. Yeah. All right, so it's hot water and gas coming up. If I theoretically wanted to do a Control Water spell and reverse the water inwards, could we go in through one of these tunnels? Through one of these fissures? I'm more thinking for all of us. I don't know how else we're going to get in. I could be a water elemental, though. If we want to wait a few minutes, I could do a Commune With Nature. I'm going to be like, underwater tea party! (glugging) And do a Commune With Nature for a little bit. I get three questions? I want to find any easy tunnels. Man-made tunnels that aren't going to bake us alive. Any dangerous creatures in the area. That's good. And the Anvil. Okay. All right, yeah, 300 feet. Are there any man-made tunnels that will grant us access into the volcano without burning us alive? And where are they? Are there any tunnels getting into the volcano? I'm afraid that 300 feet-- Within 300 feet, I can see the area. Yeah. Hostile creatures! Hostile creatures in the area. Dangerous hostile creatures. How many more adjectives can I throw in there? Do harm. Ill will. Earth elemental. I can make tunnels. Are we concerned if I start boring tunnels into the side of this that magma and pressure will start releasing out the side? Is my mantle helping with the heat? What if I'm controlling the currents? I didn't find anything. That's what I was saying. I'm afraid of the pressure. Our water breathing lasts for 24 hours. Scanlan, your burrowing. What means are you using for that? Touch√©. I have a feeling that's exactly what it is. It's going to suck working around that thing. Sorry. Scanlan? Okay. Can we tag-team this? Okay, what if you burrow and I push the water away-- Yeah, Control Water. I can push it away, and if you do that, then maybe we can all get in and then maybe I can throw up a wall! Or I can control the currents and suck us all right through down the top. As part of Control Water, I can reverse the currents. No, it's water and gas and pressure. I can also part water, like fucking Moses. That would be one of your top-level spells, yeah? I mean, we can still walk the perimeter if you want. We can walk the perimeter Investigation? Natural 20. (cheers) How big is the jet? Yeah, can Grog fit? Okay. Is it made out of stone? Can I call this earth? Can I call this rock? So Move Earth would not work? You are good at destroying structures. Can I transmute the rock into dirt or sand to give us a little more? I have Transmute Rock. Or we can let Grog go first. We're trying to go through an outward jet to this caved-in air pocket. Okay, okay. Let me Control Water with the current, and can I redirect the current up and around us to allow us to get in? Okay, yeah, I'm pushing the water, parting it, giving us a little. All right, push the water, Wall of Stone (boom). Oh! You punched a volcano! Oh, oxygen? Weirdo. Control Water lasts up to ten minutes, so if we want to commit to this, I can help jettison us there. Why? We decided early on that Wall of Stone was instantaneous. And permanent. Because it was in Pathfinder. The water? Just happens. Us breathing water is good for 24 hours. No, I'm going to Control Water, and I'm going to jettison us with the current. Yeah. It'll be like Lazy River. For the whole duration? But I haven't done that because I've already jettisoned this one water, and then now I'm trying to use the remaining-- Over lava? So bad at it. Find the Path? But I think I have to have seen the object before. It would also burn my last 6th-level spell. Why does this always happen to us? Is it the same foot? Yeah! Wait, we're waterboarding ourselves? And I use my mantle, which I constantly forget triples my jump distance. That's not great. Acrobatics? Oh, that's better. That's better. 15. Earth elementals. Volcanic earth elementals. Dope. 34. I loved it so much. It's like 2006's The Core! Jurassic Park rules. Do what? Oh, your sneak attack? Might still be able to do it. I know it takes half damage, I think, to non-magical physical attacks. He's got heavily armored skin. Other than that, I don't know. 13. Did you roll a one? Sneak attack that bitch! 11 points. That's not bad, yeah. Oh shit. Going planetar. Is this True Polymorph? Generally, it'll say. Because Shapechange, you absorb your armor. You know those first generation Black Lotus cards can go for $30,000, depending on their condition. Yep. Banned cards. Okay. The battlefield changed a little bit, so instead, can I do a Chain Lightning out of the staff and hit all three of those motherfuckers? Starting with the big mama and branching off to the two other dudes? Yeah, I do that. That's 10d8. And it's a dex? I think it's a dexterity saving throw, and it's 10d8. One, two, three, four, five. Does anyone want to lend me their d8s? You have five there? Okay, okay, okay. A little Ashley Johnson "Okay, okay, okay." LIAM and Okay, I get to reroll ones because I'm a badass. Yes, I did. That was right, right? 17 plus another four is 21, plus another five is 26, plus another four is 30, plus another six is 36, plus another 16 total. So 36 plus 16 is 52. Oh, 52 plus another seven, so 59. Grog gets vomited up in front of me? You smell like shit. Big Grog! He's swole. I'm picturing Grog being like (intense grunting, careful inching, intense grunting). He's Mr. November. Oh yeah! Use mine! They just did very good. It's so hot. Descended around. Copy that. Oh yeah. Pass the jug. No, you do. No. True Polymorph, you absorb your gear and you don't benefit from it, but it doesn't say anything about you not benefiting from-- Correct. The gear melds into the new form. The creature cannot activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment, but it doesn't say anything else other than equipment. You're very welcome. Do the two twins want to scout? So is it "the Allhammer lies beyond"? "Is dark"? Here the Crafter's Hall remains dark, the Allhammer-- Watch over us. Something about watching over us. Yeah, validate free parking. I'll take the carpet or whatever. What? What does it say? So it's quite literally a family business. We're closed, retired. Bars in front of it. Can you hear the ocean? It seems like it's just closed. Go Strongjaw, go! He's throwing you a bone. Me. Oh, I'm just-- big strides. Big strides! I try to look more normal while still taking big strides. No? One of these days you're going to break someone's nose. Speak in Morse code. Grog. Do you trust this? The reliefs, the people in the wall? Okay. It was a hypothetical question. Just to be safe, I cast Freedom of Movement on Grog. Just in case. So loose. So free. So much movement. Yeah, I'll be with Vex. Wait, is that ding to your saving throws considered a curse? And you said there were three warriors? While he does that, I stand in the middle. Are the three warriors triangulated, if you were to draw out a triangle between them? In the same shape? And one open hand. Is there anything on the floor? Any patterns on the floor? 13. But what to smelt in? Don't destroy their faces! Happy birthday!
