And I went to college there, so I'm going to be finding my old homies and getting drunk. I went to the performing arts school, and we did make football t-shirts, because we thought it was funny, as our performing arts shirts. Yeah. Cool story, bro. A great way to celebrate. I'll be filing an extension, like everybody else. It's an off-the-menu item. You're now on the Homeland Security list. Oh, I thought this was scripted. Yeah, so don't yell at them. Don't be like, "Bullshit!" What do the tents look like? Do they look like military encampment tents, or refugee tents? I couldn't help with that today. What time is it? Mist form got us here. Maybe they're friends. I wonder why everything he says is creepy. That's some cartel shit right there. You mean, you've never thrown a party? Well, all right, why don't we just walk around and talk to these people? Maybe they're not even interested in being transported. Let's just find some citizens around. We should probably do that as well, not like a band of thieves. Bandits. Oh my god. (gasps) Drez! Yeah! He protected us, he's a magic user. Wait, was he the guy that we stole from, kind of? It's been like three years. And that was where we fought the golem! And he's with us. So-- He's not with them. LAURA. He's different than the other guys, see? He's got a beard. Keyleth goes up to Simon. How old are you now? You've grown up so well. And I just give him a big hug. Keyleth does a little wind gust and goes (poof). What's your current destination? And what made you camp out here? Percy actually has family who's in charge there. Can they account for 70 extra people in Whitestone? Right. It hasn't been touched by dragons yet. Yet. And what is necessarily stopping you from at least sending a handful of women and children ahead? Families that don't need to be nomadic. They'd be there in an instant. No one's returned who's come back? Can we speak to them? Do you know your way around the Frostweald at all? No. Are we camping the rest of the night? Question. Question. Can I do my Transport via Plants as a ritual cast to not burn a slot level? That's what I thought. That's what I thought. Okay. Keyleth spends the rest of the evening burning up my remainder spell slots to do curing on those who need it. We'll write a letter. Ooh, that's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah, could task someone to find her immediately and then, as soon as she gets the message, she'll beam to us. Well, I start attending to the children first. Well, remember, we were able to get about 25 or so people through last time with the spell. Okay. Well, you know, you didn't have to tell them that now. Could've just let it be a surprise. Is it? Okay, that's good to know. What didn't you see? Tell me what you didn't see. What? What do you mean? Are there trees here? I thought we were on the edge of a forest. How fucking far are trees? I just need a tree to fit people through. I need a person-width tree. That's a nice morning hike. That's doable. There we go. We form the line, the ranks. Go, go, go, go! I turn to him and I go, high five! Okay. So you're a necromancer. Like natural elements? Oh, shut up, Drez. Wait, he might. Look, Master Quall. Finish what you were saying first. Well, we were headed towards-- How is what we're seeking less important than where we're seeking it? I'm really confused. Does he look like the man capable of going and finding things? He's trying to send us back into his own god damn basement to get his own shit. Hi, Pike! And you remember Drez. I'm curious if you could be more beneficial in paying us with information. With knowledge. Are you familiar with a sphinx named Osysa? Resides up-- No? Are you familiar with any other sphinxes that reside in this area? Do you know the address? Well, you do seem to be a master of items. We are looking for certain special Vestiges. We're not sure yet. We thought maybe he could help us find them, but maybe you could be of a similar service. Sure. Wait, what? What? Hey, what might this item be called, Sir Quall? The Hunk of Quall. Did we have any other information of where he is in the Frostweald or do we just know Frostweald? Past the Frostweald? That's so cool! You're a beast! Sorry. I do. Oh my gosh, are we walking? We haven't walked anywhere in so long. It's like we're level three again. I paint pictures in the clouds as we go. This never happens. Are there any trees nearby? How much further do we have, do you think? Oh, you have to show her the marble floors. Keyleth pops her head out into the hallway. Did I hear something about working? Are you working? Oh, that's fantastic. I might join you. I can't sleep, so, yes. I join Percy and help him. Hey, Percy, what are you trying to make? Do I assist him at all? I pick one up off the table and I say, hey Vex! (whoosh) I like that game. It's my new favorite game. We have more chickens. Isn't it, Pike? Go, go, go! Guys, this is the best brunch we've ever done. That was great. Thank you for that, Scanlan. Yeah, so, question, before we leave, you guys-- Do we want to travel via Wind Walk, or are we okay? Because I can save my strength. Okay. All right. Thank you. That's true. Keyleth takes a second to meditate on the previous time that we were here in the Frostweald, and I cast Find the Path. 6th-level spell. Which gives me the most direct, shortest route as long as I'm on the same plane existence of where I'm going, if I have a vague idea of where I'm going. We're trying to get to the Stormcrest Mountains through, but we're also looking for the band of orcs travelling. But we're in the Frostweald, right? Is the Frostweald considered on a different plane? Well, I can find us the shortest, most direct route to the Stormcrest Mountains. Right. Stormcrest Mountains. But just because I can see them doesn't necessarily mean we're going to find the most direct path, shortest direct path towards it. Right? Or is this a waste of a spell and I should just do something else? I don't know it, so it fails. That's why I was trying to do Stormcrest Mountains, but apparently that's not specific enough. I'll do something else. 18. It's a big obelisk? Are there any birds or anything like that around? I'll come with you, Grog. 11. Religion? Nine. What? Hell no. I know that one. But you should do it, Grog. I can't do it, just because of my elven abilities. It's our saliva, it doesn't work the same way. But you should try it, it's crazy. Upon him seeing that, I pull out my Hunk of Quall and see if it lights up. Can I move a little bit closer to the obelisk? I do Control Water. Can I do Control Water and clear away all the snow from around it? Son of a bitch. I pull out the hunk of Quall again. Anything? Hold it closer to the symbol. Can I do a nature check? Sorry. Elven, Sylvan, Druidic, Primordial. Oh, okay. A name is earned? Can I do a nature check? To see if I can see any signs of basilisks? 21. Oh, it was made by a creature, it looks like? Fuck. Shit. I'm standing right in the middle of them. Got the fucking shittiest initiative rolls. Pike. Damn! Yes! Yup. Uh-huh. Gamblers! How many are left? Two? I am remembering what the basilisks did last time, and I've only done this once before, and am going to go... I'm looking down and transforming into a giant scorpion. Yeah, they have blindsight. It means they don't use their eyes to see things. They have blindsight. (clicking pincers) Where are they? The two are kind of in the middle there? Okay. I'm going to move in between them and I'm going to do a multiattack on both of those. I'll start on the one that Grog's not focusing on. So I have three attacks, two with my claws and one with my stinger. No, why? No, I didn't. I have blindsight as a scorpion. No, I turned into a scorpion. I said I looked down, but once I'm a scorpion, I have blindsight. Well, I said I looked down and turned into a scorpion to try and avoid it, so... I mean, I did, yeah. That's the whole reason I did the scorpion. Miss. Six misses, for the first one. That's a three, it misses again. Nope, that's a two. Last one is an eight, plus a four... So that's 12. Probably still nothing. That legitimately made me spit my fucking coffee in my face. All three? Okay, I wish I remembered them. Do you want me to reroll all three? Jeez, I'm going to tweet at you later about this. These are just straight, they don't have disadvantage? First attack, 14. Second attack was a natural 18, so 22. For the tail, 16. That's not very much. Four damage for the claw attack, and then for the sting, oh my god. Three damage, and they have to take a constitution saving throw. 12. Fuck. Okay, they take 4d10 poison, and on a failed save, they take half as much. Thanks guys! Wow, these are fucking horrifying rolls. Six, seven, eight, nine, plus seven is 16 points of poison damage. No, that is halved. Sorry, it was eight damage. Eight damage. Grog and I can take it anyway. That hits. So that was 21? I know, and I keep looking at you. Katy Perry style. We are fucking eating it on rolls tonight. Subterranean tunnel? Can I use my blindsight tremorsense to see if I can feel how far away they are? Sounds like a lot of them? I'm going to drop my scorpion form. The things you say, Scanlan. I'm just going to do a Wall of Stone, flat over the area with the holes. It'll last until they bust out of it, so we either keep moving or figure out where we're going from here. It has writing in Elvish in it. It says, a name is earned, in Elvish. I say Ioun in Elvish. Ioun! Knowledge! I'm going in the triangle hole! Osysa! Sphinx! What's in the hole? I say, earned! Did they give up? A matching color? 14. I hold up the Hunk of Quall. I didn't bring it because everyone said not to learn that spell. He said to learn something else because it wasn't going to be useful. No, you said to learn something, it was at the beginning of the day! Okay. I thought you were saying to pick something else because it wouldn't be handy. But I take it back, and I'll use it now if you want. I'm so confused. Is it me tonight? Do I need sleep? What am I missing? I can keep it. I never unlearned it! It's been there the whole time! I didn't use it. It's not like I used a 6th-level spell. Look, guys! Find the Path! That way! That beam of light! That she pointed out. Am I doing this wrong? What, that one? I have it marked now. I have a pin in it. Right, that counts? Fucking handy, that one is. Totally a great 6th-level spell I'm going to use all the time going forward. What? I've got it in my head now. Well, you have a great story now. I could... I have Conjure Woodland Beings in my back pocket today, so I could conjure you a little posse to escort you. Have a little posse. I don't know. That's something else that I haven't done, ever. That always works so well. We did say we were going to take care of the orcs. We did promise that. Got to enjoy it now.
