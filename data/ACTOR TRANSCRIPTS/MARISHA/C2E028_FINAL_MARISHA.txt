We made announcements online. We're trying to get better at spercing our announcements out through other things. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We mentioned about going and looking to see if a Tasker would be up to it. There were the Taskers, and there were the other group of hired workers. Is it like, the Grudge Gang is an umbrella corporation of the Taskers, or vice versa? I mean, just to play devil's advocate here, is it an issue if we get a hired mercenary group to kill another underground faction in their same town? Is that-- Yeah, I don't know, it's a weird political issue, hiring someone in the system. Well this Ophelia wants us to kill everyone in the motherfucking house. I think she's right. Plus, who knows who could arrive in the time that we're gone. I think we need to be prepared for all of them. I miss Jester's healing spells. I mean, look. The solution might end up solving itself, who know who in this town is even willing to go up against the Iron Shepherds. Smoke them out! That's actually not a bad idea, now that I think about it, though. (laughing) Sorry, I'm just imagining an infiltration with the spider, like that's feasible. Go, Frumpkin, go! Put him in his boot! Sure. Literally anything is better than a spider, though. For that. I just want to point that out. I mean they've got a lot of eyes, I get that, but I think in terms of a movement situation, spiders aren't the best. Shady Debaters! Laura, make a Shady Debaters debate team shirt! I've got a little bit of funds. If you go under equipment-- Same. I have one. Healing potions. Ooh! That does help! Those are good! Those are great! I'm into it, yeah. I like the idea of getting some sort of fighter, especially if Nila can maybe take out that outer onion layer with the lightning. We should have found a better analogy. I like that. Ophelia mentioned that, yeah. Aid. I oddly trust that more than hiring someone from The Grudge Gang. I feel like The Grudge Gang might have ties to the Iron Shepherds or at least an inside man. I've seen some pretty badass priests in my day. Did we hear what god they worship? I feel like if it was one of the accepted gods of The Empire, you wouldn't have to hide out in the woods. I'm kind of into this idea. The ones in captivity? Probably pretty unstable. Being controlled. They arguably have their shit together way more than the three of us do. Yeah, especially Jester. What time is it? You said it's four hours there. Brisk power walk there, that'll get us there right around sunset. Talk to people. Power walk back, should get us there back-- Yes, in time for Saturday Night Live. (laughter) Great. We might be able to go and get back in time, is what I'm saying, and still be able to attack tonight. If it is a total bust, then that sucks. That's true. All right, let's go. Are you good with that, Nila? You seem apprehensive. Well, shall we? Let's power walk. You know like grandmas in malls, like around Christmas time. Yes. That's still reliance. Nott, do you want the middle? Fuh-wumpkin. That was almost great. (whispering) Yes, yes. We can't see over the wall? I think this is the place. We buried him with it. But that's a good idea. This is what I used to do to hop fences back in the day. I look for a few broken-down branches that might be my height. A handful. Ten. Before I do anything with it, I take it over to Nila. Nila, have you seen any type of blight on a plant like this before? Do you know what this is? It's cold, feel it. I take the branches and I try to lay them down over the vines a little bit and give a little less thorny of a ramp. Look, they hook all on their own, that's pretty good. Thank you, look at that! On the tombstones that are around, do I recognize any of the language, or can I tell how old some of these gravesites are? 21. Until recently, okay. What's the name? Tyriel Castala? Casala. Wait, back up a second. Are you Mr. Clay? Caduceus Clay. Is that Caduceus with a K, or a C? Okay. Caleb and I will share one and I hand the other to Nila. A few great tragedies. Well, the first one is, I think, it's time for Caleb to have another bath. It's been a little bit. Being without a shower has been a bit of a tragedy. No. I didn't want to open the gate like that. That's why we're here. Do you only gauge time in seasons? That's fair. We're drinking dead people tea? Very true. But you're cultivating dead people for good tea? Yeah, okay. Yeah. That's a good point. Okay, well, beyond helping our recently passed friend, how do you feel about helping people who are on the edge of life and death in captivity? And they might not have long to live. We're working on it. Dead bramble. Dead mushrooms. Dead moss. Is there a watering system, or can you put it on a timer if you're not going to be here? Maybe we're in a rush; maybe after. Well, we came to you. You don't have a particular penchant or sympathy towards people who eat babies, do you? Was that you saying you're willing to kill people and put them in the ground to make compost?! Oh man, you're seeing me at a relatively calm moment, actually. Don't overthink it. (whispering) Fungal armor! Your blood-- you got some to spare. You can get more of it. That's how your body works. Hey Clay? Did you bury Tyriel Colsala here? Yeah, him. That's what I said. (accented) Casala? Were you around when you buried him? All right. Power walking? We might be all right. Yeah, no. The fuck?! I'm going to try to catch it. Okay, I roll a d10. A ten! Plus my monk level, right? Which is five. 1d10 plus eight. Oh, it's my monk level plus my proficiency bonus, so no damage. And third of all, that was a killing blow! You could fucking kill me! I'm keeping this bolt, this is mine now. I rip the other one out. Yeah! I put that, and I'm keeping this one, too! Don't infect me! Okay, this shit's dope. That wasn't for you. Never mind. I think we were going to go straight there. It's on the way. It's on the way. I say we at least stop by and scout it. How long after dusk has it been? Are you being facetious? I can't tell. How many seasons old are you? 25. I'm still afraid if we roll into Shadycreek-- once again, just pointing out what we are two firbolgs, a goblin, and then some kind of acceptable-looking people and someone with a reputation. Well, by society's standards. Look, come on! I'm just saying, we will draw attention to ourselves, and then we might go around asking people to kill the Iron Shepherds, and that might draw more attention to ourselves in a town that it feels the Iron Shepherds kind of run. Or at least have a better foothold in it than we do. Do you know Ophelia, Clay? Sorry, you just had a face like you recognized. Okay. Anyone in particular feel super strongly about going and getting more help? Should we put it to a vote? What does your smell bag say? Do we go and we get more people or do we go to the house? Make a smell check. I mean, she's so convincing. All right, new plan. We split the party! Half go to the house, the other half go look for more help and then we meet you. Watch. All right. Let's go to the house. Yeah. Let's go. We're wasting time just talking. We'll go look. Shit. I've got fireworks. He isn't? Let's go. 12. Can you bring him back? I kind of want that arrow. Do you have an illusion that you can do that? It's a good idea. Maybe we should've done that to begin with. All right. Who votes for more muscle? Let's put it to a vote. How tall is the wall? How would I be able to get on the wall? Are we walking the perimeter? If we're doing a perimeter walk, I want to look and see if there are any branches and trees that might be growing close to the wall, that I could-- Yeah, we've got to do both at the same time, ideally. There's got to be a team one and a team two on the guy. I've got my throwing darts, but they're not super great. Also, sometimes maybe it's just a stormy night here in the forest. Okay, here's what I'm going to propose. We split up three on one guy, three on the other. We'll do the plan that worked when we were doing it on kids, and we didn't know we were doing it on kids. Me and you can throw up a bottle rocket. That will be the signal. We attack both of the guys at the same time, two different sides. But if it's loud, and they're both dead afterwards. We want to murder everyone inside and rescue the people who are trapped. All right, let's split up, take these guys out. Jesus! We wait an hour and get into position. We watch the passing shadows in front of the windows. No, I'm right next to you. Yeah. I was just trying to move things along. Yeah, we'll wait. We'll just wait an hour. That's what I was thinking, at least to get into place, and then put it back on. Okay. Until the next shift change. I could use a short rest anyway. I think so. Can I take a short rest? And we watch. And we solidify our plan? How are you lifting that? Have they done a guard shift yet? Go Charlotte, go! You're radiant! How big is that spider? That looks like a three hit point spider. That's arguably terrifying, I'll give it to you. I was a little wrong, just a little. I'm not terrified of it, I'm just saying it could be terrifying. Hi, Frumpkin. One firbolg each. We'll take the old one. Table and Table. I don't know I can only hear muffles. Choice words. I think they're talking about you, though. Oh yeah. Death is weird, am I right? How tall are you? Would you be willing to give me a boost up that wall? Copy. Also, the thing I was looking at, our version of the smell bag. It's like this artifact that we got from an assassin that lets you look into the creation of space and time and the universe. Yeah Anyway. How far does your Message work? So we wouldn't be out a Message range of each other. When I get up there and grab him, I'm going to bash his head in and I'm going to throw him down, and if he's still alive, you get him. I was figuring I would be on her shoulders and we would suck up against the wall. We'll see, yeah. Right underneath him. Keg. LIAM and But not as short as Nott. Pass it along! Makeshift harpoon? That's pretty cool. Let's just do this. Come on. We're going to wait for our guys to pace-- Uh-huh, with Pass Without a Trace. They're here. Go, Pass without a Trace! We're going. I'm on her shoulders, I'm up against this fucking wall! You're doing this, I'm going to try and (grunt)-- I want to wait until right after he passes, and then I want to do some ninja stuff. I do. That's true. Mmm. Then that gives me a 20 total. Okay, 20. I cursed you! Woo! He's held? As soon that I see that he's held, I am going to jump up and try and grab him by the pants and bash his head in and then throw him down. Okay. Just a straight attack? Okay. 16? No, sorry, 15? Aw, I rolled a one. Plus two, plus four. Six damage. I go Nila, now! I will finish my attack right as she whacks her staff. I'm going to let go and try and time it to where I land on the staff with her. Mm-hmm, 23. 23. That's much better. Eight plus four, so 12 damage. I do the same thing. I slip into the guard uniform. Would you mind giving me another boost real quick? I look over at Deuce and give a nod. I can unlock the front entrance for you guys. Do we want to go front entrance/back entrance? Yeah, make sure we get the gold out of our dude's pockets, you're right there on the ground. Is there anything on the dude's armor that I put on? Investigation. SUMALEE and I say Meet at the front gate. I think you still have Pass Without a Trace on. Lasts for like ten minutes, I think. Lasts for an hour? SUMALEE and I signal to Deuce. I don't know what else to call you. Clay. Hey, look at the windows, too. Okay, I'm going to slowly start pacing around towards the front. I'm also going to look into the windows. Do I see anything from my vantage point? Natural 20! Thanks, Gil! Coast looks clear. I don't know why I did this with my fingers. It's within 30 feet of her, so yeah, I think she should be good? But I think you have to cast it on the people within 30 feet of you. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet? We don't see that? I didn't see that. Kill it! Kill it! Yeah, she did. With the trapdoor, yep. Is it Phil? I take back mocking you for your choice. I thought it was going to blow our cover. I do another check to see if I see any movement upstairs. I just want to make sure. By the window. All right. The rogue did blow it! Don't die! Also 21. I'm actually going ahead and roll my d8 with this as well. Plus seven, 29. Sorry, 28. Wait, who was a 12? You? Okay. I want to look at the window. Do I see that figure I just saw? Does it seem like the pots and pans got that figure's attention and they're hastily moving? Okay, where am I? I'm over there. Okay, I am going to-- do I try and make a distraction or run? I'm going to light one of those firecrackers again, and I'm going to toss it this direction towards the front of the door. Natural 20! I want to try and aim it to where it sounds like there's a commotion happening at this front door to draw people this way and not at the back. I'm assuming that was my action? Okay, I'm going to use my movement to just haul ass towards these guys. Yeah! Okay. I'm coming into you, though. I'm coming into you guys. Okay. Have I heard my cherry bomb go off? Oh, what? Amazing. Okay. I'm going to move my full speed, my 40 feet. Does it get me in? 14. Okay. I'm going to use-- no. I'm going to use my action to move again, to dash. Nope, I'm going to go that way. Okay. I don't want to peek around the wall; I want to ninja dash around, and I want to get up against the wall, peek, and look for anyone who might be coming around that hall. As I ran by, I went Psst! To Caleb, to let him know that I was here and going that way. I'm like I'm going to watch this way. Watch for me! Let's hope this works the way I have in my head. Mother's vengeance. Fuck you, Phil! (singing) I can feel it coming in the air tonight. Well, she's prone. As Nott comes around the corner, I'm just going to go Hey! Psst! (shushing) "Hey, big guy!" Is her AC down? Barbarian, 14? Ooh! Yaaas, girl, yaaas! Okay, where's Nott? Nott's over here? I'm going to run around. That was my 40 feet? I have 40. No, I'm getting to Nott. I go-- (laughing) Holy shit! I did that. What? Do you need to get to the thing? To pick the lock? Okay! I think I know where it is. I scoop up Nott. Slap fight! But then we have to wait until your turn. Or I could just scoop you up and drag you a little bit and go that direction! I'm going to do that! I'm going to dash. Come here! I'm going to spend-- do I want to do this? Yeah, I'm going to spend a ki point to do that thing that makes me move fast. Step of the Wind, yes. Can I open the door? Is there enough room? Locked. Okay, it's through this door, though! Because I ran by it earlier. I remember from Nila describing it. I took really detailed notes. Because she has Yasha's-- Come on firbolg! No, Nott, no! Advantage on strength and what? No, this is great. You're great. I did. You have such bad luck with this. This is how Molly died! You trying to pick locks! Okay, okay, okay. Oh! Okay, it's me. Shit! What's the quickest way through? Can I get through everybody and go this way? Yeah, I'm going to do that. Excuse, me. Sorry. Pardon me. Excuse me. Okay, can I step back a few feet? I don't want to go that full movement, maybe on top of the table. Can I get on top of the table? That's cool. I want to gauge it right over Keg's shoulders and throw two darts. Over top of her shoulders to the giant barbarian behind her? Hopefully? Or ricochet, whatever's the coolest. Yeah! Okay, first one 17? 13 on the higher one. That's a 20. What do these do? These do a d8 damage? These do monk or do these--? These are the-- no, these still do 1d4, right? So the first one is crap. That's five damage. My second one. 21. Ooh, that's better. Eight damage. I just give a wink. Fucking fly! Yes! Beau turns around to Caleb and goes Damn, Caleb. Do it! Yes! Okay, one more. Do a second one. That's better? I'm going to watch this front door and make sure no one else comes down the steps. No, here. Yeah, get the sword. Sword in the haversack. What? No, I'm putting it in the haversack. It's Yasha's sword. From the underside. It'll hurt them. I'm still watching this front area. Will you show off your shirt? It's a little squishy. I like this guy a lot. Do you really like pink more than purple? Like, as a person? I can't tell if you're lying to me or not. How many? So he's either still upstairs or deeper, further. Or he's not here at all and he's at the bar that he likes to hang out at-- Called The Trench. Fuck you. So close, I was almost there. We have the trapdoor open though, right? How about, everyone get ready? You do. So do I. We still look like guards. Why don't we bring this guard up here to us? Why don't we handle this guard first, and I go, here, lift up the gate. Lift up the trapdoor. You're going down? You don't want to bring him up? Okay. I'm going to go down with Clay, but just at the stairs, since I also look like a guard. Yep. Does he have advantage? I tap on the bars with my staff, and I go Wait man, Phil, there's something wrong with Phil, I think he really needs our help. Fucking Phil, am I right? I'm not gambling for torturing children. 21! I hate it when Phil ruins torturing hour. I step to the side, let him unlock the door. I go Just follow him. Go! First, you celebrate. Oh, I don't think I hit. 12. This fucker's not here. That's cocked. Yeah, sorry. It was almost good. That's pretty good. It's three. Plus your wisdom modifier. While this is happening, can I come and watch this corridor? I'm going to suck up against this wall and look to make sure no one is coming around that hall while this is happening. Yeah, actually, we both look like soldiers. We block this corridor, looking like soldiers. Just backs to that corridor in this room. Yup, like we're watching-- guarding this room together. You're supposed to be good at this! Did you just roll two ones in a row? Well, we relied on your mate here. Couldn't have done it without her. Now, if I was you, I'd run. You have a child with you. You need to get him out of here. He's suffered enough. We've got it from here. We wouldn't have gotten this far without you. We'll see you later. We'll find you again, Nila. Sumalee! One red Nila feather. That was so amazing! You were the softness that we needed-- --in our group. Desperately. She was the Charmin bear, and we were like... rocks? I don't know, that's all I got. That's true! Passing the torch! Yeah.
