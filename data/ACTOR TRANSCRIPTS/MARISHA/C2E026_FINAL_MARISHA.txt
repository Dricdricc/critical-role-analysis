Sorry, Laura. Darling, something magical is happening. Our boy, the magical light that will illuminate the universe, will join us soon. Travis, dear, your stallion is galloping to earth, humanity must welcome him with loving arms. It's Bailey. I feel nothing but the sweet nectar of Mother Nature coursing through me. My love radiates like luminescent rainbows that will create a new life this day. It is done. (laughter) Does one need push for the summer to shine down its radiance upon us? No, we merely bask in its glory. Lo, my baby is perfection. You are a miracle baby. I love you. It's Bailey. That was handed to us two minutes ago. I think I have some pocket bacon still. Yeah. It's a little moldy. Okay. Where's Yasha? She's gone too. Yeah, but-- Falchion? Right, but his holster thingy. Right? Didn't he have a holster thing, or did I just imagine that because he's Texblade? It's not right. Are there trees nearby? That was very specific for an "uh" to come before it. Can I see if I see any grass that's been laid down, like a direction that there might be people who have walked through? That's a natural one. First roll in the new studio, it's a one! We know nature is better at everything. So it's impossible to tell if it's the same one? Well, that's more narrow. When it was going on the road, was it going towards the direction we were going, or were we following it? Yeah. She also has a big old crushie on Fjord. Why couldn't we hear anything? Censored video game blood. And that blood was far away from our camp. Maybe they were just triggered by a sound that they heard, and they went to go investigate it. Four D batteries. It's very obnoxious. I'm following Molly. As I follow Molly, I turn to Nott and Caleb, and I say, just stay back for a second. Back us up if we need it. I flank. Stealth. Man. This feels like last game. 12. Yeah, do you want--? Pick a dice bag. As I make eye-contact, I'm like, Aw, shit. Was it the blue? Was I too tall? I would just like a little bit of feedback so I know how to perfect it later. Yeah. Fuck. All right. You've got great eyesight. I'm complimenting you. What's your name? What's your fucking name?! Molly, ask her. We're at an impasse. How's your day? (laughter) Sorry. Happens sometimes. What's the Run? No, really, what's the Run? That sounds fascinating. Oh, shit. We should have thought about that. I don't know your street lingo. Yeah, you're right again. And by "robbed," he means half of our party got abducted. "Robbed?" That's such a light way of putting it. We were actually headed to the Run. It does sound pretty cool. (shouts) Yeah, hey, Caleb! Nott! We're a little on edge, considering family-- I mean, party members-- were abducted. Wait, I thought you were coming from Shadycreek Run. Ah. But you've been there. It's named Shady. Molly doesn't speak for me. I feel like I can hold my own pretty well. I might actually be the only tough one here. Shit. Well, they're the only people I've had in my life since my father, so. Parents. Plus, we had to go up there anyway. Beau. That's nice. You said slavers? That's why we clearly got off to a great start. Sorry. I'm also trying to work on the manners thing. The guy who actually got taken from us was helping me. If Shadycreek Run is full of a bunch of criminals, and you said you lived there for a while, what were you doing there? Well that's pretty clear. It's like a horror film. The more you leave it up to your imagination, the worse it is. How about equal assurance that you don't fuck us over? And you don't fuck us, and we don't fuck you. Unless, like... you know... It's been a while. They're mobsters! Weird question have I heard about this group, considering my background? History. My history changed here recently. That's my second natural one in a row. I'm going to get rid of this one. Where's Laura with her dice jail when you need it? That's an 18 that I just rolled now. Okay. Do you know all of the members of this Iron Brigade-- what's it called? Iron Shepherds. Iron Shep. For sure. (laughter) One of them wouldn't happen to be named Ophelia Mardun, were they? No? Okay. That's the woman we have to find for The Gentleman. That's part of the reason we're going. Mardun. Rival mob gangs! Wait, what about me? Aw, cool. Real cool, Nott. Sam take one side. Sponsored by Wyrmwood. I agree. Jester's? Well, hang on. I open the haversack. And start trying to shove as much as I can in the haversack. I'm trying to-- Just wait, don't move. What about a tent? Can I shove a tent in here? Yeah, let's strap it to a horse. No I think we can... I think the shield and-- We put a tent in there and if we want to attach another tent to the back. So we're leaving behind a horse and a cart. Is there a town coming up? Or some place where we can quickly sell the horse and cart? We lead the horse to water, we force it to drink, we give it some food, hope it lives. Maybe come back and find it. We hang a sign on it. "Free horse." Poop. Yep. Keg should lead. I'll keep watch. Hopefully there are no more ones hiding in there. 18. What's the faster route? 12. We're on horses, let's just cut through. This is a donkey. I say we go through the woods, but you're the leader. Sorry, around. The shortcut. Yes. Do you want to send in Frumpkin, bird Frumpkin, see what he finds? Sleep in it, is what we're thinking. All right, let's keep going. As we go by it-- we're headed that way, right? Should we check it out and see if there's anything good? I'll take a couple torches. Nah, I'm good. 16. I'm still outside on my horse. So I'm going to ride around to the back of the house, and see if I see anything. I'm going to jump off my horse and get on the ground and feel the ground. Do I feel any vibrations? I-- were you going to keep going? I say Get off the ground! And I run, and I'm going to try and parkour up onto the roof of this thing. Is there a roof to be got upon? No, I jumped off my horse to feel the ground. I'll get on my horse and head for the tree line with everyone else. I'm going to take-- as I get closer to the tree line-- how far away am I? Okay, I'm going to take my horse and I'm going to whip it around the opposite way, going away from us, and I'm going to give it a good kick and jump off of it. And head towards the tree line with everybody else. I'm going to head it away from us. Come on, WC, come on! Water Closet! Yeah, she did that goblins thing with us. 20. You're also three? Okay. So I have this one in front of me. Oh, man. Oh my god. No, I'm going to go for this one here. I should have enough speed to clear it, 40 feet. Pop, pop. Okay, so first attack. 15? Okay. I'm going to spend a ki point to stun this thing, and hopefully it doesn't save again. It's stunned! Finally! Oh, right. Oh god, I rolled a one in damage. So that's plus four, five damage. I'm so nervous. Yeah. Then second strike. That's a natural 14, so I'm pretty sure that hits, plus seven, so 21. Ooh, that's an eight; it's the total other end of the spectrum. I keep getting there. Sorry, my brain is all over the place. 12 damage. Okay, and then I am going to spend another ki point and do extract aspects. Three things, okay. What is its dexterity modifier, or its dexterity saving throw? Okay. Sorry. Dex zero. What is its constitution saving throw? Does it have any vulnerabilities? Okay. I still have a bonus attack, right? 13. Oh, that's right! That's even worse. Yeah. I yell to everybody and be like These guys don't seem very quick and shifty! Not too dex-y or anything. They seem clumsy as fuck. It has shitty dexterity. Clink! Take her staff and clink weapons. Rest in peace, Water Closet. Dex saves? That's a natural one. Hey, Crapper! Yes! Aw, I hate licorice. (groaning) Why is that taste in my mouth? That's weird. (panting) I'm going to turn to this guy and I'm going to lay into him. So that means, do I get three attacks? Base attacks? (hits) First one! And advantage on dex saves. 15. That is... nine damage. Nine! Second one. Ooh. Yeah, yeah. that's 16. And that is... 11 damage. That's a natural 14. Okay. Seven damage. Yep and I'm going to spend a ki point again to do flurry of blows and get two more attacks. Mm. One's a natural 19, the other's a two. Aw, yeah! 11 damage. No, ten damage. Sorry. Is he dead? Is he dead? (cheering) (hits) Oh, movement! Oh my god. I am going to make my way behind this guy... if I can. Yeah. Yeah. (singing) Singing in the rain. Yes. It's a different color palette? Color palette swaps. Okay. Miss. First attack. 14. Wait, no, 13. Sorry, my math is wonky today. That doesn't hit, does it? Second attack. That hits, that's 18. That is-- what did I roll on that one? I forgot. I don't know what it was. Sorry, 15 damage for the first one. Yes. As I see Keg bash it in a little bit of its insect armor, I take my staff and I get up under its exoskeleton and I start prying it off and I punch it to death. Does anybody have a Wet-Nap? Please check on Water Closet! Check Water Closet. Oh, he's very dead. He came up with this one; they were a package deal. We have three horses, and there's five of us. Can we double up? Nott doubles up with Caleb. Nott, team up with Caleb. Can me and Molly team up? Okay. I have a potion. Yeah, her notebook might even be-- Oh, it might be in the locker then. It was in battle mode, did you notice? New toys. 12. What about their acidic venom situation, their venom sacs? Like I might die trying? Okay. I did. Okay. I do have a dagger. And I put my goggles on. Safety first. Pull up the hood and I buckle myself up. I take my scarf from around my waist and tie it around me for a facemask. Medicine, it's higher. Just a straight check? Natural 20! ASHLY and I'm back! Got the sac, now what? Do you have any more flasks or anything to put it in? If we poke-- if you have a little tube or something that is straw, a little bamboo straw, put it in there, and go down? I think it would be useful to you for sure. Can I help with my natural 20? I think they're better to be used on your bolts and things like that. Can't he--? All right, I'll take one. It's fine with me. You guys fine with that? Okay. Can I climb a tree and do I see anything on the horizon in where we're going, like another tree clearing that looks like it might be up ahead? Athletics? 24. Rolled an 18. Whatever you cast on me, Caleb, is like... I feel so good! MATT and But the lingering effects, you know, I'm in the afterglow! So relaxed. Okay. 17. I climb back down. I say we gather some branches, some scrap wood for firewood, in case this might be the only forest we come across in a while. See as far as we can get, maybe we can hide under a rock for shelter or something. I shoved one in the haversack too. I gathered some stuff. It's such a quiet bird. I'm used to very loud birds. Oh yeah, he's an owl now. He's so cute. Mr. Owl was a dick. It was a dick move. Do you have any awake? You're looking at him. I'm going to groggily stumble over, put on my googles as I start stumbling towards the light. Yeah, I'm going to walk and I'm like It's bright enough, and I got to pee anyway. I'll be right back. Okay, no, I'll stealth a little bit. Okay. That was almost good. 11. But he was on first watch. Amazing. It's lubricated with all the blood of her enemies. I reach back out to her and I go Yes, right?! We are so going to die. I'm with you. Saving throw? 15? Yeah, I'm not bad. I'm not one of the bad guys... That you were definitely talking about. That I'm aware of, right? What bad guys are you talking about? Okay. That's in the middle of nowhere. Okay, 18. Firbolg? Amazing! I say, Bad guys kidnapping kids, right? That's scary stuff. Trying to protect your son? Who-- Currently five-- But just call us the Nein. The Mighty Nein. Here, M. Nein? (whistles) The Guitaya Clan? Guai-- Guiatao Clan. You say he's not your son, but part of your clan? Is the whole clan wiped out? Who's left? Other half of our party members were taken from us in the middle of the night, just last night. Seems very similar ways, considering neither of the rest of us heard anything. Yeah. Nila? She's the one going after them? What was her son's name? Whispers? You couldn't bring a horse back from the dead, could you? Just didn't know how far your abilities stretch. Water Closet's gone forever-- He saved our lives a lot. (laughing) Downtrodden. That's Caleb. He always stands about 20 feet back. Can you do anything about this acid burn? And I sit down next to her. Oh! They are called ankhegs, you guys! We'll try. Thank you. Man, normally Fjord is here to do this part. Thank you. that does feel good. I did something today. All right. We leave. We've already lost two of our horses, why not lose a few more? What? You know, if we stumble upon one of them maybe be like, "Hey. Met your grandma." I know that's a big deal, that whole mission completing thing. Yeah. Fast pace. Seven? I'm down as well, but-- And in that hour we can look for a place to rest? It's like pushing for the next rest stop. Can we look for a good camping spot? Oh shit! 18. Disadvantage on your checks. Along the way, do we see anything that looks like a good alcove or somewhere that would be nice? Which we have advantage on, right? A six and-- oh, no advantage? I'll take that six with my add perception of three, so nine. Nein. He's hangry. Yeah, I'm up too. Molly, you want to take next watch? All right. 13. I'm not much of a gambler, you're thinking of Jester. What? What? Wait are these like playing cards or tarot cards? You know I fucking hate those things. I don't want anything to do with them. The best lie I've ever told? Hmm... All right, deal. Let me flip to my backstory. (laughing) Natural twenty. This one has a pretty big number on it. That's fascinating, what kind of scam? Wow. That's pretty fascinating. Do you not like knowing your past, that way you can have multiple backstories? Be multiple people at once? I'll tell you one of my best lies, the one I was most proud of. Just because it was a pretty good one. Yeah. There was a politician in the town where I grew up that I didn't like very much. Didn't like his wife, either. Wanted to find some dirt on them. Pretended to be a house hand for them, a little handyman. Found some dirt, found out they were cheating on each other and destroyed their relationships and their lives. Maybe I shouldn't be proud of that actually. Yeah... anyway. Cheers. Just maybe don't have a job that relies on relationships, either. Public opinion-- Yeah. I do my morning push-up and pull-up routine. And then I'm ready to go. Dope as fuck, yes I do. Holy shit you guys I just figured out how we can save 30 minutes. (Schwarzenegger voice) I feel like I'm always coming. All right. Did we catch up to them? We shouldn't clue them off that we're here. Okay. Maybe a couple of us could flank around? What's the terrain? What time is it? We're nowhere near Shadycreek? Lorenzo is a fighter type? What was the name of the rogue again? Protto. This is our fucking guy! Wait, in the cages? So we wait until they camp? What were you going to say, Keg? Like mentally break them? Fuck. And set up an ambush? That's a damn good idea. I wonder if we could do a little bit of both. Free the people in the cage and then ambush later? Nah, that seems distracting. At a medium pace. I'm the worst. Helming a stealth check? Well, I already have it, I just haven't used it yet. Do I still have it? I don't have it. Oh, but I can look at it again! I thought I might have needed it on the thing, but I rolled a natural 20 on my sack check. Do I have to call that I'm going to use advantage on it before or I can roll and then choose? Don't fuck me, Gil. Yeah, it's 20 total. (whispers) Should I do it again? Oh, that was almost a natural 20, but instead it's five. Are we going to rest on the other side? It lasts a day. Are we going to sleep on the other side? Yeah? I'm going to save it. Five. It's got to be just long enough to where they're zoning out. Not me, I'm tired. We need to plan. That's actually not a bad plan, just in case. Would they kill you on sight if they saw you? We used it on the troll and it did nothing. Horses aren't a big threat, I would rather focus on the people. Yeah, but if we don't kill the people then they can kill us. These seem like people who are confident in themselves-- Ooh. How rocky are those hills in between? Could we trigger a rock slide? Maybe using Keg as a distraction up front-- Couple Fireballs. Have just certain targets between some of us? I could stun somebody depending on how close I get. Maybe Lorenzo, try and square off against him. Of course all the spell-slingers are good to take out early as well. Maybe we focus on the druid and the sorcerer? I feel like if you could hold the barbarian, keep the barbarian away... I could maybe stun Lorenzo and focus down on the rogue and the druid. I have ball bearings. I have rope. Can we set some sort of tripwire trap? Is that something you can do? You're good at finding traps. Are you good at setting traps? With that big swinging log thing! We send Keg to distract. You go in-- --right, but if they try to go around it or something. It's just a tree. That's the name of this next chapter of our journey, you guys. No, you go in and try and get the people out of the cage. But wait, you can't see the cages? They're magically cloaked? Until you get there. Maybe you have to be close enough. You go in, try and get them out. You come out, send a signal through Caleb that you're out, and then Caleb does a big Slow thing, slows them down. We go in, punk their asses. We win. We're victorious. No, with Slow. Slow. No, we slow the people. Hang on, let me go through this again. We fell the tree. We send in Keg. Keg distracts. We send in Nott. Nott tries to pick the locks to the cages. Get the people out. Nott runs. Nott sends the message to Caleb. Caleb does the Slow spell on the party. We go in, we kick ass, we win, we're victorious. I just said that 30 seconds ago. Did you guys get it this time? No, it is suspicious, but it's distracting. That's dumb. Maybe she's standing on the tree and she's like, "I'm a badass with an axe and "a hammer and I took down this tree and now I'm going to take down you." Then we win, we're victorious. Same plan. SAM and Okay, okay. Plan A-- Plan A, you do that. We try to slow them. If that fails, you're our distraction. Let's do it. Oh, snap. He's a witch, Sam. You know this. He sees the future. It wasn't that undercover. It was Max going, "No cast is allowed in here for ten "minutes!" It wasn't that stealthy. You weren't here for that. We should get a mapmaking sock for him. We are. We wanted to film it this week, but we got super distracted with building the studio. Taliesin wants to get rid of it. I want to so bad. Nott and I look for the best elements of cover. That's good. That's good. Oh, she's fine. You beat me to it. I'm aroused. You have an awesome axe, right? I enjoy gilding lilies. You would think, there was a tornado that came through here. I think the best trap we have is Keg standing behind the tree. Where are you going to hide? Yeah. I'll be in bush two. Molly, are you taking bush one? I'm bush two. Yeah. These are great codenames. Do we have a signal as to when we go? You're going to do the Slow spell, and then we fuck shit up. Dry running it. No, this way. Do you want to tradesies with Molly? Yeah, well, it's called Slow, not Stop. If it was a Stop spell, it would be called a Stop spell. How far is your distance? Okay, so, further. I think we want to try and get the Slow spell off after it's past the log, right? No! Because I'm here, I'm here, Caleb's here, you're there. Because this will make them funnel, which will gather them for Caleb's spell. What? Why don't you tradesies with me, then? How wide is your spell? Okay. It's a 40-foot radius? A cube? I mean, it's a 40-foot cube. Why would they be in a line? You're just assuming they're going to be in a line instead of clumped together. On the first one, you Slow the second one. We attack, we win. Still winning is part of this plan. I just want to make sure that that's clear. Yes. Look for our friends. Oh yeah, who has that shit? Yeah, you do, don't you? Because you haven't transcribed it? You're out of paper? But you're out of paper? And how many feet ahead did you set that? So are we doing Invisibility or no? Yeah, I need to rest, I'm exhausted. The sorcerer is the half-elf. Yeah, I can move 40 feet, my speed. I'm pretty quick. I've got some pretty dope mobility. I think Lorenzo is going to be a problem, because he has reach, and he's a leader. If we find that half-orc, druids tend to have healing abilities. I'm just saying, if they reveal themselves at the same time. I feel like we shouldn't, either. We share body warmth by all spooning in a chain. Do I still have the dodecahedron? I toss it to Nott. Me too. I'm so scared. That's the sorcerer. These are the two magic users. The barbarian is a human? 20. Add my boots. 20. A lot of bad guys there. Ruzza, the sorcerer! Did the druid save? The druid saved, Dwelma. That's pretty dope, though. No, Nott is. Nott rolled a 21 and I rolled a 20. Okay. I'm probably more than 40 feet away from the druid? Sweet jump. It is what I live for! Ten! Oh, fuck. Okay. Two attacks. First attack, okay! That's a natural 16, plus seven is 21. Right? 16 plus seven? 21, and that's eight damage. I'm going to spend a ki point to do Stunning Strike. That really sucks. I do have ball bearings. Take my second hit. That's 20 total. Yeah. Another eight damage. I'm going to spend another ki point to try Stunning Strike again. What was that, plus three? 14. I'm burning through so many ki points. I'm going to spend one more ki point to do Patient Defense because I'm probably going to need it now. Three ki points! Burning them out. I know, so quiet! I'm still stoked on our-- was it Umbrasyl? The frost dragon? Yes, I am. When Vorugal fought Yenk. No, I ran over there. I'm fighting the druid! Who's going to attack you? The sorcerer. Disadvantage. Miss, yeah. Does that mean I get to take an attack on her? Mage Slayer? I almost took that. Took Sentinel instead. Yeah. She was one of the ones that saved. That's why I was trying to stun her. SAM; What do you cast Dispel Magic on? Fuck! That's why I was trying to stun her! I think she still could have done it, though. That's not very good at all. 12. What? She doesn't move anywhere! She's not moving. She can't move and she takes five damage. Natural 20. Yeah, don't get frozen. Oh no! Fuck! That's a good call. Oh God! Damn, this fucking druid. I'm just going to lay into the druid. Okay, first attack. Natural 20! Thank you, Gil! That's doubling dice damage. Big money, come on! Six plus four ten. Really? Second attack. 14 plus seven, so 21. I did 11 damage on my second attack on her. Fuck yes! I have my bonus. Can I move and then attack again? I thought about that, but I have enough movement that I can make it to the barbarian, right? Are you going to handle Lorenzo? Who's going to handle Lorenzo? (shouting) Who's going to handle Lorenzo? Fuck! I'm going to jump over the horses' asses and get to Lorenzo. 14. I have 40 feet of movement, so wherever I can go. Can I land on the horse's back? I'm on a horse. Am I within range of him? I'm in combat range of him. I'm going to spend another ki point to do Patient Defense. I don't trust this motherfucker. Hopefully that's useful. Yeah. 21. You get knocked unconscious? Not that! Am I flanking Molly? I can, as Sentinel. 14? Fuck! No! 16 misses, 17 hits. I can still use Deflect Missiles, right, to lower it? You should know I have no respect for authority. He's covered in shit. There's the barbarian on Caleb, which is not good. That's a lot of time. I say Hey Keg-- no wait, that's your name-- Hey Lorenzo, this one's for Beau-- no, fuck! I'm getting all my names fucked up because I'm so stressed out! This one's for Molly and Yasha, because we failed on this before. I'm going to get it right this time. I'm going to take my tinderbox and light it, and I'm going to-- right onto him, light him on fire. I mean, I'm touching him with it. Okay. d6 plus what? Four. I take my staff and pure brute anger, right across his face. 12. 18. Six damage. I take my movement and go towards Caleb and Nott. Fuck. Yeah. Didn't you have a thing held for the sorceress? They're going to try and capture Molly? She's dead? Another four damage. Fuck you, Lorenzo. Yeah, don't ream us for all the things we probably did wrong. There's nothing we can do to bring him back, is there? There's nothing we got.
