Ashley! When did you get here! I lived in mine over the holiday. Very soft. They're so comfy. And we found out your parents watch! We had no idea your parents watched. I think this is also technically yours, too. Yeah, we put expansion pack spell cards in there that we can all use. And new art. Oh, I haven't seen that one yet. I've got body paint. Ashy body paint. Well, we have all that awesome proof, right? I feel like they'll see that as a conflict of interest. Yennen? Yevon? Yennen? Make sure that they notarize it and all that good stuff. Depends on what we want? Well, he said it would take a year, and you'd need to have Allura work on that. To be fair, she was just using it as a rug. Right? They were eaten by harpies. There's no teleportation circles, is there? I can. Yeah. Actually. Long as we all jump within six seconds. Home. To our keep. But it's coming. It's on the way. I have a 6th-level spell called Teleportation via Plants, where as long as I've seen the tree before, we can walk through the tree. LAURA and That's true, wasn't Allura on her way? The emperor dude? Theoretically, they were trying to keep Allura from us, anyway, so it's not like she can help us in Emon. Right? So we can go home. TALIESIN, MARISHA, and Let's hop in a tree. What? Well, we technically already have a letter coming, and we'll have a letter in hand. Right? Yeah, I hope our keep's still there. To see our keep to make sure it's not on fire? That's not a bad idea. Let's do it. You guys want some pancakes and bacon? The bear will probably be able to come with us. Sorry. He can fit through the Sun Tree, right? Let's use the Sun Tree. I say, hey boo. I'll see you soon. You be good, you take care of you, man. This is the best tree of all time. Are these cartoon physics? Jump! Why are you sleeping outside? You have a bed upstairs! How long have you been here? So many questions! We literally kicked it for a weekend and went to a festival. We could've come back. Yeah, thanks to you. (excited stammering) Did you feel our bag of dicks that we did? Were you aware of our bag of holy light dicks? That was an out-of-context thing. Me and you teamed up, and we killed Lady Briarwood by-- Well, I didn't know how aware you were, because your connection was fuzzy. That was awesome! I read it in a book. LAURA and Aw, someone's going through our shit. I will. Bye, Tibsy. I give him a hug. Yes, how did that work? Just curious, because he was kind of a test run. Oh good, good. That's what I was going for. Sure! Awesome. Right, remember, we were going to let him stay him the guest room, but he was like, I'm going to stay-- Well, I mean, I'll find it. It's in my old notebook. What's today? What day is it? Yeah, there's days of the week. She didn't go downstairs. That's mean, that's mean. How much coin did we pull out of the treasury of Whitestone? You got a 20? Maybe we can just hand over the bloody bag of gold to Desmond. We have our, who has our papers? Bust out the mustache? You think he would go that far? Tofor, what was her last name? So this is essentially our jury? Judge? Judgment party? Yeah, sorry. Fort Daxio? Don't forget the mustard. Don't spend it all in one place, bruh. Watch the flask. Yeah, you know, I'm wondering if I was a sneaky bastard-- Thank you so much. I sometimes get concerned. If I was a sneaky bastard, and I wanted to make sure-- Thank you. And if I were to make sure (laughs) I had an emergency escape route outside of the city, and was maybe tasked to build, I don't know, say, our keep, within the last year, I feel like we need to start at home here. Because our keep is butted up against the border of the city and everywhere else. Yeah, can we get them? No, I think he escaped through our keep. Yeah, can we ask for transparency and information exchange or something like that with these people? So that we can come in and out of the Cloudtop District? Are we cool there? Okay, cool. So here's my other question. The Briarwoods wanted something with Emon. That had nothing to do with building a bridge, right? What did they want? Was like a ruse? So the Briarwoods coming to Emon is assumed to be just a formality? That's all they were here for? But why send-- why would I go? Why would you go? Why not send a representative? You know what I mean? Well you know what they say when you Asum. (weak laughter) I can't do the arcane thing. Do we have any idea when the letters came in to Emon that we were successful? Either or. When did they get them, do we know? Can we find that information? Yes, that one. And it's been about three days since they've seen Riskel? Can I go outside? I wanna do a-- no, outside. Dirt. I want dirt under me. I'll be right back! I'll be right back, I'm not gonna, I'll be right back. I just like the bushes better. Well, I'm out in the courtyard. I want to do a Commune with Nature spell. Is Riskel anywhere in town? Can I take my second question to focus a little harder and figure out where in town he is? Thanks! Vision fades? That's all I got? So I get one more question? (laughs) What is the meaning of life? Can I see any type of underground secret tunnels or passageways that lead out of the city? What? Okay. Cool beans. Ah! What! That's funny, I found the same thing, but I just meditated for a minute. You know, I'm glad we got things that overlapped, though. That's good, I mean, it corroborates, exactly. Cool. Well, I found good news, Eskil, I mean, Riskel is still in town. I'm pretty sure. I got-- his essence was floating in nature's ether, and nature told me he was here. In the Graveyard District, it seems like he's somewhere-- I saw that-- he's somewhere underground. Also, it looks like there is in fact quite a lot of tunnels and secret passageways that lead out of the city near there. So we have been, I thought it sounded familiar. Wait, was this the same tavern, is this the one that's got, like-- Right, is this the one that's also like a whorehouse? Is that that one? What time is it right now? Yeah, I think they are. I think they're eating popcorn. I can hear it. I was gonna say, what does the clientele of the bar look like? (laughing) Dr. Dre! (laughter) Yeah, you know, we never get to see you play, Scanlan, not to your full capacity! I go and I get as many ales as I can carry and start handing them to those guys. Here, have a drink. Yeah! Oh shit! It's true. What's his name? Insight check? 29. I rolled a 19. I get secrets! So you're just, out of the good of your heart, wanting to redistribute a little bit of funds to help out a few less fortunate people, that's all you have in this? Really? And where exactly did you find this information? On this dickhead? You asked him? What? Well, if I know anything about your skills, Scanlan, I think it says a lot about Dr. Dranzel. So-- You're welcome. Forgive me if I'm-- Yeah, I was going to say, he was going to go downstairs. I'll go with Team Downstairs. So do we think that the Clasp is protecting Riskel? Is that what we're assuming? I mean, you were with these people. Once. What-- 15. Yeah, hork like you mean it! So there are still two cooks in the kitchen? It was just one big, full album. The song was a whole album. I can't believe the Jethro Tull song with no flutes was the one you happened to find! Plank. Hold your abs. I'm up next. Oh, it is a rainbow. Sylvan? I do. Do you want an enhancement of your abilities? Okay. You use dexterity, right? I give him Cat's Grace? I cast Enhance Ability on him. Kind of, yeah. Yeah. In their language it's pronounced huh-gluf. You already popped the top lock and nothing happened, right? You've got advantage, so why not, fuck it. So wait, are there two different directions? Can I ascertain if there's any type of draft or any--? Oh, you already tried? I definitely would rather not fight the entire thieves' guild. Sounds to me like you just won twice. Can I Druidcraft a little bit and Druidcraft a little bit of breeze seeping from the box? Sleight of hand? Oh! Did you see that? That was awesome. 21. I say, careful. Do not open that box without the password or else it will melt your eyeballs from inside your head. (laughter) 11. You never know, it acts in mysterious ways. Oh, shit! Can I Druidcraft a gust coming out of it? Okay! Is it the one we got at last Winter's Crest? That one? The one that we were using shards of it to carve through dimensions? Cool. I'm going to go ahead and block in the entryway for good measure. Yeah. Why not? I mean, we can get it out. So is this leading into something crazy? Into a labyrinth? Or just his cell? As far as we know, just a cell. Did half-orc dude say he was just in this cell? That's all he said? Is there any other entrances or anything else around? Fine, go for it. 14. Okay, I'm going to peek around Grog, and try and cast Hold Person on him. 18. Just my spell DC, right? Aw. No. Ah! Yes! I just said yes. No, wait, I don't have it, I don't have it. Nope. Never mind. No! Go. He has to make a wisdom saving throw. Oh, is that what he was doing against my spell save? Is that what it is? Do it. He wanted to take him to the ground. That's what I was going to say. Can we tie him? Tie him up? He's down on the ground? I was going to say, I can. Okay. Yeah, I'll go ahead and vine him. To-- Oh, right, because it's got to be against a wall. Can it be the ground? Yeah, can I essentially just entangle him into the ground? Yeah, he's down. Yeah, that's right. Can I do Entangle instead and just do a concentrated Entangle? I mean, I can try and Hold Person him again. Do we want to do that? I can Hold Person him again. Can I do a Druidcraft, Matt? A Druidcraft where I druidcraft a vine around his ankles? Oh, okay, cool. A grapevine? Grapevines are pretty hard. I know, it'd be a close grip. As a fight-- as a staff user that's-- You know what? Bring it, bitch. 'Sup? Miss. 17 is exactly what he needed. 15. Yeah. Uh-huh. Is this all for that staff comment? Uh-huh. (laughs) I just go to my earpiece and I go Thank you, Percy. Fucking dick, he deserves it. Yeah, Keyleth gets up and bleeding from my mouth. And I just take him and I grab him by his face. and I just say Fucking traitor. And I spit a big glob of blood in his face. It's true. (laughs) Oh, that's very good. The cooks are back in the kitchen? Yeah, I mean, what are they gonna do now? Oh, hang on. Are we about to walk through a very crowded bar? Playing the long game, I like it. Oh shit, forgot. Yeah! Scanlan backstory. Oh, popcorn down. So next week we're doing Critmas, next week.
