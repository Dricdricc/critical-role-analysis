We'll have a lot of road time to watch it on the way back. Oh man! So many good things! There is a sticker update. We found them. The mail has found them from where USPS quite literally lost them. I think the distributor found them and now they're bringing some back to the distributor so they can be sent back to us, and then we will be dropping those in the mail. It feels like a time capsule, but in a book. It's so cute. We love it. Yeah. Because you need a character sheet. It's important when you've crawled into a mountain's butt. Right in that sciatic nerve. Can we do that? Can we find pressure points and take him down with acupressure? Thanks for tanking the week for us. Oh, I have something I can stall time with. For those who didn't catch the debut episode of One Night Only, it was awesome. We talked about Sagas of Sundry Dread. We dressed up. We made it an event. One Night Only is our special event series that we are attempting to do monthly, is the goal. Where we bring you people from your favorite fandom in entertainment and pop culture and get to ask questions with them, panel-style. Inside the Actors Studio style. Well, it was Darin De Paul this past week. We're going to switch it up, depending on what the subject matter is. I really want to do a JPL One Night Only, where we bring all the smart scientist dudes from NASA. And then for those who missed it, we announced at the end of One Night Only that there will be a season two of Sagas of Sundry, entitled Madness. Yeah, everyone was there. It's concentration up to ten minutes, so let's move quickly. I'll be behind Vax, since we touched down first, I guess. Actually, that's a good point. Does this look like it was carved by man from cannibal dwarves, or nature-made? Investigation, or nature check? My better one? That doesn't count. No, nope. Four total. Did we get a time frame of how long ago this crypt was built before? How old this crypt has been around? Does it look familiar to any of us? I feel like we already knew so much of that. Okay, let's get up this river before I lose concentration. Well, this thing is massive. Maybe a lake? An underground lake? Hang on. Can I do a nature check? Is there anything weird about this? 17? The more it's going to fall apart? Start to crumble? We have to get to the top. This thing is too big. I don't think my Earthquake will do enough. Did you learn it today, Pike? So our right, its left. So go left? To the left. I say, get to the middle, stay away from the walls! And I cast Transmute Rock, right in the space where he went, and I reach my hands in and try and grab him out of mud. Yeah, it's a 3rd-level spell. I've done it once before, and it didn't work very well. We're fighting walls! First doors, now walls! Oh, they're undead necromantic elemental earth ellies? Eight. I'm about to tell you. Be careful. They can go into the walls and earth glide, so watch your feet. They're vulnerable to thunder damage, anything vibrate-y, because rocks. We've been stuck in his digestive tract! That was so close to being a natural 20! 12. Did they turn us to stone? What did they do? Okay. I'm going to concentrate for a second, and then go earth elemental. (thud) And now that I'm earth elemental, I have tremor sense. Can I sense where these other motherfuckers are? But I want to be underground. I'm there, but I'm still underground right now. Yeah. (singing) Put on your earthglide shoes and dance! (speaking) Okay, I want to go right in the center of as many of them as I can hit and take a cue from Scanlan and do a Thunderwave underground. Because I can cast in Wild Shape now. Not using material components, you mean? No, that's me. That's me, baby, that's me. I'm going to do it 3rd-level, too. It's a 15-foot radius from you. Oh, like a (explosion noise). Oh, cool! Got it. Then I'll take those two dudes. (thudding noises) Underground! That's not a great roll, but it'll do. Ones and twos. So that is 16 times two, so 32 damage to both of them. No. And they also get pushed ten feet. Yeah. Sure. This whole thing was coming apart! Get Trinket away from that wall. You're still blind? Okay. What? That's awesome! Do I get an attack of opportunity? It doesn't say! How do you know? No. No, no, it doesn't. No. I just don't, okay. No! Range ten feet! It does say range ten feet. I didn't know! 21. 15. Kill it! Okay. Do I see Trinket underground? Jesus, that scared the shit out of me. Do I go for the bear, or do I go for the gnome? All right, can I get to Pike in 50 feet? 50. Okay. Can I very gently grab the gnome, and then siege monster bust us out? I'm a siege monster! It's like air, he said. I will take that 17, that is much better. For a 22. (excited earth elemental grunting) I can't do anything else, probably. But Pike can! So holding little Pike like a voodoo doll, like a flashlight. But I'm holding Pike! Can she see? Oh. To get there. (agreeing elemental grunts) (heavy thud) Do you need some more? Yeah. Like a lich. A phylactery. I go rescue the bear. Are there any more? Keyleth blocks as much as she can and goes (earth elemental speaking). We made her that armor that we never went back and picked up because we fucked up. I touch the ground, still in my earth elemental form, do I sense anything? Tremor sense? Any vibrations? Yep, mm-hmm. Oh. Okay. So there are the double doors and then it's a cave-in on one side? I can just earth glide under and peek up. Is it a spell? Probably is, he's just undead now. It could be bad. Or he's unearthed and-- yeah he could be blocking a-- Yeah. I'm going to be with him by this door. It could just be a fight? Deplete us down. Correct. Ah, come on. We're running out of time. Oh, five minutes go by, and--? I mean, might as well. Unless it's already been raided? Stalwart warrior of our mountain secrets. Yes. Yeah, it's plus 18 to your maximum hit points. Oh, I'm sorry, it's just temporary hit points. But you don't get them back. Right, right, okay. Then, yeah. Yeah. I mean-- That was hot. Yeah, I'm outside, waiting for a call. I know. Keyleth is in the back facepalming right about now. Can Keyleth do any type of wind gust to try and push this away to help? But ahead of time? I'll go ahead and clear the chamber so they don't have to do this again. Wind gust. Gust of Wind, 2nd-level spell, sorry. 13 is not good. Oh, fucking hell. And I cast Greater Restoration on Percy. Can we please stop robbing tombs and get back to our actual mission? Can we go? Am I in there from the gust? Take his belt. Does it look like the same black metal as in the tomb? The hammer? We have to take another short rest. While we're walking? I mean, we have pulled cursed items out of tombs before. Sure. We really need to keep moving. I hope it's great. What kind of an alien language? Any that we recognize? What if he's nice? What if he's that random creepy merchant you find in the middle of nowhere? (rugged voice) Would you like to see my wares-- Yeah, Clarota was nice! Is it vibey? Cincture. Cincture of the Stone King. Cincture. It's like Spanx. We should call it Spanx of the Stone King. It's like a cincture. Like Spanx. Your shirt's so dope, too. That's relevant. Accurate. Can I do a peek and check to see if there's signs of any cave-in potentials? Potential cave-ins? 28. We don't hear anybody or anything? I drag in the human, escort him in, and go ahead and light up my hands. Your last one? You steal my bird, you die. You steal my bird, she will pluck your eyes out. It's turned into a battle cry. Pickle wreck! Three. (groaning) I rolled a one, that's how. I rolled a one. It was so close. You almost critted. Wow. That was rough, buddy. I'm sorry. What is happening to us? Starts talking to him again. It's Craven Edge. He just got a make-over. Why do you always get the fucked-up weapon? This is going to knock him out. Yeah, that hits. Oh, thanks, man. Only because I turn around at Scanlan and go (laughs) That's good. Aw, yeah. And I go Ugh! Yeah. Not the mantle! Yeah, that hits. Hold my antlers! Yeah, that's good. 19. Okay? Is it we're going to have to do radiant damage? That was a long time ago. Hey, Grog. You're good on health, yeah? Save it. I didn't know you were so flexible, Grog. I might drop a Fireball on your ass. Matt! Did you skip me? No, I know. Yeah, no, I remember that. This is the second time he's going, right? It's okay. I don't think I've done anything yet. I've only dodged. That's okay. You can place it to where it might hit both of them and not us. He ran out of sight? You guys go plunder the loot. I'll creep over. That's okay! You're so cute. I want to see if I can see him. Can I not see him? I go, hey it's okay, calm-- Fireball! Out of the staff. (counting) Can I get two more d6s from you? It's out of my staff. I can't do any more, right? Reroll, yep. (singing) Like a d6, like a like a d6! (counting) 35 damage. Okay, I'm going to take my bonus action to do something I've never done before. I'm going to trace, from my staff, and pull out a flame blade. (shing) I take my flaming sword and do a few Jedi kid moves. When no one's looking, go (lightsaber noises). Wait, I can Commune with Nature and maybe figure out the tunnel system, or depending on where we are and if we think we're on that time crunch and we want to get going-- I didn't want to burn this yet. I did bring Find the Path, which is a one-day concentration spell which gets us to where we want to go as quick as possible. But I don't know. Can I do that with Thar Amphala? Well, if we're getting to Thar Amphala. Which is why I haven't wanted to do it yet, until we felt like we needed to go. I'm just saying, we have that at our disposal when we feel. Do we want to do a quick Commune with Nature, then, to try and get paths? It's going to take a few minutes, though. I could get an idea of the tunnel system for a three-mile radius. Okay, 25. But you're not letting me cast it, right? If you see me topless, please don't take a photo. It was a joke! It was a fucking joke that the internet will take too seriously, I'm sure. If you see Liam topless, take all the photos.
