To be fair, that sounds like a southern California school. Silverlake! The DX boxes aren't the clothes boxes, are they? It's going to take me the whole unboxing to get it open. This is my further transformation to actually becoming Melisandre in School of Thrones. Yeah, if anyone doesn't know, Matt produced, and I helped him in it, we were in this web series called School of Thrones, like four years ago. You make a cameo in it. It's basically Game of Thrones in a John Hughes film. Just watch it. I hear they're besties. He's actually my new bestie. Yeah, he gave me a ring, yeah. My new best friend. Lin-Manuel, on this show. This one. Speaking of charities, before we go on. Speaking of charities, I would still like to give a shout-out to 826LA, who we so love and support. They're great. People will send us tweets being like, "Hey, do you guys still support 826LA?" Always, I don't think you can stop supporting 826LA. TALIESIN and And I've seen people take you up on your suggestion that it's always a great date place. We've had people tweet at us and be like, we took you up on that, and it is a good date place, because they have cute store fronts, so you should go. And we can't help that. So much safer here, kids. So we're on the outside of the wall? Let's move in. Why don't we have them run? Have them run. Yeah. I grab them and I say, run that way. Don't die. They're good. What? All right, yeah, sure. I hand them a gatestone. Hide in the bushes, don't go far. Oh, fuck. I say, try and stay unseen! We all charge for the gate. I Message to Vex, and I say, what do you see? How many wyverns are there? Do you see any dragons? We have an Avengers moment. We're running. Like Guardians of the Galaxy! Okay, you know what, any movie where they run in slow motion toward something, which happens a lot. Do you ever get that? Why can't you be Trinket? We love the bear more than you, Percy. You go first. Okay. I run to Percy and I grab and pick him up and keep running, and I say, let me know if you're poisoned. Okay, I help him up and I say, come on! And we keep running. That's not too bad. Grog, Grog! 100 needs three hands to make. It needs-- Okay. Keep running! Keep running! Do we see anyone we know? Do we see Allura? Come on, opal dice. That's not bad! 26. But there doesn't seem to be any tabards from Emon, or any tabards from Syngorn or anything like that? I mean, that still sucks. But okay. About how many wyverns? I'm going to also go for the wyverns. They're coming at us? Is it a group of-- how many? Before anything crazy happens, I'm going to go ahead and pull up the Spire of Conflux and I'm going to Fireball right where they are. 19. Wait, Fireball. I don't know this damage. Give me two. I get to reroll ones, too, because it's fire damage. And I got three ones. So those will all get rerolled. That is true. Ten, 15, 25 points. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! 25, 30 points of damage. Thanks, Sam! MATT; As you guys are getting your weapons ready, you have both your daggers out at the side. You have your axe at the batter-up position. You watch as suddenly they burst into red flame and a number of their charred, burning bodies tumble to the ground, motionless. As the fire subsides, all six have been destroyed by the blast from the Fireball. No, no, no! He's on a wyvern, so I'm going to say maybe. Come on, Pike! Come on! That was funny. 15. He hated us? He hated us. What's his name? Hey, wonder why we hated him, we can't remember his name, Seeker Xanthas. Well, if he's from Emon, and Emon is currently under Thordak's reign-- It's, like, exactly what I need to get there. How far away is he? It's that much. Okay. Is there anyone else coming at us? Okay. Where did you say where the wyvern riders were, again? Roughly, in the air? Are they clustering together? Oh, yeah? They're each 40 feet? Fuck. Okay, you know what? And how far away am I from them? Jesus. I was going to try and get these guys out, but okay. How many are busting through the door? How many lizardmen? To bust through. Those are bad guys? Well, let's Fireball them again. That was fun! So let's blow that shit up. I can see both of them. Oh, I have another eight. All of them? All six of them? I'm drunk with power. It's 6d8? 8d6! (counts) Yeah, I get to reroll ones. That's also cocked. That one bumped it from what it was-- It was a four, okay. So six, ten, 18, 20, five, 30 again. No, 31! I feel like this thing should come with a child warning. Oh, jeez. We were all running towards the door, right? We're all trying to get in? We're all trying to get in? I start heading that way. Why'd you say it so nonchalant? It's always like it's a bad idea. Well, he held his turn. His ability to weaponize things-- And I could use some love. I'm running with Percy. If she wants to give us a group hug? Oh. Sorry. Aw, thanks, Pike! This wyvern asshole did that? Yeah, this is-- Happy 2016! Why is G.I. Joe so much shorter than Barbie? Damn it! Now people are going to scream "Hunter's Mark!" at you on the internet! Welcome to triple digits! Congratulations, you joined the rest of us! Okay, I am going to Tidal Wave these motherfuckers. Yeah! Still have that packed from the Fire Plane, what's up! So I don't have a-- do we have a laser pointer in the house? You know, it's funny. We bought, like, ten laser pointers, forever ago. I had a laser pointer. Hey, I think this is mine! Yeah, 30 feet long, ten foot wide, ten foot tall. Everything must make a dexterity save. That's exactly what I'm doing. Yep! And they are knocked prone, and if they are flamey, then all unprotected flames are distinguished. They're dapper! So they don't take extra water damage? So 4d8? So 21 damage, and they're knocked prone. 21 damage. I'll stay where I am, actually. You looked like you needed a bath! Oh! Can I watch it, be like-- You've got a good arm! Heh, uh, yeah. That hits. She throws rocks! Press 'x' to use! Hot. Here's some more. It feels better that way. Ooh! Those are good rolls! I am hurt. Heal me. With your words. All right. I'll take it. Yeah, 71 hit points. You're next to me. Because I want to do a Fire-transport-via-plants-ball. I got friends. He's available, yo! Yeah. That sounds awesome. Okay. So we have a giant bird, and another giant bird, and they're all really angry at us, right? And then tiny, tiny dragons with wings. Okay. Where's the wyvern? (singing) Kill the wyvern, kill the wyvern! That happened. Yeah, we kind of are, aren't we? Man, I'm going to go ahead and cast Call Lightning, I guess? And I'm going to bring it down on the wyvern that's fucking shit up next to Percy. Yup, that's the daddy. 3d10. That's not a great roll. Ten points of lightning damage. To the wyvern. Well, technically, doesn't Call Lightning every creature within five feet of that point must make a dexterity saving throw? So he also takes the ten points of damage. And then I'm going to use my bonus action to go-- let's go air elemental. (sniffs) Pit check is good! (laughter) Can I levitate a little? Get in the air a little bit? Yeah. Thanks, bruh. You're my charge. Yeah, boy. The adrenaline kicks in! Oh! Question. Are we inside the fort walls? We're inside the outer walls. So the ones that were trying to go through that door were trying to get through the inner walls? Okay. So we've gotten through one layer of wall? And we're trying to get through the other layer? Everyone seems to be. Just clarifying. Continue. It's made of polyester. It's real bad. Oh, god. Gets a nosebleed. What'd you get? Fucking dick. Can we take him out? He was always an asshole. Come on. He was always annoyed by us. But Vex, he never had any redeeming qualities. This is the first time we're hearing of this! (chuckle) They spent a lot of time together. Ouch, jeez, I rolled a two. Seven. 5th-level Fireball? Who did this? Wait, is that Xanthas? What a doucher. Oh, Buddy. All hands on deck! Let's take this bird down. Bring it. Hoping to get hit. Hit me, come on, hit me! Yeah. Negatory. Oh yeah. Huh? No, I'm immune to poison. Elemental. I'm good. I'm good. Yeah. Oh no! Not Boromir! Boromir was my favorite. Yes. Get it. Get it! Big money, no whammies! This is great. We don't know the damage on the inside yet, but this is fine. Kill it! Okay so, I have the wyvern in my face? And the wyvern rider? I'm going to do two slam attacks. What looks worse? The wyvern, then. I'm going to take out the wyvern. Okay. Okay, what am I adding? Hang on. Sorry, I'm the worst. Oh, plus five, okay so the first one is 18. And the second one is not as good. That's a 14. Really? Aw, so they each take... Okay cool, so the first one is good. 13 plus five so 18 for the first hit. And four plus three is seven plus five is 12. 12 for the second. And then I'm going to use a bonus action. I have never done this before. I'm going to use a bonus action, as a Circle of the Moon druid, to use one spell slot to heal 1d8 hit points. Ooh, seven! That's good! Awesome. I'm going to keep him locked down. Sorry, sorry! Sorry, Jesus! There's also a wyvern on my ass. You got that wyvern on my ass! Thanks, man! He's not that cool. Would he get a strike of opportunity on her? Wait, wait. Is it the big bird? He might have reach. It might not be out of his range. Big money, no whammies. That was the cutest thing! There's still the guy on the ground. Right under my face. Get it girl. That was on the critical, right? He was always an asshole! Always. He always had a crush on you! (laughter) Quick bathroom break. It does grant you cock lightning, that's true. It's like a 5th-level spell. Can I scavenge from the ember-roc? Take it. They've all seen us pick our noses. Hey, Mom? I cleaned the dishes. Yes I am. Nature check? Gil, don't fuck me, Gil. Gil, god damn it, Gil. (laughter) Like napalm? Percy, do you have any vials left? Not a gallon, but I just want a couple, and I hand a couple to Vex and Vax. Just a couple vials of the-- Yep, nitroglycerin. You can either make a really great molotov cocktail, or maybe some flaming arrows. But what about Allura? Are you okay? What happened? We thought you were dead for a second. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. What's your name? What's your name? She's been Feebleminded. I turn to Kima. Was it Feeblemind? Yes. It's a restoration spell. I try and calm her as best as I can to help Pike. Any assistance I can provide. Allura, I'm sorry. We should have been those allies, here by your side, and we weren't, and I'm sorry. Yes. It seems it already has. I believe he's still on the wall. You were always mean to us. Why? What did he want? We have the Hat of Disguise. Can you give her the Hat of Disguise? You think he won't care? Wipeout! What does Thordak ultimately want? Okay, we knew that. Well he speaks to his crystals. Well, some dickhead ratted us out. Vox Machina, I'm assuming, considering you left our-- Yeah, we have. Well, the Clasp is clearly working for him now. Well he said the tunnels the Clasp "reigns dominion," so-- Well, I mean, it makes sense, to a certain point. When you have a big enough ego you don't have any more fears, I guess. Here. I give the stone to Vex. I talk to Allura, I guess. Is she there? I would feel terrible leaving everyone again after we gathered everyone. Who cast that spell on you? Feeblemind, that's very high level magic. It was Xanthas? Ah. Be long gone? What happened to using this as our base? Was it only the wyverns and the lizardmen that attacked? Who was in contact with Xanthras? Xanthras? Xanthas? Xanthas. Who was in contact with Xanthas? Zenith. Who was in contact with Xena the Warrior Princess? Then how did he know? Oh, to Daxio. That's not okay. Well, if they have to go through the battleground-- We're sitting ducks here. Out of 200 that were here? Where the fuck is Raishan? Where is Raishan? Allura, you were talking about going to Whitestone. And what were all of your goals, again? All of Allura's goals. Okay, hang on, hang on. What time of day is it? All right. We can gather our most elite. I can get a decent amount of people through if we Teleport Via Plants very quickly, but not all of them. Here's the thing, 55 people walking near Emon is not very covert. And it's clear that there are scouts everywhere; Fort Daxio was off the map until we showed up. No one was watching it until we showed up. But we are what Thordak is watching. We put everyone at risk no matter where we are. To where Syngorn's army is? What's left of the fort? What's undestroyed? Maybe we should have someone on watch. Are we sleeping in the fort? I'm gonna crash as soon as I find something fluffy to fall on. Sure. Yeah. Okay, you know what? I can get us there, and Allura can get us back on the same day. What are we getting at Whitestone? Is Raishan there? And she was getting Asum. You know what? Yeah. Let's go. All right! They're totally great, man! They can just crash on our couch for a few months. The problem is that we've summoned many of our allies to Fort Daxio and they are currently in transit to that current location. Correct. Yes, it does. I imagine whatever he's building. What is he building, do you know? Insight check! What was that? That's okay, 23. What? Right, right, okay. So wait, Tharizdun? Is that another god? Did she say that? I mean, there's some-- I feel like there's not some sort of Voltron thing considering there are more vestiges in the world. Wait, weren't they-- I've got the Scrying Eye. Cashew's kinda mad at us. But Allura can teleport us back and forth. Can he? Scanlan? What do you think? Ah, sure. (laughter) Allura. Hang on, wait, I'm talking to her. I'm not voting; I'm talking to her. (laughter) Allura, I have had destiny pushed upon me since birth. What do you feel is right? Because I'm not sure what to believe anymore. Make this decision for us! But in many ways you've been our leader-- (laughter) Wait, are you trying to use this as an allegory?. Oh. Clarota? Yeah, is he strong enough? Is he all right? Allura. Fucking god dammit, you guys. I'm not making votes here! In many ways, I feel-- (laughing) Jesus Christ. In many ways, I feel we are walking down the path you've already walked. In that case, I feel it's time for new blood, and we've been with Gilmore since the beginning. We need you as an ally back here, we'll keep you on the sidelines as an oracle, and we'll take Gilmore to be by our side. Look, he set me up to make the call, okay! I was trying to follow through, Jesus. I demand a recount! In Pennsylvania and Florida specifically. Are we assuming that we're sleeping after this? Because god damn. That's right, because we bamfed to Whitestone. Never mind.
