New comic! Yes, based off of real events that happened in real life and in game. I think Ashley. But the pitchers is actually how you have to do it, so, but we just didn't post-- it's like the rules are for alcohol commercials. As long as you're not actually physically drinking it, it's fine. And it's got the seal of approval. Yeah, there was a new Super Power Beat Down that came out today where we are challenging Darth Maul versus Spider-man. Because, why not? Why not. But you should check it out because we have a very fun cameo by someone who I don't want to spoil. It's not Sam. No, it's really not. But his name might rhyme with Pan Me. Yes. It rhymes with bahn me. No, it doesn't, actually. The chat room gets it, don't you? His name... yeah! There's a cameo in there. "And I'm sorry." Yeah, like, "Dude! I got you something I like!" Oh, yes, the Boonzy Arts candles. I meant to grab those. The D&D-related candles that I plugged back when we were doing the Slayer's Take episodes forever ago. They had a Kickstarter. They are out now and you can buy them on their website at BoonzyArts.com. Yes, and we have a set that we were going to be doing in a giveaway as well that she delivered that I'll find during break. Tomorrow. At 6AM. Like the Macy's Day Parade. No. But it'll be up that early. Now that we've had an awesome year of amazing Critmases, we've had a few ideas that the Critters actually gave us to focus the idea of Critmas a little bit. Yep. We'll leave it at that. Acid sucks. I never want to encounter acid again. Every time we do, it's bad. It's always bad. Preserves apples. Yep. Probably. That would have been bad. Save versus Uranus? Is that what you said? I was yelling in the earpiece, fuck it, run! What? Why the-- why? I didn't, either! Did your computer die? A payload? He called you a payload. Are we out of the room? (slowly) No, I didn't. Oh, god. Be careful. No, I tried to jam a piece of the magic glass. The jammy magic glass into it and-- I'm probably lucky that I was able to pull away as quickly as I did, because I think it eats everything around it. Still there, yeah. It's doing its really fast spinny thing. I thought I could maybe go into my wildshape and bring down the building, I thought maybe if I collapsed the building, maybe it was drawing some sort of energy from the net of intertwined bodies, but I couldn't, because it was blocking all magic capabilities. Pike! I'm a little shaky. Group hug! Should I stabilize her? Roll high! She's rolling. Is she just unconscious? He's whispering about the Whispered One! Oh boy. Cassandra, is there any reason why they'd want to sacrifice you in particular? (mumbles) You have advantage. Yeah, I prep my fire hands. I reach over and I grab Vex's hand. And I look at her and I say, what do we do? Plus two, it's five. More importantly, what was that just now?! Who were you talking to? What?! Percy, you cannot honestly tell us you don't know anymore! We just watched you have a full-fledged conversation with yourself! Anything further? Yeah, just text her! I wonder what Erevan has to do with this. Go ahead. Sorry, Percy. I'm with Vax, here. You mentioned just now that you wanted your money back. Was this a dream? Did you pay somebody? And with what? Well, clearly it wasn't! Can I do an insight check on him? Fucking fuck! 16. We have to title this "Whispers!" (squeals) I get one, too! Cashed out-say. We're fighting the thing that's been in your head! There's so many allegories! We're fighting the demons in your head. Forever! Since the beginning. 16. I didn't suck it up this game. What? What did you, what was that? No. We're not looking good. So the daggers did it. With the ten, 23. Psychic damage? Ain't no hollaback gnome. What! Okay. Not trusting this guy, I'm going to go ahead and cast Faerie Fire. It's a 20-foot radius. Just right in this bubble that we've been hanging out in. Because I'm assuming he's going to be up in our faces. Yeah, just right, right around us. I'll step back a bit. Step out of it. That's good. Orthax? How dark is it in here? It's like we have body glitter on. You can just move out of the Faerie Fire. It's only a 20-foot radius. No, it's a radius. If you move out of it, you're not in it. And he's in that Faerie Fire, right? So you get advantage, yo. With advantage! So metal. Whoa! Oh, fuck yeah! It's a crit? Oh, right, because that's-- well, it's straight dice rolls. Or does she roll dice twice? Little holy nuke. Times two, right? Whoa! Oh! Yes. He's totally surrounded, pretty much, right? Yeah. I'm actually going to throw up-- I'm going to maintain my Faerie Fire. I'm going to-- yes. TALIESIN and (dry-heaving noises) It's purple. And I say, (slurred) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. (laughing) How tall is the ceiling? I'm going to take a Daylight beam and go (bing) right over top of it like a nice pretty spotlight. It's not, actually. It's an action that lasts for an hour. I looked it up just now. I'll take another step back. That's good. What? 16. Whispers are so exciting. Sweet nothings. Oh, I could have done something about that. Please. He's laughing like it is. Wouldn't that be the third time this has happened? She Misty Stepped, so she turned into air. Tell us where she is. We hear it. I'll take a 12. 25 total. Fuck. Oh. Kill him! Nat 20s all up in this bitch. How about the protection? Take everything. Can I do a nature check to see? Because I think I know what it is. 29.
