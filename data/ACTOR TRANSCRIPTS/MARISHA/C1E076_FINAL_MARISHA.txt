It's a great shirt. It's mine! Tomorrow. So the blue thing is the magical door? Oh, natural 20! I don't know what to do with that in this situation. 22. What are we doing? Where's his friend that he summoned? The little winged thing? Okay, and this guy over here, who's like (growls). Is he angry at us, too? Okay, so he's just like "Fight!" Okay. Is the pit fiend considered huge or large? Large. Okay, and then this is lava? Oh Jesus. I'm shaking. Okay. I'm going to cast Watery Sphere right on their faces. They both have to make strength saving throws. Or else they are restrained. In water. Strength. I'm so nervous! 19. Can I now move it now? It says as an action I can move the sphere up to 30 feet. Okay. It's restrained. Not right now. I'm going to wait. On my good days, I always have bonus shit to do. Can I hug around the corner a little? Hide a bit? Just a little tuck in. Yeah, that's good. That's good. I don't want to like lose too much visual. Yeah, that's good. Yep. Get these fuckers locked down. They're both grappled. That's a Percy roll. What, is he coming for me? That looks like that's what's happening. I tried to make him stupid and I'm sure he realizes that. Technically, I thought you couldn't cast-- I thought it doesn't work with spells. I don't know. SAM and Thought you couldn't just cast two spells. It was only melee attacks-- Aw, thanks, man. I wouldn't understand half of those references. I love whipped cream. It's delicious. Thanks, Scanlan. Talk to the hand. Doesn't she have an evil thing? An anti-evil-people-thing? No? But there's a radius blast thing. (whimpering) Okay. Oh, that's not bad. 21. Oh my god. Okay. My water sphere is still over there? Well, shit. I'm going to drop the watery sphere. I'm going to try and Earthbind this motherfucker. Yep. Try and get him down. Fuck, that's it. He blew my action. Can I try and back away from his crazy presence? I can't see exactly where I am. Is there a way I can tuck inside the little tower that's right there? Sure. Can I move toward them? And tuck into this alcove, maybe? If I move under him? He's only 15 feet? Okay, hang on. He's only 15 feet. Okay, can I try something? He's hovering above this? Can I, as a bonus action, cast Grasping Vine? Right over here? No, sorry. Over here. And I want to try and Grasping Vine and drag his ass into the lava. Yeah, that works. Fuck. This isn't going well. All right, whatever. I'm going to move around, still try and dodge him and tuck in this way. I do have Bigby's Hand. Of what? Plus two to my AC? Okay! Yeah. All right, that hurts. My antlers and my hair! Hey! That was the wing shot? What's he doing? Is he hovering over the lava? Yeah, where is she? Oh. Bitch. You're kind of close to me. You can see me and Grog, and that's pretty much it. Yeah, I am. Thank you! Oh, shit, dammit. Okay, do I have any view on Big Pharma? Okay. Is he peeking off, like if I shifted around, would I be able to see a little? I'm going to try and shift toward you, to see if I can see him around the lava bend. Okay. Can I take my action to go ahead and cast Sunbeam and then hold it until I see him? That's what I want to do. Whenever I see him. Can my sunbeam go through the sphere? Can I please sunbeam first? God dammit, Scanlan. Yeah, he's probably going to save from that too. (lazer zapping) It's a constitution saving throw. That's my DC. No, that's a plus two to spell attack rolls. I can't use my--? It's radiant damage, and he's not blinded. Which would have been so cool. Does he take extra because it's radiant? He takes nine points of damage, by the way. Such a troll tonight! You got your wish! Her body just landed at your feet. It's like Left 4 Dead physics. Heh, yeah. Yep. Does inspiration help negate? All three hit. Just one? Oh that's right, I've got that, at the top of my turn. Okay, first one was 21. Second one's 15. Third one, heh, is a natural one. Okay. Lucky number seven! Come on, winner winner. Okay, I'm going to Sunbeam him again. I'm going to use my bonus action to turn into an air elemental. Right. Just a game of attrition, at this point. Hang on, sorry, trying to do math. (adding) 33 divided in half, so, shit. 11! No, 12! 33? 16! I'm really nervous! I still have movement, right? That's 18 for the first one. Ooh, not good. Not good at all. Seven. Can I use inspiration on that? Plus 12? Another seven! So 14! Okay, and then last one, last one. 13. I don't know. I did, I took it as I went, and then I erased it. Holy shit! Oh, jeez! He has advantage against spells! Magic casters have been useless. That would have been so great. Who's close to her? Do you still have any spells left? The poison spell? Can you drag her in? Yeah, trying to get Scanlan. Yeah, it just made you look real cool. You will die! It doesn't heal, but it should fix poison. All right, I'm going to Sunbeam She-Ra right in the face. Just say, I'm sorry, what's your name? Well, I can fly, so can I scooch around? That's right! For once! All right. So, she's blind, that's the cool part. That's a good roll! Okay, that's 14 plus seven, which is 21. (adding) 29. No, no! 27 plus four is 21. 31. Something. It's a hollow victory. Do I still have any more movement? 85 flying speed. You've got Pike. I want to, can I make it to Big Pharma? I don't remember any of their names. I'm just using the nicknames we've come up with. Ghurrix. Yeah, can I flank him a bit? Yeah, I want to flank. I can fly, though. I can hover. Can I hover and flank? I'll just hover there and look imposing. I'll puff up real big. Are you inside? Holy shit. Good teamwork, good teamwork! Pike? I thought she was already inside? I know. What horror have you brought upon us?! Yeah, we're starting to-- not like this. Starting to drop like flies. I feel like this is a very strong hint from the Dungeon Master. You've had this by your side the whole time? That's real good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on! Come on, bard! Do we try to get in the mansion, or what do we do? Okay, can I, as part of my speed-- I wasn't that high up, I was just hovering above-- can I go down, scoop up Scanlan, and both of us bolt into the mansion? Vex is right on the outside of the door? Right on the outside of the door. Okay, I'm going to swoop down and drag her in. Do I still have an action? I drop my elemental form. And I cast Protection from Poison on her. Thank god I took that! But he can carry it, right? Proof. You've got to trade it for the Dawnmartyr armor. Is there anything else left of him? Didn't he have a symbol on his chest, or whatever? That was a three hour fight. Woo, we didn't die! [break] I am up to 80. These boots appear to actually be boots that my people might have made. They are Boots of Spider Climbing. The wearer can spend an action to cast Spider Climb on themselves, no concentration required. The effect lasts for an hour. Spider Climb lets you-- I go to Percy. He's waving dibs. I thought that the guards were going to show up way sooner. We lucked out. They've got a low response time in this city. They're from Wildemount? You're different, too! There's a very nice city where we came from. Might be able to start a new life there. We don't need to check back in with Senokir. He already has a way to get hold of us. But we can stealth there, get the armor, and then get out. Thank all of us. We did this together! I have just enough room in my spell bus to take us all back. We should probably slave ourselves up again. We don't have to go far. That is weird! I feel like I'm learning so much about you, Vax. We put our chains back on. I take out the necklace and throw it at her feet. Or on the table in front of her. If word has not reached you by now, honestly, I'm quite surprised. Word of mouth. It's a small city. I think you've done enough gambling for today. Would you care if we do a little teleportation spell in your living room? Right, because you've got-- thank you. (chanting) Put it on! Legendary weapons! That's amazing. We got all of our legendary weapons. TRAVIS and Okay, let's go home. To Fort Daxio? We can come back for him. I gave him a bracelet. He knows where we are. I gave him the bracelet so he knows where to find us. As soon as we kill Thordak, we'll come back and make good on our word. Well, if we go back, though, what if he wants to cash in right now? I gave him the bracelet. Deliberately. Yeah, remember, we're dragging children everywhere we go. Look, he mentioned, "Let me give you a trinket in case you all leave so I can find you again." But he's expecting it. All right. I guess we can talk to him. I'm just afraid he'll try and cash in on it right now and not let us leave. How far of a walk is it? All right. What's in the box? (laughter) I think we misjudged him. If you ever find yourself in the Material Plane and need a tour guide-- Just, you know where to find us. I gave you that bracelet. We have your card. We're good. Yeah, we know. Wait, Senokir, before you do that, is it safe for us to teleport out of here? You won't mind? Okay. Let's go. Fort Daxio? Yeah. We all join hands with the kids. It's one big fatty spell. Me and eight. So let's go! (teleporting sounds) How long were we gone? Do you have any rough estimate? How long was I out for, man? Oh god, yeah. How many people did we gather? I hope so. I hope we didn't put all of our eggs in one basket and then burn the omelet. Yeah. Thanks for coming! MARISHA, SAM, and
