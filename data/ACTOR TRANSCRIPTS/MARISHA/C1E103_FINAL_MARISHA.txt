Tell your friends! Tell your wives! Boosting Taliesin! They're peppered in between. The beauty of that is you're not sure which ones are true and which ones aren't! They're back and forth. The bees are true. It's so good! I feel like we invented a new form of theater; it's weird. SHIPMATES. Until tomorrow. Adam Lawson was the director. Sean and I were the producers. Disintegrated. I saw it happen, and then I saw it happen. No, we brought-- That's the ultimate question, isn't it? I've never done this before. I recently learned a spell that I could attempt, but it's nothing I've tried before, and it's expensive, and I'm already terrified of the fate and the hell that I might have brought him in his final moments. I think he saw himself die. I think. I'm so sorry. I cast Foresight on him. And I think there was a thing for a second. I haven't thought of those ramifications of something like that before. I think he was held and there was nothing he could do. What if that happened? What if he saw himself die? I need 25,000 gold pieces worth of diamonds. I need 25-- We're in the Feywild. Do not touch it, Percy! Keyleth goes over to Vex and curls up into her. What? I don't know. I half-heartedly do a Gust cantrip while still sitting next to Vex. I seem them moving in that direction, and once again, poof for them. Even beyond the diamonds. This was supposed to be a weekend trip. Just a weekend trip. Even after we find 25,000 gold pieces worth of diamonds, I've never brought anyone back before, and this is versus the Raven Queen. How do we know if his soul is even available for return? Maybe we should talk to the Raven Queen. Same way that he did. Maybe our werewolf friends are still around. We don't have a body, so we're basically making a diamond Vax. I can make animals. I can make animals. What did Kraghammer mine? What was their deal? What if we go to a mine? We could go straight to a source, buy direct? We can't. We have to sleep before, unless there's a portal nearby that we can get through. It has to be nearby. Plane Shift is general. I pick an area, and it gambles where it's going to drop us. I did! I said the Shademirk Bog and the pond, the glade. I found the page in my notes and rambled all the names off very quickly in a panic. Didn't we-- nope. I Plane Shifted us out. (horrified wail) No! No, don't consider it Pike, no! 31? All of us? What do you want to do with Delilah? They like us now. Yeah. We cuddle between the armor. That's the saddest thing. Jacking off. Oh man. Don't die forever. You don't want to be exhausted. How long does he have to rest so he's not exhausted? Is this your nymph? We're asleep? What's going on, Pike? Pike, I need you to tell me before I come around this corner and see. I am not coming with you until you tell me, Pike. I clutch onto Vax's armor. Will you come here for a second? Okay. I could hear everything that's going on because it's down the tree. No, I'm super not okay. What's going on? What the fuck is going on?! Fuck all of you! For a fucking second, just tell me. I have his armor. Okay. You go first. I'll follow you. I follow her down. Does he feel cold? Is it you? I thought I killed you. I could have done more. You're cold. I put my ear up to his chest. Natural 18. 24. Okay. I give him back the armor. Percy. How long do we have you? What do you remember? Anything? No, we fucking can't! As far as I'm concerned, you can drop dead in front of our faces right now, and it wouldn't be much different than the past 24 hours. We saw her face. Surprise. Wait. What? I gave you back your armor and shit. He's got a cloak over him. You're here until the job's complete, right? Or she feels that you've paid your service, I feel like I remember you telling me in bedside chat at some point in time over the 15 months? Or is your soul yours again? Are her deals final? So that's it? Your purpose is to make sure that the rest of us find long, happy lives at the cost of your own? We need to talk to the Raven Queen. We need help. I don't accept this as a closed contract. Does he get a bonus to AC? Streaker's sprint. I admire how you're really sticking to that. I'm in awe. I'm impressed. Attempt to resurrect you. Don't worry about it. We should probably get back very quickly, before too much time passes. We've already slept here. Vasselheim? The guy who messed with us for three days? Is it possible? I thought gods were supposed to be all omnipresent and whatnot. Knock, knock, hello? I bamfed into your universe. I don't know. I do like New Vax's tenacity. It does immediately become the concern that I can't get us anywhere unless I have some sort of item, generally a tuning fork or some sort of attuned item to that plane to get us there. You said your god, the Raven Queen, she's the one who transitions people. Maybe she can help. Does that mean I should go talk to Melora? I feel like when you're in the same clique, when you're on the same level, everyone talks, right? So we have a short list, is what we're saying. Do we each get different suits, matching suits, but in different colors? God powers? Put her on our to-call list. Is it better to do that here or on the Prime Material Plane? Or does it really matter? Also, the longer we're here, potentially, the more time gets wonky. Okay, let's go. I immediately look around in a 360, very quickly. Does there look like any big cities that should not be here? 19. What? Wisdom saving throws? Am I? (laughs) Yeah, bringing it back. In the long run, I think this is going to be better for you. Do we need to stop by the temple of the Raven Queen? Okay. Do you want a teammate to go with you? Do you want to pick someone? Where was the Melora grove thing? That we buried Senokir's wife's ashes. Where is that? But it's here? Should I go talk to Melora? Should I go try and recruit Melora? Team Sarenrae and Team Melora? I'm just trying to save time. This is great, Pike. Is this how you learned all of your stoneworking stuff? It's good, like a druid could do it. It's very impressive. Good craftsmanship. I didn't realize how crazy it sounds until you say it out loud. She just gave us a key! Do I recognize what it is? She gave us a key to Plane Shift there. This is the tuning fork that I needed. Hang on. Do other gods live there? Three mimosas later, and three hours later... (slurring) And he totally didn't call us back! And I told him I'm not getting back together again. Did I figure that out with my check, or no? Yeah, how much time has it been? It's frozen! It's the same day we left? Oh, cool! We lucked out! Yay! Amazing work. If you need any landscaping done, don't be afraid to ask. Pike can get you in touch with me. Yeah, it's fine. We know people. You were with him as Tary! They did that, not us! Fighting gods one day, getting arrested in the street the other day. You are at 27. Wait. Nope, I lied. How many points? You're at half. You're at 13 hit points. Normally, I'm the one who's arrested. Mixing it up. Is this wisdom? Well, they have keen sight, so they have advantage on wisdom checks, and the wisdom is plus two. Although, don't you maintain-- So plus two, and you have advantage. They just have advantage on perception checks. Do you think that guy went and alerted everyone about Vecna? Probably Vecna. Vecna's a much bigger problem, right? Did you get allegiance from the Lord of the Crossroads? Right? You were gone for what, 45 minutes? Melora doesn't exist on that plane. No. The Fire Ashari. Why? Alerting the cities. No. All right, let's mist there. Misting to the Fire Ashari is not that long, right? That's what I thought. A couple of hours. Maybe we should Tree Stride there. I take that back. We Tree Stride. Transport Via Plants. I always say that wrong. Tree Stride's a 5th-level spell. Tree Stride. I have a lot of stuff going on. I immediately look for Cerkonos, tell him what happened, light the fire orbs. The chaos orbs. Crisis orbs. The city-- Thar Amphala. LAURA and I believe it teleported somewhere in the northern hemisphere. Somewhere in a cold region. We think Wildemount. You might want to check in with our contacts there. They might have the best knowledge. Well, that's why we're alerting you first. Possibly worse. After this, I'm retiring. We are going to be going to the blessed fields of Elysium from here. Thank you. Okay, he might not be in Wildemount. I don't know. 350 miles northwest. If you speak to the other Ashari and my father, let him know. Thank you, Cerkonos. Kaitiaki. Let's go. Do we need anything else? It's a good plane of existence. Let's just give Vecna the Prime Material Plane. Let's stay here! New plan. New plan stay here. You're going to be at AX! Also, Meg and Wendy are going to have a booth there, so you can go to Artists' Alley. I think they said 11am? Go onto their Twitter. But anyway, they're going to be there. I've lost my druid die! Actually, Max! Is this still a thing? Apparently the Critters got you ice cream. Someone got you ice cream. Ben and Jerry's. Our producer is gone.
