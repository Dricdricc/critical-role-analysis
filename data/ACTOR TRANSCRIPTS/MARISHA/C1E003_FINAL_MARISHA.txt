Yes! Hello, I am Marisha Ray, and I am Keyleth of the Air Ashari tribe. And I am the Circle of the Moon druid. Level nine. (laughs) I'm a dad. I love those. I also bend down and slap him a few times. (all laugh) Ohh. I think I might-- Anything we should know? I-- I think I have a spell. That might be able to help. I don't know it right now though. We'd have to take a break. I'd have to pull out my books and relearn it. It takes some time. Need to sleep on it. Oh my gosh. Thanks, guys! And donuts! Brain twerk? A little warning next time! It's like a Three Stooges act. Oh! Wait! Ask her if she's seen Nostoc. Or if they've seen-- Or, yeah, if they've seen our paladin friend. Our little-- Lady Kima! We're going to kill your god. Wait. Fuck it, just go with it! (all laugh) Yes. Do we have any idea what time it is? All right. I want to check out-- I'm gonna take the first watch-- I still have a lot of reading to do, and I can go ahead-- I'm gonna go ahead and cast-- Make sure everybody's in! Everybody's in. Anti-Life Shell? A shell that keeps in anything from coming in. (laughs) He'll try anything. (laughs) Oh, Scanlan. (laughs) It goes pew pew! It's a pew pew stick! Cool! Make sure everyone's in and close by, and get done with everything. I'm gonna take you guys-- I'm gonna cast Anti-Life Shell. That way everyone at least gets one good hour of sleep. Ugh, wish Pike were here. Eight? So pretty! I go ahead and I take a piece of paper from my spellbook, and I take a piece of charcoal, and I just scroll over top of it. To get an imprint of it. I take a few pieces of paper, and I kind of glue them together- (all laugh) -- and then I get a really big one, and then I roll it up. And I have my Anti-Life Shell up. Who is taking the next watch? Just, the party is taking turns being like, so pretty! It's above our-- How's it going over there, Grog? It's good. Religion. Religion. Oh no. Okay, but let's-- Am I awake? Are we awake? Did you wake me up? Why water? Why would you do that? Why couldn't you just touch me? Ugh. Stop! I'm okay. Okay, do we wanna stay here? Do we wanna do this here? Tiberius-- I don't know. But I want us to be as safe as we can. Tiberius, can you lift us up on your pillars, or like, encase us in, or something? Make us a room? Make us a room? Yes? Okay. We're gonna do this. Yes, if you could. Scanlan, give me some nice meditation, some-- Some, like, pure moods. Yes! Yes. I go ahead-- I go ahead and light some incense. Scanlan. Scanlan, do you still have that deity, that little idol of Pike? Can we just have that out just so I have her energy. Just feel like I need her. Okay. Let's not go there. No need to be naked. I'm so nervous. I'm literally shaking. Okay, I just kind of lay my hands on his forehead. Do I get an inspiration die from him or anything? Okay. What am I rolling? What do I do? Gah. Nauseous. No. Where's the inspiration die? Where's the inspiration die? It's a d8, right? Do I get advantage on this, since I'm taking time? I do have advantage on this? Oh, that's much better! I'm still gonna do the inspiration dice, just in casies. Okay, that's good. Okay, so. 17 plus 12. Plus six, plus six with my wisdom modifier. My heart is pounding. So that's 30? No, 29. Ah, I'm still shaking. Grog? Grog! Ow. Just glad you're all right, Grog. Really glad you're awake. To Grog! At like the gym and you need some alcohol, after that. Good, he's back, you guys. He's back. Good. Oh, thank you. I had Pike in mind. I channeled her energy. Yeah well, that's a bit of a side effect. That's part of the Greater Restoration, a few things get restored. Woohoo! I'm going to let the twins stealth ahead. So we can only assume that, what was his name? Yeah. Much worse. Well, we also have this K'varn, who is experimenting on all those creatures, so we can't even attest for any of this. Yeah, parts of one. It could be a hodge-podge of everything So she's been here. That's for your wisdom. Intelligence. It would be Enhance Ability, essentially. I'll tell you. I think it's wisdom. No, no, no, it's intelligence. Because I think it's like owl's wisdom for wisdom. Yeah, you have advantage on intelligence checks. So it wouldn't necessarily-- It wouldn't make your intelligence higher, and it wouldn't necessarily help with your vulnerability. Well it's about, like, having high-- it's not necessarily being smart, it's about having resistance to willpower. Right. Well, we sort of know what we're going into. Hang on. Okay, so here's my question. So we've already fought two things where we can't look at them and they mess with our heads. So is there something we can do going forward-- Or like-- I like Magneto's helmet! Or even if we-- Do we have a bunch of mirrors? Or where we can look through things with reflections. Kind of like a Medusa's gaze thing. You know, where you like look in the reflection. Right. Yeah. It would just be about making us less vulnerable to the mind-- That's true. I mean, I can cast Enhance Ability to help our willpower? Or our will. Hey, dungeon master? Asking as the dungeon master. If I cast Owl's Wisdom on people, it gives people advantage on wisdom checks. Would that count on saving throws against willpower? Would it help anything? Would, would any advantage to wisdom under Enhance Ability help some? Right. And for the brains it was versus willpower. Yeah! And don't forget about our charity, 826LA, which helps children be literate and write stories well. What? I don't know if I have anything. Let's get it done. 15. Do I see any-- are there any bats? I failed. I was gonna see if they're in the-- Were you guys trying to stealth? Is that what happened? (whispers) Hey, hey, what do you guys see? You're cutting out. I can't hear you Okay. It's a racial bonus. Okay. Holy shit. What are we going to do? I give Scanlan some water from my water skin. I've heard rumors of those. Can we make a check for those? Did you see Lady Kima? Can I meditate to see if I know anything about this-- Yeah, what the hell? Thanks chat room! An illithid. Illithid, with a D or a T? But I've never heard them called a mind flayer, but I guess they could be called a mind flayer. But we call them Illithids. I didn't know they were real, though. But Scanlan, didn't you also say that they were, like, levitating? Can we have Tiberius standing there to just Firebolt it? I think I've heard that one. That puppet show. Flying from the-- Okay, okay, hang on, hang on. So, let's have a failsafe in case a few get across the bridge. Illithid. We really just need someone to keep them from running through that tunnel. We need some way to keep them from coming-- going-- Oh, oh, oh! Wait, wait. I actually have a spell, while I was reading through my book last night, catching up on spells that I kinda forgot about. I learned something called Hallucinatory Terrain, where I can make the entire terrain look like whatever I want. Other terrain. What I can do, is-- I can make the chasm look like it's solid ground-- I can make the tunnel across the way look like it's caved in. Are you good with hauling ass? Okay. As long as you can haul ass. Before Liam-- before Vax leaves-- Go ahead. Before Vax leaves, I just put my hands on his shoulders, and I cast Enhance Ability on him, and give you a dexterity boost. So you have advantage on all dex rolls. You have the advantage-- -- on all dex rolls. If that comes to that. Ability checks. I hope this works. I'm gonna be-- Can I be like halfway in between on the bridge? Is that a bad idea? I can turn into a bird. My-- which one? It's a concentration thing. So, as long as I can keep it up. Oh. Yeah, for up to 30-- 24 hours, actually. It's not a concentration spell. 300 feet. 150 square feet. And it looks, sounds-- -- smells, like some other sort of natural terrain. So, what I'm doing, whenever we-- can I make it look like there's a cave-in happening through the tunnel? Well, that's what I'm gonna do. Yeah. What I'm gonna do, I just want the terrain to look, on my side-- I want the terrain to look exactly like what it is, but I just wanna stretch it out a little bit, so it looks like they've got, like, an extra running space. Yes. Of actual, yes. Like the bridge is an extra 40 feet away. Okay. Then I'll do that. Then I'm gonna just-- you know what, I'm gonna stay on the opposite side of the bridge, and I'm gonna focus on making that illusion. Yep. Thank you! Yes, be careful guys, please be careful! Mm-hm. All right, I'm on the outside of the bridge. I'm out with them. Gone. Yeah. Are you convincing yourself or are you-- Yeah, I'm with you guys. We're fine. That's perfect. Come here, bitches Just watch your step! Yeah, isn't he on the fake ground? The lich? (groans) Oh, no. Are you on the carpet, Vax? Son of a bitch. Use them dex saves! You've got advantage! Holy shit. He's like catatonic. Come on, Tiberius. Bye, carpet. I loved that carpet, damn it. It's just a carnival game for Percy at this point. So how many (monster sounds) are over there ? And how many duergar left? How many-- After they fell into-- Come on, Percy. Like fish in a barrel. Okay. Oh! Go! Carpet! Ah, fly me down with you. Tiberius and I are going to fly down. On the carpet. Yes. That's true. I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight that guy. I don't know. Okay, take me down-- Hang on, let me, let's go see, let's go see. I've-- to ride the carpet down to the bottom with Percy and Tiberius. Right. Me and Percy are on the carpet. Do I see any tunnels, or areas that look like it leads someplace of interest? I keep going. Are you done? Okay. I say, Tiberius, give me some light? And I take-- and I cast Control Water, and I just take the pool-- the water in the bottom of the pool, and I bend it, and I part the pool, and I take it and I cascade it all the way up, following the lava flows. I can part seas with this. Oh, okay, okay. Well I'm taking-- okay. I don't necessarily part it, but I take the water, and I draw it up, cascading along the edges following all the lava streams going into the tunnels. I'm gonna kind of push it, you said there was a tunnel kind of going up into Cthulhu side? There's a waterfall. But there's like a tunnel kind of carving out that way? Okay, I take all of the water, and I really just concentrate, and I gather just a big tube, and I push it down that tunnel. I'm sorry, that lava cave just looks important. Yeah. Okay, okay. Also, it looks like there's something eating those trolls. Yeah. I agree with Vex on this one. Yeah, look what it did to you! I think you were at least 150 feet across that bridge when he did that to you. But the bridge was like 250 feet across, right? Tunnels that go deeper! And I can control water for at least an hour. It lasts a while. I'll go with Vex that-a-way. I can cool lava as we go. We can go in there! I can make that stop happening. I'm just-- I would much rather face random beasts who are just random beasts, than mind flayers who can suck my brain out. I think-- I don't think a boss battle-- I don't think we can fight this guy and win! Water holes! Tiberius, you haven't voted! A Draconian-- you come from a political family! Okay, well, if this doesn't work, we're going to the tunnel. Can't-- wait, wait, wait. Why can't, why can't Vex and I just, at least, go check it out before we do this? (sighs) Let's do it! Fuck it! They don't control us! Let's do it. We're going. Yes. We're just checking it out! We're coming back! We're coming back. Just wait ten god damn minutes. I take the river flow, where the water's flow is coming out of this waterfall-- -- and I reverse it. Okay. Oh, I can! I go into a black panther form. Panthers have, like, advantage on stealth, something like that? 16. 13. So 16 plus whatever-- -- the dex of the panther is. No, it's whatever the dex-- it's gonna be like-- It's gonna be like 20 or something like that. Plus four. No, plus six. No, we were scouting. You can't take our carpet, we're on the carpet. Oh, that's right. We did transform. Okay, sure, you can take the carpet. Can I do a nature check to see what the scratch marks look like? If they look like any type of beast I might recognize. Any type of residue, any type of slime? They're telling us not to be stupid because we don't have support. Should we be stupid? Right. Why don't we just go back maybe to the entrance of the-- What is she-- what do they look like? I drop to my knees and I look at him and just say, it's okay, we're friends. I take my Druidcraft and I just make a little flower. And there's a pretty little tulip and I lay it at the edge of the barrier. With disadvantage? Okay. Nine. I'm not a very charismatic person. We don't want to die either. Let's not die together. Come on, Vex. (meekly) Hi. You found the right motley crew. (all laugh) Would you like to come with us? Meet our friends? We have friends. Tiberius-- We did! See! Friends! This is-- What's your name? Can we call you Clarence for short? Okay! Clar-ota I'll fly. You can even maybe call them friends, even? Ally. This is the guy we've needed this whole time! So if we did it-- We should also have him help us in your-- 18? Yes! Let's talk about that. Sorry we had to rebel, you guys. Sorry! It was for a good cause! We definitely need one for Grog. We have to get him to make us hats for Grog. Yeah. Just google it.
