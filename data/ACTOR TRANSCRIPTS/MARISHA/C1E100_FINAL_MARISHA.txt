And of course, the latest, Jon Heder. There's so many. Watch him on the Wednesday Club. Shameless plug. No, it's okay. As a lot of people already probably know, we announced it in our press rollout, but in honor of the hundredth episode, we now have episodes zero-- which is all of our backstories-- through ten in podcast form. Critical Role podcast. And then what's going to start happening is, towards the end of the month, we want to start rolling out one a day, on work days. Five a week. Don't kill us. All right? Every day to catch up, 'til we get back on track. There's a podcast. Yes, and Google Play, and yeah. The stuff like that. So, The Slayer's Cake-- the members of The Slayer's Cake-- Yes, have a new product they have just released. Well... I think, you know, they worked so hard on making a commercial, so we should let them-- So here is a commercial from The Slayer's Cake. Bumper VO. The Slayer's Cake, open till 6PM, 7 on weekends. Closed Thursdays for adventuring. Slayer's Cake aprons available now. What? We have aprons? Tary, you didn't tell me we have aprons! (cheering) I know, I know! It's fine, it's fine. Don't worry about it. I'm taking that one. Give it to Heder, give it to Heder! Completely outdated, immediately. Jeff Lewis. Everyone knows him and loves him from the Guild. Check it out. Or as Waluigi. He's been so many things. Everyone knows who Jeff Lewis is. Go watch it. I don't understand. There's not a lot of shade. It's noon. Yeah, yeah. Where in Ank'harel? Do I know anyplace that's near? Okay. I'll do the oasis. Go, go! Six seconds, go! Go, go! Have you been hugged in a year? Has anyone given you a hug? I give him a hug. No, I'm just giving you a hug! Can I use my Inspiring Leader feat? You know what, guys? Human contact's important, you know? So come on, come on, let's all group hug! Group hug! I keep trying to grab Vex. Come on! Come on, hug it out! Brought her out of her comfort bubble. What was the guy's name again? Doran. You got a haircut! I love it. 'Throning'. I don't know if she was referring to monetary wealth, but sure. There's a fowl district? You're good, you're good. Who was out of healing potions? I have four on me. I made a few over the break, if we want them. I'm gonna hand another one to Percy. So wait, can he combo-use that and be like fine wine and chug it? I actually do have a necklace. I have an old necklace. I had an old card that was the necklace that gave +1 to attack and damage while-- All right. Sorry your employer overruled me, Kord. Or Card. Or Chode. He likes it when you're super chill and casual with him, so be cool. (mouths) Just go with it. That's pretty chill, yeah. You know that intimate hug we had earlier? Kinda do that. It's part of the initiation. The tree appreciates it. If you could maybe potentially help me, Meat Man. Why were you just talking like the Meat Man? You've been there. Were there trees? They looked dead? They were dead? Like very dead? I think so? Right? Would you prefer to be a cloud? I could be a cloud, but I'm gonna blow a 7th-level spell for it. Ten? Let me see. But I've already used my 6th-level spell to Transport Via Plants. That's what I'm saying. So I'm gonna have to use a 7th-level spell to do it. So we can do that, but then we might wanna rest. Or we can do some scouting, take a look. I won't be completely tapped out. Ready? Ready? Everybody join hands, join hands, join hands. Poof! Does it look like it's natural decay? How far-- we're still clouds? Starting to go into the entrance. Are we going to go on foot from here? I'll wait 'til we get closer. From up here, does the mountain formation look like it's naturally formed, or like some sort of other event? Is it seismically formed? Oh, not good. What's my nature? Okay, 16. Happy accidents. Does it look deliberate, or does it look natural? Natural 19 from Gil. 22. Cover for me. I'm gonna drop down and do a Commune With Nature. Can Lionel and I commune together and do bonuses? Can I be like, can you call your ducks? All right. You know, it's okay. How deep is the cave-in? That's a good one, that's a good one, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I have a similar problem when I try to talk to cows. They have face-blindness. Is there another entrance into this cavern? Are there other entrances? Is that two including this entrance? Well, there is another one. It's good, it's fine, it's good. In fact, I can double down on this. Can I now do my Commune With Nature and see if I can map out this cavern and find the other entrances? Where are the other two entrances to this cavern? Can I-- hang on-- around the path. Okay. How deep is the Ziggurat from here? Can I sense the other Ziggurat? Okay. What else? What's the last one? What should I do? Yeah, yeah, yeah, can I sense any other maraudering douchebags? Humanoids? What about humanoids? Shit. Do they look like cultist-y people? What? I don't know. I said there's all these cool cult people. Yeah, they could leave. A decent amount of people. A lot of people. There's another entrance nearby, I think further down this path. It's close. What? What do you mean? She went where? I think there's also an entrance at the top of this spire, if we want to do a downward approach, but that seems risky. You know, I think it's right around that direction. Follow the gasping. It feels like it's really close to the gasping. I wonder if there's another face behind the cave-in. Wait, into the cave-in, or the illusory wall? I can Dispel Magic still. Well, there is a second entrance. One is up top. I can clear out the cave-in. I imagine if someone is trying to cause an intentional cave-in, they're anticipating no one going through that cave-in, and we can start there. But they do know about the up. He said there was a face. Hang on, hang on. There are three entrances the cave-in, the one where Vex just got exploded, and one through the top of the spire. If we go through the cave-in entrance, I can clear it out. I will clear one of my last high-level spells, but Lionel knows his way through that way. But I can clear it tonight. Can we camp out inside? Oh my god, we have the mansion! Oh, no. Maybe this is the unused entrance. Maybe the cave-in is the more recent. I could attempt it. I have Dispel Magic with me right now. All right. I'll do it. I'm trying to dispel the magic. I'm having Vex be like, tell me where it is. Can I prepare it so as soon as I poke my head in, I can be like (dink)! (poof) Bail. Bail! Bail! Out! Can I peek my head back in and do a... 26. I'll go. Like snow? Or ash? Can I dip down and grab a bit of it and do a nature check on it? Is it ash? 15. Can I just do a little, I'm going to scoop up a little bit and say, Percy, can I get a little bit of water added onto this? Can I do another nature check on what this is? I get down on my hands and elbows. Where are they? I scootch a few more inches and use my last two 3rd-level spells. Just my straight modifier? Don't fuck me Gil! Okay, that's good, that's good. 19 on the first one. 18 on the second one. Okay, we're good! Natural 19. Yeah. That's a 34 total. You guys go. I'll wait here just in case. Holy shit, a brand new Tesla is coming this way! Okay. Hey, we have people. We have people coming this way, about six of them. Just letting you know, probably going to be some fighting coming up, and that is your update from the Voice of the Tempest. It's not a bad idea. We can hold them off. And Percy. I'm just going to say, Pike? Pike, I think we've got some undead coming our way. Probably going to need some Divine Smiting. As I call Pike, I'm going to go ahead and be like, here we go. (boom). Fireball. I can see them, right? They're close enough? Okay. Out of the spire. Okay. Fireball is... Hang on, wait, I'm not a sorcerer. I should've had this prepared. I admit I should've had this. It's something d8? d10's? Fireball. 8d6 fire damage. One, two, three, four, five, six, give me two more. A 19 and a 20? That's a lot. 21, yeah. I reroll ones. (counting) 34 damage. We're here. Hey, Pike? Hold that order for that divine smiting. We're going to need it probably in a second. I think there's going to be more. (singing) Scanlan, open the door. How hot does a campfire normally get? Not that hot, right? Oh no. Something bad. Hey, Pike? Fire. Fire is very white. White fire. Okay. It's been a while. You've redecorated. Only salads? I take all the mirrors off the roof of our bedroom while he talks with Scanlan, and then we go to sleep. I assume. We're okay. We have Pike. Not all skeletons are like ducks. Can we put some rum in it? To a pina colada. But we have a sound guy who's like-- That's what sound guys do. I approve of this so hard. Happy 100th. Wait, did you frame it like a coupon book? That's very impressive. Like a couple on Valentine's Day. Who forgot it was Valentine's Day. Does it sound like skeletons, or heavier? We're inside a glowing door, I think they know where we are. No one's home! We're out of candy, no trick-or-treating. 24. Table right is hanging back behind the twins. Oh, new chest. We could put our blankets in it. I was going to say, the quilt from your grandmother. While they drag the bodies back, Percy and I take the robes. Can I study one of the guys' face, and take that for Alter Self? Yeah, yeah, it's aged a little. Wait, does that require attunement? There's a codeword? 29. 20 total? No one's rolled initiative. No one knows we're here yet. If you can wait 60 seconds, I can make us an elemental. That's a good question. I have a mild confession, and maybe I should have said this a little earlier, but I'm going to say it now. One night, I might have sneaked down into the middle of the ziggurat, and I stuck my hand in it. Well, I wanted to find out what would happen, and I found out it's real bad. It's really bad, is what I found out, and it nearly crushed my hand to a point of oblivion and I think I got really lucky, so I think it just crushes anything that it tries to suck in. It is. I think your arrow happened to be tiny and fast. That's all I mean. Don't jump in. I wanted to summon an elemental. I go with Percy, since we have the robes over top of us. Natural 20. If only it was for something a little more important, but it's fine. 22, tied with Scanlan. Oh god. Okay. I am going to, under the cult hood that I have, transform my face with Alter Self into Sylas Briarwood. Her husband. Her dead husband. I'm going to have his face, and I'm going to walk forward and say, Delilah. Don't. It is me. Deception? This is not good. I'm not good at this shit. Oh, that's not bad! 14? That's it. 14. That's all I got. 14 is good for me. Movement and a bonus? (sighs) I am going to take my bonus to ignite my form into a fire elemental and rush towards the closest thing to me. Yeah. I don't know. Where are we? Okay, I have a 50-foot movement. I want to hit as many skeletons as I can by running through them and catching them on fire. What am I against? Hit. Yep. So five. Miss. No, hit. Armor class is 13. Miss. Miss. Hit. Yep. I can take it. I'm into this. I can fire hover? Is that including me, or no? Okay. Can Keyleth clothesline him on the way up as a fire elemental? Hits. Hits. 13 is my armor class. 11, so I'm at 52. So 19 points total? That brings me exactly to zero. I drop form. Just form. I tanked that motherfucking fight, y'all. I'm still on the ceiling, right? Scanlan! Ceiling and floor? Yeah! 23. Okay. How many people are still on the ceiling with me? Okay. I drop form. I'm going to look around and go, (nervous laughter) and drop my staff and do Fire Storm radiating out from me, and I want to try and avoid Lionel and Grog, but basically radiating out, fire floods the ceiling. Everyone but the two skeletons? No, fuck the casters. What a dick! I get to reroll ones. (counting) 26. Roll two more. 12 more damage. What did I just say? 26, plus 12 more. 38 damage. Can I move any? Can I back out of wherever I am? Where am I? I'll stay. Let me back out of it. Yeah. Yeah. It's okay. I'm fine. No! Bitch! This is my karma! I might be able to do a Greater Restoration on you, but I don't know if I can help you there. It was a restoration spell. You've always ever said that. The blackguard, yeah. What fucking spell is this? Four skeletons on me? Miss! We're upside-down on the ceiling. I'm like, you know how to spell, Lionel! I'm so impressed. How much do I get? Be aggressive. Don't fuck me, Gil. Ooh, that's not great. I'm going to go ahead and roll my inspiration. That's better. 12. I'm okay. I'm all right. How much? 31? I can fix it. Just give me a hot second. Who's left on the ceiling with me? Two skeletons? That's it? And one fucking cultist? Oh my god. A lot of things have changed in a hot second. Okay. What's going on right now? Where's Delilah? I mean, why not? Go big or go home. I'm going to burn my 9th-level Shapechange and go... I'm going to go red dragon? And that's all I can do, right? I'm a dragon on the ceiling. He does. He had to pack a lot of stuff because of me. I feel mildly guilty. Can I move, (impacts) giant dragon walking on the ceiling, and then look down at Delilah backwards and upside down and say, hello! No, yes. Yeah, I do. I can't see her. I have Frightful Presence for anyone who might be terrified of me. That's it. What's that against? 19. Versus wisdom save. They went into the thing! They're gone forever! If she went in the tiny thing. I still have Shapechange for another hour. Wait, did she cancel my spell, or is it just the orb that's done? So, what? What? So it's only a dark magical, anti-magical field because she wants it to be?! Which means-- She can change it! So, it's just very strong magic which makes her change what it is? All of their magic was necromantic. I can. Wait, before we go. Pike, does Sarenrae know anything about this? Anything? Is it just like this now? Like the ziggurat in Whitestone? The last time I put my hand in the sphere when it was black it nearly tore me apart. We could try again. Keyleth goes over to Pike and puts her palm on her head and casts Greater Restoration. The amount you've saved us. It's nothing. I've learned it from you. No. Sorry, I was answering a different question. Continue. What time is it? 1241! Oh my god! A lot to unpack, there. The eight characters on this side of the table.
