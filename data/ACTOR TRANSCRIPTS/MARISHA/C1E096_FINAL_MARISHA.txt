I wonder if she'll be nice and tanned. Oh, that's true. That's true. Do you use Charlie to clean up the shavings? Yeah, Jodie. Yeah, like what are the Eisners? And why Eisner? And why do we care? It was Hannah Mahoney. It was good. You should watch it. She's got a cool name. Yeah, Hannah Mahoney? That's a dope name. But yeah. Go check it out. Yeah, most definitely. And we're filming again soon. We're filming soon. Maybe someday Sam will come on. Maybe someday Bailey will come on. Maybe someday Ashley will come on. It's a mystery. I just assumed you're not interested, 'cause you've never been. I still wanna make Sportsball, but you won't let me. I wanna make it with you. See? He says no. How about this? Will you come on Signal Boost, and we can do a pseudo-pilot test of Sportsball with Signal Boost? Would you do that? See? And he wonders why I didn't ask. Wow. Wait, is it a cube? It is not a cube. Is it? Nope, can't get that from LDN. Cannot promise that from Legendary. Nope. Not for a Twitch show. If you make it an Alpha show, then I can get you money. (laughter) They know it's true. Just like we all know our logo looks like a weed shop sign. We all know it's true. I should probably stop saying this stuff. It might be a breach of contract. Let's keep going. (laughter) Maybe keep an eye on them, make sure they don't have sticky fingers. Talk to Wilhand? Percy? I have a question. Ogden, in his ramblings, mentioned a shadowy figure with burning coal eyes. This doesn't sound like anything that you're familiar with, does it? How did Orthax take his form with you? No glowing eyes. But you think it might still be of the same fiendish nature? Should we bring Wilhand back here? Well, how about you guys go on your tour-- Yeah, theoretically. Yeah, just a little. Just so when historians look back, and they want a detailed timeline of our lives. We'll see you in 24 hours. You're making a Derby hat. That's appropriate. I turn to JB real quick. Oh. My question has been answered by their arrival, so never mind. It was "How long does Ogden take to get ready in the morning?" But now I know. Hey, Vax? Yeah, I'm sitting next to you. There's no ceiling. I think he fell asleep with his eyes opened. You know, I heard a recipe the other day for a beer-mosa. It's like a mimosa, but with beer and orange juice. Would you like a beer-mosa, Ogden? Okay. Okay. You know, I'm kind of sad I'm missing this tour with you guys, now. Yeah. It's gonna be fun. What did we do? We're the worst! We are consistently the worst. Keyleth bows and I take Vax with me by hitting the back of his knees. Oh, she's coming with us. You're on your own. I don't think you want to do a goose-step. You sure? Okay! Have fun! Yes, and Grog is like sherpa-ing. We're gonna go find Wilhand! We're gonna go find Willhand! Is he wearing like a Lolita hat? Is that what's going on? Derby Week is this weekend, I think. You look like an old Southern white woman. Do you know of a tree that's close by his house that we can just be right there? Can I get us to that tree? Okay. That tree. Psew! The gate was open, the side gate. No, the back door, the back door! Got it. I loved sleeping outside, though. Did you guys have like a tree canopy thing? That's good living, Taryon. It's very freeing. I light it up with my flame hands. A penis! Is 'penis' a bad word? Insight check. 24. No. Hang on, wait wait wait. I keep forgetting my insight went up. 26. Wilhand, if you don't mind me asking. I know you mentioned to Pike before about a blood curse. Do you actually believe in the curse or do you believe that it's because of the life the Trickfoots lead? I know you've worked hard to get away from them. Plus she single-handedly helped lead the rebuilding of a Sarenrae temple in Vasselheim. Why do you think Ogden is dastardly? What did he do? Just going off what you said. Wise words. Pike, is there anything you need from here before we leave? Stale blondie. (gasps) What? Not everyone can be a dope adventurer, all right? You're making a blank? Can I do a nature check-- I'm kind of jelly. Why didn't we get lacewood? You have a really big room, Pike. Yeah, not that I'm comparing, I'm just, it's very nice. When you list it out like that, really weird. You drink a lot of wine. It's hard to take you seriously, ever, but even more so now with that ridiculous hat. I feel like we're not one to speak on curses and bad things not existing. That was cranberry juice, Grog, and that was a solid opinion. Um. I could look at his face and his weird tics and deduce very hard. 25. You thought it was truth serum, yeah. Yeah, I was kinda with you there. Okay, hang on. I mean, we're, as Taryon said, awesome. I was being generous. If we just go through with this, is there any harm in that? Hate, greed, pride, any of the seven deadly sins. Man, I feel like we're really getting off the point. Why did you use an SAT word, Matt? Why? Very fit. Ogden at dinner the other night said that each generation is affected by a blood curse, and he believes it's you in this generation? Because you and JB are in the same age, right? So you're the same generation. So maybe Percy's theory isn't quite wrong. I don't know. Or isn't, just in case. Right? But what if it goes out of Pike and into her? Man, so many variables. I mean, maybe Ogden just isn't telling you things because he's so old, it's locked away and he doesn't remember. You know? How long does it last? It's an interview. You don't look like you're reading someone's mind when you're doing it, right? You don't look in her ear-- Don't you have that Divine Intervention-y thing? That Dear Sarenwae-- Sarenrae. Is it four days and on that night? Four nights from tonight. Are there trees nearby? Are there trees nearby? I can get us close. We can also travel via being clouds, like we've done in the past. Or we can just hike and enjoy the scenery. It is a nice hike. The canyons. Yeah. It's rained a lot this winter. So, okay. If it's two and a half days' journey, and we're planning on doing this, then we would have to take Ogden and the gnomes and all things needed for this ritual, right? It means we would at least be framing it like we're committing. I mean, that gives you a long hike to be able to talk and mind-read the gnomes while we walk. It gives you a solid good minute of hiking to read the gnomes. All right. Wait, shades coming from you? You don't look shady. (strained laughter) Wait, I feel like a story was starting! Well, two and a half days, I can teleport us closer, and then we can either hike or cloud the rest of the way. With the gnomes or the tree stride? Or Teleport Via Plants? And there's how many gnomes? Four. Then we'd leave one behind. Okay. It would take a slot out of our ten. Wait, from here to the base of the mountain? With my tree-stride. With the gas. Let's go glamping. But as long as I can sleep afterwards. I do that. We're not leaving tonight, right? Tonight? This is the same night we got back. And the lavender and sulfur? What if what you're seeing, Ogden, and I mean no disrespect in any way, is a possible outcome or future that might not ever happen? And as Percy and Tary, as the science bros have said several times, at least a negative outcome is still an outcome, or something like that. Yeah. We'll learn things for science. You need a pound of it. I was tree-striding us all to the base of the mountain, right? That's what I'm doing? Okay. Double-gas. No, I'm gonna take Tary. I'm making a trip back. I'm gonna take Tary, Pike, the gnomes, Vax, me, how many's left? That's it, right? And Grog will go. Why don't you guys start off on the rug? That is a good idea. That's what I'll do. I'll tree-stride some through. I'll meet you there! (sings) Butterfly in the sky. MARISHA, ASHLEY and Really? I would've told them. Well, time to pitch a tent and make it fabulous. It's hard to see with the blue light. It could be this monitor. I don't know. It takes Pike 24 hours to cast this? So we have to protect her for 24 hours, yeah? I'll go by that spire closest to you. Yeah, little close to the stalagtite. Yeah, thank you. Common, Elven, Celestial-- sorry, Sylvan, Druidic, Primordial. 15. Oh, sorry, eight. Sorry. You just shot at it, you didn't do anything? Including a Hex? Was Percy not in the circle before? That's interesting. And Trinket was. Am I in the circle of what I know-- Pike? Okay, hearing Vex figure this out, I'm gonna step forward just a little bit into the sulfur line, and then I'm gonna cast Moonbeam right overtop of him at fourth level. And see what happens. Moonbeam. So a shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage, and if it fails, it instantly reverts to its original form. If it's a shapechanger. But I don't really know, I'm just guessing. Kinda harnessing the moon, you know? Yeah, moon goddess shit? Yeah. I'll kind of shift towards the front of the column, so I have the column behind my back. Yeah. What was the bead thing? Is it piercing? Wow! Top of its turn? It takes 4d10 of damage. Is it safe to like over my earpiece say like-- Oh. Sorry. What's going on? What? Play it out? Okay, I want to step forward a little bit. Can I make out details of the space? Of the faces that are in it? Can I do a perception check to see if I recognize either Pike's face in there or Ogden's face or any of the gnomes' face? Do I recognize any faces? My whole action? Okay. Great, 17. Okay. And that's my whole action? Okay. That's my action. How many fucking pastries did they take? Come on, Pike! So wait, that's Johann? Or what's-his-name and his wife? Where the fuck is JB? Yeah, right? What's that? What is that? Oh shit! I'm going to go after Johann and Astra. And can I do an Entangle spell around her? I haven't done an Entangle in a second-- give me a second. Beat a 20, bitch! Do it! Do it! Do it! Ranger! Can I take her and Grasping Vine and throw her into my entanglement and just keep all of them entangled? I tighten the grasp on them. And I go, and down. It was more the principle of the matter. I release my spell. Where did Ogden's staff go when it got jettisoned out of him? I'm going to go gather it real quick. I'm going to cast Detect Magic on it. No. I don't have that. I have Dispel Magic. Hey, Tary? Does this look like anything to you? Does this look magical? Can you tell? Here you go, Tary! There it is! I'm like, this motherfucker has more hit points than a fucking dragon. What the shit is going on?
