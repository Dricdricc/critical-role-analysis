Thank you, thank you. Thank you to my mother who birthed me. She should really be the one who's getting thanked. Yes. I'll leave that to Laura in a couple months. Thanks. (laughter) That's fair. Just waiting for the other guys. I need to start planning. Oh man. Good times. I've never seen Foster sprout tears like that. That was amazing. Next charity drive we have you could auction a few. I'm sorry, never mind, it's passed. No, I was thinking you could auction them off for charity next time, next charity drive. Almost a natural 20. Almost a 20! I'll take it. Molly'll take it. Sure, yes. Which way's north, by the way? Okay, thank you. 13 just hits, good to know. 21. Okay, I feel like this has changed the plan that I had. Fjord, I feel like I should get up there. You're the only one there. All right. Just this one time, though. I'm going to throw a throwing star. Natural 20. (cheering) Okay, sorry. That's a better roll. (counting) Ten damage? I don't get another one, right? It's just one action. Okay, and I'm going to move. I hit him! Then that's it, that's my turn. I'm going to stay there. He has potentially three rounds until he dies. You don't have Healing Word or anything anymore? I'm watching people get squashed in front of me. Freaking kill box. That's my thing. Molly. He's looking at Nott pretty hard? Okay, Beau is going to run and flank with Nott over here onto also the northwest side. I have to be on the opposite side. No, I want to go in front of him, where I can get his attention. The northwest side. Yeah. I'm going to point at his dick, and I'm going to go Tiny thing! Then for my action, I'm going to take the dodge action. Huh? Yeah. I say Tiny thing! You tiny thing! To insult his penis size? Okay. Well, it's a natural one. Well, the second one was a one. First one was an eight. Neither were good. So I didn't get his attention? No! I'm sorry. I should have been more explicit about his insulting his penis size. Shit. Huh? Do we win?! Fuck! You did good, Sandman. Me and you take the head, maybe we can-- Yasha and I are going to flank his head. Yeah, we want to both try and get him in the head. That's what I'm saying. We flank his head. Sorry. I used poor language. We're both by his head. Okay. I look at Yasha and I'll go down first. Right after me. Okay, ready? I'm going to aim right for his other eye socket, the other one that Nott hit, and come down right in the middle, try and gore his head out. Please don't fuck up on a sleeping guy. 14 and 15. Okay. Oh god, it's a one. Plus four, so six damage. That sucks. I take my bonus action and Three Stooges style, go poke, right in his eye. That's a natural 18. Okay, let me see if I get that crit. No, 18 though. God, a one again. Five damage. Lot of crappy damage rolls. I thought you said, who's going to attack first, we were going to Goodfellas it. We were going to do that. Can I then move and try and jump over him so I then flank him with Yasha? Can I use my movement to get to the other side? Okay. They did. I liked how the archer was walking around ready, all the time, maybe we should do that. Yeah. Guys, I feel like we got the better end of the deal on this draw. Kind of glad I'm not fighting this thing. We should rip off these guys' aesthetic completely. Yeah, formations are cool. Knock down the shoes. Really, he doesn't catch nuance though, so. Good to know for next time. Is there free booze? All right. Beau. Oh shit. They look familiar. Come on, let's go make asses out of ourselves! Names. Information. Where are they going to fight? Are they going to roll out people? What was that about making promises? Me and Yasha are going to go talk to the wizards. It's okay. Fjord's been teaching me how to talk to people. Sure. I walk up to Orenid Hass. Oremid. I grab Yasha behind on the small of her back. I walk her up to the window, and I'm like Yeah, and there's actually a really great view-- Right? It's such a great view. Over there is the Cobalt Soul. We were. I recognize you, too. I feel like we've met before. Maybe at a gala previously? Beau. Trent Ikithon. Majestic is my middle name. We saw, the other day, you guys fighting off those invaders, that was very impressive. Thank you so much for your service to the city. Well, I mean, it was pretty public. Towers are tall. That doesn't look good. No. She travels and has helped-- Well, you see, you have to go through me, because I'm her booker. That's actually a conversation that me and you and the rest of The Mighty Nein can have. No, I am Cobalt Soul. Yeah. Super proud of the work we're doing over there. Everyone at the Cobalt Soul feels the same about you all at the Halls of Erudition. Thank you. One last question, Oremid. The Cobalt Soul's been talking about moving to the front line. Do you have any idea if we're going to get the same support from the Hall of Erudition? Because I know you're a fan of our work and we're such a mutual fan of yours. Beautiful. Cobalt Soul's got your back too. Rexxentrum. Soltryce Academy. Oh my god, he's got a weakness. Let's remember this for later. Man, Yasha's super honest. Super forthcoming. I don't think so. You definitely made it seem like she could be a Xhorhasian spy definitely there to potentially kill them. In fact, I think that's exactly what they thought might have been happening. Yeah, it was kind of great. I think they're going to look at you as a good resource. I think that's what you revealed yourself as. What the fuck is the Kryn though? Oh, the Kryn. I was envisioning a big, evil monster. Have you seen the dark skies? I think Molly's right. I think Molly and Nott are right. I think they're going to try and start enlisting soldiers here. Are they doing the same where you're from? Where do we go? Yes! I drink all the leftover drinks that people left behind. No, I'm just finishing the ones that are left behind! It is an atrocity to leave alcohol on a table. 17. Probably. You're a-- You-- See, that's even shiftier. We have fucking money to burn! Oh my god, I'm so tired! Pillow Trove! We're at a break! And thank you, Paul, for getting us all ice cream! Yeah. I told you a fucking secret though. I also kind of told Yasha the secret. You and Yasha know the secret. It's not really that much of a secret. Yeah. As long as nothing crazy happens, I'm assuming. I know. I know exactly what you want to do. Yeah, should be all right. What are you looking for, just more spells? Or anything else in particular? Okay. They're not going to let you see the super secretive weird shit in the back. Yeah, there's tons of history, man. They forced history down my throat. Hey, wait though. I know. Real good at it. Why are you afraid of fire? I'm just saying, I just want to know because I'm going to be taking you around books, and your relationship with fire is, you know. No, are you going to set the books on fire? I'll take you in the library if you tell me why you're afraid of fire. One secret traded for another. It's a fair price, I think. Do you know where to find me when you're ready? I'll take you to the library as soon as I get my payment. Drinks? Inside the hotel has drinks. Well, it's a little unbalanced. I have to choose if I'm going to commit to the handle, or if I'm going to commit to the cup. This is not bad. She's an Instagram model! However many can bunk together, I guess. Yeah. Here's four more for me. Bottle service? Jester does that too. Lend an ear. Give advice. Ease your mind. Just saying that's how it sounded before, too. Is there like a-- never mind. Like the public libraries of today. Yes! I want my pencil set! It felt like a festival inside your school. Support 826LA! Thank you to those who did. Ooh! That's what I was going to say! Wow! You made an incredibly excellent point. It is so easy to defraud the mail. It's a lot to send somebody in a birthday card. Jester, why don't you keep that? We just kicked ass and made 200. We'll do it again tomorrow. Sure. The emergency fund. Sure. Yeah. Is it the four ladies in a room? I rolled a 16 plus-- Oh, 19? Man, in context that was weird as fuck! I rolled a 19. I poke my head out. Do I see Fjord? Psst. You're in the most expensive hotel in 100 miles and you're in the hallway. That's real fucking funny. You want to come in our room so you're not in the hall? I have Nott and Jester and Jester has pastries. We could order room service. You want to come in and order room service? Let's do that. We order room service. I kind of like it. I don't know. Like, you hit someone-- SAM and Yeah, that's great. I'm kind of into it! Yeah. You have to unpack in the moment. Yeah. I mean, yeah. How about this we'll tell them to give us the chef's choice. The special. Oh god. Come on, let's go. We're spending enough money on this place. Okay. Can we go order food first? Then we'll go hit Caleb, because it's going to be, like, 45-60 minutes to deliver it. (knocking) Yeah. Oh, I mean-- No, but I'm not in favor of many things. I don't like a lot of things. Kind of have a problem with authority and they're like the epitome of authority. I watched my father sacrifice a lot to try and impress those people. I'm not sure what it was for. Seems like a lot. What? How do you mean? I'm not super invested in the political spectrum, I just don't want any part of it. So no? I think it could be better. No. No. Marisha's telling you, Beau is being genuine. I think-- I have no investment in their success or failure. I think most of them tend to be scumbags who want monetary and influential gain, and I think they treat their poor pretty shitty and they treat their elite pretty great, and I think that's sucky. Yeah, I think they're garbage people, but Molly thinks I'm a garbage person-- Sorry, a trash person. If they're garbage people, I'm their rare cousin, the trash person. Yeah. Yeah, I-- I watched my father sacrifice a lot to get where he was, and I'm not sure if it was fucking worth it. So the Empire doesn't lean favorably in my spectrum. But I also don't care if they really live or die or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Is the secret that valuable? What's young? Teenager? Why didn't you say anything earlier? When we were talking to Trent. You know we were talking to Trent. One of the other students. He made you executioners? Caleb, that's deeply fucked up, you know that, right? Then one day your parents are brought in as traitors. No? You had to do this to graduate, to prove your loyalty. Into hearing their talks against the Empire, is that what it was? Like to run again? You were just talking with Nott about running tomorrow. If I don't let you in? Caleb, I'm good at keeping secrets. You heard us talking to Trent. You know he wants Yasha, and you're the only person who knows the atrocities that this man-- who utterly gave me the creeps, by the way, so I'm feeling a little bit validated in the fact that I read him pretty well-- I'm just saying, you have a responsibility now. Keep this guy from hurting more people. You want to take down Trent. Is that why you're doing all this? You want to take down Trent? Ah. What are you hoping to find? Caleb, you don't, though. No one wants that amount of power and responsibility. Don't worry, I'll take you to the library. There are two options here you can selfishly try and go after this guy for your own vendetta, or you can use your motives to keep others from getting hurt in a very similar way. All right. I know you just make dancing lights-- or at least you can feel like you just make dancing lights-- but those dancing lights make sure I can punch people in the fucking face whenever I can't see shit. A little bit of teamwork goes a long way. Cool, man, cool. Kick me out of the room, I get it. Yep, all right. No, I mean, you just dumped some heavy-ass shit like that and then ask me to leave. No, I get it, it's fine. All right, I'll leave. No. I'll keep your secret. We'll keep all this a secret. I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of, though. We'll figure it out in time. Caleb (clicks). Nott. I have a charcuterie board coming to the girls' room, if anybody wants any. Huh? I just ordered another fruit platter. But long may he reign. Huzzah. 60 Minutes. Where are we going, before our errands? Or after our errands? What's the destination? Oh, the map! Oh, shit! We forgot to check in with him! Yeah. Does anyone know who funds the Victory Pit? Probably. Yeah. Gel pens! You guys go to Dolan's. You want to take a field trip? I go wherever Caleb goes. Okay. That sounds good. You guys, Dolan's; we'll go library. We'll pull Matt. Pull Matt Key. Fuck! Back to Pumat's. I'm assuming we all heard it as we split. Might be our best way out of town, actually. Good idea. Button up. I turn to Nott. How do I look? Do I have any makeup running? Like once a week. All right, good. Let's go. What's that thing you guys do, Mother's Love? What's that situation? Right. You could go with the first half of that plan, but without the second half that involves the stealing? I'm more concerned about bringing in a man and a goblin. Sure. You do know how to adjust in certain circumstances, though, right? You do know how to improv based on the current surroundings, though, right? Yeah, let's go. I do. Spreading that Cobalt love. That's your name. Memberships. He's a magic fan. Little heavy-handed, man. Like, really heavy-handed. I said you were already being too heavy-handed! Hey, Madeer. How's it been? How's it going? Fucking Zeenoth, am I right? No, he's a great friend! Great guy. Great guy, that Zeenoth. Has Dairon left? Cool, cool. Hey, Caleb, not going to conquer the world in a library visit. No, I cannot give you two more hours. I can't. I will gouge my eyes out with a fucking pencil if I give you two more hours. Do you have something in your neverending flask? Dysology? It's The Silmarillion. There's nothing in this. You handed it back, I thought there was going to be something in it. All right, thank you. Thanks, Madeer. You know, you're not going to find any answers in any of those books. What do you mean it's been 17 years, Pumat? What do you mean? 10,000 gold. They want someone really important dead is what it sounds like to me. Oh. Should have done that like a week ago. Good call. Yeah. Is joining the city joining the war? Is that what they made it sound like? The city's a part of the empire. I think we'll make gold wherever we go. Check by the merchants' guild, see our options, and then make the decision from there. All right. This means we're staying together, though? We do make such good roommates. I think we make a good team. I think there's more to be had here. It might run out, who knows. I'm not an optimist, but think there's still more to be had. Merchants' guild then polite exit? Oh that's right, our horsies! LAURA and Does she have any badass weapons? Any badass sticks? Are we checking the merchants' to see if there's any armed escort requests out of the merchants' guild? Mutually. So you want to hire more legionnaires to go kill an ex-legionnaire who wasn't legionnaire-y enough for you. Right. Right now? I rolled a seven plus three. Wait, right? Plus three, yeah. 44. (chanting) Level five, level five. I want to go to Taco Bell on the last 45 minutes of my birthday. 45 minutes.
