Yeah. Just floofy with Kiri in between. Yeah, that's pretty-- I'm glad we're alive. I take my staff and I lay it long ways over the entire bench on the other side. Yeah. We're always so mean to the guests! You were listening in to our conversations? I mean, not for several years for a different reason. Same kind of creepy, though. You're not Grog anymore, it's okay. All right. So you're looking for a bowl. A dangerous bowl. You don't want to get it in the wrong hands because-- Just don't touch them. You're sure you're just a tenth? No. I've had shorter conversations with family members. What's your name? Kelly? Cali. Calianna, that's cool. Beau. You're very excitable. Do you have one little wing back there, too? That would have been cool, though. We're not responsible for any injury or death that you may sustain while traveling with us. Even if it is from a member of The Mighty Nein. Oh shit there's not-- no, we're not ironic any more! Oh, that's true. It's a double entendre. LAURA and Do we have basically zero visibility? Ounterloch. Aww. Damn it! We're the best-looking people in this town, and that's saying something. Say "fire" one more time. Thank you. You are. For 100 gold, I think you will. I'll join you. If you want to like-- Look, I'm trying to wingman you here right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you mean on the exterior? I'm keeping watch up front. What kind of a check is this? Okay. Oh, I thought it was actually higher when I first looked at it. 17. It's me and who? Do you want to make it with advantage or separate? It's not great for me either. Six. Clear on the front! (shouting) Clear on the left? Man, which way am I looking? Don't fuck me, Sunny. Man, that's really frustrating. Seven. Huh? Seven. Not good. I keep getting so close. Sorry. Febron. Yeah. Is this a thing that happens, I'm assuming? There's three. Ooh. It moves. Wow! Anything on the left? No, I'm asking for anything on the left. Thank you. Nine. I roll obnoxiously bad. Oh yeah. The little bamboo ones. Those are great. What did we pay you for? It's questionable. It's honestly debatable. True. Come on Frumpy. A baker's dozen. Cause Fabron doesn't seem to know which way his ass is, so. All right. I think so. Don't fuck me, Gil. Natural 20! Gil! I go Oh, you're about to-- watch it! Oh, I grab him. Can I reach out and grab him? Trying to cover my mouth. Either that or we lose our shithole guide. No. Okay, we lose our 100 gold investment. Athletics, right? Okay. Ooh! Nope, it's worse than I thought. It's real bad. It's an eight. I take my staff and bat him away like a helium balloon. Just start batting him back over away from it. Can I now grab him by the collar and try and drag him away? Come on. Yeah. Watch your step, man! Ah. Ten. No, that's not-- just no one move. Look at you! You're smexy. All right, I'm going to stealthily do some monk (footsteps) up to it a bit. See if I can get a better look. Oh my god, 14. Is it a troll? Does he see The Mighty Nein? But he doesn't see me. How far away am I from him? Could I theoretically throw something behind him? Yeah, sure. I'm going to take out a handful of ball bearings and try and toss them. 24-- 22. I'm going to stealth back. 19. It's a troll. Like a-- No. He's like a troll. I think he knows we're here. But he's a slimy undead troll-like guy. I also think he might be who lives in that hut. Because he looked bony. I don't think we want to deal with them, though. I think he's stalking us. It might be better if we move quicker through here as well, instead of stealthily. How long have you lived here? We wanted to move faster. Thank you. You're so complimentary. It makes me a little nauseous. Man, that's so sweet. Ugh. Where are you from? Really? You're an ex-cultist. They worshiped you? We're on rough terrain right now? But where he is, it would be considered rough terrain? We can try to send someone ahead as bait, lure him out, fight him on steady ground? He had green pus-y ooze pouring out of holes in his face. Just want to throw that out there. I got undead vibes from this guy? He definitely had like a collarbone just hanging out. That's what I literally just said. He probably is hearing everything we're talking about. She's so formal in her admonishment. Man, it kind of makes me feel bad. Anyway, let's go. I'll flank to the north. I'm going to stealth to the north. He's moving away from us? Okay, we do not want to follow this bunny rabbit down the hole. Yeah, continue on. Motherfucker, my perception is balls. Nine. How long does it take you to talk to dead people? I'm going to keep a lookout while she does this. Yasha and her gag reflex. Swamp fishman from underground. So when you cut it, it bleeds. Got it. Almost made a bet if Febron was going to make it. Yeah. Oh no, man, oh no. He did his job, though. He got us here. Hold this for us. Look, he tucked Febron under his arm. That's a natural one. Actually, I'm going to blow my d8. Ooh, that's an eight. 14. Green stuff should sponsor us. That was Molly? I think I'm 40 feet within him. If you do it-- Hey, so deep! Okay, I'm going to pop pop. My two strikes-- oh, wait, that's a die damage. First two strikes! First one is a 21, second one is a 16? Okay! Damn it, I rolled a one, this sucks. 12 damage for the first one, seven damage for the second one. Yeah? I'm going to use a ki point to do stunning strike. Stunning strike! Fuck. That's good to know. I still have my bonus. I'll just punch him in the face. Because we might still fight all those things. Nine damage. No, sorry, ten damage. That was it. You guys, it makes your throat a little numb! Guys, our money's getting away! I'm okay! I turn around to you and I go (gasping and groaning). Hang on, let me make sure I'm doing my math right, too. It was 33 points of damage is what you did before, right? Okay, and then-- I am unconscious. Anyone have a Hold Monster situation? You know! Haven't even gotten her backstory yet. We need like a hold thing-- I do. Man, I was hoping to stun it, guys, I'm sorry. I'm sweating. Sorry, audience. You guys know where he's taking me. Roll a 20. I was just thinking that as well! TALIESIN and I died when I heard that. Kiri be my savior! Yeah, Kiri. Oh! I'm conscious! Seven hit points, right? I'm going to wake up, see my situation and go (gasps) and play dead. Come on, Cali! Calianna! I have blackmail material on you, motherfucker. Okay. I am levitating. Yeah, can I scootch and perch up on the branch? I grip the tree branch with my thighs, I'm going to force grip it. Yeah, side saddle and then I'm going to-- I don't know why I'm acting like I'm drawing a bow like I'm a bow user because I've never been a bow user, but my name is Beau. I'm going to take two shurikens and do that. First attack, don't fuck me Gil, 15. Okay. Oh wow, that's 14. Bummer, second one, natural 20. 14. Which is a d4 we've said, correct? Sure, I'll take that. That's a ten. Yeah, damage. Four plus six, my attack bonus, right? My damage bonus. Oh I'm sorry, eight. I have a bonus, right? But I can't do a range. I don't have a healing potion. Kill it! He's got our gold! How far away is he right now? I couldn't jump one more and try to get him a little-- Oh, he's healing? No. Yeah, I'm doggy-paddling through the air. I slow fall. If these are the warnings. My body hurts. Hey, Twitch viewer! Didn't see you there. We here at Geek & Sundry appreciate your viewership and your subscription. But did you know that if you have an Amazon Prime account, you can get a free subscription to a single Twitch channel of your choice? In fact, you might even have an Amazon Prime account and not even know it. It's a proven fact that five out of five Amazon Prime account users have Amazon Prime because they simply forgot to cancel their 30-day free trial. So put that free two-day shipping to use and subscribe to Geek & Sundry. But remember, you have to re-subscribe each month to your Twitch channel of choice, which is kind of irritating. But, you know, it's ultimately not our design. So give Geek & Sundry a sub because, you know, we did shoot this fake PSA. [break] Oh, now you got it on Mark! I trusted you, motherfucker. Two past noon. Four men required. Why do you feel the need to call me a good friend? Yeah. Maybe like, two past noon? Are you trying to look for all six of them? Maybe they want the safe house for themselves? Do I see anything like landmarks or anything out of place surrounding the tree? It's all right. 14. It's just one little ribbon? I'm going to see if I can climb the tree and get to it. Sometimes we call her Nott Bren. Yeah. What was that thing you said about honesty earlier? I can't remember. I'm talking about before you almost killed me when you had that great quote about honesty earlier. Eight. Can I have Fjord give me a boost? Nothing else has happened? I almost died today, motherfuckers, I almost died. That was Caleb's fault, exactly, and I can't remember the thing he said about honesty and remembering. Does it feel like it's bigger on the inside? Yeah, do the tracks lead to the hole? Tuna? Salmon? Before we go down or as these guys go down, can I take a lap and look at the bodies on the outside and see if I recognize any of them? The six bodies. That's cool. Okay. So they all seem like smugglers? Can I do a quick round of their pockets? Okay. Just real quick! 13. I'll take that. Sorry. Oh god. Nott Bren, yeah. Oh, what is that, what are they riding? They're riding like watery penises. Not within like 50 feet. Are you going to land on your feet for the cat? I can go down first and make sure it's secure on the other end. Yeah, I help anyone else down. Okay, we're going to go. We're doing this. I mean. If your bowls are magical, though, they should survive, right? Yeah, let's ambush. (quiet yell) Yeah. Give the explosive things-- Yeah, dry up the water! Yeah! I was going to say, you sound like them, I love it! You know how under pressure, you can discover hidden talent? Maybe if you do this, you'll be like Oh, I never knew this fishman side of me! 18. I'm-- wait, 25 to 20? No. 19. Can I hold my turn until Fjord goes? Can I move into place and then hold my action until Fjord goes? I want to attack after he attacks, after he casts a spell. Can I move in this corner as far as I can-- Yeah, I'm going to stealth-- yeah. Stealthing as fuck. I'm going to hold my shurikens. No, it's me. I get to go first. Can I pop around the corner? I have my goggles on, by the by. --but I still can't see? Okay, I'm going to pop out. Can I pop out? Am I able to do that? Okay, I will throw two. First one? Man. I'll take that 12, though, for an 18 to hit? And that's-- sorry. Seven damage on that one. And then second one... ooh, those are double fours, which I don't believe hit. And then I'm going to take a ki point and cast-- I almost called it Uncanny Dodge. Okay. I would have had to have said it earlier, which I didn't know. Do it! Don't get dragged! You have to roll under the spell damage. Tentacle range? Oh boy. Oh you? Huh? I'm so swole! Madonna, Ray of Light? Circa 2002? Jesus! Oh wait, after Jester? Oh, I'm sorry. So me. Can I get to the doucher? (deep voice) Sorry, my voice is even deeper now! Sorry. 'Sup, Nott Bran? First attack. Okay. 16? Second attack. Not good. 11? Okay. First attack. All right, ten damage. Oh, is it dead?! You good? Okay. Good. Could I take the staff, and I pick it up with the fish still on it, and I'm like It's fish kebabs! It is today. That's what's on the menu. Too many one-liners! Can I do something creative and take my staff with my fish on it, and fling it, and try and throw the fish cadaver at the other fish dudes? Oh come on, man. I can't try to aim to attack-- But I have a bonus action! You said I could use flavor for unarmed shit. He told me to be flavorful! So can I take my actual bonus action to do Patient Defense? Did I have any more movement, by the by? Could I have scooched up a bit? Just a scooch. Excuse me! I've got very long legs right now. It tried to run. It did want to come home. Upon seeing Fjord get super daze-y, can I use my Sentinel feat to crack this guy who just tried to attack? Oh! That was awesome. Doubling the dice, that's eight plus four, which is 12, plus another dice, that's two. That's right. That's two plus another four. Sorry, that's two doubled which is four, so that's 16 damage. As he grabs the chain, big Beau steps on the chain and cracks him right in the face. What happens on Monday nights? Fuck! But that's all of their turns, right? Except for that motherfucker. Is it like a life vest? Yeah? Yeah. And then big me over top of her. Hi, Fjord! Good to see you alive. I don't know what you just did, but I am so into it. Okay, I'm going to stride forward (large footsteps). Ah, fuck! This is what Travis deals with all the time. Ow! Through Cali's acid mist, I'm going to split the air and cut down and do a big slap right on its face. I get a little bit of-- It probably gets stuck a little bit, but then it gives me a nice little snap. Okay, I'll take that. That's enough. 19. 20. 19. I don't know. It's enough. Okay, that's nine plus-- Ooh, 13. The second one, knowing I'm going to get stuck on the ceiling, I'm going to paddle back and come up and crack with the other end. Damn it! Okay. 15? Plus seven plus-- ten total. I'm going to do flurry of blows. Flurry of Beaus. That's not great. 12. Second one is even fucking worse. It's a two. Can I assist for advantage? I'm going to take my staff and try the same thing. Is she all right? Hey, Cali. Oh, it does magnet. It does actually magnet. People are going to suspect things of us. Trading in manacles all the time. These didn't work! You have luck? Oh, it was the-- You're so mean. So, Cali. I started a conversation earlier. Which might be why you got so distracted. You seem to have such an affinity for cute things. Is there a reason why you like cute things? I'm not saying that not all of us like cute things. We all love cute things, but you seem to really like cute things. I just might appreciate some other things. Man, thank you. Maybe it's in the next room. There's still another room. It's true. Could be a whole network of caverns. Until we find-- We do have boom boom sticks. Or like you said, we just destroy the entrance to where they can't come through. It takes time, and equipment. I could probably join you for a swim. If you want to just swim and back. You're going to swim and come back? "As if I didn't know that coming here." That's the worst thing anyone has said about us. Our job was to secure the safehouse. We can collapse this and say job done. That changes things. Maybe run a line. Have the rope in case. What? Caleb's still holding the bowl? Can I snatch it out of his hand real quick? Just a straight dex check? It's not great. Ten. I'm playing a game of keep-away. (sing-songy) Caleb. Caleb, I respect you and all of your intentions, but your caution does not get to control other people's destinies. You had no intentions of wanting this bowl, or needing this bowl, or caring about this bowl until Cali came around. I grab Caleb, drag him aside, hand Cali the bowl, drag Caleb over to a private corner, and I say, look. We all have our fucking trauma. You understand that? We all have our fucking garbage, and our dirt, and our shit. But you don't get to use your skeletons in your closet, your PTSD, to be shitty and control other people and what they want. It does not make you the authority on what's right and what's wrong. Just because you think that you're a shitty person, guess what? We're all fucking shitty people. I get feeling like shitty people. I don't speak for the rest of these guys, but I get feeling shitty. But it doesn't mean that you get to impress that on other people and make them feel like shitheads just because you are. Then she fucking lied to us. We take that, and we learn that as a lesson for later on. Yes, Cali? I'm not blaming him. It's just that this isn't the first occurrence of something like this with him, either. I think he is, too. It's kind of what Molly said. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. That's fair. Troll, and also really big alligators. I love you. Tell them where to find you on High Rollers! Yogscast is great, you guys are great, the cast is great-- Yeah, Cali!
