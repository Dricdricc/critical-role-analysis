Finally? Although you are Taliesin Jaffe. Only if the writers' room dropped the ball. Yep, Apple and Google Play. Oh yeah, we have some announcements. (perfect unison) Shit's getting real. (gasps) You can get them. They're on ThinkGeek I think. What a douche. Scanlan, you should remember that line, that's a good one. Yeah. Yeah, the Prime Trammel. Which we now have to get-- And the Cliffkeep is not too far from Whitestone? Do I recognize the city that I can get us to that's close? My home. Sorry. Sorry, Terrah is the Earth Ashari. Should we go to Terrah? Check in with them, I guess, while we're there? And talk to Pa'tice. All right. We ready to go? I will burn my 8th-level spell slot to Plane Shift us to Terrah. Mind the gap. Don't worry about it. Yeah, I should probably-- We need to collect more, though, right? We have to get like eight or something. Oh no, wait, Ioun was healing for eight centuries. That's where I got that number. Sorry. Oh yeah! Let's walk through that asshole. That sounds worse for us. But fuck it. What were the shard things called again? The things we need to collect? So we need pieces of god. Oh, to Terrah? Do we want to stay the night here, then? I can't mist us right now. I'm tapped out. Camp here. Yeah, let's go. They have a spare room for us. I'm the leader of the Air Ashari and the Voice of the Tempest. No, there's four of us, and I'm one of the four. I do. No, we can just go, like I was saying five minutes ago. Let's just go. I request Pa'tice. Kaitiaki. Pa'tice, I am so sorry for the late intrusion. We've just gotten back from the plane of Elysium, so we're a little tired. Yeah, we're fighting a god right now, well, more of like a demi-god, so have you heard of Vecna? Sorry, I'm probably getting ahead of myself. Do you have any food? Let's talk over dinner. We always try to source locally. So the world's in danger, as she said-- Aw shit! I just induced panic. (sighs) Okay. More than anything, I think I would want you all to be relief for the surrounding area and surrounding villages if anything disastrous were to happen. I know you have to guard the rift and that is insanely important and especially right now with someone like Vecna who could potentially abuse that. But if anything were to happen, I don't know if you could house extra people during a disaster. Yeah, that's more, I think, what we would need. Currently, Vecna is just north of Vasselheim, close to Pyrah. They've also been put on alert, but we have not personally been there yet since this has happened. Yeah. Thank you. Do you know if people still try to live there? We're looking for someone. Okay. Maybe. I saw that. (laughter) So the question is, is there actually someone of some minor intelligence living there that is this magical key, or did that person get eaten by a giant? I'm not saying it's bad information, I'm just wondering who the key is. Yeah. Maybe they're still living inside. Maybe it's like a Moby Dick situation. Can we theoretically just mist over everywhere? It is a little weird to be making promises, though. Keyleth opens the shamble door first with a little earth movement. I'm dressed. Yeah. I'm not like that. I'm going to go get coffee. I guess. Are we wind walking there? (mispronouncing) Wind walk? Wind walking. Yes. No, man. We have been through this with our entire group so many times. Thank you. What do you need? We can leave it in the hands of the Ashari, see if they can find somebody. Yeah. They're all right. TALIESIN and Towards the Falafel Pools! We have it on the map! I quickly do the math of how fast I can travel and be like okay, it shouldn't take long. This is a vacation spot. What's that water park nearby? I'll go. I follow. I think we've failed at manners often. I'll be comfortably back, as well. Yes, that's exactly why. Bear traps are the biggest thing you can get for a giant. Trapped? Is this going to be an Uncharted kind of adventure? You did say kinky, right? What's your name, friend? That oddly made way too much sense. I sometimes live in a yurt. They're quite nice. No, I know what he means. Who were your companions? Oh no. Oh no, Grog. What's your relationship to her? Good question. You're a champion of Ioun. Of course he's a champion of Ioun. What? Why do people like calling you elf boy and elf girl? Wait. Yes, I'm a little freaked out right now. You're my worst fear incarnate. Sorry, that seemed very rude. My worst nightmare incarnate. I've seen you in my dreams. Somehow everything you have said since the minute we've walked into this building has made 100% sense, and I think that's what scares me the most, is I understand everything you've said. We can grant you power in items, but I don't want to speak for all of us, but I think all of us can speak a little bit to the fact that items don't grant you as much inner power as you expect them to. Unless they're very highly argued and debated-upon boots, in which case I still think the argument-- Of course he believes. Believing is not the question. That's something that's tangible. Ioun is distant. What if we have found her? What if Sprigg is right? What if all of the information that Ioun knows is here in Sprigg? How? We don't have the eye! What a cock! It's always been the troll dick. Do I have time for a reaction? 24? (yelling) No, Sprigg! Don't. Fuck. Me. Gil. It's fine. Gil did all right. 12. I don't know why I did deuces. 12. 12 initiative, Wu Tang out. Cowards. Yay, Manners! We're bad at manners, until now! She's after me. What? Where? Who? There were more of them! He's going for Sprigg! But because Scanlan's over Sprigg! Come on, Sprigg! The pen is mightier than the bookcase security! Okay. In my weird, emotional panic, Keyleth is going to turn and look around and she sees Vex firing a bow and Sprigg down on the floor, and she's upset, and she's just going to scream at the top of her lungs and do a Fire Storm around the building. Just (screams) and then I'm going to go (boof) where I think people might be in my rage. Around the building. Sorry, Vax. I don't really know you're there, but around here and around here, and I'm sure I see Vex shooting at things, right? I'm going to try and go around. Here, around, and that way. No. He's getting hit. I just know there were people shooting through this window and through this window, so I'm doing a perimeter around. Ten ten-by-tens. 21. I need two more d10s. I reroll ones. None of these are ones, unfortunately. (counting) 39 fire damage. 39, and they're on fire. So that was my action. I'm going to do that out of my staff as I slam it down. I'm going to look at Sprigg and say gods damn it, Sprigg! And I'm going to use that as my Healing Word, and I'm going to cast Healing Word at second level. Which is 2d4. 11 points to you. And then I'm going to use my free action that I have to turn into a fire elemental. Changing into something's not a bonus, it's a free action to change into my beast shape. Circle of the Moon, bitch! No! Combat wild shape. All right, so I'm just Keyleth. Wait, hang on. No, I'm doing the perimeter. I did think about this, which is why I didn't attack the guy in the house. Right there. Keyleth has anger issues. It's fine. So I didn't destroy your house first. The censer? I do have the herbs. #thanksKeyleth. Yeah, I've earned it. Come on! Yeah, that hits. Yeah. You said 30 points, right? So I'm at 83 points. There's room over here. You get a grit point back, right? We're real sorry about your house. Nine. Ugh, debris, ugh! (repeating) Action, action-- That's such a good spell. (stuttering) Oh jeez. Fire Storm. Yeah, no. d10. I know. That's my one goal in life. I'm a big old homewrecker. Is it in a fireproof safe? No? Okay! All right. So I have this big asshole in front of me, yeah? The house is catching on fire, right? Yeah. Nope, she'd still be really upset and really angry. So continuing what I was saying before, she's gonna rage a little bit more and go into her fire elemental self. Unable to contain her frustration-- Even more upset. I'm gonna move right in the space of this guy. I mean, I'm magical. I sparkle fire. I'm going to go into this guy's space, engulf in flames, and do my multi-attack, two slam touch attacks. That's cocked. Ooh, that's good, that's good. 21. And 16. Fucking balls. Okay. No, plus six to 11. That's 17. So both of those hit. 2d6 plus three. First one is eight. Plus ten. 18 fire damage. That's all I've got, I think. That's it. What do you mean, it's not a big deal? That's the part that I'm confused about! Does that mean that Keyleth would have seen the beholder beforehand? You know what, don't worry about it. Man, so much blind rage. Keyleth takes a few steps back and motions as a fire elemental... I drop my fire form, turn, see my anger, destruction, get immediately guilty, and then do a Tidal Wave to quell the flames. They have multiple eyes. He had another eye, right? Ah! Ow! (laughter) Keyleth is definitely staring, but pretending not to stare. What? Is it really? It is him. I've known it from the minute that I laid eyes upon him. It's him. No, I mean I had a hunch, I had a feeling, deep down inside. I can't say it. If I say it out loud and then if it's not true then I'm an asshole. Percy. Continue holding his hands. I pull out the Tome of Quick Movement. Hold. Hold while I find the paper. Hold. (shushes) Where is it? I have a lot of things. I pull out the fork we that we got to get to Elysium. Is it similar? Oh no. No, it is good. It's good, it's just... Oh, Sprigg. No, it's fine. It's good. I don't know. Everything in my life seems to have this impermanence factor about it. So I hope he's not something that can be used and discarded. Sprigg. I'm sure it's fine, I just-- Oh, Sprigg. I guess I have to start getting used to losing things. I've already built my own prison. They don't know. I'm already there. And I grab his hand, and with that, I cast Plane Shift to wherever he is leading to go. I immediately turn and look to see if Sprigg is still holding my hand. Okay. Glad you're with us, Sprigg. Yes, it is. Okay. I will. Oh god, they're souls. Distracted by Percy, Keyleth just scans. Does anything in Primordial stick out? That's good. 29. I hold my hand over and pull. I put it back and get frustrated. Hey, Sprigg. Stand over there! Damn. Sprigg, stand over there! Yeah, Keyleth was quietly sobbing in Vax's arms and then heard (wedding march) and went (angry roar). Worst double date sangria partners ever. Me and him? We already know. It's fine. You fucking liars. You fucking liars! Just tell us! We know! Yeah. (sarcastically) Oh, surprise! Yeah, it's amazing. And Keyleth lights up her flame hands as she walks off in a fury. No, it only gets filed away in some library where no one else can experience it except for, what, one, maybe two people ever.
