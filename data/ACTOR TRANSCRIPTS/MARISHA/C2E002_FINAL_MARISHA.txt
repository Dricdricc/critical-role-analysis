I did! It was a little complacent, but I yay'ed. I gave him one. We were talking to one of the heads at 826LA over the break, Joel, and he was saying that they would love to do D&D, but no one on their staff knows how to DM or do D&D. So if there's an 826 in your area, and you're like, "I know, I'll start a D&D club," I'm sure they'll be open to it, just go talk to them and go teach kids D&D! Or cool eight-year-olds who are equally as amazing. Nerd is chic now. I'll take that as a compliment. Why don't you just question us right now? I'm confused on why you don't just do that now. Jails are not my favored terrain. Just want to point that out. Not this go-around. No. Not really comfortable with that. Can I double back into the performance area and see if I can find that little girl that they're looking for? Before they do? Yeah. I'm going to try to be aloof, stealth a little bit. I don't want to make myself completely known. No, just trying not to draw attention. I ditched you. That's cocked. That's better. 17. Do I see the little girl whose name was-- what was her name? Are people being amicable? Okay. I want to look around. Do I see any type of movement in the shadows, anyone looking suspicious? Ooh yeah! Natural 18. 21. So they're bringing the both of them out? Am I still next to that horse? I'm going to take my staff and give a really nice whack to the horse to get it to run. Oh my god, I'm so nervous right now. That's not great. 11? Get pissed, sure, kick me. I'm going to bolt in the opposite direction and try and loop around to the south side of the tent. Big dice, big dice. Okay, 19! Okay, can I loop around, kind of come up behind them? The devil toad and Toya. Yep. (yells) Did you see that?! It leaned to a four. Ten. That sucked. Laura, put him in the dice jail. "Okay. It's okay. Toya?" And I look at Toya. "Hey, come on, let's get out of here, let's go." Fuck. You didn't say there were fucking guards. I thought you said they left. One of them left. So wait. Oh shit. Ey! I was actually just looking for the loo? No! I'm trying to get the girl. I was trying to free the damn girl. It's just the two guards, right? So are they taking me away? What are they doing with Toya? Anything? Are they leaving them behind? Okay. I'm going to do a quick-- I'm in shackles? Okay. I'm going to do some monk shit here. I'm going to elbow one of the guards. Right in the ribs. And take the other one and bash the other one in the face and then I'm going to turn to Toya and I'm going to say, "Run! Run! Go! Run!" Trying to distract these fucking assholes. That is a six. Ten. Do I at least get the "Run!" out to Toya? Is she just standing there? Waiting for a guard? What is she doing? Is she running? No, they can both run. Run for your life! Fine, whatever. She wants to get arrested at this point. I go join my friends. Help. Help. Help help help. Help help. Help help help. (laughter) (clears throat) Help. Ah, oh, no you misunderstood. See that was just, I have this spasm that has this twitch. It was an injury from, like, a childhood thing. Yeah that's actually-- (fake crying) it was very sensitive for me. I had a really tough childhood. I was just trying to find a bathroom. Yeah, I'm looking injured, man. I show him my eight hit points of damage. Yeah, this is just a wrong time, wrong place thing. I practically raised her. It's a sensitive subject. Adopted sister. Sure. And I'm more than willing to be compliant with the investigation. In fact, you can see the injury the beast left on my ribs, so if you want to test it for any type of specimen samples, feel free. It's very painful, but I'm willing to do it for the cause. No. It's a separate issue. There was two things going on. There was, like, the big angry toad beast and he got a swipe at me. And then there were people who were getting attacked. Yeah! Yeah. Uh-huh. Nope. Aw, shit. My little sister? What the what? I was just trying to go with what you said. All right. I mean, it kind of worked. But you're not entirely wrong! I was trying to go get the stupid little girl, who seemed to be stupid. I tried to save her. I was like, get the hint, what's going on? (stammers) Yeah, if anything, we should be looking at this guy. Why are we putting our neck out for you? Can I insight check him? Her. Sam. Natural 20. Front butt?! You just saw that, too?! (laughter) Just curious why you have a mask. Yeah! Bringing it back. My mother always said nothing in life is free. None of this absolves the dodgy goblin who slinked past that first question. Where are you from? What are you traveling from? Why the mask? Sure you are. It has nothing to do with that. People who move from place to place frequently tend to have other stories as to why they're doing it. Well, you're going back to the goblin thing. I'm more curious about the travel thing. I immediately check my pockets after that to see is Nott has lifted anything. Is everything still there, all my coin? Not great. Not great at all. Six. Wait that was a 15! Right? That was the dice I rolled? 16. Okay. Wait, I'm sorry. I think I need clarification. If sticks mean things like valuable canes, what do rocks mean to you? Is it the joy of taking the things or do you just like gifts? Do I notice anything shifty about that, while we were looking at his hands? 21. You have questions for me? Yeah, I am. My parents were in the winery business. The wine making business. And halflings really like wine. That's true. Some halflings just deal in wine a lot, and a lot did in the town that I'm from and then my parents wanted me to keep up with the books and all that stuff so it forced me to learn halfling. I was around it a lot. It's a bit aways. It's Kamordah. It's a small farming town, it's no big deal. It's whatever. Nope, just a wandering traveler just like the rest of y'all. Yeah, circus! Woo, circus coming to town! Just don't break anything. Aw buddy. I've seen you have a few tricks up your sleeve. You seem like you're not totally magic inept. Have you had your abilities your whole life, like a kid? Something happen? We got a good 24-48 hours on the rest of you. Nope. Can I request a display? I think I have a broken rib. It might be getting more purple. I'll sleep it off, it's fine. Does it hurt? Don't poke at me with a fork! No, you don't! My bruise is in the shape of a dick? That would be fun! All right. I'll sleep it off. I'm in Jester's room, still, I think. Sleeping on the floor on my bedroll. You hit a button! He just throws the iPad. As I wake up, I sit up and I go Jester? Were you laughing to yourself last night? I just kept hearing giggling. It was obnoxious. Uh-huh. I just get ready. Yeah. I take my robes and I flip them inside out and I take some dirt and dirty it up a little bit and take my hair down and I steal a scarf off of Jester's stuff and I do a bandana around my head. What are you guys doing? You guys leaving? Are you guys fucking leaving? You're not leaving without me are you? You're skipping town. I could skip town with you, though. Do you want to skip town? I guess I go down and have breakfast as well. Would you do my makeup for me? Are you? Let's do that. I mean, look at him. No offense or anything. And you're so concerned with your goblin friend. I mean he's in the same boat as the tieflings. I said your goblin friend. LAURA and Whatever. I'm working on it. Oh, yeah! Yeah. LAURA. Yeah, and a mustache. And a hat. (low, gravelly voice) I think I can do that. I'm going to go a step further and tape down my boobs, bandage them down all the way, you know wrap them. Stuff my crotch a little bit. Do I have some five o'clock shadow? Mr. Woolly? Wait Fjord how do you sound? Say words, you're manly. TRAVIS and Is that your human face? It's so hard. So anxiety-inducing. Are we going out in pairs? Like you said? (Deeper) Are we going out in pairs? Yeah. 16. It's fine, don't worry about it. I mean, you mentioned no sick people. If he was sick, sometimes that word gets around. He was helping. I punched a snake to death. Oh, it was a giant water snake, then the little girls were complaining about more and more instances of these snakes coming out of the lake. Yeah. The Lochward, is that what we're talking about? Sure. You know, we should drink to old stories of Brinjay. Brinjay. Is there anyone who did? That wasn't hypothetical. What's the book? A romance novel. Shithead. We learned a few things, actually. He's a prime target. Perfect victim, perfect candidate. No one really paid attention to him, he was old, he had no family, his son's gone. Awfully convenient. Still awfully convenient that your little circus doesn't allow the elderly, which you never fully explained, and he happened to be one of the oldest people in that circus. Where did that rule come from? The sick makes sense, I asked you that before, but why elderly? Do you know who implemented that rule? Still a good candidate. Or if you were trying to frame someone. Seems to be a lot of pretty bigoted people in this town who don't like tieflings and other strange lots. Jester, you actually said one of the smartest things of the night, which is-- you did, yeah. Which is, guard's really weird. Yeah. The Crownsguards. As you were saying, the Ustaloch? They seem to be the one connecting through-line. Also, what's her name, Norda? Mentioned that she didn't want to let you lot in, but made an exception. I don't know, if I wanted to do something, and if I already knew a bunch of people were upset and angry at a circus and strange people coming in, it's easy framing, in my opinion. That, or if you're up to no good and you don't want to get caught, blame it on the easy frame. The weirdos who just rolled into town. I don't know, it might not be the guards. There might be another through-line that we're missing. Ooh, that's a good idea, yeah! Maybe when they question us-- I like that. Aw. So the Ustaloch is the docks? It's what they called the ward, or it's the lake? What does "usta" mean? What does "usta" come from? You speak Zemnian. East Lake. All right. Agreed. I love how we just went through every rain song in about 30 seconds. Oh shit. Hey, Jester. Do you happen to remember the name of that guy whose daughter we saved from the snake? Yeah. Yeah, because I didn't write it down. Damn it. That's true. We could go by. He seems to like us. That's the snake I punched. Well, no. They helped me. I'm not an egomaniac. They fucking helped me. Give credit to the whole damn group, move on. Thanks for the damn compliment. Sorry for dropping in. Yeah, it's me. I pull the hat off and pull my hair up. It's Beauregard. We killed your snake? Oh no. Don't worry about it. What was your name, friend? Rinaldo! That's what it was. I knew it was an R! Okay, Rinaldo. You mentioned the circus coming to town as weird. Why? How's your little girl doing? Sorry, I cover my beard. Sorry. I have a fang too, right? I'm starting to think that following Enon's story isn't necessarily going to lead us here. He seems like a random victim. Are we just going from person to person in town telling them to come find us? Yeah, maybe we should get back. So, kids don't know anything about this, old people don't know anything about this-- But pure of heart! Still going back to the guards thing! Back to the tavern, let's go. Yeah, how much time does she have? Maybe super stealthily back? Yeah, that's a good idea. Fjord's distracting. He's on Caleb's back! Yeah, he updates overnight as long as he's plugged in, right? Type in your passcode if you agree to the terms. Did you say that because you wanted to tell me something? I like that. We're giving them-- authority. Got the upper hand. Okay. Do we invite them in or are we going to--? You open the door. I'm going to sit, unassuming, on the bed. Oh! Oh, yeah, hi. Bullshit! Jury duty shit! Goddamn it! Seven dollars a day? What is this shit? You guys should start a band. Like a boy band or something. I thought you enjoyed games. Sure. Okay. That's not true! I still say that some of the best information that you can get can be in the information that you don't find. I'm just saying! Sometimes the lack of information can be a process of elimination. It's super broad! I'm trying to be fucking silver lining, so I don't feel like a piece of shit for waste a day, and you guys are shitting on that, but it's fine. See? No one knew anything about him. That means, prime candidate, someone's little experiment. Little Frankenstein. I'm telling you. Who are you talking to? About 24 hours longer than you have. Ooh, that's a good idea. You guys notice that it's weird that no one's actually really talking about this? This is a small town. I come from a small town. Small town people gossip. Someone is talking about this, we just haven't found them yet. 200AM field trip! Mm-hmm, I like that. Oh, is he like an asshole cat? Yeah, we did. Natural Remedies. What was the other one? Jackalwere? That's true. How do people send messages in this town? Have we figured that out? Before we leave-- is there a window in the hall? Or are there only windows in our bedrooms? Okay, that's fine. On our side of the room-- On our side of the door, I'm going to take out my healer's kit. Do I have any bandages or medical tape or anything like that? I'm going to tie a bandage ever so lightly around one side of the handle onto something on to the other side of the door. If there's something like a lamp or some kind of pipe or something I can tie it to. Correct. Okay, yeah. I'll take some string and just some twine and-- Yeah. Well, I figured we're all in the same room at this point. I'm trying to make sure that if someone tries to come in our room we'll know if they come in. What can you do? That's better! Let's do that. Well, I was going to say in the door, but if there's maybe a place in the hall. 19. Let's not spread out too far, though. Perception? 18. To the left. Three in the morning? I turn to Caleb. Any tingling from your alarm system? That's a good point. Is she under arrest? We don't know. Maybe we should go back to the circus. Scene of the crime? That whole thing? I'm all right. Or if you see something. How far are we from the inn? A little tagger. Is no one staying behind or--? Oh not great. Nine! Are we in like an alleyway, or in the street? All of us? Oh man. It's real cold out. You fixed them a bit! Yay. What is that? Do you guys have like a nightlight? Oh sure. Do they still look like crownsguard? Okay, yeah. Something good, something good? That's dope. I'm sure Rob Liefeld just got a nosebleed and he doesn't know why. Not that one. I don't feel good about it. Oh not bad! 21. The cart? And it's by the lake, right? That's pretty close to a lake. It's the lake, it's common? I had Mona and Lena, but maybe it's Lolie. Was there anyone new here recently that you haven't worked with a lot? What about Mona and Yuli? Why are they bitter? (stutters) What happened to them? No, I'm trying to hear and whisper at the same time. Matt Cone of Whisper! What did they say? Why do they think that? Why is the world shitty? Yeah. Listen. The world has its own brand of shitty depending on whose eyes are looking at it, right? So what is their brand of shitty? Where are they? Molly, why did you laugh when I asked about the sisters? First cast! TRAVIS and 13. Not great. Right, okay. Can I insight check the sisters? What are they doing right now? They're not saying anything, though? Do they look nervous or are they just being shifty? Yeah. 15. Toad guy. I would like to talk with the sisters while that is going on. I go and sit down next to them, putting my knees up, too. This whole thing is really messed up, right? Yeah. Man. Like, why would we do anything like that? I feel like we're all being needlessly persecuted. Oh, sorry. I'm Beau. The other Bo, but I helped fight the zombies the other night. I'm under house arrest. We're under the same situation, just separately. Not really. I don't want to compare myself to you, because that would be rude. He's such a dick. Why is he such a dick? Oh, sorry, he's been talking shit about you this whole time, I don't know, I just-- It's okay. 15. What am I trying to do? I'm trying to figure out who's behind all this so that we can keep moving on with our lives. Your guys' performance was amazing, by the way. I loved it. No! So wait, it's probably Gustav? What makes you say that? Oh. Wow. You have interesting perspectives. Hey, weird question, how do you guys come up with your acts? Is that something that you guys create yourselves, or do you guys workshop it? You feel the same way, Knot sisters? Feel like this is karma on Gustav? Shut up! Shut up! Insight check on the Knot sisters! What?! Natural 20! [all exclaiming] Give me that sweet whisper! Just a guard. One of the guards. What the fuck! I run up to the guard and check his pulse. Is he still alive or is he paralyzed? Yeah, but get under the tent! We can get the drop! Exactly, we can't get framed! And did it look like the same figure? Towards Ustaloch! It's the fucking lake! [crosstalk] See, here's my thing. Does anyone else notice that the zombie transformations seem like a serpent shedding its skin? Because they always slough off their skin? Wait, what?
