Why am I not surprised? What's that? It's actually going to play during the break. Yeah! Yeah, yeah! You'll like it! So stick around! Haley Joel Osment. Also, your Date with Matt Mercer in a Silk Robe, thanks to Brian Wayne Foster, will be up on YouTube tomorrow at 10AM. Is that okay? Brought peace to the world forever. Nothing bad will ever happen again. For anyone who's watching, this is like, abduction, how to not-- 101, self-defense. It's just, it looked ominous. That's true! Remember that guy. Five-letter words is a big deal! Does he get exhausted from reading? If he gets mentally exhausted from reading. Takes a point of exhaustion when he tries to read. Does he still have Fassbender? Some Tree Bark that Keyleth made. Definitely Bear Claws, yeah. Out of Whitestone, of course. We should just do this tomorrow. We should do it tomorrow. Yeah. Plus, small-business tax breaks, it was good all the way around. What? Chief. Yeah, since Keyleth-- the mantle's a little heavy and flashy and a little formal to wear all the time, but wanted something to still represent my chiefdom. Keyleth goes hard, yeah. No, I got the traditional Ashari tattoos of the mantle across her chest and shoulders to mimic that. It took a while. It's old needle-and-hammer style. All traditional. See, he got the antlers. Okay, so once again, lot of intertwining starting to go on. Got our tattoos, took a little bit of time. One of the big things that Keyleth did over the course of the year, which took a massive majority of her time, was she went on a diplomacy mission to all four of the tribes as well as Emon and Whitestone, and with the help of Percy and Tary, we came up with a system that we are calling the Crisis Orbs system, is what you called it? Where we put magical orbs in each of the cities that are basically giant panic beacons. And each city got assigned a separate color, to where if anything goes terribly wrong, someone can hit that beacon and all of the crystals will light up and whoever can respond first will do so. It's like how calling 911 is illegal. You don't do that. You don't do that.. Yes, 'cause Keyleth does definitely-- Keyleth and a lot of the other Ashari dealt with a little bit of guilt after Cinderking Thordak, and wanted to make sure that if anything tragically goes wrong again, we can potentially be faster to respond. And have allies nearby. So that was a massive part of it. I also went to Whitestone and grabbed a little sprig off of the Sun Tree to propagate one of my own trees back in Vesrah. Spent a lot of time working on my alchemy, in between. I imagine we have would have crafting parties in Whitestone, yeah? And then, you know, I would do some alchemy. Yeah, yeah. It was great. It was great. And he made dragon armor. Took trips with Vax, and had him as my right-hand man. Sir Vax. The Gothy One. Such a good show. No, we were the ones that could. Correct. Sorry. The Royal Troupe of the-- TALIESIN AND Tropical vacation. Did she get a dope crown? Mantle sisters! That's right, that's right. And we inform him that we buried his wife's ashes. Yes, yes. Okay, Percy, do your thing. Do we come back in, like, two weeks? He'll call? Okay. Is this like a-- do we wait here? I use it to affix my mantle. You helped me unify the world, globally. You know, I've crafted him some oils with some herbs. He's good. I helped him manscape a bit, it's good. Wait, are we sailing or are we bamfing? And we didn't go sailing with Pike. Do you have, like, a racial advantage to find a place like this? Teach us your upper-white-male ways! Oh my God. Yeah, we might hop around. AAA discounts? (laughter) That's fair. We never spend money on ourselves. Yeah, Keyleth runs out and goes, who wants to go scuba-diving? 'Cause I can Water Breathe us, and we can go look at the coral reefs! Okay! We do that. We do that at some point, throughout the week. It's like the Bermuda Triangle! I turn to Pike and Vex and go, hey! Hey! Underwater tea party! Can I look for shark's teeth? That's fun! Can I do a nature check? 17. Cool. Tattoo's looking good, though. You know salt water is bad for the armor, right? You should. You're with the worst sandcastle partner. It took us a year. Oh shit. Definitely some magically frozen daiquiris. I just showered, you guys, now's not a good time. I'm just-- Hi, Vex. I feel like we're in trouble. There are dogs? (gasps) What kind of dogs are they? Okay. Yeah, of course. Is our room nearby? Did he see me get shoved in? Hey, Vax? I think they're really mad at us. That's the trolliest thing you've said, ever! I have to say, wherever these dogs came from, they're very beautiful dogs. Look purebred. Very great muscular structure. Come here, boys. Come here! Can I Speak With Animals to them? Come here, boys. Come here. I take out some beef jerky. Come here. That's good boys. Good boys. Fish jerky from where we were at the casino earlier. As Liam O'Brien said, it's improv, so that makes it true! Right, so just like the internet, if you say it, it's real. Come here, boys. Oh, it smells. You boys did a number in this room. Okay. (laughter) That's a one. Fuck these dogs! That's why you said we should never own dogs. Percy? I didn't do this! I'm more than happy to help, but I just want you to know I had nothing to do with this. It smells like shit. Like a giant fucking locker down shit in here. I'm going to cast Control Water. Can I magic this clean-up like it's Fantasia or some shit? No, can I Control Water and levitate the urine? I am the leader of my tribe, and I am doing janitorial duties. Ugh. Fucking Vox Machina pieces of-- why am I-- why are we us? Okay, I control the water and fling it into the ocean. I control a little of the urine that dribbled in the hall, as well. I don't want us to get kicked out by the hotel. Wild ocean dogs. Beach dogs. You tell us, man. What the fuck, man? What is he throwing away? I don't think he's very sanitary. We catch up on so much gossip. "We shouldn't test the fates, let's flip a coin." (laughter) I've got one on hand right now, beotches. Here it is. Moving on from that scene before they change their mind. Oh, rad. Can I go check in with the Sun Tree while I'm here? I come up and say, hey, Sun Tree. Casting Speak With Plants, of course. Hey! It's been so long. You're looking so good. So healthy. Yeah? Have you been working out? Sure. Yeah. How's it been? Whitestone seems so much better. Seems happier. Has morale been up? Yeah? Yeah? Do the kids sometimes climb in you? Do you like that? No? Oh, right. Really? Should I put a Do Not Climb sign on you? Would you like that? No. I could stake it in the ground around you. Okay. Anything to make you more comfortable, man. Yeah. Oh, thanks. Anyway, is there anything else that you need? Any new news? Anything going on? Right? Thought that winter would last forever, right? Oh, yeah? But you're still good. Oh, you know. Keeping busy, keeping on keeping on, you know? It's been good. You're like the coolest person I know, and you're a tree. It's weird. Even after a year, it's like talking to an old friend. It's good. Oh, look! Some of these flowers are getting a little pink, Sun Tree. No, that's all. It's actually getting a little awkward now. It's gone on for a little long. I just wanted to make sure you were cool. Yeah. Awesome. Okay, I'll see you around. Bye. I'll wait for him to text me first. Yeah. It's the rule. Long time. Owners. Does she walk past the Sun Tree when I'm having a random conversation with no one? Rolling really shitty tonight. Let's see what happens. Oh, that's good! That's much better. Straight perception? 30. It's about that time I'm like, okay, bye, Sun Tree. And then I'm going to Beast Shape into a crow and start circling her. Poop on the way up. JB? Keyleth flies down and lands on Pike's shoulder. I bamf out of my Beast Shape. Whoa! What? You sent money? You've told us very vague amounts about your family. It was surprising. You haven't talked about them too much, just that they're shady. You know, we love you, and family or not, if anyone tries to fucking use you, we will-- All right. I just don't want anyone taking advantage of you. Have you kept in contact with any of them until recently? Here. And I dab her brow off a little. Do you need anything? Do you need anything to look cool? Okay. I pull out my oils that I use on Vax. Here you go. You're good. Much better. Did he say weeks? Did he slip that in? Can I assist him on that? Individuals? 26. I'm a guest, foreigner, just like you. Passing through. Traveling on. Can I insight check that? I don't trust your "married in this bullshit" shit. 20, total. We could always go hunting for our dinner. Classic way. I just don't like it when people try to take advantage of my friends, but they're family, and if anyone is in need, I don't want to potentially put them out. We can just keep an eye out. I'm protective. I say to Vax Just keep an eye on the odd one, all right? It's a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Popcorn. And Keyleth goes-- ASHLEY If she looks over at me, I'm going-- Freaky Friday! I check my pouch and make sure my antlers are still there. And I liked seeing you being bested. Regardless of the people, it's still fun seeing you being bested. No premonitions of a curse from Wilhand? Hang on. I don't mean to question everything, but Wilhand defected from the whole family and became a cleric, but he never mentioned anything of a curse? Why did he become a cleric? That seems like a dichotomy there. Or he's terrified of some superstitious curse. Maybe both? That's accurate. I can get us anywhere very quickly. I think it would be a half-and-half situation. And Wilhand is the brother of Ogden? Wilhand's older than Ogden?! I thought Ogden was as old as life itself! He had a Mick Jagger lifestyle. All right. All right. Maybe you could do a Grog tour and then a Percy tour. The two masters of the city. Of course. "And this was my first hook-up, and this was the scene of my second hook-up." Sprinting from the airport. Bamfing? We're all a year older now! We're older!
