Yes! 826LA is a charity that focuses on tutoring children in an after-school program and helping specifically with creativity, storytelling, art and general things that relate to Dungeons & Dragons. You should definitely check out the Time Travel Mart. There is one in Echo Park and one in Mar Vista. They have this amazing storefront where you can buy these awesome tchotchkes and things that go immediately to support the charity and the stream. It's awesome. It's 826LA, you should look it up. There's a few all over the country. I am Keyleth, the druid from the tribe of the Air Ashari. I am a half-elven person. No, half-elf. Yeah, Come on, man. I've been half-elf since day one. Half-elven. Yes! You can see me shooting lightning and turning into awesome animals. Oh, I'm Marisha Ray, by the way. Did I say that? Yes. We were at the door. We were talking to someone right? I feel like we're being hazed. Make it rain. Yeah! We'll bunk up. Wait. I thought we were going to be heading south? Wait, how many Greypsines are there? Ironkeeper what? So racist. How did your friend get this nasty cut? Oh. I'm sorry. I think. So many racist comments. Jeez! Oh, that's-- we did promise that. I don't know. It's like living in Alaska. Dwarven Alaska. Take him a drink! I know! He realized he was sinking. Why is he coming towards us? (whispered to Laura) You're better at this than I am. Hi, Balgus. Yes! I reach out and I stroke his bicep because I can't hear that. I'm really low in charisma. I'm really awkward. Persuasion. I rolled a two? Plus my persuasion of zero, because I have a shitty charisma. I didn't say anything. I just touched him! Ass mines? Oh, I thought you meant like, mines that ex-- Sorry. Go ahead. No, ass minds. Yes, they have ass minds. It seems that you aren't challenged often in business and in fighting. Gee, I'm so glad you came over. What was the first thing you rolled? Definitely take that 18. Persuasion. He's pretty charismatic. Can I do a persuasion check-- a perception check to see if he's lying? 27. Top shelf at BevMo! I thought we like used it as a weapon. I thought we threw it at somebody. Oh, absolutely. Percy and I spend some time making some really nice comment cards for-- For what's his name? We're going to make some wonderful comment cards for Balan. Dexterity. Damn gated communities. I have a feeling they're not going to respond to the crazy guy. We're making comment cards! Yes! Yes, because-- what was it? Baldus, Beldus? Balan! Balan was so nice! Don't die! I should have come with you! Then I could-- What? Yes! here! Here you go, here you go-- I run down to with Grog. Oh no! I cast a fog. Over the ring. Okay, I run up in the fog, and I tap Trinket and I whisper in Trinket's ear and I say Trinket, I'm tapping you out. And I turn into a bear like Trinket! Wait. First, I Polymorph Trinket into a squirrel. I can. No, a mouse, like a rat. I say Scanlan! Catch Trinket! Then I bear form up. Oh, that's right. No, he's close enough! Man, come on, I've been around Trinket enough. ORION and I'm a bear and-- What happened? Okay, that's a good idea. I see her as my trainer. I'm like (growling). I'm circus bear-ing. You should give me a fez! Can you Prestidigitation me a fez? Natural 20! (cheering) It's a natural 20! No, I want to save it! I'm inspired, for later. I will think back to that moment. Yeah. I'm still dancing! (growls) Yeah, and I guess I can let Trinket change out of mouse form. Oh, does he have a tiny armor mouse? Mouse armor! Yeah. How long can I keep her a mouse? Up to an hour? Yeah. Take a nap. Oh, we should give our comment cards to Balgus. Balan. Here, take him the extras. Yes. A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise underestimate her based on first impressions. [thunder crack] Dwarven eggs are very good. Why did you think that after the magic hand failed that the big thunder ice wave would work? That's okay. It's the thought that counts, Grog. It's the thought that counts. Yeah, I know. Yes! You should be a lady dwarf. That's also where the hashtag not all trolls came from. Bringing it back. Percy, can I try? Okay! I just wanted to do that once! I'm sorry. He's on vacation. You'll have to excuse him. You know, friends are in town, he's showing us around. Ask if he needs assistance or divergent-- Divergent. Forge some thieves' tools real quick. Wait. Before we go up, I take the cask of ale and I grow some pretty flowers on it, and I make a nice pretty bow and I shine it up a little. No, I'm just-- it looks attractive now. It does not look like a fruit basket. It's not that ostentatious. Druidcraft. That's hot. Or broken toes, if you will. It also sounds like there are some other terrible things wreaking havoc on your mines. Wait, before we dive into this mountain-- we know that there's ghouls and god knows what else down there. Shouldn't we find out? Come on! Take the flask, take the flask. Is there anybody running out? I grab one of them. Don't you have family history with them? I throw Entangle up, in the distance wherever they're coming from. Like a hundred feet. Oh, 20-foot radius. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck. Goddamn it. You rolled a 20? Oh, I rolled a two. Is there anything that you know? Four. To be fair I just cast Entangle. It works. I'm distracted holding Entangle. Bust out Bad News! Have you used it before? Does that critical for you? Come on! Big money, no whammies. Yeah! Hell yeah! Is that doubled? Nothing travels faster. They're all entangled, yeah? Still have Entagle up. Boo! With my vines, I make sure my vines really grapple him. (valley girl voice) They are so dead. What happened? Why are we doing this? 20 total. 20. Oh, no! I still have Entangle up. Poop. I didn't call my mom enough. Okay. I do a quick sprint jog up up towards Grog and go (boof) and bring up a big stone wall. Right where that entrance is. No. Like, right where things are pouring out. Yeah. Wall of Stone-- boom. We don't know what's in there, we should talk about this for a second, and I bought us some time. I'm sure it's going to try to beat through that door in a second. Are there any guards around still? Any dwarven guards? I throw up my wall and turn around and I say What's coming?! Tell us! You know what's coming. What's coming?! I'm not good at this. Oh, four. (laughter and groaning) We are about to die. It is in your best interest to tell us. What kind of things? From where? I cast Stoneskin on myself. Can I move up behind that pillar? I still have mine that I haven't used yet. Do naga heads do something if you look at them? This is a good time to note our charity, 826LA. I love your joy sounds! Yeah. What the fuck! I'm glad I cast Stoneskin. Yeah. Six, four and six? I should have taken the poison resistance. He talked me out of it. What am I--constitution. Fuck! It's a bad day. 31, on top of the six, four and six? Took me down to 16 hit points. Help me. Help! Okay, so I'm really upset, really hurting. Out of anger I take my staff and I go (bam) and I crack and do Thunderwave pushing him back 15 feet. Okay, 2d8. Oh sorry. It takes four damage. Then I'm going to turn into an eagle. And I fly away. Far, far, away. Then I cry in the corner and rock back and forth a little bit. That's my turn. Wait! Is this the first time you've-- Thanks for the heads up.
