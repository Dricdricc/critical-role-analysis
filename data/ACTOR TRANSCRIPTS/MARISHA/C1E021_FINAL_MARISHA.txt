Speaking of the Wills, just to talk about the first two giveaways that we reached. That's it. Once it hits the board, it's done. It's like the American flag. These are TableTop nail wrap-specific. Yes, these are Espionage Cosmetics nail wraps, and they're actual TableTop-- So yes. Wear the support on your fingertips. Hopefully you don't fail at that, too. Only because of the dice, not because of your choices. So 826LA, our charity. Everyone should go check them out; they have amazing storefronts in cities all across the country. The one here is themed after time travel in Echo Park. And also in Marina Del Rey; that's the other city that I'm trying to think of. But yes, a portion of all of our donations go to them, and they're amazing, so thank you so much. And thank you for everyone who has donated in the past. We love you. And I think we are going to be doing a video. I know I've been saying that for a while, but we have a date scheduled now! It is happening. We have a way for everyone to get back in town, but it's going to happen, and we're going to have a field trip. How long ago did you send that e-mail? Oh, are we going into our intro? Good start. Come on, Wil. And Espionage Cosmetic nail wraps! Six. (laughs) Kash money. Wait, they're all here. Here's an eight. Wait, that's a ten. That's a ten-sider. This one. Big money, no whammies. That's really good. Yes, abacus. Oh, you burned my new robes! Ugh. I've knitted a sweater while Tiberius took his turn. Yeah. 14 and five, you said? Nope. I look at them and I go, (rat noises). (laughs) Not yet. I take the tentacle that's grappled around me and I grab onto it, and I cast Blight. It has to make a constitution saving throw. 3rd. 18. Yes, it does. Where'd all my d8s go? Here's one. Ooh, there's four, so five, six. Seven. I just like rolling all of them I could roll. Okay. That's all right. There's ten, there's 20, there's 35. Sorry. Yes, 36 damage. Yes. It's fine. Do it! I was hoping you weren't talking about me. Oh, nice. Not bad. Oh, plus nine. Which is 1d8 plus three. That hits. 16. Oh good, you showed up! Yeah. No! (squeaking noises) My turn? Okay, are rats swarming me? This guy's looking pretty close to dead, yeah? He's looking pretty hurt? I'm going to do it again. I'm going to do Blight again. Yeah. I'm still grappled, right? So just same thing, I'm just going to (sucking sound) try and suck the life out of this guy. Constitution saving throw. (laughs, counts) I need one more, where's it at? Big money, no whammies. Ooh, that's not bad. Okay, so that's 14, 15, 16, 24, 30, 32, 35, 41, 45. Dead? Come on. You can do it. It's rats! That's just a bruised ego. That's different. Kill some rats. Smart rats. I know. I got scorched by Tiberius's fireball. (Fonzie impressions) Hey. I follow him. What's above us? And there's nothing really in the prison cells, with the exception of one skeleton? Yeah, I'll look around in the cells. Natural 20! Vax. Need your help; this is locked. Looks like a fresh dead guy? And he's a dusk-what Bastion? Shapeshifter. Ask him if he knows which direction he went, and if he has a hideout. Well, he or she or whatever it was. Which direction was the dwarf walking? But he said he's been coming and going, so maybe he was just leaving? And which god is that? Why did she spare you? And how does that happen in the first place? We can walk and talk. You guys go. So who's it partially covering? Thorbir. 15. Uh. I throw up a Wall of Stone. Right there. To lock them in. It's permanent! So Kashaw. If you're the only one who knows about this goddess, that means she also killed your parents? Oh my god. Oh, again? Man, we're going to run into everything. Nine. A charisma saving throw? Okay. 11. Sorry, guys. I don't even know what to do. 17. It's okay. Just keep me alive, Cashew. It makes its saving throw? So he just punched me for no reason? I have 13 hit points. Fail it. Something I'll never say to you. What's his DC? What's your DC? Or is it versus his wisdom? Sorry, Cashew. Ooh, critical fail. I don't want to! My favorite staff! Can we not try and save from it? We can't do shit? We're just on auto-pilot, at this point? Crush who? It's not going to be good. Yeah, I rolled an 18. Probably unconscious. I'm unconscious. Oh my god! It's also been way over a minute. Yeah, we're only rolling with magical weapons at this point, yo. I'm unconscious. Oh, right. Because I'm unconscious. Seven. An attack roll or saving throw? Can he target me? And would it work for my saving throws? (sighs) Let's use this one. This is a big, shiny die. 17. I'm good! War and Peace? Eight. Someone pump some life into me! (gasps) They were so cold. Oh, they left? You scared them with positive energy? Are you moving forward? Wait. Vax, slow down. You guys. Can I get some healing? Will you use some of that positive energy on me? Vax? Can we make camp? I'm hurting really bad. Just take a rest. Actually, I have something that I think will make us all feel better. And I prepare a Heroes' Feast. I do now. I'll tell you. Yes, it's the 20-foot-long Subway dealio. Like 3k, I think. All right, fine. I'll do it. You guys, I've just had a near-death experience. I've been craving some lasagna. Okay? So I'm going to make some of the best goddamn lasagna we've ever had in our life. I'm going to spend a thousand dollars and make some amazing fucking lasagna. A thousand gold. Okay, everybody. Close your eyes. Okay? Tiberius, will you make the little forks dance for me with Mage Hand? Okay. Are you guys ready? (singing) Be our guest, be our guest, put our service to the test! Look, I'm making a musical out of our food. People pay a lot of money for this. I thought that was funny. So after we eat all of this food, we are cured of all diseases and poisons. We become immune to poison and being frightened, and all of our wisdom saving throws have advantage. Also, our maximum hit points increase by 2d10. 24 hours. And you gain the same number of hit points. So don't spend any of your hit dice. We're going to eat our way to health. And it gains the same number of hit points. Oh. Okay. I see what it means. Why did you burn all of your sorcerer points? We told you not to burn all of your sorcerer points. We don't have time to sit here and take a full rest. You can ask the group, but I have a feeling that Vax and Thorbir aren't going to want to take a full rest down here. 24 hours. So we can still take a long rest and still have benefits from the feast. It lasts for 24 hours. I actually have a Locate Creature spell. I can do it. Well, the cleric is burned out of 4th-level spells. Cleric is good. Can I get another healing spell, then, Cashew? Oh, that would be great. So what are those? 2d8? I did. 8d4? (quietly) Let me get more d4s out. I'll do this twice. That will be enough. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Oh, that's good. Eight, so that's 15, 19, 22, plus another eight? So 30. Cool. Awesome. I mean, you knew we were on a time crunch, Tiberius. We were chasing him down a hall. Actually, you know what? Here's what I'm going to do instead. Let me double-check and make sure I can do this. Let me wait until he opens this door. Okay, now I'm going to drop to my knees and cast Locate Creature. Just a staircase up? I'm sorry. I think we're going to need to go through the acid. Oh, wait. We brought the flying carpet with us. It's in your Bag of Holding. Why don't we pull that out? Acid pit! [break] Yes. We all fit on it, right? Oh! We took a short rest. I could. We have flying carpets. Okay, we all fit! We're good. Let's go. Onward! I make a nice little wind zephyr to give us a little airflow. 19. Could I do a history check? Why not? 12. Wisdom saving throws. Continue. Oh my god. Can I cast Wall of Stone and make a big stone underneath of us to support the carpet? Let's use this one. Add my what? Constitution saving throw? Why? 13. I go eagle. Can I fly and pick up Brother Kash, as an eagle, and try and fly and drag him to the shore? No, he's a human. Wait, carpet's in the acid? Grab the carpet. Grab the carpet with you, Kash! Can you Prestidigitation that shit off? (caws) (screech) Actually, eagles sound like shit. They use a raptor or something like that. Eagles don't actually sound like that. Eagles are actually like, (weak squawk). Tiberius. (caws) Sorry! He's more important. (caws) Fix that shit. And then I go back for Thorbir. Hurry. Quick! Come on, Tiberius. Maybe get the acid off it first. And remember, if everyone rolled 2d12, you get that added to your maximum hit points, from your meal. Fuck. Yeah. Oh god. We just heard them scream from the other room. Oh my god. Yeah, they did. We're sorry! Why are you being so poopy today, Tiberius? We've had a lot of good times. Fuck. Vex is going to be so angry. I give Vax a hug. It's like a member of our family, man. We almost lost the carpet that one time, too, and we found it. I'm sorry. We can hang it up like a tapestry. That would be nice. Kashaw, does this mean anything to you? Master of politicians and deception. Why don't you come out and speak to us face to face, Hosier? Or Hosien? Ah, so your real name is Hotis. He serves the god of politics and deception. I'm assuming. Well, I'm assuming if he's got the statue of-- Oh my god. Not bad. 23. 23. Oh, son of a bitch. I want to cast Faerie Fire in that direction, right where I see the glimmer. Oh shit. 13. Me. Rakshasa. So I don't get Faerie Fire off on him first? You have advantage on wisdom saving throws. Just throwing it out there. I love that you felt like you had to clarify. He's smart. Dagger, dagger, dagger. What's that? Ooh, yeah! Natural 19. 19. 24. How much was the first one? Yeah, you get plus two to all your healing spells. Nice! Plus two. Back up to full. And remember, you get plus 2d12 to your max hit points because we ate good food. Nothing beats a home-cooked meal. Faerie Fire, right on the rakshasa. Son of a bitch. I look at him, and I go, um? And now I'm going Minxie. Going Minxie! Tiger on tiger! I'm going for rakshasa, so I'm going to head this way. Speed is 40. Yeah, that's fine. Bring it. I'm there. Good to know. (roars) So I'm going to do my bite attack. And I get to add this? To damage? Okay, so that's 15? Sorry. Do I get to keep this, or was that the only time? You crit on an 18? Do I get a free attack? (growls) Nope. Advantage! I'm so glad I made such a hearty meal. Is this something he can save from, though? Take Wil's dice. Nope. Oh, that's right! Oh, did you save from it? Dope. Do it. We need our healer. I know. It's crazy, because it scales for players. And that does to everybody? All right. I'm still pretty close to the rakshasa, right? All right, hitting it with my bite attack. Ooh, that's much better. Chopper, sic balls. That just made my night, in many ways. Okay, 21. Yes, they are, because Circle of the Moon, baby. Yes, I do. Circle of the Moon. So that does 1d10 plus six piercing damage. Where's my d10s? That's eight piercing damage from my bite. (growls) And then I do my claws, which happen twice. That was eight damage. Piercing damage. And then yeah, that's good, too. What's my alignment? I'm good. I'm Keyleth. I'm neutral good. 22 for the first one. Hang on, do I get two claw attacks, or just one? "Clow." My "clows." It says-- oh, wait. Yeah. I have a pounce. I guess I don't have a multi-attack. So I just have the bite attack? Or do I also get a claw attack, as well, as my two actions? One is piercing, and one is slashing, right? So I'll do my bite. (growls) I go, (growls) right back to him. I'm up in his ass. (growls) Bite. No. Son of a cock. Nothing for me. Four, so 13 total. That's 20. Awesome. I'm going to do my bite attack again. Oh, wait. That's a d20. Eight damage. Piercing damage again. Kill this thing. Piercing damage, yo. All those blue guys. Yeah. Okay. Since he's floating, I'm going to go, (growls) and go for the spiritual guardian. Ooh, the first one is a 21. Oh, sorry. 22. Can it be a pounce? Was I far enough away? Then fuck yeah, it's a pounce. So does he succeed his strength saving throw, DC 14? Then he is knocked prone. And then I make a bite attack, which is a 19. Ooh, that's not good, in terms of damage. Seven damage. Dex save. (laugh) Tiberius! No, that's not how it works. Yeah. That's how my ring works, as well. It's a level-5 Ring of Storing. We go to 11. Come on. I don't think so. Okay. Oh, take that 19. Fucking kill it! Oh, he's fucking trying to leave! Ugh, I'm out of alcohol. It's the worst time to be out. Okay. I go over to it, and I bust out my book, and I start harvesting all the parts we need. Who's got the contract? What all do we need? We signed it, after, and left it somewhere. Might have ended up in storage. The fangs and the tongue. We found it! I got it. Cool. Okay, I have my book, which I think gives me advantage, I think is how it works? Yeah. Okay, gives me advantage. So I have to do this individually for each one, correct? Two at a time? Okay, first for the eyes and tongue. Ooh, I'll take that 18 and 20. Natural 20. That's for the eyes. Tongue. I'll also take that natural 20. I'll take that. And for the heart. That's 16 total. Here, hold this. Okay. The claws. Oh, I'll take that 19! 30. Oh, sorry. 29. And the canine teeth. I'll take that 15 for 25. Total. Tiberius? Do you have any vials left over? Empty vials? Can I try and harvest some of the blood, as well, to keep for personal use? Are you squeamish about blood, Kashaw? One vial? Right before we leave, I turn and have a piece of pelt from the rakshasa, and I throw it at the guard's feet, and I say, here. That's what's left of your boss. I take a canvas bag and I plop it on the table, full of the rakshasa bits. Tiberius. And our counterparts? The rest of our party, have they returned? Have they checked in yet? Please do. Where are we staying? We'll wait here. 1,020 gold? It's so insane. Keyleth got her first kiss! So good. Moments that Keyleth has dreamed of. We fucking lived! Oh my god. I got pink in the face. In real life. I have a cowboy who just rode into the sunset, you guys.
