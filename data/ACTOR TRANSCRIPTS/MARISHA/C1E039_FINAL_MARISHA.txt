Beautiful. Valentine's Day Weekend. It's for you to find out, all right. Thanks. I designed it like this. It's subversive. It's what you see in the art. Oh, I want to see the two side-by-side. Yes, there's a Kickstarter up right now called Lost Hope the Series, that I'm a part of. It's like Battlestar Galactica meets Archer and, yeah. I voice a character named Simmons in there. It's fun. Go check it out. I like this sweater, is this new? Oh god! I got pretty wasted. 19. Pike and I are hiding, too. Can I do, like, a nature check on this thing to see if I can discern any type of information on it? Just straight intelligence? That's not good. I think that is a five? Six! Six! I'm just going to whisper to Pike, and be like It doesn't have any eyes! I feel like we shouldn't move! Okay! I, like, hold her shoulder pads so she doesn't clink any. Okay! I'm going to stay right here! I'm just, I'm just going to, I don't want to move. I'm just going to wait. I don't want to move! Am I able to take a bonus action to like shout something out over comms? Yeah? Everyone should try and get a little bit so I can see you. And I can make us all fly. I learned it today. But you have to be within 30 feet of me. You know, imagine I said it more succinctly than this. Yeah. Hey, move down a bit so you're not in my way. (laughs) Pukes ice? Here's what I want to try and do. I want to try and hope to god I can get everyone in here. I wanted to-- oh wait, I'm trying to point the fucking-- point the laser at the screen. I want to try and go-- five, ten, 15-- can I go through Grog? Through there? Can I go there? Wait, wait, back closer to the-- I want to be able to try and-- can I see Scanlan and stuff, over there? All right. Everyone, I guess, who's within 30 range of me, I'm going to do a wind blast, and we all turn into poofy cloud versions of ourselves. Wind Walk. Poofy Cloud. So as I run past Grog, I brush his shoulder, and he turns into a mist form, and I turn into a mist form, and then I blast it out, and everyone's mist form! Oh, you can't attack? No, we're still there. Man, that was going to be way cooler if we could still... It was a 6th-level spell. Thanks, guys. I feel so validated. I did just learn it yesterday. We could try and get the fuck out of here. We could use this to our advantage and get the fuck away, so I don't feel like I just wasted a 6th-level spell. Just want to say. I technically do, but fuck that. I did learn Dispel Magic, but-- No! Figure it out! Make it work for yourselves, assholes. That was a 6th-level spell, god damn it. Yeah! It's ten people! We're all shit out of luck! How does that feel? I thought we could still attack, which would be way dope. If you don't move, they'll go away. Shut up, Taliesin. Oh that's right, it was sick, right? Yeah he's really married to this one. Wait, what? No, no, no! One-- Oh no, yeah, you're right. Yeah, can I not kill it at all? I can't kill it? Question. Can I switch to an animal form? Why would you do that? Dex save? Regular dexterity save or do we get advantage because we're misty? Do we have advantage? I don't think I made my dexterity check. A two. What? Shut up, Liam. 16. All right, 32. Does that mean we could just get them fighting each other? Okay, here's my question. I know. (laughter) I will say, we all failed in reading it, also-- Nothing. Nothing. I'm afraid now. Yeah, what were you going to say? (laughs) I like that question. We all failed in reading it. One minute. It says one action on yours? It says one minute on mine. Yes, it does. No, it's different. It says casting time one minute. It already happened, so it doesn't matter. Yeah, it's already happened, we're already committed. One minute. So Fight Club failed. I mean, I'm still willing to commit to it. It's fine. So I accelerated the casting of the spell. Are you giving me an out because you feel bad? Because if you're giving me an out-- He did read the card too, and we all thought it was a good idea. (laughing) For my own shame. All right fine, I'll drop the spell 'cause I feel really bad about it. But on my way down, okay, here's my question, because I want to make these fuckers fight each other. So, is there loose rock along the edge of the wall? Okay, so as I'm dropping the spell-- As I revert back can I slide down that wall to create some-- Yeah. Uh-huh, I drop the spell, and as I drop the spell I want to grab some wall and bring it down to make a big vibration, right in between these two motherfuckers. Oh, jeez Louise. Oh, that's not too bad. It's not a saving throw. 18? Uh-huh. Do I have any movement? Oh, Jesus Christ. Can I just tiptoe backwards towards Percy? Or should I-- You know what? I'm going to stay. I'm just going to stay right there. Is that even worse of a decision? I'm just going to-- up against the wall. And not move. I'm going to Doctor Grant it. I hold my breath. You also see me against a wall right next to you. I love that song! Thanks for that. Yeah. No. Bringing it to a total of 22? I deserved that. So does it know that I'm there since it just took a big chunk out of me? All right. I'm in arm's length of it, right? I'm going to reach out and cast Blight on it. 18. Oh, jeez. What was that? Seven. Seven plus five. Seven, eight, 13, 16, and then another 12. Where was I at? 18. Oh, so 28, 32, 33 points. I'm going to once again not move. Can I go ahead and cast Healing Word on myself? Nine, total. That does help. (singing) Purple worm. Come on, fight the big cocksucker. You misfire on a seven or lower? Holy shit, Taliesin! Come on, Golden Snitch! Thank god! Such an asshole. You're unconscious? Ooh! Good work, Grog. Hi, Grog. It was very good, yeah! You did good! How do you know that!? Yeah! They were trying to kill each other! Scanlan, that's only your relationships! I take out like my little filet knife and I start going to town on the frost worm in front of me, trying to salvage anything that I can from him. My book! I got my book! It's me. I got my book, which gives me advantage. 29. Can I vial any of the blood? Yeah, I want to do that. And I'm going to take that mandible if I can. Yeah. What do you want? Yeah. Yeah. We were trying to do this before. We were trying to melt his face because Pike was going to do a talk to dead spell. Well, I guess we're taking the body? I'll focus my heat on his feet so we can just dislodge him and throw him over our shoulder and go. How much time is it going to take them to get the gold? How about this, let's spend five minutes doing all this stuff and see where we're at. Son of a bitch, we should go. Sorry about that whole cloud mist thing, you guys. I was trying to-- Yeah. Sorry about that. Thanks, Vex. Look, it was something new, I'm still working out the kinks, all right? I'm working out the kinks. I'm sorry. It'll be really cool next time I try it. I'm still really confused as to why we came back here to begin with. Right, well, that's been confirmed, it's not. Quarantine the house? I'm still really confused as to why we are trying to maintain honor to inhonorable people. How is this going to sound to Uriel? Excuse me, Uriel, just want to let you know that we broke into General Krieg's old house and found out it's really dangerous. Can we have it? Well, I'm just saying, how do we phrase this? And what happens when he asks why we were there in the first place? I don't know All of your items can be purchased. Oh, it's reverse whispering! Wet willie. Okay, okay. We're running out of the house. Christ. The house just collapses. Since when, Grog? But you haven't been drinking today. Who all is around to see this? Pike, can you discern what kind of entity this might be attached to? Okay. Is that all you have, Pike? That's all you can find out? Yeah, no one touch the-- Is it just laying on the floor right now? No. But Percy, to be fair, you've had a bit of a weakness with, you know, evil entities being attached to you. No, it's not going to-- It's not granting anyone's wish. I mean, if want to sleep a day, we can all just bamf back. We can tree stride back to Whitestone, if we want to take a nap. Well, I've already spent my one 6th-level spell turning us into fucking clouds. Yeah. Honestly, if I would've turned everyone into a cloud-- Who has to deal with the house? What, hang on, Grog. You were-- Yes. Exactly. The portal has to be crushed? Why was it talking through you, Grog? Why not Pike? If you can ask it questions, maybe we could ask it a few more questions? What time is it? I guess I'll go with Percy and take the skull, and I'll make sure we put it somewhere safe in the keep, if you guys want to go talk to Uriel. Do you want to come with us, Pike? Do you want to be with the skull, Pike, or do you want to go talk to Uriel? Well, it sounds like they've already-- they're sending other people to get her out. What's the big deal? Oh, she's 'quite special' to you, yeah? Why is that creepy? But you were courting her two days ago. I thought she spent the night in your room. That's true. What? Wait, what? Like an aunt? You tried to sleep with your baby daddy? Oh, wow. Well, that's-- Why do you keep saying she's 'related to' you? Why don't you just call her exactly what she is? Which is your daughter. That's weird to be like, 'my child is related to me.' Who do you want to take? You pick your dodgeball team. So many secrets! All right. Can I heal myself up first? Oh wait, Pike! Will you hook us up? Dope. Huh? I'm at 65 now, with that. So I'm still 30 under. How much? 4,000? I'm going to whisper to Scanlan. I'm going to say, I'm going to stay back. You go ahead. That was the most privileged thing you've ever said. Touch√©. I've got Polymorph. I can always be a tiny thing in your pocket. Sorry, I'm back here. I figured Percy and I were waiting back here. Do you have gold, Scanlan? No trips to Coldstone with Percy. You are not the Godfather. About this time, I come over the earpiece and I go, how's it going in there, guys? Good. Just let me know if you need me. They were tossing your ass out. I'm glad I came in handy for that field trip. I liked them. They were fun. Maybe they thought we were even? Yeah, what the fuck? What's with Jarett? They were good drinking buddies. A 20 by six foot canvas? Percy and I go downstairs to make sure the skull is still there. Beautiful. What time is it? I guess so. We stashed it. Yeah. Percy, maybe me and you should make some reinforcements or something? But we'd have to put it with someone else, right? Once a day. I know. Or else I would totally run it over and run it back. Oh, if I use your thing? I could. What if she doesn't come? I'd be using a 6th-level spell as a glorified messenger? 'Hey, we found a scary skull.' You know what, Scanlan, why don't you figure out how to get the damn skull back to Whitestone by yourself, how's that? Nothing happened last night, but it seems like a ticking time bomb. I mean, I could-- all right. I could Wall Of Stone another kind of box around it. All right. I guess we're staying in town. Seems okay. Yeah, let's post someone here, I guess. Yeah, you're great. Don't let anyone in or out. I'm just saying. All right. Okay? 29. Vax? Vax! Nope. Rich people clapping, sure. Raishan? No, what?! Wait, did you say four? He didn't say four. LAURA and Oh Jesus Christ, Taliesin. Are we just fighting one? Holy balls! 15 as well. I dunno, what the fuck do we do? Dragon. It has an AC of 22. It's some bullshit. We had no fucking reason to go into that basement. Am I in there as well? Seven. Holy fuck, he just took out the entire council. Are there any trees nearby? No shit-- I didn't learn it! Go ahead. 100 feet?! All right, everyone's around me, more or less? I slam my staff on the ground and I cast Anti-Life Shell and I say, (shouts) everyone in the shell-- we're running! It's not that big. It's ten feet radius, so you guys are going to have to get close to me. That's enough for all of us if we gather. Pike and Scanlan are in it, everyone else needs to get close. All right, yeah, I'll do like 20 feet, not my full 30 but enough to where people-- no, fuck it, I'll do 30 feet. We're running to the tree. So we can Transport Via Plants, was the thought. You got it, you got it! He's going to kill us, yeah. Is that a radius thing or just for yourself? That's awesome. Oh, Jesus Christ! Fuck! There's not a closer bush? Nothing closer we can jump in? They guy we missed because we laid low from him and he flew over and we were like 'don't move,' and we missed him? Where are we going, what are we doing? Do we want go back to the keep? What?! Grog! I cast Transport Via Plants on the fucking tree! I'm hoping it's the first, I'm hoping it's the first. What did we do? The whole city, everyone's dead. Holy fuck.
