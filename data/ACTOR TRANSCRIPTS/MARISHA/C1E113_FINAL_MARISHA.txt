We have the best fans. It's so good. Yeah, it seems like you've been so busy. You do retweet Cute Emergency quite a lot. Like, unfashionably late. Right before we sleep? Scanlan awkwardly put it in a weird druid circle rock thing, it's over there. He doesn't know how to do druid circles really right. (whispering) I don't think he's telling the truth. Enigmatic? What does he mean? Wait, cutting webs? He's vulnerable to-- oh, to-- Got it, I got what they got. Along with Delilah. That's fun. Hashtag blessed. I recently was able to attune to this armor that I haven't been able to attune to for a long time and now I'm resistant to spells. So that's good. Yes. Kind of. Well I had to attune to my ring and my antlers, and then I got the staff, so I let that go, but now I just wore it for long enough. I have four, because I took a feat when I leveled up. Yeah that's pretty dope. And I think it's smart if Pike and I dedicate a decent amount of our spell power to Freedom of Movement right before we go in. Pike is super strong, she's a monstah! Okay, so save that one for when he's real fucked up. Percy and I had a thought for Grog. If you borrow Percy's Spider-Climbing boots I can maybe make some pillars to add for cover for some of us more rangey people, but then if I add pillars of different heights you can climb up them. I mean I could Shapechange into something and give him a mount, he can ride me. I can cast in Beast Shape, Shapechange is a spell, so if I'm a dragon, beholder, that's what you get. Your dice tray dried nicely, though. Well I can do six of them, I can do a lot of pillars. I can cause up to six pillars, each pillar is a cylinder five feet wide and up to 30 feet high, and can do six of them. Well, he wasn't that much more than 30 feet last time. If I get Grog 30 feet up you still have your throwing axe, he's still reachable another 30 feet for you right? Theoretically. But it's something, if he's out of range. Do we remember how high the tower orby situation was, did we get a number for it? No, I mean, there was the dome above that. I mean there's that gemstone thing that he's using. That's right! And then we could bring in the forces. Help us! Help us J'mon, help us! Yeah I know, I remember. Polymorph, I don't know-- Then what the fuck does "permanent" mean? So they have to at least cast it at 9th-level, in order to dispel it. Wait, are you talking about Polymorph or True Polymorph right now? Because Polymorph only lasts for, like, an hour. What else you have? Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom food. Are you doing anything? With your thing, before we go to sleep? Hang on, I will say, a second Scanlan will immediately clue in Vecna that there's some trickery magic going on. Is there a way that second Scanlan can be, like, definitely hidden? So he can just be (snaps) support Scanlan? Counterspell Scanlan? Because he can also maybe just cast support stuff for us, right? And the only other thing would be, like, a second Pike to do all of the Freedom of Movement stuff, and things like that-- Those Counterspells, man-- Can second Scanlan be invisible second Scanlan? Okay, hang on, if someone has to roll to see if second Scanlan is dispelled, do you have to roll? Second Scanlan has to roll? Vecna has to roll. I can throw up pillars. Yeah. I think the pillars could be good for cover and other things. Because I'm assuming we're-- So can we decide that earlier? MATT and That's cool. I thought that's what we were doing! We tried. Wait, we definitely mentioned that! This is real fucked up. There's been a few times that we've all known we could die together, but this might actually be it. Yeah. It's fine. Yeah? Same. Aw, that's so cute; he's honest when he's asleep. I think it's like his focus, you know? Like, it's weird to say goodnight, right? Yeah! All right. Good night? All right. To Thar Amphala. On the back of a titan. On the Material Plane. Good luck! Oh, natural 19. 28. Yeah, what were you trying to do? I turn to Percy, and I go Who's fighting who?! 17. Uncomfortable elevator at a convention. Why did you wear wings? Oh, holy shit. Oh. It's been, like-- two years? (giggles) I know. I don't want to have to do anything. Arkhan. You look like you've, you know-- You look like us. You got more stuff. We've acquired more stuff, over the years. That's cool. Yeah, forever. Before we really knew any of you. It was a crappy swamp. It was good times. Yeah. It was a crappy desert. Good times. It was, yes. The driest of swamps, yeah. Sylas? Quick question. We didn't roll our temporary hit points for our Heroes' Feast. Can we do that? Or does Pike do that for us? For all of us, right? It's an additional 2d10, I'm pretty sure. Oh, I totally should've given a speech. No, it's a short rest thing. But it's a thing that lasts until-- Yeah. I should've done that before, but I'll do it next time. Two ones? And poison. Slim feast! Yeah, those crystals that we started to break when we were in the Shadowfell. Yeah! In fact, that's actually a brilliant plan. We could disable a crystal, maybe I could light a signal, distract people. While they're distracted, we make it to the next one. Yeah, in the Shadowfell. Remember, we jabbed at one, and decided against it. Everything. Let's move. 32. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You need to print one in black and white. (laughing) That's such an L.A. joke, yeah. All right, let's do it. You are fallible. I don't know. Do we keep going? Do we try to get down some more? Opal die, don't fuck me! 18. Move, move, move! Can you do the cool John Wayne thing, and go underneath of him, and hang on his belly from the saddle? 27. Maybe wait for them to land. SAM and So wait, is it Vorugal? Is it Thordak? It's your old mount? Bony dragon! Wait, did you put a cool little acrylic thing on there to make them mountable? That's pretty dope. I'll be downstairs. Is Keyleth up top? Keyleth's up top, okay. Don't fuck me, Gil! Right. No. Do you always do this or is this new for you? Yeah, you hear it? Six. Oh, hello! Is there gaff tape in the house? I know there's a row of it back there. Yeah, get that roll of gaffer tape. (mispronouncing) Brian Foster. What are we making? Dex saves? This doesn't give us spell resist, right? That's all right. That's good. 17. 49! Minus 49? I'm at 94. Don't look down. Never mind. I mean if it used to be yours-- I don't know. Sylas is up and moving? No! But it cancels out. That sucks. Between the Scanlans. Wait, Delilah or Sylas? Okay. Hey, Scanlan Two. Are you just as charismatic as Scanlan One? Okay, I don't care. Okay, Keyleth is going to try to do a one-two punch here. She's going to move forward and then does she see Delilah? Okay, I'm going to reach out and do an Entangle spell right under her. Unless she can make a strength save versus my spell shit. Fail, so she is restrained, and then I'm going to run, and I'm going to use my Mantle of the Tempest to jump, and then trying to be dope, here, in mid-air, I'm going to change into an earth elemental and try and grab onto the bone dragon and see if I can snap his neck in the process. Grapple the bone dragon's head. Yes, and then I'm running and jumping and grabbing for the rest of my movement. A straight athletics? Yeah. (whimpers) 11. Yeah. Fuck her shit up! Prone and grappled, and not for a very long time. Does he get entangled? Because he did just land in difficult terrain. He's in difficult terrain. I have rocky ground. That's all I have. 21 plus 14? Yeah. And you're raging right? Plus your rage damage, don't forget to double that. And is that doubled too? Okay. Come on, come on Grog! The difference. Yeah, I was wondering about that. Kill her, kill her. Get it girl! Get it girl! That's fine. Hell yeah. Kill him! Goddamn it, John. No! Vampire bullshit! I have a reaction! Can Keyleth the ellie try to grab it? Can I? Yes! Come on, yes! Snatch that bat! I'm nervous. Yeah, this is like what Dr. Seuss warns us about as kids. Oh my goodness! Matthew Mercer?! (laughter) Just the eyes cut out. Don't. Fuck. Me. Gil! It's fine. It kind of fucked me. 12. Jocks were not this polite in the locker room. I love your commitment to the tickle. If you guys let me go right now I can try-- You can do something? No! Let me go first! You can if other people hold. And you describe-- How far away is he? I'm going to drop my form, take my action to cast Earthbind on him, it's a 300-foot range spell. He did. Strength versus my spell save. 22?! You can't do anything? Can I do it again immediately? Can I try again? Yeah. I know! Can I wait and-- He rolled so fucking high! If you all hold, I can try again. Yeah, but it's a 300-foot range spell, and he's only 150 feet away. I don't think he can dash 150 feet. But it's a 300-foot range spell. Right. That's what I'm saying. We get back around everybody! Is he still fucking here?! Get him down! You guys aren't going to want to hear this, I can run forward and Sunburst him at 150 feet away but it's going to burn my 8th-level spell. I have Sunbeam, which is a 6th-level spell at 60-foot away. No, I dropped my form. Can I scoop up Vex and dash 60 feet ahead and Sunbeam him for another 60 feet? I'm green. Yeah, whose turn is it? And her holy symbol that fell to the ground. Is what? Inert? What a dick! We're giving away things. Yeah, actually, Max or Ryan, is there stipulations on the shirt? We'll figure it out! Last time, Pike and I took it down with a couple of Earthquake spells. I mean, we didn't have to go up the damn thing, so maybe check yourself before you say things. Are you going to do that $20 bill trick in New York City, thing? Wait, stealth? 29. Aldor? No, Aldor! No. We need a full 30 minutes to do a quick short rest? I'm at 94 hit points, I'm down about 50 or so hit points. I'm 50 points down, and I burned both of my shape change. Who else is down far? No, look, super short. I don't know! What do you want? I don't know, but we also, we broke down the barrier, so Vasselheim can defend itself a little more. I'm 50 points down and without my beast shape. I used it to go earth elemental, because I thought the Briarwood fight might be a little bit more beefy than it was. But I don't necessarily need it. To quote the leaders of Vasselheim, "They have defended themselves through many forms of battle." I'm not great. I'm at 94 hit points, so I'm down-- You guys don't want us losing any of our spellcasters right now. I'm at 94. It's not a lot, it's not bad, but it's bad enough. I'm a third of my hit points down. Yeah, but every time you heal me and heal me and heal me, it's taking away from something else mechanically. I'm resigning my decision right now. 16 points? I'll take that. 110, I'm still 31 hit points down. For me? I could do my speech if I had a short rest. 141, I'm full. Is this the verge? Because if this is the verge-- Like, an hour a while? Pike and I burn all of our 4th level spell splots to do-- Splots! Do all of our spell splots! To cast Freedom of Movement on anybody. With the exception of Percy, who already has it. Three each. Except, we didn't account for-- Or Arkhan. Oh my god. He has it automatically. No. I mean, I don't know-- Unless we want to try and get higher up before we go. Do we think this is it? Are we sure this is it? Okay, so this means, anything we encounter, if it's not fucking Vecna, then we're barreling through it and going straight up. Because we've burned everything. I don't know what's worth it. Do we have any idea of how much higher this tower goes? Do we want to try and jog another ten minutes before doing this? Okay, okay. Before we burn everything-- Okay, we're going to go ten more minutes up and I'm going to give a speech as we go. I say, okay, guys, as we climb this tower, I know there's a lot of stairs, but the stairs are going to be fucking nothing compared to Vecna. But holy fuck, these are a lot of fucking stairs. The stairs are a metaphor. Each stair that we get across is going to be like another step further into defeating Vecna. You know? With each stair-- I'm winded. The stairs are long, but they are not infinite. Be good and now we're almost there, guys! We're almost there! This is it! This is it. (sobbing and panting) This is it, you guys! Just keep going up the stairs! And that's my speech. 19 hit points. And they're temporary, not-- Do we heal above that? Right, so those 19 go first. Yeah, and Pike and I cast whenever seems appropriate. It gives you an additional 19 hit points. Temporary hit points. So add plus 19 on top. When you lose them, they're gone. Huh? Oh, I had to roll? Oh, everyone but for them! Dex save. 13. Can you Dimension Door? Not for any particular reason. We're holding on our Freedom of Movement, right? We decided that? Until we get higher? Oh no! Okay. I'm waiting for Pike. Freedom of Movement to Scanlan One, myself, Vax. That's all I've got. From Keyleth. That's actually a good idea. It's possible, but (uncertain noise)? Is what his face was? Right. Then Keyleth turns to Vax Whatever happens, lest it be trite, stay with us. Casts Guidance for the next minute, which gives you 1d4 on ability checks. Yeah, before we move. Just for the start of it. Can we stealth around them and not fight them at all? That's what I was looking for. Can Keyleth take a peek and see what's up? Yeah. Do you still have that? Dope. That's real good. 39. (inarticulate yelling) Okay. Does it look like the floor opens? It's worked stone. He doesn't know. Anything that can help us? We're in the tower of Entropis. We're on the back of a titan. Try to get them as far away from here as possible. Vasselheim is an hour away. No, we're in Thar Amphala. It's been teleported to the back of a titan, which is a giant mountain, which is what we're on. It's from the Shadowfell. You just have to get away! And you're going to go away. J'mon Sa Ord is here, the Slayer's Take has probably been vastly compromised. Just get out of here. Get to the woods. Scanlan's right. Then go! Go! I hate to say this but Arkhan do you have him? Let's go!
