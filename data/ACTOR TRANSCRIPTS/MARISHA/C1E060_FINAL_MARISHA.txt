I'm an independent woman, all right? And we got hacked, which means we made it. (whispers) Grog. (whispers) Your pants, they're sagging a little bit, why? (whispers) They're sagging. Where's Garmelie? I look regal and as we pass elves I say, good day. That's not normally what people tell me. That's right. What were the name of the guards in Emon? Did they have a name? Yeah, totally. Yeah, that's true, we never really see that! This is gorgeous. Look at the craftsmanship. It's incredible. Good day. Good day. Good day. They respond better if you say "good day" and if you have your head up. Bidet, yes. Good day. Maybe a chamomile, it would be great. Oh, here. I pull out some herbs that I brought from my garden. Some glisfoil and other things. They won't scream at you when you pick them. Good. It's good. Oh, I'm Keyleth of the Ashari. Good day. I think she means your name. But you can call him whatever's available, as well. We're trying to head to the Shademirk Bog. We're looking for the bow of Fenthras. It supposedly lives inside of a cancerous tree. It's like being on a ship forever. So you're trying to go after Thordak himself. That's your first target, Thordak? Also, it would be nice to find shelter for those of us who are not titled. No, not you. Good day. (laughter) Yeah, that one. And then we've also killed a white one. Brimscythe. That's the one. I pull out a dragon's tooth from Umbrasyl out of my pocket and I toss it to him. That's the result of the doings of your children. You should be very proud. Percy! No, don't die! I'm being blood out of your jugular, just go with it. Is that a swear word? I've never heard a soldier say, "Ah, blue sparkly poo!" I feel like she didn't get that from a soldier. Pretend. I'm pretend handing it off. If not, reach out to Allura of Emon. I had a feeling you did. (laughter) Does everything look like hitting on people to you, Scanlan? Take off the beer goggles, take them off! Those are plus-two magical beer goggles. Take them off! We're those terrible-influence side of the family, aren't we? It's the one Scanlan burned. But you have a title! We're respectable. I know! Are we all in rooms next to each other, are we in one room? Have they already locked us in our rooms? She was right behind us! So can we have like a little family pow-wow in maybe one of the rooms before we all tuck in for the night and you put the masking tape over each of our doors so we don't sneak into each other's rooms. High school field trip, yeah? And wine? Maybe some wine? I was wondering where my tea went. Garmelie... Can I try? Oh, I got a 17. I'm way more better than Scanlan. Natural insight. 28. I do a little entangling underneath of him and start checking his pockets, TSA style. Start giving him the frisk. Into the pockets. In his vest pockets. You little devil. Is this a pocket of holding? I think about the fancy silverware that I might've seen in Syldor's house. I think of fancy teacups, because he mentioned drinking tea. Goddamn it. I think of gold? Oh, I think of gold. Sorry, I'm not materialistic. I mean, I'm not. I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world. (laughter) Ow! That's true. I have them written down. (laughter) Of a threshold crest? Oh no! Right, in the other dimension that they came from. You realize Syngorn didn't originate here in the Feywild, right? Oh, lord have-- oh, sweet Sarenrae. Oh my god, she's got a pirate tri-corner hat? Oh my god, like Peter Pan! I have a vague idea of why you might want a piece of the threshold crest, but why would you want the High Warden's hat? They stole his Emmy? Because it ultimately doesn't matter. You know how awards work. Come on. Oh, hang on, before we all leave. Vex and Vax, what did your dad do back in the day? Because he knows Allura and he talked about knowing Thordak. Does he have any type of fighting capabilities? Because it sounds like he was a part of the mission to lock in Thordak 11 or so years ago. He mentioned that he's been down this road before. Well, if he sells politics, there could be a lot in selling war against a dragon. I'm not trying to be a dick, but your father was kind of a dick so I'm just questioning it. I'm not trying to talk shit about your family. Okay. I'm just saying. Thank you! I've been learning from you. I don't mean to question to him, he just said a few things that raised a few hairs on the back of my spine. About this time I use Alter Self to go a little half-Minxie and get those-- like when a dog is pissed off and it puffs up the hair, towards Grog. I do a little gust cantrip from behind the door to make her hair blow in the wind. (laughter) Aw, man. Aw, they're shedding on it! They're those little blue stones that are keeping the city here. Although Grog doesn't have the worst idea. And I don't mean smashing Vax's head. That's not what I mean. But don't we have some hidden gems, because I'm really terrified if we start hacking away at these stones what might happen. So maybe we can do something kind of fakey. Is he asleep? He's asleep, right? That's an Emon tradition. We're overseas, remember. I turn into Minxie and resign to the idea that I'm going to be sleeping with Garmelie and Trinket and just cuddle next to them in Minxie mode. Oh, we're not sleeping? I'll come on. Am I going to freak people out if I walk around like this? I drop Minxie form, because that seems very aggressive. Can we have your hat? She might know about Fenthras and the bow. What if she's wearing the hat? What if the hat is on her head? Good day. Are there chairs for all of us? Shadowmurk Bog. That's the one. Shademirk. That's it. I thought it was blue. Might be green. Yeah, you didn't sleep, Scanlan! So there's no real easy way into the bog, is what you're saying? Got it. Oh my god, they're so cute, though. They're amazing shoes. I didn't notice them until you pointed them out, sorry. No, continue on. Oh, wait, wait, lady! High Warden. I'm sorry. I was just curious. It's my first time to Syngorn, and it's in the Feywild. It's special, right? Is there a gift shop? A visiting the temple and sights of Syngorn type of shop? Right! Oh, thank you! Do you get the monthly newsletter? Oh my god, Vex, are you okay? Oh no, what? Keyleth turns to the guard. (laughter) You will get a letter from me, good sir. You will get a letter, okay? Your five-star review just went to a four, okay? I just want to say. What? If you took us to the gift shop, it might fix things. Okay? I start pretending like I'm doing a Cure Wounds spell to her wrist, you know? Wait, you're taking us to the lost and found? Please! This is the high baroness Lady Vex'ahlia! Can I ask a logistical question? Is Garmelie with us or did we leave him behind? What? Grog. Wait, is this an investigation? Natural one. Keyleth starts talking up Braum. Braum? Braum. So, Braum. Where're you from? Oh, it's all for-- really, oh. You didn't see any distraction. You didn't see anything. Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah. Your four-star rating just went down to a three. And I'll also pick something random out of spite. I'll take this. I like it. I chose it on purpose. That's awesome. And did you say I had a half a tobacco box? Or no, just a tobacco box? An old tobacco box. All right. Yeah, sure. Keyleth takes the potato. Okay, give it to me, give it to me. Okay, wait, do we find any pictures of threshold crests? Or a postcard? We'll just go. Good day. I think Percy and I can fake them out. Wait, is he around? Don't say it out loud. How long have we been awake at this point? But they said they got these stones from the other side, from our realm. I've got plenty of energy. I'm-- MARISHA and So tired. Right? So wait, are we all in our own individual rooms? We can go into our own rooms and I can fix it if we don't want to tip people off. It's for prayer. We have to pray. Remember, right, Grog? Keyleth says, we're totally polyamorous-- And I turn Percy and Vax into squirrels with Polymorph. See? Polyamorous. Okay, I drop Polymorph. That's what polyamorous means, right, guys? Okay. And looks like a crest. And I start casting Stone Shape right under the threshold of the door to the room that we're in, and I cut out a crest from the threshold. A Whitestone crest. From the threshold of the door. There's a piece of your threshold crest. (laughing and cheering) Let's go. Follow the finger. My hair is messed up. And I transform into a goose and come out as a goose. Always duskward. She's not wrong. Well, you're not entirely wrong, I don't know if I can Teleport via Plants because generally that takes knowing the plant. However, I do have Tree Stride, which means we can-- nope, never mind, I can only do that on myself. But I'm loosey! I'm a loosey goose. We can mist there. I might have to take a hot nap. Yeah. Yeah. The answer is yes. I can do all those things. If we can get to the edge of the bog, then we'll take a sleep. We'll go until we're tired. Robert Durst shit. Don't touch the grass, it'll get angry at you! It'll yell at you for a week! What? I was just trying to protect him. Don't! Does the grass seem angry? Suck it, grass! Because you... suck out the joy of all of us living around you, and you're so amazing. I mean, you suck out bad-- I feel like the grass feels our emotions. I do an interpretive dance. -- to avoid the Green Sea. How long have we been awake? If we want to mist there, then we have to sleep. But we'll press on for a few more hours. Question. You mentioned we are going into the Moonbrush with lycan hunters? Yeah, no, it sounds like it. Yeah. What? Ukurat. Did we-- okay, yeah. Sure. Yeah. Someone's got a really good one. Can I do a nature check on one of the bones to see if I can identify where it came from? Yeah, the closest bone, I don't want to, ooh. Yeah. No, it's not. 28. I step back with the bone. Can I lean the bone over to Vex'ahlia and be like, is this Draconic? God fucking damn it. Wait, did we get cut off? Did Vex and I get cut off from everybody else? I hold on for dear fucking life. Hi! Like I taught you! I've got an old tobacco box I got from lost and found. What? I turn into a giant scorpion. You want an offering, you can have mine. Oh god. 21. Thank you!
