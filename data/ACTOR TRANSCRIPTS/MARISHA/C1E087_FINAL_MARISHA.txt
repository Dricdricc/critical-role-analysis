It's true. Don't use that one, either, in real life. And then we hand it off to someone awesome. Because you can only learn so much from one teacher. The best teachers will teach you that. Shut. Up. This is the real world, okay? This isn't fantasy. Mm-hm. That's true. (groan) It was so good. Cheez Its? (singing) Don't call it a comeback! (singing) Don't you ever forget! (all laugh) I'll catch up on some reading, I guess. Some of my alchemy reading. From I've been doing, trying to make that better. Ooh. Are-- you're not... I go up to the deckhands who are manning the sails. Hi, heard it was full sail, full-- Do you need help with anything? To do-- you need-- I can make, like, wind. And we can maybe get there faster. Oh, okay. 'Cause I can-- You're doing great. Good work. I shout out to Percy, what are you guys looking for? Everyone's so excited! This is so exciting. I was-- because we're on the high seas, and that's what sailors do. Yeah! See, we're sailors, now! Yeah. Captain. I was-- I'm not talking to you, anymore, Percy. Captain. Would you like more speed behind those sails? Okay! And then I go back and I start doing Gusts into the sails. Well, it's a cantrip, or I could do a level three Gust of Wind. Sorry, level two Gust of Wind. Level two, level two. Gust of Wind. Okay. Captain. Hey, look! I've got rubber booties! (laughs) Aren't I cool, Tary? Ahoy! This is an equal opportunity ship. Grog, what did you do? Ugh. I kinda do a quick, like, Druidcraft gust and dry him off a little bit. No! Who sees it? Oh, everybody does now. Can I do a nature check to see if it looks like natural ocean fog? That's not great. 14. Does this look like something that I would have? Like, is this another druid doing a fog cloud spell? Bigger than us? Than my spell. Bigger than my spell? Yeah. Well, I-- Wait, wait, wait, this-- Can you do any flourishes? Can you do any like tosses? Like color guard? Oh, damn. All right. Sorry, Captain? How close are we to our destination? This could be Vesrah. Really? Does this look to be island-sized? So it's coming towards us? I do another Gust of Wind and clear the ship deck and clear the path ahead of us. I'm going to see if I can see what this is from underneath the water. I'll be back. And I swan-dive off of the edge and into the water. Yeah, bye. I'll be back. Bye! I'm going to do Alter Self to give myself little gills and little fin hands and go with the ship. Oh! What's up, Tary? Don't fuck me, Gil. It was cocked. It was right on a 20, which sucks. That's all right, perception check, 24. But nothing under the surface? Nothing breaking the surface tension of the water? It looks smooth. It looks man-made? It's invisible. Okay, I come up out of the water and I use my earring to communicate that to everyone else. It's, you know-- I don't know, do I? Can I communicate? I can still talk. Yeah I come out of the water and communicate it. A little bit like Linda Blair. I'm going to swim closer to where the chains are coming from and swim closer to the invisi-ship. I'm going to come up-- oh, go ahead. I'm going to come up and, in the path as the ship is going by, can I do a poof of Faerie Fire in front of it? To see if I can Faerie Fire the ship? It's not going to do it. Okay, then I'm going to see if I can-- can I try and grab onto the side of the ship? The seams? Natural one. That shit hurts. Do I see Tary? Yes! Once I track down the ship. I kind of swim up and I say, Tary can you catch-- this might be bad. Do I see any type of-- what are they called? Cleats. The ship cleats. Do I see anything like ship cleats? Right? Like the little things, the prongs. Do I see anything like that? I want to try and do a-- like a grasp-- like Thorn Whip myself to the ship. Well, that's not great. Just straight athletics? Athletics is pretty good! 15! Yeah! 30-foot range. Tary! Tary! Tary! I want to apologize right now. Because in this moment, I am a damsel and I am in distress! (all laugh) You were. Today, in this moment, for this 30 seconds of time-- --you were a hero. Thanks. Okay. I give a heads up. Heads up, heads up, people. Incoming forces, coming your way! Fuck. I hope these aren't my-- --these aren't, like, my people, right? I haven't found out who they are. No! Yay, it's a boat! These are probably the Water Ashari, aren't they? Twins. Oh. 11. Sorry. Oh shit. Water elementals. It probably is. Just haven't figured that out yet. Well, that's pretty cool. The water elemental. Big money, no whammies! That's good. (yelps) (Wilhelm screams) (singing) I got a nautical themed, pashmina Afghan. That's what she said? No. Oh. My god. Drop the chain they're holding on to? They might be. We'll figure that out. My cousins might be fish men. They could be anybody. They could be werefish. It's not me, Grog. It's not me. Can I say something to him? Hi! Kaitiyaki. Water Ashari? Hm. Hm. Cousins? No? Oh. Nope, that misses. Yeah. Okay. That's-- yeah. Jeez Louise. Okay. Am I still on the side of the boat? I'm gonna climb up that boat. Ooh, that's good, 17 plus my athletics, which is good, which is seven, so 24. Miss. No. Hit. Sorry. Okay. Any sign that these could still be my people? Pretty certain they're not. Nothing? Guys, real pirates! And then I'm going to do Control Water. And I'm going to raise water 20 feet around me, and start sinking this bitch. I want to sink this ship. 20 feet, just tidal waves coming over the boat, and I'm sinking it. Fourth level. Nope. I'm sinking it. Do I have any movement, or is that it? Probably getting up is my movement. Okay. Cool. I maintain concentration. Cool. It's what I like to hear in life, in general. No, it's localized. Eh. We've got time. Destroy reality? Adele Dazeem. Boat shoes on! Taryon! LED six! LED. Six. Aw. I feel like 'shank shank' is less attractive on a t-shirt. (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty. (electric guitar sounds) (gasps) This hasn't happened in like 20 games. Oh my god. You going to kill two birds with one stone? Errol Flynn this shit, is that what you said? Oh man, now you're in an Angelina Jolie movie. What if one day you died because of that? I'm sorry, your best friend? What the fuck? That's not as good. C'mon, Adele Dazeem. We've got these shitty nicknames for everyone. Oh, shit. We're still attached to this boat, right? I am. How much slack do we have before I start pulling our boat underwater, because I don't want to be that-- kinda thought someone would start-- I wanna keep doing this. Can I concentrate my flooding of water so-- there's now a hole in the side of the ship, under where Tary was, right? I had to think not to say Scanlan. I wanna flood in more water. Can I flood it more on this side, to where I try and-- or can I do something fancy, like a giant hand of the gods from the wave come up and-- -- take the fish-head guy? Or can I at least try and flood that side to where I can try and toss him over? Let me see if I can Control Water and take a wave to toss him overboard. He is a fish. He is very definitely a fish. Oh, right. You know, I'll just keep sinking this ship. I'm gonna keep concentrating. I can't do that right now. You're good, right, Tary? All right. Good! This is like a Tuesday for us. Six, you need six? Are there still bad guys left? But nothing left on the ship, right? That we see? Bye! He got his $50,000 worth. What? Why would you think he's a demon? You have a d3? It's a d6 cut in half. See a guy get thrashed. 1d4 plus four... 1d6 lightning damage per charge expended. That's good. Lightning's bad for water. Not that I'd know. Yeah, I do. Five more, of course. Dream come true, make it happen. Is that everyone done? Take it with us, take it with us. That's sad. Yeah, you never know. Getting old, man. I shout to-- Sorry. That was cool! I say Hey guys! Cruises are really trashy! (laughs) And I still have Control Water going. Can I flush out the bottom of the cruise ship and bring whatever treasure is up out of the bow with what water is there? Just kind of (whoof)? Okay, I stop sinking the boat. Because we're not dying. I bring the water up like a fountain of wealth and youth. Just coming up. Out of the bottom. (all laugh) Just other way. Seeing what comes out from the bottom of the ship. Hopefully not dead bodies or like-- Slave trade or something sad-- yeah, like slave. Oh, come on! He's looking at his notes like it's a thing! That's my worst nightmare! Oh! Watch your head! Points! Aw. These were lame pirates! No treasure. Lame! (all laugh) I said I balanced it out and that I'm kind of doing that. We also kinda put a bunch of holes into the side of it. So I can only do so much. I try to balance it as much as I can. Yeah. Put it in the Bag of Holding, Grog. Please tell me I didn't kill someone innocent again. Hopefully no innocent people. And I'm just trying to visualize with the last ten minutes that I have of Control Water to clear the bottom of this passage. The rushing-in, that's what I want to do. I wanna part right where Percy's heading. Sorry, physics. What, me too? Jesus F. Christ. Oh, that's not too bad. Just straight dex saving throw. Plus five. What did I roll? 16. Quick, quick, quick! Aw, you rolled a 19! Come on. Come on, Percy. Come on. What? Are you going? I'm gonna try whatever last bit of Control Water I have to try and part and calm the waters where Vax is going, and I say, go Vax, go! I'm trying to calm the water as much as I can. Go, go, go! And I'm just holding concentration, hoping someone catches me. That's good, that's good. Yeah! I drop Control Water, switch back to my Alter Self, grab Percy, head back to the boat. A fight at sea! Like Battleship, but better. Yeah, the prisoner. Yeah. Let's bring 'em back. We wanna talk to him. Do I have any residual Control Water left? Yeah? Can I see if I can pull any water out of his lungs? That's good! Just straight wisdom? Straight wisdom? 21. Just straight wisdom? Yeah. Vax. Help. No shit. Sorry. Oh shit. Oh, I don't wanna fight Hotis on the ocean. What you got? What do you got, Grog? Tempest Fang-- where do you hail from? Keyleth, of the Air Ashari. From around? Not the sailor type, then? What were you doing on the Ozmit Sea? From Emon to where? Oh, from Issylra. All the whispers. Yeah! Get it, Levi's, yeah. Yes. Have you sailed frequently before? What was your exact duty on this ship? Oh. Right. He already said that. So, you sail a lot. Yeah. That's true. That's all true. Yeah. We've seen a lot. Do you have The Dog with you? Oh. Honestly, this is how we treat people we like. Yeah. All right. So we've cleared a few things, right? You seem untrustworthy, and broken, so therefore we like you. What else can we learn about you? And you're sure they were just pirates, yeah? I don't know. I've never met a real pirate until just now. Wait, one of the crewmen? One of ours? Why is he acting like he's starving? Oh, him, not our crewmate. Oh, sorry. Sorry, we were confused. Sorry. I brought you biscuits! (eating sounds) Do you want these? So, you said you travel the Ozmit Sea frequently, yeah? Have you stumbled upon the island of the Vesrah? The Ashari people of this ocean? Of the Ashari (laughs). Of Omand? Alland? Almond? Almond Joy. The Island-- A-N-A-M-N. Anman. An-amn. And I light up my fire hands. Bye. So, wait. If he works for one of 18 companies of the archipelago, that means the archipelago has pirates-- 17 other pirate ships? Wait, did we just sink one of the other 17 companies of the archipelago? Yes, I'm a natural caster. You're the only arcane caster. You should. All the papers. All the papers in the world. You just do it, it just takes time. Could you do that? In Doodie? It's seven-inch-- Can I do a nature check on it? On the orb? Did it come from any Water Ashari, or anything like that? (all laugh) 14? That's awesome. That's cool. (laughs) Outlook cloudy. Floodlight. I was gonna say, like an old-school lighthouse. I spend my evening reconnecting with Vax. I don't want to say I feel like I'm being replaced. You know? It's not that. It's just that Percy's kinda found a new friend. No, it's not that. I'm a good friend, right? I mean, I know I can't-- I can't fulfill every need. I will never know what the metric system means. I don't know what that is. I'm still a good friend, right? I'm still a good friend? Am I a good friend? All right. Okay. No, I know. I know I told them to like, bond but now-- I mean (sighs). No, it's fine, it's fine. I'm cool. I'm cool. I've missed you. Hi. (crying sounds) (all laugh) (tearfully) New guy and the new guy dynamic! And I don't know what the new guy's chemistry's like! (tearfully) That's true. (tearfully) I'm glad the new guy's the worst of our problems. (all laugh) (tearfully) I just love Percy so much. (sobs) Man, you're going for it. (all laugh) (laughs) I'm restless in all of my night's sleep as we get closer. (groans) I rush to the bow of the ship. No, this is fantastic. And I run to the edge of the ship and I shoot a Daylight into the spell and throw a Create Water and make a rainbow over top of us. (tch boom) Ooh. I run past all of them and just jump into the water, not gracefully like before and start swimming. Perception check? Fine. Ooh! Oh that's just a dexterity check? Oh, perception. 28. (nervous sounds) I just start-- Using my cantrips-- (laughing) A boat for Doty. As far as it goes, yeah. Kaitiaki. And I drop to my knees and drop down and-- Gah! (heavy breathing) And bow again. Sorry, are you the leader-- are you the headmaster? Oh! Hi. Uh, Keyleth. Yulan! I am Keyleth, daughter of Vilya and Korren of the Air Ashari, and I am here to complete my Aramente. And I bow again, under the water. (gasps) (gasp) It's just such an honor. What? Cooler. Cooler. (blows) And I let a little frost go from my breath. -- feet. I know, right? LIAM and As he's dragging me, I just start, like, rambling all the questions at once. I'm like, Aren't-- This is such a gorgeous city you have. Are you freshwater or saltwater? Do you have webbed feet? Does everyone have webbed feet? How many people can control water? Wow, look at that. Look at those. Is this fire that you use? Or is it all arcane? (gasps) Rad! Hi. (clears throat) Kaitiaki, I am Keyleth, daughter of Vilya and Korren of the Air Ashari, and I am here to complete my Aramente. I am-- Kaitiaki. I am honored to be in your presence. You knew my mother? I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm-- sorry, that just means she visited the Earth, and the Fire, and the Water Ashari. She completed her Aramente. What hap-- She-- I-- Everywhere I've been, she's been. Why not? I know. I mean, I've made it this far. In my heart, I feel like I'm almost complete, but I feel like you're about to tell me something different. Why? What's it called? (yells) So-- So, don't kill it? Don't kill the kraken. Right? Don't kill the kraken? Get three lodestones, bring it back, don't kill him because he is responsible for you guys not sinking into the ocean. He makes the lodestones-- -- with his droppings? All right. All right. So he drops these lodestones at the base of the water plane. Do you have an example of these lodestones so that we know what we're looking for? All right. So this starts in the morn-- Which is exactly what you said. You totally said that, didn't you? All right. I can handle that. I can handle that. So. What happened to my mother? Did she not make it out? Of the water plane? She's still alive. That means she's still alive. I will hold on to it, but I hope you know that does not define me. I'm not her. We'll complete your task. Thank you. Kill a kraken! Right, we're not gonna kill a kraken. We are going to not kill it. We're gonna collect kraken droppings. We're gonna bring a bottle of Kraken. Oh, I'm so gonna bring a bottle of Kraken next game! We're not gonna finish it. That's game, we do not finish it. Except for like one-fourth of it. We let it live. That's what I'm most afraid of! I've already thought about it. That she's the full Long John Silver. And a peg leg! She totally has a peg leg. (gasps) My mom's a pirate! (joins singing) And, as always, don't forget to watch Talks Machina on Tuesday-- With Brian Foster! At 7pm. What are you talking about, guys? This is fine. This is great!
