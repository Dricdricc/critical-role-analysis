I feel like it's if Nott was going for a Bowie vibe. Yay! No. That is incorrect. That is a spoiler, like a week ahead. Yes. Deep in the single digits. 22. SAM and These are lizard people? Or these are snake people? These are the yuan-ti. Do they look super pissed off? Okay. That's all I need to know. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to get up. Okay. I'm going to go for that hooded one if I can. I've got 25. Do I round down, because it's 45 halved? So 20 "foint?" 20 "foint" of "movemoint." Okay, so I'll just go for these two right there in the corner. I say We come in peace-- I can't even. Then I throw a punch. I'm going to see if I can hit the one to my right first. That was almost great. 12. Nope, 15. I'm going to punch with my fist. Which is good. Nine. I'm going to spend a ki point to stun. Stunning strike. Bullshit! I will punch the other one. Sorry, 13. Eight points of damage. I'm going to spend a ki point again and do flurry of blows. Then I'm going to punch each one of them again. TRAVIS and That was almost a natural 20. Did you see that? 15. That's good. Ten. Oh, thank you. I don't remember where these came from. Probably should have done Patient Defense, but I'm done. 18. There's not chairs. What? Mom's really expensive makeup. Uh-huh. He knew. He didn't have to ask. Your DM and your doctor. "That's not good." I should have. I made a wrong call. Okay. I'm still alive. Double, but barely. Did we ever do any of that poison resist stuff? We fell down the stairs, right? Mom's Jamedi. Okay. Uh-huh! That's good! Yeah. I'll take it. I'm going to turn around to Cobra Kai. I want to be like (slurring) That was mean. Because I'm still very sick and now I'm poisoned. Then I'm just going to start fucking blind rage, in my slight hallucinatory haze, whaling on her. Her. He. Monster. That first one was 21. Beautiful. Okay, that's eight damage, and I want to try Stunning Strike. Stunning Strike. 14. Okay. Hit it again. That was such bullshit. 11. I just look at it and I just go I don't feel very good. Then I'm going to do Patient Defense. I'm a little nauseous. (cheering) Sorry. I look at Yasha and I just go That was very (vomiting) and I puke a little bit on her. While all this is happening, I'm going to go over to one of those moss clusters and just cuddle up with it and sleep. And take a short rest. I don't know. While you guys are doing this I'm going to be like Guys, they have pillows. Oh! Yeah. You hear me in the corner go, hoo. Hoo. Does it echo? Yeah, hoo! I found a sing-songy tube. Yeah, most of them. I have 20 hit points total right now. Am I resting long enough where I can put on a few hit points? Let's take a short rest, for sure, that's what that means. How much time do we have left? I spent four hit dice, I'm up to 42 points. Does my malaria that I've come down with change? Hey, Cad, you know ghosts, right? Deep down inside, don't ghosts get mad when you build temples on top of their temples? Like graves on top of graves. Doesn't that make--? My parents fucking lied to me. (trilling) I'm still echoing. Oh. It's a time release capsule. I take it with booze. I'll search for a keyhole while we're at it. Maybe it's a skeleton key. Maybe the snakes come from the blood sacrifice. That's kind of what I said. Iron-y! He's looking! He's finger flipping! Uh-huh. I jump down. 14. It's pretty high, considering. Oh shit. Does this seem to be a lot of fruit? Yeah. Yeah, with blood. Definitely with blood. Well, judging by Nott's reaction right now, and we've already seen that these people hunt, so clearly this fruit isn't their main food supply. I'm assuming it's for rituals. Ten. A tablet? A door? I grab Nott and say Can I pick you up? Pick Nott up, walk Nott over to one of the tablets. We'll say the north wall and I face Nott towards the tablet and I say What do you see? You can see glowing symbols? Sorry, you didn't tell me that. What do you see? Holy shit. But I can't see glowing symbols? Yeah. I walk Nott over to the western wall. What is it? I take Nott over to the southern wall. Draw! Draw, Nott, draw! I went northern, western, southern. That is right, right? I help it down a little bit more. No, no, not you. "So it's one of these ways." Is that south? You better be writing this shit down. West. The garden feeds the warden? East, south, west, east. What? Why's she looking at you like you know what she's talking about? What? I wish to know what Avantika just fucking said. We're close? I'll do something and I'll say Caduceus, can you talk to them? You're always so convincing except for now! I pummel on the ones-- Jester saved Nott? Or is Nott still-- Can I wedge my hand in there to try and give a little bit of breathing room for Nott as I punch the vine? I'll attempt to help Nott escape. It might be a terrible mistake. Okay. (singing) Don't fuck me, Gil. Fuck me. Almost every time. Nine! It's a Green Day cover band. Okay. Shit. We didn't roll initiative. Nott's still stuck? Yeah, I'm going to take my staff and where Jester already put in holes, I'm going to (grunting). Nott. Nott? Nott! I didn't know about the one after Jester. I'm sorry. Okay. The first one is 22. Oh it's staff. Staff magic. Ten! Second attack. Not as good. 12. And bonus attack. Bad. Bad-ish. 13. Eight damage. Me? Because I'm attacking? Okay. 14. Fuck! Oh my god! Ooh! Return of the fucking unicorns! Yay! Nine! Just raving. Aww. Double d4! Oh yeah, kind of. This was me at the live show. Yeah yeah yeah! Yasha, you're just so flirty today. I run over and I pick up Nott and I-- (vocalizing intro to The Lion King) We should move. Yeah, that one says-- There's a hole in the bucket. How big are the gaps? Yeah, because north was-- The warden. Okay, but hang on. Do we want to go in, like, order, and start with the fountain feeds the garden? Sorry, sorry, sorry, "the sacrifice feeds the fountain" at east. Oh. What about -- Yeah, south. "Fountain feeds the garden." I assume you're telling us all this, yeah? Is this-- "The fountain feeds the garden." Maybe this isn't the garden that they were talking about. Seems like a pretty important entrance. I don't know why that would be last on their list. Do the tablets look to be on any hinges or levers? Okay. That's a natural one. Did you say moving? I do the same. Did you find anything? Where's the dead body? Anything good? I mean, we're not on the ship right now, though. Right? Hard to captain the ship when you're a hundred feet underground. Why are you looking at me? Is she invisible? Oh, okay. Okay. No. That's-- ugh. Tracy is my middle name. And I walk downstairs. Which gives me plus-- advantage? I will take it. 17. I just peek around the corner with my goggles on to see if I see anything. What's that there? There's a different wallpiece! I communicate all of that to everybody. Caduceus, you were talking about some-- (whispering) You were talking about some poison resistance. One? All I have are these. Thank you. I also communicate-- Thank you. I also said He has a shield and a scimitar. I don't know if we can get the shield away from him, but it'll make him easier to hit. It almost is like he's meditating, like I did that one time. Yeah. He's looking into the water, which makes me nervous about the water, because what could come out of it? Can we get the shield away from him? Can you pitch it to us in 30 seconds or less? Do you have a one sheet? Starting to get a picture, yeah. If you miss though, the ground is covered in water, so the powder will get really wet. She can potentially get a good-- Okay. That's not how darkness works! I'm into that, and someone should look at the dodecahedron. Oh, you got it? Okay. Sure, yeah. No button? Button! I guess me. Me and Fjord. Come on! Big money, no whammies. I like it! I know, yeah, I'm into it! That's. Fucking. Awesome. Yeah. Hang on. Okay-- nope. 19. (distressed humming) Fuck. Can I make it to the thing? Can I make it to him? I'm a monk. I've got fists! That's all I've got. How far can I make it? Uh-huh. Can I come here? Kind of behind? And-- oops! And throw a couple of shurikens? That's exactly my range. This is just plus my dex, right? Do I get my attack bonus? Okay, okay, okay. 18 for the first one. Ooh, that's better. That's a natural 13. Okay. They're d4's, right? Two d4's? The long debate of what's a monk weapon-- so five plus (counting)-- It's the darts. We've gone back and forth about this. The debate rages on. Sorry. Five plus four which is nine plus another four which is 13? Right? Yeah, 13 damage total. Then I'm going to-- Do I want to do Patient Defense? I'll do that. And hold-- I still have a bonus action though, right? Nah, you know, I'm not going to do that. I'll throw one more. Right? I can do that? Then I'll-- No, that's probably right. What? It should be right there. No, that's the Monster Manual, DM's guide. It's fine. I'll just hold for now. I'll just hold. Hell yeah. Yeah. Oh shit, fast. Super fast. Okay. A hydra! Who's the False Serpent? If the Warden guards the False Serpent? Fuck! Okay. To Beau? (yelling) I'm going to attack it! With my fists! Holy shit! Actually, can I go around? Can I flank with Avantika? Or no? No, you got to be in the water. Why are you putting a thing on me? LIAM and Oh, it's a good thing! Yeah, that's good. I'm going to come in and I'm going to do a big spinning barrel flip with two flying kicks! Crack, crack! Right onto its spinal cord. Sorry, Gil, you've been destroying me here lately. First two hits! Oh! Did you see that?! That was such shit! 14 for one. No, they both miss. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do more attack because of Haste! (groans) I'm not going to get out of there! I'm going to stay there! You're right, I'm going to back up and be like, this sucks! Can I disengage as a bonus with Haste? If I leave, I'm going to get hit. I'm going to take a bonus action to Patient Defense. I'm going to try and tank this. I could have left. Kill it! Jesus! Oh no! Step of the Wind. I could have disengaged as a bonus action, but I want to stay. It does, yeah, it does. But I'm going to stay. I don't want to do that, I want to stay and tank. Wait, the hydra? Or the thing? At disadvantage. Miss! With Bane? (coughing) Hits. Ooh! You're right, my AC is two higher, what did you say? Oh, 21? 21 is the AC. Shoot, the Captain. Okay, I want to parkour off of this pillar that I'm next to, and come down with a giant Superman pop! Just go for him. Two attacks. First attack, I'll take that 13 and 14, plus seven so 19-- or, 20 and 21, you're right. With my first one I want to do a stunning strike to it. No-- yeah. First attack, stunning strike. Oh my god, please. Nope! No, he saves. Plus five on his con? That's great to know. Okay, okay, okay. It's not a crit. That's definitely worse. With those two hits, I want to do extract aspects. I already know its con is plus five. Yeah, you did, thank you for the DM slip. What's its wisdom saving throw? Wisdom save is plus zero. He's not smart! Or wise, whatever. And if he has any-- do we want vulnerabilities or resistances?! LAURA and Vulnerabilities! What's his vulnerabilities? Not vulnerable to shit! Then, I have one more attack because of haste. Attacking again. That's a natural 16, pretty sure that hits. I'm going to use my staff. That's terrible. Six. I'm going to spend another ki point and do flurry of blows and do two more hits. One's an eight, so 15 for one. Then the other is an 11. Terrible again. Six points of damage. I communicate His wisdom save sucks, it's a plus zero. His constitution is a plus five. No vulnerabilities. No, I'm not moving. Hang on, wait. What's it doing? I was about to pee, but not-- did it move? Cool, cool, cool. Nope, not this round. Miss. He's shooting at me? 23? I'm going to use deflect missiles and take that-- minus d10 to-- All of it's negated by deflect missiles. I'm resistant to. Okay. I will go ahead-- My deflect-- I guess not, it's poison, it's not going to-- I'll still take that-- I'm going to-- I'm going to not spend the ki point. I look at him and I take the arrow and go-- No! Resistance! (spitting) No! With a wisdom save? Okay, okay, okay. Cauterized all of the head wounds. To him? Oh. From Yasha, yeah, if it's attacking something else other than her. It's a reaction. 18? I'll let you know. Not great. Double digits, but barely, once again. It's a hydra! It's Greek mythology! Wait, with Bane? Okay! Oh god. I see it grow more heads and I'm like Cool, cool, cool. I'm going to reach up and I'm going to bash two of its heads together! Then do a little bit of speed bag action! First attack. Yep, that's good. 21! I'm going to use my staff for this main hand. That's-- cool. Five damage. Next attack terrible. 12. That's my two attacks. Patient Defense. Terrible round. Done for me. Yeah, slow-mo style. Fwoom. Ting. Yeah. Ooh. Got a nice Erika Ishii zig-zag pattern now in my undercut. Nein. What was Matt going to say? I think you choose it, but it's a radius effect. It still rolled a natural 20, though. Sucks when your high level spells fail. I'm not feeling great, but if you-- You do you, man. He has plus zero to his wisdom saves. I don't know about the other guy. Shit! (weakly) I'll take it. I'll so fucking take it. Oh, does it? Cool, cool, cool. Uh-huh. (strained) Miss! No, I got bracers and I'm just fast as fuck. Yeah, that one hits. To me? Yeah? Okay. Yeah. Unconscious! Who me? Fuck. Lucky jade. Failure. Listen to Jester! Save me. Come on. I live another day! Yeah, the hooligan. No, you did so much already! So much! (farts) Sorry. I'd blame it on the chair if it wasn't trite. Oh! Technically, no! Plus five to con, plus zero to wis. I'm awake. Wait, isn't that her second how do you want to do this tonight? That was pretty good. Cool. Thanks. I had questions. Fuck! Oh shit. Yeah, I don't know. I would have lived.
