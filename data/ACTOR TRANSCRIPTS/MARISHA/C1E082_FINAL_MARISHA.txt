So many owlbears! Aww. Yeah, it's by the lake, too, you got that lake-effect air. Can she do that? Okay. I was just like, is that allowed? All right. All right. Proper handling techniques. Gimme those, gimme those, gimme those boots. Also, these boots may be good for our wonderful cleric. These are Boots of Elvenkind. While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on dexterity stealth checks that rely on moving silently. Sprinter's Boots are pretty clutch for Pike. Well, then, how's your stealth, Percy? Oh, you have spider-boots. What about you, Grog? Yeah, my stealth is pretty all right. I'm gonna do my circlet, my antlers, as always, Ring of Protection, Spire of Conflux. Is it an attunement thing? Do you have an extra spot, Kerr? To attune? Grog? Grog, how many fingers am I holding up? This is the Deck of Many Things? So -2 to all of his saving throws? Permanently? Pike is just universally cute. She's like a kigurumi, if you wear it, you're just automatically cute. Grog, if you want, also, you can have my Ring of Protection, which is a Ring of Protection +2, and it gives you +2 to AC and to all your saving throws. I was gonna wear it, but I could wear the Cloak of Displacement instead. Yeah. Okay. You're welcome. It's a little bit of a girly ring, so I understand. Well, you're full on attunements, right? You're full up? Yeah, would the cloak work with armor, right? It wouldn't replace his armor, a cloak? Are you okay with that, Vax? Kerr, we have this Cloak of Displacement that's pretty awesome, if you want to wear it. Okay. I take the cloak and I throw it over him. You gonna tweet it to him? Or text it to him? Whatever. Do you have a picture of the ring? Do you have a thing? No? Yes, we should. Pike, how are you looking on Feasts? Can Gilmore? And I'm assuming Trinket is eating and Allura is eating? Should I do a Scrying Eye, see if I can still find Raishan? Can I? We don't. If I scry on her cave, would that tip her off? The cave of Opash? Only one way to find out? I mean, I can always teleport us there and scry there. That way, at least-- minutes. That's a massive thing to consider. I think we should, too. I know. We need to get him another salt lick. Grog, that's caca! Putting rocks in the Bag of Holding. Just filling it with rocks. Ox, oxen, troll dicks, pet rocks, just a bunch of pet rocks. Does she look badass? In her full sorceress armor? Paint a picture. What's she look like? (laughter) What power-- how much energy do you use when you teleport? Mm. Then let me go with our Transport Via Plants, which is more of a six, you know, level. Yeah, it looks like a very pretty island. Give it to Cassandra? -- her the boots. It's like different tiered armors in Warcraft. It's the worst. To the Sun Tree. Aw. I see it, and I'm like. You know, I know him. I can put in a good word. What? What? I'm gonna let that go. (laughter) I'm assuming I found a tree that was close to her cavern that's big enough? Okay. I try to stealthily sniff Scanlan. Does he smell like-- Okay. 14. (sniffs) Ah, so nervous. Does he smell like the incense that I smelled from him before? You smell like a sad man. All right, let's go. I say to the Sun Tree, I say, I like your new haircut. I have a new one too. Okay, let's go. Does it look like the blight of the trees is getting more concentrated the closer to the top of the mountain? Grog, is this what happens when you pee on trees? We should talk with Pike when we get home. Make sure you're okay. No, his bladder infection's fine. Did he find anything out? Did you find anything out? Can I do a nature check? Fancy that. That's good. 21. We have Pass Without a Trace? Natural 20! MARISHA and If only it mattered right now. Pew-pew-pew. 37! Thanks for that, Microsoft Outlook. That was gonna be my question. So like the petrified forest in Arizona? So these trees have been dead for hundreds of years. All right. And there's no new scarring. That's very good. Did you read if the island was trapped or any type of arcane presence on it? Thordak made this his abode? Like the kind that gives you a really bad headache. Can I from a distance maybe do a nature check? Are these almost like siphons, like wells where he was sucking the life force? Oh my gosh. Always quicksand. Why did I never find quicksand? 22. So it's like a magical quasar? That blasts out? You figured it out, Grog, good job. I got a rock. I can Stone Shape it a little bit thinner. Does it look like there's-- am I there? I'm not there yet. All right, I'll go up. Is there a crack that looks like it can kind of just whittle it away, that's kind of already started with the boulder? I only have a limited amount of space that I can carve out, so the boulder might be too thick, but if I do it at the seam line, I should be able to do it. I want to do it at the seam. Does someone want to check for traps? Do I want to scry on the inside, or are we just going in? Do I want to scry and see if she's there? Are we just going in? Well, if she's not there. Yeah, that's better! Oh, they're still alive? God damn it. God. Okay. All right. That's big. All right. Does anyone need to do anything else before we go in? I have to pee, too. I have to pee so bad. (laughter) It's both? Little bit of both. Does anyone need to do a thing? Okay, okay, okay. I know, we have him! You've got a little bead of sweat on your forehead, Vex. It's such a humid jungle. I'm waiting to sculpt a hole in the door. Son of a bitch. All right. In spelunker-Keyleth mode, I'm looking through the hole with my Darkvision. What do I see? Oh, son of a bitch! That's a one. It's so fucking dark, you guys. I shimmy out and say, Vex, go in the hole. I could try, like what you said. I can always, worst-case scenario, burn another 4th-level to finish this off. Yes, we have. Do you have a relationship with all of your inanimate objects? Sure. Why would you say that, Percy? Man, I feel like there's a lot of secrets. Well, let me see. I crawl back in the hole. All right. You know how, like, a blade of grass can break a block of concrete? I'm doing some monk shit, all right? (laughter) No, creeper. No creeper. Okay. I shimmy back out and I say, no, apparently that takes like 1000 years. (laughter) The What of Whatness? It's a giant rock. It's a boulder. Bigby would be an upper-level spell. Grog. Do you want to try and use some of your basic mechanics of physics? Of leveraging? Don't assault it. Don't insul-- don't insult or assault it. If you could just-- I know. I know. This one isn't for you. If you could take Kima's sword, pry open a crack, let us slip in-- Well, don't you have the dragon sword? Definitely Pike. Pike and Grog, Pike and Grog. Oh, that's such a good idea. We can just wedge it in there. Yeah. That's a good call, you guys. Wait, we're all doing a strength check? Just straight strength? 13. Because it's wedged? She could turn into a person. She can also teleport. Let's not forget that. Okay, let's keep going. What is it? These are dead things. This is bone. Yeah. Yeah? In terms of my vision? It kind of rushes past you really fast, it's a little disorienting. Can I do a-- this is some CSI shit. 30 total. Can I do-- I wanna do a quick check. This is some Bones-type shit. Can I see if these bones were charred recently, or once again, if these bones have been there for a long time? I know this is some weird carbon-dating shit. Ooh, that's good. 28. Years old, if not longer. Okay. But wait, was Thordak here over a year ago? That's when Allura and her team encountered him. It's kind of like buying Starbucks with the company Amex. So easy when you have the pin code. (laughter) You freaked everyone out, Matt. No, don't worry about it. Mind you, she's still closer to death. Yeah, I go and find Percy. And I link arms. Okay, I kinda guide Percy as we go through. Being stealthy as fuck. Oh, like some weird Pompeii shit? Like he died that way? Oh, jeez. She didn't bring Thordak back, did she? We're gonna have to fight an undead dragon. What if we turn and just face the skull so it's looking into the corner. So it's not looking at us. Oh man, we should totally invest in those little pantyhose eggs. No one else is in this room, yeah? Can the half-elves with Darkvision do a little-- Don't fuck me, Gil. Oh, thanks, Gil! That's not bad! Perception, right? 26. Keyleth is gonna go ahead and light up her fire hands. Go Percy, go Percy, go. It's all a cosplay prop. That's all it is. Oh, it's so blood. Oh, you're so right. I think that's the word, yeah. And then I come up and I say, can I pet your wings? I've never pet them before. This is our method. We are Spinal Tap! I have this ringing in my ear. Don't, Ve-- Vax. (laughter) Oh, that's cool! It smells like strawberries! Perfect nightvision? Nothing, for you? Still blurry? I look over Vex's shoulder. Maybe, I don't know, anything? I know Primordial. Scanlan goes up and looks at it. I thought we figured something out. Oh, I don't know. I was lighting my hand. I can do it. Are we gonna light this brazier? Keyleth goes up and just sticks her flaming hand right down into the middle of the brazier. Do I make a dexterity save as well? Yeah, that's fair. Grog! Did you see that? That was awesome. (shouting) Is the door open? I'm sorry if I'm speaking loudly! (laughter) (shouting) The door is not open? What? I go with Percy. I do that. Inspecting the shelves. Completely? It's open? Flame-wreathed skulls. (laughing) It's the Kiss army. I think you have Zebrawood. Oh wait, we're rolling initiative. Fuck me. That's cocked. Natural 20. Why can't I have these when it really makes sense? 22 total. Me and Scanlan, nat-20 brothers! For Scanlan who's not here. Pike? Who rolled one? It's a 2nd-level spell. Oh dear god, I knew you were gonna say that. Hang on, hang on, I'm looking up the parameters of the spell. Let me see. L-M-N-O-- (sings) For a revolution. Huh? I got inspired? Sorry, I got distracted. Okay. Which direction were we heading? There's only two right now? Okay. I'm going to cast Moonbeam on... hm. Let me do this one. That guy. That make sense? So it's 120 foot, it's a concentration spell up to a minute, and it's a five-foot radius, 40-foot-high cylinder. It causes searing pain and takes 2d10 radiant damage after a constitution saving throw. It's a five-foot radius. Can I? Then I do that. Fail. Oh, that's good. Above average. Six plus seven is 13 points of damage. You know, just a little bit of radiant damage. I'm on the-- are we all on the carpet? We never did that. Then I will back away towards me and towards the southeast corner. Yeah. Southeast to you. No, no, that's right, that's right. That's good. This is the room! It's also still the room. Everyone except Scanlan? Or still Scanlan? Wait, dex throws? How many do we-- oh, we have to roll it each time? Natural 20 on my second. We're trying to beat a 13? I cleared all of them. No rolls for Scanlan. Okay. You saved from all of 'em? Same. 17, natural 20, 14, 18. Made of polyester. If you saved against all of them, 56? That's with a nat 20? With a nat 20, you still take half damage? I saved all of them, so I'm at 50 hit points. There's one that's almost dead. What's the one that's almost dead? Fucking dick. Do you get a grit point? You get a grit point back. Kill it! Kill it! Grit point back. Did you know? Yeah, I saved all mine. You saved all yours. With a little singed hair? What the fuck is that? It's a number. It's still alive? Kill it! Why are you running backwards? Pike. Do we have maybe like a group heal, 'cause I'm half hit points after flaming Night Riders. I passed all of them, one with a nat 20. Look, man, we can't all be Grog the barbarian. That gives us advantage on all saving throws? How long, short rest? I mean, I could burn a Mass Cure Wounds and heal us. I don't know, I feel like that was gonna happen. She's a smart woman. The least that we can assume is that she knows. That's something. Song of Rest is 1d12 healing points. Plus 12? Plus 1d8 plus? Sorry. Plus 1d12, right? He adds a 1d12. Hit dice. I'm not doing great. I'm gonna burn my last few hit dice. I'm at 95. Would he do a bump right now? He probably would, wouldn't he? Probably. Is he-- wait, hang on, wait, I feel like he texted. No, he didn't. Hang on. How many bumps of suude does he have left? Would he do it for after Raishan or before? I think he would do it before, too. So he has one hit of suude left? Holy shit, this feels so weird. It feels so dirty. He gave us instructions. Come on. Just straight constitution? Okay, unextended spell Metamagic? So what does that buy us? He has one sorcery point. Wait, how do you spell sorcery? How do you spell sorcery? He can double-- So he could theoretically die by doing this. So wait, he can double the length of one spell. The duration of one spell. And it could be-- wait, question. What if it's one action? Could it be two actions? He could do it back to back? So only if it's below 24 hours. One sorcery, double, okay. All right, all right. Holy shit. Keyleth is going to just, before this short rest, is going to give one Cure Wounds to herself. Just to top me off. Keyleth is at 116 hit points. Is this a spell attack bonus? What? What ability check? His charisma plus his proficiency bonus. Big money, no whammies. That was good, get some Police up in here. Who hasn't made it down? Have I made it down? What's going on with the blue light? That's what we pay you in. I'll be behind Grog. Kerr, with Grog. That looks safe. Guys, in Latin, Jehovah starts with an 'i'. I go up to the edge of the rope bridge that Percy's now standing on. I lean down and on the dirt I cast Druidcraft. Can I craft some vines to help reinforce the bridge? As this happens, Scanlan sings, hey Percy, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, hey Percy! Hey Percy! Hey Percy, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, with your gun! With your gun! And then he gets a point of inspiration. Thank you. I feel like I had the same witty repartee as Sam Riegel. That's cool. 14. Can I, as a quick reaction, grab the rope bridge? An infinite loop of falling? Six seconds. Oh, come on. No, come on. What about from Keyleth? Are they both attached to the broom? Does Keyleth have an action? You still have the inspiration, right? 'Cause he's on the other side, correct? All righty. Keyleth's gonna go. Seeing Percy misfire, Keyleth is going to grab a Grasping Vine on the side of the wall, and she's going to go for that broom. 'Cause both Pike and her are still grabbing onto that broom, yeah? You said she was 30 feet away. Can she not hit the wall, get a vine off the side of the wall and bring her down? I've got a 60-foot range to this spell, plus 30 feet from the Grasping Vine, right? Or is it 30 and 30? I thought you were still grabbing onto the-- To the broom, and Pike's still grabbing onto the broom, yeah? I'm going for the broom. Come on, man! (laughter) Grasping Vine! What? What? Just general dex? What? I love you. That was a natural 19, so that is plus my dex, which is plus two, so 21. Hah! I mean, (yells, grunts). Everything's okay. Sorry! I'm holding on, man. Also, as a bonus action, I can switch the direction of the vine to lash out at the same creature as a bonus action, so can I grasp a vine and hand them off and stair-step them down? Right. It just says, until the spell ends, you can direct the vine to lash out at the same creature on my bonus action. So. Well, I don't wanna do that. But I can't change the origin of the vine? I'm not on the rug! Can I get on it as well and still maintain the concentration on my Grasping Vine? What? I'm trying to hold the concentration on their Grasping Vine so they don't get fucked. So I'm going to get on the carpet. That's true. But I have advantage on concentration checks these days. Also, Grasping Vine's not a concentration spell. It's a bonus action, and-- no, no, it's a concentration spell. Scanlan does have Dimension Door. I'm maintaining concentration while floating next to Kerr on the carpet. How close are we to-- So we're not close to Pike and Vex. If Kerr's kicking me off, I'm reaching for Pike and the broom and still trying to maintain concentration while trying to reach for those guys. I do? 14. I have my advantage 'cause of Warcaster, yeah? That one's cocked. Okay, yeah, I beat that ten with a 26. What? Are you grabbing onto the carpet? I let go, and can I switch to a Gust cantrip to try and push us down? It's a pain in our ass, but it's really awesome. Dead bodies falling to the ceiling, reaching up, yeah, no, it's cool. This is definitely a Brendan Frasier movie. And I go over to Percy and I say, smitten. Smitten. I thought everyone was over. Son of a bitch. Grog, can you backpack Scanlan? And jump really hard? Can you attach the Chain of Returning to the hammer? How much time has it been? What's up? Top Gun high-five! And I give her a big high-five! What? High-five, woo! It's her and Pike? Now I give her a high-five. Don't put these ideas in his head. We're just not light enough. I reach down and I grab a little pebble and toss it towards the fountain. Pebble. How high, roughly, is the ceiling? Only 15? Can I do an investigation? Can I do a closer look at the fountain? Man, I hate investigating. 20 total on the fountain. 20. No gems? I don't see any gems? Something magical about the fountain. I mean, we could have Scanlan do a Dispel Magic on it. Dispel the fountain. Or the gem. Or I could carve the gem out of the ceiling. But that means you have to touch it. I can teach you later, Grog. Hey, Grog. If it comes to that. Don't worry about it. I stay with Grog and Percy. Nothing? No sway? Both have light? Do we wanna split the party, half one way, half the other? We can Dispel Magic the fountain. I could also get rid of that gem. We have options for dealing with that fountain. I mean, if it's just a trap then it's just a trap and we avoided it and we moved on. I hang back with Grog. Grog. What do you think, man? What do you want to do, you want to fill it with water? Do you think a full fountain would help our case in this instance? We can try it. Do you want to fill it with water? All right. I support this endeavor if you want to do it, Grog. She rolled good. And then what? What? Hang on, what was your theory? Maybe we can do process of elimination. Hey, Allura, good theory. Let's run. Let's run. I knew it. Or in LA? And, as always, don't forget to tune in for Talks Machina on Tuesday night with Brian Foster. I'm sure he's going to have at least two of us. Throughout the week, I'm sure, he will announce two of us. I hope they got those Tetris stickers again that they had a year ago, those Tetris stickers were dope.
