Only a few hats left. MARISHA and Yes, tomorrow we have a last-minute special edition Signal Boost episode that is a stocking stuffer edition. Yeah, coming out tomorrow, and it's got, like, coupons in it, so you should watch it. And also everyone likes coupons! End of statement. Also, there was a playlist that we put out that is a collection of all of the artists that we have boosted over the year. Except for one because they're not on Spotify and it's not my fault. But yeah, go check it out and I also wrote a little thing giving some insight into the background of the show. You're welcome. I'll be here all week. Yeah, not really, it's Christmas time. Potions! Potions! That's not too bad, not too bad. That is pretty good for Pike. 17. Yeah, it's pretty good for Keyleth. Oh god. I feel like he's real good at everything. Piece of shit. Okay, I don't know what to do here? What are we trying to do? Do we have a plan? Should I try and burn a big spell? Okay, before I do something crazy, based off of Percy saying that, I turn to Vex and I go, by the way, I've been meaning to ask you about that, if he ever followed through, so stay alive, we can talk later! Okay! And I pop over the corner and I'm going to cast Tsunami? That was Tidal Wave, this is like a big daddy version of that. This is my 8th-level spell. So I create a wall 300 feet high, 300 feet long, and 50 feet thick of water. Yeah, he's not bigger than 300 feet, is he? None at all? Well, it's also a six-round spell, and he's supposed to get stuck in it. Nothing? No. Because I'm questioning mine. "But, hey, 8th-level spell?" Did you just say that to me? Holy fuck. Just on the first round, though? So it just doesn't keep him restrained? 20. It's better than-- yay, 8th-level spell, to quote Matt Mercer. I'm not digging! 26, 35, halved. But it's not going to do anything to him on subsequent rounds? Yeah, it says any Huge or smaller creatures must make a strength saving throw in order to move. So he gets to move out of it no problem? Is that essentially the deal? Yeah, but is he moved back? All right, I'll take that. Pike's going to do a thing? Is that an AOE thing that she's going to do? All right, here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to move in this area over here. Kind of poke into this building? No, no, I don't want to go that way, I want to go behind-- sorry, this isn't very-- Yes, that way. Thank you. Yeah, sure. Yeah. It's going to be so great, it's going to be great. I look at him and I go, yeah, 8th, I feel you, man. Fucking sucks, bro, all right, let's do this. I didn't have to roll. This looks bad, but I feel okay about this. I didn't get hit. I'm good. Is that for everybody or just for her? Oh, shit! We're going to be real disappointed if you can't take this all on your own. Are you feeling lucky? Percy! You should have done it. Wait, Raishan said that? I turn to Raishan and say, I don't take orders from you, I'm only doing this because it's a good plan. And then I run in. If I run my full movement, can I get into touch range with him? Okay, angry at what happened before and realizing that not a lot is probably going to work unless I get ballsy, I run in guns blazing, and I am going to do Contagion on him. I'm going to attempt Slimy Doom. In honor of Zahra! And her teaching us about hentai! I know, I'm picking the right one. I'll do a green one. Green's good. Shut up, Travis. Ooh, that's not too bad. That's not too bad, plus 12? So that's 28! (laughs) Redemption! He has to fail three. That's all I got, right? I'm going to turn. Grog, you're still down, right? I'm going to do a bonus Healing Word on Grog. I'm going to go ahead and do it at third-- Second level. But it's max. Eight plus six. 12. To three, so 16 total. Burn it, burn it! Burn that shit. He has three, right? Goddamn it, Jarett. That's awesome! Good spell! That's good, that's good. Come on, this is what you're built for. This is why we trained you. Yeah, he also has to save against my Contagion. He accidentally stepped on one of his elemental friends. I feel like I saw you, in like the fire plane! 'Sup, man? 24. I'm okay. I'm on the ground, but I'm not super low. I'm still full on hit points. Well. Did he ever make that save, by the way? It keeps going. It still goes. Yeah, it's a seven-day thing. If he succeeds three? I thought he just had to fail. More damage. So you might want to do that at a lower spell level, and keep the higher levels for healing. Here, I've got d8s, how many do you need? It's like when you're in trouble. Are you shooting Kima? Maybe you'll kill it. Kill it! Oh, jeez. Come on, man. I mean, I could have handled it. Oh, boy. Yeah, all right. Not that one, not that one. Gil! Don't fuck me, Gil. All right, that's not too bad. 19. So, I still have this asshole in front of me, right? But he's been pushed back? Yeah, that's cool. I will stand up. Rise up! This guy in front of me is almost dead, right? How far away is Thordak from me? Okay. I am going to-- Can I move up one square closer to Thordak, but not get near the-- But I'm in this cloud, too! Shit. I don't, but that's nice. And now I'm going to-- Am I? Oh, because of the Heroes' Feast! Oh, that's right. Oh, well, fine. Right. And then I'm going to cast Blight on Thordak. I think so? I did! I did a thing! Not too bad. 11, 17, 21, 23, 25, 31, 35. 35, halved. I take a few steps back. Can I tuck into that little broken building, a little bit? Just inside the doorway? Perfect. How are you doing? I don't know how we got here. What? Oh. Hm. Yeah. Okay. Well... Okay. Well, then instead, (reverse words), take me back. I can only do 15 feet. All right. How many feet am I from the elemental? No, I'm not going to blow a 4th-level spell on his ass. I'm going to do a 1st-level spell, though, and do a Thunderwave. Yeah. Yes. It does not. It takes 2d8. Ooh, that's good! Ten damage! Please kill it, please kill it! It's a radius. Oh, no, sorry. It's a cube. It's a cube, 15-foot cube. Got rid of that fucking asshole. All right. And that's all I can do. Okay, now I'll tuck into there. There you go!MARISHA,  (half-hearted Wilhelm scream), TALIESIN, TALIESIN It's never not weird. Oh yeah, Kima. Oh shit. It can't hurt. It's got to save against that shit. Good job, buddy. Man, good thing we gave you that flute. Yeah, wait until we're-- he's on the other side of the continent. It could like-- That's better than 11. You can do that. Yes, it was. Wait, over what wall, over what wall? Yeah, is this one that Zahra and Kash were guarding? Can I do it? Ooh, yeah, 25. Means they're still alive. Hopefully? The last thing we do is die as we see a bronze dragon show up. So she's on top of me, more or less? I'm going to turn around and Tidal Wave this elemental behind me. Extinguishes all flames. No, the other one was Tsunami. That one is like the big daddy version of this one. Yeah. Sorry, Percy. I'm saving your life, man! Is this damage for Percy? 21. I'll pop myself out of the door a little bit. Contagion, he has to do that at the end of his turn. Did he do it at the last...? So he's saved against two or one? He's only done-- I know about one. And he's saved against both? Are you sure? All right. Do I see Gilmore? Then, yeah. He's not looking too good? He has to roll a save. Does he still have disadvantage on these? Yeah. He has to roll under a five. It's resting in peace with my 8th-level spell and her dragon-slaying arrow. They're in a puddle somewhere. Are we going to try and take Raishan out as well? This is far from over. Popcorn on a trampoline. Yeah, I want to see how this works. Oh boy. Okay. I'm going to stand up. Question. Is Thordak within 30 feet of fire giant dude? Okay. That answers my question, then. I'm going to reach up and do Blight on Thordak, 'cause I think I can, this time. 30 feet. Fucking shit fuck balls. Okay. Then-- No. I'm in a skirt situation. It's not good. No, it's just clumsy. Okay, I'm going to do-- everything's not ideal right now! You don't know! I'm not good at that. I'm bad at that thing. So I'm not a dextrous person, so instead I'm going to use my Spire of Conflux. Look, I haven't forgotten about it, all right? My ancestors. And I'm going to do Chain Lightning on Thordak. Fail, motherfucker! Fine, that's fine. It's how many damage? Like 8d10? Yeah, I do. I need one more. Oh, and I get to reroll ones, right? That's actually really-- No, that's a seven. So that's 29, 34, plus-- that's a seven. And then 34 plus 14 is 48. And there's no one else within 30 feet of him, other than Raishan? No one else? Well. Okay. I do that, and then I turn around and I'm going to cast a Grasping Vine as a bonus action. Right next to me. And then I'm going to use it to whip around and grab Percy and-- I haven't used any movement. Can I shift into that house a little bit? Uh-huh. And once again cast Grasping Vine from out of that corner and drag Percy to me. Around the ankles. Hi. She's getting ideas. Oh, no. No, Vax, no. What if it was 17.99? That's basically like 18. Do you want some d8s? No, that's-- oh, he's already committed. Should we do what he does to us? 15! 15. He needs horse blinders! Horse blinders! Can I say over like a headpiece thing-- Be like, twins, if you're still alive, I think Raishan's coming in your direction. Yeah, we're heading ass-- Hauling ass that way! Fuck that wyvern. I say, everyone in the hole! And I head towards the hole. (singing) Black as your soul! What? Yeah, I'll dash. Look, he's a great security guard. Kill it real hard. What's going on? Whatcha doing? Just describe the scene. Wait till I'm there! Wait till I'm there! Wait till I'm there! Don't let her touch him. No no no! Don't go, don't go-- I said don't let her touch him. So she's coming towards us. I mean, she kind of released Thordak. She's totally Little Finger. Where is she? Are we going after her? I mean-- I run deeper into the hole. Poor Jarett. We'll go to the spa afterwards. 25. I rolled a natural 19, so 22. 70? I'm actually still up at-- What's 101 minus 119? 18 points. Yeah, maybe she was doing it telepathically. Team Rowdy Half-Elves, what's up! Half-elves, running in, recklessly, yeah! Like we do!
