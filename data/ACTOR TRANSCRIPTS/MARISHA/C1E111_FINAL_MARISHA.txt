Also, clarification, speaking of saying things prematurely before I should have. I've gotten a lot of questions being like, "What happened to that plan of rolling out one a day once a week?" Yeah, that plan didn't turn out to be feasible. And I might have said that-- I said it, and then I looked down at the announcement sheet and it said in parenthesis afterward, "But do not announce this part." Which, why was it even on our announcement sheet? Still my fault. Oh shit. Anyway, it's never going to happen because they're easier to do in batch. So ten at a time. That's what you get. It's just better to do them in a block. The digital issue. The first issue releases digitally this coming Wednesday. Because you don't read your emails. They get your unbridled reaction. I love Atlanta. Australia? Is that when we got caught with having to have those weird travel visas, as well? Yeah, we didn't know until we got to the airport. And then they're like, "You have to have one." And then we're like, "Oh, okay." Luckily, you can do it online. Do we need to do a switchery-poo of our items? We just stopped, right? You dug things out? (whoosh) Me. That's going to be a Reddit thread later. That's what we're doing. While they do that, we're timing the steps out. Ugh. 15. It also saves me a 6th-level spell. So you know the first and last letter of the alphabet? Don't worry about it. Save a life, check a sconce. Do we have any idea how far we've climbed? Hey! Natural 20! That's a Gil 20! Okay, all right. Nipple level? The heartburn region? A little acid reflux? He has acid resistance against reflux. Called it. This is a fucking incinerator. I knew it! This feels like an incinerator. No? What? He's looking at me-- (nervous laughter) Or lasers. Laser incinerator! Duh! Is it curved? No. The whole room isn't curved. It's a square room. Wait. Before we do that, can I reach some of the ashy stuff? Hand me some ash. I'll test it. Okay. I do a nature check. What does this ash feel like it's made out of? Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. (groans) Oh man. That's a one. Thanks, Gil. I blame Gil for his natural 20 in the balance of the universe. And maybe it'll open again. If I was the person who designed this, why would I put a failsafe in here? I feel like there's got to be another entrance because we can see another room, right? No, I know that, but a lot of things have reflections. I go up to the mirror and check it out. It's cooled off enough, right? Where were they? I walk over and I heat them with my heat hands. A fire elemental. Well, when I'm a fire elemental. Can I do it right now? Yeah. I just took a short rest, so yes, I can do that. So what's the end goal? What am I doing? But what if the buttons are correlated with the symbols? Yeah, if I touch the symbol, there's nothing there, right? It's just a wall. I do a quick Gust cantrip. Hang on, I've got a paper ready. I take my mantle and start doing a-- I love that we all did something similar but all wrote something different. We're like, numbers, somewhere! Did you help us, or are you just saying "almost?" I think this is right. I think you have this. I think I have the right part of this and you have the right part of this. I'm going to go up and go tap-tap-tap on the mirror. Grog draws boobs on himself in the reflection out of the ash. It's this. Tell him to do this. I told you there was a room behind the mirror. Guys, it took 111 episodes, but we bested a door. Can you see through it? So it's a big 180, going right up? Did you fuck the roll, too? Oh, what the fuck! We are following behind. I still have my hands guiding Percy, our blind human. (laughs) Where's Steven? I think we're in the lungs. I think we're in its chest cavity. I can get that. I'm interested. Well, if it's on the way. We have to go that way. Can I see any stairs carved in the side, in the walls, trying to head up to this-- is that what you just checked? What about the temple? Why? Are your Titanstone Knuckles exalted yet? Are they buzzing more? Step two steps closer. Do they appear to be buzzing more? Yeah, but as we've already seen from the other tomb, it's already been heavily, heavily plundered. How far away is the temple? Do we know? Can we football range guess it? Hang on. How long have we been in here, versus how far have we been from Vasselheim? Because we are on a time crunch. Super fucking fast! I just want to say, we gave you guys the other temple, in which you found your stupid waistband, but we got really fucked up from it! Everything has a consequence and a price and shit. Nothing is free. Let me do it. I have Pass Without a Trace and one more 2nd-level spell left. I'll do it. Save yours. How about this? Hold. Wait! We still don't know how to get up there, right? Yeah, do you like it? Thank you. It's a little metallic. Thank you, I bought it while I was waiting for-- TRAVIS and Okay. I hate to say split the party, but what if we split the party? What if a few of you check out your fucking temple, and then the rest of us try to figure out a way to get up. Temple party. Who else is on temple party? So wait, just the two of you are going to go check out the carpet? Okay, so Grog-- Okay, cool, I'm on board. 26. Are you serious? We're trying to go up, right? So it's like 28 Days Later zombies? He said that they were fast. Just wanted to make sure they weren't special. And we still have Pass Without a Trace, so let's go. Yes. I didn't do anything. Keeping that concentration. TALIESIN AND Yeah, it's a very small amount. Yeah it's dried. I spent that time. I spent time during the break. Be a distraction? How far away can he be, though? I've been very conservative with what I've been doing for a reason. I agree with Grog. We can't sacrifice having him gain all of those followers, because then the only option would be murder a lot of his followers, which I'm not really comfortable with. I want to go on record and say I think this is stupid. Okay, let's go. I have to come with you because I have the Pass Without a Trace spell. Wait up, we argued more this game more than anything else. Okay, we know we still have to fly upwards, including on flying up to the blue crystally thing right? Well, then what the fuck? We fucking fly! I can burn a spell. We're probably going to take another short rest, right? Okay. You're on me? And you're on carpet, and you're on broom? Giant eagle. Not yet, though. Okay. Why didn't you tell us that before? By the way, they're all staring right at you. They're 100 percent aware of what's going on. What happens? So we hope. Nothing happened to them when we put it in the Bag of Holding? They were like, (groaning) and kept going? All the undead? Are we flying? I have keen sight. Does that count? Oh, shitty and shittier. 28. I have a plus 13, plus advantage. I take the lead, I guess. (caws) You said things or people? Is this a body-sized hole? How is it lining up towards the steps of the giant? Much quicker. So it's very slow, but not as slow as the rate he's walking. I'm not against this idea. It's like that dress you bought four years ago you still haven't worn. It might find a purpose. Wait, there's not a hole that we can go up? It's a barricade. It's like steel rebar in front of the door. That's what I was going to say. Is it a water chute? Drainage? Is this a drain pipe? Does there appear to be any other type of chutes coming into this room? I'll be with you. Yeah. I'm right behind you, man. I'm at the ready for whatever. I've got the other one, so I'll be second. Keyleth in front of Grog. Samesies. So it looks like a landing? No, if you're going to take a quick glance, then we have to bust them open like a proper RPG. I'd imagine because he's vertical now instead of horizontal. Oh, so they're cultists. Little bit of that reach around. Viskon? We've heard the name Viskon before. Odell comma tell Viskon we have visitors. Wait, when did we hear Odell before? Don't let them leave. I agree with that. Did everyone roll shittily? 15. What's up, bro? Get it! Get it, son! You have that guy? But this guy was the runner, I thought. Okay. He's currently grasped. Between him and Grog? Him and the other guy? Or just between him? How big is it? Fucking fuckface. Yeah, it just might hurt. Don't let them leave! Who looks like he's controlling it? Odell? (yells) Oh my god. So much has changed from what I thought I was going to do. Yeah. So I come up from the staircase. Okay. I'm going to come up. I'm trying to think of what I have in range, and I'm terrified. And I'm going to stick with my original instinct and do Wall of Stone and try and wall these guys in so they can't run. I think they can still carve through it with their big black death orb now. Okay. I can do ten ten-foot by ten-foot panels, so I want to be a semicircle block off, bring up a whole wall of stone behind them. I do have Dispel Magic. Can't cast through it. Even though it's a nature thing, going up underneath there, I can't get around it? No? (singing) I'll see you on the other side of the wall. (laughter) Wraiths. Hey, was wraiths what fucked me and you up when we were evil Vax and Keyleth? I look over my shoulder and go Oh no! Misses! That's right! I leveled up, motherfuckers! But I feated, so I'm good! War Caster? Does it have to be a bonus action? Sorry, I'm trying to figure out what would be a good idea right now. I have never done this before, but I have it learned. I will Ice Knife it in its face. Ice Knife! Level one, you create a shard of ice, fling it at-- oh, it's a flingy-thingy. But it's 1d10 piercing damage, and then it explodes? No, hit or miss, the shard then explodes, the target and each creature within five feet of the point where the ice explodes. Oh. I'm fine. I'm doing it anyway. What's wrong with us? One. Yeah. 2d6. Technically, reroll ones. Three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah, each creature. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. I hate this force field shit. Wisdom and death plus what? Beautiful. You didn't get through? (screams in frustration) Whose turn is it? Get the runner! He went that way. We've got to take out these guys' eyeballs. It's not good for you, but it's good for us. Fuck them up! You're confusing Entanglement with Grasping Vine. Two totally different things. Okay. Seeing Grog slam into that. Ugh, fuck. This is a pretty beefy spell, yeah? Force Wall? Should I do fifth or sixth level to dispel this? Okay. Fifth or sixth level? Sixth level. I'm going to Dispel Magic this wall. Higher than sixth level? The spell. Okay. It's higher than seventh level? Did you have to roll? I don't know now, you guys. I move forward. I guess. I don't want to move that far forward. No, I don't move that far forward! (laughter) (singing) I want you to be alive. LAURA and Yeah, I'm going to pull out my staff and do a Burning Hands on him. Dexterity saving throw. Half damage. And then there's a third one that is a six? Was that right? Six and six is 12, so 16. I can't believe I couldn't fucking dispel that wall. That was how I lost to Grog in our battle. Sanctuary! You shall not pass! Keep them from running away. This is all on you, man. This is all on you. That's a good call. Kill him! Oh, it's fine. There are tunnels collapsing and shit. It's fine. I'm not concerned about the noise at the moment. Okay. I run up as far as I can, 30 feet. Do I see this motherfucker? Or I see the glimmering of Bigby's Hand? Fireball! (laughter) What the fuckballs? Does he? Magical? 29 points of damage. He's still going after my ass? You beat me to it, man. Keyleth goes up to the red robe. Vax, can I borrow a dagger? I take it and I stab it in his other eye. Red robe guy. How many of those symbols do we still have, and how many robes do we still have? The guy that I'm standing over, red robe, I'm going to rip his necklace off. So they were holding on to that orb the whole time. Yeah. He didn't cast it, though. We didn't see him cast that. Yeah, Grasping Vine! Yeah, move away! Wait! Keyleth stares with a vague familiarity. Yeah, he knew River through that. But if he cores out a tunnel for us, we can carry Scanlan like on a palanquin? Like We Are The Champions? Fuck these guys! We got all their shit. Let's go! They can lie. What is it? Might as well. Okay, hang on, though! What are we going to get from this guy? I'm going to go pee, you guys. Everyone looks upset. How much? A lot? Oh, that's a lot, yeah. Throw them down the well. Oh yeah! I feel like I always come back from the bathroom right as we're ending games. Our comic on Wednesday.
