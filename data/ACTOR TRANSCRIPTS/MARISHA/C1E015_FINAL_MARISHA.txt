I want that! Thank you to whomever got us this amazing super cool looking bottle of scotch! MATT, TRAVIS AND I know. Check that out. It's Taurez Brandy. There was a card on the box. We sort of wanted it now, so we jumped the gun. I blame Sam. Well... Thanks, Prometheus! That's true, yeah, Taliesin's coming. Thank you! Hi Liam! We miss you so much! Hi. How's New York? Yay. (laughs) Seriously... Well they're a bit divvied up right now. I believe Pike is holding onto the sword, correct? I'm holding on to a Ring of Protection plus two, and a Belt of Dwarvenkind. Hello Percy! Hi! Good of you to join us! Yes, how was your flight? That sounds about right. Please! Look what we got. This is a gift from-- what's his-- It's brandy! It's really good brandy. I have a Ring of Protection plus two, and a Belt of Dwarven- It gives you a plus two bonus to AC and saving throws while wearing this ring. And then I also have the Belt of Dwarvenkind. The Belt of Dwarvenkind? Yeah, you guys remember this? It gives you a plus two to your constitution modifier. You have advantage on charisma/persuasion checks with dwarves... and you have a 50% chance, each day at dawn, of growing a full beard. If you are incapable of grow-- oh, that's right, because you guys tuned out! Yeah. We realized this at the end of the stream. At the top of the day, you have a 50% chance each day at dawn of growing a full, thick beard if you are capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker beard if you already have one. And if you aren't a dwarf, on top of this, you gain the following additional benefits while wearing this belt. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, resistance against poison damage, darkvision up to 60 feet. You can speak, read and write Dwarvish. That one, you should keep. That's just fine with me. That's fine with me, I generally have enough spell slots. So yes, we also got the Coldsnap Leather Armor, plus two, which I was originally thinking for myself, but then I realized I actually have decent leather armor that gives me spell advantage, so I'm good on leather armor. I thought-- are you sure sorcerers can wear it? I thought they could wear robes. Do you have any armor on, Scanlan? Would that give him a plus two to his AC? Who wants the Belt of Dwarvenkind? Grog? What's your constitution right now? Constitution up to a 20. Yeah that's true. I'm not going to lie. Or does it dissipate at the end of the day when you take it off? I would just like something to help my AC. 15. Are you sure? I'd feel bad. Because Grog doesn't wear armor either. He has better benefits if he doesn't wear armor. You keep take that, I think. It gives you a bonus to your dex. But that means everybody got something, right? Did we divide it up that way? It does what the pearl does but times three. It's true. (giggles) That is a true story. He wants to make Asami's glove. Shrapnel? Oh, I actually join him. While he's gone, can I look around to see if he has any books on how to start-- like a potion making for dummies book. More protect-y. More-- Yes. 6,500. We tossed it in with a deal and stuff. Stuff is expensive. Wait, did I find a book? 18. So I take those books. How much are those books? So I take that book. How much is that book? How much are these books? Yes, I'll take both of them. 50 gold. Also, did I talk to Gilmore about potion classes? He'll take it into consideration. Okay. Like, maybe? Okay. (singing) Don't fail me now. Guys, we've got to go back and get our money. That is like 30k sitting for us in-- Six hours! That's so true, you have! Only with dwarves. There might be some dwarves! Can I go read my potion book? What dice are you rolling? Yeah, can he roll? Roly-poly bear. Did I learn anything from my herbalism book? Dope. Dope. Huh? I mean, I'm proficient in nature. Yeah. Druid, yo. Okay. (laughs) Yeah. What time is it? On like a Sunday? Roughly. Okay. Who is this? Kima. I know. What is this airship made out of? And like Skipper Veera? Who was? Oh, the airship. I was about to say, I run over to the side and look over the edge before he says that. Does the platform have like a ledge I can look over? Like the Empire State Building? I want to do that. Guys, this is really high! I climb up on the ledge. Grog! A little bit. Guys, guys you should try-- Grog, hold the edge of my shirt, I want to feel like I'm flying for a second. Woo-hoo-hoo! Guys, you should try this! I know, but I'm always an animal. Selfie staff! Yes, we are. Selfie staff. That's a good one. Cargo. Can we see Castle Greyskull? Hi, Greyskull Keep! I know, bye! Thank you for the food, it's so good. We didn't plug 826 at the top, either. So yeah, for those of you who might be new, those of you who are veterans, you already know, but 826LA is our charity of choice. They are a after-school non-profit program for kids K-12th grade, and they focus on creative writing and imaginative storytelling and they're right up our alley, and they have awesome storefronts. They have the one in Mar Vista and the one in Echo Park if you are LA local, and there's probably an 826 in your area. Yes, we need that, I messaged them about that and they're totally down. So yeah. What what! What? What happened? That'll include us? We're going to shoot a rap video? By the end of the show? Oh, is this going to be like a role reversal thing? In like an alternate universe? (laughing) Yeah. Oh wait, didn't we have cake? I want that cake up in here. Are we going to wait? Get some shirts. We forgot to wear one of ours, but they're cool. Yeah. We made those in honor of E3. By the way, I will say, Soul Hunters is a misleading title because that sounds dark and ominous and it's a super cute game. Yeah, wouldn't you think it sounds dark and ominous? It's super cute. It's like with cute chibi RPG characters. Yeah, I know. Yeah, and me too. I'll read books. I'll also go ahead and-- oh you have this book! Are you reading that book? I'm going to make a few scrolls in my time as well. What should I make scrolls for, guys? What's handy to have? What's handy to have? Well, yeah, I can make spells into scrolls. Right, okay you're talking about the Levitation and stuff. Oh yeah, that's true. I'll make a Polymorph scroll and give it to-- This isn't World of Warcraft. Well I can make-- I just put whatever spells I've learned for the day, I can put those-- depending on the level, like a 3rd-level spell scroll will take me four to six hours, so the higher the spell, the longer it takes. So, if I spend two days I can probably make four scrolls? Four or five scrolls? Yeah, that's some pretty good shit. So I'll definitely make a Polymorph scroll for you. That's the way it was in Pathfinder, I am using Pathfinder rules. I know! (singing) We went shopping! It's like I have a little familiar. A scroll-making familiar! Four. Okay, how much gold do we have left anyway? Okay, so I still have a little personal money left too. No, it's okay. No, I'm going to do it. That's what money's for. I'm going to do two Polymorph spells. And give one to Vex and one to Tiberius. And I'll take 400 out of mine. You'll give me 400? All right. Shit. I also rush to the deck. Feather-covered? Can I do a nature check? Do I do a nature roll first or should I do an initiative roll first? Can I do a nature check first? Cool, look at that! Turn on Twitch, turn on Twitch! Oh, that's not bad, that's all right. I'll take that. 17. Yep. (laughs) Rolling dice in New Jersey. Grappling? Oh no. Oh no, he's going to throw him over the edge. He's going to toss his ass over the edge! Does someone have a reaction? Can someone do anything? Reaction? I have some Grasping Vines? It would make it-- Well, it would make it difficult, he would have to break against strength checks against Grog and stuff, yeah. You say, "Bad dragon!" Or go peace out. Did you have disadvantage? Oh. Ooh, you're the shooty guy. I'm going to move my speed over here-ish. And then would you say I'm 60 feet, within range of that guy? Oh, am I? Well, let me back up a bit, then. Just right-- Oh, I can walk across that. Oh, fun. Right. Gotcha. And there's still a rider on that guy? Okay. I am going to cast Polymorph on that wyvern, and I turn him into a bunny rabbit. Oh, I am going to kill a bunny. That is true. I just think it's going to be funny. That's pretty much what I thought. I guess make a wisdom saving throw-- the wyvern has to make a wisdom saving throw. 18. A wyvern. A bunny. Or you know what, you know what would be funnier? Yeah, we'll stick with the bunny. Bye! He came prepared. Thanks. That was my turn. Fail! Actually, yeah, I think-- It lasts for the duration or until the target drops to zero hit points or dies. He just, you know, is a falling bunny. Will you let me know when he hits the ground, when he falls? Yeah, it's the same. You throw a penny, you throw a cow off the Empire State Building, they'll both fall at the same time. You got this! Ouch. Ouchies. Oh. These guys got skills. Yeah. Okay. Go Percy, go Percy, go! What's a wing shot? That sounds awesome. Oh. You mean literally. Right. Sure. Yeah. (laughs) 24 hours? (laughs) Birds hate lightning. Yeah, it's been a while. Yeah, Jersey. I go, Hey friend! Let's do athletics. Oh. It's okay. 15. It's okay guys, I'll be fine! I'll be fine! This is fun! Prepare it for dinner. Oh, were you trying to skewer him? You and Ashley. That makes up for so much shit. Before I turn into anything, I take in the scenery, and I'm like, "This is peaceful." Nice. And then I turn into an air elemental (whoosh). Yes. Not a shark, I know. That would be funny. And I'm like, Oops. It's okay, I'm air. So I'm there. I turn into 'poof.' Okay, cool. I'm only 20 feet? Awesome. It's 60. It's the same, like all of them if you're moving through air and such, I'm pretty sure. Okay, so. Who's the nearest bad guy? Is that a bad guy next to him? Or is that a guard? My air elemental's a big space, right? Okay. So here's what I do. I go up and I'm like (whoosh) this big dark scary cloud, and then I go up and I'm going to do Whirlwind and I go full tornado. Full twister. They have to make a DC 13 strength saving throw. Awesome. On a failure a target takes 3d8 plus two bludgeoning damage. So I'll do that real quick. That's okay, so two, one, roll this one. Five. Ten damage. And he's flung 20 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. Hopefully it's randomly off the side of the ship. Wing? Fail, fail! Oh wait, and if the target hits like a wall he takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every ten feet he was thrown. If the saving throw's successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung or thrown-- Yeah, he still takes five damage. That ends my turn. To be fair, you're in Jersey, so. Is that wyvern flying? Son of a bitch. Come on, you guys. Son of a fuck, we can't lose our captain. Damn it. We hit 4,000! Rap video. No, Wilhelm! It's like a word of the day calendar, Healing Word of the day. Nice. Nice! Tug-of-war. Batman. Do it! Come on. You're a badass, nameless NPC. Is that like the only track we have? Is that bandit hanging on, is that the deal? Come be protected by my sweet wind gusts, yo. Yeah. True. That's like the most average, that was like exactly average. He's making sushi. Maybe you were counting this in. Why did I get in this line of work? So everyone seems-- the only thing that's left is the wyvern, right? Oh, one you've got a rope on? And is the ship still like ahhh? It's still a little crooked? Okay. I, in my air form, I'm going to fly over. I'll go through, and I'm going to use just my air form to lift underneath of the boat and try and stabilize it. Okay. Use my air dice. Eight. Outside of a natural 20, wow. Cool. Well, I learn that the boat's heavy as shit. That's what I learned this turn. Thanks. Oh, it's okay, I don't need, you know, comfort. Don't need validation. Save it for Orion. Your armor class is 17. Did you write that down? I know, I don't feel bad about taking the ring. Unleash that load. Yeah. The closer. Wait wait wait. Can I catch it as an air elemental and bring it back up? 12. Oh, I'm an air elemental, shit shit shit. Forgot. Can I try and get that out? I guess so. To be fair, we did lose one over the edge, so we might need another crew member. I know, it was trolling over here. I drop the elemental form. No longer a tornado. I know, it's so cool! I know! It was nice. I'm okay, I'm okay.
