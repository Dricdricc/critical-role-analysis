Yeah! The first epil-- episode. The first epil, of-- Epil, epilay, epilogue. The first episode of Signal Boost went live on Tuesday. Go check it out on GeekandSundry.com. Go watch it, it's good fun. And you should go watch it so we don't get cancelled, and we'll keep making more episodes. Apparently! It's crazy. Yeah. And I talk about Rat Queens, in it, and-- And I tell you about cool things that I like. That I picked out myself. My favorite things. Done. Love you, Seattle! And we are not held responsible if that happens. That's a good idea, I've got a set of green dice. I'll get them out. Sure. Got to get them all out. And I got this in Ireland, so it counts. It counts. And this is green. Damn it, you beat me to it. I was going to say those two aren't mutually exclusive. Children and traffic. What time is it here? That's true, we did sleep, actually, we camped out. Remember? You talked to Zahra, and I talked to Kash? Then we slept. We at least chilled. I don't know. It's always weird. Not crawling out of trees, that people like us. Kima-- Wait, what? Why? I can always attempt to scry, and see if I can check in on her. Okay. Let's get somewhere safe. Here, I guess. I don't know. I forget it's not overrun by vampires, I'm sorry. Sorry, I forgot; it's all right now. Like right here, sorry, there's a lot going on. Your shirt, is that new? Because I love it so much. Are we heading to a tavern? Oh, corpse armor. Be very careful when handling this armor, is what we're trying to say. It's leather? Do you have fancy leather armor right now? What does your armor do right now? Anything? (groans) Not again. Why do things like living in gems? It can't be comfortable. Encased. Like something put it in there. Ooh. Any way we can find out what it possibly is before we summon it? Well, does it change size? We don't even know how to open it up! Do we know how to open it up? Hang on, okay. Let's think about this. What do we remember from the great Purvan's story? What did he fight? Can we get purple cardstock up in here? What if he's friendly? I mean, he talks about being an ally. Well then, wouldn't we want to save it? She's like-- neutral. Maybe we should save him and release him when he'll be valuable to us? Who knows if he'll go back in willingly? But wouldn't we rather be friendly with him than him be angry at us the next time we release him? But we could win both. But we could have a trap and a friend. Why don't we try and do a little bit more research on Galdric first? (muffled) What if-- We g-- mm, sorry. Little bit of saliva. Snacks. We go to those goliath caves, right outside of Whitestone, that were abandoned. Those! Sorry! I just remembered you recognized them. They were empty, and abandoned, we could go there. No, we saw it on the way into Whitestone. We're healed, right? Did we sleep? Do we need to sleep? Like drink? And I should probably scry and check in on Allura, right? Where'd Kima go? Anyone else want to go to the-- I go up and put my hand on her shoulder. Hey! How's it going? Yeah. Want to check in on Allura? Is there an empty room around here? Doesn't need to be that long. Sure. We'll try really hard to find better things to do with our time. Okay. Just pick one. Yes! The flower that I gave her before we left. She's alive, her and Drake both are alive. They're at the Cobalt Reserve, which is in ruins, as well as the rest of Westruun. Yes, the black dragon is there. Looks like he's taken up residence in the black spire-- tower. What was it called? That one. No, I can just look in and see. She was grabbing the last few important tomes, remnants left from the Cobalt Library, I mean, Reserve. It didn't look like it. I don't know, I didn't see. I don't know who all's coming. His wife and children are here. As well as Gilmore. You haven't met Gilmore!? Man, I just assume everyone knows each other. He might have... been... slain...? She's the dragonborn-- Not only did he escape, he tore a giant tear in the rifts between the Fire Realm and ours. Kima, Kima, it'll be-- Sit here, you want to sit down? Let's go outside. What? Okay. Yeah. Keyleth has a hard time looking her in the eye. Vex, I don't want to ever see you like that again. I don't want to ever see anybody like that again. We all watched you die. It's like-- I guess... you could say, probably an unseen entity, an unseen force. Oh, I'm lightheaded. Okay. Percy-- Let's skip that. When we brought you back, Kashaw performed a resurrection ritual. Yes. And he called upon a deity and at first he was afraid that it was Vesh. Which he was quite terrified about. Yes. That, I don't believe, is the presence that answered his call. I thought I was going to lose you both. I thought I was going to lose you and Vax. He-- I don't know. I don't know what he did. He said to take him instead, is what he told the entity. He offered his life for yours. And my biggest fear was that neither of you were going to come back. He offered his life for you. And for all we know, that offer was accepted. If I had to guess, it was probably the Raven Queen herself. He seems to do that quite a lot. I stay behind and burst into tears. In the outhouse? Sorry, keep going! Siege arrow. That's fun. I have a question. Would Keyleth and Scanlan be crying in rooms at the same time? (singing) Beneath the pale moonlight I open it. Hey. Hi. You okay? Come in. Sit down. How do you feel? Do you still feel her? I don't know if it was very noble or very stupid, to be honest. Probably a little bit of both. I can attempt a Greater Restoration spell, and see if I can sense anything. Can I? Just lay back. I think this goes beyond any natural realm that I have any bearing over. And I hug him. I thought I was going to lose you. And I'm terrified I'm still going to. And I think I love you. I just don't know if I can allow myself to. I'm terrified to allow myself to. You do realize that, if by some crazy chance, we all somehow make it through this domination alive, with the Chroma Conclave, and I complete my Aramente, I'll still watch all of you die. Everything could go phenomenally well. And by becoming Headmaster, we enter a bit of a realm of immortality where I could live for a very, very long time. I'm afraid every time I look at one of your faces that it's going to be the last, and I feel like deep down I know that day is coming. So because of that I'm afraid to let myself feel anything deeper than I already do. And for the second time today Keyleth bursts into tears. Why do people keep leaving me in rooms alone? We're in a drought, god damn it! It's been a while. Do we come out and see Vax in the armor? So I guess I step out and see him looking at it in the hallway. I walk by and... briefly lock eyes and keep going without saying anything. A coffee enema? Going to the caves on the edge of the woods. Going to go through the woods. Wait wait wait! Fortress. Whatever. Should I throw a wall up? Do I need to bar the entrance? Or are there doors? So we're going to try and talk to it? Scanlan? You prepared? So, those two are stealthed-- I'm at Scanlan's left shoulder, back a bit. And Trinket's next to me. I'm rolling with Trinket. Yeah, we don't know how to use it. I pet Trinket, like, 'Chill, chill, be cool'. Wait, use Speak with Animals? I cast Speak with Animals. Okay, I cast Speak with Animals. And I crouch down to the ground. And bow down a little bit, and I say are you the one they call Galdric? Was Purvan your master? Oh my god, I get a secret! I can respond back, right? Your master died a great champion for the Raven Queen. He has been paid a great honor, and now the Raven Queen has chosen a new master. I continue to speak to the wolf. A great darkness has fallen upon our lands. Upon Othanzia. We could use all of the assistance that we can achieve. Would you be willing to find a new purpose? Join Vax'ildan-- Yes? Galdric. Please. Approach your new master and look into his eyes. Look into his eyes. I said look into his eyes. And see the touch of the Raven Queen inside of him. Galdric. Grog, don't move. Don't move. Look at the dog. Don't move, and don't hurt the dog. Please just look at the dog. I spoke words at it. Apparently that's not good enough. Communicating. Very aggressive? Okay. Okay. If I turned into a dog. If I turned into a wolf, do you think he'd respect me more? I take my staff and I say, Galdric! I'm being assertive. You want a task? I'll give you one. I don't know. Oh, has it not been ten minutes? Okay, we walked back? Okay, I'll cast it again. Can I cast Speak With Animals on other people? I can't, right? No. With advantage? I'll take the-- what is that, 16? Plus a six, so 22. He talked back. Okay. (louder) Galdric. Only a beast of your great fortitude-- Right, okay. Sorry. Would you like to guard-- -- the town, Whitestone? (shouting) Guard this town, dog. Yes. Galdric. In exchange for food, shelter, and a cozy fire every once in awhile-- Patrol these lands. Protect these lands. Why does he want details? Why does the dog want-- (clears throat) A great danger-- Approaches! A great danger approaches. Your service is required until that danger-- Has passed! Is no longer in effect. You'll know. You'll know, because they're fucking dragons, man. You'll know. Protect-- Then you are free to go. Thanks, Galdric. Appreciate it, man. I look at Grog. How was that? Did that sound okay? Thank you. It really liked you. You should learn how to talk to animals. I think you-- yeah. You know, sometimes the teleportation makes you lose your lunch. Trinket? You all right buddy? You all right, there? How was the ride? Did you feel all right? How was--? What was it like in there? Was it--? Okay, that's good, that's good. Would you mind-- Would you mind doing that, you know, frequently? On occasion. MATT "If she wants me to, okay." You have a lot of men who will do anything for you. Oh my god, you're right. We don't have to worry about it. We can, it's fine. That's the other Vestige, correct? But we can go wherever we want as long as we've been there before. Oh god, I'm immediately nauseous. Oh, Trinket, buddy. What time is it? Does anyone have any fire-resistant items? I might pick up some fire resistant potions as well. They're pretty sleek. Are you fully attuned? Percy, you have access here in Whitestone to alchemy supplies, correct? I mean, we could take the rest of the evening and I can attempt to make some fire resist potions. Well, we're going to be in for a fight at the Fire Ashari as well because there's a giant sunder in the fire plane, and last time I checked there were fire imps and elementals pouring through there. They're annoying Well. I mean, we could theoretically see if there are survivors and I can attempt to close the tear in the plane. I don't know if I can do that. However, I don't know anyone else particularly more qualified to attempt it. We're talking about the Fire Ashari and possibly what to do there. We can go and look for survivors-- And someone should probably close the tear in the fire plane. If there are survivors-- They've survived. I agree. It's not going to be pretty. I really don't. Can I start telling that to people in real life? Yes. Your secret is safe with my indifference. To look for survivors and close the giant tear in the fire plane that evil, well not evil, fiery entities are pouring through. I have another question. Before we all go to bed tonight can we get like a fuckton of the green stone under Whitestone? Say like $1,000 worth and maybe have like a real nice Heroes' Feast before tomorrow? I've got to do it at night, because I have to Tree Stride in the morning. Yes? I like that plan, yeah. Sounds good to me. Yeah, sure, why not? Can I make some potions and then, like, I make dinner for us before we go to bed? I'll do a damn feast. All right, okay. Yeah. Yeah, let's do it, let's do it. Let's go in prepared and then we can always rest on that side. Aw, an arcana? Do I get advantage because of my little skill in alchemy? I'm skilled in alchemy. Yeah. Okay. Intellect, which makes it plus seven. Do I have advan-- ooh, I rolled a natural 19. Just one? Fire. Fire! What? Oh, god, you snuck up on me. Scanlan. Go fuck yourself. This is fine. This is great. I'll take a nap. I'll cook breakfast, guys, good morning. Good morning! Because I have to teleport and cooking this feast are both 6th-level spells and I can only do one of those a day. Pike. Pike. Pike? I'll cook breakfast, guys. I'm cooking breakfast! I'm summoning-- yes, I'm summoning breakfast and then I'm sleeping. And wisdom. Immune to fear, poison, and what else? Yay! Oh, shit! Oh god, that works on too many levels. Too deep. Yeah. Let's go. To the Sun Tree. Oh, god. As close as I can get to the Fire Ashari, I guess. Oh, do we gain a few hours? Awesome. Can I do a nature check to figure out what's up? 16. Do they look like people, like humanoids? 800 feet? They could still be Ashari. Just in their elemental forms. Are there any birds around? I look up, do I see birds in the sky? Let's stay far behind. Let's go quietly. The string's so you don't forget. 32. As we're walking up, I fall behind and I slip Vax the potion of fire protection. Much better, that's a natural 19. 30. Those are druids. And I write-- "Hi. Hey you guys." I write, in druidic symbols, "Keyleth, Kaitiaki." And I respond with, "Help has arrived." (laughs) Yeah. They're survivors. They're survivors. What does it matter? Let's go. And I tell them, you know, "Arriving. Stand down. Here we come." "Lol. Winky-face." Oh you did, okay. 20. I use my cantrip Gust and cool areas alongside as we ascend. Oh shit! I run up. You said seven or eight from Zephrah? Hail, Cerkonos. And I run up and give him a hug. And I look back at him and I say I'm so sorry. Are these all that have survived? What? What do you mean, like, how long ago? 12, 15 years? Cerkonos, it's not your fault. There are greater forces at work here, beyond us. That's something that I am desperately trying to reassure myself of every day. Who are you? Dad! I'm sorry I didn't check in sooner. I didn't want you to be disappointed. A lot's happened. I haven't found Mom. Well. Daddy. It's good to see you again, father. Father, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for these people. They are the most capable that I know. However, since we're druids, we're a little bit more, you know. Geared. Prepared to deal with the fire. I can cast Protection from Energy on a couple of these people, if you wouldn't mind maybe grabbing the other two? And I cast Protection from Fire on Percy, you have it, you have it, do you have it? Well, it's going to protect you from fire. Scanlan? I'll do Percy and Scanlan. Father, can you--? Can only have one person going. I could cast it at higher levels. Can I cast it at higher levels? Can't do that with this one? Fuck. Well, I'm going to cast it on myself, for starters. Because I want it. So I'm going to cast Protection from Fire on myself. Halves all fire damage? I turn and I look at them and nod and follow in my people's footsteps. I'm so tired. I'm tired. How is he going to be here? Super busy, but I'm super successful. 826 Seattle! We love you.
