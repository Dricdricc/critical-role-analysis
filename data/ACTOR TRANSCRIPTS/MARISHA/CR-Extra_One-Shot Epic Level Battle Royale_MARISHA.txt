Your own joke broke you. There's the charity stream with Satine on Saturday. The Roll20 dealio that she's doing is this Saturday, all-day D&D for charity. That was the early days of streaming RPGs online, before it was a thing. It's coming. I'm working on it. I started writing today. Also, big deal. This is a big one. Talking about merch. This is a true story. We found a bunch of extra David Mack posters that we autographed and signed as hold-over, in case anything was damaged or shipping was messed up. Yeah, in case life happened. So we signed about a hundred extra and we magically found them the other day. So your last chance-- It was somewhere, I think, literally in the boiler room. No, we're a web company. We wouldn't be a mess. But anyway, they are in the store right now. This is your last chance. If you're like, "Oh "no, I saw them!" But only a hundred-- and they're gone. So yeah, last-minute Christmas present for anyone who was looking for something. If you're not watching it, holy crap. Go watch it. Not again. Wait, do we have time to precast? To do like a little-- Yes, I do! It's not my fault that my character's awesome. Can I give myself an inspiring leader speech? Come on, you got this, come on, come on. You can do this, you can do this. How about, instead of a speech, can I cast Freedom of Movement on myself? I think I'm the only one here, I don't know, I can't. I rolled pretty good, too. Also 19. Bullshit! Bullshit! Fucking Mr. Sneak Attack! Don't say that! I've lost all of them! Just my modifier, my straight modifier? I rolled a 15, for 17 total. That's your saving throw. Learn your character sheet, motherfucker! (laughing) I was so stoked about my 17. This is the last time we're going to play these characters. Hey, question, clarification on blindsight? I was going to look it up. You're blind but you can still see through you being awesome? Yeah. Okay, so I wouldn't be able to see through Scanlan's Invisibility with blindsight. That's what I was getting clarification on. I am going to cast Sunbeam at 6th level, and-- Sunbeam. Myself. As an action I get to create a beam, right? Okay. Well then, how about this? I want to peek around this corner over here. Do I see Percy? Okay, then I'm going to do Sunbeam. Did I destroy the door? Is that what you're saying? Sorry, I checked out. (laughter) Is that versus my spell level? It's pretty high. That hits, so you are not blinded but you do still take the damage. Half as much. 6d8 radiant. (counting) 33 damage total. And then I use my bonus action to turn into an earth elemental. I still have a little bit of movement, right? I'm going to use the rest of my movement to peek back around there. I saw you! Right under the table. Live dick pics. Do I get any-- 15 total. No, 16. That makes a difference. Feels like about 45 pounds. Oh, sorry, 75 pounds. Four-foot five... That seems tall. The inside circles? I don't trust that. Oh no! We've got an idea of where he is. I was going to say, does he win the battle? Just waits? Oh, shit. I want to go, hm. Bink, bink. Oh hey, Scanlan! (laser noise) I'm going to Sunbeam the gnome. Wait, but I've already cast it. It's a concentration spell. Fuck! Yeah, you save against it. 27 plus five, so 32. He already did. Oh no, wait. Oh, concentration. And I'm going to use the rest of my movement to go-- I'll go there. What did you lose? Oh, your Spider Climbing is gone too? That sucks. No, I don't have anything to do. Never mind. Are you going to say that every time someone gets hit? Might want to save your shit, but all right. 13. Can I do the Locomotion and do a traveling dance? How long does this last? I have to spend an action? What kind of saving throw? Jesus. Such a fascinating game. Give it time, dude. Okay, I don't see anyone. In my, what is it called? In my Terran language I say, You fucking asshole! And as I'm dancing I'm going to try and make my wisdom saving throw because I can't do anything else. Don't fuck me, Gil! You totally fucked me! No, wait! No, you kind of fucked me. What's seven plus 14? 21. Question. Because it's cast on my elemental form, if I switch wild shapes, will it go away? Okay. I'll use my bonus action to turn into a fire elemental. It only knocks it out for a round? Or for when it's turned on? I have a question. Would Freedom of Movement negate the dance spell? It says, "For the "duration, the target is unaffected by difficult terrain and spells and other magical effects can "neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained." Damn it! I love this DJ! You know what? I'll take that! Enjoy the show, Scanlan! Technically my office, so it's an even stronger statement. You just m'lady lightning struck me? This is so great. No, that was a natural one. So I take it. How much was it? You would do that for me? That's true love, right there. Switching masks. Give me this shit! I want to save from it! Natural 20! (grunting) Bink! Do I see Scanlan? (laser noise) Sorry. Sunbeam! Oh! I have a bonus though. I will use my bonus to go back to earth elemental. This is open, right? Can I do a big old jump into it? I do that. Don't fuck with me like that! I took you seriously for a good two seconds! Oh, those were good rolls, too! Come on, believe in yourself, man. You did. Very much so. Who's on deck? You are? No, stay. Hang out. That's pretty bad, man. That's real bad. Do I feel anything around me? 60 feet. Okay. And no one's been in here, right? You tried to go in there and then failed? I'm going to go (roars) and then use my siege abilities to just beat down the wall. Five plus seven is 12, 24 plus five. Okay, I'll go ahead and open that. 30 feet walking. Okay. This is like a building, right? Okay, I'm in there then. Is he close enough to where I feel a body go (thud)? Damn it! What did Matt just say! We all know you have that! I smell so bad. I'm sweating so much. I need deodorant. Yes and, Travis. In Terran I say Hey Grog! Okay! Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, that's even better. What do I have to make? I keep my spell attack, right? No, I'm good. Yeah, then I just made it. No, I'm totally good. Can I take Grog and use my slam attacks, my multiattack, to take him and body slam into this chest? Yeah, sure! My strength versus his, yeah? I'm just an elemental; it doesn't tell me that. I rolled a natural 18. So that puts me at 23. Which is a slam attack to hit? 17. Which isn't great. Six plus three, nine, plus five, so 14 damage. Did it release a poison trap in any way? I'm immune to poison. Does he take poison at the top of each turn? That hits for sure. Ooh! It's pretty good! Did I break any potions that were under him when I slammed him into the chest? I'm going to take my movement to get the fuck out of here. Can I go 20, use my bonus action to turn into a water elemental and then dive under this water? All of them. Yeah. Archdruid shit. That ends my turn! Can't hear shit. I'm stealthing, if that was not clear. Hiding under there. Stand here. Yeah, you beat me to it! Good! Man, you beat me last time with a really high roll. I'm going to come out of the water like the Swamp Thing. I'm going to beam Grog with another Sunbeam. Your half damage is a ten, (counting) 21. Not a great roll this go around. I'm going to go into my earth elemental form and-- Is this an actual window here? Okay! Yeah. Sure. He can't hear shit. It's a patio heater. Man, we get so catty when we can! It's so much fun! We're never mean to each other, you guys. I like your crown. Okay, that's fun. That's one spell I wish we got to use more in-campaign, it's a fun one. This is going to be bad. 12. All right, let's go for a ride. Whee! Yeah, a hundred percent. Just a straight con save? Not good, seven. This is like some Freddie Krueger shit. That was the blue spheres? I'm going to use my bonus action to turn into an air elemental and fly. I'm so hot. So sexy. My fly speed 90 feet. How many rounds has it been? Do we know, roughly? Nine rounds. Then I'll use my last round to-- --of Sunbeam. This is my last round, right? I'm going to fly directly above Percy. Looking down over top of him a good 60 feet almost exactly and right below me going to do my Sunbeam down on top of his head. Fuck! Fucking no one did! Fucking everyone! 25 damage. I'll fly that way to that corner. Don't look at me like that! As the elemental, yes. It's my Sunbeam that I've been rolling concentration checks against. I'm War Caster with pretty high wisdom, so I'm trying to make it easier to not fail a concentration check. Oh, do I see Scanlan? (helicopter imitation) LAPD! (helicopter imitation) Yeah, end of my turn. I would like to say, I feel like I've been playing pretty aggressively. Waiting for that first blood. Waiting for it. Oh, poor timing. Oh, good call! Yeah. Okay. Stealthy Pants McGee. Followed by a Homer Simpson into the bushes. Followed by that kid that's like "Oh shit!" as he runs by. How did you get up the tower? I'm trying so hard. Okay, so Grog is suspended, being repeatedly beaten into the ceiling? And I saw a black streak go this direction? And I know Percy's somewhere in the tower, but I don't know where? Okay. Yeah. Let me just try and find people. I'm going to fly over top of where that is and see if I can see anything. I'm going to look for a stealthy Vax. How much movement was that? Okay. Do I see anything from my awesome aerial perspective? Can I use the rest of my action to move down? To just move? Let me drop down 60 feet. Or half my movement speed or something like that, right? That's my turn. Did you make fog? Did you do Fog Cloud? Ooh, the m-word. And Percy shot you! He's going to use all of his spells to just Healing Word. 1d4 at a time. No, but here. I'm going after Vax too! Ba ra ra! Oh wait, we decided I can because it's telepathic. I'm trying to find my boyfriend! He fucking ditched me at this bar! Fucking asshole! Oh, your other boyfriend? Okay. Oh sure. Sorry. This is a big-ass map. I'm going to look around. No sign of Vax, I'm assuming. Scanlan, he's too fucking stealthy! I'm going to go punk Grog. And then I'm going to fly up within 60 feet of him. I can't find him! I looked! He's not going to let me do another perception check! I tried! I'm going to go up and be like Sorry, Grog! And hit him with a Blight spell. Let's say level-- Let's say a level five Blight. 49 points of necrotic damage. Where'd that minus 16 go? 49. 42 plus seven is 49, right? Sorry! Next is the blue, so let me go to that back corner a bit more. That's good. Remember when there were water beds? Good times. Terrible for your back. 9th-level Healing Word. Do it. I'm so stealthy, I've lost myself. Going assassin this time. Or thief? You were assassin last time. Goddamn it. You are the literal worst. So wait, is the fog cloud there or no? No, he means it is literally out. I'm going to hover over-- First smoke. Where there's smoke, there must be a Vax, so I'm going to hover over a little bit. Move me up 30 feet or so. Or 60 feet. That's good. And then I'm going to be like, Hey boo, I recognize that spell. That's some druid shit! And then I'm going to light up the entire area with a Fire Storm. Radiating outward. Ten of them. All damage? At least I've taken out all y'all's health potions. That was part of the goal. I'll back up a little bit. Trying to stay away from Scanlan. Wait, what's your range? If I drop down behind the tower, could I not be seen by Percy? Fly across this way? That's your only evasion that you have, right? Until you get hit? You can keep doing that until-- Wait, but I thought you have one that gives you half damage and one that's all damage? A reaction? To quote the rogue You don't know. They're climbing flippers? I thought the circles were going? The fires? Did I get behind? Goddamn it. That's fine. Dex saving throw? 15. I am immune to grapple. He put a time limit on this whole thing. It's a bottle rocket! Oh wait, nope. Okay. My turn. I've got a prone Grog in front of me. I'm going to do something great, right? Shit. But what to do? (grumbles) Oh god. Sorry, Grog. I'm going to try this one more time. I'm going to land. I'm going to drop my form. I'm going to say Don't save against this! And I'm going to try Plane Shift! Because it fucking failed last time! Mine, 21. I think it's wisdom. Do you have any preference on your demise? No. That's too nice. My original plan was to teleport you to the middle of the water dimension, just have you slowly drown. SAM and Or my other idea was to send you to the Maze of the Abyss. Yeah, we'll go to the water. I feel so bad! Man, that doesn't feel good. It doesn't feel good to be a bully, everyone, let this be a lesson. I still have movement, yeah. Scanlan dropped his Reverse Gravity, yeah? Scanlan's there. Do I have enough movement to move over there? Actually, you know what? No one's in the tower, right? You went over there. Oh, shit. Goddamn it. Do I have my bonus action still? I do, right? I'm going to use my bonus action to turn into an earth elemental. Oh fuck, yeah. It is. Let me go over there. I can't reach. I'm going to use my awesome mantle which allows me to jump. What? Just my modifier? My strength score is 14, so I have plus two to my strength. Let me jump behind there. Do I have enough, with the rest of my movement, can I get inside this building? Then I'll stay there. Take me out to the-- what's after that? The crowd! I have Freedom of Movement, too, cast on me. That was so good! Thank god for that fucking 4th-level spell. Only when we reach level 20, boys, only when we reach level 20. Early game druids kind of suck, later games, kind of boss. What do I have to save? 22? Let me do the math really quick. Yeah, I'm all right. I rolled a natural 16. I feel so bad I had to teleport Grog away, but I'm still looking for Vax. Did you turn it in? Stay turnt. Yeah. 28 what damage? Eight. That's 36 total. It's okay, everyone hates me tonight, so were all in the same boat. Huh? l will look, though. I didn't have any concentration spells up either. In case you come back. Let me actually check. Fuck, I hope this doesn't fuck up. Peek around the corner. Do I see Scanlan? (laughs) Sure. I'm going to peek around, see Scanlan and be like Hey, buddy! You see Vax? Cool, good to know. Feeblemind! Fail. Well, you still have to roll for it. Feeblemind level eight. Range for Feeblemind is 150 feet. I should've backed up. And what does he have to do? Yes. You rolled a 19? Fuck! I should've fucking been out of range! We're both really good! I respect you so much! But we're so good. We're great. And then I'm going to go to my earth elemental form. I've still got shit to do. I'm going to use my movement. Can I jump back over and run behind the tower this way? 30 feet. This way. Instead of curving around, can I just go straight away from the blue thing? Just in case the blue thing hurts. Instead of curving, can I just go further from the blue thing? The blue? The blue thing went. So the circle is up next. No, if that's the case, let me step back. Right there. All right. Just straight intelligence? Do I get anything? As the earth elemental? I keep my mental stats, though. Not that that means anything. Okay. I'm trying to make sure that I don't have any type of weird resistance-- Terrible! He tried to do what he did to me! Okay, I take how many? 11 psychic damage? So I'm at 115. I'm still going. Don't count me out. Yeah. Well, I'm currently shifted. Casting a spell isn't considered a part of Wild Shape. It's an inherent druid nature ability, it's not a spell. Who, me? Do I see Vax at all? Probably not. I'm going to use my bonus action to turn into a water elemental and swan dive into the water. Then I'm going to swim over to the edge of the pond where Scanlan is. 90 feet. Yep. I'm going to come out of the water and I'm-- You fucking Feebleminded! I can still see, motherfucker! I still have eyes! I'm going to come out of the water and I'm going to attempt to whelm him. Whelm. Make a strength saving throw. Failure! It's an attack. You take 2d8 bludgeoning damage. 11 plus four, so 15 damage. You are grappled and unable to breathe. Do I still have movement? That's okay. I just want to take my grapple with him and my whelm and take him back under into this creek. Yes. Whelm. It's my ability. I'm basically a big elemental and you're stuck inside of me. I mean, you're stuck inside of me until further notice. Yes. And I'm now under the water, hiding with Scanlan inside of my belly. Aw, I knew he was going to do that! The blue? Does that mean it skips? It's my turn already? Okay. Okay, I pop my head out of the water. Do I see anybody? Okay. I'm going to switch to an earth elemental. I'm going to come out of the water. I'm going to walk over to the edge of the tower. I'm going to be like, fuck whoever's in this shit! And go boom, and start bringing this tower down with my Siege Monster. Do I have to roll to hit still? First attack, 14. Okay, that's 2d8 plus five. I do. That's 15, wait. Yes. 15 damage, doubled, right? So 30? And then second attack. Much better than that. It was a natural 12, so plus eight. So 20. Fuck all y'all! I'm stupid and angry! Oh, boo! That was so good! Did you not realize? It's what fighters do. I know exactly where you are. That's a good call. You disengaged? Kind of. Do I see Percy? Oh wait, I can feel him. Me? Are you thinking that's going to save you? Okay. What do I want to do with you? That is such a question. What's next? Next is the fire, right? Oh. Hang on. Can I make my way to them? Yeah. Here's the question. Since I know kind of where he is, can I use my bonus action to turn into a fire elemental and go to him? I'm going to do that. My fire elemental movement is 50 feet. Uh-huh. Actually, shit, I didn't mean fire. I meant water. If that's doable. It's fine. I already called it. No, I already called it. I have 50 feet, yo. So pouty! First, I'm going to enter your space immediately and you take 1d10 fire damage and you catch on fire. Seven damage. Two touch attacks. I'm doing both attacks at once here. First attack is 22. Second attack doesn't hit either, then. But you're on fire. Do I have any more movement? Can I move through this crack on the other side here? Sorry, boom mics. Wait, when is it the top of the round? Did the torches go, or no? Sorry, I'm totally helping the DM. Ballsacks. Okay. Blue, that's gone. I know he's around here somewhere, yeah? Over around this side. Can I jump into the water and swim around as a water elemental and see if I can get to this other side? This might not be the best call. If I get around here, can I poke my head up and see if I find him? I just projected where I was going to be, though, he could just change his fucking mind! Don't sext him while you're at it! Jesus! Well, I was jumping into water elemental to go around, but if I don't feel him land, then I'll go earth elemental. Let me start stomping up and over and seeing what I see. (grumbling) Okay. Do I see anything? Do I see any flying asshole rogues? It's a good mechanic! Brutal! That's a good idea. Yeah, I thought it was going to be me and Grog again. Yeah, if you had closed the gap, that's it. That's down for any of us. Nine. So nine now, and then another four. So, 13. As the internet said earlier, we're really bad at shit-talking each other. Just embrace it. Kill him! Is that a crit? Damn it, so close. Not that I'm cheering on for your death or anything. I'm just excited. I'm excitable. Oh, Scanlan! We could have been pit fiends together! But I got Feebleminded! Oh no! And you died! We waited too long! We were going to be awesome! Damage? Yes. Pretty much everything hits these motherfuckers. All right! Let's dance! I jump. As I jump, I'm going to turn into a water elemental. Ker-splash. Then use my movement speed to come up. I'm going to try to whelm Vax. With my dope mantle. I'm an archdruid! Beast Shape says that anything that's on me absorbs into me. And elemental is my form. 20 strength. How much speed do I have left? So 45. Can I get to Vax? I can swim! I'm a fucking water elemental! Blub blub blub! Whelm again. Each creature in the elemental's space. So yes. Then I'll do my two slam attacks. Bam bam. 20. Misses. I've got to roll high in order to actually get you. That's even better! 25! Roll, baby! 17 points of damage. Okay. That's it. Not a bad call. Was so hoping I was going to have Vax in that water. It's just us kids. Wait, is that magical? No, it's straight damage, right? What was the first one, 56? That's not right, either! No, that is right. What was the other one? Yep! I'm going for that motherfucker right there! Then let me go earth elemental and walk on over to him. There we go. Total? I can't get any further? Yes. Okay. Yeah. There's nothing I can do as an earth elemental with Feeblemind. Sure. I'll get right up in his face. I can't grapple him? I can't do anything? Okay, wait. Is it all the way up into here? Sorry. I don't mean to retroact things. If that's the case, can I do an air elemental and fly over? In that case, let me do a fire elemental, if that's okay, and then I'll go 50 feet. I've got 50 feet of movement and I can move through one-inch spaces. Can I get in his space and catch him on fire immediately? Are you still on fire? Should I have rolled again? Six points of damage. I go Hey, Scanlan, I found him! I found Vax! Scanlan? He's on fire. I can still attack him. No, I just walked there. What do I have to roll to hit him, by the way? He's down and unconscious, so do I have to roll? Yeah, both of my attacks hit. I just sit on him, I'm like Sorry! I hit him twice. Sorry, boo. Hit. I'm really easy to hit. So 37 total? What's the first one, is it piercing? Which I take half of because it's not magical. So 37 total? Okay. I mean, I can do that too. Just a straight con save? Don't fuck me, Gil. That's good. 20 total. Okay. Whose turn is it? So wait, what did the field just do? Did it do the torch or did the torch already happen? Cool. Cool cool cool. I'm going to go earth elemental. Oh yeah! I'm going to jump all over, Kool-Aid man style, do a big old fatty jump leap. Or, if I can get to Percy? Okay. I can't jump over it? Am I within ten feet of him? Fuck! Okay. That's it, then. Can I move five feet to reach him? He still has a decent amount of hit points, though. This is a force wall. If I throw him into it, it's going to suck? Okay, can I grapple him and pummel the shit out of him? I'm going to grapple with the first attack. Don't fuck me, Gil! That's not bad. 19. Do one more attack on him. Do I get advantage on the grappling? I just attack him? Not good. Sorry, 12. Saved with a natural 18. You are still higher. 17. Oh, and he's stuck? Can I take and through this wall, push it and start crushing Percy? Two slam attacks with the wall, crush crush? Against the wall or against Percy? First one is a 20 total. No, 21 total. The second one is a 19 total. Does he take any from being sandwiched? Okay. Can I use my bonus action to go earth elemental again? Then I will stay. What is best right now? Yeah, can I do two slam attacks on him again? Bam, bam, multi-attack? Not good. Same thing for that first one. Twelve. Oh wait, it's hitting the wall, though? Okay, so 15 damage for that first one. Natural 19. Strength saving throw? Natural 17, so 23. Natural 19. Keyleth, my turn? Argh! Squishy squishy! Squishy Percy! Ooh, no, ten total. And second one, 12 total. Those were bad rolls. Oh shit. Wow, yeah. I was never religious in-game, but now I am! Yeah, in 20 days I'll be like, what? I dreamt I killed you, and you, and you. But man, you dodged my Feeblemind. That was hot. That was amazing. I had to get vengeance from fucking it up last time. I finally won one! I'm the queen. Everyone bow down to me.
