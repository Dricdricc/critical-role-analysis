Merciri, roll a d20. Is this because of the Facetime error? Bring them out! Yeah, it's not slicky poster paper; it's-- Not even ten seconds. I have put on my goggles, for sure. Can octopuses see in the dark? If you do the facemask thing? I guess I'll go up front. No one's called a partner yet. So we're going to come to a conclusion later, maybe? I have no idea what we're talking about. I think I would be a little more confident if we had a vague idea of a plan? Don't get me wrong, super down to fly by the seat of my pants. That type of girl. But sneaking in, killing people in the middle of the night, two armies, fight, getting captured-- these all sound like real big stories. I like that better. Goats are weird. Square pupils. Encounter worm-- SAM and I think they still have square pupils. Can I keep a lookout to see if there's any markings on the walls? Any signs of directional type of code or language? While we're walking. 19. I have a question for Caduceus. Cad, do you have any idea how far underground we are? Okay. That was my question. (laughter) I've heard of faery creatures. I bet they live-- It's see-through on the inside, right? Ooh. Stealth checks! 31. Underwater water source? I look to see if there's any signs of life, any humans that have been here before, people. Signs of life or signs that people have been here before? Yeah, campfires that have been extinguished. 11. Just looking over his shoulder. You have no initiative bonus? 19. It's not, but no one else spoke up. So Cad, Caleb, Nott. I had a screamer earlier. What did you roll? Oh, we might. Miss. Ah yeah. Just grappled? Strength check versus their strength check, if I remember correctly. No, don't. Please stop, please stop, don't touch me. It was so pretty when we slept in a geode. That was awesome. Remember that? Okay. Can I get closer to the roper? I was hoping he would do the reel thing, but to me, because I'd love to get real. So I can hit it? Well, I don't know what else to do but to wail on this motherfucker. First attack is real bad; it's a natural two. Next attack is not that much better, 20 total. Okay, then I will reroll that one with a natural one. So that's cool. That's two attacks so far. I rolled a two then a one, technically, but you roll disadvantage. Does disengage count if you're grappled? So disengage wouldn't help me escape from it? But I already used my action to attack, so I might as well Flurry of Blows. Disadvantage on the first one. Nope, that's a two again, second one is a natural 20 and a 12, bringing me to a 20 total. It's terrible. Two! Seven damage. I turn to everyone and go I think I broke my wrist. Then that's it. Yeah. Can I do the thing? No, I have to hit twice. Never mind, nope. Oh! Can I do that? Stunning strike! (fake crying) There is a god. Okay, that's my turn. Yes, she is. Ah! Doo-bah! That's the way it works. I'm still restrained. I'm going to stir around my stick and try and jab it into his eyeball. Wait, straight roll? I'm going to get rid of all those. It never happened. I don't think it worked, nope. That's a 14? Second attack. Now it's a 19, so it definitely hits. That was with my staff I said, so it's a d8. Seven points of damage. I'm going to re-stun it. Can I do that? Stunning strike. Okay, I'm going to move on from that. 14. Flurry of Blows! Wait, why do I keep rolling twice? I keep thinking I need to roll twice. Just once. Ah! Natural 20! It's so manic, but it's true. Doubling the dice. That's a three plus a six, so that's 11. Going for the uvula. Last one. 18. For this one, I'm going to try and grab onto its tongue, because I know, lot of blood vessels in the tongue, and start trying to rip it. Another 11 damage. I say Drop it! Drop it! Caleb, do you have any use for this? Nott? Nott. Roper tongue. What? I'm still throwing rocks. Fuck. 11. Kill it with cantrips. No. I haven't seen any form of writing, no offshoots, nothing like that? It's more information, which is always good. Hey guys. I'm just saying, if we're going to be underground in a blank, boring, shit-hole tunnel for a whole 'nother day, I still have some of these mushrooms left over from Mollymauk. Might just help make it fun. I'm real bored. I'm just so bored. Yeah. (gasps) Okay! It already starts good, you guys. It was a glistening night-- The snow fell on the winding paths. It was chilly. She could feel her nipples getting hard. It starts so soon, it starts so soon! She felt the warmth of a fire. She could feel his warm touch as it was grasping around-- As his strong, burly, hairy arms wrapped around her waist, she could feel her breath leaving her bodice. This is so good, Jester! (stuttering) Thanks. As she reached down-- That's funny, that was exactly what was about to happen. I'm sorry, what? I'm going to-- I bookmarked it. Is there any remnants of precious metals, coals, things that would be mined? We've got to be, right? Would I know the exact boundary line of Xhorhas between the Empire? Do they use the mountains? If we're under the mountains, it could be a long way up, and we don't know what those mountains look like. I mean, I don't know, it also could be fall and temperate and beautiful. (laughs) Okay, here's the other thing, though-- sorry, I'm dying at the hammer. This is, arguably, going to lead to a nexus, right? Like an entry point? So what's on the other si-- Did they build a military base around the entrance to this tunnel system and is that what we're about to walk into? If we go forward. If we keep following this, is it going to lead us-- TRAVIS and Yeah, no, I know. I was just kind of throwing it out there. That's a good idea. 17. Oh jeez. Talk to them, tell them we're friends! Yeah, bot! Oh yeah! You were just lifting so many pebbles, you'll be great. Oh man, not again! (yelling) I will head forward-- -- but power walking like a badass, strolling behind, in case I want to deck some kobolds in the face. What? Why though? That's pretty good! You're just dangling. Beware the spirit of the Maine Coon. I jump down and take out one of my shurikens and chop Caleb free. Ah, jeez. Make big mess? Take the whole cage. Ah, it's rabies. The thing is going to die in ten more feet from something else. Let's let them do it for a little bit. They might have useful information. Oh, so they're not even being secretive about it. MATT and Got it. You mean like as in (projecting) Hey! We should go to sleep! Like that? My feet, they hurt. Because you're a god! I'm glad to see your true form, mistress! I'll try to look for firewood, but I'm so exhausted. No. Just visiting!MARISHA,  Spurt?!, SAM, SAM I'm interested. No, that's exactly what he said. Do you have bug allergies? Oh, no. Have you been stung? It works! It's amazing. (groans) Dodge those juices. Wait, like the green slime you have right there in the-- Oh, okay. (laughter) Would you like to follow us towards the light at the end of the tunnel? I'm dying. I am dying. Is it obsidian? Goodberries! Stop, I just got better. We fulfilled our end of the bargain. I feel okay. We're stealthing? Natural 20! And where are we? So attractive, so sexy. I mean, use a distraction, get them looking at something else. I am a great sprinter, like, real good, 100 meter dash. Right, just saying. Which cave? Our cave? Ooh. Lava monster. Would I know anything about giants, reading up on them or anything? Cobalt. 19. So probably not amicable or prone to negotiation? And they craft things so they're not stupid? Averagely smart. Yeah, I read this tome once in the library, but I was a little distracted when reading it because the monks had also drawn a bunch of dick and dudes putting horns up their butts in the margins. It just happens, yeah. In the Cobalt Soul. How fast can you run? You're pretty fast. Are we dashing partners, me and you? All right. I like it. And then we're going to go. Okay. Is that bad? Is that going to send stuff to-- okay. (deep inhale) Okay. Can't he do-- He's more magical than I am. Oh. Okay. I'm a one-woman petting zoo. Let's go. You're hitching a ride on me. Your spell save DC? Run? Plan still goes? I still have bottle rockets. That's all I got. How dare you. (singing) Don't fuck me, Gil. 26. I'm going to burn my boots. I am hauling ass across the bridge. Step of the wind, step of the wind, step of the wind! I get to move 45 feet-- is my movement, so add ten more to both of those. I don't want to get close to that guy. I'm going to parkour, and then action to run again, but I'm going to swing a little wide. I don't want to fuck with this guy. MATT and When we get to the other side, I smack Caduceus. All right, get off. What is happening? She's next, right? No? Fuck bridges. No way. This has been too much. How many times have we said cow in the past 30 seconds? Is the cow super dexy? Cow-stitution. What did we do? Nott's the only one! You have to get across that bridge, right? There is no other way? I am going to peek around the corner. And I'm going to hold my action to run and grab Nott, if I see her. To run and grab Nott, if I see her. I'll hold, though. Yeah! Oh my god, it's going to happen again! (singing) If I could find a way. Yeah, is that 9d10? Are you full health? Because you got baseball-batted. Blame Perkins for everything. I was holding my action to go run and grab Nott. I'm going to grab flaming Nott. Through the flames. (screams) Dash back. Step of the wind! And then I stop, drop, and roll with Nott. Are we both on fire or-- Sure. Come on! Yes! You are their god! Let's bounce. Looks fine to me.
