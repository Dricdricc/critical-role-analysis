That's cool! Your attack bonus. Ugh. You guys, I thought someone was going to kill him! I know, because I don't want to fucking burn any spells on this asshole. Just-- ugh. God. Goddamn it, this hopefully works-- nope. Nope, that didn't work. (tink) (laughter) Okay, I immediately turn my attention to Cassandra. Can I do a medical check on her to make sure she's okay? I rolled a 17 on a medicine check. Okay. Yeah. You know, I feel like we've been here before-- oh, right. We have been here before. Are you sure you're-- Just... let me. And I Cure Wounds him. I'll do a 4th level. Shut up, Sam. I just can't find my spell. Yeah, I'll do that 4th-level Cure Wounds. I feel like in the moment I would just do it really at a-- shut up. Right. What do I roll? Hang on. 1d8. So I'm rolling 4d8. I need d8s, goddamn it! Give me d8s. Why can't I have your d8s? That's fine, give me one more. Okay, 14, 18. (counting) 33. I back into a corner upon seeing this, as Percy ruins the moment. To be fair, you did get her throat slit, but it's okay. Percy! You have a sister. Oh, come on, Trinket. Come on, Trink. We're taking a short rest? Do we have to put him in the Bag of Holding, though? Yeah, stuff him in a closet or something for now. Zero-G boots! Oh, hell yeah. Oh, we're playing with that later. Can we all just try them once when we get back to Greyskull Keep? Jarl? What? The Undying King... Which is what he said. What! Who? Axio? TRAVIS and We know him! He's our fucking spy! He's the construction guy, he's like our head builder. Oh my god, that's right, you did that! And I put an elemental there. It's babysitting. Hopefully still there. 30 days. Put your eye out. Yeah, the violins plinking. You guys are fighting over a loaded gun. I didn't learn it. Not for today. I thought Pike's magic would hold up. If she's already controlled-- We could try it. It doesn't hurt to put a hat on. It does. Can I see, before we leave, are we near any windows? Backyard? All right. Can I try this? This is a long shot. My-- actually, our fey ancestry, from being half-elves. We're immune to charm effects. Or we have resistance. Advantage against saves. Since we have that, can we use our fey ancestry, the three of us, to tap into her and see if we can detect a charm? Wait, hang on. Before we enter it's safe to assume they know we're coming, correct? Oh boy. Quagmire. (laughing) No. (laughter) Percy's been hitting the 'roids. He's a Hello Trinket! Hello Trinket. But abrasive. Right? You're put off by it, so it works. It's working. 28. Before we go in, I go, Vax? Vax? Vax? (laughter) Goddamn it, Scanlan! This was supposed to be a passing comment, and it's turned into a thing. (laughs) Be careful. God damn it! I can't do this anymore. Just go. Let's go. Can we go? Shut up, Scanlan. Yeah, and I'll light up my hands. Boy girl, boy girl, boy girl. Put me in a happy middle. Oh! 29. Can I do a nature check on this? Is this similar to the broken glass that I collected before? I don't know. I just have broken glass shards. I feel like there was some sort of-- Yeah, we were in some cavern. Can I try a nature check on it? He's like, "It's not going to tell you shit, but sure." 15? So it's manufactured. Like when lightning hits sand? I'm wondering if it's a symptom of something. All of us? 28. God damn it! Here we go again. What kind of mist? What kind of mist? Undead ghoulie guys? Wraiths? It's that fucking shit that turned us. Shut the fuck up! Get out! It makes no sense. Yes! It's a hollow die. And I rolled a one! 14. (laughing) I can't believe I did that. Rolled a one on it. Shut the fuck up! Yeah, fucking misty dudes. Damn misty dudes. I'm mocking them. Get out! Get out! You're the anti-Wheaton. How many is that? CritRoleStats, how many is that? Tell us! I know you've been counting. Go to Vegas! That was seven, by the way. Seven 20s this game. That's with our surprise round? You said we have a surprise round. Oh, we're the only three that aren't surprised. Oh, that sucks. A charisma saving throw? That's not great. And no saving throw bonuses, okay, so that's ten? We've been here before. I did. Ten. This isn't a charm thing? You did two. Yeah. Three v three, man. Battle royale. Let's do this. He's going to call it at eight. He's going to call it. Do we roll initiative, too? We're re-rolling initiative, the three of us? Oh. Help us! I think you guys-- Was that when Kashaw was here? That was Kashaw. Yeah, he cast Turn Undead. Please tell me she trained in cleric. Please tell me she multiclassed. You guys have that holy water, right? Take the damn laser pointer. Good idea! I touched it. I'm sorry! Come on. Do you want Taliesin to lick it? (excited shout) Did you just squeak? (grunts) I rolled a 19. I rolled a 19. What's your AC? It's not a lot of damage, I promise. Oh, see? Even better. Four damage. I'm still doing my granny routine. 12 points? Oh, to Trinket? Oh, I think that hits. 20 total? It's okay. It's not a lot. Nine? Trinket bowling. Hits. Oh, he's going to see if he raged. It's not there anymore. Sorry. I touched it. Yeah! Take the punch! 12. But they take radiant damage. Did I get radiant damage from that push? Oh, I do. 62 hit points. Yeah? (whoosh) Baseball. 17. He's sucking up all the good energy. Don't! 18. (cackles) Failing? Yeah, I touched it. Use the one that I touched. Hits. Oh, sneak attack is going to take me down. Dice rolls get doubled. (laughs) I'm still alive. Sneak Attack. 38? Okay. 43? What was I at just now? 19 hit points. Just the two of us? I actually have disadvantage on dexterity stuff because of corruption. 20 for me. Hopefully. Yeah, I'm down. Nope. Six. I hate these things. Stop hitting yourself! They have to be spells. Come on, take him down. You said 14. It wasn't when he was down. With its withering touch? But you passed your first one. So you have two failures on you? Kill it, Scanlan. Kill it. Again! (laughs) Hi, I'm dead. Nope. I'm stabilized. You do? That's good. I come to consciousness by Scanlan's singing? What? (groans) Wait, how much did you heal us, Scanlan? Yeah. We almost got our ass kicked by ghosts! I might need to burn a Cure Wounds or something. I burned almost all of my hit dice to bring me back up. Guys, I got a little bit of a connection! And gone. That's all. No, we're doing the Christmas Critmas a little bit earlier, so we're going to do the next one before we go on Christmas break, right? That's what I was thinking. Can we move it to the second week? Christmas Critmas is going to be the 10th. He also sang Gogol Bordello's-- MARISHA and See you in two weeks! There will still be a new comic next week to hold you guys over. And playlists. Guess whose playlist is next. You're the last one, right? He does, but he'll go last. Because you always go last. Bye!
