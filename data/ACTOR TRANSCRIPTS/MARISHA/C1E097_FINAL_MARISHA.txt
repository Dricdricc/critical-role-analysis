And finished. Using Backblaze makes me feel so awesome and cool and hip and young and free and attractive and empowered and invincible. It's so easy, even a total jackass could use it. That sounds too low. I'm going to guess $9,000 a month. Five dollars? That's nothing! Oh, me too. Oh, I'm so convinced. But Sam, how do I sign up? One more time. It's Brian Compton from over at Nerdist. (gasps) You got your Geek and Sundry in my Nerdist. You dick! You fucking dick! (chuckles) Yes. Oh, yeah! Yeah. (laughter) Is she down? Can I do it? Can I do the Pocahontas swan dive? I run and cliff dive! (sings) Sail! (laughter) 11. I'm going to hit rock? I go, oops! And can I do a Gust against the cliff wall to push me back a little bit further? Oh, that's good! Just straight wisdom modifier? 20. At the last minute, I'm going to (panicked squealing). And turn into a goldfish. Well, I'm assuming the goldfish would make it easier to hit water. I don't think flying fish actually fly, though. I would just pop back to myself. I wouldn't die. No, I know. No, it's fine! We're gods! That would be kind of amazing. You are lying. You are lying! By hitting rocks? Wait! What? You are lying! Wait! I thought you were trying to make it out like I'd still hit water! This is the best thing that's ever happened! Wait! Was I supposed to turn into a flying creature? And be safe from this? Yeah. I thought I was going to hit water and it would be cool! (screaming) That was higher than I thought! I've been really stressed out here lately, and that might have been very impulsive. And I might have been blowing off some steam. And I'm really sorry! (crying) I thought it was going to be fine! I didn't know there was going to be rocks! Oh? It might have been a last-minute panic. Thanks, that was-- I could go get it now! It's fine. I'm here now. I feel really bad, because-- I feel bad about that. I'm sorry. I can go get the thing. I still have a Beast Shape left. Okay. It's fine. I can go back and get that diamond now. I feel really bad right now! I thought it'd be fun. I haven't had a lot of fun here lately, okay? It felt like the old days of when Vox Machina was back together, because we've been away for a while. It's fine. It's been a lot of responsibility here lately, and a lot of being an adult and so I was like Vox! We're reckless! That's gross. Don't. It felt like blackness. It felt like a lot of adrenaline. And it was super exciting and then next thing I knew, everyone was super concerned about my well-being. No. Did you guys know hitting water and rocks from very high feels like hitting rocks! What's this? I just dove off a cliff, so fuck it at this point. Oh Jesus, 37? I'm fine! Don't worry about me. I'm good! 104. Why? What? Why? I said I'm a golden god! But you know what? I'm still alive; I wasn't entirely wrong. Was I dead? Why are you looking at me like that?! Don't look at me like that! (laughing) It was totally a fail video! I thought I could make it! So I hit the rock. I should have bailed out as a bird. I love how out of everything we've seen, what I just did was apparently the most fucked up. Out of everything that's happened to us, and now we need therapy? Now we need therapy? If I have a piece of one of their belongings. Yeah, that definitely helps, yeah. Do I notice Grog looking uncomfortable? I don't know, do I? No, I look awesome. I'm a little spacey, maybe? For a little bit. It's hard to say. What was his name? Can you tell me anything else about him that would maybe help? What does he look like? All right. Should be enough. I'll do an actual scrying spell. What's that? Hilda? If he is on this plane of existence, I don't know if it's a good sign. But it doesn't mean that he couldn't be lost somewhere else. My spell only extends to this plane of existence but there are many planes. I can try again. Well, that's not good. I don't think so. Do I have any further inkling? Are you insinuating that JB isn't trustful? We like untrustworthy people. None of us are trustworthy; it's good. Oh shit! And steal their plants from outside. Nightshade. He's learning. Business? Did you find a ledger? Is that what you found? What makes them interesting? Are you giving someone parameters by which they don't really have rules to follow? Right. So, it takes a peculiar person to know what's peculiar? Yeah. (death rattle) Not like this. That's actually really accurate. What does a smiley emoji mean? I don't understand. You saw the cloud? What did it look like? The same tower we saw in the Nine Hells? It is a full moon tonight, isn't it? Or was it last night? When was the full moon? Are you getting it over our earpieces? Hi, sorry. I had weird dreams. My dreams are on this plane? I was in Emon not that long ago. I had to talk to them about constructing the crisis orbs. It was a lot of meetings. So many damn meetings. You want to go to the Lyceum? Right now? You want me to send you? Oh yeah. Through the tree? Is there anyone else that needs to go while I'm doing this? Because this is it for the day. Anyone else need to go to Emon? No Kima? I just didn't know if she wanted to go get her. I was just asking. Okay, let's go. I say, (whispering) 'sup, Sun Tree? And then send her through. Okay, bye. What? He's not going to Sam Riegel us again, is he? Because I can't handle that right now. Castle? Oh my god! Coffee sounds amazing to me. Yeah? Three coffees coming right up. I'll be right over. I get three coffees and I head over. Okay, I have two regular, one decaf no foam-- Wait, you think Doty's been boobytrapped? Yeah, what-- I'm sorry. What? Okay, last time I tried to scry on Scanlan, everyone gave me a lot of grief about it. Who is all in the room? Is it the four of us? It'd be better if I had something of Tary's. Hey, Doty. What's up, bud? Okay, I'm going to Professor Xavier this shit and put my hands on Doty's little head. Come here, bend down. Down, Doty. Doty, down. Doty, kneel! Doty, take a knee. Doty, down. You know what? It's fine. And I'm going to do the scry. I don't know what she is making? Don't fuck me, Gil. Oh, okay. Just straight intelligence? 17. She's making arrows? (gasps) (shouting) Bitch! Fucking bitch! God! (shouting) People wonder why we have trust issues! (shouting) It's fucking Hilda! She's a vampire or a werewolf or a lich or something. I don't know. Don't quote me on any of this. She was just like, I don't want your vitals going down and why do people take everything away from us? (yelps) Ow! Okay. I saw Tary. Yeah, he looked unconscious, and it was Hilda, and she had ink-blue, sparkly skin. Ink-blue skin and long silvery hair that was in a top long ponytail thing. Long green-- and she had burgundy armor. He was in a wooden room, somewhere. In a hallway. Her ears were pointy. I know a lot of people have pointy ears, including myself, so I'm not judging anyone who has pointy ears. She sounds like those things you have said before. Yes. The drow, yeah. Like us but blue skin, white hair. And she said she doesn't want him losing too much of his vitality, and that she was going to take him back to where he came from and that he was special. Yeah, she was bringing him home. To his piece of shit family! But why is Tary special? I don't know. This seems like she was interested in something other than his money. Yeah. Do I have any idea of the hallway and the room, of how far away it was? He could be literally anywhere within a hundred-mile radius. Or very far, when jumping off a cliff. Actually, who is good at math? Oh, Percy! You're good at math. Well, when was the last time we saw Tary? Yeah. Exactly. A train traveling by foot. She was making arrows. What was that thing you said? Turns field? And what was the other one? And I couldn't try and do a nature check to try and figure out what direction the wind was coming from when it hit me during the scry? Am I helping you? Are we doing this together? I'm giving you the orb. Yeah, I feel like you did this before. Successfully. I underestimated you. Do you need my help? Okay! And I'm going to try and figure out a discerned direction? Am I with him in the vision? The closest tree that we've ever been to was the one we used to get to Draconia, but I don't know how close Draconia is to him. I can try and scry on where they are and look and see for the biggest tree myself and pop out right there. Can I scry on Deastok? And people that I have connections to. Instead of choosing a creature. But I could try and scry on Tary again and get a nearby tree? Do we have any images or any books here on Deastok that I can look at and then try and scry on, and then after I have the knowledge? It still wouldn't be enough time. We have to bamf there. Yeah, do we know how close Draconia is? Yes, we could. Is that the same day? I thought we slept. So that was today. I could do it again, and then I can Misty Step us, and then I would be out of my 6th, 7th, and 8th-level spells. I would be burning higher spell slots to get us there, but I could do it. You have no books here on Deastok? None in Whitestone? Yeah. (groans) All right, to Draconia! Let's go! Everyone, the Uber will be here in five minutes. We bamfed through the tree, right? That's right. We grew them a forest. Oh my god. That's right. Off the edge of a cliff. (laughs nervously) It's a theme. Oh, this is Deastok. Okay. We can't take him with us. I mean, we would have had to have had-- No, we didn't. Can we still see their tracks if we went back and looked? That would be a ranger question. I could try Commune With Nature, but it only extends for a few miles. How long does it last? Plus, that's a concentration spell. The mist form is my concentration spell, so we should be able to do both at once, correct? If we move quickly while she has her Locate Object on? Penis! (giggling) His Tary! Do we backtrack? But we're over the city. So we theoretically haven't intercepted them yet. But she would still theoretically have his clothing. It would still exist. I do! I can do one of two things. I can either scry on them, or I can do a Commune With Nature spell. All right. Scry! Is the sun in the same direction that we're heading? Okay. And he's conscious. Which is good. He's still alive. Yeah! We won't see his dangling bits. Just the one. You guys, does this make us highway bandits? Are we highway bandits? Oh, cool. Oh wait, did you want someone in the middle of the road? Unassuming, okay. I'm going to go into crow form. (caws) I'm going to aid to her bird lady aesthetic. I follow Pike and peck at her bread crumbs as she crosses the road. I take off in crow form. We're gods, remember? Same as Percy, but as a crow. (caws) I fly down to Pike's shoulder and I go, (caws). I fly over to Percy's shoulder and I go, (caws). I'll go ahead and drop form so I'm not a bird. Oh, I always forget that. I'm so sorry. I'm learning, still. Sorry! Here, let me just-- There you go. I catch up to Tary a little bit and I go, hey! Are you special in some way? Is there something about you that's magical and special? That's true. Is there a reason a vampire would want you? Do you have special blood? Can I look at your eyes? That's true! Do you know anything about your bloodline? Is there something about you? I feel like I have an essence about you now. Okay! Wait, you? That's a lot. That's literally more than my entire tribe owns. I know. We own more than my tribe owns. I know. I will say, Tary, I think you are special. You have very large dangling bits. Along with your earring. Very large other bits. Is it all right? No? I thought that was a compliment. And the last time you spoke with her was when you left, I'm assuming? It's not. Honestly, maybe we should just go talk to her first. Hey, but you're thrifty. You're good. Yes, you are! Taryon, I've seen make amazing things. You can survive. You've been to the depths of the watery abyss. And you've lived, kind of. No! That's not the lesson of the story, you guys! No! Not the lesson, not the lesson we're supposed to take away! I don't have an alternative for the lesson. It's just not the lesson. Yeah, we're gods! Was it 1,000 feet? Yeah, all right. 360 points? Technically, I don't think falling damage counts as weapon damage. I don't know if you can take half damage. Oh, half damage. Well, for anyone who has been asking I am okay. I did not leap off the cliff out of some weird parallel allegory. This was not a cry for help. Not a cry for help. I thought it was going to be dope. That's it. I just thought it was going to be cool as shit, and then it wasn't. Yeah, you'd know if it's a cry for help. In my head, I was an awesome cartoon, and it worked. 100d6 dice, yeah.
