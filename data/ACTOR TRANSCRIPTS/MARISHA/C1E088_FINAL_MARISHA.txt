So wait. They've changed their boxes and their logos. I don't know if you guys noticed. Yeah! Oh, you know what? This was a bad decision. You're correct, this was a bad point of entry. I found a perforated edge. I got Cyborg. Oh, yay. Who wants to trade me a Cyborg? Aw, yeah. There's also something that tells me that I can unlock the mysteries. Secret of the keys. Lootcrate.com/keys. You talk! Let me find it on my-- I don't know where my phone is. The other announcements, I'm trying to navigate Taliesin's phone, because I don't know where my phone is, so this is just going-- This is just going great. Fuck it. We'll do it off the cuff. Wednesday Club. There's also a new Signal Boost, with Stefanie Woodburn and Eric Campbell is out-- ooh, there it is. Merch! Merch. Dice. Are out of stock. Dice are out of stock. Gilmore shirts. The Gilmore shirts are still up, along with socks, vinyl stickers, mugs, patches, bracelets, pins, hats, nail wraps, logo shirts, the disturbingly comfortable 'How do you want to do this?' t-shirt and hoodie, and more, but not really more. That's actually I think everything. (all laugh) Yes! I can officially announce as of yesterday that I am one of the new hosts of Gamestop TV. (all cheer) Yeah, exactly. I'm a little kooky. That's true. Yeah, it's like the ouroboros kinda thing. And last but not least, as always, Talks Machina's live on Tuesday nights at 7PM on Twitch, with the illustrious Brian Foster. And don't forget, 'cause I feel like not a lot of people are doing this really, and I see so much, don't forget to submit your gif and fanart of the week to the contest, and use talksmachina@gmail.com to do that. Put it in the subject, be like, 'contest entry', because that helps people who are poring through your emails. That's it. That's all we have. Done and done. So what time is it here? Oh, it's late. Me neither. Actually, is Uvenda still around? She's still there, are we still in front of her? Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting. I was just curious, I guess, if you had any advice for tomorrow morning. Is there anything I should know in particular about the kraken? Right. You mentioned it being hungry. What does it hunger for? And I imagine it's pretty dark down there. Are there other creatures that live in the rift? All right. Is there a particular creature that you know is good at evading this kraken? All right. Okay. Yes. No, that's-- -- that's not really a beast. I can turn you into-- Well, I know that Taryon and I can alter ourselves into merfolk. And you can also-- how many people can you imbue with your powers? Yeah, could you give Alter Self to others? Definitely. (sings) We are the daughters of Trident! Oh my gosh! Yeah! Yeah! I agree. Let's talk about this over a Heroes' Feast. How's that? Who? What? Sorry, we get carried away. Do you have a training ground? Like an arena that's kind of comparable we can test in tonight? We're leaving in the morning. Do we want to practice now and eat later, or eat now and practice later? Yeah. So fight first. Yeah, we shouldn't swim after eating. Cramps. So we're doing this in the morning, right? We're leaving first thing? No, we're leaving in the morning though, at dawn. At dawn, we swim. Then I'm going to go ahead and cast Water Breathing on all of us now, because it lasts for 24 hours. Up to ten, I believe. I think it's up to ten. Let me double-check. I'm pretty sure it's ten. Ten. Willing creatures. Yeah, go find out, that's why we're here, man. We could be great whites. We could be sharks. I can also change us whenever we feel like being something else. It just takes a turn. Rock it like an electric eel! Sorry. Tary? Respect. Can I imbue one of your mystical coins with one of my spells that we give to other people or is that kind of your thing? Oh, sure, yeah. I'm sorry. I'm farsighted. So sorry. I did not mean any offense. I mean, you're gonna take full credit for it later, aren't you? All right. No, that's fine. I mean-- you know-- (laughs weakly) Moving on. Back to planning. I could give you an animal form. Shark? I've gotta give you something kind of real. Kind of beastly. But it is challenge rating four or lower, which is awesome. That's cool. You keep your bonuses. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, we're still underwater, right? (garbled underwater speech) With Animal Shapes? So, you can't benefit from your equipment. And it's our movement speed, which isn't very fast. Correct. Could killer whales give us a movement speed of 60 swim feet? He was into sharks, but he has something against whales. They're faster. Yeah, they are. It says in the book that they are definitely faster. You guys were down with manatees, but have something against killer whales? I feel like our priorities are off. I mean, if we use Pass Without A Trace, right? I mean, Pass Without A Trace should still work underwater. If we're all something super stealthy, we move super fast, get there, and get out. It seems like it's Marianas Trench levels. Seems like-- Here's my thought. Certain of us are gonna be better under the water with our natural forms and some of us aren't. Half of us go... (laughs) Half of us are animals. The other half can ride them in our Alter Self forms like a SeaWorld show. Because I can Alter Self at will and you have to take a spell slot, or can you do it at will? Yes. It means one of us might have to borrow your bag of holding. Tary, you had a bag of holding, right? All right! The lodestones in. No, you cannot keep them. Run. Yeah. Yes. It's true. Tigers aren't that bad. Well, if you drop back down to zero hit points, you'll revert back to your normal form, being able to water breathe, full hit points. Yes. Uh-huh. 90. 90. I don't know if there's anything else better. I also don't want you tired tomorrow. There's something that I want to try really quick, if you guys could back up or maybe get out of the water. I want to see if I can cast spells underwater. I also want to see what lightning does, so if you don't want to get electrocuted. I love that this is all under the assumption that we just had this planning sesh underwater. Oh, we're treading. Okay. You wanna see? I'm gonna tread back from Grog, go underwater, and I'm gonna do a Call Lightning bolt. See what happens. Yeah, that's what I was curious about. That's exactly what I wanted. All right, then how about this? I take out my Spire and I do a Chain Lightning out of the Spire. Okay. So I can cast out of the Spire. And-- cool. While I'm under there, I want to Beast Shape into a killer whale. I goose Grog a little bit from underneath. It's fine. (laughs) (laughs) Uh, yeah. That definitely hits. (laughs) (groans) Oh, no. Oh, no. I drop form out of shame. (all laugh) Well, I'm in like a tank. Which is even worse, I know! This feels tactless, I'm out! (all laugh) That's a good point! Well, if I do Alter Self-- Let me actually try that. I Alter Self. To be able to give myself-- Gills, and like, fins and stuff, and then-- now can I cast? Yeah, what about my Water Breathing-- -- we should still be able to talk? Okay, but you can't go (garbled underwater noises). I think it's a potion of waterbreathing. Could I speak into the jug-- clearly. What is a diving bell? Killer whales? And-- all right. Who's whales, who's riders? Rider? Trinket could be a whale. I thought you were being a rider. Yeah. All right, let's go eat food. Yup. Hot fudge sundae. 2d10-- -- which I will roll for you right now, and we-- both are cocked. (singsong) Landed on the side. That one-- is that still cocked? God damn it. Shut up! An extra 11. Wisdom saves. No fear, no poison, 2d10. Oh, that will be super frustrating if we just took all that time. Or if this is one of those-- Solved-- making problems complicated for five years. Yeah. That's great. It does. We totally didn't. We should have asked what equipment was available. (all laugh) I feel stupid. Oh yeah, and that will immediately go away-- As we go underwater. If you Alter Self, right? Can you make yourself darkish? Oh, okay. Well, if it's dark-- So much fun. Yeah, I like, I like the latter. Malaise of fear. While they're winding down, can I sneak away and see if I can find Uvenda? I turn to her guards and say, do I wake her up? Does she not like being-- I don't want to be rude! But I kinda need to talk to her and I'm only here for a few more hours, and I-- Ah, that's how you do it. Hi. Uh, yeah. I was just curious. I'm so sorry, first off-- You mentioned that there were only remnants of my mother that came back. Was she defeated by the kraken, or do you think this was from another means? Do you have any more information on her? And you're sure of this? This is what the kraken does to people? Hm. I was just wondering. If there was any other potential explanation or--? How long ago was this? Really? All right. That's not that long, really. Did she stay long? All right. I was just curious. Thank you. Did you keep anything? From what you found? Okay. Well, I appreciate that much. Thank you for doing that. Oh. It's part of the duty. Well, I should be getting my rest. Yeah, big day! Swimming! Lots of calories! I'm gonna go now. All right, bye. Goodnight. Did you just follow me? Were you following me just now? Oh! All right, okay, yeah. Sorry. No, I'm good, I'm good. I'm great. Yeah. A lot, yeah. A lot riding on this, but-- A little surreal that we're here. Yeah. What? I'm just glad I have you all. He was a good man. Uriel was also blinded by his unknowance of a lot of problems, so I just hope I don't follow in his footsteps in that regard. Thank you. For believing in me. Anyway, we should get some sleep. It's a big day tomorrow. Heehee, hee. I pet them a little. Oh god, that weird poetry! (all laugh) Is he God? That's so cool! Oh, I find Uvenda. I take some time in my morning prep to do a little meditation, and I take my flame hands and I do some like, traditional Ashari war paint, kinda thing, going on. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Mm-hm. As long as he doesn't hit zero hit points, then he won't turn into a bear. But he has water breathing! As a whale. That's me. Well, if you cast Pass Without a Trace, it's a concentration spell-- Is Alter Self a concentration spell? Oh. I could cast Pass Without a Trace, though. I did bring it today. I could-- yeah. Wait. One. Two. Right. Animal Shapes takes my concentration, so I can't do that. But you could cast it-- I can go ahead and cast Animal Shapes on her, but it takes a turn, a round, for me to-- an action to change her into something else, so can I cast it on her, but leave her as Vex for now? No, I know. Okay. Never mind. 'Cause we need Pass Without a Trace for her, right? You can cast the coin. Okay. All right. Uvenda, these beads. Can you guys also track where we are based on them? No. All right. I go ahead and I Druidcraft one of my bark bracelets to put around her. For scrying, if you need it. Durent? So someone you would find at Venice Beach. Are you gonna be with us the whole time, or are you just getting us there? Of course. There's doors to the other planes. That's our people's job. I go in first. Oh, right. Are we doing this now? Animal Shapes last for 24 hours. Yeah, he's gonna be showing us the stones first, right? So yeah. Jesus. I go in first. I can't-- nope, he's a construct. The portal to the other dimension is underwater and through a rift. You're gonna have an excellent book on the mating habits of seagulls when you get back. Keyleth goes up and touches one and meditates on it for a second. Really. Are the throat beads green? Do they look similar? Do the beads tend to react when they get closer to the lodestone? I turn to Durent. Whereabouts do they tend to be found? The lodestones? All over? Buried. Magnetic. Percy, do you have a compass? Really? You don't have a compass. Really? Really, you have a compass? Will you keep that handy, you know? Sure. And a hula shirt. I tap it, because I've seen other people do that, and I feel like that's what you do with compasses. Ahh! Do you want to be the compass man? Are you gonna man the compass? Be navigation? The navigator. So when we get through the void, and maybe we can do a Locate Object and then Pass Without a Trace, and then I'll cast Animal Shapes, and then we go. But it lasts for ten minutes. Yeah. I'll fail?! Did you just say I'll fail? Okay, bye! Jesus. Hi, countdown. The map? Yes I just noticed it, yeah. Ooh. Elemental? You'll definitely find elementals because they're definitely here. A mineral? (laughs) They're in the walls, they're in the goddamn walls! Do I see that? That's actually insanely helpful. (garbled voice) No! Most do have blindsight or echo-location, so they-- Might not be good for us. Angler fish, yeah. Mm-hm. Do we have a few minutes? I can do a quick Locate Object spell, see if we're headed in the right direction if you wanna-- Can I assist her in any way? All right. Wow. You know, Taryon just gave me an idea. Thank you for your infinite wisdom, Taryon. We might be able to use a Daylight spell as a distraction worst case scenario, because I can place it somewhere and then leave it. Yeah. I can leave it. As a distraction. I don't wanna do it right now, but I'm just throwing it out there-- That's a hundred percent true, we've done that before. Just keep that in mind. All right. Yeah. All right. Okay, we have a direction, are we ready? Let's see how we feel. I'll go ahead and do Pass Without A Trace on us and we'll try and move in the direction that she called. Whenever he's ready. He does have Water Breathing cast on him. I mean, he's a bear. Yeah. (laughs) Oh no. No, I'm doing Pass Without A Trace. I'm crying so hard. Oh wait, we're all doing them. Oh, that's good! That's good. Yeah, 34. Rogues! They get the job done. Oh my god. (Darth Vader-esque breathing effect) Hunt some scallops. Calamari. Some Grog aioli, a lil bit of mayo, lemon. I stand watch while they do this and just look for any movement. Don't fuck me, Gil. 25. No, 27. Sorry. I come over the intercom and say, Be very quiet. Very still. Very slow. Oh, son of a fuck, you don't. Motherfucker. Still keeping an eye on the dark figure. I'll watch. Hit! Yeah, I keep an eye on the big figure the whole time. Come on. Thanks, Gil. Do I do that too or no? I'm looking. No stone. Compass? Can I kind of start splitting the difference in case anything bad happens? Just very slowly. 31 stealth. (gasps) That's your stealth? (all laugh) My god, 45. And the compass. Yeah, hey Vax, oh fuck, it's a rock again. Yeah, it lasts for a while. Oh Jesus, I thought it was a one at first. Richard Dreyfuss in Jaws. Oh man, come on. No, you are lying to me, you are lying! No! No, Tary! And I just say, red alert, red alert, think we got a kraken coming. Think the weather is calling for a kraken tonight. Please tell me you guys found a lodestone. Did you guys find it? Did you find it? Please tell me you found it. Vex, Vex, let's do the Daylight. Red alert, red alert, Daylight! Taryon, dig up the lodestone immediately-- Fuck me! No! Fuck! Natural 20! That's true, not used to bright-- Just like, fwoomp, towards him. Over him, away from him. Towards him, yeah. 22. Ah. Worked out yesterday. Ouch. He's like a delightful Creole dish. Don't hurt it! Someone find the third fucking lodestone. How far away am I from Vex? Let me move towards-- I say, Vex! Huh? Yeah. I can do that at will. Enough to see Vex. Vex? Daylight arrow! Now! And I prep my Daylight spell for whenever she draws her arrow. And I wait for as soon as I see the tip of her arrow to go. And then I say, dear god, please, Taryon, find the other lodestone. Don't kill the kraken! Fuck! (all laugh) These things! (garbled) Use the compass. Lodestone. (garbled) Coldstone Creamery. Go for the raspberry cheesecake. No. Plus a d4, plus a d4. Using the people-killer-- not bad. Not bad, people-killer. 19. 19. I said 19. And that took-- (laughs) "#blessed" Daylight on the tip of that arrow. Pew, pew, pew. It's a Hail Mary pass. Daylight. I've totally cast Daylight on an object before. SAM and But I can do that, right? 'Cause I did that with Grog and his bull helmet. Over on the arrow. Like a flare-- I don't know if that's allowed, but I know we've done that in the past. Come on. Come on! Sure. Don't kill it, don't kill it. These violet candies are delicious. Just delicious. Don't worry about it. Don't kill it, don't kill it, don't kill it. You hate fish! I'm so sorry, you're so right! Holy shit. Yeah. That's not cool. At all. (sings "Hammer Time") Yeah. Spells suck. They're great. Get 'em undone. Get them undone. I hadn't gotten that far. Give me a week. I knew that's what you were going to say. So all my friends are still grappled. Yeah, I'm going to cast Locate Object, see if I can find that third lodestone. They're fine. You're fine. You're level 16, motherfuckers. You're fine. I want to find the lodestone. Locate Object. I'm sorry. Your hand is lateral. Towards the way your hand is going. Okay, I'm going to use my Alter Self swim speed. And swim that direction as far as I can. Do I get a better location on it? I'll double my speed. Can I do another investigation check? Is it near me? Okay. As a bonus action, who's near me? Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Party members. Okay. I'm going to do-- you're fine, right? You're great. I'm going to do a Grasping Vine and see if I can get Taryon out of the kraken's grasp with Grasping Vine. A lot of big words. Can I get it kind of towards that-- sorry, deal with me. This guy here? Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Taryon. Strength? People-killer. People-killer! That's good! My strength? Oh, just my modifier? Wise as fuck, motherfucker! That was a 15. 26! (yells) Okay, but I'm still-- lodestone's, over here! And that's all I get. All of us? Seven. That definitely hits. That really-- that hurts, 21 points, I'm at 91 so 21 puts me to 70, right? Yeah. What? Who's not grappled? (Southern accent) The later the hour gets-- The longer-- mom's been in town for a while. Laughing at your accent. A little. Yeah. No, no, I cast Grasping Vine, which is technically a bonus action. It should not impede with my concentration spell, so we should still have Pass Without A Trace, correct? Nope! I cast Locate Object-- Totally ruined that! Sorry! Nope. Lodestone-- Yep, podcast coming to the alpha network. Project Alpha. Big money no whammies, big money no whammies! Just get out, man. It's a big-ass kraken, though, it's not bad. Yeah yeah yeah! Come on. Come on. You're still blessed yeah? Inside of it, yeah yeah yeah. Please don't kill the kraken! Gonna have a really hard time explaining that to my ancestors. That's not-- no. I could do that! -- we can resuscitate the kraken. Find the lodestone. I did tell you to find the lodestone. Can I say anything to him in the process? I can? I say (garbled) Lodestone! Right there! No, this is the next one! This is the next one, I found it, where I am! I'm right there. That's me, the lodestone is over here somewhere. (sing) That's me in the spotlight-- I'm still grappled. Hm, hm hm hm. So I'm still attached? Hm. I turn to Vax, grappled, and I say Lodestone!, and I point with the best direction that I can with my remaining-- A one. Who's still grappled? Taryon and Percy? And Grog. Okay-- I look at the twins, and I say "Lodestone! There-ish!" Lodestone! And I do Control Water? And I'm gonna redirect flow, and I'm gonna push all of us-- I don't give a fuck, we'll be fine, in this direction. You see my laser? I want to point us away. So I'm gonna redirect flow and go poof! And push us away from the lodestone, in the direction of everyone else. I can redirect the current of the ocean for a temporary amount of time. All of us, just, me and the kraken, and I guess everyone who's still grappled by him are going this way. Vax and Vex are probably still away. I'm going (sound effects) Roll a d20 and add my wisdom modifier? I've got advantage on that, right? Because of Heroes' Feast? Ooh! That's good! That's a 17! Plus 11, eight, 28! Ooh! 28! Fuck yeah it is! Did he lose his grip, come on! Wait, who? Me? LIAM and Not Vex and Vax? Okay. Get the lodestone! Bathroom, I'll be back. Not concentration, bonus action spell. That sucks. You know, things that the Player's Handbook does not tell you. I just want to point that out. Conjure Woodland Beings, it says right here-- Hang on. The DM has creature statistics. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group. You know, I will say, it's a little bullshit. It's a little bullshit. Yeah. Yeah. Well, okay, so us as killer whales, we're challenge rating three. Except none of us are killer whales. You get one fey creature-- They're friendly, they roll initiative-- And they sing like Disney characters. Basically, Tangled. But not. You know, but like for real, they never tell you the best creatures. You know, that's a good point. (gasps) Is that a thing? Thank you, Google. And you can get a hunter shark-- -- which is a challenge rating of two. Hunter Shark! And a hunter shark has blood frenzy, which means the shark has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that does not have all of its hit points. We're those assholes right now. I just wanna point that out. Just so long as we don't kill it. Just don't kill it. Please don't kill it. I'm sorry, I just saw a flash of my future. I could, yeah. Did you roll both 16s? You did. They're both 16s. Oh! That's good. Sorry, this thing looks very red to us. This thing. It's not red, but on camera it looks very red to us. This thing. You're so grappled again, aren't you? You spent your entire action getting away from him. Fuck this. Holy shit. Okay, hang on. My Control Water spell has a concentration and I create a current-- In a direction for several minutes. Well, that's just great. That's wonderful. Motherfucker. Yeah, I mean, yeah. Am I about to be swallowed with Grog? 22 points, you said? 48 points. Do I see Grog? Can I like-- a free action to be like, Grog, I'm in the kraken! as a free action? Grog! (gurgling noises) Or like-- hands? Lodestone! Lodestone! Dig. Dig. Dig, dig, dig. You're so good, you're so good. No, you're great, you're great. You're hot. You're great. You're good. You're warm. You're finding that stone. More than us. More than us. More than us. Which, I have Planeshift if all goes terribly wrong. That's true. Grog! Grog! And I reach out. He's saying. Do I feel him? I still have Control Water. As a concentration. Yep, you're not wrong. Come on. Concentration? Which I have advantage, oh, I'm a Warcaster! That's 16. No, I'll take the 16. What? Okay. 22! Okay. And I find Grog. And I Control Water. Is it watery in this? No water, though? I can't like jettison myself out of this guy's mouth? All right. Okay. No. That's fine. Okay. We have oil. Right? I tell Grog, I say, Hold on, and I cast a Fireball right in front of us, to try and jettison ourselves out with my Spire. With my Spire of Conflux I go (explosion) and try and give this motherfucker the worst heartburn he's ever experienced. I'm making a dex save? At disadvantage. At disadvantage? That was eight. Plus dex, which is five, so that's-- Plus blessed! #blessed. Ooh, that's good, that's good. That's 13, so that's 18! It doesn't say. Which is 20. If I'm fully equipped. On myself. I will be exceedingly angry if I have to-- I don't care about that, I care more about the kraken at this point. This is my life's work. Literally Keyleth's life work. Okay, five, six, seven, eight, nine, plus four, which is 13, plus another six which is 16, 19, and a six which is 25. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. I'm sorry. You said 8d6? It's actually 29 points. Please don't kill this thing. Who? Him? No, Grog! 18 points, that I can deal with. Wait, plus 25? So 25 plus 18 which is what-- 43 points of damage! I am alive. But Grog and I are out? Do I still have a bonus action? I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself. At second level. Sorry. That's two. Because I'm hurting. Oh, I know. Four, five, plus-- six. Yep, that ends my turn. So glad I healed myself. 19 points. Seven points. Even though there's my Control Water current going outward? Which lasts for ten minutes! I haven't broke concentration-- I saved for it. I already saved for it while I was inside of him. I can save again. It's not terrible. My wisdom-- 19. Not as good. Plus bless, which is good. Wait, what was that? That was three, thank you, three. Sorry, constitution. 16! 16! Jeez, guys. Gil. Gil bought us kraken. Blame Gil. Don't fuck me, Gil! Player-killer, not great. Seven. I'm unconscious. Keyleth is unconscious. That's all three, right? Three? We have all three? Also did my Control Water-- Yeah Trinket! TALIESIN and You know, they get it. It's so close, I know. That's good, though. Yeah? It allows you to alter yourself based on what you chose, which is give you gills and fins-- Within moderation. Healing points? I get 12. Yeah, yeah. Gets a little bit of a nosebleed. Not sure why. All that inspiration. Yeah, I'm just like a poodle over a pool right now, just doggy paddling instinctually. Do we have the lodestones, do we have all of them? And I do Animal Shapes and I turn all of us to-- who's grappled? A lot of us. Right? I'm going to turn us into like little electric eels. Maybe it's because we made that joke earlier, I don't know. Is that bad? Is that bad? I just want something that is going to swim fast and then we all-- Swim. We slip out of its grasp and swim to the portal. To the portal! And we go. There is a water snake, which is kinda what I'm basing this off of. The giant constrictor snake-- Has blindsight-- ugh. Okay, okay, okay. Most are and hunter sharks are 40-foot swim speed, killer whales are 60-foot swim speed-- But they're bigger motherfuckers, so can we do a giant eel that's got a swim speed of 40 feet? Ooh I wanna be that! Look, I'm bound by what the Player's Handbook gave me! So-- So I'll go-- Ah, fuck, whales are fucking big, though! Whales are big. So I'll be eels with a swim speed of 40 feet? So we can slip out? Well, that's going off of a snake speed. It's a land snake. Okay, but whales are 60 feet, sharks are 40 feet. That's our problem. Yeah. We'd be slow to be snakes, but more possibly-- (yells) We're going to be eels! That's what I said at first! Swim, 30 foot! I wanna use a statistic for a snake, but swim speed, fuck! I'm trying to be elusive here! Fuck. Go, go, go, go. Oh, god. Double movement. I don't know what that did. I did okay. And we're still blessed. Okay, that went off the rails. That's not bad. Okay, okay-- What? (sings) Shocking like electric eels. Sweet! No, run, run, run. Get out, get out, get out. Electric eels. We are electric eels. Dumb idea that worked out. It's one of those mega water balloons. You take its physical-- Yeah. Wait, why is his eel form destroyed? Yeah, all right. All right. "All right" is not the statement of someone who's arguing. "All right" is literally "all right." That's fine. Sure. Did you skip me? I thought I was after Vax? Okay. I confused you with Percy. Okay. Who's still an eel? Don't kill it. Ooh. Oh boy. Oh that's good. 15. Is this considered a spell? Okay. Don't fuck me, Gil! What am I doing? Dex save? 22 for-- (gasps) Not great. 21 total for me? I'm unconscious. Is that what you needed all the d8s for? Give me my d8s back. (all laugh) Yeah I kind of went unconscience. Unconscious. Yeah, you know. It's Gil's fault. No! No, no, no. Get us out. Get us out. Leave it alone. We have all the lodestones, right? Yes! I literally have! Fuck! Who is closest by the portal? There's an ink cloud? I got rid of that, right? Okay. Oh, dear god. I'm gonna Control Water again. Yeah, I'm casting it again. Who's around me? I am going to-- -- push us towards the portal with Control Water. Just (sound of rushing water). Yeah. Control Water towards the portal. Is there anyone still held on by the kraken? Vax is still grappled? Okay. I'm gonna take a Grasping Vine, I'm gonna grab Vax and yank him towards me from this-- who's got the thing? From that-- that one closest by. This one. I can't see that? Can I see this red thing? Can I see this? Can I see this red thing in front of me? Okay. I'm gonna drag him closer in. I wanna drag-- send him this way. [no audio] Beyond it. Okay, Tary-- where's Tary? Well, bullshit all the way around. Then I just swim desperately, doggy paddle towards the portal. There's-- what's left? All right. I'll killer whale towards the portal. Where am I? All right. All right. All right. (LAURA laughs) It is very hard to see from what this is-- Sure. I'll go killer whale. Yeah. That was true. It's fine. And all of my Control Water direction is towards the portal. Okay. Sure. Is that including me? 21. Who failed? Wait, who failed? Yeah. No. Get out, get out, get out, get out. Alter Self. Alter Self. Alter Self. Go, go, go out-- Out! You're out! But you made it! That's good! Just tell 'em, tell 'em Percy! Tell Doty! That's not true. What? No, he's just inside. Does Keyleth see this? Go for it, that's exactly what Grog would do. We can't fucking kill it, you guys, don't kill it. They won't grow back. Don't die. Who's grappled and who's closest to the portal? I still have Control Water up, correct? Taryon and Grog are both grappled? And I'm free underneath them? Okay. I used Alter Self originally, correct? Alter Self. So I still have all my Beast Shaping, correct? Okay. Huh? I didn't use Alter Self to do that? Oh, okay cool. Sorry, sorry, sorry, I meant, sorry, I meant-- Animal Shapes. No? I've used Animal Shapes to everybody? I used that to me, right. All right. Cool, cool, cool. Cool. Okay. I'm gonna try to get Grog out of the grasp again with my Grasping Vine. Bonus action first. See if I can-- Okay. He's right here? Correct? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I wanna be over here-ish. Yeah. It's hard 'cause I don't literally have access beyond this rock. On the other side of that, closest to the portal? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's what I want. Yeah. Don't fuck me, Gil! What is that? What is that? Not-- What is that? What is that? That is a 17? Sorry, I don't want to feel insane. Plus my wisdom modifier. (nervous laugh) 30-- sorry, 28! 28! Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, not a saving throw, so 20-- 17 plus six, which is 25? 23? 17 plus five-- six? It's a 30-foot range, with another 30-foot range coming from me. So 60 foot total. 30 foot. Okay. And then I have my action, and my movement. And I'm a normal person right now, or am I a whale? Okay. I wouldn't be able to cast the spell. Yeah. Yeah, I would definitely drop the form. And then I have another spell. Correct? Second level or lower. So-- fuckin' A, this is complicated. Okay. Then I would cast, oh, shit. I got Grog out. Who's almost dead? Yeah, I don't know if I can do anything about that right now, though. I can cast a second level or lower-- oh my god, this is awful. All right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll heal myself-- sorry, for another Healing Word level two-- last level two spell. I'm gonna move-- no, I'm gonna stay close towards the kraken. Yeah. Where am I? You're actually not even on the screen. I can see your fingers-- let me move closer towards the kraken and towards the portal. And that's all I'll do. And I heal myself, sorry, level two-- -- which is 2d8. Healing Word. Sorry. 2d4. That's-- both ones. That sucks. One plus six-- Natural one. 13? I had 12 hit points, so I'm unconscious. I-- for 12. And now I'm zero. And then I healed seven. And I healed seven 'cause I rolled two ones. So-- no, no, no, wait-- I rolled two ones on my d4s. And I have-- -- a plus six, so that's actually eight. Do I have one hit point left? Is that accurate? I'm at zero. God f-- damn it. Get out. Out. Get out. Get out. You're all-- I've got him. You've got three lodestones. You and him. That was me. God damn it. Yeah, you can get Vax out. To the door, Taryon. Don't kill the kraken. Yeah. Plus my constitution? Three. Immediately? Seven points? (gasps) (garbled) Okay. Get out, get out, get out. I'll just go back to doggy paddling. Oh, thank God. Fucking hell. Okay. But he's out of the kraken, he's out of the kraken. You have a bag, right? But you can swim out-- oh. But you can double your movement. What what what no? No? Nothing? No luck? Come on. Raven Queen shit? Nothing? Oh my God. Who do I see? Vex is grappled, Vax is dead, and then there's me. How close am I to Vex and Vax? I'm ten feet from each? Can I swim with my Alter Self, grab both of them-- Can I do that? Can I grab both of them? With my swim speed-- -- Alter Self. Yeah? In between them. No I've got Alter Self! I've got Alter Self! Come on, man, do I have Vex-- 30. (gasps) And I cast, I cast Plane Shift and I get us out of here-- Sorry, everyone else. Me, Vex, and Vax-- It's you and Taryon left. Get the fuck out. Back to Vesrah. We're out of the portal. Wait, who? Who? Wait, Grog is dead? I thought you said death. Wait, wait, are you grappled? Nobody else is grappled. (groans) Can't do anything So both Vex and Tary are unconscious? You're unconscious? Wait, who's unconscious? We need, he has a purse. Get out, get out. Get out, get out, get out. You still have the coin, right? Come on, Percy. Grog. He's grappled? Come on, through the door! He projectile vomits! Come on! He's still fucking dead! He's still fucking dead. God! And all of the guilt complexes. Who's still alive? All of us, but Vax and Taryon?
