Yeah. [hat plays tinny, high-pitched "Scotland the Brave"] That was not what I was expecting! Just like Fjord. (laughter) I'm going to go to Caleb when he gets back. (knocking) Caleb! Caleb! Caleb! Oh, right! It doesn't drown, it's amazing. It's like it's magic or something. We had good times. Do I?! Can you do me a favor? Pocket owl. Right next to my bacon. I got this red feather from Nila-- and I don't know, when she handed it to me, she was like-- very deliberate on how she handed it to me. Will you just see if it's magic? Yeah. Tie it to my staff. I'm not disappointed. I'm not disappointed! I'm-- bye. I'm going to go to bed. That was the cutest. Put in under my-- okay. To Darktow? 14 days?! Oh shit! I would like that very much. What was that cooper position? Barrels? I already know how to make a barrel. Making barrels. Performance? I have a jeweler's kit. (pigeon cooing) Beau made jewelry. (pigeon cooing) I want some magic tattoos! Holy shit. Aw shit. I run in with a keg of black powder that I've been building. (shouting) Are we fighting?! (shouting) Is this a fight? (shouting) Who's trying to punk our ass? Okay! All right, I've got five pounders, eight pounders, 12 pounders, short fuses and a 20 pound keg. What are we doing? What's going on? Okay! Okay. So we're not fighting? Can somebody please tell us what the fuck is going on? Just for visuals. Way cheaper. Uh-huh. Because books are heavy. Yeah? Okay. And you want no violence here whatsoever? What's Captain Avantika doing right now? Yeah, absolutely. We're trying to go with Squalleater people. Waldok? Ipess or Waldok? Where is the captain's quarters? Be right back. I'm going to go into the captain's quarters. I'm looking for any type of important paperwork, correspondence, what these guys are, traveling logs. And books! Frumpkin, what are you doing? I put Frumpkin on my shoulder. I rolled a natural 19, so 24. Anything of interest? I'm going to immediately look around. Do I see any of the safes where you would hide a guarded package in here? All right. I go meet Fjord and Norgul. Nope! Ipess. That's who's with us, I go meet them. Oh, an entire inventory of the ship. That looks interesting! Who wants to ask about that? I grab the whole chest. Is it heavy? I grab the whole chest. (grunting) Yeah, that's pretty good. Feel pretty proud of that. Do you think this is the shipment? Think this is that? Would I deduce this is that, or no? There's a different package here. I crack my knuckles behind Fjord. I feel deeply capable, but I feel deeply capable. Yo, Yasha! Oh sorry. (shouting) Yasha! Come here. Think the secret package is a person. Think there's a person, think he's the secret package because he's on this ledger and it's different handwriting. Anyway, let's go find the person. Super on edge and guarded. Darkvision goggles. Okay. Thank you. I will take it. Oh my god, I rolled a three and a four. Seven. I can't see shit, but I don't trust it. You know, maybe if I readjust. Let me just close my eyes for a second. Okay, why don't you try? You've got to test on somebody. Like, you've been abducted, congratulations. Plug! Sorry. Actually, not sponsored. He's looking through Frumpkin. Oh my god, I don't know if I trust Gil. I'm sorry, Gil, but I don't trust you. 18. I'll take that 18. Okay, I'm going to come up and I'm going to parkour off of one of the crates and I'm going to try and come down and I want to nail him in the temple and try and do a stunning strike. First, I'm just going to try and hit him. While I'm doing this, I'm going to be like Frumpkin, help! Okay, 19? I'm using my elbow. Fucking balls, why does this keep happening to me? Five points of damage on that first one, and I'm going to do a stunning strike. It needs to be garbage. Nope. 14. Hang on, wait. It's my proficiency bonus plus my-- because I was afraid that I had been fucking this up-- plus my wisdom, which is-- (counting) 14. Nope, it's still 14. Pop, pop. Do it again. First hit, 20. Bullshit damage. Six. You said his con was good? One more time. Ki point. He's stunned! My bonus action-- Oh wait, he's stunned! Yeah, that's an 18 to hit, a natural 18. And another goddamn one! Five. I'm going to look at Frumpkin again and be like Caleb, if you're watching, I don't trust Avantika? That's probably all I can say. I just turn to Fjord and go Frumpkin listens to my commands! Nice. He's grappled? I'm going to say Look, me and this guy have been trying to be better about not hurting people. You know, we're trying to watch out for one another. The truth is, we want to talk to you. We're going to get answers from you. It's your choice if it's going to take us beating them out of you, or if you just want to give them to us. So I'm not going to hit you. Just know, if I feel like you're lying to me, I'll punch the living shit out of you, and then you're going to tell me what I wanted to know anyway. Understood? Yeah. We're not murder monsters! I move to it. Before I open it, I'll look at him and go Is there a trap in this damn thing? If you're lying to me, I'll slit your throat. I open the crate very carefully. I pull that out of the crate. It's locked. Hey, Frumpkin, if you're listening, can you have Caleb tell Nott to come down here, please? I look at the guy. Is this trapped? What's your name? I'm trying real hard right now. Like, so hard. We're trying real hard, man. Like, actively trying real hard. Soma. See, now was that so hard? Did that take you being fucking rude? Oh, hey, Cad! Will you go get Nott? Oh, jeez. I'll go get Nott. Nott! Come here. I think Frumpkin really likes me. We had a bonding moment. Frumpkin took care of me and protected me. Okay, bye. And we go. No. (whispering) But we found someone and something. We like to have fun at our job. Nice plate armor, by the way. (clicks tongue) It looks expensive. I toss the box to Nott. Catch! We want you to open it. Fucking open it. SAM; Open! What, that you were-- We already threw him money, which means you're going to tell us who paid you. Come on, man, don't make us do this the hard way. We're trying to be good. Who paid you? (deep breath) Come on. What was the agency you sub-contracted from? I know how this shit works. Thank you. As well as the fact that you spit in my face. I'm going to leave that here. We're going to cross out these doors. None of it happened. Oh, yeah! Do you want us to do that? Like Ooh! Ah! You got me in my kidney! That's rare. As we're walking over, I whisper to Fjord and I say Avantika's going to want the paintbrush. Avantika's going to want to know about that paintbrush. Yeah, but Bouldergut was there. Bouldergut saw everything, so unless we want to bribe Bouldergut-- I have to pee, too. That's so cute. Where's Bouldergut to me? Okay. One less pirate and one less shipper trying to prove himself a hero. Thought he could stand up to the lot of us. Well, we didn't kill him, but we definitely embarrassed him thoroughly, something that I find some men find worse than death. I heard there were some very good tropical fruits, super rare, in this crate. Based on what I found, (clicks). Good meal later on. I slip her 30 gold. I'm not-- I'm trying to-- Oh my god, are you serious? Oh, is it? That's still not great. That brings me to an 11? It is a one? Nope, it's a one! Fucking hole in my pouch. Shit, how did that-- Thank you. Good show everybody, everybody great time. Just wanted a round of applause. Captain Tusktooth! Sorry. Quartermaster Tusktooth, formerly captain for us. Anyway, it was a good day. What are people doing? We act casual. I, sensing my biff, casually I turn to Ipess and say Hey man, great work down there. How great was that? So impressive, right? I fucking-- right? Saw that adrenaline pumping. Anyway, good day, man. I go downstairs. I'm trailing them. I try to find Caleb. They do that. Genuine question have you been telling this story the entire time I've been gone? That's great. You know what? I have something I think that you would be deeply interested in, maybe. I didn't. Fucking, goddamn it. I didn't find fucking books. Okay, books, cats, I get it, that's so good. Love your fascination of both the most boring things that I can think about, including books and cats. But let's go look at something awesome. Just keep your mouth shut for like 30 damn seconds. Follow me. We bring him to them. Hi. Shh, come in, shut up. Did anyone follow you? Shank shank shank! (laughter) Do the thing. Figure it out. Yes. Just not about cats and books. In the meantime, I'm like Oh my god! So, what happened? Is it like a tattoo? When are you going to do a tattoo on me? I opened the box. This is the paintbrush and the ink. Caduceus detected magic, and it was glowy. That's what I'm saying, so I need to figure out what it is. I've had an idea. For just a little bit. So this is going to be stupid. You're not, fucking-- The Not There Fairy? Not there! I have this idea, because Molly, on the back of his coat, his neck, his tattoo? On the back of his tattoo, he had an all-seeing eye, and I just, I don't know, I thought it was really cool, I feel like it could be cool to have it on my back, right below my neck. Yeah. Oh, yeah, maybe it would, like I stole it from him? Yeah, you know, he's dead, so, what's he going to do? We'll do that later. Yes! I was so hoping for this! Isn't that an old Chinese folklore, a magic paintbrush? It's the magic paintbrush. There'll be real dicks! Haha, dick joke. This is a real conversation we actually need to have, with the entire group present, speaking of. Except for Fjord. Yeah, I feel like before port. We need a plan before port. I don't want to waste that. We could just steal a ship. Fjord. Oh, I was going to say I go get Fjord. Casually, but like I don't want to interrupt, like a cocktail party. I do the When you're ready, just (clicks tongue). Just where we are. Technically anyone can use a shield, but if you're not proficient in it-- Because we've just covered this in our Handbooker Helper episode. Uh-huh. I told him, "When you're ready, this is where we are." I have a lot of ideas. How do you feel about floating dicks? All right. Of course. Wow. I mean, it feels like a bucket list item checked off the list, but, there were several times that I might have questioned everything that we were doing. I mean, we just had the full pirate experience that a travel agency could not provide. It was very authentic, and that was amazing. Huh? Down To Fire! Still having those dreams, then. In a good way or a bad way? Or is it dependent on the operator? But you think that one of the other's spheres is at the bottom of the shipwreck. Not necessarily a temple. But you-- Fjord and he traded it for power. Well, at least she would be twice as powerful as Fjord is one. I mean there's also-- Which is inside of you. Uh-huh. Yeah. Do we (whispering) need more information? (whispering) To find your ship? Sotto I was debating heavily in watching Avantika to see if, with a distraction of trying to board the pirate ship today, that I can maybe sneak into her office with the distraction. But I noticed she was very adamant holding back and watching the entire scenery. It was not safe to go into her quarters. If we need to get into her office, I think it's going to have to be an important enough and big enough distraction. (whispers) You're doing great! I think if we don't do anything, it means your eventual demise. Unless we beat Avantika to the punch. Oh is that it? Is that our meeting? Okay, yeah. Yeah, because I volunteer. You want me to help seduce Avantika. All right. Oh! It's early. It's four o'clock! Okay. I'm going to make some barrels? What? What does that mean? Is there like an Advent calendar? Less than a year? Yes, queen, yes. Fucking triangulation shit. Because we were over here, right? In the reefs? Uk'otoa? I mean, if it's a triangulation-- Well, this is where we're going, technically this is the shipwreck. Right? This was where we were. There's another reef here. Then there's Torrid Reef here. Do you know in which direction the ship was heading? Maybe he knew where to go, and he was heading there to get his gift. Said Beau in a morning breakfast conversation or something. Oh my god. If someone's allergic, they're fucked, yeah. All of us? We've seen this before. Okay. 20, not natural. 11. That sounds super inviting. Dope. Wow. Okay. Oh no! (whispering) Uk'otoa. The Bloated Cup. Oh my god, Marius! Yeah. Marius the Mariner. LePual. Le-- LePain. LePual LePuain. I don't know. That's all I got. Oh. Caduceus the... Juices? How do you mean? Okay. Yay. Yeah. I guess we'll follow? Mm, do we live with plans? We had a vague idea. Don't we need to pay them more? Whoops. So by touching down on the island, you become a member. We're a part of The Revelry. I don't know if that was the easiest membership I've ever obtained, or the most difficult membership I've ever obtained. It's kind of hard to say. That's for him to do. TRAVIS. No. For me to do? It's for the quartermaster. He said divvy up treasure. European, British giant shit. Hear hear. I'm Beau. Some call me Tracy. Disdain for organized crime in the Empire. Oh yeah. Do you have a favorite cocktail at the Bloated Cup? A brew, or-- Right, course you do. All right, bye. Roof snipers. How much? I yank away from him. Move on. Am I that transparent? How much on average do you pay him to not kill you? And if you didn't share your spoils? Right. There's a war on another continent, and we're not a part of it.
