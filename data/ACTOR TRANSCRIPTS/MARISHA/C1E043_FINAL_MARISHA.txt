Getting on a plane! Never unpacked it. Mainly Liam. Mainly Liam. Right now, on geekandsundry.com. I do like your shirt. I dropped out. Do you want to say? No thank you, keep going. So we slept and we woke up? Yes. Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. We can also talk to the Slayer's Take as well. I didn't meet Zahra. Hi. What are you doing here? Just, you know, rolling through. Passing by. Not much. Vex, Vex, Vex! Vex, Vex, Vex, Vex, Vex! I push Vex out of the way. Yes. Lackeys? And you must be Zahra! That's right, yeah, yeah. (stutters) What if the cost is the end of the world? Sure. That's what we're looking at here. And under rule by an ancient red dragon. They call themselves the Chroma Conclave. No, you're-- you don't double them by city. It's just one city-- No, never mind. Just one dragon. It should speak pretty loudly that we came to you first. That's how much we trust you. It seems familiar, actually. Yup! Osysa. If you are aware of this knowledge, then you know that Vasselheim is one of the only remaining cities still left standing. Are there any other services you can offer to help us fight this? And where does your partner reside? Does he have a name? We just had a third-party perspective. He is south of the Frostweald, in the mountains. I feel like we'll know if it's an ancient Vestige of Divergence. Zahra, Kash? Have either of you been near Pyrah, in the mountains east of here? Have any of you been where the Fire Ashari reside? Do we know how far away the Frostweald is from here? Like where we started, right? In Stillben. That's not far from the Air Ashari, correct? Aw, she likes us. Yeah, I have a couple. That's right, we get union discounts. (nervous laughter) What? As she places it down, can I do a little Gust cantrip and do a little poof of air? Fuck. I know. Oh, that's good though, that's good. I'm good, I'm good. Hang on, let me make sure, make a sleight of hand--18. We're stacking the deck, man. We're stacking it. If they all succeed, it's going to be dope. That's hot. That's hot. No, we wouldn't be handing that shit over. Faberge eggs. I Druidcraft a little tulip and give it to her. Him. Debateable. That's pretty good. I didn't realize there was ten in there. Does this mean we're a terrible influence? Oh, look at that, look at that, look at that! We do have a mapmaker. Wasn't he here? Or was he in Emon? Tyriok, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's right. We caught him in the tavern, correct? Of Vasselheim? Or of--? So there was a few regulars, yeah? Yeah, no. No, healing potions are generally a rip off. I know. It's true, I did buy a book to learn alchemy, and I just haven't had time to do it. The alchemy book? Yes? I'll go with Scanlan and Grog. Okay. Are you coming to the pub? Old stomping grounds, Grog. Yes, he has character progression! (laughter) How'd it go? No, never! What? Hi. What? Three? Two, three? It's blurry. You should join us! You all have to catch up. Come on! Life has been hard! Come on. Is Zahra the only one that claps? I have missed you guys. I've never met you! But I missed you guys. Look, there's never not a good time to toast. Exactly. I toast to celebrating the end of the world with the best friends we could possibly have. All right, Percy, come on. There is something to fight for, damn it! SAM, TALIESIN, and Cheers to that, because God knows we're not the finest. Well, (laughs) I lost a fourth of my civilization! Oh, that's right, we still have work to do. Maybe if we hang here long enough Kima will show up. Plus, when I was a little girl, we used to be taught that if you were ever lost in the forest, to stay and hug a tree. And someone will come and find you. So if we stay in one place and this ale is like our tree, okay? We hug the ale and Kima will show up. That's my theory. Damn it, I was hoping it was Kima! Why are they acting like they fucked? They're ex-lovers! Ooh, Grog! I didn't know you swung that way. Toward-- never mind. (yelling) Another drink! What? Mm, it's been a long few weeks. What? What. What. What? I literally never even had this experience in high school, it's throwing me. I don't know how to react to any of this. Oh! Right! Oh! Funny you mention that, yeah, you know-- I, um, you know, okay, I'm kind of new to all of this. I don't really know what's going on? Thank you. I'm new to that as well. Um-- Okay. Yes. (breathless) Oh. Oh, you think I'm dragging Kash along? Oh no no no no no. I mean, he was just, I only spent a day with him. It was just a day. I thought he was a lockpick. This is literally the only thing Vax is good at. He really can't get out of the closet? Seriously though (quietly) I'm really confused. Kash? Okay. Five o'clock? Oh shit, we need to get the rogue out of the closet. But I miss Kima. (panting) Guys, this is hard to do with alcohol in your system. I didn't know this was a farming industry. Uh-huh, right, those guys. Can I do a nature check? 17. Cool. Yes, can you elaborate? Sorry. Dragon Queen Baator? Is that what he said? Baator? Ten. But, sir, you should understand how close this destruction came from your doorstep. But how do you know that will happen the next time? Is that always where you're going to place your bet? How about four? Yeah, Kima! We want that one. I think her foolish impulses are exactly what Vox Machina's looking for. You said these tomes might still be in Vasselheim? Where? And are all artifacts necessary to defeating these dragons? Osysa. Sir, I come from the Ashari people. We are here to protect those boundaries that we set several thousand years ago. Do you think that some of this knowledge might still be within my people? That's what he calls himself. Or do you think it's possible he is offering any one of those rewards? So, if this is the Third Age, does that mean the Fourth is upon us? As do I. We got it. It's fine. It's handled. Good question, actually. Yeah. And have you met Kash? Kashaw. I just pass Vax my water canteen on the sly. Kima, it's been very hard since we last saw you. Where are we going? I also really need to check out the Fire Ashari. We need to go by there regardless. We need to stop by Westruun. That's on the way. Also on the way out the door. It's not far from here. There are trees. I can also pop through a tree. I can pop through a tree through most places. Pop through a tree and get us to Westruun, as long as we take a nap. Earthbreaker. Percy really wants an airship. Dear gods, does he want an airship. Quickly? Efficiently? I can. Luckily, all places that we are going, we've been to. On our way there, I pace next to Kash. So, do you-- have you met Kima? I get the feeling that you guys knew each other. You seem really put off by it. I didn't know it was so-- Yeah, I feel that. You don't need to apologize. I also don't ever want to hurt anyone. Physically or emotionally. Okay. My liege. It's like Sesame Street. (whispers) Shit, you might have to fight this motherfucker. We're all hanging back. Just watching. Oh snap! He's gonna kick your guys's asses. I know, I'm so confused. That's cool. That's some Bruce Lee shit. (laughs) That's true, that is all you heard. What the fuck is this guy's base? What? Oh, shit. This guy's a badass. Monks, man. That's the worst. Get the blood back in your head. But that's what you said. That's not what you said! What happened, like a chestburster, like came out of him? That's why we have Grog around. It doesn't matter, they all suck. (screaming) Oh god! Yeah, pretty sure. Keyleth runs over to Vax and just hugs him super fast and gives him a peck on the mouth. And says, that was incredible. That was incredible. Are you okay? Do you need healing? I give him another hug and give him a Cure Wounds, level three. I heal you for 12 points. I heal you 12, and then that's actually not bad. Dexterity save? 20 total. I hold his hair back a little bit. His long black hair. I just look at them and I'm like, he got hit in the gut a few times. We're like a mile high, the oxygen's thin here, it's tough. All right, we should go. I saw someone on twitter say that this was like our Cheers episode, and I agree. (laughter) And if you can't make it to Portland, our panel will be on on Saturday on Wizard World's twitch.
