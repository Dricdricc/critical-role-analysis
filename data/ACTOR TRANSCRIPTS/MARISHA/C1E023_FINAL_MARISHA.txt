Yeah, that was a surrealist experience. Yes. And we went today! This was such a great experience, and we took video of it, so hopefully we'll have that edited and maybe sometime next week or the week after, you guys can see and learn a little bit about this charity that we support and talk about every week. Where's Orion? Always makes me actually want to barf. It makes my eyes water and be like, ugh. Yes, oh-- Sam! Yeah, I'm one of the Diamond Dog soldiers that you can eventually recruit and play as, and so you can either shoot at me a lot and kill me a lot, or you can run around as me. And apparently once you get me I've got better stats than Big Boss, which is pretty fucking dope. You should play some Metal Gear. Guys, why don't we just LAN party and only play as characters we voice? Yes! Of narcissism! Rugby's dope, man. They're hardcore. Yeah, we were switched. That's right. It's weird. It does feel weird. Is it colder over there? Are you guys in winter? I know, it's awesome. It depends. Are you serious? All you had to have rolled was a nine or anything other than a zero. That's all you had to-- anything. Scanlan! We took a field trip with her. Sounds like exactly what you needed. We got to meet my family! Yeah! Why do I have to explain it? And we fought a devil. Aw, he's got puppy breath. Oh, yes you do. Yes you do. You want me to cure him of poison? I mean, the Heroes' Feast would have worked. Oh! Wait, go out on the street? You're not going to chase down what's-his-butt? Okay, we're going to find Kern. Hang on, are we going to go find Kern and do this with rules, or we going to do this without rules? Can I do a check to see if I can tell what Lockheed has? What kind of disease? 21. Can I make a few Goodberries for him and feed him a few more Goodberries? Well, I guess that's a matter of opinion, Percy. So much has happened. Oh, Tiberius. You have to be careful. You have to be responsible-- We really need to make that leash for him, like we said we were going to. Follow the trail of distressed people! I hear Scanlan say that and I run out and I say, (shouting) fight! I join in with everybody else. Yeah, did you see that, Kern's fighting Philip! Kern's fighting-- Shit. You should start charging admission at the door. So wait, this betting thing is enjoyable? It feels bad? So why do we do it? I'll bet five gold on Philip. Thank you! Is that how it works? Oh shit! Music change! There's papers just littering our apartment, just information. Our house is a D&D cave. The DDT! Maybe we can start a chant for inspiration. As that's happening, we all start a chant. The balls doesn't give advantage? Come on, Grog! You're right. This is so much more exciting when you bet. He's Mike Tyson-ing you. We can fix it! So, is that-- I was just saying, if we get another chant going-- Cover me. I cast Healing Word on Grog. Okay. Do I get advantage because we're all chanting together? To help me out? Will it be a team effort? No? All right. Oh, that's good, that's a 16. 18 total. Yes, I'm foreign. Deception? 11 total, because charisma. Why do I always get busted? I worship the ever-loving unicorn, Rainbow Fluffers. He rolled a 12 and a 13. Right, guys, have fun! Root for Grog for us! He just come-at-me-bro'd you! Take him down! I've made 20 gold. I'm arrested. Oh, bullshit, you tried to talk me out of it. And I'm also... not from here. Zephra. But they don't know what that means. Yes! I'm owed 20 gold! Oh, I'm so happy you won, Grog. So happy. I wish I could've seen, because I was eating my binder out of stress. Hey, Grog! They're talking about you. We're together now. We're not arrested anymore. You don't have to keep doing this. All right! To Grog the Victorious! You guys, this really makes gambling so much fun. I bought a nice meal for you the other night. That was fantastic. Is there anything else we want to do while we're here? Are we over this town? Over this city? Really? I wasn't there, either! I love this tavern. What time is it? Y'all, we're day drunk! We're celebrating Grog, right? The red and gold robes. Dawn Marshal? So this guy's like the Pope of Kord? I'm foreign! I like my antlers. What's wrong with my antlers? We're in a pub! We're day drunk! Oh, is Tiberius puking? Oh... Wait, where're we going? No! That's right! I have already been arrested today, but I did get better. I wish I were Percy. I mean, we can stay and keep getting day-drunk. Hey, that hurts, Scanlan. We're not there. No. It is literally a pig's head. Wait, are we all doing that together? I'll go with you. You guys, we got a little day-drunk. Let's go together. Come on. Down by the beach, so that we have-- He's just making the sigil. And I just jump in, woohoo! I like jumping into things. I like leap of faiths. They're exciting. Guys, it feels good to be home. How long have we been gone? I thought we had a lawyer for this. I thought we had Burt Reynolds, esquire. We are officially drunk in two different cities! Well... (whining) We haven't been home in so long. I need to water the garden. It's probably half dead. For? Wait. What was his name? Linen Fyken? Leonard Fyke. Just to knock him out? That happened so fast. You know, you might have just sent him to his death. You just put expectations in his head! No, that's not what I'm saying at all. That was his trial. Do you think he would have been happy with work? I'm not even happy that he told him to go off and continue training. I think telling him to go off and continue training is a bad idea. What was that? Who gave you that? What was that? Yes, ask us first. You brought him biscuits? Oh, she fed the stray. That's adorable. It's just not home without her. Our own little inspirational poster, inside each and every one of us. Pike? Tell him if he's okay with us being a little tipsy. Well, I figured we just kept going. (groans) Is it bad news? We're not in the mood for bad news. Wait, when did you say this dinner was taking place? I know! Percy just ran off to the basement, to his workshop. Guys, I feel like we need to have a conversation with Percy. Maybe we could send an errand-boy to get it?
