Oh no! He looks fine. It's all in his head. Oh, natural 20! 24. I turn to Jester and Molly. Fucking-- we probably shouldn't kill crownsguard, even if it's a zombie. Should we go after the toad? I don't want to be a guard killer. All right, fine. Can I peek out and see the guard-zombies? Can I crawl out from under the tent and clear the gap with them and get up to them? Oh, man, I don't know what to do. After Jester trying to help me, can I close the gap to this guy? It's cool, man. Is that fire still going? Okay. With my initial attack as I run up, can I take my staff and try and take them out at the knees? Just a sweep? Yeah, that's what I'm going for. That's not great. Nine. Shit! I look at him and I say, you fucking broke my stick! I'm going to do an elbow to the face and then another punch with the staff still in my hand and do Flurry of Blows. Right, I know. I'm doing an elbow and a punch, I'm just holding my staff. Two attacks, right? Oh god, this makes me so nervous. That's good! 19 for the first one. Oh, and a natural one for the second. Eight? What's in the tent? Thanks. Doesn't make me trust you any more. Less, actually. Ooh shit, that's awesome! Give him the multiplier! Okay, back to the top. I'm going to do with my two-handed, I'm going to use my quarterstaff two-handed and come down and try and crack it over his head. Okay, can I step over the dead guy. Sorry, excuse me. Goddamn it, fuck, balls and shit. 13. Yeah! Fuck yeah! You're so weirded out about it. 11 points of damage. I can hit again with my bonus, right? I'm still trying to figure this out. Right. Learning these combat abilities, it's weird. Okay. I'm going to be like Ugh, die! I'm going to do a big roundhouse kick to his head. That's good, that's a 16! That's an unarmed strike? Okay, eight points! It's a two, plus-- No, wait! I'm sorry, six points. I was looking at the wrong thing. I go, "Ugh, Molly!" "Do it!" Beau goes Who undid my work? Oh shit! Christ! You have a six pack of donuts, but you don't have a healer's kit in there? And you're the cleric? I'm confused. Well, congratulations, you're the cleric now. I'll give it to her. Here, it's a gift. Congratulations-on-you-being-in-a-new group gift. I immediately drop down and start searching the guard. We should hide the evidence. I don't know. Was there nothing useful on the guard? How well did the fire burn the other body? Did it do pretty well or-- I thought he was with you. Oh my god, you are so speaking my language. I grab the other body and start dragging it or at least its torso. Wait, you were shooting shit out of your hands? Oh. I start hooking up the horses. Yeah, one is going to hook up to the wagon and I'll-- which wagon do we want to take? Yeah. Okay. We better get $100,000 from Ford for that one. We better fucking get that. Molly, I appreciate you trying to rally the horses right now, but I really think you should rest. I take the reins. Ornna, is there anything else that you can think of that could possibly help us? Like why this toad decided to freak out right now? Anything that comes to mind before we go chase after your mess. Oh, god! Maybe we can at least find him, stake him out, and then we'll rest. Cats love toads. We ran into those guards that were patrolling the lake-- Hang on, hang on. I want to look around. Do I see any guards? Big dice, don't fail! Natural 20! Like an island? It's far away on the horizon, the little bump? There's two figures on a boat about a hundred yards out. I don't know. It's hard to say. Do they seem distracted? Can I make anything else out? Maybe we can dump them, backtrack with the cart, and drop the cart back off. I'm going to help Jester try and clear the tracks while she positions bodies. (disgusted noise) Eight. If we try and cover the wagon tracks as much as we can, then follow the embankment and try and ride the horses and the cart along the water, it'll hide our tracks as we move northward. Okay. You understand. Towards us? I think they're fishermen. Let's keep moving. North. Do these silhouettes look proportionate to each other? Which way did the fisherman go? I think we should keep heading away from the city, right? Go ahead. Even if we find this thing, if we rest camping out then we're not at the tavern. I bet that's exactly where it is. That's what I was going to say. Let's go back and raid the fire. Should we walk the cart off? See where it goes. I like that. We go along the lake, then off to the edge, and then we're going to give the horse a slap and send him off past-- Using the lake to hide tracks. Whack with the stick. It's not great. Thanks, Travis. Thanks. Six. Correctly hit a horse! 17. 17. Jester! I think so. Yeah, hold on, she's naked! Do you want to get it? Or should I get it? Maybe I should get it. Why didn't you just come and get us when you were ready for us? Does that take you three hours? Love it! It's my favorite. I was waiting for it. The best day ever! She's not your sister anymore. Should we talk about what we're going to say to them? Do we need to corroborate our stories? That's true. Yeah. We know where a good fisherman's boat is. What, how? Wow, that's pretty cool. What's it say? Caleb, we're bored! Tell us a story! Have you heard that joke a lot? So wait, do you seamen have cloisters in Trostenwald? They did look like husks. Okay, so what was Mr. Frogman's diet? How are we absolved yet we still have to be locked in this inn? You should pick better words next time that are slightly more clear. Oh, you found him! Is his name still Frumpkin, it's just a bird now? Yeah, can we hunker down here while-- While she's doing that, I'm going to take my staff and repair where it cracked. Is it slowly eating through the wood? Oh no. Is that what you did with the coin? Is this the coin trick? What time of day is it? That's what I'm thinking. Wait until the sun starts to go down? Because it's got to be soon at this point. Ooh, yeah! Can you give me one going back this way? Thanks. While we're getting ready, Molly, I don't know if you unintentionally dodged the question last time, or if you didn't hear me, but you never exactly told us how the circus creates and writes their performance acts. Oh, so you did hear me though? Just clarifying. You bring your own narrative? Did Toya and Kylre come together with their act? They came separate. That's what they told you? You guys are super easy to lie to, no offense or anything. They lied to them, which means-- You never noticed Toya acting weird? You were never like, "Oh, this is a strange--" Yeah, but there's a difference between "quirky" weird and "Oh, I think this person's life "force is being siphoned away from them" weird. Then why were you with the carnival? (groaning) Let's go find the damn toad! Ah shit. Oh my god, why. Nope, it's a one. I don't know! You know, if it's binary, one means-- Did you see the stink-eye he gave me? This ankle is affecting my wisdom! It's reaching into my family's history! Yeah, I was going to say, why don't you guys lead the way, and you guys give us a signal if you guys see a guard. That's too much, but do I get to keep the change? Damn it. I'll be right back. I go get two bottles. Exactly. No one goes to Crookedstone. Yeah, you guys aren't actually afraid of some-- (yelling) God fucking shitballs cock! (high-pitched) It's great. It's a good roll. You already do. Beach party. The nighttime is the best time to go frog-digging. Yeah! A nergaliid. Thanks? You didn't find anything? We're lowly humans. How did you deal with this? Can I look and see if I see any big broken branches, or sign of something big moving through the forest? Perception? Not investigation? I'd like to move up to the treeline and see where the mud is, and see if I can see any sign of something big moving through the forest. That's the same damn fucking roll. Piece of shit. Investigation? Seven. Like looking for drowned kids? Make a line. You know, it kind of works. Put Fjord on the outside. There we go. Just don't spread out too far to where we're not in shouting distance. That's all right. 17. Oh. I pass it down the line. The shells have been devoured! As we walk, Fjord and I will keep a lookout for any more crustacean empty shells. Help me. I get advantage? Thank god you're helping me. Just perception? 20 total. Is that a cave? I think your eyes are better than mine. TRAVIS. Yeah. With my darkvision, can I zero-in on what she's looking at? Can we surround the hut? We're building a narrative here that Matt is not giving us. Who's got better eyes? TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and He basically saw it. Does it look like, when we get up close to it, like it's caved in on top? Fjord, give me a boost. Getting up on the roof. You hear a dice fall, "And... six witches come out." Which dice? I haven't rolled this dice yet. Maybe it will be kind. Fjord's right next to me. Yeah she is, don't trust that bitch. 16. [imitating him] Borth your swords! I look down at Fjord and I go let me down! Help me down! I can't really do anything; it's just a whack, right? Okay, 21. Just with my staff, right? Not great. Seven points of damage. Summon Devil? Fucking imps! Also 15. I'm going to vault off of the platform that I'm on, and I'm going to go for Toya. I'm going to take my bo staff. I'm going to try and take her where her throat is and grapple her down to the ground. Like to basically throat crush and get on top of her. Yeah. Okay. 15. Grapple her down. It's a 14. Yeah, I know, you can barely see that one. Athletics you said? 19. 18, sorry! Do I have a bonus? Can I crush in a little bit further and get her to stop singing? Just a little! That's right. Y'all thought Keyleth was a fuck-up. What am I doing, just a straight attack? 11. I'm just going to say I felt bad for you before, but now you should be scared. He gets advantage, right, because she's pinned? Oh sorry, sorry, sorry. Of course it is. 20. Just saves. Go for it, I'm just going to be like Shh, shut up! So go ahead. Jester has some self-deprecation issues? That is going to be 16 to hit. Okay, so I've got the little girl pinned, and I am going to go, shh. I am going to take my arm and-- Yep. I want to jam my whole forearm in her mouth. Okay. Ten! A roll off! I get to roll again! (laughter) Okay! Dance battle! Ah-- this one! Don't fuck me, blue! No, that's good, plus, my athletics, right? 16, thank you. Do I have a bonus action? Can I try something else like that again, or do I just get an attack? Okay, my arm doesn't work. I am going to-- Yeah, I'm going to be like, fuck! I'm going to elbow her right in the temple and try and knock her out. Natural 18. 24. Right, 22, yes, 22. No, 24. I'm confused. Okay. New characters, new characters. New character, who dis? Ah, yeah, okay, eight damage! That's all. That ends my turn right? I'm holding this girl? Oh, I'm holding her? Can I drag her back a bit? Into the woods. I'm going to be quiet. Can I support her head? Amazing. No! I know. Who's down? You're down? It's a bitch, isn't it? Concentration's a bitch. I can go first? Who am I next to? Who's Beau next to? And Fjord is in between... I'm too far away from everything. Can I run-- I want to pick her up-- That's fair. No, I'm sorry. I want to move this way towards Molly. Yeah, and I'll try and get behind-- I've got a 40-foot movement. Okay. Do I have any type of bonus action or anything? Can I yell, Kylre! And I want to hold up the girl and be like, come get her! (laughter) Yeah, I tried. Big money! That's not big money! Once again, there is no way I can break through the grounds and get to this imp, is there? I gave my healer's kit to her, so there's nothing I can do to try and bring the girl back? She does. She's already saved one. Damn, there's not a lot I can do. I guess I'll run up. Just there. Can I pick up a rock and throw a rock and be like Get! Get on! Get! Four. 14. I guess that's a four. So ten. Yah! Yah! Is that your first fail? That's good. I'll-- yeah. I'm not a rogue. So seeing everyone dodge this thing, I'm just like-- So I'm just going to run up and be like, stupid! I'm going to try and stomp it. With advantage, right? That hits. 15, natural. With my two-handed staff? Wait. I've already hit. Forget that. Forget that! Eight, so 12 damage. It's like 2am and the lights come on at the club. I immediately run to Toya. Do you-- I've got her. I could hold her, though. Why-- What are you going to do with the girl? Where's home for a traveling circus? I don't know if she feels that way. But I want to, like, keep going. Oh my god! Does this mean we level up? So do you see fit?
