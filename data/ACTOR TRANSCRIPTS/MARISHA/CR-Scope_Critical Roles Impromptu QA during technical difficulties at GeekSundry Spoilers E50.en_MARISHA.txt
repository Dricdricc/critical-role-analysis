Hi guys! Oh I am fantastic, thank you so much for actually asking a question. It looks like they're having a video capture card issue, so we're doing this so you guys don't watch the whole show in fullscreen. Because we're sure you'd be very upset about that. Oh, Minxie. All day, every day. But Minxie has personal value and attachment. And Travis named her. Sentimental value. Yeah. 100%. Once again, I'm phenomenal. I'm so thrilled that you care enough to ask me twice, chat. Thank you. Good. My dad is in town. This is my dad everybody. He just flew in from Kentucky two hours ago. Yeah! (laughs) It's like there's science behind it. What's my favorite spell? I mean, Call Lightning has special love as well because it's Call Lighting. Yeah. Do that. Such a big giant-- Is this one written by Max? That you have more what? Oh. Can we talk about this for a second though? Because once again-- Okay, hang on. MARISHA and I'm going to find out about this. Crit Role Stats put up a chart ranking our nat 20s and our nat fails. You do roll a lot of natural 20s. You are a fucking liar. It's true. Just like you live in Hollywood. (laughing) That's true, a lot of the producers are-- You know what? I'm going to move on. So. Well hang on-- Because me and Taliesin and-- but Ashley doesn't really count, because she's kind of an anomaly. She's been out-- --the math. The sample is too small. Sam and I were tied on natural 20s and only two away from natural ones, which makes me think it's not-- We just-- how we roll Right. Most of the time we don't even roll to attack. Matt is rolling against us. Right. I mean. There's all the skill checks but like you were saying, roll three, and you do too Wondering how much percentage I am I wonder how much more less we roll than you CritRoleStats will murder us if we ask them to count many times we roll.
