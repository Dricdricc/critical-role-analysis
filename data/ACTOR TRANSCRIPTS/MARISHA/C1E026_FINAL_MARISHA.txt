We'll have prints! In my head you're like those Mr. Wooly magnetic toys when you're a kid. I liked her bow. It was cute. I'm really worried about him. Out of curiosity, did anyone else hear him-- did anyone else just happen to hear what he said in that fight last night? It was after that, actually. Never mind. It's hard to say. You know Percy. I don't know where he gets these lines. Jeez. Okay. This is getting really off subject. It was when he was screaming the cluster of things as he was shooting that mercenary in the face, and he said, "What are you doing? You have no reason to be here. Your soul is now forfeit." Really, that last part is the most important one. The first stuff is fairly average. But yeah, "Your "soul is now forfeit." I thought it was maybe a line and then it seemed really aggressive and strong and specific, so it made me think a lot. I don't know. We haven't seen him since that happened. I think he's not telling us everything, that's for sure. Yeah. But screaming, "Your soul is now forfeit?" That's not a secret. That's saying you peed the bed when you were a kid. Oh, really? Sure. But he wasn't screaming this at the Briarwoods. He was screaming this at a random mercenary. What does that mean? To what? Yeah, that's actually another thing I wanted to talk about. That was also really intense. You know, I get it. It was a hard day. It was a hard day, and we tend to get a little aggressive sometimes after hard days. We've all been there. But he didn't just murder an old woman. He chainsawed her. A sleeping, unconscious woman. You also were the only other one who seemed to be confused as to what was going on. That's what I'm saying. That was good. That was nice. That might exactly be what I'm saying. Man, you see this is why I like you, Scanlan. You're so much better at the words than me. I don't think I even knew that's what I felt until you said it just now. I just don't want us to-- She was a really old woman. Sure. But she was unconscious. Yeah, she didn't really do anything at all. I'm not saying she wasn't a threat and I'm not saying we shouldn't handle threats. I'm saying maybe we shouldn't dissect a woman with a spinning Krull blade who's sleeping on the ground. Defenseless, running away. She was fleeing. How do you plan to use your items? For better good in the world? You know, she didn't even really do anything. She was really old. What? You know, I'm really sensitive about that, Vax. I'm really sensitive about that, Vax! And that was different. That was pretty fucking deliberate, what he did. He was being puppeted by sorcerer Michael Jackson. I turn into Minxie and start walking. I come out of Minxie. Can I recognize the spell he's casting? He's doing a cleric thing, yeah? Seven. Son of a bitch. Always a problem. 11. Can I do a quick insight check on Asum to see if I can still recognize if he's still affected by the mind-control thing? Ooh yeah! 28. In fact, I actually might be able to help Seeker Asum, if you will allow me to. Uriel, please-- Just let me do a quick restoration spell on Asum. If nothing is wrong with him, nothing will happen. It's harmless. It's like taking medicine when you're not sick. It can't hurt. And if I am wrong, then we can continue on. We can have Vax tested. Please, it'll take ten minutes. What can it hurt? He came to us. First, I meditate for a second, and I cast Enhance Ability on myself. Can I get some meditation music, Scanlan? Am I maybe inspired by that? Self. To enhance wisdom? Wisdom. Okay. Oh! 29. No, it worked. Yeah, essentially. Yeah. He gave me like a-- I don't know who to trust anymore, to be totally honest. It worked. I could feel it break. It worked, and he's got some sort of long game. I don't know if it's because he doesn't want Uriel to know, for whatever reason. I don't know if it's because he has some deeper, ulterior motive. No. Wait. No to Vex. What was your question? I made sure. I cauterized his wounds, remember? Well, we can split up. I can go with you. Wait, she's coming out of the palace? We were just talking about you! Just accept it for what it is, guys. Is there still the remaining wreckage of their carriage? Is that still there? I have one right now. Oh, I love farmers! Mr. Simms? Northwest? Can I do a nature check to see if I can recognize the creature he's describing? 26. But it is a bird? Yes, keep your money. And can you please tell us how to get to your place. Do you normally stay there? Are you normally home? We'll probably be by like tonight or tomorrow morning. So we're in the middle of doing something. We'll get to it. It's funny how that type of thing can come back to bite you in the ass. Scanlan! Ignore him! And what is wrong with you all today?! I follow. I go to the edge of the door and knock. Percy? It's Keyleth. Okay. We'll be here. Hi! Did you sleep? Do you need anything? We went and saw Uriel. Everyone in the city hates us. They think we're all criminals. Okay, yeah. Oh, we'll see you later, then. I go ahead and I administer Cure Wounds. Can I do an insight check to see if he is also under a mind-control spell? Really? Do we not feel like terrible people enough already? He's the son of a messenger! That's even more ironic! No, I'm good. Continue. Son of a messenger. Only Lady Briarwood? This could be an option to save Whitestone, and you would have your freedom. Would you like to stay in the guest room upstairs? You'd be more comfortable. You could get a good night's rest. You're also the key to our own freedom, so it's important. No, but it can make them allies if they have mutual enemies. Of their enemies. It's a little complicated. Grog, why don't you carry the bed down from upstairs? Would you like something to eat? We'll have our staff bring down some food. Let me reference my spell tome. It's not a common one. It's situational. But let me check real quick. I haven't read that chapter from my book in a while. What? I was reading. What? How? What did you do? Why are you touching me? Don't touch me right now! What? If you touch me one more time! I am doing something else, a request that was already made previously, before "can we fix "drunk Tiberius," so I'm a little busy! Why don't you go sleep it off, take a nap, and I will deal with you in a second. For you. Oh my god. And I shove him into the cell and put him in bed-- Oh, I thought that you said-- everyone was like, Keyleth! No! I thought we were downstairs. You don't fall off the roof. I don't know what I do with him. I let him pass out. I let him go get a sandwich. I don't know! I got distracted! Okay. Wait. My idea. Okay. We were wanting extra fortification? We were wanting extra protection. Okay? I can't necessarily cast a big spell. I could cast Hallucinatory Terrain. We have a few options; I'm giving them to you all. I can cast Hallucinatory Terrain to make this look like something else. I don't think-- I don't know. I don't know if that's a good idea. I don't know. I could conjure a few woodland beings for, like, extra bears. We could have some bears guarding the palace. I could also throw up a Wall of Thorns, to barrier the cell with the wall of thorns. You're not here? I went downstairs, and I'm saying this to the group so I don't have to repeat myself! The thing with Wall of Thorns is it's not super big. It's 60 feet. No, it's 100 feet high. It's really high. Actually, I don't know how high it is. Don't quote me on that. But it's not that long, but we could fortify the doors more. Have bears. We could do multiple things, too. On the Briarwoods? Percy's behind. Huh? All right, I'll make some extra bears. What gets rid of drunkenness? (laughs) I don't want to burn a Restoration spell on your drunkenness. What time is it? I make an army of bears. Wait! No! Hang on. What if I conjure a bear, and then-- let me make sure, while they figure their stuff out. See, we're all figuring stuff out? Okay! I have a better idea! Why don't I conjure an elemental, and then I can cast Planar Binding on him and he'll hang out for 24 hours. I was figuring it out. It's new. Figuring it out. Yes. Water elemental. I know! Why do you do that? I know! And an awesome diamond has got to be more than 1,000, so this time there's got to be at least 1,000. Grog, what kind of jewel do you have? A palm-sized ruby? Tiberius. That's true. To be fair, the castle's being heavily watched by outsiders, as well. I could also talk to cows again. Maybe these cows will know something. First can I ask her, you said your neighbor boy, Kyle? Where does he live? Thank you. I go to Kyle. Yes. No! Wait! Don't leave yet. We need you. That's irrelevant. The point is, I was wondering if you had any more information about the creature. Do you remember any other details? Any other defining details other than "bird?" Your kid is weird! I'm into this plan. But doesn't that essentially make us the bait? Well, here's the thing, maybe a few of us should not be cows because only a few people are going to have the ability to turn out of being a cow once they are a cow, unless they take damage. It's okay. What Vax said was way worse, earlier. Another thing is, I can turn into a cow. I can turn someone else into a cow. Well, Polymorph is a concentration spell. Oh. Because you got that thing. Oh, I'm a cow. Except for me who is going to be an actual cow. We're all cows! Just embrace it. Scanlan would be like a calf. Big calf. If we use Seeming, we just appear to be cows, but we can still speak, right? Would be like, holy shit, those are talking cows! We are going to look like cows. Are we going to look like cows to each other, too? Okay. Okay, shall we go interview some cows? Which one looks like the alpha male? Tiberius, just because you look like a cow doesn't mean you can talk to the cows. The cows don't understand English. No matter if you look like a cow, they still don't understand Common. I cast Speak With Animals. Yes. Actually, how many animals can I hit with Speak with Animals? It is called Animals, right? Or is it just Speak with Animal? Oh, just me the ability? Oh, yeah. I think you're right. Okay, so I cast Speak With Animals on myself. Okay, so I go up. Is there a cluster of nice-looking ladies, sitting around? Hello, ladies. Good evening. I do apologize to awaken you. I was just curious if you could tell me a little bit about some of the events that have been transpiring around here lately? Mainly, the results of your kind getting killed? Have you seen a giant bird flying around? Anyone? Oh, sure. Right. Where, exactly? Where have they been-- okay. Damn, cows! It's never-- I'll get back to you in one second. Can you tell me anything about what it looks like? Does it seem to come at a certain time of the night? They're cows. I forgot that talking to cows never goes well. Didn't seem to know a lot. They're simple-minded beasts. Yeah, poor Dork. Dork the ox. I make myself look available. I step away from the rest of the herd a little bit. 100-foot wing span? That hits. No, I'm normal. 16. Judging by the fairly close up appearance I have of him at this point, can I tell it is probably a "beast" nature? Okay. I'm going to attempt to cast Dominate Beast. It has to make a wisdom saving throw. That's my turn, right? Can I try and break the grapple as a bonus action? Scanlan? What the shit? Yay! Vox "Moo-china!" (booing) Do I have a turn yet? Yeah? I cast Polymorph on it. You're on it. Really? Out of thematic reasons, I also turn him into a cow. (laughter) My spell DC? 18. I go eagle form. As a bonus action! I don't think that's how it works. I can catch him, if you need catched. What does he add? His spell attack bonus? Did it not drop the cow to 0 hit points? Yeah, let's go for the element of surprise. Well, technically, we're all still cows. All of us? 21. Yeah, we did. All of us? 12. I don't want to kill a mama. Maybe we can transplant her. Capture her and move her away from town? So there's a sheer peak and they're nested on the side of it? I fly over as an eagle. Can we drop Seeming? I also approach and come out of my eagle form. Next to Tiberius. Can I see Vax? Is it higher than a 31? No. I land beside Tiberius and come out of eagle form. Tiberius, would you please Dispel this cow form from me. Please? Thank you. Are you a druid? I'm also a druid. I think our goals might be aligned. It's okay. What's her name? I can relate to that. Because we were seeking justice for other people. Let's not let this escalate. Okay? What is your name? Vyron? Byron. I reach up to it and reach out to pet its beak. Okay. 19. I kneel down a bit. Produce a few Goodberries. Reach out. It's okay. It's all right. That's a good girl. I turn back to Byron-- Yeah, and go, that hurt. Now. Please listen to me. Please, please listen to me. We did come here to kill the giant creature. But upon seeing the situation, upon approach, realized the situation and decided amongst all of us that we did not want to bring such a great creature to its death. 20 total. I'll take that 20 total. Under one condition. Just because one can appreciate nature, does not mean that one cannot also appreciate humanity. Question. If this is a young, adolescent creature, what do you think of the destruction it could cause once it reaches full adulthood? Are you okay with having that on your conscience? This creature could result in the lives of many. If you relocate out of town, just a few miles. Say like 50 or 100 or so because this thing's really damn big. So I'm sure it's got a pretty big-- you know what I mean. I will help you. I will personally come with you and tend to their safety. And make sure that their location is proper and safe, and handled with respect. Then you will be out of the harms of poachers. You can live off the land, and you can be free and alone. Listen-- Yes! That is correct. Listen. We are being nice. Don't think that we will be the first. You will have more people come and hunt you and kill this, as this beast continues. How long do you think you can survive waves of mercenaries coming to try and kill this? We are the nice ones. I suggest you heed our warning, take our help, and save the life of you and your creature in the long run. There is an alternative. Tiberius can tell you of that alternative. I was setting you up for an awesome one-liner, man! You were supposed to be like, the other option is death. Yeah, I don't know about that. Wait! No! Hang on! No! This is getting out of control already. I will not let you all do this! No! Not today. You guys have caused enough problems. We are not going to push this creature on other people. I'm trying, all right? I'm working on it. I don't want to push this problem off on a town that's already being held hostage by vampires. That fucking sucks! That's double shitting on them. That actually is fairly true. Please, please listen to us. We're only trying to help. Please believe me. I let this thing almost take my hand off, and I'm still standing here fairly cogently talking to you, so please take that as a sign of honesty. Listen. She's right. We have friends in Vasselheim. We can contact the Slayer's Take. We're a part of their guild. We can tell them that you're coming. They'll not bother you. We can tell them they are not allowed to take out a contract on your creature. You will not be harmed. Because they don't have mercenaries out there. It has to be approved! So it's really good. I feel like I've done pretty damn good! Come on, man! How many fucking persuasion rolls does this asshole need? Please. We really don't need another death on our conscience today. Before he leaves. Well, wait! We've got to go to the farm. And I tell him, if you're up that way, there's a druidic tribe, a little village called Pyrah. They're Fire Ashari. You can find their headmaster Cerkonos. He's a friend. You might find your people there. Who knows? Maybe friends will do you good. Yeah, it was.
