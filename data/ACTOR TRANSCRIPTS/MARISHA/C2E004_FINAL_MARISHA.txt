Old jokes. Isn't every awards show, though? Tell them you want to run a D&D game for them. You should go check out Good Fortnight Kevin on Alpha because it's a morning show and it's funny. It's dumb and it's super meta. I'd say you have a pretty impressive sword, too. I'll help you out. (groaning) Yeah, this is frightening. Yeah, what are we carrying him by? I grab the jaw and I say "Hey, Jester." (chanting) Level two. It's coming across the border. It's real good. (groaning) Move! I said we were going to be doing some frog digging. Yes? We could also toss him a bit of gold if we think it would make him forget the night. What makes you think he's going to go talk to the authorities? Who cares? I did, but everyone also hated the circus. I pull two out as well. You've got fisherman vibes. Here. (clink) Yeah, we're an underground anonymous activist group. When we get to the shore, we should probably split up. That's a good question. We could leave someone with it, and we can just-- You can go and alert the authorities. And gold. I like getting paid. What was that guy's name? Oh, wait! Jonas and Lucas. The Jonas Brothers. Also, Toya. If she would speak honestly, she would absolve all of us. Sorry. Really, Jester? Sorry for choking you with my stick. And I'll never do it again. As long as you don't try that again, of course, I guess. Yeah, I wasn't trying to hurt you. I was just trying to get you to stop singing. But it was so abrasive. I did. How do we trust you all won't skip town in the middle of the night? So? I have a plus six to my stealth. Sorry. I feel like the cloak is identifying to you. Like where did this really pretty pink and lavender cloak come from? I'm sorry, green. I haven't looked at the art. Ten total. I immediately drop to my knees and start looking for a shoe. Drop one of those rings, drop a ring! Can she tap? No. Just go with it, go with it. Found it! The ring. So stupid! Yeah, we really are. Let's all get caught. Help. Help. Help. (laughter) Oh sorry, I just have back issues. I'm just stretching. Welcome to the club! Welcome to the chain gang. That's smart. (chanting) Shitty dice! Wow. As soon as Beau gets out of her chains, I grab my stuff and I leave. What's the mantle? Is he blocking the doorway? Is there another way out? Okay, I'm just going to try and just bolt through. Not run, just you know, Irish goodbye. Do I recognize him? I just go Oh, fuck! Turn around and walk back in. I'll join everyone else. I flick off the guy on my way back in. Just had to pee. That's a lot of gold. That's like a life sentence worth of gold. Can I go take a look around? Do I see Zeenoth anywhere? Oh, god damn it, it was almost better. It was almost good. Ten. Archivist. Yeah. Different guy. A glitch? What? I still think there's something creepy about this lake, man. It gives me the heebie jeebies. Yeah, she's one of us. Speaking of swords-- Arm wrestle! Arm wrestle! Bets on Yasha. I don't know what we're talking about anymore. Are you guys going to arm wrestle? Okay. How about "Boulder, Paper, Shears"? Wait, what is it? "Boulder, Parchment, Shears"! And apparently, nobody really cared about Enon, so that's, you know, good for your conscience. Man, we caught the last show, you guys! They might! I'm gonna keep this flyer. Have the airships made it to this continent yet? Oh, you know, I'm just doing a walking tour? Through the continent, just kind of-- Yeah, just like a backpack vacation, you know? Just stretch my legs a little bit. Meeting some fine people. Discovering myself. Yes. What's it matter to you? (laughs) That's your problem. So, you guys going to take off or do you guys want company or-- ? I've bend down to Toya, and I take off one of the little jade bangles around my wrist, and I say, "Here. This will keep you safe from assholes named Beau. Except for that asshole, named Bo. He's a good Bo, but all other assholes named Beau." Sorry. Sorry again about that. You better. My first nemesis! I give her a little chin (weak punch sound). Aw, why? No! For her, yeah, I mean I got to give it to her, yeah. Where are you guys heading off to? Seems like people are making pretty big plans. How long ago was it that you guys broke out of prison? Damn, you guys are doing good. There's nothing wrong with being alone. And where was 'there'? Yeah. Cheers to that. Are you claustrophobic? You mentioned the smaller cl--cramped space in the cell. Just curious. Clamps-- clampy space. Not tied down to anything but that cloak, am I right? (chuckles) Yeah, I actually feel like you're starting to get a rash. (laughter) You guys want me to tag along with you? (chuckles, clears throat) No. I'm free on my backpack tour. No plans. Maybe avoid Zadash just because I just came there, you know. Don't want to hit the same place twice. Yup. (groans) Hey, Zeenoth! Hey. It's been all of about twenty minutes since I've seen you last. Okay. It's cool. I've got it. (sighs) Yorda is the bartender. I just look at Zeenoth and go really? Is this really necessary? Do we have to with this guy? He fucking-- look at him. He looks shifty. Sorry, you're super covered-- literally saw no features until right now. You're very attractive though. (laughter) I smell bad y'all. Don't. You were like, oh my cape smells bad and I was like RPing and I like, ooh. (laughter) They gave us an amazing matching set with the Elvis-- Elvish for our wedding. It was super sweet. Thanks Wyrmwood. Elvis from Memphis. See you, guys. This is so scary! So nerve wracking. Mm-hmm. Really? Is this what got me caught, working for these fucking assholes? Ugh. I walk in. What is this? I'd prefer to stand. (laughter) Sorry. (laughter) Keep going. I'm listening. Thanks? No, I didn't agree to shit. You took me in because I'm assuming my father paid you a pretty nice sum of coin to make sure that you took me in. I'm assuming that coin is no longer coming to the Reserve, so, why do you care? Yeah, I thought you guys hated me. Thought I was doing you a favor by leaving. Thank you, authoritative figure who I am unaware of your name? Yeah, I'd say that sorting books and punching brick walls repeatedly can definitely not be stimulating at all times. The fuck was that? I feel like he made me look like an asshole, feel like an asshole. Fuck, maybe I'm an asshole. Being nice never did. What are we talking, stranger? Dairon? Some people like to call you boogie men. I figured it was always real. In my opinion, the best way to hide in a secret organization is by having a boogie man. Wow. Oh god, I'm sorry. I have this burn in my butt from all the smoke you just blew up my ass. It's just, oh god. Is that a magical talent? 17. It takes me to the ground. That takes me to the ground. No, just takes me to the ground. Do I have a choice? Oh, boy. Is that what I have to look forward to? I kind of want to fucking punch you back. Now you have my attention. And I fucking punch her in the face! Just a straight unarmed, right? 12 total, not good. Ow! What the fuck, my dad used to do that type of shit. That misses. 17. I got to add some points here. (yells) I'm going to spend a ki point, and go into Flurry of Blows, and do a blind haymaker, a second blind haymaker, and then try and backhand with the third. Wildly, recklessly. Okay, first one. Natural 20! Second one. Natural 20! I don't have anyone sitting next to me to confirm this, but I swear it's a natural 20! I'll take a picture if I have to! A natural 17. Okay. You double the dice, right? Okay. That was a three, a two, so five, ten plus eight. 18. One, so another five points. God fucking-- Thinking of my dad, after she just went "boop," something just popping the back of my head. Just a wild backhand. Not great. That's a natural seven, so ten total. What the fuck, why can't I feel my hand? What did you do? You don't know shit about me, bitch. I'm going to take another attack. That's a three. That's a nine. Roll. I rolled a 15 to attack. Second attack. These are two attacks, right? 15, so, 21. Okay. Attacking her with the first one, and then I'm just going to duck down a little and jab her right in the ribs. Eight. I back up. I'm going to spend another ki point to do my defensive stance. Patient defense. Instead of getting distracted by her, I just listen to her and look at her out of my periphery. Right as she comes down and I'm going to use-- Oh, wait, dodge? Go first? Miss. It says patient defense, spend one ki point to take the dodge action as a bonus action on my turn. Oh. Cool. You said two more points? 11. No, sorry, 12. Yeah? Okay. I got to hand it to you, that was awesome, and I want to know how to do that. You beat me. Okay. (groan) I grab that stool, and I drag it over. Does she beat the shit out of Zeenoth? Sorry, Zeenoth. Sorry. God, we're such assholes. Yeah. The world does need an asshole. We'll work on that one together. We'll work on that. That's good, that's good. What do I do until then, do I just continue-- Why are you doing this? Why me? I don't really believe in systems or being a part of them, let alone a system that takes down other systems. Seems almost hypocritical. Touche. You might have broke my wrist. Bye, Zeenoth! Zeenoth! Zeenoth! Bye. I leave. Hi, friends. How's it going? Hi, guys. Sorry I snuck in last night. Several times. Horse is fucking dead. I ate it. Horse is fucking fine. Hey, Jester, do you have a bandage? Do you have a thing? Yeah, crack. Oh, you made it worse! I've had some sprains that feel like breaks. Thank you. Man, it was a great night. I had a great night! I haven't had a great night in a long time, you guys. That was a great night. I might have been accepted into, like, a secret society. It's kind of secret society business. It's hard to talk about. Okay! No, I can't. It's fine. There are these monks. I thought they hated me. It turns out they like me. Turns out they want me to become a part of their gang. But it's not really real, and they're like, "Just keep doing your thing! But you're against injustice and seek out truth and break systems!" You know, I said something like that to her. It wasn't as black and white as that. I wouldn't say this woman was my friend. I would say she's definitely a badass. I wouldn't say she's my friend. She was. His name was Zeenoth. He's an archivist of the Cobalt Reserve. Lot of books there. Lot of books. I think so. I'm not a hero. That's not what they did. It's more like a vigilante! Like what we said! Yeah! No. Do you need an insight check to know that that was shady as fuck? That's a good idea. It's like a bad video game glitch. Bad texture glitch. We've already been to the general store. You can still make her draw a map. I don't want to rain on your parade. I'm sorry. I totally did. (singing) General store! (singing) I want to buy another health pack! I meant a healer's kit. Yeah. Yeah. That one. You won twice. I can just pop in if you want to wait outside. You're not wrong, generally, yeah. Can I also get another healer's kit? If you have one. Five gold. Well, one healer's kit. She's got the other one. Put it in the middle. Wait, where are we? Happy birthday, Deven! I got it. This town blows. I don't care. [laughter] Let's go, bye! Thank you! [bell dangling noises] Look at this bruise. Look, it's in the shape of a dick. Is that what skein means? Can I do an insight check on this guy? See if he's trying to scam us. Can I use my criminal background? To know if he's actually giving what he's giving? Just straight insight. It's not as good as I would've hoped. 18. Okay. One for me too. I assume you'd want to go ahead and give it to us for that so that we keep this a secret. Before I go out I say, nice to meet you, mister--? I go Okay, Davies. Do you want anything? Well, it was kind of a ploy to get a cheaper health potion. And we got drugs on top of it. It was a win-win, am I right? That's cute. Do we hear them doing these plans? Do we hear you guys making this plan? "Solstryce?" MATT and Is that the name of the town? Is that where your clan is from? Nah, it's cool. We can go back. Yeah, I mean, there's a few places that I didn't get to see in my sight-seeing roundabout, didn't get to hit everything. Now that I've slept on it, I've had a change of heart. It's a nice town. What do I know about Zadash that I could tell them? Can I tell them anything? That's right. Zadash is on the edge of the empire too, right? Didn't peg you for a flowers type of girl. I mean, it can, though. Oh, she was. That's on the way to the "Solstryce" Academy? A horse and a carriage. I'm assuming it can't fit all of us. Are we all going to get along for a couple of weeks? That's true, that's true. That's also true. Poor Ashley, we make her come up with excuses every time. You know you're not beholden to Gustav anymore, right? Is it Bo? The other Bo? Is it Desmond? Is it Ornna? While we're stopping by the post office, can I talk to the courier person? Yeah, I was just wondering if you had any incoming mail for the Baumbauchs? I said that I would pick it up on the way home, heading over there. That's good! 20. No. Deception? 19 total. Thank you so much. He's going to be so happy to not have to run this errand. Thank you, bye. Oh, sorry, here you go. I give her a gold. Have a good day. Let's go. You said how many? Three parcels? Like the three rules of Fight Club.
