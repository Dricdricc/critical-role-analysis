It's a little Logan! Is that a Winston shirt?! Holy shit! It's a Winston shirt! That's cool. TALIESIN and This is so going on our-- Yeah! The chicken coop! On your chicken coop! That's so cute! Oh, man. This is a good box! Does it turn into a raptor? Is it scratch and sniff? Tell us about Loot Crate, Sam. Sam, when did you get here? It was crazy! It is going to be aired during Talks Machina this week, in place of our normal show, so if you miss it, you get to see the full panel in its entirety. (accent) Talking comics. (accent) Talking comics. We released a ringtone (laughs). As well as-- so you can now get our theme song as your ringtone on iTunes. We also released a free screensaver, that you can download, based off of the old flying toasters. After Dark, yeah, flying toasters. The WinAmp skin was cancelled, but we're working on it. But yeah, we-- just because we thought it was funny. That's how we choose to spend our free time, is releasing free screensavers, yeah, so go do that. (laughs) He brings us in chunks, that was phenomenally worded. (laughs) Very murderous. Very shark-chummy. I'll have a panic attack is what (clears throat) I want to do. All right. Fuck me. Okay. Ugh, don't fuck this up. Don't fuck this up. I am going to continue with my original plan. Can't-- Getting cotton mouth. And, (laughs) And I'm going to slowly start from the top down, transforming-- forming-- Shut up, Sam! No, I want to use Shapechange. Yes. Right? Because I can't Alter Self into an erinyes. Right. So I'm doing it now. An erinyes. It's that thing that we fought in the City of Brass. There was like the devil that we fought-- Yeah, the one that you squared up against with, for most of the time. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. (deeper voice) You know, I never did catch your name. What do they call the two of you? You got Dis! Oh, I'll take that 18. And I think my intimidation's an eight-- No, it's a seven. So-- 25. Yeah. Are you sure? Because I would love to know, maybe add you to the collection. Oh, what's the matter! Where're you going? And then I turn around, and I (strained) just start walking cool-- (whimpers) Yeah, I can fly! That's also, this is a concentration spell. So, I can't do-- Okay, so I'm going to, as I-- Is anyone looking around? Anyone looking around right now? God damn it. 22. I look at it. And I just nod. And then I start heading back towards the tavern. Before I round the corner, I want to just take and do a quick Shapechange again into the tiefling that I was. Into the tavern. Go upstairs to the rest of the group. (panicked gasping) Okay! Okay! I didn't make it far! I didn't make it far. Woo! I made it around the corner, and the two devils that seemed to be very interested in you, Vax, cornered me-- (nervous laugh) Huh? I have a feeling it has something to do with your deity. I think they can tell that Vax is special. I think-- He has value down here. They said they were interested in 'the white one.' And I couldn't help but notice that you were turning quite a few heads when we were walking through town. I don't think it has anything to do with the way you looked. I don't think it matters what he turns into, I think people will be able to tell the aura that he carries with him. Well, I can do this for about another 55 minutes! Before we'd have to sleep before I can do it again! I was going to go see if I could get a bead on where Hotis is. Oh! What, guys, check this out, this is what I freaked 'em out with. And I go back into the erinyes form. (deeper voice) Check it out. Check it out, that's pretty hot, right? It makes my-- -- it makes my voice a little smokey when I'm down here too, right? I know. I'm an erinyes. It's with an 'e'. Erin. Like Erin-yes! Yeah. Yes. Well, changing into this thing meant that I had to drop concentration on my Locate Creature spell. I can only concentrate on one thing at a time. It gets-- Especially this, it's a lot to mentally focus on. I noticed-- Just let it go, Percy. I noticed we're being watched, I think at every turn. There was a little imp guy watching me when I came in. Oh, shit, that's right, your dad! A long time ago. Wait, did you really? Well, get that-- Get that-- can I-- Get that out. Get that out. Yeah. Percy-- Your-- (laughs) (laughter) Did you really? Holy shit! Let me, let me see if I can get something out of it. Can I scry on it? Like scry and see if it shows me something? Is that-- a thing I-- no? Individual. I don't have that. Oh, I know. Okay. You know, this imp that I saw did have sparkly gold armor, he may be like an important imp. I'm just saying, I feel like everyone's here wanting to make a deal. It might be good to talk to others. I feel like we don't need to make a deal to go murder someone to get arrested. I feel like I could just go streaking in the street and just say words, and we would get arrested. Why do we need to commit this crime, and then suffer the apt consequences? Can he get us out? Out never came up?! Then why do we need him as our in? Yes, I did. Yes, I did. I could do-- attempt something similar. Potentially with a higher-level version of my Locate Creature spell-- -- which is Find the Path, which could get us close. Potentially. It's a Lawful Evil dimension. If he wants his boss dead, that means that there's going to be someone else above him. If we kill one guy, who's all going to want to kill us? He's literally still holding it in his hand in front of your face, you just-- Ooh, look at you! Oh my gosh! Wow. Well, we just-- It's like curfew. We have to be home in about 50 minutes. The what? The prison? I didn't see how big. It seemed immense, and like it was probably pretty big underground? But I couldn't-- can't be for sure. It won't get us out of here, no. Oh. You know, we have a day or so. Does anyone else think that we should maybe not take the first deal that presents itself in the first tavern that we step into in the city? Does that not seem super convenient? I mean-- (transforming sound) (deeper voice) We've got about 50 minutes, if we still want to go. What? I think an extra day of walking around this city could potentially save us years in hell that-- We don't take the deal. He said he wants the day. Do you have to make a point in the room we're sleeping in? No, we can show him later. Do you want me to be Poppa-- (stammering gibberish) (laughter) It's been a long week. Do you want me to be the erinyes? All right. Do my thing. No. Sure, I got 30 minutes left of this 9th-level spell. I look like-- I currently look like that. That's true, I can do it all. He's right, I'll just take my regular tiefling form. For now. Correct. For 30 minutes. Aw, fuck, it's long. It's like the CPA mini-game of Vox Machina! It's so fucking long. It's got to be at-- there's like-- I feel like we should give this to Grog. (laughs) It's definitely like an iPhone contract. At what cost? At what cost? My favorite line "This contract as a whole remains until the predetermined period of "eternity." That's my favorite! Wow-- And you just have to, like, say that? You're like, 'Yo, Ipkesh, I take that second pact!' Mm, I mean-- I already got close! The bastion of death is-- The Bastion of Flesh is who he wants us to kill? Correct. I could also do Find the Path if I have a little piece of the prison. If we could get a little piece of the prison-- What? Hey, there are people who walk away with pieces of forests, beaches, all the time. I don't know. Does there look like an oddities store? (laughs) Yeah. He did have a cloak, but-- I mean, last time we saw him, he was also a-- little, writhing-- I don't know if he would still have those items. Does there look like there's a weird oddities store or dealer or-- Natural 20! Hee hee hee-- That's bad. You just got punished for being too witty! It's so sad! Oh no. I feel like we have to call you Yrat now. I'm never going to-- Wode and Wade? What the shit? Wode, and Wade, Yrat-- And you can call me Minxie. Greg. Well, imagine this is happening quickly, right? Thing is-- I'm looking for something specific. Do you have any pieces or remnants or items from the Mentiri Prison? Specifically from the Bastion of Flesh? Why not? Where is it located? We need in. And then I slowly start to Shapechange just for the erinyes face, and I give just a flash of it. We need in. And you're going to help me, aren't you? Fucking hell. Fucking hell. It's a 19! But it was almost bad! Plus seven, so 26. Well then, how do people get around the city? You know. Where do I find them? And I show them the ring of Asmodeus. He has it. (high-pitched singing) It can only be Jared! I need a name and location of where to find the information that I need. Then who does? God damn it-- the chain devils. All right. Yes, I had one of those for breakfast. I snatch it from him. Yrat, do the thing. Well, it's to relay information back to whoever's wearing it? Or to him specifically? We'll take it for good measure. I guess? I just want this as a souvenir for our visit. I'm not going to pay for it. You're not going to sell this; I want it. Right? I lean forward and I take my erinyes nail and I go around his face, and I say, consider this a good-faith investment. You will be seeing us again. And I take out 20 gold. 20 gold. If you minions would like to buy the purple stone with your allowance-- -- the mistress grants you, you may. You're welcome, young Wade. Very. Keep it that way. All right. Roll out. (laughter) It was taking everything to not say "Autobots!" And I kind of want to-- I use Alter Self to go to my tiefling form. As we start-- are we walking back towards the tavern? As we walk, I-- So it seems one of the lesser devils who is interested in Vax might be our ticket in. The chain guys. Yeah, I guess I could. I'm wondering if worst-case scenario we could always use you as bait, Vax? Sorry, Wode. Party on, Wode. We get back. Okay, we gotta get back to the tavern. Back to the tavern? Well, to be fair, I feel like these people are used to being watched. 20. I hate it when that happens! It's like a flashbulb going off in your eye! Ugh, bastards! Oh, Christ! I can't, that's it, that's all I got for the day. That's it. I got 4th-level spells and lower. It's the little things. That was-- very specific. No, but I feel like you have. Don't worry about it. What? Percy-- Such a hero! Is it only because you've experienced these types of temptations before? No, we'd just have to release a couple of devils into the material plane. Yes, I agree. Percy, if you die, though, doesn't this mean that you forfeit your soul here--? You're fine? That was my question. Yes, but we came here willingly-- Yes. Percy, we've come here to try and kill a kitten, and it's already been a massive pain in our ass. We really don't want to come back to try and save your soul. Talk about-- talk about the revisions first! Always get those revisions first. And a new print-up. That we need on a t-shirt! That would be nice. Oh, again? Jesus, fuck-- Ask about the Bastion of Flesh-- Ask about the Bastion of Flesh. Well, how big is this prison-- Not the full name? (laughs) Musel Who? What? Oh shit. Yes! Ooh, tiger maple! It's a dice tower where you make the magnets happen Go take that survey! Easter weekend! I'm going camping. Yeah. Yeah, it's going to be so good. Stealth in, kill a pit fiend. Done it before, we can do it again. Okay, I'm confident about this plan. How did we do it last time? And bumblefucked our way out of it. I can do-- Nope, nope, I can't. Sick. Eat your cheerios, bud. What, the sheets? Doty. I got a 17 and an 18, that's pretty damn good. 32. Don't we still have some rations that we have been carrying around with us for quite some time? I could Animal Shapes us there, yeah. All of us. Eighth level, but it could be worth it to not be seen and get the drop. I imagine we'd get there, do Animal Shapes to get through and get to him. Yeah. Bugness Everdeen. Thank you. Laura liked it. Later. Not now. Let me figure that out. Who's got a Player's Handbook in the house? Animal Shapes. What are you looking at? Large or smaller beast. So I can't do anything-- -- microscopic? Not microscopic but tiny. I can't be tiny? Bird-size. I'm Alter Selfing into my tiefling form. That's good. 38. But lemurs are so cute. Lemurs! 29. No, Percy! Come on, Freddie. That's what happens when you sell out, man. Come on! Don't fuck up, Percy! Don't fuck up! It's all right. I was going to say, Jurassic Park. All of us? 34. Are there fissures? Steam vents? Yeah, how noticeable is the bent bars? Go, Grog. Do we still have Pass Without a Trace on? MATT AND Does she look familiar? Wow, have you guys been rehearsing that? That was impressive. Good job, twins! I know, it's confusing sometimes. Well, this is Freddie, that's Yrat, that's Wade and Wode, and that's Greg. You can call us Mox Vachina. So there's no one else in here, right? Is it still dark? Yeah, I light up my hands. Tova, that sword makes you look so tall. Do we still have Pass Without a Trace? Okay, cool. Yeah! Yes. Yes! That's bad, that's a natural one! I was so excited and then it went away so quickly! Three? Aw! Come on, come on. What? Sort of like an 80s fantasy novel cover. No! Kill it. Come on, Percy. Oh, son of a bitch! What's in it? End this. It's okay, we love you! No. You're an amazing person. Kill him! Kill him! (laughter) That was hot. Metal Gear Solid this shit. Hey! Hey. Really? That's what cool people say. My turn. Guy's dead, right? That Grog was after? It is hell. That's not a devil demony guy behind Grog. You almost touched it, sorry. What's that? That. That. Oh, okay. Okay. And I don't see anything. Tova! Tova! You're really awesome! Are you also a druid? No? It's been a long day. I move and I peek my head through the door. Grog! What's going on?! You're okay? All right. Grog! I don't know what to fucking do right now! Bring him back in! Okay! I can't move any more, though. Okay. You know, there's not a lot I can do right now, so I'm going to say, Grog! Grog! You got this shit! You got it! And I'm going to cast Enhance Ability, and I'm going to give him enhanced strength. Oh wait, what? Can I make him smarter? Or more stealthy? I'm going to give him enhanced dex. You already have advantage on that too? I feel like we're alerting the whole god damned house. A handle, or a candle? Okay. I am going to back myself up in this corner that I'm in, and I'm going to cast Locate Creature. Who's got the book? One action! It's one action, because I knew that. And I'm going to cast, and I'm going to say, Utugash. (whispers) He's in the next room. He's in the next room! Be quiet! Jesus, be quiet! Utugash! I look at Grog. Grog! Utugash. Utugash! Grog! By that wall! I'm trying, he still doesn't understand words! He's on the other side of the wall! Utugash! Because I was trying to be-- I was trying to be stealthy! Shift of stones? What? Do you guys want to flank? I think we can flank. Looks like there's an entrance on either side. He's in this room. Can I take this opportunity to do a quick Inspiring Leader speech? Then no, I'm not going to do that, I'm going to flank around this side a bit. Other side. There might be a door over there, right? Two doors? Is there a door on that side? Yeah, if we can flank him, that'd be great! Yeah, I follow. I follow Tary as well. Are we splitting up? Anyone going through the door? Can maybe Tary gives us one entrance and then we use the actual entrance as well-- -- so we're all not going into one entrance? Flank a motherfucker? This could be door number two over here. That way we're all not crowding through one door. Do you have advantage on that? Because of my thing? Okay. (laughs) Still cool. Are you available next week? We could've found you in a magical shop. We could've found you in a prison. I think I called him U-tu-gash, because that's what I wrote down. Like Uta Hagen, but Utugash. Oh, it is U-T-U, Utugash. Okay. Big room.
