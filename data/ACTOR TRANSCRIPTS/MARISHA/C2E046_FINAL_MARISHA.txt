Have you been on YouTube since 2007? That is a company laptop. Pointing that out. (singing) Critical Role! [water bubbling] [thunder] [explosion] (chanting) Role! Critical! Role! [dramatic Critical Role theme] Who brought a fucking parrot? Damn it, Jester. Perfect timing! You are a bit handsy sometimes. I mean, it's hard because I do pretty reckless things. I don't know. I honestly feel like everyone feels terrible about how that went, but you know, when you look at on the whole, we did okay. I believe her, actually. Yeah. Honestly man, when you did that you were totally alone and by yourself. It took us a minute to figure out what exactly had happened and what you touched. Jester. I hope you know, my intention wasn't to abandon anybody, especially not you. I thought I was going to have to activate the damn sphere and it was going to open up a portal or something. I didn't know it was going to immediately take me away from the fight. I'm sorry. I mean, I might have a part in it. I think that's true. I agree with that. That's a good point. What do we want? Yeah. Get off this godforsaken boat for a damn minute. Okay. Do I show them how? Am I first mate-y enough? You're talking about Bisaft? Wait, the Xhorhasians snuck under the mountains and attacked Felderwin? I frantically search for a bill that I probably don't have. I look at the dockmaster; I go Give me the bill. You're taking care of all of it? Did we have any--? His Grog is showing. Was there any money left on the ship from Avantika? So all the money we have is pretty much the money we have. Fjord. We might want to consider having a communal ship fund. We'll talk about it later. Breakfast! Caduceus. Come on, you're a foodie. Yeah, how much is a bottle? I think he wanted to try some mead, I wanted to try some mead, and then we wanted to buy some mead. Mm-hmm. Beau. Benth-- can I call you Ben? Bentha. Pleasure. Could you get it? I took 30 if you want to take the other five. Nothing. Just one. You found us again. This is the sixth time. You just know where we are. I know, but she was just-- we're in a restaurant. This is precisely why we didn't wake you up. Right, yeah. I pour her a very large glass of mead. (laughter) We were going to go on a winery tour. Fjord, what was that naval officer--? Sorry. What was--? What did that naval officer say to you about the war? What was I hearing? Does that freak anybody else out? SAM and It's not far from my hometown either. From Kamordah. (rustling noises) Yeah, but he said that they were traveling under the mountains, and Kamordah is a mountain town, so... They got under the mountains and attacked Felderwin. I think we should still go to the temple, though. Well, I'm just being paranoid. So we find the temple, and then what? I guess, go back to Nicodranas first, yeah? Yeah, we-- Yeah. I'd be mad at us, too. Oh, Yasha. It's the next sedan coming out. He decided to take some personal time to himself. Oh, a Tuesday? She holds up a handful of shreds. Just fucked up. I'm getting poor, you guys. I'm getting D&D poor. Do you not have bees in Xhorhas? Oh. Yeah, right. She's been collecting all those flowers. Do they have mushrooms? 30 gold feels like a lot right now. Just saying. (flashback riff) Each one is a Fireball. Fucking score. I go over to Caduceus and I pull him aside really quick. Hey Cad, I have a thought. As you may have heard, I have now become first mate. No, really? No one told you? Sure. I probably have. With that responsibility, I started thinking about the crew, and maybe we haven't been treating them the best that we could be. You know, I think they're okay. I don't think that we're abusing them, but maybe neglecting them? Anyway, I got this extra bottle of mead for them, and I thought maybe, with some of the stuff we got, maybe we could do a nice dinner for them or something to just show our appreciation. I really don't want to get stabbed in the middle of the night is what I'm thinking, so it's a little bit still selfish. But really don't want to die by one of these fuckers. Oh, a card! I didn't think-- you think they'd appreciate that? I could write that down, yeah. Good call. Thanks. I feel like a first mate should be astute. It does; you used it pretty correctly, I think. Deductive reasoning, you've got it. Nailed it, man, yeah. Good work. Okay, I'm going to go now. I start prepping the boat. He did. I was waiting for your response. I pay attention. Damn, could you be more ominous, Orly? Were you trying? I think he was trying. That was good. I think that was pretty good. Yeah, I was almost like Captain? O Captain! My Captain! Do you need me to stay up, Captain? Before I go to bed, I would like to talk to Jester, unless Jester is having some alone time and it doesn't seem like it's the right time. Oh, you're here keeping watch? That's a good call, actually. Going to stay up much longer? Yeah. Motion sick? It's a little spooky, right? It's fun, though. Listen, I wanted to talk to you for a moment. I'm not really good at this sort of thing, but about what you said last night, about being a good liar. You're right. You really are a good liar. Yeah. I think it takes one to know one. I think being a liar means when I know you're not, does that make sense? And when you are. Look, we all get sad. I want you to know that. I haven't told you really any of this, but I also had a lonely childhood. Yeah. I didn't have a lot of friends. My father was very protective because of certain things that he believed, so I wasn't allowed to have a lot of friends. Really any friends. Maybe. Maybe I would have turned out a little bit more like you. I admire that in you. In my loneliness, I got angry and turned to bad things, but in your loneliness, you turned to creativity. I think that's beautiful. I really do. Okay. Really? I don't think I've ever seen you angry. I'd like to see it someday. I'll be proud of that, too. Anyway, I know you like to look for friends. I don't know if I'm best friend material. That might be a lot of commitment, especially with my commitment of being first mate. It really is, but you don't have to look far for a friend. Anyway, I'll leave you to it. I hug her back from behind. Love you, Jes. Don't stay up too late. I head to rest. He gave me permission to. (singing) Celebrate! Sentinel, bitches! No, we just got that repaired. TALIESIN and Merry Christmas. 'Sup? What? Okay... (laughing) The Cadence family? (sharply inhales) Yeah! I was awake the whole night. The one we're heading in, Fjord, which is the only way we could be heading. Towards our destiny. (laughter) Orly, which way are we heading? Towards the islands. Thank you. So we just painted it-- To be fair, he's eaten some balls-- You busted a ball. That's true! I'm telling you, it's a ball-themed year. Sorry. You are searching for this based on a vision? Fjord, there are presumably three spheres, yeah? Right? You have one. You have two, and then Avantika. I'm checking if you think that this could unleash Uk'otoa. Okay. What if, theoretically, playing devil's advocate here, maybe Uk'otoa was like I should make four, one extra, just in case-ies. Vandran has that one, but he's also already put it in the temple, and this third one could unleash him! Maybe it only takes three? It's you? Am I doing this? I'll aid you. Are we in the middle yet? No carvings in caves, holes in the stone walls? Did you go underwater in your vision? Sorry. Go, Frumpkin, go! He made it worse. The water here is pretty clear. Why does this keep happening? We just woke up. Jagged tower seem familiar? Okay. Me and Caduceus again? Want to do separate rolls this time? Fucking horrible! Eight. They were like (menacing noises). Do you have the ability to let us breathe under there? It's cold already. (groaning) (yelling) That was for the crew! What?! Nott! Your flask is bottomless! Do we see her go and sneak the mead? If Uk'otoa decides to show up-- What's the plan? (doubtfully) Okay. Still cool. All right. SEALs dive! 12. Super middle of the road. Is it as dark as it was before? Equally? That's some Cthulhuian shit. Quietly. Quick and fast? The people? Are they for sure going to attack us? Bad? Super bad? There are five? Like seahorses. I will not go with Yasha because Sentinel and Sentinel. Okay. Next target, maybe? Natural one. Yeah. Five total for me. Dude, what? You rolled a two? Well, that makes sense. Oh, shit. Anyone in range? Oh! Yeah, I'll swim-- which one is closest? All of them? All four of them? I'll take that one. I'll swim. I will spend a ki point to do Swim of the Wind. Punch. Jesus Christ. Right, thank you, Jester! Ooh, that's much better. 18? I'll use my fist. It was a three plus seven, so ten? Second attack. Almost a natural 20, but it wasn't. 13? Oh, that's fun! Fuck, balls, shit, cock. Still hits. Five damage. Yep. We're rolling like garbage. You can call me Yasha. I'll take it. Miss. Second one hits. AC 19. It has a prehensile penis. Sorry. Miss! The one in front of me is dead. I head to the next one. How far away? Yasha's fine. I'll hit the one in front of me. First attack with disadvantage hits. That's a natural 14. I'm going to use my staff on this one. I hope he is fine with non-magical attacks. Eight damage. Did it look like he took the full damage? Mm-hmm. Sticks hurt. Next one, probably. 11? Oh! That's a lot. 12. It's still going? Flurry of Blows. Ki point. Two more hits. First one hits, barely, but hits with a 13. Mm-hmm! 11 damage. No, sorry, six plus four. Ten. I was looking at my wrong thing. Hits, and one more time. Please, die. Six. I do that thing where I try to water current its bloody guts away from me so I'm not inhaling it. D&D Beyond? Yeah! I'm good. What? Nein. I swim down. I mean, it feels like this stuff is always at the bottom or at the end. Can I-- because I've got shit when it comes to range-- cheat the distance and see if I can peek in from the top of the tower down? While they do this? Okay, 18. While you guys sink, I went and peeked through one of those windows and looked down. I do, too. Go ahead. You might roll higher than I did. I look at Yasha What do you think? Light or no? Okay. I go-- over to Caleb, and Yasha and I look in as he sends them in. But they're backing away from the light? How far up are Yasha and I from the floor? Yeah, we'll drop down and join Jester and co. Thanks, friend. I knew it! Weeks of sleep. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas.
