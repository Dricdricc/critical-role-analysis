It's Super Saiyan Goku! That's pretty great! He's got gold hair. Yeah, they're like best friend charms. Yay! Thanks, Loot Crate! You basically see it 30 seconds before everyone else. It does. It was like, okay, everybody pick your top three, and so we each picked six. And they were all different. And we're like, cool. What just came out? It's beautiful. I want to live here. It's amazing. Okay. Oh! I want to go see a thing. I want to go! I take off after Percy. Guys, look! They're fireflies! Okay. Okay. A 20. It's a ruin? Or are there walls that continue on? Interesting. Can I do a check to see if I can recognize who might've built this stone structure? Ten. Do they look like anything that we have on our plane? Can I do that? I won't touch it! I'm going to-- it's so pretty. Oh! A "feysy." Are they poisonous or anything like that? Can I touch it? I want to pick the little white flower. I take the flower and I put it back. I was going to press it and keep it. Maybe it's his version of a doorbell. You pick a plant and you get-- Oh, not bad. 21. Is he still conscious? She was very pretty. Are you okay? Okay. Maybe it'll wear off in a minute? She was very pretty. A parrot? And I whisper to Trinket don't crush the flowers. There are very large consequences for picking flowers. I'll go get your eyes back! Okay. I'm going to sit on the wall and watch for a second. Grog. Do you know how to float? Do you know how to float on top of water? You should do that. Right. Don't we want to talk to her? Yeah! I figured it went well for you the last time. You're the only one who's done this before. (stage whisper) Sorry! Sorry. I'm a huge fan is all. Hi. I'm Keyleth, by the way. Of the Air Ashari-- Oh right, for a hot second. But then she took Grog-- I Druidcraft a Tal'Dorei daisy and give it back to-- I didn't mean to hurt your flowers. Sorry. Can you not get it back? Do you have Regeneration on you today? I could attempt a Dispel Magic first. You could rock it for a while. It's located in a bog? Near the river of the Gilded Run? The Shademirk Bog. That's the one! Man, can you teach people how to do that? Because that's awesome. You know what? I'll talk to you later about it. I really like her, yeah. Any assistance is more than greatly appreciated. I sniff Percy. It's nice. It suits you. It's very masculine. It's a musk. As we walk away, I give Percy a wet willie. No, I give you a wet willie. It's not a ranged attack. I still don't say that's a ranged attack! Wet willie is happening! Consider that payback. (laughter) See, that is a ranged attack. You know, and to be fair, Barkskin, it's all right. Barkskin is temporary. Oh, the blindness? I don't know. Do you want to be healed or not, Percy? Jeez, first you say you're mad at me and then you ensnare my melee wet willie-- Wait. Percy. Say you're not mad at me anymore. Say Hey, I know I've done things in the past to piss you off-- Yes. Yeah. Are you going to hold this one against me because I picked a flower, like how you held the Clasp against me? Hold against me like the Clasp? It's okay. I come up from behind and give him another wet willie! See? I got you even when you had your eyes. All right, what? What? All right. We'll keep moving. 25. While we do that, I take Percy's Barkskin, and I regal it out. I give him moss epaulets, grow some flowers on it, give him a little Whitestone flower crown. I'm making him a fancy tree. It stays at a constant, correct? We are moving towards dusk, correct? We're moving towards the setting sun? She said it was two days' travel. Do I see any birds or anything like that in the sky? Any wildlife? Any critters? Sorry, 21. Yes, 21. What, things get prettier as they get older here? That's not fair. Damn it. Let's get back-to-back, shall we? I'm going to go back-to-back to the twins. He looks good, too, right? Yeah? Oh? (gasps) Teach you? I don't know! But I'd like to try. Yeah, that would be fun. Okay. Can I do something like that? See, the thing is, you have to get the accents right for each critter, or else they could get a little offended. Totally. I keep going. So one of the things that I like to do is embody the animal, and that can get you in the mindset. Let's practice being Trinket together. I go up to Grog. (sniffs, groans) I give her a thumbs up. The accent's really good. You're doing a good job. It's very good. Keyleth wipes away a little tear. I will turn around. How far away are we from the treeline? Yeah. We have been moving away. She said two days south. But you were saying she was using two days in a way that we would understand? We'll never find each other again. Do we still see the flashing light in the distance that she saw? Is it erratic? Amazing. Almost. Wait, maybe the bigger one? Look at you! Oh yeah, compare notes! What's the matter? Are you scared? Yeah, you guys should compare notes. Cross-references are always good. You could help us. The Hunk of Quall? It's expired. Can I go find his feather quill that he dropped? Okay. Oh man, he nailed you, Grog. Is this just your hobby? Your pastime? Or are you an actual records keeper for whatever town this is? Because both would be humorous. What's the name of this little town here that we see? And where do you live when Syngorn's not here? We're in the Feywild. Also a bath. We missed the sloth, so if anyone wants to bring out an otter, I'd be okay with that, too. That's so random, but I'm into it. You're going to get an e-mail tomorrow being like Matt. Guys, let's have a carpet picnic tonight. Can we have a carpet picnic? Because we're in the Feywild. It seems appropriate. I just thought it would be fun. Thank you! I sit down next to the satyr and I stare at him like this, a little bit. Do you shed? Do you grow a thicker coat during wintertime? Do you grow horns? That's awesome. Can I pet your fur? Is it coarse? Where do you steal these things? Are you a pickpocket? Are you not having fun? We want you to at least enjoy yourself. You must know something, or else you wouldn't stay out of it. Does it have a name? What's this called? But you'll take us to our final destination. Remember, you have to be nice to things in the Feywild. This is what we've learned. What is he doing? Not have him at all? The people we're stealing from better be meanies, though, and they better have deserved it at some point. Well, Garmelie also said they were strengthening up an army. Did they ever have a standing army before? I can help Percy. Can I help with a Mending spell? I thought I used it as a ritual spell before. I thought I learned it. I don't know. Can I use it as a 1st-level spell? Guidance, Druidcraft. I used Druidcraft before, for the wooden thing. Can I use Druidcraft to help this? What's it made out of? Is it made out of wood? We're Vox Machina. Yeah? Really? What happened? What did you feel? Okay. Yeah. I actually have Dispel Magic right now. I'll touch Vex and cast Dispel Magic and see if anything happens. Wait, take off all magical items first. Well, take it off. I don't want to risk dispelling anything. It's like wearing metal in a really hot sauna. You just don't do it. Come on. All right. I'll do the big guy. Come on, big guy. Oh, that's okay. My wisdom, just my modifier? 22. That was a very high wisdom roll. Do you feel anything? I can also try a Regeneration spell. I have a feeling if he shook your hand and did something, like Scanlan said, it's probably a Pike thing, like a Remove Curse. It's got to be something more like that. Mine is all nature-based. I can try to Regenerate you, but I don't think this would fall under that. I have a feeling it's like if you stray from a contract or something, you might feel it. I don't know. That's what I would think. I put a blanket over the satyr, and I pet him, now that he's asleep. Is his fur coarse, or is it soft? Okay, good night. Are you going to take a point of exhaustion for that? So you're close. Yeah, you're doing good. I sleep, and I dream of fireflies and the Feywild because it's so magical. Son of a fuck. Draw me like one of your French girls! This is brilliant. Wait, Scanlan, why do you look normal? I love it. You guys, we have a souvenir! We have a souvenir from the Feywild! What are you going to do? You fascinate me. No. We did that for you. Do not abuse this. That's right. What happened to don't hurt or touch anything in the Feywild? As he pouts, I Druidcraft a little flower crown for him. He's so fun to mess with. Wait. Take and roll up the painting, the charcoal drawing that he did and put it in the Bag of Holding. Will it stay in the mansion? But I know things will also get ejected from the mansion. Okay, I'll leave it. Vex? Should we be dressing for the occasion? Should we put on our nice cloaks? Yeah, cloak me. Our nice cloaks. I'll cloak up. Try and look like I made some sort of effort. I'll do a little cantrip Gust over top of us to make one of those air umbrellas that would never work in real life. Mandrakes? Oh, cool. 21. I look up on the wall. Is it coming from archers on the wall? Not quite a warm welcome. Poo! Syldor. Such a dipshit.
