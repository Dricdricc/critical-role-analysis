All the video games. Yeah, your sweet shirt. Are we? I'm so glad someone wrote that down for us! You're active? Stay active. Critter shirt. All right, who did we send to Alaska? Who was that? Was that Flo Rida? Bulldog! Pitbull! Pitbull! (laughing) Pitbull. He played in, like, a Wal-Mart in Anchorage. A Wal-Mart in Anchorage, or something like that. Yeah, respect. Like 50 people showed up. And got a private-- Yeah. Yeah. (laughs) So gorgeous. Well, we've seen it tiny. Now or never and then it goes away forever. It's so gorgeous. You're so sexy. Pike in that three-point landing! And they are movie-poster size. They are that size. 24 x 36. If you scroll down, there'll be a button. Scroll down, there's a button. Thank you, Joe! Yeah, by us. Yes. (laughs) No. Oh, yeah, Library Bards. Nice. Yeah, man. Let's dive. My best friend. Yeah, what time is it? Want to go check in at the Slayer's Take? All right. Okay. What's your name? Oran? What? Loran. So we have seen this guy before? Sure, that exist. Have you ever encountered a dragon personally, Loran? Uh-huh. Sure. Yeah. Yep. Nope. Yeah, Team Half-Elf. Yeah! Yeah. Oh, wait, keep the teeth. Keep enough teeth for us. I have an idea for teeth. Yeah, you might have heard about him. Umbrasyl... (chuckles) Yes, we have. Yes. All right. (laugh) Okay, hang on. We know it's here. There aren't that many white dragons walking around-- Certainly not anymore. We know it's here. Why don't we sleep on it. Think about it. If we're ever in a pinch for money, we can come back. Oh, wait, Vanessa. Wait. That's me. Where's the temple of the Raven Queen? Okay, bye. We should drink those. To be fair, Percy, you do a lot to remind us to try not to forget that you're titled. Those are probably bad. Good idea. I like that. Percy? Do you still have that raven's skull I gave you? All right. Oh, I was going to say "giving." Sorry. Angry. I'm not here. I can. Not today, but I can over time. Yeah, yeah yeah. He's just not home. Sorry, guys. Victor's on vacation. (whispering) Hey, Pike. (whispering) I think Vax is talking to himself. Yeah. It's gorgeous. It's very intimidating. Do you know anything about this? You've lived here for a while, Pike. Never been in? Can we recognize the language in which the runes come from? What did you say the name was of the Raven Queen's temple, again? Raven's Crest? Okay. I turn to Vex. I swear to you. We're all coming out of here alive. But if like an hour passes and we don't, maybe come in? But we're all coming out of here alive, so don't worry about it. It's fine. We've faced way more terrifying things than a few albeit creepy men in robes. It's dark? Like an interrogation room? Like one-way mirror type of thing? Do I get the sense as a druid, as an Ashari, that we've switched into another plane? Oh! I rolled a 19. (laughs) 21. Oh goodness gracious. Do you need anything before you go in? Any enhancement of any kind? Okay. I just kind of squeeze his hand. We're right out here on the other side of this door. If anything terrible happens, you have the earpiece. No one will stop Pike and I from getting through there if something terrible goes wrong. Rules be damned. I guess we'll wait, yeah. I stand at the bottom of the stairs and I watch. I walk over. You look well. What did she say to you? Did she speak to you at all? (shocked laugh) Do you believe? Is that what she told you, that this was fate? Why? I don't know. As someone who is constantly questioning mine, I don't think I'm the right person to ask. But I do know one thing-- and I grab his hands-- you were amazing and talented and special way before she found you. If anything, we can call her a god. We can also call her a great opportunist. She didn't give you anything special. The Vax that I see before me right now is no different than the Vax that I saw before me ten minutes ago. I'm not saying that what you experienced wasn't real and true. I believe you whole-heartedly. Is it what was meant to be or what you just really wanted? And it found you? He talked to her. They didn't let us in the room. We stood outside. He didn't talk much about it. Maybe you can find out more. All he said was that he knows that this was fate. Oh. Yeah. Well, that's one way of looking at it. (giggles) Is that Riegel? (giggles) Yes! Yes! Is it like one of those old-school leather helmets? Oh, football! Yeah. Okay! Cool. Yes. (laugh) Yeah. (laughs) I'm so excited for the art! (laugh) That's like another 12 inches to you. You look so tall. Oh, yeah, go! Go! Go! Go, Pike! Go, go! Yeah! He might have saw the face of a god. Yeah. Ritual? Communion? Oh no, Taliesin... Please inspire. Oh my god, it's a 10! I get excited. Sorry. Plus 10. Oh, sure. I was thinking Go-Go-Gadget Finger. That's right, DM. (laughs) (laughs) Oh, shit. (laughs) Yes, yeah, just give him an anime weapon. And get your Joe Mad poster! Right now, pre-order. Oh, and giveaway! (laughs) Yeah, and a high-five. We did talk about the Feywild. One of the Vestiges is in Marquet. Hang on. Cabal's Ruin, which is a magic-devouring cloak-- (whispering) Okay, I'll speak quietly. There's apparently a magic-devouring cloak who is being worn by the-- it's in Ank'Harel. It's being worn by... A merchant warrior with a missing eye. So, technically, we don't even have to head towards the Feywild. Do you guys remember how I kind of did that thing with Grog's evil sword and kind of banished it away for forever? No. Right. No, we're not bringing it back. I can do that with the rest of us. No, it's not like a banishment. I can Plane Shift us wherever we want to go, to an alternate plane. Yeah, we just hold hands and think about it really hard. Yeah. It's druid magic. It's great. I can take us to where we've been before, to where it's familiar. Very briefly. It is somewhere I am familiar with, I believe, through means that I am familiar... In general terms. Such as "City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire." No. If you guys want to go to the Plane of Fire, that's like, a hike and a jump through a hole. All right. Yeah, I can get us there. It's very big. I imagine we'll figure it out once we get there. What about me? Team Half-Elf, yeah. Question. Hmm, okay. It says the Wrath of the Fey Warden is what we're looking for, the bow, and that it now acts as the heart of a cancerous tree, corrupting the verdant land. Is there something I can do, maybe try and... It says offline? Guys, I'm so glad we won DND. We beat it. Can I maybe sense a sick tree? You know what? Let's go to Whitestone. Let's go to Whitestone and drop some stuff off. Yes, they have something underground already. All right. Bless you. The Water Ashari live in the Ozmit Sea. No, I think they've got an island. Really? How familiar are you with the sea? A blade forged from metal pulled from the Far Realm, it was the center of many dark rituals. Have I heard about an island of glass? Have Pike or I heard of an island of glass? All right. I rolled a natural 1. Guys, water isn't glass, that's stupid. You rolled a 20? Oh, go Pike! Team ones. Whoo. What's the story of The Shrew? It was really bad. You know what, Grog? We will put that in our back pocket and we will think about it. We don't need an airship. When we kill all the dragons... We'll buy it with all of the gold that we've stolen from all the dragons. It'll be great. We're going to Whitestone. (repeats piercing spell noise) Through a tree! Can I do something? While I'm in the tree, can I do something? "I missed you. "Have you heard of this whole cancerous tree situation "in the Feywild?" Shh, no. I'm in the middle of the tree. I'm in the tree. Aww. I step out of the tree. I'll talk to him later. I don't know. Let me find it. Yeah. He told us. Yeah, he's got a tramp stamp. Oh, are we all going down to the ziggurat? Sure. Aww. How is Whitestone finding you? Sure. Hi, Gilmore. I give him a hug back. Oh, before dinner, I think we were all just curious on the state of the... ziggurat, as we were calling it. Spinning orb of death, is what we call it. All right, yeah, sure. Back to your old self. I go to Vex and Pike and go, "Is this a good opportunity for us to break out our formal wear?" Okay. The ladies take, like, 20 minutes. Not the Feywild. But maybe soon. (laughing) Yes, yes, yeah. Hang on, what exactly did he say, by the way? Circle back. Treat proposals like we do our dungeons? (laughs) We circle back. (giggles) I understand that. I don't know if that's a good reason to say yes, though. Yeah, what is with that? I didn't know that was possible. I don't know. Yeah, no, and then I feel really-- Right! And you kind of think about it for a second and you entertain it, and then you feel really gross about yourself. No! Of course it's not gross if you're actually interested. Wait, what? I know! And we've been through so many uncomfortable things together. Most of life is so uncomfortable. Be comfortable right now. We understand. You look so cute. LAURA, ASHLEY, AND I do a little air cantrip to make the skirt poof out. Hey, do you guys mind tying me up a bit? Nice and tight. (grunts) (strained) No, but that means it's right. All right, I'm good. We look fabulous. Yes. We do. (laughs) 2 pm. Allura! Kima. Keyleth goes over and gives her a hug. It's only for a few hours. Don't worry about it. So nothing survives the transfer. It is destroyed into its... purest components, it sounds. To be fair, Grog, I might have tried that, a little. I sort of stuck my hand in the spinning ball of death and let's just say I'm glad I'm still here standing with you all. It did a considerable amount of damage to my hand and definitely felt like it was sucking me in and I had to resist pretty hard. But it seems like anything that goes in that sphere doesn't come out the other end intact. It's for their own safety. Yeah. My choice is The Unmentionables. I like it. The rivers are called the Gilded Run? And the Shademirk Bog pours out of the tree? The tree is responsible for a swampy bog. Joran the what? So much so that she could almost pass as a druid wielding natural magic? I want to kill her so hard. (strained) I want her to die. I mean, I'm sure there is something bigger than Thordak, probably in the Fire Plane, but the Fire Ashari closed the portal. That was the portal that Thordak came out of. It ripped apart my entire-- Well, Allura, how did you lock him in the Fire Plane to begin with? All right. So, that's all good. But he did escape. Exactly! That was my question! (laughs) So these heart-stones embrace the essence of where they reside? And he has the heart-stone of the Fire Elemental Plane living inside of him. A heart-stone. Right. So you're thinking the Chroma Conclave was simply a temporary alliance? We can use this. Turning them against each other is not a bad idea. So we can take-- yeah. Do you know exactly how these heart-stones are forged? Oh, that's right. It was good to see you. (laugh) (whispering) It's not great, though. It stands. Home is where you make it, Kima. We do. Let's go get you a bow. I have one thing I'd like to do. I want to go back to our little cave that we dug out under where the Sun Tree is. Is that still there? I want to go there, and I want to kind of sit down and meditate for a second. And I want to cast Speak With Plants and have a little chat with the Sun Tree. I reach out and I touch the roots. Can I just kind of feel, sense the arcane ley-lines that Allura was talking about that the tree's in the center of? Okay. So I just reach out, touch the tree, and say, "Hey, old friend. "How are you feeling? Doing better?" You're pretty cool, Sun Tree. Hey, Sun Tree? I was just wondering if you knew-- if you could tell me anything about this terrible cancerous tree in the Feywild, if you knew anything about it? He might be like your brother or something. No! No, okay. There's this tree in the Feywild and it might have a man living in it called Fenthras. No, sorry, that's the name of the bow, the bow is in it, named Fenthras, and it might be a really sick tree. Can you tell me where there's a really sick tree, maybe in the Feywild? "Barkeley!" Hey, Sun Tree? You apparently kind of live in the middle of all these arcane ley-lines of the world. How far do those stretch? Can you kind of give me a rough idea? Do they go to the other side of the world? Can you stretch all over the world? Who? Pelor? Right. So you're not a natural tree, you're a tree from the gods? All right. Well, anyway, you're really awesome, Sun Tree. Yeah, you're so cool. Okay, so it was good talking to you. I'll walk through you soon. Okay, bye. And then I leave. (snorts) (snorts) (laughs) Oh my god! No! Nooo! Is it a rakshasa? What the fuck?! Has he been a rakshasa the whole time? Wait, is it the rakshasa who's different? Is it not Gilmore? So many questions! LIAM AND Right! Why is it always you? Hang on, wait. Oh, wait, did you get the final blow in the rakshasa in the Slayer's Take? But he was dead. What the fuck is going on?! No, because I'm not a psycho. I can see chopping someone's body up might be psycho.
