Going to have blood pressure issues after this. Is that on melee attacks, or all attacks? Who is it, though? 21. Can you move Keyleth to where Percival was? That's amazing. Can you see this, Ash? Ash, I'm going to take a picture and send it to you. Don't fuck me, Gil. Hey, not bad! 17. Oh my god, this is awful. You've got to be fucking kidding me. Oh yeah, did everyone pop their blessings? I get to add plus four right, because we're blessed? 21. 67? Are you serious? Yeah. He ordered these. They are cake stands and I was like, oh are these for our wedding cake? And he was like-- Cake of fucking death. I can't believe this. Is it floating, like a gravitational state? It should still be able to work, yeah, theoretically. 19. Yeah, the whip is down. I love that from his perspective, you were like, "If the whip hits the floor, come after us." (footsteps) (yelling) (crashing) So it looks like those electro-touchy balls? What are those called? Casualties of war. Are you in the Maze of the Abyss? You're in the Endless Maze of the Abyss. You got to be. It's another plane. You got something for that, right? Yeah, but I think he gets two or three legendary actions per turn. Did he do a Flame Strike? Take it! (laughs) Take the dark purple, moody one! Or I should have given you a different one. Oh, that heart disease! It's the number one killer! We're not afraid of this! Nine? I'm sure I'm flushed. He's immune to lightning. Okay. Thank god. I think Grog is by Vex, yeah? I'm going to cast my 6th-level Bones of the Earth. It creates six at 120 feet distance. Five feet wide, 30 feet high. So I'm going to see where Grog is-- Oh, shit! That's right. Is this useless for me to do right now? Okay, I'm going to scratch that. I'm going to scrap that right now. I am going to do an 8th-level Sunburst right in his face. 12d6. He's probably got a stupid constitution. No, he's taking it. He takes 12d6 and he is blinded for a minute. But he's got True Sight. Well, he takes 12d6 radiant damage, which is cool. Come on, big money! I am again. Okay, so that's six, (counting). That was almost a six! My finger fucked it up. (counting), 45 points of radiant damage. I really hope I didn't kill another kid. Fuck you. (laughter) Man, I was just starting to get over that first kid. Not that I would ever get over-- I'm going to use my bonus action to cast a Healing Word at 2nd-level on myself. And then I'm going to take whatever breath I have left and say Pike! Ouch, hurting. I'm hurting. I'm going to move up a bit, near Trinket. Behind Trinket, I want to be close to Pike still. We've got to get Grog back. Grog has a trammel. How can you tell? Just on the cusp. You have to save yourself so you can help us! That's so horrible. That's not good. I'm under 100 hit points. I can try and save it in time. Can I add my inspiration to that? Saving throw, right? I have advantage because it's a spell, right? I have advantage against spell saves? Intelligence save. If he fails the-- I am not a vegetable. You sweet, sweet man. Goddamn it. He's probably looking at you, Scanlan. You have the book! We can't lose you! For real! War Caster. Come on. Don't fall to oblivion, please? Jenga. Come on, Grog! Oh no. It's okay. Now Becky won't know I was talking shit about her. I think it was the weird echo-y sound of Ashley's pages turning. What do you have? What did you forget? Druid die and don't fuck me, Gil. Don't fuck me, Gil. Well this one fell off. I mean, it was a floating three. Oh, no. It's a 13. No. This isn't good. 15 plus my intelligence. Oh, wait my intelligence. Oh, and I'm trained in-- Okay, wait. What did I just say? 17 plus eight. 25. Hang on. Can I use my inspiration too? Yeah, okay, I'm good! Plus a six. 31. I can take it. I asked you tell me what to do. If it was cocked or not, you just stared and went like this. You were thinking? What would you have claimed? LIAM and I don't want to get targeted later, Matt! I want you to treat me fairly, okay? I mean on the internet! I mean from people being pissed at me. On the internet. Miss. Hits. Are you coming back? Come back, come back! Don't kill J'mon. You're going to use two to try and do it? Percy in the house. Oh, my god. Already. Oh, my god. You're still fucking gone. 40 feet. Then I am going to burn my 9th-level Shapechange. I'm going to turn into a planetar. Pulling this ripcord. And that's my action, right? I can move as the planetar? Okay, I'm going to fly my 120 feet move speed and come behind over here-ish, but in the air. All right, a little bit over, that's workable. Yeah. I mean, I don't think I can do a bonus as a planetar, right? No. We've got to get Grog back. Crit on a 19. Oh my god, you and the 19s! Crit on a 19! Come on. Bring him back. I think 60 feet. We're like an 80s B-level fantasy movie right now. Oh, yeah, Vlad the Impaler him. Oh, my god, amazing. Well you roll, and then you double what you roll. So roll big! Come on! Is it? Whoa! We need to start getting some trammels in him, I think, y'all. Are you down? Are you looking rough? Yeah. It is? I get advantage on spell saves, right? Spell save, right? 21. 61 and 71? Oh, I have resistance against bludgeoning as a planetar. No, it carries over. Oh, that's magical! That was rough. And now you can't. Okay. I mean, I would want that if I was a god. Definitely put that on the list. You don't crit on a 19? He's beauty pageant crying. That's you! That's fucking you! Here's some too. How many penises have you seen? I'm a flyer, so I'm good. She's distracted. She's like (yells) right now. Okay, in my buff Michael Fassbender, but as a hot chick kind of way, I look down and I go Grog! The gymnast thing! Whoosh. And I swoop down, my speed. But I'm buff, and I'm bigger! I'm going to scoop him up if he can do a little jump and whoosh. 24 strength. Okay, that's fine. I rolled a nine plus seven, so 16. Going the rest of my movement, which you said I used 40 feet? 50? So I have another 70 feet of movement. Can I use my bonus to dash a little further? Can I, because you held your action. Can I get up there and give him the cheerleader, like the figure skater, Go, Grog! And see if I can do the, you know? What's the reach on your thing? Can I have him on my shoulder, you know, once again like the cheerleader thing? Ready, go! Okay! Can you use your chain as a grappling hook? I'm sorry. It changed! The battlefield changed immediately. Is that the same roll? Drop it like it's hot. If we straight kill him, that's no good? That's not good. I need a full 100, what about you? And you need more than a hundred. But she has plenty left over. Percy and Sam need more than a hundred. You have a trammel, right, Pike? Are we trying to get all three trammels in in one round? I'm afraid he's going to try and yank them out. Did you have something? There's a lot you can do when you're falling! That was the worst blue balls ever. It gives us a good answer. So if we got two in, then he would have to save over 20, so he would have to roll a ten or higher. We have a 50/50 shot if we get two in him. Yeah, but he can still save from it if he rolls a 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20. 50 hit points a round? Oh wait, you already did your action. How far away is he now? From where we moved? So how far away are we now, roughly? We were up under him a little bit. If you want to hold again, I can get you up there next. If you want to hold your attack action. I can get you in melee range this time. I can maybe, I can do an arc and do a droppy thing on him? How epic would that be if they ran back in? Advantage against spell saves, yeah? Dex? 20. Resisted, so-- 72, so 34, 35? Thank god we healed. We would've all been dead. You're feeding me a potion? Hey babe-- (gagging) You fed me a superior? Okay, 8d4s. What constitutes as low? 131. Why are they all around Scanlan? Percy's there! You're not going to kill another of our friends in front of us, are you? Joe, don't die. Gives you wings! (singing) The bros are back in town! Okay. Still in our synchronised swimming stance, I fly up and-- I'm going to drop Grog onto Vecna and then do my own thing. Can I give him a little bit of a boost? Okay! Oh man, it took 114 episodes that we finally have a title name drop in our show. It's a critical roll. Don't forget your blessings! Okay. So after he does that, Keyletar is going to swing around and find another one of those openings and I'm going to take my greatsword and do my multi-attack and jam it right into one of his openings and open it up a little wider. Got to get it nice and good. Okay. Getting it nice and good! Okay, so first attack-- opal dice, don't fuck me. You always fuck me. 18. Yeah, on attacks too! (gasps) 22? We learned something! Second attack, got to roll better than a fucking four! That definitely hits. Okay. 4d6 plus seven, and then I get 4d6. I don't do this normally. Okay, six, ten, 15 plus another 5d8 radiant damage. Mm-hmm, because I'm a planetar! Not bad! Eight, five is 13. Another seven is 20. Ones, not for sword damage. 22 and another six, 28! All right. That's my turn, I guess. Stop. Trammel time! Who are you fighting? The zombies? Yas, grit, yas. Get it, son! No, shut your mouth. Which is hot. The most expensive healing potion. 8d4 plus eight. On you? Good call. Across states, yeah. That's good. Is this a spell, so I have advantage, as well? 16 plus seven. 23 still doesn't succeed? I take the full 49? 41. No. I'm resistant to radiant. Holy shit. Pike, Grog, and Vax. For melee? Melee hits? I got one on him. Everyone's remembering their blessings and all the cool shit they do? Pike, you have a cool blessing. Is it doing everything? You fly and you heal better. You're pretty good. Jocks Machina. Come on, Grog. Oh my god, we've started this. Oh, Pike is after Scanlan. Scanlan could hold his action. Currently, 81 as a planetar. You have Death Ward going. And you're blessed. Goddamn. I don't know what to do, man. Can we survive one more round? Because if not, I can grab that thing from your belt and try to go for it, Pike can get there in time, and he can do the thing. If not, we try and survive one more round for you to get it in. I'm nervous I'm going to fuck this thing up. I've got plus seven to my strength. I've got to roll 13 or higher. But he gets advantage. Strength checks? (nervous laughter) I know. Ugh, my deodorant wore off a little bit ago. Am I taking yours, Grog? Are we going to try this? Okay. All right. I reach over into Grog's belt, grab out the trammel, and the hole that's there-- I was working at the one on the shoulder, so I'm going to go for the one I've been working on. Rappel over, grab it, and then rappel back in. Here's the thing. Either we do this and we try and get all of them in, and then you get it at the end of your round, or else we've got one more round. Oh my god. I hate this so much! Do you want to give me one of your dice? It's your trammel. One of your die? Is it a d4? Is it an attack? Oh my god. I turn, and grabbing Vax's die, I look over my shoulder at him. Oh my god. I hate this so much. A three, so ten. If we get two in, he has a 50-50 shot. Bonus action. I'm a planetar. I don't have bonus actions. Wait, you're not going to hold your turn? And then you'll hold your action? I thought you were going to hold your action so you could read the book after Pike did the trammel? I would have given Grog the trammel, dude! Oh my god, Scanlan. You're still alive? Why have we not made fun of you for that way more throughout the years? Did John have a dead pool on when it was going to fall? That would have been my bet. We know a kitten has one hit point. Wait, five? Two hit points? A kitten's worth? A kitten's worth of hit points. But you're gone, so that sucks. Okay, you have the trammel. No, Pike has the trammel. Scanlan, how many hit points do you have? Do I do more damage to this guy, or do I heal Scanlan? Pike, what about you? You all right? Scanlan's got the book. Fuck. Yeah, I'm going to fly down and do a healing touch on Scanlan. You've got the fucking book! 39 plus three, so 42. You get 42 hit points. Yeah. And you are freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness. And I'm going to use the rest of my movement to go up and get in Vecna's face, as well, and be like, what's up? Oh hey, we're pulling an Alfred Hitchcock right now! Birds. Birds! I'm John Cena. This is my favorite mini game! Can you bring that third trammel back? You get to ask your god for something awesome. The fact that none of us are dead. Fuck that hand. And how far can he go? He's trying to run away, trying to teleport away. (whoops) That's right, you used your Wish last night. The trammels are in. We're all before you. Just tell us what your hit points are. I would be dropping my planetar shape which is making me fly right now. Okay. Yeah. I'll take the other side that Arkhan has not. Grab the other side of him and try and grapple him, leaving him open and available for Scanlan. I'm a planetar. If I drop this, then I fall. What am I doing? Athletics check? Oh, I had bonuses to saving throws that I didn't even fucking realize. It's pretty good. 23. I don't even know what I have that would make him burn it. I don't really have anything. I don't think he would go for it. A full round. It's an arcane thing though, right? That was what I was asking. None of us are, unless you are, Arkhan. So we have to hold this motherfucker down for a round? Hang on, is it something I can do as a planetar that can read all languages and is also telepathic? Yeah. I can read all languages as a planetar. Okay. I have it now. For no reason. Oh my gods. Oh my Pelor. Oh my Sarenrae. 4th-level Banishment on Scanlan? Come on, charisma. It didn't help for me earlier; I rolled a three. I use my action to go fetal. That's under a hundred, though. The fuck is that? (air horns) Okay. I fly down over Scanlan's shoulder and attempt to read the damn book. With antlers. Always antlers. Do I get anything? What do I do? I've got inspiration and d4, right? He saves. What does that mean? It's always good or bad. [music] We all spoon each other as a winged spooning circle while holding Scanlan while holding the book. Same. Holding on desperately. Wait. What? Oh my god. Oh my god. All right, you know. Yeah. Don't congratulate him! Don't encourage that! We learned it from watching you. Yeah, everyone. In another form. Can read all languages.
