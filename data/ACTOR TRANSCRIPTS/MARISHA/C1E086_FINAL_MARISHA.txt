It's an ARG, I know it! My subscription went up three dollars? Aw. (all laugh) Worse. It's gonna be cold. Yeah! Amy Dallen had her episode. It's great. This week is Eric Campbell coming up in the run. And you should go-- (airhorn noises)-- and you should go watch 'em. Yeah, where does that end? Once you stop-- once you pop you just don't stop-- oh god, now it's a Pringles reference. Okay, go watch Signal Boost! Not boosted on the Signal Boost. But could be! New shows! Yeah, it's not a news show. We watched Jurassic World and Suicide Squad. We wanted to get caught up on our, like-- -- questionably bad movies. My favorite is Rick Flag just shouting exposition through Suicide Squad and that's his purpose. Oh! That's a better Valentine's Day. Yeah! You have spawn. They'll be holding your hand, you know, in later years. This is my child. This's what I've accomplished. I know, you've been great, man. She's been working on Talks Machina, kicking ass. Really, yeah. We love you! Key word is 'try'. Mainly by avoiding death at this point. Yeah. The bag of holding. Sure, it was like a long 'a' like a Vaaax. Â We don't know. Yeah, we took both. Lots of body parts. Yes. Yes. That's great. He's from Dias-where? Diastock. Dia-- --stock. Truscan? Wait! You're not related to the Briarwoods, are you? Have you ever heard the name Briarwood before? That's true. Especially these days. Kind of sounds like your upbringing, Percy. God! Oh jeez. I know. Tary, do you feel like we look healthy and sane to you? It's fine, you can be honest. Yes. So, what do you hope to accomplish at the end of completing all these tasks, you know, slaying a dragon? What do you want in the other end? Oh. Keyleth just gets a nosebleed, and she's not sure why. Oh yeah. It's true, she's actually very correct. Does anyone not understand, we had a mission here that we just completed? We just did it! Wait, J'mon? I am not taking him to J'mon. We're like specially, you know, trained. And proven ourselves warriors. We got permission to see-- You did good, Grog. Good job. Tary G. Besides, things just seem to happen around us. So if you just hang out long enough, I'm sure someone's gonna want to beat our ass over something. Go to the post office. Check our P.O. box. I want to live in that world! Irritated? Or was inferior the word you were looking for? Vexed, that's a good word. I know. Percy, Percy. Look, you can turn this to your advantage. Brain drain him for all the knowledge you can! All right. I trust your judgement. Oh, he's definitely a douchenozzle. (gasps) I think that's the first time I said douchenozzle. Yeah he called you 'little elf-girl and little elf-boy'. I don't like him. What's wrong with my antlers? I know my hair's shorter so it makes my antlers look bigger, which I was concerned about. Is it okay? Thanks? All right, you know what? Let's move off this conversation. Dottie. Were pen pals a thing for you? Is that why you like penmanship? No? Did you have any friends? Ever? Aww... Really? And they're still alive? Weren't killed in some crazy raid, or... eaten by dragons or...fell in a pit of lava? I thought we got it back, though. Wait, no. Are we talking about the flute? I have his flute because I picked it up last. Fuck! We need to speak with him. And return this I show the flute. Maybe they'll recognize it? I take it and I dust the ash and drug use off of it. And then-- I guess not? Howarth. Howarth. Howarth. Howarth. It's been going around. It's true, yeah. Anytime you fly. Might be a good trial run. I want to save traveling the Ozmit Sea and heading to the water Ashari for when Pike is back. So, yeah. No, we're speaking insanely literally right now. That's what's impressive about it. And we're taking you with us. It's true. Wait what? All right, let's go. So we're going back to Whitestone? Come on, Doodee. You have six seconds! Are you feeling nauseous? Oh my god, did you guys hear that? He thinks I'm a god. Doucher! Douchenozzle, that's right! That's what it was. Sorry, I'm just learning it. Yeah, yeah. In years ago. Castle courtyards. You can trust Grog for some things. I agree! You've never played Boulder, Paper, Shears?! (all laugh) Boulder, Parchment, Shears. Non-lethal. I'm getting in on this! I watched him walk up behind him and do it. I knew what he was doing. This is a part of our Vox Machina hazing. This is what we do! Wow, it sounds like us last week. In. I want to make decisions. No, I'm in. 16. Okay, first and foremost I'm going to create a windwall, around us, like an arena. Yeah. (wind swirling) And then I'm gonna-- Yeah, I turn to Percy and I say man, you know, I almost feel bad for the guy. Should I give him a boost? Should we give him an incentive? All right, we'll start with a boost. And I give him a healing word. We'll give him a level two. I guess you're worth it. Oh, you got real lucky Tary. I got a four and a three, which adds to be seven. Plus... 13 points. And then I say come on, Tary! You at least split his head. Yeah. 23. Show me what you got! Can you do the chargey thing? Oh, that's cool. That's cool. Right. If you've vaporized me, I'm going to be real pissed. Yeah. New kid's got game. What the fuck is that? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah, that Prismatic Spray was impressive. What are you gonna do? Yeah. (sighs) Should I make this more interesting? What haven't we tested yet? We haven't really seen him dodge yet, right? See how well he can dodge. And I throw a Fireball. (explosion) Right next to Tary. I don't wanna mess up Grog. Just Tary and Doty. Make a wisdom saving throw? Why? Because... The fuck did you do? I got-- oh, Sanctuary. Against spells? Even though this is an AOE? Any attack or spell. All right. So, let's roll this one. Not great. That's not great, but luckily I got really high wisdom. So, 18. Ow, jeez, oh my God. There's like-- There was like a little twinge. I think I was-- No, it's this guy. I think it's Tary. Wait, where's my-- Who stole my book? Fireball! I need to know what Fireball does. What is it? 8d6? I got it. One-- one, two... Seven. 34 damage. So he did not dodge, though, right? You sure? I drop the wind wall. No, no, this isn't war. This is great, we were just giving him a little trial run. Isn't that right, Tary? Isn't this great? He's fine. We knew that as soon as you said you wanted to rescue a damsel. We never-- no. You notice we tend to make a lot of people cry? We make a lot of people cry. We told him we were gonna go see Hotis and defeat him in the Nine Hells, and we wanted to make sure he lived. Yeah, look at him. Honestly, if you would've led with daddy issues, we probably would've trusted you. No. We just learned that Tary's an ugly crier. We can't beat him over the head after that. I guess we could go ahead and head to the Water Ashari. It should be fairly calm. Look, we're all fuck-ups. We like people who show their vulnerabilities. Or a douchenozzle. Too much? Okay. There are other ways of being a hero than being an adventurer. There are a lot of ways you could be a hero. Yeah. People who spend a lot of their earnings and people who are more privileged, like you, who help people in less privileged places. Yeah. People generally like them. I can cast spells, and so can Vex, here. It's through my antlers, so respect the antlers. Respect. We could do a little roleplay exercise, like in your stories. Full disclosure. Full disclosure, Tary, there aren't many damsels you have to rescue in the wild. I've learned mainly because women in the world have to be tougher. So that doesn't happen very often. But, if you want, we can make pretend and do a little thought exercise, and I'll pretend to be in distress and you can rescue me if that'll make you feel better. Yeah, but you have to vanquish Grog. Okay! (all laugh) Yes! Yeah! And look, you singed a little of my hair! Yeah! Yeah! Get drunk and make people cry. Pike, I have to eventually go visit the Water Ashari, but I didn't want to do that without you. Is there any advice you can give? All right. Okay. Aw. That was a good exercise in restraint, Grog. Proud of you. So how long have you been set forth on your little mission to prove yourself worthy? Welcome aboard the proving-yourself train. (gasps) Wow, your dad really is an asshole. What? Marion Darrington. (laughs) Maria. She's a maid Marion. That's fun. I'm concerned-- I'm sorry, I'm confused. Tary. That was a Freudian slip. Why does your father think it's important to have brute strength and combat experience to run a business? Are you sure your father's a real estate agent? That's a long walk to get to shithead. What's your father's name? I removed it. I burnt it off of him. Hashtag Clasp. Interesting. You know, Percy is a bit of a tinkerer himself as well. Built it on our little summer vacation. Did he just give us an IOU? Legally? Maybe? I think more than a few. Do you want us to excuse the two of you? All the people who tend not to like people are liking him. I feel like the two of you never like the same person. I thought we were taking a break from risk-taking for a second. I love the way you frame things, Percy. I love the way you lawyer your way out of every situation. I could check in on him. Haven't used the scrying eye today. I'm gonna look. I take out the scrying eye. What? Why? Boulder, parchment, shears. Why? We just want to make sure he's okay. He can't know if I'm scrying on him. Not if I use my scrying eye. All right. Deposit the checks. We haven't had the night off in a while. Pike wants to go. All right. All right. Do I know roughly where the water ashari are? Not in Whitestone. I think we're pretty landlocked. Is there like a port at the very south end of the continent, to where we could hop a ship and also do some research? Stillben? Oh, western. Oh you mean western. Okay well then, hang on. If it's w-- Nope. 'Cause the Earth Ashari are on the eastern side of the continent. Right? Of our fake world-- So Emon is like-- So we might as well leave out of Emon. And then I could also do some research, because-- Is the libraries and the lyceums and stuff open again? Or are they just fucking demolished? Yeah, unfortunately, I can't-- I've never been there. And the Ashari are a very reclusive type people. Have you read about the Water Ashari and the Ashari people? (whispering) Sam. Do you wanna touch my antlers? Ignore that, that got weird. I mean, I guess I could always go back to the Earth Ashari, or the Air Ashari, and talk to some of those people. I don't know. I guess we could go back and talk to the Earth Ashari. You guys haven't been there yet. Yeah, all right. Right now, with it being the Season of- Oh. We'd have to hike to get there? No, there's gotta be trees that I can Tree Stride there to. We're druids, there's gotta be trees within that camp, right? And stuff? Like, nearby? Okay. Oh my god. He doesn't know any of our names! We're like a bad speed dating session. Holy shit. Oooh! He's still got it! No! No. Not becoming a catchphrase. Are we going? Are we going? Going, going, gone, gotta go? Got everything. Earth people first. So we can be like, where do I find the other fourth of my tribe. Yes, I've got my safety tags. I'm good. I'm good. Yes. All right, let's go. Respect. Respect the antlers. I like decorating my antlers. It's a traditional Ashari tradition. Well. We are in the central Cliffkeep Of Tal'Dorei. And of the central-- Of the Cliffkeep Mountains. Yeah! (all laugh) Yep It's always like 20 degrees warmer in the valley. I like Tary. Stop-- No, no? These are-- Grog! Everyone, wait for a second. I step forward a second. Is this Patisse? Do I know Dryden from before? All right. Right. Yeah, yeah. Kaitiaki, Dryden. How are you? Have you fared well here recently, in the past several months? Have you talked to Cerkonos or Korren at all? We have slayed the Chroma Conclave. All the dragons are dead. Yes. I was wondering if I could speak to Headmaster Patisse. I am intent on continuing my journey on to the Water Ashari tribe. And I need information from him. Is Patisse indisposed? I mean it would just be nice to, like, say hi. While I'm here at least. I'm like a New Yorker on a subway. I'm just like, whatever. Used to this. Oh, it's built-- We've got infrastructure built for that sort of thing. It's fine, they're used to it here. Rockcaller. Rockcaller. Oh Jerry! How you been? How's the kids? Jerry! JERRY! I stand more in attention, more formal. Good to see you, Patisse, it's been quite some time. I just came to check in after the recent events in the world, make sure everyone was okay. That's correct. We've also slain his right-hand man, Raishan, who seemed to be the mastermind of the entire orchestration. Thank you. I couldn't have done it without your help and training, so I appreciate that. Well, I'm intent on continuing on with my Aramente now that there's relative peace in the world. The Vesrah people are quite insular, of course. I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how to get there and any advice in general on dealing with them? Right. Who's their headmaster there now? Do you know? Uvenda. Uvenda, the heart of the tides. What can I expect of this Uvenda? Uvenda. That's very vague of you, Patisse. No, you've got a point. Do you recommend by ship or would flight be more appropriate? All right. Any other words of encouragement? Oh, sorry, I probably should've introduced-- by the way, this is my band I've been traveling with, Vox Machina. And Tary. Tary Darrington. He's new. Of course. Yeah. That would be awesome. Yeah. Are there any other landmarks or ways of navigation to find them? They're an island in the middle of the Ozmit sea. (quietly) Awesome. Yes. We were going to look into trying to do that. Well, is there anything you need from me, Patisse, before we head on? Don't worry, we have many places we'd prefer to keep this way. Thank you for your belief in me. Kaitiaki, Patisse. (quietly) Good job. What did you say? Yeah, we can. I'm good. After this we'll probably have-- No, I'm good. I mean-- And then I'll be resting. Are we gonna do the airship, or-- no, I guess we left the airship in Whitestone. Or did we leave it in Emon? Hopefully, it's-- you know, let's see if it's still intact. That's true. You guys wanna go on a boat? Wait, does this mean-- Does this mean we can get yacht gear if we go on a boat-- or pirate gear? Pirate gear! You mean like Keds? You're talking about Keds? Boat shoes. (laughs) I have a kit for that. (laughs) Well, that's fun. I do the touristy thing to 'em again on the way out, like I do. (stammers) Our keep. Greyskull Keep. Garden. Tree. Sorry. That just took a while to find in my brain. (stammers) It's been a long few weeks. Only the best, only the best. Yeah. Cap Damon. Oh yeah, and it trickles down. Pike's here, right? She's in the city. 'Cause I imagine she would have good recommendations on good crews-- -- and boats. So, let's try and find Pike. Would Pike know if there's a good crew? Let's save ten minutes on finding Pike. Would Pike know if there's a good crew? Okay. To the docks! Ter the dercks! I'm not good at investigating. Who's good at investigating? Dockmaster Oban? Abban. A-B-B-A-N. Oh, man. Grog, that's-- that's not like free peanuts at the tavern. The profile of that. You look like a pirate! Where do you buy your clothes? Yep, that's right. Southwest. Have you stumbled upon Vesrah? All right. Not pirates. And you are definitely not-- --a pirate. Nope. You just look really cool. Oh, we don't need weapons. We're weapons! We're the most deadly thing in this land. Often enough? Drensala Vis. Did she just say crazy water people? I don't think we need anything. Do we need anything? I will come stacked with some water-breathing stuff. I think we can do it to eight people for like an hour or something like that? That'll definitely help. It's gonna be like a seven-hour trip-- or a seven-day trip. Adella. Oh, been on the sea a little long. Is your crew ready to go? Or would it be better to set sail in the morning? Okay. Moana! It just slowly sinks. Ocean voyage! We're going on a cruise, you guys! Now we learn how shitty cruises are. Well, and Pike. Well, Pike's not here-- That was so good.
