That was magic! It's very formal. Oh my goodness gracious. That's fair. Walked into that one. Yeah. You're an asshole. What were you going to say? Four to the right? (singing) Regular gnolls! (singing) Visual aid, visual aid. I can't see shit. Wait, are things happening? We can't see! Do you have your lights? 20. Nines and gnolls. That's our group name, you guys. I did! It was nowhere it should have been. Do you want a dice tray, Khary? We have an extra one down here. Look at that. It's a christening roll! Six or eight years old? I'm going to turn to Caleb and be like Can you do the thing? The lights? I'm going to wait until he casts Dancing Lights. Okay. Sure. I will stumble forward. I will head towards Molly because I'm going to follow his fluorescent purple coat. Molly! Molly! Where are they? I-- Because I moved and I'm not near anything. So I'll take the Dodge action. They're like market lights so it's pretty. Yeah. (high-pitched) Ooh! I'm in love. What? Oh! I think it's 2d8? Thank god it wasn't me this time. Okay, seeing the situation that Nott is in, I'm going to immediately run over and attack that hyena. I'm just going to run up and go, "Yeah, get!" Go kick and just kick it real hard. Git! I use my staff as a little bit like a jumping leverage point to give me a little bit of momentum and-- Yeah. What do I do? I roll 1d8 and then double it. That sucks, but that's six plus four, so ten. Can I do a bonus action to use my med kit on the kid? My healer's kit? I'll just move over to the kid and hold the wound. Yeah. Oh my god! He's trying to find a positive. Hey, you're a badass, what's your deal? Holy shit, this guy's good. Is there anyone else that you were with that's no longer with us in there? You didn't get taken from Alfield? How far was that tunnel to the surface? We cleared out this side. How long is it going to take to hike back the way we came? Let's do it. Oh my God. I crack boxes like fucking Zelda. Quiet, sorry. He's nearsighted. But you have advantage. Because he's assisting you. Let's go. Yeah. I'm so about it. He's so cool. 25. Shh! (laughter) Do they like each other? Oh, that's right. I reached into the ball bearings that I have left since I have about half. I take one and go-- (ball bearing bouncing) Ah, shit! He's stupid! Nott, do you want to? Did you roll the same thing? Oh, shit. Come back. 15 is the magic number. I was hoping so. I would get my ki point back. Jesus, shitty rolls. They're bats, just baseball bats with arms. (whispering) How many? It's like a motion simulator ride. Whoa! It's true. No, I don't know. Or our bed's not on braziers, no. LAURA and (whispering) Okay. Do it. Are we doing this? Do we get a surprise round? Or an earthquake. We're in a shaft! Things shake a lot. It's got a little moss on it from the cave? It wasn't cool when Arnold said it. I'll take the front. Linemen. Yeah. I knew what that meant. Oh. Tackle. I'm probably a guard. Fuck yeah. Son of a fuck! Eight. What's zip-- seven? No, I am. I rolled a nine. Sounds great. Yeah. Miss. Okay. Is it dark in here? Can I run up to the guy that just came up to Jester and wait until that light comes up from Caleb? Hold the attack? When I hold my action, can I also hold my bonus action with that? Can I use my bonus action to spend a ki point and do patient defense? Let's do that. I can still attack when it comes, right? Okay. Thank you. As soon as it comes around me, I'm going to use the staff with the light as it comes and crack it down over top of his head. Natural 20! I rolled an eight on my die! (sings) Max all the way around. That's 16 plus four! I'm not going to touch you right now. I'm sick. There we go. I'll hit the elbow. 20! Can I have the light following behind me as I run up? Fuck yeah. I hug the wall, let Fjord do his thing. (whisper) Shakäste. A rakshasa. Yeah. I turn to Shakäste and I say Are you a motivational speaker or something? He totally did. Good job! Yep. Miss, miss. See if I can catch another arrow. I'm going to do my Deflect Missile. I'm going to try and do like a frisbee catch in the air. It's a d10, right, d10? What was it, six damage? Five plus my seven, so yes. (stuttering) We're so cool right now! Yeah! All right. I'm going to vault past everybody. Well, never mind they all moved. I'm going to run up right into fray. Right in between the orange guy and the gray guy. Hit, and then I'll probably do my Flurry of Blows. I'm going to run up, I'm going to go for a rib shot with the bo. It's not a good roll. It's not great. 12. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah, wonder if that's a good idea. Maybe I should-- I'm going to Patient Defense this again. Do I have a bonus attack? That didn't go as well as I thought. That's true. Come on, Caleb! (cheering) Guys, I think Shakäste makes us better people. He makes us better. But we couldn't see that! (groaning) Well. I'm suddenly having regrets. 17. Totally probably wouldn't have even have run up. It'll be great. Yeah! In more level I get Feather Fall. That would've been nice. Thank you! Versus my strength, right? I'll take the acrobatics. Are you looking for patient defense shit? Oh, it doesn't? You did this! If I die it's on your head! Oh my god. Pick the dice that I use. I don't want to die. (yelling) Ugh! Goddamn it! That happened before! Make a what? Saving throw? (Panicked breathing) I'm good at this. I had Patient Defense, but-- I do? I have to roll at least a 12. That's an 11. Please be better. (fading scream) Busting fingernails. (wheezing) It knocks the air out of me, so going to be sick, I guess. Hit real good. (normally) 11 points? Oh, right. Hang on. (wheezing) I'm good. I'm okay. Oh because your Hex thing? That's awesome. (groaning) Fuck, that's half of my damn movement? Is it small enough to where I can do the wedge myself-- Is leap from side to side also athletics? Yeah, that one. Let's do that one. Monkish? Okay. 19. 18. Sorry. Yes. Did you guys know there's a hole? Now I climbed out of the hole to two gnolls. Hole to gnoll? Cool. I did! It took everything. Oh, yes! Fuck you! Okay, okay, okay. One! Plus four, so five damage. (cheering) Oh shit. Oh no. Is there still an ear left? What, really? Oh wait, this is to all-- wait. Oh. It was probably addressed to me because of Geek & Sundry. But this is to all of us. "To the cast of Critical Role, while--" Hang on, let me make sure. It's mine. Yeah. It is a gift for me. It's so great. They came fully stocked. Look at that. Look at how jealous Laura is. Look at that. It fuels me. I love it. Yeah, I'll take it. You have a height that's very identifiable. It's a very recognizable level you're on. Yeah, but what happens if they get sacrificed? I think that's smart. If we can get the baby, I bet it would fetch a high price. All right. I'll go up front with Fjord. Well, I'm dexy. But I'm not strong. But I'm dextrous. It depends on what we're talking about. Are we doing anything with strength checks? Oh! Dragging people away? Is that what we're talking about? The rest of us can be on distraction duty, yeah? Until we go. Nott? Sure. You can have a few. I hand him a handful. Did you just want that because it's shiny? Oh, Nott. (laughter) 19. We suck. Waiting to beat face. Should we creep forward a little? What should we do? I guess Fjord and I will take a good ten feet or so up. Will you put Fjord towards me? We'll just wait for Nott. Go Nott go. I'm a nine. Sorry. Do it girl! Oh, that's right! So. Sick. Okay, well it took off flying, so that sucks. I feel kind of like Grog. what can I do with that? Yeah, that's lame. I don't know what to do. I'll move forward and hold my action for light. Oh, where's the priest? But I can't see the priest, it's dark in here. I'm going to move behind Jester, and I'll just dodge as my action, there's not a lot I can do. Save yourself! Oh my god, are you going for it? Nott the Brave! (moans) Okay. How far away is Nott from me? Okay. I'm going to yell at Nott, I'm going to be like Nott, the fuck?! Then I'm going to take off in a full sprint towards Nott. I'm going to go the fuck?! I grab you again, and I scoop up Nott, and like a football drill, I dart, and then I'm going to dart all the way back with Nott. Carrying Nott like a football. Okay. I want to use my Step of the Wind. Ki point. Ah, damn it! I was hoping it would be on me! The fuck?! I still run. I don't have a bonus or anything, right? That was everything? Ooh! She's next to me, right? I'm next to two unconscious people going (screaming). Yeah, a weakling. Hindsight advantage. There are advantages to both! Okay, we could unload and then run! If you hit him, he gets to make a save? We should go. Do you want me to put you down? What do we do? Are we running or are we fighting? Okay, I'm going to, because I can, fuck the priest. Okay. Big ol' two-handed staff swing. That's not bad. 16! Nine points of damage. Ugh! Okay, in response to that, I'm going to be like Don't patronize me! Then I'm going to fucking Flurry of Blows. Elbow strike him to an uppercut. First attack. Yeah, that hits, with a 12? Natural 12. And then, not so good. 12 again. Total. Six plus four. Another ten points of damage. Hang on, I messed up that. Three plus four. I messed up. Seven damage. I'm sorry. I was adding the wrong modifier. I was looking at the wrong guy. Yes! No! I can still move? Right? I'm going to now move past Fjord and start heading away. I'll stay-- that's good. Aw, baby. Put. That. Shit. On. Your. Wall. Describe it! I was just going to say, I'm going to do a quick scan. See if there's anything of interest. Copy. Natural 19. 22. I'll definitely take the adornments from the priest. Can I see? If I can see in the dark. I need night vision goggles! Was it for the manticore? Are the runes recognizable in any way? Hey, you all right? I grab Caleb, wrap an arm around him, and try to walk him out. Cowardly gnolls, cowardly gnolls. Oh shit. We don't get to say goodbye. He's so cool. Have you ever played before? You're so good. What's it mean? We're heroes.
