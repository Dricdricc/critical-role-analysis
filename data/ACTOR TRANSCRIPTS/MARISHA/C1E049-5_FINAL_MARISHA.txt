Hi, guys! I'm Snizzler, the mad bombing alchemist! Yes! Episode two of Hector! Which is episode six of Signal Boost! Watch it. It's very funny. Check it out, it's very funny. Hector's funny. That's amazing I was going to make a joke about that, and then it was the real thing, so-- Like, there's a bag of stuff. I don't even know what it is. It's exciting. So excited, it gave him indigestion. Oh my god, I'm so excited. Also, I'm using Liam's dice box because he's not here, and he can't stop it. (laughter) I'm going to rub my butt on it. Usually this means she's been drinking, I just want to point that out. Let's go! What?! I agree, I agree. Yeah! Only with a good meal and a drink! You got it? Yeah! Whoever said you were the smartest? That is pretty good logic. I agree with that. I agree with that, yeah. You don't want to tarnish your beautiful, shining reputation. Exactly, exactly! Right, so, naturally, we're better to lead. Am I right, Grizz? Grizz'n'Snizz! Grizz or Snizz? Well, he's leading. Oh boy, you're so smart. Look, Grizz, look. I'm really good at building things, so naturally I know how to survive better. I did, I did, in the Boy Scouts. We did. Good times. Can I try? All right. Jeez, all right, come on. Let me see. All right, thank you. We got it from an old badger. I rolled a natural one. Are they going to make it out of the brush? Look, it's just about finding the flow. Oh, jeez, there's poison oak everywhere! I think we're further than we started. Okay. I agree! I agree! You kill it every time, Grizz! You always did read the most. Holy shit! Did you see that, dude?! That was rad, bro! Oh yeah! I love family outings. That was fun, like a game. Especially if they're human cities. You know we don't use no dirty human-made contraptions. No, no, no, look the Snizz can do a lot of things. The Snizz does not swim. Not very confident in my swimming abilities. Ten. How are we going to cross? I'm really nervous about water. I like burning things. Build a rough raft. I roll as well. Oh, survival. Ten. But he rolled pretty good. 32. Be garden gnomes you guys, garden gnomes! Haha, garden gnome act gets 'em every time! Heh, heh, heh. I agree. Boom-boom! Heh. Oh, I'm so bad at this! I'm really not the best swimmer, you guys. Oh boy, this is so bad! Four. I have a fear of swimming. (yelling) (hyperventilates quietly) I'm so afraid. Negative one. I have a negative four swim, I just want to point that out. (cries) Snizzler vomits. As soon as he hits land (vomit noises). 19. Oh, dude, and we got so blazed. That was so good, man. Yeah, yeah, I agree. Yeah! This is the best, when it's crispy on the outside but gooey on the inside. Snizzler takes a firecracker that he has and secretly lights it and throws it behind him real fast without telling anybody. Yeah, why are we here? And we stay under trees when there's lightning. That's what you're thinking of. Pass me a rib. We didn't think about having to crawl back out. "Probably magic." Oh, you found a waterbed! Aw, how cool, man! Oh! Gelatinous cube! 15. 15. See! If you will it, it will happen. Haven't you heard of the story of the little boy with the magical paintbrush? He named it himself. Cool. Hey Piglet! How's the jello monster? The novocaine cube. Does he have any limbs or anything that are sticking out still that are accessible? Where am I on the map? Oh, that's good to know. Okay. Snizzler runs up, takes out a pipe bomb. (clicking noise) Can I shove the pipe bomb in the jello? Is it going to start sucking me in when I do that? I want to find the hole Piglet made and aim for that. And (grunts). Explosive bomb. And I look at Grizz and I go-- And I take a few steps back. Not into the hole. Hang on one second, man. Sorry, Grizz. 18. Aw, it went into my soy sauce but I'm going to take it because it was a six. (laughter) So 15 points of damage. I was going to say, I do want to do an explosive bomb, so direct hits catch fire, dealing an additional 1d6 fire damage every round. Oh man. Is that adding your reflex? Adding your reflex. Fuck you, Seal. Fuck you. No! Four. Burn! Fire! Fury of bros? (laughs) PHIL  Fury of bros, (screams) yeah dude! Yeah, I help as well. Oh, Grizz! I take a little goo out of his ear and I-- Ah, yeah, it's got a little kick there, yeah, you're right. Do we get any healing surges or anything like that? Yeah, I like that. Is Mezek getting in a fight with a wall again? This is one of those cel-lar. Cel-lar? Eat up, maybe? You're very curvy. And you've got a little junk in the trunk, looks good. Ah, sure, yeah. Your mom, man. Don't let me forget, I want to try and find some wine bottles for molotov cocktails, don't let me forget. Oh, wait, I want to make sure I find some wine bottles, maybe I can make some molotov cocktails real quick. Maybe. Looks expensive. Yeah. Like a dog rolling in his vomit. I like that. Yeah. For the blue poop. Let's find the blue poop. Onward. Maybe there's more cellars like this too. Good one. We're all rolling terrible tonight. I'll join. We'll make goblin-- Goblin chain. We're going to goblin chain this. Everyone loop together. No I'm goblin chaining this with them. Straight dexterity? 20, total. Damn, guys. We're badasses, just like we practiced. Good work. I volunteer. I think I have a plan. It only works for me though, but fuck you guys. Wait, first I take out a bottle and I drink it. And I shrink. I take my Reduce Person vial. Okay. Are you ready to throw me? Let's try this. What are you guys laughing at? What? Don't-- (garble) Stop it. Mom! Mom! 20! You guys, it's beautiful from up here. Hang on, wait. She rolled the Golden Snitch. Let me roll my golden. Not, not-- It never rolls well. Wait, this is just a dexterity? 12. What? Am I falling now? I guess it's song time. As I'm still soaring, in my tiny voice, I say (sing) Snizzler, zazzlers, sizzler, zaz. Eyebrows this goblin once had. My bombs go boom, they never miss. Hi Homeland Security, because now I'm on the watchlist. Yes. Yes, it is. I'll use this one. Ten. I hate water. I'm fucking terrible at swimming. Oh god. Okay. Well, I rolled a 14 and I have a minus four, to my swim. So ten. Seriously, you guys. Oh, that's better. 13. Come on. Can I see if I can find purchase on a little rock? Off to the side, I can hold onto. Come on! Come on. The rest of us are total degenerates. I love that song. Oh we're all doing this? Oh my god. Three? MATT; (laughing) What do you have, Grizznak? I take the poop and I start making a ball out of it and I light it to see how flammable it is. Definitely lots of alcohol, lots of drugs, yeah. I start packaging up some of the poop. Maybe if we get on each others' shoulders with a coat, we'll look like peoples! I look around. Do I see anything that looks like a children's clothing store? Maybe two of us can be a child and three of us can be an adult. Okay, yeah, no, you're right, Grizz. I'll stand guard and watch outside the window. What's going on? (frantic yelling) Before the cloud gets too thick, I go-- and run. Okay, let's do it! I don't like talking to people. I've been doing a lot of crunches, so I feel pretty good about being the core. What did you eat?! Yes, like Men in Black. Whoa! He's got a boom-boom rock. Fire! Someone's making really big boom-booms. I want to meet that person! Here, I can help clear this area out, too. I light another little firecracker and throw it down next to us to scare the crowd. Damn adventuring parties. 22. Yeah, you can flee. I'm not above it. They got lots of hair. We've got really big ears, though. 22. 22. (sheep bleating) First, I'm going to take a pipe bomb and throw it right at that one. I move up one square and then I hit him. 18! Touch attack. Everyone in a ten foot radius must make a reflex save. 14. Plus the main dude takes 13 damage. Can I use the rest of my movement to also run backwards? Run towards these things. That's fine. What? I don't understand you! Speak English! Foul play, man, foul play. Thought you were trying to tell me something. 17. Five. Yeah, go Grizz! Song time! Every time we've used our songs to reroll it's gotten worse! Big money, no whammies! Oh, shit! That was nuts! You have the rock, don't you? Whereabouts are you, Browntooth? Seeing where Browntooth is, I'm like, he's got the right idea. I'm going to move up like to here. Over one. Yeah. Throw another bomb at the cleric. Yeah. Bombs! Boom boom! That's not good at all! Oh, that's right, it does technically scatter. I'm going to let it scatter. I rolled a four plus eight, so 12. Oh, perfect! Fire! I continue my movement towards Browntooth. Oh, shit. Eh? What? Natural one. Again. People hate goblin songs. Just a straight will save? Three. Roll that hammer damage! Oh, shit! About the time the adventuring party starts rethinking their career choices. Natural 20! Come on, come on! Big money, no whammies! Yeah, Browntooth! Man, left side of the table today. Table Right is just sucking it up. We don't need to be here, really. Even though she's dead, it doesn't just break? Good work, Team Left! Yeah! Good work, Grizz, even though you're still unconscious. Where is he at? I see the wizard and I take a step back onto the platform right behind me. I take out my goblin bomb launcher. Yeah! I go, all right! I arc it upwards and I go boof and aim for the wizard. 18! Six plus three plus two, so 11 damage. Burn, wizard, burn! Another point of damage. Yeah! Whoa! That was rad! Rad! Hang on. Snizzler walks over and pours a Cure Light Wounds down. Just one. Dude, you were unconscious. It was so cool. Yeah, you did, man! It was awesome. Yeah! All right, let's go. As they go down into the sewer, I'm going to be the last one and I'm going to take my last bomb launcher. I'm going to aim for the church. In the sushi again! Ooh! 21. Grizz. This is my art. Thank you, man. It's beautiful. And some poo and some bottles for molotov cocktails. Slip'n'Slide! The ones that are always in the books? We killed Pathfinder! These people, yeah! Somewhere, there's a whole new set of gamers being like, "This RPG shit's bullshit. I "died at level two. It was stupid. I'm over it." So they get these cool little goblin things, and this cool stuffies? I debated. I was like, I'm chaotic evil. Technically, I wouldn't. Well, you're my homie, it's fine. We got a winner? And a one-year subscription to Syrinscape? That was some good music. I really liked the drum one. The tribal one. The screaming people were great. Did you do it, though? Yeah, we don't do a lot when we have the opportunity. You did so much early on. We all sang our song once. That's fantastic. What happens if you run out of kicking ass? Like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the RPG?
