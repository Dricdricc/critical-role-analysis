Imgur. We're really doing this? I can't believe you guys are doing this for him. Max! Yeah! Bishaft? It's made of fucking cookies. You have evasion. What? Just get them all out. Yeah? We were saying our daily prayers. Yeah, it's called, "Get the fuck out of our business." Sorry. I've been on a boat for a very long time. You're sure we shouldn't let Fjord know? Or we should just handle it? Do we kill them? No! (quick footsteps) Before I go down I go Fjord. Sorry for being a dick. Then just go. It went downstairs? Let's go. (whispering) Okay. What is it? (whispering) Oh, that's cool. Natural 20! Thanks for that blessing! I put on my night-vision goggles. (whispering) What? You can be scary! I look at Nott. (whispering) You. Me. Flank. Let's go. (quick footsteps) Okay, okay! Okay. Who the fuck are you, though? Seriously? Okay, I feel like we're-- We're letting the cuteness distract us! Why were you hiding? Sorry, sorry. Why did you feel the need to hide? What did you do? I can relate. I'm so nice. Okay, I got-- ah, it's happening. Hey, Twiggy. Now that you've looked at the fragment, you're bonded to us, which means if you betray us, we'll know how to find you. Is there-- Yes. Marius, please god, save me. Marius, let's go. That's what we found. This is Twiggy. I call Caduceus over. Caduceus? We found a Twiggy. She was hiding. She stole this. This ship? Where are you from? You're a gnome, right? Don't gnomes live for a pretty long time? So you could actually be fairly old-- -- and look pretty young. You don't know. You don't know how old you are. Fascinating. I don't think she's as young as she seems. He has an octopus. Interesting. Was this in Port Damali? Yeah, it was super freaky, actually. I'm a little confused at your implication as well. As Fjord gets the boat going, I follow after Fjord. Do you need help getting the boat-- ship sailing? Ship moving? Whatever. Am I the only one that's not beguiled by her charms? Twiggy? Me neither. Anything that cute-- Have you ever noticed that pomeranians are the nastiest dogs you've ever met? They're poofy. They're super adorable. They'll eat your face. That's a solid option. Like a Plan D. She definitely has some magic capabilities. She cast this illusion that made her hand look like it was extending. I think it was supposed to be cute, but you know that uncanny valley? It was a little weird. It's unsettling. Hey, I have another question. Since you're captain now, right? You're captain? Will you train me to be your first mate? Really? Okay. Yeah, okay. Deal. Sorry again for being a dick. I think I've been a little bit on edge with the boat. It's really just a knee-jerk, it would've happened if it was anybody. You could've been a scarecrow, and I would've been like, "Fuck off, bro!" Okay, let's go. It actually works pretty easily! You just add a line, and then you paint over that. I agree with Caduceus. These are registered deadly weapons. Actually, going off of that, because I meant to do this last episode, did Avantika have anything fabulous in her wardrobe? We were opening it up. I take one of her darker overcoats. Jester gives us a fashion show. Are you still learning tattoos from Orly? And his first mate. So it creates things. It creates money, it creates gems, and it creates holes to-- Welcome to The Mighty Nein. Do it again. Nott! Do you want to go in a hole? It's still a foot? Well, he says it lasts a minute. When we've timed it! All right, I'll do it. Yeah! Caduceus, grab my feet, just in case. Just grab my feet. Drop me further! Goggles, yeah! I grab a few! Pull me back! What is my face? It was super dark. I hit a barrier. It felt like it was a barrier of stuff. Oh, shit. Do we know what language that name hails from? It was cloak and stuff. It was cold in there. I don't know. He's saying that the staff heats his hands, and there was a cloak. Maybe wherever this haversack was from-- It feels like someone was raptured, and we're stealing their stuff. That's what it feels like. I go to Fjord. You've told us about the Halas thing? Is this perhaps something to do with Sir Cadigan and Port Damali stuff? Do you know a Cadigan? Would I recognize the name Hadigas? No, Halas. To see if this is his old stash. That's absolutely horrifying. Ten. I mean, you've mentioned Sir Cadigan being a big old meanie several times. What did he do? Did you witness something? It was Hala? TRAVIS and Like one of those bomb shelter walls. What if you unleash the wailing creature and we have to deal with it? It's survival. I'll take the gum. I'm not proud. This is some Bones shit. I don't-- I think-- We'll talk later. That's what I was going to ask. It's a forceful darkness and looking at Fjord get nauseous, does this remind me of any ghostly presence that I experienced before? Oh my god. 11. I'll be after Fjord. Is there any scripture or writing on the--? Yeah, to like enter this door. Natural 20. Is there any image in the stained glass? I think we're about to enter into someone's study. 34. Oh shit. Don't fuck me, Gil. 15. That's actually, yes. And where is that amongst the planes, the little ruby amongst the sea? Is it in between two certain certain planes? Oh shit. What?! Are you serious?! Why does this keep happening to you? I was actually technically watching from downstairs. Shut up! Marishative. 11. "Beau is going at the same time as the cabinet." Man, some days you lose, some days you beat a cabinet. (laughter) I look over and I go They're fine, and I go upstairs with Jester. Nope. I don't give a fuck right now about that cabinet. Oh, it moves? Now I care a little. While she was doing that, I was like I feel like I saw him look over here somewhere. So over here, yeah. He's gone. Yeah, he was looking in this area. He was like, "Ah", and then I feel like I saw his head go over here. But then the bookshelf was in the way, so I couldn't see what he was reaching for. Natural 19. Thank you, Gil. 24. Feels like something recent. I think I know what Fjord did. Hey, Caduceus. Or Caleb. Can either one of you put light behind this stained glass? Backlight it? Caleb? Yeah, I was going to say. I have a feeling that's where Fjord is. I think he touched this thing, which... yeah. I mean-- It's maybe the way out. Or somewhere else. I want one of those. While they all do that, I go I'm going to see how Fjord's doing-- (thud)-- and hit the ruby. Oh. Sorry. Oh shit! My actions affect other people. Fuck. Oh no. You're good! 12! This feels like a lot. 15. I turn to Jester and I go Fjord just fucking vanished again! And I go I don't know how this works! I take out the red elemental gem that I've had for a very long time, and I... use it. I was going to say I smash it, but then I felt that might be deeply irresponsible because then it could just smash. Badminton. I go Fuck him up! God, well, I think it's one of those things where, if something bad happens, it turns on us. Yeah, if I lose concentration, but I don't know-- Okay. What do I-- that's not good. Nope. I did when I was a druid. I can also use D&D Beyond. Search. What's his initiative? Uh-huh. What's his dex? Nine. Nein. So I stand. I'm going to back up towards this alcove a little bit, right behind me. Yep. I'm going to use my bonus action to take Patient Defense. Okay, I would like for it to get up to it and to do melee attacks. Hang on, sorry. I'm going to do the multiattack, so two touch attacks. First one, that's okay. Wait, what am I? Sorry. 18 is the dragon's AC. And then one more attack. Oh, yes, and it does 2d6 plus three, which is five plus three. Eight, and it does catch on fire. Then it's going to do another attack, which, I think it fails. It definitely fails. No, it's going to stay there and be like What's up, I'm a fire elemental. It takes d10 damage. Eight! Okay. I have Patient Defense. Okay. Dexterity saving throw. Okay. 21. Can I use evasion, or does that matter right now? I take no damage. Evasion, yeah. Not good. You said 57 damage? 52 damage? Wow. This is bad. I have evasion. That's the only reason I'm okay. Okay. Yes, it hits. I rolled a 17. No, a natural 17 plus six. Ten damage. Hey, speak for yourself! Where are all my friends? Bullshit! I saw Fjord dart that way, and I heard screams coming from that way-- Manly screams! I'm going to run this way past Jester and check out this hall. My speed is 45. What do I see? In towards the platform or the casket? What's with the casket situation? I don't know. Into the platform. I'm going to touch it! I'm going to touch the crystal. Did anything happen? I go (shouting) Work!-- into it. (shouting) Energy! No? Okay. I have a bonus action? I'm going to use my bonus action to cast another ki point to do Step of the Wind and dash back towards the pedestal. To the pedestal. That's-- yeah. As I dart by Jester, I go fucking crystals! And that's it. Oh, but it was so good! He multi-attacks. No. It can't. He sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius. Can he move forward a little bit? Yeah, can he hold his attack in case he's in range? Yeah. I shouldn't have readied an attack! First one, yep, it hits with a 20, which is nine points of damage. Sorry! And he gets another attack. Oh no, wait, he can only hold one attack. He hits with this one, as well. I'm sorry! 11. I mean, I shouldn't have fucking held his attack. SAM, LAURA, and You've got him in range. Six. I can use evasion again, right? If I succeed. Fuck yes! I rolled a 25 total. Twiggy. It was cold? That was awesome. Fire and ice. Yeah, we got it in range. I'm sorry I killed him. So I get an attack, and Sentinel. No! A four. Natural 20. Five, ten, plus another 13 damage. Right? It's dice times two. It's going after Jester? Is it its turn? It takes fire damage, too. Another six. Oh wait, no, it's the elemental's turn, right? The elemental goes after the dragon? That's right. Yeah. Do the football body slam. Okay, I'm going to run over here to the altar-casket situation and I'm going to quickly check it out. What do I do? Do I still have an action? Can I try and replicate on this sphere the movements I watched Twiggy do to get us here? No! Fucking-- Hope it's home. There's that whole thing about them which I kind of knew going into this. Sorry. Bye! Oh, sorry. It's half-dead. Sorry. Meanwhile... Eyy! Fuck up that dragon! Kill him! Oh my god, why is he doing that? Blink! Kill him! Kill him. With your bodies. Who saw me bamf out by touching the thing? Jes for sure did. And Fjord? Okay. They didn't run. Ah! You had to have seen Caduceus. He said, "We're running; it's bad," and then jumped into a sphere. That's some children's cartoon-level obvious. Yas, queen! I'm a dummy! Get out, Jes. You've got to run. Just run. Run and pray? She can go now if he uses his reaction. Jester's next, right? Is that a one?! Mm-hmm, and 40 hp. Last man standing, Twiggy! How many hit points did you have? You would have been gone. To get the reaction, yeah. That was Nott, the Bravest. Aww, Jessie... What?! Are you serious? Sorry. Thanks, Twiggy. I'm sorry I found your cuteness alarming. Well, that was the weirdest seven days I didn't know I had. Jester, are you all right? You're a bad liar. Sure. Hey, Fjord? I feel like there's this trend of us feeling shitty after we come out of a fight. Hmm. That was a dragon. I don't even know what any of it meant. Well, I guess there's still time to figure it all out. It feels like that gold was stealing from the dragon, just slowly but surely. Yeah. Anyway... But he's dead now, so what does it matter? We could just slowly drain it. It's like a never-ending piggy bank. That's true. I guess I'm going to stay up. I don't feel like sleeping just yet. Copy that, captain. How are you? Oddly, I feel okay too. Is that wrong of me? I feel like everyone else feels so terribly. I think I oddly feel the most comfortable when things are a fraction away from going terribly wrong. So did you.
