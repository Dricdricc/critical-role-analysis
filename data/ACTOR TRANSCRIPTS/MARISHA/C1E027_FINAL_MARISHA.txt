I bet if you go back and look at the Q and A session we had, someone asked our dream game crew-- I made this just for you. Happy birthday, Orion's mom. Momlan. As Orion says, release the Critters. No, we have him. It's balance. (ricochet sound) How far can I get? Nothing's in visual sight? Can I dash and then make a bonus action? I'll just wait. Let me just scootch over so I can be behind Vex. Well, to be fair, we talked. We didn't have a battle. No. That's a d10. These are d8s. You do! Dope. We need him alive. Come on, Trinket! Okay, I'm going to-- seeing the direction that everyone's pointing, going to walk up and reach around Vex and I'm going to cast Faerie Fire right-- oh god, wrong direction. Right in the fucking eye. (laughter) Crit fail. It's a 20-foot cube, so I want to cast it right in the cell. Against my spell's DC? 18. You have advantage now. And I'm going to take my bonus action to do Healing Word on the-- it's not Jarett that's unconscious, it's the cab driver. On the cab driver. Six plus my spell modifier. So ten? Is that right, is that how it works? Plus my spell level? Is that what it is with Healing Word? 1d4 plus my spellcasting ability modifier. Six, so 12. Can we do a check? 22? I mean, I can still go ahead and do the planar bindings to an elemental that maybe I should've done beforehand. It lasts 30 days. It's fine. You'll have him in between you and him. What time is it? It's fine. Nope. 17. I told you it worked! Sorry, I'm a little defensive right now. Continue. We were afraid of that. So why didn't you want to show that you were also cleansed? What was the point of holding up the charade? So are we in agreement that we have to clear Uriel's mind first? Is Percy here? Is Percy in the room? I go get Percy. Oh. I come around the corner, and I see Percy. Hey! I was looking for you. You want to come and actually join the conversation for once, instead of sitting outside the door and just listening to them? Because I really feel like this is going to be your time to input and maybe really help? Okay. Percy and I walk in. Wait, what's the name of the town? Not Whitestone. Oh, I thought he was saying he was going to go to their hometown. He's not going to Whitestone. He's going to go to Wildemount, which is on another continent. If we go to another continent, it doesn't matter if we're fleeing or not. It's going to look like fleeing. Do you genuinely think they're going to let us go with permission? We're not on their good side. You know them better than anyone. Can I do an insight check on him? See if he knows more than what he's saying? 19. Is that a nine? I agree. While we're not serving Uriel, that's not our purpose, I also don't want to leave an enemy of the state. That's not good for me, for what I want. And what, go with Jarett? Not Jarett, Asum. Then why don't we save his mind before we go? You've got to give context to those things, man. I go up to his arm, and I Druidcraft a wooden armband. Make it look cool. And put that on him. No, onto Asum. Now I can scry through that. That way I can at least check in on you every once in a while. If you're okay with that? 21. He did say it was an inspired idea. His words. Don't worry. I won't abuse it, I promise. Could you potentially help us with sneaking in the castle? What if we talk to Allura? Percy is being very quiet about this. Can I see if he looks like shaken or fucked up at all? Wait, we're leaving to Whitestone? TRAVIS and What time is it? What we were talking about? Can I help him with that? Can I assist him? Go Percy, go! That's pretty good. You still have inspiration from Scanlan? We were talking about making it collapsible. I'll pitch in for that. How much do you have? You have less than 100 gold? I'll pay for it in full. Why? It's fine. This is what we were talking about. The whole thing's wasted? Can we try and repair the crack? And how many more days? How many more days do we have? There's nothing I can do to help him? My intellect? I've got plus three. Percy roll. Come on. Maybe a version of it that is not collapsible that we can at least mount? I thought we got a bit of an allowance. It's how much? Yeah, you have to have magic. Chainmail dickies. Sherri. The whole time? No, you said I couldn't assist him. I had no intelligence to assist him. That's what I was saying. I don't know if you can do holy water. I can do a Fog spell. Like, the best I could possibly do is maybe take one of these holy water things. Oh wait, I don't do that. #OrionAcaba. I need to do shit, too. I can't be everyone's bitch. I got to Gilmore's and I buy an alchemy set. This is made of things. And then I go home and I make a few Cure Wounds potions. Try it out, since I've learned and I've been studying and I've been doing my research. So maybe a few level two, level three Cure Wounds potions? Wait, they cost 500 to 600 and they cost 400 for me to make them? Oh, okay. Cheaper over time as I get better at it? That's funsies. Well, let me make-- What is that? A greater healing potion? Let me make one for right now. That's an 18. That's pretty good. Awesome. I had a Percy-roll! And he hates me for it. How long will it take me to make a Daylight scroll? Third. Then I make two greater healing potions. Actually, no, I want to experiment. I want to take one of those holy water bottles. And I want to see if I can enchant it with my Fog spell. To make it a holy water fog grenade. When you throw it, it'll go (shatters) with my fog spell. What if I enchant it with Daylight? Oh wait, it still won't-- I'm going to do it, anyway. I'm going to do the fog thing, because I said it. I'm going to commit. No, for the fog holy water thing. It's a holy smoke grenade. Sure. That'll be my two things I do. Natural 20. Who would like a very unstable item? I give it to Scanlan. Please be careful. Wait, I tell him. Scanlan, this is very delicate. Please be very gentle with this. That I trust. I trust that more. Fine. Good. Advantage! Dope. Grog? Do you think I should do the whole elemental guardian thing? All right. Give me that ruby. (ting) I catch it. Water elemental seems appropriate based on our knowledge, yeah? Water elemental. And Planar Binding. And I talk to him in my elemental speech, which I can do. And I say, look, we're going to be gone for 30 days. We have a visitor here. Make sure nothing or no one brings him any harm. (laughter) Wait, what? I'm sorry. For my time here, I serve? Are we riding there by horseback? Is that what we're doing? Well, we had one at our disposal when we were friends of the city. Yeah, let's not tell anybody that we're leaving. Do we need a carriage? We have a stable full of horses. So that would shave time? Let's head there and make camp. And maybe talk about a plan. Do it. How far across is the bridge? A hundred feet? Are we going by foot now? Here's my question. What looks shaky, the connection of the bridge or the actual, physical condition of the bridge itself? For bonus added safety in case this bridge gives way, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine and have it loop and wrap around the edge of the bridge. Further enforce it. At least that side will be fine. And then I'll go across. Concentration spells. Who's left? So what's our plan? What are we doing? 19. Are they flying off a cliff? I Grasping Vine him before he goes out of view. Off the side of the cliff. What?! 19. 25. Does it sounds like anything nature-based? Something I could possibly have talked to in the past? 25. Oh, fucking harpies. TALIESIN and (shushes) Everyone be quiet! MATT How long is the concentration on Pass Without a Trace? How long can you hold that concentration? Where are we against the mountain? Are we still on the mountain edge? So we have a mountain behind our backs? I turn around and I cast Move Earth, my 6th-level fucker. And I (boof) and I clear out a cave. Horses saved our lives, guys. I go ahead and Druidcraft a little campfire. Tiberius, you want to light a fire for us? Me and Tiberius made a fire. I also stay up with Percy. I talk to Percy for a second. Percy, while we're alone for a moment, there's something that's been bothering me, and I can't get it out of my head. I thought I'd talk to you about it because I feel-- we're friends, right? We're friends? Are we friends? Been through a lot, been together a while. Two years now? You know, you're a very brilliant person. I can't help but feel like I'm being watched right now. Never mind, forget I said anything. I can't help but feel like there's something else, there's something more to this that you're not telling us. And I didn't really think of anything until we were having that fight where Tiberius brutally murdered that old woman. Yeah, me too. But the one thing that I can't get out of my head was something that you said during that fight. And for a long time I was like, damn, Percy's got really cool one-liners and he's so smart, and I wish I could have cool one-liners. You and Grog have really cool one-liners. And then you said "your soul is now forfeit" to the person you shot that night. And I thought, wow! That was an interesting one-liner. Yeah! Yeah, you did. For some reason, I was the only one who noticed it, and I don't know if that's because I'm just reading into things, if that was just a really awesome, but scary and brutal thing to say in the moment, or if there's something deeper that you might be serving. What thing? Wait, what are you saying? You had knowledge? You didn't build that without inspiration? What do you mean? Can I see if he's lying to me? 17. Yeah, I'm wise as fuck! What? What did you say? I still really feel like we're being watched. Do you feel that? I don't know. It's really distracting. Yeah. Well, I love you. We're in this with you until this end. Let's sleep. We overslept! Okay, so wait. Percy, how much further out are we from Whitestone? 32. Ah, that's all right. 14. Let me think about it for a second. Do I know a creature that's blue and snakey? I don't know. Ooh, that's 24. The blue thing's weird. The blue thing is what's throwing me. But it didn't seem to give a shit? I can, I can cast Anti-Life Shell on us. Then we can haul ass really fast. Yeah, as long as you stay close to me. It moves with me. Okay! I cast Anti-Life Shell. Stay close!
