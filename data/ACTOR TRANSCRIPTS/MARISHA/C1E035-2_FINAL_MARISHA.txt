Are we sure this won't make anything bad happen if we throw a body into the acid pits? Okay. What about you? How do you feel? Yeah. Oh, the revolution. We should go stop the fighting. Right? We should probably let them know it's over. Well, I'm sure they don't know that the Briarwoods are dead. Okay. I cast Hold Person at 3rd level. Percy! Son of a fuck. My difficulty class? 18. (laughs) I always fail rolls against Percy! It sucks! We'll get you a new one, Percy. See? Doesn't it feel good? Oh, Percival, that hurts. Still holding him in place. You sure you want to let him go? You sure? Did you hear what he just said to you? You sure? I let it go. But you're still alive! I'm going to head straight for the front door and look in-- is there a balcony on top? Yeah, I was going to say. 20. Yes. It's true. Is it still cloudy? I'm going to go ahead and at third level, because that's all I got left, cast Skywrite again, and throw up the de Rolo crest once again in the sky. No! No one should be allowed in for right now, until we figure this out. We really need to rest. What time of day is it? Do we have a sense? Is the sun still up? Before we take a rest, I'm going to look at Percy, and I'm going to be like, I'll catch up with you guys. I think the people need to see the sun. And I'm going to go into my air elemental form, go up into the sky above Whitestone, and do my Whirlwind ability and start trying to just push all of the clouds out of the way to let the sun in. Have I cleared up enough of the sky at this point? I want to get to that. We searched a little bit. So beautiful. Block party! Define "Judgeface." Aw, it's a potluck. Make it good. Can Keyleth go over and check out the Sun Tree? Eskil? I reach up and I put my hand on it and I cast Commune With Nature. Do I gather anything? Essentially. Oh, what are my choices? The influence of other planes of existence sounds promising. That's good. Yeah, sure, okay. Oh, I get a choice? I didn't know I had a choice. I want to know if-- god, so many options. Is it going to be a good growing season this spring? Crops going to be good? It's going to be a good harvest moon? How's it feeling? Can I ask the tree how it's feeling, can I be like, "Hey tree. How are "you doing today?" You doing all right? How do you feel between all this, about all this? Hey, boo. Does it feel positive? Okay. Can I just say, good morning, old friend. I go, oh shit. And then I turn to Percy and I say, the tree talked to me. You just had a smoke monster you were talking to, is it that hard to believe? As I'm talking, good morning, Sun Tree. I jump and I yank away instinctually. I was just talking to the tree. It talked back. (giggling) Everyone is hiding. I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm really confused. Wait. I'd be lying if I said often at night when I go to sleep, your face isn't the last thing that crosses my mind. But with the weight of the world and the weight of the contact-embarrassment from our fellow party, currently, it's hard to focus on. (hesitantly) You said that when you were near death. We say a lot of things when we're near death. How do I know that's what you were truly feeling? Oh yeah, no, you said that out loud. Yeah, no, that wasn't in your head. Wait? Okay. I don't know what else to say right now. I'm really tired. Really tired. I think there's also a part of me that's just afraid. I stay by the tree.
