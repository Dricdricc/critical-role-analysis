It really looks like crying for 60 seconds. That's fair. Oh yeah! Sagas of Sundry announcement! Cast list went out! Who's in it? We are! Look again! Abigail Persimmon. I'm not coming tomorrow because I've already had mine. That's right! You did! We went on a shopping trip, and we had so much fun. Anyone who hasn't seen any of the first season-- I'm still a planetar. Do you still have Bigby's Hand up? I do a potato sack hold on Scanlan. Make sure he's all right. Here, can one of us fly over and get it? With Scanlan in hand, start diving down to go see if I can find them or have any sight of them at all. 150 feet. Like Superman and Lois Lane. Shut up, Scanlan! Are they dead? 18. They're splatted. Sure. They didn't goldfish it. I've got to move them, right? Is that what you're saying? Scanlan? You're fine, right? Handle yourself? Do you want to hold onto my back? Okay, 18. No, wait! Yeah, 18. I'm going to immediately burn two of my healing touches, and you get 6d8 plus three hit points back. 29 hit points to both of you immediately. Did you recognize me because of the antlers? That's why I keep them. They're very identifying. No, that was real and incredible, and you all showed up. Yeah-- wait, what? I drop Kash, but very lightly set down Zahra. Congratulations! Wait, you want to find his hand on the giant tower full of rubble? I look up and say Grog, do you need a hand? Are you all right? Damn it, the pun wasn't intended, Scanlan! (laughter) Do you need assistance getting down from hanging from a bar? In the middle of the air, to be very literal. I fly up. Don't leave the rod! I can raise dead. No. I might need some help. Where's Pike? She doesn't come back as a zombie, right? It's raising dead. It says three times a day. Yep. If I did it with Kash, would that-- I don't know how to respond to that. I don't even know if I have a full hour left on my form. That's the only problem. That's why I would need help, but-- I help Kash as much as I can. And I don't take my eyes off of Vax the whole time. We saved each other. That's kind of what Vox Machina's all about. Sounds like you're going to have an actual family soon. Start spreading the word yourself. You can help us out, right? I was going to say I think I still have a Skywrite. Yep. Oh my god! Vecna defeated. (laughs) I can write it out. Yeah. In the mirror. I guess the help was worth the fucking, but only a little bit. You know, you're not having-- Grog. We all think you're strong. You don't need to have an inferiority complex. Why are you so connected to the pissing thing? What's-her-name worshipped Bahamut. Was it Kima? Kima! Kima worships Bahamut. Is that going on all the time in your head? Okay. I grab onto Vax and don't let go. Yeah, this is awesome. Does he still have the blessing? Yeah. I can draw on you with the remaining remnants. That way you have it there, always. Okay. I try to draw the outline of the remaining glyph on his head. Okay. Straight dex? Don't fuck me, Gil! 14. Yeah, that right there. That's perfect. Get that tattooed. Definitely on the forehead. I'm not sure what we're talking about anymore. No, he got them. Wait, we're branded, and then I've got mine, and then he has his. Bullshit! My passive perception is 21. We were talking about you. I mean, we were talking about-- sorry, I'm still working on it. My wings are gone. Have we taken a short rest, at this point? My beast shape's back. Well, what do you want to fly in on? What do you want? I can't do that. I can do anything in the animal kingdom. He flew away. I'll scry on him. Oh, I haven't used any of my 5th-level spells! Yeah. I still have 3rd-level spells. Yep. I also have my 6th-level spells. I have Sunbeam learned, which is dope. Okay, I'm going to scry on him. He's used all of his legendary resistances? Is that what that was? Oh my god! He rolled a natural 19? I can do it again. Can I do it again? I do it again! No pants? You guys! He's shirt-cocking somewhere! (laughter) Flashing innocents through all the city! I can try and scrying eye him. I also still have one more 5th-level spell. I have a 6th. One more time. But I'm using my 5th-level spell first. Yeah, I'm using my 3rd. Still trying to get back? He's still trying to get back! No type of landmark? He's in the Vasper forest. Do you ever think there's a chance for Lady Briarwood to come back? Yeah. That's good to know. Yeah, group hug! He was in the tower. He was a decoy; we almost slayed him. We sent him off with Cassandra. Do I still have the remains of the broken trammel or did it shatter? I'm supremely uncomfortable. What? No! But I'm not a leader of these people. Okay. I step forward. (chuckles, sighs) The bravery of Vasselheim remains evident on this day, and you all should be proud that your reputation of a city unfallen by invasion or attack remains, and that is only because of the faith and the bravery and the strength of the citizens of this amazing city. We of Vox Machina are proud and honored to have fought by every single one of you, and we vow to continue to stand by your side through the rest of our days. Huzzah! To 1,000 years of Vasselheim! Huzzah! Yeah! 20 hit points now. No. It's not fair. He sacrificed himself in your name; you remain the only ascended. And yet he still loses? I'm not ready. Not without you. I'll find you. I promise. I'll see you again. Forever. I don't care. I don't accept this. I love you. This isn't fair. I guess we have to say goodbye. I love you, Vax'ildan. I'll see you again. Scanlan, have we ever told you you're an asshole? You got to sort through all your coffee stains. He's really irritable. Keyleth sits next to Vex and lays her head on her shoulder. I don't have the strength to argue with him. Aw. That might be the last natural one of this campaign. You have to scream it from a mountaintop, man. Betrayal. One man's trash. Yes? He taught me how to love and I have a hard time with interpersonal relationships. So I would've held onto that one for as long as I could've. And I still will. As I count you as mine. Going to have to look out for each other now. Also, fuck that raven bitch. What the fuck? You're smarter than a sword! Oh my god, you did it! Oh. I'm pretty sure you just handed out an apology after you just said you weren't going to hand out an apology. I think Percy is a walking contradiction. I thought-- wait, we-- Did you just sitcom mug? "Okay, Allura!" (laughter) You were quite an inspiration, Allura. I hope you know. You inspired me quite a lot. We know a lot about that. Allura, is Vasselheim going to be looking for members to join the council? Totally. No, right. I actually was, actually. I was thinking Pike, but I don't know-- Maybe they do a dry city after a certain time. Do you need any type of water, or anything we can immediately assist you with? Do you have somewhere to put it? I burn as many Create Water spells as it takes to fill them up. Yeah. She'll be fine. She'll be safe. To let him know that his daughter is still alive. Yeah. She's going to have to be introduced at some point. Hell yeah! Drunk as shit! Now's the time! Kima! We're bad influences. I see you're working the late shift. Well, we frontloaded our hours. Which one? You bug me about a lot of things. Yeah, and you ask me after I have a bit of alcohol in me. And I scry on Cassandra. Looks like she's been tended to like a proper de Rolo. Did I see Kaylie and Gilmore? She was not doing well. Gilmore was the most able-bodied. I'm assuming he got her there. I hope. I'll scry on the rest of them tomorrow. Thank you, Percy. You taught me just the right amount of how to be a shithead. Just enough. The most selfless. Second to you. (sighs) It's hard to think after a day that feels like a week, like today. I've got to get back to Zephrah. Greyskull? I don't think I can go back to Whitestone with you. I have to go back to Zephrah. Bad influences, all of you. Assholes. All right. One day. And then I want to not see your faces for a bit. We could go back to Whitestone whenever. I've still got a little bit of juice left. I do, believe it or fucking not. What? Oh, it was more of a rhetorical-- it's like a trick or treat-- why do we still try to explain things to him? I haven't learned. We can drunkenly walk there and take our time and enjoy the stars and we can-- oh! Scanlan-- Scanlan. We can do little arcane cantrips when no one's looking and break the rules a little bit. Of Vasselheim. Just cantrips, though. I know. What? What? I've lost the love of my life today. I'm allowed to be belligerent. Do you have that sandkheg shit? I am drunk enough to where I'm not going to stop it or argue against it, but I won't partake, so that's pretty good for me. Grog, you've had two weapons speak to you-- Grog, haven't we been through enough shit to know nothing's free? Fuck it. You insult our resolve and hold out on us all at the same time? Yeah! Yeah, no, this one won't work. No, this won't work. Sorry. Sorry. Next one. That one looks good. (slurred) See? When you travel-- wait, no. When you travel west to east, you gain time. See? (slurred) Happy hour is right now in Whitestone. Just saying. Okay. Heading home works. Cry myself to sleep? Oh, buddy! I cover Trinket with snot and tears as I sob into his belly. First night alone, but with Trinket. Aware of the gesture. I cry. Drool and eyeliner and dirt. Remember, I charcoal war-painted? Wait, where are you? In the middle of fucking Whitestone? Shut your mouth! Travis, pull good! Oh, please don't bring pit fiends on our heads. That can't be good. Did our internet go? (screaming and groaning) You fucking dick. You're a fucking dick! It is bad! You said you weren't going to bring the Deck of Many Things into the game, and then you did! (mispronouncing) Worst fucking timing! Internet has gone! Timing! Worst fucking timing! She doesn't get shit? She just watches? I guess we'll add that to our to do list. Yeah. So Grog's body is still there-- Catatonic. Sure, it's just an annoyance. Goddamn it! Wait, we spend two weeks? In what? I should be mourning right now, and I'm hunting your stupid ass down! Great therapy lesson. A healing trip. Keyleth backhands him with the hand that has the most rings on it, of power. Probably not! We can't even see you right now. You're a silhouette on the screen, but we can hear you. It might be a cheap joke. How fucked would that be? So fucked. Yeah. Girl power. I think I have the perfect place for this. Thank you. Thank you so much. I think it's perfect. Where are we going to put it? I think he'd like that. Something you have to stumble upon. It's a little hidden. Stealthy memorial! Grog was the reason for this season! Oh. It's 2017. When will we will have better Skype? Oh, Sam. 16 rites of passage. That's a lot of names. Very long names. The wonder bear. He prevents forest fires. (laughter) Penny Bear. (sighs) Okay. Naturally, help Pike rebuild Vasselheim in the most immediate of circumstances. Eventually retire to Zephra. Go be the actual leader of my people. Continue to get in any type of frays that these people invite me on as it reminds me of the good old days and keeps my promise to protect this realm any time this realm needs protecting. And I find Kerrick at some point. Seek out Kerrick. Make sure he's okay. Reconnect with him, have coffee, you know. Perfect. We're weekend buddies. We go to wine country. And then I work on the propagated sprig from the Sun Tree and continue to build it out, hopefully on the ley lines of the planet, and I take the feather that Pike gave me from Vax and I embed it into the trunk of the tree as well as any other relics from the Raven Queen I can find. Care for ravens as much as I can. And from the branch of the Sun Tree create my own raven tree of the Ashari. Take a long, long, long, long, long time before I maybe date again. Maybe. But eventually, hopefully, after a long, long, long, long, long time sunset into the tree and become a part of this realm. Ways off. But that's the plan. I don't think it's the faces that keep this light from fading. I think it is what it is. We're lucky to experience it, a few are lucky to think it's beautiful. You taught me that. I don't have to appreciate this. Especially not after what I've seen. But I do. Only because of what I've seen. Thank you. It's all I ever wanted. It's weird, once you reach a life goal and then realize you have the rest of your life. I guess I just find new goals. Sometimes it's hard being a prodigy because then you just grow up to be a regular adult. Thanks, Dad. I love you. Blow a kiss. Little scratch. Oh god. I had to get past this emotional chapter so I could get through the next one. (laughter) Best DM ever. We'll be back. That was beautiful.
