Is there ever going to be a situation where you're like, "You know what, a black chip will suffice. This'll be fine." And we didn't all come up with them last night. Okay. I tell them-- okay, yeah. We never did this in Critical Role. I am Sudis. Sudis Alifehr. I am a gypsy traveling vagabond who is quite good at telling your fortune. Whatever the cost, whatever the price, I can give you a little bit of wisdom that might guide you on your way. Sudis. Sudis Alifehr. I've got lots of braids all through my hair, and probably like in my mid-30s, and I also have a peg leg. Also, by the way? Peg leg. Romania. But it's also 1875, so who the fuck knows what was going on then-- Hi, Reverend! What just happened? Two reds and one blue. Do we get to know? I'm just saying that, you didn't need to, I could've told you that. Just saying. I know your gun looks cleaner than your face. Ooh, the Bella Union! Get off me. Wait, can I do an onus check on him to figure out what we did? This is a good place to actually make good money off of fortune telling. I'm going to go downstairs. Jules, did you spike our drinks last night? Was that you? Never mind. While the brawl breaks out, Sudis starts trying to palm a few coins. Oh, no! Oh, no, don't hurt me! Grabbing all the coins I can. I'm innocent, oh! Oh, no! Let me help you pick up your chips! Okay, so I roll a d6. I roll 2d6, is that what I do? And take the higher? I rolled five both times. Can I try and trip him? I want to reach out and grab his leg, see if I can trip him while I'm picking up-- Four. Four again. I don't know! Doubles, doubles. Well-- ow! You stepped on my finger! Ow! What is 'civilized'? Can I do a notice check to see if it's a real monkey or where the fuck the monkey came from? All right, I will! Wait. If I roll a six, do I roll again? On all checks? Nine. (yelps) (laughter) I take him and I try and spike him on the ground. Is he still there? Monkey. You see? I pet the monkey a bit. No, he's not very heavy at all, actually. He's only like five pounds or so. (sighs) I wander off and I start speaking off in my own language towards the sky. DONATION All right. (laughter) What do I call you? Manatou. Okay. Okay, Manatou. All right. We're going to go places, Manatou, me and you, bud. Me and you. Sure, yeah, notice check. Nine. That's probably true. That's accurate. Can I size him up from a distance? Get a bead on him? Five. Can I sit down in the corner and pull out my tarot cards? Kind of shuffle them. Fortunes! Come and get your fortunes told. Four. We love you, whoever you are. Oh jeez. All right. Can I do a notice check on him? Can I get a profile on him? Three. Not good at all. It's fine. I made the dollar. How else am I supposed to make a living? Yeah. I mean, these cards. They're still gambling, really. Cards are cards. Of course, I do. I can't help but notice that you have a mind for darkness, it seems. We're friends. We're not competing. Very well. Please, sit down. Ooh. I'm so excited. What kind of madness do you speak of? It's very loud in here. You are looking for mystic properties. Are you looking for a peek into your future, perhaps? You don't have to believe. That's what I always say. No! This is not the creature. It's too small! What's wrong? This thing-- I don't know, you frightened? Please. He likes you! Oh, you've made a friend! Do I notice if this is similar to my talking monkey? Okay. All right. Shitwalla? To the doc? We were sent here by the sheriff. He told us to find you. Yeah, I don't know. It might be his time. Just saying. Yeah, you can't take it back now, you'd be that dick. Have you noticed any suspicious activity in the town? We just arrived this morning. I don't know. I can think of many reasons to kill rich people. Many. You want to keep the bear? I foresee this bear possibly killing you in your future, but you know what, go for it. You have a good time with him. You have a good time. Hang on, wait! I'm going to use my snake oil salesman to contest your roll. You can do that, right? Your roll on the bear, the bear attacking him? Oh sorry, my knack of the seventh sun ability. Good, good. We could probably use him as bait. Are you asking permission to go speak to whore? If you want to go fuck whore, go fuck whore. You don't have to ask permission. Don't try and say you're interviewing whore when we know what you want. It's only matter of time. Sudis actually wanted to go talk to Dan. How do you say name again? Looking at the aura, the energy surrounding you, I don't think you'd pull that trigger, would you, Dan? What do I do? Five. I'm sorry. I just thought you might like a little bit of insight into your future. I can see great potential in you, Dan. All right. I was going to save your life, but have it your way. Oh, and watch your back. I'm quite calm. Do I look aroused? I don't-- Just the tip. Dan. Pull that trigger and it will be the last trigger you pull. So says the dark entity behind your shoulder. I'm going to use a black chip just to see if I can do better. Six again. Six. DONATION Sudi starts crying. No-- no English. (groans) I go over and I start talking to the whores, seeing if they want their fortunes told. I see many STDs in your future. Absolutely, darling. What's your name? So what does Lisa look like? Can I do a notice check on Lisa? Seven. Lisa, Lisa, come here, darling, Lisa. Let me get a good look at you. Looks like someone hurt you in your past. Da? So are you running or are you chasing pain, Lisa? Be careful. This work you do could very easily consume you. But it hasn't yet. Wait, the woman I was just talking to? I did not see that coming. Don't worry, we'll meet again, Dan. As well as the demon on your shoulder. Bye, demon! Bye-bye! (blows kisses) I made like five gold doing that. I did not touch that woman. I was simply giving her fortune. She just tripped. One of the other women pulled her down and she tripped and fell. It had nothing to do with me. Not everything is necessarily a pull of fate's strings, okay? It's sometimes shit just happens. Just itch. Bit of itch. Ah, Manitou. Just thinking out loud. Let's follow. I'm on my peg leg. Simon, was it? What brings you out here? You came quite fast. Yes! Yes! Right before her fist meets his face, I go, pain incoming. See? I can predict future! Schwerenger. There we go. What they call you, cousin? Or is your name Cousin? We've got a guy in the street. Did you recover any? He recovers every few hours, right? Ooh! I'm still standing next to Simon. Do I hear what he says? Ugh, I'm going to spend a reroll. Not much better. Three! Can I follow Simon? Stealthily, like blend in with the crowd behind him? I'm not trained in this. Ooh, I rolled a three, though, which is pretty good. Minus two. So one. Your palms are very sweaty. Don't touch again. You seem nervous. Why nervous? Mayor? Who made you mayor? I know, E.B., I know. And I reach out and I touch his face. Oh, don't worry, E.B., I don't have to be in your sights. I told you, you are only prolonging the inevitable. By 30 seconds, yeah. Sometimes people are just meant to die. Can I do an insight check on Sydney? Nine. I told you he was meant to die. We need to start at some of the mining locations. Some of the gold and silver veins. I know, but I think we should follow it towards one of the mining-- Well, it's a start. I peg leg behind. (stomping) What does the moon look like? So it's a full moon? Would I have any occult knowledge about-- --the moon, and maybe things come out at the moon times? (accented) That is a moon in the skies. (dice hitting the floor) Oh it was a four, can I keep it? You're not going to let me keep it. Three. I'm going to spend a blue to add a d6, right? Ooh, and a four. So seven! The full moon, it has mystical powers. I'd watch out for any type of lycanthropy in the area. You goods? You've had those hiccups for-- You shouldn't eat from the traveling street carts. Those are bad. Did you also eat from the travelling street cart? Don't eat from food trucks! You fucking-- What? Well, that's fine. Just straight smarts? I'm going to re-roll. Do I re-roll both, or which one? The big one? That's not great. Ugh. Five! Don't bait me, Matthew Mercer. I know what you're doing. Trying to get me to use all my tokens. (growling) Yeah, the blue one. No wait. I don't want blue. I want a red. Oh, because he gets one, right? All right, I'll just use the blue. I already threw it to you. I would like a d6. Ooh, that's good, ten! You know there are certain things that really like silver when they're also lycanthropes. Like. I don't know, do I know things that might like silver? I know certain things are afraid of silver. They hate silver. My immediate thought would be, if I was werewolf-- That's what lycanthropes are, werewolves. If I was werewolf and had vulnerability to silver, I'd want to control all the silver. So... That way no one can hurt me. Or a bear, or it could be other beasts. I also saw Cy run very quickly right before the moon came out. Just saying. I think we should keep an eye on Simon. If it's full moon then he's out in beast form. We have good chance of finding him in beast form. So do you add the d4 and the d6 together? Three. The mines? Mm-hmm. I still say we use him as bait. Probably wouldn't have. I've got a lantern. I come in with a lantern. Come on, Jules. The ladies are leading the way. What do we see? So they bought the mine simply to-- LAURA and Da. All right. We should probably get silver-- yeah. Can we get some silver pieces? I'll take the other four pounds. 1d4. We should go deeper. Before we walk off I go, Sydney, catch! And I toss him a piece of silver. Just... I thought it'd be good if we all had some. I've got the lantern. I'm great, it was my knee. My knee deflected. Son of a bitch! Can we use fate chips to redraw cards? Fucking fuck! No. I'm going to spend a fate chip to counter your reroll. Running out of fate chips. Three on my guts. What did you use? Just roll a d6? 2d6. Ooh, six. Seven, total. Blue chips, I don't have any blue chips to counter. Hey, that's good! Same thing, yeah, do it. Nice! How far away are they? Still far enough away to where I can shout at them? Sudis will shout, if you run, only death will come and find you, and I'm going to attempt to try and shaken them. Ooh, I rolled an eight with a five, so that's 13 plus two. 15. I told you. I told you. Should we chase after people who were following us? Or should we maybe check other silver mines? The accent's already rubbing off on you. Four. Yeah, to whoever did that. Big money, no whammies, yeah! Go, Laura, go! Are we trying to end the game at one minute? I'm going to start walking up to it, and I'm going to say, tonight is the night that you die, and I'm going to attempt to shaken it with my persuasion thing. Because I have it, this I get to just add a d6 to the roll, right? Fucking fuck. Ooh, 11 plus another five, so that's 16. How far away am I from it? Can I walk up to it and make it? 20 paces. You're going to die. No, you're not! No. That a red? Is not in the cards for you, my friend. Four. Two wounds or just one wound? No. I shook it off. This is Simon doing this? Is he shaken, though? Thanks, chat. Thank you for that. Well, we only had five minutes left in the stream. And 100% of the proceeds from those shirts are going to the MDA. I wish I had a few more minutes to wreak havoc. Just a few more is all I needed. That was fun. What's happening now?
