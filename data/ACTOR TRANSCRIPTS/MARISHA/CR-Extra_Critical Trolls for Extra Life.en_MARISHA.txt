Our characters or ourselves? Oh, hello, I'm Marisha Ray, and you can catch us on Critical Role on Thursday nights, and I'm a voice actor, and actor, and host, and all that stuff, and today I'm playing D&D. She was just getting a dime bag. It's fine. Roll again and hope it's another 20. Oh, god. Hello! I'm Edna, and I'm 79 years young! Can you believe it? (laughs) I know, that one gets them every time. CHAT What does that stapler do? You know, I might be able to Detect Magic on it, you know, I have been doing a little bit of studying. Who says an old dog can't learn new tricks, am I right? Let me see. What? I can't? What? I'm sorry, I'm a little hard of hearing. What? What? Cat? You're a kitty cat? Oh. Oh, what was your name, Sonny? You know, he's a bit young. Don't you think he's a bit-- he's a very young boy. I may not-- I'm a bit hard of seeing but I-- Who are you? The chat room? I'm sorry, once again, hard of hearing, Sonny Boy-- The chateau? Yes, I've been to the chateau-- The shitter? The shitter is right around the corner. Oh, you know that voice-- are you referring to that voice? I heard that too. Did you hear that? Is that what we're talking about now, I don't know-- Okay. Oh wait, let me-- can I Detect Magic on that stapler? I do have Detect Magic. Can I tell what kind of magical force? You know, I have to take a little bit more time with it, but I feel like it might have some sort of protective qualities to it. Is that Metamucil? Is that what that is? Ah yes, I forgot to take mine today. What? Did they say Edna? Edna says what randomly now? I have Tourette's and I say what? Balium and Desmond? If I could get a confirmation on what my Tourette's entails. Classic voice-to-speech not knowing what the shit nerds say. You mean Asmodeus? Asmodeum? Is that what he said? Oh, Asmodeum! Belial! (laughter) Asmodan. No. Yes. Asmodan. He's so cute. Would you like a chocolate chip cookie? I raised two children in my day, I always keep a good pastry on me. Here. Come here little-- Belial! Stephan! Come here. Come here-- Asmodan! Come here. What? No. Look, I know I look old and scary but trust me I was quite the hot little shimmy back in the day, Asmodan. I think my eyesight must be going because-- I could swear I see two men riding giant tigers in the distance. I really need to get some glasses. I'm telling you, need to get my eyes checked. 19. 14. Correct. What are we doing? What are we fighting? We're fighting these assholes? I had a 14. CHAT So there's a goliath riding a tiger? Coming this way? All right. Oh boy, Magic Missile! I'm going to do all three at him. So 1d4 plus four times three. So that's-- Those are not good rolls. Six. Rolled ones every time. Six damage. Yeah. (yelping) Belial! Asmodan. It's super effective. It's a druid spell. Does that stapler still appear to be magical? What? I'm fine. Yes, here. Can I see it? Can I detect any magic? Does it look pretty meh? Stephen, how old are you? Oh that's good, that's old enough. That's how old my boys were when they had their first swords, yes, yes, that's a good age. This is really bad for my orthopedics. Not my strong suit...that's not a good roll either. Three. Oh, Asmodan! Watch my back, Cort. (groans) I'm not as nimble as I used to be. Oh, be careful. I do that all the time. You got to be careful. I actually have one of these buttons so I can call for help if I ever trip and fall down. Yes. It's a life alarm, yes. What was his name? Mucus? What? Mucus? That's such a strange name for an imp. I feel like we should do something about Cort. Oh, new maps, new maps! New map things! Look, it's a new thing! Don't die, Mucus. Oh, we're rolling initiative, right. Oh, 60k! (cheering) It's true. Yeah, we're going to die. We're going to die. Yeah, looks like he's on some serious hallucinogens. That wasn't the repeat one, there was another one as well? Oh, hello there little one! Oh, my AC is 11. Snugglelord, control your son! (laughter) Oh! You have a pillow shield. Moving in the right direction. Don't ever look a gift pillow in the mouth, all right? Draw good ones! You just went to like level 12. Hey, shut up! Oh, we didn't hear it. No, we were bitching. That's amazing! Also, you get some fun new abilities real quick. You can probably add more points to your intelligence. Use the hammer! All right, so I have one guy on my butt? Okay, so question. Jesus. Oh, goodness me. As part of being a conjuration wizard, I can do a minor conjuration as an action, and I can just conjure things that are up to ten pounds. Can I conjure a ten-pound rock over his head? Okay. So I'm going to turn around and be like, I told you to get your son away from me, Snugglelord! And I drop a ten-pound rock on his head. Five total. I'm still new at this! I'm still learning. What? Belial! What? It's a brown bear, right? At the very, very back. Plus strength. Five, right? What's your strength? Plus two. Help me! I've hit my head and I can't get up. What? I'm sorry, you're going to have to speak up-- What? Oh, Asmodan. I missed you too, Snugglelord. Wait, Stephen's now a monk? That's hilarious. I'm hoping so. Is he still seven? "Oh, Kurt! Thank you so much, my sweetie patootie!" (laughter) What? I've got nice cans? Why thank you, I know! You should've seen me when I was 20! What? Oh, it's my turn. Okay, am I still surrounded by anything? "Is that your son, Olaf, or is that a goblin? Is that a gob-- Magic Missile!" Two, five, ten! We got to level up Dan Casey! What level is Stephen, by the way? Level one monk, all right. What? I take seniority shit around here! I'm old! Oh, I have an 18! What was it? Persuasion? 20 total. Look, you see, I've been around for quite some time, and I have had to live under the patriarchal values of this kingdom, and you know what? It's really tough being a woman. I had to birth two big, strong boys out of me. And you know what? My good late Charles husband, God rest his soul, he was a good husband, but he-- What? Yes. I don't think so. I think it just makes me Ed. Yes, I do. What do I look like? Am I handsome? It's 2015! We can be progressive, god damn it! I didn't even get to see what my member looked like! That's really unfortunate! What? Why? Just because? I just want you to know, Kurt, that this doesn't change anything. You were open-minded when I was a man, and now-- Okay. Ooh! 25. Ah, yes. I think we were standing next to what we were looking for the whole time. I don't know. I was talking to you via comms, I don't know why. This explains why it's been a very weird day. I go ahead and cast Mage Armor on myself. Go get them, tiger! Edna, you're up. You know, this has probably been one of the most exciting days of my life. Blindness! Asmodan! I mean, shit, what? You asked a question? What are you, 30 feet? 13. What? I'll back up a bit, if I can. I don't know where exactly I am, but-- I need to remain-- oh, you know what, let me shift on in a bit so I can see. I'm Edna. Did you say me? Ten. CHAT If we sing a musical? Aw, pooper. (singing) I do have more high-level spells. And to this I say, Asmodan! And I cast something from my higher-level spells. Sure! (singing) I'll Lightning Bolt him! (singing) Wait, this is unfair. I was being led and baited by the dungeon master! (singing) Shit. (singing) 8d6, my damage is! (singing) 16 plus another four, so that brings it to 20. That was six. How many? Eight? Shut up. What did I say? 20? So that's 28. 28 damage. 28, 28 damage. (singing) Oh no, I just hit my lover with lightning! I just hit my lover with lightning! (singing) I just want to point out, this was a suggestion from the Dungeon Master. (singing) I didn't have to roll. Oh no, is he unconscious? One more time, all together! The musical is complete? I have never seen a party of more strong and powerful women. I just want to say that. I know, we are like the Golden Girls. Thelma and Louise. Oh right, the whole reason we came here. Is Victor still alive or did he die, right? Victor exploded? Oh shit! Oh my god, you get the Wish spell one! You can't fuck it up! Unfortunately, I was hoping it'd make me younger again, but I'm still an old woman. Why are you suddenly Southern? I happily accept Kurt's hand in marriage, but beforehand I feel like I just need to get some adventuring out of my system first, and I hear there's this man. He's, like, a tiefling, and they call him something like the Bounty Hunter, or the Broker, or something like that, and, I don't know. Maybe he's looking for more mercenaries. I think I'll join up with him. Okay. She goes on an Avatar journey! It's Lorde with an E.
