That's the winner! (laughter) That's going to be the next show I produce. "Let's Make a Poll" with Sam Riegel. Keep going. Speaking of shows I produce! (cheering) Right? Am I right? So Signal Boost is back! It never went away, you didn't realize that, but it's back. (laughter) It feels like it went away. It did not! You just forgot about it, it's back with Damion Poitier. He's awesome. He was Thanos, the first Thanos before he got replaced because celebrities are dicks. And-- Right, he was also Chains in Payday, which is what everyone has been now shouting at us through Twitter. He was. He gets killed in Civil War-- Technically tranquilized. Apparently, is what he clarified. Anyway-- Other than being Chains being on social media, people have also shouted he's very attractive and sexy, so maybe that's a selling point for you. So you should go watch it. It's out right now, his second episode is out this past Tuesday. Go watch him! He's funny, he's very charming. (sings) Merchandise! The guys like to get 'em and put them on their middle fingers, so that you can flick off-- Oh, nice, the patchwork ones? Those are good. I'm just showing up on the beach. We had just landed. No, there was one that I might have crushed underneath me that went down. There were also others on the ship, correct? Yeah. You know, there might be a couple, if they're real good swimmers, they might make it? With severe burns. And psychological damage. But-- maybe? Thanks. Also my Control Weather spell should still be active. So nature check? Druid check? What the shit is happening check? Nurture check? Nature versus nurture check? 14? I toss Percy his gun. As a druid, would I recognize if this is an air elemental situation? Ugh, why are they always intelligence-- Natural 20! Bigger? Badder? Aw snap! (sighs) This isn't great. I don't, either. I'm assuming there hasn't been enough time to where we've taken a short rest, correct? Not good, you guys. Five. (clears throat) Five. [no audio] from the last fight. [no audio] (singing) It takes two, baby! Yeah. We need to have breakfast. What the fuck. Both? It'll work. They take half damage for shit. Well, you take damage and then whatever damage that you take that is carried over into your real form. So if you take 80 hit points, you'll take you know, the ten that your eagle form took and then you'll take the other 70. You'll be fine. You're Grog. You got it. It's also the air druid you've been travelling with. Uses a lot of lightning. (coughs) What's up, brah? Yeah, that hits. That also hits. Oh hey, Gary, what's up? Aww man. God damn it, Gary. You were always a dick. 14? Okay. 27 total. Okay. So not feeling great about this one. I could try and talk to them, but that never goes well, let's be real. So I'm going to cast Wind Wall. Okay, here's my question. I'm having a hard time seeing, so help me. That's me. Who's that? Okay. I have a 50-foot Wind Wall that I can shape whichever way I want? So what I want to do is try and loop us all in and go around, Jesus, go around this way. Yes. Like a semi-circle starting with this guy going this way. 50 feet. Because it can go over top of guys. So starting 50 feet going around this way. The other way, but yeah. I mean it's 50 feet, it'll work. I guess it doesn't ultimately matter. A circle. I want to block the three guys out with my 50 feet. I want to go over top of them. And keep us nice and safe and comfy in a wind basket. Whatever 50 feet will cover. Because there's a little overlap, so can I start it with this guy and then go around to where that couple feet goes to this guy? Oh, okay! That's all I care about. I say That's a big tornado. I can make a bigger one! 19. Uh-huh, and they should be gaseous forms, if I'm not mistaken, which means they can't move through it. That's right they are! I'm done. I'm excited. That's my thing. That's all I do. Oh, sorry. Nature! 13 damage! Not great. 13 total. Can I now shift away from the guy? He can't move through. I'll turn to them and be like Let's do the mirror game, man! Do the mirror game, yeah? And that's it. You've seen Sharknado. Percy, we've got cows! You'll reach triple digits some day. Sorry, you left our huddle. You hit so easily. He rolled six, six six. From the inside! Kill it. Kill it. We're level elitists for two more games. It should only affect ranged attacks. It should only affect ranged attacks and gaseous creatures because I doubled checked that. Can it do that? It can move through the wind? Keep going. I'm going to cross-reference that. Keep going. I'm just checking. Nah, keep going. See how tall it is. All right, yep. Nope. It is 15 feet high. You're correct. He hops the fence. Who, me? What? Strength? 19! Goddamn it, Gil! You're an anomaly. We wonder why there's the West Nile virus. Percival, he who breaks wind. (laughter) 15. Right in the middle. I suddenly remember the letters that I stole from the ship, and I say Percival! And I pull them out. I'm not giving them to you! I'm going to look at them with you. Okay, upon looking at them, I don't get it, and I hand them to him. That was for Bad News? Do we have time? Oh, you're going to drag my shame into shore? So wait, what are the two marbles? They look like rocks! So it's like a stone? Is it pretty? That's cool. They're flares. That's cool. That was the perfect interaction. Can I keep an eye out for that flower? I grab a few, put them in my bag. Yeah, I second that question. And can I keep my senses aware for aboriginals of the island? Natural 20. 22. And does the vegetation seem to be getting thicker? (whispering) You got this. (whispering) I believe in you. (quietly) But there might be. We do know, for whatever she has, blocked my scrying. So whatever it is blocked my magic. Percy, I think you are the distraction. Are you going to be the distraction? Well, hang on. If we have the flares that she recognized with her crew, why not use the flare that her crew has? It won't alarm her to an outsider. She already got away from us once by using magical abilities to blink out of existence. We have to make sure we lock her down so she doesn't run. Scanlan, can you do that? I have a Hold Person spell. I can try and hold her. I'm going to creep forward and towards Grog, but being very stealthy. 20 total. I'm going to try and hold Ripley with a Hold Person. I can lock her down. I'm going to take a few steps forward, like two boxes forward, and I'm going to release a Hold Person on Ripley. Casting it, yeah. I'm not letting it go. 19. She's got to make a wisdom save. Fucking fuck it. 19. Oh my god. (cheering) Did you say we have-- no, he has advantage. 12. Wow. We walked right into that one. All right, overweight. Don't fucking fail me now. That's all right. Is that Gil's dice again? Yeah, same here. All right. Bitch. Ten. Yeah, you have to roll above your damage. Oh my god! Shut the fuck up! You've got this. My dead body. I third that. If we can all get together, I actually brought Heal today because Pike wasn't here. Okay, I stand up, very irritated, and I grab Percy, and I pull him to me, and I cast Heal on him, my 6th-level spell. I'm fucking burning it for you. So full 70 points because he's almost down. It's not! I should have grabbed Mass Cure Wounds, but I was wrong. So I grab Percy and I say Fucking finish this bitch. Finish this. I let him go, and that's my turn. Healing Percy. Fucking kill her, man! I'm going to my last whatever movement I have to step back a little bit, because I'm really fucked up. If I can step back, whatever I can. I know I stood up, so I know I have half movement. I'll get behind Trinket, and I'm not looking good. I'm really tapped out. Not looking good. It's like the Crazy 88; they just keep coming. I like interesting thoughts. I'm hiding behind Trinket. Come on, Percy. People made fun of Thor walking across that rainbow bridge. It's like a Pink Floyd tribute concert. She's got a magical cloak of fuckery. It was good, but you have to reroll it. I'm sorry, man. Oh! Same thing! Wait, that's a thing? A triple violent-- why haven't you done that? How are you, Grog? Are you all right? Triple violent shot? You're going to jump? Is he the one on the thing? Is he the mage? All right, I am burning my 7th-level spell and really fucked up behind Trinket, I'm going to think about the air elementals on the beach, and what they just did, and I'm going to cast Whirlwind, and I'm going to aim for the mage on the crevasse booby. Right on the nip. (laughing) We ruin everything you make. Oh, you built this? Looks like a dick. Okay. No, over on top of the mage. I have a 300-foot range. Can I get the guy in the crevasse? The 30-foot-high? Yeah, I'll suck them all up. 19. Oh, the goliath? What? TRAVIS, TALIESIN and 10d6?! It's like Christmas! One, two, three, four, five, okay. Oh, that's fine! Okay, so that's-- wait, what was that? What was that, Taliesin? I pushed it. Was it a two? It was a four? Okay. Six, plus five is 11, plus four is 15, plus another four is 19, plus another two is 21. That was five! Not as good this time. What did I say, 21? 26, 30, 32, 35, 36! Wait, is he restrained or is he flung? Because it's vague on what happens. He's stuck in a tornado. If he tries to break free? Well, that's fun. Yeah. I've never done this before, so this is cool. Yeah. Can I do that now? Or next turn. I didn't! That's true, where was Ripley last seen? That's probably what I would try to do. I would push it that way. Yep. He's fucked. Yeah. He's stuck in a tornado. She has to save from it. She either gets sucked up in it or flung, so she's going to get fucked either way. I don't know. It's not necessarily a spell on her. I made the spell around her. What? No, come on. Kynan? Little shit. I get plus five? That hits. My armor class is 17 plus five, so that's 22. I swear to god, if he drops me, I'm going to be so pissed. Okay. All right. What do I have to roll over? Ten total. Kynan! Hey, man! What's up? Hell yeah, man. Can you Dimension Door? That sucks, man. He can just go oh, Toto! That evolved real quickly. What did we just do? What? No fucking shit. He doesn't get thrown? What a dick. Do I have advantage because I'm behind Trinket or anything? Do I have cover? I have advantage because my armor is resistant against spells, right? I'll take that 12. It's not great. 17. Honestly, I thought I was going to be able to last around to the next round. (incredulously) I take what? Oh, wow! What kills you in this game? I have to go past my total HP? Well I'm negative 58 now. I just go to zero. I don't go negative. But do I still have to count going negative? (thunk) Does he take falling damage? Yay, Scanlan! Yeah! Yeah, it was! Ooh, jesus christ. Remember those break-falls you practiced? Like in basketball in high school? Do that. Yeah. Both of your healers are out, bee tee dubs. Are you out, too? Come on, Percy. Me and you, man. We're out. Yeah. Wha-bam! Everyone looks down for a second and processes? Come on. Die, die, die. Die. Yeah, he does! Fuck you. Fucking shit. Because he's stunned? Wait, are you whaling on this kid? Ooh! I'm not going to die to this bitch. You're still alive. It was enough to keep you al-- oh my god, man! No, no, no! I spent a 6th-level spell to keep you alive, man! She's not even here! When did she fucking give you that, man? 11. (yelling) Fuck! Aw, fucking Orthax, really? That's a name I was hoping I wasn't going to hear again. You're like the Olympian judging the newer Olympian. I just broke my glass by biting into it. She's out? She's gone? But she's got fancy things. Okay, so I'm waking up, and the first thing I heard was Grog saying, "Orthax or Ripley?" Correct? Fucking gods! And I'm going to throw down a Daylight spell on the nipple. The crevasse nipple on stage right. My stage right. Daylight on nipple, stage right! But I thought Orthax is a shadow fiend, right? And he's having a hard time? I thought we're under tree cover, no? I have burned through everything that's nice like that. Okay, never mind. I'm going to get up and I'm going-- I can't do that. I'm done. I'm going to-- Fuck it. Percy, kill them! And I'm going to Cure Wounds at level three. Fucking kill her! This is your post-traumatic stress that we're dealing with here! It's 3d8 plus ten. Yeah, 22. Fucking kill her! And then I'll actually take a bonus action to do a Healing Word on myself at level one Yeah. I'm still coughing up blood in the fetal position, trying to keep Percy alive. To hit me? Yeah. We'll see. Probably, though. I don't like being unconscious! Okay, keep going. This is the worst game of Minesweeper. I know. Your inner insecurities cannot be the cause of Vox Machina's death. 30 total. Misses. Wait, did he find her? An effect that you are unfamiliar-- what the shit, man. I stood up, too, to cast-- what was it that I cast last? No. No, that was a long time ago. Oh, I did cast Healing Word. Yes, I cast Cure Wounds and heal, so I'm up. Am I? Fuck. All right, keep going. That's fine. Oh shit. I'm up, okay. I'm fucking alive. Running out of options here. Ripley's not on the board or anything, right? We only have Orthax in front of us, and he's all that's left? Wow, this isn't good at all. Wow, cool. All I have left is a Thunderwave. So in a fit of fight or flight-- What? That's all I've got. In a fit of fight or flight, as I'm standing up, I smack down on the ground and hit a Thunderwave around me, because that's all I have. It'll hit who? Vex? Only Orthax? Cool. No, fail. Ooh, 11 damage. No, sorry, ten damage. I stand up, and as a reaction, I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself once again at first level. I heal eight points. I look at him, and I stare daggers into him and shake my head and wipe the blood off my mouth. No, he's going to kill me. Moo-vies! Fucking fuck, this is not good, guys. Come on, Percy. Big money, no whammies. Wait, is this it? It was on the money. What? She's bamfing, is that what she's doing? Come on, Grog! Come on! Kill her. Grog, kill her. Can you inspire yourself? Have you done that yet? Shut up! You have to roll a ten! Are you down? Are you unconscious? Kill Orthax. That's literally your best bet right now. Even if I had something, I couldn't do it. Ashley's texting quite a lot right now. Oh fuck. Oh Jesus. (groans) How close is Orthax to me? Seeing Percy fall, all I have left is Thunderwave, and I'm going to do it at 5th-level because that's all I have left. I rolled all sevens. So seven, 14, 21. Oh shit! What did I say? 21 plus another eight, which is 29, plus another eight, which is 37. Plus another six, which is 43 points of thunder damage. No. I do, as well. Goddamn it, Gil, you better not fuck me. Not bad, Gil. (laughs) Are we doing melee attacks, or spell attacks, or what? I'm going to take a Grasping Vine and choke her around her throat. (tearfully) I do the same. What? Why would you do that to us? I have nothing left. Wait, is that it? We need to know, because if that's it, then we've got to go get drinks. (laughs) That was our promise. Not today! I'm totally depleted until we sleep. In the bag of colding? You're going to make us deal with this for a fucking week? I've grown a lot of emotional attachment to this. What?! She doesn't work. She is desperately wanting to get in. Yeah! Nothing left under a 3rd-level spell. I have nothing left. Shut up, Sam! What? We don't have faith at this table!
