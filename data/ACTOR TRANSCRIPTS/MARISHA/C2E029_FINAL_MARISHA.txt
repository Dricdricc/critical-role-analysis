(drum sounds) I love the cheers for foresight. They're like, "Yeah, two mics! Yes! Get it, production team!" Do they look like Iron Shepherds? No, don't worry about it, it's fine. You want to flank the door with me? You're not with me. You want to flank the door with me? We are dressed like guards. Where are we? Are we on the outside of the cellar or are we down? Where's the body of the other guard we killed? Is he just chilling? We just killed him, man. Okay, so we'll go up into the cellar and I'm going to open the hatch and say Help me out. And shove the guard's-- Nott, let's put him in the cage and maybe he'll-- You know Caduceus, I think there's actually merit to your plan. I'm kind of into it. Damn shame. Just stay here in case-- when Caleb and Keg get back. We're going to have them chase the escaped prisoners. Keg doesn't have object permanence. [laughter] I'm going to face away since I don't have the disguise spell and look really perturbed towards the prison. I say shut up you miscreant and I backhand Nott. "I have his face though." Yeah, he had the disguise spell. 12. Not great. Oh what? Aw, cool! Wasn't expecting that. The one who drew his blade-- I'm going to try and take an elbow and do a knockout crack right to his temple. That wasn't a Gil die, but I'll let you know when it happens. 19. 11 damage and can I do a stunning strike? Crack. Fail! It's only worked like once before! As he backs up, I'm going to take his head and slam it back into the wall he just ran into. Good, because that was a natural one. 17. 11. I'm going to say Shut up! And crack him across the face again with my bonus, my off-handed. That was a Gil, but he did good. 19. Nine damage. Shh, go to sleep. I'm going to take my scarf, wipe the wall. I'm going to shout out Hey Keg, we got a runner! I don't know if she heard me or not. I say Never mind, Deuces got him. It's not great. Ten. This place is fucking haunted. Follow it. We got to follow it first. Yeah. It looks really good on you, man. [laughter] Oh. Sorry. I'll follow Nott. 18. Can we do the thing? The Brady Bunch where all of our heads are stacked while we peek around the door. Nope. That's not good. Seven. Ooh. No! That's not good. Okay. I come around the gate. I look in and I go, hey, Shakäste! What's up? What're you doing out here? I'm going to hold my action and start wedging my staff up under the door, and maybe Deuces can help me crank it open. Oh. Cool, man. Yeah. I'm not doing something really important here to keep our friends from reaching their peril. Real cool, man. Keg? That's okay. With our legs... lower back, you know. Wise as fuck. No, there's definitely sexual tension. So much sexual tension. They had a thing. Miss. 17. Oh, hits! I'm going to use my reaction to deflect missiles. Oh, I rolled a nine. Sorry! I should have dictated that. I would probably have disadvantage if I'm throwing it back through? (high pitched hum of uncertainty) [cheering] Monk shit! Can I get a "Don't fuck me, Gil"? [cheering] I got this for you. [laughter] Yeah, I know. Okay, I'm going to wait for Keg so we can hoist. Man, it was really light actually, I don't-- Beau is aroused. I move through as well if I can. Okay, copy. He's invisible, too?! Everyone knows this trick! (laughing) Yeah, fuck you. Sorry. Is it a-- or a button? I halt everybody, and I say Wait. I don't know. This feels like we're being lured right into a trap. We're following him. Caleb? He's dead. You know, Keg, I feel like we don't need a man's approval for a plan, necessarily. [cheering] I don't have a plan! I'll hold my action in case I see anything, by the way, with my turn, if that's okay. Oh! Can I move in? I want to move in. I was talking to everybody. Mm-hmm. That's good. Yeah, can we all convene in this room? Before we do anything else. What about this door? I'll help search the room as well. I'll look for any other triggers or passageways. I have one goodberry left over from Nila that she gave me that I didn't eat. So I'm going to hand him the goodberry-- I'm going to feed him the goodberry. What, you don't like berries? Yeah. Antioxidants, you know. Oh, no! Electrolytes... I say, Hey. When was the last time you've seen Lorenzo? Did he go this way? Has he come back? While he does that, I'm going to go immediately for the gate and look at that, into the stairs, and see what the deal is. I'm going to investigate it and see how I can potentially open it if it's locked, yeah. I jump back. Oh. I rolled a two. So nine. Aah! While it's going, I'm going to see if I can yank open the thing! (whining) Can I do athletics? [laughter] (singing) Don't fuck me... MARISHA and Mm, 15! Yeah! (grunting) I'm still trying to help! (grunting) Keg, do I look buff? (grunting) Thank you! 12. We drop down. As Deuces and Shakäste come down the stairs, I say Does this look bad to you? And I show them my scorched, really burnt arm, because it hurts real bad. Yeah, that was kind of my question. I just didn't want to ask outright. Yeah. (laughter) Uh... Eh... (laughter) Hang on. Let's wait for the-- For the healers-- The clerics to finish their council. But Shakäste, I got you that nice arrow. Yeah, now I want it. Thanks, man. Thank you! 14 points. Lorenzo has a red room! Oh, thank you! AUDIENCE Lemonhead, I think is the name of the company? Lemonhead? AUDIENCE I think we're back. We're back. Yeah. Oh god. I have 41 hit points. Out of now 51. Deuces. Aw, buddy. Silver linings! Do you think they would grant you the graces that they did before and spare you if they saw you? Oh, Shakäste! There's a really long story. She used to work for them. I agree. It can't make noise though, right? Oh, we're going to do a ventriloquist act. Okay. Well, last thing that we want is for them to have the element of surprise on us. So as long as we can get them out. It's going to suck either way, and I don't want to die, but we might die. What was that thing you said earlier? Fucko? What was that? I liked that. That feels solid. Yeah. I'm glad you workshopped it. Never throw out your first draft. You know, never show that. That's great. That's good. I admire that. That's true. You're deviating though, from the brand, you know? Fucking chrome dome! Nailed it. Works every time. Hey, fucking chrome dome. We're workshopping a bit. Could be on the movie poster. It's great. Nailed it. Come on! Yay? Above average. Maybe it's a trap. Maybe it's definitely a trap. Nott, can you Mage Hand and lift up the little leather skirt of the table, and see what's under there? It's motion-sensored. It's Protto. Maybe it's Protto and that lackey. And then they had that hired hand with them. I still got firecrackers. Just throwing it out there. Yeah? I take out a cherry bomb. I light it, I throw it. Wait for it... Wait for it. All right, go! Go! Go! Aah! Aah! Do they seem distracted? I'll tumble down the stairs, doing a barrel roll and some parkour shit. Can I tuck behind the wall? Yeah, and crouch and peek. Oh god! Five. Right? That was a two, plus three. Five. Thank the gods. Did you say roll for initiative? 18. I know, so spooky! Come on! Come on, girl! Aw. Okay! (air horn) I'm going to pop around the corner. Pop around, and I'm going to go towards where Nott is. Keep going. Do I see anybody to my left? I go, 'Sup! (pow) (laughter) Doubling the dice damage. Ooh, that's a seven! So 14 plus four, 18. That's cool. I'm going to take my off hand, I'm going to run and just take the edge of my arm into his throat. Second strike, 14? Not great damage six damage. Okay, I'm going to take palm to his nose and try and bat his head back into that sconce behind him. Last hit, last hit. That's not good 12. Yep, I'm going to stay here and just be on this guy. You're in full poop stance? (quietly) This fucking sucks, right? Yep, that hits. Yeah. Miss! The second one. Oh, I thought you said the other fuck and I was like, he is a fuck! Still heard it! Same thing. Keep going. Ah! Hell yeah. I was going to say sentinel, I don't want him getting away. Hm, 15. No 16! 16. Yes! All right, not bad. Ten damage and he is not moving. Bish! (whispering) Shakäste! Plus seven. I know! This little shit. Where is Prada? Devil Wears Prada, where is he? In the white thing? I'm going to go kill this guy because he's pissing me off. I'm going to do my movement, I'm going to parkour off of the table that he knocked over, going to use Keg's shoulder to get the rest of the way over. Front barrels into the door! Miss. [cheering] Macy's Day Parade balloon; it's not good right now. It's bad. Okay, I'm going to unleash on Prada. Okay, first one. Ah, Gil gave me a natural one. (singing) Fuck you, Gil. Ah! Why'd you put spikes on it?! Fuck! Ow! Okay, next one. 17. Okay, nine. Flurry of Blows. Three. Okay. First attack-- that's cocked. I'm sorry, it was a good one too. Oh, it's the same roll though 19! These are two off-handed, right? Okay, eight damage on the first one. And second one, same exact roll. 19 again. And same roll again, nine. Two nines, 18 total damage. SAM and Just throw in a few more! (cheering) That's my turn. Damage?! Are you still conscious? Ten. [groaning] (groaning) It's oddly painful. She sucks. She's going to be the MVP, man. I can feel it. When it works, it's going to be glorious. Thank you, girl! Thank you! Girl power! Yeah! Okay, I'm going to turn around, and can I quickly flip the table that Protto had flipped over-- flip it back onto its legs? (impact) Then I'm going to-- Mm-hmm. I'm going to jump on it. (singing) Jump on it! Then I'm going to take my bonus action to do Patient Defense. I'm going to look at Lorenzo and be like Your new look sucks, man! Then do Patient Defense. Oh my god, Keg. This is just like Titanic. Just me and you, floating on this-- He gets into real estate. Do I get a thing? No! Why?! Faerie Fire is one of the best fucking spells, man! I'm going to do the same thing I am going to crouch down and I'm going to pull two ninja stars, and I'm going to hold my action until I see Lorenzo. Do I have range? I think I see him! We get our held actions for when we see him, though, first? (nervously) Okay. First one is an 18, second one's a 17. Both hit. First one. 13 damage. Second one-- wait! No, I'm wrong. These are throwing stars. Wrong die, I was doing my melee attack. First one. Okay. Seven damage. Second one five damage. Six. Beau is unconscious. Huh? What?! Whoa! (gasps) What does Spare the Dying do? I get up. Still have 20 feet of movement left. Can I make it to Lorenzo? God, I'm so mad. How far away am I? God, that sucks! I'm going to use a ki point to get there. (grunts) Step of the Wind. Hope that was a good call. I'm going to unleash on him, because I'm fucking pissed. First attack. Uh-huh! Yep! 24. [cheering] All the rage and fury. And-- I'm going to spend my last ki point to do Stunning Strike. I go full Ip Man on the next attack with advantage. So everyone has advantage. Oh god, I thought it was a natural 20, but a 21 total! Wait, did I do damage for the first one? No, okay. I'll use this for the first roll, which will be seven points of damage. Yeah? Second roll. Ugh, that was a one. Five points of damage, and then my last bonus action attack with advantage. Same roll, 13 on both. No, a 16. I'll take that 16, plus seven? That hits, and then eight damage. Pop-pop-pop! He's stunned for a round. Everyone has advantage? Attack rolls. I turn around and with all the rage, popping blood vessels, I say (shouting) Fuck him up! [cheering] They all have advantage, so roll twice. Big money, big money! That's good! All right, seeing where Nott just put a bunch of bolts in him, I'm going to flat hand, palm the bolts right deeper into him. First one. That is successful, 18. Eight damage on first one. Second one, that was cocked. One more time, same attack, 19, with another four, that's eight damage. Then I'm going to just do one more with my offhand, I'm going to try and break his nose because that feels personal. 16? And that's seven damage. That's it. Keg! Keg! That was so almost awesome! Beau is going to immediately run over here to this undiscovered prison ballsack region. They're all unconscious? I think we're all still The Mighty Nein. [cheering] Shakäste, did you say something about making all this better than what it was? Yeah. We still haven't found your partner. He's not here yet, right? Let's open the other cage. What are you going to do? Are you going to keep looking? At least for a drunken bender. Tonight, you want to stay with me? [cheering] What was it Shakäste just said? Get yourself something nice?
