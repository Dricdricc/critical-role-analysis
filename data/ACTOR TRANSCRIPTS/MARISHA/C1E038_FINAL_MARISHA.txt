She'll have another one. Dick. Not you. Yes. Valentine's Day weekend. I'm so excited. No! I'm so excited. Oh man. Cliff divers. So stylish. That's Travis's! And we're still supporting 826LA, so you can still donate. It's still there, you can still do it. SAM and Fucking with my clique. He's in the alley. It's amazing because you can like hear her footsteps. It's like a cartoon. It's totally like a Pixar intro. No one help her. This was the best opening of our show. We should've played our theme music over that. (laughter) But don't tell him! It's a surprise. It's a present. And we really want to see his face when he opens it. That's the best part of giving a gift. So when you say you are his blood you actually mean more literally for once? Is that what I'm getting? Yeah, and are you going to wake up like a baby so we have like 20 years before we have to worry about you again? Have we tried to Restoration him first? She didn't do it yet, right? Yeah. A holy dick. We did. We already got the skull with the missing eye. What time is it? Yeah! Yeah, but that was work. Were we supposed to be pretend-- yeah, sure. Let's go to old faithful. Where's old faithful? Find a new place? Pub crawl! I mean, it's technically our town. We should get to know our city, you guys. Like H-O-A-- Like Woolworth's, but Halworth's? No! Guys. The evening is our-- what do they say about things like that? The evening is our oyster. Right? Isn't that what they say? What? Oh, thank you, Pike. Let's stay out all night. Come on. We can see the sunrise. We never do this. We never take time for ourselves. I have. Come on, you guys. Yes! Guys, there's got to be like some street vendors. Come on. We have servants. It's fine. Gilmore! Gilmore! Gilmore. What are you drinking? We're buying. What are you drinking? These things are not cheap. They're even changing the name, they're making it more hip, it's going to be called WhiSto now. It's great. Just shortening it. This is great. Look, it's been fermenting for a while. And Keyleth gets up and moves and sits next to Vax. What? Noooo. You say that now, and then tomorrow some crazy person will show up at our door and want us to do something crazy and then we'll never have a free night again. What? Let's do it! Gilmore, I love you too! She said two shots. She wants two shots. She wants two shots, and so wait, are me and you doing the two and the-- Quadruple? (laughs) Don't want it anyway. Oh, that's not good. Eight. Total. I got to go outside. I got to go outside. I got to-- no, no, no, no. Pike, tell me a story! Well, I figured we were just outside the door. No, that one cursed me before. That one was bad. Let's do this one. Oh, that's better. That's better. 18. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Grog said it would make me stay up. Why does my mouth keep producing saliva? Pike, Pike, I missed you so much. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm so sorry. Holy shit. What kind of shots did you give me, Grog? (groans) Why would you ask that question? My body absorbed the process and the calories. I made it outside. The party keeps going! Cordell! Cordell, open another bottle! God damn it, Cordell, we pay you! Oh, good. Cordell! Cordell, I'm sorry. You opened wine, and I yelled at you. I'm sorry. Oh, I figured Cordell walked us in. Thanks, Cordell! Thank you! I'm still drunk. No! Oh. Yeah, we found the lair. Oh, are we talking about General Krieg? He was so dreamy! Oh, you know Krieg? Yeah, more wine! How long are you guys staying? (slurred) Good night, Percy. (laughing) Wait-- (wheezing) Cliffs of Dagger Bay! Go ahead! Yeah? (laughter) Oh my god! Is there a manipulation check? A bard. So good! You. Have we all come downstairs or are we all sitting around-- No, I don't think she did. (laughter) You scared another one away? Oh, Scanlan. I kind of liked her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Actually, what happened? Pike, what happened? Grog. That sounds like something I'd do. Wait, we did what? No, what was the second word you said? The third word you said? That one. Well, what, what? Whose house? Wait! Yeah, the dragon that we provoked. So, you know. What do you all want in the house? What do you all want in the house? This sounds like nothing we would ever agree to. Ever. We would never agree to investigate a house with nothing. So we're now going to go into a house with bad things coming out of it. And we don't know what these bad things are. What did we agree to, Percy? Percy, what did we agree to? Percy, tell me. No. Maybe. I'm not going to go stealing from some house-- -- when you guys aren't even giving me all the information. Well, maybe if I didn't have friends who were such douchebags. I didn't even get to see the sunrise. No! Percy. Pike! Vex. I don't even know what we're doing. Trinket is a bear. Okay. Let's go. We're keeping things safe. Vox Machina. Woo, let's go. I agree. But the guards have the ability to call higher authority on us and we don't want people-- Why don't we at least do a little bit of pre-planning? Do we need like a warrant for something like this? I stand next to Vex, irritated. Wardrobe racks? You know, I could Skywrite that we're here in the sky again. She's going to literally try picking the lock? Yes! It happens to everybody. That's a panty-dropper, as Sam would say. Have we all entered? Oh god, this isn't helping with the hangover. Can I Druidcraft the table and take like the decaying food and maybe, I don't know, grow some flowers out of it, try to make it look nice? Try and compost it, yeah? It's like a big old terrarium now Split the party! Is there a downstairs? Like a cellar? That's from the Heroes' Feast? Let me remember them all. I'll stay on the middle floor. I'll be team middle floor. So we're all still there, we can see him? Hang on, hang on. Let's just leave him for a minute. Let's just leave him. Can we leave him? I can fix this. I could fix it, (whispers) but why don't we leave him? Oh, I feel a little bad. I'll let him out. Dispel Magic. I did today. It was kind of fun to watch, I'm not going to lie. I rolled 14. Are there any further signs like the feast of people leaving in a hurry? That seems like someone was here and left really fast? A suitcase, or--? Can I Detect Magic on any of them? No. I wanted to arcane it. I'm not good at it. Yeah, still really hungover. 14. I say yeah. I guess me. Is that the same one that was here last time? 20. Yeah. I feel like we might've-- I feel like that's not also the first time we've heard of Ank'Harel. I feel like even before then, like a long time ago. Marquet is the continent? Correct? And Ank'Harel is a city within the continent. It's like a desert continent? The whole continent is like desert? So it's like Australia? Which one? I'm going to help Percy examine the skull. Yeah, can I do a nature check to see if I can recognize what kind of skull it might be? 17. What? It's the left eye. He said it's in its right eye. Yeah, we've already done this once, you guys, let's not be crazy. So wait, wait. There's the, there's still the tapestry in front of it? Can I take the tapestry off? The wall? I want to like take it and put it over my shoulders and jump a little. Yeah. See if-- Yeah. I just thought I'd try. Okay, I take the tapestry and I put it over the skull. Oh boy. You have advantage. No, wait, that's saving throws. Never mind. He remembers. Can I assist Grog in finding if our footsteps were the last ones out? Well, let's think of what happened last time we were here. There was a bunch of gold and there were three eyes in a wall-- LAURA and We did crack one of them. One cracked. But, wait weren't the-- These aren't the same gems that were holding Uriel's family, those were different. That's right, it was in the mountain cave. I might be able to. Well if I recall, it wasn't too far from Stillben right? Because Keyleth recognized it as her home mountains? Like two hours? Natural 20. Can I do a nature check? Yeah, don't those fuckers do that type of shit? 20 total. No scratch marks, claw marks? Almost seems mechanical type of-- magical? How can you tell? That wasn't there before? Or was that one there before? Roll good. Would they be capable of making the smooth tunnels? Yeah, and remember last time we did this? I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm with Scanlan. Because they said he was an older art collector, gray-haired man, right? I can maybe do that. I'll light up my fire hands and start melting, just his face. Thawing. I can Move Earth and we can move around earth. Can everyone feel it? Nature check? 19. (shouting) Earthquake! Get to the archways! (quieter) Find a bathroom. Because Pike and I are by the dead guy, right? I take Pike and back her behind the dead guy, and we're hiding. We've fought one of these before, right? Yay! Don't! Don't do it. They're too nice. Man, Matt knows us really well. We walk into every fucking everything.
