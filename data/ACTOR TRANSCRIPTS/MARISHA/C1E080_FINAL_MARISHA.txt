Happiness! Oprah. Yay for Spanish Two! I don't know-- - Jesus Christ. - Yeah, police. That's awesome. ♪ Spider Percy, Spider Percy ♪♪ Oh, boy. - This is great. Twenty total. - Yeah! - I mean, I'm not, you know. - Taking it for granted. (talking over each other) Yeah, yeah, something like that. Or five, it's debatable. Depends on the health of the people. The air ate her. Dude. Whereabouts was she last? But we can assume she probably went invisible and then moved. I could do Faerie Fire on her, but I mean, I don't know where she is and it's a 20 foot cube. It'd probably be a waste. So, instead, I'm going to cast Call Lightning at fourth level, and go fire elemental. Yeah, it's a concentration. Yeah, I can make it-- I'm going to take a few steps back and-- question. Can I look up and see if, like, the clouds are kind of shaping around like a, you know, roughly dragon shaped body? That make sense? You gave me that "this is bullshit" look. Oh, that's not bad. With perception, perception. Sorry, I'm so nervous, 26. Yeah, so it's fine. So, I'll take a few steps back. Yeah, oh, oh. It's totally mirrored. - It's fine. It's not a problem. I'm sorry, so move me-- - Yeah, down-- down. Right there, down one more. -Other way. - South. Yeah, that's good, that's-- that's good. - It's like inverted controls. Yes. And-- - Yeah, what's-- That's true. But that was from the lair action. Yeah, but does she care or even not care? This is turning into a Jerry Springer episode. Is she or is she not the mom? It's like riding a bike, riding a bike. You want to try and Daenerys this shit? We each get one, you guys. Battleship. - I was just gonna say, is she Yoda-ing you? Is it like a Yoda situation, that's awesome. One of the best things they've done in a while. Fuck, is that her? I don't like any of it. And like, it's got antlers, and I'm like... (grunts) Really? Even with Hero's Feast? - Oh, shit. Are you being facetious? Okay. Really unsure of what's going on, so I'm just going to... Thank you. I'm gonna go to that egg right here that Vax was wailing on. - And try and finish it off. I'm gonna do two slam attacks. - Multi attack. Uh, wait. Those were both nine's. Which is-- so 15 total. -To hit? - Okay, and that is-- I am totally punching a dragon-- Plus six, so that's a ten. Fourteen, eighteen damage. Okay, that's my turn. - Those were both-- those my attacks. I rolled two nine's and I have a plus six. - I rolled both of 'em twice. Yes. - Eighteen. - Yes. - He made them clones. How many are there? Wait, are we sure there was nothing in it? Do you want to go check and see if there was something in it? Are there five-- there are five eggs? They're little clones? Yeah, only one way to find out. -Let's bust open another one. - Is it alive or did I kind of kill it by-- "I did it! I got one!" I do, don't I. I want to start heading towards Vax. Fifty feet. - And I'm, like, hovering. It's like a spa. - It's like a hot spring. You should ask Sam. Yeah, there you go. So, both the twins have no turns. Is there anything that could help with the stuff that has been magically cast on us? Here, guys. Laser pointer. What did that do, oh, that was-- She got counter spelled. They're in the walls. The goddamn walls. Oh, yay. That's better, that's good. Good job. Good job. - Uh-huh. That's cool. It's like an Easter egg hunt. Oh, man. ♪ Hey! Oh! Adele Dazeem's-- Jesus, that was an eighth level necromancy spell. And where is she, she still on the ceiling? Okay. I can still see her a little bit. Okay, so since she's in my cloud, I'm going to kind of like, do one of those sideways arcing lightning strikes. Just... and arc everything right towards that bitch. She just takes damage, right? Twenty. - Yes! - Yes, it is! - Yep, yep! 4d10. -Okay, I rolled that. - I rolled okay. I actually rolled-- did roll real well. You're right, I rolled well. Nine, nine, 18. Plus eight, that is 26 damage. I still have movement, right? I am going to head towards the egg that got cracked open that's in the center there. Yeah. - Can I do a bonus action to like, examine? Okay, I'll do just a perception check right now. Twenty-three. And no sign of a-- And no sign of a dragon baby? Alright. Flattened, yeah, that's my turn. Oh, that's funny. Come on. Dragon delicacy. I don't know. Kima! - Benefit of the doubt. Is it Healing Word? It does an additional d4. Right? No, sorry, just one d4. Double dig! - How could you forget? It's like all I've thought about. Ashley is almost-- - Hey! (applause, laughing) Oh! ♪ Hoo! ♪ ♪ Woo! ♪♪ She can drink next year. Amazing. - Lot of LA things right back to back. -It's overwhelming. - Oh, that's good. That's good. Oh, boy. Oh my God, please don't land in the lava. Totally. Poor Kima! - Okay, so Keyleth, pretty pissed off from seeing her boyfriend spiked from the sky. I'm going to kinda get a few, well, no, I guess I can stay here. Kind of above the lava create a swirling angry lava vortex of lightning and fire and I'm gonna hit her again with lightning. Yeah, she saved. Okay, not too bad. Twelve, 14 plus seven, 21 total. Half damage. Not great. Um... No, I can't do anything. Does-- does Vax look like he's about to fall in the lava? Do you have flame resistance right now? Yeah, you said you're flame resistant. Okay, so I'm gonna use my movement then. I'm gonna be very careful to make sure I touch the armor, the Raven Queen armor and I'm going to see if I can just fire elemental like roll him away from the edge a little bit. It's been nice. (talking over each other) But he has fire resistance. We're cool, we're good. That would be the most Keyleth thing to do. I love you so-- oh God, I killed the thing I love. I'm sorry, George. I'm gonna then take a few steps back away from him now. Yeah, yes. Yeah. - Come on, Scanlan. Like the most fucked up Care Bear stare. Yeah. - Each color is like bad. Whoo! - But how? - She's 22. - He's standing. Yeah, yeah, just attach it to a string. Go on, girl! Just a-- a nice southern California day. Yes. Like, chess. Bitch cares. - She cares! Google Donkey Kong. Yeah, yeah. (indistinct talking) How many? - I'm wondering if I should drop this and start doing beefier stuff now. I think now's the time. Okay, I am going to move from-- Over the lava like this direction. Geez, I can't tell. - This way, this way. See the laser pointer? No, no, no, I had it. I had it and it went away. -Okay. - No, it's-- yeah, over there. - Uh-huh. And how far away is Raishan from me now? Okay, move me like one more closer to her. And how close am I from the twins now? I can't see. Okay, let me move five more feet so I can be within 30 feet of the twins. Okay, now I'm gonna drop my-- Drop my form. - I hope this is not a terrible idea. - We're at that point. This is Dungeons and Dragons! I'm going to bust out the Spire of Conflux. So I'm gonna bust out the staff and be like, "You bitch." And then aim it. I'm gonna do chain lightning and can I try and hit her and the two eggs and maybe like, since I still have the storm going, like, it just looks cool? (laughing) I have to choose to make an action. It's still there, but I can either like do other things or choose to do-- Sorry, I don't do the-- 10d8. I have one, two, three, four, five... I think I'm good, I'll just roll five twice. Oh, God, oh, God. Did she save? But the eggs didn't? Okay, that's not phenomenal. Three, six, nine, ten-- nine, ten, eleven. Plus four is 15 plus... Okay, okay. What'd I say, 15? Twenty-five, 29. Thirty-six total. Oh! Oh, and I get to reroll this one. Thirty-six, no, thirty-eight. It didn't do anything to 'em? Nothing I can see. Maybe I like microwaved 'em inside. Like nuked 'em. Might have nuked 'em. Yeah, or I turned 'em into little Vision dragons. You know, one of the two. Okay, and then for my bonus action, I'm going to do a Healing Word on Vax. I'm just gonna do it at first level. -Sorry. - Three plus (indistinguishable) so nine total. The eggs? As a bonus action, so can she heal someone else? Does she happen to do-- that's a bonus action. Can she do it twice? Kaiju battle! Come on, man. - Come on! - She was not unconscious, she was up. How much time does Revivify need? She's dead. She's gonna do Revivify. - Yeah, she did lay out less than six seconds, man. No one else die. Yeah, but it's on her, right? Yeah, I see what you mean though. I wonder how bad Raishan is looking. She's burned through all of her legendary resistance? Pretty stupid. Fuck. - So not good. Fuck. Jesus. That'll be a later question? Does that grapple? - She'd have to do a concentration check, right? Should've done that, should've done it. Okay, she has 120 foot-- or she just went 160 feet? Is she-- ♪ But she wasn't-- Fuck me, oh my God, okay. Can I still see her through the tunnel? It's a range thing. I mean, could I try and-- fuck. -This is really bad. - She's so far away, dude. 'Cause my-- my question is-- She didn't necessarily-- 'Cause could I try and move up and then do a long range Wall of Stone spell? To try and collapse the tunnel before she gets out? It's 120 foot. No, I mean, I can't-- I mean, I could get us out again, but-- I know. Okay, wow. This is really bad. Okay, I will use... Who's-- yeah, who's really close? Who's like one away? Who's like really bad? - Yeah. Okay, it doesn't matter. Can I kinda jump and make my way over like, this kind of... This-- can I cross this tinier lava right there? Kind of like, or is that a pretty far jump? How far of a jump is that? Sure, why not? Why not at this point? Well, that was a natural one. Just trying to jump across what should have been literally anything else. 60. - A fucking dumbass, yeah! Can I get out now? I'm trying to use my movement or am I gonna die if I get out? Can I get out? I was like, as long as I don't roll a one, that shouldn't be that hard-- okay. Okay, I'm out of the flame. And I reach over as a bonus action and do a Healing Word to-- to Vax. I don't know. Level one. Oh, that's good, that's four so, nine points. No, I'm sorry ten points, that's ten points. - Can I turn to J'Mon? Say, "J'Mon, can you sense her presence? She's a fellow dragon. Do you know where she might be going or what she might be doing?" Really? - Well, yes, do that, do that really quick! Do it, do it, do it. Oh my God, I could-- Oh my God, I could! Even with the Sprinter's Boots? We're still going in order? I have a crazy plan. You only have to cast the Mansion Door within line of sight, correct? Okay. Okay, two things. One, before we start burning our seventh level spells, I still have Stone Shape. Can Keyleth go up to the wall and do I have enough-- is there just enough room in the corridor walls that I could Stone Shape-- Can I Stone Shape a tunnel kind of around the thing? Or is-- Okay. Can I Stone Shape a little passage around? Do I have just enough kinda to where I can-- where the barrier is I can kind of carve a little corridor around? Okay. Eight. I'm-- might as well give it a shot, I mean-- Talking to Thordak! Okay, I'm gonna Stone Shape and try and just cast a little, even if it's a corridor just right around. Okay. - I'm go ahead and can I use a bonus action. I'm gonna use my-- no, no, no, I'm gonna just drink a healing potion real quick. Just one of my Greaters. I'm not feeling very confident right now. I'm trying to Stone Shape a corridor through this, but I don't know if it's going to be enough to get through the thickness. - Egg doesn't know what's coming. They got the key card. Shut up! - Or by-- it's like he said. We cover ourselves in dragon goo and then we can walk through. We didn't destroy all the eggs, right? So, do it. It's hard to say. Yeah, I was gonna say, "somewhere"? Me. - Kind of. Well, we're not all dead. We just can't die anymore. It's the eggs, it was the eggs. Hang on, hang on. I'm feeling very guilty because it was my rage and anger and want for vengeance which made me run in here blindly towards her, maybe we shouldn't do it again is all I'm saying. Okay. Avengers Run down the hall. There's no Thordak's corpse? - Or she raised him. Jesus. What? - Vex, can you sense dragons anywhere nearby? That was really scary. Yeah. It's a spray. Yeah, all magazines. We will sign them. That sucked. I was about to lay some serious damage when she ran away. I was gonna bust out a seventh level blight and then she ran. Yeah, and he didn't fucking recharge it. Happy New Year. Yeah. -
