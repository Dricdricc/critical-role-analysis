So many things. They're mad, you're allowed. It's good. Go download Spotify right now, so you can go, if you haven't. It's free! It has. It's been a long day. And keychains. There's a new shirt up. I didn't know that. Where'd Liam go? Holy shit. But we have Spotify lists to replace them. So there's still more content. Yeah. Yes. 826LA, they're in a campaign right now for-- let me try to get all this right-- for LA 2050 which is a big contest that's sponsored by Goldhirsh, right now, and it's all for sponsoring education and a brighter future for Los Angeles. So 826LA and Young Storytellers are actually partnering together, and they're in this contest right now. You have to go vote, and they could potentially win $100,000. Which awesome. And we've got Critters. I think they'll win. So you have to go vote. I tweeted the link, so the mods, go find it on my twitter, or you can just search #LA2050, and you should be able to find it. So, yeah, go vote. Also, they just announced they're going to be opening an 826LA-- sorry, not 826LA, but an 826 in San Francisco! Oh, is there another, I guess so. They might be opening a second one. I think they said they announced they're opening one. I think. Okay. Taliesin's retweeting me. But, go vote. Help them win 100k. Yeah, it's like about a g*psy girl, and it's got a bunch of recipes, and it teaches you how to make a bow, and has herb cards and all sorts of cool stuff. I was into it immediately. Zartana. And last, but not least, last Thursday while we were here, looking at dead versions of ourselves hanging from a tree, Super Power Beat Down won a Geekie! Yeah, glad I came here instead of going to the award show. Totally worth it. But we won a Geekie. So, I thought I should say that. Thanks. Just, once again, like, it-- No. Can I do a few checks while I'm preparing the ritual to see if this is a curse over this tree? Not great. Hang on, my ring of protection is in the way. Nine. God, I hope this works. I don't really know. I don't know if this is going to work, to be totally honest. The tree is dead. Do you have any of that holy water? Do I have holy water? I don't know if I took one or not. I can't remember. I'm pretty good about that. I don't think I took one. Okay. Yeah, let's get some water. Yeah, we cannot let that go. Remember, we also have Heroes' Feast up. Advantages on wisdom throws and whatnot. Yeah. 2d10 hit points. Max hit points. I'm going to start-- I've kind of cleared out around the roots. Yeah. Can I start carving a little ravine around it for where we're going to start pouring the water? Damage anything. I'm doing what I do best. And I focus all my energy on this thing. Utterly pickable! It's the most pickable lock I've ever seen! It's not even locked. It's just heavy. It's just a door, you guys! It's just a door. Man, Laura and Travis ain't missing shit! (whispering) Paper. Finish. First. He does have a pile of maps over there. MATT Shh! Don't look at it. I'm just noting the pile. Dope. You finally got a good initiative roll! You have advantage! You're welcome. Just for a refresher you're immune to poison, disease, and fear, and you have advantage on your wisdom throws. It's expensive. Wait, don't forget you have the additional-- 2d10 hit points on top. That's a good sign. Get the fuck out. Well, get him up. That's good! Yay! Percy's unconscious! It's okay, it's cool. Do it. I think it's plus your spell level. Thank god. You killed it. de Rolos are back! Six hours later... I have a question. MATT Yes. The sun has come out during the daytime? Does it seem to be fairly natural weather for this time of year? Okay. Yeah? Can I do something? Something real quick for my final, extra drama? So, as I complete the ritual, remembering that Pelor, and this is a sun tree. I'm going to cast my 6th-level Sunbeam spell as I'm finishing the Plant Growth with the last big essence-- I'm underground. So, I'm going to take my Sunbeam, and wrap it up with my druid goodness. And shove it in the tree. Yeah, I'm going to kill it. I don't know if it's going to work or not. Do I get advantage on this? Because of Heroes' Feast? I hope I didn't just fuck up by doing this. I'm so nervous. But my wisdom's not bad, so 12? Oh, cool. That's cool. Cool story. I'll put it out. Oh my god. Ooh! Like starting a fire. (blows air) Go, go! Can I Druidcraft? Come on! I take some of that holy oil that Vax gave me and I dip my finger in it and start rubbing it along the vines that are growing along the edge of the roots. The ground is cursed. Perception check? No, I'm good at perceiving things, I'm just not good at reading people. That's not bad. 23? I was going to say, can I still see the green being sucked down a bit? I'm exhausted. SAM and I'm sorry I couldn't fix the tree, you guys. Thanks. I was afraid I was going to permanently kill it for a second. What do we have to do first? 2PM tomorrow. 25. Oh no! What the fuck?! Get yourself a double cheeseburger. You feeling okay? It was cold. Did you catch a cold? Is your throat ticklish? Do you want some Goodberries? It might help a little bit-- What? All right. If you suck on them a little bit they act like "logenzes." Well, shut up. LIAM, SAM, and What time is it? Until 2PM, yo! Oh, never mind. Is there a mailbox with a name? (laughter) Is that actually what you're saying? It's kind of like the game show problem. Do you have a fever? Is he running a fever? Ew. Do we want to sneak in, though? You're the only one who knows what they look like. Okay, wait. Are the gates locked? You said there was 40? Four. Right. So wait, which mansion were we at? SAM and Which mansion is that out of the three? That's the northeastern one? She's the doctor, right? Well, okay. I'm mean, yeah. He's going to feel it once I cast it on him, but I can try. I don't know if my-- I don't know if Greater Restoration will work. What makes you think they're going to hide us? Percy? I don't mean to beat a dead horse or anything, but-- No. You're sure about all of this? Well, that I'm fine with. No, not that I'm fine with. I mean, I'm fine helping prevent that. I'm just more worried about your sanity than anything else. Okay. You followed me into the fiery abyss, so-- Touch√©. I'll follow you, though. I'll follow you to the end. I go puddle hopping! Oh. I look miserable. Sir North Korean. It is raining. It's dark. It's raining. Does it look like it's going to pass soon? 21. Like candlelight? Is there any sign of windows that are blacked out? Are we going through the cellar? We're between a fence, right? There are guards? LAURA and Is it poky up top? Want me to heat up that metal bar for you? The bar that he's-- -- Lou Ferrigno-ing, I'm going to cast Heat Metal. Put on some gloves. Spit in your hand a little bit. Grip and bear it. You can use your axe. You do you! You do you, Grog. I go ahead and I cast Healing Word on his hands. Ooh! 11. 34. Do your thing. I'll go ahead and use my flaming hands. Wait, hang on! Grog just said wait! Last time we did that, it went really well. Wait, are you going in? Are you infiltrating? I touch Vax's shoulder and I cast Enhance Ability and I'm going to give you dex saves-- what do you want? What do you want advantage on? All right. Constitution. Enhance Ability. So I think it's called Bear's Constitution or something weird. Checks. Okay. Do you want dex or anything? Instead, I say, good luck. Who leaves that much in their coat pockets? This is about to be hilarious! Places everyone, places! That's good! 32. Oh, we're opening the door? A music room! How regal! I look back at Vex and I just go-- It's the mom slap, exactly! It's the grandma backhand. Oh my god. Someone say something cool! Of course. Damn guards. That's right! 13. Bitches gonna die! Percy! You got it. Is that also a guard? There are three guards? Cool. I'm also probably going to do a ranged spell. What kind of armor is Sir Kerrion wearing? Studded leather? Okay. Okay, I'm going to cast Call Lightning. And I'm going to bring down a bolt. Here we go. This way. Right in between Sir Kerrion and this guard so they both have to save from it. Yeah! Oh, so it's going to-- The room won't fit my storm cloud? Pooper muffin. Okay. Well, then. Yeah, go Vax. 66?! He draws two rapiers? Do we get any indication by what we just saw if he might be a vampire or something? I can make an insight check? Ooh, yeah! 27. Yeah, he has aged. All right, I'm going to do some fun shit. So seeing Vax go up and get next to Lord Kerrion or whatever the shit his name is. I'm going to go and turn into a dire wolf this time. Mixing it up from Minxie. But slightly bigger. But dire. It's white, a wintery wolf from the mountains that I'm from. I'm going to rush and use my pack tactics and flank Lord Kerrion. Oh, from a random shithead? Yeah, let's do it. 50 feet. Is that flanking? I know, that's what I was trying to get. All right. Well, then, since Vax has that guy, I'll go for this guy. Take him out. Okay. Ooh, that was a 19 to hit. Okay, 2d6 plus three. That's not great, four, five, six, seven, eight piercing damage, and then do I also-- oh, and he has to make a DC 13 strength saving throw or be knocked prone. (cheers) So he's down. Not a lot. What did I say, six? Yes. Do I get my fiery stuff for that? Bite. Okay. Okay, he's down. Yep. Nice. Kill him! Yeah! Do you crit on a 19? Fuck! We all see this? I'm not crazy! No, and I'm at this guy's throat. Yeah, it did! I can see it from here! Yeah it is! That's pretty "grood." He thinks it's Ripley. He thinks it's Ripley with the gun! Ripley's building guns! Fucking Ripley! Wait, who's doing what? Kerrion's healing? Is it a regeneration thing or is he casting a spell? Wait, he's calling in backup? Shit. Oh, he's going to Dimension Door out. 22. 21! Looking up and noticing that Sir Kerrion is gone and Vax is blindly stabbing into the distance, I'm going to drop my wolf form and cast Faerie Fire in that radius. 20-foot cube. Right here. Realizing my party members are clearly stabbing at something. I'll back up a tidbit. Just back up a smidge. Yeah, sure, whatever. I can see him now. Faerie Fire always makes it weird. Miss. You've got the amulet on. Is that the guy who you charmed? Awesome. Go Percy, go Percy, go! That was with advantage? Pooper. Percy rolls! This against Kerrion, right? Could you do it now, for flavor? Not 100% sure what's going on. Can I take my Faerie Fire concentration that I still have up and move it over top of the black smoke figure? I don't know; can I move a Faerie Fire? 20 feet; is he in it, perchance? Never mind. Natural 20. No, it's with my staff, I'm assuming, right? Unless I wanted to deck him in the face. This is with my staff, okay. So it's five, so that's 11. I don't attack a lot. 13 damage. Yeah. I just clothesline him. I see him running, I'm like (grunts). Someone write that down. What about the dominated guy? He's about to save from it. Domination, he can save from it at any second. Vouk? Okay, but what are we going to do about dominated guy? Can we tie him up, too? He could save from that any second. We need to like off him or something. Just knock him out. Knowing what's coming, I'm going to Druidcraft some pretty kaleidoscope-y flowers in front of his face. Pretty image before you die. While all this happens, I'm going over to baldy. Lord Vouk or Mister Vouk and pop a Cure Wounds potion into him. How far down is he? He was just at zero. I brought him to zero. Yeah. All right, I'll pop a Cure Wounds into him. I was giving him pretty flowers. I gave him pretty flowers to look at. I Druidcrafted from a distance. I drop 18 points of healing into Vouk. Stuff doesn't grow, though. Not like it should. What did they do to the land? And what exactly are they doing under the castle? She's the one who made them? Natural 20?! Whoa! You would, though. You would. Have we also forgotten that this entire town is looking for us? They will after we set fire on the house and send a man screaming through the street with your symbol on his forehead. They will! They're going to go, "Hm, let's look at the burning smokestack of a house "and start there." (voice cracking) Yeah, but-- yeah. Hang on. Fellow half-elves, you look as horrified as I feel. What do you guys think? Look, I agreed to start a rebellion and let the people have their uprising, but I'm with Vax. I was trying to tell you this before we even came here, Percy. You don't want to become the thing that you are so desperate to seek vengeance on. How are we any different than the Briarwoods, at this point? Why are things more complicated, Percy? Clearly, we all just witnessed what just happened. Yeah, no, I'd agree with that, yeah. Let's get out of here. All right, we're setting this damn house on fire? I'm going to say All right. Well, if we're going to light this damn house on fire and make it a symbol-- We're at least going to make it cool and make it the message that it's supposed to be. I turn into an eagle and I fly to the roof. Give me your symbol. I cast Flaming Sphere. Yeah. Hope you guys were ready to get out. I cast Flaming Sphere, and I start moving it around on the roof and start drawing the shape of the de Rolo family crest on the roof. And I take my Flaming Sphere, and I throw it right at the feet of where the guards are. I run over to the edge where the cellar was, and I go, (whispering) Grog. Grog! (whispering) Come to the side of the roof! (whispering) Grog! Hey! (whispering) Catch me! Get the fuck out of here. I was going to say, do you have Pass Without a Trace, can you summon any more spells? Yeah, before we move. 25. Speaking of Percy and his crazy storyline-- I'm guessing by now if you go on the Geek and Sundry website, you can find his playlist. I was gonna say, music to murder to. Go check it out, it's great. Taliesin art. Or burning on rooftops. Glad I'm not the only one who thinks you're crazy anymore. You're all crazy, we've all seen it. Now we can handle it as a family. But in the meantime, don't forget to go to LA2050 and vote for 826LA so they can win 100k. I was gonna suggest-- we had the Hunger Games reference, so what was his name? Kerrion or whatever? The Gamemaster in the first one?
