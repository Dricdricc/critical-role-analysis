Word. That's what she said. Do they just assume your character doesn't go to the salon and cut your hair? Is that not a thing? Did we fight? Oh, no, that's right, we went down going through. I'm assuming it's going to take us some time just to even get there, though, right? Sure. Do we still have Pass Without a Trace? Yeah, let's at least move for 30 more minutes. Are me and you in robes? You lead with the censer. (chanting) With advantage? 17. Like parting for the queen at the Ren Faire? Or Taliesin Jaffe at any party. I could tell by his Cheers shirt. (laughing) Yeah, I do a little Gust cantrip and put a little of the censer smoke under the door. I'm like an oscillating fan. Yes, I do. That's exactly what I was going to do. Is it anything like we've ever heard about? Do we still have... 36. Sure. Can I tell what the herbs are? Thank you. Is this something that I would get advantage on for my herb book? 28. I did! I write it down and I press a flower, or I save some of it. And then can I Druidcraft some more, now that I know what it is? Okay, I'll go ahead and make as much as I can. Okay. I take half, put half back in the censer, and give half to Percy. Does anybody else want some? Actually, should we dab ourselves with it? No, is that weird? Give some to Percy, anybody else want some? How thick does it appear to be? Or through it. 17. Go to the gate? Okay. I'll see if I can discern something here a little bit better. You go. Go check it out. I ask them, how thick does the wall appear to be around that side? I can try and Stone Shape through it. Oh, weird. Oh no. What if we dismantle the gems? Didn't we take some of that crystal? Didn't we take some of that? Didn't we take shards of it from the thresholds in Syngorn? One of them shattered, and I feel like we took some. I don't know, maybe it's useful in this case? Where was the gem embedded in the doorway? Is it unworked stone? What's the ground like? I could attempt to tunnel us there. Percy, I'm sure you would know more than anyone. What's the likelihood that we might encounter, that I might bust through a dungeon or something, though, over there? I can get us under the wall for sure. I can do both, it's just figuring out what we want to do. Okay. Can I Stone Shape-- -- a crawlspace through the wall? Big enough for at least Grog to marine belly through? But I can't carve a shape through the wall to just crawl through, five feet? Yeah, through the wall, not under the ground. I want to bust a crawl space through the bottom of the wall. It's not a dynamite blast, it's like a (rumble). Yeah, it's like butter. So... Cover for me. What? Okay. Seemingly to no negative effect, I've made a tunnel. I'm whispering! I'm just trying to be more pragmatic. No, we didn't. Keeping track. Why is he keeping track? I'll wait and see everyone else through, just in case. I'm going to try and keep a lookout. It's not coming up? Oh, god, am I trying to do anything but get through? I don't know, I've got to crawl through! Yeah! Thank you! Thank you! I'm going to see it and immediately Beast Shape into a little mouse and (crawling sounds) through. 18. Yeah. Immediately poof. I'm assuming no more than a kitten's worth. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool story. Cool. (wheezing) You could have told it gently! Five points? (wheezing) I made it, guys! I'm glad you made it! Yeah, call them off! Tell them it's handled, we're dead. Where's the nearest 7-11? Thanks, Scanlan! Mr. Mistoffelees! (whispered) What's around us right now? (regular volume) Sorry, what's around us right now? Do we really not want to do any other healing? Might still be useful. I feel like we're going to have to do a lot of things to stop this. What if it has to keep expanding all the way to the crystals? I thought he blinked before. Are we at an hour and 15 minutes? A wink? Man, semantics! Why? You're trying to bail, aren't you? Were you trying to run? Is there a water bucket around? 11. I take a little bit of the water and control it and let Pike wash off a little bit. Or he was trying to bail before the final part of the ritual. He had rations! No one takes rations! What if the giant orb has to reach the crystals? Yeah, the (buzzing, exploding). I'm a little rough. Nice. We're taking a break? We would. 30. I join Vex. I look around. Are we still in the Shadowfell? That's not great. 18. Oh my god. I mean, maybe we should return to something like sabotaging the machine, or... burning the city. Oh god, Vex is rubbing off on me. Agreed. How far did the blast go that you saw? I believe me and Pike both do, yes. Between me, you, and Pike? We can take this tower down. Hang on, 180 feet in diameter? Hang on. Pike and I check our spellbooks real quick. For up to a minute and a hundred foot radius, centered at a point... But, I mean, two Earthquake spells and Grog. I will point out this will be burning mine and Pike's 8th-level spell, but it might be worth it. I can tunnel out underneath it. How far are we from the tower in this little house? You guys could do the Feast and some of us can help tunnel out the ground during that hour. So we're going to try to fly up? I have a feeling we're going to be down here a while. Keyleth looks out the window again. Are people panicked, are people running around? Is there a rabble in the street? Oh, that's good! 30! Man, you're frosty today. You're just-- Well, how are we going to go in, though? Just flying up? And then what? And then what, though? Once we get there? Play it by ear? I can't. I gave Vax Foresight. I cannot turn into a beholder today. Do you have Shapechange? I'm honestly still kind of into the earthquake idea. Bringing down the tower. I'm not going to lie. How do you know? No, no, no. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in your area when you cast the spell, and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, and the spell lasts a minute. Ten of those. Ten 50s. With Pike and I. It's concentration for up to a minute, and it has a 500-foot range, and a 100-foot radius. So Pike and I could split, half and half of the tower. I feel like if we go right up to the top of the tower, it's like walking into the danger. This is insane! Well, how do you mean? It's my concentration, so I can keep it going and do an instant reaction spell. I mean, I can throw a Fireball and keep it going, yeah. God, I hope this works. I don't know if this is going to work! Grog, can you at the right moment just do a big-- see if you can topple it over? I know! Matt's stone cold! And if we can be hidden while we're doing this, instead of being open. We have a 500-foot range here. We've got a dope-ass range. How many robes did we swipe? Totally 'Little Rascals' it! Oh, I love it! That's a vestige right there! Be cool. Be cool. You need to get your eyes checked, then. Your depth perception may be off. Hoods forward. Just nod and smile. I'm really bad at holding my eye shut for this long. We only need to be so far out. Like the Fourth of fucking July. It's totally taken us to Whitestone. 19. Pike and I huddle together and try and join forces. Let's do it. People don't tell us to stop if they're not afraid of what we're doing. I love you all. We do it, above the screaming, howling Horror Nights sound effects. It kind of worked. It brought it down. Did anyone of significance die in the process? I can Plane Shift us if things get really bad, but I kind of think we're already on our plane. To the top of the tower? Can I hop on a carpet or broom? I'll hop on the broom with Vex. Beholder has the anti-magic cone eye situation. Just wait and see. How long does it last to cast? That's fine. Yeah, I follow your lead. It's true! But not today. Hey, you guys! Bitchface Briarwood! I do have a page. Do you want my beholder page? That's terrible for me, too. Oh, give me that back page. Sorry. I also gave you advantage on everything. I think you didn't use anything. Seven. I had so much hope when we took down their tower. It went away very quickly. We all die. Ugh, should have done that fucking Feast! 13. Is it like Shapechange? Oh, it's True Polymorph. 27. They roll disadvantage against you, too. You rolled a 20? Oh, no. None of us can do anything to help him? Fucking shit. We can only be so hopeful. And if it's active? Being held. What's the deal with that? Oh, bitch! You better back off, bitch! Come on... Not again. Oh my god. That's not a spell, you guys! I don't know if Pike can fix this! Yeah. A natural 20 would break it, that's the only thing? I rolled like a 27. You have advantage on everything. That's good. That's okay. Oh my god, you rolled a 19. Was that the one you critted on? Did you count that one? They're broken from it by being in his gaze? Am I in his gaze? So I can still cast spells. But if I move into his gaze, I cannot. If I shoot up at Vecna, will it go through the cone? I will not go through the cone? It is now my turn. Why? He lost concentration? Is he 60 feet away from me? Is he within range? Should I handle Delilah, or should I handle him? Is he within 60 feet of me? Vecna. (counting) He's exactly 60 feet in the air. I have to get directly under his butthole. Can I get directly under his butthole? Jesus, balls. What about Delilah. Where is she? If I move at all, I'm going to take opportunity from skeletons. Jesus. Okay, I am going to head to Delilah. I can move up to her, correct? Can I? I can give her disadvantage on constitution checks, and whenever she takes damage, she's stunned, or should I do the confusion thing? I'm turning into Ashley Johnson. Okay. I'm going to go up to Delilah. (pants) Cotton mouth. Oh boy. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to go up to her and be like, experience what you've been putting all of us through. And I'm going to touch her and I'm going to try and cast Contagion on her with Mind Fire? That's telekinesis, Kyle! TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and I have a bonus to my spell attacks. It's cocked. That's even worse. Not great. 18? Her mind becomes feverish, and she has disadvantage on intelligence checks and intelligence saving throws, and she becomes confused. For seven days. Hopefully. I don't have a lot for a bonus. I can go into an elemental form. No, it just lasts for seven days. Okay. She has to make constitution saving throws. But she's under the effects right now, correct? We've been through this before, haven't we? It says after failing three of these saving throws, the disease effects last for the duration, so that would make me assume that she has it at least for three rounds. I almost did that. But it's a 5th-level fucking spell. That's a lot! That's lame. Three rounds for a 5th-level spell? Oh, he doesn't look happy. I feel like I just pissed off the DM. It does say that after succeeding on three of these, the creature recovers from the disease, so they were already affected. That's a natural one. 38? Is he moving towards the altar? No saving from it? Let's hope he doesn't roll a nine or a ten, y'all. You are fucking lying to me! (groans) No, that means he's disintegrated. There's no recovering from that, dude. She doesn't have to roll against that? He doesn't get advantage? Wait, with the Disintegrate? Go, Scanlan, go! Can you inspire yourself? But you're a war bard, right? War caster. That was a 6th-level spell? Does she have any more of those? Because I only have two. Just straight melee? My dice suck. It's not good. 13. Fuck it. Why am I light-headed? Don't fuck me, Gil! 22. Why didn't we Heroes' Feast? Oh no. He's going to turn to the cards, y'all. He's going to turn to those cards. What? Ugh! Okay. That's good. 14 plus 13, so 27. So if I kill him, he'll come back? Or if I kill him, Grog won't ever come back? What does that mean?! Is he always going to fucking fly? No! Wait, can I bonus action him? Can I use my bonus action? Kill her! Is that doubled? Are you shooting at Vecna? You're shooting at the death knight? TALIESi What are you trying to say? Are we going to bail? What do we do? But Grog. What about you? Scoop him into a little vial. So we're all together? Percy. Oh god. Okay. Are we trying to get to me so I can get us all out? But everyone's coming this way, right? Everyone's coming this way? Then I'm going to-- fucking hell. How does Fire Storm work? I know it's ten ten-foot cubes. Does it have to be on the ground, or can I hit him up there? Can I rain-- "justice rains from above!" Can I do that? But I'm not going to be able to hit the death knight and Vecna? What if I got out of the way. Could I? I'm going to do a bonus action and I'm going to go air elemental. Full-on, wrath of my people and my hometown, and I'm going to levitate in a cool tornado-y thing. That's high, but that's okay. In between, but don't worry about it. I'm going to right onto Vecna and try and swarm it down towards the death knight. Ten ten-foot cubes. What do you mean, hold on? What does he have to roll? Under my DC? Yeah, I'll try and levitate down a bit. I guess so. Scanlan! No! Mr. Mistoffelees, come back! He could be stuck there forever! We have to be touching. I can be wind now. What was the name of that one city, you guys? Syngorn. Is Syngorn still in the Feywild? Where did we go? What city in the Feywild did we go to? I can bring you back. We have to all be holding hands, y'all. Yes. Feel free to hit me. I don't care. I can't be grappled. Oh, he's flanked. No! Grog, we've got to get out! Hold hands. We'll talk later! Dust? And dust. It's very handy. Are we all holding hands? Are we all in position? Oh my god. We are getting out of here, right? I rolled a really fucking shitty initiative. Are we all here? We're all sure about this? We're out? 100%? We're on this plane, right? Then we're going to the Feywild! And we all hold hands-- Yes, I drop form and I pull out my tuning fork and my flowers, and I think deep about the Gilded Run and the Shademirk Bog and the beautiful pond that we appeared around, that we know there's a portal right near it. That's what I think about strongly, and I say, everyone think about the pretty ponds! Spring Break 2017, Feywild! I'm sorry. I would have taken us home, but we were already there, and I had to go somewhere else. I thought that we were pretty badass when we took the tower down, and we were not. I can get you back, man. I can get you fucking back! But True Resurrection says I can. I can't believe I fucking dumped my 9th-level spell in you, and then you got tied down. It made zero fucking difference. We both wasted our fucking 9th-level spells.
