I think he's going to be on. I think. Pretty sure. Yes! It's... me! (laughter) Again! I'm back! Go watch-- actually, we're going to be playing it over the course of the break. So that we have a break. So you'll watch it over the course of the break. It's getting really weird. You can tell it's such an outlet for us of the creative team. It's got a lot of meta things going on, reflecting our day-to-day lives. It always has been. It's great. Yeah. I hope everyone liked the panel, by the way. Yeah, thanks everybody who came! Apparently 2,800. 2,800 strong. Yeah, so many Critters. I know. That means it happened! Because the chain devil potentially knew-- Yeah. It's like texting in hell. 17. Yeah we did, for us. Does it have nice Roman-style shade and then little baskets? Okay, I'm going to scooch Vex over, be like, sorry, excuse me! I just want to-- And into the window? And I want to do-- Oh, sorry. Excuse me, Tary. Blight! Bees? 30. Am I within 30 feet? All right. Yeah, sure, I'll go through the window. Can I Blight and then back out? Back through the window? (grunts) Shit! Fuck! Are you serious? 20. Only half damage. 32 total? And yeah, am I able to like barrel roll, like through the window? Hang on! Wait! (laughter) Not like this! (laughter) I'm like the golden retriever with the stick. It's fine, I needed a tan! I was getting a little pasty. You legit shouldn't. Percival. (laughs) Are you having PTSD flashbacks, Percival? Are you okay? And my feet. You don't fuck with a ranger's bear! Already? I'm really glad you used that Luck! Oh, jeez! Okay. I roll over. It's okay, buddy! Just hang on. Tsunami coming though, look out! I'm going to do a Tidal Wave and go (bwoosh). Do you have the laser pointer? What are these red pools of things? It's molten blood? I want to try and avoid my friends. It's ten-foot-wide. In fact, there's a ten-foot gap, right, Matt? Between everybody? Right up front? It's ten foot, right? Can I do my Tidal Wave from this direction backwards? Ten feet. Who's it going to hit? I know Grog is dextrous, so Grog can take it. Sorry, Grog. But I want to start here and go backwards. Towards you. No, Grog, to get hit. Yeah. It's a ten-foot-wide column that I just want to go back. Or Grog! Sorry, I was confused, when you said Grog. So who's it going to hit? Tova. Only because I think she's more dextrous than him. No, it's not that much. Five, six, seven-- Ten, and a reroll, I do an eight! So that's eight-- 23 damage, thank you. And he should be knocked prone-- No, it's an eight. Wait, five, seven, that's 10, 18. 18 damage. And he's knocked prone. And then the water spreads across the ground in all directions, and extinguishes unprotected flames in an area within 30 feet of it? That's all I cared about, mainly? Okay. I tried. Sorry, guys. I'm going to back up as-- Can I crawl? Do I have enough movement to crawl back through the window? I'll do that. Yeah, I want to keep it, use it as like cover. You do. Where are the little pissant guys? I'm going to hop through the window again. I'm going to cast Sunbeam. Yeah. Negative. Negative again. 6d8? Can I have two more d8s, please? Those were definitely d6s. Thank you. Oh that's good. 30 points of radiant damage. I look at Tary. Tary is within 30 feet of me, yeah? I don't see Tary. Do I see anyone else, and does anyone else look rough? Do I see Tova? Okay, I say, hey, sorry about the whole Tsunami thing. You got this! And I give her a Healing Word at level one. I'm going to give you-- shit-- plus my spell modifier. Sorry, nine hit points. Yeah. Tiny pockets, this is a problem of women's fashion, to be fair. Why tiny pockets? Come on women's fashion, come on. Doesn't matter, he's dead. He's so dead. Get that Grit back. You get another Grit back! Get that Grit back. In the fetal position. That's totally correct, yeah. Someone's unconscious and we can't tell that they're unconscious. That's not great. Saving, dex, 14. We're both grappled? Fucking dick. I have advantage on that. I'll take that 18. Yeah, I just have to beat the damage, correct? 18. Aw, desu desu. What? 32? I mean, yeah. 17 plus 20. Plus 23-- My Sunbeam. Can I use my reaction to cast Absorb Elements? Yes, I do. Never done this before. Let me double-check. I capture some of the energy and I store it, and I have resistance to the next damage type that I take that, and the first time I hit with a melee attack on my next turn, I can do an extra 1d6 of that damage type. Beautiful. So another 11 would've made it 82. Okay. I have to beat a ten, correct? Nope. Wait, what do I add? Oh! No, I'm good, then. I'm good, that's exactly a 17? What? It's me attacking. 60-- wait, how?! Halved. Is it halved? Wait, what? MATT, MARISHA AND It's not. I mean, I'm still up. With 20 hit points. No. I was at 82 minus 62, which means-- 20 points. (sighs) Okay. Time to go big. I am going to cast Shapechange, my 9th-level spell, and I am going to turn into a fire giant. Yeah! So as I'm down, my eyes light up, and I start to turn into a giant. And I want to reach up and grab him by the throat and try and stand up and see if I can pile-drive him. I am. Is this plus 11 just to my attacks? Natural 20! (cheering) How do you know what basic damage is? Well, it just gives me multi-attack. And it gives me a greatsword melee attack. That is 6d6. That is one, two, three, four. I need one more. Ten, 16, 24 damage. 24. Right! So, doubled that, so 48 damage. Plus seven, yeah! (grunts) Well, I didn't move. Yeah. I stand up, and I look at Grog. And in Giant I say, "'Sup." What's up, man? Yeah! Yeah? Ooh! Am I still all fire giant form? That's cool. Okay. With disadvantage? On both of them? Just one of them? That's eight plus 11, so that's 20-- So that's 7d6 plus six. One, two-- (very deep voice) I imagine he's going to tell the others. Oh, this Shapechange has so many weird things! That's fantastic! 18. Hi, Tary! I'm Antlers! Fist bump. Your bear-kini. Aww! Can I pick him up by his ankles and schoolyard bully-style shake him out from his feet, upside-down? For pocket change. I Shapechange back to Keyleth for a second. Do you know which section of the prison they're in? Aw. The worst idea you could ever do. Well, okay, hang on. What happens next? Because aren't we supposed to be arrested next? I think reinforcements are here. Did I see anything that looked like guards that wore like the armor? The gold armor? No, throughout the city. Just in general, since I've been in hell. What are they? Were there any like erinyeses or succubuses that were also guards that would be one of these people? I know, but I could still be a guard and follow you guys there. Then I'm someone on the outside and not in prison as maybe a first responder. If I say, hey, I found these guys, and I walk with you guys all the way to the prison? Can I stealth? Can I turn into one of the impish creatures in gold armor? Have they seen me yet? I don't have the gold armor. Never mind. I'll just be myself for right now. Who's all been seen? That's a lot. Are those bone demony guys? I'll turn into one of the bone devils. I'll turn into a bone devil. (speaks fake Infernal) Fucking hell! Eight. Total. I give him a little bit of a twitch, like maybe I'm the damaged bone devil. Oh god. Okay, I drop form. Fuck this asshole. Right, left, yeah, right, left, straight, straight, right, left, straight? LAURA AND Right. I mean, I could probably also Beast Shape out of this if I really wanted to. Well, you know, I was kinda waiting to see what everybody else did. TRAVIS AND Okay. And I Beast Shape into a rat. Technically, yeah. And then I shape back to Keyleth. And then keys. Keys, right there on the other side or something? Keys? I'm going to do a Thorn Whip. Thorn Whip them to me. Wait. Oh, sorry. Which are in the satchel on the other side of the bags, right? I got it! Okay. Are there any other extra lockpicks in here? Investigation check? Natural one. Honey, you're a hoarder. We really need to clean out your purse. I really can't find any-- Wait, who's stuck? Fucking doors! It's always doors! Do we want to take a short rest while we're supposedly-- All right, let's go. I can do that to us. Is everyone cool with that? I can still Plane Shift us, so I can burn one of my higher-level spells-- like an eight on the scale of zero to nine-- and be animals, and then I can save my seventh-level for Plane Shift in case of emergency. Can I not do that with Animal Shapes? I can't turn into the insects? Hm. Have I seen anything, like flies or rats or anything like that? Hang on, I've seen rats, and I've seen what? Have I seen any-- I've got to be beasts. Are there anything like bats? Have I ever seen any bats? I mean, technically, with Animal Shapes, I can change us with an action. Correct? Yeah, as long as we don't get caught. All right. So we're starting as bats. Bats? Correct. So as long as we're cool with me losing my ninth-level Shapechange. I can't escort us as an erinyes anymore. How much longer is my Shapechange left? It lasts for an hour. I don't speak the shit. So, bats! Wait, I can technically make some of us bats and some of us other things, correct? I can choose. Does anyone not want to be a bat for any particular reason? Sonar. Echolocation. We have Darkvision. Bats go in swarms. We're all bats. This is the best. Plus ten. 26. We can always be rats whenever the time is necessary! Keep going. Come on, come on! Come on! Hang on. Well, technically, what do bats have? 5e bats-- Bats-- That's true. We are a swarm of bats. (bat squeaks) Those bats were jus-- I made no promises other than bats. Go, go, go! And we're definitely doubling our movement here. And we're dashing Bat AC. We did pretty good, you guys. We got pretty far. All right. Not great. I don't know. If we can get in and out of this quick and keep going-- -- because I can keep turning us into these. 11. As long as I don't lose concentration I can keep turning us into different things. Correct. It's a concentration of up to 24 hours, so as long as I don't use a concentration-- On a subsequent turn, I can use my action to transform affected creatures into new forms. 11. Not great. Correct. So that's probably exactly what I'm going to do, is to try and not get hit, by the by. "Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range, you transform each "target into the form of a large or smaller beast." Oh, shit. Can I change people as a bat? But can I stay as a bat and change other people? Yeah? Okay. I'm going to turn-- do you want to be a bat, too? I'm going to turn both Vax and Percy into bats. What? I asked what you wanted to be and you said a bat. Bat! We're both bats! And we're peaced out again. If we can, we're going to peace out. I'm going to look at Vex and go (squeaking noise). Uh-huh. I'm following her! Vex was leading the way, she knows where to go. Right, yeah, to the right. Yeah, as far as we know, the right means right. Let's go! Dear god, I can't believe this shit. But I was holding my movement to move with Vex. LAURA and I can't fucking hold a movement. I did an action to make sure they were bats. Currently, 16. So it's six plus four total? So, ten? Okay. Good the first time. Good the second time. And seven plus my constitution, correct? So that is an 11 the third time. All three. You're welcome! Did we heal any? We didn't do any of that healing or anything, did we? That's cool. Hit. Yeah. I mean, I'm about to go down. I make it! I'm down. Everyone's about to hit the ground. And you're all human. Really not looking good. Oh my god, I've never been here. I don't want to die. Who do I do this to? I did. It's a 13. Technically. Yeah. I was going to switch dice, but that's a 13, I'll take that. No. Okay. Don't fuck me Gil. I'm good. I'm good. It's a 12. I rolled a 12. A success. What did you just say? Yeah, I know. No, we're good, guys. Come on. I'm great, I'm good. Okay, all right. So we have the extreme hint. That was awesome. It was going great. Okay. I'm conscious. Oh, okay. Vax! I'm at 49 hit points. Can you help me up? No Coke, Pepsi. (sing "mmmbop") Yes, from the gods. Come on, Grog! Come on, kill it! Yeah, into the corridor. I hold my Wall of Stone, since he has that, because I don't want to make it apparent. The doors, always. This is Matt Mercer we're talking about. Wait, is this it? Is this where we're supposed to be? To freeze? Yeah. We have our shit back, right? 17. Yep. Oh, that's good, that's great. Okay. I need to stay alive. Who's close to me in a 30-foot radius? And who's looking rough? Okay. I want to start backing out a little bit, and who's lowest on hit points? Legit. LAURA AND Me, Tova, Taryon, and I can pick three more people. I'm going to do a Mass Cure Wounds. Vax. Anyone else looking relatively low? I can do it to six people. And Grog. And we're going to do a Mass Cure Wounds. 3d8 plus my spellcasting ability. Okay. Oh my god, that's amazing. Oh, that's a one. No, only if it's elemental damage. Eight, 16, 17 plus six. 23 points. And then I'm backing out a little bit. Yeah, away from the chain golem. Yeah. That way. Fucking hell. Yeah, I'll risk it. I can do it one more time, but only to an animal, not an elemental. Yep. Miss! Are you going to be honest? You're taking it for me? Thanks, boyfriend! Yeah, that's cocked. As I move out? But I healed? Okay. So I'm at 60 points, right? Fucking, umbilical cord. Get out. Don't fuck me, Gil. Oh, that's good, Gil! 19 plus four, 23. Gods damn it. Oh my god, like Guardians of the Galaxy, you guys? I'm holding my turn and reaching out and trying to make this chain as much as I can. As soon as everyone links hands, we're out. That's fine. Can I do a bonus action to heal-- who's looking rough? Okay, I'm at 59 hit points. I'm going to heal myself. Yeah. 2nd-level. That's four plus another three. 73. Sorry, 73 hit points. Home. Whitestone. Exandria. And I just take whatever leftover action I have to be like, Vox Machina, come on! Come on, Percy. We just need a chain. Yeah. Can you throw your dagger and hit me? You can't do anything else. You can't hit me? You fucking ass. Goddamn it! Please! We made it out, right? We've had good themes of guests killing bosses. LAURA AND Because Mary killed the white dragon. Look at that! And Lumberjanes!
