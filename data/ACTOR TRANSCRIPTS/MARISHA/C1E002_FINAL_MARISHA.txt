We can't donate tonight yet? But you can still go to the Time Travel Mart in Echo Park and you can also go to their website, 826LA, and I'm sure you can donate through there if you want to do that. Oh wait, Nostoc. He's not even listening, he's just walking off. (group laughs) Yeah, mmm. Ooh, shall we turn and follow? Well I'm not an eagle. But I am still poisoned. Oh, that'd be great. I made the second one. A 10. Plus my constitution which is two, three, thirteen. Yes. To the hole. Speaking of outsiders, you wouldn't happen to have seen a Lady Kima, would you? Contracts. Love contracts. Smells like its been in the barrel for a hundred years. Balgus. Yes, could we do that? Is this considered a short rest? Oh. Hieris, do you know if there's any other entrances into the mine? Any old secret tunnels, something that someone could be using to get in? One last question. You should come drink with us at the tavern. Oh, that'd be nice. Oh, we should get him something other than dried fruit. That's not good for diabetes. Cross-Realm. Maybe they have magical items. I want stuff. All stuff. So wait-- it seems like they really don't want you in their door. It seems very heavily guarded. So what's our plan, we just going to try again? Let's do it. It's the mine that never sleeps. Eat some veggies! Fruit's bad for the diabetes! And then you just throw it at him? That's not polite, Grog. I'm gonna go ahead and turn into a squirrel and hide in your pocket. Okay. Can I do a nature check to see what light source is making all this grass grow, or if it's like magical growing? Is that a talent you picked, is that a feat? Phrasing. What are you casting? I think you'll just, like, hit a wall. Wait, wait, wait, I'm in squirrel form. So I go out. Holy shit. What the fuck. Breathe. No wait wait wait! Cast it on me! I'm a squirrel in her pocket. I guess it's Keyleth. (bad Scottish accent) Oh, hello. (group laughs) Keyleth is not good at this. I hail from the mountains up north. Wait, persuasion--I don't have--oh, wait. I have a zero. Eight. Oh, I have advantage. Oh, disadvantage. So eight. And I've been practicing my Cornwall accent for five minutes. Shit. I'm sorry. I didn't think about the fact that I was gonna have to do an accent. I'm not good with that stuff. Oxygen's good, although if we have something to help with poison, that might be good. Can we get some antidotes? Oh, we were just there. We don't have Pike, though. I'm still not feeling well. On second thought, I'll just read some books tonight, Refresh myself on my healing spells. It's what she's good at. How much are the greaters? I'll take one. You should. It's been a bad day for rolls. It's been bad day for rolling. To be fair, it's been a long day. I'm still bleeding everywhere. It's the boot, yeah. I like the idea of magic perception. I'm gonna assist her, look for animal tracks. Five. Good. "The trail's going cold!" Yeah, I feel like going down. Let's go further, all the way down. Get low. This is scary. I've never been on one of these before. It's really tight. It's really dark, tight. Keyleth's getting a little claustrophobic. She's never been in this tight of a space. Please don't do that. Most of them. Legolas style. Yeah. What about the walls? How close are the walls? Are there any scratch marks or anything like that on the walls? But there are the drag marks all the way? Oh shit, I hope he didn't hear me just say that about him. Dammit. Are there any drafts? Do I feel any wind flows or anything like that? And so, that is how I spent my 12th birthday. Let's see, what else. I agree with that. Into the river? Like it goes into the water? Why don't we send-- Stealth twins. A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (lightning roars) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants. Literally. Born to the air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei, where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts, which I do. Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Kohren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hikes down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind Is she even worthy? Yareth. (group repeats Yalreth in funny voices) Oh. Making it old school. While he does that, I'm gonna go ahead and turn into a cave bear. Cave bears have darkvision. Yeah, subterranean bears, they have darkvision. No, leave it off! Fuck! Fuck! It's been a bad night. 12 total. And I just go (roaring noise) I know. (roars) Grog! You're right there in front of it. The biggest and most viable visual it can find. I know, it's been so bad. Uh, it's okay. 17 as well. Is this what confused you and had you running out the door? Oh, no. Okay. Um, I'm a bear right now. Bring out Minxie. Okay, first and foremost, I'm gonna go ahead-- and I don't know if this is gonna help. But I'm gonna throw up a fog cloud. Maybe. No? But it screws our vision, though, doesn't it? But I mean, we wouldn't be able to see them. Would it help with the confusion is what I'm hoping. Or would it be bad? I'm bursting out a fog cloud, and then-- Oh, that's right. I didn't throw a bow. I'm a bear. Nevermind, I'm just gonna do a full round of attacks. That one right there. I'm a cave bear, I'm blind. I'm like a blind fish. I have darkvision and, like, cataracts. Well I'm a bear. Not whispering sweet nothings in his ear. I'm gnawing at his leg. Make a charisma saving throw? That's good. 16. Urgh, I'm a bear! Okay. Now I'm attacking. First one probably misses. With my claw, 14. With the claw attacks, do I have two claw attacks, do I roll for both? Okay, so the first one is 19, Second one, second claw attack is 18. Okay. So I am doing 2d6 plus five twice. So six plus-- Five, so 11. Plus 17-- 20 damage. Oh, 25. Sorry, 25. 25 damage. Me and Trinket. Going at this. (Matt laughs) Hits. Hits. Hits. What was the last one? Back at him, yeah. Whoo! Rage! No, dammit. Yes! Tiberius, help. Nice. (Orion spits) Oh, we've got these. Big money, no whammies. Woo! Gnomewatch 2015. A snail? Aww! Oh yeah, inspiration. Nice. [Orion And Marisha] Undercarriage. I wanna take the umber hulk into the creek right behind me. All right. How do I grapple as a bear? I can be a a rhinoceros. It just hasn't been useful yet. I'm waiting for the right time. Oh my god, can you make me smoke bombs that smoke, and I say, "It's morphin time"? Okay. That's what I want to do. So I just strength check then? Oh. I don't have stats, I'm a bear. But all I have are the basic six. Five. So that's what I do. Going for the throat. I'm taking him underwater. Pulling him underwater. No, I'm holding on to him. Against his strength, I guess. Ah, 20. Hits. I'm a bear, my armor class is 12 right now. I keep my armor class? I do gain its armor class. So it hits. It's okay guys. I am no longer a bear. Can I cast a concentration spell on myself? And that's it. Hey brah. Sup? Fancy meeting you here. (laughs) That's an attack. Oh, I'm fine. It was at least badass. It was very elegant. Oh, I loved Crawline, she was so nice. Whoo! Oh wait, but it's disadvantage. Which are both your critical, right? Which are both my criticals. So a critical at a disadvantage. But that one's critical. So it doubles, right? Oh. Um, cool. (Liam laughs) Word. I'm still a person. I'm gonna go ahead and also do a call lighting spell. Bam, call lightning right on its head. 'Cause he's wet. Got him right in the ass. It just gets straight damage? I get 3d10. 6, 7-- 11 damage. Saving throw, mm. I go over to Scanlan, and I just, I just lay my hands on him, and I cast Cure Wounds in a level 2 spot. You do-- it's 2d8 plus 10 healing. Do I roll or does he? I'm doing Cure Wounds on him. At level two. Do I roll? So you heal, 16, 20 points. Yeah. I'll follow after Vax. That was a Coleman, alright? (group laughs) That was a very expensive sleeping bag. Brain? That can't be good. Nice. I don't know. (Travis moans and strangles) Okay, so I am going to take this and move up to about here, I guess. Is where I can see. And then I'm gonna take this little block of stone right here, this stalagtite or mite or whatever it is-- --and I'm gonna use Wall of Stone. And instead of creating a wall, I'm just gonna take that one and I'm gonna push it (imitates thudding) against that wall and try and crush those guys. I'm gonna take this wall, and I'm gonna go crunch. I don't know. We'll find out. I'm trying to earthbend this wall. Yeah, that's a waste of time. Instead, I will-- I still got a Call Lightning going. Fuck it. I'm just gonna lightning bolt some bitches. Well, then I move to where I can. Did I? Fucking Seattle assholes. That's awesome. Oh, no. (Travis laughs) That's a good number. He needs a Magneto helmet. What?! The brain fucker. He's a lover, not a fighter. Lobey. Let's call him Lobey. (Laura laughs) Can we call him Jeff, Jeff Lobey? You killed Jeff Lobey. Lisa Lobey! (group laughs) They just keep going! Professor Grog's having a hard time. Get him a pillow! What! Yeah, he's got a gun. We got one? Well, then. If we got the guy we need. I will move over a bit. Yeah. And... (imitates energy firing) Not having control. I do (mumbles). Okay. So that is... what is that? 22? That's my turn. Do I? "The poo cloud." We'll figure that out when we kill this guy, I guess. He can't dispel it, It's not magic. But I might be able to cure him afterwards. I might be able to. That's the one Liam has. I was gonna say, can I go over and heal Grog before we end? Damn it. Yeah, you get a Player's Handbook. That's lucky. Nice. (Matt laughs)
