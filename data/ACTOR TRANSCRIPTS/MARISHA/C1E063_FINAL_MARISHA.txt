We confirmed. How do you mean? Yeah, how do you mean, feeling? The Hut of Wodenna, right. Yes, it was on Garmelie's list of things to avoid. I wonder if she knows the other hags that we've encountered. Well, see, you guys did kind of jump, and it didn't feel good, right? So... One, I'm certain she is lonely, and two, she's probably the hag. She's definitely probably the hag. I feel like we're trying to talk ourselves out of this, aren't we? Okay, we'll not go towards the hut. It's probably now. Okay. That's true. You were inside his gut. You have to remember that. All right. New d20. That's a dick move. That is a-- He got a 19 and I got a three. It's a step in the right direction. 20. Yeah, Dispell Magic. Poor reception. Okay. Can we see the hag moving inside the hut through the window? Oh my god. 14. Yeah, she's inside. Northeast? Northwest. Northwest. This direction. This direction. Oh man, that makes me want a Scanlan backpack. Oh man. I don't know. That happened. To be fair, also, everything in the Feywild-- -- has been more sensitive, defensive, and more intelligent. Everybody freeze. Is it to the northwest? Ooh. Well, okay, is what we're trying to do figure out a way to not have to walk in the muck? You're-- That's what I was gonna say, I can always polymorph you for a moment, Grog. You want to be a monkey? Yeah. What kind of monkey? Okay. And I turn Grog into a gorilla. Which might be more intelligent than what he was before... I think I do. I do, but I don't have it in my little book. Looks good on you, Grog. Ooh, you'd be like a little silverback baby. Okay, I know the twins are good on flying, for the most part. Well, but you can walk unhindered, right? You can walk fine? Can someone borrow your broom? Again. (laughs) Give it to your brother. He's trustworthy, right? Right? Right, Vax? Oh, right, that's true. I'm gonna go ahead, I'm gonna use a Beastshape and I'm gonna go into an eagle form. I can carry Scanlan. To be fair, I've been flying a lot longer than you have, Vax. It's true. Ooh, potion of climbing, nice. All right, I fly over to Scanlan. (eagle sound) Like scout? I go ahead and I take off with Scanlan and do kind of a high aerial loop around the tree. Just at the top, really high. Really high, getting nice-- Watch. Do I have advantage because I'm an eagle? Don't eagles have advantage? I do have advantage. Okay. Eagle eyes. 27. Like sap. Like even the top of the tree and stuff. Evil maple syrup, yeah. I know, that's intimidating. Still on my back, Scanlan, you wanna get closer? And I'll do kind of a tighter loop around it. See if I can get any more details. I was doing a tighter loop. Of the tree, see if I can get any more details that we haven't already seen. Okay. I fly back to the others. It's up to me. I drop Grog's polymorph and my eagle form. ...after I've landed. Is this what we were talking about that time? Swamp shoes. I can help you with those. That mud looked at me the wrong way. I can go. Sounds fun. Something that burrows. I guess I technically could've taken a short rest, correct? In the time we're just chilling? Okay, well, I'll take a short rest. I just want to take a short rest, just-- Yeah, just enough time, and then I'm gonna turn into an earth elemental and I'm gonna swan dive-- I thought we were in the mansion. Oh. Did I say something? I don't know. You've clearly been moisturizing. Yeah, I do the same. Oh my god. This is horrifying. Ten. 10. Percy, catch me! Yeah, can we have the mansion? I mean, we can still come in and out of the mansion. I take my fire hands and I see if I can light the gunk on fire. Okay. I start taking my short rest. I dunno. After. Is that enough time? I druidcraft the shit out of those. Did you get that from a fortune cookie, where'd you get that? I really wanna swan dive into the muck. If I tighten my abs and keep my feet together, it shouldn't make much noise at all. I have been watching a lot of Olympics. I swan-dive. I take a minute to compose myself. And then-- --as gracefully as possible, pull like a Pocahontas, and then turn into the earth elemental as I dive in. Sail! I start to earthglide, breaststroking through the mud under the swamp to the tree. I'm heading towards it. How much further down is it? Okay, then I go down. I wanna use my tremor-sense too to just be aware. Okay. If I reach and out touch one of the roots, like just run my hand along it, what happens? I move back a little bit, kind of getting away from the tree. Do I sense any type of creatures living under here? Any movement, nothing crazy? Okay, I'm gonna start making my way back to the mansion. Ooh, like the swamp thing? Do I look like the swamp thing? That's cool. (rock noises) That's very poetic. And then I kind of make my way up and drop earth elemental form. Yeah, I think it's good, I didn't really see much or learn much more than we already knew. No creatures. The muck did not try to eat me. It's not as deep as I would've thought, actually. It's only three feet or so deep. I do believe that the tree is living, though. I think its roots were kind of twitching and moving around. It is a real tree. The roots were very turgid. Someone taught that to me earlier. I also walk in. Scanlan! Are you remodeling? I kinda fwooshed it off. I go downstairs to watch. Oh, and I help him finish the shoes by helping druidcraft them. I also go ahead and cure myself up. Eh. Wait, do we have any vague plan, wait, we plan at dawn? We'll plan at dawn. They go straight down? Maybe something has trees on its back and moves. I don't know, maybe. Was it coming from that direction? So the direction we came from. No. I don't think so. I've been helping Percy with his shoes. Just finished making shoes. Yeah, they might work. Thank you. Thank you. I'm proud of them, Percy. You were supposed to be a bootmaker. You're super-judgey. How do you mean, vanish? Like something really large passed in front of it? That's different. Do I know of anything that would cause that? Can I roll a nature check or something? Don't fucking fail me. (yells wordlessly) 14. That could be so many things. It's hard to say. It's producing a lot of it, too. Way more than it should. And a little bit of minerals and dirt. Well, we're also in the Feywild. Might not need the same thing. Well, I mean, nothing here has really been natural. So you think maybe it's the tree that ate that other group of trees? It's a cannibal tree? It's eating its own kind? Does Fenthras mean anything? Fenthras doesn't mean anything, right? Is that a name? Protector and growth. No, it seems-- Make some maple syrup? I mean, when I was in my earth elemental form, I got up underneath the tree, I mean, I feel like if we needed to, I can get inside of it. Yeah, they're still sitting here today. It's fine. No. If anything, it's a terrible, terrible influence. Well, it's not short on water, that's for sure. I mean, it was sludgy enough. Was there groundwater? Right. When I communed with nature? Everything was alive everywhere. That's what, the rules here haven't really-- Yeah, I can. I can. I can. Do we have any questions that I might want to figure out before I-- Cure the tree, is the tree eating other things, can we cure the tree... Is that even a tree? I'll maybe try and figure out... okay, all right. I'm gonna go step outside. I have to be connected with the ground, I think. Okay, yeah, tie a rope around me. And I jump back in the mud. I'm gonna kind of lay back into it. Sensory deprivation tank-style. Um, okay. Can I figure out what is feeding the tree, what the tree, if the tree is consuming things around it, what is fueling the tree? I sense a lot coming out from the tree, that's clear, can I sense an energy going in towards the tree? What is fueling the tree, yes. Sondur. What is the tree's weakness? Who is Sondur? That's actually, I should've thought about that, that's a good one. Okay. Then can I ask the living fauna around me if this tree is sucking life force from them? Is the tree in the middle hurting the plants all around, like for example-- Is that all I got? Is the cancerous tree more than just a tree? Sure, that probably... sure. Sondur. Sondur, that's... (laughs) Flight of the Sondurs. Is it an elven word? Percy. You've done a lot of reading of the elven culture. Do you know anything about a Sondur? Yes, Grog? It didn't appear to be one thing. Because it was harming the plant life around it. So it's not necessarily all connected, it seems. But it is also definitely not just a tree. Didn't you get a bunch of salt when you jumped into the-- --when you did the cannonball contest? It was a bow that felled the titans. I do, it's just... where. How do I find it, exactly. When did we talk to her? All right, Feywild, hang on. God, I was clearly writing incredibly fast. I have 'archfey, black heart'. He was an arch-- yes, go ahead. So we can assume that the archfey is probably Sondur. And he's probably still inside the tree, and he probably is not gonna let go of his bow. And then he must have fought in what was known as the Calamity? Where does 'black heart' come from? I wrote down 'black heart'. Seemed important. 'Cause he was corrupted. Okay. So someone's going into the tree. Maybe. I can. I can attempt to talk to the tree. Huh? (laughs) Why are you acting this way? Please give us your bow, yeah. So wait, are we here on a mission to cleanse the land? Is that what we're posing as? We're like missionaries? It would be a wonderful thing. Just chicken and waffles. Yes. Kind of like snowshoes but with more surface area. Basically, wood paddles on our feet. Yeah. But you have that. I won't take that. Are we still doing our-- We'd have to make that decision now, while I'm learning my spells at the top of the day. That is true. That is an old Druidish proverb. Yep. I'm kinda wondering if the tree has a tremor-sense. Wait, is it the same... maybe it is something big blocking it, with like an invisible field? I don't know. I don't know. We tried. What are you drawing? Oh, yeah. How is my tree? Scanlan! Are we trying to talk to it first? And I make myself to look like the tree-dick on my forehead. I cast Speak with Plants. Are you waiting for me? Sondur. Can you hear me? I am Keyleth from the Air Ashari. Druids of the prime realm. Are you still present? We would like to see your heart. Me and my fellow companions are coming in. I go in first. Just army crawl. Me. Bringing up the rear this time, Grog. Watch the-- Wait wait wait. We're not alone. He's watching us. Sondur. Is this you leading us straight to you? I look at Scanlan and wipe the tree-dick off my forehead. I stand as well. He's a dick. Oh shit! Oh, fuck. No, he was a fucking cock. No, dude. Like you said, I don't trust anyone who says we're alike, you and I. I also don't like anyone who tries to act like we didn't make our own choice to come in here. That we're totally different. Yeah. 15. Oh, bow's on the ground, bow's on the ground. What does that mean? Where's that dice? Yeah, right? Not bad. 20 total, 20 total. Damn. That's half. Oh, that got so awkwardly quiet. It just sounds weird inside the tree... Acoustics. Preferably in rose gold. (The music comes back in, less distorted.) Yes, much better. Much better. You're good. It appeared he took damage from the necrotic? So he can take necrotic damage. Good to know. On the necrotic damage. Hell yeah. Hell yeah, Scanlan! Hell yeah. (All laugh.) Whoa. Yeah. That makes sense. It's what I would do. I was thinking fire too. Fuck yeah! (laughing) Yeah, you're not grappled. Yeah, rejection. He's been alone for too long. No, you're not. Ooh, fuck. I'm gonna go for the ents. All right. So you go first, then. Fire. Fuck yeah. Pew-pew. The CEO of this tree. That was really good! That's pretty good. Okay, so these trees that are moving appear to be living trees more or less, correct? I'm gonna cast Tree Stride on myself. And then I'm gonna go into fire elemental form and flame on. No, and I don't know if it's really gonna work. Oh, I've been a fire elemental before, yeah. Well, I'm casting Tree Stride. Right. I'm casting Tree Stride because it's a concentration that lasts a minute. And then I'm going to use my bonus action to flame on. If this works. All the rage of the fire ashari. And then I'm going to enter inside that treant right in front of me. I'm going to very nicely enter it with its permission and consent. And then I'm going to multi-attack. Well, ideally, because as per the rules of Tree Stride, I may use, I instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind and as part of my movement I can pass into any other trees of my choice of that same kind. So I'm gonna take this guy on for right now. We'll see. Those are pretty good. The first hit, sorry, I don't know my... I'm trying to find what I add here. Okay. So the first one is going to be 25 to hit. And the second one's going to be 16. Fuck yeah. Flame hands, which is an additional d6, correct? So I am rolling 2d6 plus three twice, so I'll do 4d... or, I'll roll 3d6 twice. First one... not bad. Eight plus five is 13, plus another three, so 16. 16 for the first one. The next one is 14. And until the creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes-- oh, it also, anything that if I move within, it immediately takes 1d10 damage whenever I move into its space. Nine. That I am satisfied with, yes. Yes. It is now a safety hazard. Careful for falling limbs. Sondur. What up! I think this is caramel? Nope, fudge. I got the fudge end. Including me inside the treant? 16. Am I immune to that as a fire elemental? Just resistant to it. I take half damage. How much did you say it was? 24? I'm immune to prone. Other way, I think. I give off a soft glow. That's always a bummer, man. That sucks. Immune to grapple. Calling in the cavalry. It does. Unless he douses himself, he takes another 1d10. Six. You're still-- Where is he? Where are you, Scanlan? I might be able to try and do something, if I can go first. Maybe I can burn you away. Fucking dick. Oh man. Okay. I am going to march over to that, oh man, to that guy. Number two. Treant number two. I want to see if I can Tree Stride through him-- I did. Even though I have resistance on bludgeoning damage and all that shit? Oh, my constitution modifier? As a-- Just my modifier? Eight. Fuck! Well, I still whelm him. That guy in front of me. I still can move into his space. That's my fucking opal dice again. Asshole. Oh look, and that was 18. Two slam attacks. Do I roll with advantage? No. No, I'm rolling my three dice. Oh, wait, no, I don't think I did. I forgot that part. Oh, man. Two 11s. Which, 17 to hit both times. Okay, so the first one, um. 15 for the first one. And another 15 for the second one. He's on fire. Oh, and he takes another d10 because I moved into his space. So another four points from me. Yeah. That sounded like a lot of dice. You all right? Still up. Two can play at that game, motherfucker. C'mon, c'mon. Aw, Pythagoras's theorem, man, c'mon, that's right at 60, right? A-squared plus b-squared equals c-squared? C'mon. Still up? No, it's when I'm-- Five feet, maybe? Wait. I think it's when I'm sharing space. Is he dead? He's dead. Let's make s'mores after this! Wisdom. 18 plus 11, so 29. Oh my god. I mean, he's gotta be pretty angry. I'd be angry. Exactly where Grog was? That's cool. She's down. What? What? Fucker's having a good round. I don't know if I can be grappled. We can Dimension Door, though, I can try and take you-- I can try coming to get you undone. No, I mean, I mean burn you from the vines. Like get you ungrappled. I don't know if, so, question. Could Bigby's Hand toss a fire elemental's ass? So it's like a magical hand meets magical fire elemental could kinda work? All right. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go over to Scanlan and I'm gonna burn the vines around him that are holding him in. That's my action? I go, "Okay." And I hold my action until I wait for Scanlan. I wait for Scanlan. To-- To throw me. It was girl power that healed you. I'm feeling it, yeah. Spice magic. This is my jam. I turn into a fireball myself. Very gently. God damn it! Five points halved, or was that-- Did I? Can I-- I can't do that. I gotta be there. Do I still have any movement? 50. Can I start climbing 25 feet up the wall? Okay. Not good. Five. Okay, well then I'm gonna take the rest of my action, I'm just going to angrily slam into the tree, and see if I can catch the tree up under him on fire. That would've been so cool had it worked. I know. You're down again, aren't you? Blight's nasty. The breeze from his wings kinda stokes my fire elemental form a little bit and I'm kind of into it. This guy had a rough breakup or something, man. Come on, Percy. (laughing) Don't care. Do you crit on a 19? Fuck. That's a good roll, though, that's a good roll. Dead-ent dead-ent dead-ent dead-ent-- Yeah, Grog! Yes! You basically killed him with bro-shame. And I go for it, too. Heeheehee. I drop my fire elemental form. You know, from him I think that was a compliment. Yeah. I go up to Vex and I just grab her arm and I say, Don't let any man-- or anyone for that matter-- make you feel like you need them to be great. Because you don't. I'm not good with words. But he was an asshole. And I don't want you ever dating an asshole. He wasn't good enough, he was mean. (in an exaggeratedly evil voice) You drug your friends to their doom. We keep making a show. I drop to my knees and do a Commune with Nature. Do I gather a different energy from the surrounding plants? Do I still sense the presence of Sondur? Do, last question. Does the tree seem happier? What is the tree gonna do from here on out? What are you gonna do, tree? Exist, cool. Everything seems great. This big one? Yeah, you know, the tree just told me that it actually feels much better, so. Trees that won't take it personal. Do you want to hit something? Here, I'm-- You guys ready to go home? I think I've seen enough of the Feywild for now. No, no, no. That can't be good. Garmelie? And I cast Hold Person at the same time. 19 for mine as well. What are those words? You know, for someone who hates the theater, you've made quite a show of all this. (All laugh.) Wodenna. Did you know Sorudin? Sorudin the Happy? I have a feeling we'll meet you again, Artagan. Everyone hold hands and say Kumbaya. We've dealt with enough scorned lovers for one day. I guess Whitestone? I take his hand. I say, You haven't been quite bad, yourself. And then we go to Whitestone. You got your bow! Man, that guy tried to act like he knew you. Fuck that shit. Oh, dude. That's cool, she's like Hanzo. Out of their corpse? Yeah, can we talk about that dog? Can we talk about it? Back in Whitestone!
