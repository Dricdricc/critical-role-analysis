And definitely blood on the Wyrmwood. Do you have a change of pants? I saw Max holding that tubing. Should have asked. Should have known. Yeah, jumped the shark on that one, man. Do you want to go take a flash shower? New episode! Whoa, you guys! New episode of Handbooker Helper, and it's Liam, giving you the first quick-build on how to build a rogue. Also, super quick, to address all the people who are a little confused why we went from dice basics to character sheets we're wanting to show that we're going to be doing a little bit of everything. We're going to be rolling out tips while we also build out character stuff. That way we can get newbies playing as quickly as possible, because in our experience, the first thing you do is push over a character sheet to somebody. We jump right in. Yes! So be patient! Rules are coming. It is coming. We can only produce as fast as Max's little hands can manage. It was so hard watching you deliver that while looking like you just murdered someone in cold blood. You were talking about wonderful things while looking so incriminating. What have we done? Why would you do this? We're here. What is there to do? What's the main points of historical interest? Is that where your mom works? Yeah, I want to see that. No. I want to see that. No. I've been landlocked my whole life, man. You guys are the only two. Oh yeah, why exactly aren't you allowed back home? Oh, that's right, to kill you. That's right. I mean, without pants, right? That's really funny. Yeah. Wow. Is that a chosen name? Is he an edgelord Sharp? Oh, he's a dumb dumb? Yeah, sure. So this was a random hit. He was a random hit job for your Traveler shenanigans. Can we see the ocean? Yeah, you definitely have sea creatures that haunt your dreams. You coughed up salt water, and you weren't even near the ocean. That feels like the ocean's real dangerous to me. A tentacle came out of the water? How close do we have to be to the ocean while we walk alongside it? So is there a location to go to the ocean? Fuck. Yeah. That's crazy. I've seen big lakes, but you can always see the other side. See, I like these literal examples. Because I've only read flowery poetry that makes it talk about-- Okay. Let's go. That cute little bob. So cute. You look like Catherine Zeta-Jones in Chicago. I love it. It is everywhere. It's so blue. They make horrible noises. I join Caduceus in the water. Can I go out to the rocks and see how far I can hop along the rocks? Yeah. 25. Beau is going to perch on the rock, and for the first time ever, willingly meditate, while just focusing on the blue that she is now surrounded by. Yes, yes! Yeah, owl's by the cart. We did some training on the road. I did. This is Professor Thaddeus. Exactly. I couldn't decide if he looked more like a professor or more like a Thaddeus and then I realized-- Exactly. No, Beau could not meditate for two hours. No. I meditate for ten minutes, tops. Then I go back and-- I want to train Professor Thaddeus to come when I look regal and hold out my arm. Professor! Professor, come! Exactly. Oh, that's pretty good! 21? I rolled a natural 18, 21. Can I have a gull? Thank you. He's so moody. Owls are dicks. Okay. No, I just nod and hope that Thaddeus is listening. Stop talking to my owl. 15 feet out is far. Is that-- it-- yeah, yeah, yeah. Can we camp on the beach? Okay, okay, okay. West coast. Yeah, I feel a little robbed. It's just gray and rainy where I'm from, all the time. Yeah. Yeah. It snows a lot. Ah. We have fog. It's on like the other side of the--? The lower part of the continent? Do they look like they're working, or do they look like they're--? Do they give these postings to people who are fuck-offs? Or do they give these postings to people who are-- Got you. Yeah. Are we talking about things in between? So what about mail fraud? Is mail fraud in there, or is it lesser than stealing? You are all accomplices. I just want to point that out. Yeah? Were you? Still got saltwater from where Fjord goosed you? So it's a big house, like a mansion? Wartime. I keep imagining Lord Strider. Is that Blinky? I think that was Blinky. Do you board animals? Cool. Here's the pigeon he's been eating. Sorry, it's a seagull. Professor. Here. I pay him. How much is it? For the service of boarding the animals? I give him five gold, because I saw Jester do that earlier and it seems to be the common courtesy of Nicodranas. Was that a lot of money? Steven Seagull. That's good. I'm going to Google it! Dip-i-- how do you spell it? It's shiny. It's shiny silk. Maybe it's a private show? Okay. We still have Caduceus. Yeah. I make myself look real big. Put my staff out. Yeah, holding the chair for Jester. Ten tables is a lot. Are they there? The two people? What do they look like? Jester. You recognize those stuffy pants people? Thanks. Table service. One platinum. Just like a Zemnian. I'm so ready. I'm ready for it! Y'all ready for this? Didn't want to go with Professor Thaddeus? Classy. (laughter) Dude, Jester's mom has got it going on. Does she only work on tips, or does she also get paid from the venue, or is that-- Oh right. I think you're pretty and graceful and pretty graceful. Are we supposed to follow? Okay, we follow. "Mar-quay-ee." What's up? I also kiss her hand. Do the finger tip thing back. Ah, Caleb. Love his hands. I would like to know what that means? Ionos is the time of year? No. Oh, yeah. To the Iron Shepherds. Right, okay. Yeah, kind of buff. What exactly does he do for the Clovis Conclave? Concord? We could just kick his ass, intimidate the shit out of him. Tell him he's not to fuck with you anymore. The old woman in the lighthouse? What? Accidentally? Do you know if there's a place where the lowlifes of the city like to congregate? The underground? I love celebrating fisticuffs. Algard, right? Yeah. I mean, you did take care of us in those early days, even if you didn't know it. Jester picked up the bill a lot. He's actually not The Gentleman. We met a guy who goes by the name "Gentleman." Oh, she's like-- oh okay, got it. I don't know who knows who. A wet walker! What?! And blue skin. What's happening?! This is why you can do watery stuff, right? Like cold stuff? Can you do that? The Leaky Nip. Leaky Tap! Not the Leaky Nip. I have it in the other book! Okay, we're fighting over taverns. We have nothing to offer, but we can provide many gifts. Wait, Bob Bobanon? Wait, Babenon what? And then compare! Oh hell yeah we are! This is the best episode of Maury ever! I'm glad that an offhand joke about The Gentleman led to this. Wait, let me see. It's very Scott Pilgrim. Have you seen this woman? Matt's a really good drawer. Let's see, let's see. So is it the same person? We need to know that. He's going to think he's being wiretapped. Did the guy that you know use words like "preposterous"? Is it? I don't-- it feels-- okay. Preposterous. Do you still love him? Or 30. Okay, let's go. Hey, crime boss, are you my dad? I guess it depends on if he's trying to hide it or not. What stories did your mom tell you about your dad? Maybe go to this Open Quay. Do you want to do two groups? All right. Maybe we can all meet up at the Quay afterwards. The Open Quay. Midday at the quay. I say okay. I don't know. I'll go with you. Biceps and triceps. Yeah. Okay. You didn't notice anything before when you came in as is? Do people not like you here? If you're not-- Deal. Am I your servant, your bodyguard? Am I your yes-man? I can be your yes-man. Copy that. He's staying at the inn. Of course the Wharfmaster is at the Wharf Load. We probably should have checked there first. Why didn't we do that? I definitely wrote down "Sloose Sweef." We sell things. Seems like a lot of dock spaces. Have a lot of openings? Business been slow? Oh sure. Just curious. (grunts) Sorry, salt water air is not (coughs) used to it. That went well, right? That was really great, right? I was fucking awesome! Thank you! I was just following your lead, man. You know, just nodding. And he said that guy hangs out at the dives. So like, two birds, one stone? Yeah, it is mid-day? It's mid-day. Yeah. We go to the Open Quay. Mother sent me. So many horses on this lighthouse! We should call him Al Gore! No. My passive perception? 13. 13. The chagrin? And it stands out like a sore thumb? I mean, it's on the way. You know, it's fine, exactly. Like people deliberately trying to stay away from it? Does it look like it's been there for a really long damn time? 15. Wait, nope, 19. Wrong thing. (sizzling) I mean, these bricks look so new. Did I see an entrance? No. Okay. Do you want to go that way and I'll go that way? Meet around? Okay. The fuck?! No, me neither. I know, I keep thinking of Allura's tower. I'd imagine you fly. Or maybe there's an underground entrance? Around, go under, and up? Are you asking me to try? All right, you want to give me a boost? Okay, I want to see if I can boost off of Fjord and maybe get up to this tower. Does it look like these are bricks that can-- It's very high. Wait, 25 feet, 45 feet? 25 feet's a lot. In diameter. But can I climb up to the balcony? Acrobatics, acrobatics. Yeah, one hundred percent, a terrible idea. A building that everyone is trying to avoid in town. 17. Not that one. Cobalt. I'll take the 17. I know, it was almost a 20. Oh, you dived out of the way? Catch me! Ca-- what?! My ass bone. I thought I would too! It's really slippy stone. Yeah, I already know this math. (laughter) I do. Which I've never had to use. But I reduce my damage five times my monk level, up to 20. Yes, definitely. Oh, I was just doing some one-finger push-ups. Also apparently he's a wizard that has a beef. The Sluice Weave? Yeah! No, we just heard about it. Well, we heard the whole thing was underwater. Did you hear that? Like submerged? Yeah. You know, I feel like you're throwing a lot of shade about us investigating this tower. Yeah, we were killing time. It is midday, we are at the Quay. What? I mean, you would think the wizard would be fascinated with the idea of the wizard tower that's very mysterious in the middle of the city. Do you have wizard envy? It's okay, it's a very large tower. Is that close to here? Well, let's go into the Quay, we haven't been in yet, right? Wait, but the Open Quay was a low-life dive, right? I thought The Skew was the low-life area. Is the Quay inside The Skew? Is there a bar? Okay, please do. Okay okay okay, that's 17 again. Nope, sorry, 15. Keep looking at the wrong numbers. Okay, once again with the shade towards trying to climb the tower. LIAM; It is open shade, Beauregard, because it has nothing to do with what we are trying to do today. I am not hiding my shade, it is out, I am providing shade for you. We have something to do! Yeah, I am blotting out the sun, we have shit to do! Let's go! I mean, this is coming from the guy who spent two hours in a smut shop trying to find magic. He's a fainting blink dog. (whispers) Rad. I know, so cool! It was so awesome! The tower! So there's a crotchety half-elf bartender, the tortle with tattoos, the redheaded human woman and then she was with a man? A salt and pepper situation. Ooh, I like that.
