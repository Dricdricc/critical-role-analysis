Soundbiting it up in that. It's like you're an actor. Well, they nominated us, so we got this far because of them, and now we lose to Markiplier. And Sean Becker. Who's my director for Signal Boost. All in the fam. In which particular way do you mean, aside from all of them? You're talking too much. It's not like I've made myself very accessible either. It's not on you. It might be a little on you, but it's on both of us. Anyway, my point is for the longest time, I was terrified that I was going to lose you. First to death and then to the Raven Queen, which is still kind of like death, and then ultimately to yourself. And then I had an interesting talk with Pike recently, and she said something that really stood out to me, and that was that some people just have more of themselves to give. And I realized this whole time that I was afraid of losing you to a future that ultimately has not yet been written, which is stupid. But you're ultimately right. We have nothing to lose. I love you, Vax. And I'm sorry for being me, that it took me this long to say it. Yeah. Me, too. That is pretty great, yeah. High five. Yeah! And that's it for now. Bacon. Trying to wrangle a beast? And what's our intent in Marquet? To get the next Vestige? Yeah, it's located in Whitestone Castle, correct? The teleport sigil? They said it hunted something really intense recently. Yeah, they went to the ocean. But I wrote it down. So it wants competition. The Slayer's Take should know. They've got contracts everywhere. We thought about it a little. Wait, are we talking about capturing another dragon to fight another dragon? No more small boys, Percy. No more. Do they look like townspeople? Any kids? I do want to maybe talk to Gilmore, though. As cynical as Percy is being right now, he's right. But it doesn't mean that Kashaw is going to think that it's any less important, and I'm sure he might not take it as a compliment if we ask him to be the messenger boy. Yeah, but do we know of any other dragons here? Let's talk to Kashaw. We go up and we talk to Kashaw. We need a big beast on Draconia. Yeah. See? I'll lend it to them for 100 years. We're basically doing a contract for free. If they lose, they don't lose anything either, right? But wouldn't the contract just go right back into cycle? They're used to having people die. I think Grog's getting antsy. Hit him in the nuts. What do you need a writing desk for? Yeah, how's the letter going? Yeah, actually. What? Kashaw? Yeah. We're going to be here the rest of the day, right? Druids. People. Wizards. Sorcerers. All right. Let's go to the Sun Tree. Oh, come on, man. Why are you doing this to me? (laughter) Fuck you, I hate you so much right now. (laughs) Uh-huh? I love drinks. So much. What kind of a drink? Yeah. Well... Look. You know. It's really complicated right now, and I'm trying this whole "allowing myself to feel things" thing. Oh man. I don't know how to respond to that. I'll see you on the other side. We'll put a pin on this one. Bye, Kash. And I cast it through the tree and I push him in. Yeah, he's gone. Sounded like he was under duress? Can I do an insight check? 15. The Den of Druja. Jaja. Shaun, are you doing okay? You look a little worn out. I could only imagine a barrier of this size of a construct can be quite taxing on one's physical energy. We should have a spread of our survival kits. Yeah, what was that Scarlet Prison you just mentioned, under the what now? I've never stolen anything! Shandal. Yeah. Maybe we shouldn't. It's a city that has no water. We shouldn't make waves. Jarett, was there still a control of water going on while you were there? Is there anything we should know about that? And Jarett, will you keep an eye on Gilmore for us? I think he's just working himself a bit much. Thank you. To market! Yeah, more water's good. Yeah, we've tapped them out there. Slowly. Very slowly. Oh yeah. I bust out some of my clothes from the Fire Ashari. Go lighter. Does his little sachet-- Well, I was going to say, does his sachet need a re-up of herbs? I thought you stuffed it with something. What's the decoration like in the room? Ooh, whispers. How are those Cowboys doing, Travis? Oh snap. She's learned from you well. He did say we would meet his family. Hi! Tal'Dorei? Can I do like a nature check or take note of what he said so I remember? Because that was vague. Do we have any more reason to be here? Or should we start heading off to Ank'Harel? I can mist us. I brought it today. Wait. Can that happen? Because we're mist. Sorry, I just spit all over you. I'm sorry. That's how mist form works. I don't think we'd evaporate. I think he's fucking with us. I don't think we'd evaporate. They fade into existence! I don't think we'll evaporate. Do we need anything else while we're here, before I do this? I mist us. Before I go, I say stay in school, kids. And then I mist. I was trying to inspire them! Sliming them! Follow traffic. Yeah, we're just sweating a little bit more. Do we condense a little bit? Turn into a low-lying fog? Never mind. Wind Walk, you said it was a day's journey, and we can travel faster by Wind Walking. I think we should be able to get there, right? Because we have a flying speed of 300 feet. An appropriate cloud height. Hundreds. A couple hundred feet. It's been five or six. Does there look like any patch of shrubs or a low point in the terrain? Cover. I don't think they'd take kindly to surprises. Yeah. I'm assuming that that's the Hand of Ord that we're looking at. No, he said the Hand of Ord is the name of the peacekeeping guards. In the mansion. So not really camping. We're glamping. Yeah, let's not mist down in the middle of a group. We're deciding how far. So 200 yards. And if we get caught, they're going to know we didn't sign in correctly. I don't see any trees, and those guards look heavily funded. That looks like expensive armor they're all wearing. Okay, the people who are camping, what do they look like? Pretty common folk, I'm assuming? Okay. Are we going to talk to any of them? I go in. Yeah, I think we're just strange. No one sees anything. You're using a luck? You are so walk of shaming right now. (laughter) Talk it out right now. I thought we were going into this one with honesty. Thought we agreed to that. We're ambassadors from Emon. Our normality is dishonesty, so technically we're switching it up. We're not honest, so let's try it for once. I feel like that's pretty compelling. (sighs) We have to be careful with our word choices with him. Oh, that's a really far stretch. The king. Merchant warrior? No, not that one? Who the fuck are we trying to see? What was the name of the district? Suncut Bazaar. Fight! Well, we should probably start with a tavern. People tend to know things in taverns. Is that in the Suncut Bazaar, or could we head that direction while we look? I'm desperately trying to commit every direction to memory. Do you spice?! Do there appear to be any fruit merchants? There's not many things, no. Can I go up to one of the fruit merchants? Apples? Oh wow. I was looking for something a little bit more exotic. Something native to this land. That was very descriptive. Thank you. How much do I owe you for this? Two silver. And how much, just for future reference, are the apples? One silver apiece. That's pretty steep. Don't worry about it. Here you go. I give her a little extra. I think I'm good, thank you. I toss her a gold. She's with me. And what was your name? Shubad? Keyleth. A pleasure. Thank you so much. Are we all there? I'd like to follow. Be pleased. He will know. He's a fortune teller, for Christ's sake. A merchant warrior. Missing. I guess. We need one of those leashes for him. I come over the earrings. Scanlan? Just making sure you're okay, wondering where you are. No biggie. Just checking in. Might be. Scanlan, stop panicking. I can hear you hyperventilating. Scanlan, not over the speakers! Not over the phone line! There's hookah! You've never tried hookah? The Earth Ashari are super into the hookah. It's really nice, yeah. We should try it! I thought that's what we just did with that other guy. Some call her a warrior merchant. Ilk? I was just about to ask her the same thing! Well, the Earth Ashari do, and the Fire Ashari sometimes. Yeah. I stayed with the Earth Ashari for a few months. You want to try? It's fun. It's very nice. It relaxes you. Oh, come on guys! We've got time! We never take time for ourselves. Come on! Just 15 minutes! 15 minutes. Please, Vex, pretty please! Scanlan! Let's get our own! We'll get our own little booth. Yes, I want to hear this story. Me, too! No, I am enjoying my hookah. Is this a split hose? We have a split hose. It's just tobacco, Scanlan. Actually, that's a good point. I do a few test puffs. Is it just tobacco? Is there something special about this hookah? It's nice! So okay, you don't want to inhale all at once. It's more like flavor thing. Like a cigar. Vax. Come on. Wow. This is cute, actually. This is adorable. I hand him some water from my pouch. Just a little dry. Does that get to come with us, or is it bottle service? Because if this is bottle service, we're here for the night. Yeah, yeah. Grog, I think this bottle's more well-armored than we are. I thought this was an open tent-commune thing. Fill me up. Oh wait, you want me to go first? How is it? I slap him. I take a sip. I want to know! I take a sip. (slurring) Oh holy shit. MARISHA and (laughs) Yeah! (affirmative grunt) (affirmative grunt) (dissenting grunt) (non-committal grunt) (laughter) I lean on Vax a little bit. (laughing) This is everything I wanted. Aw. I see why you're doing that. With disadvantage? 17. Oh shit. We have a name! Goddamn it. So what type of people like to participate in these duels? Less than a Bowl of Judgment? Bowl of Wheaties. Wow. I feel like that's not going to work. I have a feeling that... yeah. Just to meet with her? That's not bad. Did you put in there that it had to be prompt? That it had to be prompt? Does he still have some drink in front of him? Oh, never mind. I'm with Vex. Have fun! Come on, Percy. Roll something good. That's better! Be pleased. Percy, what's that? Well. Can I do a check on the other two potions to see with my potion knowledge? My potion sense? Not bad. Just straight intelligence? 15. I'd have to look at it. Not familiar, sorry. That looks like a health potion, though. Healthy. Yes? Oh, you know-- Maybe you'll come to it at the end of being in Ank'Harel. Plus, the best way to see a new city is to walk, you guys! Continent of Tal'Dorei, city of Emon. It concerns the fate of the world. Which one? 23. No, 24. Gameshega? MATT, LAURA, and Gameshega? MATT and Yeah. Two weeks. Yes, that was a weird day.
