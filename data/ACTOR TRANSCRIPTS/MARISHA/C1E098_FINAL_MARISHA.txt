It's like Cooking Mama. Are we talking about next week? That's a big one. You won't be there to put my face in lava this time! I'll just have myself to do that. Are you going to bring back Scanlan? My mother has never been so proud of me. I was questioning myself, I was like there was no way something was called the Grumpy Lily. Did you mention us or anything else? So you didn't even offer up the information? There's no such thing as family problems being okay for forever. Grog! What exactly is your duty that you are feeling inclined towards? Damn it, Grog! Yeah! Maybe she's also a badass! That's not a problem. Yeah, but Grog does bring up a point that I was trying to make before he started laughing when I said "duty." (giggles) But what, are you committed to keeping your family around? You said you were compelled and you felt like you had a duty but then you immediately started talking about-- Tearing your family apart? And stopping them? If there's one thing I understand, it's giving your life to a cause. No. Dedicating. Time is a gift, I would say. So dedicating that gift is, it's a big thing, but I hope you believe in it. We believe in you. You don't care! Bottle of wine! She's awesome! I thought you said that was because of the aloe vera. Right, yeah. Salt air is better for you. Life needs moisture to live. It's way smarter-sounding. Do you have a shiraz? I was just wondering if you had any imports. Do you have a red wine? Let's just take them all. I mean we have-- Oh, it's fine. That's true, look at Pike's grandpa. Can I take the bread crumbs from the corner and throw it down so the rats could have it? Yeah, I'll hang with Grog and Pike. Okay, wait, before we go any further. Wait. Do I have to be doing a short rest to do the Inspiring Leader thing? Oh, never mind. I'm new to the being an inspiring leader thing. I should've done that at the bar. Okay, okay. As we walk I'll be like You know what, guys? I've had a lot of time to think over the year that we've been away-- And I feel like we've grown so much as people, and you guys are family. You're a family to me. And I go on for a while. Do you guys remember that time in Stillben? When we very first met, and we all didn't really like each other, and Grog, I don't think you understood me for a while. Yeah, that's fine. That's fair. Hey Grog, do you remember that one time-- Do you remember that time-- I think it was the first time I made you laugh, and I turned into an earth elemental, and then pretended to do an "I'm going down the stairs" thing through the floor? Yeah, I just remembered that the other day, and I just love you guys so much, you know? Yeah, I don't think you were around yet. But I love you so much! Oh yeah, you want to mock until you realize you get your hit points! And I love you guys. I love you guys so much. Not showing your sensitivity? Do you have a shiraz? I like these people! And then the defenders go to another in case shit goes bad. I like that. Vex, Tary, I feel like you guys are good talkers. I'll sit with Grog and Pike. Write that shit down. Can Keyleth get up and walk past the diplomats' table and run my hands-- Oh, we're at the same table now? Oh, so we scootched together? Okay, then I'm just going to lean into Vex and give her an Enhance Ability on her charisma. You get advantage-- Yeah. On checks. Her cleavage gets a little nicer. Hey, who's the Change-Bringer? Does anyone know? I feel like this drink is inspired. Can I do a check to see? Aw, I'm not good at this. Pike, you know gods! Oh, please. I have no idea. I definitely have zero idea. Oh. Yeah, of course we knew that. It just sounded fancy. Mimic Vex. I'm following your lead. Look at you! Need to make some more money. What are you learning about the man by what he drinks? Oh, really? They didn't give you the same cup? I'm so bored. I scoot with Grog. I get up with Grog, too. Oh, I have to pee. Do you want to go pee? Yeah, I start paying attention to the room as well, with Grog. You could marry the girl or we could go kill an ancient being. Yeah! You are very skilled in hiring talented mercenaries. That might be your strongest suit. Vax says yes, and so do I! Aye! I think we've all risked our lives for each other at one point and another, so it's your turn, Tary. Welcome to the family. Okay. To Camilla! You'll win it if you spell it right. I could scry on the area if I knew enough about it. That's fine. It's 120 miles. Yep. I'm pretty fresh. All right, before we leave, is there any type of research we should potentially do? I mean, just in case there's maybe some ancient deity that rules over the forest of Herethis and some sort of goddess? Fuck it, let's go. Trial run. Well, once again-- Duty. (laughter) That we gave Scanlan. But he hasn't. Yeah, maybe he threw it into the ocean for all we know. It would be a massively dickish move. And do what? Convince him to come back? See if he's okay? Ask him how his year's been? Yeah, you didn't want me to even scry on him and now we're talking about just popping in on him? I feel like there's a weird crossing of the lines. Oh man, Grog. You guilted me very hard on that. You made me feel kind of shitty. No, you kind of got it right. Just go with it. TALIESIN and And no one has heard from him at all over the course of the year? She's messing with you. That's kind of cute. Yeah, what time is it? What do you mean by-- Finale! Yeah. Well, we can float down. And when you mean seared, like acid? Or like heat? I'll start setting up camp. Five? Yeah, it's a dick. That could be a glabrezu, which fucking killed you the first time. They have pincers. I don't know. Skittering beasts? The smaller one? Does it sound like anything we have encountered? A nature check? Would I have an advantage with my little book? 19? An ankheg? So they snatch cattle-- Oh my god, you guys. Perfect opportunity! LIAM and Yeah, let's have a Heroes' Feast, which-- okay, hang on, let me check here. I can do a Heroes' Feast. Okay, but my Wind Walk-- I already Wind Walked, so I can do a Heroes' Feast at a higher level. I also want to do a 5th-level Commune with Nature. What should I ask? What should I ask that we don't already know? Well, I can see in a two-, three-mile radius. I was thinking that. Okay. First and foremost, influences from other planes of existence. Okay. Planar, long dormant. Okay, so something planar. Yeah, that was our first fight. No, I can, it's a terrain question, so terrain. Yeah. How deep does this mine go? Is. I think I can, right? Can I sense the location of where--? Yeah. 400 meters and the entity lies at the bottom. Yeah, we're gods! It's only a little bit more than 1000 feet. Now I know Looney Tune physics doesn't work in this world. Always Keyteor. It lies at the bottom. Ankhegs. Can I get a sense of how many and whereabouts the ankhegs are? How many? That's a problem. About how many? Do I know about how many there are? Sensing their skittering movements under the surface. Because this is a three-mile radius, right? There's a lot. So does it have anything to do with this? No. I'm bad at this! (groans) Are you serious? Shut up! Can I Druidcraft some web hammocks? Look, I really like elaborate tree houses. I can have a rope bridge here. I'll pass. We'll just sleep with the ones we have or whatever Heroes' Feast. Is this including or not including the chalice that Grog gave to Vex earlier to drink out of? It's got Michael's. Michael's crafts. How do you turn it off? Cover it in blankets. Yeah 2d10, yeah? (gasps) Ooh! Wait, yeah! Ooh, that's amazing! It's a nine and a ten! But this is going to be a long rest? But then at the top of the morning, I can give us another speech. Do I have to do it? Fuck you, Travis. Fuck you. Right, I can do an interpretive dance. A laser light show. With fireflies. It's like in a Disney Imagineer show. All right, well, it's a speech. So in the top of the morning. LAURA and That's great, because one can only bullshit so much in a four-hour fucking game. I talk about the smell of our breakfast. It's bacon in the morning. And taste and smell the fleshy essence of the pork. No, bacon is definitely worth fighting for. Bacon is worth fighting for, and when we kill that celestial baby we will have the godliest bacon one could ever imagine. She's not a great talker and has never been one. Just want to point that out. You guys all know this. That's the one that Kerr bear took. LIAM and Yeah, I'm all right. I'll light my hands on fire so that Vex can light her arrows on fire. They'll be 400 meters down. I could theoretically drop some awesome Fireballs on their face, potentially. I don't know. That's a weird magic question. If I drop a Fireball, how long it'll go-- Will it keep going? But I could Keyteor to the bottom. Yep, advantages to both. I rolled 19, but then you get an additional 17 because my weird speech about bacon. Look, it was inspired, okay? I'm not wrong. Bacon has saved many a people. I mean, I have a few Daylight spells. I'm down with that mini nuke. It extends a lot of our magical ranges, unless I want to Keyteor down. There are definitely a lot of trees, yeah. Well, I can Polymorph him. Hang on. Before we go, there's a few things I want to do. Let me double-check-- I don't want to be a dumbass. Hang on. Wait. I might need the book. Okay, one of the things I want to do is I want to use my staff to create an air elemental? So I want to take a minute to use my Spire to conjure an air elemental. What? I'm going to conjure an air elemental, and then I'm going to go over to Grog and I'm going to give him a big hug and say, for the next hour, no one can keep a hold of you. And I'm going to give him Freedom of Movement. You can't be grappled. You're also unaffected by difficult terrain. And spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained. You're parkour. Because I feel like you've been restrained a lot. Yes. I know. I'm wondering if I should ahead and go elemental, but I can't cast. Can I get on the carpet? Is there room? Did you cast Pass Without a Trace? 37. I know. Primordial? I can also just cast Daylight, by the by. Oh, that's good! Oh shit. Holy shit. 19. That's cool. Sick. 17. Okay. I'm going to take and control my air elemental and send him over. 42. So I have to get over-- I have advantage on these. What's 17 plus four? Thank you, Gil! All right. So (boom) I send him over with my staff. It has 90-feet fly speed. And he's going to go ahead and do a Whirlwind. The creatures in his space have to make a DC 13 strength saving throw. That's what I hoped. They take 3d8 plus two bludgeoning damage. Oh, that's nasty. 12 plus seven is 19 plus two, so 21. And they are flung up to 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked prone. And are knocked prone. Do I still have line of sight? Yeah, I'm going to get off the carpet and walk over just to where I have line of sight. Even though my mantle allows me to ignore the penalties of dangerous weather effects? I'm a warcaster, though, man! Because that's eight, so I just have to get over a ten, right? Rolled a 13. Okay. Can I move over to where I have line of sight? Okay, can I do Blight? I think my spell level, so 20. 8d8. No, fail. One, two, three, four. Give me two more. One more, and another. Give me a d8. Okay. No, on elementals. Four, five, nine, 14, plus eight is 22, plus four is 26, plus two is 28. 28 Blight damage. Fucking lava! That's not bad. 19. No, 18? I turn to everyone behind me and I go, aw, fuck! It's fine. All right. On my elemental? Yeah, 13 plus my constitution, right? Yeah, I'm good. That's why I cast it on him, man. Oh, fuck. One of these guys. What? A wall? Wait, you're buried, too? I'm under the wall, right? Yeah, my air elemental is there. What do you mean? I'm underground, right? (growls) I'm going to go earth elemental. Do I have enough movement to earthglide to them? I think 60, earthglide? Okay, can I come up from underground, grab them, and then beat them into the ground? That's cocked. Natural 20 on that one, and a four on a second one, which is 12. And then you double the 2d8. Six doubled, which is 12, plus five doubled, which is ten, so that's 22. I know. Just the dice is 22, plus five. So 27. And I just want to hold onto it and be like, yo! Yo, air elemental! And then let my air elemental come over and do its thing. Double slam attack. Slam attack. No, I'm going to do a multi attack. Two slam attacks. So 2d8 plus eight, once again. That's an 18 and a 17. Plus eight. Yeah, so 26 and 25. Which is 3d8 plus two. So the first one, oh! Six, seven, eight, plus seven, which is 15. For the first one, 15 plus two. 17. And then the second one is eight, plus two fives, which is 18 plus two, so 20. Constitution that's part of my physical stats as being an elemental, correct? It's con, strength, and dex. Never mind. Yeah. 15. There's no way. Unless I roll a nat 20? They just do their own thing if you fail. I rolled a 19. Can I not fade it after this? Oh, I can drop concentration on it and then it will go away, right? To be fair, didn't it also get affected by the blast? I rolled a 13, plus two, so 15. It only has 90 hit points, so it's fine, guys! It's fine. Yeah, glitter gets everywhere. I run over to Grog. I'm still an elemental, yeah? I am still an elemental. Where is he? You point. I earthglide and I find him. And I can do double damage to structures. Can I beat him out? I don't want to kill him by suffocating. I go over to the glitter and I get some of my potion bottles from my alchemy to-- Oh, I'm actually good at this. I try and harvest some, sweep some glitter. Okay, so I get everybody in the middle. Is everyone ready? What do you mean, you need help? I go (boom) and I pull Grog through. Oh, the carpet. I take a few minutes as my earth elemental self to beast through... I can do double damage to structures. Oh, okay. Go get the carpet. Oh, we're doing damage as we fly out. Oh, are we just riding up? Broom and carpet? Broom and carpet. I can. Do we need to? On the top of my spire I cast Daylight. Are they attracted to the Daylight? Lower than a 13? Can I do a Wind Wall to protect us from around us? Are we doing one more round? If we are, I will prep my Wind Wall spell to encompass us for one more round. I'm good. 21. 21. Yeah, and I can drop a Fireball on there. Yeah, and I'll throw a Fireball. Burn the place down. Extermination. That was awesome! I am going to be looking at all of my spells. What? Why? I'm going for the machete! I love you! (sizzling) Then Pike did it to me immediately the next round. I love you! (sizzling) Yes, it was.
