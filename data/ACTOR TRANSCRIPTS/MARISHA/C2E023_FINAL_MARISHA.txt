It feels like the longest walk yet. (laughter) Oh! It's Darragh! I did almost die, which was pretty awesome. Do we have any more boom-boom sticks? He almost killed me and definitely killed our guide. Sounds fun. Wait, what do you mean by "those people"? Do you know a lot of people who throw dynamite in houses? He definitely has 100 gold on him. Just saying. Possibly so much more. I'll take up the rear. You get a gold star, very good! Can I do a scan and look around? Can I do a scan and see if I see anybody responsible for making the vines move? Yeah, man, it's pretty bad. Eight. Nope, ten. Still getting used to my stats. What, no! It's good jerky! Let's just run! We're just going to go. Aww, feeding the plants. Should we do a circle, surround the perimeter, just in case? Hiding in that tree. Do we go steal stuff and bounce? Wait, is Frumpkin dead? Not to be insensitive. Oh, hey buddy. Sorry. Yeah, maybe we send Frumpkin first. Sure. I'll hold a throwing star. Like, you throw a Fireball and make it go? Oh my God! It'll look really cool when you're running away from it, though, when it's exploding. And you're within 30 feet, right? That was the coolest! You think? 14. A fjour by Fjord. They do normally, though. I'm going to move up my speed pretty far, because I think I have to be within 20 feet for these darts. I'm not! I have throwing darts that only go 20 feet, and I'm a melee fighter, man! Have you met Beau? Oh right, okay. First attack. 19. On the first one. We celebrated too soon. A natural 20 and a seven! So 14. That sucks. Four damage. I'm going to spend a ki point-- Like a rock in his face! Like a pebble! I'm going to use a ki point to do Patient Defense. Did I go my full speed? Can I move back a little? One more, that's good. Making up for last week! Ha ha ha! Does my Patient Defense do anything here? 16. Nine. Not as much as Yasha. I look at Yasha. Yeah? I pull out my oil flask and I undo it and I douse him with oil, power-of-Christ-compels-you style. Eight. That didn't go as planned. Sorry. Yeah, I'm going to step back. Yeah, a little bit more. I'm going to go behind that tree there. Yep, that's fine. Maybe there's some oil flecks on him. Do better than me! Damn it! We still would have sucked. That would have been really cool in theory. Heavy metal lollipop. Run away! Oh no! Fjord, run! Two birds, Molly. I like it. I know, it's so begrudgingly. I join Nott in looking for the gold. I'm pretty fucking fast. I'm pretty damn fast. The fuck? Time is weird for Fjord. Is it still Slowed? You just saved Fjord. Yeah, it was. It had another one? If it's at its turn, and now we're back at the round so it's going to have another turn immediately? Hold! Are the two of you going to try and drag? Or do you want to try and attack and Yasha and I can drag? All right, I'm going to run up, since I know me and Yasha are together. I'm going to cast Step of the Wind, to give myself double movement, or use a ki point. I'm trying to get to Fjord. Well, I would have gone a straight way, but yeah. Step of the Wind, I have double movement. Okay. And I'm going to grab onto him and I'm going to turn to Yasha and I'm going to say, Help me, and I'm going to pull when she gets up to it. I'm going to pull when she gets up. I'm going to help her pull him out. I want to assist her, though. Can we get him further if I assist? That was the whole point of me doing that. Okay. If not, if she can handle him, then. Okay. Kill him, kill him. Oh shit, Caleb. Beau gets up, seeing Caleb a little bit messed up, and I'm going to go up to him and I'm going to grab him and be like let's take a walk. That's fine. I'm walking with him a little bit, slowly. Quarter of what we came back for, but sure! Where's Febron's nasty body? I hand him one skin and I say Here, this one's water. This one's booze. Take the water and I pour it out on one of my sashes and dab off his forehead a little bit. You all right? Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Yeah, let's do that. There's a campfire over there that Yasha and I made with the oil and the torch that we threw. It's already done. Let's go sit by that. Can I get my oil flask back too? Yeah, I imagine we wandered back. He's great. Yeah. I feel like those two aren't mutually exclusive or anything, but yeah. All right. Is there another inn, other than that bougie, terrible, underground situation? That was pretty bougie. When you want to try and seem fancy, but it's a little ostentatious. Yeah, it's short for bourgeois, which is super ostentatious. That's ostentatious. Safe house cleared? Jester's that person who keeps trying to record the voicemail and gets cut off. Aw, re-record, one more time! Wait, we're in the tavern? Can I pull and grab my staff a little bit? Oh my god, Horris! Oh, he's not dead! Yeah, this place sucks. He's fine. He was sitting pretty next to the other diplomats of the town. Did you see that crazy army ride by? There was a lot of horses. A lot. Where are you staying right now? How are rooms there? Are they underground and filled with water and mold? The Drowned Nest? Do they have a tavern at The Drowned Nest? Me too. Let's go check out The Drowned Nest, shall we? There is a better place than the Keystone Pub. We head to The Drowned Nest. We'll take them all. He's very dapper. He touches the hearts of all of us. Where would we be without Fjord? Well, I'm going to go get a drink. Yeah, I'll go get a table. Does someone want to tuck Kiri in? The Keystone Pub. We paid way too much money to have him store our horses. I have validation, it's okay. Yeah, she hates us. We have been wanting to buy a bar. Yeah, this town sucks. Were you being intimidating? I've seen that Tumblr post. Maybe next time if you write down the words, so you can know which are the most important words. It is what you said! We do need a valet ticket. Did we get a valet ticket? Look, if we don't have one, you have to pay full price if you lose it. Yeah, the rest of us. Hey, will you take Kiri with you? All right. Oh my god, that's so cute. She's our new brand mascot. As we walk there, I, to the rest of these four, three, say-- no! You're not there. To these two, say, all right, guys. Real talk. What are we going to do with Kiri? We can't keep her with us. She's going to die. Bloody. Horribly. Brutally. You're going to be real sad about it. So we got to let her go. No, we can't let her go. But I'm saying we have to let her go from our group. Somewhere safe. Can you do that? Do you need to know who her parents are? No, they got separated. But we don't know yet. I think we need to get her out of this swamp, because this place is terrible. And I wouldn't want to live here. I'm not going to subject a poor little child bird to that. You're right! She could grow up and run this town. Oh my god, she's her own mob boss. I like that. I have high hopes for her. Yeah. Okay. I think that'd be good. We'll start there. Put a pin in this for now. I'll throw in for it. I'll throw in 25 gold. Oh, I mean-- I'm pulling a Grog. I thought you said it was going to cost an extra 50 on top. I'm sorry. Yeah, give us that money. Deal! What's the manhood thing? TRAVIS and Ah. We're having our own story over here. With advantage. Murdering people in their sleep. Ugh. I think I'm getting athlete's foot from all the moisture in my shoes from this place. Really? It's so itchy. Ugh. Really? What does that mean? Where's the map? Or we can go through Hupperdook. Wait, is in where? Rexxentrum? I'm just going to say, I've heard some pretty crazy stories through the grapevine about what goes on in Hupperdook. Are you challenging me? So, all right. City's got a lot of gnomes, and they're filled with industry, and they work all the time. But at night, they party. Work hard, party hard. It's what that city's all about. I don't know about the mushroom houses thing, but I've heard some crazy-- they have ragers every night. No. Not at all. I'm just saying, I've had some shady friends. I've had some shady friends. I think they have one of the highest imports and exports for illicit substances. I don't know. That's just what I've heard. To hewe? To the cwosswoads? What's in the cwosswoads? Is it a village? We don't know. Yes! How do you know which diamonds are our diamonds? But don't you need them for the spell? Do we have a specific diamond pocket that, if we go down, you go in our diamond pocket? And whenever we steal jewelry off of people, maybe we keep it instead of selling it. Do you have any spells that use rubies or emeralds? What about you, Caleb? But this doesn't go away? Could you teach her how to do the spinny thing? The Traveler is my co-pilot, it's okay. He's leading the way. It's American Gothic, but as birds. Did we ever find anything out about the Sending thing? How did that go? That's what I want to know about first. This bird's going to die. Who are you talking to? Are you talking to me? Okay. That would be weird if I walked up to you and said, "Did you want me to rub his ankles?" No, I've noticed that. Can he still hear us, or can he only hear the cat? Okay. What if I poke his ankles? That's cool. You guys know tents. I want a bone necklace, but do you guys recognize any of these tent colors? I want some bone jewelry! I walk off that way. Yeah, you mentioned the tent thing. That's not a bad idea. Do you have any bracelets? A goblin took my jade one. Fjord, does this look like a little much? This feels like it doesn't go with my outfit. Yeah, does it feel out of place? Oh, it's just leather? Yeah. Where do these bones come from? Volves? Wolves, wolves. I buy the bone bracelet, throw her money, and say thanks! And walk off. No. Here. How big are they? Are they four-person sleepers? 20 square foot is pretty big. A little bubble? I toss Percy ten gold to reimburse him a little bit. Was it Percy the time before too? We want the Hupperdook one. What? What's ahead? Did you party any? Quick rager after the kids were asleep? Trafficking kids? Wait. Yeah, Nogvurot is right where we're going. We're going past Shady... Shadycreek. But they're next-doorsies. Yeah. On the way back. On the way back. Her bad. Did you see anything? Because I don't see anything. (laughter) Your eyes are like the swamp. Super muddy. One's like the swamp, one's like the sky. Yeah. It's very like, very diverse biodomes in your eyes. (laughs) Biodomes, you know? You know, like-- Yeah. Waterworld. Let's go. Yeah. It's natural. It's in my blood. It's in my blood, man. It's all a ruse. I already hate him. Crocs? Is he wearing Crocs? (groans) No! Spread and flank? Spread and flank? 14. I'm going to move on the opposite side of where Nott is and do like a quick runaround and try and flank. Taking out the closest guy that's to me. The one who's yelling? I'm cracking the one on the head. Does he see me? I'm trying to do this stealthily. Okay, while his attention is diverted, I'm going to come up behind and try and do a crack. Go to sleep, go to sleep. Do I have advantage on this or anything? 16. Okay. That's 12 damage, and I'm going to do stunning blow. Stunning Strike. Is that a ki thing? I'm going to cover his mouth and lay him down in the grass, and do another blow to his temple to try and knock him out. Nope, just knock him unconscious. Do I roll? Natural 20! Thanks, Gil. (shushing) Lay him down in the grass. As I'm laying in the grass with the guy who I knocked unconscious, I'm going to pat down his body. Natural 20 again! That's two 20s in a row! Counter Wil Wheaton! Over here is our safe haven from that. (singing) Hey, big spender! As they all leave, Beau peeks her head out of the grass and goes I knocked one unconscious, and I don't know what to do with him now. I could've let him go, but I didn't want to say anything in front of everybody because I started feeling bad once you guys felt bad. I take this guy's green mask, and his pants, and I give his pants to Jester. Oh no! (thud) Oh, fuck! Sorry, it was a reflex! Your friend is-- They're bad friends. Okay. I try to lay him down gently. I turn him on his side. I already took seven silver. These guys sucked. Hey, Jester. What if we take him and we pose him, and we put a drawing around him just in case anybody else finds him, and maybe they think there's something wrong with this guy? A sign? I don't know. I was trying to be jovial, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have tried that. That's good. Let's do that. It's a Florida convertible. I told you it's a city of industry. Well, that happens at nightfall. I think mostly gnomes, but I'm pretty sure there are other people. I don't know. I've never been here. I've only heard stories. What time of day is it? (quietly) I think so. I do like alliteracy. Alliteracy. I like unlearnt folks. And when you say "war machines," how do you mean? 14. (sing-songy) Don't fuck me, Gil. Fucked me pretty hard. That's three. Can I use my mystical erudition to get an advantage on history checks? Deciding it now. At all. Nine. This scarred pot-marked line? Okay. So it's not new. Okay. Self-deprecation? Oh, honesty. I hear you people like to get in trouble here at Hupperdook. That's like 400. Wow. Amazing. That's like 800. Crazy. Do we have this tourism look to us? We should get some fanny packs. Oh my god. You don't know what's in there. Keep pulling stuff out. How much? What do you want? What? She just asked to fuck with a friend. Yes? That's true. I nod back. Hmm, yeah. Oh my god, it's a condo. It's a condo complex. Where do the best parties happen? Supervise what? You offered, though. Okay. Did you get fired? What? I just want to know. Yeah, you gave her information, so maybe she'll give us some. Did you get fired? Suspended? Undecided major. I like it. What? This city's awesome! (singing) Orlando! Orlando!
