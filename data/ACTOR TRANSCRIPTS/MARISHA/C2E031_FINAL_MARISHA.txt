That hat has puka shells on it. (singing) D&D Beyond. We were pretty loopy. Sleeves are bullshit! Everyone loved the dad hats. I was wearing it today when I was working. It's like riding a bike. Oh, so good. To be fair, I got a few gigs that way, by doing a few character shots. Have what? They're from Norse Foundry. Plain beeswax. Are you going to Pumat's? Guys, let's all go shopping! We just got money! I'm coming. Okay. Yeah. I want to go to Pumat. I have such a clear picture in my head, now that we've built it. But the aesthetic. We do always seem to come around 400pm, right when the sun is coming in the window. Pumat III, this is Caduceus. What are we talking about? Yeah. I'm hungry, so. Ugh, god, no more small talk! You still have those bracers? Yeah, what's up with those bracers? Have they come down in price? They've been sitting on a shelf for six weeks. So, you know. You know what, Jester? All right. What do they do again? Can you explain one more time? What? Whose side are you on, here? Right, so if anything, he should give me a bargain. You threw him off, Jester. Look, we might be purchasing a few things, so why don't we wait and see what all ends up on the counter and then we'll come back. Can I look at it? Can I touch it? Girth. Yeah. What's the turnaround-- what? Yeah, me too. I agree with Jester here. That's so 1994 of you! I really liked the candy thing, by the way. Maybe they can just decorate it to look like candy. Oh, craft night! Michael's had a stationery sale! Well, here's the deal, Pumat. What was that you said five or so minutes ago about us being your number one customers? Come on! Get it! That's good! Yeah, that's about it. I'll take those bracers. Yeah. Costs? I'm taking just 25 gold off of my bracers. No. Give me them bracers! We got a rebate, 100 gold! Oh, so we're-- Okay, we're good. 25 gold. Feels so good! Feels like real shopping; I get a shopping high! Cathartic! Do they look cool? Do they, like, go with the outfit, though? Yeah? Dope. Yeah. I'm going back probably tomorrow, next day, something like that. I was thinking like an extended weekend. Like a Friday-to-Monday, four-days-three-nights type of thing, if you're down. You don't have to stay the whole time, but that's what I'm going to do. You can do whatever the fuck you want. I'm not your fucking babysitter. Just want to get that out there. I typed in the bracers and they showed up with an image. That's in D&D Beyond. (singing) D&D Beyond. (whispering) Russell Crowe! (laughter) That's still overpriced for garlic. She just charged two gold for garlic. It's all bullshit. Oh shit. He's going on a walkabout. 'Sup, man! You ready for this monk retreat? Monk retreat! Let's go. No one ever cares about books this much. It's weird. I ask around and see if Dairon is there. Oh. Hi. What? She said she'd be back within a month, that she was just checking out the front lines at Bladegarden. You sent her behind enemy lines? Just hoping to check in with her and catch up on some coaching. Do I know Tubo? Is he an expositor? Hmm. Yeah, all right. Yeah, you too. That's me. Yeah, I mean-- Okay. Also, I got this guy with me. Can he get a room and a library pass? Zeenoth, Caleb. Caleb, Zeenoth. Mm-hmm. Okay. And then what happens? Yeah, all right. What?! I look at Caleb across the library. Okay, what am I trying to learn? Is there any type of history on families of Wildemount, or any type of underground trade going on? Family trees? Connections? Dope. Ghost puncher. Sick. Okay. Is this Truth or Dare? Is there a dare option? Then it's not Truth or Dare. You know Truth or Dare, right? 12. Not good. That's deeply accurate. 19 just hits. (groaning) I'm Wonder Woman! I'm not Wonder Woman. Can I do the thing? Spend a ki point. How many points of damage? Ten? No points of damage. Wait, I'm level six now, right? One point of damage. I lied. Okay. I can only do this thing once though, right? Or I can keep spending ki points to do that, right? I'll do it one more time. That's right, which I do. I do now. If I spend a ki point. One, two. So I will spend an extra reaction, then, to catch the other one. I rolled 11, so another one point of damage. And one more. 12. I turn to Tubo and I go Did you see that?! Oh. I don't get to kill those guys? Sorry, I'm sure you're really lovely people. Wait, what has-- Dairon's been talking about me? What has she been saying? Yeah. I get that a lot. I go find Caleb and I go Let's go! Our lord and savior. At least four stars on Grand Theft Auto. Oh no! Oh my god. That room with the candles! Oh my god. You guys, get out of this. Aw, shit. You know in Matrix 2, that overhead shot of all the agents filling into the center? That's what I imagine waves and waves of agents. (whispering) He's organizing Traveler Con. (laughter) Yeah. Nah, not a lot to report. Oh, yeah. Just, you know, I think I can punch ghosts now. Have you ever met a ghost that doesn't need punching? I just know if I saw a ghost, I would want to punch it. Ghosts are scary. You have met a ghost you didn't want to punch. Oh, you didn't get to see where we found this guy. It was definitely a cemetery. He was living in the middle of a cemetery. Okay, there's a difference? They're going to start putting up Winter Crest decorations in the stores. We have to start thinking about what we're going to get each other. Have you been there? And you don't know any of these people? Yeah. That definitely looks like it, too. Looks a lot like what sucked into your body. That was a weird night. An angry marble. You get the picture. How do you feel, actually? Do you feel it? Did you have any more visions when you were captured? Jesus. Thanks, Caduceus. Mm-hmm. Have you ever been to the Menagerie Coast? How far south have you been? Yeah, me neither. That's a plus, you guys! Going in the wintertime kind of sucks. Plus, further away from the frontlines in this war. I feel like her and Molly always had a connection. She always knew how to find us because she knew how to find Molly. What?! Your past self isn't allowed to laugh at current things. No reactions from Molly here. It's so great. Plus, it sounds like, gauging by this letter, someone's going to catch up with us sooner or later looking for whatever's inside of you. How we look at you sometimes? Like you're awesome? Like we're awestruck? That's accurate, yeah, I do look at you like that sometimes. So you want to find Sabian and hope that he has the answers? And you're sure this motherfucker was, like, sole sabotager? I mean, no offense or anything, but these sound like some crazy-ass fucking sailors. Fjord's angry marble in his chest. Oh! Disguise yourself? Oh, right. I mean, you don't want to give-- (sighs) I think, whatever gifts you've been given, they're natural and progressive. I mean, figure that out on your own first. You don't want to give them back, right? They're called gifts for a reason, right? It'd be rude to give them back. Kidney stones. Yeah. Me, too. I so want to meet your mom. (whispering) Thanks, Max. You're from Deastok? I mean-- Nott, it looks like the main road goes through Felderwin anyway. Yeah, but-- yep, you're right. Maybe that's-- that's a river. That's not a road. That's a real big-- But still. You basic! You know, I had that as Keyleth at later levels; I never fucking used it. We got super busy. It's a bad thing to have at later levels; it was better at lower levels. Invisi-cart. Didn't we have a couple more, too? Oh, that's right. Indisposed!
