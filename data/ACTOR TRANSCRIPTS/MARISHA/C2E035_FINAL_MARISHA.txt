Every Monday, 700pm on Twitch is where it premieres. Then, of course, you can immediately catch it on VOD on Twitch if you've subscribed to us on Critical Role's Twitch. Critical Role's Twitch! I don't know; I'm pulling a Sam Riegel, I'm adding graphics that aren't here. There's a graphic, right? Then it releases on Wednesdays on Critical Role's YouTube channel at 1000am, so if you do not catch it live or if you are not subscribed, you'll get it on Wednesday. She had to think about it, though. Wait, right or left? Fjord, is he with you? I'm pointing at the spectral guy. So I shouldn't kill him? You all right, man? Yeah, I'm still holding him down. I punch him. Shut up. Well... Questions, yeah. Just a conversation, maybe, first. Can you wait five minutes? I'm confused on the levels on what you're talking about what all you want, but I'm with it. Wait, do we do need from Algar--? You do want to kill Algar? You don't want to kill Algar. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll give earmuffs to Algar. Still have my knee in his face. What do we do with Algar? By the way? I think Algar's unconscious. He might be dead. Yeah. Should we-- Hey, Zsundie, real quick? Just seems like you were powering the entire city. How would we do that without you? To the guy? Did we need him? Was he useful, too? Yeah. We can do other things to make sure-- We do have one passage secured with Captain Adella. We could just tell Ed√©r-- what's his name? Algar. That's Pillars of Eternity. We could just tell Algar You have a new plot in life now and it's going to be to help Captain Adella. Do you want to disguise yourself, before we do this? I get back on top of Algar and I'm restraining him, pinning him down. I could use some healing. I do actually, thank you. How many points? Also, before we begin, I want to make sure that you know how serious we are in getting honesty from you. I take his head and I go whack-whack into the wall. I'm going to do Extort Truth on him, spend a ki point. He has to make a charisma saving throw. 14 is the DC. Fucking fuck! I do. What, to mine? Well then, I go I don't think you heard me. Whack-whack, and I'll try one more time. I try it again. Whack, whack. Real serious. Now, you're going to answer all these nice man's questions, okay? The Marquis, the... Oh, that guy, right? Lives in the palace guy? I dig that finger into his pressure point a little harder. Oh, right, charisma. 11. It puts the lotion on its skin. No, that's not how that shit works, man. (laughs) So badass! Man, that sounds like a fine idea, Algar, doesn't it? Oh, man. You look like a Jorge. Algar, you're going to be very helpful when it comes to making sure Algar knows who to talk to and the right things to say to get us out, right? Oh, I'm sorry, Jorge. The whole eastern seaboard is shut down. Technology, yeah! Oh, I know, it's so obnoxious when someone has their hands on you and you don't want it, isn't it? Okay, let's go. (laughter) Well, now he's right-handed. Ooh. Hmm. The weather's kind. Seize the moment. Maybe our tortle friend here can leave a little note in your stead, says that you're moving on. Are there any favorite buzzwords of yours? Something that would sound like you? (laughing) A lodestar. Okay, we'll go. We'll meet up with you guys? Yeah! Yeah. Marquet is far. It's very far. There's Stilben. Which was on the coast? Marquet! Marquet it is. I'll sponsor that journey. Did we take the money that was on him? God, we're mean. Thanks, Deuce. It's just running around in terror. Technically we left. You three are here. I really feel like you could do something about this! Do you guys remember in Tomb Raider 2 the butler that you had? We're time jumping. Yeah! Yeah. I turn around and I look at the city. Do I notice... commerce? Does it look like things are slowing down? Well, that was a garbage roll. Seven. That's terrible. Do I see Merpol anywhere? Merpol, that guy that I flirted with. 11. Thank god. All right. We also wanted to check in to... Did we want to try and be at the docks at midnight? Yes. He hangs out at the docks at midnight, and does Marius know Sabian and Cadmus? The letter? I don't know. Orly said he likes to hang out around the docks at midnight to look for work or something. Sabian we've heard about through Orly, right? Through what? Yeah, but didn't we talk to like Captain Adella and someone else? Someone gave us the news-- That they were doing the Widow's Embrace thing and that they're pirates. That was through Adella, okay. Okay, okay, okay, sorry. Lavish Chateau. We'll go to the Lavish Chateau and we'll just walk by the tower on our way back to give it another look-see. I mean, kind of. We wanted to see if it changed, or if anything's different, or if we see a mysterious figure in a window. It's Yussa Errennis, right? Okay. Let's go to the Lavish Chateau? Like a short rest? Yeah! Yeah. Yeah. Oh man, I want to hear that story. Do you have any good embarrassing stories? Are we in mixed company? Right, right. Oh no! Oh yeah! Can I go check on Professor Thaddeus? Hey. Is my bird okay? Uh-huh. You didn't traumatize him, did you? Yeah, I know. I grab the food that I just took from my plate and I'm like, "Thaddeus, come. Thaddeus?" Fuck me. Fucking animals. Why did I do this? Oh no. Six. Fuck that die. I can't control him, you guys. He has a mind of his own. He's a free person. Oh, you've all seen an owl before, shut up! It'll be fine. Sorry. Yeah. How do you feel about owls? Are we going to go down to the docks? Yeah. I try-- Professor Thaddeus! You want to come? Fuck me. Just come to me, you dick. Ooh, that's a natural 19. 22. Yeah! Fucking-- (excited breathing) I mean, that's fucking right. Let's go. He's coming with us to the docks, I guess. Oh, we're trying to be inconspicuous? Right? Exactly. We were at the Wayfarer's Cove. Which is in the Restless Wharf. Yeah. Looks like someone that's waiting for a handoff if I've seen them. Apparently five gold is a great going rate. Yeah. Ooh, that's right! Ooh. Nine. Motherfuckers. Yeah. I was just thinking that. I think maybe a little bit of familiarity with some underground might help the situation. Okay. I'll go with you on that. How big is this ship? Is it like a ship or like--? Any iconography on the sail? Hey, Fjord? You've got that fancy armor that helps you float. Do you think maybe you could get underneath the docks? Overhear something? No splash, no splash! Ten points! Yes, yes! Yes, queen, yes! I turn to Caleb and I go There! I threw our engagement ring and our life and I fed it to the rabies dolphins! It's over, okay?! It's over! Deception with disadvantage. Okay, 11. My mom was right! I never should have gotten involved with you. (Tracy voice) Look, this is why! Every time I try to talk to you, you play with your toys. Hey, you know what? You piss off, okay? I've had a rough day. I just wanted to be by myself near the ocean! Hits. Hits. (whispering) Never. I'm going to Deflect Missiles. What do I have to roll for that? Hang on, sorry. It's reaction, damage minus 1d10 plus my monk level. It just happens, right? Right, but my monk level is-- Yeah, so I'm good. I'm going to spend a ki point to send it back at this guy. Yeah, this is happening. He's my rock. He's the only one who understands me. Okay, I'm attacking. Natural 20. I thought I got a d10. It's whatever the bolt is, back at him. Plus my dex? Weapon damage, plus my dex. Seven. Deflect Missiles. No, it's only a ki point when I send it back. Got you. I will do that. Yes, I do. It was seven damage, you said? I take one point of damage. I'm going to spend another ki point to send this one back, too. 17. Ah! Eight damage. Two at the guy who's closest to me. Hey, Caleb? They don't think I'm a dumb, drunk bitch. It didn't work. That this was going to be bad. Sorry, guys. Sorry. We had bad rolls on important things! It feels like we should have figured this out. It was. Things started moving quickly. We could grab Marius and try and get the fuck out. I'm going to add my boots. 16. Yeah, we'll see real fast. You, then Yasha? Yes, it is. I wasn't going to-- It's definitely for when your vajayjay itches. Sponsor us, Summer's Eve! He smells of lavender and vanilla. Yeah, can we load the latest save file? Can I try and like self-defense--defend Caleb? Yeah. Hits. Zero points of damage to me. I can't like-- You want to try to take out this guy in front of me first, with your sneak attack, or do you want me to lean in on him? The big guy that you're under. Well, I could try to take him out, if you want to try and go for someone else. I shouldn't try anything fancy, right? I'm going to go up to this guy. Uh-huh. I'm going to attack him. I don't know what to do. 12. Hmm, going to try again. Yeah, but I don't know what I want to do, though. Waiting for everybody else to run. 17. Fuck, I think I was actually using the wrong math on that last one, too, but that's okay. Okay. Fuck me, six damage. I'm going to try to Stunning Strike him. Cool, supes cool. Yes, I do. I'm going to-- I can always disengage and run; I'm fast as fuck-- spend another ki point to do Patient Defense and hold my ground. Everyone else, please run. Oh, that's so cute. Assassin's Creed. What? It was a drive-by fruiting. This guy's real beefy, though. Yeah, but we don't want to fight all of them. What are they burning, though? Yeah. (laughter) Just fucked my head even more. You just spiked their drinks, basically. What if we commandeered the ship? What if we don't commandeer the ship? Are we going in? How do we get Marius out? Do you have a situation? Okay. I'm going to run towards Marius. Got 45 speed. MATT You're not quite adjacent-- you're not quite up to him, but you're ten feet away from him. Yes. I got that in my extra monk level when I leveled up. Can I grab him and tackle him down behind these barrels? Can I try and drag him back? I do that. But like, why? Why are my rolls so garbage? Do I get advantage because he's incapacitated? Fucker. Okay, I grab him. Can I use my bonus action to try and drag him back? I do. Can I do Step of the Wind and then fucking move him back? Yeah. I'm going to come up behind him and grapple him and put my staff around his throat, making eye contact with everybody else. Yeah. I back up. Well. You know, okay. Well, you said grapple. Not a subtle person. That's my turn. I've got Marius! I've got Marius! Do I have three-quarters cover? Because I'm using him as a human shield? Misses. Do I get deflect missiles? Yes I do. Okay, 15. Yeah. Five plus my monk level plus dex, right? Oh, and it's also a 1d10; I just rolled a 1d8. Right. See, this is old, but it's-- or is it my proficiency bonus? Okay, I'm not a crazy person. It's not as good, but 13. Jester, help. No, I'm just-- I mean, I'm not-- I'm okay. Any assistance getting Marius out? Yeah, if you keep them away, Yasha and I can make it work. (explosions) Yeah. A bunch of refugees wanting safe passage. Everywhere, on every panel. I think it's you? Can she go, and then I assist on my turn? I'll do mine, since mine's also a plus six. 11 total. Motherfucking piece of shit. Why would you do that? We worked so hard to get him that far. It feels like we're really in battle now. I was about to do that, yeah. You go first. Are you going to go for the sail? You could go for the sail, potentially. If you could start it, I could maybe rip it. I don't know, I'm spitballing here. I don't know what to do. Okay, I'm going to run up and go after these two bowmen, I guess. Fuck me, what am I doing? I just roundhouse him to the face. Motherfucker! Ten. I haven't rolled above a five all night. Okay! Eight damage. Do I have enough-- can I get the other guy? I go Melee range, you can't do it! And then a 19? Big money. Okay! Nine. Die! Die! I turn to Marius and I say "The Gentleman sent us? Gentleman? You a Gentleman?" Really? Seven. Can I stand on top of the door? Do I have enough movement to do that? I want to tamp it down, stand my full weight on top of it. Okay. Jump, Jester, jump! Oh, we're all here. The guy who's definitely not here. Oh no! We swear we're not pirates! You're going the other way? Away from everybody else? We'll catch you upstream. Great. That's rad. I run over and I untie the boat from the thing. I undo the rope. Are we hitched to the dock with rope? And anchor? With a cleat, or whatever they're called? I work on that because I'm assuming the anchor is heavy. The anchor? Okay, that's opposite from what I said. I'm trying to undo-- do I also have time to get the anchor up? I will focus on untying and getting it off, and then I do the thing that you do where you push on the side of the dock, and I try and get us like (grunt of effort). I get it untied. The boat's untied. Yeah, they thought Vox Machina were assholes. The AC of wood! Yeah. (laughter) Just add B&E to the list. I only unfurled, so if Yasha can yank up that anchor, that'd be dope. Now we're ready to go. Please don't be a dumbass. Marius. He just made himself a giant target. "Wait!" Okay, I go over to the rope of the sail and I pull it tight-- and the jib-- I don't know. I do something, and I go, "Fjord!" "Fjord, how do I sail?!" "Fjord!" I still try-- I do what I think-- Tie that? Okay! Okay. Do the-- what's the jib? Do I jib or do I winch? Wait, why am I rolling-- which one? Pick one! I'm going to do jade, lucky jade, lucky jade. Okay, okay! That was good! 19 total. (accented) "We've caught the wind!" I've heard sailors say that. There's like a rudder, right? Nott, rudder, the boat! What are we doing? I can feel Travis's Dad disappointment, like radiating-- It's hot. Miss. I see Fjord bash his head against the wall and I go, you guys, I think Fjord's under some sort of influence magic! He's not himself! Then I yank the-- Tell me what to do! You motherfucker! I try and interpret what he says. Hoist the thing! He realized he was being dumb. He did that. He saved from the spell. Yeah, it interrupted that with the fight. Oh god. Help me, Yasha! Oh my god! Geriatric bathing. Fucking skinny dippers. What the fuck? Polar Bear Plunge. Is that his voice? Sounds so familiar. Man. Yasha. Where the fuck were you? Who are you? You are clearly Cad. Kill him. That's great! Which is? Who the fuck are you? You piece of shit! I know who he is! I'm asking him! Fucking piece of shit. No, we know! I'm saying you're a piece of shit! So many things. I did say that. I kind of did. I was like, Gentleman. He's a runner. Who were you supposed to deliver it to? Mysterious folk. Where were you supposed to drop it off? You knew where you were supposed to deliver it, so where were you supposed to deliver it? Squall Eater? I take a handkerchief and I shove it into his mouth, and tie that around too. To be fair, the goal was to just ask, and then it got out of hand. You guys, we own a ship! Oh yeah! (yelling) Professor Thaddeus! (hooting) Professor Thaddeus? I'm going to try to throw up some bait. (hooting) Okay, I'm going to roll big. I'm not going to roll big. I'm going to roll great. I had him with me. 19. Yeah, I imagine when I fought I was like, "Go, hang out." 19. He is. He's happy. He's happier that way. He was like me. He's not meant to be tied down. He's not dead. He's just running far away from me. Professor! Man, thanks for that. You keep presenting with stuff that we don't really want, but then we see it and we're like, "We need it!" Then we don't want it, like animals. Now we have a boat.
