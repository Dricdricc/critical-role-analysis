PSA. Yes, that's true. I'm technically at the end. This is on Chris, really. Yeah, it's going to be in Lancaster next year. Shirts! Did it trend on Twitter? That's where I saw it. Grog. I believe we can handle it. Let's go. Avoid the skeletons. What? Did you not just hear my father-- Do you have Pass Without a Trace, Vex? We also don't want to waste all of our abilities on undead. Why don't we just tread that way, and we'll see what happens. Did we already have it? Triple advantage. 28. I'm afraid if we engage, it could draw attention to an entire slew of what could be around. All right, Jesus Christ. Vex, you might be the most capable of this. Daggers. Who exactly is the patronage of your candle business? Who do you sell to? I'm so sorry. Things do tend to die around us a lot. You might get something even bigger. Oh, like candles for funerals? That's sad. We do have a lot of tragedy. We're trying to close this giant rift that we're walking into. Were they sisters? If you make magical candles, you must know a little bit of magic, correct? Okay. I don't know. I don't know if stealth is going to be a thing, going forward. It's a fire elemental? Would he be considered a primordial? Okay. I'm going to go fire elemental. Seeing it, I'm going to transform and go into my fire elemental. Is this the first time I've been fire elemental? Yeah, learned from Cerkonos, yeah. In fire elemental, just like-- That's what I'm going to go do. So I approach and I'm going to do the animal instinct thing and poof up and make myself a little big. Oh, it's running from me? Deuces. And I roll back. Are we-- wait. Are we in the fire plane yet? Oh, we're in the caldera. Okay. I'm going to say "Halt!" in Ignan. Which I'm assuming it speaks. I follow after it and I say, in the name of the guardians of this realm, you will stop! At which point I'm going to do a fire intimidation tactic. I'm going to do a fire radial thing. And I'm going to say, as the leader of this realm, as the Kaitaki of the Fire Nation, you will heed my word. No, that one fails me a lot. It does! Shut up, Travis. Natural 20! It doesn't matter who I serve, for I am above him. I am your master now. This is not your realm. Get back into the fire plane. Where you came from. Holy shit. I fly back over to them, still in fire elemental form-- And I'm like You guys! Did you see that! It was really crazy! Did you see? Did you see? They think I'm their leader! They think I'm their god! I chill out. I chill out, I can't revert back, though, guys, because I want to stay in this. I give them a fire thumbs-up. Yeah. I'm going to take off, leading in my fire elemental form, deeper towards the rift. Keeping my eye out for any elementals that might be escaping. I'll throw up a Skywrite. Or actually, as a fire elemental, can I just be like (fire flares) in fire elemental form? Can I send up a little bit like a flare? Fuck. I don't realize she's doing it. Hold for a second. And wait for Team Three's response? Right, there's a third team. Three teams, right? Oh! One, two, we were three. Okay, yeah. I feel like Helen Hunt in that moment in Twister. So these are all fire elementals. Should I continue-- Huh? Four. You brought him into this world. 16K and a sloth! Oh, shit. That was awesome. Okay. Work with me here. So here's what I want to do. I want to go low and dive into that lava pit in front of me. And I want to-- using the lava around me to rise out of the lava and look really scary and badass, and then I'm going to shout to the living elementals, I'm going to be like, hear my warning! I am your new master! Retreat to the Fire Plane or meet your imminent demise! This is your last chance. Thanks! Thanks, guys. And if you'd like to meet for coffee later I might be available. Okay. Okay. That's better than my persuasion. Let's do this one, that one rolled a one. Get out of here. Get out of here. 15? Away? That's cool. Okay. But that one's peacing out? Do I still have an action? I knocked one off the plank. Did I put fire resist on you? At the end of last game? So you take half damage. Nice! I rush that way and look for my other tribe. Can I see any of my other tribemates? That's better. That one keeps fucking me. What'd you say? Perception? 26. No, sorry, sorry. 24. Cow-tipper! This is coming out of the rift? Oh, and so this is a pool of lava that they're coming out of? Molten fire plane, more or less? I'm going to, and upon seeing this, drop my fire elemental form and I say oh shit, I have a feeling this is the 'him' they were talking about. And I have a feeling he's not going to believe that I'm the real new master. So there's that. 24. Can Keyleth do a quick ancillary action before shit happens? Jesus, sucking it up today. I'm seven, by the way. I know, I'll just... be back here... caboose. Yeah, nope. Not leading. Shitty initiative roll. There was planning. There was a thought process. (laughs) Yeah! Oh, wait, why did it go back? It's just fire. What is that? Is that guy and that guy within 30 feet of each other? It's hard to tell with the thing on it. A 30 foot long spell could hit both of them, correct? Okay. But this guy-- oh, damn it. What about this guy and this guy? They're within 30 feet, right? Actually, yeah, let me do that. I am going to cast a Tidal Wave right here and I'm going to go outward in this direction, and it's ten foot wide and 30 foot long, so let me back up a little bit out of it. Yeah. Yes. Since it's water, do they have disadvantage? Do they take more damage because it's water? It does 4d8 damage. Ooh, that's good. 12 plus eight is 20, plus another eight is 28. Math. It's 30 foot tall. And 30 feet long. Why didn't we switch to metric? Okay, I will! Oh! I'll scootch up a bit, start moving towards... That's good, that works. Oh my god, can we do that? Like a hamster ball. He tripped at the finish line! Here's a laser pointer if you need it. Oh, that was almost bad. You do! It's hot. It's really hot. Just keep going. Maybe the heat made you misfire. So we have these two assholes in front of us. Well, depends on the day. So, that guy is still alive too, yeah? I'm going to Tidal Wave again. Tidal Wave! Right here, this way, fucking with these two guys. It's really good, I'm warning you right now. Seven and seven is 14 plus another six, brings me to 20, plus eight, 28, again. That's what I had last time right? 28. And then technically in Tidal Wave it says the water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in the area within 30 feet of it. Can I use my bonus action-- Question. Can I theoretically cast a Grasping Vine coming out of the hellmouth? Fuck, never mind. Actually, no, that's not true. I will take my bonus Healing Word to toss another Healing Word, just 1st-level, over to Gern. So you heal eight points, Gern. Can I-- No, go, you first. Please, Gern. Yeah, it's a concentration spell. No, that's an attack. I can try. Can I do a Grasping Vine from the bottom underneath of him, and see if I can? Let me see how this goes first. That's as far as it goes? Can I do the vines from out of the portal? Halved. Can Keyleth run up, do I have an action? Great. Yes. Pew pew. Matching piercings. Keyleth throws up a Skywrite spell and says, we're taking the portal. Yes. I stand next to my father and join the rest of the druids. Am I a part of the people who could be included in the ritual too? Okay. I am going to cast a 7th-level Plane Shift to help smush it closed. 12. Oh, with advantage. 23 Do you have your Dimension Door? A door. I did Planar Binding, which technically really wasn't supposed to do what I just did-- Planar Shift, I mean, yes. 7th-level. We don't still have our fancy feast, do we? You have advantage on wisdom throws. I take a Grasping Vine from the edge and try and yank him back. I moved up, I moved up. I would be over there. Yeah, no, I already knew that. It's fine. You did good. You did good. I reach down and I help him on his feet. How bad are you? I Cure Wounds, level four. Thank you, Father. Oh. Okay. I hope I do not fail you, Father. How do you know that this is my destiny? Kaitiaki, father. Korren, If we should ever need you-- if I should ever need you, or the assistance of the Ashari, what is the best way to get hold of you? Which home? I can, yeah. Hey, thank you guys. Thanks for coming, for helping. Thank you, Scanlan. This isn't my homeland. I appreciate how well you know me after all these years. No, this is the Fire Ashari's camp. I'm an Air Ashari. You know what, Scanlan, that might be the most questions you've ever asked me about myself. I don't have one. I pick a tree that's big enough to fit all of our fat faces. Maybe we should rest.
