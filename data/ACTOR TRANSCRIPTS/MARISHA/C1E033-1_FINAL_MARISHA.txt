It's on the front page right now. Oh no. Don't look that up. It's like Critical Role's favorite things. MATT and Yes. So good. No! You can't have a plan B already. Ready? It's a Critmas sweater. This is escalating quickly. We each picked fanart. Thanks, Denny's. Because Fallout. This is the first time they're really focusing on female stormtroopers, so it's pretty cool. Christmas is just around the corner. Fucking vampires. Do you have a Dispel Magic on you right now? Oh my god, I do! I learned it. What if she's Lady Briarwood? Like what we were saying? That's what I'm most afraid of. Well, before we do that, let's see who she is. I did come prepared, though, to dispel magic. I learned it. I did. She will be able to feel it. She lied pretty well, too. You go talk to her. I'll be prepared. I stay next to Vex. Shoot your dagger? Now! I do it now! (laughter) Sorry, got a little squirrely on that one. What's Percy doing right now? Where's Percy? It's pretty good. Can I see if she's lying? Not great. It is a number. 16. Oh shit! She's a nervous laugher. One hand and then one on the bear, right? And then I peek out of the shadows and go, hi. (giggles) Feels like a trap. She wants her weapons. Where the more upper-class folk would live, I'm assuming? Sure. So hang on one second, real quick, he's dressed as a guard? I'm going to go ahead and cast Enhance Ability on you. For charisma. Oh, it only lasts for a minute? I'll do it. I'm going to enhance. In case we get busted. So you'll have advantage on persuasion rolls. Also, no one forget that we have Heroes' Feast. I'll wait outside and stand watch. Yeah, she is. It'd still be your place. They let her keep her room. Are there any wall sconces around? Torch wall sconces on the outside? That's a really good roll. Yeah. Ahead of schedule? I'm sorry. Hi. By the way, I'm Keyleth. We haven't really talked yet. What schedule were you trying to keep? What was the deadline? What exactly does it do? A name. Give us a name, girl. They're going to destroy this fucking city. They're going to-- yeah. So you're done melting the whitestone, but you still have a whole bunch of this acidic compound kicking it in a warehouse somewhere? She's trying-- Percy? Percy, she's trying to bait you. She's trying to waste time right now. Come on. She's trying to-- Percy, la la la. Percy, come on. Come on, he's not there. Percy? No! Percy! We're running out of time. I'm having deja vu. Here we go. Jenga. Fucking asshole. (laughter) It's a trap. It's such a trap. Come on, Sneak Attack. Oh! Percy's pissed. He Percy'd. 13. Oh wait, sorry. Might have jumped the gun a bit there. I'm excited. Sorry. I'm bringing up the ranks anyway, I think. It's fine. Oh yeah, she's all about this fucking shit. Maybe hold her neck. Make sure it goes down. What's up, Grog? No, but we'll keep it. Professor Anders. Professor Anders. You're sucking his energy? Spoke too soon. Spoke too soon. You mock fate, fate punches you in the mouth. I'm running like hell. Running, running, running. Can I see? Can I peek around the corner just to see? Can I see Cassandra? Healing Word. Healing Word. Family resemblance. I'll cast it-- no, I'm just going to keep it at 1st level for now. I'm going to save my higher-level ones for Cure Wounds, so I'm going to cast it at 1st level, so that's 1d4 plus my spellcaster. Three. That's not too bad. No, sorry. 16? No, 13. Does it seem more extreme than it has been in the past? Oh, when it counts. SAM and Oh, you better not! I knew it. I knew he was going to do that. Okay, can I see Vax down? Which one is he on the ground? Okay. So I'm going to move around, tuck in the door a bit. Can I tuck right here? God, I'm shaking. Yeah, right behind that door. Okay, I'm going to duck down, crouch on the floor. I'm going to cast-- first I'm going to-- god I'm so nervous-- I'm going to use Healing Word on Vax, and heal that motherfucker. You're like down down, right? But he just hit zero hit points, so whatever I bring will bring him over, correct? Okay, I'm just going to do a-- I'm sorry, a level one Healing Word for right now. Yes, which gives you 12 hit points. And then I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Grasping Vine, and I'm going to take the vine and I'm going to wrap it around-- Huh? Next to me. I guess, yes. I want to wrap it around Cassandra's feet, her ankle, and I want to pull her toward me. And I say, "Hi! Just hang on." And that's my turn. She smoke-bombed out. There is Percy! Yes, you can. Believe! Just the tip. Like, "Come at me, bro?" That's awesome. So there are two guys alive right now? One's on Scanlan. How's Cassandra looking next to me? Looks fine. Okay, I've got my Grasping Vine still up. I'm going to wrap it around the guy that's close to Scanlan and just yank him off of Scanlan. Okay, and then I will just go, oh! And pop him with my staff. Yeah, I got a big old staff, yo! I'm not great at it, but I can do it. Oh, that's not bad. 16. Aw. (ping) It sounded nice, though. Kind of resonated a little. Yep. Come on, Trinket. Kill them.
