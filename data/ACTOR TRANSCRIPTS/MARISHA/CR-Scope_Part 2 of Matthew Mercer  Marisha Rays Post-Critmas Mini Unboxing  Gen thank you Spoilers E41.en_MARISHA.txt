There you go! People are joining. Give it a little bit of time. (laughs) Periscope destroys your battery. Sorry, guys, Matt's phone died, people who are just joining. No, that's not Kelly Clarkson, that's P!nk! Come on, now! Come on. That's what she said? Free him from his shackles! Someone said we should make this one a space dragon and put all the NASA stickers on him. This how every dad feels on Christmas morning. Dear god, this has turned into an epic trilogy. You know this is going to be a thing. Is getting it out of the box half of the challenge? Does that add to his challenge rating? Azerith says it took him a good 20 minutes to open his when he first got it! That's good to know. Thanks for the heads up, Azerith. Maybe if you get the tape off the back? There's tape up the back. How do you want to do this, babe? It's kind of hilarious from this perspective because it's just cardboard. It looks like you're battling cardboard. You look like so many people I've seen on Hollywood Boulevard, man, just battling cardboard. Go, you got this! Keyleth is level 13. What'd you get? No! (silly voice) "Hey guys! Hi! I'm Thordak! It's mighty nice to be free from that cardboard prison!" What. Yeah, he scares easy, which is funny. He might be the biggest scaredy-cat out of everybody in real life. In real life, I think he jumps more at scary movies. He's afraid of heights. He freaks out about dangerous things a lot. It's my favorite. In-game, he gives zero fucks. It's my favorite. Look at that big old bastard. How'd that go again? Was that the mock battle? That was the mock battle? That was the run-through. I was going say, he didn't use his breath weapon. That satisfying? Call that the Scanlan special. Gandalf! You looked more like Gandalf. You're too cute to have a breath weapon. You're like mep! (silly voice) "Hey guys, look at my little breath weapon! It's so cute!" Do one more. Yeah, look at his six pack. All right.
