That one might have made me cry a little bit. Yeah, just a little. We're the beginning of the announcements. It's great. We were talking about the playlists. Yeah! You're almost done. I will say, for those who have not gone and checked out any of the playlists, we have Vax and Percy up as well. Definitely go do it, because all that little extra content that we put out is always kind of a litmus test, to see if people are going to be interested in it. And if you guys go and actually visit the webpage at Geek & Sundry, then we get more content. So the more you go visit it-- Yeah, the more that we can show the people upstairs that people do like our stuff and our content, the more you will get. So please go check it out if you have not yet. It helps. You're welcome. Yes, I'll be there. We'll be there. Probably watching his panels. Which leads us to our next point. Please don't send us bodies. Pretty sexy. Channing Tatum. Channing Tatum is Geralt of Rivia. Count Duke. Go get them stats, boy! TALIESIN AND Vecmeyer? Vedmeyer is a goliath? Does Polymorph carry over? You have 115 hit points. You are like a drunk guy at a craps table. He's taking them off the grid. TALIESIN AND Don't you have a torch? How did this plan happen, then? Why didn't you say I don't have fire?! I said, "Hey Scanlan, I should come with you," and you said, "I can take care of myself. How many times do I have to tell you guys? I don't need "your help." Dorito's a failure, you guys. See how cool it was! Do you have an adventurer's kit? Okay! It looks like a Frank Miller comic right now. It's what I see in my head. You have, and we're just getting started. Can it carry you? Just surf on the giant floating hand. Through the sky. Yeah. All you have to do is live. Trust fall? They're attacking the-- That's so cool. This Elder Scrolls music is pretty dope. Cool. Which dice? Green dice. That was-- nope. Not good. Five. Tylieri? Great weapon master? What? Son of a bitch. Okay, can I see the smoke from the fire rising up from what Scanlan did on the other house? That's not great. 12? Okay. Shit. Are there any other windows along the back side of the house? Through the side. No other windows? Shit. Okay, I'll go inside. Is there anything in this direction? This way? Can we not get this way? Do we know if there are any outside doors over here on this side? Could I have gone around the edge here to see? Would we have known, going on this side, if there were any doors? And we still have no way into this main room, either, yet? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm an asshole. (giggling) I turn into an asshole. Were there any-- fuck, I really don't want to have to blow-- okay, so I'm going to--- Yeah, you know what? I didn't go inside. I'm outside. Dick. All right. Okay. Fine, I'll just see if this fucking door is open. That's all I can do right now. Yeah. Sorry, guys, excuse me. Sorry, excuse me. Okay, can I cross over to that window and look out the front window? The window over here? Do I see any fire from Scanlan? That's my turn. Oh, yeah. Can I call him? Can I, (whispering) "Scanlan. Scanlan!" Son of a bitch. All right. Shoot out the window. That's better! That's not bad, though. Yes! Dukes of Hazzard! As he slides over the table in front of me, I go, "That was pretty awesome. Bye. Good luck." Trinket! I'm coming! Okay! So seeing Vax go over the table and being like, "That was cool," I'm also going to be like (grunts) over the table. I'm going to join the Dukes of Hazzard train. Damn it. That's not bad! Acrobatics? 17? So I'm going to come in and I see a headless dude with mist swirling around him? Someone could yell at me to do it. Okay. This one. Yes, it is. Just with my modifier? Wait, is this a saving throw? Just my modifier, so 17. Well, I know what I want to do, but I can't do it without feeling guilty! I was going to Sunbeam this bitch. What makes sense? That I wouldn't know? I would just see a black mist? Well, if I saw a black mist, what I would probably do, realistically, is think it was some sort of poison shit and I would Wind Wall it. So I'm going to (goosh) Wind Wall that mist. (weakly) It's what I would assume it was, but I might be aiding it in getting away. This is bullshit. I Wind Wall it to keep, essentially do the Wind Wall-- Yeah, around Grog. Yeah, I'd want to protect him from the crossbows. And then I once again go, "Scanlan! Scanlan!" Yeah, I'm going to back into the corner and keep this Wind Wall up. So am I encapsulating the mist in my Wind Wall? I'm kind of trapping the mist in? A half-circle, yeah, but is it stuck in the wall? Okay. That it does. That's my motherfucking Wind Wall! It's coming in handy. Sorry. It's a wall of wind. How much? It could be worse. That's six plus four, so ten. You can get through the Wind Wall. Well, I mean, it's going to save a bear, right? After I punched him with the wind. 15 foot high. Okay. So I'm going to keep maintaining this Wind Wall and wrap it up around the mist to double-enforce it, and I'm going to scream, "What is this?" Does that count? I'm not metagaming! I'm legitimately asking whether this counts! (weakly) Oh! Great! I'll drop the Wind Wall and cast Sunbeam and, eyes flashing, light just (goom), right in the concentrated beam where I have this mist there. And stuff. That's my turn. Why do I have to ask for forgiveness?! I can use my bonus action to heal somebody, if someone wants it. Actually, how about this? I used my bonus action to ask what the shit was this. Does that make you feel better? Bless you. Oh god, you killed Grog! How many's left? They were trying to haul ass out? They're going to try and flee, aren't they? Eat it. Make them all eat it. Do I kill him or do we keep him? Is he coming back inside? Is that a window I'm up against, behind me? I'm just going to go, "Excuse me. Excuse me, Trinket. Sorry." And I'm going to peek around the door and go (shkoof) and Sunbeam him. That guy. That scared-shitless guy. It's what I just did. Six. It's a concentration spell. It's a concentration spell. I can keep doing it for a minute. Yeah, it's pretty dope. 16. That's 23 plus... 30 damage. Radiant damage. (lightning noise) Since I'm outside on the threshold of the house, can I see where Scanlan might have lit up the other house yet? 17? Okay. I stay standing outside just staring out into the distance, waiting for Scanlan's cue. Yeah, I know. Which is what we were technically supposed to do. One leg? 27. Fuck.
