Oh, is the visual still on Matt? Aww, damn it! Yes! You got a Trinket? Oh my god! Shut. Up. That's so cool! Yes! It's going to be, "The Magic Carpet of A Different Color". Also, I had one of the first run of these Critical Role shirts returned to me. I'm not sure who, someone from Canada. So if you could e-mail me and give me your right address. I'm not sure who it was. But I had one returned. Kit's awesome. Yes. 826LA is an after-school tutoring program and they feature in creative writing, and storytelling, and they have a Young Authors' program, which is super amazing. And they also tend to have really cool storefronts. There's one here, locally, in Los Angeles, one in Echo Park, and one in Mar Vista. But there tend to be 826s in major cities all across the country. So you should check it out, and go to their storefronts and tutor the kids and get involved. They're a really good program. We all got things. Ooh! Seekwet pwesent! Woo! He's stuck on the 5. Underdark. (Michael Jackson voice) That's ignorant. (laughter) That's cool! Yeah, put him to sleep. Oh, he's got to have a-- I've got access to this thing. Let me show you. Yeah, some Jethro Tull up in here. Are we there yet? Is he still grappled? Come on! Yeah, if we can keep him controlled. I can get him mind-controlled on our team for 30 days. He's going to be like that one scene in Lord of the Rings. You speak Giant?! He's so cuddly! I don't want to see the giant fist of Scanlan. Capture! Oh, do we have more? I've got one right here. Throw it to that table. Whose turn is next? Can I go next? And help him out? Are we still trying to capture him? Okay, I'm going to-- Can I move, can I get to him? If I turn into a snake, can I get down there? Big snake? (laughter) I want to turn into a giant constrictor. Real big snake! Yeah, I'm going to constrict him. I'm a naga! I'm so pretty. And I'm going to start constricting. I get a plus six. Oh wait. It's a strength-- -- bonus, I guess. So 14. I thought we were trying to capture him. Go to sleep! Or can we figure out a way to restrain him? Because here's the thing, I have an ability where I can use Geas. And cast Geas on him, and I basically give him a command and he'll essentially become our big-- He'll be our big, beefy minion for 30 days. And if he resists it, he takes psychic damage. No. You had a snack not that long ago. Can I take time, if we grapple him and I take a rest, essentially, almost take a 20 to cast Geas on him? Generally takes a minute to cast. Can I do that? I guess you can help me out? I'm going for it. He has to succeed on a wisdom saving throw against me. Oh yeah. What, it's wisdom. Oh, against my spell save? 18. It's like a political rally? Follow our orders. Help us fight K'Varn. Vex, how do you say, "Follow our orders," in Underdark? (gibberish) How do I say 'kill'? I look at him and I go (retching noise) K'Varn! Shut up, Percy. I'm not from here, clearly. (retching noise) K'Varn. Follow our orders. You roll with us. You our posse now. I don't think he can understand you. There's a translation barrier going on. I already told him that. He's in our posse. Well, you, here, for now. You. We roll together. I'm trying to say we roll deep. I take that as a good nod. It keeps up for 30 days. What should we call him? Tiny! He's a Fomorian? What are we checking? Ooh! The Fromorians. Well, the Fromorians-- For-morians. Foh-morians. Foh-MOH-ree-ans. An 18 plus ten, so 28. Fomo. Yeah. Well, I mean, it sort of has to. It starts to fry his brain if he doesn't. We might be able to box him up, or maybe we should chain him up while we sleep or something. I don't know. I mean, he should be okay. Well, hang on. What are we doing from here? Because it's going to dictate what I pick. But we can send the giant beating on the front temple door. No, it was already open, remember? No, it's open. Some sort of glass. Yeah. Okay, here's my thing. Why do we need to do reconnaissance? We already know what we need to do. Well, I mean, I could do some Heat Metal and weaken it. The Elder Brain casing was, not necessarily the cross. Don't Google it. I can possibly-- I'll make sure I learn Heat Metal and I can heat the edges of the crossbeam. And then if we can have Grog bring something heavy after we've weakened it. Hot metal bends. Can you levitate or do something to move a giant boulder that we can drop on top of it? Well, according to Clarota, it was pretty heavily-- You mentioned that the Elder Brain was pretty protected from physical damage. That there was lots of magical enchantments and stuff? Oh, you mean-- What if, instead of letting it fall before we fully break it, we take the rope and rope it. And chain, and then lift it and then take it away. TALIESIN AND It looks like a beehive. Go have a look, why? You're just going to get caught. I'm just wondering what more you're going to find out from a flyby that I couldn't find out from my vision. Oh no! Oh God. Can I do something? I go ahead and cast Enhance Ability for dexterity on Scanlan over here. New carpet! It's advantage. You get to roll twice. I like it. It probably would be a contest of wills. Well, what if we-- How about this, why don't we turn him into a mouse and we can just keep him as our, you know, emergency pocket mouse, and whenever, if we need a quick distraction, then we flick him in his mouse nuts and drop him over and-- After we've destroyed the mechanism, yeah. That's why I was saying if we can-- I think if we tie a chain to it, I think we break the beams and then air-evac it out, personally. Well then, how about this? Why don't we concentrate, instead of-- Because okay, it's a middle cross beam thing, right? Why don't, instead of focusing on the middle section, we focus just on two sides, so it goes. I can talk to the bats or I can Dominate a bat. I could talk to the bats. I'll make sure I can talk to the bats. No. I mean, I could Fog Cloud us. We could look like a big, floating cloud. Well, here's the thing are we trying to actually-- We're not trying to get inside the temple. Could you fashion-- Well, I'm flying people overtop, I'm assuming. I think we should all be on top together. I don't think we should try and separate. A sparrow. Aw. I'm trying to figure out a way we could just conserve the acid, like if I could-- Okay, yeah. Okay, try it gingerly. Are we going to fight him now or are we going to try and run? Are we going to try and lure our way-- We could still take a similar approach and just have-- We've already decided we're going to have two teams to be on two separate ends to do the slidey-- The hingey maneuver. And then have a third team that's K'Varn distraction duty. Right, so if-- So we've got this pyramid. And there's this cross beam, you said, right Matt? And there's this top of it, which is open. So this is the pyramid. You can see. And then the thing is, if you can see through it, the thing is hanging down. And it looks, it's all spirally. And then here is-- The Elder Brain. Somewhere in here! So if we go for-- Drop in if we have to and, yeah. So, okay okay, hang on. What happens if this starts going poorly? Or if you're dead? Should we have a safe location? Grog, what are you thinking over there? It worked for the Spartans in that awesome 300 comic. Shut up. It was awesome in the comic. It's got a massive cross beam supporting a giant arch structure. Yeah! I mean, Grog. If it gets to a point where we want to go in, I will go in underneath with you. I'll do my earth elemental thing. I'll go with you if it gets to that point. Well, right now, you are going to be mouse. And then-- Wait for me to finish my thought. Stay with me. And then, you fight K'Varn. You kill beholder. Eat food. Yes, delicacy. I'll be on the carpet. No, we're all magic carpeting. Can we-- Here's the thing. If I turn into a hawk, I won't be able to turn into an earth elemental. The stealthiest. Stealth people first. Someone's burning a spell, or we're going in shifts. One of the two. So we're picking one, rather. Polymorphing Trinket-- Or we're casting Fly on him. What if we cast Fly on the bear? Can you cast Fly on Trinket and then have Grog ride Trinket? Is that the same problem? So we can all Fly? Who else can go, is there room for one more? No. I stay behind. Yeah, people were dropping people off. Awesome. Can I go ahead and cast Pass Without a Trace on the rest of us? It's so cute. 34. I turn, and I, seeing the bats come in, in bat language, in like, you know, echo (bat noises). Echolocation. I tell the bats, don't worry about it. Go home. We're running an errand for K'Varn. Don't worry about it. Oh, but I had a good roll. But I had a good roll. I cast Speak with Animals. That's what I cast. It was a spell. No, I said I do this. I cast Speak with Animals. 18. It's really distracting. I hope so. Does he get double Pass without a Trace? Well, do you want to work on one beam and I can maybe do a focused soldering on the other? Okay, okay. I'll take one side. And Grog's going to take the other beam. I'm going to start-- I'm going to take my staff and I do a concentrated Heat Metal spell, and I'm just going to kind of solder right along the inside where it's already weakened. Right. Well then, why don't I'll heat the metal while Grog is prying it to help? He's using like a crowbar. Right? Well we'll tag team it, then. Yeah, but we want to save him. Let's see if we can do this, first. Well, we can have Tiberius hit him with, like, a quick damaging spell and make him-- Well, why don't we weaken the beams first? What do you mean? Well it's good-- jig's going to be up as soon as a giant-- But what if it doesn't bust all the way through until we start popping some of the beams? It's a three-inch-thick piece of pane and steel. Should I go ahead and heat the metal, just in case, for added stuff? I mean, that's quiet. Why would you say that? We weakened only one side, so hopefully it'll only smash one side. Maybe we can even try and aim him leaning towards our side more. I start heating the metal beams, concentrating from both sides. I am gonna go ahead and cast Stoneskin on myself. I cast Stoneskin on myself Oh, is he dead? Maybe we should just go? What'd he say? I left the door open for you? Are we leaving? Nine. Come on, Pike. Oh, it's me. This may-- Okay. How big of a jump is it from me to K'Varn? (laughs) I'm gonna do it. Fuck it. YOLO! I'm going to run off the carpet and I'm going to do a swan dive and-- I'm on the edge of the platform-- Running, and I'm going to swan dive, and as I swan dive-- Okay. 15. And as I get closer, mid-swan dive, I'm gonna turn into my earth elemental, and grab him, and take him down with me. With the earth elemental's strength? Oh, I don't have this book, it's in the Monster Manual. We didn't print this out yet. I rolled a 19. And right before I swan dive, I go-- I yelled-- Or, before I transformed, I yell to the party, go! Get away! Let me be heroic! I've got-- Holding onto his eye stalks and I'm riding him. I've got him! No, you can-- Don't feel like you shouldn't hit things because of me. I've got 126 hit points as an earth elemental and they don't affect my hit points. Once I hit zero, I go back to whatever hit points I had. I can act like a tank. Which is what I'm doing. Go for it! I'm also immune to a lot of shit. I would appreciate that. Also, Pike too, right? Didn't she have an advantage thing? No, Grog! Oh, stop being so pouty, you knew this was coming. You're-- Yeah, totally. I don't know what I did, but you're welcome. What was this one? Sorry, I was shell-shocked. Okay. 15. Damn it. Wait, do I have advantage for that? Still? Do I still have advantage for that? Okay. Do you crit on 18? Grog, fastball special? Want me to toss your ass up there? See if you can grapple on to him? I can try, yeah. All right, I'm going to cheerleader-toss Grog. So I want to take Grog and push him up to see if he can essentially do what I did to K'Varn. I would have to hold my turn. 'Cause I can't reach him, right? I probably can't jump to reach him either. I'll hold my turn, then. I'll hold my turn. 'Til Grog's Is that temporary hit points? Okay. Yeah. Oh, I'm getting a donut. Hang on. Okay. TALIESIN AND Fastball Special. So, "Gymnast, hyup!" Adds strength. Check. 15. But I'm also a giant earth elemental. Pretty freaking huge. Horn. Horn. Horn! Like a bolo? Hold on! It's going to fly up? Can I move underneath so I can maybe catch Grog from where I cheerleader-- Prep. Prep for the basket? Because I imagine it was like a cheerleader. Can someone handle the fucking meatball? Come on, Percy. (grunting affirmatively) My turn? Is it my turn? Sure. I'll go ahead-- Since she's a tiny dwarf, I'll-- What's that, just a strength check as an elemental, I guess? 23. It's like Ren Faire. Anything that has a name, like Chain of Something. Chain of Dope. Oh, I hope it was a Disintegration ray one. Vox Machina! The horn was from Orcus. He's not a demigod. Yes. What is the situation? I'm sorry. What was that? What was that? What was that situation with the-- The hanging, you know, Metropolitan Museum of Art piece? Can I as a rock monster go up to it and grab it? It's very heavy? I was going to try and bring it down on top of K'Varn. I'm then just going to run and just do a double strike. Well, you know what? I'm going to run in and just grapple him. I'm going to grapple him again. Nine. Oh. I do, Mr. Pack Away Your Dice. Why not-- I can just rip it off. I'm a rock dude. Yes, we do. Oh, please. Pooper face. You were so poopy the entire end of that game. Why? What are you-- What are we in for? I'm with Vex. Yeah, your head shots fucking MVP, man. Well, we've got to get the hell out of here, now. Would you stop that? You're kind of pinky, yeah. Over. I'm sweating. We didn't TPK. That was great. Those song parodies. Wait, say that again? Well, Zac was talking over you. We'll probably be there. Wait. Is she serious? Aww. Best response ever. Misplaced connections. 826 Chicago. That's so cool. Yeah. The DM says we're doing it well.
