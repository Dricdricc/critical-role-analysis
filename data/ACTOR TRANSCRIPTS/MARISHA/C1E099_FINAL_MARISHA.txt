Oh my god, right now. And we'll be like, "We used to hang out with him before he was famous." Did you really? I just remembered it was your birthday. I do still have some spells left. It depends on what you want to do, though, and what I have prepared. I can. I have a few options for that. I can do a Hallucinatory Terrain, which I could do right now because I do have it learned. It covers a 150-foot cube, which I don't know-- How wide is the hole? Well, we can if we gather them in one place. Are they attracted to anything like shiny things or movement? So they're attracted to movement and sound. Percy, you have a very loud banging thing. If we can get them all clumped together, I can throw down a few Fireballs and Flaming Spheres and probably take a lot of them out. But I need them clumped together. Are they still on the walls? Not all of them, but I can get a lot of them. Yeah, we can Fireball together. I point to a spot for Percy to see if I can get them to gather there, and I start readying a Fireball to launch. Okay, let me know when it looks like a good cluster. Yeah, let's just throw down a big ol' Fireball. 20-foot radius. Hey... Vax, do you still have any of that-- A hundred episodes, yeah. Five years, a hundred episodes later. Do you still have any of that poison? That poison-- anybody have any poison? You have poison? Well, I was thinking-- That's pretty good, Grog. Well, no. Ah, another time. I'll raincheck you, bud. Do we still have any more orc or boar parts? Yeah, like actual Raid. Like Raid. Like if we dip, maybe, some food in poison and throw it down there, everyone that's left will come and eventually eat it and die. I could-- I do still have my sixth-level spell, I could attempt to get to a few of their tunnels and collapse their tunnels. I could-- Hm, no, not really. I can create water, but I don't think it would be enough to flush them out. I mean, you volunteered it very quickly. Is that remnants of Dork, still? If I do like, a Commune with Nature, and then, because I know they're already-- Commune with Nature, and I-- I thought that was Conjure Fae. Can I, because I already got a map of their tunnels. Can I then do Move Earth to, like, try and collapse? You're going to Fire Storm them? Plus, technically isn't the point of a mine to, like, dig out holes? Do you think he has friends? He's always alone. And you should know that if you've apparently been watching us? Do I recognize this spell? Okay. You're totally right, he has so many friends. Wow, that was weird, you guys. It was weird. It is now your house. You're a homeowner. You get to pay property taxes! I get the big cushion! Display furniture sucks. I do, yeah. Yes, why? Fine. It can make alcohol and poison, but it can't make an English breakfast? Bullshit. Yeah, breakfast ale. That works. She seems nice. Hi! Cash it in! I feel like we could find better stew. No offense. So proud. I understand legacy and responsibility and I think it's very admirable of you to recognize your place. A year ago, it was definitely true, but now... Yeah, you're definitely the face guy! You're the good salesman! You can sell anyone on a shitty cake that you baked! I can come get you. I mean, to be fair, Tary does have a point. I also have a responsibility, and... I'm the chief of my people. Oh, no, this is probably a Tree Stride situation. Let's do that. Whatever, that one. Sorry, that's the fifth level one. The sixth level teleport... transport... It is. Tree Stride just rolls off the tongue easier. Tree Uber. On the way out, I give the Sun Tree our secret handshake. It's so slow. What's happening though, really? It's a farmer's market! Hi! I need some fresh halibut right now! Is there flowers? Is there a flower shop? Like the festival. Yeah. Just go with it. Chode. What?! Are we all paying attention at this point? So, wait, he does know jokes, or he does know the Meat Man? But you don't know jokes? Do you know Parchment, Boulder, Shears? Never mind. What?! Is he pulling a Dread Pirate Roberts? Does he wear a beret? Marquet? Ank'harel? Bigger than Marquet. Ank'harel? (gasps) We're getting closer! Oh my god! We'll take the Tongues potion. How much? Come on, give it to me. What?! I don't have that much! Is it under a thousand gold? Then goodbye! We're getting out of his store front. Can we call you Lion for short? That's fierce! I'm Keyleth. Keyleth. Nice to meet you. Hang on a second. Will you earmuffs? He knows what earmuffs are! That's good. Anyway, why would Scanlan send a messenger? He has the gate stone! And why him? Scanlan's smarter than that, right? Chode? Look, a lot of people could go by the alter-ego Meat Man. Good point. Look, he's still doing it! He does follow directions well. Lionel. Not good. Oh no. Selling the secret recipe, man. Oh no. Wait, he said Marquet, though. I guess it depends on what he thinks it's worth to us. What makes you think that we want this information so much? What? What? What'd he say? Allura. What is happening? That's not bad, right? We had a friend who we thought it might've been him. Sorry. I'm sorry, you think that the title of Meat Man is so important that you had to kill or attack a gnome who also went by Meat Man? So, you've taken on the title yourself. And what city is he in chains beneath? He's totally Dread Pirates Roberts-ing this shit. Here's a question Why did Allura come to you for information? Right. So you have ears in all the right places. What if we gave you money and food and mutton? How much money does he give you? You could recruit him! The problem is that once he has the designs, he can replicate them. We've met a lot of doom-seers. You sure you can stand up to them? Can I do an insight check to see if I can glean any more of what he knows about this world-ending thing? Natural 20. Is he still walking away? I look at Vex and Vax and them and I say, we know him. There's something familiar about him. He knows more than he's letting on. Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Natural 20! Come on, Vex! No! I bust through right behind Vax. You dick! I knew you were familiar! No one talks about Scanlan being handsome as much as Scanlan does. That was your first giveaway, mister! Yeah, you're so good at that. Why did you want the designs? Are you a mafia don, Scanlan? Are you a bad guy? I pull Chod, Chard, Chode... Lionel. I pull Lionel aside. And I grab him by the face, and I say, we need you to be coherent and honest during this. And I cast Enhance Ability and give him Owl's Wisdom. It increases your wisdom. You get advantage on wisdom. Is it, though, Scanlan? Scanlan, there are some hurt feelings in this room, and it might be time to address those. I'm chief of my people! I did! I wish you were there! I mentioned you and everything in my speech. Yeah! Yeah! Does she like you now? And what kind of operation do you operate? And to whom do you sell these things? You're doing great. What were they throwing in? He stole it from you. No, you gave it to him! So you're just here to be an errand boy. That's all you want. To help us out. You traveled to a separate hemisphere to be a messenger. Did you not feel like you had a purpose when you were with Vox Machina? I'm not judging you in the moment. You know, there is a point that we are all family, but we are also all friends, and there is that old saying, be careful of the friends that drag you down. Maybe we were dragging you down. You know, you've broken a lot of hearts, Scanlan. I think you're still a heartbreaker. And I leave with them. Can we go to sleep now? Everyone's emotionally tired. What? The orb in Ank'harel? Are we all talking over our headpieces? I think that's what we're doing. He's a dick, he can hear us. I know the range of these things. Are we supposed to be angry, or sad, or happy? I don't know what all these feelings are all at once. Can I? Yeah, he needs a stiff drink. And security blankets. It stops here. It stops at the camera line. Grog, don't kill him! Grog, don't kill him! Keyleth is just watching intently, and more importantly watching Grog, making sure he doesn't actually beat him to death. We'll stop this if it gets bad. Off a Duck's Back?! It's going down in the Whole Foods parking lot! Oh, because he has a second... What would Chode do? I've never seen Grog walk away from a fight. He's not fine. What are you talking about? That was good chocolate milk! Chocolate's expensive, here. Just drink it first. The idiot has a point. Oh hey, Tary. You're still here. I know. You're not wrong. I did. What do we do? Hey, Chode? Sorry. Chard? Where did you come from before you met Scanlan? Just let him tell his story. Yeah, how'd you know they were ducks? Normally ducks don't live in the desert. They were ducks. The ducks blessed you. And your birth and your survival. He doesn't know what a vulture is! (chuckles) That's a continent, but-- oh wait, no, the continent-- no, Marquet is the continent. Ank'harel is the city, okay. That's fair. I've earned that. Family. He talked a lot of family to you? And ducks. Did he talk much more about his family to you? We like you. We like you, Chode. Lionel. We like you, Lionel. Hey, Lion. C'mere, c'mere. Parchment-boulder-shears. Parchment-boulder-shears! I'm going to teach you. Okay, ready, ready, ready? Boulder, parchment, or shears. Okay. Ready? On three. JON and Right as Vax walks in-- Fuck! Hey, guys! We're playing Boulder-Parchment-Shears! And then I Alter Self my fist into a rock elemental fist, a Keyteor fist, and I go, see, look! Boulder! And I backhand Lionel. Just with my fist? Sure, you want me to use Earth elemental? I mean, yeah, yeah, totes. 18. Just to one? Plus five. So, six, six damage. This is the best game of Boulder-Parchment-Shears! Hey, guys, does anyone have any shears? Shears? I go, hey guys, hey guys! Shears! And I grab onto his plate armor and I cast Heat Metal. (sizzle) 2d8 damage. Oh, I do. Elemental damage. Ooh, yeah. Ten damage. Keyleth throws her arm around Vax and catches him up the whole way we walk. I really think you would really like Chode. He's super nice, and he likes drinking chocolate milk... We got to talk a lot. We talked about his background... Yeah, gosh. Where were you? Yeah. The ziggurat's kind of a big deal, right? I feel like that's warranted for extra Ashari leave time, for diplomatic duty. Right? I did say duty. I'll let Dad know he's going to have to watch the tribe for a few more weeks. But one of these days I will have to be getting back. Very soon. Oh, this is like a one-channel frequency. We can all hear you. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Something like this is better done in person, as opposed to over a communication device. Nope, you should not. What do the ducks say? The same reason why pigeons are in Costco, okay? Hi, Scanlan. Again! Yeah, you can go to Ank'harel, but we'll be right behind you, I guess. We know who you are now, Aes... Agus... To Ank'harel in the morning, then. Because I'm trying to sleep, you motherfuckers. The clasp is rusted from when we were in the water plane, I can't take it off. It's stuck there. We'll see him there. You could come with us. I said if you run away we'll still find you. Yay Chode! Lionel! Like, if people didn't think we had a writer's room before, they definitely are now! This feels like a marketing campaign!
