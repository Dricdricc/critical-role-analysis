You have that new Emmy smell. That's 100% true. She put it on her resume when she applied here, and I was super appreciative of it. Yeah. Episode one callback! My goodness gracious. I'm going to be there on Saturday! We have the Sagas of Sundry panel, in room 300B, at 200pm I think? Somewhere around there. Then after that we have the Women in Pop Culture panel. Everything is happening in 300B. Nein! Are we making our way back? Okay, let's go back. Is that a thing? The greed of the Crown, man. I love the rain. Let's go to sleep. Okay, that's a good idea. I hate ticking, or repetitive noises. That's so obnoxious. That. Exactly like that. That counts as well. Yeah. The same umbrella category, yeah. We just woke up, we're real tired, okay? Jesus. You're super spooky at night, you know that? You're a little pale, so you have this ghostly quality to you. I don't know why I'm whispering. We're all awake now. You all right? Maybe she was a ghost the whole time! That's heavy metal. That's a possibility. She probably just took off to handle some Yasha business, right, though? We'll ask Molly. We go downstairs. That's better! We were talking about a couple people watching out front, right? Someone from your deepest imagination. Green's pretty. Maybe you have a cleft chin. Yeah. And very curly! Yeah, she did that thing again. Does she sleep? She's a little creepy. In like, a hot way, but a little creepy. Yeah, kind of. It's very mysterious. I mean, we all have personal issues. Who? You? Us? Yeah. It did seem very pointed and targeted. See, I'm having a hard time myself getting through to Caleb, so I feel like it's hard for an asshole to teach an asshole. I should punch him in the face? I was having a side conversation! You can learn a lot of things from being punched in the face. Maybe we can also take the day to ask around and get a little bit more of a bead on the opinions of the locals on the current political climate. You're very smart, Jester. Are you going? You're going to the fancy place. He's going with Jester. Yeah, I'll go with you guys. Along the way, can I look for a tailor? Fucking balls. Seven. Someone who can sew me a custom coat, a cloak, or add a lining to something like that. Do they do custom there? That's fine. Done. I would like to take one of their cloaks and have a blue liner put on the inside to make it reversible. Like one of those baggier, poncho coats. One of those? Thank you, sir! So many things. I had one of those last campaign. That was a ring of holding, yeah. Good stuff. I'm all nice and buttoned up. Belt tied. Looking tough. It's a good name. Zombra Spire-- Zombra? Okay, it's Bel-Air. Okay! It was so good, too! Almost! Did you see that? History? Six. Yeah, it's, like, the Zauber Spire, the Constellation Bridge, and whatever the Triumph Tower is. Chime. I think it's a church. Or a cult. Or a church-turned-cult. I don't remember. It is. Like a tiki bar! Maybe we can go shopping and come back? I'm following, by the way. Oh my god. Edubation. It's because this whole place is magical, Caleb. Does there appear to be a used book section, like trade-ins? Huh. Okay. You can learn a lot from what people wrote in books. Hey, Jester. Do you think that the fact that this place is called, "Chastity's Nook" gives everyone a complex who shops here? Yeah. (whispers) Aw, you beat me to it. I would love to see it right now. Do you have a sample? What is it? She's very heavy-handed with her innuendos. They keep talking about the heft of his equipment. A lot of reference to his equipment. Yeah, it's-- Do you--? Oh, do I. Fuck! I was thinking of Fjord as I was trying to be nice! It's cocked, right? Okay, thank you. 18. You know, there seems to be a lot of machinery knowledge and, like, heavy machinery knowledge. Was that also an interest of yours? Man, I've never seen engineering and-- combined! Consider me interested. Yeah, I almost asked if there was. Is there a mailing list? You got to get the word out. Get people interested. Sure! Oh, Caleb. Yeah, there are muffs? Like hand muffs? (skeptical noise) As we walk along to the Pillow Trove, when we walk by the flowery bushes, I slowly pop all the blossoms off the flowers as I go. She's really pretty. Yeah. Sure! Your hands are dirty! You're covered in bread! Oh, that's right! Would you like that? Would you like some mitts? You know this is how diseases are spread, right? Okay. Did we get a good view? Okay. Natural 19. Plus three so 22. At the top of the Zauber Spire? What do they look like? Are they wearing any colors? Just looking. Just, you know, people watching. These two assholes up there on the top of the Zauber Spire. LIAM, MARISHA, and Hey, the whole Cerberus Assembly thing. Do you know much about them? Yeah, no. I know. We're both empire kids, right? More so than the rest of the Nein? What do you think about the empire? About the crown? Okay. I think it's kind of bullshitty. I don't know, look at this. Look at how much money is up here compared to elsewhere. This is a lot of control. (laughs) (sighs) No. I just want to make a ton of money and drink a lot of booze. I think best we can do is try and be happy in, as you said, this shitty situation that we've all been granted. Yeah. Anyway, should we go? Mind if I take a look at it? I'm going to flip through it. Does anything catch my eye based on what I know? You know, this reminds me of the stuff that I used to read back in school. No, like all the history stuff. It feels like a bored monk wrote this. A real bored monk. I might read it later when you're done reading it. Really? It's a great gift. Honestly, I was thinking about buying it and then you beat me to it. Great minds, right? What's this book called? Does it have a name? Courting of the Crick. I know. Yeah, I'm not going to be able to type that in. I'll write that down. You see why I left this town? Ugh, people. Good when you all are good. (singing) Okay. Before you leave, real quick, Beau asks you if you found any information out while you were on your journey. Really? I'm with it. Right. Interesting. We went to the fancy end of town where I'm pretty sure everyone is super into the crown because they are all funded by the crown and they are the crown, so I was like eh, probably a bad place to start asking political questions. We did, yeah! Went to a smut shop. As to be expected. Smutty. What should we do? Yeah, in case it's a trap or something. Also, we know that people are looking for these type of rebels. If we can see a board ratting people out, so can other people. We don't want to get caught in a sting operation, for lack of a better term. Yeah. Big money! Are you fucking serious? Wait, they're both threes. I rolled two threes. Both threes. Four, so seven. Can you try and pick this? Oh my god. I'm going to stand watch in the opening of the alley. I'm going to make sure while he does this. We could get Nott in here to try and pick it. Just leave it nicely looked like it's not opened. Yeah. I'll be right back. Nott! I hate to interrupt your dinner. Can we borrow you for a quick second? Can you pick this? Yeah. Yeah. He takes one end; I take the other. Jesus fucking ballsacks. Seven again. Oh that sucks. Oh I have thieves' tools! Can I try? I give Nott my thieves' tools. Yeah, I stole them off of a really rich guy. Yeah. You'll just owe me later, how about that? I put on the goggles. It's not the same cellar. There's no entrances? No secret entrances? No trap doors hiding behind barrels? Don't fuck this up this time, come on. It's cocked on a 20. What? Well. Okay. What am I doing? Investigation? 11. Any good bottles of wine or brews laying around? There's a skeleton down here? Did they not clean when they bought this place? Yeah. Hang on, no one's around, right? I'm going to pull out my adventurer's kit and light a torch, because fuck this darkvision shit. No one knows we're down here, right? The door's closed. Okay. Do we see anything else weird? More dead bodies, anything like that? That's really gross. Yeah, anything else now that I have the light on? I don't see anything? Shit. (long sigh) I take one of those bottles of beer, then I leave. Frumpkin? I don't know. Let's do that. You can Message Caleb. Or any of us. Okay. Any other prep we should do? Okay, let's do this. Get food. I'll read some of my book. Iva! Go kill-- That feels a little premature. I want to know who he is, though. Super interested to find out who this guy is. I feel like we should deal with one thing-- I'm super focused on this current-- Last thing we want is to take the fall for these assholes, whoever they are. Read the book! You go back and forth. Conflict between the Julous Dominion? Dwendalian Emp. That's good, 17. Theo, okay. SAM and Ruined forever. Okay, test of wits. Like, Dinner with Andre style? The assassin removed his helmet? Wait, am I writing down smut right now? TRAVIS, MATT, and Hang on. Are you going into how Theo and the assassin had a thing? Okay, keep going. I'm into it, though. This has to be important! He's telling it to me! Okay. He's a dark elf, right? Or a drow? That's cool. It's meant as an intimidation tactic. It's this high-pitched screaming cricket chirp that rushes in, so that's where the term "Crick" comes from. It is used in a derogatory fashion towards individuals who live within the empire of Xhorhas and Kryn. The book talks about them dueling wits, finding common ground, and getting angry at each other and murderous, then turns into this torrid love affair in this very Anthony/Cleopatra feel to it. It's very dry. It's an older book. It doesn't match some of the imaginatory flair of some of the other smut that you briefly perused as you were walking in the bookstore earlier. You glean a little bit of information, should this be accurate at all, of some of the relationships or dynamics of the empire and the Xhorhasian folk that live beyond the border. It's not like, "by the third lamppost, remove this brick." Okay, cool. This book sucks. Halfway, maybe. Couple hours. Yeah. Tton it is. Yeah. Let's do this. Okay. Table right. Is it just the four of them? No more? Okay. Yeah, we sit. It's polite. A valuable asset. Good with... things. Thrym. The human male? Especially considering you said the Richter was already pretty corrupted. Seems like assassination attempts in reverse wouldn't be out of her bailiwick. Here's my question to Dolan, why do you want-- Horris wants to be in the office? Dolan, what makes you think that you can beat the system that you would then be joining? Yeah, sorry about that. Well, you could do a lot with a seal from a lord. A lot more than claiming an assassination attempt. Just throwing it out there. Literally anything else. It's an okay name. You could workshop it. There's always more names. There was also the notice on the King's Hall looking for y'all. I don't know if you knew that, by the way. I imagine a notice in one of these people's houses might mean that they have concern of being found. You could win twice. Now, the Lawmaster works under the High-Richter, right? Yeah. Kara, I think it's Kara. I like that. Tell us about this Myriad, a little bit. What is it exactly that you guys are so nervous about with these people? What name should we be looking for? I'll give you one piece of advice, Dolan, though. I would challenge you to think about this for the night, think real long and hard, if you're willing to jump into the ring. Some pretty high-ranking asshole gladiators. Should probably be willing to take a few licks. Shut up. You know, make sure you know what you're getting into. Awful people. Powerful tricks. That's all. Crazy! TRAVIS and I agree. Who knows? We can't be replacing someone corrupt with someone even worse. Yeah, we don't know anything about this Dolan, this Horris' motives, or their agenda. Should we go now? We would have told you the two humans. Two humans. House rule. Yeah, just a clown. Actually, that was pretty cool. You learned something! I agree. Yeah, maybe we can even split a team, some people go and spy on the house, some people maybe go to the stockade, talk to the people she's locked up? I'm down for that. Well, is Ulog still sitting at the other table? At this hour? Interesting. I don't do anything for altruistic reasons. Well, if this plan gets pulled off, and we help Dolan get in that seat of the High-Richter, than we suddenly have friends in high places. And I love an owed favor. Yeah. Start there, why not? Is The Pillow Trove still open? We can try and ask there, huh? I know, that's what I was thinking. Sleeping. No more Oskar for you. Should I not? Yeah, see what you can find. Have I finished it? I haven't finished it. I'll give it to him, it's fine. He needs a little self confidence, a little encouragement? Lot of great shirts in the store. Great shirts. That's so great. Can we go to sleep, now? Did you find anything good in this? It doesn't really ultimately matter, but I feel like that was like a toxic relationship. I didn't really feel like the assassin and Theo should have-- I mean, he led to her death. That kind of sucks. Did you get a book? Circuit judge. I have this inventory sheet that I got from the Baumbauchs, we could use this as claims that it got stolen. And hope for reimbursement. This is like an order invoice that I have, right? No, the order ledger. No, but in that I have an order ledger? So we could claim that he never paid due and we are looking for some sort of representation to try and get our money from the Baumbauchs? Does it say on the ledger the company that it came from? Does it say like from Dryer Supply and Co.? Me! Me being an asshole. The Timalt Store House. So it can be from the Timalts. They never paid due on the order that we sent them. No, they're in Trostenwald. Timalt is from here, right? They are in Zadash. They made a shipment. Regardless, it's just a story so we can get a bead on her, right? That's not bad. What time is it? Is it early enough to where, on my way there, I can pick up my custom coat? Okay. Are we trying to go through the sewer? We can still find the back sewer entrance, have Nott pop the lock, and we know how to go. With my coat, kind of-ish? We're going to have to distract them. Yes! So into this! Is the sewer locked? That was awesome! Ooh, that guy is definitely arrested. We're all rolling stealth? 22. Can I take the brown side of my newly purchased reversible coat, take out my Brewer's Kit that I have, and take a few of the bottles and fashion them to my waist a little bit? Awesome. Okay, let's ask around and find where this Richter lives. Lawrence is great. Worked for me before. Actually, no. Let's do something else, considering I already used Lawrence once. Francis. Francis Titmalt-- Timalt, not Titmalt. Let's go. Super official. I think it was a fundraiser, last time you were up for election? Especially that Demedan. She directed us here, we thought, well, Dayana is just so sweet, she would of course help us out. Here is the invoice from the amount due that they have not paid from the Timalt Store House. Oh my god, what should I roll? Give me something good. That's not too bad. 15. And, of course, we would happily pay you for any type of additional services you might be able to help us out with. No, I don't think those were my words at all. No. And, of course, we are always willing to repay in favors. While he wraps it up, can I do a quick glance over her table or over her desk to see if I see any type of papers? Oh, I thought she pulled us inside. I'm sorry. Okay. That's what we were looking for this whole time. It's hard to find good help these days. Go, guys. Let's go. But we're assholes without power, though. I don't know, it's less dangerous? I don't know. It's that harvest fest. Remember, there's another tournament and stuff that we can enter into. I mean, look. People in power tend to get corrupt, they don't start corrupt. In my opinion, it doesn't matter who's sitting there, as long as we get paid from it, who cares? Yeah, I guess let's head there, meet up with these guys. It's probably about that time, yeah? Before we walk into the place, I turn my coat inside out, back to the blue. It doesn't look like anyone followed us in? Okay. Fjord and I will go over. Is that a problem? Hey friend. People like her make you uncomfortable? You sure? What about people like him? People like him make you uncomfortable? All right, just checking. He's fucking everywhere. He's been following us a lot. You said he was shifty, a little criminal-- Wait. 500 from his personal stash? (whispers) Just under 700. Breaking in. That is really nice. That's good. You could do this, some graphic design. If anything, I feel bad. Feels like they're investing a lot of money on this play. If he's High-Richter. Correct. It would be super unfortunate to see someone else slide in there, other than him. But like you said, not our problem. We have a little bit of time. We can still do a little bit of casing, maybe go talk to the Gentleman and see what he has to offer in between. Right? A day and a night? We got to go back to the Tri-Spire? Which we can do. Is that where Lord Sutan is? In the Tri-Spire? He respawned. Okay, well at dawn, we plan? At dawn, we plan. I think we're going to have to reignite our planning thread. It's time! Yeah. Dust the cobwebs off of it. It's good. We're going to go full Ocean's Nein, you guys! And bear claws.
