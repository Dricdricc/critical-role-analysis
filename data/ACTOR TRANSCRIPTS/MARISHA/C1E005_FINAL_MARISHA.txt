The first one tonight! Murgholt? Can I do an insight check to see if he's lying about that? 22. What about a secret path that we can maybe get through to avoid some of these people? Was kind of wondering if he's lying. Hey guys, we should press him for information about this passage. That's hot. Ooh, that's fun. Wait, wait, hang on. Why don't we take him with us? Just in casies-- Ew. It's starting to become a thing now. I'm just saying. Can I assist him? Can I do a nature check? Well, that's what I'm saying. 'Cause you're doing arcana? I'm doing nature. 29, nature. Demon narwhal. Yes. It's fine. Just let him go, it's all he's got. It's all he's got right now. He's naked, and now he's invisible running through a cavern. Oh look. And I just yell, sorry! This is a good lesson, to no one else that's watching. No one is watching this valuable lesson. To not be an oathbreaker. Is Grog about to get a new weapon? Do we need to give you a moment alone? We can leave. It was hidden by a lava flow. On the left side of the keep. That's true. He was gonna alert everybody. Eagle up? I cast Pass Without A Trace. Everyone stand near me. And I'll turn into an eagle and I scoop up the gnomes. Like a hundred yards. A 30-foot radius. Just, hug me. Stay close. 18. Wait, what are you doing? Less than 20. (eagle noises) Ouchies. I am no longer an eagle. Yeah. I hit zero hit points as an eagle. Help! I don't know what to do. Oh, come on, Tiberius. Oh, save my life, again, Tiberius. Oh shit. Wait, wait, we slam into the top of what? Can I cast Wind Wall right underneath of the carpet to kind of like airbend us up? Ahh! Ohh. Oh, Jesus. And did the Wind Wall thing work? Fucking shit. Not good. Seven. Three-point landing! What's Grog doing? And do what? He rolled a 19. Which is good. Fuck! Can we do nothing and-- Oh, no. What's going on with Grog? Ah, this is going terribly! I'm failing! Four. It's not gonna be good. You're out again? This the second time Grog's almost fallen to his death. 45? Oh. You know what, that could've been worse. We just crash-landed in a war camp. Oh boy. How, how-- Okay. Can we see people running towards us? We don't, I don't know. Mass Healing Word? Yeah, what's your Mass Healing Word? Yeah, we gotta go. Here, wait. Save the potion, I cast Healing Word on Percy. Oh, dope. Well wait, I can do what you're trying to do. I do Wall Of Stone. I'm like, oh, is this, oh-- Sorry! You should've just-- I would've-- they're not very-- Yeah. Right. Oh, yeah! Clarota! Wait! And now, Wall Of Stone. Oh, gosh. Grog? Do you have any ale? I think I need a drink. I really need a drink. Are we all doing perception rolls? He mentioned the left. Wait, why did he say that? Why did you say that? Are there any-- Do you mean, are there like-- is there any wildlife, any bats, any type of animals, anything like that? Okay, I'm going to-- I'm going to go ahead and cast Beast Sense on one of the bats. And I'm going to channel myself through the bat and I'm going to make him fly down the far left tunnel. Can I just see-- Wow, guys, this is really trippy. Well, I didn't really see much, but definitely there is a pretty steep incline. We could try it again and go down the other one. Decline. There he goes! Grog, Grog! Don't run too far ahead-- He's gone. No. I can't, today. I'm sorry. I can make it really foggy. I could do that. I can make it look like a-- Well, that's a different story. #kimawashere. Ooh! Are we being chased right now? Are people hot on our tail? I need to sleep. Yeah, two to a tent. We can each have our own tent! There's enough. I need to sleep as well. Don't trust it! I'm still passed out. Totally forgot I fell asleep! Oh, cool. We're playing pillar pinata. Yeah. That's good. Before we leave, I wanna go ahead and take a minute to meditate. If you guys can, you know, just watch while I meditate. Yes, if you guys could lend your positive energy it would be very helpful. So I can Commune With Nature. I want to do Commune (pronouncing incorrectly) With Nature. Yes, or Commune, whatever. Yeah, I want to start a commune in nature. Commune in commune in a commune. That one. Just read it, where is it? Three miles. Lots of bats. They're very nice bats Very pleasant, they're very friendly. That's about it. Okay, carry on, let's go. Thank you for your positive energy. Ooh. Grog, it's only 930 in the morning. For christ's sake. So wait, we get a chance to chat for a second? Pike, did you ever fully tell us what all you saw in your vision? I mean, have you perhaps had any more visions? What? Soul matter? Concentrated evil. Like the horn of Sauron? No whales, no narwhals. Horn of evil. The place we're heading. We haven't seen that. Oh no. Ooh. It sounds amazing, that doesn't sound shitty. That's Yug'Voril? That's Yug'Voril? Trip him again! So the ultimate question is, are we heading the right way? Are we heading the right way, Pike, do you know? If we learned anything from Minecraft-- (all laugh) Oh, yeah! Run! That's not too bad, could be worse. What are we fighting? What are we fighting? What are we fighting, we don't know. Lava pools, Lava pools. Grog, you better be throwing bitches into that lava. Hashtag bitches in lava! Bitches in lava, bitches in lava. ASHLEY and 13 as well. Hell, yeah! Ooh! Oh. Collateral damage. It's bound to happen. Pick me. What did we open? Oh, great. What is that? We just opened Pandora's box. Great. That's good. Good. Black ooze. How do I handle that? (sing) We're up all night in the dark. Pew pew. Well, yeah. What if it's like a sentient alien lifeform? You know, like some Spiderman shit. Some alien lifeform shit. Yeah. Oh! No. Fuck. But it didn't split, right? MATT and That's cool. It's a perk. Okay. I wanna move, kind of be like, whoops, sorry, 'scuse me, pardon me, and come like heresies. Would you say that I'm 30 feet away from that guy? Will my Thorn Whip reach him? My 30-foot-range Thorn Whip? I'm gonna try and Thorn Whip him! Huh? Well, it does 2d6 damage, it's a 30-foot range, and it pulls 10 feet. Notes I have on it-- Okay-- piercing damage-- if they are large or smaller, you pull the creature up to ten feet closer. Piercing. I hit. I don't hit. That's funny. Okay. I didn't roll yet. No. What do I add, my spell modifier? 18. 19, sorry, it's actually 19. One piercing damage, but I pull him ten feet closer to me. Does he go into the lava? And I've got him on a leash now. Nope. Oh, okay. Okay. Ooh, yeah! Ooh! (all cheer) Rage, urine, and death. What? What the dice rolled? Yeah. Nothing, he likes it, feels good. Just helped with that itch you couldn't scratch. You're being attacked by jello. Really bad jello. It's, like, fridge experiment jello. Coffee jello? No. Clarota didn't see? Where was Clarota? Why was he trailing? What the fuck? He's a slacker. He's a fucking slacker. All right. I'm not arguing with the DM, I'm calling Clarota a slacker. Damn it, Clarota. What are those? What is that? I like lava pools. I like lava pools. Vault the lava. Vault that lava. So they're all still alive, all the oozes are still alive. It was around here somewhere. You had it last. Did I have it? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Little ooze. On the little ooze? All the oozes are still alive? Damn oozes. All right. I'm gonna do something crafty. I'm gonna bamf into an eagle. I'm gonna fly over-- I think I'm going to land right by here. Uh-huh. And I'm gonna do Thunder Wave. Which is-- So I'm coming out of eagle form. I was just using the eagle to fly. Coming out of eagle form, and I'm gonna do my thunderpush. So I take my staff and I throw it down. Kerplash. Today it's kerplash. Kerplash! It's a 15-foot cube and it pushes everything ten feet away from me. Directly away. Sure. Yeah, a cube in front of me. Not Grog, though. I'm gonna just-- 2d8. Six. It just says damage and then they're pushed. I was-- Ten feet. Directly away from me. I was hoping they would go into the lava. Yep! Aim for in front of the Scientology Center. It always goes over really well. Double-fatigue? Son of a bitch. No shit. Pseudopod? Did he just call it a 'pseudopod'? Oh! Yeah you do. Yeah. No Lightning Bolt, Clarota. (sings) One little two little three little oozes. In his pooper. Uh-huh. Yeah, Scanlan. Do I have enough speed to get next to Vex there? 30 feet? Is that Vax? All right, once again, I'm going to Thorn Whip this bitch. 26. Eight points of damage. And I pull him-- So I take my Thorn Whip, and I go (whip sound). And I grab him. And I see he's still struggling. So I take another one and I go (whip sound) on the other one. And I just go Spiderman-style. And just for flavor, I take a big gust of air, a big Wind Burst and I go (whoosh) down into the lava pool. Encrusting it all. I don't care. No shame. That's true, if we keep going. I might be able to guide him-- Yay, Grog! Now we pass out. Oof. Ah, me too. Yes, everyone on this side of the table's good. And now you don't have it no more? That is funny. Oh! That's a good idea. What the fuck did we open? Yeah. Can I go and grab shards of the broken glass of the case? Sorry. It looped around? Well, we should go pick up Trinket. Let's go pick up Trinket. We left Trinket over there. We're at the bottom of the cave. Son of a bitch. So it's not useless. Is there, like, any other way down here? Can I-- While I see it real quick, I'm going to go ahead and channel and cast Beast Sense through it. Good to know. Aboleth. Well, we took a wrong turn, I guess. Yeah, I like it. Huzzah. Thanks for being a fan. We keep getting knocked unconscious. You don't get angry? Have you played Dark Souls or Demon Souls? Because--
