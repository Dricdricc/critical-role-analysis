Nailed it! You know our friend's name. (loud whisper) Yeah. Are there? Go volunteer! Go start a D&D club! Hit them up! Kids and D&D are hilarious. Represent! Hometown! Well, not really. An hour and a half outside my hometown! Yeah. We're Alive just came out on Project Alpha with the amazing horror aficionado Ivan Van Norman. It's awesome. It's based off of the "We're Alive" podcast; it's "We're Alive Frontier." It's, oh man, you guys have to go watch it. Next week is the first episode of my new show with Mr. Matt Key Key Question! That's on Tuesday. It's going to be good. It's got some good shit in it, been looking at the edits. So yeah. Go watch. Available where you can find all babies. I like Bladder Kick. That one's my favorite. The baby is being watched by so many people. You're definitely live-streaming the birth though, right? He's the coolest. He didn't seem very irreverent in the way the Traveler seems to be. No, but I hang out with you. He was. Is that your first time killing something? Or somebody? Yeah, you did that, though. I am too. Who ended up grabbing the goggles? Did I grab the goggles? I got them off the priest! I'm going to pull them out, take a look at them. I put them on. Too late, man. It's like Thir13en Ghosts (screams). No, I don't know. Holy shit, you guys. Is this what you can see all the time? It's like I got night vision! Like I can see... things! I can deal with that, it's fine. I can see shit! Lies. Do you want me to see through your clothes? Nah. Do you want to go to-- What is it? That's rad. Nein. You look like you're into some shit. Yeah, I was going to say, it's a lot of good metal. We can always sell it for scrap metal. Didn't we get a pendant off of the priest? Yeah. So it is magical? I have a feeling that no one in this town could afford it right now. But when we get to-- Zadash. I might know a few contacts that might want something. I know people everywhere. Was it on the priest? I have it. I got it. I've got my goggles on and I'm just like-- Ah! (laughter) I pull out the oven mitt. What's with the oven mitt? Wait, it hurts people so you're going to hang onto it? It doesn't matter if I know how to use arcane artifacts. Stuff that hurts people could still be beneficial to our cause, because other people want to hurt us. Yeah, why don't you see if Fjord wants it? I wonder if it works on animals. Back to the glove thing, though. Exactly. It's not fair for you to put your issues onto literal inanimate objects. No. I can't use arcane shit. But he can. Give him the damn paper. Okay, you didn't frame it that way, though. You put it under the guise of this is bad, this hurts people. I'm just wondering what your deal is. Yeah. That's not the issue. But cheers! Huzzah. How many rooms do they have at the inn? Let's buy them all out. I'll take my own room if y'all don't want in. Then come join me, girl! Done. I paid for me. Here, for giving you shit earlier. I give three silver. I go up and head up to the room as well. He can't even hear about it! Beau just reaches over and hands her a kleenex. Nothing. I'm in the room with you. I'm reading. While she was doing that, I'm opening the letters from the Baumbauchs. (kissing sounds) What is it? Nice. Would I recognize what this word means? Do I get any time of advantage for being a shifty person? Is this a code? Is this backwards? This is backwards, isn't it? Fuck balls. Eight. Toordolbo. Do I know what the Evening Nip is? Do I recognize that? I finish reading everything, I go over to a sleeping Jester, pull her blankets up and tuck her in a little bit, and then I crash out. Hey, Jester? I want to show you something. You know how I stole some shit from the Baumbauchs on our way out of town? Most of it's boring shit, but I stayed up and I was trying to solve it and figure some of this stuff out. Take a look at this, what do you think? (whispering) The Gentleman. Who's the Gentleman? Uh-huh, I wanted to put a reminder for myself. No, the Baumbauchs don't make ros√©. You're right. The place where I came from, you got-- certain regions are going to make certain kinds of wines. That might tell us where it's come from. And, what do you think-- I think the "oblodoro" I think that's a code. I think it's bloodroot. That sounds like a thing, right? That's a possibility. I haven't ruled anything out yet. Do I know of bloodroot? Nature check. Better than me. 13. And they're wanting an extract, so-- Are the Baumbauchs trying to poison people?! No. Just keep it in the back of your head if you hear something, if something spikes your interest-- --or about a Gentleman. And an Evening Nip. I want to know about these evening nipples-- evening nip. How many days has it been? Interesting. Let's keep this-- we'll workshop it. You-- Yeah we did, we definitely did. Let's get some food. There were the two. 570 for the gnolls, 35 for the-- 150 gold a piece! Hey there new guy, you know good words that like sound cool in Zemnian right? Nein! At the Leaky Tap? Not Tavern, Tap. I wrote down Dermis, yeah! My high school German teacher's first language was Spanish. It was real weird. I don't remember her name. And your mother's The Ruby of The Sea? I have now. Have I heard of her? Don't fuck me. That's a natural one. Is that what that song is about? I'm so glad I set that up. No regrets. (singing) The Ruby of the Sea is the best lay ever! (singing) The Ruby of the Sea, the best lay ever! Did she tell people about you? Did she teach you your spell and fighting talents? Yeah, we'll-- keep talking. How many people saw? That's so great! That's not great. Yeah. What's wrong with being in a girdle? Very waist cinching. Skirt. That's pretty crazy. So you think you can actually-- hang on, why do you want to live with your dad that you never met? Why not just go do your own thing? Sometimes fathers are disappointing. Very in shape. That was smooth. I'm into it. Yeah, the hero worship is kind of nice. It's so true. Yeah, let's leave while we're on a high note. Hey, Caleb. Do you have kids? Did you have kids? Insight check. 14. You just have some paternal qualities. Just you know-- No. I think I just pulled a rib. There's shit cracking. Something popped. I was trying to defend the table. I'm going to take some Advil. Uh-huh? Don't make me laugh! This is some bullshit. Therapeutic D&D right now. I put on my goggles way too early. I'm super stoked about them. (laughter) Yeah, totally! 100 percent! That's kind of how I imagined them is Burner goggles. I'll take the last. Seven. We did scoop up those chains, right? We put those in the wagon? Metal's valuable, man. What kind of cargo does it look like they have? As she's doing that, I'm trying to get Jester's attention. I'm like Jester! Jester! 13. (whispers) The Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Do any of them look-- Like a gentleman. I think they thought we were patronizing them. We kind of were, though. What? Nine! Are they mightier than us, though? Green and black? That's weird. Oh my god, we're fighting the Ninja Turtles! Wait, do they have them? Oh my god, brilliant! Yeah, look out for that manticore head. They're diseased. Oh, come on. Do it. Syphilis is intimidating, though. Fuck their shit up! Fucking punch him in the face! Yeah, and I'm looking for the first crossbow bolt that's going to go towards one of my friends and try and deflect it. Am I near Caleb? Who am I near? I'll protect Caleb. He just pissed them off. Yeah. You busted out the lollipop? (sings) Lollipop, lollipop, ooh lolli-lolli-lolli, lollipop, lollipop-- Is that a natural 20 on the-- Come on, Duraflame, come on. I was holding my action for that crossbow bolt. For one at him. Yeah, that's a nine, plus seven. Can I go ahead and burn a ki to go back? Bam. Doing that shit. d10 plus my dex-- d10? Oh, in terms of damage. Fuck. Yes. I think I do, right? That's a 15 naturally. And then, so d10. Fuck. That's a fucking one. Five points of damage. That's lame. Damn it. If I would've rolled one fucking higher. Yeah, your headbands are lame, but I want them. Oh, yes you will. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do it! Come on. Yeah. Well, you were barely paying attention. Molly, if I will, I feel like our money should still buy something, you know, a service. We teach these good men to make money based on the services they provide. You all have one fucking job, you go and you tell all your stupid friends No fucks with the Mighty Nein. But spelled N-E-I-N. The Mighty Nein. Don't forget it. That's all I got. Sorry, I caught one of them. (laughter) He's all right. He'll be fine. He's going to feel great when he wakes up. I take Crapper. One lone cake pop. What happened to those clothes and that horse? I bet that horse made a great gift for someone else, you probably made somebody really happy. Maybe a little girl who wanted a horsie for her birthday. Oh my god, it totally is! Scrap metal. I roll Caleb over and make sure he's not face-down in the dirt. I cover him up, he's fine. One day we're going to have a real big talk about your issues. Yeah, it's literally been about ten minutes. Camping sucks. Aww! (whisper chants) Scrap metal! Scrap metal! Scrap metal! Julous what? Wow. We can still sell that for scrap metal, though, right? Yeah. I've lived here my whole life. It's kind of lame. Never been that far. Been a lot of places in Dwendalian, but not that far. They're on the outskirts. The further on the outskirts you go, the more tolerable they are. Further north we go...? It's-- I'm just telling you, the more north we go, the stricter it's going to get. You're going to see more and more of the empire and its influence. Of course they will. It's where all the money is. Farts and vultures. Never mind. Yeah. I toss him a silver. East? I don't know, I didn't catch it. I got Claudia Sheed. But Bryce grew up in the west. How much? Stanneras. Let me take you to the shadiest place, tourist. Yeah! (chants) Den mama! Den mama! You're insight checking-- This is our first chain whisper. Is D and D Beyond. With an N. Little hitch in it. DND. So soon. Like a people mover? Like Disney! They have a monorail in Zadash! I did. That's a good name for her, Chastity Nook. Yeah, that's good. Not yet. You used to be a regular? Was? That's telling, yeah. What shop did you used to own? Are you a craftsman in the trade? I mean, a businessman can sell anything, right? Why don't you get back into it? You still have all those connections. Fair. The Signet Wall? Do you know a good blacksmith? Maybe he'll want that helmet. Do things shut down in an hour here? I've been here. Do I know that it stays? Do they keep later hours? I'd like to say maybe selling our shit now. That way it doesn't get robbed in the night. I think the Pentamarket's that way. I've got a hunch. We can just slide by and see. Small detour. Like New York compared to L.A.? Okay. 13 plus four is 17. Caleb. I think this is going to be where you're going to stock up on your incense and some other goodies. I'll join in that. I'll wait back. This guy's our new Gilmore, you guys! Five hundred hours later we're fighting gods with him! Poor Matt's soul! There's a fourth? I thought there was three. Giving a good deal. (whispering) Seven days. A handbag of endless bottom. A Bag of Holding? Is he beating us at our own game? Regular potion, regular potion. We buy pastries for Jester. A solid baker's dozen. If you want one. Do you want one? No, Fjord's good. One of my favorites. Nyquil does some weird shit.
