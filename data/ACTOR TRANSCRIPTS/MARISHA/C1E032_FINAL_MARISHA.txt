How's the weather in New York? Never can forget. Never forget. The Deck of Many Things. Yeah! Yeah. Go listen to it. It's like what Laura said last week; it's like weird because it's kind of like a vulnerable soft spot, but yeah. Journey songs. Go check them out. Geek and Sundry website. Right. But you should go to Geek and Sundry's website because we each wrote little descriptions. And we also each picked out some of our favorite fan arts that we've gotten. And it's Christmas coming up, man. They're up? They're below us? We look hot. Yeah, Grog has a beard. Look at Grog and his beard over there. It's over there. Yeah, they have it in order as to what we're sitting. And we've all been playing it. Foaming at mouth! Yeah, who else is in it? Anyone else? LIAM, LAURA, SAM, and Just Matt? We recently found you, though. And what's funny was, his character, McCreedy, he starts bitching at you for picking up a lot of junk, which Matt does to me in real life. Yeah, Matt was like, "Do I really?" And I was getting it from two fronts. I'm like, "God damn it." I'm a hoarder. I need more toy cars. I don't have enough screws! Screws are fucking hard to come by. Thanks for seeing us. And the hospital was amazing. It's a good hospital. Oh yeah; they have a giveaway library, where they give a book to a kid every day. Yeah. So we're actually going to be talking about that later, but they apparently have a book wishlist, so we're going to be getting that from them and sharing it to you guys because these people need books. Yeah, high five! We're high-fiving and no one knows about what we're high-fiving over. So we have a fun new announcement for everybody. Aren't you excited? You're so ready. Okay, so, Critical Role is finally getting a weekly comic strip. Yes! Yes! (laughter) We're getting a comic, you guys. It's starting off as a comic strip. So it is going to be coming-- In newspapers everywhere online if the website is named GeekandSundry.com. So, everywhere. Yes, and so it's going to be starting next Wednesday. They're going to be releasing weekly on Wednesdays. I know. The first run that we're going to do-- they're going to be semi-episodic, I guess, like loose story line little vignettes. And the first storyline is going to be our Winter's Crest festival. So it'll be thematic. It will go all the way up until Christmas, and our first artist is the amazing Wendy Green, wendydoodles. (cheering) Yes. You'll see Much to come. Not yet, next week. Next week. The first one goes out on Wednesday. So the more people who go and look at it, the more we may get later. Yes. We want to see how far this ship will sail. We can't leave. I'm running back. I'm going back towards the skeletons. I break from Vax's grasp and start running back Athletics. Ooh, I rolled an 18. I start conjuring up a 4th-level Flaming Sphere. Flaming Sphere. Okay, how far away is the horde? Okay, here's my question. Are they funneling down one main street? How wide is that street? Okay, with my flaming sphere hovering above me, I'm going to throw up a wall of stone. Conjure a barrage first. (scoffs) Only 12. Okay, I throw up a wall of stone. Am I near the Sun Tree again? Okay, so what I'm going to do is, I want to conjure it from underneath me, so as I see them filtering up, I want to pop it up right from underneath me to where I'm on top of it. Ten feet. Ten foot by ten foot panels. Ten feet. So I'm going to take the fire sphere, and just start funneling it right down and start cleaning house. Just yeah, right into the thick mess of them. Oh my God. Keyleth thinks she died. Keyleth thinks she's dead. Pike, did we die? No, he critted. I cast it at 4th-level, so it's doing 5d6 right now. They have to make dexterity saving throws. Oh, really?! Cheerleader boost. This is going to be so badass. So badass. She accidentally rolled a d10, so she was re-rolling for a d20, and she rolled a natural 20. Yes. Oh yay! Come on, Pike. There's, like, 80 skeletons he has to roll for. Yeah. (laughs) I know. (laughter) She rolled a natural 20. Good craftsmanship. Tea time? I dodge a femur. Have to have a conversation. Oh, fuck. One. I don't think we have a choice. Split the party! I say we do it; fuck it, let's split the party. One take east, one take west. Spellcasters should split up. I'll go without-- what did you just say? Hey, we started something; we can't stop. Let's go! We'll go east. Although remember, the signal's a little weak. Oh god! He picked up a sword and went running back into battle. Fine, fuck it. You ready for this, Grog? Oh man, I'm so excited. Yeah, me too, a little horrified. Does Trinket-- where's Trinket? Oh, we're riding Trinket. You're riding Trinket, okay. It just happens. What? Yeah, it's radiant, it should do more against him. Single attack. All right. Don't forget about your weapon master thing. Yeah, that one. I know. (laughs) Holy shit. Nice! That is a ten. Fuck! (laughter) Nice. For every roll. For both attacks. 23 on the first hit. They'll understand. Me, too. I like your headphones, too, by the way. She's gone. She ran away. She took her headphones off and did a lap. Vaguely west. Yeah, let's run. I'm just running. Keyleth's running. Damn it! It's the second one I've rolled in a row. Yeah, I'm distracted. Come on, Percy roll! He's got shitty AC. Damn it. (groans) Fuck! Nice. Okay, so you're on him. But there's a ton of people surrounding him. Okay. I'm going to kill everybody if I start bringing down bolts of lightning. So I'm going to move up a little bit, to where I'm within 30 feet of him. Over here or something? Can I see Vax? Okay. So, looking at the giant and realizing that if I bring lightning down, I'll just start electrocuting everybody around, I meditate for a second and go super calm and start casting Heat Metal, and I start meditating on Vax's daggers. So your daggers are going to do an extra 2d8 damage. And he's up against a wall, correct? Okay, I'm going to use my bonus. I'm running fucking low on spells. Fuck, I don't want to do it. I'm going to do my bonus action to cast Grasping Vine. Okay. It's because it worked that way in Pathfinder. I used to do that with Grog's axe all the time. Thanks, Sam. My spell save DC? 18. I'm like, yeah. We're going to hurt this motherfucker so bad. Bonus action, I'm going to wrap him up with a Grasping Vine and try to restrain him. I'm like, man, I'm such a fucking badass right now. What am I doing? Yeah. I think he has to save against it. Fucking fail. Yeah, can I pull him towards the center of the earth? Thanks, man. Man, I'm so cool right now. I'm concentrating so hard! And she's like, well, deal with it! It's going to be awesome! Kill something. And he's grappled. So does he, right? Because that's kind of badass. Seven points of damage. Does he also get the fire damage? I go up to start seeing if I can salvage anything from this giant. Do I see Vax with his hands in the mud? What did-- what? Oh. Did it work, though? I'm sorry. Okay. I put my hands in his hands and cast Cure Wounds. I'm going to use it from my ring. My spell-slot ring. I'll do level two. 12. Before he runs off, I tell him, "Tell everyone to look for the sign of "Pelor in the sky." What time is it right now? It could be cursed. Can I salvage anything from the stone giant? Just a wisdom check? 12 total. Head west, meet up. Pike, we've missed you so much. How did you get here, Pike? How did you know? Yeah, can you take a look at him, Pike? I believe it's out of my realm of understanding. There was a long pause. This isn't going to last long. Yeah, I have a feeling she's probably using a lot of energy to do this, too. Pike, do you know how much longer you can stay in this form, that you can stay with us? Get inside? He's had this weird cough for a couple of days now. We'll have her look at you there. I do a Gust to do that air umbrella thing around all of us. Yeah, the really terrible one. I'm doing that to help keep us shielded from the rain. 17. Come on, city boy. (laughs) Oh shit. Can I do a nature check to see if this is natural or man-done? I think that's a 21. Yeah, 21. I think this was blasted down. Good work, Grog. If they've blasted in the entrance, I have a feeling-- They're not expecting people. Are we inside? Let's all crawl in. I light up my hands. Yeah, take a look at him, Pike. Okay. (sighs) That's the question. It depends on if we're going to decide to-- I'll think about it. I did a check on him, Pike. His cough doesn't seem to be anything natural or disease-related, so it's nothing like a fever. Not a real one, anyway. (quietly) Come on, Pike. If you have a Greater Restoration, Pike-- I don't have it on me. A corruption point? So does that get rid of one of his weird ailments? What did you just do to him, Pike? Where did you go just then? This room won't fit my storm cloud. Why? No, it's not going to work. Who's still awake? I look at Vax before we go to sleep, and I say, not going to pull any more jenga moments, are you? You sure? Because you just did that secret walkaround there. We notice when you sneak off. You do know that, right? Okay. Hey. I was the only one who didn't give you shit for that. Just keep that in mind. Corruption, man. Son of a fuck. Natural one. My third of the evening. I had bad dreams. I keep my hands aflame and kind of rub myself. Glad I don't use a bow. That sounds good, yeah. I will say, if we choose to feast, I will not be able to Sunbeam. I couldn't. I burned my Sunbeam. We couldn't have done it. I don't know if Pike-- Does she have access to sixth-level spells? We haven't leveled Pike up in a while. So she would have a sixth-level spell. It depends on if clerics have it. But that would also mean Pike burning her 6th-level spell slot. I can Skywrite again. I just need to move the boulders a bit. We're the most capable people in this town right now. They've got Yennan. He's awesome. He was a badass cleric. We're going to eat up? Fuck yeah. Yes, I believe we need to go shopping. Pike, you wouldn't happen to have a thousand gold-worth chalice on you, would you? Never mind. Don't worry about it. 2d10 or 2d8. 2d12? And we're immune to fear. And poison, I think. Immune to fear, immune to poison, and immune to what else? I'm going to move out some rocks. Just enough where I can peek out. Are we ready to go? I'm just going to start this. We can talk as we go. I'm going outside. I'm going outside. Is it still rainy? Still cloudy? Okay, so I take the clouds and I darken them and do a giant de Rolo crest that expands over the whole city. To the de Rolos. To Whitestone. To Vox Machina. Do that Ben and Jerry's pint. (laughter) I light up my hands for light. Can I do an arcana check to see? If it's magical? Magic trap? Natural 20. Making up for those fucking ones. Is it carved out of the rock? Got you. But it's not magically trapped? And if we touch it, we're not going to be possessed or something. I don't think so. I'm sorry. Fucking doors! Doors. He's helping. Ooh, I rolled a 19! Wait, is this just a strength check? Straight strength? 21. (grunts) I turn around and I'm still pushing. Charge at it. It must be nice to have the strength of Sarenrae. Is there anything good in the storage room that we're in? Yeah. That's not great. Eight. Yeah, I pick up a few pieces too. Are we sure they're prisoners? 21. Yeah, why don't we unlock her and just let her book for it? I do. Nothing. I can dispel magic. It's a spell. It's a 3rd-level spell. I mean, I can do it. Yeah, they were going to eat her. Do you know if anyone else is in the dungeon down here with you? Vax, you're the only one who can pick the lock. We don't have keys. I'm assuming she's locked in there, right? Someone's sleeping. Yeah, which one was the old lady in? Is there, do we see anyone else in any of the cells? Perception? Oh my god, it's Ripley! Oh my god, it's Ripley! Sorry. I'm saying that as Marisha. Not as Keyleth. Saying that as a person. I'm sorry. Oh my god, Ashley. It's one, no, 2AM there. It's just pick-ups, right? We love you, Ashley, please come back next week. Can that astral connection hold? (air kisses) And comic comes out on Wednesday. This coming up Wednesday. And yeah, go check out all of our playlists. There'll be a fun playlist next week.
