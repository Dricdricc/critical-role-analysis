Is there a buzzer system? On Halloween. I will say I had a cat dress up as my character, so the bar is pretty high. --balanced breakfast! I did, very much so. A little bit of Yenk, a little bit of dragon. Dragon. I patiently wait for the tree. I don't want to interrupt. That's rude. Nature, right? With advantage. Oh, that's good. 28. Yeah. You're going to be like Mr. T. Hi. Man, how long of a jog is that? Man, ooh, Vex isn't here. Oh no, wait, no. Hold on. Yes, I'm working right here on this area and Vex wants a claw. And blood. More bang for our buck. Parking garage, that's where it's at. What did we find? (laughter) Oh jeez. Oh boy. Well we now apparently have 150 pounds. Blood. Eyes. No. Yeah, I'm going to go into the mansion as well. Keyleth has laid out the Vorgual spoils like she got back from a yard sale. Grog, can you help me see how much we can shove in here? Here, maybe like a sleeping bag, and I'll sit on it and you can wrap it up? Okay, we'll do that. Try and shove as much as we can. (squishing) Three vials of dragon blood in the Bag of Colding. And we have six talons. Okay, so we have six talons, 20 teeth and 150 pounds of hide. Word. It could take days to potentially melt the ice, right? And I also have this. My new toy. Does it look fancy? Is it magic? I can't. Wait, can I? No, I can't. I've actually had a lot of rocks that are friends. Yeah, I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. I attune to my staff. Currently my Ring of Protection. Can I do a check on the potion since I've got alchemy training? That's what I thought it was. The yellow one? For one minute after you drink this potion, you have resistance to all damage. The potion's syrupy liquid looks like liquefied iron. And then Potion of Speed when you drink this potion, you gain the effects of Haste spell for one minute. Which one, the Potion of Speed? Yeah, do you want to take the speed potion, Grog? Give the invulnerability to Laura. Who wants to keep it? What'd she get? What's it do, Kima? I run downstairs to the training area with my staff. They're both metal, right? I can help you by heating metal, actually. I'm going to go test this out, and I'll meet you in the workshop. I'll be right back. Yeah, I want to see what this does. It's a free mansion, man. Ooh-hoo. Okay. All right. Everyone stay back. I'm going to start by casting the lowest level of spell out of it, see what it does. Apparently a Fireball. Whatever is further in the sandpit. I told everyone to stand back. Did you see that, Grog? That was awesome. 20, and they recharge at the top of a day. They recharge 1d6 plus four. 1d6 plus four. Because I've been really excited about this one, I'm going to point at the other dummy and cast Chain Lightning. Grog. Did you see that? Really? Hmm, I don't think so. I can try this though! Hang on, wait, that was five charges. No sorry, six charges. Burning through all the charges, but I don't care. Watch this Grog, watch this. I'm going to do Conjure Elemental. What elemental? Earth! Then I do a bonus action and I also turn into an earth elemental. Yes I did. Then we walk by and we Top Gun each other. Then we both turn and look at Grog. Then I punch Grog in the face! Natural one! That was for me! He gets a plus eight. (gruffly) I did that on purpose. Okay, I drop my form to hear what Grog has to say. Really? Did it hurt you when we punched you? Well. And I tell the elemental to-- Attack Grog again. Fucking shit. How was that? Really? Yeah? Man, this staff is so powerful. Jeez, wow. I can keep burning the fucking charges. Yes, I know. Goddamn it. I hope we're not fighting anything so I can recharge these. No, it's a damage-dealer. I'm going to wait. I'm going to see. I'm going to save some action. Real fast, just in case-- and I whack him with the staff. My strength and my-- Let's see, 18. No wait, 19! Wow, really? Oh, it gave you acid reflux? That's good to know. It induces sickness? Okay, good to know, all right, thank you. I'm good for now. And now I go. Aw, we haven't done shit! And the Spire! Geek & Sundry's twitter. Do you want to rest before we do that? You guys got into the wine?! Are we still melting a mask to a helmet? I help him with my Heat Metal spell like a soldering iron. Big money, no whammies! It's magnificent. Shall we present it to him? I feel like we should go at this with a little bit of theatricality. Just because it's so much fun to fuck with Grog. How do you want to do this? Oh! I turn into an elephant. Get on my back! Yes, I do! Get on my back! Percy's on my back and I'm an elephant holding the mask while we go find Grog. It's a temporary fucking mansion. I bust through. I don't know how to-- Will you put this in dice jail for me? I don't know. What do I roll for a-- Well, I don't know what an elephant's stats are! Well, I rolled a two! Yeah, a two. I'm a fucking elephant and it's a door! Can I try it again? That's much better! 16 total! They get better with each time. 19! I should have thought about this! No, go with it. Go with it. How much damage? What's my form? I fucking headbutt him, I'm going to gorge him! Let's go! What do I add? I don't have a stat. 18. Do I knock down the doorway a little bit more? Okay. 20 total. Don't fuck me, Gil. Rolling your die! Wait, a d20 minus one? (laughing) Six total. Goddamn it Gil. I'm still wearing my cloak, so do they get disadvantage on attacks against me? Because I'm in the Cloak of Displacement. But whenever I Beast Shape I absorb my items. But they're just now rolling. (heavy footsteps) (pained noise) Oh, Grog, thank you! That elephant ate me! You saved me! You did. The elephant ate this too. No, it's good. I wrote it down. I knew it was going to be handy. I think it's a scam, and I throw it away. So wait, do we need things-- how far under the ice is it? Reforestation. Oh, sure because the Ice Age wiped out-- Yeah! I didn't know you are an artist. It's pretty amazing, yes. I appreciate this. What is it? Sylvan, Primordial, Druidic, Elven. How much is exposed right now? I cast a Flaming Sphere. Where does it look like the most convenient entrance? With ice and stuff? All right, I'm going to concentrate my Flaming Sphere on that and start melting it. About a minute, I think? How much was it? Oh, fuck that. I step back. I cast a Gust cantrip over top of him to keep ice from falling on him. Me too. I also back out. Eight. (coughing) Do you think it has some sort of icy-like-- I could try, and maybe now that the ice is broken I can melt it through it easier? Some people like collecting ships, you know? Maybe he's a nautical kind of guy. Right, yeah. Never mind. Hold on, did we maybe get-- is Thordak going to-- we should go. Percy, want to leave a mark anymore? I approach Tooma. (clears throat) Tooma, it's time that we make our departure very soon. I want to thank you so much for everything that you provided and everything that your people have done. Of course. I would love to help and leave some parting gift in any way that I can. What was your land like before Vorugal got here? I know it wasn't as icy and as frigid. I can attempt to maybe revitalize your plant life as much as I can before I leave. I can. You have a good, strong people and I want to see your recovery. Just like I hope the same with mine. Anything that I can do. I go up to the group. Percy, Vax, I need to take time with this, so are you all all right spending the rest of the day here while I help them? All right. I ascend to the top of the ravine and I start meditating, and I cast Plant Growth. Yeah. Third. And I'm doing the eight-hour-- Yep. Sorry. I start doing that and revitalizing their landscape as close to what it was before, giving their-- [no audio] Okay. Well, I talked to Tooma and find out where she-- That's what I thought, yeah. In the eight hour one that's like, crazy. All right. Do you plan to still reside there? I'll do what I can. And I go there. Vax is shorter than Scanlan. That's a good title.
