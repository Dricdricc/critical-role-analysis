Awesome times? Good times, good time together. We're doing a panel, aren't we? Yeah, it is at PetCo Park, so don't get lost looking around the convention center. Because it won't be there. It's at PetCo Park. We're working it out. How's New Jersey? On river time, what? Did you instantly turn into a 64-year-old golfer as soon as you went there? Well, I think the intro-- Makes it too real. What's going on? And we can see you more. Yeah. (laughs) Travis takes up this side of the frame. (crow sound) (laughter) Yeah. Ah ha! Oh right, Brady Bunch style! Hi, Travis. Everyone looks right? So if we're looking this way, "Hi, Matt!" Yeah. We're still kind of confused. Go ahead and bring him on? You can come say hi. Oh, we probably could have been going for a while. We've just been like dicking around. Sam's here! Hi, Sam. (laughs) You don't listen, anyway. Well, we just-- so we fought off the wyverns. Yeah, his beard. Let's go for the beard. Yep. I have some beads. If you want, we can braid it and put beads in there. Okay! And put beads in it. And a few flowers, as well. It looks nice. Looks good! You'll get used to it. Can I do a nature check to see if this seems to be natural or arcane? Okay, that's a 10 plus-- 20, total. No! Write it right here! I throw up a slate. I'm sorry. Aww. Oh, man. (gasps) It's snowing. There was something I should probably tell you. In this area of land, in Vasselheim, on this continent, somewhere, I'm not sure where, resides the Fire Ashari. Somewhere in the town of Pyrah. Well, they're my sister tribe. They're a part of my sister tribe. I come from the Air Ashari. Yeah, from Zephra. Yeah, so there are Fire Ashari. So the point behind the Ashari-- I'm not sure I have expressed this to you all in the past few months. The point of our tribe is we sought out the weakest points where the elemental planes start to bleed with our plane of existence, and these planes need to be protected, so our people have sought them all out in order to make haven there and be the protectors that we were all born to be. And as part of my Aramente, I have to seek out each of the headmasters and prove myself a worthy leader. Which makes me really nervous. So I just thought, you know, maybe after we handle the Horn, maybe we can pop in. You know, since we're here. Oh. That could be good. Oh, that sounds fun! Well, they kind of teach me new things. They kind of instill me with their knowledge. I could. I know! I'm so excited! But yes. Super nervous, because social skills aren't my strongest suit. Oh, you guys. Yes. Yes. What? What? Well, yes. Yeah, no, we're all happy. I mean, that's kind of the thing, where once a generation someone sets out and goes on the Aramente in order to come back a headmaster, and it's kind of like our once-a-generation check-in, if you will, to make sure everything's okay. Unfortunately, the last person to go on the Aramente didn't come back, which happens sometimes. Yeah. No. It was actually my mother. I-- we don't know. She left when I was a little girl, so I don't remember much. So I don't know if she's alive or dead, really, but-- It's okay. It's okay. I mean, it's-- I mean. Well. It's fine. It's just. It's weird. I haven't seen her, so I don't know. I barely remember her. No. No. I wouldn't think so. Yeah, we're pretty-- we're cool. I'm assuming it would be okay. We're pretty welcoming. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be interesting. It's weird. There's this part of me in the back of my head that kind of always wonders if I'm going to run into her. I was five, six maybe, years old when she left. So I'm the next in line. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring the mood down. I'm just letting you know that we're going to be in that neck of the woods, so I should probably-- -- you know, go. Why did she say that? (laughs) I know! That was so weird, right? A siege. No. Oh, that's right. We went shopping. I remember. Yep. Oh, it's like a Sims thing. He's happy. Keyleth. Oh, so-- So am I correct to assume our plan is that we're going to march this Horn through the town? Until we get to the temple? I mean, we can only assume-- Yonn? How many people in this city are aware of this Horn being brought here? Highbearer Vor-- his name is Vord? We've basically walked into the Crucible. So wait, hang on, hang on, hang on. Before we move on-- we're about to leave, I'm assuming? Should a few of us kind of like flank around and-- Rooftop shit, yeah. I can go eagle form and have aerial support. Overwatch. What's that? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'm going eagle. Chicken through the magic door. Okay. So it's like New York. Is it sticking out like a sore thumb? Is it sticking out like a sore thumb? Damn, maybe we should've thrown a blanket or something over it. Burlap sack or something? Anybody? Percy, you've been so quiet here lately. Can I see inside the temple? Or are the temples pretty enclosed? Well, I was an eagle flying overhead. And I was gonna do a perception check to see if I noticed, like kinda do a loop of the temple. So I'm an eagle right now, so. 20 total. I'm gonna go check that out first. (eagle noises) Gonna see if I can figure out what's making the trees move. I'm flying! I'm fine. I have advantage because I'm an eagle. Ooh, natural 20! SAM and Okay. A common occurrence. Okay. Good to know. I'm going to loop back around. Is there like an open window in the temple that I can just fly through-- Be like that Windex commercial, back in the day. I break my neck, I die. Okay, I'll do that. Hi. Hi. I am with Vox Machina. I'm pretty sure they just came through the front door. It's cool. I was just doing-- just like aerial support. I'm just going to go and reconnect with my group. It's fine. I'm Keyleth. I'm not good at this shit. What am I doing? A persuasion check? Christ. Shut up. Oh, wait. I don't know why I'm rolling two. Six? Why? Yeah, it is. You know, can we just buzz by the front foyer, and then we'll find my friends, and then we'll all be like, hey, those are my-- It'll be fine. Shut up, Grog! The classic. Ouch. Yeah, I'm with her. Did you guys see that? I'm starting to feel so hardcore. I do need a tattoo. Oh. (gasps) This temple goes to six. Oh, that's right. Whoa. Do I see or learn anything about the elemental planes that I didn't know before? Ah, so pretty. We just made cave drawings, I don't-- Yeah. Kima, what's happening? Okay. Yeah-huh. We could have just told you that. Oh, man. Thanks, Yonn. He has seniority. So wait, you said you lost the Crystal of Exaltation during the War of-- During the War of what? Beginnings? The War of the Beginnings. And how long ago was this War of the Beginnings? It was created then? Called what? During what war? Oh. Just a siege. So just to get one thing clear, and I mean no (clears throat) disrespect, but how was the crystal lost 300 years ago, if it was in this chamber? So this chamber has been broken into before? Oh. Oh, so someone brought it out and then was clumsy and lost it. Oh. So it was destroyed. You should change your verbage here. Yeah, we're good. (laughs) No, he won't. A 30? (laughs) We've got to get you deceiving more. You should lie more. It's good. Sister. (laughter) Huh. Is there a blueprint somewhere? (laughs) It's like having your high-beams on when it's foggy. I go ahead and I do a little Wind Gust and I go, (blows air). Down the hall, to clear out the fog. Gust of Wind. Wait, do I still have one? My Gust of Wind-- My Gust of Wind lasts up to one minute, by the way, so I can keep-- I'm just airbending. Not much time. Wow. Son of a bitch. It's all right. Also 13. To who? The rest of us? Ouch. Okay. (weak chuckle) Let's move? Wait, hang on. Burning another spell slot. All right, here we go. Oh, no. He doesn't care. Thanks, I tried to get a little of a sage thing. A little orange blossom. It's nice. It's also pure oxygen, so we could get a little buzz. We made it! Oh! Yeah! Oh, it's like a mini-game. Holy shit. Oh my god. If you get crushed to death-- For a lever or something. Go, sharpshooters, go. I place my hands on her shoulders-- And I give her Enhance Ability. You have advantage on-- oh, ability checks. It's just ability checks. Never mind. (whispering) It's so quiet. A wrench in the machine. (laughs) Pretty damn close to impossible. So can we take a short rest to heal up and then also a short rest to take a short rest in real life? I'm going to do that. Oh my god, I rolled two eights in a row. That's awesome. They also just went up on our website, on critrole.com. So you can go to our website and find the link. Sam is tweeting it. Taylor! Nice. Tell them it's the last day. Paula Konito! Paula Konito! They're in the god-- MARISHA AND At least it'll be disinfected. Oh, that frickin' sound. Do we-- I can try to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, if we want to sneak through here. Do you want to try to sneak through? I cast Pass Without a Trace. I'm also going to cast Stoneskin. Dope. But they're spiders. They're probably not that wise. That's not bad! I'll take that. 17. Oh-ho-ho-ho. Wait, there he is. Get it! What's your DC, girl? What's yo digits? Gimme those stats. Must be something good. Ooh. That's cool. Nice! Okay, with that new development-- I can. I'm going to do Poison Spray, though. Where am I right now? I'm going to be like, 'scuse me, 'scuse me, Pike, 'scuse me. Sorry, sorry. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (whoosh) Poison Spray! It's a ten-foot cone. I'll do that. (whoosh) So, it's a constitution saving throw. Okay, so they take 2d12. Six. Ugh. Seven damage. It's not great. I think he takes half damage, though, even though he fails. Poison Spray. Oh, yeah, I guess so. Can I get out of everyone's way? Can I back up a little bit? Yeah. I just kind of want to-- yeah. Your turn! I moved behind. You're good, you're in front. You're only two squares away. Dope. Natural 20. (yelling) Is that all I know, with my natural 20? Hm. Gotcha. Hey, guys, I think these are like magical bamf-ing spiders. Yeah, let's kill them. That's not too depressing. It looks like flash paper? That can't be good. They poofed. Poofers. Oh, no, Percy! Oh, shit! Is that all it does, just poison him? Okay, that's not too bad. I did take Protection From Poison. If that's necessary. Fighting on the stairs. Squishy spiders. Are there any corpses that are more accessible than the one that got torched and the ones that are squished? Yeah, because I have that book that helps me do that now. What did the book do again, gave me a plus or an advantage? Did it give me an advantage on rolls or like a plus something? Oh, wait, you did ask me to write it down and I think I did. Oh, no, I didn't write it down, I just wrote that I have the books. That's better. 24. Two poison glands. I give them to the twins. I got this for you guys. Your book helps. No, we're good. Yeah. No. Yeah, but I cast Stoneskin on myself. Sorry. Come here, Trinket. (laughs) There's always a big mama spider. Also, I'll go ahead and-- nah, nah, it's fine. I'm going to keep my Stoneskin up. (whispers) Be very quiet. Ooh, good. Smarty-pants. Oh, they're purple. Mine has like a-- I've got like a scythe. You know, you make a good woman. Tiberiosa. Well, that's fun. Okay, you're good. Go for it, yeah. Yeah, I'm not going to move far away. No, no, no, no. Yeah, yeah, if I held-- let me shift one over, just so I'm not in Trinket's way. The other way. Yeah. Cool. That would be terrifying. Should we run? Yeah, who's going to be back down here, theoretically. Nice! 10d4? That's cool. For her thorns. My little sister once fell into a rose bush. It was very painful. That sucks, too. Oh. What is that? Okay. Yeah, sure. No. Kima? Skill challenge! We haven't done this in a while. Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, sure. 11? No! Too late, just leave them. How much of a gap is there between the last trailing-behind Scalebearer and the golem? I'm going to turn around and do Wall of Stone. Boof! Boof! Right, run. I still have it. I can Gust of Wind. That's my last 3rd-level spell. Including me? Just adding your wisdom? Saving throw or just your ability modifier? Okay, 16. (laughs) Bad car wash. Yeah, go home! Go home! Bad golem. We did it! I'm all right. I'm all right. Very good. That really heals me up, then. I'll take that. It could have gone worse. Yawn. Yeah! Oh, quick, Vorg-- Vord. Vord? You wouldn't have happened to hear of maybe a druid tribe called the Fire Ashari? They call their little hometown Pyrah. Do you happen to know, maybe? Is Sunder Peak like west or east to where we-- Southwest. Oh. So we can stop there first? We're going to miss you, Pike. But we understand personal journeys. We'll see you at Comic-Con.
