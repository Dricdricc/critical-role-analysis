He wants to see me directly. It's Avantika. 011453.052 --> 011457.933 There's a coup. She's trying to take over the city with a demon god. 011457.933 --> 011502.086 Not deception? 011506.702 --> 011508.715 Persuasion's not my best. 011512.484 --> 011515.120 Okay! 13? Above average? 011518.867 --> 011525.375 Time is of the essence. They're killing pirates who do not bend the knee to her. I've got 011538.358 --> 011540.995 to get to him now.

Will you at least walk with 014010.223 --> 014013.979 me? Time is of the essence here. 014015.179 --> 014018.753 I power walk like a grandma at a mall. 014025.556 --> 014027.797 It's 900am, the doors just opened! 014029.547 --> 014033.419 Got my insoles! 014036.729 --> 014048.981 It's a box set.

It's so pretty. 014411.848 --> 014417.224 So cute. 020057.866 --> 020107.455 It was a Gwar concert. 020415.398 --> 020419.917 What? On your buds? 020547.970 --> 020549.196 'Sup? 020814.279 --> 020818.163 What, the display you just saw, or this? 020823.299 --> 020826.606 I think you just won the lottery, friend. I toss him the book. 020832.047 --> 020839.186 I know. Luckily, one of our crew members is smart enough, and he deciphered the whole 020844.297 --> 020849.821 thing. In there you'll find everything you need to know about the coup that Avantika has been 020849.821 --> 020859.513 planning. Whispers about wanting to rule the sea. She has been worshipping an outer-worldly being 020859.513 --> 020903.748 called Uk'otoa, left over from the Betrayer Gods. 020904.697 --> 020910.101 I didn't attack; she attacked us first. 020925.074 --> 020932.782 You're going to trust the things that she says? You'll see a U burned into the deck of the ship. 020947.328 --> 020952.300 You have time to read that book right now? 021006.116 --> 021010.405 Hey, you came to me, though. Why? 021016.701 --> 021023.191 What do I get when I'm right? 021028.386 --> 021032.419 How about we strike a deal right now? Because when you go down there, you're going to 021046.797 --> 021052.588 see murdered crew mates and a U burned into the deck of that ship from where she was trying to 021052.588 --> 021056.195 summon Uk'otoa. 021056.613 --> 021059.315 17. 021109.638 --> 021114.331 So if you think you can trust anything that she says before you get into the details of 021118.105 --> 021123.751 that book, details that we've already deciphered, as we've been on the seas with her for quite some 021123.751 --> 021127.921 time, and the betrayal that we have seen. 021127.921 --> 021132.747 Thanks. That's not the first time I've heard that. 021218.760 --> 021225.441 Hey! I want a boat, and safe passage out if we're correct. 021235.407 --> 021243.220 Deal. 021245.867 --> 021249.743 There's a cipher in the front. 021821.300 --> 021822.111 Yeah, it's pretty good work, right? 021830.895 --> 021836.448 I told you, yeah. 021839.797 --> 021844.402 He's our Solon. 021905.057 --> 021910.009 Well, we're from Wildemount. Hired mercenaries from the Empire. I'm with a secret 022050.924 --> 022104.688 order of the monks from the Cobalt Soul, known as the Expositors. Avantika has been a person of 022104.688 --> 022110.999 interest that we've been wanting to investigate for some time, and I was sent to do that. So, 022110.999 --> 022118.465 unfortunately, our business has nothing to do with you fine folk here of Darktow. It only has to deal 022118.465 --> 022126.499 with Avantika. She's disrupted our shores enough. We decided to investigate. 022126.499 --> 022129.678 My allegiance is completely separate and isolated from any persons here. My allegiance is 022138.921 --> 022142.437 with the Cobalt Soul. 022142.437 --> 022150.433 22. 022207.575 --> 022211.846 My voice is shaking. I'm so nervous. 022214.070 --> 022215.584 Mixed lies or half-truths. 022232.632 --> 022237.926 Hmm. So you have your library card? 022241.635 --> 022254.316 I do and Jester does. 022624.403 --> 022625.919 Yeah. It takes me literally punching the shit out of Avantika though. 022632.405 --> 022640.366 Before she-- (double punch) 022656.632 --> 022659.826 (laughter) 022659.826 --> 022703.926 Go for the temple. 022706.618 --> 022708.066 Yeah, I have all of my ki points left. More or less. All but one. Yep. 022713.536 --> 022717.088 Mine, I'm assuming, which is 14. Hang on. Features and traits. 022723.942 --> 022726.475 Yeah, 14. 022730.659 --> 022745.576 They are unable to speak a deliberate lie for one minute and all charisma checks have advantage. 022802.326 --> 022805.855 You have 60 seconds, but I have more knuckles. 022819.197 --> 022829.117 Oh my god! 022916.031 --> 022935.239 Will do, good sir. 023254.211 --> 023256.426 Should we try to take them? 023456.017 --> 023458.193 Yeah, we know how to sail now. 023510.219 --> 023512.329 Yeah, let's go. 023532.132 --> 023539.508 Like investigation style? 023657.255 --> 023702.344 Ooh, you are turning me on right now. 023706.140 --> 023707.396 Yes! 023708.017 --> 023708.692 Yeah, check for traps first, okay? 023717.306 --> 023718.904 This just turned into a resource management game. 024052.505 --> 024053.990 I'm having an adrenaline crash now. 024216.664 --> 024218.528 Are those little zoomy magnifying glasses? 024221.541 --> 024223.841 The crew got them. That was Max. Thanks, producer Max! 024228.398 --> 024232.070 Bye, Frumpkin. 024636.466 --> 024641.884 I don't know if I rolled.

Any inventory canvas on board, things to make supplies? 025235.692 --> 025238.387 Chocolate dipped strawberries, champ-pag-nay. 025242.614 --> 025247.467 Yeah, it's been a while since just the three of us have been in a room together. 025316.154 --> 025324.671 What? You're jumping around so much. 025331.721 --> 025337.355 She's quite pleasant, actually. 025353.751 --> 025355.025 She might be better than both of us combined. 025357.782 --> 025404.541 Which part difficult? Losing his fuck buddy? It's not that difficult. 025412.518 --> 025420.755 Of course it's minimalizing, have you met me? Everything I do is minimalizing. 025435.080 --> 025437.993 Yeah. 025451.204 --> 025454.836 Yeah, what Caleb said. 025457.643 --> 025458.927 Yeah, how do you know? 025503.480 --> 025510.405 You want to take a guess? 025525.623 --> 025532.878 It's very romanticized, but on that note Caleb, do you think you could recreate that cipher 025547.155 --> 025551.174 that you made and have one on hand? 025551.237 --> 025553.713 I'd like a copy, if you don't mind. 025556.156 --> 025559.872 Got them right here, Nott. Just these-- No, that wasn't working? No? All right. Yeah, it's 025613.492 --> 025618.766 a little true, but not as intense as you think. 025618.766 --> 025620.875 Monks? 025622.697 --> 025624.811 Expositors? 025626.092 --> 025627.521 Yes. 025628.929 --> 025634.219 Kind of new to it all, to be honest. 025641.721 --> 025644.333 Speaking of time that it takes to travel, are we sure that Avantika was the only one who was 025708.480 --> 025712.698 interested in what Uk'otoa has to offer? 025712.698 --> 025719.490 I guess what I'm saying is, are we still going to be competing against others once the 025725.357 --> 025729.440 Plank King successfully deciphers that book? 025729.440 --> 025738.515 It does kind of sound like a wives' tale. 025744.409 --> 025750.974 Let's go talk about it with the others, I think. 025757.811 --> 025802.590 Mended over this way. 030136.993 --> 030140.041 The boat or the island? 030152.414 --> 030154.431 With our shit all fucked up? 030203.748 --> 030207.677 It's a cleric-- oh god! d4 just went flying! 030255.860 --> 030300.579 Is it an event each day?

Maybe that's a team discussion. 030604.329 --> 030608.869 There still begs the question of, is someone else going to come looking for this? Now 030639.214 --> 030640.564 that the Plank King-- 030640.564 --> 030642.448 We gave the book with the cipher over, so if anybody else wants it-- 030648.610 --> 030650.766 We did!
