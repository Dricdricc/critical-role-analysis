I love it when you're surprised by your own content. It's my favorite. (singing) The bears are back in town! He said he wants to tell us secrets or something. I like secrets. Yeah. Secrets make friends. For trade, what does that mean? Nine. Tell me something cool! I'm sorry, boo! It's not good, an 11. No sorry, ten. Fuck you, Genghis Khan! Eight. This is all the notes from what we learned about Siff Duthar. I think he is a being of fire and ice, so I bet he's immune to fire and ice. Natural one? Stunned. What can I do? I'm going to be like The fire and ice from the book and the lost sword and all that shit, remember? Yeah. Yes, Sentinel! Okay, I'm going to-- I'm good, right? I'm going to run up and pull out that holy water that I didn't use before. I'm going to parkour off of Yasha's shoulder and spike it right at his feet. Okay, I don't know if that's good, 16. Eight. Okay, I still have my opportunity attack? I mean my-- Sorry, my secondary attack. I did move up. I said I ran up next to Yasha and spiked it. I parkoured off her shoulders, spiked it. I want to do flurry of blows. 19 and 15 to hit. That is an additional six-- Sorry, 12 damage. Okay, that's fair. I bet he wants his sword back. Don't fuck me, Gil. Ow, five. Yeah, ghostslayer! That guy knew way too much about everything. Lost them? Yasha can, though. Wait! Maybe if we show it the sword, he'll chill out. Where's that corkscrew thing? That's better, 16? Wait, we have the book that we found in the research center. It says, "From ashes I shall rise again." I can't get a reaction from it, as it goes? Fuck. I'm going to run over to this bookcase and put my staff behind it to see if I can knock it over. Fuck! That keeps happening! Six. I guess so. Can I give her some assistance? Smoke grenade! That's awesome! Mushroom cloud, that was great. I've got a little bit of oil. I'll give you a little bit of a therapeutic temple rub while I'm at it. What is that? 600? 700? Are you counting, Ash? I've never seen so many people happy for a natural one. Bring the art out, too. They're like, "We didn't anticipate this." Rich people love fancy art. Yeah. While all of this is going on, Beau wants to be going through some of these books that were on the shelf that we knocked over. I'm going to do a tour of the urns and see if there's anything, jewelry or something, hidden in there. 21. Can I do a little flip through of it? Can I use a ki point to get advantage? I'll mark that down really quick. I'll take that 11 over that two. 13? They tried to burn it. I walk over to Caleb. Hey Caleb. Found this. Sure. I think it's got stuff for you in it. That's unfortunate, actually. Sure. Covered in oil and ash. You've got like, a section to take notes now. Necromancers. But a great sword. Took his legs, yeah. That's why he had no feetsies. He actually didn't have feet. He lost his legs. Hmm. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah! Give me a damn ring. Beau leans over Caleb's shoulder. What are you reading? Yeah, that's cool. Who's the publisher? Is that first print? First edition? I recognize a few of those symbols. You know, magic shit. The Gentleman just wanted us to kill shit, right? He wanted us to-- Did you find it? Did he want us to bring back something? Or just clear it out? I thought he said he wanted us to bring the expensive good shit, but we can keep whatever else. Maybe some of the art? They love old things! If we say it belonged to a dead person, they love it even more. We'll each take a ring. We'll each take one ring. Maybe we can give him that research notebook we found. You keep the spellbook, we give him the research notebook. We already know what was in it. I say we keep the sword. Do we have to go back out through the river to get out of here? Which means we're going to have to pass right back through The Gentleman's place. It's not like we're going to be able to lie. I wonder where it goes. What do we remember about the Crawling King? Do you know anything? Did you say you rolled a one? You rolled a one, another one! Well, I think this information about the teleportation-y circle situation could be useful leverage if he wants to try and take that sword off of your back. I say we keep this teleportation a secret, unless he tries to start bargaining for shit. Not unless he asks. That's what we're saying. How did you forget we got that? I have one, I think? We have mushrooms! Well it's eight cubic square feet. Yeah, it's magical! I still like Yasha's idea. Just slip it up your back robe. All right, let's go. They worship some weird shit. Who knows what dark corners of the world it goes to. We're going to start with just trying to give him the rings and the art, right? Rings, art, shit-- Keep everything else. LAURA and We could do a scout boat. Maybe one boat stays behind, the other scouts it out? Separate the party! TALIESIN and I'll check it out. It's our boat? Our boat scouts. I use my staff to help navigate, Jester-- TALIESIN and I light a torch. We're back to the fork. We're going down that other path, right? Can I get a little bit closer? I can poke. I'm going to take my staff and jab it behind there, see if there's anything. There's always shit behind waterfalls. I think we should. Can I help her push off? Will it go anywhere, though? This is the end of it. It's stuck in the chamber? Ugh. Gross, Molly. You know, people are going to start-- How easy is it to get back down here, though? He is very wet. Explain that joke. Explain it. The research journal? The research one? What was it written in? Caleb, if you're done with that book do you think I could hold on to it? Yeah, I'd love to. Thank you. (singing) More bad dreams! Crack into a Kraken. I do a few push ups to get warmed up. Yeah, some squats. It's true. You need more than one example. Got to find that average. Like a satyr. Like in those ancient Greek paintings. Oh, big tusks. Does he have a cool lip tattoo? Couldn't afford a root canal? My childhood damage-- Insight check! I hate it when that happens. 800? It's nine? It's 1,000? Children are assholes. I mean, it's how we see you. Yeah, I mean we're too distracted with our own personal damage. Then we bribe him with the information on the teleportation circle. Sure. Yeah. Oh shit. She did rowing yesterday. 24. Oh shit. So many undead blobs. Lot of undead blobs. The boss is still asleep, you said. All right. Let's go be blindfolded. That's pretty bad. By the scruff. Bacon. I want bacon. There's like ash all over the place now. Sorry about that. Found lots of skeletons along the way. TRAVIS and We also found a decent amount of fine art for you. Come on, Jester. There wasn't a lot left. Oh! There was this floor with this relief in it of these two faces, and Fjord put some coins in it. It opened up and he collapsed and fell in a pit. It was super fun. No, we stayed up all night trying to get back here. There's just no answer further. You knew going in here it was heavily looted and raided. We brought you several pieces-- (sigh) Caleb, we talked about this. All right, man. Been in the business longer than we have. I toss him the research notebook. Here's the precious research you were looking for. You're welcome. Yes. Fuck! Who, just me? Can he help me? Natural 20. Thank you! Yeah! Motherfucking liars! Come on. There's been one too many "seemingly"s. Will we get confirmation, word from you, that the deed has been done? I take the leftover bacon strips, and I shove them in my pocket. I give half of my bacon to Caleb. Here you go. That was awesome. We have those chains. We could-- We found a dead guy. In chains. Do you think that people are going to start being suspicious of us if we keep selling magical manacles? The same blacksmith? Let him know that Horris is out of town. Several dead people. Especially Molly and I. As we're walking, I lean over to Fjord, and I go Something's been bothering me. The Gentleman said that it was Ulog that arranged and leaked the information to the Xhorhasian assassins. What would be his motive for doing that, if he only really cared about getting his wife free? Or at least revenge for his wife. I hope so. Feels like a big task for one person. How would he have those connections? Yeah. We could enter in a contest and fight for the Harvest Festival, right? Yeah. Maybe there's prize money or something. I like fighting people for fun. Yeah, that's it. (singing) Hide your kids! Hide your wife! Hey! Where do we sign up for the Victory Pit? Tell me. You know! We had a long-ass night. With advantage? What am I doing, intimidation? 14. She is not a child. There's a rec center, community service-- Thanks, it's all you had to tell me. I liked her. Sell shit. Sign up for the Victory Pit. Pawn the rings that we have. Us not getting charged for murder was the reward. Wow, that's good to know! Wait is this with the shrooms? Wait, what night are you doing this? I'll join you. No, we bought those magic mushrooms. Well, I have mine. Then you bought some too, right? Wait, how much is that? Wait. When Beau hears that she goes-- Yasha! (shouting) Oh no, Yasha you always do this, no! (laughter) Bullshit! (shouting) Where do you go, Yasha? (shouting) This sucks. I'm going to say Don't fuck me Gil! Oh, okay. Just a wisdom saving throw? 17. I flip my blue cloak inside out to the brown side. I think it sucks. You can see really cool things. Molly, how long does this last? Fuck. This is it. This is the rest of our lives. I thought that this was the first night, and this was our celebratory night. I join Molly. In our hoods and our boring cloaks! Just a saving throw? 20. I've got such cottonmouth. Mmm. What happens if you have a childhood, but it's barely a childhood because it was supposed to be someone else's childhood, but it was you instead? Is that a childhood? Is that why I have cotton mouth? Ah goddamn it! Well, I saw this goatman and he told me just don't eat the yellow snow and you'd be okay. This is definitely not a safe substance. I still have half a dose. I think it would be real funny to plant it on somebody and get them busted later. Don't judge me. Blood flow, she's fine. She's pregnant. She's not dead! (whispering) Hide yo wives. I'll wake up in the morning, early after my drug hangover, and make my way, quietly. Quite a headache! Coffee, the bacon that I had in my pocket from yesterday. I head to the Cobalt Reserve. Sorry, the Cobalt Soul branch in Zadash. I'll see if I can find Dairon. Sup? Hey! Is Dairon in? Just find Dairon. Thank you. Just go find Dairon. Talk in private? Bye, Xenoth! Just want to let you know I'm in town and busy. Is that good or bad? I don't know. It's hard to read you. You don't think the two could be mutually exclusive? Or best of both worlds? Hey! No, that I'm back and I'm dedicated. I figured showing up would be good, you know? Do you have time? My kind of woman. Let's go. Obstacle course? I tell her about the Xhorhasian spies and the terrorist that we encountered. Does she seem like she knew that knowledge or not? They said they were looking for an artifact. Something that the wizards here had stolen? Something that they said furthered their bloodline and made sure that they furthered their population. I don't know. Do you know anything about it? Why else would they attack the tower if they weren't looking for something specific? I never said I show pity. I wanted to know what the hell this artifact was that they were after. Figured you here at the Cobalt Soul would know. We wouldn't have any records on some Xhorhasian artifact that apparently keeps them alive? All right. All right. Thank you, Dairon. What? This Bloodgarden in the northeast side? Well, I still have a lot of training, so come back alive, I guess. Sure! I go back and join the rest. Yeah, it's the Luck feat all over again! Focus past the distractions. Never. He's never going to tell us. You're like chipping away at it? Like an ice sculpture? Oktoberfest! It's Oktoberfest, you guys. Wait, do we come in the Ren Faire gear that we own? You do. I was with you when you bought them. (laughter) That's the other pair?
