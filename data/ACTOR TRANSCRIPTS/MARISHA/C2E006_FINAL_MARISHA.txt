On our app? Hang on, it's refreshing! You should've given us warning! Did you just-- Panlanann. I am Panlanann, the wood half-elf blood hunter! Dude, my abilities are balls, though. I have a five dex and a four wisdom. That's sad. Wait, you got dope stats! Look how fucking crap these are! You should try sleeping on the floor. It's actually really good support. Sure. Oh my god, you killed your whole family. Oh, okay. Never mind, keep going. I'm sorry. Where's home? Where is this place that you stole-- That's what he's been doing this whole time. Isn't that what you're doing to yourself on a daily basis? Have you tried any other bloodlines? I'll save that for another day. How'd you sleep, aside from the crappy bed? Yeah, I mean, it's not a bad gig. I guess we should greet the town. Yeah. Maybe we could just stand in the middle of town and go, "Bryce?" until they show up. Okay, I have a question about this Broad Barn thing. Is Broad Barn the name of an establishment, or is Broad Barn a very broad barn? It's a very big barn? What if it's a tavern? I don't know, I got confused in his delivery. All right, yeah. What does the town look like when we step out front? How bad is it? Was I in the butcher's? Because that would be some real horror-level shit. That's kind of awesome. Question answered. I'm sorry, I'm standing by Fjord. Question answered! While they were having that conversation, I'm hanging back with Fjord, if you're cool with that. Question If you were a crazy, ravenous, dog humanoid person thing, what would make you really hungry all of a sudden? I didn't phrase that question very well. Yeah. It seems like they're into meat? Kind of anything. Also, they're really hungry, more so now. I don't know. Why more so now? But what if they are still hungry? You know who else was really hungry out of fucking nowhere? Big angry toad man. Devil toad guy. I feel like I should get better names for all these things. I don't know. I mean, it might be a coincidence. Well, considering some of them were undead. There was that whole zombie gnoll thing. Yeah. How could you forget that? I legitimately didn't understand what you said. Are you okay? I was just striking conversation. Okay, let's go to the Barn Broad. I was going along with you. I turn to Jester, and I go, look inviting. Look heroic. Bryce, some of these gnolls were undead, or raised from the dead. Do you have any inkling as to why, or have you seen that problem around here before? (gasps) Bryce? TRAVIS and Sorry, a lot on my mind. Speaking of the aurochs, I asked you yesterday if you'd heard if any of the farmers had had their cattle hit? You heard that yet? It's fine. We'll ask on our way out. It's good. I know; I feel like I learned something. An insecticide generally refers to insects. And we're talking gnolls. You're going to have to use a lot. Is it a good pickle, though? Guys, let's go kill gnolls. Nom nom nom! Yeah, so good! No, you take it for her, please. What did you say, Molly? Well, the butcher got severely cleaned out. If we can try and figure out a way to set up our operation on the edge of the forest so that we're not in the middle of a field, in the open-- Hills are bad to fight in, unless you're on top of the hill. That's good. Go ahead. Actually, that's not a bad idea at all. Maybe we could have like a survivor round up team and a defense team? We can always go back out and get more ears whenever we damn feel like it. Let's go! TRAVIS and Oh good, I see you brought us your best, Reggie. Thanks, man. I saw them take off into the forest. I tracked a little bit right between those trees. I don't know, we can start there. I'll be on the lookout for cart tracks. It's not my strongest, but it's okay. 16. No wait! I rolled a natural 16, so 19! I thought it was a 13; I apologize. Wait, are there nearby towns? Are there other nearby villages? Oh, we only saw one. Okay, can I get like an odd estimate of maybe how many gnolls we might be dealing with based on the amount of tracks? I turn to the rest of the group and I go Good news, we're real stupid if we thought we couldn't track them, because there's a fuckton of them. That'll be easy. Bad news is, oh god, there's a fuckton of them. That's it. Or is it just open fucking hills? How rough and how open is our situation right now? Are we in the middle of an open field? Remember how I was like, this is the worst situation to be in? I feel like this might be the worst situation to be in. Survival? Perception? Oh no. Did you see that? One. God. What if I gave Jester a ride on my shoulders? While we walked. In the cart, and I'm holding you. It'd be kind of cool! Okay. Like a saving throw or just a check? That's okay. It's a 14. (strained) Yeah, you are! Oh god-- (grunts) Jester, I'm going to put you down. Yeah. I help Jester hide the cart. Seems a waste. We're not in any tree line or anything. Let's flank. Around. Do we need to have some sort of awesome whistle or something? To communicate with each other? Oh, what was that thing you did in the circus? That was cool. (whistling) Yeah, I imagine that the ends are going to be where you need the most strength, right? Great. 16. Do you think they're centurions? If they see us? I'll bet they're the alert system. But we have to kill them all at once. Yeah. You want to try and make a distraction and bring them closer? To us? Then we can jump out of the grass? Do the old "jump out of the grass--" Oh, buddy. (slamming) I'm going to take the blunt end of the staff and go right for it as it skids by, I'm going to take right in its neck. Ooh, not great. Ten. I didn't get my bonus attack on that guy. Can I get my bonus attack? Okay. I want to try and bring my heel down on top of it as it tries to scooch away. Fucking-- did you see that? Nine. Nine. You know, I had a long day yesterday, okay? Just was faster than I thought. Do you mean the hyenas? Oh, mining. I misunderstood that, too. I'll take the opposite side that he's doing. A ghillie net. That's what I was going to say, is it heavy? How big is this thing? Can we fold it up and stuff it in a bag? Oh, that's big. We can grab it on our way back and throw it on the cart. Canary in a gnoll mine! (laughter) We have to do it, it's too perfect. Sorry. That was going to be my question! And dies? That's right, yeah. Like a walkie talkie! I'll punch you in the face. What's going on? It's so dark! It fits in there! Oh, are there any close to me? Okay, I'll close the gap and come at it with a big double swing from my staff. Finally a decent roll. 19. Six plus four. That's ten points of damage. I shake it off my staff a little bit. It's effective. I'll look around. Are there any other entrances? That was me. Me and Caleb. Oh, sorry. For the bags, yeah. Oh, yes. Did you light it? Is it a lit lantern? Oh, I can close it on and off, right? Like one of those things? All right, guys, left tunnel or right tunnel? I kind of like her when she's like this. It's good. Yeah, little drafts, anything like that? This sucks. 22. Oh, that was well done. Fuck. I'm afraid if we keep waiting, more will just show up. Well, maybe we can draw a few over to us and take them out on our terms. If we can make some sort of distraction, to get their attention, and if we can put or heavy hitters, our people up front, we can try and hold them in this mouth, ranged people in the back. You see, more are going to keep coming. Normally, miners build coal mines with connecting shafts and double exits in case one side collapses. You always want another way out. We just don't know where they've put everybody. We're here looking for villagers, remember? Hey, Matt. DM question? If we were to try and back out of here, and draw them towards us, what would that be? Just a tunnel? Yeah, that's what I heard. It's only a death funnel if we're the ones dying, right? If they're dying, that's good for us. Surprise round, get as many range and AoE spells off as we can? Yeah, that's good. Let's all agree that if this goes bad, we run. Oh God. Can I get more into a place with Beau? In this crux, mirroring Nott. Stealth check? Natural 20! Three-point landing. I (gagging). Nope. Okay, I'm going to do something weird, and I hope it works and doesn't fuck the rest of us. I'll move up right here next to Fjord. 40. That works good there. Let me go one more. That's good. Then can I reach in my bag and grab out, in my little pouch, grab out a handful out of my 1,000 ball bearings? A lot of ball bearings! Can I take it and-- you know how you can take your pocket and flip it inside out? And have a bunch of ball bearings go (metallic clinking) across this way? Is that my action? Okay, I'm going to spend a ki point, and as my bonus action take Patient Defense. I'm shaking. God, that's bad. I don't think I even fucking spelled it right. I think I botched that all across the board. I spelled it "Hyneas." Miss. Oh, hit. With disadvantage? Hit. 17 is my armor class. This is with a bow? I'm going to cat-paw try to catch the missile with Deflect Missiles. What do I spend-- Oh, wait. Oh no, wait, this is a ki point. Oh no, it's a ki point to throw it back, it's just a reaction. It's 1d10 plus seven. Nine plus seven, so 16. I hold it out like a microphone and go-- I laugh at it, as it comes at me. Miss. I haven't, but we rolled at the same time. Yes! I'm going to take my staff, I'm going to try and crack this guy on the back of his head where he is. Jesus Christ al-fucking-mighty. 13? Does that hit? I'm my own worst enemy! I'm going to do a knee and a round kick-- Oh no, sorry. I can just do one. I'm thinking in advance. One kick with the knee! I wipe my hand on Fjord really quick. Whoa, it was effective! Yeah! Nose punch. No! Aw, damn it! Right, okay. How far away is he? I'm having a hard time seeing. Can I close the gap? Okay, can I do some cool monk shit and do some wall running and leap and parkour and then get to this guy? Acrobatics? Parkour! Oh, that's good! That's a natural 18 plus six. Miss! My foot just taps his arm just a little bit and I leap off of his arm. As I'm leaping, I want to take the staff and come down and go (crack) with a slap. Double handed, piece of shit gnoll! Oh god, it's a two! That was my eight-sided die. I'm trying to efficient my rolls. I scream as I come down the whole way going (screaming). I just go (pop) and do a little jab, okay. That's an 18. That's just a d4. Four, so eight! Get a good hit, lollipop! Sounds great. Fuck yeah, that was awesome. Bad physics? I turn behind me, I go Watch the ball bearings! Watch the marbles! Shit. I want to do this as my two-handed attack, but for flavor to skin it. I want to stroll up, channeling The Rock. Charge up the elbow. Then we go a People's Elbow. Come right down. Just a full body weight (thudding). With advantage? Can I consider it a two-handed attack? Oh my god! Why?! (yelling in pain) For flavor, my second attack isn't really an attack. I'm in so much pain I go (yell) and I kick a little bit. Natural 20! Every time I try to show off it never works. That's what I'm learning. Okay, three doubled to six plus four. So ten. I don't care too much. I just roll over and go fetal for a minute. Come on, Nott. Bring it home! It's almost something like a Jacob's Ladder moment, the end of his life is being stretched out. Can I, since I'm in that general vicinity, go 20 or so feet into this hole and listen and see if I hear anything? 13. I bend down-- I turn around and come back to the rest of the group and say There's something bigger. I think there's something bigger at play here. Whatever is driving these gnolls I think is deeper in. Can I look around and see if I can find anything like any papers, anything from that humanoid that might be intelligible? Okay, 20 total. Can I try and figure out what this is, if I recognize this symbol in any way? Yeenogru? Yeenoghu? Yeenoghu or what? MATT and Jewelry, wedding bands, anything? While he does that, can we, no we can't take a short rest. It's not enough time. Nope. Ignore what I said. There's something real big back there. It's real big. She's got a badass scythe. I saw nothing that would clue me in as to what might be deeper and really big? Okay. Let's go. While we wait for those three minutes I turn to Molly and I say, Do you remember anything in your recollections of this Yee...ah...noghu. LAURA and Uh-huh. Yoplait is a female deity? Or a male deity? Do you remember? I'm wondering with that whole, you know-- Well, the guy. The guy running the ceremony said that the hunger will be fed, "ours "and hers," right? I mean, that's what he said, right, DM? I didn't mishear that? I just wonder who "hers" is. Who is that? Yeah. What? No! Oh my God! We didn't know about this. We knew this. We totally fucking knew this. He's so nice. He's such a teddy bear.
