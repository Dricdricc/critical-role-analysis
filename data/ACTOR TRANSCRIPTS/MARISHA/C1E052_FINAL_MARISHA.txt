--purveyors for like three years. Yes, a drinking horn! This one's got a maze on the inside. Yeah, they're good storage boxes. Or regifting boxes. $3 off. It's going to be weird. We're going even weirder. So for everyone who already hates how weird it is, buckle up. Wait, all of us? You're still ahead of me. You rolled a nat 20? 13. Fucking Wheaton! That's a short rest. Do it, do it. He's paralyzed. Yeah, yeah. You rolled four, though. Okay. I'm going to roll up this roof like a big, ominous fog cloud. And come up, and I want to do a Whirlwind on those two archers up there. Yup. So they must make a DC 13 strength saving throw. The thing that she loved killed her. 13. Strength. Okay, so the one that fails takes 3d8 plus two bludgeoning damage, which is pretty good. 11, and he's flung 20 feet away. In a random direction. Yeah. He takes another 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every ten feet he was thrown. And he's knocked prone. And the other guy-- Takes half damage. Yup. We talked for a week! Don't die, you are not dying tonight. She's not going to die, she's not going to die. There's only one guy who ran up to her. Yay! That rogue damage. That rogue damage! I've got a Marilyn Monroe thing going on in my air elemental, oh. What a dick! That's a natural 18, so that's a 26. I rolled double ones. Plus five, so seven. Little damage. What? Who's that? Flaming spikes! Hah, 'I thought you were going to come out with a f-- that, that, yeah, that works, that.' But then advantage because it's reckless? Can you hit Greenbeard? All right. Tornado's coming down the house. I'm going to hit these two guys with a Whirlwind again. Yep. 13 strength save. So nine plus-- oh, one more d8. Plus another five, so that was 12 plus five is 17, plus another two, so 19 halved. I'm staying in their space, by the way. Good times, guys. Six attacks. Get that barbarian's resistance. Well. I mean, he doesn't have an arm, he doesn't have the arm. That was-- he can't get that back. I know, how does that work if you only have half your-- MVP this fight! Into the fire? What? It's okay, we're not live. It was going pretty well. How did he fucking scale that fast? No one wants to fuck with the elemental? Really? No one? Yes! Wow. Rolling terribly. Ten total. Oh no, oh, I had to roll to hit. I'm sorry, I was rolling damage. I didn't roll to hit. To hit, that is, plus, 16 to hit? No one's around him. He, yeah. He teabags it. That's probably what he's going over there for. I'm fine, I haven't taken any damage. No, I'm up 90 bonus hit points and I haven't taken any damage. Gah, fucking fucker. They all made their saves. Good job, guy. Yeah. On it. Natural 19. Whoops. No, I knew it, I knew it, it's going to heal him for all of his hit points. Heal is a 7th-level spell. God dammit, I was about to handle that. I was about to handle that! Who's bringing him the gauntlet? Who is? Fucking druids! Fucking druids! We've got to get those fucking gauntlets. Where's the gauntlet, can we see the gauntlet on the battlefield? He just made his constitution save. Wait. Did you roll that? I know, we're breaking under pressure. Okay, angry at the fact that I'm not doing much, I'm going to slowly, for flavor, my air elemental's going to start burning a little fire, I'm going to drop my air elemental and I'm going to do Firestorm. I revert back. Aw, I've been demoted. This is alternate timeline version. I drop form and I'm going to Firestorm all up in this bitch. Seventh level, so it's ten ten-square-feet. So let's do like-- Ten ten-foot cubes. I could've gone around them. So let's start, can I do ten including this archer, ten? Actually, as part of the spell I can choose to not set the tree on fire. So I choose to spare the tree. All plant life is spared. I am not a vegan. From there-- is that a guy, who's that, who's that? Another one there. That's fine, and then that one. Bam. And then let's go. Can I go four, and then-- And that got all of these guys? And then can I go eight, nine, get this guy-- And get all of 'em? Okay. Zorro! Okay, ten-- Sorro! Sorry. 10d10. Or no, sorry, sorry. 7d10. Wait. Let me double-check. Let me double-check what it is. 7d10. Okay. 7d10. Uh-huh, which my spell DC is 19. Eight. Some of those are good. Plus six, so that's 14, 16, 18, 19. Another nine, around another-- 29. 29 total points of fire damage. I light Vax's fire in the meantime. No it does not, I'm going to use a bonus action to do Grasping Vine. I could do a bonus action to heal somebody. Who's down really bad, can I see Pike? Are you rough? Have you taken some damage? Can I see Vex flying off into the distance? Not great, 14. I see, I can't hurt him anymore, I see Scanlan, that's all I can really see? That's it, that's my turn. Your tiny feet. Fuck! Is the arm still in it? Wow. Just focus on the mission. Shifty kid, c'mon. It worked! Squish. So going to loot that shit. Is it like a chair? Nice! Can I assist him with a skywrite 'Strongjaw'? I mean a stormcloud above him? Yeah, yes, can't roll above a five next week. Yeah, we didn't kill that many. I go and check the little boy. How bad is he? Is he beyond the point of return? I'll assist Pike in any way that I can. No, I said I wanted to help. What? How am I aiding with the ritual? What were you doing? I also speak-- no, I speak Primordial. I keep getting that confused. Can place my hand on his chest and place my other hand on the ground and try and use natural healing to assist? Natural one. It's okay. I dump a Cure Wounds in him now. Not a potion! I cast Cure Wounds. He heals 24 hit points. I give him a boost. We've got a child to deliver home. That is an interesting point. Now we're going to have to have another huge conversation. But we had them on the run! What was that? That was a three-hour battle. We did nothing but fight. I know, it's like a little present to yourself that you forgot you got. Thank you, Dwarven Forge!
