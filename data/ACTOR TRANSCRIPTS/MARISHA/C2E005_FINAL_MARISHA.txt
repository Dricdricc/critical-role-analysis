Squall Squatlock. Mollysquawk the J-pop Hadockhop. Madame Mannequin Ba-Deece. Yay, golf rules! Yeah, it happened... last night? Wednesday night, it happens after Wednesday Club. It's being GMed by Amy Dallen and it's an interactive storytelling RPG game. It's got all the ladies of Geek & Sundry, so check it out. Thanks, man. Thanks. I wouldn't say I won, because I lost. But I did pretty good. What color is it right now? Is it in that orange-ish purple-- Right. Got that little orangey. Mm-hmm. Thanks. Oh no, that was just a little bar fight. Nothing. Just a little friendly sparring. Nothing crazy. That would be really cool. Do they look like they're traders? Like traders, not traitors. 17. Yes, agreed. Does it look like they have any wares that they're traveling to trade? That's a 16, I think. Yeah. 19. Yeah, do they look sad? Would you join in in the stand off? Would you join the stagecoach robbery? The things with moving carts of that big a family is they tend to prep. You don't know what kind of people or weapons they have with them. You know how we're pretty sure that everyone on this road's going to kill us? Yeah, everyone else thinks that, too. Yeah, I'll take watch. It's just general perception? Not too bad. 18. Oh. Take that back. Take it back. Is there a tree that looks climbable that I could get a vantage point? Oh. Sure. Anyone want to take a quick pee break? All right. Let's go over to the bushes. Can we take it with us fairly easily? Just off the road but we don't have to go all the way to the tree, I can-- I'm just going to go check out this tree over here. See if I can get a little better vantage. Yeah, kind of forgot about that. Both are very pleasant, but I do not necessarily need that to feel fulfilled. Just people coming. I wanted to wait for Caleb. It's a damn good tree. I do miss climbing trees. Okay. Feels like childhood. Do you want up here? All right, I lift her up. Is there anything carved in the branches, in the tree trunk? 18. Really? What do you think lives in that hole? Have you ever seen an unicorn? Pocket unicorns? Where do you find such things? What is it like being in your head? Does it look like there's any trees or any base of mountains or any place that would be a good sheltered campsite? I have an adventurer's kit. Does that have a tinder in it? Sure. I'm a little-- you be my eyes. It's super dark. You know what, I'll start digging a little pit. Oh, nice. Little hamster tails! Oh man! I'm what? Did you say I'm fucking irritable? What do I see? You sure they were just cows? Or donkeys? Or buffalo-type things? 11. Can we tell what they are? Now that we're closer? Six. Yeah. That was fun, let's go. It's your turn now! Just don't get a lich phylactery installed in you again. Does it taste like stomach acid? Because that's gross, man. You taste like a seaman. (laughter) You never told me where you got that sword. I mean, because I saw it get a little soggy, a little drippy, when we were fighting the frog thing, so, you know. It's a pickled sword? Are there benefits to pickling your weapons? Oh, right. Yeah. It is very salty. Okay, there are some pun competitions that get serious. What happened on the trip? Rough waters? I might be able help you with that. I was obsessed with underwater life and mermaids, so I've read a few books. Has that happened to you before, by the way? The whole, "waking up coughing salt water" thing? Well, excited to see what unfolds. Shall we? I feel like the snooty town that I came from would have a Winter's Crest festival, like how we have Oktoberfests out here. Even though we have no real business having them, yeah. Do some pull-ups on the tree branches. Just a little bit. I don't mind. Do we have the highest perception? Fuck. I almost got-- samesies. 11. Deal. I'm going to scan still while I'm-- With my shitty vision. I'm riding. I'm just like What's wrong? LIAM, SAM, and Think we just watched someone commit arson, you guys! Let's go kick their ass. Can I do a quick scan and see if I see more? Don't fuck this up. That's okay, 17. We'll go after the one that stole the guy. 30 gold a gnoll ear? Nott and Jester, do you guys have ways to block arrows? Let's go towards the wall. Did you leave it outside? No, it's just on the table. I'll be with Jester. Natural 19. 25. I'm also going to use my speed to dash across. I can move 40. Can I peek into this window and see if I can see anything in here? Stealthily? Oh shit. Okay. I turn to Nott. I go-- The gnolls! Shh. Natural 20. That's the second one of the night. No good? Oh no. 24. I turn to Nott. Hey, you want to take these guys? You ready for this? Get ready. I want them to come to this window, okay? I'm going to go (whistles) through the window. Try and get their attention. To whistle? Not great. Not great at all. Three. Is that my action or a bonus action? Bonus action. Shit. Going in! I jump through the window, and before one of them leaves, I'm going to crack them with the staff right over the head. Can I go in through the window? I thought it was much closer than that. Oh! They're going out the back door. I thought they were going out that way! Okay. That's bad disadvantage. Fog of war. Okay, I'm going to double ba-- Ah, I can't move anymore, can I? I'm going to spend a ki point and do Patient Defense. Oh, really? Ooh. Great, I'll do that. I'll just hold back and wait. I thought I was going to still be a lot closer to Nott. And they all have disadvantage. Because I did Patient Defense? Miss. I immediately go whoops. 17 is my armor class. Okay. I'm going to use Deflect Missiles for my reaction. (grunting exertions) But it's not super-- I'm still level three, so it's more like a cat swat. That is seven on the dice, plus seven, 14. Yeah, let's do it! Just because I can! I'm going to do it at the guy in front of me, who's right behind me. So I'm going to catch it, and I'm going to spin around in a full flourish, and I'm going to just throw it like a Gambit card with the momentum that it's got. What's the attack roll? What is it? I've never done this before! It's brand new! Okay, 16. Four. Four damage total. You make the attack with proficiency and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack. So six total. I go Hah! Ooh. Miss. And I go no, seriously dude, did you see that?! That's fair. Miss. I just go, excuse me for a second. Thank you. We're all trying some shit, it's okay. He's the runt. I do a little duck. 17 hits. I'm doing the animal control thing and be like No, no, bad. My go, okay. Let me put these hit points in. Apply changes. Okay, I'm going to do something creative. I'm going to take the arrow that Nott just fired into the guy's chest. I'm going to grab it. Can I rip it out with my off-hand, spin around, and stab him back in the blade? God blessed fuck. That's not good. That's a ten. Okay, I'm going to take my other off-hand attack on the one that just bit down on me. I'm going to rip from it and elbow crack it right in the nose. Damn it. That's 11. Shit, that was my bonus action, wasn't it? I can't use a ki point, can I? I was wanting to do a ki point to do Patient Defense again. Yeah, can I back up into the house and close the door? Sure! No, I'll stay. Miss. My stick! Mine! Drop it! Bad! Do you want to play or not? You have so many fun gadgets! Bad dog. How much? That one hits. Three? Two? You did a good thing here. You did good today. You just got the participation trophy. Take out a wheel! I think that hits, right? Oh, poopers! Miss. Oh god, okay. I'm going to taste a little bit of blood that's now in my mouth, get real fucking pissed off, and I'm going to do a Star Wars-style flourish and go crack down to the new guy. Which one looks like he has less damage? Let's do the skeletal guy. Not good at all. 14. Okay. Eight points of damage. I'm going to use my bonus action. With that momentum, I'm going to stick the staff in the ground, and use that to lift myself up and do a two-footer kick into the other guy. Let's do Flurry of Blows. Nope, this is my second. I did, but I did it as an action, not on a bonus action, and you said I didn't have to use a ki point. I did Patient Defense, I did one Flurry of Blows-- I spent one doing deflect, and then one to do Flurry of Blows. No. This is the second one. This is the first Flurry of Blows I'm doing. Shit, I don't remember. This was what I rolled, right? Okay, not good. Ten. The other is okay. 15. Seven. Now I'm going to look around, and I'm going to step back and into the house for just a minute. This is fine. Just so I have cover. Right in the doorway. Quick timeout. You hear a (faint scream) in the distance. How do we feel about the cart? Do we chase after him? You're welcome, boo. No bad Halle Berry lines. MARISHA and Okay, I step out of the burning building, sauntering like a badass John Woo film. Yeah, and looking at this one, I go Hey, your friends have an inside joke without you. Pointing at the guy on the ground. As soon as he turns, I go whack like a baseball bat, right across his head. Oh, that's good. 25! No, sorry, 24! I'm going to take that, that's a 13, sorry, ten, nope, 11! Math. I'm going to, using that momentum, do a helicopter flourish above and go crack down over top. That's a natural 19! Oh, wait, this is technically an off-handed. Ooh, that's a four, so eight points of damage. Fuck. I'll hold. No. This here. I have advantage on that? Fuck. Oh, but that's still good. 18. Is that with my regular attack? Eight damage. Yeah, who was allowed to run? Dope. He's going to turn into powder. Hearing you say that, I'm going to be like, I guess we're-- race you! I'm going to take off running after Nott. 40 feet speed. I do. That would just get me-- I'll save it for right now. But I can see Nott, and I can see the guy, and I can see the cart. That was a double move? All right. Ten? Are you down? I grab Fjord and I say, just wait. Wait. Let them go. I want to watch them as far as I can to try and pinpoint a direction that they're heading in. Not great, 11. Ah shit, the town, you guys! And I'm going to go back and start trying to put out the fires. We're like Oh no, put out this fire! I totally remember kicking this guy's ass. Watchmaster? Has there been something else going on, that you can think of, that might have cut off their food supply? Bladegarden? Especially if they're as desperate as you say they are. Have you heard local farmers complaining about them stealing livestock? Missing livestock? Oh, W.C. It's a good name. Dope. I'm fine with that. In the meantime, you wouldn't have anything that might help us and our little expedition, would you? Healing potion might be nice if you got one hiding away somewhere in a closet, forgotten. Fair. We all have an extra 60 gold, yeah? Oh, there it is, I found it. SAM and
