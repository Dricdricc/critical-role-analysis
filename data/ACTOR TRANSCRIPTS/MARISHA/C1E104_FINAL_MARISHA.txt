Oh my gosh, guys! Episodes 11 through 21? 21. 20? Yeah. 11 to 20 are out, right now. The other next batch of 10 should be out in a couple of weeks or so. But you can find that on iTunes and Google Play. (gasps) Brian Foster! PDT (laugh) Oh yeah, Mischa! You guys can send in Chris to adjust it. It's okay! They know we're a show with a sound guy. There's no real illusion. Sound guy Chris! Vasselheim's most wanted? No, I wanted two cheeseburgers. What did you say? Do we need a short rest? It's in the Bag of Holding, right? It would be good for microdermabrasion! I walk over to Pike and put my feet in the water with her, stand on the edge. Well, you had such good observation skills with the whole ever-present light thing. Man. You're always a surprise. And after so many years. I look at Pike. I say, Pike, this place is beautiful. It's incredible, and I don't think we would be here if it wasn't for you and your connection to Sarenrae. And I'm honored to be here with all of you all. And to see this place with Vax. This makes me happy. Just this moment. This is nice. (sighs) I love you all. And I use my inspiring leader feat. (laughter) I'm so proud. He's as cold as his skin is right now. I was about to say, I don't leave Vax's side. Didn't we go through something like this before? So is it like a side-scrolling background? Is the terrain repeating itself? What was your theory? I start walking the opposite direction. Away from the tower, with my eyes open. I turn around. Is the tower any closer? Is it further? Shit. I walk back. I walked the other way, and it definitely didn't work. What do we do? They're believers. Do I have to believe deeper than that? But Percy, you don't believe in anything. This is bullshit! Yeah. Yeah. But that comes from Pike, not from Sarenrae. Okay. I try really hard. Think about the marshmallowy goodness that is Sarenrae. Okay. We have to walk, though, right? I'm still thinking about marshmallows, though. He is something of a demigod now, you could say, and well on his path to ascension. He wants to be like you. Or I guess he wants to be like the Raven Queen. He could tell you more, but I know she was a mortal who rose to her godhood, and I know he's looking for a similar path. We've seen it. He's slowly staked out on the Prime Material plane. Just north of Vasselheim, about 350 miles. What does that mean? How can we stop him? How long do these seeding rituals usually take? How much time do we have? I'm so confused. That's it? We didn't walk away from him unscathed the first time, and we're just supposed to try again? Is Sarenrae gone? What are titties? What do titties? (laughs) That you've been trying to crush? Is he as warm and welcoming and nice as you are? Okay, that's a good answer. Is there the same ever-light sky? Ever-present, sorry. Ever-presence in light. I use my druidic die. 29. Sorry, 31. Sure. Oh. Hey, guys, Pelor's not messing around. You know, I feel a little bit more connected here. This I can-- it's trees. I'm surrounded by trees. This I can relate to. I've talked to the Sun Tree. (gasps) I wonder if the Sun Tree is here? Maybe he's got a twin here like you have a twin! Decent for a city boy. Souls also don't wash up on beaches, but apparently they do. At least he knows the dangers of monocultures. This is very impressive. (gasps) Grog! Don't say that. He'll do it! You know that's what happens! Yes, I'm a soul. Blue, like your feather. I have a feeling it's an offering. Are we getting closer? Percy, how do you feel about gods these days? Last time we talked we were both not optimistic, I feel like. Reverence. But a lot of things can squish us like bugs. I don't know, this is complicated. Let's just keep going. I'm going to keep an eye out while we're walking, for anything that resembles the Sun Tree. I wonder if we believe harder if we'll get there quicker. See, this tree can squash me like a bug. If it fell on me, yeah. Does this feel like sunlight? Does it register like sunlight or is it a whiter light? Yeah? Is it sunlight temperature? He does have a twin. How close are we to the column of light? I Druidcraft a little twig and hold it into the light column. Nothing? I'm going to touch it. Okay, we're not going to die. No. Maybe the light will take us there, straight to him. I jump in. I touch a few as I walk by. See if I feel anything. Should I? LAURA and I don't know. Maybe he's like a distant relative of the Sun Tree. Maybe I know him by proxy. I'll try and speak to one of the Sun Trees that looks the most friendly. That's a natural one. I don't know. Amiable? Amicable, amiable. All right, I'll talk to a tree. That's what I'm going to do. Hey, Sun Tree bro. Are you a Sun Tree bro? Are you a Sun Tree brother? What's your name? No, I didn't know if you knew the Sun Tree that grew in Whitestone on the Prime Material Plane. I didn't know if you knew him. Can you tell me a little about this plane? How do we talk to Pelor? How do we see him? Okay. Yeah. Wow. I have a friend who wants to know about the fruit. He's wondering if the fruit is souls? If he can eat the fruit. No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. Would you like a hug? Okay. Well, it was wonderful meeting you. Absolutely. Thank you. All right, bye. Okay, bye. You were waiting the whole time to use that, weren't you? The whole conversation. Yeah, it was fine. Just can't talk to everybody, I guess. It's fine. Nothing. Just asked if he knew the Sun Tree, and he got super offended. You know what? Let's just go. No, I have never been rejected by a tree. Most trees like me. People don't like me, but at least trees do, except for this asshole. My leaves are prickly. That's nice, Vex. Thanks. You didn't talk to this guy, okay? You don't know. Yeah, he said it's fruit. It's fine. You can eat it, too. You're right, Grog. You were right! Eat the fruit! Let's go! Come on. I rip off an apple as I go, and I start aggressively eating it. I fucking spike an apple that I had earlier! No! I just want to go in the tower. Are they devas? Celestials? Angels! Fruit. Wait, really? Maybe you would have gotten smarter. Maybe it's super fruit. Maybe it's acai berries. I beg to differ. Go to the courtyard. Club's over here, guys. This must be the bright light that everyone sees when they die. You guys, he knows our name. We are here to prevent the coming of a third Calamity. He seeks ascension into godhood. We don't know how to destroy Vecna. And assistance. It's not the only one in existence. There are others. Right? What if we can-- We know you and her helped seal away the chaos of these secrets before. We may need your help doing it again. I could be your champion. You could teach me to believe. I, arguably, am faithless. I know you all know that. I believe, and I have respect, and I am awe-inspired by all of this. But faith, I still don't know if I have, but I... I believe you could teach me. What? We already have one champion of the Raven Queen. Why not? I'm friends with the Sun Tree. We talk occasionally. You are the lady of Whitestone. It suits you. I. Hate. Timed. Challenges. Are people clustered up together by now? Are people super clustered, or is she now clustered with them? So the angel dudes are all clustered together? Throw up a big level five Flaming Sphere. Ah, wait can I do a, with my spear can I do a higher-level Fireball? And just do more charges out of it? Or no? Then I will do a 5th-level Flaming Sphere. It doesn't hit both of them? I told you that I was faithless, which might be true when it comes to the gods, but not with Vex'ahlia, not with Vox Machina. She gives me my power. Wow! You're a walking nuke! Also a natural 20. Pools of Wittebak? Just don't let it fall in the toilet when you go over to flush. Champions over here. Is every episode going to be this emotional for the rest of the game? I can't keep doing this. We're god hunting without you guys. It's weird. And check out the podcast!
