I just have the one. That's good, because you can keep adding paper to it. I don't write too big. I don't have only four words on this. Monday! Between the Sheets! That was on Monday! That show is a one-on-one deep dive with Brian W. Foster, where he talks about how storytellers became storytellers, and he's starting with Taliesin, and he teaches you how to make a cocktail. Oh god! (laughter) What if I morphed, though? You weren't supposed to know! 21st. Crash Pandas, of course, done by the same guy, Grant Howitt, who did Honey Heist. You can download all of his games for free. Search his Patreon and support him, because he makes free games for people. That's a nice thing to do with your life. Turtle person? Yeah. Pretty cool-looking. I don't think I've ever actually saw one, either. I've only seen pictures. Are those tattoos? Should we talk to him first? We order anything other than milk please. Entertained. Yeah. Orly? Orly Skid-- And I'm Beau. Just go on a little walkabout. Crotchety half-elf bartender And the other fisherman person? It's so dapper in here! (whispering) --that badass, hot captain. And now she's older! She's got the salt and pepper hair! (laughter) Wasn't she the one that I asked if she was a pirate, right? She was like, "The fuck?" Capnis or Cadmus? MATT, LIAM, and It does sound familiar. He's a pirate. Fucking pirates! That also sounds familiar. Was this recently? When would I have written-- Where did those flash pots come from? Oh my god, I know. Hi! I feel like we should talk. Let's get this back corner booth. Also, we've never seen the ocean. Are you okay? I'll buy. It's been a while. Yeah. I'm not going to pay for a nice glass of wine for your ass. I was talking to Caleb. I'd buy a glass of wine for you. Yeah. Technically only has one spot on her boat. So you're on a journey of immediate agency, and you're not sure where you're going, and you think you have to go, but you're not sure? We have to go punk some guy's ass who's been harassing her. If you want to join us on kicking this guy's ass, and then we can report back to her. Someone's head? Is it a body? It's a body, isn't it? We have so many questions. His name's Algar? Algar Dyomin? Have you heard of him? But he has a douchebag sounding name, right? Sisterhood of the Traveling Dodecahedron. Seriously though, are you okay after everything? We didn't really leave on the most positive of terms. Well, we're not replacing Molly. You should try some of his dead tea. It's pretty good. I don't have any dreams at night, you guys. Is that worrisome? Is that the deal? I don't think that's true. Oh, dream journals I think are true. Okay. Yeah, deal. I mean, by all reality, we barely know each other. Oh, sorry. Nugget. What if we teach Nugget to also be able to bamf to Yasha while she's gone? It has been a long time, Yasha. Then maybe Nugget can go back and forth between us when we're away. But how cool would that be? I yell over, Oh now you're interested in the tower! Stay on task, Widogast! Just quoting your own advice. (shouting) Can I get another wine? Yeah. The fuck, what's wrong with you? (shouting) That was my shoe, asshole! You just established that I was next to you. How do we find Algar? We asked about the Sluice. We asked Orly about the Sluice, and he said he didn't know. I mean, they already know we're all here. Maybe add his last name, Dyomin? Well, do we want to go by the Sluice Weave? Or is that going to be way too shifty? Yeah, but there are gates. So how do we get invited? See what kind of paperwork? Or identification? But I mean do we swim? Yasha and I want to kick douchebag ass together. It's been so long. I mean you can't live at the Sluice, right? He's got to leave it at some point, right? Nott, why don't we just pull you along since you have your water-walking ring? It would be like skiing. Then you'd ride in the boat. Yeah. Yeah, pretty good. Okay, okay, okay. (sighs) All right. So, my story, just so, you know, I can really commit to this. I'm a tourist. I'm still Beau, right? I'm Beauregard the tourist. Should I not use my real name? I'm Julia! From-- I am Leslie. Tracy? Tracy. Okay. I look like a Tracy-- okay. So I'm Tracy, from Zadash! (Valley girl voice) And, you know, my parents are paying for just a little bit of a spring break so that I can, like, go find myself before I go into college, right? Before I go to uni. Is this a thing? (normal voice) I'm trying to figure it out. Because if I'm just me, I'm just going to be an asshole. So I have to be somebody else. So-- and I heard about this mysterious Sluice entrance. This Sluice thing like-- You want me to do this, yeah? So I should take my hair-- Well, here. I'll just use this side, right? Is that good? Does that work? Yeah. Do I find the most insecure-looking guy and then use that? All right, I go to the most insecure-looking guy. Jeez, I need to not use Gil's die ever. 14. It's okay! (Valley girl voice) Oh gosh, isn't the water just so beautiful? Man, it's-- It's hot out here, just so moist. This air, right? (laughter) Oh great, because I could totally use some help. Well, you see, I'm from out of town-- I'm Tracy, by the way. What's your name? Merpol, hi. It's just, you know, I'm here and I'm trying to get the true Nicodranas experience while I'm in town and, you know, I just, I've heard rumors from people, you know, about this thing called the Sluice Weave. And you know, I would just love to see it, see if it's real, you know? 14. I'm too dumb to be a risk, right? Too vapid to be a hazard. I'm into curiosities. I'm a curious person. Wow! I hear they're haunted. Are they haunted? Oh, you gave me a little smirk. They're totally haunted! (laughter) I give him a little (giggle). I bet you're first in line to protect the city against an attack, aren't you? Wow! So interesting. So, have you been down there? Oh, so there's one inside the city? Oh wow. I heard there was one in the ocean! I turn to Fjord and I go (gagging sound). Sounds like it's got a lot of suction in the intake. Perception? Is that what you said? Okay. 15. Wow, yeah. Cool. Wow! Yeah, you know, I'm just so busy. You know, just trying to fill my schedule with things. I should probably go now. (forced giggling) I'm staying at the Lavish Chateau! I know. You probably couldn't afford it, so-- Sure, that sounds great! (forced giggling) You know. I'm actually doing a quick little boat tour, just right over there. But I'll be right back, okay byeee! (laughter) Just over there. I'll be right back! Just-- (giggle) Tracy! What was your name? Oh wait, your name is Marisol-- Porpal? Marpol? Merpol! Merpol? (heavy breathing) That was-- I need a shower. I don't know, I think it was something deep down inside me that I actually really hate. That it's there. It's maybe always been there. And then I had to-- (deep breath) Let's go. I don't want to talk about that anymore. Who the fuck is Tracy? It's come true! And that's not weird? Fuck you, man. It's over there. Poor Frumpkin. 60 feet. Oh, you have Knock. That's right. Fuck yes. That's true, if you can't speak, actually. (gurgling) I'll hold a rope. Me. That is the coolest! Oh! What?! Okay, here's my other question, though can we hold our breath that long? Yeah, I'm all right, too. That's cool. So you guys are going to go down and come back up again, and then we'll all go? Hopefully the rope can go this far? How long is this rope? Tie it up to the mouth of the grate. Okay. High, come on, you guys. Oh my goodness. Fuck yes, Jester! Oh man, we're like a strong couple of women. I dive in and follow. You guys want to try and meet us where that pillar is? Oh no. Sounds terrible. You want to dolphin ride my back? Yeah, I'm all right. I mean I might not be Fjord levels but yeah I can swim. It's the other way-- Yeah, all right. I wait... Deuces, you coming in? Yep, that whiskey's working. Ready? We're going to do this together. MARISHA AND One, two, three and we go. That weasel is about to die! An athletics check? Is that cocked? I can do the balance thing. Counts? It's a good roll though. It's the test. It's an okay roll. 21. I totally forgot about the weasel by the way. (out of breath) You did good. Can we get the dog to blink to us? I think so. Yeah do you have hooves? Holy shit, the dog and the weasel survived. A hundred foot swim underwater. But then what? While she does that, can I look and see if there's any writing on the wall? No type of directional marks? Any type of, using my background, any types of Thieves' Cant for smuggling? Fuck you Gil, you haven't been good to me today. You said perception? 20 total. Hey Fjord? Is it about time for high tide? I really feel like this is like something and it might attack us, and it might kill us. I don't know, maybe-- Mighty Nein! I'm going to take my two shurikens and (throwing noises) into one and see what happens. From Kentucky, it's sure-ooh-ken. For two? Both of them? That first one is an 18, so 25. And the second one is 15. Yeah, I think this is a thing. Like a thing to kill. Nine-- sorry. 12. 13 total, 13. 13 total. That's right! I almost forgot. Natural 20. 24. Guys! Anybody? Still me. (pop pop pop) Two attacks, one with my staff. Yes. That's a natural one on that first attack. Well that sucks. Second attack. Still not great, 15. Oh wait, but that hit before, right? Okay, seven damage. My second attack. Still with my staff. Two attacks with my-- right. Attack, attack. Okay, I'm going to use my off hand, I'm going to drop my-- I'm not going to drop my staff. I'm going to put my staff around, focus my chi, and then do a palm attack. Fuck. Nine. Cool. Yep. I have my goggles. That's a natural one. He took an arrow to the knee. Sorry. Just go for it! (gurgling sounds) I haven't felt anything since she left! (deep voice) Thanks! (deep voice) Hey! Dope. (deep voice) I'm back! Can I do like a cool, monk-like kick and go pop pop! Like two unarmed attacks as I kick-kick with my legs? Some capoeira shit? First two unarmed. That first one is an 18, being a 25. Second one's an eight, being a 15. (Valley girl voice) Oh my god, Tracy's back! My dad sent me to a fancy prep school. Oh, that's a suck balls roll. Two ones on my sixes. So two, but I got a four and a three from that extra d4, so nine. Nein! I'm now going to spend a ki point because I hit twice to do Extract Aspects. I want to learn-- That's right, we switched that. Oh! It's just an ability I get to use now. Right. So, I hit twice. I would like to know its constitution saving throw and if it has any damage... not resistances, but the opposite of that. Vulnerabilities. Okay. I just shout it out and say, I think if we freeze the thing, it'll like freeze because water! And then I'm going to spend another ki point and do Flurry of Blows. Pop pop with my fists! First attack is a 22, sorry 23. No, 22, I was right the first time. The second one is not good, it's a nine. That is-- ooh! Ten damage. Yeah. Yep. Nein! It's like that glass of water in Jurassic Park. You're you in the opening title sequence right now! You're doing-- You're doing it! It's so real. (laughs) Oh, the one next to me. Thanks! What size are the stones? Just curious. Wait. Is he ten stones? That's very astute. And we're heading inward, right? Okay. Am I still big? How much longer am I big Beau? Aw. Are you still blind without your cantrip? I'll be in front of Caleb and be his train. Bee bo! Hold. Big square room, gets bigger, it's changing. Like balconies? Do the balconies go all the way across? Sorry, I'm not asking Caleb or anything. Do you see any movement? I ask Caleb. It's everywhere! Yeah, yeah. He has a bad feeling. Like something in your lower parts of your intestines? What makes you think it's magical? I'm pretty good at actually climbing. This is through Frumpkin? 24. Why would they have a patrol in a sewer system? Zsundie? Balcony seats, though. Good view! Who says that? Zsundie? Maybe we can talk to him? He seemed like a genie. It feels like a genie circumstance, right? I don't want to fight this guy. Let's try and talk to him. Yeah, we want to kill Algar. You said roll for initiative? Going to use my boots. Not too bad. The water elemental that I rolled against had a plus three to its constitution. Maybe. I can find out, though, if I hit twice in a row. If there are any stats that are beneficial to any of your guys' abilities, let me know. If you want to know, if you want to take the risk. Steve, you're the best. Wait, it's going? Ay! Wait, no. I thought it was Fjord, Caduceus, Yasha? What did you have, Caduceus? Okay. You're right, I'm sorry! You're right! I'm wrong! Which one is Algar? They all look the same when they're minis. Oh, he is taller. You're right. Oh. It's on the genie guy. But Algar might have something. I don't want to fight the genie guy. I'm going to go for Algar. Okay, I'm going to see what I can do. It was really awesome when the-- (cheering) Is that it? Ay! (singing) Bill Nye the science guy. Look at all that vapor. Yeah! That smokiness. Misty! Okay. I want to do some parkour, awesome dope monk shit, and be like (repeating) bink. And see if I can get to here, 40 feet? Can I do that? Oh! Real good on both ones! I'll take that 16 from Gil. I take it all back, Gil. LIAM and We're at 22. I will accept that. Here, you said? Do I-- Fuck, but that doesn't give me-- Fuck butt. Do I have any more movement? (counting) 25? Can I still try and go further one? With my 45 feet of movement? Okay I've gone (counting) 20, arguably 25 to 30. Can I just then try and get here? Copy. With still disadvantage? Not as good that time, Gil. 12. With ten more feet! Can I be like Excuse me. Excuse me, Nott. Sorry. Oh, so I can only get-- Can I get behind her? Well then. And I can't see Algar? Fuck it, this is what I worked for. I'm going to go for it and try and do two shurikens right at his face. Three-quarters cover. First one is a 14 plus seven, so that's a big old 21! And then nine plus seven is a big old 16. Yep. Mm-hmm. A 21 and a 16. The first one-- mm-hmm, nine damage. Yeah. I go-- around the corner. Miss. Miss. 20 feet? Zsundie. Zsundie with a "J"? Sentinel attack Can I Sentinel that bitch since I'm next to it? And it's attacking someone who's not me? I rolled a 14 to attack the water elemental. Not great... six damage. Staff. Shit, I should have just punched it. Did I just waste something? What? Yeah. That's so cool! You did it! It was so good! That totally was, that was great! Yes! I threw a shuriken. Little dick. Big money. Where'd you get the rainbow dice? Ooh. Hans and Franz. What? No! Block the door. Large fries, motherfucker. Rue dies, motherfucker. Right in the kidney. I am going to steel myself for a minute, look at the water elemental to my right, and then cast Step of the Wind with a ki point and try and disengage like a rogue. It does, but it says you can spend one ki point to take the disengage or dash action as a bonus action. So I would have to take an attack of opportunity if I decided to dash instead of disengage, right? I'm going to risk the hit and take the dash. Miss! So my jump distance is also doubled for the turn. Can I be like, parkour, parkour, and jump. I'm going to try and jump up here. Is this disadvantage again or no? I'm not rolling Gil. That's a natural one. I move the rest of the way. I can't jump now? I can't use that double jump distance? Is that done, Step of the Wind? Okay, 22. (panting) Fuck, you guys. And I'm going to take my shurikens and pop pop! Whoever I can see. Who, the dwarf? Does it look like Jester chopped off Algar's hand? (shouting) No! Sorry! I'll go one for the dwarf, one for Algar. Pretty color for the dwarf. Balls, so many balls all the way around. We have nine for the dwarf, and we have 12 for Algar. Fuck! I don't have any more bonus actions, right, or anything? My worst nightmare! You have the necklace from Molly! Did you just talk Matt out of it? Yeah, that's cool. 11?! Can't die twice in a row. Yes! Looney Tunes style! Fuck you! But I mean it's fine, it's great. Yeah, stay dead, stay dead. And are dying. Not dead. Dying is not dead though. Yeah, yeah very. Yeah. Can a tentacle wield the lollipop? Yeah! That's fun. (gasps) But I thought he takes down two when he's dead? Ooh. Don't be a fucking creep! It's very extreme. It's very extreme. So if you move into that sphere, is it utter blackness? MATT and If I have dark vision goggles-- MATT and Does it help? Don't fuck with someone's mom. Could have made you more charming. Oh shit! It's me. Okay. I was going to say, I look over at Fjord across the parapet and I go Ah, what-- But how do I-- What do I do though, then? Fuck! I am going to-- I don't want to hurt him. I want to move away from genie homie, and then hold my action for-- Yeah, I want to move away from him and I'm going to hold my action until I can see preferably Aldar, but if not, one of the dwarves. Algar, not Aldar. Al Gore. Holding my action. Both of our clerics are grappled and restrained. Oh dex saves. Me and Fjord? Dex save. 15. What!? I rolled one less than him? How many? Do I-- (yelling) Catch me! Aw fuck. You're going to Aldar? Algar? Al Gore? I turn into the fetal position to cower and cover. (singsong) Live at seven p.m.! He's after me. Come on! Come on, Nott! I'm going to Step of the Wind again, to get up. (panting) Double my jump. Run, run, run as much as I can, more with my bonus dash. And then move again. (out of breath) I made it! I'm here! Okay. What do I-- Okay, I'm going to-- I go over to Algar and I do the MMA thing and I put my knee right to his face and I pin him down. And I'm going to just full-on grapple him down and hold him for my action. Oh oh! Oh, can I pull his bracelet off? (meta-gaming pigeon coos) But it was in my head! But it was in my head! Dammit! It was-- I thought about it five minutes ago and I forgot-- that's good, though. That's good. 19! That ends my go. Healing Word is the best! What does he want to say? Is that going to be you? You going to do that? Fjord MVP! Fjord! Yes! Yeah, you killed it this week! That was a great game!
