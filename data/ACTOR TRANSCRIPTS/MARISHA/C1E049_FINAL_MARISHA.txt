And by they're you mean us? Hector Navarro, aka @Hectorisfunny on Twitter, is the next host up for Signal Boost, and his first episode happened this Tuesday and he's fucking hilarious. You have to watch him. He's really funny. And this coming up episode might be one of my favorite ones. Yes, that's a true story. Anyway, give him love. Go watch it. It's funny. It's very funny. And he has great things that he boosts. What was my character's name? I know, but what was my character's name? Look, a lot's happened in a couple weeks, okay? I've moved, I've had a change of scenery-- Oh wait, I haven't seen this yet! I knew this day would come. Didn't we discuss sending him home? Vax, just because he's holding a dagger doesn't mean he's going to be successful at using it. You're wasting your time-- never mind. Heh, natural 19. 29. No, I'm sorry, 30. 30. I rolled a 19, my Perception's 11. I look at the group and I go-- Okay, okay. it looked like there were two orcs and they were carrying a body. No, they're headed away from us, correct? Away, they're going away? Thank goodness. 22. You got a natural 20? There won't be tracks if they're dead. Where, where, where? Can you point out those barrels one more time? Yeah, but I'm full on hit points. Is anyone hurt? Flank them? As they're running-- Well, Scanlan can create a distraction, I can possibly take a few people out with my ranged spells along the way. Not today. Let Scanlan handle-- I almost called him Scandal, which is still appropriate. Let Scanlan handle the door, I can handle the distraction. You are, you're incredibly good at distractions. Where's Scanlan? Where did you go, Scanlan? Yeah, we want to do it towards us. Yes. No, that's where we wanted-- Put us more-- No, that's good, that's good, that's good. Sure. Can I have a Monster Manual? Conjure Woodland Beings? Maybe. Well, I can conjure a bunch of little creatures. Yeah, but then it wouldn't be me. It'd be something else that's not me that I can control? Okay, I'm going to say Conjure Woodland Beings. I don't know. Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out. You know, there's not a list of what you can conjure in the book. And it's very unfortunate. And it's some kind of fey creature. So what's a fey creature that's a challenge rating of two that would make sense? That's really scary? Or I can also summon like eight fairies if they're a low enough, you know-- Yeah it says the DM will have the statistics. Dryads? That sounds cool. Challenge rating of two. It's got to be a fey. Oh, it only has a challenge rating of one? LAURA and What are centaurs? Apparently. Okay. Well then, let's do two dryads. Two triads. Dryads. I don't know what it is. Two dryads. Right in where-- Thank you. Yep, here. Ish. Here. No, there. Yeah that's a little out. And Scanlan and I are far back. See, aren't you glad that wasn't me? That wasn't us! Wasn't me! It's all I care about! Keyleth is standing at the edge of the forest going-- Wait, can I go with you a little bit? Can I do a thing with him? Just avoid the pit! Oh, that's a good roll! Spent all that time figuring out what I was going to do and then they fell in a crack. 21. 21. The door's already summoned, yeah? Okay, you mentioned that a few were coming over and looking over at the edge of the pit. Are there still a few more at the edge of the pit? Sure. How far away is that guy from the pit? Okay, here's what I want to do. I'm going to go earth elemental, but I want to, like, do it like a badass, you know? So I see Scanlan-- Fuck! I did use scorpion. Fuck, damn it, we haven't taken a short rest. Then I don't do any of that. Instead, where's Scanlan? Did we? Are you sure? All right, fine! Okay, so I walk and I sink into the ground as I'm walking off, and I want to pop up next to this guy. And I want to throw his ass in the pit. (cheering) ...Territory. Strength check? 17. He's going to get crushed. He's going to crush the dryad. Yeah. WWPD. What would Pike do? 17 is my natural armor. Remember the love in your heart! (laughs) Walk around aggressively. Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughter) Yes, totally Indy-ed it! Silently. Oh no. Okay, I'm going to take the two dudes who are in front of me, you can tell me if I can do this twice or not, I want to do my multi-slam attack, my multi-attack slam, and I want to go, in as dictated in Common as I can as an earth elemental, knock. Knock. And I want to take their heads and go, boof-boof. Against each of them? Okay. Natural 19 on the first one. And a natural 18 on the second. (rock voice) Knock-knock. (normal voice) First attack is 13 plus-- 18 points. Second, not as good, ten points. Can I take his body and chuck it in the hole? It served its purpose. Yeah. Hey! I brace. Paladin or some shit like that. Ouch. Keyleth was like, aw, cute. (screams) Damn. Wait, I'm getting attacked by someone else, too? Yeah, both of those hit. 24? Whose? His. Two guys and a bear with Charlie Sheen, new to CBS. Is this against the bear? Can't even kill a kitten. Who's left alive? Are we still trying to keep one alive? Sure. All right. Yeah, sure. I want to earth glide underneath and pop up underneath of him. The fire guy, yeah. Yeah. That's cool. First, I want to stamp him out in the fire, in the snow, sorry. Stamp out his fire in the snow. And then I'm going to, I want to grapple onto him. I want to start dragging him over to this nearby tree. Athletics? I've only got basic stats here. Oh. 19. 20, 20. Okay. Can I start dragging him over so-- Okay. I'll slowly start dragging him to this tree over here. So we can tie him up. Okay. Come on. (rock voice) Grog. And I put him in a nice little sleeper hold. Are there any other prisoners still tied up? I was going to say, before I drop my earth elemental form I start busting open some of these crates for quick lootage. (laughs) That's awesome! It's always the kids, man. It's always the kids. I drop elemental form and start helping Pike heal whoever needs healing. Two dryads. Yeah, can we take a short rest? But seriously, I eat some because I'm-- Keyleth's a little hungry. No, never said that. Wait, check it out and then? Your door is stationary, though, right? Darkvision is 60 feet, I wrote it down. Oh boy. Grog, you did sleep last night, right? And of course don't forget to tune in next week for our 50th episode. Shall we? Up the mountain! I'm assuming you told us when you got back. Frost-Willem Dafoe. Jif. Then I'll light up my hands a little bit. Oh, Elvish. Wait. So Percy read this out loud, right? Would Keyleth know anything about this as possibly being a portal to the realm of water? Can I do like a check to see if this is something that might be a-- Not my strong suit. I'm so smart. Just straight intelligence? 15. Okay, I pull out my Hunk of Quall. Hunk of Quall. I also happened to pack Control Water in my bag of tricks today. I did. When we go underground there tends to be water, so I tend to bring it. Keyleth walks up and puts her hands in the pool. Anything happen when I touch the water? I dive in. Not great. Two. Plus two. Is that however long your-- Interesting. How far does the tunnel look? Bad and bad. 16. 16. You want to keep going? MARISHA and 15. 15. What? What the why? What the why? Dolphins with lasers. Upon seeing this, I reach forward and I grab hold of him and I cast Control Water and jettison the both of us out of there. I kicked the camera, sorry. I take a jet, jetting us back out. Waterslide! Help! Can I take the Control Water to see if I can like waterbend it out of his lungs, if there's any water in his lungs? Really nasty plants. And I go over. I'm pretty sure my Control Water lasts for a minute, yeah? Dope. I'm going to go over, and can I start clearing the water out of this tunnel? Out? That's what I was thinking, making like an air tunnel. And how big was this tunnel? That's a big tunnel. I'll part it. Yeah. I yell to everybody else and I say, there's a tunnel through to the other side. Let's go. And I jump in and I'll sink and I'll start parting the water behind me. Or, let me see, let me sink to the bottom and then I'll part the water in the tunnel straight ahead. And before I jump in, I say, don't touch the plants on the edge. Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for, yeah. Let's go fast while I still have this concentration. Sure, displacement physics. Okay. Don't touch the plants, let's go. Forward. Following up their rears. They're assholes, don't touch them. Can I take the Control Water and jettison us all up like I did with Grog? Hold on! Three-point landing. Those things are death traps, man. They're the best. What does it say? Hang on. "The ones who made us--" Because we killed one of them. If you recall, there were also five dragons and we killed one of them already. It's the water cycle. It could. It said, "the water a door." Wait, and the hole is right above the water, correct? It lines up. It lines up. Does this harken back to anything that we remember about the telling of the Spark, or the Second Spark? All of the elemental realms overlap, which create our realm. Which is why there's gateways. I gave Vex the Hunk of Quall. Just hold it out like you're searching for a signal. Yeah, it means that there's magical essence, it finds magic. Good call, Percy! Well, I Druidcraft some earth and start wrapping it around the pillar. Gather close next to me, who's close nearby? I do a Wall of Stone as a pillar and pillar us up towards the hole. Elevator time. Can I at least rise us up to where we're close and we can get there? Where we're up and out. I do have the Immovable Rod. Here, catch, yeah, take it! I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to go and turn into a bird. I'm flying. It's gone, it's gone! So the only people that are left are Percy and Grog? Can I cantrip a Gust against the sand to try and blow some of it? Grog! I cantrip Gust, brush him off. Yeah. I never trust that. That's never been good. What did that riddle say? Something about a name. A name must be earned? So maybe this is us earning our name. And wind. Is there any runes or anything around in this room that look like they would indicate-- Well, do you want to bust out those Ioun stones you have? You also have your Ioun stones. Upon hearing this, Keyleth drops to her knees and does a Locate Creature. Do I sense any spiders? I think we're good on spiders. And is there anything behind the webs? Just rubble? I agree. I think this looks like a convergence-of-the-elements type of a room. I can light a fire in that pit. You know, we've always found that very offensive. I just want to say that. So this is going over the firepit, past the wispy-- Yeah, I'll take the left. No. Yeah, we're moving very slowly, not disturbing the air. We have no fucking clue! The golden snitch lives! I have the worst initiative rolls all the time except for earlier today. Seven. What is his name, Percy? Nice. Saving throw, correct? 23. 22. 23. Issylra is a continent, right? Okay. I yell out Issylra! Okay, that might be a continent. Not his name. And I cast Control Water again and I start pouring the water out of the pools and onto the fire. Okay, well, I stop that. Good to know. Can I do some sort of check to see if I would've heard anything about this type of a thing in my druid time, is this like a different plane of existence, what is this shit? Yeah, or would I know of what his name would be from the telling of the Second Spark and any of my elemental knowledge as a druid? Ooh, that's good. 19. Fuck. I don't know, you guys! No. I'm good. Paul was here. What? Well, that's a better roll. But Doctor who? 18. I know, we were thinking about that time. Vex jumped in the water? Cool. Also, look how attractive that map is. Dwarven Forge, everybody. Yeah, there's a correlation with blue. I have lots of theories, too. Oh, son of a bitch! All right. You're on the one on the left. Yeah? I can, I'm close by, I'm close by, I can handle it. That's Ashley. That's Pike, yeah yeah. Whispers! Yeah, how long is his name? You already did water, I'm wondering if there's anything in the other one, or I might try fire. K-A-J-I. K-A-J-I. But it could be any fucking order. Wait, wait, wait! Did anyone take note of the order on the cycle? SAM and Never mind. Okay. Seeing Vex jump in and seeing Percy stick his head in a wall, I run up to the fire column. Right there. And see if there's anything in the fire. And I take the fire hand and I stick it, and I light up my fire and I stick it in the fire. Does anything happen? Okay. Okay, I pull it out and I go fire elemental. And I stick my head, go into the fire. Into the flame! (cheering) I pull my head out and I go, M-A-L. The letters M-A-L. Against Scanlan? Oh, Jesus Christ. Good call. You are. You are. It's Pike. It's got to be Pike. Do I use my fire elemental constitution? 14. 14. Fuck me. 24. Come on, Grog. Snap out of it. Okay. Question as a fire elemental, I can fly, right? It says that I can, oh, movement? It doesn't really say, it says I can move through a space as narrow as one inch wide without squeezing. Can't fly. So if I go into that portal I'm going to be in the same fucking situation, I'm assuming. Okay, I'm going to drop my elemental form-- You still have my Immovable Rod? Okay, before I drop elemental form I'm going to go pick up the rod. It's so I can move faster. Pick up the rod. Drop my form. The Immovable Rod. And do I still have movement now as myself? I'll step forward a square. No, the other way. Yeah, yeah. And say, Vex, catch! Yeah. I think so. I think that's all I can do. O-R-I. Malkaoriji? Hang on, wait, before you move it, before you move it, put it back, put it back, put it back. Okay, I want to write it down. Hits. Miss. Hits. Miss. Maybe if we ask nicely, he'll make us young again. 17. Shit. We're doing all right. Maorikaji. And Kaorijimal. You should try that one. Are we young again? That's true, oh my god, you guys are never going to experience this ever again. Hi. At about that time, I lift up my shoulder and I show him the Slayer's Take symbol. Mythcarver? What was that called again? We can look at that list, so I can make some serious notes? I think we each need to be outfitted with something. We need our legendary weapons, you guys. Fenthras? Is that what it was-- no. Oh my god, it's midnight.
