Holy shit. You've said too much about it now. He has 40 floors! How we're a happy family, you know? I do feel like our teamwork has been getting better, though. We've been doing so good. Synergizing. Oh, a hundred percent. He's inspiring you because he thinks you're going to fucking fail. Stop. Get off of me! Why? Your hands are a little clammy. Oh god! Why are you sweating? Why are you nervous? You're nervous! No, that's his Silence spell that he got recently. Scanlan, are you experiencing a bit of cotton mouth? Maybe? Are your pupils a little dilated? I turn to Vax. What did you do? Towards Vasselheim. Tary, the Ashari. We activated the Chaos Orbs. Crisis Orbs. I always mess them up. We're not worried about you. What distributor do you get your wine from? Just curious. Okay. Do we have a plan before we get there? Before I teleport us into the middle of a city that might possibly be in the middle of a war zone? Also, I'm assuming he's traveling with an army. How long would it take us to get out? Oh, wait. We chartered that boat; do we care about those people? Or are we just going to leave them in the middle of the ocean? Okay, fair argument. We did put a 500 gold holding deposit on, an incidental that we will not get back. It would probably take us a while to get up and out to a tree, right? I'm being a little selfish with my upper-level spells. Okay, you know what? Don't worry about it, let's go. Let's just Plane Shift. Yeah. I Plane Shift us to Vasselheim. Where will you not get arrested? Trial Forge. Oh, hell no. Pass over? Maybe one of us. Maybe not all of us. Is the crazy zealot still running around? I walk up to him. Yeah. I believe you. I've seen it, too. Wait. How did he talk to you? Okay. Yeah, no. Accurate. Man, I don't know how to deal with that type of abrasive personality. But that guy resisted. He knew when others didn't. And he was crazy. I don't know. Can I do a nature check to see if this is above my capabilities? A minor miracle? This seems like a minor miracle. I could maybe try to carve out a patch of sunlight above us, but I don't think it would be anything more than a morale boost, at this point. We have to keep people from defecting to him. The more people that he has, the more of his symbols that get spread around out of fear, the more he'll win. I turn to one of the guards of Vasselheim. Sir! If there was a universal sign of Vasselheim, a symbol of Vasselheim, or a sign to fight, what would it be? (laughter) Okay. I didn't know if there was like a rally or cry or something that you all universally believed in. There's got to be something, a symbol of Vasselheim. All right, you know what? Never mind! Jeez, your politics. Thanks, Lieutenant, for nothing. Okay, maybe some sort of sign will help them. All right, we go to the temple of Sarenrae! Right now? Okay, go! And we defeated it! Kind of. Yeah, performs a miracle. He needs followers. (stammers) Just look outside. But I'm not sassing! Have you met them before? Are you friends? Are you on the same mailing list? I wouldn't be surprised if there is a spy in this room. You have citizens of your city that are starting to paint his symbol on their doors out of fear. This is the last thing you want in the middle of this crisis. All time spent with any volunteer hands need to be from any spare clerics who can help calm the minds of the afraid. Okay so the Crypts of (stumbles over words) Tholmeer? Crypts of Tholmayer and the Silted Veil. Yeah, which are the two places in the Zenwick Mountains? Yeah. Angry icy terrain or cannibal zombie dwarves. What all did we say? I'm rolling with someone's lucky die that I got delivered. AUDIENCE Yeah! Who's getting proposed to? All of us?! Why would you take it off?! What? Wait, did you make a decree and then turn to us and say, "What's your plan?" She wants that paper! Also, the hotel printer was broken. You know what? We should go shopping! No, Grog! No! And maybe we should convert. I should just stab myself in the eye right now. Let's do that. Silted Veil and the Crypts of Thromora. Fromora? But has turned violent, because nature is angry. Didn't he already hear our two options? MARISHA and Man, how does it work? Does he have several lines open and he switches back and forth? And how bored is this guy? Yeah, he's just trolling us! But if we know that's what he would do, then wouldn't he know that we would go to find him at what he would do? Undead icy zombies? You could always do like the astral projection thing, right? I don't know if it's for Pike or for the DM. She destroyed a whole undead army being a laser light beam. Remember, we've talked about this. There's also the thing that if she dies while Ashley's not here, we're fucking assholes! TRAVIS and She won't die if she's a (bubbling) thing. But we can always easily go get her. And now we have two immovable rods! (cheering) What? Yeah! Did you see that? They think we're going to die! (laughter) So what exactly is our plan? Is it to try and keep Vecna from gaining more forces, or are we trying to cut off Vecna and his forces? Then why go through the crypt? Is that not what other people are doing? But he mentioned Vecna has to be severely damaged-- So we're talking about doing this. Hey, DM? Logistical question how many days does it take me to make a 4th-level scroll? Spell. Spell scroll? 4th-level. How many days? Allura also said, yo, plan. Maybe plan a little. I have Freedom of Movement. But I have three 4th-level spells. I can start burning into my 5th-level spells, as well, but it lasts for an hour, so I was trying to figure out if there's a way-- Oh! Yeah! Oh my god, there is! That's hilarious! I like your technique! Fucking druids are badass! Four miles. He's passed them. If we get a little bit closer, I can do a Commune with Nature spell and try and figure out some stuff. It's all I've got. I can scry! The way they're heading. I can scry on Lady Briarwood. Ooh! All right, scrying on Briarwood. Oh, she rolls. 21! Is he still with her, though? Oh, hi Vex. All right. I'll scry on undead douchey. It was shaking-- Oh, is it on the back of some giant turtle or something? (laughter) It'd be so cute. Oh! (giggles) Yeah. Man, inspiring speech. So we're on a brass dragon? Wait, what? You know, Scanlan. (cheering) What I'm saying is, you should believe in yourselves the way that I believe in you, Scanlan. And the way that you believe in everyone else, Scanlan! Because you're all strong and unique. And we're probably going to die. (laughter) Ooh, cedar! Can I do a nature check? Yeah? (cheering) I am doing a nature check. If it looks like a path has been bore through in a straight line, like it looks like it's going through. 24. (anguished sounds) It is a giant turtle! It totally fucking is, yeah. Yeah. Probably bigger? Can I do a nature check to find out how fucking big this guy is? Yeah! Let's do this lucky one. That's not too bad. 28. Hang on, though. Caverns. Undead caverns of dwarves inside the titan. Yeah, maybe, or fight it from the inside out? I do a bit of a Gust spell ahead of us to clear the path, give him a little more visual line of sight. Yeah. Theory time. Maybe. This primordial is marching with Thar Amphala on its back to Vasselheim. If I were a god, wanting to prove that I'm awesome and do a big miracle thing, I would drop a giant city on top of another city. Can I do it, too? I do. Well, I grabbed some, so I can cultivate more of it, yeah. Let me see what I packed. Okay. We could do Wind Walk. It's going to take a minute to transform in and out. I also have Animal Shapes. I can throw out a fog cloud and try and fog us the rest of the way. We're in clouds! Oh. Yeah. That's a good point. You make yourself more nauseous by closing your eyes. 30. That's it? He's leaking from the back of his calf. From the back of his hip. I don't think there's any landing. I think there's going to be-- yeah. But you know what? Let's see what happens. This is a group success or failure thing, right? Vax! Whisper! Wait, what? He hits. Our entire relationship has been psychic damage, baby. (sputtering) Hold on! And I go giant eagle form. No! Keep going! (cawing) Tell them! Keep going! I dodge it! I try and dodge it! It's just on me? Add a d4, yeah? Four, yeah! Okay, 24 total! You said 87? Okay. I immediately drop form and start falling. I'm okay. Oh, I'm still invisible as I'm falling. (yelling) I'm sorry! Oh, trying to go for J'mon? By the ponytail. Okay. I immediately cast Control Water and suck it inside.
