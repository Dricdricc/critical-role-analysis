Yay! Yeah. Which one did you get, Liam? This is the rosewood? Purpleheart. Chicken heart. Yeah, trade me seats for a second, Liam. We're Rat Queens. I'm Violet. You should. And what does Violet say? We're going to put the kick-ass back in team. Something like that? Rat Queens. It's great. Yeah! Oh, look who just showed up. He made all of that, by the way. You wanna roleplay as the character you're dressed as. Yeah, it's hard. Don't do that. Overnight rebellion! Four? Four. There are six barrels. One is empty. Are we back in our hole where we were? Yeah. Yeah, I mean we can literally camp next to the roots of the tree if we want to. I made it look nice in there. I can clear out a bit more space. Speaking of nervous habits. I was also thinking about the weird cough that you have. I don't think you're getting sick. What's going on? Oh, and we've tunneled, right? We're below the ground. Let's go down into the cellar. I'm going to go ahead and throw up some walls. I can do the false terrain-- I'll do Hallucinatory Terrain, and I will make it look like she said. One story, no cellar. Just wooden floor, yeah. No one's here, looks like it hasn't been touched. No, in fact, you pulled down your mask, which you don't normally do in battles. Who? Could you feel it happening while it was? Were you conscious? Do you remember what you did? And Percy, how long after the coup and after you lost your family was this dream? You're speaking of these as if they're metaphysical beings. You're serving revenge. That sounds very literal, and from what I've seen, isn't inaccurate. How would you disappoint us? Just because you started on this path for revenge doesn't mean you can't find other motivations along the way. Do you believe you're not doing this with your friends or for your friends? Not even a little bit; it's only a hundred percent revenge? I miss Pike. (laughs) Suiting. Whenever he starts a description with "I mean," it's not good. Yes, they've been oppressed, but we've also seen there's plenty of cases of people being charmed by them. We might have an army of people who will die for the Briarwoods at any cost and not even realizing they're being charmed that way. Percy, do you realize we tried to talk to you for a good 15 minutes after all that last night, and you were unreachable? Do you remember that? So us saying if you start getting out of control, and you think that we're going to be able to be like, yo Percy, calm it down a bit-- Well, maybe we should, now that we have the knock-Percy-out-in-case-of-emergency plan, should we have a revolution plan? Because we seem to be divided on that. I can, actually. Yeah. You want to get a beat on the vibe of what people are saying out there? Well, there's a few people in our party who are good at that. Okay, that's plan number one, then. I think it's not a bad idea that we spread this de Rolo family crest around. Magic shop? Okay. Are we tunneling there? It's nighttime! No, I think Hallucinatory Terrain lasts for-- Okay. Which lasts for 24 hours. I was going to say, it would be probably a me and you thing. In terms of making us not as noticeable, Seeming is probably going to be our closest thing. I don't have anything-- I've got my Antilife Shell. We can all get a good night's sleep, I think, if I tunnel us in and we've got Hallucinatory Terrain. Yeah. Of Hallucinatory Terrain? It's 17. No, 18. But I know they have to make an intelligence save to see through Hallucinatory Terrain. Exactly, hypothetically. Yeah, Percy can't watch alone. Bagel? It's getting colder? It's another damn ghost wraith thing ghosting in. That's kind of funny. (laughter) You guys might be sporking. Can they do that? Yeah. Click, click. Dagger, dagger, dagger. I'm Jimmy Falloning so hard over here. 12. It's only our first hour. What? Like a level-4 magic missile. (sing) Rhinestone cowboy. Dual wielding! Are you proficient in that? Did I just get seriously boned in initiative? Am I still sleeping? I'm still asleep, guys. Well, I'm real groggy. How many's left? Three? Whoa! Okay, I thought it was for a second. Okay! What's the situation with the vampires? That's all of them clustered there? Vax? Where is Percy? You're against the wall. I get up. Can I reach around Scanlan, doing another reach around-- And I see as I reach around. I'm like, aw, really? And I'm blasting-- I'm blasting a Sunbeam. Those two. It's a line. Are they in a line? Can I shift to where I can? That's what I want to do. And I yell to the party Shield your eyes! Awesome. I roll a bunch of d6s? How many d6s do I roll? Full damage. Okay, so that is 15, 19. Not bad. 21 plus 12, so that's 33 radiant damage, and they are blinded. Where I can also not look at Scanlan's penis. That was cool. So there is one alive? And he's on Vax? Okay, I see that. I turn and I see him, and I'm gonna take a Grasping Vine and wrap around it and yank him, trying to beat him up against the wall on the other side. Yep. Yes, it is. I conjure a vine-- I think it just happens. Nope, 18. Yeah, I think so. Nice! Wood dagger! They misted in. I wrote all that stuff down. What time is it, midnight? Can I do some sort of check to see if the Sun Tree is their spawning ground? Just a straight intelligence check? Okay. That's a natural one. Sure, fuck it. Leave it up to chance. All right. I can't. I blew all my natural energies doing that Sunbeam. Wait, are you talking about when Vex and I came back with Clarota and he helped us for quite a while? Is that what you're talking about? Yeah, you're right, Vax. Vex, let's stay. Are there two stories? I technically used my Hallucinatory Terrain spell to make it look like a one-story tavern. That I can do. I'll do a Wall of Stone where I tunneled. Can we pop open a bottle of that wine? I'll go with Vax because I haven't been yet. Half-elves, what what. Cue internet rage. Saving throw? Oh right, because we've been in a cursed land for a while. Jack-of-all-trades? 24. Oh god, look at that smirk on his face! What does that mean? Now what? Can we do a check to see if there's any jerky or anything in the cellar? Did we already do that? Are we tunneling through this entire city? I have one. So are we breaking up? Are you two going to scout the town and the rest of us will-- The rest of us are finding a new hideout? We've got the earrings. Okay. I like that plan. I was going to say I'd leave that up to you. Dorito. I like that. Hot. I might have to de-armor. I've taken my scarf off because it's really hot. It's really hot in here. All right. That was Vox. But they already know what we look like. I thought we dropped Seeming, though? True. Even newer people might be suspicious. No, we're walking around. Did he ever tell you about any details of this special assignment? Yeah, can I do a perception check around the room and see if there's any indications that the Briarwoods might have-- Yeah, a bug? Like some sort of something where they might be monitoring this place. Yes. That kind of bug. Not bad. 26. It's true. (laughing) No, you're stuck. Miss, do you know the full name of Percival de Rolo? Percival Von Musel Von Lichtenstein de Rolo III. de Rolo III. That's it. Percival Fredricks Von Stein-- Oh my god! It's another Rod of Holding. Immovable Rod. That one. I was combining Bag of Holding and the Immovable Rod. Combining them. Yeah, we did. Tiberius put it somewhere, and it never came back. He might have. Tiberius had one. We didn't use it much. I'll take the rod. Also, we're going to have two more staying with us, if that's okay. Let's not make ourselves known. I want to see this. I want to hear what's up. Yeah. Any familiar faces in the audience? Working hands, farmers. Was your informant by chance named Simon? The ziggurat. Archibald Desnitt? Oh shit! Goran Quagmire? LAURA and Yes, what would start an uprising? Act now? Who's this? LAURA and She may not be a vampire. Wait, you want to go bam-bam-bam? That I'm cool with. Percy, how much do you want people to see the de Rolo family crest? How much do you want people to know of your presence here? Do you want a big proclamation? Because I might have that. Yes. Because I learned a trick back in the day from my father and the Air Ashari people. We used to do it as kids for fun, but it might be perfect in this circumstance. Dual-wielding. I can Skywrite for you. In the future, they came up with these awesome things called-- SAM, MATT, and Yeah, skywriting with clouds. Yeah. Do we want the gray clouds to go away? Maybe temporarily. Temporarily, yeah. All right. Let's do it. When do you want the symbol to go up? Lit the houses up? Yeah, I think I could. Why is it raining again? I'm going with Scanlan. I wasn't trying to help you. I was trying to write the de Rolo symbol in smoke. I don't really care about you. All right, I'm going with them. No, that's what Scanlan said. What are we doing? Wait, what? What are we doing? We're watching all this happen? We're all like, oh, there goes Grog. I guess we're going. Let's flank. LAURA and You said there was a door around back? MATT and I'll go around back. He's fine. I'm waiting for smoke. You can't put claymores on your back, which is a big fallacy. Ruins every game. TRAVIS and It's the toy that all your kids are going to bitch and scream and want, and you're going to be like really, it's the most expensive toy? It's like $150. It's like the toy of the year, man. It's cool.
