So we lose an hour of sleep. Oh man! People on YouTube always get mad at us. Those people you just addressed. Pregnant rage. I have one final announcement. Key Question just came out on Tuesday! It's a show that Key and I created. We talk about Deadpool-- Matt Key! Watch Alpha! For those who want to watch it and don't want to pay for Alpha, you can get a free 60 days with the promo code "question." There were a ton of people who responded to my tweet with the promo code in it saying, "Yeah, but I don't want to have to pay for Alpha." You need to read further down the tweet. I'm telling you now! Promo code Alpha-- no. Promo code for Alpha Question. 60 days. Go watch shit. Not bad, I did okay. Can I do a quick case of the room? See if I see anybody suspicious? Perception check. Okay, that's not too bad. 15. Penis necklaces. Gnoll penises, yeah. And so the two, the dragonborn and the female elven lady seem to be running the joint. Copy that. Hey, Jester, it looks like there's a game of cards going on over there. Just tossing it out there. You don't have to take my-- What? Yeah, it's fine. Yeah. Seems like a room. People in it. Yeah. How many rooms you got? What was your name? Wessek the Trim. Yes! Grift it, girl! I'm confused. Is she actually that young, or is that part of the game? Is that part of the scam? Roomies! Oh I love her. Yeah, I'm bored. Let's go. All right. Obnoxious One, I'm with you. (click and knock the same pattern) Crownsguard Bryce. Converse. Right? I do the dude at a bar thing and push up my biceps. It does seem like crownsguard tend to be assholes. Have you ever had any issues with the Crownsguard? We've heard rumors. Do we need to kick someone's ass for you? The Umber Dungeon? You know, tourists. We have that tourist look. Wait, no one studies history, really? Do you not have a good public school system or something? I was just curious. Like private school? Magnet programs? All controlled by the Soltryce. You mentioned all the sanctioned shrines. Are there any unsanctioned shrines? So six, that's it? Six approved gods. Great corner office, by the way. You have a window! That's great. Really, now? He wallows in the underbelly shit? That's what you said? That's me asking the DM. The bachelorette party? Are you helping run some underground clubs? In your cellar? I trail with Fjord! I want to know. What? Oh, but that was badass! She had a cool fucking office, I guess. Oh, no? Can I try it with you? You're really attractive. You're really attractive. Is that worse somehow? You're really attractive. No? That still wasn't it? Fuck. Thank you. At least thanks for telling me. Most people would just be like, "You're a bitch," and then would leave. Thanks, man. I think you're real nice, too. Genuine! I was being genuine! Just looking for good conversation. We're a bit skeptical. We're looking for support, just like any other wayward souls in this crazy town. We want to be able to trust our Empire, but maybe we need some reassurance in one way or another. Persuasion with advantage? That's good! I got a natural 18 with a plus one, so 19. Just being real vague. See, we're not the only ones. We felt like something's been missing. Please, yes. (grunts) (grunt) Beau. Absolutely. I know I, for one, have had my discontent with the Empire, so it's good to hear we're not alone. Yeah. I'm going to wait behind. Wait to talk to Dolan? Yeah, thank you. So much. How often are the meetings that heated? That seemed pretty intense. Where abouts in town do you live? We'll probably be staying here the next few days. It's Claudia. Wine? Is there good wine? Any good wines? That I would recognize? Okay. Sure. Can't access that. Yeah, and I totally called Claudia on it too, and she didn't even come forward. I'm like, you're running some shit! She's running some shit. Did you notice he said thanks for keeping things close to your chest? Are we that transparent? Right. (yells) I give Frumpkin the finger, hoping Caleb will see. Now I'm just flicking off a cat. We go back. You also traveled with a group of people. Do you notice how often his logic falls apart? No. I told them I'm Beau. Yeah. there's a lot of people named Beau. Right? I guess I stay behind with Fjord. We talk about the crazy shit we just heard. Fuck yeah, man! We'll break the system! Put it in the ground! Fuck the man! Morning, Jester. What? Your-- okay, yeah. Are you-- How do you know? How do you know that it's going to be there? Okay, but asking isn't the same as confirmation of receiving. Yeah. Totally. Let's go. I'll go with you. Okay. We have to look pretty? Okay. Yeah. We do. We stumble downstairs. Under the Nein? Get that smut, boy, get that smut. Mm-hmm. Blacksmith first and we'll see, how about that? We met an ex-physician. Just...never mind. Never mind. Yeah. To... the... Spark Hammer Smithing! (laughter) Like when you see like knights-- Yeah. "I'm going for the green knight!" That. Ooh, what's he saying? What do you expect from the Crownsguard, though? He's going to think you're crazy! Like Arnold Schwarzenegger. You want an anonymous reputation? Plus, what makes you assume we're about anything right now? I don't think we've made any decisions. I thought we were just having fun, right? Making good money? Are we about anything? I didn't say it, he did! Wait, wait, wait. We're the ones that you don't know? What's going on with-- You two take off every day! The two of you! Maybe you would know what we're up to if you went along with the group once! Yeah, super personable. Okay, you're super insistent about this, so I'm going to go with it. Because now I feel like it's real important to you. Sherpa us to our first bathhouse experience. Thanks man, thanks. I'm sorry, were you trying to tell me about-- I'm sorry, what? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay wait! Damn it! First time Liam's walked away from me in the campaign! There were then chains, the manacles. Cart, we definitely drug here. Definitely around Fjord's neck. Oh, were they in the bag? I show him the rune. You know anyone that might want a scary lion head thing to decorate their walls? What did you say the fancy tavern was? Lodge of the Eclipse. It's a bit of a tourist trap, but sure. Yeah, I lived here for like a short time, passed through. A few months. Yeah, it's pretty. I think it's this direction, if I remember. Aww, fuck. I don't think Caleb likes me. All right. All right. Hey, Caleb! Right this way! Is that-- fuck. Was that all right? Fuck. (louder) He said enthusiasm! Was that not...? Let's go this way. Ooh! Ooh, that's some dirty fucking shit. Harvest Festival? Harvest Close. It's in two weeks? In a fortnight. Victory Pit! Yeah, yeah! Big pumpkins. Mm-hmm. There's a lot of books in it and fancy people are super interested in it. I'm not entirely sure. I know that they're super into their knowledge. They're like "Eh, knowledge, means you're like powerful or something." Yeah. Knowing's better, yeah, books. Yep. She's an adult goblin woman girl, she's fine. Okay, I look around. Do I see Nott? Kind of haphazardly. Nein. You have shit all over your arm! Ew, you really are Caleb. What is that? No, that is-- I'm going to dad thumb you. That's gross. Take a gander? That's a lot of guards. But tiny? Oh my god. It's a very focused Fjord. Ooh. That's right up our alley! Extermination! The fucking Herald. It's the guy the town crier said. Besides, did you see how many posts on that board were all revolved around ratting people out? Stitches are just stitches? As we walk there I talk to Caleb. You mentioned being like "Bah! Empire!" Yeah. It's so cute! Oh, yeah. I'll take it. I go in, and I'm like that drunk person at the hot tub at the hotel. Hi, how are you guys doing? Excuse me! Scoot over! I got more friends coming. Told you. Fresh off the east coast! The fuck? She rolled with Molly. We are getting a reputation! It's deliberately con-- are they looking for nine people? That's something different from where I come from. Yeah. I wasn't going to tell you. So wait. You're creeped out by water and you're creeped out by fire? Man, covering the spectrums. Yeah. You know, that's actually-- Well, you keep your head above water. Here, I take Nott and I say, hold my hands. Just hold my hands. Okay, ready? And I pull Nott into the water and I go Now kick kick kick! There you go! Kick kick kick! Keep kicking! Keep kicking! Good job! And I put her back on the edge. It's okay. See? What was it? The Dawnfather, the Raven Queen, the Knowing Mistress, the Allhammer-- The Lawbearer! The Crownsguard have so much money. She has her own jingle. (singing) The best lay around! One, and a two, and a three! A sucker, at the end of this. From Jester, not from me, but you'll get a sucker. When you say "pulled you from hell," though-- What? She brought it up. Yasha, it's interesting to see you without your cloak. You were super adamant about that one. Sure. Hot tub, you know. Uh-huh. Do you need a towel? Do you need me to get the hard-to-reach places in your back or anything for you, while we're here? You guys know how Shak√§ste was all like (shushing) and secret, you know? Yeah, he was all like, "I'm mysterious." Have you heard of him? Everywhere he went, he was like, (shushing). He was super badass. I was into it, I didn't feel demeaned by it. It makes me feel good, makes me feel safe. I'm just saying, maybe we can-- MARISHA and Damn it. I was going to say, I wait and watch all my friends get out. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we paid a lot for this. No, it's good. We're in hot tub chicken right now. No? Yeah, it's honestly kind of my thing. Do I get a nice view? MATT and And now I get out, yeah. Three-point landing. As we walk up, I'm going to take my robe, and for the first time any time this party has seen, cross it over and tie it more traditionally. Can't we all go under The Mighty Nein? Damn it, I can't say it now. Lawrence. Ashley, that's DocuSign, you're in the wrong app completely! But you don't know what did it? Thank you. Bye. Theoretically. Not that I want to be a-- what's the word-- "shysta"? If they don't know what the monster is, and we have a perfectly good manticore head-- If we get the gold first. We found a manticore, who knows, they make nests. Do you think the blacksmith cares what the Empire is doing? The blacksmith is just trying to survive. If the blacksmith knows. Karen and Rothschild. Come on! (exclamation of surprise) Rejected! No! Not okay! You kicked his cat into oblivion! Oh, magic shit. You just made some guard's night. I wonder how much of the Tri-Spires is like this? Right? There's clouds painted on the ceiling for no reason. The guard's a critter! Damn it! Yeah! Hi-- oh. What time is it? Oh, it's beast killing time, yeah! Yeah! Yeah, here's to abandoning expectations! Before we enter, Beau says Wait, should we have done research on what we're fighting? All right, let's go! (laughter) If it's a vicinity thing-- I agree, I think you just need a nice coat. A nice coat can get you porn. Take care of my boy, home-state. Be good to him.
