I wonder how many people are going to lose money on us tonight. Table Right! Yeah, that would have been great. To have then. Mm-hm. So clutch. Mr. Loot-Drop over here. Exactly where the ranger should be. Four. So about 50 feet up. 16. Four. Are you at the top of the tower too? As part of this round we what? Is that a hut, is that what those are? Shit. It's like a paintball arena. Oh, god. It begins. Can I just run up, and just check that water right in front of me? And really fast, put my foot in it and see if I can see how deep it goes? Let me take my staff. And just put my staff down a little bit. It's pretty deep? Oh, I touch the bottom now, though? Okay. I'm going to cast Freedom of Movement on myself. And then can I move around to this side, here-ish? This side here-ish. Over here. And hide. That's fine. You're going to be a guy in a hamster ball being carried around by robot? It's pretty awesome. Is it totally invulnerable type of shit? So wait, but you can't cast spells out either? If I was an air elemental, could I go into the sphere? Just conjecturing. Yeah. But I'm a breath of fresh air. Oh my God! Me too. That's kind of true. Ten rounds, that's a long fucking time. Okay, question. The radius of the (energy field sound effect). I have Freedom of Movement, do I seem to not be affected by that? Cool. I'm going to move up and forward this direction. Yeah, one, two, three, stop right there! Do I see Doty? I can move one more square, correct? Okay. Move me up to the doorway, up one more. That's good to know. I'm going to, on top of Doty, cast a 5th-level Flaming Sphere. He's prone. 18, 20, 21, 22! 22, and then-- I don't get any other bonuses, okay. I'm going to say, sorry, Tary! And then go (whoosh) and go fire elemental form, and hope that this isn't a mistake. Wouldn't hurt me none. Can I do any more movement with my elemental form? I'm going to pop into the room. Throwing up the wine you drank earlier. I have to make a wisdom saving throw? I've got crazy high wisdom. 22. Is he not affected by the gravity thing? I look to see if he's going to keep going. Okay, know where Grog is. Is there any windows in this little shack that we're in or-- No bars or cracks or crevices? No, fuck that. Okay, I'm going to move out-- sorry. I'm going to go up to Trinket over here. Can I get into Trinket's space? Well, let me do my attack first. I'm going to be like, good job with the ball, buddy! Shh, go to sleep! Go to sleep, we'll make it less painful for you! We'll make this very painless. Go to sleep. I'm sorry, I just can't have you messing stuff up right now! That's true. I'm trying to smoke him out first. 15 for the first one. Natural 20 for the second. I get to reroll ones. I also get an extra d6 for my fire hands. And then I double die roll, right? 14, 15, so 30, plus 33 fire damage. And then I'm going to use my bonus action to turn over and take my flaming sphere and go (whoosh) and ram Tary again. Doty, sorry. 19. 20. Those don't count, it's fine. That's not great. I can reroll that one. Two, four, six, eight, 11 points of fire damage. Sorry! Sorry, guys! I'm going to take my other 25 feet of movement that I have left to go back into the-- 50. I go back inside for cover. I'm sorry for beating up Trinket. Yeah. Vex is mad at me. That would be so fucked up. (laughs) That's so true. It's so true. Oh! Oh shit. No way. You are lying! If he gets sucked into a random void, I imagine that would be considered defeat? Oh shit! So much just happened! Okay. I'm going to turn around and be like (screams, booming) on both of these guys. I'm going to move into Vex's space and then attack Grog. (bam, bam) Correct. 15. Second one, much better. That hits. 16 plus six is 22. Oh, I'm attacking Grog. That's 20 fire damage. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 1d10 fire damage and catches fire. Five for Vex and four for Grog. Oh, on that first one again? Nope. This is going to hurt. Okay. Is that halved because it's bludgeoning? No, his weapon's magical. Yeah, when he attacks me, he takes another 1d10 damage. Sorry, I'm an asshole. Eight. Okay. I'm going to back out and around again, through the room. Do I have any more? Yeah, let me go out one more and onto this lip next to Trinket. And I'm going to take my bonus action to take my Flaming Sphere, and I want to jump it over this shallow end on this far side. I've got cameras right in front of me. It can jump over a ten-foot gap. 30. Can it get ten more feet over? To the edge? If it looks like it's not going to land in the acid, and extinguish it or something weird? Would it extinguish it? Then I'll keep it there on the edge. Yeah, I'll take that. 16. What do I have to get over? So he did 25 damage. So yeah, I'm good. Snitch is failing you tonight. You're close, though. (heavy breathing) Okay, Vex is flying. I'm going to take my bonus action, go ahead and get this out of the way first, to get my Flaming Sphere over that gap and ram it into Trinket. I'm a druid. I'm sorry! I feel bad about this. Six, 12, 18, 22 damage. Okay, I still have my full movement, right? You could roll a natural 20 and save it. I'm going to haul ass. Do I have enough movement if I dash, or whatever, to get into that building? Yeah. (counting) Yeah, I'll try it. I'm not going over water, man! Can I peek in? Cool! Oh, right! Oh my god! Okay. I'm going to use my action to expend a level-2 spell slot to heal myself. With my spell slot to heal myself in wild shape thing. I can't use my action? I'm basically wasting an action to do it instead. Okay. Where are my d8s? Here they are. That's not great. I heal nine hit points in my form. Thanks, man. I'm glad you're so approving. Come on, fire pillars, come on! Yeah, that's not a bad roll. Yeah, not bad. Yeah, might keep you alive. Oh, buddy! No. He's a fucking barbarian. Does he take any damage? That's just Grog putting his finger in the socket. Wait, are you rolling damage? How did that happen? Going to hold down the fort? You're looking down the barrel, man. So fucking nonchalant, like he doesn't know. He can still hit you if you run. So you could theoretically recover and come back. And the sound of the first cannon. And he's still on fire, right? Okay, I saw Vex shooting Percy? Okay. 20. No, 21. Okay. So I don't see anyone? Okay. I am going to start by moving my fire ball. Jeez. There's not a lot I can do. I saw Grog run by, as well, correct? I'm going to move out and around on this side, my movement over here. I'm going to go ahead and use my bonus action to heal a little bit more. Actually, no, can I use my action to heal like last time and use my bonus action to move my sphere? I'm going to do 1st-level. Five. Okay. And then I'm going to move my sphere right in front of the doorway. Yeah, however far it can go. Do I have any more movement? I'll pop back in the building a little bit, and that's it. That hits. Okay. (grunts) Going to go ahead and drop my fire elemental form. It's looking pretty rough now. Hope I don't fuck that up. And I'm going to peek around the corner and I can see Vex a little up on the tower. Don't fuck me, Gil, don't fuck me! Oh, that's good! 29. I'll be like, (yelling) your blue feather is very pretty against the stonework! I yell it through the earring, and it deafens her a little bit. (yelps) Ow, feedback. And I'm going to take my Spire of Conflux, and just to be sure, I'm going to call a Fire Storm down and blanket the tower, and I want to go down a little bit. So here's what I want. I want this. Rain fire down everywhere. Because I don't know where Tary is. I haven't seen him in a while. It's a fire waterfall. Well, my spell DC is 20. I get to reroll ones. Do you have one more? 7d10. No ones, but it's a pretty good roll. (counting) 26. (continues counting) 52. Was Tary in there, at all? Fuck! And I'm going to take my bonus action. I know Grog ran vaguely in this direction, so I'm going to take my 30 feet of movement of my Flaming Sphere and move it toward that tower that Grog is towards. Yeah, is that 30 feet? And then I'm going to pop back into cover, hug against the wall. Did you ever Hunter's Mark me? Oh yeah. I'm good. I rolled a natural 19. With my modifier, right? With my bonus? Yeah, I'm good. Nope. Don't have any more of those. Oh god. I don't know what to do. Okay. All right. Fucking hell. Okay. Fuck. Fuck! What am I going to do? If I do a Fire Storm around there, can I also call on the inside of the room, as well? Yeah, fuck it. Let's do that again. Pop out once again from the spire, (war cry) coming down. I only did it once, so that's seven, so that brings me to another seven, so I have six points left in the spire. Yeah. And because I heard Grog run in that area, too. I'm just lighting up that tower. That was one of my dice. I re-roll ones. Okay. I rolled two tens, so that's 20. Two eights, so that's 36. 41. 44. One, two, three, four, five, six, 44 plus seven is 51. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. 7d10. For my bonus action, I want to bring my Flaming Sphill to block this doorway that I'm in front of. Yep. Okay, and then I want to move back and... fuck. Around here, on the outside, and hide. Did you get where I said? I want to go on this side of the building to use for cover. Perfect. And then I don't have anything else I can do, do I? That's it. Can I also hide? Fuck, I hope that wasn't a mistake. Is anyone still on fire, like Grog? Another ten. I know, I look fucking crazy. Fuck! Did I get hit? Okay. Oh my god. This is so scary. I do have that thing I can do. Yeah, that Kill Everyone spell... It's time. It's time. I am going to, thinking of the acidy black pit in front of us, and remembering Umbrasyl, I am going to turn into an adult black dragon. (war cry) Full werewolf transformation. And I burn my Shapechange. I hope I don't die. I can move, right? So how deep is this watery pit? Does it go pretty deep? I am going to, as a dragon, see how far I can get. I'm going to go black dragon, who can swim and is immune to acid. I'm going to go (heavy footsteps) and see if I can lay underneath the surface of the acid. Nope. That's true. A little biased. I mean, I could accidentally trip over him and kick him into the pool with me, if you really want me to. That's it. You can't see me. Question. Sorry, before we move too far. Are people affected by my frightful presence within 120 feet? Those who are aware of me once I (heavy footsteps) and then go in. 120 feet, wisdom saving throw. Shit. What kind of a saving throw? That's true. Come on, acid! Well, they're big fatty dragons. Not great. Seven. Poison. 34? A lot. Oh, that's a natural 19. I have advantage. Okay. I'm under the acid, man. I poke my head out. Do I see anything? Okay. 21. Cool. I've got a good idea. I'm going to fly up. How high is the tower? (stutters) I've got a flying speed of 80 feet, so I'm going to go 40 feet up. I look at him and I say in Draconic, because I always forget. I go, Grog, check it out! Grog, look! I'm going to be like, sorry, but I've always wanted to do this. (vomit noises) And do an acid breath. 60-foot line, five-foot wide. I'll roll five and then I'll roll five more. Actually, give me one more and I'll roll twice. Get that out of there. Yeah. 16, plus let's do these two twos, which is four, which brings us to 20, plus another 12, so that brings us to 32. And then I roll again. 32, plus another 14, which is going to be 46, plus three, which is 49, plus another six, which is 55, plus another eight and another seven. 55 plus-- 70, total. Acid damage. Do you have one hit point left, or some shit? The fire's out, which is ironic because that means at the top of your turn you could have theoretically died. With the remainder of my movement-- I still have more movement. Can I go, oh fuck! in Draconic and go (boop) right back underneath the acid? I have an 80 fly speed. He doesn't have anything fighting against three-quarters cover. Are you still invisible? I'm like a Florida alligator right now. Fuck! Nope. I think that's the exact same thing I rolled last time. Don't fuck me, Gil. Don't fuck me. That's good. That's even better. 24. Just hide. Yeah, you're called a dirty camper. A camper! Like someone who camps in first-person shooters. Oh, you dick! You dick! (laughter) I'll get a cake from Porto's. Tary versus many horrible things. What about his weapons and all of this shit, too? What? Really? That one automatically succeeds at something? Bring it, bitch. That's true. That's how many fingers you have. Grog lives in intervals of fives. Did he get something stupid? He's going to the bag. Grog becomes cavalry. Okay, I'm going to come back out of the acid. (war cry) What do I see? I look towards where Grog was. (war cry) I'm going to fly over, and I'm going to land on top of the tower, and I'm going to do a multiattack against him. (heavy impacts) And frightful presence. I don't know if that affects an imaginary knight from a deck of cards. Yep, bite and two claws. That's a natural 19 on the first one. So that's 30. Not so good on the second one. That's 15. Okay, and then on the third, that's a seven plus 11, so 18. So two attacks. So one bite and one claw, I guess. 2d10 plus six, plus 1d8 for acid damage. Oh man, why does this keep happening to me? Okay, 11 plus seven is 18. Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. No, plus six. 11 plus six, so 17, and then 1d8. Four. Okay, so he takes 18-- wait, what did I just say? 17 piercing damage, and then four acid damage from the bite. Eight plus six is 12. 12 damage. Okay, can I take the rest of my movement to fly and hover above? That's fine. Would I get out of the sphere of the electrical attack? Then no, I'll just stay there. Does he get a retaliation attack? Yeah, you didn't roll high enough. Oh, that's not that great. I thought that was better. 15. Goddamn it. 15. A lot. I'm good. He's immune to fear because barbarian and raging. He ain't scared. To hit? Yeah. He could take me down. Damage? Yeah. Oh, right. Total? As long as I roll over-- Oh, constitution? My constitution's all right. I've been rolling over the minimum, anyway. No. Nope. Why were you like, ugh? You wanted a critical? Damage total? He doesn't get to attack, does he? Yeah. So 23 total. MATT and Yeah. Grog. We're friends, right? Remember me? Come here. I'm going to grab him real quick and I'm going to do Plane Shift. It's me, Keyleth! (grunts) The 20 is what I had. You are lying to me. You are fucking lying! I have a bonus and a movement. Okay. Oh god. Yeah, it was bad. I'm still all right. I have a bonus and a movement. Okay. I'm going to... take my bonus action to go oh, Grog! And cast a Grasping Vine. Fuck! Okay. I will do... options are dwindling very quickly. I have Freedom of Movement still on me, though. Does that aid me escaping? Okay. I'm going to do a bonus action to heal myself. Healing Word. Let's do a 3rd-level Healing Word. Sorry. You're right. 2nd-level Healing Word. So it's 2d4. Oh my god. 53. Okay. And then I'm going to-- fucking hell, I'm really tapped out. Okay, my mantle allows me to jump. My jump distance is tripled. Does that mean I could successfully back up and jump off the tower and potentially land safely? How about this? I'm going to go, sorry, Grog! And turn and run, and I'm going to do a full-on ninja-style jump and see if I can land on top of this roof? Parkour. Yeah. Just six? Six from the knight. Okay, that puts me at 46. Do I have advantage on this? I'm so bad at my athletics. I'm always so bad! 12. Ugh, I fucking twisted my ankle. How much? Four points? What the fuck kind of cone are you using? Even though I'm down from them? Tary wins. Dexterity saves? Oh, that's good! I am at 20. That saving throw may be the only thing that saves me. Maybe. Depends on how he rolls. I'm good! Shut your dirty mouth. Goddamn it, he was so close. I had him. Twice! I had you twice! Time for a beautiful and glorious death. I almost teleported his fucking ass. I'm unconscious. (laughing) So cold! Look. Strength check. I got to use the tattoo. If Tary wins, I'm going to be so happy, even though dirty fucking camper. Dirty camper. This is your fault. Oh, you almost tripped in the acid? That would have been awesome. Damn. It would have been so cool. I know. I'm still laughing at him saying that at the top. 19. That 19 will haunt me for forever. Wait, what? All right. I just thought if you cast it as a higher-level spell, you couldn't do it as a lower-level spell? If you land in the acid, dude-- I love that he's getting so cranky about rolling natural 19s. Or 15 more seconds. He's undead! You're getting him with a greatsword? Oh my god, he's still fucking alive! DC 25! He's going to make it. Water Plane. Water dimension. You would have just drowned. I didn't know your charisma was-- I thought you had zero. All he had to roll was an 18 or lower. Anything else. The one that I was in for a lot of the time. It was the one I was camping out in. I almost thought about taking it just so no one else could have it, but never got to it. Level 20 Keyleth is nasty. I get unlimited Shapechange. I thought I was going to take the light down. Yeah. I thought that's what he was going to fucking do. I can't believe that. You would have bamfed, and then it would have been down to Tary and I. Yeah, you could have died 80 times. You pulling that knight probably changed things because he did just enough damage to me to make it a pain in the ass. Two clerics? That's right, Kash. And I was the runner-up with Pike, too! Goddamn it. I wasn't the runner-up tonight. You jammed all of your guns. I can't believe you jammed all of your guns. How did you do that?
