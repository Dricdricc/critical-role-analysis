We're like the only show that a sponsor's going to let us get away with botching their product. I don't like millennials. I'm a Centennial. If you watched Talks Machina this week on Tuesday night, you saw that we gave away a promo code, hashtag-- no, no hashtags. It's just a code. Just the code "TALKS." Like if you're talking, like I'm doing right now. "TALKS" as in Talks Machina, and that gives you 30 days free trial on Alpha, so if you're a good gamer like Sam is-- You know that those things stack, so you can use your free subscription from Amazon Prime, and then use another 30 days, and then it's only 30 more days before your checks expire and then they're not good anymore. Anyway, yes. Promo code "TALKS." Oh! You should also go watch Talks Machina, too. It's good fun. So we have Critical Role socks, which apparently they've done really good, we've already sold half, and people are already super excited for us to have character-driven socks. We came up with Socks Machina at the same time that we came up with Lox Machina, which is our branded smoked salmon. Oh, with little fur on top? Do we have Pass Without a Trace? We've done it before and we can do it again. Ten total. It just means you won't die first. Can we all move up a little bit? Pike! Can you sense her? Like she's got something masking her, that whole thing? Right. Okay. Keyleth steps forward a little bit towards the twins. Keyleth just says, "Did you find what you were looking for?" And this is the answer to your... disease you were looking for? Your curse? I'm assuming it has something to do with the soul gem. Do you think you can resist the same type of madman mentality that Thordak fell victim to when you anchor yourself? Magic Grog, the Magic Mike sequel. I did write it down at one point in time, but I'm not going to look for it right now. The badger? That's even better! Keyleth steps forward again, a little bit more, and says-- "Excuse me. Sorry. I just want to, I just, okay." I want to keep walking up to her as much as I can. Yes. While all this is happening, Keyleth is speaking to try and keep her attention. "You know, Raishan, you've taught me a lot about myself, these past few weeks; arguably more than I've learned about myself my entire years of living." Inspiration's a word I guess you could use. I would say more of a cautionary tale. In an odd way, I hope I never become you. All those years of long life That some many call a blessing. I'm sure there are many lonely moments, and I hope, in my darkest of times, I don't turn to rage and anger and selfish actions the way you did. That may be true. I see I have your attention after all. No. We... I mean, we know. (all laugh) Touche. You're correct. We reneged on our deal, just as you did on your end. There was a mutual distrust. We knew that from the beginning. It does. But, in terms of negotiation, you presented your deal, so we will now present ours. My want for revenge against you, while still strong and very palpable, I now understand was ultimately selfish only in the sense that everyone else in Tal'Dorei should share in the revelry of bringing you to justice. I am not the only one-- we are not the only ones-- who have felt the ramifications of your destructive actions. And as much as I would like to make do on my promise that I told you weeks ago, and end your life right now, I desperately want the rest of Tal'Dorei to feel that satisfaction as well. So. You surrender now, you come with us under means of temporary control, we take you back to Emon-- maybe the Fire Ashari; we'll work that out, we're going to take you and you face trial amongst the Tal'Dorei Council, the people of the Ashari, and on behalf of the rest of the citizens of Exandria. If you choose to not take this offer, then I guess we will see whose final resting place it will be in this cave. I mirror her. Puff up a little bit. That might be true, but at least that is the fate of our own consequences and our own doing, not some outwardly force forcing their repercussions on us. And you should know, Raishan, I've stepped on plenty of anthills in my day. Those that don't die revolt. And guess what? There are some pretty nasty stings from some ants out there. The strength of a colony is stronger than the individual of one great diseased foot. Nope. I guess we can say the same for yours. I guess it's a matter of who wins, now. I'm giving you one last shot. Surrender, and if you choose not to, at least we can go forward in our consciences and know that we gave you a choice. Is she a hologram? Is she an illusion? Wait. That's the dead body of Thordak, right? She's not possessing Thordak, is she? She's speaking through him-- Oh, undead, that's right. Lucky green, lucky green, come on! Ah, if it wasn't so ironic... (singing) On your wedding day! Thank god you guys are alive. Thank fuck. Four! I think that's you, because you're a fancy fighter. I was talking. I was giving a very compelling speech. Sunny side up. Did you add ten to yours just now? That's better! Yeah, that's her. It could still be her. He could've just not rolled high enough. We just made her leave. Yes, yes, get it. Get it! Bitch. But is it still dispelled? Yeah, I was just going to say, I've seen that. That's legit. Halloween Horror Nights is only fun when watching him. What up, paladin! There's advantages to both. (all laugh) Oh, hell yeah. Fuck yeah. Keyleth just says, "I've never seen a gardener do that." (all laugh) (laughs) Landscaper. Just exploded. They have only five hit points. We know this. Kitten damage. Destroy them? Just coming out-- Spawners. Total spawn location. She would totally do that. Okey-dokey. Whatcha doing? To get it to work? Is that like a stalactite? Interesting. Okay. Keyleth is going to move a couple closer to the wall, that's she's close-- Yes. Two. Forward a little bit, going towards this tunnel. Other way, other way. Right there's good, that's good. Thank you. He is literally-- yeah. Can I take my bonus action to do a perception check and see if I can sense any faint movements, fog being moved, pebbles being kicked? 21. I got you, bitch. All right. I want to do right overtop of Scanlan's fog cloud, I want to do Faerie Fire. Glitterbomb. Glitterbomb. Oh, man. I'm never going to Labyrinth again. She fucking counterspelled me. Or legendaried it away. She's in the fucking cloud, you guys. She's uploaded herself to the cloud. Look. Never forget your roots. Yeah, the cloud could get hacked. It's a Black Mirror episode all of a sudden. You ain't my guy, friend. Oh, fuck! Come on, come on, dragon sense and shit. Yeah! Because the illusion isn't considered a target? Big money, no whammies, come on. Shut up! Shut up. You badass! You badass! Do those arrows work like the spell? I know, I know. Oh, I think you have to beat her hit points. That's going to be tough. But she's diseased. And whatnot. Strength saving throws, hell yeah. Do you need d6s? I've got a line. Here's some d6s. One two-three. Here's all of them. Yeah. That's hot! How? Oh, jeez. She's switching form? HVAC. She's doing a Meteor Swarm. She's doing a Meteor Swarm! Hold onto your butts. Yeah, that's fair. One day, I'll have that spell. So you're unconscious, aren't you? No? So you have to pick an effect. Okay. That's good. 24. Okay, that's half. That's half. Nothing better. Don't you guys wish you were me? 54? 59? Okay. I'm at 57 hit points. 22, wow. Oh, come on. She still up? It has ten charges in it. You have to do over the damage you did. Fucking fuck. I'm so happy to see you! Kibbles and bits for you too? So the only people who've gone down are Allura and Kerrek? Okay. Silver lining. What? No! Yeah yeah yeah! Do the thing, do the thing. I love that song. How many does she have? Four per turn? Jeez. I know, right? Yeah. Can we just pretend that one was like a nat 20 for Pike? That would be the worst fucking phone call, Matt. 13. Is that the full damage, or did I-- I'm walking. Fuck. This isn't TV, this is the internet. The wild west. Allura's down again? Fucking-- Don't call it a comeback. Fuck! (nervous laughter) That's nice. Shut your fucking face right fucking now. Fuck me. Okay. Okay. Laser pointer, laser pointer. Just shut up, laser pointer. Anybody laser pointer! Who's-- shhh-- who's that? All right, fuck that water fountain! All right. Who's that? Okay. Keyleth is very not okay, comes around the corner, and I'm going to do, with my staff, and I'm going to pray to Melora and be like, "I know you hate this bitch as much as I do," and use my staff to do Firestorm right where I know she is. Just boof-boof-boof-boof-- I get to pick. All of that, all through this area, just that whole tunnel gets lit up. First? 7d10? Five... do you have two more? Reroll ones! Which I have one that I will reroll, and it's a one. Do I get to reroll it again? Fuck yeah. That's better. Nine... 12... Is it? Am I hot? I'm pale. I'm a redhead, so I show everything that happens. It's true. 17... Don't worry about it. I'm distracted. God damn it. Now I'm distracted out of my math. 17 plus four is 21, correct? Plus another five is 26 plus another four is 30, plus another four is 34. 34 damage. Did you get hit? Oh, that's right. She saved. Does it being a staff of Melora do anything? I'm going to-- can I see Pike? Okay, I'm going to reach around the corner and do a Healing Word. What, is it because I said "reach around"? Jesus! Everything I say. Everything I say. Level one. Because I'm pale and I just show everything. Nine. What's that? What's that? What'd you do? So she's spent two? Kill that resistance, kill that legendary resistance. Come on, Percy. Good turn, man, good turn. Yeah, life and death. Yeah, do it, do it. Do all you can. Come on, Scanlan. You did it with your shitty retort. We can see him getting beat the shit out of. Yeah, Grog! Yeah! Allura is bae! (all laugh) Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah, she's barely hanging on. She's got a single tear coming from her eye. Okay?! Is she still unconscious? I know, samesies. Okay. Hearing Allura's words and seeing Scanlan down, can I get a movement to where I can get over here and see her? Keep going, keep going. I can see her there? I'm assuming she's within 150 feet of me. This is kind of like a hail mary. Oh, jesus fuck. All right. I am going to cast... (laughs) my one 8th-level spell, and I'm going to attempt to Feeblemind her. Exactly. Exactly. Yes, which she's really good at, but we could get lucky. Shut up! Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! She can keep saving from it. We still have problems. And I just say, "Melora, come on, girl! Come on, Melora!" She can still attack. "Grog! Grog, get her down!" Is all I can scream before I just, my mind is blown. And then, panicking-- I do. Uh-huh. I'm going to go back towards Allura. Huh? (yells) Okay. I'm going to go-- Towards Allura, and heal the fuck out of myself. I going to do a-- Jesus, I can't speak. I'm going to do a third-level Cure Wounds on myself-- I'm sorry. I'm going to do. Oh right, it's a bonus action. I'm sorry. I will do a second-level Healing Word. Keyleth is at 28 hit points. He's whispering sweet nothings. Into her neck. Into her feeble mind. I got really excited and forgot to roll the damage that Feeblemind does. Which is 4d6 psychic damage. I just got real excited that it worked. I'm sorry. Okay. It'll be fine. The adrenaline-- I don't feel it right now. 4d6. 13 points of psychic damage. 13. She's just whaling on you. You're doing okay. It's like you and Thordak, man. Like a dog who just peed on the carpet. I am too. (all laugh) This is sad. This is sad. Heads up, seven up. Oh no, oh no. No no no no no. Towards dragon-dick? Natural 20? Well, I mean, that's still cool. Maybe, she might. Are you guys out of Revivifies? Matt gets weird about the minute rule. Just keep that in mind. I think the sooner you do it, the easier. Come on, Kerr-bear! Regular old evil. Classic evil. Oh my god, Kerrek! Holy shit! [BREAK] Sound off if you're alive. Percy. Same. Once. It works. It works. It's just enough. It's just enough. Oh, come on, come on. No? Scanlan's down. We have to get him out of here. Vax, the Raven Queen. You can talk to her, right? Vax? Okay. We have to get him out of here, because this place sucks. Um, okay. Question. Oh, you didn't kill anything, did you, Vex? There's no, like Fenthras-trees? There's no trees? That's fair. Okay, let's save our friend. No. What's wrong? Oh, fuck. We don't have-- Up and out. Up and out? Which doorway across the way? I run over to inspect it. Try and get us out of here. Perception? Oh, jesus fuck. Seven. Trapped or anything? Vax, can you check for traps? Are you fucking serious? Augh. I do my Stone Shape and I just punch the walls and try and blast a hole through the fallen rubble with Stone Shape. Is just a cave-in. Keyleth goes over to the corpse of Raishan. She takes the staff of Melora and shoves it down into her corpse. Just to see if any reaction happens. I just say, "That was for Scanlan from the Ashari. Bitch." What is he grabbing onto? Is he grabbing onto something? What was that? A symbol? You're going to burn it to the ground? I can help you with that. As we leave, we help burn this motherfucker to the ground. Avoiding all that stairs-trap stuff. Are these the fucking ghostrider skulls again? Are they all just like right down-- And we're kind of in a hallway, right? Yes. Yeah, they're immune to fire. We need radiant damage. Can I see them yet? I've got a Sunbeam ready to go. 60 foot. But I want to get them in a line. I'm going to line them up. I have a feeling there's a bunch of these guys. That's right. Five, six, need two more. d6s. (counting) 27 radiant damage. It's good. Fire Rays? I want that class. Allura, do you have any more teleportations left? Let's find a big ol' tree, then. I'll burn my seventh-level spell. We have to get to a living tree that we can all fit through. Do we want to go to Emon or anywhere else? Can you get us to Greyskull Keep, or at least the-- Pike and I have a little temple, yeah. If it doesn't work at Sarenrae's temple, I can use a treestride to get us elsewhere. Let's get to Greyskull Keep. What? Allura didn't vanish, did she? Do we follow or do something else? Kima! Can we do some sort of check? I don't either. (tearfully) Scanlan does. He would know. For Scanlan! (yells) Nothing. I don't know shit. I can get us there via tree. If we need to. There's a tree in Sarenrae's-- Who knows where they just got teleported to? Fuck. No no no. Yeah, we find a tree, we find a tree. I don't know. I can try to scry on them. I can try and scry on them and see, but that's going to take time. Can I scry while we're walking? Can I get a piggyback from Grog and scry while we're walking? Let's do it, let's do it. I'm going to cast-- I haven't burned any fifth-level spells, I'm going to scry. I'm really low. I'm just laying back on the carpet in a trust-state as they guide me. Just straight constitution? 15. No no no, 17. Plus five. Allura. Oh no. Oh no. Do I see any land, is there an island? I tell them what happened when I wake up. I don't even know where they could be. They're in the middle of the ocean, they could be right off the coast or hundreds of miles from here. This ocean... But they're our friends, are we just going to leave them behind? I mean. Keyleth starts hyperventilating, panicking a little bit. They're okay, right? Allura will figure it out, right? Okay. This is taking everything to not stay here. Okay. I do a useless scan of the ocean out of desperation to see if I see anything. Natural 20. It's true. It was a Gil dice, it was Gil's dice. You can see, you can see. 31. Perception's 11. There they are! Oh, shit-- I don't know if that's them, I think that's them! No, I know. I know, but look! Look! There's something. It could be something else, but it's something. I'm trying to give Vex over the earpiece like a, Warmer, warmer, warmer, colder, a little-- ten degrees to your left. I just keep saying, "Vex? Did you find them?" Vex? I'm just crying in Kerrek's shoulder right now, just bawling my eyes out. I swear I saw them, I swear. Still sobbing into Kerrek's shoulder. Oh god. So wait, maybe they were just dead and I saw their ghosts? What? And I just cry harder. Let's take a tree, shall we? I hold the door open like it's a closing elevator. Am I sure it's fucking Whitestone? Go! And I go in last. I cry to Kerr a little bit more. Okay, sorry. No, should we get him to the castle or the Raven Queen's temple? Okay, to the temple, to the temple. Okay. I use my-- oh jeez. I can't remember-- no, I didn't use any of my Scrying Eye on Raishan at all, right? That was my spell just now. I will use my Scrying Eye now to see if I can find Kaylie. That's cocked. That's not bad. Just a regular-- what do I use? Con saving throw? Then 16. Oh my god, oh my god. No, 16. She's in Kymal. Oh, I love her so much right now. Knowing how scrying works, and knowing that certain magic-casters can feel it-- This is going on a limb. I just yell through the scrying and audibly amongst everyone, "Kaylie! It's Scanlan!" Trying to push through the magical boundary and see if I can at least get a reaction out of her. And I scream again, "Kaylie!" God damn it, I wish you could talk to people through scrying sometimes. She's in Kymal. Allura might be able to send her a message. Allura, do you still have any messages left? Has she ever met Kaylie? I'm tapped out of teleportations. Tapped out of teleportation? In a tavern in Kymal. Yeah. I grab Grog on the outside of the temple, also standing outside, and I just grab him by his massive gigantic shoulder and say, You were closer to him than probably anyone else in this group, you knew more of his secrets than anyone else. I think it would mean something if you talked to him from beyond. His spirit still holds on. You can still speak to his spirit and convince it to come back. Convince it to come back, Grog. You knew him. You knew him. Look inside and you will know. And I crack the door to the temple open and try and gesture him in. You don't have to be religious. You had the connection with Scanlan, and you have heart. That connection speaks far stronger than any religion ever could. It's up to you. We don't know if Kaylie will make it. Well, I was talking to Grog. What about-- Oh jeez, I don't know his name. I mean, Reno's already pretty seedy, so. Sorry, Reno. Yeah he is, he's going to be so pissed. I so approve of this, by the way. This is the way to do this. Okay, byeeee. Sorry! (singing) My father wasn't around... Gah, it's going to be another Percy situation. Scanlan's going to be dead for a week. Schrodinger's Scanlan. Sam won't be here! Oh yeah, maybe he can Skype in. (whoops) Like, legit, we were all talking, we thought you were going to die. We thought you were going to be our Agent Coulson, yeah. Shoot for the moon, sometimes you'll land at the how do you want to do this. I had a few lucky rolls. Yeah, I was waiting for this. Keyleth will always be an awkward mess. As much character growth as you can have, you're still always you. She will always be awkward. I will always trip and fall and faceplant in lava.
