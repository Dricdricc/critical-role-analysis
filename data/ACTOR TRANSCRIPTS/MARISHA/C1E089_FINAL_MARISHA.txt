I think I just peed a little. Yeah. That's actually really gross-looking. At least it's a Mexico-- No, we're good. It's better. It's better. Don't choke. That made my eyes water and not in a good way. Do you wanna handle that? I have one while she swallows. Yeah, I'm concerned. That sounded like something that happens when you're diseased. This Saturday, it's the two-year anniversary of the twitch stream. (all cheer) Yes, isn't that nice? And pleasant? And not disgusting-looking? It's a 24-hour twitch stream. There's gonna be a lot going on. There's gonna be Gather Your Party, AXYB special, there's gonna be Game the Game, and we're going to-- Bearded Men, not Breaded Men. No, Bearded Men. And we are going to be playing Mansions of Madness, some of us, here. Like around one o'clock. Yeah. Yes. And the whole thing is gonna be charity-related, it's all gonna go to 826LA. Yeah. Yeah, so donate, we're gonna be taking donations, it's gonna be great. And he did our theme music. Yeah, it's very passive aggressive. Doctor Strange. Oh yeah, oh yeah, and his wife. And Doctor Strange. Yeah. Oh, no. Come on. Come on. We have to get him out of this environment. Come on. Yes. Before I do anything, I am going to throw up a Sky Write above the city. And it says, "Help. Cleric." That works. They'll get the idea. Hold on to him. Get on. I am going to turn into my giant raven form again. It's like the giant eagle form. I just kind of modify it for style. Yeah, yeah. Black feathers. All that coolness. Yeah. Yeah. A hundred percent. Gotta be on-message. I fly off towards the center of the city, towards where the entrance of the portal was, 'cause I'm assuming there would be sages and clerics waiting there. I know but there is like a-- I'll head there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's holding onto him and we're riding there. I drop my form. Do you have means of traveling quickly? We have a friend who is a cleric. Can you get us to her there and back quickly? Or someone who can Tree Stride me there and bring her back? I'm exhausted or else I would do it myself. Please? Please? Yeah, yeah. Any-- While she does this, I come over the earpiece and I say, Grog, Percy, quick, get back up to the central tower. Quick. I am trusting that they are. Oh thank god. Thank god. Is everyone still alive down there? Vax is down. So hurry. Pike. Pike, if you can hear me, we need you, now, in Vesrah. Please, it's Vax. Yeah? I second that statement. I don't want to wait too long. Let's just wait a little while longer and see if we hear anything from Pike. She's very smart. She'll hear us. While she does that, I start gathering the feathers and start laying them out as a bed around Vax, and preparing the station. She'll come. She'll come. I'm waiting for Pike. She'll come. Pike will come. But they're not good enough. Pike will come. Pike will come. I don't want to do this without Pike. She'll come. Where is it coming from? Is this normal? What's happening? Oh, thank Sarenrae. You heard. And I just run up and-- I was going to give her a hug, and then pat her astral form. I hug her. Can you still do some sort of resurrection? From here? How is this going to work with him and the Raven Queen? What do you know? Vex, do you know anything? Do you know anything, Pike? Okay. Okay. Speak to him. I'll go. I go up to him, and I prop up his back and set him up against my chest and whisper into his ear and say, I know you can hear me. I know you're still in there, and I'm sure she can hear me too, but your sister is right. You've held up to your promise, to her, and you've made a promise to me. We have to settle down and live happily together, remember? You promised me. Vesrah. So I want to give you a little bit of light to follow in the darkness. And I find the scar on his back of my handprint. And I find it and I cast Daylight into his back, into the hand print and say, and besides... You know I'm in love with you, right? (quietly) That's it. God damn it (sniffles) Which dice? Okay. 20 total. Yeah. (whispering) Come on, come on, come on. I don't care. And I don't. I just keep my hand-- come on, you have to be that hard? I was-- oh shit. Oh jesus. Oh, fucking hell. Oh jesus, come on. Yeah, you're not kidding, that's pretty intense. She did it again. Cotton candy Pike. Glad you're not dead. Really glad you're not dead. I feel like we all need to rest. I turn to Uvenda. Grog. Tary. The lodestones. Yeah. Good job, good job. Good work. Oh, that's happening tonight? Oh wow, this stuff moves fast, yeah For what? No. It was my negligence in proper planning that added to this. I think the landscape of the world has changed a lot recently, and I think the Aramente should reflect that. So I would be honored to provide any insight to help. What? What do you mean? Why were we the only ones with the tools? Recently. And none returned? I'm sorry. Yes, it is. Do you mind if we take a brief respite amongst ourselves, before we catch up with you and join in the festivities? Kaitiaki, Uvenda. Group hug, guys, group hug! Come here, Tary, you too. Oh, that's right, you did do that. Oh boy. Heal up a bit? In case. Yeah, are we all together? Ooh, yeah. Oh, yeah yeah, yeah! With a-- mm. I have something for you all. I have presents. Mm-hm. Well, I had Gilmore help me out with a little something for if and when I completed the Aramente, as a thank you, so I got them from him before we left-- granted, in hindsight, I'm never holding onto presents ever again, 'cause we could all just die any day. But! At least-- Yeah, like you do. But this time it worked out okay. And I pull out all the necklaces. These are from the dragons we've collected. They're dragon-tooth necklaces. And I had Gilmore enchant a very simple enchantment to each of them, so it won't-- you won't have to focus or attune to it-- -- if any one of us goes unconscience-- unconscious. If any one of us goes unconscious-- Thank you. The rest of them will start beating a little heartbeat. That way, we know if any one of us goes down, even if we can't see each other. So. Grog! Pike! And Vex! Yeah. I know-- Figure we all go unconscious so often-- Mm. Totally had this one made for Scanlan. Think I should hold onto it? But here's a flower! And I Druidcraft him a flower. I mean, you can-- do you wanna wear it for now? You know, maybe I should go ahead and just give this to Tary, I can always have Gilmore make another one. Here, Tary. Just... you did good. You did good here today. At least for now. I can probably have another made-- Oh, jeez. Oh. Okay-- thank you-- thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. That's-- Yeah, all right, thank-- you're welcome. Thank you. I think you're right. I can't take it back from him now. Or ever. I've been thinking about that a lot myself. Well, they don't really tell you much. Just tell you to go back-- go out into the world and prove yourself a leader, with no real definition on what they think a leader should be. That is one way you could phrase it, yes. Well, that'll be a discussion that I have with Korren, with my father. We're not barbaric! We're not-- no one wants to lose anyone on an Aramente. Do you think I'm not empathetic? Percy, do you not think that we have experienced ample amount of pain and loss over the course of this? It's not a blood sacrifice, it's a tradition, it's meant to show us the world, and yes it's flawed and I want to fix that. Ha. I don't think my traditions really vary that much from yours, which could still be perceived as old-fashioned, if you will? You know, it's interesting, Percy, I've always looked at you and I as that opposites-attract conundrum. As my best friend, I feel like you are always the natural born leader who has been running away from it ever since I met you, and I'm the one who's not as naturally gifted, but is racing towards it faster than-- Are you all right, Percy? (laughs) (laughs) (laughs) That was awesome! Yeah! I'm in my fancy clothes, by the way. Yeah, it's still a little soggy and damp. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on! Toss a drink, yeah. Right as rain. What's your definition of bohemian? Okay? I think of the goristro, Yenk. (screams) I turn into a beholder. (laughs) I am a golden god! (all laugh) I change into-- adult bronze dragon. I do a victory lap (whoosh). I turn and-- brass dragons have fire breath, right? Do they have fire breath? I do-- into the air, I just go (kwoosh) See what happens. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah! I come back down and I come down and I'm like (animal noises). Oh, that's right. I'm so used to Beast Shape! (all laugh) So I can talk? Hey guys! Guys, check it out! Ah, Ah. Yeah. I'm like, ah guys! Got little antlers. This is-- I don't know. You wanna go for a ride? Okay, all right. I pick up the half-elves. And Pike! Yes. And I totally spend the next hour giving joy-rides to anyone who wants to. Dragon rides. I leveled up. So that's Shapechange, right? I can change into anything that's a challenge rating of my level or lower. For an hour. Adult dragons are. Yeah. (sighs) I wasn't sure if I was ever gonna get here. (heavy sigh) Yeah I can. It's for an hour and I can keep shapechanging into different things for an hour. Yes, I can. It's like Beast Shape, so I keep my intellect, my wisdom, and my charisma, but I take on their physical stats-- -- and their abilities. Yep. I know! As the spell fades, I just give Grog a big hug and just kinda cry tears of joy into his chest for a little bit. Thank you. Truly. Thank you. I will keep her-- Thanks. That's all. That was a good party. That's true. I see Percy really quick. Are you still concerned? (laughs) Wouldn't be you-- I--if you weren't concerned. Wouldn't be here without you, or the others. You know that, right? I can't do this alone and I-- To answer your question from yesterday, I think the problem of this Aramente is that it shows you the components of what you need to be a leader, but being a leader could take a lifetime to master. If you even can master such a thing. So lots still to go, this isn't the end. And I hope you stay with me. I need you. Well, let's at least go home for now. Is that okay? Is that enough for now? I feel like once you can turn into a dragon, things only get more complicated. That's, yeah. All right, let's go. It's like a Kinder Egg. There's a toy inside. We totally called it. We're gathering up anyway. We're walking over. Don't fuck me, Gil. That's not bad. 23. Rolling with Gil. I'm not dreaming. I'm not dreaming. Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez. Yeah, higher, yeah. It hurts! Mama Pike. Yeah. (all laugh) (laughs) Von Muselix. An-swer. Yeah. Thank you for everything. I'm sure we'll be in contact soon. Kaitiyaki. I mean, I totally could Tree Stride us anywhere, but I kind of want to take the boat again. Yeah, we paid a lot, yeah. To Emon for now? We can go see. We also haven't looked at any of the findings from Raishan's cave. Well, let's at least get back to Emon, that's the main port town. It's a starting point. We're heading to Emon so we'll see you there, okay? No, no, no, she's okay. True. Just let him sleep, let him sleep it off. I-- if you're interested, Adella, because I'm feeling pretty spiffy after-- Okay, all right, I can control the winds and give us forwards-facing winds for a solid hour if you want. You want it? You want a little, turn this into a speed boat? You know? See how fast it goes? I don't know what this means, I've just seen other sailors do it so. Okay, I cast fifth-level Control Winds. I'm going to do just a solid gust behind us for a good hour. There's no need for an apology. Just, you being there means everything. That means a lot, coming from you, because I think you're just the coolest. I'm sorry if I ever put you or your brother in harm's way. Or anyone else. Well. Thank you. What now? Royalty's a strong word. Well, you're pretty cool yourself. All Grand Mistress Nightwatch. What's it called? Whatever. I'm glad I found you guys. Learned a lot from you, so thank you. She winked at me again. Now you can wear it. He spent the entire time on the boat braiding macrame, it was crazy. He's getting into beading, it's odd. (all laugh) No, it's great. To the keep? Do you have the papers with you that you pulled from Raishan? Are those with us? I'll help you research those. All right. Erwen! You're still alive! Yeah. Yeah, Gil! He's Hotis! Aw. He's too good for us. Yes, he's still alive. Yes! This is where we would have dinner. Oh! And that's a giant portrait of one of our members who you haven't met, he made it riding on a unicorn. It's great. You should show him the basement. I do a little gust cantrip to blow it. You want another title? Just give him another title. Yeah I'll do the reading for Percy until he gets his glasses back. We're reading papers from Raishan's. I speak Primordial. And, well. Primordial, Druidic, Sylvan, Elven. Grog stole his glasses, go easy on him. Don't say those things out loud. Did you detect any traps? Can I do Detect Magic on it? Sorry. Slash Raishan's. Yeah. What's your will, Pike? Your wisdom? Can I assist Pike in some way since we're both wise as fuck? My saving throw modifier is plus 11. -- and my regular modifier is plus six. I go up. I go up. I don't know, I don't know. This is what you tuned in for. Okay, all right, all right, if you wanna read it, I will go over your shoulder and be on the ready in case anything bad happens. It's true. Fall back into place? Why? What? Okay. Nothing weird. Just air, yeah, just a draft. You are the only ones who can speak Abyssal. Okay, all right-- -- hang on, hang on. Who wants to read it? I can-- I'll enhance your ability. Can I do anything-- I just eat the book! (laughs) Who's reading? Are you reading? I cast Enhance Ability on her and give her, I think it's Owl's Wisdom. (sneezes) We learned that. Yes, it could've. Huh? It gives you advantage on wisdom checks. Not saving throws. You all right? Can we have Doty copy down everything that you just said? Not actually exact transcriptions, just so we keep the knowledge. High school notes? That doesn't sit well with me. We don't here; we do in Whitestone. We were also going to go the Cobalt Reserve anyway, we could see, I'm sure they have some sort of a library special secret book vault. Re-lock it. I vote we take it to the Cobalt Reserve. Either that, or Vasselheim. One of the two will have options, I'm sure. Okay. Did we go through all of the papers that Raishan and everything had, for the most part? He mentioned going north and looking for other powerful entities and objects to bind with. And then Raishan thought it would be a good idea to settle down in Whitestone. She had an interest in Whitestone, which makes me wonder what the spinning black orb of death has to do with all of this. Because I'm still not convinced that it doesn't have some sort of play in everything. I'm just, you know-- What time is it? You all want to rest? Take the night off, head to Westruun in the morning? We are in the keep. You know, before we-- Brunch. Definitely Matt, Taliesin, and I, and maybe others? Yeah, I've been the Keeper a couple of times. A few, though. (rough voice) Oh, hell, yeah. Who can? Ashcan. Can you do the Skype-y things with us next week? Do you know? I'm allowed. Because I care. I know! No, no, Taliesin! Oh! I'm never eating Big League Chew again.
