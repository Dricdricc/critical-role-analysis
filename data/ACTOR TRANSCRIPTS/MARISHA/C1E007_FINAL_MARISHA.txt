Yes! Yes! Friends of the show, Espionage Cosmetics, hooked us all up with some awesome nerdy manicures. We'll tweet pictures of our nails, so yes, we're all wearing awesome nails and we're going to be doing a giveaway from Espionage. Their tabletop bath bombs, which are awesome d20s-- Oh, d10s-- No, there's a d20! There's a d10 and there's a percentile die! So yes, and we'll probably also go ahead and throw in a Critical Role signed picture as well with this. What you have to do is tweet @EspionageMakeup, is their twitter, @EspionageMakeup and #CriticalRole, and tell them what your favorite character is from Critical Role and who your favorite nail wraps are today and then we'll pick at half-time a winner. Your day is just getting started. Website went live, if you want to announce that now or later. 27! (gasps) Yes! Metal Gear Solid it! I'm a stealthy panther right now. (clears throat) I was gonna say, I'm still a cat form. But I can accompany you. It's a good day! I feel like it's gonna be a good day. That's a lot! This is why we don't have AI in the party, guys. You can't control the AI. I go ahead and move up next to Percy. Oh, but Grog's behind me. He's not here, right? Where's Grog? I'm a big kitty. Look, it's flashing! Can we do something to slow her down? Well, I mean, can we-- I mean, we don't wanna stop her I just wanna be like, hey, slow, girl. What?! Actually-- No, you go. Inside the loo. Here, I'm gonna-- I'll walk over, in tiger form, and I just grab one by the scruff and start dragging it. Wait, we kinda prop them up to kinda like Weekend at Bernie's them, yeah, make them just look like they're, you know, passed out. We take that one and kind of like lean him forward so you can't tell immediately. Apparently empty? Can I use my keen smell to see if I smell any duergar in there? Okay, I kinda-- even though I'm not a dog, I'm a cat, I still kinda point. I go into pointer face. You know? Like-- You know, like a pointer. Gotta love that nat 17. I'm going to snoop in the barracks. Oh shit! I'm going to stay actually right there, just right at the threshold. It's apparating poo. Ha-ha. Run, Tiberius! Can I do a combo move with Grog, assuming that he would agree with me that it's gonna be super cool? Okay. (laughs) Thanks, Grog! So since Grog's kind of there-- Can we arrange like a fastball special, almost? So have him like kind of go up and crouch and I'm gonna bust out-- He-- with-- Well, is Grog in my way? I was wanting to vault off Grog's back, is what I was wanting to do. Yeah, that's what I was going to do. No, you asked how I was communicating it. So I'm gonna come out and I'm gonna vault off his back and try and do a pounce over top of Tiberius for that duergar that's closest to you. What am I rolling? Acrobatics? Is this an acrobatics thing? 11. Uh-huh. Okay. That's fine. Oh, can I not attack? Okay, okay, okay. I'm gonna go ahead and do my bite attack. I'm gonna go right for his throat. Still with the same intention that I had in mind. Okay, 17. 1d10 plus five. Where's my d10s? Ten damage. Piercing damage. (meows) It's a narrow hallway. So once again I grab him by the scruff, take him, and put him in the bathroom. Oh, yeah, did I find anything in the barracks? I'm burying my shame, again. Burying the duergar. Well, I guess I'll go after I bury duergar. We will be Team Outside Posse. Oh, shit! Intelligence. Every turn they have to try and break out of it? It keeps going? It's like a keep-going thing? Son of a bitch. Surprise round. 'Cause they got the drop on us Oh, oh, wait, 13. (laughter) Thinking about life and death. (laughs) Kima, get it girl, get it, get it girl. (gasps) There's a big chandelier. That's fun. Wait, there's another one? There's two? Fantasy math. Once again, 826LA, after-school tutoring. Good charity. Smashy smashy. Damn it! That's not good. They really know we're here. As quickly as possible. I'm going to go ahead and dart down this hall that we know is for sure empty. And what's in this room? I'm looking over here. Percy and I are checking this room with the double doors. Do you have any trap checks to see if it's locked? Yeah, anything in there? No cool goodies? We can do that. Yeah, go for it. I'll go ahead and very-- I'm just gonna kinda use my keen sense-- or sorry, my keen smell again to see if I can smell any duergar in the area. That's pretty good. Oh yeah, I'll take that first roll, which was seven-- 27. A strong, lingering scent? But probably not present. Whatever. I guess we'll see what's in here. Peeky, peeky. Parkour, parkour! Hm. I'm gonna-- oh wait, I'm a tiger. That's what I was gonna do, is tell somebody to get Pike over here real quick. She's coming! I can hear her coming. No! Look and see if there's anything cool, first. What was that thing that's covered up by the blanket on the altar? Yeah. What's up with that? I get up and I grab it in my mouth. And then I walk over to Vax and I lay it at his feet. I kind of nudge it with my nose. Agreed. Same here. So vicious. Damn. And who said that words couldn't hurt people? Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can hurt. Maze? Kill him. This might be a good time to stop for a moment. That's cool. Oh, don't open that. Who knows how long those guards had to be staked out here? Don't open that. Can we talk about what this duergar just told us? Oh, and this is your last chance because after the break we'll pick a winner for the Espionage giveaway. So, last chance if you want to tweet @EspionageMakeup and #CriticalRole and look at our sweet nails! They're awesome. They're cool. Yes! Our winner for the Espionage Bath Bombs Tabletop from @espionagemakeup goes to (drumroll) Danny Carr. Who is @Eleine35. So, Danny, I'm pretty sure you follow me on Twitter, just PM me your address and I'll get these out to you. And thank you! Oh, I have to follow-- Oh, well then I'll follow Danny right now. Very limited, like once they're gone, they're gone. It's true. So, it's www.critrole.com, and, yeah, and the site is still under construction, so. But we managed to rush it out, and I wanna give a huge shout-out to Michael Whitesman, who's a big friend of ours, for helping us make the website @whitesly, if you want to bug him, and, yeah, so, if you buy-- Whitesly! His last name is Whitesly. Anyways. Anyways, you can go buy t-shirts now, which was the whole point of that. At critrole.com. And there's a limited run. Once they're gone, they're gone. Yeah. We're doing this all ourselves just to, just 'cause-- See how this works. You guys-- Yes, this was, we got this from @rusegafdi. He wore this at Tabletop Day, so-- Yeah, so we're-- we decided we're going to do, like, fan-designed t-shirts. So, once every so often, we'll do a fan-designed t-shirt, and yes. And then-- but they'll all be limited, so yeah! T-shirts are sold out! Holy shit! We didn't know! We didn't know! I'm sorry! Now I almost feel guilty. Congratulations to the 100 people who got 'em. I don't know what to say! Oh god, I'm like, going to cry. Oh my god, I'm like, shaking. (laughs) We didn't know if people liked our show or not! Okay. Wait, what are we gonna do, 'cause here's-- there's an army waiting upstairs for us? I'm gonna hop out of tiger form, by the way, since we rested and stuff. You're not going to kill another pony, are you? Good. Ah! That's actually a really good idea. So we're basically gonna be like three kids Little Rascals-style on each other's shoulders with a giant coat? Okay, well then, why don't-- I actually like this idea. Why don't we have a few of our stealthy members, why don't we have the twins be in the shadows, and picking people off while-- Right, why don't we have some of our ranged people-- I'll transform. I can transform into-- how about a giant scorpion? That sounds fun. I can transform into beasts. They have to be beasts. I can be a rhinoceros-- I can be, like-- Can I do dinosaurs? I can be a dinosaur, right? That's a new thing I can be, right? Well here's, oh wait wait, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, hang on, hang on, hang on, this might be crazy-- wonder what would happen if I drank that weird yellowish potion? While I'm a monster? But I'm wondering if you can, like, if I can transform into a monster and then you with Polymorph can maybe just transform. You don't have to snap at me. Oh, thank you. I mean. But you don't know what he looks like. Well. that's not K'varn though. So wait, so wait, are you going to be their god, and I'm still going to also be a crazy monster, as like your pet crazy monster, with our stealthy team, or just-- Ooh! You'll be like Xerxes. Some theatrics. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on the party. Everyone stay close. Well, all of us, all of us I guess, until we get upstairs. We all have Pass Without a Trace as long as you stand close enough. We got this. We got this. It's been a good day. What are you going to say? Are you thinking about this? Think about something. Start thinking about this now. Laduguer. Are you gonna try to Lightning Bolt an entire line? I do know it right now. Scanlan, can you and I focus our Call Lightning spells together? To Lightning these-- You have plus ten because of my Pass Without a Trace. This is gonna be cool, this is gonna be cool. It's gonna put them all in one spot. No, now we can electrocute them and they're wet! Lightning Bolt! Do I get any more damage because of the-- So 5d10? Do I roll for each one? Oh, and they're at a disadvantage? All right. Nice. Not too shabby. So we have ten, 19 plus 18, bringing it to 28 plus three, 31 plus one. 32. Scanlan, go! 32, total. (laughs) What a terrible way to die. I say-- I go, get on my back, get on my back, and I piggyback him. Well I'm piggybacking him, just now. I'm literally just piggybacking Tiberius waiting. Oh, oh, Pike Pike Pike Pike Pike. What kind of animal would this god use? Would you know what kind of animal the duergar would worship? Do you know? What kind of animals he might like? You know, check out-- you know, animals. I guess a scorpion, a scorpion sounds good? Scorpion. Giant Scorpion. Back him up. Back him up. Oh, are we busting in? Fuck if I know. Giant scorpion. Athletics. Plus my dex, I'm assuming? Strength, that's pretty cool, though. 22. I rolled a 19. So just keep focusing on your Light. Maybe do some Prestidigitation where you move shit around. Oh! Hello, everybody. LIAM and Oh, that's right, they have those pet basilisks. Remember? Get it. Get it. Get it. I know! I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. 8d6. Oh, god damn. Come on, you got this. You got this, Vax. Uncanny Dodge? Sneaky sneaky. I'm nine. (laughs) Big number five. I just noticed your shirt. It's really great. Feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. Nothing we can't handle. Oh sweet, sweet dice rolls. Let it rain d6s from the sky! Natural 20. Playtime? I don't-- (laughs) I know, all the ladies are like 'ew'. You're on top of me. I'm holding you! Okay, well, we have all these twos. Let's put the twos side by side. That's fun. Uh-huh. Contest of wills, staring contest, staring contest! That's right, he does. All right. I'm going to go right for the king. You're coming for a ride, Tiberius. I'm gonna make a straight line. I have a 40-foot movement, pretty straight movement. Okay, I'm in melee, yeah? All right, I'm gonna do my full three multi-attack. Okay. Okay, first one, probably not gonna hit. 12? Second one. 16? Tail strike. Two. Ten. Nothing. God, you're so heavy, Tiberius, god! My balance is wonky. Get your heal on. Oh, that was a pretty one. 12 points? He crit? No crits for you! Crit happens, whether you're here or not. (sings) All that doubles is gold. Ooh! That's hot. Oh no! Not again! Oh shit! Do you have water? Okay, okay, okay. I come out of the form. Yes, thank you. I'm going to take Wind Wall. I'm gonna cast Wind Wall and try and wrap it around the lava column and try and contain it within the Wind Wall, cooling it down. Essentially making a tornado-like vortex around the lava. Okay. 18. This isn't gonna hold for long! Somebody rub some blood on Tiberius, quick, and let's get the hell out of here! I'm just holding this. Will someone collect some blood? Do we want to kill the king? Do we need somebody alive to help us? Could be worse. You could roll a 20. We said he could roll a 20! We called it! Who called it? We called it. Kill him, kill him! This is the second time we've lost Grog. Can we-- where's the magic carpet? Throw their asses on the magic carpet! Oh, can we get the magic carpet now? I go ahead and on our way out I cast Create Water, and I kinda just use my air ability and make a mist to try and like mist the lava that's coming towards us. 20. It's a big stone door? I just cast Stone Shape and make a hole. Sorry, Vax. I didn't mean to, like, overstep there. I did create a wall over top. It was permanent! I can. Yeah. Do it again. Bam. "You made nothing." Seven. 18 points? Okay, wait wait wait, can I take my stone wall and like, close it off? We're all out, right? Stone Shape? I'm just-- I'm just taking it away. I'm closing it. I can do it again, I still have two more spell slots. Three. One, so far. I know. I was an animal all week-- all last game. I didn't use any last game. I used one Stone Wall last week and I have two level five spells now. I know. C'mon, Pike! Sort of. Yeah, you should have-- you need, like, a sweet pimp swagger now. Yeah, or maybe, like, you know, a black ooze. You wanna do that? Yes! Was it the Duganator's birthday? (sings) Happy happy birthday, from all of us to you. We wish it was our birthdays, so... we're partying. Yay, woohoo! (laughs) Yeah, way to not use the copywritten one, yeah. Thank you guys, we love it, cupcakes! Happy birthday. Thank you, guys. CrazyNexy. It does. It helps a lot. Almostheaven? More like totally heaven. Always heaven. Thanks Warmcustard! (laughter) I know I'm getting more now, muzzbuzz. That's a good movie! We like the karma! Thanks Frisbee! You are the least we can do to entertain ourselves. Wait, what?! FicklePicketickler, that's great. Thank you guys so much! You are all amazing, I love you so much.
