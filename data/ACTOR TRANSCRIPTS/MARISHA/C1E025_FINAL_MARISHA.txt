I'm sitting on his unicorn stomach. So thanks, post-nuclear family. Yeah, it's technically an ice bucket. Yes. That's so smart. Fuck! Sounds like Blight or something. Oh ho! They're sucking the life out of you. (whispering) Jenga! What's going on? I'm going to go eagle, and I start scouting the halls looking for him. I'm heading to wherever I saw the Briarwoods taking off whenever they were leaving. No, you're big. I can take the gnomes. I poop on one of them as I go over. It's one of the Briarwoods' servants, right? Oh, no. I want to save it for if I fly over one of the Briarwoods. Never mind. It's fine. (caws) That's me saying sorry. Is the door open? That's okay. Thanks, Percy. Ten. Yes. Life lessons by Critical Role. So that means he never got his "I'm right here" message out. Well, he's not in the room. He's in the front yard, at this point. So we are heading to the room. That's right, it's dark outside. We'll see, I guess. Oh, I'm really sorry I pooped on you! I didn't know I was shitting on you! I'm going to go double my speed. My fly speed is 80 feet right now. I'm going to head towards and pick up Scanlan. Dexterity saving throw, you said? As my eagle form, right? 12? You've seen me turn into an eagle. An athletics check with my eagle. Is that dex or strength? 19. Every little bit counts. 30 feet. I can take you over there. I'm trying to give you a fast way down, motherfucker. What are you looking for? Bring it back to Sam. But Matt, she's our guest! Nothing travels faster. These are the worst people we've ever faced. d12s? 12, 12 away. Yes! Wait, I didn't get my turn? Okay, I'm going to fly out the window with Scanlan. The broken one. I'm going to go ahead and drop him off. So Seeker Asum, he's against us? But he just fired at Grog. Oh, I didn't see that. Do I still have enough movement to make an action? Where's Lord Briarwood? I'm going to go and try and peck his eyes out. Yeah, I dropped you off, I'm going to go and swoop over-- That's what I was asking. Yeah, you know what, I'll drop eagle form. And I will also use my bonus action to cast Healing Word on Vax. And I will also cast it at-- actually, I'll cast it at a 3rd level because I want to be safe. Thank you. Oh, and it's plus my spell modifier? Is that what it is? Plus ten, so yeah, I need one more, so that's 17 points. Oh no, wait. No, 15. Sorry. These fuckers, I'm so angry at them. Hold on. (laughs) I think distance makes a difference with these people. I can fix it. It's okay; don't worry about it right now. I can't fix it right now! I can fix it. I can fix it after I sleep. Just not right now! Thanks. I get a d10 right? Ha! Okay. What is that?! That sounds awesome. Percy! Sylas? My turn? Okay. Wait, where did Briarwood go? Lord Briarwood. TALIESIN and Oh, he backed up. Beautiful. So I take my staff and I crack it on the ground. Where I cracked it, little ice crystals start forming against the ground and start making ice and I'm going to cast Sleet Storm. I need a thing. No I need a-- A laser pointer! There you go. So it's a 40-foot radius. Starting where Briarwood is. Right. Starting in this line. Grog's not in it. From here back. So the ground in the area is difficult terrain. It is covered with slick ice. When a creature enters the spell's area for a first time or on its turn starts its turn there, it must make a dexterity saving throw or else it's knocked prone, because they slip and fall. If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area the creature must make a successful concentration saving throw against your spell's DC or lose concentration. And then I move back. She's got to make a dex throw. It just says they just have to make a dexterity saving throw or they're knocked prone. Oh, is it? 18. No, they're going to bamf! They Dimension Doored out. I can probably teleport us through a tree, right? How, roughly, far away are they? I still have my Sleet Storm up. It's a concentration spell. I'm going to move it over there. Yeah. It's a concentration spell. It lasts a minute. Well, then I cast it again. 150 feet. And it's rough terrain? Have you guys seen them? They're awesome. It's been one of the most emotional nights of my life. Do we see him go find her? Okay. Wait, we can put him in our cell. We'll bring him to Greyskull Keep. He's fine. He's not bleeding. It was non-lethal damage, right; he's not bleeding out. All right, I'll solder up his wounds a bit, make sure he doesn't die. Also, you're a common guard. I'm speaking because Tiberius would say this, and he's not here right now because he's a little stupid at the moment, but do not interfere with the businesses that we have already arranged with people who have higher authority than you. Back off. Oh, I'm not good at this shit. I'm going to train in it. It's coming. I also still have Scanlan's. I'm going to add my Scanlan. 15. No, we'll call you. The universal symbol for I'm choking. Can I do a health check on him? 18. What time of day is it? Would the Sarenrae temple still be open? It's a church. They're 24 hours, right? Lillith? That's so pretty. Let's just keep listing words, guys. Lift! Where are you from? Your accent's so-- Oh, right, yeah. Are you all right? Are you with the Briarwoods? Well look, we've got to make a pit stop at the temple of Sarenrae, anyway. Why don't you at least join us, and then we can at least go back to Greyskull keep for dinner, because we also have to drag this prisoner back there. It's along the way. And Tiberius is-- He's an idiot. I don't know where he's an idiot right now. Damn it, we lost Tiberius. You invited them in. Yes. Look, she is traumatized. We'll talk to him in the morning. We got to go. I turn into a horse and pick up Vax and Vex and take them to Sarenrae's temple. He used to be a very intelligent sorcerer. This is part of the problem. Could there be side effects or something? Ooh, do I recognize what herbs he's using? Nature check? 19, so 29. Excuse me? Do you actually have any extra of that glissfoil or any seeds that I could take with me? That way I can just keep up on his daily disinfection. Thank you so much. Yes, do you remember her? Tell them Vox Machina sent you! Yeah, actually, while we walk back to Greyskull, what happened? It would have been true 30 minutes ago. They said your family was still there. How do you spell that? We had a code word. And don't we have a prisoner? Yes, and we still haven't found what the Broker-- who he is, or what he is. I'm pretty sure we would have to have an enchantment on our keep that would guard against scrying. I go ahead and crack my staff on the ground and cast Anti-life Shell. Get close to me! Get close-- what? Did I? But that's a spell I cast on myself. The closer to me you are, the more you'll be guarded by the shell. You can still fight around it. They just can't get in. 11. 11. Bringing up the rears. Anyone within ten feet of me. A decent amount right now. Not Tiberius, not Scanlan. Nothing aside from undead and constructs can get into it. You can still cast spells, and fire bows, and you can still do stuff. We can go out, they just can't get in. Do you mean 6th-level? That's awesome. She will wake up. Unless you cleave her in half, she will wake up. He runs, he runs smack-dab into my wall. My arcane-- Blocks living things. They can't come in. Like vampires. Yeah. What is wrong with you? But that was awesome. That was pretty dope. And advantage. With advantage and a d6. Upon seeing Percy go absolutely insane and screaming "your soul is now forfeit," out of shock, my Anti-Life Shell dissipates, and I spend my action staring at him. You've got asshole. This is becoming a Monty Python sketch. We're focusing so much on this poor old woman and there's big intimidating-- 5d4 times two plus five? We are being sadistic today. Oh you just elbowed me. Yes, right in the funny bone. Plus-one Wand of the War Mage. Shall we throw him in the pen with the other guy? Your purpose in life is only what you make of it. And what was the name of your homeland again? It sounded very exotic. We all have those. Lillith, would you like to stay the night before you move on? Please, have dinner with us. And I go in the back into the garden, and I take the glissfoil out of my pocket that I was given, and I revive it from its dried state that it was given to me in, and plant it in the ground. What's your twitter? That is so cool. I was on the verge of bawling my eyes out.
