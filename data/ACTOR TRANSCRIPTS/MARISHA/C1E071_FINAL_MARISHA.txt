It is on your body. Go sit in the corner with it for 30 minutes. Taliesin, you work in film and TV. You know how this works! Get behind where we are. Yay! Must keep it going! I know, I think you've aged through the process. So sweet. That might be my favorite one. That might be my favorite one you've done. That was good. Boston. You're not sure. Oh yes! We're doing a Halloween special edition. Two runs, starting Tuesday, and we're bringing back all the hosts! Taliesin and I are the first episode, and I know you guys love us, so for everyone who's like, "I'm not watching anymore because Taliesin's not the host anymore!" Now you should watch again. You're good at the spooky stuff. You basically built our list. It was amazing. It's all good stuff. We don't sleep? Percy, how are you feeling? You know, he seems all right. A little pale. I feel like time is of the essence here. Probably not best to wait until morning. Look, she already hates us. Are we? (groans) We can maybe try and get Pike. Gives us an extra day for Pike. I can go get her, theoretically, if we have an extra day. She does have the stone, right? She does have the stone? I think she has the stone. Okay. Well, we don't want to necessarily have them jump in right away. We want them to set Vorugal on Yenk, correct? Glorified messengers at this point. The goristro. Oh, that's unfortunate. Two Grogs? Is it like two Grogs? I can't. He can. So you're telling them? Are we going to go back and see them again? Okay, we'll just say next morning, then you go say, "hey, we got an awesome thing for you." Okay. Well, they gave us a location of the stones. Sure! Of course! (giggles) You can trust me. I do! I was the last one, you guys! It feels-- doesn't really feel like anything. Sure. I switch hands. (laughter) I mean I could do what I did before and follow you as Minxie. Worked last time. I still have my one last shape, as well. It's a mountain-based tiger. I'm a white snow tiger. It's actually very cold in the mountains. That's why they have thick coats. Who, me? He didn't see me before. Let me see something. Hang on, because this'll tell me because Polymorph-- you might go out of my range. Is the only problem. Range is 60 feet. Okay. Can I? He can go. Do you want to go? All right. What do you want to be? It's true. Sure! I don't see why not. I do that. With one yellow eye and one black eye. To match Vex, I give him one little blue feather, just off the side. Little blue streak. So tangled. An hour. I think it's an hour. While they were gone, I, with Fenthras and Whisper, was playing make-believe archer Vex, like a 12-year-old in the bedroom with a Nerf bow. It worked! How did it go, guys? It might be like a cool combo move. I can try and scry. That I can do, yeah. We did, but if I burn a higher-level spell, then yeah. What does it matter, at this point? All right. I'll be right back. See you guys in a minute. A minute passes. This is like when you walk the same direction, you say bye, and then you walk the same direction to the car. I like your jacket! It's really great. Were you sleeping? This is so awkward! Oh my gosh. You know, I never thought about having poor timing with these gate stones. I'm so sorry! I thought you were on the toilet. Yeah, me too. I missed you. Yeah, but it seems like I went around the world and back! Yeah, we got all the way there and we were like, "oh, we forgot Pike!" Do you want to go? We can go now. All right. Okay. So we Tree Stride back. Right. So yeah, so the leader of Ravenites, her name is Tooma, and we went there, and we were talking to her, and I think we have a plan, but not really a plan, so we're going to figure it out as we go. All right? Let's go. That's the plan; you're caught up. (whispers) Let's be quiet, okay? Let's do this. We stealth there. Oh, that's a natural one. No! Oh my god, Pike. The plan hasn't even started! Pike? I don't move, either. Do we not move or do we run? Run! (laughter) I cast Grasping Vine to grab onto her. Go! Go, run! Dragon might know we're here. Well, there might've been a rockslide. And it might've been our fault. I'm not sure. I don't know, Grog! They can see a shimmering door. I'm assuming that was Vorugal. Big white. Big dummy dragon. At the pace in which that cliff fell apart last night, I don't know about the structure of the topography here. I can try and do a Commune With Nature and see. I'll have to think on the caves. Honestly, I'm not going to know a whole lot until we scout out the location. I've got something I've never done before! Almost. It's called Animal Shapes. And it's basically Polymorph, but for all of us. I can turn us all into whatever we want. We are cows. It's almost debatable. Because we look like an unnatural mist. We can be misty animals? That's dumb. (laughter) We always keep our intellect. Animal Shapes last for 24 hours. I'm going to find that out right now. Because if we were a flock of birds, Vorugal's not going to give a shit about birds. That is awesome. So anyway. Back to the plan-- (laughter) I'm so excited. All right. Thank you for your validation. I imagine it depends on how scouting goes. All right, let's go scout. I cast Wind Walk on everybody. Do you want to come scout? We're going to scout. Or you can just stay. It's mainly filled with chicken. And there's the spa under that. It's okay. It's more for appearance. I want to go to the summoning stone. I'm going towards there. Sure. I follow the crowd. Do we get some sort of bonus because we're mist? Jesus. Stealth and what? 14. (laughs) I can save them! I can save them all! (giggles) My friends. Yeah, I'll watch as they do that. I'm going to mist down next to them. Hey, guys. What are we talking about? (laughs) God, so windy tonight. All right, well, here's the problem. I need to figure out what all of this is made out of. I can't work with it if it's just ice. It has to be natural stone. So cover for me? I'm going to drop down and start meditating. I'm going to do a Commune With Nature spell. Do we have any other questions, before I do this, that we want to ask the land? In general, I guess. Do I need to figure out how far exactly Vorugal is from us? I have three good questions. No, it's not. The weather forecast. Nature-y things. I can ask it about-- Yeah. Is there a Starbucks nearby? Oh, I was asking-- yeah. I can ask it about topography, I can ask about locations of people nearby. Things like that. Oh, that's a good idea. Where the fuck is Raishan? Okay. She might be. Okay. Now I do this. First and foremost, what is the geological makeup of this land around me? This ravine. Cliffside. What is it made out of, yeah. And all of this stuff on the edges? So it is fairly sturdy and not apparently going to collapse at any moment? Sure. Okay. Can I get a sense on what the weather is going to be like for the next 24 hours? Bummer. Okay. Good to know. And do I sense Raishan? Bummer. She's within three miles. Well, no, he's said another, aside from Thordak. Okay. That's it. Those are my three questions. Close to the ruins of Draconia? And not where the library and the ruins of Draconia were. And do we want them to connect so we can get through? Little half loops, semi-circles? I'm pushing out earth. Yeah. Vex and I mentioned that. How loud will this be? Yeah, but it's only a foot of ice. We could do a test. I could make walls of stone. I can make little-- But also keep in mind, anything that I do, he'll notice. And the whole point to this is to not make our presence known at all. So we could pop in our tunnels and they could be like, "what's up?" On the other end of the ravine? Well, you're still mist-form. That lasts for eight hours. You can mist back. The mansion's considered a pocket plane. Oh, away from us? He's going west. (gasps) Does this mean we can dig? What do you guys think, should I do it? Over the earpiece. I guess I'm making tunnels. Yeah. I can melt ice. I can make some more plant life. No. Cool. But how long does Stone Shape last? I thought it was just for a little bit. I know, but how much? It's only like a five foot cube, right? So I can't make a tunnel. Right, so no. I can make a little trench, like a trench wall-line for you guys at the top of the ravine, for the shooters. Yes, exactly. Right along the ledge. So yeah, I'm going to do Wall of Stone. Fuck. Yeah, I basically want a little almost half wall for cover here and here, just extending the stonework. Upwards. So that they can-- Do the Gears of War. You know what, let me flank it. Let me do one on that side and one over here. Yeah? You think? Is this excessive? I guess I could, actually, because I can do a flat one. Okay. All right. You know what, I could make little pod bubbles for you guys on the half edge of the cliffs. I'll do that. Yeah, if we try and camouflage it. Spend the rest of the day camouflaging it. The DM keeps looking at us like we're crazy. All right. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to make (stammers) little balconies. (giggles) So smooth. Yeah, little balcony ledges that they can go on. Yeah, little ledge. Yeah, a balcony. I want to make a cliff balcony. One there, and one-- yeah. And about what, 40 feet up? 50 feet up? How about halfway up the mountain? I want to make it look rough, I want to try and camouflage it, and then I'm also going to help Percy and the rest of this excavation to use my Gust and little Create Water spells over top of it to start covering them with ice. Yeah, cover it with ice to make it look like the rest. He normally only asks me that when we're making a terrible plan. Check out the big brains on Brad! 23. Oh, he let us do it! He was heading west, right? Raishan was south. She was far south. Yes. I kick Scanlan a little bit. Larkin, was it? She's good. I kick Scanlan again, for sheer joy this time. Larkin. Should we have someone near where the dragon is, so we can get eyes? Watching? Yeah, because the earrings don't work through the mansion, right? Well, the mansion could be good if things go terribly wrong. She came in the mansion with us? Oh, you haven't done it yet. Never mind. Can I get like a glimpse of it before I run in on what it is? 27. Damn it! So it went hunting. Good idea. Who's going to keep an eye on Larkin? I knew the second she walked up! Hang on, we weren't done. We weren't done. We have to do things. We have to eat. We have to do the Heroes' Feast, for sure. Saves on wisdom throws. Also plus 2d10. And I think that's it. That's right. Fuck you Raishan. An additional 11 to Keyleth. You got two tens?! And are we sure we don't want eyes on her? I'm not concerned about her well-being, clearly. I'm concerned on whatever her name she's saying she is right now. Okay. Can I ask a logistical question? How wide and alive are those trees? So Tree Stride probably wouldn't work on these guys. I'm wondering if I should waste my time. All right. Snow camouflage. I do. Yep, I do. I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on your charisma. An hour. So if we're ready to go? Yep. Do they appear to be Ravenites? Vex, you want to talk to them? They might have told him. Might have been the ones that just told him. We're ready whenever you are. I can't do that. You keep forgetting that's you who can do that. No. No, it takes an action to cast. I think I just peed a little. I'm going to go ahead and wait until the 15-minute mark-- no, I'm going to wait until the ten-minute mark and then Enhance Ability on Scanlan. I cast Enhance Ability on Scanlan. Charisma. And then I am going to move. We don't have anyone over here yet, really, correct? All right, I'm going to-- fuck. Hide behind the tree and stealth as much as I can. I can be an animal if you feel like you want eyes out here, as well, but I won't be able to go elemental. Until I rest. All right, I go in the mansion. Remember to be super direct with his name. Here, let me give you the script. You have advantage on charisma checks. Every little bit helps. Oh god! That was the coolest thing you've ever done! I've been waiting for this all week! Just dies instantly. Oh fuck. Apparently white dragons are its weakness. Yeah, he's burned two of his legendary actions already. Yeah, we're watching the dragon burn through his legendary actions. So we know they're here. I can ground him. I'm just throwing it out there. I can ground him. It's time to go. We're about to pop out. Yenk is on top? Isn't Percy halfway down? Thanks, Pike! Should we pop out? Should we do this? What's it looking like, Scanlan? I can try and ground him. It's a strength saving throw, though; it's going to be tough. I say, excuse me, Scanlan. Son of a fuck! Four. Did he lose his save against it? We should still try to stay out of all this. You're my favorite. That's her turn? What are you good for? Remember, she learned from the druids a bunch of fucking nature shit. Man, how awesome would this be? (excited gasping) Shut the fuck up! She has to roll under her level, which she did. Shut the fuck up, Ashley! Yes! Holy fuck! Pike! That was amazing! You've gotten close. You've gotten really close. Okay. Oh god. I'm going to pop out of the mansion. I was expecting to do an Earthbind spell, but that's not necessary. That's okay! I'm going to fuck this guy up while he's down. I'm going to peek around the corner, going towards you a bit, and seeing everyone there and all this go down, I'm going to Fire Storm the fuck out of this! I have ten of these? I'm shaking. Yeah, that's what I want. I know. I want it. 7d10. I'll roll this one. It's eight! Okay, hang on. (counting) 30. I picked it up. 38. I'm going to use the last bit of my movement to pop back behind the stone. Can't say we're not honest. The cloak doesn't have anything to do with this, right? With advantage? Natural 20! I thought you said advantage. Fucking fuck! Well, then I guess I reroll. I should have kept the first one. That's an 18, which is good! 23. That's 36? Can you grapple him? Grapple a wing? She crossed you? He's a dick to her, and now he's angry about it. It's becoming a Jenga mini-game. Okay. I am going to cast Earthbind on him. 300 feet. (frustrated noise) I am going to do a bonus action to cast Healing Word on myself. Heal myself real quick. Same thing, I want to scoot back a little bit, behind that tree, a bit. Yeah, because I got whacked with that ice breath, and I don't want that to happen again. All right. You try to unjam it? You're mad-dogging the dragon? Where is Yenk? Is she going to go for him? Heroes' Feast, man. Don't eviscerate him. It's fine. It's not going anywhere. It does look like he's copping a feel. No, this is our fantasy land, man. Jesus, he's back for my shit. He's back for me and you, Pike. Okay. 18. I'm at 36. Luckily I also healed myself up. This isn't good. I'm up, but Pike isn't, correct? I'm not. Pike is. There is an exit door. We can literally toss Pike's ass in the door. How many are you down, Pike? And those were all great weapon master? That's fucking awesome! Don't forget, you can go in the mansion. Pop in the mansion to heal. If he takes you down and multi-attacks you, he could kill you. You healed her, right? She's conscious now. I'm just watching everybody barrel to my feet? Holy shit. That changes everything! Yeah. Wait, is this melee? Does this come into play with the cloak? So you're at disadvantage. And that's it? I'm still alive! (roars) 22? Okay. I have 14 hit points. Now it's my turn. I'm so torn, you guys. Do I heal you guys, or do I do damage and go earth elemental? It's a big decision. Scanlan? Pike, you're at one? You're down. What do I do, guys? Do I try and kill him, or do I heal? It doesn't work like that, unfortunately. Okay, fuck! I'm going to cast Sunbeam. I'm going to beam in his face. It's okay. I've got this. Beam in his face. 60 foot, right through them? Can I? What, scooch over one? Yeah, I'll scooch over one. Take a side step to line them up. They have to make a constitution save. Well, they still take half damage. It's 6d8. Normally, they take full damage and they're blinded. It would have been way cooler if it would have worked. Ooh, that's a good roll. 26 points of radiant damage. Then halved. And then I'm going to go air elemental form. That's cool. Can I then take whatever movement I have left to try and drag-- I can't use my movement to try and move someone? That's an action? Then I'm going to use my movement to go airborne. I think I can go 60 feet? Let me see my fly speed. I have 90 feet. Yeah. I give him a little air poof kick in the face, just for flavor. He's getting slushied in the face. I hope that was right. A lot of damage. Come on. Yeah, Grog! Get me that staff! Now we have to deal with the two dragons. I thought Pike had one hit point. Burn this motherfucker! That's pretty good. That's okay. You guys are at two failed? Yeah, do I get an attack of opportunity here? Can I do a spell attack on him? It's just melee, right? Just one slam attack? Nope. Definitely not. Fucking burn this guy down! We're going to live! Oh, fuck. Come on, you guys. Yes, we do. You go. I'm the one who's good at harvesting. I run to Percy. That's right! I don't, immediately. I'm coming with you to have that conversation. I'm coming with you to have that conversation. (sighs heavily) I silently go and start harvesting the white dragon. Let's just hope she stays that way. I start harvesting the white dragon as much as I can. I try as fast as I can-- wait, from who? Oh my god! Can I see it? I really don't want to wait a week. I didn't think I was going to get one, you guys! Sarenrae!
