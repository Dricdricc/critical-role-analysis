Oh my god! Yasha! She's been gone so long, don't take her job! The shirt, yeah, good. Oh no, Jester has amnesia, you guys. I look in the other chamber. Is she in there? Can I check her to see if she's still breathing? Deuces. Have any healing left? Are you okay? I just give Jester a big hug. There was also a really nice firbolg named Nila. Her son and her mate got scooped up. Yeah. It's like him, too. This is Caduceus, he also came with us to help out. We've had an interesting 24 hours. He didn't make it. He didn't survive the trip. I'm really sorry. Fuck! We got cocky and underestimated our enemies. He's buried in the wood. The Bramblewood. Right? No, that's not right. That's the old campaign. That's a fitting name. We can take you there. It's on the way back to Zadash. We've got to talk to the Gentleman, anyway. Fuck him. Protto. No. It's no one's fault. No, it doesn't. I was lying. We overheard them saying that they were trying to break people mentally. Do you know what they were trying to use you guys for? To who? Fuck, you guys. I am so sorry. Well, piece of shit is dead, all his fucking cronies are dead. Caduceus is an interesting one. He's got great hair. Yeah, me too. Whatever he says. Molly laid down his life for you guys. He was the best of us. I would have laid down my life for you guys. Thanks, Jester. Here. I pull out from the back of my-- It's Molly's sword. I think it would suit both of you, but I feel like one of you should have it. We left it to mark his grave. It's probably stolen, but the thought was nice. We're going to fucking slit their throats. Hmm? Thank you, Jester. Oh, shit! Good times, you guys. Hey, guys? Fuck human traffickers, am I right? Okay, let's do it. We rob them blind! Well, we healed her, she's still just-- We get everyone out of the basement and we lay Yasha down upstairs some place comfortable. Oh Shakäste, yay. I love that so much. I'll take one. What was that thing where I could spend a ki point and do another roll on my insight check? It gives me-- oh. Which I already have. Okay, 16. Oh sorry. 15. We can sell them. Shooting a Hostel sequel. (singing) Gimme gimme gimme! Service and payments to the Iron Shepherds. House Jagentoths. Who's Jagentoths? Oh, the house that sponsors The Iron Shepherds. These are the receipts (gasp)-- these are the receipts of--! Yeah! Oh my god! Oh, this could take down the Jagentoths. Blackmail! Nothing's trapped, right? Are you with me? Does it have an open drawstring? Can I look inside? Yeah! Does it seem magical to you? Okay. See how far you hand goes. What else could be in here? Think of the heads of his enemies. But what if they're in there? We don't want to be walking around with heads. He's looking at something. There's something in there! I think Caleb has it, actually, yeah. Can we repair after that? Douchebag ability. We're a little banged up, but we're fine. LIAM and What time is it actually? Hey, Matt? Question. Do I-- between me and Caleb-- who has keen memory-- would we remember how many prisoners were in the stronghold including these guys? And escaped. How many did we let go including Shakäste? Is that what "deliver goods polished" means? Nine delivered? Okay, just making sure. We have polished-- does that mean like--? Beaten in? Yeah, erased. Broken. Someone will keep watch. We handed you that haversack. Healers are like cats. You have to have two so they can keep each other motivated. So funny. (laughing) Competition. I'm going to lay down and take a short rest, as Beau's feeling rough. Tired. I'm going to eat some of Caduceus's food. Mushrooms, and beans. So good. Is it the thing? Is it The Bag? Sorry. I was napping for a moment, what? I think we should stay here. We can drag mattresses down into the living room, light a fire. Fort party. From the bag? He just flipped it inside out! Magic. Why do these things follow us everywhere? Looks like there's a handprint on the back. Oh. It is a very good drawing. I pull out the red gem and hold it next to the picture. Does it look like the same? Ah! But you're from the Menagerie Coast, that's when you guys met. I gave my beaded bracelet to Nott. Nott, you still have my beaded bracelet, right? The jade beaded bracelet? Would it work? They were like, worshiping it. Just straight intelligence? Oh boy. Five. Bummer. Ionos. Matt, what was the Cult of the Caustic Heart? I'm trying to remember. Cult of the Caustic Heart? Yep, yeah. Yep, that's exactly what that was. Are we going-- (gasps) Is it a dope pillow fort? Yep. Beau goes out, grabs a bunch of pillows from the couches and starts throwing them in. Hey, Keg. Stop talking to me, Caleb. That's not-- That doesn't make anything better. Yes! All the things! Yes! Anything I can throw? I'll take an errant dagger or two. Two daggers. What? I mean, I feel like fire is kind of your thing. You sure you want me to have this? That's true, there are like four elements. Means you're going to be sharing a lot. There's going to be a lot of overlap. Yeah. I'll hold on to it. Where does all this stuff inside of you go? You have so much extra storage space in you. Yeah. I know what you mean. I poke my head out and I go You owe me a night! And I go back in. I pop back in and I go I'll be back in like an hour and 20 minutes. If it's two hours, don't come looking for me. If it's two and a half, then get worried. All right. Follow Keg. You just see blankets. It's like when the Sims. I chuckle and roll over and go back to sleep. Smile as I dig into my pillow. Medallion of five o'clock shadow. Oh my god. You guys, I've never gotten morning after-- (laughter) It's almost as good as the Kerrek letter, you guys! Hang on, you've got to have the full experience. First off, "For Bo," spelled wrong. "I love--" You can see it! She was trying to write, "Your eyes are beautiful when you smile. I love-- Thanks." (laughter) I'll cherish this forever. I feel like we grabbed it, right? It's okay. We already got in touch. With Ophelia Mardun, who was-- yes that's what I was about to say. We're doing okay. We already got in touch with Ophelia, who is the woman we were supposed to get in contact with. We were like a day or so late, but she was fine with it. But she wanted us to go kill Lorenzo and the rest of the Iron Shepherds, so it was a very convenient killing one group of slavers with one stone. He makes dead people tea. It's very nice tea. Cemetery tea. Honestly, you could make a lot of money setting up a shop somewhere and selling tea. Ophelia first, then Mollymauk. It's all along the way. There's some carts around back. Two, to be exact. Some horses that'll make up for Waterloo and-- or Water Closet and Loo and Toilet. Oh yeah by the way, we also lost like three horses. They're all dead, too. W.C.'s gone. Sounds good. We steal horses. We make a nice little bed for Yasha and lay her down. Can we break down the cages easily, or bring the cages off the cart? Can we get rid of them, though? I put my hand through the cage bar. Do I see anything? Fuck! Yeah. Sick. I'll take one of the other horses. I'll ride a horse. That was good! Snaps for that one! Happy Birthday Ashley! You could have said it, too! (singing) Ashley, come back! Weird question. The carts aren't sprayed on the side with "Iron Shepherds?" Okay, cool. I'll flip my coat inside out to my brown side and put up the hood. I take everything I just said back. Yeah. She's super hot. No, that's not doable. Do you have a wider gate around back or something like that? You personally? He's very personal with the cart. Um. If you don't mind, it would actually be greatly appreciated to us if we kept that for the fallen member of our party. That's very kind of you. You want us to go with you? That's right, we were supposed to escort her back. Yep. I think hot fuck is actually very appropriate on a few levels. I don't know. Why does she want to leave? This can't be good, right? It's along the way. It's not that this was really the job, it was more like there were two jobs. You had to accept both as opposed to one or the other, and the one was doable and we did it, and the other one-- Well, she said the morning. Eh. Not at all, yeah. Yeah, you guys probably didn't see a lot, considering you were in cages when you came through, but this is a shitty shit-hole. Like a really shitty shit-hole. You live in a very nice garden an hour north of here. The city is garbage. You haven't left in 18 years! It is very beautiful. He is. We asked the same question. Yeah, the smell comes with it. It's got a little musk? Yeah. When you two mix together, it has this meatloaf smell. How many people? That are sitting with her? How many that she wants to sit with her--? SAM and Okay. It's not that we don't care for these animals, it's just that we cared for Water Closet, and Loo, and John way more. I just wanted you to know. But yeah, fuck these horses. Definitely Mamma Mia-- I wish you could still read lips. Yeah, I was going to say I do not miss Sam Riegel giving me shit about my spell usage. Mm-hmm? It's funny. I thought you were going to say something like, "Man, the Empire's sure fucked up." I was going to be like Right? I was just thinking the same thing. It's just like what Jester said we can read each other's thoughts. Well, you know I'm a monk of the Cobalt Soul. I actually dumped a lot of this on Nott. She asked. We were a little tipsy. I was feeling vulnerable in the moment. It doesn't happen often. She caught me in a perfect window. Nott did. Wait-- both? Nevermind. I never intended to be a monk of the Cobalt Soul. My father sent me away to the monastery when I wasn't what he wanted me to be. And I was kind of a dick. So. I ran away from the Cobalt Soul and they gave me a raise in rank because of it. That was kind of cool. Really just further instilled my rebellion, to be totally honest. My whole life was dictated by establishment that I didn't have a lot of control over. The Cobalt Soul has this underlying faction that helps uproot corrupt establishment. I know, I scoffed at the idea of being a part of a system that's supposed to take down systems. It doesn't really make sense, but you know. Maybe you, if anyone, can understand the idea of fighting fire with fire. That's why I'm doing this. No. They just want information. I'm out in the world at the ground level. People like us tend to have our fingers on the pulse of what's being said around the city sometimes. It's not necessarily something that a monk in full accolades can always accomplish. Yeah. Does that make you uncomfortable? Cool. Ew. Don't do that. (laughter) Have we made it outside the city? So we're still north of the Crispvale Thicket. I grab Jester by the hand and walk her over. Really? Right. That makes sense. I think so, too. You know, I grabbed his stupid cards. You want to draw one? Old faithful. (sighs) I put my hand on the other one. (whispering) What's he doing? What did you just do? After a while, you lose track of favors. It's okay. It wasn't a favor, though. You guys are the only friends I've ever had. Most people in my life just leave. Anyone I'm not driving away. I guess I should probably try and start keeping people around at this point. That is an incredibly random thought. And make things better. At least three weeks, right? Did you break down the platinum? We took about 70 gold. I rolled like crap, considering. It's like, "I need to speak to The Gentleman?" I have it written down somewhere. I'm sure we're fine. Yeah. I go Yeah, it's this way. That's to the bathroom. Pay day! We got a tip? Yeah, we probably should've told you that before we brought you in here. Is it still an open bar? I go to the bar. (stage whisper) Someone give him a white russian! (laughter) If you like milk, you'll love this. You all right there, bud? No, you don't. I'm going to sit down as well. Sit in a little booth in the back corner. Back corner boothin'. Oh god. Yeah, it was honestly-- this is why I don't wear white. Fjord, you survived being chained up and tortured. That's got to fuck with a person, right? Fjord, you cannot keep blaming yourself when you were the victim in this circumstance. You understand that, right? There are people to blame. I wasn't joking when I said it was someone's fault earlier, but it is not yours. The only person whose fucking fault it was is that fucking asshole Lorenzo's and fucking human traffickers. There's also no reason that the three of us couldn't have made a fucking plan that couldn't have gotten Molly killed. What do you want to do? Yeah. How did Jester do? No offense, but she seems like she's a little bit more willfully stronger than you are. Yep. I don't know, she looks fucking stoked to me right now. Yeah. You don't drink it because it tastes good. Eyy! If it had to be anywhere. I go (yelling) Jester! Nott! (yelling) Come sit down! Damn it! Go like this, go (trills) Can you feel it? Can you feel that? (gasps) Oh, man. No, you don't have to. That one place right next to the smut shop that had the really good doughnuts? Molly would want us to go to the bathhouse. (singing) To freedom! To the Tealeaf. Now to our new Tealeaf. Oh yeah. You talking about experimenting with how many weapons we can see-- So here's my question. If we don't turn in the crystal eyeball-- TALIESIN and If we don't have that, does that mean bounty hunters are going to come after you? Do we see this? Do we see this happening? She's totally flirting with him just to get the goods. Oh, yeah! She doesn't actually, like, want this, she just wants to maintain a good relationship. Yep. Look, she's like, "Mmm, please stop touching me." Hey, Caleb. You're a good friend. Please don't ever ask me about my sex life. I only have gold; I don't have checks. I light a few cherry bombs and throw them at my friends in celebration. For Molly! (shouting) It's all for Molly!
