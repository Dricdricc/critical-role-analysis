Fail. Maybe they went to sleep? Wait, didn't we see further past that, 'cause that's where Grog did the-- (crushing noise) Yes! Natural 20! Now as that happens, I want to cast Mage Hand and I want to cast Light on it, and I want to slowly have it drift down there. Dagnabbit. Dagnabbit. Okay, fine. Instead I cast Prestidigitation and I make a little glowy orb, and it's a little flickery, and I cast-- I think I can maybe try, what, 15 feet? No. To my left. I wanna see in the dark place. Hm. All right, well, I follow after the bear. (laughter) Matthew, behind the bear. Yes. No, no, the other bear. I mean, the other side of the bear. I wave at them. Hello. I don't think they're our friends. What was that? Right, Pike, but man, that was rough. Pointer face? I scootch up ahead of Grog like, excuse me, excuse me. I'm going to make my way around all this riff-raff, uh, no, uh, yes. I'm going to go past where Vax is in the room down that hallway, then I'm going to do my Mage Hand thingy again. Oh, my Prestidigitation. Mm-hm. Slowly, five feet by five feet. I just stop! And I creep back. They don't see me, right? Oh! I'll cast Blur instead. I'm not going to count that. Oh, I'll count that. 19. (laughter) Because it flew out of my hand, I didn't roll it. Yeah. (laughter) Nope. 17. Yes. No. 17 hits. As everybody is doing this, I'm going to-- why are you blocking me, I'm not supposed to be this close to this thing! Keep going. Oh, like I was saying. Well, shit. Okay, I'll just lift up my hand and go, Firebolt. Okay, okay, 20. Okay, ten, 18, 20, 21, 23. As my bonus action, I'm gonna spend two sorcery points and do it again. So I roll for that. It's a 22. 15 damage. I'm going to wait for everybody to go inside. I motion to Grog and I'm like, you know what to do, damn it. What's going on in there? I hear lots of ruckus. Don't give me that, Scanlan. Oh. Scanlan, you can hear me. What's going on in there? I turn to Grog. They're all dying. 17. I look through the door. What's going on in here? Are there any enemies I can see? Oh. Okay, is he-- (laughs) (laughs) How tall is the thing? No, like, we're in a bunker, right? And the ceiling is-- Oh. I will waltz in behind Grog. I cast Light. And now do I see that guy better? Ah, right. There's another one of those guys over there! Yes! I spend three sorcerer points. No, I have not, because I didn't do anything last game, because I was all recharged. I have eight right now. Now I'll spend it to go down to-- Five. 'Cause math. I could have used it. I cast my pillars, or Grand Columns, as I like to call it, and (piston sound) all the way up and smash that little bastard. He does a dex save, and he takes 6d6 damage, and the dex save is to see if he's pinned or not. Oh, my, what? No. Which is 15, 18 points of damage. Oh, so that-- does that mean he's in the air for a whole round? 'Cause how it works is, he's all the way up to that height, but he gets to come, or fall, back down if he makes the save. That's how-- so he has to travel that distance, so does he cast Levitate as he's coming down? Eight, two of my d6s to heal up. Parkour past Percy! I'm gonna follow suit, but slowly. I make it up to where those guys are. As I hear the noise, I-- Oh, shit. Before I leave, I carefully examine that statue. The facial features of the god, the deity, right? Is that what he is? I'm gonna do a quick arcana check, just to see if there's any kind of mystical thing around it or anything like that. And it's 19. Interesting. Knowing that, I kind of gather my thoughts and I head towards where the rest of the group is. Nice! I make it to the doorway and go, what is going on in here? No! What is it? I check it for 18. For whatever you're trying to hand to me. Absolutely, Scanlan, I'll take that for now. And I put it in my pouch. I have text and whatnot. [break] You mean these shirts? Thanks, Whitey! That's his nickname! It's not like a-- I know. But I said, "What's up Whitey," like, to him personally, and then they look at me like, "Oh my lord, that's so racist." (laughter) I mean, I can. Wait, what? Hold on. Tiberius is gonna work some magic, and then try to conjure up a few more. He was unaware there was a shortage of, of those-- okay. Are we sure there's no other way out of here, through this particular floor? Is that the only exit? Absolutely not! (laughter) That's a terrible idea. Stop talking, stop talking! Hold on. (laughter) No, no, no, you're brilliant, your highness. I have an idea, I have an idea. Eventually, actually, yes. This is what's going to happen. As far as we know, they're all duergar up there, correct? This is what will happen. Those who can go stealth, we will creep up there. I will go invisible myself. I will be in front. You closely behind me. Vax. There we go. You closely behind me, and whoever else can stealth follows suit. I will cast Alter Self and turn myself into their god. I absolutely know what he looks like. We just saw his statue. But that's who they worship. As I give my, whatever the hell I come up with to say at that particular time-- As soon as the mind flayers catch on, and I turn to Clarota, and I turn to Kima, that's when all of you will strike at them first. The rest of you will wait 'til I shoot off a couple of Fireballs at the duergar once they figure out we're full of crap. 'Cause I'm sure that might happen unless I'm super convincing, which I hope that's the case-- But I think that's our best bet to keep a certain element of surprise. Yes, Vax? No, let's go up that one. Yes, of course. Okay. Oh, is that what we need to do? What, what? Oh, I have an idea. Okay, I'll peek around. Sweet. 27. I cast Watery Sphere at the end of the last guy and create a giant ball. What does it look like, Vax? On the last guy. Yeah, and I draw it towards us. And I stop at the last guy. My spell DC, 17. Yeah! Yeah, yeah, because I'm like holding them up. I do. Mm-hm, and I cast Alter Self, and I turn to-- It's a religion check. How tall are the-- So let's make him six feet tall. No, stay in the corner, Grog. Wait 'til I say help me, and then come kill everything. Is this going to be the entrance where we're going in? That's your job. Bust the door open. As that happens, I cast Light and I cast Prestidigitation. I can't hear what's going on. I hear some annoyances in the background as I cast Prestidigitation to make my voice louder. Oh, shit. (shouts) Silence! All of you, silence! Who knows who I am? 16. Well, it looks like there's one saved soul at this point in time. Silence! As I cast-- As I say silence, I blow a big plume of fire out of my mouth, and I cast Control Flames. I don't cast Control Flames. I just do the Fireball for effect. I don't do Control Flames, because that's a concentration spell. Just (fwoosh). 18. 18. That's right, boy. I am Laduguer! You know, and you know your deeds as of late might upset my rest. (shouts) All of you, lay down your arms! And I don't care for you to finish that sentence! I cast Fireball. Right fucking-- Right on him. Of course it is! Uh, 25. Oh, I'm sorry, 30. Quickly. Quickly. Yes. Hold on, I still have a bonus attack I can do before that happens, correct? I got it. 17. Can I still yell out shit while this is happening? Even though it isn't my turn? As this is all going down, I'm going to yell, those who want to live, throw down your arms. That's what I do. 19. As she does that, I try to Counterspell it. Yep. Contested roll. DC equals ten plus the spell's level. DC is 13. It's a third-level spell. Right? Oh, I thought Counter-- Okay, I see. What do you think you're doing, lass? I'm in that form still. (laughter) Cool. This is-- there's still on the altar that's raised above-- and all that. Where we're at? I shall miss nothing. I'm going to stay right where I'm at. I'm going to snicker, and I will (laughs) hand out, put out my hand, and give my little ring a rub, and let out a Fireball from it, right where no one else but these buttholes will get hurt. Six, I have enough, there's a four, this is terrible, help me count, eight. 18. 23! I'm going to spend two sorcerer points. And I'm going to reach out my hand, and I'm going to form an ice knife and-- where is the queen, actually? Oh, very good. I'm going to throw the ice knife right there. And I cast it at level two. Which is 3d6, because it's at level two now. Much better. 14 points of damage. How do you like them apples?! All right! Let's get 'em! I'm maniacally laughing. Ten. Yeah. (sings) In a butthole. Where's it coming from? Hold on. Am I conscious in stone form? Isn't there a dead basilisk right in front of us right now? We just drank the blood last time. The king's almost dead. (groans) He peaced out. Oh, I see. (hoarsely) I rolled a 19! I would like to note that I am frozen like this. 16. 23fu meet Bonertown. Also lives in bonertown.
