I have two quick announcements. Hello, everyone. Greetings and salutations. My first announcement is that I will be sitting on Zac's face this whole game. I have found the pillow. I think it's after. I know this is because I farted already. And everybody check out my Twitch channel with my name. I like it. Where are we entering to? Not at all. I thought you were out of there, man. I see what's going on. You're flying? I cast Fly on myself. I follow suit behind her, and as I'm passing by the person she shat on, I cast Prestidigitation on her. Sorry about that! 17. Copy that. Does anyone have eyes on Vax? Anyone?! Where are you, Scanlan? I assume you're in their chambers. I'll be right there. Fireball to those guys right there! (explosion sound) I wanted to say real quick, right before that, I got to my decanter of water and I start charging it, and then I do Fireball. How much is that? How much is that? 35! What about the door? 30 feet. Can that dude see me from where I am? Good. I turn to him and I'm like, you better get the hell out of my way! And that's my turn. 23! This is where she comes in?! I cleaned you up. Don't worry! That's the United Kingdom. Okay. Move me an additional 30 feet because my flight is 60 feet, so that was from the last turn. Let's swoop in that room. Another 60 feet. How far can I go? Can I go all the way down? Crap, balls. Can I see anything? I can't see anything. Outside? I'm still flying, so can I see? I can't see Vax? I charge my decanter. That's my turn. Oh shit. Yeah. Can I do that? Then I can't do anything else after that, right? Okay, then get me right where I can see Vax. Actually, skootch me one over. I can still see him from right there, yeah? 12. Plus? And I'm right above her? I go, ooh! Nice horns! Oh, he's prone, still. Hers is different. I'm Tiberius Stormwind! 4th-level Counterspell. Were you saying something? Seven. 18. (yelps) (lizard noises) Am I still flying? I'm assuming I fall. Wait! Is it permanent? What the fuck can I do? Is there a saving throw? Well, I guess-- and I'm confused as hell, I assume? I mean, I'm not going to do shit. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to leave. I'm going to go out the door and back in the hallway. And I'm going to whip around to that guy and go, (aggressive lizard noises). Because I know I don't like him. And I'm going to dash. Nice. Where is it? I think that works, is like, if it goes all the way down to zero-- [break] Do I see that everybody's safe? Okay. I'm going to use my lizard-brain and sniff out immediately Allura, and I'm going to go find her. (groaning, fumbling) And I go to Lockheed, and I use my telepathic bond that I have with my pet. And I convey to him, to tell her, I emote to him, with my telepathic link with him, and I (foreign words). That's what I emote to him. Right, and I try to have him telepathically tell her. Help. I do this. (frustrated noises) That's kimchi. Astronaut. I lick all of Vox Machina. I lick Grog the most. I go up to him and start sniffing him. (sniffing noises) I lick the cleric. (licking sounds) No, I just wanted to really do that. That was really inconvenient. Let's help Vax. Yes. I was quite frightened, most of the time. I didn't know what was going on. I couldn't cast spells and I was-- Let's help Vax. That's good, yes. You shit yourself, Vax? I cast Prestidigitation on his butt. As it happens, I reach for my decanter and I can control the charge; it's just charged, but I dissipate the charge. But also keep it for a little bit? No, I dissipate the whole thing. And I turn to the cleric and I go, oh holy man which cured my mind, would you be so graceful as to use the force of Sarenrae to bless the water in my canteen? To bless it. I'm going to hold it up above my head way too dramatically. No, I thought you could like do a Hosannah and get me out of here. Wonderful! How many days, give or take, do you think it might take to accomplish? Oh wonderful! We'll be here for two days, guys? I'll leave it with you. Yes! Good eye! I give you 50. Thank you for your service. The other 25 is for my brain. You don't have to sell it-- And I awkwardly bow out and say See you in two days, oh mighty brain fixer. I don't disagree with any of that. And then we'll loot their bodies. Just because we're in a keep does not mean we are safe. We had Jumanji! Oh, sorry. Damn it! Let's all get some rest, shall we? Do you owe some money? I don't understand. Yes. Guards against scrying? Yes, of course! I don't know what they do, but I'm raising my arm up. Who goes there? Who are you? I've had a really bad day. Yo, Stoneskin's up, dude. I didn't get to say that shit. And 20. Wait, is he casting that? Did he cast Vanish? Sweet. Counterspell. 4th-level, too. No. (humming) What is this? What? I haven't gotten to do much today. And you won't, either. Okay. Can I see the Broker where I am at now? I doesn't matter, I can see good enough. I'm going to spend three sorcery points and heighten my spell, which gives disadvantage on both those two rolls. I'm going to cast a 5th-level Fireball right on the cusp where it hits those two buttholes. There it is. That's what heighten spell does. 17. All of them. And then I'm going to spend one sorcery point to empower the spell. And then I'm going to use the six and I'm going to choose one, two, three, and four, and five, and six to re-roll. Empower spell is the only one that doubles with any other metamagic. I can do it. 46. (spellcasting sound effect) Before he does that, I go (laughing), I look over at Keyleth, and I use bonus action to cast Misty Step and I go right next to her and I vanish. I make it. But it's fire? Good, instead of missing it I'm going to (swoosh, gulps) swallow it. (grunts) That's 20. My dex save was 20. Sorry. Blowing smoke through my nose (snorts). And that's my turn. It was very impressive. Good job, Grog! That's my mother's name. Unless you invite them. Counterspell! 5th-level. Fuck it. 23. That was a wonderful toot, Scanlan! Where do I put this d10? Doesn't matter. Cool. I'm going to go as far as I can towards the old broad. He hasn't taken any damage, has he? Am I within 60 feet of the old lady? That's pretty far still. Don't know whether I am or not. Okay. I am within 120 right? So what I'm going to do instead, is I'm going to look down and I'm going to pull out my Krull Blade and I'm going to throw it in the air and cast Telekinesis on it (spinning). And I'm going to go, (swishing) and I'm going to huck it at the chick. That's 31. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13. And I'll bring it back to me. I'll keep it hovering, maintain the spell. I'm going to bonus action Misty Step towards where Grog is. That's my turn. Smart to not test your fate, boy. Krull Blade in the neck. It's kind of funny. Oh, wait a minute, hold on. And I as he's walking away, I'm going to loot that dude. Take shit off him. Come on. Hold on, let me take this. Hold on a second, why would we keep this one around to tell us now? What'd be the point? I will kill this man unless you give me a good reason not to. While this is going on, I'm writing on a piece of scroll right now. Which I give to him. Not tourist-friendly? I would actually like to know how you keep your horns so shiny and clean. That's what that feels like.
