Ooh, I love gigantic sacks I'm waving through it. Hold on a second, ask the question. What are we asking? And believe me when I tell you he usually kills everybody. He doesn't give that offer very often. (all laugh) Yeah! Shush! Which way should we head? I mean, is there any particular shortcuts or less running into your kind along the way, I suppose? Oh! Prestidigitation. And I catch it and throw it back into his face. Well, that's a good thing. As is his undergarments on for-- I don't care to see that. That's a mind flayer. Will you stop with the naked? Grog-- A d20 roll. Well, I'm satisfied. I agree. Take the hammer. That's rough on him. Leave his armor on. I thought you meant you wouldn't get dirty, like you know, not spoiled. Which I was totally fine with. He's gone. Oh shit. I'm going to loot the body. Clarota, that was incredible. Well done! Yes, indeed. He was a general. Yes, that hammer is amazing, obviously, because we saw it in action. I'd say Grog should have it. And I'll do an arcana check, right? An arcana check on the stuff? 23. I did. Oh, oh, ooh! I think Pike and Grog would benefit from these, most definitely. Here. I mean, it's dark in color. But it's, you know, your standard arcana magic. That's true. What do I see? I'm still on the roof. Oh guys, the jig is up! What? And we're all on the carpet? Yes. 20. I see where it's coming and I shoot a Fireball. 22. By the way, 41 points of fire damage. Yes! I'm not concerned with the bear right now! Who's not stealthed? Wait, what? Are we under them? Are we under them? Go under them! I cast Glacial Blast and I create a bridge that scoops them up, right under them. As we dive right under them. Huh? No! Damn it! No, I didn't think of that. Oh no. Get me close to him. I cast Featherfall on you. Who needs Featherfall? I can do it in a bunch! Before where the drop is, and that's where that bottom tunnel is down there? Okay. Where's Grog at? Can I leap towards him? Off of the carpet! Yes! Right now, while I'm doing this, I'm going to cast Featherfall on myself. Oh. It would, wouldn't it? I thought it was only when going down. Whoa. Okay. 15 and 13. Now I'm going to cast Featherfall. Do I have to do one also? So we can see the ledge and that cavern where we were, where we found the-- Yeah, yeah, we have some time left-- I'd like to know-- on the way down, I was doing a little chant and I was expending my sorcery points to do Flexible Casting, so I regain a slot spell on my third-level spells. No, this is-- Yeah. Are we all in the tunnel? I wait for everybody to pass and I cast all my Grand Columns. Three. That's it, that's what I did the SP for, so that I could cast this right now. I have none in my column. No, I had one. (whispers) Oh, it's 30-- It's not enough, is it? Are the caves stone? Like the cave-- Can I like, do it from the side? Can I attempt to? Oh! Oh yeah! There you go! It's-- Oh! They're columns. You're good. The wall's good. Good. Oh! Wait! Hold on! Come on! We need to save him! Recess the wall, recess the wall! Oh! Boom! Now I cast Glacial Blast, right under him, like a slide, right towards us-- and catch him. Nice. Ooh! Light! Yes. Hold on! Incline means up. Decline means down. Actually, there's two tunnels, right? And one's smaller than the other? Hm. I know. How big is the-- how wide is the smaller one that we're going through? Yeah. Oh man, oh no! Let's go, everybody! Let's go! If this is where we're gonna be chilling, I can seal off that tunnel still. Right. No, it's permanent. But we would just have Grog hack away at it for a while-- It can be, you know, destroyed. Right! Kima was here. I need to rest. Yes. Possibly. Possibly. Should I seal the tunnel? Cool. So I do. But we would sure hear them, if they were-- Oh. I actually have to rest completely, so I can't do shifts. I need all my spell slots. It's a bit iffy. More like a shotgun. You haven't even played with your hammer yet! Yeah, it's sealed. Right. Yeah, you need-- Ah. You fools! What's happening? Is anyone particularly dirty? Duragar. Can we do that? How high is that roll again? I love bats. Very good. I feel fine. Yes. Oh. Nasty horn. Is that your cousin? Right. Three different places. Is that where we should go? Ah, this is where we need to go, I'm assuming. There's a bathroom right over there, Percy. So get there, get K'varn. By the way, I take one of the earrings from Scanlan and give it to Grog. So Grog, now you've got one of the-- Well? He's not saying anything. Yes, sounds good. She's excited about the lava. 19. I got scared and I cast Stoneskin immediately. Stoneskin. How much does the ogre weigh? Or the ogres, as you said? Nice. Nice. Very good! I'll take a few steps forward and be like, well, this is poppycock! And I'll shoot a Scorching Ray right at the dude. So what am I rolling? Oh! Like can I just in general? No. I rolled all three at once. 'Cause I have to do one for each. So I got a 12, a 13, and a 12. Damn it! Wait, do I add my dex on those? (whispers) What's my spell modifier? Oh! Oh, no, I'm sorry, 20-- plus nine on all that. Yeah, sorry. Okay. Okay, first one does five-- -- plus five, ten! I rarely do this one, kids. Ten on the first one. 17 on the second one. And 17 on the second one. No! I mean, 12 on the third one. Yeah, straight damage. Yes! Yeah! I thought it was going to be a good thing! Is that what Sam would do? Take out the ogre first. Courteous! Nope. That's a weird spell! Yeah. Cool. No, you'll get in the insect cloud. You'll get in the insect cloud. Rage, urine, and death. Fire hammer! That's right, he's weak. Right. Oh. What are you talking about? A 17. Oh, I look at him with a funky grin. It's a funky one. How much does he weigh? 800 pounds? Ah, beautiful. I cast Telekinesis and I hurl him over my head and chuck him at the other one. I want to get him away from Pike. I don't think I can throw him that far. How far away is he from the lava, actually? Then I'll try that instead. I'll try to slam dunk. I use two sorcerer points, and with the other one I do Glacial Blast at the other guy. Spell attack, right? 13 plus two. 15. Okay. Okay. Oh! Right behind it? Do I see myself missing too? Fine. As I'm missing I'll form it into a spike at the end where the walls hit. I'm going to-- where's the-- that way. Out the hell-- with the stuff-- yes. Nice! No. You shouldn't be doing melee on things that can split in half to begin with. You messed everything up. Oh, every other time is fine. Yes! Damn hook whores! Ah very well. I scooch myself a little bit over behind him. Yeah, that's good, I can see his fanny from here. I'm going to cast Glacial Blast again, but I'm going to form a giant spike once more and jam it right in his asshole. And I'm going to try and catapult it right where it's over. Because it's still at the edge of the lava pool, right? Magic ice kancho blast. 24. Yeah. One, two, three, four, six. That is eight. What is that, a 12? 15, 16, 18, 19. 20. 20 damage. I'm not trying to grapple him, I'm trying to just push him. Yeah. Because he's like swinging at that dude so I'm like up his keister. Okay. Nice. Yeah. I'll spend another two points. After this, I'll have five. Because we had the rest, I regenerated all my stuff. So I spent two already. I spent another two on the fight. And I'm going to do another one. Up his ass again. Yeah. 20. Yeah and that is 15. 15 points of damage. And his butt. From his arsehole. Bonus. Magma and acid. Oh, Light! Yeah. I feel fine! All the time, yes, Vax! There's an acid guy! Stab. (all laugh) Grog! Will you put those away! It's true! I don't know what that means! We went down and just-- Bocce ball?
