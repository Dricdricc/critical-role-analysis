I was thinking the whole time, I was like-- dicks. I don't know what would be worse, a dragon or a beholder. Actually, just throw them all to Sam. Hey Matthew? Nice sack. I already got a set, jpcguy already gave me one, so I'm good. I don't watch sports, but I know these names because that's when I used to watch sports, and those are cool names. That is ace. I have one more, we have a message, a letter from our friends over at Gamechanger. "Dear Critical Role and Geek and Sundry team, huge thanks to all of you for having us on "your show, promoting our charity and supporting the DX15 campaign." Which is the Deus Ex campaign we were doing. "Your support truly made a difference in the campaign and Taylor and Jim had "an awesome time in your studio. So cool!!!" Three exclamation points. "We would love to work "together in the future and hope that someday all of you or some of you can join us at the hospital "and deliver gifts and joy and inspiration to the young patients and show your gaming-- show how "gaming plays such a critical role in their treatment." I accept that challenge, I will do that. "Much love, from Gamechanger, Jake Hearst and Jim Carroll." Flipside-- Oh, Zac, pay attention. "We bought Final Fantasy Type 0 for a giveaway during the Deus Ex thing, but never got a "chance to promote it. So we would like to offer it to you and the team members could give it away to "your audience any way you'd like." Zac. "So no strings, just a thank-you gesture, token of "appreciation, and love to all the Critters out there." If Felicia's in that, it's gonna be fun. Tune in for these ladies too, please.
