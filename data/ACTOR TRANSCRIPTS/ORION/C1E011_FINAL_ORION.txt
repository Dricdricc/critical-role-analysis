Oh shit! It's this, but gray. Thank you so much. Who's the name of the guy? Our magic carpet? Matt Aberny, I believe? Yes, Aberny. If we're saying your name wrong, I will say it right next week. I'm sorry. But you're awesome. Abernathy? You know who you are. Thank you. They're awesome. Yeah, and it rocks. Kit, we love you. She's so good. Grog! It's of my ancestor. Different energies, man! What do you mean? What do you want me to do? Guys, I'm just gonna sing a song right now. Hey, you're wearing a cool shirt. You what? It takes a while for me to do that. It takes like at least a few hours to make Sleep arrows, right? Action Math. Nice! You yell it across. Boom! How many do you need? I got much. What am I doing right now? Oh, good. 18. That close, Ash. That close to just spitting out all my coffee. I'll follow suit, and be like Oh, is this what we're doing? Scanlan! What are we doing? Oh, uh, very well. I'll Watery Sphere and help him maintain him. Yeah. Like, it's a dope-ass effect. Yep. Wizards of the Coast, page 304. What are you talking about? How big is it? I can capture those, but not that guy. So, hold on. I knew that! I do that to wash him off. And I'm swirling around, I'm like, does this feel good, giant? Currently washing his hump. Three over here. You can do non-lethal damage to him. We are. She can knock him out, though. You mean for a snack, though, you're saying. We need more of his brutish, tank-ish strength. Could you perhaps put him to sleep for the evening? We'll secure him, but Clarota, could you prolong the Sleep spell for eight hours so we can rest and you could do your spell? I hand him some jerky. It's really delicious. Engorgio? Right, it is poisonous. It's fine. If he did something, we'd kill him. It's a minute to cast. Let me sleep, hold on. I'm going to encourage success. Yeah, stop posing for just a second. Take the chains off. I believe we should take the chains off. I saunter up. Hello. I'm really impressed. Are you our friend, now? Oh, well, wonderful! Tell him to follow our orders. That's all he needs to know for now. Oh, good! Vex, you got that? Could you translate that? 30 days. I walk up to the giant and I take out my jerky. Do we all have to say it that way, Vex'ahlia? He likes the jerky. We should ask his name and be polite. I'm going to inspect it. Arcana check. 23. Oh, this is, of course, the Javelin of Lightning. This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it, and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning. Yeah. (laughter) I'll do a history check. Nature check? What kind of check? The giant guy? It depends on what we say. I am not setting foot in that temple quite yet. He's fine for 30 days. No, we are not. TALIESIN AND I am telling you right now, I am not setting foot in that thing's lair. Until we figure out a damn way to get it out of that lair. Absolutely. Percy! I'm saying this right now, I'm not stepping foot in that lair! I think we can, actually. My idea is this-- With the new addition of our giant friend, we do have a great advantage. We can definitely make the distraction, as you say. I propose, Keyleth and another stealth member somehow see a way if there is some kind of ventilation that leads into the Major Butthole's chamber. Yes. Absolutely. And, when finding this, craft some type of piping system where we could smoke him out. If he has to breathe, which I believe aberrations need to breathe and eat. If we smoke him out and he cannot breathe, he must leave the facility. And if we go in there we would be at an extreme disadvantage in many ways than we realize. I just proposed the idea. I don't know, but that's what we all need to figure out. That's what I'm talking about. Oh, so there are prisoners, right? Oh, so, I'm sorry, I was misled earlier. So this is the good part of the plan. We do exactly what you're saying, first. Clarota, here, will rally the illithid to fight for us. That's when we smoke out the beholder. We do it a different way. We don't go near him. The room that he's in is sealed up? Oh my god! That is incredible. I am not going anywhere near that temple. I mean, I suppose that could work, possibly. Just has to be line of sight, right? Mm-hm, right, yeah. Actually that could work. I could do it from afar, maybe on the carpet. Yes. I bring out the yellow vial. This is the thing that's going to hurt the most. Do you have a rusty trombone? (groaning and laughter) It will simply just heat it. Of course I can. Not saying it is, Clarota. Ooh, that's right. Doesn't quite work that way. It works on creatures. I'm not sure I could do this. Clarota, how much does the crystal weigh? Keyleth, what did the structure look like again? Many structures like this-- We won't have to, maybe, do any of that. If we could just, merely bend the structure, I believe that would compromise the magical integrity. Usually structures like this are designed for a particular arcane reason. If we were to merely damage it, Grog you could just as you do to most things. I mean, I could probably help as well, along with Clarota, but that's an option. It would only carry you. Right. Hold on. Vax, are you planning on going alone? That's silly. That's even more silly. He sent me this? Well, I'm keeping it. Yeah. That's fine. All right, how many are we away from that? Let's go. [dramatic music] Look, Grog! And I cast Prestidigitation and I make fart noises. (fart noises) Oh look, I'm farting! (makes fart noises) I figured he'd like that. I pick up a piece of the cask, I take my wheel out (whizzing noises). I was trying to tell you that before you hit the creature, but it worked out. Pike, what is a movie? Oh, like light! Like that? We do not want that. No, I like the first half of that idea, Vax. No. That idea will work as well, too. I think what we should do is do the mouse thing. Whoever-- I guess we make the effort to go in, however we can manage, to get into the top of wherever we are going to attack those beams, as it were, to do damage to the thing controlling whatever. That's when we should lightly drop him in as a mouse. Because when this takes enough damage, which he should, as a mouse, the spell will wear off. And he would poof back into whatever. We should do it right on the beholder. Because that, I think, would be more a distraction for the creature. A beast against a nasty beast is always a good fight. We need all the people in the town alive. Clarota will be upset if we hurt anybody and we need their aid. I suggest, because I have a feeling that because this is his lair, he will have, and I'm talking about K'Varn, he will have advantages that we do not understand. If we go in. And we will have disadvantages. Exactly. I'm saying, that is why. So if we threw our rather large friend here in, and do the thing, that will get us control and Clarota can help us manage everyone in the town. Even the slaves will rally. That's what I'm saying. After we've destroyed the mechanism. Right. That's why we cannot attack the town. Bats will be a problem. Bats catch fire rather quickly, if I recall. No, that's when we get out and smoke him out. If you're talking about fighting K'Varn in his lair, when he attacks you-- Absolutely not, Vax. Possibly, yes. That would be the best-case scenario. And where's beholder-face? Actually, if everything starts going amiss, I will make the call. Follow me and I will get out of here as soon as possible. If I'm dead, then I'm afraid none of you will survive. What? We have to be on the carpet? Is that a carpet joke? I can make a portal that we can all step in and bamf to-- We have to be where I cast it, yes. Yeah. Yes. Oh, Percy, yes. I believe it's this. I'll do the signal. So yes. So that's a no. There he is! No, I cast Fly on him and I hop on his back. This time you can see. This should be a lot smoother. Oh no he didn't. Two trips, wait what? Why? Yes, of course, but outside, here with me. And, Lady Kima, you must survive. Because you must tell Allura of my deeds. For no particular reason. No, you'll keep Fly up. Because I can just hop on the carpet. I'm casting it twice. But Trinket can get on the carpet. He needs a diet. Wait a minute, hold on. Hold on a tick. How much can you lift, Grog? So a shit-ton. No no no. I mean one at a time. I cast Fly on Trinket. Oh, wait. And I'll do that. I'll wait, because I can only do it one at a time. So I'll burn it for him. Let's go. I'll burn it for Trinket. The Fly. Not right now. No. We'll go up first, then I'll come back down with the carpet, I'll cast Fly on him and whoever is-- I'll stay down with Trinket. Because I don't need to go up. Plus ten. 23. Yeah. I'm staying on the carpet. No, I had to go with you so I could take the carpet back. So I can come back with the carpet. Because they're dropped off. Shit. That's 19. Yeah. Thank you. Before I leave to go back down, Vex? When you see it, be sure to mark the beast. Yep. Trinket, Trinket! Think of Vex. Go to Vex. Go to Vex. She's up there. It's very cool. 23. It's your first time. It's going to be a little rough. How far away is it from me? Forget about it. I thought you said roll. Oh. I think you said, "I cast Talk to Bats." Hmm, good. I stay on the carpet. Are there any jutting stone things, anywhere around? It's just flat? I should do it, too. As I do this, I go to the Bag of Holding, and I go to the Endless Rope-- Oh. Yeah, I know. And, the Endless Rope? As I'm asking for that, I take out my Immovable Rod and I'm going to place it, kind of, in an exit position and (clicks)! Make it stay right above there. And I start flipping through the rope so it goes-- The whole time, I'm just doing that so it goes all the way down. 25. I agree. I think that's poppycock. We'll be fine. Yes. Come up. Just shoot him wherever we need him to drop, and (pfft). Oh, 'cause he's fat? Yes, I'll take the mouse. Throw me the mouse. DM, which side has the crew worked on relative to where I am looking at? Did they damage this side or this side? Use the boots. Not me, I am chilling. So then they've been working on this side, right? This way, wonderful. Right before things happen, I'll cast Blur. I going to aim and-- I swoop down and pick everybody up. I know, I'm going to start to-- 19. Everyone use the rope. It's time to leave. Yes. Yes. Wait, that's all I can do? No, Clarota! Shoot the damn eye! She's not on the carpet. I'm going to say it's-- The strength is 50. Yeah, but I can, like, dash and double my movement speed as well. Which I should've done last turn. 'Cause I don't want to go there. Oh, shit. Okay, well, can I still dash with that and double that speed of the carpet? Okay, well I don't wanna get anywhere near that. I actually want to hover around to the city side. And I want to look and see what's going on with the crowd downstairs. Yes. Are you surprised? I'm not. I don't care. I'm doing it through here. What the hell do you think I'm doing? I'm angry at all of you right now. Fastball Special. As far as, down, as I could have been to begin with, so even-Steven with those guys. What do I see in the town? Do I see a mass anywhere? Natural 20! (cheering) Great, I jump off the carpet. I cast Fly on myself. I go to where I can just, right, hover-- I want to hover above them, about 20 feet away. And as I come to it, I'm going to flip out the carpet, get on it, cast Alter Self, turn into Clarota. I'm going to keep my original lungs. Yeah. I'm going to-- Yeah, I'll spend whatever I gotta spend. I'm doing all of it. Can they see me? The crowd that's coming? That's what I-- I'm going to go towards the crowd. I wanna-- No, I dispelled the carpet so I can do double my speed so I can get there, and then I redo the carpet as I-- No, I grabbed it. As I'm going with me. I can't do that? Well, that's not going to be as cool. Well, then I'll just stay on the stupid carpet, then. If I'm, like, down at that level then I don't really have to do that. I'll cast Alter Self though. Turn into Clarota. Do I-- actually, sans head piece. Clarota without the head piece. And what do I see when I get down there? How far away are they? Great. You, over there! Quickly! And I get their attention. Look, I took the form of one of your own. Pretty much to get your attention. We need your help. We want to defeat the one who's taken control over your mind. We are the ones who disabled the crystal to begin with. Please come on this-- With me. We can go much faster. Up here, please! Damn right. Six plus ten. That's 16, plus nine is-- My persuasion's nine. Plus 16. Six. Plus nine. That's 25. Oh yes. Not if they're allies. Well, I guess that was something. Noticing that, then, I will go to-- I don't have another movement, right? Or was-- That's what I do. Why are you cheerleading somebody? Very good. I'm not-- That's probably not going to work. I head back up to the top. Actually, no, I don't. I go to the side of the temple where the rope that I was throwing earlier goes and meets down to the floor. So I-- Yeah. I will-- No, I-- Fuck, no. Hold on a second, I don't do that. I redact that. I have the fucking carpet, okay. I go back to the top. I can get up there, right, like where they are? Does he see me? That's what I mean, like is he looking at me, right now? Okay. I'm going to cast Telekinesis and rip his horn off his head. Well, that doesn't happen. Oh, actually-- I used that. Yeah, no. That doesn't hit. So I'll have to spend another-- Okay. Then I'll spend five more and I'll attempt to rip off one of his tentacles. I'm going to check that last one off. Check this off. I'm blast-- I'm using all these from my Ioun stones! I, yeah. That hits. What is that? My, 20-- Oh no-- Fuck what I said, it's 29. Yeah. Oh, it does damage? Four. And I hop off the carpet and I leave it there. Or, I hand it to-- Who's next to me? Uh, you. And that was a terrible movie. How many stalks does it have left? Left? Okay. Where is it, actually? From where-- Oh. Okay, I'll do a-- I'll shoot a Glacial Blast at him. Just a concentrated-- I'll spike it right before it hits him and jam it in his fucking eye. Yes. 6d8. Oh shit, I need d8 for this. Do you have d8s? I got it. That is 40. What, really? Two of ten times. Okay. I'll just-- I mean, like I said. Right before I do it, I'll shape it into an ice spike and right through the eye. Wonderful, while I-- No! I spend five Sorcerer points and I do Telekinesis and rip the horn off his fucking-- That's it after that. It's my turn. What is that? Oh, that's 26. I'll hold it in place for now and kind of-- Yeah. Yeah, I just killed it. Don't tell me what to do, dawg. Wait 'til we're not fighting. I hold it here. I don't want to-- Oh. As I see that, I'm going to float this more towards me. And I take it-- Now, it's hovering above. I'm going to hold it about 25 feet away from me in the air. Irresponsible-- You have no idea. You have no idea what you guys are in for after this. I'm not going to-- That's not-- That's the next episode. Sweet! Yeah, that was my first. Oh, Elven. Thank you. Thank you, man. That's debatable.
