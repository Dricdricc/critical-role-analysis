Yeah. I recently started my own Twitch stream. So you can follow me and watch. I play a lot of video games, guys. It's horrible addiction that's amazing. But it's @orionacaba on Twitch. It's weird. I am actually hosting Geek and Sundry on my channel right now. Yeah, I do. Thank you. Oh, cheer up, Vax. She'll be back soon. I've never seen you quite so down. Yes, it's implying that someone has died. And no one has. So, you know. I agree. Stormwinds should not be meddling around with these peasants. Are we in a tavern? Barkeep, bring me your finest ale for my friend here and for the lady. I'll take a water. And I flip him a couple of gold coins. I have one; don't forget that. I'm good on potions, but we should restock our supply. I have, let me see here, three potions of greater healing, and three regular potions of healing. I suppose. If we're just going to buy more, it doesn't matter. But just in case something happens along the way. Yes, so we'll go buy more. And then we'll see what else they have. I would like to see if we can procure a couple of items, like a couple of empty vials. I've used a lot of mine. Maybe find some acid or whatnot at these item shops. So let's look around and get the stuff. He's saying he left with the flying carpet, Keyleth. He left with it. We don't have it. I held it for a time, but I only have my Wheel of Mending in mine, as far as I know. Hold on, let me check. I'm thinking really hard. Hold on. Oh here it is. Shut my mouth. I guess I was wrong. 16. I approach. Yes. I still don't know what that means. But I am actually happy to see you, milady. Yes. Yes, there is. You mentioned before, when I asked you last, of the Boros Ring. You revealed that it was in the Fey, the Wild Fen. I am also in search of the item that I did not get to ask you about called the Pale Stone. I wish to know the location of that, as well. Since you're not in the business of information, then we are in the business of procuring some specific items. Potions. I'm looking for a few empty glass vials. Perhaps some acid, if you have it. You don't have to be all nasty about it. I have the money. Here you go. Yes, I know something bad is going to happen. I show them the box. I take it and pick it up. This is all she had to offer. She's not taking questions. She does that, Vax. A lot. Yes. Good day, madam. What did we actually get? I'm going to give you another one of the greater potions. So mark that down. So we should go there. Yes, and usually I'm the cranky one. So let's head to the temple. Right? Yes? Can you turn into a horse? I'm just asking. Oh, the Take? What would make you feel better? That was that one carpenter we met in in Vasselheim. Yes, he did. He sure knew how to-- it was dank. They'll be fine. I'm sure of it. Scanlan makes good decisions all the time. Listen, don't be smug with me. None of us what to be here or cooperate with this stupid event just to abide your laws. The answer is yes. Let's get on with it. Oh. Well, thank you. Can we use the word liaison? Yes, she is. I am Tiberius Stormwind. Ah, a religious man. Hello, I'm Tiberius Stormwind. Yes. Yes, she is. It grows on you, though. Oh, they're a fun group. Would this be an arcana or this be a history check? I'm going to do an arcana check. 18. This seems to be bothering you, Kashaw. It's going to say the same thing. Which part? Well, dwarf, why don't you do your title and lead then? And I should warn you, you are walking with a Stormwind. You may not know my name, but I can assure you, I alone am an army, so we are well protected. So, lead us to find this tiger-man, please. Wind. People call me Tibsy. Well, I mean "rakshasa" does sound fun. Rakshasa! No, it gets better. It's a demon. Thorbir is what they meant to say. That's true. We've seen that. Okay. What am I doing with this sand? Yes. I agree. You did the fancy spell. I'm assuming there's no stables around. So I don't get all dirty. Hammertime oubliette. What say you, Thorbir? Yes, I like that phrasing. That's actually a good idea, as well. Did you say this was the Bahamut part of town, too? Yes, I would agree. Great. Do you have potions? Are you all potioned up? Are you good on items, Thorbir? I'm just fine. Well, let's go talk to one then, shall we? Yes, Kashaw. Very well. 20? Hold on. Everybody calm down. Hi, I'm Tiberius Stormwind. My friend Thorbir here didn't mean to offend, of course. Fair enough. WIL and Scanlan? Have you been talking to Scanlan? He likes whores. Okay. It's weird. Is there a way that the bastions could organize some kind of gathering of sorts? Perhaps a mandatory town meeting, where all would have to gather for maybe an announcement or something official? May we seek audience with this Raven Queen? Oh. She's not here? We're new around here. I'm sure quite a few. And if we could pinpoint when it actually started, we know years, but actually when, then we can actually narrow it down to the establishments and other things that were established then. Or the owner himself. Yes. Oh, I agree. I cast Alter Self on myself and turn myself into an elf. You're half-elf right? I'll turn into a half-elf, akin to a high-born half elf. You look okay. He's just stealthing. She does that. Just agree. I think it's maybe because you're not his sister and it would be weird because that's his sister's name. But she's a female. Life lessons, yes. Are we on our way there now? Now I change. I change, because it only lasts a certain amount of time. I'm a boy. I say it's equally-- no, it's fine. Now I cast Alter Self. Wait, Vax. What was my role in this? Financial advisor. Excellent. I approach right next to Vax, as we move up. Scanlan. In Draconic I go, greetings and salutations, friend. Not yet. We are new to this place. My master here is seeking audience with his kind. We were guided to this place. This establishment has a high reputation. We wish to inquire how to get inside. Oh, not elvish, but more people of high society. High society here. 21. May we seek audience with him to ask or apply, or however that goes about. In Dwarvish I say, that's correct. Your wonderful employees mentioned membership. We'd like to acquire that as well, I assume, as well. Thorlaxalux, at your service. I bow gracefully. What is that? 16? I know many languages. I was a bit of a shut-in as a child. All I had were books on languages to read and whatnot, and adventures and what have you. As she finishes that, I dispel Alter Self. My apologies. I am Tiberius Stormwind-- yes, wind. I merely dispelled this to show you that earning your trust is in our best interests. I do not wish to deceive. Many people don't take kindly to a red dragonborn by the way. I just thought it was best. We're in a new town and it was standard protocol whenever we visit a new town. My apologies. We're fairly sure you know of this. You calm down. I'm going to approach him and I'm going to cast Mage Hand. I'm going to have it float right up in front of me. I'm like, now, you better start cooperating, because it seems to me that you're getting very nervous. And we don't want to do anything. Nor do we want to leave. All we want is information. I guess we want to know what you want to know, too. We want a lot of information. So start talking and stop acting like a fool. 15. I disperse the magic hand. More calm. There we go. Thank you. Where are they? We fought a beholder before. And we could protect you from them. Or it. As we said, it. As I see her do this, I open the scroll of Polymorph. I do Polymorph on myself, and I turn myself into a gadfly. And follow. As a gadfly, can I really quickly buzz in front of him? How far away is he from me? How far away is the guard in front of him? Oh god, we have a map. Okay, so he's right there. Oh! So I'm within 20 feet of him, whatever? Okay. Ah. I'm going to dispel Polymorph, and I'm going to cast Silence in front of him. I'm going to silence him. Yes. Yes. I believe so. Sorry. What is that? 17. I'm going to cast Telekinesis and grab him that way. It's the rakshasa! That's him! No. I yell at you, don't chase him! But she can hear me. And I'm not that far. You heard me, the other way! The other way! And I move in the room with these guys. The rakshasa! Nothing works on him! And I think that's not normal! Yes, sorry! Rakshasa. I believe the dwarf is the rakshasa. I cast many things, and Keyleth is in there, nothing hit him. Can I see what's going on? Where'd you say the guards came from? What was that guy's name? Lohan? Hosin? I just disperse Silence, and before I go out, I turn into Hosin. Alter Self. How did he sound, again? I don't remember. Oh, right, right. What's all this noise out here? What are you bothering my friends for? Guards! Everything's fine. These are friends. Get on with your business. Get back on patrol. Make sure nothing happens or I'll have your heads. 28. Go on, get out. If we've stopped pursuing, does that take us out of initiative? Thorbir. Do you have an extra sword or arm on you? Perhaps a shortsword? As he's doing that, I'm going to drink a potion of frost giant strength. With his jeweled dagger, I take out my dagger. I feel great. Should I do a perception on that? Nope. Oh! I'll motion over there. Before we go down, I'm going to take off my outer-- no, I can't take off anything because that's all my gear. Never mind. I don't do that, but before we go down I cast Stoneskin on myself. I cast that right now. Even though I'm still a dwarf, though. As he's milling about, Light. Dagger. Because I have two daggers in my hands. Sorry, I usually just do it when it's dark. I'll follow. I'll keep on Thorbir's six. I'll stay 15 feet behind him. I mean, well done, rogue. I dispel Alter Self immediately so I have longer-ass legs. It's been 15 minutes. Time has passed. Never mind. I don't do shit. I cast Fly on myself and fly. Oh! As I'm flying, I turn around with my ring and I cast Slow on the boulder. Damn it. I Gandalf it. Oh! Awesome. Is it at least ten to 15 feet away from me? Sweet. As I'm now frustrated, I cast a 5th-level spell, and I will cast my Obelisk of Iron, three in a row behind me. That should stop it right there. I keep Gandalfing. As I see this happening, I run over and go like, this looks like a lot of fun! Oh. Has ten minutes passed? I thought ten minutes? It only lasts for like ten minutes. Yeah, I go, this looks like a lot of fun. And I go and I slide. My dex was 18, by the way. I put up my nose scales. I'm laughing, by the way. As we land, I look around. Oh, that was a lot of fun. I cast Prestidigitation three times in a row and clean us all up. Or at least our faces. You're making it worse. Now it's smoky and smells. Prestidigitate it out of my face. Oh shit. I go invisible. Yeah, all this and again, thank you for doing this because portions of this goes to an amazing charity and we love all the people at 826.
