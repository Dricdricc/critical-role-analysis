Hey everybody. Hi guys. Hi. Right. Am I here? And I walk over to Grog and I open their bag of holding and take out my wheel of mending and I put it in here. We're face-timing? Hey! Hi Guys! I was like that's, "That's Laura's voice, where the hell is that coming from?" Travis is there too! Sorry! I could have sworn I cast that and said that last game. Oh shit. (all laugh) Right. Okay. Where's Scanlan now? We're all eating breakfast still right? Hi everybody. I'm going to take off my ion stone that's kinda chilling. I don't know. (all laugh) I would like to take another 500 gold from the treasury before we do that. And I do. That's all I do. That's all I want to do. I cast prestidigitation on myself and make robes are all super clean and nice. I'll follow Vax. Seriously Matthew?! Come on! Friends. I'd like to google perfunctory real quick.

Do you want one? Yes. Now, this is the Vex I miss. I’m gonna hand her also a ticket, a scroll of telescription and be like, Of course. I hate when you call and you know that they’re there and they don’t pick up. Oh, shit. She’s not here. We have over that. Because Vex and Grog are with us. And they have -- The trick is, we don’t know how much the total is. It’s well over thirty. I think we have closer to fifty. ... maybe forty. Here they are. (all cheer) So we have 50,000 total. Because we just had 30, we just got paid 30 grand, right? That’s added? I thought we were at 30 -- Right, but -- That’s who owed us. What? So we’ll have to go back and get it. Wait, I can’t -- You should get the mithral shirt, it adds something to your -- Twenty-four total, before the dwarven-- Perfect. No, ruby. Oh sweet, and they froze there. Oh no, they -- Yeah, it was the white dragon you killed. Hi everybody. But we do need new gear. It takes time to make a -- So that’s like-- We have 1,000. Move two on that. I get it. Abacus!
