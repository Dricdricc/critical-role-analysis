Hi, Liam! Oh, is this a podcast now? (old-timey voice) Old time radio. Damn it. Ooh. It's pretty good, though, I like this better than the iPad. Yeah. How can we not see him? He's a mountain of man. I'm Rushmore. Right. Is that how it looks? So we have video problems? I'm Periscope-ing until we're not having video issues. Oh, we are? Okay. Bye, guys, we're live. Yeah, he texted. She's negged. You said the next few days without incident? Cool. I suggest against this. No. I'm against this. Are we nearing the destination? Get it out now. I think it looks good on you, Grog. Nice. I'm going to sense the weather, I suppose, because this doesn't look fun. Ooh, it's cold. I don't like this. Scanlan. Like we were discussing earlier, would you be interested in the still-standing trade of my Ioun Stone for your circlet-crown thingy? What would you like for lunch? I already ate. Well. Keyleth, if you could put a little slate up for me, I'd like to illustrate something for little Scanlan. And perhaps his tiny mind can comprehend it. (clears throat) Would you, perhaps, do this? I'm going to walk up to the hull and be like-- Oh. (clears throat) I see. Prestidigitation. Some chalk. You see, Scanlan, you've had this particular piece for over ten, let's say, matches or weeks. You have used it zero times. In over six battles, over the same course, using it zero times. (laughter) Which none of you can do. Other than monks, of course. When I can do multiple spells, like two, versus you, who can do one, that means that I can do one more spell than you can per round. (laughter) And every round after that. One hundred percent. (laughter) Your utilization of the actual item has been equivalent to nothing. In the interest of the group and the use of items in general, it would be wise to switch it, because you have needed extra spells like Invisibility-- Several times. Where my item would be more useful in general to you. Oh, me? Absolutely not. I am one of the strongest casters in all of Draconia, and it only takes the strength of my charisma to do my stuff. That is a movie. So, Scanlan. What say you? I don't like to show them off. Oh, wonderful. Thank you. (explosion sound) Now you can store up to three level spells. Three of them in there. And you don't have to expend spell slots to do the spells. You can put three Lightning Bolts in there and it costs nothing. I'm sorry. It orbits. It is fancy. Festivus. Oh. Good idea, yes. Of course, I will be your mage guard. (laughs) Oh. The tribes. Or maybe they got lost to the winds of the road. Oh, goodness. Which means "of course." Understandable. Ooh. Who was that person? Everywhere we go. It's everywhere we go. Why can't people be normal? I've never been here. And there's enough in the interim for a short rest from us getting from there to the last day to where we're at? Okay, cool. Awesome. No. (laughter) I'd have to take off my cloak, though, to wear that, right? I won't wear one. I keep my cloak on. Okay. Yay. It's like a little-- But I believe it's white, right? It's a white stone? Ah, there you go. I would like to look for any places-- oh, sorry. That's a long time to be out of Order. Sorry. I'm Tiberius Stormwind, and we are Vox Machina. Everybody has names, too. I'm going to look for any temples that might have a sigil inside while we're going through the town. I'll ask the Yonn guy. Right. Hm. Hm. Vonn. Yonn? Oh, Scalebearer Yonn, that's a fun name. (clears throat) As we travel through town, if you could point me to any place that would have a sigil of arcane-ness-- Oh. Ah. No, I'm fine! He's talking about other people. Oh of course I do, I'm a sorcerer. No, no, I think he-- sure. It's fine. I'm going to take it you don't see very many dragonborn in these parts. Oh. Yes. It's-- No, I'm of the chromatic nature, I'm a bit of an anomaly in my family, they're all of the metallic brand, I assure you. The Stormwind name runs true and wide throughout Draconia, but-- I cast Alter Self real quick and I turn myself into, I believe, gold. Because that's the red-- equivalent of red. On the metallic scale. I think that would be better for everyone involved. Oh, sorry. Thank you, thank you. I'll take the six. And I'm taking up the rear, following behind. Look, Percy, it's Draconic. See that, Scanlan? That says something like Apollo Justice something. It's maybe the rise of the justice of the phoenix. It's a lot of things. Is it lit in there? You're leaving? It is on the shiny die. I don't want it to be a hydra. Oh, that's right. Ooh. Is there a super clear one that she could try to go through first? (crashing sounds) Dammit! No. You're going to roll a one. (whispers) No, they'll probably just put her in prison. I think that's where you're going. Do I see her? Seriously? Again? Your Highness, what is your problem? The classic. The classic handcuff wrist twist. I nudge Grog. Grog, Grog, I'm nudging you. I'm just nudging you. Because Kima did something super hot. I would imagine. That's extra holy. (laughs) This temple goes to six. That is good, though. I take it all in and I'm reminded of one of the museums at home. The square things with all the paper leaves in them and squiggles. I read a lot of those. Can't put my finger on it. Unfortunately, yes. Well, yes. Will we have to contend with the defense systems as well? (laughs) Very good question. Right. (laughter) She gets it. She gets it. Like not around. Are we all potioned up, are we all-- We're good? (laughs) Burt Reynolds, you've done it again. It's dank down here. Oh! Light! Oh! (fssh) I de-cast Light. What is all of this poppycock? Oh, very good. Light! While we're standing around, I'd like to reassign the earrings to Vax, Grog, and Scanlan. Because we're always together, we're always kind of in the back together, and they're always kind of like up in the fray, so-- She's always kind of like in the middle. She's the wild card. He's always in the back with us also because we're the ranged dudes. Vax, check for traps! Oh, are we good? Okay. 18. Mm-hm. And I take half. So I take half. Is it 24 total? Oh. Oh! My robe. Are you getting used to your new foot, Vax? I'm going to Prestidigitate a tiny air shield in front of me. That's what I'm doing. Yeah. Oh, would you like to see? Yeah, very good. Light. Okay, or sigils or-- maybe we have to activate them or not activate them? What are you doing? I click my earring. You're an idiot, Vax. Yeah, 20! Okay, hold on a second, Vax, just chill out for a minute. We all just took a little damage this last time. So the goal is to shoot an arrow into this-- like the Death Star? Okay, cool. As I see her ready, I'm going to hold up my hand with my ring and point it right at that hole. I got your back. Get it, Vex. Oh, shit. I know. I cast Telekinesis to swoop it up. (whoosh) Just to help and guide it. It's going in there, anyway. I don't even have to roll. Sweet. That's 17. That was one of those impossible things, right? I knew it. Okay. Give me that chair. Yeah. We had points. We had points. Are we standing for this? Tell me that for the chat thing. Hi, everybody! Orion Acaba here and Taylor Carol. This is our special guest. And he's with GameChanger, and he has a couple of things to say for this particular awesome charity that we are working with today with SquareEnix and the Deus Ex anniversary. Yes. Yeah. That's awesome. And we here at-- And we here at Critical Role really love organizations like yours, which is why when we started talking, it was such a nice partnership for you to come on and tell us about this organization. Tell everybody where they can find to help, if they wanted to send to GameChanger. Yeah, where would they go for that, to check it out? Oh! Well, awesome. That's cool. I'll probably do that too. It sounds like it's pretty sweet. And I want to thank you, the rest, with all of us. I'm doing this because I'm currently fighting cancer. I have-- I don't have that bad of a trek to go through, but it is very inconvenient and painful, but hearing stories like you. I mean, you're 20. He has a beautiful singing voice. He's a singer. And you're going to Harvard, is that what's going on? Stupid doctors, they don't know shit. But people like you inspire me, because up until a few months ago, I didn't need any of that kind of inspiration. So it's great, and your organization's great, so we just wanted to thank you for coming on and speaking with everybody and letting everybody know, and we'll be working together in the future, too, and we'll be doing lots of fun stuff, so yeah. Check these guys out, please. Whoa. Hold on a second. Do you mean like you concentrate on English? Oh, very good. Okay, cool. That's like my second language. (laughs) Any other questions for our guest, guys? Yeah. So we can do that. Yeah, so that's what we'll do. Awesome! Right now. That's the decision. And this is our last day. Is that right? For the Deus Ex thing. Yeah. But again, dude, thank you for coming on. And we'll break because I have to pee really bad. But thank you so much. Nice! It is on. YES. Everything's so sticky. Are the spiderwebs-- are they becoming more as we traverse-- Okay, so I'm going to make my way towards the front of the group because I'm noticing this and I'm going to do a Fire Breath, and I'm going to instantly cast Control Flame and catch as much as I can of it, and start spinning it, burning the webs as we go. Mm-hm-hm. Fire cleans all. Sweet! (quietly, to Marisha) Is my magic on stealth, too? I back up! I have my cloak on. And I'm going to go ahead and cast Stoneskin. That's what I do right now. (quietly) Yeah, she's a ranger, she can cast stuff. Did I manage to catch with the Control Flame my entire Fire Breath when I did that? And I'm controlling it still? Cool. It's fine, just not in a hallway with stairs. As I see this, can I release my Control Flame and let the Fire Breath just happen, and not control it anymore? Okay. So that's what I was using, the element of what I did. So I used it so I could have the fire. Got it. Can I cast something else? Damn it! I know, but I like doing lots of things. What? 15. He just went to go poop. Or deal with-- He has a cat. Okay. (laughs) (mimicking Laura's gruff voice) MemememememeME. Ooh, yeah! Strategy. (laughs) Nice! Oh. Well, I mean, that's not out of-- Yeah, it's thematic. Cool. Wait. Can you do lightning? By the way, I'm here, but I'm also there. Cloak of Displacement. There's like two of me. Now damn plane spiders? Oh. So we're in a hallway, a stairwell? Is it like a big-- Oh. Very well. How many are left, two? Obelisk of Stone. Yeah, these squishy spiders. That's it. 21. 17. Sweet. Nice. I think I have two left. I need to get more. Oh, here we go. (pop) We've taken a short rest already, right? We're not stealing from this place. Nice. I'm going to check for any arcane stuff and I got-- I'm going to check for 25. Yeah. I'll keep close to the guards and the box. I know. I'm going to go use Greater Invisibility, as well. Because I can cast and still stay invisible. You're not dumb. You're a strong, smart person. Oh, your cards are cool! Nice, they have little bard thingies. Nice color diversity! (laughs) Oh, I did see this. I'd like to walk up as I see this going on. I'm going to take out my deck of illusions. I'm going to toss two cards both ways, two cards on each side. So I'm going to do this, real quick. Deck of illusions, everyone. Ten of Hearts, Yes! Joker, Queen of Hearts, and another Joker! What?! I put two on each side. Yeah. So, like, two over in the spot before all that mess over there and two are in the other mess. So the Jokers-- And a female version of me. (falsetto) Hello, everyone. (falsetto) Tiberiosa. And then whichever side you decide, a Queen of Hearts and Ten of Hearts. Queen of Hearts and a Ten of Hearts. (explosion noise) And they're positioned right before the messes of each side. Yeah. I invisibly follow right behind the box, still keeping my illusions in check. 17. I love light. I'm going to scootch. The guards could come back. Oh, nice, what? (whispers) Sweet, thorns. Good story? (laughs) I once fell into a fire ant hill. It was very painful. I was riding my bike. It sucked. Go. You heard the man! You heard him! You heard him! The earrings, everybody heard him. It's going to kill everything there. 13. (quietly) We all got above ten? Even Pike! Yeah, all right. Run for your life. Yes! 21! I'm going to dissipate my card illusion and I'm going to cast Fly on myself, so I'm hovering. I'll do support. I'll do Obelisk right behind it, too. 12. I thought it was negative three. Oh! All that work! Is Grog behind us now, like the furthest away? We're leaving! What are you doing?! Tell it to go kill the spider. I agree, Grog. Very well said. I'm actually okay. It's okay, big fella. Yes, surprisingly so. It went off without a hitch. Well, no. You're really a girl on fire now. Well done, everyone, by the way. Such a bore. It was a play on words. Your name also means something that you do when you're tired. Of course. I take a couple out. Yes, it's close, it seems. Before we part, you seem to be quite learned about many things that I am not. Have you ever heard of anything called the God's Hammer or the Pale Stone? Or any particular artifact, Ropes of Mercy, perhaps? Of course. Thank you. I bow. Yes, thank you for noticing. I agree with the same sentiment. And I bow in the Draconic fashion. Or you can stay here and restore it. (tearfully) You will be missed very much, Pike. You will be back. She will be back.
