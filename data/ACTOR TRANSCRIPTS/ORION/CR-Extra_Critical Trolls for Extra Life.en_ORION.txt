Hi, Liam O'Brien is an amazing voice actor. He's done a lot of amazing things in a lot of amazing projects. I'm DBM and your mind will be blown. I'm Orion Acaba, who is far less impressive, but also awesome. I'm a voice actor, also on Critical Role, who-- I was in Final Fantasy, okay? Do it. Double 20's. My name's Quaalude Methaqualone. Pleased to meet you. Wood elf, druid. Do things. Nice to meet you. Hi, this is my associate. Open mind. Free open mind. Free open mind, all of us. (mumbling) There's something about you... (unintelligible). I think it's... I think it's... I love what you're wearing, is what I'm saying. Eh? (mumbles) He cat. That's-- you're a lively bunch. What the hell's that? (yelling) We've been here quietly. As he says that, I'm going to take a special leaf pod that I have, and I'm going to pop a couple seeds. You want one? It's great. [jumbled] --it'll make you poop. Here, have some Asmodeum. What's going on? What's your name? Victor, welcome to the journey. I think you just call it a friend. You just call them friends. I say, I know the swamp. Whenever you have something show up and everything pops up it will reflect it back. Yes. It's the same thing every time. Or something. That's a good lad. That's a good lad. How far away? How far away are they? As I see this I'm like (mumbles) and I entangle them. Well then, they're tricky, sticky ones. 21. 21. 15. There's a-- so as he's coming towards us I'll-- I'm going to just do a spin like, hold on darling, (claps) and do a Thunderwave. And get thunder. Yes. Nice. What's that? Eight? You all right Edna? Oh good. 15. I'll be at the forefront. I'll use that roll for a 24. (Russian accent) No problem, I changed different accent, I sound different now, yes? I do not understand the reference. I'm so sorry for you. He's so much more aggressive than before, which I did not think was possible. 15. Where am I on the field? I mean to say (changes accent) where am I on the field? Oh. Wonderful. I look at what's going on and go, oh, I can barely stand this, and turn into a giant great big bear. Yeah, and it's a brown bear. And, first of all, I'd like to (bear noises) for a while and then-- All right, where's the Vox Moronica peeps? I'm going to bounce over to the goblin to my right. The bite misses. Right? Four. And the other one is 18. Seven damage. I'll turn to the other goblin and go, (roars). And then that's my turn. Uh. Yeah, if I can. Let's just move away from Salty Pete. I only have my bullshit. Oh, shit, okay. Let me shuffle-- that's fine, they're shuffled. So did that happen instead of the intelligence thing? And like four times the size, right? Don't kill the one next to Salty Pete. He has to take that one out. Four. Oh. Roar! And he's still on me? What is this, my dex? Okay, sure. Yeah. That's 1d8? Oh, five. Oh. Sweet. That made a big difference. Where's Edna? Let me go-- I have that chunk still in my mouth that I ripped off, yeah? I'm going to spit it in the goblin's face. Unicorn codpiece! Annihilation! He's dead! Whatever it is-- Yeah he did! He leveled up! He got to level ten! Ryco is-- I turn out of bear form. From that? I mean, by all means. Two. From your vagina? They always used to say, Charles would charge. Are you going to try it on? Does it make you younger? So it will make you a gross old man with low-hanging balls. That's not good. It looks like your name is Ed, now. I hang onto the chain-link fence. I look at playground. I don't know about you, but I'm quite happy with the results. You can call me Q. I go over to investigate. You want to come in? Is something wrong with your ear? What is a comm? You so crazy, girl. I love you. Let's go investigate, yes? I walk over. I see what is going on. I want to do an insight check. To see if I recognize any of the carvings or any of that stuff. Okay. That's 14. I guess we should explore ourselves. I recognize these things, eh, Snugglefoots? Come over here and look. It seems like there is some kind of G and S. Can I feel it? Is it open? When I hear that, I'm going to use my Mask of the Wild, and I'm going to blend into the side of the rock. Yeah, that'll work. That's a 19. Matthew? As position goes, I'm right there. Up against there, and yeah. And my Mask of the Wild, I look like the wall. That's what it does. 13. He has to make a melee attack. If you make him do something-- Call me Q. It's good. I'm going to shimmy a little bit along the wall, right before, and then I'm going to-- wait, no. I don't because I won't be able to move out-- Oh wait, I can split up movement! I can break movement! So I'll move-- am I still ten feet away from it? Okay, cool. So I want to get a little bit-- it doesn't matter because I'm going to spring out and turn into a direwolf (howling) and bite the shit out of it. I'm going to gain advantage because I-- Who's a wazza-bazza? No. Wait, wisdom. Four. Son of a bitch. You're here, Grandma. You're here. Isn't it, you have to keep singing as if you're in a musical? You have to keep singing in a musical, and then you gain up to level ten. When you stop, you lose that and you go to level five. (howling) Okay. What is it? Wisdom? 14. (singing) My wisdom is 14, dear DM. (singing) I'll tell you right now what I'm going to do! I'm going to jump up as the direwolf, and (snarling). (singing) Natural 20! (singing) Doubling damage, we're doubling damage, unh! That is four plus four, plus four plus four is eight! That means a 16! (singing) But not before I knock it prone! (singing) Hoping for ones, and a lot of them are all ones! (singing) Well the old gray mare, she ain't what she used to be, ain't what she used to be. (imitating a trombone) (howling) (singing) And I rolled a 14. I change out of beast form, and I straighten out my skirt, and I walk over to dead Snugglebaby and do a Cure Wounds. Wait, is--? What about blackpowder boy? What about Victor? Is he nowhere to be seen? Oh shit! Do I see him doing this? Because I back the fuck away. I quickly whisper, careful what you say! That is terrible. That is amazing! That is terrible. Yes, you did. Oh my god. I go to the nearest temple and get a spell of restoration to return me to at least half self. It's permanent? I don't do that. I go and get-- Fuck this. I'm going to finish this with some sass. I move to a different area and I just learned how to speak different, like the locals do. I got me a nice little dress and a nice little college with my earnings, and I just get one with nature is all. Little interesting fact, by the way, because we only did 70-- guys, last year, LA, Los Angeles, only raised about $113,000 alone, so we're-- us right now, tonight, are accounting for a lot of that, and I think we can hit the 70 as well. If we did 113 last year-- This is not canon. None of this is canon. Of course.
