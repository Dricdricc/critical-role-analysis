Tomorrow, Friday, on Gather Your Party, I had a thumbtack comedy buddy, Alex Lewis, and Keith Habersberger-- I know. From Buzzfeed. Together, they are Lewberger, and they're going to be playing here, and I'm going to be doing some songs with them and performing with them, as well. Check it out for Gather Your Party tomorrow. What time is that, sorry Zac? 700PM. I played that on Genesis. I'll take it. That's 20 for me. 20. 22. A what? Oh. Nasty things, these otyughs. Yes. They're not even there yet. Whatever you do, don't go up next to it right now. I can move first, right? I'll move around next to Kashaw. No, I'm not. Can I take a step back? Really? I thought I could move five feet. Okay. I won't do anything. Here's what I'm going to do instead. I'm sorry, I don't know what was wrong. I've been off, and I apologize for how I've been sounding. What I'm going to do is I'm going to lift my finger and I'm going to aim behind that three-headed bastard and I'm going to release a 4th-level Fireball. Yes. Behind him where it won't hurt Keyleth and will just hurt him. Wherever that is. I'm going to immediately spend two sorcery points and quicken spell, and I'm going to turn around and do three Scorching Rays to follow up the Fireball right at that dude, each head. I'm going to, on that spell, spend another-- Okay. 17. Wonderful, so let's see. Here's a six. Here's a five. Okay, so I'm going to now-- Hold on, I'm going to spend one sorcery point to empower the spell, and I'm going to pick the six and reroll these four dice, because I can reroll up to that many when I empower. For that damage. Perfect. What's the total for that, guys? What is that? Nine. That's 24. And then (counting). 48. So I'm going to do that. Okay, and then the Scorching Ray happens. And I'm going to heighten that spell, which gives you disadvantage against the save? Is that what I want to do? Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. Oh. Actually, I don't do that, then. I don't spend those points. I was supposed to do True Strike to make that work. d20s, right? Wonderful. Yeah, they all hit. I got a 14, an 18, a 19, and my spell attack bonus is plus 11. Ooh, that's gross, and I'm going to empower that spell, as well. So it's four, and I'm going to pick four out of these six-- no! I rolled a six. (counts quietly) 29. Yes, it does. Did you roll at disadvantage? Cloak of Displacement? AC is 18. 22. Yeah, that hits. This is fun. How much damage is that, total? Really? Plus the other damage? That's 16, so 26? 27. So what's half of that? Because of the Stoneskin. My Stoneskin is still up. Hour? I cast that when we were chasing him-- Okay. 13 points. Man, they can't touch me. I'm up in the air, yo. Aw man, I thought he was whipping me around. He's got me like this, right? Yeah, sure. I'm going to cast True Strike on him. Cantrip. On him. I'm going to look for a weakness. That'll give me advantage on my next-- Then I'm going to quicken spell and spend two more sorcery points to cast-- well, I'm going to look over. Can I see where Vax and him are coming? I can see behind the creature, though, because that's within range. So I will do Misty Step behind him and get out of that grip. Yes. As far away behind him as I can go. And that is my turn. Nope. Yes. I think he likes me! There's a bunch of rats down here! Stormwind. What the hell are we in? Is there a roof? What do I use? 15. No, 14. Okay. Well, I've got one right next to me, right? I'm going to put out my hand and I'm going to do a Firebolt right next to that one. Why, are they on me? Oh, right. Well, then I'm going to not do that. I'm going to cast Obelisk of Stone and then quicken spell and then I'm going to do a Firebolt. That's what I'm going to do. Yeah. About ten feet. And then I'll do the 2d10 damage. d10s. Here's one. Is it a d10? Do what now? Roll to hit first? Yes, thank you. Is that a spell attack roll? That's 31. Cool, so that's 11, so that's 16. What is that, 12? Oh, I'll do that. I Prestidigitate all the crap off. I think we've learned all we can from this one. I rolled a 23 arcana check on Thorbir's jeweled knife that he gave me. I agree. What was the ruling on the arcana check? The jeweled knife that Thorbir gave me. Kashaw. How close are you to your god? I don't. Oh. How is that, being married to a god? That's rather inconvenient. Ooh. So it's not like you can ask for a favor, I suppose. Yeah, and as this is going on, I dissipate the Light spell. 20. Are there torches down this hallway? Are there torches in this hallway? Yes. 21. I'll point to the one coming from opposite of Vax. That guy. And then I'm going to do True Strike on him. And I'll back away! That's good. That's my turn. Yeah, you should definitely-- Over here, Kashaw! 20? I take no pleasure in this. I cast Obelisk of Stone and crush them. Both of them. I'll move forward and then do it. Or as close as I can, as far away as I can see Vax. No, they take the damage. They're not pinned. They just take the damage. 31 points of damage. I'm going to spend two sorcery points to quicken a spell and then cast Scorching Ray right at it. (fire blasts) What is that? Oh, plus my spell attack. Okay, so 16 was one, 19, and 19. Two, four, six. Okay, that's ten and 15, and then 18, 23. That's negative. That's 16. I failed. Wait, he has to roll at disadvantage. Cloak. What's half of that? It's an hour-long spell. I can still hold another one and do a different one, and hold the other spell. That's 16? 17 points? Both daggers are magical? Okay, cool. That's actually great to know. I'm actually happy about that. Keyleth is right next to me, right? Vax is right next to me, also? Can I move, probably take a hit from him, and drag her with me? That's what I choose to do. Yeah, I'm going to pop one of my simple potions. Yeah. Okay. That's seven. Can I use the rest of my turn to help her up? All right, and that's my turn. Vex, no! Stop! What are you doing? That's what I said. I do not follow. I will go no further until I take a proper rest. I agree. We've been hit pretty hard, pretty quickly. You have those? What does that do? Are there bananas? What are dollars? Sure. Thank you, Keyleth. We're still on day one. Well, I'll tell you this, everyone. I have only a limited amount of spells left to be effective in a fight against a creature like this. I have no melee offenses towards this creature, whatsoever, so that's going to be up to you with magical weapons and whatnot, I'm assuming. I'm virtually tapped out of all my spells. So is the cleric, as well. So if we move forward, that's fine. We're only six hours in on the first day of this contract. I will follow the group. I'm fine. We have days left. (laughs) I like Johnny Kraghammer. Yes, I agree. I heard he was brave. Very brave. It is legend. As he's doing this, I cast Fly on Thorbir, Keyleth, the cleric, and Vax. And myself. I can cast it at 6th level. I'm terrible at math. Not Vax. Us four. Oh. Yes. Yeah. That Disney princess shit you saw was Lewberger, and they're playing tomorrow at Gather Your Party on this channel, and I will be performing songs with Alex Lewis, who's half of Lewberger, and I get to call Zac a dumdum for once. Zac the dumdum played the one video that I'm not in. Was through Alex, so he's the dumdum now. Sorry about that, for the confusion. That's what's going on. You'll see me dance like a monkey tomorrow. Oh yeah, we can all get on this one. Oh, natural 20. I am helming the damn magic carpet, of course. Natural 20. Are they infernal? I got ten, so I figured. I cast Fly on all of us. 16. 17. Don't worry about him. Is he a gnome? Get the carpet from him instead. I'll take out my Mending Wheel when I land, and grab the carpet. What, I'm fixing it! I'm using the Mending Wheel. I Prestidigitate it off, first. There. 18. It was a waste of fucking time. Let's press on. I'm cranky because I haven't slept, that's why. Yeah. Too bad, right? Nor does Tiberius. This is a death march. No, we can make it fly again. I cast Greater Invisibility. Our hand is forced. We are bound by contract. I do not personally wish to be here. What is this offer that you speak of? If that is your real name. I don't think it's a bad idea. That same guy? Five. Well done. 12. Rakshasa. Hold on, what is he doing? Is he casting a spell? 4th-level Counterspell. No. It shall not do nothing on my watch. How can he see me, by the way? I'm invisible, still. Bastard! Is that a spell? Do I recognize that as a spell being cast? Counterspell! Damn it! 19. None of our magical works against-- you know what I'm going to say! I'm speaking Draconic again, sorry. (laughter) Okay. Fine. I'm going to attempt to cast Slow on both of them. 40-foot cube, 120-foot range. Center it where it won't hurt anybody else except for them. Actually, I think I can pick who I affect. And that's what I do. Slow down. I think that will affect the rakshasa. 17. 21. Cool. So now it takes a negative two penalty to its AC and its dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. Sweet. And I move as far away from everything as I can. That's what I do. What happened? Is a spell being cast? Oh, Counterspell. 4th level. Shut up. I'm trying to save you. Take a potion. Did you say "clow?" Move me in sight range of both of them. As a good sorcerer would be positioned. I'll cast Silence right in the center of the room. Yep. Not hitting Kashaw. And I sit in Indian-style position. Now cast stuff, butthole! I dissipate my Greater Invisibility spell so it can see me. I can do that, too! Good job, Lara! I mean, Vax. What's above us? Okay. Any light coming down? I'm going to cast Obelisk of Stone. Rakshasa! The butthole. And smash the shit out of both of them! 20 feet high. Maximum height. It's a dex save. So he's pinned to the ceiling, and they both take 21 damage. WILL and Right. That means they don't get pinned by it. All right. And he's pinned. I look at him, and I'm like-- Oh, because of the Silence. I'll dissipate the spell so I can hear him. Were you trying to say something, Thorbir? 4th-level Counterspell! Yeah, and I have two stored in there. No. I can carry five up to 4th-level spells. It's my Ring of Spell Storing. It can carry up to five spells that go up to 4th level. I don't understand that. That's not how it worked before. Yeah. Still 4th-level Counterspell. As a matter of fact, no. 6th-level Counterspell. (growling) You will go nowhere! That's far as I can go. Do I have advantage or anything? Okay. 19. 19. (shouting) No one threatens a goddamn Stormwind! I think I just broke my hand. (laughter) Is it behind us? Yes, of course. That's exactly what I was going to do. I'm taking some of the blood, for sure. Filling some vials. I'm going to take my dagger out, and I'm going to shave trimmings from his fur and his whiskers. I'll take those. Very good. We have to break through those first. Fireball, fireball, fireball. Breaky, breaky, breaky. I had a bottle of air! I turn around and go like, you really don't want to do that, friend. Trust me, please. Oh, what is that? 14. (garbled) Draconian again. (laughter) One more insult, madam, and you will find your whole establishment on fire. I'm not in the mood. Oh. Well, in that case, I take it as a compliment. I need a bed. And I motion towards the thing. I'm sleepy. It has been a pleasure and an honor, Kashaw. You as well, Thorbir. You are brave warriors and would do well in the Draconian Knights. He said my name right! It's mind-boggling. And our warlock. (cheering)
