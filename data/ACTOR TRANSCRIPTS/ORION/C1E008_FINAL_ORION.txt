I'm going to spoil the movie for everybody they win! TALIESIN AND I didn't say who 'they' were. It's like asking the future. Who cares. Plus ten. (Dwarven accent) What the hell is going on? (Dwarven accent) Whoa. What happened to all the other little dwarves? Well, this is just how I sound. (Dwarven accent) Oh, great. No, I could change back anytime I want, but I really like how I look. (all laugh) (Dwarven accent) Clarota, what do you think we should do? I knew you were going to say that. A different option. Oh, and thank you, Pike. But Kima does. Pike, you can do it one more time and take a little rest, right? Do you know where she would be at? Wait a minute. What happened to your toe? Oh, that's fun. (Dwarven accent) Ooh, like a little gopher. That first part of what you said rhymed. Sweet. That's great. If you can mention that to Allura, that'd be wonderful. (mumbles, makes spell sounds, returns to normal voice) I would really appreciate it if you mentioned that to Allura. I'm trying to get into her good graces and whatnot. We share something in common, Lady Kima. I, too, have left my home and land because I did not want to sit on the council of Draconia. With blessings from my father and such, I gained ambassadorship on a mission for them, but really, just so I could-- To get all the things out, and I saw this wonderful lamb in this field one time-- Yes, I think so. She's royalty, you have to understand. I pop out of my sleep. Did you say Allura again? I'm sorry. I relieved myself in the middle of the night. I did my dragonborn business and buried it. As we do. Put some Greater Restorations in there. I take out my Ioun Stones. Well, I only have one. Sorry. Pathfinder habit. 29. 29. Or they're dragging his body. Shall we? It's so good. It's humid still? Humid. So we're past that. Oh, Light! Oh, yes, of course. I'm going to make an arcana check, also. 11. For arcana. Just general, if I feel a general source of sinister magic anywhere. Bone petals. Well, let's keep moving, then. Yes, I know where you're going with this, and we'd all have to make a certain-- (mumbles) Shoot an arrow, if you would, Vex, please? Wherever you wish. Light! Grand Columns is the spell, Vex. Multiple times, I guess. Hold on a second. I've got something here. Lady Keyleth, if you will, could you perhaps make a flat, sturdy stone tablet we could all particularly stand on. Make sure it's under a hundred pounds, if you could. Or actually, two hundred pounds, a little bit more to work with. Everybody, hop on. Wait a minute, how much does Trinket weigh? I don't have that spell anymore. I need to know how much she weighs for this. So here's the situation. I can get us all across, but I cannot take Trinket as well. That's it, yes! Very good. Make him into a chicken. I motion over to Pike and I take her medallion slowly off of her and go-- and bring out my Mending Wheel. No, I held that. What? I thought it was like this big. I forgot we didn't have it. In Draconia, those are snacks. I cast Telekinesis on the stone slab, lift us up, and push us. A thousand. I did all the math. (clears throat) Vax weighs 155, Pike weighs 75. Taliesin weighs 190, Vex weighs 120. Sam weighs the same, 75. Keyleth weighs 125. Yeah, should. Is that right? That's why I kept a hundred pounds for that. Nine. Nope, we're at nine-- we're there. We're at nine-something. You can do all the math, but it's nine-something. Ten minutes. I hover about-- what's bone break?-- around six feet above the air. That's how high I take it. In front of us? We hear this. I push us forward. I mean, we're going in that direction anyways, so I speed us up. Cool, so I get a little bit more control over it now. (grunts) Avoid! (whooshing sound) Do I see it? Can I see it as I'm cruising through? I see him? As soon as I do that, I cast True Strike. (ftsssh) On him! What it does is, it allows me to see--keep going, I'll tell you. Go ahead. I'm still going! We're still going. I'm not standing and watching. Yeah, well, that's the thing. By the way, Matthew. True Strike. I extend my hand and point a finger at a target. My magic grants me a brief insight into the target's defenses. On my next turn, I gain advantage on my first attack roll against the creature, using that spell as a guide. 18. Before that ends I go, hop off. Okay, everyone hold on tight. How wide was the stone tablet? Ten feet for all of us to fit on? Perfect, I move us right above the butthole and, everybody hold on. And I fucking slam all of us right on him. (boosh) Me too? 12. Wait, do I make a dexterity check? I mean I'm not-- okay. Can I not do any bonus actions? Okay. Okay. 17. (counting noises) What is that, 19. Nice! No. 17. No! My big toe! Bah! I swing at it with my cane as I'm on the floor. Nice. Is he blind? Yes. I look around, and I don't like what I see, and I try to get up. Really? Okay, where's he again? All I see is mountains. Oh, I see, you put the yellow ring around him? And Kima's to the right of him? Oh, okay. Great. I look at him, see what's going on. I (ping) my Ioun Stone, and I conjure out Telekinesis from it, and I guide it towards the monster's tentacle to unwrap it off Kima, and I attempt to pull it off her. Sweet! 20. Can I also go like, (bash) Stop hitting yourself! (all laugh) I give a nod to Kima. That's my turn. Kima? MATT AND What's your movement? I look at Scanlan curiously. (laughs) He's sad for a while. (laughs) Negative two to self-esteem. Nice! Holy crap. They are. I would say probably. Okay. I assess the situation, and I don't like it. No. I cast Watery Sphere on him, and try to capture the guy in my sphere. That is-- oh, plus this! (gasps) Oh my god, I always forget it's that number. It's 27. 18 plus nine? Yeah. I was looking that up, too. 17. Does it do damage? Ugh. All right. That's my bad, I shouldn't have-- Well, fine. I can still move it, yes? She's got this. I'll move it over just to make him all soak-y in it anyway. It's not going to-- I can't move him. It doesn't control him, right? Well, fine. I don't do that. I spend-- I don't do anything, actually. That's my turn. I see what's going on. I cast Telekinesis (fssh) and start pulling it up. Oh my god. Arcana? 12. I'll do an arcana check on that, and I already got 22. Prestidigitation! Clean that up. I'll inspect them. Let's see. 13. Translated, it's Bracers of Archery. You should check it out. Actually, wait a minute. Hold on a sec. My water sphere is still there, isn't it? I'm going to take it and push it along our way as well, in front of her who's swinging it as well. Push it up to 30 feet. In front of her. Just a nice little (pssht) like 30 feet from where we are. Ooh! Vax just said we should go! Female viewers, absolutely. Absolutely, I would agree. We did! Follow us on Twitter, and then help us. Yeah, we're working on it. Good luck! Thanks bud, I'll take all the credit for that one. Thank you, Katya. Thank you. Thanks Aldowin. It's Orion, Zac. Chatroom, accost him for that, please. (laughing) Yeah! Actually, me and Alex Lewis / I8athumbtack are doing more music videos and funny stuff. Thank you for asking. Absolutely. He watches it all the time. I've already put my request into Hot Pepper-- I've done one before. I think I had the grossest HotPepperGaming.
