Yes I am. In fact you and I-- We do something together, I don't know what. Or you're playing a version of me or something, I don't remember. (laughs) The director told me something about you and I just assume we're probably having sex in the game. Yeah, okay. He'll be here. What's dumb? So, like, tomorrow. I add 20 to this, right, that's how it works? See you guys in-- How many spells does he get? See you guys in like an hour. I got a four. Oh, yeah. I save it for when it counts. You're just going to start shooting. You're just going to start shooting. What if you could reason with him? No, it's going to be fine, guys. We're like a-- The valley is like a taco shell. Yeah, it's like a taco shell and we're the meat. Maybe it doesn't do math well. Maybe it doesn't know math well. Maybe it doesn't move right. I approve of that. Wait, that means-- 66? What?! Whoa. Grog is always in the way. Angry d10. Burnt fur. Oh, snap. Ooh. Oh. Trinket's not worth second level? I would've done a cantrip. 25. That's a thing? Oooh. (gasps) Is that, like, "Break glass in case of emergency"? (laughs) Oh, great! Hope I'm right next to you. Ah. Woo. What does it do? Too hot to handle, too cold to hold. Do I have to heal Trinket anymore? Okay. Then I will-- (laughs) Let's see here. Do we want to get him away from us, or do we want to hurt him? Let's do-- Well, I don't hurt things very well. (laughs) Okay. I'll do some Bigby Hand. I summon Bigby's Hand. (sings) Bigby's Hand! (all laugh) It's in front of me. I can't make it go in front of him? Okay. Okay. Well then, I do one of these, the Sugar Ray Leonard. I do this-- (all laugh) And I'll just punch him in the face. Right? Because I can do the-- It says huge or smaller creature, at least with Grasping Hand. Is that only-- does that count? So the Clenched Fisht, Clenched Fist. Clenched Fisht attack, Money Penny. (laughs) Nope. (all laugh) 13. Oh boy. (laughs) I'll take a step to my left, so I'm not in the same line of fire as Percy. And I'll also inspire Grog. (sings) He's Grog, he's Grog, he's big, he's strong, like wood. He's better than bad, he's good. (all laugh) Just say, "Your soul is forfeit," just for coolness. (all laugh) Oh shit. We did great. (laughs) Whoa. What's Trinket doing? Oh shit, does it hit Trinket, too? (noises) Who said that? Who said that? You hit once. Just keep rolling 22s. It was halfway between two. 15. Nice! Nice! He has a glaive? Oh! What, that's just the first dagger?! Oh! This is unusual. I still have my Bigby's Hand up, so I do one of these where I say, oh, a wise guy, see? (taunting noises) and I just poke him in the eyes. 19. 4d8. 19. I hide behind Trinket, the smell of smoldering fur in my nose. As a bonus action, I will-- who's up next, who's coming soon? Is Percy next? I'll inspire Percy. Just doing this move-- Going, pour some Scanlan on you! When you need a hand! That's all I've got. And I get closer. Pour some Scanlan on you! Do I lose another spell for that, or is that just the same--? Okay. Don't shoot me. Did he misfire again? No. What is he doing? What is he doing? We broke the DM. Here comes the other three. Fire slap! With inspiration. With inspiration. Okay. Oh, thank you. Giant gnome? Yes! I use Bigby's Hand to stop the hammer. It's over. It's over. MARISHA and Think of the beard. Did it have a cave? A behir? She gets advantage because mountains are her favorite terrain. Don't eat it, Grog. He's up a hill. Let's get out of this little taco in case that was the daughter of something else. Oh? We should still go. He's a weird loner, that guy. Oh. Don't leave. It's very much in his character. Can I just bump into Vex and ask her to maybe scan ahead for dragons? Dragons, though. Six miles. Don't you have six miles of dragons or something? Thank you. Six miles of dragons. Could be dragon eggs. Listen. When I poo somewhere, I can see everything. She usually buries them quite well. All right. We're not? At least we're not going north. We're going to just keep going towards the town. Like, designed by man? He doesn't know the-- Wait, should we-- those are bad guys, right? We should not go that way. We could stealth through it, we could invisible through it. I have some invisibility. Not great, though. What kind? Are we a mile away? A thousand feet away? What does that even mean? I don't speak your language. It would block their view of us maybe? Perhaps? That would keep them in their fortress. I put on my climbing gear, which I definitely own. And it was the same. (laughs) What am I doing? Adding what? Athletics. 11. Disadvantage. Of course. It's an honor system. 17. They could be dead in there. (sings) There are giants in the sky. You want me to go in? You're going to bird in? They're going to see you fly in. It doesn't matter, they're still gonna see you. Come on, oh yeah. A slope. A siggle. Call us in. Split level condo. Yeah, let's go check in. Oh! I'm going to go downstairs. Oh. Down the grade, I mean. Shall I for downstairs? 23. I give it to Vex. I take it. Nothing, nothing. I'll use it as a hammock. I took the potion, I took the potion! It's probably not in effect anymore. I inspired him quite a while ago. How long does that-- 20 minutes? I'm still down there, investigating. I pull a David Caruso and say, It looks like these giants had... big trouble. (all laugh) Kill them all. Don't worry, we still have the element of surprise. Oh wait, no, we don't. There's the city! Shall we storm it? Maps! Don't. Just don't. This is the castle, this is the town? So knowledgeable, Percy. To the town, or to the castle? Watch from afar? What's that going to tell us? Or both. It could be all vampires. Or it could be a totally normal town. How far away are we? Is it nighttime? Oh. That's scary. We're just hiding in the trees, we're not going in to investigate? How long would it take to get into the town from where we are? Ew. We'll get there at night. That's all right though, it's early evening. Vax. Can I ride you into town? Well hello lady. Yeah, I guess I could fly. Whatever you're into, baby. (laughs) I've become Austin Powers. What about this I'll make us both invisible and you fly us in. Looking. Up to an hour. Ooh, and it takes two hours just to get there? How long can you be Polymorphed for? Forever? Concentration? Okay, so you fly us in, and I'll Invisibility us right as we get to the gates. Except for Trinket, who can't climb up. You have to roll for Trinket. If she was a little older, Tiberius would kill her. (all laugh) Yes. Oh, shit. Can I do one of these? Damn it! Ooh. No problem. You want to set me down so I can go talk to people? Well, or at least eavesdrop. We don't know if they're all vampires or not. I'm just going to walk down there. I won't be able to see you, so I'm going to leave a little-- I leave a little, like a canteen or something, right where she's perched, just so I know where to find her. Yeah, my stein. And then I'm going to walk down and see if I can stealthily eavesdrop on some conversations. Oh, shit. Am I going to fall? Athletics? 17. It took me 12 minutes to climb 25 feet? Nice. I suck. Oh shit, I have to do this quick. He's doing walla. (all laugh) Wait, wasn't that one of the people-- Okay. I'm going to hustle back to the roof. Jesus. Eight. (all laugh) No, it's nine. I want to spend the night here. No. I will sneak around the corner a little bit, wait for an opening, and I lose Invisibility, which will drop it on her as well, and I will Dimension Door back up to the roof. Grab the canteen. Oh, shit. Invisibility again. Sky sentinel, what does that mean? Every time you use it, or is at a one-time-- Thunder! I don't know. (imitating Clarota) I'm on your head. What if we fall out? Before we slumber, we did a little intel, a little recon. Turns out the town is full of humans, except for these six vampire giants-- zombie giants. However, this could be useful. Everyone in the town, the farmers anyway, seem to be gathering produce to deliver to the Briarwoods. We could pose as some sort of farmer troupe with a basket of goodies, and maybe get through the front gate. We could make ourselves look like some of them. One of us has a hat of disguise. What? Oh, yes, this. It's really lovely. I don't know, maybe it gets sun. That's a lovely story. And now it's being used as a-- Who that? Why would they make camp in the place where the god of the sun-- Are any of us religious with that god, or--? I can at least see what she is up to. What would that do? We're not religious people. We can't summon the gods willy-nilly. I'm sorry. We can do all of those things. Yes, let's go in the middle of the vampire-infested town and do some arbory to try to heal the tree, and then we'll just say, oh, sun god, please rain down sun here. That's a great plan. We could. Won't they know we're here? Won't the people see us doing things? That's true. But we still have to get in. I know, I know. Are you sure you don't want me to be a carriage driver, and you'll hide in the hay of my carriage and I'll go straight up to the Briarwoods. I will put on my hat of disguise, I will be someone completely different. So while he was transparent, they saw through him? I'm not talking about getting past the Briarwoods. I'm talking about getting past the guards that guard their castle. But then what? Once the tree is healed, we have no one of religious power to summon any god. We don't know anything about this god, none of us do! Me? I am the antithesis of faith. And then what? We're going to fight off a million monsters to heal a tree, and then we're going to say, "Okay. Bring out the sun," or something. Does it involve healing the tree? We're going to be insurgents? I kind of love this. Make a pipe bomb. Like a mark? Like our mark. Like our mark. The resistance. I need a beret. (all laugh) Can I do a quick scry back to the poo jar that I left back in our kitchen? Just to make sure that our home base is okay. So they're fine. So I knock that one off, and I'll try for Pike. They wiped my poo away. Which some could argue is magical in its own right. Only one way to find out. Sure. Sure. I could get in, shit in their bedroom, and leave. Oh, yeah. That, too! Pull the pin. (all laugh) Yes? And then we'd have eyes in there. I like this a lot. Give me something to eat. I need some fuel. Sweet potato? That's good, yes. Some prunes? Wait. So that we can be townspeople. Right? We're setting up shop. Percy is known here. But they're not on sentry duty. We also have the hat. His hat of disguise. Percy knows this town. Perhaps Percy should wear the hat. Just a few minutes, I think. Yes, you had it from the dinner party. Before we go marching in there, finding an abode to live in is not going to be too difficult. We'll need food. Yes. We might be there for days and days. We also have to go around town and, forgive me if I'm going too far with your plan here, but aren't we trying to win allies among the people? But we'll need to communicate with them. How? (sighs) All right. Wait, we're just going to walk into the city? Okay. Beard check? Grog, I've heard that no one in this town wears a beard. I rub dirt all over my face. You should try to look less handsome. Okay. We've got Pass Without a Trace, so 28. We're all going together. What's illusion magic? Sure. All right. I will cast Seeming on us. We'll all look like dirty-- -- dirty, ragged peasants. Can I just say this? Can we just leave Trinket behind-- I don't want to walk in there with a bear! I think I can only make us all look the same. Oh, wait, no! You can give each target a new appearance. So I can make everyone look a little different. Okay. He's a milk cow. All right. Donkey. He's an ass. I make myself look like a weird hunchback, sort of, not all there. We're not gonna live in a cemetery, that's super creepy. We're trying to shoot for here? You speak Giant, Grog? Oh, we're gonna walk by the tree? Nine. Wait, what? Is that us? They killed people they thought were us, or they killed-- Or it's a message to us. Oh shit. You mean in town? Of course they are! Holy shit. Body of my guy. Is he sort of handsome? Oh, it was a child? Oh, god. A week? That's before we set out. They assumed we would come, but they don't know that we're here. This was a week ago, this was before we were even close. Let's go find a building. 30 feet? What about 150? Maybe underground stuff. Are you guys going in? Wait, not now. Not now. Let's find a place first. Yes. I'm gonna look for a brothel! (all laugh) Ooh! Or to drink. I can make her invisible if she can talk to the tree. I can make her invisible. We can burrow under, we can-- -- find something closer. Well, there are windows on the first floor, right? I'm gonna just find some old rags, or anything I can find, tablecloths, and just cover the windows. True. We use the wine. Maybe there's a simpler way. Speak with Plants? I can go to one of the wells and get some water. Oh no. Dead?! You can do that? You can bring dead things back? What?! This I gotta see. Yeah! LIAM, LAURA, and Is it going to be loud? I'm going to get provisions ready to spoon-feed her. Not a lot. This is great. This is awesome. Wait, forever? 2d12? What the fuck is a d12? I've never rolled a d12. Why don't we do that right before we go see the Briarwoods, also? Because that is fucking awesome. The tikka masala was tangy! We're not starting any fight, we're forming an insurgency. Wow. And the tree was happy. But not really. The what? Wait, maybe the decimal place was wrong?
