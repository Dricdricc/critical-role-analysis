Are they going to run out again? Are these #2 pencils? Could someone take the SAT with my "Doty, take this down" pencil? Whoa, that's so amazing! Is that true? TALIESIN and For us? We're just a bunch of nerdy-ass voice actors. Whoa. But surely it will be in the store afterwards? Just exclusive to the live show? I have some notes on the cover. Oh shit. No, I got nothing. We step forward. Are we on the edge of the bowl? Is she in the bowl and we're on the edge of the bowl? Are we going to go into the bowl? Take a tumble. O mighty Ioun, we are here to ask you for help, for a great danger. You might already know this, but a great danger has befallen the world. There is one who has come from another plane to become a god himself, Vecna. For all we know, he may already have achieved godhood, but he's well on his path. We're gathering the strength right now. Some among us have already-- the one who's making weird faces has already sworn allegiance to another god. (whispering) She knows everything. Not to question your infinite knowledge and judgment, but my stories are more of little bar room tales and silly poems to pass the time. I would hardly call them epic histories of civilization. I'm really powerful. It's my best asset. If you have faith in me, I will have faith in you and trust you and your knowledge. And I will try to complete any task you ask of me. There's a tome that contains the incantation of what? TRAVIS, LAURA, MARISHA, and They're spectral? I'm going to go try to talk to one of them. Hello, sir. Do you have language? Can you speak? Can you help us find a book? It contains an Incantation of Isolation. Or about the Chained Oblivion. No chance. Wait. Before we start flying around, what do we know? When was this last used, this book? 886 years ago or whatever, right? 812 years ago. Well, it's 812 P-whatever. PD, right? So 812 years ago. So we're looking for a very old book that was used by Ioun? Who was it used by? So it's some sort of a wizard's or sorcerer's tome? Is that the language they used before the-- So we need to find one that's not a name of a person. Are they dead? So there's a book that says Pelor on it? Or Ioun. Or Dawnfather. Hey, Percy, are these books arranged in any order? Chronological, name, anything? Oh, you didn't see anything when you looked? Interesting. Wait, so it's like a mirror image, the top and bottom? What if that line is the demarcation between pre-Divergence and post-Divergence or something like that? I can't. I'm going to take a look, but I'm going to pull out my Ioun stone and clutch it in my hand and close my eyes and pray on it for a second. Hope that guides me in some way. Religion check. Okay, well, that's terrible. I don't have Luck. I can inspire myself. I will inspire myself with a little song. (singing) Scanlancito, he's got tiny feet-oh, but he likes to cast spells, he does it with his beat-oh. When you go to sleep-oh, better check your sheet-ohs, because after he eats-ohs, he likes to take a shit-oh! (laughter) That's a 12. So that brings it up to 21. Okay. Whoa! On behalf of the Mistress Ioun, I speak in her name. And I'll hold up the stone. Well she tasked me; it's not a lie! She tasked me with this. We seek a book. We would love some help, and it contains the Incantation of Isolation. Maybe about 812 years old-ish. Maybe 813? I have to sing it? Oh, okay. I pull out a sword. (sword unsheathing) Okay. (singing) Just take a look, it's in a book, the Scanlan rainbow. I can read anything. (singing) I sing to you in desperation. I'm looking for a Tome of Isolation. We need to find a tome, so we can go home and kill a guy named Vecna. It would really make us... Nothing rhymes with Vecna. 29. (yells) What? It's a library; keep quiet. I don't know my history. 23. Okay. I'm just going to keep talking, I guess. (rapping) The book we're looking for is fraught with insanity, It dates back to the time of Calamity. It's about a guy with oblivion chains. You know his name. (laughter) Okay, Sprigg, I got it. (singing) If we don't act soon Vecna might just wreck ya. (speaking) I got it in there for you. Oh yeah. Wait, what? (whispers) Oh my god. (singing) The book is eight centuries old, or so I'm told. It's fraught with mystery. It's teeming with history. So please listen to me and don't kiss me because I really need this book right now. No. 22. I will do one more. I hope it works. I'll recite a poem. This little gnomey went to the heavens. This little gnomey wants to go home. This little gnomey is looking for a book. This little gnomey is trusting Ioun. This little gnomey wants to go wee-wee-wee-wee all the way to this tome. (cheering) Natural 20. (cheering) Oh. (singing) Can you open it up? Wait, they can pick books. I'm going to inspire her. (singing) I'm so vain. I probably think this song is about me. I'm so vain. Wow! It was the inspiration! There are DCs up to 30?! Sure, I'll blacklight it. I'm going to quickly scan the books to see if any of them look particularly old. Not much! Gnome, Marquesian, and Common. And then what? How many minutes are left, and how far are we from our friends? We could take them all back and see if anyone can read. The one that has nothing on the binding. Can I open that and flip through real quick? This is the thing. I do not. Okay, sure. Sure. I'll sing to a book, Matt. (singing) Read to me of times gone by. Can it be you're here when a bunch of gods died? (speaking) Okay. That's all I got. Don't tell anyone I sang to a book. Let's get back. Are you sure? Hold it upside down. I'm going to listen to it. 13 plus five, 18. Plus Jack of All Trades. 21. What spell? I don't want to hurt it! Okay. I'll place Mythcarver on it. I don't know what to cast on a book! I'll cast Friends on it. Sure. Not good. Strength? Ten. Write in the book? No! I've never watched Harry Potter! I must have a quill, right? I'm a storyteller. Okay, I'll pull out my quill. Jesus. While we're flying? This seems like a bad idea. This is a bad idea. No! How about when we land? No. It absorbed the spell and seemed to like it, but nothing happened. I have the Ioun Stone, but it doesn't do anything. Oh, that's 17. I'll try to cast a more powerful spell into it without hurting it, though, that's the thing. If I do Lightning, what if it burns the fucking book? I'll do Thunderwave on it, right? Yeah. I'll Dominate Monster, that's a super high-level spell. Eight. I don't know, what language is it?! It's a notebook! It's somebody who was figuring this out as they were writing it! Yes, I have a beautiful mind! (laughter) Do I see any words that say isolation or incantation or anything? I like to read things and really understand. It's a cookbook. Yeah! Let's go down to her bowl. All right, so let's go down into the bowl and wait for her to arrive. I heard when you yelled it. It was the "Neck, Ma," that I couldn't come up with a way-- I wish you would have been chosen by Ioun. I casually blow the hair out of my face and walk over to her and say, O mighty goddess, it was a challenging challenge, but I think you'll be pretty happy with the results. As I hold up the book, I'll cast Wrist Pocket and make it disappear. Oh god, oh it's gone! Just kidding. And it's back. This is what we've found for you. I hope it pleases you. You know, we didn't actually look at the other ten books. Yes. With conviction, I firmly believe that this is the correct book. Can I still see the writing? I'll cherish it always. Is it cool or is it gross? TRAVIS and Chicks will dig? Okay, I gain plus two to my intelligence! Whoa! As a bonus action, I can channel the omniscience of Ioun. For one hour, whenever you successfully hit a creature with a spell or attack, you can learn one of the creature's stats of your choice from the following list AC, senses, saving throw bonuses, damage resistances, damage immunities, damage vulnerabilities. During this hour, you also have advantage on initiative rolls and on saving throws. Once this ability is used, it cannot be used again for a week. Okay! Just one. The tome As an action, I can expend a spell slot of any level higher than three, thank you Travis. The cover and the pages glow of secret text of the Rites of Prime Banishment. While legible, you can spend an action to invoke the Rites of Banishment against the target. The target must make a wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is banished and sealed and this book is immediately teleported to the Endless Atheneeum. On a success, the text becomes blurred until the end of your next turn. On a success. On a failure of their saving throw. Right, yeah? Got it. Then, after that turn, I can read it again? DC ten. A wisdom saving throw-- oh! That's key info. Plus five to DC for each Divine Trammel fused to the target. We've got to be matadors and attach a bunch of pegs to the thing before we deliver the killing blow. We'll be picadors, right? They put the darts on the back of the bull to soften it up and (whoosh) killing blow! No, I think we're done here, guys. Yes, so many! I don't think. What are the odds, right? Different sword. Me? Thank you, Sprigg, for everything. We've only known you a short time-- No, you've taught us much in a short time, and I'm sorry that we broke your house, but it seems like you've found a suitable replacement. Oh, yes. 24 of them. I will remember. Until next time. The cabin? You mean Sprigg's cabin? Why would we go there? Who? I'm sure he's fine. Let's just go to Whitestone. Oh, it's the shackles. We're going for the shackles. But she said the timetable is shortened. We have to find this place in the middle of the ocean. Wow. It was a pleasure. We know you just came on this show so you could get onto Talks. But we'll take it anyway. I did, too. If I may, Matt? Music level, split the difference. We're basically gods. (laughter) Crudite? Crudite? (laughter) Who, me? A moment alone, please. My cube? You want to see it? All right. Didn't you do this before with the other one? Didn't you try to squish it or something? Swallow the bean? Sure. All right, I will mime swallowing the bean while I Wrist Pocket it. Five. I trust you 100 percent, Grog. My stomach exists. I leave all of my worldly possessions to you, Grog. Ordinarily, yes, but not today. (laughter) Exactly. How did they know we were here? Why did you just kill the assassin guy that we were going to ask? Who are you? Whispers? You know what, guys? I didn't know that this was ever a thing. We've thrown out so many cool ideas on that text thread. I get asked for personal quotes all the time. Right now? I don't think so. Raven Queen or the mansion? Sure. Probably us. Do you want me to disguise you? Take this hat-- Fuck! All right, I'll cast Seeming on you. On all of us. Because I can. Blue and a foot smaller, like Blue Man Group. Black clothes, blue face, bald. I think he's dead. I think he died in there. He's undead, isn't he? He's a zombie. (whispering) He can breathe blood! This has been the craziest 48 hours of my life. (laughter) Wow. I could've just been chilling... How do we get to the forge? There's no trees there. It would be great to have a fourth bean, but we're on a ticking time clock. Blockbuster? Errol's Video. You're still blue, and you still look like Blue Man Group, so do you want me to go with you so that I can undo that when we get there? Or do you want to talk to him blue? But when you talk to Groon do you want to be blue? So I'll come with you. Am I making a mansion for the rest of you? All right. Mansion. Enjoy yourselves. I'll don the hat so I turn into the Meat Man so that no one can recognize me. I think he's a little bigger. (Meat Man voice) The Sword of Kas, yes. The thought did occur to me, yes, but there are big differences. Well, Ioun did not talk about a talking sword, for one. Do you think we should go get it to make sure? We should have asked for some sort of identifying feature. She said, "Do you have any more questions?" You want to go visit Craven Edge? I held the sword once. I have a thing for Craven Edge, as well. Intelligence check? 11. Eight plus two, plus one is 11. I mean, do I get to add my Jack of All Trades? 14! It was a very powerful sword, but perhaps it's worth a check. How do we get there? We'll have to talk to Keyleth about it. Or it's just a sword. We'll ask Keyleth when we get back. She knows how to get there. He's blue. I will drop the form of Grog. Can we come in? I am a legitimate businessman. For business dealings. I shouldn't have said anything. (laughter) If you ever need any antique furniture or decor, ask for the Meat Man. He get you good deal. (clicks tongue) I can't do it again. I guess I could do it one more time, sure. This time, I make us all blue. Dark blue skin, light blue hair? Sure. I'll be opposite. Episode title The Blue Job. (laughter) It's vegan here. We serve a lot of beans. Yes. She's always here in my heart. (noises of surprise) I just rolled a two. Whoa. That was impressive. Ysgard. No. We can ask. Who was the other band of travelers who fought and lost? Where is it? Ugh. What kind of dumb character keeps a diary? What are we doing? That's low priority. I don't think that's the thing. Just because it's a sword? Did the knight have a sword? Maybe that was the sword. The world is full of mysteries. We're inside a church. Was she covered with blood? Skull was next on the list? No. Who else would have gone into battle against Vecna? Could've been Kash. Who? Oh that fancy fellow. Oh, we'll still circularly argue about something. It's been a half-hour of fuckery right here. We stepped out for a second. Three? Five? LIAM and How? We have her body. I don't know what that means. I'm a holy man. I'm a priest of Ioun. I don't know about the undead. My brother, please. No problem. Heroes' Feast. Chalice from the palace? Okay. That could work. Opposable thumbs. Them. Bank in the morning? One more thing before we go to sleep. Not to draw this out any longer. I'm going to, right before bed, attempt to turn into, using my True Polymorph, one of those fun, winged, tall creatures we met at Pelor's place. I've seen it, but I don't know it. In my room. Okay, just wanted to make sure that would work. Cool. No, I just stand there naked looking at myself. Anything else that happens in that room, you don't want to know.
