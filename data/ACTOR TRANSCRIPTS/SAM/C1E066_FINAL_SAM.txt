So I have some questions for the leader of-- oh, what? I know. I'm with this. Thank you. Wait, let me roll this. 14. (sings dramatic music) And he's a test? We're not to kill anyone else in the room? But Liam's did? Maybe it's because they're projectiles? It's like a thousand feet. Jesus. We'll get it later, we'll go get it later. As he attacks, can I use Cutting Words to reduce the attack? I'll try. Yeah, I say to him, oi! Your face is so ugly I'm considering casting Blindness on myself so I don't have to look at it! (laughter) A ten or an eight? Hey, six! I got a natural 20! Whoa! This is a powerful fighter! Why? So it did not hurt him at all? Okay, before I go, because I wasn't in the room, did J'mon Sa Ord say this is a test? Okay. Okay, I'm out of range so he can't swipe me as I walk away, right? Then I'll stay put. Let's not risk that. So I'll Hand Cone up. Otiluke's Resilient Sphere to trap the beast. He's Huge, I thought you said he was 15 feet! (groans dramatically) I have perfectly huge balls. They're Large or smaller. Okay, so I ditch that. And because I saw lightning work I'm going to-- well, then I'm going to have to move. Can I hit him now without hitting Keyleth or do I have to move for that? I'll just Lightning Bolt, then. Level three Lightning Bolt. It's a saving throw? Does my Cutting Words affect that at all? No, but because I'm armed with Mythcarver, when I use it, my target gets disadvantage on his next saving throw. Oh, okay. So 8d6 then. 24. Okay, I'll use that opportunity to back away and hope it doesn't get me. Yeah, I'll go all the way to the wall. Yeah, but not the glass. God, who's coming up next? I will inspire Grog, he hasn't happened yet, right? I will inspire him with a hastily written limerick. Okay, ready? Kevdak had these terrible knuckles. They beat up on Grog while he chuckled. But while Kevin laughed, Grog sliced him in half And said, "These are mine now, fuckles!" (laughter) That is all I can do. He's got 500 hit points. And shoot yourself in the face. To ridiculous size! I don't know. Yeah, I'm not there. You've got inspiration. Oh great. So it felt that? Did you say 50? I will heal Vex'ahlia. Am I 30 feet away or closer? Well, then I will walk 11 feet closer. And I will use Healing Word to heal her. I'll sing to her (singing) Up, up and away on your beautiful, your beautiful broom! (laughter) I mean, it's a bonus action so I can't go very high with the level, can I? As my main action can't be level-- what? Got it. Well, then I'll do this one at level two, and I can do anything for my main action. Okay. Level two! Do I roll? I roll. One, two-- That's it! Seven. No, I rolled two. Six? I thought it was plus five? Well, whatever. Oh that's right! I got to mark that down! I'm going to go back to right where I was. And shit. Shitballs. Shit. Shitballs fucking shit. I will use (singing) Bigby's Hand. Bigby's Hand is going to make a huge fist, fly forward, and smash the window. Behind him. Melee spell attack. Well, that's cocked. 12 plus what? Oh. 22. 4d8. I only have 1d8. 13 plus eight. 21. No! 22. No! What is it? Can I use any action to take off my hat and let my hair flow, Matthew Mercer style? You know, if we can't kill it we can all kill ourselves out the window. Sorry, Vax. Okay. That's wishful thinking! Do we notice any rocket boosters on its heels? Covered in blood. Don't leave me hanging, says Bigby's Hand! Are there shards of glass on the ground? Or did they all go outward? Can I have Bigby pick up one and bring it back? A tiny piece. No. You're on your own, fuckface. I'll take that, please. To call who? Is that a name that you go by? She lost a lot of blood. Ahem. Excuse me. Your imminence-- imminence? Eminence. As we are strangers in this foreign land, we were also wondering if you would lend us some sort of a calling card, something that proves that we are friends of the state, it might serve us well as we are automatically suspicious as we walk around your great city. Or no. Either way, we're good. Oh! Professional! Sunday? Motherfucker! (laughter) Thank you so much. And I drop six inches, which is to my knee, and bow my head in supplication. Oh! Be pleased. How am I supposed to remember "beep-beep" from two weeks ago? It's a two year professional degree. Did anyone die? Did you see a javelin? No? Maybe? Okay. 20 and a one. Is it sundown yet? Oh yeah. Can we take a short rest somewhere? And hit dice it up or something? Take a knee. It's not very much but yes! Yes, I do. I've never used it because it's so weak. But yeah, sure. Yeah. I do. I'm trying to find where-- Song of Rest. It's only a d10? What is it? All right. I will sing us a Song of Rest. I'll sing. (singing) I believe you can kill. I believe that you really will. Think about it every night and day. Sharpen your blades because it's time to play. I believe! Okay, it's time to go get some spice! (laughter) Guys. If we're going to this casino, I have a deal to make. I value your friendship. I value the backup you will provide, but I need you to stay far away. Be inconspicuous. And by the gods, do not help me in any way! Unless I say some sort of a codeword. That's a good one. Let's make it that! Help me. Help me. Oh God, help me! Yes? Keep it down, dude! Chill! Just chill! We are not cool. LAURA and Not at all. Set up? I have to change into my red shirt. Nearby is fine. Nearby is fine but keep your distance and do not do anything including if it looks like I'm in trouble. I had it commissioned as art. Okay, okay. What would that codeword be? Well, we are being honest on this trip, right? "Kill everything," means make a distraction, right? But "Help, help, oh god, help," means I need help. Tomato paste? Let's stick with tomato paste. I feel like that's easier to work into a sentence than "Love-a the spice." Really nervous, guys. I've never done a drug deal-- (whispers) a drug deal before. Yes, of course! I said, "Spice. Spice. Spice," And shady people came around. That means it's a drug, right? I told them. They seemed illicit about it. I'm very excited! Where is the casino? I wrote it down. It's where the Ravenites are. Nope! That's a different page. It's not The Debt's Respite. It is just The Casino, right? Does it have a name? All right. I'm heading to the casino. Would you all like to join me? And you can entertain yourselves with some games while I-- I wear the same exact thing every day. I'm putting my red shirt on. Just going to melt? Or does it--? What, Travis? What is that? What is it? You're a high-roller? Oh, yeah! Wait. Have you even tasted it yet? Wow! Who said that? Well, shit. Always bid on Thordak. Getting tossed from the casino. What is that? He's just rolling once to see-- 2d4! It's your rules, you could do anything! It could be 1d8! Why does it have to be 2d4? Makes no sense! I'm trying to wander away from them as best I can. Go there. I think you roll first-- This is the most important roll-- Seven. (cheering) This is a streak at this point. Yeah, I've forgotten, Matt, did they say to meet in a specific spot, or was it they'll know you from your red shirt? Okay, so then I am going up to, I'm walking past some of the higher rollers that I see, and as I walk past I'm going, (clears throat) I'm the guy. I'm the guy. (clears throat) It's me. (clears throat, whispers) I'm the guy. And keep walking if they don't-- Maybe. Lead the way. I'll join him. I will gladly follow. (clears throat) So what have you got for me? Oh, yes, I enter and sit down. Again, maybe. Maybe more, if it's of a higher quality. How do I know it's of a quality I'm accustomed to, from my homeland? Forgive me, I'm not from around here. I don't know of your reputation. Could I possibly have a sample to see? 20. (yelling) The whole satchel? Yeah, what does it look like? Oh, I'll pull it towards me, yeah. What is this shit! It's not a fine powder, it's chunky? Of course. This isn't my first rodeo, friend. Being that I play stringed instruments, I have long nails, so I'll take my pinky and sort of dip down and get a little on the end of my pinky, smell it a bit, on my gums a little bit. Spiced meat. Am I feeling high at all? Constitution check? I've never checked my constitution -- Saving throw. Well, either way it's 16. I'll do a little bit more. Get it on my tongue. (sniffing) Just a little bit more to see if it's doing anything. 16. I'm not dead. I guess that's good. You know, where I'm from sometimes we burn it and inhale it that way. Is that done? What methods do you guys use here? Don't worry about me, friend, all right? My mom and dad, that's their job, all right? All right. I guess I'll take it. Your reputation and the seeming good quality makes me believe that this is of a fine caliber, quality, how that's-- ugh. Stings a little in the eyes, that's all. For two satchels like this, why don't we say 300? Fair enough. 400 it is. For me to pay him? Sure, I'll drop four hundred large. Four hundred thousand dollars. You can call me The Meat Man. (snorting and giggling) And what shall I call you? Rutur? Rutur. And so I'm clear here, this is a drug, right? Oh! Really? I'm not feeling it yet, do I need to do more of it, is that the thing? Oh. It doesn't? All right, great, thanks, bye! Sorry. I've got two big bags of drugs. Could you give me a backpack or something to put this in? I mean, I can't walk out of the casino holding this. As they go, I say to them, remember, we met, but you did not meet the Meat Man. Okay. (breathing heavily) I hyperventilate for a second. I don't know what's going on. Where are you guys? Where are you guys? (yells in surprise) It's not me, it's not, they're not mine! And I throw it across the room. Don't say anything. I've got lots of drugs. I don't know what I did. Maybe! It hasn't affected me yet! I know! I don't know what it's supposed to do! I think so! Yeah, just one more. One more. Yeah! 13. We'll talk to some locals and figure out how we're really supposed to do it. Yeah! Two people thrown out of the club! That's a yard glass. We need to find out if it's real. Should we go back and ask those guys who sold this to me? Are you sure it's not real? It looks like nothing. Hey, can you nature check this? You're a nature person. He's fine. Yeah, I guess. I'm upstairs trying to take it anally. (laughter) No one lies to the Meat Man. I want to go back to that place and get my revenge. Are you with me, Vax? Vax! It feels a little tingly, but overall just fine. Like, 50. He lied to me. Don't spend any money on it. Maybe it has to activate that way! 17. (thickly) Huh? That's good shit. (more inarticulate noises) (inarticulate noise) (sobbing) (thickly) Be pleased. Maybe I can package it into smaller amounts and sell it on the street to recoup some of the money. Do we have an afternoon to kill? Yes. Damn it, what did I do? I should have insight checked him, or I could've dominated, there are so many things I could have done to him to find out! I flew too close to the sun. (laughter) I wander down, (sighs) good morning all! I hope you slept nicely. My jaw seems to work! Thank you for not nursing me at all last night, I would've done the same to you. Aw, fuck you! (laughter) All right. Something with meat, I need to use this spice. The innkeeper knew of the spice, correct? Can I talk to the innkeeper really quick? Oy, Treev? That fusaka spice, how much does it go for usually for a bag? Big bag, sack? Hog's head, right? That hurts. I thought you people said it was expensive? What if it's really high quality fusaka? Thanks, Treev. All right, I'm good. Let's go on our journey. No, I think my kingpin days are over. Yes, sorry. Distracted. Here. Can we just walk up to the door? I flash the thing again and say, in Gnomish He'll want to talk to us. We've come a great distance to meet him. (sighs) I said Someone loan me 350 gold. I'm carrying two giant sacks of spice. It weighs me down. No! They're mine. Loot Crate, ladies and gentlemen. I'm wearing one of the shirts right now. It came in this month's Loot Box! Loot Crate, I think it's called, actually, not a Loot Box. Yeah, that alone makes it worth about $500. Every box. In some circles. Oh boy, Travis is looking! (laughter) Persuasion check. She's the best at those! That's good. What are we asking when we get in, by the way? Shoot him in the head. (laughter) (French accent) Mythcarver! Is how some would say it. Can you tell me anything more about the blade? But these have Critical Role themes to them! No way, that's really available? I want one! How much are they? $50, $100? Just $20? Maybe we just asked the wrong questions. To be fair, we were asking him favors for no benefit. Do you want me to burn down his house? Nothing. We need to reach out to this woman, right? We do know where she lives. I have contacts in the underworld here. Should we go pay a visit to what's-her-butt? What's our play here? We need her? Did we make a mistake here? Should we have said something else? But what information could this person have given us? Percy, can you give him that piece? We could sneak in. We could just go down the hole. See what's there. Kiki and I could be dragonflies and just buzz on down. So our options are go down the hole, get caught; go find the girl with the cloak-- Or all bum rush my friends at the casino, and get revenge. Maybe they know something more about things! It was my lucky gold piece that I got. It was buried in with the rest. I didn't notice it. I need a nap, that's all. I need a nap. You know, there's also one other. We've heard that there's shady people at the-- Wait, have we been to the Debt's Respite? Let's knock on Mistress Asharru's door. Maybe we could trade her one! We could do some recon on her place. I could go up to the front door and pretend to be a FedEx delivery guy or something. 14. Nothing. Should I just go knock on the front door? Whatever you want. Bug? You want bug? I don't even know what that is. You know why they call her Vex the Rat? Do you want me to do a bug? Be a bug? All right, I'll be a beautiful dragonfly. Look for any openings in the windows or vents-- Chimneys? Air intakes? Right, so then I'll just hang out by a window for a little bit and look. I don't know anything about that. Do I see anyone in any of the windows? Okay. Just going to go all the way around the house, high and low, looking for a way in. Do I find it? A lot. 24. One. I will fly around and see if I knock into anything. Am I in a room that's closed off? Can I keep going through the house? All right, I'll see if I can make my way. Five. I doubt dragonflies are even in the monster manual. Look for dragon perception. Ooh! I go outside immediately. I bamf out. There's a trapdoor. We've got to go down the trapdoor. No one's in the house! We can just go in, snickety-snack! Let's go in, go down the trapdoor, see what it is. No, we don't need them. Let's just go. They'll make noise! You, me, and you, we're the stealthy ones. Yeah, you're right. We should totally tell the others. I've got a bipolar thing going on, manic-depressive episode. Anyway. There's a trapdoor. We should go down it. Yeah, I did. I saw the sign that someone had opened a trapdoor and gone down it. Wait, first I'm going to try to pick the lock. Four. All right, I'll just go in there. All right, I will Dimension Door inside. Goddamn it. On the inside? No, more blood toward the trapdoor and then it fades, so someone came out of the trapdoor-- An alarm. I go over to the trapdoor and inspect it for traps. It being a trapdoor, it should have a trap. 17. Can anyone talk to her? I'm looking for other exits. I was looking for other exits and entrances to the building all around, and I rolled a 29. To the street? Single Whitestone Female? I found a secret exit that someone could have used to come in and kill, or exit after, or maybe not at all. How long has the body been here? A week? I'll talk to my contacts in the underworld. We could at least ask around and see if anyone has-- But she disguises her appearance, doesn't she? It's a murder mystery now! Nice job creating an entire casino, including brand new games! We should really go back to this casino and ask around for Ripley, maybe. Maybe. Just to win favor with the locals.
