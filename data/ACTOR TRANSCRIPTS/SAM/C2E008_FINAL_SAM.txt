Last week, as you all know, I sent out a request saying, "Send "me your stories of D&D Beyond, mail me your stories," so I got some viewer mail to read. "Dear "Sam, you're my favorite on Critical Role, don't tell Travis!" "Also a big fan of D&D Beyond, but had one question Was that you I saw in Studio City, "running around covered only in mayonnaise? If so, what the hell, dude?" I don't know what that is. "Dear Sam, I own a convenience store, we have your show on our TV all the time, love you as Nott, but "please be aware I've filed an injunction to keep you a hundred feet away from the store. We have "you on-camera stealing jars of mayonnaise and smearing them all over your body. They already are, aren't they? Certainly. Your turn to block mine! Hey, are you guys going to hold a Critter contest to name your child? I don't know. He's very mysterious. What does that mean, the Traveler? What does that mean? Oh. Do you worship the Traveler? Okay, maybe she doesn't worship the Traveler. Are you okay, Caleb? You went a little quiet there for a little while. Oh, didn't we get some items as well? Is it a stick? I like sticks. Can you see through my clothes? No. Maybe you could just look at it and see with your smarts. How about the one that I stole from her? Would you-- I want it back, though. Should we just go to the Feed and Mead? Or somewhere else? There's only one pub. Are my ears tucked back in? Okay. You're really all right, Caleb? I know, but you went a bit catatonic. Did you see anything or have a vision? I don't know. All right. They were bad. All right. I'm going to keep getting shots and pouring them into my flask and going up and asking for another. (singing) It's a dick in a book. Natural dick 20. Is this our first item? Oh, he's casting the wand. Insta-death. That's a big thing. It's too dangerous. Beau could use it, right? None of us can use it? Oh yeah, who's keeping stuff? Are you our stuff keeper? Oven mitt? And not me, because I've just been getting them and pouring them. This is the wand, this is just it? I rolled a four. I can't stop! I don't know, dear gods! It hurts! Oh gods! It's painful! It's okay. The Wand of Smiles. Love it. I think that we should all say thank you to Caleb for identifying our objects. You're welcome. Did you save me? Thank you. Are they vacant? Where are the ears? Someone has them safe. Maybe it should be in Caleb and I's room because we'll have the alarm to protect us. All right. It's mostly about mayonnaise. We'll come back to you. Two quick things. One, I'd like to ask Caleb, when he's done with his insanely long ritual That pouch that I gave you, what was in it? Oh, I gave you a pouch before. You might not have felt it, but it's in your back pocket. Before? I am the best. Yes. Ow! No, that's good, because my muscles are sore from smiling before. Then I'm going to try to make acid while he was doing his thing. 19, plus things. All right. Awesome. You have copper and silver for sure. Iron? It's bronze? Brass, okay. Or 19 total? Jules, Petrov, Herma-- Then there was a couple that Shak√§ste had in the-- We're fucking rich! Are we going to divvy it up? We're very strong. That's the number nine. That's where we're staying? Is that enough horses? Should we be getting two more to pull us faster? For six? (whispering) Because he's balls deep right now. (laughter) There's a j in it. Tough. (laughter) Is she a jeweler? It's a translation, I think. SAM and It's the whole song. TRAVIS and So you're the daughter of a celebrity. How was that, growing up in fame and fortune? Just trapped in your room? Was he a client of your mother's? We can look away. That's very sad. So are you going to find him to meet him and know him, or to seek revenge upon him? Why aren't you allowed to be at the house anymore? What did you do? What kind of a prank? Okay. That is funny-- So he was just out there in a girdle. And you embarrassed him? What was his name, so we can avoid him? Let's avoid all Lords. Robert. I bet you are! Do you know his name? She's tall. Yasha. She carries flowers. Black chin. Are we sure we want to leave this place? People like us here. Okay. No, no, no. I'm a goblin. That's nice. Well, you know, the funny things about goblins is we don't really celebrate birthdays or anything so it's hard for me to know exactly. There's no real holidays in clans. I'm of child bearing age. So I'm about somewhere between six and nine. So that's like a grown-- almost grown goblin. Yeah, but like I said is really hard for me to tell. It's not like we had a party every year. Today we're calling my birthday? Apparently. What day is it? All right. Well for right now, let's say it's Thursday. All right. Thank you. Do you know a birthday song too? (screams) Is it old? It's already Fessuran!? It feels like "Huvnufn." Well, thank you, Caleb. All right. Oh, sorry, we'll leave now. I tried it last time, maybe I'll try again this time. Animal handling? 19! Yeehaw! (laughter) Like a gentleman? Yes, that sounds good. I'll take number two! That'd be purple, blue, and orange. Ah, that's some good syphilis. I'll stand up and go next to Caleb, and say Honey, did you tell them about our disease? Sure. Dodge and pick up my weapons. It should say. All on one guy? Ooh, that's Vax numbers. (magic sounds) I'm going to disappear back into the woods. DM shade. While they're talking, can I do a long circle around the whole campsite, looking for horses that are tied up? Okay. 19. I will unhitch the stakes. Let's see here. Five of them I'll just shoo, the meekest five I'll shoo off into the woods and the other four I'll try to control and take with me somewhere else. 18 plus something! Plus three-- No, plus zero. I walk back into camp with the horses and tie them up. I found some horses. I named them Loo, John, Crapper, and Toilet. Money? What did you have before? When you were with your mother? Caleb's still out. This is not a good system. Travis, will you teach her how to keep track of our group stuff? It's like, all over the place next to dick pics. Oh, I'll take some of those. No, because what if we need-- someone else-- I'll take 20. Yes, I'm second watch. Oh man, eight. Hello. Were you having a bad dream? That was some good lying. Oh boy. Your face is fucked up. (laughter) We're in the same exact place, you're not dead. They're all dead, they're gone. We took their horses, they're gone. Yes! He's very smart. Good wrist action, terrible roll. Whoa! It's true, he does need to pee quite frequently. It's Yorick. There must be some nice places here, right? Well, that village we were just in was not bad, except for, you know, the gnoll attack. Let's consult our notes. Oh, that's where the magic school is, right? Maybe they'll have nicer things. Arts. Culture. Hard to tell what motions you're doing. This place sucks! Too much water. Are we supposed to go to the Pillow Trove or the Leaky Tap? The East Westersheets. What was it? I thought it was the East Outer! Looks like you're writing a letter! Oh, he only knows it by the Zemnian name. No, like a "clockcruzen." That's how you say it in your language, I think. A "clockenticken." I've been picking up little bits of the language. Ja. It's not D and D Beyond, it's D N D Beyond. You don't want to type in an "and," because that will take you to a porn site. What does Stannis Baratheon say? Should we go to this dingy tunnel? What is going on right now? To the tunnels! Friends. Freundes. They have a monorail? LAURA and Sell some things? That does sound terrible. Well, come see us at the Leaky Tap and maybe we'll hire you tomorrow morning. I have extreme syphilis. One. Was he trustworthy? I will aid her in that search. I'll go in as well. Caleb?! What have you done to him?! What have you done to Caleb?! Ah! It's gentle. What?! I think I'll buy-- I'm Nott! I'm just Nott! Hi! Nice to meet you! You're large! Can I have one? I'll have two of those potions, if you don't mind. Is there a discount for two? That would be zero. (laughter) All right, I'll take two." Pumat. What are you insighting? You just died. Yes. Like a briefcase of carrying. A backpack of-- That looks like the thing that we need. I mean, that's cocked a little bit. It's a good wand. It's a good stick. We need that sack! We need this sack to keep our stuff in it. You need some pastries, but we'd need somewhere else. Which trick? Oh, the pink-ify? I need the tarts. I cast spells with them. I need just a couple. Okay, but I need them. I'll take two. Those men were incredible. The Canadians.
