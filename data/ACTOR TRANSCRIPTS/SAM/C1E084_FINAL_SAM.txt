Hi everyone, it's me, pro alpine skier Sam Riegel, a.k.a. Scanlan Shorthalt from Critical Role. You know, when I'm not rolling dice, I'm rolling the dice on the hot, hot slopes of Park City, Utah. (worried noise) Anyway. I just did a lot of downhill skiing today, and it was pretty cool, but not as cool as the stuff you can get inside Lootcrate. Sign up now and you'll save so much money, you can come on an exciting vacation to Park City, Utah, buy skis, and gloves, and go skiing. With me! Sam Riegel, a.k.a Scanlan Shorthalt from TV's-- well. The internet's Critical Role! Anyway, I'm about to go do my last run. Hope I don't break my leg. (worried noise) If I do, I won't see you on Thursday, but if I don't, let's roll high. Bye-bye.
