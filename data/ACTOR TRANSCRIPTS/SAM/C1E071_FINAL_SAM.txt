Someone get a camera on this guy. What? A present for me? On stream? Oh, this is so exciting. What did I get? It's a great gift! Shirt-ception! Part four! (yells) Oh man! This is the best gift! It's the gift that keeps giving. Yeah. I'm going to take a picture of me. Someone can put that on a shirt. Oh man, this is amazing. That's so great. That's my favorite gift I've ever gotten. Oh man. Thank you, guys. That's so sweet. I prepared a history lesson tonight. It's a history of crates. Ancient Greece Zeus presents a lovely crate to the first woman on earth, a lovely gal named Pandora. It contained death and evil, corrupted the world forevermore. Egypt 1957, the Ark of the Covenant-- sort of a crate; it carried the Ten Commandments-- is opened by Colonel Dietrich and Dr. Rene Belloq. Ghosts fly out, and it melts the faces of several Nazis, while Indiana Jones hides his face. Los Angeles, California, 1995 Rookie detective David Mills, played by Brad Pitt, receives a cardboard crate from murder suspect John Doe! It contains the head of his girlfriend, Gwyneth Paltrow. Your town, present day you receive a small, expertly constructed crate that contains geek chic gear and apparel from The Walking Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Halloween! Now, which would you rather get? The Ark of the Covenant? Pandora's box? A box with Gwyneth Paltrow's head in it? Or a Loot Crate, which you can use code CriticalRole to get 10% off your monthly crate. Guys, I think there's only one choice. That would be fine! I would much rather do these! I would do these for money every day! (laughter) Battle? Wait, we're going to battle? Why're you waking me up? Sure? An attack? But we literally just got back from telling them to be ready to move tomorrow morning. So we have to go back and tell them-- And they were pissed. They were super pissed that we were there. We could go back. Tooma is not going to be pleased. That's true. What are the details? I don't know. Be ready to attack tomorrow morning. We're going to deliver a giant beast for the dragon to hunt, and that her people should be ready to strike. That's it. You don't get to say roll! He's not sleeping on it, is he? We don't know! We haven't seen this thing. Quick! Draw a picture of Grog, and then we'll know. No, we kept out of sight in the caverns and Vorugal we don't think saw us, but we also didn't see Vorugal, either. Wouldn't see me. I don't want to speak for Vax, but if we're going back tonight, you no longer have the ability to fly, is that true? But you do, Vexy? Oh, yeah. Well, that would've been helpful last time, actually. But yes, if I were a fly-- I assume any of us can avoid his detection if we stay low and invisible. Well, yes. Right? I can make you invisible. She told us to release Yenk-- The summoning circle or something like that. All right? I'm leaving mine in the mansion. Bring something that you don't mind putting down. No, leave that at home. I can make you invisible. You can fly us down through the cavern, but you're going to have to be super stealthy. Okay. Don't know how that'll work if we're flying, but okay. Doesn't that cover our tracks? Oh, that's the stealth rolls thing? Okay, good. Wait, Keyleth, will you hold onto my Mythcarver sword for me? I can trust you. Oh boy. That's a big smile. Okay. Don't kill anyone with it. I feel nothing. Sometimes I have to hold it with my left hand so it feels different. Yes, I will use yet another 3rd-level Invisibility spell to make us both invisible. Yeah, so we made a right here and left here and right at the big rock. Vex is the girl one. Vax is the boy. Isn't Minxie big and spottable? That's so hot. Polymorph just lasts. Wait, no. So he has to stay within range. It's got to be something that can go as fast as we're going. If he were a black crow or something he could fly back on its own. A moth can't travel a mile. With one yellow eye and one black eye. All right, let's go. Do I also get to give her any assistance, like "we went this way, go that way?" Dice jail already? We should do the same thing we did last time. I know you weren't here. We turned visible, asked to guards to go-- It's going to be really shitty when we get in there, because she's going to hate us. I will drop invisibility. Are the guards around? Oh, we'll stay invisible until we get to the guards. Where did we meet the guards last time? That's where we want to meet them again. Yep, same routine. We'll leave our weapons here. This is my friend Vex. We'd like to see Tooma again. I know it's very upsetting that we have to make these night calls like this but it's very important. Yes. We offer profound apologies for waking you from your slumber again. At the spot where you told us. Question, before we go. Typically when you've done this in the past, you inform Vorugal and he heads on over right away? Does he need to see evidence of a hunt? How does it work? Do you typically inform him? Skork? And is there some sort of hunt horn or anything that signals the beginning of this, or does it just happen? I don't want to mess this up. If Vorugal were to see anyone near this summoning circle, would he be suspicious, or would he be okay with it? Okay. Good to know. There's like a 50/50 chance we'll come back again tonight. No? 60/40. We're out of here. Sorry. Oh yeah, invisibility yet again. I'm out of 3rd-level spells. Yes, I've made us invisible again. With advantage? Oh snap! 12, 22-- 24. She's a night person. She's okay. First? Do we have any spells to do that? You have another Tree Stride in you? Didn't we get here today? We saw her literally today. Is that a new set of dice? You stopped on the way here to buy dice? Oh, great. Pike's good at quiet. Oh Jesus. Wait, what? Oh my god. The dragon's going to fucking kill us right now. Yeah, Matt. Why did you roll two natural ones? The door is shimmery and shiny? Close the door. The dragon. Yes, everyone sleep now. The mansion will last 24 hours, so it'll be dark again by the time it wears off, so we can stay in here as long as we need to. But do we have things we need to accomplish today? But with Percival's engineering skills, he could maybe find a good little spot of granite for you to dig into or something. I'm keeping all options on the table. They don't have to be giant caverns. It's just a little nook. A little foxhole. Okay, how do we do that? In broad daylight. It's called Invisible Reconnaissance. I will say this I love the sound of this spell, but wouldn't travelling mist be really undetectable? Could we mist around? There's a snowstorm out there. We're just going to be one with the clouds. My worry about animals is don't we also have the intellect of the animals that we become? So we keep our own intellect? A flock of hawks, they don't go together. But a flock of pigeons do, or a flock of geese. Tell me this, can you not do that? If you throw it and don't want to travel where it is? Go right in my neck. Oh! You get to choose? Maybe don't ever do that again, please. It takes a while, but yes. Two questions. Are we all going? And question two, when we get there and find a suitable location for carving caves, are you going to do this right now, or are we just scouting? We're going to do this right now? Well, we can't communicate when we're in mist form, so you just have to go do if you feel it. Yeah, what do we look like? Are we a yellow cloud, a white cloud? It is. It really is. But we discussed before we left that we would mainly stick to the lowlands and the ravine to get there, yeah? Shouldn't Laura lead? Do I get to add Jack of all-- I'm not. Okay. 18. Ooh. Wow, Matt. It's Arendelle! Can Vorugal see this spot? Oh, I'm great at those. Six! While she's doing that, I'm going to fly through Pike a few times. I'll see him doing that and join him. Question, Percy. There's this annoying wind. (laughter) Here's a question. Rather than scouting here, digging a hole, and going back to our mansion, should we just have a new mansion here? Kima. I could technically drop that mansion and she'd be on her ass. (laughs) Well, someone could go back and get her. We don't have to do this right now, but when we're done here, maybe we want to camp here so we have a place to hide inside a mansion. And we don't even really need to make tunnels, do we? Yeah, that's true. We want to spread out. I know, it's so annoying. I'm going to scan the sky. And there's these rocks here. We know there's some rocks. We knows that there's tons of ice. We saw him on the way over. We know exactly where he is. What sorts of things can you ask nature? No, that's good to know. Does this make noise? Will it vibrate the ground? We saw a storm coming. Has it hit yet? We can wait until the storm comes. It'll be super windy and loud. Can you do something to ice? Melt it? That's silent. Yeah, but we could carve out ice tunnels. We can hide behind rocks. Can you make new rocks that are hollow? I guess it'll still make noise. How important are these tunnels? Because if we want, while you're doing this I can go distract the dragon? Sure, why not? TALIESIN and To distract the dragon so you can dig. We have the stones. What about the stones? Stones. Someone can mist back with the stone, then mist back to us and give her the stone. Ooh! If Pike is going back as mist-- no offense, Pike-- can you find the mansion? Okay. Gladly. Did you guys de-mist-ify? Hey, clever elves, can you scout around, make sure we're not being watched? We're not being watched? You sure those hawks are hawks? Terrible. 11. Ooh, my girl! Okay. Kima, sorry to interrupt lunch-- Disgusting. We need to move. That will disappear when we leave here. Do you need me to help, as well? I produce one half of the stones that we brought, and I say-- oh wait, does she know how to do this? I guess you just think, right? You just think. You have to think. I know that's hard, but you're going to have to hold this rock and want it to be reunited with its pair. I'm sorry about that. And then you'll be bamfed back to where we're going, all right? Here, take this stone. All right, so we'll just step out of the mansion. I won't drop it yet, because there's no need. And we're going to mist back, but after she's bamfed. All right. So think happy thoughts, click your heels together. She's okay. Can you do a one-handed push-up? Can I see? Can I try a one-handed push-up? Seven. (laughter) I'm carrying a lot of stuff. Without my gear, I could probably do it. Yeah. Magic weighs on you. All right, let's go. Scanning the skies for any sight of a flapping white dragon. She can manipulate ice. Why a hundred feet up? Can we just do 20 feet up? Yeah! Why a hundred feet? Why not 20 feet? Why not 30 feet? Why? Hey, guys. Did you see the dragon leave? Should we be concerned at all? That he's going to meet up with Raishan? And fuck us? We hired somebody? TALIESIN and When was this? We did? Why on earth would we do that? We're super strong. Oh shit. Sorry. Oh! Oh, Larkin! Oh, yes! I totally remember you, Larkin! Will you be joining us here at the battle or providing support from afar? What kind of support? Long-distance attacks or healing? And Larkin, the reason we hired you, now that I remember, was for your extreme knowledge of dragons and their behaviors. Tell me this should we be concerned when this one leaves his lair about hobbling its lair or somehow preventing it from returning? Well, we know that it'll be coming here for a fight. Is there a way to prevent it from getting back to its lair? Mercenary. Ravenites. Who? You know why? We have Pike! That's our other ally. She's here now. I'll make the mansion behind a rock outcropping. Kima, I need your help to make sure I'm not spotted while I do this ritual. Well, someone has to be on the outside watching to find out what's happening. Someone who can be invisible, someone who can be a hawk or Ravenite? Tomorrow, we're talking about? Yes, absolutely! Well, someone would have to be next to the doorway, pop their head in and say, oi, it's on. But we also have these bubbles of watching around, don't we? Or I can just drop the mansion. And at the very least, Kima can be waiting inside the mansion, as can our lesser stealthy friend Pike. At least keep them in there. All right. It's something. There is no mansion yet. I haven't done it yet. All right, I will cast the mansion behind a rock. It's Yenk. (laughter) Kima, if it would help, I can erase your memory of this whole thing-- I'll let it alone for now. Behind the bigger rock where Percy's stationed right now. Larkin can take care of-- Hey, it took me five minutes. Ashley figured it out before us. Who's going to do it? Immune to fear. Advantage on wisdom saves. Immune to poison. Increased 14 points. Okay and if she starts killing us, what do we do? Hide in the mansion? Regroup? Let's go fight. Oh, sleep. What? Am I making us all Ravenites, or does that not even matter anymore? Okay. I guess if I'm going to be out in the open, I probably should. Sure. You mean wearing white clothes? I guess I'll make us all white Ravenites. Normal Ravenites with lighter-colored clothing that can maybe blend in. But also we can't dance very well and we clap on the two and the four. So yes, I'll make us all Ravenites. I can do eight people, so that's everyone, including Kima. I'm going out. Oh wait, before I leave, doesn't someone have to buff me up for this spell? Yeah, what time is it? Is it dawn? Eight. Okay. How will we know when it's time for me to release? We have to wait for Tooma to go report. I assume. Vax, do you want to go look? No, fuck Larkin. To see when Tooma's coming. I don't want to release this thing before Tooma is there reporting to Vorugal. But when? No, when is Vorugal coming? We can't sit out here all day waiting. The Ravenites have to tell him to come here first. No, she's telling him now. Today. We told her to wait. Who, me? Oops, Percy died. Does anyone want to be invisible for an hour? Some of us will be. Do you want to wait in the house, Grog? And Pike, too? Okay, I'm going to cast it and probably go into the house. I can make a couple of you invisible. Keyleth, do you want to make anybody invisible? You can't do that? You know what? I can't do it, anyway. I think Gate is a concentration spell. Even if I'm reading it off a scroll? It is a concentration spell. Okay. Then I can't make anyone invisible. Can you become an animal? Ever? I will inspire myself. Yes, I will say to myself all right, Scanlan. I know that your palms are sweaty. Your knees are weak, arms heavy. There's cologne on your tunic, Grog's spaghetti. But just remember. You're good enough. You're smart enough, and doggone it, people like you. I'm still going to hang out by the rocks, and I can go at least 60 feet in front of me, but I'll do 50 feet. In the center, basically. Yeah, sure. And his name is Yenk? I'm not going to read it until I hear wings flapping. It takes six seconds to do, right? Oh boy. That's an eight. Okay, I'm casting. Okay. So I roll with advantage? (gasps) Not great. Okay. And what am I adding? Plus two? Plus my charisma? 20. Facing away from me. No, I close it instantly. I'm going to tiptoe backwards into the mansion. That's a seven. 21! (cheering) I sing at it. I sing at it. I will sing (singing) Yenk, you will be our friend, travel through the portal and back again. Your heart is true, you're a fiend and a confidant. Boom boom boom. (speaking) All right, so I will Dominate Monster, with the hand cone. 21. I say, you will stay here, and you will kill a white dragon. And I will tiptoe back into the mansion. It's huge! We're in a lobby, eating chicken. Yeah, that means he's still dominated. Okay. Okay. Would I feel that? No, I'm on another plane of existence. Yes, Yenk! Yes! I'm going to cast Invisibility on myself and poke my head out the door. Yeah, that'll work. Fucking eight. Battle is still going on. I'll check again in 12 seconds. And expose yourself? Are you on the ground? Are you going to go up his ass into his stomach? In the dragon! It's not even a Dungeons and Dragons book. They're all people! SAM and Has it been two rounds? How about since I looked last? After 12 seconds, I will look. I will stick my head out and look again. He's a total not-a-good-hunter. I thought he enjoyed the hunt! I've poked my head out to look. I pop my head back in and I tell them shit's going down. Should we go out or let this play out a bit? Yenk is not dead. Yenk is not dead, so we will be fighting Yenk, as well. I guess we go. I'm going to leave the mansion and start running. 14. That's top of the round! Yeah, this is great. Don't worry, we've got our secret weapon. Our secret weapon, by the way, now wants to kill all of us. He wants to kill us. Come on, Yenk. Kill that thing. (plastic platform clatters) He's not going to have to check anything. Five points of damage! Okay! Come on, Yenk! Do not draw attention to yourself, friend. Me? I'm still invisible. I'm going to leave the mansion. No, I cast Invisibility after I cast Dominate Monster. I'm going to leave the mansion and clockwise around the game board. If I inspire, that kills my invisibility? Then I will use my bonus action to keep moving. To dash? I will dash and keep moving away and that way. That's it? Okay. I don't want to draw attention to myself, so that'll be that. I'm only within range of Kima. I'm not going to give away my position to inspire her. She's the best one of the group! (laughter) Blight spell? He's secretly Raishan! Yes, Yenk. He does not see me! Can I use Cutting Words to reduce the attack? 13. I add nothing to it, right? Jesus. I will continue my movement clockwise around the board. How far is he from me? A long way. 150 to 200 feet? Has my invisibility dropped when I got blasted? Concentration? Is it plus anything? 14. Okay. Is he within 120 feet of me? All right, I'll punch him in the face. Yeah. I will Bigby's Hand him. He's way too big. I can try to grab a wing. DM, how does this work? I cannot grapple anything above a huge monster. Can I grapple part of a gargantuan monster? So I just punch him. Simply a punch. Bigby's Hand! 17. Great. I think I'm within range of Lady Kima? I can inspire her, maybe? You know what? Fuck her. I'm going to heal myself. (laughter) Fuck her. Healing Word. Can I do level two? That's 2d4 plus six now? 12 points. Great. Okay. Thanks. Yes. Does he get sneak attack because I'm on the flank with my hand? Is that Fenthras? Points of damage?! Do that Divine Intervention thing again. That was really good. It's ten-foot radius? Ten-foot diameter? It doesn't hit the Hand, does it? Gun jam? All your guns? Why wouldn't she heal me? And she hates me. Larkin's turn. Good old Larkin! Come on, Larkin. Bring him down! (singing) You see him Larkin. You hating. (laughter) What kind of save is it? Does the Hand need to make a save? Hand has an AC of 20 and my hit points. And then Vax goes, "Wait a second, Larkin was a dragon?!" (laughter) Cupping? Trumping right now? Can I Cutting Words that? Am I 60 feet? Would have been great against a fucking dragon. Oh boy. 15. I'm okay. I healed myself last time just the amount of hit points I have right now. You're not unconscious, Marisha? Finally, he gets to attack! It's been six months since we've seen you actually attack anything. Me? Oh, shit. Okay. Against me? Yeah. I'm going to use Cutting Words to reduce the damage. As I see the tail coming, I pick up my book of Shakespeare insults, and I will say with thy brawls, thou hast disturbed our sport! I love thee not. Therefore, pursue me not. Six. And I live. (laughter) So reduced to ten. I'm okay. I have four points left. My turn? I look at Pike, and with my bonus action, I will heal her. Healing Word, second level. I will sing to her, (singing) you're trying to kill a white dragon, just like the ones we used to kill. May your days be merry and bright, and I hope we all survive this fight. (speaking) Okay, so 2d4, right? 13 points. Shit. I've got to get out of here. Are you okay, Pike? Are you going to be okay? I don't want to be a coward. Shit. Well, I'll move away from it. Wait, I'm within its melee? Jesus. That far away? Oh my god. Okay. I don't want to hit it. I don't want to go away. Fuck. I don't want to leave my Pikey. I'm not going to leave my Pikey. You never leave your wingman. No. I Dimension Door away. Over in Yenkville, but not in Yenk range. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. The suburbs of Yenkville. With advantage? I rolled twice. One was a 17 and one was a ten. Pike's alive, and she's super strong. It's all on you. You've got two nearly dead people right next to you who are feet away from a mansion. But you can throw them, as a beasty elemental. When I left the mansion, I locked it. No, it's a code lock. And I forgot the code! On Yenk, of course. He's going to resist it. Retaliation? That's new. Hey, Matt. Can I rewind? Does Pike get an attack of opportunity? I will bonus action take my potion of greater healing, right? That's the medium one? Okay. Terrible. Okay. Oh man, that's terrible. 11 total. Okay. Well, shit. I'll move towards the dragon a bit. There are no options. Not to save our friends! I'm way out of range. I'm done. I've moved. I've acted. I can throw a ball. I'll throw a Fireball at Big Whitey. Centered way back so it doesn't hit any of my friends. Three charges, I guess. What do I do? I just do it. What I was going to say, I rewind. Because you didn't let me, he has disadvantage on his save this time, because you didn't let me retroactively go back and do it. 29. Yes. Do you get an attack because he's flying by you? You are right over him. Advantage? I will come, as well, to make sure Keyleth doesn't kill anyone. What's home? Send up a signal flare. Perfectly executed plan.
