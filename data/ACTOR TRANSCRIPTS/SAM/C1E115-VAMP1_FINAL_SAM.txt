TRAVIS and Fellas! TRAVIS and Storing lots of porn? TRAVIS and You better store it! TRAVIS and Hoard it! TRAVIS and Store those gigs of smut! Baby got Backblaze! (cheering) Backblaze! Check it out. Oh, the new comic! Did you read it? It's good, right? Pretty good. Oh yeah! Good action, good art. It's good stuff. Oh, really? Is it going to have a different name? I'm going to start shouting. Hello! Can anyone hear me? It's me, Sam Riegel of Critical Role! So you got an X-ed-out one as well? One success. Like a mouse squeak? I'm yelling I am an internet celebrity! People know me! Not many people. In obscure corners, but mostly in gaming stores. I'll roll to try to headbutt my way out of here. Three successes! Superior strength? More than all of us. Matt, is that you? What has happened to us?! All I see is wood! Have we gone inside Wyrmwood? Matt! Marisha? Oh yeah, you're married. Wow! Matt! I can hear you! Matt! Matt? A failure is a one. (shouting) Yeah? (wailing) (shouting) I'm worried about my nanny! When I was playing, I had a nanny watching the kids, I've got to get home to the kids! I'm fine! Hey, that was a tough night, but I'm sorry, are you okay? Okay. Of course something is wrong! Look at us! Do we have fangs? I'm looking at them. Seeing Marisha do that, I'm going to find any XLR cable on the floor I can find. I'm going to use it as a whip if I need to. All successes? Sure, yeah. Amy must be worried. Yeah! I don't know. Are you okay? Ooh, maybe they have leftover, what did we have, Greek? Oh, it was Chinese! Maybe they have some leftover Chinese. If we wanted to head to the kitchen, is that the same direction they're going? One success. Isn't a crit two tens? Does it say, "Is it Thursday yet?" Who's they? Are there any telephones around, Taliesin? Don't have the tea. Where's Taliesin? Which way did he go? Yeah! I'm joining Laura. Yeah. Oh. I think he thinks it's "stanima"! Yeah, we're hustling. What does the sign say? Maybe. Do you want to peek out? I'll hold you so if you cry out in pain, I'll pull you back. Taliesin, Laura's going to peek out. But you said we could be light sensitive. Does he cry out in pain or anything? I pull him back! I'm picking up the ashes. I don't know what to do, I'm putting them in our pockets! I start crying. Oh god! What are we going to do? Should we tell Marisha? I think we're alone. We can't tell Marisha, they were about to get married! I'll pile the ashes in the helmet. No, if we break the magic, everything comes back to normal. That's how these things work. (crying) Marisha, I'm so sorry! He's gone! Don't go out the front door. Don't drink anything. Do we get a refund on the wedding gift? Is it an automatic refund thing, or do we have to apply for it? Is Father Chris Hardwick? Hardwick? I'm going to whip Whitney in the face with an XLR cable! All successes. Three successes! Like I feel like I'm seeing trails? Does it feel good? I'm going to back up, cock my XLR cable. Matt and Marisha! Is it a Jordan? Can't kill anyone! I just whipped somebody in the face and they laughed! In case we want to drink them? Or feed them to somebody else? I'm going to try to glamor him. Power? I don't have power; I'm going to try to convince him with the power of my words. Going to say you need to come with us right now. You cannot resist. The power of Christ compels you. (laughter) I watched True Blood. A good vibration? You can feel it! It felt good? Then I'm going to do it again. I'm going to yell at him. You're nothing without us! We keep the lights on in this place! Come with us! I don't know what I'm doing. What? Who's married? Oh, Laura. What are you saying? An alliance? Okay, if shit goes down, I'll help you. No, we didn't say that! We said that we would look out for each other. What do we know? There's some sort of Twitch performance that we have to get to. There's a Twitch show, there's something upstairs, there's weird shit on the walls being written. Do we know what that is? Matt's dead. Marisha's a spore. Yeah, let's go! Liam! We're going to the Twitch area! This is a reasonably sized D&D table now. We have a reasonable amount of people. Did you guys hear this whole thing about the clue? There's a riddle. Were you there for that or is that me hearing something that Marisha heard? When I did my one-shot, I played the same song for 45 minutes so it's just a two minute-- Guys, can I quickly admit that I don't know the layout of the building at all? I don't know the difference between-- Half the people you've talked about I've never heard of. Okay. Sure. Which way do I go? Okay. I'm at the tip of the spear, I've got my whip. I'm going. Where are you? Are you putting it on your face? It could protect your eyes. Oh! You got to mark off that willpower. Is this a portable system? How does this work? This is a riddle, this is a puzzle. We've got three clues so far. I was born in a box. How do I end? Something is wrong. Right, that was the first thing that we read. Is it something is the matter or something is wrong? TRAVIS and And then also, your funeral. This is a word scramble. Okay. In just a straight-- --straight stanima. Two successes. Who gets born in a box? Was Jesus Christ born in a box? A manger thing? That's a good thing. No, this is progress. Sure. All right. I'll try to look for a rat with her. Only one success and one failure with the red dice. I'd say you're dead to me, but-- I'm helping her and while we're looking I'm telling her-- I'm was going to say, I'm feeling very vulnerable. Why don't we form an alliance and if anything goes down, we kick Liam down and we'll run away as fast as we can. Of course. Yes. But Liam's a goner. What just happened? I found a sword! Why don't we all look for puzzle clues? Or should we try to do more to the-- that circle on the ground, Taliesin. How big is it? Big enough that if it opened, we could fit through it? We could put some mushrooms on the head? What would heads not like? Wait, suns cause ashes-- We just found a sword. What if the sword is-- But would silver hurt a head? There's an audio booth here? Really? I know where the bathrooms are! Always. You are huge! Whoa. Five successes, Taliesin. Wow, CrossFit! He needs to be invited in. He's a vampire. We went to the bathroom. Not me Sam. There's another Sam. That's quite a card game. Is he wearing your jacket because you're dead? Sure. Of course you do. Oh boy. He knows things. Which is? (whispering) The puzzle! Me Sam? Yeah, I think we're in the bathroom, right? No, I don't know-- We didn't find anything in the walls? Anything to eat? Yeah, let's go search. As we go, I'm going to tell Liam Listen, I convinced Laura that I'm on her side. Totally. Yes. When she goes down, she's going to try to kick you or throw you down or trip you up, but I'm going to walk behind her, club her in the back of the head, and we're going to make off like bandits. The bookcase is literally the end of my knowledge of the way out of the building. Is there more building past the bookcase? Perception investigation. I failed on a red. Yes. One success. We recorded one at the convention and then I never edited it. Man, we have it right now. It's already done. With some other people. Yeah, we'll do that. Oh, god, what's going on? Oh, okay. Why can't-- looks like you're playing. It seems like Travis should play. He's a card guy. Can we find someone else to play this game? Why don't we go find somebody else to play this game? Are there any others? Where's Max? All right, if I'm not back in 30 seconds... I'll run. I have a power. What's my power? Celerity. Your body responds so quickly that the world around you seems to slow down. Oh wow. I go all over the place. Okay. All right, so I'm going to run back there. Burn that blood. What do I do? What's-- Is it Thursday again? Yeah. Make Max do it? No, we need to do it, so we know. You want me to do it? If I sit down though, will I be able to get up again? All right. I'll draw a card. What could possibly go wrong? The three of swords. More blood? I'm at three. What happened? (gruffly) I don't know what came over me. (yelling) It's on! Wait, I get a question, I get a question first! What? But you know why she's doing this? It's because we made a pact to stick together. She's protecting me. Can I get off the chair that I'm on or no? Oh, okay. I'll stay there so we can ask our questions or whatever. Oh, yes, my question! Can we-- I just killed Max. It's super stressful. Sorry. What did we find out so far? What about the cross? What do we need to overcome the cross part of the puzzle? Are you a vampire? The sun's setting? That's a good thing, though, that means we can go outside. We'll send some more players down here. Thanks for your cooperation. Liam, did you see how fast I was? Just a big T-bone, sitting there in a cage. Always. Oh, he's a vampire. He's seen The Lost Boys. I know that's true. What's that? Two failures? Both red. It was so good. It was so good! It was like a Brunello di Montalcino wine. Laura doesn't know how to read. There's chattering. Let's get our weapons out and go face this threat head on. Why don't we solve the puzzle now, Liam? We need a symbol of faith-- Yeah, we're about to solve the puzzle. Wait. I ate a man. Do you want me to do my super speed and go upstairs and see what that scuttling is? You're eating them? But if we beat the magic, they all come back to life, right? I'll come with you. Do we recognize them? And one red fail. I'm coming in, too. I'm a good person. I'm a fan of your boss. Are you writing something or developing something? As Laura bites, I'm going to take my XLR whip and use it to subdue and put it around the neck of the other one. I'm not hungry. Dex brawl. I rolled three successes for my garrotte. I'm not trying to kill. I'm just trying to subdue. Is it a dude? I lift him up and march him down the stairs for my friends. What is it, Laura? (whispering) I won't. Clean your mouth. Three successes. Don't make a sound. And I am not going to kill you. And I bring him downstairs and throw him at Liam. Have at him! I'm going to take the Smart Girls boy and throw him on the floor in front of us. And then run into the Twitch room. You got no successes on yours? I love how he is a full adult male grown-up employee, but he's a kid now. That was Rachel and Ed?! Oh my god! We're inside of the Twitch. We're here, we're in this room. Are we live on Twitch? Our crew. Liam and I never said which way we had gone. I'm coming up and I'm going to say Big fan-- Is he on this set, or is he at the control board? I'm going to pull out my Wyrmwood gaming tray from under the table over there and hand it to him and ask him to sign it. You killed our dungeon master, so. Are you saying that once the magic is broken, everybody comes back to life again? We do need him for the show. Before you freak out-- I've run a one-shot! I know how to DM! Liam's done a couple! Liam's pretty good! No, Liam's alive! We ate some of them, yeah. I think that's a compliment. Weird, backhanded compliment. You had to pay for this? A little? Well, you know, you could have asked us to come play! Hey, wait! Wait! You're a dungeon master! You could lead the game, right? We need a silver Sharpie. I'm going to speed-dash toward Laura and Liam. Let's get out of here! Let's go out the tunnel! We're going in. Two Matts dead. Yes, but the three new best DMs in the world have survived, so.
