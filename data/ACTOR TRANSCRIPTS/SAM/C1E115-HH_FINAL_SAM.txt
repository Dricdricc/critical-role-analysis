We do have a sponsor tonight. Our sponsor tonight is Marvel Puzzle Quest, friends of the show. Now, here's the thing. I was so excited about the Honey Heist and having Marisha Ray as our DM, I forgot to write an ad for Marvel Puzzle Quest. Don't worry, though. We're in good hands. I prepared for such an event. A long time ago, I recorded a generic ad, so we'll just play that in its stead, because I didn't write anything original. So guys, go ahead and roll that generic ad. Here it comes. Little delay. It's going great. OFF-SCREEN VOICE #1 Hey big bro, what you doing? OFF-SCREEN VOICE #2 You're such a dweeb, little bro. You haven't heard of-- Marvel Puzzle Quest! #2 Dude, it's the best-- Played! #2 --It's so killer-diller, because it's got-- You can recruit Thor, from Thor Ragnarok, and Nightcrawler! #2 --which is way radical! #1 Sounds tubular! Can I try your-- Marvel Puzzle Quest! #2 --get your own! #1 Me? But how? I'm not made of money! #2 You don't need to be, you dingus! You can get-- It's free. #1 Hold up! It only costs-- It's free. #1 Whoa! That's so-- Marvel Puzzle Quest! #2 --for yourself at your local-- This goes on for a while. Let's cut it there! #2 Talk to the hand! #1 Ch'yeah! #2 Yeah! #1 Ch'yeah! That would be amazing. Sorry it took so long, Marisha. Oh my god! No, I haven't! You still can't even open it, now? Security's coming down, they're going to shut us down. Close it, close the book! Oh yeah! That's Matt Mercer with white sunglasses! Don't forget to watch Brian's stupid show, every Tuesday night. Oh my god, she left. Couldn't take the heat. Serious, serious. Stop backseat DMing! Is there any other way to die? Like, if you fall off something, do you die? What happens? (bear roar) Ease into it. Wait, we're in Westruun? Can we speak English? Yeah? Oh, me? I'm Peddy Tuxpin. I'm new to these parts. I come from, you know, somewhere else. But I've been walking around. Checking it out. I like the place. What's your name? You a girl? I look at his junk. Hey, he's not a girl. There's another guy. There's one more guy. There's one more. A honey bender? The name's Peddy. Peddy Bear. (muffled laughter) One. Let me lay out a day in the life of Peddy Tuxpin for you. I wake up. I eat. Bamboo, mostly. About 1000am, I eat. 1200, I eat. Bamboo. 100 through 400 is naptime. 400 to bedtime is eating. Now, I lay this all out for you because I want you to know, what I do with those calories is I crush skulls. I break bones. I rough up people who haven't made their payments. I, well, we can arm wrestle if you really want a sense of what this Tuxpin's all about. Oh, we're going to do this! Paws up! Oh, okay, a one is my better stat. Oh shit! You okay? What do we need a hacker for?! Re-roll. What's your deal? Well, that makes sense. I feel like now would be a good time for me to confess that I don't really like, I've never had honey. I eat bamboo, mostly. No no, I just haven't had it. Just don't have it much where I come from. That would be good? Okay. Did I? I ate it on the way here. I eat a lot. Dress as people? How's that going to work? We all look giant. Well, what do we see? Boss, you need me to do anything? Go, Las Vegas! Go! Oh right, attack? Oh, we got three sixes. That works. You just hacked that hat. You are smarter than the average us! Oh wow! Getting hungry. I'm going to pick them up and eat them. Oh people, we're people, right. I pick them up. I pop one in my mouth like a sucker. It's like a cigarette. Guys, is this plan off the rails already? Should I be worried? I'm freaking out! These people are looking at us funny! But she's so little! And kill her? We're going to talk to her? I'm freaking out. I might just kill her. He said bears. I can't be here right now! No! I can't go up there, I'm scared of fire! Vegas, what you got up there? I don't know what that-- no! I'm not from around here. I'm an out-of-towner. A cart? I can lift a cart. What we do with that? What? That's really smart! I'm looking for anything that looks like bamboo. I'll eat them! What happened? There was a lot of commotion back there! Get that thing away from me; I don't like fire. What? Let's keep following the smell. Did you just self Dee Bradley Baker yourself?! Point of clarification They're holding sticks? Yeah! You have digits! I step forward and crack my bear knuckles and say If you're so sick and tired of it, why don't you make a move? Come on, let's end this right here. Let's settle it. I don't shit where I eat! Okay! That makes more sense! Let's do this! I pounce with panda speed! I throw myself on the stick and I bite it in half! What?! Is this true?! Like, now? This is a spell I can do? Wait, that's this, yeah? When I use this stick, I become two bears? This makes much more sense! But I don't have to use it now, but have this item. Okay, great. I can't bite it in half! I'll just hold onto it with my digits that I have. It's going to take a while. I'm going to eat the second stick. Boss, I know she's within earshot, but shouldn't we leave no witnesses? Do you want me to take her out of commission? Their cows. You said bears. You want me to show them what-for? All right! I'm going to go up and take my stick and knock Bonnie in the head with it. Oh, I've got to roll well. Two! Either way, I succeed. She's dead? This is amazing! I've got a stick that makes trees. Boss! Did you hear the part where this turns into trees?! I feel like this is a more momentous thing! All right. Why's he always leaving us like that? I'm more of a bamboo person, honestly. I don't really-- I'm fine. Oh yeah, I have those sample spoons. Delicate. Nice odor. Has a forward nose. Jammy, but new-world jammy. Yeah, it's got a steely-oaky feel. 12 years, aged in barrel. Good mouthfeel. I like it! Hey, this stuff is pretty good. You know what this is like? Liquid bamboo. What's Crossfit? Succeed. MATT and Killing? We're dicks. Boss, you know-- Do you want to rub him out? No witnesses, right? Vegas. Oh, are you doing a flashback right now? (laughter) I can carry a cart. Sure. Yeah. Why would I-- what? Yeah. Are we going to do a flashback to that moment? Yeah. There's another guy. There's another guy here. You said three bears but there's another guy. Why don't you come out from behind me there, friend? I think you did that wrong, friend. No, it's bear to criminal. Woo-hoo! Marisha Ray! (cheers and applause) [break] Yeah, so next week, I will be hosting a one-shot. I will be in the Marisha seat, and my special guests will be Amy Vorpahl, from Geek & Sundry. Stefanie aka Sofia Woodburn. Yuri Lowenthal, voice of things. Noelle Stevenson, writer of things. Molly Ostertag-- I hope I'm saying that right-- also writer of things. And back for more Jon Heder! They will be having fun adventures and fairytale romance on the high seas. Oh no. They tried to get out, but Vegemite was poured on top. We're right back in it. Let's go get us some honey. I'm going to go right through the front door. LIAM and What? This is where the honey is, right? Come on! Who's she? All right, I know. I'm from out of town, all right? Don't make me feel like-- fine. What are you, though, seriously? Are you a mongoose or something? You're right. I should have seen no gills. That's your audience. One person. Hey, Waffle? There's an exposed pipe here. Maybe you should sniff right there. You know, hack into the mainframe? Sorry. You're huffing it? He can see through the smell?! No, I love it! No, I love it! Keep it coming! Bear master? Beast master? Gold spray paint? (laughter) I've got an idea. I make a tree right in the middle of the lobby there. You use your fire stick. Set it on fire. The whole place goes up. Problem solved! Hey, I'm the muscle, all right? I don't come up with the plans. There are no bad ideas, right? Fail! Half succeeded, right? I can knock it in. Does honey burn? Nothing wrong with being a vegan, by the way. I get just as much protein from bamboo. Listen, it's not my fault that I don't have to kill an innocent animal to survive like you fuckers do. Cows don't count. Sweets! Oh, not like candy. Do you need a tree? Tree. 27? I'm so sorry we're disrespecting an elderly person. He's not a bear, he's a prairie dog. All right, here. Let me give you a tree. Stand back! Stand back, everybody. Boss, how has he earned it? He hasn't done anything. You ready? Okay, stand back, everybody. I smash the stick down on the ground. Success. What kind of tree? Sure. What color would the bark be? Lightish-brown? Fuck it. I'm going to start eating it. Turndown service? Honey service? Does the door look like it swings in or out? It swings out? I'm going to stand in the cavity where the door swings so I'll be hiding behind the door when the door's open, just in case I need to deliver some muscle. Yeah, gopher. Shut up. Stop peeing on my tree. Trinket? If you get in trouble and need me to swing the door and cause some "panda-monium" -- trademarked-- What's the signal? Give me a code word. Give me a signal. Dollars? Okay. Why would that come up in a conversation? All right, I'm ready. I'm going for it! Fail. Take a point to bear or off bear? He's got a kid? That's right. We could put some stuff in front of the door. Is there any stuff around the room? We could. Wait, what did you say, boss? Want me to make a trunk? All right, I'm going to bum-rush him. It doesn't matter. I succeeded on the first one. (roars) Oh, gross. I'm going to drag it inside and look for a place to stow it. I'm going to grab him with my teeth and try to shove him under the stairs. We just met this guy an hour ago. Who will also be portrayed by Matthew Mercer in the flashback? Sure. It's on a loop. How do we get down there, or wherever we've got to go? I'm sorry. It was the one on the left, which is the first one that he went to. The empty one. I'm muscle, but I'm not aerodynamic. I climb up bamboo, I don't-- (screams) Ugh, I landed on my nuts! I've got my stick. What do you want me to do? I've got it. What do we do with this body? Someone's going to see it! There's honey everywhere in this town. Grog Strongjaw? I think I can-- excuse me, this is clearly a panda bear. He's a skinnier version of me. He's black and white. And I will go talk to him in Panda, and I will sort this all out. He's furry. He's got a little fur. He's black and white. He's my people. Why does no one value my opinions here? I feel like I'm offering good ideas-- I feel like I'm thinking outside the box here, and no one's taking me seriously. With what? With your claws? I've got an idea. That dowel rod looks like bamboo. I'm going to eat it! He's got armpit honey. To wake him up? No, you need a nosebleed. I hit him in the nose. More blood! Hey, you teleported that turd to the floor. On the way past, I'm going to look and see if Grog has anything else on him that we can see or take or use. I'll see if I can take them. Super fail. BRIAN and I growl at him. (roars) Yeah! I swing back. Fail. Success! I speak to him in Panda pan pan pan-pan. Pan pan pan pan? Pan pan da da da, pa-pa-pan pan dan. Panda. Panda? Panda! I put his sunglasses back on and pat him on the head. Oh? Do they have the same essence as the stick, or something similar? All right, I'll take them and put them on. Try them on once. (giggles) Nice. I'm going to try them on once. What do I see? What? I put on these human glasses, and I can see through walls. I was not dry-humping him! Dry-hump him? No. Humans can't see movement. Wait, humans can't see movement, but dwarves can, I guess. Wait a second, you're going to take all this honey and give it away? What kind of cut are you talking about here? 50-50? 40-40? 30-30? I'm not the brains of the operation. (laughter) It's always Bear-20 somewhere. (snickering) I don't really care about the honey one way or the other. Honestly, I'm fine just eating bamboo, but I do feel like we put in the effort. This is our heist. It's not hers. If she wants to get cut in, we could give her maybe a thousand percent. I don't know numbers, but a small amount. As a vegan, I'm going to protest that we not harm any living creatures. That's okay. That is not harm. But heavens forbid we actually kill a human being on this adventure. Can you flash us back to that incident? Why would you kill an innocent person? I can't believe you. You're heartless. They're not watching us anymore. I can grow a tree. Can't you hack this? Wow. Who's Vax? No, he said Vax. I think he wants us to tell Vax-- As we walk, I'm going to whisper to-- what's his name? LIAM and Hey, Cookie. I'm getting a bad feeling about this Tova chick. Think she's going to double-cross us? All right. What's the signal? I need signals. Steveland Cleamer? Nice and cleaned. Any honey? Wait, are we sure we want to share this with her? What is this? Do we need these? You guys have to share one. Any guards coming? We have unlimited time? Oh! Las Vegas, come on! Focus! Come on, you damn wolverine. Get the thing! Oh, yeah. It's the fishing rod that's doing it. I'm getting so frustrated that I'm going to start freaking out and hitting the doors. Of course. Someone's above us. I'm going to go for one of the ninjas and attack with my strength. Panda strength. That's a success. That's not. As he's there, I hit him with the tree stick. No. Are you going to pee on the fire? This is not going well! Let's do it. I'm going to head for the door, and on my way, I'm going to grab Tova by the hair and pull her back in. Fail, fail. Dead? I'm going to go get Trinket and drag. No bear left behind! I'm going to drag him out, lay him down. No harm will come today. Like in the Revenant, I will aggressively mouth-to-mouth. Snout-to-snout resuscitation. (heavy breathing) Trinket, if you'd died, I would be so upset. We'll never forget you. I turn to the other dudes and say Listen, all this trouble for some honey. I know a place where bamboo literally grows in forests. We can go there and eat as much of it as we want. We don't have to break in anywhere. There's no surveillance cameras. It just grows! Come with me. It'll be fun. We can turn over a new leaf. Tova, I'm sorry I tried to kill you. I honestly don't know. One of the spells that I accidentally got would've turned one of us into secretly two bears hiding in a bear costume, and we popped out and became two bears. Where do they get the battle board from tonight's game? With that song? We'll talk about it on Talks Machina. Special thanks to our sponsor tonight Marvel Puzzle Quest. Go to bit.ly/MarvelCrit, capital M, capital C. Make sure that they know that Critical Role sent you. And don't forget, also, that you can battle with some of your favorite X-Men, like Rogue or Gambit. That's all I've got.
