Yes. D&amp;D Beyond tonight, guys, sent a lot of talking points. This is not a-- I'm happy. I'm 000045.833 --> 000055.250 happy to honor our sponsor and read all of these talking points, but it's a lot. So I'm not going 000055.250 --> 000100.579 to really do a bit as much as just read them. I had to spice it up a little bit. You guys all know 000100.579 --> 000105.256 that I'm a master of impersonations and impressions and I thought, who better to 000105.256 --> 000111.252 impersonate than the people right here at this table? So I won't be reading these talking points. 000111.252 --> 000114.942 Maybe Matt will! 000114.942 --> 000117.599 Pax Unplugged is this-- I can't see! I didn't rehearse this! Pax Unplugged this weekend-- fuck! 000126.449 --> 000131.990 Pax Unplugged is this weekend, and D&amp;D Beyond will be there. So bring your siggles and long flowing 000131.990 --> 000138.406 hair because D&amp;D Beyond will have tables set up outside of the Adventurers League gameplay area. 000138.406 --> 000142.690 Come and say hi! Oh, but take it away, Travis! 000142.690 --> 000145.039 I love sports games! And guess what? D&amp;D Beyond will be running a roleplaying roulette one 000152.748 --> 000205.063 shot on the Pax main stage, which is kind of like football, hyuck hyuck! Marisha says, so like-- 000205.063 --> 000212.193 sorry. I don't have a good Marisha. So like, you can get more information about the one shot on 000212.193 --> 000221.140 unplugged.paxsite.com or whatever. I'm cool, I guess. It's weird being next to all these old guys 000221.140 --> 000225.096 from like the 80s or whatever. 000225.096 --> 000228.212 Liam will take over. 000229.337 --> 000231.213 I can't read this! 000234.730 --> 000236.876 The one shot game description is Want to know what happens when a group of D&amp;D luminaries 000241.883 --> 000248.376 come together to play completely random characters? So do we. Come join the fun as players 000248.376 --> 000254.305 create characters at the table during the event, using D&amp;D Beyond's randomize feature to improvise 000254.305 --> 000300.522 their way through a classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure. The event will be from 130 to 230 000300.587 --> 000311.954 Eastern Time on Saturday. Aah! Next, and look, it's Sam Riegel! Hey, look at me, I need constant 000312.009 --> 000322.653 attention! Also, D&amp;D Beyond launched their new show, Heroes of the Vale, this week! Join DM Mike 000322.653 --> 000329.696 Mearls, with players T.J. Storm, Todd Kenreck, Shelly Mazzanoble, and more in this new show set 000329.696 --> 000336.556 in the Nentir Vale! I'm an egomaniac! Laura has to add on to that-- 000336.556 --> 000337.618 Oh, check out Heroes of the Vale-- why would she be British?

Finally, last but not least, Taliesin says-- 000402.309 --> 000403.750 He says, <i>Non bagno te, bagno il tuo cuore, che sempre pi√∫ tu mi possa amare. Semper parere</i> 000414.522 --> 000419.985 D&amp;D Beyond! He's a crazy figure from Greek legend! 000420.016 --> 000422.847 I hope that some of that was-- 000425.236 --> 000429.733 We'll also post this in text form somewhere because I don't think anyone was listening. 000434.416 --> 000436.348 There is great stuff and you should check it out. 000437.766 --> 000442.962 Check them out at Pax Unplugged this weekend. 000454.111 --> 000457.815 Sure, sure. 000500.124 --> 000507.332 Woo, Travis! 000610.474 --> 000613.888 That is so cool. 000833.289 --> 000834.407 Is that Jester on the cover? 000835.515 --> 000836.376 Wait, who does it say it was written by? 000844.646 --> 000848.165 That's his pen name. 000850.736 --> 000852.370 I thought it would look weird. 001048.456 --> 001057.230 What can it do?

No, 14 to hit. 003611.448 --> 003616.416 All right, well then I'll just keep running down the plank and then use bonus action to dash 003620.780 --> 003622.227 another 30 feet. 003622.227 --> 003636.697 Okay. 003738.655 --> 003750.267 19 for me. 003757.025 --> 003757.855 I've never seen Travis this nervous before. 003809.289 --> 003810.596 Is that how that works?
