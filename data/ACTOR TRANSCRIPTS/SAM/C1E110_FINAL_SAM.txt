I was just learning how to DM from Matt about a minute ago! And I think I know. Sure! My players that I will be controlling-- that's how it works, right, Matt? My players will be the talented and charming Liam O'Brien dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger; the charming and cabbage-smelling Brian Foster; friend of the show and charming everything, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn; young Ashly Burch, pulling some shit out of her ass, I'm sure, which is going to be awesome; and then a player we have not played with yet. He's a lovely voice actor and a talented man Eric Bauza. Look him up on IMDB. He's the voice of everything. He has never played Dungeons and Dragons before. Merch, Laura-- oh. Is there a book update? Is there a sticker update? Is there a shirt update? I think we've stalled all we can stall, right? By the way, the reason Travis and Laura are not here is because we all brought our dice and our little character sheets to Indianapolis, and they left theirs at home, so they drove home to go get it. I don't actually know. I'm laser-focused on my shitty one-shot. We're also doing Wednesday Club, me and Liam. We're going to be talking about my favorite book, Hellboy. Are you James Lipton in this equation? We're essentially doing an episode of allworknoplay right now. Should we start? Maybe by the time you're done-- Okay, we'll start from announcements again. He didn't say anything, but he did a great impression of you. A professional is on time, Laura. So we're going in? Into the giant? I will be lucky Pierre, right in the middle. Before the great war thing? But only tiny bits. Maybe it's "no fur." Maybe we should leave Trinket. I'm just saying, that's the furriest one. I don't want Trinket to die. How does this work? How much water could a titan hold? I know, but is there a barrel of water in his chest? Sure. But maybe they're all hypnotized or something. To do what? But we're in it. We're in it! Oh, we're playing Pike? You two? Okay. Maybe? Dex, huh? 13. I drank a tiny little potion of healing. I healed six. What did this mean? Did this mean we were supposed to follow him and split up? Let's split up, anyway. That is a decision, sure. Wow! We're already at a battle map! Well, how were we going to have a feast? We were in a big board meeting and then we came here. 18! Great Weapon Master! Assassinate! Uncanny rage! Okay, I will rotate around the guy with the red ring around him so that I'm between him and his friend. (singing) I'm living on the edge! (laughter) Sure. Oh. I'll inspire Grog first. Because I'm about to hit you. I will sing, (singing) Hey now! You're a Grog-star. Get your axe up and slay! Hey now! You're a Grog-star. Get your rage on and rage! All Laura's dice are gold. Now a d12 can be rolled. And then I'll do a 3rd-level Thunderwave. Both. It's 15 feet from me. Yeah, it's from me in a 15-foot cube. That'll be nice! Yeah, sure. Oh shit. Yeah. What did the second one roll? Oh fuck. Okay, that does. They both take 4d8 damage, and the one who didn't make his save gets pushed away, but he's right up against the wall. Double damage?! Terrible! 12 points. Oh shit, if I move away, he's going to take a swing at me, isn't he? But that would be wise. No, I'll shelter in place. Yeah. I will swing my sword at it with advantage, because I just inspired someone, and Mythcarver has that feature. The first one was better. 17 plus ten! I actually don't know. It says it's a plus-three longsword. Does that mean it's 1d8 plus three? So it's 1d8 plus four. And then I rolled a one, so that's five. But it also says, somewhere in here, deals an additional 1d6 force damage! Oh yeah! One. Shit! On a retreating enemy, I get to cast a spell. Oh shit. Everybody dies. He's going to the phone. He's checking his texts. I will look for you! V, S! Do you get to reroll ones? Did they make saves? So they get pushed as well. (whispers) No bonus action? Why don't we just leave? There's no one here. The sky? Are you doing the splits, right now, are your legs--? We're all holding our shit? Nothing's going to show? Which way were we going when all this shit happened? Should we be trying to get out of here? I will go 25 feet the same direction Grog went in, because that's all I can run. I'm sorry, Matt, I'm sorry. I'm going to go in the opposite direction. I don't want to be in this fucking cluster. It's a mess up there. I'm going the opposite direction. I don't care! I'm getting away from you fuckers. And I'm turning invisible. (laughter) Oh shit! I don't know these things! And as a bonus action, I will Healing Word myself. Huh? Oh, first, because-- So I would do it first. Seven more forms show up. Grog, you're inspired. He can't see me. Don't worry. (laughter) I'm mocking him. You said "I want coffee," and you got coffee? I want ice cream! Is there a guy next to you? Your Hunter's Mark sounds like Didgeridoos. Or rain sticks. Don't worry, you'll be sleeping a lot at Burning Man. I will use my insane climbing speed of ten? (laughter) I will hold my attack until I see something come out of somewhere. My Wand of Magic Missiles. You didn't intentionally roll it. And I say from the top of the tree, I don't know who you're touching, but I'm up on top of a tree. I'm invisible. (laughter) Yes, I know. It lives, for now. I was holding my action; I could blast the bear with my wand. She wouldn't even know where I was coming from. (whispering) Oh, she's right. (laughter) Break all the glass, go inside. I just hit 18th. Let's do it. In what realm of possibility are we not going into this thing? Have we ever done that? There's a king in there? Mountain dwarf? (laughs) Double Pike is the best Pike. Hey, for hit point counts here, I'm under the impression that we had some bonus hit points from some speech or something? Do we heal those as well? Which we did not do. Time is of the essence. Need some help in there? The gift was the adventure. So, there's literally nothing in here? Or there's still a sarcophagus? So, we should open the bronze door? Right? I could. Okay. I'll go inside and I'll open the door! Is it locked? I'm going to check for traps. I think it's 20. Sure. Oh yeah, maybe you should pick the lock. I'm right next to him. 18, for me. But you won't let me cast Greater Restoration? I will cast Greater Restoration. On Pike. But I have to roll another constitution? 13. I'm stuck like this! It didn't work! Oh god! Take its weapons. I'm going to check the floor for any pressure plates or anything. Okay. That's a lot. 30. Just work from the floor or from the-- She might be able to sense good and evil, no? Or is that for creatures, not for-- That's for creatures. I can look at it and just look at it. I'll look at it. Just looking. 12. 22. Wolverine? What's your hammer like? Oh, that's pretty cool. No, but I mean, how are you going to wield this? You have two other weapons, don't you? Sure, go for it. Let me look at that. I have no idea what that is. Are you going to unattune from something to attune to this? Then what is it? Next time? We're about to go fight fucking Vecna. Well, that was fruitful. Let's keep going. Who would be buried with a cursed belt? I think it's a great idea. We're gods now, we can do anything we want. They haven't permanently killed any of us. He's just a nice old man. (gravelly voice) Don't go in the crypt of-- (laughter) It was holding a baby. Ooh. I don't even know how to pronounce that first word. How do you pronounce that first name? Cinc-ture? How do you know that? Oh, it's like, people still make these things? Oh, I've never seen that word before. Well, I'm not proficient in it, weirdly, but I am an arcanist. Seven. Four. I mean, it's ten. Yeah, but it's still sucky. No we're not fucking waiting for-- You will win Matthew Mercer's wood tonight. No? You should go see it? Sure, yeah! (whispering) Dagger, dagger, dagger! Kill it! He's using all the maps we didn't use in Indianapolis! I am drunk! (laughter) Matt, will you leave all this stuff for me when you go to Burning Man, so I can use it? Thanks. What's going on in here, guys? (screaming) 11. How did you do that? 21. The break doesn't exist. Insta-death. That's with the double? It's a crit, right? I'm going to use Cutting Words to take that down. That's all right. I will yell at the troll Oi, troll, I would kick your ass, but I don't want troll shit on my foot. (laughter) Eight. Constitution saving throw. Me? Oh god. I'm not wasting my shit on them. Yeah. 16. That's a 26 to hit. Yeah, 1d8! Three! Plus four, that's seven. Oh, but wait, there's more! Plus four. 11 points of damage. Like a matador, I turn my back to him, because I don't think he can hit me. I don't think he's got it in him. I don't remember them. When were they? You mean subtraction. (laughter) Yeah, of course. Yeah. That's pretty good. 23. All right. Jesus. There's all these people around. All right, I'm going to step away from the troll, and I'm going to light it up. I thought it was frightened! Yeah. Ooh, natural 20. It's still my turn. Fireball! Wand of Fireball. To that troll who just hit me. I was backing away. I asked! Is it that big? Oh shit! Well, then yeah, I'm smoking them both. Sorry, friends! Absolutely Grog. I love my Trinket. All right, you're right. Then I'll hit Trinket. It's a wand, so I'm using three charges. It's 10d6. I have zero d6 right now. I don't what happened to mine. 40. Yeah, and to refresh, that's a wand. Does that still use my spell slot? Yeah, it regenerates after a long rest. I have to roll for it. It's got several charges. It's got more in it. Well, let's go plunder the loot. Well, look who's back in the fight. Say the thing that you wanted to say. The door's covered! That's the one we need, though. This is on you, Grog. No, don't use any spells. Don't use any spells. Grog, punch through this shit. Don't you need to know where you're going for that spell to work? It's a big city. What would that tell you? Is the hammer called the Stop Hitting Yourself hammer? It's going to be awesome! It's all set in the world of Alice in Wonderland. No! Any Critters who are on the playa with these guys, they will take off their clothes if you ask them.
