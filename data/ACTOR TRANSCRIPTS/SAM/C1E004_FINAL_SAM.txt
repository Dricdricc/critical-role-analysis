Hi, mom! Clarota. Yes, that's wise. We follow. We do follow, yes. Oh God, we're dead. I'm coming with. It's just a roll? Not great. Nine! It's a nervous habit! I'm sorry! (all laugh) It's a gift I have to share with the world! I also have low light vision. Nope. Not so much. Don't worry, it's a friend, we'll bring her back soon. Keep him busy. He likes slow jams. Oh my God. Lady Kima, the one we're trying to find? Me and Pike are like-- It's so great to see you, you look fantastic by the way. Bring it in, bring it in, give me a hug. Ooh, you smell a little. I like it though. Somehow it works on you. Yes, yes. And we found a rogue one, and we may team up with him-- or her?-- to go back and get revenge and maybe kick some ass in the camp. So welcome back. Great, sounds like a fun time. So we trot back over to the dead goblin village. It's personal? Girl talk. Uh. Let's find out. (all laugh) What am I adding to this? Oh. 13. I'm not an insight person. Yeah, the eyes, the eyes. No, the helmet is what separates him from his hive mind. It wouldn't help us at all. Can you bore two like, ghost holes in? How about Clay? Question, Clarota. Strategy. Number one, that assortment of dwarves and some of your friends and ogres over there on the other side of the chasm. Is that something that we need to face headlong, or can we maybe surpass them, trying to find K'varn, or this temple that you speak of? "Bring him," so you won't be accompanying us on any adventure, or...? And the general is in that... Yes, yes. So we have to go over. We'll get there eventually, but first step is this smaller force across the chasm. Well, the general's right across the chasm. I don't think he knows about me. It's water and magma. Oh yes, down below, in the waters, our allies - Vex, and uh, somebody. (all laugh) Found some creatures under the water, snatching bodies as they fell. Keyleth. Yes, I forgot who went. Pike's beauty distracted me, you shouldn't have cleaned her up so nice. Anyway, there were some creatures down below in the waters, are those anything that we could use, or should we just avoid them? Do you need a lozenge? (all laugh) It's a gnome thing. All right, so let's review our options, shall we? We can't charge, there's a chasm. Master switch. We could fly in, right? We can fly in death from above. Well, we can figure out a way. Enough of us can turn into flying things to get you there. Or we could disguise ourselves somehow. What? So, hold on-- (static) (music) There's music. Pike, don't toy with our emotions. We have. We been there and we quickly retreated. Lake? No, there's no-- what, there's a lake? No, that's rushing water, that's not-- What's the best-case scenario? What, we come up behind them? It's still gonna be a fight. We can fly over them, that seems like a pretty good attack point. There's an ancient death thing down there. I don't know, man, he's volunteering you. Or some sort of disguise, distraction. Two hours and 17 minutes, that sounds like Lost or something. Do it smart. Let's go bomb them. This is not just a lake, there is a death monster in there. If we go under the water, we're dead. And we'll be underwater, where there's a death monster. Well, then let's come up with a good plan. And what clear thoughts they have been. We can fly overhead and just Lightning the shit out of it. You know what-- wait, wait, if I may. When I was there, I saw the main general control all of them instantly, when he was about to make a sacrifice, or feed, or whatever he was doing. No offense. He instantly had all of their command. If we could somehow get to him, and cut off that connection, distract him, influence him somehow to command them to all jump in the lake, for instance. That would get rid of a lot of them all at once. I can get you there. I can make you unseeable, but not invisible. I can make you a fly. What's he doing? Touching the hat. We don't even have a laboratory. I assume that would make us pretty blind as well. -- sunglasses? (all laugh) Before we build sunglasses-- But I thought we established that they don't need visual contact to influence us, they just need to be able to be aware-- You may not know the answer to this. I don't doubt your knowledge and wisdom, but I happen to have a ring with mind shielding, will that aid me in any way? To burn? Or I can hang that big brass pot on its head. So wait, I just have to blind it? Well, I happen to have a Blindness spell! Could it still control the others, though? So you want me to go in there, solo, invisible, and try to blind this thing. I'm in! We can all get there. We can all get there. What is it? That's a suicide mission. Surgical, special ops, seal team six. Oh, Vex, you look so tired. She's so like that. (all laugh) ASHLEY Let's do it. Wait-- (shushes) I'm gonna sing a little song to inspire a couple of my allies here, if I can. Okay, forget it. Just doing my vocal warmups. ♫ Me me me me me me me me me ♫ ♫ Molto bene, molto bene, molto bene, molto bene ♫ Is Clay awake? (all laugh) Clarota, do you know what that rumbling is? Ooh, still. 14. After her two natural 20's. The rumbling creatures. All right, we've all rested up. I had a crazy dream. It said if Geek & Sundry got to 1,400 followers, there would be some sort of a giveaway. Wow! So the plan is again, you and I, stealth. The rest, attack with light? What's first, what's second, what happens here? I'll make some fire for you. Fly, flea, mosquito, dragonfly, whatever you'd like. Or I try to blind it with magic. Might I suggest one other wrinkle. Remember there are some dwarves being held captive. We can make our way to them and release them. Grog, we understand, you want to bash some things. All right, is there anyone else in the party who could help us with stealth, or anything? Okay. So we gotta go into the barracks. So we gotta get in, and then get in. How are you going to get Grog over there? How do we get it over there? Yes, you can fly him, right? -- that we will try. (all laugh) Let's set down right in the middle of the thing. We all have to get there. Yes, but where are we going to make land? In the middle of the shit, next to the barracks? Okay, then you and I can get in the barracks. Question to the dungeon master. I think my Polymorph spell is a concentration spell. I'm going solo. (sighs) I can get you in. I can make you a fly, but I can't be invisible at the same time. We're going in. Yeah, let's go. Wait. Wait. We're trying to sneak over them before we land. Don't cast Daylight on anything yet. We don't wanna be bright and shiny in the sky. I'm gonna sing a little ditty to inspire Vax. ♫ I didn't see the Vax ♫ 'Cause he's so goddamned stealthy ♫ Da da da da da da da da Yes it was. (all laugh) Are we all in flight now? And the carpet? What about Vex? Is she with us? She's staying behind. I wanna see how you fly, Grog. It has been an honor. Only one of us will die. And it won't be me. I can be invisible. (all laugh) Thank God. 15. Wow. What? Siege? Don't say anything. Whisper to each other. Shut up! Just wait 'til we get there. The barracks. With a roof? But we're still in the air, right? He's gotta concentrate on that. Yeah but he's-- Him flying. Should we land on the roof? Or do we land right outside the barracks door? What do we do? You guys wanna stay up and we'll go down? Yeah? I'm so scared right now. (all laugh) This is the exact conversation they had when they were about to go kill Osama. (all laugh) Don't ask a woman that! You light up on the roof? Let's look for access first. Don't light up 'til we give the go aside. By the way-- By the way, Clarota-- Clarota you have definitely picked the right people to assist you. We got this! All right, let's go land on the roof. 30. (groan) So some of us need to go inside. We look around for any roof access. No chimneys. We're gonna go-- We can see the window, we pick one of the sides, I don't know, west side. Is it a single pane? Is it an openable window? Oh, I turn invisible. Don't roll a one, please don't drop me. I have a climbing kit! (all laugh) We can't talk to each other. We can't signal each other, and we don't know where each other is. I hold his hand. (all laugh) I'm not gonna talk back to you, so whatever you say. Can I hear him? From thoughts only, can I hear him? I notice that his hand is weirdly cold and sweaty. Yeah, that's, we tug each other. I mean, I'm invisible, and I rolled a five. 13. This is so romantic. Oh man, we're doing-- we're flanking! That's pretty good. We can take these guys, I'm not worried about that. Wait. What are those red things right there? So we're trying to get there. This is straight up Metal Gear. (all laugh) You got my dice. What was that? Remember every 50 subscribers gets a free giveaway. Easy, easy. While I'm invisible, I look around for traps. I'm just gonna see if there's any trap doors. Not great? Nine. We can't communicate. I step forward into the room, and I hurl it at the fucker's face. The mind controllers. Wait, do we get the plus ten to stealth? 19. Bucket of shit! My dexterity? No, no, strength is not higher for me. Oh, it is higher! So 19. Attack, attack, kill him! We're going for the general? Let's kill some bad guys. 14. Gotta get inside first. Unless Grog can just tear through the roof. What? 15? Pike! Oh okay, thank God. Which you don't know. Is that guy the general? Scanlan. 14. (yells out) Ah, I'm so awesome, Pike! (all laugh) Oh. Toys. Come on, do something. If they don't make their save. What? Come on iPhone, come on iphone! iPhone five! This is the Fifth Edition. What is this madness? Magic in them. To death? Crazy room! But you said half. I see. Oh, okay. I'm going to, (groans). God there's so few people to kill now. (all laugh) Okay, I'm gonna cast Dominate Person on the general. I'm going to Dominate him and inform him, I can give him a command, right? Yes. I'm going to tell him to stand down, and tell all of his allies to stand down. Okay, on his behalf? Do I add mine? 11. (sings along with the music) Oh yeah, Clarota, thanks for all the fucking help. (all laugh) I'm gonna stay where, well, I'm gonna move just a couple feet away from the guy right behind me, and I'm going to, as my bonus action, might as well give Grog some dice. And also just tell everyone, remember, let's not kill the general, we need him for information. That's it. I also take a little poo in my pants. This is still-- A battle? Even though. No combatants? He's under my spell. So that'll break the spell. Oh no. Be quiet. That is a 20. 22. No! Whatever? It's a dragon! A potty break? No breaks tonight! Just pee on Ashley, it's okay. Guys, this is so exciting. And Laura has no idea what's going on. Oh! That's my girlfriend. Damn it! Clarota, worthless! Shit. He can do that? Oh, he broke out? No no, he just broke out, right? Where is he? You have one dice from me. I've inspired you. (singing) Grog. Grog. If you have a shitty attack roll, add a d8 to it, if you have a shitty roll. Whoa. 57. Sounds nasty. Dicks, bring it. It's getting hard. (all laugh) Are you flirting with it? Ooh! He has so many dice, it's crazy. Critical Role by the way, name of the show. (all laugh) I'm ready. Okay, I'm going, I know he'll get a hit on me, but I'm gonna run away from the guy behind me, run straight at the general, and just open out my arms in an outstretched big hug, and I'm like, come here big guy, come here! And I give him a big hug, and upon touching him, I cast Banishment on him and send him to another dimension. It's okay, it's all cool for Pike. Does not hit. DC? Well, if I'm doing it through my cone, it's 19. Oh, he's gone, oh, where did he go? I don't know. It's concentration. (all laugh) Do I get a bonus? Okay, I'm just going to sing a little ditty to Pike, just to give her a little inspiration. I'll just do some pelvic thrusting-- a little (guitar), that's a flute, by the way. (all laugh) Why don't you have a rhinoceros? Oh jesus. Oh no! Do I? Come on, kill him before he gets to me. He's coming back from the other dimension. I rolled a nine. No, I used the one that rolled on the floor. Dungeon Master, does a roll on the floor count? What happened? It's even worse. (all laugh) Playing my shawm. Cutting Words reaction. Six. No worries, I'm just at negative 36 now. (all laugh) Yep. I'm being thrashed around. I gave you a dice. I gave you a dice. Don't chintz out. Cast whatever you can cast. Can you do it at a higher level? Let's not cheap out on Scanlan here. Remember when my kiss healed you from death? Just throwing that out there. That's three. I thought that was three, no? Plus five. But now I'm only negative 11. I've taken almost 100 points of damage in this. Hey, I feel great, guys! (all laugh) Oh shit! (all laugh) Hashtag, armored anus. (all laugh) I must have stopped concentrating for some reason. We're droppin' like flies! Jesus. Oh, Percy's dead, hashtag save Percy. I haven't signed it.
