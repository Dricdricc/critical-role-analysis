D&D Beyond just released-- this is actually kind of exciting-- just released the new Creatures section. Users now have a place to add any type of monster stat block for easy reference during play! You can add your favorite wild shape or familiar forms, keep up with your ranger's companion, summoned creatures, mounts, ferrets-- or what do we have, a weasel? Followers and more! You can also track hit points and customize the name and stats for all of your creatures! To celebrate, I've crafted a quick little trivia quiz for Laura! We'll start with Laura and bounce around. I searched through D&D Beyond's list of actual familiars listed on their site. I will name four creatures. One of these is actually a board game. The other three are actual D&D familiars. Which is the board game and not a familiar? A) Boggle, B) Juiblex, C) Pudding King, D) Unstable Unicorns. Incorrect. I said, "Which is a board game and NOT a familiar?" Boggle is also a familiar! Unstable Unicorns is the correct answer. Taliesin, one of these is a West Hollywood bar-- Three of these are D&D familiars. Which is the real bar? The Naughty Pig, the Mantrap, the Steel Predator, the Cockatrice. Is a real bar! Correct! Marisha, one of these is an Australian candy. The other are beasts on the list. Which is the real Australian candy? (Australian accent) A nalfeshnee? Musk stick? Ochre jelly? Vegepygmy? Vegepygmy. Musk stick. You got it correct! It's actually a candy from Australia! I'm going to skip the next one and go straight to Travis. Sorry, Liam, you lose. No, I'll do Liam's, too! One of these is a Kama Sutra position. The other three are beasts! Which is a Kama Sutra position? The Flying Snake, the Curled Flower-- Curled Flower. The Stench Cow, or the Corpse Flower? Kama Sutra's sexy position. Yeah. Flying Snake! Curled Flower! Stench Cow! Corpse Flower! Curled Flower is-- Speed round! I'm still going! Travis, I'm going to say pairs of names. One of each is a World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler, the other is a D&D familiar. Grung or Mojo Rawley? Say the one that's the wrestler. Grung or Mojo Rawley? No. Manshoon or Fandango? No. Leucrotta or Lou Albano? Correct. Annis hag or Gran Metalik? Correct, and one more Giff or Mirt? They're both beasts! I don't know what any of these things are! I did a lot of research on D&D Beyond today. It was fascinating to scroll through the list of beasts and familiars! I'm on this show? Did they pay me? Brian has to pay me to be anywhere within 500 feet of him. It's the rule. We're doing the rage room tomorrow. It's going to be fun. Yasha's first. We're all 60 feet behind her. I guess I'll scout with Jamedi. TRAVIS and May I put up my cloaky thing? Did you cast Pass Without a Trace? We're all within the-- Okay, 24. Me, and-- Who am I out there with? Cosko? Three. Plus zero. I'm in the front. Makes sense! No, I just styled it a little bit differently. Oh, that's nice! You've been past here before? Maybe we should go investigate just in case there's an early warning system or something, and there's someone in there watching us? Us?! All right. I'll take a big swig and go towards it. Yes we can, Captain. We're supposed to be listening to her, or something. I don't know. Want me to go knock, or you? All right. Okay. I'm going to sneak up and peak through the curtain. I can look for traps. I'll look around for traps on the floor and stuff. Investigation? 13. Then I'll use Mage Hand to reach up for that box and grab it off the shelf. Does the magnifying glass look like it might still work, maybe? I'll grab that. Mr. Clay, should we go in further, or what do you think? Why don't you go check it out? You don't see the cot. What? The chest? I can come see if it's trappied. I'll Mage Hand check for traps. Wow, so far today, I've rolled two threes and three fours. No, it's going to pay off. 13. Okay. I'll open it. It's not trapped, for sure. Well, that's better. 24 total. I'll grab them all! Maybe it's just a silly prank, it's water. What do we do? I mean, yeah, I guess I will try to not get hit by the cluster of snakes. Save? 23 to save. They didn't feed the trap snakes? Do you want them to decompose? Maybe? Were they real rubies or was it all a ruse to get me to pull on them? Do I have them? Me? 12 Okay. Let's go tell the others about everything that we found, except for all the rubies and gold. I'm kidding, we'll tell them about it. Unless you're cool with not telling them, because that's cool with me, too. All right, you're confusing. I found those beautiful eyes of yours. I can't-- I found two rubies. Yes. Like this. Oh, there's a golden snake, I forgot. What do you have that you want to identify? You don't trust her? Hey is there any benefit to showing-- I whisper-- is there any benefit to showing Captain Avantika that letter we found that she wrote? All right. What's Fjord doing right now? (laughter) (yelling) Fjord! (spoken) I whisper. (laughter) I don't know. That's why I'm asking. I'm a simple goblin. I don't know the world weary ways of a sailor. No, I'll just hang on to it. If she ever is like, I don't know. If we ever need it, we got it! Never mind, we were just talking about this letter, but don't show Avantika. We can use it to copy her handwriting and write a check. Oh, of course, I should have asked you first! Thank you. Let's go, let's keep going. Oh, what? 29. Is he a human? Beauregard starts glowing. Do you share this knowledge with anyone? Natural 12. Trying to open candy. Were there any flowers on our journey? Flowers. Did we pass any flowers? I'm going to pick some as we go. You need me to speak to Avantika and Jamedi? Sorry, what? Oh. (whispering) I'm on the phone. Recast. What do you need me to say? You can respond to this message. Oh! Got it. (whispering) I'm on the phone right now, okay? I'll get to you when I'm done. (normal volume) Okay. That was Caleb. He wants me to go distract Avantika and Jumanji for a moment. Do you want to come help me? What should we do? We've practiced one. We could try to teach it to them. Great. Ahem. Hoy hoy! Hi, Captain Avantika. Oh, sorry. Sure. Hi! Yes. Something that-- Hi, it's me, Gilligan. Nice to see you again. Something that we used to do on our ship to relieve the tension. LAURA and Was we had a boat dance. Do you guys have one of those? Oh, sorry. He's a ninja. Don't! Not you. (whispering) There's four lizard people up there. We should do this quietly. Just for fun, but let's try it! Yasha and Fjord to the right. We'll go to the left. This is the ultimate Godzilla movie. That was the greatest plan we've ever had. We flanked. The battle was just over! So put our two clerics in front? Who do you think should be in front? Kind of. I mean, is that rude? Do you want to ask them with that stink face? Okay. There's no facilities or anything. It's like a tent. I mean, don't feel like you're obligated-- On who, our friends? Mr. Clay. You've got this, Mr. Clay. Clever girl. Find out about these beasts on D&D Beyond! Look at these palm trees! That's someone who was drunk at night and was like, "Let's just do this thing!" And both of our clerics-- Oh, someone roll for Yasha. We're going to eat that whole box. Nott's sitting at seven. Oh, I'm at eight, actually. Eight. Eins, zwei, drei, vier. On D&D Beyond? Wow. Picking your dice. Wait, like unconscious or asleep? Hey! I heard Mr. Clay. Let's go. I'll scramble out, going into the direction that I heard the sound and seeing all these folks over here. Do I see the beast? I will kneel down and pew, shoot it in its hindquarters. That's a miss. 12. Reload. Fire again. Wait, do I want to do this? Nope. I'll keep moving and hide behind that wall. Yeah. Bonus action hide. Okay, that's a 28. Sure. Still 28. You're at one hit point! You're going to be fine, Jessie. You're asleep. Is this a spray or a cloud? So it goes around walls. 17. Reckless, Great Weapon Master. Is she that? I don't know. I'll climb up over the wall and take a shot at the one remaining leopard. A pew pew. 21! Advantage! Well, that's a weird roll. I'm going to do that again. It's still like 21. Yeah. Ugh, terrible. That's okay. 15. Damn. All right, I'll reload and shoot again, this thing is-- Great. 26. And then this is not a sneaky attacky, right? Much better. 11, and I'll use Fury of the Small to make it 16. Oh, you know, maybe don't kill it. We can interrogate it. What did you use to attack? I shot it with the thing. Oh my god, that's so visceral and amazing. I'll shoot it in the nose. Oh. Jester's asleep. Quick! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Fjord! She needs some mouth-to-mouth. We won. Are you okay? You don't look very good, Mr. Clay. On yourself? Are we going to leave the two dead animal bodies right here, next to where we're camping? Because that could stink. Okay. What were you guys doing out here? No, but before that. Why did you come out here? I will whisper to you Why did you come out here in the first place? Why were you walking around in the dark, alone? I'm whispering! Oh, all right. I'll stay up with you. You said "pyoop." We're inside the bubble, right? 12. Go to the creature tab on D&D Beyond. Not that kind. Dutch oven. Upper thigh? Who? Oh gosh. Did we get a long rest? Oh good. Why? Yeah. Mr. Jamedi? What are we going to find when we get there? Are there any baddies? The giveaway just happens now. We don't have to say anything. Oh we do? Awesome. Oh no. What? I think that was my-- That was my seventh four of the night. Laura reminds me that I roll with advantage so I'm at a 30. Wow. Stealthy mofos. Does it look like the figurine that I recovered earlier? Give it to Fjord again. This is his day. Do you feel okay? Maybe it's a human thing. Is it tea, what is that? We're trying to get into the center of this, all of this? Sure. Sure! Some us can. Yes, yes. But not these two. As prisoners. They're humans, they're disgusting, filthy pink skins. Oh wait, Yasha. Can you change your appearance? We could make a distraction. Some of us can snakey. The ones who can't change can go first and we'll make a distraction and then the ones who can can just walk in after. You'll have Yasha with you. And Beau to protect you. They won't have to be sneaky if we make enough of a distraction, right? All right. All in favor of that plan? That's one vote. Can you make a distraction far away from us? Oh boy. Are these guys painted green? Is that what we're doing? It was good before! I'm going to grab Caleb and be like You're going to be fine out there. It's going to be fine. Just think like a lizard, right? I'm going to take some flowers and just stick one in his hair for good luck. I don't know. It's good luck, though! What?! What?! No, but what? Shit! Why are we following him, then?! No, they're gone! Why are we following him? What if he came here, was killed, and was sent to come get us to bring us back as feeding for whatever's down there? Ah! You're still here?! Shit! Did you know? Where are you? Is Jamedi here? 18. Avantika! Did you know he was dead? Did you know he was a dead guy? Has he always been dead? Is this a recent thing? Where are you? Why? She's going to be in a defensive stance for most of the fight. Oh, I get advantage. 30. No! 38. She's a lizard person; she'll be fine. You're going to be a loud snake person. That's fine. Yeah. Yasha can speak that, no? Want to do a distraction now? We should kill them? TRAVIS and Okay, Yasha. You and Yasha should pull them off the street. Are there any doors around here? Let's just go in? Will they wake up if we hurt them now? I'm shooting with a crossbow. 22 to hit? 17 damage. Jesus. Oh boy. Set fire to the house? Is there any hole in the ceiling or anything? Is there a roof? It was a suicide. Like, can see us? On us, or on the--? TRAVIS and Great, let's run. This is going to be great. Just had to beat a ten. Jesus. Oh, nope. Do another. Oh boy, this is going terribly. I will step forward and say to the beast How does the Lucidian Ocean say goodbye? It just waves. And I'll cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter on it. You'll need it. Spell management! Roll for Yasha. 20! Ooh. MARISHA and On the dead guy? (exaggerated Arnold Schwarzenegger accent) Five points of damage. Is there an entrance to this tower? Many people. 20. Like blood? We're still out in the open? Should I check for traps? For sure. I'll check for traps. 18. Investigation. All right, I'll unlock it. That's 28! Tumblers? That was not supposed to work! That was luck. That was dumb luck. Probably not, but I can try. Hey, how great was New York Comic Con? We met a lot of great Critters-- And thanks for everyone for coming out to the live show, and we'll be back again next year? I don't know. I locked it! One at a time. Why me? I'll take a big swig of liquor and start going down, scanning for traps. Oh, that's shit. I only rolled an 11. 11 for investigation. Coast is clear! Let's go! (running) Weee!
