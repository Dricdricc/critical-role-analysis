Reenact it for us. Two? I only prepared one. What's happening? D&D Beyond, everybody. (clears throat) D&D Beyond is our fabulous sponsor, they're here every week. They put these things on our iPads-- I mean, our tablet devices that help us track our stats and stuff, and they wanted us to let you know that this week, Matt Mercer's gunslinger fighter subclass is now available on D&D Beyond. In the character builder, critters can begin creating their version of Percy right now on D&D Beyond. They actually already have started creating their own versions of Percy and loading it with the features that we've come love about Percy. I've compiled a list. It's the Top Ten List of Percy Features Being Added on D&D! Everyone, a little, light drumroll if you could. Number ten extra long, pompous names. Number nine skin so white it claps on the ones and threes. Number eight bags containing gunpowder and Victor fingers. Number seven that feat where your dice always roll 20s even though they're not cursed by a demonic ritual. Number six blue hair dye! Number five steampunk bifocals. Number four giant bathtubs that comfortably hold a female half-elf under the water for 15 minutes. You can add these features to your Percy. Number three throat bubbles. (laughter) Number two wit and tact. Wit and tact. And the number one thing being added to the gunslinger class knives. I got it working. (laughter) I can move my guy now. I looked it up on Google first. I'm going to hide some stuff up there. We'll hide some stuff. They're used d20s. I don't think the store can handle that many. Charity drive? Guys, the birthday girl is trying to talk. 23. Is the giant in melee? Would I get sneak attack damage or no? He's not engaged with anybody right now. Okay, then I will shriek and I will run towards Beau, full sprint. It's north, east, west, south. Sneak attack damage is so good, but I can't. That thing can see me, I'm scared. I'm scared, guys! I'm going to fire my crossbow. Ooh, it's a two, it misses. I'm super scared. Oh yeah, probably. Eight. Then I will run back the way I came. No, like behind Yasha, behind that pillar over there, that wall. North always points to the star. (laughter) Okay, not too hard to hit. Go for it. Yeah, you so badly want to. Look at you, you're a killer. Turn into water! What? You wanted to. Her plan was to hit Molly. It was a weird plan. But wait, you get to dispel magic! (sighs) Do we heal, or do we get this guy? No, I mean Molly. All right, I'll clock around the corner and fire off a shot. 20 to hit. Okay. Ew, terrible. Nine points of damage. No, I'm not a-- You can perform one of these (mumbling) use a bonus action to control the hand. Fuck. Okay, I can't cast Mage Hand as a bonus action with Legerdemain or whatever, right? I can only use it. Okay, then I will fire again, why not? Natural 20. (cheering) Does that double my dice? Plus that's 16 points of damage. Then movement to clock right back around that corner of the-- Yeah, of the structure. Yeah, right there. Yep. (strained) I'm dead. I was thinking about you. Not the critical?! She could be perma-dead right now. What's your total? Just super-duper unconscious. Whoa. What, you're back up? Hex damage? That hits. Yikes. It didn't work. Damn it. Okay, that's not good. My turn? I will look up at the giant man who just hit me and I will take out a tiny piece of pastry and let it crumble to the ground and look up at him with fear in my voice say Why don't-- (sighs) why don't goblins eat court jesters? Because they taste funny. I will cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter. 13. Yeah. Oh. Why isn't this working? Can I please get the changes to take? Yes, okay. Okay, that sucks. I will bonus action disengage! I will run away! Just the maximum amount of running away I can do which is only 30 feet. Towards Caleb, to the north and if I can get behind that pillar. Other side, possibly? All right. Go heal Yasha! Go heal Yasha! You can do whatever you want. You can get it over there. I'm going to take a healing potion. Then I'll walk around the other side of the pillar so I get a good clean shot. Am I within 30 feet? I want to be within 30 feet. (crossbow loading) Ready to go. Are we allowed to attack, or no? We weren't holding our action for when they-- I guess we never said it. Oh, fuck. I thought it was implied, we were just waiting for it to wake up. 23 to hit. 22 to hit. That is 13 points of damage. Trying not to hit Yasha or Beau, I would love the bolt to go through its belly as far as it can go. LAURA and Do we win yet? (chanting) Nott, Nott, Nott, Nott! As we walk by, can I try to untie the old guy's shoelaces? 20. But how will I drink? Does the shoe fall off? Our Dolan. She knows her history. Hi. I'm just Pam. Was this person in the conversation I was spying on before? Okay. To a better tomorrow! He's going to die tomorrow in war. We all are. Didn't I tell you guys? There's a war starting tomorrow? I overheard them. Yes! We're all going to die. We should leave now. No, you should. You weren't with us the night that all this went down, so they would not suspect you of anything. Just ask them about what happened the other night and the Crick that they killed. Who they work for? We know who they work for. What do we need from them? Oh! Why don't you just act like you know more than you do? Like, (gruff voice) Whoa, I hear war's coming tomorrow. What about that? Abort, abort, abort. Super cock! I ran a half-ikithon once. What information did you glean? Why? What happened? The Kryn is the kingdom over there. Yasha. Just so we know and can-- I trust you. But if there's anything that we need to know, now would be a good time to tell us so that we're not in danger. Are you a Xhorhasian spy come here to do bad things to the empire? Well, why are you here then? Why did you flee? Well, I want to know in case they're going to come try to kill you and kill me by accident. Plausi-mon-a-mon-a-minity? I just want to know if you're on their side or the Xhorhasian side so that when this war comes, that we're not caught in the crossfire. That's all. I'm on my side. You mean what they're fighting? In Xhorhas? The Kryn? Did they do bad things to your people? That sucks. Did you know anyone who went? Should we divide up the money? Great! East. I have limitless alcohol. Well, you offered him your services. I would've said yes if a strange psychoanalyst walked up to me and-- We need some healing potions and things. What is the Silken Terrace? Okay. What's the mission for tonight, though? Yes. 228. It's still your birthday! (cheering) I mean, we're going to the Pillow Trove. I support you, Jester, but I mean-- Okay, then let's go there. (whispering) Oh, manipulation! We're out in public, and we're in front of a hotel. Do you want me to try? It came? I'm sorry I doubted you! Do we typically tip when someone-- Two gold? Jesus! What services are available? The best available. Yasha, if you were to partake of a companion, what kind of companion are you interested in? Is it like a beast type of a thing, or-- Maybe it's a check. Beautiful handwriting. Yes, of course! That's nice! Marian? That's a beautiful name. Chanel! Color printer. That's a lot of money! For all of us. She gave you 5000 gold before? Did you tell her that you were out of money? And this is all she sent? Maybe. I don't know your mother, maybe she was testing the postal system. Sending a small amount as a test. You can write back and say, "Got it safely, feel free to send more." Maybe that was it. Because I wouldn't want to send 5000 gold over the mail system. There's people out there who steal the mail! The most important thing is that she loves and cares for you, and wants to support you from afar. Those are the absolute most basic you can have. Mostly paper is white, too. I don't know how it works. Wait, just so I'm clear Do you get a full release massage while you're eating a steak or something? I rolled a 14. Message received. Huh? Nothing. I didn't say anything. I was practicing a new catchphrase. That's why I'm practicing. It's a little heady. Yeah. Hey, you know what? Did you order the room service yet? I think the phone's broken, so maybe me and Beau should go deliver the order downstairs. Oh! We didn't eat our rats yet! I mean, they'll die! Oh. Should we toast now? Uh, no. No. No. Give me your rat and I'll have them cook it and bring it back for you. I won't eat your rat. Do you promise not to kill me in my sleep because you're a Xhorhasian spy? If I don't eat your rat, you can't kill me in my sleep because you're a Xhorhasian spy. All right. Let's go order some food. As soon as we get out of the room, I say I was told to bring you to Caleb. I don't know why. Sure. Right, it does take a while to deliver. All right, we go order food first. I'm going to send a few Messages out. Caleb, what room are you in? Caleb, what room are you in? Caleb, what room? Oh, okay. He's in room six. (knocking) I brought the monk. Are we discussing some escape plans? Excellent, let's go. Tomorrow, right? When they're open. Sure, yes, whatever you want, Caleb. It sounds serious. Trash person. That means you, too, Matt! What does she want from you? Of course. Absolutely. Right away. Whatever you want. But why? Oh! From your town? How old were you? You were just students? Did you go in after them? Fake memories? Wait, there was a false memory? He tricked you? But you didn't know what you were doing-- You were brainwashed. Programmed. What do you mean, hidden? I don't think it's-- You want to stay here? Good evening. I go over and I throw my arms around him and hug him. I'm so sorry. It wasn't you, it's not your fault. It wasn't you, you were made to do it. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. I know you don't realize that now, but you will. This pain that you have, that you wear all over you like a mask, it's just that, and you can take it off someday. I know it hurts, but it wasn't your fault. I'm going to keep telling you that until you believe me. What you did was awful, truly terrible, despicable and unforgivable-- until you can forgive it. At some point, you'll have to do that. I swear to you that I will be at your side until you do. Really? A lot of books. I'm in. Whatever you need, just tell me and I'll get it for you. Fart jokes! You're cleaning up. Laura and Travis went home, they have a-- Yeah, Dateline was on? Oh, no, Ashley's gone, now. It's just us. It's morning-time now. Are we all back together again? Over breakfast? Like, continental, or like French toast? Insight check! 11. I think she's lying. Before we leave, shouldn't we get a lay of the land? I mean, I trust my own ears, they're very large, but I barely heard half of a conversation. I don't even know really what's happening other than I heard that there's a war happening. Well maybe we should do some snooping around town and find out if there indeed is a war before we leave town. We also have allies here. We have The Gentleman-- Dolan! We haven't even checked in with him! We have a bunch of allies. We can't just up and leave without at least saying, like, we're out. I have never had allies before. Because those are funny-sounding names? It's also where there was a string of kidnappings. I don't like this idea. Me, too. It's a more festive atmosphere? Insight check. (choking) Do you wear makeup? I think it's worn off. Should I be-- Do you think I should be more of a normie for this? That's for when we steal things, and I pretend to be his baby and he pretends to be my mama. Then when they're looking at the cute baby, he steals something. I'll be a dwarf. I can disguise myself as well. I'll cast Disguise Self and be a little halfling girl. Veth. How about one more hour? We'll all compromise. Of course, would you like a drink? Are we allowed to drink in here? Why are you carrying around a cup? Are you reading these things out loud? Caleb, when you were muttering there, did you say Dolan Tversky? They're in a different campaign. I'm half sea monster! We're going to go to Pumat's as well. Healing potions, do you have any? How much was it? Is it one use only, and then it's gone forever? No armor, not even light armor? How much are those? Maybe not, forget that. Do you have any enchanted crossbow bolts? How much are they? I'll take two bolts please. Thank you. Nice. Okay. 1d8 fire damage. Great. Okay, cool. What did we decide? Are we leaving town or are we doing something else? Caleb, do we want to stay? Are there things here that you need? Or we could just leave. Well, Beau, do you want us to stay together? All right. Yeah, maybe we'll rustle up W.C., Loo, John, Crapper, Shitter, and Toilet. In the interest of time... Do they have any? How much? You can make potions of healing? If she has the materials to make acid, I'll buy it from her. Should we go say goodbye to somebody and leave? Fjord! I'm coming with her. It's not you. It's us. We're not ready for that kind of commitment. You're going to make an adventuring party very happy some day. Does anyone know what a Hawker is? So many choices! Pros and cons. Investigators! That's our job! Do you need some tea or something? A lozenge? I don't, I just feel bad for her. Forever. Think about it. Huddle up again. What does that mean? I roll a d8? I got a seven. What's Uncanny Dodge? Sneak attack bonus 3d6! Oh shit. All the dice. You can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you?! Holy shit. I'm unstoppable! Can I use that once a day? Once a round? Once a round?! Holy shit. I'm a golden god. So does Yasha, no big deal.
