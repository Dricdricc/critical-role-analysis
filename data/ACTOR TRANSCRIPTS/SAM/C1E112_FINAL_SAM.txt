We love Marvel Puzzle Quest and they love that we love them. In fact, Puzzle Quest had a bunch of critters come up to their booth at Gen-con to say hi, and they wanted to thank the community for being so awesome and welcoming. The game is legitimately awesome. It is so awesome, it is so epic that me talking about it doesn't do justice. Really it needs another artform. One that is an amazing theatrical experience and expression of joy and emotion. It needs opera. So combining Puccini and Marvel Puzzle Quest, I give you an operadvertisement. Shit, that music. No, it's okay. This is going to be terrible anyway. (singing) The new SHIELD clearance level nine lands today, bro. Better rewards and challenges you can recruit Lockjaw the inhuman doggo. For more chances to summon Black Bolt, other Inhumans, and Kamala Khan, and boost the power of your superhero squad. Last but not least, for a limited time you can also recruit the Silver Surfer and Thanos and Star-Lord and the cosmic legends pack. (speaking) Oh shit, I forgot my props. (singing) From now until the 30th of September. Marvel Puzzle Quest. Marvel Puzzle Quest! (cheering) Hey, how do you say it? Is it Dalen's-- Thank you. Jesus. It's only on PalmPilot. I love it. It does need more Scanlan. It's a good start. It's like season one of The Office. Pretty good, but it gets way better. American. You know, medium. Am I handsome again? Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm boring. I bore you now. I'll get a tattoo. How many more of those do you have? I'll go behind Percy. Famous last words. 30? I have the sphere. We haven't moved very far. Sure, I'll bring it as far as we've gone. Now it's three. Sure, but we're just walking here. Simon Three. It's going to reveal our position, isn't it? We can put one on the Sphere? Disguise him! Put him in a hat, gloves. Oh, so now we're legit. Okay, great. Send it straight at them, then. It could curlicue up. But with you by my side, your engineering wits and my ball-handling skills, we'll be fine. Or does it have a radius where it stops listening to me? Let's give it a shot. Let's find out, right? I'm going to concentrate on Simon Three and send it back the way we came. Not hitting anything. Just to see how far it goes before I lose telekinetic connection with it. Is it still going? How far away is it now? Okay. Come back! It obeys me because I asserted my dominance. That's one way, right? Can they see each other? Wait, what? Can see the source? The names of the people we killed? We know their names? I could be one of them. I have an orb of destruction next to me that would seem like his. Sure. We just killed him, right? Which was the one who was controlling the orb, though? I won't be alone. I'll have Simon with me. Send who down where? How far are they from us? But you people have to be near me when I do this. How is that going to happen? TALIESIN and Is there anything to hide behind? Wait, an actor prepares. Who am I? What's my motivation? Am I Odell? If so, why does Odell have the sphere with him? Sure, I'll show her. I'll show all of them! I like this. Good backstory. Wait. Who's Viscon? Which one is he? Yeah, but he was running away. He wasn't the one holding the sphere. It was the green robe guy. Wait, we have the actual robe? Just give me that. Property of Jimmy. "If found, return to--" I thought green! So we want the red? Did we ever hear his name? Viskorad. My name is Viskorad. I'll just use the same one. We know the other one was named Odell and he's dead. So I can go over to them and say, "They've killed Odell." So they need to go get what? Okay, but what is the thing that we found? Odell is still down there. He needs some help. I'm going to go talk to Vec while they go help Ode. Right? I'm going to put on my Hat of Disguise and become as close to that man's form as I can. Wait, was he a human? Was he an elf? He was human? Moles and trolls. Red leather, yellow leather. Wonderful. We have the jenga. We can do the jenga! We kill everyone. Yes. You're going to be in triple digits soon. I am going to limp as I go. Strong choices, commit to them a hundred percent. I go to the one that had that knight near it, right? I'll go to the middle one. I'm going to keep the ball in front of me to obscure me a little bit. Not dead in front of me, but it's up here, just in case. Hanging my head a little bit. I'll go up and say Power! So much power! I've never experienced anything like it before! Come! I need aid! Okay, first one was better. Ten, plus-- what is this? TALIESIN and 28. So far it's going great, guys. We were tunneling with the orb, and we found something. An ancient, dwarven artifact. It bends reality. It changed things. It changed my voice! It changed my whole world for a moment. It's still down there. Odell needs help! I have been injured. Take the orb, go down to where we were, down that way. I will go get help for myself. Odell needs you to help him contain the power. Yes. What am I going to do with a fucking Sphere? Wait, we're supposed to cave in shit?! Goddamn it, why didn't you tell me this plan?! I'm not the best at this game. Well, they can move faster, but they won't have the orb with them. Don't you think the thing that the big thing is guarding is the better path? The guy who talked to me, is he still here? Okay. Which archway did he come from? LAURA and Okay, I'm going to go up to the middle one and say Excuse me, big fellow. I have to get by. 25. I'm going to go in through the archway. I'm going to go a few feet in. Do I see anything? It's stairs? How far can I get before I'm away from 60 feet? Well, I must have gone with them and then gone forward. Well, you better fucking move forward. No, I'm at the threshold of the entrance. I take a knee. (groans) I'm okay, I just need a second. (whispering) What's going on? What's going on with my brain? (groans) What's the plan? Okay, you can do this, man. Stand up. (whispering) Lead him away? Where? I'll start back. I go back through and I say No, it's too dangerous. They need help down there. I fall down to one knee again, and say Ugh! Damn these legs! You must go help them! They'll die down there! Can't you see it's getting worse?! The pain! Just charisma? 23. Wouldn't it seem odd if I started singing to myself? How? You're 60 feet away from me! Sure, I'll inspire myself. Why not? Oh, I get to roll something. Ooh, another eight! That's robotics law one, right? They're idiots. Just go! That we're about to go into. What about the 60-feet thing? Who are you going to stealth-kill? They're probably getting down to Odell at this point. We should hurry! I'm still at the door, and I'll say No! Get away from me, you interlopers! Evil-doers! That's right, you infiltrator! (screams) I'll run, but I'll say No! No, don't take me with you. I need to stay here. Approaching us? Or we're approaching it? Who are you people? What do you want with me? Your first time's always disappointing. Children. Why would you want to scry on me? If you did, you would've seen this a big black sword. I'm a little guy. Look, it's bigger than my mug! For a joke. Is it a roll? No, it's a thing that happens. Who are you people? Let me go! I'm innocent! Oh, that's true! (fake sobbing) That is my backstory! But you wouldn't be able to help her find it in a necklace. Is it the direction that we came from, or the direction that we are going, but down? We don't know if there's even any catacombs or anything down there. It could be buried in solid earth. And it could be a thousand feet down. If only we had some sort of sphere! Shit. But when it catches up to us, we'll take it back! Simon? Answer your master. I can't. Yeah. Gate Stones? They're not Gate Stones. I have one. Underground? She'd have to become a different form. She'd become an earth elemental in solid earth. And change your form into an earth elemental. But you would be a mist. How would you tell her anything? How are you going to see? And if you can find a place to pop back into existence 30 feet away. But she knows where it is. All right, do it. No, she cannot. She won't be able to see her. If you're ethereal, you're in a different plane. Why don't you go find it and come back and tell us? Okay, let's go. Every ten minutes? That's useless. The Locate Object only lasts ten minutes. 240 feet. That gets us 480 total feet possible in two hours. Halfway. And we might not get there. I do. Stealth team is not me, right? It's you two. We're also committing that this is where the mansion is going to live for the night? Is this a good spot for it? No, the mansion can't be seen. They would have to know that it's there. Well, we can hide it behind a closet or something. I always carry a closet with me. You have advantage on this? 25. What did Pike get? It is visible, so is there a closet in here or some sort of alcove? The entrance shimmers faintly and is five feet wide and ten feet tall. You and any creature you designate can enter. Investigation, I got a 23. 22. Harry Potter lives there. I started reading Harry Potter. Yeah, I'm on chapter three! If we drink wine tonight, it will only be in remembrance of you. Or to get snookered. Does that burn your spell? Are you done? Poor Ashley. You're abandoning your sister? Back in the mansion, we're all sipping wine and I'm saying I know our friends will come back to us, and I know that they won't ever lead anyone here. Shit. (laughs) We need Whoopi Goldberg. "Molly, you in danger, girl." And here's cucumber salad, everyone. There's some dill. "That's my turn. " (laughter) How's it going outside? He knows where you are? Did he know where you were? And did he know that you came over here? So he knows where we are, so we have to leave now. Yep. But then we have to leave or be ready to leave at a moment's notice. Or we should maybe leave right now. And then what? Then we all have to leave. Earth clear? (laughs) Everclear. Best episode ever. She's back! Is she back? Do you have the sword? We have to move. The safehouse has been compromised. He doesn't know we're in here, but he knows where the mansion is and he will come to dispel it. So we have to get out of this mansion and either make another mansion somewhere else or go to somewhere else from inside this mansion right now. To this exact spot? Music just got supes loud. Wait. What? Weapons training. He's getting dice. A lot of dice. A lot of dice. Vax or Vex? Swords and dicks. Just wants to kill Vecna? What else is he into? You look like a methhead. I want to see one of those before-and-after meth photos of Grog. (laughter) What is the plan? We're in the Feywild, where there's werewolves and pixies. I don't know that. I aged but didn't know why. He was not our friend. He was an asshole. Wasn't he the guy who sketched us and was creepy? Fair point. I lost my house today, all right? So go easy. It's insured. We took a stone? Wait, why are we finding this Artagan fellow? He can control the land? The powers of the land? Garmelie? You don't say it, you have to write it down? Ashley, will you draw something and show it to us on the camera? I think it's a vag. Is this thing going to kill you? Can you read it? He came that fast?! I unzip my pants. (laughter) Is that something you can control? And what would you request? I'm pretending to be a mage right now, so. I'm a crime lord. I can get you really good discount furniture. He's into autoerotic asphyxiation? Mere passage of an hour? That's good, yeah. Can I ask one question first? Will you be pleasuring yourself during this? Oh. I respect you so much. What is that? How do you activate it? The place that we're meaning to return to is moving. Could you send us to a moving place? Can you send us back? We have to send ourselves back? Garmelie? I don't remember being in the Feywild at all, or meeting him. Right? Oh, that's right. But does that restore memories? Can I pleasure myself? Yeah? We have no choice, Pikey. Do you want to stay, too, Pikey? This is weird. This is like a weird snuff film. Sure. You'll be fine. This will be harrowing for you, but you'll be fine. We'll bring you back. This is a sacrifice. I look away. No, not at all. What the fuck is this? I'll scoop up everything. I'll make a little circle of rocks. I don't think that that would be a good time to do this. I don't know that. Are we going to rest here? Do we have to wait a whole day before he comes back? Anything else we can accomplish here? Sylas. She said Sylas is alive. I don't know what I was going to say. Armor fluffer? I need to accomplish something. I don't know. I have a spell, and I can use it before we rest, but I don't know what to use it on. Well, I can do a few different things before we sleep. We can go out into the woods and find an animal, a big animal. I could turn it into something, like a flying thing that we could give to Grog so he could fly. Fly with that sword. Like a wyvern. Sure. A big animal. I would love to turn Trinket into a wyvern. (laughter) Yes. Yeah. Forever. Did he say yes? I knew that. I can speak with animals, too. (laughter) All year. (laughter) Or-- Or I could do other things. I could do other things. I could make another compatriot for us to have in battle. Like another Scanlan. Or another Pike. Yes. Or I could do other things. I don't know. Never done this before. It's a crazy spell. But if you could fly-- Yeah. You could bring that sword to his neck. It's a real thing. Magic would not stop it from flying. It would be a real thing. Sure, but it couldn't be dispelled with magic. No. I can turn you into an eagle. Another Scanlan who could easily be destroyed. Well, it'll be a magic thing that could be dispelled. That thing couldn't. That would be a different spell altogether. There's other things, too. I could cast a spell on one of us that if you died, it would activate, and it would heal you. No. But my Death Ward would last for ten days. No. I mean, I could, but it seems like a shitty use-- If there's two of me. I can't cast Haste. I don't know it. Who does? LIAM, LAURA and Oh! MARISHA and Can the episode title be "Dicks and Dicks"? (laughter) What? Is that true? Show them support, show them love, guys. They really appreciate it. Tweet at them, follow them on Facebook, add them as a LinkedIn friend. Sext them.
