Hi! Is there a time limit on those, Matt? Two weeks?! You mean the people out there have only two weeks to get this t-shirt? Will you tell me this. Is it made of fine material? Is it a handcrafted t-shirt? You heard the man. The two weeks is ticking now. Slightly less. Wait. Marisha. Say thank you for that thing. Oh yeah. But that would be over there somewhere. I threw the card on the floor and took the scotch. Oh! It's-- sorry. "Hi, Geek and Sundry Crew! So while this package is actually mainly for the Critical Role "cast, I hope that they share it with you guys, too!" Oh, I guess that means these guys. "It's a small way of thanking you for all your hard work "for bringing us Critical Role every week and making my life a bit more bearable. I would so "appreciate holding off on giving this to the cast until the entire party is there--" Sorry Liam. "I "should've also sent you a note for the cast, through Twitch to go along with the package and it "would be amazing if you could ensure that they get it along with the package. Keep being awesome! Prometheus Theus." Then let's wait. Hey, Travis. Okay. What do we got to do? Should we play the game? Okay! Everyone! Settle! Settle! Let's play the game! But we have to do this quickly. Okay, how many items do we have? Oh! What's-his-butt has something. Vax has something. Jesus. Nice. What is that? What does that do? I need that. What? Can the ladies grow a beard? What does it do? So it just gives you one more 3rd-level spell? Thank you... Vax I have something. What is that? How is that... is this better? Plus one. I'll take the armor. What does the ring do? What's your AC? Mine's a 14. 15. All right, you take it. I'll just die a lot. 15. Well wait, I thought Grog was taking the beard. Take it. It's a belt, we can just-- oh, but we have to bind it to us. No, no, you take it. We divide everything up? Oh, yes. The Concentration Circlet? The pearl, yes I did want the pearl, but... what? (confused laugh) What does it do? So does that mean on one round I could cast a spell and also activate the spell that's stored in there? I've never run out of spells. So it gives me an extra level three slot? Let me think about it. Let's think about it and strategize. We'll do this tonight? The three level spells I don't use as much as these. But, if that's what you'd like... Well. You did Silence me that time. You didn't have to. He liked it. You also abandoned the party in our most dire moments. Yes, so if I abandon you all and come in at the last minute and take the last shot, I get all the credit? I don't think so. I'm so sorry, I missed the last part because my awesome hat was blocking it, sorry. We'll discuss soon. I go back into Gilmore's and I ask if there's-- if either they or someone else they know can make a specific kind of potion. I forgot to ask-- Hello, Gilmore. You look particularly perky today. I was wondering if I could inquire about a specific kind of scrying potion that I would like made for me. It's a specialty item. I don't know if any exist. Oh! Is that patchouli I smell? Gilmore, when we get excited, I-- well, never mind that. Anyway, I'm looking for a way, a potion that I could maybe drink or use, to help me look in on a place that we've been to recently. I could maybe leave a mark of some sort, and then use that mark to magically scry into that place. I have a dark side. So I would be drinking this potion and it could affect me in other ways. All right. And how much would such a potion cost me? Wow. Did I give away my ruby last time? How much would this get me? I don't have any dice! (laughs) 23. Oh. 21. Just tell me how much it's worth first. Do I sense that he's lying? Where'd it go? Thank you! Ooh! 11. (laughter) What? Yeah, let's do it. I'll give you the ruby for the potion. But I would love a hefty amount of a potion. Not a single use, but multiple use. That would be lovely, thank you, Gilmore. One. One wonderful day! One glorious day! More. More bigger. Ooh. Why must you dicker? Hi, you're back! All right. Shall we start adventuring, then? Two days, oh, we're not leaving yet? I was mostly spacing out last time. I'm going to inspire him before he makes this roll with a little inspiration song or something. (sings) Whoa, I hear you're tinkering, whoa, please do it well. Take my hand and you'll tinker I swear. (sing) Tinkering on a prayer! Can we just send our minions to get it? Like our servants. Did you have a bathroom break? Whose? Who? And your nails have been painted red. Red nails. Like Fox News. Can I be with him just to watch? Okay, I'm with you, Grog, just watching. Can I jump up-- I jump up on a table and I say, Listen, you motherfuckers, my friend just asked you a fucking question, now fucking answer him or I'm going to kill every last motherfucking one of you! Is this a 20? I rolled, that would be a 30. Oh wait, no. Yes, 28. I added wrong. 28. Thank you for your forthrightness and honesty. Sounds awful. You said up north, how far? All right. Anything else you'd like to know, Grog? Thank you for your troubles. Here, let me buy you a drink. You, my friend, have good taste. For you, anything. Hey, grow a beard tomorrow morning. Oh, we've never done one of those before. No, it's a percentile dice. No, just one. Oh. Do you think it's the model plane I ordered? Oh. In the last two days, have I gone back to Gilmore to pick up my item? Excellent. It's a potion that, when combined with-- when consumed, can allow me to leave a mark of some sort that possibly I could use to have visions of what is in the area. The mechanics of which I would not like to get into at this moment. Any chance to talk to you, Gilmore, leaves me happy beyond compare. I am offended, and terrified at the assumption that I would sink so low! As to spy on my good friend and future wife Pike when her pantaloons are down. Not at all. How dare you. How dare you! Have I ever spied? On a member of our current party? Current party. Okay. Okay. (laughter) I just wanted to make sure you remembered. Purple-grey. Okay. I've got it. Great, thank you. What if someone tries to-- What if someone tried to hit Trinket with a salmon? Let's go. All right. To the Council! All right. Let's go to the Council. Hi, nice to meet you. Was it Vorak and Desona? Lovely to meet you. I'm Scanlan, I'm sort of the de facto leader of the group. My second. Hi. And you'll be accompanying us on this arduous journey to the nor-- where are we going? We're taking an airship of some sort. Were we supposed to bring that? Kima, you're coming with us as well? I pull Vex aside for one second. Yes. Before we go on this quick journey. We trust all the people who are sending this along this journey, right? We trust the Council? No no no. Huh? All right. Good to go. I'll take the girl. Airship. The airship's called Deera. Deera? Image Capture? That's a thing? Nobody likes a selfie. Captain Damon, just morbid curiosity. Are you married? Do you have a steady girl? Never mind, we'll talk later. Yes. I can see my Keep from here! Shirts, shirts, shirts! Two weeks and counting. 13 days left. Oh, well, when you made me something once that was really cool but I think that was a spell. Hey, you know what we always need? What we always need? How to carry Trinket on the goddamn carpet. Yeah, but we're always like one body short of being able to pile onto the carpet. It's fine, we'll be fine. Don't waste your money. I rush to Captain Damon. What the hell just happened? Also, are you married? It's Daenerys! Tiberius, your brothers are here! I'm just going to keep rolling until I get a better number. Wow. Oh, I like that. Oh, wow. I like how all of our viewers are just looking at our midsections. Yes. Yeah sure, that. We got your damn 20. Eight. We always get the lowest. No, he won't die, he won't die. The wyvern caught his rider. Well it's the ocean, right? Might end up not hitting... Just winged him. We're just letting that guard die, right? We're not going to try to... Ah! I'll take a few steps towards the action and I'll cast (sings) Bigby's Hand, Bigby's Hand, you know it, shamone. On the griffon. Is he above the boat or just above the ocean? Can I use Forceful Hand, it says I can push. Do you think I can... twist? So I'm going to dump him over. Oh, and this is all through the Hand Cone of Clarity. Of course. 19 plus five, 24. I'm also going to inspire Vex. With just a-- just for her archery skills. Okay. (sings) Elvish people in the ship tonight, everybody just have a good fight. (laughter) I am so hard right now. I mean, Scanlan. Were you hurt? Thanks, Pike. Of course. The griffon is grappled, too. Well, not grappled. With inspiration. We're not doing well. Leave some for Grog! She'll be fine, she'll be fine. Lotta questions, lotta questions. Nice. Did you take the wyvern or the rider? Is that a thing? My head is like a shark's fin. Natural 20. It's the birthplace of the Constitution. No, I think it's Philadelphia, it's Philadelphia. Oh my god. Vex, I've inspired you. Not Damon! Oh no, not handsome Damon. Oh, no. Scanlan's going to take a few steps forward-- But he got out of it. So I could... I'm going to leave it be. Oh wait, I still have my hand out? And it's over there? Can I move it to the other guy near the ballista? Yeah. Is that going to be my move, or do I also get to use the hand? Okay, I move it near the ballista guy and I just go, boop. Push him over the edge. It's through the--ooh. Not good, not good. 14. Oh, it worked! And then-- I'm going to move towards the captain. And-- Vax, are you in dire straits? Physically? Okay, then I'm going to throw some healing at Vax with my Healing Word bonus action. Healing Word of the day is, Heal! (laughter) You got healed seven points, New Jersey. You've got inspiration. (sings) This is the music that plays when things get really exciting. And he misses. Matt, do everything now. Polka, polka. Lots of polka. Trenton. Scanlan? Oh. The back? Just do the best move you've ever done in your life. Wait, is it just the d20 plus the modifier? Okay. That's 20. Two athletics checks. Instead it was just okay. That's fine. And I sing my little Cutting Words song to-- I'm sorry? Oh, he has two attacks? Against the stinger. Oh, he hits. Okay. What do I roll? Zero? Ten, okay. Ten. That goes down to 14. My armor class is 15. I'm also wearing a necklace which makes it 17. So I'm okay. From that. Well I wrote the armor and then there was apparently some necklace that I forgot about. Amulet of Natural Armor, I didn't realize. I can give it-- (sings) And you miss me like the deserts miss the rain. It's the ice damage that's going to do it. Ooh, cold. Oh yeah, that other wyvern was gone for a while. Don't worry, if you fail I can intimidate him. Her. Does she have an arrow through her arm? She can replace the guard that they killed. I'm going to go through her pockets, make sure she's not hiding any weapons to attack us. Oh, that's so sad. Teera, empty your pockets. I give her a quick pat-down to make sure she's not carrying any daggers or anything. Sweet. I take it. He means he'll throw you overboard.
