Marvel Puzzle Quest! Mazel tov Puzzle Quest. Marvel Puzzle Quest is available now on Apple and Android devices. The latest update adds Riri Williams, a.k.a. Ironheart. You can check it out at bit.ly/criticalmpq-- that'll be posted all over the place, but I got a chance to play this game, and let me just tell you, I'm a pretty good gamer. I just loved being able to play this game through. I tried it on a PS4, I tried it on a PS3, I tried it on Xbox 360, because I'm a 1337 gamer. I tried it on Steam Engine, because that's how you get games, and it was amazing. You can play as all your favorite Marvel characters, like the Avengers. The Avengers include characters like Elrond Man, Nick Furry, Red White and Blue Shield Guy, the Hulch, and there's other characters like Lord Star, Dice Man, Carnage, Aunt Man, Professor Triple X, and the Medical Team; that's what I call these characters called Dr. Doom, Dr. Strange, and Dr. Octopus; they're all medical doctors and they all fight for good. There's Kamala Chaka Khan, there's Juggs or Not-- (all laugh) That's the names! You haven't played like I have. That's the names of the characters, I'm pretty sure. They all have PhDs. It makes sense. I'm 1337. Is this like a Columbia House thing where you keep doing a new subscription? Wait, we have socks now? Socks Machina? It sounds pretty stupid. Can mine have garter belts? Thank you. (singing) In the morning. Not good. What does that mean? We are very hopeful now. Maybe the lair or something. I'll inch up a little, still hiding behind those outcroppings there, and then I'm going to call out the dog. I'm going to summon the dog. I just say, "Good doggy!" Right? And I throw the figurine. I forget-- we never figured out his name. We know it, or something. You said-- it was very cryptic. You put a badger down? Badger doesn't give a shit. Maybe we should just leave. I'm going to really quickly whisper to the dog, "Do you see anything that we don't?" Good doggy. It's not invisible. She's not there. 21. 21. That's one egg down? Aw. You're terrible, Taliesin. You're so hard-boiled. We won! Yes. Yes! I turn to face in the direction that my dog is looking. And... shitballs. Who's that near me back there? Okay. Vex I will inspire with a quick limerick. Gern Blanston wept and wept-o, his wonderful broom had been swept-o, first our Vex spied it, then she Shanghai'd it, because it turns out she's a total klepto. (all laugh) And then I will-- balls. I want to hold my thing to-- but I'm not going to. I'm going to hope this works and the dragon's coming at us. Maybe. I'm going to step forward as much as I can towards the sound I heard and blow my horn of fog just everywhere. Don't take it away from me, man! It's for tobacco, okay? (all laugh) All right. Good. But if something comes through, it will disturb the fog, correct? Oh, shit. (all laugh) Yeah, I'll just say, "I think she's over here, guys!" And that's it. Then I also lose my-- You are in a haunted house. You don't have anything against that. No, no, we made some good omelets. This is important work. I missed one episode. Rothfuss. OP. Oh shit. Oh boy. What just got dispelled? Well that's just math. Right behind me. That's disconcerting. Ah, okay. Sure, yeah, yeah, great-- Or legendaried it away. Seems like it. We're just in a nice line. Wow, good Indian accent. She's still invisible, though. She's still invisible, we can't see her. I was not holding my action. I thought about it. She's still restrained? Oh shit. What's all that? Yeah, that's what it is. Central. I was on the edge of one of them. Eight. I'm immune to meteors. (all laugh) Tell me this do I have-- how many hit points do I have, because when she dispelled the Hero's Feast, do I lose those temporary hit points? Okay. So... got it. No. When she dispelled things, did I also lose my Pike advantages things? Beacon of Hope? So you have to tell what you're dispelling? Okay. Okay. Yeah, until she saw something. Is that like a hand-grenade where you fall and-- What's he down-- I mean, how far down? It's not like past-- I know, that's what I'm asking. Is that true? You have advantage. This is the big one. It awoke, it awoke! 'Exalted', it says. Not just awoken. Exalted. It says anyone who wears the exalted Cabal's Ruin has permanently oiled skin. (all laugh) You should've used that shit. Did Pike lose hers? Ooh. Ooh. Did the dog get hit? Can I roll for the dog? Okay. Every time we use this dog that's what happens. I think we've only brought him out twice and he's been blown up both times. Oh man, that smarted. Um. Okay, is Kerrek around me? 100 feet. Well, I can't reach you anyway, so. Oh, can I see Allura from where I am? I'm going to heal Allura. It's 30. Well then, I'll walk that way as much as I can, actually. Yeah, right there. Sure. Yeah, that hits. Unless I Cutting Words it. Shit. I'll Cutting Words it. Sorry, Allura. Oh wait, no, that's not a bonus action-- --that's a reaction. So yes, I will Cutting Words. I will yell at the claw I see coming out of the cloud of smoke, I will say, "You're so dumb, you get your yearly checkup from Dr. Dranzel." (Weak laughter.) Two. That does not hit. Jesus Christ. Okay, so I will do a Healing Word on Allura. I will sing to her, (singing) "Scanlan singing in the dead of night, take your broken bones and learn to fly" That's all I got. Yes! Do I roll? Yes. d4, right? Four! That's ten! Double-dig. I will also boopadeeboopboop (raspberry sounds). Yeah. So I still have an action, right? And when I saw the form rise up in the cloud, it did not move away, it just rose up. So I have a vicinity. I saw a claw, I saw something like-- I can take a shot. Yeah, I'm going to take a shot. I am going to cast-- let's do Bigby's Hand at level six. Yeah. Sure. I mean, it's probably got to punch into the cloud a little bit to get-- Yeah. Yes, please. That was a cocked roll, but I'll take it, because I'm a man of honor, and it did not work. 13. Didn't actually roll. It hit the side of my box. Balls. All right. Okay, good. Is that bad? Yeah, the armor brings her back to one point, doesn't it? Is it five? (laughs) Oh, Jesus. She's not dead, she's walking around. Oh, when Bigby's Hand went at rest, it just started to just-- yeah. Was that a saving throw? Technically, disadvantage because of Cutting Words. Damn. Just the next saving throw. That's it. Well, that's not from words, that's from the sword. From my Mythcarver. Cone of Cold? Again. I die. Am I in there? 15. Shit. I am unconscious. (belches) Oh, I forgot we're on TV. (all laugh) Burped, yeah. I think he's auctioning something over there. In the Hindu faith, you would welcome it. Do I need to make a death saving throw? No. Okay. Don't move, just heal. What's the radius? Oh, thank god. I don't think that came out right. No, that's half of 34. Scanlan's lifeless corpse has a pool of urine around it. (all laugh) Is this my urine or someone else's? I don't know which is worse. Asparagus. That's me. Whoa! Does all that double because it was a crit? Did she blink into visibility? Oh balls. Great. It won't take very much since I've got the one hit point. But maybe my 14 AC will protect me. I mean, I'm unconscious now. I don't know. I can't remember when the last time I used a reaction was. Was it this round or the round before? All right. Okay, I'll say to Raishan this time, "You so dumb, when thieves stole your horse, you chased them down and said, "'You forgot the saddle!'" (all laugh) Six. Now just three more attacks to dodge and I'll be okay. Oh, that'll hit, sure. I'm the pink one. So wait, they can see my body sort of like moving? Three. This time I died with a bad joke and piss all over me. (All laughing.) Surrender. Vex. (coughs) Inspiration. What? Are you still alive? Wow. Her. Ritual of return? Okay. It's permanent, right? For 30 days. He was aiming at the eggs, though. I died again. Drink something. Guys, now that I don't have to play, I'm playing Marvel Puzzle Quest. (all laugh) I can't do anything. It was not your fault, Laura. It was Ashley's. It's going to be Shorthalt and de Rolo in heaven, just-- You're up, Laura. Roll good. Don't you have two of them? Right now, Scanlan's getting fed grapes by little cherubs that are the same size as him. (all laugh) Oh god! You want what? Oh. All right. Get used to it! (all laugh)
