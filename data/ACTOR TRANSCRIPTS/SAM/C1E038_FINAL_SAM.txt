I'm a dick. I'm always a dick. Wyrmwood Gaming? That's not mine. Ready? Pretend like you're a Dallas Cowboy and drop it. Is this yours? Is this yours? Oh, their troupe? The troupe name? Oh man, I wrote that three years ago. I have no idea. We'll look it up on the break. Magical Mystery Band. It was worth it. Well, we'll find out. Right. That's right. He's not dead. The bear we left at home. Next time. Next time. What? Where is Trinket? This is just like when David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear. Yep. David Copperfield? Feld? Travis can move, he's not going to help you. That's a good core body workout. Again? They know this man. They should know this man. Us? You may kill him. You are his blood? Sovereign, if I may, can we ask him a few questions before you do what you gonna do? He's talking crazy, we should find out why, right? He said, "I am born of his blood." What blood? I don't know what I'm asking. Where are these pieces located? No. Are you sure there's no more useful information we can get from this man? With his own taint. Wait, wait, wait, wait. We're not going to get any information out of him? Are there plans to attempt this at the next Winter's Crest that you know of? Oh, yeah. She didn't do it yet. Why not? We'll see what happens. All right. Good try, Pike. That was really good. I don't know if you should be smiling this much. You just killed a man. Have a little respect. Craven Edge and Grog! Sovereign? You know, I know we just talked earlier today and everything, but it feels like we should get some sort of reward or something for capturing this guy, doesn't it? I mean is that impolite to ask? It was the same day, wasn't it? Thank you. Probably when it gets delivered. It could be intercepted and stolen on the way. I suppose so. It's been a long day. We've taken damage today. We should go home. We were just in a tavern all day. Same tavern? Wait, hold on. (high-pitched cries) I'm Yelping it. (laughter) You don't know this town. Who knows this town the best? All right. Do you need me to yelp it again? All right, I will roll an investigation. All right. Let me talk to some people and see if I can find some things. Investigation? 18. Where's a good place to go? I'm looking for a speakeasy. Something off the beaten path. Or just a place that comes highly recommended. Let's get a round, shall we? You gave me a thousand gold. I'm feeling generous. I'll buy us a round. Should we go home? She's that girl. Don't worry. We have servants. Oh sure, sure. Grog? Gilmore! Wow, Gilmore, this is too much! Really. This is amazing. You're such a kind, generous soul. Not only that, we've, I don't know if word has reached you yet, but in Whitestone we're working towards establishing a Gilmore-themed library for the people with your name attached to it. Something respectable for a change! If you need any help, count on us. She's had one drink. I go and challenge Grog to a dart game. Well, it's been a fun night, guys, but I'm tired of letting Grog beat me at darts. They put the dart board so high on the wall! Well, one of those people was giving us the stink-eye. But we should go home. We should go home. Keyleth, please, don't be this way. We'll go out again tomorrow. It'll be fine. I'm super old. Let's go. I do hear that cures the hangover. She's going to-- She's going to take hit points. Vax! Vax! Hold her hair back! Hold her hair back. I'm not going near that shit. You too, Gil. You want some privacy? Peach schnapps. Let's go home. We've left our mark here. Oh, shit. Oh, it's my friends! This is why I wanted to come home! It's okay, ignore her. Let's go in. Lovely to see you. Did you bring those? Well, thank you. Doctor, thank you for coming over and bringing the gang. It's so great to see you again tonight. Is that the singer? Oh, please. Lay it on us. Anyone want to go to bed? All right. Laina, bring around some meats! Wait, we already ate. All right. Laina, go back to sleep. Is that lipstick on your face, Vax? Didn't we discuss this and assume that this is a house we'd been in once before? Do you know who used to reside there, Doctor? What about a position? So this is a new place? Hey. This is my friend. You know, Vex, we have sort of told the sovereign that we are interested keenly in the security of this area, and if this is an unsecured house, we could just be going in to try to secure it. Yes. God forbid a child wanders in there. Let's do this. Tomorrow, we'll set off to do this. In the meantime, we invite you to stay at our keep. Drink of our wine, eat of our food. Please, make yourselves at home. (chuckles) Yes. Thank you. We have a couple of rooms. Our dragonborn room is available now, and as well, we have a dungeon. I have a rather large bed, if Kaylie would like to take that. I could sleep on the floor. That's fine. Grog, carry some beds around. Is that Zed the drummer? Okay. Let's all turn in, shall we? I tell her all the best parts, and leave out the naughty bits. Kingslayer. Leader of the rebellion. Yes, please, I'm fascinated. Yes, yes he-- Well, I'm flattered, and, you have quite talent for-- quite a lot of talent for just been playing with the troop for six months. I was impressed by that. Who? I-- oh, I-- (laughter) She's going to fight me! First of all, Kaylie, it's so wonderful to meet you. I didn't know! Listen, I have my faults, for sure, but (stammers) I didn't know that you existed! I would have, I would have come to visit, I would have come to meet you-- how can you fault me for something that I did not know about? I mean, could you describe her a little more detailed? (laughter) Okay, wisdom? Which is a negative two. 16. Ah yes, Sybil. She was passionate, intelligent-- (laughter) I have been, in past moments in my life, a scoundrel, I've-- I mean... I feel like I wouldn't have let it go that far? I-- I don't want to fight you, if that's what you're insinuating. Listen, I know that I've made mistakes in my life. I've admitted as much before, and I don't know why I'm this way. I must need to do a lot of soul-searching to come up with an answer, but there is a woman who I love very dearly and who I would do anything for, and I'm trying to be a better person. I haven't been to a whorehouse in months! That's a big step for me. A bit step. I know that sounds callous and crude, but I've tried to be a better person. If you're here to fight me, I'm afraid you're going to be terribly disappointed, because I will just let you kill me, if that's what it takes. I didn't know you existed, and my heart is breaking a hundred times now for not knowing it. Every year that you've been alive is a year I could have been a better person and known someone who could have made me a better person, and I'm only sorry that I didn't know it. If there's anything I can do for you from now on-- if you are truly my blood, I will, because among my many faults, ego is certainly one of them, and knowing you're part of me makes me love you even more. (laughter) Persuasion? It won't matter. 32. Oh, shit. She's big. I slowly unbutton my shirt and show her my chest and say, "Stab me right here, if you'd like, "and I will not resist. You've earned it. Take me." A natural one? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry that you're going through this, and I'm more sorry that you're going through this by yourself, but I think deep down you're a Shorthalt, and there's something that you have that's connected to me and I to you, and perhaps I misread that as some sort of-- ugh-- icky attraction, and I apologize, but I've known for a while now that something is missing in my life, some sort of focus, and some sort of moral compass. Maybe it's just arrived at my doorstep? I sit for a moment and think about everything, try to remember more about Sybil. Yes. She was, she was. Yes, I think, yeah. She wasn't that giant. No, she was. Okay. And I have a very restless night thinking about everything. With my daughter! That's my daughter you're talking about, by the way. Mm. Is Dr. Dranzel around? Old friend, a quick word. Good morning-- Well, morning to you as well. Did you know? Did you know? About the girl? All right. Does he seem-- Can I insight check him? Does he seem genuine? Oh, boy. (laughter) No, no. She's a fine player and a fine, upstanding person, and you should take special interest in her. She's a good one. Please, if she continues on with your troupe, take good care of her, all right? She might. All right. Where's our five-thou? Natibe? I wrote them down, it's not a big deal. (laughing) Shit. Dra. Well, you know. They're cool. Ugh. Let's just say I struck out, all right? Yeah, it's fine. No! No, no, no! She doesn't like our kind, she's-- She's off-limits. I saw her first. Yes, you could say so. I think maybe. I don't know. She ran off last night. But we should find her. You could say that. Your breath is disgusting. (laughter) That's fine. Ask Pike. Yes, we're going to go do that today. It's a bad guy's house, so it'll be fine. We'll explain on the way. We don't know. We don't know what's in the house. It's a mysterious thing to be happening in this town. We're going to check it out. We won't do anything untoward. Yes, please do. And keep a good eye out for her. And if you have a gig tonight-- Do you have a gig tonight anywhere? All right. You can use our place as a base of operations, but please try not to steal anything else. Well, you would dream of it. You'd absolutely dream of it. Just don't do it. All right. Let's go check out this house. You want to stay and take a look after these people? Well, no need to be coy, stinky. We're not stealing, we're investigating. She is the worst drunk. I'm coming. We're taking the bear or leaving the bear? All right, let's go. (laughter) What guards? We're above them in rank. Well, it's owned by someone, isn't it? Someone deserted it. Yes, it's private property. You're being very prudent. We're better at this than them. Let's go do what we do. Right, Trinket? How can you resist that? Hop check. Do you bring around one of those like-- Yeah, rolling wardrobe racks Grog just knocked. I'm going to inspire her. With a limerick. All right, I'm going to inspire her. There once was a gnome with a mace. Who had an adorable face. She never would bed me, but I hope she won't forget me. 'Cause oh how I do love the chase. That helps. See, this is our problem. We've been approaching doors without Pike! We need Pike! Oh, that's good! Free food, Grog. Oh, so it's the food. Split the party. Okay. So wait, we're checking all the rooms that are probably okay? I'll go upstairs with Percy. Poison, charm-- what was it? Dexterity, huh? 12. Well. Oh shit, it's closing on me, isn't it? Natural 20. Oh! You've got that! Did you guys see that? I was like in an aquarium. More of a globe, but yeah, no, that works. (laughter) (singing) Step one. Let's go. Thank you Keyleth, I take it back about your breath. Everyone who's going upstairs? 28. So we go down. Let's all go. Let's go. Who's going first? Pike? Then Vax's wardrobe rack, then me. 22. Jarett's a mole, kill him. That's straight-up Goonies. This place has been pilfered before and no one took that. Everyone dies. Pike, do you want to look at it further? Oh, it's Vecna? I'm just going to peek behind the tapestry. Okay. Nothing there. I lick the wall. I forgot about that. Where'd my face go?! Like make it a parachute? Do we step onto it? How does it work? Survival? Trouble is our middles names. There was a dragon, there was some loot. Did we crack one of them? Maybe they've reformed. I can make a fake person to push something or lift something, but he won't be able to-- Get rid of those rocks? Everybody? 20. Does it look like he might be my son? (laughter) I suspect everyone now. A fountain of gold? It's a Scrooge Dragon. Wait. Why are we here? Why have we come here? Are we just getting as much money as we can and leave, or are we trying to kill something, or are we trying to seal this place off? Why are we here? So is our mission to take money and leave? But we can still hear you, so keep talking. We might have to unfreeze him first. If you're going, I'm going with you to protect you because god knows Trinket won't. I'm with Vex and Trink. Wait, that's not us. Faster, faster! I think because we touched this gold-- Pike! Ask the dead guy who it is. What the fuck is a purple worm? Hey, chat room, buy her a ticket home. (singing) Danger lurks behind you.
