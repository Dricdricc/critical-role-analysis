Oh really? It's the Asp Hole. It's just a bar that I like to go to. Down at the Asp Hole. Yeah, we'll find the Asp Hole. So we're standing outside the place where we just left Pike? While he's doing that, Scanlan is feeling still terribly sad about leaving Pike. So overcome with emotion that he must step into the ruins one last time, just to see the place where she's going to be for the next several months, years. And before I do so, I drink one of my potions that I bought from what's-his-butt. Gilmore, the glorious Gilmore. Yes. I don't know how it works, but I'm going to drink it anyway. Okay, I drink it. I go inside the ruins and look around and touch some of the walls and look at the stonework and everything. I want to see where she's going to be so I know she's safe. Overcome with a little bit of verklempt emotion, I shed a single tear. I feel uncomfortable. It must be the emotion. I find a side chamber or a little nook. Somewhere where I can have some privacy. I say a little prayer, and I take a big dump on the floor. Well, my stomach was rumbling. Sometimes it just affects me. I have weak nerves. And as I'm squatting, I hum to myself. (singing) How do I say goodbye to what we almost had? I left a magic dump. Nope. We should leave the dump. It's already magical poo. So I leave and rejoin my fellows, wiping the tear from my eye and the poo from my bottom. I took a potion that will let me see through my poo and check in on Pike from time to time. I certainly hope not. As long as some of my cellular remains are there, I might be able to see a little bit into the room. (laughs) It's poo. I feel great right now, by the way. It's magic poo! He's a god of some sort? To who? These are dwarves? They're not dwarves. Bellows' Respite. Kord's strength to you. Who are the options? I'm more of his manager than his friend, actually. Hi, I'm Scanlan. Pleasure's all mine. My brute over here, who can he battle, what are his options? Excuse me? It would be that. She bets for all of us. You mean Grog? Who is he fighting? We have to bet before we see the meat? Don't tell him. Those are fair odds, we'll take that. I'll bet 50 gold against him. We have to hedge! Well then, I can't afford it. I'm sorry. We have to hedge. What? It's an expression. Will that show? Yeah, you should have a fancy fighting name. Oh, he's already down? Wait, I come over to Grog and I just look in his eyes and I say, listen, you've got this, I can't give you anything else, but you've got this, man. And I also very quickly take out my Potion of Fire Giant Strength and I slip it to him before he takes a drink of his ale. I don't know if I hand it to him. Okay. (squeaks) Nope. Oh, that's a six. So eight. It's for my asthma. I promise. Come on, Phillip! Kick his ass! Wait, that's your whole move? Don't do it. You got this, Phillip. Phillip, do that thing where you move your pecs up and down! (laughter) Half that? Do it. Your head is so puny. Are you still raging? (whispers) Should we do something? I feel like we should do something. Should I sing? From the stands, I turn to a portly gentleman next to me and I say, sir, do you see what that fucking little elf said about your mother? He called her a name I can't even repeat. I'm so sorry. Yes. 18. Baby! Wait, doesn't he have no nose? You know what I love about these fights? They're beautiful. The beauty of the human body. No, he rolled three already. Come on, roll good. It's like a dance! It's like a beautiful dance. Miss. I go down and nurse him, nurse his head, hold him, and just tell him, Grog, you won! You did it, buddy! 16. The Bellows' Respite. Do we have a room? I don't think he's going to want to... partake tonight. Aw, he's chugging. He's sadness-chugging. Three. Plus a stable for our bear. No, it's okay, he needs to stew in this for a while. I don't think he wants company tonight. I almost won. There's a lot of injured pride tonight. Hey, does anyone want to come to my room and look through my shit to see how Pike's doing? That's not even chicken, that's just a piece of wood. (laughter) Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon. Remind me, what was on our plate? What's on our plate? It's more of a poo walkie-talkie. Just know that there's poo involved. You see through it. Well, multiple things. There's just go back to Kraghammer and get money, or go where Keyleth wants to go. What's family for other to take advantage of? Oh, is that Dwarvish? Is that true? There's no bridge here. Yeah, let's go adventuring. I turn to the barkeep and say, well, what was that? Do you know? Have you heard that before? What is that? Attack? Where? How do we know where? I'm ambling behind them. Should we go kill it? Of course we can track it. Go kill it? I thought we'd decided to go to Keyleth's. Help the city out by going to track the hydra first? Only if there's money involved. From who? (laughter) Hey, Grog. Grog, come in. We're going to go kill something. We need you. Let's leave Trinket behind. Just for now, it's so hard to keep track of Trinket, Jesus. What, me? Do I know Polymorph? Oh, to fly. I guess we're going. Hold on! Sorry, there was just a little magic so we could go kill the hydra, sorry... (laughter) Wait no, we saw the direction it went in, right? I'm coming along. Survival check? Is that for her? Good ranging. No, let's just go down the middle. What, did it leave traps? It's a hydra. Let's continue on as fast as possible. I'm going to inspire her with a little song of inspiration. (singing) And the ranger's going to range, range, range, range, range. And the tracker's going to track, track, track, track, track. I'm just going to watch, watch, watch, watch, watch. Watch her range. Oh good. Three points. Is the foliage around us green? Brown? Standard foliage color? I'm going to turn us all deep green. With Seeming. Seeming. Yes with Seeming. I spread my Seeming all over us, turning us green. With Seeming all over us. We're rolling for stealth? With advantage? 16. 16. So we're all good. Should we try to push him in the water? Let's do this. I'm going to move closer. In your eye! God, you're having the worst day! Yeah, that's going to come in handy when he just kills all of us in one shot. Chain Lightning? You have Chain Lightning? I know, I used it at the fight that you didn't want to fight in. 28. No, that's 28. I'll move and do Lightning. Why not? Just try to get as much as possible. Just so I won't hit whoever that is. Yes, I do. 19. 19. That was 6d6. Ten more! Oh, hey. I got a head! 16. First good roll I've ever had. Out of the wound. It had five when we started! 14. I did. I'm going to punch it with Bigby's Hand. I'm going to do Bigby's Hand. And punch it. That's it. Punch. That's my move. Punch. (singing) It's Bigby's Hand! Bigby's Hand. You know it. Shamone. Add my spell attack? This? Spell attack. 21. 23. Hey guys, I got rid of another head! Hey guys, I'm on a roll! Who still hasn't gone? Keyleth, you haven't gone? Okay, I'm going to inspire Grog with my bonus action. Oh, I'm going to inspire him. (singing) Come on Grog, yeah, you know what I mean. It's time to rage on this hydra... Blurs in the bushes! Hold Person. Hold Percy. On the hydra? Ooh. While you were gone, everything happened, by the way. Everything happened. Hey guys! There's more heads for me to knock off! We get to keep doing it! From a meteorite? Wait, from a meteorite?! Geometry, kids. You're trying to beat 17. Yeah, you've got inspiration, friend. Nine? No, remember? I said leave Trinket behind? Yeah, we just set off a nuke on the thing. I get closer and do the Superbowl shuffle in front of our new visitors, like, yeah, that's what we did. Oh, by not killing the hydra? Because that's what you just did. What's your name, sir? We didn't think this through. Listen. Let's level with you. This whole escapade was not very well thought out. We're new in town. We don't want to step on any toes. We did you a solid; we killed your thing. Let's calm it down a notch and let's just talk, shall we? What funds are we talking about, here? What was the contract that you had been binded by? Aldor is no longer talking, right? That's your leader? Don't ever do that again. We were subcontracted to you, yes. Introduce yourselves, if you don't mind. Oh, what will you do to us? What you did to the hydra? Oh no! Not kill us. Few people do. It's all right. We'll get it and we'll figure it out when we get there. Yeah, let's deal with the naughty bits later. What is with skags? Just call us people, please? All right. Yeah, he's a peach. Good find. Well, as long as it's affectionate. We didn't know we were interfering with it at the time. We thought we were just doing good, and we're here to make right by that. We're quite capable fighters. Grog here almost won in his fight the other night. Sorry, Grog. Show her the lip. Greyskull. What is involved in signing or binding this contract? Oh, it's a trial just to bind the contract? There's an insignia that we get? Is it given to us on some sort of jacket for members only? (laughter) My body's a temple. I don't like that. The judgment? Oh no, no. Do I have to get branded? (whimpers) I'm really wimpy. Could you do mine in henna? (laughter) Thank you. Yes. I'm with my group. Do we get to pick the teams? Vanessa? I am not going to spell that right. Mertin Cyndrial... Well, this should be interesting. We'll set off on our journey right away, then. After we complete the task. Have a good three days. All right, Grog. Let's go.
