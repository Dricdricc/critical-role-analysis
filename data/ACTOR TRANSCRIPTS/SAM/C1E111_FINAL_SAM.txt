And the full name of the game is Middle Earth Shadow of War, for all of those who are looking for it alphabetically. Yes, and many of us were in the game yelling our asses off. I played a little character known as Orc 4. It was so much! I did 20 recording sessions. Oh, nice. You were in it, right? No? Oh, what did you do in the first one? Laura, were you in it? Do you have a number after your character? We're supposed to mention that on the 18th of this month, Shadow of War will be debuting a brand new live-action trailer that will take you near the game? No! Right into the game. Soon we'll need to choose whether to save or slay. During the break tonight, they're going to be showing off some awesome videos from the game. It drops October 10th. Go buy it and try to pick out our voices in the game as you slay us. Are we selling those in the store? Is it good? I haven't read it. Why have you all read it and I haven't? Yeah, that's fair. That's true. I really should check my email! Everybody tweet Laura tomorrow at noon, saying-- How do you play Dungeons and Dragons? I've forgotten entirely what we're supposed to do now. Insight check! I got nothing. Did we get any items recently? Yeah, what does it do? We all have potions, right? Did we pass out potions? This is just for us to remember what we're doing. I don't know. Should we stop? I think we're on a timetable. We should keep moving, right? Does anyone need to heal? Yeah, you were trying to read Dwarvish, or something. And it took an hour. It just said, "Do not enter." The sword of Kas? She's turning more and more Canadian as you go. How tall? Oh god. Matt, my friends just told me to start paying attention to the cadence of the steps to see if they change in any discernible way. 15. He's big. I think it's just a vanity. Pressure knobs? Human bones. Only ones and 20s tonight. And say goodbye. Is Vax in the room? The brazier's the source of the furnace, I assume. Wait, before we do that, I'm going to enter the room and look around at the walls and the ceiling. I'm looking for markings, indications of instructions, arrows, any hidden words-- Ooh, a lot. 29. Wait, so the wall that we came in through? I think there's magical buttons in here and we need to find them? So I'm going to look in the mirror. I go to the opposite corner and do the same thing. Even in the mirror? They were upper and lower corner, yeah. It's so far. I don't know. Can I see it? Oh yeah. 14 plus six, that's 20. Keyleth, do that same thing to the lower one. Same marking? Same symbol? Let's do that to the other walls and see if we can find other ones. So we push those? But there's a hidden button in there. So we're going to need four people. Not the buttons that we can see. What are these symbols here? I think they're buttons, as well. Was there anything there? What do they do? What do these lines do? Wait, you guys are blowing on the arcane symbols? And that's two lines. Boom. Blow! Laura, blow! Wait, so we've got one, two, two, four? Except we have two twos, and no three? And then why not three? Okay, all right. Can we do a sweep for more? Possibly. Not too long. I'll look in my memory. One hour, but I have to be close to it. How big is this room? From the doorway to the mirror, is it less than 60 feet? Oh, then I can be out of the door. Am I right with what I wrote down there? Yeah, from the brazier-- Frasier Crane. Looking at the door that we came in. Right? I think, Matt, you're wrong. Guys, Shadow of War! It's a great game by-- I don't know, who makes it? Warner Brothers! Yes, so now we've just got to do it. All right, should we leave the room and have Mr. Invisible start tapping buttons? All right, we'll do that. Would a person who cannot fly be able to touch the top buttons? Shit. Want to give him a pole or something? Do we have a stick in the bag? Matt, can he hold a lance, or is that violating some-- he's not allowed to hold weapons. I conjure an unseen servant, whom I will name Simon Two. All right, Simon Two, take this lance. We're going to go tell you what buttons to press over there, good speed-- good speed? (laughter) Okay, so two upper right. Two pokes. Oh, wait. Yes, we're going to go mirror image of this, so project that across the room. Oh, that was the mistake. Yes, mirror image of this, so upper left. Let's try that. Any door? So below it, two presses. Just like your name, Simon two. Okay, opposite corner, up. One press. And then below that, bottom corner. Four presses. Simon Two is coming with us. We can see it, Grog. Any roll? Want to fly through here? Can we fly? I know, that's why we just fly through. What are you talking about? Why would Vecna keep the thing that could kill Vecna near Vecna? All right, let's swoop in and swoop out. You want to go to sleep in this undead city?! So sacrificing Vasselheim so that we can feel better about a fight? Well, let's stay on the path and see how long it takes. Is that purple eyeliner? They need somebody who can help them in there. I feel like one person with magic should go with them. I'll go with them. No, it's Keyleth, Vex, and Pike are going searching. The boys are going in the temple, and the girls are going searching. I'm going, too. Oh wait, shit. Your fucking ring. All right, into the temple. Come on, let's just fucking go to the fucking temple. Oh, we're all rolling stealth? 25. He's so excited about that temple. So a rock just fell? And is in pieces? No, we're trying to go towards the temple. Oh, the filter? The censer? Are the undead all around the temple? Are there any bone laying around? I am going to pick up two bones, give them to Simon Two, and tell him to go across the street, 50 feet away from us, and wait there in some building. Hold these bones. Smash and grab. You could go in there and get that thing, be out before they even saw you in there. He's 50 feet away, right now, and he's waiting to make noise. He could. He could go and pick it up and come right back with it. If he picks up the crystal and it doesn't work, or it doesn't move? We need an escape plan, right? How many can fit on the carpet? We don't need to discuss this now. We need to get the crystal and get the fuck out of here! Yeah, of course. No, he can't. He's done with his wings. We have too many people for the carpet and the broom. We can leave Trinket. I can burn a spell and be a giant eagle or something. We could just run. Up away. Every organ in a body has an entrance and an exit, right? Wait, no, lungs don't; they just have the one. I can recall Simon 2. I can send him across the room, make a bunch of noise, draw a bunch of people over there. You run, grab the crystal, and then we hustle out of there. And there's going to be a floating crystal that marches across? Simon 2 is going to go get the thing. Let's say they all start watching the thing come towards us. Grog, are you here? Are you with us? Can you throw something across the room to make a noise? This is a terrible plan. Guys, I'm just going to say this one more time before we do this he's way faster than Simon 2. Simon 2 could create a distraction. He could (snatching noise). All right, Simon 2. Come back with your bones! All right. Simon 2, go to the middle of the room. Throw the bones away, far, then grab the crystal. You don't have pockets. Run back to us! Away, yeah. Should he cover it with a blanket or something? Do you have a hood? So it blocks the light? All right, so go put this handkerchief on the thing, pick it up, and bring it back to us. Go, Simon 2. You're our only hope. He's holding a blanket. TALIESIN and Give me the bones. I put the bones down. Here's a handkerchief. You'll put it over the crystal, pick up the crystal, and bring it back to us. Right before he picks it up, hock a rock as far as you can. That's a good guy, that Simon 2. They were innocent. 77?! You've served us well. What about a tunnel or anything? I didn't do one. I'm weeping over Simon 2. Let's go. Sure. I can look at it. I remove the handkerchief. I look at it. I inspect it like a jeweler inspecting a jewel. 18 arcana check. What about Pikey-pants? Can she detect if it's evil or good or something? Does she do that? You said no sense of evil? No. No, who? Who is it? Oh, the fancy fellow? He's probably dead somewhere. Don't you think that about everyone and everything? Is "El Vecna" Spanish for Vecna? Why don't we hang onto it for now? In a moment of peril, we can throw it or smash it. Its heart? Soul glow? All right, focus! Two? Me. I give it to Grog. All right, then I'll keep one. Let's keep going up the stairs. Remnants? Travis, shut up! These two and their gigantic damage rolls. Huge, bulbous. The dice smell a little bit. Oh shit. You need help, Matt? We've also heard the name Odell. There's been three Jamieson's in our campaign, too. Matt isn't an infinite fount of names. 18. (singing) Your wicked lies. I'm up? What can I do? My speed is 25. Oh god, this looks like a crazy thing. Wow. There's a Wall of Force. Do I see a Wall of Force? Okay. I see Grog in attack mode, right? I see these two bad guys. I will send a Lightning Bolt at somebody. Looks like I can't see this guy because there is a pillar in between, so the other guy. Is someone controlling it? I see this happening, right? We can get dudes behind you to hold you up. Is it a thing? Is it a weapon? It's a 20? (screaming) Even if we move out of the radius? I'm going to take a few steps forward. I will inspire Grog, I guess. I'm okay. I'll sing to him. (singing) Don't mess with that big black ball, it can really fuck you up. I really hate that big black ball, all it better do is miss you, make it miss you. And I guess I'll Dimension Door, try to go through the Wall of Force. We've tried this before, Matt. Who knows how this shit works? Yeah, but that could have been a gentle nod. Matt fucking hates this. I don't know where the runner went. I don't see him, right? Can I gauge roughly how far he went down that hall? Do I see down the hall? So I'm going next to the red guy. That's my everything. Who are you calling little? That's not good for me, guys. Hey, you broke through! Make Matt stand up, Laura. A lot. 167. Power Word? Hold on. I need to look up the range of a fucking spell. How far is he from me? I'm looking. That one's not. You said how far? Oh shit. Yeah, I'm going to move 25 feet towards him. And with my darkvision, do I get a sense for how far he is from me now? Fuck no, it's not. Shit, I need 30. No. That's my movement. I have tiny little nubs. Yeah. That's okay. Yeah, I've got longer-range shit, but it's not as bad news. I'm thinking. I'm trying to decide between two things. It's going to have a lot of wisdom. All right. I will Bigby's Hand. I assume he's got a lot of wisdom, so I will Bigby's Hand him. At level seven. And I will punch the shit out of him. I didn't. I forgot. I rolled an 18. And I've got one. Wait. Shit. What did I just roll? 16 plus four. That's 20. And then this is another-- 40. 40 points of force damage. Yeah. I don't know. Right? As a bonus action, can I do anything? No, but can I throw something to see if it goes through the wall? Sure. 17, plus I don't know. Scanlan found these two really crappy daggers in the desk in the casino. Yeah, I'm done. You said Fireball on this guy? Bigby's Hand takes damage. Yeah, he has hit points. He could! 11. It's fine. Bigby's Hand has 167 hit points. Yeah, it's me. One misses? I'm going to use Bigby's Hand to grab the sphere. That's not so bad. I'm going to go over to the sphere and say to it I command thee to respect my authority and obey me as your new master. I'm intimidating the sphere. Intelligence arcana check? Oh! 19. Yeah, I came closer to it. That's not good. 11. Bigby, save me! Don't look at me! I'm fine. I think I can take this thing. I just need to try again harder. This is an ability check, right? I'll try one more time. I'm going to inspire myself. Pretty good. And inspire? Okay. Plus my what? Arcana?! Ooh, that's a lot. 30. (garbled) Listen to me, damn it! Respect my authority! Plus three. I'm trying to will it to-- Shit, it's just a big black ball. Slam straight into the ceiling! We can use it! Have you guys seen The Explorers? You are?! That's one of my favorite movies of all time! Can I get your autograph? Oh, wow! It only listens to me. No, this is a cool thing. Guys, I think we can make it. No, we can't! We'll never make it! Yes, we can! We're still investigating these guys and stuff. I'm going to call this ball Simon 3. It will slow us down. Double mumbo-jumbo? How close are we? What's his plan? Where is he? Who's with him? Who seemed more senior? There was the guy they killed right when they burst on the scene. Laughter? Sphere! Do your worst. First of all, it's so great to be back! Matt, thank god you're totally 100 percent healed and all better again.
