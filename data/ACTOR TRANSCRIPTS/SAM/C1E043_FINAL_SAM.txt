I do? That is impossible. Hi guys, welcome to Critical Role, where we nerdy-ass voice actors like to roll dice and play Dungeons & Dragons. Oh, and Liam just threw some curses at me right before we started. (laughter) Oh, sorry. We don't know what's coming, do we? No. That's a fantastic idea. Percy. Can I just remind you, for no other reasons than to be helpful to you in the game and no other reason, that the black powder salesman lives here. Just throwing it out there, you might need some supplies. You're right. How silly of me. Kima is a great idea. Oh, yes. Hell yes. I don't have anything. Yeah, but they sell those here? Who? Oh, the wife? She's very powerful. She's related to Percy? I don't see the resemblance. Where do I go? You said your name was Ka-SHAW? Scanlan Shorthalt. It's nice to meet you. I've heard many a tale of your wit and bravery. I told her, I told her. Oh, sorry. I am. 21. It's a shapeshifter? What can you do with the head? That's true. What, who? Osysa? They have more than we do. About these Vestiges, perhaps? I don't kill very much at all. Yeah, I mean, she gave us a lot to "sphinx" about. (groaning) No? No? Wait, did Osysa just tell us she could possibly send us to her partner? Oh, we have to make our way. That's a big "what if?" A lot to do. Maybe we should split up into eight groups. Yes, you're right, yes. Quadroads, of course. None. "... leave." (laughter) All right, to the potion shop. To the Quadroads. I attempt to read lips. The place where we got a lot of stuff. Ooh, nice. So coincidental. That's exactly what Grog offered. Vex, no. You can't, you can't possibly trade that. It's too valuable. What are you doing? Those are the Knickknacks of Kaa. I can't. Please sir, please don't take advantage of us by taking these things from us. They're too valuable, please, I beg of you. The Knickknacks of Kaa. Am I assisting? Oh wait, I don't get to roll? I don't get to roll anything? (sighs) Oh, that's good. Why did you even-- Any one of these could fail. The Pocket Fisherman! Negative one intimidation. Oh, Jesus. That seems fair. Kash, Zahra, you should probably contribute. Vex. He said two superior. I'm coming too. (laughter) That lady was the worst. (laughter) To a pub? The world. Can I divvy those out, please? Who gets the supe? And the great? (clears throat) Yes! While they're buying powder, I'm going to go get a fucking drink somewhere. The Abundant Terrace area. Dagon is the owner. Oh. Grog, would you rather go to the one near the Braving Grounds? Or this one? Yeah, whatever's closer. Let's go. Oh, shit! Oh, Percy, well. Fuck the dragons! (laughter) (sighs) What is it, like, noon right now? (laughter) Should we find Kima next, or should we spend the day here? I'm not drunk. (mutters) Pretty eyes. Did you kill him, Grog? That's my boy. All right. Swung your axe. (laughs) He's a complicated man. He goes to dark places. This is amazing. Sorry about this, Kash. When our party gets-- I just met you, and I don't know much about you, but are you more of a Vax man or a Vex man? Like, how do you roll? How do you--? Would you be interested in the rogue or the ranger? Okay. High five it. Are we going to Kima now, or are we going to go see Grog fight? Sure, sure. All right, we can do that another day, maybe? Or do you want to--? Maybe we should-- they can wait outside or something. Hello there. Excuse us. We are of the Slayer's Take-- Is that a good thing? We are of the Slayer's Take and we ask for entry into your Platinum Temple. Thank you. How do we address him? All right. We'll make it that, though. Her stuff? How much do you know about the dragon attacks that have been raging across the world? Will we know the presence of this champion or will it be a silent one? I think we want her to do her stupidest. Udire, it would have been a swell adventure with you, maybe next time. Sir, thank you for granting us this aid that we will definitely need in our journey. We also are new to this dragon-slaying business and would love your advice and any information you might have, especially about some specific items. Something called the Vestiges of Divergence? Or how many there were? Highbearer. These dragons who are running rampant across the world, them being chromatic dragons, do you think they have pledged their loyalty to the Queen? Well, thank you for all your help. One more question before we leave you to your-- On our journey, we may have to travel long distances quite often. Is there any means of quick travel to other parts of the continent from Vasselheim? Airships, teleportation circles, any means that you know. How's that Horn of Orcus going, by the way? Oh, sorry. Sorry. No, don't do that. Big scary dragons. It's been destroyed. Only trees she's seen and knows very well. Followed by the airship. That is so cool. Let's do this. Paleo. What shall be a test? Does he mean us, or? She's not here. We give him his strength, sir. (laughing nervously) Not my kind of fight! Oh, I got a ten. Are we talking still? Is it just us against one person? No, I can see on the screen. 16. Hi! (laughter) What's going on? That hits. All I've heard was "Scanlan.'" (laughter) Did Grog moving activate Vax? Didn't you hold your turn or something? I'll stand up out of the sand. And I will, eeeee, I will-- (laughter) I will attempt to cast, with the horn, Eyebite on him, and I'll sing, (singing) My my my, eye bitten twice shy. (laughter) It's a wisdom save. It's 19. This is a good question. I don't know what to do. Should I make him fall asleep? I think no. Because we want this fight to continue, that would sort of end it, won't it? Yeah, I want him to go to sleep in the sand. Just curl up in the fetal position. That was a quick fight. I mean, he can't swipe at me if I walk away, so I'm gonna get away from him. Although he can move super fast. I'll walk a little bit away. And I'll inspire Grog, in case this fight continues, and I will sing-- I will sing (singing) Hail to the goliaths, hail victory, blood on the warpath, fight for Vax and me. (laughter) (whispers) That's the Redskins' fight song. (yelling) What do we do? He will, but you get, you'll get a few licks in. Yeah, kill him. No, he's asleep. I assume this is a sneak attack since he can't see it. He will wake up after this. I don't know, actually. Can I change the effect, or does it always have to be-- It's true. He's still eyebitten. All right. Instead of sleeping this time, I would like him to just get sick. Be sick. I want him to be sick now. Oh, he has like diarrhea. You didn't sleep well, did you? No? And I will turn to Vax this time and inspire him, and I will say, (singing) Kill that monk-y douchebag, white boy. Kill that monk-y douchebag right. Take out your daggers and kill that monk-y douchebag 'til he dies. (laughter) I'll move a little further away, it won't really help. Oh shit. I was trying to get away from him! Just take your 80 points of damage, not your 160 points. Don't hide behind me! You've got inspiration still. No effect! 10d10! You could be inspired, god damn it! All you have to do is pledge allegiance to the Washington football team. (laughter) Still sick. Oh, so he's done. All right. Well. I'm far away from him, but Grog's right next to him, so I probably shouldn't do anything too terrible. I'll join in the bludgeon-fest, and I will cast (sings) Bigby's Hand! And I will, I'll make it come right next to him, sort of between him and Grog? I can't get between him and Grog. Okay. To the side, to the side would be good. And just punch! Just a couple punches. Just throwing some punches. Melee spell attack. What do I add? Spell attack bonus-- Okay. 27. That was a natural 20. But the disadvantage, so the 27. Yes. Oh wait, now I roll for damage. With Bigby's Hand. I rarely do this. 4d8. I'll just roll this one four times, it's fine. 17? 4d8, right? Decent, decent. And I will inspire Grog again, with a little ditty, I will say, (singing) You're a psycho killer, with a bearded face, Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog. Run r-- That's fine. I'm a little boy! Yeah. Okay, I'll use Cutting Words on the last one. But I'm using Cutting Words on the third one to try to-- No, I said the third one. On the one that was a 20. Okay. Six. 17. I sing, (singing) No no no no, don't phunk with my heart! (laughter) Dex, dex, dex. 16. Oh, plus four? Really? Okay. Oh, yeah. Saw that for some reason there's a plus four there. 20. Oh, hi. I'm between two strong men. I'm lucky Pierre. Oh, yes. Oh yes. That's 11 plus two is 13, right? Not great, not great. And 14. 13 and 14. (gasps) Bigby's Hand is gone. That doesn't hit. That doesn't hit. (laughter) Ah, that's not bad. I'll be fine. Oh, shit, I get to do more shit? I'm fine. Fine. Monk's got nothing on me. So he's right next to me, he's right next to all of us. Okay. Well, I will-- he's right next to me? And no one's behind him. So I will just Lightning Bolt him. From right there. Can I do that? Oh, I've got something in my pocket, (yells). (laughter) Is this my spell DC? So 19. Yeah, yeah. He's fast as lightning. Damn it. I mean, that's all I can do. You know what, I'll use my bonus action to heal myself a bit. I'll use Healing Word on myself at third level. So that's two, 3d4 plus five, right? Ten, ten plus five. Ten plus five. Okay, 15. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, I'll take that. As I fly through the air, I'm looking up to see if Kashaw's putting any moves on Keyleth or anything. That's my armor class, 17. Can I use my Cutting Words on that one? It's once per turn. Oh, that's considered a bardic inspiration, my Cutting Words? It says, bardic inspiration, no that's not it, is it? 1d10, is that, five? Okay, I'm using it. It's a d10, yeah? Hey, I rolled a six. Don't hit me, I'm a little boy! (laughter) Not bad. (strained) So will I. (laughter) I bow as well. Oh fuck! I look over at Zahra.
