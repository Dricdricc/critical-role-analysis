Hi, everyone. It's me, Sam Riegel. Tonight, we're pleased to be sponsored by Magic the Gathering - Puzzle Quest, which you can find at bit.ly/magicrole. Guys, the hour of devastation is at hand in Magic the Gathering - Puzzle Quest. Check out new card abilities like Eternalize and the latest Planeswalker to arrive Elspeth, the Sun's champion! Not second or third place; the Sun's champion! Jump into daily live events where you can compete alongside your coalition for top placement or head over-- I don't know any of these words. (laughter) Black Lotus. That is Magic the Gathering. Reverse cowgirl. She Wolf. No, that's-- Lone Wolf. Illicit Auction. You're correct! The Angry Pirate. That's a Kama Sutra. Correct, Liam O'Brien. Maybe two more. Two more. The Curled Angel. Correct! The Mud Hole. Correct! (cheering) It's both. (laughter) Nice and vague. If one of us dies tonight, do we not go to GenCon? Where's the cake? But where's the cake? Well, your voice is super sexy tonight, so that's good. Are we going to this volcano under the water? We need to be able to swim. We should save at least one for a certain fight. It's so convenient! I had some. (laughter) Said Kathleen Turner. We're probably not going to fight anything, though. An interpretive dance! (laughter) Pike, will you do me a favor, and will you get word to Kaylie somehow? Tell her Dad's okay and saving the world again. I should have asked that long ago! Well, don't say, "Dad's okay, saving the world again." That won't make any sense to him. Especially Scanlan. He's probably really concerned. What is this, a restaurant? How are we traveling? And where are we going? We're diving down into the volcano, forging some trammels. One question. I have the infinite blessings of Ioun's knowledge. I am a holy man. However, I'm not exactly clear. Do we need those little peas to make these trammels? And we have three of them. We're not going to get more of these before we forge the trams? We should really tip 10%. You know, be really generous. How do we get there? Okay. Let's do it. Put it on Vax. Oh god, just kiss already! Oh god! They do. Boulder always wins. Mr. and Mrs. de Rolo. To mask you from scrying? I've heard of such things, but I don't currently have one. What's your name, young lady? Fenna. Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Oh. I'm being racisted against? Touché, Fenna. Touché. I'm not going into the necklace. Are you standing up for me? It's really easy. I don't mind putting on the hat. No, let's stand on principle. Can any of us sail? Will that be possible? I feel like we've rented a ship before. Maybe it's a shitty ship. Would you take this as a deposit? I give her this platinum bracelet with a sapphire that I have. We'll get it back when we return the ship. Oh, wait. But wait, it just occurred to me as I was handing that over, we need platinum, don't we? That was platinum, wasn't it? Maybe we'll just do gold instead. Sorry, can I have that back? Sorry. Do we need a bigger vessel? She seemed very pleasant. Don't know what Fenna was talking about. Shall we away? Do we need to make any preparations before we go? Do we have all of the materials we need? Santy. Ooh! There's sound effects, first of all. Appreciate the sound effects. If we're going on a three-hour tour, I demand to know who's Gilligan, who's the Skipper, millionaire and his wife. The movie star-- Ginger, yeah. Little buddy! We're crammed on this thing. All right. Let's do this. What? I'm probably next to Percy. I can make a Fireball. (garbled) I can make a Fireball, but it will probably go out really quick. (garbled) No. That's two questions. How about, any tunnels? Should we find out, from nature, how far down in the magma it is? Through rock. Travis, can you say that with your finger flapping on your mouth please? He's just saying. Immune to or resistant to? I have an idea. What if I could make us a tunnel straight down the middle? Would the heat kill us or would the water tamp down the heat? If I can make a ten-foot wide tunnel all the way through, down? The pressure of what? Once it comes up, it becomes rock. Oh, I see. There's more underneath. What tunnels? TRAVIS and Just a straight intelligence check? Eight! Magic. Sorry, Miley Cyrus. Yes? All right, I can be a burrowing monster. Is that a spell? All right, I can burrow. You can deflect water and stuff? Whatever you want. But the currents can't go down because stuff is coming out, no? But you can't control the lava coming up. Oh, it's just gas. It's not lava. I was going to become a purple worm. They're excellent at burrowing and are big and could make a big tunnel. No, but they are stacked with hit points. The toppest. You're going to punch a volcano? Can we fit through whatever hole there is? And the only thing keeping the water from rushing in here is Keyleth? Well, not while casting this spell. That was amazing! Or poison? You're already dead. It's a tube? We're in one of the cow's stomachs. But if we get rid of the water, then we won't have anything to breathe. Okay, go for it. 34? Jesus. Can we walk on it? Is it going to burn our little feetsies? Or do we need to fly? Yes, please. We might run out of water, though, because we're breathing it in. You're right. We're big fish. Let's try it. Oh yeah. We just could have carried water in a jug. We have chalices. It's a water bong? Don't do drugs, everyone. It's plus ten? 31. Oh, okay, that's above something. What about Trinket? Happy Birthday. They can't see us. We'll stand still and we'll be fine, right? What a great board! Ooh! Did a new light just pop on? And another light? For a red lava effect in my eyes? 18! Here we go. This is going to be fun. Boy, man. I don't know what these things can do. I will step forward a little bit. Super tanky. That's good enough for now. No, keep going. Thanks. I will inspire Grog by singing the customary birthday song of his people, which goes like this, (singing) Happy happy happy, happy happy happy-- they're a very simple people-- happy happy happy happy. (groans) (laughter) And then as practice, I'm going to become my beautiful angel self and transform into a naked planetar. I assume I lose everything. I lose my Heroes' Feast-- Because I'm a different creature. I don't think so. Yes. Do you happen to have a planetar figurine? Oh my god. Guys. Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest. Did I mention you can find out more at bit.ly/MagicRole? Capital M, capital R on that, by the way, guys. Visit it right now. Friends of the show. They need your support. Matt is really looking for this thing. In the meantime, let me tell you some other amazing Magic The Gathering cards. I've got Time Twister, Jace the Mind Sculptor-- Naked Singularity. Not a sexual position. It is. Okay, thanks. I think that's all I can do. Oh, that's interesting. As that guy, can I move more? That's another 40 feet. All right. Well, then you guys got this well in hand. I'm going to fly to the other guy. Is he going to get an attack on me? Yeah. As I fly up high? No, I'm going to go to the furthest guy. (whispering) I'm the Crow. Does not hit. Jump into its throat. Duke boys, sliding over the hood of the car? As my holy self, imbued with the holy power of whatever I am, I float up a bit, draw my greatsword that I always use to attack because I'm awesome and bring it down real hard on the head of the thing. No, I'm naked with a sword. I've got a belt. I'm naked with a belt. That is 21. Do I roll, or do I use these stats? Seven, 12, 18 plus seven is 25. Plus I need 5d8. Plus 14. So that's 39, right? On my first attack. All right. Well, then I'll say a silent prayer for the fallen and then fly backwards super fast to the other one (whoosh) and attack again! Oh. 18. Hey! All right. Look at all these crazy things. 12 plus-- that's not very good. 12 plus all those. That's right. 19. (counting) 19. Whatever I just said. Is that 19 plus 19? 34? I feel like there's more coming. What about me? I think I'm dying. I don't know. I think I probably need air. I'll do that. See how I fare. No. I don't think I do. I'm a new body. Interesting. Thank you, Lindsay Lohan. I still can't breathe. Oh! So I can breathe some water. All right, cool. I'm going to cast Detect Evil and then wordlessly speak to you all. I say Brothers and sisters. Allow me to guide us by the spirits of my religious faith down into the depths of this hell place. Yes, my child. Inside. That's by choice. (laughter) Straight down? I'll go down a bit. Am I detecting any evil? I don't know! Where does it say? I can also speak every language! Is there writing or is it just symbols? It says languages all. I agree. Allhammer. Wow. I don't know. Looking. Religion. I don't know. 11 plus I don't know. I'll fly back and report to the rest in my pristine body. My pristine, hairless body. And that is what I saw. Yes. Hold on one second. (blowing water bubbles) (laughter) (blowing water bubbles) And it's all cloudy now from everybody. It's like a horse trough. There's hair. Oh, I didn't try the door. Sorry! It's just a door; we'll be fine. It didn't say anything like that. To me, everything is glowing a little bit. You're inspired. It's all pewter. Pewter everywhere. You know why? Because he knows Liam bought the book. I bought the book, too. What do I get? I'm going to fly over to Vex and wordlessly say to her, be honest. Do you think I'm more handsome like this or as normal Scanlan? Be aware that as a divine being, I can sense any lie. (laughter) All right. Thank you. I turn my little naked butt to her and fly away. (laughter) I don't. I don't have the earring, but I can talk to you telepathically in any language. How about Italian, darling? (laughter) I sense my hour is coming to an end soon. Do we have five minutes left, or less? We could stay like this forever. I'm so beautiful. So symmetrical. I will fly up next to Grog and put my Healing Touch hand on his shoulder and heal him a lot. (hums) 31. Oh, plus three. 34. And you're also freed from any curse, disease, or blindness that you have, just FYI. I'm going to cast, again, Detect Good and Evil, and do a swoop around and see if I sense any creatures or magically consecrated objects. (sighs) Big choice. Yes, my child. I will drop the spell. I feel my back, covered in hair. I'm back. The smelter, is it active right now? Is it hot? What if we have to make something triangular? What if we take those beans and put them in the little triangle holes? I don't know. In their hands?
