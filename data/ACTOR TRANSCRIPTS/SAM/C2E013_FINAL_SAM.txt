I'm ready. In honor of our impending trip to Chicago, I'm dedicating this ad for D&D Beyond to the Second City. One disclaimer like all accents I do, my Chicago accent is "harrible." (laughter) Sausage! There's no such thing! We all die in it. Yes, you did. You rushed the process. 11. No, none of it. Did Beau make out with the Crick? Wow, that was fast. We're up already? Me?! The Xhorhasian? Okay. Uh. Shit, I don't know. Why are we attacking this person? I'm looking around. I'm not seeing a lot of attacking going on. They don't speak our language. Shit. Maybe they speak-- No, I don't know. All right. I will cast Message, and I will point into the darkness at the creature. I'll say Do not fight us! We are no fans of the empire either! You can reply to this message. Do I sense a reply? That's a two minus three. Oh no, just a two minus one, Matt. I'm still in the black. Yeah, I'll go front and left. Is there anywhere to hide? Then I will bonus action dash over there. Oh, it's us again? Oh wait, it's me. Although I don't really know what I'm going to do. Who do I still see? Just Caleb way in the back. Jester-- Do I hear anything? But I don't know where they're coming from? I'm going to go around the darkness. Around it, counter-clockwise, to see if I can see around the other side without going into it. I will bonus dash around, just to look. All right, I'm going to shoot the shadow form. (yelps) 20. Sneak attack? MATT Sure. Technically, yeah, because these are considered one space, there. It was all in my imagination! (laughter) (screams) I know, right? This is crazy! (laughter) What will you sing to her? Oh, wait. No. That's not true. Uh, nope. We were talking. What was the detail? I mean (coo) what was the detail? (cooing) Yeah, drop that BM on him! Oh! Wait, we just healed her. Not in the face! (high-pitched) Watch out for the teeth (coo). (singing) I still get hellish. It's dead. Did he just-- Caleb we need you. Whoa, platinum? Each platinum is worth 100 gold, right? Why do we have to move? We're in the sewers. Who's going to come down here? Oh. That's fair. What if we hide? Could we hide, could we put up an illusion to hide? Won't you lose your other spell if you do the spell? Okay. She got sword, so far. We have to ask him some questions. But we have to leave, right? One more opportunity. Oskar? Yes we need to-- yes. How far are we from the entrance, where we came down into the sewer? Should I go back up to the entrance and make sure we're not being followed or anything? Questions? I don't know anything about this shit. Okay. I'm going to head back and look at the entrance. Seven. No. The language of love. It walks away. Whispers on a 15? Liam, what are you looking forward to in Chicago? Is it the sausages? The brats? The deep-dish? More whispers! Just whispers. It's all whispers. Oh, guys. D&D Beyond, right? What is there to say that hasn't already been said by me? I'm drunk, 120 feet away. (laughter) Yes! It's very clear. They said it four or five times. (whispers) That's the way we were going to go. What are you guys doing coming this way?! We were going the other way! Oh God! Not yet, but now I will be! We came back up. Oh, shit. This is going to be great. Why do you get advantage? He showed it to us. Except for the 112 platinum we just got. Should we go check it out? Why don't we take that thing from them? Those guys don't know what that is. Let's go get it! Sure, if we want it. Do we want it? I'm casting Mage Hand, just in case. I'm just following behind. Behind Jester, by 30 feet or so. May I--? Seeing Caleb walk away with the object, I'm going to cast Silent Image, and make the image of the object, glowing, about 30 feet away from them on the ground. (dissonant humming) Yeah, I guess. My spell DC is-- It's plus-- Oh, sorry, hold on. Silent Image is-- Come on, D&D Beyond. It's plus three is my spellcasting modifier. Okay. It just gives you-- Advantage to charisma rolls. I'm staying put, and as soon as the guard gets close, I'll make it slowly rise up into the sky, just like 12, 13 feet up. This is Silent Image. I can move it. I just can't make it make a sound. (giggles) It’s bigger than that. I'm still doing illusion shit. Have I finished that? I'll make it inflate, and then Salvador Dalí, start dripping. Just like (humming). It's going to start to boil and fizzle into steam, and dissipate. Then I'll try to rejoin them. I know who they're talking about. What's going on? Where are we going? The secret cellar where I found-- nothing. Where we found a skeleton. Yes. Long enough for the body to decompose. Wait, wait, why does it need to be lead? I mean, you can turn anything into lead, can't you? Oh. Why does it have to be that particular material? Pumat would have something. Smart. Look at us! We’re like a team. Break? The stone? Oh, intrigue. Who? What? Who are you talking about? This is the place. Are you with us? This is the place I was talking to you about. The skeleton’s right over there. What? What would that do? All right. Very smart, as always. With the skelly? If we slept in our rooms-- But what if someone breaks in and we're here? Then we're attached to these objects. I mean, I'll sleep down here if you want. Maybe we can get rid of the skelly first. What’s wrong, Caleb? All right. I’m game. What? I mean, we don’t know what Fjord and the grumpy one have discovered. Maybe we should go upstairs and reconnoiter with them and then come down here, when it’s time for beddy-bye. All right. I’ll stay with you, then. Oh yes, I can do that. Should I do that and then come back later? You’re just going to stay here in this dank, dark room with a skeleton by yourself, no dinner. All right. All right. I’ll be back in less than an hour. Flush. Two floors below we're putting a skull-- (laughter) Yorick. So we've got some stuff. What did we get? This? I will taste it. I will lick the safe. It's ironic. It's not what we want. You did very well considering it's after midnight and you got a metal box for free. I don't know, can I tell it's lead-- I mean, iron, not lead? Okay. Just a straight intelligence check? 15. Oh. It's a very well-made safe. He's downstairs for now, but I am in constant communication with him. I take out my piece of wire and I do my incantation and I whisper to it and I say Did the skeleton come to life and kill you? Please respond to this message. He's a prankster. (laughter) Yeah. Lauren Spinach. Should we change to a different hotel? Wait, she was selling this place because of us? I should put on my pants. Why does he need to leave the city? Why do you need to leave? Who's suspicious of you? You can take Caleb and my room. We'll be spending the night somewhere else. I get to spend the night with that guy. I'll take Caleb's share and give it to him. I can take it downstairs later and have Cay-Cay take a look at it. Why don't I just have Caleb look-- I'll take the daggers, unless you can use them to throw, I can throw them at things, I think? That's how they say it in Kentucky. I think that was more you than the dagger, though. For safety. (loudly) Yes, because of-- Oh. All right. Yeah, because of the thing. Caleb's idea. I'm the help. All right, sure. I take out my wire, I do my incantation. I send a Message to him, I say Caleb, are we going to abscond with the dodecahedron in the dead of night? You can reply to this message, and only I can hear your reply. Yes, we are. We're not going to steal it! He's scared of that thing, why would we take it away from you? We do what we need to do to survive. So what? The plan was to leave no trace, not take nothing. He was very clear at the outset that we were doing this for money. No. We caused a giant explosion, we destroyed a rug, we broke into two different places, Mollymauk was seen by guards outside of both; there was plenty of traces we left behind. I opened a box that froze me for an hour! Yeah, I'm pretty sure someone's going to notice that that box has been opened! I'm just saying, him taking a scroll is small potatoes. What Caleb does is well thought-out and always intentional and smart. Stockholm Syndrome? No, I'm not. Explain that to me. What are you implying? Sure. The scorpion rides on the turtle's back... Whatever Caleb says happens next. (laughter) Stay away from the water, is what I take from it! All right, so you are all apologizing for not trusting Caleb's judgment. Not you. All right, and what exactly have you done to earn our trust? I'm not talking about life or death. I've saved your lives, Caleb has saved your lives-- Tonight. Caleb got that dodeca-fuckballs out of there by himself. He has slain things, he has saved things, and I have as well! If we're talking about trust, what on earth have any of you people done to earn our trust? What have you done that we have requested? Ever? I like you. When we signed up for this job, Caleb was very explicit. He said we are doing this for coin and treasure, and that's what we got. There was no surprises here, we're in it for what we can grab for ourselves. I think there's a bit of a misconception here. Caleb and I have a very special relationship. It is that of a parent and a child. But I am the parent. You do understand that, correct? I protect him. He's my boy, and I keep him safe. I want him to thrive and get better and better, and more powerful and stronger. Because he can achieve great things. When I found him, he was nothing. He was a scared little boy in the corner of a jail cell. As we have gotten more comfortable, he has gotten more comfortable and come out of his shell. It's my job to protect him, because I love him, and I am his protector. Not because he protects me. He's going to be a great man someday. That seems like it would be suspicious. I don't know that. I'll have a talk with him. That's very nice, Beau. Yeah, I could tell that there was at least six more fucks in there that you held back. (laughter) As soon as you give me the stuff you want identified. And you'll have to trust me that we won't run away with it in the dead of night. Hey, you're the one who hypnotized me into talking about stuff. Yeah, you think that's what friends do to each other?! I don't think so. You think that's cool, Beau? I was not stealing! I was searching for something to steal. That's besides the point. I don't have Friends, he hasn't taught me that one yet. All right. Maybe you guys can have a talk with her tonight. I know she's drunk, but-- I'm going to leave now. Have a good night, don't break into our room. I'll go down with Caleb. I stole this fucking scroll for you. The one from the Richter’s. I got it. I went back and got it. No. Thank you for saving me tonight. You brought me back from the dead. Oh. I think you used a potion on me, didn't you? Here, take one of mine. I have two, it's okay. Of course. You keep me safe. Thank you. We lived, huh? The folks upstairs gave me some more things for you to check out as well. Are these things you can do? Okay. Oh. All right. (explosion) Oh no! Oh shit! Was it loud enough that anyone else could hear? It was that Agoura Hills earthquake. Smoke? I forget how this works, does he have your hit points? Was there anything in the box? It's a good spell. What did we get? What did we get, what did we get? Yes! Sinterklaas! Oh, and these daggers, too. It's a longsword? Can I use that? (fake crying) Too big for me. I know my limits. Well, should we go to sleep? Oh, here's your 19 platinum, and your two gold, and one extra platinum for some reason, as if that were supposed to smooth things over. Oh, and also, they don't trust us, they think we need to cooperate more, they're trying-- They are very upset-- They were very upset that we tried to take the scroll box. Because they are in the firm belief that it would have left some sort of clue that would have led the authorities to us by stealing something, after we had broken into two houses, stolen other things, torn up a rug-- Not stealing the seal. Sure. Also, she was dressed as the Richter not wearing the correct outfit. Sure. But they are under the impression that, and this a fair point, that we are not very communicative or... We don't behave as much as part of a team as they would prefer. I said that I would tell you and discuss. And so that's where it stands with the weirdos. I think what would make it work is letting them take the lead a bit, and following. Oh no, not at all. But we can just see how it goes, playing ball, I suppose. The Soltryce Academy thing? What? You didn't get in? Did you do something wrong? Or bad? You don't have to tell me what it was, or what you did, but is it something that you can be forgiven for? Our own academy? All right. It'll take a little longer, probably. I'm not a good teacher. All right, well. I'll help wherever I can. I do enjoy seeing you get new spells and new skills. I think for me, too. I've had more people throw rocks at me than conversations, and it's nice. You know what, it's nice with them, too. They don't seem to mind that, you know, my teeth are a little-- People find that off-putting, sometimes. Well, they're not as smart as you are, so. That's nice. I prefer the skeleton, actually. I'll go on that side of the room. Night, Caleb. How do you do this on D&D Beyond? (surprised sounds) I'm in the room! Where do we go? Bring your dice so we can roll. How do you play Dungeons & Dragons?! I got scared of the skeleton so I came over here. That was like two minutes. We had no time to do anything! I roll a d8? Eight! When I leveled up, it already gave me two extra hit points. Why? Okay, so now I add the extra eight. Oh my god, I just got ten extra hit points! No, she's dead now. Ooh! That’s a lot! Do we have to find Dolan now? We've got to get our Nip on. Ooh, wait, maybe not. Oh god, we haven't fed the horses in days. So we left the horses at a stable or something? Okay. They're not dead in an alley somewhere? Get a big catapult and just-- Wait, we know a smuggler. Who was the guy who first showed us around the city? Yeah. Their sister. I totally forgot about that. Or maybe Pumat would have some sort of a magical-encasing-- He doesn't care, does he? We should write Tusk Love and sell it on the store. Was he in Alfield? She. They! Were they in Alfield? Bryce Fayled? Fell-lid? Fee-lid? If Caleb was in the room when Bryce said it, then Caleb would know. There was no sister? Well, if Matt doesn't recall the sister, then it was Claudia! Mystery solved! We did it! Well, that takes one thing off the list. We still need The lead box! Get Horris out of town! The Gentleman! What else? That's the Gentleman also. The Leaky Nip? I mean, the Evening Nip, should we go there? He was telling us about blacksmiths before. There's the Spark Hammer Smith. We could go to the Spark Hammer Smith in the Pentamarket. I think we actually have been there before. Yannick. Jan? He got 75 new spells. I'm a student of magic. We're going to go to the Spark Hammer Smith's. Smithy's. Can it just be lead-lined? Is that a thing? Everybody knows her mom. What is that? What does it do? One little interjection. Couldn’t we use the sending thing to find out information if we sent a message? We could disguise our voice and say, "We’ve been made! Send instructions!" and find out what happens. Sometimes if you scroll through and find a listing for mom? We could probably divvy up the equipment at Pumat's. He won’t ask any questions. You did not! What?! That seems terrible! Oh my god. (banjo music) This is normal, it’s okay! Wait! Mr. Pumat, what is it made of? What does it do? I've heard of the material, but does it have any other magical properties? Okay. Yeah, to replenish. Mr. Pumat, I have another request. I know that I had requested, would it be possible to invent a small haversack? Just the pocket thing. But do you have any sort of magic incantation ability-- if I gave you a flask, could you make it never run out of alcohol? How much would that R&D cost me? I'll take it. (laughter) Oh wow. That's nothing. It's nothing at all. Sure. Here, take it. Yep! All up front! Go to your D&D Beyond app; it has all the manuals. Maybe you should cancel the order. Have him make something else. A flask. Did we get any healing potions? Do you need any more, Caleb? It gets caught in the corners. Good stuff. We still haven't gone there, have we? We've heard about it, like, seven times! Wait, he likes small critters? Like me? He's cool, right? What was the first one? We'll be twinsies. Wait a minute, what does that mean? Nothing. Whatcha reading? They will probably have it. Sounds like shite, Caleb. There are much better books out there. Goodbye. To the Tap? Why are we going there now? Oh, to the box thing! Is the skeleton alive? Can we put the box in the--? Oh wait, we can't put the box in the bag. Crossing the streams. Still crossing the streams. Yes, the items! I'll take those. Why do we only have one? How many weapons can you wield? Gone forever! I defer to the wisdom of the group. We merely follow your expert wisdom. No! I am sincere! What is that crazy expression?! (laughter) I forgot we had that. The Gentleman. We were going to investigate Kara, who was going to the bar that the Gentleman frequents. If it happens, if it comes up. Oh yeah, we have to send the guards to find the evidence! Oh god! And we stole a seal. Hmm. Oh boy. Oh, did we get paid? Fuck that. So we'll go to the Evening Nip? Are we gonna do this? Are we doing the Gentleman? I'm so scared right now. Mazel tov. Who? What? What?! Who's that? He's actually a robot! An hour ago you were telling me that I had to trust you people! You lying fuckers!
