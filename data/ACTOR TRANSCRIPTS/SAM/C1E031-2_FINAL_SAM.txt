Oh! Something's happening! Something's happening in the sky! I think it's a magic wielder of some sort. Something-- I must flee! (laughter) This one's a real quick break. I'm not there. Natural 20. Am I with these guys yet? Me too? Am I there, Matt? Hello. Hi. How'd it go? I set fire to the place, some shit went down, dinosaurs were harmed, but I know you got the smoke signal and used that to attack. No, it was me. It's all good, though. I caused a ruckus, that's all I was supposed to do. To what? To hold the revolution? We need to briefly quell the rebellion? Let's spread word. We can spread word. Let's find a few-- Can you Skywrite something like "attack tomorrow" or "hold"? First of all, it's raining outside. It's daytime. There's no vampires out there right now, right? They don't like water, do they? I'm sure they don't like it. In any case, the only thing that our rebels are rebelling against right now are six zombie giants, one of whom I'm pretty sure they killed already. Did I see them? There were six. No, but maybe we could-- I admire this fire in your eyes, but it's so stupid. What time did he say it was? Wait a second, what about that, what about that cleric, the religious man that you've talked to. Could he get a message out to everybody? What's his name? Archibald? Is that his name? What are you talking about, why? Of course they knew we were coming, we killed one of their-- What do you want to know? We need to rest. Wait, join the rebellion or ride around town telling everyone, "quell?" No, I can sing a Song of Rest for all of us. MARISHA and It gives us all 1d6. That's pretty weak. Okay. (sings) Health! We need some now. Health! Not just anybody. Health! You know you need someone. Oh, he died. That's two down. Splash two. Do we have horses? We don't have any horses, do we? Except we haven't killed the members of one of the houses. By the way, my Song of Rest is a d8. But we haven't killed the last one. Now, the one that you guys killed. What's his name again, Tylieri? He was a vampire. Because Sylas killed him. Right? And then made him a vampire. Didn't he hang him on the Sun Tree? I don't know. Didn't that guy that we meet... And then he became a vampire. Is that where they're spawning? That doesn't seem right. Yes, we talked to a guy at the bar. What about him? Well, yes, we know that, yes. Four. The tree is the spawning spot. Or maybe one of them. We've got to cut down this tree. Wait, what? We've got to get out of here! I blow my Horn of Fog to create a smokescreen. I don't know what the fuck she's doing. Nope, not by magic. Oh my god. She's been wearing a dress this whole time? Oh. Well. I didn't do it. Yes. While you decide, which way are we going, Percy? West or east? You need your spells. We need to hide. We need to run. Let's get out of here! We have to go. We have nothing left.
