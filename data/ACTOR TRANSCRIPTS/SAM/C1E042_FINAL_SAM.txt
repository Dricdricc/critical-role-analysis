I want to be the rat! Oh yeah, I want to give a quick shout-out to my charity of choice, the Pablove Foundation. I talked to them today. Their minds were blown by all the gifts that people have sent in and donations in the name of Critical Role and the Critter community. They didn't quite understand what the Critter community was, but I enlightened them, and they're so jazzed by you guys. And they appreciate not just the donations and gifts, but also, they said that the Critters have been writing long letters and telling great stories and stuff, and they're super excited. So keep it going to those charities. The Pablove Foundation. The Pablove Foundation. Oh, yeah. Kill all the dragons and save the day. That's a great, great idea. Why are you rolling before the show? Where are we? And Gilmore's with us? Is Clarota still here with us? (laughter) We bought new silverware. Maybe it wasn't my troupe, maybe it was our new guests, the people fleeing for their lives. That guy. Man-crush? I wonder, in all prudence, should we go around to the 'fugees, the refugees and do a quick-- -- scan, alignment check or something? Pike might. Can you do a mass, a mass sense alignment? Is that a thing? Oh, I'm talking about your magic. All right. Is she with us? Maybe we should just kill one of them to make an example. Is this insight? What are our options here? First of all, do we know Gilmore's status? And when we last left things, there was one plan to go into the tunnels of the thieves' guild and try to see if there's any more-- And to what end, again? We're going to see if there's any random diplomats left over? For death? What did you do? Was it because you farted that time? Yes, what are our other options? We know why the dragons are here, right? Ish? Huh? I've been thinking about that, long and hard. Yes. Most of what I do is long and hard. And my thoughts are still fuck you, no way, fuck off. Maybe. (laughter) Maybe the triceratops could kill all the dragons. How's your homeland? Do we need to find out? You can transport there instantly. True. How do you kill a dragon? Do we need a dragon? Can we get a dragon that hates these dragons? Is that a thing? Yeah, could we find a dragon who could fight for us? Do we know any metallic dragons? So, wait, the Slayer's Take, what? It's safe. Yes, but they're protected. Not phone calls, just a look. Okay, well, let's scry it up, then. Who are we calling? Whitestone, Vasselheim, center of Emon? You're pretty smart, Grog. Oh, Pike! Oh. Thanks. Pike! Pikey! I reach out and brush the dirt from above her forehead. Can you scry? We do. Or a walkie-talkie. He's saying, Syngorn is gone. Oh no, he didn't even get a new franchise before it was-- Gilmore's Building Supplies. (laughter) What did you see, Keyleth? Lay. Did it look like it was destroyed to nothing? Or transported somewhere? Could it have been-- I don't know how your scrying works-- could it have been some sort of a magical block? Not real, an illusion of some sort? To where? But there's hundreds more inside the city walls. Thousands. You're going to steal a plane? What does? Who? Are we going to check in with the Clasp? I really like Percy's idea about stealing a plane. I'm just throwing that out there. We could take all of these refugees with us. Don't you understand? We would be helping humanity. Not if we hide it with some-- some smokescreen action of some sort. All right, let's go talk to the Clasp. We'll ask them what they think about-- We probably can only take a few. It should be women and children. Bundle up! We'll give you some wool blankets for the trip! No, nothing, she didn't say anything. Hey! We're going to be doing this every day for several days. This is just how Schindler did it, by the way. He debated it for a while, and then-- (nervous laughter). Wait, there's a rope? Leave them here, in case the parents come. What are you talking about? Can I inspire Keyleth for this? Okay, I will perform a limerick for her to inspire her. I know an airheaded young druid / whose plans are more gassy than fluid / when the battle starts / she turns her pals into farts / they see danger and pass right through it! You've got inspiration if you need it. Well, I hope Percy comes back soon. (whispers) Steal an airplane. I'm telling the, what, seven remaining refugees? Sorry you didn't make it through. It doesn't mean that you'll be here forever. We'll get you there tomorrow. No big. Don't worry about it. That's great. Did you see your sister? What is it? I love it. How? Do you shoot it at something? That's a great idea. Could we fire it from an airship of some sort? Should we go visit the Clasp? Everyone? Some? All? Vex, are you okay going down there? You're marked for death by these people. I know, I feel like it might put you on edge. What are we doing? Okay. It puts us in the wrong side of the city, but it's okay. Into the city. Oh, and we get a plus ten, right? 15. Wait. With no judgment, is Trinket coming? That's a fine decision. They're diving into the city? Sorry. Sorry. He sees me? I see him? Okay. I will cast Hold Person on him. I don't know what he is, but I want him to stop. Well, it's 17, but the hand-cone makes it 19. Do you think I had the wherewithal to use it? Yes. Possibly. (singing) This is the music that plays when we fight! That's me! Yikes. Eight! No, seven. Do it! Clank! Yeah, that'll work. How far are we from the tunnel system? Far. Oh. Shit. With advantage? Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay. I know! What's wrong with you? Blame me, blame me. Oh, shit. Do I see this? I'm going to release my-- Okay. 19! I will release my Counterspell. I assume he's casting something. And I will-- I will sing at him, (singing) And you still haven't hit what you're aiming for! Oh, balls! I'm a little man! 3d8 damage? Do I have to make a save? What kind of save? And I'm on the ground. That's a nine. Oh, me? Balls. Shit. I'm on the ground. If I stand up, that's my action? That's half my movement. Okay, I'll stand up. He doesn't get to hit me, right? Okay. Which riders are still on their beasts? I will ignore the guy next to me and I will Hand Cone it up, and I will-- he's got two riders? Two riders?! I guess I'll Dominate one of them. The main guy. He's not a person. I'm going to dominate the guy in front. Maverick, not Hollywood. Well, at the end, it was Hollywood. Merlin?! Merlin was the teacher, the guy who spun out. Hollywood was the guy who was his-- Can I only give it one command per turn? Well, I've got two things to do. He's got to get rid of that fucker on his back, and also other things. Let's go for the big kahuna. I command him to ride his beast to attack the one below him. The wyvern below him. No, I don't want to move because he'll hit me. That would be bad. Who hasn't gone? You haven't gone. Vax hasn't gone? Oh my god. Okay. I will inspire Vax with my inspiration. And I will say This is ground control to Major Vax, you've really made the blade. And the papers want to know whose blood you spilled! Rest in peace. Yes! Just call it cloak number seven. No, he's my guy. I Dominated the guy. I don't know. I don't know. Do I keep hold of my guy? Oh. Okay. Thank God. Team colors. Same day. Reckless. Yeah, one down! Get on the wyvern and kill the other one. You have pleased me. (laughter) Grip it harder! (groan) Oh, God. I'm going to use Cutting Words on the last guy. I'm going to just-- (plays flute badly) to distract him. d10. Which one's ten, I never remember. This one. Nine! Oh, that's not a good sound. A bite with advantage! That's the damage it does? (rasping breath) I did. Ah! That was close, guys. I saw my mother! Then I saw myself at math class, failing. Oh yeah. Okay. Advantage on concentration checks. Two whats? Well, I only have one d20. How many-- oh, for each thing that-- constitution modifier. Holy God. Okay. I'm counting both of those, the first one's only 12. Okay. So I got to do two more? Yeah, that's 16 plus two. 17 plus two. Two plus two. Seven plus two. Nine. No good. No bueno. No, no, I know you did. You shot me on the last turn, I remember. Yeah, you got me good! You got me good! Matt does not deserve that kind of language. It's my turn?! Oh yeah! If I had a potion, that would be great! I will do Thunderwave-- Thunderwave at third level. Sure, man. What is it, 4d8? Did they all fail? Did they both fail? Ten. 17! Bonus action, I will Healing Word myself-- I can do that at higher levels? Yes? I'll do it at a level four. And I will sing to myself; sadly, pathetically, (breathy) I get knocked down, but I get up again. Ain't never going to keep me down. (laughter) Okay, 4d4 plus five-- That's 14 plus five.19. Run, run, run. Stab. Run, run, run. Stab. Those are the two buttons on the Vax video game. (laughter) Oh, hell yes. Your hands are so rough and masculine. "I turn someone into a chicken." Oh god, we're all going to die. (whispers) Did you get me away from-- because I-- Why don't you use that all the time!? Pew! Hey! That's nice! Oh, hi, thanks for checking on me. Could you move for a second? I'm going to kill this thing. (laughter) That's true. I will Wand of Magic Missiles him. I'll use six of my seven. Okay, the first, okay, so is that 6d4 plus one? Well, it's weird, because my-- 6d6 plus six? Sorry, it's close. One more? 12 plus what? Six? 12 plus six. 18. I think so, I mean, I'm okay. I'll heal myself a little bit more with another level one Healing Word. Okay. Seven more points-- yay! Sorry I made a noise, guys, sorry. Wait, wait, wait-- these stingers are on the end of tails? LIAM and Grog, can you chop off their tails and we'll take the tails with us? Aren't half of them burned to a crisp anyway? I give us cover. I'll blow my Horn of Fog. Do you need me to come? Oi? How do you know I'm Scanlan? I could be in disguise, but yes I do. You would have to attune it to yourself-- is that right? Oh no no no, requires attunement. What do you think? I can instantly make us, with Seeming, I can instantly make us all look different. Or just you. Yeah, no-- (smarmily) It's pretty high-level stuff-- What if I-- ooh! I cast Minor Illusion and give her a moustache. What about that? Is that pretty good? All right, I dispel it. A limerick for you? Oh! You're going to give me a limerick? That was excellent. Wait-- me or her? Wow. That's impressive. Here's the hat. You can use it-- In about 20 minutes you'll be able to use it. Towards the sounds, yes? I abstain. With inspiration. Garthok! We got held up by some wyverns. I almost died, it was crazy. We're here now. Hey. It's all right. Ooh! I like him already. Yes, you are. (whispers) Spireling Shenn? Nine, you said? (whispers) I would, too. No, go for it. And to The Slayer's Take-- that's what they're called, right? Yes? There could be a formidable force that could come to protect the city or drive out the dragons. Indeed. They are a mighty force. I know I'm getting a bit ahead of ourselves, but once the dragons are gone and the city's returned to normalcy, what is your ultimate goal? To hold power or to remain in the underbelly? We may very well be the person that comes to power in this city. We have to have something to sweeten the pot. What are you offering, money? We can't promise that! The dragon could very easily kill us! Yes, we do. We know some high-ranking clerics. We know the Slayer's Take. We met a bunch of people up there. If we come back and learn that you have made a deal with the dragons, you'll be the first to die, not them. All right, then let's do this. Keyleth, shake the man's hand. You've got nice soft hands. Would you like me to sing to give you some extra strength for that arm? We're going to leave the city abandoned? With no one to protect it? I look at Garthok and say, "Even you?" Don't do it, Grog. I say, party on, Garthok. And then we leave. Well, that was a bust. Or very well. That's not a thing. Shall we go back to our keep? 19. Good job, Percy. Before we go to the keep, do you want to swing by the place? The place with the airships. Just to go there and look? All right. All right. All right. Back to the keep then, I guess. When we get there can we check in on Gilmore and the queen? You sure you don't need it? All right. Keep up those rhymes. Not bad for a first timer. (laughter) You know, Vex, I don't want to be alone right now. (laughter) How do we get there? Wait, we have to get rid of all the 'fugees. Yes. Ooh, la la la. We're abandoning the keep? When we come back, our keep will be gone. But my room is just the way I want it. All right, if we're going to leave the keep, I'll need a moment in my room. You look like you're glowing this morning. I've never seen you quite so chipper. All right. Don't you need your tools? Before we go out there, I go to my room, I take a dump on my bed-- No, it's not a potion. Just a straight-up poo. I hang a note on the gate of the keep. I don't want anyone else to use it. And with a butter knife, I put a note on the gate to the keep that says, "If Kaylie comes, go to Whitestone. P.S. If my painting is delivered, "please forward to Scanlan Shorthalt, care of Whitestone." Can you make it disappear, or something? Do we need to talk to anybody here? We may want to stock up on potions and stuff before we leave. How are we getting to Vasselheim? Is that true? The nubbin. 300 gold. So we're going to a tree outside of the city? The guy who beat you twice? LIAM, LAURA, AND We should talk to the Slayer's Take, as well. What's that? Pyrah? Oh. Thank you, Mertin. Right? Perhaps we could see her. How's Lyra? Have you seen her? (laughter) Not in a while, but we thought you guys were engaged to be married. No? Not from a reliable source, I promise you. Not in a long time. No! She seems nice to me. You saw her first. I'm a man of honor. True love. Well, I guess we should ask them all if they want to come with us to fight a dragon? We'll sleep on it. We'll talk to Nessa in the morning. Okay. Kord's strength to us all. Kashaw. That was the one that they went on a-- Would we have done that? Zahra sounds fun. Oh. Yeah, I'll come watch you if you're going to have a fight. Watch you lose again.
