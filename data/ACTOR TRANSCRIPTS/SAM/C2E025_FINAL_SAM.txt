I can't turn it off! It won't stop! I can't smile. Guys, I didn't know this. The D&D Beyond discount code, 826LA, is still active for the 25% off the legendary bundle. I did not know that. It will be expiring soon, so please make sure to check out the legendary bundle on the D&D Beyond marketplace. Also, the site will be undergoing some maintenance tomorrow, Friday morning, starting at 700am Pacific for a few hours. The site will be in read-only mode at this time. So, I don't know what that means. Also, the product director Adam Bradford will be hosting a stream at 900am Pacific during maintenance with some exciting announcements! Be sure to tune in to twitch.tv/dndbeyond (not and) to check it all out. And just for my little extra here tonight, not getting lost in the fact that Travis and Laura are having the most magical day of their lives and Liam is gone, I wanted to pay special tribute to our little Ashley who's leaving us for a while. I feel like she should get some love too on her way out the door. I composed a song for you in the style of your favorite band, Boyz II Men. (singing) How do I say goodbye... shit. To our sweet, innocent harbinger of death fallen angel? On NBC you play a geek, but you're a real one here with us every week. If we get to visit Xhorhas, I hope Blindspot will let you play. But until then, I hope Patterson dies every day! That's hard to do in a mustache. This is what I did the first time through the campaign, so that's what I gotta do this time! This is what I wore this time in the first campaign. I did not decide. This was put upon me by the fates. Yeah. I can't un-make it. Oh, the monkey’s here, right? Okay, good. Oh, what? Okay. Will one of them be a baby? You're pretty good, though. You said late morning? Midday? So we could at least go check out this prison and do some scouting before nightfall, yeah? Oh, the teenagers. Yeah, you just had a baby, I understand. Rissa knows the town, though, she might be able to help us scout out this prison. Why don't we have Fjord and Jester go tell their employers! Which one are you? Are you Jester? Oh, yes. Well, let's find out if we need it yet. I guess we're all going. All right. Lowerdook. Fuck those guys. They'll be fine. How would they find the kids? Hmm. We did. Oh, yes. You have that spell, don't you? To Fitz and Ashton. To Fitz. You have, like, eight words left. Go back to work. That's true. A lot of that was hyphenated. And the stuff they're making is catapults or guns? Cool. What's that place called again? Is it heavily protected? It just rolls and cuts. It's inside of it, I would assume, right? What did your father call this "robit"? The Gearkeeper. Would anyone believe that? Not by the city. Hmm. Well, the main concern is getting in the prison. I don't know if walking up to the front door and saying, "Hi, we're here to take care of your spinny death problem," is going to work. Do we need outfits or something? What, like Orkin man outfits, or do we need to look like we're official? But they don't like her father. Heist-type maintenance workers uniforms? I just want to wear a onesie. Ooh. That sounds like something that's way too smart for Laura to say. I love a pie. Why? You playing five characters at the same time? We'd like a hospitable meat pie. Oh. We have money again, don't we? When the whistles blew, Matthew, did we see any guards do a shift change at the prison? Seven. Oh. Okay. Oh, yes. We've brought gift. We could steal the crossbow. We don't have to do the mission at all. I could, just saying. Is that a cymbal crashing? She's clever. No. She's a wily one. He's eating that extra meat pie. Gnome. Just wait it out. You are fucking crazy, Cleff! Or maybe Yasha could hit it with her sword. Question. Can it climb? Cleff, when you were building this thing, you were building it off-site I assume, right? No, I mean off the prison site, not-- So you don't know any extra secret entrances or exits to the prison itself? That's enough to smear a lens. I could put a meat pie on the end of one of my bolts and shoot it at it. Or just tar or something. Maybe on the walk, we can see if we can find a tar restaurant. In a bucket? It has to be a little hot. Hey, you could heat up a bucket of tar as we walk into a prison. That wouldn't be suspicious at all! This is the worst night ever! No! I’m committed! I've got two spares if I need it! MARISHA, ASHLEY, and Let's go. Do you need a drink to soothe your nerves? But it would really help. In a smothering way. We're just going to walk up to the guards and say we're here to dismantle the "robit," right? All right, let's do it. Who's going to be doing the talking? Yeah. Yeah, no, I think Fjord would agree with that. Tar first. Where do we go for tar, the Iron Lot? I'll look for that. 18. And we're behind a gate? And there's workers everywhere? This is at the Assembly Yard? Ah, why would you-- no. We could just walk in and pretend to be a worker and just grab a bucket. We could just sneak in the gate. What's his range? How far is it, Matt? Ten minutes!? Oh, okay. I'll walk around and see if there's a way through the gate that's hidden. Ten. Okay, let's see if Schmidt can-- Juggle something? Wait, you're going to jump the fence? No, this is a distraction. You're not supposed to jump in the-- Oh god. When Schmidt comes close enough, yes. It could go now, but we can't go fast, they'll see a moving bucket. Okay, I'll cast Mage Hand. Are people looking right now? Okay. I'm just going to wait until they finish their conversation. As he starts walking, I'll nod to Caleb and try to do the lift over the fence. Sleight of hand? 22. Yeah! We have a bucket of tar! Part one of our plan is complete. Look at that teamwork. Yeah, everybody contributed a little. Except for Jester and Fjord, everyone was really good. Let's put the tar bucket in the haversack of holding, if that's possible. If it will fit. I don't know. Then we're carrying a bucket of tar. Is that weird? All right. We'll just carry it. Yeah. Persuasive Beau. How many doors are there? We're doing this now? If I'm going to be throwing tar at this thing, maybe I should have it. I could. All right. So the guards will take us down? She can't. She's out of spells. Didn't we use a bunch? Those are high-level spells. Okay. Does it say how many spells she has left? Oh, it reset, but she definitely had used some. In case this all goes tits-up, do we want to try to talk to these guards and maybe figure out what cell the Schusters are in? I'm not talking to them. But someone with more charisma than me? Oh. Charming Caleb. I mean, is that worth doing now? No, but I mean if the warden doesn't give us what we want. Okay. But we're in the prison. All right. Okay. Yeah, sure. I'm going to look at the-- --the dodecahedron while we're at it. Lift? Oh, sure. Okay, I'll use Mage Hand to hold it up. Yeah, I'll hold it with my Mage Hand. Ah! Oh, but we were about to fight. That's not good. Sure. I'll sneak over to the door and try to unlock it. Or see if it's locked. I'll pick a lock. That's is a 14. Four. I don't know what's in it. I can't see anything through it, can I? What's in that room? What an amazing mini. That's rough. If the thing comes out here we're all dead so we should probably figure out a way to stop it. All right, but I can't open it. Does the door have holes? That's not a door, it's just a cage. That's pretty good. Let's move quickly, though. If we went inside that room, though-- The creature would probably give up and go back into hiding until we came out, I would assume. Sure. That's scary and dangerous. It's a terrible idea, but go for it. Does Jester have her Spiritual Weapon out? Okay. Maybe we should get it ready. Wait, what? We can make some, right now! Quietly! All right, well, plan B. Do you want me to scout ahead to the area that you've seen? Or the cat, yes. How about the cat goes to the area where Molly has seen. Which, Liam, for you, is the bottom left of the picture I sent you. No, this is the one that-- The first explored room, that Molly has seen a little bit of. LIAM, Sorry. I was looking at my spellbook and not paying attention to you lot. What were you hoping me to do? I'm going to re-cast Mage Hand and pick up the bucket of tar. Towards the narrower hallway. Yeah, just on the edge of it. Do I hear any movement or anything? The room? Oh god! Save? 21. Whoa! Who are you? Seven. Caleb and Jester are six, Molly and Nott are both seven. This is it. This is it. Kick it in the ball! Clang! Yeah, Fjord! Plus three from? The Gearkeeper. I probably have my crossbow out. I’ll hit it with my crossbow. Yeah. 18. Do I get a point of damage? Yeah! Eat it! I need a new crossbow, is what I need. It can do that?! Cleff, you madman. Oh, rough. 12. Because I hit it with my thing, do I no longer have a reaction? Oh, shit. Is its lens out? So go for the lens? Bonus action, I will use the Mage Hand to deliver the tar right on that lens. There is no bonus to that. Well that’s-- how do you feel about that? Well, it fell so we’ll never know what it was. 17! Our plan worked perfectly. How far am I from the thing? Do you think I’m in melee range? Can I use my action to disengage? Okay. I will disengage and run. Straight to the place I just came from. Sure. Ooh, nice. Why can't we hear you? Simple Sacred Flame? (imitating Taliesin) We're going to do Guiding Bolt. That door actually opens and closes, Matt? Up the butt. Does it have a butt, Matt? Does it poop? Everyone poops. Ooh! That's exactly how he talks. Oh no! Not my sweet boy! (cat yowl) My mustache is falling off, so I better hold it on with another mustache. Get up under them plates! Oh no. So far we've learned today that Fjord sounds like this (goofy chuckling) Useless! I'm going to scoot around and fire a crossbow at it. That's a 15 plus seven to hit. Is it within melee and stuff? Well, that wasn't good at all! That's eight. I'll use my Fury Of The Small. That's another five points. Terrible. I can't really do anything. You know what, I'll take out my last burning bolt, that should be magical, load it up and fire that. But that doesn't hit. I just wasted it. It's 14. Damn it! What are you talking about? I'm going to duck back a little bit. Can he use the rest of his movement to work on his Jester accent? (Jester voice) Technically! Now? I don't know, can you get in there? Is the guts exposed? It's pronounced-- SAM, MARISHA, and Yeah. Where? Oh no, Caleb, you're in that cone. Oh no, he's dead already! (singing) Open the door on your mystery date. Caleb, you have to make a dex save. How? You're pinned to a wall! Marisha, do one for Fjord. How about you, Cay? Cay-Cay? Low, okay. How's she? Do that thing you do, Beau. Sure? I mean, I don't have much. I'll walk up there, poke around the corner, shoot a crossbow bolt, do my thing. That's a big hit. 25. Ten, halved. I guess? These attacks are so weak. I don't know what else to do. I don't have anything else to do. Yeah, I guess I'll shoot another one. Why not? That hits, 23. That's another six points, halved. Take those shots, Mollymauk. Is it the Snitch? Where did you get that? Ecks versus Sever. Does she have a Cure Wounds? I'm going to run back and see what was back over there. Can I open the thing? 13. Caleb, I need you to come open this door. Yasha, I need you to come kick in this door. You're bigger. You're bigger in spirit and heart. I believe in you. Oh, wait! I'm going to use this, Matt. I'm going to try to bend fate and try to repick the lock. I know. It's a lot. (laughter) Anything near the bodies? This I'm good at. One. (laughter) Old prison poop. Should we retrieve the magic core or anything as proof of what we did here? Wherever it stays. Well, let's take this stuff back up to the warden? (knocking) We're done. Let us out. Guards! On our way out, do I see my bolt anywhere? 12. It only triggers if it hits? It was an incredible device. You could have told us the eye had a protective windshield wiper device. Poppin Drokrusher. It's all right. Let's have a meat pie. (laughter) They're at your house, the butcher place? Don't worry, we'll take you there. They're being kept safe by a tiny bird with a dagger. Sometimes the people that help you are the least expected. Yes! Yes, we'll come back and check on Kiri. Be a good girl, Kiri. I guess everyone knows at this point, so it's okay now. Thank you for listening to us. That felt really good, guys! It's nice being good people. We can do more things in this city? Yes, that's right. I guess we should go visit Cleff. Who says it's mine? It could be any of ours. I mean, mine's a little busted, though, so it would be nice. I can fix that. Probably. Okay. Worth a shot. Well, we just came to say goodbye; we're probably rolling out of town soon. And, you know, I mean, if you had an extra crossbow lying around. A beta testing sort of a thing? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Sure. Okay. Yes. Ugh. I love it. It's great. Thank you. Thank you, Cleff. I'm sure he's going to invent many new, excellent devices. I think they're on the road to recovery. Yes. She's not going anywhere! What are you, crazy, Caleb? She's fine! Come on! You're crazy! It's fine! Is that where we're going next? Are we making our way out of town? On the way out of town-- you said when we came into town there were some guards with pistols, with guns? Do we see any on the way out? 14. I'm going to try to steal it. With either Mage Hand, or my own hand, whatever's-- Mage Hand. What am I doing? Sleight of hand? Oh. 19, then. So not sleight of hand, this is a dexterity check. Oh, well then it's 22. Okay. Great. It's loaded with a bullet, though, right? Okay, cool. Great. That's all I care about. You go. I got a nine. Oh god. Whoa! She’s a bad motherfucker. Was she taken and Fjord and Jester? All in the same cart. We heard it with our passive perception. Oh, I forgot to tell you that I never went to sleep and I was watching the whole time! Well yeah, blood. Yeah, we’ll get a black light. (laughter) Mm-hmm. Thank you, Matt for making this game work with half of a crew. I’m sure they’re sound asleep right now. Just getting a good night’s sleep. (laughter) The first night is rough!
