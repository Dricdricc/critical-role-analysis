Go log on to GeekandSundry.com, slash "find it on that site somewhere." And you can find it on Spotify. There's some cool songs on there. Yeah. There's some panty peelers in there, too. I wrote it in the song description. Somebody edited it out. (laughter) Sam Riegel. That was quick. Love that one. Aw, there is, and it's singing! Just wearing a mouse pad? (laughter) What I do is I favorite the geekandsundry.com website. I check it every morning when I wake up. That's what I do. It's my news in the morning. Wait, do I go up or down? Did it work? Ah! So strong! (laughter) Does he even know what he's saying? All right, let's go. Oi. Yes? Are you asking me to make you into a cow right now? Because I think this is not the right time. Why do you think that? Four hands? Oh, full hands. Okay. You didn't feel them? You touched her hand and it just passed right through? That's an illusion of some sort, yeah. I don't know what, but yes. If I were to cast Seeming on us, or some other sort of magic, it would make us look one way but not feel that way. She's a caster of some sort? Should we go find out? I don't know. (laughing) Let's go find out. I have-- No. Well. Oh, Keyleth? I think we should. That prisoner over there is casting magic of some sort. What if she's-- Yeah, what if she's a guard? Well, then we should find out now and kill the shit out of her. Well, you've got to figure it out right now. I could go talk to her, and meanwhile she could be fiddling with her magic behind me. He doesn't shoot daggers All right, so I stroll over back to the cell. Oh, flanked by Grog. Yes. Oi. Old lady. Listen. We said we were going to come back for you and release you when all was said and done, but we cannot make that promise if you don't tell us the complete truth. Now, we know that you're using magic of some sort. Tell us who you really are. We are smart little people. And big people. And we can sense that you are casting magic of some sort on yourself to disguise yourself. Now, I have some familiarity with this, so I make no judgment as to why, but please reveal your true self to us or else we cannot trust you and we will leave you here to rot and possibly die. "Now, I do it now?" I must say, you look way better like this. Extremely. Yes, so who are you for real? How would you know anything about them? We'll never know until he and Ripley kill us all. We may chain you to a bear, but yes. Vax? Get a chain ready, or a noose of some sort. Shall I inspire you? Fucking doors! Bear-ly? (groaning) Should we shackle her? Oh? All right. Things? They let you have things in a prison cell? We have to go to your room? Oh boy. Let's all follow her, right? You would like to enter. Maybe they've been drawn out by the thing that we incited outside that's been going on for like 45 minutes now? Are there any open doors? Does she have a window in her room? We're at her doorway, aren't we? For sure. What are you getting? Why would we let her have a weapon? It could be useful. And shoot her with it. (laughter) We've gone up, right? Vex, what you saw through the window, should we move through the castle quickly because it's unguarded? Okay, let's go. Are they open? Grog, using your noggin. She's a fangirl. So you're leaving her the weapons but no ammo? Yeah, Grog! Grog with the steal. All right, do you have your shit? Can we get out of here? Anything you could use, Percival? Up or down? Classic Percy. I reach out and I take out my potion of acid resistance and I drink it. (laughter) Hurry up. Time is of the essence. Wait, what? Downstairs. Where would this professor be? Wait, we're going down? Just the tip. Yeah! Yeah. Of course. That's two lucks. 19. I'm up? I run as fast as my little legs will take me. 25. I can't see them, so I'll just inspire-- Who's going to get in there next? Who's behind me? Can I inspire people that I can't see? All right. They can't even make it in the next turn, right? Sure. I will inspire Vex, behind me, and I'll say, (sings) Arrows and bows, they fire at our foes and kill them, and they make them ghosts. They won't let go. SAM and Professor Anders. Oh no. Dominate goliath. Hulk versus Wolverine! (laughter) Do you know it's her? Do you know what she looks like? Okay. I continue my long journey into the room. So I have to make a ranged shot if I'm to do anything. What do I see? Can I see how rough Vax is? Looks normal to me. Okay, I'll go for them. Wand of Magic Missiles. And I'll shoot three at the one at the left. That's the first charge, and then use three additional charges on the one on the right. I roll every day, and I restored five and I had used five, so it's back to normal. I have seven total. An additional three on the other. Right, 3d4. Okay. 3d4 plus three? Is that right? Is that how it works, Matt? Okay, so five (mumbles), eight. Lame. And (mumbles) nine, no wait. Yes, nine. Oh, and I will inspire Grog. (sings) This is the dawning of the age of a-Grog-ius. Age of a-Grog-ius. A-Grog-ius! (laughter) Do I see him? I take out my broken shawm and I (piercing whistle). And I cast Counterspell on him. Wait, I have to tell a level, don't I? Do I know, because he's a bard, what he's doing? Then I cast it at fourth level. Uh-uh, that door is locked, motherfucker! (laughter) With inspiration. Yeah, Trinket does. Come on, Trinket. Don't give him an attack of opportunity. Did you hit? Okay. Oh, me? Oh man, I can't do anything against these fuckers. All right. I'll enter the room, I suppose. Just a little. Right there. Just the tip, and shit. I don't want to waste anything on these fuckers. Okay, let's see here. I'll just do-- 2d8. All right, I'll run up. Actually, a little bit closer to the guy closest to me. What does that mean? He won't be for long. So I get up close in, like five feet away, and then I'll just Thunderwave him. I do that thing where frat boys do the chest bump. Yeah. (grunts) That's just like 2d8. I believe it is, yes. I did. It's only nine points of damage. Oh, yes. That hits. Hey, that misses! You can hit things? He's got armor. It did. They're tough.
