Hi! (clears throat) Little tickle in my throat, sorry. Hi guys! As you all know, I am a bit of an amateur inventor. This is no news to you guys. Some of my most notable inventions have been the pet hot air balloon, the smell-over-Skype plugin, and of course the Nintendo Virtual Boy. But this new one I invented for our friends at D&D Beyond. It's an invention that I made-- I call it the D&D Beyond Merciri. It's all the organizational power of D&D Beyond in a tricked-out smart speaker, with a helpful voice that some of you might recognize. I'll demonstrate it for you right now, guys, okay? Merciri, what's the best way to organize your D&D characters and campaigns? Hey, see, it works! Merciri, tell me about the halfling race. Okay, Merciri, cancel. Merciri, who's the best player on Critical Role? Okay. That's fine. Merciri, who's the smartest player on Critical Role? That's true, that is true. Okay, fine. Merciri, who are the top three cast members on Critical Role by popularity? Okay, he's not in the cast. There's some bugs. Fine, Merciri, could you please list the most handsome male cast members, with a beard, who are not Taliesin, Liam, or Sam? Fuck you. Wait, can you do that list one more time, Merciri? Yeah, so she doesn't even have a beard, Merciri. That's true. Okay. Merciri, roll a d20 for me. Merciri, roll another d20 for me. Fuck you. Oh my fucking god! Well, I guess it's back to the drawing board, guys. Let's wrap this up Merciri, could you tell the people where they can find D&D Beyond? Okay, thank you. Thank you, guys. Look for this in stores soon. And thank you, Merciri. It did! I'm a good inventor! I'll be in the chat saying, "I know, right?" The whole time. I'll do the Travis thing, ready? No, we have them here? Whoa! It's bigger than everyone. Is there another one? Oh shit! We're taking this one to Kinko's later to make copies. He's really good. I love it when you abandon it halfway through the word. But my husband. We spent three months searching for your backstory. (laughter) I hear in Xhorhas, they have a captain there who has lots of eyeballs that you can ingest into your body. Yes. Lots of golden eyeballs that you can put in your belly. All right, what are we preparing? Me too, but I'm not very perceptive. I'll go with you. I'm with Marisha-- I mean Beau. Wherever she is. Yasha's in the back. Sorry, Matt. Where would we put it otherwise? Where's the tripod and stuff right now? We don't know that. It might be very nice there. Let's just make sure you don't get captured and your bag doesn't get grabbed. We're just looking on the bright side of things. Are you scared? Or a firefly. We could catch it in a jar. See? Look, Beau, we have a plan. Profit. Yeah, just roll a nature check. It's fine. Traps? No, they wouldn't think anyone would be following them. They covered up the thing with 200 feet of earth and rocks. We're in the bored-out tunnel that the worm made, right? There's no water near us, because we passed water on the way in. You know that thing where you've gone so far that you can't really-- we can't turn around, can we? It feels like it would be a waste of a day. We've got to keep going. You could tattoo with it. Vivid dreams, man! Me three. Xhorhas. Is that it? Getting good at this. We're making the right choice. It really is sexy. On we go! Oh my god! No! Ah! Well, you said it sounds wet? What does that even mean? Or it could just be wet. Or Fjord could be dicking around with his cheek trick. Yes, yes, yes! Good idea. Don't fuck me, Gil. You got this. You don't got this. I do. I do. And it's even a little bit yellow. You should probably paint a dick on it. I mean, you could tag the whole place. Yes! It's a speakeasy. But it's like a pray-easy. You could be the bouncer. Nice. They? They? He? It? MATT and We all took feats that make us immune to surprise, right? What's wrong with you? Why am I rolling these weird dice today? This is a great map! They look like stalagmites! No, I was hanging out with Beau. Wherever Beau is. Yeah, sure. That's not 25 to 20. 12 for me as well. It's going to be easy. Painting. What? Did we see these attacks fail? They don't move fast, but-- oops. No, you're going to die. Oh, okay, they don't hurt. I don't think so. What, me? Miss. Hit. There's no save against this grapple? It was a great game. Painting dicks? I lose all the close men in my life! She punched and it does nothing? Wait, they can do that even though they're stunned? Five times?! I will not try to leave the grapple. Instead, I will fire a crossbow bolt at this one that has me grappled. With advantage, because it's stunned? Oh, not good. Both of them not good. 15. Bonus action, fire again. 28. Yeah! Oh, there's a couple ones. Okay, 22. Plus I'll do Fury of the Small; that's another eight. That's 30 points of damage. Good, good. That's all I've got. Banishment?! What! Okay, let's go. Do we need to loot the bodies? Ropers. What's that? A tongue? Yeah, I'll take that. To my belly. This is not the right way. But if we go back the thing will be back. I'll shoot an arrow. 28. 12 points of bolt damage. Oh no, it's getting closer. I back up a little. Another five feet. I'm going to carefully aim and fire a gun at it. My pistol. It is disadvantage because it's longer than 30 feet away, right? So it would be not great. 13. Reload! You're going to make it live?! You were eaten by it. I think they were a couple. I think they were married. Beau, did you get hurt? What are you doing over there? Well, we only have about another two weeks of walking before we get to Xhorhas. Unless you make us a wagon with paint and also horses. And pavement. What about bicycles? You could paint eight bicycles. It's a weird dream I had. Do one of you magic-y people have some way of, next time we see a monster, instead of killing it, we could command it to carry us, or something? Next time. On we go. Out of the tunnels? Why'd you say "shit"? What's going on? Okay, well, we'll come up with another plan. You guys are smart. Let's go to sleep so we can start early in the morning. Barf. Shut up. No. What is that? What's the "oh no"? What is that? That's even worse than "oh shit." What is that? Is he okay? Like I can't breathe? I can't live anymore? Yes, I know. We'll find him. You've experienced the same thing; you've drowned? Oh, that's right. Well, you didn't know. How would you have known? No, it's all right. I'm sorry that I wasn't more helpful in that earlier fight when I panicked and didn't go in the water. But it's not so bad if you're down in the water with your friends. Fuck you! (laughter) I assume they've been making food for us and stuff? It would pass the time. It's like listening to a podcast when you're driving to work. Oh, just like the path we're on! Around what? Around her waist? Around her buttocks? What? While I'm listening to Beau, I'm going to fold my arms so no one can see the shape of my nipples right now. (laughter) He can't see in the dark. Are the rocks around here dug out, like someone was digging? 28. From above, or from--? He just wanted to play Parcheesi. Sneaking in? So we could go up to get out if we wanted to get out. We can go see the sun for a couple of hours, get some vitamin D, and then come back down. Edible pigeons? No. If we go topside, what are the possible benefits of doing that? We're going to Xhorhas. We could go up and maybe find a horse or something and coax it down here to take us faster. I don't know, if this miner fellow who was eaten alive left a couple of horses tied up there-- Why would you bring them into the mountain? You would leave them tied up on top. The worm's hammer? Caduceus, cast Talk to Objects. Ask the hammer. Who was your owner? If we go up? You said there's a lot of entrances and exits to this place? We know that the cricks have been making many attacks, so maybe this is where they go, this is Grand Central and then they shoot off to different places to attack. I don't either. May I use my cloak? Caleb? 21. Against a tiny little thing. Tongues. "I am your leader!" I'm only a half, really. I'm half. I can also offer you this-- I have a pouch of smoking tobacco. You could smoke this and it will make you forget your troubles. Yes. Jesus. 17. No. Don't eat it. It's for smoking, really. You can eat it. Ugh! All right. They're very small though, so in relation to them it may well be-- You can ask them. Is it cute, or not? If you rescue this thing, could it be cute ever? Trade your dog for it. Just trade Nugget for it. The cat? No, you can't! They're on our tail? Want me to take them out? Or at least-- Disarm them? They both have weapons? "Go to sleep." While they're shouting at each other, I'm going to turn invisible. And I'm going to sneak back there. Back towards them. Am I nearing them? Mm-hmm. I'm going to try to sneak up on the one with the spear. And get close to he or she and grab the spear out of their hand. 20. I'll throw it the opposite direction down the tunnel away from us. Then while he or she is going to get their spear, I'm going to try and grapple the weird one. The one that's all weird and shit. Oh, not advantage. Okay. 19. What?! We were specifically told... Yeah, I am your mommy! Yeah! Deal with it! Open? Ugh. Caduceus, where are you when I need you? Hey, bees. I'm going to-- Oh, you two meaning me and Chris? Ah! Con save? 21. I've got one! You're commanding me too? Don't make mommy (much deeper) mad! (laughter) Who are you? (deeper) What do you want? Spurt?! What? Stick a bunch of what? Run. Your centipault? What does it do? All right. Show us the centipault. Maybe we should set up some sort of target for the young man. He's going to shoot centipedes at you. That's ingenious. 18. Do you know these tunnels at all? Have you explored since the worm came through? What was that? What did you just do? Don't beat your skunk. But you're quiet and you can stealth, right? You snuck up on us very well. Sure. How long do kobolds live? Do you like it down here? Do you want to come with us? There's other places. Yes. There's light and other terrain. We don't know that. We don't know, Xhorhas might love kobolds. That's super duper sad right now. Spurt 30 feet ahead? Yeah. No! My boy! He was my boy! He died as he lived, as a spurt. 23. Is that Dani? Because he's a what?! It's secrets. Do we see into the chamber, across on the other side? It's not a chamber; it's huge, right? I'm terrible at this. Five. What do we do? We can sneak in. We can create a diversion. But then to what end? We're going to run in there and do what? Do we think that the Kryn went through and were allowed to pass? Let's offer them some food. Is that the splatter of dead Spurt? Here lies Spurt. Pugil sticks. Then they know we are here. We could have it there in case we need to retreat. Jester can get across the entire span. I could turn invisible. I could create a diversion. Sure. Or just emerge from the lava. Wait, what about us? What about the rest of us? You're just going to leave us? Focus. Is this a real manticore or is it an image of one? What about Yasha? You can't take Yasha. She's bigger than you. I can run and I'm invisible. Into what? Dragonfly. Are you going to bamf with him? Weren't you going to Dimension Door? How far can you go? That is not across the way. That is just to the other side of the bridge, maybe. Yeah. Do you need me to do anything to make the diversion look even more realistic? Because I could-- Oh, you're huffing literally right now? You got silver paint all over. (laughter) Jester. It was so wonderful having Nugget around. He's going to be fine. This is going to go so good. Mighty Nein, we have to do this for the memory of Spurt. For Spurt! The kobold who was just introduced to us and killed. Doesn't everyone have the creative lead of D&D next to them when they play a game? Invisible! Invisible! I think we should start with the monster. Because if I go out there and trip, the jig is up. Jar of peanut butter? Get ready for a dick. (laughter) Major Image. Visuals and sounds. Perfect plan. Foiled on the first step. Is Invisibility? It's concentration. I can't do anything else. I would say 20. Seven. Oh no, the giant totally sees you. Oh no, it's just us. Oh, that's pretty fast. Your movement's 45? I'll be short 30 feet. No. I'll be short 30 feet. Oh, that's lava. He can't walk in there. Shield charge. To hit? Miss. Polymorph. Probably 15 feet? Cows can--? I mean, they're fast. They have four legs. (singing) What does the cow say? MATT and With what? Does the cow get an attack of cow-portunity? That didn't damage the cow at all, did it? What the fuck? Yeah. Sure, what does that do again? Okay, I will stealthily-- One minute. I will stealthily emerge-- Yes. It's probably been one round now. Correct. I will stealthily make my way to the bridge, around the-- 15. Not great. Oh wait, I also get-- I have the hood, the cloak, but it's all canceled out. Sure. Yeah, I'll just kill them both. I can use an action to dash? Okay. I'll action dash, but not up the bridge. Around the side closest to me. Uh-huh. Sure. Yeah. Sure, that hits. Oh, yeah. I think so. I'll do whatever you call it to halve that. Oh, it doesn't just automatically drop? What kind of check? Ten. Under the bridge. And-- (pained screaming) I'm coming for you, Spurt! And then I will press my body to the bridge and bonus action just hide. Thank jesus! Terrible. This is stealth? 18. Good, that's good. Cast Jesus. I think it worked. Our deceptions are so deceptive. Do not. They haven't found me yet. (screeching) 19. Do I have to make a concentration check? 18. I believe so. I close my eyes and imagine my beautiful husband waiting for me, needing me, and I run across the lava. With my ring of water walking. Not right at the giant. I'll go around in a-- Sure, I'll try to leap on some rocks. Are there chunks in the water? All right. I'll do that. Just a check? Ten. My armor class, as of today, is 18. Yeah. Absolutely. Less. It's nine. Other beautiful book. Chris Perkins, ladies and gentlemen. Book designer. Lead book designer. Did Chris just say that? Sure. If he rolls a one on all of them, I'll be okay. I'm not at full HP. Can I use my whatever it's called-- Uncanny Dodge? It doesn't work. It's an effect. He did say, "I'm within 60 feet of Nott." I mean, I'm dead, so-- I'm unconscious. Oh. Oh great. It's actually pretty close. (screams) (screams) (screams) Am I on fire? Then I will stick my head out through the door and shoot a crossbow bolt at that giant that is stalking my friend Caleb. Not great. 16. I shoot him again. Bonus action. Not great. 17. Okay. That's it. But Talks is going to be on this Tuesday?
