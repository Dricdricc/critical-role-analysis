D&D Beyond has a mobile app, guys, and it is out on beta! You can download it now at the App Store and the Google Play Store-- The Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. And because most-- well not most, but a lot of our audience is located in the United Kingdom, I tailored tonight's D&D Beyond pitch to the British audience. Oi, mates! Have a butcher's and be gobbed by this brand new D&D Beyond mobile app for your dog 'n' bone! I know my onions on this and I ain't all mouth and no trousers! It's a real corker of an app, and you can nick yours on the Apple App Store and blimey, the bloody Google Play Store, too! Are you skint? Tosh! It's free, and that's the dog's bollocks! You don't got to be minted to get sorted. There's nothing bent as a nine bob note about it. You get an ereader with the beta, and character sheets will be added in the future tickety-boo! That's a real phrase that I looked up. So don't faff a dozy fortnight. You'll be right gutted if you do! Oh, sweet fanny adams; don't wag off! Search D&D Beyond at your app store and you'll be jolly good chuffed about it! Oh now I'm knackered and cream crackered so I'm off to Bedfordshire! Pip pip! I didn't know that! I still haven't read it! I need to! These are new T-shirts! Wait, they're not? I want to taste some bratwurst. Some beers. I want some Chicago-style pizza. I, Sam Riegel, want to go back and see Pumat Sol again. But that would not make narrative sense. Bachelorette party. Just Nein. It's a lovely language. We have the same middle name! I'm going to tag along beside her. Hey, do I see any other goblins in this bar? Two. I'm going to assume that I'm okay then. I'll just watch for now. Do you want me go get you a drink and bring it back, or are you okay? I'll just watch for now. You were? Oh, yes, I remember. It's very fascinating, though. She doesn't think I am, but if Caleb says so, then I should go with Caleb. Good luck! Ooh. What do you do, take the best two? What do you do? Okay. I'm pulling out my thin bit of wire and I'm getting ready to cast Message. Folds? You're about to know when I whisper it to you. I point to her and whisper in my bit of copper wire and do a little hand gesture, and say all of that to her. The young one's bluffing! The old one's got a sick hand! He's going to burn you! Burn you good! Did you win? I knew you would. It didn't seem to help very much, though. Should we follow them outside and kill them? We were told that there was Claudia Sheet here. Sheed. Sheedy. Ally Sheedy is here. Charlie Sheen. She's probably the elven woman working at the bar since we were told she works here, right? What the fuck was that? You're not there. She's going to tell everyone. A magic trick? Yes! Yes! Photocopying! It's delightful! Too much. I'll need to be plied with many drinks. How's my penmanship? Out loud. You have to do this with every spell? We're busy here! You won't be able to see anything! What is the "a e" that's one letter? I've just mastered the 'f' that looks like an 's'! Do you need to write a long letter? Okay. I've got you. You going to rob the place there? I think what we should do is take the names and descriptions of all of those people and turn them in to the authorities for 50 gold a person. We could make so much money and be heroes in this town as well! Just like we were in the last! As spies! You left out the -regard part! And you mispronounced your name "Ford" when we all know it's Fjord! Clever! I'll accompany you, just to make sure you don't get killed. 17. I'm specifically looking for stores. On the way, do we pass Packwearer's Provisions or any of the other fine establishments you've told us about? No. Just on the way. Any shops at all, or is it just--? Nothing fun. I'm not stealing anything right now! How do I know which is which? So you're saying steal from grumpy people? Which kind of grumpy is Beau? All right. I want to steal something. I have the itch. It's back. Extreme syphilis! A former doctor?! Sign me up! (laughter) Don't worry, I'm only going for grumpy people today. It was given to me by a wise weirdo. Hey! We did that! That was us! They stole our thunder! Because we're just six? We're disguised! We're hiding in plain sight! I did. I feel very bad about that. We're selling these things? We found it. Why do we need any axes? Do you sell flasks? Let's go. The King's Hall. It would be great if you could both take me! Does she look grumpy? Is she leaving or coming? I will follow her. I'll try to stay 25 feet behind her. 13? Oh! 15. Does she have any bag, purse, visible necklace, pockets, anything pickable? I'm going to cast Mage Hand and try to pick-- well, let's see, can I unbuckle the satchel thing or would it be easier to just get in a pocket? I'll go in a pocket, I guess. You said she had two side pockets, I think? Front of the blouse or a satchel on her side? I'll do the side satchel. Okay. 11. I press up against the wall. It was that one. I follow at a brisker pace. Stealth? 22. I'll get a little closer this time and try for one of the pockets this time. Ooh. 12. I run up to where that happened and pick up the two buttons. (laughter) I come back. I did it! I got these two things. They're very nice and round and shiny. A very grumpy person. She was awful. She scowled at children and slapped an innocent man for no reason. She was evil! I believe it! She was a horrible person. My itch has been scratched. Is there a place I can duck away for a second, or is there a-- I walk away from the building, cast Disguise Self on myself and make myself look exactly like Fjord. I've never done this before. I've only seen people do that, so that's what I'm going to do. Uh-huh. I'm four-foot tall. Howdy. Well, I've never used this spell before, so I just did what you did. (softer) Howdy. I don't know what that is. Okay. Let's do it! What? Personally, I think that we should turn in those devious schemers and get all the gold we can. In the original Zimean-- Yeah, let's just mosey onto the bath, nice, slow, and steady. (pathetically) Hyuck, hyuck. (laughing) (spitting) (western flute trill) Poor Ashley. Wherever she goes, it's body tattoos. (laughter) Why are you following us? And by the way, even though I am totally naked, I still look like-- It's me, the goblin, by the way. Why were you following us? Oh. But don't you have mysterious big person things to do? Did you do them? (whispering) So mysterious. I stole two buttons! They're in my existing clothes. They're in the other room. They're very nice, though. ASHLEY; You're among friends. You don't have to wear any clothes if you don't want. Yeah, I handed all of those bandages to be washed. (laughter) And is our reputation intimidating? Threatening? Yes. It's the number nine. No, it's Nine, the number nine. That's right. I'm not in the water. Nope. Yep. Possibly, yes. No, I'd prefer not to. No, thank you. It's creepy. It's dangerous in there. It can drown a person. I don't know. I haven't tried in a while. No, that sounds terrifying and horrible! I mean, it seems dangerous, though. How do you breathe in there? (coughing) It got in my nose! It wasn't terrible. It's not bad. Do you have a god that you worship? Because we've just been told that's it's bad juju around here. The Dawnfather, the Annoying Mistress? Are you in the clear? We can see your vagina. So we're all comfortable. All right, that'll be nice! How does that go again? (singing) Everybody knows the Ruby of the Sea! TRAVIS and To wash my hair? (bubbling) (gasping) I'll kill you all! I'll kill every motherfucking one! Thank you. I'm less scared, but it's still uncomfortable, and I'd prefer to do it at my own speed, thank you very much. Hold the side, like this? Yes. Do any of us know what the Stormlord is? Where are you from?! (laughter) You've been in the water before, haven't you? He's turning into a fish! Should we take the mission to go kill the big beast? How long has it been? I wrap a towel around myself, and then I'll drop form. You guys coming? We'll just go. Roll for perv. Do you need me? Do you need health potions, because you might die? Do you have one? Okay, good. Excellent. Kylre. What screen are you on? Refreshing! What did you roll? Seven of nine? And Rothschild. Do you know what kind of monster it is? Okay. Have people been killed? Okay! It's a good plan B. Karen and Rothschild. TRAVIS and Kneel before Zod. Oh no. Kill that guy. Mini-fridge. This is his normal look-- I think it's very nice, actually. Where did we get these drinks? (laughter) Nah, we'll be fine. We can go over the wall, around the wall, under the wall-- We will get you porn, Liam. We will get you porn. Yes, you were supposed to say something about giveaways or something. What were you supposed to say?
