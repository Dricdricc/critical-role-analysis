I got a shofar! I'm still saying we should rename the show Crate-ical Role for this month. I'm just saying. Guys, you could watch us open stuff all night. Yeah, Scanlan got some great letters from the fans, and he replied with some award-winning advice. So, check that out tomorrow on geekandsundry.com. You also might hear me try to heal you a couple times. I wouldn't call that person a fan, necessarily. I'm sorry I wrote that. Before we go, I have to inspire everyone with this. (laughter) And look, Ashley's, like, somewhere, I can't even see. No, I made this myself, because I wanted you all to know how passionate I was about tonight. Mm. Tastes like strawberries. And sweat. No, my pants are just jeans. All the way, baby. Yeah, I just penciled it in. 21. However, for the second slash, I'm going to use Cutting Words to reduce the damage. I step forward closer to him and I use Cutting Words. And I shout, oi, Kevdak! I have a message from the people of Westruun! And I moon him. (laughter) Ten, right? Pff. One. Yes, it is. Okay. From my crouched, butt-out position, whilst holding my Hand Cone of Clarity. It's shoved up there. Before I make this attack, when I scanned around, did I see any of his allies without any weapons or carrying a staff or something like that? But they're surprised anyway. Okay. Okay. Well, then, I will cast Hold Person at level three on Kevdak. Yes. At level three, so I get to target one other individual. And I would target the beardy guy with the staff. Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage. Because of Cutting Words. No. He's just paralyzed. You can have at him. And can I still move and do other things? Okay, wait. I still get my move, right? Okay. Is there any cover? Are there chimneys? Is there anything I can duck behind? And still maintain sight? Oh, wait, no, I'd be more than 60 feet away. Okay. Then I'll duck back behind some cover. And as my bonus, I still get a bonus, I will inspire Grog and I'll say, Grog! Now it's your turn to fuck shit up. (laughter) Yeah, that's it. Round globes of victory! I love it. Okay, do your thing, do your thing. Holding your turn loses your bonus action. Yes! Lots of rules tonight, guys. Upper-level rules. This is like 127 Hours, except with a gun. Except she's not attacking him. Yeah, Pike! A beartrap! Multiply by two. Oh my god. Hey, that's good! They're coming for you, Pike. You got a reaction or something? Yeah. You're dead. Do you have a reaction of some sort? Do you have a reaction? Oh my god, she's going to die. Love of my life. She knows what her reactions are. You do have one. Oh my god. You do have inspiration. Yeah, oh. C'mon, Groggy. You got to make a save to get outta the way. With inspiration. They're raging? They're raging. Go back and look at the videotape. This board is incredible. Six more attacks! Everybody's rolling high tonight. Except us. Gloves of Missile Snaring! 20. (yelling) I mean, my spell DC's 18, but with the Hand Cone of Clarity, okay. Just making sure. Okay. I, while maintaining concentration I can still use the wand to do things, yeah? So I'll use three charges of the Wand of Fireballs. I'm aiming a Fireball right around there. Oh yes, I guess I have to move forward to attack. Can I get a radius that includes Kevdak and these guys over here? But not Pike. And hopefully not Grog if my aim is true. Okay. Okay. Three charges is 10d6. 34. DC's 15, I wrote it down. DC 15. There's flaming spikes on the field! I'm going to try to do the Pike move and jump down one level. Oh, Jesus. Okay, okay. 14-- 19! Okay. And I will, with the bonus, I will heal Grog with a Healing Word. Oh. 60 feet for Healing Word, I believe. Right? Okay, well then I will heal Pike, is that okay? Okay, I'll do that. I'll peek over the side and say, (singing) Never going to fuck you up, never going to let you down, never going to run around and not heal you. (laughter) Yeah, seven points! Does another smaller doll hand come out to replace it? Dullshooter. Jump down the chimney, deliver presents. Help Pike! Door. Isn't this exciting? We're fighting a horde of goliaths! She's doing math, give her a second. (nerdy voice) Oh, the weapon's within five feet. Wow. Wow. Is it that thing where you die? You still alive there? You know what? Fuck it. I'll Counterspell that. It's not concentration, right, Counterspell? So what do I do, just a d20? 17. It's dispelled? Oh, shoot. The benches we're sitting on are covered in so much ass sweat right now. Who dat? Who's up there? What's going on right there? Hey wait, well, that's where I am, I don't want him to come up there! (belches) Pardon me. Was that out loud? Now he has seven people attacking him. Only you can protect her. What, they just approached me, they didn't attack me? No, he's attacking me. That misses. That just hits. (laughter) 15-- plus anything? Ooh. Plus two. 17. I got 15 extra hit points. Doubled. Halved. Oh god. So much bloodshed. All we got to do is get Kevdak and they're fucking lost. Yeah, that's a point, that's a point made. You know who could get them, who's fast and strong? Trinket. You really... blew it. Oh, she's winded, that's nice, that's nice. Miss. Hit. Hit. Hit. I am not wearing some things. Yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah, that. Roll and add two, or? Oh. 19. 19. Yep. 17. This has been a long fight, guys. Hit. Hit. Yeah, 20. Six. With his beak. Because he moves. Does Pike get an attack of opportunity? Pike, how you doing? Kevdak or Pike? They are, I don't care about them, I just care about Kevdak. All right. I don't think I'll be able to do a Fireball without hitting either Kiki or that innocent. All right. I'll do the same thing, then. Shit. Yep. The Wand of Fireballs again. I have seven charges, I've used three, I'll use three more. Yes, Kevdak is the center square. Would it hit that innocent? Okay. Angle it a little over towards Kiki so it doesn't hit the innocent? Oh, would it hit Vax that way? Okay, I'll kill the innocent. I'll kill the innocent. I said it already, it's too late. Okay. Yes. Do I just roll? 10d8. Six. Six, yes. 42. Ten? He made his save. (belches) Pardon me. Ah, Jesus. These guys are unkillable. Hey, we killed something, guys! Even though I can't see her-- Sorry. Even though I can't see her, I'm so connected to her, can I try to heal Pike with a big shout? Okay. I don't know if I want to move, this guy is on me. He's going to take a whack at me. Okay. I'll circle. I don't know, I can't even really see where I am, but. Yeah. You have some plan or something, right? My healing is barely anything. So I'll inspire you instead, I think. I sing, (singing) Well then I saw her mace, now I'm a believer, without a trace, of blood in her hair. I'm in love. (singing) I'm a believer. God dammit, he's going to heal fucking Kevdak. It's a new round. Yeah, I'll counterspell that too. I'm counterspelling. Can I cast it at a higher level? Do I know what this spell is? Fifth level. It was a three. But I get advantage. Because I'm wearing this. Kill Kevdak. Oh my god. You're not fast, you're not a fast person! That's not bad. And I did ten, so we're almost back to where we were. You know, it's this kind of intense fun that you can get in every Loot Crate. (laughter) Every month, you'll be on pins and needles to see what's in this box. Jesus. Well see, those peasants would've died anyway, it's not me, it's her, she did it. They're all baddies. And you're doing an "S", which is cool. Oh, some of those are good. He's back to where he was before the Heal. Wait, somebody died? Oh, thank god. Can you use your bonus action to heal? Well, kill Kevdak, then. Spell DC. Heal thyself! Oh, so it can only catch up to him. Tumbling! Oh, you do have inspiration! And you'll need it, it looks like. With advantage. With triple disadvantage. Oh, he's going to the book for this. For a somersault! It's okay, let the DM DM. Chapter three Somersaults. Oh wow, that's good. You need to heal yourself, dude. That's how they all feel when we attack. Eight total? Are you okay? Do you want us to do something? He's a little weasel, he's a little weasel. Aren't you at death's door? He's going to die. Wait, are you dead, Grog? LAURA and He's surrounded by baddies. You know, in your broom chapter. It's all ones and twenties. We have these two-sided dice. Just a one and a 20. I'm pretty far. I'm going to jump down off the roof and move towards Grog. Oh. Stealth check. 13. 19. Move 15 feet? Okay. I will, can I, I can't take her hand and walk too, she can't move right now. Okay, well I'm going to continue to walk. Okay, I'll do that. I'll take her with me. I'm going to use Healing Word, oh shit, what just happened? Okay. I'm going to use Healing Word on Grog, and I'm just going to start chanting, Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Communicate that as a Healing Word. Me? Heal is eight points. What's that do? And then persuasion check? Well, I mean, come on. That's 23. No, I have an action still. So I will cast Bigby's Hand and lift Grog up 30 feet like a fucking god. (laughter) Oh, I had to cast that at level six, by the way. You know what, because he's the god and the hand is subservient, it's the back of the hand like this. It's a dainty lift. (laughter) Pinkie's up. Tea-time. Does he have an actual name or is that just his name? Oh, great. I swoop him down. Do you want to be on the ground or just above it? On the ground. But I release him and I make a fist that clenches right next to him. Just in case anything goes bad. We're going to have to get these dice calibrated later. Oh, you got it? I point Bigby's Hand like he was too. (laughter) I mean, we have a busy day tomorrow already, I don't know if we should add dragons to it. Just say yes, we can always leave in the dead of night. I'm going to go over-- are there any remains of the little boy? Do you have anything that can heal the little boy or bring him back somehow, Pike? Key? Anything? Resurrect him or something? Performance. It's me. I'm off here in the corner. (sings scat) What time of day is it now? We have Pike's dad to find, we've got a house to loot-- What's our thing? Do we want to achieve anything else tonight or just rest? Oh yeah, appearing tomorrow. Action surge? What does that do? Did he ever get to attack? Pike almost died, Grog died. No, there's no way. Oh yeah, we should flash up the Loot Crate link and we'll be tweeting that out later. So that's five w's? That was an amazing battlefield.
