For this week's D&D Beyond spot, I wrote a hilarious skit for me and Ashley to perform together, but she's not here. Instead, I'm going to soldier on without her in the spirit of showmanship. Hey Ashley, guess what I'm thinking right now? (silence) Aasimar, I hardly knew her! It would be way better if she were here. Hey, I've got one. How many tortles does it take to screw in a lightbulb? (silence) Boy, I hope they wrote that one down. Also, any legendary bundle owners who purchased prior to Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes can apply the same code to the new book. Ashley, Mordenkainen Am I pronouncing that right? (silence) And, as always, the motto of D&D Beyond is? (silence) Ashley's parts filled in the gaps. I do. What? They only printed three. One small, one medium, one large. What's his name? Or just go to sleep. It seems like it's too much work. Also, was there anything special about the room? Just a bed? No treats or anything? Magic. A soul asylum? That could've been a cool name, though. That's a conversation? They really are rat balloons. Does that happen? Does that happen? I knew I didn't like the water. Downstairs. I just came to borrow some butter. I was making something in my room. Did they say they had more jobs for us to do? Where is the meeting? Do we have a plan for how we're going to-- what if they're taking you downstairs to ritually sacrifice you, or something? We're all going? Oh, so I'm going in to the belly of the beast? Sure. I'll disguise myself! I'll be just like Fjord. They'll think it's Fjord down there! That's the first time I've ever done that spell. I was very impressed with myself. See, that's too many options, when you can appear to look like anything! I need to focus! If I get lost in thinking, "What nose should I have? Bulbous, pointy, or patrician nose?" That could take hours to decide! So a patrician nose? What kind of eyes? What color? Blue, black, brown, green? A patch on one eye? What else do I have? Red hair, green eyes, big patrician nose, cleft chin-- All right. I feel like you're describing a specific person. I'll think about that one. You seem normal. All of us. Sure! He didn't mean it like that. Sometimes he's very honest with people. Sure. Yes. Sure. To the fancy place? I'm coming with you, Fjord. Unless you want to go with your protégé there. Is it open? Yes, it's nice to see you again, Mr. Sol. Well, I'll let Fjord finish. But I have a request as well. Don't worry. Knowledgeable, too, about all sorts of things. Ah, yes. You sold my friend a haversack before, and it has these side pouches. Can you sell me a pouch, a little side pouch, just a little side pouchy thing? Drink cozy sort of a thing. Other haversacks? How much were they, again? Oh. I'm okay, then. That's fine. I don't need-- I thought that they could be broken up and sold in little sets. How much would that endeavor cost me? Yeah, but I'd just get the side pouch. I wouldn't get the full thing. A lot of buttons. That's true. I'll think on it. Can I ask you one more question, Pumat? I don't mean to pry into your personal existence, but there seems to be many of you. Was that caused by magic? Did you do that? Is that an accident? Was that a splicing thing? So the Cerberus Assembly is that powerful with magic? Oh. That's fascinating. If someone were to want someone with that sort of magical power, you could not provide that, but the Cerberus Assembly could? That's amazing. Are they a secretive group? Do they have a business card or anything? Thank you. Thank you for the information. What if we kill all of Pumat Sol and come back and rob this place? You should be tracking it in your D&D Beyond currency counter. I added my 100. We each got 100. Probably, you made me laugh. Wound closure? You cut yourself all the time, that would be very useful. Yes. We'll probably be back in like a day. Goodbye, Pumats Sol. A bakery and a porn shop? If they find a fight club, you guys are going to be orgasming! (laughter) There's a guy in an Abraham Lincoln costume, just whacking it. (laughter) Courting of the Crick. Paper bag. (laughter) You learn from the best. Jesus! (loud whispering) Do you want to drop off that key first? Oh okay. Yeah. I am the Traveler. (gnawing) What? (swallowing) Mm-hmm. Can I pick that lock? Keep a lookout. (tink) One. It's magically enchanted. It's magically-- Ah! My eyes! Ah! It's magically enchanted! Are my thieves' tools broken? Give them to me! Better. What do I add? 21. These tools are so much better than mine. Can I hang on to them for-- You can have mine. Actually you can't, I'd like to keep them. Sure. He said disadvantage. Yeah, I'm going to search around for valuable shit. 23. Connected to each other? Is it a human size skeleton? (stuttering) Dead guy. Dead guy. This was some sort of a dungeon. Can I tell how it died? Not good. Five. Died of a broken heart. No clothes? Okay. Nothing to see. Do you want to establish some sort of, like, if you get in trouble is there a way to alert us? If I'm with you, I can cast Message and alert our friends. Oh, well then I'll stay out and I'll Message you when-- I can Message any of you. High action. You guys want to go anywhere? Pumat told me that the Hall of Erudition is really cool and has some cool things in it if we wanted to check it out. Or! We could go kill The Gentleman! I don't know, is that what we're supposed to do? Kill The Gentleman? Kill him! Well, we could introduce ourselves and then kill him! All right. Ooh! Who's going down? (laughing) Just listen! Just listen! Are you guys still up top? Okay, I'm going to go over to Fjord and say You said that one of the members of their group is named Dolan? If it comes up, no big, could you find out that guy's last name? Yeah. I know a guy named Dolan Taverski. I don't really know, Taverski. I don't know. I've heard it. Just find out his last name! No, just have something of his. No, nope, would not know me. Natural 20. I'll be up here. If I see anything suspicious, I'm going to Message you. Don't worry, I'll keep an eye out. I'll be in disguise. I'm going to cast Disguise Self on myself, turning myself into a halfling with red hair, green eyes, a hawkish nose, overalls, thinning on top, too-big shoes. Yeah? Call me a code name. Tton. Yes. I'm going to go outside and stand at the front door. No, you're supposed to stay inside. If I see anyone coming, you distract them. I will tell you with my Message spell. I don't know. I don't use it a lot. I think I can do it twice. I can do it twice. "Shut up." The "SAS." (whispers) "Asshole gladiators." 17. Everything's okay! You can reply to this message. I can't reply. Six seconds. Yes! You can reply to this message! Hello, strangers! I'm just a traveling halfling! Yeah, I'm just a random person. All right, all right. How did it go? Want me to follow them? I'm going! Oh, thank you! Thanks. Stealth role? Okay, not good. Worse. 18. Do I know any of their names? The two humans. Are they traveling together? Sure. Nine. This is a man? Okay. It's a single level house? Nothing fancy about it? Any papers? Any weapons visible? Okay. All right. I guess that's all I can glean from this. I'll knock on the door, and then run away before they can see. Oh interesting. I'll go back and report to my friends. And that's what I saw, Caleb, and the others of you who are not my friends, I'll also tell. Just kidding guys, I love you. This is who I am now. I'm sure it's run out by now. We could find out how the High-Richter treats people by posing as people in need. As clowns? Yeah! Yeah! It's 100 in the morning. Yes. 12 or something? Right? Where is it? Ten. (sultrily) I brought my tusk. I feel the urge to go sneak into a room. It's not even locked? Oh, well, I'll push it open and look inside. What do I see? I mean, what is this? What is this roll? Okay, good. SAM and Seven. Why would this even be here? And a flask on top? Wow! Do I see Fjord's belongings over near his bed? I'm going over there. I draw my hand crossbow! Are you an imposter?! I would never do that to a friend! I was hungry. There's a definite explanation for this. Seafood. You must have some on you; you're of the sea. I love shrimp, and I never get a chance to get any, we're so landlocked in here. I love the taste of the sea! I was not looking for shrimp. (laughter) Oh! What is that? What does that do? What is that? Wisdom? Ten. What does that mean? I was looking for your letter to the Soltryce Academy. (whispering) I want it. I want to give it to Caleb. What you would do with it. Study, learn magic, become more powerful. I don't know a lot about magic, but I know he has the potential to be very powerful. And I need him to be. So he can save me. (sighs) So much. So much. But mainly, there's a lot of dangers in the world, and a lot of dangers for me, and especially the closer we get to the north? I think? They don't like me up there. He can protect me. No. No, you can't. Maybe. Yes, there's a few people that I'm worried about, but no one specific where we're going. I know that people are always trying to get me, and (stammering) I wish-- I need his magic to be there for me when I need safety. I need him. I need him to live. No, you're cool for some reason right now. So cool. Will you give me the letter? I could change your name on it to his name, and then he could use it to get into the school, and he could learn more powerful magic and then he could change me. He could change this. But you're pretty handsome for a half-monster thing. (whispering) I think Jester likes you. Yeah. What? What did you use to be? Still a monster thing, though. Oh. Just a less handsome one. Were you a fat kid? Do you have any pictures or--? (laughter) Did you ever have braces or anything? Will you promise to keep Caleb alive? All right. Can I ask you one favor? All right. Never mind. I reach for the flask. Fuck! (laughter) Acrobatics check? 12. Do you trust Fjord and Molly? Me neither. Are we a book club now? Yeah, morning. Not exactly. Which is this one? All right! (laughter) Oh wait, no, but we're seeking help of the Richter. Okay, that's fine. Upper middle class? Lower middle class? We're a family that is down on our luck, because--? What's our cover story? What's the ruse here? We need help from the government because bandits have taken over our house? Oh! We know things, why don't we pose as like Trostenwald brewers or something and our brew shipment-- I'm spitballing-- got stolen by someone and we need help to get it back! Stolen by someone in the government? What are we forging? We could be the Baumbauchs. The Baumbauchs stole our stuff? Do we even know the Baumbauchs are here? Why would we be claiming something here? We need to be claiming from a family that's here. Oh, I'm doing something? What are we doing? Okay, then I'll pick it! What am I doing? Seven. No, nine. Break it! 22. We need to disguise ourselves. Then we go up there and then find out where the Richter lives and then pitch our really ill-thought out plan to them. This is going to be great. Disguise Self. Same exact thing as Fjord, except longer hair, shorter mustache. Yeah, everything. Shorter, but female, just a little outline for the mustache. We're a normal family! I don't know, you tell me. Want me to go talk to him? Thank you, honey. Okay. There's a fierce wind, I've got to--! Oh no! I'm in a box! Oh no! The box is getting smaller! Don't worry, I'll climb out! I'm not an idiot! (laughter) We're just going to walk up and ask for-- Should we leave anyone out to be ready to help if anything goes wrong? I don't know. Caleb, what do you think? Maybe. It's just a fucking name, pick anything! Sorry. (laughter) Yes, I do. I had a terrible night last night. What about the cat? How will we know what's going on inside? Did, they-- oh. Hi, honey! Did she offer to kill a bunch of innocents or anything? Okay, devil's advocate, here I really don't like dogs either. Yeah, they make great food. When you're out in the woods and that's all that you have to eat, they have very tender meat! And, to be fair, (whispering) Mollymauk is a little bit of, I mean, I wouldn't trust him either. Well, that would make her the same as 95 percent of people in this city. Okay, that's true. We don't have watches. Nice! You've met with them before, right? So you could go over. Let's go join them. Caleb? This job doesn't involve monsters. That's pretty good. If Caleb's in, I'm in. Yasha? Should we order up some puppies to celebrate? Just kidding. Me neither. Get drunk? Okay. Yeah. There's so much build up.
