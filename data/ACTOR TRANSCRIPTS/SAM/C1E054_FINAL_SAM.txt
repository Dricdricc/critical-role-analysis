Shut up, Taliesin. Jesus. (laughter) Don't worry. You're not an audio professional. I'm wearing some of the stuff from the crate right now. I think I play a synth. And there you go. Good plug. Nothing's happening. Nothing's happening. (laughter) Taliesin, do something! We have so many things that we need to do! We need supplies. We need to parlay with our allies. We need lots of chains. For that we'll need some bindings of some sort chains, hooks, spikes. Is this about Kaylie? Because I'm still worried about her. But I don't think that we should discuss her right now. We have other things! Why are you harping on this? She's my daughter. (laughter) Okay. Yes. We could use it in some way. Well, what has he eaten? Because it could be nasty in there! Of course I could melt in there! I'm a little man and he's got acid on him! Listen. If there's a man invented who can go to where shit is made and make some really good shit, that's me. So let's pursue this. As a plan B. Is this about Kaylie again? Okay. Yes. You're saying that, a sullen loner who is confiding in one of his closest friends while holding him on the shoulders. This you never had before. I'm glad to be with you. Six points of damage. (laughter) All right, so I'm going to go talk to Vex. An expert in dragons I hope? And ask her how dragons work, how their bodies work. Where they're vulnerable, where they make the acid, where they have lungs, where they have stomachs, how many stomachs? Are they like a cow with eight stomachs or something? So if I miss, end up in that gland, that would be not good. Also. Vex. Vex'ahlia. Thank you. Your brother tells me that you have some sort of acid-resistant something. Is that your primary armor? How would you feel about me asking you to take it off? Doing a little unbuckling and giving it to me instead? We could swap armor. I have a pretty broad chest. These are pecs. I have cold snap leather armor. Cold resistant. Maybe the dragon will throw snowballs at you. Plus two on top of the armor, so it's four. Can we do that? Well, ladies first! Shall we make it interesting and play a little poker? All right. I very slowly and sultrily unbuckle my armor, let one strap fall, let the other strap fall, just do a little shimmy and let it fall to the ground, sort of like The Crying Game. Just sort of, camera pans up a little bit and it's just, there's nothing underneath, it's just me and the cube. And I cry a little. (laughter) Go with what your body tells you to do. How are you going to take off your armor? Oh, really? Well. What does mine look like? Oh, these are like C-cups up here. (laughter) Oh! They went down. All right. I feel good about this. Now we'll continue our dragon lesson I suppose. Well, I think we all are, you know. He breathes acid. Yeah, so we could get hit! Now I'm more protected than you are! I'm very charming. We're all planning on doing something, and I don't think that my part of the plan is any stupider than yours will be. So. Good luck to you. I'll keep your armor safe. Hopefully we can trade back. And if not, you can peel it off my dead body. Pillow fight! (laughter) Whatever your name is. I wrote it down. Maybe he never told us her name. Scottish. (laughter) I'm trying, I'm trying! He's not. Can we? Um, Grog, I can come with you, Grog, if you need some help. Excellent description, I'm on my way. Noja, were there any hidden compartments or secret safes where you kept the good stuff? 16. Oh, he'll just tell us, I assume. Sir, we're about to embark on a deadly adventure to try to clear this town so that you can once again live here safely. Might we trouble you to borrow these potions if they can be in some way helpful to us? Do you know what they are? Oh, I could be small! Oh, wait. Thank you so, so much. So teeny-tiny. No no no. This is most helpful. Do you know anywhere also around here where we might pick up some chains, hooks, spears, javelins? All right. Oh no, this is so helpful, thank you, let me go get those. Oh, oi, oi, I was just-- I'm enthralled by these potions, they're fantastic, and I'm enthralled and so happy that we met you again and all that. I totally remembered who you were. (laughter) Should you get-- should we tell him to get out of the city or fight with us? We aim to finish the dragon, maybe even tomorrow, and make Westruun free once again. Would you have any interest in aiding us in this fight, or are you past the point of putting up a brave battle? I thought you had him. I was watching you, you have disgusting black feet. You walk around barefoot, you're disgusting. 22. Do you have any healing potions or anything, or I mean, I'm sorry, healing spells? I'm familiar with that. All right, well, we'll get some rest, try to put the pieces of your place back together. Good night. Oh. All right. God dammit. Yes? It might have destroyed the house. She's the ranger. Oh, shit. No one can help him on these things? It's okay, we'll do it during the break. You're not there. Matt's checking his e-mail. Specific. We have to cover this up. I'm going to go to Keyleth and ask if I can borrow the rod of immovable rodness. How big is it? Got it. Button on the side? Cool. I love it. It's random, guys. Well if it's like a mousetrap, can't he lie in between it? Taliesin, how does it work? Can I aid her in this bit of camouflage? Can I inspire her? (singing) R-r-ranger, turn and face the strange! R-r-ranger, looks like you're going to have to hide this shit! Time may save me, but I hope you-- also do-- (laughter) We'd have to chop off your head. What if he bites and kills you? Nope. Nope. Wow, that's a powerful look. Where are we hiding? You know, that box of trees that you have. In your mind, so many things-- Heroes' Feast. Aloha. This is a tough decision. But you know, it's not a tough decision to subscribe to Loot Crate. I gave the Potion of Haste to Grog. We both found these two potions. Grog has the Potion of Haste if anyone else desperately needs it, and I certainly don't need to be any smaller, so I've given the potion of reduction? Reducement? Diminution? To good old Vax here. You don't know. Give it to Vex. We were born to do this! You're going to lose your beard! Let's have a feast! Let's have a feast! Isn't there a central place that we killed Kevdak at? Whatever that place is called. You're going to do two feasts? Does the Heroes' Feast give us additional hit points? At dawn! You'll lose it when we wake up. I just want to make sure that we're going around, passing out all the chains, attaching little hooks and jabby things and grappling hooks. If the trigger for that, they're going to be underground-- If they hear a big clank, that's go. Will they know that that's a big clank? Don't worry. His work is done. He made his trap good. Let's do this. Does it last for a while? It's nine. No, we've been up since dawn. Well, we're moving now. It'll be fine. I don't want to go underground. We're going to go up in a tree. Let's go 200 feet away. What's that do? I don't need it. I'm okay. I know that you're very worried about me because of our love, but-- I don't need it. It jinxes me. Different tree? I don't think we should all be in the same tree, guys. Matt, we're more than 150 feet away, yes? LAURA and I would like to be more than 150-- Why don't you do it on yourself? Keyleth, can you help me? I'm going to need help. I know a little bit about dragons. I don't know a ton. Can you help my knowledge of animals in any way, shape, or form? For some sort of a check, I don't know. I just want to make sure that I know everything I can know in the moment when checked. Never mind. I'm fine. Zanror. Pike, you're in the middle of it? Oh, shit. It's not you, Liam, it's me. Not good. Liam, yours doesn't matter. Mine does. No. It's okay, we got this. Pike's going to win the fight for us. It doesn't matter, Liam. The feast gives us advantage on all initiative checks, right? It's a fight. Good, we need that. Big five. Of course, he's a dragon! This is it! She's going to one-shot the dragon. Matt, can I turn around and see Keyleth and Vax making out in the tree behind me? Man, what if this was all a trick and they actually work for him? Oh god, we're all going to die. It was all a trick! They work for him. They're going to kill us all! Shh, don't distract him, he's adding. No, it's buried in the stone. If that's what we planned, sure. Intelligence of three. (laughs) What was that face? That's 8d6. Can I use Cutting Words on the attack or to reduce the attack? I would like to. No, I mean to, I'm sorry, I can't reduce the-- The attack. Okay. (slide-whistle) A d10 is this one. Ten. Oi! You're so ugly you entered an ugly contest and they said no professionals! (laughter) Is that a save? Meaning Matt is unhappy. And three more dragons. Be beautiful! Be good! Did you add your spell attack bonus? Who has the Fassbender stats? Wisdom disadvantage save. I have Cutting Words-ed him. I think this is the first time I've ever been taller than you. I don't particularly like small people. Yes, I do. I tousle his hair. You're so cute! My turn? No. Okay. Here we go. I turn to my little buddy and I say are you ready for a ride, little man? Before we go, I yell as loud as I can to Pike to inspire her with my bonus action first. Can't hear me, or it won't work? Well then, am I within 60 feet of her? Oh. Then I will sing her some inspiration and I'll sing. (singing) Westruun town a dead-end world, east-end boys and Westruun girls, Westruun girls. (laughter) And then I sort of link arms with good old Vax. Actually, I hug him tight because we've gotta be tight together to do this, and I hold up my hand cone and I cast Dimension Door and I'm going to aim right for the belly of the beast. No, I am not. Just an intelligence check. Okay. Why not? Nope. 12? It's just intelligence, right, there's no other-- Yeah, it's two. Okay, 14, then. Hi, dude. Are we touching at all? It's going great. Yeah, that's all-- I'll use my movement to go-- Awesome. To be trapped in the spleen of a dragon with me? Pike, are you in there? I think a lot of those people will be fine. No, just me and Liam. Both of the eagles just screech in pain as they're entirely ruined. So his middle name is The Hope? And his last name is Devourer? It's hyphenated? Yeah, probably. Oh, jesus. Is it big in there? I can move my arms, though. Okay, that's good. I'm going to get that rod out and click it. Yes. Okay. That's good, that's positive, guys. We're getting somewhere. Is that my movement? Is that my bonus? What is that? Sure. Okay. Well, I guess that's my action and I guess as a bonus action I can't really do anything. (laughs) I can't inspire anyone because I don't think I can hear-- oh! I'm going to use the earring. Shit. Fuck. I'm going to just start screaming and say can you hear me, Vax? Fuck! Did Vax reply? Did he move? The rod supports 8,000 pounds of pressure. I know from my experience going to the pubs with Grog-- I'm fine. How's my lungs? How's my lungs? Am I dying here? While you're screaming? I'm almost out. I'm going to see if I can last one more round in here. Well, as I was saying, I know from my time drinking with Grog that any sort of blow to the stomach will really make you barf pretty easily, so I'm going to set off a Thunderwave at level six and hope that he spits me up. You're done, friend, sorry. Yes. Thunder damage. Yeah, this is totally thought-out. 7d8? So it'll be halved. Okay. 25. Only 12 points. Not vomiting. Does a little come up and he swallows it back down? I don't know, did that make a little air? I can't do much else. Do I have any movement? Even in the water? I'm in a womb-like state. All right. Then I can't really do much. Oh! Shit. No, I would've had to call it earlier. Never mind. I could have done Cutting Words after I cast my spell, but I didn't, so forget it. Shit. I know! This is the best place to be. We're only going to suffocate and be crushed. Our earrings should work. We don't need to talk. Yeah, he's dead! You don't know if it's Vex's. It could be anybody's! Text us your move. One more. (terrified laughter) You want to go, keep going? It could be a long night. Oh, so we'll just skip next week and come back in two weeks. Why don't we skip next week and come back in two weeks to finish? The worst cliffhanger ever. I see a hole that goes to the outside now. How are we going to survive two weeks thinking about this? I know what we'll do! We'll subscribe to Loot Crate and we'll find all sorts of things to keep us-- We'll be able to play with new toys and drink from-- (laughing) We're not doing well.
