I'm either a porn actor or Burt Reynolds. I can't smile. (laughter) My costume is awesome. He made that? What are you talking about? Nope, this is how I imagine myself to be. And as we returned to the tavern, did we see hustle and bustle of people rising up in rebellion, by any chance? Do you think the other two are-- the barrel names so two are Sylas and Delilah. And we know that one of the other two barrel names resides in that place that we found. The countess, what was her name? The doctor? And what's the fourth name? I agree with Vex that we can't leave tonight. The streets are going to be crawling with guards and people looking for us. Is there any sort of way you can close us in and make it look like it's a single-story dwelling? It is? One of us has a nervous habit of ejecting smoke from his rib cage. So the opening to the cellar will be just a dirt floor. Wait, what? And yet you've fashioned your entire life's goal upon this dream. So the day after this dream was when you first developed your Pepperbox? Can I just do a quick insight to see if he's being entirely honest? Well, that didn't work. Much better. 18. Now now, Vax, what are you talking about? We all knew what we were doing when we-- pay attention to me! I'm trying to be serious here. Don't you turn your eyes away from me. Look at me when I'm talking to you. We all knew what we were doing when we went into the house. It was an assassination mission. I don't understand why everyone's harping on how dark it got. We knew we were there to kill everyone in the whole place. No, I disagree. We have to make a strong appearance. This is shock and awe. We're not going to win over the people by half measures and hey, let's hold an election, or something. We have to kill everyone in as dramatic a fashion as possible. No, how disgusting they are, and how disgusting they die. I wouldn't mind a few people being scared of us, too. I don't think I would knock him out. Vex, I've heard a cough like that, and it's probably syphilis. Personal experience, that's all I'm saying. It might behoove us to spend a day or two finding another shelter, and also seeing what our actions have resulted in, and seeing if we can't sway some opinion in our favor, because we're strong, but we're also pretty weak these days, and I wouldn't want to go against the big guns yet until we have the people behind us. Or at least possibly turn one of those giants to our side or something. We need some help. Can't really talk to people that way. Hey, hep cat, yes. I'm wanting to get a beat on the vibe. Yes, I think we need to hear what people are saying. In the privacy of their homes, maybe. Do some snooping. And we need to find another potential safehouse. We should rest. If you fall asleep, is that illusion going to vanish? And in addition to your excellent illusion spell-- That's wonderful to hear. Is there any other means of protection we have? I mean, if they are magic wielders, they might be able to sense our presence or something. Is there any way to obscure that? I guess I'm asking this, but I'm one of the only two magic wielders here, so I should know the answer. It's just a visual, though. I will watch with him. I'll watch with him. Colder than it did last night? Because it also got pretty cold last night. Oh god! So what if the Sun Tree is like-- Yeah. Are we spooning? Oh, we are? No, they can only become bats. I read about this. What, that piece of metal thing? Hey, I made that. I call it a Scanlan. I call everything a Scanlan. And you're a vampire. Oh, and the feast is gone too, isn't it? Initiative? I know it's been brought up to me. I thought it was a hypothetical. Is it true? (chuckles) So I get a plus two. I rolled a 20 initiative, then. Okay, so there's three of these things? Okay, I'm going to use my movement-- can I see them all? I'll use my movement, because I just woke up, to pee. Because I just woke up, I've got to pee. It's midnight wood. I can't move my lips. While I'm peeing, I whip out my Wand of Magic Missiles and I point it, and I use four of the slots for it to shoot... four times three is 12 missiles. Each slot is one Magic Missile spell, which is three missiles. It says so on the wand. "For one charge, you cast the 1st-level spell. You can increase the "spell slot level for each additional charge you spend." So I'm going to use four of them. Which is 4d4 plus four for each one that I hit. This guy is the brains of the operation. Oh, so it doesn't increase it three darts per level. It's one. So if I do a level four, I get two darts for each fucker. 6d4 plus six. Okay, so 2d4 plus two for each guy. I'll do that. Great. And it can't hit my friends or anything, right? I mean, they're Magic Missiles. Do I have to roll this six times or just two? So, three plus two for the first guy. Ten for the second guy. And seven for the third guy. By the way, I'm holding my dick with one hand and the wand with the other. I'm dual wielding. And they're both spraying everywhere. Don't worry, I won't wash my hands. (laughter) Do I get a bonus? Sure, so I'll inspire Grog. (sings) I need Grog to rage and get us through this semi-fucked kind of fight, baby, baby. (laughter) (sings) Kill-kill-kill kill-kill-kill-kill! Take the inspiration back. Did you just say stanky? Except we don't have air conditioning. I would smile right now if I could. (laughter) You're so attractive tonight for some reason. Have we been together? Look at that. And Purim, also. Not a dream. You're doing a reach-around? Okay. My dick is out. Little privacy, please? I instinctively cover my penis. (laughter) It's more important than my eyes. What? Is that true? (singing) Let the sun shine, let the sunshine in. That was so cool. Zip. You got some damage in, no? Yes? That stake was well done. Yeah! (laughter) Soon it will be creeping across my face. Does it talk? I'm up? I'm not ready. I guess I don't need to see it. Can I see it? Okay. Can I do this? I will just taunt it. I will use Vicious Mockery on it, and I'll just say What's up? What's up, toothy? Hey, bite me. That's it. That's all I do. It's 3d4. It's all I got. I wasn't ready. I think it's a wisdom. Because I'm a level 11. Can I do it at an even higher level? Four, two, two. Eight! That's how I want to do it. I want to do some pelvic thrusting while I'm saying it Bite me. Bite me hard. Bite me, motherfucker, bite me! Oh shit, I forgot. Oh, there's urine everywhere. My mustache is falling off; it's terrible. High five! (impact sound) I'm sorry. You're right, I'm sorry. Please don't judge me. It's morning, it's also unseasonably cold in here. That's why it's so small. Don't judge me. So we have not had a full rest? What if they have some sort of psychic communication, and what if this is their spawning ground? What if the Sun Tree is their spawning ground? Wait. Did you grow that mustache for tonight? That's awesome. But the coin said we should go. I still think Clarota was a pretty good guy. All right, sure, let's do that. That's no good, either. What about this? How about we don't sleep in the tunnel? We barricade that up and we just sleep in the cellar. Not the tunnel, the cellar. Can we barricade the cellar somehow? I go back to sleep. I've already watched. Does my thing help me? I have some thing. No, shit. I'll find it. Don't worry, come back to me. What is this? Wisdom? Advantage. 14. Ring of Mind-Shielding, is what I was going to say. I don't know what you're talking about. Whoa, that's so cool. I mean terrible. What about the hit points that were lowered? Did you just say fart the son act? Oh, father and son. Oh! Seeming! Yes. Do we? Do you? Okay. So I am to Seem us as peasants again? (sings) Seeming. Feel me, touch me, heal me. All right, so we're all peasants. I'm a cute little boy with a lazy eye. To match my grandma. Yes. I'd leave that up to Percy. Yeah, we need a code word. I didn't want to disturb your announcements. Easy, Helga. You meant nothing to me. I don't know what you're saying. I can perform perfectly. Is that a thing? Are we doing this? Papa, let's go. Oh, yes. So Vouk is alive? Would I have been smart enough to Seem us slightly differently? Except I gave myself a lazy eye. Well, that's up to them. Thenardier is our precious father. A small electronic device. 80 60? Percival Sanchez Vicario-- Kevin Dorff, Wesley Snipes. What's a movable rod? Did we already have one of those? What happened to it? He put it on the magic carpet? Pa, please! I'm tired. (yelps) Call Child Protective Services! My name is Tad. I'll have one of what he's having, as well. I haven't eaten in three days. What? I have a friend named Kevin. He says there is someone trying to do something about it. He says that that's what caused that fire yesterday, over at that big fancy house. He says there's rebels afoot! Oh, I'm just saying what I overheard. My friend Kevin, he's truthful. When he lies, his papa beats him, so I believe him. He said that someone really strong took out someone who was at that big fancy house that was all aflame the other day. He said that there's lots of them, and that they're going to free us all from this hell we live in! Wait, two rolls? Okay, persuasion and deception, you say. Oh Jesus. Okay, persuasion. 39. (laughter) Deception, 15. Wait, or 29. It's a lot. No, it's 16 plus 13. That's 29. Sorry. It's a lot. The last ones? Three years ago, Papa wouldn't let me out of the closet, so I didn't hear much of what was going on. I'm sorry about my papa. He's had such a hard time these last few years. Our crops are not performing well, and he's under a lot of pressure. And I think Mama doesn't love him anymore. I'm sorry. We can go. What was your name, sir? Thank you, Patrick. I don't know if my papa has enough money for these drinks. From the floor? Come on, Papa. Let's go. I turn around and I take the rest of his drink. (laughter) You do?! Oh, we gathered again. Okay. Oh, nice. When we flew in? Okay. I pull out Sir Kerrion's notebook and I hand it to them and I say, this should be some proof that we mean what we say. Can I drop it on one of us, or do I have to drop it on all of us? All right. I will drop Percy's Seeming. Wait. You know who we are? How does he know? Vedmeyer. Is that the house that the Countess was briefly residing in? Count Tygieri? Tylieri. How are these men, the duke and the count? What do the people think of them? But they're just thugs who were particularly successful. I've got one, too. Kill him. I'm just a small boy, but we've seen mists at night, strange things that come out when the sun goes down. Are those focused around a central area of town, or are those everywhere? Thank you. Unlike her husband? The Vedmeyer estate? The duke's. Okay, yes? All right. Well, he's saying create a distraction. That symbol is not the de Rolo family seal, is it? It's modified. I did it a little in college. It's fun. That's crazy talk. I can probably make a big stink. Please, it's big for me. Oh, those are so cool. Save those for a person. I've got Magic Missiles. I've got all sorts of shit. I can do Stinking Clouds, I can make them see things, I can blow open their doors. I can do it. You guys go have fun. I'll start on the distraction. It's a kill-Trinket arrow. I'll head over to the other house. Show me on the map where it is so I know where I'm going. Your town sucks, weather-wise. I'm the mess? All right. So you'll earphone me when you're in position? Let's go, quickly. We're burning daylight. If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times. I don't need help. They need your magic. And if I die, tell Pike I love her. I might. I'm a little wee man. How far is the gate from the front door? Okay. Any guards? Anything around? And if I walk around back, is there any guards around back? Sure. Because they haven't phoned me to tell me that we're ready to go, I will become a dragonfly and buzz into the dwelling. Ten. Okay. Again, they haven't phoned me, so I'll perch on the handrail or door frame or something just above him and wait. Jeez! You're both discovered and killed. What? All I heard is on the count of three. What's going on? Shouldn't I do mine first? Oh, you want me to do mine first? How about wait 30 seconds and go? All right. I turn into a triceratops. (laughter) Intelligence? I already get advantage for intelligence checks. 19. Three horns and big. d6? I don't even have a d6. (laughs) Wow. 17. And for my move, I bash down the door. d20? 18. Three, six, that wasn't anything. Nine. Okay. But I'm a dinosaur! Scanlan on the floor. Everybody flee; there's a dinosaur. Story Mode!
