I've never been over here before. Everything flushes the other way around. Wow, that's so weird! That's good. Where am I? On my own. Where are they? Where am I? Hello! LAURA and Where have you guys been? What?! Pike? Pike was here? What are you talking about? Why didn't you call me? We have an earring! Well, I-- (sighs) You didn't lead with Pike, though! You should have said, Pike's here. Hey, Pike's here. (frustrated noise) I mean, I was having a fun time, but I would've dropped everything to be with Pike. Don't bury the lede. Pike first. Always Pike first. I wasn't even in a brothel. I walked toward the brothel, but then I bumped into Zahra. Remember Zahra? She invited me over. We talked all night. One thing led to another-- nothing untoward-- but we just had a nice slumber party. It was lovely. It was me and a couple of tieflings. Three, I think. We were doing each other's hair, telling stories, playing songs. It was wonderful! It was great. We had a great PG night. Yeah, except I would have dropped everything to come to see the woman I love, the woman of my dreams, the woman I will marry and bear children with. I don't know if she'll bear mine or I'll bear hers. Gnomes, it's tricky. You never know. Oh, don't get me started. Well, at least we're all together again. Wait, what?! I missed everything. This was a long slumber party. We just kept going and going, and at one point, I was like, okay, I'll see you-- oh, there's another meal? Okay, I'll stick around for another day. And we just kept going. We did. Not my hands. Just my toenails. We braided hair. We connected. Well, at least we're all back. We can get on the flying carpet and go somewhere fun. You have a Bag of Holding? That's really far. That is a good thing. Whoa! The devil? Well, thank you for catching me up, fellows. What's our mission now? What are we doing now? What? I was gone for a day! There's a dragon now? Are you sure about this? Without rules, you would win. Oh, what was your first request? Oh, it's sick? Get me away from it. Damn it, you'll have to come back. There's going to be a street fight! 11,000? I run up. There's a bookie here? I run up to him and very subtly say, I'd like a hundred against Grog, please. (laughter) All right, yes. Just don't mention if I win. Maybe I'll come and collect later. I'll collect later. Don't say anything. He's juicing! How did you have that ready? Put him in a body bag! Oh! Miss. As they're chanting, I'm starting to sing amid the chant. (singing) It's the eye of the goliath, it's the thrill of the fight. Rising up to the challenge of that asshole. (speaking) And I'm trying to send inspiration to him. Oh, wait, so he gets some sort of advantage? If you want to use it. You're sure you're adding that right? It's just plus four? Are you sure? I thought you were both raging. There's no halves! Is that true? So they're not counting the halves? Oh no. He's going to pull some shit. As he does, I shout out from the audience using my Cutting Words. Oh, Kern, do you need some dick? Because I gave some to your mom last night! (laughing and jeering) d10? Fuck! Only three. I said, I see this happening. I go over and I use Friends to cast-- Oh! What is that? I just won 100 gold! Oh my god, it's her tits! It's her tits! She just showed her tits. That's inspiring! Can I sing from the audience? It's all this roll. Yeah, so I was going sing to him to inspire. I guess I can still try. I sing, (singing) with your arms, and your fists, and your legs, and your wrists, it's in your head-- That's all I got. Is he in defense now? He's in dodge, so it's at disadvantage? Just hit him! No. Ow! Well, it was worth it. Grog, before we go deal with our friends, if I may That man fought a brave fight. I feel you should go make amends with him, it was a respectable battle. You won't feel good about yourself unless you do. Yeah, yeah. Just tell him. It's a real place. I'm here to collect my winnings, please. No, I bet on Grog, if you remember correctly. There must be a typo. I bet on Grog. Don't you remember? Nope, I'm just doing this. Nope. Two. Well, wait. What is this, deception or persuasion? What is this? Yeah, it's 15. No, it's not good, no. I've got to work on this. Well, what's the fine? How much was the fine? I'm Burt Reynolds, esquire. I'm an attorney at large. I represent all manner of escaped mental patients. (laughs) 20. If you would like us to fill out the paperwork. I have about two reams of paperwork for you to fill out, to release them to us, as well. And also there will be court costs involved, oh boy, in triplicate. You'll have to get your supervisor to fill out this one, and I will need this one, and I will need this one, as well-- Oh, 500 gold. That's fine. And they'll still get to collect their winnings from the pit? Great, thank you sir. You know what, I can make this paperwork disappear. This is fine. Say that word again? What? Oubliette? You've been bested. (laughs) I think he's having an aneurysm. Thank goodness you are being represented by an Ace Attorney. Well, I mean, come on. You came into a bar looking for young boys. What was I supposed to think? Don't make a habit of it. I lost 100 gold. That fight was amazing. L'chaim! MARISHA and Oh?! Your Wheel of Mending, perhaps? I saw them. I saw them! I will draw them in great detail. She would do anything for you, Grog! Oh, it was for the money! Listen. I would show any part of me for, like, two gold. Here, take a look at my third nipple! It can be wherever I put it, really. It's magical. We're all together. That's what's going on. Well, maybe. There's two more things that I have unanswered questions for. First of all, you said we were going to stop on the way to get a new carpet or to get our carpet repaired? That is a smart idea. That's great. Before we leave though, does anyone have a nagging, tugging feeling about that cloaked human who praised your performance? Should we investigate that at all? Well, that makes something. Could we at least find out who he was before we leave town? Earthbaker Groon? Yes? Yes, Tiberius, my good friend? I'm always satisfied. (laughter) That's how drunk we are! Oh, I think I saw Tiberius fall over. Grog, would you like any young boys to accompany you? (laughter) Huzzah! No, that's the other character. Amazing. Matt's crazy prospector character. Pointless haggle. I love it. Best part of the show. Why don't you just go get arrested again? I'm going to throw a Lightning Bolt spell into my Ioun Stone. Do you need us with you? Good luck. I don't think they-- This is a temple. Oh he has some sort of vow of silence. We should respect it and also make fun of it when he's gone. You kept it together great! Yeah, I couldn't hear much, but it was great. Do you think I should shit somewhere-- Okay, we'll just go, then. Better be safe? No? Okay, we'll just go. Are we going on the airship? Let's find Captain Damon and get back on the ship. I like "siggle." Wait, are you saying that someone out there in the world should do the elven symbol for VM and we should all get literally tattooed? In real life? What about the airship? What about Captain Damon? Captain Damon-- Oh shit, did we leave Trinket? Good job, Tiberius. Do you have a bathroom around here? All right. I might make it. Oh boy. Buttoning up my fly. Final signature? I'll just sign my name. You know what I think? I think you guys hate each other, actually. Don't worry, I shat in the hallway. Is our next destination Kraghammer? Let's take a night and then go set off in the morning. To the keep! TALIESIN and Cordell. Cordell! What is this tent? Is someone inside of it? Well, I'm... Men, too. And you are, young man? No! No, not at all. No. This is not an open membership situation. Vox Machina has been together for many years, and we've forged our bonds of friendship-- Plus whatever. Oh Jesus. It's like a million. Dead! This is why he's single. Wait. Send him on a mission. No, send him on a mission. Mercer's our god. We'll see, if he comes back. Son of a butcher. What am I, chopped liver? Let's leave it at that. You live because I let you live. Just needed to say that out loud. Seeker Emring, you said? Of the council of Tal'Dorei? He's an ally. Could you instruct the security guard-- we can take care of it. We should instruct the security guards if there's a tent outside the keep, they should just burn it down. Let's do it. If you'd like to. I'm feeling a little bit Pike-sick right now. I could concentrate very hard. No, I'd have to describe to you what I see. Of course, I would definitely stop looking if I saw her naked in front of my poo. Definitely. Sure, I'm going to try to scry through my poo. She should fire that person, but okay. (gasps) She was definitely naked. No, she was supervising her crew in a fair, but firm way. She was just being Pike driven, radiant, beautiful, and empowered by the spirit of Sarenrae. She's everything that we think of her and more. She's beautiful and charming. Let's just let it be known that I could kill Tiberius if I wanted to. Just going to say that. Yes. I mean, that's beside the point. Pike was glorious and wonderful and confident, and I miss her so much. I hope from time to time I can look in on her. Well, it's really any bodily fluid, I believe. I could piss. I could barf. She really was, and is. She's not little, but yes. Is it a councilor from Tal'Dorei? We're having bread pudding for dessert. Can we go to Kraghammer in that? Thank you for your information. I could lend you one of my jackets.
