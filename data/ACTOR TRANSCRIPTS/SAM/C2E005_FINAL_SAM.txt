I do. Here, give this to Matt, he'll need it. Our partner this week is once again D&D Beyond, that's dndbeyond.com. The big news is that D&D's newest book, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, is available for pre-order now on the site. If you preorder, you'll get exclusive character portrait frames, sheet backdrops, and themed colors that you can use with upcoming character sheet updates! I don't know what that means but it sounds awesome. The $10 off code "beginnings" can be applied to your preorder. To celebrate, I'm going to personally be giving away one copy of this book to either Travis, Liam, or Marisha, but they have to compete for it. Here's the rules I'm going to give you a race, class, and character description, just like you can do on D&D Beyond, and all you guys have to do is come up with the name of that character. Laura, Taliesin, and Matt will be the judges. Best out of three wins, all right? You just have to come up with a name for this character, ready? A male stout halfling swamp druid who only wears a diaper made out of kelp and loves to Wild Shape into manatees. Liam, what is the name of that character? Marisha, what is the name of that character? And Travis? Judges, who wins? Oh, Travis, easy win for Travis. Remember, these characters can all be made on D&D Beyond. The next one is a male tabaxi bard with an electric guitar who constantly plays K-pop songs and has a runny nose. What is his name? Liam O'Brien. Marisha Ray. Oh yeah, sorry, three names. Yep, okay. Travis? Ooh! Judges. Travis again. One more, this one is worth two points. A female kenku paladin with no arms or legs. Who worships the lobster-headed god Blibdoolpoolp, and it is a real god, and is dragged around by a pack of reindeer. Liam, what is the name of that character? Judges, Liam, Liam, Marisha, Liam gets two points! Travis gets two points! Marisha wins! I will personally buy you one of those books, Marisha, hold me to it. D&D Beyond, everyone, make your character today. Apparently my breath stinks, so if anyone has any gum, I'll take it. Just you, Laura Bailey? Any questions? Like a techie? Oh! That tiefling anatomy is very strange, you know. Which is Frumpkin now? He's gone to the other place. He won't be able to respond. A unicorn would be really cool. We can rob them. Well, we could rob them, or we could go off the road and hide and wait for them to pass. Oh, we don't. Pleasant day! He can't hear you. He can't hear you. He won't be able to talk to you for a while. You see, he's not really there. Nine! Do they look sad. I mean, we have in the past. If we are confident we can get away with it, we would. We could-- There's a lot of people in that caravan though, it seems like a risky maneuver. We could probably get away with it. Why? You want to follow them and rob their shit? I mean, sure. Let's go do it. Oh, okay. No, we were more small-time thieves. We wouldn't typically hijack moving caravans. Usually we'd wait until they parked somewhere and then just go sneak on and steal something out of the back. But if you need me to teach you how to steal, you can tag along sometime. All right. Yes, please. Should leave a guard with the-- And believe. Sounds good. Maybe you shouldn't go. Oh, that's very nice of you. We do. That's very nice of you, thank you. What did I do to deserve this? I'll sit up with you, Jester, and take first watch, 1B. No, it's pretty good. It was violin class! What? What's going on? Why did we leave you on watch? You can't see in the dark! Okay, let me sneak around and look. Right? We don't want to wake everyone because-- What if it's nothing? Then they'll be upset with us. There's nothing more dangerous than-- No, she's the most irritable! Sorry. I'm going to go look! I can see in the dark. I'm going to dart off in a flanking maneuver. 18 plus stuff. 26. Buffalo-type creatures, or buffalo? How far am I from the camp? Cool. I'm going to pull out a piece of copper wire and, remembering the motions that Caleb taught me, I'm going to twirl it around in my hand and hold it up to my mouth and whisper a Message just to Caleb. I'm going to say it's three buffalo, or buffalo-type objects. Creatures. What do you want me to do? (fwoosh) Yes, you can! All right. Yes, I can hear you. It's just one back and forth. I can talk to him, he can reply once. That's it. Is it? Oh, it is! Ooh, this is exciting! I've never had magic before. You don't know! You're drawing hamsters. He said to come back, so I'm coming back. On the way back, I'm going to see if they're eating or sleeping. What are they doing? They could be good for meat. We could go kill them and eat them for meat. You said to do the hand movements and the whispery thing. And I did it and it worked! Yes! Oh, but we could've eaten those buffalo-type creatures. Three large beasts of burden. Wait, we could use them to pull the cart! They went that way! In the dark! I don't know! I don't know what they were, but they looked big and able to pull the cart. You want to go cow-tipping, don't you? What happened? Are we going to go after them or are we going to go back to sleep? Let's go! LAURA and 12. TRAVIS and You'll never know what they were. Sorry. Stop it. Are we supposed to come back? That was fast. You really fought five guys in an alleyway that fast? Oh no, he's injured! Why are you drinking salt water? Oh. (in Sam's voice) Why are you drinking salt water? (laughter) It's the lowest form of humor. Are you all right, Fjord? Were you in the ocean? Did anyone die? We're not going to let you run into the dirt. Should we get back on the road, then? How is Horse doing today? How's Horse? Maybe for short we'll call him W.C. What does it mean? It's a pun. (laughter) Let's do that. Have we seen these things before? I think they're-- well, we don't know what they're called. We just fought them. I don't know what they're called; we fought one before! You just hurt them until they die. Very. Oh. This'll help. Hey side note where's my fucking wine? Is it gone? Oh wow. What a cool map. The enemies are just all over that direction, right? 15. So revealing-- I have an idea. We need to move away from here, right, Fjord? All right, I think I can do something that would make them fire many of their arrows at something, but not us. Should I do that and then as soon as they fire their arrows we can run? Diversions! That's what it's called, it's a diversion. All right, may I move, is that a thing? I take out a bit of fleece, and repeating the words and doing the hand gestures that I've been taught and tracing the image of a creature on the fleece, I will make a Silent Image of the guard who told us 30 gold a gnoll. I'm going to have the image of that guard dash across, slowly, dash across this alleyway. Like that way. Yes, not dash, just walk in a way that he could be easily shot. Okay, great, that long-haired guard individual. Ooh, nice. I cast a spell. Can I also move? As soon as the arrows flew by, I'm going to dash across the alley. Yep. As far as I can go. Look at two unicorns inside? They're inside the--? Oh wait, is this an ability check? Nope. Don't worry, though; I touched all your dice, so they're going to roll great tonight. Six. And Nott. Six. Huh!? (panicked stuttering) I'm going to drink from my flask. N-O-L-L? Beau, bow, Beau, and bow? She's in Patient Defense; she's going to be fine. You're going to be fine. Whoa. Or the guy in front of you. Is that a crownsguard? No, the guy next to him. Oof, what does that mean? 6d6? Nott's going to poke her head into the window where Beau is inside. Beau is within a few feet of a baddie, right? I'm going to shoot the baddie next to Beau. 15. Nine points, that's including sneak attack damage. Plus fury of the small, so 11 points of damage. Ten points of-- wait, what did I say? Nine? 12! Thank you. Movement, I will use to climb up into the second floor window. That's not me. The one next to your right. There you go. That was good, but it's disadvantage. That's better. Athletics. It's a straight ten. (screams) I say This is fine! (laughter) Okay, I'll use a bonus action to get-- Is towards the window less fiery? Sure. It was two threes. Rough. Half cover. I'm done. Hey, look at that, it's me in the window. So your duplicate is somehow less useful than Trinket? Is that what you're saying? (laughter) She may move if you move away from her 30 feet; she may just come with you. Oh shit. But you can leave her out in the open. Hits. No. Super advantage! The grassy gnoll? No, really. Thank you, Sam. How many are engaged with you right now? Hey! You have to save first. Now close out of that. You still have your action, right? I touched one. That's why they rolled so shit. Just a little perspective here. The gnolls pushing away the cart, how many are there? And what are they--? No obvious weak points on the cart or anything? It's going to take my bonus action to do so? Then I will not look at the cart. I'm sure it will, but I don't know if I could kill one in one shot. Instead I will, using my goblin feet claws, just dig in and I'm going to go upside down so I can see into where Beau is and shoot one of the ones next to her. I don't know! The ones next to her? Ugh. Well, I got to hit them. The one that I hit before. That is 17. Cool. I'm going to go pop back up to the top floor, and use my bonus action to hide. Nope. Ten. Into the house? There's a really loud ticking clock in the room with you. I can take a shot at the cart, but what is one arrow going to do? Does he have any disadvantage or anything? He left! No! Okay. (sad trombone) There's two gnolls in front of me that I can see, right? The other one, I will point at and I will remove a tiny rotten tart from my pocket and crumple it onto the floor and take a feather and move it around over the crumbs, and say Hey, what happens to a frog's wagon when it breaks down? It gets toad away! And I will cast Hideous Laughter on the gnoll. 13. The untouched one. Okay. All right, I'll use my bonus action to hide. Oh, I have to stealth. Oh, God damn. Okay, that's 13. That's the one you just hit? How many are over there? Oh, I didn't see it. Hellish Snap. (engine revving) Start up the full. Those guards are killing more than we are. Don't you want to ask that nameless guard how he wants to do this? Is it our turn soon? Caleb and me? I would like to jump down from the wall and run as fast as I can after the leader and the cart. Oh, disadvantage. Jesus. 11. Dash, everything. Oh. This is a saving throw, that's not disadvantage. 16. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god! Oh god! Yeah. But it's a spider sense. Your duplicate can cast spells? What? Don't blow my cover. Okay. What? Hits. Oh, shit. (gasping) Oh my gods! I was just going to follow them from afar. I forgot they had bows and arrows. I thought they wouldn't see me because of the smoke. Oh boy. We don't have those. Feed and Mead? Should we divvy it up equally? The "Rod Bawn"? One? I think he's got two glass eyes.
