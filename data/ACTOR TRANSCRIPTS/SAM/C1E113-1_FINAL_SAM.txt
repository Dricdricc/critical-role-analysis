I played a character named Orc 4, who, among other things, hates humans. Enjoys grog. And is dumb. Oh, I think he hates them? I think he hates most things. No, he just hates. He's a hater. Really, they should spend more of the game talking about his wants and needs, and his ambitions and likes in life, but no. He hates both. Just hates a lot of stuff. Feels like too long. Nice. (raspy voice) Hello. (rasping) Hello. My name is Ur-Eden Goodthink, and I'm the olog you want to see if you're hurt. Because me is a sawbones. I'm an olog, so I'm rather big. But I'm also a sawbones, which means if you have a toothache or something, you come to me, I pull the tooth right out. Probably half of your jaw, too. If you got a broken bone, I pull the arm off. If you got a rash, I pull your skin off. So really, I take care of all your medical needs. Somebody came to me with-- they were having some stress dreams. I ripped their head off. Solved the problem right away! Yeah. Usually most things can be solved without insurance. But yeah, I'm here to help anyone who gets injured, and also to kill some man-filth. Do you want to go with me to kill something? Would that break your boredom? Well, those two fellows having the fist fight, we could go kill one of them. I think it's Rarr versus Oog, over there. You could be right. Yeah, they do. All the uruks do. Hoshgrish? Is that true? Did Sauron really talk to you? Because sometimes I hear voices, but then I turn around and it's just an orc talking to me that I didn't see. Yeah, but I didn't see you. Yeah, that's the problem with these things. You know what he sounds like to me? A medical condition. I should probably get my axe, chop up your head, and see what's in there making that noise. All right. Yes. Let's go get them! Let's go! I pick up my quarterstaff and start stomping towards the tower. That's where good leaders go. I also got a one. I could have used my Deflect Missiles! I'll do that next time! 21. You can call me Eden. All right, I'll pick up my quarterstaff with two hands, and I will hit one of them. (laughs) The one on the left. Hiyah! Ooh, not good. 11! I have a second attack. Ooh, this one is better! 26! All right. 1d8 plus four. I don't know how to do this. Okay, that's eight points of damage. But! Let's do other things, too. I'm going to use my Stunning Strike, right? I'm going to use a ki point. Yes. 14. Okay. The Stunning Strike. So when I hit him, I, knowing my medical knowledge that I have so well, I aim for the one place that I know hurts the most the wang. On you. So I jab him right between the legs. Oh, right in the gronk. Right in the gronk. Sharply hit. Nice and low. Gronk hit! Take that, you glob! I believe so. Oh, wait, a bonus. I don't know how this guy works. Bonus action strike? You can do that? All right, great. I will. If I hit a stunned person, does he become unstunned? No. Oh, no, I'm good. I'm done. Oh. That's crazy! I already took two hits. Can I jab at the guy next to me? All right, sorry, Laura, I'm interfering. Are you the scar artist? I was just jabbing the other guy. I rolled a 23. Another eight points. Such a thinker, this one. 21! Are there any other ways around? Are there ladders? Oh. We're going to beat this guy? I'm ignoring this guy; I'm going to charge into the stairwell. Does he have to roll a negative four? He does not hit me. Sneak attack? Come on, you shugs, come with me up the stairs! Oh, that looks like a problem. I will solve it! I will attack him with my quarterstaff. Ten plus seven, ooh, 17. Yes! So that hit goes for, ooh, 12 points, and you said he looked stronger than the rest? I will use my Flurry of Blows. I would like to flurry! 19 plus seven! That's another nine points of damage. 20, natural 20! One. That's two plus four. So that's six. And then one more. Six plus seven is only a 13. Eight plus four, another 12 points of damage! Like Zorro. He was this glob that I killed two towns over. He would always write a Z on his victims. But my name is Eden? So I'm going to try and write an E. (grunts) Can I make a lowercase E? (roaring) He committed suicide. He said he was so scared of you, Mozuu! Do the uprisers, the rebels, look different? Do they have anything different about them in their eyes? That's where he slumbers. We should probably go in. Persuasion, right? Ur-Grandma? Oh, oh yes, do you need medical attention, my lord? Yes. All right, I grab my healer's kit and I will use my really dirty bandages to wrap him up. I don't really have anything to fasten it with so I hock a loogie on one and then fasten it to the other piece and hope that holds. Oh yes, 1d6 plus nine. 12 points. We follow Barfta-- oh wait, that's you. My name's Ur-Eden. Ur-Eden Goodthink. You can call me Eden. All right. Do you need some healing, then? Some of those aren't eyeballs, by the way. I think we should follow you now! All right, I could heal you right now, or we could use hit dice and take a short rest and that way I would save my ability to heal you later. Oh, you're still here! If we're going to do this for you by the Dark Lord's name, I feel that our group of four should have some sort of group name. Yeah, a callsign or something. Is that something you could hook us up with? Or the Orc Four! The Orc Four! The Forcs! Can we get little patches that say "Get Forc-ed"? Across my back. Let's take on after them. Do I get ki points back? All? Holy moly, I'm so powerful! Wow! Hit dice. It will say right there. No. Shrak is feces. A gronk is a dick. How will we chase after these bad guys? Are we going to ride on something, or should we just walk? Do we need a cart? Are you scared of a carangor? I've killed so many carangor. I haven't either. The scatagorus? All right. Well then, we will go on foot. Right? Is anyone good with animals? TRAVIS and Maybe we should walk. (laughter) I've noticed that one of those eyes is a wolf's eye, and the other is an acorn. Is that going to... Seven. What is it? But the Forcs can take them. Forcs! It's dinner time! (laughs) Thank you, Lady Guinevere. (laughter) Totally black. 17. So there's two close together and two others? And my flurry of blows, can that be used on multiple targets? All right, so I'll run up to the first and quarterstaff attack. Ooh, yeah. 23 to hit. Seven. All right. I will flurry of blows and strike him with my hand. Ew, 11. I'll strike again with my hand. (yelps) Oh, that one's better. 19. Six points of damage. With my hand, right? My bonus-- All right. Well, then I will quarterstaff him in the gut! Oh yeah! 18 plus seven. Ooh! 25. One. So five. Is that a part of the flurry of blows attack, or is that when I bonus attack? Okay. So if I hit someone with a flurry of blows, he must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. All right, Forcs. Appetizer course is over. I don't know how far I can take this metaphor! (laughter) Salad course! Yes. 17. Yes. Mozuu! They have chosen you! Hoping that'll be enough light? It must cast some light. It's a 20 and a one. Does the torso light the torch? I don't know what that means. Maybe we should go? Seems like they keep coming. Maybe we should run? Mozuu, do we have your blessing to flee? I'm leader. You hear that? Bow before me! He's been bowing to me. I'm going to run. Oh. I'm going to run and hope he falls off, like a big bucking bronco. I'll use my step of the wind to go faster and jump really far. Are we leaving? I thought that was the plan! Why? (shouting) Guys, are you coming or what? Guys? I'm 80 feet away, and my darkvision can't see that far, so all I heard was an explosion in the dark, so I drop to my knee, and I say As the only surviving member of the Forcs, I will say a word to thank the great dark lord for choosing me to carry on the mantle of this mission. And I will keep running as fast as I can away. It's like Benji. They fought bravely. They were my friends. They took care of me. Oh! I'm hearing voices again. Two voices. Oh god. Three voices. He speaks in mysterious ways. Oh, well. I'll end it all right here. Oh, hi! Hi. How'd it go? I'm sorry I left, but when he made me leaver-- Leader? Oh. I thought he said "leaver." All right, shall we continue eastward? Which way is that? I'm pretty hurt, too. And you're hurt, as well. Should we take another rest? I can heal us if you want, and we can keep going. All right, gather around. I will need to use all of my healing potential for this. What hurts? I cake some mud onto all of her wounds and heal her 13 points. Well, where do you hurt? What ails you? I will take my hair-- Yes, I have a little bit. I shake off the dandruff, make it into a tea that he drinks, but it's filled with protein. Yeah. That heals 11 points. I keep a little flask of grog. I'll swig that. Can I heal myself a bit? Oh yeah. 11 points. Back up in it.
