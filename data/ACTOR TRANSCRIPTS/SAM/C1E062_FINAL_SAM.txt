Can you hear us? Yes? Are there any potion stores nearby? (laughter) Ooh, 22. Well, then I will take a moment to limber up for the day. Stretch up. Yeah, just stretch up. Active squats. I will say that Vax looks a little weird. No! You are not supposed to trust anything in the Feywild. (laughter) There's only one way to find out. I run up and I kiss her. (laughter) It's her. We could fashion a crude canoe and go down it. Let's walk the half-mile. It's a half-mile! It's a river. And do what? I don't follow. I'll jump on. All right, Grog's got two gnomes on his back. I think I landed on my keys! Is he being carried away? Matt, how far are they from me? Wait. Hold on. I've got this. Quick, everyone. What's that over there? There. I'm going to step forward and inspire myself. (cheering) And then I will cast Bigby's Hand. Bigby's Hand! Because we're in a symphony hall. And I'm going to grab Vax and toss him out of the river. What does he get? What does Bigby get? I'm going. It's a different guy. He's a whole guy, who's not quite as handsome as me. Okay. 25. I give him a little pat on the head. He has pants? (laughter) Can I quickly inspire her? Yes. I turn to her and I sing (singing) Repairing up your heart when she heals you! And when you are a bard, you feel it, too! And no matter what you do, she heals the pain, and she's pretty, too! With my dice? You guys, we defeated a creek. How many more rivers would we have to cross? But that just gets us across one, right? No, there's ten more rivers! Can we become mist form? Are our minds affected when we're mist form? Yeah, where's he? Has my minute of Hand worn off yet? All right. I'm going to take Garmelie and throw him across as many rivers as I can. (cheering) 25 again. Oh god. I think I just killed him. He's doing great. Wait. The total distance from us to the end of the 12th river is how far? So I can make it with Pike super fast. Yeah. But the rest of you are fucked. I can set it, forget it. Set it and forget it. Don't tell Trinket! Okay. Give me the rod. You take the eternal string or whatever it's called. Sure, let's do it. Okay. Pike, you with me? Hand in hand? Here we go. I Dimension Door us across the river, if it works. All right. Hey! Shoot an arrow at me! That's a long shot. I instinctively cover my neck. Oh yeah! I forgot that whole part of the plan. Pike, do you know any sailor's knots? Can you tie a sailor knot around this Immovable Rod? Which one? Don't forget Vax. And then leave a little slack for Garmelie at the end. Like a thing? Like a person? Are they multiplying? Oh no, it's because we got them wet! Wait, where are we? Where are the gnomes? Oh no, we have to go back! Pikey pants, what should we do? We should go help them, right? I mean, this mud is nice. This is crazy. I got a four! We were caught off-guard by this whole thing. She was teaching me the swirley-whirley while this was all going on. In a way, it doubled in its level. Goes away? Seven more crocs appear. Laura just quit the show. Such a stickler. (cheering) There's children in the audience. Pike, I'm standing right next to you. So exciting. I can't! I'm across the river! I'm going to help everyone else but you. Can I inspire anyone over there? Okay. I'll inspire Keyleth. I'll sing to her (singing) Believe it or not, you're killing a croc! You never thought you could feel so free! Slashing away on a giant fucking croc. How can it be? Believe it or not, it's because of me! (laughter and applause) It's not very powerful, though, and I would not like to shoot at the croc. I would like to shoot at every segment of rope between every single person. (cheering) And for my movement, I will grab Pike around the waist and pull us back five feet off the edge of the pond there. Thanks. Here's the big roll, guys. I thought he had it out already. It was on his head, right? His favored terrain is vomit. Can I Cutting Words him? Okay. I will Cutting Words him. I'll say Mm-Grog (vocalizing) Grog (vocalizing). Yeah! It's supposed to distract him. What do I roll? Eight. d10? Eight. Don't worry. I won't sing Hanson again. Wait, it could be anything? Okay. You had advantage on them. Matt, if I can be a stickler, I also Cutting Wordsed him, so that puts him at disadvantage on a save. This is a kangaroo court! Yeah, I know. Okay. I don't know, man. Is it a large creature? I know it's large, but how large? Okay. Well, then forget that. Okay, I'm going to Eyebite him with my eyes of craziness. Put up the hand cone, and I'm going to try to make him sick. And I won't really move, but I will inspire Grog, because he needs to hit something, man. I'll inspire him with a limerick. A warning from your favorite bard In the Feywild, you should be on guard. I went off to take a shitter, and saw, like, a thousand Critters. (cheering) Staying where I am. Don't forget to loot the body? I'm looking at the trees. I'm hanging out. I wave my hands and say I'll catch you, Kiki! I will receive that. Set! Use your new dice! Who's left? Garmelie? I've got the mansion. How do we do that? Do we have to say a magical word? Okay. Whenever a woman tells me to sit on something, I do. (laughter) I'll sit front, so you can have your arms around me. (hacking spit). Bye, guys! 16 here. 32. I rolled a natural 20. (cheering) Burn it down. Oh my god! I could talk to them, but I want to know what they are first. We should do some recon and at least see what kind of creature they are. I can't just knock on a door. What if it's a crazy monster that pops its head out? I'll go up and talk, but aren't you curious? Yes! Do you care more about the broom than me? You've known me for years! You just met the broom! No, I need the broom to get away! What could possibly go wrong? All right, Pikey. Let's go knock on the door and get killed. We're already cruising. What? Who said that? What? I'm getting mixed messages. You're not there. Come back? Should we do a fly by the window to see what's inside? Fly by the window and peek in. Using our expert flying skills, we're going to fly by the window and do one of these, and check out the Berenstain Bears and then run. Not good. Eight. They look nice. Small? I don't. I see it and I turn around and I say Pike, let's get out of here. We bolt. We bolt for it. (hacking spit) And start flying. Back to our friends. I grab Pike, and we both go invisible. Invisibility. I guess at one level higher, right? Is that what I do? Level three Invisibility. We start tip-toeing out, I suppose. Well, the broom stopped flying. Have we stopped broadcasting?
