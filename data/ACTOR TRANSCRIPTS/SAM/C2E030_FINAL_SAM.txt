Thank you. D&D Beyond! Thanks to D&D Beyond for sponsoring and helping out with the live show. Your sponsorship dollars will help our cast pay for the therapy they need after seeing my junk so close and personal. It's been a while since Travis and Laura were here, and this is their first show at the new studio. So D&D Beyond wanted me to bring them up to speed, to catch them up with things, with all things CR. Here is your update, you might want to take notes Laura, the new wifi password is "DallasSux" with an "x." Travis, we rented out your parking spot to Brian Foster. The cardboard box he lives in will be parked there until September 15th. The Wayfarer's Guide to Eberron, The Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica are both available on D&D Beyond. Travis, while you were gone, we discovered Fjord's middle name is Bronco, so that's canon now. Laura, while you were gone, your dice were all loaned to Wil Wheaton for a little while. The break room is open to all, but from 900 to 1100 in the morning, Max uses it to poop. We have a code system for reserving the makeup room, so no one walks in. If you're breastfeeding, hang a sock on the door. If you're waxing Sam Riegel's chest hair, you hang a bandana on the door, and if you're having sex, leave the door open because that's kinky. Travis, we reinforced your chair to accommodate your baby weight. Laura, you are a perfect creature who creates magical life with the power of womanhood. Taliesin's new character is a cleric, so you don't have to heal anyone. Liam shaved. It's Ashley's birthday. Marisha no longer thinks sleeves are bullshit, now she thinks they're assholes. All firblogs--bolgs know each other. If you go number one, please use the bathroom marked "Peeastock." If you go number two, use the one marked "Hupperdook." And there are flies motherfucking everywhere in the studio. And that's it. To D&D Beyond, for sponsoring that inane list. It was the magnets. Just blame the baby. That one right there. Yeah. The bumper sticker. Case closed. Oh, yes, okay! I'll take whatever is on her mouth off. Hello. Well, we followed the clues, we traced the evidence, we thought about it logically, and also this girl who was walking down the street told us where to go. Yeah! Oh, let me untie you. I'll cut out-- cut off her hands. How are you doing? Oh, sorry. Are you sure he's not just--? Okay, we'll help him out. I don't, no. Oh no! Fjord, are you all right? Are you injured? Did they cut off your thumbs? Oh, I don't know. Do you guys see Yasha? Hey! Beau, do you see Yasha out there? Well, let's-- let's move. Yes. Yes, I think so. We haven't scouted around every-- We had some help. Shak√§ste's here. We met him this morning. Yeah. He tried his best. He got right up in Lorenzo's face, and he just wasn't strong enough. I think so. Yep. Protto? To make them impossible to--? We saw blood when we woke up. Was that yours or theirs? We had no choice, I mean-- Big butt. (laughter) Unless it's him. He could come back from the dead or something. He's done it before. Nonagon? It's an honor. I've heard stories about people in captivity sort of resorting to primal instincts. I do know what you mean. Must have been cold at night. You had to snuggle for body heat. Ooh! That's all I need to know. (laughter) Oh, oh, oh! Kiri's fine. Kiri's okay, Kiri's fine. We found a new home. Oh, you did. (laughter) Oh, also, there's this town where there's these gnomes and they dance all night! Yeah, it's called Hupperdook. It's the funniest name. Before that-- I'd forgotten how long you were gone. Insight check. Has he been turned? Is he different, is he weird? 15. Who are you, really?! (laughter) Let's get out of here. We have two healers here. Three. I will assist. That's your job, isn't it? Here's a pencil. It'll be good for our taxes. Of people! Do you want me to check? I was assisting. Investigation? 22. Let me reach in. I reach in and think of gold. See if I pull it out. Did it feel cold in there or anything? Might just poke through the the thing. Why don't we do something that won't poke through? I'm going to reach in and think of-- Finger foods! I'm going to think of gems. Precious stones. How do you know that was close? I don't want to touch that. We'll take it to Caleb! We have it. You could've ruined it! Oh, but wait-- Let's see what Caleb can do with it first. Can I go through and look around for any papers or documents that would point to anyone else that he was working for or selling to? All right. Let's get the fuck out of here. There's bears. There's bone bears. There's also a road so we'll be okay. Sure, we're around. What if they have others working with them who come home? What's that new magic you used? (laughter) We found a strange bag. Maybe, when you're feeling a little better, you can look at it and tell us its magicalness. Oh no, whenever you like. No. Different from what we have? Who wants it? Well, you're the leader, Caleb. You tell us. Oh yes! He took a position of authority while you were gone, and he rose to the occasion. Have a fort party? What is it? What'd we get? Maybe we should open it. I will look at the coin for traps! 23! Yes! It could be a wedding invitation! Jonas? Maybe. "Time is of the essence, and should I not have it by the end of--" Queen... pillar? Queen's-- Quen'pillar? Is that a month? What is that? "Time is of the essence. Should I not have it by the end of Quen'pillar, I will be forced to end "our agreement and seek a business relationship elsewhere. I warn you we are fiercely loyal to "those who appease us, and staunchly resentful to those who do not." "When recovered, please deliver to--" Thank you? No-- "Tell him you have a gift--" SAM and What's the gist of this letter? Someone hired someone to get some stuff back from a thief. There's more stuff. If they don't get it soon, someone will be pissed off. Marius LePen? Oh yes! Yes, we saw one of these! It's in your belly! Hold on, this letter was for you?! Are you Marius LePen? Where did we find this? Glass bead? Was it beaded? The jade bracelet? I have shards of shiny pottery, silverware from the fish people. Human jerky, a dead rat-- A vase, some old flowers-- Okay, wait. Let the masters work here. Where did we see that? Where was that? Was that in the tree? That was in the tree. Underneath the tree, with the fish people. MARISHA and Okay, so the merrow stole that from a water place, right? The Way-- I'm a goblin, I spit. Or the clover crystal? Cloven? cloven crystal. And the merrow stole it from someone here. This is a mystery. It's evidence! Wear gloves. Evantica? The Captain. The Captain was the person who stole it? No. What? What is it? Is there a door? I'm going to walk in. Did it work? Hi! Ooh! Yeah! Hi! Oh, now we're trapped in here with the fart! It's like a big Dutch oven! It's a starter house, right? Yeah. I like it, too. Yes. It's brilliant. I love it! Caduceus, come check it out. How tall is he? Is his head touching the ceiling? How tall is the roof in here? You can do both at the same time? You're incredible! Oh, sorry. That's Keg, probably. Keg, we're in here! Yeah, she fought bravely. You would have been tortured and brainwashed. Sold and probably killed in a few months in a horrible-- But thank you, Keg. You were amazing. What did we get? Okay. What is it? Whoa! It's probably been through people's skulls, actually. I'll take it. You said there was lots of shortbows and longbows? Arrows? Bolts? I'll fill up. Also, I'll take some arrows as well. All right. Should we go to sleep? The blade's gone? Oh, it's a note! For me! It's really badly written. It's like Frankenstein wrote a letter. Should I read it to you guys? It says, "Nott, sorry for going before you woke up. Bad at "goodbyes, never really had friends before. Yuto was my only friend, but now you and I are friends. "This medalon, medalion, medallon-- this thing, was from Yuto. It will protect you. Thank "you for helping me. Keg. P.S. If anyone hurts you I will kill them." "Kill" is spelled wrong. I'll take it and put it around my neck. I am now invincible. (reading) "Bo," everything's crossed out, "Thanks." (laughter) Where are we going? No, no! We came to save you, the money's the bonus. Divide it up now? Didn't we promise to do something for you, like give you our blood or something? We never really discussed the finer points. I assumed that you were a vampire and that you were going to suck our blood. He makes tea out of things that grow on corpses. It's pretty good. Sounds good. Oh, shoot. All the horses are gone. Crapper, John. But we have a new lease on life. We have new horses, we have a new day. Let's go name some horses and steal them! Are there invisible cages on the carts? The cages are invisible, or whatever's in the tarp is invisible? If I stay outside and look in? Wait, what's invisible now? We have an invisible cart! How long will this last? Cool. Stealth cart! We're going to take four horses. We need horses to pull the cart, right? Aw. Are you going to do that? Me and Jester will be in the invisibility cone. We're going to do each other's hair, and make faces at everyone else in the group. (cooing) Us? But she's still lying unconscious? I think they can see the cart. They just can't see us in it. Yes. I will moon them. Are you guys going to go with her? We can tie it to the other ones. Who's going to pull our carriage? I named them and everything. I named all of the horses while you guys were in there! I named them Waterloo, Fernando, Mamma Mia, and Dancing Queen. (laughter) I guess Fernando and Waterloo. 14. Jesus. What?! You saw a drow creature from Xhorhas? You saw a crick? I could sneak up and-- What? Where'd you go? Oh my god! Oh hi. It was really cool, though. You were gone! It was crazy. Well, next time you use it maybe it will have a purpose. (laughter) I will message Caleb with my little wire and say Do you think we should stop? You can reply to this message. We lost him. I think he would have been happy that you got to say goodbye. But we should keep going. Yep. That's what this game is about now, Travis. We have to bring Ophelia to The Gentleman, right? Oh, I did the math between all the platinum and gold that we found, we should each get 163 gold pieces. Yes. Including Yasha, who I assume took her share. You're part of this as well. We took a bunch of your gold. We took 70 gold. We took some of Molly's gold. 163 gold. I just broke it down into gold. Who cares? Matt, did we find a bank to break change on the way? Okay. Do we remember the code to get in? What is it? You say, like, "I need a drink." Yeah. What is it? "I am here to help." Maybe Ophelia knows. Ophelia, do you know the secret code? It worked! That's the tree place, right? Also, Mr. Gentleman, sir, we didn't catch you at a bad time, did we? It seems that you just stepped out of the shower, or something? Should we come back after you've dried yourself off and made yourself presentable? Times five? I think your math is off. What is this, a tip? That is very honorable. Mr. Clay, this is "money" and you can use it to by things like goods or services. Oh, you know, like tailoring services. Yeah, so are the four things to make a set of seven? Ooh, secrets. Hey, Laura? How do you like the new layout of the D&D Beyond app? I don't think you've used it yet. Wow. Oh. Yes. Oh, boy. (pigeon cooing) Oh, yes! Thank you! It's from a cow! Could be a goat. Maybe just have some tea. They might have tea. Do you have tea? (forced) Ha! Yeah. (forced laughter) It's a good one. I've been working on it. Well, we'll just have some whiskey, then. Try it, Mr. Clay. It's from the earth, though, they made it from grains. They take wheat and barley and stuff and then they mash it up and let sit outside-- they let it decompose a little bit! That's how you do it! You take some, mash it together. Put it in a barrel. Let's have a shot! Oh, yes, very much. The earth is calling you to her. We can leave, right? He's making fun of your name! Of course! What? Okay! Have you not thrown up yet? You will. It's a lot of weight. You don't have to drink it-- Have you ever had liquor? Oh. Well, what happened? That's it? I don't think-- no, she's never drunk. Why not? It is very good. Is there a reason why you won't drink? Are you afraid? Wow, that's intense. They're huge! He's very drunk. Must be drunk. The tortle! Ionos? Did you notice The Gentleman's face when you mentioned that name? He looked over at Ophelia. It was very suspicious. No, you have to pick up on the subtleties of the human expression to get this stuff. Jester and I saw it. It was definitely suspicious. He did! Very good, Caleb! It's a tell, is what it is. I think I'll go mention it to The Gentleman. In passing! Is he still in the bar? Let's get out of this place. That's an island. No, I don't think that would do it. Okay, I'm going to stumble over to The Gentleman, and say I think we're going to head out now, but if you need us, we'll probably be at The Leaky Tap or something. Sure, sure. We've been summoned by this person named Evantica, so we're probably going to go find-- Okay. You don't know where she is in town? Or he? I'm not really sure. Okay. Cool, cool, cool. Well, off we go! Oh, Jester! Don't forget! We're going to talk about the Captain later! Yeah. I couldn't focus because there was so much dripping going on. It's a mask of water. It's disgusting. No, no. All right, let's get the fuck out of here! Oh! (vocalizing) My whole body starts glowing with the light. You set me on fire! Do we tell you now, or later? Money-wise, we each get 964 more gold. 964 each.
