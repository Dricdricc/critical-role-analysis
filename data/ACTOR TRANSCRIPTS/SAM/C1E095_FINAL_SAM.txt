It's the start of a new year. I tried to get the eyes on my nipples. Did you already do the shirts? It's an homage. Your face, my face. I might have enough that we can all wear one one night. (laughter) Credits. We're just going to share? What if you die? What if you die right now? It could kill-- It could kill you too. I think so. Wait, he got two wishes? You gave away two wishes? You just got a cure for cancer, and you gave it away? Matt's verifying. This is important. Way shittier! It's Laura's fault? No, I thought that we lost him in the dragon fight. Oh, yeah! What's it called? Bear Claws? Are we going in order, or-- what are we doing? I didn't have a place to stay. Well, I mean, if you'll have me. I can sleep on a couch. Excellent, because I don't think I could sleep on a couch. (laughter) You're not so bad, either. Braiding hair. Yeah, that happened. (laughter) Yeah, yep. She knows two songs. She sings them all the time. (laughter) That's true. Did you get antlers tattooed on your face? (laughter) Nice. Do you like me? Check this box. Well, you were until that. (laughter) By a 12-year-old. I was just making that fuckin' armor. (laughter) That's right. Unnecessary bodyguard. (laughter) Cervix? (laughter) History? Wow. They kept singing about a Technicolor Dreamcoat. (laughter) I was doing a lot of work. (laughter) -- afternoons at the workshop, and then an hour and a half every night enchanting it. Yeah. It did. I got this thing on my finger, I was later told that that's what happens when you work with your hands. (laughter) Warby Parker. Rose gold is the best. Time. Well... Taryon had a great year. You've heard much of what he's done. Mainly just building and working and working and building. And in his spare time, he built and worked on things for himself. Chief among them, Doty! Doty 2.0, take this down. Yes, see? A little bit. Doty, how handsome am I? I heard "very". And Doty, what do you say when it's windy outside? It's airy. Right? That's what I heard. Oh no, boo! Yeah, it is scary. He says a lot of things. It depends on the context, you have to sort of figure out what he's saying. But he can say that, he can say one word. It took a lot of money to do that, but it was worth it. He's also got a couple of upgrades. He's got a waterproof slot for the book inside of him so he can store my book. Yes, the crest of Vox Machina, right on his chest, emblazoned there. His arm works a little differently, his right arm, which we might see in some sort of competition at some point. And his left arm, thanks to Percival Fredrickstein von Mussel de something. He's got a little hole right here in his hand, that-- It's got some girth. But it can fire a shot, a bullet shot. I've never used it before, but it can shoot something. Yep. And I think that's the major improvements to Doty, other than the speaking and the other stuff. Let's see, what else did I do? Oh, I also bought him-- I bought a lot of stuff. I'm almost out of money, guys. That is not what I would call money. No, I'm talking about actual money that you can buy things with. I bought Doty a pair of boots. The Boots of-- Yeah, I bought a lot of stuff. The Boots of Elvenkind, so he's a little more stealthy when we go around. I also tinkered with my armor, or did I have it tinkered on? Yes, so I have breastplate armor that has black dragon scales embedded in it, right? And it gives me a little more protection against acid, and it also looks cool. A little darker flair. And so I could communicate with them, I built myself a little earring-- it's a little different from yours, it dangles and it's got a nice gem on the end, because if you're going to wear it, at least look good. And also, in my spare time at Vex's house, when she was asleep-- she's a snorer-- sometimes I would be awake and I would examine her broom a bit and decided to make myself one too. (gasping) Now we have two brooms. We can leave those fuckers in the dust! I am out of money. I have a teeny bit left. But I also bought some other things. Are you back? You were gone? And I wrote. A lot. Just a lot of writing, and I'm probably halfway through that book by now. I've already got one. Thank you, Percy. That's very kind. Well, I hope to have an accomplishment to add to it. Sure. I killed a marid, right? I mean, go on. Mm-hm, yeah, yeah. Pike, what do you like about me? My profiteroles are really good. I don't think we had a name for them. Profite-roll for initiative? Thank you. Well, thank you. It is, isn't it? All right, all right. Now I'm embarrassed. But thank you. Thank you. Doty, you got all that? We need a place to stay. Right? Preferably a fancy location. We used to summer in warmer climes. That's right. And-- Well, we should get some cabanas. (gasping) And some people to wait on us. And we should-- Preferably near water. Swimmable water. And we just relax and tan, and sip mojitos. (laughs) (laughter) (laughs) Vacations are my favored terrain. (laughter) I will certainly be of help. I'm afraid I can't pay for us this vacation. All right. Well, let's find a resort of some sort. Or a relaxing spa! Or a--- (laughs) Yeah, sure. I will help her. All right! Oh, well, he's not really a person, but-- He doesn't eat. So-- He doesn't sleep. Doty? Are you okay with staying on the beach? He said very. (laughter) Ten days? Ten days? We'll get bored after eight or nine. Yeah, we never treat ourselves. It is? Pike! No shit! We said he didn't eat. He drinks. (laughter) I have a gift to give to Vax! I have a gift to give. 'Cause we're in the Bay of Gifts. You know, we haven't talked much over this year since I've been helping your fucking sister. But, you know, I've talked to her a lot about how you have this ongoing sort of teasing war with Grog. And I have acquired something for you to use in this battle. Use it when the time is right. Oh, oh, oh! No! Okay. (sings) Ahh! I'm still trying to pressurize. (laughter) I'll help you with that sand castle. Do you want me to bury you? All right, sure. We're friends. All right. I'll step into the gigantic hole. Sure. I've spent a lot of money. A lot. Not a lot. Oh, this is fun. I should have taken my armor off first. It's chafing me. I thought this was a formal trip. Doty, lift me up, please. Undress me. Great. Let's build the best castle ever. Do I know how to do that? I am a tinkerer. Sand castle rolls. I'm going to go to my history knowledge and try to base it on one of the famous castles from my youth, of my land. From the Truscan Empire. 16. (sighs) You know, maybe we should have-- you know, let's just try one more time. Just be very careful, Grog. Because you were backing up and I think you knocked into it a little bit. It was probably Doty. All right, let's do one more try. And really put some artistry into this. We want a moat, we want defensive towers. I'm going to put a little alchemic fire in the middle of it, so if anyone gets through the gates, they explode. Of course. Yes. Let's do it. Just straight intelligence? 13. Yes, yeah, this is coming along great. God fucking-- Grog! You stepped-- I mean, the central structure held the whole thing! I'm getting a sunburn because we've been here for so-- (sighs) You know what? Just bury me again. Just do that. Bury me again. Aren't you skin-diving? (sighs) I need that helmet, Doty! My helm, please. Yeah. What do you mean, "Tary?" (laughter) Don't tell me "Tary!" Your number one job is to take care of me, and your number two job is to take care of my belongings! That stuff is worth more than you! All right, just get me out of the hole. Ow! Let's go find my armor. I'm going to go look around for it. Survival? Ten. Oh, no. That's a four, so that's three. I'm a negative one for survival. I thought it was 11. Excuse me, pardon me. Sorry to interrupt your vacation. Have you seen a lot of armor and a big golden helmet? No? Okay. They're all German tourists. Yes? Percival? My dear friend? I don't believe that he would do such a thing. Let's go to Percy's room. I'm going to go knock on his door. I try the door. Chime of Opening. (laughter) We were science bros! How could he? Doty, this calls for revenge. What of his belongings are there? Of his. What can we do, Doty? What can we do? Good idea, but a little bit too cruel. (laughter) All right. I'll go to my cloak and tear off the Patch of Two Mastiffs. They're two big dogs, right? Yeah, all right. And I'll throw some kibble all over the place and be like, go on, just chew everything up and make a mess and pee wherever you want. There's food in there. Eat it all. Scratch through everything you want. And use this as your latrine as well. Good doggy. All right. You're free now. Go away. I don't know. Yeah, just stay here, go, whatever you want. I don't know. I feel weird. I don't need a pet right now. Let me look. It just says Two Mastiffs. I think they just are. (laughter) Oh, shit. Yes! I can too. You were putting on your boots? Forget rolling for sand castles, this is it. (laughter) A big title card comes over the frame Night One. (laughter) What is that? Oh snap! I'm getting night cream put on me by Doty. (laughter) (giggles) Wild dogs? Honor yourself. I'll take off my blinders, my night-blinders. My mask. Come in. Oh, yes. He sings me to sleep now. It's sort of a ritual we have. Did you have a nice night, Little Elf Girl? Well, between you and me, I did. You see, Percival played a little bit of a prank on me, and I got him back. But he told me that it was-- He told me-- You've taught me so much, but not about the human heart. (sighs) I am so sorry. I should have trusted you. I should have not doubted my staunchest ally, Percival. Of course, someone as trained as he is in the sciences wouldn't lie to me like that. I failed you. I'm so sorry! (laughter) Doty, go clean their room. I'm so sorry. But your brother. Trinket peed on him? Well, that's pretty good. I feel like there's more revenge to be had, but you know what? We're on vacation. That's nice. All right. I'm so sorry. Will you forgive me? You, too. He can last forever, so just as long as you need him. He'll wash whatever you need. He has motor skills. Not fine motor skills, but he could try to sew something if anything was ripped. And if you ever need more dogs? Sorry? I'm sorry? Call him off? He's cleaning your things. I should have been more specific. This is my earring, by the way. This is how I have to talk with it. I have to dangle it. All right, I'll be right there to give him more specific instructions. I'm coming. Is that what I have? I love it. Honestly, this is the best color. It's so cool. It's kinda like rose gold, therefore it's the best. (laughter) I'm at the Slayer's Cake. I am making blondies. Rocks? In Gnomish, welcome to the store. Any family of Pike Trickfoot is family of mine. I am one of her closest friends, Taryon Darrington. Here you go. Blondies on the house for everyone to celebrate your blondie, Pike Trickfoot. Oh, I don't know that at all. What? Really? I've got more. Sure. You can take all you want. Everything in the store is yours. Of course! Doty, go fetch some water for these fine gnomes. Ugh. You know, family is everything, and I'm so pleased to meet you. Can you tell me what she was like as a child? Taryon Darrington. I told them they could have anything they wanted in the place, free of charge. Agreed. A bunch of kittens on a man. We have a great new shirt in the store. It says Vox Machina. Oh, but don't fill up, because I assume we're all going to have dinner tonight together, right? In my broken Gnome, I tell him it's an honor to mate you. (laughter) I love him. Let's go freshen up for dinner. What? I thought they were Pike's people. Okay. Of course. I'm sorry if I was out of line. I love you. I'm going to pop into the kitchen after she's done. (laughter) What lady? She was being polite. These are good people. They need to be treated-- Who's your manager? Oh, you're right. She is your manager. I do have Luck. What am I doing? That's 24. These are Trickfoots, man. Trickfoots! Treat them as you would your own mother. I go out and grab Vex. Little EG, what are you doing? You told them to give them bad food tonight? These are Trickfoots! We have to treat them with honor and respect. I would give him the best. What are you talking about? They've been nothing but nice. They've showered her with kisses and affection. It's affection that I've never even seen in a family before! But I get to practice my Gnome. I'll back off. Always. "Those are all the foods I know." Flask of Courage? This is not what I asked for. Everybody hates taxes. Is this Undercommon? Underdark? I'm listening. Like Mr. Ed. I could talk to these people all night long. But if we should turn in? Whispers! So, Taliesin, what's the V? What's the V on this shirt? Who is represented by a book? Oh, okay. And what's the M in Machina? Who would that correspond to? Oh, yeah. That makes sense. And the A? Also Scanlan. Yeah, sure. And the C? Oh. They all have a giant birthmark on their face. (laughter) Swapped at birth? I have everything that I own on me. Am I missing anything? I think they're lovely. This dream that the old one talked about, does that worry you? Tomorrow we should go visit him? He's got to be at least 150 or 200 years old.
