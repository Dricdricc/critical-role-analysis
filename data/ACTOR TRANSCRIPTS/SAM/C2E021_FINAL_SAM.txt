Dirty ass voice actors? Hey everybody, D&D Beyond wanted you guys to know that Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes is out. Big news here guys, it's not Mordenkainen's, and it's not a Tomb of Foes, as I've been saying it. It's Mordenkainen's Tomb-- Tome of Foes. Fuck! (laughter) It's so good! Okay, roll that tape.

Those were the animators. Go visit at Twitter @Karekareo. We'll put it up on the thing. You can visit their Patreon, Patreon.com/kiframe. It's really cool, and it's really fast, so we thought we might play it again. It's not me, it's them! It's the D&D! I did like seven or 12 tracks of harmony. There's all kinds of stuff going on. The drum fill at the end there's a real drum fill, but it's also me going Do do, do do, do do. (laughter) Full of good stuff! It's like an Easy-Bake Oven. Should we see if the-- oh, no. The horses were taken. We've been hired by creepy people, but not by-- Oh, so I'm wearing a mask, but that is a different kind of mask. It's not a dragon mask. She's doing you. Yes, he's my dad. Yeah. What's the item? I mean. I'm sure my father would want to know what's the item. Like a bowl or a bowl? After-school activities. I tell him everything. Which is not a good answer. No. Only 56 more minutes until breakfast is ready! Can you do that again, Kiri? Have we ever heard this sound before? You've never fought? Caleb can teach you all about magic, he knows all the spells and he's very wise. Yes! Bren. I love trinkets. They are. They always have been. Oh! Illustrated? Illustrate all the things that could happen. Castration. Are we taking the cart? Or just going on foot? Sure, Papa. May I have my allowance now? He is, but fair. Nine dragons. He's only got one eye, he can't possibly see what's going on. I'm going to use my ring of water walking, and I'm going to be the same level as Beau except 30 feet to the right. Just as a flanking-- We're all pretty sure about that. It's "Mee-ster Ford." I'm keeping watch on the right. Yeah. Nah. One. Clear on the right! I don't know. What? Oh. Yes, it's me, Bren. Yeah, I'll be right over. Febron, do you have any cups? I don't want you to-- Have some booze. I'll fill it to the brim. Cheers. He's very wise, he'll be fine. He's a high roller. MATT and Jesus. Witch Bolt. LAURA and Oh shit. How's it going over there, guys? Nope, all clear! Yeah. It's clammy. We always move at a medium pace. Nice, he's dead. Hold on. We're not done. Keeping watch? What do you mean? Which side? There's nothing over here on my side. How do you know that? Shut up, Jester. Are you going to stay behind? Who? Oh me, yes! Thank you. Stealthy, though. Should we create a distraction for it first? You're a cultist? Cult-ish? You could heal him and curry favor with him. What if we set a trap or an ambush for him or her? We could do a little circley-poo and put Cali in the middle as bait, and then when it comes to attack, we spring the trap! I don't know, I've been drinking a lot. Someone walks up to it while the others flank around? I'll take Kiri, give me Kiri. Come here, little Kiri. My father won't hurt you anymore. It's not an ambush if they can see where we are. That you know of. Yep, on my way. You can do that? That sounds like a great idea. Oh, that's my job! Anyone who's dead, or just one dead person? Which body is fresher, Matthew? Let me check for traps on the smaller one. Oh, a lot. 25. Ten. Does her face look like-- Yeah, we don't know this person, right? Would you like to talk to this one? Well, let me introduce you. This is my friend, Jester. Jester, this is a dead body. Just be confident. I don't think you have to talk like you're dead. I've never done it, you know more about this than me. Where? When? How many questions do you get? (spookily) Ooh. One more question. Either where this happened or where they were hiding? Or, we could ask if there's a secret entrance to the safe house. Then we've wasted a question. That would be an interesting story. I'm going to check behind us and see how far back Fermaw, what's his name, Febron? How far back has Febron gone? Hey, Febron! Don't go too far. There's a troll back there. I miss. I got a nine. Yes. No, we gave it to him already. I fired a shot that missed. A nine. 18. No, I got them. All words I've never heard before. I'll get within 30 feet. Fire a crossbow shot towards its foot. That's good. It hits, probably. 24? Sneak attack? No. Oh, terrible. Five points. I'll shoot again, with bonus action. Ooh, that's not as good. 13? I'll use the rest of my movement to duck behind a tree or something while I scream. What?! Way to go, Mee-ster Fjord. We have to stop it with magic, or nets. Beau dies. No. Caleb? Pus flew out of it. Aw Kiri. Okay, everything's fine now. I'm up? Okay, is there anything in melee range with it? No. I'll move within 30 feet. That's as close as I can get? I don't know that we're letting it go, so I'm going to cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter on it. Throw out a little piece of pastry and I'll yell to it What's a swamp frog's favorite drug? Croak-aine! (groaning) It's a 14. I'll use my extra action to attack. This is an extra attack action. I rolled a 16 plus seven, 23. Because it's prone do I get advantage or anything? Oh, natural 20, so it still hits, 23. But do I get sneak attack? No. Because it's prone, no. Oh, look. it's a ten to hit. I mean ten points of damage. I don't get a bonus action off of that attack? Okay, I'll fire again. Natural 20 and a 20, just a straight 20. Another seven points of damage. Let me see, at the end of each of its turns or each time it takes damage, a target can make a wisdom saving throw. Target has advantage on that save if it's triggered by that damage. Nice. Right, good to know. (Infernal voice) Get the fuck out of here. Sure, I'll take a shot. At disadvantage? 12. I've got one more hasted action. Terrible. 14? Okay, and a bonus attack action. 16. Hey, that's one! Eight points of damage. We know where he lives! We have one more question! Will you let our friend down? This is the gate of the safe house. Specific directions. I can see it, it's right there! Give me the charm. Yes. I don't check if it's magic. Can I look at the words? Shadycreek. Just real quick, I wanted to give a quick shoutout to my brother-in-law, Peter Habib of Mr. Fantastic Music. They did the track for the animated thing. (Scottish accent) I love it! Caleb also likes to burn his friends. Should we scan for traps? 19. No, go ahead. Like a tea set? What queen? So not a real queen? I feel like Caleb could have done it. He's being modest. He could do it. Bren! Well, what if something grabs me from under the surface? All right, I'll walk around. Sure. Oh! What's up there? What's up there? How far up? I'll just reach it with my Mage Hand. Yeah. All right. It's just a scarf? You want me to pull on the branch? I'll pull on that branch. Vigorously pull on it! Huh? (strained yelling) All right. I will check for traps. 16? 16. Great. You did it! But you did it. With my help. That was Caleb's fault. Yeah, Caleb can do light too; it's not the greatest. I've got to go down there? That would help. Gross. Wait! I'm just going to take a quick minute to stare into the eternal abyss of the dodecahedron. Oh my god what is in there?! I'll take a swig and go down the hole. Not great. Just a check? Seven. (whispers) Yes. (screams) I will throw out a feather and cast Feather Fall. (breathing heavily) Coming towards me or just moving? Cool. Oh god. Are you sending a message? I will reply to that message. There's a creature down here. I don't want to make any noise. If you're going to come down to join me, use a rope. I don't know. I'll go rushing in and find out. I'm going to gingerly creep around the corner. 15. Are they waiting, are they talking, what are they doing? Any other entrances or exits? Anywhere else to hide, or something to hide behind? While you're setting the stage, I'll message back up to them. Did I come down right where I am? Got it. I'll radio back up to the top and say There are three mermen down here with dangerous weapons. I am very outnumbered. Please come quickly, you can reply to this message. I'll cast Mage Hand and take a ball bearing across the way, but not dropping it, just holding it in place, just in case. Oh Jesus, he's going to die! Sailors' knot. Oh boy, they have all of us all crammed up in this little space. No, wait. We're not bringing Kiri down, are we? Are you guys bringing Kiri down? Oh my god. Uh-oh. Something's happening. Is there anyway to freeze the water or get rid of the water? There's a pool in the back there. That's where they entered and exited from. Don't you speak fish? You're half fish! He was born underwater! What is the other half? Quick, tell us your backstory! Someone create a distraction! We'll pop out and kill it. 15. Okay, average, average. Three, two, one, go! (yelling) Half-carp, half-orc. Orcarp. Carporc? Corpor. Ten. Wow, Ashley! It still doesn't see us, right? I'll fire at the one near good old Fjord. Mr. Fjord. Aw fuck. 12. Why would I have advantage? I'll shoot again. Slightly better. 14? Does this one get sneak attack? Terrible. Nine. 13 plus I'll take Fury of the Small, so that's 18. Then, can I get all the way to Mollymauk on my movement? Hi! Want some booze? (singing) Sicker than a ray of light! That's not a thing. This is Paul! You're casting? With bait? Hey, Marisha. Are you in melee with that thing? Ah, okay. I will lean out, and is someone engaged with this one, where I would get sneak attack? I will attack with a crossbow bolt. 24. Okay. Ooh, that's all terrible. 15. Shit. Can I use my bonus action to fire the other one? Why not? 15. That's six points of damage. No, I will stay there and huddle closer to Mollymauk. Did you step out? No, I'm huddling away from Mollymauk. Aw, because Oskar? Kiri? That's enough. I will try to conceal this from Cali. I will use my luck point. (gasping) 28. I just have to confer with Caleb. I'm going to come tell you anyways. There is? Should we fill in the hole? Ooh! We have thunder sticks! We just killed Fjord's family. I will join him. Like, forever? Do you have gills? As they're doing this, I'm going to come up to Caleb and tap him on the shoulder and say Caleb, look what I found! I think this is the bowl that Cali was talking about. You don't want the bowl? Okay. Do you think it's bad to give it to her? Do you think it's bad to give it to her? Okay. Then let's give it to her. (snickers) You have the helm. You can just go with Nott. I do. Sure. This is very nice of you. He has-- yes. You're welcome? Thank you. It was lovely to meet you-- and he really does have the best of intentions. I know he will be. Yes, he will! Why are you saying it like that? Because he will. Okay! (laughter) We were supposed to get some sort of bracelet. Over shit!
