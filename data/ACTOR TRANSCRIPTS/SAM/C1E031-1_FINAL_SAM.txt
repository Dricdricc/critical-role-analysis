Are we on? Hi, guys. (breathless) Oh yeah, sorry. (laughter) Oh, I've got to finish mine. Wait, we don't know who sent it?! Which is really what you want. Is that true?! Oh, did the Amazon pilots launch today? I directed one, too, called Yoyotoki Happy Ears. So that's on there too. Yoyotoki Happy Ears. It's really weird and funny, and it's actually really awesome. I guess he's not coming on our show, jeez. But I was just handed this. I've never been a triceratops before. All right, you're right. Think like a triceratops. So, I need shelter. I don't know. How do triceratopses think? Hip-hop-ipotimi. Lovely decor. I think I can take them, guys. I think I can take them. Wow, that's going to be fun later, but not right now. Okay, do I know? So, let's assess my knowledge real quick. I know about him a little bit. He is one of the thugs that came into the city. He is not a magic-wielder, as far as I know. As I quickly survey the room, do I see anyone else who is a threat greater than a heavily armed guard? Anything that is a creepy wizard or a weird old mage? So they'll probably all shoot me, won't they? So directly in front of me, there's a staircase going up? Any other doors or exits? Those are locked doors? Oh, man. Initiative? Don't I get a surprise round? Doesn't matter. 21. I don't get a surprise round because I sprung in there? Damn it. So here's the thing. Here's the thing. I should probably leave. But come on. I'm a triceratops! I've got to have some fun first, right? Right?! Wait, it's my turn first? I beat them with initiative? They are more than my charging distance as a triceratops, right? 40. I would be dead. I'm going to go-- How far away are the doors on the sides? I'm going to turn right and blast through that door. (laughter) Oh shit, it could be trapped. Well, we'll find out. Do I have to roll to blast through the doors? Okay, strength modifier says plus five. So that's only a 17. Me and doors don't get along too well. The door beat me! These fucking doors. So now I am stuck in a door? Next turn? Do I still have an action after this? Yeah, but it probably won't happen. It's not my turn anymore, right? That's it. My triceratops ass is sticking out. I'm going to die. I have no idea. 14?! Wow, these guys suck. That was six. Yeah. I have 115 hit points?! What does that take me down to? 81? Is that right? 115 minus 34, 81? Okay. Well, shit, then I've got to get some retribution. Am I considered flanked? Damn it. I do have a tail. I don't know how to hit things. I've never hit things before. Okay, I'm going to gore that guy to my left. Oh, that's a balcony. I thought that was a stairway down. I'm going through the door. Yeah, because I'm not tangling with Duke Vedmeyer or whatever. 23. Is that my action? That's my movement? Okay. (whispers) I should get out of there. But it's so fun. So, I am in the room. No one is in there with me. So where's this laser pointer? So, yeah. I'll just position myself right next to the the door there, and I will hold my attack until anyone runs through the door. They get an insta-gore. Oh shit, here he comes. Here he comes. It's me and the big guy. Oh god. I think I can take them, guys. Okay. Tell me this, did I hear a bunch of footsteps? Can I hear? (sighs) All right, I'm not good at fighting. I will-- I don't have any fire. I don't know why I was sent into this mission. I don't do fire things. I will drop my form. Is that an action? I'm going to-- hold on. Yeah, okay. I peek around the corner a little bit. Just make sure they're all there, and I will Stinking Cloud all of them. I've got to have some fun first. How often am I going to take on a whole house by myself? Oh, for sure it is. So 19. (laughs) It is the way I do it. I can still move? Okay, I'll do a Dukes of Hazzard over the table. Do I have to make an athletics check or anything for that? Acrobatics? What do I do for that? I know, but I don't do these things. 11. Okay, yes. So I'm near the window now, right? Okay, and that's, I guess, everything. Right? Okay. I'm shaking. Well, that hits. Of course it does. Against what? Oh yeah, that hits. Okay. I so want to get some payback, but I shouldn't, right? I think I can take these guys. How big is that diameter? Oh, I can't lift that thing. All right, one more round. What do you say, guys? TRAVIS and One more round. I am going to-- fuck. Do I have line-of-sight on the door? Yeah, that would be so fun. He could brain me. He could brain me in one shot. Okay. I will duck under the table so they think that's where I went, and then Dimension Door to the roof. Oh, okay. 31. Here I go under the table! Okay, great. Yeah. It's just me up here? Okay. I will go invisible and just hang and just see what happens. And then I start digging through my pockets, if I have any flint or fire-making apparatus at all. I will. I will look. Nope. I have some poison. Oh wait, I do have something. I have a Potion of Fire Breath. Well, but it's a potion. I don't know how it works! So I'm on a roof that's all soaking wet, right? There's no crawl space access? No attic I can get to? Okay. Whoa, nothing. Two. Okay. You know what? I'll just try it. I will Fire Breath Potion myself. I don't know what this thing does. I've just got this. Okay. And am I close to the entry point roof? The roof of the entry point? Can I get over there? Okay, so I'm just going to lean over the side and scorch the whole front entrance as much as I can from where I am. By the way, I'm also invisible, right? Oh, great! Wait, these are guards who are outside, yeah? That hits. That does not hit. Oh, no, the 17 does-- well, it would have. Because I'm a gnome, do I always have half- cover? (laughter) Okay. Do I know enough about this potion to know if it gives me any other breaths, or is that it? So I can breathe again? I have no idea what I'm doing. It's a bonus action?! Okay. Well, then. (laughs) Yeah. So I'll run over to the back side of the house and do the same thing. Shit. (shouting) Lovely home you've got here! Okay. How close is his hatch to the edge? (frantic breathing) Okay. (muffled) I'm trying. I'm just seeing range here. Five times your Spellcasting ability modifier. My Spellcasting ability modifier is-- what? It's charisma. It's five. Five times five, that's 25. That's 25 feet. Okay. (sings) Bigby's Hand! So I call forth Bigby's Hand and I will force him off the roof. (cheering) (sings) I want to fly away. TALIESIN, MARISHA, AND Oh shit, he's strong. 17 plus eight... I'm going to kill everyone in this motherfucking house! (laughter) Oh. I've got to get out of here. (laughs) Okay. Am I close to the hatch? I'll hoof it over there and just look around and punch myself in the gut, (belch). 4d6? I don't have any d6. 15. Do my eyebrows burn off? Okay. I've got to get the hell out of here, guys. Okay, tell me this, Dungeon Master. Dimension Door. Can it be used at higher levels? Okay. How about Polymorph? I'm fucked. (laughs) I don't know if Bigby's Hand can catch me. It's not like Feather Fall. Okay. Does Unseen Servant have any mass? Okay. So I'm just going to (hums a bit, then sings) I'm jumping in the rain. I'm jump-- so I'm going to jump off the-- can I go away from the Goliath? So not the two sides that are on fire. It's going to take a couple of turns to get over there. Okay. For the second guy, I-- no, I'll just take it. Okay. Okay, got it. Okay. I look back at them and I do that thing where you just kind of do this. (laughter) And I trust fall off the back of it. Oh, I do. (laughs) But I'm going to simultaneously make Bigby's Hand try to catch me at the bottom of it. Charisma? That's 20. Come on, Bigby. Catch me. Oh! Don't get handsy, Bigby. (laughter) All right. Is that my turn? So I'm going to-- do I get an action? No, Bigby's is a bonus action. It's an action? It says, "and as a bonus action on subsequent turns." Oh, wait. No, that's for moving it. The bonus action is moving it. I got it. Okay. Yeah, but the act of catching me was the action. Got it. Okay. So I'll just start running. (laughs) On my tiny little nubby legs. I'm planning to climb over the gate. (laughs) I've got nothing left. They're both pretty terrible. 16. That's athletics. Yeah. I'm useless to you guys. Yeah, I'm going to go invisible and watch from the shadows. It's cool. I think I'll wait it out if I'm in a relatively safe place, because I can't really do anything for you guys, anyway. You're on your own. Oh, I'm taking a short rest. Well, I still want to see where this giant thing goes, so I'm still watching it. Whew! I lived. (laughs) I never got a beret. Did I get a beret? Yeah, I wanted a beret. I'm not there. Are you getting a FaceTime? He's Spider-man? Why do they have advantage on you? That's reckless! Hello, is there anyone in here? You turn into an asshole. Kill things. What device? Are you doing what I did? You did it so much cooler than me! (laughter) You need some daggers? Spider-man? Oh, because you've got your necklace on. Never use reckless strike again. Wait, so all attacks, even follow-up attacks get advantage, even though he only gets advantage on the first one? No, it is not! It's the worst ability ever. Wait, did you not have-- Jesus, never use that thing again. Come on, you're my favorite bear, Trinkie. That was a critical "rawrl." Would she know what it was? Ooh, that's the intelligent dice. I'm on the roof? I'm doing this thing. Wait, he's still alive? Why would they even have a hypothetical for that? LIAM, MARISHA, and Is it like a hurricane or something? Whoa. Yeah, and also kill the bear. The Wind Wall gets an attack of opportunity. (laughter) And we fade to black. Wait, can you use your bonus action to wink at Matt to ask for forgiveness? Your answer for everything. All those?! Holy crap. You can. So polite. Oh no, don't fall on your ass. (pained) So detailed. Don't forget to tell them about Gilmore's Glorious Goods first. (laughter) You're going to shoot people in the back. Come on, girl. You have to make that decision yourself. You can do that? I can do that, too? I didn't know that. Well, not that spell, but with anything. When you see my cue, attack. (laughter) That was a terrible plan. This is sexy. And kiss him.
