D&D Beyond! Is the camera on me? I can't tell. It is on me! D&D Beyond, everybody. Last week we kicked off my campaign to become president of D&D Beyond. That campaign will continue through a lot of the year. We have lots of big things planned, but the campaign is taking a week off this week. Instead, I spent most of this week making an infomercial for our good friends at D&D Beyond. I shot, I edited it, I added music. It's a really cool piece. It talks about all the great features of D&D Beyond, how it streamlines game-play, and you should all go subscribe to it right now at dndbeyond.com. Anyway, I made this infomercial. I'm going to give it to Max right now. He's going to pop it up there and play it. I think you guys will like it. I'm an auteur, so don't be too critical. Whenever it's loaded up, Max, take it away. (muffled, singing the D&D Beyond theme song) Okay, that was not the right video. Sorry about that. That was a technical glitch, Max; that was not the right one. You know what, play the next video on the thumb drive. I'm sure it's the next one down in the folder, so go ahead and hit play on-- the next video will probably be the one. Kids, kids, let me in. Let me in the house. Kids, this isn't funny. Kids? Okay, no, this is embarrassing. You know what, Max, it's probably not that folder. Try the other folder, the one labeled "Sam awesome stuff". Try that folder on the thumb drive and play-- I'm auditioning for the role of Joel on the movie-- the video game Last on Us? Last on Us. (clears throat) Take one. (high-pitched) Ellie, do you realize what your life means, running off like that? No, Max, no! It's "Sam awesome stuff 2019", not "Sam awesome stuff 2012". That was the wrong folder! Go to the one marked 2019 and play that one. Come on, Max, get it right. Play it! Hey, Liam. I'm waiting. When you get home tonight, I might be asleep, but it's okay. Wake me up, okay? (kiss noise) Love you, baby. Bye. The video that I made, it talked about how affordable D&D Beyond is, how you can get your content, your guides, your campaign guides, all in one place. There's content for DMs and players. It really makes the whole process great. You know what, I think it would be safe to play all the rest of the videos. Go ahead and play all of the rest of the videos. [sensual music] [beep] Come on, guys, let me in the house. [beep] [rock music] [beep] [pop music] [beep] Yeah, they have canceled the contract. I don't think she likes Carmen Sandiego. (singing) Hmm-bop, boop ba doop a mmmbop. I don't know. I said "burglary taint." I was caught between two Carmen Sandiego things. Smart, smart, always smart. I will also change. I want to see what it would be like to be a goblin still, except with not green skin. Let's pick a different color. Maybe pink. Something that's like, "Oh, that's not a monster." Yeah. "That's a little pink pixie thing" or something. Wings? The tiniest wings. Dragonfly wings, yes. Is he mocking Orly? Oh my god! The Wharfmaster's a dick! Really? One of the cannons is broken. I found it that way, though, so you should probably fix that while we're gone. You seem unreasonably excited about that. Do you need any help? What, are you going to make something? Oh, yeah, that. Yeah, that metal box? Yeah. We could probably ask around for a blacksmith. Let's go ask around for a blacksmith. Why don't we split off and some of us can look for a blacksmith and some can look for a bookshop and then we'll reconnoiter somewhere. I would love to come along, yes. I feel like we've walked down this road before, at least twice. Yeah. Neither? You were just let up to your own devices as a small child? That's fun. Did you have many friends, growing up? Oh. So you were starved for-- The minotaur? That must have been fun. It all rhymes. (vocal accompaniment) And get a drink? A-wicka-record scratch! Where are we sleeping tonight? Well, I don't know-- Well, we hustled out of town because we had caused a ruckus. Not for very much longer. Mine's going to wear off in a couple of minutes. Maybe. I'll recast it, too. Sure. You can contact the others. We should have maybe said a place where we would meet later. Oh, shit. On the walk towards Mom's house, is there any little patch of grass or dirt? A park that we pass? I want to-- maybe while they were in there shopping, I want to put my hand in the dirt, feel soil, know that I'm on solid land. I thought I'd dropped a coin in there. I was looking for it. It's fun. (mud squelch) Oh god, no. I thought we were playing! (laughter) Yeah. (deep voice) I hate monsters. We'll drop our disguises. Do they know our names? They do that. We're giving that one to Orly, right? Do you know that tower that gets bigger and smaller the closer you are to it? Between dicks and buildings? What time is it about now? Let's go fucking break into it right now. Let's go right now! So what? We'll be fine! There's nothing in there. We're just going to steal some stuff. She's making a game system! Bring the paint. Caleb, I promise you, if we go scope it out tonight, we are going in tonight. Have you met these people before? Please, no. Also, we might be doing a covert walk-by of this place. That could definitely happen. That's valid. No, I don't like to be near when he reads. He needs to focus. In the interest of time, are there any potions that we find around? Hello! Hello! Is she mocking me? LAURA and I think we need some items here. Why am I the face of the group? Hi! We need some items. We're looking for some potions. Potions. I will also need some-- I was looking for some oil. Some oil. All right! (increasingly shrill) And do you have any healing potions? (shrilly) We've got coin! I feel like she's mocking me. Anything shiny? Eight. How much are they? (louder) How much are they? (quietly) That fair? We'll take them. Sure. Thank you. Anybody else chipping in? You can?! Do you have any flammable oils? Enough for a larger flask. Something that I could make a long line of oil with, if I needed to. I'll take it! Thank you. What is your name again? Sheila. Sheila Plobs-- Bobsnopper. Do you buy things as well, ma'am? I have some studded leather armor that I don't need any more. All right, get it out of the haversack. Here's some old studded armor. Studded leather. Says 45 on-- That's new, though. I'll take it. We chose wisely. Nice to meet you, whatever, bye-bye! I liked her, she was nice. She was great. Bobsnopper? We could probably kill her. The Tide Peak. The tower, right? Fjord? Don't you have an ability where you can disappear and reappear a few feet somewhere else? Could you not do that and just be quickly inside? But you could just disappear and reappear inside the wall, couldn't you? I'm just a caveman. All right. What?! Hick queens? Jester could get us up there. Caduceus has a tree. Caduceus, don't you have a magic tree? Not if we ride it up to the top, then leave someone behind to chop it down real quick. To be inside. Profit! There's no door. We were going to make one. What? Oh, jesus! You missed a bunch. No, it's true, but we need to figure out how we're going to talk our way into this place tomorrow. I tried but the little guy got away before I spoke-- There was a little goblin guy. Which, by the way, none of you should trust. He will turn around and stab you in the back the second you're not looking. Because he's a goblin. The front door. Can't you see it right there? (dolphin squeaking) Oh yes. We're going to need some information to give to get in. I don't know. Something that would make a powerful mage want to talk to us. We need to know a magical secret-- Or talk to him about Uk'otoa-- That's true. These are all truths. Not without money. Caleb will know what to say. With magic especially. He's an amazing talker. He's charming and handsome. Get a room! We're going back. I ate just a part of the tail but the rest of is a little chewed on but in paper for dinner. Caleb, what is going to get us in that door? Is it information about Uk'otoa? We talked about this over dinner last night-- We definitely did, we had a big dinner. Anyway-- He's just being coy. We need a story to get us past the fucking goblin-man who's keeping us from getting in the tower. Something to share, something that his master Yussa Errenis would find yussa-ful. I have an actual reason. A powerful mage, with access to magical spells and books. No! Maybe we just take a few books. It's true, and it's impending danger, I like that one a lot. That's right, there is still one Uk'otoa gate out there that we don't know where it is, maybe this mage knows where it is. We all have questions, and there's a lot of unknowns out there, and if this person could check off just one of the boxes, then that would be worth it. Maybe we make an ally and he can check off more than one box, tell us about the dodecahedron. We are. Is it on our side, or around the-- First good roll of the night. That's true. Give him some information! Dangerous information. We might not want to shout it in the streets, up to you! Give him some info! (quietly) Maybe take someone who can get word out? You plus one. You get a plus one. What might we want to show him? No. Is there any evidence? Do we have any items from the Xhorhasian-- the crick that we found? Do you want Fappy Fun Ball? You do want Fappy Fun Ball? Should we give him Fappy Fun Ball? Caduceus, just bringing this up you know that Beau ruins every situation she's in. And is horribly abrasive to talk to and sometimes look at. You're not taking the dodecahedron in, right? LAURA and But one of you should look at it before you go in. You should take Caleb, he's a master of magic! (quietly) Next! Yep. I think so. (crossbow cocking) I drop the fish that I was half-done eating. Yeah, let's go in. I'm Nott. But he learns very fast. Seems very fair, yes! Probably any day. He reads a lot of books. No, we just assumed. How do we prove our loyalty? We've been here the whole afternoon. We haven't fucked you over once! Anything to keep an eye out for? Well, they talked about-- yeah. We're all in. Did you already look at it today? Well, we're also sometimes bad people, so. Do you want to leave a pamphlet too, so he can find out more information? She does this a lot. Thank you for your time. These biscuits are real good. Mine tastes like fish! (laughter) Well, thanks. What new spell do you know? I feel his forehead. Does he have a third eye? Well, that was great! We got everything; it was exactly what I said! We would go in, we'd get some magic for you, we'd get some knowledge. Good job, Beau! Caduceus, good job! (monkey noises) Well, now what? What place-- what tower do we break into next? What do we get out of here? Hmm? Oh, is it? I hadn't been thinking about that every day. But yeah, it is. Wait, don't you want to spend more time with your momsies? Well, we could swing by, I wouldn't be opposed to that. But-- That's fine with me. To Alfield? Sure. Bryce! The O-Town Posters? Yeah. We love her; almost as much as you do. Half as much as you do! Hyah! Don't we have horses? Hyah! Didn't we have a way to get back in? No. What city is it? MATT and We don't have paperwork from him. Oh, okay. The gnome? Kosh Starosta? Kosh, Kosh, Starosta Kosh. Kosh what? Clearbarker. Aww, do we have anything? Wait, is this our invisible cart or did we ditch that? The cart with invisible shit on it? I'm going to try to refine that oil that I bought into more... burn-y oil? Is that something I can do on a moving cart? I mean I have, it says alchemist supplies. Sure, sure. They were both the same. Intelligence modifier? 16. Okay. Great! Three more. I think it's 25 words. Has no means to call you back. Gustav's out of jail, right? Cool, we're done there. Nothing in Trostenwald. We're going to Alfield, or are we bypassing Alfield? Are we checking in with Bryce? What? That might actually be safer. Say hi to everyone for us. Maybe not from Bryce. I mean, I like Bryce. Bryce is cool. We have the handwriting samples. Happen to have any forgeable paperwork of other cities' lawmasters? Good! Because that would be illegal and you're a person of the law. It was a trick! Yep, that. Hyah! Git along, little doggies! You meet a dragon. "What is the main export of Nicodranas?" I'm going to put my hood up, the mask on. Yeah, no. Yeah? You mean the clan? No, they don't live in the city. The fellow? My friend? Yeah, they're in the city. He's in the city somewhere. Yeah, I know where the house is. I'll lead them towards-- I'm going to start heavily drinking. I don't recognize either? 19. Do you want me to go sneak up or anything? I guess. Are we curious about that? (gasps) Holy boly. All you've got to do is ask. Archmage of something, Cerberus Assembly. Oh my god, I'm shaking right now. He's making the names so hard now that we can't make fun of them. What is he the Archmage of? Vess DeRogna. Yep. No, there's people out there he knows, you dummy. I'm a little on edge. You're not dumb. Glassy Grass? Stop the cart. Is anyone around? I'll cast Disguise Self and be some gnomish old lady. I'm going to walk over to the burned-down apothecary and start looking around. I'm looking for identifying signs of life or-- 15. Can I look for buttons? Aw shit. 11. No, I was just looking to see-- I knew the man who worked here. What's terrible? What happened? What things? Do you know what-- were you here? Do you know what happened to this place? Yes. Do I know Edith? He's okay? Did the party that came in to attack-- were they taking prisoners, or were they killing? Were you there? How did they get away, the cricks? Did they go underground? Which tunnels? Where? All right. Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss. Yes. Hmm? Yes. If you could, could you look around this wreckage a bit and see if you find anything interesting? I will unlock it. Not good. 15. Jester, open the door. Caleb. Open it. Is it magical? It wasn't. Mm-hmm. Does it look like there was a struggle in here, or it's been turned by someone looking for something? 22. 21. That's way worse. Yours is much better. I don't know. Chemicals. There was chemicals here. He kept chemicals. There's a box, you said? I'm going to go over and open it. Or is it locked? I will unlock it. That's 29. I open it. 19. I'll take another drink of booze and look in there. Hold something. Maybe. Does it look like the same metal of the dodecahedron? Any similar characteristics? Try it? No. No, I've never seen this before. I'll grab it and throw it to Caleb. "As we continue to invoke the beacon with extremely focused energy of different spectrums "and sources, the effects unleashed are curious, and reach far beyond this laboratory. The dunamis field--" Is that right? Have we heard that before? "-- sightlessly encompassed an entire portion of the town, with locals complaining of an ill, "sluggish sensation--" that's the Slow "--being dragged down. Others at different experiments "rumored of witnessing people and livestock moving at a noticeably faster or slower rate "within entire sections of the city in proximity to the laboratory--" "Based on our previous experiments and extracted techniques from captured Kryn operatives--" Yeah. Kryn operatives? "Based on our previous experiments extracted from captured Kryn operatives, the abilities of "dunamis and dunamancy within Xhorhas appears to focus around the manipulation of gravity--" "--entropy, and time. Yet, while the basis of what dunamancy origin glyphs we were able to "acquire show it to exist outside of the established schools of magic--" What you got? Yes. "This magic, by my theory, is deeply rooted in ancient history of some arcana we take for "granted. If these beacons are just the surface, what eons-old rituals have been lurking beneath "the citadel in Ghor Dranas?" Ghor Dranas? They were using the alchemist. They were using Yeza. "I'm beginning to believe it goes deeper. Between the fragments of power we've only begun to "unlock within these beacons, and the capabilities of the Kryn on the battlefield, I surmise they "have been learning to bend and break the threads of destiny for hundreds of years. Be this truth, "I cannot imagine the Raven Queen looks down upon them favorably either, though the thought brings "a laugh to my lips." Do I recognize any of this handwriting? No? Does he? We have a vial. I don't know. He's an excellent alchemist. They would probably need someone like that, but the Xhorhasians weren't doing this. Someone else was. Right? Your people. Your people were doing experiments and trying to find out and harness the power of-- What? It's your people! It's the people that you know and trained with. Well, fuck him! It's your people that have done this to my people, and we have to find them both. Not right now. I have to go see Lady Edith right now. Huh? No? Nothing under the chair? We took the trap out? We took the vial? What? I need to check on-- I'll take another drink and then look outside to see if anyone's watching. We'll go back to the cart. How far is Edith? Okay. Cart or walk? Cart? Okay. I'll Disguise Self as a halfling. Plump face, tan skin, braids. I'll start pounding on the door. Edith, it's me. Where's my son? I'm not. Let me see him right now. (sniffles) Hi. No, they didn't. I'll pull out the doll of King Bertrand and give it to him. I brought you that and other toys. How are you? Are you okay? Did they hurt you? No, no, no. He's alive. I know he is. Did they touch you? The mean lady? What does she look like? Who is she? Oh my gosh, it's so wonderful to see you. I pick him up and give him a big hug and a kiss. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. She comes often? You go somewhere safe when she comes? What about the last time? Yes? Very smart. You're very smart. You've always been a very smart boy. You're a good boy. Good job. Stay safe. When you were running away, did you see anything of Dad? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I wasn't there to protect you. I-- I was far away. I was trying to get back. I was trying to come back, I was. I was trying so hard, but I don't have-- I'm not strong enough to come back yet. (stutters) But know that I'm always thinking of you. I send you things so you remember me, and I hope Dad gives them to you. Oh. Well, that's fine. Yeah, it would be hard to understand, but I love you so much, and I've never stopped thinking about you and trying to come home. I didn't want to go away. I'm going to find your father. I will, and then maybe we can be a family again. Maybe-- I will find him. I promise you, all right? You just have to be that smart boy that I know and stay safe, all right? In my heart I think he is. I will be, too. Thank you. Sorry, Edith. Do you have family somewhere else, somewhere out of the city? Out of the village, I mean? Ah. Is this--? I don't know. Are there any strong-- How do I--? To protect them. Travis I think they got what they came for. I think it's safe here now. What if the next attack is there? So they'll be okay here? No. I don't know. I don't know. Okay, maybe lay low for a little while, a few days, a few weeks, and then-- Okay, yes. She can send you a magical message, and you can tell us where you are. I don't know if they would make that. That's a long journey. I don't either. I don't know. I'm not thinking straight right now. Okay. Stay here for now, and stay safe. We'll come back soon. Thank you. "Yeah?" All right. Oh, boy. The chair is the key to everything. It's the thread that holds it all together. Oh, fuck. Oh, boy.
