What? Tickets are still available online, post the link right now in the chat, someone, please. (laughter) Backblaze is back, everybody. I've already composed a song about it. It goes like this (singing) Everybody, yeah. Backup your data, yeah. Upload your local files to an encrypted cloud-based backup storage system, yeah. Backblaze back, all right! (speaking) That was good! Backblaze is unlimited cloud backup for Macs, PCs, for just $5 a month. You can back up your fanart there, your fanfiction, the dirty stuff, photos, videos, drawings, documents, it's everything. I actually use this service. My stuff is continually uploading to the cloud and I always know it's there for when my hard drive crashes, they'll send you a new one in the mail-- They can mail you one. It's all kinds of crazy options. And Critters get a fully-featured 15-day free trial at backblaze.com/criticalrole. So go check it out, keep that song in the back of your mind when you do. (laughter) Do you want to hear the song again? (groaning) Twice. It won it twice. Didn't you just get some card or something right at the end of-- Did we know what it was? Oh my gods, what just happened? (laughter) I heard growling. Did the bear try to kill you? I mean Trinket. Tea set? What just happened? Pics or it didn't happen. (laughter) If you do. It's a touring production. I'm one hundred percent behind any decision you made or make, by the way. You say "go," we go. You say "stay," we stay. By that logic, mathematically there's no more bad shit in there. Ten or higher we go. (laughing) We're so going. That's not what I was expecting. Jackpot? We can't take the skull. Oh, it's an animal skull. Can I discern what kind of animal skull it is? Eight. Still alive. Everything's okay. It's all gold and silver. Made of gems or stone or bone? Oh god. Listen, Grog. I don't think it's very valuable. It's pretty amazing. This is cool. But what would we do with it? We can't trade it. I bet something still worships it. And that thing could come back and be mad if we take it. I wouldn't mind getting a closer look at that skull. We can't walk over there without disturbing candles, right? I can grab it. I do have a big hand. What do we do? Do we just leave and come up with a good story? Okay. Here, how about this let me cut your face. When we run out, you'll be bleeding and crying, and it'll be horrible. And we'll just make something up. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Right above the eyebrow so there's lots of blood, yeah. Okay, cool. I'll take out my-- not Mythcarver. I take out my other longsword. My Aberration Bane longsword. I'll slice him right over one of the eyebrows. (yelling) There are bears everywhere! Bears! Little bears, big bears! There was a bear right on Grog! It was horrible. I was in the mouth of a bear, and Grog cut the thing from asshole to lips to get me out of there. It was crazy! Did you bet to see whether we would live or die? Some candles. Big skull. A gemmed skull. Not gemmed. A gem-like skull. Not diamonds, not rubies. Opal. Something. It was a worthless endeavor. We're sorry we went. Seems like a place of worship or devotion, and we didn't want to mess with it. Vex, what do you think, is a semi-precious gemstone skull worth going in and getting? What time is it? And we've been awake for a while? Natural 20, except disadvantage because I'm exhausted. 16 plus two. Oh. All I know is my mansion spell has been ticked off. So I used it at least once in the last 47 hours. Yeah, I'm close. He was just going to get us to the outskirts. That was always the plan. He knows things about the Feywild that we don't know. Also, if it turns out he's not who he says he is-- We'll find out who he really is later. All right, let's just put Vex and Vax. Grog, can I ride on you? Yeah, I just need to be reading. No. Grog weirdly smells better than Trinket today. You hear music? Can I listen? I want to hear some music. But this is the theater. Do I recognize the music? It's a stream. It's nothing. Can you make us a bridge, Keyleth? Well, that's even better. Should we send Vax ahead? Oi! You lot! I just had a thought. If there's music, there could be some sort of charm effect. Would you like me to come with and maybe counter that charm effect? All right, I put down my book and hop off of Grog and go up there. I don't think you cast it on me, did you? Am I there yet? I'm exhausted. Same. What is it? Oh! Hey, that's 18! That's not bad. Can I be doing Countercharm? Can I hum a little tune? Is that how it works? I don't know how it works! It lasts six seconds?! All right. I'll keep humming. Sure. I'll hum loudly. Shit. We'll stealth, and if it starts to feel icky, then I'll do it. Can I sing to him through the earring? No, we talked about that before. I'm going to stay behind. Where we going? I start singing. Countercharm. (jazzy saxophone riff) Yeah, I already had advantage. 13. Save? Check? Ten. Check or save? Ten. He was very close to death. I'm doing the Russian Bottle Dance from Fiddler on the Roof right now. Check? 11. You should do more than believe that. You should probably know that. There seems to be some distortion going on. I'm doing that thing with the wolfman where I'm miming a lasso and pulling him closer to me to dance closer. Oh god, you're going to kill me?! Saving throw? Not at disadvantage? Natural 20. Natural 20. Wow! I throw my white man's overbite back on. It's just me and some instruments now. You have to come get me. Strength or athletics? Saving or check? Ten. Am I okay? I instinctually start freaking Grog. Dry hump dancing. Oh, what? I was dancing. It was amazing. There were lights. Wow. That was amazing. Can we get those weapons, somehow? The musical weapons. I guess we can't get them, can we? We'll flip a coin, right, Grog? Disadvantage. One. Matt, did my Countercharm help at all? But did you need it? Hey, I did it right! It didn't help? I still was charmed. That's not good. Hello. We come in peace. We mean you no harm. If we've tread into your territory, we will exit immediately, and we apologize for offending you or your gods. We seek passage through this marshland to what lies beyond it. We are searching for-- The Shademirk bog. It's a source of great evil that's been corrupting this plane and ours. I'm not tasty. A new iPad for no reason? This is so exciting. Yes, that's right. A favor to you? Well, we would be happy to help if we can. We are here to do good, anyway. We've already done some. We conquered the devastating campsite of Soradun the Happy, and we're up to doing more tasks like that, if it would help. If you are not powerful enough to conquer them, how would we have a chance? That is true. We probably do. We made quick work of the camp. It was a proud moment for us, one that will be storied for generations. Where can we find this site? The lights? I think we'll take the deal. Happy to enter into this contract with you. No problem. Is there a timetable to this? Do we have to do this now? Can we do this on the way out of the Feywild? Do we have your word that we have completely safe passage? We don't have to worry about any other sort of monsters getting us in our sleep on the way there? How many total are there? We can probably take them. We could probably kill them all. I'm just throwing that out there. I could probably convince them to destroy it themselves. I'm more inclined to turn around and fight these lions and tigers and bears, oh my! Because pixies, who knows? I'm okay with at least going to do some recon. But there are lots of them, and they're fast and invisible. Help? From whom? Oh, just her? Reading. After two and half more, I have about four and a half. Like doghouse size? Are they made out of toadstools? We're doing stealth checks? Are we adding plus ten? Five. Yeah. I don't want to go near this place. We should either talk to them, or run away right now. To break a piece of the circle. I don't think she would ever get close to it. They have some sort of shield up. Tell me this, Vex, Vax. People with high perception. Where are the animal men? Are they watching us right now? I think they're out there somewhere. Can't you go underground and pop up? What we could do, Grog and I could run back, I could cut him over the eye, and say It was horrible. It was quite a fight, but we won. If they block it with their magical little crystals all over the place, then they'll also know we're here and they will attack us. Wait, can you still tree-bamf us out of harm's way if we needed to? I don't have the mansion. I haven't slept in days. If we do Hallucinatory Terrain and it fails, the pixies will straight-up attack us. Everything here has attacked us. We have to get the animal men here to see it, or else it isn't worth it. I will buy into this idea if we have a plan for when the pixies are about to literally attack us five minutes from now. Wait, where are we running? Towards the what? We're leaving Kiki and just running? The pixies see it too, though. Strong eight. I rolled twice, because of disadvantage. Both were ones. I'm tired from reading. Wait. Are we trapped in here because we were deceitful to these wolf-men, or because the pixies are trapping everybody? We entered. So why are we trapped here? Because we lied? That is way better than our first idea, and yet still terrible. If I read for a few more hours first, sure. Okay. Looks like a seven. Nope, that's a one. It's either a one or a 20. And it was all a dream. What a shitty ending. Who knew? It was terribly hacky and derivative, and it read like Fifty Shades of Grey. What? Something different about me? I feel so interesting. It could be. Like a crazy grandma in the woods. Oh, I got sleep? Oh, I had two points of exhaustion? I thought it was just one. No, I already did it. Do I get spells back? Oh, sure. I love singing happy tunes. About fairies? How about I just sing a happy tune? I'll sing a song about myself. The best kind of songs. (singing) Cube, glorious cube! You really should try it. If you're in the mood, I won't even hide it. I'll pull down my trousers for any gal or dude, O cube, glorious cube, wonderful cube, magical cube! We might have straws. Not only did we run into them, but they forced us against our will to attempt to do you harm. I cut his eyebrow, and then he fucked himself by trying to smash through the barrier that I assume you created. We did everything in our power to protect you, and to not harm you. If our druid's spellcasting frightened you, we apologize, but we didn't know what else to do. And our gray stone friend? How can we buy his freedom? What? What do you mean? Wait. Earthbind? That's it, it's on. I call out to the main pixie Wait. What's your name? How many are there? We were put between a rock and hard place. And we had no choice. Really. It was a bad situation. If Grog is permanently corrupted, we know that we can download a fresh one from Backblaze.com. (laughter) We should've fought the fucking werewolves. 21 for me. I got sleep. I'll do Counterspell at level six. They're so far, and I don't know what they can do. Probably a lot. I'll step towards that tree in front of me, in front of the bear and the girl. That cluster of the pixies over there? I'll see if I can get three of them in a Fireball. If I can, the leader and the ones closest to the leader. But I don't know if I'm within range. Oh yeah, I have lots of charges, don't I? I haven't used them in a long time. I'll use two. A 4th-level spell, right? So it's 9d6. Range is 150 feet. Radius is 20 feet. Wait, they can do that, too? It's dead? Or it still might work after that? That one use, okay. Can I move any more, or am I all moved out? I'll inspire Keyleth. I'll turn to her and say (singing) It's been a hard fey's night, and you've got to unfreeze Grog. It's been a hard fey's night, because we've been fighting like a dog. Oh, boy. Advantage against magic. I don't know, bard shit. No it's not War Caster. It's something else. I probably didn't get it anyway, actually. Both rolls were shitty, and I only rolled a total of five on the better one. I'm a what? I'm a badger?! Gnome Cunning, Matt. This is our punishment for-- Yeah, that was a wisdom. It's just saves against magic for those three things. What happened? So wait, he's not a kitty cat? Shouldn't have gone in that cave, man. That's Grog, the red thing near you is Grog. It's a contested thing. Don't they want to Counterspell that? Defying statistics, one roll at a time. Oh my god, I was not expecting that, and therefore have no idea what I'll do. So there's pixies everywhere? Which one? Is there one behind me? You can't see one that I can see, actually. There's one around the tree. I wasn't expecting to move! I can't see the leader, right? Shit! Not ready for this! Shit! Okay, I'll turn around, and let's just hope that it works this time. I don't know! I wasn't expecting to move! How close am I to that one near the tree? Can I move to her? The closest one to me, and how close am I? Okay, I'm going to run to it, her, it, whatever, because I don't think they can-- well, maybe they can Counterspell this, but I'll do a Thunderwave. Yeah. At level two. I do have a sword, shit, I'm the worst at this! Shit, I'm the worst at this! I am going to be a beaver again. That's it. That's all I can do. Who's alive still? I'll inspire... shit, I'm failing. I'll inspire Vax. The girl! I don't want to inspire him. I want to inspire her. Vex, the girl. I'll say (singing) Vex is natural, Vex is fun! Vex is good when she's one-on-one. I don't know. I was a badger! I don't know what's been going on. You're fast and slow. You've got some inspiration, lady. I was right to inspire her after all. Someone's got to live! Are you calling for the fucking werewolves? Do I see any of them? Shit. I'm going to run as far as I can into the open and see if I can see any of them, while I'm yelling Where are they? Behind that tree? You mean behind Grog and stuff? Do I have a clear shot? Without killing my friends? With a Lightning Bolt. Well, then I won't do that. I'll cast Bigby's Hand at level seven and punch into that. Just a big old punch. Pummeling hand. Punching hand. 25. 8d8? I don't even have any. 45. Is that all the pixies? I got nothing left. That was my action and bonus. We called because our plan worked perfectly, and we were able to fulfill your deal to the letter, as we had always intended. I think I'm still at disadvantage. With disadvantage, it's a 30. I'm okay with 30. We'll never know. Keyleth, do you need help? You can't do it to two people at the same time? Sorry, Grog. Probably. Don't use any of your lower-level spells. I'm ready. I've eaten a lot of things today. Grog, care to do the honors? Should we loot the mini city? They're tiny thimbles full of nothing! 17 for me. Everyone was bad, including us, and we lived. That's it. I would love to. I used my 7th-level spell to kill a pixie. Maybe we can sleep in the treetops, where Lord Ukurat sleeps. We'll give him Garmelie if we have to. No show Thursday!
