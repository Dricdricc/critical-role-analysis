Are we in sync? Once again, I hope people can hear. Marvel Puzzle Quest is an awesomely addictive role playing puzzle game where Marvel's fearless superheroes come to life! You can download it now on the iTunes, the Google Play, the Amazon App Store, and the Steam. And now, a rare 5-star Spider-man has arrived in Marvel Puzzle Quest just in time for Spider-man Homecoming, the movie. You can recruit Spidey and play in two new boss missions featuring the Sinister Six. Face the Vulture, or recruit him as a supervillain for your team. Now, to celebrate the awesomeness that is Marvel Puzzle Quest, I have another one of my famous puzzles for Taliesin. Which of the following is an actual enemy from the game Marvel Puzzle Quest, and which is the name of an actual movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Hitman! That's an enemy. Brawler! No. Timecop! Century Fighter! Game enemy. Kickboxer! Bloodsport! Cyborg! That is also a Jean-Claude Van Damme. I'll skip a couple of these. Okay. Defender! Actual enemy from the game. The Expendables! Double Impact! JCVD! (laughter) Okay. And one more for bonus. Killing Machine. That's a trick; it's a Dolph Lundgren movie. Marvel Puzzle Quest! Marvel Puzzle Quest. Hey, that's good news! Laura, is something wrong with your head? Yay! Pacific Daylight Time. When we're in daylight savings time, it's DT. PST is when we're not in daylight savings. Yes, your mic is whack. He has more than one nipple, but less than five. (laughter) Can't hear Ashley at all. Liam is totally overpowering. I love it We'll find out! Is that you, Liam? Microdermabrasion. Oh god. We're going to go see Sarenrae, right? Sorry, robot Liam! Oh. We're not in a rush, right? 20 minutes won't kill us. Yeah, well hey. I'm no expert on the religious arts, but we have this eye of doom with us. Should we really be bringing this into a holy place of goodness? But what if it knows where we are and can somehow get an advantage and kill Sarenrae or something? I don't know. Is it still in the box? Can you shake the box and make sure there's something still in there? Don't open the box! Just shake it. Probably, yes. We love you, too. Just to be clear-- I was just about to ask, was that well-thought-out speech inspirational? Me and Grog got shot a few times. But I can use some hit dice. Yes. Walk towards the busty lady. And as always, I'll enjoy the rear. Pikey-poo. Pikey-pants. You had a religious thing and talked to your god, right? You talked to Sarenrae briefly, right? Did she invite you or all of us? Do you want to walk solo for ten minutes and see if you are, solo, getting any closer? Bunch of cockroaches when you turn on the light. Just Pike? Can we hear her? What is she doing that we're not doing? Her hair is partially blue. Maybe we should dye our hair blue, as well. Oh. I'm a believer. Can I try? All right. Yeah. I'm going to clutch my symbol of Sarenrae and I'm going to close my eyes and I'm going to see if anything happens. I'm going to go towards it. Maybe you guys have to believe. So poetic. Yes. Maybe. Well, we can tell you that he is awful, evil, pure evil incarnate, and he wants to be a god. You? You heard? I'm new at praying. I'm sorry for all the cursing at first. I had a lot of emotions, and I didn't know if anyone was listening. Apologies, but you heard me at night? Wow. You won't tell anybody, will you? Because some of that is personal stuff. How will we know if he's a god or not? Yes, time is of the essence. We should go right away. Might be souls? No. Well, let's just go. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, let's just go in. It's just light. New Yikes. Oh, a nod. Check in our weapons. Yeah. (hesitant noises) Will we get it back? Don't look at it, though. It'll turn you super evil, and you'll rip out your eye. How's that fruit? You want to steal the doors? Oh, we can't hear Liam. Look how far we've come, guys. (laughter) I did. I do that most weeks. Ooh! You mean I can-- oh, sorry. (laughter) Well, we gave it to-- Oh, we do? Could you guys turn them up? We can't hear them at all. Only if it can help us destroy Vecna. Right now? Wait! I'm going to to turn her into a red dragon. True Polymorph. Yes. Are you going to allow that? Are you talking about hers or the dragon's? Can she do like a wing thing? Do you have legendary-- To us? Oh god. Her name is Vex, and she is greedy and mean sometimes, and she can steal a lot. She's a little bit not the greatest person, but her flaws highlight everything that is right about her, which is she does all these things to protect her friends and her family. She would give her life for any of us and for anyone who was truly in need. And she's not perfect, but she's the most perfect of all of us. What? Betrothed? The Prime Trammel. Natural 20. It's a real good map. (singing) We are the champions. Live, in person. Find out how tall Travis really is.
