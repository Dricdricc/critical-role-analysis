Hey guys. Backblaze is a great service. (laughter) Guys, no shit, I just installed it yesterday on my home computer. It's currently backing up right now. It's an online file backup system for all your stuff. Your documents, your media, your Critical Role fanart, your videos of Scanlan singing things. There's no gimmicks or additional charges, it's just five dollars a month, and! You don't want to go to Backblaze.com, you want to go to backblaze.com/criticalrole, where you can get a fully-featured 15-day trial. 15 days, free! If you like it, keep getting it, pay five bucks a month, that's nothing. Or if you don't, whatever, it doesn't bother me. But it's only for Critters, and also if you go to backblaze.com/criticalrole right now, you'll see pictures of us, quotes from us. It's actually really cute. And I am such a supporter of these guys that I even wrote a song for them. It's very short. Okay. (singing) I'm backing up in Backblaze of glory! Take me now, download the truth. I'm backing up-- okay, that's it. (cheering) Tiny Vax. Tiny Vax. I got 12. Starting off right. Or just crush us. Yeah, not great. 15. 12. Oi. So I'm in a beast. As we all know, intestines are my favoured terrain-- (laughter) So I held up that rod, clicked it, and then it was pulled out of the body pretty close to where I am right now. When it went, did I see air? Did I see daylight, when it went out of there? It's a cut. Got it. And when it went out, I didn't see any daylight or anything. Just disappeared. Okay. Oh boy. I don't know, I got nothing. All right, I'll just try something and we'll see if it works and then I'll try something else next time. I won't die in one round, right? I'm going to Polymorph into a Tri-- not-a-ceratops. Into a small, poisonous snake. And I'm going to go straight into that wound. I'm going into the wound. With a swim speed of 30! But I don't know if it's swimming, it's more squeezing. Sure, man. This is a strong snake. Natural one. (laughter) (bink) Going well, guys! Oh yeah! Sure, I'll take a bite. 14 plus-- I have no idea. Hey! That's a 19. That doesn't hit. What do I roll? Guys, we knocked it down a point! Ooh! Seven. And it is considered grappled. Okay. Plan A, cross it off the list. (laughter) I don't think he has very many. I think he's dead. Oh god! Oh no, but wait, I took damage last round, too. Hey, I'm still a snake! (laughter) I'm going to drop the snake. Snake was a try and fail. I drop the snake, try to get that little bubble of air (gasps), and I'll fucking cast Bigby's Hand. Can he move at all? Okay. I would like to fist the wound. Jam it, find a finger and-- how you like that? This wound will never heal. So would it be a forceful hand? 12?! Yes! This is so embarrassing! Wow! (laughter) Wow! Okay! I have movement, right? I can't move anywhere! I have climbing stuff with me. Can I move my arms at all? I would like to take out a grappling hook and grab onto the inside lining of the stomach. Nope! Six! I can't do anything! It's great. These dragons are hard to kill! What about Grog? For my bonus action, I'm going to fist the dragon again! Just going to jam it in there! 20! Great! Before the wound closes. I'm going to jump in the hole. Dexterity saving throw. 18! Oh god, I'm outside the dragon?! (screams) Shit! Is he flying? Does he stay still? What does he do? He can fly?! Not as fast as the dragon. God. Okay! Hand can't do anything else, right? You're not going to let me cast another spell, probably. Oh shit! Wait, I see Grog? I'm holding onto the hand? The Hand can't do anything else. Shit. I just got out of the dragon. I don't know what's going on. I didn't even know we were flying. I'm just going to shoot a Lightning Bolt at him. Yeah. It's my spell. It's not through the Hand Cone, I assume. 18. 26. I guess so. Distance between me and them? What's the range of-- shit. Vax will? Is anyone higher than me? And he's not flying or anything, is he? Wow. This didn't go well. Okay. Yeah! I'm going to drop Bigby's-- 60 feet is not plummeting speed? I can't catch up to them as they fall? All right. Because Grog is over me, right? I'll try to catch him then. Shit, wait. Wait. Shit. Vax is below me, though. It's a Sophie's Choice. Yeah, I would go for Grog if he's above me, with the hand. Hi, friend. Shit. We've got to go to Vax. I'll start moving us slowly down, I guess. Then-- fuck. I can't see the dragon anymore, right? Yeah, concentration. Yep. I mean, I can make Grog deaf so he won't hear us die. (laughter) I got Grog. Fuck. Okay. I'm going to drop Bigby's Hand and Polymorph Grog into an eagle. Holding on to him! His brain is just geometry. And I just yell at him, dive, motherfucker, dive! I hope I can hold on! There's nothing to grab onto, is there? Luckily, I have a grappling hook. (dink dink dink) Oh no! It's worth it, it's worth it! You'll be fine. What's that? 60 points. Of Jor-El damage. (laughter) Is he single? Do you know how to play this game? Sorry. You're still an eagle. Grog, do you want to say something? All right, all right. I'll drop the form. I'll drop the form. How did you survive? You sound like an excellent addition to our team, then. We knew that. Yeah, we could use more of those. I hate to tell you this, but Kevdak is gone. Your whole herd may have perished fighting this same dragon. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, heal us and let's keep going. Quickly. How long has it been, a minute? Two minutes? We've got to move. We have eagles. Should we mist form it there? Can we do that? But you'd need to know a tree that's there. The temporary hit points never go back up, right? Today? Yes, but the dragon is injured now. Not all the way. Let's go. Oh, a mile up. Sure. But one is just for Grog, right? That seems like our fastest option. What's the other option? A short rest and then we bamf. Let's do that. We've also dealt so much damage to it. I fisted through it! What are we going to do today with Chris Perkins? Talk, or go fucking kill a dragon? Well, no, half of the people hop on an eagle. I'm in back? Oh, that's right, he's a little one. I don't know what that means. Does anyone need more healing? Are we okay? All right, let's hurry. Pretty cool sound effects 17. All right, let's do this. Do you need any of his stomach bile to help you scry? Does that help? Does that help? What do you want to do? He's asleep. Okay. We're going in the small hole or the big hole? It's a dead end? Jesus. This ain't going to be good. Shale, would you like to lead the way? I don't think you should be planning for your own death! It might explode?! She's not dead yet! We're not going to divvy up her stuff! That's bad luck! Maybe we should just kill her now and take the stuff. Thank you, Shale. Let's try to live. We're just going to go in. I'm going to come. Wait, is that the way in? My Gloves of Swimming and Climbing, are those attuned items? I'll put on my Gloves of Swimming and Climbing, which I got two years ago. I don't know what they do. Oh, great! 16. Big what? Oh, Shale. You got a trap up there, friend? Rocks? Hey Keyleth, you should go. There are rocks. You could do something with rocks-- Yeah, I know. Go up there with Shale. Shale's a rock. Go. We're going to die! Oi! I'm here now. Sorry. I thought that the rock people could handle it. 11 on arcana. This is old magic. (laughter) Can't you just melt the rocks, Keyleth? It looks like a rock. Melt it! It sort of has that old smell to it. Dispel that magic! See? Rocks! I told you! Okay. Let's go through the new hole. Alone? He's not usually little. (laughter) Has it been a minute yet? I got an eight. Shale, do you have any gold teeth or hidden savings accounts that we should also know about? Can I use Cutting Words to buff my roll? But not to-- That seems right, yeah. All right. 18. I should know this. Got it. It just happens. All right, I will use Cutting Words to reduce the damage. My cutting words are, "Your lower intestine smells like shit!" (laughter) A ten? Shit roll. Three! Including me, with my acid armor? Shit. Matt, did it also negate my disadvantage from Cutting Words, on the save? Balls. So that's dead, too? Does he use the legendary action before he fails? So it kills that too? Nice. No, my thing's dead too. He double-fucked us. When I die, I'm coming back as a character named Vix. I can't see him, right? Balls. I can see Vex, right? And Shale? Oh, shit. I can't do much without seeing him. Oh, here's what I will do I'll start by inspiring Shale. I will just step out and sing, (singing) And I will always buff you! And then I will pick a place and cast Stinking Cloud. No! Oh well, it's too late, I already said it. Can I have a pointer? Well, I'll just come over. Right here. 20. There's no more cloud of insects, yeah? Is there any way to avoid it? Move up to where Kiki is or anything? All right, I'll do that. I'll move up to where Kiki is. 17. Oh, Percy! Didn't notice your bald spot there. Sure. Makes you sick. You're not in the cloud. You have inspiration, if you want to use it. Gets to spend his entire turn coughing. Spends his entire turn. Does Trinket get an attack? Inspiration? Ah! Great. I'll take it. I'm sure he is. Can I use Cutting Words? All right. Oh?! All right, I'll do that. That's a four, so. Oh! That's not going to be good for him. Jesus, it's not dead yet? 20. Great. I've got my Stinking Cloud, still. I would like to move the Stinking Cloud. Oh! No, I can't do that. You can move a Stinking Cloud? Eh, it's fine. I don't want the Stinking Cloud to move. All right, he's right on us, he's got a legendary action. This is not good. Okay, I will reintroduce him to Bigby's Hand, (singing) Bigby's Hand! And I'm going to use it as an-- Ugh, so weak! Interposing Hand. It will block him. It's a talk-to-the-hand move. Wait, just moving? It can still attack? Oh. But it won't block an attack. So in that case, I'll just attack with it. I'm going to try to finger it right in the hole that I came out of before. He's the Bigby and the dike! What do I roll? d20? Oh! 27. Oh! With advantage? 27. It's just ten. 4d8 plus what? That's it, ten. Yes. If I move, he'll kill me, so I won't. Instead, I will-- where's Vax? Way over there?! Jesus. Who can I inspire? I guess I'll inspire good old Shale again. You don't need inspiration, you're fine! This is an old lady! I'll turn to Shale and say, I don't normally do this, but I find you so attractive! For an old lady! I can't! With your eyes-- eye? Eye so beautiful! So twinkling when it looks at me! I just want you to hold me in your arm tonight! (laughter) No! Yes, I've had sex, Shale! I have a daughter. Oh my god. Wait, what? Oi, Matt. My Bigby's is concentration, so that cloud's gone, by the way. Did you shoot it in the back? It's not a spell, right? A spell, Matt? No, it's not! I'm going to say, you leave when Burt Reynolds says you can fucking leave! And I will Bigby's Hand, and I will bring him back down, because I get a spell on his retreat. No, I get a full spell action. It's my lore feature. I get to cast a brand new fucking spell when he lifts off. College of Lore. If he retreats, I get to cast a spell. This is the exact same thing that happened last time. Oh, no, it's a War Caster feature. I will grapple him and pull him back down. It's a roll-off! Oh my god. This is a critical roll. That's a two. Seven! My armor, does that do anything? It's too big to fit in its own house. 13? I thought that said 93. Add seven more. Then add three. You have inspiration! Goddamn it! You're useless! You can heal my hand. Is that close? Don't do it. You can go through the acid. Moderate? I will inspire Grog with a little ditty that I like to call, Who Let the Grogs Out? Who let the Grogs out? I can try a different one, if you'd like. And I will pick him up, with his blessing. And throw him at the dragon. Or, you know, send him. You want to go up to his head? All right, yeah. He's going up top. He's only got 400 hit points left. Release the hounds. Yeah! That helped. What, me? Oh! Well, okay. I didn't know that. I will try something else then. I will send-- shit. I will send my Lightning Bolt. Can I see any part of him that's not inhabited by one of my allies? Right in the heart? I'm going to shoot him right through the heart with lightning. Yeah, that saves. I don't know that song, I don't know what that is. I don't know that song. 24, so just 12. Greater. I feel like we need to retire the dice. I guess I should do a Cutting Words, just to help a little bit. Probably 60, 30? Is he further than that? Damn it. So sexy! Oh, god. Shale jumps into acid. He's a little boy! Yeah, Quall it up. Well, all the gold that we can definitely prove came from Westruun, we'll bring back. With Westruun markings. Who? The Herd? I thought the Herd's-- Okay. We'll divvy it up later. You're a tiny pack of assholes right now. Okay. He's learned! There can be whatever you want.
