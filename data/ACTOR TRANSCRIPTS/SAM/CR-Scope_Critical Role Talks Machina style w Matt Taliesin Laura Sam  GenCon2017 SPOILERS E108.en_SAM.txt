I wrote that. Laura doesn't have a mic, but that's okay. That was amazing. I feel bad for the three people who aren't going. [laughter] It's so beautiful! In the Critical Role Live show tonight, you can expect to see accidental second base between Scanlan and Vax. You will see Cirque du Soleil-style trampoline stunts. You will see technical difficulties. You will see a Marisha inspirational leader speech about Macklemore's best song. Any other teases, Brian? Deep down, has your relationship changed with the Raven Queen? "Oh hello. It's nice to meet you." The next intro should be all of us doing various forms of cock lightning. Just come walking out of a room (explosion sound). [inaudible] cross the streams. In character. (as Tary) Doty, take this down. I have an idea for a hat that holds two bottles of aerated wine with a tube into my mouth so that I could always be lubricated. Also, put this down just as a note. A 56k baud dial-up modem.

[cheers, applause] It puts a lot of pressure on me. I will be running a one-shot in a week and a half. [cheers, applause] This next cosplay is so good. [cheers, applause] AUDIENCE
