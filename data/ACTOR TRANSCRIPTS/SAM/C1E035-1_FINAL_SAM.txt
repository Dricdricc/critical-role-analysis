A lot of classic rock! That's true. (laughs) It's not me! No, it's really not. Bahn mi, the Vietnamese sandwich that you can get in many places? Ang Lee! Or as long as Matt doesn't kill us all. I'm modeling one right now! It's lovely. The fabric is soft. It fits snugly and warmly... but not too warm. I think... I would pay 50 dollars for a sweater like this. It keeps my poops nice and snug. It's got two pockets for two poops. I will do that if you request. Ashley, we can see the sparkle on your eyes is messing with the cameras. Can you also wear something over your eyes? So, headphones and also cover your eyes. You're going to wake up for that? On what it originally was, Jesus Crit. (laughter) And now we're getting it back to Jesus Crit. (laughter) Yeah. Of course. It's got to be, right? You don't get scurvy? Because of technology, and also the story. Pike, no! No, Pike! Also, the battery died on the computer. All the traps that we found. You're checking for traps? You're holding two ladies. Oh boy. We do. Wait, so who's at zero health? We have potions, now. We're out of the magic-- Oh no, she might die. All right. I'll give you my greater heal. No, I'll take this one. I want you to have my greater healing potion. It would mean so much to me if you would take it, drink. No problem. If Pike were here, I'd give it to her, but... She's not, so. You're pretty cool, too. 4d4 plus four. Hey, as a thank you for that. What about that gun? Just let me hold it! That's what you think. My pickpocket fingers are faster than you could ever imagine. I'll take that. Does it look cool? It's the magic. Oh, thank god. No, we're okay. Everything's okay. Thank Sarenrae you're back. We did that a bit while you were gone, but yes. Wait, is she alive? Did you check her? Dirty rags? Do you have medicine skills? No wait, don't. You'll kill her. Blindfold her! Shit! (laughter) Oh that's good! That's your sister, Percy! Oh! Negative two strength, right. Can I check my history memory banks to see if I know anything about the Whispered One or if that jogs any memory? Religion check? Well, that's not good. 20. No. Oh. He's gone! Where is he? It was all tongue in my ear the whole time! (laughter) Who wanted to be a god. And his name was Vecna, and they called him the Whispered One. That's all I remember, he tried to achieve great power, and I don't know if he was successful or not. Wait, Percy, you're going to shoot an unarmed woman? Don't shoot an unarmed woman. Who's he talking to? I will Mage Hand to remove the gag from her. I pick up the Pepperbox off the floor to give it to him, and I try to sneak out a bullet. I don't know that! Three! Plus two! Plus two. I back away from it. Kick it off away to the corner. Oh, it's on the floor right there. You were talking to something out there. What was it? I was very scared. I'm a little man! Who were you talking to? Are you going to kill me with it? (laughter) Here's what I know. Here's what I know. Vecna is possibly, maybe on the loose, maybe coming back. We know that this ritual has been started, and we don't know whether killing her is going to end it or not. So I propose that we start leaving right away. Matt, fly to New York to whisper in her ear. (laughter) Well, this one's called "Secrets and Lies!" This one's called just (whisper noises). He whispers to you all the time. (laughter) Remember, these shirts are available online at geekandsundry.com! Oh shit. You don't need to yell at us, Percy. We're just trying to help you. I don't think he's rational. Unbeam-say! We got a guy with a hammer. We're fine. You know what we have? We have fucking Pike. As everyone's drawing their weapons, I shout, maybe we should check and make sure it won't kill him if we kill it. 20. Did the arrows hit? They impacted? Okay. How tall is the tunnel? Okay. No? Okay. Precious little I can do. I will Lightning Bolt it. Ooh, I'm right next to it. All right. I will turn around and I will, I will Lightning Bolt it, yes. Lightning. Shit. (stammers) I will not move and instead I will inspire Percy. And I'll say, you feel good in this motherfucker! Your whole hood in this motherfucker! (laughs) That's it. (laughter) Orthax? MARISHA and I hired them to get rid of some termites in my house, once. Natural 20. On the first roll. I'm going to use Cutting Words to try to dodge out of the way. I'm going to say, you gonna fail that attack, so you better sit your ass on back, because I ain't no hollaback gnome, I ain't no hollaback gnome. d10. Three? So that, what does that do? It lowers his attack by three. It's 17. Damn it. That's a reaction? Into the wall? What the fuck, Grog, you just tried to kill me! Yes! Are you okay? I'm going to just call out to everybody, the thing seems to want Percy. Should we surround him? Just hit the whole wall. That's a 33. And the glowing off of our bodies. Get this shit off me! I say to Keyleth, get this shit off me. I don't want it to see me. Please. And then I will walk to the other side of Percy. We don't see the thing, right? No, but isn't it on me now? I walk out of it. We don't see the thing, right? Yeah. There's not much we can do without seeing our enemy, right? I'll just hold my turn? Is that a thing? Can I do that? I can say to Grog, Grog? You're sure you want to-- are you okay? You're good? All right. There's precious little I can do, so I will viciously mock it. (laughter) Through the Hand Cone, I will say, don't you know smoking is the number one cause of cancer and emphysema and will shorten your life by an estimated ten to 20 years? It's not cool, and you shouldn't do it. I'm BS-ing! Five points. And it has disadvantage on what? Oh shit. Okay. Gnome, Common. That's it. (laughter) Marked? Is it a charm effect? Damn it. Is it a fear effect? Damn it! On my roll, do I still get a bonus? No, but do I get my bonus action as part of my move, or no? Got it. That's a lot of d6. That's my Pike. (quietly) 12? That's 26. 14. And with beauty. You're going to throw up? I hold her hair back. That's okay. It's okay. Oh, that's a good move! 17. Pike? Oh, whispers! Whispers and whispers. Ashley, Matt is whispering in Taliesin's ear, just so you know. Yes. Wait, who's that? Who's going? Oh, that's Cassandra? We're okay with her running away? Scanlan's up? Do I have my wits about me? Oh, that's nice. Okay. I charge at it! No. (laughter) I have so little that I can do. As my bonus action, I will-- as my movement, I (sighs) tragically, flip the gun to Percy. No, the good gun. In the-- what's that Martin Lawrence movie? Bad Boys. They did it all in slow motion. Just throw the gun. Okay. As a bonus action, I will Healing Word Pike. Did she heal herself okay? Okay, I will Healing Word her, and I'll sing, believe it or not, you're made mostly of air. I never thought you could feel so free. Just at one. d4 plus five. Lame. Eight. Eight, honey. I love you. Oh! I love it. And then for my move, my action, my whatever you call it... I've got fucking nothing, man! I say to the beast, to the whatever it is, I say, and another thing! Your smoking encourages minors to smoke and creates an aura that makes going to restaurants not pleasant and it's just horrible. It makes your clothes stink. It's terrible. So another Vicious Mockery. Eight. Take that! Yes. Oh shit! I'm sure it'll be fine. Maybe she's learned the error of her ways. Chase her? Do I hear that? I hear it. You have inspiration. She's dead. You killed her. Times two? Or maybe it's always going to be there, haunting us.
