I don't really have anything prepared this week, guys. Instead, I thought I'd tell you a little story about something that happened to a friend of mine. Her name is Jessie. We grew up together in a small town. When she went away to college, she didn't want to go because she was a homebody. Her parents said, just go, have fun, you'll love it. She got to college. A couple of weeks into it, she and her roommate went out at night. She came home. She fell asleep. They were a little tipsy. She woke up in the middle of the night to this scratching sound and she couldn't figure out what it was. She just went back to sleep. Got up again, heard another scratching sound. What was it? She couldn't figure it out. She went back to sleep. The next morning, she woke up. Her roommate, the skin had been ripped off of her body, and the cat that they shared had also been turned essentially inside out. And on the wall in the blood of her roommate was written Use code criticalrole for $3 off. That's a lot of blood, and it's a lot of savings for the new Loot Crate, whose theme is horror. Channel your best Final Girl with items from The Walking Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, and the story I just told. Hey, should we open them up, guys? This is definitely horror. Let's open them and see what horror items we have? Look, it's Dark Knight. What's the pin? The pin says Loot Year. Oh, it's like Goodyear. But in all seriousness, Loot Crate is a big supporter of the show, so we want to support them. Go online, go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole. Sign up, get subscriptions for all of your friends and all of your dead friends who died tragically in a horror. (stage whispering) They're our fucking sponsors! Leave the box on the goddamn table! Is it about your friend who went to college? (chuckles) We have no idea. Yeah. I don't think so. She took his designs. We're all extremely emotional, but we need to move quickly if we're going to do anything. We need to collect all the guns. There's only one, so yes, that's the one. I don't think we can. He's just a shadow, isn't he? Orthax? It's in the gun? Well, that didn't kill it, did it? Just got it out of the gun. We have an airship. Maybe it can take us somewhere with trees. Wait, does that send one of us back to her? One living soul holding a dead soul? Going through? Yes. No disrespect, he's an object right now. So if one of used the stone, holding him, it'd be carrying him like a sword. He'd go through. Okay. 16, 18. Shame, intelligence check. I could, but-- Oh my god. Why don't we ask Kynan what it is? Maybe he's seen her use it. Yeah, open that little box. TRAVIS. I open the latch box. Or she opens the latch box. We all simultaneously tear it open. Should I take it out and take a look? Yeah, could be. I'll open it and look it over. Not good. Do I add Jack of All Trades? Is that a thing now? 16. I am proficient in this. 14. A Gate scroll. The scroll allows an arcane caster to use an action to cast the 9th-level spell Gate. Am I an arcane caster? Also, I might not be able to do it because it says level nine. If the spell is higher than the level the caster can use, then they must make a spellcasting ability check to succeed. But it's a waste of a 9th-level spell? Or we could use this to go save our friend. Or it could bring a healer to us right now. I don't know how death magic works. I don't know if eight hours makes this huge difference. All right. But we have to collect things first. We need all the guns. Even the broken ones. If any one finds any of these, they could be retrofitted or used for evil in the future and that's something that Percy would not want. Ever. I need to go find our dog. He probably won't be able to be found, but he could be somewhere. And I feel like we should look in this cavern, don't you think? Someone has to stay with him. 1d12. I can keep him, and he can help me look for the dog. Does he make one, too? 30. Just scratch him behind his ear. Sorry! Maybe we'll do more next time. We sleep. Yeah, it's going to be a great night. We'll hang out, tell stories about Percy, cry a bunch. Yeah, you're right. All right. What time is it? How long have we been awake? Should we let the airship know so they don't keep hovering? We have flares. But we don't-- I guess. Is there anything we need from them? They can bring the arm back to Ank'Harel. Weren't we supposed to bring her arm back to Ank'Harel? We'll mail it? Okay. We're not there. How'd it go with Damon? I knew it! Aren't we not supposed to tell anybody about Whitestone? Didn't we have some blood pact, don't ever say the word Whitestone? Also, isn't it invisible? Great. All right, well, maybe they'll find it, anyway. Sure. I'll house it up. Sounds good. Yeah. We're still a team. Well, we're not going to let him sleep alone. We'll put him on a table, and we'll all sleep around him on the floor. It'll be super weird. Well, we're recovered. How'd you guys sleep? Everyone sleep okay? Not great. Got to find a tree. Where we going? LAURA and Okay. That's where Pike is, right? In the castle? And that's where she was last seen? Resurrection? What does that do? Does it just bring him back? I don't know, Vex. We could save 500 gold. What was that, Ash? No, Pike, no! Or we could buy him a better tombstone if we had the extra money! In the gun? Go to Percy? Check? Just a check? 11. How'd you do that, Pikey? Well, you were dead, weren't you? Could we throw the gun into the little hole under Whitestone Castle? There is acid. We could do the same exact thing. On what? Can you do that to an object? I would like to inspire her, at least. Is that something that will help? I think. Matt, would I inspire Pike or Percy? I see. All right. I'll inspire Pike, then. I assume she's going to bring something to the ritual, right? I assume? I inspire her the only way I know how, which is being an ass. So I'll inspire her with a shitty limerick. I know a gunman with a white coif-a Who acted evil and had a bad cough-a. He learned that someone Had possessed his big gun, So I threw that shit in the lava. (laughter) Didn't you have that thing that brings your god to help once a day? He's so quiet. We should just let him sleep. Pike, you're in a temple! Don't curse. But-- Ashley, you did it! You have one job, Ashley! One job! It's like that little doll hand on SNL. He's awake! He's alive! Ow! Your home. Our home. Deader than dead. She's torn asunder. We have parts of her. Two? I thought one was a fake. Okay. All right. That's a weird request when you just wake up. Well, you spent last night on a table, which is much beneath a man of your station. Yeah. I wanted to use a Gate spell to save you instantly, but everyone else in the group said no. They wanted to save it for something else. (laughter) It's a hard yes I'm expecting. (laughter) What do we have? Get it identified. Does it have to be a magic user to wear it? Groggy? Percy? But you already have a Vestige. No, Groggy. So does this go to Percy? That's pretty cool. Didn't he give us something to give to them? Did we do that? Yes, we gave them what you told us to. They told us you weren't potty-trained until you were six. Is that true? You arm wrestle for it. Haste? No. Which one's that? What does that do? Hey, you read Marquesan. The language of Marquet. Marquesian. I got this book, found this book in this shitty casino office. It's written in Marquesian. Oh. It's a porno. I can't read it, though. How will I learn? Are there? Oh, ooh? I don't think so. Ix-nay on the ice-spay. There are authorities around. Grog, if someone hears you talking about this shit, you could be in deep trouble. Jarett. It was great! (quietly) Do you spice? We had a great time! (quietly) Do you spice, boss? Do you want to spice something? I like the way you look. (laughter) For the pair. It was worth it to see the smile on your face. I'll keep this bag, if that's all right with you. I've grown quite accustomed to the stuff. It's really quite lovely. (singing) Letters! We got letters! How did they get through the invisible wall? Could be a seal. It's in Marquesian. What's the thing? Does it say something? Yes. We do have to start planning for the next leg of our journey. She froze, she froze in a weird position. (laughter) I am currently holding Gilmore's severed head in my hands, right? Blood spilled, dripping-- Percy died, yeah. Percy died. We need to resurrect him. Ready? One, two, three. (yelling) Wise. Do we need to talk about our plans, or are we waiting for Percy for that? I'll pull Jarett aside real quick, if that's all right. Well, while she reads, I pull Jarett aside and I say Listen, I know you've had legal troubles before in your homeland, but we're buddy-buddy with the leader now. In fact, I have this symbol. They gave me this symbol. This is the gods' honest truth, man. This is a real deal. This is diplomatic immunity, man. I can get you off! We met them in their palace, and we're pretty tight now, so I bet I could get you free and clear. Will you do something for me? You're a man who knows things, knows how to get things. I was a little disappointed with the samplings in your home. I was wondering if around here, you couldn't find me a little something-something. A little pick-me-up? A little ride? A little dipsy doodle? (laughter) But you know people who know people. I'm going to get you cleared of murder, man! What were those words? The thirst feels? There's way too many S's in what you just said! Yes. Some thuude? I don't know what you're saying! Spell it! Suude. What is that? Is that place? Is that a person? I don't! I don't know it at all! I am confused, too! This will not affect our professional relationship one bit. You have my word. There you go! It's okay. Just try your best. I believe in you. (lisping) You're the best. No. I'm going to clear your name, man. I'm your ticket to freedom. Thank you. That would make me so happy. It's weirdly Patrick Rothfuss's voice, though. (laughter) Why? He didn't mention you, did he? Well, I'm sure it was a joke, friend. Well, you should not have taken that note. Well, aren't we all anticipating dying? The fact is, we all might die at any point, and it would be terrible, and we should enjoy every day that we have together. Reaching around? (laughter) You're dead. You're essentially a dead person. That's ominous. Yeah, let's chug and go. He hasn't even said anything yet. Ooh, whispers. Hello. I am Loot Crate. Please buy me. Oh, hold on, Matt's coming behind. Ashley, I think you should move to Los Angeles. Ashley, we all died. It's just you now. You versus the dragons. We're like seven detectives. He was just playing to his character's intelligence.
