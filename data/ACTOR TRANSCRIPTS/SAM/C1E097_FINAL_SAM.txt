I didn't write an end to the bit. That's it. It's over. Yay! And scene. Thank you, guys. Is someone wearing? Jesus, this got dark really fast. You could fly down. Some of us own flying brooms. It's 1,000. Or the rock? Goldfish are not magnetically attracted to water. They still just fall. Oh no. Oh boy. What does that mean? That's below her total hit points! Unrevivable death? Wait! Vex! I gave you a coin! You broke the seal! Because she hit as the goldfish! Sure. I better go check on them. I'll dive off the cliff. (laughter) She's more blood than person. What? Oh! Oh. I'm glad I gave it to you, then. Ooh. Oh, how many? 300! Are you addicted to death now? Have we healed her up a bit? I can do a healing draught for her. Healing draught. It's colorless and odorless. Just drink it. It'll make you feel better. I rolled on my iPhone. 37. It's 8d8. Did I die? I think I died. In the water, I think I died. Think I died. Let's go home. Burn the wagon. (laughter) You have to learn humor, Doty. Sarcasm. Is it night? What should we do? We can go check on the Slayer's Cake? Yeah. Did we have someone running it? Do we have someone? Okay. We should hire someone. Yeah. Have you any management experience? Yes. Let's see, but not make any promises, because someone who's never run any-- We should have a proper interview. Check references. True, but I had the advantage of being able to buy my way in. I'm open to it. Not JB? In front of the bakery? It's been a day. Madam, what's your name? And you would like a job at our bakery? May we try it? Quick sidebar. This is better than anything we've ever made. Yes. It was really good. Wait. What? You think it's poisoned? I ate it. I ate the whole thing in one bite. Am I going to die? Am I going to die? Did you just kill me? It's really good. The whispers. Have you never had a whisper? Oh my god, everybody's firsts tonight. Backblaze, ladies and gentlemen. backblaze.com/criticalrole to get two weeks free or something. Yeah, two weeks. Oh, you want to do the infomercial bit again? Have you worked anywhere else? Do you have anyone in the community who could vouch for your character and trustworthiness? Oh, Keeper Yennen! We know him! I think, right? We know him? Where did he go, again? Pike, if you were dead set on JB taking over the business-- Why don't while we're gone you could help Hilda. Hilda? Hilda. You could just help out, but maybe leave her in charge? She seems like a-- What if he's alive and in peril, do we tell her that? We're going to lose our only employee. Really? We have to go help someone? We just met this person! Do we know what she was talking about, by the way? We could go on vacation again! Ignore the blood all over her body. Athen? I'm just throwing this out there. If that was a ploy to get a higher salary, I'm not biting. I'm just saying, she could be very cunning. She didn't give us a social security, we don't have an I-9. There's nothing. She could be Raishan. Still going to talk to Yennen? Yeah, of course. What did you find out? LAURA and And you say she sits in a room by herself eating pastries? Let's watch her work for a day. See how it goes. High school biology. (whispers) What's an oracle arrow? So you only have one of these? Oh, you're fine. Whoa! It shouldn't work. Weirdly, the arrow hits and kills Keyleth. Don't do that! This is a long whisper. Oh man, this is not what we normally get. By the way, just a little insight, what we normally get on the whispers is, "From what you can tell, it seems totally normal." And then that's about it. As far as you can tell he thinks he's telling the truth. Whoa, her mind is blown. She's drawing a weird alien creature. Big head, big eyes, small body. She speaks Arrival language now. Oh yeah, I'm asleep. At night?! She's in the room. She's hitched! She was going to come see us. I'm currently-- Doty is brushing my teeth. I've seen it in the Player's Handbook. Oh, from the inside of the castle. Sure. Doty is brushing my teeth. I'm getting my rogue character ready. She probably bought those cream puffs and didn't even bake them herself! Train traveling... You can certainly try. He does. Fuck you, chat! Doty! Doty. I'm having a dream again. Doty? Oh boy. Ugh. Hello? You there, driver person! Hello? What's going on? Where are you taking me? Have I won a lottery of some sort? Oh no. Did my father pay you to do this? He is. I will pay you whatever he has promised you, double, if you let me go right now. I will write you a check and I will guarantee it with the name Taryon Darrington. Damn it. (sighs) Money is so good. Not when you don't have it. I have armor. I have jewels that are worth a lot. Please, you don't want to do this. Please. Just let it go and no one will get hurt. I respect her so much. (sighs) I don't ask people names, friend. (laughs) Matt's doing something. Oh Matt, I forgot to tell you. When I left home, I left a large eternal flame burning on my keep's roof. Is that okay? Oh, thank you! (screams) I lift my head up. What's going on? Pretty calm fight music, Matt. Can I stand up yet? Am I still tied up? I will, yeah. (panting) What took you people so long? I was on a horse for what felt like days! No! You know me better than that! Please tell me that someone brought my toothbrush. Please don't smell it. I'm very embarrassed. I went to sleep. I don't know what this is! I mean. She's taking me. She's paid by my father, probably. And what, you work for my father? On a regular basis? Oh, that's nearly nothing. I'm worth far more than that. I am. So cool. Well, we should bind her and search her. Make sure she's not holding any weapons or anything. I respect that, but I did get a bruise right here from the horse falling over, so I'm not totally okay. I left. Yes. I left of my own accord. They knew I was leaving. Well, this is just some paid shithead, so I don't think we should kill her or anything like that. I want to take her belongings and send her on her way. That's a separate question, isn't it? We're very close-- proximity, I mean. Seems foolish not to at least go have it out with him. This is unacceptable behavior, I think, in any relationship. This is not cool, right? Well, yes, there's that, too. You want her to get paid? She kidnapped me! What?! She committed a crime against me. I don't want her to get money! I'm sorry. I guess I was raised with a different appreciation for money, but Pike, your family came in and robbed us and you gave them a bunch of gold. Then this person kidnapped me, and you want to give her 5,000 gold. You think he'll be guilted? I live in the city. I'll just walk in! It's my house! Yes! I'm Taryon fucking Darrington. People shake when they see me walking down the street here. Who? I abstain! With an attitude! I would like an apology. And as to the amount that was promised, do you think that was a fair amount? I accept your apology. And as I said, I admire your diligence and faith to your contract. You don't get any of your belongings back! Is that all right? You don't get any of your magical belongings back! I want it. Yeah. But we'll, I guess, walk in together and you can present me to my father. This seems so stupid, but sure, I'll go along with it. Fine. And then we can send her to look after that little creep that you're always talking about. That's gross. That's disgusting. Yeah, let's go talk to my dad and get this settled, and then we'll figure out your next assignment or whatever. Yes. Thank you. These are my friends. They should be treated with respect. No, the town was never the problem. It's a fine place to grow up. Sure. Yeah, oi? For what? No, you're right. We can't punish people who are just hired to do a job. It's fine. Yes, I hired you. And now, we're so close! Here, let's go to my dad's house, but... I need to make an entrance. I'll be on broom. Yes. Behind me. And I should be front and center. You guys can flank-- Yes, thank you. Is this a trick question? There's everything. Most things are special about me. What? There's vampires here? No? Wait, what? I mean, sure? They're the bluest of blue. My town here, it doesn't have very many high hills, but still, stay on the ground, will you? Thank you. Tell the master of the house that we've arrived. Yes, excellent to see you, too. You've been keeping the grounds quite nice. Papa. You'll wait for us outside the grounds, and we'll give you your next assignment soon. Are you? You sent that woman to kidnap me. She bound and gagged me and threw me on the back of a horse. That's how you brought me home? I am literally the least hard man to find. I tell everyone my name, I wear a gold helmet, and I walk around talking about myself. Yes, I was. I was living a new life, as I told you I would. I was finding myself and becoming someone. Well, I was in danger for much of my time away, but that's not a bad thing, sometimes. Becoming an adventurer or whatever I am now, it wasn't supposed to be easy. It was supposed to be hard, and it was, and it had risks. But along the way, I did much, and I stand before you now as a different man than who left. One who has been through a lot and knows the dangers of the world, but is also a survivor. You know, when I left, I told you I was going to prove myself to you. That I would bring you back stories of my exploits and show you what kind of a man I really was. And I wrote a lot of them down in a book, but I don't think I want to show it to you, because I don't think you deserve to see it. You never supported me as a child, and you don't now. Financially, yes, but not as a father. And the things I did while I was away-- well, the book is a diary now. It's for me, not for you. Yes, I know. That's all you seem to care about. It's not all that matters. I know that I carry your blood and that means a lot to you. And what is that? I don't believe you. Where's the money? Where's the family money? It's all right. They're with me. I don't understand. The way we lived, the way you talked, made it seem like there was endless money, forever. My lack of respect? What happened? How did you ruin us like this? In the Myriad? I'm having trouble wrapping my head around this. You're saying everything I've lived has all been built on this deal with this shady group? You're a criminal? You're just a criminal. We didn't build anything as a family! But Papa, you never told me any of this. You were cold to us, and you told us a bare minimum of what you did and how you ran things. I didn't know any of this. How would I? And now I have to fix it for you by marrying some girl? That's still a marriage. No, it's not! I have to be here, I have to be with her. I have to live in her castle or she in mine. (sighs) Listen, I've learned a lot from these people over the last year or so. And one thing I've learned is that you are who you are whether you have a lot of money or not. And I don't have that much anymore and I'm still okay with that. And it's not because of the things I own, it's because of the deeds that I do. You've done some bad deeds in your life, and it sounds like you've done them to preserve our family and preserve our legacy, but that's not a reason to do them. Yes, I'm sure that's true. And I assume I'm somehow complicit in this. I'll have to think about this. What have you done to our name? Do people know of this? And if I marry this girl, it will just all go away? They're far too big. And if I say no and they take all of our possessions and our estate, everything, what then? We're ruined. How could you do this to us? You never told us that. You always talked about bloodlines and legacies and the Darrington name. But you never told us you were proud. You never comforted us. You never cared what I wanted to do or who I wanted to be. I'm cursed with this name now, Darrington. You've sullied our name by enforcing these taxes and just being an asshole to everyone around our whole city, and now I have to live with it or marry this girl to save it. Listen, I'm sorry I left, and I'm sorry I took all of that gold. I did not know it was everything. But what you're asking me is-- I'll need to think. I'm sorry. Yes, you can. I'm going to go see Mother and Sister. Might my friends stay here the night? Grumpy Lillian? Oh, okay. Well, good to see you. Have a good afternoon. Thank you. It's good to see you again. Yes, let's leave the room. He's acting differently than I recall. It's been a while. I'm not used to seeing him like this, and honestly, I don't know how to take it. It seems like I have to. LAURA and Grog says I do. Marriage. He was a weird character choice. I don't know. I thought a meager amount. 50,000 gold. Thank you. Tell her she did good. No. I'm not cool with my sister. She's not that great. I guess. I suppose she knows about this. Yes, that's right. She was being groomed as the heir to the family, and I was being shut out. My mother is here somewhere, too. She's pretty quiet. I guess talk to them, but we can't go after the Myriad; they're powerful and dark. No, he offered services, and look where it got him. We could go talk to them, but I don't see how that's going to change anything. Gross. No. I like being besties with you. I don't want some rando. Lydia? Why not? Everything he is, is his status, though. This place, where he lives, his servants. If he's got nothing, then he's just... he'll die. That is maybe true, but listen. I've been working on this for a year, and I'm starting to get really nervous. I'm down to my last few bits of gold, and I don't know how that would feel to run out. No, I'm not thrifty. Yes, money would have solved this. I assume I would be a fine husband. I feel like I'd be okay. Yes, it's true. I'd assume they are not safe here. We'd have to convince them to leave, or protect them somehow, or make a deal to at least protect them in poverty. All right. Well, a quick stop to talk to my sister, possibly, and then let's go at least investigate this contact. I appreciate you all being here for me. I'm sorry. I didn't realize that this was going to happen and I don't want-- if you fellows want to go back and just continue on, I can solve this. I'll try. Maybe I should sleep with bells on. Percy, can you make me some? All right, I'll walk through the place and look for sis. (singing) Me, neither! Mercer! No, Grog jumped off a roof and died. Yeah, you do. Yeah, for some of it I had. No, I think I had their names written down.
