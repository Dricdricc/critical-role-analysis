The theme this month is Sam. (laughter) I love toys. I love socks. I love shirts. I love posters. I love collectibles. I love pins. I love boxes. And I love deals. And you can get all of those things in combination if you get a subscription to Loot Crate. If you use lootcrate.com/-- that's a forward slash-- CriticalRole, you will be instantly shown a showcase of all the Loot Crate offerings. And you'll get three, not one, not two, a little less than four, but $3 off a monthly subscription. Well, that's not as good. (laughter) I am the best at advertising. (laughter) (clears throat) Goodbye, Loot Crate. (laughter) Oh! I'm wearing a Loot Crate t-shirt right now. It fits. It makes me look strong and handsome. Sure, I did really good. Wait a second, pilot chair? What did we do to deserve that? Would this be magic, Matt? If it's not magic, then I have an 11. You gave Vex'ahlia a title in your Whitestone kingdom. She was the Duchess of some hut. Did he write something down? The binder that Vex carries is much, much better. Wait, I think I can help. I'm going to cast Modify Memory on Percy. I can help you remember, Percy. Just look into my eyes. Look into my eyes. (laughter) With the cone. I want this to work. Level seven. I can change any memory. Ah, what was it called? What was your title called? There's nothing on this piece of paper! (laughter) Jesus Christ. Baroness of what? Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt. Oh my god. When did we leave? How many days has it been? I can only modify ten minutes of time. So I can't build the whole story up. All right. All right, I don't know. I'm going to make him remember that we landed in the Feywild together as a group. It was a beautiful field filled with naked nymphs and fey creatures that all came to him and gave him a wonderful full-body massage. Vex saw him and he did not want anyone to know about this moment that he had. So in a fit of panic, he gave her something, anything, a title. A title to make her keep her confidence. The title was Lady Vex'ahlia, the Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Gray Hut. (laughter) She agreed to keep his secret and he had a wonderful time before his memory fades. To be honest, my memory is foggy as well. Pike was there. I don't know, it's a bit foggy, but a few days. We're in Whitestone? All right, let's go. You fought bravely. And often. You wielded your weapon strongly and proudly, and had many definite physical encounters, and were never frozen. And showed your power and defended us to the best of your ability. Okay, good. 17. (laughter) You were great. That's true. Oh, that's right. A little statue of a dog that might be magical. An onyx statue of a dog. I've seen it, I can reach in there. Doesn't know what onyx is. He's picturing-- So wait, it's insta-dog? And then what does it do? Can it fight? And what happens if it gets killed? What's your intelligence? Oh my goodness. Oh, it's a talking dog? It can see invisibility? I like this dog. But we need to know the magic word. Oh, we know the word already? Can you teach us how to say that in Elvish? Vo'el'el'ena? Vo'el'la'la'la. Let's get the dog out here. Why did you taste the wind? What happened to you? Wyvern guard. Eastward. Maybe not. We'll find another way to alert them. Send out the dog. I don't know. Nine. Maybe they can't get through this. Where are we telling people to go? That can hold 30, 40 people? Okay, under the castle, yeah. Do you remember the Feywild? Okay. Just making sure. Pike stats! That was not fun. I'm sorry! I'm sorry, you didn't get to kill anything. I'm sorry. Oh, you did! You did, you killed the one thing. Okay, good. Lesson learned. Maybe... well... Actually, I don't know. I don't know. Greater Restoration kills Modify Memory. And that I did it? Fuck. Don't thank us. Thank Shaun Gilmore. Intelligence of six. I hope you know that I was only trying to improve your life with a wonderful happy memory, and it was mostly true. Don't go too high. We don't know where the thing is. No. Absolutely not. (high-pitched) Why would you bring attention to us?! It can't fly for infinity? So this was not the group that had set off from Emon. Here, here's the map. We're up here. This is the group that was coming from Emon. These guys came from somewhere over here? Where's Draconia? If this is the United States, we're in Maine. Emon is LA. Wait, there's other objects that we haven't-- One werewolf has vowed allegiance to us. Yes. Your former pals. Yes. There's a candle-maker who might help out. I would put him in the strong maybe category as well. But when the dragon came here just now, they saw nothing, correct? Is there a way that we can spread false rumors that the city of Whitestone has been magically moved to another plane or something? Some way of getting that word to Draconia or I don't-- Oh you're right, the white one is a hunter, it's primal. Hates others. You're right. So the white one's like Predator? Wait a second, you just said no one knew we were here, none of them knew we were here. They just attacked here. And we just got back here. Because Gilmore was scrying on them. Got it. Not because we have a leak. I'm going to blame Shaun. Sorry! (chuckles) They do? We know this? Who was there and lived? Besides us? Ooh, that was a Luck. Seeker Asum. Oh! Well I've got some of the great swag that you can get in a Loot Crate. Why this shirt came in one last week. You go to LootCrate.com/CriticalRole to see your selection and then if you sign up, you get three dollars off the first month, which is a really good deal! I'm talking to Seeker Asum! He's a big fanboy. This booze is okay, but Grog, I could really use the finest wine I've ever had. Good idea. We don't weigh very much. It's not in Draconia? It's in the Plane of Fire? Correct. Where's Ank'Harel? Where you grew up, Gilmore? You're Marquatian? What about the endless maze of the Abyss? That's another place that we're supposed to go. I've got a map. It's like the Pacific Ocean. No. Draconia's across the Atlantic Ocean in France. Whisper, the blade. How do we do that? Are we guerrillas? I'm not going to volunteer myself as a slave to the dragon. I'm considering it. Does the barrier block sound and visuals? And is there any way that we can help you make this barrier more permanent and stronger? We're going inside it. In the room where it happens? We'll just have to Seeker Asum that it happened? (laughter) Airship. Airship. Airship?! Wait, to go to where? Marquet? Hold on. Before we decide that Marquet is the thing. So we know where to find him to kill him. wE've killed dragons before. I like Grog's idea. Is there a way to explore that any further? Yes! Seeker Asum is great, but we're the best in the business. I wouldn't leave our plan A to someone not us. Have you been to Draconia? If there's any trees left. Grog is the best thinker. We can probably plan a ruse. White dragon loves the thrill of the hunt. I've seen the green dragon. Raishan? How big? I understand. I could do that. I could do something pretty close to that. Are you Tony Robbins? (laughter) At dawn. Raishan is the green. Here's the problem with goading Vorugal the white to find and kill Raishan the green. No one knows where Raishan the green is, including Vorugal. Because Raishan's the shapeshifter, and no one knows where she is, including Gilmore, who's been scrying for a week to try to find her. Why did he shatter them? He was pissed at the other dragons, maybe. What's the idea? We know what pushes their buttons. We can throw up some statues and cause some havoc, but if they have these orbs that communicate with each other, then the white can call Thordak and say Hey, what's up with these statues? And Thordak can say No, it's not me. We'll make t-shirts that say Team Vorugal. But we know that Thordak is a total asshole-- Sorry. (laughter) Between what and what? It's between what and who? Is this Tal'Dorei? So Marquet is Japan. Got it. Is this world round? Can we go the other way? Can't go the other way? But we could bamf there right now. And what would our mission be? Wait. What about, instead of dumping statues, we find these orbs? We find his lair, we find his orbs, and we call Thordak and we do a voice like Yo, Thordak! You're a dickhead! I'm going to come kill you! Or we just smash them. They don't know we're here. That's true. We have to rest. You have the best ideas. Lay it on me. Tomorrow. And we'll look like us, except vaguely like lizard people. First of all, the lizard army, is that different from wyverns? So they're just scaly creepers. I can do that. No, but I'll see them when we get there. We could be lizard people, for sure. (singing) We could be lizard people! He wants to go to Marquet to find some cloak that may or may not help us in a week. That's it. If we go, what is our mission? We can get 13 people out. That's it. We had a group of 50 goliaths, and they were all killed instantly. I would only want to go there if we had a distinct plan to disrupt or trick or steal. And I slice the dragon's throat! And I say, I am victorious! Smash the orbs. But I can get us a safe place to stay for the night, no matter where we are. Can you teleport today? Or are you done? So if we go to Draconia tonight, if we want to sleep in the mansion, we can't, because I changed his memory. So we would have to sleep out in the open as lizard people. That's where they live. Let's sleep. I need a young boy. (laughter) I have an Unseen Servant. Do you need a servant? I make an Unseen Servant for him. Command him as you see fit. I tip the Unseen Servant. Well? To Marquet or to Draconia? What's it going to be? Should we vote? Which is which? He's probably okay. Jarett. Our only friend in Draconia. Whitestone continental breakfast. Two eggs, rambling tirade. (laughter) All right, all in favor of going to Marquet to find a Vestige that will maybe give us some more power that we need to kill a dragon, say aye! TALIESIN and All in favor of going to Draconia, where we don't really have a great plan but I think we're going to go try to fuck up a dragon's lair and maybe rescue five people and probably die as lizard people, say aye. LAURA, TRAVIS, and Three to three. Let's do it. Wait, we're just doing one flip? No. What?! What about all the other numbers? Oh god! We could go there and there and back. Yep. In Draconia? You're talking about tonight? Go to the black dragon lair, then go to Draconia, then spend a night there. In Draconia? TALIESIN and But they could track us back here. And then they'd know where we are. Actually, can I just throw this out? The only thing that would detect us scrying is currently flying over the ocean. We can scry right now. To the giant's lair! To scry! You know what you know in Draconia? Do you know what you know in Draconia? You know Tiberius and you know his armor, and you know his objects and personal effects? That's true. but what do you know what is in Draconia? Do you know any of his friends or his family? Have we met his family? What about his little pet? That's true. We know of Lockheed. You're going to gamble on Tiberius? How many times can you scry? Start with Tiberius. No response? Does it? Okay. What about his father? Well, Lockheed would be with-- So you're burning your own spell slot. Thanks, Vex. We should do his dad. You just want to kill everybody. Can you see any trees? Someone has Feather Fall, right? No? Should you scry one more time, for the dad? Because best-case scenario, we're in a weird, snowy ravine with no civilization around. Yeah, we'll be far away. Seems like a good plan. But you said-- It's a little jolt. It's a little fall. It's fine. You told us your famous phrase all risk! That's what this is. All risk. That's what this is! We are doing all risk! I've never known you to be a coward, Grog. We can just leave really quick! She's got another teleport, yeah. We're going to climb up to the tree-- At the worst, this is a quick recon mission. We jump back in the tree, we come back. 15 minutes. They were far off in the distance! You got a fucking broom. I'm hopping on the broom. Pass Without a Trace? 20. Is Lockheed within range still? Can we see him? Six. Where's Lockheed? I see her doing this. I point to him, and I cast Message, and I say Lockheed! We're down here! Come down! It's us, your friends! I have Speak With Small Beasts... Fuck you! (laughter) What is a monster? Just grab him and put him in the bag of holding! He was teaching him "sit" and "play dead" and stuff. Should I make us lizard people? Can you look around for more trees that aren't so hard to get to in case we need to make a fast getaway? All right. Or is it all water? You want me to make us Draconians or lizard people? I don't think Grog can cower. Be a wussy. Draconians? I will cast Seeming on the party and make us all Draconians. Wasn't Tiberius a strange one? He was a strange one, right? Metallic, yeah? Like gray, silver? Bronze, silver, and gold then, I guess. Yeah, we'll do the Olympics. Which one was Tiberius? Do most of them have a tail? We all have tails. Mine's a little longer than the rest. (laughter) No! What do Draconians wear? Raw silk and tattered clothes, just rags, terrible gray things. Sure. We all have a single bruise. (laughter) You speak Draconic! (laughter) You're our leader, friend. Do we continue? I would not like to. I will join that insight check. We had a 50-50 chance! This was a great plan. I don't know what's going on. It's Draconian! I don't know what's happening. What? Is it going well? Disadvantage. Not good. Really? It's one of my better spells. All right, poof. We're back to normal. Let's kill them all. Is it Tooma? Just tell us when it's time to kill everybody. Just remember Vex, ticking time bomb here. We've got to get in, get out. We've got one day here. So we're going to go see Tooma, or we're going to chop down some fucking trees? I could make us all Draconian again without tails. Hi, yes. Grog doesn't, but we do. Grog was right! He's always right! Do you know where its lair is? Is it far? (gasps) Oh boy. What? Taliesin. You've got to do better than that. Try something like this You know, Matt's an asshole, but you know who's not? The good people at Loot Crate. Hey, you never told us what he whispered to you before. Oh boy. We definitely have plans. Ambush? Sorry? We were going to use this opportunity to find our way into its lair and find its weaknesses, and plan. The Frigid Doom. Was that opal? What should we disguise ourselves as? Okay, tiny is uncalled for, but I understand. The faces of your tribe, of your clan. All right. I can do Seeming one more time. All right. We've still got the mansion. Handicaps me a bit, but I will cast Seeming again on the party and do the same thing, except slightly different colors and slightly less tail. (laughter) My tail nub is slightly larger than the rest. It's a cube. It's a tail cube. Have we heard of Skork? Tooma, have you ever heard of a dragonborn named Gern Blanston? Us neither. Note every tree as we walk by. Yeah, dog! 14! That wasn't the golden snitch? No, it's a crate, Liam. Yes. A crate full of boxes. Box Crate, our best sponsor. Inside the boxes are tinier boxes. No, it's a Russian nesting doll of boxes and crates. Box-box, and then inside is a box-crate, and inside that is tiny-bag-crate. Liam! Do you want all those boxes? You get $3 off the first box of boxes. Crate-crate. Is it up? Is it down? Is it through? By the way, we've been in dragons' lairs before, and the lairs themselves do things, right? But when the dragon's not in them they don't do anything? I have an idea. Can I help? 28. Okay. Do we smash it? Do we use it to make a crank call? What do we do with it? Steal it? I could do a Vorugal voice and say Thordak, you're a cock! I could say Thordak, I'm in desperate need of pay! I guess you'll have to do that. What do we do? Do we break it so he can't communicate with the outside? That way when we kill him, he can't call for help. What did we say we would to do? I have a great idea for how to kill this fucker. Well, I have an idea. Tooma told us that they bring animals to hunt. We could be one of those animals and draw it to a certain spot. Where we kill it. With our army of fucking Draconians and our ice thing that we've shaped into some sort of a trap. Fire trap. Rock trap. Just us. Oh shit. I just did. I made a plan. It's an ambush plan. What do you mean, the dragons are at war? There's only two more dragons at that point. We killed three-fifths of them. What does that even mean? We've already attacked two dragons. There's been no war. Attack what? We have to kill them at some point. All right, so how do we use this orb to do that right now? That's why we came here! What does that mean? I can't do it anymore. LAURA and I used my last magic poo to look at my daughter. I need to know where she is. I need to know she's okay. Gilmore can maybe make me some more potion, but I haven't wanted to bother him about it because he's busy keeping a shield around Whitestone. Shit. I said it in an accent. We need to use this opportunity. We're never going to be in this dragon's lair again! This is it. Crack the thing. Set a trap. Burn it down. Yes, Grog, you're the best. I can pretend to be a beast. Galdric is the wolf, right? Can we carve in the lair "Thordak was here" or something? Got to go find us a beast and bring it here. We'll be here the whole time. Tooma. I have one more question about Gern Blanston. I raise the hand cone, and I cast Modify Memory on her. 21. I'm trying to change the moment that I said "Whitestone" into "Emon." Candles. Have you ever met a candle-maker? Was he on one of those stakes? His home doesn't really exist anymore. This is his place. For now, anyway. And then when we free this place, we can find a proper tomb for him. I turn around and say Goodbye, old friend. We'll come back and we'll fix this. Because this is... poppycock. Totally. Dick move. Oh god. What? It's a fun romp after the Feywild, a fun romp. $3 discount. We're next. (laughter)
