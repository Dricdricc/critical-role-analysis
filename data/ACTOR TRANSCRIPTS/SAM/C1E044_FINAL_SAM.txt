Are there Critters in Ireland? Egypt? Whoa, is that true? What's it called? What is it? What happens on the show? Is it just about optimizing your home Wi-Fi network? You're perfect for that. Matt, can I do one quick shoutout? My friend Mark Whitten has a DND-based webseries starting tomorrow called Rolling High, I think it's youtube/rollinghigh, check it out. What did you find again? Brass knuckles of some sort? And now we have them? Wait, where are we going? Marrowway Cove? What? MARY and He just raised his voice a little, that was the difference. Do you need me to stay with you? To help you? And nipples. What time of day is it right now? I feel good about my investigation, I have a keen eye. Let's do this. Not as good, but pretty good. 17. Have I rejoined her? Barnes and Noble-style? It wasn't kept in its neoprene sleeve. Get out your buyer's guide. Just kill him! Last name Pedobear. (laughter) You're married? What's up? What do you need? Sure. Whatever you need. I thought you were going to tell me a dirty joke, or something! When you say "come here," usually that's what that means! Oh. Well then, no! Try it on Vax. I'm going to use Minor Illusion to make a really shitty Vax. A really cruddy-looking Vax. Oh, shit. Too late. Killing horses? Let's go. Just do it. This is the same day as the monk fight? But our mist form will dissipate, so if we want to mist it, we should mist it now and check it out. Our good old Zahra is already down there looking. A dark force is coming out of Loch Anus. Oh, well why didn't you just say so? Throw things at them! Quick! Start eating a Tootsie Pop. Have we achieved our long rest yet? Wait, is it our guy? Oh, I'll-- nope. (laughs) Do I need my sleep still? Okay, I'll stay with you. So. I've seen you checking out some of the members of our little group, here. Listen, Vax doesn't fly that way, I don't think. I know you've been eyeing him pretty good. Vax. I'm just looking out for you, brother. He's not available for you. I see the way you've been flirting with him. It's adorable. Well, I'm a romantic, so I notice these things. He does. He has a flair-- it's not my thing, obviously. I go for the lady hookers. Yes, yes, but no, you have good taste in men. He's a dashing young rogue. Yes. Yes. They are. They really are. That's your keen eye at work! Can I give you a bit of advice? You know, you have to follow your heart, so if you do have feelings for the lad, you at least have to tell him. Even if he won't return them to you. Oh yes, what about? You are so in touch with those. Oh, yes? TMI, my friend. TMI-- Yeah, we have another two and a half hours on this watch. I think she just wants her brother to be happy, you know. Oh, well, you know. I think of like, a word, and then I try to think of a rhyme for it. Like, 'Kashaw', like, what could that be? That could be 'pshaw'! You know, something like that, I don't know, I'm working on that, I'm working on it. I'm a man of the world, I'm well-traveled, I'm cultured-- Rickshaw's a good one! Let me tell you, secret weapon. I sleep near Percy a lot and he rhymes in his sleep. It's the strangest thing. Here, I'll show you, I'll show you. I haven't a fear in the world! Sometimes it takes a while. It takes a while. See? It's amazing. Every time. Every time. I can make us all look like fish. I'll workshop that one. You? We'll all run in! How much water can you displace? Go, Keyleth. Go. It's a super muddy "ahnus." Are we just at the edge of the pond? But we haven't gotten to the part-- Hey, guys, you want a hand? So I will cast Bigby's Hand. And I will gently lift them up and cup them as I pull them up from the muck. Sure, sure, sure. What do you need me to lift? All right, let's scoop. We're scooping. I'm scooping. I go with Zahra. What do you want me to scoop, Zahra? Sure. Here it comes. Whee! Is that good or bad? 16. For a very small amount of time. Okay, I can make a wall behind us or something. I guess I'll just pack it with mud and rocks, right? I'm not a good builder! (laughter) 24. Yikes. Thank you for the idea. Ah, you must be so proud. What do you get for a one-year anniversary? Is it paper? Can you kill them? So do I. 30. Oh, wait. Darkvision? I'm going to go with Zahra. No, but I'm going to go with you, so I'll be able to report. Kash, are you sure you don't want to go with Vax? All right. Oi. Well-- Goo is rarely good. We should continue on to find out. This is something we all do. I don't know why, we don't need to do this. It's just a thing. You know what? I'm going to try it without. It might feel weird. (louder) Grog, can you hear me? Grog, can you hear me? See, it doesn't work that way. (laughter) Talking to Grog! I'm going to pull a Grog and taste it. We're all in the same tunnel now? On Vex's suggestion, I'm going to make an investigation check. 30. Kashaw. Watch this. (laughter) And how long a period from the blade swinging, to swinging back. Like a half a second? So someone needs to reach their little hand in there and click it. Shit! (laughter) Enhancement? Ooh, I will never say no to enhancement. I guess a little shortsword-y blade, I guess, to get in there? Or I have-- I have climbing gear, I have a cube. I have a flute. What can fit in there? Come on. I need these babies to play. Do you have any tools I can borrow? That shitty sword that you don't care about? Could I shove a blade in there and jam it, maybe? I'm going to use my Aberration Bane sword. Shortsword, or whatever it is. I have never used it. All right, I'm going to jam it in there. Sure. Okay, plus my dexterity, which is zero. So that's 13. With my finger? Thank you. Five. Thank you for the advantage, Keyleth. (laughing) Oh, Kashaw, you sweet-talker. (laughter) Don't worry, everyone! I've cleared the way. Wait, you can read bullshit? Oh, yeah, that makes sense. Doors. Jesus, don't fall. (high-pitched noise) 15. All right, I'll look. I've also got darkvision, so-- 12. Sort of curved to the back-- I could probably sketch it for you. Oh, let's just go in there. Check out the Geek and Sundry store for fantastic Critical Role-themed products and merchandise! There are shirts and posters for sale! They want to bite us? You can also make donations to our charities of choice-- Find links to those on Geek and Sundry. Oh, wow, the detail! Ooh! 17 for Scanlan. Is there light? Oh, they lit torches, right? Whoa. You got it. Vax! Did you see that? Amazing! Oh, sorry, I won't draw attention to it. Oh, shit. Deep Speech? I speak Common! And Gnomish! Jesus. Can it see me? I'm right under it. Okay. I'm going to attempt to use my Wand of Fire-- oh no, no, that's a bad idea. I'm going to use my Lightning Bolt! Lightning Bolt on it. Lightning Bolt. 'Cause I'm right under it, right? So it'll just go straight up. Okay. So I can roll for something? Yes, please. 30! Well, I assume it sees me now, but I'll slowly back away. Does it kill me while I move? And then I will turn to Zahra and I will sing to her to inspire her. I'll sing (sings) Zahra, a rainbow! Zahra, a sunrise! Zahra the moon to wear! That's not good enough, no, not good enough, not for Zahra! (laughter) That worked. (laughter) (laughing nervously) Oh shit, Kima just died. Yeah! Yeah, maybe it's soft and cushy! Is this a spell? Can I use Cutting Words on it? Oh, it just happens. Well, then, I'll just make my what, dexterity sa-- Hmm, yeah, great. Five? Yeah. Sure, sure, yeah. Yeah. Wait, we hear her say something, I mean, she's not underwater drowning or anything. Oh, wait, remember, Laura, you can move a little bit faster because you have 30 gold less than you did earlier. (laughter) With inspiration. Ooh! Yeah, yeah. What's behind there? Constitution this time? 20. Hold! Hold. He's 25 feet up? If I aim a Fireball right at the roof, will it hit any of us? 20-foot radius. I'll aim on the far side of the beholder. Yeah, just up from there. Well, I'll just try to get it as far away from Grog as I can. Okay! Wand of Fireballs, and I'll do it at fourth level. If I use my-- Does that go through the Handcone? The wand has-- ew, a DC of 15. Is he going to be affected? Okay. 30. So 15. If I move, he's going to hit me. I will inch away from the precipice? Let's see, who's going next-- I will inspire Percy with a song. I will sing (sings) And if we're talking Percy, you got a perfect gun, so put it on me and pull that trigger, if you shoot him right, you'll end his life, on and on and on-- (cheering) 17. Wow. Oh, good. I'm glad that we're all right next to a wall. Hi! Bye, guys. You're still attached to the thing? Maybe! I hoof it towards the altar as fast and as far as my-- Shit. That's as far as I can go? Can he see me? As a bonus action, can I move a couple more feet? (laughter) All right, I'll give it a shot. We'll see if he's looking at me. It doesn't look good, though. Wow, that's a tight angle. I'm going to cast Bigby's Hand. And I'm going to do something unorthodox that the DM is going to have to approve. Around Grog. And I would like to swing Grog like a hammer at the back of the thing. Yes. It's a goliath hammer! 23. Was that 26? Woo! And Bigby's dissipates, I assume. Oh! Okay. Great. I would like to use my bonus action to inspire, who's about to go-- Vex! Vex! Who's taking selfies of her-- I will inspire her with a limerick Friends, I don't mean to sound bitter / But a year ago, life was a shitter. / 'Til I picked up some dice / With some friends! It was nice! / And now, ah, I'm a Critter. (cheering) Oh, Jesus. Should've healed myself. I'm dead. That's 11, right? Kill him! How's this thing still alive? Keyleth, attack the monster, not the wall! Nice job, Thing. Oi! Look at the guy right behind you! Whoa! This could do it! Whoa, wait, what? Two? Wait? Huh? Bigby's Hand is not doing it, you're the one doing it! I'll use Bigby's Hand to catch some of the sinew and blood and-- I'm chugging a greater healing potion while I look around for any loot around the altar and around the dead bodies. Did you pee your underoos? Dead. Instant death. Did I find any loot in the bodies of the losers? The little guys? It's true. It's written down. It's true. Call whose attention forth? Who's she? Who's she? I will-- Oh, sure, I will let you do that. I just hand Vex 30 gold and say, sorry about before. Kash. I can assist, I've got Mage Hand as well. Matt, I just did an arcana check and got a 23; does that help us know anything at all? Okay. Let's take it! To Whitestone?
