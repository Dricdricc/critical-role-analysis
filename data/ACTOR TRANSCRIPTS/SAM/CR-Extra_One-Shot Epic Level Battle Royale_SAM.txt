Guys, for the sponsorship opportunity, I know that I have this habit of doing a bit, doing some comedy at the top of the show, and it's all funny and clever and brilliant and all that. But today, I'm just going to do it serious. This is a serious sponsor and they need our serious, unadulterated attention. So I'm just going to read the copy, I swear to god. Okay. Our sponsor tonight is Marvel Puzzle Quest. Recruit all your favorite Avengers, from Black Panther, Captain America, (fart noise) Iron Man, The Hulk (fart noise), Black Widow, and more!

(excessive fart noises) Mix and match to create the ultimate team of three, and battle it out in Match Three War! (squeaky fart) Marvel Puzzle Quest is available on iOS, Android, Amazon, and Steam. Download it now for free. (so many fart noises) I just read the copy! Can you tell me where we found them? The King of Egos. There are six pictures of me, plus me, so that's seven. Lucky seven. Wait a second. You're doing a story? I thought we were just going to kill each other! Oh, I feel better now. Like you need something else. Can I inspire myself on this roll? I forget, it's an ability check. I will inspire myself. One inspiration down. Wait, wait, that's too many. (laughter) Shit, I forget what Mythcarver does. (laughing) Everybody. Everybody but Kiki. Jesus! That's your wife! I don't know how to play this character anymore. I've totally forgotten everything I can do. I'm going to turn invisible. And I'm going to pick a direction to run in. I don't see anybody. I'm going to pick a random direction. That's right. I'm going to run to the right. Is this a door that I can get in? Currently a door? I'll run over that way. I only go 25 feet. Or 25 things. TALIESIN and And bonus action I can't dash, right, no? I don't know. I've never dashed! (laughter) Are we hearing things? Can we hear the crack of wood? Oh boy! Are we playing Battleship now? Are you sending him moves? Is this what's happening? My tremor sense hears her moving. How big is that thing? Is it taller than the roof? Nice! Just going to crack my knuckles then. Except for tremor sense. Okay. Shoot! I saw her. (to Marisha) I saw you! Let's see here, 25 feet gets me to either here or here, right? But I can't get somewhere where I can see her. As I walk, I will try that door, see if it opens. Does it open? Yeah. Then I'm going to keep going and get to here. You said 20! I thought you said I could get to either here or here! Okay, I will use my action to cast Minor Illusion and it's going to be Scanlan's voice coming from right here behind where she can't see, singing a little song. Minor Illusion I don't think is concentration, right? It just says one action. Oh, when you cast any spell. Ugh, shit, I always do this! Then I will save my action until I see someone, I guess. No! No, sorry Matt! Sorry! I'm new to this game! I'm going to use my action to dash, right? I get more movement! I go back here. Out of sight of her. Yes, yes, it's all happening. Do I make a stealth check or something? Okay. Does she have pinpoint accuracy or just know the general direction? She knows where I am? I've never seen someone so disappointed at stairs before. Your magic power is your wit. She cannot see me. Can I Counterspell that? Okay, I will Counterspell that at level four. It just happens? Constitution saving throw! First blood. 22. Great, that's good. Another 22. But your most powerful weapon is your wit, just like Liam! Why is this so stressful?! We already beat the bad guy! Yes you will! First blood! Yes. Oh, shit! All right, it's begun. You don't know. You don't know! Oh, are you? Ooh, first blood! Or whatever that substance is. I'm up? Okay, knowing where she is with my tremor sense and just having seen her walk through there-- I'm going to peek around the corner and I'm going to, even if it kills my Invisibility-- oh wait! First I'm going to bonus action heal myself. Healing Word. Level two, yeah. Why not. Ooh, four and a four! Okay, that's 14. I'm back up. For my action, I will start singing. (singing) If you want my body and you think I'm sexy, baby then start to dance! (normal) And I will cast Irresistible Dance on her. Through the Hand Cone, by the way. I can't even find it in the book. I can't find it in the book. Is it not in the book? Oh, she can only move. I'm going to use whatever movement I have to hide again behind this little-- Where are you going? She's pinned down, dude! We need you over here! Otto's Irresistible Dance. 22. I become an ancient brass dragon. True Polymorph is not a concentration spell, right? It just happens. So she would stop dancing? Then I'm not going to do that. Shit. Sorry, Matt, sorry. You have an ancient brass dragon at the ready?! Well, in that case, I will-- poo. I want to roast her! She's pinned down, man! We got her right now, guys, this is it! I will say, though the earrings, She's open, let's kill her. Trust me, I won't kill you if you get close. I'll lean out and Lightning Bolt her. Of course. No, I'm sensitive to the plight of women. I will do it in a gentle bow. 26. Do elementals maintain their damage level? If she goes back to stone, does it halve the damage that it had? Damn! If we're all over here, we can do it! She's there, man! I'm going to turn back behind there. In the distance, do we hear another door breaking? I'm single-handedly first blood-ing over here! I'm first blood-ing everybody! Yep! Dear Matt, check this box if you like me. Oh no. Yeah, what's that noise? Are there doors on that thing? Nice. I will Cutting Words this first shot. Are you adding these up? Because I'm not. I'm the wrong target! On top of what? I'm not adding your shit. How is it 41? It was 40 before. It's all good. This is how he wants to play it. Taliesin's been trying to do this for months. Yeah, I am. Mm, don't have lots of good options. Oh boy. Bonus action, 2nd-level Healing Word. Uh-huh, got to get back in the game. Five plus six, 11 points. Yeah. Let's see here. What to do? I need some healing. So. Shit. I've got to get away from Keyleth. I've got to get healed. I will Dimension Door to the opposite circular tower. Yes, behind it. That's my action. That's it. Do I see him? Does he see me? Okay. Like a matador? Pawn to rook four. Woodchuck to gray squirrel, woodchuck to gray squirrel. Five master D&D players! I tried the doorknob. I didn't really give it all the effort. You can't see Keyleth popping out of the-- I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself, at level one. It's three plus six, right? Great, awesome, nine more points, guys! I can see Grog. I could take a pot shot at him, but that would just kick the hornet's nest a bit. I could score eight points of damage on him and then die. I need to just heal. In that case, I will dominate Grog. Oh wait, shit, no, I can't do that. Is he worked up, is he raging, can I tell? Okay, forget that then. Forget it. I could put on my hat of disguise. (laughter) No, just so that you guys would think I'm a kindly old man who just walked onto the battlefield. If I use my bonus action Healing Word, to heal myself, can I also use my action to cast a higher level healing word on myself? Or is that-- Okay. Then I will cast Minor Image. Minor Illusion or whatever it's called. That only has 60-feet range, 30-feet range, 60-feet range? Shit. You know what, I'll do Major Image then. Fine. Fuck it. I'm going to do Major Image and it's going to sure look like Scanlan is just walking right out to the edge of the water right there. Not from there. He's just going to appear right there, he's going to come out from around that corner and look out like he's looking for a target. You have to shoot. I thought you said you were holding your action. Got it. Wait, for the tower? I thought you said "I'm holding an action until I see anyone." Okay. That's my action then. I'm done. Second question six inches soft. (laughter) Third question. Shaved. Wait. How the fuck did Grog get all the way over there?! That's amazing! That's true. If it's anything like Hide & Seek, you'd probably be like I really have to pee right now. I stuck my face out and I got 140 points of damage. He may not even be playing with us. Shit! Are you double poisoned? Yeah, I know! You have to see the people you're doing it to. I don't have a plan tonight. Bonus action Healing Word. Do I know where that goes? No. I don't know how those things work. I heard a bunch of smashing kitty-corner to me and I haven't seen anything else. Cool. What? That sounds great. I'm going to have Major Image Scanlan ice skate across the water in a jaunty way. He's walking on water, as I've always wanted to do. MARISHA and He's not a real thing. He can do anything. He's going to walk across the water going, "Hey! Over here! Hey!" While he's creating that distraction, I'm going to peek around and see if I see anything around the tower. Yeah. Anything? 15. Okay, I duck back. That's it, yeah. Naturally sparkling. You would be just dumb enough to do that. (sings with background music) (sings with background music) Man, Liam's RP is so good tonight! The last move, though, was so goth! Hi guys, Scanlan Shorthalt here. Thanks. It's lofty. Knowing where Percy is, I'm going to peek around the corner. Sure, but I kind of know he's up there. And I heard booms distantly over here. Feeling a red-hot anger towards Percy for shooting me-- And also gaming out that there's people over here, right centered on this spot I'm going to cast Anti-Gravity. Reverse Gravity. 50-foot radius. Keyleth for sure. Are they always attached? Nice! 100 feet up. Because you said the top is like 90 feet up, so I want her to go all the way up to the ceiling. I'll duck back behind the thing. And I will say drat, it didn't work on Percy. I'll use my bonus action to say Percy, I wasn't aiming at you! Shit! He doesn't hear anything! Pretty good! Oh Jesus! Bonus action Healing Word. Yep. I just sang a little song to myself. Okay, so for all who care, I'm up to 63. And I'm going to look at Keyleth, say into my earring, Friends, let's go fucking kill Vax. At least find him! This is not a fair fight without him! And then I will Dimension Door to the opposite corner again. Oh yeah. Whose turn? Hello! Bye-bye! Has he hit the anti-gravity field yet? I didn't know you were even there! Unintended consequences. Don't worry, I'll get rid of it on the next round-- oh wait. You'll plummet to your death. Can you only send him moves in gif form? Sure, sure. I'm going to do a Mr. Bean followed by a-- He could be somewhere over there. LIAM and Matt, could I see her, by the way, when she flew over and down like that? My turn? Jesus Christ, I don't know what to do. I only see Keyleth. I've only seen Keyleth this whole game! Do I see Grog up there, flying? Okay, I will peek around the corner. I kind of know where Keyleth is. I kind of know where Grog is. No one has responded to my text message of "Let's go find Vax." Bonus action Healing Word. Oh wait, wrong one. Jesus, I don't know what to do. I'm not going to go after Keyleth without backup. You don't speak English! All right. So I'm going to announce to everyone, I am going to search for Vax! Hold your fire! And I'll walk, I guess, around this thing. Can I get around it without--? Actually, no, I don't know where he is at all. Yeah. All right. I'm going to start going this way. I'll use dash to keep going. Really, no one's near the lightning towers? I guess I could have dropped Anti-Gravity. I forgot. You want me to get rid of it? I forgot, I'm sorry! Can I do it now, Matt? No. It's fine. You just gave up? For legitimately six seconds. Are you jumping across the river? Does he have to leave the ground to jump across? For what? We're all flying now. Water bed. I'm still walking across this room as fast as my little feets can carry me. And I'm kind of out of low-level spells at this point. But it won't be a bonus action anymore, will it? Can I do a bonus action at a higher level if I don't do a spell for my action? Ugh. Wow. That is insane. I will not do that yet. No, I'll do that. I'm so down. Okay. Oh yeah. Level three. So that heals me another 12 points. Yeah man. That's my bonus action. Then I'll use my action to sneak out and look-- Oh wait! I can get out and around back here, right? I'll do that. And when I get out the door I'm looking around. What do I see? I see everybody floating in the air? This is crazy. Do I let them go? I need help finding Vax, but I don't even know if they're on my side right now! They haven't responded to my text! Okay, then I'm going to release the gravity. That's first blood. (laughter) He's sending you a gif right now of Dramatic Chipmunk. We've got a rogue. There's no door! Is it a refrigerator? But it can't go through stone. Scanlan's up. Scanlan's going to peek around the corner. I'm going to throw in a Firebolt right in the front door. Wand of Fireballs. Two charges. That's 9d6. 15. I got him, guys! He's real rough! Bonus action, I'm going to put on Gloves of Swim/Climb. I think I got them in Pathfinder. I don't know what they are. Great. That's it. First blood. 28! We got a little Liam there! Liam talked! Yeah, man. Demise! That's nice! It's a good throw. I can? I'm going to dash right towards Keyleth. No, just run. How far away am I? So more than 30? Fuck you! (laughter) Goddamn it. Goddamn it! All right, I mean I'll just-- Sorry, changing my mind, seeing if this works. What is the save? Wisdom? She's so wise! She's not immune to charm, though. I've already charmed her once. Yeah, fuck it. One more thing to check, sorry. This is a brand new spell, I've never used it! What's the range? It's 30 feet, great. I will Dominate Person. Yeah, it's not going to work because she's super wise, but I'll try. 22. It's fine. As my bonus action I will say to her That spell was an inspiration and we're still on the same team, right? Okay, me too. What's up? Who's next? Hey! He was a blur. Came over, shot at you, and left. Oh shit! Counterspell level six! Ah wait, the range is 30 feet. Oh, okay. Sorry. Probably, yeah. Yeah, It says range 60, it's used as a reaction. Wait, what? No. Counterspell is ten plus the level, wait, what? Got it. So that's 13 plus six is 19. Yeah. I go Verily you are-- bad person! We're both making mistakes! I know. I do too. We're making stupid mistakes because we're so anxious. We really are. What lighting? That was Keyleth's turn. Why would Colville do this to us? He's a kind and gentle lord. Wow. All this work destroyed. I run after Keyleth and I say Wait I forgot! Feeblemind. I will use Wish to cast Feeblemind on her. To impossible to defeat spells? (groaning) 11. She can still fucking Wild Shape every turn. Yes. I'll duck somewhere so she can't see me. You said Feeblemind has a super long range, right? I didn't move at all. I'm going to move back over this way. He's checking if you do it before the roll or not. I am calling it now Keyleth still wins. How does she know where I am?! What's that even mean? Not overwhelmed, just whelmed. A strength saving throw. Okay. These aren't good. 14. Can I Cutting Words? No, right? Jesus! You can do that? You can hit, grab, and pull all on one action? But like, Bigby's Hand can either hit or grab, not hit and grab and pull. And she's pulling me away? So her intelligence and charisma went to one, but her wisdom still exists? Okay. Good to know. All right. Can I use verbally-based spells? Okay. Then I will cast underwater and cast Dimension Door. We just asked that. And I will, since I don't know where I am, I will bamf to a place that I do know, which is-- where would I go? Let's go to the room across the water over there. Right there, near the PacMan teleporter. Yeah. Yeah, closer to the water's edge, but yes. How many? He sees me?! Through all that fucking rubble? I'm dead. I hold up my gun and say, Need one, motherfucker? I'm going to Cutting Words that with my little taunt and reduce it by-- Oh, that's true. Never mind. Well, then I'll Cutting Words the damage. You can do that, right? Okay. Well, then you hit. They're all bad hits. Massive hit. It's going to have to be a really good roll. Nope. Oh, it's a d12! I've been doing d8s this whole time! One. Ow! Ow! What?! He can hold three attacks? And one attack is three? He's going to shoot me eight times! Sure, yeah. I will Cutting Words. Top of the round, I get my reaction back. Then I'm dead. On me? Aw. 17. You know what I would have done on the third attack? First blood. You did a lot of nothing damage to both of them and then hid. You'll never win, Vax! Scanlan from the grave! 11. You're going to heal me. The new campaign will be all texts. I'm prone. I get half! Who will tell my story? TALIESIN and You did? First blood! I cast Slowly Decompose. Aww! Weirdly, taking away all of Keyleth's intelligence has made her a more effective fighter. It's so fixed. Can't be done! Don't you get it? The math's not there! You have to deliver more than 200 points of damage in a single round to kill her! You can't do it without us! The math is not there! First! Blood! And Grog just suffocated. Oh, each time and she hit him twice? A little?! You. Can't. Win! I'm jamming! We jamming! Can you get to the middle and stay there until the whole island kills her? Would you say she's jamming? Into the wall? It's cramming! Do it! Yeah, but you can draw first blood. Crush him! That's you. You can do 5th-level spells? Damn! It's 6d8 halved thunder damage. No. Because she saved, she doesn't get pushed. Until the next turn. And that's when the Irresistible Dance kicks in. Delayed response. The ghost of Scanlan floats in front of you. In 30 days, she'll know what happened. Like a sensory deprivation tank. Thanks to Marvel Puzzle Quest!
