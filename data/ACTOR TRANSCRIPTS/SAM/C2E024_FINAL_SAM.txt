Well, I've been getting a lot of questions lately about, like, how do you write these ad things? I make it sound like, "Oh, I just come up with it on the fly!" It's not true. I spend a lot of time. In fact, I have a file here of rejected ads that I didn't deem good enough to use to promote our friends at D&D Beyond. dndbeyond.com. Go there, sign up, use their service like we do. Here's just a few. I'm just going to rifle through my files. This one's terrible. It was a pirate one, I was going to wear an eye patch, and go, "Ahoy and welcome to D&D be-yarrrgh! Grab your "duffel, set the binnacle and follow the freebooters to DnD beyond dot carrrrrrm!" But it didn't make sense. This one was-- I was going to do a Travis impression. "Yo bros, how about that Cowboys game, right? When Prescott hit Hurns on that outside post-route?" Fuck. "I nearly spilled my Natty Lite all over my Emmitt Smith commemorative Snuggie." "Man, I love sports. The smell of grass, the sound of marching bands, the sight of 22 men "pounding each other for--" All right. Here's an early draft of the now-famous D&D Beyond jingle. I went through many drafts of the lyrics before I landed on the primo ones that we got. (sings) You got your perfect wizard, his tomes and his supplies. But he burned his entire family to death and now he's traumatized. (laughter) This one? What was this one? Our tests indicate that your rash has spread to the groin ar-- Nope, that's not it. That was a different file. I had this one, this one's really conceptual. Here, I'll do it. Matt. Matt. Matt. Matt. That's all it says. It just keeps going and saying Matt. It wouldn't have worked! This is why it's rejected! Oh, this one. This one is specific for-- We're all excited to meet Laura and Travis's baby. So I consulted with some computer whizzes. We did some facial recognition to find out what their baby might look like. It's got Travis's eyes, Laura's eyebrows, and why don't you just feast your eyes? On this beauty. It is definitely your mouth. That's Travis's beard. Then the other one I had was flowers for you to say sorry for that last bit. That concludes the file, that's all I've got. The other things in here were just the pictures that I cut out. Yep. This is the final one. There's more rejected ones, but I'll read you those another day. I got my flask for tonight. It really is Anthony Kiedis. We'll do a side by side. We'll put it on Twitter. We'll post it later. But all of that is to say, D&D Beyond. Thank you. That's amazing. Oh wow. Short and sweet. Were we on our way to something? Were we going to some place? Blushing Tankard, is that a place to stay? We don't know. We just got here. Ooh what-- (yelling and blowing) Oh, are you drawing something? It's a dick. I knew it! Oh, you didn't even need to. Where are we dropping? Can we stay at this place as well or do we-- Give me that! I want to smell it. Because you put your lips to it. Did you just change your shirt, Travis? How did that happen? Sorry, focus! I don't think she's coming. Fire Bolt? Well. Can I have one to examine? You have a bunch of them. Matt, how much do we know about black powder? Okay, I'll take the first roll. Intelligence? 18. Up to this point, it's been rare that I or we've come across anything? Have I ever been dancing before? Like to a place like this? I've danced. Why, are we dancing? All right. I might need some liquor. Do we need to choreograph something? That sounds adorable. It's really nice. Right away? Do you play the piano? (playing The Entertainer) (funny accent) I don't know what that means. (laughter) I will dart at full speed, full dash to get that table. I'm going to jump on top of him and start rifling through his pockets. 23. No, 27. Anything other than money? Who were they? Not looking for work, we're just on a job. Yeah. They prefer the term "toadstools." I don't know if we can learn that dance. Let's just work on something simple. We're going to take a moment to work out a couple of moves in case it comes up. Just some basic hand moves. I'm much shorter than you. I like it. Caleb maybe can do some special effects. Maybe I should sit it out. A team drinking competition? Why would she come out of the room? Ooh! They said that they would send someone to the room, right, Molly? Didn't you say that they would send someone to the room? Like a babysitter. You could pay one of their women to watch our little Kiri. They're working women; we rent them for a time. Oh yeah, that's true! We could get a sturdy, strapping gigolo man to go up there and watch out for Kiri! Yes. She is a wallflower tonight. Three man-hours? Caleb, we may need a third person to join our dance now. You can't dance? You're not a dancer? Are you sure? I guess we can-- Beau? No, third. It was Kiri first, Caleb second. You're three. We should rehearse. We don't know when we're going to need the dance yet. This is good. You have an opportunity for later, if you choose to use it. Have you ever been with someone? Are you sure? Insight check. 20. Okay. He seems to be telling the truth. With the hooker? With the hooker? Okay, let's go make the rounds. The nerdiest raver. If there's any more of those sparklers or poppers around-- Steal some? That is not the Snitch. Just because it's gold, doesn't mean it's a Snitch. Okay. All right, thank you. No. I want something more powerful. Can you make something? Gulp. I swoop back into the shadows and mingle. Sorry, that was my fault. No, I-- I should have known. I can't talk to people. They're always shitty. It's a 100% accurate prediction. By the way, Beau, thank you for the other day. For talking to Caleb through his, you know. Just be sensitive around him. I know that that's not your strong suit, but he doesn't deal well with harsh criticism all the time. I'm used to it. Tell me something, how did you know about this place? Yeah, how did you know that the gnomes here get down with the funky fresh rhythm all night? What job? What's a Cobalt Soul? What kind of a faction of monks? Are you evil? Are you a bad guy? I don't think so. But I don't know, you seem to know a lot about a lot of things and sketchy things, too. What was that job? I thought you grew up-- didn't your parents make wine or something? What was this about a job? Wait, little townsgirl, her parents are wine makers, now you're a brutal assassin martial artist who can kill anything. What happened in between those two things? Yeah, right? Sure. You? No! Like what? What kind of stuff? You were bootlegging your old man's hooch? Wow. Is he a bad person? So you took matters into your own hands? And got in trouble, and were sent off to boarding school? With monks who are librarians and taught you how to kill with your fists. Wait, this was not by choice? You were abducted by monks?! Oh my gosh. Are you okay? Was it hard? I've never thought of you as an optimistic person, but that's a very positive way of looking at it. I would. Very much. I'll just take a little sip, in case we have to do the Hour of Power later. Wow. That's amazing. The trick is to not overmix. You don't want to overmix. Oh, sorry. We've been walking with your friend, Beau. Time is of the essence. He might be with a lady of the night later tonight. You might have to teach him quickly. Cram school. Yeah. Tonight, when it doesn't matter, you roll great. Yes, please. Yes, Caleb, what is it? Well, I think we're going to drink first. I do like to dance. Should I do the spell that you told me, the disguising spell, before the dance? All right. I'll do that. Oh, because the shadows won't match. Okay. I will. But you'll keep an eye out in case anyone-- All right. Thank you. I'll try. If you want to join us, you could just point and clap, off to the side. You don't have to dance. You can be there to, like-- You saw the guys who kicked you in the face. They had planned-out moves that were really cool. All right. We'll do choreography to the right and left, and you two be in the middle and just freestyle. What wands? The Wand of Smiles? That's probably it for the day. So petty. Are we all going? Who's the worst at drinking? Then maybe you should sit this one out. Do we want this to be the thing that we find out on? I've never had a drink in my life. Maybe you can be-- You could be the manager of the team! Yes. You can use your clerical mysticism to confuse and disrupt our enemy. All right. So I'll wait until there's-- He's trash talking! Don't listen to him! Maybe we should do our dance to distract his competitor now. It was 15, but 12. Oh no! No, Caleb, no! All right, Fjord! Tanya. It was always about money. She's the worst negotiator ever! I'm scared. All right. I've looked in the-- by the way, Matt-- I've looked in the thing. The-- The dodecahedron. All right, I'll try. Hello, sir. All right, I'll try! No! I don't have this. (stammering) Hello. I'm Otto. Sorry. Yes. It's a five. Yeah, I'll use it now! Okay, that's better. That's 17. I feel good. This feels right. I take out a bit of fleece and rub it and cast Silent Image on myself, to make a pussy eye, something real gross that looks real disgusting. That's an 18. Can I drink this with Mage Hand pouring from way up there? I do. Only 14. I got too cocky! Oh no! I don't think I can do it! Cut my eyes! Cut my eyelids off! Oh, what does that do? That's a 21. Sorry. Thank you. What does this get me? Guys, we can drink more! Let it be known that The Mighty Nein can take on any competitor and win! Victory will be ours in any arena! Well worth it. Oh yeah! Fjord, why not? We're in Hupperdook. Dook it up! I like that song! I'm totally fine. This is great. I can do anything! I can surf on a truck! (laughter) You were great out there. Mollymauk? We'll dance a bit. Absolutely! Yes, you're way stronger! Her koi pond! Sure. Do we have our money? Wait, all of our money is gone? I accuse Jester of stealing our money! You're right. It's stupid. We, as detectives, should think clearly about this and figure out when was the money stolen? Did you all have your money after the competition? Between the competition and bedtime, our money was stolen. Is Kiri with us? Kiri, did you steal our money? That cuts down on our detective work a lot. But it was only the five who competed who were robbed. It could be because we won, and Blemmy's crew stole our money. So we're going to talk to Irena, and then we're going to maybe find Blemmy, or maybe just follow Locate Object. I'm wearing it. No, I only keep my valuable things in other pockets. Within how many feet? Well, let's sees if she talks first. Does she? I haven't talked to her. Molly could use his masculine wiles to talk to-- You have pan wiles? She did it. I still think she did it. Bacon. We'll go check. Me too. Ask Irena about the little girl. Who was here last night? Irena, if Molly was interested, would you like-- No, just like-- Nevermind, let's go to Rissa. Don't you guys use scissors when you have sex with each other? This is real. That's what I was trying to get to. Wait, us? We have to answer truthfully? You're not my type. I like you. You're nice. Yes. They're probably not going to use them. They're just one drink. They would keep all the hundreds of gold. One more question! Irena. Where does the pianist live? Yeah, the guy playing the piano. What's his name? We never asked. Already? We're not there yet. Now? Okay. Makes sense. Let's run! Kiri's our little daughter, she's a bird." How does it work? What the fuck was that? Am I allowed to rob him? MARISHA and Or get it back for you. What would you do if you had the thing back, or-- It's okay. Calm down. Cleff, you know, you seem to have a fine eye and talent for mechanical devices. Do you ever have any need of alchemical combinations with your mechanical devices? I think I have a little oil, if you need it. As a sign of good faith. Didn't we get oil at some point? Wait. Oh, wait, no. I have holy water. That is not the same thing. All right. She's working for us. We need her Social Security Number for a 1099 by the way. (laughter) Well, okay. Then we're fine. He's adorable. Yes. Wow, so many daddy issues. She's not charming. On one of them or both? Should I pour this vial of acid on them? No! Now! Where does he live now? By the way, ice sailor sounds like the coolest job. What does that even mean? Mixed with Ice Road Truckers? What? What's wrong? You feel bad? We don't have any. Should I shoot them down while they run? Everyone. Everywhere. On the way out, can I just ask that gentleman Do you make any of those things that we've seen around here? (stammering) The pistols. Do you make those here? Oh. Thank you. Good day. The Iron Lot. Our list of suspects is as follows! The pianist! Blemmy! Rissa! The girl! Fitz and Ashton! We've eliminated as possible suspects Fitz and Ashton, really, they're really lame. The pianist! Because you did Locate Object within his-- Rissa! Because she was in Zone of Truth. That leaves our suspects Blemmy! And the girl. But! She has your copper pieces! You did! Could you find those specific silver pieces? Or the money she stole from us. So we go find Blemmy! Silver Falls. That's the residential area. Where the finger towers apartments are. Silver Falls! SAM, MATT, and Let's go. Will you be able to cast it again? Why did you-- Just while we stroll through the town? Sure. I guess. What are you searching for? Follow her! She's a bloodhound! Was it Blemmy? They all had nasty beards. Duncan, Valkin, Ruth, and Tanya. The first guy was Duncan. Valkin was the next guy. Oh, we're going to circle around? No, wait. Can we surround it first? Jesus. We surround the building. I will take out my wire and-- I whisper to Beau using Message, "What do you see? You can reply to this message." No. We don't know what you're doing. Should we draw them out? We're just going to bust in? What if they have traps and bombs? I will kill them all! You went down a chimney. What god were they worshiping? It's very clear. We have Kiri already. We take these four children with us, and we keep going. But we still have weeks left, don't we? You have a means of contacting The Gentleman. You could ask for a three-day extension. Caleb, you have a photographic memory, as you remind us every session. How long do we have until our time is up with The Gentleman? How long would it take, do we think, to get up north there, if we went straight? A week? So we've got a couple weeks! We have a day or two to spend on some prison breaking. Beauregard, don't you think they should be reunited with their father who loves them very much, and wants to be with them? And take them to an orphanage. It would be horrible if they were taken away from their home and given to some people who would do horrible things to them, or mistreat them for their whole childhoods, leaving them as cold, heartless, resting bitches. That was an intimidation tactic. I would never hurt a child! No, I wouldn't! I love children. That was an accident! Were you an orphan? Were you an orphan? Sorry. Eight hours, right? I have some human jerky left over. Well, we know how much the prostitutes cost to watch Kiri. The children do owe us a little bit. Oh Schusters! Oh yeah! Going to lean those up against the door jamb. We'll do recon for the afternoon and then we'll attack tomorrow morning. Unless this guy comes in the next week! If that happens!
