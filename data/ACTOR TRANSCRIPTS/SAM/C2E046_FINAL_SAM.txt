D&D Beyond, everybody, they're a great organization. Here's the truth of the matter. I wrote a piece tonight that featured heavily Laura Bailey, but she's not here. We even had music for it. Guys, hit that music. [epic music] It was going to be pretty epic, but she's not here, so I can't do it. I wrote another thing. I thought, tonight, I could go to the D&D Beyond webpage on my iPad here and read some stuff off of their FAQ or their About Us because I don't have anything planned. I'm going to go to my browser right now. This is going to be fine! I was just there earlier today, so I'll fire it up. Okay, here it is. FurryDate is a matchmaking website for the furry community. If you're looking for a furry friend-- that is not-- that must have been another site that wound up on my browser somehow. I will go further back in the history a little bit. Oh! Oh boy, that's a lot of skin. I think this site might be called Double D Beyond. Okay, it's a lot of pop-ups. I'll click on Install on all of them to make them go away. Okay, they're gone. This is great. This one's great. It's not what I was looking for, but there's this kid David, and he just went to the dentist. It looks like he's talking real funny. But that's not it. I'm going to go back a little. I'm trying to get back in the history to the website. I just got to something. Apparently I owe the IRS some money, and I have to go to Target to buy a gift card to send it to them. I think that's real. I might need to go after the show. Oh, and here we go! Okay. D&D Beyond is an amazing website that lets you create and store your characters, load up digital books and campaign guides, view stats for monsters, and so much more. Plus, they have a great theme song. Check them out. Show them the Critter love. Wish them a merry Christmas with the hashtag #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage. That's all I got. I don't think I can because I've lost control of this whole thing. Close. Okay, Wilford Brimley. Yes, we should go walk around. That's mine; this one's yours. Before dinner? That's true. Caleb, did you want to maybe look at some books before we leave? You're going to just stay? Are you going to go look through the stuff that we got? Do you want me to stay with you? Oh! Thank you! Yes! Downstairs? Sure, sure. There's just one above-deck cabin. Nothing. You have a compulsion. I just think it's funny. Oh yeah, we got a thing of marbles and a thing of ink. Caleb and I knew where you were and wanted to ascertain... Should we all have a buddy? Should we call these now? I call Caleb. Well I just wanted to make sure that I got Caleb, but you guys, maybe you should buddy up for future encounters. Good luck. You can't fight a compulsion, man. I know. Get that itch. Got to scratch it. Ooh! So we're all still friends? I didn't do anything wrong! I don't think I did anything wrong! That's a great pep talk. He said Felderwin. But meat tastes very, very good! Yes. Yes, we should. I can take him some in my pockets. Some mead, not meat. Okay. Let's just get a couple of bottles and share. Bunch of cups! Bunch of plates of gristle and meat and boar and fat. Some tripe. Maybe some knuckles. You were sleeping; you were snoring really loud, and it sounded like you were angry snoring. I'm sorry. Oh. (food coming out of mouth noises) No, that's not-- we were going to look for incense and supplies. We might also want to discuss what we're doing next. I mean, we just had this crazy escape from Pirate Island and now-- what are we doing, where are we going? Do you know where? So more traveling on the water? I will go. He's being very nice today. I know he feels guilty. He asked you to accompany him off the boat, he offered to make a plate of food for you, he's being nice to me. (gasp) Is he hitting on you? I think he's hitting on you. Are you sure? Felderwin. It's where some of us are from. Around there, yeah. I don't know. Go to the map. Your people. Reinforcements? I'm always paranoid. Did you self-echo? Feel out whether you would raise Uk'otoa from the dark and join its dark ways? Okay. All right. 'Sup, bee? Did you have funerals for all of us? Must have taken a lot of time. Like one a day. Was mine nice? Did anyone come? I guess not; you were on the ocean. Did you say anything? Like, they're bad words or something? You cursed at my funeral?! I didn't even get a funeral?! Everybody else did! Everyone got a funeral but me! Oh my god! You didn't give any of us funerals?! It's confusing. Okay. Group rule if any of us are missing for four or more days, we hold a funeral. Right? It's four days. Hells no. What's your last name? (laughter) Caleb's back at the boat. I'm looking for incense stores. 16. Island prices. Really? I've got lots of money. Yeah. I'll buy both healing potions. Did I find any incense? He did not give me an amount, so what's a normal amount of incense that you would need for a month of incense burning? Yeah. Like a hippie person. Okay. I'll take 50 gold worth. Great. Cool. Okay. I think we're good. I got the rest of it in my pockets. It's a little wet. Should we set off, or are we exploring this place more? I wonder what Caleb's up to right now? How's Yasha? Is she staring off into space, or just doing stuff? (laughter) There's flashes of light over there. I don't know what's happening. Hey, before we go into the storm, you want to look in the old fate-changing thing? He was doing things with flourish, yeah. 14? Don't you have a shield or something? Jesus. Oh boy. Okay, that's good. That was plus the seven? Yeah! First attack, second attack! Don't you get two attacks? It has to move. Isn't it frightened? Oh, shit. Lightning back? Reckless? D&D Beyond! The mast. She did succeed. (whispering) Clues. Look at the first letter of every word, and then take those and rearrange them. We've all had a couple of balls in our mouth before. Did it have an exact location or anything? Or ten spheres. You have no idea. What if someone else was searching for these powerful spheres and maybe was lying in wait at this temple, knowing that someone would maybe come bring one to it? I would if it were underwater because I would not be there to prevent it. Fuck no! Look what happened last time. There was a crazy ghost lady! No, she got away. We almost died. Did we? Yes? Fjord, you have a thing or two to learn from Jester about talking to people and engaging them on a personal level. She has what I would call the expert touch. She gets people. She sees into their hearts and souls. You are just a bastard man. Wait, Button Wonka's factory? With the boompa-loompas? I have! No one's seen anyone come in or out of that factory, and yet it makes buttons every day! How do they do it?! All right. This fucker. (laughter) I got incense, by the way. I got 50 gold worth, which was a lot. You may have all of it. Nopey nope! Yeah. Up here. Where there's no water. We're totally fine. Down there, there's dead bodies on seaweed. (laughter) Yasha, how are you feeling? I'm going to go find the other bottle of mead. Drink until I am more than intoxicated-- Fuck them! I need this right now. I'm kind of sick of it; it's the same booze over and over again. I'm sorry-- I love you baby, I love you, but it's getting to be a little bit-- ugh. It's like if you eat Rice Krispies every day-- (slurring) Let's go swimming. Before we go, I'm going to pull Caleb aside. Hey, while we're down there, if Fjord tries to be, like, bad, can you restrain him? Like if something overcomes him with evil, can you fuck him up? I would be ready to. I feel like 50-50 he's turning evil on us. Of course I will, I'm not going to leave you. You're puny and weak! I'm sorry. (laughter) By the way, what did we get? The books? Did we get any good spells? Tell me! Tapioca, yeah. It's just food? Okay. Any sort of--? And the books, any powerful spells? Anything that can--? And? Reality shifting things? Excellent. I give him a big kiss on his cheek, and it's real smelly. Me, not him. Both. Well, don't! We're in this together. Don't forget me. I won't forget you. Always. All right, fuckers, let's go! Oh, yeah. 23. One person or one limb? They all have one octopus tentacle? Should we make a distraction or anything? Buddy system. One at a time? We're not on the floor of the sea? We're above them? How about we four and the outside three? I will simultaneously fire a crossbow bolt. 12 to hit. Another 20 points of damage. 17! Who are you? 11. Haste on Fjord? Oh my god. Oh, me? I'm going to swim-- well, no. I have ranged attacks, so I'm going to just pick one, the one that Jester missed. Oh, 30. No, I've been rolling at disadvantage for-- it's 30 or 120 from the Tinkertop Boltblaster. I rolled at disadvantage last time. It's ranged disadvantage. Oh, underwater? Oh! I did not know that. Oh. Well then, I didn't hit the first one. It has to be within 30 underwater to hit? I still do disadvantage. Okay, got it. I fire and nothing happens. Oh, shit. I'll start going towards it. Yes, I will bonus action dash to make it 30 feet. Well, that was easy. Oh, so it wouldn't have worked? Come on! Fire at the one next to Beau. 14 to hit. Okay, okay, okay. Ten. 27. (crossbow reloading) Bonus action. Shoot the one next to Yasha. That doesn't hit. Only 11. Oh, yay. Actually, it's 13. I lied. Not sneak attack. I only get that once. Three plus five. Eight. I swim closer to Caleb. A different one swam up to you. Nice! Call tech support. That was good. Anyone need healing? Does anything happen? Just send him away? (mocking Laura in gibberish) Yeah, maybe he won. I do not. But I can make them laugh. I have explosive arrows, but I don't think they'll work underwater. Before we mount this attack, I'm going to swim up to Caleb and say I'm glad you forgot about us before, it means you're thinking about them, but I won't stop thinking about you and I'll give him one of the healing potions. Take this. I'm half-devil.
