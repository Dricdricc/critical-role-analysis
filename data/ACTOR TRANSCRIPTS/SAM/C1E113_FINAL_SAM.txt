Of all time. Ashley, what's going on with you? Anything to plug? Any other projects that you're working on? Before his arrival? But he takes a while to come back. Yeah, for sure. Is that now? Is sleep now? We'll wait a few hours. We were protecting it for you. The goddess Ioun told me to protect it in a circle reminiscent of the circle of my third eye. As Ioun wills it, yes. Ioun be pleased, I will. I'm a holy man. It's supposed to be awkward. We can't hear him so you'll have to talk. Hello? Percy, what a tough thing for you to do. He's a sword, he cuts, that's his thing. Sure. That sounds fun. What's a hit point? If Vax has a trammel, and Grog has a trammel, who has the third trammel? Someone who can fly. You can fly. Don't you have to be super strong to use these trammels? No, I'm fine with that. Can she fly? How? That's all we'll need. But that's when we'll need to use the trammels. Sometimes they're on the ankles. What are all of us doing? I'm praying into a book. Sure. How can we get Grog to fly, though? Because these pillars can't go all the way to the heavens, can they? No no, we're focused. I guess we could use these pillars, but it seems like a waste of your spell to get him halfway up towards Vecna, if Vecna is flying. If he's straight above us. All right, no plan. Can you do them on top of each other? My plan is to not run away, because we're going to die fighting or we're going to save the world, right? So I definitely won't be running away. Definitely. I may run away. I'll tell your story, and I'll tell it very well. (gasps) Wow! That's a deal. I have an idea about Grog flying that just occurred to me. Trinket's big. Trinket could be Polymorphed into something else big, like a flying eagle of some sort. And actually be useful. Yes, but with big risk comes big reward. It's a plan B. What flying things have we seen that are scary? I can't Polymorph; I could True Polymorph Trinket and permanently make him a wyvern. It can be dispelled, just at an action? Even if it becomes permanent? Wow. A simple, level three Dispel Magic can get rid of a 9th-level permanent Polymorph? I'm not going to waste my True Polymorph on that. Just standard Polymorph. Yeah. But it could still be dispelled. I was just talking about Polymorph. Yes. LIAM and Yeah. True. What's more important? Yeah. Well, let's see here. He has a challenge rating, doesn't he, this Trinket. So monsters of a six. I don't even know; I'll look at the list. Oh, yeah. I mean, if I True Polymorph him, Trinket, I could do a wyvern, or a young white dragon, or-- Is J'mon a brass or bronze? TRAVIS and I could do a young brass, young white dragon, or a wyvern. Or I could have another Scanlan. Scanlan Two can cast Polymorph. We'll see. (laughs) Or not. I'm pretty sure it will be apparent that he is not a real person. That's true. Well, you'll know, because, come on. This charm can't be replicated. Sure. Yeah. He could be the Meat Man. But I think you have to use truesight. It doesn't just happen. He can can certainly try. That's nice. He can for a while, yeah. These are good catch phrases, for sure. All right. I need the strength of two mes to win this fight. So I'm going to drop to my knees, and Wish to the gods that there was somehow more of me, that I could somehow be in two places at the same time. I wish for more me. Me-more. Me, but more. MÃ¡s Scanlan. Oh, yeah. Shit. (laughs) You guys can sleep, then I'll sleep, you wait for me. Sorry. It's already being done. Shit! We should have done that when we were waiting for fucking Vax! I didn't know it takes that long! (whispers) Okay. Oh my god. Hello, Scanlan, is it you? You're shorter than I thought you'd be. All right, let's just see if you're really Scanlan. Oh, okay. Let's see. I whip out my little measuring tape. One inch, by one inch, by one inch. Mm-hmm. That part's the same. I think there's only one way to find out. (singing) Naa! MATT and All right. This worked. Scanlan, let's go to sleep. I'll spoon you. Oh, we have extra items? Because he doesn't have any of my items, does he? Yes, yes, I will put him in the armor of-- Acid-- No, I have acid, you had cold. Oh, we had two acids! Yeah. So it's acid resistance. Wand of plus one, what is that? Yeah, great. Do that. He's also got bracers of defense, gloves of missile snaring, and a dragon slayer longsword? Sure, why not. Last year I was a crime boss, but the last few days have been really fun. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't know what's going to hit him. We're the S.H.I.T.s. LAURA and Myself. My other hand. Scanlan One, 19. Scanlan Two, 21. Not good. Ten. What? What's this? (cheering and laughing) Oh boy. I cover tiny Scanlan's eyes. Nope. Does Scanlan Two take my initiative, or no? The best. Natural 20, which made a 23. Oh, sorry, Scanlan Two is also 21. I'm just watching. And I turn to Scanlan Two and say So that's a gloomstalker. And that guy, I'm not sure what he is, but he looks really cool. We've been fighting silently. Yes. Yeah, you're fine. Do you have a name? We can kill you any second, so be scared of us, if you're an evil person. What? Come on, insta-kill this thing. I run out and I say Wait! Don't kill it! I'm just kidding. It's fine. Arkhan? Hi. How do you know this gentleman? Well, it was the worst kind of swamp. It was one with no water. Lady Briarwood. The queen? What kind of queen? Hm, that's no good. 11? You serve this queen? Devil's advocate maybe not. I don't know, maybe-- Whatcha doing over there, Johnson? No, that's not great. We'll figure it out later. Is that true? Wait, when did he say he couldn't die? He said he would fight like a man who is dead, but he wasn't-- Oh, no, you're right. I touch him to see if he's real. Kind of squishy. Really soft. Yeah. Pudgy. The outer walls of the city? How are we going to take down entire walls without being-- We don't know where these crystals are! All right. Is it walking? You got to stay within 60 feet of us? 30 feet? And can we kind of stay under the shadow of the gloomstalker? Oh, 29 and 20. His head has muscles. Making their way down. All right, but if we interfere with that forcefield and it somehow hits us, we're going to be hurting. One Punch Man. Yeah, well. You're going to roll well when it counts. The wall has an AC of 18? 20. I don't think we're going to be able to move. We're all in the same enclosed space? 19 and 30. Oh, no. Maybe she doesn't see you. Maybe she's talking to the gloomstalker. Into the earring I say, this is our chance, we leave him as a distraction and we go. They don't know we're here, we can run! Are they hovering? How did you know we would be here? There's no way to see out downstairs? There seems to be some windows on this side, right? I mean I'm in there somewhere. I think I would be near the window where I could kind of see-- what's your name, Ar-Can? Arkhan? He can just move with me, it's fine. Sure. Near the downstairs windows where I can see-- Oh they're armored up, all right, so then I'm upstairs. They. They. Ten. So did Scanlan Two. No, this is new for me. This is new. Matt, just manage the ten people and three creatures on the field right now and you'll be fine. Just do what you do. It's Vex's job to keep us in radius. He's going to know we're here. They're going to tell him. Is she aiming for the dragon? Big D. We have tape. We could get tape. Is this an attack roll that it's about to make? Scanlan Two is going to use Cutting Words to reduce the damage. Dex? Scanlan One 18. Scanlan Two 25. Can reduce damage by d12. Five. Five less. The testosterone in his group just went from a half to one. Math! (laughter) Can I Cutting Words? One of us has. Scanlan Prime steps up. Okay, then never mind. Got it. Scanlan One turns to Scanlan Two and sings a Song of Healing. I'm Prime right now. Ever? But not healed with a healing thing. Or a potion. Then never mind that. Oh boy. A little. All right. It's all good, guys. We're going to be fine! Then Scanlan One will heal himself with a bonus action Healing Word. And then he'll grab Scanlan Two and Dimension Door behind the dragon. On the ground. Back there. Yeah. Back ten feet. That would be great. Wait, this was Scanlan One. Scanlan One will walk around the side of the thing. Hey. I've got all the words to make the girls like me. She's grappled now? So if we hit her, it automatically hits, right? Is Bigby's Hand a magic attack or a physical attack? It's a melee spell attack. Okay, then I'll change my plans and I'll do that. Scanlan Two will cast Bigby's Hand at level-6 and pound her really hard. Shit. Is that 6d8? Or 8d8? Bigby's Hand; I always forget. And it starts at 4d8? Oh, so it's only 6d8. Yes. You know what? I'm going to do it at level-7, then. Okay. That's fine. All right, so a bunch of d8s. 17 plus 11. Yeah. One, two, three, four, five. I like these. 29. 29, and then I guess, as his bonus action, he'll inspire Vax, who's not even here. Scanlan Two only knows the songs of Scanlan, so he will sing, weirdly hollowly (singing) When I get that feeling, I want Clarota healing. (laughter) And then he moves. He ducks back behind there. Yeah, just peeking out a little so he can see where Bigby's Hand is. So romantic. She's going to die. That would be crazy. (whispered) Chop off her hand. With your rage? Matt, don't forget those two guys. That is not a place. Pew pew! Come on, Arkhan. She's okay. Scanlan Two's going to cast Counterspell. Against a bat. What does that mean, snatched? He doesn't like this. No. No, it doesn't say that it's special. Why don't you plan a backup, just in case? Guys, what are those shirts? Can you hold up that shirt again? Oh, there it is. Ooh! They were to each other. Ashley Johnson. Clutch. Bicoastal Roll. I can do something. I can do one thing. Scanlan One will just hold his turn until those gloomstalkers are in range or until they move, and then he'll cast, I don't know, frigging Wand of Magic Missiles, I don't know. He's 150 feet away? I can run 25 feet and then reach 120 feet. I'm five feet shy. He already did 150 getting to your turn so he'll be able to do another 150-- It's Scanlan Two's turn. He's going to bonus action Bigby's Hand, grapple one of the gloomstalkers. The one we've been working on. Not punches, grapple. They're easily killed. Well, do you want to kill them, or save them for riding on? Well, I'll just hold him for you. One we're saving for him. Ooh. Then never mind, we kill it. It's an attack. Oh my God! That was the most sniper thing you've ever done! Is he there? No bueno. Radiant something, right? Don't do that. Just to get there as fast as you can. Is it your turn Keyleth? Vecna gives up. We're fighting her again! I don't know if you can cut the whole tower down. They'll probably try to stop you. Don't you think? Do we see invisible doors? Can she talk? Can you make her talk? You knocked her up. Maybe they'll think that it's just a fashion thing, and they'll let her through. I need a house. Can I take her branches and make one? Oh, it's The Giving Tree. (groaning) Let's just charge in. This is a fricking giant, right? We've killed giants. This is the best plan. Stealth? Oh shit. I rolled a two and a two, so that's 15 and 15. We're going inside, we don't need it anymore! I mean, what are you going to do with a flying thing in a narrow stairway? We've seen inside, we scryed inside. It's a very narrow stairway going up. Oh yeah, meet us up top? (under his breath) He ain't going to survive that. What are they doing? Pike, can't you kill masses of undead? Wisdom, intelligence, or charisma. Has your wisdom gone up at all? Felicia Day! (gasping) Oh, no! You just killed two of our friends, Pike! No, we should just run up! The giant's going to take more than one hit. Everyone all healed up to full? LAURA and Should we pause and heal, or--? If you take a potion, you're full. Right? Don't you have your thing going, or no, is that gone? Oh, I didn't know that. Wait, we're doing a short rest? Wait, who needs it? Don't you have a healing spell? No no, because it maximizes it. Bye, Vasselheim. Seems terrible. We have potions! Can't we drink potions? No, we have other ones, though. No. Vasselheim. It's a big tower. There's lots of shit up there. Scanlan's got healing. Scanlan Two's got healing. We can pump you guys up. How many can you include? Scanlan Two has tons of healing spells that he can use, so use them. He's going to be dead soon anyway. Yeah, I can heal you and heal you and heal you until you're all done. It's a level one bullshit spell slot. No short rest! Heal some people, I'll heal some more. We got this. We got lots of healing. Great! I will take it as well. You said up to six people? I'll take that. I will cast Healing Word, or Scanlan Two will cast Healing Word at 2nd-level for you. Yeah. That's-- I don't have Cure Wounds. That's nine more points for you. Yeah. Oh, wait! I can sing a Song of Rest. Yeah. That makes sense. I will heal you another 2nd-level healing spell. That's another 12 points. Scanlan Two. We did it with an earring. Sorry, you weren't on. We're all on iPhones and you're on a Windows phone. Wait, we're doing things that last an hour? Shit. This is inspiring. Wow, that was so inspiring. I mean, who's going to die? Pike can have one. That's me. Technically. He's not going to last that long, guys. Pike, I accept your blessing. No, what does it mean? Well, what does it mean? What could it mean?! Just then, the real Scanlan comes back from peeing. He's like, what'd I miss, guys? (laughter) We're trying to decide whether we went left or right up the stairs. What about the zombies? No no, his slave zombies. Scanlan Two is okay. He made a 17. Scanlan One had a one. I don't know Dispel Magic. Good question. If only the person in here with me was also of gnome size. Oh wait! She is. We'll Dimension Door out. I don't know how this spell works. I hope it works. We might get hit on the way out. A charisma save? Is this magic? Okay. 20. I've never had to make a charisma saving throw before. Wait, did you switch your boots? Two shirtless, hunky dudes holding each other?! In crazy poses? Yes. We did. Fire stays where it is, typically. It doesn't move up. Full of chemicals. That's all she has, right? Scanlan will invoke the Blessing of the Knowing Mistress. I can't see anything! Everything's silver! Oh god, I'm blind! I'm just kidding. I can see fine. Now's the time? Polymorph only lasts-- is it an hour or ten minutes? I've got to learn this. Yeah, sure. Scanlan Two is going to dump a 3rd-level spell into the Tome of Isolation to reveal the hidden text. Is it only revealed to Scanlan Two, or is it revealed to everyone? No, I do need to, to reveal the text. It's hidden otherwise. I have a book I need to read. Standard undead? I could hold one. I could hold one. Paralyze one of them. Both of you guys got big damage. Unleash everything. Right as he runs, Scanlan says Don't fuck this up! (high-pitched) Is that my girl? Is that my baby girl? It's my baby girl-- Yeah, do that. Revivify them. Take the bands off and Revivify them. Take it off of Gilmore. He's still alive. Save her. Right now. I go, grab her, and hold her. These are big spells, aren't they? Shaun. Can you get them out of here? No! He's got to get them away. They're at one hit point each! I grab Kaylie by the face and I say to her Goodbye. Ashley, can you pipe in?
