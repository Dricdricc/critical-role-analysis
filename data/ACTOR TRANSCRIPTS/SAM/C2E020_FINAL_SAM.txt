Yes, D&D Beyond, a consistent and amazing sponsor of our show, wants to let you guys know that Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes is out! Get yours right now on the D&D Beyond website. To celebrate, I called my old friend, Rhody Slater. Ready? (As surfer) Hang ten, kahunas and wahines! It's Rhody Slater! Duck diving the word from D&D Beyond! Yank that leash and wrap up the dawn patrol because if a player in your campaign has a master level subscription, any player that owns Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes can share content with everyone in your party. Frothy, right? Well, kick out your longboard because-- Because-- (As Sam) You know what, guys? I can't do this. It's not D&D Beyond, they're a great sponsor. It's me. You know, I just felt like at this point in my career I'd be doing serious shit like Ibsen or O'Neill, but I'm doing this shitty Keanu Reeves voice and writing crappy sitcom catchphrases. No offense, Ashley. This stuff is going to live on the internet forever! My kids are going to watch this and be like like, "Wow, your dad was a loser," you know? I feel like I can do so much more. (phone rings) Lord of the Wings is not a bad restaurant. It's just average. I might get some residuals. Get your fingerprints off it! That was the saddest woo-hoo. And we leveled up. Of course I do. Sure, here's my flask. Well, I can't see inside it, so I don't know. But I'm sure there's some sort experiment we could do to-- It's all right, you can have as much as you want. It's endless. No. I mean, I rarely did anyway. I stole it, but now I don't have to do that either! Yeah. I think it's about two-thirds full most of the time. Sure. I decided the first time and that's what it is, always. Why would I get sick of it? It's wonderful. Yes, it replenishes with my favorite kind of whiskey. The kind that gets you good and drunk. I could try. I think it's a good experiment. They already started it. Let's just see what happens! I'll drink a bunch. Did it get lower? (slurred) I don't want to waste it. (slurred) I guess I could. Should I throw up now? Stick something down my throat. (yelling and gagging) Did it work? No, not really. A little sticky. Yeah. I think four? Nine. But two are always gone. You're our strategy guy, right? Okay. That's not good. Could we make that tapestry into coats? Like Teen Wolf? That's terrible. And continue, or stop? Oh yeah. Should we hide? Can you try it on the wheel? Let's just do it! Let's see what happens. Yes, you are! Wait, we have two broken wheels? We could pull the cart off the road if Yasha picks it up and runs along with it. In the swamp? Are there any woods or anywhere to hide? I'm going to go in the grass. 22. Am I still drunk? Do I need to--? Do either of them have saddlebags? Can I do a little Mage Hand-y? A little fishing in the one that's closest to me? 24. I hold on to it. Can I peek inside? It's a good one. Bye. Amazing. Let's not get crazy, what he can do is incredible. Have you seen him in action? Oh yes, she's super strong, yeah. Just her magic, there's no-- Oh no, are going to ring a bell in my head? Do you wear contacts? So that we don't get wet? The map. (singing) Get out the map! His name was Captain Maximilian. Me too! I'm down here, too! (farting noise) What?! So was she a Xhorhasian spy and are we all dead in our sleep? I'll take it. You can do it. How you holding up? Can I go under you? Can you be like a shelter for me? Like a lean-to? Wing? I don't know how it works. But your arm is probably big enough to shield me from the rain. Thank you. Thank you, yes. I don't like to get wet. That's okay. Give you a moment? Do you have to take a piss? All right, I won't look. I look. (whispered) And a baseball bat. You got bark from a lightning-struck tree? Do you collect things? I collect things. What kind of collections do you have? Oh, it's beautiful! Is it a special someone? Someone back home? That's so nice. I collect all sorts of things. I have a button collection. I used to collect stamps, I used to collect different kinds of vials of different sorts of fluids and things like that. I collect soles of shoes. Not shoes, just the soles. Yeah, they come in many different shapes and sizes. The cobblers throw them away when they're bad. You can fish them out of the trash and you can have a whole bunch of them. Nothing. I mean, you can play a little drum thing with them. Sure, if you string them together, they make a Roman gladiator belt sort of a thing. Ooh, I could be a little bit taller! I think if you put two on top of each other and push them in, it looks like lips are talking! I feel like we've gotten to know each other so well! Yes, under your gigantic arm, thank you. Happens every time it rains. Let's take the whole fucking tree! A magical shelter? You need more paper? Caleb can do it if he sets his mind to it! Are we waiting here for a while? Oh, we're on a moving cart? As we travel, I'm going to try to make acid. Probably not a great idea, but I'm going to-- Yeah, I bought a kit. I've been trying to do it for a while, but we've never stopped. 16 plus proficiency is 19. But now I roll at disadvantage. Nine. That's a 12. Yeah. One vial of acid, great. Do we know anything about where we're going? Yeah, but it's a big swamp. Are any of us good at like wood stuff? Is this me? Am I the girl? Are we going to stop? We're moving? Use Mending. The road goes through the swamp. That's specific. Please be a one. Please be a one. Please be a one. Have we stopped the cart? Should we stop moving the cart? Should we continue on, or--? Maybe it's Febron, maybe that's a-- We press on. How far is it? Don't worry? What? Shit. I don't know. Right now, we're saving Jester. So many trees. Oh, boy. You know what we never do? Tap into our pool of luck. Yeah, we never use it. We've never ever used it. Ever. You know the dodecahedron thing. I'll take it. 12. Dun-dun-dun-dun lollipop! Wow, I'm feeling so fast. I will dash. You know, to catch up to them, I guess. I bonus action dash. Then I get two attacks. Two actions now, right? Whoa. That's still out of range of hand crossbow. Well, no it's not. It's that I have to fire at disadvantage. All right. Sure. I'll do that, I guess. That's true. Okay. I'll use one action to get closer still. Okay. I'll test the air and do a lob shot. Okay. Ooh. Two plus something, so it's nine. I'm sorry, Caleb! I failed you. (mockingly) I can't do anything. I suck. It has disadvantage to perceive? Blind or deaf? Because that gator is blind, does that mean it counts as sneak attack? Okay. Then I will bolt, bolt, bolt. Three attacks. They all hit. 19, 15, 13, plus things I'll roll again. Sure. One of them is a natural 20. They all get sneak attack. Oh, okay. Got it. Well, it was the second one. Yes. Okay. --is 17 plus four, 21. Plus I'll use Fury of the Small, making it 26. Just once a day. Then second does not get sneak attack? Even though it's at disadvantage. Six, but that's doubled? Four, so eight. Eight for that one. Then one more. That's ten. It still can't stop thinking about Mollymauk, though. I'm going to move behind that rock over there. (yelping) That's it. Sure. Damn it. Sure. I'm going to be using Uncanny Dodge for the first time. (yelping) We're both reptiles, man! Come on! Be cool! I don't know. Maybe he's dumb. Man, this is exciting. That's not enough. I use my first action to try and resist the grapple and escape. (stuttering) Yes, whatever's-- yes, Acrobatics. Ooh, 18. Is it engaged with Beau? Can I get a sneak attack on it? Okay, great. I will shoot it in the face. Ooh, not great. 12. What's that mean? Cool. 17. Oh wow. Okay, that's a hit. Ooh, they're all bad. 12. If that was one side of the throat, I'll go for the other side. Oh, terrible, 11. Oh, still advantage, or that's just once a turn? Oh, wow, okay. That hits! That's an 18. Five more points of damage. But it might in a second, because I'm going to run behind that tree. I'm going to get away. Get away as fast and as far as I can. Sure. Any way you think it won't see me. That hits. I will use my-- Wait, can I use Uncanny Dodge again because it's gone around? Yeah, uncanny dodge to make it 14. (yelling) Again? I just got out! Oh, that's nice of him. Yeah, that hits. Out. MATT You are knocked prone and it's going to try and bite you. That's what it was doing on its turn. It's 18 now. Because of the Haste, but I don't know, I'm dead. Do I have Haste if I'm unconscious? You're calling someone? The spell is active because it makes you faster. This feels wrong. Do it, just do it, I'll take it. I don't feel right about this. I even die fast. I just failed two death saves from that pun. You got the kill? You were barely in the fight! The lowest level possible. That was scary, I should not have been this close. Where were you? I was doing everything up there! A slop dolly?! What's a slop dolly? Oh, sorry Matt, is there something you'd like to discuss with the table? Arms. Out of sockets. Maybe it was separated from its parents or something? Where do you live? Maybe it wants some paper. Kiri? It's a him? A boy bird, or a girl bird, or just a bird bird? But your family went the other way? To the west? She's four. I don't really know, but I'm twice her age at least! That's true. Oh! Oh, I have a pouch of things this one might like! I have dried corn and oats and things. Would you peck on these? Oh, okay. Ow. Ow! Oh, Beau, come on-- That they don't talk. We don't know that this feathers are her parents. You said that you could send a message? Wow. But don't you need to know who you're telling it to or something? We should try it now. Oh. We can't leave her, the swamp things will kill it. Welcome to The Mighty Nein! I just give her a kiss. She's just so cute, you know? Cats don't like birds. I've got some clothing that would fit her! My clothing. I give you my cape and and stuff. I can't move. Okay, thank you. Wait, that's the way that we go to find our-- Okay, let's go. I'm going to cast Disguise Self on myself. A little halfling girl. It's still me. I can change my body into other things, woo! Oh, here! Take my mask. Oh, but you have a beak. How much of that do you have? What stuff? Bloody crocodile skins? Well, Caleb can put his string around it. (deep voice) Please step away from the vehicle. We're bringing her into the bar? I guess not. Do you drink liquor, Kiri? Booze? LIAM, TALIESIN and Here, I'll give you-- That's true. That's a bad idea. Let's go in. Alfield. We can look in a few more minutes. No, she's on the wagon. They always fight for the check. You're building a stage for something? Is there some sort of circus in town? You said a silver per person? We'll be fine. We found him! We won! We send the message back to The Gentleman, and we'll collect our money. Oh, that's right, that's not-- okay, I'm sorry, I was confused. Oh, boy. Can you use Mending on him? I'm covering Kiri's ears. Copper? 100 copper? Yeah, I'll pour you a drink. I'll refill his cup. Does he have a cup? With my flask, I'll fill it up. Half now, half upon-- 100 gold. Sure. I'll take Caleb's share. 12? I'll take the rest. 27 from me. 17. You're the worst. 1030. A soft 1030. Oh, boy. There's four rooms one of them is Yasha and the weirdo-- Okay. As we go into our room, I say to Caleb It's not really haunted, is it? Have him take care of it. Well, we know what's in it. There's inventory, so if anything's missing, it's on him. It's on Dent. The only thing on the cart is your thing that you bought at the festival and some crocodile skins. That is true. (squeaking) (squeaking) Well, thank you. You know, I don't want to burden you with my shit. You've got your own fish to fry and your own battles to wage, and I don't want you to have to worry about me or anything. That means a lot to me, and-- oh, hello. That's the point. I just want you to be okay. It sounds like this person who corrupted you is out there still, and we need to find him and you know, kill him or whatever? If that's something that you want to do? I'm fine focusing on that. I've got my own issues, but I'm fine taking care of yours first. The thing is, your story that you poured out to me and Beau, the other day-- it was very sad, and I'm so sorry that you had to go through it, but I have to say, in a way, I'm a little bit jealous. Because you've done this horrible thing-- not to make light of it or anything, but it's bad-- and we can all tell that you're wearing it in your dirty clothes and your mussed hair-- Well, I know, but still-- You know when you're dirty and it rains, and it streaks down and dries? That's the sort of thing you've got going on right now. But you've got a lot of dirt on you. No. All I'm saying is, I feel like you can get revenge. You can maybe even get redemption for what you've done, and you can become a better person. You can do good to counteract the bad that you've done in your past, and maybe someday there will be an end to your suffering. All right. Thank you for the offer. Good night, Caleb. Oh god. (electric guitar riff) You filled that whole thing?! We haven't used it, yet. I'll take it. Playing the kenku? (exaggerated American accent) But only if he does an American accent. (exaggerated American accent) I'm from California.
