Nobody told me that the show was starting. Oh, that's right. But you can already vote. They’re choosing representatives? Just like us! Is it Jarrett? Best kind of surprise. I am not sleeping. Remember, I said I was staying up to read my book. Play ding dong... Wait, refresh us all. Is Liam - I'm sorry - is Vax naked? And what underneath? So, he's naked. No armor. No weapons. But wait! The robe has like a rope tie to tie. I'm awake. Oh, shit. Ninjas! Is initiative an ability check? (all laugh) Then I will inspire myself on my initiative roll. Yes. So I will just say, "Come on Scanlan. Wake up! Wake up, man!" (all laugh) No, it's a 7. It's a 7. That brings my initiative to 19. How many points? Do we know how far? We've not been there, we're not familiar with it. Okay. I'll use, I guess, some movement to gather my belongings and anything that I don't still have on. I'll just grab a couple of instruments. And go. I'll grab the shawm and the Mythcarver. And if I've ever been up there, I'm going to try to Dimension Door to the west tower. I don't know if I'm familiar enough with it, but I'll give it a shot. What did we do up there? Did you have hickies afterward, or something? SAM AND Oh, it worked! That's - I mean, that's pretty much all I've got. I imagine I would be pretty confused, so - I will probably just, if I have any time left, I'll just say, "What the fuck is going on, Gilmore?" And that's it. Oh, shit. (all laugh) But I just got here! Don’t leave! The one that smells like patchouli is mine. So you’re naked with a shield and a mace. Man. Pikey. Oh my gosh, she going to die. How did that happen so fast? What are these assassins? And weirdly hairy shoulders. (all laugh) Oh, god. I never knew. Gun stuff. Ooh! Hashtag gun stuff. I go to the ledge and look over. Okay, shit. My stuff doesn’t go that far, does it? Any of my vocal spells, only goes 60 - Yeah, fuck. All right. Well then, for my action-slash-attack, I, overcome with fury seeing my friend on the ground, pull out Mythcarver and just fucking jump and plunge. And I have advantage because I’ve inspired myself. (all laugh) But I’m also exhausted. I rolled twice for that. 14. 15. Plus I don’t know what! I don’t do these things! Strength? Is that strength? Oh, it’s +8. That’s a 23. Okay. I don’t know what to do now. I roll a d8? Okay. 8 + 3, so that’s 11. Plus 1d6 force damage. 6! Holy shit! (all laugh) So that’s 11, that’s 17. Right? Okay. Do I still get my bonus action? Okay, so I, on the ground, turn over to Vax and I’ll bonus Healing Word him. And I will sing with whatever wind I have left in my body, "(singing) Vax’ildan, you’re going to put up a good fight, "Vax’ildan, I need you to put up a good fight. "Put up a good fight! Put up a good fight!" That’s "Roxanne." (all laugh) 4! I’m rolling great! Plus 5. So you have 9 hit points! Oh, boy. She’s bleeding all over. Yeah, you can’t really do anything. Yeah, but just to get through this portal, he’s going to have to move. It’s a whole other turn. Naked ass. It’s movie night. They’re all watching The Sound of Music in the rec room. What do you need? What? What’s wrong? You were born for this stuff. I don’t know what it means. We’re on point today. Whoa! She’s surfing on the broom. Yeah! 5d8? I think you’ll probably have mercy on him, right? Jesus. Trinket’s the best at killing dead guys. He’s doing math. It’s a Beautiful Mind moment right now. He’s thinking about that great Loot Crate deal. How many people will die instantly Oh, if he runs away I can cast a spell on him. Well, it’s not the rule, though, I don’t want any preferential - Yeah, I’m hurt, so maybe it wouldn’t work. Okay. Well, what I was going to cast before he ran away was Bigby’s Hand and try to grapple him. (singing) Bigby's Hand! 5. What? Bigby... But the hand is still there? He’s somehow immune to hand-based attacks. What if it were a foot? Would that have the same effect? Shit! Well, then I flip him off with it, but the British way. (all laugh) All right, I’m up. Well, that didn’t work. So I guess I’ll drop that. And instead - Jesus, what else can he resist? Fucking shit. How far is he from me? Okay. I’ll use half of my movement to get up, and I will stare daggers at him and cast Eyebite against him. Yeah, I’ll just do one of these and I'll sing at him. I'll sing, "(singing) I hate rakasha, so put another arrow in his body, baby! (others join in singing) "I hate rakasha, "so come and take the time and fight with me!" (all laugh) Fucking - Fuck! But it was a good song! But what, he’s impervious to spells? How did that happen? That’s a 6th-level spell! I don’t have a sword anymore. He picked it up, right? So, I guess I will… Oh, yeah. That guy. (all laugh) I’ll heal you again with a - I can only do a level 1 bonus action with a Healing Word, right? Oh, then I’ll do a level 2 Healing Word. Ooh. 2d4 + 5 and 5? Or 2d4 + 5? Well, this is shitty. It’s 9 points again. Cool move. Grapple that dick. (singing) Blazing Bowstring! Our music, it’s gone. That’s also Bluegrass, folks. This is exciting. Exposed skin. So, I think I understand. You have to be naked to cast spells on it. Is that it? A bloody robe. What happened? Oh, god. What? What dagger? You had a - I’ll grab the dagger. I’m coming with. I’m with. Yes. Hold on, we’re close enough that magic has no effect, yeah? I’ll cast Mage Hand to slap Percy in the face. No effect. Throw it in the orb! Will the Bag of Holding work down here? No, we can use it as a weapon. Ooh. Vax, Vax, quick! Vax, ask him a question that only Gilmore would know the answer to. Dot dot dot? Where was Kashaw? Do "ra-kasha-kashas" typically hire people? Where do they come from? Do they come with a band of merry men? I don't know anything about them. Oh, there was a "raka-sha-sha." No, I think you're saying it wrong. Do they travel with assassin friends all the time? Where do they come from? Is there a way to prevent the "sha-ka-kan" from coming back? And now Pike. We'll put it on the list. Ooh. Ugh. Five questions? Stillben. How many men? Wait, there's Kashaw's. At some point, Percy, ask Gilmore about that robe. Is it worth anything? Well, why don't you take it? So does it - do you have to - anyone you put it on, it curses them? Keep that robe. (laughs) His pec. Oh, he's The Crow! He's The Crow! (whispering) Wow. Have the guards reported yet? You could spend the night tracking him. Or we could just drink. I'm reading this whole time. Just reading and reading. Does it make mixed drinks? I mean, I'd tell everyone, "Call me if it's important. I've got to do this." I did. Did we inspect any of the other bodies? What kind? Just poison? A Scrying Eye. When I heard she was leaving, I went out looking for Pike, and I've come up to where they are. (out of breath) Oh, sorry. No, no, it's me. It's me. It's me. Sorry. Sorry. There was a very frightened child over there with a bunch of fruit. (all laugh) He was crying. I love a good lime. Pike, sorry. I didn't know we were parting ways. Well, I respect that. I just wanted to - before we bid adieu, I wanted - I can't believe we're leaving you again. But I just wanted to clear the air a bit. You know, a short while ago, I proposed marriage. I've been thinking about it a lot - - and I hope you have been, too. Anyway, listen, before you do what you're going to do and we're going to go off on our way, I just wanted to say that I am here to officially absolve you of that proposal, and I rescind it. I was foolish to do so, and I don't want there to be any strings attached when we leave, and I think, really, with you on the cusp of parting ways and me seeing my daughter and everything, everything's come into a bit of a clearer focus, and... I think I've always been in love with the idea of you. You know, you're so perfect and beautiful and smart and - But I don't want to love an idea. I want to love a girl. And I think in all of this time of pining after you, I forgot to just hang out with you and know you as a person, and I'm sorry for that. So I'm sorry for objectifying you or whatever. LAURA AND We'll be friends. We'll be friends. Listen, I will always love you, but I don't want this to be a barrier in our friendship anymore, so I'm taking it off the table. And besides, all I really want is to matter to someone, and I do now, and that's very new for me, and confusing, and exhilarating, and I've got to figure out how to do it and, well, I'll work on that, and you work on whatever you're working on, and I will say this before we leave. I'm a little older than you, so I can give you some advice. I will say, speaking as someone who has lost out on years of a relationship with someone I care deeply about, if you have someone out there that you love, you should tell that person, or, at least, tell someone about it. It's a weight that you're going to continue to bear, and you're going to miss out on months and years of either knowing or not knowing. You don't have to tell me, but you're the bravest woman I know, and you should be brave enough to just admit your feelings. Anyway, I just wanted to say - Ah. It's not happening, sorry. Just so I'm clear. Off the table now. I'm sorry. I just have to let you down. All right, well. Oh! Hugs? Of course. Of course. Yeah, I go to see Vex real quick. Yeah. Oi, you. Oi. Remember when I did you a favor, and you came to my room, and I taught you how to fly the broom? And you said you owed me one? Here's the payback. You have to wear this fucking hat every time you fly. (all laugh) It looks really cool. Thank you. That would make me so happy. The debt is paid. Yes! The silhouette is beautiful on you. Ooh. Give it a try. What to Do in Whitestone for 48 Hours. Is it a profession of love? (laughs) Damn it! It was that guy with the burnt chicken. Yes! (laughs) Shall we? Do we have to say a magic word? Can we say a magic word? All right. Wait, did it happen already? We're still here. But we weren't in the Feywild, were we? Maybe we'll find out! Who knows what we'll encounter. Wait, what does she have? Is that a Pike quilt?
