You guys know what D&D Beyond is? It's awesome. You should check out the site dndbeyond.com. They also now have open alpha access for an upcoming mobile app. The D&D Beyond team is looking for additional stress testers and you can sign up using the following links. Insert links below me. Oh, I have to read it? Okay, bit.ly/dndios and bit.ly/dndandroid. Yeah, they know what bit.ly is. Sure. Since D&D is such a dorky 80s thing to do, I've composed a dorky 80s jingle for D&D Beyond. (cheering) I was. You had to imagine the synths. Just one? Don't open it! Your hands will touch it and it will no longer be mint! (groaning) You're on the back of a comic book? I have one more thing. A quick shoutout to a critter named Carol who is an awesome fantasy writer and friend of the show. She's been feeling a little under the weather but she's been watching our new campaign and I wanted to wish her a speedy recovery and thanks for watching. You said "The sha--" and she laughed. Like before you were done with the word shaft. Not from her perspective. (laughter) The path-- Where are we? There's too many options! Wait, are we just going to attack? We should distract them--! Oh, Jesus. I could distract them or something first! I'm not drunk anymore, right? 24. Natural 20. It's one of the best rolls you can make in the game. What is our initiative shit? Okay, but I didn't see, and you guys decided to attack first. I will grace you going first if you prefer. Does that mean I still get to move and shit when I do my move? Then I'll go now. Because they're more than 30 feet away, right? Hand crossbow, it says 30/120. I've got to be within 30 to hit them without disadvantage, right? If I run out there, they'll see me and I won't be sneak attack anymore, right? How does this work? I can take my shot from here. All right. I will fire. Ooh! 17 plus a lot. Six! 17 plus six to hit. I thought you just said I had advantage! Could I run forward and still get the sneak attack? That's what I will do. Undo. Now I have to roll for stealth, right? I'm rolling to hit? Okay. Still 17 plus six. Cool. 11 points. Not very good rolls. The one that's holding the child. Can I use my regular-- regular gnoll. Do I have remaining movement as a bonus? Yes. I will dash away, but I can't hide. I will dash behind those rocks to my right. Yes. In those skulls or anywhere around there. That was it? We cycled through a whole round of combat? I'll have to move. I'll lean around to get around that stalagtite. No, just so I can get an eyeline on the one I already shot once. Yeah. Anywhere. I'm going to move right back in a second. I'll lean around, reload. Oh, god! Fire again. Do I get sneak attack? No, right? Shitballs. 20 to hit. Eight. What does the child look like? He or she? It's a boy? And human, I don't know anything about. Is it injured? No! I'm too scared to go over there. No, there's a child in need. We've got to help. Yeah. Nott's going to scurry over to the boy as fast as she can scurry. Yep, all the way to the little boy. (screech) I'm good! I'm a good one! I'm good! As per usual. Where is he? No. You can't have a better accent than all of us. Hits! Skadoosh. Your spellcasting modifier-- Okay, I've got this thing on my arm? So with my other hand, I will (high-pitched whimpering) grab its face (normal voice) and I will say a few a words that Caleb told me and cast Shocking Grasp on it! Shit, how do I find out? You click on it. Ooh! Nine. (yelps) Oh, god. Let's see here. I've still got some bonus-y stuff. Can I disengage? No, because-- Okay. I'll disengage, grab the boy, and try to lead him behind the-- there's an overturned table? Like right there. Can I do that? We'll find out. I'm sure this one is hardy. You don't have to. Just kill-- the kid's gonna live. Do you really care about the kid? Then don't help. Hells no! Angry healing. However nothing. He needs some help! Who are you?! Ah! Who are you? (swooning) He said Shakäste. He doesn't look good. Can you do anything to help this guy? Insight check! [laughter] 11 plus, what am I adding? 13. How handsome is he? Bachelorette finalist? [laughter] Yeah, I could down there. I've seen their traps. I know their methods! Let me look! Are there? Five. Plus five is ten. Let's open the door. Is the, is the-- Oh, sorry, go on. Can I ask the woman, is this your child? Are we going to leave some folks down here to-- What if they repopulate all of these rooms that we've already cleared? I don't like this plan at all. What if someone-- What if one of the gnolls wanders into this room and sees five of his dead brothers? There's a whole other room with dead bodies in it that we also caused, and also ball bearings. All right. Are there any other boxes or things to search down here before we get out? No, it smells good to me! Any baubles or little doodads? Oh, I don't care about worth. Gently! You should be careful with that. Those can make big booms. (flustered noise) He's got a Frumpkin too! I will go ahead of the party to run point. 11. I helped too! 13. LAURA and All right, that's a good idea. He's very charming. One that can see in the dark. Don't make me do this again. All right. Sure, what does that mean? Uh-huh. I'm not interested in a relationship right now. Oh, yes! Pretty things. Sure, yes! Yes, absolutely. Give me something. I feel inspired. 18. Oh no, d4. Sorry, not a four, but d4. 17. He's going too. Does it see us? I will tell them, all right? I'll point back to them and I will bring out my little piece of fabric. Wait. No, it's a piece of wire and whisper into it and send a Message to Caleb that We've been made. Start making your way down here. (laughter) Are we sticking? He said "Come back to us." I feel like we're already here, we should just-- oh gods. What do we do? What does that mean? (laughter) Why are you big men making these weird speeches to me?! (laughter) I will fire, my hand-- how far? Yeah. I can make that shot. (ping!) (laughter) Ten. Is there a way to track the hit dice in (singing) D&D Beyond? Yeah, okay. All right. I can do it. Sure, 18 to hit. Five. Her forearms are amazing. Why did you drop a ball bearing down there? Don't do anything yet. We have to figure out what we're doing. Is she really royalty? Oh no! It's on! Do they know we're here now? It's just a bird. Should we all turn into birds and confuse him? We're going to go in or-- this doesn't seem very smart! I don't know. What is this blessing? Oh, okay. Thank you. No, they know we're here. Stay frosty? Stay frosty. I'll be back with Caleb. It's Crystal Pepsi. Nobody got 20 to 15? 11. Ten to 15. Ooh, boy. Ranged attackers. Guys, let's all cluster up at the bottom of the stairs. Devil sticks? Oh. Excuse me, pardon me, pardon me, excuse me. I'm going to cut through the front and go as far up the stairs as I can go. Take one shot, at the one who looks frosty. Yeah. (crossbow sound) Oh, boy, 12. (groans) I will, bonus action, go right back to where I was. Pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, pardon me. (imitating Laura) Climb up the stairs. Hello, gentleman. Shaka-pow. (whimpers) That's my turn. (laughter) Yeah, 24. Yeah! 12. Bonus action, I will cast Mage Hand and pull back the cloak around Shakäste's cloak, to see what's in his back pocket. You can use it as a bonus action. Then I will do this with my hand. 22. Anything off the belt, in the back pocket? It's assless chaps! (laughter) Okay. Good to know. That's my action; that's my bonus action. Those are the only hits he's had all campaign. It's another poo hole. Does that hit or not? You've got a staff. You can jam it into a thing on the way down. Just roll a natural 20. The pit is six feet deep. There's an old man down in the bottom of the pit. Turn, jump. Does that last a round? No one's in sneaky range. I'm going to caress the little pouch, little bit. Looking up to Caleb to see if he's looking at me at all. Trying to make good choices. I will leave the pouch and draw the hand crossbow and run up a few stairs and then I will crouch down on my knee and hold my attack until someone is within sneak attack range. 23. 15. (yelling) It was him! He did it! (yelling) I didn't get a letter! It's mostly cursing. Where does Shakäste? Where does Shakäste put the gold? Seven. We got all the ears? As the Duchess flies away, I push on Shakäste's body a little bit and see if I get any reaction. I'm going to pick the pocket of Shakäste. I will use sleight of hand to conceal this from the group. Okay. Yeah, okay, that's not great. 14. I'm going for that pouch. He doesn't know by whom! Just knows that it's happening? And can't react? Oh god. Get your medical kit ready. How big was the chamber? Oh my god. A visual? Matt, there's too many maps! That-- What?! We can't possibly kill whatever that beast is. But there's only two survivors in there, right? No, I mean, what if we just get the survivors out and leave? A baby should be with its mother. As long as they are close to each other. Stealthily. Wait, what's our plan? That's not a plan. No, to kill or to capture the-- Get the guards out and run? So who are we leaving back with the sticks? No! We should use the sticks to blow up narrow passage way so they can't get out! We should use them both! I'm in the middle. Are the good guys unconscious? Oh. Shit, so two people need to be on drag duty. I could try to untie them. I can sneak in down to those stalagmites. Yes. Okay. Can I have a ball bearing, please? Thank you. Yeah. I will cast Mage Hand and hold one ball bearing. I'm getting ready to move stealthily. In addition to the one we just made? 23. How do you see things? I can see the stalagmites? (scampering feet) Yeah. I'm going to-- Mage Hand's already cast. 30 feet. I'm going to drop the ball bearing right at the edge of that stair so it (tings). Who me? 15. I'm going behind those stalagmites over there. No, like-- Yeah. I'm going straight for the Mage Hand to untie them. Dexterity check. 18. Yeah, you're going closer? Jesus. 17. Oh my god, are you going to hit it with your sickle or whatever? Bonus action, use the Mage Hand to untie the other one. 19 plus four. (sighs) Should I waste my action on this shit? I'm still hidden, yeah? Another dude? Oh, you mean the bad guy. Yeah. Not another good guy. Or whatever, the civilians and say to him The second after the priest casts a spell, grab your friend and run. Nine. Then for my movement I'm going to tuck in even tighter. 3d10? Joke's on him, that's not a person. It's a half-orc. Wait, so the boys didn't get up and run as soon as the priest made his move? They're just lying there? What to do? I will run right past those two guards. As I go by, I say Get the fuck out of here! (laughter) Oh, sorry. No, I'm going to keep calling them guards. Bonus action dash up the steps. I'm going to turn around and yell at the manticore-- MARISHA and You want to save this thing? I will slice down with my short sword on the baby. Ooh. I mean, 14? Eight. It's 16. 2d6. No sorry, 17 damage. (screaming) Get the fuck out of here! Miss! So far. Sure, that hits. (whispers) One point. Yeah, leave, motherfuckers! Leave! She's got to grab Fjord! You're going to get the hit. With me, too. Yeah, that hits. (scream) The sticks! The dynamite sticks! No problem. It will be like a 12. Or the exact amount. That will release the Hold Person. He's got the Spiritual Weapon. Damn. The healer. You roll? You roll? Who rolls? Oh god, everyone's dead. (gasping) I just say to Beau The fuck?! (laughter) Oh, this is crazy. Sure. I will look up at the manticore, I'll take out my last shitty tart that you gave me, and crumple it onto the ground, and point up to the manticore and say What did the incontinent druid say on his surprise birthday party? I'm so excited, I wet my plants! (groaning) Yes, Hideous Laughter. 13. (cheering) You would have given it to us. I think it's like a black. I don't know. Matt, what is it? Or we could leave. Of what? LAURA and Or to leave. On the end of his turn, he gets to make a save. So he might save right now. You might not get that chance! It's the manticore's turn, and she might save right now! Yeah. I will jump down and run. Sure, if I still have a bonus action. Bonus action dash. Well, you know what? I'm going to stay within 30 feet of the priest. 35 feet of the priest. Was that a bonus action to use the weapon? So that worked? Oh, so you roll! Never better! That's huge. What's going on? Yes, fog monster. We're not going to take those giant manacles are we? It's huge, can we carry that? I can't carry it, that's how much I weigh. It's two horses. W.C and Crapper. We'll get back to you. He said to do that. He said to say that to the people. I stealthily take my bag of coin and slide it into his back pocket, and I pat it and say I got you some book money. Are you inviting us on your show? Is it a venereal disease? Nott the Stupid.
