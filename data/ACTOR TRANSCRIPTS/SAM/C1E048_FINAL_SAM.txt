Extra large! Fascinating. Wait, what? I didn't know that. Oh? What is it? Oh, a tiny poop. I'm in. And because of the Bluetooth feature, the NSA will track your every roll. Is it like Batman vs. Superman good? Hey, Wyrmwood crashed. Colbert Nation. Yes! I mean, we should check it out. It's a tent city? Hundreds, thousands? Oh, are we still mists? Oh my God. Good point. Oi. Old magic doll? Oh, yeah, magic door. Yes. I mean, I have a little Pike figurine that I keep with me. What, no, it's a keepsake! Why is everything I say creepy? I can fit many people into my hole. No, not quite. No, the house is mainly for us and a few guests, for one night at a time. 100 servants are in there. I don't quite-- I haven't jammed people in there. I don't know how many it can totally hold. First roll of the night Natural 20! (cheering) Like a flush. It's not a transporting-type spell. It is a temporary shelter, at best. I have a cold, cold heart. (laughter) Yes, sneaking up on them will definitely put them on our side. All right, all right. There are no woods, tall grasses I'm hiding in a tree. The grass to me is like a tree What, what what what what? God, you're so good at that. Wait, remind us, who-- ? Oh. I was mostly drunk that time. Doesn't he work for someone else? That's right! But he has magical items-- Had. Well, we should-- Yes, let's go in. I would love to sing. Oh. Right now? (singing) Sunny days, chasing the dragons away, On our way to where the air is clean, Can you tell me how to kill, How to kill some drag-eens? Performance check. It fell off the table. And it is-- a six. But plus 13. Wait-- plus 14. (singing) It's a magic carpet ride. Except we burned our magic carpet so we can't-- (laughter) Persuasion? You? Why don't you all lower your crossbows, for a second? Oh, Jesus. Okay. We know that you've been driven out of your homes by an attack of dragon or dragons. How many have menaced your city? How many are missing right now? If we found them, would you be more likely to take your people to somewhere safe? Boy. (laughter) Oh. Wait, we'd have to send them tonight, though. All right. What injured people are going back? Have we met these people yet? Can we meet them? I try to find the one who's the most able-bodied. Right? We're going to need someone to go find Pike or deliver a message, right? Is someone going who's not injured to transport these people? You remember what Pike looks like? Hair the color of the sunset, eyes like waves that crash in the night, breasts, supple, firm-- Smell of morning dew as it touches-- Oh boy. Keyleth, before we do this, there are no trees here. There's no forest here. Four days' journey. A giant tree. Oh, you're going to scout? Does the broom just fall, or does it shoot off like a missile? Oh, okay, that's cool. Two figures walking towards us? I draw my whip. Quall? To set it free, yes. Dagger Dagger Dagger is one of the shirts that's available. There's Strongjaw Ale. Strongjaw Ale available for sale. Check it out. Geek and Sundry. Master Quall. We're looking for the Vestiges of Divergence. Oh, am I not supposed to say that? Do you know where those are? That's what we want. If you can offer us one of those, we'll do business with you. Otherwise, we're going to fuck off. I am. Not them. We don't know where they are. We thought you might know. She is cute. She is being sought. What an entrance! Well, hold on, before we just say no, what's the reward? Do we know what you're paying for this? Actually, I pull Pike aside and say-- Well, not aside. I just ask her, how's Whitestone? What's going on there? No dragon attacks? You're giving this to us? You can trust us, as far as Grog can throw me. Or we could just send Vex on a broom right now to get it solo-- I think you can do it. I think you can do it. How about "The Hunk of Quall"? So, is the task then to go find the orcs that are keeping their people hostage up in the Frostweald? Yeah, it's a couple days from here? For mist form? Pike, can you make us mist? All right. With Vax? Oh, he's around. You know, he's probably just sulking. I didn't burn it. We're just going to walk? Do these refugees have any horses or anything? All right, we'll walk. You just saw all of his dirty dreams. Do we want camp, or do you want to sleep in a mansion? We can do it both. I can do it every day, right? I inherited some money. It's a long story. There was a great-uncle Vesuvius. The court said that he had to give me-- No. We'll sleep in the mansion tonight, and they all know where they're sleeping, but I'll personally show Pike to her chambers, which are right next door to mine at the end of the long hallway. My room, obviously, the biggest, tallest. Pike's a close second. Beautiful, covered in yellow rose petals as far as you can see. Mostly chicken. Please do. Blues, silvers. There's a little mini prayer area for her to pray to Sarenrae, and there's a little statue of Sarenrae, and if you pull it, a little secret door opens to my room. But it's a small door that only a gnome could fit through. Only on my side. I did it for you. And, hey, while we have a moment alone, can I just mention something to you? Listen, I'm not really concerned with other people's vices or bad behaviors, but Grog has this sword, and it's sort of not good. It could be used for good, possibly, but I'm just worried about it. Just keep an eye on it. I don't know what it is, and maybe you could just check it out next time you're friending it up with him. I don't want to judge him or what he does, but just make sure that it won't kill any of us. That's all I care about. Sleep tight. And if you hear any footsteps in your room, it's not me. It's the servants, I assure you. Of course. I'm just making the rounds, make sure everyone's tucked in for the night. You mean the all-purpose room? Don't look in there with a black light. It's all purposes, Percy. All purposes. But yes, it is a private room. No one can hear you scream in there. It's the farthest wing we have. I can give you some servants to help you set something up, bring in some tables, whatever. We don't have much in here, we're not prepared for chemical reactions. Do I have that stuff? Anything to help him? I tried to make enough stuff for all of us to have our basic needs met. All my anvils are gnome-sized. Are you going to have a working dinner? I'll send some chickens down. Oh, like you make tea with? I will command seven servants to each have a loaded chicken at the ready. Vax, you can do the honors and say the pulls. Vax is saying pull. Nine. (screaming) Can I pull out the arrow? I'm back. Thank you, Pike. All right. Well, let's say breakfast is over. Pull. Great job, Vex. Sure, sure. We're only eight hours away? All right, let's set out. If I leave it up, can anyone go in there? No, I'll shut the door and hide the key under a rock. We're going to the Stormcrest Mountains, right? Have we been there? 20. Let's go over. So then we're safe to move ahead? Pike's coming. Yes, please. 25. 12. Oh, that's my Ion Stone! Ioun Stone! Wow. Wow, we should probably try that out. Keyleth? Can you go lick that obelisk? How far are we? I'm going to just look around it for any traps. 18. Oh, you have to concentrate on it. Sure. These statues that have been broken. They have gashes and slashes in them? Okay. Hey, hey guys! Okay, everybody hey hey hey. That-- Are we having a short-- is this a short rest? Okay, this is it. Battle in the snow. But we've got Ashley. 19. Oh! Oh, great. It's right next to me? I'm averting my gaze. Well jeez, I mean, do I know where they are? So I kind of know where they are. All right. I'm going to hop away five feet from the guy who's-- I'm going to get an attack-- yeah, that's a fine direction, sure. Yeah. Yeah. (laughs) Okay. And I'm going to aim to the one in the middle there-- does anyone have a pointer? Yeah, that one. The other two are within 20 feet of him, yes? So I will cast a Wand of Fireballs right there on him. Just behind him so it hits all three? Yes? Oh! DC 15! I wrote it down. 25! I'll tuck around the obelisk a little bit. And I'll turn to Pike, my love, and inspire her with a song. I will sing, (singing) I used to scry you on the shit phone... (laughter) Whoa! 43?! Ugh! My eyes... Oh, it's a save! That's right! How so? They don't have eyes, or something? Wait, what does that mean? I'm scared. One's next to Grog. But it's also looking cool. Starring Ashley Johnson! Blindsight! Matt, you're the worst. Yeah, Keyleth, good one! 4d10 is a lot! No, she did 4d10. Which one, the one near Grog or the one near scorpion-face? Wait! You're inspired! I'm not only averting my gaze, I'm looking towards the holes that it came out of, any of the holes that are near me. Okay, I'm going to go over to one and throw a Fireball down into it. Yes. Seven. 29. So the tunnels nearest me are not accessible anymore. All right. I'll spend the rest of my time in this round licking my wounds and studying the obelisk to see if I can see any other clues or anything on it. I can't read it, though. Is it a hole, or is it...? I throw a snowball in it. It's safe, guys. Two natural ones? Good. Oh, god, Keyleth, you're horrible! Oh, wait, no, you've turned back to normal. They're friendly! How long can you hold that? What is this obelisk? It seems important if these things are protecting it. What does it say? Should we say a name to it and see what happens? That's right, that's right. Why don't you say it into this triangle hole over here? Elvish is just English except muffled. I don't know what's in the hole. Nothing. Whack-a-Mole! Grog! Whack-a-Mole! 59? Wow, you're catching up to Pike! I'm going to take my Ioun Stone and shove it in the hole. 17. Ashley Blindsight? That was today, wasn't it? You can't unlearn things! It's all good. DM, can I experiment and take away, if I take away my Ioun Stone, does the light fade? Wait, before we leave, is there anything else we need to do here? Do we need to go down into the tunnels? Do we need to piss on the obelisk? Do we want to do anything? Let's go. Wait, we need some basilisk blood and stuff! We have Pike with us! One hand. Oh, shit. What happened? Are they stone? Everything is going to be okay. These escorts you had with you who were also turned to stone, were they important to you? Were they friends of yours? He has knowledge of the area. Oh, Grog. Untested high-level spell? Do it! Yes. You're lucky to be alive, and now you're going on an adventure with us. Hey, who has two thumbs and is really excited? You and me, both doing this. Charisma? 20. We'll be fine. Let's go. Good talk. Hey, Pike, good job tonight, lady! You brought a guy back to life! You're super strong! Is next week any-- It's not our 50th episode? Last time in our 40s.
