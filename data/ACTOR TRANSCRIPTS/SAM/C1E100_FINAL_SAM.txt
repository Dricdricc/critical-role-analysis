I'm sorry! The intensity. The glamor. 400 thread count. (laughter) Is it a baked good of some sort? Oh, hello there. I'm Taryon Darrington of The Slayer's Cake. The Slayer's Cake, your pals in a pastry pinch. Go now? Okay. (clears throat) Heading to a fancy banquet and not sure if your hosts are undead? (gasps) Slayer's Cake. Say it's Winter's Crest, and you don't know what to get your secret Sarenrae. Possibly because you've never given a gift before. It could happen. Slayer's Cake! We even have miniature cakes for that special gnome-one in your life. Oh, okay, well, I mean, mm! But hey, if I still haven't convinced you, don't take my word for it! Are we still-- So come on down to the Slayer's Cake, located in downtown Whitestone. Look for the big unsanitary bear. You can't miss it! And don't forget, don't step in bear shit! Wyrmwood's has always been Critrole, hasn't it? Matt, that soda pop looks like you're drinking it out of a wine glass. Okay. Halfway through announcements. He's jacking in. We've gone through the Sun Tree or not? I should note that Doty is coming with us as well. It was just ten days, first of all. I am very powerful, but there's some things that I can't do, all right? Ever since you found out I was short, you're much snappier and snippier with me. Maybe I should. Yeah, because I'm known around these parts, so that would probably be better. I'll put on the hat and become the Meat Man. I have many places. Get off! Get off! Stop it! Oh, she's speeching. The Meat Man does not hug. Yes. Scanlan stepped out. Tary's in. Come with me. Was that a fart? How are things in my absence? Oh, yes, yes, that's right, yes. Any new reports of the hooded people? No fraternizing. No. I will just walk by him and go down into the hidey-hole. Bit of warning. Don't use her name. All right, so I'll just walk up to them. Yeah, sure. I do not raise my hand. No, no. Sorry about that. Is anyone in the room, now, Matt, besides-- All right, so. We can drop all of the illusions. They all know what's going on now. Even Chod. I went to get them to tell them about the thing that we found. I was going to escort them there. Do you think you have things handled if we go for a day? Sorry, I didn't know you were throning. Well, when we're in command, yeah. Not true, not true. No, I didn't, I came to make sure you were all right, and is everything all right? Have we heard of any other attacks or incidents? Yeah, the ones in the mountain, in the cave. What about buyers? Have we had any new interest? Just remind him to put some imperfections in it. He always likes to make things too beautiful. We want to sell real things, not things that look like they're brand-new. If things are really old, they have dents and scuffs on them. You should trust me because I pay you. All right, so we'll be gone-- we've rested recently, right? So we'll be going for a while, and just hold down the fort while we're gone. Also, I know it sounds stupid, but can you look into getting a few ducks? Just as pets? Yeah, I know. It's just a thank-you. Yes. Just ask, just ask us and that would be fine, too. You should always assume she's fucking with you. Every time. If he does, we'll just eat the ducks. Sure. Okay. Do any of you need any supplies or anything before we go? Are we good to travel on foot?" Healing potions? I can heal with my words. Why would I need healing potions? No, I don't have any of those. But it can be arranged if you are short. I can have my second here look into it for you. Crutch, will you-- That's gold. No, you cannot buy any. But the Crutch here will look into it while we're gone. We won't have any until we get back, though. No, we have to just go. Of course. Jack off, jack off, jack off! I know I've been rather quiet this journey, but I could just provide us with a few more, if that would help things-- Yeah, sorry, it's odd for me. I will rip off my last remaining potion patch on the robe, which has four small healing potions. So we have seven regular healing potions. The weather is certainly dry. Yes. I certainly have. It's good to be back, but I'm a little nervous. I don't know why, really. Yes. New dynamic. Only because it's under the Helm. Believe me, it's a nightmare in there if you look underneath. Unfortunately, yes. (laughter) There's nothing to wait for. What are we talking about now? That's an attunement item. We don't need that shit. Let's go. All right. On we go. (screams) Why am I playing the tree? Oh, okay. Yes. They are definitely making fun of you. We can't really do that. We need to know where the tree is that we're going to be going to. I haven't been there, have I? I have not been to the place we are going. I do not know of any tree. Not too many. We're ten exactly. That's ten, isn't it? 290 miles. We don't at all. Not at all. 15 plus something. Minus one. 14. Doty has low-light vision, I think. It's dark. It's a miracle! To the duck? Sure, sure. Are there any people around? Wait, wait, wait, before you do that, are you sure that's-- You're going to just shoot something in there? What if they see it fly in? Keep him honest. Good old four-Luck O'Brien. I don't even know if you guys want me to come in with you. I've taken you this far. But if you need me in there, I'll come. All right. Let's make a hole and go in, and then we can camp the night inside. No, do not do that. I, Scanlan Shorthalt, can go get it, if you'd like. I can go get it if you'd like. It's easy. I'll be there and back in two seconds. You're an expert marksman, you know. Within 100 feet? Yeah, how about this? Why don't you shoot an arrow right now, outside the cave, same strength, and see how far it goes? I have ways. You want to come? The way I always go. Dimension Door. It can't. I assume. Great. You can't. I'll just go. Dimension Door 400 feet straight in. 30. Go back? Will you hold my hand? It was very dusty in there. Soft un-tread earth. No, I forgot. I was looking for the arrow. That was our mission. Are we trying to dispel the magic or are we going in the other way? Maybe we should just make a decision. Well, if he's going in, Taryon will go in and Identify the thing. 17, but I've got Identify. So it's one-time use, so we're good to go in this way if we'd like. Should we use our flashlights or no? Doty's going to click his boots of whatever. His boots of elven... Yeah, elvenkind. Scanlan got 29, Taryon got 25, and Doty got a two, but with his boots-- what do his boots do? Shit! Okay. 17! Plus ten, yeah. Do you want to stop and camp? I feel like good old Chod should be near the tip of the spear since he knows the inside of this place a bit. Taryon next, with Doty with him. Scanlan will be in the rear. Fine, if Matt wants to change the rules 100 games in, I guess so. Right now I'm looking at the back of Grog's ass. But I got a 19. For the door? The mansion? Okay. It takes a minute to cast. Do you want me to? That's 100,000 dollars, yo. Six figures, moving your direction! I mean, you told me to do this, right? Okay. I'm out of the fight, then. So I'll start casting and singing. (sings) When people keep repeating that you need a place to sleep, when everybody starts retreating but you need a really cool keep, let Scanlan open the door. Let Scanlan open the door! Let Scanlan open the door to your house! And an idiot shall lead them. A gif of cording. Probably a minute. I put some new art pieces in here. They're all counterfeit, but still good. The menu's changed quite a bit. Kaylie got sick of chicken about two weeks in, so she's got me on this vegan thing. (sighs) She says it'll make me last longer and feel healthier and stuff. Well, you know. Live longer. She said all that meat was probably bad for me, so it's all salads now. Yeah. Different kinds of salad. That's what she told them to make, and that's what they're making now. Well, I don't want to cross her. She has me on a diet, and I'm trying to stick to it. It will be all salad. Tasteful? Yeah, sure. It's there. Maybe we should all retire to our rooms for a while and come back for dinner. Oh, that's the fancy fellow you've brought with you. The new Scanlan. Yeah, right. Hello! I'm Taryon Darrington. I've been quite pleased to spend some time with your friends for the last year, and it's-- you have wonderful friends. You should honor and cherish them. They are the best people I've ever met in my life, and this is a lovely home you have. (sighs) It's nice to meet you, too. Thank you for looking after my friends. I guess any friend of Vox Machina is a friend of mine. You can use the downstairs. The basement room. No. I don't have bunkbeds. No, I don't think I do, but there might be some spare cots and stuff downstairs. Yeah. It was destroyed but rebuilt. It's lined with iron now, in case there's an explosion. Yeah. Sure! That will be great. That will be fine, yeah. Let's go. Maybe he's born with it. Well, to be fair, you hadn't spent a lot of time in my room. I need to get every angle, don't I? Sure. Rummy gin? Gin rummy? Pinochle? Spades? Hearts? Okay. I'll deal. I will win. I mean, there's a lot to talk about in a year. We-- We went on sort of a walkabout. Me and Kaylie went off to the woods, did some camping. We found some travelers and sang to them, and told stories like we do. Entertained some folks. Some nights were spent alone, some nights in the company of people who wandered by. We weren't too far away from Whitestone. After about a month or two of being hobos, I guess, she wanted to do something. You know, anything. She was getting bored, she's young. So I told her, I don't really have anywhere to go, but I do know of two fuckfaces I have to get revenge on. I asked her if she'd be interested in that, and she said, fuck yeah! So she came down with me. We got a boat, went across the sea, and we went back to that casino. It was really the only piece of unfinished business from our time together that I had to deal with. Well, when I got my revenge on them, I learned a bit about what they were up to. They weren't really drug dealers. It's embarrassing, but the drugs they sold me were not real. I know that's hard to believe, but I was swindled by them. It is true. They sold me a bunch of shit. But they were in this other game, of selling counterfeit stuff. So I did the thing that I knew would hurt them most. I took away their counterfeiter, and now he works for me. So I put them out of business, and I put me into business. And since then I've been doing that for a while, and it turns out I'm very good at it. We don't try to swindle people who are innocent. We started off by taking down-- well, not taking down, but ripping off a few guys who were corrupt officials in the city, and built from there. It's not a big operation, if I can be honest with you. It's just me and Kaylie and a few other people. Thank you. It is kind of cool. I have this persona, and people know who it is, and when I go places, they're scared of me a little bit. That's true. I helped, a bit. I don't know, maybe. We all did our part. We all did our part! I don't know what that game is. But, I know, I know. Listen, I did a lot of thinking over the year, and I-- Yeah. I appreciate you all much more now than I did, and I realize that you probably appreciated me, too, but at the time I just didn't know. I was so used to being a loner that I didn't know really how to behave in a group, that's all. So I left. Really? That's not true. You don't have to apologize for anything. It was me. It was me, and I don't know if we'll ever have what we had before, but I can tell you that fighting alongside you all was the best time of my life, and not because of the glory, or the fortune, or the fame that we got. It was just to fight alongside you, and to see the looks on your faces when I did something really cool in battle. But you've got this new guy, and he seems really-- He's very handsome. Oh, really? Zephra Heights? You are happy? That's so weird. But still with the black. You're not giving that up. I mean, some turquoise could pop it up a little bit. That's true. How's that all going? Yeah? I'm certainly better off than I was when I left you all. I don't know that I'm happier, just better off. Most certainly. Listen, thank you for coming up here and stuff. I don't really know what to do with the others. I'll try. I can't reach. You too. I'm sorry. We're not going to play cards, are we? Yeah, okay. Sure. Yeah, you should just go. I mean, yeah. I hadn't intended on it, but there's definitely a mirror in there. There's lima beans. No, the closest we have is lima beans. If I have them make chicken, they'll tell her, and I'll get in trouble. Don't do it. Listen. They make a great cucumber salad. They've got an excellent endive. A couscous. And a tabbouleh. Yeah, it's really not filling at all. It's terrible. For what? I mean, if we all rest, when we wake up, those things are gonna be swarming outside the door, right? We can do that. Maybe we should sleep. No, they have to be invited. For a while. Oh, no. We're fucked. They can make you a fruit smoothie. She said vegan. No eggs. Yeah, sure. Yeah, that's a thing. Oh, shit. Wait, we're all still eating breakfast? Oh, God. The door's open. I'm at the door. I'll step out into the fray just to watch. I saw. (laughter) He's so strong. I've never seen anyone so strong and powerful before. Yes! Six. That one's cocked, reroll it. Six. (laughter) As he rolls, I will inspire him. I'm going to sing-- Oh well, that's fine, that's fine. Okay, that's not as good. To this? 15. Five plus ten. Chod, that was amazing. You slew those skeletons like they were nothing. Incredible. Yes. It's good to have someone like you by our side. Are you drinking it or just pouring it all over you? Are we all back in the mansion? I think I know what's going on. Grog. Grog, Pike, can I say something? I feel like there's some tension between us and we need to clear the air if we're going to go fight today. You guys are really bad today. Well. And I think it's because I haven't made you feel at ease. So can I please just take a moment before we go out there and just, for once and for all, say I'm sorry to you guys for what I did and how I left things. I said things that were really cruel and meant to hurt you, and that's wrong and I'll probably regret it for the rest of my life. But I needed to go and I just didn't know how to express myself. And I'm so sorry that I insulted you. Pike, I've said awful things to you for as long as we've known each other, and I can't take them back, but I can at least try to be a better person. And can I confess something to you? During the last year, I've-- I think I've been praying. I mean, I just talk at night and nobody hears me, but I guess that's praying, right? And sometimes I talk to Sarenrae, because that's the only one I know. And she seems cool. And she seems like someone who could be a good guide. And it feels good. And I even wrote a little poem about her and about her teachings. It's very simple, but can I tell you it? It's really simple. It goes "Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something. "Everybody love, everybody know, how it go." I know it's stupid, but there's a certain Logic to it. It makes me feel connected to you guys, even though you're not there. So I say that to myself every night before I go to sleep. Yeah. And Grog. I can't apologize to you, because words don't work. I wasn't going to. I was just going to give you a gift. Because the times we had together were the best times ever. You might be a little slow. But you're the best friend I ever had. And our times together were great, not because of our conversations, or our witty repartee. It was because of the fun we had together and the experiences we had. So last night, I wrote something for you. I know you can't read, but-- I just got you a gift. Because if you won't spend time with me now, maybe you'll be able to spend time on your own. So I wrote you this. Maybe someone else can read it for him. There's really long words. Nope. Nope. It's Elvish. Grog, I love you. I'm sorry that we won't get to hang out, because you hate me now. But I would never replace you. And if you ask me right now-- I will kill him. Will you go drinking with me some time? Is that true? LAURA and He sang? A truthful check? Sure, I'll roll a truthful check. Natural 20. I'm so sorry I missed it. And I hope someday we'll sing together, in a drunken stupor together. Maybe that will remind you. I was an asshole, Grog, I'm sorry. I would never, never replace you, ever. You're irreplaceable. That's incredible. I had some time last night. Listen, we need to go kill some things right now, but I just want to say to all of you, I'm so sorry the way I left, it was awful of me. Percival, I said awful things to you, I said awful things to all of you. But just know I've done and said worse things to Kaylee, and she's forgiven me, and I've done and said worse things to myself, and I've managed to forgive myself, and I hope that someday, you'll all be able to forgive me. And until then, I'll just keep trying, and that's all I can do. And after this fight, if you want me to stay, and you guys go home, that's fine. But if not, maybe we can start over. (whispering) You've seen that? You've seen that? Those are the guys? (whispering) We should kill him. Let's go kill them. Maybe we should all go. Wait, are we all going? Did everyone else leave? If he's going, I'm going. Natural 20. Taryon's still asleep. Dickbutt. Hey, in the store tonight, we've got lots of-- (as Tary) 34, 35. Other side, Doty. One. Hello? Yes? I'm not decent yet. Come in, come in. Hello. Of course. I'm doing my daily preparations. I had to pluck my eyebrows, I had to comb my hair. My unmentionables needed to be washed and-- Yes. I will identify these objects. Oh, oh. I'm jacked in. Oh my god, there's so many items. What we have here is a Scimitar of Speed. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns. But maybe this guy can do it. We've also found the Third Eye of Awareness. A single polished stone of smooth jade is affixed to a grey leather band that loops in the back. The wearer gains advantage on initiative. (gasps) Oh. Little Elf Girl. No, it's a leather band. Of course Vex gets this. All the times we've had together. The last item is called the Iron Bands of Bilarro. This rusty iron sphere measures three inches in diameter, and weighs one pound. Like my dick. (laughter) You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a huge or smaller creature, like my dick, that you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands, like my dick. Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your dex modifier plus your blah blah blah, if you hit it, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak a command word and release it. Doing so, or missing, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more. So it's like a trap ball. Trap ball. Once the band is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn, like my dick. It's just that gnome, he's so weird and he rubs off on people, like my dick! Oh, I'm doing it again! Well, it seems like you guys are working through a thing, and I should really be getting back home, anyway. I don't know, I don't feel quite as needed any more. How did he get in here? After this is all done, I'll say my proper goodbyes. But I should be going. He's your best guy, right? You need him. He's part of the team, he always has been. I love you both. I'm definitely poorer for having known you, though. That's true. All right, I'll come outside. Doty, get my armor ready. Spritz it! His armor! Let's go kill some shit, shall we? Come on! Codeword? 20, 23, 23. Scanlan, Taryon, Doty. I tried to leave them behind, guys! Let's go! Everybody. Saving throws are up there. Great. That's the third one, then? Scanlan, 26. Is it 18 points? Taryon, 26. Doty, one. You said 18? Why would you do that, and what happened? All my people to the right. Guys. So many great things available in the store tonight. Those posters? The Scanlan thing. Oh shit. An overhead cam? An out-of-focus overhead cam? Matt only has to manage 22 individual characters right now. We'll just say leeward and windward. Starboard. We killed her! She's dead! She's dead. She died. We killed her! This is like a soap opera! 20 for Scanlan. No, mine's just 20. Wait, does Doty roll? I forget. No, he just goes when Taryon does. Taryon's 16. 16 for Taryon. What did you get? He got 17. Did he tell you? She's mad. All right. I'll step forward and I will-- is Vax or Vex near me? Vex is near me, right? I will inspire Vex. I will sing to her. I will sing, (singing) you don't need anybody else. When I stand beside you, I touch you, elf. Whoa. (laughter) And then I'll cast Reverse Gravity on everybody. Everybody in there. All their shit. 50 feet. 50 feet radius. 22. Does it affect people in the dome? Oh boy, Matt's hating this. I just need to hear it more, guys. Maintain! The people inside the dome? No. Oh, that ziggurat. I'll move a little closer in. Done. Percival. Oh shit, it affects the area? Oh, that's a one. Doty, stay here. I'll jump on the broom. I cast Fly on-- no, I don't have to cast Fly. I'm on a broom! Well, Matt does it all the time. I'm going to fly straight in to the steps. Can I get there in one fly? It's 40, right? I can't get all the way there, so I'll cast something. Shit. It's a prismatic thing, right? Would a Prismatic Spray beat a Prismatic Spray? Probably not, right? Shit. I'm not going to risk it. I'm going to point straight up. Is there anyone right above me? And I'm up a bit, so I could throw something at them? I guess drop it. I'll drop a thing of fire up there. Alchemic fire. A little pot. Can I get two of them? It has a five-foot radius. Great. I'll go for both of them. 17. I'm 15th level or 16th level? Okay. 5d6. 16. I will, as a bonus action, cast Sanctuary. Am I within 30 feet of any of my friends? On myself. Am I close to him? I'll Counterspell that. Sure. It's just a plus two? Oh, wait. Wrong guy! Ooh, 19. I don't feel the love! I need to go away for another year. Laura, did you roll? 24. Plus anything? Constitution saving throw. It's a lot. 22 on the first one. 13 plus seven. 20. Does Doty get hit? He's out. Wait, how many points? Wait, she goes through the thing?! All it ever has been. I don't have much. Who's with me? Who's near me? Nobody, right? I can't do anything to Pike or with Pike. (fake sobs) All right. I'll inspire myself. The saddest inspiration. (singing) It's raining gnomes. Hallelujah, it's raining gnomes. Everywhere we go. Short, stout, tough, and mean. The handsomest I've ever seen. I'm going to Dimension Door into the orb, into the whatever this thing is. The prismatic ball. I can do it at will. So will you. Not into the orb of death. Two. Oh, wait. Plus six. That's eight. Plus, I'm inspired. Ten. So 18. 18. Acid, I get halved. I thought Dimension Door, I disappear to another plane and reappear. All right. Keep it coming. 16. No, keep it coming. I got this. What do you mean, passing through? I can take it, Matt. Bring it! 500 feet. 15. I still have my inspiration. 18. Great. Great. And my bonus. Yeah, that's it. That's all I've got. I can't see the danger I'm in. I don't think I can get through that thing, can I? I'll fly up closer to the orb. Oh. Where are they? They're right above me? Oh. Well, then I'll attack them, I guess. How wide is my Prismatic Spray cone? It's just the standard Prismatic Spray spell. Will it hit the protective thing, as well as the people on the ceiling? I'm mainly aiming at the two dudes above. A d8? Just 1d8? Oh, that's right, to pick the color. Four. Seven. Two. Five. Okay. (counting) 39. Yeah, pretty much. Oh, and I'll fly closer to the sphere. I said that already. We're onto our bonus material. Off a duck's back? Oh mallard. I said, oh mal-lard. Oh mallard. You can't do anything? Does Feeblemind end? Not great. Five. No, it's gone, you're done. Am I still there? I will draw my blade and scream and hit that thing with my sword. No, the guy! The guy, not the orb. Jon's dice. 11 plus I think it's ten. Somewhere. It's just a sword; it's not even magical now. Shit, I can't find anything, I think it's 1d8 plus two. 1d8 plus three. Right? I can't even find it. I think it's one, but this is an old sheet. Thank you. Seven. Plus one. So eight damage. I'll just stab him in his toes over and over and I'll say, this is what you get for separating me from my friends! Who I want to be around forever because I love them! Is this what we're supposed to do now, is this the thing? Okay. Yeah, my friends! What if it's just her soul or something? I'm a little worried that once we walk outside, Pike becomes dumb again. We have to go at least find out if the spells are still affecting us. If we go through and Pike's dumb-- By the way, while this is going on, I'm dragging Doty out.
