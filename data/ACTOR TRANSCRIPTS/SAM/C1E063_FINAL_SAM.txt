All right, so that place over there, the hut. I think it was not a good idea to go over there. I think it's one of the things that what's-his-fuck warned us about. Yes. I don't know. I wasn't really paying attention. Something about a hut. Yeah, that's probably Wodenna. So why don't we go around the hut? Is that possible? Is Garmelie gone? Oh yeah. So? We're big and scary. She's a little old lady. But maybe she could help us in a way. It's like that urge when you're standing at the edge of a cliff, like part of your body wants to jump a little bit? I kinda wanna go in there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have a javelin of lightning? Why have you never used a javelin of lightning? Thank you! That's one better than before! New dice. 30. Something I said. You've yet to break single digits with them. Northwest. Absolutely. Drakkar. Sorry. That is true. Sit on your shoulder straps. All right, all right. Thank you for the lift. That's good. Yes, we should go around. We could kill them quite easily. What? Oh, shit. To what end? Then we're just gonna sit here forever? I am a backpack right now. Could you be, please? I'm just a passenger. I'm on you. If you're not going up, I'm staying on you. We're gonna-- We're standing our muck. I'm back here! I'm back here, I'm back here, I'm back here! It's me. Don't back up into a tree-- I'm still back here! I'm still back here! Also has the mind of an ape. No, I don't-- Thank you. Stick to the plan. I'm with you now? There's a punk band warming up. (All laugh.) We have the mansion. How many hours since we've slept last? So we can at least do some, we can get closer and do some recon. (worried noise) Wait, tre-- oh. Above the tree, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Eight. (All laugh.) Just 'cause. I'm using my eight perception, I report to the others, it's just a normal tree, guys. (All laugh.) Sure. Sounds good to me. While we still have a, I'll phone down to Vex and Vax and Percy and say, while we still have a giant eagle, is there any point to us, to me and Kiki scanning back to where those trolls were and just making sure they're not following us or anything? A log? (screams as though falling) Oh, okay. Should we-- Yeah? Okay. Other than it being black magic? So we're doing this now? Well, no, I-- Wait, wait! I will too. You're dead, sir. I got a 23. Hey, buddy! Okay. Okay, I'll do the mansion. Yeah, that's true, that's true. I will cast the mansion. I will sing the song to conjure it. (Sings) Home, home on the range, where the trees are acting real strange, where chickens are pecked, Vex shoots me in the neck, and the hot tub is filled with grenades. (All laugh and applaud.) I command my servants to wipe our feet. Oh, go out and test it? Grog? I'm gonna inspire him once with an inspirational quote. You have to look through the rain to see the rainbow. (All laugh.) Hey, pal. Life is what happens when you're making other plans. If plan A doesn't work, there's still 25 letters left in the alphabet. It was my footprints you saw. I was carrying you all along. I'm going out as well and I'm just sort of shuffling in place and moving. Oh yes, that would be better. I have a training basement, but okay, sure. Seems like it's normal. Yes, that would be lovely, thank you. Will you tell me a story? Wait, hold up. You know what, we should've definitely tied that rope to her before-- God, what is she doing? Dick joke. Did the muck try to eat you? But you felt the roots, it's not an illusion, it's a real tree. Okay. Hmm. What a good word. Yeah, I guess we should go in and see what going on, what's cooking in the kitchen. Damn it. Grog, what are you doing? This is our kitchen and we need to eat dinner here! I didn't intend to, but Grog has forgotten that I have a whole training ground downstairs that he could've used. Grog, if you need to hit something, someone, I can give you a few of the servants. Sure, I've got like a hundred of them. You guys don't mind, do you? Have a dozen. Baker's dozen. The damage, I believe, I've never seen damage this bad in our place before, but. I believe it will reset. It goes back to normal at the end. I haven't been down to the spa in a while. You have to try harder, Grog. I thought that would work, honestly. We usually have one cow. Before you beat this poor senseless cow-- I've got an idea. I can fix this, Grog, I want you to be a satisfied customer. Let's go downstairs. Okay. I take him downstairs. I say, you're gonna punch me and keep punching me as long as you can. All right? And I transform into a triceratops. Birthday. I mean, (growls) I'm gonna fight back a little. Wait, wait, did it work? Are your gauntlets better or whatever you're trying to do? Am I okay? You know what, Grog, you could, it might make you feel better if you repaid the favor. I've been meaning to try to upgrade Mythcarver. All right, I'm gonna do a stab. I'm gonna sing a note and see if this does anything to Mythcarver. I'll just go (sings a note) and I'll try and jam it through his arm. 18 plus nine. Uh, not much. 1d8. Three, six, plus one... ooh, nine! And I will sing as I withdraw it as well. (sings a note) Do I notice any change in the weapon? Damn it. But it hurts you! All right. All right, one more time. I'll do some like Black Sabbathy sort of (heavy metal screaming). All right. 18 plus nine. Ooh, yeah, that's better. SAM and 15. All right. I withdraw. And any change? Ah, damn it. All right, forget it. I know, these suck. I don't know. Wish there was a manual. Anything on mine? Nothing. I know Common and Gnome. We're about to take a rest. He did that to everybody's room, just in case. Hey! Wow, those dice. Sunlight and water. That's so poetic. Don't worry, Pike can... oh. Oh, okay. How about holy water? No. Have you been talking to any of the trees around here? Right around here? Is the big tree eating you all? Is that a tree? Ooh, like American Beauty? Chicken? Sondur? Poovah. (All laugh.) Has it been eating you? Is it a tree? Good question. Yes. What did he say? Sondur. Flight of the Sondurs? Do any of us recognize the word? Sondur, Syldor, they're brothers. Isn't that how it works? Do I? With books? Of course I have a library! It's in my personal chambers where I do all of my studying. Only in the back. It's all over the floor of the kitchen. So what's our plan? Do we attack this thing with brute force? How do we corrupt the ground? You can turn the ground to stone, will that help anything? Right? That's a lot of tree to search, it could be way up, it could be in a branch. It says it now acts as the heart to a cancerous tree corrupting the verdant land. We can go to my library. Maybe? Marisha writes down everything. The bigger question is how does she find it. I know that Simon's mom is Elwen. I know that... I know that there's a hatmaker named Deirdre somewhere in the world. Did you roll it? Well, that's something. There you go. So we're fighting an archfey inside a tree. We gotta get the archfey out of the tree. What's its name again? Sorry. Sondur. Yeah, sure. Hey, Sondur, Sondur, give us your bow. What are we asking the tree? Yeah, but what are we-- We're just gonna say hey, Sondur, how can we help you? We're fanboys. Great. That sounds like it's gonna end well. Okay. Chicken-skin bacon. Lootcrate, lootcrate, lootcrate. All right, eat up, let's go. We go out into the world, right? Oh! Those are terrible shoes. Yeah, describe them. Maybe now would be, we're going straight to the tree, right? Should any of us hide? Crystal what? Don't do it. All right. Yeah, anyone want to go stealth or anything? It's just gonna be all of us presenting ourself? All right. Don't do stealth, I'll present us all as a group. We have no plan. So let's just walk right up. I take, me and Keyleth take tip of the spear, and we just walk right up to the base of the tree. Scanlan and Keyleth first. As we approach, I take a little muck and I'm going to draw like a little tree on my forehead and one on Keyleth's forehead as well. Just like a little mud tree on your forehead. Don't worry. It's for a good cause. Just a little bit. I call out to it. Sondur! Sondur, hear us! We are your devotees! We have come to pay homage and respect to you. We follow your ways and your teachings. We wear your mark on our heads to show respect. Please show us your power and grant us your blessings. Okay. Question one. Wow. Straight to it. Just straight to it. Just go straight for... I wanna spend the night with you. Just straight there. Coming in? All right. Wait, you're going in? Going with Kiki. Your Pokeball. Do you want to stay outside? Mayonnaise. Mayonnaise is slippery. Butter. And me second. The whispers, the whispers. Oh my gosh. Oh boy. Ordinarily I would plug Lootcrate right here, but this is too tense. Way too tense, yeah, I'm too nervous to remember the three-dollar-a-month discount that you would get by signing up-- What do you mean? There's creatures? Who? Ah, Matt. I will, I'll try one more time and just say, Sondur, we are... Sondurites, here to pay homage to you. Please, show yourself and make us feel your presence. (whispering) It's our sign! Sure, I'll bow as well. Nope. He just wanted a kiss and you shot him! Just a lonely guy. You did great. Oh, god. What, were you gonna give him a hug and get possessed forever? Because we're terrible people. 15. At least five a session. Did a fan give that to you? Oh, shit! How do you want to do this? Count 20. Lair actions. 20 total. It's dying. Music help! If anyone works for Apple and wants to send us all new iPads. (All laugh.) Better? Better! Forget those iPads. Is he casting a spell? I will attempt to Counterspell it. I'm gonna go at level five. Level five. What do I, d20 plus six? 24. Yeah. Return? But he's just used them! He's getting that invisible figurine that he has. Oh, hi. Hi, friend. Bramble-shot. Sounds tasty. Hi, hi Liam. Yes! Yes, for once. Nah, you'll be fine. (whispering) She's dead. She's dead. She's definitely dead. Oh my god. God, this is a tough one. Hey! Preference? I'm gonna go for the big guy. All right. I'm gonna go a couple steps to the right, like split the difference between me and Percy. I will cast, I will use the wand of... well, jeez, lightning or fire, lightning or fire. Wand of fireballs, I'll use three charges. At the big guy upstairs. Yeah. 15. I'm going to use three, I get three charges and then two more is five... yeah, five. Yes, five. So it's 10d6. Okay. Six, eight, 14, 16, 17. 23... 28, 32. 33. Halved. Yeah, I'll use a bonus action, gah, do I heal or do I inspire? What's more helpful here? I will heal Percy a little bit. I can only cast Healing Word at level one as a bonus action, right? Oh, okay. Oh, that's true. Okay, well then I'll do it at, uh, level two. I don't know what I'm gonna need today. It's 2d4 plus five. I do. Ooh! Oh, nice. I will sing to him, let's see if I can do this. "Come on, come on, get your Scanlan on, it's Thursday night and it won't be long, gonna play my flute, play my shawm, it's Thursday night and it won't be long 'til I get your health up, get your health up, I got all you need, no I don't shoot bows, I don't swing swords, but damn I can sing." (All cheer.) 4d4 plus six. Er. Four plus six, ten. Ten, ugh! I already moved a little bit, I'm gonna stick right there, yeah. Have you done that before? You're Johnny Storm? We brought a gun to a tree-fight. (All laugh.) Also, if it's a tree it instantly dies. A billion. How's the Sky bar? I guess I will try to counterspell this one as well. Also at level five, I don't know if that helps. All right. Plus six? 16. Oh, am I rolling for-- What is the save? Dexterity saving throw. 14. How high's the roof above the ground? Two 50 drops. 24. Oh! Poor guys. No problem, no problem. This is one of the treants? Oh, okay. Strength. Oh, god. Just straight strength? 15. Tense fight, guys. Wouldn't wanna be in it with anyone else. I think that my plan should work. Oh boy. Hey, damn! Okay. I'm against the close side of the wall. Can I pull out a wand, or not even? All attacks. Even spell attacks? That's attack rolls, Fireballs just happen. I'll do Fireball on the treant. I'll aim it far away enough so that it won't hit us. Is that a thing? Is that possible? Can I go up? Well, yeah, but I don't know how-- Got it. Got it. All right. Then I will not risk it and I will just Fireball good old Sondur, I guess. I'll use three more charges. I have seven total. Total. So I've used three. I thought the first one is just three balls? No? I don't know how this shit works. I don't have it anymore. I lost it months and months ago. (All laugh.) So I used three charges. Okay, so I'm gonna use three on him. Laura, are you like... All right, that was 29. So 14. I will also heal Vex. She's close enough, right? Yeah? Yeah? Ish? With an inspirational quote. Something Percival once said a long, long time ago. Life needs things to live. That's it. That's the whole quote. (All laugh.) Oh, and I'll do it at level three, so that's, sorry, not inspiration, healing, healing, healing. So that's 3d4 plus six. 12. (sings a note) You gotta roll it angry. Two slam attacks, right? Make a wish. (softly sings along with the background music) I'm just gonna go ahead and borrow this. Possibly permanently. Half damage? Wait, what? No damage! Whoa. Okay, okay. Yeah, man. I'm gonna actually, wait, can I Cutting Words that? I'm gonna insult him. I'm gonna call him a (clears throat) "Oi, you fobbing elf-skinned flapdragon! "You paunchy ill-breeding lewdster! You unmuscled reeling ripe mumblenews!" Shakespeare insult generator. What? I thought the roof was only like 45 feet up, 50 feet up! I yelled it really loud. No problem. What happened? It's looking pretty rough. (All laugh.) Loot the body. Might get some acorns. Oh. Wow. What'd you get, Liam? You could cut me out first! Okay, just go, it's okay. Sic 'em. My God, better miss. You're still alive! Wow. That's impressive. Damn it. You wanna do-- Nah, I can't do that to you. I can't Dimension Door you. Oh. Is that your action, though? Don't do that, then. You need to, no, you need to attack-- Fuck that. I'm fine. Leave me, I'm fine, this is cozy. To throw you. I will heal Vex with my bonus action first, right, she's still within range, yes? (singing) I'm... I don't know. I'm giving you everything, all that health will bring, this is true. (singing) And all I want from you is a promise you will kiss me forever. (singing) I'm - I'm! - giving you everything, all that health I bring, yeah-- All right, so that's at level one. Eight. And then I will cast Bigby's Hand. Next to Keyleth, and cup her gently. And just sort of cup and fling. Yes. What is that for? 24. Hey, you've still got your attack. Just throw a fireball? Aren't you Johnny Storm? Run away. Heal yourself. Do you have any more potions? Is that like a venti? Whoa! That's the last time I listen to you. Someday Travis will attack again. It's been like eight weeks. You out again? Hey! He has to make a strength check? Saving. Because I had a Cutting Words a while back. So that's negated my Cutting Words as well. (to the tune of the Pink Panther theme) Dead-ent dead-ent-- SAM, TALIESIN, and Javelin of lightning. He burned two of them. He didn't use any sort of legendary thing, Matt? You got the kill? You didn't do anything! You fell five times! I instinctually throw Keyleth in the air. No, no, with the hand. Oh, thank god. Does my Song of Rest need to be during a short rest? Thanks for coming. Hey, guys, I'm still trapped in the vines! Certainly. No, don't hit me. I'll sing more Spice Girls. Thank you. Little bit. No, it's just a tree now, I think it's okay. Are you sure Vex'ahlia should get it? I think maybe I should get it, I fought bravely in the last fight. Do you want to shoot me? I'll be okay. I'll be okay, you shot me before. Right here. Guys. Life needs things to live. (All laugh.) And we are those things. I think we've all learned a lot today. (cracks up) Sweet. We could stop at that hut on the way out. We never found the theater. You know what we could do-- You know what we could do, Vex'ahlia, we could go about 200 feet away from the hut and you could just--fink!--and see what it does and then we'll shift out of there. All right. Oh! Wait, someone's here. Who is this? Artagan? What are you? I cast Otiluke's Resilient Sphere on him. I don't know. 19. 'Cause I didn't pull up the Cone. A companion? What does that mean? Does he come to life? The hut, the hut. She's not a hag? One question. Do you stay on this plane or do you come with us? All right. All right. What was your name again? You know, at some point you should ask yourself why we didn't just kill you and why we knew that you were there the whole time. Who? All right. All right, I'll release the sphere on one condition. I believe you have a quill that belongs to us. Just a single writing implement. We lent it to you, we want it back. All right, I'll let you go. Thank you. Vax. Was this yours? Okay. Let's go back to our plane. Say bye to the Fey. Gross. Ooh, there it is. What does it do, what does it do? What does that do? Oh, Prince of Thieves-style? I don't know. A Christmas tree? Wait, you got the dog? Sounds good to me.
