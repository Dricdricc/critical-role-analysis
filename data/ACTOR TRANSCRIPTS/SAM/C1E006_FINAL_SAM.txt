First of many. I'm wearing one right now in my underpants, which we will be selling next week. Are we doing free ads now for people? Let's do this! (Beatboxing) Doesn't matter. I was just so out of it last time. Have we rested? Are we in some need of rest? What are we around? What's near us? Is this just a tunnel? Is there any sort of shelter, caves? Oh shit. How was that for you? (all laugh) We're back in the camp. So I'm okay. That's all I need to know. Okay. Anyone need some healing? Are we all okay? Are we all good? As we survey the area, how many tunnels we looking at? What's our options here? So we never went up to the war camp and through it. Oh we did! Got it. So we should keep going? We should just keep going. Magma? Follow the magma. Did you see the visual aid? I mean there might be something to be gleaned from going back to the war camp. Is Clarence with us still? Pike, if you'd like me to hold your armor or do you want me to take it off for a little while? Let it hang out a little bit? Just saying, you might feel more comfortable with a loose fitting sort of cloak? I'm not creepy! I'm just trying to be mindful! I'll just have to use my imagination. Onward. Keyleth, you don't have any way of - say it gets hotter than this? You don't have any way of getting some water out here? Your intelligence is now 4. (all laugh) I think that's the water one that you just pulled out. It's like a piss stream! Ahh! That's good to know. That's really cool. 6 miles?! 19. How do you know that? That’s true. Wow. What? Trapdoor? I was with you the whole time. I was drunk. Well, it’s hot gnomes. It’s a fortress. And it’s not a temple? Yeah, I was there! Yeah yeah, good, thank you for that. Of the fortress. How we can get into the trapdoor, exactly. Smaller-- --of two...what? Percy. How long would it take you to make a nuclear weapon? (whispering) What does that do? Oh, cool! What's our angle here, gents? So there's an entrance to this trap door that possibly is on the outskirts of the city? LIAM & So we need to find it. Oh, it's on the left? Let's do it! Quietly. Oh, snap. I can't read the dice. It's either a 6 or a 9. No idea. Oh, that's the bottom? It's a 6! (all laugh) Ambush them? Why don't we create a distraction and get rid of them? How many are there? Are you gonna kill-- (whispering) Band? It's a win for Grog. You're working. You don't have time to eat. Next time, sushi. Sushi. No indication of what kind of a creature it was? The thing with the plate? Oh! We could use that to our advantage. I'm looking for doors and stuff as we go. I don't know why. Well, there's a trap door somewhere, right? Because it's a different color? I'm coming with. Oh boy. (laughs) Not my strong suit. I've got advantage, don't I? It was a 1. I don't know. (sings softly) What? What? I was singing? (whispering) I was singing? I didn't even know! It's a force of habit! You get advantage on investigation? I think it's suicide. (all laugh) It is. It's a human centipede. I'm really bad at stealthing, we should go. (all laugh) Was I doing that? It's force of habit, I don't - it's like breathing. Wait, we didn't make it into the - was there a structure that we could have entered? Okay. But I mean, where we just were? They didn't have doors in them? Okay, good. I'm looking for a door! Okay. Okay. Let's go. Pike, I have this weird feeling, like you wanted to make out with me. Is that something that happened? Am I dreaming? Really? All right. I deserved it, I deserved it. 19. Yes. I kiss Percy! (all laugh) I don’t know! I thought it might help. Is that bubblegum? Could be good, could be bad. We have no idea. I can hold him. Might piss him off. Want me to go check it out? Yes, I can go invisible. I polymorph and turn into a fly and I buzz over. It's all right. I've got magic, too. Like a Medusa type of a thing? I buzz back to the group. (buzzing) I kind of fuck with Tiberius's ear a little bit. (all laugh) And I turn back. (all laugh) A crazy statue of a crazy illithid. We're going on? Dave. Should we move this statue off to a safe place, inside or anything? It's fine here, it's fine. Okay. (laughs) Metaphorically... We need to 007-- We're going to have to 007 sniper them out. I think you're right. No no no, can you redirect the magma flow around that bulge with your - can't you, move rocks or-- So you can create a like a little lip for it to go around? First we’ve got to take care of the guys on the roof. Are they back with us, or are they still stealthing in front? Okay. We can - me and Pike - can take out the guys on the roof. Yeah, but they're a good 200 feet up. I can take Pike and we can do it. Mute, as in silence noise, or a person? No, not me. We gotta take out the fuckers on the roof. Do you want to try to shoot them out? Or do you want me to take Pike and fuck their shit up? That's what we're going to do. Here's my plan. I take Pike up there. We knock those fuckers off, super easy. Grog runs out and brains them the second they hit the ground. Maybe. I don't know where they're going to fall. What you got, Pike? I can get you up there. What can you do when we're up there? Yeah! I'm going to just look at the guard's pattern of movement. Are they staying in position, or are they walking around? Are they talking to each other at all? Oh shit. Are they close to each other? You said twenty feet? No no, one came to swap out the other. Okay, they're standing twenty feet apart? Radius? 15 feet? Is the range a radius? No, I mean a range of a spell, is how far from me? Got it. We're good. No. I can get there like that. We're good. All right. You ready? Do you know what you're going to do up there? I'm going to try to knock them both off in one blow, but if I miss, you gotta take one. Okay. Grog, you ready to kill? We’re little people! You know why? Because I need someone with me and I can only take her, because that's the only other one who will fit through the Dimension Door with me. Yes, we're going to go through a Dimension Door. I can take one person of my height or smaller. So I will take Pike. We're going to try to appear between the two of them. Exactly between the two of them. I cast Thunderwave and blast out from where I'm standing between them, 15 feet in either direction. So, 10 feet and 10 feet away from me. Uh, 19. I don't think it's loud. Oh no - well, it's a wave of thunderous force, but it doesn't say sound. It just says thunderous force. Okay, fine. Make out with me! (all laugh) Wait? It was really hot, right? Come on! Just a little something something? We have to kill these fuckers. He’s hurt. (high voice) I’m sorry! I do too. All the time. No, no! That is not true! Piss on the body! Is there a door or something? Of the fortress. Oh, it’s not a standalone tower. It’s part of a larger wall. No, I’ll do the same thing to get us down. Unless you want to stay and fight. Should we get out of here? Okay, we’re going to Dimension Door out. (laughs) Just the tip. How do we get in? Grog, just kill it! Oh shit. I rolled a 65. It's a Delorean. A lariat of truth? Ooh. That ain't gonna do it. That ain't no good. Mister Me? Okay. Boy, oh boy. We're still trying to get that fucker up on the roof right? I've got almost nothing. So I'll just - can I summon an Unseen Servant to push him? (all laugh) I don't have any ranged weapons. Just a normal athletics. Yeah, I mean it's a 5, so. (all laugh) Thank you, Jarvis! (all laugh) Damn it! And I'm going to just give a little inspiration to Vax. That's Laura, obviously. (all laugh) (hums Dueling Banjos) Kill this guy. He's lasted longer than most of the people we fight. I think they heard us. Guys, I'm sensing a lot of purple and brown construction paper here. (all laugh) It is. (all laugh) Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he’s never known the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon. Also, we've got these t-shirts. You should want them. (Laura and Marisha laugh) Where are we? We were just going in a door. 30?! Jesus. And his queen, Durarara. Ulara. Uhura. Ulara. I go where Pike goes. (humming a Muzak version of "The Girl from Ipanema") Watch out! LAURA It's that book. Do something! Yeah! Don't you need some Grog? The man one. I turn to Pike and say, “What the fuck is going on? Where are they?” I’m sure it is. I read non-fiction. I’m going, too. Roll the dice. We’re coming. 12. Little late, little late. Do they already knew [sic] we were here? Now they really know. Are any of them Lady Kima? Because if they're not, they're about to die. Put them in the bag of holding, Grog. There's voices coming from the stairs? But there's a bear in the stairs. Oh, snap! Hold? Snake attack! He's protecting the cells. Yes, yes. (nervously) 4. You gotta jump over people. Keep chewing. Encourage violence. You don't kill him in one shot, it's very very disappointing. Keyleth starts eating him. I think he's going to make it. Is that our girl? I'll go! Wait. Do we know it's her? Yeah, yeah, oh. I'm gonna take a peek at her. What do I do? What do I roll? I'm going to heal her with a little bit of a song. If I may. Okay. So, I step forward and I pull out my flute and I sing, (singing) "As long as I got my song and flute, “I'm gonna give some healing to you. “Love and magic in the air tonight, “gonna give you some hit points. “Gonna give you some hit points, “gonna give you some hit points of our love.” (all laugh) It was a slow jam. Say yes to life, Pike. I notice a bulge in Grog's pants. (all laugh) Vault or the armory? Those are places that we can go? Do you know where the vault is? Lead the way! Let's go, but should we unlock all the other dwarves? We're following up the stairs. Kima. Not good. Not good! Lady Kima, if I may. If you're intending us to choose between you, and our ally Clarota, and we can't get you to see eye to eye with us, then I'm afraid you leave us no choice but to choose our own friend Clarota over you. We're giving you one last chance. Either you are with us, or you are against us. This is a threat. We mean you no ill will. It is you who are aggravating the situation. Well, I rolled a 3... But I have a plus 13! So that's a 16. No, he was with me, he was with me. Of course she is! Everyone is! (all laugh) So friends then? Has mind-sucking tentacles. And I start humming 'Kumbaya'. (all laughing) SAM (singing softly) Kumbaya, my lord. Kumbaya. No, no, no. That's fine, that's fine. You just want her because she's badass and you could hump her.
