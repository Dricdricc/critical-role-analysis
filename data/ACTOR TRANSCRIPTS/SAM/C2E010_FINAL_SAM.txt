Don't mind me! (laughter) This week, guys, D&D Beyond is offering up another discount code for 24-- no, I read that wrong! 25% off any single purchase in the D&D Beyond marketplace. Use code "InvisibleWand," not case-sensitive, at check-out to receive the discount. I've done a lot of things to promote D&D Beyond and all of our sponsors. I've done poetry. I've done opera. I've sung songs. But there's one art form that I haven't explored... and that's dance. So tonight I will be performing, with my invisible wand, a ballet that I wrote to honor D&D Beyond. I may need a camera person. (laughter) (singing, VO) D&D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D&D Beyond, D&D Beyond, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D&D Beyond, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D&D Beyond, D&D Beyond! (cheering) Some things just have to be expressed with the human body. I would do this at home. Sure. Let's really push the envelope of dick jokes. Oh! I need one. I need a large. Should I get one in the store? Are they available? Should you be talking about him out in the open like that? He's a new god? Give us a hint. That is cool! But do you talk to him? You were in Alfield. It seems like it's harder to get over to the Pillow Trove, maybe you could have them forward your mail to here or something like that. Or if we had some sort of a P.O. box. We need to get you some nicer clothes, then. We've been sitting drinking, right? We've been plotting our next moves. This is your jam? What time is it? Actually, what season is it? Are we north? Is it going to get cold? Can you pick me up earmuffs? That sounds amazing. I will do that. Are all the sewer grates blocked with a lock? To this one? Count again. Before I go, can I borrow that ring of water walking? Not that one, that one, or that one. I know what those are. Yeah. That's it. (laughter) All right, I'll go down there with Yasha. MATT. You climb down and join Yasha there. You can see the slight decline behind you as it progresses away from the direction of where this current seems to have happened. Once again, the smell is stagnant, a combination of waste product and whatever else has rotted and congealed down there. That smell of bacteria-filled liquid and water. Continuing upward, it curves a little bit to the right and out of sight with a faint bit of torchlight that bounces off the slick wall. There is a weird humid warmness to the air down here. It's not extremely pleasant. You don't see anything else in here other than what look to be clusters of waste combined with sticks and whatever else has washed down here through previous storms and has begun to build up blockages here and there, maybe a foot, two feet across. It's fine! Just come down. It's a trap, we're all going to die. Monsters are down. I'm going to get down and take a little bit of the smear and-- Do I taste anything? 19. Plus five! No, plus three. It's old diarrhea. Familiar? This is bloody stool. (groaning) I know this taste. I know it well. It's sort of like Pringles, where you just can't have one. So something's been killed and dragged that way. I'm going to look for footprints. That's a one. I'll be right behind them. Middle-rear. As I see everybody doing this, I'm going to take a big swig of liquor. Yep, yep. It's definitely because of that. Look at this sewer! Is that real wet? 20. There's a couple rats within range of my allies, right? So that I could get sneak attack? Okay, I'll disengage, back away down that hall that way, get far enough away, then turn around back, go (whimper), and fire my crossbow at the one next to Jester. No, that's Molly. 15 plus four, I think? Okay. That's a lot of d6s. Right? Yeah. Okay, so. 15. It's a small hole the bolt makes. That's it. Tomato juice bath. (laughter) Where's our order? All right. Nott will go forward next to Caleb and peer around, and fire another crossbow. I know! I haven't been in any gas, I don't know what's going on. All I can see is you guys going (yelling) like weirdos. So I'll fire. 18. There's sneak attack damage too, right? That's a lot. In the teens. I guess I will-- If there's a way to pin the rat to the wall, I'll do that. I would never hit you! I care for you, Caleb. I am extremely scared right now, but I think that we killed the monster and we can go back to surface now, right? That was clearly something down here that's been killing people. Spiders don't like rats, do they? Did you see the one that kind of looked like a dog, though? That was freaky. Are we going that way? We're going a different way. Stealth checks! Can you help someone there, Jester? Not me, I don't need it. Ten. Not so good. Or a body. You think its dead? Should we go try to cut it down? Without alerting them. Wait! Should we get ready for some sort of distraction or to do something to the other web first? No, no, I just-- Steal from the dead bodies? I agree. Yeah. I like that idea. But then we'll get to see it, and get the drop on it. Yeah. What if they're still alive? Oh, yeah, that's good. Or maybe they just were wrapped up five minutes ago, and they're totally fine. She wonders if the giant spider heard it. Should we get into some sort of position so we're not all clumped together? I'll go behind Caleb. There's things behind us, too? I'm going to go 15 feet behind us. That's a one. It's not behind us! Nothing back here! Wait, no! But that's a person! All clear in the back! No need! It snuck up on us? Five! Because we save it for when it really counts! I'm probably screaming. (screaming) You have a one with the stand. He's busy. That's all of the poison damage. We are all going to die because of the Golden Snitch. Okay. I'm going to shout out I think this is the monster! I will nervously fire my hand crossbow at the beast, hoping not to hit any of my friends. 12 plus something? Six. 18. Yeah. (counting) 14. Plus Fury of the Small, 17 points. (cheering) Yeah. I scramble away in Caleb's direction, and that cocoon guy there. I'm going to hide right behind him. Okay. A 15. Healing Word? No, it's not! Do your thing. What happened to the healing coming? Wow. We killed it! Is someone going to heal Fjord? Okay. Oh boy. I'll stay put, and hold my attack until I can see the whites of its pincers. As a bonus action, I'll cast Mage Hand and start digging around some rocks, see if there's anything over there. Not anymore. Yeah. I don't know. You can use the bonus action granted by your cunning action to control the hand. Got it. Then nevermind. I'm holding my attack. Wow! From where I'm hidden to where it was when it appeared, how far is that? So I have to roll with disadvantage? Ooh, not as good. 11. Throw your throwing stars! It's impossible. He can say anything with that voice and it would sound awful. (Infernal voice) Can I have a fishing rod? (laughter) I'll come with you then. You're safe now! Whispers. Far Cry 5? I've heard about it. I'm going to say in Halfling to the man it's okay, just calm down. Everything's going to be fine. I start cutting him out. I'm going to cut him out. Do you have the stuff? Or did you-- Yes, but she was a horrible person. Ooh. I'm going to get closer to Thed and say in Thieves' Cant-- You can trust us. We're one of you. Natural 20. (cheering) They're cool. We've heard that before! I could try. Watch out for poo rats! Yeah. (clicks tongue) I can look around. Thieves' Cant is a written or spoken thing? 19. 19. (whispers) Money pot? (louder) It says, "Money pot!" That's one of our one-shots! That's one of our things, but that's not-- it can't-- it's not us. We weren't down here before, were we? Maybe. Maybe this is the name-- maybe they've named all the entrances and exits or something like that. Should we try to jimmy this lock and get out? Okay. Well, do we need to get the spider first? I'm taking at least one button off of every single person in the-- Yeah. We've got to go up. I don't know, guys. All right, I'll try. (shouting) Hello? We're stuck down here, and we want to come up. Let us out of the sewers. Let us up! Oh, yeah. What is that, sleight of hand? Dex bonus is four, proficiency is three, plus 12 is-- Oh, it's just two? Okay. 18. We can move it up first. Wait, to get the spider inside the hotel, we'll need a clever disguise for it. A hat, a beard, perhaps. I could do a spell and make myself look like someone else. Mask and earmuffs should make me look just perfect. I like it. Good idea. Don't tell them about the bag. Ooh. The card that says "give to Travis." Why did all those people want to rebel against her? She seems nice, though. There's not a lot of shades of gray in your world, are there? It's just shit, or not shit. Are we each taking 100 gold? We did it, and we never have to do another adventure again. Right? Towards something? What? What?! All right. Sounds good. When Fjord's taking a bath, I'm going to go through his stuff and try to find his letter. The letter for the Solstryce Academy. Not good. 15. I got to stealth past Molly, or get him out of the room. Ooh. (yells) There's no liquor in here, oh boy, I better go down to the bar. Nothing. Liquor. (gasps) I'll give you a whole gold piece. Two gold pieces! Let me look-- (laughter) What is this? Ah, fuck you! (laughter) All right. You're right, he's not very grumpy. He should be. If I barfed up salt water every morning I would be grumpy. You know what, I think he is grumpy, but he stands next to Beau so much that he looks happy. (laughter) I'm sorry! Ulog? The dwarf, from the Knights of Requital. He paid for that service? Wow. Did we get another job offer? What do they want you to do? Come on, what's the fidelio? Is this room that you rented gigantic? What? What? Oh, okay. This place sucks. Should we just do this, then? Do you want to stay, Yasha? I'll stay with you if you want. Yes, we leave. Take it away, Matt. "My name is Clive Bens." (laughter) That was the roughest of old biker bars. All right, guys. Thank you so much always a pleasure. Pick this up next week, wish it was sooner! You guys, thank you so much, have a wonderful night, we'll see you on the internet. Until then-- Anyway, good night, guys! I'll be performing in a college a cappella concert on Saturday night. Charlottesville. I don't know the address.
