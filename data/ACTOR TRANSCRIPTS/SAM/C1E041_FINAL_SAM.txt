I got to go get ice! Phone's ringing, sorry. You know what, I'll send it to voicemail. Oh, didn't we have a tunnel made that goes under the wall? To the city. By the way, hi guys. What about the thieves' guild tunnels? Would anyone go there? That bar. Place. With the thing. This is the seat of power, right? But then he could just come and kill us! Okay? How fast is he? Going to let you go on your own? Yeah, yeah! Yeah! How do we do that? We could leave a trail of gold that leads to it, Goldilocks-style. If we go back into the city to try to find council members, and we succeed, what does that get us? A bunch of people who also don't know how to defeat the dragon. Politically? Listen, Jarett is good, but I don't want to sacrifice him like that! What about Trinket? Oh, that's right! (stuttering) I am not going to go-- They have mind control powers! They have influence! They have charisma! Beyond even mine! I'm the size of his toenails! Something tells me I would end up his gimp. All right, that's the best plan ever. All right, I'll do it, I'll go and-- That person will surely die. (laughter) Hang on, we're going to go now, without resting? That's not a real place, Travis, it doesn't exist. Grog, who are you talking to? Should we go to sleep? If only I had taken a dump in the middle of town, I could see what's going on right now. (laughter) Other number. (laughter) That could mean he's far away or that he's dead. Good to know. Or he's dead. Take everything. It's true. Where is it? We're just going to march into the city? The tunnel just goes to the other side of the wall. Grog, good thinking. (laughs) Nice. What is going on? Ah, he's so honorable! Oh no. We should leave him. Honey badger doesn't care. Wait, wait, wait, can a red panda climb a rope ladder any better than-- Yeah, we're right here. Where's Gilmore's again? That's up here. Wow, we have to cross the entire city. But we could go along the wall. All the way along the outside wall. Take the beltway? We add ten? 25. Wait, you see someone? Where is he going? Garthok? We are Vox Machina. I am the de facto leader. My name is Scanlan Shorthalt. Garthok, are you familiar with tunnels or secret passageways around the city at all? Are we near any? We're near the Temple District now. But if the entrance to the tunnel was destroyed, it's best not to risk it. Let's keep going. Are you okay with stealth? We're not near the entrance to the tunnel right now. They may win. They work for a dragon. But they're innocent. I believe him. Which one is Jason Charles Miller? Should we be at all concerned about drawing attention to ourselves? No, I mean, like, giant Fireballs or anything? Natural 27. 12. Pike fell down in some rubble. Oh, what? Who, me? But I'm-- Oh. That hits. Damn it. Someone give him a laser pointer. Okay, so the guy next to Percy is the dwarf? Okay. I will hand-cone it up and I will cast Dominate Person on him. And I will try to bend him to my will. Okay, good. Okay. I will tell him to walk over to me and start emptying his pockets of anything he's looted. Straight-up. (laughter) No, I'll stay there to accept my treasure. (laughter) Go Trinket. Don't hit Pike, don't hit Pike. She's right in the middle! What is War God's Blessing? Thank you. You're doing a good service. Dragons can see bolts of lightning. All right, all right, that makes sense. What are you going to do, what are you going to do? What if you miss? Those are stinky dice. This guy's going to be a puddle-- Wait, does he get two more? What? Oh, there's more people? All right. I guess I'll try to intimidate him to stop, and I'll say, I'll turn to him and say, you there! Idiot! (stutters) You're not going to win! You should not fight anymore! Because you're going to die. And that's it, that's all I got. 22. You know what, I'll sing to him to intimidate him, would that help? Sure. I will sing, (singing) Some people call me a gnome cowboy. Some people call me the gangster of love. (singing) Some people call me Maurice because I'm a hitter, I'm a winner, I'm a bedroom shitter. (laughter) And as my bonus action, I tell the dwarf to start collecting all the stuff from all the other people as well. Gilmore? Use your dragon perception, lady. Oh, you knocking him out? Can I specifically look for the beaded curtain he emerges from? And a barrel of lube. They gave it to the dragon. Him. Whatever that is. No. Oi, dwarf. Who have you been collecting swag for? Okay. (laughter) He told you this? The gates to it are open? And the dragon sits there in the open, collecting his bounty? No, that's fine. Tie him up. Sherri, it's us! Wait, what, who? He's a friend, he fought with us. He's not corrupted by the dragon's influence. It's really cool. His body? Yes. Very. Is there any point to searching for more Council members or allies before we go? When you saw him, did you see anything important? Yeah, did it look like scarring? From a previous fight? Gilmore, before we go, one more crazy question you're not a dragon, are you? All right. Should we teleport, or is there tunnels, or how do we go? Oh, with Garthok? Or with Gilmore? You're going to go up there? Because he told them to. Last time we took a dragon's gold, five of them showed up. Don't you think the dragon knows everything that's going on right now? I'm the spy here. It was every time. I'm coming too. Who's three? Us three? Then we're all going to the same place. Can't you tree-shoot us, tree-shoot them there? Which castle? The keep? 28. Garthok's Dilemma is a great book. (laughter) Can you tell us where the entrance is? Do we know where the entrance is? Pike! You can come with us. You can come with us. Enough treasure to go around. All of us? 27. This is it. Traps? Vex, can you scan for dragons, please? He got it already. Talking about dragons? The dragons came and got it. Can we see, can I see any signs of dragon claws or dragon slobber or anything? So people put a bunch of gold there then someone else came and took it? It's your fucking people from the Clasp, isn't it? Let's follow the tracks. They're fresh. Well, we've come this far. I'm very easily swayed. (laughter) You're right, you're right. But if Vex could somehow convince us-- (laughter) And they're like 100 yards away. I just shrug. I think he was talking to you. (laughter) It's been a great day killing with you. I hope our paths cross again, perhaps in the catacombs. Tell them whenever they see Scanlan Shorthalt to open the door. They stealthed, so I don't know where they went, do I? Got a nine on perception. Can I look at the tracks? I can't read tracks. Three. Do I even know how to get home from here? Will you tell me how to get back? Will you tell me how to get back? (laughter) Garthok. Garthok told me he was going back to his Clasp entrance. Our paths will cross again. He also said that you were kind of weird. Yeah! Are we there now?
