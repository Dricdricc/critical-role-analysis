Wait, what? No, it's not. We're not an official thing, though. We're just a mom and pop thing; we don't really exist. Our poster is in the book? Good job, Travis! That's coming up next Monday. I think it's going to be a spooky-ooky episode. I think so. Creature master. I'm first? Oh god, are we doing accents? We're doing accents? All British? Hello. My name is Claire Sittish. I'm a Briffinbore? I'm a Dryffingor... student? Am I a student? I don't even know. There's no bio! You did? Oh boy, I don't know, I didn't read it. My name's Claire Sittish. I come from a well to-do family and I'm quite admired all around the school. The underclassmen, the upperclassmen, the 5th years, the 9th years, the 12th years, they all love me. I haven't read Harry Potter. But I'm supes popular and if you ask me to go to prom, I'll say no. I'm also a super awesome wizard and cross me and I will fuck your shit up. Sure. And I've got red hair. I'm styling and that's it. I shouldn't be here. What's that smell? Is it sweat? It's sweat. You should go take a shower. Why would you do-- did your mother pack it for you? Disgusting. Do you have a boyfriend? Weird. I don't think I should be here. There's been some sort of mistake. These are all fuckups and weirdos and I should not be part of this little selection of riffraff. If you'd like my mother can call-- what are you-- get out of my personal space. Well, I don't know about you all, but we have some essays to write, so I'm going to get right down to it. What? That's impossible. You haven't moved from your seat. Durbin. Has my mother called yet? Because I'm pretty sure she wants me to come home. I have to prepare my room for-- -- for a very important family gathering next weekend. And she would not be pleased to know that I am-- I don't sound anything like that. The Defense Against the Dark Farts classroom? Are there any lockers or cubbies or things around? If the teacher comes back and catches you doing that, she's going to give you detention again. I'm not going to tell her, but if she asks, I will have to answer truthfully. Oh, get the-- 16. From the office? Do you hear that? We were told to stay in this room, though, and that's what we should do. Yes, but it's not on fire. No, I'm not perfect. I just see no reason to break the rules, and I'm not going to until-- There's a screaming child in there. It's probably related to you because you're such a fucking baby over there. Ooh. Multi-language flip-off. You shouldn't get up at all. You got a map? It's a first encounter. Laura Bailey. Sure. Allison said she's going too, but she mumbled it. What's going on up there? TALIESIN and I can't be the only one down-- (huffs) I'm going to stay down here until-- Initiative?! Allison. I have a nine. Laura Bailey is about to operate combat. Multiple-- This was my first mistake, too. (exaggerated) Shillelagh! They have daggers?! I don't like this DM! (sarcastic English accent) Sacred Flame? What is happening up there? I'm going to stand up at the desk and say to those two sprites down there Those books are for students only! I will cast Magic Missile, sending two darts at one of them and one dart at the other. They instantly hit! They do. They cause two points of damage each. One takes four damage and the other takes two. Uh-huh. Then I'll move towards them, but turn to the right so I can hide behind the stairs or something. That's perfect. Nice job. You know. That's three dupes. He's a jock, though, he'll be fine. Isn't he the jock? You're not the jock? You're the rebel, you're the jock, you're the nerd. You're the burnout? What house am I? She is killing us. Because they were stealing the property of Schmogwarts. No! My beautiful face. No! Sure. Six. No, we were not told to. Mine is ten, yours is ten. Probably. We got like tons of healers. (screams) Oh, get off of my face! Oh, oh, oh! Begone! I don't know. I want acid to fly on you. I'll cast Acid Splash on this thing. It has to make a dexterity 14 save. So it takes three points of damage. Oh god! Can I just shake my hair at it to confuse it? Ugh! Help me! Why is no one helping me? My hair is just so luscious. I brush it 35 times every morning. Oh, boy. Travis' earring is so off-putting. I'm going to do what I did before, and do a Magic Missile. Get off me, ew! One bolt is going to hit the one in front of me, and two the one on the bookshelf. LAURA, LIAM, and Your dice are terrible, Liam. (laughter) Two points of damage to the one on my face. So two hit points to the one on my face, and four to the one over there. Are any of them dead? (screams) Help me! (as Nott) I softened it up for you. Why am I talking like Nott? Ah, I softened it up! No thanks. I'm not interested in you at all. Seen you walking around here and you're disgusting. There's a sprite down there. It's awful. Oh my god! What did you guys do up there? I was just down here minding my business, and you set these fucking things down here to mess me up? I blame you. Look at you! No! You're riff raff. No, I don't love you. I don't want a kiss. I have plenty of other options, thank you very much. How did they come out? You went where you weren't supposed to, and you messed with something you weren't supposed to, and I got fucking scratches all over my beautiful face. I think you've learned a lesson don't mess where you're not supposed to! They look like they're moving. Yep. (all repeat "McLoglilagh") I will use prestidigitation to clean up some of the gore on me. And fix up my face a little bit. And also I'll clean up some of the nasty bits, because I don't want the teacher to see. What? Fine. Meals Ready to Eat. I've not been following you. I just sit next to him in a lot of my classes, because I'm very smart and he's very smart. And I see him popping these things all the time. It's really gross. It's like astronaut food. They're like little freeze-dried pieces of shit, and he just eats them all the time. It's why he stinks to high heaven. It's disgusting. I know it's efficient or whatever, but it's not right, and I don't like it. I do not cheat. I'm making sure that you don't cheat. I have had the finest tutoring and the finest education afforded to me! I've never seen you in a class with me. I don't. When I finish here, I will get a job at the finest ... wizard ... bank. (laughter) Witch bank there is, and I will be just fine. You, on the other hand, will be rotting in some witch gutter somewhere. Get off of me! I don't want to stay in this classroom any longer. Is that how I don't ever see you in class? 21. Oh, the old Sam Riegel roll. Where's the whispers? To the left? To the right. And then to the left is towards-- Well there were sprites that attacked us in the room. Is that what you're referring to? We could tell you, yes. I'm not feeling so good. Not so good. Seeing as how the sprite attack was all of your fault, I think that you all should be responsible for making me whole again. Yes, I am the one percent, and I got there by hard work. Yes, well, I inherited some of their hard work. I have never felt worse. No, what-- Fine! I will tell people that we're best friends for one month, but no one will believe that. They know you. They know how weird you are and how attractive I am. Wait, no. I said I would tell people! Fine. I will be convincing. Please, Bryan, please. Thank you, Bryan. See? Now that is a classy young man who's been taught well. Not interested. I have plenty of boyfriends, thank you. Is that a thing from Schmarry Schmotter? Is it dark in there? Would you like me to make some light? Can I do that? I've been doing that since I was 15. Last year. (laughter) No, don't do that. Oh, you belong to the school. She's wearing clothes? Well, we are students of "Schmoschwarts." We pay the tuition that affords your fineries. In a sense, you work for us. So we would request kindly that you would tell us what's going on down there. I don't know. Yes, something is afoot here. We should write a strongly worded letter to the proctors at this fine academy. And we should get a partial refund on our tuition and possibly accommodations. All right, I'll go too. We get on! 18. Are we still Pass Without A Trace on? 19. Before we walk in, I'm going to quickly thank Bryan for helping earlier, and designate you as my Ward. Absolutely nothing. What was that? What were you doing? That was close. Why have you taken us here? Oh like, to cook? She's going to the kitchens now. 24. Get away. I see something. I found it. I'll go first. I know, that's why I'm going first. So I can spare you from pissing in your pants. This is not flirty banter. Ward. Let's go. All right, I'll go through the doorway. Claire, that's the armor. Where did you gather it from? Oh. Like a big spider? Oh no. Oh. Excellent work. Smart guy? You're just going to jump down into that? I'll go carefully as well. Oh snap. Close to the screen. What? Where are you going? Art & Arcana. It's so hefty because it's filled with luscious-- Lucious artwork on full color pages. Wow. LIAM, TALIESIN, and A Schmord of the Schmings. I mean, there's no other player, right? Oh no. Hello? What's that? Seeing that happen, Claire is also going to cast Mage Armor on herself. Probably not. There's no one playing here. (whispering) Oh no! You're the pawn. Oh no. Oh no, we have to play chess? I'm the queen! I am not at all concerned. Oh boy. Take the pawn. Take care of it. Don't worry, you'll definitely live because pawns always do. What if we lose at this? Can we move our other pieces that aren't us? Oi, you there in front of me, pawn, why don't you move ahead one space? Oh god, what is this? We're playing chess and we're fighting spiders? This is the worst! Is that dice jail over there? 13. Oh god, we're playing chess. This could take an hour! Yeah it can. On the first move, it can move two squares. Do the one space then? Quite the chess move. You're not just focusing on the spider, are you? Is it total damage? Total. Right? No? Each? Wow! Oh no, he's still alive? This is the most complicated fight I've ever seen. I'm up? To move as a chess person or to attack as a person person? All right. I will-- Okay. Wait, am I trying to fight the chess pieces or the spiders? Sure, but we also want to win in chess. Okay. I think I'm going to pick up my wand. I'm feeling a little cold today, so I'm feeling like there should be a bit of a snowstorm, and I will cast Snilloc's Snowball Swarm. Centered here so everything around like this, this, and this. 3d6 cold damage on a failed save of 14. So they each take 12 points of damage. As the snowballs hit, the spider takes six points of damage. Uh-huh. Are they alive? Should we move in our chess match as well? Sure. Oh, you've also got-- our other rook could make a shot at the spider. Will it attack, or will it just stop? Yeah! How're you doing, ward? King me! A what? It's our turn to move a chess piece as well. Also, we already moved a chess piece this match. I mean this round. Oh, into attack mode. Which is? Wow, Bryan. That's my ward. Oh no. But Allison's a badger. All of these jokes would make much more sense to me if I knew what you guys were talking about. Look at all of those Halloween decorations. (laughter) Oh, you can move a chess piece and a-- Oh, we moved. Does he have to fight? Oh, so chess moves just work. That's a genuine chess move, so it automatically works. The knight had already been hit by snowballs. You're doing great, Laurs. Bunder, no! I mean, it doesn't matter, whatever. I don't know how wizard's chess works. Aw, yeah. Andy, do some jock shit. Claire? Oh god. I will attack. Andy, you go first. Give me time to think. Claire will use Acid Splash on that spider that's menacing our badger friend, Ally. It's 60 feet. 14 dex save. Oh, which does that take, no damage? No, it just saves. There's nothing. Aw, poo. Am I allowed to? Is it our move in chess? Well, I can't move, but I can move one of the other players. I guess I could move one space out, but that seems like a waste. Which one? Let's move-- Let's move our bishop, Dildo Baggins over there, out one space to get ready for some business. It's business time. Yeah, they are almost the exact same design. Oh schnikes. The pawn is going down. (intone "Bad to the Bone") Oh no! You must have some sort of healing-- Yeah, badger attack! Do you need to get to Travis? I mean, what's his face. Blunder. Why don't you-- Oh. Also, you can only move-- Oh wait, no! He's a horsey! Okay, you can start getting over there. The casting time is ten minutes? Oh, jesus. Jesus, these spiders! Not really having anything else to do, I'm going to send Magic Missile-- no, that'll use my last 1st-level spell slot. I'll use Acid Splash to attack that same spider. Sure. Is this it? I'll do Magic Missile. I'll do Magic Missile against the spider that's menacing our Allison friend. All three darts. Oh, that's good! 12 points of damage. Yeah? Wait, what happens if I do it at 2nd-level? Oh, that's an extra four points. I'll do it at 2nd-level! That's 16 points of damage! Oh, wait, do we move? Chess-wise? Is it our turn? I'm going to move Bryan up to right there. Doink! It's the word. We haven't moved yet this round. The spider! You smoke? Of all the scientists, that would not be the one I would pick out to listen to. And the spiders too? I'll move up and around towards this spider. Is this the last spider? I'll move up towards the spider. Yeah, the big one. Oh, that one gets an attack of opportunity, though. Fails! I will cast-- oh shit, I'll hit something else, won't I? Oh well. I'll cast Dragon's Breath. With lightning damage, we'll say. A 15-foot cone. They have to save with a dex 14. Oh no, but I think I still get half damage. Ooh, good roll. 15 points, so halved, seven points of damage to both spiders and probably the spiritual weapon and probably one of our pawns. Seven points to the spider who saved. What about the other spider? Yeah, 14. Okay, so that's 15 points of damage to that spider. Yeah! I'm breathing lightning on you! Wow. Greased lightning! Is it looking pretty rough? (squealing) (screams) (screams) I don't like this. I don't-- Spiders are beneath me. Everything I learned aout my character I learned by looking at the poster. I think she's uppity. I don't know anything about-- (gasp) With my bonus action, I get a little moist. Oh, those aren't real glasses, are they? I still have whatever my spell was-- Dragon's Breath up! It lasts! I'm going to (belches) again right on the thing. Lightning comes out of my mouth. So it has to make a dex 14 save. Oh well. Ugh. Three points of damage. I want to angle the blast so that when the spider explodes and splatters, it splatters towards our little Ally over here and gets all chunky in her hair. Oh wait. There's spiders behind me. Oh, nice! Man! The Sorting Mat got it right with you. I don't know! I'm trying to talk-- Ah! No! My fine clothes! Oh no, I have-- I'm okay. What are we doing? What are we doing? I'm sorry that I splattered spider guts all over you. That was wrong of me. We're not so different, you and me. Nine plus five? It's tons. Yeah. You don't have to Command me. I'll grovel anyway. I know I was a bitch to you guys before and it's only because I really just, deep down, want to fit in. Also, side note I'm a virgin. I read that on Wikipedia during the break. Thought I should admit that to you now. What about you, jock? And you, honey badger? You know? I told you we weren't so different. A what?! I will literally come flying up the stairs. I cast Fly. I grab a broom! I have a feature where if he's in danger, because he's my ward, I can switch places with him. Yeah. I think he has to be close to me, but I don't really know where we're placed. I will switch places with him-- Which will put him in the air? Sure. Mm-hmm. 22. To write an essay? "Soh-crifice?!" An "oth-lete?!" It had spiders. It had chess. This makes me want to go read Schmarry Schmopper. How long did it take you to prep? Days? Hours? Minutes? Uh-huh. If you're in England, we'll see you tomorrow or the next day? "Oth-letes."
