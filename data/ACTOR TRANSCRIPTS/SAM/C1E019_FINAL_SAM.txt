That's normally how people greet me. And it doesn't look like some self-published thing, that looks like a real-- whoa! Does it have a barcode on it? Bed crap? (laughter) That happens all the time. PJ Uno! Well, I gave him a nickname to the nickname. A sub-nick! (laughter) No, I rubbed peanut butter all over my chest. (laughs) Oh wow, I do smell it now. Yeah, that's nice. Â Let's try reasoning with them. Whoa! That's not bad There's a lot of gasping going on. Wait, does Travis not-- He rolled a natural 20. 15. Hey, then we're all above 13, it's pretty good! This bodes well. (Grog voice) Would like-- It might work. (laughter) She just disappeared! Well, don't say that. (laughter) Whoa! Oh yeah. Okay. Hey, question. If I hold a turn, do I hold the whole turn? Can I hold my action but do the bonus action? How does it work? Okay, then I am going to just move. I am going to act. I am going to do things. So I turn to the guy who just hit me, and I am going to cast Dominate Person on him. I will sing some sort of song to dominate him with. (gasps) Really?! They're not humanoid? I would know that. Well, then, I guess I won't do that. Okay. (laughter) Yeah. Okay, well, then we just die. (laughter) Yeah, no, I have options. I'll be fine. Should I go for the guy who-- I'll do (blows raspberry). I'll cast Lightning Bolt on him. That's always a good go-to. Is it six or eight? Thank you! Okay. Six, six, four. What is that? Oh, really? Oh, that's awesome! Now I lost track. 32. I would like to inspire our new fellow, Zahra, with a quick little ditty. (singing) Ooh, you so scary, ooh, you so scary, ooh, you so scary. You fighty long time. (laughter) And if I move away from him he'll hit me? Can I snuggle between his legs and maybe he'll forget I'm there? It might anger him? Or it might entice him. (laughter) Spell save DC. Top right. She's a mother figure. Oh, for the barf. Take us as in-- Grog, can you ask them, take us as in lead us or on their back? Oh, that is good information. Just like in Hunt for Red October? We'll Mass Suggest that they take a bath later. Short rest. Hey, DM. How many hit points do I have? Have they increased at all? I don't know. d8. 15. Plus two. Four. I got it already. I am ready to rock. He'll be dead by the time he gets here It's really cool. Did Lyra give me-- Wow, I feel so warm and cuddly. Okay. I'm sorry. I was just distracted because we're in a dire situation and I miss the love of my life, Pike. I'm sure you can't identify with that. Aldor? A little. Well, we have something in common then and thank you for your stone of warmth or whatever it was. I'll just call it a stone of warmth. 20. Jeff. (laughter) Drink! If you think we've been sent on some sort of suicide mission-- Well, I'm a master of words. Should we abandon all hope and just flee? Is that what you're suggesting as our leader? Or should we carry it through and prove everyone wrong? You know what? Retrace your steps. We go. Well actually, Grog-- could someone ask Ace and Gary if we're there or if we have further to travel? I hope he can hit a wall. Well, you're the leader, shouldn't you be-- Let's carry on then. Don't mess with the magic. Yes, but the healing potion might do something. Let's just keep going. You are a very kind soul. I will check it for traps! Five. Everyone. There are definitely no traps here. (laughs) She's a stickler. Trinket's here? (laughter) He does things! I've got a wide range. I like to keep people guessing. It's my thing. I wouldn't want that, either. Of all the bears I've known, he's top five. Top five. What else can we do to prepare? Oh boy, already? Dex. 17. Oh. Plus four. 21. My Scanlan-sense is tingling! Does that take up our whole path now? Did they laugh? Thanks for that update. How do we get around? What do we do? Oh. Okay. Let's, yes. (singing) From a distance, the world is... They like to eat giants. That would help. So we could go in with an offering. We could. We could just walk in there. I could be holding Lyra as my captive and say, I've brought you this captive to eat. Well, you know, you're very appealing. What's it called? What's the title? Aw. That's cool. Did you consider the title Day Dreaming? I just thought, because it's like a pun. Consider it. We might. Depends what he asks. Yeah, let's do it. We don't have time to do any of this stuff. No! We walk in. He's beckoning us. Let's walk in. I'm walking in. I'm going ahead. I'll take the bag. Is that you? Hello. It's less than that. We're 30 feet away now. Rimefang? Yes. And I use Mage Hand to lift the diamond out of the bag and dangle it in front of the dragon. We've brought you this diamond. We've come from the Slayer's Take. We represent the guild and we are here to formally apologize for sending a few of our members here in the past and promise that we never shall again, and as a gift of apology and hopefully brotherhood, we offer you this diamond. There are many more to come. There is a diamond of much greater size and value in this pouch. But first, we want to hear that you are going to allow us safe passage out of here before we turn it over to you. Please allow us safe passage. And then you said roll for persuasion, and I rolled a 19. That was so cool. Your guardians are well aware of our power and position and did not want to offend you by turning us away. I'm called Burt Reynolds, and I take great offense at that. You can call me Mr. Reynolds or simply Burt. Oh, versus a dragon! What is it, persuasion? Seven. Low. Second to last. Natural 20, but it becomes 18. Oh, lots of red circles. Not the dragon. Although, probably the dragon too. Oh, you're running away from it? What's that do? What's that? My eyes begin to change to a dark shade as I turn my gaze to the dragon and cast Eyebite on him. Eyebite. I would like to sicken him. Give him a little tummy-ache. Through my Hand Cone of Clarity! It's 19. It can just choose to succeed?! What? But that was a cool spell! Okay, can I throw with a bonus action? A bag. Got it. Then I will move a few steps away. I can still move and stuff, right? I would like to move away from this group of soon-to-be-blasted-with-dragon-fire people. Just a few yards away to my left. That's fine, sure, that's great. And give some inspiration to Lyra. I'll say, (singing) When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's Aldor-e. (cheering) Well, I wrote it for you. Which one are you doing? But he's not fighting for us because of a spell right now. We convinced him. FELICIA and I appreciate the chat. Please, keep it coming. Plus three. Wait. She gets my inspiration on this throw. Grog, go get his axe! It's really big! How close am I? All right. Yes. Hi. Scanlan here. I'll do, (singing) It's Bigby's Hand! Bigby's Hand. Shamone. I'll just punch him in his dragon face. Oh, I have to roll for that? That's the spell attack bonus thing? Okay. 19. 4d8. I'm taking yours, and I hope that's okay. Ten, 13, 18, 21. Plus something? I'm 20 feet away. I will go 18 feet away from it and drop the grenade. Yeah, closer to it. Can I keep moving? No, I had to move closer to it. But if I leave, he's going to whack me. Wait, how close did I put the grenade to him? No, I wanted to put it two feet away from him. Hello, I'm a little gnome. That was crass. Hey! Percy. Wait, what did he do? Whoa, but can I sing real quick? Maybe it'll fling me away from the grenade. But it's not a concussion grenade. Is it a concussion grenade? It's already armed, isn't it? 20. I'm already low to the ground. All right! The grenade worked! (cheering) Wait, what did you just shoot at us? Nice. 11. No, he has one. He's got one more. If he chooses to use it. He might save it for later in the fight. No, he won't. I cast a spell on it as it retreats from me because I am a war caster. And I will cast Bigby's Hand to grapple that shit and pull him back down. (cheering) Don't you fly away from me, motherfucker! It's the grapple one to pull its wings together so it can't fly away? 18 plus eight. 26. You will leave when Burt Reynolds tells you to leave! (laughter) 2d6. That's another 18. Of course it does. And thus ends Scanlan. TRAVIS and That hits. I will be very soon. It's a dragon. Do I roll? Does he roll? 8d4? Can I roll 4d8s? 8d4. I'm at 19 now. I will stand. Taking a potion is an action or a bonus? I will Dimension Door way over there. And I'll take one of those four healing potions that someone gave us. Were they moderate? Okay, I definitely have one, so I'll take it. Trinket's protected. How high up? I will first use my bonus action on myself. Can I cast Healing Word on myself? Okay, d4 plus five. That's nothing. Actually, wait. Can I just take a potion as a bonus action? Okay, I'll just do that. I'll take a greater heal. 4d4 plus four. Anyway, I'll roll it later. Sorry. (counts quietly) Plus four is 11. Okay, I'm pretty much back up to-- I'm how far? But how far? (whispering) Sniper shot. (louder) From the shadows, I cast Lightning Bolt, which has a hundred-foot range. If the angle is nice and clean. It's my spell? What is it? 17? It was 8d6, but now it's 4d6, right? All right, what is that? (counts quietly) 26. 13. Oh god! Come on, Vex. Come on. Do it for Trinket. Oh! What is that? It sounds hellish. I run over to Lyra, cast Seeming on myself to give myself the appearance of Aldor, and I pour a potion into her mouth, and I wake her up. You did good, baby. Baby. I can't change height, so I release Seeming and I'm back to normal. Inspiration? Okay. I inspire them. I will sing something. I don't know what. I'm so out of it. We just killed a dragon! (laughter) 11. May I have that one, please? I'm sorry. By the way, your lips taste like bubblegum. 6d10? You'll see. You're going to get the paper. Yeah, sure, that'll work. The bear, too? What? Because if the answer is yes, we refuse. This is our leader from now on. I think this is a great idea. You're right. So do we collect our money? So it's 9,000 total? We'll make you an honorary member. We did it! I have to split.
