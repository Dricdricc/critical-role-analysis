Whoa! [cheering] Yeah, yeah. Yeah. D&D Beyond, guys. You know them, you love them, and to celebrate Critical Role live in New York, D&D Beyond has set up a discount code, just for a limited time. It'll get you 25% off digital books on the D&D Beyond marketplace, but you got to use this code, and I'm not making this up, it's SamIsOurHero. [laughter and cheering] This crowd is loving my song! I'll win a Tony Award after all! I'll do whatever it takes-- I think when Lin-Manuel wrote the song, he thought that it would be used in a D&D Beyond ad eventually. Ooh! [cheering] Oh, with the yogurt? Those are really good. Tell him they might have yogurt with them. What, your eyebrows just go like this? First roll. It's the ship! That's the ship that she owns! Yo ho! Ho? We have a rowboat. You want me to go get Caleb? Okay, okay! [laughter] I'll go get Caleb. Can you keep it going, but not be here? Because we have to go. We have to go. Will it sink quickly or slowly? Listen, we've got to make this decision on our own. He's entrusted me to come get you. We have to go on this boat with these pirates, or else we'll all be killed. Can you just temp it in, just like, rough it in? Just sort of close the wound as much as you can. There are real pirates. We're going to get on a boat with them and go to another, to see other pirates, but everything's okay. Everything's going to be fine, because Fjord has convinced them that he's the guy that we killed before, except with a massive throat laceration. All right, let's go. Oh yeah, you'll be fine down here. We'll send word soon. (clears throat) No. High rats. There were rats on the top of the mast and we took care of them. 16. Yeah. Aye aye. I think it's women and children first that are supposed to go, actually. Okay. You'll go first, Fjord? What'd she say? Oh, Janet. hashtag I'm A Pirate. I'm Gilligan. [laughter, cheering] I would say this, though. Just as a curious tourist, if you were to kill us you would not find the location of the item. We don't have a choice, so yes, yes. Do we pick our quarters first? Or do we get assigned roles? Or is there a uniform that we need to wear? Sorry, guys. We've never been on stage before. It's a learning curve. We'll figure it out. Always, yes, of course. Sorry. If she'll tell us? But why would she tell us? We are that. That's true. [laughter] (gobbling) It's a candle bar. Oh! It's very dangerous. Before we tell you anything about it, we want to make sure that you know how to handle it. A decent idea? We've seen it do things, scary things. We've seen someone melt while touching it. That's a 12. Oh, minus three. A nine. It's in your book! Fjord, maybe we should come clean and form an actual partnership with this person. If we keep lying to her, we're going to lose. We're whispering. Okay, she said dreams. She had a dream. You do, you have dreams! You have dreams! She beat you to the wet dream? (whispering) Uk'otoa. You know what the craziest part is? We don't really know why we did it. [cheering] It is. Yeah. Absolutely. The guards posted at our door, do they have guns or just like knives and stuff? Oh, both! Okay. Yeah, it was. Fjord, if I may. I'm sorry, Captain Tusktooth, if I may, when we find this Uk'otoa-- LAURA and You have this thing inside of you, is your goal to get rid of the thing inside of you, to commune with it, to bow down and serve this monster? I thought we were in our chamber. Wait! Before you talk out loud, can't you use your magic to make some sound or something to muffle what's happening in here? Okay, good. Go on. Yeah, that would, that's good. Yeah, it'll be like a white noise machine. Yasha can fall asleep. What the--? But our goal right now is not to run away, right? We're here for Fjord. No, but thing inside of you-- Caleb! We're friends, don't say it like that. Don't say we're friends, like a question. It's downward, we're friends. No. That was a question, it's a down. The point is we're here to support you in finding out what's going on inside. What's going on in your past, and if that means we have to go fight some shit, we're with you, and if it means you say, "Let's run," we'll run, but we got your back, big guy. As long as I don't have to swim. She might. How, how do we get to look at her belly? Should we go swimming, hope she wears a bikini and check for scars? That's not bad. Lift it up! Maybe lower, go lower. [cheering] Yeah, let's do it. Well she's coming with us, right? We can ask her on the way. Maybe, Yasha, you can intimidate her with your girth and darkness. Or, we can murder everyone on the boat! [laughter] Okay. Okay. All right. Mm-hmm. No, not you! I mean yes, if you turn evil and bond with Rikatoa. Is it night time now? Are we going to sleep? Okay. I'm going to sneak down into the cargo hold. [laughter] With my cloak on, so that's an advantage-y thing? Okay, stealth. 26. [cheering] I probably told you that I would be right back. I had to go to the little girls' room. Huh? Okay, I'll use a spell, then. I'll take a little bit of-- I think it's a cloth, fleece-- as Caleb taught me, and I'll create a Silent Image down the hall. Can I peek out the door a little bit? I'll make it look like Cosko is walking by the hall. Then walks back. Back again. Yeah. Well, we're in New York, I don't know if they have Costco. Sam's Club. I'll have Cosko moonwalk across the hall. Okay, I'll make my run away, my getaway. (trilling) Left. Oh. I don't want to do that. I'll turn around and go the other way. I'll have Cosko, is there a stairs or a ladder near here? Okay, oh, that's a four. Card table that's currently empty? Cosko's going to sit down at that card table and start dealing two hands. [laughter] Is there a way to slip by? Slip by the back, yeah. Okay, I'll make the effect disappear. Oh, but I'll leave the effect of the cards still there. [cheering] Poof! I'm going to look around for boxes and interesting stuff. Bullets, black powder, any books. Ah yeah, just going number two! It's going to be a while. That hardtack is hard coming out, too. Sure, keep going. Looking for interesting stuff. I will use Mage Hand, and he's just got the one lantern down there? I will use Mage Hand to try to snuff out the flame. I'll keep going, using darkvision to look around and see things. Oh, he's trying to light it again. All right, investigation, 22. Looking for interesting boxes. I don't want to spend more than five minutes down here, if possible. Sure. Maybe I can, can I grab it out of his hand? Or the lantern? Make him drop it? Yeah. Well, they shouldn't be using candles, then! Ugh. Are they in bags, pouches, boxes? Is it just loose? I'll take a keg. Yep. Okay, next box. Okay, shit. I'll use that Mage Hand again. This time, I'll unbuckle his belt. Okay, well can I get to one more box? Okay. Ooh, I have things. I have things! I have some shards of shiny pottery. I will throw them across the room. You said dexterity? 13. Yeah, I'll grab some of that, too. Okay, so I got an armful of gunpowder. Armful of rotting fruit. That's a success. [cheering] I'm going to head back, yeah. Oh boy, with advantage, I hope? Not needed. 29. That's right. [cheering] (quick footsteps) (panting) Oh, I got some old mango and papaya. These, I think they used to be oranges. I got this. This is a keg of black powder. It goes boom. It's like a bomb. Yeah. We can use it to blow shit up. We could. I found out that there's lots of black powder downstairs. If we wanted to make a getaway or something, we could go in, set it off, blow it up. Everyone would die, yeah! [laughter] Oh sorry, Caleb, yes. Of course. Okay. I just had the itch. Oh, good idea. I think we're taking a break. Are we back, are we on? Hey, before we go, can I just say, there was one special Critter here who got the farthest back seat in the entire theater, someone who is in balcony, row K, seat 32. If you look next to your seat, I left you a little present. That's you, way back in the back corner right there, you. Just look to the right of your seat, balcony row K, seat 32. Okay, good. It's the wrong person. It's that person up there. They'll never find it. It's going to be found in like six years from now. They finally found it. Bow bow bow! Code word. It's better when somebody's watching. (coughing) I thought you were going to say something else. Oh! [cheering] Zip? (whispering) Uk'otoa! Oh my god, Matt and Travis are going to make out. [cheering] Want a seven-day-old banana? Did you tell her the orb was inside of you? Yeah, when you asked what happened to him, what did she say? [laughter] She has a ship with cannons. Nine. [laughter] Nine eyes? That's a lot, yeah, that's a big power. Well, I know what I would do with it. Get rid of the seas. [laughter] Well, we'll find out tomorrow, I suppose. Was that a dick joke? [laughter] Let's do that, then. What? We've lost Ashley. No, it's gone. Should we leave the stage, do we need to leave the stage? (pigeon cooing) Wow, another dream with seamen scattered everywhere. [laughter] That's my people. Nobody likes to hear other people's dreams. It's really boring. Yeah, that's true. [laughter] Ooh! Yeah. You should write those down, they're really important. She just wants you to know that you're not normal. Should we go off to our adventure now? That's all you wanted to know, just-- Jester, we're probably going to kill all of these people. Maybe we don't care what they do. Before we go stealthing in, Fjord, do you want to look at the dodecahedron or anything? Would that be good? Yeah, you, you're the-- Like a pep talk. Not me. Oui. We love you guys!
