Including the Beatles. Where do you find those comics, guys? Okay, and what are they? And those viewers have to pay extra to get that, don't they? What? Oh my goodness! Well, I'm going to click on it right now. Okay. (laughter) We'll be dead in three hours. Better get them while you can. You can also get these by donating to the Obama campaign eight years ago. Just so you know. We're in the crypt? The sarcophagus sort of thing. Did you--? Did you go onstage? Did you say Briorities? All right, I'm going to charge in! (laughter) Greater? I'm going to use Minor Illusion to create a bull's eye right around his crotch. Concentric circles glowing. Yes, hello, hi. I look like your brother but I'm shorter. Yeah, for them. You can have one of my greater healing potions. Will that suffice? Oh, I look like a full-size Percy? Oh, cool. Speaking of looking like Percy and Cassandra. Vex. That is you, right? Vex, if you, if you look like Cassandra, you could conceivably get in front of the Briarwoods without them knowing that it's an enemy for a moment. Maybe long enough to fire off one of your-- don't you have some sort of sunbeam arrow or something? That would be pretty baller. I don't know. We could fight them in five minutes. Don't do anything! Which is? That would never happen. I'm more measured than all of you. I'm Percy. (laughter) Our meal is still active, as well. We need the benefits of that. Plus, there is a rebellion going on. It's been, what, an hour? Two hours? They're probably mostly dead by now. Just to point this out before we go in and kill ourselves. We have evidence now. We could abandon this whole thing. Go back and fight our day in court. Right, that was a stupid suggestion, Keyleth. We're all Seemed differently; it's very strange. Onward. I will be right behind the meat shield. I run over and I say, Pike, Pike, what happened, you disappeared before, but now you're back. Are you here to stay? What's going on? We're so happy to have you here. We're all healthy. And we have a new member. Well, a new traveling companion. This is Cassandra. With Pike with us, we can do anything. Can we hang a sheet over her or something? And Pike. Some gas? If we're going back out the way we came in? Well we'll just have Trinket run first. Grog, you suffer no poison damage. We had our meal. No Pike! The evil of this place is making it hard to maintain her connection. I got this. That don't look good. Should we send some light up there? I would just try to-- oh yeah. That's interesting. (laughter) Terrible. Why don't we just walk past it? No, let's get out of here. They wouldn't build a huge bronze trap room within their castle. No, they've lived here in peace for five years. What would they need this for? This has some sort of use for their magic. This is not a trap room. We've been beaten by doors before, but goddamn it, we're not going to be beaten today. I go to the center of the room and I find that little button thing and I'm going to press it. I'm in the middle. Yeah, can Trinket touch a stone? Or Cassandra. Cassandra, make yourself useful for Christ's sake. My friend back in Gnomolia, where I'm from. Wait. Hold on, as much as I love Pike, you aren't a real person right now. Maybe we should swap out Pike. Oh, it does work. Never mind, Pike. I love you. Grog, can you hit it? Wait, but are you going to hurt us? We're all going to get hit by what you're doing. What! You can do that? Yeah, do it. It's one on the wall, yeah? I step into the acid. And I start hitting the one in the center with my fucking stupid sword. Okay. Big arrow? What was that? 18 plus something, I don't know how to hit things. Is that a d20? No, it says 1d8 plus three. Okay, that's not much. 11. 11. I have a potion of acid resistance that I drank. Not the face! As my bonus action, I turn to Percy and I say, Percy, we're surrounded by metal and glass and stone above us. Is there anything we can do to that stone? Can't it burn? Can't you do things with stone, Keyleth? What does that do? What side is this? On the ceiling? Okay. Absolutely, is it my turn again? 17 to hit. Ten. One down. Acid melts whitestone? The whitestone on the ceiling? You're flying? I say to everybody, when Cassandra put her hand on the hidden gem outside the glass, it closed the doors, right? If I put my hands on that while you're putting your hands on the inside gems, it might open the doors, right? Yeah, but maybe if we do the other ones, it would still work? Is it worth a shot? I could. No. I can take Pike. Of my height. Oh, my size, not my height? I can take Pike. Wait, no. There's four of us in here, and four gems left. Or I could go outside the stone door and see if there's any more buttons out there to press. Pike, shall I take you with me? The best thing I've ever heard. You and me in a room alone together. I take Pike by the hands and I will Dimension Door out through the glass to where she put her hand on the hidden gem. Is that right? My leather pants are singed! (laughter) Pike, now's a good time to talk about us, don't you think? No, I'll just put my hand on the gem. Okay! Try to put your hands on the other non-destroyed gems! Do that more. Put your hands on the gems! Can they get two gems each? And my hand is on-- Come on, work, damn it. Could Trinket do the other one? Where's Trinket? No, I'm out! Pike, my love. Is there any way you can get to the other side of this stone wall to see what's over there? Break my gem? All I hear is, (muffled noises). I think Percy wants us to kiss, Pike. He said the power of love will inspire him? What did you say, Ashley? She said 16. Get over it! And does the stone door behind us open? Squeeze Gem. Me and Pike? A goliath? (laughs) We're smart. Three points? Mine's halved, right, so it's two? Should I get out of here and try to start working on the stone? Pike, is there any way you can get through this stone wall to the other side to see what's there? Oh no, we can't hear you. The darkness is consuming her. Who, me? Four. It's the evil. Oh, so we can swim through? I'm going to do that. I'm going to take a snorkel. Are there any buttons, knobs, levers? Did I see Vax push that? Okay, so I will push that. Guess I could have done that before. Sorry. I wanted to wait until they were gone. That's what it was. I was waiting until they were gone. I see stone, acid, a very handsome gnome-- oh wait, that's me. And a big button that I just pressed. Oh, hi. See you guys, you look green. None, no more buttons or levers out there? Nothing else? All right, do that. Wow. Is your bangy thing okay? Is it your sister? 27. One. Is this Egyptian pyramid-sized big? There's 200 stairs? Before we go stomping in there, should we take a short rest and heal up? Is anyone besides me and Pike damaged at all? We don't want to start traipsing up. They'll see us coming. Or we could wait until they get up there and then go. I'd gain a few hit points, but it's nothing bad. I can take a potion. Thanks, Sarah Palin. Not really. How far away are the four figures from us right now? Do you want to just hit them hard? 600. They're going to be inside, though, before we get halfway up. It's for grain storage. (laughter) No. Stop it. Me and Pike. We all look like Percy. The gnomes. We're slow. Maybe we should split the party further. Do we see them closing the doors? I inspire Pike real quick, just before the battle. I just look at her and I say, roses are red, violets are blue, we're both gnomes, and you are so foxy! (laughter) Stay out of sight, but get as close as we can. It's a French tickler. What's this? What's going on? Nobody. 17. I have the highest initiative?! There's smoke between them. All right, I hear talking? I come around the corner. The second I see her, Delilah, I will cast Lightning Bolt on her. I don't know anything. Actually, are they in a line? Is there a way I could get in a line? I wouldn't know anything about her, so yeah. I blast. I don't know. Was I? Would I know anything? Would I know that enough not to cast it? All right, then undo. I will undo, and I will instead-- I will try to blind her. Through my Hand Cone of Clarity. It would be 19. Oh, I'm sorry. Blindness. Oh, Jesus. I never use it, so I don't know. Blindness is a constitution saving throw. She makes it? So I wave at her. (laughter) Is that my movement? Can I get the pillar between us? And can I see anyone else? Okay. Then that's it. Slow him down. That's the first Briarwood damage. She can't see anything, so she's 80 feet away. Oh god. Just know Ashley, that sprinting in like this will take you right in front of the Briarwoods. Oh, feigning? Any bonus moves there, Pikey? Nice. Catch that, Pike? He healed himself. Hi. Oh no. The strength thing. Well, it can still kill you. Do it. This is it. This is everything, right here. And Grog? 6d6? It didn't work. As soon as she does that-- do I see this? I do not see it. It's a dead roll, a dead roll, it's between two. That's terrible. Four. Okay! She's strong. Yeah man, she's powerful. I will step out again, from behind. And I will try again. But this time I will say, hey, you paralyzed my friend, let's see if you like it! And I'll try to hold her. Hold Person. Yes. That's Vax near me, right there? I'm going to-- shit. Hide behind you? I will use my bonus action to inspire Percy, and I'll say, (sings) Percy's got a gun. Percy's got a gun. And then, yeah. Sure! I'll try to duck behind Vax for cover. He's hurting, but he's not dead. Do it! You're 15 feet from Sylas and 15 feet from Lady Briarwood. That's only on the attack. Pike helped. You got inspiration! (sing) Let the sunshine in. The sun shine in! I cast Counterspell as a reaction. 60 feet. Am I close enough? I say-- shit. Do I know what she's casting? Am I familiar with it? Do I know what level it is? Okay, so I'll say, (sings) Huh! That's the sound of the gnome, fucking with your spell! Yeah. And I'll cast it at level four. Fuck, so it's higher than that. What do I roll? I'm a charismatic guy. 23. Stay. Grog? I hold my turn. I'm sorry, I hold my action and my movement. And instead I will inspire Grog with a little harmonica ditty. (harmonica) Oh, is it his turn now, next? I hold. Can you put on the boots as a bonus action? It's too long. You're inspired! I will take my move now. And I will (singing) Bigby's Hand! (speaking) And I will raise up the hand somewhere between Sylas and Lady. (cheering) Mister is injured, right? And she is not flickering anymore, so I can get a good hit on her, as well? I will go on her. I don't like her, so I'll punch her in the face. Oh, okay. Is this through the cone? Oh, so do I just roll to hit? Okay. (giggles) Spell attack. 16? Shit. How far away am I from both of them? I get ten feet closer to her. This is the rest of my turn. I already used it to inspire Grog. Best question of the night! This is what we hired you for! But has she rolled yet? You're not going to kill him? Is that her right there? No that's Cassandra. I gave her one. I gave her a greater. I'm a nice guy! I can't resist the charm of a woman, especially one who looks identical to you. The lady. Can I Counterspell that? Is he still under her spell? Put her in the Bag of Holding. All right, before it passes, it gives me a quick deep-tissue massage. Have a better sword than your piece of shit? I'll pick it up and look at it. I'll look at it for a whole ten seconds. How far? Here, I'll trade you one. I trade him a greater for a common. I take the common. Greater is 4d4 plus four. Oh, Vax. Hi. She was married to Sylas. Oh god! That looks like a big hand. You know what they say about guys with Bigby Hands? I'm always behind Pike. Oh no, if only we had another gun. Oh, wait. We do. No, we have another gun. Give it to me. No. Hey. Hi, guys! What's going-- oh. She's bleeding all over that thing? She's got blood on it. She's doing a magic ritual. At the orb? You're not going to stop this with an arrow. It's happened already. It's done. It's fine. It wouldn't have done anything. How far? Am I going soon? I've got one shot at this, right? I'm going to try to cast-- I can't cast anything anymore. I'm going to try to cast Suggestion on her, and I will say, Stop, collaborate and listen. Because I'm a gnome who's on a mission. Follow me as I kill your husband the lich, and I'll make you my bitch. Oh, yeah. Whatever. Suggestion is a-- oh, she probably can't be charmed. It's a wisdom saving throw. 19. Never mind! Carry on! There's no attack, there's no nothing? There's no roll? I can't Cutting Words this? I can't Cutting Words? I can't Cutting Words the damage? Damn it. This is it. This is it. Oh my god. On her? So magic doesn't work? You get to kill Lady Briarwood? It's your birthright. I can move within 30 feet of Vax? All right. 23. You might miss, and hurt her. Wait, before you do this have we tried a Healing Word on her? TALIESIN and Where is she? What is that? Twice. Maybe we should get out of here. I'm in there. I go up there, too. Yeah? Okay, I'm going to turn back and go to check out Lady Shithead. I don't know why I'm still in this room. We should get out of here. Alive? Dead? Do we want this girl alive for some reason? I can't move her. Let's just get us out of here. Put it in a vial? Okay, that's smart. Just hit the black hole. Okay, so maybe we don't touch the orb anymore. What do you mean we're not leaving it?! Wait, what's that-- the horn of-- The Horn of Orcus? Can that counter-- we don't have it. Yeah, maybe they'll become a good thing. No? That's what I say to all my women. Sure. Why not? Let's get out of here. Do you want to take Briarwood with us, or bury her in the rubble? You think she was going to jump into that orb? Where is that? Why don't we just seal up the hole and get out of here? We killed the Briarwoods. We didn't die. Yet. LAURA and Hey, Percy? How much does that comic cost? Free.
