As we've previously announced, D&D Beyond is contributing $100 to 826LA for every natural one we roll, and that's a lot! Also, as part of the 826LA charity initiative, now that we're way past our $10,000 tier, D&D Beyond has offered up the discount code "826LA" for 25% off the legendary bundle. The legendary bundle includes all the digital materials available on the D&D Beyond site, so check it out now. A quick history lesson I did some research. D&D Beyond actually, even though it's a popular modern website, it started in the 80s when D&D started to get popular. It didn't catch on because there was no internet, but they still had the website. They did an ad push for it and I found a script from their earliest ad that they put out. It's a little dated. It's a 1980s ad for D&D Beyond, and me and my friends here are going to act it out for you. We fade in on a teenager's room. Knock, knock, knock. Grody to the max, Dad! It's Pet Shop Boys. No duh, and now I'm going to watch 21 Jump Street on that brand new TV network, Fox! Richard Grieco is bodacious! Punchout? Contra? Operation Wolf? Hey, Gail! Where's the beef? Take a chill pill, Dad! D&D is radical. It's as trustworthy as current Democratic presidential nominee Gary Hart. Righteous! Now I don't even want to go see that brand new movie, The Lost Boys, I just want to play D&D! Cut to Travis. This is all heavily researched 1987 facts. What?! No! I've read it. It's good! You get to do a fireside chat. What?! No! That's too much! We did? I was very intoxicated. Give him something. Information, news, something. Cinnamon was his most hated spice! He fucking hates cinnamon! Ashley, even you don't believe that. 22. That's the best thing you've ever rolled on initiative. I run. I run as fast as I can. (screaming) I make a beeline for the opposite corner. Bonus action dash! Keep going! Yeah. Behind that cage. Oh, well, I'll be first to kill it then. Then action, I will hand crossbow up and hold until I see it make an aggressive action towards one of my acquaintances; we're not quite friends yet. Baseline magical? Me too? When it does this, do I release my arrow? Okay, I will release my arrow bolt. That's not good, 14? What do I get, 3d6 right? One for the hit and then-- that's 18 points of damage, but it is not a magical weapon. Hoo boy. What save were we making? Natural one. (cheering) Digital whispers! Oh, great. I'm sorry I couldn't help. 16. No, get away! He doesn't make an attack or anything? Oh shit, oh man. She's already raging. She's mad. Shut up, Matt. (laughter) Oh man. Nice. (whispering) You. (as Jester) I'm trying to be a good healer, but me. There's four pots? Now there's three. Can I see any of them from where-- I will shoot one of the pots with my hand crossbow. Yeah, a lot, 22. It has half-cover or something? The first roll was 22. Six points of damage. Eight is Enough. I'll skitter around towards the candelabra over there, and as I go I'll (cocks crossbow) and fire another shot at the other pot. 19. That one's seven points of damage. No look. (laughter) Oh. Whoops! Rage! Reckless! Endangerment! Diviney! 11. Is his regeneration an ability check? "Any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack must first make a wisdom saving throw. "The spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects." What else are we going to do? We can't heal! Did you just kill her? Let's go look! You're going to die! How small? What's in there? Oh boy, I've already used most of my hit dice. That's crazy. After we've rested for a while, can I walk over to the little hole and peek in? I can't fit through that little hole, can I? All right. Ten. I'll take off my stuff, give it to Caleb for safekeeping, and do you have any butter or anything? I don't want to get wet. Oh yeah! Oil! I'll take some oil! Matt, I'm asking Beau to slather me in oil. Get it in there! Work it in! Mm-hmm! I'm going to Slip N' Slide my way into the hole. It's cool guys. It's fun. I'm going to check for traps. One. Uh-huh! All right. You said there's a few urns that are fancier than the others? What's in the urns? Will they fit through the hole? Those boxes, can I check in those? I'll take the right one. Constitution save? That would be a four. Oh god! Great! It's fine! I'm going to cast Mage Hand and open the other one. No! I've got this! I'm fine! I'll find the treasure! There's nothing else in there? I'm going to take all of those things. Sure, as soon as the hole gets bigger. I'll open the other box with my Mage-y Hand-y! I did it, guys! What's in that box? Do I recognize any symbols or anything? Natural one. Everyone, I found a piece of clothing, an article of (hacking cough) clothing! Here, I'll pass it out to you. It's very pretty. Some art pieces. Some objets d'art! What stuff in the second chest? Huh? What? Who? Huh? Of course, I was just about to get it out here. It's for the whole group. We're a team now. Right? Of course! I would never try to steal from the group. I just-- It's a bunch of gold and jewels. I'm poisoned. (laughter) How much money did we get? Burial shroud? That's his Zemnian accent. Magical traps. With the sword? Oh. No. Ugh. Gross. We have some rings. Well, I know we share everything, but I feel like the ladies of the group would enjoy them more. Maybe we just take them? The ladies of the group? We all get one. I should get one for finding them. I should get one for sharing them. That was a good deed. Fjord gave up his. I'll take his share. That's four for me. Beau, you're naturally beautiful, so I'll take yours-- Damn it. Oh, I have a nose ring! I'm going to swap one out! Don't look! Oh, fuck! I got snot and ash all over it. Oh, by the way, sidenote everyone, out of game, Laura has been taking our inventory and keeping it. Lost the page with all of the-- We have no idea what we have as a party anymore. You're looking for it now? There was something. Evidence of magic? The art, yeah. The vases. Is it just rings, Matt, or were there other things in there? No, you don't have to-- All right. You can have Fjord's ring. Fjord doesn't want one, right? Well, if you read it on the way back, you'll remember it forever. You could mend the big urn that held the ashes of the lich-y thing. Then we can take that urn back and give it to-- They're all on me. Was it the salt-water dream? You need to work on vivid dreams. You can control yourself-- Lucid dreaming, yeah. I don't know. I think it's crystals or something? When you wake up, you just write. What if it rips? I don't think it's a good idea. Why don't we try to camouflage it? We could wrap it in reeds. Sure, yeah, of course. That's normally how I like to travel. How would that work? In front of me? No, I like this. I could drape myself over it. Oh wait, where's our dynamite? Didn't we have dynamite? I mean, boom sticks? Yeah, don't we have two boom sticks? Who has them? Don't we have drugs?! I don't know about this. Let's try Yasha's idea. I think the god of gods wants to say something. And me. You're the motor. Does the river keep going? It could be scary. There could be more rock monsters and things. What time is it? And so would I because I rolled an 18! We could go a little ways, and then come back if we don't find anything. This is a terrible idea. I'll watch over these guys. Bye, guys. You have some sweat right here. In cold water? I don't think it works like that. (Clarota voice) Welcome to my home. Never go full elf. (Singing) Oskar! Spin him around once? (as pigeon) Coo! We're never coming back here, coo! (laughter) It was good. I think if you beg for it, it makes it even better. While they were gone-- (as Jester) Technically can't you remember everything? You just don't understand it? You have a photographic memory, don't you? How about in the place where we disarmed all the traps? We know that that's safe. Well we can't camp in the staircase. That is a staircase. Yes, immediately. (singing) Every time he touches the water he has backstory! Oh, we did a long rest-y? Caleb, you were not, I don't want to jinx it or anything, but I don't think that you were hit in any of the fights yesterday, were you? But you remained pretty much unscathed. And that was the only day that you let me put flowers in your hair, right? I'm saying, maybe, sometimes old wives' tales are true! As an experiment. This is a focus group test thing. I don't know. True. Sample size. I have a lot. May I? I'm going to take some time to put a little braid in his hair, and stick a little flower stem or two in there, and try to make a little flower mohawk. Current Greek. LAURA and Dried blood? Did you shave? You should wear a bite guard. What? You can say it to me then. Is that an indication of other body parts? Do you have anything there? Do you have nubs? What are those? What do we see? On all of the teeth? You had said that you did your own dental work at one point. Did you do that? On purpose? Why? Jesus. But insight check is so much dickisher. Did you do any other bod mod to yourself growing up? Yasha, did you kill any of your fellow children growing up? No. This is how you see yourself, right? Should we go back to The Gentleman? Yeah, but we don't have to do that now! We have a whole boat trip to go. No! Absolutely not. No. Before we go in, I'm going to try to tug on Yasha's leg. Don't you want to carry me? My legs are a little achy. Ah! I try to find a position. We'll stand. And exactly six rings for you. Nine. You can't reach. Traps, which I deftly dismantled. Pressure plates in the lower floor. Nope. Unfortunately, we have to take $100 away from 826LA. (laughter) Seemingly? 17. It's fine, Yasha. After all, I have an empty vial with his saliva in it, so we have that too. As we get clear of the bar, (popping) I'm going to get down off of Yasha. (laughter) It's all muscle. I'm a cool 45 pounds, yo! Yes, I guess so. Maybe I could wipe myself clean with a dry towel. Okay, I'll think about it. Do we know what day it is today? (as Sean Connery) Fetch him now. I'm a Russian sub commander. Oh god. Just you alone? It's a real thing? You didn't make it up? Wait it takes them to the Ethereal Plane? Why you so interested, huh? I will gladly give you money, but first-- I'm going to cast Disguise Self, and turn myself into looking just like a normal halfling little girl and spend an hour at a cafe just having lunch and being a normal person. LAURA and Then after that, I'm going to go, and is there any place if I investigate for a while, is there any place, or service, or person, or anything that can send a package long distance safely? Money being no object. How much to get a package to Felderwin? Five gold? Pretty good, actually. That's cheap. I'll pay for rush delivery. I'll get insurance! TRAVIS and Yes, thank you. I'll write a note, and I'll put in various items. A bunch of buttons, all the rings, door knob, brass baby bottle, all the ball bearings, and the two bracelets. And some money. 50. Disposable? I have 285 gold, and therefore, disposable 280. Here's 280 gold. Already done. Give me the change when you're done spending. Fine. Or not. Oh! You're welcome, young padawan. You have to cast it again! Oh, you're right! It's forever. It's a little muffled. This is really good. I can also hear you across the room though. Sure. Good job. Over and out. Is my flask done? Yes! Wow. That's not an item on DnD Beyond. This is night time? I am definitely in the room. (suspiciously) Hi. (laughter) Do you need some privacy? Sure, you might need me to heal you. It's nice that you guys are talking about your limitations and setting your expectations before you go into this together. There's some word that you need, like a safe-thing? Sure. (grumbling noises) What does that mean? Fragment of Possibility? No he won't! He will never tell us! Caleb, are you okay? You went skinky-doodle for a second. Are you all right? Hello? Hello, Wildemount to Caleb? He can't speak anymore, he's forgotten-- Eins! Zwei! Drei! He's forgotten all language. Quick. Make out with him. True love's kiss is the only thing that will bring him back. Just make out with him! I mean, it was on my mind, but I wasn't going to bring it up. (laughter) Or don't disappoint you. That's not-- not that part. You said, "Oh I wish I could share my problems with my friends." It is. We don't have to tell the others about this, do we? I mean we're supposed to be a team. What? Why would that-- no! We all know what that experience is like. You need extra luck for that. Can I just say, real quick, before we adjourn, there was something that you were reluctant to do because of your own personal fears, and you entrusted Jester to inspire you to do something that was possibly uncomfortable for you, and it worked out great! I think that moving forward if you want to just go for it! As long as you have trusted friends with you, then that would be a good option to do. He's not my son! Get out! Just go! Just leave! Who was it who killed her? (shouting) What does it say? (singing) Mote of Possibility! Custom items? Do we need to dress up, Matt? What kind of festival? This is a winter festival?
