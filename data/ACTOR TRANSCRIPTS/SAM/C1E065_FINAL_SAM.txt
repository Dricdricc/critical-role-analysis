Yes, I do, Matt Mercer. Guys Loot Crate. Loot Crate has been such a great sponsor all year long, and we got another great week to share with you. Speed is this month's theme of the Loot Crate. I'm going to read this script first. Lace up your sneakers or rev your engines. September's all about speed. Feel the adrenaline with some of pop culture's quickest vehicles and characters. High-octane assortment of goodies from Batman, the Flash, the Arrow, the Battlestar Galactica, the Iron Man, the Gone in the Sixty the Seconds. (laughter) Guys, I'm an actor. Why would you listen to me about this stuff? I'm a liar and a deceiver. But what you can listen to, and what you know in your heart, is hardcore facts. I'm talking statistics. I'm talking math. I've broken this down for you guys. If you use the promo-code CriticalRole, you'll get $3 off your first month. Doesn't sound like a lot, you think? Oh, that's 1.2 gallons of gas at the Quik Mart down the street. Regular, unleaded. Or let's say you're generous. You give Loot Crates to everyone in your family. That's four Loot Crates; that's $12. That is 25 and half Forever stamps that you've just gotten for free. For free! Let's say you're more generous than that. You give Loot Crates to everyone in your whole company. All 266 employees. You've just saved enough money to buy a 2002 Kia Sedona with 181,000 miles on it. The transmission is going out, and it doesn't shift in the higher gears, but it is for $800 on Craigslist. Go look for it right now, and it will be yours for free, essentially, if you buy 266 subscriptions to Loot Crate. 266.67. Okay, that is hardcore facts. You can't argue with that. Go out. Subscribe now. Save money. Get stamps and gas. Don't forget to use the promo code CriticalRole. We're nominated for an award, Matt. It's our first nomination. Wait, fans don't get to vote? I'm sure they can influence things. Pan to the fireplace. Yeah, but he's concentrating on the defensive wall right now. That would be awesome. Before we go to Marquet. Let's say Marquet takes 13 days. I agree, but let's say it does. Do we know what we're doing with regards to Draconia when we come back? Do we have some sort of a plan? We're getting a beast. That's all we know. What constitutes a beast? Because me and Keyleth can make some beasts. Like a triceratops? What is that? For me. Ooh, a 19! Plus two. Is it a gargantuan monster? And it was bored with that? And how are we going to get this creature there? On the continent. What continent? The Draconian continent? So we have to go back there to search! All right. This is slightly a better plan than I thought. Then we should go talk to the Slayer's Take now so they can get started on this hunt. A letter?! Who's the letter carrier and how's he going to get out of this city that's protected by an invisible wall? No, we're talking about convincing a dragon to go fight this dragon that would clearly kill it. Wait, is there anyone else who can make this message delivery faster or safer? No, but faster and safer. All right. Strapping boys? Yeah, and they were working on it already, weren't they? I think it's done. It's an incredibly important mission! The Slayer's Take, if I recall, doesn't do things for free. We're going to have to pay for this, even though we're members. We take a contract on an existing creature that we have to somehow find in Draconia. How? Not transcontinentally. No, we're not talking about sacrificing a dragon. We're talking about finding a beast. What do we got to offer? I have a Tome of Leadership worth 30,000 gold. We'll get it back before 100 years are up. A 99-year lease. That's provided we kill it. If we lose, they get nothing. I'm just saying, from their perspective, we're offering them literally nothing. I see this going on, and I stand up on something, and I yell to the students-- I jump up on a chair and I yell to the students Instructor Kashaw has instructed us that this is a drill! You are to attack that man right there, that large man, as a test of your strength and training. Now! 34. (laughter) I try. He wasn't going to kill-- Were you going to kill them, Grog? Oh shit. So wait, what is in this letter? What are we offering them? And to clarify for me. We're asking them-- But wait. TRAVIS and Asking them to help us kill a dragon? No, but that's not what we're asking them. We're asking them to find a beast. I'm sorry. Should we add an NDA? How will he get back? Wait! We got those rocks. We're going to stay here at least a day. Steal an airship on your way back. No, he definitely has a thing for you, Vax. I have a keen eye for these things. Did Kash leave already? Aw, Vax, you didn't get a chance to say anything to him. I've talked to him about this. He has his eyes out on you. I'm a really good reader of people. The dark eyeliner-- Well, one of us doesn't have any luck left, so maybe we should spend the night. Yeah, he's probably squeezing one out. It's okay. This is an early whisper. A first-hour whisper is rare. Well, it's not just Loot Crate, Liam. It's Loot Wear. Those come in a separate bag. Yeah, it's different. You can find out all about it at lootcrate.com/criticalrole. What? It is? Oh my god! And I'm so handsome. I'd like a loose-leaf oolong, please. We literally know nothing about Marquet. Is there anyone that we can say maybe vouches for us or someone who we are against so that we can win favor with the locals? Something like a no-tail, long-tail binary. Well, I can tell you. Thank you. TALIESIN and Why don't we bring Jarett with us? Is that a thing? Okay. Shaun, you do so much for us. We do nothing for you. Is there anything we can bring back for you or messages to give to someone there? Should we go talk to Jarett and then come back? Robes and things? We'll be back in an hour. Oh. I'll drink it. Oh boy. But if we had an extra skin or something, we could trade it. We could give it away, so we should go get one, yeah? Do you know who rules Ank'Harel now? Does the Hand of Ord carry any symbol? Do you know of any way of identifying them? And this other city, Shumble. Humbal. LAURA and In which direction? Good note-taking, Grog. How do people greet each other there in Ank'Harel? Is there a "Kord's "strength be with you" thing? Water is valuable. All right, well, shall we-- To Marquet? To buy a fine pig. Home again, home again. We get there, we start poking people in the eye until someone doesn't flinch, then we'll know we found them. Does anyone speak Marquetian, or do they speak Common there? All right, let's go. Sure, we get some water jugs. How we doing on potions? We got potions? All right, we'll get some in Marquet. Before we go, quickly, guys. I'm sorry. I haven't done this yet, so can I try to see where Kaylie is and do a little scry? Yeah! She's doing good! She's okay! Okay, good! All right! I feel good. Let's go! I had some bad tikka masala earlier. They don't have Middle Eastern food there, I hope! Is there a second floor? Are there stairs? Oh, we're in a room. Let's go out the room. What could happen? Did you find anything good? We're friends of Gilmore. Oh, be pleased. You said Gilmore. Single-handedly protecting a whole city right now. North, northwest. No, northeast. Is there a road to follow, or is it just a direction? Or maybe it's something illicit. LAURA and Or something that you snort. Yeah, we should leave them some water. Grog! Water boy? They are adorable! They're both over 70, so who's going to kill them? Should Grog, or should I? You kill one, I'll kill the other. Some say you can see them still, overhead. (laughter) We're going to mist it? We're tormenting children. How long does this thing last? We'll travel eight hours. At night, will we know where northeast is? Okay. Let's do it. That's thousands. Are we getting to the end of our eight hours anyway? The Hand of Ord is supposed to be super secret. Sure. Should we use our misting while we have it and mist into the city? We haven't committed any crime. They won't even know-- Sure, yes, we can do the mansion. So we've un-misted. Are we going to mansion and go to sleep? All right. We'll do that. Yeah, we'll just go to sleep. I will make the mansion. We going to talk to these people? Great. We go in. I love it. I play a card game by myself. (sneezes) Change up the food? Why? It's nutritious. It's delicious. Ravioli for breakfast? All right. Let's do ravioli. Staff? Could you make us some chicken ravioli? Yummy. Well? Should we go in and be traveling people and kill everyone that we see? What's our angle? We are weary travelers from Tal'Dorei, seeking-- Seeking help? All right, let's do it. We're from Emon, we need help fighting dragons. We'll just go in, big guy. We'll be fine. They're not men, but yes. We are weary travelers from Emon, and we have come to seek assistance with the security of our home. We are seeking a man called... No, I don't think we want to talk to the king. Do we? We would like to talk to J'mon Sa Ord or his or her advisors to seek advice. Me or him? Oh. Okay. It was a million. 34. The big one? Are you a member of the Hand? We need spice. We need to find out about this merchant guy. We got to get laid. Every continent, right? That's our pact. (laughter) Should we split up into a couple parties? No? All right. To the Suncut Bazaar! Oi! Oi, you there, boy! (laughter) That looks like fine fruit. Where would you go to go shopping for things here, market-y things? I've heard that. It's a glandular condition. (laughter) Yes. My cross to bear. I've seen many medicine men about it, but they can't cure it, but many have recommended that I get a diet of vegetables and fruit. Where could I buy some, just like the kind that you have? Okay. I've seen this before. I'm not interested in buying from you. I just want a market or a bazaar or anything. Yeah, that! You're so helpful. Thank you so much, young men, for your help. Also, spice? (laughter) Do you spice? I'm not an authority. Do you spice? Spice it? It's cool. Ignore that part. Thank you so much. What do you think, a little spice? I flip him a coin. Okay. Thank you. They seemed legit! They seemed like they were street kids. They're riffraff. They could know what spice is. They look normal, but I've got a keen eye for these things. I was a kid on the street for a long time. I need a new reed for that. Ooh, Dust of Tracelessness. Is that true? I'm going to plant myself at the end of two rows of the intersection and wait for people to walk by. And as they do, I say Spice? Spice, spice, spice? You spice it? Spice, spice, spice? Spice it? Spice it? Fusaka! A billion. Deception? 32. Yes, hard-to-find spice. I don't know if they have it in this particular bazaar. It takes a seller with a keen eye to identify it. It's not really something that I want to discuss out in the open, but we could take a walk and talk about it. (whispers) He won't know what you put in his hand! Oh, the whispers! So many whispers. How are the Cowboys doing, Travis? I can tell you how they're doing. Oh yeah, sure. Hey, maybe you and me should go to a game sometime. I say I'm cool. (clicks tongue) Yeah. I'm cool. I'm cool on these desert nights, and I need something to warm me up at night, so that's why I was inquiring about this spice. It might not be entirely legal, but fusaka? Where can we meet? I'm staying outside of the walls in a small encampment, but I can meet him sometime tonight inside the walls. How about where we first met, at that same intersection, or is that too busy? I'm sort of a visitor here. There's a casino? Hells yes. Let's meet in a room at the casino. The red room? I'm not familiar with this casino. I'll need some guidance. Okay. That sounds good. Tonight? What time? Oh, sorry. I was thinking about the casino. Sorry. Oh my god. I'm not prepared for this! Enough to get me through a week of heavy use. I want to go on a bender. A billion. More than before. 35. I've had a rough few weeks, and I need to get away from it all and go to that place-- Don't tell me what to do. I can take it, all right? (laughter) It'll be pure, not cut with anything else? I want the good stuff. Am I buying cinnamon here? It's going to be a pound of turmeric! Yes. We have a deal. Let's shake on it. Where did you guys go? Hello? Okay! I'm coming! Where is that? Shit, where am I? I ask around for the Shade. I'm sorry, I've just never done anything that cool before! I just did a drug deal, guys! No! I'll tell you later! They could be listening! I'm coming to you! Hi! Sorry. Didn't mean to sneak up on you. Yeah. I like her. Oi. I made contact. I'm supposed to meet up tonight in the casino one hour after sunset. I'm supposed to wear red. I will not lie, I am shitting myself, I'm so nervous. Well, how else will they discern who I am? I don't want to go alone. Are you cool? Okay. Well... I don't want to draw too much attention, but I want to be safe. But we're going to do it smarter. We're going to do it better. I can do this. I am the one who cocks. (laughter) Okay, I'll wear the red, but maybe you could be there. Okay. No, I think you're great. The big pointy hat, it's really dorky. I know! No, thanks. I'm straight-edge tonight. I've got to think clearly. Oh! Oh my god. Guys, I need you to be clear-headed tonight! Percival just took some. Liquid MDMA. You didn't have any? Don't say the W word! Okay, it's fine now. What time is it? Has the sun gone down? Is that where we're going to sleep tonight? Yeah, we've got some time for that. Investigation. You're terrible at those. I wrote it down correctly, Matt. My contact in the underworld said that this was a place that is a known hangout for seedy types. Right? Am I remembering that correctly? Six. If you do it in a slurry speech, sure. Does she have a normal price? Okay. Okay. The Bowl of Judgment? Arm wrestling match. Cup of Truth? (laughter) What are you asking her? Give away Vex's title? I'm just going to check under the beds, that's it. 29! Sure! Oh, I need a bucket and a mop. But do you know where this person receives her messages? Do we own anything red? Grog? Do we have anything red? All right. I'll find one. Take 20 minutes. Okay, great! It's like Storage Wars. Just buy it. Who knows what's in there? Just buy it. All right. Fine. Let's go. Sure, yeah. One? They must know who we are. Anyone says jenga, kill everyone we meet. Okay. Wow, guys. We did a lot of strange things.
