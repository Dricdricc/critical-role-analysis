And we found her! Is anyone following us? Can we do a quick check around and just see? Perception check? Starting it off with a 19. We should get out of here. He could be in another dimension. Says who? I have a spell that can go to another dimension (chuckles). By the way, this is the best conversation we've ever had with Tiberius. (all laugh) If Grog is close, we still need to get out of the way of these 30 people. So let's go hide. If we do not move, will this 30 duergar mass hit us at some point? Oh, Jesus (laughs) We took too much time! Ten. Distract them. Get them away from us. Can't win with this guy. 14. That's including the ten. 24 hours! But you have to be concentrating the whole time. And you can't. You can't go to sleep. No, we're all in. Let's just make a decision right now to leave Grog and continue on. Let's just forget about him. He was a good friend. We'll have a toast to him. LAURA and We'll sing about songs of his memory. Within a few days we'll forget he ever existed. All right, fine. I was so worried about you! You don't have to do the accent anymore. Are you stuck like this? Wait, but what about Kima? Can you unstone Kima now or? And Clarota was really helpful to us. You can? (all cheer) I know, but we all have to rest. Eight hours, but we have to rest! I'm at two. You're not stealth anymore. You got a busted foot. You're at disadvantage on everything. Can we at least heal you up, before you go? How does it work? She is still close. But once we walk out of here we will be at the same level. We're going to rest. Grog will be fine. Is she doing a standard healing here? Is my song of rest going to help at all? Okay. So I'm going to sing while you heal, if that's all right. Okay, ready? (singing) Wherever you go, whatever damage they've done, we will be right here waiting to heal you. No matter what hit points you take or how your foot breaks, we will be right here-- SAM AND Feet pun! Until then, he's a gimp. Before we go to sleep, I go over to Kima and I say to her, Lady Kima, I think we're all going to take a rest and you as well, correct? We can trust you while we're all asleep not to do anything to any of our companions, correct? Does she seem to be telling the truth? A what? What check? Insight. Okay, 18. Okay. (laughs) Oh my god, what if they start fucking? (all laugh) (clears throat) That would be the kingslayer. Me. (laughing) Oh, okay. We're all a bit cranky. Maybe we should just turn in. Sleep tight. Pike, I'll cuddle you for warmth, if that would help? That's fine. That's what I meant. You know what? We better let that foot heal. We better let it heal. Did you get up? Do we get all our spells back and stuff? I can do things again. The way we came in the city was through the side path, right? So we're already-- But if we keep going, we'll get to the-- Okay! Your Hunter's Mark is gone. So, let's go. Let's just hurry. Unless it melted. Plus ten. 19. Have any of us eaten? They've put him on some sort of stretcher thing. This was some sort of burial ground. What, do you want to fly? Let's just go. What are we going to do? Turn around? Grog's that way. She'd have to do it 20 times. Trinket's a boy?! With a name like Trinket? Why don't we go across. He can come back and get Trinket. With your heavy armor. Oh, Pike. Maybe because you've been killing unarmed people? But you know what? We'll do some good deeds when we're done. I wouldn't say that. All right, let's go. On our stone airplane. Clarota can float. What about you? I'll grab on as well. Why not. Kick him off! We're on you! Have we passed it yet? No, we're floating above it. We've got advantage. We're fine. One of us has guns. By the bones. Trinket is a cat. 12. You're giving us opposite notes. Well you're not on it. You can make a dance floor next to them. She's Wolverine! Okay. Do I have a clean line of sight on her? Or are we too far away? All right, so I think I'm in range. I'm just going to blind the bitch. So I cast Blindness on her. Isn't it a girl? Yeah, well I'm so demeaning to it, I call it a girl. ASHLEY AND Because it is a chauvinist. I know that. I'm looking. I'm drunk! How far am I? I can't even tell. I can't see the board. I can't do it. I can hold my turn? I've never done this before. Okay. I will wait for that, then, and I love women. Biblically. God, Clarota. What? 16. He didn't ask to be dropped there. Panels. Squares. That was an excellent move by a strong, independent woman who doesn't need a man to tell her what to do. Or to validate her in any way. Now that I'm within range, may I go? I'm going to blind him. With Blindness in his eyes. I am using my hand cone. 19. And then I give a little inspiration to Pike. I look over to her, give her a little wink, little smile... That's all it takes. I think so. Where am I? Yeah, I'm staying on that wall, yeah. I don't want to go anywhere, yeah. The whatever it is. It's also blind. Save it for later. Come closer to me! That's a proud choice, and I honor and respect it. I love women! Do I get an attack? It has a maw? Is there anywhere I can stay on the dance floor and get a line of sight with the creature? And can I throw lightning and not hit Tiberius? (nervous laugh) Okay, then. Then I don't do that. Instead, I will-- I've got nothing to do! Let's say I will try to-- is she-- it's a he. I have no ranged attacks. Except I can Viciously Mock it, so that's what I'll do. I'll say, you know what? Your tentacles make you look kind of fat, and the elf thing is played out. It's sort of 1990s. Orlando Bloom. And the whole bone thing is just really tacky! Three! Yes! It's the only ranged attack I have. (all laugh) Oh! And as my bonus action, I'm going to inspire somebody. I don't know. Who? I look over at Liam and I do-- sorry, Vax. And I do one of these. (all laugh) But you've got inspiration. You can roll a d8. Pike, perhaps you should spare it for your god, or offer it in sacrifice to your god? You know what? Women are good at math. Probably better than men. Good adding. It's still alive? Can we undo its healing factor? (garbled) Make a constitution saving throw. Who has to do this? Pike, Clarota? I can roll for Pike. I've got this, guys. We're connected in a special gnome way that you have no idea how pure this bond is. 16, plus whatever. (singing) And that's the power of love! For Trinket? Is Trinket still a cat? Oh, no, your shirt is ripped. Pike, you just took 14. It would have been much more if Scanlan hadn't been around, that's all I'm saying. Oh, snap. Bear down! Not Trinket. Death saving throw?! This is a grizzly situation! The end. What is it with you and Kima? She's fighting with us! Don't dispirit her while we're fighting! I don't like her either, but I'm not openly hostile to her. Sure. I've got it. 24. Do we see any ligatures? Is there sewing? Or has it been stitched together? I'll take out my dagger and dig into his torso. Take them! I take them. Hey, will you lead the way, Pike, with your crazy mace path? How far away is it from us? Let's go kick some ass. Do we need it? Is anyone hurt? We don't need rest for spells, we just need rest for health, right? Your foot. Wow. That was exciting, and I feel empowering to a lot of the female-- (all laugh) Pike did a lot of important things. We're working on it. I'll be watching that! It's my favorite.
