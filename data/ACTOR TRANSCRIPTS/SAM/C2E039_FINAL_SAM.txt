Hi guys. Tonight's ad copy was a little long, so I tried to make a nursery rhyme out of it. I couldn't crack it. I couldn't make it funny. Instead, I decided I'm going to read the copy while they paint my face. That is the bit. Laura and Travis have free reign to paint anything they want on my face. D&D Beyond has teamed up with Beadle & Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse on the platinum edition of Waterdeep Dragon Heist, which releases in November. If you don't know what Beadle & Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse is, it's the brainchild of friend of the show Matt Lillard. They make these fantastic boxes filled with all the elements a dungeon master needs to create an amazing experience. That's in my eye.

(laughter) Before we started rolling, this paint smells like farts. But only when it's painted on a human face. (laughter) Beadle and Grimm's, dndbeyond.com/promotions/platinum. No, no. Wait, is that tomorrow? No. Spoilers! I think tomorrow is goat yoga. Featuring Travis Willingham and friend of the show, TJ Storm. It's going to be fun. There's goats involved. There's yoga involved. We talk LA. It's great. Butts and taints. (Australian accent) G'day mate! Do you know all the rules and stuff? (whispering) Uk'otoa! We got strength. 14. Where are you? Where are you? I'm just going to say this, as players last time we encountered a group of people, we killed them all. They hadn't done anything to us. I'm just saying. Okay, kill them all. I don't know, sure sounded like we were being shamed. "They're not wearing any weapons, they're "just here for ceremonial reasons." That one uses her turn to cry. I think they have a lisp. I'm just a snake person! That hits. Uncanny dodge! So what's that, four? Oh man. Do some monk shit! Looking really rough? (screams) Nott will, from prone, fire a shot at-- actually, will load a burning bolt-- I have one left-- and fire it at snake creature, the hooded one. Okay. Ooh, yeah, 22. Ooh, yes. (counting) 26. Plus I'll use Fury of the Small, why not? 31. Plus the burning bolt, what does that do? I didn't write it. Wait, no, it says 1d6 fire damage. Another two points! It's got that snake hood that's very thin, I assume. I don't know. I don't know how hiding works, but I'm going to hide. I know that this thing over here will see me, but can I hide right there, hiding from the vision of that one? Does that work? Can you hide from one person? I'm going to crawl over there and hide. I'm going to hide. 23, but I think because I'm wearing the hood or whatever-- Okay, still 23. Ooh! I did my math wrong. Not that it matters; fury of the small is six points of damage, so it would have been 34 points of damage. I'm so excited to find out when he will turn on us. Ooh. Yes. No, Caleb, no! But you're a wee man. Yeah, but it could prevent-- Okay. You're a lost cause, basically. Oh! You guilted him into healing you. A what? (whispers) Sexy. But I'm hiding! Denied? Great. I'll take that whatever it's called. Yeah, thank you. Okay, so that's six total points. Oh my gosh. All kinds of checks. Are they gone yet? Ah, I was here the whole time! Good idea! I'll go check the fountain. What are these big fancy-- are these doors on the sides? 19. I hate water. You're going to what? Trash chute. That was the sacrifice tablet on top. TRAVIS, LAURA, and Oh, that's why it's all grimy. It's blood water. Ugh! Does it look like those vacuous eye holes in the snakes are about the same size as those rubies that I had found? Can I just-- --look for traps? Can I just look for traps around the fountain without touching the water? 11. Me? Sure, I can, but that seems like more of a medical thing. Do you have a medical kit? I was looking for traps, I don't think I found it with an 11. Most of them? Caleb is way worse than her. Are we plugging up the holes first or are we just watching them? He's excellent! He can make one thing into another. We used to have this trick where we would sell people a magical box that could turn a copper into a silver. Ooh. Did we use that one on you? Why don't we just shove the dead people in there, and then if we see the dead people moving we'll all draw our weapons and attack whatever comes out. Take some legs and arms and just shove them in the holes. We need to chop-- Yasha, chop off all their arms. Jester, chop off all their arms. Nice. Look at you, Mrs. Medicine. Maybe it's a magic disease. Maybe she's got two diseases. As we're mounting up or getting ready to do something, I'm going to go over to Jamedi Cosko and just say Hey, Jamedi. Wow, that was a tough battle. Oof, I need a drink. Do you want one? You do drink liquids, don't you? Well then, why wouldn't you want a nice little nip of something? It's really good. I have some jerky. Do you want a little nibble? You do eat food, don't you? Here. Is he swallowing? Ten. All right. He's not a zombie. Is it time? It's time? Before we go down the fountain, I'm going to walk past Jamedi again. Hoo boy, it's going to be scary down there. I think what I'm going to do is-- I'm going to take out the snake idol thing and-- I'm going to do a quick prayer to my god. Do you want to pray with me? Do you worship this one, too? I just want you to be part of the team. We're a tolerant group. To a point. Maybe not tolerant. Let's go! All right. I'm going to ruby it up. There was two vacant eye holes? I'm going to put all of them in! I have three-- oh. One was stuck to the back of another one. That's how rubies-- Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm going to one at a time using Mage Hand. We're between floors now? Blood. It's a blood orange orchard. Mm-hmm. I love me some rotten fruit. All right, I'll jump down to the platform. Ooh, yeah. A check? 26. I'll take a drink. (huffing) I'm going to start going down the steps and feeling my way for traps and stuff. Is that cocked? Okay, I can't tell what it is. That's a 17 for investigation. Are there any fruits lying around on the ground? I'll pick one up and smell it. (sniffing) Do I like it? I'm going to lick it. I'm just taking a little bite. I'll just eat one. It's clear, come on down! He's checking his Twitter. He's fine. No, to the staircase. It's a ten-foot fall. No, she jumped already. It's you, Caduceus, and Fjord, I think. You can do that? Wow! Yummy. Oh no! What is happening? (giggling) Oh, yes. You should try some of this fruit, guys. Six. Man, this is the craziest place we've ever been. Do that more. It feels nice, the wind. Do that more. Slower. Just let me enjoy this. (laughter) Oh! Hey! Hey! Ah! (laughter) Oh sure. I'm going to sit. I thought I was already picked up. (gibberish) Oh! What, huh? I see glowing symbols. They're so fucking bright! Wait, you can't see them? You can't see this? You can see me, can't you? (screaming) Stop this! I can't take any more! (sobbing) I've seen too much. I think that's the right order. I don't understand any of this shit! Seven. Do you want me to draw what I see? Okay. Intelligence check. 13. I'm going to take some time to start painting my skin, and drawing my skin because it feels so good. Is this good enough for him to discern? I'll go! TRAVIS and I protect him! It's so far! You can see words. Need water. The 'nother one? The what? I'm the warden? I don't feel wardeny. It feels like there's a vine around me, but I know it's not real. It's fine. I am trying to cast Teleport. I do not have Teleport. I'm trying it anyway. Okay. Con save, 18. I think it worked! Remember, Laura, you do have a weasel around your neck. 23? Nice. These are creatures? Bad-ish. Damn! I'm out. 16? Great. It's the top of this round. (singing) Check, check, check, check it out-- I'm a little confused. "Put that stud muffin down so I can make out with him!" Whoa, that's tons. (panting) That... was... amazing. I would do it again in a second. Holy shit. I mean, we used to mess around with chemicals, but nothing like that! (excited laughter) Did you see that?! How is my hand as big as yours now?! It doesn't make any sense! Remember that there was those-- Eggs are always good in D&D. Why is everyone yelling? Yeah! Course I can! That's a vast cavern down there. Okay. Which one are we near? Which one had the stairs going down? The stairwells? Yeah. 14. I'll be back in five minutes. Oh. What? I don't know. What do I see? There's some carvings, and there's a moving staircase. It's not moving fast, it's just going back and forth. Is there light or any keyholes or any switches or--? I'm fascinated by the walls. I rolled a 28. Nope. Didn't find any. I'll take some for the road. Just to hold. You must know all about that! Ah! Ah! Caleb, he's talking to you! We've been down here for days! (laughter) Do the stonies get disadvantage or anything? 20. Guys, D&D Beyond has partnered with Beadle & Grimm's to paint my face. Check it out! You get $50 off. Dndbeyond.com! It's a symbol or shape! Take what? We do. It's a little something we like to call-- SAM and (crossbow locking) I've got my explosive arrow nocked. Think about this. She throws it, I fire, it explodes. No structural damage, only damage to the creature. That's how I see it going down. (laughter) Like you, with the keg. What's that? But it won't kill the thing. That's not enough! (crossbow locking) TALIESIN and I've cocked this thing three times! He's the invisible friend. Fjord. Counterargument (crossbow locking) (laughter) It will deafen the creature. It might bring some rocks down from the ceiling. No! It'll make a big puff of smoke. No one will be able to see. Yasha's crying now. (laughter) Not in smoke! Yeah! We make a bunch of smoke, the thing is like, "I don't know what's going on!" I think that's about 15 to 16 votes if my eyes don't deceive me. I've never been thinking clearer than right now! I see this working big time. Or carry the keg in with your duplicate and do both! But Plan B! (crossbow locking) (tension releasing) Fluffernutter? I can shoot at something. Can we peek in without it seeing us? I'm going to take off my explosive bolt and put on a reg. You're going to float your dupe across the water, and as soon as you say go, your dupe casts? Sure, but your dupe floats. We're assuming that the snake creature's asleep? Just float your dupe in, and when you say go, I'll shoot. I'm more than 30 feet away, so I think I shoot at disadvantage. Wait-- oh, she attacks with advantage. I'm think I shoot at disadvantage because I'm longer than 30 feet away. So that's a ten. Can I bonus action? No, this is a single sneak attack action. Cool. (arrow whizzing) Do I get advantage on the attack if I'm hidden? The first one I rolled was a 12 plus eight is 20. Oh, okay. I rolled-- let's see here, sorry. I rolled a 15 and I will use-- because we short rested? I'll also use Fury of the Small again. So that's 21. Fluffernutter would have totally obliterated it. We wouldn't have even had to fight. 18. You're going to run all the way to the snake? (dramatic yelling) I'm a monk! Under the paper. Ah! I'll go in to the left. Into the left as far as I can. Yep. I think I was just at 30. On the way, I'll fire another crossbow bolt. Ooh. Not good. 16. Is it engaged with Jester's dupe? Boo. I rolled a six, though, so that's 11 points of damage. Ah! Jesus. As it strikes and maybe looks down to see where I got it, I'll bonus action hide behind the pillar. Okay. Ooh! 29 to hide. 18 points?! From a bow shot? Ooh. Wait, are you resistant to poison? Oh no. A second shot? Oh my god. Don't draw attention. Go away! (in deep voice) Hunger of Hadar. Nice. Useful. Beauregard. You are super fast! Super fly. It's a bunch of people waiting in line for the bathroom. I really have to go. Can I go before you? Thanks. (music) (French accent) Into the fray! Do those tentacles attack good guys, too? That's the biggest thing I've ever seen! Yeah, you did get us. Oh no. Oh. No. Stop. Don't. Ooh! So many d's. Hydra is down to 500 hit points! Get out of there! Get out of there! Get out of there! No! Get out of there! Sure you can. I guess I don't see eyes on the other thing, so I will step out and fire at one of those heads. Terrible. I don't have any sort of advantage, right? 11 points. I was hidden. 20 to hit! Okay! (counting) 16. (fearful yelp) I will shout out, Fluffernutter! I'm going to go back behind the pillar and hide. Yeah, and I'm hiding. 20. Oh no. Caleb, I think it's a hallucination. Fluffernutter. You got hit with 30 points of damage, too, so that's concentration. Didn't you do something that makes it more vulnerable to its next hit? Just do-- Nott the Brave yells to her teammates The colors are so vivid! Then also Everyone back up, we're going to Fluffernutter this bitch! I will (cocking crossbow) and hold my action. Yeah. Ah! Waiting for a keg to be thrown. (cocking crossbow) Fluffernutter! I don't care about Avantika. You're Patient Defense-ing, right? You're fine. What else does Slow do? It can't use reactions! Aim high! (cocking crossbow) (yelling) Do I get any advantages? 12. Would've been fucking amazing. Liam, we ended the last round, did Fluffernutter, we won. Four new heads?! Wait, even the ones that were cauterized? Grew back as four? I don't know what a hydra is. I'm not a dork. Me?! We just did Fluffernutter! Is your dark spell still up so we can't see anything? Well, that's where it went. It's not wet. You mean kegs that hold beer and wine and are completely waterproof? I will stick my head out and shoot the hydra. 13. Wait! I'm hidden. 18! (counting) Oh 23! Bonus action, I hide again. Blow that head! Travis loves blowing four heads! So much molasses. Come on, Jester! Just light a torch. We'll find out. Oh? When did that happen? Nice. Every time one of these heads comes back, does it gain hit points? Yeah! Avantika! 18 misses you? Right, because you're Hasted. That's crazy. Where are you, Beau? Oh shit. Oh god. Do I see the keg? Why? Yeah, but this guy is up there fucking your shit-- He's not in-- I will peek around and fire at that guy, whatever that guy is. The abomination. That's a 19. That's-- 20 points of damage. I'll run up to that keg. Bend down. Then shoot one more shot. 24? Ten. (cheering) I'm standing on the water holding my keg. Guiding Bolt up its ass. The neighbor finds lots of minis in his yard. Hi Beau. Give it a couple years. Do Patient Defense! Ooh, confusion technique. Smart, smart, smart. She's so brutal! This is some good shit! Oh shit!
