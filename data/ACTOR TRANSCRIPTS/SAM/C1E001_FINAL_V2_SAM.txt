Nice. Audio isn't working they're going to watch something else. Thanks, douche. (laughter) I'm Sam Riegel a voice actor, and stuff. My character is Scanlan Shorthalt. The gnome bard who sings a lot. Let's start playing, yeah? (cheering) In the city of Kraghammer? Wow! This is fantastic. That's fantastic. Greyspine? We have to go find him, don't we? Of course. I've got a lot of booty that I need to stow. Can you stick with us? You're the only one that speaks Dwarvish. Is that the name of a place? All right. Which way to the Pig Pits, sir? Smells in here. An octagon? Excuse me, miss. You. I'm sorry? Adra! You run a fantastic establishment. Thank you for welcoming us and allowing us to buy this round. Well, thank you for your hospitality. Might we inquire about staying here the night? Do you have an inn with the establishment? Several rooms, or just one? That would be nice. Something with a little bed for me. Oh, okay. Grog, you and me. I can sleep on your feet. We're penny pinchers. I'd say a week. Sounds good! The Car Verse? Already, Grog?! Another time. Nostoc? So the lower levels would have the mithral mines? There's one? Down at the quarry? Goblins? A lot to process. Thank you for your time, Adra. Carry on with your evening. We'll seek you out if we have any more questions. Yes, fellows, what should we do? Agreed. Although, that does sound fun. I'm coming with Grog. I take out my flute and I play a little Healing Words spell and try to heal him of his drunkenness. Huh, I don't know where that was coming from. Why is he doing this? Boobs! Assmanes? I think that's a friend of yours. We're trying to find out more about Greyspine. Where he might be or who his associates might be. So you roll twice. What might they like? Let's just do it. Just go for it. Where might that door be? Maybe if we drank some of it it would fit. Yes, very helpful, young man. Are there suggestion cards here? Confidence needs improvement. All right, shall we go to the manor? 500 or 600. All right, yes, let's go sleep. Well, then we have time to do other things. Is there any recon that's going to happen tonight? Do you need any help? No, I don't want you to say yes. She's feeling ill. Does she need to lie down? We'll find out next week. Grog and I go in search of a, shall we say politely, whorehouse. Is Grog going to find someone his size? We'll take it. What sort of ladies will we find there? What species? And that's our choice. I'll take a dwarf. Louder! (snorts) They're posing as the Howells? Oh jesus. If only I was there. Am I currently being beaten by a whore dwarf or anything? Constitution check? 18! Plus two! 20. Yes! I'm sex checking. (grunting) That's a good voice! This is why we go to brothels instead of sneaking around at night! Hugely important! Balgus? There's a baby right there. Episode one. Tiberius kills himself. You're alone. I am snoring after having sex. (exhausted sigh) How was your night? (singsong) I have hickies. (laughter) Yes. What? Success all around! Did you learn anything, Vex and Vax? I'll get it! (clears throat) Hello? Oh! What?! Are you going to fucking fight him? What?! Are you going to fight him? Jesus, I don't like rats, but I'll keep it. Okay. It's okay. I'll protect it. Don't worry. Don't bet against the enemy! He's a really good fighter. Remember, he's our friend. We don't want to kill him. Don't kill him! Trinket's in my hands. Jesus. I start playing music from my shawm instrument. Which exists. A rousing jaunty bear-like tune. Sure, I would love to give her an inspiration dice. (singing) Oh, look over there! It's a bear! Yeah! Who, me? No! It's a natural 20! We're going to get money for this? Why don't we adjourn for the evening? Retire to our rooms? Why don't you wait until we're upstairs? Here, rat-mouse-thing. Oh, Grog's going to fight him at some point. No, let's get it on. You guys are so kind with these comment cards. The humans? You okay? Commercial break. Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day, he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon. Oh, Jesus, we should have all talked about this while we were all peeing. Are we going to the manor? Eggs benedict. Shall we try to make our way to the manor, then? Did you catch that? He just turned himself into a dwarf. He's very handsome for a dwarf. Oh yeah, what kind of dwarf? A lady dwarf? How many are there? That's you. Like Johnny New York. We're in Kraghammer. Johnny New York. See, he is one of you! Let's go knock on the door. Should we ding-dong-ditch? (laughter) I'll start singing a little jaunty welcoming song. (singing) Hello, hello, we're here to pay you calling. Hello, hello I don't know what rhymes with calling. Yes, it's true. Yes, for now. If Gradon is here, is that his name? Gradon? And some very, very attractive mining contracts, but if there's no one here to talk about them-- Jesus. One moment, before we adjourn-- (whispers) Do we want to try to get into this place, or are we just going to go to the mines? And ditch this place? I'm going to turn invisible. And I'm sneaking into the house. I don't know why! I don't know! Give me 20 minutes! I follow him where he's going. My nervousness, I let out a little bit of a fart as we-- 14 plus I'm invisible, plus two. 16. Oh, well. 14. Plus two. 16. I'm snooping around, trying to see if there's any lords or higher ranking individuals in the area. Shawm. Oh fuck. I'm so tempted, but no. Just me and him. He can talk to me, apparently. Great. Not going to try. Shit. There's nothing to steal! I might as well try one of the doors that's locked, and see if I can pick it, but I'm not good at that, so I'll try. I have a forgery kit, a poisoner's kit-- Climbing gear? And a whip. Can I reply? Just trust me that I have no idea what I'm doing. Yeah, I'm going to try one! Of course I do. 11, plus zero? I can't do two spells at once, so I will give it up and I'll make my way to the door. I become un-invisible and I cast Dimension Door. It was crazy in there! People were farting everywhere! It was not me. They're building a throne room, there were some locked doors. Man, I wish you could have been there! It was exciting, but ultimately pointless. Let's go down to the mines! She wanted to stay at the inn this morning. Let's make our way to the mines, shall we? Just swords out. Are you a dwarf still? What are we trying to do? Hello, hi! And it's for Nostoc. We should have talked this through before. Wait! Mister Greyspine. Oh, okay, all right. A lady, in fact. The dwarf is a feminist. This cost us a thousand gold. Which way do we go? You're stealing beer?! Fuck those guards, I can kill them all. Oh! Ah, I don't like these guys. Did you do that? Fuck. Fellows. I don't like goblins. I don't like goblins. No, they will all die. Don't spare any of them. I got a three. We weren't ready. He said he moved within 60 feet of them. 8d6. I'm hard right now! Insight check? Oh shit. From the ogres? May I make a request that you kill them anyway? Oh crap. You speak goblin? Right. We're out of combat. I'll move up to the right near where Grog is. No one's has taken any damage yet, right? I can't inspire anybody here? Now? Can I inspire everyone? I'll inspire Vex and Vax and Grog. (plays tune on electric piano app) Not yet. Don't donate yet. Donate next week. Don't forget your inspiration! Oh, okay. What? Why me? No, that's not me. Keyleth dies in episode one. No, she's okay. (singing) Yeah! (laughs) As one does. Tell our story, Keyleth. Can I bonus inspire myself? (singing) It would help me to acquire some dice to inspire. (speaking) I inspire myself first and move five feet back so I'm on the same row as him. Not that far. Yes. Them I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt at him. Straight line, that way. Oh! I didn't even need to inspire. Thank you. (counting) 24! Yes. (sings a high-pitched note) I've never killed anything before! The bolt of lightning begins in its tail and works its way up through its spine, slowly but painfully torturing it as it slowly, slowly feels the effect coursing through its evil body. Can it have a lightning bolt shaped in an "S?" Thank you. Just promise me you'll that tell Pike about this. Because it was really cool, right? Okay, good.
