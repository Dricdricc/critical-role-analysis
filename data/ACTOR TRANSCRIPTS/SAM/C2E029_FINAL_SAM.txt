D&D Beyond did not want me to sing a song, so I have one. [laughter] (singing) At Gen Con, I'm surrounded by my friends-con, Ashly, Marisha, Matt, Taliesin-con. They'll be by my side 'til the end-con! At Gen Con. (spoken) There's a second verse; I'll go through it fast. D&D Beyond might drop us tonight, because what I'm doing here, it just ain't right. I'm not advertising their Facebook page, or telling you the promo code GENCON2018 is what it is like I promised backstage. But this little stud's got to follow his heart. And maybe some other body parts. So if they'd want to know who to blame, why don't you just tell them by shouting my name? (singing) At Gen Con, I'm not even going to pretend-con. My outfit definitely offends-con. You can all see my rear end-con. At Gen Con. Thank you! [cheering] Oh, are we taking off our shirts? Oh, wait. Wait, what? (shouting, extended) No! [cheering] That's a handsome shirt. Mercer! (screaming) [click, TV static] [groovy Critical Role theme] [cheering] Matt, do they have matching Huey, Dewey, and Louie themed bed sheets? (laughter) Ah! There's two coming, Caleb just-- oh wait, I got it! Caleb just warned me there's two men coming down the stairs to us. Let me get out my copper wire. It's just us and Mr. Clay. Wait, you guys are dressed like guards still. Ooh. Down the stairs? I'm not following, what are we doing? Am I an escaped prisoner? You're going to go attack these people with--? All right. Sounds good. That's double digits! The audience's support counts for one. Matt, are they in the little hall just outside the-- Can I sneak into the far hallway that is away from the kitchen? Oh yeah, that's a one. I'm going to hide, just in case they come this way. Oh shit. Mr. Clay, I am a woman, I know you're new here. (laughter) Let me go! I didn't do nothing wrong. (cries out) He's going to roll. He's going to do something. I've got a seven Matt. We've got this. Can I peek around the corner where he just ran? Leave no one alive! I'll fire. 27 to hit. But it's not sneak, right? Six plus five, 11 points of damage. And a bonus action, I'll shoot again. That is a 21 to hit. With another six points of damage. Ah! Mr. Clay, I apologize. That was a good plan. It was so easy! Ah, let me go! I'm crazy! Ah! Kill it! Kill it! Okay. Kill it and follow it. MARISHA and I didn't know you could-- Oh, the scroll. Oh. Good job, Caleb! Let's go downstairs. I'll go first. (gasps) You don't need to do this, Caleb, if you don't want to. I'm going to go up and peek around. 27. Not hearing Caleb for a while, I'm going to, again, creep down the hallway and peek around a bit. Can you do some magicky things, Mr. Clay? Something? Can I shoot? I would like to shoot. I'll shoot at-- it's Protto and Ruzza? No. 18. Guys, come on. I know we want to make it interesting for the audience, but come on. Paperwork! LIAM and (singing) Any old time! Is Protto still in the room? Can I see him? I would like to shoot him. But first, I'll run closer so I'm within 30 feet. Yeah. Oh god. There's probably traps. Oh shit. Did I die? Okay, cool. I will shoot my crossbow. Oh, that's no good. 12. No, 13! One more shot, bonus action. That's better, 19! That's ten points of damage! (yelp) Have I done all of my movement? Yeah? I'll just duck over towards Shakäste so I'm not right in eyeline of either of the hallway baddies. Why do I keep running into things? I need contact lenses. Oh! Caleb! Caleb, is that you? All right. It's not working. Are you out? You're outside of the room. I don't think you're in. Matt Mercer! First the T-shirt and now this? You bastard! Oh yeah, that hits. For sure. Okay. Yes, fine. Oh wait, I can take my little-- my reaction, can't I? What is that thing called? Uncanny Dodge? Uncanny Dodge! I'll reduce that to three. More like a staycation. He's so calm under pressure. He's like a walking quaalude. [laughter] Oh, no. Whoa. Never mind. I think they're in love. Oh, that's a good roll. Sacred Flame, save. You said dex? Get a room, guys! Oh, me? Again? I just went! Great. I'm going to run up to the cage. Do I still see them? Through the portcullis? All right, I'll take a shot at Ruzza! Pew! That's 25. I get to roll, but still no sneak attack, damn it. Six. I guess I'll shoot again. Yeah because I can't lift this thing, and I'm a wee thing. No, I can't. I'll just shoot again. That's an 18. That's 11 points of damage. Ah! These are rolls! These are good rolls today. Then I'm going to duck around again so they can't see me. Just anywhere. Aah! Are there duplicates of you? How are you doing this? Ah! You are amazing! Guys, this material does not breathe. Natural 20! [cheering] Get a room you two! (laughter) Is he flipping you? Whoa! You can just do that? Boo! Darts away? Marisha, did you just look at me? Is that what's happened? That's why you're suddenly laughing? We saw that? It's that big headdress. It's getting in the way. Yeah, restart it. Sometimes that what's you got to do with Nefertitis. Nott's going to run up to the cage and reach out with her Mage Hand and try to flip the switch. I'm going to inch around Nefertiti. Excuse me, Mrs. Titi. Pardon me. Is Protto still there, or did Protto bug out? And Ruzza's still there? All I see is a hallway and a swarm of bees? Okay. I don't want to go through the swarm of insects. I don't know what would happen. Oh Jesus. I will run through the swarm of insects, and bonus action disengage from them! I don't know if that works! Just in case, I grab some chopsticks and I catch one. Can I duck back behind the corner, or am I exposed? Question did we ever get the father and son out of the cage? Sure, yeah, if there's no threat. I'll scan for traps as I walk. Yeah, motherfucker! 24! Best rolls of my life! I am the greatest rogue alive! I will go try and disarm that trap. Well, with my Mage Hand. It's plus seven? 20 even. Oh. So I can't disarm it. So we can step over, around it? Yes! Wow! Caleb! Are you right next to me? No. A dungeon in a dungeon? Maybe it's only one point of damage! (groaning) Which door? The door that I just checked or the next door? In the hallway that leads to the first chamber. You know about more rooms than I do. I just checked the door in the front of the first room. I don't see-- I don't know what you're saying. Waft your smell in the direction that-- Is that the door that I checked? No? Yes? Oh, the door! The door, okay. I'll check the door. Why don't you check the cage for these fellows? That's a 17 on investigation. Wait, what about these people in the cage? (shouting) Just eat the berry! Eight. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! You're the worst person. I'm going to use Mage Hand to unbind his hands. (whispering) 14. Intermission. Tinnitus? Ugh. You've got this. Sure. How you doing over there, Shakäste, with the gates-- the cage? But that goodberry... (laughs) We're deputizing the guy we just freed? We'll come back for them! We'll come back for them. Did you see a blue tiefling or a green, sort-of-gradient-colored half-orc, and maybe an amazing-looking white and sort-of, kind-of-black, dark angel thing? Projects? I don't like that-- Are you looking for traps or anything, or just looking? Aah! Um, I'd prefer a nature check? Is it-- the brazier, it's in the wall? It's inside the wall? Can I Mage Hand grab it and throw the bowl across the room? That looks like a big bowl. I don't know. I don't think I can lift that. How do we get down there without the fire thing happening again? Ah, oh. Wait, Caleb, are you in the room? Ten minutes? No! Wait, what is it, what are you doing? Dispel? You can do Dispel? What can't you do? Why weren't you always playing this character? Good job, Caleb! Let's go, yes! She's very passive-aggressive. You have two potions, don't you? For the clerics to weigh in? Whoa! You have two of those? Damn! Oh, man! Smoking is great. (laughter) That's great. Ugh! [applause] How long is this break, Matt? What is this, ten minutes? 12 minutes? How-- Everyone check out the D&D Beyond booth! Love you, too! [cheering, shouting] We got this. Are we on the internet right now? We're on? You'd like to what? The map looks like a cock and balls! [laughter, cheering] Have you seen me? You can see me. So we are inside the-- we've lifted open the hatch, right? There's no other doors going down to the downstairs, right? That's it. Wait, no! Caleb is invisible. I mean, I don't want to lose you, but-- And you're noisy af. What if this-- they know you, right, Keg? You could say, "All right, I'm coming down, Lorenzo!" I'm a pretty good-- I'm like Rich Little. Then I could send-- I could send down an image of you that looks like you, and so if they attack right away they'll be fighting against just an illusion! Thank you. Not of substance, if that's what you mean by substantial. Wherever you are. Okay. (kiss) (laughter) As big as Keg, yes. Keg's not very big. Well, she'll make the noise. I'll make the video. Yeah. I can try-- I can certainly try! [cheering] Ah, okay. Okay. Will I try? Okay. I mean the second thing is more you. That's true. But, you know if you see him again, though, you can't go back to old material. You need some-- Fuckface is different. I would say Eat shit, you rusty spoon! I don't know. Oh, you know he doesn't have any hair. Maybe you could be like Baldy McGee! Yeah! Making fun of someone's appearance is very good. Yeah! Yeah! Uh huh. We're drawing them out, and then once we know their position, I guess we'll just run and gun? Okay. All right, so you start with an, "I'm coming down," or something and then you'll "come down." I drop a bit of fleece and cast Silent Image and make Keg walking down the steps. Rattle! Rattle! Rattle! It's a radio play! Ooh! With coconuts you can make it sound like horses! Wait, me or her? It's middling. Okay, and starts like, narrowing its eyes and looking around. Just sort of mean and maybe gets a cigarette. I don't know how she has so many of them. Does she roll them? I don't know. From which side? The image of Keg falls to the floor, clutching her shoulder. Okay. I make Keg's hand fall off. (laughter) Aah! Okay, step one went really well. What do we do now? This seems a bit far. It could be someone under the table. Yes it's someone-- From under the table, and also from somewhere else. Well we know that Protto shoots arrows, right? And then someone else could be the other one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's them. Wait, we're going in? Sure! I'll run down the stairs and I'll fire as soon as I see anything. Me? 12. Plus nothing, Taliesin. It hits! I will dodge uncannily. Sorry, Mr. Clay. 22. That's a very big hit. Four piercing damage? Can I also uncanny dodge that, or no? You know what? I won't, just in case I want to react to something else. Did Protto duck or anything? So I cannot see The Devil Wears Prada? Okay, I will run over to the table, and poke over it, and shoot Protto. [cheering and laughter] Hello! 12. I'm going to fuck you up-- Oh, shit! (laughter) I will reload and fire again! That's 20. Aw, that's cocked. Okay, ten points of damage. I'll duck down. (chanting) B-B-Beau! Good god. That's great! Oh, that's not good. Squatty Potty. Aah! Oh, Lorenzo! He has such good mic technique. (laughter) Jesus... Damn. Shakäste! (singing) Titi! Nefertiti! Ugh. Whoa, the audience turned. Are you talking about me? Ooh, ugh. Mistake. Am I in melee range of Protto? Okay. I am going to run away. Towards Shakäste, and as I go, I will turn around and fire a crossbow bolt at Protto with sneak attack because-- Aw, fuck you! It's only a 12. How much more movement do I have? I'll use my bonus action to fire one more bolt at that stupid Protto. That's a 22 to hit. No sneak attack though, right? Matt? No sneak attack, or-- Okay, that's 17. I'll keep moving as far as I can get around that wall. Great. End him. I imagine when Beau walks down the street, it's all parkour. She parkours! Yeah, do it! (kung fu movie accent) Flurry! All right, one down. Ooh! [cheering] Take that, Wu Tang Clan. Oh, shit. Caleb? Stay safe, Caleb! Oh, he's trying. He's working the angles right now. He's thinking about all of the great stuff available at D&D Beyond. Oh, he's so weak! Shield! Shield! Shield! (cooing) Shield! (coo) Oh no. Matt, where is The RZA on the-- Oh no. Here. Shakäste! Rage. [laughter] You've got to do it in Egyptian! Is anyone engaged with The RZA? I will attack The RZA. Not good, 16. Oh, no-- yeah, 16. That's 17 points of damage. Us ladies have to stick together. Is she still alive, The RZA? I'll shoot one more time, why not? That is 17 to hit. Just seven that time. Yep. I'll just say-- Bards suck! (laughter) Back up even further, away from any danger. Yeah. Oh, in the testes area up there. The little closet thing that's-- yeah, that's good. This table, man. He's going to decide to turn over a new leaf, and-- Yeah, sure. Yeah, gets his license on the second try. (laughter) You guys tried-- God, this guy. Matt, there's an audience here that deserves a certain amount of death and payoff. Wait, you're looting?! (stage whisper) Liam, don't you have a potion or something? I mean-- (cooing) Weirdly, the map looks even more like my penis now. Me? I'm going to peek around the corner; do I see anything or anyone to attack? No, I will stay tucked in my little closet. Is there a way I can hide but still see around the corner? No? Nope. I mean 15, it's decent. I'll just hold my action until I see something. A crossbow bolt, ready to fire. Use your bow and arrow. Ooh! Yeah! Yeah! Why don't you heal? (pigeon coos) Heal. Okay. (pigeon coos) Oh no, ghosts! Wait, I did not see Caleb in that cone. Missed. Rolled a nine. Rolled a nine. What? What is that number? Why are you saying that? You got this. Come on, guys. Ugh! Oh boy. Guys... A little gardening. What does that do? Oh god, me? I guess I'll poke around and just take a shot. I can't do anything else! I'll run in closer so I'm within 30 feet and then fire. I miss. Bonus action fire. 18. That's nine points of damage. Then I'll run back to my cubbyhole. He's stunned? You're a golden god! We need you guys every week. How do you want to do this? Lay it on. 16? You can't see me. Worst prop ever. I'll do the same thing. Poke out. Shoot. Is Lorenzo engaged with anyone? Okay. 19 to hit. Let's finish this. That is 17 points of damage plus Fury of the Small-- --make it 22. Then I'll shoot again! Nope, miss. Yes. Come on! I go get some of the ash off the ground and give it to Mr. Clay and say Maybe you could make some tea with this? There's four balls on this dick. I can help a little, if-- Oh yeah. I don't do well in crowds. Natural 20. [cheering] Oh, thank you. I'll go in there. I'll just run over to Jester and give her a hug and just say Case closed. Us? Maybe? I may have been drunk at the time. [laughter] Well, we used to be-- no, you're right. [laughter] Thank you, Shakäste. Oh, here. I stole a bunch of gold from you last time. [laughter] Thank you. (quickly) You're very handsome. Oh! I'll assist.
