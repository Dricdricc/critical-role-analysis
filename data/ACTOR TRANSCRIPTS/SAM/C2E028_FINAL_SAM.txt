I've been using D&D Beyond for a while now, and they just redid their layout, took me a while to get used to it. For those of you at home using D&D Beyond, I have a couple of tips, pointers, for the new layout, to remind myself where things are layed out. It's like little mnemonics. It's a weird thing. On the right side of the screen, you can remember "L E F," so right sort of like, LEF, left, sort of. That's where loot, equipment and features are. On the left, is "I A A," insight and awareness. I'll put that down here. Then in the middle, is "A T R," which is things you can add to roll. ATR. Right up top is "M S T," which is makes saving throws. That's what you add to make saving throws. That's Sam's little guide to how you can remember the layout of D&D Beyond. And that's it! I watched part of it. It was pretty good, and I might watch it again so I can actually build those characters. I thought you were going to say makes us feel a little uncomfortable. There's no merch, there's nothing merchy? I'm trying to honor the memory of Laura. So me talking right now is just wasting time. Cool, cool cool. They're the worst. Oh yeah. What time is it? Okay. Oh god! It's midday! What do we do? Wait, is is Grudge or Grunge? Can I just say Grunge is better name? Do you think we should go talk one, chat one up? Maybe before we go randomly hiring people what do we need to make this attack? We can probably get in. Also, we're not attacking, right? We're just going to go and try to rescue, or maybe pick off one or two of them, or smoke them out, so that the prisoners, or whatever, have to leave and we can rescue, right? We're not trying to kill everyone in the motherfucking house, right? Well I just want to get our people out. But are we going to hire muscle, or magic, or what are we trying to get? What helps us? Maybe there's a place to buy some potions. Wait. LIAM, ASHLY, MARISHA and We could bring in a lot of kindling. Tip of the spear! It's like, have you ever seen a debate team? They pick one side, and the other, and then they just go at it for a while. They should really start a debate club. You said the sleeping quarters are upstairs. If we went in the dead of night, and I know you have a spell that can lock a door, or shut a door or something? We have some. Did you say ten? Oh wow. Oh. That's a good question. I'll reach in and see what she has. I need my thing? Where's the currency in here? I need it written down! Oh there it is. "LIAM EATS FARTS!" That's right, it's right here. I have a few hundred gold. But then they'll have weapons. Don't say that to her, especially. We have no way of healing ourselves if we die, unless you have healing potions on you. How many do we all have? She has two. Do I have to go to church or anything? Well, we did hear about that weird-- someone said that there's some priest or something, or cleric? Yeah, so we could go see if they could give us-- Or come along? So we can make it tonight. That would be amazing, though. I mean healing potions are nice, but we need someone who can-- we get killed a lot or nearly, you know? You have? They don't belong to any pact, or group that we would need to negotiate with? Is it worth asking a Tasker first? What would we even ask? Just how much it would be to hire you for some muscle? Oh, I thought you meant us, because we're right here. We can hear you. Fjord, probably not. Yasha's probably is okay. Jester has already turned. She's flipped. She's probably flipped. Are we walking or horsing? For the Tonight Show? We can still find a Tasker. No, check your smell bag. See if it passes the smell test. (fart noise) Oh, it's a better name. No, no. No. You cannot argue with someone who talks to a smell bag. Sure. Butt-cheeks clenched. Speed walking. No, we can take the horses. It wouldn't speed us up, but at least we'd be on horses. Nila, you seem to know about the woods. No? Yes, please. How far to the sides does it go? As far as the eye can see? That's sort of cocked. I'll take it anyway. 11 plus nothing. Should we hop the fence? Is there any sign of life? I mean, other than plant life? How do we get over these things? Could we climb them or would we get cut to shreds? You mean the tapestry? That seems very derogatory. Also you're super heavy, though, aren't you? We could try to throw you. No, you can throw me, sure. That's amazing! He's amazing. I'm coming! I'm just going to dash over. That was 12 plus... 19. Is there a door? How big a place is the door place? On the roof or the top of the-- sorry. On the roof or top of the structure, are there any holes or anything? 13. But no windows or anything? Can I go over to the window and take a peek in, stealthily? 12. I'll take a big swig of booze and then go over and try. Why do you have that with you? No! (shouting) Do you know her? Do you know him? (shouting) Do you know him? What's his name? Can we tag along? Do you need any help? He's Mr. Clay. Hello. Hi. Oh, we have to wait? We recently lost one of our friends. We aren't here to bury him. He's already in the ground. We've come to avenge him and we were hoping to find some help in these parts. Do you work here? Is this your place? Do you own this land? Are you the funeral director? It's a graveyard. It's a boneyard. Like a boneyard sort of a place? But you can't bring someone back who's already expired? They've been kidnapped, including a firbolg child. Who are bad guys. We're good guys. Well, we're sort of bad guys, too. Are you a bad guy? What do you grow, other than dead tea? You're stationed here? Are you allowed to leave? No cousins or anything? What's been going wrong? What's that? What's going wrong? So your family is trying to fix that? This is great. So you don't have to check in every night, and be here to punch in and punch out? You could leave whenever you want? A drip-line? We came here seeking help in a mission that we're about to go on. I think so. Do you know Pumat Sol, by any chance? What? All right, then no. No, I just had to ask. What?! Wait, what would we owe you for this? Money? Tea? What? If the thing he needs from us is our blood or something, shouldn't we know that in advance? We should find out what he wants from us before we just blindly agree to this. What if he wants Keg? Some sort of, like, concubine thing? I don't know! What if he's creepy or freaky like that! Really? Wow. What?! (warily) Okay. While we walk. Deuces! It is decided. Where are we going? Back to town, or straight to the-- We don't even know what he does! He's a firbolg, yeah, but... Hey, Mr. Clay? I'm going to shoot Beau with my crossbow. Oh, I missed. (laughter) 12. Sorry, I was just going to test if he could really heal you. I'll shoot again with my bonus action! That's a natural 20. (laughter) Not a sneak attack, because she was looking. Oh boy. That's ten, but it's a crit. Does that do anything? Okay, so that's 12 plus four is 16. Just the tip. Oh, but with this crossbow, when I roll a natural 20, it shoots another one immediately. Do I have to roll for that one? That's a 23 to hit. Eight. First of all, that was cool. And this was cool! Now, do your thing! Do your thing! Okay. You're welcome. Is it on the way? If it's more or less on the way then yeah, we can at least swing by. So we'd have to go through the town just to get there? Into the woods and out of the woods? Are you talking to us? How old are you? But there's four seasons? Or is it three seasons up here? I don't know. He's between 25 and 100. Can I just say, again, I don't give a shit about Ophelia's request or The Gentleman's offer. I just want to get all of our friends and get out. If we can kill them, great, but if our aim is not to kill them it makes this a much easier mission. Yes. Let's swing by the baddies' house and just see what's going on? She sniffs a purse every time she wants to make a decision. No! Terrible idea. How's the half at the house going to do? No. Let's swing by the house and check it out. If there's a raging party, we'll just continue on to town. If it seems dead, maybe we'll do a little recon. If the recon goes well, maybe we'll do a little insertion. The insertion goes well, maybe we go steady. We're just going to watch. We're going to see what it's like at night so if we have to come back tomorrow night, we'll know what to expect. Are there more guards at night? We don't know, they could have six more dudes who come up there at night. We'll just look. What? And then what? They won't leave. We'd need to take one of theirs, take Lorenzo or something. They'd have to come after us. There would be no reason for them to leave. Or maybe not. No, it's good. LIAM and 26. How far? Burch-icide! What?! We can maybe use this. We could make a distraction owl that he will focus on, and we could take him out from afar. Silently, we can kill these two, I think, very easily. As long as you don't move. Can take this guy easily, if-- Do you fight people from afar? How about you, Nila? Do you have anything that can shoot from afar? Well, something that's not like, "Hey, look, we're here, we've got lightning!" Something-- Okay. I mean, that's-- We have Beau. She's quiet. I could distract one while you go up and just (crack). I can shoot one with a crossbow. Okay. Controlled lightning? Well, listen, you can distract him with the actual Frumpkin while I shoot. It doesn't have to be an illusory Frumpkin. I can still shoot. That's true. Phil's the worst. I can, if you guys-- I can shoot. I got a shoot-y thing. I can shoot them. That's loud. We could just do Message. We can send each other a message that's silent. Caleb's in charge. We want to rescue the people who are trapped. Rescue the people in the basement. Phil's friend did. You could take off your armor. Get on different sides of the facility? With two other people. We're splitting up so we can take them both out at the same time. This is inside the wall? Oh jeez. There's a second floor? But it would be ridiculous to have built that also. How are we split up, group-wise? Probably me and Caleb split. And then-- I'll take the new one. Oh hey, look! While we're waiting I've asked the Deuce-- Are you married? Did you go to college? How old are you really? Do you have kids? Well, he's a new friend and I talk when I'm nervous. You're right. Nila is really good at this; she's great. You married? What kids do you have? We'll get ready over here, give us one second. ASHLY and I mean, I can just shoot. If I miss, then backup plan is boost-y to you? You can't shoot anything? Oh! You have a javelin. I guess that's our Plan B, then. Is there anything that either of you can do to hold, silence, or assist me as I shoot this fellow? Let's not do that. Okay. It's fine. It's on me. It's okay. I'll just get super drunk. Message is 120 feet. I take out a piece of wire and send a little Message. Caleb! Provided this plan works, after we knock down the folks, someone on each party should put on their cloak and resume their guard pattern and keep walking around the wall. You can respond-- oh, you did. She's short. Maybe firbolg could hunch over and stalk around. She says to Caleb, who tells me, who tells him. Okay! Oh! Yes! See, you've got a plan, now! We're going to shoot the man and then drunky, smoky Keg is going to pick up The Deuce and he's going to walk around-- We're working on a better one. Other than shoot him again. We have a javelin and that is all we've got. Sure, let's do it! No, I'm still going to shoot and you're going to be ready with jav. You message me a countdown and I'll say it out loud to you. Three, two, one, go! We're shooting at the same time. Are you just sipping tea? You need to stealth too? Yeah. Natural 20. But you said advantage. So that was a three. 24 so far. 24. Nine. Come on! Mr. Deuce, put on this cloak, if you don't mind, and climb up onto there and patrol around, if you don't mind. Mr. Clay! You can put his cloak on right now. Ooh, nice. Mr. Clay! Yeah, give us a minute. I am going to rifle through the dude's pockets and go through the guy we just killed's stuff. 15. 62?! Why is he so rich?! But does he have anything else useful, like keys? Okay, cool. Anything else? Anything else useful? No. Okay, great. Totally useful. Oh! Yes, let's go! Oh, not you. You stay up there. Let's go, but be stealthy. Wait, with advantage? That was the worst. Still not great. No. Oh no! Sure, I'll pick the lock. 16 plus stuff. It's plus four plus three or something like that? Is that right? Yeah, plus seven. So 23. So far, everything's going great-- And we should assume that everything will continue to go great. Caleb, I trust you. Where do we go, back-- Okay, but wait. Can we get Beau and Mr. Clay down here as well to help? Well then, in that case, can you carry Keg? Oh yes, you could use that spell that you used earlier. Recast! Wait, for the duration-- Okay, so we know better. We know you don't have to cast it. Okay, let's go! 23. No, we already went-- You're not with us. What? Here is a laser pointer, Liam O'Brien. Was it Phil and the other guy? Trapdoor to the bottom? Wow, that's the whole layout, Frumpy. Sure glad we chose a spider! Up the stairs? Oh god, why? Why would you do that? Oh boy. What do we do now? Should we go in? Did you see a way to downstairs? Why don't we go try to get down to it? Yes? If the trapdoor is open? Oh, if it's unlocked. Okay, got it. All right. No, just one big swig. Okay, let's go. Got to pick a lock first, or check the door. 24. I will try to pick it. It was 22. That does not work. It was a two plus whatever I said before, seven. I can't do it! Ooh! Push open the door with your massive strength. Can you get us in? Wait, did you cast a spell? Oh, oh wow. Okay, that was easy. All right, focus up. You care about me? Inside-- tickle, right. Nothing, left. Liam eats farts. I'm ready. Got it. LIAM and I cast Mage Hand just in case. I will go through and wait for a tickle. Is there a tickle? I will go straight. I will try the door. I turn right. That's a one! The rogue blew it. 15. Sure. Miss! Miss. Oh Jesus. I will bonus action disengage, and run through the door that the spider told me to go through. The closed one. Locked? Great, I'll go through the other door. Sure, I'll do that. I'll fast pick. Pick fast. 12. Sure. I have any more movement? I will run into the next room, as far as I can get. Wait, did she give me any bonuses? No, right? Did you do your order of the totem thing? Yeah! Is this Phil, or is this his friend? Leave him alive! He must live! These guys are human? These guys are humans? Running past where? Oh, there. Okay. Wait, sees me or doesn't see me? Oh, that's right, they had the weapons. Shit. (synth drums) Oh boy. Me against a barbarian? Has she turned to-- To see me? Okay. Fuck. I will-- Keg is what? Oh, fuck that guy. He's got like two hit points. Fuck that guy. I'm going to try to disable the giant, larger threat than Phil, which probably won't work, but it's worth a shot. I will point at the barbarian and say Oi, I'm thinking of removing my spine because it's only holding me back! I will cast Hideous Laughter on the giant thing. 14. Yes! I took out the barbarian, guys. Oh, she has it? Cool cool cool. Tasha's at the end of its turn, it can make a wisdom saving throw. Hold on. Okay. I'm going to get out of there, run past the laughing thing. As fast as I can. Oh, not that way, the other way. Yeah. Do I try to get her weapon or do I keep running? She's clutching it, still, you said? So it'd be like a strength check. I'm just going to keep running. Another 30 feet. Yeah. Well, because I'm still trying to get where the spider told me to go. Huh? Ah! This guy! Did you see where I went? I think you may get advantage because she's prone. Oh my god. Still advantage on the attack, right? 14. Oh no. But you can still attack one more time, right? Fuck you! Those dice are terrible! Another one? It took six attacks! Yeah! I fire three crossbow bolts. Hey girl! Have you been treating Caleb well? Yeah I think it's around that way? I don't know. (yells) I have free will and I could follow you. Just say, "Follow me." (yells) Thanks. How do you know? Oh, okay. What happened? Disappeared, like was stolen? Don't worry, you have a totally squishy wizard standing behind you. He'll protect you. (laughter) (yells) (yelling) Do you know Pumat Sol? (laughter) Wow. I'm going to try and pick this-- is the door locked? Did we try the door? Did you try the door? Okay, I will Mage Hand pick the lock as a bonus action. Terrible, 13. I know. Action! I will also try to pick the lock. Worse. I know! I don't know what's wrong with me! That's all I can do, right? I can just move. There's nowhere to move, so I'll hang out by the door, maybe try to tuck behind someone bigger than me? Phil? A cleric who likes to heal? This is amazing. (singing) Lady boner! Clang! (laughter) Is that the fly? Ugh! Wisdom saving-- oh, because fire. Wow. Nobody else is coming? Go back to lock-a-pickin'? 15. Yeah. Nila, I need you! Come, quickly! Everyone stand back! Caleb's going to do a thing. (stammering) Get the sword! Ugh! What the fuck is wrong with you? Caleb! I'm sorry I couldn't get it open. I tried, and I made noise, and I should've drunk more, is what I should've done. He's so amazing! Is it open? You want me to check it for traps? All right. I'll go check it for traps. That's a 28. No, 26. There's a trap! Back up everybody, out of the room, and I'll reach my mage hand around. A reach around. Give it a little tuggy with the reach around. Just pull it. Pull it. Just tug it until it explodes. Just reach around and tug it until it explodes. Just keep on working it! Might have to use the other hand for a while, that one's getting tired, Matt! (laughter) What am I rolling? Okay. 22 this time. See? Just easy as that. It's open. Let's go in. Wait, what? No, you had the upstairs built, Matt, you didn't have the downstairs built. That would be too much. Guys? D&D Beyond. We've learned so much about-- Hey Taliesin, welcome back to the show! "New character, who dis?" Aw, that's great! His voice is sexy. Oh, Matt's back! Yasha and Jester, How? They're bad. One's a magic person. Lorenzo. But then you saw some prisoners? Or somewhere. The Trench. We can't close this door that Nila just exploded, but we can put up some sort of person to watch so some of us can go down there and snoop around and maybe kill that one guard that you spotted. Yes. Okay. Any ideas, Mr. Clay? But the gate down there? That was cocked. Fucking Phil. Everybody-- 15. Is this a surprise? Seven plus six, 13, plus-- I've been adding wrong. 18. All the maps! TALIESIN and The gate's open. I'll go with you, Nila. We're not still under the influence of any sort of thing? 11. Kid's dead, let's go home. Let me try to unlock it. (laughing) Wow. While she does that, I'll try to jimmy the bent lock. Yeah, that's a one. (laughing) You ruined the fucking lock! (laughter) I'm going to look around for keys or something. Just around the room. That's a one. 826LA, guys! Wow. Any magic? Yeah, she's quite impressive. Is it already steeped, or is that just the-- Oh, okay. Bye. (groans) We're going to be doing this live next time? Holy moley. You were so great. You were so great, so confident, so much great roleplaying. Amazing. With Matt? Passing the torch. We're still on the TV.
