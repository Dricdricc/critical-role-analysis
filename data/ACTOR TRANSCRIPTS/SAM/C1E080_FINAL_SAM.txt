Big fan of the show? Uh, yeah, tonight's sponsor is Critical Role, as you said, we have lots of stuff. Lots of merchandise available in the store. The logo shirt, mugs, patches, nail wraps, hats, key chains, and necklaces are available and if you didn't see it over the Christmas break, we have the Gilmore shirts and the "How do you want to do this?" shirts and you guys know this, we have a big Spanish speaking fan base, and I wanted to give them some love, so I thought I'd do our ad tonight in Spanish. Two notes, two notes, I don't speak Spanish, and second note is my neighbor's son translated this for me. So, he's in Spanish Two. Should be pretty basic. No, he's-- he's a sophomore in high school. Hola, me llamo Sam Riegel. Aquí está mi perro. Se llama Travis Willingham. Una broma. ¿Te gustan las camisas t-shirt? Espero que sí porque tenemos dos camisas t-shirt para vender en nuestra tienda.

(laughing) I'll move forward and to the left a bit. Sorry, to my right. To the right, four to the right. Oh, man. It's a rough fight. But we're winning, right, now, guys? We're winning, we don't need any help, do we? You wrote a limerick? - For me? To do what? Alright, so I'm gonna do Lightning Bolt. I will-- I assume that Scanlan feels strange with a brass flute touching his lips, because he's never played one before. But does it still come out just as beautiful and pure as always? Okay.

No, I cannot. - Yo no soy Marinado. Alright, that brings us back to Raishan's turn. Maybe you should remind her that we have a deal. We're supposed to be working together. What happened to our deal, Raishan? Ten points of poison? There was a shimmering and you didn't feel anything. Oh, no. That's gonna be-- Forever? Bye. I just got here! (indistinct talking) As she does that, I yell out, "Could you be more specific? Who is next, who? Oh, we didn't see who you were looking at over here. No? Alright, guess we'll find out." One third my size. Here, let me help you. Oh God, I killed him. Oh my God, George, I hugged the puppy really hard. Can I try to counterspell her? 60 feet, am I just there? Eighteen.

I don't-- oh, I'm bronze." Laura. - Oh, what, me? But I didn't do anything. I don't get to save or anything, it just happens? Okay. Does that dispel my fire resistance as well? Okay. You'll have to explain that sometime. That means we don't have advantage on death saves either. Right, wait. - Yeah, we did. Is that gone, okay? 4d8? ♪ Wow. - You healed yourself that much? Jesus, that's a big potion. I'm fine. LAURA (as PIKE) "I am, I don't want to say anything though, but I kind of am. I feel kind of shitty. I--I feel like shit." - "I'm kind of bleeding from my ears, but, whatever." Glad you came! We're happy to see you? How-- how was the flight? We need modeling clay, quick! Radius? It's not gonna heal Raishan, is it? - Well, hey, if you can do six. "Well, I'm behind a dragon, honey, it's okay." Wait, can she do it on herself as well? - Okay. Nine-- nine points? - Decadent. At this point, I feel like you guys are better at Ashley than she is. Oh, oh, shit, I should have been thinking about what I-- Okay. I will-- I will-- I will shoot some stuff at Raishan of it all. I'm gonna shoot Lightning Bolt at Raishan. From my dick. (laughter) Like, yeah, this is happening. Okay, fine, whatever. Okay. Wow. - 17. That is a good roll. It was mostly sixes and fives. Oh.

What about Devo'ssa? - I got a nine, Matthew. - Constitution? - Nine. That makes two of us, friend. I'm at two hit points as well. Did our-- Our bronze brass dragon get hurt at all or no? Yeah, I forgot to tell you, the witch hat is magic. "I have more surprises." "Guys, I think she has more surprises." This has only injured Vax so far, so... Oh, great. Great. She's got some cantrips. Would I be able to counter spell this or-- or am I already in a cloud of smoke and coughing? I'm already in the cloud, right? - Okay. Oh. Backblaze? You're so handsome and charming all of a sudden. Did I-- wait. Vax-y poo, did I give you my cold armor? I mean, Vex-y poo. You're not even using it? I rolled an 11. I'm so dead. Negative 41. The gnomes are down. Well, at least we got Kima. Yeah, whoa, we're down four? Whoa! - Don't worry, Devo'ssa's here to give one shot of 28 points of damage. Come on, Devo'ssa, do something! Oh, wait! Shit. No, that was poison. He shot-- Raishan shot poison at us, right? No, the cold this time. The previous time it was poison. Never acid though. How do you want to do this? - Hey, when she gets back let's all be crying. (snickering) No one said D&D was easy, guys. ♪ Oh! Kima, Percy, Keyleth. It's up to you. - Oh, wait, Grog! I forgot Grog. Start saving shit. To Pike. - She's got no spell slots. Does she have any spell-- higher level spell slots open? This is the last one? Holy shit. ♪ Dragon on dragon. Look at all the notes, look at all the notes. Yeah, I know, I know.

Great. - I lose another death save. - He's got high dex, right? Right? What'd you roll, Laurs? Let's go-- oh. I died as I lived hard. (laughter) I have a plan. It involves me humping a lot of angels in heaven. Does J'Mon get-- - Does that grapple? - J'Mon can chase her. Jarret's still up there. Is Pike down? - Get Pike up. Just moving. It doesn't matter, she's not even gonna get over to anyone to heal them. - She's fine. But no, she's not necessarily fine. You're alive! Nine points. Grog is up. Got any more of those Revivify's? He's calling an Uber because he knows we're gonna kill him after this is done. Four percent, get this man a charger! - Taliesin! Can you run this over to Matt? Give it somebody else. There's a button. No, there's a button. - There's a button, he'll find it. I--I can give it to you. Don't cry. I'm just a little cold. "Just hold me." - Hi. What's going on? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Thanks, thanks. I've got one thing up my sleeve. It's a dog that can run around and help us. That's about it. I don't know, I don't know. What-- there's magic there? I can't do anything about that. No, I don't know what-- Keyleth, do you have a crazy plan? Yes. I don't know that that's true actually. Three hundred feet, 300 feet range. I do. - I could Dimension Door out of here. Yeah, that would just be me. On my turn, I drank a potion. That's it. Should I go? Distract it, do something. What just happened? - What did he just do? How, what did he do? Fucking guy! My voice is my passport. I got single dig going on. I got eight or nine, I can't remember my math. It's pretty bad. Wait, if I had one, plus eight would be nine. Oh, yeah, you do your thing. I--I grab Kima and I say, "Get ready to hit a dragon," and I'm gonna Dimension Door me and Kima to Thordak's body. - There's no Thordak's corpse? - Who was she shooting against? - There's one where you get to do two things. What if you keep rolling eights? Remember, bring your magazines and have Matt and Marisha sign any magazine.
