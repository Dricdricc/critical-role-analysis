I will indeed. Guys, D&D Beyond will be streaming tomorrow, June 15th, live from Origins Game F-- Uh-oh. I've forgotten something in my car. Laura, take over. Buenos noches, I am the masked vigilante named Storro. I fight injustice and defend the innocent in order to send them to the D&D Beyond Store-o. Mine is a dangerous cause, filled with scary monsters, vile beasts, devilish devils. All of them can be found in the various Monster Manuals at the D&D Beyond Store-o. Aha! What is this?! It is a generic tablet device, displaying a handsome array of content and inventory to streamline your tabletop gameplay. Why, this can only be the infamous handiwork of D&D Beyond. With my blade, I cut down on prep time, I slice my physical book collection in half, I slay the enemies of book management? For I am (click click click) Storro! And I will never stop fighting until our D&D Beyond contract expires! And then I will stop fighting! Hyah! Oh boy, guys! What did-- Yeah, you know what? It was right here, it was this thing. Check out twitch.tv/DnDBeyond starting at 1200 pm Eastern time to catch interviews, the monthly D&D Beyond dev update, Q&A, and a live play session with exclusive reveals from Dwarven Forge's upcoming KS6. I don't know what that is! I didn't plan any commercial today, it was just-- You know the thing when you find a mask at home and you're like, "I can do a bit with this!" That's the whole thing. Wait. How can you do that? He's terribly far away. Shouldn't we get out of the swamp first? What if there are scaries around? I think we have one. We can go blow up his house. That seems petty. Yeah, we should blow up his house. Yeah, I guess. Sure. So I'm going to be carrying an explosive device into a troll's house, solo? Just to play troll's advocate here, what if it's not his house? What if we're blowing up an innocent troll's house? Let's go check it out. Okay. 30 feet to the right. Vines. Okay, I'm coming. I will visually inspect it for traps. Nope! Eight. Let's walk around them. What was that? Oh no! That's scarier than wind chimes. Yes. I don't want to, don't make me go in there. It's a troll house. What? Okay. He's got a map. No, what? Semicircle right there? Nott's over there. Kiri, I don't either. Give me the boomstick. I have the boomstick. What am I doing? I'm going to see if this is the troll's place. All right. But Frumpkin's not as-- I mean, yes, that would be great. But Frumpkin's not as stealthy as I am. I'm okay. I have advantage, though. I'm going to run up, stealthily. 22. I'm wearing my Ring of Waterwalking, by the way. I will stealthily back away so there's no way he can see me. To the side, and I will-- Am I able to light the boom-boom stick? I'm looking. (laughter) I have thieves' tools? And I have acid. I don't have a match! What? I'm going to come back! It's definitely the troll. I just need someone to light this for me. Or give me a match. Or something, or light something on fire. Oh, great! Great! Intelligence? Eight plus something. Intelligence check. 11? Okay, I'm going to cast Mage Hand to hold the dynamite. Okay, so Mage Hand is holding the dynamite. Go ahead and light it, Yasha. I am near Yasha. Okay! I'm going to move toward the thing and make Mage Hand go in front of me all the way into the hole. Okay. 25. 35! The mage hand is going in! What did you do? (massive explosion) What? You're going to cut your beautiful work? Should we start bringing cherry bombs? Me? Okay. Double ones. (laughter) On my own blast? 11. We did this to ourselves. Not me, I did my action. 20. 20. Where's that music, Matt? A fjour. Okay, I'll shoot my crossbow and miss, with a nine. Disadvantage? I already missed. Still nine. Oh, I get another one? Oh, that's no good. 13? I will fire once. Am I at disadvantage or anything? Oh, I still missed. 11. Can I scoot back behind that tree to the west? I'll make another one when I get over there. Can I go farther around? Just as far around as I can-- yeah. That one hits. 19 plus something. This is not a sneak attack, though. Well, poo. Six points of damage. Does it at least land where the oil landed? Oh no! It's got a mate! You're going closer? What does that do to it? Is it in melee with good old Fjord? Oh, thank god. I mean, not for you. I'll run up within 30 feet. And fire! Ooh, good, it's a lot! 20-something. Okay, so that's 13 plus four is 17. I forgot about that. Wait, do let it stop me, or don't? I'll cock again and fire again! And it's even more! 20-something to hit. Only six points. I killed something! Wait, what happened? Oh, he was just unpoisoned. Whenever you cure anyone, it feels like a bother. I'll start looking for the gold. The skulls. I'm faster. (laughter) (high-pitched scream) Did you already Cure Wounds? Oh no! Fire also did bad things to it and it didn't regenerate. ` This has suddenly become the most complicated fight we've ever had! Okay. Ahh! (scared, nervous noises) I want to so bad! Am I within 30 feet? I'll get within 30 feet and then hold my action to shoot. I'm holding the attack until it looks like it's safe to do so. Until Fjord's gone. You've got your... Ooh. Maybe I'll just go back and hit it! Oh. Firing. 22 to hit for me. But it's not a sneak attack? (disgustedly) Five points. (laughs) Oh, he's still down. I was going to go to Caleb's aid, but seeing Beau walk away with him, I nod and go back to looking through the skulls for gold. 20 for me. Yeah, any other items that weren't destroyed? What kind of species? I'll take that. Can we keep the dong? I'll give out all the gold. Yeah, so we all get three. We all get three gold pieces. I'm keeping the extras. I don't think so. Kiri, would you like some human jerky? LAURA and What? I thought birds might like that. Well, three times, because the first time he snapped back up himself. Do you still have the crazy eye thing in your stomach? All right, I guess we'll keep going. Oh wait, did they ever come back from their little walk? How are you, Caleb? You faded away there for a second. Are you okay? I think anyone would, really. Oh, you're going to send a message. What's the message? Completed first half of mission? Send money. You can reply to this message. Yeah, there was still more to say. Scatter, scatter! Take to the sewers! It's chaotic. Do you know anywhere in town where they might have that many diamonds? You have it? Ah! We got a real wet troll heart. Smithe Durban is, knows, or has a gimp. (laughter) Yes, I know, right? (laughter) Shadycreek? Was there anyone else here that we were supposed to see, or anything else we were supposed to do? We have to stop by this fungus place to get some potions. The central stables. Hey, Yasha. Yasha, I saw you asking about that book the lady had. Do you want me to get it for you? All right. Maybe place an order or get her attention so I can go snag it real quick. I don't know. I'll cast Mage Hand. As she's filling, I'll Mage Hand back and try to grab the book. Okay, I'll walk over there, then. That's not great. 14. Goo goo ga ga. Do I see where the book is now? (imitating guitar) Damn it! Fjord, what was that? What was that? That's not how you talk to a woman! "Your eyes are like the sea?" We're in a landlocked part of the place here. She doesn't even know what that means. Let's fucking kill her and take the book, take everything in the place! Jester and Molly, you have not tried yet. It's just an extra couple gold. I don't think that we did. Get a lot of healing potions! Oh, are we all going? You want me to come as well? Get a lot of healing potions! Okay. It's riboflavin. Oh, boy. (whispering) Get the manhood thing. What kind of a stone? A big stone? A skipping stone? Do you need it for a spell? If a stone had a ring around it? Kiri, help us look for a stone. I'll look with him. What will you use it for? You know, Caleb, I never told you this before, but when we met that dragon lady-- Carrie? Kaylie? Kali? Cali? That's a lot of K's. She gave me this scroll of Invisibility. I've been hanging onto it, but I didn't know if you wanted to look at it and maybe learn from it, or something? Here, here, yes. I didn't want the others to see it, just in case. Do you want it? Can you learn that now? Great. Also, I'm so sorry that I got you in trouble with Beau for the whole bowl incident. I didn't realize that she was going to freak out on you like that. You took a walk with her. Was that okay? Was it awkward? I think so, too. In her weird, sort of stoic way, she seems to care about you. Do you think she was dropped on her head or something? She's very sort of, you know-- (grunting). You know what I mean? (grunting) Yeah. Yeah, that's true. I'm very good. Yes. Things are looking up and, you know, earlier you said that I could come talk to you whenever I want, and thank you for that. That makes me feel very good. Yeza was his name. The halfling man. Before. That's all. I just wanted to say his name out loud. It's been a while. Yeah. But you got your rock! All right. Let's rock out. She could've learned that from anyone. Anyone with a mildly Zemnian accent. Shut up! Shut up, Kiri! Aw what?! Don't look at-- I'm turning green! Northeast. Wait, we have to go around Hupperdook. There's a ridge line there, right? There's mountains? Silberquel Ridge? We would have to have to go around it-- So we have to go around these mountains. We can either go to the east past Hupperdook. Because we're going to Nogvurot, right, up there? We could go around Hupperdook way, or we could go Rexxentrum way. You've been up there, haven't you, Caleb? But you might know some folks who could help us. What goes on in Hupperdook? Are you making this up? 18. Let's "dook" it up. Okay, let's go. We're going that far-- I've been there, haven't I? Cabazon! We need that! And our money exchange. She's got to hold all the diamonds. We're each going to have a pocket of 300 gold-- I will look for diamonds. Are you talking to the Traveler right now? He's extremely smart. Let's go! The fact that they can't speak. I think he's talking to the cat. No, sometimes when he stares at you and doesn't say anything, he is talking to you, though. So that's a fair question. He only can hear the cat, but he can feel you, so poke him if you feel-- That would be weird. Durian! We also need some warm clothes. Winter's coming. I recognize the color green and white. I disguise myself as a gnome, go in, and buy warm clothes. Okay, done. Caleb, Caleb! They have rambutan, they have lychee, they have jackfruit, they have all sorts of different fruits. They have all kinds! It's a white little-- it's got a big seed, it's white, it's sort of citrus-y, it's really good. You can put it in liquor. They may have tomatillo, I don't know. It's really exotic stuff. Come, come. Do I recognize anyone in any of these tents? It could be a diamond shipment. There was no blazing drum and bass? I don't believe you. (laughs) We are the worst people. (shouts) What are you reading? What are you reading? (laughter) All right, I'll cast Message on one of the kids. I'll say, if you're being kidnapped, you can respond to this message and tell me. That was like a real connection! Okay. I'll cast it again. Where's home? You can respond to this message! There's been a string of kidnappings there in town. Let's continue on. One of us bought warm clothes. (laughter) Yasha and Beau. Beau's just looking at Yasha. They're like the ocean. Me and Caleb. Six. Well, it could just be an animal or something, right? Not yet, let's find out what it is. I'll go look. You stay here and be ready to wake. I'll flank around and try to see if I can see what this thing is. One. Plus ten, but it was a natural one. Get out of my eyeline! Get out of my eyeline, Wil Wheaton! (laughter) You have sunglasses or anything I could wear? (laughter) That's a 12. Queen. Not ours. But that's not where we saw movement? Okay. I will cast Silent Image, and I will make it look like there's just a curious human walking over there. (bad American accent) Hi, I'm an American man! (laughter) It seems like-- yeah? So, Chent goes over there and checks it out. You know, good old Chent. Abercrombie and Fitch top. (laughter) Yeah, he's over there investigating. Nothing? Okay. I will withdraw him if nothing has happened. I didn't-- I take out my wire-- I didn't see anything move. I think it might just be a cart. Okay. I'll wait. He's not a good dancer; he's a white guy. (laughter) Okay. 15 now. Near where Chent was? Oh, shit. No direction? Can I tell from its impact from whence it came? Okay. (panicked breathing) Crossbow attack! Crossbow attack! Wake up everyone! I'll take them out single-handed! I'm going to keep flanking around in the shadows, trying to stay out of trouble. Crossbow at the ready. No, no, not at all. I was trying to flank around. (groans) I will reduce that to three. Did I see where the creature went? Six. Armor class is 16. Okay. I already used my, whatever, reaction, so I'll take the full four. So now I kind of know where they are. But they're hiding. Can I use my action to message them saying, "There's two or three figures behind the cart!" and then I'll hide? Do they see that Chent is now doing the Sprinkler? And kill him. I'm going to fire one crossbow bolt at that guy. Oh, it's only a 13. Eight points of damage. It doesn't feel good, does it? Maybe they can take Kiri. I don't know, we need to get rid of Kiri! Was there anything in the cart? No, right? Horses eat grass. Where are the EDM gnomes? (coughs) That's good water. Yes! Yes! Are there any platform shoes, glowsticks, or pacifiers? All right. 13. Will our whole cart fit on it? Do we have to pay for it? What the hell was that thing he shot in the sky? That is accurate. She's nice. Why? Let's kill her. For sure we do. She's just like us. Where should we stay tonight? Beau is looking for a wild place to not sleep. Gushing Tankard. What was that? Are the Dodgers playing? Fourth Street in Austin. Wait, what? Thank you, Wil Wheaton, for not ruining our lives. Ready Player One was good, everything else bad. (laughter)
