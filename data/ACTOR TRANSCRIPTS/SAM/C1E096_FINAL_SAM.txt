That's too specific. Too specific, she might have gone to a place that wasn't a tannable place. Too specific. Why don't we all make Sportsball without Travis, and just be terrible at talking about sports, and he'll be like, I can't, I can't watch this, I gotta go do it. I have an announcement. We have a fan out there who just got out of surgery. His name is Kurt Shappacher, but in D&D is known as Bork, The Most Eloquent Half-Orc, and I want to wish him a speedy recovery. And I'll kiss his surgical scar if I ever meet him. Depending on where it is on his body. I mean. I was not. Am I to unveil it right now? Can you help me unveil it, people at table one? It is a quilt. Oh my god. It's so big. It's so mighty. It's so many pictures of me! This is everything that I've ever wanted to sleep on. Why are you ripping this thing? Don't tear it! (laughter) It's all posts and artwork of my character-- my former character, Scanlan Shorthalt! (laughter) Wow. We'll find out at the break, we'll find out at the break. We're not gonna waste too much time, here. It's so great. Picture of me, picture of me, another picture of me. I love it. (laughter) There's another thing? Oh, it is a little itty-bitty Doty! And he's got a tiny little book! Oh, he's so cute. The little book actually has little pages. It's so cute. It was a real Heisman trophy. (laughter) If you get a Heisman trophy, will you do Sportsball The Show? What about a Superbowl ring? You heard him, Critters! Go on out and-- for a shitty show? We'll edit this out later. We're taking Pike to Wilhand, I mean. Pike, you want to go see Wilhand, right? Oh! I'll take that as a yes. Simultaneously, but we'll leave just a moment later. What campus tours have you been on? (laughter) Was it "What does JB stand for?" Junior Bacon Cheeseburger. (laughter) That is a great name. You know, 20 years to a gnome is like five for a human. I'm just saying, it could be okay. Is that it? What you have there, Percy, that hat? Birthday hat! Like a goose-step? Goose-stepping? Millennia? That last word? Yeah, yeah! Get to the good shit! The dog run? Taryon Darrington. In Gnome, I say, it's a pleasure to make your a-taint-ance. (laughter) You grew up here? And you seem okay. That's hard to believe. That sounds fun, sleeping outside when you have a perfectly good home to sleep in. All right. I'll have to try it sometime. Taryon Darrington. Yes, it's a pleasure to make your a-cunt-ance. A-cunt-ance. He's an old man. He doesn't lie. Well. It seems to have worked. Whispers. We have nothing to sell. Oh! Those shirts there? Really? That's how she talks at home? Oh, boy. She also owns a bakery. Co-owns a bakery. With the rest of us. And she is one of the finest bakers we have. The best bakers make it up as they go. We don't even have measuring cups, we just kinda pour it all in and shake it up and see what comes out. It literally took five minutes to get here. I made it off of a recipe that she had cultivated, and it's quite-- you'll taste-- I'll just ask him, is there any message you wish to send to Ogden or the rest of the Trickfoots? All right. Okay. Family history, got it. All right. Very good. In Gnome, I say, it has been lovely making your acquaint-anus. (laughter) I'll keep working on it. Taryon Darrington. Not a firm handshake at all. The old apple-in-the-hand? Except your heart. He's combing my hair. 33, 34, 35. Oh, LE Girl. How are you? Well, yes. Unpublished as of yet, as we all know. Budding. Oh. Like a short story or something? I mean, sure, they could write something like that. I would maybe even read it someday. Oh. I am a wonderful writer, but, you know, my story has intrigue and danger and romance-- Seems like a bit of a downer, just a book about a curse, I mean. You know how it's gonna end. Someone's gonna get cursed. What? Oh. Oh! Yes. Yes! Of course. I would be happy to take down her story. Yes, absolutely, if she'll share it with me. We could call it an outline and then Ogden can fill in the details later. The curse only manifests itself in those who bring it upon themselves with greed, or? That seems odd. Unless she's doing things that we don't know about. Well, your narrative was crude and the language not at all descriptive, but I think we have the building blocks to work with here for something that we could turn into, you know, like an essay. An essay of some sort. Not a book, not a book at all, nope. I don't think it would be thick enough for that. A pamphlet, maybe. A big pamphlet. We'll work on it. You've called us together for a reason? Most times, family comes into town, you show them a couple sights-- -- yeah, they leave. This seems like a strange family visit. And avarice. JB said that you would have to bring this curse on yourself. Have you been up to-- be straight with us, we're all on the same team, here. Are you sure you don't have greed in your heart? Lust in your heart? What if we do this what if we go up to the mountain, full moon, go through the motions, and Keyleth, you're super-powerful, you must have some sort of way of telling if this Ogden is telling the truth, right? The other option is-- and I've been holding onto it 'cause it's valuable-- I do happen to have a Potion of Mind Reading, so we could go up there with him and I could just read his mind. That is the smartest thing you've ever said. One. I have one of it. I said that about you. Thank you. Why? You know, it's sinful in a sort of vague way. Google? Maybe we could Google it? I think it's having hate in your heart? I think? What is avarice? Doesn't say. Oh, it's just greed. It's just greed. Yes. Yes! Of course. They'll be easily killed, they're half our size. Percy's very smart. We should all be there together, because stronger in numbers, and if Pike's lying to us we kill her, and if JB's lying to us we kill her. No, if you're infected with evil, we might have to-- I've never used it, so it should probably work great. About a thousand. I can only, I think, investigate one person-- or gnome-- at a time, but then I can move the spell to other people. Let me-- Doty, give me my notes on the spell that I took. Hold on. I can shift my attention to other creatures' thoughts, or go deeper into the same creature's mind. So I can do some surface scans, and then if I get a hit, I can go deeper. Of course, I still defer to you as my teammates. I don't have to be the one who takes this serum. I did pay for it, but if one of you wanted to do the probing, you could buy it off me, I suppose. That's true. It fits. He can't see. I feel like that's a compliment. I was gonna say-- it's four days, right? Well, I think we do it while we're up there. We've got the Musketeers guarding the place. It lasts for one minute. I mean, maybe, but I feel like we wait for the big moment, and then see what's going on in his head. It's more dramatic that way, anyway, for the book. And for our lives. Way to bury the lede, Pike. She's not wearing a wire. She's okay. There's no secrets that you have? No singular secret that you've kept from the entire group the entire time we've known you? There's not some deep secret that you're keeping from us? But then we'll be sitting there for two days. Are we walking, or can we get some horses at least? I'm worried about the big guy. I guess he can just walk. Let me look at Matt's statistics. I could do that. How fast does this cloud thing move? At dawn, we leave. Yes. Yes. For science! I have little potpourri bags in almost everything I own. Yes. Let's do it. Nope, you were gonna gas us all the way there. I'll stay behind as well. I bid you adieu. (laughter) Ugh, gross. They don't know how to break it, do they? Damn it. Three days to kill. Battlemap? Just call it a map, Matt, don't call it a battlemap! Oh my god, what is this? There's color changes happening. It's weird, the blue light makes it almost-- I can't even see what it is. It's okay, we'll figure it out. Matt, in preparation for this ritual, I would like to cast-- can Doty use an item that I cast magic into? Okay. Well, then I'll cast Revivify into one of my coins and give it to Vex and say, use this on me if I fall. Oh, and also, I'll give her my five Needle Arrows that I made. They're just regular arrows that have a +1 to hit. So just a little extra accuracy. You're worth it. I'm just gonna stay where the gnomes are all within 30 feet of me. So close to the action. Within visual 30 feet. Okay. I'm gonna drink the Potion of Mind Reading. Yes. I'm going to scan his surface thoughts, what is most on his mind in that moment. As an action, if it's my turn again, I will attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. He makes a wisdom saving throw. 13. It's not very good. More gibberish. Ugh! Waste of 1,000 bucks. I believe that breaks the spell. It says if I probe deeper, he makes a wisdom saving throw. If he succeeds, the spell ends. And! He's aware I was probing. The plan failed! The plan failed! I know Sylvan, Common, Gnome, Draconic, Undercommon. Another thousand! That don't look good. That's tall. My plan was foolproof. Three. And then got? Oh, jesus. What if it's good? You don't even know if it's a good guy. Where's my pen? SAM and Wait, no damage, it took? Oh shit. Maybe it's not there. But Groggy-poo was. I get an attack of opportunity. (laughter) Oh god. All right. I whip out my String of Beads and I pull off a bead and I will throw it down at the creature's feet, just behind it if possible, so it and only it is in the cube of ten feet. Money! Lots and lots of money. So there's just a big spherical ball there with nothing inside of it? Or does the creature look like it's inside of it? Holy shit. This is an expensive trip. (laughter) Just between us. Not forward, just in a guarding position. He can't do a separate attack, can he? No. Oh, he can? Oh jeez. I'm not used to having these things. Then yes, I'll just have him take a swing at the thing, a bash. He can make two attacks? This guy's awesome! We're friends. Very, I would say. All right, Doty's going to make two attacks, then. Bash and a headbutt. What do I do? I roll something. I roll a natural 20 on bash. That is nine points of damage. And then going in for the headbutt, one. Oh. But still caused damage? What is this magic? You have to be close to it, like you have to hit it with your fists. Everything. Is that four hits north of 25? That would have just straight-up killed me. With advantage! 12. He's literally the worst. What just happened? Trinket just became a ghost. Do it, Travis! (laughs) Draw dick-butts all over it Trinket's a ghost! (gasps) The gnomes are? Kill them! Okay. Play it out. (whispers) They're robbing the bakery right now! To whom? Are JB and Ogden together? Sure. Sure. I'm just gonna break free from Ogden. And I'm going to whip out another bead and throw it right at him. (laughter) It's a dexterity save. 15 Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. Four, one, four, three. Oh shit, I should probably be adding these. That's nine. That's 12. I'll say, Doty! Carry him to the edge of the cliff. The sphere weighs one pound, regardless of what is inside of it. It's ten by ten. I mean, encircled-- Oh, Matt is so fucking good. He's committed to this bit! So you rush over towards him, as Doty's got him maybe ten feet from the edge and now you can see as he's like, "Oh! Pike?" Yeah, he's still in the ball. Doty, just hold him over the edge. What's the play here? What's the game? What were you trying to get? Not that diamond. There's more to it than that. What? You can just do that? Oi! What do you want? I will Identify it. Ooh! That seems useful. Ooh! Thank you! This will help make up for the 3500 gold I spent on this fight! (laughter) Matt is so good! You played us! Every time! We're so stupid! He was rolling every time-- "Oh, "he missed again! Oh! Wow, this guy can't roll real good, can he?" We were so stupid! Oh my God, this guy. I-- How am I getting a "son-of-a-bitch"? He's the son-of-a-bitch! (laughter)
