Wait, can we donate? Not yet. Hi, Scanlan here, hi. Cast? Yeah, I can cast spells. All right, fair enough. Yeah, I guess we should go follow him. Percy, do you have something to say before we go? No, it was bloody, bloody beer. Let's follow him, let's follow him. Sir Greyspine. Lord Greyspine? Mr. Greyspine? Lord Greyspine, yes. Why have you summoned us here? Is it to tell us information about what just came out of your mine, I hope. Money is wonderful. We like money. But we've been charged to find Lady Kima. We need assurances that we will find her or at least some evidence of her in the mines.SAM,  Hieris., LAURA, LAURA It's pretty good. Not great. (laughs) We'll take it. He pulls the ale barrel which you guys provided, sets it on the side of his desk with the same spigot that you had placed in when you presented it earlier and says, "Take a bit." "A bit." You have inspiration dice. All right, there's not accounting for taste. L'chaim! It's Gnomish. You know what, I think we asked about him last time. I will sing a song of rest. And it goes a little something like, ♫ Scanlan make you feel good ♫ ♫ Scanlan make you feel real good ♫ No wait, you get an extra d6 on all your heals. Yeah, we'll go with her. Ooh, god. Like a goblin centipede? (Laura, Liam, Travis laugh) What's a duergar? (clears throat) Hi. (group laughs) I'm really strong for my age. Actually, Hieris, I have a question for you. You know the mines very well, yes? Far from asking you to draw us a map, are there any tunnels or directions that we should avoid or particularly head towards? Anything that we should look for in terms of traps or tricks? That's where we're going, right? We won't avenge him then. I've killed. (group laughs) No, we're good. Back to the tavern. We go back to the Iron Hearth Tavern, right? Is that what it's called? It's like La Vegas, it's always twilight. What happened? Oh yes, yes, yes, yes. We're gonna do what we always do wing it. Okay, so we're going to House Thunderbeards? Thunderbirds? Brand. I wonder what Keyleth is doing. She's squeaking an awful lot. (Marisha imitates squirrel) Going for the handbook. Guys, don't forget to subscribe to Geek and Sundry. What could go wrong? Let's not do that then. Hey, hold on, hold on. Yeah, I can do whatever we want. Do you want me to knock on the door, is that what we're trying to do? Okay, so yes. I send an unseen servant to knock on the door. Where do I create it? Right on the doorknocker. Like, hanging on the doorknocker. ♫ Unseen servant, ho ♫ (group laughs) Yes. We still haven't knocked on the door, correct? I command the unseen servant to (imitates knocking) Oh, the ghost. Hello! I think he knows that. (laughing) Maybe we should listen. He has emotional problems. And we have come to seek your knowledge. You better fucking speak dwarvish. Ya, from Sweden. Oh Keyleth, you've been lying to us this whole time? (Travis laughs) We thought you were a dwarf. Further. I'm gonna have one more try at this. There must be so many arcane things down there that we will discover and bring to you upon finding them. Things that you could use for your research. Historical items. Okay, that's fair. That was great! He gave us a little bit of information. The valve of valva, what's it? Valor of - The place to place to go buy potions. No, the valva-- The Value of Valor! Hey, before we go in there and just make asses of ourselves, As a group, what do you think we need to get down into these mines? Healing potions. Some light sources-- Climbing anything? I have some climbing gear, but-- Oh, what about something for breathing? All right, we go into the House of Vulva. Open your vulva! Oh boy. Any other healing potions to buy? Come on people. Well, do we have ours leftover from what we had before? [LAURA, TRAVIS, MATT] Yes. And do you have anything for adventuring underwater or for helping to breathe in tight spaces? A potion of waterbreathing? How much? Jesus. Take one, two, one? I'm okay as well. You want one, Grog? All right, we'll just take one of those. Well, I don't need it. He doesn't need it. Two. Well, tomorrow is the day that it counts, because that's when we begin to crack some heads. Should we rest and get on with it? Or should we visit some whorehouses? Let's just sleep tonight. Oh yes, one of them battered me quite-- That's me getting beaten up by a whore dwarf. Well, should we go plunder some mines and kill some goblins? Trinket the bear, Trinket the bear. Sure. It's over there. Can you put it so that the people can see? Is that a thing? So let's go down. How many of us can the elevator hold? Okay, let's go. Yeah, let's go down, come on! Any goblin corpse is a good goblin, I say. I'm fine with it. I'll just quickly spit on their bodies as they go by. No no no, no no no. That's being taken to be buried, let's just keep-- Oh. Why don't we just ask the dwarves where they were getting the bodies? Why don't we just ask? Let's go down there. Let's go down where it's dangerous. They're being used like skateboards. (group laughs) Wow, if only we had asked some dwarves what's been going on down here. Great story, Keyleth. And, yeah. Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon. Visitor. (group laughs) No, on the backside. The winner is Yareth. Congratulations. Thank you for subscribing and paying attention and being in the chatroom and being awesome.

Jesus. (laughing) A skittering. Maybe it's a very faint maraca dance of some sort. Because now they don't know where we are. He can just make light again. What are they? ♫ No motherfucker, miss ♫ I start singing using my Cutting Words reaction. To try to distract him. d8? Three. I saved your life! ♫ No motherfucker ♫ Best one of I've had. 19. Oh, shit! Don't worry, I'll help you my dear. I'm gonna take a step back behind Trinket. Actually, wait. How far am I from my furthest-- No, averting my gaze. But how far am I from my-- --my furthest fellow? Oh, I'm 60 feet, okay. And I sing my counter-charm song. ♫ Magic magic, go away, come again another day ♫ So all of us have advantage on saving throws for the charming spells. If they are charming us. I don't know if they are. No, what? Frightened or charmed, it's not the same thing? Okay. Okay. It did not work. Okay. And then as my bonus action, who got hit first? You did? I'll just throw a healing word to him. What is this? Oh, that's a four. Okay. Okay. But I haven't given any. Do your thing. Do what you do. Finally! I don't think it's magic. Thank god. Scanlan. Ride the bear. I will just step forward a little, and I will cast polymorph on our big friend that we're surrounding. And I'll turn him into a snail. Yes. Through the horn of clarity or whatever. So it's 17. Or no, 19, sorry, 19. It's plus two. Don't hurt the snail. Don't pick up the snail. Just be nice to the snail. As a bonus action, I give dice to-- who's coming up next? Who's coming up soon? Percy, you get dice. A d8 for inspiration. No, it's not ready. (group laughs) It's so weak, it's so weak. You got the dice, you got the dice. Yeah, don't step on the snail. She usually picks a bird of some sort. I'm a squirrel and a bird! You should be a rhinoceros. Keep subscribing to Geek & Sundry everybody. We're going for 1200 subscribers tonight, and if we reach that number... good for you. (group laughs) I will. By the way, this music is just great. In Nantucket? And you're in the water! Oh Jesus! Hey wait, he (stutters) he swam away? Hey! Bye-bye! You can move, you can move. Was it? Scanlan? Scanlan's gonna move right in front of where-- I believe that's Percy? Toss another dice to Percy, he seems to need them. And I'm gonna cast lightning bolt at the thing. Who's wet from being in the water, yes? So electricity is gonna be pretty bad on him. Disadvantage. 8d6. 8d6, 8d6. 8d6?! 8?! Shit! (group laughs) Uh, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

Should have created sunglasses for him or something. Oh, yeah. That hits three times. Ooh! I'm right next to him, it might spill on me. Ugh, no! It went in my mouth! (Travis laughs) Ah! (group laughs) Ugh! Ah! What just happened? What's that spell do? You roll, right? Thank you. I think I wanna keep it on. (group laughs) It's a badge of honor. I think I'm gonna keep the blood on me, if you don't mind. Warning to others. Can we take a short rest and heal up? Why don't you let some people heal? Oh God, Grog! Grog, no! Jesus! (group laughs) Oh, no! Krang? Saunter. Okay, I'm gonna move right there into the room as far as I can. Okay. And cast Stinking Cloud right there. (Travis laughs) It's gonna smell like just ass over there. (group laughs) Oh, oh, because that's a big rock in my view there. Okay, so yeah. I'll put it right where you're saying, right there, yeah. (imitates flute) --stinks. (imitates flute) --stink. I'll also take a great heal potion? Is that what they're called? Not moderate. Great, greater, okay. I'll do that by myself. You keep going. Thank you. Oh my God. You can actually do that? Hey Grog. Did you ever write down our underwater spell, potion thingies, whatever those were called? Yeah, did you right it down, though? 'Cause I didn't. The man telling us what we can and can't do. (group laughs) Yeah good. Cop attitude with the DM. The man in charge of our fates. Because of the attitude. Ah, oh. Oh, no. Oh, those aren't good for you. Is that campfire still firing? Oh, the brain's dead. Lisa Loeb? Why? It's weird, Grog weirdly seems smarter now than he was before. Beep boop. You speak Undercommon? Ah, shit. I did not understand them, right? So I don't know that they're going to run. I didn't learn that they're running, so. Can I call out that I heard them? Say, "Don't let them run!" Okay, well. I don't have a good line of sight on them, so I don't even know that they're there really, right? I just hear coughing in the distance. I don't know if that, if it's magic. I have no idea. ♫ Wake up, Grog ♫ It doesn't do it! Damn it! Then as my bonus action, can I still give him an inspiration dice to do on like saving...? Okay, then I give my dice to Vax. Vax, I've just inspired you. (imitates flute) Wait, it's not your turn. I just gave you dice. I thought you said Vax. Okay, sorry. Just go in there, man. Use the dice! Use the dice! A d8. No, it's not an eight. A d8. You gotta roll it. Can we heal him, what is it? What do we need to do? I tried, I tried. Oh! Grog is brain dead. We have to wait a week.
