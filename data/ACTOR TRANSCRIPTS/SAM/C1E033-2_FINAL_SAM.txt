What do I add? I don't know what that is! (laughter) Okay. It's a plus seven! 15. (laughter) That fails. That is successful. Okay. I tried, but he hurt my wrist really bad! I start running out the hall to Ripley. Oh! Persistent cough. Roll for tongue action. Sure, overcompensate. Ripley! We shouldn't yell, Grog. Damn it. We'll get Trinket and go back upstairs, wherever they are. We come back and say, that Ripley is very talented. She got away. Talented Dr. Ripley. Sure, I can look at them. I look at them. Who do they fit? Anything else in the room? Can I sniff around the room and investigate? 12. Vax, do you need my help to unlock it? It does appear to be trapped? Oh, I can open it for you. As in a mansion? He's a good guy. No, he's a bad guy? This is a whole paper trail! We are his blood. And then it says Jarl. Okay? Are they all of the same hand? Is that in the same hand? And is it signed? Riskel Daxio. He built our keep! As soon as I see that, I go down in a crouch and I shit-scry on our keep to see if it's still there. I put a mound of shit in a jar in the kitchen and I told them, don't clean it up. You know. Thursdays. So everything's fine at the keep? At the time, okay. Guys, my shit saw no movement. (laughter) Is that your sister? By the way, this is Grog. Hey, Percival. Any chance you can load up one of Ripley's guns for me? Really? I've seen you use it. You just pull your finger on the finger part and the big boom part goes out. Well, you have to point it at the thing you want to be boomed. I'd like to make an athletics check. Athletics. See if I can spin it around and put it in my pocket. Okay, give it to me. Wait, what's this? Why does it say plus four? Well, it's zero, but it says a big plus four next to it for some reason. It was 14. Okay, now give me a bullet. Yeah! I'm a big boy. Well, I'm a little boy. But I'm a little big boy. I will prevent him from doing that! Is this a skill check? 17! Punch her in the face? Struck her? I could try to tell if she's evil or not. Would that help? You have that? Or you could save that for when one of us becomes a vampire. Am I supposed to punch her in the face now? If they're there. Can I ask Cassandra-- Are the Briarwoods going to be down there? Are they here? They speak of another? Oh, this is the king that will rise again? What? What if it's what? Oh shit. Oh, another question for Cassandra. The duke, Negmeyer? Vegmeyer? Venkman? TALIESIN and Vedmeyer. Have you seen him around the castle today, or recently? Because Grog? He's a goliath. He's a big goliath, so if he's here, you should just, you know-- Oh, when I was a dinosaur and I burned down a house and killed a bunch of people... I wouldn't say fought, because I beat him really easily, and then I ran away. No, I just pushed him off a building, then I thought that was enough for the day, so I went home. Well, thank you. I'll take that as a compliment. Don't worry. Before we cross the precipice into this-- what is it, undercroft? Percival, we all have fought with you this whole time, and you know that we have your back and that we're with you in this 100 percent. But I'd like our enemies to know that, as well, so with your permission, I will cast Seeming on all of us. And I make the girls look like Cassandra, and the boys look like Percy. So I give us all the gray hair. And if possible, I'd like to emblazon the sign of the rebellion on our chests in sort of an awesome Superman glowing thing. A bear with two streaks of white hair. (all laugh) Yeah, with the little glasses. We are all de Rolos today. Possibly confused. Oh, really? Do we all get plus ten? Oh, then 29. Yes, it's me. Yes, it's me, Vax. What do you need? It's me. Sister Vex? Do you mind giving me that gun again? Why, because I'm three feet tall? Let's go. We'll go Percy, Cassandra, Cassandra, Percy, Percy, Percy, Percy, Cassandra. She's lucky Pierre. I guess so. Jesus. 12. The dot? Oh. 11. That was just me? I'm the only arcana-trained person here? Wow. Sorry, guys. Sorry. When they burn the whitestone with the acid or something? You want to burn one? They're open and empty. Ten. Bad deadly ghost mist. A miasma. I was in the back. He's had, like, eight tonight. Go to Vegas! D&D casino? Everyone? (laughs) Yeah! 12? That was your last Luck, too. Wait, this is against charisma? LAURA and Jesus. Wait, we have to fight them? We have to fight them. How is that going to happen? 15. Do you have to roll with advantage? You have-- ugh. No, it's up to us to figure out, right? We're fucked! Check? I read my Scroll of Spirit Guardians. I call them forth to protect us in this moment. Hakuna matata. I don't know how this works. (laughter) (silly voice) They attack bad things around me, and they don't like bad things, so I thought maybe that would be good. (laughter) They attack anything evil within 15 feet of me. Necrotic damage. Good? Good-ish. Sort of devious good. They're both within 15 feet of me, aren't they? When they take their turn, they get 3d8 damage. It's a very confusing spell. Is that now or when they move? I know. Do I get a bonus action? Okay. Who's not undead right now? You? I've already inspired you once. Sure, I'll inspire you again. I've got nothing. This time, I'll just go, (harmonica noises). I do a little doo-wop. (vocalizes) And that's my Cutting Words to try to distract her from her attack. Do I roll now? Two. I have a 17 armor class. Oh, wait! No, that's a ten. That's right. Oh. I shouldn't have even wasted it. You're adorable. Who, me? Oh. Yes. Of course I will. I will do that right now with these d8s that I have. 12. We'll see. Let's do this. I always loved that bear. Hits. Okay. And he takes 3d8. Eight plus nine is 17. 17. No, I just hit you with 17 points of damage. Can I just say, this is Percy beating up Percy right now. (laughter) I walk between Grog and Keyleth, maintaining my 15-foot distance. Even more between. Yeah, and I'll Thunderwave them both. Oh no, and I hit Trinket. (laughter) 19. Eight points of damage. Are we trying to kill our friends, here? That's great. No. From the spirit guardians. Oh, and I'll also inspire Vax. (sings) Rip out someone's tongue and I'll know you. Cure someone dead and I'll show you've got those moves with dagger. You've got those moves with dagger. You've got those-- Okay. 13. Wait! We have Cass. Does she get a turn? Yeah! The old "less likely" trick. You're inspired. That would distract you. You can use your bonus action to throw me the gun! Do I get my radiant damage on him? 21. Do it anyway, Grog! (laughter) She's one of us. Grog, I know you don't know what's going on right now, but kill Keyleth! Oh, you're scary. She's so cute. Jesus. And he's got guns. We are so strong! We should never fight ourselves. Kiss or kill. 50? 62. So you're at 19. What's up, brother? I'm up again? I feel like I just went. All right. We're trying to kill our friends, right? Okay. Thank you for moving, Vax. I'm going to blast them both with lightning. Straight shot through, 100 feet. Yeah. What do I do? 8d6? 24. And as a bonus action, I'll do a Healing Word on Vex. Right? You're injured badly? Oh, well then fuck it. Oh, you're injured badly? Would I know that? Okay. Yeah, so I'll Healing Word. What is it? Shit. It's right here d4 plus five. That's it?! So lame. Seven points. Ooh, yes. Oh, this is going to knock you out. That's nine already. Six more is 15. That was Donald Duck, right? Oh shit! Hold our wrath. I vault over Keyleth-- I vault over Keyleth's body, using the right part of a buttcheek to launch off. Grab a little feel as I go. I try to get within 15 feet of the thing. And as my first thing, I will Healing Word Mr. Taliesin Jaffe. Percival de Rolo de Monico de Chico... Just at normal level, so that's nine points. Jesus. I don't want to burn another fucking thing on this guy. I know, but that's when he moves, not when I move, so I will mock him! I will say, you're not even corporeal. You have no substance. You're a nothing. You're a nobody! You won't amount to nothing in this world! (laughter) 19. Six. (giggles) I would like it to cry. That's all. You were nothing in life, and now you're nothing in death! I'm sorry, I didn't mean it! The one who possessed you! Wait, is Keyleth alive? Oh Jesus! Keyleth, I'm sorry. I will sing a song of rest, which will give us 1d8 for everybody. I don't know. It just says 1d8. It's my song of rest. (singing) You're down with more HP. Yeah, you know me! Just one extra d8. Do I roll that, or do they? Holy ba-Jesus, guys. Can we never do that again? Making camp? We're in a tomb with ghosts. We have to continue on. Yeah, aye. Let's continue. Into the tunnel. Into the dark. Wait! Sorry. Percival, any point in looting? Sorry! Forget I mentioned it. Let's go kick some ass. No, by each other. So the Christmas Critmas is going to be the 3rd. Does the DM get a playlist? Happy Thanksgiving.
