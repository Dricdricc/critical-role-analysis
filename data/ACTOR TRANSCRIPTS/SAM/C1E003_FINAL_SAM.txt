Oh hi, I am Sam Riegel. I play Scanlan Shorthalt, the level nine bard gnome, who is the handsomest and most charming of the group. (all laugh) Scanlan Shorthalt. Ranger! And I'll be playing at the Laugh Barn in St. Louis. (all laugh) Three. Three nights. Three nights sold out. Opening for Carrot Top. Grog! Grog, can you hear us? Can you feel us near you? Nothing. Nothing. Someone, quick! Draw a dick on his face! Ooh, investigation check? Excellent assessment, Tiberius. A shorter way of saying the same thing. It happens, it's natural. Poo. Poo cloud. Well, we'll need to form a perimeter and someone will have to stand guard-- Oh, we gotta interrogate. It. How close to death's door is she? Chat room? Chat room bought us a pizza? All right, all right. This creature is very injured. I think we need to heal her just enough-- Just enough. Why don't you make that bargain then-- You can't understand her. Only she can. No, is that a thing? Is that a person? What is K'varn? (gasps) Can I tell if she's lying? Is it-- Insight check? Oop. No. (laughs) Ugh! That was very fast. We need to-- Let's rest. Let's set up a perimeter and take turns standing guard. I'm going to go to the next cavern over to where we killed those umber hulks? Take one of the umber hulk heads and put it on a stick. Right out front of where we're-- Of where we're camping as sort of a warning to others. What are you casting? What are you about to cast? Oh. Great. Well, before you do that, hold on. Let's look at it. (laughs) Can I take a look at it and-- History or-- or arcane? Arcana. No! (laughs) Ooh! Nothing. It sends out magic missiles! Basically it shoots out six missiles and then it-- Yes, as a warning to others. Yes. Where was that symbol? I'll come with Tiberius as well. Okay. Not sure if he's still breathing? It's a good thing? Well that must be why Lady Kima came down here. Grog's probably farting again. All right. Let's quietly wake them, and I will go peer into the darkness and see if I can see them. Is the rumbling continuous, or is it just one little rumble? Oh, okay. Oh, easy! Like the flower, the flower trick? Something terrible is brewing. How is everyone feeling? Do we need to heal? Everyone? No, what about us? How are we feeling? Are we okay? Are you gonna cast a spell now? Okay, I'd like to give her a little inspirational song. Okay, some, like, yoga music? (sings) You know you got to cure Grog. I do have my idol of Pike, yes! Oh, of course! I take out the idol of Pike that I keep always close to my loins, and I hold it tightly, and warmly-- -- and caress it a little. You know, I know Grog very well, and he might enjoy, or be inspired by, a kiss of a female. I'm just saying, just the gentle kiss of a female lips on his might rouse him. I've seen it many times. Vex? Get in there! Get in there! (all laugh) d20. Let's do this, man. For the chat room. (laughs) You're alive! I don't even know what that means. Question or the answer. Hey. How is he doing, how is he feeling? Grog, how are you feeling? How is he feeling? Right where it should be. How many fingers is this? Perfect. It's true, it was quite astounding. I have a little chub on. Let's do some Grog healing. You don't have your healing dice, right? I'm gonna sing a song of rest for you, so that'll add 1d6 to your healing rolls. Shall we tarry on, everyone? Tiberius, hit us. Light Let's burn it down. And we can send and receive messages or just receive? Is it like a Madonna microphone? We've come back. You sauntered up. Should we rejoin our fellows? Traipsing, we traipse up. What's going on, guys? As long as they are sucking it out of goblins, I'm good with that. How long do they last? No one's going to take down our intelligence, we're too strong and we're too awesome. Or festive. I have a whip! And a forgery kit. (all laugh) Yes, just be cautious, that's all we can do. VAX and What do you want to do, you want go back? +2 enchantment? So wait, does he get a bigger or higher AC? What is that? Wow, that's huge! I'll take it. I'll give you all dice before we go in. While the DM looks this up, everyone, subscribe to the Geek and Sundry twitch channel! Support the show, support the channel. And keep sending us food. (all laugh) And more presents. No more food. All right, shall we keep on keeping on? Huh? 20. (whispers) Grog rolled a six. We have to save those ones. No, no! If we follow them on the bridge, won't they feel it bouncing? We can't see the end of it. Just you? You're gonna go on the carpet alone? What if something happens? I'm coming with you. Shotgun. Let's go above them. Not great. 13. Way down below. We don't want to fall. The view up here is beautiful! Is the range? How are-- We'll update you soon. They'll probably see us. Tunnel. Okay, listen. Leave me behind, I'll follow the party with the hostages, I'll see where they go. Don't worry, I'll be invisible. Go back, tell our fellows, get them across the bridge, and we'll meet here in about an hour. What? I'm super brave and hung, come on, let's do this. (all laugh) I turn invisible. And I'm gonna just hang behind the party that's got the hostage dwarves, and just kinda see where they go. Don't have to activate. It's passive. Yeah but I might make-- I might snap twigs. Ding-a-ling-a-ling! Got it. 16. 18! Ooh! They're slave trolls! White eyes? Okay. Gah. 19. Do I speak their language? Nope! Then, no thank you. (laughs) The captives? Okay. (apprehensive sound) Whoa. I'm wearing my ring of mind-shielding, by the way. Poor son of a bitch. Worst show ever. Okay. That was one of the captives. Do I see where the other captives were taken? Okay. I assume bad things are happening in there, I don't need to see it, right? I think I'll just kind of-- is there anything-- No, oh, no, do I? What do I speak? Where does it say? Shit. I play a shawm. No, I just speak Common and Gnome. Okay. I think I'll go back to my fellows. There's nothing I can see-- that door doesn't lock-- does it lock by any chance? Open tent. There's nothing lying around, none of that black armor lying around or anything? Any extra things -- Okay, I think I will just make back for my friends, then. With advantage? 21. Survival check, so plus zero. 17. It's like Venice. Whoa. I am going to tell you everything that just happened, in detail, in real time. (all laugh) And that's when I came back to see you guys. (all laugh) Thank you. What is that? He was tall, I mean everyone looks 20 feet tall to me, I'm a gnome. He was bigger than you by a little? He carried himself big. He was lanky. Several? No sign of Lady Kima at all, just a bunch of dwarves being held against their will, and then one by one being brain sucked by Mr. Lanky Man. Two big trolls, and ogres, don't forget ogres, there's ogres too. Yes, there were two big ogres as well. And duergar aplenty-- maybe four dozen or so, three dozen? Wandering. Yes. There's a volcano? Oh the lava, down below? Do they know the address here? That's kinda creepy. Thanks chat room! An illithid? And have them all jump over the edge of the cliff? The one lengthy creature was levitating. Well yes, but I think what Grog is talking about is the bulk of the fighting force, getting them to follow us over the bridge and then cutting the bridge. That's a good idea. Do you want the rope? No, we want to drop the bridge and have them fall to their deaths. Yes? Well, they would run willy-nilly! Well remember, there's a tunnel on the other side of camp. They could run that way as well. 20 feet. You can get a lot of them on that bridge and then cut it. I like that idea. It's up to the deck, or it's up to you? So, what if it's a scary thing that scares them away? That might not be a thing anymore. Why do we need to float Grog? Oh. Wait, wait, wait. Are we-- Let's also recap which plan we're going with. One of us creating a diversion and running away, or these mystical, magical-- -- weird dragon creatures. What if they scare them the other way? What if-- Also, might I remind-- We're luring them. And also, might I remind you all, that they're being mind controlled by this, what, illithid-- And if the illithid recognizes that your-- -- your things are false, then he's not going to send his men-- -- off to chase them. However, if we were-- hm. What? To sneak through the village to the tunnel? No! Not all seven of us. And a bear. Are you crazy? (all laugh) Wait, are we doing his bait or are we doing a real bait? It's fake. It's just a hologram. Oh, snap. Other terrain or an animal? Can you make the chasm look like it's solid ground? Can she do this? Yes! Is gonna see through that. Wait. Wait! Might I interject? I'm so sorry. You guys-- You and you will be hauling ass away from the charging horde-- On our side. So, when you get all the way to the other side of the bridge, then we're gonna chop. Which side are we gonna chop it on? Our side or their side? Okay. Rope. I'm also going to sing a little song-- -- for both of them-- -- to inspire them. Oh, yes, I'll sing an inspiration song for both of them. (sings) Hey baby, hey baby, hey! (sings) Dwarves say. Dwarves say. (all laugh) Oh, I'm sorry, these two-- Grog and Vax. Oh! Are you going too? I'm sorry. Tiberius and Vax, then. We're gonna stay on the side that doesn't have all the bad guys on it. You got your dice? Use your dice. Cut the rope, cut the rope. Leave Vax there, let's go. (all laugh) Oh yes, that's even better! -- fake ground. The troll? This was a great plan! (gasps) Oh shit. (whispers) You, fly? Oh shit! Plus eight. That was our ticket across the chasm. You can see them and they control you. Material? It's the carpet! Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, watch out for that warm air, whatever that was. It's water? I thought there was lava-- So there, it's a river-- Place to go explore? Well, we could go to the camp and go kick some-- But we have a carpet now! The three of us can fly. I'm all for going-- There's a tunnel back there-- -- back, past that village, that they're protecting. Lava tunnels? What, are you crazy? Sorry, yes? (yells) So here's my thoughts. Yeah, so, I don't wanna go down there-- -- there's things pulling trolls. Yeah, let's not go down there where there's things eating trolls! Why don't we just-- Yeah! Why? Why do we have to go down there, there's nothing that we need down there! There's seven of us and one of us is Grog! Deep into the tunnels. We can try-- But what is down there? But there's no sign of anything intelligent down there, other than something that's eating trolls underwater. It could be just giant whales down there! We have no idea! There's no sign of humans at all! It's lava and death animals! How're you gonna go in the tunnels? There's lava! If you burn-- Tracks in a river? It's not that kind of a tunnel! There's water flowing in it! Can't go in there. Oh, so there's a cavern opening? Can't go in there. There's water pouring out of it! But what would we find in a tunnel with water pouring out of it? It's not like anything lives up there! All right. All in favor of going to the duergar village and facing the giant fucker. Or up and over. Or at least getting past it. That direction. That's four of us. All in favor of going into the lava flows, to find something. Mm. Mm. Are you a communist? (all laugh) Wait, you're stealing our flying carpet? (all laugh) Meanwhile, back up top, I'm saying, they're not gonna find anything. They're not gonna find any tunnels. (all laugh) (laughs) They're not gonna find anything. Can he fit on the carpet? That is the thing I saw in the village! He's a friend? Help-- Ally. Ally. If we find this creature, we might be able to free your hive as well. 13. You're a people person! What's his name? Can we just call him Clarence? (all laugh) And as a symbol of our dedication to you, I'd love to play you just a little bit of a song that might heal some of those wounds and scrapes that you seem to have all over your body. It's a pretty good song! Hm. Ooh! 17. (all laugh) (sings) When I get that feeling, I want Clarota healing. Clarota healing is something that's good for you. Ooh ooh ooh. (sings embellished melisma) A performance check! 18! There's many more where that came from! Yes! End scene!
