Where we play Dungeons & Dragons! To plug our good friends at D&D Beyond, I need my fellow castmates to help me. Can we practice? Can you all say, "Boo"? Can you all say, "Yay"? Okay, the official digital toolset for Critical Role is D&D Beyond. A great service to organize everything D&D. Rules, spells, character sheets, and more, all with a pesky pen and paper? No! You can access it digitally on your computer, mobile, or tablet. The cast is using D&D Beyond every week, except for Taliesin. Just kidding, he is! I have to use both the boo and the yay or else it doesn't make sense. He can do cool stuff like activate Critical Role content in his character builder and create a blood hunter. And do you think they charge an arm and a leg? No, they don't! D&D Beyond is offering a discount of $10 off any digital book in their shop. Use code "beginnings" at checkout. So check them out at dndbeyond.com. Is that D and D Beyond? No, is that D-N-D Beyond? And this spot was written by Sam Riegel. Or dorky eight-year-olds or teenagers. Calgary is like the Kentucky of Canada. I don't know. So we're still at the carnival? Are we going with them or not? Should we stay here? This is not our affair, right? Well, you sent the kitty, didn't you? Follow behind a bit? Okay. Sounds good. And he can't communicate to me either so-- Yes. But you can talk? Got it. Okay. Great. Sure. Wait, did we just all ditch Marisha? Beast Shape! (laughter) We never get to make those! Kill them all. In an effort not to go to jail, you went to the jail. Kill them all. Make all kinds of rolls. This is a terrible idea. Right away. Spasm shaming. Use it. Oh, what? Little sister? What? Hi. Now? Why? Get some booze, got some books, find a little taste of civilization, maybe some better food. Oh, yes, very good. I know everyone else makes fun of your smell, but I don't smell nothing. Under sort of holding arrest or something? We can't leave the city. But I was thinking about this. The people we met down there and spent the day with they are lunatics, but they draw a lot of attention to themselves, leaving us free to sort of slink back into the shadows a little bit. It might be sort of the perfect camouflage. No one's going to be looking for a little goblin girl anymore, because they'll be looking at the crazy people, the tieflings running around smashing shit. Well, let's give it a day and if things seem a little bit, you know, skinky-doodie tomorrow, we can fritter away in the middle of the day or something. But we need to replenish the healing potion you used. If we don't have that, then what happens the next you get in trouble? All right, but how on earth are we-- all right. We can cool it with the cons for a couple of days. But I can't promise that I won't get the itch again. All right. No! I didn't do nothing, we just went to a show. It was a pretty good show. Up until, you know, the dead people part. Yeah! Well, we'll lay low. Should we pretend that we're still friends with these people? Don't worry! I'll turn on the charm. Thank gods. Oh, thank God you're here and safe! We missed you! Somehow we got separated! Friends. I'm lying! (laughter) Two, please. Hi Frumpy, nice to see you again. We're just a couple of friends, strolling around the countryside looking for adventure. We have a string of bad luck. We tend to get in trouble in places for various reasons. Some of which is my fault. Most of which is my fault. I have sticky fingers. I can't help myself sometimes. I'm fascinated by little bobbles and fancy pieces of jewelries and I love trinkets so much! I just have to take them, and have them with me, and put them in my pockets. It's gotten us in a few scrapes a couple times. Caleb, he is fantastic. Very patient with me, understands. But really it's my fault; it's not him. He's a smart man, a brilliant magician! Have you seen? Some of his tricks are phenomenal, really. I feel bad to because we never stay in one place long enough for him to have a decent shower. (laughter) Anyway, that's the long and short of it. Well the nice ones I keep. I have a little-- I collect a lot of things, but in the last place we hunkered down, it was all taken from me. We were in one of those prisons before-- Am I sharing too much? I'm sharing too much, aren't I? We were in a prison, they took all of our belongings. I lost all of my collections. I had a lovely rock collection. I had a rare coin collection. I had a stick collection. Yeah, it's all gone now. I love them. I just don't have any right now. True. But they were like people's canes and things. (laughter) You know those rocks that humans wear on their fingers and around their necks and stuff. They're really nice rocks. Oh I don't care about the people who have them. I just like pretty things. Toys, anything really. Okay! Can you help with that? No, it's the collecting. Well, would you like a demonstration? Sure! That'll make it really easy. Are they closed? All right. Out of practice here. I'm going to do a shot. Crack my knuckles. He'll be pissed? What? He? What's on your waist? Oh. All right, I'll go to her left buttcheek pocket and fish around. What pockets do you have? I'll do the hip pocket. Three. (laughter) Plus eight. This is not how it usually works! The person is not really expecting it. This is embarrassing, really. I have the one skill and I failed at it. Yes, I know the trick. Takes a little bit of time, doesn't it? Okay. (clears throat) I do know one piece of magic. Feast your eyes-- Fibulous! It will turn into a silver piece. Only I can say it. (laughter) No, it only works up. Well, no, we weren't giving you the silver piece just showing you a bit of magic. This pot is actually quite powerful. It can do that once a day, so if you'd like to purchase it. Well, it only works once a day. I think it only does the copper to silver? Yes, it's a mild magic pot. But if you'd like to purchase it from us, we can sell it to you for five gold. At discount for friends, three gold. And for that, we'll teach you your own magic word. You can do it once a day forever, you have it for the rest of your life. But this is free money, that you don't have to work for. All right, one gold. It's a pleasure doing business with you. Does that answer your question? I've got some for you. Yeah! How does someone like you -- you're human right? How do you come by learning Halfling? Everyone likes wine! What town was that then? Hmm, haven't heard of it. Nothing shady there! Absolutely! I put my hands and feet out in an akimbo pose. I feel it coming! Hit me! (sings) Thank you! Where did you come from then? It's past midnight! Natural 12! Is that good? What? Who? What? What's going on? Were Caleb and I not instructed not to leave the tavern? We received no formal instruction. How'd you get in? The fork trick wasn't very fun, was it? The monster attack? I can use the Long Rest feature of D&D Beyond! Whoa, nothing changed! No spells. I lost ten hit points?! What the fuck?! I've done something terribly wrong. (laughter) We'll work on this during the break. She's a morning person too? Jesus. Get some breakfast, I guess? (messy eating noises) (growls) Sure, for you. We weren't told that. But I can change my appearance. Yeah. What does that mean? What are we doing again? So we solve the case to clear our own name. If we solve the case we would be absolved. It's not a terrible plan. Listen, we've all had a rough night. I know that my features aren't necessarily the most feminine. Among goblin kind, I understand. It's hard to tell. You really have to sell it though, and act like a dude. Oh yes! Angelina. Excellent. Well it's just that-- listen, there's no offense, I enjoy our talks and your schooling and everything, but I haven't talked this openly and freely with other people in months. It's amazing. Yes! We're the first ones out the door. Yeah. They'll never know who we were. Well, don't say that too much. I mean, yes, they do know that we're Caleb and Nott, yes. Okay. Yeah, let's just go with, and see where it leads. Hi! Yes, we weren't talking! Oh! What are you? I'm sorry, I'm just a young girl from the village. I don't know anything. I should go get my father. But you look like-- Are you afraid you'll be propositioned on the street? Those lips are very big. What is that? What does that do? Oh, the stealthy thing, yes, thank you so much, I'll accept it. Is that three for the night? Oh my god. You can come with us, if you like. It's quickly becoming canon that you just have shit smeared all over you. You could travel with me! I could be your daughter. Yes! We're a couple, and he's our guard or something, I don't know. I'm sorry, she's very forward. Yes, mommy! There were the snakes in the circus last night, but it wasn't related to the attack, I suppose. And this fellow who died worked with the fishermen in the lake? Is the lake within the city limits? Two please. What labor was he doing? Down at the docks? Your lady voice is worse than mine. You read! I take out my flask from my leg, unscrew it, and pour it in. Was it? That sounds terrible. This is exciting. Gripping. Your game is really suffering. Wait. None of you look the same. What? What? You said you hadn't seen this-- hi. You said you hadn't seen this person in a week? Was that unusual? What? For what? Oh yes, that's right. Ooh, don't do those much either. We are the best detectives ever. We didn't leave any sort of Ferris Bueller-y thing? Is there anywhere else that we need to inspect? The carnival or more docks stuff? Where he was last seen. But he's not trying to investigate! We are really terrible at this! Continue the investigation? Or go back? Yeah, yeah, We'll be a regular-- All right. Were we just on the docks? Okay, we'll walk around the docks and look for-- All right. Sure, that sounds like a good idea. All right, I'll jump on Caleb's back. Shall I help, or no? Sure! And no one's coming to the door? Want me to break in? I start unscrewing my flask. (laughing) Can you give me something to look for? To distract me and give me a mission to go on, please? All right. I rolled a 21 investigation check. I'm just looking for baubles to steal. (laughter) It's like the adult section for him. Have I heard all of this conversation? All right. I'll try to trade my flask with that flask. 22! Wait. More. No, that's right. 22. Shit! Okay! It's a baby bottle, or maybe a rattle? What'd you say? I know. But I can't resist. I'll try to take one more look and pocket that as well. 20. Are we going to leave now? Should we leave? I think we should leave. Maybe we should go. Do you need some money? I could lend you some money, if you want. All right. Lovely place you got here! Yes, please! I will! I'm sorry! I did it again, I couldn't help it. I took some things. Do you think he noticed? Do you think we're in trouble? Maybe we should hurry back. All right. Are you cross with me? Okay. I heard you talking about money, by the way, I could lend you some, if you'd like. Let's do it. I guess we do. Well. That was terrible. No one found out anything. It was a waste of a day. We're all terrible at this. Goodnight? That is nonsense. Hey, Dungeon Master? The other night, when Nott was out carousing a bit while Caleb was asleep. He saw some figures in cloaks dash by. Was there any distinctive anything about these three figures that dashed by? Damn it. Okay, I will share that information with the group. I saw some weirdos running around. The other night, when he was asleep. Two in the morning? Sorry. I had gone out to do some window shopping. Yes, I wasn't very successful. I had walked by the general store-- I passed by a place called Natural Remedies, herbs and medicinal things. I went by a spot named Jackalwere, it's a smithy. It was between-- I don't remember. I think that was what it was called. We could do a little stakeout! Probably by foot or by horse, right? Yeah! Yeah, he has a magical spell that alerts you when someone tries to break in your room. Best part is, it doesn't alert him when I sneak in or out. Wait. What? Ooh! See, he's really good. Yeah, I'll go to where I saw the three cloaked figures. Stealth check. Do I still have the blessing? No, I don't. 21. 42. Should we fan out a bit? Cover a couple corners, so we can still see each other? Are you two like an item? You and Fjord, are you like a thing? No, ugh, no! You travel together. Not at all like that, but yes, all right. 19. Mediation check. Toya? Let's go wake her ass up. Yeah, let's go wake her ass up. Hang back close by though, right? If something goes bad-- So we can go to the circus? Tagging? That's good. Let's move then. Some are staying away from the tent. 13. 13. Is there only one guard? Anywhere to hide? I will take off my mask and start attacking Caleb in a convincing fashion. Not to draw blood but-- yeah. Deception check? Oh. (snarling noises) Oh, my deception check was a three minus three. At advantage? Seven minus three! Oh god! Sure. Miss! Oh! (spits) We've practiced this before. We got this routine down. Ugh. (snivels) She's taking a shit. No, I'm fine that was good acting. You were perfect. I panicked, I didn't know what to do. I was trying to create some sort of distraction. They're all over the place. (laughter) Sure, but will you be watching me or no? You don't have to. All right. I'll go with you and-- who else is going? Are you stealthy? The girls and the boys. And whatever Molly is. (laughter) Yes. Yes. I'm with the girls. You designed a character with no pockets?! Why would you do that? 25. Shouldn't we just go to the Toya tent? Look over here! We come in. They don't like you? Why? Why? What did you do? Hmm. On? Does it follow her? That's pretty cool, let's keep going then. Maybe we'll see something? We're going with, but before we leave I'll ask Desmond From one outcast to another, are there any questions that are bugging you about all this? Well, thank you. (mimics bird call poorly) That's how they talk to each other. That's how carnival folk talk to each other. 21. Uh oh. Who did this? What was it? I'll go with her. No problem. 23. Oh god. I'm just tucking around, getting ready. I don't see this? Oh boy. No, it's like 13 or something. We found something! Go in? But if it's bad, that's bad. Oh god, will we have to fight a dead thing? Should we get some help? I turn to Caleb's cat and I say go! Go get Caleb! Shoo! (hiss) Go away! (hiss) I can't speak Cat! Go away! Go away! Go tell Caleb we're here! Okay, I've sent for help. All right, let's go. No. It's a different one. That's why you detected him, because he's a fiend. I don't know, you detected-- We can wake him up and ask? Yeah? LAURA and Is anyone else in the tent? One. This looks really big and scary. We should talk to her, but if we wake her up he's going to be mad. I guess we have no choice, we should talk to her. She's a dwarf? Do you speak Dwarvish? Maybe she speaks Common. We'll be fine. She's a circus person. Let's wake her up! Toya. Singing dwarf. Put down my hair. Wakey wakey! We should light a light or something? Otherwise we're just in the dark. Sorry to disturb your slumber. Do you recognize us from the other night? Last night? Last night? Has it happened before, or was that-- Was that the same song you always sing? Did it feel the same coming out of you or was it different? When you were singing, did you hear any other sounds or words that someone else was saying? Has anyone new come around and talked to you? Asked you to do anything? It's so strange. No, we're really good. And yesterday before the show you didn't notice anything weird, anyone creeping around the carnival, setting up anything? Snooping around? Cloaks, cloaks! Is there anyone you think would want to destroy the carnival or hurt Gustav? Does Gustav have any enemies? Him and Ornna? It's Ornna! Ornna's the one. Thanks very much, we're out of here. (laughter) We're stealthing over to that tent, by the way. The one with Ornna in it. Oh, you want to swoop by the main tent? I'm fine. 22. Any evil? Goddamn it. It's Ornna! We know who it is! We know who the killer is! Ornna, you have a lot of explaining to do! You have a lot of explaining to do! We've talked to Toya. She knows it's you who did this! You're the one behind the whole plot! You did it! Who do you work for! They've got Nazi in their name! Knot seesters. Guys, I don't know about you. But my stats are so neat because of D&D Beyond tonight. No, I know right now I've got 14 of 15 hit points. Start talking, or this gnome-- nope! Goblin! Starts biting. It's Desmond. Let's go to his tent! It's the lizard man! We're cracking this case wide open. Are we in the same tent or are we in two different tents? Bastard! Can I just say, Laura and I busted the case wide open! (laughter) We solved the case. Easy. Couple inquisitions. Couple little, uh-- Following the clues.
