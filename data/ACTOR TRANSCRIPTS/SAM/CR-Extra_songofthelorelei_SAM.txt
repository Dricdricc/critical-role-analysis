Live show! Laura has the wrong iPad! I mean, or tablet device. Can you find out how our characters-- Why don't we just make this two hours of us going through Matt's iPad? Yes, we should. Everybody, as many of you already know, obviously, a few days ago we launched a charity campaign with Blair Herter and the Pablove Foundation, which is devoted to ending childhood cancer. We're specifically trying to raise money for a 600 mile bike ride that Blair and his brother are riding from San Francisco to LA, and we had all these lofty goals for raising money for this ride. We said that if we hit $20,000, that I would run a one shot. Passed it. We said if we hit $50,000, of money raised for this amazing charity from you, the Critters, that we would be able to fully fund a research grant to try and end cancer. We hit it, you guys are incredible. $50,000 raised for this campaign. It's incredible. So incredible that we're scrambling to add other stretch goals! So we just got one in, it's hot off the presses. If we hit $100,000, which is crazy, but also possible, we will be able to fund the Shutterbugs Summer Camp. An entire summer camp where they teach photography to kids fighting cancer. You could make a kid's summer camp dreams come true with your donations! So there'll be more information in the stream or whatever. Down here, up here, all around, social medias. So click donate, be awesome, and thank you so much for all your generosity so far. It's really making a difference, and you guys are incredible. (applause) What? It's DiceGirl6969. Wait, stuff from Gen Con that was previously unavailable? The dad hats? They're real cool Sure. Tickets are on sale, or will be. Yeah, there's music. Bro. Larry. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Fire bad. Have we seen each other in a while, all together? Good one, bro. You've been gone so long. Do you feel like you're better than us now? So yeah, you think you're better than us. We'll see about that. This is my normal voice. I do a voice for the other 130 episodes that we've done. Well, maybe they're trying to conserve torch light or something? Torches are expensive. What? Okay. (laughter) Ooh! Is it a surprise party? Luci, it's close to your birthday, isn't it. You guys are a bunch of namby-pambies. Well I mean, I'm not going to-- it's dark. All right then, I'll-- You want to come in the front way with me? (sighs) Fine. All right, we're all going in the side entrance, then? I'll make some space. Not yet. Wait for it. Wrong one. You want to roll the big one. 21. Do you need to make some sort of prayer or something before we go in there? Could you tell her to guide you a little better? Burn some incense, man, come on. Let's go. Because there's no one here. You guys are freaking out over nothing. They turned off the lights. Yeah, yeah, he always had the nice, flowery-- If you must. We can't get into this tunnel we've gone in our whole lives? Oh, it's locked. What are you doing over there? You praying? What are you doing over there? What is that? Like death? It's probably just a rat or something. You know, those ran down here all the time. All right, I'm still not a hundred percent sure that this isn't some crazy surprise party or something. I don't know, maybe I was wrong. Yeah, that could be hors d'oeuvres. How? Thoughts? I'll take it. Give me a crack. (growls) I'll take my glaive and-- (grunting). 21. 11 points of damage. Going to need some light in here. Can I look at some of the bodies and see if I can discern the method of death? Be it burning or slashing or strangling. 14 to look in. All right. (grunting) Punch the door. Even though I rolled a two. I did. It's plus six, so that's eight? How come none of us ever used a tower in this game? Are you going to barf? You sure? Because there's blood and guts and brain all over the place. Don't go any further. Wait until we come up with some kind of plan or something, man. I brought one with me. If you guys need to stock up, I'll watch your backs. Do the woodland creatures tell you where he is? All right, I get it. You don't like that I don't have a career. I don't know. You're always ragging on me to finish school and make something of myself. I get it. I just don't want to be a craftsman. Yes, it is. Let's go. Dead or alive? Where are the living quarters? Any light or signs of life up there? Or any carts that aren't usually garaged here? I better stay right behind you. There's no animals to protect you. You need a real weapon or something. Yeah. License to kill, man. All right. They could be waiting for us. Still be cautious, and we'll go in. You want me to go first, or you? All right. (grunting) Dad? How many times can you do this Guidance thing? I'm going to run to his closet. This is Dad's room? We've got to go upstairs. You want to be the tip of the spear this time, Larry? I mean, he lives here. Of course you're going to smell him here. That would involve you helping other people, though. What, him? Let me go first. All right, I'll hoof it up the stairs and make for father's study. Oh, you're fucking with me. You're always fucking with me. You're always riding me. I'll back up against the door and press it open with my shoulder. Ow. Fuck. Lawrence, hide Portia's eyes. She can't see this. You'll faint. It's too gross. Who was? Yeah, that's true. Are you going to barf? Who would have known where we all are? And why would they want us to come? This is all a big trap for me? Is it me? This is for me, isn't it? Let us, let us-- I don't want to wolfsplain to you. (laughter) No! You can do whatever you want. You're smoother-- You going to barf? Are you CSI-ing this right now? Just looks like a bunch of blood. Sneak attack. She fought. This is fucked up. All right. The crypts, our family crypts. It's on the premises? Before we barrel down there, we should make sure that there's no one else living or dead around. I want to check our room, let's go check our room. What? Now? Now? You're just going to run off into the woods? There's someone-- Question. In my bed, in the hollowed-out bedposts, was my girly parchment still-- They're still in there. I'll pocket those. In England, they call math "maths" and they call sports "sport." Oh, they were using it for toilet paper. I did that a lot when we were kids. No, I did not kill our family and go through your shit. This is in Aurra's room? I do too! I speak Elvish. That was our secret twin language. Do you want to keep it? Found a stinky bag, and a knife, and some poo pages. Yeah, here's the bag. Do you recognize it at all? What? They came visiting? Man? Woman? So he was an elf in disguise. Was he studying here, or doing business? Do you remember his name? Was it an 'A' word? Ah? Eh? Well, sometimes it helps me if I think of the first letter. Smell check. Natural 20. We're big on smells in this family. I'm going to find some burnt coal or burnt wood, streak across my face a couple times, getting ready for battle. Oh shit. Anything you need to do to prepare? We're going into some shit down there. That's creepy. How about you, Aurra? Are you ready for this? You want to turn now? Well yeah, but you don't have to-- I mean, you're pretty scary when you're a wolf. All right. Well, maybe not yet. Haven't seen that in a while. I'll guess you'll lead the way, then? Is that where we're going? Lawrence? I think the moon is affecting you. Your hands are already turning. I slap his hand into his face when he looks down at it. Well, she had a natural one. 11. Climb the wall? Do it again and take the better number. Other things. There's no door or windows? Let's go around. You're going to go with Aurra? All right. Want to take the other side? So you're with Aurra and Lucius then? Because we're pretty awesome. Oh, that seems fair. Jesus. There's only one door in? Should we just bum rush it? Now we don't smell anything yet, do we? I think that-- Oh boy, look at this map! Liam, you've gone above and beyond. But wait, there's a lot of bad guys here. And it's not moving? LIAM No, beginning to move. So let's get those initiative rolls, guys. This episode not brought to you by stat trackers. 16. Should have prayed. All right, Portia. You've got a badass sword-- We're just going to run away. I don't hear anything. LIAM and Jiggle the tip? Jiggle the cord? Yes. Curses are more for reactions. Well, I don't know what yours are. (singing) 'Cause I don't want to take his head off. He's dead? He's deader. Portia! Oh man! I'm going to see my sister in trouble, and be like No way! I run up to her, on her six. I can get there, right? Glaive attack the skeleton that's on her! That's a 21 to hit! Sure! That's seven points of damage. Not moving? Am I within range of the dog? I'll spin and attack this dog! Not even knowing if it's a good dog or a bad dog. Okay. Ka-kow! Ooh. 25. It's great. Okay. Oh, we've got a lot of dudes here, right? Bonus action, I'm going to whisper a solemn prayer and cast the Rite of the Frozen on my weapon. It lasts until you-- shit. Until a rest? LAURA and I'll look it up, you just DM. Oh, I take six points of damage. Yep. From casting the rite. That's it, that's my move. It lasts until your next short or long rest. The rite. It goes until we take a rest. Three seconds. You got hit, Portia? Are they going to attack him? You better wolf out there. Watch out, Porsh. What's wrong with you? I said watch out. Are they just bad at this spell? I think the skeletons are on our side, guys. It's Entangle, yeah. That's true. She can still move, right? You. Yes. Yes. You can also move if you wanted to move your person over there. You are. Because it's raining? (laughter) Yeah. Rev those engines. Yeah, come on, pull a Taliesin. Let's do it. Rough. I will yell out-- I will yell out, "Lawrence!" With my twin rage, I will run towards him as fast as I can. When I get there-- Oh, is that thing going to get a swipe on me? I'm going right past him. I want to get up in the face of the people that my brother is fighting. Sure, but is the guy-- the fucker on the ground going to get a swipe at me? Okay. Yeah, I'll keep going-- Sure. Well, I want to get in range of both of the people who are attacking Lawrence. Stop there, and I'll attack the first. I can always after I kill him-- I'll attack the imposing guy-- 20 to hit. I've got my frozen damage activated. Whoa. 16 points of damage, some of that is cold damage. I don't know. All right. I can't move any closer to the other dudes. I mean, would that get me in with the other skeletor? Not so fast, little man. I will attack the other skeleton. I got you, bro! 22 to hit. 11 points of damage. As a bonus action? I'd like to noogie my brother. (grunting) Two for flinching! Fisticuffs? Your fist is on fire? (whispering) Wrong guy. Wow, this guy's tough. Hey, you got it! So holier-than-thou. (like Lucius) Have you heard the good word? They're all leaving. They belong in a museum. Who's the lady on top? Are we going to kill her? You're rolling for all these guys. Liam, you're such a fair play. All right, Aurra. She's a wolf. I don't know what that means. Oh, wait, but it says wolf, add two. You can heal her. Claw her to death. Rip off her head. Restrain her head by ripping it off. Do it. What is this, unarmed strike? Wait, so what is she adding to this? Plus five. I love Lucy. What are you going to pray for over there, T? (childlike) Bless mama, and papa. Lucky you. Yeah, it just happens. I was also hurt. No. Healing Word is just for one person. Come on, Sha Sha. Such a middle child thing to do. (laughter) Whoa, when did you get so fast? You have an action to dash. Maybe? I'm looking at my sister running towards these skeletons and I'm very confused. What are we doing? What? All right, I'm going with Portia, I don't know, seems like she knows what she's doing. I mean, the nerds can take care of the chick on the roof, right? Yes. On her right. Was it? No, I'll just wait. Yeah, you're not allowed to move then hold an action, are you? I don't know how this works. I will stand at the ready. You know what? To make it easier on you, I'm going to use my action to, what is it, I can't do patient defense, right? I'm not a monk. Dodge, I'm doing a dodge. Wait, you're in? Why didn't you go in? Oh no, these guys are attacking? What did you do, Portia! Why would you do this? I can't leave her there alone! I love my family. I like her better than you, you big dweeb. One of them who comes into my range. I will attack, because I'm a polearm master, but I only rolled a ten. (grunts) Even though I'm dodging? I don't know, that's a reaction. I don't know how this works. My action was to dodge. My reaction was to polearm strike. No, I have polearm master. I get to attack when they enter my range. Great. Points? Oof, rough. Fuck her up, fuck her up. Sure. Oh! Yeah, he knows where the better siblings are. Come on, pray or something, man. We're dying out here, bro. Yeah, you got to pray. (singing) Pray! It was my plan to get them all to clump up together, so you could do this, right? I will charge and attack and roll a 13! Oh yeah. 13 points of damage. I grab an arm and be like, Why're you hitting yourself? (laughter) All right. Oh no, where's Larry? We didn't say anything. That's great. You've won an amazing piece of... stuff. Where'd the map go? We're done with that? Okay. We can start exploring without Laura. Nice! Yeah! Oh! That sounds like a threat. What religion is this, dude? That's crazy! Yeah, but wow, that was ice cold. All right, I guess I'll go jab her with the glaive. Twist a little. One more twist. Okay. She's alive?! Oh. (laughter) Let's go get Dad. The elf. Oh, are you still down there? All right, let's go. Do we need to do anything first? Anyone need to heal? Oh yeah, yours must be wearing off soon. How's that work? We've got to rush to our father's aid, right? Are you okay? Yeah, he's got no hand. Free rest is a half hour. Oh, we decided to take like a break. We didn't want to alert the bad guys of our plans. How were you down there? Was it scary? When I die, I want to be buried down here with the others. Not in the freaking woods, haphazardly, on a rainy night. I want there to be a big funeral where everyone comes and says things, and-- Oh yeah. While we have this moment, Luci. It's been nagging me. You know, being a holy man, are you allowed to, like-- you know. You know. Come on, you allowed to be with a lady or anything? Or do you have to be all chaste? Wait. (laughter) What? Oh man, I should have paid more attention! Most of those times that she was giving us those talks, I painted on an eye and I napped out, but whoa! I should have paid more attention. Wow. We're taking a short rest. I'm going to use my hit die to restore to my total. I'm back to full. Wait, now we have extra hit points? Wow, crazy. That will come in handy. What are you going to say? What do you need? Oh, yeah. I'll lead the way. Before we go down there, I'm going to cast the Rite of the Flame on my glaive, because the short rest has lost that. (Professor Frink voice) To glaive! Yeah. You want to go first and check for them? Or do you want me to do my thing? But there's a hole in front of her crypt? Tomb? Lawrence! I'm following as fast as I can. That's good! From where? That way? I'm going. (running noises) Yeah. No, just storming. I have very tiny feet. Twins in front. Yin and yang. For now. Are you going to wolf out? Message, or something? What was it? (singing) Pray, pray. It was in Aurra's room. It was in a bag. It was no big deal. Guys, you're making too much of it. There's just some bad guys out there, we're going to kill them, then we're going to have the party that I was promised. What? Huh? You want to get rid of it? Oh gosh, she's freaking out. I think I'm going to wolf out. (howling) Benicio. My arms, from prior burning, don't really have a lot of fur on them. They're mostly-- Scar tissue and skin. Then, the rest of me is-- You know black and white cookies? So mostly white on this half, mostly black on this half. Real matted and nasty. Whoa! I instinctively just sniff him all over the place. 90 feet? Wolf charge! (howling) Ting, ting, ting! This is a giant map! Where are we? Oh, we went through the hole? What? We still have weapons and stuff, right? What are you going to do? You've got a thing? 20 for me. Well, you're not a wolf! It's the same exact order as last time! Ting, ting, ting! Oh god! He could kill Dad. You can't pass. You're the wolf. What's that? What?! Wait, you can do that? I will run up the stairs. First of all, I'll be like How the fuck did I get here? Then I'll run up the stairs, with fury in my-- Eyes. And I'm going to grab Dad and pull him. I'm going to pull Dad. I'm going to grab Dad and try to pull him away. Strength check? Do I get more strength? Does strength go up? Okay. 15. Do I have him, or is he still wrapped up? No one look at me! I'm going to keep dragging him down the stairs. Well, I got him free! Wait, the piercing damage is halved because I'm a werewolf. So it's only two points or three points? Okay. Plus 15 points. Constitution save, 19. (ululating) Always the weakling coward, Lawrence. Hiding in a cove. I went in and killed Dad, like a real brave guy! No, I think it's fine. Is this part of the party? Our father is dying. Or dead, so if there's any way to, you know, not make him-- Save Dad. She's got one additional action to use? Bonus action? Matt usually lets us do Healing Word. If you cast a higher level spell for your action, you can use a level one spell. So Liam. If we can't hear, did we see that happen? Oma? Kill Grandma! Oh yeah, where is she? Wrong character. With claws, you're going to get 3d6 plus five. No, 3d6 plus 15. You had told us in an email that she gets 1d6 plus five and we get 1d6 plus four. But some of that she must have resistance to. Math is the worst part. Maths. Johnny Maths. You're a werewolf. Slashing, piercing and bludgeoning is reduced by half. Iron Woe? What does that even mean? Benicio! I attack Grandma. Yeah, with glaive action. Ooh, that's no good. That's only 15 to hit. Meemaw? Attack again! 21. Yeah! Okay, that is 13 points of damage. I don't know how much of that she actually takes. Five points of those are fire damage and eight of them are slashing. Then with my bonus action, since I am a polearm master, I will hit her with the back of the weapon as well. It's a bonus attack. Which is only 16 to hit. Fail. No, I'll stay put; guard Dad. Claw attacks are with advantage? Oh, okay. No, you don't. shop.critrole.com? Is that what it is? You can't cast without-- If it was a verbal spell-- Oh boy, we're in it now, guys. (baby voice) The Iron Woe. Are you going to barf? Come on, Aurra. Boy, Portia. You might die. You might straight up die. Oh, we all took damage. I think I took damage. That's right. You have to know how much damage you took, too. By attack, it's a physical attack. Like, you hit. Not with a spell. It's nine. You're already a wolf wolf, you can't be a double wolf. Oh my god! There's another wolf? There's one more wolf past this? Just kill her, Aurra! No, it's not. She's Hasted. (mimicking Liam) Yes, yes. (imitating Lucius) Let us pray. (whispering) TJ's notes are color coded! These are saving throws up here. Oh, you have got a really good Wisdom. Natural 20. Just one? Is it one creature? You get another chance. It's a way better one. Plus wisdom save-- It's ten. Oof. These are all with your claws? How do you do 40 points of damage with-- Jeez. Oh, okay. How do you get 15 from 1d6 plus five? Oh shit! That's beastly. Fuck it! I will roll. I rolled an 11 to maintain my calm demeanor. Now I will attack. Glaive out. Natural 20! (cheering) Whoa, okay. That's a nine, so that's 18 plus three is 21. Plus ten? I double this too? Whoa. Okay. 31 points of damage for the first attack. A lot of that is slashing and stuff though. I don't know if that affects anything. Attack number two! Oh god. Nope, 18. No? Oh, well, it's imbued with the Rite of the Flame. I don't know. So what does that mean? I just missed. I will roll a second time. That is a 25 to hit. Nine points of damage. And a bonus action to attack with the back of the glaive. That's an 18. Oh! That's less. (laughter) Whoa. Wait, Dad said to stop. That's true. I didn't choke him to death. I ripped out his throat. But to save him! Sometimes we have to set free those we love. 17. (growls) It's like when I joined the fraternity. (laughter) We have established that she is magical. Come on, reindeer. Run over Grandma! Get her! Get her! So now you can cast a spell. Fuck her up! Come on, roll big, roll good. Roll nice. Terrible. Lucius. Yes? Come on, girl! (exaggerated) Shit! (old lady voice) You never visit me. (old lady voice) A call every once in a while would be nice. But I'm too far to do anything. She's more than 30 feet away from me, isn't she? (deeper voice) Yeah. Is she more than 30 feet away from me, Liam? I'm going to run up on grandma. Bye, dad. And I'm going to stab her in the butt. 19? Sorry, grandma. 13 points of damage. 13 points of damage. Your sweaters never fit. I'll stab her again in the belly. Fail. But I'll bonus action hit her in the back. That also misses. 14. That's it, and now I'm right on her and she's going to kill me. Lawrence, save me! Don't you have something you can throw? Want to keep dashing? Werewolves are tough, man. Whoever wrote these blood hunters and lycans is just-- Terrible. Yeah. Right now, where do you think he is right now? Yes, what plane of existence. It's almost your turn. Is this a spell? Is this an attack spell? I will invoke my Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet. I need to know that the spell's being cast. I'm right up on grandma. I don't know if-- Oh, this is being cast by invisible fucktod. Oh, Lucius. The Iron Woe. Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, don't disrespect your grandma. You got this. So roll the square one twice. It just stays? You have a bonus action. Hasted action, and movement. Hasted action she could only do a melee hit. It's plus five. You have a bonus action if you wanted to heal anyone. For the bad guy? Is he visible now? Where is he? Oh! (whispers) Okay, this is good. It's like this guy's played before. Wow. "I would like to pray." TJ's doing all the moves. Just "okay." Por-tia! C'mon, take her down, Portia. Some points, some damage. This is it. Ooh, yikes. I'm sorry, Grandma! And I will attack, terribly. I will attack again, much better, 23. My glaive. Oh, so that's the first attack? That's a 23 to hit. All right, and that is 15 points of damage. This is my second attack, also at advantage? That's crazy. Miss. Bonus. Natural 20! The bonus strike is less, guys. The bonus strike is only a d4 plus three. I would like to stick the glaive through her pelvis bone and just kind of go around in a circle. And then let go! In your face, Lawrence! That's how a man does it! Wow. The drow is down? He's running? Aurra! End him. Spill him! I would like to use my Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet-- On the dead drow. I want him to wake up and, with his last bit of life, give Lawrence a wedgie. Yeah, sure. I'm going to amplify-- --which adds my wisdom modifier to it, which is a plus four. I don't know, do I roll? What am I doing? Six plus four. Wasn't me, bro. He just really must hate you. Oh, blood is coming out of me! I just took two points of damage. The drow? Liam O'Brien. But not start with a druid.
