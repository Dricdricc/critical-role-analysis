Just keep saying Fidelio. D&D Beyond! Yes, D&D Beyond wanted to announce that their 826LA donation campaign has officially come to an end, and they've raised $11,400 for 826LA based on 114 natural ones rolled through the end of June. We are terrible, but our bad luck is the kids' good fortune. The main thing that people have been wondering and talking about on The Facebooks and stuff is the new baby. Travis and Laura aren't here, you guys might have noticed, and everyone's like, "How was the birth? How did it all go down "two Thursdays ago?" So I have taken a little license, but I have scripted a bit of a radio play that we're all going to participate in to show our viewers how it all went down two Thursdays ago, and how the birth came to be. Taliesin will be narrating, I will be playing the role of Travis, Marisha will be playing the role of Laura. Liam will be the doctor. And Matt will be a couple of different roles, including Matt Mercer. We're going to see what happens, this is a first performance of its kind. Take it away, Taliesin. Babe, can you bring me some onion rings and Miller Ice with lime? The Cowboys game starts in six weeks and I want to be ready. Huh, what?! Right now?! But the Cowboys! Ugh, I'll get the stupid hospital bag. Hey, Matt, heads up, Laura's having that stupid baby. Cool, bro. Hey, can you also tape the Dallas Cowboys game for me? Thank you guys, this was great. That was theater! You were fantastic as Laura Bailey. Yeah, my Travis is pretty good. Also from D&D Beyond, next Wednesday, July 18 at 100 PM Pacific, & BEYOND, a new weekly stream hosted by Adam Bradford and Todd Kenreck, kicks off with super-special guest Matthew Mercer. Did you know that? Okay, cool. Each week, the show will cover not only D&D, but also the guest's other passions outside of D&D, like D&D. Shenanigans will ensue, so don't miss it. Be sure to check it out at Twitch.tv/dndbeyond to watch. That's our sponsor shoutout. We'll see. Tonight. (baby-like wailing) [click, TV static] [groovy Critical Role theme] Come in, Harry, come in. Take off your robes. We don't know. Jester, I need some pocket bacon for breakfast. Jester? Jester-- oh, she's probably taking a dump in the woods. Oh, can I have some? Oh, that's even better. (eating noises) She does that sometimes. I'm sure it's nothing. That's playing-- That's playing with fire. Their personal belongings and stuff? His spats and spurs? Oh, wow. I'll take a swig to calm my morning nerves and start searching around to see if there's any notes or any signs of anything around. Okay. That's terrible. That's an eight. Whoa. Oh my god, we're not even going to know they're gone. (laughter) We got a two, a two, a one. What was your first roll? Okay, so six is our top roll so far. Can we follow those grooves? Can we see which direction those wagon tracks went in? Survival. Nine. That narrows it down! It's not east or west, guys! God damn it! Who was on watch? It was Fjord and Yasha, right? So they would have been awake. But what about Jester? She was asleep, right? Maybe they weren't targeting anyone specific, just coming to grab folks, and those were the ones that were awake, or closest to the road, or-- Well, they took the three ugliest ones. I mean, they left us. Wait. I'm going to examine the tracks for blood. Mmm. That's an 11. Anything weird about the blood? Is it green blood, purple blood, blue blood? That means that they weren't bleeding when they were dragged, which means that either they were killed by vampires and all their blood was sucked out of them first, or they were still alive. Seeing that, I will draw my new crossbow. Turn it on. I imagine it's battery-powered. (powering-up noise) (laughter) Sure. Ooh! What?! Whoa! How? This is terrible, here. So much better than us. Oh, she's challenging us. What's going on up there?! Should I kill something? (shouts) I think she means Shadycreek Run. Just one? I'm going to walk up next to Molly. Should I kill her? You can come up now, Caleb. (smug giggling) Why? Oh, your flask runs out? (smug giggling) Sorry. He's very weak. (laughter) Don't worry. It's a cat, usually. Ooh! I like you already. Here, do you have a cup or something I could pour into? All right, I'm going to take out my flask and pour a good, healthy, half quantity. You have to drink it fast. It will disappear soon. Yes. What? I am the greatest detective of all times! I poured one drink, and I solved the case! (laughter) How do you know? Who are they? Did you lose someone? (weak growl) Oh, I should take off the mask. It's more scary that way. (growl) (stuttering) Jeff. It's Nott. Herr Bush. Why don't you come back to our camp? No, aren't we in the road? Oh, did we come back? Oh, okay. Cool. Who are they? Why are they operating this far from "the Run?" Also what kind of slavers-- These are powerful people that they just kidnapped. Okay, okay. You don't know us. I gave you a little bourbon! I'm a lady. I gave you some booze. The least you could do is afford us the benefit of the doubt. Beau is terrible with relationships and social interactions! Do you know any of their names, the Shepherds? Who are they? 20 gold is expensive. Wait, so if you could rescue your friends, or friend, or whatever-- Are you sure? So it's revenge, then. I just imagined some crazy shit. (laughter) You're confident that you can lead us to these Shepherds. How many of them are there? Hey, we're five! Don't put yourself down like that. I'm sure you can hold your own. You know, when we were in Zadash, we heard the town crier talking about kidnappings in Nogvurot. That's close to Shadycreek Run. Could that be the same people, do you think? Iron Chef. Here, let me pour you some more booze. Does that help? This is all connected! It's like a conspiracy, and we're in the middle of it! In large part. The subject was confused as to what a detective is. I'm not writing. I don't have a quill. It's something that me and one of our lost friends talked about a lot. Sorry. We'll kill these folks, or try to anyway. What if one gets away? We're going to hunt them down over our lifetime? I don't know, what if they go far away? Are we indebted to you forever now, or can we put a 30 day cap on this? Nothing. You sure sound like our new leader. Oh yeah, no. I mean, he's got the intelligence. Are you just walking? Do you have any means of transportation? We do. Oh, we have a map of some sort? Should we lay it out on the table and see if-- Weights? Thank you. But we'd have to ditch some gear, or do we have enough horses to carry everything including shields? Can we carry all of our friends' stuff on a horse? We have six horses, I think. It's not? It's not special to her in any way? The big things we're leaving? All right. No, we should leave them. Why don't we kill it and take some meat? All right, let's just leave it. I mean, the horses are all named after-- Poop. So we can probably-- I believe we're going to take WC, Loo, John, Crapper, and Toilet, but we're going to leave Loaf. (laughter) We're going to drop a quick Loaf, then go. It's always better to drop a Loaf before you go. Sure. Skidmark. Is one of us steering the journey, and can another one of us be looking for clues or things along the way? Are you cold? Swimming in it. Why are you hiding your face? Do you want to look at the thing, the orb? Okay, you're good. We have to look at the orb at some point too or hexagon. Dexa-- MATT and Thank you. But we won't encounter as many foes. Okay. Are we trying to avoid people or-- Caleb, you're in charge. Which way are we going? Well he's so-- Caleb. We want to keep going, don't we? As fast as we can. Was there anyone in that house? Oh. I'll go take a look. I'll look for you. 18. I have an extra flask. I will fill that with oil. Nice. I'll just go around and ask does anyone need any torches? I found a bunch. You can each have one. And how about a handaxe, anyone? Want another drink? ASHLY & (pouring noise) Okay. 13. I'm staying in the house, and I'm going to cover myself up with some detritus of different chairs and things, near the window. I'm hiding. 13. Aw. Oh! Should we move this map? Oh boy. Oh gosh! Ashly, welcome to the show. It's been a while. Yes, but that doesn't count. Weren't you on the show-show at some point? (gasps) That's terrible. I mean, we're rectifying it right now. The romantic cruise thing. Yeah. Yeah, The Ass Sailor was the name of the-- Oh! You were in the bar! The bar was, yes, The Ass Sailor. I thought we were all going to dress up tonight. You got that. Ten. Nega-snitch. Okay. They killed Molly! Yeah, I'm looking through the window of the house, the homestead, and I'm 100 feet away? There's nothing I can do. I'll start walking towards the fight. Yeah, that'll take me 60 feet. Sure. I'm going fast. Where is Keg? Did I just run past Keg on my way? Can I hold my action until Keg gets in range? You're on a horse? I'll hold my action until someone gets within melee range of the thing, and then I will fire a crossbow. Aw, come on! This is not fair. Now we're down to John, Crapper, and Toilet. The horses' turn? Run, Crapper, run! Run like the wind! Wow. That's nice. That's like Cirque du Soleil shit. I will release my bolt. At disadvantage because more than 30 feet away. (inhale through teeth) Ooh, that's only a 12. Sorry, sorry! That's-- that's on me. I did not-- I'm sorry! I'm just drunk. I'm drunk, I'm day drunk. Oh yeah, I got a new crossbow. Oh wow. Because you're fast. (car zoom) Wow. ASHLY and I'll move within range, crossbow bolt range. You know what? 30. No, you know what? I'll stay put and I will cast... I will cast Silent Image in a flanking position to Beau. And I will create a second Beau just standing there in front of the creature and try to help Beau. Yeah. And I'll bonus action hide, just behind that little-- Sure, great. Natural 20. (cheering) Great. Ooh. It's not as emotionally deep as this one. Yep. Wow. That's great. Maybe. Nope. Ooh. You're going to keg stand there? There's horses around, there might be a pony keg at some point, I don't know. We're going to work on it. Hey! Get away from me! No! There's no advantage because my Silent Image is there? I'm going to take off running after the horses to see if I can catch up with them. Didn't we leave the shield? John, Crapper, and Toilet. Water Closet's dead. We can go check Water Closet I guess? That would be a three. I'm going to try to cut out the tongue. Maybe that's something I can eat later. Ugh. I don't know that. (sobbing) (eating noises) Maybe the two smalls should-- What? I've bonded with its essence now. I've got the booze. Would that work? Wait, we have three-- yeah, okay. I noticed back there that you were using your hands and weapon stuff and things. You're not a healer or anything? You don't have any potions of healing or anything that could maybe heal someone if anyone needing healing would-- No one now, but in the future-- it's a frequent occurrence for us. Do any of us have any potions? She had a Greater Healing potion, however, I don't know if she had that on her or kept it in the sack. I think we have her notebook in the locker. No, I felt around in there. Did the light just change in here? The light is moving. Just stare back. I have a couple of empty vials, but they're small. I've worked with chemicals before, I could try to put this acid in the vials and stopper them. Sure. Would three vials of acid be useful to us? Sure, all right. I'll try to make a little needle prick in the bladder and try to pour them into these vials that I got from The Gentleman. Okay. That's 16. I have three from The Gentleman. Okay. Great. Would you like one? You did this. I don't know how I would put it on there. Why don't you take one? Molly, do you want some acid? Do you want to drop some acid? Caleb, do you want--? How about I'll give you two, and I'll keep one since I already have one that I made. All right. Here you go. Are we friends again? What time is it? Sorry. Oh, well, we can make some more headway on the road and then go at full dark. We could camp at full dark. Jesus. Help action! Oh. Wait, no. What? Huh? Oh. (laughter) Okay. Wait, which chat? Okay, cool. You've said that. You said that, right? (hooting) One, two, three. What the fuck was that, Matt?! There was an owl that just hooted on the soundtrack. We were all spooning. Where? Is Caleb gone? No! Okay. I didn't know if he was a phantom or something. Of course. It's a baby. Maybe you should not go first. I'm going to not follow, but go off to the side and try to go around the other way. 16. I'll slowly emerge from the shadows. Guys, D&D Beyond is a wonderful platform, in which you can organize your statistics and your equipment and they've just recently done a revamp of their layout. Liam, how do you like it? And it's customizable! Nice. Yes. Stop! (whispering) Bastard. Ah! I forgot you were with us! Well these people have suffered the same fate that our frie-- We're mutually-- We're going after the same people that have affected them. Some people are just good. Related to you? The subject seems to be exhibiting signs of distress, or at least annoyance. It's breakfast. I'll take one. Yes, thank you. What does it do? Do you smoke it? See? People are just nice sometimes. Yes, we should keep going to find their friends. Do you know someone named Pumat Sol? How about one of his friends Pumat Sol or Pumat Sol or Pumat Sol? I just thought maybe they knew each other. I don't know how many of these there are! No! I don't know every goblin! There's lots of goblins! I never-- All right, all right, point taken, point taken. (laughter) No, that was really good! Not the firbolgs we just met, right? You were talking about the people who kidnapped our friends. I think-- we're still talking about the people who kidnapped our friends. Sure, sure. And maybe even complete our mission. At a fast pace Matthew-- I'm on horseback with Caleb right? Could I be on the back, maybe just flipping through Jester's sketchbook? Okay, I'm going to look through the whole thing. Is it all drawings? Are there any notes, or letters, or clues to her past? Common, Goblin, Halfling. Keep it to myself. [yelling] Keep steering Caleb, I'm looking at nudie pictures! Are we getting close to where you think their headquarters are? Let's do it. 13 total. I'll take watch with Keg. 13. Chilly. Sure glad I have all this booze to drink to keep me warm. Wouldn't you like some? Well, it tastes good, though. So there's that, too. I'm not trying to cozy up to you! I think we got off on the wrong small feet. I have to bare my teeth at everyone! Look at these things, they're huge! No, I have very thin lips, very long teeth, some would call them fangs. It's not my fault. When I smile, it looks like I'm trying to bite your throat off. (snarls) And I like tongue. I was eating some tongue when you saw me. No! Oh god, no. You're a handsome woman, but-- you're a woman, right? Okay, good. Just making sure. I don't know! I don't want to presume anything. All right, here you go. You know, it never runs out. No. Special trick. So, uh, who got took? Who are you missing? No! What? I thought we were getting to know each other. All right, did you go to school? Hmm, I would say no. Did you have a happy home life growing up? Hmm. I'm trying to think of a topic that's less charged. Do you have a favorite sports team you like? (laughter) Iron Chef? I love Iron Chef. Never mind. I just thought, well-- No, I just thought if we knew more about your situation, it would maybe lead to clues that would help us track down, or know the weaknesses of these Shepherds who stole or killed your friends. If we knew the circumstances around their untimely demise. Were you one of them? Did you go to high school-- no, you didn't go to school-- Hmm, everyone else is snoring. All right. I'm doing what any good detective does, which is just lay the groundwork for the case-- Jester. Jester's one of the folks that got stolen. Together we were a dynamic duo of mystery solving. We could solve any mystery. Find any criminal mastermind, no matter how nefarious. We had all the tools, all the insights, all the instincts! It was amazing. We were a well oiled machine and then... she was taken. And now it's just me. I resent that. All right. Well, I'll try to help you get revenge on your vague past. (laughter) Sure, sure. How about you tell me one fact about you and I'll tell you one about me? Here you go. (pouring noise) I'm a pretty good dancer! I didn't know! I didn't know! I thought we were going to start small and then build! You gave me the heaviest shit first though! Of course! Well, this has been fun. It's got five wheels. Caleb, should I go check them out? Oh, okay. Are they suspicious? All right. We can go. What? Caleb, look at this picture of you in Jester's book. It's really funny. Oh, no? They're moving, right? We don't even know who they are yet, though. We love our guests. We love them. I definitely deduced that from our conversation. It's not surprising to me in the least. I lied too. I'm an average dancer. (laughter) Want some more booze? We told you that. We said that multiple times. Yeah, how? Can you go owl it out? Yeah, he usually narrates as he sees. Sometimes you do. Why not? There's five of us and-- We have an owl. At night, maybe after they've camped. Or a fortress or something. Should we just continue to follow them for now or attack right now in the broad daylight? Oh! We know where they're going. We know where they are. Why don't we ride ahead of them-- Yes! Thank you. I'd better get drunk, then. On the same road? We're not even going to go around? You're gross, Marisha. Why don't you look at that dodec? Wow, mine's 19. 12? Maybe. This one's aroused, who knows what's going to happen. (laughter) Oh, interesting. Well, we would want them to get going in the morning, right? But not immediately get ambushed, like settle into a little bit of a pace for an hour or two. Yeah, somewhere around there. A couple miles. Yeah, that's the key. Oh, it's dark now, right? Ooh! We need to plan the ambush. We don't have a cart to block the road with. What do we have? You could stand in the middle of the road and distract them. What if we did like a-- --like a Red Dawn thing? (laughing) We dug a hole, and then we got in the hole-- --and they came over us and we popped out of the hole and we grabbed onto the cart and we rode under it and then we like chopped a hole in the bottom of the cart. It would be really cool! Oh! (pause) No. Let's figure out what we do have, though. We have four vials of acid. Oh! We could just kill all the horses. We could just ambush the last one. Do you have anything we could use? --we guys. You're part of the team now too. Druid. What's our primary goal? Just to stop them and prevent them from fleeing? Yes, so we have to stop the path, right? We have to block them from escape. How do we do that? Do we fell a tree? Can we fell a tree? We could fell the tree right on them as they come by. Kill all the horses first so they can't get away? Ooh, that's pretty good. I could also Mage Hand and start unlocking cages. Okay. How do you propose? If we're trying to split them up, you could just slow the last carriage further down the road and they'd drift apart a bit, I don't know. I see. Do we have any other weapons or any other special things? I have a gun! (laughter) No you're not going to take the gun! No you're not! I'll take acrobatics. It's only 11. I don't know. Sure, sure. First of all, I'm not good at finding traps, but I've found a few and the ones I've found have been rope based. I could do a tripwire... for the horses? Okay, so we fell a tree in front of the road. They stop to move it. I'm in there, unlocking things. They've already stopped, though. Sure, sure. Keg goes in to distract, Caleb kills the horses. Yes, of course. (laughing) This is a great plan. The winning part especially. Amazing. (laughter) Are you aroused? Ah, help, I'm under a tree! Also, you hate me. I'm going to dig a hole just in case. This Red Dawn thing. Sure. On the tops of the hills, and then one for me right in the middle of the road under the earth. Yes, absolutely. Let's do it. Crafting party. But you can't know the map because we just came up with this ambush plan tonight. There's no way that you would have foreseen something like this happening. Can he float? Day? I wasn't. We have a green room? Oh, the makeup room. Are we going to do a studio tour at some point? You know, one of the things about the makeup room is it has those hair salon sinks where you can get a haircut in it or get your hair washed in the sink. Can I get my hair washed in one of those? Can we move some of those bushes up? Up on top of the hill? Can we snap some twigs and make the bushes bigger? Yeah, fluff the bushes a little bit. Yeah, let's do that. Oh my god. We're Minecrafting. About there. And we're going to do that over here a little bit. This thing can't move, right? Holy shit. It's like Rocky IV. --in the middle, or should we-- I'm aroused. Sam Riegel is. Should we put it here, to narrow the passage? Okay. Is this thing hollow at all? That's where I'll hide. Tomorrow. Caleb, any other terraforming we want to do over here? Are we-- We added some bush up here and up here-- to hide in, so then one person can hide here, one person can maybe hide here. We moved this over and it's got a little nook in it, so Nott can stay in there. But we have this tree here. Do we want to knock over that tree and block the path? How tall is this tree, Matt? So it only-- How about this? If I may. This log that we've set on this side, what if we set it on this side over here-- --and then we weaken the tree in case we need to tip it over-- --and block the other half. So now we can weaken this tree, maybe, with some chops and then-- --it can block the other half. Sure. To controlled-- Interesting. Do we want to do any digging? Any mudding? Anything else? Is this our ambush? Me? I'm going to be in the log, someone's going to be up here in bush one, someone's going to be in bush two. Someone will be behind the tree. Caleb, where are you going to be? Wait, I thought Caleb was the Bush Man. (laughter) Just dry run it here, dry run it. Okay. The cart's coming, it gets slowed. "Oh, what the fuck's going on?" Then Slow it? But it doesn't stop, it just slows. So right here, it slows. They're like, "What the fuck's going on?" They're already past us, then. We'll stop them. Yeah. Or we do this, we slow them or whatever, and then-- Then they get here, "Oh, crack!" Or maybe we stop them first, crash, stop, everything stops, then we hit them with Slow. Oh, fuck! So should we let one cart go first, and then? On the first cart? So the first thing that happens is the trunk, the tree. The second thing that happens is Slow. The third thing that happens is I pop out of the tree trunk-- Which cart are they going to be on? Which should I start with? The small one or a big one? Did I give you a scroll of Invisibility? Could you use it on me? Or would that ruin your books? An hour? Meters. I'm not going to attack, I'm just going to jump on a cart in the fracas and try to find a cage or two. On people. On magic users. Can you? That's my voice, Ashly. Up there, in bush land, are you going to be able to do anything? But that would get you on the cart with the bad guys. You can't just rain down terror from above? I'm ranged. We'll huddle together. Who's Lucky Pierre? Who's in the middle? They're already here. I look in. Before we go, I'm going to whisper to Caleb Caleb, if anything goes shitty, I'm going to throw my flask of oil on the first cart. Light it on fire. Clarota? Oh shit! I'm so scared. Hold me, Ashly! Come on, Keg. (chanting) Keg, Keg, Keg! How did you have that? (laughter) 18. Ah! Is that cocked? I can't tell if that's cocked. I need a ruling from-- oh, it fell. 21. Hey, don't leave! We might be ending now! We're starting this? I don't know how I'm going to get on this fucking cart! How am I going to get on this cart? I'm not invisible! All right. I'll run past Lorenzo. As I run, I will dump all my oil on him. Yep, that's my action. Bonus action disengage. And jump into the cart and start doing this. Yeah. Oh, shit! They're invisible cages? The part of me that hit the cage is now invisible also? That's all I've got. I'm sure I pushed as far as I could. Come on, this is what you live for! You've got ball bearings! It's a perfect plan. It's now or never. Ki questions. Wow, Slow is the best! Not a sorcerer?! You got it wrong! The cover of bush? Yeah, we had him all bushed. He'll resist it. Yes! Come on, motherfucker! Wow, we stumped him. The only good plan that we've ever made is without Travis and Laura here. Let's make that clear. Are you doing a throwback right now? Oh no. He can cast?! I thought you said he was a fighter! Your information is the worst! Rogues are the worst. Oh! Oh, that wasn't damage. I thought that was damage, okay. Oh, you ditched. That's fine. Yeah, there's 12 players. Which one? Do the horses get an attack of opportunity? We're still alive! All right, Keg! Kill them all in one turn! From 45 feet away. He is covered in oil, which makes him kind of sexy. Away? Jesus. Ugh, you're the worst! And it will do it over all of the--? Oh no. What the fuck is that?! He's a dragon-man?! What is this? Jesus! What the fuck is that?! You know what? I'll use my luck. Terrible! 11. I'll halve that. Oh no, he's winning! All right, I think I have to use an action to unlock this cage. To pick the lock. Fuck you! Five plus, I don't know. What is it usually, seven? 12? I'm going to move around the cages or between them, so that I turn completely invisible. Nope! That's a three. Can I use my bonus action to-- Jesus, what can I do for my bonus action? I can't hide. Can I hide? I got nothing else to do on a bonus action. So yeah, I will try to hide. I'll go on the side of the cart and-- I'll hide off the side of the cart. Oh, that's wonderful. It's 29! Of at least Lorenzo. May I ask a weird question, Matt? The guy that I was trying to break out of the cage is he alive? Would I have seen that before I tried to unlock the cage? Okay, cool. Down like dead? Yes, land on the horse's back! You got this, guys. You got this. Big rolls! Is it your big dice? It's cocked. Oh god, is he still going to attack you? Oh no! Do you get a reaction? Do you have anything? Oh, god. Oh, god. Catch it. I'm invisible! What do I do? Lorenzo hasn't been hit yet, has he? ASHLY and Once, but he's not going to go down. I will first try to use a bonus action to use item and pour acid on one of the locks. See if that opens it. Well, shit. Then I won't do that. I will-- Shit, what do I do? I can't kill anything here. I'm going to try the lock. I'm going to try the lock. there's nothing else I can do. It's a natural one. Yes, so movement and bonus, I will run towards Caleb, but not directly at the barbarian. Let's see, movement is 30. How far could I have gotten with just movement? Yeah. Ah, okay. Yeah, so that's fine. Get out of there! Run! Run! (whispering) Oh, it's a slave. They get a slave. Yeah. Use your teleport spell! Wow, Ash. Good job, Ashly. Welcome to the game. No, it wasn't all your fault, just mostly. Oh, boy. I've got another vial of acid.
