Interesting choice. You're Superman? (Clarota voice) Does he talk like this? Again? Already done, friend, already done. We beat the bad guy! It's fine, it's all fine. Talk to the hive. If I may, very quickly, are you with us, Tiberius? Because you disappeared for like, the whole fight. Are you with us? Are you going to disappear again? Well, you weren't there when we needed you the most. You were out doing God-knows-what. What on earth are you talking about? Dispel Magic. Yes, I did. Do I have a will save? I turn him into a goat. Okay, then I'll Banish him. I have to touch him, right? Fuck! Oh hi, hi there. Then how did we have this whole conversation? Inspire him? I think he's pretty good on his own. I think he's about to. Is this a charm? 12. 13. We're going to be dead in ten minutes. Keyleth! (laughs) Bye, Tiberius! (laughter) I leap! To what? And stunned. (sings) Grappled and stunned, so grappled and stunned! Needed that. I'm grappled and stunned. Oh, Jesus. Because he's also got the things on me. Seven. (laughs) Plus two. Still stunned? Oh, so I got off-- This guy. Save everyone. Just run. Save yourself. Save yourself, start a new race of people. Hunter's Mark! (shrieking) Help! (gasps) He turned on us! What? None of us knew that! You know who would help us right now? Can we make her not stone? Maybe we should leave her. I don't want to deal with that. Well, that's anywhere. I think we can beat them all. Hey, man. Grog's being held prisoner by an 80-pound dude. I'm stunned! (gasps) Hi, guys! Wait, why would you-- you've got to come save us! Come on, Pikey. Still beautiful, though. (laughter) Oh boy. That ain't no good. And it's undone immediately. (laughter) You would know if you had more intellect. Do we get out of here or do we try to kill these things? I can get some of us out of here. Are we getting out or are we fighting? It's just the little brains. For now. Am I leaving or am I staying? (sighs) All right. Then I'll attack. I run up to Pike. I grab her hand. I say, "I want to have babies with you." (laughter) And we get out. We're going up to the top of the-- to the thing. Just to the roof there. Well, I didn't know that. (laughs) It's done. And, as a bonus, I'm going to send some inspiration to Grog. Put her in the Bag of Holding! No, put her in the bag! I would like to raise. But what if there's gold down there to find? Does she fall in love with the first thing she sees? (laughter) I'm fine, baby. How are you? You're low. You're super low. Oh! Do I get an inspiration for that? I'm never going to wash it again. I'm just looking into her eyes the whole time. Oh, I do. I don't need it though. I'm at 20. Can I sing for her? She was at 23! That's 22. That's one point! Baby, come on. Wait, top of the round? Should I kill the brain, or try to kill the brain? The brain is down there in the puddle? In the pool? Is that big scaffolding still hanging over it? But it's not right over the thing? Or it could not. Is it super heavy? And how high above it is it? Like, would it get a significant amount of force? Unless I made it fall-- Do I do that or do I just Lightning Strike? Okay. I'm feeling handsy. (laughter) Of the brain. Well, that's not good. Oh, yeah! Okay, so that makes it 13 plus what? Okay, then 18. (sings) It's Bigby's Hand. Orion's my dice bimbo. 16. And bonus action, can I pour some superior healing potion down Pike's beautiful throat? I'm just pouring my potion down Pike's throat. I don't know what superior is. Do I roll or does she? Oh! 8d4 plus eight. Holy bajeez. One. 22. I got some good potion. Oh boy. (laughter) No, thank you. What? I've been doing it wrong this whole time. You're ghosting? Hanging brain! d10. Scanlan is up? We're out of here? Okay. No, I'm going to turn into a huge pterodactyl and carry some folks. Sure, why not? Great. Who can I carry? I'm going to take someone heavy. There's only one person I can take. (sings) Up, up, and away, I'm a beautiful pterodactyl. They never flew. You are. Intelligence. Don't talk about Trinket like that. (whispering) Told you we should've left Trinket behind. Wait, he's floating. Are we there? We're in a room right now? (pterodactyl screech) Do you have it anymore? You just did it to me earlier in this round. Oh. Hello. He's real. I cast Friends on him and I tell him, "You know of our Keep, don't you?" Oh, one more question before you leave, what district are we in right now? Thank you. It's a long way. We've got to go across the whole town to get there. We do have a flying carpet. What, who are you? We'll be fine, we've never lost it before. There's eight of us, we'll be fine, let's go drinking. Do you have to pee or something? We want to enjoy this. Or humor. We don't know. Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon. We pay you! Feels like a month. Cordell? I don't remember the names of any of our guards. Our staff is so unappreciated, guys. I love their banter. Is there any urgent, oppressing news, any visitors that we should know about who came while we were gone, anything before you retire for the evening? Allara? Any packages, mail, post? All right, thank you. Should we un-stone Kima, or should we sleep on it? I turn him into a rat. Nope. Yeah, we'd have to stop them on the way out the hole, right? There's only one way in and out. They don't really know what's coming for them. We could stop them on their way out. He's a rat. I'm still punishing him. So talk to Allura first, then unfreeze Lady Kima? There's a second Horn, maybe she has the other one and wants the matching set. I'm fine trusting her. I was fine trusting Clarota. He's still a rat! All right, fine. He's a human thing again. A dragonborn. Rock beats scissors. I cannot. It is not alive. I cannot. Legitimately, no one can tell when I'm lying. Let's sleep and meet with Kima in the morning. I check my bed to make sure no one shat in it. (laughter) Would you like to be a rat? Well then, no. I'm still punishing you. (laughter) Gross. Let's go down and have our meeting. That was no dream! (laughter) Can you teleport something out of a bag? All right, I will check with Mage Hand or whatever, I got something else. Mage Hand, yeah, I'll Mage Hand it. Let's heal Kima. Wait, shouldn't Grog be here, he's the one who likes her. Everything's okay, everything's okay, we're out of danger, we're at home, it's okay. We lived. Funny story, you were right about Clarota. He was horrible, we killed him. We killed him! Hey, you were right. We should've known all along, you were right, we should've trusted you, sorry. So, you're alive, that's good because you were sorta on a suicide mission. It's in a safe place. Ooh! Keep subscribing, guys, because whispering action doesn't come free. That's a lot. Keep subscribing to Geek and Sundry, where you can watch Matt Mercer whisper at people. Greyskull Keep. It's in Emon. Yes. Hypothetical. What if an army of darkness was slowly approaching Emon to kill all of us? Well, we killed Clarota and K'Varn, but we, there was a lot of bad guys down there that we could not kill-- Yes, is proximity okay? Evil Grog? Probably jury duty. Why don't you go rest? We'll summon Allura and we'll continue the conversation from there, I guess. We should use it. We lived! Wait, Laura, what did you get? Is he a fan of the show? On camera, on camera. Whoa, that's an awesome die! Whoa, the first roll was a 20! (cheering) Okay, a benefactor sent the holy charm of Sarenrae for me to present to you. In, I think, holy matrimony?
