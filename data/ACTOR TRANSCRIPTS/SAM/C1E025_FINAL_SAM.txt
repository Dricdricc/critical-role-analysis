Oh my gosh. Okay, I'd like to plug a few things. No. I've got a Google one. Oh, yes! Yes, it makes me look cute! (laughter) Wow, this thing's amazing! It's a hotel ice thing. I want to fill it up right now. I poured a whole glass in there and it looks like nothing! Is that true, no armor? Do I need to subtract things from--? Yeah, there's nothing to worry about. Tell me this, DM. When my Invisibility spell is broken, am I alerted? Do I know that? Do I sense it? First roll. Not an unimportant one. First roll of the night. Could kill Liam. Ooh. What was he trying? Who knows? Roll for coy. He's in trouble! Let's go! I'm by the bartender saying, I ordered a large. Please, can I have a slightly larger one please? What? Oh! Oh shit! Yeah. I put my mug down and I start little leg waddling towards them. As I go, I'm going to send a message. I use Message to-- who's the guy who likes us? No, not him. Sylas? No, not Sylas! Seeker Asum? Okay, I say, something's gone awry. We may need you right away. Stay in school, kids. 17. Did I hear that? Then I don't run. I Dimension Door outside of the palace wall. Not good. Oh, wait. Oh, wait. It says I have advantage on intelligence saving throws. This is not a saving throw. Then no, eight. Into an outhouse! I do! Do I? I think I do. Inside a room. I don't know where I am. It's a nice-looking room. Or you could make a wall of fire. Wait, what's going on? What do we see? DM, who is this person who's just joined us? For the audience. She's going to be doing the worst American accent possible. Do I get a save? Well, I don't know she's there. I don't know what's grabbing me. I'm not even looking at you. Insight check? Okay. Not good. Five. 15. First, I got a small drink, and now this? Don't miss. Hunter's Mark. Oh man. That's a lot of rolling. I'm going first. Fucking shit. I know she's got me in her fucking claws. Can I still see through the window? Okay, I'll use my bonus action first to cast Healing Word on Vax. (singing) Oh, that Vax elf-- Would I know that? I can't move. She's holding me. I know. I guess I'll hold my turn. Wait, no. Healing Word has a 60 feet range. You said 30! Will 60 feet hit him? Okay, then I will heal Vax. (singing) Oh, that Vax elf, getting bit by vampires, and his skin's turning pale and white. But don't worry, because around the corner, here comes Scanlan. Everything's going to be all right. Even though that's a bonus action, I'm going to do it as a 5th-level spell. And I roll it? Okay. Well, then give me a bunch of d4s. I need one more. Great. Okay. Whoa, what the hell is that one? Ah, shit! What are these? I can never add d4. Wait, is it plus five, or is it plus five, five, five-- That was my bonus action. As my action action-- oh man, this is stupid. I lift my Hand Cone of Clarity, and I sing to Lady Delilah, (singing) Hey there, Delilah, won't you listen to me because I'm about to cast a spell on you. Ooh! Oh! (speaking) Okay, so I'm going to use Suggestion on her. This is so stupid! Well, it's 19. I'm suggesting that she has an unquenchable urge to make out with her husband. It is wisdom. She has a headache. Wait! I thought she was just a common guard! Skadoosh! Get out of there. As I see this going on, can I call out with Cutting Words to distract him? Okay. (singing) Distraction, distraction! Distraction! Distraction, distraction! What do I roll? Six. What are you doing to me? Are you dropping me? Here are some d4s. So you need one more, right? At level three? You're back. Straight towards what? Well good, I'm glad I'm tip of the spear now. Jesus. (laughs) How did that happen? Dice versus dice. Wizard versus wizard. What? There is no save. 30 days?! He doesn't even know what a day is! Oh. Hi. Oh. Hello. What a lovely dinner we had-- Lightning! (laughter) Wait, she rolled a one? Oh, so wait, I get to roll for damage now? It's a bunch of d6s right? 8d6. Can I arc it so it hits both of them? Would it also hit Mr. Awesome? Okay. 32? Wow, she can take half of half? I will move backwards. By a lot. And have I seen the tiefling? But I don't have eyes on her? So I can't inspire her? All right, well then, I will inspire Keyleth. (singing) Can you feel the blood tonight? That's it, that's all I got. (laughs) All right. So you're inspired. Her accent is so fake. Are you still in disguise? He still has disadvantage on attacks, right? That wore off? I have a 20. What do you want? What do you need? And you have inspiration. Make our leave? Wait! I turn to Vex. Vex, does your Hunter's Mark tell you where they went? They just disappeared. Where'd they go? That's okay, we'll just run. Trademark! Critical fail! And a tiefling. I've read about this. We bury him under the ground for five days and five nights, all will be better. Well, it could be. Could be kimchi. Either way, it will be very tasty. What's your name? Your real name. Are you a healer of some sort? And why did you infiltrate the castle? That's how the British people say it Aluminium. I am just looking at the symbol, I am not looking at anything else. What is that mark on you? The Broker? You helped us in battle. Do you need us to help hide you? An idiot. He's even more of an idiot. She's a common servant girl. She wouldn't lie! We'll take care of her for now. He seems totally normal to me. Seems like every day. Yep, that's pretty much basic him. No, we should haggle, don't you think? How much will it take to save our friends? Well, that's uncalled for. Oh. You're with us again. Oh, well, welcome back. How was it, being dumb? To what the water? Thank you for all your assistance. Did he tell us a price for fixing Vax? Our friend Pike would be much, much grateful for your service. And one more thing before we leave. If you need any items, be they gear or blades, go to Gilmore's! Gilmore's Glorious Goods! Today! We're supposed to plug him, right? I don't know. 25. There is a shop here! And you get ten percent off. Hey, oh, what was your name? For the next time we have a dead ally. Cleric Tristan? Thank you, Cleric Tristan. Blessed be Sarenrae's name. That was close. I saved your life. We'll track them down, we'll find them, we'll kill them, and seek revenge. You don't think we'll have to? They won't attack us! We're many, and they're few. We also need to protect our new friend, Lillith fair, over here. Well, she's white, so I thought maybe-- Yes, but we'll have to prepare ourselves for an attack or perhaps stalk them and kill them? And we have a guest. Do you need to run from the Broker, or can you stay with us for a few days? Not at all. Is that true? 19. Come on, Kit Buss! Come on, fuck him up! Kit Buss! All the dice! Much better. 38. 41. Me? Shit. Is that the old lady over there? Okay, I'll take a step towards her and I will try-- it's never worked for me, it probably won't work. I'll try Eyebite on her. What do I roll? I'm doing it through my Horn of Clarity or whatever. 19. Okay. I choose Sleep. (singing) Rock-a-bye, old lady. And then I'll just inspire our new tiefling friend with a little sexy dance. She's asleep. What are you going to do? Wait, what if Lillith is the bad guy instead of the good guy? Three more? That seems terribly unfair. Sorry, Doris. You'd better just lie down. You're in Atlantic City. Everything's okay. Wait, the guy in the mask is prone? I only get one 6th-level spell but it says on Eyebite that every subsequent action, I can do it again. I'm going to do it to her again. To the old lady again. Oh, are you going to hold? I'll just run up, as far as I need to be within 60 feet and do it again to her. Just fall asleep again. Back to sleep. Oh, and I'll inspire him. With a musical fart. (fart noise) Yes, thank you. I've fallen, and I can't get up! Listen, that's not just something I can do whenever. I have to be in the mood, I need music, some nice lighting, I need to be wined and dined a bit. This is the Broker? I'll take it. All right. You still have my inspiration. You can do anything. You could be President of the United States. I lick Tiberius. (laughter) It's still got some booze in there, if you want to take a slurp.
