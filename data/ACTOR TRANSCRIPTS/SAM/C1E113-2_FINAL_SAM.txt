No. Why are you Australian now? Skak, don't you have some sort of a crossbow? Maybe you should be the one to take him down. Oh, we could cause a diversion! Wait. If we make a noise or something, won't he wake up everybody else? Oh no. We're dumb. How far away is he? Crossbow him! Little pitchy. Are they up? Are they behind a wall? Below us! Oh, we're coming in from the mountain. So we can jump down. Well, it doesn't matter. Seven. I will jump on the weak one. Oh boy. Check? 15. d4, add strength. Three, plus strength is one. So four! I will take my quarterstaff and-- like churning butter. Good, because that was a two. And that's a natural 20! d8, seven, plus four. 11. 14 plus four is 18. Well, is he dead? Orc physiology is not my specialty. Do I see other orcs? Uruks, around me? I get one more attack, right? I will move to that one and hit him. Right? 40. Not with advantage? That's probably a miss. It's a nine. It's a wraith! It's a grave-walker! They can disappear at will! Thanks, Skak! Kill the other? There's two asleep. A good kill. Sucking somebody else's thumb! That's so gross! We'll catch you, just come down. Oh, wait! I have a blanket. Let's spread it out and we'll hold it, and you can jump down on the blanket. What's that all about? Oh, I know what it is. We're not to kill him? I will grapple him! Not good. Nine. That's right. This one is, it's an athletics check? 13. I will intimidate. Natural one. I guess we have to kill him. Pain? It's multicultural. Sure! I'll take out my length of chain and sort of start whipping him. We're looking for Ur-Gram. You do! Where's Ur-Gram? Soft-skin! Sure, sure, those are all good ones. Man-filth! Man-beast! Correct answer. Where is he? If we rest, what if they send a patrol up here? --the Fircs. I guess. Got to use them all. Back up at full. Lead us to Ur-Gram. Let him up. How do we get inside? Is there a password or something? You're big. No, we're not going to cut your head off! We're going to get a lot of money for this mission, and we'll give you one half. 15! Oh, I can fix it! I'm a medic. That's cocked. 11 plus medicine? 14. He needs to have a costume on, for the ruse. Remember, you're bringing us in because we're new recruits. You're here to see Ur-Gram. No questions. The moment you betray us, we will kill you. And that's it. All of us? 17 here as well. But do they have grog? Hide? No, we should sneak past them! Are we going to sit here? Why don't we try to go past them?! All right, I will stealthily see if I can see any caragors. Move out, look around. Ooh! 25! Hi! We need to distract them somehow. Does anyone have any meat on them? A bell? That would distract? Throw the bell! Oh, because you didn't play an orc in the game, so you don't know that these things are really powerful. I think we should try to run. Six. That's either a one or a 20. It's a 20! I'll choose dexterity, and that's a 21. Yes! You're so powerful. (growling) I will attack relentlessly! 23 to hit. That is five points of damage. I will use my Flurry of Blows. Got it. So, second attack doesn't hit. It's 12. So I can't use my Flurry of Blows? Okay! Flurry of Blows! That's worse. And 15. Eight! Plus four is 12 points of damage. Plus I will choose a condition for it. Strength saving throw? If it fails, no, it probably is strong. It's probably dextrous, too. I'm going to choose that it can't take reactions until the end of my next turn. Mozuu? Is our prisoner still around, or did he run away? Oh, perception! 21! I could catch him! I can! I'm going to sprint after him using Step of the Wind. I grab the top of his skull. Athletics? 17. Can't run from the Forcs! That makes sense. All right, we'll wait here for the others and then we follow this plan. You're on our side. I trust you implicitly. I don't worry about anything. I trust you implicitly. We are in this together 100%. Friends. Oh no! I can! I will use my medical kit to stabilize him! I pull out the arrow! No, don't do this to me! Come on, fight! You can come back! I spit into the wound, I close it with my hand. Nine. Bock! Bock-Bock! What's his name? Borg-Borg? Borg, I thought I had lost you. I don't know what happened. All I can say is I'm sorry and it will never happen again. Why did you do that?! He's our ticket in! LAURA and I think you can still trust us, all right? I have a robe. You have a bagpipe? I think we're good, let's just get on with it. Nothing. Or the back door. I think we should go through the back door. (laughter) Hey, shrak happens. Yeah, we'll go first. Right? You. Go through that shrak hole! We're stealthing? Nine. Bonk! Say something! Brick, say something! We work for Ur-Gram! Oh no. Five. Let's go through the shrak hole right away! Fast, charging in! That's why we have to go through the shrak hole, as fast as we can! How high is the wall, Matt? I'm going to jump up onto the wall. I'm going to use my step of the wind which doubles my jump distance. Distance, does that mean height? Four-- one. My strength modifier is one. Okay. (scoffs) Nine. To the shrak hole! It'll be okay. Shrak hole. Split the party? He's in shrak right now. I'm going to go in the shrak hole. I'm going into the shrak hole! Acrobatics. 19. (whispering) He's been chosen. Nine here. That hits, but I'll use deflect missiles. I reduce that by more than seven points. (catches bolt) (bolt whooshes) 16. I rolled a 16 plus I don't know. Oh. My dexterity is plus four. Eight plus four. You've shown yourself to be weak. (laughter) I look over at Arby, trying to get a sense of what-- is she on my side? (laughter) (sighs) This is not going to end well. Our leader, Barfta, told us if we found where they were, that would be a reward. I'm going to leave. (laughter) Everyone's turning into bad guys! That's right. Oh, I don't know what to do! I can't beat that guy. He's a wraith! I'm going to-- --spend my last ki point and run as fast as I can through the shrak. I will use my troll's endurance to reduce that by 11 points. I touch the arrow and I say, ugh! He's right. Forcs don't run. They stick in meat and they stay there forever. And I turn around and I run back into the shrak hole! (laughing) Natural 20. That hits, but I will catch that shit. I mean, catch that shrak and throw it back. It doesn't say I need ki! Oh, I see. I can catch it. I rolled 17. It's 1d10 plus nine. So I rolled an eight. Do I have enough movement to get under the shrak hole? I'm going to attack Mozuu. Or is the Bright-- I'll attack Mozuu. I choose Mozuu the Chosen. Mozuu! 20 to hit. Eight plus four. 12. A second attack. 11 plus seven. 18 to hit! Two plus four. So that's six more points of damage. Oh! One more hit. This is an open-handed hit, right? No good. That's a 13 to hit. Kill the tark! For the glory of the uruk! Is she dead? Dead dead? I don't think I have another resistance to this this time, I mean, is it cycled through again? It's not good. It's like eight. I resist 18 points of damage. I'm making a nice collection of your arrows. Yes. All right, Bright Lord, let's see what you got! Hi-ya! 13! Ugh! Nine! Bonus action! Oh! 18 plus seven, that's 25! Oh, you've got a mark on your face from my hand! Oh, it's a poo mark! That's the mark of the shrak! The shrak lord! One! Plus four, I guess? I mean, you got a 20! Yeah. So seven? But not as fun as the game that's coming out on October 10. It's called "Mordor, Mordor, Mordor."
