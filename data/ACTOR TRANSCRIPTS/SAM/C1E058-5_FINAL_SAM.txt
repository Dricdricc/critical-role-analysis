Go online now! (singing) One day left! To get a Joe Mad poster. We're going to burn the unsold ones. Just like us. Okay. Thank you to all of the fans, the Geek & Sundry fans, because together we raised $84,512.57 this weekend to support Muscular Dystrophy Association. You guys brought it. You kept bringing it. As promised, because we are oath keepers, we raised more than $75,000, therefore the Deadlands one-shot with some of the Critical Rollers will be posted online-- --is live already. Live, on geekandsundry.com. Oh, there's also still time to donate to the cause. There's a link in the chat, just click on it and keep donating. Let's get it over $100,000. Oh, wait, tickets are up now! TRAVIS and Buy tickets to see us live. To touch our bodies. Live. Critical Role Live! One night only! We should talk about this off the stream, but we should have an opening act, a warm-up guy! Right? We should get a stand-up or something. Maybe Hardwick will come over. (laughter) For every ten minutes that Laura does that, I will donate one dollar to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Are there more announcements? Liam's going to run the show! Is this the music you want playing? Great, it worked. Was not expecting this to be white. (laughter) You know what? It's worth it for number three. Felguard III! (laughter) By the way, this is a setting that everyone watching can identify with. You're on the Warner Brothers lot. Is he a quiet dog? All right, I'll take him and we'll hope that the director's cool with it. Can you do an Emma impression? I'm sorry about this, Gus. I'm in a pickle, and my friend left me this dog, and I don't want the dog to die, obviously. From what I've seen he's a pretty quiet dog. We've really grown quite close over the last few-- You know what, if I could take him in the booth with me, then Gus, if you're allergic you don't have to worry about it, it'll be near me, and that would be great. His name is Bixby. I'll take a tea. That's normal. (laughter) Did they not budget correctly for this? How's that bruise feel, for real? You should've trained, is what you should've done. Just that one? (sighs) Make hay while the sun shines, I suppose. And you have some sort of plan? (shushes) Bixby! Okay, got it. Make hay-- Pickup. Make-- (sighs) Pickup. Make hay while the-- Pickup. Make hay while the sun shines, I suppose, and you have some sort of-- Pickup. Make hay while the sun shines, I suppose. And you have some sort of plan? Sorry. I was distracted. Make hay while the sun shines, I suppose. And you have some sort of plan? They're rewriting something. They always rewrite something. I could probably do my line a little better. Feedback, or something. (slurred) Make hay while the sun shines, I suppose. And you have some sort of plan? We made different choices. (whispers) Take one was fine. You know, Pierce is fucking taking forever with this tea, also. I don't think he owns a car. He was back with the Starbucks? We whip out our fucking iPhones, and we start making phone calls. Did we sign our contracts, yet? (laughter) What do we do? Wait, are there currently Liams in the control room? (laughs) Trademark it. SAM and I'm going to assist. My character name is is Sam. Okay, this is good. With advantage? We can bust through the window. Bixby, get over here! That's a good roll! We're trying weird candy, too. Wait! Should we stealth? Let's stealth out of here. Do I have to roll for Bixby? I got a five. Bixby got a three. (laughter) Impassable? Maybe there's a vault down here. There's a lot of old vaults down here. You can't go over there. What if that thing grabs you? Should we create a diversion? What else do we have? A bow and daggers? I'll take the bow. Are there any arrows? How are we going to get past the big claw thing? What if it grabs one of us? I got a five. Ashley's here?! She's not working on this game! Maybe they were editing something from a previous game. We run towards the light. This is hell. For what? What are we rolling? Eight. You're going to OD on Advil. At summer camp. Yeah! How many arrows do I have? Yeah. Ooh! There's 25 arrows! I'm pretty bad. I can't kill the dog! I told my friend I would-- I will not take a shot at it. I will nock an arrow and be ready, but I will not provoke something that isn't threatening us. It's a block. Should be a block. Okay. I'm holding Bixby. I rolled a 19 for me and a three for Bixby. I'm proficient in stealth. Does that mean anything? This wasn't the thing you had prepared? He's rolling with us tonight. The whole map, and we just blew right past it. Hey, Laura, you know how beasts work. 17. Can I command the beast? Is that an action to command the beast? I'm a beastmaster ranger with a dog. Shit! When we were in the recording studio, I should have had advantage on everything because my favored terrain is recording studios. (laughter) Wait. The beast knows we're there and is eating protein right now. I'm going to-- wait, is that a pool? Okay. I'm going to set Bixby down and tell him to protect Laura. Well, she's a dainty girl. Not at all. (laughs) No. I set the thing down, and I take my bow and arrow, and I'm going to attempt to shoot the beast. I'm going to roll. I don't know what I add to it. Well, is it this plus four for the bow? Okay, so that's a 12. No. I'm a level-one ranger. Wait, I get movement still, don't I? I'm going to use my movement to run behind Taliesin. Plus six. The thing we're fighting cowered? You're grappled. I say, Bixby, go retrieve my arrow that I shot over there, and then I will nock another one. Am I too close to it to attack this? Okay. Well, then I'm going to step out from around Taliesin so I got a good shot. Am I in danger of hitting Travis? Okay, so I will fire again. Okay. What do I add, plus four? 20. I look at Laura. See? I'm good. Is he drowning? Okay, I'll use my movement to retrieve Bixby. I'm a beastmaster. I command beasts. It's dead. We know this, right? Oh shit. What is that move? Is it a blue Prius? We've got to go find Ashley! But the tower's only one leg. We can't climb one leg of a tower. You can certainly have a go, was that it? You are pretty big. I'm going to tell Bixby hey, Bixby. Hey, buddy. Can you watch our back, and if anything comes, bark? I think he understood me. Just stay. Stay and watch. I'm not going to let her go up there by herself! Take your phone and text us! Well, maybe text still works. And now an animal handling check! (laughter) Where? And what do you want us to do? Bixby! Bixby, come! I'm sorry, boy. Yeah, so maybe we go up? Can we go across the rooftops? Did you see? Did you see a way? A path? So we can just walk across the rooftops? Towards the cafeteria. Wait. From our vantage point does it look like Warner Brothers Studios is the epicenter of this or can we see parts of Burbank and television city? But does it seem to be originating from here? Is it just everywhere? (laughs) God, he really is dumb. All right, I'll start going across the rooftops or whatever. I'm holding him. I promised my friend that I would take care of him this weekend. A promise made is a promise kept, Travis! As we go, I turn to Travis and say, hey, man, listen. Just level with me. This was a single-scale session for me. Are you getting double-scale? Yeah. Are they paying you more than me? Come on, just level with me. I asked my agent. She said it was most favored nations. I need that money! I just value my talents as much as yours and I think I should be compensated just as much. Yeah, of course. How close are we, at this point? We've got to climb down? And do we have to traverse ooze to get to it? There's vines, Travis. Okay, but before we go, Laura, grab that dagger of yours. Why don't you cut off that vine? That way we'll have at least a rope we can use for something. Okay. That's six feet, right? Eight feet? How long's this vine that we can cut down here? Natural 20. (oohing) I'm carrying the dog. Do you want to rest? Take that back? You're going to need that hit point. You want to take a little rest? If we rest, you might feel one point better. Wait, did you take some damage back there? Maybe we should rest for a second. Yeah! That was back. So wait, there's no ooze? What, are we going to make a raft or something? Laura, I'll give you a piggyback ride, and I'll carry this dog at the same time. I'm 19. I got 19. They're on my back. I'm carrying Laura. Laura's got the dog. You're stealing my dog? Laura, where are you going? I am going to follow them. Quite quickly. He just had tentacles shoot out of his arm. He's fine. None of our phones are working anymore? Wait, did we jump four years into the future? Not with the show. Are there monsters attacking you? Was that a Snapchat filter? What was that? How did she do that? Much less than 24 hours. So we're in the cafeteria. Oh no, the radiation again. Ashley said to go to the tower. She tried! She took military showers! Maybe they're not fully formed yet? Maybe this is where they're born! Wait, was Liam ever Liam? It's dead Conan O'Brien? Oh, it's Liam O'Brien and Conan O'Brien! What are those things down there? Is that wreckage? Do they make a Conan mini? I turn to Travis and say, dude, are you making one-and-a-half scale? Just tell me. Is it close to what I'm getting? It's higher than that? Can you talk to somebody about it for me? All right, let's go kill this thing. Does it see us? Are we stealthing? Oh, okay. Eight. Bixby takes my initiative. Oh boy. Cast?! Taliesin, what are you talking about? But that thing's magic. You're a voice actor. How many daggers do you have left? I tell the pug to go find that dagger. And then I will turn. Do I have a shot at Travis's Liam? Okay, I'll take a couple steps, nock my arrow, and say, watch your backs! Travis, watch your six! That's what they say in games. And I'll turn the bow like this, sideways. And I'll fire! Pug life. 16, that's a 20. What do I roll? It just says plus two. Seven. You didn't get a shot at him. I'm sorry, buddy! But these are fun. Oh no. 12. I know Liam too well! I know all of his moves! No save, no nothing? With Advil-tage. How's the pug doing? Is he getting closer to the knife? Great. There's a guy right next to me, isn't there? Yeah, he's flanked by an ally. This is the thing you try to pull all the time. Okay, I'll lean down and grab the dagger. Flick it to Laura. And then I'll look up to Conan O'Brien, and I'll draw my bow and arrow, and I'll look for that red mane of hair. I'll just fire one straight at it. Yes! That is a 23! Oh, it's an eight, plus two is ten points of damage! You're a hack, Conan, a hack! Your best days are behind you! Bixby, throw your body in front of it! I've got some good spells, just ask me! Oh shit. Maybe he is. How do you know it missed? I didn't roll or anything. Okay! Nice. Sorry Bixby. Just throw the sword? Wait, oh. Are there no more O'Briens? But wait, are there bad guys that haven't gone? They haven't had turns in a while. 12. Okay. Let's see. Do I have a clear shot at the last-- is there one remaining Liam? Okay. I'll scoot over a couple paces. Actually no. Sorry. I won't shoot at that one because I got to leave something for you guys to do. I'll shoot at Conan again. So I will fire another one right at Conan. All right. Okay! 17. In your face. Another eight plus two is ten! One? Finger of Death. He loves casting spells. He knows how to do it well. Yeah, I bought them for you guys! What's that one? No, I'm so curious! I'll take a bite of Zagnut. No save? I can't halve it with some sort of constitution save or something? It just happens. I'm now where I was before I got the 25 hit point boost. 11. Damn. You're going to pay for that, Conan O'Brien. It has a range of 30. You could stand on the dog and get another foot. That's almost ten feet. There's a car. You can jump up on the car. Yeah, you want to try this Big Hunk, by the way? Here, Travis. Every time, it's a guilt trip. We've got to get him down. Sure it was. All right. I'm going to start heading towards the tower with all of my movement. And for my attack, I command Bixby to attack Travis. And I say to Travis, I am worth than you, motherfucker. I should be getting double scale. I have more experience, I have more nuance. You can do one thing big, beefy characters, and that's it. Oh no. More Liams! Oh god, again?! I am unconscious. As I fall, I say, you did this, Travis! You have my life on your conscience! Wait, do I make a death saving throw? I don't know how this works! Next round. I was your only ranged attacker! But wait. Wasn't he at disadvantage for other things? What are you going to do? In my frozen state, I say, mouth to mouth! (laughter) That's your whole turn? (strained) Mouth to mouth! Wait, I'm far away from Travis! Hey! My dog gets an attack of opportunity! No, fails? No, my arm. Blame my agent. (strained) Mouth to mouth! Oh, thank god! Oh, but those were temporary hit points from Ashley, right? Ooh! So I'm at 30. God, Matt's so powerful. What, did they bamf out? Oh! That hits? I have an arm again? Damn, that Matt is so powerful. He needs to be nerfed. Am I too close for a ranged weapon attack? Not knowing what's going on with Laura, I'll use my movement to quickly give her mouth to mouth. Because I think she's frozen. She might be hyperventilating. It's a natural one. (laughter) (moaning) Ow! Braces, what? Invisalign? Whoa! (laughing) In what manner would you like to kill this? Put it on a shirt. Just say, more like Conan O'Dyin'. I don't know. Wait, can't liches get back up again? It is going to heal itself? But that's it. We did it. Wait, what? Huh? I don't know. Sorry, someone told me I had some Zagnut in my teeth. We can all fit here. Let's see how this live show goes. -- getting double scale for this? I'm a little older than that. Apparently, they undid that. I never asked for it to be undone. I look like I am around your guys' age. They do age differently. They are on a slower scale than you guys. You guys are half-elves, so you're only barely different. So if you're 27 years old, that means that you guys are teenagers. Yeah, but if you're 27-year-old half-elves, do you look like you're 18-year-olds? We are working on that game. Emma is real. Warner Brothers Games is a game place where we record much. Pierce is awesome. If you could play as another character of Vox Machina, body switch for a day, who would it be? I think I would, if I could switch characters, well, Grog is pretty fun, man. It's a pretty fun character, and he does big damages and stuff. Yeah, I think Grog. It's fun to be dumb. I have a team of writers. (laughter) That is so flattering. Could "possibly do something cool for you guys" mean give Travis a starting lineup on the Titans for one game? Maybe preseason game? You played some ball. If you were given the shot, just one shot, you get one play, what position are you going to play, defense/offense? So you're blocking. It said, how much do the Giants, Washington's team, and the Eagles suck? I refuse to say the name of Washington's team. Question. Liam, what was your inspiration for this story? Have you seen it yet? How much time do I spend on my goblet? I spend one minute before the episode gluing something to the bottom, and it's whatever I can find lying around that day. (giggles) Not a fair question. Neither are useful. They are just energy sucks. I have a newfound respect for Laura, having just played a beastmaster ranger. It's tough to have this stupid animal around all the time that you have to deal with who can't really do anything and could die at any minute! I know! But it's hard to do that. I have a newfound respect for you. I still don't like Trinket. Question. Who does Pike like? We don't know! You know?! How do you know? Because Ashley told you or because Pike told you? On the airship? You're the captain. Titty Ruxpin is the worst porn, by the way. I would be cabin boy. Wait, is that what we established? You're cabin boy or I'm cabin boy? I'm cabin boy, and you're the captain. Someone wants to know, Travis, what class were you in the game we just played? Fighter. I do not say pick up in my real life. Pick up! I didn't know stealing was bad! Why do people want to send me money? Oh. Oh yeah. This guy says 50 or so tickets remain. 11 VIP and 56 general tickets remain. Les Mis, but there's other ones that are good, too. Was there anything on your character sheets tonight that you did not get to do, but wish you had done? That wasn't on your sheet, was it? I have favored terrain of voiceover booths and I didn't get to use it. From the Twitter? Checking it out. #CriticalOBrien tag. Here we go. Question. If your character could get the kill on any one of the dragons, which one would you want it to be on and why? Wait, green dragon's the dickish one, right? That's a great question. There's so many great submissions that we could not sort through them all this week, so we're moving it to next week. There's some amazing designs! What are all these baby questions for? I disagreed completely. He was so good. Great job prepping, Liam! It's similar to if you watch a lot of porn, does that desensitize you to-- I think the answer's yes. Why did Conan choose you? You can answer that? How's this going to work? We do the show, and then the VIPs can stick around after the show? Wow! This is going to be so much fun! Do I get to wear makeup on stage? And if it doesn't go well, they can put Civil War up and everyone gets a nice show. Matt does some scares in every episode. We should not have done that. There was a question-- shit, I've already forgotten it. Yeah, and I got to Liam and he jumped off the fucking ledge out of range of all of my spells and any help I could have given! There was one question earlier that said, Laura and Travis, how did it feel RPing as a couple tonight? No. I have a lot of great nuggets from the past. But you and me have some-- we had done some screen acting as children. I have a Pizza Hut commercial that I'm quite proud of. Where I was the dweeb. Cousin Norman the Nerd. Google it now. Yep, Hot Cheeto's up there. Sure. That is true. We don't know. I had no idea I had a daughter! I had no idea. That changes all kinds of things for my guy. I just dumped Pike. I dumped Pike. Who knew that was going to happen? She was pretty broken up over it. New York Comic Con, are we going back to New York Comic Con? We went last year. Let's start combining them. Do you guys watch the live show TPK character-- If you could have one thing answered about the current campaign from Matt Mercer, what would it be? What are you dying to know that he hasn't told us yet? I feel that drive to know. I want to know anything. Has Matt ever had to crash with one of you guys because Marisha got mad at him after a game? Am I a joke to you? That is not a good question to end on. Man, so many. Trying to bone my daughter. That's a good one. Ninjas. Can you close out the night with your patented phrase?
