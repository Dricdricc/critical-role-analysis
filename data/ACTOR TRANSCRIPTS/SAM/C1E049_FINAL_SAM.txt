Yeah, that can't happen. No way. Oh shit, it's in my car. It's okay. I'm good. It's literally in my other car. But I have my PDF. I play Zedd in the Ratchet and Clank game that just came out. It's a good game, it's getting good reviews! I haven't seen what I did in it, but I assume it's nerdy. Bluetooth?! Put your weed in there. Which is it? Which is it? Three. Milking a cow. 15. Wait. What is our overall goal here? Are we to slay a bunch of orcs or are we to follow them somewhere? Okay, well let's follow silently. Then we won't know where the camp is. Oh. Can you? They were just hunting. Let's follow them. (whispers) I don't know. Whoa! It's a cozy camp. There's fire, there's bears. Oh, there's the guy hanging up in the tree! Okay. We have options, people. Can we rest? Are we rested? Yeah, we had a night in the-- wait, no. We just killed those-- Okay, so we're down a couple spells, or whatever. Yeah. Okay. Hey, oi! So do I create a distraction while you go around back? Do we go in guns blazing? What's the plan? I can distract. So a distraction that would get everyone to run towards me and ignore you? Sure. Sure. I'll draw them away from the tents. No. That is for my recreational use only. Also takes a minute to cast. Interesting idea. It's an interesting idea. I like it too. It's not concentration. I mean, it's concentration for a minute, but then after it's cast, it's okay. But we still have to get them out of the camp and into the door, unless I make the door in the camp. I can't do both. I'm fine with distractions, but I can't go to the back of the camp and set a door and to the front of the camp and draw them out. I'm really good at distractions. So I'm to sneak in and make a door and await further instructions? How far away are we? But we're talking like 150 feet? 200 feet? Okay, well, we're fine. I can make the door from 300 feet away. So we're fine. So I can make the door right now before we do anything. Except there's going to be a glowing door in their camp. All right. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and do it. All right, flank around, flank around. It's going to take me a minute to cast the spell. You have a minute to get into position. Oh, she's not a good sneaker. I'm staying next to Keyleth because I can do this from a range. Wait, don't do the distraction yet! I haven't set the-- I'm right next to you. We want to do it-- We want to distract around here. No, he knows. We're back right now, but that's where we will end up. I'm going to start casting the door. And I'm going to do it back behind camp, on the treeline or whatever. You know, just out of eyeshot of them. Do you want me to go in and you can cast something? I'll get their attention and you can cast something? Okay. There's not many that you can conjure. It's pixies and little things. It's okay, she knows what she's doing. No, she doesn't. No, there's not. I will say this, to be fair to Marisha, the spell does say, your DM will have a list of the creatures. (laughter) It does, at the end of the spell. It says the DM will have the creatures. Centaurs are not fey, are they? Front and center. See this, Matt? Oh shit! Yeah. Good job. 15, but it doesn't matter. I'm walking forward. I'm going to cast the Resilient Sphere on myself. And I'm going to roll into camp. Hamster-style. Don't. I'm going to start singing to get their attention. (sings 'Tro-lo-lo') Very stupid. You did great! You exposed the trap! You saved-- If I had just gone out, I would have fallen in the hole! 11. We're still trying to draw them out, right? Oh shit. We healed up each other. Oh no, is he going to crush the dryad? He died? Those seem like opposite commands. He just got up. Did the two that were on me attack? Can I act like they're hurting me? Ugh! Ah! Ooh! Oh! Deception? 27. (sounds of pain) (sounds of pain) Yeah, it's my turn. No, no, it's bottom of the round. I'm the last guy and then you. Oh shit, do I keep them here, or do I go to work? Okay, I'm going to very quickly drop the orb and Dimension Door into one of the tents. I had wanted to go to not the one that Laura was saying, the other one. That's the one I was going to go to, because it's closer to the door. Are they human? Or are they dancer? I say, come with me if you want to live. And do I have any movement? Can I try to unbind them? Okay, that's what I'll do. We did. Ooh. Stage right. Oh, snap. Oh boy. Well, maybe it's another spell or something, yeah. Have I freed them from their shackles? Okay. The construction of the tent, can I lift up the back and shuttle them out that way, or do I have to cut through it or anything? I don't want to waste too much time in there. You know what, I'll walk them out the front door, point them towards the mansion. And say run, do not walk, to my beautiful, beautiful house. To the right, stage right when I get out? Just enough to get them around the tent, yeah, and on their way. And I yell to them, wipe your feet before you go in! (laughter) That's pretty much all I can move, you think? Okay. Do I have a bonus action? All right. I will-- I can only really see Keyleth around, right? Everyone else is hiding? I will inspire Keyleth as my bonus action, I will sing to her, (singing) her blood runs cold, her memory has just been sold, my druid is a centerfold, druid is a centerfold. I don't know. (laughter) That's it. 47. Ow! Sure we are. Don't hit me. I don't think he can understand you, Grog. Oh. Yeah, we need to know, wait. Does he know anything else? Is there another camp, is there anything? They just had some prisoners? Yeah, sphinx? Yeah, I'm in the other tent untying them. Calming them down, looking for loot. Wilhand? Oh, the town. We were in the camp. Okay. It's fine. They'll have a good night's sleep. Did you have to use your dagger at all? There's a couple boars, right? That's true. How about the casks, what's in the casks? We should take that, and wait, this meat, don't we have a cold bag? Don't we have a cooler? Let's keep some meat. Keep some grain and meat or something. Wait, the sun is setting, are we taking a short rest or a long rest? Are we spending the night? Of course we can, yeah. Are we going to spend the night? What time is it? Oh, little early. Are we going up to the mountain? All right. Do we need to scout up? How far to the mountaintop? Or the glowing place. We should go check it out before we go to bed, swing by on a broom or something. I'm going to go with her. You're going on the broom? Yeah, I'm going to turn into a mangy crow that looks like it would be with a witch. I'll Polymorph. And I perch on her shoulder. (crow sounds) Thank you! Wow. Thank you. Mine sucks. Natural one. You're in the air, though. (crow sounds) I don't know, can I understand her? I'm just fucking with her, then. (laughter) (caws) Might be fun. Sure. (caws) Okay, I'll fly in. I have darkvision, I don't know what crows have. I don't know what a crow has. Are they daytime birds? They're daytime birds. They're not owls. Shit. You can do that too? Quick, do a nightingale. So I'm just flying around in the dark knocking into things. Ow! Ooh, stairs. I'll break form and come back as Scanlan. Natural 18. (laughter) It just says darkvision. I didn't write down the distance. 60 feet. I'll write it down for the future. Wow, I've always wanted that to happen. Can I see down the blue thing? I don't want to go to where the blue is, I just want to see if I can peek down there? I'm going to die. I'm going to shoot one single Magic Missile into the space. Okay. I quickly pee a little on the side of the wall, just a little bit, okay. Zip up, turn into an owl and get outta there. At level five, because I'm out of level four. (confused hooting) Oh yeah. What? Yes, and they have a mapmaker with them, so they'll find it without a problem. Eventually. But right now, just go to your-- Nope, missed it. Did you have trouble sleeping? Sand pit? I have a bedroom for you. Oh Grog, you have your own bedroom upstairs. It's got a giant-sized bed in it. Oh, for crying-- I spent minutes thinking about conjuring that. Whispers! I don't know what products we're selling currently, but I assume there are some. Oh wow! The preorder shirts? 50th episode. There's going to be special giveaways. I don't know. Is that true? I don't know. There's a triangle, seems to be Ioun-based. Smells of urine inside, it's very weird. Ooh, sorry. I forgot. Well actually, no, I don't know what you're talking about. Okay. Sure, no problem. The Frostweald. Sig-il. I did not check for traps, I just flew in, but perhaps we should this time. If you'll check for traps. Yes, let's do it. I will also check for traps. 22. 22. 22. I got a 24. Gnome and Common. You can't see nothing. Oh yeah, yeah. The chunk, the hunk. Five minutes! Piranhas, that's why. Are we diving into water or parted water? I'll take Pike and go after her. Not well. Slip-and-slide? There's a rock. Aren't there four dragons? Why not? Four somethings in the room. Elements. By the way, Matt, I rolled my second natural one of the night for my intelligence check. I'm trying to get water out of my ear. Wait, what are the other elements? Fire, air? She's an earth elemental, or she can do earthy things. If the sand fills up, we can ride the sand up to the hole. Yes, I can yell. I'm okay. The hole, is it triangular? I guess I'm climbing the rope. There's a rope, yes? Climbing that rope. Okay. 17. 13. This is an athletics check? 17. The tunnel on top? Pike? Don't do this, Pike, don't do this. I think we did do what we were supposed to do. We're in a room with two doors? Is that it? We haven't gone through fire or wind yet. Is it the exact same in both doors? Not a mirror image, not one blue one green? Okay. Should we open a door? Maybe there's a clue in here. Yeah, but what's that going to do? "All realms are the shore. The sky is a window, the water a door." And do what? Which door? Is there any way to cross the room without touching the web? You want to start cooking here? Oi? Oi, yes. It's like the one that we saw before. Of course I have my doohickus. You realize that I was born to shove things in holes. All right, so which one? I'll choose the right one and I'll stick my Ioun stone in it. Well, let's go up there and check it out. I don't think anything's going to want to talk to us down here. If we go to the right or the left, we have to cross these webs? Or no? Why don't we each take a direction? Wait, I could just bamf over to the other side. Should I just do that? Yeah, I'll Dimension Door to the platform on the other side. Hello. Osysa sent us. Fuck. 17. Whoa, that's lit, it's lit up! How did you do that? He hasn't attacked us. Atreyu. Four. Me too? I get rid of those. I will face the sphinx and say is your name Ioun? Sure, we all do. I mean, I'm not going to attack this thing if it hasn't attacked me yet, so I'm going to, eee. Can I hold my attack until a trigger? Or hold my action until a trigger? If he makes a move towards me physically. Is this magic? Do I get advantage on that? Advantage versus magic on saves. It says, Gnome Cunning, advantage on wisdom, character, intelligence, magic saves. That's what I wrote down, anyway. It doesn't really matter, I rolled shit on both, so it's okay. Don't bother. Seven. Okay. Just going to hit it? What if it's a nine-point hit point? Oh, well if, at the end of the round, have I not gone yet? Can I go? Yeah, I mean, I guess I'll attack at this point. I'll try something that will definitely fail. I will try and fail to put him into the Resilient Sphere. Which I'm sure will fail. (laughs) Well, I don't have my stuff with me. Through the hand cone? It's 20 now, yeah. But I have disadvantage on attack, but that doesn't matter. Okay. Can I ask him if his name is Earned? Okay, that's a stupid question, sorry. I don't know Celestial! It says, "That guy's name is Paul." Is this a saving throw? And do I still get advantage or no, because the first time it's cast. 12. Are we time bandits now? Is that what's happening? 20. Liar. That sounds cool. Oh boy. We'll be making an appearance-- Guys, we're going to die because we can't think of the name Steve. Test them out. What? K-A? What does that mean? What? What does that mean? What? You got part of the name? Part of the name. Which water did you go in? Okay. Well, shit. I want to go diving, but I don't think I'd make it over there. Shit. For now, I'll just-- someone else is going to do the water thing, I assume? I'm going to, I will attempt to cast Eyebite on the sphinx. Yeah. Wisdom. What a dick. What a dick. Well, I can't do anything else, so I will-- hi. Who's around? Who's about to do something? I'll turn to Vax and inspire him. That's it. I'll say, (singing) You are not throwing away your shot, you are not throwing away your shot, you're just like your sister, you're young, brooding and hungry, and you're not throwing away your shot. (laughter) I'm going to use Cutting Words. To get out of it. I'm going to blow my shawm. (high-pitched lip whistle noise) (laughter) He's still going to hit me. A d10. By eight. 16. Whispers. Oh my god. Oh wait, we got to jump into all these things? Mississippi. No, you've got to go for the water. K-A-J-I? Where's the wind one? Okay. What else can we plug? Be sure to follow us at @CriticalRole. @CriticalRole is on twitter. Kajimal. Kajimal. His name's Michael Jackson. No worries. I didn't need to live anyway. All the vital stuff's below the belt. I'm all right. Totally fine. Oh no, that's true! Two sticks and a snake. Cake and a rope. Check out our 50th episode next week, guys, with special guests Vin Diesel-- He's gone. God. It's fine. Did you get any of his name? I'm going to Counterspell that. Don't know why. Jesus. I mean, I wrote down crazy things, but it says at level four, roll plus five, versus ten plus level. I don't even know what that means! Okay. So I have to roll? Ability check at disadvantage. Yeah, that's not going to happen. Well, that would've worked. The first one was an 11 plus five. She's Pike! Can I roll to see if I'm fearful? Okay. Then I'm going to, as a bonus action, cast Healing Words on myself. I'll heal myself at level two. 2d4 plus five. Okay. Seven points, great. And then for my action I'll Dimension Door into the tornado. Dammit. Great. That's my action and my bonus. I have no movement. I'm gonna just do this. Wait, the first time was 25 years? Well, I'm floating to my death, so. Don't worry, I still have my lips. (blows whistle) (laughter) Well, as much as I appreciate the gesture, I'm going to try to Dimension Door out of here. Can I grab the door? Bonus too? All right. Do I have time to assess and see that she's dead? I will heal her. Healing Word at level-- I don't have many levels. At level three. I roll? 11. We'll find out later. 21. Do I also have to roll for fear? Oh yeah, they're deaf. Ever? What was his name again? Don't we get something out of this? I mean, sure, if you're getting rid of it anyway. What? Yes, yes. Let's go there! Well, I guess I'll have to take it. Hey, the White Duke!
