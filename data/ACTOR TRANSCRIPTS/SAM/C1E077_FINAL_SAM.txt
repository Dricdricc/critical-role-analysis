Guys! Loot Crate has a brand new theme for December, Revolution! They're always watching, they've designed a system to keep you down, they're meddlesome, it's time for a revolution! Here's the thing. Every week I do these sort of funny bits about Loot Crate. This week, it's going to be hard for me, because-- to get real with you guys for a second-- my son, this morning, at his preschool they found that his pre-school's bunny has deceased. (sympathetic noises) So it's here. Because this makes the bunny sort of part of the show. And the kids and the parents helped a little, they wrote a little something to commemorate the bunny and I'm going to read that for the kids. For the kids! What can be said about Dennis the Hopper? The bestest bunny the Little Explorer's classroom ever had, the way he always jumped left paw first, or nibbled on Olivia's Yo Gabba Gabba backpack? The way he pooped whenever Maddie picked him up. We'll miss your floppy ears, your soft fur, but most of all, your inner beauty. Love, the Little Explorers Maddie, Olivia, Salinger, Paris, Justice, Woodley, Appalonia, DeGrass, Garvey, Barack, Sashimi, Neptune, Sevigny, Coachella, Aaliyah, Walnut, and Kevin. And now to honor their request to make the bunny part of Critical Role forever, I'm going to-- We'll miss you, Dennis. Little long. (laughter) Does that go on your car, what is that? Did we show this yet? Guys, I'm going to keep the box in case the preschool's parrot dies. Whoa! He put a ring on it?! Why did you bring it home? But instead-- I have a bag of dice in there that I've never used. Could you do a wedding there if you wanted to? Or a bar mitzvah, or maybe a bris? All right. Who safe? The place is on fire. They're not safe. Ah! Wait! You forgot your hat! Because they saw you. Oh my god. We have to get these boys to safety. Or go anywhere. So they're gone forever. Hundred! Is that true? I missed that one. (laughing) That's more than two. All right, let's just charge in blindly! There's no cover out here, right? Let's take out those fucking riders. Can I extend my arm, with my Wand of Fireballs ready to shoot? How far are they? It's, like, blue and purple. Can I take my Fireball shot? I will take my Fireball wand shot. It's got a DC of 15, that wand. Can I fire more than one charge, or should I have said that already? Never mind. So, it's 8d6, right? 33. Also, Matthew, I don't know if this affects anything. I am exhausted. Does that change anything? So much math! Where's Elle? Oh, disadvantage. Oh, okay. 14. Tall cup of Travis' ass. 19 on the Spire?! Damn! 8d6. Radius 20. Is that true? There's another six up there, the red one. How far? Can I shoot him with lightning? I mean, that's a 100-foot range. He's a bad guy? He's on a bad wyvern, right? This is a bad guy. I'll take my clothes off. If it'll inspire us. It's on. (laughter) Oh, man! If I died in this shirt, it would be the worst way. (laughter) I wish I could do what Travis can do with his pecs, but I-- (laughter) He's a bad guy, right? I mean, we can kill him, right? Oh, 11. What are you restraining? Huh, why is he here? Odd. Yes, you also said ten, 120, 180 and 50. No, 8d6. Cocked. It was a four. (sings) I take six steps back. (singing) We go together because-- Oh, sorry. (laughter) Oh! I'll move forward with the rest of the gang, if I can. I don't know. I'll Lightning Bolt the wyvern up there who was holding the elf. Not knowing what he is or if he's good or bad. That would be 19, since I didn't call it. Okay. 8d6? Wow! 37! Oh, I will also inspire Vax with a dirty limerick. So, this is a random-- There was a young lady named Spruce/ whose favorite thrill was a goose/ Just the sight of a thumb/ made her tuchus all numb/ and her bowels got excited and loose. Let that story inspire you, Vax! Don't be loose like her bowels! Be firm like a mighty oak! (laughter) I'll Cutting Words this one. Oh wait! No, no. That hits. No, I think I only have a plus two if I-- No, I think it's a straight 14 because I don't wear anything anymore. Yeah. I think I'm at 12, plus the armor that I'm wearing is plus two, so. But I said I was going to Cutting Words it, which probably should help. Eight. Oh! As I look at him, I-- shit! I-- Ah! I just show him my chest hair. I tuft it out into a quick little ponytail. I only spent one on the last battle. I did a bunch of reactions last battle, but I only used one inspiration last battle. Oh, it does? Then this is five. I used three Cutting Words last time, and one inspiration. So this is five. And I think I have six total? No? That's six. So yeah, I have one more. I am. Yeah. They're muscular. Svelte. Frenzy. Rage. Doing the math? Oh boy. You have inspiration. Sure. That's large! That's like from a different set of action figures. We need some sort of miracle here! What we need is some sort of miracle! (singing) We need a hero! You can't do that! That's not one of your spells! You know, it's fine. Matt will just point at random until he finds the spot that you're looking for. Tidal Wave! Extinguished. How many guns you got? Oh yeah, use the battlefield! I'm going to move over to the right, towards Grog, a bit. Just to get away from everybody else. And I will-- We need to hit this giant, right? So I will (sings) Bigby's Hand! But I have very few spell slots left, so it's going to have to be at level seven. I will punch him in his giant solar plexus. Her! Her giant solar plexus. It's a she. Okay. With my hand cone, if that helps. Oh! Because it's a melee attack-- spell attack? 21. Yes, it's 8d8. Do you have any d8s over here? Okay. Oh wow! That's all of them. That's eight. 40. You know me well. Is anyone within range of my Healing Words? Keyleth's hurt, right? Okay. I will give her some Healing Words. I will heal you with my words. So that's 2d4 plus six, right? Wow, awesome. Eight. (laughter) Oh no. (whispers) Wait a second, you can't do that! I don't think you can command someone to hurt themselves. Really? Controversial spell use over here-- Controversial! It will be addressed on Talks Machina! If I were DM-ing-- Ooh, yeah! Can you use four 3rd-level spells to be one 12th-level spell? (laughter) Go away. It's our guy. Vex is working with them! Kill her. (laughter) General Grievous. I take a few steps towards Grog, if I can. Over to my left a little bit, just so I could get a clear shot-- Sorry, other left. So I get a clear shot on the fire giant. With Bigby's Hand, I'm going to do the Sugar Ray Leonard thing where it's going round and round and round, but before he punches, I'm going to fire a Lightning Bolt at it. 8d6. 24. So, the initial spell was level seven, but subsequent actions-- Really? So it's another 8d8? Okay. Oh yes, roll d20, right, this is a spell attack. Whiffed. A natural one. Oh boy. That was less Sugar Ray Leonard and more just, like, Sugar Ray. (laughter) (singing) Every morning when I wake up. (laughter) Oh! Great! I mean, she's coming for me, so I'll just back up ten feet. Disadvantage on ability checks, not saves. 11. Heavy duty. d12s! Wow. Oh shit. I would like to Cutting Words the first one. I'll save it for that one. Sure. That hits. Well, I Cutting Words that one. So I'll sing at it (singing) I don't want to die! Get your wings off me baby, get your wings off me baby. I don't want to die. All around the world! Only a seven. That's my AC. No problem. High. Constitution? 18. In addition to what you already said, 11 and 11? So 12 more. So wait, that's two concentration rolls? 17 plus something. Natural 20. Two natural 20's! Sure, sure. Yeah, it hits. Another natural 20. The other one was a three. Three and a 20. It's going to be like a million points of damage. This is a fun game. I'm up? Okay. My Bigby's Hand is still working, right? I can move it, how far? Move it up to 60 feet. Is that going to get back to me in time? I want it to do a 60-foot punch on the wyvern in front of me. Okay. Oh wait, I have to do a spell attack first. No! 15. So then, oh, it's a lot. It's already up to 26. Oh. 42. I might need it. Flank me! We're going into battle! So I'll-- I still have an action, right? I should probably heal myself, right? Nah. I'll run toward the fight. Oh wait, there's a wyvern right there, isn't there? Ooh, I don't want them to kill me. All right, I'll attack the wyvern next to Marisha's ass. I mean, Keyleth's ass. With another Lightning Bolt. I have one more level three spell. Okay. So 8d6. I got it. 23. And then I use my movement to grab both of the guards and cower behind them. Close them like a door in front of me. Ashley Johnson! No break tonight, guys. Kaboom, kaboom, ka-blow. Is anyone out there who wants to kill me? You two go kill that guy, I'll go somewhere else! Defenestrated. (laughter) You got this. We need a pause. That's the one that I have. I'll search the giant. I got nine. I'll take that. Oh, is that true? I printed some extras for you, Matt. Like, sign them for fans... it's high derp. Bad News. Cool, man. Can it hold a gallon? No, no, it doesn't affect the power of the spell. It doesn't make it a more powerful spell. What body? What are we asking this guy? What are we asking? Who would he trust? Yeah, sure, or I could make someone who we know talk-- No, but I mean, I'm saying-- who would he trust? I can make that person, and I can make that person talk. Let's build a game show set. He'll think he's on a Japanese game show. (laughter) Do we know anything about his family? Because we could always play bad cop, too, and threaten his family. All right, so what are we asking? What are his weaknesses? Has Thordak had a visit from Greenie? Raishan? We're up to 20 questions, now? (quietly) Persuasion check! Traverse Junction. We've heard of that before. Well we want to know who Thordak trusts and we want to know who Thordak doesn't-- Anything else? Allies? I don't think he's going to talk anymore. We should kill him. We should not leave them again. Did anyone escape the fight to go report back to home? So does the plan stay the same? Zenith. They said the scouts spotted us. Wait, what? No. Wait, what? Is that true? Yeah, to us. That's fine. Well, where else are we gonna meet? They don't have to go through, they can go around it; they're not idiots. On the outskirts of Emon. So we're gonna march all the troops out of here. Remember that the original plan was for Thordak to know where we were, and send Raishan to kill us. All of your goals? We need to meet up with Raishan. We need to find a rally point. She was coming back there, right? Should we march these 55 blokes to the south while we go to Whitestone? I'll stay and march the troops while you guys go back to Whitestone. I think the 55 will be okay if we send them off into the wilderness. No matter what, there's not gonna be another attack on Daxio in the next 24 hours. So we can go back to Whitestone, we can spend the night here and then go back, or go back now and spend a night and then bamf right back before there's any attack. To Whitestone? Get info, come back tomorrow if we need to. The mansion, sure. Unless we spend the night here first before going to Whitestone bright and early in the morning. We need to rest anyway. I'm at nine hit points. No, I can't. Yeah. We'll be okay for eight hours of sleep, and then we can go to Whitestone, ask around, come back if we need to. Let's go to sleep. We have any trees here? Pumpkin latte... I mean, not right away. They've been slaves. Why don't we give them a day off? Why don't we just give them some schooling? (gasps) Whispers... The promo link is lootcrate.com/criticalrole, promo code criticalrole for ten percent off your first month and remember, you're doing this to support the show, and to support my kid's pre-school class. And the memory of Dennis. Tell who about Xanthas? Oh. Well, there was a guy named Xanthas, we killed him, he was a dick, what's there to tell? Keyleth. Sure. We'll rally all the troops outside and maybe go in through the tunnels? I guess when we rally the troops we can form a more specific plan. Ooh, did the airship ever show up? Oh that's good! Oh wait. Well, you know. Sure, yeah. To do what? It's not all the Vestiges in the world? Oh really? She said that? We are extra awesome. Quick, let's try to fit all of our Vestiges together right now. I just stab at Pike. Maybe you should put your armor back on, Pike. Okay. The Clasp? Oh you mean our specifically? Last time I scryed there, there was someone in the keep. No. Yeah, that just gets us inside the wall. That doesn't-- that's it. The sewers is where we need to be. I think it's best to leave him here, especially since that was his plan all along, because he is a dominator of all worlds and a god among men. I think we should decide this the way we always do. Talk about it for a long, long time. (laughter) Let's put it to a vote. A voice vote. All in favor of Gilmore, say, "Hell yeah." All in favor of Allura, say, "Ah, "sure, sure." Right? Oh, just us. Allura? SAM, TALIESIN, LIAM, "Allura! I vote for Gilmore." (laughter) Hey, let's leave it to the dice! We already voted, people! And Gilmore won! Trial by combat. (laughter) Quick stop to get his parents' permission, then we're on our way. Wait, what? What happened? At dawn, we vote! Gathering? As in, like, the Insane Clown Posse is coming? Next week on Critical Role.
