D&D Beyond, what a year of sponsorship from D&D Beyond! They've been with us all campaign long, all year long, and to thank them for such a wonderful 2018, I thought I would give them a gift, an ad that will hopefully live on forever. I'm calling it My Christmas Gif. You heard that right. It's not a Christmas gift, it's a Christmas GIF. GIF. These are two Cs. Or "Jiff" if you want to say it wrong. Here's how it's going to work I don't know how to make a GIF or a "Jiff," but you fine Critters out there do. So what I'm going to do is do some movements, some reactions, some acting, and hopefully be joined by some fellow cast members. The crew's going to bring out a green screen and we're going to do this over there at this camera. You guys will be encouraged to add your own backgrounds to make this something memorable that can live online so that when you're going through the Twitters or the Reddits or the "Im-i-gurrs", I don't know what that is, "Im-gurr"? TRAVIS and Thank you. I'm an old man! When you're going through the Giphys, maybe you'll come across one of these bad boys that we're going to create live, right now, and then send some love to D&D Beyond. I'll act one out. I'm going to go over here to this camera, Matt, if you'll excuse me for one second-- Okay, we're making some GIFs, right here. Okay. We're making GIFs. You guys will turn this into a GIF later that will live on forever. There's lots of GIFs to choose from. I'm going to do one. You know the guy who blinks who is like, "Hmm, that's weird?" I'm going to do that. Okay, ready? And action. (humming) Okay! Someone will make that into a GIF! Taliesin, do you want to make one? I'll direct you. Here, I'll hold this so you can just act. There's a lot of applause GIFs out there, so why don't you do an applause or a praising type GIF? Ready? And action! Okay, that was so good. Laura, come on. This is going great, guys! There's a lot of fail GIFs, right? There's fail GIFs everywhere, right? So why don't we do one where you're rolling a dice and oh, it sucked, or something like that, I don't know. Let's see that. (groaning) Damn it, didn't work. Matt, do you want to come do one? No, these are all innocent GIFs. You know how sometimes on Twitter you see a GIF where it's like this. Like, "What that commenter said, "I agree." Just do that, just point up and be like "Yeah!" Yeah! Right? Yeah! That's a GIF right there! We just made a GIF! Last but not least, I'll do one, I'll do a success one where a d20 comes rolling in and knocks me out of the frame or something, I don't know, we'll figure it out later! Oh, yeah, that's a good one. TRAVIS and That's it! That's a wrap! Thanks, guys! (applause) That worked so well. Yes. How many days will it be sailing? You got it right! (singing) Bishaft, ah! Biscotti? I have a small list. Okay, you said that we have some cannons aboard. Do we have gunpowder? Okay. I would like to fashion, if I can, three more explosive arrowheads for myself, if possible? Or attempt to. Three times? Right in the belly of the ship. I have tinker's tools. Where do I see-- Where's that? Nope. But I am good with chemistry. Which is part of the deal. Three times? All right. Two, 11, 13! Plus four. So 17, 15, low. Hey! That's great. Oh no. No, I'm down near the cannons. That's where the gunpowder is. Three! Plus zero. Two! It is at an angle. Plus seven, but wait! Don't I have something on dexterity saves where I can-- I don't know. Don't I have something? I should know my shit! What's evasion? It's an area effect! So if it's a big explosion, maybe? No. Okay. Oh shit! First of all, am I singed? Did the other arrows-- Is everything safe? Is anything else going to blow up? Any other fire? Six! No, everything's fine! I'll climb up. It's okay! There was a booby trap set by Avantika! But I found it and disarmed it! It's all right. We're safe now. I know. I was just making sure that we were safe and we definitely are now! Thank you! No, I'll be okay below. But Beauregard? In Halfling, I will say to her There's someone hiding downstairs. We need to act fast, but don't alert the others yet; they'll overreact! You and I are the calm and steady ones. We can deal with this. Sorry. I just don't want us to all go down there and scare away whatever it is-- oh, no I'm still in Halfling! What do you think? Who, Fjord?! He hasn't done anything to us! I don't know how to translate it! Gather close, everyone. In Common there might be someone down below, hiding. In my exploration, I might have seen a shape moving down there. I don't want us to go charging down there and blow up--! Shh! Not too loud! I don't think so. This one was very specific in its design, seemed to be a one-of-a-kind thing, I hope. Isolate! Contain! Kill! Didn't she die? You said Jester, too. (talking through his teeth) Near the galley is where I saw the thing move. Ooh, so much better then mine. Is there a way to flank around behind wherever that shape was? Hood up. 23. Why did he send us three? Do you want me to go scare it out or something? I don't know how to do that. Ooh! Your duplicate! Do that, too! Just send the Thaumaturgy, then. Okay. SAM and Jester! Fjord, said to contain! (shouting) Get down! I'm going to point my crossbow at her. Get down! Don't say a word! No! This is not good cop, bad cop. We're supposed to contain! Contain! I mean, she's so cute! How could I do that to you? I'm so sorry! Whoa! What were you doing hanging out on a ship in a pirate island? You're a little cutie pie! I mean, that seems like a perfectly reasonable explanation for me. I pull out my dead rabbit's foot that I have. I have this, too! It's something. What sort of thing? Do you have it? Amazing roll. It's just that we're surrounded by gunpowder down here, so maybe not right now. Didn't need that one. It's real! Don't show her that. We do. I can't argue with that, either. No, we should really have Caleb look at this. He's much smarter than any of us down here. No! Beau, get it! Get the thing! Get the ball! One luck. These are all the right answers. A stench of urine? That's my bad. I'm down here a lot. I thought it was me. Let's go introduce you to the others. Okay, so they're all big. They're all bigs. Sure, yes. Yes, we can choreograph something. We've done that before. No, they're all big, so don't be intimidated. One of them is a big cow man, but he's cool. There's a stony-faced, harbinger of death-type lady. She's pretty cool, though. She's cool. She likes flowers. I do the same. I also put flowers in my hair sometimes. Well, I mean, I don't want to-- No, no! I think she meant all of us. I think she meant all of us. It's okay. You can be-- That's chocolate. Caleb is very smart, and he's good with magic. He can probably determine what you're carrying, what that ball was that Beau has now. It seemed legit. From bad people. Unspecified, so far. Oh, you did something to deserve this? That's not-- No parents? You're an orphan? So you're an orphan for a while? Bullshit? What are you talking about? She's the greatest person in the world. Oh, she is whispering something. dndbeyond.com/criticalrole, let them know that you came from us. Give them some love. She's got a rodent in her pocket. It's a squirrel. Sometimes a cat, so be careful with your squirrel around his cat. Oh, shit! Happy fun ball? Was he the docent or something? Why did you think he was mean? What gave off that impression? You know him? Oh. The Exalted Collection. You can copy off of me. She made 15 gold pieces down there out of nothing. She has a bit of magic. He's assessing his new crew. This is what a professional captain does. Just to allay some of our fears, were people actively pursuing you and chasing you when you got onto this boat? And if so, how many? May they rest in peace. Do you think they might still be chasing or tracking you or wanting to find you? Ooh. That's not great. (whispering) She's holding! Caleb would know. I'm going to, seeing as how she said there are folks chasing her, as we get going again, go up to the crow's nest, and do a scan with my awesome perception, and see if there's any boats trailing us. 11. I run over to them and say Oh, Twiggy just did this thing with her tongue where she made it into a circle. It was really great; you've got to see it later! It's really cool. Change the name! The Squallbeater. The Balleater! I never remember to use it like that. Wow, that was very impressive! You've made some allies today with that. We could paint a new flag with your brush. Okay. Are you ever going to use that paint? You had mentioned briefly that some of Avantika's men and helpers had been armed with firearms. If I scout around, is there any ammo aboard this ship? 29! Wait. 28. Any that fit the gun that I have? I stole a gun a while ago. Oh, you might have been-- That fit my piece? Like that? Cool. Thanks. That's third base. (laughter) We can't see the next deck? Oh god. What? I'm not doing that, no way! You're crazy! Yes! Thank you. Why do we care what's in the-- oh, man. It's open! Go! Or it could be the tail of a whale or something. Or if it's their pink haversack! What is it? Sure. Why are you looking at me when you say that? No, I'm not going in! Into somebody's laundry bag? All right. I'll take a big swig and get ready. Of course. I squeeze it way too hard. Yes. (yelling) It was crazy down there. The lights, the monsters! It was insane! It was a parade of horrors. Yeah, there was nothing down there. No, it was nothing. But it's a lot of space, so if we wanted to store something for safekeeping, it's a good spot to do it. Come on, Deborah. Adorable? He made you socially awkward? You were trapped somewhere? This was in Port Damali? Wow. Is the ground dirt, gravel, or stone? Just to give us a visual. Guys, D&D Beyond. Check your Twitters and Giphys for the gifs that have already started pouring in. This seems legit. 25. But we have healed. Don't do that again! Oh! Halas' cape? He's hurt! Yeah, Twiggy just hurt him. It's your ship. Scoot me over somewhere, too, while you're up there, Marisha. Just near Fjord. Boom. Just like us. Halas? Did anyone escape? It was a lot helpful! So we know blue, bad, black, bad-- Well, maybe one of them is a good! Maybe one of them's a way out of here! But someone needs to step out of it in order to trigger the other-- Sure. Well, let's do some honeycomb, then. Smell? Sound? Vision? That's the way out! I don't have to do shit. I'm just going to sit there, drinking. Deep pockets! That door is still closed? So there's no way in or out, and every door is bad. Well, that was the wailing one. The guy said it was the wailing one. Give what a whirl? Oh, I thought you picked that lock. The red one? We have a way out! I'll help you. Great! I'm getting day drunk! Before we do anything, I'm going to whisper to Jester You know, I like Twiggy, but she picks all the locks, she does the Mage Hand thing, she does the Hideous Laughter thing, she paints. She has a cute animal. Are we being replaced? Is this some joke? Maybe they don't need us any more. Oh my god! Let's kill her. When the moment is right. No. You just go. No, it's fine, you do it. Nope, you've got it. I'm fine. Have fun. Tell me how it goes. and We're fine, Fjord. Everything's fine. Oh, now we have to go. We can't let her die. Vertigo just from the shape of the room? Can you make light? Is anyone? We need light. That's weird. Do we press ahead? But it might even be the way back out. Well, Twiggy? All right. I'll go after Twiggy. Always. Hey, we're sort of in size order! Come on, Jessie. Yes. 32. The Raven and the Rook is a thing that I don't have any information about. Look at all those books! But there's no other doors in this room? I will look for a door. That's cocked. Six. Do all of it again. He's wearing a red robe, you said? A ruby in the Astral Sea? MATT and Ah! What did he touch?! (yelling) Fjord! No! How can you focus on the cabinet right now?! Okay, you're right. There might be information in there. Let's go look at the cabinet. I will support you and help you and aid you, but judgmentally. No one else touch it! Unlock it? Yes. Yes, I will aid you. Let's open it. Let's feel around, wiggle around. Hits. Uncanny dodge. Oh, boy. Hey! Roll for Marishative. 12. Whoa, you guys. Same exact move. Yes, that's a 23. Bonus action disengage! Ow! So much blood. Hey, that's great. It's got four legs. That's a perceptive cabinet. Do I roll against that? Oh, does not hit. It's okay, she's lived in a box for like a week. The desk is a mimic. Side of a barn door, right? Is Jester's duplicate considered--? Okay. Well then, I will bonus action-- shit. I won't bonus action. I will move away from it. 16. Okay. I'll skitter behind near that candelabra and bonus action hide. Well, I was going over-- Okay. 19 plus a million. So it's a-- 29, yeah. I think we still have Pass without Trace. 39. Then I will attack from my hidden position. Okay, so that is a 24 to hit. Still 24 to hit. Let's see here. (counting) That's 21, plus I'll use Fury of the Small. That's 28. I was going to use one of my explosive arrows, but I have three, and one of them doesn't work. So I don't know which one I drew. It's a two! Where do I shoot on a cabinet? I'll wait till the doors are just a little open and try to thread the needle and jam it right through its mouth heart. It's filled with pepper. Are you okay? I'm not. I'm a goblin. Did anyone check this desk over here, next to the portrait? What about the far desk, behind the mimic? I'll go snoop around there. 18 for me. So I can't pick it? I'll try. Natural ten. 20. Okay. Do you have Knock or something? Yawn. Yes, of course! We've got to find out what's going on. Yes, of course. The ruby one? I will search for traps. 11. 13. Doesn't look like it's dangerous. Looks safe. The burned one? Take the book! At least take the book! Hey, I've got an idea. I don't know how much time we have, and yes, we've got to find Fjord-- Caleb, do we have her Happy Fun Ball? It's gone? Do you have your haversack? No! Our options right now are to pull the mysterious ruby book, to touch the glass, or to keep searching. You want them both? I'll get the ink. Oh, it's got an arcane lock. Can you undo an arcane lock? Can you dispel it or something? A conundrum. Right now Fjord's having coffee with Grog. Okay. I'll try to pick it again, I guess. Oh, it's not locked! Oh. We open it! No! Twiggy! Don't! Yeah, we're looking in the desk. Don't do this! I made this mistake before. It could be alive. Not me. I'm staying with Caleb until the bitter end. This is everything we ever wanted a room full of books and it's just us. Should we just stay here for a while? I could pick them all. I just need time. A mechanism! I can try. I'll try to unlock the mechanism. What am I rolling? 23. Do they look good? All right. I'll try to unlock the next one. That's not as good. 12. I'll go to the third one. Ooh, that's better! 28. But all these books-- you're sure you got all the spell books? We need the spell books. I'm going to just see if there's any loose books on lower shelves that I can grab on my way out. Any other books? I take two on the other shelf and let's go. Damn it! I'll try one. Nope. Didn't work. 15. All right, I'm going. I can't reach. We could have done the ruby book! Or it could've been the spell book that answered all your problems. Don't worry. You got backup in about five minutes. (laughter) He's going to talk to you. Oh my god. D&D Beyond. (exaggerated Southern accent) Hexblade's Curse. Punch the gem at him. Fire elemental. All the toys. Why would you do this to Deborah Ann Woll? Maybe we can give it the rotten drug fruit that we have. You did it! We got some books. (laughter) He will! Mini Halas. (as Halas) Have you put on weight? Disguise Self as Halas. And he's got Bane or something. Oh god, yes. How would you know? It was not. We could stay here, Caleb. Bye! Yasha's just like looking around the boat. Oh god. Hey! I think I can unlock this one! Twiggy's invisible. Beau's gone. Caduceus is stone. This is going great. Do a higher level? It's all you could do. Going down fighting. Are you invisible with Blink? Oh, thank Jesus. Whoa. Hey! We're going to land right on him! 12. Acrobatics check or save? Oh, it's a 12. No, I was right. Did we cause some damage to the dragon? Great. Mmm, eight. Caleb! What's going on? Oh my god. Did Caleb and Nott see that? Do we make a check of any kind? No, she's not okay. She's been abandoned by everyone who can help her. Thank you, Halas. One. Hits. That's my armor class. I'll use Uncanny Dodge for, I guess, that one. Lying on the ground, I will fire up at the dragon with my crossbow, trying to quickly load one of my explosive charges. He's within five feet of a friend, yes? So it's a sneak attack? Sure. Yeah, I'm going for its head. Oh boy, that's not great. 18. Okay. Shit. Well, can I stand up first? 18, plus whatever the explosion does. 3d6? 11. 23. Okay. He's still alive. I use half my movement to get up. I use my bonus action to fire again. Natural fucking one! Oh. What does that do? I don't know how this works. If you roll a one-- I've never done this before-- on a d20 attack you must succeed in a dexterity saving throw-- which I don't, or suffer 1d6 piercing damage to myself. It's two. Damn it. Okay. No, because it'll hit me. I mean, I guess it'll hit me anyway, right? Okay, I'll walk around away from the fire guy. Okay. No. Well, she left already. I'm half. Caleb, wait for--! Oh, okay. Bye. You can go farther down the hall or something? Very valuable. Is he blind? Sure, hits. Okay. I've gone since my last one, so I'll dodge. Twiggy, fucking kill this dragon or get us out of here! Do something! Is the dragon looking at all rough or not really? Why does Halas like us? And it's way shorter. It's Nott's turn, not Jester's turn. I will run towards the exit. No. No. Mm-hmm. I'm okay. I'll turn around and fire my crossbow at the thing. It's not great. It's only a 16. If I use my bonus action to fire again, I can't touch the thing, right? I'll go. Yeah, I got one hit point. Yeah. Get out of there! I mean, I'm not crazy! Jesus. What? Did you really? I'm going to go over to Jester and take the flower out of her head and be like I think it worked. I'm going to take it back now. Oh, shit. I don't want-- Oh. It was nice to meet you and nearly die next to you. Bye! Am I okay? Yes, I'm fine. Are you okay? Would I what? Onto you? I will jump up onto Caleb and I will give him a big kiss on his nose, and I will whip out the last book I had. We still have books to go through! Wow! Killing a dragon with a natural 20!
