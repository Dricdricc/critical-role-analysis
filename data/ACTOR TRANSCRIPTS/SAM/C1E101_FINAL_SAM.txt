But I thought that was only a limited-release item, Laura. Let's talk about the Scanlan t-shirt a little more. I can do some art. Taliesin, I feel like most of the time you don't know what you're going to be talking about. So maybe you should just have a go-to. Like, it's going to be Daredevil again. Or something. Just something. Yeah, we just lost half the audience. Should've died. I don't know how much time has passed since the fight, but can Taryon cast Revivify on Doty still? I came back to get him! But I have to get his body somewhere. Great. But then we can't come through. Also, does each portal go to the same place, or do they go to different parts? Game over! And one, do we know where it is? No, we found the objects on that cart. Who's the eighth? I live in Ank'harel and I'm a crime boss. I hadn't been invited. Oh, okay, see, you don't really need me after all. All right. Are you all offering? The help. Okay, that's good enough for me. I'm in. Will fancy boy be joining us? No. He's part of the team. Shit! This again! I'm sorry, I was busy caring for my deceased robot. No, he's fine. He'll be fine. I just have to rebuild him. It'll take some time and money, which I don't have. All right. I need him for the brigade! Yes. But I can't carry him. Grog, would you be able to... Not yet, Chod. Wait until we get somewhere where I can work on it. Let me look. Okay. I don't understand any of that. But there you have it. Sure. I do that. Chod can't use that, can he? Chod, can you use this? I mean, do we need it? Do we need it? Do we need it? Yes. Just say yes. When a girl offers you something, you just say yes. Wait. You're an engineer, aren't you? Ah. I will assist you. With, like, Ashley's face right here. (laughter) Gif it! Gif it! (laughter) Waterbed. I'm sure it's nothing. Probably nothing. Just leave it. I have to, yes. I have to repair Doty, and also find some new recruits. I think there are some in Whitestone, right? Of course. It's my destiny. I met you all to become an adventurer, and now I'm bringing my knowledge back to my people. It's like it was written in a book. I am. I hadn't thought of that. You know what? There's no leader of Vox Machina, so maybe there won't be in the Darrington Brigade. Well, besides you. You're unofficially-- you're definitely the treasurer. I suppose we'll need him for now, yes. You're suggesting that I, Scanlan Shorthalt, bequeath my employee Chod to this gentleman here? You mean me, Taryon Darrington? You mean Chod could join my brigade? Well, yes. I guess that's what they're talking about. Well, I don't see why not. He's very capable and strong. Yes, and I won't have much use for him for a while, so if you'd like to take him with your brigade, you can. Well, I'm not going to say no to a fellow member of Vox Machina now, am I? No, you're not. No, I'm not. Not quite yet. Change arms. Stays there. Thank you. I don't know. How to Play Pathfinder. (laughter) It's not a salad with meat on it, it's a salad made of meat? I'm just giving him CPR. (laughter) I'm in my room, praying. Mm-hm. Or Logic. (laughter) (whispering) We're only seven people. Who's the eighth? Count the table, friend. Did you say gay-bone? Scorsese. Is this fancy enough for a Heroes' Feast? From the church. But you have to sign this poster. (laughter) I guess Taryon will go find Vex. Stumble up and say, I have to stay here and keep working on Doty. I understand you're leaving today. I cannot. I have to stay and fix Doty and get back to my home. I'm sorry. It's been a pleasure. It's been an honor to have your acquaintance, and I'm afraid I have to return, but perhaps we'll meet again sometime. Do you have any money? (laughter) I need money. How about this? I wrote you a check. Can you rip it up? I don't think I can pay it, ever. (laughter) Thank you. And you have no other money on you? Well, I feel like I should leave you with all of my belongings, and all of my magical items, but I need them for my brigade. I'll leave you with the seashell crown that who gave me? Grog? Percy gave me. Do you want the half of a geode rock with 30 living souls inside of it? I can't use it. Maybe I should have shown that to Pike sometime in the last year? Do you think you'll see Percy anytime soon? When you do, (pink) can you give him this little gem for his flashlight? I can't spare many, but that will give him one flashlight. Well, after he's fixed, me and Chod-- I prefer Chod. I think we'll set off the old-fashioned way. Ooh! That could be chapter one of the new book. Yes. A New Hope. Something like that. Yes. Well, I'm not going to say have fun, because you're going to a terrible place. If you die, I will be very upset. Hey, if I die, your thing will glow, so that will be good. I'll see you sometime in Wildemount? All right. You, too. Take care of your hair. You know, you shouldn't wash it as often as you do. It just makes it dry and flaky. Get it trimmed every two weeks. And have someone comb it. It's really disgusting sometimes. Thank you. All right. Goodbye. I'll see you soon, Little Elf Girl. Sure. Oh, the armor? Let's go. Let's move! Who the fuck cares? We're going to a cursed place. You think one plate armor's going to do anything? (screams) Nine. No, 17. We're doomed to repeat it. Somewhere, Taryon is reading a history book. 11. That's a bad sign. 26. Should I make us all ghoulie? This is terrible. I haven't had this much fun in a long time. Let's go do it. I'll cast Seeming on us and make us all gray, pointy-eared, little Nosferatu-vampirey things, I suppose. Did I see the thing that skittered out? I've seen other undead things. Yeah. My guy will look more like the Meat Man in undead form, but otherwise, everyone's normal. Your ear's half off. Sure. Okay. Maybe we should stagger. We'll walk like this. Let's get married. Ooh, Foresight! Shit. It's real good. (laughter) You can see just in the future. Three seconds. Am I going to die in three seconds? Am I going to die in three seconds? (laughter) I feel like Vax should lead the party. 17. Oh! You know what, seems important, I will inspire myself. Can I do that? I haven't done this in so long. 18. Maybe this city was taken somewhere else or something. Transported here. Is there any architecture that I, or anyone, notices, like from a region of where we've been? Mid-century modern, mostly? Man, we should have brought Tary. Do we recognize them? I could be bait. Then you could come ambush them. Wait, we're staying put and they're walking off somewhere else? How are we going to see what's going to happen? We can ambush them. Should I put someone out there to confuse them? There's three of them, right? Hey, look, we're killing things! Well, maybe. 85? It was Kima and Allura on a mission. They're dead. Which mouth? You're going to use a carrot? All right. Can I have a try? You've got one eye, right? Ugh. Gross ocular muscles. I just want to make you feel good, man, so I'll just sing to you. I'll hold up my cone, and I'll sing, (singing) Just the two of us. You can't quit me if you tried. Just the two of us. Me and your eye. So I'll Dominate Person. Will you please tell us everything you know when we ask you? Where are you from? Did you come through a ziggurat in Wildemount? And if so, where? He? The flying things. Well, we know what they are now. Do the flying things have magical powers? The smoke-making thing that you were carrying. What is it and how does it work? The last war on Thar Amphala! What does that mean? What does that mean? Oh, that's where we are. She really is, that's being rude. But who lives in the tower? Is it Vecna or Mistress Delilah? The Mistress Delilah. Where is she right now? Entropis is the tower? The only tower. What protections do you have on the tower? You don't go in? And what are your people called? Your group, your cult? What's your job with the Remnants? What will the ritual do? He's just a farmer, guys. I don't think he knows all of the intricacies. What has Delilah promised you? What do you gain out of this? Did you bring something through the portal? What was it? When does the ritual begin? I know we look different now, but if you had to pick one of us, which is the most handsome? I thought so. Can you escort us to the tower? Dominate Person has got to be wearing off. One minute. It's probably over. Well, if we just release him into the city without his censer... No, no. If we send him away from us, maybe one of those things will find him and we'll have a clearer path. Yeah, if we send him away from us and then we go the other way. He's a human distraction!
