It's Stan Lee. That's Gilbert Gottfried? Spoiler! Taking five. So we found out that there's a ritual happening soon. And there's no day or night here, so who cares, right? We have to make our way to the big tower, right? Super fast, and invisibly. Oh, we're also vampire creatures! We look like miscellaneous vampirey things, right? What? The censer. It protects you from ghouley deads. So why don't we just walk through the center of town, in the middle of the road, with the censer, and walk into the tower? No? Maybe? Fly up to the top of the tower? Teleport somewhere? She does. Or we can be smoky mist. But we're making our way to the tower. Let's be all full, though. We can be full. Yeah, let's be full. Oh, God. Someone in a robe. 33. What's our ploy if this thing tries to kill us? Okay. Wow. This thing works. What's going on? Good one. You can do that? You put the ass in astute. Oh, God! In our direction? But quick! But also moving like zombies. Can we see outside at all? Is there a peephole or anything? I'm going to go over there. Oh. Don't do anything? I was going to try to make a little diversion to draw them away from the door. I'll do that. I'll do my thing. I'm going to look through the little sliver and I'm going to cast-- I'm going to cast Major Image and make a small little human girl in the middle of the street, crying, bleeding from the arm. She looks disoriented and she's walking towards the other building that we spotted, very sad and (whimpering). Okay, she's going to run. She's going to book it into that other building to try to get away as fast as she can. And she can move super fast since she's not real. She's like the fucking Flash. 120 feet is all I can move her. Let's get out of here. Well, she died. She got her equity card. Can we leave anything behind, like a dead body or something for them to eat? He's got a ton of them in there. Me too. We needed above a 40. Oh, look it up. It's a real thing. Wow. Too classy for us. Let's keep going. Yeah. Just go through the hole. I mean, we've got a guy who crushes rocks all the time. Yeah, it's just a hole in the wall. You sound different. Why are you using weird words? Let's go. We didn't heal ourselves. Let's get through the wall, and then we'll heal. We're slow. Hurrying. Am I rolling, too, since I'm half-out? But, I mean, am I watching this? I'm going to roll. Okay. Two for me. I'll yell to the rest it's got Keyleth. I'll cast Dominate Monster on it, I guess. Well, I was probably not fast enough to pull up my horn, so 20. I could have just done that this whole time?! All right. Please deposit her on the other side. Over the wall. I don't speak Gloom! Only 59 more minutes. Does he keep rerolling for breaking, or is that it? All right. First things first, please go tell your fellow gloomy friends that the hunt is off. No more flesh down here. And come back! It's good to be back. Okay, we'll need a name for him, obviously. So, anybody got any ideas? Benjamin is great. That's way better. (laughing) Well, some of us can, right? By looking at him, how much can he carry? Or she! Okay. Well, so no more healing. But we could fly right up there and break that thing. Like an hour or something. Some of us could get on Mr. Mistoffelees and fly around the tower and see if there's a window that we could bust in or something. Yeah, but we'll be on a thing, so maybe we won't be very conspicuous. It's just a pulsing orb of doom, isn't it? One of us needs to see what's up there. He's dumb! What if comes back and he's like 'I don't know!'? Can't one of us go up there with him to scout it out? Yeah, if someone's invisible. Can't you all be invisible? Just me. Not while I'm concentrating on Mr. Mistoffelees! (laughter) We need to get into the tower! We don't even know how to do that! Nope! I'll tell Mr. Mistoffelees to do a 90-second loop and come back down and check in on us because he can't fit in the door, right? Fly around 90 seconds and swoop back down. Maybe he doesn't know. 15 minutes! No, that was once for 15 minutes! They're about to invade. I mean, sure! What? Wait, what? No! That's terrible! Nothing! We've got to hurry! Did they tell you to gather weapons? No, he's joining the fight. No! Want to jump on and do a scouting pass? We can't risk it. Wouldn't you hate to miss it by 15 minutes? This guy was about to leave his house to go walk over there for the final part of the ritual. Me and Vax. But do it with a flair! (laughter) I mean, yeah, we're going to go as fast as we can. Let's go. Mr. Mistoffelees! Yes, we do! We'll need to spoon for warmth. I gladly accept. 21. He's fine. Natural one! I'm under his body. (quietly) How does he do that? How did you do that? What do we do? Is that the end of the ritual? Enough to get back to our friends, probably. Should we attack now? Just the two of us? We could. Between you and me, we're the most powerful ones in the group. I know, but will you at least confirm that yes, we are the most powerful? All right. Hold me tight. Mr. Mistoffeles, back down. Everybody? I want you to explain every roll. Fly away! Really? It's going to forget halfway there. Fly away! Just fly away! It seems they've completed at least some part of the ritual. Should we go straight up the tower? Yeah, all right. But we're going to fight an aerial battle against super-magical things. Maybe. Yeah, so it's not even going to be a tough fight. We'll just take down three people and be done, right? It'll be... less than three? Is that true? That's a good idea, if you can really do it. No, we either have to fly up to the top or bring it down to us, right? It feels like it's a 3.2 earthquake, we need a 6.2 earthquake. When last time we fought Delilah, were any of us scared of her? Well, if someone's going to stay out of the Feast, it should be the guy who already has advantage on everything. I'm against the Feast. I think we should just run in. Also, I'm vegan, I don't know if I could eat everything at the feast. GoFiBePo? Why didn't you just name it a Poobah Platter? Is that a raise or not? Wait, so, are we four? I can. Yes. Something like it. (gasping) That's not going to work! You said 50 points of damage? I mean, just from a metagaming scenario, that's not even-- that can't even hurt-- So you get ten 50s. So that's 1000 points. Over a minute. That's better than I thought. Although we don't-- Keyleth, you said that there's no other undead around here, right? Maybe we shouldn't look like undead, then. I don't think I can shift it. No, you can't. That's a one-time thing. We've got the one from the guy whose head we just crushed. Me and Pike, she could be on my shoulders and we could share one cloak. Oh, it absolutely should. (laughter) To make it look like our arms can reach the ends of the cloak-- are they sleeved cloaks? I'm going to hold a flute and my sword. (laughing) All right, we go! I'm so excited to be here! 24. So awkward. We've still got to attack. It's okay, we can still kill everybody. Let's go. Let's move. Let's attack. Are we within 500 feet? To the end. Is it falling towards us? I mean, it wasn't bad. Let's go. Oh, I mean, it's landing, right? Do we have an escape plan? Sure does. We have to fly to get up to it? I need a ride as well. Do you want me to be a beholder? Or a dragon? Wait and see? Figured I should do it now. It's instantaneous. But he could Counterspell it unless I do it now. No, I think I'm going to just go ahead and be a beholder and fly in there myself. We'll probably all die. Matthew Mercer, may I borrow your Monster Manual so I know what I am? Yeah! It doesn't say what his initiative is. Okay. All right. 11. 11. Shit, I'm gonna lose my fucking 9th-level spell. Neither have Luck. I'm a beholder. Are you sure about that? This is True Polymorph. I am this creature. Except it's not, because I'm about to not be anymore. 18. Even with advantage? Oh, fuck. Is Pike out? He's a god! He's a golden god! My anti-magic cone is not in effect, I assume? (laughs) Just frozen there. I really want to swallow and I can't close-- Well, you have to choose. At the start of each turn-- I haven't had a turn. We got this, guys. How many of us are still able to move? Hey! Okay! Pike's going to solve everything. Yeah, she can get us out of this. Oh no, lair action, she explodes. (laughter) No, forget them! Fix us! Forget them, they're nothing. Fix us. Fix. Us. They're tiny. Fix us. Some sort of-- I don't know, can you restore... Restoration? 18. I will never be able to break it. Yeah, there's no way. That's rough stuff. I don't think-- I don't know. What's a legendary resistance? This doesn't. I added wrong. Wait, wait! Stop everything. I added wrong. My saving throw was a 23. Oh! So what did I just get hit with? 70 points or something? Awesome. Do that a lot. Plus anything? Oh boy. Nope. I can't move my eyes or anything or turn on my anti-magic? Oh, my spell. I get advantage as a gnome. 70 points. Okay. As a wisdom? Constitution saving throw. Oh! I'm no longer paralyzed. No! But I'm a different guy! Hey, guys. Okay, do I get advantage because of magic? And can I inspire myself? All right. I will inspire myself. 24. Just move. I can't act, right? I can move now, or just in general? What does that mean? What does confused mean? That's actually good. He'll lose the paralysis because he'll be in a coma. We'll just wake you back up and you'll be fine. It's actually kind of good. I'll kill you last. What is that thing in the middle of the field? Oh. Well, that's different. He meant metaphorical. He meant death. Perma-death? Maybe we should leave. Is this Delilah? I thought she was confused. Wait, what? What's happening? With Foresight? Oh, because you're paralyzed. Oh fuck. I'm too far to do anything, right? It has to be within 60 feet. Can I retroactively Counterspell? (laughs) I think I have to roll for this. No. Charisma modifier? It's just an 11. I can't add anything else. LAURA, TALIESIN, and Not on a reaction, I don't think. Doesn't feel good. What's that mean? (nervous laughter) It's cocked. It would have been 11. Four. Matt is a gentle god. Oh. Hey, you know what the problem is with your face? I can see it! (laughter) Ghostly claws. You've been banished to another dimension. You can punch your way out of it. Again? This is the same round, right? Can I try-- Great. Laura. She can't reach you? I can bring you to her. I don't know. You have to touch her? If we don't die in those two turns, yes. I'm going to be a total dick and not do that. No, we're next to each other. Well, they can go whenever they want. Oh, it's my turn. Where's Percy? Wait, it's still working? There's a creature inside of her. You're fine. You're good. It's the last thing. That was a long turn. You did good. Okay. I grab Pikey-poo and Dimension Door straight to Vex's beautiful dead body. I will inspire Pike. I don't know if that helps whatever ritual you're about to do, but maybe. TRAVIS and With inspiration. I'm using any movement I have to pick up the dust of my fallen friend, if there is any dust. Pick up whatever I can. (fake sneeze) Oh no! I'm done. That's all I can do. I don't know if you can do a bonus action. She's fine. I'm already rolling Vax. Yeah. Tuck it behind my ear for later. Yeah, but it's going to take another turn. No, Taryon's on the floor, weeping, holding his necklace. Liam can be Taryon now! (laughs) No! It's an established character we already have artwork for. Why let it go to waste? He's done prissy boys before. I will 6th-level Counterspell. (cheering) I will sing at him, (singing) Counterspell, baby don't hurt me. Don't hurt me no more. Counterspell! I can add things to it, right? You're still inspired. d12 on top of that. At everything. It wasn't my best performance. Maybe one of them is our friend Mr. Mistoffelees. He doesn't know. And you have to not be wind. Oh yeah. That sounds bad. I used it already. Oh yeah, that hits. I think I'm not attuned-- yeah. Against magic? That's better. 17. Disadvantage on all attack rolls? You're alive. Okay, it's something. 28. As much as I can carry. 30. Those boots are gone! Is this a new round since my last Counterspell? That's what I say to myself every morning. Wait, did you just cure our wounds? You can do it to one person. Oh no, dexterity. He's trying to hurt our Pikey. It never got her to zero. I will Lightning Bolt at level four the armor knight guy. He's behind me, so I'll do it from my ass. (laughter) I'll lift up my leg a little bit. Squeeze it out. It's 8d6, but at level four it's 9d6, I think? 35. I'll use my movement to gather whatever bits of Vax I can still see. And get into "posish." I will bonus action Healing Word Pikey-poo, which is for me-- what is Healing Word? It's 2d4 plus six? Ten. I do, but I want to save it. Do people have to be alive to get out of here? Yep. 7th-level Counterspell against him. (laughter) Let's go. Sure. I will say to him, this time-- I've got nothing left. I will sing to him, (singing) I'm beautiful. I'm beautiful, it's true. You saw my face in a crowded place, and you didn't know what to do because I just took a shit on you. Oh god. Have I been there? Wait, was that me? Yes. Okay. Can you? Without a body? Without a body? Which you've already done. They're hard to use. We've got to learn to use them better. Wow. I'm shaking.
