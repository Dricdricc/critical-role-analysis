I think you mean upgraded. I can't open this. There's Lego stuff! My kid's gonna love this! Lego Dimensions fun pack of-- That's Liam Neeson? Voltron? That's not Voltron? I'm so stupid. No. I'm pretty sure that's Voltron, guys. Ooh, 'How to build a tabletop RPG character'! That's very helpful. I will read that. Okay. I just wanted to say the things that we're supposed to say, which is, our sponsor Lootcrate, this was their last month's theme, 'build'. This month's theme is 'primal', featuring brands like X-Men, Overwatch, and Predator. If you go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and use the promo code 'criticalrole', one word, you get 10% off. I've prepared a very, very small bit tonight, because I knew we had the unboxing to do. I thought for our international audience, they might like to know how to say Lootcrate in different languages. So I did some really good research. Not five minutes on Google Translate, I'll tell you that much. In Spanish, Lootcrate is 'las ganancias cajas'. In German, it's 'der Zaster Casten'! In Japanese, it's 'senri-hin kureto'. In Latin, it's 'praedam corbis'. In Dutch, it's 'buit krat'. In Swedish, we're talking 'plundra spjällĺda'. And in Klingon, (yells in Klingon). (all cheer) Oh, and in pig latin, it's 'Am-say's ick-day is ig-bay'. All right, good. Taliesin's on an iPhone 2 over there. One of them was Taliesin's announcement that he has some show on Wednesday nights. Don't worry, we'll get like three more. Taliesin just made a robot. 17 more announcements, guys. Yes. To become underwater sea-breathers? I mean, technically, I could. It would use a lot of my spell abilities, but I could give four of my little coins to people, and those coins could be used to alter yourself to be a water-breathing madman like me. Well, sort of. Just you, but with gills. Sure, yeah, you could do that. I could also think of a spell that would give you a clever Rastafarian crab sidekick. Well, yes, if we want to recover all our abilities for tomorrow. At dawn, we swim. No. (laughs) Crafting goggles. Would it be helpful to craft something that would allow us to speak? Or-- I am, I would say the best at crafting, actually. I've spent my whole life doing it. I have no idea. But the adventure is to try, right? And I certainly will give it a go. A bubble around what? Ooh. The firearm. The firearm has to be enclosed, not you. But it would only last one shot. Blow a hole in the side, then water would get out. That might be something we could try to make, I suppose. We could take apart Trinket. That's your bear, right? That's your robot bear. We could take apart that. Oh, well then, never mind. We don't touch Doty. We lure the kraken onto land. Yes, Antlers? I mean, if you inspected them, you would know that they say 'T.D.' on them. They're sort of personal to me. I've had them minted. I don't think that would work. It's sort of a thing that I can do and I'm pretty cool at it. None taken. I respect the question and I respect you wanting to work with someone of my skill set and aptitude. I saw your work back there at the last fight and, well, the gunslinger was rendered useless and everyone else was fighting on the other boat against lesser allies. Uh, enemies, I mean. You and I held off that beast together and it was quite amazing to watch. I made the kill. It was 100% mine. But you were there and it was a good assist and I appreciate it. I have a question for you as well. My rod of mercurial form. We know that it can turn into a crossbow? How many crossbow arrows do I own? Any? 40! Okay, great. Thank you. Yes, I would love that. Thank you. How much do I owe you for it? It seems like you're just fucking with me. (all laugh) Let's call it an even five gold. Well, I don't want there to be any sort of implied favors or anything that I have to return later. If you're all right with it, I'd like to just keep this business, thank you. I mean, are we doing that? I can do four of those Alter Self coins. Yeah, we're treading water. Ooh, I like this. She is smart. Yes, yes, absolutely. I volunteer to be a rider or a captain of the ship sort of. A harness around the big man? I think that would be quite a formidable steed. All right. Just strategizing, chum. I don't know what "at will" means, but I'm very impressed. I do. What do we need it for? Oh, to put the-- The things in that we're finding. Oh, yes, yes, of course and they would be great keepsakes. Oh, well, if we find an extra one, perhaps I could take that back as a-- Yes? New guy here-- No, nope, nope. New guy here, just a process question. I'm new to these sort of strategy "seshes" that you guys have. Is this how it always is, with people just throwing out random bad ideas constantly for, like, 15 minutes? Wow, because I really-- this is a big fight for me. I've never fought anything quite so big. Is there a chance that we might perish? Because it doesn't seem like we have a good plan right now. All right. That does make me feel better. That sounds like the stupidest fucking plan I've ever heard. I've read some of those. All right. Oh. Did you do Alter Self just now? No more spells. (dolphin noises) Well, if I may. The big fellow over there said that he had some sort of vials that you could breathe air out of. Is that true? May I examine it? No, it's not. What is the thing that you have? Hm. Please don't leave me behind. I would love to, but, there's no one to ride. That makes sense. It's amazing. Like a lure? I don't like any of this. When I was treading water before, was it difficult in armor? Was it-- And if I were to remove my armor, would I be weak and squishy? Uh-huh. But it's shiny. I have a robe, I have a robe. I can just wrap myself in my robe. It has some colorful patches on it, yes. But they're not shiny. Stitch up the front of my robe? All right, I would, yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. You lot are taking good care of me. I appreciate that. Thank you. This is going to be fun! Right? Tomorrow? Yes? All right. This reminds me of one of my caretakers when I was younger, stitching up some of my play clothes. It's a nice feeling. Thank you so much. Skyfuck! (Keanu Reeves as Johnny Utah impression) He's not coming back. Trinket-form. How many of us need my coins to become altered? Oh, well then, I can just-- You won't be able to swim very fast, though. She can't use Alter Self and Pass Without a Trace. Yes. Yeah. I need one for me. So four of them. You could just have Water Breathing, and be riding a whale. But if you get tossed from the whale, can you swim? And then you can use it if you need it. You're a whale. I know every knot in the book. The double-sloop. The reverse-cowgirl. I know 'em all. I've got the itsy-bitsy spider. I know the rusty trombone. I've got-- Yep. Got the figure eight, the figure four, the hidden figures. I've got a bunch of 'em, yep. Oh, yes. That one. That one's good. (all laugh) Bigly man over there, do you want a coin in case you lose your whale form? What about you, Percival? All right. You say, 'Alter Self!' and slam it against your body and it'll make you with gills and stuff. Does he speak-- he speaks Common, right? He understands what I'm saying? Make big, big hit, say 'Alter Self'-- All right, I guess I'll make four coins. And pass them out to Percy, Little Elf Boy, Little Elf Girl, and Jumbo. Oh. Have you heard the Legend of Taryon Darrington? Good, then, we're equals. That's very confusing. Okay. Okay. Were your parents fond of you, because to name them that similar would be-- just quite annoying, growing up, you must've gotten confused constantly. Yeah. Wait, there's a door? We're going to another plane? Oh my. Okay. This is great. This is great. I am. Wait, don't you have to make some of us-- Oh, no. How deep is this? I would prefer Doty not come. He can't swim, right? I'm a little confused. We're going underwater now, but not to where we're going for the mission? All right, then Doty can come this far. Just to the door. Yes. I hadn't thought of that. The rusty Doty? (all laugh) Doty, you should stay behind. Stay behind, and just take atmospheric notes, you know. Time of day, position of sun. Type of clouds. And if anyone tries to steal my stuff, describe them very well in the book. It's all for color, for the book, you know. Two chapters of seagull flight patterns. If I examine it, do I detect any magic on it? I pull out my compass and see if it works. Sure. Yeah, I have a compass, by the way. Hm. Fascinating. Oh, sorry. Yes. One second. Just, still pressurizing. Oh yes, do you want a-- The leader? Absolutely. The navigator. Sure. Sure. Yes. You don't watch him drop his lodes. Wait a second! Okay. Nothing. But they can't see the map, yet, can they? Aberration? It's an animal. They're aliens. It's impossible, it's from inside the room! (garbled voice) Should we use our flashlights? (garbled voice) I don't know, it felt-- Thank you. I'm going to load up my flashlight with one of those Daylight gems, but with the lens fully closed, so no light can escape. Sure. Okay. I tend to have that effect on people. Sure. Stealth checks! Stealth checks! 20! With our boost. Do you need some help finding it? Compass, yeah. Is the compass moving? I'm gonna cast Detect Magic. I don't hear that, so I just cast Detect Magic. Within 30 feet. Even under three feet of sand. One foot of stone, one inch of metal. I'll come with. I'm coming too, I want to-- And I'm going to cast Detect Magic again. Oh, okay, Jesus! I'm just trying to help us find the fucking lodestones. Me too. 24. A stream of diarrhea come out of his rear end. Our masks are like-- Just goggles. So our mouth is free and-- Okay, I vomit. (all laugh) I'm looking at the compass. All right, I'll use Detect Magic again. Yeah, what does it say? This music is fucking creepy. (mimics music) 41? 45?! I'm casting Detect Magic. Okay, keep going, it's around the rock. Oh wait a second! Eh, all right. Detect Magic lasts for ten minutes! So this is all one spell, yeah? Yeah! Yes. One. Five, I-- I got a natural one. Yeah. The kraken eats me. Yes? (gasps) I got it. I've got it! I've got it! (all shush) (gags) Natural one. (all groan) Yeah! (gagging noises) It would help me and Taliesin see. (whispers) I could've used Luck. Forgot about it. 13. Liam, how do you remember when to use Luck? Yeah, well, I forgot. I didn't hear any of that. I did! And grateful for it. 26. Hit it! What is going on? Okay. 35! Sure! Oh, yeah that hits. Yeah, of course. Do not send him packages of fish. Ah! Me? Oh, Christ. I can't move my hands or anything. My body. Okay. The attacks are at disadvantage. Jesus. I'm going to reach for my robes, so carefully sewn by young Laura Bailey. And rip off-- I think I have a patch. Don't I have some spells on there? Is that from my robe or is that somewhere else? No, you gave me some scroll spells. Some spell scrolls. I wrote down that I have a hypnotic pattern somehow. Was that a patch or was that something else? It must have been a-- It must have been a patch or something. Oh yeah! Yeah yeah yeah, patch! It's a patch. It's a patch. I'm ripping off a patch. Yes. Correct. Yes. Wait, what? Oh. Oh I do-- it worked! Okay. On the item. Jesus. So many things. I know! I know, right? It just says 'Spell scroll'. The item-- I mean, I think it's mine. Oh. Does that have its own DC? It's just one of the scrolls. My DC? Is 17. Ah, shit. I thought we were taking him out. I mean-- LAURA and Yeah. I mean-- I think I'll cast-- No. I mean, he's got me grappled. I can't do Sanctuary, right? He's already got me. That's a bonus action. Uh, no, the Sanctuary is a bonus action. All right, I'll cast Sanctuary on-- on myself. (choking sounds) You're tearing me apart. (yells) 15. This is a powerful creature. Trinket has to save us all. Marisha argues with herself and loses. Oh, wow. Wow! Pfft. Still grappled, yes? I feel like I should not be here, but there's no way I can break free. He's super strong, and I'm not. So-- (muffled) Okay! Okay. On dexterity saves. I will rip off-- I will rip off another patch. I'm just using all my tricks. I will rip off another patch and use, because I'm touching it, I will use Vampiric Touch. LIAM, LAURA, and I think that's a touch spell, right? Shit. Aw. So the lower of those two. MATT and I can't use Luck on the lower of those two? Oh. Okay. Okay, that's better. Still not gonna be enough. Plus my spell attack bonus? Is that what, how--? That's still not gonna be enough. So that's 20? Oh! That's not a lot That's not a lot. Oh, nine, 14! Nice! Okay. Y'know, small but okay. And once again casting, recasting Sanctuary on myself. Because it went away when I did that. No, well, I don't know, but it goes away when I attack him. Well, it would have gone away either way, right? Oh, I can? Oh, well then, I'll just keep it going. Yes, I do, I do. So I do have to cast it again. Okay. I have both on. That's, we got that one already. We don't know where the next one is. You found it? (sings) That's me in the ocean SAM, TALIESIN, and Percival! Take this down.. Did it make its wisdom saving throw when it attacked me? Well then, yes it did. (all laugh) Does it lose its grip on us? (sings) That's me in the kraken... Now that Vax and Keyleth are gone, do you guys hear the faint flapping of wings and moaning? Lodestone! I will say this, I know this for a fact, that it says in the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master will help you select a fey creature. (all yell) Does it say it? Okay, it says the DM has creature statistics. Who can look up the stats first? Yeah. Sea hag! Sea hag is a fey. Two challenge. Sea hag! And get eaten. Totally working. Yeah, no, it's great. Cast Hunter Shark on it. Oh no. Oh no. Yes. Part of the system? It must be part of the plan. You're all seasoned veterans, right? This is all part of the plan, right? (screaming) Caligo, take me away! Oh my God. Well, I saw Percy cut his way out of the tentacle, so I will try to do the same. I can move my hands, right? Okay. Then I will reach into my magic bag and pull out a vial of acid, and slam it on the tentacle and see if I can burn through the tentacle. Oof. Oof! Terrible. Yeah. 12. Damn it. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. And then as my bonus action, I will say to Percy, Percival, take this down! I, Taryon Darrington, being of sound mind and body, hereby do not leave my belongings to anyone, but prefer to be buried with them. (all laugh) That's gonna be extra damage to you, Groggy-pants. Plus 25. 43. Yeah. I see him vomit, and I'm like, you and me both, buddy. (all laugh) What are you down to? Constitution. 25! 'Cause it's shark week. Wait, friendly shark! (all laugh) Oh, shark ally! Oh, friendly bear? Never mind, friendly bear. (all laugh) Gills and full movement. Does the shark get an attack? Laura, attack! Laura! Trinket! Yeah, but can still attack. You said something earlier about dexterity saving throws? Five. Yes. I mean, we're just trying to leave at this point. So I will once again try my acid trick, and this time try to hit it and pull another bottle out and smash it on the tentacle. Oh, where'd it go? That's shitty. So I'll use Luck. Oh, better. 20. It's 7d6, right? 22. All right, for my bonus action I just say, oh, friendly shark! (all laugh) Right now, somewhere in the world, Scanlan is eating a like calamari and going-- (all laugh) Huh, that's weird. Little acidy there. So brave! You and your fucking lodestones! There's a water snake in there. They can swim really fast, and I know because I tried to turn into one when we were in the dragon. They have like a 40 swimming speed or something. Young sea serpent that can swim 60 feet? I don't know what that is. Oh no, that's huge, that's a huge monstrosity, she can't do that. Can't do that, no. We'll do it live! Ooh. Matt. We're eels. Eels. Hey! I did pretty good. Matt hates everything right now. (sings) Can't stop the eeling! Oh, Matt hates us. Ugh. You know what, this is like an electricity between you guys. He throws water at us. Snakes have, like, two hit points. You did plenty. Yeah. Nope. Mm-hm. Okay. No one. I need some d8s. Oh! Great. I mean, I'm grappled, right? So. Oh. Okay. 12. Natural one. (all groan) Okay. I reach into my magic satchel, this time pulling out a powerful healing potion, which I drink by myself. Okay. 14, 21-- Uh-huh. (laughs) 35. Yeah. Yeah. Just sort of gently weep. Yeah, just kind of weep softly. I'll do one more Sanctuary on myself! That's my last spell. It's not! Oh, well then-- But I haven't attacked him in a while. I did. I did. We just gotta get out of here. (all laugh) Don't kill it, get us out of there! Get outta there. 11. What does that mean? We're just pushed away? About everyone. Like, everyone. Fucking kraken. Do I get slammed into that thing? That's a different tentacle. (accented) Over the rock? You got swallowed? Are you dead inside of it? Or just inside of it? He'll be fine. He'll be fine! Yeah, 'course. Ooh. Ooh. One of them's around my neck. I mean, I mean-- I mean-- No! No, I have-- my Hail Mary I did on my first turn. I'm going to try to break free. I will put my finger up right next to-- against the tentacle, and just use that Ring of the Ram, and just try to punch through it. I regained three. I have all three charges. 12 plus nine is 21. Oh wait, disadvantage, shit. That's less. That's 17. Terrible. I mean, I don't have any potions, or anything, I-- nope, that's it. You're the naga. You're a whale right now. No. Alter Self doesn't do that. (laughs) For sure. Just heal yourself. Oh boy. 12! Great. Eight plus five is-- -- eight plus five is 13, you just took 13 hit points. Retali-tali-tah? To what? Being pulled around. (laughs) Thanks, Laura. Nailed it! The shark? Hello, shark friend! Aquatic ally! Ooh! Wow. I can't hear anything. (laughs) I can't really see the layout-- is it my turn, by the way? I can't really see the layout of that rock, can I see through it? Is there an under that I can-- Well, ball sack. I can't move very fast now, can I? Can I wiggle through, under the little outcropping there, and get to the other side? Do I have a clean line of sight on him? Yeah. Okay. I mean-- I can't really-- If I shoot the thing, the people inside will die. (nervous laugh) Nuh-uh. I don't think so They're gonna die. I mean-- Wow. Is there a part of the kraken I can see that looks like I can do damage to it without hurting the main-- what is that, the thorax? (laughs) All right, well, then I will take off a diamond and blast it with a Prismatic Spray. Yeah, yeah, except half of the things won't do anything to it. I'm sure it makes it. Yeah, of course it makes it. Do I roll a d8? Or wait, to choose what kind of beam? I mean, no tentacles are holding anything right now, right? All right, so-- Just the kraken. Five? Oh, cold! That's good. Doesn't have resistance to that, right? Ten, right? TALIESIN and Eight, 14, 19, 30, 35. (groans) I can't do a-- rip off a patch and take a potion, can I, as a bonus? It's a patch potion. Yeah. (laughs) I just chew on the patch. (laughs) Percy's having a Mai Tai somewhere. 11! This is not gonna go well, guys. (nervous laugh) We got nobody else on the field. -- points. Hey Keyleth, you're alive! That thing do anything? Oh. That shark is our most effective weapon. What can you turn us into? (sings with the background music) Guys, I think this is one of our tightest games. The shark is literally the most dangerous thing we have. What if the shark gets the how do you want to do this? Oh my Jesus. Ah, wait, is Little Elf Boy alive? And Grog just ran away from him? Okay. Nope. Nope. Nope (laughs). Can't do it. Is it my turn? I mean, that I would love to do. (nervous noises) Nope, I got nothing. Prismatic Spray will kill everybody else-- ring of the ram's dead-- I can't throw anything that far, right? He's like 40 feet away from me? 50 feet away? How far am I? I can't throw something 50 feet underwater, and I can only move 15 feet. (laughs) There's very little I can do-- I will say "crossbow" and change my thing, my rod, into a crossbow-- And nock the poison bolt and shoot it. I'll also move 15 feet-- Okay. (mock-sobbing) It was a one. (all laugh) But when I moved Matt, I want to move toward it, not away. The kraken. The three of you, wait, you, who, and who? Oh, the shark. 18. It's fine, you're not there. (exasperated sigh) Fuck. On that tentacle! 18. Dead. He's right near you. You don't even like me. Wait! Sh! He's doing stuff. Going right past me. I love it. I love it. Full movement? -- got the other lodestone. Fuck you guys. Sure. 50? You can dash and get 60. Your potion of haste. Yeah, sure you do. What's your speed? Yeah, so go over there and heal me, fucker! (all laugh) Oh, okay, I will. Science bros, man! That's a 20. (sings along with the background music) Why don't you roll for it, Travis? 11? Automatic death fail. So you get any attacks, Groggy? Mm-hm? Okay. I can heal you! That was terrible! First death? He's dead! That's not good! I've learned a lesson! Always carry an insurance policy with me. So, in a way, we won!
