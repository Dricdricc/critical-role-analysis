Enter promo code "Sam reads these ahead of time. Just kidding, that doesn't exist, but that's what "happens when I don't read the notes ahead of time." That was very funny, crew! Very funny! The crew got me! That's amazing! They got me! Well, that's fine. Well, I had prepared something, should I do it anyway? All right, I need a little slow snap from everybody, because this is a beat poem. Here it is Hey daddy-o, you get hip to some knowledge, it's up from the school of hard knocks, not some stuck up college, I know the Man's gonna try to shut me down, lock me up, send me off to Vietnam, but I've got to speak the truth, little hepcats and kittens, because that's who I am. See right here is a box of things that corporate America wants you to buy, wants you to toe the party line! Cut your hair, shave your goatee, and subscribe! But me and the Ginchee guys down at Vitamin Village say no, you dig? No to the fat cats, the stick suits, and the company pigs! We're dragging our cigs and take a swig of moonshine. Dump this crate on the floor and look at this so-called-- actually, it's really cool stuff; it's some really awesome stuff-- Doctor Strange! That cat is swell! Fantastic Beasts looks crazy as hell! The box can fold out too, and that's jazzy! Ignore what I said before, I was just spazzing! So yeah! Loot Crate, steal my soul, give me a discount, using CriticalRole! (cheering) And they trolled me! It was this close! Yeah! We were sending them off to be sold. No, I was holding the chain and they stepped forward. Narrator slash Dungeon Master? What are those guards? There's guards in the city. Is that building made of sharp spikes that if we destroyed the building it would kill the bad guy? A lot going on this roll. 13. I'll be dead by the time I go. That was great. You killed him. Yeah, it's like a parrot on a pirate's shoulder. And in charge. Just get them all wet. Go (blubs). Or else they're wet? What happens? Ooh, in water. Nice! You got some bonus shit to do? Yo, you got some bonus shit? Okay. Let's all leave except for Grog. We'll tell your story, Grog. Am I heroic now? What does that mean? What do I do? I add two hit points to myself? I get two hit points back. And I'm immune to fright. (cackles) Like always. Guys, we're winning! He hasn't even done anything. He's pretty weak. He's just sitting there, taking it. Just sitting there. Pit fiend's turn. I let go. I don't let them in. I'm doing better. I'm doing better than I was before this fight started. How high up is the pit fiend? And how far away am I from him? Oh shit. Can't even get close enough to do shit. I can move, but my move is nothing. It's 25. I haven't gone yet. Okay, I am too far away to do anything and don't really want to get in closer. I will get a little bit closer so I am in range to inspire Keyleth. And I will inspire her with a randomly selected limerick from this disgusting book that Taliesin gave me. Okay. They're all horrible. Okay, ready? Nope, that's disgusting. Wow. Okay. Sure. Maggie is such a sad sack of shit That no one will tickle her tit. It would make her so glad To be had by a lad. Her drawers cream at the thought of it? Taliesin, what did you give me?! I will cast Bigby's Hand! And make it an Interposing Hand between Keyleth and the pit fiend. So now he'll just attack me instead. Does it stop him from moving towards her? Is that how it happens? It's like a wall. Oh shit. It's probably super strong. So what does that mean? It's a roll? Shit! Well, that didn't do much. Yes. Can you please do this as Ashley, please? She just texted! She said, "I have a power that kills all evil people around me." The fiend? She's still in set makeup! Maybe, but maybe not. She's in half cover. So many things, guys. Guys, Dungeons and Dragons. (singing) Her head is on fire! He passes. My servants start instinctually stroking you. Touching your hair. It's all they know. Burning down the grit. Just say, like, 50. Piercing? The explosive barrel that certainly won't explode. Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. I'm going to use Cutting Words on that one. I'm going to try to distract. I'm going to yell up at the thing, we never decided where you would send the check for those boys! My address is 1 Greyskull Keep, Emon, 90210, courtesy of Fran√ßois Bertrand Jean-Luc Australia! But you should really forward it to Percival von Fredrickstein von Musel de Rolo! 12 points. Vax just died. I can't see any of our fucking opponents. This sucks! We won, guys! They left! No thanks. Shit. As my bonus action, I will have Bigby lift me up as high as I can go. See if I can see any of these fuckers. Yes. 60 foot movement. It takes a couple feet to get to me, too, right? Oh, I can see them now? Oh, that's great! How far away are they from me? (softly) Fuck. All right, I will-- shit. I don't care about the fucking erinyes thing. If I take a lightning shot at the pit fiend, will I hit Vax? Can I get it so close to him that he's frightened for a second? It's such a weak attack, though. Shit. Shit! All right, sure, I'll take it. I'll do a Lightning Bolt-- No! I'm not, I'm going to hold my attack until one of them gets closer. I'm going to hold a spell. Do I have to declare it now? Shit. Shit. I will hold Otiluke's Resilient Sphere until the pit fiend comes within range. The pit fiend. Keyleth, your hair's still on fire. Where you going, Vex? As she floats away, I try to grab her butt. Looking pretty rough? Let him do his parkour, people. Maybe she has a nametag. Stay true to yourself, Taliesin. Mine's first. Handcone up, yes. What was the lower of those two rolls? Because I have advantage. That's my DC. Fucking shit! Except I'm falling, because that was a concentration spell. Bigby's gone. My concentration save? Nine points! Yeah, Keyleth! Do I get any kind of athletic move? Am I in the lava? Bye! I'll take lava, bye! Aaah, the lava, I can't concentrate! Matthew? Would I have the wherewithal to see what's going on and try to-- Well, some of the attacks, they add more poison to it. Scatter die! What is that? We're having a fight! Oh, oh sorry. Wait, but she did something. Just three more natural 20s. Me? What happened to Percy? Oh, because I was holding my turn. So now we're up to me? Okay. Oh, great, this is fun. I'll stand up out of the lava. There's a guy above me, right? The pit fiend? Wow, that's fun. Yep, okay, sure. Wait, who's dead? Okay, I'll Healing Word the dead person, the Vex. I will sing to her, (singing) Don't you give up, no, no, no! I won't give up, no, no, no! Let me heal you! Let me heal you! That's a d4 plus six. That's so weak. Okay, you got seven points. I will move away from the sniper fire, so where Taliesin used to be, where Percy used to be. That's fine, just as long as the sniper can't get me. No thank you. How high, he would be--? Oh. Is there anything I can hide behind? Can I hide behind Pike? Jump in the lava? Okay, let's just say that, shit. Yep, I don't know what to do. Well, if I can't move out of the way then I'll try to Lightning Bolt the pit fiend. I mean, we're trying to kill the pit fiend, right? That's not going to do shit to a pit fiend. Pit fiend would be 45 feet up, right? So I cannot, because I can only get 30 feet. I could hop and do it. I will hold my action until the pit fiend comes in range. Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. Am I affected by this? I'm going to get health? Yeah. Well, I hit myself by falling out of the sky. Do I get the temporary hit points that Pike had granted me, two turns ago? She gave me five. Okay, great. But I look really cool with a fire beard and stuff, so. I look cool. Mid-battle bribery! Thanks for abandoning us! So we all saw Vex wake up, throw a bag of money, and walk into my house. Very unusual. With a broom dragging behind her. Oh boy, guys, this is a fight. 12. Guys, why did we come to the fire plane? Maybe the lava is a secret passage! Grog, you should swim down and find out! Guys, should I read another limerick while he's doing this? He passes, again. I'm going to construct a small lever system. Unless it is trapped in my sphere. 21 if I'm using my cone, which was up for my last one. I did not Cutting Words on this one, so he's got advantage. I'm going to Cutting Words that, with my reaction. That's a hit? So I'm going to Cutting Words that. I'm going to sing, (singing) Your evilness is killing me, and I must confess, I want to flee! But when you see me you lose your mind, baby it's a sign! Pit fiend, baby, now you're mine! Three. Fuck. I'm going to draw Mythcarver and look at it. Admire it for a moment. Turn to Pike, who's right next to me, and Healing Words her with just a simple touch. Can I demonstrate on you, Taliesin? I'm going to do this. Just that. They've never worked a day in their life. Ten points of healing to Pikey. But that changes things! Fuck, I stick to the plan. Hand Cone up. I'm going to try and Dominate what's-his-butt. The pit fiend. Yes. It's at disadvantage, so it's a straight roll, but I know it's going to be pretty tough. It's a wisdom save. Damn it, nothing's working. Pike is dead-- Yeah, but I can't leave her. The thing is, I've made a promise to stay alive. So I'm going to run away. Toward the mansion. Sure. Oh, sure. That's not good. 21. I don't want to go in the mansion. I want to stay outside. I'm going to go back to my barrel, around where Taliesin was before. Hide back there. Yeah. You're in the mansion. I do this and say, you wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you? Why, why! I mean, yeah. No! Matches my beard, now. Those don't reach into the mansion. Got to flank. It's all good. You're going to die anyway. It doesn't matter, right? We're all going to die. Loot Crate, Loot Crate. Are you unconscious, too? I haven't done anything to him, by the way. Not a thing. Three times! But I've done nothing! All I've done is perform for him, really. I'm going to Cutting Words the mace attack. Right? Yeah, what? Yep. Jesus, well, I'm Cutting Words-ing it, but it's not going to do much unless I roll a lot. I'm going to Cutting Words him with a lovely limerick. There was a young fellow named Brewster, who said to his wife as he goosed her, "It used to be "grand, but just look at my hand. You ain't wiping as clean as you used to." (sounds of dismay) It's bad. It's two. Oh yeah. Nothing has worked on this motherfucker. Nothing! I still draw Mythcarver, and then I put it away. I don't hit things with swords. If I did something with everything that vibrated on my body, I would be doing stuff all day long, right. I did in the last turn. It's still out. I'm not picking up any signs from him. I'm going to bonus action heal myself, Healing Word level two. Okay, two of these. So that's nine points. Great, and then I'm going to let the sword guide me. I'm going to position it around my belt and thrust forward at the beast. I don't know what to do now. Yes. Okay. First one is 24. I think. The second one is more than that. I'm not even going to do the math. Third one's even more than that. I'm not going to do the math. The fourth one is-- Well this is cocked, so I'm going to redo that one. It was a ten plus nine, 19. Okay. So we're up to 16. Not very much. Ooh, that's good. 29 total. I get to kill the pit fiend? As I slice, I want to slice one wing off, then the other wing off, and then, as I stab him straight through the heart, I will say no one messes up a deal with Francois Australia! I drop to my knees, start crying, and say, I'm so amazing! I have the power! The power of Greyskull! All right, so I'll-- shit. That's it! Oh shit, so, there's a guy. There's a guard, right? Oh, shit. I can't do anything to him. So I'll just yell at him, he was an assassin, sent to kill the Sultan! 34. That's 18 plus 16, whatever that is. I got something! But I've got to wait my turn. Every time you try to pick me up, I say no. Right away, Grog. Handcone up. Oh! Yeah, I got something. That's a book full of shit limericks. I take one step closer to the efreet, putting me within 30 feet of him. I will hand cone up, and I will sing to him to try to charm him. I'll sing (sings) my Grog don't like you, and he likes everyone! And I should have known that you'd try to run! But I got so caught up in my spells I didn't see that you were trying to rat me out! But I can't do that right now! I don't know. So I'm going to cast Modify Memory at sixth level. Ten minutes have not gone by! This whole thing's taken two minutes, right? Fuck! There's nothing in that book that says he can't! There's something in this book that says something much worse. "Abuses of the Clergy"? 21. I'm telling him You heard this fiend pledge to murder the Sultan. It's a Sultan, right? You heard this fiend pledge to murder the Sultan and you, joined with us, defeated him. You are brave. You are strong. You should tell everyone this. Not as brave as you, sir! Noodle arm! Yeah, that's a great idea! Do that. 50,000?! Nice boots. You have so many fucking boots. No one wears shoes in this world? Only boots? I can sing a song to heal you all by 1d12. Is that right? Okay, I will sing a song. I will sing (singing) Heal thee! With a song, heal thee, all night, all night, all night long. Heal thee. It's a 12! Hit dice, huh? Okay, lots of math going on. I'm up to 85. Sorry, I'll stop playing. Wait, did we get their names yet? We could leave them here while we go do our business. We need to get our armor. We did do this together, and we didn't do anything that you wouldn't have done for us. We have a wine cellar. Not a fellow! Not a fellow. A lady. That means a lot, Vax. Oh, upside-down Spider-man! Oh! That's not the first upside-down elf man kiss I've ever had, but it's probably top three. I can't take that much damage! (grunts weakly) Just curious, what do you say we play one hand? TALIESIN, LAURA, and Oh, okay. All right. I'm going to hold up a towel. We've got to read it to you. Laura will read it in Ashley's voice. Are we going to text it to Ashley to read? Okay, text it to Ashley. This is the speed of internet. Can you read what it says, Ashley? Yes, please, read it. What?! So if someone kills her, they hurt more. Holy shit. What happens if we all put them together? Do we become Voltron? Let's try to stack ourselves into some sort of weird pyramid. Do we need to check in with creepy guy? Really? We don't need to check in? I don't want him coming for us. Don't we owe him something? This does not seem like a good idea. If we are in mid-Thordak battle and he shows up to collect, we're fucked! Can you send those children back? In case. Then we'll settle this. We don't want Garth from Wayne's World to have anything on our heads. That's it? What a nice, sweet man! Matt, I just got a four insight check, as well. Where exactly would you like us to put these? Are you talking about fingerless gloves made of dragonscale? Zaafin? Oh yeah, the kids. Nine? Okay. Daxio really needed a restart anyway. We can plan our attack from somewhere else. Hey, guys, we're here to save your fort. We're going to just step away for two days. (laughter) Well, one's going up tomorrow. We're also doing a Thanksgiving costume contest. (laughter)
