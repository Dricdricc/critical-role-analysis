Oh, that'd be so good. Yeah. Yeah, we'll have to flag that off, probably. Marisha Ray? He's taking over all the shows. Oh, the Continental? So we should watch that so we know-- I have something to say, Liam. I don't have an announcement, and neither does Ashley. So Ashley, how you doing? I'm pretty good. (gasps) Does everyone else need to leave? Sam Riegel. It's not a dick, Laura. Oh. That's nice. Are they my kids? Oh, thank god. (laughter) First of all, I appreciate you making this all about me, as it should be. I'm going to try to stand up. Is that a thing I can try to do? Can I sit up in my weird four-poster? Well, I'm looking, what was poking me in the back? (gasps) Bixby! Did he have a collar or anything that I could identify? Is it about the same size as little Bix? Yeah. How far are the children from me? Are they asleep? Do they look like they're alive and asleep? Okay, I'm going to try to stir one of them, whoever's closest. Who's closer? The older one. The girl, right? Wait, I'm a kid? (whispers) Oh, we're kids! Muppet Babies! There's a little blond boy? I'm Sam! Do we know each other? Do I recognize her? Sam Riegel! TV's Sam Riegel! Who are you? Who are you? You're too fat to be Laura! (laughter) Well, that's Taliesin. (laughter) Yeah, I saw him in Mr. Mom. He looks the same. We were just fighting Conan, we beat him. Yeah, hi. I know, my teeth are really big. I haven't gotten any work done. I'm going to pull out the skull. Huh? Oh yeah! Little hands. I think the dog died, when we got younger somehow. Oh gosh. Here, hold my hand, and we'll pull each other and try to pull each other up and out of here. We'll all make a weird kid triangle. I got an 11. We've got to look for our friends and figure out what the hell's going on. And last thing I remember, we were doing a voiceover session and all hell broke loose, right? Yeah. He cut my arm off! I let go of her hand, because girls are icky. Okay, we'll help. Okay, let's go. All right, let's go! But wait! We don't know anything about where we are, so we should look and stealth, maybe? And sneak over there? So as not to awaken a beast? Okay! Oh, you know? Okay! Let's go! 13. That's Laura and Travis. From I Shot The Sheriff's Mom or whatever it was? Yeah, let's do that for the next three hours. You touched a wiener? Find sticks! We're going to look for sticks and rocks. A wet dress. Yeah. You just got all wet and muddy, and now-- Were they with us? They just appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared. They did, but they looked super scary. Surprise attack. We're all rolling for initiative? Seven! Seven. Wait, is this Laura or Taliesin? Any rocks around? Big rocks? I'm going to grab one and just hit it in the skull. Okay. Nine. Oh yeah, it was her turn, actually. You killed it! Come back! It's dead! We have to go after them. Wait, you're going to tie the animal to your belt? Listening to Moana. Ooh! So cute! (laughter) We were theater children. So, eight, nine-ish? Maybe? I guess so. Wait, are we together again? Something's going on. We're in a weird forest swamp. There are weird demon dogs that are attacking us-- Was it? Yeah, everyone's freaking out and Travis has reverted back to his behavior as a 15-year-old or something. We're all normal-thinking, but not Travis. (laughter) Yeah, I was on Broadway. Dark. More cats. Yeah, I mean, we were fighting Conan O'Brien and then we got pushed forward in time. That's all I remember. And also, Travis tried to kill me. Well, you will, statistically speaking. No. We need weapons, we need somewhere to go. Oh god. I'm going to just grab a handful of rocks. I'm going to hide in a creek. I'm hiding, as well. Three. You have spells? Oh my god. 14. This is it. Which one is she? Okay. Yeah! No DMing! He's going to cast 5th-level Explode Cats. Vicious Mockery. Me? Which one am I? Okay, I go forward and to the left. Am I within throwing range? Yeah. I can hold my action until they get in range. Yes. I will get ready. I'll cock my hand. Cock rock. They're cats. It was a little standoff, there. All of them? Where are you? Oh, that's not going to get near you in the next round. You're a hundred feet away from them. To strangle? Is that within throwing range for me? I'm throwing! One. (laughter) Sorry! Three. I don't know. Oh, one. I'm sorry! I'm a musical theater person! It's my turn? Oh, it's my turn again. We've cycled around? Okay. Are those guys out of range? All right, I'm going to try to right my wrongs and get in range and throw another rock at the middle one. For Bixby! Two. (laughter) Yeah. Is there anything I can hide behind? Is that a thing? And they're going to get me. I'll just go huddle with Marisha and Matt. Stick! Stick! Stick! Which way did he go? Let's go! I'm pretty good at that, at tracking, I think. I don't know, I'm a ranger. Isn't that what rangers do? Oh shit. I had a treehouse in the woods growing up. I mean, it was right behind my house. Yeah! Because-- Because I'm a ranger and rangers get advantage in their favorite terrain. Okay. 13. I think he's that way. Follow me, everyone. I didn't shower much. Oh, parking lot entry gate. Wait, does that mean we're in an old overgrown parking lot? I'm going to dig it out. Or I'll try. Those four posts were the tower! What was left of it. Well, we're in Burbank. (laughter) Say what? Well, we're at Warner Brothers. Well, wait, if these are security booths here, maybe they have some handcuffs or something that we can get in there. Sure, why not. Yeah, but we know the direction. We know where the tower is. We know where the booth is. We just go that way. You're a very smart young man. I mean, we can see into LA and it's not, right? We've got one option we've got to follow this old guy! Why are we going to Bob's Big Boy?! Didn't he go north on Hollywood Way? Just Ashley. What are you, Ashley? Guys, I'm leading this party. Focus on me! 17. Yes. Oh shit! I saw him! Guys, he's that way! We should go that way, but maybe flank, right? I played paintball as a kid, so we can flank. Come at him from two directions. But you have the mind of a current-day Travis. No! I'm flanking! I'm flanking around. One way in. We're all going in together, I guess. Commercial casting directors. It's everything we've ever faced. As, as we roll, I look down to see if-- Are we any older, or are we the same age? I check if I've got pubes. Do I have pubes? Ten! You know, I think we can take them, guys. I think we can take it. Wait. They won't come into the water. Maybe we just stay here. The whole monster thing? I'm going to also join them on the beach. And similarly, I'm going to hold up the skull of Bixby and say We serve the darkness as you do! We will do your bidding if you will let us! Please spare our lives so that we may serve yours! 14. That's good. Woobie, woobie, woobie! I mean, those are tendrils? What are those things, those are just arms? With what, a rock? I'm going to use my movement and my action to dash-- At the demogorgon? And I'm going to try to kill it with love and give it a big hug around its leg and say, I forgive you! Yeah. But love conquers all! I'm a child, Matt! 16 plus-- there's no number written there. Nice. She's hardcore. He's looking pretty rough. Me? I'm partially naked. I'm hugging a demogorgon. I would like to climb up a little up his leg. And just say Kill them, but save me. I will fan you and get you food, and whatever. Just kill them all. They're nothing, just save me. Just save me. That's it. Do I have to roll on anything? Do I need to roll? All right. Then I got nothing. At disadvantage? Well, it's a natural one. Who's left? My plan is working; I'm still alive! How do you want to do this? She's a rogue. That's nice! I climb up higher. Sure. Natural 20! All the way up to its ear. I can sing you show tunes! I know doo-wop songs! I will do your bidding forever if you just let me live! I can work with this! True. Oh my god, she disappeared. We're dead! End of session. I dreamt that I was late to a plane. (laughter) Good game, good game. Nope. Darkness. Such a good actor. I guess people see us as super-old. Oh, you don't wear these? We're professionals, we're gonna do this. (yells in pain) Pickup. (yells in pain) Pickup. (yells in pain) "Oh, god!" Man, her South African accent is terrible. (laughter) Yeah, I got it now. Sorry, Neil. I didn't know if it was "oh lord!" or "oh god!" I got in my head, and that's not a place you want me to be. Hey, can I see you for a second? Laura's accent is really throwing me. That's gonna be fixed later, right? Okay, okay. I can do this. (yells in pain) "Oh, god! Oh, god!" What are we fighting? What are we fighting? Ashley has a prop knife. Three. And there's robits? What is it? What does it look like? There's a diesel engine. Punch the camera. I'm going to go assist Matt in what his plan was. So are we grabbing the same thing and pulling? I'm gonna pull hard. Real hard. Yeah, sure. Okay, terrible. I do. I'll use it. That helps. Plus strength? Okay, that's ten. Oh wait, no. Five plus one plus six is 12. Hey, it's good. Two. Liam's dead. That's okay. He slowed us down. You okay there? 'SAM'. 'FORGIVE M--' For killing people. Does everything reset? Noted. Me? I mean, I don't really know what these symbols and messages mean, so like the piece of scaffolding that fell down like this, can I run and sort of jump on it and do it again? Okay. Four. (laughs) And then I'll spend the rest of my action/bonus or whatever looking at those screens to see if they say anything to me. What? 'HUSBAND'? (whispers) It's Liam. It's Liam. We're gonna get potato chips during this? Don't I get an attack of opportunity? Yes. I'm gonna just try to kick it. 11 plus something. Everything's wet in Liam's world. I'm gonna run as fast as I can up to the big guy. Yeah. Even closer-- That's okay. I just want to talk to it. And I just want to say to it, Liam! If you can hear me in there, hey buddy. Let's knock this off and just record our podcast, okay? We haven't done an episode in like three months. We should just do one of those instead! We got recording equipment right here, huh? What do you say, pal? 'FIND ME'. That means find Liam. We have to find Liam. We just heard a scream, we didn't see him die. He had so many more games to make. Not anymore. No! Inspiration. You are adorable. Well, you were. Who, Liam? Oh god. He said "find me" but he's dead. I guess I didn't see what you saw. I'm going to kick the robot in the robot nuts. Yeah. 19. With what? What am I rolling, a d4? One. Okay. For my bonus action, I will say, please hit it in its glowing naughty bits, please. Oh, wait. Everyone's gone to Crafty. Just awful. Don't you still have an inspiration? I don't know. Did Matt inspire you or Taliesin? You worked with Spielberg?! Wow. You are on a rampage about backing up data. I'm gonna use my-- Because the robot is dead. As far as I know, Liam is dead. I'm going to use my ranger senses-- I'm going to look and see if I see anything out of the ordinary. Any sign of a hidden door or a chamber that I missed before. (gasps) I come in my pants. I book it to the door, and I say as always, follow seven-year-old me! Leave it. You can't read that. What are you, a computer? Fuck Liam. He's dead. I'm going to leave my picture and resume on Neil's body. (laughter) Somebody needs an actor or character actor. Running forward. Yeah. What are you talking about? You're a weiner. You've been running after everything that you've seen. I'm a tracker! I'm running. I only have one. Oh. Okay, sorry. (panting) When I smile, I create a dim light with my teeth. Probably two miles, right, Travis? Your crazy powers? What?! Oh, it's scaly teflon. Is it adamantium? Sure! Two miles. Come on, Matt! Jesus! Let's go. Let's go. Yeah! Yeah, On me, guys. On me. We're going to go on in. Yeah. We're going in! I'll step forward and say, hey, dude. Can you hear us or talk to us? Yeah. Break you? Break the glass? But we have to kill him to save ourselves. Hi, old man Liam. But who will I do All Work No Play with anymore? We didn't even get to 20? That's so pathetic. I could get a new cohost. I mean, Taliesin's charming. I'll do a solo show, and I'll take outtakes, and I'll make some sort of a Liam generator. He'll just sound sad all the time. It'll be just like you. I think we all have to hit the glass together, and I think that this is something that is not at all metaphorical for something Liam is going through in real life. I think this is just in the D&D game. No, we're going to do this. We're going to all hit the glass together. No, he's got something to say! Well, should we wait, or do we strike? Well, then we just-- I'll also put my hand on the glass and join hands with these guys and say, thank you for guiding us here and through this all. You've been a trusted friend, and if we are all one person together, you have been our heart, and it will certainly break to say goodbye to you, but thank you for letting us go the way that you have. (imitating Laura) "I'm barfing right now, so--" (whispers) We have to kill him. Are we just going to let this happen? All right. So this is all about me, right? That was your therapy.
