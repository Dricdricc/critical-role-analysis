30 sets? Oh. The dice are gone. Oh wow! 19. Wow, we all did pretty well. We're all between 15 and 24. We have a backup bear. (laughter) It's rather stuffy in here, so we should open a window. I'll run up to right in front of Vex and slap a window on the wall. I've run out of doors. (laughter) It's a casement window, so I have to go-- (squeaking) (laughter) Well, he can't fit through a window. (laughs) It's two feet by four feet, I believe? I'll just say, Doty! Go back up Grog! I don't have any idea? Oh. Semaphore. Each one of those squares in the room with him are ten feet squares, right? The big squares are ten, yeah. (sings) Come to my window! MATT and Wait, he took damage, though! Because he's immune to magic or something? Is that what's going on? Oh! It's okay. What're these words? Oh, shnikes! Ursa Major. Was it this thing? Does he take 21 points of fire damage? Immunity? Not just resistance, immunity? I am so weak. You guys want a window somewhere? How tall is the room? So there's a little window on top. Okay. Well, it's something, isn't it? Jesus. I'm nobody! Is it just a cage or is there a door on the bear cage? That's not going to happen. Okay, our last fight, I had hasted myself. That was more than a minute ago, though, right? Okay, well then, I'll go into the place. Oh. Sorry! It's hard to see with my helmet! No peripheral vision. Oh my god. No! I don't have anything! How far can I move, hasted? You just double your movement. Okay. So my movement's 30, so I can move in there with him? Okay. I'm just going to go, (yells) and run into the fire. Advantage on dexterity saves. Oh. All right, no. That's nine. Halved. My Helm of Brilliance. I'm just going to say, "Hi. It's a little warm in here. Here, cool off." And I'll throw acid on him. (laughter) I don't know what I'm rolling. 14. This is to hit? It's magic? I don't know, how does this work? It's a vial of acid. I never know if this is a spell attack bonus sort of a thing. The DC of the spell is 17. So he resists it completely. No problem. Oh. All right. I think I get a bonus still, maybe? I will cast Sanctuary on myself. Okay, that was my action. Ooh, okay. I will stab him with my lance. Ooh, that's going to hit. It's a 25. (high-pitched grunt) (laughter) That's 1d12. Thank you very much. That's seven. No wait, I get a plus six. Ooh, and it was a six! That's 13. No, the fire damage is another plus one, but I don't think you'll be adding that. (laughs) Yeah, so 13. I will, and as I do that I also say, Doty-- remember how I said back up Grog? Me! Back up me! (laughter) Oh no. 16 plus-- what's his dexterity?-- zero, so 16. (groans) He's unconscious. I don't know when the last time we rested was but I have down that he only has 30 hit points left. Did he take damage at some point? Oh no! Is he going to melt? He's in the fire, right? Oh god. Is he making some sort of window that someone else could walk over? Good, I'm glad I used that last little thing. (laughter) Oh man. Kill our own guest? That's not a seven. What would've happened to me?! You're not just in the closet over there sorting through file cabinets? Is it big enough to cover his big body? Always. Why does he have disadvantage? Good day to you, sir. Do you know my father? Oh boy. Yeah, of course. Doty will save-- Nope. Because I'm hasted, that does not hit. Haha! I have ve-- Ah! Yeah, that hits. Halved. Me? But I'm just a man! Yeah, of course that hits. I'm okay because Marisha reminded me that when I was not here one week, she gave me an extra 17 hit points, which I still have. They're helping me a lot right now. Matt? On the first of those attacks, I have Sanctuary. It's just one wisdom roll. I think it's safe to say, even in retrospect. What happened? Oh, it's my turn? Oh, great! You know how sometimes when we're in fights and bad guys can walk around us without incurring damage? I'm going to clock around him, clockwise. Yeah, right there's pretty good. Do I see any-- I can't see out of the ring, right? Ew, what? I'll do that. I'll say, it's been lovely having this time with you in private, but our seven minutes in heaven are up. I need you to leave. I will do the Ring of the Ram at full strength and push him out of his own ring. If it works. That's a one. But I'm feeling Lucky. That's a three. Can I feel really Lucky? No, that's fine. Does it fire? It just misses. I've lost it all there. Oh Jesus, I like my face. Still hasted. For my second thing, I can only do a melee attack. I can't cast anything, I can't reach into my satchel or anything. Yeah, I could. That's fair. I will spend the rest of my turn moving back to where Doty was, picking up his book, putting it in my Bag of Holding so it doesn't burn up. Then crawl into a ball and cast Sanctuary on myself. (laughter) If I don't look, he'll go away! Do you have healing potions? Oh yeah. Doesn't matter, you killed him. Sure. It does. Hits. Yes. Well, crouching. Technically, it has to roll another wisdom save. It lasts for a minute, it's not per attack, actually. He succeeds. Yes. (strangled death noises) And at that point, do all of their necklaces glow? Halved. No. I just like saying that. Hey, that's good. Yay. Oh, sure. Yeah. Can I feel lucky? Oh, that's worse. (laughter) Oh! I had the craziest dream. Oh! Did I kill it? Again? In fear, I stand up and throw my lance at the fire giant. (laughter) That's a 14. Are you seeing this? Are you all seeing this? Oh! Good day to you, miss. I've misjudged you again. No! For pocket change? Would you like me to identify the object? All right. Aye, I'll take a look at it. With magic, or just with size? Well, we did that, no? Yeah, Percy signed it. I drank a healing draught, and I am getting my lance ready, and I'm staying with fucking Doty. I'm staying. I'm going to try to see if I can try to start fixing him. Okay. Well, then I won't do that. He served his purpose. I can't do this. I can't go in there. As we're walking, I'm going to whisper to Percy. Are they going to take all our stuff? I can't do anything without my stuff. Everything? Armor? Helmets? This is the worst. I didn't get my phone call! Oh, wait, do we have the necklace? She's amazing. Every time. Every time. We're in jail. I have no Doty. Who will record my exploits down here? Why am I here if not to record my adventures? No. You're an idiot-- I mean, no thank you, Grog. I lash out when I'm nervous and I don't have my belongings. Of course. You cut your food before you eat it. I take out my rod and make it a dagger and set it on fire. Yes. Oh, I don't. I don't? Where is it? Everything's outside? Shit. I need that shit. Through her bones? Tova, can't you just curse the lock? I'm just rubbing my wrists. Well, why don't we be pigeons that can fucking fly? Let's just walk. I think we should just walk, but if you want to do this, you can. Since bats can't see, maybe we should-- Stealthy. Wait, do we go right? What? 17. I'm Batman. Wait, what? We go straight! We go straight into the wall! As bats-- Oh wow. That might actually miss. Guys, we have one hit point, by the way. 30 feet. It's a 30-foot fly speed. Ooh. Serpentine. Oh boy. Here we go. Four. We do get an attack. Yeah. And a hit is one point of piercing damage. There, bat-bear. Unhittable bats. Bats. We're all bats. Yup, yup. Maybe it's stage right. I'm going to go where she went. And further if I can. Bye! Percy, my necklace is glowing. And I'm not a bat. Does that mean Keyleth's dead? You just rolled it. But we were bats, Matt. That was pretty fine planning. How far away am I? Okay. I'll run back then, I guess. I'll throw acid at one, I guess. The one who looks the meanest. 17. Okay. Give me some sixes. And one more. Boom. Oh, lots. (laughter) 25. All right, I will cast Sanctuary on young Keyleth. In my life. (laughter) That song is not called "Doo-Bop." It's called "Mmmbop." Three more? They know the layout of this prison. Let me do something. I'm going to use my Scroll of Programmed Illusion. Have any creatures talked to us in Common down here? With their mouths, not with their minds? What kind? Okay. Did he work in the prison? Great, chain devil. So I'm going to make a Programmed Illusion. Upon anyone approaching, a chain devil will appear over the dead bodies that we just killed and say, "There were five of them. "They went that way!" And point down the hallway that we just came out of. "Go, get them now! Make "them pay!" (cheering) Jesus, there's another whole fucking map? Two. Which one? Is Sanctuary still working on her? And me. You can reroll ones. Is Sanctuary still on her? On what? My spell DC? 17. Matt, if I may be-- Technically, he can choose another target. No, it just says in Sanctuary you can either fail or he can choose another target. Sorry. Just saying. You have too many dice on there. I mean, we're done. I'll move to Keyleth and say Tova, are you coming with us? You have to, sort of. To another plane of existence. But one without chain golems trying to kill you. How? I'll go next to Keyleth. I can make you invisible. I can make you fly. What would help you get out of here? Sure. A minute. Just one minute. (laughter) It lasts an hour?! Oh! Hey, you can get out with that. Is Vex down? Oh. (laughs) Oh, shitballs. I'm feeling lucky. Thank god. 20. Natural 20. Golden snitch. No problem, guys. Oh. Me? I'm right there, aren't I? Can I bridge the gap somehow? To pull Vax over? Okay, great. Seven points. Okay, yeah. I'll reach like I've never reached before, and say We're brothers forever. Lifelong teammates. Friends. Greystone Keep! Get my robot! Five minutes later, Tova was killed. (laughter) Worst case scenario, she ends the day where she started. And Lumberjanes.
