Not the final episode of the show! You watched it? What does it say on the title there? Volume One? Implying that there's going to be more? What is this? A special edition? Two more editions of the art book! Is that an experience? Is it the Belt of Dwarvenkind?! (yelling) And many more whose names were omitted. For maybe 30 seconds more. Why don't you fly it over? They're dead. Turn around. Let's go back. They're dead. They're unconscious? I have no spells left, so yes. (laughter) Why did you come? You had a vision? Haven't you heard of pulling out? (laughter) We're sitting on the titan now? But still on the Titan? Is he falling? Two. Pregnant?! What? I thought you were gay! Is it falling? Yeah, do that! Zahra has Fly, she can cast Fly on him! 61 seconds. We'll all stay, until we don't have to. Oh, yeah. Shit. Oh god. Yes? Yes? That is my full name, yes. (laughter) I try to get away, but-- You're right! Kinky. Ooh! What? I mean, thank you? Well, I miss doing, well-- Don't see us too soon. I mean, whenever you're near us, you both almost die. So maybe just-- What? No. Well I shit more than your kid will, but other than that, it's like this but with less shit. Thank you. Let's do it. I pull out my gun. (laughter) Let's do this. (yells) (laughter) Natural 20. (machine gun noises) V def. Performance? Come on. 28. I've been watching you. Do we have Locate Object or something? Is it an object? I guess it's inanimate now. Rage dig. Tiamat. Bad, I'm guessing? More than 20. Oh, yeah. She's the dragon god. She? Bad dragons. That's on the to-do list. We'll go find him. Yes. He nodded when he said no. We have more pressing concerns. What? Give what back? The gun? This is my gun. I found it. I found it fair and square; it's my gun. I look so cool. That's a good idea. I love it. All right. It's going to happen. I feel like we should all get a tattoo to commemorate this. I'm going to throw it away. Wrist Pocket! (laughter) Nine. 12. Around the world. It could fall. How many of us can fly? Well, I guess we could take a couple of trips on the carpet. So we can take three trips on the carpet, or something? He beat your scry? That wins. Not now. That could work. Deal with him another day. We'll be okay. Yeah. Let's go. To the platinum temple? Absolutely. Do we know where he teleported off to? Don't worry, it's a big woods. It'll be okay. The proof is we're here and we're alive. Should we say something? You are the leader of your people. Maybe you should say something. You're a leader! Now? We don't even get a night together or anything? We love you, too. Thank you for everything. If you want us to fight her, just say jenga, and we will. I wish I could have done more. She said is there something we can do? It's hard to hear her. Something feels different about the table. I feel like I could have taken her if I had a gun. I'm just saying. All the time. Jesus, you have so many things. Against AC? Oh. (laughs) I'm out. Feels right. (muffled) It's okay. I'm okay in here. Oh, hi. That was a very touching ceremony. Well, I'll just be in here, crying. The golden snitch! Absolutely. Are you not doing this, Grog? Whatever your wishes are, Grog. I'll go along with it. If you wish to keep the sword, that's fine with me. Great. Okay. Sell me on this. He's just flexing his face muscles. No, he does this when he needs to go poo. I've seen him do it. I mean, it's been a hard day. I think we all need a really good bowel movement. Did you get some boon or boost or something? Really conflicted here. He seems totally normal to me. Pike, do you want me to try to stop him? What's going on? Pike, should I do something or no? Why don't I help him fight it? I will cast Suggestion on Grog, using my last level two spell. And suggest that he think long and hard about maybe fighting back against this sword. One more time. He's made his choice. Oh! Vax comes back and kills you. They're holding it for you. Arkhan. Misguided. And he's got another hand that he could chop off too. One in reserve. I was fighting a god. I didn't really catch his name. Away we shall. Oui oui! SAM, TRAVIS, and I've got a thing, actually, I've got to get to. Are you apologizing for something? That's stupid. I never said sorry for leaving! Well, I'm sorry. Sorry I left. That's fair. She's asking for somebody else, I'm pretty sure she wasn't asking for her. I would suggest that we-- there's bars here, right? In Vasselheim? They drink, don't they? Why don't we go find a tavern somewhere and let these people pick up the pieces, and give them their space? Ashley, I just texted you the contract. Yeah. Pike, I have a porno book that I really think I shouldn't have anymore. Can I give it to you to take it away-- Oh, you'll take it? Okay. It's not great. Sure. Yeah. We need to go have some toasts to Vax. LAURA and We can take a day. To whom? Your nearly dead sister. We should toast to Vax'ildan, our fallen member. He's really stealthy. What do you have, Ashley? The most frequently naked. That's true. To Vax. Do we have to check on Greyskull Keep? I don't know. We'll go to Whitestone and figure it out. That's where Kaylie is, right? We assume. Oh, why? You've got to go back to your people? Sure, that makes sense. Pikey-poo, where are you going? Are we transporting tonight? Why don't we chill for a night? Well, of course, but I'm drunk and bloody. Did you have a drink? What can we do? You're such a rebel. Sure. Okay, what is it? What is that? What have you got? I've seen this before, haven't I? I think I was with you when you got the guy rich. Wasn't I? I was with him when he did one of them, though. 15. I'll watch for now. Probably. If we're going to do that, we should go back to Whitestone first. We're traveling now? We're drunk! That's a young boy. Love you. Yeah, you called it. That works. Now or forever? I want to go see Kaylie, I guess, if she's around. Are we hanging out together, or are we breaking off? All right. I'm going to go see Kaylie. Hi. You with a dagger in your hand's always a little scary. Not any-- (yelps) Okay, it frightens me a little. You okay? Good. Surprisingly, yes. We won. Thanks. I'm sorry that I had to go do that. I had to. So what now? Do you want to go back to Ank'Harel and keep criming? I'm so happy I got to see you again. I thought for a second that when we said goodbye, it was the last time. That's true. Only good people die. Yeah. No, I hear you. I don't know if it's for me, either. It was fun. It felt like we were killing time a little bit. There's something else that we should do. I don't know what. Maybe your thing won't be my thing. That's a good idea. Yeah, that's a great idea. We'll train a replacement. Passive income, right? It's the dream. I should have thought of that. That's amazing. Did you finish school? Do you want to? All right. Well, let's do that, then. You go to school. Listen, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, and I don't want you to make the same ones. I love you, and I want to support you in whatever you want to do, at this point. My time has come, and I've done my thing, and my thing is done, and now I want to help you do whatever it is that you want to do. If that means I can be close to you, then great, but if it doesn't, then I'll come visit every once in a while. We made quite a bit of money as the Meat Man. And it's a good sum to get started. You can have the best education. All right. Education for spite. I like that. Sure. Whatever you need. You won't have to worry about me anymore. Thank you. Thank you for coming into my life. I'm so happy. I made so many mistakes, but it turns out that some of them weren't mistakes, after all. I'll snuggle and fall asleep in the room at some point. I'm in my room now? You were wearing eyeliner to our fight? That makes sense. She's letting Grog go first. Yeah. Yes! Make it good. Oh, here's the deck. Negative two to everything. The crew's laughing. Something's bad. Something's very bad. Wait, Pike saw him. You get a reaction. Wait, read it again. Can anything reverse it? Wait, she rolled. She rolled something. Oh, that was her 20 from before. Oh my god, Travis. Why would you do that? Her internet just died. Does she get a reaction or anything? With her 20, she saw! She can't yell? She can't cast something? All right. She rolled a 17. To Grog! He was the dumbest of us all. He was the dumb and the dumb. The halls of Pandemonium? God, you asshole. It's a good side quest for the future someday. Yep. Hand them over. You may lose your belt for this, friend. Percy lost his arm rescuing you! You've learned a lesson that we had to pay for. Pike, can you hear us? Yeah, I texted her the gist of what happened. Well, I may have been fibbing about that part. Nice. Any other things that we need to wrap up for the evening? No! I invoke the third contract. Bring it in. What do you want to do? You mean two weeks ago or are we after-- Oi, Pike. Now that Percy's arm has healed, I'm fine. Yeah. That bugbear came out of nowhere. Don't worry about it. I'm fine. Me too. Thanks for saving us all in that big fight. I care for you, Pike. I've always loved you since the moment I met you and I'm so happy that we became friends as well. Thank you for everything. Thank you for putting up with me when I was a shit and I hope that I've become more tolerable for you. After all that we've been through, I was wondering if I could ask you a question. I have a proposal for you, if you don't mind. Well, now that everything is safe again and back to normal, I was wondering if I could take you on a date. To a restaurant or something, then maybe if it goes well, we could go on another date and that's it. Well then. I'll let you do it! No, you do it! I don't want to-- I take it back! I don't ask you on a date! Oh no! The internet! Can you hear me, Ashley? (groaning) That was a yes. Oh! Sorry, I'm having a text romance with Ashley Johnson right now. No. I'm ready. I can pull myself away from Pike for a second. (clears throat) I have one prepared. Well, she's not here, so I don't know but I wrote down-- Oh god, I love this! My plan, what I wrote down, was find Kaylie, make sure she's okay. Help Pike repair Vasselheim or literally whatever she wants to do. Give all money to Kaylie except for my platinum bracelets with sapphires worth 2,500 gold that I send anonymously to Sybil to make sure she's taken care of. Long term, I would like to use my Wish/Teleport to check on Kaylie every now and then, at school or wherever she ends up. I don't know but we'll wait until we get to Ashley to find out how things are going with our dating. Otherwise, in my free time, I would love to use my time to write down the epic stories of Vox Machina, from our meeting to saving the world and everything in between. It will be difficult as Scanlan is not an author, but he will rely on guidance from Ioun herself and may even ask Sprigg to be a copy-editor of sorts. The working title is "In the Belly of Dragons The Legend of Scanlan "Shorthalt and Vox Machina". Working title. And I hope to finish the book by the time I turn 71. Oh, I'd be 70. When we started, I was 69. Yeah. I mean, that's about it. I think every once in a while, I would maybe try to see if I could see Vax or check in on him somehow, but I don't know how other than to scry. I love it! No, I had written a letter, but yours is much better. Yeah, that's great. I didn't know how much Matt was going to put. I can read the end of the letter. No, it's fine. You did good. No, you did great. Much better. Should we roll for dating? (laughter) Like second-base well or even better than that? Absolutely. No, I think the most free I've ever been is with you. Sure. The weird family dynamic. Weird roommates. Giant lower floor, tiny upper floor. I mean, I would have to ask Wilhand for his permission. Well then, I would go leave some flowers at the grave. Oh, I will ask Grog for permission. Grog, as the father figure in our weird household, I would like to ask for your permission to wed your not-daughter, Pike, who is much smarter and older than you. I have this little black rock that you gave me. That's pretty good. I won't hurt her, I promise. Nope, I know you could kill me in my sleep. Would you walk me down the aisle and by walk me down the aisle, I mean carry me down the aisle? (laughter) All right, let's have a group weird hug. Do I have to convert, Pike? Do I have to convert? I'm an Iounian. Okay, I'm good. Multi-faith ceremony. There you go. Is he dead? Damn it. 8,000 gold. 8,000 gold. What a nice story. Thanks, Matt. That was really nice.
