I am ketchup. (laughter) Nope, this is it. Nine dollars. I gave you some gloves. Yeah, or Pac-man. I'm not sure. I think that was Jackie Mason.

Everything is there at your fingertips the source books, the digital character sheets, the homebrew content creation! Go to dndbeyond.com now to check out how easy they make playing D&D. Now, you guys all know that first and foremost, I am a filmmaker, and I am proud to announce that tonight I have teamed with D&D Beyond to create my first ever foray into stop-motion animation. I don't want to say it's better than The Nightmare Before Christmas, but I'll let you guys say that. Wait until you see it for yourself. Let's roll my film. Thank you. Any film like this is a collaborative process. I have so many people I want to thank. I'll try to keep it quick. Our cinematographer Giuseppe Fister, wonderful work, powerful work. Our gaffer Blumpkin Styles, the most daring in the biz. Our sound mixer Randy Cockburn, didn't think you could pull it off like that. Best boy Mike Litoris, I can't believe I found you. Our producer Willy Stroker, you've got a finger on the pulse, sir. Casting director Ima Dumas, and of course my agents at CAA, Amanda Hump, Keifer Comings, Dickson Beavers, Harry Sacks, Otto Beemakraken, Wilma Fingerdo, Irma Wanker, Drew P. Winer-- oh, I'm sorry, Drew P. Wiener, thank you all for believing in this project. Also, my inspiration, my mentor, Hugh Janus, Mr. Janus, wherever he is. I think Hugh Janus is smiling down on all of us tonight. And of course, D&D Beyond, we did it guys! It took three years, but we did it. Thank you. Yeah, it's been in post for months. It was really good, Matt. You did a great job. I watched it on the cab ride home from the airport. It was so good. Amazing. Yay! You were great, Marisha. Your wife shines. That's right. Oh god. Was any of that real? You do. You have three eyes. Worried you could maybe die? Oh, where'd you get this? It's a bird? Two eyes on this one? The Ki'Nau? Wow. That is vivid. Do they seem to be the same three on each, or is it just silhouettes? I'm going to go investigate-- not the hydra, the creature that I killed. I'll rifle around looking for any keys or objects. 25. I'll take the shield and hang on to it until I can give it someone who wants it. Like, pushing her? I have a few things that I'd like to talk about. Poop it out. Stone cold. Travis, you have your fate, too. That sounds good, yes. He likes water. He'll be fine. Come on! Let's get out of here. You don't have to drag me, I'm going! Come on, Fjord, let's get out of here! The water! Bad water! All water's bad, but this is even worse. I'm walking up. Oh, the orchard, that's right. Oh, so there's no stairs? Let's climb! Oh, shit! Oh, yes! Sure! It was one of these holes. I'm going to just pick one. I go to the north one. I don't know. I don't remember. I'm just going to go into one of-- Aren't these-- there's little holes, right? Do I remember which one was the-- Nine. Oh, plus six? No, this is not a saving throw. Plus three? So, 12. Okay. Do I see a little door, a little hole near where I'm standing? Natural 20. Locks me-- Fountain lowering? I will open it up again. Everybody out! I cast Mage Hand! Yeah, I'm going to climb up. Like to make the jump? Do you want to jump off of Yasha or anything? Give me a boost! I'm going to scurry up Mr. Clay and jump. I'm just going to just go (screaming) and start shooting at the first one. That's not great, it's a 14. 16 to hit. 16 to hit. That's fine. It causes nine hit points of damage. I would probably bonus action-- if I had a bonus action I would shoot again. 16 to hit again. Another 11 points of damage. If I'm on top of the water, how much space do I have? I'll roll for Jester. Terrible. Nine over here. Jester had a seven. D&D Beyond. And Tor Books everybody. Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books. LIAM and Nope. Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books. Except now it's filled with water. Ooh! How did you do that? (exclamations) You have throwing stars. Is she hitting the trapdoor? Got it. Root guards? Ah! Oh! Miss. Hit. Miss. (singing) Balls and ass. Ass, ass and balls. Who had I shot before? Can I do something unconventional here, Matt, and undo my last shot? So, give him back 11 points of damage. Because I'm holding a keg of gunpowder and there's no way I can reload a crossbow while holding a keg of gunpowder. All right. All right. All right. To the one who's on me, all up in my grill, I'm going to touch them and cast Shocking Grasp. Which is a-- Melee spell attack, so I roll at disadvantage. Nine plus six, 15. Okay, great. I've never done this before. Let's see here. I'm at 5th level, so it's 2d8. What's a d8? Hey, eight points of damage! A what? Does that work? Oh, boy! I hate water. I'm going to swim away, as fast as I can. I still have to disengage, right? I will bonus action disengage and swim around past Fjord. Yeah, around this way. Going towards the exits. With one hand. Jester would like to probably-- She will cast Toll the Dead. 15 wisdom. Five points of lost air. LIAM  I'm just going to remember that. Awesome. You are a tiny man. Check his body for gold! Snake temple key! It says it right here on the equipment list. Jester has it! Oh boy. Man, I really don't like this water. Oh boy, all right. I will doggy paddle towards the snake-hand man and hit him with another zap. Okay, my turn. Do I need to first make a constitution save? At the end of my turn, okay. I'll swim up and poke the thing with my shortsword. Oh boy. Okay. What does this thing do? 15! Oh? I do?! Oh wow. Okay. That's 21 points of damage. Because it can't see me, I'll go up and-- I don't use shortsword a lot, so I'll let it float for a second and grab it from behind and then rake it across the back of its neck. I'm going to go towards the door as much as I can. Not great. 12. That's my favorite condition is not drowning yet. (Jester voice) She's going to cast Mending. (laughter) Seven plus-- nine. No. Seven plus two equals nine. She rolled a nine. Next turn, you'll be dead. This will be no problem, right? Are you upside down right now? Oh, yes! I will grab Jester's horns and pull and go up as fast as I can. Bonus action dash. Sure, yeah. So it works. Money shot! I cast Feather Fall on everyone else. (cheering) I throw a wet feather. (laughter) We're about to hit the top of the temple, or all the sides of it? No, you're unconscious. As we're in the air, I'm going to take the shield that I stole off my back, and slide it under Caduceus' butt like a-- (laughter) It doesn't matter, you're out. Natural 20. 18 plus. Like a skydiving team? The water's still coming, right? Oh my god, the island is sinking. It's a turtle's back! It's the Cajun turtle! I feel like I'm behind you because I've got water walking on, so I'm like-- 23, and Jester rolled a 23. Jester's been trying to make her way towards him, if possible. Towards him, I don't know if she can get there. She rolled a 23. I mean she rolled a 19 plus four. She does, she's trying to touch you so she can cast Cure Wounds on you. (as Jester) I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on little man. (as Jester) You're always little to me. You're right. One point plus four is five. Is the water going the way we want to go? We need Caleb up front too, to guide us. Everyone has to have an offer? I have one thing, but-- We don't have eyes on the yuan-ti, do we? I would wait until they get closer before I do my thing. Maybe Jester can-- Well, I don't either, but if they do, I'd be ready for something. Well sure, so I'll just yell to Beau Beau! Repeat after me, Fluffernutter! I'm going to throw the keg of gunpowder behind us. Wait, is it on fire? It has to be on fire! General strength? That was my nickname in high school. 15. Then if I can, I would push it with a little Mage Hand, with a little extra top spin on it. So blow it up! We'll make a wall of fire! But the barrel you said was mostly intact? Yeah, but what about inside? Barrels are waterproof, you keep beer in them. I just turn Beau around like, (shouting) That was amazing! How did you do that with a throwing star? This thing won't stop! Ten. Jester rolled an eight. Okay, conditions. We're still doing this? We hear a hunting party? We see a hunting party? And set them off at the same-- Sure. Sure? Yes! Let's do it! You know, Jester hasn't done anything yet, she still has a Thaumaturgy she could do. "You can "cause harmless tremors in the ground," but it doesn't say where. Oh, "within 30 feet," yeah. That's no good. Yeah, they don't. Never mind, she uses it to alter the appearance of her eyes for one minute. (laughter) I'm going to put up the cloak and just sneak. We hear them? In a direction that we can identify? Okay, I'll just say, stay here, and I'm going to put up the hood and I'm going to dodge off in that direction stealthily. Do I have to roll for stealth, I assume? Okay, so that's 22. I'm going to cast Mage Hand. They're holding nets and what else? Okay, Jesus, I got nothing, man. I'm just going to try to Mage Hand and trip the guy in the back with his own net. Just pull it down a little. Arcana check? Okay, arcana check is a 20. Sure. Didn't know what else to do, but okay. Okay. I guess that's all I'll do. I don't know what else to do! I-- You know what, I'm going to-- Fuck it! I'm going to cast Message and tell Caleb, go! I'm going to go, hey fucktards, over here! and I'm going to just draw their attention. I'm going to bolt, double dash, fast as I can go away. Not back towards my friends but like-- Perpendicular. Nope. Drink run. Drink and run. I saw you guys through the woods, but they're behind me. Yeah. (whisper) Oh my god. One point of exhaustion, Jester succeeded, I rolled a 14. Damn. (panting) (panting) I'm exhausted. They're right behind me! Oh yes! Start the motor, start the motor! Oh my god. You're the one who-- it's your thing! Magical prime time. Do we really only have mutterfingers-- --blob boffers, and words? I want Meese's Meanutmutter Mubs! (laughter) I don't even know what that means. Can I pause you for one second, Matt? Did you all fucking take off your costumes? No! That I saw. (laughter) Yeah, yeah! Do I? Sticky butt. Peel off, peel off. Sorry, Matt. In a graveyard. Go to our quarters, I guess? Okay, that's good. (gnawing) What was Avantika's? She controlled the water? She's the one who made the flood? Oh, when we took off. I was curled up in the bottom of the well of the rowboat, cowering, so I didn't see any of that. She got something for giving up her--? We also heard a large cracking sound as if a lock had been broken or a wall had been broken. Are we pirates now? Is that the thing? Because I don't like the water at all. I don't want to be on a boat anymore. If I might, Fjord. I don't know much about how this magic works, but if there's three of these things, right, at least three of these eyes that need to be placed to unlock three temples of whatever and release the crazy thing under the ocean. One has been activated, one is inside you, there's one-- maybe we should try to find that one. With that one, we could then safely get the one out of you because we would have the third one and we could go break it somewhere and then we'd know that no one could unlock it ever. What if we surprise her, tie her up, then Jester can do her Zone of Truth thing. We can find out everything she knows, slit her throat, and sink her ship. What if we just leave her? She could go off and do god knows what. He can stay with her, we can stop it before she does it. She's just touching her lips. Wait. Take this vial of acid, just in case. I don't know. Maybe she'll try something and you just splash it in her face. I don't know. I don't know! Sure, whatever. Nope, just acid. I did. No not until he comes back from his rendezvous. I don't like it at all. It's terrible. This was the worst day of my life. I mean, as far as I can remember. This was a really bad day, and water had a lot to do with it. (laughter) Sure. Oh, I don't care about being underwater. I just don't like looking at it. Contested! (no audio) Just splash acid all over it! (laughter) (whispering) Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh man, I'm getting some Twitchwood right now. (laughter) The sound of fish slapping against each other. (laughter) Do we recover our exhaustion? I should probably roll for Laura. What do you think? You think she'll appreciate that? Nice! One. Eight! So I reroll a one? I feel like I should reroll this again. (sighing) It just feels cheap. Because I rolled a one first!
