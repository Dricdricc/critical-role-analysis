Sorry, sorry, sorry. Thanks! But I'm also wearing a tie because it's a special night. (sighs) So, is Allura dead? (laughter) You were dead. Mostly dead. You'll need that. You're, like, indestructible now! A pocket-plane? Something that we can summon? I'll take that. Once we release whatever is inside of it, we can use this necklace as a weapon, to-- To trap people. I just remember that Purvan's story touched me. Touched me in inappropriate ways. There's also magic resistance down there. Correct. Vasselheim? We're here. That would be too careful. Vex! Just open it! Plus they don't like magic. Aren't we going to sleep? It's four in the afternoon! (laughter) I'll come, too. Well, actually, wait. Grog, what're you doing? I'm with Grog. We brought some Council members, right? Were any among our-- Oh, that's right, I'm sorry, oh, I'm not there! (laughter) I don't know. I hadn't really thought about it. Do you have any games with you? Anything in the Bag of Holding? Doesn't sound very fun. Should I play a song so no one can hear it? Yeah, yeah. A little muzak. It's what I'm here for. Nothing to see here, everybody! (plays random chords on the harmonica) Nothing to see here! Sounds like a rough one in there, buddy! Ah, yup, that's tacos! No problem! Grog, are you talking to your shit? Okay. No one's out here, Grog. Just me. Are you all right? I heard you say something about blood. At some point you said, "Are you full?" Are you talking about-- did you fill it all the way up? Wow! You topped it off! Not at all. I think I'm good. I love a good deuce, but not today, I think. We should go get a bite. (laughs) All right, let's go. Can I buy a torch somewhere? Just a torch? Three. And wherever we're eating, does it happen to be near Jameson the painter's workshop? Be nice to check in with him. Grog, do you mind walking with me? All right, so we'll truck on over to Jameson's. Yes! Hi! I've come back. The town, you mean. It was wise of you to keep this precious artifact here, because it would've surely been destroyed en route or when it arrived-- I'm sure it's huge. Did you finish it? Can I look? (laughing) Okay, let's go look! How's the face? How's the face? Yes! (laughter) I'm going to request-- Grog, I need a minute here. Just to weep. So I regard it for a few minutes, taking in the beauty and the wonder of all I've accomplished-- After I weep for a few minutes, I thank Jameson again and how much did I pay him for this thing? You've gone above and beyond, Jameson, and I know that you're a humble man and you don't want me to spread word of your accomplishments, but please allow me to write you an epic poem or a song and tell of your artistic gifts and talents, please. I'll get right on it. Don't worry, you'll have lots of commissions after this, I promise you. And I'm going to give him an extra 50 gold. For art supplies to get your shop up and running. So, can it be-- Grog! Grog! Can you hold this for me? No, I can't do it. Grog! I watched you shit for an hour! It's too close! Should we go out in the woods and unleash an undead beast that will kill us all? I do. Don't worry, it's safe. Oh! Hold on-- Got a pouch or some-- you know what? It's back in my room. Got it! Mm, that's possibly more important. I think this thing'll be fine! I can heal! Yeah, where're we headed? The caves would contain it. It can't fly away or anything. All right, fine, fortress. All right, well, I'm just going to do it then! LAURA and A wall for what? All right, in three, two-- On the one. On one. Should one of us leave the room in case it comes out and paralyzes all of us? Just going to throw that out there. It can see me. Well, when a thing is born, it latches on to the first thing it sees, like its mama. Here we go, guys. I don't know how to use this thing. By the power of Raven's Slumber, I command thee (yells) awaken! Beast! Cruel or otherwise! Face your new master, and know his name is Scanlan! (laughter) Easy, easy. Garlic? Galdric, Galdric, easy, Galdric. Easy. We're friends. Here. Is it a small beast? I can only speak with small beasts. Animal handling! We've never done that before! Aren't you getting dressed? Seven-and-a-half minutes! (laughter) There are several items that are sold out at the store! If you'd like to go on and see what items have already sold out, check it out. (laughs) Yeah, we know that. We know that, guys. We know. Is there a ring or something? I don't know. Is he Donald-Duck-ing it right now? Nice. Where who is? Going to stop him, Grog? Dog whisperer! Are you its master now? Yeah. Wolves love getting drunk. We should keep some food on hand next time! So are we telling this wolf something or commanding it to come with us as we return to town? Let's go back to town and bring him with us. Do you want to trade with me, Vax? I've got some armor you could take. We should find some food for the thing, too. Do it. I don't know. Finalize this wolf so we can go kill something. She's the alpha. It's a command. I thought she did very well. The thing that can capture evil. Not only does it not hurt him, he does not age or feel any pain. You should probably say something cool. Hey, and if Trinket isn't in it, you can also use it to capture baddies. Where are we going next? What's our to-do list? Wait, wait, wait. What are the things that we need to do? Cobalt Reserve, Ashari. Did we already take care of Osysa's mate, Frostweald? We need to steal an airship. What about, we need to find Kaylie at some point. We also need to, who's gone, where's Allu-- where's Ki-- where's people? If we're going to go, do we need anything before we leave? We got everything we need? Potions and stuff? Want to buy some meat for your cooler? How much, could I buy a medical kit somewhere? How much is that? All right, whatever, I've got it. Can that stabilize people? Do I wear robes? No thanks. Missile snaring? What does that do? I think I can take it? Eh. What's our mission? Before we set off on this, is there anything closer or more pressing? I don't actually know why we're going to her place, but I'm fine with it. All right, let's knock it off. We've got to get out of here. How about the wolf? Keyleth, could you-- Could you make me some tea real quick? What? What, you were up before me, I thought-- Why don't you sleep during the day, we'll all take our feast, and then blast off at night time? She's with Gilmore. Advantage on wisdom. Okay. Oi. Hey, friendo. What's up? Well, we start to and then you leave the room, usually. (laughter) It's okay. I walk away. (laughter) Then I come back, I feel bad. Just kidding, just kidding. I'm already as low as I can go. How do I do what? Well, Vax. I don't know, I mean, I like you people, okay? Everything before this was not as good. This is better. That's why. It's very simple. You had a shitty childhood, didn't you? You and the sister? I think Grog had some troubles. We've all had our share of shit before we all met. Now we're together, we're a family, this is better. That's how I smile. It's better than it was before. That's it. Yes, but it's fun while it lasts. Glean some wisdom? Listen, I'm older than you. A bit. I've seen more than you have. And it's all shitty, so it just depends on how you look at it. You can dwell on the shit, or you can just leave it behind in people's beds and keep going. I walk away. How far? You could. It has a chain and a string now. Pass Without a Trace is--? 25. What's that? Is that her? You guys are texting? Why don't we go over there and talk to them? Oh, shit. Five. Not saving. Yeah. You can carry me. How can we be of assistance? Hit me, babe. No, I'm fine, don't worry about me. Yeah, that's not great.
