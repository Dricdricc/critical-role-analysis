D&D Beyond, everybody. It's almost Thanksgiving time and I thought, what better for us to do than to thank our long-time sponsor D&D Beyond. They've been with us all campaign, we hope into the next year, so as a token of our appreciation, we put together a highlight reel of all my best moments from all the best D&D Beyond ads of the year, so roll that clip, gentlemen, and we're going to-- Hold on. I've just been handed something. Okay. I'm being told that we don't have that clip, which is disappointing because we had meetings about this all week, I talked to editors about this, and this was important to me, and to-- Okay, sorry. Okay, I'm being told that we did not have meetings all week about this, and this is a bit that I wrote about an hour ago. Needless to say, I feel like D&D Beyond is going to not like this because we've taken them on this rollercoaster of emotions now, and they're going to be pretty pissed off, they may pull their sponsorship dollars-- Okay, now I'm being told that no, they will not pull their sponsorship dollars because they really just want me to read the ad copy that they provided me two days ago. So I'll just read that now, and they'll be happy. As a reminder from last week, Dungeon of the Mad Mage and the Magic The Gathering D&D crossover, Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica, are available now in the D&D Beyond marketplace. Be sure to pick up yours at dndbeyond.com/marketplace. Okay, fine, so maybe they're a great company, but I feel like they're going to resent me for-- I am being told that no, they're not going to resent me at all, and in fact they have a promo code named after me. The promo code is "SamIsOurHero"-- not case sensitive-- it can be used right now for 25% off all digital books, including those two books I just mentioned earlier, so go to the store right now and use it. Okay, forget about D&D Beyond, all right? The fans will be pissed off at me, right? They will think that I'm an awful human being, they'll drag my name on Reddit-- I'm being told now that there's nothing written on any of these pieces of paper, and this is just a thinly-veiled attempt to get attention to myself because I am very insecure, I have these deep-seated problems, and-- I'm being told now that I'm actually pretty happy, and I don't have any deep-seated depression or anything like that, and I'm a pretty good guy. Wow, I really think, guys, that this bit has been a journey for all of us, and I feel like we've all learned something about ourselves, and about-- Nope, I'm being told we have not learned anything, and that I'm to wrap it up, so back to you, Matt! That sounds awesome! That's tomorrow. Is it all honey plus Brian Foster, or just all honeys? Awesome. Ooh! I've heard of them. Oh that's right, I have to do a fireside chat. Okay. Uh-huh. Oh, maybe I can just wear that. That's a good idea. Water. Yeah. (whispers) Shoot her in the back of the head. Oh! I saw it. Tithe? (singing) Everyone's fucking Avantika! Oh yes, he did have a weird hairline, right? Maybe that's in fashion here, maybe we should all go wig shopping. Just saying. Mm-hmm. The Bloated Cup. Yeah, we're new pirates. Are you a pirate? I mean, I guess we're all pirates, right? Everyone's a pirate here? Oh! Are you a captain, or do you do something else that's more specialized? A sniper? Name check! Quick, Phillip, which way's north? That's amazing! You can spin him. Here! I'm going to spin him around a couple times. Now which way's north? Wow, right? Don't fight each other! Because that's crazy. Why? Why would you do this? Inelegant, but perfect. Crikey. I'll take that bet! Who? Did you say Mario? We're awwing. Yes, you did. Good job, Jester! Ooh! I'm going to go steal from them. Oh, wait, no, you can't do that on this island. It is the Traveler. He's going to use that a lot? That phrase? Did he drink a lot? Into the water? Do cannon-folk typically go on those trips, or do cannon-folk typically stay behind with the ship? Gunner master. Oh. How can you promise that? Friend of yours, or former friend? What purse? Oh, but not like a cute little-- I knew someone like that once. They would always go fishing and say that they caught something, but they never did. Yes. Ooh, we'll put our weights down to weigh it down. There's a cube. (record scratching) Remix! With the missus? Oh. The lady-- (frustrated noise) Bon soir. In Halfling I will say to Beauregard Hey, don't you think we should go talk to that Allison person? Can I tag along? She asks in Halfling. There's no streets, it's all alleys. Vague directions. Sure. I love a good powder. Where's the bathroom? We just walked across the whole place. I haven't seen the bathroom once. Oh? We're just going to take a shit in the alley? Is it Alice or Allison? Maybe that's why she didn't listen to you. Because you called her the wrong name. If she comes out here, what are we going to say to her? But she's going to ask who we are. What do we tell her? That we're disgruntled members of her crew? But she can turn us in! That's terrible. We should say that we're-- I'm not good at that. Okay. Yeah, you're right. You're very charismatic. We're going to be fine. No! It seems that way because I'm making a face because I'm halfway through a dump right now. I'm ready. You're welcome, Gary Gygax. Okay. Do you think we should go back in? All right, I guess we'll go back inside, then? Sure. Do your business. What-- What do you think of our pirate vessel so far, of our pirate mission? Are you having fun? Nothing, we can go back in-- Yeah, let's go for a walk. They can go back to the boat, right? Do you know how deep it is to the bottom there? Is it deep, deep ocean, or just medium-ocean? All right. It's fine. Let's go explore! Sort of like a golf club cover? The sea breeze. At night, it's a land-breeze. Is anyone on the streets? Okay, if we're going to talk about these things, let's use some code words. Don't say her name, say a different name. Yes, Tiffany. The name of the ship. Tiffany's ship. Tiffany's Ship is the name of Tiffany's ship. That's all the code we need, all right. The Apricot. Anything else before we get into this? All right, so, how will we deal with Tiffany? Of course we're walking-and-talking. Everyone do this. She went to bed, she's fine. She won't know we're talking about her because we're using a new name, Tiffany, so she's not even going to know. We love you, Orlando. If I may? Here's our options. I don't, but I've been thinking about things. I'm lit. I'm tight, but feeling good. Our intent is to get off this island without Tiffany, correct? Apricot? Fruit stand? Apricot tree. Here's our options. I'm just putting them out there. I put no weight on any of them. We can follow Tiffany tomorrow as she goes about her day. We can get in touch with this Allison person, follow her-- I know, right? (laughter) We could talk to some of Tiffany's crew, right? Bouldergut seems dumb. Sorry. Franklin Delano Roosevelt seems dumb. (laughter) Then, there's this Sorris fellow. I don't know, he didn't seem like he's be a font of any knowledge. We can sabotage Tiffany's ship. I don't know what that would do because we need it to get off the island. We could frame Tiffany for some crime against another pirate! We have a signature from Tiffany in a letter that she wrote. We have-- that is all that we have. What? You could pop in where? To her ship? To her captain's quarters? On the ship? On the Tiffany ship? That's a lot. You can just leave. But it's our ship, we work on the ship. You mean like plant something? Rifle through her stuff. That would be permanent. Wait, if you could get in to her cabin, you can Disguise Self as well, right? You could change yourself to Vera or something? Or to Avantika or Vera? Oh shit! Shit! You could turn yourself into Franklin Delano Roosevelt. You could walk off the ship and no one would think the wiser, or they might say, "Franklin Delano Roosevelt! Why are you on "Tiffany's ship?" You'd be like, "Bitch, I work here." I'm Franklin Delano Roosevelt! Honda. Can you keep Tiffany busy for, you know, 15 or 20 minutes? 25 if you really had to? Take a break? This is a good plan, and we're going to go in there-- oh, you're going to go in there. Do you need some help? Except Beau can't make herself look like anything else. Fake Tiffany. I can break into things. I can also talk to Caleb. I can make myself look like something. I could be Ipess. It cannot fail! This is the best plan we've ever had. We need someone just off the boat in case things go awry. I'll message you that we need some help on the inside, and there needs to be someone on the outside of Honda and Tiffany in case he needs some help in there, I don't know. Where were we meant to stay? Where are the other crew staying? On the ship or on land? Sure. You're the runner. Sure. Honda, are you going to be able to-- I'm just saying, there's gonna be a peeping tom in the room with you. I think we need Frumpkin in there. A peeping tomcat. No, he can fly outside the window and peek in, just to see if you're-- What's the source of the thunder? Is that like-- It looks open? Getting on is not a problem. Inside the ship. We can just be there. No. We just are in. What do you mean? Please, start over again. Uh-huh. We're going to start the bamf there. You won't see us ever. I mean, I have very high dexterity. Okay. Maybe charisma? Leaving. I can already dex my way around. But you can't. Are you dextrous? I have Feather Fall. Maybe? Yes, I want it! Give it to me now! Ooh, did anyone touch the dodecahedron yet? Fjord, do you want to do it? I guess you're already fucking. Do you want the dodeca? (screaming) Fate point. You've stolen from a lot of rich people. I know, it's sort of her defining trait. When you laugh right after you said that, I think that was very insulting. (laughter) No, she was laughing. We're ready. Let's do this. How does this work? Well, is there a chance it could fail? Might we die? Are we synchronizing watches? What is this? What? Ah! That was amazing! We are secret agents! We're secret detectives! Yes. Oh, wait, I've already forgotten! Take out the wire, fold it just so. Okay. We're in the ship, Caleb. 120 feet. Can you hear me? Reply to this message. 120 feet. Beauregard, can you hear me? If you can, respond to this message. We are inside the boat. Relay that message when you can. Bye. Do you want to burn them for light? Oh, okay. That's better. Just close the windows. Hood up. 18. There's probably gap under the doorway, a gap under there. They'll see a glowing light. I would reveal my unmentionables! I'll take my cloak and hang it over the curtains so it's double-blocked. You're going through papers, yeah? I'm going to go around the walls and look for hidden safes. We get advantage on everything. 19. Hidden safes in the wall, trap-opening thingies. I'll check it for traps. Investigation? Three. 12. Well, it's still pretty low. 12. Okay. I will pick up the book. We've been made! Turn over the place. Hold your breath. Not yet, no! Hold your breath, we've got to look around! I'm still looking, I'm holding my breath and I'm looking. You paint, I'm looking. I look at the book, is there anything there? Common, Goblin, Halfling. Taking the book. I'm going to go over to the desk where Jester had pointed and start jimmying the lock on the locked thing. 15. Pull it open. (grunt) And just smoke! Sure. Taking them all. We've got to look more! Okay, get in the-- I'm going to grab a cloak off the thing. Now there's a permanent hole there. Modifiers? Two. I'm going to very quietly say Wait until you hear a body fall above us. (whispering) Okay. (normal volume) What did I steal? Can I open one up and see what's in it? Put the jewel right on his shoulder. Yeah, I tuck it under the blanket, like it was with him. Yeah, I'm going to keep the rest for myself. We're going to crawl under his bed. 23 plus ten, still? 33, I guess. Right? We can go back up, we can keep looking! Lift me up! I think it's probably wafted out by now. Down the hall? Peek my head up. That's a natural one. Maybe I should reroll that one, I'll do my fate die. Okay, that's slightly better nine. (laughter) Tap her head Down! Wow! I'm going to say Down! Wisdom now. 11. It's a condition. 19. I don't know. I don't know what just happened. This is a crazy ship. I don't know. Let's call for help. Caleb, can you hear me? We're in big trouble. We need help! We need a distraction. Is Caleb there yet? Great. Going to try it again. Beauregard, we're going to need a distraction to get out of here! Mild confusion and panic, but don't-- what? We're going to disguise ourselves? Hold on, I'll call you back. You were going to be Avantika and I was going to be Ipess. It doesn't make any sense right now, does it? I guess she will have seen one hole by now. Are there any portal windows? I'm going to grab that jewel that was on the floor. Wait, wait! Just paint wood there! Fuck. No, no, no. Sure. How's her painting going? They're going to find a hole. Two gems. One gem. I'll break it in two. 19. Leave that. We're going to cast Disguise Self on each other. I'm going to be Keg. Great. Pirate Keg, Pirate Molly. Up on deck though, and see if anyone's around. Perception or-- what are we? 19. (loading bow) No? SAM and How far up? I'm going to cast Phantasmal Force on that person, on that being. Intelligence, 14. Describe the crow's nest to me? All right, I will make the figure think that his crow's nest has caught fire, and there are little flames licking around, creeping up the sides of it, and surrounding it. Off the back of the boat. Yeah, we're stealthing. No, we're stealthing. We're moving from-- Okay. 36. The seaward side. Yes. The side away from the docks. Jump in! We're jumping in. Baby seal style. Swim away. I'll hold your hand as I walk away on the water. I'm lying great. Just away and around. I won't ever let go! Oh god! I'm letting go! 38. (relieved groaning) I'm probably a bit wet too. Yeah, I'm wet. Nope. I mean, just calmly walking away, right? Are there lots more people coming? No, you look great. You look great. Do I look okay? Light my cigarette. You've got a cloak on. Disguise Self? Or-- Oh. The Phantasmal Force? Let's get the fuck out of here, right? We're just going to calmly walk into town? I don't know. Good evening, madam. Dripping wet. And dry off. Are we still soaking wet? Like a dog, I'll shake it off a little bit. Do you have any spells that can make us dry? Oh no, your weasel's dead again, isn't it? What's that? What does that do? Are you saying to me that we made a mistake? I agree! We got a book! We got some jewels. These are hot ice! We got to get rid of these. I know. Don't worry. We're going to plant them on Allison. Everything's going to be fine, don't worry. Figured. Done. Mage Hand. Allison's pocket. We're clean. Hey, you did good in there. Yeah, we're pretty great. Who are you talking to? Don't worry. There was a little hiccup. But we took care of it. Hey, just throwing it out there, there seemed to be a couple of loose ends that we need to tie up. Can you make us an alibi? Like, suggest to someone that we were drinking with them all night, in case it's asked? Oh, well then don't do that. Never mind. I assume a lot of people down there. The best. Don't accidentally turn it to fungus. Sure has. I'll do the same. Good stuff. We got a book. Well, I don't have it. Can any of you read this? It was hidden behind a panel, like a false panel in the wall. Oh, nice! There's these jewels, too. Then we caused another guard to stab someone, and another guard to jump to his death. But we can turn this problem into a "proble-tunity", and we can take these jewels that she will definitely know came from her, and plant them on someone else to just sort of-- we could plant them on this Allison person who she doesn't like already! Or maybe on one of her own crew, and have them killed. Oh. We could plant them on someone that we don't like? How about Jamedi Cosko? I don't like that guy. We don't want to hold on-- Yeah, these are hot rocks here. We could destroy these gems and smash them up into smaller gems. Vera? Why do you think Vera? Isn't that just because you stole her job? That seems like a legitimate beef. How do you know that? She said she's going to kill him?! Well then we should roast her. That could be good stuff. There's three land masses, right there! Which one's her favorite? And I fucked him. I don't want to say that we're the best detectives because that's already-- -- established fact. But could this be that we just got promoted? Commissioner. I don't know. Could be. We just cracked the case again. Don't bother him! Wow. Best plan ever. It's pretty! Oh, but wait. It's a hot rock. We could put it in the bag of holding or whatever. Do we know where she's staying, which room she's in? What, the jewels? We can just throw them in the ocean. We could snoop-- We could wait until we see Vera at breakfast tomorrow and just-- Right? She's staying here. Except if we bring this to the Plank King, it's admitting that we broke into the ship and stole it. We do. We still need proof that this came from her, that she wrote this. But that's fake. Yeah. That's good, I like that. She would've shared that, right? What!? We could drop it in Allison's mailbox and say, hey, here's all the proof you need to destroy Avantika. Well, did you see the way they looked at each other? Yeah, he was asking for a snitch. That seems legit. That seems legit and honest. He was making an honest-- Right? Did you get the honest vibe from Plankie? Ooh, who knows what it'll be. She's keeping us in suspense. Then we can take her boat. But then we'll face her head on. Just one-- One other consideration. One other consideration, just throwing it out there. We're all spitballing here, right? You know that page that you were telling us about that says, the three land masses might be the Grand Archipelago? Maybe, when you're translating, that becomes four land masses and a different place? We're going to translate one page? No, it's got to be the whole book. I would Mend the page that has the thing about where the peach tree is. We are so good at this! Where does that go? Are we all staying in this room tonight? Well, we've got the silver thread up. She can't get in. I attack Fjord, sneak attack damage! Pretty good. (knocking) Oh. What's Caleb up to? Hide that shit, hide that shit! Hide that shit! It's in the haversack. It's okay. She can't pull the safe unless she knows it's in there. Hello? On the deck of the ship? All right. Aye aye. We'll see you there in, what, a couple hours? That's fine. Want me to throw it on the roof? He needs to change. We've got ten minutes. What about the jewels? Should we get rid of the jewels? We'll do it on the way. Well yeah, they're not in the room. Do you want to pop out of the room? Oh that. The haversack? Well what are we doing with the book and stuff? Do you want me to sleight of hand throw the bag down an alley as we walk? Sure. Got to get rid of it. We've gotta get rid of it! I'm super fast. Just toss it, and then we'll come back for it. Behind a dumpster. Look, it's a space shuttle. Where's the book right now? Yeah. We've got to get this book off the fucking boat! It's worth its weight in salt? Flawless plan, executed flawlessly. (singing) It can only be better.
