As I said last week, the Waterdeep Dragon Heist is now available on D&D Beyond. As Max said last week. They'll guide your Waterdeep campaign from levels one to five. After that, explore the legendary Undermountain Dungeon below the city with Waterdeep Dungeon of the Mad Mage for levels five through 20! Waterdeep Dungeon of the Mad Mage is available for pre-order on D&D Beyond and will release November 2nd. Now, because D&D Beyond is such a generous sponsor of this show, Laura, I wanted to show the audience some of what we do with that sponsorship money. We take it and we turn it into this amazing studio which has amazing equipment and after effects and editing suites and cool special effects, so we put together a really cool ad for them using all the equipment, and if you guys would turn to the monitor and see what we made. Hi, guys! As you know, we love D&D Beyond. It's easy to use, the interface is super high tech. Since their sponsorship helps us make this show, we thought we'd use all the cutting edge editing software in our fabulous new studio to make D&D Beyond a mind-blowing special effects ad. (explosions) Explosions, I assume. For instance, look at my face. Looks normal now, right? But when we add high tech CGI effects Oh, I look like a beholder! Roar! Antimagic cone! D&D Beyond! Okay, reset. Now, check out this awesome face swapping feature. Okay, right now, I look like Sam Riegel. But now (whoop). Oh, I'm Matt Mercer. Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors get to look at how handsome I am. Oh, now I'm doing a Cajun accent. Okay, reset. But that's not all. Now, it looks like I'm holding nothing, right? But now, with special effects. (gasp) Oh! I've got an adorable blink dog in my hands. Aw, isn't Nugget so cute? And reset. Wow, that was just a taste of the amazing special effects that D&D Beyond sponsorship covers here at the studio. Thanks, D&D Beyond, and if you don't mind, Scotty, beam me up! I'm probably gone by now, right? That was great! Thanks, Max. I can't wait to see how it cuts together. I can't wait to see all the effects. It's pretty lame, and also kind of insulting to Matt. I mean, if you want to be honest about it. Sorry to the audience, and sorry to D&D Beyond. Back to you, Matt! Guys, for D&D Beyond, I brought a loaded gun! Guys, it's really amazing! Yes, the charity that I'm very fond of, Pablove Foundation, they battle childhood cancer. What am I supposed to talk about tonight? I'm supposed to talk about the fact that because you guys raised so much money, we're doing a one-shot tomorrow night on the Critical Role Twitch channel. We're going to do a Crash Pandas one-shot with me as the Game Master and people like Laura Bailey, Liam O'Brien, Marisha Ray, Travis Willingham-- -- Matt Mercer. Basically everyone at this table except for Taliesin will be there. Tune in tomorrow night at 700 to see the show. We will also be giving away prizes to some lucky person who made a donation and tagged Critical Role in the donation field. That's it! Yay! Refresh! Yay sponsors! Yeah, someone will add some effects at some point. Ask him to put it back on! Guys need any help? It's probably not on land, yeah. Good job, Mr. Clay. What do you mean? Just tell him don't tell anyone or we'll come back and kill you. We need to have a conversation with him afterwards. We can tell him to leave the city and never come back or we'll take off your other hand! Did he see you, does he know who you are? Then why would connect anything to his mother? Unless we tell him. To your mother, I mean. It's a hotel that lots of Tracys I think probably stay at. Why don't you step aside, so that he doesn't see your face when he wakes up, or disguise your face so he hasn't-- Okay, so we got two kills, four maybes. Wait, is Yasha going with Adella? No. She's on a different boat, maybe. No, I know but she's going to be leaving at some point soon, right? We can always kill him. Maybe best case scenario, yes. So exactly the same as the guy, except long hair. I don't. Thanks Mr. Clay and Jester. Has it been 24 hours yet? I'm going to rifle through all of his pockets with lightning speed agility of hand. Mm, not good. 12. Great. All right, I'll take the gold and the bolts, and everything else I'll throw in a puddle. Does he have any pretty buttons, Matthew? I will pluck the buttons. Do I have to roll for each one? I'm going to start backing up, shaking my head. You people are fucked up! Must have a bag or something. Yeah, we can wrap him up in a cloak and carry him out like we're carrying some equipment. He doesn't, sometimes. Caleb, did you find anything? He'll never play piano. Maybe Beau and myself could go? How do you normally sign letters? Are you a "Sincerely" person, or a "Love," "Love, Algar?" Well, all right. I'm sure it's probably a "Sincerely." Sure, tortle. I don't know anything about the outside world. Where's far? I heard a traveler talking about Whitestone. I don't know, I just heard about it. I don't know anything about it. That's where Adella's going. I may have taken the money that was on him. Sure. Here you go, Jorge. Here's one platinum. And five copper. (laughter) We're going to try and take him to Adella or just any boat? "I'm going to burn all of my fellow guards with a large Fireball first." (laughter) They're going find some charred bodies and stuff-- How'd that fire happen, though? Wait. Turn Undead really just turns an undead around? Me and Marisha are took Jorge to the docks with the promise that Fjord would come later and join us. I mean, I don't know if I'm really here right now, so. Okay, that sounds good. Do you want to look at the dodecahedron first? Before you write this letter, let's time jump again. Before you write the letter-- The dicks look like his dicks. Should you put it on the door with like a dagger? With his-- I left his dagger. Shit. I could go back down the hall and get it? I have extra daggers, do you want a dagger? I have three extra daggers. Yeah! Through the paper. We already left. We're taking Jorge to the docks, right? Did we go to the docks? Great! Now where are we? On the docks? What do we do with Jorge? I'm kidding! (laughter) We could go back to Jester's mom and report. We could go to that tower and investigate it. We could. Oh, to meet Marius? Do we go towards the Lavish Chateau? Yeah! We'll be fine. You boys just wanted to come look at the tower again because you like it? There's no windows. It's pretty freaky. Hey, Caleb! You memorized the map of the underground pathways, right? Do any of them run under this tower? Using your spatial, Beautiful Mind techniques. Mm-hmm. Are we just here to see your mom? How do we get upstairs with you all tortley? All right. Let's go upstairs. Oh! This is Yasha. Has she met Yasha? Jester, why did you lie to your mom? We're whispering, she can't hear us. Why would she get in trouble? We did it. What if she finds out you lied to her and judges you for that? You should never lie to your mother. All right. You didn't do anything. No, this is very good. You had a friend that swallowed a stone? Do you want to borrow my mask? What mask? Yeah, that's good dinner wear. Oh boy, there goes your finger. What happens if we have to leave and the bird is still here? And a weasel? Lift off your mask. You got rid of a dog, that's great! Yeah, but we don't have to have him anymore, so that's good, right? All right. The weasel and the owl? I know, I want to eat that weasel so bad! Yeah. Is it almost midnight? Let's go. Whoa! He likes cursing, I guess. No, it's fine. It'll be great. He'll be fine, he can see in the dark. You know. The docks. We were told maybe one of those? I put up my hood as well. Should I go dart after him? Ah! What does that do? Okay, great. Seeing as there's no guard, I'm going to dart over towards where he's hiding, but not right on him or anything, across the way. Ooh, that's a one. That's slightly better. Stealth? 17. Mm-hmm. Okay. Perception check. Nine. Yes. (nervous chuckle) Great. Well, I'm ready. For anything. Yeah. Oh. I will trail behind. The layout of the dock, is the front of the ship near the dock? Is it pulled up? Is it parallel parked? SEAL team. That's your autobiography title! Night dolphins! While this is all going on, I'm going to cast Message and send it to Caleb and say There's something in the water! There's some argument happening. Something's going horribly wrong, Caleb. We should get out of here! You can respond to this message. I love that she was having a fight with her boyfriend with a giant owl on her shoulder. For what? I feel like it's a misty night. It feels like a misty night, don't you think? That was the first idea. Oh, man, this is so cool. Ooh, look at me, well-positioned. Initiative! Roll for initiative! I'd better roll for Laura. Classic Ashley. 16 here as well. Jester has 13. This is Sparta! We'll just make her last. Yeah, we said we were going to do that during the break. Isn't Summer's Eve a douche? Is he the redhead there? Oh boy. Secret service? Take it away. I mean... this big guy? I mean, I can certainly try. I don't want people to see me, but sure. You do your thing first. You just do your thing first and I'll see where the chips fall. Also, Matt, which guy is our guy? The red? LIAM  The red. Ooh, boy. I'm going to look up above me and-- wait, he doesn't see me yet, I think? Okay, so I'm going to scuttle away from him across to that other box over there, across the dock there. And, as I'm running, I'll turn around and fire once at the big guy. Still sneak attack because Marisha's engaged, right? That is a 24 to hit! Yeah! (counting) 21 points of damage! Then I will, bonus action, jump in that box-- (laughter) Ooh. Oh, wait, that's better than I thought. It's 19. I'm wearing my thing, my hood. Do I get to roll again for stealth? Still 19. Yes, you double-advantaged me. The Enforcer! Burn it all? Ooh, they're carrying weed. (laughter) Ooh! (singing) Para. Para. Paralyzed. Food fight! (laughter) 5d8 fruit damage?! Wow. Wizards. Why do we have to run? Seems like we're winning. They're burning marijuana. There's like nine of us. You can do that? So many steps. Misty, hidden, thunder. Oh no! Yeah! Become pirates. Nice. Smart kids. I guess? I'm hiding still, so I'm going to pop up and shoot the guy next to Marius. That is a lot. 20-something. 24 to hit. Again. Same roll. Is it sneak attack? Yeah. 20 points of damage. Bonus action. I'll shoot him again. Not as good. 17 to hit. Yeah. Eight more points of damage. Oh no, I shot the wrong guy! I'll run towards Marius, but stop around that box. That's it. Beau! (yelling) Oh no, you killed her! (laughter) We're friends! (choking) It's a pretty harsh grapple. We're here to save you! Oh god! Block his arrow for me! (like Laura) Yeah. Eeyore casts it. (as Eeyore) You know, anyone who tries to kill her can. (as Eeyore) We're all going to die in the end. We're killing everyone on the boat. We don't even know who they are! To get the people, yeah, you've got to get the boat. Don't worry, Sabian is hanging out below decks. All the human cargo is dead. No, the slaves that were below deck. Something's going well for Matt. The ship's on fire. No problem, we got this. Why don't we say that? Thought about that. We've got two bowmen. Who's the guy in black over there? The Enforcer who came up? I'll-- shit, I want to use my sneak attack. I will bonus action hide and then, from my hidden position, I will shoot. The guy in black over there. Oh, nice. That's a 23. That was a good roll. 23 points of damage. I will use any movement to emerge from my hidden position and move up a bit, to behind those barrels, maybe, so I have a little cover. You got to wear boat shoes! They've been burned badly. Maybe? Where are you? We're going to have to fucking wait ten minutes-- Flash! Aah! No one on the boat does. Oh, no. Oh no! Which we are. (laughter) Sail! We're off! (unsuccessful noise) No problem. So we can't launch. We've got five or six guards coming at us. Wow. I mean, I've got to get on that boat, right? Are there any more moorings or-- did she get off-- But the gangplank is holding us on? It's just resting there, so if we get moving, it'll just fall. Okay. I'll dash across the gangplank to get on the boat and-- jesus, how do we get rid of these guys? (laughter) Bonus action hide! Great. That's the illusory captain that I just made appear at the end of the dock. Wow, what do you see down there? Remember how, Jester, you couldn't come back to this town? Well now we all can't. You're never going to see your mom again. Sorry. We were just going to have a conversation with them. I'm hiding as well. (whispers) Oh no. What if Marius dies? And that was the last time we ever saw Caduceus. (laughter) Now we've just got to wait for the wind, guys. (laughter) To us, or everybody? I will roll. Terrible. Both were threes. Yeah, yeah! Tie that there! Do the winch! I hate water! (laughter) Is anything constraining our movement? Is the gangplank in our way? Or are we unfettered at this point? We're starting to drift a little? Okay. Then I will run up and tackle Marius to the ground and wrestle him down. Get over here, you fucking-- Get-- Come on! Get down! We're trying to talk to you! Ooh, wow. Athletics. Oh, that's just a straight 18. Okay. That's all I got. This is your, like, favored terrain and stuff. It's a boat. We're going to lose the sailor. (laughter) We're saving the world, Marisha, we're saving the world. We're doing great, guys! We've killed everybody, we're charming people, we're on a boat. Is Frumpkin an octopus and is it lying back on the dock somewhere? Oh, okay. What are the odds? In himself? And in us? No, he can choose another target on Sanctuary. Wow. In the water? I'm already on him. The old plank shove. Stay down! Stay down! I will spend my action seeing if there's any rope lying around, and trying to tie the man's hands up. I will keep him and I will Mage Hand grab some rope and bring it over to me, but then that will be my action. Then bonus action, I will use Mage Hand to start looping it around him. Ten. Oh, wait. No, it's just a seven. That's bad. He's just doing it. She commits suicide in front of him? What is happening? I'm probably focusing on Marius? So no. I'm not. He's never seen the ocean before. (laughter) Do you even have dark vision? MATT and You're swimming out into the dark? (laughter) Oh my god! That's right. There's an old man swimming in the ocean. Oh lord! (laughter) Don't worry. It's not what we came for. Keep going! Yeah, I just need some help tying this fucker up. I bring him up to Fjord. Does the drawer have fruit in it, though? We did it, guys. Mission accomplished. (pigeon coo) Don't kill him. I don't know. Wait, there's more below? He dead. We know his name. The Slavain Islands? We don't know what we got. We stole this ship. I'll pat him down. 18 for investigation. That's a lot. Okay. What looks to be a pouch of chewing tobacco. Okay, got it. Could be spice. Did we show him this letter? I know but, we don't know who this letter was written to, do we? We know who it was from and what it was telling the person-- wait no, it's from-- Ionos. Do you know Ionos? Do you know Ionos? Well I'm glad we killed a half dozen people to know what we already knew. (laughing) Sure, her name's right here. It says "Meet the Captain, Avantika." We could have asked. We don't have our dog anymore. We'll have a proper burial at sea. Everything went great. What would the captain have told us, though? Do we go on to the next town, or do we try to-- Oh my god.
