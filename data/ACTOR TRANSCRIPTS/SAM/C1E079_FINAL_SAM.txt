Yeah well, you know Backblaze is unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just $5 a month. You can go to backblaze.com/criticalrole for a full 15-day free trial, and I was going through my library. You know I have a whole library? Yeah and I dug up an old poetry book and buried inside there was a very curious poem by a young Dr. Seuss. Yeah. I know, I know. I thought I would read it for you all today. He printed it on his laser printer. But it happens to concern Backblaze. The drive did not spin. It just clacked and it clicked. I rebooted and prayed and gave it a swift kick. But my data was gone, poof, every byte and bit. And I cried, "How I wish I had backed up my shit!" But who should appear in a car that he revved? A zingity zangity furry red Yev. The Yev jumped through my window, he pounced on my mouse and said, "You must have wished Backblaze to your house." But I looked at him cross, shouting, "What "do you mean? My files are corrupt. This is one dead machine." He just laughed and said, "You daft "binkle blot, Backblaze works whether you remember or not. Your pics of your kids and the food that they "eated, all stored on the cloud. Nothing's ever deleted. Your docs, Firefox, alarm clocks, and "your socks will all be restored from our miracle box." The Yev yelled, "Don't worry from midnight "to morn, we save all your stuff, your taxes and porn. Your music and apps are safe on Backblaze." And with that, the Yev tipped his hat, "Good day." So remember, go visit backblaze.com and find the red Yev sing-singing his song. Let them take care of you heart and soul and tell him you're sent there by Critical Role. Oh! There's nothing offensive to Matt Mercer under this shirt. It's just another shirt progression to inspire us. This one goes four deep. (yelling) It's to inspire us in our final fights. It might be the last time I'm ever on this show, so I wanted it to be five of me. Yep, you did great. You are the best. For the final fight? My other brother. I'm really nervous. (laughter) Oh, good idea, good idea. Should I cause a distraction? Eight. I'll be bringing up the rear. That's how I like it anyway. Wow! Do whatever you do! We've been practicing for this our whole lives. I've never heard you say those words. Well, that was a valiant effort. You got tons of 8th-level spells, you'll be fine. No problem. Don't get back behind the fucking wall, don't get back behind the wall, we're all bunched up. Go somewhere else. Judges weighing in. What's your spell DC? Oh, that's something! 17 points, that's something! It's going to be great. He's dead. Shaun Gilmore! Oh, Kiki, you're okay! Can I Cutting Words to do anything? Just the damage, not his attack? Will it reduce the damage for everybody? If so, I will do that. It won't be much, but I'll do it. Yes. So as he goes, I will yell at him, oi! What sexual position makes the ugliest children? I don't know, ask your mama! (laughter) Guys, you can reduce that damage by five. So instead of 150, it's 145. 94! Oh shit. He has to look? 21. Wait, I thought you said I didn't save. Wait, wait, so I get 94 or 47? Oh, okay! That's not bad! And Matthew DM, do our temporary hit points go away first? Or last? We all did. 17, from our feast. So you prayed at him? Good job! Who that? Who that? Is that Kima? On herself? Okay. He's looking better. By committee. What do you mean any time you're healed? Do we get any healing from this as well? Yeah, well, you're not Pike. You don't know. You get a bonus action. You can do a Healing Word. I'll move ten feet towards that way, still ducking behind that stone there. I will inspire Percy. Wait, should I heal or inspire? I'll inspire Percy. I'll sing him a lovely Christmas song, (singing) You know Raishan and Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, Brimscythe and Umbrasyl, we killed in his room. But do you recall the most fucked-up dragon of all? Thordak the Cinder King had a very shiny gem. And if you ever saw it, run the fuck away from him. And for the move, I guess I'll attack him? I don't do that very well. I'll do Bigby's Hand. (sings) Bigby's Hand! At level seven. I guess keep it low. Just go for the ball shot, yeah. Punch. Just punch. 18. Actually, yes. That is my biggest thing, so yes. Wait a second, Matt! Doesn't he get a disadvantage on his save because of my Cutting Words? Yeah. That's what I meant. Making sure you guys know how spells work. Jesus, Sam #3, why didn't you tell me that?! You have an inspiration. Oh shit. That doesn't sound good. Is she lying? She's a deceitful one. We have the best friends. We hear Zahra in the distance, "I'm still alive!" After failing three? Do you get an attack, Grog? Wow. That's a hit. That's great! That's extra! That's just bonus. At disadvantage! He might have five of those. Oh shit. Lair action. Everyone with knees dies. (scoffs) You call this a lair? And looked good doing it. You're now 1/16 his size. Oh, whew. On the last one, I'm going to Cutting Words. Then on the last one. Well then, maybe that won't help. Can I Cutting Words that? So I yell at him, "You're so ugly, you scared the shit out of an outhouse!" Make that a 33. Does not? 21. 21. Hey, that's many points. Oh, God. What was that? He's straight-up crazy. When I was younger, I had an imaginary friend, too. No, well he gets full healing. Oh, shit. You can do that? That's all the attacks. What about the dragon sword? Did you do that? Not yet. There's no way, it's not going to happen. I mean, everybody. I'm up? For my attack, I will punch the fire elemental currently menacing Kiki with my fist of fury. Okay, 24. 8d8. I need all the d8s. Four... I need one more. That's a d12. (laughs) Oh man, these are all good, though. I do. Oh my God! Okay. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 30, 41. He's not dead? As my bonus action, I'll punch him again. That was my action, as a bonus action, I can do something else with Bigby, no? Every subsequent action I can do something as a bonus action, does that also negate the action? So I can't do it as my action? So that was my bonus action, then. So I can do something else, then? No, no, no, I'll do something else. Oh! By the way, I can't use my movement to drink a potion, right? Okay (laughs). Can I lean over the wall there? And I'll Lightning Bolt the same guy. All right, so. TALIESIN and Four ones in a row so far, so-- (laughter) Yeah, absolutely. Oh shit. So you only hit Grog. Little house on the prairie, with the dragon on it. Oh, god. No problem. (whispered) Big problem! Matt has been waiting a year for this. Does that affect the fire elemental, too? I don't. Sam Five has his theories, though. Oh, that's great. Focus on the dragon. "Focus on the dragon." You have resistance to poison clouds, remember? Success. Half damage. Hey, you caused damage! That's great! Can we say that she walked 30 feet closer to-- You could have cast it on the-- Does my hand need to make a save, as well? He does have it. Oh, no. Oh, god. No.SAM,  No!, TALIESIN, TALIESIN And the hand. The hand rolled a nine. Oh, god. Oh shit. I got him. I'm going to not let him die? (pouring drink) (contented sigh) Roll high. Roll strong. It's got a weak spot. Weak spot. In game, or right here? You've done your thing. Everybody's injured around her. Oh. I'll, through the earring, say, Grog, you want to go for a ride, or no? Okay, action, I will arc around and Lightning Bolt the dragon real quick. With the hand cone, I don't know if that makes any difference. No, it doesn't. It might. Yeah, great, so what, I still roll damage and he takes half? Okay. That's fine. 23. So, 12, 11, something like that. Great. We're doing great, guys, nobody's dead yet. And as the bonus action-- The Hand, who is still alive. He took 102 points of damage, but is still alive. Yes, because he has my hit points. So he'll go over and lift up Grog by the scruff of his neck and go as high and mighty as he can. He can move like 120 feet, I think. What? 120! Wait. Well, knowing that, I'll just punch the dragon. Nope. I mean, you don't know. Yeah, 23. It does hit! 6d8. No, it's usually 4d8, I think. So it's 4d8, so now it's 6d8. Oh, shit! No, 8d8. Pike happened. Oh my god, Ashley is the MVP tonight. (laughter) Yeah. Hey, I just dealt 47 points of damage! That's respectable! (approving murmurs) (whispering) Laura. That will inspire you. "Constructing a pole vault." What does that do? What? You have a thing? Did you roll your Cabal's Ruin thing? Have you taken any damage? Is this one of the fire giants we've seen? We have exactly one ally dragon in this fight right now. We do! She's great. Aw, he's still crazy. What's that other thing that you've been doing to him? That he has to save on every once in a while? But are you sure? Jarett, do you need some suude? Well, you look crazy right now. It's like a Thursday. Needs improvement. He flew 30 feet. You can also hold your attack until he's closer or something? Hey, 28 is great! You got a bonus action or something? You could heal or something? You've got potions and shit, don't you? He's hovering. God, he's going to his other Dungeons & Dragons game! (laughter) Oh God! That's dangerously close. Oh boy. I'll Cutting Words this. I have used only three. That means I have three left. Yep. So I will Cutting Words that up with a poem I will make up on the spot. Roses are red, Violets are blue, I'm a gnome, and you're an asshole. (laughter) Oh, you can reduce that by one point, Matt Mercer. My dexterity saving throw. Terrible, 15. Where's Pike? What's Pike doing? Matt, in the interest of honor, should I roll a concentration saving throw? I rolled a-- what do I add to it? Constitution? So 18. At least it won't eat up my Cutting Words any more. We're getting in flute range soon. Raishan? He has crazy glue on his person? Ooh! Is it really? 10d20. Worth it. You have another model? And it's even bigger. He's a little puny baby. He's so sad. Come on, Pike. For all the marbles. She's a perfect ten. Always was. Does Pike get an attack of opportunity? Jesus. What is she attacking with? Yes, she is. Oh yeah, the wyvern. That was really good handwork, I didn't catch any of it. That I got. She would heal Jarett over herself? Shit. I will use my action to pour my superior healing potion into Pike's mouth. Oh wait. First, I aerate it. (laughter) I don't know. What is it? Do I roll it, or does she? It's just a bunch of d4s? 8d4s? Oh my god. This is so many. Six. 13. 16. 20, plus something. Plus six, 26. Who else can I see? Nobody. Jarett's alive, right? Now as my bonus action... Well shit, I have an action, I can do anything. I can do anything! What? What flute? I play a shawm. What? How's she doing? Is she okay? It's not great. All right, I will attack the dragon. Bigby's Hand at level six. Why not? That is not what they want. I'll poke it. Nope. Did Pike help me out? 23. 6d8. Gimme. 27. I moved to Pike to pour stuff in her. That's all. I did not mean that in any weird way. You're not going to die. To do what? 23? Jesus! Where'd you go? Oh, shit, I forgot about that. Lair actions. Is Jarett in there? Natural 20, 25. Yeah, if he doesn't like it, he gets to reroll. Does Jarett get knocked to his feet? She's still on our side, right? I think he's got a shot. I'm not even paying attention, so if that's your concern. Oh yeah, that Vestige thing! Oh! Another chain. Is that a one? Yeah, one. You don't know numbers. Maybe it'll work. Holy shit! A dark hole? In a dark pit. Jesus. Don't forget, Backblaze is hosting a Critical Role giveaway. Anyone who signs up for a free trial with Backblaze at backblaze.com/criticalrole through January 8th will be eligible to win items signed by the Critical Role team that killed a dragon. I don't even know that guy! Oh, how's Pike doing? We're fighting this fucking giant thing? Jesus. I'm going to move out from my hidey hole. Oh god, there's a giant there. I think my Bigby's is still on the field, yeah. So I'll Bigby's Punch. Bigby Punch! A 24? 6d8, oh man. I only have one d8. I'll roll it six times. I'll roll it six times. That was four. You fuckers! Oh, shit, that was a lot! It's either 33 or 34, they fucked me up. But it was a lot! It was mostly sevens and eights! That was my bonus action. As my action, I will swig a Greater Healing Potion. What is that, four? Yeah, the potion doesn't do that for me, does it? Plus four? Four, three, two, one is ten, right? You're right, it's two less than I thought. I get a plus six when I cast it, because of my awesomeness. But not when I use a potion. Got it. Yeah, I think I'm done. Right? Plus three plus two plus one... What goes around comes around! Violence, violence! Who would've thought a fire giant would be so easy? He's volunteer fire department, yeah. Ah, there's a fucking wyvern? Keyleth! There's a wyvern on the field. Or you can ignore and go into the hole. (singing) Head to the hole! You've got nothing else to do. Yeah. I thought you did that already. She's just trying to ask a question, Vax. I mean, Jesus. We're men of our word. We're men of honor. I'm not saying she's great. Hmm. Oh boy. You stumped the chump. You got this, Bailes. What is it about? Saddest attack ever. Looting the giant's body? One. It takes one lick. My hand is near you. Yeah, for the rest of the one minute it works for. Which is not very long? Who's the three, Vax, Vex, and-- (singing) Muppet Babies... Wow, guys! That's really good rolling! Next year?! We have to wait a year?! No, she's dead. Matt Mercer. I have an 8 AM session. Of course she did, she cast a big spell to do it! What are you talking about? She read a scroll! Information!
