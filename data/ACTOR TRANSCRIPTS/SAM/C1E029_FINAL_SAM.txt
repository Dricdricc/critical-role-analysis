What do we need? We have to get water, right? There was some issue about-- we don't have any water, do we? I don't remember. There was some wells around. Oh hi, Vax. What? Are you guys disguised? Does that have a range? No, it just lasts. I'm coming. Great. We're still peasants. Oh, okay. Okay. Should we scout around and see if there's anything else around the hideout that we should be aware of, or any other hiding places, or safehouses? We need friends. Is there a central meeting place? Is that a place where you can really chat up brand new people? Or is there a pub? I guess it's not really a pub town, is it? Okay. We could go there. What's the other one? That sounds fun. I might! We're not trying to hide, are we? I rolled an 18 for something. I'm better deceiving. G'day, sir! I wish I had a yo-yo. Oh, the wheel and stick would be good. Well, I've got to stick with them, I guess, although I like being a young peasant boy. It's kind of fun. All right, I'll go with them. Is it safe? Should we go up? All right, Papa, let's go. This is what he does! Everything I have is short. I can just go in there and open it from the inside. It's not concentration, so I can just jump in there. Correct. It's not concentration, I don't think. I can say I want to go ten feet in that direction. Before I do, why are we trying to get in here? I thought it was to meet people. I don't think there's anyone in there. Okay, good enough for me. I go in. We do have earrings. 17. All right, how big is this thing that's keeping the door shut? A couple hundred pounds? 40 or 50 pounds?! And how high off the ground? Could I touch it? All right. I'm going to try and lift it off. Athletics? Hmm. Not good. 12! It's not going to do much. There's a big heavy thing. I get the sharp side?! All right. I feel like there's some sort of spell I could use. All right, let's just do it your way. Yeah, I've got a million things I could do. Bigby's is probably concentration, but I've also got a potion of strength. I thought it was. No, I want to follow this through. Plus strength. 12. (laughter) I'm going to take damage. Oh, I can't say "God damn it" in here. I'm in Pelor's-- Sorry, Pelor. God bless you. Gesundheit, Pelor. Man, all right. Well, jeez Louise. Seems like overkill. What about a Thunderwave? Can I do that? All right. Does it only affect living things? Or does it affect-- There are. There are windows. Good call. Are you sure? No, let's carry this out. Three hours later, we are still trying to open the door. I can Bigby's Hand. I'll just Bigby's Hand. It's up there. You can make it, but Percy can't. You could, probably. Yeah, but I could blast it. Would be very dramatic. To the right and up. The saga of the door! Hey! Oi! Your stupid idea cut my hand! With my good hand, yes. You know what, I'm going to get some assistance. I call my Unseen Servant to assist. He is going to lift with us. Hi, Darrell. That was a six. Is that for me? So, five extra to that is 11. Right? No? Oh, I see. Four. So that's a nine. All right, I'm doing it. Step back! All right, I summon Bigby's Hand! The mightiest hand that will ever unlock a door, ever! (singing) Bigby's Hand! 12. Plus eight? 20! It took three spells to open this door! Three spells! Three spells and I injured myself. Welcome, Percy. All of us? 15. Who? Reynal? Okay. It couldn't just be ash from the thing that is burning? Paper. It's a golden ticket. Copy? They're making guns! To do what? Someone who is working with Sylas, right? Okay, I'm going to go up on the altar. Was there a small something on the altar? Can I tell how he died? 23. Not teeth. Are there any holy symbols or anything that we might take to give to Keyleth to, I don't know. Wasn't she gonna-- I don't know. Do some holy shit? 19. What's that? I grab Percy, and I make us both go invisible. So, what is that, a 3rd-level Invisibility spell? Ugh! What if she was a good guy? What if it's a good banshee? Some of the banshees that I've met have been decent. We're rolling for initiative? I'm glad I used half my spells trying to get into this goddamn place. Jesus, Matt! I got a seven. Well, I can't do anything. 11. I also always have advantage, so do I get to roll a third time? Not only do I shake it off, I gird my loins! So, we're fighting it with wooden stakes? Does our meal help us with that at all? Okay. 16. What? No! No, he can't. Oh, god. Very quickly. Should we flee? In a little bit? Okay. Oh, that's right! God damn it. Shit. I'll just Lightning Bolt her. Him. It. Whatever it is. Oh, just damage? Oh, 8d6. Do I get my hand cone? So, 19. 8d6. Great. Nope, that's it. I just need help counting. 16, five, 21, 27. 34. Okay. I will move back a bit. Away from the thing. And I will-- Oh! We have people. Okay, and then I can, as a bonus action, still get a bonus? I will heal him, this doofus here. Okay, yeah. (singing) I'm bring health points back. Yeah! You mothafuckas don't know how to act-- Yeah! That's all I got. (singing) Take it to the bridge! Yeah, but maybe I should do it at a-- Just get you up? Okay. 1d4 plus something? Two plus whatever. Six? Eight? It's 1d4 plus five, so it's seven points. That's two! It does? If he dies once, comes back and dies again, is that two? Hey, should we leave? Damn it! All right. I don't think Eyebite's going to work against it. So, fuck, I'll cast Bigby's Hand at 6th-level, then. I don't have any more 5th-level slots. So, I'm just going to make it even bigger. I don't even know what it does. Okay. Yes, I think-- I'm going to bitch-slap it, but the forceful hand. So I can just push it far away from us. Possibly to the front door. Yeah. It takes no damage for that? All right, so then I'll just hit it. I'll just hit it hard. 14. Plus, what am I adding? Oh, nine. Plus nine. 6d8. I don't even know what those are. That's a ten. There they go. I got one. I'll just roll it six times. 24? Even at 6th-level, that's all it did. What? What? But I'm so little and wee! Yes, I lift myself up with Bigby's Hand. Yeah, that was a great idea. Whoa! Oh shit! Percy! I will also sing for him a Song of Rest, which is just another d6. Yeah. Oh, are we clear of danger? What are we doing here? Should we check this other room first, before we go? Quickly, though, quickly. 22. Any provisions that we can take? Water, food? Well, let's leave them a sign. We're supposed to be sowing discontent, right? So, let's leave a sign that someone was here and fucked up their shit. Do you want me to pee on the altar? No, don't leave your dagger; it's your only one left. Whoa, this is our sign? That's a lot of words. Deception, please. (sings a ditty) I'm just a peasant boy. 32. I blacked out the windows. At night? Use the green one. This is you doing greenery. Natural 20. Easy. Or a six. So, the ground is cursed. Well, poo. You know what we need to do? Hydroponics. No ground, just grow it above. Guys, I just want to say that I killed a door and a banshee, so-- Yeah. The door was harder to kill. Who's that? Is that who they were talking about today? The group? Oh, Sir Kerrion. I thought they said something else. You think if we find him, kill him, and leave his body on some sort of public display, it would sow some seeds of rebellion? We could. Grog, could you do something nasty to his body? All right. Ask around? Let's just go house to house and kill everyone in all of them! Yes. We could be Mormons. Until noon tomorrow, right? Yeah! 17. I don't even know where that is on the sheet! "Logenzes?" Sir Kerrion. Only one way to find out. Burn every house down except for those three mansions and see who runs out. You want to all be peasants again? Can we not just disguise ourselves in tattered clothes? Oh, wait. We could just leave the bear behind. He could guard this safe house, and then we could go find another safe house. All right, fine. Seeming it is. We're all peasants and he's a donkey. And I'm a little boy. Of course you can! I'll give you two crazy eyes. Is there a basement? Oi, Grandma! Any yo-yos in there? Oh, until noon. Thanks, grandmama. Let's just take a walkabout and see if there's anything else around the area. Are there guards out front or anything, or is it just a gate? Do you want me to go in? Just, whoever's in there? Well, you know. I'm just a little peasant boy. Is anyone else on the street? I bet it's empty. I mean, it's a temple. The other one was. I thought so, too. I can just pop in there and see who's in there and pop out. I'm just a peasant boy. You wouldn't kill a harmless peasant boy. Let's get out of here. Take a walk, we're going to take a walk. Towards the Lady's Chamber. We're not going in. Have we passed any people? Can I go talk to them? Oi, excuse me? My papa sent me to send a present, a gift of sorts, to a Sir Keri? Kurion? Kerrion? We're just looking to see where we can deliver the gift. 29. (laughter) The one right over there? She's blind. Okay. I just need to bring him this sack of presents, or my papa will whip me pretty bad. You're so pretty and clean. I'm her seeing-eye boy. (laughter) (singing) Consider yourself! (speaking) Oh, that's a different show. But they're allowed to assemble? To the-- To the house. And who is she to you? Wait, she's the one who killed a bunch of your people, right? Like a Flintstone's vitamin. Except it's assassination. Do you need some healing? Are you okay? Scanlan can make you feel good. He's probably been up tinkering all night. Any other safe houses? Potential candidates? Yes, but after we kill this thing, we're going to need to know where to go. Thoughts? We need a place to retreat to immediately. It's an amphitheater isn't it? Shouldn't we have a backup plan, in case they turn us out onto the street? That's a good plan. They probably have some good wine. All right. Let's go assassinate someone. They also have technology, now. They have weapons, guns, that they're developing. It could be a threat to many, many other people. As the oldest among us, I say that he's fine. Well, I assume so. How old are you people? Yeah. Let's go. Vax, you have your daggers back, right? Percival? If we get in there, what are the chances that this gentleman, Sir Kerrion-- Korean-- Sir Starbucks. What are the chances that he's going to be in a coffin? Sleeping? Okay. All right. Good to know. Ooh, that's a cool plan. I like that plan! Oh, wait, but I would be bait? Okay, fine. The rain will dampen the screams from inside. So we go around once? Once around? Perception check. I'm looking for clouds because I rolled a two. They're watching TV. Ooh, thank you! Is our meal still affecting us? Yes! Let's go in quick! There's two guards. Should we do a diversion for the guards? Yes, but once we go through the fence, they might. I don't know. All right, you want to sneak in? All right, sure! If I puffed some smoke, would it draw attention to us? Okay, then never mind. Is that going to burn his hands? It's raining. It'll be fine. Why don't you just hit it with something? But that'll be loud! Plus ten. 17. They might. Okay! Wait, what? You rolled a three and it becomes a 20?! One room at a time? We have to get up through this latch and there's people right above us! I think you should have some fun, too. But before we do anything, do you want me to send a cloud up there of gross smoke to smoke out the area? LIAM and It'll be fine. What could go wrong? This is a stealth mission. We'll be in and out of here in six minutes if we do this right. Let's go! Go, go! Bonne chance! Vive la résistance! Hold? Two gentlemen! Grog up first! 18. That was plus ten. Do you want me to create a diversion of some sort? No? Are we going to go around? Who's they? As they go, I quickly lock eyes with Grog and I give him a quick little inspiration. (singing) Blood, glorious blood! Grog's about to take some. Dead dudettes and dudes, Grog's about to make some! (laughter) Oh! Can I? Trinket stay. (laughter) de Rolos, roll out! (scream and cheer) Are you alert? Do you have Alert? Is that what it is? Ooh! 16! Better figure out what I'm going to do! What does that do? Potbelly. Jesus! God! Okay, so he's been attacking the old guy. Those two flanking the big boss are just guards, right? They're just standard-issue guards? All right, well, I'm going to run in the room. Make a left. I'm sorry, turn right, away from the action. And then I'll look at the guard behind and to the right of the big guy. The good guy-- the bad guy. No, this guy over here. And I'll Dominate him. Yes. I pull up my hand cone and I say, (singing) You're as cold as ice! Willing to sacrifice your boss! And so I tell him to kill his boss. (laughter) 19. Yeah, that's it. Good god! After she does that, I say that was my grandma! (laughter) Take that, Sir Korea! 66?! That's 15, is 70-- is 81. Any? He wouldn't be surprised after the first one. It was 15, so it becomes 30. That is the most peasant-looking direwolf ever. Whoa. Damn. What? You're weird. Will this take an action? Okay. I think that's next. Oh no, that's some sort of healing thing isn't it? He has 6,000 health points. Ooh! That's nothing! Turn invisible. Wait, who did that? LAURA and Who? Oh. Well, I can't see anyone who's alive who I haven't Dominated already, except for the guy under the dire wolf. I will remind all my fellows to keep one alive to spread our terrorist message and I will run out to the hallway and say, Vex, get inside. Because I know reinforcements are coming, I cast Stinking Cloud out into the hallways. (singing) Stinking Cloud! It says 90-feet range, let's see here. 20-foot radius. Yeah. Will it seep into the room as well? Oh. Well, can I stop just short of the door? Sorry, Vex. Okay, I will hold that until she comes in the room. Laura's next, I believe. And I will inspire her, as well. Do you want a d10? Okay. (singing) Vex be nimble, Vex be quick! Vex jump under limbo stick! Now you don't know how you're going to react because Vex has an attack! Oi! There two invisibles, and then another soldier who I have already Dominated. He still hasn't had a turn?! Is that including your brother? No, she's next to the desk. Mark that shit. Faerie Fire is an underused thing. It's really cool. Yes! Now's a good time to go to the store and check out Critical Role t-shirt-- Brand new t-shirt for sale, guys. On me?! Jesus. I don't even know any more. No one's attacked me in a while. It's 17. Well, it's 15 plus two because I've got some thing on. I thought so, too. That would have been good! Wait. Who's this? That's not my guy, Matt. Oh, that guy there is, yeah. Oh wait, he's attacking my guy? On my spell? It's 19. Wow! How do you want to do this? That's the logo that's on the shirt that's for sale right now. Too late. Oh wait, you told me to! I could have; I didn't. Fuck! (laughs) He's disturbed. He's Vouk-ed. Good, yes, keep him alive. Scanlan's up? All right. I go run up to the guard I have dominated, and I just-- Is he still dominated, can I change the domination? I mean, can I change it from "kill your boss" to-- To "give up"? No, I will tell him-- No, what? Oh. Ooh! That's good. Okay. You there, guard! Go tell everyone that everything's fine. Go into that Stinking Cloud out there and tell all your friends that everything's hunky-dory. Is it? Oh, okay. The domination. Stinking Cloud is concentration? It is! I never wrote down a C next to it. You mean the thing that Orion took from me? Yeah, the thing that I needed? Yeah. Yes, so I tell him to go warn his friends-- not warn his friends. Tell his friends that everything's fine. All is good. I'm going to go to the desk. A giant attacks. 19. We can interrogate him, though. Get crucial information. He's an officer. Anything on the desk, papers of any sort? It's a lot. Yeah, it's tons. It's 27. I got it. I'll take it. Vouk's. Turn away, look in the corner, Blair Witch style. (laughter) Grog, do you want to? Are you on Vouk's right? Or whatever-his-name? I can put him to sleep. But I have to drop my thing first. Well, he already told his friends in the hallway-- That everything's fine. So now we're just knocking him out. I walk next to him and sort of distract him with a little soft shoe tap. (laughs) Percy? Where are the Briarwoods? -- in the palace? Just nod or nod. He can do spells. Are they in the palace? Sometimes. (laughs) This is mumblecore. I cast Blindness on him. Don't know if he's blind. Oh, he's blind. He's blind. Are they working on explosives? He can't see anything. All right. I drop Blindness and I drop Seeming. Those giants. Who controls them? His eyes, too? I cover Keyleth's eyes. It's a very complicated symbol. (laughs) Where are we going after this? Trinket's downstairs. We should leave Trinket. They don't know where we live. We're trying to make everyone know that we're here. We can stay the night before we release him and burn it down. Although there are a bunch of guards around. MARISHA and All right, just burn it, then. Let's get out of here. We can go back to our old hideout. We have the tavern. No one's found it. Hey, wait a second here, Vax. That was an enforcer. He kept the people oppressed. He worked for the Briarwoods and punished all of these farmers for not bringing enough taxes and enough tithes. Well, that's what a rebellion is. We can just leave it as a symbol of our terror. Somewhere else. Percy, is that last barrel for you? No. These guards aren't going to stay out for long. We should set fire and get out of here. Grog, can you carry this unconscious guard out on our way out? Sir Kerrion's body? Can you carry both of those fuckers? No, there's the unconscious guard and the body. You have fire hands. Back to the tavern, then. 19. I found seven gold. Is the Hitler on the poll at all? (groaning) The Charlie Chaplin.
