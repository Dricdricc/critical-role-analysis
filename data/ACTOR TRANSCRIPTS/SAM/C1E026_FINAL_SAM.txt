Not everyone. We're missing two. A male and a female. Maybe he needed some comforting. I'm not saying that. Okay, but if there's a sock or a gun on the doorknob, don't go in. Oh, beard check? All right, let's go! (laughter) My god, Grog. Percy's a hoarder. Or he's in serious distress. The hoarder? We must find him, don't you think? Our friend's in trouble. I proceed down to his tinkering lab. Doesn't he have some sort of lab downstairs? Well, that goes with your character. Can I reach the eye vent? No, he's working too hard. Maybe we should just leave him be. Seems focused, driven, like a madman. I don't think you do. Would you like a meal brought down? All right. If you're making things, a little ladder for the little perch here might be nice. Just in the future! But not now. That seems low priority. All right. So we go back up. Tell the fellows, Percy's in a mood. He's creating right now. I think we should just leave him be. Yes. I know. Percy's hate-smelting downstairs. Yes. I feel responsible. \ What? No, spit it out. What did he say? It seems important. Is it fuck? Is it shit? Thought he was just trash-talking. You think there's more to it? Well, we all have some secrets. That's a fair point, though. We'll keep an eye on him. He seems to be in a fragile state right now. Did we kill her? I thought we just made her sleep and then walked away. Tiberius, you killed an old woman? Are you saying that we should take it down a notch? Or maybe not brutally destroy the bad guys? I made her go to sleep. That was peaceful. Are you taking moral exception to some of our behavior? Well, this is something perhaps you should pray on and think on. If there's something you'd like us to change about our behavior, we can consider that. We're all friends. We're allies here. We should pay respect to you. All right. You know, this is constructive criticism, and we'll take it as such. And I, for one, will maybe not desecrate and denigrate bodies. Oh, I'll shit on things. Maybe not people. He can't count. This is an intervention. We love you very much, but you killed an old lady. Kill softer. Let's table this. We'll stick a pin in this discussion. We'll all be thinking long and hard about this. Did she see the fight? There were those guards, too. There was guards outside the door. Oh yeah. Well, he's not feeling well today after the events of last night, so he stayed behind. I get advantage, and I rolled a 27. Cleric Tristan also treated him last night for his vampire-inflicted wound. I know this all looks really bad on the surface, and we did not want to cause any disturbance within these hallowed walls, but there was a danger, we acted. Perhaps too abruptly and without telling you. If you're worried about lies within your own ranks, I think you should start with him. Help him? Oh! (chanting) What ability? Objection! That's it. I just wanted to say that. Please continue. I just want it noted that we object strongly to this. Are we still allowed free rein to roam about as we please? Are we under arrest for anything? Are we allowed to speak with Allura? I look forward to the second parade you'll throw for us after our names are cleared. We'll break in tonight and find it. Keyleth, what happened? Your magic didn't work? But Asum lied. It must mean that we have something to fear from Uriel. Or someone else close. Proof would help. Hey! Don't we have a prisoner? Can't we question the prisoner? We should question him. He could have proof. We get it! You want her body. Now's not the time. What the shit happened in there? It looks bad, but she was a threat. Yes, but that might not be proof enough for them. Someone could have corrupted your mind. What sort of proof do you think they would accept? The head of Lady Briarwood? No one insight checked her. All right. So wait. What are our avenues? We're going to have to Columbo this. What are our avenues of finding proof? We have a prisoner we can question. Who knows if that will yield anything. And then, we might have to go gather evidence, which means leaving town against his word. No! And then the next step will be to seek out Seeker Asum? How many errands do you have to run? All right. Go run your errands! We've got a mystery to solve. He's got a list. It's a busy day. Coming soon on Friday nights The Adventures of Tiberius's Errands! 700 to 1000 every Friday night on Twitch. Wait, what? Say that again. They're our handlers, probably. We're all going! A ring of what? I think I do? Grog, keep in mind, these are our allies. We hate old people. (laughter) Legit what? Old people? We are Vox Machina. I'm sure word of us has spread far and wide. We're a pretty big deal. Why have you made this journey to us? However, despite what my companion is saying, we are not agreeing to go after this winged beast quite yet. We hear your plight, and we sympathize, and we will do what we can, but we have very pressing matters right now. Is there a deadline of some sort? When is your next harvesting season? To your farm. We are friends of the elderly, obviously, and also of the farming community, so we are very interested in helping you. May we talk about it a bit before we decide how and when we would tackle this problem? And have they ever messed with a human? Here. My business card. We were just having a conversation about how we should try to be nice from now on. But we do have very pressing matters. I call up to Cordell. Oi, Cordell! Remember when I told you not to let anyone linger outside the keep? By all means, use your judgment over the orders of your master. That's fine. We had a really bad dinner last night. That's all. Kit Buss, ladies and gentlemen! We're the worst. I mean, his friends all died, so. Let's not have this conversation in front of the prisoner. What's your name, boy! Are vampires. Have there been any strange goings-on in their residence? Sounds you've heard? People disappearing? Boxes coming in or out? We can protect you. We are safe here in this keep, and you're surrounded by very powerful allies now. You also caught us on a day where we're trying to be nicer to people. (laughter) From the Briarwoods? So moody! He's a friend. I know it doesn't seem like it from the condition of your paw, but he's a friend. He's in the same boat as you, trying to stay safe from danger. Yes. Well, have we stationed a guard down there? All right. I'll go talk to Cordell. That's his name, right? Is that Kendrick? Or Shayne? Oh, the girl? Jarett? All right, we'll get Jarett. Oh, Jarett? We need you to watch a prisoner for us, downstairs in our jail cell, which we had built and are now using. You'll be guarding the prisoner to make sure he doesn't escape, but also making sure he stays safe. He possesses information that's very valuable to us. And one of the people who hires you might try to kill him, so if Percy tries to go in there, can you stop him without hurting either party? You think you could take Percy? Wow! Jarett, you're ballsy! Just out of curiosity, if he was running at you, what would you do? (laughter) A little bit! Do you need anything to help? All right. Well, keep him safe and there's an extra five gold in it for you? I don't know! Ten! Ten gold! I don't know how money works. We'll talk to Vex about it. Did you eat the flask? I encourage sandwich! (laughter) I think everyone left. I think it's just you and me up here, and drunk Tiberius. Wall of Thorns could be good. That's pretty big! Oh, 60 feet long. I thought you meant high. Listen, Percy's here. He can defend for us. Why don't we just leave someone behind? 300. We just established this. We're going to wait until night and go. The plan is we're going to let him sober up. We're going to give him some coffee. And then we're going to set off for the north farmlands at dusk. Well, with Cordell. Jarett's down in the cell. This is defense against invading vampires. Oh my god. Great! Do it. Make it done. Let's go kill a bird. You've got to talk it through. Don't talk to him. I use Minor Illusion to create Lockheed, and I have him scamper away. No, just don't. Okay! Listen. Let's just go. Great! We're here to help. We're the heroes that you asked for. Where do you think we should stake out this bird? Where are your livestock kept? Sure. Kyle. The neighbor boy. The neighbor boy's son. Yes. Don't worry, we're friends. We're friends of the Klauses. Mr. and Mrs. Klaus. Where have they been attacking lately? When it picks up a cow or whatever it's been picking up, does it strike with the beak or the claws? The talons. Wait! Before you leave. I'm sorry. I have an itch. And it can only be scratched with a cowbell. Do you have a cowbell anywhere around here? I just need a cowbell. Can I borrow a cowbell from you? I'm not a child! Great. It will help the ruse. Here's my plan we're all cows. Is that an okay plan? Yes, we're our own bait. Are you cool with that? I can get rid of it. You and me, Grog. We're cows! I can turn us all into cows. Seeming. We'll just seem like cows. What? No. You can't change size, but we can all be Grog-sized cows or Scanlan-sized cows. What do you think? MATT and Gather close to me! Yes, let's go into the pen, and if I may, I'm going to wear the cow bell. It's "cow-moo-flage." (groaning) We just will seem like cows. (barks) Oh, wait. No. Keyleth, what vital information have you learned? I, for once, and it's not weird, I just shit on the floor. (laughter) All right, so we go out into the field. Not quite. Is it wisdom or charisma or something? Do we have to roll for initiative? Six. It's not a beast? Is it our turn yet? Okay. I Dimension Door. 500 feet. On it. On its back. 20! Okay. As my bonus action, I will inspire Keyleth. Right? She's right next to me? (singing) The way you kick so much ass like nobody else. The way you do animal things gets me overwhelmed. You don't know. You don't know you're powerful. Oh. That's what makes you powerful. It lasts eight hours. Athletics? Well, that doesn't count. That's not good. Athletics? 16. Don't worry about me! I'm fine! You never need to worry about me. Haven't you guys learned that by now? I'm fine! That's amazing! I'm a cow on a cow with a cow! I will become a pterodactyl. Polymorph on myself? This is a concentration not on holding a spell, but on casting it? Charisma? That's a natural 20. (cheering) I think so. I'll check. Nope, not concentration. It just lasts for eight hours. Does that affect any spells? It doesn't drop Hunter's Mark? There's a C next to it somewhere. Yeah, stick to the bows and arrows. Wait, you sense that he came to a stop? Let's go get him. I'm a pterodactyl, so-- (pterodactyl screech) Five. What are we going to do? Like Avatar? Nothing. To a wildlife preserve? Are they on the highest peak? I'm going to swoop up over them. See if there's any boulders to drop. Fly? Oh, here. That's good. That's good. Diplomacy. Are you landing somewhere? I'm way up above them still, right? Do I see anything? I gently start swooping down to check on my friends. Bye, Keyleth. This is how we lose one of our members. Feeding a bird. Is it? Is it a good girl? And say, ow. All I've seen so far is Keyleth's bloody hand. I'm going to drop Seeming and also drop my form of pterodactyl. Is there a young creature around here besides the-- There's no babies there? Where are we telling them to go? Vasselheim? I start speaking in Gnome to him. Listen. Earlier, you said that this place was perfect. It was safe. There were no large predators. Well, you're looking at six large predators. We'll keep hunting you down and hunting your beast down until you get out of here. This is your one and only warning. You must leave, and you must leave now. We're giving you a good choice, a safe choice. We can help you get there and be safe there. But if you don't listen to us, we'll start killing. Persuasion? 32. Several days' journey. We can draw you a map. We can give you provisions. We'll even make sure the farmers provide you with a few pieces of livestock to chow down on before the journey. A parting gift to fuel up before the big ride. We can give you papers to hand to the Slayer's Take that will ensure that you'll be treated fairly. I bow deeply and when I do, it goes (cowbell ringing). We've got to go to the farmers. We've got to buy some cows off them. Sorry. (laughs) Sorry about that. Yes, just put them out in the open field. Oh, we'll take them? Okay, we'll take care of it. Wow. That was a crazy night. I gave you my hand.
