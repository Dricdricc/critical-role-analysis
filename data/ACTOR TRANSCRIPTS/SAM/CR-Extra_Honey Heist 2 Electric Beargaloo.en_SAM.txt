(whispering) Say the title. (whispering) Say the title of the game! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Roll for bear. Honey. (giggles) She would. Hey! Ooh! (whispers) Bear sense! Hey, (stuttering) how's it going, Trinket? It's been a while since we've seen you. I'm coming down off a meat bender. I haven't eaten meat in so many years. I couldn't resist anymore. I had so much. (sniffles) I'm coming down pretty hard. (sniffles) You got any meat? I needed that. I can't. I just fell off the wagon. What do you mean? What's going on? There was some honey. I thought we were out of this game. I thought we were going legit. Now he's pulling us back in. No, no, no. It's impenetrable. Impenetrable! Can't be done. I don't know. I'm a little shook up still. I got these headaches and fevers. I need a little more meat and then I'll be okay. I haven't had bamboo in three months. It's why I've been turning to the meat. Coming, Las Vegas? One more time for old time's sake? Saking it for the olds. Wait, what? I am The Driver. I'll be fine. Just got to keep it between the two yellows. The small guy. You have been working out a little bit. That's why you're always asleep. While you guys start thinking up a plan, I'm going to indulge in some bamboo, if that's all right with youse. I need it bad. I need something bad. I got the jitters. I got the shakes. I got the bear legs. I got the upstreams. That's where you try to pee, but it goes upstream. That's smart. Okay. I'm going to try to eat some bamboo. Calm myself down. I succeeded. This is the stuff. I haven't tasted this in so long. Thanks, Trinket, for the hookup. That meat, it does terrible things to the system. It's really awful. Not the same thing. Have we heard of him? I don't know. I've heard of this guy. He doesn't just kill you, he declaws you first. Yeah. He's bad business. Like what? They were there? Where was it? Do you want to flash back to it? I'm going to need a little more flashback. You know it. I can't count. (roaring) As what, though? No offense. He meant no offense. All right, so hats first. Sure, sure. Hats 'N' Things! Are there any wagons around? Or things with wheels? Is it attached to a horse? All right. I'm going to go grab it. I don't know what I'm going to do! I'm going to grab it and try to hitch myself to it. And try to, I don't know-- blast in front of the guard and hopefully-- Yeah. Blast in front of the guards and have them all come on, jump up. Okay, that's a success. I'll just-- (panting) Hop on, guys! Hop on! I'll get us out of here! Wow, bear-vantage. Hey, hey, I got this cart. Someone want to jump on it? And hop on the roof? He didn't break down the door. LIAM and Oh, okay! I'm going to back it up (beeping). I'm going to go full throttle and try to slam the side of the cart into the door. I've got afterburners. For which? That's a success. Something made of bamboo? I'm going to try to scoot right through this alleyway that I didn't even see before, but it's just tight enough to fit through. Oh, that's a big fail. I didn't see the overhang! (laughter) Succeed does nothing, right? I'm still running full speed. Just give us the number. Nice. The muscle always gets the fez. We're rolling a d8 for this. Three, that is a bowler. I'll go with green, the colorful one. Oh boy, look at that, I'm like the Riddler. MARISHA and You have multiple fezzes just in case? No, it's a yarmulke. What, you know something we don't? That's our brains. Want us to come with you? How do we know that you're not going to keep the good stuff yourself and give us the dregs? I'd feel more comfortable if one of us went with you. Definitely the brains of the operation. Trenchcoat of invisibility. A melon baller? You're not in there. You're outside. He's the brains. You're going to break into the castle? Waiting. Smell it. Okay, okay. Server bears. It's a little piece of heaven. Hey, let's not talk politics, let's just do the job. No, what could go wrong? Do you need any backup? Now, with those two hats on, you sure it won't look like you're trying to sell bibles or something? A man? On his fur? Wow. You got this. I don't know! Ugh, I just finished throwing up in the corner. I'm going to need some bamboo pretty soon. I'm going to ask the bartender if I can have an ice bucket filled halfway with honey and then stuffed full of bamboo stirring sticks. I'm going to go crazy on the bamboo and hang back on the honey. May I take a point of bear? If I want to? I will stick with what my current-- So slick. On the way out from the setup, I'm going to do a scan around. Are there any servers pushing any carts of any sort, like with plates or anything on them? I would like to try to steal the unattended drink cart. What? Oh, because I'm a driver. I'll take the lower, and that's a success. Do I move one point over, then? Okay, cool. That could not have gone better. We got a little information, we got a little mobilization. You don't need all those riches and luxury. You just need the bare necessities. We're going to go get these smugglers? I can fit one of you, maybe. What? We all have four legs, we can walk much faster than this. These small wheels do not do well on this dirt path. This is very inefficient! In bear or in human? Everybody stop. Oh wait, I'm pushing. I'll stop. Who's talking, the polar bears? Hey, calm down. Listen, look at me. I'm half you. What is your cause about? Yeah. Pound it out. What is this cause of yours that you're trying to convert people to do? You know, it's true. Every time I've heard talk about polar bears, everyone insults their dicks. And it's not right! I mean, looking at your dick right now, it seems just below average, but just below. A game? What kind of game is this, like a roleplaying game, or a-- Sorry, that's insensitive of us. Yeah, if you let our friends go by, we'll play the game with you. So what's our angle here, guys? What is happening right now? Yeah, what if a dick just falls? It's true. Yeah. That dick is moving! Oh, sorry! I got flustered there, I got the jitters. One second, Polar. What happens if we lose this game? What are the stakes here, again? There are literally no stakes to this? Hey, care to make this interesting? If we win this game-- No. Liam Las Vegas, please. Maybe you could give us safe passage up to the interior of Fort Lox. Well, could you at least give us some means of travel that's slightly more advanced than this cart full of champagne glasses? If we win. Oh, watch your hat. Come on, Trinket. That seems like a bad idea. I don't know about that one. I could have sworn that was the point of the game. This is not a good a good move, Liam Las Vegas! I haven't had enough bamboo! I don't know if I can do it! I got it! I'm sorry! Easy, easy! Hey, polar. Now that we've known each other a couple minutes, be honest. You ever had sex before? No, right? I mean, come on, nobody who spends as much time gaming-- what happened? BRIAN and Just keep those blocks erect and you'll be okay. Oh. The stakes could not be lower. Oh boy. It's getting down to it. Man, this game really stinks. Like it smells bad. Smells like balls. All right, I guess I get-- There's no-- I got nothing. I hit in a dick. I did graze the dick. I still don't understand this game! How would that even stay? How is that going to stay? I don't understand! You can't hit that dick! It's been an honor. It really gripped me and pulled me. It tugged me right into the game. I'm going to go to sleep. What's this game called? We're all Poohs? Adorable sometimes. What's the code? Just out of curiosity, where is your daughter right now? Today is the day of her wedding? You must be so proud. Who's she marrying? Who's going to be the new Pooh? Who's going to carry on the Pooh name? Oh. He's one of those mysterious types. I understand, Mr. Pooh, you don't want to give away too many details. These are personal questions, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I apologize. No, not at all! I was just curious. Is that okay? Wow. She really likes that French Stewart movie. That's why he's The Brains, always thinking. Thinking hard. Keep us on track. We'll bring back a wedding gift in honor of you and your daughter. And her mystery husband. Yeah, thank you bear-y much and bear-well. We got a cart. We've got some supplies. Hey, Brains. Waffle, I've been thinking about this code. He said it was between salmon and bamboo. If you rearrange the letters in those words, you get either No MÃ¡s Boom, Moon Samba, or Las Mambo. All right, I'll limber up. Do we have any way of lighting them? Are there any candles around? All right, then let's go do this caper. It's amazing. Starting to get the jitters again. I'm steering the ship. I'll roll to see if I can find something. What am I rolling for, criminal or bear? That's a fail. Do I lose a bear point? Oh, a point goes into bear. I'm just getting the jitters again, I need a little bamboo. Yeah, I brought a little bit. In his throat? At least three. In his throat. You've been working out. Oh, I just had the jitters. I'm going to run at the thing and try to bite its face off! That's a success. I'm going to eat through the bamboo and try to chomp his face to death. I'm going to try and spit out the meat and keep the bamboo. It's like bloody bamboo. My stomach's churning. We vegans are crazy. I search his body for any items. That's a fail. So I lose criminal? You got a code? LIAM and Is it a puzzle or is it just the code? Tell me, was the code las mambo? Wait. Don't the Bear Acuda read backwards though, on the page? Okay. (laughter) That's amazing code breaking! He's a code breaker. He's a windtalker. I think I could fashion something out of these. Yeah, but it's a narrow corridor, so it's not going to be a cart. I'm going to make us a really long motorcycle. Kind of like tandem bike, with five wheels. Like a Tron bike, sort of, with extra wheels. We got to get in first. Oh, Quincy de Bolo, yeah. All right, let me see if I can make this contraption. Okay, with your help. I might need you to bed a couple of iron rods around, axles and stuff. This isn't an inherent bear skill. Oh, good! There's a little blood residue. I don't like it. Yes, Flintstones style! Oh, boy. That's pretty good. Okay, we'll call it Good Tidings. Yeah. I'm going to ride in the front, so I can steer. I think it's a Christmas thing, I don't really know. We'll all get on. There's enough seats for all of us except you, Las Vegas, I'm sorry. You'll have to ride on somebody's shoulders. Okay, we all have to pedal with our feet? All right, there's one more thing! The only way this thing works is if we all go like this (motorcycle imitation) at the same time, or else it won't go. Ready? Deep breath! On a count of three! One, two, three. (motorcycle imitations) I'm going to remember back to when we had just played that board game. When I had just said to the gentleman Your dick is just below average. When he looked down is when I swiped one of the pieces of the board game, one of the ice chunks. I've been concealing it this whole time. (slowly) It's okay. I'm going to throw a board game piece at the other guy! Yeah, I got a point back for the flashback. Okay. That's still a fail! MATT, TALIESIN, and Oh, man! Is he wearing ninja clothes? We're going to need one more thing from you. Take off your clothes. Give me those. I start ripping them to shreds. The Sweet Brothers are stone cold. That was the zoo. Are you okay, Trinket? You're shaking a little bit. You look a little crazy right now. Mount up, everybody. I've invented something. Put these wads of fabric in your mouth. They're mufflers. We still got to make the sound, but now it will be quiet. (muffled speaking) (muffled) We're riding out! (braking sound effect) (spitting and coughing) Very uncomfortable. Is that a cow thing? What is that? How do we break open this door? Put a muffler on it! Oh, it worked! I got a little bit. Do you like bamboo? It's kind of like-- I got no more bamboo left, though. How? Yes, how do you make the beavers happy? Oh! That's what everyone wants, just a nice guy. We're looking for something loud and shiny, right? I'm going to open a crate or two. I'm going to sit on a crate, see if I can open it with my panda weight. That's a success. Oh, go from bear to criminal. Ugh! I got something here, guys! You're The Brains, look at this thing. That's a hookah pipe. Hey, listen, he's got the right to bear arms, it's okay. He can do it. We should keep those together probably, right? There's something about you and that pistol. Should we abandon crate? Should we keep going? I can give it one more shot if we want. I'll sit on one more. Success. Written in bear? It says "Salmon, salmon, bamboo, bamboo, salmon, salmon, bamboo." It's going to take me a while to decipher. It's written in sema-bear. It says something about-- It seems to be a thing that we can use to magically summon someone to help us. So only if we get in dire straits. This makes far more sense. Okay. It's just a really more powerful one of these. (laughter) Yeah. It was salmon, salmon, salmon, salmon, bamboo, salmon, bamboo. He's getting up there in criminal. I've got the motorcycle parked just outside so we can make a quick getaway. A bear-ricade. Oh yeah. I was bear-n ready. Nope. Go vegan! It's going down, Bongo! What is that, though? For real? (laughter) What's it do? That's exactly how it was presented to us. What are you going to blow up? No, then we'll blow up inside. Okay! Well, what's our choice? What are you asking us to do? Just leave? There's a map! Guys, we need to be using this time to come up with more puns. There's Smokey, there's Yogi, come on, guys! Wait a second. You're gonna have to shoot balls in his mouth. Oh, you're going to block it?! (laughter) You shot Marisha! How many does he have to get in? Oh wait, those are hits? Wait, I got one more bullet. Should I try it? It says it has the power of ten bullets, but it will destroy the gun. Do I have to get it in the mouth, or just hit it? Oh. I flashback to when I was a child in Szechuan, China. My father said to me, "Run, Peddy, run. The hunters have come." I heard in the distance firing sounds, because the Chinese invented guns long before anyone else did. I heard gunfire and I ran and ran, and that's the last time I saw my family, and that was the last time I ever saw a gun. Now, it will be my salvation. You're going to stay? Potions. What?! Get on the bike, guys! Jump on the bike! Let her rip! (motorcycle imitations) Do I need to roll to escape the fire? I failed! What happened to Trinket?! We're going back into the tunnel? We've got to get him, guys. I don't have a vehicle, jump on my back! Do I get advantage because I'm a driver? Success! Use your strength, Las Vegas! Guys? Let's get the hell out of here. What do you mean? What honey? Why? Any bamboo? I'll take it. He committed bearikiri. (laughter) Marisha Ray! The Godfather voice! Oh in the movie? Don LaFontaine was a voice over guy. No, I just wanted a name! I don't even know that! Maybe the graphic will come up right now.
