(shouting) What the fuck is going on?! What-- Max?! Are you in my seat?! Go away! Go! What the fuck is happening?! Travis, you emailed me. You said we were starting at 715 tonight. Did you lie to me? And you thought no one could tell the difference between me and Max? I'm Sam! I'm offended at this, guys. My spots are not controversial in any way. Yes, I do. I have it on my phone. It might have. Yes. Fine. (clears throat) It's me, Sam Riegel, the wackiest guy in D&D, telling you to head on over to D&D Beyond, where their new content is like anti-gravity; it's impossible to put down. On D&D Beyond, my username is "benefits." That way, if you add me to your party, it'll say we're friends with benefits. No, seriously though, my username is "forrestgump," and my password is "1forrest1." Did you write this? Well, wakka wakka wakka! Thanks, D&D Beyond, this was wacky Sam Riegel saying, "Go Dallas?!" Fuck you! Back to you, Matt. (laughter) I'm Sam. You're wearing sleeves. Us? We have a show again. One a year. Yes, the Pablove Foundation raises money to battle childhood cancer, and we're supporting Blair Herter on his ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles. We've raised over $64,000, maybe more by now. I haven't checked in a little while. We're trying to get to $100,000, and if we do, we will get to unlock me doing a Fireside Chat. I will do anything for $100,000. (laughing) That's fine. That still counts. We've already unlocked a one-shot that we'll be announcing more details about later, and we've also supported one whole grant that will be donated to a scientist who will do cutting-edge research. So thank you. Keep giving! We're doing a one-shot of Crash Pandas. I'll be running the game with some of the people at this very table, and it's going to be released on the 28th of September. I think? 21st of September! It's live on the 21st of September! I've got to write this thing. No! That looks crazy. Ask him what he wants. Sure. He's so good! That was good! It's a very good skill, you're quite talented. Really. Junior. Did he slip into it? Judging by your physique though you must be quite excellent on the water. I'm sure you're an asset to any vessel. Now that I've buttered you up-- how about-- have you ever heard of Marius LePual? Oh! Well as one green to another, we were just told that he might be around and he has some information that we were looking for. We are actually trying to deliver him a bit of correspondence. Oh that will go over great. Ooh! Minus three... oh no. Persuasion is at zero? How did that happen? Anyway it's 13. Oh I'm proficient at persuasion. Wow, who knew? You're roommates with Marius? Oh. (exaggerated Cajun accent) We'll be very careful. We guarantee. (laughter) There's the white-haired lady. The thick elf, yeah. Yeah. To refresh everyone else's memory, because my memory is sound, we're looking for a way to get down into the underbelly of the city, right? Oh yeah, that's right. We got to find out some info. Use those blue dice, those blue dice! I touched them all. 200 gold. Cadmus. Cue heavy metal music! I'll run over and give her a big hug on her knees! We're here for Fjord and also for you. No, she has to tell us. Where're you going now? You just got here. We haven't even said hello! This is Yasha. You can't afford-- She's going to Marquet. Is that where you're going? That will be difficult to find. She might be under a spell or something, a hypnosis spell. Hit her. Snap her out of it. Maybe we've been there. The moist guy. Ooh, are you super-goth Santa or something? Or maybe it's the ball thing, the dodeca. Maybe it brings us all together. Maybe it's special in some way? He does this a lot, Yasha. Go with it! Open up, and he'll read into your inner thoughts. That's his power. You probably do, but you just don't remember them. You can sleep with crystals to have a more vivid experience when you dream. Tonight, when it looks like you're really fast asleep, I'll wake you up and ask you what you're thinking about! Great. Yet? To Yasha? She's right next to you. Everyone, please. Yasha has to catch an express bus out of here, so we should probably get to ass-kicking. Yeah, the magical messages. They should have arrived. That doesn't make any sense, unless if you were under someone's spell? Well, that's four extra words. Stay on task, Widogast! (laughter) We have asked everyone in this bar about everyone else in this town except for Al Gore. I don't think that we have, no. We have not. The tower. We've asked about Sabian. We've asked about Marquet. We've asked about the Marius guy. We need to ask why we came here. All right. I take a big swig of booze, stand up on the table, take off my mask. (shouting) Everyone in the Wayfarer's Cove! You're surrounded by a band of goblins! They're everywhere! And they'll come in here unless you tell me the location of Algar! Tell me now! And I kick over a chair. Two kicks. There's goblins everywhere! They're banging at the windows! You might know him as Mr. Dyomin? That was, of course, a scene from the one-act play that you can see later tonight. The Marquis Demesne. To talk to-- First question to Marius how do you pronounce your last name? How? MARISHA and Why don't we take a rowboat? And I'll just stay above the surface and when you guys are ready, tug and I'll pull you up. Yasha will stay with me. I don't understand. We're just going to go out into the harbor and start swimming blindly looking for an underwater gate? Why don't we send someone first, or at least ask around before we just start swimming? Let's go! I weigh less than Yasha's sword. So if you want to save some weight-- Oh, but I would have to take it off. I'll stay on the shore, it's fine. You are. I don't think it changes your weight. Yeah, seem. How is Jester going to trail behind? Because her dad has sweaty palms? They are wrong. It's horrifying! There's monsters in it, you can't see down below, it can snuff you out in a few moments. Oh no! It's not worth it, let's go! What was it that got you? That's longer than us! How did you know we were coming? Are you sure about that? A guy who works at the docks in the harbor where this thing is wouldn't know the location of everything under the water? That would have worked if someone had been a little snappier with the Thaumaturgy. Insecurity check. As we're untying the boat-- Right? It's tied up? As we're untying the boat, I'm going to hide behind a pillar. That's a two. Plus ten. Oh yeah, I was just checking the rigging. Great. I'm coming. All right. 40 feet down, 60 feet into the tunnel, and then up, still underwater. Doesn't work underwater. No! It's every lovely we should just stay here all day. I'll gently tap you twice. I think that's a great idea. The strongs. What? No! I had a lot of seagulls yesterday for dinner, I'm very full still. I will not eat your weasel. Too bony. Too bony. Promise. I promise I will not eat your weasel today. Ooh. Amazing! Our swim speed is half? Are they alive? Oh! Oh, because you can see. No, don't worry, I'll take it back to the shore for us in stealth. Sure! I'll go to the warehouse and try to break in. I don't like water. Mostly we don't. We don't live near the ocean. It's not-- I don't. (sigh) Oh, shit. Three. Yes, well, you do know best Caleb. All right, this sounds like a good idea. Sure-- are you a good swimmer? All right? I'm going to take a big swig of whiskey and climb on Beau's back. (sigh) All right dolphin lady, ride me. (laughter) All right mermaid, scale me down. (breathing heavily) (squealing) (still squealing) I'm holding the weasel! That's a little cocked. (nervous laughter) Wow, that was invigorating. I don't know. You didn't have me look after Nugget. Are we all here? Caleb, are you here? I just had a feeling overcome me, that I was-- I've never done anything like that before. It's not real, is it? (laughing) I'll just start drinking. Frumpkin! What is going on? They are impervious to throwing star damage. This is so cool! Yeah, but not with a map on it. That's amazing! I'm Mr. Darksearchman. (laughing) You already rolled. That's even better. No, no. You got 19. Yeah. Ten. Oh, Ashley's back. Ten. Matt, is it pitch dark in here? Oh no. I see the damage done to my lovely friends, and seeing as I care about Caleb slightly more, I will attack the one that hit-- no offense-- I will attack the one that hit Caleb with a shot of a Tinkertop Blaster, whatever it's called. All right, so that's 20-something to hit. He's engaged with firbolg over here, right? That's four, four, four, so plus yikes five is-- Thank you. (laughing) That. I will use my bonus action to... Well, I'll use my movement to sort of tuck back into the hallway there. Yeah, if I can, and then I'll bonus action to hide. Press myself up against a wall or something. That's fine. All right. Not great. 18. Wait is this... stealth? 18. I was looking for the hide ability. Have I been drunk at this point? I don't know, am I? Okay, so I'm okay. Okay, good. Yes! I told you water was terrible! Matt, I've been rolling the wrong number of die every time. I've been rolling 3d6, but it should've been four. So, I got an extra one point of damage. Ooh, Tracy! We know things. Amazing. Yeah! Booming dick energy! (laughter) H2 oh, no! (laughter) D&D Beyond is the greatest. Science. Math. Acid. I will fire my arrow thing at the creature, striking it with 20 something! 20 things. Is it engaged in something? Oh. I did. It's still terrible. 17 again. I hate water! (panting heavily) Big deal! Water is terrible. It tried to kill us! It actively wants to kill us! Are you okay? Do you need healing? Because Caduceus can heal you. Oh, sorry! Here you are. Caduceus, you might want that. Nott's in the back. Little Beau. I'm right next to him. You got your weasel on your back? Jester, you're starting to smell like Caleb. Wet dog and wet weasel. All over your neck. Your knee smells bad. The water can fly now. I can walk on water. 38. Whispers! Tickets are still on sale, orchestra seats, very few left. Who knows what will happen at the live show? Wait, who has a necklace? Algar? You don't want to fight this guy? Are you Taliesin right now? Matt's gone, I guess. Oh, he's back! That's real water. And colored lights! Dungeons & Dragons just broke! He's the tall one? Sure. I mean, yeah. I was stealthing so hard, I'm playing with the McElroys right now. Matt! Come on. Let's get some crew people. 19. Say all those again. Did you go already? Did you say yours? Ah! I'm up first? I'm so scared! There's water, water everywhere and all of it wants to kill me. I will scramble ahead and-- Oh, I'm so far away. I'll scramble ahead and to the left, near where the octopus is. Am I within 30 feet of those big watery things? Then I will-- No fucking way. I will just use my bonus action to dash and go on the other side of that pillar. I guess a little closer, but keeping the pillar between me and all baddies, if possible. Yeah. And hold my action until someone is engaged. Do I have to aim at someone? A crossbow bolt. Until someone is-- they're engaged with someone of my friends. Actually, you know what? I'm sorry, Matt. Can I undo? Can I use my action to just cast Mage Hand? Okay. I'm going to put it up near Algar. Wait, where's the necklace? Is it on Algar or is it-- I'll put it near the genie guy for now, because that's all I've seen. Matt is repairing an aquarium during our game tonight. The water's moving. The fish are getting air. You know why I love this, guys? I love this because it's kind of like an aerator. Science! Slick and moist. You have to accept that. T-shirts are bullshit. Yeah Algar, don't mess with the Ruby. We won! Ah! Oh no! That means I'm going to slam into you. Those are some big fellas. I'm spelling it "Zh". Where he's from, these are bracelets, and these are necklaces. Oh no, Fjord. Ten bucks you get defenestrated. Ooh! Thunder Step? What's Thunder Step? It's not Thunder Wave? Whoa! Oh no. Douche. Oh no, he's escaping. You can't see Algar. Oh god. How can I control the Mage Hand with a bonus action? Can I move it and grab with it, or just grab with it? It's very vague. It says, "You can control the hand." But I don't know if that means-- Okay. So who has the necklace? Zsa Zsa? Zsundie? I can't see Algar, but Zsundie is the-- He's wearing a necklace? I will bonus action try to steal his necklace. Arcana check? 19. I don't get sleight of hand or anything? 19. I give him a purple nurple. (laughter) Okay, I'll fire. That is a 17, I believe. 17, plus I'll use Fury of the Small to add another six, that's 23! (singing) Like a rogue! Have any of you heard of Marius LePual? (laughter) Don't you have a feat now? Fanatical fanatic? No, not a good try, you failed. Oh no! Come on, Caduce. That seems nice. It's like a Snuggie. What do you mean, you don't know? He just did the math. No! Water! Oh my God this is happening again! Wait, what? You ever done this before? Oh boy. Oh boy. He just was mean. He's being waterboarded. It's all up to you. Wow! Hey! He won't even know why he was dead, though. We didn't even to tell him it was from the Ruby of the Sea. Oh. Sure, I'd just like to point out that your mom said, "This guy's been bothering me a little," and we blew him up, and attacked him with tentacles. "He's just been a little annoying." I don't know what's going on with Caleb so I will move over toward Yasha. Check in on my boy. Ahh! (laughter) He's face down in the water. Nope, can't trust you. I will just burn all my actions to do it myself. Am I within 30 feet of Caleb? No, back where I was with Yasha am I within 30 feet of him? Okay I'll get another ten feet closer. I will use my Mage Hand to take a healing potion out of my hand and shoot it 30 feet towards him. I will cast it again using an action, next to me. Grab my potion and take it. And then I will use my bonus action to use my Mage Hand to pour it into his gullet. Oh shit. I roll heal, what do I roll? 2d4. Seven. That's it. Get him Jester! Come on Yash. Even though you're raging? I'm glad I saved Caleb. Yeah, but they're alive. That's a lot! You could freeze it. Okay. That was, I wouldn't say hellish. Oh no. This is rough. Fjord just went to a dark place But you love her. Caducey, do something. (whispering) Your animals are with you. (whispering) Your animals can't breathe. Yes! Heavy metal when Yasha talks! Action Park! (laughter) Are we fighting this thing? Wa-pang! (gasps) Oh boy. We're not going to-- are we going to fight this thing? My plan is to not fight this thing! Where am I? I'm going to move that way again, past over here. Around Yasha. I will yell to-- what is it, Szundi? Szundie? Junji? I will yell to Szundie, we didn't want to hurt you! We respect and fear water! Look, my feet won't even sink into it, I fear it so much! I bow before you! Yeah! 11! (laughter) Bonus action hide! Bonus action hide! With advantage. 22. (singsong) Szundie, Szundie, Szundie. No! Oh, no. (coos) Ashley, you coming back next week? Was she ever there, guys?
