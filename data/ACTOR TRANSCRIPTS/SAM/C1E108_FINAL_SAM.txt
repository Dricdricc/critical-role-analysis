What's up, guys? You know, near things. Can't really see too well, so put me where-- Let's see. I was at the door when we opened it and then I was beautiful. And now I'm not as beautiful. So put me near the door. 12. Can I cast Cutting Words, or can I use Cutting Words? I don't know if it's going to do anything, but sure. Only by a little. I want him to miss, right? Wait, are you pointing to me? Oh! I have this dice. It's the first time I've ever used it. It has poop on it; someone sent me poop dice, and I think I just rolled a natural 20 because I rolled the poop. The other side is a skull. Is poop 20 or is poop one? 19, 13, and seven. I'm on vacation, so nothing's going to be amazing. Is the sword still on the ground? Is it near me? Okay, I will cast Bigby's Hand! And I will pick up the sword and I will use it to hit not the guy whose sword it was, but the guy closest to me. Okay. Doesn't matter. I want the guy who hit me. It can move 60 feet. I got an 18. Plus something; I don't know. Oh, plus 11. Yeah, that's huge. Is this a sword attack, or is this Bigby's Hand's clenched fist attack? That's cool. Okay, I love you, and thank you. So I roll 4d8. Cool. Oh wait, wrong one. 4d8, 17 plus 12, 29. Oh! Sorry, thank you. Then it's 17 plus seven. Oh, I get a bonus. I will inspire Keyleth. I guess. Not that she needs any help; she's so fricking powerful, but I will inspire Keyleth by singing (singing) Your Minxie brings all the boys to the yard and they're like, it's better than yours, damn right, it's better than yours, you can teach them, but you'd have to "chorge?" (speaking) I don't know. I'm close to a guy who's going to hit me if I move, right? Then I will move dead center on the board. I will Cutting Words that. Oh. I'm going to quote from some old TV show and say you are a monstrous mechanised misguided moron! That's it. Correct, Taliesin Jaffe! Oh shit, I only rolled a three. May I assist by holding the bodies with Bigby's Hand while you pull the heads? Hey, you're inspired. Wait, what? So you want me to heat the platinum and then shove into the guy's face? What? This is bullshit. I'm going to stand there, hands on hips. That's the only time Marisha has ever said those words. (laughter) Hope your mom's watching. I will lag behind Grog. Oh, what if we show him one of our little beans? Maybe you have to show him how good a blacksmith you are to earn the privilege. I can certainly try. This is arcana? It's a 21. Who forged here before? What god? Well, should we show our god shit? Did we do that yet? It smells of coffee. 12. What does that do? Is it an automatic hit, or is it something I can do Cutting Words on? Well, I will Cutting Words it for my attack. No, he's going to hit me no matter what. Who's in the path? It will hit, but I will do my Cutting Words. Okay, a d12. I rolled a nine. I will quote Dr. Smith again and I will yell at him you are a tiresome, tin-plated, tintinnabulation. Me? Oh Jesus. This thing's big and scary. Yeah! Of course it is! I'm not dumb. Super intimidating! So how far is he from me? Okay, not knowing what to do, I will (raspberry). I'm looking at my spells; I've got nothing. I will blast him with a Lightning Bolt, a level three Lightning Bolt. You know what, I'll do level four, so 9d6, I suppose. 22. So it's 34 points of damage. Jesus. I'm within melee range of him, so if I move I will get hit, yes? Okay. Grog, you're okay, right? What? I don't know what to do about you, I'm sorry! I'll inspire you, I guess, right? Because you don't need health? (laughs) Sorry! All right, I'll inspire him, I suppose. Sorry, Grog. Oh, sorry. I will pick up my flute and I will sing (singing) You like it when my flute goes, baby make your booty glow, Scanlan know you want to show my song, song, song, song, song. Yeah, I'm going to stay where I am. You can do that? Loin-grab. He's trying to kill the cricket. Oh, yeah, of course. Oh yeah, that's right. Okay, that's terrible. So I've already rolled a 13, plus a d4. This is not going to go well, is it? d4 is another one. That's 14. What? LIAM and This is not a check; this is a save. I've only used two. Oh, Cutting Words counts? Then I've used four so far, and I have two more to go. All right, bye guys. 14. Yeah. Sure, sure. But with vibrato. I guess, yeah, probably. (laughs) I will, I guess, save my life and Dimension Door out of there. Yes, please. I have no other options. Oh, I'm next to the edge? Oh. Well, I'll try that first with my movement, I guess, right? Oh boy. I wasn't expecting to attack this turn. I'll do the lightning again because it seemed to have some damage. No, you know what? We've got to block his sword, right? Shit. I will Bigby's Hand and try to grapple his sword. Yes. I don't know if that's going to work at all. I guess. This is supposed to be against a creature, not against an item. It's a 19. 19. Plus three, so that's 22. I will use a bonus action to level two Healing Word myself. I will sing, (singing) I'm freaked out by the shape of me! I'm burned up and nobody can see. So you know what I'll do to thee? Give some health to my body. (vocalizing) (laughter) You have inspiration. That was with disadvantage? MATT and Damn. Am I still holding on to his sword? That hits. I made a 23. The first one was that poop thing again. Second one, I only rolled a seven, so I'm sure this is not going to add up to something good. What am I adding to this, Matt? Okay, I'm still not going to hit 22. This is a check, though, so I could inspire myself, maybe? Okay, then it can max out at 20. Oh! Okay, well then I will roll my d4 and see if I can hit it. I only rolled a three, not a four. (groaning) Who's up? I will cast another Lightning Bolt at level six this time, which is 11d6. Okay. 11d6, yes. Okay. That's only 42. How far am I from the thing? I will not move. I was never blind. But me hitting it doesn't un-blind someone else, does it? Oh, shit. Okay, I'll Healing Word myself again, I guess. What is it? 2d4 plus six. Well, there seems to be some confusion about that question. I have it at 62, but the overlay has me at 44, so I don't know. That hits. I will reduce that with Cutting Words. d12. Six. What was the damage? I don't think you said. You rolled a 20-something to hit, but I don't think you said damage. I'm unconscious. But I have some sort of Death Ward on me. This overlay thing's pretty cool. Can we have a hologram version of that in front of us all the time? That we can see, I mean. Thank you. I rolled that poop thing again. Wait, do I get advantage? No, I don't know. I could do one if we really need it. What's wrong with Grog? He can't do it? Should I Bigby the other? All right. I'll have to do it at level seven. 21. Oh wait. Is this an ability check? I'm exhausted. Oh, do you want me to inspire you or anything? Do you all need anything? I've got a bead. Do you want me to inspire you? TRAVIS and All right, I will-- I go up to Grog and I tell him Grog, I'm going to tell you some words of wisdom that I learned from a book once. A wise man said, "The man who hast smelted verily didst also "dealt it." Inspiration time? Yes, I do. I will sing to him. (singing) Pour some platinum on thee and get it on an anvil. Pour some platinum on thee when you need a trammel! You'd have to roll a 12? Sure. Yeah, I can inspire one more time. Shall I inspire him? Sure. Yeah, I'll inspire him again. I will give him every inch of myself. One by one by one, yeah. Yes, you should. Sure. I can inspire him. Teeny hammer? Yes, sure. I'll give you some. I will sing to you. I will sing (singing) bang bang, Percy's ball-peen hammer goes down, upon the ground! Bang bang, Percy's ball-peen hammer makes a really, really big sound. (vocalizing) I've used five, and I think I get six. All right. I will inspire you with some bullshit. Yeah, but he's got one more shot at this. I will sing one more song to inspire you. I'll sing (singing) Here's a little song I wrote! It's filled with inspiration note for note. Don't fuck up! Or I'll kill you! (laughter) I saved one level eight spell for such a thing.
