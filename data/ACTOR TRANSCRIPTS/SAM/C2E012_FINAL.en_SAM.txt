Here to talk to you about D&D Beyond is a returning friend of the show. (laughter) Bonzai, wave hogs and hog-ettes, it's Brody Slater, king of the kick-flip, jamming about the froobs at D&D Beyond. You all know I love letting my leash out on maxed shore breaks at Steamer Lane. Real bang! When I'm not flashing the shaka at some quimby on a softboard, I'm chillaxing with my buds with some gnarly roleplaying games. Now, I'm partial to Dead Earth, Empire of Satanis, and F.A.T.A.L.-- slotted!-- but my broheims are hooked on fifth edition, which means I get stoked for D&D Beyond. If there's one thing Brody Slater loves more than shacked eskimo rolls, it's diligent organization. Right now, you can go to D&D Beyond's Facebook page and leave a comment on their top (stammers) pinned post, telling them your favorite moment for episode 11 of Critical Role to be entered to win a legendary bundle. Far out! So don't be a Benny Poser, head on over to D&D Beyond and enter now. Hang 11! (cheering and clapping) I don't even know what that is, I looked it up. Fan favorite. And by fan, I mean me. (laughter) I'm a fan of my own character. Is it? Even better. A whole day? (groans) Maybe on the job board at that place. I don't know! On the spot? How fast a forger are you? Here, let's test you. I'm going to write down, (stammering) "Oh, what a goose I am." Copy my handwriting. It's pretty good. (laughter) Me? Okay. Will I be in there alone? I’m drinking. I always listen to Caleb, he's my right-hand man. Poutine. You're proficient in mail fraud. Well, if she’s issued any sort of royal, official things, yeah, there should be some sort of record. We're leaving a bag of gold in a trash receptacle? Extremely. Like you'd be a fan? Step one is find documents. This is the most exciting thing we’ve ever done. Oh! So find addresses and documents! Ooh! Cue the music. I do. I saw their home? He lived-- All of us? One thing at a time. All of us? All right, let's go. Who wants to go knocky-knocky? No, I just saw a window and a door. Right? In disguise or as is? (pigeon cooing) (pigeon cooing) What are we signaling for? Okay. A flock of pigeons come down. (pigeon cooing) (as pigeons) High-Richter! Ren Sutan is his name? We blew it. (as pigeon) High-Richter! How did it go? We got some good information, we got Sutan's address and Ren's address. Oh my god! So you're saying that we could use other handwriting as well, and it wouldn't be out of the ordinary, as long as it beared the signature and seal of said place? Ooh, a letterhead. Constellation Bridge. Constellation Bridge. So we're going there with the express purpose of--? That's in the Tri-Spire. So we need to go through the sewers to get there. What are we looking for at Ren's? Okay, from his papa. Okay. I don't think anyone can make it through the gates, except for you. Will you be able to get in? We'll sneak on in through the sewers? They're talking about going straight in through the gate because they're, you know, respectable. At the Leaky-- Monk shit. Where was that? Oh I'm not there. (laughter) It's not him, it's a pigeon. There's a metagaming pigeon in this. (laughter) You're probably more familiar with silk bindings. Got it. You want to let them go off on their own? They have to break in somewhere, they're going to be-- I mean, I'm with you Caleb. If you don't want to go then let's go back to the Leaky Tap. We don't have to go, I don't care. It sounds scary to me. That's a good idea. We found him. Go. Go away! Go. Go away! Shoo! Go away! 14. Oh, sorry. I mean, we've got Mollymauk with us. Why don't you just do the same thing to him? I don't appreciate this. At all. I feel like I'm being singled out because I'm a woman. (laughter) If there is an office. Okay. Look like you're just-- Cough and stuff? Oh, I've got it, I've got it. Faster. What if Caleb burns all of your clothing and you go in as a burn victim? Yes. Yes. We do Mother's Love. Yes, good idea. Did you add your intelligence bonus? Oh, great. How will we know when to go? Go, go, go, go! Like Noah through the ark! (baby wails) Oh, no, me? That's a negative one. (shriek) Oh, God, you're using it to attack? You can do that? Your modifier's right there. 21. What are we doing in here? We have to go back to the office! We could -- You're right. Maybe we should just leave. Molly and Fjord will be fine, we'll just leave. We have some-- We could-- I'm looking. What do we got? We could do Enemy of My Enemy? (stammering) You could set the place on fire. You could-- I don't know what to do! Shh! Okay, let's go! We're going to run out the door. Wait, out of the hospital or just out of the room? Just out of the room. We got to go! No. Is this the doctor that we saw before? (hisses) Intimidation? Negative three?! How is that possible? 13. I’m going to scamper towards the office if I can, as fast as I can. Oh god. Nine? They got me. They got me, guys. Oh no. This couldn’t have gone better. Enemy of My Enemy now? Are you fast? All right, fine. I’m not leaving you. I’m much faster than you. We’re going to start to run. 15 from me. Anything from his dad? He’s heavily guarded. There was no way to get close enough. We almost had to kill an orderly. It’s very embarrassing. It was a good dry run for our real heist that we’re going to be doing in a day. So we’re working out the kinks… Well, don’t worry about that because they definitely saw our real faces. Oh yes, you’re right. They only saw my real face, so maybe that’s okay. No, no. Do you need me to write something? I could do that-- We are so much better than the other people at planning like this. (laughter) In block letters? Can’t be traced to anyone? That sort of thing? Make it look like evil calligraphy. Ooh yeah! A check? Traceable! Sounds official. No, no! Take out the part where you say, “Do you like me? If so, check this box.” (laughter) What? Scroll it! Because we’re going to-- Just shoot the dog with an arrow and kill it. Show the dog your dick. All right. Sure. I need a few papers. I would like to talk to Caleb. (clears throat) Oh, Caleb? Nott here. I have a favor to ask of you. I absconded with some items recently, and I wanted you to take a look at them with your keen eye. It was not-- I didn’t break in anywhere-- I mean, we did, but it was cool because other people were with me. It’s when we went down into the basement to scout around for other entrances into the bottom of the Leaky Tap. I found a skeleton that had these bracelets on her? Him? They? Yeah, I don't know. I didn't really have time to look at it. A very old dead person. Could be ancient. I didn't think about that, but yes. I don't think it's haunted or anything. It just seemed like someone-- it was stuffed way in the corner behind some boxes like someone wanted to-- I didn't-- I mean-- I'm really just interested in these. (laughter) These are just bracelets that I found. I was wondering if you could use your magic skills. No, but they're shiny and nice. Ooh. Maybe I could. Are they big? All right. Okay. I understand. Well, we can go back and I can show you, if you'd like, but it didn't seem like-- How do you do that? Where you look at something and you just see what it is? It's so cool! It's very impressive. Really? I don't know. You know so many spells and so many things. You're very strong. I'm continually impressed by you, I must say. How strong would you say you are? On a scale of one to 20? Is that the way you'll get even stronger? Through study and books? Would magical items help further your abilities or blessings? All right. Oh, I'm fine, I'm just fascinated by all things wizard and I want you to succeed, that's all. I have great faith in you, I know you'll do great things, and I just want to help you get there. Sure. Yes. Anything, anything to help the cause. Okay. Sounds good. Maybe two strings. What if you take a letter and just sign it “Knights of Requital” and rip off the rest, so who knows what it was, it's just from them. She doesn't like red doors, she doesn't like the Knights of Requital. Yes. I did. My handwriting is not as good. It feels nice to participate in a democracy like this. One monk, one vote. (laughter) Yes. Don't worry about that. I'll eat everything we leave behind. Which is our first house that we're attacking? And we know that there's a guard and a dog out there. So you guys need to distract the guard. And the sausage. I'll drink instead. Can't we just go to the sewers? The gate? It seems like they're not looking right now. No, they're not looking, we can just go. Natural one. Plus eight. Ooh! It’s the same guy, it's the same guy! What guy? I cast Message a few times. We’re here. Where are you? Where have you been? What’s Ulog’s job in this? Whispers! Whispers! D&D Beyond! Far Cry 5! It’s five better than Far Cry 0. Yes. Montana. No, I don’t think so. More of a spring… 13. Must be getting tired. We can get in through the gate and then we get to the tree or we’re going to go straight into the cellar? We worry about that later? That’s very risky now because what if the guards says “I don’t know you,” you know? Then the plan never starts. If we do that at the end, at least we have a fighting chance. Okay. You can cough or something. I will signal you when we are grapple throwing. Ooh, that's good. I rolled an 18. Watch my nails. Ooh. I thought you were a monk of some sort. You're all legs and no arms. What is this? Why do--? All right. Yeah, are you? I don't know. I feel like I'm more precise than you. But, no, you're strong. You go for it. I don't-- Parchment, boulder, shears? Yes, on three. One. Two. Three! Okay, you're throwing it. Ooh, strength. It's not staying on? Reel it back in. Reel it back in! Give me that. Give me that! (squeaks) Yes. Natural one. (laughter) We've lost our grapple. Oh boy. Try! You said strength. I threw it as hard as I could throw it. Thunder! Triple dump! Taliesin did a triple dump earlier. It won't be a one. She's amazing. Sure. Oh wait, do we have to cast-- Do we have to have a-- Distraction! Oh, we're going to shimmy across. Because what if the guard looks up and sees us? So we do that now! Now! No, we're going through the roof now, I thought. No? There could be. Look around for a door on the roof! Rich people. Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's shimmy across. Make the distraction now. No we didn't! Go. Sausage cat! Okay, I take out my little piece of wire and I whisper the incantation and do the motions. Hey, Fjord, Jester wants to know Did we look cool? You can respond to this message. (laughter) He said, "Did they go already?" (laughter) I'm going to go down the chimney. What? I have a shortsword. I don't like to lend my items out. Let's go down the chimney. At least I can go down there and look to see if it's possible. In the haversack! Yes. I pull out my thing, and I do my thing. We're going in, to the house. You can respond to this message. They're dead. Are there any other doors in this crawl space that lead into the main? Natural 20. Do you want to draw a mustache on it, or something? A dick butt? Traps? Sorry. I going to take a big drink. I'm going to look for traps. 20. 20. Ulog, you didn't find anything. I found a trap. Necromancy. Edubation. Let's jump over this little hump. Let's go! Jump over that little hump. Wait, what if-- we are up shit's creek. So we need Schmidt's creek. What if you have Schmidt do something? Can Schmidt go do something? I told him to do that, I sort of-- He goes, "Watch and learn, little one." Is he mansplaining to me? We're making progress! You can respond to this message. We're making progress! (laughter) Me? Okay. I'm gonna look for traps. Eight, plus five. 13. Oh! It's a door? That's trapped? We let Ulog do it! I'm going to try to disarm it. Do I see the triggering mechanism? Yes, 16. These are your tools, Beau! I feel so alive! Ooh, an invisible balcony. The rug? Okay. Did you see the lock I just-- 19. Traps. We should not step on it. Do we have anything that can negate the magic or-- Can Schmidt stand on the carpet? Oh! I can move it with my Mage Hand or something, or peel it back with my mage hand. Oh, shit! Shut up, Ulog! Fuck you, I know what I'm doing. You want me to move the carpet? It was transmutation. I'm going to cast Message. We are the fucking best! You can respond to this message! (laughter) I cast Mage Hand and slowly peel back a corner of the carpet. Yeah, Holly. (laughter) Oh no! It gets a surprise round. That hits. 24. A VS spell is verbal. Can I talk? Okay. I will touch it with Shocking Grasp, cast Shocking Grasp on it. It's touch, to hit plus five. So I have to roll. 13 plus five. 18! Okay. One point of damage. However, it can't take reactions until its next turn. Does it let me go? I can't move away from it? Oh shit. Well, poo. Damn! I can't hear you. And jump! (screaming) I'm hurting! You can reply to this message! I'm unconscious. Uh-huh. What does that mean? (muffled screaming) From one healing potion? We can't hurt Beau! I will go and try to wrestle the-- Two. (screaming) Turn it off? He's doing sneak attack damage to the carpet, which translates to you. Oh, okay. Sure, I'll swing a shortsword at it. 21 to hit. Yeah, sure. If I'm going to hit it, I'm going to hit it. (counting) 15. Oh, she's out. Me? What about Jes? Oh, that was a reaction. Well, I guess I see how bad the rug is doing and I will swing that shortsword again. Why not? It's a 15. You said it was hanging by a thread, right? Maybe not sneak attack damage. Ooh, ten points? (laughter) Ah! What have I done?! Heal her! I'm going to cast Message. Remember the hospital? That. You can reply to this message. (laughter) We'll fix it later. I'll check the thing on the ground while Ulog checks the thing on the mantelpiece or wherever it is. What am I checking? 14 on the thing on the floor. 15 plus thieves' tools. Oh, shit. Ten. The chest is trapped. How is she going to get back in to the-- Because all the checks tonight have been so good. Short rest? Can we use hit dice? Psst, Marisha, how do you tell how many hit dice you have? It is? How are we getting into this house? Yeah. We found out that there's a door. But that doesn't give us a way in. But there's no trees! We need to take them out and go through the front door. You? Wait, before you do this, why don't we go to the festival and see what she looks like? A white cloak? I'm going to go around and see if there's any other entrances, or if there's any other guards around the perimeter. Okay, seven. (squeals) 17. This is it. Thank god. Much better. Oh, no. Sorry. Beau's got all the persuasion. I'm going to try to open the back door. Okay, I will unlock it. Not so good. Nine. Ulog! Ulog, I need your help. Does he come around the back of me? The pleasure was all mine. At a time like this? Want to send Frumpkin in? Great. Let's go. (chanting) Checking for traps. It's One Direction. I think you have one at your house. In your kitchen? I cast Message upstairs blindly, not knowing where they are, saying we're in the house, we're coming up to help you. You can, of course, reply to this message. They're upstairs! Let's go! Ulog, they're not upstairs. Oh, shit. Everyone thinks that Matt is managing three storylines right now, but there's actually a fourth that we don't even know about. Yeah, grope that desk. Yes, look at you! (whispers) Tusk Love! Oh. Should I open the little box again? Schmidt! Suspense! Ooh! (taps feet rapidly) Take it! Take it! Do they open, or are they picture windows? Wow. What does it say? I pull out my hand crossbow and I point it at Fjord. Fjord, put that fucking thing down! (whispers) It was a suicide! What is going on?! Alone upstairs, I pick up the scrolls and put them in my pocket. I'm going to open the gable windows, if they open, and jump out them. I jump out the windows and scatter as far as I can. Ooh, acrobatics, not great. Ten. Stealth, 16. 16. What's going on? Did we do this?! It's Molly, isn't it? Molly did it! 19. Male or female? We need to get far away from here. And Ulog too. I think I was sort of mean to him. What's a Crick? I thought that was a story. I should've been more edubated. What?! The Crick--
