Oh, shit! This is so awkward. Is this how I was fired from the show? Good luck. I think you're going to do great. These guys will take care of you. And then I come here. You're not, you're the same. Where am I supposed to sit?! Right here? Is that true? I don't know. Are we scooting over? This is the most awkward. I love it. No, no, I've got the half-table at the end here. It's great. Sorry, we're ready. This shirt, right here? I have it! Oh, sorry. Don't worry, I've already been emasculated. (laughter) Oh, is that true? I'm sitting on half a chair. No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine, Christopher. First roll. (clears throat) I'm pretty good. Ah, no. No, and I don't think I could learn. What could happen? 14. (laughter) With the plus ten. Tra-la-la-la-la. I'm trying to do that thing that the Ashari just did. Oh, yes. Mm-hm. Oh, disadvantage, because I'm exhausted. Okay. 14. (whispering) I think it saw Grog. Should we engage or keep going? No, no, don't kill him, he's precious. Who are you? Who are you? But these are zombies, these are undead, these are creatures of evil! Oh. They're not human. This can't be the first time this has happened. Can you make them vests or something that says 'service'? No, it's not. This volcano-- do you live near here? This volcano really takes the piss out of you. What are you doing on top of a volcano? They're magical candles? Well, we feel dreadful about killing one of your pets. Perhaps we can purchase a candle off of you to make amends. Would you like a body to reanimate or something? I don't know. Are we? We're Vox Machina, a traveling band of adventurers led by me, Scanlan Shorthalt, and these are my compatriots. We're on a very important mission to get-- what are we doing? We have to break something big and scary. Scanlan Shorthalt. I'm a musician. But these people, they can't really hold a tune so much. Your undead pets, are they going to try and eat our brains or anything? Who was the one that we killed? Oh, that's very beautiful. Can you fight and stuff in case shit goes down? All taken. What happened to your tail? Okay, I won't. Seen some shit. That was easy. Gern, is that one of yours? That's you, Gern. Gern. Yep! Wait, are you exhausted? There's a third team? You don't know. Won't that kill your friend? That's fair. That's fair. You don't have to demean him as he goes. For Fatty! Is that Gern? So these are fire elementals, yes? 22. Do I see that big thing in the back? Okay. And the thing next to Fatty Arbuckle is also a baddie, yeah? They're all baddies? All right. I'm going to take 15 feet, step to my right to put me in a straight line with the guy next to Fatty and the big guy behind him. And then fire a Lightning Bolt straight ahead to hit both of them. I hope they're not immune to lightning. We'll find out. From my penis. Just felt like I had to make that clear. Is it my spell save DC? With the hand-cone? 20. 27. It's powerful. Then I'll turn to our new friend Gern, and I will inspire him. I'll say, please, help us, and to inspire you I will sing you a song. And I will sing-- Oh, there's more. It might! It might. And so I sing (singing) To everything, Gern, Gern, Gern. There is a season, Gern, Gern, Gern. I just like to sing your name, Gern Blanston. Did that help? I don't know, he's got a fighting chance. I love that we were scrambling for d6's when we have this right in front of us. Where are we going to find...? Fatty lives! You can leap over me. Of course. It's poetic. What about Fatty, did he succeed? Jeez. Oh man, these are not used a lot. Two more? Good gravy. Yep. Taliesin, you don't have a d8? An actual sloth? Maybe you can reanimate him. Freezer burn? Ooh! Sounds scary. Pretty good. Pretty good. Who's behind me back there, way at the edge of the map? That's Vax? Oh, he'll be fine. Okay, I don't want to be near this thing, probably. Right? Okay, I'm going to take a step towards Vax. And away from Gern, right? So is Gern 15 feet away from me yet, so far? Okay. So I will then cast Thunderwave, which should not hit Gern, but will hit Vax. It's a 15-foot cube. Oh! Oh, great. I'll do that. And I'll do it at level two. Thunderwave. Yeah, originating from me. Not very much -- Ooh! That's pretty good. 20. I send the Thunderwave out by cracking my knuckles, and as I do so, I do ahem, Gern, might want to check this out. Gern! Gern, I'm doing something really cool here. Fuck. So I do it anyway but with a scowl on my face. Fuck! Oh, forget it, you had to be there. I kick the dirt. We have a sloth on standby. 15. Oh wait, with Pass Without a Trace? MARISHA and Hey! Oh, ten, sorry, ten, ten. It's going to be fine. I will, as well. Oh, with disadvantage, right? Look at the big brain on Gern. A nefreeti? These are Fireballs, right? No way. That does not hit me. No one's near the big guy. That's impressive. The vest? This is Coral. Snowball fight? What is holding the thing that's floating in the sky aloft? Is he flying? Is he supported on a column of fire? Oh, of course. And he's a larger creature or smaller? He's a large creature or smaller. Okay. I'm going to make him the boy in the bubble. I will cast Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. I'm going to make a bubble around him. Oh, sure, whatever. No, wait, but it was nine, right? You said? Just four? Oh, okay. I'll walk. He's going to hit me, isn't he? I'll do that, and then straight up in the air. It is. You're in a ball, motherfucker! Does he fall, or can he continue to fly? There is still air inside. Oh, fuck! Always look at me! Oh, and I'll turn around and I will heal Gern, because he's not doing great. With my bonus action, at a second level, I will cast Healing Word, and I will sing to him again, because he loves it so much. (singing) Gern, baby, Gern! Candle inferno! Gern, baby, Gern! Burn that mother down! Five. Do I roll, or does he? Somewhere between 50 and a million. I'm the little guy on the ground. I think I'll stay. It can't do anything. That'll hit anything. Two attacks towards me? Is that the attack roll? Feel the Gern, feel the Gern. Yes! I'm not looking at you, by the way. Yeah, I know! Well, the guy next to me might hit me, but whatever! Yeah, that's good. You do like dancing. We never do those! Oh, you have inspiration! Use a d10! Pitchy, little pitchy. Flat. Well, now you're sharp. Yep, your name was in the song! Oh, yes I am. Hey, how's that stuff under my feet? I'm going to step into it. So I can fire a Lightning Bolt and hit both of those guys. And yeah, that's it. That'll be my-- Oh, good! Okay, good, thank you for saving me. Oh, for once! Thank you! Thank you, it was for you! Okay, so 8d6? 33. It's the width that really does it. And I will re-inspire Gern. Oh, wait, you're still injured, aren't you? I will heal Gern. With another Healing Word. This time at third level. Okay, I'll do a 2nd-level Healing Word, and I will sing to him, because I'm running out of things that rhyme with his name (singing) Gern down for what! (EDM beat) Gern down for what! That's it. And I can move out? Will he take a swipe at me? I'm still on fire, right? Plus whatever I was on fire for. Oh, I did? At the beginning of my turn. Oh, okay, plus 12? He's gone. Yes! Sorry! Oi! We need someone to bring him down to earth. Keyleth, can you vine him down? Or, Gern, do you have something that can move things? Chromatic Orb? He's got something! What? A minute, but about 30 seconds have gone by. Can he push down? Oh, he's the best at arcana. What are we trying to do, shove him back into the hole? Nope. He used it. And steal the broom. I don't know these people. As it does that, do I recognize the spell? I cast Counterspell. Hi! I'm going to sing-- No! I'm going to distract it with this. With an app. (airhorn) (song starts) Oh, wait that's not what I wanted to do! Oh, don't do-- Okay. That's a spell? We have? Who did that? Of course. Hey, that Ioun stone that I have? Does that allow me to cast a fourth level three spell? It was a 3rd-level spell, so it's an extra 3rd-level spell? I'm maxed out on 3rd-level spells, but I still have that thing. No, I mean, the fourth time I've cast a 3rd-level spell. Okay! So I will, for the first time ever, use that stupid Ioun stone and cast Lightning Bolt again. I'm just sticking with my method here. 8d6, thank you. Thank you. Did you do this one too? 28! I think I would like to, if there's a way, I'd like to angle it somehow so that he will drop right on top of Grog. I feel like Grog can do something to a falling behemoth. Damn it. All right, yes, let's do that so Grog can feel like he gets part of this, too. And if I can, I'd like to burn a big S in his chest. What, what is it? You shouldn't have looked at me when I cast my spell! I was wrong to doubt you! You're a horrible person. Communicable diseases? What a nice guy he is! Certainly not someone we should swindle! That's true. That is true! A candle? Do you have any candles that could aid? Well-explained! I can inspire them. I mean... Dimension Door what? Do I know that that will work or help? Oh, yeah, are we still feasting? What is a hashtag? All right. Is it now? She's great. Vex? This gentleman has done nothing but aid us. He's suffered the loss of three of his-- Is there anything we can do to repay you? How do we do that? Your homeland is, you know, I mean, the volcano, the magma, the monsters, the fire torn in the sky, it's lovely. It's charming, really. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you lived here. You're not a Fire Ashari? Aren't all Ashari the same? I don't even know your last name! Hey, what's a hashtag? Feel the Gern. I didn't! I didn't! I'm judging you, Laura Bailey. (laughter) Vex is fine. Laura Bailey? Awful.
