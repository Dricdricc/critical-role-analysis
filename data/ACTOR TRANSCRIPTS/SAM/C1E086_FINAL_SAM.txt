-- about the company itself who so kindly sponsors us and about their founder, one Ebenezer Lootacrata. Born on a silk-worm farm in Budapest in 1919, Ebenezer Lootacrata was a unique child. His siblings-- Claudrica, Piterca, Dominocos, and Bob-- would always play checkers, but Ebenezer was fascinated by the box they came in. In fact, he was obsessed with boxes. Did he wear briefs? No, boxers. He traded in his backpack for a backbox. He wouldn't eat jelly from jars. He scooped it out of a large pine jelly box. Dick-in-a-box? He invented that in 1930. And in 1937 he packed up everything that was special to him-- one shirt, one sticker, one comic book, and one toy-- placed them in a crate and set off for college. One day later, he was expelled from college because he did not own pants. But he had a vision! A revolutionary idea! Before, people had boxes and people had cool stuff, but he dared to put the cool stuff inside the boxes! He named his company "Lootacrata". In America we bastardize it as Loot Crate, but history has never been the same. And you guys should know that you should go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole.

TALIESIN and Thor's a god. Special guests? If anyone would like to sponsor-slash-marry her, she could stay-- (all laugh) She's why it looks good now. Let's bring the show to her! Still his name. Still his name. Friends call me Tary, Jumbo. No, you're Jumbo, I'm Tary. Sure. Do you write? T-A-R-Y-O-N-D-A-R-R-I-N-G-T-O-N Oh, you want me to write it down. I understand. A scholarly mind is not a thing to shirk. Doty, write out my name in the finest calligraphy and give him a page. You're quite welcome, Jumbo. What, what is it? Are you the leader of this collection of individuals? You are the biggest. Hm. All right. Have we already begun our mission that we're on right now? Oh. You're right. What's your name? I am a bit confused at what's going on here so-- (all laugh) Taryon Darrington. You may have heard of me. Friends call me Tary.  Well, you will once my book comes out. Oh, yes. Quite fancy. Deadly as well. You have more than one hand with you right now? Okay... Just tell me when to start swinging the sword. Sure. They're quite-- quite lovely. (all laugh) Wine, mostly, yes. Doty. He does not drink. Yes? Why, I made him! Yes, I did? I-- no offense, but I doubt you would understand the inner workings of something as complicated as this. All right, I will. Are you familiar with levers? Things that move up and down? Yes? Some of those. There's also a machine called a pulley where you can apply force and it will amplify it with a wheel and a string.  Some of those are in there. Also, an incline. It's another simple machine. I did build it. I did build it. Pretty fancy technological speak. Why do you care to know? Won't happen. Doty has my back. Right, Doty? I'm a bit of a tinkerer. I can show you a few things if we have a quiet moment, not in public. I look forward to the lesson. My name? Nope. You misheard me, Little Elf Boy, it's Taryon Darrington. Nope, not from here. Matt, we discussed this, where am I from? (all laugh) And I was like, "hmm, I don't know what any of those--" I can also look it up. What he just said. Have you been? It's quite lovely. My family has quite a reputation there and I live on a vast compound with beautiful orchards and-- I'm sorry, no, I don't know them. I have not, I'm sorry. Is Antlers okay over here? All right. She seems a bit drunk already or something. All right. I wouldn't say pampered. All right? I had a normal upbringing. Private tutors, classes-- I wandered through the halls of our extensive library many nights. Read many books about adventure-- -- exploration, magic, alchemy-- I mean... you know. My family runs a very prosperous business, and yes, I have received some benefits from that. But I am a self-starter in my own mind and-- I've gone out on my own to seek my fortune-- -- and record my exploits. I purchased it myself. With my money, that-- -- that I can withdraw once a month. (all laugh) But it is mine. It belongs to me. It's my birthright. Doty. I have a list of adventures that I am currently going through. Some of the adventures include Rescue a maiden-- Transport a treasure. Escort a muckety-muck. A revenge plot. A classic dungeon crawl. Oh, this one I'm looking forward to! Solving a mysterious riddle. The old fashioned double-cross. Teleport, haven't done that yet. Shopping mission, but really I can wait on that one. (all laugh) Shopping? It's low on the list. It's a low one. All right, I will. Have you? You haven't really, have you? An actual dragon? What was it like? I mean-- Healthy AND sane? You seem healthy. You certainly are decked out in adventuring gear, which is quite attractive. Sanity I can't be a good judge of yet, I just met you. You seem like lovely creatures. I'm a young 28. Is that true? Oh, that is strange. Youthful exuberance, I suppose. (hearty laugh) The other end will be my masterpiece, my book. Doty has been very, very good about taking down all of my adventures and exploits, and at the end of it all... I know we just met, but may I share with you some of my working titles? All right. Maybe you fellows could help me pick a title. Here's what I have so far. That was a good one, but I have some other ones. Tarry On with Taryon Darrington. The Terrific and Terrifying Tales of Daring Taryon Darrington-- Fifty Shades of Tary. (all laugh) Zen and the Art of Robot Manservant Repair. Adventuring for Dummies. The Things They Tarried. The Blond Hair of Courage. (all laugh) The Odyssey. Tary's Daring Do's and Daring Do-Nots. Dungeons and Darringtons. And this one just popped into my head Critical Patrol. (all laugh) Hm? Oi. In my account? I would not care to say. We're in a public place. (whispers) I would not care to say. Does this helmet look like it's something that didn't cost a shit ton of money? All right, well, if you don't want the money, we can break the contract right now, and I'll go my way. All right, I will. Come with me over to the corner. Are we away from--? I'll reach into my Bag of Holding And pull up just a handful of coin. Ding! I'm sorry, Little-- Yes, well, I didn't choose to be, and I am trying to lead my life honest and true, humble and brave, every day of my life. And I thank you for allowing me to travel with you, and perhaps go on a mission? I mean, is this mission going to start at some point? I'm sorry? I... not to be a pest, but-- I paid for adventure. Okay. I understand. Understood. And happy to be one. Yeah. That makes total sense. Oh, yes? Doty. He does what I tell him to do. I would say so. Doty has been in a battle. Doty. That may be because in battle I am deft, fearless. No deft, with a T. I can dodge blows uncannily. I can anticipate what my opponent is going to do ahead of time and dodge out of the way. Yes. I think I am. No, he's a mechanical construct that I made, he did not-- Doty did not raise me. He is a mechanical construct that I built when I learned how. He does not cook. He could clean. I--- No, he's cold as ice. Well I'm 28 now. So that would have been 27. He's a year old. Nope. He doesn't talk to me. He's the best really. Fearless, strong, big, and excellent penmanship. He's everything I could hope for in a friend. Silent. I mean, no. I don't think I ever had a penpal. I had tutors. I had the best teachers. I had-- LAURA and --wonderful. No, no! Don't 'aww'. They were wonderfully smart and engaging, but my best friends were the books I read. They're still alive. There's no were. They are wonderful people my father-- (sighs) My father is a very talented businessman. He can be hard at times. He has great expectations for everyone he meets. My mother is... a saint; she's perfect in every way. She's a wonderful person and... yes. No, they are eagerly awaiting me to arrive back at home and tell them tales of my journeys and adventures. He is a businessman.  No! Not at all. It's just, I'm not sure how well versed you are in financial transactions. He is in real estate. He buys and sells properties, charges rent, taxes... He owns a lot of things, places and makes a lot of money off of these places. I will be forthcoming with anything that you ask me. I have nothing to hide. I come from money; this is clear. Taryon Darrington. Nice to meet you. Be pleased. You're welcome. Anderson? You have his name? Holy Bajoly! I didn't know that he had a name! I'm sorry? There's no kerfuffle on the list-- --but we are going to have an adventure, is that right? At some point? All right. So far, we've delivered a dead body part to someone, and had a brief conversation with a guard. Is this what you all are about? All right. Are you speaking metaphorically? All right. I don't know what you're talking about. I... All right. Yes. Oh, well maybe I should pay him to take me on an adventure because Jesus Christ. This is about as fucking boring as I can get. No, really? It's on my list; it's literally on my list. All right, all right, all right! Finally getting my money's worth. It's Taryon! Doty. Cool. Doty, take this down. As the tree split in front of me-- Ahhh! Oh my. Oh my gods. Where are we? What's going on?  What happened? Where am I? Is this a fantasy world? What happened? Ahh! Wow! That was exhilarating! It's like my body fell apart and came back together again! It was amazing! I felt a great force behind me, pushing me forward! And then all of a sudden I opened my eyes and was in a new place. Doty, take this down. Today is the greatest day of Taryon Darrington's life. The day that he experienced the wonder of the gods. That's enough for now. It's amazing. Yes, quaint really. Tourists must love it here. I literally know nothing about this city. I paid for adventure. All right. Doty. Four-eyes, shall I trust Jumbo here because he seems a bit shady. I will roll an insight check. What do I add to it? Oh yeah, that. I have forgotten how to play Dungeons and Dragons. 18. Go on! What's going on out here? For what? Doty. He's right behind me, as he always is. What's going to happen? That's the best thing you've ever said, Marisha. Of course I've played Boulder, Paper, Shears. One, two, three-- Fuck, I'm dead. I will be dead. Doty is going to use his reaction to attack Vax. Right? Because when attacked within five feet of me, he gets to react? To defend me? Or to attack? 86 to me? Great. Great. (pained grunt) This is the sound that I make. (high pitched goat-like yelps) (all laugh) Do I get a shot? Wait, you guys are all doing this to me? Eight. (choking noise) You shouldn't bother. It's over! (muffled scream) (gasping for breath) (whimpers) (gasps loudly) (high-pitched) What? Who said that? Why is the wind blowing? Hands shaking, body quivering, blood everywhere. (all laugh) I-- I, shit, well Grog gets an attack, but I'm going to-- Oh, I'm going to counter clockwise around Doty, all the way round. Yeah, yeah. All the way round, yeah. So I'm facing Grog and the others, in a sort of a cone pattern. And I fumble, I'm fumbling on the helmet, trying to find the right gem to pull out. And I pull out a diamond. And I pluck it out of the helmet and I go (screams). And I will cast Prismatic Spray. Oh! On me? The helm is 18. Wow. Wow, guys. Do I roll? Do you roll? Maybe you should roll. Oh, okay. 10d6 what damage? Okay. (gasps) How are they still alive? (all laugh) Well, first of all, as my bonus action, I will cast Sanctuary on myself. It protects me from things. (all laugh) They're all new, friend. Doty, I will say, (gasping for breath) Doty, save me... Save me! Hit the big guy! I'm dead. I don't attack of opportunity, do I? Got it. Dammit, Doty, do better! What? You're not gonna kill me? I got tricks. My spell DC? Is 17. What do I do? Oh, that's not gonna go well. Yeah, that's an 11. I have your book. But I need it more than you, you get nothing! Oh my God. Yeah. Alive? Who's talking?! (yells) No, this is not good. I can't do this. I can't do any of this. I'm sorry. I'm not a real adventurer. That was a story I told you. I know it was very convincing, but I haven't been on any real adventures, ever, and-- I know that you thought that I was an adventurer. I know that you all look at me and you just see the armor and the handsomeness-- --and the bravado. And you think, he has it all. He has everything that we want. But it's a lie. It's a ruse. I... can I be real with you guys? (tearfully) My sister's gonna get everything. All the money. The whole business. The compound, the villas, everything. He's giving it to my sister unless I prove myself. All right? I just came out here to prove myself to my old man. And I know that if I do, he will respect me finally, and he will give me my money, and my trust fund, and he will give me my villa, and I will be the guy who takes over the business. And I just-- I thought that I could. But I can't. And I neeeed to. (all laugh) I need to, I need to. He doesn't like me, and he doesn't like the books I read, and he doesn't like that I like fantasy novels, and he doesn't like anything about me. (yelps) I can be like an apprentice. Or an intern. You guys are so powerful and I'm not. Really? No. Only when I go to sleep at night. (all laugh) No, I'm brave and strong. No, I don't drink beer. Yes. Really? Because the stuff we had in Ank'harel was really gross. I didn't wanna say anything, but-- It was really gross. It had no terroir. No! I don't have any wine. Doty. Doty, no! Why? Just pause for now. Doty is my best friend. My only friend. Because he listens to me, and understands me, and at night, when I play my characters, he plays with me. I play combat, and I pretend to be some of the characters I've read about, and he pretends to be the others. No, I want to be a hero. And I just haven't had the chance yet because my father says that I should just be focused on taking over the family business, learning financial things. And learning how to shake down a customer, and I'm so much more than that. Tell me one. Do they write books about philanthropists? But the stories I've read of adventure and derring-do and bravery-- Much cooler! Jumbo gets it. He could have me or any of you killed. Which is? Very much. Okay. But how will I survive in battle? Oh, I do. I do. They look very powerful. Something about your eyes make me feel ashamed. I'm sorry. Please don't. You do? All right, let's go get drunk, then. TALIESIN and I understand. I haven't really experienced loss of that type before. I mean. But I want to understand, and I thank you for your honesty with me and for not holding back. Did I at least cause you some harm in the battle? That's good, right? All right. It was really great. It was really great? Thank you, thank you all. I'm sorry for deceiving you before, and I promise to do better and to aid you in whatever way I can. Please teach me your ways, and I will learn what I can. For heaven's sake, yes! I did. Please no, no, I, no-- All right, I hang back just a little bit to collect myself. Just try to dry my eyes, and I say to Doty Doty, just delete most of that last chapter-- -- and take this down. "The battle a draw, Taryon decided it was better to lie than tell the "truth, and embarked on a new adventure pretending to be their humble intern, when in actuality, "they were working for him." End of chapter! That's exactly what they're planning on doing! They just said that they're taking me to hell, or something like that! Was that your girlfriend, Jumbo? Was that your girlfriend? Oh. Sorry. I don't-- I'm just trying to catch up. I'll-- My hand? My hand? Please don't kill me. He's really a rotten guy. (sighs) He does these unfair deals-- nobody knows about them but me, and I tried to tell him to play on the up and up but he's just a liar and a cheat. Oh, thank you. Month, month and a half. I hired a band of mercenaries to assist me for the first month. No, they left me. (all laugh) Truth. Yes, it is. Taryon Gary Darrington. (all laugh) Yes, he is. She's the fucking worst. Yes, she's so-- She's such a jock. She just does push-ups and sit-ups and pull-ups all day and all night and beats on me. She's younger than me, but she's so much stronger. Her name is-- I wrote this down. (ugly cries) (all laugh) Mary-Anne Darrington. My father, Howard-- -- and my mom, Maria. Younger! No. She's not a married Marion. (all laugh) She's all focused on the business, and taking it over when Dad's ready to retire. Yes. Yes, I learned so much. I was left to my own devices for hours on end. I traveled the world... in literature. And I experienced such great adventures, tales of history and fiction and-- For most of my life, I was just a happy-go-lucky kid in my room. Reading my books, and making up characters that I would fight against, and only recently have things gotten pretty bad with Dad, since I am now of age to take over the business, and uh-- Well, he's getting up in years. Wants to retire to the southern villa. It's less about strength and more about a cutthroat attitude. Take no prisoners. Hold back nothing. Pull no punches. To be honest, he doesn't take me along with him to many business deals, but he has great influence over many places and cities, and important people, and I don't exactly know the ins and outs of the business-- No, I mean, we had a grandfather, so I-- I mean, I think he's not really a bastard. I think. I don't know. What do you mean? (all laugh) He has a father. I think so. They were around a lot. He's an asshole. Howard. No. You're all literate? You can read and write? Wow. I haven't met many of you in my travels that have-- That's amazing. Really? Oh? Perhaps we can compare books later? This guy-- This excites me. Really? That piece of equipment you showed to that weirdo earlier today-- the thing with the handle? Did you make that? What does that-- What does that do? That is-- Sexy. It's very sexy. Wow. And did you make this by yourself? Wow. Is the propellant part of this piece right here? Or is it in that big piece right there? Or is it magical? Oh... Wow. That's impressive. Oh, you know what? I'm sorry. One second. I forgot, I owe you some money, don't I? The adventure was 50 thousand, correct? I think I had a good adventure today. But I didn't die. So, minus the Prismatic Spray, that's 6000 gold taken off. Minus the wear and tear on my armor and equipment, that's another 5000 taken off. Minus the fact that I wasn't the star of the adventure, I'll halve the rest of it. Do you have a tax ID or some sort of tax-exempt status? I'm just trying to find out how much I actually owe you. I am a man of business and I always follow the law. So by my calculations, 20% federal taxes, 9.5% local and city taxes, I put that at about 11,000 gold total left still. Doty? Write a check. Of course. How is she tax-exempt? Make it 16. My father will pay that. In full. Go on and reach in there. Nope. Is he holding any equipment or weapons? Okay. Fire. And I set his weapon on fire. It's cool, though, right? No, no, it's magical, it's good. It helps! Why would you touch a flame? (whispers) Is he an idiot? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just getting used to this. All right. Absolutely. Was it really bad? Did I sound okay? Thank you. I am so appreciative of all of you, and I will repay this debt, I promise you. I will make you guest-stars in one chapter of my book, and it will be top three most epic chapters. Yes, absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. All right. I accept your conditions. You have a workshop? For tinkering? Ooh, I like you. Absolutely. And I could show you the inner workings of Doty. It's pretty outstanding if I do say so myself. Little bit of luck, little bit of magic. Good evening. Bye. You guys are gonna fuck in the treasury? Oh my god! (all laugh) She meant the doctor's office. I got it. We're up here. Yeah. Just to keep up the audience We're in Maine, and we're trying to get to Los Angeles. TALIESIN and As Taryon, can't we teleport to wherever we're trying to go? Ooh. I've read about most people and places. Yeah, that's a one. Her eyes just intimidate me. Worth it. Oh shit! Okay, no. Nothing. I had resistance to something and I forgot to use it. (all laugh) Yeah. Would not have helped me very much. (whispered) I'll take everything. I have magic that can make things that are way more real than a drawing. I think it's magnificent, what you've put together here. And I'm impressed, and from me that's quite a compliment. You know what? I don't normally do this, but... What's your name? (all laugh) Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo the third. All right. I'm Tary to mine. Hm. It is my honor and privilege to be your guest, sir. All right, well. Okay. (all laugh) Doty! Doty, put it as a maybe. Doty, put it as a maybe for catchphrases. (gasps) Oh my god, every time it's amazing. Wow, thank you. Thank you all. Where are we? Of? So cool. I loved it, you can do no wrong. Just a stick. Just a stick. It doesn't do anything. Good old RCD. Lovely to meet you. I have no idea where we are right now. You're welcome. Kaiahoga. I pull Vax aside and say-- Poise, grace, confidence, she is amazing. Is she your leader? (quietly) Incredible. I'm learning so much already, thank you again. Absolutely. The what in my mouth? Absolutely. I will do it. You're absolutely right. Mm-hm. Following the local customs, I took a handful of dirt and shoved it down my fucking throat. (all laugh) (coughs) (coughs) Thank you. Yeah, that is my vocal cords being covered in dirt. I just ate dirt. I'll go into my satchel and pull out some healing draught, and just-- ah, just take a big gulp. Okay. Much better. Shall we? Boat shoes? I own boat shoes. They're great, they're flat-soled, they are white, and-- Yes, they are-- Boat shoes. Of course. Yes, they are. With little leather stripes-- Yeah. And a little sailor's cap. I have a navigator's kit. Let's set sail! A sextant and everything. They're all dead. We'll never know. No, we do not tip him. He's literally picking up dried pieces of seagull poop. (all laugh) And a robot. He doesn't eat, it'll be fine. She is such not a good negotiator. What is going on? Oh, sorry. I will be quiet. I'll be-- you're right. You're right, I will be quiet. I had a boat-- I had a boat in one of my larger baths that I would take at night, and it would go on epic adventures through the bubbles! But never quite at sea. The boat was the SS... ... that's it. (all laugh) That's such a cool name. You can sail all night while we sleep on the ship. That is true. Poetically it would be nice, but-- I am eager to get my adventuring on, L.E.B., so I am eager to go. You're asking us to get her drunk? Is that true? Is that what's happening? A sea voyage. This is unprecedented. Doty, take down every word of anyone saying anything ever on this whole trip. This is amazing. I'm so excited. Well, okay, all right, so zing, you got me. You're smarter than I thought, you.
