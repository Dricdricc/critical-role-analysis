Thanks! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! I'm already here! Music's working? Way to bring down the room. We're on! (cheering) We should probably just finish. But we just woke up. Sounds good. It's not the size of your ears... Good day. Do you want me to burn it down? Good day. Sure, yes, do you have an oolong? I am called the Kingslayer, Chuck Norris, Burt Reynolds. I have many names. You see, when you've traveled a road as long as I have-- What a battle! Duskward. As well as access to certain parts of the city. We need some items to acquire within the city before we set out. And I had asked for an oolong tea. (laughter) Good day. We thought so little of him we didn't even remember his name. (laughter) But also we respect him enough to learn his name. You got it! It's true. Vax wanted to go inside the dragon, I was like, no! No, let's do it! (laughter) Do you want me to take a dump somewhere? Oh, sorry. That's gnomish. Doesn't mean the same thing. Do you have any blueberries? She got it at preschool. Ooh, good object work. Oh, it flew away! Tea spit take! Do we have accommodations in the city? Are you hitting on their dad? It does. Good day. Oh, you're the lady of the house that I burned down. I did. I did. You should just say it even louder to make sure people know the correct pronunciation. Bidet! Oh shit. I don't know any of those words. We need to talk to the little fucker. Right, so we pick the biggest room and we all enter it. Titicaca. No, I just like saying that. Insight-check him. Natural one. (laughter) Yeah, you told us about all three dangers that we have to face. Just tell us what the two things are we that we need to steal. It's a belt buckle. He can't help it, he's a klepto. Maybe we can even find a clue about where this crest thing is from the meeting. It just says we get one meeting, I don't think it's been "sheduled" yet. Should we go "shedule" it? Ooh! Because you're a lady. When would we like the meeting? Tonight or tomorrow? LAURA and Today! Later today. Right after siesta. He's in the room. (laughter) No, how do we know if we can chip a piece off without ruining it? No. It's like one in the afternoon, so we'll probably just go. Yes. As we walk I say to Vax Oi, Vax. What is the reason for this meeting? When we get in there, what do we say to her? Find Fenthras on our own, what? Oh, the hat. Not old enough for our party to kill mercilessly. We sit. Go on. Oh, that's better. Are there any guards in here with us? I have a little bit of business. Everyone who meets me knows I am a collector of hats. (laughter) Yes. It's a fine garment woven by a master craftsman. I hear you have a fine hat, as well, that you've been seen wearing about town. Is that true? As a fine appreciator of the haberdasher arts-- (laughter) Blue hat? Tri-tip, triangular-- I just hear it's fantastic, I've never seen one quite like it up close. I was wondering if I could take a look-see. With disadvantage. Well, that was a natural 20. But the first one was a six. Luckily, it's plus 14, so 20. (laughing and cheering) [no audio] Thank you so much, it would mean so much to me. I've never met a hat I didn't like. Should we just wait here, or is it going to be a while? There's a hat room? I have a hat room in my place, too! High Warden, High Warden. I went to Syngorn and all I got was this lousy shirt? The room I could care less about, it's those hats! You're a hatter, too! Hold on, he's making a check. High Warden Tyrelda. Yes, well, there's another lady named Lady Tyrell, who's... "Shedule." Well, what do we see? Grog might know. Natural one. (laughter) Is it like Storage Wars, where there might be something? Well, I searched terribly. We don't have to distract him, he said it's all for the taking. No, that's fine, we don't have to. Let's get out of here. No, let's leave. --get out of here. We got the hat. I am more than satisfied. I will write a five-star review. Well, some of us could slip in anyway, but what do you think we will find there? Fake them out? What do you mean, fake them out? Well, Vex, they could repair it; they have magicians here and stuff. With arcane juju. We're a close-knit family. No, we do what we want. We all sleep together; it's a polyamorous thing. (laughter) 21. Yeah, man. We are freak-ay. We may need you to clean up for us later. Garmelie, show thyself. You don't know. Any ideas there, Garmelie? Are the guards following? Good sesh. I hate that direction. Are those different directions? Can we travel any faster than that? Can we mist, can we tree, can we...? Would that save time, I don't remember how fast we go. It's fine. Oh god. Not a compliment. Are we going to have roll initiative on grass? Your emotions. Because you yelled at it. I sing a song. (singing) Keep growing. Keep flowing, knowing you can always count on me. TRAVIS, LAURA, and (singing) That's what Scanlan's for. (cheering) Come on, persuade that plant. That was a leaner. It's more than that. How do you want to mow this? (laughter) Then we should go the other way. Because we don't trust a fucking thing you say. I'll allow it. Ulurat? It's fine. We've killed dragons, we'll be fine. Audience, please. (cricket noises, laughter) We can't even see them, Matt? We have a hat. A really good hat. You're part bear now!
