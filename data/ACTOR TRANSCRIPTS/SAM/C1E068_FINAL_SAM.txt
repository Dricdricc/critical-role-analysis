Loot Crate, guys. (clears throat) Okay, so here's the thing-- Oh, don't worry, I'll come up with something. Loot Crate, guys. They gave us some great information about their next month's theme, which they're going to announce on the 26th, which is Monday. They didn't tell us what the theme was, but that's the exciting part, because now we get to speculate. I've prepared three ideas for what next month's Loot Crate theme might be. Just spitballing here. Number one Screws and Nails. It's just a box of screws and nails. You got your wood screws, you got your metal screws, your two-inchers, your one-inchers. Pretty cheap to produce. Yeah, and useful! Number two Storks! The theme is Storks, the movie Storks that's out this week. It includes a handwritten letter from Andy Samberg, trying to beg you to go to see the movie. (laughter) Yeah, it is out now. Storks, animated film. And number three-- this is what the theme for Loot Crate could be, announced on Monday. It could be 50 Shades of Grey. They give you a ball gag, some can [no audio], and your own personalized safe word. Mine is "harder, baby, harder," which is very confusing. (laughter) I'm going to do that right now. Guys, so far, Storks is just eking out 50 Shades of Grey and Nails & Screws. It's tight now. It's 32%, 32% and 36%. Who knew? I'm going to mount Grog. And say, Let's go scan around the tree line, friend. Fly! Fly! You're an eagle. One. With my brand-new awesome d20. You didn't see anything, Groggy? Guess not. I'm in the air, you can't talk to me. I'm on an [no audio]. All right. I will turn Grog's head and point him back to the campsite. Well, I'll say to you, oi, if you don't see anything, caw once and we'll head back to camp. I forgot you can't count. All right, we just fly around then. Percy, you're going to need a bigger boat. (laughter) Yeah, he can bite the wind. Are we all? We're not all rolling, just-- Oh. 19. Kill the wind! Let's go! Bye, Grog. You'll be fine. I like this plan. Suicidal eagle. Oh! Oh, I was on him. Sure, I guess I'm taking this ride too. No, I would have gone with him. Sure. Well, I can't do much now because if I do anything, he'll break his eagle form. And then I'll fall too! So I'm 100 feet up. Straight up over this thing. Right? 80 feet up. Okay, I hang over the side and I will Lightning Bolt straight down into the eye of the tornado. Oh, it's 21. 28. Oh. So it did not take full-- Yeah, I mean, I don't want to move. I'll inspire Grog. I will sing in his ear (singing) Fly like an eagle to the sea. Fly like an eagle-- don't drop me! (laughter) LIAM, MARISHA and Ooh, what is that all about? It breaks in half. Super old, it doesn't work. Put up or shut up, Keyleth. It's like you were built for this fight. Wow! They're all the same. You killed the wind! Me? I have to do something now? I will do Bigby's Hand, and it's a concentration spell so Polymorph would drop for Grog. Right on the guy who's right in front of us. Yes, Grog, yes. Does it look like hitting it hurt it? Okay, well then I'll punch it. I'll punch it in its wind face. Is that a futzed roll? I need a judgment. Okay. Nine plus 11. 20. Nah, I'll just do this. 18. I will inspire Vax with a selection from The Ultimate Dad Jokes. Should I pick a random page? A conductor once told me that a euphonium is Latin for you're a fraud. What's the name of the movie about the Cow von Trapp family? The Sound of Moo-sic. Oh, fellow dad for that joke. Well, it's been d10 for a while. Yeah, it's d10. You have inspiration. Whoa! Trinket attack something? Bite the wind! Natural 20! Wow. Two 20s, two ones so far. Sure. I'm a master swordsman. I draw my blade. Talk to me, baby. Oh, great. Yes. Wait, those elementals that we fought-- were they left by Ripley? Was it a trap? Did we activate a trap? Is she close by? She can't have gotten far. What if she's teleporting out of here? I don't know why I'm saying this, but I trust Trinket. Yes. (laughter) I'll heal everything but his face. Let's see here. No, I'm terrible. It's tiny. I will do a 2nd-level Healing Word, as well. Which is what, 2d4? Oh, wait! Before we charge off into the jungle, didn't you get a shit-ton of potions? Can you hand those out, please? Check them for traps. Oh, hello! What is that all about? (whispering) They were playing marbles. It looks small now. Everything looks tiny. I'll take a look at these for arcana. Oh! 19, plus stuff. Plus seven. You still have inspiration, Grog. I am looking for literally nothing. Seven. All right, new dice. Three. (whispering) I don't know what's going on. (quietly) There's no one really listening to us, so we can talk as loud as we want. I'm in the back-back. Detect evil? Is that a thing that exists? What? (whispering) Okay. Thank god! What? I can go in there on the hamster ball, but that doesn't do any-- I thought she can't be magicked. But we need you on sharpshooter duty. As a seasoned magic expert, you're going to have to be pretty fucking close to do that, friend. I'll try. Percy, I need you to do something right now. Make me a minor illusion of Ripley. Just a picture. Just a picture. A headshot. That's all I want. Create it right here. Good dog. I call the dog. I say, look at this face. Go grapple that face. Go! Go now! I'm releasing the dog. Oh, hi. I'm Scanlan. Yes, I forgot you can talk. Oh, hi. We're your new masters. Do you like kibble or meat, or something? Can I ask a favor of you? We are really in a pickle and we need you to go grab someone by the face and hold her down. Oh shit. (laughs) On the count of ten, maybe? This image, this picture. If you go over that little ridge line there, you're going to see three figures. One will be she. Go put your maw on her face and grab it. You're a good doggy! Yes, you are! Do you have a name? It does? I thought it was good doggy. Onyx dog? I think we're going to start out under where Vex is flying, like if she bird pooped on us. I'm releasing a dog. I say to Percy, should we hear her out? I'll shout at her what do you want to say? We will. I will also inch back and try to heel the dog. Back! It's okay. 16. Jesus. Whispers! Whispers. Oh, you're taking the DM chair. They're so cute over there. Does the dog need to make a dex save? How do I do that for the dog? Six. 14. Nice. Oh my god. Wow. You like that dice. It's been hit or miss. "I rolled gold." Six. See you guys in a half hour. A different dice, too. She's the anti-Percy. Me? Jesus, I can't do shit. I get up. Those are holes, craters? Okay. I get up to the edge. I can only run another 15 feet or something, right? I get closer to the edge as far as I can. Shit. Man, I can't do much. How far apart are the farthest of the far? How about that one and the next one? Okay. Yeah. I'll fire a Fireball to those two in the corner. That's good. 35. For my bonus action, can I take a potion. Is that bonus-able action? Okay, I'll take a greater, which is how many? That's my move. See you in a half hour. How many more attackers don't we see? Sorry, before you do this. Before you spend all this time. Is this one 60 feet away from me? I am going to Counterspell that. It's a d20? Fuck you. 12. I can inspire myself? To inspire myself, I take a big handful of fusaka. (laughter) Another four. Only up to 16. Terrible rolls! I got spice in my nose. And neither was I 24. 24. I rolled a 19. Is this Prismatic Spray? Oh shit. That's a good spell. I do! 23. Just going down and down. I like this. That's much better than those other numbers that you were saying. That's a cool spell. Even on an attack of opportunity, you mean? Who that? You get advantage against bullets, right? Why don't you marry her? TALIESIN This whole fight's going to end with us kissing. We're going to start making out. It's going to be a big ugly makeout. Wow, you caught a bullet. Kill him. Destroy his life. It's a very muddled playing field. And I'm so far away from everyone. I'm going to yell Grog! Hold on to something, man! And so I'm going to case Reverse Gravity right there. And get everyone over here. And Ripley, if she's not immune to it. Sorry, Grog! You're going on a ride! They're gunners, right? I'm going to hold them. I'm going to hold in place, and let's all go around, find Ripley. Sorry! Other than the mage and maybe Ripley, everyone's off-- no, and the fucker Kynan. No, that gunner should have been in the radius. 50-foot radius. I cast it right there. 21. Yes, I'm going to move. Jesus, what's the fastest way to get across this stupid crevasse? Through it? It'll take me like, a minute to get all the way around there. I can't do shit while I'm casting a spell. I'm going to start walking around the circle. Yeah. I do have a healing bonus action. So you're dying? Okay, so I'll turn to Vex and I'll heal her. I'll sing (singing) I heal you. I heal you so bad. I heal you so bad, it's driving me mad, it's driving me mad. Two. Ooh! 12. Negative 115, or something like that. Floats 100 feet in the air. Oh, shit. Do I get to inspire myself on the save? 12. Get ready to fall, there, Grog. It's about to happen. That's okay. 12. (chokes) And everyone falls. I killed two people! Oh, wow. That's rare. Upper 90s. Start healing everyone. (singing) Heal the world. Make it a better place. Have you ever used Diplomacy? He'll be okay, he'll be okay. That's fine. You'll be fine. You'll be fine. Kynan going to die. For himself. That goliath is dead. Rage-climb! That goliath went on quite the ride. Down the crevasse, up 100 feet, down, down again. Oh, boy. (whispering) One point! (poink, power down sound) (muffled, laughing) Oh my god. What?! Fucking what? You just died, motherfucker! (incredulously) 4d8 plus four? That's a significant spell. Shit, yeah! Ahh, what a crazy dream. Nope, it's real. Well, tell me what you want, what you really really want! All right. I run over to Keyleth. Yeah, sure. I'll Healing Word at level two to get her back to life. 2d4 plus six is ten. No, 12. I turn to fuck-nuts over there and I'll send a Fireball to kill the fucking gunner. It's 150. Oh, and I'll do three charges, so it's 10d6. 27. Not very good. Reckless, Great Weapon Master. It sounds great. She gets to fart twice, right in front of you. She's better than you, Percy. Pike's necklace goes, meh? That is a bold, scaredy-cat move. Just kill him! Elemental! I look at Keyleth, and I fucking heal her. (laughter) I will level-one Healing Word, bonus action. Nine. You're at nine. Someone's got to do this, and it can't just be Grog. I'm going to Dimension Door over right next to Grog. Yep. Toward Ripley's side. Yeah, then I'm going to use the rest of my movement to move around, 25 feet, and go like this. Looking for Ripley. Sure, whatever. As a smoke monster, wouldn't he hurt his feetsies on the glass? That sounds like an awesome band name. Taliesin, we are being killed by a metaphor right now. I will Counterspell that at level six. A 3rd-level spell? It's gone. I shout out (singing) Anna-anna, bo-bana, banana fana fo-fana, hey fi-fo-mana. Fuck you! (laughter) Me? 22. I've heard of them. You cast Heal on Percy last. That was the last thing you did. You used Healing Word. You're alive for once. Yeah, that's fun. Do that. Wait. No. Can I gingerly walk on the glass? Will that be where she was when she disappeared? I'm going to go gingerly there, where she was. I draw my blade, get it ready to rock, and inspire-- I'm going to inspire myself, because I'm a selfish motherfuck. (laughter) You can't inspire yourself? That is true. Well, then I will inspire Grog. I'm sorry, who? A Washington team, whose name I dare not say? I'll inspire you with a dad joke. It's another cow one. Why did the cow want to go to Hollywood? He wanted to be in-- TALIESIN AND I'm ready. I'm holding my action until she reappears. Yes! That would be hilarious! That's not the dice he rolls for attacks! (laughter) You delivered ten points of damage while you were gone. Oh shit! Stab, stab, stab! Are you fucking kidding me? I'm throwing my sword! I'm throwing my sword. Yeah! I have advantage on my attack because I just inspired. Mythcarver. 13. Can I do Cutting Words? Has a whole round gone by since my last reaction? I'm going to reduce her attack. 27? Does he have cover like he did before? Why is this on me, guys?! Two. Kill Orthax. I walk over and pick up my sword slowly. Even gingerly? And hold my attack in case maybe she bamfs back. I'm holding a spell. I think she's resistant to it, but I will hold Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. I will encapsulate her, or attempt to. 21, with disadvantage, because I Cutting Words-ed her. You can curse. It's okay; you killed one of us. Okay. Everyone gather around her. I'm going to drop this thing, and we're all going to fucking kill her together. I slowly walk up to her with the sword in my hand. No magic can happen in the orb. Vax, you with us? Ready? For Percy. Percy's killing you right now, not us. I drop it, and we all attack. I'd like to carve the de Rolo crest into her forehead. No. Shit. Next week, with new Vox Machina member Wil Wheaton. Thank you for your service, Taliesin. Wheaton will be joining us every week.
