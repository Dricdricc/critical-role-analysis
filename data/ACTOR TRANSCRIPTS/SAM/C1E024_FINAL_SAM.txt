Whoa. Were you just talking about me? Whoa, that's crazy. I was just talking about me, too. Oh, that's right. I saw. Some of that I had my ghostwriter write for me. I have a biographer and a ghostwriter. Yeah, sure. No. Just that I don't have any dice but I can use Orion's and they're going to be awesome. Great. Thanks. We don't have 600 gold? Who's our treasurer?! Should we pay another month? It's okay. It gets better. You know her name, but you've never seen her before? Oh, so you could recognize her. How many years ago was this? What are the other ones? Well, this is certainly tragic, but looking forward, what do we know of this meeting? Event? Party? What are we doing? Well, do they know Percy's among us? And if we kill them, how much will you pay us? Just kidding. We ask other people that. We could go into town, and find you a bushy mustache. It's worked for me many times. Well, that cap is more of a hat. While wearing this hat you can use an action to cast Disguise spell. Oh. Cast a Disguise spell? Do you have to be a spellcaster to use it? Okay. Well this Hat of Disguise, Percival, it requires some attunement. I don't know how capable you are with magical items. I can make us all into birds. What do we do in the week? Prepare. Recon? Wait, we're going to get cash and come back? And it won't take us a whole week to prepare for this party. All we need is a couple disguises. We could go do some recon. We should do some research, some reconnaissance while someone goes for the money. Listen, we could all go get the money and be back in four days, right? Split the party? By air, though. Check yourself, Kiki-- You, I would assume, use Polymorph as I do. Ooh. That's so sexy. Does that last for longer than a day? Damn! You can be an animal as long as you want? Well then, like me, flying there would not be an option. We'd have to stop, rest, walk, sleep. I'll come, too. I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia. Well put! Chief negotiator! As we walk, do we see Tiberius fly over our heads? Well, is Gilmore around? We'll just peruse, yeah. We'll window shop. I don't know. Unforced error. Sherri. If I may. What Keyleth was trying to say was that she never got a chance to go to college, and that she wanted to get that university experience. Well, that didn't work. Hey, can you serve me, now? I was wondering if you had a small box of some sort that could carry a magical item, and perhaps shield it from detection. I just need one. You're a woman of the world, and I'm sure you have fine taste, judging by your appearance. It is quite fine, if I may say so myself. If I were a little taller, I would probably ask you out on a date. Which one is the fancier of the two? Hm. I want ostentatiousness. Yes, please. That. Thanks. Thank you. 200 to you. Also, I know Gilmore is otherwise entertained. Can you try to identify something for me? Do you have that-- I mean, judging by the glint in your eye and beauty in your heart, I'm sure you have many skills I don't know about, but I'm wondering if you could identify this small, red vial with a floating something in it, that I procured quite some time ago! Do you remember that? Have I tried this, once before? Me and Pike found some stuff in somebody's house? I don't even remember, this was a year ago. A lot. Persuasion? It's 35. Wait, 31. 31. Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, thank you so much. Two more questions, then I'll leave you alone. One where can I go get business cards printed up, in this town? It's a calling card? Never mind! Forget it. Yes! Oh, great! Thank you; I'll go investigate that. And one other thing you know those books that my friend was asking about? Could we maybe make those happen for her? I know that you had quoted her a low, low price of 25. I'd be prepared to pay even more than that for them. And compose you a little song about yourself. So I have to pay you and sing to you? All right. I bring out my-- something. (laughter) Okay, here you go! Oh! Here you are. Oh, yes! How'd it go in there? You're walking straight, so it couldn't have gone too well. Well, let's get out of here and go. Did you find us any--? Let's get out of here, go back to the keep. Whoa, what? It was a necklace we're talking about? "Amulet of Natural Armor?" I'm flying, too? What's happening? I start falling. Would you rather just send Tiberius, then? That's all right. That's why we're taking the heaviest hitters. Oh. It's a spell? Let's go home and go to sleep. They live in the Underdark. There's no real time there. Krull? You went to the good one. She just thought bear. She just knows bear. Are we still waiting for him outside? When he comes out, I cast Minor Illusion to make it look like I have a long gray beard. (laughter) Any other stops you'd like to make? The dry-cleaners, perhaps? Oh, that's great. Now let's go night-night so you can cast a spell on us. It's a huge fart. Go in there and kill him. Kill him, shit on his bed, and leave. She's amazing. Let's get going. Does it shit on your shoulder? We want to get out of here. Cast the thing. Let's go. Still want to split the party? I jump in. Yes, I did. My old stomping grounds. Sure, don't worry. You will. How much? She's very fond of the carpet. She loves the hand-woven carpets. It's just very tragic. Yes, who's the man we need to see about that? Nostoc Greyspine? She's-- That time of the month. Well no, not all of us. If you'll recall there were more of us when we came down here. And some of us aren't here because they died. 21. So before you berate us, know that we are mourning the loss of two of our members. And a bear! Lots of illithid. A whole city of illithid. They were mind controlled. It was crazy, we're not just making this up. It really happened. At Gilmore's. I am going to cast Suggestion on him. I don't have my hand cone out. 17. I'm going to suggest to him that he is an honorable man and we had a deal. And that he should honor it, to the fullest extent of the word. I also, as a cantrip-- oh god, I hope it's not concentration. Forget it. I'm not going to. Remember the blood we spilled for your people and your safety. Oh! I go to give him a business card, but then I realize I never got them printed so. Yes, Gilmore's! If you're ever overdark, come check it out. It's a great store. Can you do it again? Don't you have to rest? I'm sorry. I must be asleep. Are you planning something? Ahead of time. Wow. That's amazing! Well, you've come to the right place. I do have quite a mouth. Yes, let's go talk to her. Wait, she's the woman you fancy quite a bit, isn't that true? What do you want to speak with her about? See? I told you it was a girl! Good job. We can pay back Gilmore. No, I don't, no. Just give us a quick stipend. Give us each 1,500 and let's move on. Let's go do our recon. Who's doing it? No, we're just going to go spy on them. Let's go do recon. We need to get into the Briarwoods' estate and talk to them. Where's the feast to be held? Yes, that might be very strange. Yes, even if you wear this disguise hat, Percy, how are you going to get into this event? It's a private event. You can't just be some random person. Yeah, but that's going to arouse all kinds of suspicion. Why don't you disguise yourself as-- What about Vax? He can sneak in. Ooh, Pike. You could be Pike. You would be a very big Pike. I can also do that. Or he can. No problem. I know it's a few days off, but we should have some sort of safe word. Some sort of attack word. Grog, any suggestions? (whistles) She gambles now. She's crazy. We don't even need that much. If you'd just said to kill someone, we'd probably do it. I went to get business cards. I'm going to get two sets. One says Scanlan Shorthalt, one says Burt Reynolds. Oh no. I'm going to give him inspiration for one of them. (singing) Do you want to build a machine gun? Inspiration, d10. Percy, that's amazing! What do you call it? Diplomacy? We'll need fancy robes. Not for very long. Grog, have you washed yourself in water at all this week? Well, are you in disguise yet, Percy? Cloaked Vax? I'm going to cast Invisibility on Vax. You've got one hour until my Invisibility is going to wear off, so find a shadow. Yes! We're friends here. Yes. He also has a bit of a cold. Sort of like sandpaper on a chalkboard. This is not Vax. We will be as quiet as a house mouse. However, if you need us to act, just utter the word "jenga." Who, me? Who, us? Keyleth, I hope you phoned ahead and gave them your order for a vegan meal. Let's go mingle. You walk away. I jump up and give him a little high five. Then, as an hour has passed, I beckon to Vax and find a shadowy area. Real Vax. Because my thing is wearing off, buddy. As we move, I release and then recast Invisibility on him when I see that there's a moment where everyone's distracted. I assume I sit at the kiddie table because I'm so tiny? I am risen already. I'm standing already. Yes. Oh, sorry. Lord Briarwood. Down here, hi. Lord Briarwood, we may share a mutual friend or acquaintance of some sort. My father was a prominent doctor, and he may have studied medicine with a fellow that you know named Dr. Ripulah, Ripley? Dr. Ripley? Do you know such a person? Are you close with her? She sounds wonderful. Well, when you see her next tell her that my father, Dr. Jeff Shorthalt, said hi. L'Chaim. Oh yes. Tiberius, get back here. No! Not every time! But enough about us. Earlier, you were telling us about a poor family that came down with that disease. I'm just curious, coming from a medical family. What was the disease that they had? Anyone care for some games of jenga? Wait, no, that's Uriel that's leaving. I play a little flute. (Star Wars Cantina song) Sylas or Delilah? Burn their room down. We've got to find Seeker Assam, or whatever his name is. Kill them. Oh wait, you're not invisible anymore. Jenga! Jenga! We had a safe word for a reason! Or just today, running off to the, to the sigil!
