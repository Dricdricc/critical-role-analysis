Featuring? Featuring? It's got a little bend in it for your butt! Hold it up a little higher so the people can see. She dropped it in a portapotty. Escorting this boy to his home. Little dead boy? Swing by his house, yeah. We had spaghetti for lunch. Do you know if they were hiding anywhere? If anyone else went anywhere specifically to hide? There is? Oh, oh, the refugees. South, north, northwest. South. Look for no trees. We're going to fight here? I thought we were going to do this out of town. I know someone. Yeah. Good day. Oh? Let's continue on. To Wilhand's. I'll explode the door! Damn it. Doors. Scanlan, Scanlan. I've written many a song about you, it's true. I'm okay, I'm okay for now. Pass the bottle. Is the kitchen even functional here? We do need time to rest and plan. They're great at one dish. I do! I'm quite successful as gnomes go, in fact, before we-- Should we make the mansion, get Wilhand a room, and then go to our last destination of this night before we turn in? Are we supposed to meet up with him later tonight? At dawn, we rise and make a plan! There's a house we're supposed to plunder. Yeah, I'm down. We've got 40 goliaths with us, this is the best time to attack. No? I'm alone here? Let's table it. All right. Let's get this man to safety and then we'll finish up our errands for the day, yes? What, who? Is he gone, is he dead? And uncle? All right, yes, I'll make the mansion. Your room is the one covered in rose petals. So I will cast the spell, I'll sit down and start humming. (singing) My house is a very, very, very fine house. With chickens everywhere. It used to be so fair-- I take him in, I show him to his room. Here, come with me. I take him upstairs, take him to his room. And before I bid him adieu I say later tonight we can discuss more, but I would like to ask for your granddaughter's hand in marriage. But I'll need your permission first. Well, it's a 20. But that's low for me. I call for five servants, and I instruct them to take him wherever he'd like to go and give him whatever he needs. Don't be cheap with the chicken! All right, so I scoot out back to rejoin our friends. Should we split the party and send a few people to pillage this house that we were instructed to pillage? But there was some talk of needing someone to take us through the sewers, and I can go fetch someone who knows the sewers. Well, or someone with him, yes. Sure. What are we doing? Where's Master Quall's-- --brick two-story house near the fountain? And hold it against a dragon? This is our battle, we're trying to kill these dragons! Two Vestiges, an army of 40 barbarians. We're going to have to make that plan at some point. I do have a Napoleon complex. No! We kill it and run. Because we know where the dragon is, we have an army, we have an opportunity, this is it. We're never going to have an army. And what if the machine fails? We need a plan that doesn't rely on technology, I'm sorry. If we have 40 goliaths throw 40 chains attached to-- Fine. 30 goliaths would throw 30 chains with 30 spikes on them at this dragon, I bet a few would hit. Yes, we are super powerful. They're strong, we're smart, let's do this. So what, we're never going to kill any of the dragons, then? Because that will happen at some point. And they won't react then? It's-- this is our mission, to kill these dragons. All right. If we find something cool, we kill the dragon. Can I assist you guys? Not with music, I'll send an invisible guy in there to start pressing on the floor and walls. Oi! This-- what? I don't even see what you're talking about. Oh! I would've totally missed that. (laughter) 13. Want to throw a pillow down there? Well, go get the pillow, try again. Not me, Pikey! Pike? Pike, you got any undo magicky things? You're my girl! I think so. If you're going to do this, I insist that we visually see it with the actual broom. (laughter) Ooh, good! Let's go down to the basement! There was nothing there, Vax. No, we were not going anywhere near the pressure points, by the way. I'm not going with them. No way, there are terrible bombs and stuff there. I'm going downstairs. Wait wait wait. Before you dispel the magic-- Maybe it's good, maybe that's how the key works? If you dispel the magic, maybe the key won't work anymore, I don't know. Is there magic on the key? Okay, dispel the magic, yeah, no that's good. Can I inspire her retroactively? I think it worked. Wait, I can have, I can have someone-- I can have someone turn the key, if that's what we're talking about. Then waah, we go kill a dragon instead. At dawn, we discuss! At dawn! Can Unseen Servant carry a key, or is it more Mage Hand-y? I'll do Unseen Servant, named Mort. He's right in front of you! Don't be rude to Mort! Oh. Mort. Take the key. I have to wait six seconds. All right. Mort. Open the door with the key. Would've burned us! Ah, he's fine, yeah? He's fine. Oi! Sure, I'll come. Yes. Mort. Join me. Okay. All right, let's go pillage! I'll start looking around and looting. Five. Ahh, it's beautiful. Don't you have some ability that you can find magical objects? We made this thing? Wow. Should I go upstairs and get Grog, just in case things get ugly? Keyleth, don't you have something that he gave us? Oi, did she pick it up already? Didn't kill us? Well, that's good. Did it wake up the beast? Of course I'm not going to break it! I'll have Mort hold it. Mort! We're okay, we're okay. Oh, come on, don't demean him. He doesn't have a mind. Well, we have a killing machine now. Can only creatures go in your locket thing? Well, probably only creatures. He doesn't have a mind. Fassbender. Too hunky? Ahh, dammit. Oh, if only I had any. Sorry, we met somebody who's even stronger and awesomer than you. But we still love you and we'll bring him out to meet you soon. You can do a pocket fisherman instead. Wait! Oh no, he's not a creature. I can't make him invisible. Oh. Any magic. I could try to make him invisible. It says creature. I am fully attuned. We can try this in the mansion. If we can get him through the door. I'll try to turn him invisible. I don't think it'll work, though, but-- Hey, that's great, all right, let's get outta here then. He's wider than the stairs. Because we're going up the staircase! Are you still unclear about whether we should kill this dragon or not? We have a killing machine now! It doesn't matter. He can catch it with his hand! Yeah, yeah! However, him plus a bunch of other people could probably hold the dragon. Why don't we have him smash through it? Who cares? We don't live here. Your arm gets torn off. Ooh, you're stronger than the thing! You don't have hair up there. Absolutely. Wait, wait, before we go. I want to go find my daughter. I've got to leave. Sorry. Bye. Bye! Yeah, I got to go. Sorry. Yeah. I do. I'd like Vax to come. Talk, you can start the talk without me, it'll be fast. I do want to, and bye. I'm going to where I dropped her off at the sewers. And I'm hoping that he can track or something? Fuck! I don't know what you people can do! (laughter) Okay, Vax. I know that you are an expert tracker. Right? Wait, you're not the one? Yeah, I know, aren't you the tracker guy? I don't know, don't you move in the night and do things? Can we go in the sewer and see if we can figure out where they went? They went down here and they went towards the city wall, that's all I know. Okay. Well, I can't lift anything. Whoop! Natural 20. (cheering) C'mon, pull your weight, man! Yes they are. Years of use. All right. Where do we go? D'you need an article of her clothing for a scent? There were some humanoids, humans with us. We were traveling with a bunch of people. You are the expert. Shit. Seven. I'm just excited! Huh! 19! Okay. I'm always quiet! Oh. Okay. Can we go around it? Can I sense which direction the wall of city is, like do I have any sort of-- Survival, I've never done this before! 13. Oh! I-- let's go that way! (whispering) Sorry, let's go that way. All right. What? How do you know that? Oh. Oh, good! Out of town, get out of town. No sign of tracks, anyone huddled for safety? Pff. Ten. Balls. That's true. All right. All right. Sorry, wild goose chase. No, no. I just don't know when I'll see her again, so. I'll find her again. That's all. It'll be good. Yeah. Oh, and hey. Thank you. Back at the sphinx. Your sister was unconscious, and you dove in to save me. That was very nice. Because you love me? Well, I owe you one. Forever. And I hate to say it, but I feel terrible about it, but I think I might've killed a couple of civilians because I feel like I owe you some, some help. Well, I was in the big fight back there, I could've hurt you or the civilians, but I decided to hurt the civilians, because I've got to protect you, because you protected me. All right. Next time. Well, I'm no ranger like you. (laughter) Through the sewers again? All right. I'll lead the way. Indoors, by the way. Hey now. Rangers aren't very strong. Death's eye. Oh my god. Oh. That's Slow. He's talking to a whale right now somewhere. --your eyes start to bleed. I'm not there. You'll have to butter me up first. Ahh. I'll go down and check on things downstairs. Maybe? I don't really remember things like that. Bracers of Defense, what do they do? I wear armor, so I could trade them for something cool? I wear Cold Snap Leather Armor. At dawn, we chit-chat! We'll send a carefully worded letter. We can't roam the city for days trying-- looking for some dead guy's daughter, come on. Well then we should go bust her out! Should we sleep first? And go at dawn? What time is it? Wake his ass up. That's you, Pike. Listen, we have this Herd. They will be our allies for exactly one day. In theory. So if we do not use them to attack dragons, can we at least use them to do something? Because they will no longer ever be our allies again after today. We could use them to go try to kill the dragon on their own, we could use them to try to kill something or someone else for us, we could use them to try to help clear the city, if we convinced them that it was in their best interest to-- 'This'? You know, we're all gathered here together, so I'd like to take this opportunity with Wilhand's blessing to propose marriage to you, Pike Trickfoot. Will you make me the happiest gnome ever? I'm sorry, I couldn't contain myself any longer. I know, I'm sorry, I've been thinking about it all night tonight, I went looking for Kaylie, she wasn't there, and then-- I'm sorry, I blurted it out, it's just, we're all together, we're never all together like this, so. I know, I know, but we may die later tonight when we go see Zanror. You know what, don't answer now, don't answer now. I know that you want to say yes, but please, don't answer yet. Just think about it and we'll talk about it some other time. All right. No no no, I'm sorry, that didn't, I didn't do that the way I had planned it in my head, I'm sorry. I was overcome with a lot of stress, you know? We're fighting dragons and bonding with goliaths here and you're in my house, and it's a very very stressful night for me, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. For sure. You know what, we'll table it. We'll table it. We'll table it. I think he's in the kitchen. Yeah, I'm fine. She didn't say no? Oh, yes. I just don't know where she is, so it's a bit stressful. That's all. She's safe though, right? Just say yes. Yeah, I thought so. We're going to try to convince them to delay. If they won't delay, then we say, all right, let's go fight, and we send them into battle. You don't have to answer now. No, it's fine, I was, it was, I was impetuous and silly and I don't know sometimes, I get hamhanded around you-- I'm very smooth with everybody else, I don't know what it is. Yes? Yes? But you can't, you're like a priest or something, you can't lie! I don't know, I-- There was personal stuff in there! You do? Really. Well, we've almost died a few times very recently. My body? What are you t-- you sound like me, you're stammering and babbling like I was! We should just marry then! I don't know either! It's a very strange relationship. Okay, fine. No, you said it! You said it! You can't joke about that stuff with me! I don't even know what's going on right now! Thank you for clarifying?! (laughter) This is not how I thought tonight was going to go! I feel betrayed, I feel let down, I feel so horny right now! Oh, come on, Pike! Listen. Everything I said in that letter I meant. And regardless of whether or not you totally betrayed me by reading it, I'm glad that you at least understood the sentiment, I hope? And appreciated my honesty and the fact that you are taking that vow? If I die. Yes, I understand. Well then, that's fine. That's all I need. No, I know, I didn't know why I proposed, that's stupid. I love you! I'm sorry? I think we both are? Anyway. Thank you for telling me the truth after you sort of lied to me, so-- --oh, I know, but all right. Anyway. Thank you for this-- sort of. I guess I have to go to my room and think about this while I stare at my picture in the mirror above my bed. It's just a mirror. (laughter) Sleep tight. I kick the dirt a little bit and then I walk away and I click my heels. Little jump-and-click. Should we leave a couple outside or anything or no? Shit. Well, certainly not with the cowards who're abandoning you in the face of a tough fight. I'm dead. That's not very nice. Well, I'm just a guest here, so I don't want to spill anyone's blood in someone else's throne room, so I'll be the bigger man and take a step back. Maybe we should just let them leave. Saves. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of being called tiny. Listen, I don't want to-- Oi! Forget it, guys, why are we trying-- Why are we trying to convince this asshole to fight with us? Let's just let him leave, he's a coward. Does that include your wife? Or someone. He might need it. Episode title! Barack is here? What's that mean?
