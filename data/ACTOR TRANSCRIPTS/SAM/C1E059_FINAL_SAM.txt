Loot Anime? Wait, we all have to have anime reactions to these. This is definitely a Captain America shirt. Guys, one more quick announcement, over here on the cool table. Joe Mad posters. You know them, you love them, they're up on shop.geekandsundry.com. It's your last chance to preorder the unsigned limited edition Critical Role poster. The poster size it's not 23 by 35, it's 24 by 36. We went the extra inch for you guys. These posters will be removed from the website and deleted forever tomorrow at 100pm Pacific. The cost is $40. Go buy it now. Sorry, Taliesin. Let me try that again. It's the extra inch, cubed. That's a very half-hearted plug, Matt. Where are we? I'm hanging back with Grog. I've been scratching my back on his knee for a while. We should test it out. If there was a naked woman, I would have seen it. Go on. He kicked the sword. All right, which way did she go? Should we follow? Did you recognize the hand? Why don't you call out her name? O Nymph! Hear my call! Nope, call. Once, we spent an afternoon together. The sun never shone brighter. The clouds were never quite as fluffy. Oh, it would make me a man again to see you once more. It's her! Is it because I owe you two gold? Okay, here it is! Well, you cockblocked Grog a little bit. (whispering) She fucked her, too. Of course we remember that thing that happened when we were drunk two and a half years ago. (laughter) Maybe you're just this way now, and your other senses will get better. Duskward? That's west. We'll be moving on before then. Have you heard anything of this bow or this tree? Is there anything specifically we should avoid? Specific plants, colors? Before we set out. You've told us what to be wary of everything. Is there anyone out there we can trust if come across them? She's talking to you. Percy, at this point. How many of us can you embolden? No, don't sell yourself short. You're great. Grog, carve your name in him. All right, Pike. Do your thing. (stage whisper) Pike, if you do this thing that you're going to do, will it take away his Barkskin, too? People! We're tearing ourselves apart in the Feywild. Let Pike get rid of this blind spot so we can all be together again. Do you need inspiration, Pike? Perception check? Oh, ten. Two dusks' travel. That could be years. Just the men. Which direction? I didn't know a nun could curse like that. No, thanks. I'll ride Grog. I wish Nala had cast Blindness on me. (laughter) We still haven't hit that tree line? What about this? Keyleth, can't we move through the trees? Just grass? What if this is a week's journey? What if this is two weeks' journey? She said two dusks south. What if this is a month? Should one of us circle back and make sure that no one's behind us? All right, then we're going to keep going, and I'll keep reading my book on top of Grog. Press on? Don't forget your hat! This is the anticipation that you feel before you open a Loot Crate! Not knowing what it could be. Could it be good? Could it be bad? What you do know is that it's $3 off if you use the code criticalrole. Grog, grab him! Don't talk to him. Squeeze him. I'll step forward and put my hand on his shoulder and say Listen. On his toe, then. I'll say Listen, little man. I'm little, too, and you have nothing to fear from us as long as you cooperate. I will cast Suggestion on him, and I will suggest that he fully cooperate with us and tell us all he knows. Well, I didn't use the hand cone, did I? So 18. Tell us. Can we open the book? He's a little shithead! Don't kill him, Grog! Art is subjective. Should we make camp here and invite him into the mansion? All right. He's got seven dicks. We can fix it for him. Well, not go. Just put him down. Are we making camp here? Should we get in the house? I'll cast the mansion. I'll sit down and sing (singing) My house is very, very, very fine house! With chicken everywhere! Life used to be so fair, but now it's better because of me! (laughter) Press release? I like a nicely poached animal. I put 20 guards on him. Yeah, there's carpet, but we have beds. What do we want to know from this little twerp? We want you to take us to this place, this mirk place. Don't worry, the servants will get it. It's terrible because of what dwells there, or because of the place itself? What dwells there? Which page? No, we're taking him. We're taking him as far as we can. We need guides who know the land. One of us is a member of a thieves' guild. Quid pro quo? Or we could kill you here. We could kill him. We have a powerful position in negotiation. I'm a master negotiator. Who's getting whispered to? Percy? Percy goes blind again. Every five minutes. A roll and a re-whisper. This is crazy. He just said the C-word, the F-word, the G-word! Are you going to fix his what-is-it-called? I will inspire Percy by singing. (singing) Go ahead, Percy, and fix his ocarina! Take your tinkering tools and fix his ocarina! You go, Percival, you can fix his ocarina! Good lie, Grog. Who's he shaking? Sounds nice. I love the theater! Just in general, the theater? I do an insight check. I don't know what I have. Terrible. 13. We do nothing but trust you. The Slayer's Take. Hey, Keyleth. You've got magic. I don't entirely trust this thing. We were told specifically not to trust anything. Do you have any spell that can do true-seeing, or that can restore him if he's putting on this form, or that can dispel some charm that he has around him or some aura? Pikey, do you have something that can reveal some truth or dispel magic from him? The hat is not magic. You can leave that on. Wait. I think I can do something. I can sing a song. That's mostly what I do, if you haven't noticed by now. I have a power that I never ever use. It's called Countercharm. I can counter charms. I stayed up all night reading. I have to. No, I slept last time. I think it was 48 hours of reading over a period of six days. Yeah. I'm on day four, I believe. And I'm up to 36 hours now, if this counts as ten, 12 hours. ASHLEY and Yes? I knew it! I suspected it! That's why I tried to use Countercharm, but I don't know how to use it. (laughter) Anyway. What do you think we should do? Wait. When were you charmed? What did it affect? What decisions did you make today that were key? Well, we can always back out on the deal. What, is there some sort of blood pact that we made? What does mean? You and I could go down to his room right now and kill him and be done with it. Would we be cursed? Haunted forever? Oh man. That sucks. I don't want to be haunted. That's for you and Vax! (laughter) No baggage, man, no baggage. What do we do? We made a deal with a devil of some sort. Is there a way to trick the trickster into releasing us from the deal? Because, you know, I'm a sly talker. Now I've got to read about the fucking fey, too. (quietly) She's naked in a hat. It's Leonardo and Winslet. ASHLEY and Who changed my-- oh, I look pretty good. I think we all look normal, actually. That's how I see us, sure. Why don't you pet his legs again, weirdo? Sounds good to me. So we can still kill him? Performance check? You're definitely the right person to be doing this. Wait, hey. This is my house. What? The Macarena? You're really good at it. Thank you. I will try my best. Let's go to the city. I think we're going to be sneaking in to steal things. How long will it take to get to the city from where we are? I'm not. I'm reading. That's exciting. Should we attack? What does that even mean? Vessar? Vax and Vex Vessar?
