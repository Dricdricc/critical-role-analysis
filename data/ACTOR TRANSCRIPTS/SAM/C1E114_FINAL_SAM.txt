Marvel Puzzle Quest has epic news, guys! They're celebrating four years strong, starting today! Today, it's literally the only thing on my mind. When I heard that Rogue and the other X-Men are kicking off the celebration, I was like, "Vecna who?!" Forget that an immortal psychopath will probably wipe out three years of hard work on this show! Give me Marvel Puzzle Quest! Today, October 5th, is a big day. Not because we're facing the ultimate harbinger of doom who will surely cut short our lives and story, no, but because, in 11 days, on October 16th-- until then-- Marvel Puzzle Quest gives you free gifts! Double XP rewards, including the all-new X-men versus Apocalypse event, which is the only event I'm thinking of, and the only event that kept me awake last night in a cold sweat until 400am. A cold sweat of excitement for Marvel Puzzle Quest! Did I mention that you can recruit Gambit for the first time? I'm not crying inside anymore! Did I also mention Nightcrawler is coming later this month? Nightcrawler, who can teleport around and isn't frozen with fear, contemplating his inevitable demise two hours from now, at the hands of a one-eyed master of hell who will destroy everything and everyone we've loved! So download Marvel Puzzle Quest now for free on Apple and Android devices because I'm so happy! How far are we from the entry to this chamber, or whatever? When we get 20 feet away from it, 15 feet away from it, I'm going to cast Unseen Servant and hand him my whip. Tell Scanlan Two buddy, I need you, but not right away. When this whip falls, come in the room. I believe in you, buddy. I've always believed in Number Two. I love you, buddy. We shake hands. Why can't we hear you? What's that? What does that do? Wait, Matt's correcting you. Why haven't we always used this? Eight. It's so simple and beautiful. What is that thing in the middle? I'll be next to Grog. Guard that entrance. This is fine. What! Oh man, he looks so cool. Can I inspire myself for this roll? Yeah, but I don't have a turn. Eight. Unless I can inspire myself. I mean, I'm not going to get anywhere higher in the order. Hey, I think he's looking pretty rough. With advantage. Natural 20. 26. Ones are an automatic fail, twenties are not successes, right? DC. It's a plus what now? Charisma? I mean, there's no way we can beat the amount of damage he did. 27. The whip falls to the floor. What does that mean? It sunders the tower? But that map was so pretty. How did you make that? How did you build that thing? No. Saving throw at advantage. What, why? So Holy Aura's gone? That was fun. It saved us a bunch of points of damage, though. How does he make love? (laughter) Wait, can your thing still-- 12. Great. Awesome. Should I roll initiative for the guy in the hallway? Okay, 16. Everything is reckless at this point. Is she like in his chest cavity? I know you do, but do we as players care about this girl? Yeah. I'm falling, right? Yeah, but gets me out of commission for a round. I'm inspired. Probably five. Oh my God. Nine times! That will do it. He's going to, if there's a path up-- Is he in a place where he can climb, or no? Seven? Plus four. 11. Shit. I want to do so much other than try to hang onto the floor at this point. Shit. I guess he'll inspire himself. Wait, roll and add two? Oh, well that just makes it 14. Hi. Where is my friend, Scanlan One? Great. In that case-- Sure, great, yeah, of course it is. And his bonus action. Inspire. You tell me, friend. But it does cost me an inspiration. Shit. There's barely anything I can do. Yeah, I can do so much. I don't see anything that's going on. I'm going to make an attack on the guy, because that's all I know how to do. On the big man. The god. I'll do-- shit, I can't do that. I'll do a Lightning Bolt at level five. I don't know that. Do I know that? Would I know that? So Scanlan Two would know this. Well in that case, I will do a Fireball. Yes, it's using five charges from the Fireball. Oh! No, can't do that. Doesn't have the wand. Never mind! Then in that case, he's going to do Bigby's Hand! Right under his chin, and it's going to punch him. Oh, he has a wand! Okay. 17 plus 11. 28. Bigby's Hand. Shit. It's 4d6? Yeah. They're all bad. 12 points. Oh shit. One. Oh no. Oh wow. Okay. Okay, bonus action. Who am I near? Am I near Keyleth? Can I inspire Keyleth? Is she close enough to me? I will inspire Keyleth. I will sing (singing) 25,677 minutes. Ask Critical Role Stats if you don't believe me. 25,677 minutes. That's how long we've been playing. Playing this game. Yes, it is. I am going to reaction Counterspell at 8th-level. Yes. Scanlan will say Ooh! Look what you made me do. You made me screw up you. You made me screw up you and now you have to do brand new. (laughter) I'm sure it's going to be not good. Yes! Get that fucking god. That's a powerful spell. He'll use that legendary resist. Two? I thought it was three? No? Oh yeah, reroll those ones! Ooh! He's rolling. (gasps) You're back. How did she get hurt that bad? Oh, she took the full thing. Does he take only magical damage? It's now or never. How do you want to do this? (laughter) 19. Damage? Okay. I don't know. I have no good options. Nothing. Of course I can save myself, but I'm trying to do more than just save myself. (sighs) I'm going to. (fanfare) I'm going to inspire myself. Yes. I'll start singing to myself. This is a stupid idea. I'll inspire myself, I'll sing (singing) I give inspiration, it's just what I do. Every time they try to knock me down I just get bold. I give inspiration, every time I do. Every time I open up my mouth it comes out gold. Oh no. I'm just giving myself inspiration in general. You can't do that?! Oh fuck. Well in that case, forget it. I don't do that at all. Do I see anyone? Or can I inspire anyone from my distance? Well then, forget it, I don't do that. Shit balls. I can't do shit! I will Dimension Door to his chest. Not inside the chest, I would be hanging on the outside. Yeah. Bonus action. Am I within range of any of my friends to inspire them? Vex. How you looking? You looking rough? Okay. Then I will sing that same song but as a Healing Word instead. 2nd-level. Okay. And what is it? 2d4 plus six. 11 points. Oh! Okay. So I've just landed on his chest. I look in there and there's no girl in there anymore. Shit. Do I see Bigby's Hand? Do I have enough movement to get to it? Would I go out of melee range of this guy? Would he get an attack of opportunity? Okay. I'll grab that thumb instead. (laughter) Yeah, I'm good. Oh no. This might be the happiest day of my life. But still alive. Who can she affect? We're all going to die. Wait. Have you gone yet? Liam, have you gone yet? Did you do anything? They're okay. They're okay. It was the yearly bounce house festival. (laughter) That's not good. Is this a spell? Scanlan One is going to Counterspell this. I don't recognize this spell? 20. Would I know what level to spell-- Seven. 22. Gulp. Can I hold onto Bigby? I wish to let him leave while I hold onto Bigby. And get my attack of opportunity. (laughter) Am I within melee range to make a Mythcarver attack? I would like to let the spirit of the sword overtake me. This is only a reaction? So a single attack. Then I will use my War Caster ability to cast Bigby's Hand at level six and I will say, you leave when Burt Reynolds says you can motherfucking leave. (cheering) Right on his fucking head. If he's flying up, I want him to go boop! All right. So this is 6th-level. 4d8 becomes 6d8, right? Oh, roll to hit. Shit. Ooh, no! It's a two. Plus 11 is not going to hit. No, no. I've done so much this turn. 6th-level gone, 7th-level gone. Ready. That's smart. And then spend the rest of my turn eating mayonnaise. (laughter) Guys, of all of us, I'm the one who's flying right now. Should not be this way. Wait, what did you do? Do we have to? It's an illusion, just let her go. We're literally playing three dimensional chess, right? Oh! Four daggers. The book. What if it's just Lady Chatterley's Lover or something? Aw shit. So what was your total damage? No, no. I just didn't hit him. It's okay. I have no more reactions, right? We're still in the same round. That's cocked. What's that? What was it? That was pretty cocked. Oh, you're inspired! Matt does not like that. Sure. Oh, shnikes. Four?! Is that 56 points of damage, that's with no save? I don't know what my dex is. I'm looking. AC, dexterity of ten, so he rolled a 15. Did not. So he lost some points. But he has my hit points? What does he have? I'm looking, I'm looking. Sorry. I got it, you go on with your thing. Okay. So he's still alive. I have no reaction, right? It hasn't come back to me? Yes. As Wish. Including me. He died as he lived making the world a little bit wetter. Can the audience even see me right now? Okay. 14 points of damage does not make me lose concentration, right? Okay. What was the first hit that we took? How many points? The golden snitch. You just took a drink and you're back. It really is. Bigby's Hand is still near him? Bigby's Hand will attack and strike. Two. That's my bonus action. Can I use my action to strike again? I have to do something else. That's fine. Hey, question, before we go on. Earlier, you said something, when Ashley did something, and you said, "And when anyone heals in the future, it's a "plus ten," or something. What was that? So when she heals anyone-- 75, so I can't even hit him with anything, really. She's a planetar? I turn into a giant eagle. And I'll fly Grog up. Polymorph, on myself. I stand up using half my movement. Yeah. I don't know how far they can fly. I'm sure it takes time to get under him and stuff. Oh, he's Enlarged. He's engorged. So it was-- So it's 40. Next round I can get close. No, no, that's fine. I mean, Bigby's Hand couldn't have moved down and gotten Grog and gone back up, right? Sure. So Bigby's Hand's gone. Ooh, he wants to hold on. (singing) Hold on to your love-- Up what hole? Up the butt? Marvel Puzzle Quest! Heal some shit! Remember, Scanlan is heading up towards you now as an eagle. But we are within range of you. You can heal yourself if you're down. Against what? 26 hit points. (laughs) Right? It's what it says. How many meteors? Eagle rolled a ten. We're going to need you, Pike. What are the two types of damage? I'm dead. I had a hundred points as me, and one point as an eagle. Oh god. What? No! No bonus actions? You can't pour anything in my mouth? I don't know. Is that right, Matt? Because you won't get any bonuses once you hold your action. He probably can concentrate on more than one thing. No? I don't know. And attack? Bonus action? Shit. Do I try to Counterspell this? Then can I do Cutting Words? Is it a melee attack? Probably 60 feet. That misses. Great! That was fast! Don't keep us in suspense for too long! Took three rolls and a bonus. Pass me that not bottle of alcohol. There's a plan. Percy's building a ladder. All he needs is a wood shop and about 25 minutes. Oh no. It's something else. We saw you die! Put on the hurt. Yeah! You're up to 20. You're at 32. Matt, our young lady over here would like to bonus action something. Oh, double hex? He's already hexed? All right, double hexed. And yours is up. Wait, what? We're getting farther apart? God, so many levels. Oh! Wand of Fireballs can get him, right? I could hit above him. I will stand up. Who's near me? Is Pike within inspiring range, or--? Oh wait, actually-- I'll use five of my seven Fireball charges. Well it starts at three, and that uses one charge. So four, five, six, seven. Is that my spellcasting--? No, it's a DC 15. It saves. Shit, and it's 8d6, 9d6, 10d6, 11d6, 12d6! But halved. Okay, 14, 25, that was good. 40. Yep, and I'll call out, I need a lift! I will bonus action 2nd-level Healing Words myself. Oh, terrible. Okay, so I get another ten points. That's it! I can't Counterspell his Counterspell? But I'm not too far away from her? But that's not how it works, okay. All right, Pike, divvy it up. I need more than a hundred. How does this work, Matt? Does she know all this inherently? And Vecna's also back to full. Right? She's really nice. Wait, is he freezing the wyverns or the-- She did have a reaction! Can she use a reaction? It can do anything, human or monster. What baby?! What just happened! Three of us! Oh, oh, oh! I would like to know his wisdom stat, please, Matt. That's what we have to beat with our trammels. It's a DC ten, plus five for each divine trammel. Yes. Plus ten. Wait. So the trammel is a DC ten, plus five for each trammel fused to the target. So he's got a plus ten to save. Assume that he's going to roll at least a ten. So we have to get all three in. At least two. Wait, is that the stat I should have asked for? I think, right? And if we get three in him, 75% chance? And you've got to assume that he's got some feat that can get him a ten whenever he wants, right? Critters, we love you. Thanks for watching the show. We barely do 50 hit points a round! Dang. Unless he can halve it or something. What?! Telekinesis? What's he doing? What does that do? That moves things, right? What's on there? What's that going to do? Yeah, but you just gave damage to Vecna, right? Did he maintain his concentration, Matt? What is he going to do with that thing? Does it smell like Taryon? Does he have Hunter's Mark or anything? Oh god, so he needed ground. Damn. Any sort of advantage? Nine! That's not so bad, right guys? So what is that, total? Everybody? Are you going to use it to kill me, Matt? 32 hit points. I cannot protect against that. I have no Counterspell that reaches him. Right? That hits. Great. Doesn't have Teleport? Nope. That hits. 14. I'm at three. No, it doesn't! Bro-barians. Super far from the guy. (whispers) That's what he calls his dick! Can you throw anything? Cast anything? There's also a bunch of pop-up undeads around us if you want to mop them up. You got any healing, you got any bonuses, you got anything? 13. Yeah. Freedom of Movement. Wait. He's grappled? He's immune to grapple. Is that a-- LIAM and That's a crit! That's a critical roll? Trammel that shit. Oh shit! I've had advantage on all saving throws this whole time and I haven't been using it. From the Blessing of the Knowing Mistress! That wouldn't have been any better. Oh! Is that necrotic? What is it, bludgeoning? How much were necrotic? You get a plus four on something, right? Ooh, that's a lot! Pat Planetar. This guy's getting hurt! Don't worry, he's going to die in that surround anyway. Yeah, sure. 4d4? That'll do great. Is it organic? I'm up? Who's near me? Can I inspire Pike? I don't know what she's planning on doing, but I'm hoping it's something to help me. What? I will inspire you. I guess for my bonus, I should take a healing potion. For my bonus, I'll take a superior healing, which is what? 8d4? It's too much to roll. 25. That's a lot! You said 33? What was I at before? One. I was at one. Am I prone or anything? I'm about to get hit by a goblin or something, aren't I? I'll hold my action until after Pike's turn. Otiluke's Resilient Sphere, at level five. On me. I have to stay alive. Who's near me? What's that? What do we add? She rolls. From New York. This is a 3,000 mile-- Is she playing with lasers because it's the future? Remember when Mary and Will were here? How much? My action is triggered. I'm in a ball, and I'm pushing against it so I don't roll off the edge. I don't know. I don't know how balls work. I've never seen a show. We have bars down here? Give Matt a couple. Man, this fight is crazy. Go, Philip! Liam, thanks for introducing me to Dungeons & Dragons. I'm beginning to like it. (whispering) He doesn't know what to do. He has level ten spells. Yeah, can't move. Yeah, because he can heal! No way. That's going to be a lot of damage. Scanlan is going to hold his action. That is the sound of the craziest bat house ever. Mine is a big fat zero around me, because I'm protected. Sorry, guys. Can't save you. Oh wow. That Finger of Death. It's the worst! Come on, ranger. Be a ranger. Responsibility? What responsibility? We're all carefree Joes and Jills here, right? Is J'mon doing macrame in there? Don't worry, it can resist anything! (screams) I feel so naked. Great. Burn those spells. I take off my hat and gladly accept the fire. I'm alive. Who moved? Oh, the stones moved? Sure, man. Bring it. Yes, Arkhan! I was a guest at Archon once. Pretty good convention. Okay. You're strong. When Grog attacked with the trammel, it was a strength check? We had two bards. What do you think? It looks close. I don't know, though. Triple digits? Oh shit, Marisha's trying for this one? It's a critical roll. (groaning) Even with the plus four? No. We're down to one. Bonus action. Do you want to do anything? Do you want to heal? Bigby's Hand. Bigby's Hand, level five. Lift me up, inspire Grog. That's it. That's my action. We need to get the last trammel in. I'm going to go up near Pike, and I'm going to inspire Grog. That's it. I'm going to sing (singing) Sunday, Monday, Sarenrae! Tuesday, Wednesday, Sarenrae! Thursday, Friday, Sarenrae! Sarenrae! She's my bae! Praying all week for you! Relay race. Oh, but I Counterspelled it at 8th-level. Ooh! (laughter) That's really good. 28. Half damage. Alive! No. 14. May I do a cantrip on her? Minor Illusion, just to turn her skin green. (laughter) Exalted. Exalted form. The hat. The broom. Hands shoved in each other's crotches. Not great. 15. I have negative two wisdom. I do. Why do you think I make stupid decisions all the time? Do I maintain concentration? But I'm a fox. What do I say? I'm a fox. Wow, that's terrible. Foxes can totally talk and cast spells, though, right? Wow, that's shitty. That's a shitty low-level spell use, Matt Mercer. (laughter) Polymorph is. But I don't actually know if that's what he used. Why do I have written down constitution? Well, I'm wrong. I assume fox will not survive very long. You might have to dagger-dagger-dagger me. At the end of the night, it's going to be up in the rafters! 21. Everything's breaking. Pike broke. Pike straight-up broke. Right, the first roll was a nine, right? The first roll I did was a nine? It was nine, yeah. Here, we'll work on it while you DM. We've got it. Give it over here. Did Pike give the trammel already? She still has it? Halved? What kind of damage? Come on, roll big. You got this, friend. No, you don't got this. Two and a three? 62. Keyleth, I can take care of myself. I can't get any superglue to come out of this shit. I've been biting on it. I've been doing all kinds of shit to it. We need a knife. I need a knife or scissors. It's okay. It's the last episode. Me? Oh shit, that's actually great! My turn? I've already inspired Grog. I'll hold for Pike. I'm going to hold the book! And I will inspire Pike. I'll inspire Pike, yeah. I will sing to her (singing) She's a good girl. (groaning) (singing) Loves her Scanlan. You aren't going to use your inspiration? All right, whatever. Wow, this is the fucking craziest game ever. It's midnight. Marvel Puzzle Quest! Do I have a reaction? Is it worth it? Okay. I'll Counterspell. Nine. That was going to save Vax. I'm sorry, Liam. Sorry, bud. 22. As in, don't use the book? As in don't kill him. The two trammels are in? He has one more legendary save. Is someone before me? I'm fine. 106. I'm fine. What you got, girl? Grapple and pull him down. You have no spells that don't do damage? Nothing that holds, nothing that silences? Nothing that feebles? Not as Keyleth? We can always bring you back. Chapter One The rites of banishment are ancient and powerful. They cannot be stopped by anyone, not even a god. I read. I read powerfully and strong. Someone needs to cast a 3rd-level spell on it. I can't read it, but other people can? I did that. Is Pike-- No, she's divinely-- Wait. Is anyone else? I cast my bonus action inspiration on Keyleth. (singing) Here's the story. Of a lovely druid. Who thought she could fly as a goldfish. But she couldn't, and she became fish paste. And I wish I had Wish. I'll cast Counterspell. Three. 30. I'm charisma as fuck! (laughter) First roll two. Second roll 18. Not good. Not good, both. 18. Do what you've got to do. So hit him 50 points, Grog. Roll high. You made this world, Matt. You have to name the action. Nothing. Bigby's Hand is gently tickling my taint. (laughter) Can J'mon catch anyone? Yeah. I go up to Vax. Palm over to him. You trained us all. TALIESIN and Yep, we did. "Those of you who are still with us?" It's fucking everybody. Everyone was clutch. Pike. Keyleth for the win. The most wisdom she's ever had. (laughter)
