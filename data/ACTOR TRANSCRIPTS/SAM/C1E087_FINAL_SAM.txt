-- is today's sponsor. A leading publisher of science fiction and fantasy for over 30 years. That's almost as old as I am. Do you like magic? Pirates? Knives? Royals and adventure? Then check out Shades of Magic, the series from Tor Books. The conclusion of which, A Conjuring of Light, was just released, so check out the full three-book series. Go to, there's a promo link somewhere on this page-- I'm gonna say right there. Let's say right there. So check that out. And the thing about sponsors, guys, is we really need to show them our love. And really show them that we appreciate what they do for us every week. They're a big part of the show, without them we would-- For instance, without sponsors, Taliesin would only be able to dye his hair platinum blond or brown. Yeah. Laura's dice budget would go way down. Instead of throwing away 250 dice a week, it would maybe be more like 240, 230. I mean, Liam might have to go back to shaving his beard and selling the beard shavings to those in need. I have just a few ideas for ways that you guys could show your love for our sponsors. Take them out for a candlelit dinner. I'm not talking Bennigan's, I'm talking something high-end. Shake Shack, Outback, maybe even P.F. Chang's. How about sending some romantic texts to spice things up? Keep it classy, like Hey, Critical Role Sponsor, I wish you could be with me right now. Or, I had a dream last night, and Critical Role Sponsor? You were in it. And hey, compliments always help. Critical Role Sponsor, do you have a map? 'Cause I'm getting lost in your eyes. Or Hey, Critical Role Sponsor, of all the beautiful curves on your body, I'm most in love with your smile. Or even Critical Role Sponsor, on a scale of one to ten, you're a nine, and I'm the one you need. Or you could just go to their website and buy their products. (all cheer) They were homeschooled, okay? Did you just say Jesus for everybody? That's someone snoring. (all laugh) Lots of push-ups, trying to beef up my pecs. I also, at the start of every day, I'm going to take two of those-- I have a bunch of silver coins that I carry around with me, and I'm gonna cast a couple of spells into them, just to have them at the ready. I cast Fly into one and Blur into the other. And then I would probably wander down to good old Percy, and just ask him if he needs help with any tinkering. He's in the back of the ship. (all laugh) I was, but I came up too. Hi, hello, hi. I have one of those little sticker things you put on the back for motion sickness. (all laugh) Hi, good day, good day, all. Good day, hi, hi. That's it. (all laugh) I turn to Doty, and I say, take this down. With an efficiency and an effective leadership role model for everyone, the redhead continues to propel us forward, faster and faster, to everyone's surprise and respect, including the captain. As the salt licks my nose, and the sweet smell of adventure is in the air, I know that with her on our side, we will be strong and we will be protected. End of chapter. You're amazing. Yes you are, ahoy! (hearty laugh) Delightful! First player death. Meanwhile, Whitestone burns. (all laugh) Any hand action going on? Protocol. I can communicate with semaphore if that's something you'd like me to do? It's communication with flags. It's a primitive communication technique that I learned in many of my studies, boat-to-boat it's really helpful. I pull out a couple of pieces of fabric and start gesturing-- Well, you just said to announce ourselves, I could announce. Vox-- -- Ma-- -- chi-- -- na. Oh, no, no. That would be really cool, though. I will flip a coin to Jumbo over there and tell him, listen, if things get hairy you might want to use this. Oh, God! Shit! (all laugh) As I see her do this, I am going to alter myself to have the same. I pick up the coin and hand it to Grog and say, this will make you fly. And I'll dive over the edge as well. Oh, shit. (all laugh) 16. Oh, there's something in the water, a boat. She has gills but she keeps her mouth and stuff right? I join her. Can I join her on this? Athletics? Ten. Oh! I'm alone. (all laugh) Shit. She can swim; she'll be okay. She's so strong and powerful. Oh, shit. I will-- Yes! Yes, grab my hero's hand. (all laugh) Okay. Okay. Wait, strength? I'm feeling lucky! Yeah. (all laugh) I did a lot of pushups today! Ow, ow, ow, ow. I. Was amazing. (all laugh)Â Augh! (all laugh) We'll omit that part. (all laugh) It's in my nose. There's a boat! Oh, wow, the top-down view looks so three-dimensional right now. It's really cool. 1980s graphics! (roars) We're gonna eat it. Toy boat, toy boat. SAM, TALIESIN, and Tor Books. SAM and Yeah. Yikes. Eight. Stings. Ooh. Yeah! Turn them lemons-- Noted. There's no honor in that. True, true. Oh, great. Oh, great. Yeah. Yeah. 15. Sure. Ow! Ugh. Whoa. That's sorta cocked, but that's okay, I'll take it. That's a five. Maybe I'll use Luck, and go again. Ooh, yeah. Yeah, that's ten. You should've worn boat shoes! (all laugh) Jesus. Yeah! Yeah! So, the guy right next to me is gone, right? Oh, they're gone. Okay. Okay, Can I see? No. I'm gonna climb up. Okay. No, no. It's okay. 16? So cool. So cool. Okay, I just yell back to Doty, Get rid of the grappling hooks! I don't know, I have no idea what I'm doing. And then I see that the giant thing in front of me, right? Do I see the thing? Great. I'll reach into my magic bag, and pull out a vial of acid and just throw it at the thing. What do I add? My spell attack bonus? It says-- Oh! Oh, it says-- No, it doesn't. Oh, wait, no, it says it. But it's cut off. It says, "DC one". I'm sure there's something after that, but are you talking about just to hit it? Okay, so then it's 17. Great, so that's 7d6. Okay. 26. Oh, shit! Sorry, sorry! I don't know how this stuff works! Okay. I have a bonus action. I'll use Sanctuary. On myself. Maybe they're family. Hoda, hoda, hoda, hoda. Ooh! That's sexy. Guys, we're having a water battle. Yeah. I didn't know they had gauges. Ooh. Ooh. Off the ship? Oh! No! Wow, so cool. Is that a new thing? Shank shank? Just shank shank? Okay. Can I yell out, No! New best friend! (gunshot sounds) Okay. Multiple times. Yes? This is so weird! I've read about this. Many of us will die. (all laugh) My turn? Okay. Is there water all over the deck, is it hard to move, is it okay? Okay. Yeah, those are like impervious to water. (all laugh) Yeah, I'm going to cast Haste as my action. And I get a second action, now, because I'm hasted, right? It has to be a melee attack? Can I use-- it said I could use a magic item. Or use an item, use an item. Oh, use an object, not an item. I can't use my ring or anything, right? Okay, so I'm hasted, I will use, I pick up the Ring of the Ram, and I'll ram the fish-man. Three charges, right? So I can use two? It has three charges. Well, it says I can use an action to expend one to three of its charges. Okay. I'll do all three, right? (all laugh) Ooh. 19. Oh. Natural 20. (all cheer) Okay. 35. 70. Can it be like a kid who's holding a rifle, but not up to him, so it hits him and it really throws me back a little? Five. Yes! I lost Alter Self when I hasted. You there! Hello. Aw! Guys, the conclusion of the epic series Shades of Magic, A Conjuring of Light, was just released, so go pick it up. It's put out by Tor books, a leading publisher of science fiction and fantasy for over three decades. I need a d3. Wait, two, four, six or something? Okay. 87 episodes. One kill. Yes? How many of you can fly? Amazing! Incredible! Stupendous! No, I have nothing to add, other than-- do you need my assistance in cleaning up any of these ruffians? Oh, also, one question. Did I hurt the beast? Really? I killed it! What was it? Yes! Okay! Was it bad? Pretty much! You could have flown. (muffled) Help me, I'm an orphan! Cut the red wire! While this is going on, I'm asking Captain Adella's crew for towels. Could I get a towel? Or some sort of-- I'm really wet, here. I'm just worried that this will rust if I don't get it dry soon, so if I could get some towels, or maybe someone to fan it off, that would be great. Thank you. Oh, he's dead? He's a demon. Guys, feel free to keep-- Keep tweeting those pick-up lines to @TorBooks. They like 'em. I do, anyway. Grande fantasy novel? Oh boy! Lots of whispers, guys. Hey, in the future-- Travis, what do you think about this-- don't shake your butt. That's disgusting. What if we-- here's my pitch. What if we have two tin cans and a string that just goes to Matt, and we can do like one of these things. Ah! Ah! I'm gluten-free! If I may, new companions. When my father would have-- -- sort of a cagey individual that he needed to interrogate, he had an employee named The Dog who was a large man, who would come and just squeeze them until they talked. Why don't we just do that here? It seems like it would be much quicker than talking in circles like this. Well, we have this guy, who's pretty big-- -- and I bet he could squeeze-- Well, all right. We asked for food. Aman. Percival, am I misreading the scenario here? Can I please just pour acid on him until he talks to us? It seems like he's holding back, am I misreading, here? I am following your lead. But-- Okay. All right. Sea diarrhea! May I see that? I will Identify it. Much easier this way. I think all? Scroll of Programmed Illusion. Scroll allows an arcane caster to use an action to cast the sixth-level spell Programmed Illusion. If the spell is higher-level than the caster can use, they must make a spellcasting blah-blah-blah-blah-blah. I think I am. Are you arcane? Am I the only arcane? Ooh! Should I Identify that? Can I, more than once a day? It's the Identify spell. Oh. It's a ritual, though, is that-- All right. I will ritually Identify that. What's that all about? Do we know how to activate it? Could be useful. Cloaking device? Doty. I mean, he's got a lot of stuff in there. You know. When you have two wheels and some ropes and it makes a pulley system-- All right. To see if it smells like nature. Are you my brother? Are you my brother? (all laugh) Science-bro stuff. So, using one of the opals from my Helm of whatever, Brilliance, he wanted to craft a housing for it-- Spotlight. Yeah, it lasts for an hour. Is that something we can turn off and on and it lasts for an hour, like a battery, or is it just an hour, it's off-- Okay, no problem. Can I help him? Did we get two 16s? Oh. I got a 16, but I get plus ten with my tinkerer's tools. Sure, sure. The Hallmark card way of saying fucking. I was going to say we're being social. Oh! Oh! You've got a little smudge right there. And it was the metric system! SAM and (laughs) We built our-- We were welding. Let's do it. Oh wait, we're using one? All right, sure. Why not? It's 1000 gold, but okay, sure. (all laugh) Daylight. The power of the sun. Well, wait, open it just a little bit. And then I'm gonna take my Helm of Brilliance and just put one of the diamonds up to the laser beam like light coming out so it makes like a dazzling light across the-- I don't at all. I have a lot of dictation to do. (quietly) Wow. Perception. I want to be on the flying carpet, 'cause that's amazing. Yes! Oh yeah! The robot is-- Well, he can come on the-- I have to stay behind with Doty. Is there another rowboat for us? I would like to request another rowboat for Doty. I'm missing it, hurry up! (all laugh) (laughs) We're just rowing up. What'd I miss?! Start over, start over! (pants) (laughs) (scared panting) We can reason with it. With his poop? Poops lodestones. (scared panting) No, don't kill a kraken. Hey. That is not the key at all. (incoherent background noise) Tor Books, toy boats, Tor Books. Each d20 is actually worth 22 up there. (all laugh) Yeah.
