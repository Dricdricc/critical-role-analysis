You're a pal and you pay for our show. And 000224.616 --> 000232.889 if I nuked my laptop, viruses fill the whole thing up with porn. I would see you and you'd send my 000232.889 --> 000240.476 hard drive back to me and the card attached would say, "Thank you being our Yev." 000244.192 --> 000249.885 SamIsOurHero. 000345.309 --> 000349.903 Yes and we have other people to thank for putting this whole thing together.

You might also hear some light backing vocals from a young Sam Riegel and a young 001027.111 --> 001034.991 Travis Willingham buried deep in there and we should also give a shout out to Jason Charles 001034.991 --> 001041.135 Miller who co-wrote the song and also did a lot of the instrumentation and made it really cool and 001041.135 --> 001048.434 rock and roll and stuff. You'll see-- you won't see. You'll hear, there's a little violin part by 001048.434 --> 001052.689 Colm McGuinness who's a friend of the show. He recorded a violin part. 001052.689 --> 001053.976 Yeah. My brother-in-law Peter Habib of Mr. Fantastic did the final mix for the song. It was 001100.931 --> 001106.579 really fun to do and now it's out there and you guys saw it and we hope you like it. 001106.579 --> 001113.442 Oh, and also I think the song-- Do we announce about the song? 001117.724 --> 001119.185 The song will be on iTunes and stuff soon?
