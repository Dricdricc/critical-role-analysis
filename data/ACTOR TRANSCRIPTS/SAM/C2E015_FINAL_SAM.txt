The Legendary Bundle includes all the digital materials available at D&D Beyond, so check it out now and as part of what they announced last week, D&D Beyond is contributing $100 to 826LA for every natural one we roll and to honor that-- I've written a folk song. I don't play. I need participation for this one, guys. When I call for it, you have to say the number one. This is all in honor of us rolling ones, right? (singing) ♪ We're-- ♪ la la, hmm! (laughing) ♪ We're rolling ones, rolling them every night. We're rolling ones, ♪ rolling them every fight. How many times has Ashley been back? ♪ ♪ How many times has Caleb had a bath? ♪ ♪ How many testicles does Sam have? ♪ ♪ How many chords are there in this song? ♪ Two. ♪ What's the past tense of win? ♪ ♪ What's Obi Kenobi's middle name? ♪ ♪ What's a synonym for pasty and pale? ♪ Thank you, Liam. ♪ What will the Washington football team do when they face the Cowboys? ♪ ♪ Ones, rolling them every night. ♪ That's it. (cheering and laughing) The full portrait? Not the pixelated one? But these criminals promised us! Do we remember which boat we were on? That's okay! We can just do it now while people are watching you. Great! Done. Yeah! Jesus, Laura. Prepare? Oh. Me? I forgot. Did you give me holy oil? I have it, apparently. Well, what am I supposed to do with it? Should I dip my bolts into it? Okay. Which scene? Where are we going? I know something about sailing! The right one is the bow and the left one is the stern. Well, we're in the lead boat and Yasha's paddling, so Yasha, it's up to you! Good oar work! How long are the oars? Thanks. No! What?! I'm not going to get in the water, don't worry! Yeah, I've been practicing one technique! It's called wearing this ring of water walking! (laughter) Tried and true! Oh, that's a good idea! Can I ghost ride the whip? Oh! I'm going to gingerly-- Just ghost ride. Barefoot it onto the water and see what happens. Ooh, not good, but it's dexterity, so six? This is fun! Hand me a rope, I'll water ski! All right, I'll try to pull myself back up? Jesus, that's an intense water ski. Ah! What happened? What's going on? Of course that hits. Yes. We're already in it? We just started! Wait, we're rolling ones! That's $100! (cheering) Two. No. Jesus. Wow. That's it? We suck. Ten. Whoa. What? You guys are all single digits? Oh boy! You do. You really do. That's it. That's all the numbers in German. Not again! Do I take any of that? Oh! Can I try to get out of the grapple? Is that a thing that I can do? All right. I will push with all my little might against the creepy-- Ooh! Just a strength check? 18! (yell) That's my action. I can't see it. Okay, I'll spend the rest of my turn trying to figure out if that was caused by just touching the water. Because I'm not sure what happened. Sure. I used my action to-- We'll remember where they are. It's fine, just leave them. Oh boy. (gunshot) Welcome back, Laura. I'm dead. Those are just rocks. It's fine. It's rocks. No! Does not. Yay. I will, seeing the one on Caleb, spin around and fire my hand crossbow at that one. Disadvantage. It was going to be good, ten. Then I'll turn again and shoot with my bonus action at the one that I'm engaged with. MATT All righty. So 20 to hit. I will still say Get off of my boat. I cause two points of damage. Oh wait, no! Six points of damage. But he is not engaged, is he? Why do I get disadvantage? Yeah, but I ignore all disadvantage with my Crossbow Expert feat. Yeah. Well, next time. That's going to be a lot of damage. Wait, I don't even remember what I rolled. All right. That's a lot. It's 20 points of damage. It's okay, I don't need it. Good gravy. You're going to action row? Oar Master. Smash into their boat? Can we see anything? We might be okay. Action row! We'll never know what they were, what they could have done! That's true. Maybe they had information for us. Crazy roll there, Travis. He says to stop! Action brakes! Are there sides of the river? We should go investigate. I'm going to take my old little dry flowers and just stick them in his gross, ichor-y hair. Like coming from another room? This all checks out. We are in the right place. Oh. Gross. Just gross. You're super gross. Offensive! We're going down? Do you need me to check for traps? I'll take a big swig of shitty alcohol. (deep voice) I always take up the rears. Check for traps! Is that cocked? As hell? There is, but now it just moved. Well, that's a natural 20. (laughter) It's 15 feet long? Yeah? Because this is where we are. This is the shaft in front of me, and then there's another? A longer shaft? So we can go down that shaft if we wanted to? Okay, these are the balls. I have no idea of the layout of this room. I was just going for a gag. There are no traps here. Should we continue on straight ahead? Or Schmidt. Me and Frumpkin? Am I protecting-- Okay. All right. I'm ten feet behind the cat. That hits. Ah! Fuck! (laughter) Let me check. I'll see if there's any other triggers for this trap. 22. I'm going to go forward a bit, onto the next pressure plate. Does not hit. Oh god. There's many of them. Oh god, there's lots of traps! I'm dying out here! (laughter) Boy, oh boy, rogues suck. How much further until the end of this hall? They reset, though, right? I don't know! I'm on this one, and I'm going to listen to see if this one's resetting also. Okay, I'll see if there's a way to disarm it, or plug the hole, or something. 18. I do have ball bearings. Hold on, I have so many things. Oh god. I don't want to get rid of that, that's cute. A vase! Ah, shit. I take my brass doorknob and shove it in there. I am going to take the doorknob back. Shit. It shoots out anyway? Great. I don't know! I check for more traps. Two for investigation. I don't know how to be a rogue! I rolled a seven. That was not a two, it was a seven. Great. We're all clear! I hope so. I'm running. I am so sorry. I did not handle that very well. I was told to check for traps and I missed many of them and I will strive to do better in the future and I'm sorry and this one, this one's on me. I'm sorry. It is! All these traps are different. I wish they would just stick with the rope across the hallway trap. Yeah. That's the one I know. It's a tried and true classic. How wide is the whole chamber again? Yeah, there's a little dot next to it. What are they? They're all over the ceiling? Those are on the ceiling? Let me just check for traps. I'm going to walk around the immediate area checking for traps. 22. No traps? Ten minutes? Does it look like it goes inside? I'll go gingerly touch the base and see if it moves a little bit. How do we turn a ceiling? The top of what? She's good at finding holes. This wide. Wait, Jester draws great. Jester can draw. This is my chance for redemption. Let me break the traps first. Can I have a handful of ball bearings? Thank you. I'll start working on it. I'm going to disarm trap three. 19, plus stuff. Okay, I'm going to go to trap one. Ooh, not as good. Six plus six, right? 12? Oh boy. Oh, yeah, that hits. (heavy breathing) While it's reloading, I'm going to jam some ball bearings in with my other hand and try to break it. Nine. Yes. What else I got? Misses. (frustrated growl) I'm going to try one more time. Natural 20! (cheering) (relieved panting) All clear! It's fine, it's nothing. It's fine, it's just a little blood. (pained groaning) No, that's the bolt. Hey! It's too soon! Wait, so who's going up? But who's going to be downstairs to--? I'm going to pop a healing potion. I mean, I don't want to impose, but I'm bleeding profusely. It helps. Yes. I'm going to scoot around the side and see if I can peek into those holes. Those reliefs in the walls. Alcoves. 16. I will inform the others. Maybe. I'm going to get my crossbow ready to fire. Why would they put trash urns in these weird-- Am I ready to fire? Okay. I'm going to shoot a crossbow bolt at that fire. Natural 20. Okay. Is this sneak attack or no? I don't even know what this creature is. I deal 16 points of damage. I don't know. Wow. Okay. That's 28 points of damage. All the dice are doubled? Good god. (shouting) No time to thank me. (shouting) No! No time! It's my own urn. 22. Is that true? Oh god, that is awful. Sure! I will shoot towards (cocking sound). Is the one near Molly engaged with Molly? Okay. I will shoot at the one next to Molly. Not good, 12. (cocking sound) Fire again, bonus action! Not much better. 15. Twice. No, I'm engaged, right? I'm going to say, (shouting) Help me! I'm going to die, I'm going to die! What are you throwing? Wastehunter! Wow! Oh, I feel so safe. Come on, Yasha! Hurt them with your strength! Just pull out another d6. Taliesin hates pot! Oh! Why don't we do that with all of them? Yeah! Whoa, so cool! That was amazing! I'm desperately injured. No. Again, I don't want to impose. If you're offering, I'll take it, but I am definitely bleeding from my eyes. Aw. I feel guilty for having needs! Oh wait, I could've just-- we could have rested and I could've used hit dice. Oh, shit! As he falls, I throw a piece of feather and I cast Feather Fall on him. 60 feet. A rope? I appreciate it. I sewed my thumb back on. We've also discovered that Ashley has more dice than Laura, apparently. What is this? What is this gigantic box of dice? Yeah, but she doesn't use those. These are all active for tonight! This is terrible. I thought we were supposed to turn the ceiling from up here, no? No, we should use the stairs. I don't know. It seems like they know, they decided without us. So smart. That's dead things, good things, and in-between things? I did that. Why don't we try a person to use the rod first before we start wasting spells? You're weak, shouldn't we use a strong person? Yasha, you're strong. Why don't you go try and twist the thing? What is it? Evocation? Wait, if we had picked a different magic would a different monster-- Everything's a dick joke with you, Laura. Seven. It can be restrained, that thing? You're going to sit on the floor? Oh no. Because it's her strength? You did great! Way to go, Yasha! Yasha! Yes, I feel so conflicted trying to hurt a cube. But I will. I will bash that cube until it explodes all over the place. Wait. I rolled a natural 20 to attack with my hand crossbow. With sneak attack? And it's crit so double? 24, plus-- 28. Oh, and I'll use Fury of the Small to make it 30! Fury of the Small. Let me look. Yes. Oh, shit! Class features. I'm looking. I don't know. I'll look it up later! For which archetype? Spellcasting, Mage Hand? Oh shit, I should've used Mage Hand before! I don't know what I should be doing! Okay. Then I will move around that way, yes, as far as possible. And I'll shoot again. Why not? With advantage still? 18 plus a lot. Seven more points of damage. Can I say that it looks like that artisanal ice that you get at really classy bars, and now I'm really thirsty for like a scotch. It's like Bigby's Paw? That's all the points! Jester, like all beautiful women, succumbed to the cube. Yasha's a healer, right? You'll be fine! First roll to hit. At the same time? I don't know. You taught me magic. What are mine? What are my spells? Here, I'll show you on D&D Beyond. Most of mine are illusion and something else. Okay, I can do evocation! No. But I can do climb! Or we do it to the rod. In the hole. I can do Shocking Grasp as a evocation spell. Can't we cast it on the staff? No. You keep it. I'll do it. Wait, no. We have to do it instantaneously. Yeah, what's the problem with that? At the count of zwei. Shocking Grasp. (gibberish) We have to be in the room! Why don't we cast it on the rod? So creepy. What? Parts of the symbols are glowing more. I know those! I know an enchantment spell and an illusion spell. Why don't you do trans? I'll do enchant. Oh, you can? I'm so glad you taught me magic, Caleb. I don't know how it works, and I'm not paying any attention. I'm very drunk. One, two three, right there! That's where we need to spin it over there! Oh! Right there! See? That symbol matches with this one. I figured this out, guys! (laughter) So what do you have? I have illusion and transmutation. I'm illusion. What about you Fjord? Don't you have some spells on you? Why aren't you helping out? Where are we casting it upon? All right. I go over next to the illusion one. I'm taking a bit of fleece and doing some hand symbols and casting Silent Image. All right, I'll look for traps. I know it's my job. 13. All clear. I take another swig from my flask. Pretty drunk. It's been a long night. By the way, Yasha, can I say, you weren't even with us yesterday, and now you're down here doing this! Is this crazy? What were you doing yesterday? But did you know that you'd be down here with us tonight? How did you know that? How and when will I die? But you know! I have a healing potion. No, you're the worst with money. Kill it! Break it! Make what? What the fuck are you talking about? (laughter) Sounds good, Fjord. Do you need my help? A light stone? You want me to check it? I go up and check. I got a-- oh wait, disadvantage, I'm drunk. That's a 19. Liam just got an erection. Proficiencies. No, it's not there. Come on, D&D Beyond! I hope that doesn't get rid of all your other spells. Siff Duthar! He'll tell me! Oh boy. This seems like beyond our level stuff. Just say that all again one more time, Matt. That is hard core. Wait, what?! I'm so confused! He's going to talk to us. May I ask What were we sent here to get again? Just research? Archer season seven?
