In honor of Marvel Puzzle Quest sponsoring this episode, we actually had Grog write the advertising copy. It starts like this. I am Grog. I smash things and people. Sometimes, I use a hammer, much like another big man named Thor! Thor is not a goliath, but he is strong, almost as strong as Grog. I like Thor because his name is easy to say. Thor is on a quest to a place called Marvel Puzzle. This Marvel Puzzle Quest must be magic, because it happens only on telly-phones and inty-nets. You have to press buttons to rage. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard! Inspired by Thor's rock, he calls it Ragnarock, the Sakaar Arena event is going on, where you team up with Thor in 20-person lightning rounds for prizes. Grog would not have to team up with anyone to win in any arena, because Grog is already the champion named Philip. You can load-down this Marvel Puzzle Quest for free! That means no gold, Vax-- Vex. Fuck! You can download it at the Apple Store. I like apples! Google Play. I like to play! Or the Amazon app store. I like amazons. Or Steam! I don't like steam. It is angry water and it makes my face hurt. Also, ale. The end. Pike wrote it down. My voice acting is good. That would be amazing. Wearing all the shirts. Did we ever have socks? We have socks. I don't own the socks! We're all bears? And we can ask each other, too! I'm going to read that letter that I wrote to Pike! All kinds of shit. Everyone, do your Laura Bailey impression! She plays the car that's on fire. Shit, I never did mine. You're turning into Grog right now? Yeah, yes, they just whipped up a fresh batch of tzatziki sauce to go with it. I mean, should I go wake up the others? Grog, I'm already tiny. Even tinier? It sounds great. I mean, this is so unlike you. The eyes are haunting. That's amazing! Wait, did you draw Grog? I guess you're not playing with us? How does this work? Keep the wine coming! I should warn you, I'm a power gamer. Yeah, you know, I get really into it. I'll make a toast. I'll make a toast, yeah. (clears throat) Right then! My character has a different accent than Scanlan does. Well, I know, but I want to get into it, right? Right then, we did a really good job in the fight today! So I think that we should all propose a toast to the one that fell. Keyleth. I'm sorry she'll never be joining us again. To Keyleth. What does that mean? What's a dexterity check? How do you know what to add? Grog, Grog! I'm going to try to turn invisible, if that's all right. Can I just do that? I normally just do that. All right, I'm going to go invisible and I'm going to try to swipe the spear before she gets to it. Okay. Seven, plus-- ten. So, it's ten. This many. Oh shite, I dropped the spear! He's so good at this, though! I feel like we should keep supporting this! He's never been good at anything intellectual and now this is it! So maybe we should support him and go with it. Sorry? Really quickly into my earring, I say She's got a baby with her! I don't know, just thought you might like to know. You don't do that. That you became part druid? Just "yes, and," Vax. Yes, and. Good voice, Grog! He does not understand this game. If we're going to be here for a while, Grog, can I have some of my invisible servants come in and lightly play a light accompaniment music? Play some strings or flutes? Oh there it is, it's nice. I actually can't. I will know. She'll be able to read it on my face. She can see all of my lies. Oh, if it's make-believe, then, here you go! Here are your meats for you, right there! Ask him his name. Because I want to hear what Grog comes up with! It's not run out, he said he has more downstairs, or there's some outside in the back. Vax, he's presenting us with a choice. We, as a group, must make this choice together. I volunteer to go to the sty. Vax has no idea. You've really caught onto this game quickly. Do we hear it upstairs? That's right, we have to. He'll know if we don't get him some, so let's go sneaky back there to make sure there's no monsters hiding. Sure! We tell our Bunion Master that we're going out there to sneak around and then he'll make it happen for us. To pick it up? Sure I could, but shouldn't we try to lift it first? Sure, right, this is all make-'em-up. It doesn't matter, right? I'm picking up a pig? And we're trying to move a pig? That's what I thought. Yeah! I'd like to cast Bigby's Hand and lift the cask. All right. Come with me, O hand that holds the cask of our dreams. I got points! Wait, I got 300 points. I'm winning! What does that stand for, Grog? Yes, I float it back in and I present it in front of the barkeep and say, Bob! Your cask awaits. This would be a good opportunity for you all to get some XP. I call it Bigby's Hand! Oh. I call it Bigby's Hand because a man named Bigby invented it. I don't know anything about this Bigby. I learned it from another bard a long time ago. It was a he. He was actually a stand-up comedian. That was his thing. Yeah. Oh no. Did we just drink poison? Wait, that's it? But we were just having fun! He really paints a vivid picture. You have that special sense! Try to sense if there's any flagons around? 18, Grog! I did already. Oh, we got something! Something's happening! Marvel Puzzle Quest. It's a fantastic game. It looks like two boobs. Come on, even in this imaginary game, we're invincible heroes of justice. Let's just go look! A tip. Well, let's go explore. I'm going to walk around the room. I'm going to walk up the shaft. Maybe you left, me right? I'll be to the right of the shaft. He's pants left. You don't want to go too fast down the shaft. No, no, he's all the way on the left wall. Just going to really just snug the edges of the shaft. Yes. We do move forward. I did not say that. (screaming) My cheek, it burns, it burns! We don't know if it's poisoned yet. I assume not. I assume I'm okay. I pull down my pants. I'll be the judge of that. There's lots of holes with darts in them, what, what? (laughter) Do you need any kind of subscription to watch it, or can you-- Yeah, there's traps. There's lots of traps down the shaft. That is a permanent marker. Is that yours? 17. It's a ghost of some sort, holding a shovel. You bought that ghost with a shovel already? Why is he holding a shovel? 14. Shall I tell the unseen servants to change the music? Play something more rousing, please. Thank you. I'm not in character now. I'm just Scanlan. Don't worry, Vex, it's not Real-Trinket, it's Imagination-Trinket. Real-Trinket is still alive. Yes, musicians, calm down. I'll show you how it's done. Scanlan, in real life, is not a very strong person, but I'm playing my character as very strong, so Scanlan runs in and pushes hard on the wall. Ooh. 16. I need some help over here! A lit cabin? TRAVIS, LIAM, and I think it's investigation. I will stick with her. So I can protect her. That's only when I in-character talk to someone else. Did you buy a dog? Some sort of demon dog. Doesn't she have to step back to shoot an arrow? Well, ask the Bunion Master. Thank you, Grog. Thank you. Yeah, we all were Vax. Sorry, we didn't want to tell you but we were all there, that's why we know how to play the game so well. It's such a good game that we all wanted to play and share it with you. But we also knew that we would probably win because you don't know how to play. Oh sorry, change the music again please. No, that's just the shape of the cavern. Yeah. The spear that you picked up at the tavern? 18. I'm going to step forward and call to the beast. "Beast, look in my eyes and follow my "commands!" And I will cast Dominate Monster on the beast. He has to roll a wisdom save. Against 22. I command you, beast, to attack this bear. Relentless attack! I don't get to do this in real life, so I thought I'd experiment with different things in fantasy land. Wait, 19 is half of what? Of 29? That tracks for Grog, sure. The BM is always right. Grog, this noob is bringing the whole table down. Hits Trinket! I've seen you burn grits. That's true. It's true, all my furniture is bearskin furniture. I don't even clean it, it's just bloody bear skin. Any points? Boints. Xylophone bears. I'd like to go to the other fountain and do the same. 11. Do the fountains get any harder? In this or in the game? In the mansion. Sure, yes. We have some desserts. Trying to think of vegan desserts. Not flan. Sorbet is right. It's just fruit and sugar, right? All right. Five...six? Five. We're five. Five pomegranate sorbets please. Seeds in. Wow! Let's go investigate that door over there. I'll go over there. Yeah. That hits. Sure. (groans) Ow! Ouch! Why would you do that, Trinket? I feel like I should retaliate. But that might piss off Vex. I will inspect the door. Five. I open it. Is there a handle? I'll open the latch. I'm going through the doorway first with Trinket. I will go first. I rolled a one. Are we able to see inside, like we are right now, Grog? So we don't know that there's carpets in the individual rooms in there? I'm just gonna walk around the five-sided circle and just make sure there's doors on each of its five sides. Which one is open? The one with the star on it. I'd like to go investigate that door. I would like to investigate. 24. No traps that I saw? All right, I'll step into the room. While no one is looking at me, I will take out a bit of meat and the poison I've never used in the game, it's called Death Blade Poison. I've had it since we ran Pathfinder. I'm gonna just tuck it into the meat. Just keep it with me. Meka-gaming. All right, I'm looking about the room for anything interesting. All right. I will look under the rug. Just a little bit, yeah. All right. What's that thing at the far side of it? Is that a chest? That's an open chest, isn't it? I go look in the open chest. Nothing's here, someone's been through here already. There's nothing in this one, guys. Maybe the symbols correspond to us. The star being me, because I'm the star. Money for you, because you're greedy. The square for Vax, because he's a square. Are there any gems on my door, or are they all gold? Almost like a grunt. Was Grog always a doppelgänger? I'm looking at a ficus in my room. Seems nice. Insult his honor? This is his electric glove. Scanlan falls to his knees, feeling a great pain in his soul. A hollowness that wasn't there before. I can't believe I lost me mate. What what? Do I get any XP for that? Wait, it's still glowing now, right? The same two jewels are lit up on mine. Is that true? Oi. Right. Servants. Continue the creepy music and bring us more wine, please. Are you sure we shouldn't go wake up the others upstairs? I guess it's not the others. It's just Pike, because Keyleth is dead. No, she's really dead. What is that stupid voice you're using? No, my character in the game talks like this. Yeah. All right, on the count of three. I'm representing my character! On three! On three! Free. We've got the wrong doors. We got the wrong doors! Yours is correct, Vex, because you are greedy. I'm a cube. I'm a cube. Switch with me, Percy! Oh, the de Rolo! What are you drinking, piss? What is that? Oh. That's a lot of apple juice. I don't think I've drank that much apple juice since I was eight. Grog, what is with your voice? What are you talking about?! "My room." I'm going in to investigate my room. One. I'll open the trunk. (yelling) A pseudopod attacks me? 16 points of damage. Nor cast a spell. Unless I have a spell that does not need a vocal thing. Let me just check. Let's see here. Sure. Carry on-- Yes! I'm trying to figure out, did Travis find these things and put them in the room or did he think, what can I put in a room? I'll go through the Monster Manual and be like, ooh, a rug! And put that in there. What else can I put in a room... ooh! A plant! But I can't talk. We're not going to mega-game. Sure. Servants, come on, now! 13. Should I escape, or should I kill it? I don't know. I will step back, and I will Lightning Bolt it at level five! I will Lightning Bolt it at level five! He has to make a dex save. I think it's a dex save. Oh boy. It's probably either 15, or it's my spell DC. If it's my spell DC, I wouldn't have the cone up, so it would be 20. Well, either way, he fails, so he gets 10d6 of damage. How many is that? That's nine. 39. Oh! And one more. 43. I inspect the vial. I chug it. What is that, four something? Everyone, all the rooms have horrible creatures in them! Be careful! How many do you have? That is good to know, actually. Seems like mine's open, too. I'm going to turn into a dung beetle and fly straight up. It's solid?! I thought it had bars. I thought it had bars! Then I'm back out as a gnome, and I guess I'm falling. More damage? All right. Shit. All right. Now I will turn into a monkey. A gibbon. Big enough that it has muscles. I crawl up to the top and try to push open the latch. Natural 20. SAM and I shit on the latch and keep going. That's a circle, just like the last one. Except for one. Who would have been the star? Wait, are there walls separating us? Did he ruin your designer pepper mill? You looked these up last night, you had to look these up. I rolled one. 20, 20, one, my last three rolls. I did 4d4 plus four, is that right for a greater healing potion? Go home, unicorn. You already cast Speak With Animals today. Bring it. That hits. Oh yeah, I'm no longer a monkey. Yeah, that hits. Scanlan has an AC of 14. Great. I'm still double digits. (muttering) Challenge rating. Am I in its-- All right, I'm contractually required to turn into a triceratops. Yeah. This unicorn. Oh, before I did that, I Healing Worded myself for like ten points of health there, as a bonus. And now I am a triceratops and I will use the rest of my turn to back into the corner. Yeah, that's it. Thank you. I'm looking up all my stats. I haven't been a triceratops in over a year. One more time, just not trying to kill you. You got it wrong. We are missing a piece. That hits. Hits. Whoa! Great. A little bit. Without leaving his attack range, and thus not provoking an attack of opportunity I hope, I'm going to charge for his leg and hit it with a gore attack. So I'm going to move down the line and attack his leg. Rolling a two. Plus nine. End of turn. Wait, five feet Teleport? What spell is that?! Why aren't you killing the unicorn? Please tell me she falls on the horn. Like Free Willy! (screech) Wait, you have to roll to hit. Hits. Okay, back to Scanlan. Meanwhile, me and Laura still haven't dealt any damage to ours at all. Put Scanlan back on there. As a bonus action, I will 2nd-level Healing Word myself. Need to do that. That's seven plus six. Oh, that's 13 points, that helped. And I will just step back a little, not a lot. Then I will cast Reverse Gravity and send him skyward. (laughter) Does it hurt him to hit the top? He would actually technically not fall. He just stays there. He stays there for a minute. So that's ten rounds of damage. What do they look like? Any clothing that we recognize? I'll come look. Seven perception. I'm going to inspire the bear. I'm going to inspire the bear. By feeding it meat. Go on, Trinket. Smell real well tonight, Trinket! And I will actually inspire the bear. Oh no, does anyone know CP-bear? I don't what's happened to your bear! Something's wrong with him! I think you've done that already today. I-- (laughs) (wheezing) I don't know! I mean, maybe it was something else? Maybe it was the unicorn? It was the unicorn's powerful magic. Deception check? 33. You can beat my deception. You can roll against it, right? What's the DC? I rolled a 15. But it's minus two! But it's still 13. I don't know what happened with your bear. You know, I found that meat back there. Maybe it was poison or something, but I wouldn't know from poison, I'm a simple pauper. Seemed hungry! Climb. First, I'm going to bonus Healing Word myself again. Is this an acrobatics check? Athletics check. I will inspire myself. Ooh, that's four plus three plus four. I've essentially undone my heal. Insight check. Nine. Four, six, nine, and--? We did the same thing what you did. Why? Are we fighting each other or are we just fighting you? Ten. Scanlan? What do I do? I will bonus action heal myself again. Consistently healing myself. Good. Yeah, sure. All right, that's something. Are we trying to kill Grog? All right. I will cast Bigby's Hand at 6th-level, and I will punch Grog. It's 10d6, and it just hits because you're restrained, I think. It's d6s, right? It's either 6d8 or 10d6. Let me look it up real fast. Bigby's Hand. (muttering) Clenched fist. It's 6d8. I need d8. All right. That's it. 6d8. That's what I did. 24. Yes. It doesn't automatically crit or anything, right? And then I will back away, slowly. Maybe speak to him in unicorn language. He dies, too? Is Grog dead? What has the story taught us? No, it actually taught us that in the end, we have to kill Grog. Before the sun rises, I cast Wish that Trish has persistent gonorrhea forever. I think I do have to roll something. 17. (laughter) Wow. Wait, because that was the end of Bunions and Flagons. We're still in character. Cathew Verser? All right, we'll look out for him. I think bard gnomes are not that good. I think next time I'm going to be a ranger. I have 300 XP. Ale. I call a servant over, and I say Bring him some chicken. You had the perfect amount! Go to bit.ly/marvelcrit, and make sure that they know that you came from Critical Role. They're not those one-sided scarves. That was the worst delivery of that line.
