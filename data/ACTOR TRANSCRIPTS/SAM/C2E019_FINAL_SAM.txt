Yes, our second sponsor for the evening is Backblaze! (cheering) Flits around a lot. He's just settling down in here. It's okay! Oh look! Magic is real! I have it right here in the bag! Yev, how does Backblaze work? TOY IN Oh! He says you can restore files anywhere via direct download. Shh. I've got a backup if it doesn't work. He says you can restore files anywhere via direct download, or restore by mail and receive a hard drive with your files. Yes, Yev, but how does Backblaze keeps all those backups for such a low price? TOY IN Wait! Yev says that they harness the power of love to store data and that love also sustains your life? Wait a second, without your love, you'll die?! Oh my god! TOY IN Oh god, everyone! Yev is sick! Maybe the power of our applause will cure him. Everyone clap. Oh my god no, it's made it worse! His lung has collapsed. He's bleeding internally. Oh my god, what can we do?! He says that not enough people have visited backblaze.com/criticalrole. That's him shaking, it's not me. My puppetry work is amazing. TOY IN Not enough people have visited backblaze.com/criticalrole to sign up to get a 15-day free trial. Critters! If you want Yev to live, you need to click on the site right now! Oh god! Oh god, he's flatlining. He's dead. Yev is dead! The Backblaze faery is dead. TOY IN Oh! What?! It's a miracle! Enough critters visited backblaze.com/criticalrole and signed up. You saved his life! We can continue the show. LAURA and Puppetry. That was a real faery, guys. A child's lightsaber toy thing. I know, it's too quiet. It's a dragon. Oh no, it ran out of batteries! Everyone clap! Yeah, it's alive! Is that true? The inside story. What time of day is it right now? That is my voice. I'm dialing it in still. (vocalizes trying to find Nott's voice) What time is it? Let's do it. Research facility? Oh! Got it. I turn to Mollymauk and say I got three gold on Thed. Just you and me. That was amazing. Thank you! That's the fury of the small. Oh Jesus! Oh god! And I'll take five. Five gold, I've got Jester. Guys, she's our healer. Can someone-- she's dying right now. Is she okay? That's an hour. What does that mean? He means Louis. Question. Will she come willingly? Oh. What work is that? One more thing though, our other offer was for 10,000 gold. Seems like maybe you could match that just to make it a little bit more equal? Or like a bumper pool table that we can all-- Well, Molly, you've been talking about getting out of town. It gets us out of town. The shitty swamp? Also, this way gets us to go straight through Hupperdook. I'm just saying. It's like a cool name for a town. Hupperdook! They've got a soft serve place there. It'll be great. We know those monsters, though. I took care of all those traps. Could someone remind me, because when The Gentleman looks at me I get a little bit-- yeah, you know, flippity-flee? No, the sweat thing bothers me. I think it's sweat. To hide all the sweat stains on his undershirt? I don't know! It's just weird, right? Like he's always sweating? That's true. Yes. Anyway, I missed the whole part about the swamp. What's that mission again? What do we have to do? But wait-- find the safehouse and do what to it? Secure it? Straight shot. Yeah, I'm special. Nott has a dot matrix printer. Oh, yes it is. Jester, do you think people who live in Hupperdook are called Dookies? Or Huppers? We should call them Dookies, for sure. If I may, Yasha? We're going to be really close to your old, you know, place where you lived? Yes. Xhorhas isn't just here. Xhorhas goes all the way up here. Oh, it's the Greying Wildlands. Oh. Yes, of course. I'll come with you, Fjord. Well, will you be reassigning it very quickly if we don't take it? That's the Lebenda one? It sounds like it's going to be no sweat. We'll stay high and dry. Crapper, Shitter, W.C., Toilet, John. One of each. No. This has really whet our appetite. I just can't stop staring at his face, it's soaking wet! Sorry. Don't sweat the small stuff. Just going to leave a handkerchief. Just in case. There's nothing at Pumat's anymore. Here it is. (laughter and pained yelling) Are you just going to walk? Do four horses pulling the cart and two solo? Six. We have six horses. We have six horses. Yes. Only five of them have names. We never came up with a name for the sixth horse. Loaf is a good name. We have WC, Lou, John, Crapper, Toilet, and Loaf. I want it as well. That's the name of the horse. Oh no! Did you not have cat where you grew up? Did they have dogs? It's nighttime now? We should not let them do that. Why would you tell me that? Now I'm very scared! Did we bring any warm clothes? We're the worst. (whispered) Romantically. (whispered) Eight months ago. Great first date. Me and Caleb. Me and Molly, I guess. I'm on third watch. You don't know! Oh, ten. Why is it disadvantage? If it makes you feel any better, I lost money on Jester on the next one. Probably! Unless he mops himself down at night. Wait, think about his sheets! What a disaster his sheets must be! No, my hometown is further to the south, it's the opposite direction. Yes. But there is no hometown. We travel around a lot, we have an area of operation, but never really called one place home. Yeah, there's tents, and some people sleep in bags or huddle together. Whatever we can find, really, leaves. No, it's terrible. Would you like that? No, it's not fun at all. You find whatever piece of cloth you can and wrap yourself in it and some mud and that's your bed. It's terrible. That and many other things, yes. Have you ever seen a goblin before? Yes. Well, have you seen any others? Have you heard stories of them? I mean, you can tell me. There's no love there. Everything you've heard about goblins is true. They're awful in every way. All right, so that's true. But it doesn't really matter if you're good or bad; we will come and steal you if you are a child, anyway. Take it easy. We would share with the rest of the clan. But of course we would eat children. I'm really not. Goblins are terrible, terrible creatures. With great honesty I can tell you that I've never eaten a child. Kind of hard to read. Listen. My clan, I can't speak for other clans, but the goblins that I was with for quite some time, we stole from people. We stole food, we stole money when we could, we stole clothing and provisions, but when times were tough, we would steal the people, too. Well, goblins don't really-- I'm sure I have parents. Yeah. Once a child is born and nursed for a bit and then it's communal property. As soon as you can work, they give you a job and you do the job. Everyone in the clan, I assume, is related somehow, but-- Yeah. There was no real family ties. Caleb, as always, is right. I do not have an urge to kill and eat children. I do have cravings for things I assume you, other species, do not. Rats. Cats sometimes. Bacon. I really like bacon. Just in general, meat is pretty good, but no. A human child is a wonderful thing. Why would I want to kill or hurt a human child? No. I'm not bloodthirsty. I just get hungry for food sometimes. Not for flesh. I just like meat. I would love some. (eating noises) No. I like children a great deal. No! Not in my belly! You're borderline offensive! Listen everyone, this is what happened to me. Here is my definite backstory. --one day-- All right, what is it? Does it look like good smoke or bad smoke? When you say it, it has such a different color to it. They're burning people? We call that a barbecue. (laughter) We could just walk over there. It's a hassle to turn him into a bird. Yasha's leading the way? The cat! Yeah, do it. Nothing? Great! Can we stay the night there? For all of us or just you? I would like that. LAURA Okay. We will. But you can't see in the dark. Oh yeah. I will aid. Hmm, what? What is it? Which direction? Point to it. Oh, shit. Are they all on one? Do I see anything? Or a health cure arrow. Never going to happen. Anyway Caleb, this is what happened to me as-- Oh no! You said goblin-like creatures. Nice improv! You're asleep, though. Oh wait, I never said mine. 15. Sorry. Wait, what'd you have Molly? Okay. Miss. Oh that's right, from the first shot. Take it! Car face! I yell to Caleb Modern Literature! Then I run towards these two goblins over here. Yep. I take out my hand crossbow and I point it from the goblins to Caleb, and I fire. I'm aiming for the book strapped under his armpit that only I know is under his clothes, and I rolled a natural 20. TRAVIS and He's going to play dead. Modern Literature. That was my bonus action. For my action, I will tell the two goblins-- Now I have a bonus action? Can I use it to talk? Okay, so in Goblin, I'm going to say to them I'll hold them off! You get the loot with the horses! It's in Goblin. 13? Wait, this is persuasion or deception? 13. No! Don't save him! You're blowing it! I should have told everyone the names of all the set plays! (pigeon cooing) Like real, or like see-through? Are they real, or are they see-through? Wolves? Where are the wolves? You're strong. You got to close out of that to see the-- (Texas drawl) Booming Blade. Yeah, Mollymauk! What did you attack? Full amplify. Okay. I'll hold up the hand crossbow, point it in Yasha's general vicinity, and say I'll finish the job, sister! I will fire at the ogre. Oh no! Only a 13-- oh wait, no, it went up. 14. Yeah. I think I get all the sneak attack? Ugh. 15 plus Fury of the Small. 19. All right. Yes, I'll say Shit, I missed! Let me try again! I'll reload and I'll go pop and shoot the goblin right next to me. Oh no, I missed! I have movement, but if I move away-- no, I'll just stick. Spiritual Weap! But she's raging. By the way, Matt, last round I should have done 20 points of damage, not 19 because I'm level five now. Matt's falling apart. How will the writers communicate with him? Without those, we'll see his feminine wrists. (laughter) Jesus. 21 points against who? MARISHA and Oh, shit! Do I get a--? Oh. Sure. I mean, I can't use my crossbow as a melee-- no. Can I do a hand punch? 20. 20. Strength bonus. Oh, 17. My unarmed strike says plus three to hit for some reason. I have no idea why. Zero. He's going down. Take it as a pet! Oh. I'm going to turn and chase the goblin that ran away from me. Mm-hmm. How far away is he? Okay. Well, with 30 feet, I will take a shot. Okay. Okay. Just one, right? Seven points of damage. He had seven from the magic missile. Plus a one point punch. Cool. I can't see the other one that went towards the horses, right? All right, I'm going to use my bonus action to dash closer to the body to see if I can recognize this goblin. Some people have sleep apnea. Oh shit! Did I look at the goblins? Over 20. 23. Do I find anything interesting on the body? Of toxin? Can I grab those? I've got them. All right, I'm going to rejoin the group. I did not. No, this is not my clan at all. Which is not surprising, since we operated not in this area. No, we did not. I've heard of goblins hanging out with ogres before, and I don't think they're too dissimilar. But we didn't. I think so. It was very rewarding. Yes. I'm only sad that one got away. What do you mean? Do I hate myself? No, I'm cool. I mean, she had wings, so you want to talk about that instead? Well, I know that I'm a goblin. For as long as I've been alive, I haven't felt comfortable in my skin for as long as I can remember. I just feel like I shouldn't be-- I don't fit in with them. It's not just that. This feels wrong, like I should be in a different body. The way they act, and the way they are. It's just not me. They do horrible things to people, and they seem fine with it, but I don't know. I never felt the same as them. It's not that I don't like myself or anything; I think I'm okay. But I just don't like how I feel when I see my hands or my feet. They just feel wrong. I want to be different. Not in my clan, no. But there was someone. I think I was telling you before that they give you a job as soon as you're able to do one. They tried me on so many different jobs. But I was not a soldier, I was not a good cook, I wasn't good at sewing or building. So they stuck me with the torturer. I wasn't the torturer. I was the torturer's assistant. No. I saw a lot of things, and there was a halfling village not far away. They captured someone from the village and they wanted me to kill him. But instead, I was kind to him, and he started talking. My fellow gobbies didn't like that, but they allowed it because I was getting valuable information about where the halflings kept their food, and where they went to harvest, and where we could attack them. But I became friends with him. He was nice. Well, I hope he got away. We left together. It's not important. He was just a nice man. I don't know. He was a chemist, so he taught me about alchemy, and liquids, and potions and things. And he taught me his language. When he had taught me everything he could, they said to kill him. But I didn't want to, so I got real drunk, and I created a distraction, and I hope he got away. I shot one of my fellow goblins in the butt. He yelled a lot. Then we ran off in separate directions, and I've been running ever since. I assume back to his village. Yes, I know, but I don't know, I can't go to that village. I'll be stoned to death. I'm a goblin. You could maybe go. I mean, we're going the opposite direction. I don't know if we should go back. There's too many bad people around there. What if I run into the tribe? What if someone from the village sees me? They hate goblins. Yeah, that was freaky deaky. I know. Yes? I'm okay for now, just getting away from them has been wonderful. And I've met you, Caleb, and you don't seem to care how I look or who I was. Well. Let's just call it a hyphen for now. And maybe we'll move to an ellipsis or something. That's okay. I haven't eaten any children! I have no desire to eat children! But I've seen children being eaten, and goblins are awful. They're terrible in every way. If you're not good, they cut you, or kill you or throw you away. As fast as I could. Being me. I think I was probably stealing some food or something. All right, it was booze. But you know they're not wrong, right? The people who arrested me are not incorrect. If you see a goblin, you should kill it on sight. Yes. Absolutely not. None of them are. I have never met another nice one. Ever. And I really tried! No. It feels like I was in a very average tribe. That would be fine for them, but like I said, this is not me. I don't want to be this. I'm never going to be cool with this. Ever. Too much water. Are we on? What's going on? Sure, let's do that. Thank you, Caleb. I tasted a baby once, just once. I didn't know, they were handing around a bowl. I didn't know what was in it, and then later somebody said there was like-- I mean, they put a bunch of different meat in there. How was I supposed to know that it was like a goulashy thing? Good night. Oh no, you have a thing? Did I miss that in the announcements? Six more battles before we get there.
