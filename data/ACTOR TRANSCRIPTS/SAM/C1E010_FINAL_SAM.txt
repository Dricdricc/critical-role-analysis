For five minutes. We literally just talked about that. Did we talk about the shirts? Disadvantage. First roll of the night. Yeah! (wordless squeal) Me and Pike. Worst rollers in the game. Well, we roll well when it counts. Four. Barrage a cone? Sounds like an Italian porn guy. They've got poison or something. They've got poison magic. No! 8d6?! Jeez. Seems unfair. Oh, you're right. Man, I'm a bad mama jama. Oh! Oh. Sorry, Grog. The fight's over. I'm going, too! Yeah, 420. Maybe Scanlan could use it. I'd like to rage frenzy. Are there any bodies that we can look at? With the party treasury? Oh, sure. What time of day? How long has it been since we rested? Can I remind our party of a couple things? Pike, might be a good time to try to heal Vax's foot again. And also, while we have a moment, did we ever discern what is in that yellow vial? Yeah, do we know what this is? Let me take a look, as well. Ooh, yes. 24. It sounds bad. Bad news. There's a little zombie poo on it. Oh, snap. Get down into frame! Lower into frame. Pull them down. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a bunch of shirts to sell tonight. Oh, what is that thing? Get out of this cave. 11. It's all right. I'll see you next match. Wait! Can we have an aerial battle over water? Let's do it! Him, or me, or both? If only there was a way. I am staying on the carpet. Wait! Is Pike off the carpet? Okay! I will jump off the carpet, grab her, and say, "Pike. Come with me if you want to live." (all laugh) And then I Dimension Door us to the boat. Don't worry! That hard wood is the boat. (all laugh) For now. (shushing) This is the craziest thing ever. This is a James Bond water chase! (all laugh) Oh no. Are those real? (laughs) I rolled a two, but my wisdom is negative two. (all laugh) Oh boy! Instant peril. Is it charming us? Is that a spell? But we're still scared of it. Can you make us faster? Can you haste her, or anything? Just defer. Can you shake us? Can you shake our magic fear? I'm going to attack at disadvantage, I guess, with... I'm going to create a big hand right in front of him, to stall him with the Bigby's Hand. It's this guy I know. His name's Bigby, he has a big hand. I'm going to grapple and try to get it into the water What do I do? What do I roll? I don't know what that is. Is that a six or a nine? It's a nine! 14. Yeah, I'm good. (singing) Talk to the hand! Well, I don't know. Does it fall from gravity, or does it just it stay there, locked in? Okay. Then I'll just lock it there. Oh yeah, I can crush it. Yeah, I also give it a little squeeze. A little tickle. 11 plus five. 16. This is the strongest I've ever been! (all laugh) I've no idea what we're even fighting. "Socket" to me. Oh, I'm going to bring him to the boat. That's a good idea. Maybe move it this way so the people can see. I sing a little song to inspire him. I sing, "When you're trying to skin a cloaker, "here's some inspiration. "When we're on a creepy boat, here's some inspiration. "I want you to be near me--" (speaking) All right, that's it. (all laugh) No, it only lasts ten minutes. (laugh) What if it's just like one of those party cruises where they-- But we don't see it because we're on deck, right? Shark argument! Yeah, what's the layout of the beach? Is it just a beach? Is there a half-submerged Statue of Liberty, or anything? I got a 16 for my perception. What do we do? We've got to get-- someone's going in. Yeah, man! Go in! Light a fire. Let's just light a fire and throw it in there. Yeah, let's just toss a torch. Yeah, we've never shied away from a confrontation before. Indeed. If only we had someone who could go under the ground and be one with the earth and pop up in there and look around-- no? Yeah, but she'll be fine! Oh. Hello. Oh. Okay. Yeah, let's send in one person. I'm going to inspire her with a little dolphin dance or something. Whatever that is. I don't know, I'm just going to-- Maybe they're friendly! Show the people at home. Wait, is she back? Thanks, Ti. But you said it was a gate to another dimension? I we come across any people that we can beat information out of, we might want to ask them if this a known thing, a gateway back to the overworld. Oh, he did already. I've got it. I have a bomb. Maybe. It might hit some of them. Do we want to go in there? Because we can certainly do that. Are we right outside the mouth of the cave right now? Can we get away from the mouth of the cave? T-Money, what do you think? I cast Dispel Magic. Counter-counterspell! No. (all laugh) It's a level 3 spell? Damn it. We have a bomb. I have a bomb. I'm not a good thrower. Is that what you call it, thrower? Then you'll have to hit it to light it. I have a bomb. I don't want to touch it. It's a saddlebag bomb. It's already in! Yes. Never got to use it. He'll light it. A what check? Let's find out. I'm doing this. Nope. He can't. Too late. He's casting like seven spells right now. Let's go in! It was a good bomb. Thank you for crafting it for me. What do I owe you? Maybe start on a new one. Before we plan something, is there a portal or something? 16. I don't think we should camp here. Clarota, is this a possible thing that we should maybe shut down? Could K'Varn send his allies through here? Yeah, that's a good idea. I put a little cologne on the page. Yeah, but it's always a nice gesture. Phone a friend. "Or at least is related to the kin from the other side of the veil." I speak Clarota. While this is going on, I go near Lady Kima and I start humming. I'm going to cast Suggestion on her. Or try to. I'm just going to say, "(singing) Gnome makes you want to check out Grog's bod, "gnome makes you want to check out his bod and sweat him so hard." Yeah. And that's the part I need for shitting on beds, so I apologize. I apologize. I'm sorry. I do call it my antic, but yes. You're right. I'm sorry, that was disrespectful. I apologize. I tried, man, come on. I'm your wingman. Thank you, Vax. I don't think so, Grog. Wow. We get one of those every two episodes! (all laugh) Or sweatshirts. Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex-- It's going to be tight. You know what? Just buy them and then return them after the show's over. (all laugh) We'll take it. Wait, did we sleep? May I see this? (sniffs) Hmm, Draconiar Noir. (all laugh) Are we in the cavern? No, we're on the beach, right? Oh, thank god. Let's sleep. Where do you want to go? Then let's get out of here. Why don't we go to the island and see if we can make camp? What? What's wrong? What are you doing? Oh, okay. Would that help at all? She can do it again tomorrow. True. That's a good impression. All right! So I'll sing to inspire her. "Scry, scry, Miss Keyleth, scry, "put your eyeballs to the K'Varn and tell us why." All right, no, that's it. Yes. You get happiness. Oh, shit. Oh god. A beholder? What's that? Big bad scary thing. Just hold on. Wait. Patience. Yes. What does it do? So it could burn the metal? We could try to just draw him out somehow. Why don't you wait on that. To help us later. The world down here? But we don't have corruption. Oh, I can mock. That took months. Months. Well, let's take Kima's advice and maybe start with a little reconnaissance. We'll get closer, we'll rest for the night, and maybe send in a snooping party. Wasn't the point of us going to these beaches to try to see if there was any other advantage we could find? All right. I don't think I can do that. I can banish a being, but not a beam. Should we go to one more beach before we all die? Because it'll be that much closer tomorrow. We can do reconnaissance from there. We still have to get across this body of water. You said there's something swimming down there. Oh, we're going over? By boat? Is that what's happening? Are the rest of us flying? We're flying. We did this already. Okay, so we're over the water? Pus. Can we go inspect those structures up there? I turn invisible. Let's go scout it out. So we make our way up to the structure. Nope. Three. That was my advantage. The first one was a one. (all laugh) Wait, plus two! That makes it five. Oh, plus ten! That's 15! A recent campsite? Or one big thing. (singing) There are giants in the sky. I'm invisible. Okay. Didn't make it. Didn't make it to K'Varn, didn't make it to the shirts. That was the stoner-est thing you've ever said. Bard! Yeah! That's us. We should do "loins encouraged" and "violence girded," no? What?! LAURA AND Liam, did you just buy 20 shirts? Yeah why stop at 1,000? Let's go for 2,000. (all laugh) Those are great! Love the song parodies! On a "side night!" Wait, what's that name? MATT AND Oh, I like that. No, that's good. I love my wife. Entschuldige. I don't know what that is. A thousand dollars. Yes. Got ten minutes, tops. Is that what one of the things was? It's a lot like life. (all laugh) We needed to come up with a name. Some people didn't think that it was-- So we had to come up with something less provocative. I think I'm neutral good. I don't remember. I don't think it's on my sheet. What should I be, Matt? Yeah, but that was a game thing. That wasn't a character thing. How does anyone do anything? A lot of stuff for Matt. I do not think I look like Tim Curry. (all laugh) This is my first time playing. Who's the youngest? Probably Marisha. She's, like, 16. I think I'm the oldest. October 9th. 38. When's your birthday? Someone asked many questions. "When did Pike and Scanlan start flirting?" Or, "When did Scanlan start flirting with Pike?" Right from the beginning. Donatello's my favorite Ninja Turtle. Advice for bards is sing loud, and sing proud. Or play your flute or whatever. Bard out with your heart out. No! We're all going to die! Oh, yes, guys, by the way. Ashley and I are dating in real life. Yeah, no, we've been together for a couple of years now. It feels like it. "We'll see?" Come on, give me a hint! George Clooney, anybody? Let's wait two minutes until the feed catches up. Oh, not the president Barack Obama, some other guy. (deep voice) Jon Snow! Garfunkel and Oates, yeah. Bards. They could be bards! Troy Baker? I don't know. Sasha Gray. Troy Baker. Porn star, yeah. Hey, I have a question. I have a question for the DM. Is there a spell or a portal or anything out there where we can all switch bodies with each other? And I'm Keyleth for a while, and Taliesin is Grog for a while? I don't know, it could be cool! I want to do that. You would rage. I've heard of him. You could buy a new shirt. That's a season two thing. Permanently? Some of us have been in comas every other session. How do I get an emote? What's the weirdest thing Grog's ever done as a character? Troll dick stuff... No, wait! He went and humped a fairy in another-- Yeah, what happened up there? That was fun. We used dried poo to blind the king a few episodes ago. He did? If you want to put my face on every character, that's cool. Third purple nipple? And the donkey dong? Our six-hour games were pretty bad. No, I love this. I write all my songs from scratch. (all laugh) (laughs) Yeah, pretty soon. I'm working on an album. Yeah, we'll be in the studio. It's just me changing the words to contemporary songs, but making them about Dungeons & Dragons, and I'll grow my hair like Weird Al. (quiet war cry) No Holds Bard. That's good. Or Mr. Rogers? I rolled the fudge. We'll find out. Maybe he'll be super easy. You'll find out when that guy gets to his room. (all laugh) What happens at level 20? He's coming back soon. Gilmore! I can't wait. What is it, Gilmore's Glorious Goods? MARISHA AND Oh, yeah! There's a Christmas episode. Oh my god. That's daunting. Never read it. Never saw it. Don't know anything about it. Seriously. Don't know anything about it. Don't know anything about it. Is that like a-- I'm waiting to read it to my son. Okay, bye, guys. (all laugh) Good night. We haven't gone to the keep yet, have we? Slytherin. (all laugh) Are Scanlan's feelings for Pike mutual? Pike, come on, give us a hint. Wait, what? I never heard this in two years! Well, maybe Scanlan has somebody else in mind, as well. (all laugh) There's a chance? I could change your heart with enough spells. What does that mean? I think, for me, I enjoyed springing Keyleth out of jail by convincing the guards she had pubic lice. Before the show. Oh, okay. You were crazy. We had a whole Phoenix Wright party. New character would be rough, man. Can I come back as Spider-Man or something? Risk. Pretty good! I would accept a small statue of Pike that I can hold near my breast. I did have one made in-game-- I made two. I made one of me that I gave to you, and one of you that I keep with me. Pay Per View. No. No, it's a totally different Scott White. Oh, yeah. Bye, guys!
