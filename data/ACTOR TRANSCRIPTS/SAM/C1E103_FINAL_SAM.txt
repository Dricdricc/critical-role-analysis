So one day for those. You'll have lots of time after this, Liam! Nothing. The power's out at my house! Just distracted because I just came from my house, and the power was out, that's all. I'm worried about my kids. Are they going to have their little fans on tonight to keep them cool? Are they going to light candles in their room? I don't know! They are definitely watching Twitch. Maybe, if they can find the living room. It's dark! Oh yeah, they have their wine aerator. They each have their cell phones. They're okay. (laughter) I walk up to her and I set down his armor and don't say anything. There's nothing left. He was obliterated. Is it all diamonds? It-- Yes. It could be Vecna, watching us. Wait, can I take a closer look at it and see if I can, I don't know, identify it somehow? No, but can I just see? Sure. Two! Plus five. Can I try to remove it from the ocular cavity? Yeah. My tiny, ocular hands. Nine. I can inspire myself, I suppose. Two, right? I didn't Cutting Words anyone. Those count as inspiration, right? I'll inspire myself just to give it a serious try. That's plus ten, so that's a 19 plus, I guess, three for Jack of All Trades? 22. Oh no! Insta-death. No, I'm not. Oh, is this magic? Do I get advantage? Way better, but still terrible. 12! A one! 13. It's the same thing, so it's 13. Can I see? It was speaking to me. I don't exactly remember, but it had some really strong arguments. I guess, yeah. It was offering me things. It was telling me it could help. I've never felt that way before. It was amazing. Can you try? Is it beneath the ground? Is it invisible? It burrowed! I don't trust that thing. I mean, I don't trust it near us. Percy, I think you need to give it to me to hold. No, I can take care of it better than you. Just give it to me. Trust me. I want revenge on this eye. Give it to me so I can get revenge! I think I should hold it. What if it can still hear us? Sense where we are? That is true. That is a very good point. If we rest, I may be able to make them. How big is that? But how big? How many? I can make them. We just need an animal. As much as the animal. I mean, I know you're grieving, but we could give Trinket up for this. It was worth a try. Taking out a loan? To buy diamonds? We could try mine first, and if it doesn't work-- but I need to rest. I can't do anything today. Give it to me. I'll take care of it. I'll send it away to a place where only I can get it. But it's a personal plane. It's my plane. I am not. I don't know how this works. My daughter taught me this spell; I've never used it before. It goes into a little pocket dimension! Is what she told me. I don't even know what that means! Here, let's try something. Just give me something, I'll send it there now. I don't know what that'll do. Give me Trinket. I can't do Trinket. It has to be less than five pounds. Yes. Yeah. Give me anything. Sure! All right. I will use Wrist Pocket! I don't know where they are! I literally have no idea, but watch this! I don't know how I even do that! No! The eye! I can get rid of the eye! Maybe we should vote on this. Should we give it to me? Who says aye? I don't have that much. I don't have enough. Aren't you low, Pike? Like 11 or something. I turn him into diamonds. No, it can work on anything, I think. I've never turned anything into diamonds. You're right. In retrospect, I should have been doing this literally every day. I just learned the spell a week ago. Yeah, but look at this! It's gone! It's back! Cool, right? You guys need more healing? I could try to give us more. She says to a nearby tree. I can't try anything today. No. Everybody but Grog? A whole new show. By the way, audience, Travis pointed out as we left, they might not know what we were talking about when we all said, "oh, we're going to jack off now." It means unplug our microphone cords. We're not-- Why was Liam crying in the hallway? Jacking in. I can verify that none of us listened or read anything about what just happened. We were jacking off the whole time. (laughter) You need to rest. You've got to get your spells back, man. (whispering) Get on that. (laughter) It's Powder from the movie Powder. What has happened? Just come down. She's a doctor. It's fine. It's three BPM. I've got one perception. Oh, it's passive. Good morning! I come down and join everybody. I look in my pocket to where I was keeping the dust that was Vax. Is there anything there? This is you. I feel like I should still keep this. Wait, have we tried-- hey. Can you cut your hand? Do you bleed? How did this happen? You made a deal with your god, or something? If we defeat him, do you go away? So if we win, you lose. Well, that's a brave choice. I don't mind it. It's fine. We have Vax now. No matter what happens later, this was a brave choice. I'm not sure I would have made the same, but we're stronger together, and thank you for coming back. It's a harder choice to come back. It's easier to walk away. I know this. Thank you for coming back. Maybe this will make you more fun to be around, too. You used to have this death wish, but now it's done. Now you pop a beer. It's his birthday. He can do whatever he wants. Wow. Ice cold. It's super greedy. (laughter) Oh, good. You think we should call out to the werewolves for what purpose? We were going to buy your soul back for a lot of diamonds. Just because? If we go back, where are we going? Where were we? Who? Go? Would we be accepted there? I've done some things in my life that are less than heavenly. That's true. Is her symbol attuned? I was gone. A religion check? 14. Do I add my jack-of-all? 17. The Moon Weaver? The Moon Weaver. A god that I've heard of once, and therefore will pledge my eternal allegiance to. No, we're god-spitballing here. I have an Ioun Stone. But I've been praying to Sarenrae lately. They don't care, right? We should start with one god and see how it goes. Do we all get tattoos? (singing) We need a god-tage! ASHLEY and Wait, we're just going to go? Can I inspire myself? I don't know. It's ability checks, only. Nine. Holy shit. What happened? What's going on? Where are we? Who am I? What happened? What's going on? Totally. He was dead a second ago. Now he's alive. I draw my whip. I whip him in the face. I'm whipping Vax. He's not real. He's an illusion. He's an illusion! Two! (laughter) I don't know! It shouldn't have hurt that much. We are? We were just fighting a god. Oh god. His testicles hung so low! Yours. Or something. You know the distance? Sonoma. Wait, are we taking the hybrid? Where are we going? She's beautiful. With you, Grog? Just the two of us, wandering through a city together? Do I see what? You're right. I should go with him. All right, let's go. We'll see you at the temple. Don't go to heaven without us. All right. It's an IUD. (laughter) Of course not. You mean the old scroll? We're in the House of Lady Favors of Renewal right now. Is there a calendar system? No? That's a good impression. She can be that way. I got it the first time. (laughter) Because you were afraid or because she said you can't? Conscience. Did you get wishes? Did he thank you? Wait! He took your cards and he left? On him. Just so I'm clear. We're going to go, grab him, steal his wishes, leave him in a ditch somewhere. Is that the plan? What's our game here? What's our game? What are we trying to get? Okay, so our game is to intimidate him into having him give you one of the wishes back. What happened to the deck of cards? Why are we going back to get-- oh! He has more wishes! Not more cards, he has more wishes! And he should give one to us. What would you wish for? You don't seem enthusiastic about that wish. That's a better wish for you, for sure. And we have two of them. That's true. It'd be nice having you around for a bit. Peace on-- Yeah, well, probably. Do you just get one wish? Because I could be a littler taller, a little buffer. What would I wish for? Take this hat, it's the Hat of Disguise. Put it on, and you can look however you want to look. Well, then never mind that. I'm sorry! You're throwing a lot at me! All right. What do we need to intimidate him? Do you need me to be your enforcer? You already look amazing. Yeah. Take this hat and put it on. (laughter) Are they approaching us? The popo. We haven't done anything wrong, we're just talking on the street! We're just two guys! Yeah! We haven't done any magic! Oh no. What did you do? I wasn't there! (laughter) Oh my god. We're going to have to kill some guards, aren't we? (laughter) Me? I just met this man. I've never seen him before in my life. Thank you for coming over here. He was holding me hostage. He wouldn't let me leave. I'm a small man. I'm defenseless, and he was holding me captive. Deception. Okay, 24. Gerald Butler. (laughter) We just were walking down the street! What happened? This is racial profiling. You or me? All right. All right. I will, I guess-- Jesus. It all seems so stupid. All right, I will use some gigantic spell for no reason. I can help me fine, it's you I need to deal with. Sure, but I don't know what he knows! I don't know anything! All I know is he came over and fingered you. All right. I will-- Jesus. Okay. Fuck! I don't know what to do without causing everyone around us to die or be scared! All right! Is there a leader? What did this other one look like? Yes, the other one, what did he look like? Metallic-looking? You mean, the one we just saw around the corner? The super scary one? Please believe us. There is an even bigger danger coming, and I think-- oh yes, it's right there. And I will Major Image what I think he's describing, which is a tall Iron Man. 20-- lots. 27. Oh, he didn't look like this before? It's much worse? Yes, it's much worse! Don't kill him. We'll all die! Horns make him angrier! And I'll make the image go crazy with rage. The only way to calm it down is if we slowly walk away in different directions. (laughter) Okay. 24. It's a 20. Should we turn ourselves in? They started this war. We're finishing it. Are there any buildings around here? (sighs) You're bigger. All right, I will do the old classic. I'm going to Polymorph Grog into a giant eagle. The old standby. The giant eagle trick, if you'll accept it. Sure. Yeah. I've got nothing. Nope. What do I add? Nothing, right? Saving throw. Okay. 19. More for that one. 17. More. Oh, you can't talk. Shit. Land us in an alley somewhere, and we'll change our appearance, I suppose. Run along, now. I release Polymorph. You didn't tell me that the guards all hated you. You're right. We've learned a lesson today. I feel like that ship has sailed. Maybe not. (sighs) Maybe we should go find the others. I know where it is. I've shat there before. (laughter) Why don't I just make us both invisible? Sure. All right. 3rd-level Invisibility, right? I can do me and another person? (clears throat) It was the guard. It's us. We're here. We're next to you, but we're invisible. Not exactly. There was an incident, in which we scared many innocent people and assaulted several guards, and they shot us with crossbows, and we are bleeding. I'm over here, actually. (laughter) Wait, we're going to the Ashari? What happened with Sarenrae? We're just getting a message to them? Pretty cool. Dungeon Master, where's Vasselheim on this map? All the way up here? And didn't his internal compass say 350 miles northwest? So we kind of know where he is, right? Northwest? Oh, so it's up at the peak? Maybe up here. There's a real map here. We're still invisible. How far we've come. We couldn't even walk across town! For sure. Now we know. How are we going to get you those wishes? Yeah, and only one of us is an undead ghost now. One more day. Happy birthday, Matthew. He quit.
