(whispering) Thanks. Thanks. Yeah. Oh no, I'll take it off. I sort of knew in the back of my head, right? No, I was courting her. No, it's true. (laughter) Armored? Like with armor? Oh my god, right away, right away. We're just in it. Just like that. That's it? 11. What the fuck is that? That's a thing you made up. (mocking) I don't want to, I don't want to move! It's looking pretty beat up. Could've been bad, could've been bad. Who's in front of me? I'm not going to be a dick. I brush past Trinket so I can see the worm. Okay I hold up my cone, my Hand Cone of Clarity, and I will cast Eyebite. Singing to it (singing) Scanlan's eyes are biting you. Making you very sick. Ooh, Scanlan's eyes are biting you. Scanlan's eyes! All right, so the Eyebite refers to my eyes. He doesn't need eyes. He doesn't need to be able to see me, I have to be able to see him, right? It works. Okay, so I'm going to do Sicken. I will inspire Vex. With a limerick. I once knew a bear named Trinket, and would often tell you he stink-et, but you were appalled, so you kicked me in the balls, and now I don't say it, I just think it. (laughter) I feel bad for this thing. Second attack? Cubes, really. Oh, but you know what? I have really good dexterity. He's only rolling a d2. He's rolling a d2. I'm not within 30 feet. Oh my god, the worms have turned us all into clouds! It was so good. Not all short people look alike. That would have been great. (laughter) Well, dispel your own shit. I'm going to use Cutting Words to try and not have it hit me. I'll sing, (singing) do you really want to hurt me? Do you really want to bite my body? Okay, that taunts him. A d10. this one? Wait, that's yours; why am I doing yours? 28 is what it rolled total?! Oh fuck, even if I rolled a ten, I couldn't do anything. I rolled a three. I'm great at those. Dexterity saving throw. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, that's a five. Tell me this, Dungeon Master. Earlier when I had done my Eyebite thing, I had my cone up here. When he grabbed me was the cone still close to my mouth? Okay. Concentration check. Concentration? I've never rolled for concentration. Oh wait! I have advantage on spell concentration. Well, that wasn't good either. So one was a five and one was a ten. Do I add anything to that? Constitution. So 12. Okay. Great. I don't want be in here anymore. Can I look around? It's dark. It seems cozy. Seems nicer than outside right now, actually. I dip my finger in the acid. Ooo! It's not good. So I'm going to make him barf me up. Where's the d8s? 19 is my save. What's that? I've already lost count. 15 plus seven. Whatever that is. Wait 6d8, yeah okay. Okay. But it did hurt it, yes? Can't you just kill it? Wait a second, hold on a second. Like a Three Stooges thing. Vex, you and me babe, all we got to do is last ten rounds. Of course, all you hear is (muffled cries). She's the only one who's got arms and legs right now. What worm? My worm? You could have hit me! It's okay. Don't worry. She doesn't even know-- Hey! Nice job, Pike! That halved? Wait. Doesn't my worm take it too? Still alive? Can I juggle while I'm a mist? Don't do this, don't do this! What were you going to say, Matt? This is a reverse ad for Fight Club Five. If you want to. You can Dimension Door; I keep forgetting that! I'm in a nice womb. Aren't I immune to acid damage? Because of the feast? Isn't that the same thing? Concentration check. Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. 18 and 19. It's going down. So it has poison, right? It's poisoned me-- Oh, it has acid. Can I make an intelligence check to see if I know anything about these creatures? Is that my action? No, it's... Specifically what I'm trying to remember from my encounters in the past is if it has any resistance to poison damage. What am I doing? Intelligence? 16. 16. But it does use poison? Oh, gotcha. Okay, so it probably does have poison resistance. Okay. Well, I'm in a tunnel, right? He disappeared down-- well, I don't know anything! Okay, all right, I can feel him moving, so I don't know where I am anymore. So I don't want to Dimension Door out, because I don't know where I'd end up. So instead I will cast Stinking Cloud inside-- No, no, no! No. No, no. Cancel! Belay that order! Shit! Because I think he's immune to poison, so I'm not going to do that. I'm going to-- Fuck! There's nothing I can do! (strained) I'm like this right now. I can't do anything. I am My Left Foot. Yeah, I can't reach a wand. I don't want to get rid of-- But I don't know where I'd end up? So even if I've moved since I saw it last, I can still Dimension Door to where I think--? Okay, then I will do that. I will do that. I want to appear where Vex was before. Goo! Goo all over me! Ew! Oh, and then I see-- I've seen the other worm before, right? And I get my bearings, and I can see Pike, I can see Trinket. So I will shake it off, I will inspire Keyleth and say, (singing) I only want to see you slicing up that purple worm! Ooh! Okay, that's good. Hey man, whatever. Necrotic damage? Best kind. Even with its disadvantage? Lot of things going on in Matt Mercer's head right now. Killed Vax. Ah, me? oh. Hello, hello. (laughs) I will kill it with fire. Well, let's see, can I see Vax over there in the worm juice? Then I'll kill it with fire. I will use my Wand of Fireballs to blast balls at it. My balls of fire, and I won't hit Key, will I? Oh, it's that radius! Forget it, I'll just do Lightning Bolt instead. So I take two steps to my right, so no one else is in the line and I will lightning it instead. 8d6, yeah? 31. (whimpers) Do I still have any movement? I'm going to try to shuffle back into the tunnel there a little bit. And for my bonus, I'll Healing Word myself. Okay, what is that, d4? Great, yeah, six points. Awesome. So you mean, Trinket is doing what Trinket always-- Who you talking to, Grog? Sorry! These are probably the only ones! It's a male and a female! Yeah! They were married! They're a married couple! They hate each other! I'm here? What? Oh you mean, I'm going to get the gold?! I don't have a Bag of Holding! I weigh 14 pounds! I can't hold that much gold! Gold is heavy! Yes, we want fucking gold! Wait, isn't there gold all over the place? I'll assist. Grog, Grog! Open the bag! (singing) Bigby's Hand will grab the gold. (laughter) Who, me? Nature check? Are your hands dripping with blood right now? It could be an unrelated seismic event. I smack myself with Bigby's Hand. Technically, he's not an honorable man. But we should be. It's their nature. We were checking it out to see if it was safe. Should we report this to the officials and try to quarantine the house, destroy it, something? Just destroy the portal, destroy the teleportation circle. Take the gold, or the house? TRAVIS and What does Pike think about that? Don't condescend to Pike. Because we're better than that. Let's count our money first before we make that decision. But I'm mainly concerned what Pike feels about taking control of this evil, evil house. It's got an evil, mysterious gem-eye looking at us right now. All right. If in claiming it we can get someone, some sort of religious person in here to clear it for us, making sure that it's-- Pike would be an option. We're leasing with an option to buy. Take the skull? Oh shit, the whispers. If you haven't read the comics, check it out on geekandsundry.com. And don't forget! If someone's whispering in your ear, it's probably the sound of your conscience saying "Go buy a T-shirt!" Guys, this is the rest of the show. Whose evil? That voice is usually me. Kiss him on the mouth. (laughter) What? Put it in the Bag of Holding? LAURA and Yeah, that might look a little weird. Well, that's creepy. Can we take it to someone; who do we know? Not Gilmore, this is beyond-- If only we had some way to magically transport to Whitestone. Yes. We do. Could you go? Yes, you. We could send Pike with it? Wait, we're going to sleep with this skull in our house? You didn't turn me into a cloud. You by yourself? All right. Oh. We'll leave the skull with Uriel. After you've been corrupted by it? We'll leave the skull in this house-- Wait, that part's true? Who told you that? Oh, in addition to the wish? Oh. It's like a genie. Oh, this is weird. We need some help on this. No. It will hypnotize us and corrupt us. We'll go on a quick pub crawl. Before we all part ways, can we do a quick accounting of the gold? All right. Fair enough. Yes. Actually, while you were gone-- And I cast Friends on him. While you were gone, other guards came by and said we were clear to go in. Natural 20. We're here to report a security concern of the utmost importance and urgency to you. Are we among friends here and free to talk in front of everyone? We've been alerted to some evil afoot in your kingdom yet again. The former Krieg's homestead has been vacant for a while and apparently has a portal to an evil realm inside. We went to investigate, acting on a tip from-- Yes. Our informant told us as much. We don't want to give his name. It's extremely magically dangerous. They should not set foot inside the place at all. Will you notify us when she returns? Is there anything else? Just real quick before we leave. I'm sorry. I think I had a burrito. Can I just use a facility inside? A restroom or something? Thank you. Just wait out of earshot. They closed the doors? I've been in the throne room before? Do you have eyes on them? All right. Give me ten minutes. I sit down on the WC. No, I don't. Instead, I Polymorph into a fly, and I'm going to fly my way to the throne room. Of the throne room? The doors are closed, yes? Is there any gap at all? Okay, I'm going to crawl in there. Dexterity? Oh, no, someone's got a fly swatter! Ten? That one's full. The one that I tried to go into? It's full and it needs a big cleaning. I thought there was another one this way. Not through there, or anything? All right. Carry on, then. You should send someone up to service it, though, right away. It's a matter of security. Okay. Two lefts and a right, and I'm out? Thank you. Shat all over my plans. Let's go home, I guess. The drummer? Did they say why? For a performance? All right, good to know. Thanks, Zed. I'd like to, very much, but I don't know how. We can't just barge in there and break someone out of jail. We're known people. It's customs, not sheriff. Yeah, but they could make the problem worse. She's quite special to me. I think we should-- I think I should go and try to get her out. Not, not in that way. (laughter) I'm not interested in her in that way. Things have changed. She's a good person and she deserves much better than the likes of me-- It's a rather large cube, but, listen, all right, she's-- she's-- we're related. We're related. And I don't just mean-- She's a Shorthalt. Like a baby. Like a baby Shorthalt. (high-pitched 'hee' sound) Listen, don't spread the word around. I don't want my cred to be ruined, but... she's my little girl. I didn't know this, this is new information. I'm still just adjusting to it. No I didn't. No, I did not! I did not try and sleep with her. I think deep down inside, some part of me knew, which is why I gave her all that gold. I think. No! Oh, Grog, please! (laughter) I mean, I always knew that was a possibility, in the trade I deal in. All right. Easy. Listen, drummer-- You can be replaced easily. When I played with them, we had seven drummers in two years. And I killed two of them. (laughter) No, just stay and shut up. Yes, I don't quite know how to act or behave now. And I'm going through a crisis of conscience and identity. I'm sorry; I'm off my game right now. But she's related to me. I don't know. Okay, all right. I'm not good with this stuff. I haven't done this before, all right? I haven't really had family for much of my life. And this is a new thing and it's going to take me some time to adjust and figure out what this means for me. All right? I've defined most of my life by the people I've slept with and now, this a new part of me that I have to figure out. I would like to. But I'll need some help, probably. I don't know if we can all go barge in there. (laughs) Thanks, Vex. Trinket, I'm okay for right now. But maybe you can help best by staying here and looking after the drummer here and making sure. I know it's late in the day, but I wouldn't mind going right away. Does anyone want to join me? Probably just a smaller party. Don't we have business to attend to here? Gold to count and-- Well to get out of a stockade, we'll need some cunning. And cunning-- And cunning. I wish Vax were here. You know what, we are but they have a range. Come in, Vax. Earth to Vax. Tune in Tokyo. He's gone to Whitestone! Percy, I need you for your words, and Keyleth for your magic. Let's go. Sure, if you've got a little left for me. Wait, I can give us-- We can go back. Tchotchkes. Oh, there's multiple stockades. He got nabbed, too, didn't he? All right, thanks. What happened? Why is she in jail? What's the fine? Was she injured in any way? All right. Thank you. You won't be needed here anymore. You guys can leave. Oh yes, all right. Percy. What do you think our play is here? Should we go in and pay? Should we do a bit of a ruse? You still have your Hat of Disguise, right? Well, you could be a guard taking me in there. Yeah, but it's fun, though? No, no, you're right, we should just go in and talk. Oh, all right. So you think just walk on in there. No subterfuge, no sneaky-sneaky, no breaking down doors? Who said that? Oh, okay, hi. Are you lying to me to get me to pay you for a new gun? All right, I'll give you what you need. I do. 20? You don't have 20 gold? Oh, Jesus. (laughter) He's an ambassador. I just throw Dranzel a quick little wink. You heard the ambassador; please leave. (laughter) You'll watch what you say about her. Your majesty, are you sure you don't want to write a check from the treasury? I've got the checkbook with me. We could just write a check. (whispers) Your brand of subterfuge is not what I had in mind. (laughter) I could have picked anyone to be with me here. Not this. You're rubbing my face in it because I threw your gun in the lava. Warden. This is just like this bastard. He always goes around trying to boss people around and throw his money around. And I turn and I punch Percy in the face. Oh, shit. Going for another one. A nine. Probably not. I don't have any strength. One, so that's ten. And then I turn around, and I punch a guard. 13. I've just had enough with all of you people. We performers demand respect and deserve it as well. I've just had it up to here with being bossed around by people like him. It would. Great. Diplomatic immunity. You should blame me for this. I'm sorry. I just had a really shitty day, all right? He doesn't deserve this. Let him go. Just take me. Did I hear that? Good idea. Thanks, Percy, for your help. Huh? Oh. All right. You could say so. I heard you had quite a night last night at the bar. Apparently you're very good at it. I saw-- I got a glimpse of your victims over there. Yep, you're right about that. Stay away from all men. Forever. I know that feeling. Listen, I've come to get you out of here. Don't worry. I've still got some tricks up my sleeve. Just wanted to make sure you're all right. Did they hurt you in any way? You think now? All right, is anyone watching? I'll need a distraction. Do you think you can come up with one? You'll have to teach me that trick. And then I Dimension Door us out onto the street. All right. Let's get out of here. Percy, I didn't wait quite until nightfall. All right, we'll catch up. Oh, shit! Burn it down! Burn the stockades down! Good thinking. Oh, shit. That's not-- She figured it out, Grog. Yes. Yes, it is. They're all right. They've got their good qualities, too. It's not here yet. I'm going to check my bed just to see if there's any shit on it. Clang! I'm supposed to lay low, though. I have only-- I gave 50 to Percy, which you didn't use. Including the silverware? Oh, great. All right, here's 50. Go get us a decent set of silverware. Vax never came home last night? Should we be worried? We should torture him to find out. Oh my god! Yes. Is the skull going to be safe here while we're gone? Can it see inside our keep? Can it channel some beast? But not secure magically. What if it's a portal? What if it can send a dragon to us, or a worm or something? If you, if you go there, take the stone from his sister and you can come right back. Well, let's not lie to Percy's sister. (laughs) We keep summoning Allura to solve our magical problems. We brought her to Whitestone and now we're bringing her back? All right... Hey, you used it yesterday for no reason, too. (laughter) We're leaving the skull? (laughing) Let's at least post Jarett here. Do you ever sleep, Jarett? You're so cool. Why don't you just take it from my money? Can I swing by Gilmore's and just see if he or-- Sherri works there? Sherri works there, if they're around? Two things. One, when he returns, he made me a potion, a while back. I'm running a bit low. It was a scrying sort of thing. When he gets back, maybe he can whip me up another batch for next time I come pay a visit, but also-- oh, yes? Oh! Yes, I was just going there now. All right, we'll save business for another day. I just wondered-- I may want to try to find someone at some point tonight. I don't know how. Yes, but a different sort, a less fecal sort. I don't know how to scry, I don't know how to find someone or what I need. I may have a hair strand or two, but I don't have much to go on. All right. Absolutely. You lead! Oh! Oh, Grog! Oh, Jesus! It's the Wizard of Oz! (radio DJ voice) Don't forget to subscribe to Geek and Sundry, so you can see archives of the show and many others! I don't even know-- Remember, Liam doesn't really hate Travis in real life! (laughter) We can't fight four dragons. Can we? There's a red and a black, a white and a green. Oh, hi, dragon! Don't worry, I'll kill it with music. My god, look at all those fuckers! 13. 19 misses? Wait, how do I do anything to it? Jesus Crit! I was in there as well, I think. This is a constitution saving throw? Can I use Cutting Words on this? Is this a magical effect? No, wait. Oof! Oh yeah! (laughs) I'm right there already! All right, you had it. Me? I'm going to-- Where is he? 12. Okay, I will-- (sings) Bigby's Hand! Shamone! I will Bigby's Hand and put it right in front of him and-- wow, it's so tiny compared to him! (laughter) And I'll-- shit. I guess, I mean, who's near him? Just Grog right? They'll get away right, they're going to run? You're going to run, right? They'll be fine. All right. I'll inspire Grog by saying, you're a magnificent, handsome bastard, don't die! Grog, did you get hit? Great, that'll help. Don't worry, my magical hand is there. (laughs) Hey, but, I try to stop him! Got a strength of 26. With inspiration. (laughing) What is that thing? (laughs) The tree has been evaporated. Oh, hells yes! Me and Pike get there, because I Dimension Door us. Maybe they just want their gold back? I don't remember that. (whispering) Chroma Conclave, that's so cool! Oh, we're okay! Hey guys, it's fine. Just get to the keep-- we can talk about it there. You know, maybe the warden of that jail was a dragon! And he invited his friends to find us. But think of the 4,000 gold we got! (laughs) We'll find out. Not everyone, just a couple of dozen people. And Gilmore.
