I'm our second sponsor. (laughter) No. Welcome, new viewers. Every week-- or many weeks, I am charged with writing the ad for the sponsor of that week. I did this one way back in mid-December, so it'll feel a little stale. (laughter) I'll write another one for Easter, I promise. (laughter) It smells really nice. And, when we get canceled, this is going to be a great dining room table. That one. It's a real poster? Oh, wow! Can you photoshop out my crotch region? I don't really remember it. On a Thursday? An extra eight hours to spend every Thursday. There's one more announcement. That's not a real name! What a night. Well, guys... Can we open our fricking books yet? There will be no test. Were we supposed to prepare this? So far you're just talking about current Liam. Yeah. Um. I am a little goblin girl. (laughter) Oh. Nott the Brave. (high-pitched Cockney accent) Oh! You're finally awake, I see. Oh yeah, motherfuckers. It's on. You were out for quite some time, there. Rough day, eh? No, I mean, usually you're so good at everything, but yesterday you were just-- maybe you needed the sleep, is what you needed. Well, don't thank me yet. I should probably tell you what happened while you were asleep. I mean, you were asleep for so long. I got bored, frankly. I was going through my pack and reorganizing. Well, I mean, many people? I got bored. You've never slept that long, so I left, I went downstairs, I thought I'd do a bit of window-shopping, and you know how sometimes I get the itch, you know? I'm here, aren't I? Yeah, I did. But I might have been spotted by a few of the Crown's Guard. No? No, I didn't. But they didn't catch me, so. Listen, I'm sorry, sometimes I get the urge, I've got to take something, you know? I was trying to replentish what you lost yesterday, and I failed. I know, I'm sorry. Yeah. I know. You're right. Yep. I just got a little bit squiggly. That's all. Yeah, good idea, Caleb. Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. Ah, no problem. Yeah, well, we'll do better today, right? Yeah, I'm starving. Let's go down, get some food. I'll come with you, 'cause as you said, we're better together. And we'll take it from there. You need some books and stuff, right? All right, well, that's on the to-do list. Yes, yeah, so I have a half a mask that covers my goblin face, and with the hood over, kind of obscures. Maybe it's not a goblin, maybe it's a little halfling person or something. What do we roll for? (laughter) You know, meat if you have it, but if you don't, that's okay, too. Potatoes, or bacon if it's on the menu, but really anything-- I have a little left in my flask. Just a couple swigs. I mean, if you don't want me to get too jittery, yeah. All right. I remove my little mask, and then just go (eating noises). (laughter) What's that? What's your name? (sings 'Bad to the Bone') (laughter) She's your treasurer? Don't arouse suspicion, but did you hear all that coin hit that table, Caleb? Yes, but we could follow them out. We could do the Moneypot. We could run Rat Food. We could do Prince and the Pauper to get it from them. We could try Spider Eyes. Any of those could work-- Don't move. Don't move. Tieflings can only see movement. Morning. I know Halfling, right? Yes. I'll shout back, top of the morning to you. (laughter) We've got-- free coffee? Yeah, yeah, I'll take it. Sure. Thank you. He said "Jest". Two, please, right away. Yeah, you're right, you're right. In Halfling, I'll say to Beau-- Are you in town for business or pleasure? You're asking me what I'm saying. I think I do. Yeah, yeah, but you don't have to make a big thing of it, all right? There could be people here who don't know. That's concern. Look at this fucking game! (laughter) I'm going to just keep my eyes open for any tricks of the hand, sleight-of-hand-y-type tricks. Okay. Perception. 14. Ashley confirmed worst hype-man ever. (laughter) Yeah, yeah, it sounds like a good night. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Hey, Matt. Dungeon master. They're wearing what they described. They're not wearing any cloaks or anything right now, are they? Do I recognize those cloaks? Maybe I saw something. I don't know. I didn't see them last night? Okay. Interesting. Caleb knows everything about magic. He's been even teaching me some. He's real good. You should see him-- He could if he wanted to. He's really good at magic. He can make a cat appear and disappear whenever he wants. That's not all he can do. Caleb, tell them all the stuff you can do. It's really impressive! With magic? Like what? Not to me, not to me! Well, you're both magic-users, then. And so is the larger fellow? I'm sorry, what Academy are we talking about? The Soul Train Academy. He reads lots of books, Caleb does. He's very smart. In fact, should we go looking for more right now? I think ancient people would call it a holster as well. You don't have a lot of money, then? Oh. Which one? No, I haven't. It's a game? Cards? All right. I might like to know that. Yes, I would like to know that. Oh, right now? Is this okay? 3d6. Got one. I'm not you. I have one of each dice. (laughter) I'm out. (laughter) Thank you, Caleb. Thank you. I'm going to try to change one of my cards. Without you seeing. 12 plus eight, so that's 20. This is my only skill, guys. Oh, shit. Do I notice her? Nope. No, I rolled three. I'm out. Should I? Caleb, do you have any more? Okay, got it. I got a pair of fours. I draw my shortsword. (laughter) Acrobatics? 24. You're cheating. Somehow you're cheating. I'm sorry. That was stupid. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. Your Laura is showing. (laughter) I need another drink. It's fun. She's just a couple of wild and crazy guys over here. (laughter) That's real. Well, there's that board on the wall. Has anything new been posted on the board? That doesn't sound interesting to me at all. Wasn't it a delivery thing? Fuck that. You did that? We said no to that job, thank you. I don't know about that. That sounds risky, I don't know. To have these weirdos with us? Yes. Well, I suppose if we surrounded ourselves with weirdos, then maybe it would take some of heat off of me. Oh, Jesus, she's going to kill me right now. (laughter) Thank you. That's very nice. No one is after me! That's a 14, except negative three to performance. So 11. I am lying. I am definitely on the run from someone. That's a good fucking question. Did I make it? (laughter) Oh, that's cool. Cool and gross, cool and gross. Too late. Check your Twitter. It's ale. What happened with the Baumbauchs? I need it a little bit. Well, I prefer the harder stuff, but I'll take what I can get at this point. Yeah, I'm sticking with this fucking accent for the next two years. (laughter) I'm going to have tons. Well, that was crazy. 12. My god, Ashley's a master fiddler, isn't she? Drums. Thank you. The hype continues. Ashley, I'll do whatever you want, but if you take my weapons I might kill you. Five dragons swoop down. (laughter) Like deputy bouncers? I'll hand her my shortsword, but not my little crossbow. Four. Oh, wait. 12. Well, did you give me dexterity or just stealth? How does that work? We're playing First Edition, right? No, you're not. I'm just a little girl. This is a toy for little children. All right, here. I'm sorry. All right. But what if someone attacks us? All right. This is my first time. (laughter) I mean, she's kind of right. (laughter) Your what? What is that? It's a falchion! For you, Caleb, I do. No, you've been spotting me all day, I'll take care of both of us. That's what we were told is the best seat in the house. I was expecting more Ringling Brothers, actually. (laughter) It's very artistic, yeah. But what does it look like? (laughter) It's too artsy. That bodes well. We're all going to die. I like the tents and donkeys outside. Amazing. Ten. Magic, you're using magic. You said cocked. 4d6, you said. It's a real fight! We've got like a dozen hit points, we'll be okay. Watch out for Fee-ord. (laughter) Okay. Having seen the beautiful dwarven-- girl, was it? Who sang and soothed a monster earlier in the show, I'm going to attempt to sing and soothe this monster. So I step forward and I open my mouth, and I sing, (singing badly) And I will always soothe you! Performance check. Ooh, it's really good. 18, minus three, so that's 15. Does it die? Fuck! (laughter) Yes, I'm going to move, and I'm going to dash behind somebody in the crowd, some weak-looking individual. What are those dice? It's really a hazard. They should have had more exits. 15. You have guns? Taking a shot? But with bullets. This is the bigger monster? All right, Yasha! Is that something you can do right away? That sounds like a later thing. Google reported a weird influx of 'falchion' searches. (laughter) Yasha! Do I have eyes on the biggie? Is Fjord right next to her? All right. I'm going to peek out behind whatever patron I'm next to, take out my little crossbow and just shoot a little shot. 16. It does. This is very bouncy. Okay, so 1d6, that's a four, plus four is eight, plus I get sneak attack damage, 'cause I'm a rogue. Another four, so that's 12. Is the creature bigger than me? I will use Fury of the Small. (cheering) Can I use the rest of my action-movement-whatever bonus to look at the patron I'm next to. Do they have any baubles or jewelry on them? Oh, it's just nine. First blood. She uses a different dice for everything, Travis? Is that what I'm dealing with now? You hate old people so much. This poor guard. Ooh! (groaning) She's definitely sick. What, you're going to kill a guard? Poor guard. Jamieson. Are any of us high charisma? 'Cause it don't seem like it. Oh boy. Temple. (muffled laughter) I am Bo! Nested Nook. Oh, shit. One letter. God damn it. God, you could seduce him. But that's so mysterious. Just say okay and let's leave. No way! What? No! I want to keep playing. (sighs) Everything's better with Molly. (laughter) Look at these cool Wyrmwood cases that we have! Such cool characters, guys! I still don't know what half of you guys are. What's Travis? I don't know nothing, I don't know how to play D&D. Thank you, Matt Mercer, for this amazing new campaign! Welcome to Wildemount. Thanks, Yev.
