Travis, you have something-- yes, right, right there. Yeah, right there. There's a little something. Yup. Have you ever done an episode about Groo the Wanderer? If you do an episode on Groo, that's the one I'll watch. No, no, no. I'll watch it, though. Yeah, yeah. I'm not going to go on your show. I could bring my comic collection on your show! And show it off! Yeah, man! Yeah, I've got some good books, man. Oh yeah, we all made alliances. We all made alliances, Laura. (laughter) That could come in handy. Oh, that's happening, guys. You're going to forget I existed. First roll of the night! One. It's me, Vax. (laughter) Which are 30 feet tall, 20 feet tall? I'm feeling lucky? That's terrible. That's one Luck down. You need a tie breaker? Oh, sorry, nine. Doty! Yes. I'm on that tower. She's on the other tower. What, is that a rule? I'm hiding. The glasses are clutch. (screaming) He sleeps in war paint?! Why would he sleep in war paint?! Oh, man. It's like a cicada. (laughter) Everyone else has gone? I have a lot to do. Number one, how much does Doty weigh? Fuck. That changes things. Still, anything over 400 bones my strategy so it's okay. We're okay. Plan number two. Okay. I say, Doty! I need you to carry me away from all the bad people. Remember how we played keep-away as children? We're playing that now. Keep me away from everybody. Yes. I cast Sanctuary on Doty. I think I can do that. Yeah? Okay. And then for my action I will throw down the Bead of Force on myself and enclose myself in the bubble. I take 5d4 damage. Uh-huh. Not for a minute. I got ten rounds, y'all. See ya! Yes. It says no magic can pass within or without the space, it doesn't say that I can't do magic in the sphere, it just says it can't leave the sphere. Breathable air. Not poison air. I'll roll. Six, seven, eight. Nine points of damage. Sure. Grog's head. Lot of ones. (laughing) It's all threes and fours. There's like six cameras in front of us. Oh, sure. He's holding me in a ball. You'll have to succeed a wisdom saving throw, first. You can still make the attack, you just have to point it at someone else. Well, it'll throw me away. I mean, that's it. DC 17. 14. (Goofy-style screaming) Floating? Is it like at Ren Faire? I'm in one of those balls! Still alive, he's fine. I might be alive for a long time after you're all dead. The inside of the ball is all puke smeared everywhere. Oh, I rolled a 16, plus dexterity of zero. So 16. Sure, sure. End of round one. Okay. Action Prep my healing draught. Just pour it into a bottle and get it ready to rock. Bonus Click my Boots of Speed. Movement (rapid vibration sound effect) With my Boots of Speed on, and the feat that I took, I've got 80 feet of movement. Shh. It's shooting water everywhere, it's spraying it on Keyleth! But I'm also in water, and I don't know if it has any friction or anything. Hey, I moved! I can't communicate with him, I don't think. I don't think sound can escape, so he's going to keep doing what I told him to do. Get to me, and keep me away from other people. It lasts a minute. It doesn't say if he gets hit it ends. Okay, but if he attacks he'll lose it. I'm going to tell him to do that. Get to me and get me away from other people. This is a suicide mission for Doty, guys, this is not going to end well for him. No, it's okay, because hers was an area of effect. Get to me and push me away. Explosions. Oh, no. Eight. Only you can prevent-- There's water right there! Pretty good, this is plus his dex, which is nothing. 18. We have our first victim. No! Does the fire ignite his cannon hand? It's like she was never there. This crazy fireball came out, lit a bear on fire and went back in the room! As my action I tear off my patch of Healing Potions. Now I have four healing potions. (laughter) Don't believe them, Grog, they'll turn on you. Can I take one of them? I will take one. Yeah! Oh, that's cocked. Ooh! Ten points, I am whole again. Great. Oh yeah! I mean sure, when Trinket pushed me do I have momentum that way? Okay, so I'll turn around and I'll go that way. Yeah, that's it. It's like prison. You could do some push-ups. You don't know. Or he's dead. That's not bad. In acid! You're having a weird six seconds of your life right now. But it looks cool. Oh, hi. I'm going to read my Scroll of Fire Shield, setting it to a warm shield that will protect me from all cold damage and last for ten minutes. Oh, but when I get out. Fire Shield. Correct. That's what I want, because I'm already resistant to fire damage. And then I'll roll my ball. I'm just going towards that corner. No, top right. And I'll also pull out my rod and I'll say, crossbow! And I'll load it with a bolt. If that was the real Percy! He likes to hit things. 51. That was 76 points of damage. He's fine! You're all alone. Oh, so he'll just be dead? You're good at jumping over bodies of water. Me? Yep. I'm going to-- crossbow in one hand, I'm going to take my broom and stick it between my legs. Ready to go. I don't know. Matt? And then I will continue my movement. Where am I? Am I that thing in the corner? I'm going to go around the wall so nobody can see me. Right next to the fireball of death, yeah. I'll stay there, and then I'll try something. It's not going to work. I don't think it'll work. Secretly, I'm going to take a patch off my robe, a window patch, and see if I can make a window to climb through the sphere. (laughter) No, I'm trapped in here. Trapped for a minute. They'll let me out when they're ready. I don't think it's going to work. I'm going to hover out a little. I'm not going to leave yet. I'm staying in the safety of the sphere for at least one more round, ready to go. I'm still in the sphere! Yeah, I realize that. Does it do anything to him? Most of your war paint is gone, by the way, Travis. Oh no. Is there an entrance to the tower there? Cat on a hot tin roof. The love of your life. Bathtub buddy. Maybe not. This is the fifth round. Invisibility. And I want to fly out of the sphere and to a vantage point of your choosing, so no one knows where I am, somewhere between 20 and 40 feet high, maybe towards the center-ish of the game field. Up to you where. Yes. No, I don't want to know where I am so you don't know where I am. And Matt. Away from the things that blow up. Was that understood? 27. I honestly have no idea. No, I said, you pick me a place. I don't want to know. Hi. I lose Invisibility if I cast a spell. Or attack something. Does drinking something count as casting a spell? I will drink a Swift-Step Draught, increasing my walking speed now to 60, plus my Boots of Speed, which makes it 120. I'm the fastest motherfucker on the planet. No, I know. Just for future rounds, would dropping a Smoke Stick count as an attack? It doesn't hurt anyone; it just makes some smoke. What about dropping a Tanglefoot Bag? Okay! I just want to know my options here. All right, cool. I think that's it. The speed thing. And oh, can you just tell me, without telling me where I am, do I know the location of Keyleth? Okay. And do I know the location of everybody? Okay. All right, just move me around. You can still touch the building. You're too big for the ceiling. Did you drink the potion that you found? What was it? Oh, cool. What just fell all over the floor? Well, you did everything. I assume, because you know me, Matt, and you're a skilled strategery man, that I am somewhere near Doty? I'll hover near him, over him-- but not right over him, everybody! And just chuck that Smoke Stick right on him. It's only a ten-foot radius. That's it. I don't know, actually. I'm in the air, somewhere within a 30-foot circle of Doty. He's not wasting any actions to put himself out? Oh shit! Does he see an empty ball sitting there? Oh, the Kill Everyone spell? Oh god. No, we got this. We got this. I don't exist. Oh. I thought he was immune, but he's not. Doty's done? Land in the smoke. See that Doty is history. Fire Prismatic Spray at the dragon. Oh, that's not high for me. No, that's terrible for me. Oh. I'm going to use Luck! I'm going to use Luck. One and a two. So when I'm frightened, I just want to get away, right? I was not planning on it, anyway. But it's a spell. d8. Four. They're probably pretty dexterous. Poison! Poison for the win! I don't want to roll 10d6, so I'm going to use one of those websites. Then I have to do all the math. 34. That's not that bad. I'm no longer invisible. But I am in a protecty cloud. I used some movement to land. Do I have any movement left? Then I'd like to go... I'd like to go around to the back of this wall back here. Yeah. And then I'll cast Sanctuary on myself. I'm still in my sphere, everyone. Don't come find me. So the hammer keeps coming back, and he throws it again? Oh, wow. He'll go easy on you. A bunch of smoke. You're trashed. Tary versus a dragon. This is Dragon Slayer. Yeah. I'll be fine. Out of curiosity, where and in what condition is Percival's dead body? Great. Not even when I was in the sky? Okay, then. I might need to use it. Can I poke out this corner? Is it? That's a two again. Where's the door to the thing? It's right there on the front, right? The door to the tower? That's away from the dragon. I'll use my movement to go there. Nope. I poke around the side of the smoke. And a quick little Prismatic Spray. Oh shit. Four again. It's the same. Should we call it the same? MATT and I don't like to roll this many things! 35. Going into the tower. I have a bunch of movement left, right? I'll go into the tower. 120. Ooh, there's floors? I'm going to go into the second floor, that has those little... Yeah. Is there any that can see the dragon, or no? I'll look, get a bead, and then just duck back so no one knows where I am. And also Sanctuary. That's me. That's exactly me. 15! Minus one. Thank you, Critters, for all the cool, useful stuff. What do we have in the store right now, Laura? What do they say on them? I feel like people should go to the store and get stuff now, because when the 100th episode runs around, some of those items might be dropped from the store and replaced with new stuff. I don't know, actually. I literally don't know. So if you want these items, you got to get them now. That's it? Five cards?! It's chaos, and you're not even going to be here to deal with it! I'm in a house with this stuff! It's going to be me! We're never going to get that far. End of game. That's literally what's about to happen. Oh, you're just poor. Does he have 18 hit points now? Oh, you get a cool thing! You get a horse or something. The streak continues with Grog. Where's your skin? (shrieks) No! It bounces off my Sanctuary! Yeah, I did. Never thought it would come to this. I hold up a diamond, and I point it at your face, and I say, I will heal you if you swear you will not stab me in the back. Insight check! That's pretty lousy. 11. Healing draught. 9d8. I can't use my action to pour it down his throat? I will live... to regret this. That's pretty good. I don't know what our plan of action is, so... I can't go up, because I would be scared. Do I have to roll for fear again? I will move down to the bottom floor. I still have some movement, right? I look up to see if I can see the dragon. A wing. I'm going to go to the north bunker. All right. And now I roll my fear? 16? 15. What do I have to roll to beat this thing? Jesus, I'm never going to do it. Oh, okay. Yep. Reckless? You could kill the dragon in one move. Oh shit! Of course you do. So many menu options. For the honor of Strongjaw! He's going to break this plane of existence, too, and come back. The plane of existence. You break it! Why, because I haven't taken a single hit yet? That hits. She's okay. Fly out, fly up. Halfway up. How does a cone work? We're dealing with three dimensions, here. I will aim that way. I have many Prismatic Sprays. It's a 60-feet distance, 60-foot cone. I don't know if the math is going to work. If not, I have a backup plan. d8 again? This is a different one. This is a five. 36, halved. 18. Yeah. I'm flying. That negated my Sanctuary. I'll do one more Sanctuary, and I'm going to stay up. Can I fly back down? That probably took all my speed. Yeah, I'll hover in place. I crack my knuckles. Come on, little man. Let's rumble. I'm flying, so I will fly where I saw him hide. He's immune to everything, right? But he's resistant to everything. I'll fly over there and I guess I've got to get within 30 feet above him. Or 30 feet of him. I'll chuck acid at him. I'll look. Dexterity saving throw. Yeah, so that's halved? It's 9d6. 16. Wow, lousy. It was all ones and twos. Oh, I attacked again, didn't I? Shit. I will do another Sanctuary at level two. (singing) I'm like a bird. Jump and hit or throw and hit? I'm doing that pec thing that you always do, but I can't do it, so it looks like this. (laughter) Sure, yeah. That means it breaks my Sanctuary, yeah. Does he roll again to attack? Oh yeah. Okay. Sorry. I'm going to actually fly away further and pull out another gem from my helmet and cast what modern-day people would call napalm. Straight into the door. A Wall of Fire, straight in the door, in the room. It's 5d8 fire damage. But you're resistant, right? Okay. 26. That's it? Weak. Okay. I'll Sanctuary myself again. Oh yeah. That gets through. Okay. Still kicking. This guy is impossible to kill. Yeah. Is pulling a patch an action? I'll fly right over the acid pit, right over the center, and I've got to do one more Prismatic Spray. It's four. It's poison, right? Wait, a quarter?! Goddamn it! This guy! 42 halved and quartered. So it's 11? Wait, is that right? Ten? Ten?! Oh yeah. That's a good idea! (laughter) 3rd-level Sanctuary. Is the Prismatic Spray a spell? No, but because I used Prismatic Spray. Oh, I see. It's still a low-level spell. I'm just using a slot. Shenanigans. That's my DC. Where are you? But I'm over the acid! Sure. Nope. I live to see another day. Jesus Christ. I know that he takes acid damage, right? Okay, then I will throw acid at him. In the face! Yeah, the acid drop. It's a dex save. 17. This could be it. Oh, this is it. Well, maybe. 29. (screams) He's insane! I'm going to go 50 feet anywhere. To the top of that tower over there, I guess. Yeah. Can I get there? Or as far away from him as I can get. I'm going to get lightninged, but that's okay. I'll take it. (giggles) I casually walk down the stairs. With my hands? All right. I can do that. (laughing) I can't do that. You're so powerful. I'll probably miss! If I miss, then I'm trapped in a room with him! But I could miss. Greatsword! That's what I've got. Greatsword. I'll do this crazy around and around thing and try to do that with the greatsword. Oh, and can I set it on fire, first? What am I rolling? What was that? 12 plus eight plus two magic. That's 22. Three. Oh, it's 2d6. Four. (laughter) What happened?! (screams) I still have movement. I get a disengage. Didn't we go over this? I did a melee weapon attack. Don't I get a disengage for free? Yes! My Mobile feat. Okay. Enough. To hit? Sure. That hurts. It hurts you, because I have a Shield of Fire that burns anybody who attacks me with a melee attack. With 2d8 cold damage. Two. Nine. He gets two rolls. I want him to hit the blazing TD on my chest and have the might of my name ricochet back with the power of energy. The Darrington name strikes him down. I say, Doty, take this down. I win. And I kick him over. Oh, wait. They are? I still had 30 or something. It was like a paintball field. Were all the trunks the same thing? The cards were amazing! You got hammered to death so soon. Oh my god, it's gone. Did you go wash your face? Your sheets tonight are going to be nasty. Well, some of them weren't that good. So really only 60.
