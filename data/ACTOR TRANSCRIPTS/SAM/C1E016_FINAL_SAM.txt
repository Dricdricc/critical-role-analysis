Hi! Can you say all of that again for me? (laughter) Are we in the air? Not much we can do. Oh, do we have one? We have one. She's a mage, right? Ooh. Fancy. Oh, yes! Try to grow a beard. Ugh. He encourages violence. Oh, days have gone by, right? Because you're asleep! Oi? Oh, you know what, Tiberius, I have been giving this a lot of thought and consideration. What's for lunch? Oh. No. No, I was done with the conversation. Well, not the entire body. Yes. All right. This is amazing. Who are you asking? (laughs) I didn't recognize you, Grog. Is that you? Your mathematical skills have been quite impressive. No, no. For a man of such low wisdom, you are proving wiser than I ever imagined. (laughter) Yes. Yes. All right. Hugs, hugs, hugs. (laughter) Now, what does this thing do? All right. Thank you very much. All right, all right. I'm man enough to admit that he's convinced me. Pike. It's like a halo. Like your god has smiled on me, maybe, and said, "He's cool. Go for it." Well. You know, religion is up to interpretation, so I interpret it that way. Thank you, Pike. Sarenrae's my wingman. (sings) I'm dreaming of a white whatever-we-celebrate. Awkward. This is heavy. No, it's fine. It's good to know this. Yes. Yeah, well. Keyleth? Okay. Yes. We have some fancy cloaks, too, don't we? Oh. All right. Pass them out. A fancy. I want a fancy robe. I'll gird it. I'm going to take a large fancy robe and try to tie it up-- to gird it so that it looks okay. I'm going to gird my loins. Also, I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt into the Ioun Stone. (whispers) Pike, are you watching this? I don't know. I'm girded and I've got a shiny head. (laughs) That's a good question. (laughter) High five. Yonn. We are-- I'm Ioun Stone-bearer Scanlan. (laughter) You can call me Kingslayer. I also did that. How far is the Platinum Sanctuary? Oh. Well, unless someone-- Her ex? Arcane-iosity is what he's trying to say. Ix-nay. Are you flying up above? And we're carrying a large ark, or a box of some sort? How big is it? And it's platinum? It's just a platinum box? It's Phoenix something. Nah, I don't know. So, I'm an eagle. Are those the guys who were with us, the envoys? Okay. Hope Keyleth is okay. Great. Oh boy. Keyleth's dead. On a scale from one to five, five being super holy-- Whoa. Do you need a moment? Do you need to sit down? Do you need me to hold you? Message understood. That's those square things. Yonn. Why does he still work here? Does he have tenure or something? Is it a union thing? All right. The Battle Where the Thing Was Lost. Are we to carry the box down as we journey into the dungeons below, or are we to leave it here while we go clear out the basement? Okay. Keep them safe? Oh. All right. We've got enough to worry about keeping ourselves safe. And you know what-- (sings) Primeval Awareness, yeah. (sings) Primeval Awareness, over. Yeah, let's go. Let's just go. Yeah, it's the morning, still. Okay? Let's go. Let's go do it. Oh, here it goes. Here it goes. Haggle with the pope. But think of the good we could do with that money, giving alms to the poor back home where we are. We do a lot of charity work and it would be well-received back home. (under his breath) In our Keep. Deception? A 30. Three-zero! I have a +13 for deception. (laughs) Amen. (laughter) From one holy man to another, I think we've struck a deal. Let's go. Why yes, my sister, lead the way. I don't know how the lord works, it's mysterious. (laughter) I thought he was Vex. Oh, is that you, Grog? Yeah, sure. Let's go. Let's go through. Vorak, Desona, come! He tripped. Whoa! Way to go, Vax. Oh! 13. Ugh. Ow. Are we still moving? The three of us, you're still back. One down! 20 rooms to go. Can we see to the other side of the room? Can we see all the way to the other side of the room? And I'm hoping there's no door. Oh, boy. Ohhh! Ah. He's checking. He's checking. 25. I can inspire her. Ooh, Enhance Ability. That seems like it's aerodynamically-- I'm going to inspire her. With inspiration. I'll sing, (sings) Ooh ooh, shut up and shoot that hole! Your arrow is my destiny, yeah I said, Plus an inspiration. Oh, god. Next room's yours. All right, let's go across and heal our rogue. Me, too. Five. Let's do it. True five. True five. Don't forget to go to Teespring and buy our T-shirts. Six more days. I'm going to tweet the Teespring link right now. (plays note on flute) (laughter) I'm going to go invisible. This is exciting, guys. There's a board of some sort. You have-- you can cast things? Grog, you've got a beard spell. And you have Frenzied Rage. Spikes growth? Really? All right, but can they see the area? No, no! It's fine, just stick to arrows, really. I lost my dice. Every time, every time. I've never rolled a double digit initiative roll, ever. (announcer voice) Wha-Wha-Wheaton. Great. Seven! He's holding a cat. It's Trinket! It's Trinket! He's Dr. Evil. (laughter) What? Ooh. Yeah, man, commit. (singing along with the battle music) It's the music that means we're having a fight. (whistles with the battle music) Cool, bro, let's kill them. Ka-pew! He's fine, he's fine. I'm ready to make my attack turn. I sheath my sword. Eh, you're fine. Suck it up. Use your hit dice, you'll be fine. I'll continue on down the hallway. She had to break it to use Stoneskin. Not good. Nine. (nasal voice) Nine. We already went. Skipping. Oh, we made it. While we're out there, I'm going to check-- I moved in with Grog. I'm going to go invisible. No one's cast Light yet. Why greater? Wait, what? You didn't tell any of us that. Oh, thanks for telling us. No, no, it fell off. Oh. All right, well, I'm going to follow suit and go to the other side and cast Stinking Cloud. No, over-- Over there, yeah. Okay. 15. 17! That's the best stealth I've ever done. 30 feet, I think? I think it's 30 feet. Hold on, hold on, hold on. 90 feet! Oh, that's the range. It's a 20-foot radius. What does that mean? No, no, do it. Stealth! Clang, clang, clang. Cool. Which doors? Ah, we should leave. (whispers) They're going to die. My spell? 17, because I didn't do it through the hand cone. Good story. Wait, can we just leave the thing here with the golem? Oh, then let's go. Kima's dead. Skill challenge. All right, doing good. 19. Oh, no! Against Kima again? Oh, okay. Wisdom check or saving throw? Ten. Ten for me. Nine, wow. Oh, Kima. Kima, for sure. Oh, Grog's got a burnt face. Oh, this guy. Yonn. Circle of death. What? So, when you've fully excavated it, you can come back and check it out. A little web series. Pike, I, Scanlan, will not physically wait for you, but emotionally-- (laughter) But physically, I mean, come on, it's going to be months. Oh, yeah, buy the shirts. Collector's edition.
