He couldn't stand to face Laura. Everybody, our trip to the UK changed us in a lot of ways. We were exposed to the European culture and that area of the world. We fell in love with it. Tonight, there's so much to talk about that I'm going to need some help. Everyone knows Matt's Scottish accent is top notch, but I've been studying with a dialect coach that I found on Craigslist and I think I'm ready to unveil my Scottish brogue. Now, because it's so accurate, Matt's going to translate what I'm saying. I'm going to be saying things in traditional, accurate Scottish about D&D Beyond that he'll translate into American English. Okay, here we go. (exaggerated Scottish accent) Hallo, ya bonnie lassies and laddies! Don't be a wee dafty. Ma kelly ann's been haverin how D&D Beyond is the maest braw app up tae hae though. Nae! I cannae be aff ma heed! It's Taps Aff cos eh D&D and Magic The Gathering, ya numpty! Haud yer wheesht and nick it now or yer fit to be getting skelp, ya herpuin jobbie. (regular voice) Oh, it's my turn! Oh no, that's your line. Wait, that's my line. Okay. (exaggerated Scottish accent) What ya doin the weekend? Jings! You're a right hoodie dobber, ye are, pure walloper--oot yer nut! Ach! Where are Jock Tamson's bairns? It's quality! I'm pure scunnered. (regular voice) I looked these words up! They're real. a.m.! Okay. (exaggerated Scottish accent) Call me doonie, get on yer trolley and heed over to twitch.tv/get-fooked-ya-clatty-radge-wee-shite! (regular voice) I don't know when it stops! Don't press it again; it'll start again! Maybe it's winding down. Ah! Well, you know. We love London, we love UK, we love it all. "To high doh," to high, though. It means something? All these words are real. "Up to high "doh" means a lot? I don't know! Felicia joins us. Should I translate what you just said for our Scottish audience? No. That's the standard? Holy shit, that's good. Nice. This isn't the next few days of our sailing adventure, this is that night? What does it do? I'm drinking. MATT and I don't know where. Are we all staying in the room or do we have a couple of rooms? Let's say that I'm drinking on the deck of the ship. Hi. I've got a good buzz on. Yeah? Hmm. I've kissed a boy. Excuse me? Have you never kissed someone? You're related-- your mom is a master of sexuality-- Because you haven't done it. Oh. Well, what was the situation? Oh, you mean today? Oh! Okay. Well, I mean, let's take a look at this. Your lips pressed against each others'. It meant something. How did it make you feel? Yeah. Alive. That is the feeling. Did it make your heart beat faster than, you know, being completely stopped how it was. If I had to do my first kiss over again, I would want all of those things. Yes! That's the best first kiss. It's someone you care about-- It means something. You'll remember it forever. Oh yes. Well, yes. Afterwards, I don't know if you felt this way, you just can't stop thinking about it and you just feel the soft pressing against you and almost taste him just for a little bit and it doesn't go away for a while. You felt a little-- Ooh! It wasn't as romantic. It was just a dare. Yes. I don't know. Just someone. I don't even remember too much. I sure did. It was just-- you know? I was pretty young and kids just saying like, "Oh, you "kiss each other and you kiss each other now." Just one of those types of games. I think so too, but I don't remember his name. I do. Yes. It was a good day. Well, do you think things will change now between you? Are you interested? Well. Sometimes, boys like-- Why am I telling you all this? Your mom's a lady of the night! Sometimes boys like it if you are a little bit aloof. A little bit cold to them afterwards like maybe they did something wrong and they don't even know what it was. Yes! Yes! Just a little bit of like-- just keep them guessing like "Did I say something? Did I do "something? Was I a bad kisser?" That would put him on the defensive where you want him. Then you cut his throat and fucking kill him! I'm just kidding about all that. I don't know. No! Of course not! He's our friend. All right, I will. Have fun drawing. We should solve this at some point, right? We should get some bean bags or something? An hour?! Is food and water the only thing we need? Do we need any other supplies to make this trip? I don't know. Powder monkey? Maybe I'll apprentice as that first? Manager of the ship. Like the office manager, right? Keeps it running? He said quartermaster, not boatswain. You're strong. Do you have any-- Hey, you've been around barrels your whole life! I'm the gunner! Well, the powder monkey. For now. Working my way up. We have some, though. They're torturing orphans on the deck. (shouting) All right you motherfuckers! I need hollow charges loaded! I need extra fuses on every motherfucking cannon! Get me hollow shells loaded with extra charges. I want four cannonballs on every cannon! Move! (shouting) Yeah! (shouting) Light them up! Load them up! Put the charges at the ready! (shouting) Short fuses! (shouting) If you're not going to help stand out of my way! The Academy? Oh. Oh, I see. So a warning shot's okay? To me it seems like the closer the more intimidating. Right? So "don't fire at them?" All right. (shouting) Come on you, motherfuckers! Get ready to fire! To fire? All right. I'm so excited. I'm just going to take a swig. Are you with us? Okay I'll cast a quick Message and say Fjord I'm about to fire my warning shot. Good to go? You can respond to this message. All right. I will light the fuse? I don't know how you do it. Okay. Do I have to roll for this? Okay, that's a natural one. Ready! Aim! Fire! What happened? What's going on? I put the fuse in first and then I put the powder in and then one of the balls? Is that right? Maybe I did them-- I think I did the ball first and then the powder. Shit! Let's go to another cannon! Uh-huh. It's not wood, but sure. Sorry! Technical difficulties. I was born to do this. I've got this. Are they getting away? Okay, that's better. Intelligence check, 20. Couldn't be more different. Hey, back off old man. I cast Message. Fjord, mission accomplished. Board at will! You can respond to this message. Oh boy. You guys, if you live in the UK, you're going to get some faster, cheaper shipping. Of the art book. Which going to be available what day? This is exciting, but also D&D Beyond. You made those? Does this ship have a grid printed on it or carved into it? (cooing) Yasha! I'm going to cast Message. Fjord, we are reloaded and ready to fire. If you want me to fire, literally reply with any word. You can reply to this message. Fuck. (laughter) From the other crew? I say that all the time to my lady friends, by the way. That sounds awful. A treat. This poor guy! Oh! Does she get advantage on barrels because she's a cooper? Frumpkin can attack? Hold! What? What is it? Stand down, men. Are there any men standing near me? Stand down. At ease. Wait for my signal. Where are we going? What's going on? Oh my gosh. Is Fjord dead? Okay, let's go. Ah! What is this? What am I doing? What do you want me to do? Me?! Oh, Jesus. What if it blows up? I don't want to blow up our ship. I already did that once today. All right. Step back. Are there any alcoves or closets or chests around here or anything? Okay, I'll open a crate and put it inside and then move back and use Mage Hand to try to open it or check for traps with it. Oh. Well then I will check for traps first. That is a 20! Mechanical or magical? Can I attempt to disarm it with Mage Hand? Okay, so back up, everyone. Cover your eyes. Cover your ears. 28. One in the pooper! (laughter) I think it worked. Oh, it's still locked. With thieves' tools? 27. Wow. I want to go look. A foot-long paintbrush and a little pot of paint. We're not going to touch this. We're going to take these to our friends who know what to do with it. You were paid to carry this around? Do you think it was a prank? Were you pranked by a friend of yours or something? Boysie. I'm hiding the little pot-thing, by the way. Yeah, that's true. (stilted) I have to go check on the cannons downstairs. I'll be back later. Minus three. Ten. Of course, Captain. I am at your beck-and-call. Bribing the crew in front of the captain. Clang, clang-clang. (running feet pattering) I'm going downstairs. Where are we? Let's get into our rooms. We're going to go into our cabins. The captain can be invisible. She might be in this room with us right now. Just do this. Do we feel anything? Here's what I got! It's a magical paintbrush! Identify it. Not yet. Is it a big box? But it's the size of the item contained within. It's not giant or anything. Long spell. What do you think it-- Oh, a tattoo, if we could pick any tattoo? You mean, what physical attribute would we increase, or what would you want the tattoo to be a picture of? Yeah, can he do more than one Identify at a time? Oh. You mean, the shield? Any news, Caleb? Anything? Wait. When you walk down an alley and paint dicks-- SAM and Just dicks everywhere, dicks and dicks! Just a wall full of dicks! If someone falls asleep, you could paint a dick on their head, and they'll have a dick on their head! (yelling) Can it make living things? Not living things. If we wanted to spirit ourselves away from this boat in the middle of the night, she could paint us a boat. Oh. Paper? Not a ship, I'm talking about a raft, she could just paint a little raft and we could (boop). We're here. Oh, Fjord. Or one pretty nice-size apartment. Quick, Caleb, Identify this in ten minutes. I give you the shield to Identify. What can your imagination make? Keys. Ladders. Clothes? Catwoman outfits. A shield that can fight? That's so cool. Who can use a shield? Do we have any shields? Caduceus? Can I use a shield? No. Oh! Light armor. What do we do now, Fjord? Nothing. It's a floating dick-making paint. Don't waste any paint, but yes! A flaccid penis, or an erect penis? That's right. I was born to be a cannoneer. No, she had one, but she got rid of it. Fjord has one. So it would good for us to get that last one so that she can't. Then we would have failed. She would want the third. Which means she would want Fjord's body. Look at the port window! Is there a port window? But the overall mission is to get-- Don't say anything? We've been feeling around the air. Some people give up information when they've been seduced as well. Is that something you could do? I noticed that as well. No, I think she's right. Ooh! (laughter) She lived in a brothel. Do what you need to do to get all the information out of her that you can. If we see you cozying up with her, we'll know. We'll know that it's just an act. Let's just do our jobs. I've got a cannon to fix. Six, seven feet. You can create water? When did that happen? (whispering) The rest of your brethren? Why would there be one there? That's where we're going, yeah. What is this triangle of? Where the three objects are, or where the three temples are? Matt? Before you go on, can I just real quickly steal a bunch of gunpowder, while I was learning how to be a powder monkey? I'm talking like a pinch here. Yeah, little pinches at a time. I don't want tons, I'm not trying to steal a barrel, just enough to make one of those bangy arrows again, just enough for the tip of an arrow. That's a natural one. I'm going to be trying to construct a explosive arrowhead at some point. What am I doing? Tinker's? What is it, dex? 15. 19. The Revelry? Darktow! Are we off the ships yet? Dead man walking. I'm going to get on my hands and knees and kiss the ground. I love it. (nervous voice) Hi Marius. Yeah, that's good. We hired them for a certain amount of time. After it's repaired. Who, who are you? What is your name? James Tybalt. Assistant to the Plank King. Do we need to bring any presents or anything to the Plank King when we meet him? Yes, sir! That's for her to do. Balls. I hear rain. It was just a dude! All hail the king. Oh, yes. We are part of Avantika's crew, but humble servants in her adventurous adventures. I am-- some call me Gilligan, others other names. I present to you this dried meat of the harpy as a present for you. Harpy jerky. So much! I just love water so much! (laughter) Yeah. May I just ask, this Linus person over there, are they just writing everything down that we say? I guess so, we're going to go just enjoy your fine place now, thank you for having us. She's a snitch. It's awesome, yeah. Hear hear, let's go. How did this happen? I will say this, though In comparison to these folks, we're not so bad. We're not that bad.
