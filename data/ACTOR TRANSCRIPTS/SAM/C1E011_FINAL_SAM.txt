I hope you guys got my word that you did not try to capture him, did you? No, don't try to-- No, don't capture him, that's a terrible idea! Sorry. He's moving? Bigby's Hand. Grab him. Grapple him. Yeah, I can grapple a massive beast. It just says "Big." No. It can grapple a Huge or smaller creature. I'm here! Plus what? I got it right here. Concentration--- No, AC. The hand has an AC of--- No, here it is. 18. Yes! I do that with people. Okay, got it. That's not very much, nine points total. (shaky flute music) (shaky flute music) Get used to that sound. Math is happening here. Action Math! That's some hot math. You're grappled. Oh, me? I get to do more? But he's a giant, and I'm a little thing. I guess I should hit him. I'm going to hit him with a Lightning Bolt. I should come in close? Oh. But he's big, and I'm little! Yes, thinking it at me. I'll just make-- Does Lightning Bolt come from me, or can-- Well then, I have to move anyway, so that I don't strike Vax or Vex. Well, will I hit either of my fellows from where I'm-- Yeah, then I need to move. That ring, is that high? Low? Oh gosh. I don't really jump well. All right, I'm going to jump into the ring, I guess. And then can I shoot from there or will the wall be in my way? Okay. Oh, he'll hit me. Oh yeah. (high-pitched) Ah! Does a 20-- Is that good? Okay, I will cast Lightning Bolt on his face and neck area. 8d6, give me those sixes. I need all of them. Ooh, a lot of sixes. Six, six, six. 31. Do I get my bonus? Can I give Inspiration to mister Vax over there? (bad flute playing) (slightly less bad flute playing) Can he move? 18 plus eight. (cheering) Except for me. Ooh! (laughter) I'm a little dainty gnome! (laughter) Right, good, thank god. Don't kill the giant! Don't kill him. Don't kill him, we need him. We have a mind flayer, we have magicians, we have all sorts of things. He is our wrecking ball. He's our way in. Yeah, yeah. He is our ticket into the palace. One! Many have before. We're capturing the giant, and don't remind him I'm here. That's what it says in the book. What's the spell name? ORION AND Oh. A Lariat of Truth? Double grapple! She's getting closer to me. You're going to talk? You're just appealing to his reason? Twice. Don't fall on me! Where's my dice? Where's my 20? Oh, here it is. Plus what? 17. Do we get free attacks on him? (laughter) I'll take it. That's a plus, that's a positive. We are grappling the hell out of him. Grog, you might have to talk to him again. Just hold him. How did you do it? You had another one? (whispers) Okay, he's asleep. Okay, we have a mind flayer. Yeah, Clarota is a mind flayer, it's his bag. Until it resists, that's no good. We need to rest. And it lasts for 30 days. Put him in the Bag of Holding! Don't worry about his dinner right now. Let's figure out how we're going to control it. Okay, let's manacle it. Let's at least try to hold it. Chain it up. No, they're inorganic. I can't do anything to those. I have poison. I have drow poison from a previous adventure. That's a knockout drug, isn't it? Damn it! 20. You don't have the spell, right? With our puny chains. We also have our never-ending rope, don't we? Sure, yeah, why not? She's just casting, right? I'm going to inspire her, somehow. I'm going to inspire her with a song. Spellcasting DC. What's your DC? What's he saying? Oh, it's not Giant. She's the one. The accent is on the 'kh'. Is it like a French person? (French accent) I don't know what you're saying. Oh, 'unh'! Oh, I understand now. Where. He's asking where. We should tell him. She's going to translate. Go ahead and translate that. I speak Keyleth. (laughter) We did, he didn't give it. Tiny, that's clever. You found booty? Beautiful things should go to Pike, I think. I just feel that the gold of the javelin would match the gold of your heart. Sounds a little "read"-y. Bolt of lightning, five feet wide. Basically, it's just lightning. But in a javelin. Fomorian? Just before we rest, does anyone have knowledge of his race and his species? Any of his weaknesses or strengths? Can I do a history check? That's a one. Nature check. Just to see, what are his strengths and weakness? What about his race? FOH-MOH-ree-ans. It doesn't have to do it with all its heart. Do we know what sorts of things he either hates or likes? That's pretty good, too. I'll sleep near you, Kima. Suit yourself. Well, let's rest. In shifts. No. We don't want to seem aggressive towards him. That's a good question. We're not going to mount our full attack, are we? We could. Until when? You want it out of the temple. Or giant that metal. Well, not everything. I can get the giant inside the temple. It will never work. It'll never work! How would you get the stone cold enough? You would need all sorts of sides to add to it, to fold into it. It's a terrible idea. All right. How far is the forest, before the city? That plan is growing on me. Let's take a rest. Tomorrow we can stealth in and get some intel. A suicide mission? He was born for this. We should do some recon. There might be beings or creatures around there that we can distract, use to our advantage, something. All right, but we don't know how we're going to break that thing. We don't have acid. How much? We do have that yellow vial. We don't know. It could make it stronger. I have a dagger that I never use. Great. Rusty instruments? I use my Minor Illusion to create a (failure horn sound). (laughter) Oh, Pike. Chatroom, please help out Ashley. Good, that's good. Good on metal. How about a giant? Dropped him. I think what Vax is proposing is to create a diversion down there while we work on the metal. Try to weaken it. Great, let's hear it. Your name is confusing to us. This is why we wanted to call you Clarence. Sorry, sorry. Seems too complicated. Complicated engineering. And it's made of metal and glass? So if it falls, it would be bad on the brain. Yeah, we should go have a look tomorrow morning. Why? Because-- No, we're not going to get caught. Yeah, we should go. We should know all we can know. Oh shit! Oh God, that's our giant. We will fill that cask with ale. This is a promise cask. All right, shall some of us stealth ahead to the temple to see what we can see or should we set out on foot as well? Yeah, it's just a foot. Don't go crazy with it, Pike. Yes, what is the plan? Are some of us setting out on foot or are we just sending-- On foot. On the carpet, okay. Just recon. All right, I'm with you. What does it do? It's just us two? Farewell, Pike. I'll miss you. What? My love? All right, off we go. (sings) I can show you the world. I leave it to you. 18. Many figures. We need that big brain on our side? Unless we all go in from the top. What will we be doing in the meantime? We Rage. (laughter) Evacuate it via air. May I throw a wrinkle into things? Those bats didn't look good. Those are eyes that he's using to watch things above. So we gotta get through the bats first. Or distract the bats, or get rid of the bats. No no no. The bats will ruin our element of surprise. We don't even know what we're doing. So that's either a distraction or taking care of bats. Yeah, but if we float, then we're going to float right through the fog. Grog had Annette, back in Emon. She was great. We have camouflage? No no. He'll need a door to let in other people. Yeah, we are. Can we-- Before we make this journey, can we sound off who's on what duty? Who's on damaging-the-device duty, who's on-- Who's on the shutting-off-those-doors duty? Is that a thing that we need to assign to someone? That could be you, but you're not going to be there. You'll still stay behind? I will inspire him. (sings) Everything is awesome! SAM AND And when he attacks us, what do we do? We're effed. Just to clarify. Before we go. I am dropping a giant mouse in there, right? LAURA AND Okay. Come on, let's go have some fun! Good pep talk. Ooh. Oh, Kima. Clarota, are you going to put your-- We're a well-oiled machine. How are we getting there? (groans) It's also an easy way out. I have one more plan, just to throw it out there. Just occurred to me. It just occurred to me. It could get us into the temple a different way, but not into the chamber. I could make us all look like illithids. He could read our minds but we'll be outside. Typically, it's "Yes, and," Clarota, but all right. (laughter) What are we telling the-- Hey, hey! What are we telling the giant to do? Knock the cross or attack K'Varn? I make him a mouse. (laughter) All right, let's go. How does Grog get anywhere? I forget. Us too. Is Trinket worth it? (laughter) There's just a limited number of spells. Of course Trinket is worth it. I was saying-- I was being Bizarro Scanlan. Don't take offense, but we can leave Kima. She can't do anything for us up here. She has no ranged attacks, she's useless. In a sexy way. We're still doing shifts then. It's the same issue. To fly a mile? Wait, what did you do? You're staying? Oh, what are Kima and Clarota-- I'm going to, in front of us, using Minor Illusion, I'm just going to create a floating bald eagle thing to distract the bats with. It's just flying around. Stealth isn't dexterity, is it? 23. The bats. Wait, when we've arrived, is anyone going back? No. Who's going back? And you're going back to pick up the others? I'm flying! "I'm flying!" Bats. Persuade those bats. I'm not with her. I don't even know this is going on. It could be anything. Before he does, can I-- I'm going to just see if there's any magic protecting these-- the metal or the joints. 23. Yeah, of course. Is there any purchase? Like, can a hand grip the metal pole? You're not with us. You stayed on the carpet. And do what? Loud. We can fly up and just drop him down like a big, giant bomb. We can take him up up up, and just drop him. How much does he weigh? A ton? That'll break it. (laughs). Let's drop a-- Let's drop a giant bomb on him. I don't-- I think dropping three tons on him is going have much more-- All right, who's flying the mouse up? I'm Polymorphing him. I'll make him drop. Come on, let's do this. On the carpet. Go. Do. We die with honor. Cages of bad guys. I think Matt had things printed in a 3D printer for this, so it's pretty, pretty cool. I won't let you die, Pike. That's a crazy roof party. Okay, drop it, drop it like it's hot. I'll cast Inspiration on this gentleman for his throw. Oh. Pike. Grog. Percy. You get Inspiration. And Vax. (sings) And so I come to you with Inspiration. Vex or Vax? When he falls. (yelps) Un-Polymorph! It's a falling giant. The German judge doesn't like it. But because he is enchanted he can still attack, right? Not me, you don't pick me up. (laughs) Two. Question, sorry. What happened to the big mind-control device? Is that disabled? So the mind flayers, as far as we know, might not even be under-- Okay. We might have to get Grog out of there somehow. We need to run. You have Inspiration. Should you need it. Thanks for the clarification. Guys, come on. This is like, piece of cake, there's one guy. There's like eight of us. Yeah, don't fall. Yeah, I think that's fair. Okay, let's leave Keyleth here and just go. Yeah, just go. She's grappling. You're the worst. Oh boy. Our healer is about to die. Boy oh boy. You say you can take a hit? Okay. Chain Lightning scroll. It's the biggest thing I have. It's a scroll of Chain Lightning. I can't cast it at my level so it's gonna be just a 50-50 shot whether it even works. Ability modifier. Ten plus five. Seven, eight, nine-- I need one more. Okay (nervous laugh) someone do math. 15, 20, 21, 25, 30, (clears throat), 44. I can choose the other, the other guys in the cage? In the cages? Yeah! Then yeah, yeah, that! I have a bonus action. There's nothing-- Oh, and a move. I think I'll stick, but as a bonus-- shoot, I've used all my Inspiration already, right? I can't do cantrips as a bonus, right? Okay. Then never mind. (Grog voice) I would like to run. That was your stealth. With advantage. 18. Because she cast enhance dexterity. Thank you, Keyleth. Whew! Grog, you okay? Strength? May I use my Cutting Words? It's not an attack, okay. Then a strength saving throw. Oh, With advantage. Oh good. Ee. Not good. Ten. Oh, into the room? But I don't want to be in there. 17, no 19. No problem. Easy, easy Thank you, Pike. I stand, I look at the creature. No, I don't look at the creature. (laughs) I just sort of look near the creature, and I will punch it in its face with Bigby's Hand. Hand is an object that has an AC of 20. Strength of 26. Blah blah blah. It's the Clenched Fist. It's a melee attack, it's like-- d20. Ten. (laughs) Right? Yeah. I'm not very strong. Damn! All right. Are you still hurting, Grog? As my bonus action, I'm going to give Grog some more healing. Yeah. (sings) So I come to you, with Healing Words. Now you know what to grow. I don't know. Healing Words! All right, so that's 1d4 plus five. It's not very much. Do I roll for that or does he? Ugh, six. I rolled. You get six. Sure. You have Inspiration. You stumped him. That was great. That's a strong five. Death Ward. Oh my god. Is this an automatic hit? Dexterity. That's your good die. Come on, Matt, can't you remember where ten people are at once? She's such a racist. (laughs) It's something. Now you have 3 hit points. Come on, Grog. Don't die. Again. (high-pitched) Yeah, yeah. It seemed totally reasonable. Ah! Hey! Oh, hi guys. Do I blind it or do I attack it? Is he looking at me? I'm going to blind his big eye. With Blindness. Oh, he can see me? I'm in his field of vision? Oh, then never mind. Okay, I'll move out of the cone. And now I try to blind him. Wait, I-- Through the Hand Cone of Clarity, of course. (sings) Blinded by the light. 19. Fuck you. Great. Well then, as my bonus action, I'll give Grog just a little bit more healing. Six more. She's in human form, by the way. (laughs) It's just how she talks. That's great. From the fall? Run. Away. You can heal yourself. He's almost dead until he kills. Are you still running for Congress out there? (gasps) Oh no, Kima's stoned. Kima's stoned. That's a lot. Oh look, there's a man with a gun on a flying carpet, coming in. Whoa. Oh! Lightning Bolt on the thing with the bad guy. Lightning. Lightning. That's all I know. And hell, I'll do it at a higher level. Level three. No, it's level two for me. No, I'm sorry, level four. Level four. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Okay, so it's half this? Ah! Lost one. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. 18. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23-- 25, so 12. I give some healing to Pike, as well. (sings) Hey! Hey baby, hey baby, hey. (sings) Hey baby, hey baby, hey. It's not much. Oh, it's eight. I counted wrong. Come on, you've been working out. Hey, that's good. We're killing him again. But then-- Two of ten times. Don't touch it to him. I know. But don't touch it to the thing. For the moment? Wow. Is that true? Sure. We should. You're going to have an alien axe? Hey. Hey I'm Roy Mustang. They're getting married next week. You're just a Negative Nancy.
