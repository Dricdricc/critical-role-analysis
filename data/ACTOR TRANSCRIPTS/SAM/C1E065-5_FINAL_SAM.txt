Hi, guys. Lootcrate, Lootcrate, Lootcrate? You did it already? We're cutting to a video? Yeah, we'll be at SacAnime-- I... nope? (laughter) My mouth is full! Also orc. (laughter) Yeah, what's your intelligence? Yes, and I am Obby the Rat. I am a dwarf. I am a rogue. That's it. Roll for initiative. (laughter) I'm nervous for Liam because he has to be under a lot of pressure right now. (exaggerated Russian accent) Obby the Rat has question. (laughter) Obby has big head. I follow my nose. MARY, LIAM and And we pick one or the other? Yes, I'd follow you anywhere, Tarvis. He's very smart. Obby prefers the feet. Tarvis. Even though this Dren is guarding our prisoner, we are all allowed to kill her if she acts up, correct? I will go first. Yes. Let me tell you story-- you know why they call me Obby the Rat? Because I am small. Like rat. I go first. I will climb up there. Will it be an easy climb or difficult climb? (laughter) Obby the Rat is now realizing he must maintain accent for three hours. (laughter) Hold my torch. Acrobatics. Ooh! 22. I look back down at them. (clicks tongue) Natural 20. Whoa! Not great. I stick my head out of the pipe, and say, I think it found where it splits into two. I'm covered in mostly number ones, a few number twos. We can make it through here, it will be very difficult, though. Where are you all? What? I can come down from the number one and number two place? All right, Tarvis. I jump down. It's okay, I am frequently used as punishment. 16. I'll be number two. All. As much as I don't want to rely on our prisoner, this would be a good opportunity to throw a light down the hallway. Obby says do magic trick. Thank you. It's a 7/5/7 meter poem. Not where I'm from. You wrote that? Ahead of time? Four. We hold Devan above us as a human shield and keep running. That's pretty smart. We could all go, leaving Tarvis here. Obby the Rat runs. Forward. This will not work. I run. Who, me, or them? Me too? 25. Yes. Is the acid still going? I'm sorry, I panicked. You know why they call me Obby the Rat? Rats survive. We'll never know. Obby will oblige. I will do a perception check to see if I see any more tiles. Five. I cut my hand. I cut my hand and put it there. I have a vast lineage. Does it work? No. I will try. I'm squeezing the number one out of my moustache. What did you do? Was it a boy? Oh, that got someone else killed. I'm going to look for exits and entrances to the room. There's another? Not the one we came in. I found a piece of paper with codes on it, like Maverick, Goose, Hollywood. I can't make it out. Obby the Rat can break any lock. I will check the doorknob. Yeah. Two. We're good. I open the door. We had nowhere else to go. Not related. That one I know particularly. Or a cat? LAURA and Wait. This is the only door in? Okay, I go to them and say do not touch that gold. No, I'm going to check it for traps. What am I doing, perception? Ten. Okay, Dren, you can stick your hand in and get-- A dragon appears. Oh boy. Liam, it's not in 3D, it's not color-coded. There's no atmospheric mist, come on, man. 22. I stealthily flank it using Devan as a distraction and I will sneak attack it with a dagger. Wait, which one is it? Yeah, I'll go straight from where I am. Yeah, from the side. Nope. 11. With my bonus action, I still have some movement, right? I will disengage and hop over that chest so I'm more behind it. Right there. Aptly named spell. Guys, we're playing Dungeons & Dragons just like on Stranger Things! Hey Liam! Those are no longer mint in box. Okay, I will attack the first one with a dagger again, hoping to hit it this time. Nope. 13? Oh, okay, so eight, plus sneak attack damage, right? Ten. No problem, don't need it. I'm going to try to move. Well no, first I'll use my bonus action. The feature that only I can do is sleight of hand on my bonus action. It says that I can try to open a trap or a lock. I'm going to try to pry open its mouth. The one that is holding Devan. It's a trap or a lock, maybe? I have a crowbar, so I'm going to jam it in and try to pop it open. Just enough for her hand to get out. 15. No problem. Two hours. It's okay, Obby the Rat can take them both by myself, apparently. I want to go to him. All right, Obby focuses still on big one. Is Travis within five feet of him? I mean Tarvis. Natural one. That's no good, sorry! And then I will use my bonus and move to disengage and move so I'm on the other side of the big one, hopefully out of range of the little one. (singing) Quicker than a Ray of Frost. You can dash, right? Obby the Rat would like to move in and attack, so I will take a couple steps towards him, and I get a 14. Seven, it's not a sneak attack right? Travis is out of the way? Seven points. Dagger. I will bonus action try to pull the dagger out with sleight of hand. Not good. Slightly better. Ten. Oh, he cares? Do we know what that is? We are here to get a large jewel. Not gold. There's no other doors, right? Yes, sir. I retrieve my disgusting daggers from the beast. And I poke little holes all over. What are you wearing? And it all has little holes in it. So what's next? What room is that? I come into the room and see the dog beds, and I stop at the door. Do you know why they call me Obby the Rat? I hate dogs. Obby would rather not, but I will for you. I owe you for spilling acid. Hey, do you need some health, or something? You're bleeding from your eyes. I will go and inspect the dog beds, is that what I've been commissioned to do? I don't need her. What am I doing? I'm checking the dog beds for traps. Five. And I will sniff around and see if I can smell any animals. Ten. Time is of the essence, we should move. She gave you judgy face. Gladly. Vodka. Not interested. It's made out of solid brass. Was it always there? Woodchuck. Gray squirrel. Where is it? I will take the rear. I do not like dogs. Two. Seven. Is that dog? Outside? Behind the painting? (groans) I hate art. I look behind the painting. There's a man looking through the eyeholes of the painting. No, he seemed okay. Come on, off the top of your head! Quick! Quick! Devan? Family is very important. You should not have stolen from yours. If you want attention there's other ways of finding it. You're the boss, boss. Me and Dren are going to the library. Yes. I'll do a perception check to see if there is anything out of the ordinary or weird? 18. I pick it up. I give it to Dren. And I say maybe you can use this, not for me. Sex-a-holic. Audience, she said that she's going to do whatever she can to help you. We rejoin the group. Well there was-- There was a ladder on wheels that could be the source of farcical comedy and hijinks. But not tonight. How about a natural 20? It's got to be the double doors, right? It's an old Backstreet Boys poster. Dogs? What dogs? I pick up two playing cards, one with Corey Feldman and one with Corey Haim. There's stairs going up. We're going into this magic room, is that right? Shield? Were the shields traps or something? Okay, what is it? I will do it. Will I die? I lift it up. Okay. Now what? I do. Up down up down? Sure, I pull it down. Well this is just great, I'm glad we brought you here as our guide. All right. We should kill her. She's useless to us. We've got to keep her hand with us. How did you do that? How big? Well I like this art better. Yes. Felt a click. We're supposed to push up the shield and then tilt back a wall sconce or something? Pull out a wall sconce? We can go look. Where was the wall sconce? I feel right where she's pointing. I'm going to check the shield to see if I can intuit how it works. Four! Should we start opening things and-- Well something needs to happen or we leave this room. I can jump on things and unlock things. We're avoiding the carpet altogether. Tarvis has told me to pick up the wasp. Natural 20. What kind? No, I am a dwarf, advantage on saves versus poison, resistance against poison damage. I suck the poison out. I swallow it down. 17. Where did she go? Feel the floor around where she was standing. Wait, what are the objects around us that we can see immediately around us? One of the paintings was water? I go to the water painting and start feeling it. I'm looking at the painting to see if there's anything. 12. Don't worry, Obby the Rat knows what to do. What is this? 13. I know what it says. I reach my arm into it. All the traps have been sprung. Tarvis. We can let Devan die. Eight. You are dead. You're a dead person. Draw a fish tank. With what verbal command? Did we all run down to the thing? I was futzing with the art. I'll use my movement to run into the room. Can I get there? I'm in the room? Then I say why is everyone in here? Oh! No, drowny girl. She dead. Disengage. Why did we come in this room again? No, I mean the magic room. Why are we here? There's no big jewel here. We're here for jewel. Now would be a good time for a haiku. So inspiring. Hey! Sounds like a pretty special woman. I think you should be grateful to have a grandmother like her. Family is very important. The circle in the middle of the room is a foot and a half wide? How big was the brass column? I'm going to go take a look at that without standing on top of it or touching the flowery stuff. 14. Not too great. Oh boy. (laughter) There's something with this circle. Something's under it. I don't know what, though. Well if it's a monster, that would be bad. Is that your grandmother? Oh boy. Obby rolls ten. (snickers) Dogs all rolled 20s. Who, who's that, who's biting? 16. Minor Illusion? Savage attack? Is it near a thing, do you get a sneaky, sneaky? You get a sneaky? They're all dogs. Trusty d12. I attack the big dog with a dagger. I get him. It's a 22. Three. Eight. Plus nine. 17. I say to it, do you know why they call me Obby the Rat? Because Obby is actually short for Obenthal. It's a nickname. And then I'm using my bonus action. I will use sleight of hand to jam my fucking crowbar, that I recovered from the dude, into the floor to try to open the circle on the floor. 20. No, it was a 13 plus a seven. It's Sylvia Plath. About Sylvia Plath? What did she ever do to you? Better than 16? Yes. Lucky. Obby the Rat. I do not like dogs or number ones. What are you casting? You can also aim it straight up in the air. The door is for more monsters to come out. Wait, is the White Fang gone? Obby the Rat would like to kill the dog in front of me. The one on the sigil. Natural 20. (cheering) Wait, is there sneak attack? So just seven, wait-- Ooh, another six. So wait, so five and five plus two? Each time plus two? 14. Handaxe. I will try one more time to open door on floor. Okay, I will not do that. Instead, I will say, Tarvis, do you need potion? And I'll disengage and back away from the dog then. Yeah, as far as I can. Unless you disengage. Pronounced Obby. Short for Obenthal. Thank you, Dren. Death saving throw. Mostly skull at this point. Pop that potion. We all missed her, really. Has Dren killed everyone tonight? Obby the Rat moves to center of room, says thank you to Dren for killing all dogs. I give haiku to Dren. I say I'm Obby the Rat, you know why they call me that? 'Cause I hate haiku. Shit. Okay, I look down. I look down real quick. Do I see any imperfections, anything in the floor, anything that I can--? In that case, I look straight up and I throw a dagger. 17 plus seven. 24. Eight. Not the worst thing that's been on my face today. Wisdom, not my strength. Five. Is his spell on me concentration? Hits you in the face. Nathan Beholderman. Plus five on the dagger. Yellow and purple. Tarvis, what did they do to you? You are brave and wise leader. I start cutting him out. 20 more beholders. Which one is the real one? Ask a question that only it would know the answer to. Can you read? Must be some sort of trap that the grandma left. I grab the iron thing with the eye. What does that do? You want the one on the right? I will throw a dagger at the other one. I'm not doing anything, I'm looking at the medallion. Wait, it's a d2, don't you have a d2? Do the percentage die, we never get to use those! Finally. Tarvis is pretty dumb. 24. I would like to attack one of the to be determined duplicates. 16. Seven. Seven damage. Sleight of hand. But you're one of us, you're one of the Clasp. Roll that d20. Can you Misty? She's my family. Holy shit! 6d10?! Is it for what color it is? I was first. He can't see any of them. Six or higher. Obby the Rat takes no joy in this-- I take no joy in attacking you, but it is my duty, I'm sorry. 20. I throw dagger. So I hit the mirror image, even though I saw her shoot rainbows out of her hands? All right, fine. Colors I don't like. Oh, and I used some movement to go a little bit closer to her. Yeah. Are we here for the ledger, Tarvis, or the jewel? Dren, you are one of us, why are you doing this? What are you talking about, she's a gir-- ooh. Dren, she has betrayed her own family, don't you think she will betray you too over gambling debts? I live with my wife, her mother, her mother, and her mother, and I hate them all, but we all get along because we are family. She will lie and stab you in the back. By the way, Tarvis, you're talking to the wall right now. (laughter) We've got a little Mexican standoff here. (laughter) Obby! Obby the Rat! I can open any door, I can open that door if that's what you want open, but we need that jewel. Both? Hey, stop trying to pry open the hatch! (laughter) Tarvis, I follow orders. You tell me what to do. Not good. Seven. Wait. Why are we seated at these tables? (laughter) The 'D' one. All right. I attack Dren. I do not like haiku. You know why they call me Obby the Rat? I can sniff out a traitor. I failed! Three! Seven? I don't know. Do you have an AC of ten? Bonus action, I disengage and run back. It can't move. The Minor Illusion, I don't think it moves. Shouldn't have given us so many potions. If you attack with a weapon. I run over to Devan. I stab her in belly with dagger. I roll four. (laughter) Wait, with bonus action, sleight of hand, I attempt to remove her pouch with healing potions. I roll five. (laughter) Hey! That's some real damage. Aren't you attacking with the rapier? Tarvis. Devan or Dren? Obby follows orders. I roll a two. It just hits? So what do I roll? Is she dead? Holy shit. That was so mean of me. I use sleight of hand to try and steal her jewel from her. Well then I take the healing potions. 19. Oh man, poor Laura Bailey. You're right. Obby has no feelings. I turn to Dren and say, where is the jewel? Tell me or I kill your friend right now. Okay. I rolled an 11 to kill Devan. I'm going to search her body. Tarvis. Oh, what a dick! I'm still searching around there. We're hardened criminals, right? This is what we do, right? It feels real wrong! Do I find the jewel? Find jewel. I look at sigil on ground. Any symbol that looks like previous symbols? How do we get out of the room? What if we-- (sighs) I throw dagger at Dren. 17? Seven points. That was probably your finest haiku. Oh, shit. You have two hands. You have multiple hands that you can use to pull levers. While this is going on, I'm cutting off Devan's hand. Oh, I have tons. What was that? A classic Liam uplifting ending. (laughter) That I love Tarvis? Not romantically. I'm indebted to you and I would do anything for you. I also knew that. I think your first line of dialogue was, "I'm in love with you secretly!" (laughter)
