D&D Beyond everybody, they've been such great sponsors, putting up with my shenanigans for so long. So tonight I thought I would just do a simple, normal ad read for them. Just singing their praises of the service of the company, how they're making D&D fun and easy again. So I just wrote a little, quick little-- I left it at home on my printer. But it's okay, it's okay, no problem. I'm essentially like an improv god, right? So I'll just make something up on the fly. Just go from the heart. Okay. I like D&D Beyond. Because it works on PCs and Macintosh. And that's very important because-- And their logo is neat. Yeah! A priest and a rabbi walk into a strip club at-- Yeah. (singing) I'm gonna, get get get you drunk. Get you love drunk on my humps. My humps, my humps-- "You are an idiot. Ugh, why did I make a satanic deal with you? Your everlasting soul isn't "worth this bullshit. I, Mephistopheles, hereby release you from our pact. Go on, live your life "without my constant help and sense of humor. Sam Riegel, I, Satan, am done with you." (slamming) That's true. Sue us! They're flying off the shelves! Is the Critical Role YouTube channel called "Critical Role" or "Crit Role"? Weirdly, the Hamburger Helper organization owns it. (laughter) Yay! He is? Teach your son. Dad cap! No it's good, it's good, leave it! Thadeus Candleglow? Yes! The jail. No one else on this side of the table is going to take any meaningful notes. It's dick pics all over the place. And this one looks like a poo in a bathtub. Yeah, that's a good idea. Maybe he's new. Were we called that back then? I don't remember. Oh, good, yeah. Thank you for that, that's very kind. Passing through. All right. Thank you for that. Yes. Yeah, we did. Let's go to the Feed and the Mead. What? Yes, to me. Any crazy news around here? Or just the normal stuff? The people we rescued from that cave nearby? Are they all fine, not, you know–? He was crying when we rescued him. Is there anything that can speed up that process? Some papers or forms or stamps? Here? We know the Starosta here. So we could just forge another one! Oh, sorry! If it's too hard to pick, you can do top three. Was it? We must have all seen it, but– How did it compare? In terms of just being giant or, like, well-proportioned? Symmetrical? Just leave your post! Go AWOL! Come with us! You're such a good-- Oh, no, we got this one! This one's on us. Your money's no good here! I'll fucking kill you if you try to pay! Good night. I don't want to feel like a burden on anyone, you know? Oh, yes. Well, I can wear my mask, and I got these lovely gloves. What? What are you talking about? They look like real fingers. I'll see how long I last. I don't smell good to begin with. It's true. Stink-ouflage. We have to sleep here, it's nighttime. TRAVIS and It's Zemnian for "good morning." It's too complicated to teach. The accent is very difficult. That's actually very close. That's kind of close. Yeah. It's on the way, yeah. Nope, no thanks. That's nice. I like fish. All right, let's go see it. No, Caleb, save your gold for paper. Or incense. Do you want some more? Just a little mad money or anything? We're awesome, yeah. Where are you going? Thauma-gurgy. What's going on? The rocks look weird? What does that mean? What do you have? Do you need me to come? Do you need me to touch it to disarm it? Pull it out! See what we've got! That's fine, but give me a second. We should make sure there's no tracks. We clear all the tracks away. Oh, so they're not in that bag? Yeah, let's replace them with other rocks and put them in. Yeah, but it's not us! We're not all good yet; we're trying to do good. There's gray in the middle. Should we leave a note throwing them off our track? Like, "Oh, you know who took this? Fuck "you! Love, The Iron Shepherds," or something like that. I'm going to start going around and trying to mess up our tracks, maybe leave a few deeper footprints walking the other way? Oh, boy. 19. Naturally. Plus zero. I'm better with other things. Our group inventory, though, is nonexistent right now. Can you be in charge again? You're fired. Behind us or ahead of us? Wait, no, we're inside an invisible-- Are we stopping here? We've got to stop for the night, right? Wait, do people hate us here? I've forgotten. Well, we're in Trostenwald, right? Von Brandt for me, please. I think he's in jail, isn't he? You know, with cats, it's really all of their emotions are your emotions projected on them, anyway, so that's how it works with cats. They feel nothing. You can't win! All right, but before we go over there, are we going to plunk down 2,000 gold to get this near-stranger out of debt? We all do if we pitch in together, I'm sure. I have almost that much. I never pay for anything. Heavens, no. No, I didn't say that-- I feel like you're putting words in my mouth. I'm just going to get down on my knees and start licking the milk as well. (laughter) No, let's go now. Caleb, I lived it, so I remember, but for Caduceus, can you remind me why Gustav was locked up again? (laughter) I know, but what did he do wrong? But that wasn't-- how would he know? This is an innocent man! He didn't do anything bad, right? Herewolves? Werewolves. We're all going to grow facial hair for next week, right? You too? Cool. Your friend and ours, Mollymauk, is no longer of this world, and this would be a way of us saying-- putting his legacy at peace. If we can afford it, no promises. Which was? Is he a bad guy? Well, then, maybe we should leave him in here, if he feels unsafe on the outside. I can't-- just looks like a dude. Caduceus, how will Fjord-- how and when will Fjord die? We've been in a cell. It's not fun. Well, let's find out how much. I thought it was 2,000 to start?! That's kind of rich for my blood. If we put all of our money together, how much would it be? No, save your 50 gold. I can put down a thousand. What was the other number? I don't know if Deuce is abrasive; just sort of awkward, aloof. (sneezes) (sneezes) LAURA and We all divided it. He put 400, 1000, 100. That's mine. I'm trying to figure out what it is. Is it DPB? Is that right? Big peanut butter energy. Is there a place called Natural Remedies, maybe? Or maybe the general store? I don't know if it's possible-- Can I get components to make a Tanglefoot Bag? The chemicals needed for that? It's a chemical thing, Travis. You wouldn't understand. I did not. I looked on the printout that Matt gave me. The one page that I needed to play the game. What do I need for that, for goopy stuff? Tar? I don't know. Is it a chemical thing? Yeah, I'll turn into a little gnome or something, and go around and shop, and get all the components I might need. Oh boy. Yeah, that's a two. Oh, but deception's a minus three, so. Yes. So, I forget to turn my lower half into a-- (laughter) Yes! All right, well, I'll just go then, I guess. Oh! Looks like I've got a thing! Well, I'll come back tomorrow and finish shopping here, and I will definitely not flee town today. (laughter) Boy. It's a cold day. I think I'll just pop up my hood and walk a little brisker. Maybe just-- Oh look, what's that? And I'll run into an alley that way. Advantage. Ooh, that's even worse! 17. It would be so easy. All right. I'll just rejoin the others. The dice have spoken, Matt. And we're about to get-- Border patrol's there and they're checking every wagon. Is there a button? Dispel? But then it won't come back! How about this? What about this? There's-- we're not the only cart on the road, right? Waiting to come back through. We could plant some contraband on one of those carts. In the kerfuffle, they'll be like, "Hey, you! You guys are arrested, you're under arrest!" And we'll be like, "Oh, we'll just skate through." If they poke the stick in, the stick will disappear. I have human jerky. If I tell them it is-- Okay. And if they ask why there's nothing, we have a story, right? We're going to go pick up a shipment and bring it back. Just me. I'll do the talking, right? Shouldn't Fjord? I'm going to change into another form of some sort. Just a halfling. Or a tiny halfling lady. So truthful. Come on, Deuce. Drop that deuce. More whispers? Wow, he's on a roll. What was that? I heard some of the whisper. I heard it was crazy! What do you mean? You didn't tell me we were going to giant-- What? Or just him. Matt made this map, and you just blew it, Taliesin. There's so much in there. You know, let's just attack just 'cause. Yeah. They really have two heads? Oh, god. Wow! That was incredible. And now we're in a totally different place. Caduceus, that was amazing! And Caleb, even better. Jesus. (singing with the music) Doesn't say there's any saves? 24. How far is the closest one? How far is the closest one? (snarls) These fucking things. I know. Because I'm hidden from their view, right? As far as I know? Hmm. Yeah, I guess I'll hold. I mean, otherwise I have to shoot at it at disadvantage. Eh! I'll take a shot at disadvantage. I'm hidden, though. D'oh! That's a ten. I can bonus action fire again, or I can get off this cart of death that they're going to be swinging at pretty soon. I'll just shoot again. Oh boy. 17. Sneak attack or no? Oh, that's great! I'll use Fury of the Small. So that's 25. Bodak. Budak. Yep. And you're on your own. We'll be back in a few hours. Oh no. Caleb, no! But they can still hit. Yeah, Summer Dance! (singing) Everybody summer dance now! Me again! Oh, but I'm not hidden anymore? Oh, that's true. Fjord's engaged. Then I will-- sneak attack still? Yes, no, maybe? Oh, yes. Then I will shootsky. Yeah, so that's 20 something. Okay. Wow, good roll. 21. 21 damage. Great. I will use Disengage and hop off the cart and try to run up next to Jester. You're on your own, Fjord! You said scatter! Yep. Caleb, no! Oh boy. You were in jail when this happened last time. It's the British Invasion. Oh no! Jester got run over! He's much less damaged than the other guy. Let's get the fuck out of here! That wasn't Beau's turn, though. Me? Oh gods. You're going to be stopping the cart? With that thing? Oh no! All right, I'll-- Okay, well then, I'm going to run up to the dead body and hide behind it. Or in it. Then I'll hold my action until the other one starts moving towards us. And bonus action hide back there. Okay, 21. It moves towards us, within 30 feet, basically. Ah! It's another giant! I hope they're in his junk! Oh, no. Yes. Why are you shaking so much, Beau? Is there anything on the giant's body? Worthy of stealing? 24. I'll take that. I flick off some of the beetles off of the goat meat. That's mine! Get off! From here? Jesus, we're going halfway across the world! It's a zoo. It's a traveling zoo. It's a traveling zoo! I'm going to, I guess, stay far, far back. Just watching from a hidden position. (gasp) One girl, two cubs! (laughter) (laughing) "Should we have some--" We're going to get them, but what do we do? I'm going to eat one of those animals. (laughter) At least one. A couple weeks? And next week is also the premiere of Handbooker Helper, right? Don't put your dick in the peanut butter too much.
