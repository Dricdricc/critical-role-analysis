He also plays Black Widow. Here we go. A Grog-jack? Yeah. Oh. Because I did, too. No, I want to hear yours. Let's do them both without telling, and just see what happens. That works with my plan. My plan was to-- was to go in there and distract them while you did something! (all laugh) I hadn't completed the thought because the something hadn't been worked out. That raises the stakes! (all laugh) And plan over. Yeah, he went in anyway. Oh, Jesus! That's not very stealthy at all! We've been doing this for 30 seconds. We're already in a fight! I was going to distract them! I'm going in. I'm walking into the camp. (sighs) Well, the best laid plans.... 12 versus armor class? I'm okay! I step forward and say-- is her name Ulara? Queen Ulara. Show yourself! Step out and talk to us. Everyone hold. She's in the tent. She's in the tent, right? Do I roll again? 22. Queen Ulara, if I may have a word. Let us spare each other lots of bloodshed and just have a chat before we fight. Is that all right? My friends and I have come-- Hi, yes... We've come from the above world. The normal world, let's say, to your fine kingdom down here below. And we were on a mission. We're a bit of-- I don't want to brag, but we're a bit of an elite task force, sent in by kingdoms and kings that you probably haven't heard of way down below, but anyway. I'll spare you. (laughs) Copy that. My lady, we have come on a mission. To save someone that you were holding captive. We have completed our mission, and in the melee, in that hovel you called a palace back there, we lost one of our own, and we would like him back. Now, I'll make it very simple because my fellows are begging me to keep things simple. It's a simple binary choice. You can all die right now, or you can turn over our friend and we will probably, probably leave you in peace. I would promise, but I don't make promises to dogs. Saving throw? What is that? Okay. 21. 18. Hey, is Grog stone? He's unconscious. Okay, so all that's remaining on the battlefield is the queen and the mind flayer? All right. (sighs) I'm going to just bum rush the queen. And just dive at her. Just dive full, head-on, straight for her and bear hug her with Banishment. No, you have to-- it's touch. It's touch. I do most things through that. Ooh, get lost, motherfucker! (all laugh) Yeah. It's not you it's me. (all laugh) Oh. I don't know things. Target, plane of existence, banishment... I don't know. Where does it say? Find it. (all laugh) Yes! Do I get my bonus? I'm going to give inspiration to Grog because he needs it. For instance, busting through iron bars. She's in a better place. Is he on something? She's carrying the whole thing? Awesome. Awesome. "(singing) Oh, don't hit me!" I cast a little count, cutting-- what is it? Cutting Words. That's d10? I don't even-- I've never rolled a d10 before! (laughs) This is a d10? It was a four. He misses! (all laugh) (singing) No, don't hit me! Do they know each other? Are they friends? That's nothing, that's no numbers. That's a good number. He ran? Don't hit me! I don't like guns. Yeah! (all laugh) You want to chase them? Fellows! Gather around. She might come back at any moment and we should be here to surround her when she comes back. And someone get Grog out of that thing! Or he can pick a lock. Checking for traps?! She could come back at any second, hurry up! Is Pike okay? Hold her! I also cast Hold Person. We have everything that we have come here for. What can you possibly offer us that we don't already have? Let you go?! I tried to talk to you and you almost tried to get us killed! Try to heal her? You're looting her already?! I'm going into the tent to look. Anything in the tent? Oh. Superior healing. All right. Great. What the hell? What is it? "Just my cunning wit!" I don't even know what a head slot is. Oh, can you share? Killed her friend? It's only just begun. Let's talk now. We'll bring him up to speed later. I might be better at that. Kima, can you take a walk with me? I would like to persuade you to take a walk with me. 24. There's this thing on my body. I thought maybe you could take a look at it and you could tell me if it's good or bad? I don't know. I have an earring. I use my Minor Illusion to create a purple third nipple on me that I show her and ask her if it's okay, or if it's-- Is this normal? It's just, I trust you. I feel like I know you. You know we had that thing back there and then Keyleth was yelling at you. What was that all about? Let's girl talk. Get on camera. Get on camera. Over here, over here. Hey everyone, buy a t-shirt!

I cast Polymorph on myself, giving myself a gigantic dick, and I slowly pull down my pants... Oh, this bulge down here? Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon. I check under my belt because the spell has worn off. And I'm back down to my normal one and a half inches. Which on a gnome is pretty big. Length! And girth. It's like a square. Like a cube. But you'll be vulnerable, won't you? I can make you a modest spot to change? Oh, you know what, though? Before we go any further, I remind Pike that Vax's foot damage needs daily repair, doesn't it? It's like a weasel on your leg. Of course. I'm singing to help him, to inspire him. "(singing) Push it, push it real good! Push it, "push it real good!" It's pretty spacious in here, I think. (all laugh) How far is the chamber? You're just going to go down the hall? Bear trap! (all laugh) Who's in there? Just Vax right now? I feel like Pike wouldn't want us to do too much damage to these bodies. I just feel like she wouldn't want us to disturb them. I'm going to inspect the gnome. 19. Who's he? From the Value of Valor. Tremaine? Was that his name? Oh, it's something. Amulet of the Shield. It protects you. Once per day? Is he dead? Oh, that was easy. I'm going to take the ruby, too. No! Awesome. Should we go there? Should we skip it, Clarota? Yeah, that's a lot of fungus to get through before the city. Are they still down there in the water? Let's wait until they get back before we decide. I don't know, we bought one (laughs). What's down there? Do you need help? That's all you got? Well, should we try again with someone who has better perception? What? He gave the other one to me. Percy could assist. He's got some engineering. Oh! Yes, of course. Oh, I do. Yes, I will inspire you. I don't know what to sing. What's a boat song? How does it start? (singing hesitantly) Something exciting's waiting for you? (all laugh) (singing) Takes me away to where I've always heard it go. You want to try the Mending Wheel? Let's pile in the boat. I just want to know which way we're sailing. Are we going left? This way, or do we want to go this way? Let's just set sail. She's a shark. I'm not curious. Go in the cave? I already have a ruby. I'm fine. I'll come. Natural 20. Vax, why don't you go mess with them? Are we all in the cave? No, that's the right pronunciation. It's happening soon, and we're just going to be talking about Critical Role. (all laugh) There's only 20 more pages. Say that again? They want to make my Singing Dawnblade? The night is young. Not just this weekend. In six hours. What is that?
