D&D Beyond, everyone. Yeah, there's an animated thing that, if you haven't seen, you should check out, that's pretty cool. As announced during the Stream of Many Eyes this past weekend, new adventures, Waterdeep Dragon Heist and Waterdeep Dungeon of the Mad Mage, are now available-- on Laura's phone-- for preorder on D&D Beyond. Check out the D&D Beyond marketplace now to learn more and order now. And the great thing about D&D Beyond, guys, is that it simplifies managing your stats and inventory so you can just focus on creating. Creating new encounters, creating new characters, creating new monsters. And I thought I would inspire our audience by showing them what kind of-- some samples of some new monsters that they could create. Now, you could use the same old stats, but maybe you give them a little new spin or a new flair. And to help, I made some artistic interpretations of some of my new monsters. So these are some new monsters you can create. You guys have all heard of a bulette? We fought them? Well, this is a bull-ette. It's a female bullet! You can tell 'cause it's pink! Yeah, I printed out a picture of a bullet and I colored it in pink. And it only fires once, so it's a very quick encounter. You've heard of a displacer beast? This is a Despacito beast. It's the same thing as a displacer beast, except you hear "dub-a-dub-a Puerto Rico dub-a-dub-a ay, bandito" when it goes invisible. No, I drew these. You guys have heard of an owlbear. Well, what about putting a little creative spin on it and making it a bowel-bear? It has crippling IBS. Oh, there's more, guys. Yeah, it has a shit-spray attack. Here's one I'm pretty proud of. You guys, there's a monster in the Manual called the giant wasp. Well, this is the giant WASP. But he's a White Anglo-Saxon Person. A WASP! You know, a WASP-y guy! He's a WASP! Yeah! That's not true? I don't know. Okay, there's two more. Okay, there's two more. This is a bone dirtdevil. It's a bone devil that cleans up after every fight. Yeah, I drew that one! Last, but not least, it's a Fanta-core! (laughter) You like the bone dirtdevil? Guys, there were more that I didn't even draw. There was the Lin Manuel Miranda-boleth. (laughter) Check out more on my website. But there's fish men and possibly fish women right down there that could come out and kill us in our sleep. What if there's unlimited numbers of them? What if there's a whole-- You only saw like five. Did you keep going down into the tunnels? We're just going to gloss over the fact that Fjord has three bird nicknames? That does not sound good. It's like a sound board. Wait, if you get really excited, you should go (air horn blaring). Are we going to sleep? For today? I did not. Oh, I did. We have to save it for tomorrow. Second as well. That's a four. High roll! Oh shit! No, we're on watch. We haven't seen anything, it's just a dream. We should wake everyone up! Fjord! (cawing) Don't wake up Kiri, though. She deserves a really nice night's sleep. I'm going to give her my blanket. I remember saying that we should hide the corpses and Cali actually said, "Don't do it, "there's no point to it." So we should blame Cali. That's what Cali said. Why don't we just blow up the hole? Why do we want to go down there? There's crazy people down there! You could just say, "Be quiet." Thank you. We woke her up, though, but it was cute. Is our rope still dangling down the hole? If it comes up, should we grab it? I fired and missed with a natural one. You're going down there? By yourselves? Take good care of him. He can't make it without you. He will not come back alive. He will have no chance of survival. Okay. I'm going to cast Message. Are you still alive? You can reply to this message. Oh, yeah. While Yasha's waiting, she can clean up the bodies. You can reply to this message. (singing) Run away, run away! This is your five-foot greatsword? (laughter) It's much better. It looks good! Or Jester might want a bikini. We're going down there? Again? Under the water? How many v's are in that word? I don't do well with water. I don't think I can go down there. Why don't I stay watch? I don't like water. Probably. I don't like it, though. Taking the piss. I'll stay with Kiri. You guys can go, and I can stay with Kiri. I'm not good at many things. (groans) (groans) I'll stay with Kiri, and if there's trouble, we'll see what happens. Pass Without a Trace. I mean, I don't like fighting, but sure. We could tie the rope-- oh, we can't tie the rope to you, because now it's tied on the other side. So you're a fast swimmer. Can you still cast spells? Oh, okay. Sure. My duty is to take care of Kiri. Right? Sounds like Caleb. Wow. Jesus! What is happening? Why is there a remote control? Ooh, it just got blue! Oh no. Single digits and 21. What about you, Fjord? One. I have a plus four to initiative, so I guess that's five. My natural one beats yours. And influence the election. Tolled. LAURA, TRAVIS, and That's pretty good. The booby-looking thing. Take the stubble off of it? Come on, Yasha! Come on, Yasha, plan ahead! Yes, let's. Did you guys scan the area for Despacito beasts? Ooh! That's a lot of spells. If we survive this. Yeah, Hasty. Wow! I'll send a Message to Caleb. Are you guys alive and do you need anything? You can reply to this message. Uh-oh. That's it. I'm going to think about it. She got shocked so hard we saw parts of her dream. (laughter) Were you saying the Curse of the Islands? I hand the books to little Kiri and I say Keep these safe. Good idea. I'll take a little bit of fleece and rip it and cast Silent Image, and make a wall of stone around Kiri. Just say Don't move. Go over to the water, put my foot in, and then-- withdraw it, and take a big swig. (laughter) Sheâ€™s got, like, 100 more points. This is your thing, you are strong! So you're rerolling for him. You're great at jumping over small bodies of liquid, Marisha. You're super fast. Remember, you're super fast. See, Kiri, I think they would have called if they really needed me. I think no news is good news, and-- That's probably a good sign. And the water looks cold anyway, and you could get hypothermia, so, you know, I've got to protect you, and, yeah. That's my turn. (laughter) Refresh. It's in your notebook somewhere. Your character sheet. You printed it out somewhere, right? Mildly hurt. Guilt attack! I'll take one more swig, and I'll jump in the water. Bonus action dash! Where are they?! Let me at them! I'll save you all! Get this water off me! Ah! I'll shake like a dog. Can you see into our world? Cat's Paw's gone. These dice are wrong and bad dice and they should be put away forever. Did Laura go to deliver the baby right now? Seeing my friend Caleb down, I'm filled with a mighty rage and I will draw my crossbow, load my Burning Bolt, and run at it screaming and firing. That's a 20 to hit? (counting) Fury of the Small, 21, plus the Burning Bolt is another three. 24 total? On the first hit. Is it still alive? Bonus action, shot. 22 to hit? It's just one now. Another eight points. That's it. Oh no, you're all grouped together. Oh no. Is he within the cube? Decides to kill Liam forever. That's only three squares, right? It doesn't have to be in front of you. It says in any direction. You're looting him before he-- Not attractive. Wow! I didn't even need it because I wasn't hurt at all in the fight. The baby can hear all of this. Roll for dilation. I'll help him. Oh, okay! I can do that. Are there any boxes or treasure chests? With disadvantage! That's an eight. I'll take those. If you're going to meditate, maybe go back and check on the little bird? I think she's okay, I left her in an invisible-- I made a false rock. Let's hear it, Liam. Is it locked? There's a locked box? Two boxes? Okay. Yes. Sounds good to me. I'll try-- Should I try to open the box? What is it? What are they? Oh, okay. I'll cast Mage Hand from afar and try to unlock the big box. Oh, an 18 and a 19. (sing-song) Whoopie-doopie-doopie-doopie-doop, click! No, I'm opening it! Fuck off, grandpa! Is it a super long blade? Or is it like a rapier-type thing? No, I don't think-- We'll melt it down and sell it for raw gold. Could be the end of a sending stone or something. Should we take them all? Ah, you're a cyclops! Kill her! He's teaching you magic. Listen carefully. You'll learn new spells this way. What did he just say? Oh, yes. Okay. Should I open it? All right. I'll finger it from afar. It's a one. I'll open it. What is this, thieves' tools? I'll never figure this out. Dexterity plus-- I rolled a ten. There's no blade? Well, this was a metal box. No. Let's wait in real time. 11 minutes. No. He said before that it didn't look like the blade made the gash in the eye. Touch it, meaning his penis. Oh! He's dead, he died. What the fuck was that?! What just happened?! Did the ship sink? Or maybe he's cursed and he's going to turn evil and kill us all in our sleep? Or maybe your father is a sperm whale and that's how you survived, because you're half whale or fish. I think that that's likely. They wanted this eye thing. For having the thing inside of you! Maybe they can sense it. We solved it. Just like his dreams. Can you breathe? Can you breathe underwater? Or it can only be on the full moon, or something. I know mythology. Can I just point out, not to be a jerk-- Can we put them all in the bag? What do you mean, "where they're supposed to be?" They stole it from the smugglers. Any shortswords better than my shortsword? I like mine. Do they seem sharper, or deadlier? We're back up on the upper level? Should we blow up the tunnel? I don't, but two of us do. Wait, do I? We have two of them among us. I think it's Molly and Fjord. They were probably smugglers that were keeping the safe house for the Gentleman. Or taken prisoner. Oh my god! We're the worst people ever. This makes me feel awkward. That was really good, guys! Yes it is, she was really rude to you and-- Find our way out? I think we have (cocks crossbow) a troll to find. Or we could just leave. Did you just Salt Bae them? Wait, where was it?
