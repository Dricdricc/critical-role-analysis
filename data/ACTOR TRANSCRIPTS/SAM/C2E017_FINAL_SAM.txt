I did it, guys! Yeah, I'm looking in my inventory right now. It says "Emmy Award of Exempla--" It won't tell me the rest of the title! (laughter) It's a wondrous item! "Rarity Legendary. This enchanted statue was given to the finest of "creatives in the land. It's a large thinly-coated lead icon made of cheap material." I'm going to take a picture of that later. That's so cool! Guys, as you know, this week I received many emails from fans who loved our D&D Beyond ad last week. And they told me that I had missed part of the story. To recap, our sponsor is D&D Beyond. They are contributing $100 to 826LA for every natural one we roll. Also, as part of their massive 826LA charity initiative, we're past the $10,000 tier, so D&D Beyond has offered up the discount code "826LA" for 25% off their awesome Legendary Bundle, which includes all the digital materials available on D&D Beyond. Last week, to honor that, I had dug through the archives and found a commercial that D&D Beyond had run in the '80s. We did a staged reading of it. Fans wrote in and said, "Sam, you missed part of that story." The ad campaign in the '80s was not successful. However, it launched the career of the young actress who played Gail in the commercial. She was given her own spin-off sitcom on CBS. It only ran four episodes, and those episodes have been lost to time. But I was able to find the script of a promo for the sitcom starring Gail, from the D&D Beyond commercial, from the 80s! Found it in the archives. We're going to do a staged reading of this promo for this sitcom. Brought to you by D&D Beyond. I'll be playing Announcer; reprising their roles will be Laura as the mom, Taliesin as the dad, and Ashley The Johnson as Gail. Here we go. Picture it. You're watching TV. It's 830PM, primetime, and this promo comes on. (announcer voice) "This fall on CBS, it's the hilarious sitcom everyone's "stoked" about "You've Got Gail!" That lovable scamp Gail gets her foster parents, the Hendersons, into totally "gnarly" situations. But it's not all fun and games. You've Got Gail also tackles serious issues. You won't believe the trouble Gail gets into every Thursday night! All-new You've Got Gail, every week right after Growing Pains and before She's the Sheriff. Presented by D&D Beyond! (laughter) The character of Gail is amazing. D-O-Y. You'll have time. Get a wireless headphone so you don't wake him or her. Yeah. Just play. It'll be great. (singing) The bears are back in town! Your spidey sense is tingling? Lots of pockets to pick! On the what? The mote? (whispering) Where is that? Is it near Xhorhas? Right there. Everybody! Does anyone know how this festival works? What are we celebrating again? It's just for funsies and we go around and sample wares and things? I've been to a festival. Not a big one. You know, small ones. You know, end of the season and beginning of the season. You know, that sort of stuff. People's weddings, that sort of thing. Don't curse! It's not a dead person. It's a skeleton. It seems old. I mean I suppose it's a dead person. I guess so. It seemed human-ish. Should we join them? Wait! No, not open carry. Open container. Let's go! What was her name? I'll put on my mask and join. I'm going with Caleb. Want to come? Go with them, then. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. $100 for 826LA. Jester, use these. I'm looking. I'm going to hold my wire up to my mouth. Four. It's the one on the right! The right one. No! You're getting the wrong one! The right one! I'd like to compete please. Yes please. Yeah, here. That's a natural one. (cheering) I will choose-- eenie, meenie, miney. I'm going to pick the one on-- the middle. I failed you, Caleb! I'm so sorry. I took your silver, and I let it go. I'm sorry. I know, but it's the principle. We're okay. Thank you. He won a silver, but I lost it. King's Vault. He did not answer your question. I will take that bet. I'll bet against her. I got one gold that says she cannot do this. I don't think that's how that works. Here's one gold. I just wanted to fire her up. I know. You've never had a candied apple before? It seems so basic. It's honey and an apple. We have to share one? Should we go after her? I can hunt her down. Those festive book stalls. Candied books, candied books! Throw a dart. Win a book. I'm going to walk over to the Eagle Shot, was it? What's that game look like? Bows? Nah. It's too hard to pull it back! This thing does it for you, look. (click) LAURA and I guess I could go ask. Excuse me, sir or madam? I'm wondering if you have to use a bow and arrow to compete or can you use one of these? I'm not going to fire it at you! I don't have anything wrong with it. My father is over there. Yes, papa. This one is pretty good. Now I feel like we have to. He just human-splained me. (laughter) That'll be fun. All right, let's do it. We will both enter your competition. How far is the farthest one? Let's try. You don't have a sword, do you? I can't work with this kind of pressure! Oh man! I'm not proficient in this thing at all, right? I think it's fletch-- yeah. One more shot. You can do this! Yes, it's my turn. Do I add proficiency and-- 11. What is that? 12. Far target. 15. Shut up! I don't need you to condescend to me! Give me another one! Thank you! Two, in quick succession. 20. I'm not done! I get four more shots! Two in quick succession to the middle one. Oh, well then. Should I reroll? Okay. I will still use your shitty dice. Two 23s. Then two more. To the short one. 16 and a 21. You can have both wooden swords. Oh, it really is. Would you like the rats? Well, we can share. Oh, I can wait. I guess. Later. It'll be a celebratory-- we could candy them. Don't cut yourself! Burn the place down. Oh no. You're making out with your god? Gross. A Sam Riegel-type. She's the worst. Audition for our acapella group. We've heard of that before. Beau lost. No, he's really not. Yasha, you should do it. You're very strong. I don't think that's helping. It's not a beauty contest. Dueling natural 20s? Their arms rip off. Blood is everywhere. Oh, yeah. Matt, may I cast Message and send a message to Gunther? I'm going to quickly say Kendall is getting to second base with your wife right now! Do not respond to this message! (laughter) Oh shit. Jester! Should I shoot him?. No, I think this is for Marisha. I'll take it. To travel incognito, but-- Yeah! I won this doll before! The king or something? They've got business cards? That is so cool. We need something. Absolutely, right now. While we're waiting, can I just say, why did we not think about branding? We should have coins, cards, you should be writing a big nine on a wall wherever we go! Like everywhere, just tagging it, just everywhere! Because we're the Mighty Nein. I know! They don't know that. When you say it out loud, it's much easier that our symbol is the number nine, don't you think? If you did know, then you'd be one of the cool kids. That could be a while. Aw, man. What a festival! Yes, very. That's true. Four groups. Are there frightening beasts? Big beasts? Magical beasts? Then why are we doing this? We're going to fight dangerous monsters. Kylre. Fighting monsters! That's what the guy said! We're fighting monsters. Should we go find out what's going on over there? I could sneaky-sneak over there and listen. I will cast Silent Image and I'm going to go up to the corner, make the image of a three-foot by three-foot box around me. I'm going to just (quick footsteps). Stealth? Oh, wow. 19. Can I see through the box? Oh, it's a listening perception. Four. (quick footsteps) Still in box form, I am going to go back up to them. Hey guys, it's me. I'm in a box! No, it's not a real box. I'll stick my hand through it. I heard everything! There's an attack on Ashguard something. Okay, thank you! The King said we're going to declare war on Xhorhas or something like that, I don't remember. Then there's 1000 dead! The skies were black-- I don't know! Maybe ours? At the Garrison there was 1000 dead, so that's our side? Wait, no, we're not on sides! We don't like the Empire! Anyway, but they wanted to declare war and they're not going to until tomorrow. Yes! We should throw the fight. Do you have a tramp stamp back there? I'm in a box! (laughter) 18. Wow. Nine. There's just something about him. Bander rob? Oh, shit, it's us! This was such a good day. Whoa. Did you print that? On a laser printer? Where's the doors to the-- oh, they're over there. Got it. I will be behind the pillar over there. No, this one over-- yes, thank you. Whoa! Oh, 16 here. (demonic voice) Present! Oh yeah, go closer to the creature. That's a good idea. I don't like it! It's scary! Oh, no. Or breathe some awful breath of death. Yes, it does. She's huge! 14? I will shoot my thing at it! 21 to hit. Is Yasha-- Okay, (counting) 19. Wait, you know what? If I'm going to be honest, that thing is beyond 30 feet, so I would have moved in closer so I don't have to fire at disadvantage. Then do I have any movement left? All right, well then I'll dash and I'll go back around towards me, behind this corner and hide. Just duck back there. That's it! Take a swig. Just run away. What could happen? (deep voice) I'm sorry, you have to talk like this now. You added all your shit to that? Does the Enlarge give her advantage on saving throws? Oh no, Jessie! It will certainly be fixed, because D&D Beyond is a responsive company and we love them. 11 plus eight. You have Sentinel also? I think it's my turn. I'm going to stick my hand around and fire my little crossy-bowy. Not good! Not good at all. Ten! I will reload and fire again. Oh god! Should we count that? I don't know. Matt, do I count that or not? Okay, 18 to hit. I get sneak attack? Great. 15. I'll take Fury of the Small, why not. 19. Back behind a wall. If you think that would help. You're a great player. Whoa, that's a lot. Remember, you're twice as big. Oh no. Can we use some medicine? Wait, but the poison will go away eventually, right? Won't it? Make that check! A lot. Oh wow! You need to heal! Like what? Like don't run up so close, or at least wait a little bit first to gauge the beast. Don't run into the -- You're going to die! Oh, that's not us. I can make a box! I can actually make a 15 foot large box! We could all fit in it! Keep our distance. We don't know what door they're coming out. Did we see which door the last two monsters came out of? That was the last one? No! Of course not! Dead center. I'm going to cast Mage Hand. Nine. Two for Caleb. Or her. Butt turkey? (groaning) Oh, jeez! Wait! You're out? Damn. (shouting) Pick one and focus fire on that one! You raged too much in the games of chance. Okay, I'm going to aim for that flap of skin. Fire. 25 to hit. That is 16 points of damage. I will run. Nope, I will fire again. (reloading) Same place. 16 to hit. Six points. I'm going to run this way, as far as my little-- well, so I can still see everybody and the action. That's great! No! You're still strong. I do what I always do, I fire my crossbow at the beast, for a 14 to hit? All right-- ooh, and it's sneak-- Oh, 12 points of damage. How's everyone-- is everyone alive right now? Yasha's right next to me-- I mean Beau. I will do the same thing. I will reload and fire again. That's a miss. Ten points. Ten to attack. I'll duck behind the wall and hide like a weakling. Terrible. Oh, no. Oh, no. No toll. I've been drinking and hiding. Oh that's great. That's huge. Wow. Healer. I think Laura is the best healer we've ever had. (laughter) Oh, no. Everyone-- Wait! Wait! What if we just stood next to all the doors and held our action until something came out of them? What are you talking about? Yeah, but we get a hit in on them the second they came out. Why is that a terrible idea? We would get a surprise round on them! Yeah, so pick four people I'll take one of them. Let's do it! I'm taking a door. I love it! I'll take a door. Just pick me a door. This one's fine, it don't matter. (laughter) Wait, we come in from one of the doors, so there's only four. Yeah, there's only four doors. I stay where I am and I'm casting Mage Hand. Holding my attack! I'm staying and I'm holding my attack until something runs out of my door. I'm ready to shoot anything that comes out of this door. No, I'm not. I have a crossbow feat. I-- I let my crossbow bolt go. Just out into the-- "Oh fuck!" No, not at it. Nope. That is a huge thing. Would have gotten two hits in. We're just as far away from the thing. Yeah, but there was two people standing next to that door. At one point there was Fjord and Caleb. If you had stuck to the plan, you would have gotten two hits, and we're all just as far away as we were before. Ma Well you shouldn't have been that far away.
