Yes! D&D Beyond is our awesome sponsor. It's a great online mobile access thing that you can manage all sorts of stuff. I'm losing my voice tonight, because-- Yeah, I know. So that I can preserve my voice for the rest of the night, Laura, can you read the copy and I'll lip sync it. Thank you. Laura Oh god. As you know, D&D Beyond is the official digital tool set for Critical Role. It's got a ton of features, but one of the coolest is that it keeps track of stuff like hit points, inspiration, and all sorts of modifiers to your dice rolls, which is amazing, especially if you're the kind of person that's more focused on which dice you're rolling with. Oh, keep going. What?! No! That's not what it says! (laughter) I don't know what happens. When? No problem with our setup. We're fighting already? Nope! I rolled her dice, it was a one, I'm never rolling it again. Is that German? Five. I have five. One plus four. You guys are out in the open? The horses have better initiative than all of us. Cool map. It's still alive? Nott is going to hard charge out of the tent. Not at the beast, but across the courtyard. Yes. As fast as she can go, saying Shit shit shit! Can she make it to that box? She can't? As she's running, she's going to fire her crossbow at the dude. 11 plus six, 17. Okay, so that is seven points of damage and sneak attack damage? Another two points. Oh! And why not? I'll use Fury of the Small! Add another two points. Yes and then bonus action can I just hide behind that thing? Apparently? Travis is using magic. Man down. Seeing one of us die scares the shit out of me. No, dead forever. (laughter) I start charging out at the beast. I get about halfway. I fire my crossbow (wailing scream). Fire the crossbow. That's a natural 20. (cheering) I'm low to the ground so probably in the back of the calf or something. Before it falls, I'm going to turn and run into the tent. I don't even know if I hit. (screaming) It's a cantrip? It's designed for this moment. Oh no, she's not proficient. Use my dice that I gave you. Yes. That's what I'm hoping for. Is there any young girl in the tent with me? Natural 20. That means I have to go. The smell of sulfur, I mean brimstone, do I figure that it's probably the residual from the big toad guy or is there a substance in the room that is causing it? A religion check? One. (laughter) I'm going to try and get out of the tent through the side. Like underneath the side and towards the horse. Yeah, back there. Looking for Caleb. No, not yet. Is he okay? Did he live? Did everyone live? Oh yes I do, hi. Yeah, so he can't be far. Okay. There's horses around here, let's steal them. Might I point out real quick, up to this point we are fugitives who haven't committed a crime. But starting now we will be fugitives who have committed crimes. Are we sure we want to do this? All right, let's go. But I have to find Caleb first. Should I shoot them? The white one? Toya's gone, right? Sorry that we thought that you did it. Briefly. Saddle up. Where are we going? We're going with them, then? Wait, what? How did we never know that? How many suns are there? Just change the license plate. No? "Back in time"? (laughter) It's really shallow. Shouldn't we weigh them down with something? We could write a little note and put it in one of their pockets that says something like "I've discovered that Caleb and Nott are innocent and should be cleared of all charges", or something like that. Sure. How do you spell Jester? Okay. We were going to go along the north way, right? The toad went due north? Like straight into the water? Could be. If we're chasing the toad it seems like we need to find a boat and go out into the water. Steal that boat? Well no, we are just going to find the toad. You said this. We're camping and waiting and resting. Or swim. You can hit dice it. Do any of us know what's beyond? Like what's on the other side of this lake? Is it a mountain? Do you just need ten gold pieces? We're going to go shopping at three in the morning? Six? To hit a horse? What was that? I don't even know what that was. Thank you. I already rolled once. 11. One day down. Two days down! With D&D Beyond, it does the work for you. There is, there are two rest buttons, Liam. They're down towards the bottom, short rest or long rest. Gross. Were they dead? Go down for breakfast? I'm always with you. Yes? You saw that? Sorry! Would I know that it's made of platinum, just from glancing at it and feeling it? Not great. Just an intelligence check? Eight. I don't want to get rid of it. That is a tough decision. But this is the only one I have! I only have one flask. Oh, but it's so pretty. How about this for a counteroffer how much are the books? Here! I like this better. (laughter) Stop! I come with him. Your accent is confusing. Sure you don't want to-- Sure you don't want stay here and shop around some more? Okay! Okay, but I could've perused some of the aisles and it's a long-- okay! I've always had it, you never asked for any. I collect things. Among them are pieces of gold. I have more. Ooh! You made my cheeks all green! He gets like this when he's studying. He gets very focused, it's best not to disturb him. Should we go look for the toad? Ooh, he has it written down? On a thing? So Fjord, you're very acquainted with seamen then? Having been on the water for so long? Are there clusters of seamen around you at all times? And I saunter away. I mosy away. (laughter) They have a vulnerability to poppyseed muffins. Jerking off. (laughter) Roll for spanking. But they still said we couldn't leave. Does Molly always smell of patchouli? What else do you need? I jumped on to the octopus and it served as some sort of a landing pad. It killed the octopus, but I lived. I've tried. I was very hungry. Buy some, what, incense? I've been to one of these places, it's called Natural Remedies. Herbs and medicinal things. It's up the street a bit. Maybe. Or I could sneak in and grab it for you. That sounds fun. Do sparrows see in the dark? They're daytime birds. We should do this quickly before the light goes away, right? No, he can't see you. But I will tell him later when he asks. We're all sitting around in this room, watching him watch TV, essentially. While this is going on, can I whip out my little chemistry kit and start putting together some chemical stuff? Acid. I'll start it, then. Get in an hour of work. We talking just one braid? French braid? One. (laughter) Sorry. I didn't mean to, I was-- It didn't go through the entire floor, I don't think. We'll move the nightstand over a little to cover it up. No one will see. I pour some water on it. Oh no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Caleb. Thank you. We'll mop it up with some towels and whatnot while it's still iron. No, the coin was magic. It was a magic pot that we sold you. That is your power word. Sorry. Sorry. Would you like back the two copper pieces you gave me for the pot? When we were investigating, we were-- Bad Cop. I was the bad cop! You're not leaving here without telling us the truth! I'm crazy! I'll bite her too! Yeah, it was crazy. She confessed to being a little girl. Do they cut themselves like you? We meted out the truth! We cracked the case wide open! Toya. Unless, and here's my new theory the big frog man can leech the life force from people? What if Toya is a fully-grown adult woman, but he's been slowly leeching so much life from her that she's a small husk. She's a tiny full-grown person! Oh, she's just a dwarf? Oh, okay, that makes more sense, actually, when you say it that way. It seemed like she was shrunken down from magic! One of his tentacles! Not just tentacles, dwarf tentacles! Let's go. I think we know all we need to know. That tracks. That fully tracks. Let's go. Gesundheit. On the way out, can I grab some booze from the bar to fill up my platinum flask? Or to fill it up a little? Great. I'll mark it down. As am I. I'll keep lookout. Oh yes, here it is. Come on, charis. We're fine, we went out the front door. We're going out the front door. Does she have disadvantage on all checks for the next two days? That's how I would rule it. I'm real! I'm with you! I said that I would be on lookout duty, so I'm just peering-- Wait they went to the alley to go? We'll go with, right? We're just going out in the open to the water. I'm guiding him along. Nope. Yes. Caleb, where are we headed? Boink. You monster! (laughter) I'm drinking tons of whiskey because I'm super scared to be on the water. Nighttime beach party. That is true. All you need to know is, there's three dudes and three ladies. You do the math. That seemed to work. Heavens to Murgatroyd. I did a Travis burp. I blew it that way! Guide you through. The exact order that our minis are, right there. Well, not the exact order. We're fine like this. We're all going to die anyway. 16. MATT and The whales are in my power! Did Toya love crabs? What? I didn't burp! That was you?! I have not burped. There's a full hut with a witch inside, Matt. (laughter) There's a full, two-story hut with a burning fireplace. Everybody, or just her? Look at this well-constructed map. They? It's just one. Toya's just a dwarf girl. 11! Wait, you can't see because you're looking through the sparrow, or because you're a human? That's why we're holding hands? Irish, Laura. Three!? Not three! 15. Still 15. Use your D&D Next to look at the information about that spell. Wait, did you have two minis made for yourself? Ah, wow. Crush that windpipe. Okay. Seeing where Caleb has run-- If I move, will that imp next to me get an attack? Okay. Well then, I will turn to the imp next to me and I will slash at it with my shortsword. Two. Two plus six. Eight. All right, I will bonus action disengage and run to Caleb. They can't get us over here. (laughter) Every time he casts a spell, does it go (sings Dueling Banjos). (laughter) Oh boy. No. That's nothing! You're fine. We each have like 150 hit points. Juggernaut. He's so wise! 19. Gore! It's a roll off! It's because she is really a tentacle. She is part of him-- I mean I can-- seeing Caleb surrounded, Nott will leap on to the beast's face and stab it in the neck. The big one. I'll disengage first. MATT Okay, so you disengage as a bonus action. Move over-- 19. Nine, ten, plus fury of the small, 12. No problem. And you lose all your gold. Get her done. Are you a bard?! What the fuck? 16. Ten. 22. Eight points. Why do I get sneak attack? All right. 11 points. There is an imp still in front of us? Okay. I will just shoot him with an arrow. I'm like ten feet away? 15 feet. I'll draw and shoot. Oh boy, ten. And then I will-- I really do. I will cover Caleb's body with mine. We'll see. 16. From an imp? It's pronounced "verd." Okay, with one hand I will try to cover the bleeding wounds of Caleb, and with the other hand, not even looking, I'll just fire my crossbow at the other-- (laughter) One. I should've looked! That's a six. I'm blinded by tears! (laughter) I mean, I can't do anything. I can run over to the other thing, but I can't do anything, so-- And my boy-- I don't know that, but... I'm just staying. I will try to stabilise Caleb using no-- Natural 20. And I will do mouth-to-mouth. Ugh, that's what she looked like? (laughter) So it's just gooey flesh? Those are very nice. They are very pretty, yes. Where did you find them? On the bag? Can I have one? What if she's evil? Authorities. I'm going to try to take one off. Eight-- 26. I'm just going to say, I did it. (laughter) What does that mean?
