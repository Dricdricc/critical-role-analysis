Liam, they're excited about reading. They love books! Do you want us to step out so you can have a moment? What? What does that mean? You're going outside? Into the inside of the volcano? Use protection! (laughter) Meanwhile, inside. I'm just so happy to be back in the group. (laughter) I love you, too. Not in a weird way. Just friends. Oh, just how much we love life. That's a great idea, Grog. Invisible servants, bring us the finest vegan wine. But no added animal fats. You know what, though? I know in the past, Vax, I've had my differences with you. I didn't like you charging after that dragon that one time, and we had some issues, but tonight I feel like we're close and you would never do anything to betray me. Let's take a sip. But first, I was thinking about how close we've become, Vax, and I even wrote you a little inspirational song. (cheering) Okay, sure. You'll hold my drink while I sing. This is just a song to show you how much you mean to me and how close we've become over these years. It's a long one. (rapping) Don't be tired, I'm here to inspire. Before you blow out, let me light your fire. I got no choir, just a gnome and a lyre. So listen up to Burt Reynolds, esquire. (rhythmic clapping) You been down but what's it going to take to give you some sack, man? How about 2,400 Critters chanting, "Vax'ildan! Vax'ildan! Vax'ildan!" (chanting) That's a 12. Yeah! That's good stuff! Man, I just feel invigorated! Let's see here, what do we got, six people over here? Oh, okay. Then I'll roll a d4. One, two-- oh wait, it's just three. It was a fucking four. Two! Okay, Keyleth. Oh shit! Well, then it's just Vex or Percy? Or wait, are those two, too? Okay, well, then it would be Grog. Do I have three choices or four? Four choices! All right, and could you raise your hand if you're one of my choices? Okay. One, two, three, four. It's Percy. (cheering) A human man? That was teenage years, baby. I've gone much further than that since then. I don't know. I don't know if it's the wine talking, but oh man. I feel something I've never felt before, Percival. I've never seen you in this light before. Your eyebrows. I want to lick them. They seem soft. That came out wrong. What I meant was, what are you doing later? I'm sorry! It's just, well, you've seen it. (laughter) The way he looks at you and everything stops. The way all sound fades away when he's talking. The way he cocks his gun. (groans) Holds it so firmly. It trembles just a little but then bang. (moans) Just a gentle touch is all it takes. It feels like forever. (singing) One song, glory. One song to win your heart, glory. Where do I even start? (singing) One song from the pretty boy gnome. Love knoweth no boundaries, and even though there's a significant age difference between us-- I'm not at liberty to say. (laughter) I want to see you naked. (smacking) Yes. The lights. Yes. No, we should talk. We should strategize. (laughter and cheering) I cast Mage Hand to tickle Percy's knee. 20. I'd prefer it if Percy did. (laughter) I don't know. It was love at first sight, but now, so not first. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll try to keep it together. I'll think of gross things. Victor's ball sack. Ugh. Why are they so singed? All right. Okay, let's focus up. Okay. Go on, strategize. Kaylie. I think. In my room. I have all the guards I need. Don't worry, I'll be safe. So we're going to sleep and then to Vasselheim? Okay, let's do it. Yes. Sorry, Matt. I know we're trying to get to other things, but magic compels me to put on my best silk g-string, and it compels me to use the series of tunnels that interconnect all of the rooms. That only I know about. And it compels me to sneak into Percival's room in the dead of night and crawl into bed with him. Are you in there?! I thought it was like the 50s, where you had two twin beds. Then I guess I better be extra stealthy. Okay. I think that's going to work. Eight. (laughter) Let it happen. Just a check? Ten. I'm sorry! I don't know what's happening to me. I know that this is your marital bed. Can I at least watch? I promise I won't look at you, Vex. I won't look at you at all! I'll just be looking at Percy. (muffled agreement) (muffled agreement) Ha ha! Just a birthday prank. Is it your birthday? LAURA and Oh, got the date wrong. (retching) I need to change. I have jizzed in my pants. (laughter) Have a good evening. The main door. For the lulz? (laughter) (husky) Hey. (clears throat) Didn't sleep a lot. Sorry. Hey, Percy. I don't want to talk about it. Let's hurry. Quick, cast Lesser Restoration on yourself! Residual magic. TRAVIS, SAM, and We don't need the sass. Well, maybe the miracle thing is just the change in weather, and we'll be okay. (laughter) 27! A live whisper. But the ring, man! We just got the ring! Ten minutes? 15 minutes? What are we doing? Who are we missing? Why? She was just here with a bear. Guys, thanks for coming to the show. TALIESIN and I love Percy! (laughter) We need Brian Foster to come out here and talk for 20 minutes and get the crowd hyped again. That'll work; that's fine. We know of two places to go to up near the something mountains. Zenwick Mountains? Sure, we'll definitely stay here, then. Definitely be here the whole time. Praise Vecna. Don't worry, he can't be killed. Just like all of us can't be killed. All right, we can talk freely. The Crypts of Fomora or the Silted Bale. The Silted Bale. Fomora. Sure. We know a general sense of where we're going. Those are the only places that we know within the Zenwick Mountains that have any appeal. Yes. One of them is filled with crazy dwarf cannibals. And the other one has ice mud that can heal you. All right, including ourselves? (laughter) We don't know. Let's take her. One thing that I can tell you about the Crypts that you may not know. They're not man-made crypts. They're actually the inside of a fallen titan's body. I know things. (laughter) It's Friday. All right. To the Crypts, I say. But are we druiding there and then flying on a dragon, or just flying on a dragon? Well, shall we away then? We have to go now! We'll try. They're right! Well, let's get going before he starts raising this thing. Come on! Or three of us could each have one. I thought our whole deal was we're about to go do a surprise attack? We have to go now. When it turned 12 midnight, the alarm clock went off! Everybody gets one. Guys, I'm fine. (laughter) Why would you feel any pressure that way? We're best buds! All right, I'll take two. In Marquesian I say, thank you, J'mon Sa Ord. Also, if you don't like the Meat Man, I can make him go away. Thank you. Let's go. We've got to get through this druidy thing, right? Do we know where these things are? What do we do? How? We don't know much about it. Shotgun! If you need a second to think about it, it's okay. We can start off first and then come back to you. Do you need a second to compose yourself? Sing it, sister. 19 total. Oh. Maybe that's where they ripped the thing out. Oh, his feet are a hundred feet across?! At least a hundred feet big! Maybe even bigger! Liam, are we getting closer? Follow the tracks, then. Are you going to take him, one on one? We can stop this, though. All we have to do is beat the titan. I've got magic missiles that can do 1d6 damage. We could be in business! Should we land on the city on its back, or should we try to fuck up the titan? How far have we gone? J'mon, can you become invisible, by any chance? I could affect a couple of us. Three. Or! I could make J'mon look like one of those dark flappy things and make us look like undead creatures? Yeah. Invisible, then? We'll fly through it; it won't work. If you do the thing, we'll keep going through it. Let's do invisible! Yeah, I just knocked over a wine bottle. MATT and I can do four if J'mon can't. Okay, so we'll do four and four. Do we see a clearing? A landing spot? Eight. Is it coming from the city or coming from the titan? I got an 11. You guys have a fucked-up relationship. J'mon, they say they're okay. It's okay, we can go. Is it pee-colored? J'mon, they're fine. They told us they're fine! They'll be here any second! Don't worry. See you guys tomorrow. Get some sleep. Thanks so much; this was a lot of fun!
