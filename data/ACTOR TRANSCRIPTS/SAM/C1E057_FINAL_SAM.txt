Video games! Giving out crates? Loot Crate has donated two Loot Crate DX boxes to give away to you. We will be doing this at the break and at the end of the night, random in chat. You must be active! Stay tuned for that! Exclamation point! Remind you, gotta stay active. Are they all going to be like Boaty McBoatface or something? (laughter) Boaty McBoatface is like an online "name our boat." (all say Boaty McBoatface) Yeah. Do we get to show it, or no? You're wearing the shirt. Pitbull Chasers. And there's a place to click on the page where you are right now watching this. Signed, by the way, signed by us, not by the artist. (laughs) (sighs) Light a fire. Well, you're the one who brought us here, Vax. Where would you like to go? We'll come with you. God will wait for a long time. What? (laughs) Are you hazing Loran? Cyndrian. Mertin. Mertin. Merkin is a different thing. Fencing them. (quietly) Ancient. You're super salty today. That's typically how it works. TALIESIN and Haven't we had them for years? Where are we going to sell these? The world's on fire! Thank you. Kord's strength to you. To whom? We haven't ever sold them or come across anyone who wanted them before. We also are almost full in our Bag of Holding, might I remind you, and 64 pounds would free up quite some-- It's 64 pounds. To whom? To be fair, have we ever gone back for something before, ever, in our entire travels? What? I'll come with you, as well. You might be blown up if you go in there. Want me to go in and investigate? Oh, good. Not dead, then. Is Victor in there? Well, should we just purchase what you need via the honor system and leave some coin behind? Your mine? (whispering) Something's happened to him. Grog, can you get him out, can you lift him up? Ugh. I do have a question, actually. Yes, I do. I'm just looking for a hat shop. Is there a hat shop around here? Oh, god. Ugh. All right, thank you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. That happened today? No, but Keyleth can, and I think that would save you a lot of time. No, but we can go get her and come back. To just fix his hand. Someone can restore something. Maybe Pike can. I think he would prefer a real hand than a claw hand. (laugh) I would much rather you spend time on projects for us than projects for him. We have party members who can regrow his hand. All right. Oh, you want me to make-- we have the Slayer's Take. They have a workshop, don't they? I need a big hat. All right. Maybe, if we pass one. We're going to leave. Too good. (chuckles) Four gold. (singing) I drew a dick on his picture. (laughter) I'm going with Grog to shop? All right, sure. Yeah. I'll do it. Yeah, we'll go for all that stuff. Do we find success? What is this, just charisma? 18. Do we also find a hat store? If I can take an extra side journey to find a hat shop, that would be great. It's just hats, Grog. We're just getting hats. The Sore Socket? I love it. (laughs) Oh, man. Wow. Yeah, we've come to the right place. Hi, ma'am. My name's Scanlan. This is Grog. We're just-- I needed one hat, but you have such a fantastic selection, maybe we'll pick up a few. Let's get some hats! It's lovely to meet you. We've heard so much about this store. Yes, far and wide. I'm here to buy just one quick thing in particular, then we'll be on our way. I just want a very tall hat. Just very tall black hat with a point. Like a big triangle hat. With a wide brim. Like a wide black hat just like this. MARISHA AND All right, well, it was worth-- I could come back for it another day, perhaps. It's not for me. Well, her head's a little bigger than mine. Sure, how much? More than worth it. I'll take it. And also, can you get something for him that would really accentuate his features? Yes, you need a hat. But if it rains, Grog. Something in a yarmulke, perhaps? I love it, Grog. I think you look great. We don't have a mirror here? Maybe something with spikes? I did, that was a good line. Wow. I mean, your silhouette is magnificent. Imposing. You are. You are. We should go to a silhouette artist after this and get something drawn for this. They do, they cut it out. Our mom only gave us 60 gold to spend. Could you give us both hats for 60? We're brothers. (laughter) With disadvantage?! Well, would a 1 be bad? (laughter) All right. 20 from me, 50 from him. We'll take them both. My name's Scanlan Shorthalt. See you soon. Look at that. Look at that. It's crazy. Did you guys get him drunk or something? I guess so. Whatever. When I delivered the materials to him-- Could I have inspired him at all, when I delivered the materials? All right. I will inspire-- oh my god, it's not even worth it. Okay. So when I delivered everything, I just sang him a little song to inspire him. And I sang, That was a 10. A 2. Plus 10. Fingers. You don't know. (laughs) That's a great toast. Aah. His ring. I assume so. I don't know. We're going to spend the night, at least. Put "it" aside? Oh. You're gonna jump her, eh? I'd like to go to the Raven Queen. (laughter) You've got him. No, I would like to take 12 hours to read my book. No. Lots of centerfolds. (laughter) I don't know what that is, but someone will tell me. Wait, there's a giveaway at the break, I think. Bathe in blood. We'll see you soon. [Critical Role resumes at 22243] Do they sell potions and things here in town-- Then let's get the hell out of here. There's nothing for us here. Oh, yeah. Me? I thought we waited for the hat. There's the Feywild. There's dropping stuff off at Whitestone. There's Marquet, which something is there in Marquet? I don't know, everyone just keeps talking about it. Wait, weren't we going to go to-- And there's one in the bottom of the sea somewhere. Normally? Grog's been to the Feywild. Oh, is that where we're going? Oh. Sounds like fun. To the Feywild. How big is the Feywild? Is it like a football field? Well, how do-- do we know where we're going in the Feywild? Terrible. Good question. No one can see it. It's back. It's back. The Ozmit Sea? Ohhh. We could. The one in the bottom of the sea is called Whisper, right? It now lies at the bottom of the Ozmit Sea, sunken with the lost ship, The Shrew. A storm three hundred years ago near an island of glass. Anyone know about the island of glass? Onesies. Did they say where it was? Damn it. Come on, sailor. It was tamed. Yes, Whitestone. Good call... (chuckle) Attaboy. Percy, we are in a place that has an airship dock. We could go steal an airship. It would be so cool, though. Before we leave, do you want to sell these stupid white dragon scales? All right, let's go. Someday, it will be ours. Passenger. Nope. (whispering) You're talking to a tree? (quietly) Because it's winter. There's a border patrol? Oh, the wolf. What's his name? Oh, boy. Harold? Shaun Gilmore? MATT AND Can I accompany Vax on this trip? I want to see Gilmore. Yeah, we've been there before. Yeah, let's go. I guess we'll head down to the ziggurat. Business? What business, Gilmore? Aww. Little? Oh, I know. That's true, I suppose. I suppose. Yes, absolutely. We've been spreading the good word about you and your works. Oh! That's a nice compliment. And the big hat? They do. Oh, I'll dress up. I'll dress up for dinner. You two are at the kiddie table. (laughter) Show some class, man. What? (scoffs) Science, Percy? No dragons have buzzed by here in our absence? The Unmentionables. And that it's in the Feywild, but nothing more. The Shademark Balg? Ugh, it sounds awful. Okay. Well, that helps us. Those are clues. Fenthras, Wrath of the Fey Warden. Okay. He speaks to the sea? Cookie Monster. Druid-y things. Well, she asked it, so, technically, it's hers. Then we could go inside a dragon again. This is an awesome dinner, by the way. Super good. That's true. What's a house, really, but a bunch of bricks. So we rest here for a night or two and then, to the Feywild? Or to the-- True. Yeah. Pike could go off to get the ocean one herself. Yeah, I like the ocean. I don't really like the ocean. (laughter) "Barkeley." Frankincense? True blood. I just told Pike she looked real pretty tonight and I go back to my reading. Good job, man. Because he's always almost about to die. This is exciting.
