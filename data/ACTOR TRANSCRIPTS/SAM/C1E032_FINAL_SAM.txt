Or fails at it. They're really good. Pink and proud. Well it's not there, either. All screens have our show on them. Who's in it? Matt, you're in it. Is it just Matt? Is that it? Who else is in it? Yeah, I was all over New Vegas, as well, so they cut me out. (shushing noises) That's a lot! I'm ready to announce it. What is it? Is that true? I'm famous! I did it! I did it! In newspapers everywhere? I love it. Not yet, though. Big dreams, Taliesin, big dreams. Okay, here we go. Shit. We just got to the tree line, right? Oh, Jesus. Five! You never could keep a lady. (laughter) And now we're doubling back. Yeah, I ran for a few more feet, and then I looked around and no one else was running with me, so I turned around and restarted running back with my little gnome legs. (panting) While he's doing that, I'm yelling at Grog, "Grog! Throw me up over the wall! "At least to the top!" She's lost weight! (laughter) You broke the gun? It's weighted. I want to go up there. Pike's up there! Hi, baby! It's been so long. Man, you look good. Aw, man, I'm so distracted by your beauty. Hey, let's kick some ass together, shall we? Ladies first. Hey, what is she rolling, huh? By the way, can I just say, that's my girlfriend who just did that. (laughter) Okay. I'm going to-- she jumped 35 feet out there? Can I do that? Jesus, that was hot. Man. Yeah, I'm going to try to jump to her. (laughter) Got to limber up first, stretch out the calves. For love? Yeah, four. (laughter) Ooh, that's a nine. Okay, do I still have a move, or is that my move? Okay, shit. (laughs) How many are in my line of sight? And are they clumped together by any chance? Oh, great. Okay, then I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt on them. Will I hit Pike? Is she in my line of fire? I will angle it, then. (laughter) Oh, and also, Lightning Bolt comes out of my body? Can it come from my cock region? I would like it to just spew forth out of my gonads, just at them. I'm trying to impress Pike! I've got a lightning dick! Oh, well it's not a-- it's 17. (counts quietly) No wait, that's 14, 16, 20, 22! I'm sorry? 22. Punching? She killed 36 of them! Get your doilies out. 16. Or kill them. There's two. Giants. Let's go get the giants. Hold that thought. Giants, yes. Are the two giants together or are they coming from opposite sides? Let's split the party. Oh, I'm with Pike. (laughter) Everything we've done in this fight is the stupidest. Let's go. All right, big and smalls are going south. Yeah, let's do it. Let's help him. She's the best. (laughter) She just is a people person! He's a good guy. It's okay, it's okay. Initiative, Ashley, initiative. No, he was a good guy. You did good, kid. 16 for me. We'll go last. She said six? Aw. Six for her. I'll go first. I'm not going to do much, but I will take out my Wand of Magic Missiles, because I've got to use everything I got. And I will shoot, fuck it, six missiles, I'll use six of the slots. So it's three plus another five. Every day it recharges and I rolled and it's back up to seven. I am using six of the seven. What do I do? 11. I don't-- what am I adding to this? Yeah. Okay. Three, five, eight, 12. 14, 15, 17. 17 plus eight. 25. As my movement, I'm going to-- where am I? I'm going to move just in that thing. Where's the laser? I don't know. I'm going to move to my left into that little alcove there. And I'll sing a song of inspiration for Grog. (sings) Well now Whitestone's got problems, and now we really can't solve them, unless we make really deep cuts, so baby show me that Grog blood! (laughter) He's right there, but go ahead. Go ahead, Pike. Light him up. Most of his damage comes from behind. Wait, what? Oh no, Grog, that means you're going to get that much damage. From Pike or from everybody? Next attack has advantage, I defer to you. I'll hold my roll. Oh, you have advantage too. How far can I move? 25? That's it? Can I get next to Grog? Can I get near Grog? Can I get at an angle where I won't hit Grog with lightning? Oh, I don't care about those guys. (laughter) All right. I will try to hit him with a Lightning Bolt, but miss as many people as possible. Okay. I will angle up. This time, I would like the lightning to come from my ass. Yes. And I'll just lightning him at normal lightning damage. Oh, I have practiced aiming things with my ass in this campaign. (counts quietly) 28. What? I just farted lightning on him! I'll inspire Pike. I'll turn to her and I'll say, (sings) I wish they all could be cleric gnomian girls. (laughter) Friendship? Aw, man. Two? As my reaction, I bring up my shawm-- it's a horn-- and I blow the note. The note is like Dumb and Dumber, the sound he makes? (off-key horn noise) That most annoying sound. (off-key horn noise) And mash all my fingers down. This is my trying to-- Cutting Words! What is this? TALIESIN AND One. That hits. Oh, my shawm! Oh, god. That misses! (laughter) I'm ducking down to work on the shawm. (laughter) You mean physically or mentally? Because I'm in love with you. (laughter) Oh, I'm fine. Don't worry about me, baby. Stolen on the subway on the way home from work. Ooh. Wait, what? Why is she so goddamn powerful? Matt, while she's rolling, can you describe her hair at this moment? Is it whipping around? Is it in her face? Is it covering her eyes in a sexy, sweaty way? He's ignoring me. Which means? Can I faint? Oh. I'm just waking up. "What? What's going on?" 24 hours. Prepare. Wait for our signal. Spread the word. Should we loot? Should we loot them, first? (laughs) That would be in poor taste. We should start heading back. We probably won't get there in time. Wait, Percy said to meet in the west. We'll head west to our appointed meeting spot. As we go, I'm looking at clotheslines for any sort of beret type of a hat. (laughter) 13. A yarmulke? Anything? I'm a little thing. I have a little head. Maybe it could be just a shoulder pad. All right, fine. Initiative, initiative. "Oh, I was reading a book. Sorry." They both fail. It's been a long day. We've had three sessions. Keep your cheated die all for yourself, there. So light him up. Stupid Pathfinder. It's fun. Nothing you do does what you want it to do. So you're pulling him towards you? That's a no. Nice! Are any of them in berets? Damn it! Are you trying to grave rob right now? How is everyone? Did you defeat your giant? You know who defeated ours? Pike, because she's the fucking bomb. Pike, come here and give me a hug! I give her a hug. What happens? Just how I remember you! Warm gelatin. Many decisions. We've decided to take down this horrible foe, and Percy's been grappling with a lot of decisions as we've gone. Percy's thinking very clearly. He's fine. He's allergic to cats or something. I have lightning coming out of my ass. 12. And Pike? The cough. Did they blow it? "Man-done." Can we get in it? Well, we have two gnomes with us. I hope so. (laughter) Oi! I can't see anything. (laughter) This feels so cool. It's like a shortsword for me! (laughter) No one down here, but I don't know how far this thing goes, and I don't know how well it's guarded. And camp in the tunnel? I put Vax's dagger in my back pocket. Cover it up with my shirt. Seven. Not in front of Pike! (laughter) Of course you can. Ooh! He had two. He still coughs. Pike, that was incredible. Yeah! He was right here the whole time. Excuse me? What are you doing outside? Can we do it here? Wait. Pike, do you have any sort of Cone of Silence, or anything? Do you have a Cone of Silence? He's going to make noise. Where's passive perception? The guardian's got this. I look around for Pike. Five. We should have a feast. Well, that is a problem. Pike can't help in any way? I have questions for us, while Pike is looking up her spells. First question is how on earth are we supposed to send a signal to the rest of the town when we're in a tunnel? From where? Is that our plan? We're going to say, "Rebels, go," wait a while, and then attack? Shouldn't we wait a little? Remember, last time I was supposed to create a diversion... Believe me, I was amazing, but maybe we should incite the rebellion, wait a half hour, and then go. Well, that's another question. We are. Does one of us need to go out there and lead the rebels? LAURA AND What do you mean, no? If he survived the night. Maybe Pike should. I'm just saying, if Pike is fading on us, it might be best to send her out to lead the rebels. And if, in the horribly unfortunate scenario where she can't. Pike, can you leave us anything? A potion. A spell. A prayer. A symbol. A "siggle." Anything? Oh. Oh, a sigil. I said it wrong. Heroes' Feast raises all of our hit points higher. And advantage on wisdom saves. Seriously? Go? Go where? What? You've got to go outside first. Okay. Well, we still can. (laughs) Before we do this, I love you all, and I wish us all the best of luck today. I especially love Pike, and I'm so happy she's with us for this. If some of us don't return, I think that the glory of what we're doing today, and the justice of what we're doing today, has been worth it, and Percy, I hope you get some sort of redemption in all of this. To the de Rolos. Let's all go down the tunnel. I've got this, guys. Wait, why are we pushing this thing? I will push, as well. I'm helping. I am not helping. 11. Wait, Pike's going to do this? Doors, man. What? Mrs. Shorthalt, you are amazing. Pike, will you carry me over the threshold? (laughter) Oh, you just happen to have the room drawn? Let's go talk to the old prisoner. 15. That's with plus ten. That's not the direction of the voice. Oh, it is? Psst. Oi. Hello. If you want to get out of here, don't speak loudly. We're here to help. I hold it up to my face. I grin a big grin to her and I say, hello. We're friends. We're here to bust you out of this place. Will you tell us who you are? Gloria Cyn? We are ninjas. No, we are against the Briarwoods and all they stand for. We're here to save you, the prisoners, the village. Everyone we can. I am not alone. I have friends with me. Some of whom look quite scary, so don't be alarmed if a bear stands right behind me. It's a good bear. It's the best kind of bear. That's my friend Vex. Vex, come forward. Why have you been locked up? We're great with old people. We should unlock that, maybe we should unlock this cage. She can run out the tunnel that we came in. Madam. Good madam. When you were brought into the castle, can you tell us anything about where you were brought? Were you brought before the queen-- she is a queen, right? Lady. Were you brought before the Lady, and if so, in what room? Where was it? How big was it? How many guards were in there? You have beautiful eyes. Did those eyes see anything in that grand throne room? Entrances or exits? Large windows? Anything? Oh, fuck. Never mind, Matt. "Were there any guards? Many guards? Lots of guards?" As she's talking, I'm going to see if there's any sort of arcana or magical incantation on her, or any sort of possession. Is that something I can check for? No. Can I just do an arcana check, or is that not-- I don't know. All right. Then I do nothing. I sing a little song. She's fine. Let's leave her. Let's feed her to Trinket and go on. If you please. Can you raise a blade? Can you fight? Let's leave her. Ma'am, you must believe me when we say you are much safer here than above. Ma'am. Here. I'm giving you a magical whip. It will protect you against anyone who comes down here. Just hold it up and it will chase away any demons. Yeah. I take the whip back. (laughter) Old people love us. By the way, how long has this all taken? The tunnel, left the lady, the tunnel. Since we've incited the rebellion. Jesus. We've got to start cooking, guys. Cooking with Grog! (laughter) Doors and old people. Perception? Oh shit, because she's going to turn into something. You've got to go to sleep. Oh wow, Wednesday?
