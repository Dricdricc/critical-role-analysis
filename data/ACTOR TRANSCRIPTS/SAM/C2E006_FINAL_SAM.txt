Hi! Hey, our partner this week is D&D Beyond, that's www.dndbeyond.com. They'd like to invite Critters to check out "And Beyond," the monthly developer update and Q&A session for D&D Beyond. D&D Beyond product director Adam Bradford will share the latest thing the team is working on and answer questions from the community. The next stream will take place tomorrow, the 16th of February, at 1100pm-- nope-- 1100am Pacific. Check it out at twitch.tv/dndbeyond and to celebrate, I'm giving out a prize tonight. It's another contest, all of you can play, and here's the rules using D&D Beyond, you have to create a character, right now, a level three character, any character, go! (intense timer countdown song) (singing) D&D&D&D Beyond. D&D Beyond! D&D! What? I don't see it. It's there. She did it. LAURA and Oh, you know what? I don't know how to call it! Wow! Wait, at a level three character? No, she's level 15! All right, Taliesin wins. See how easy it is to create a character with D&D Beyond? I'll give you a hint your prize is attached to my mug. What're you doing? Do you see how easy it is? We all created a character in, like, 25 seconds! Wait, you really named it "Sphincter?" What was yours, Taliesin? Callous? What was yours, Laura? Her name was Alight? You seem so honest. Is there a roving band of priests that are trying to find you right now? Are there any others of your family out there on the run? Doesn't sound that bad. Yeah, they're not going to kill you. What about you, Fjord? Are you going to vomit any seawater this morning? Oh, watch out! It didn't seem like the whole thing was on fire. That was very scary. One of them almost killed me! That's true. The 10,000-hour rule? What did you agree to? Why are you yelling? An hour? All right. Should we go over and talk to him? Do we recognize this person? I'm not technically. I'll join. We'll just go over and scare the shit out of him. Were you here when the attack happened? Did you happen to see where they came from? Thadeus, did they seem to be after anything in particular? Were they here for property or people or gold or food? Don't engage them. In Halfling, I say to him, I've also been a victim of a horrible attack. Oh, minus. Ten. This is really fascinating. What if we find a dead body and bring it back? Does it start with an A? Sometimes if you go down through the alphabet, A, B-- With a Y? That would have taken forever. I can't read your dice at all. She has a good eye for value. Oh boy. West Virginia. While he's counting this out, is there anyone else in the store? Anyone at all? Do I see any little trinkets or anything? Little brass things? Little baby bottles? Anything? Oh, that one fell. May I examine it? Okay. I'm going to look at it. Smell it. Look at the fluid. Do I know anything about this chemical at all? Aphids? Oh, that's nothing. It won't really do much. Sometimes. Not a lot. Speaking of-- and I'll ask him for the components to make acid. Does he have that stuff? Okay. How much for all this shit? (laughter) Just one. All right. That's fine. Wait, no. Do you sell any healing potions? You asked that already? Oh. Never mind! We're just going to go into the belly of the beast? Because one of them shot me and killed me with an arrow. We could draw them out. Thank you so much, but I don't want to be in that predicament again! Can we draw them out somehow? They are fond of meat. Here's my idea. We stage a barbecue contest. Finest in the land! All the best barbecue will be there! And then, when they come to sample our wares, I run and you kill them. Because you want to slow cook that stuff to be really good. It's true. And maybe one extra horse. He's very smart. Are we getting another horse? Why don't you four go get horses? Me and the C-man will go get some incense and stuff. Sorry! You're a seaman. Let's go get some incense! I need to buy some tarts. I need a tart. That's a bag of pastries! Wow! Ooh, I can't tell what this used to be. Is that the top or the bottom? I have two tarts! I'm taking them. On a moving cart? Are there people in the carts? Abandoned? I'm going to start drinking. I'm going to take three big swigs. (nervous) It's all right. It's fine. We don't care about the horses. Let's just save ourselves. Who cares about the horses? That's true. Should we leave someone back to protect the horses? No. All right. I'll be part of the Fjord expedition. (laughter and groaning) That wasn't a groan, that was like-- ugh. What? Sneeze? What? Why-- Oh. I see. She's lying, she's not really strong. Really? I don't know, I'm not strong. We're going away from each other? Put your alarm around the cart! You do it all the time! How long does it take to cast? All right, let's just go. I'm to the left of Caleb there on the end. Let's walk with Molly. There. Boom. Got it. 21. They're just hyenas? They're not magical, undead hyenas? Yes. No, just us. I'm going to hide. I release my bolt at that same one. 20. 13. I'm going to go pull my bolt out of the thing. Is it recoverable? Do we need to drag these bodies? The hyenas. We'll have a funeral later. There's no mine hole? I'm going to look in the carts. It's a comb-over. Why don't we just take this one? It's got sticks. Does it have a frame of any sort? Oh, it's a blanket! Oh, okay. We can take that. Wait, before we go in-- No! Jesus, no. No, please. There were hyenas out here, right, posted as guards? If one of the hyenas had gone (hyena howl), would something have come out of this hole to come get us? Then why don't we make that sound, and wait for something to come out, and kill it. You want to go into that dark, scary cave? It is a dark, scary cave! No! I'm drinking again. I don't have to roll, it just happens? Great. I'll go in if you need me to. It's a night sparrow, he should have said. (drunkenly) I'm just going to go in there and get the gnolls. Great. Can sparrows hear? I could bring the sparrow, you could at least hear what's going on, like a walkie talkie. Okay. I'll take the sparrow, jam it in there. Oh, you got to hold his hand. No, he's going to go into that other place. I'm going to go in. Great check! Disadvantage. Great check! What is this, dex save? 24! I'm okay, it was just wood. Is it a bigger space in here? Any signs of life? Anything? Eight. Okay. Real quick, I'll just poke through one of the bags. Oh, well then, okay, eight! I will freeze and slowly turn to the sound. I'm going to say, "Help me! Help me now, please come in, save me, save my life!" I am going to draw and fire at one. The first one who spotted me. Okay, 18. Eight. Ten, 11 points of damage, because I'm going to use Fury of the Small. Definitely hits. Any of us. No. Jesus. That's the other character. I'll go for the super hurt one. Who's right in front of me, right? What's wrong? That's what I'm doing. Laura discovered this last week. I'm going to go to the super hurt one and be like (scream), grab it and I'll do Shocking Grasp. Yep, that's a 19. Okay, I don't know how to do this. Hold on, is this a ten? No, that's a ten, this is an eight. Seven. Am I in range-- where's the other gnoll, is it right on me? Okay, I will bonus action disengage and run all the way around to the other side of the room. I don't know. They're very clever. I was sneaking all the way down and they still discovered me. I don't know how. That happened after they discovered me. I was about to go through them, do you want to help? Wooden shafts. I'm helping, no? No. A knowledge test? You mean an intelligence check? A water jug and an ale. Not jug, it was a barrel. Apparently I'm looking it over. Yeah, careful with that. I think maybe none of us should hold that. Maybe Fjord, he seems sort of responsible. No, don't make it a mustache. (laughter) I think if you put it near fire it could go explode. Who wants to hold it... who is not Jester? Oh great, throw a sharp object. It's fine, I'll go down the tunnel and scope it out for us. Oh. I don't know. I can look for them too, I don't know what a trap looks like. Big piece of rope, probably should have seen it. All right. I will make a mental note. Look for big pieces of rope. Don't tell me what I can and can't drink. (laughter) You want me to go ahead again? Oh boy. I'll go down one, just a little ways, and then I'll come back. I will stealth. I'm going to stealth. And search for traps. Oh good. Okay, 20-something. The first roll? 13. Yes. With disadvantage? MATT, LAURA, and That affects-- yeah. That's all of the checks. So zero. Oh wait, no! No, I did the math wrong, it's ten. I'm drunk, guys! Left. I love you. No thanks. Okay, I'll go back and report what I've heard, or what I've learned. It just keeps going and starts snaking, and there's no traps, though. Why? All right. Here I go. (laughter) Okay, and looking for traps. Stealth with-- Okay, 25. 24. Something. It's a lot. Investigation is 13. Yeah. 13. It's just burlap over a pit in the ground? It just keeps curving and curving? Oh, a downward spiral. Okay, I'll go back and report what I saw. All right, so one path goes "wiggedy woo" and the other path goes "zibbidy zow." No traps. Oh yes, there was a trap! To be fair, there was one trap. I thought you meant any sprung traps. There was a trap. I sussed it out. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. 40 feet down the "ziggedy zow" and like 25 feet down the "zibbidy zoo." You're so smart. Reverse psychology! Oh, reverse reverse psychology! Right path. I would have been bringing them down, right? Five. 22. Looks like this is the wrong path, everyone. We should probably go back to the other. Sorry. No. Including the armored one or no? Oh, sorry. What does that do? Ooh, nine. What? We're just going to go? There's no plan? He says coyly. "Would you like to see the layout of the room?" Seven? Six. Oh, Yasha's with us, right? (laughing) Yeah, they've got like four hit points. You can take out two of them in one go. If you were, you know, Grog. We're up on top, up there? Is there any way to even the playing field a bit? Any strategy? Fjord and Caleb, come on? Maybe we could use that to escape later. The other way? This is it, this is the other way. It's nothing. That's nothing. No, I'm guessing. Five gnolls. We've got these guys. D&D? Maybe it's the whiskey talking, but I think we've got these guys. How far is it on the map from where we're standing to the farthest gnoll? We can definitely do a distraction to get some of them to turn away from us. At least we get a round in. Okay. Are you going to try your thing or should I try my thing first? I don't know. I can try something! I can do a similar thing, have them see something behind them, but you can do the same thing. Yours are already cast, right? Okay. I could try to get one of them to fight with one of the other ones of them. LAURA and I'm going to sneak up, down the steps to that little crook in there. Little further back, yeah. Is that all right? Do I have to roll or anything? Oh, shit. Okay, with disadvantage? Oh, so 26. That puts me within 30 feet of those guys, right? And what are they doing? Eating hearts? Are they carrying anything on their bodies, on their person? Anything, canteens or weapons or equipment or anything? The gnolls. Are any of them holding anything that they put down for a second, or they got it firmly in their claws? Are you going to do your thing? I don't know. You tell me. What are those words? I whisper a couple words and use Mage Hand to pick up the little piece of shoulder blade he dropped and throw it in the face of the other guy. They don't care. Thought they would kill each other, I don't know. That was it. We're level three, that's all I got! I'm going to turn around and whisper to Caleb Are you going to do the thing? But I'm using Message, so no one can hear us. Are you going to do the thing? If not, I can do my thing. Damn. Oh, I get a turn as well? Because I did the Mage Hand thing. Mildly. Sure, I'll send an arrow down into the one that Jester attacked. That's 23. Nine. This is a sneak attack? 14. Crouch back and hide. Advantage, but disadvantage, so 16. Does he see me? Hi. Natural 20. Do I have to roll with disadvantage, is this dex or intelligence? Two, so six. I did, but I got a disadvantage. On stealth. Six. Okay, I'll lean out from behind Mollymauk's buttocks and rest the hand crossbow on his left cheek and fire-- --on the gnoll that's engaged with Fjord. Firing. Eight. It's that bulbous butt!Am I still hidden? No? That exposes me, do I have to hide again? How do rogues work? Oh, I was revealed. Okay. So I have to hide again. Sure, got it. Okay, I'll run up the stairs then and hide back near where Caleb is. Other side. And then hide. Well, I've cocked. Terrible. Nine plus eight is 17! Oh, wow, I'm so stealthy. Seeing the gnoll's expression, I know it well. It's one of fear and about to run away. (laughter) Okay. 19. Okay. I'm going to put the hand crossbow up and run as fast as I can, straight at it. Using my bonus action to dash, I'm going to say to it Hey, you! If you spend all day in a well, well, that's a day well-spent! I'll cast Hideous Laughter on it. (laughter) Don't you worry. Fjord, kill him! Get closer! Yuck. The end of its turn it makes a save. At the end of its turn. I can't believe this thing is still alive. It's still prone, right? So I walk up to it, and then point-blank shoot-- not point-blank, but far enough away that-- All right, I'll stand back ten feet. Oh, well shit. Then I will draw a sword and I will-- Thank god. Okay, 18. Okay, 13. I think, since it's on the ground, I would like to pin it into the ground, if I can, by finding the thinnest thing on it and jamming my shortsword into the ground. Yes. He was like Beyoncé. He was one hot Knowles. (laughter and groaning) I check for traps. Checking for traps. This is an intelligence check? For now, I rolled an 11. It's good! It's totally good. I will pick it! What am I rolling? Okay. Proficiency and dex. But disadvantage. Okay. 21. Is it a healing potion? I hand it to Caleb. You need this more than all of us. You're the squishiest. What do I do with these? I don't, all right fine, I'll take them. I collect medicine packs now. I'll keep the herbs. I'm fine. More than I think I have on my entire body. I think I just have four on each hand. Yeah. I'm good. We're fine. I mean, is this the plan? We were supposed to free living people, but we got some arms. We could bring those back. Are there any identifiable body parts? Did we do that? Yeah, Fjord, are we going to be Fjord Explorers or Fjord Escapes? Like some sort of a circle-jerky sort of a thing? All right. Am I drunk or am I not drunk? All right. Wait for three more minutes and then go. I charge ahead. Whose baby? Where are they? Why were they crying? We'll find out next week. Oh. We are? Do we know who it is?
