Guys, hi! Sam Riegel, here. It's award season, so tonight I'm going to announce the D&D Beyond Awards. The envelope, please! Okay, nervous, really nervous. There's nothing in here. Best discount codes for books in the D&D Beyond store? The winner is beginnings. "Beginnings" is the discount code! Best URL on the entire internet? The winner is DNDBeyond.com! Best picture-- La La Land. It's Moonlight. (cheering) Best way to build a Blood Hunter? Activate Critical Role content on DNDBeyond.com! Best supporting actor? Sam Riegel. Best job opening at a D&D-related internet company? Front-End Developer. I guess they're looking for a front-end developer. Someone will put a URL somewhere on here. Thank you, D&D Beyond, for being our official-- What are they calling it? No, not sponsor. They're the official tool set of Critical Role. The first annual awards show. What should we call them? Not the Oscars. The Critters. No. The Sponsees. For sure. Oh, god. I always do shows on Geek & Sundry, and this is no change. What's the show called again? I've got to help her choose her dice. I've already cursed two of them. The comic book is out. Oh, are you alive right now? How about just the head? I got one, too. Poor girl. Should we kill him? We gave him one bottle of wine. That's not very much. This is a small town, Beau. Everyone talks to everyone. You taught us that. I was never here. We never had this conversation. I'm very ugly for a halfling. Why do we need to take it with us? Us traipsing through town with a giant head seems like it would draw focus. Why don't we just put it somewhere and send the authorities out here to find it later? What are they going to do with it? It's a big head! We can hide it. Maybe some of us have skills to hide things. Just to game this out. You, Caleb, someone who is not suspected of a crime, is going to bring the severed head of a member of the circus to the police-- Either way. You, Caleb, someone who is not suspected of a crime, is going to point the police to the severed head of a member of the circus with no evidence showing what that thing was or that it was evil, and that will somehow not implicate other people who were not with us at the time. How is this going to prove their innocence, just showing a head? It's good. And I'll never do it again? (laughter) (shouting) We'll come to your house with your share of the reward. (laughter) You're strong, though. I'll help you. I'll help you. That's all right, I'm strong. One, two, three! I'm not coming with you? What if you're in trouble? You're very hurt. You've had a terrible night. Unless you're dead. No one's going to be around to save you if you get into trouble. Yeah, that's not good. Her hands are very warm. Oh god. That's true. But I didn't have my fingers in the holes. It's nighttime, the moonlight makes everything sort of look purple. 26. Did you say a shoe? A shoe!? My shoe! We took a short rest on the thing? If you want to hit dice it up. We have to kill these fucking guards, don't we? She calls it a shoe, it's a shoe ring. Do I have to go, too? But I was just a bystander! I was walking down here and I saw these two ruffians and I was going to go get help. Zero. (laughter) Three minus three is zero. Racism! They keep regular hours here. Kill them all. We're not criminals! We're not! Me and Caleb were just travelling ever since we broke out of that-- Nothing! What's going on over there? Who is going to go get the little girl? Weirdly, he's dripping wet. A little halfling girl! (high-pitched) I mean-- I'm sorry! I'm really nervous! I'm very nervous. I'm sorry, it's just your guards shackled both my wrists and my ankles and I can't move to get into a good position. Look, I have some evidence to submit. Look at my hands and also the hands of Jester. We're covered in the thing's blood. We were there too. We helped the killing of the creature. I'm sorry for your loss. Where are your people from? That's not where my clan's from. I had nothing to do with it. My clan operates far, far away and-- I'm looking on the map. Near the Felderwin Tillage. You can. Feel free. I'll even tell you where they are. I'm no longer associated with them and I can help you hunt them down if you'd like. One. It's not a natural one. LAURA and This is even more awkward. Just put me back down. Put me back down. No! The chains are pulling me one way and you're pulling me the other way. Just come down to my level! Come down here! Oh! Thank you! I would kiss you if I could. Where did you go? Were you on the lam for a long time? He was an evil fiend. When he joined the circus, who brought him in? No, he was literally an evil fiend. He controlled the girl! Also Beau crushed her windpipe. I never heard of that game. Yeah, yeah. The tickets are probably worth something! Out of the tent? Those aren't invented. No! I think, Jester-- Jester, I think it's safe to say that this first case is closed! So we could open some sort of private investigation service. Out of a tent. Aw, they took the tent. You got to jump on the tent when it becomes available. Well do we have to leave? I mean I'm not wanted anymore. (whispers) That's progressive. (laughter) We're here. (laughter) Oh, no. Um, is she coming? A little bit. You're very big. Oh. No, there's no comma. I'm just Nott the Brave. (laughter) You have to roll, don't you? Well, it was mainly Caleb. We had to get out. I mean, it was a bad place. We would have died, for sure. That's true, for sure. But they treated us very badly and we needed to get out of there. Any place is-- I mean, we've been travelling around a bit but-- I'm told east is bad too. There's monsters. Oh no, not south. (laughter) It was on top of a head. Ugh, that's really gross. I like you just the way you are. Well, I suppose we should all go to sleep and then if any of us are here in the morning, we'll set off together? Yorda. That sounds lovely and I would like to browse there again, but, honestly, Caleb, I am very worried about you. You have passed out twice in the last few days, and unless we get you a healing potion, there is no promise that you will still be alive tomorrow. I think we should go to Natural Remedies. You distract the owner while I go in the back and I steal a healing potion. It's the only way to guarantee your safety. Yes! (chewing) Bacon's really good! I'm looking around for something to swipe. Ten. Anything small? Ooh! Can I find my old flask that I left here? I'm going to steal back my old flask. 24. Mm-hmm! I rolled a 24. I'm excited. Yes, Vater. This is really nice! They got a violinist over there! I'm sorry, zey got a violinist over zere, Vater. I've heard of them. While you bathe? You'll still be the same Caleb when you're done, right? I've just gotten used to you, and now you're going to change a bit. All right. No problem. I'll just be over here, you know, bathing. I'm going to find the pitcher of cucumber water, dump it on the floor, and eat all the cucumbers. (laughter) Look around for anything in the room that can be stolen? I'll start working on that. After a while, I put a toe into the water, feel it, and I'm like Nah. I'll use my empty flask and fill it up with water. Then work on the doorknob. 12. Oh. 14. Is it a big vase? Sure. I'll try to get that too. I'll also save the flowers in a separate pouch. Any towels. Ooh, you know what? I'm going to take one towel and tear it into shreds, and use it to replace any of my bandages that have worn or fallen off. I'm good. Health pack? You're just moving things? That's beautiful! Who made this? Did you make this? You got to get a camera on this shit. Angle it to that camera. I think I had one of those this morning. [laughter] There be dragons there. I splashed some water on my face. Oh, it was such a good bath. I'm ready to go now, I feel refreshed. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Consider it paid! You look the same. Does he look the same? I wanted to go to Herbal Remedies and see if we could get you a healing potion. Auf Wiedersehen! D&D Beyond, everybody. Our sponsor for the evening. Cut to an hour later, and someone's jamming an adrenaline needle. All of you? North we go. We could rob the store. I mean, we could use one of our pre-planned strategies. We could just do the simplest the Prince and the Pauper. All right. You're right, we should leave town with our wits about us and full of health. Let's just go while we're ahead. Besides, I got plenty of stuff today. Yeah, let's go. Let's skip that one, please. They roam about. Jesus. We're on foot. A cart. This is a good trick he does. He can look at it once and it will stay with him forever. Yes, it's amazing, you can quiz him on it later. While he's memorizing it, Yasha, is that your name again? I got you these flowers. Thought that they might gussy you up a bit. It's a lot of drab colors. Also, maybe you won't kill me now. I know, I gave you the flowers. Girls like flowers. I didn't, because you're less of a threat. Sure! All girls like flowers. You see? (laughter) Well it hurts you. Are we going to walk there? Should we get horses? We'll find out, I suppose. Why?! What're you doing? By the authorities? You're so mysterious Name one. Please, Beau, let the detectives figure this out. Is it Desmond? It's Ornna, isn't it? It's Ornna, I knew it. Yes, of course. See? Another case cracked. It was Ornna. Oh! If we live. Mail fraud on the way out of town. Fjord, something in me says that, for some reason, you should be the one who tells the horses and wagon to go. (laughter) I could take a crack at it. The wagons be hitched, hee-haw. Saddle up your doggies, hee-haw. Yee-haw! With advantage? Six. I'm still a scary goblin. Ashley Johnson, ladies and gentlemen. We bought drugs. Oh, yeah. Who knows what Marisha did while we were out there?
