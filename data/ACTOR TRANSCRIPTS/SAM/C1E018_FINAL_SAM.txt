Golf claps. Who is your favorite character on the show? I think of it more as a gift. (laughter) Oi! What time is it? I'm going to load up my-- whatever this thing is. Is that what I have? That's the thing here. I'm going to load that up with an Invisibility spell. Is that a thing I could do? That's two in there, right? And I can store three spells in there, right? Three spell level-- So only one spell at a time? Oh! Then never mind. I thought it was three different spells. I've already got an extra Lightning Bolt in there. I won't add to it, never mind. I'm good, didn't understand. Grog might have something in the bag of holding that you could use. How many fancy cloaks left? Well, that's something. A what? Is that a thing? I'm going to try to inspire him. I'm going to inspire him with a little, (sings) Boom, clap, the sound of your gun, the beat goes on and on and on and on. Boom, clap-- That's all I got Can I do that? He's fine. (laughter) At this point I'm probably drunk. Wow, you could really use some inspiration right now. Stingy works. What's a minute? This is exciting. What? Me? Well, I'm known by different names in different places. Some call me Kingslayer. (laughter) I volunteer to be leader of the group. I magically make a cup appear. Have you led a group like this before? So Lyra, you are already a full fledged slayer? Have you slain? You seem like someone from The Guild. Abridged. Abridged. He doesn't care. Oh, do we get Trinket? So have you slain-- have you had any battle experience at all? Oh, I've heard of them yes. I dabble with them myself. Oh, we are from Emon, as well. Vox Machina? Castle Greyskull. Some know us as the S.H.I.Ts. We've met Aldor. We have. Yes, we met Aldor. We tangled with him. Our first run in with Aldor was not fortuitous. She means he was-- Strapping, like a dick. We'll learn a lot from hearing her talk. You're welcome. Don't we have some guilds to prove membership to? Like Moderate Healing? I think the members of Vox Machina should get them. Well, just because I-- I defer to-- I will. More for me. Did you eat enough, Percy? You've already go the bag of holding. Why don't we roll for-- Why don't we flip a coin for it? That would be great. Oh, wait. Should we ask the leader of the group, here? (chuckles) So it is decreed. Yes, please tell us. Where are we going? Should Lyra? You can do that? So sexy. This is the fine print, get to the details. Platinum dragon? I don't see race so I don't know. And do we get paid for such items? Thank you, I guess. Are you the housekeeper here? Is that a thing? We haven't encountered one of those, I don't think. In Twilight, that's true. He was a little dirty. It was hard to focus on his armor with all of his screaming and panting. We tease because we love. He did fine. He fought well. He fought bravely, and he treated us fairly. Not the face. Not the face. I didn't do it. Let's certainly start talking. Hey, Vex. Can any of us sense a dragon within six miles of here? Do we need some sort of-- anything for you to cast the spell? No, but do you need to know something of what you are trying to locate? Or does it work on name alone? Sometimes. That's better, that's better. That's dark. No, don't do that. All right. Lyra. Lira? Lyra. Yes, well I want to get it right. Who-- you've been living here for quite some time, I imagine, as a guild member. No. Unless he is knowledgeable about dragons. I was going to ask you where should we go to ask who might know things about the woods, about the wilds, about where dragons might keep? That's unfortunate. We can have some girl talk later, but right now, focus on the dragon. 23. 22. Let's go. You're not with us, are you? Her wiles kill. Yeah, get to the dragon. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. That was quite a story, quite a story. Not only do we believe you, but we want to tell others of this. In fact, I'm a bit of a performer. I may write a song about your exploits. Roll! Two. She's got a Scrooge McDuck bag? (laughter) Dagon. Dagon? I will definitely write a song for you. No, I can remember that. Will we have any trouble finding this place? Will we need a guide? Someone who's possibly been there before? Would that make the journey-- You're a member? No, I heard it was sort of a technicality. I can't wait to hear it. Yes. I could, if you told me the details. You know what, I do forget a lot. Maybe you could just write them down quietly to yourself and just give me a note later. Thank you, Dagon. You're traveling with some of them. Northwest. Cold. Dragon. Blizzard. Two days. We need horses. We need to get some horses up in this joint? Will you need some cold weather clothes, Zahra? And Lyra did you bring anything? Yeah? Oh wait! Would he have enough for us? Let's go do that! Way to bury the lede! Is this your Uncle Randy? He's legend. His legend has been sung far and wide. Rent them. Let's rent them for a week. We'll leave you a hefty deposit. Go for it. Wow. Thank you, sir! We can save a little if I shared a horse with you. Okay. No, thanks. (laughter) Should we leave Trinket? I always want to leave Trinket! Because he only almost dies every time. Aldor is-- I missed... Yes, yes. Here's our gold. Oh, thank you! That was impressive. You put her in her place. Asserted yourself, but you were-- Firm, but fair. Yes. Didn't we need to go to Uncle Randy's? You know what? She's sort of our leader. If you must know, Randy. You know what, Mister Randy? We had our doubts about your-- Oh, okay. Did you-- Really? Just go on Facebook. Facebook! Bye. You did! We'll write a good comment card when we get back. All right, we're loaded up. We've got horses, we've got healing potions, we've got-- Shall we set off? Do you want to go, one more time to the Braving Grounds, Grog, and just-- Try your hand against-- no? You're right. You're right, there is a-- All right, we go west along the Glass... Hand... Road. Tiny? Kord's strength to you, sir. Do we not have a fire going? She had already-- Zahra had volunteered. No watch. I'm sleeping, yes. Thank you. Oh, he's the worst. Wow. Your beard tingles. You mean your magic glasses. This is so exciting! Mary and Felicia don't know. This is fun, come on. Eight! You're all going to die, man! I just had a couple. They're great, and I'm sure Liam could get us some more. Oh no! You? You're eating! Oh my Grog. I sing-- (sings) No I don't want to get hurt, by you. Doo doo doo doo. Okay, so I reduce that by two. Yes, so he'll still hit, but he got a song out of it. Ahh! Miss! Fuck you! (laughter) Details, details. Okay, I turn to the orc who just missed me and I cast Dominate Person. With my-- through my Hand Cone of Clarity, of course. I command him to protect our goliath, with his life if he needs to, and retreat from me instantly. I will move a step towards Lyra. And I will just be backup for her, and I also will inspire her. With a little-- I turn to her, and I start singing. (sings) And I raise my hand to Lyra and say that you could use some Scanlan today. Tonight I give you a d10. (laughter) Never happened before. Trinket's doing something. And he dies. I've never heard of any of these things. What? Too much math. She's a guest. Nine. Nine. Wow. She just changed the game. To whom? Are they within 30 feet? 45. Wow, that was amazing! I turn around and sort of barf because I just saw a guy's upper half get incinerated. (laughter) My dominated guy is not going to live to see his-- Protect our goliath! Good job Percy. I sort of had that guy covered but it's all good. It's all good. Plus your persuasion. Plus two! Yeah! We got him! We can kill him in a second if we have to, so-- West. He's giving you sass. While they're talking, I'm going to loot the other bodies. Would you like to? No. Wait. Stop. Grog. You should have checked with our leader before you did that. All right. Are we doing a talk circle? You did kill one of them too, though. I could sing a song to make her feel better. At least she's not talking about Aldor, so I'm okay with it. I-- we should go. We've got another day's travel, it's got to be 20 miles away. Is it nighttime? Oh, let's go back to bed. You did your job. I'll take the next watch. It's the next day. We ride! Do we ever run out of that stuff? Wow. We don't have the carpet. Do we have the carpet? It's all right, we don't need the crutch. We're fine. Uh-huh. How did he react when you first told him of your feelings? Always works for me. Well, you-- men are complicated. Four. Hey, that adds up. What's that mean, what's that mean? What about you? I can't let you do that, Lyra. I feel-- I feel a connection, I do. You know when you were telling me about Aldor-- No-- I-- uh. Believe me, you sexually? You repulse me. Yeah, no, really. Oh yeah. I feel a connection too! I have had some Aldors in my life, too. Yes, mainly they were whores who kicked me out early. But they-- in a similar way they disrespected me, didn't see the true Scanlan that I could've been. Wait, together? You've been with him? I thought you meant that as a metaphor. Somehow you made that less sexual than I could've ever imagined. Is there-- Grog, what's the term for when your penis is inverted? The opposite of a boner? Yeah, that's what I've got now. You know men are fickle and when I-- I'll have a talk with him. Let's do it. Let's not dwell. I love her. Good leading, good leading. Which way, east, north, south? I don't even know what this is, what is this? 13. Can we get its attention? We've got this. But who knows what lurks in those woods? All right. Let's plunge in. What? What kind of devil are you? Wait, can you fly? We could, we just rented them. 50 bucks, so. Oh boy. Something out there. Nope. Your passive perception-- Wow. When the cameraman laughs. (sings) The more you know. Clang-clang-clang. 13. 13. Should we go check that glowing entity out? Okay. If you insist. You're delegating, that's good. Or one of us could climb it and-- -- bring it down as bait. I could do that. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. It was just a random meteor. What do we do, guys? We're in between two giants and a dragon? Do they break? Wow, that was amazing. Mary and Felicia are so good. So talented. You killed people and stuff. No no no no no. To what? Buggles? Many ones. They have portraits already? Whoa, awesome. Are they in the box of holding, there in the box? Somewhere. Oh my god. One Dwarf Too Many. One Dwarf Too Many. As read by Sir Ian McKellen. It's made of dice. Wow, for a fan of the Cowboys to get that, that's amazing! I am a fan of obscure Picasso art. And sketches. Maybe Hundertwasser sketches, or something. (laughter)
