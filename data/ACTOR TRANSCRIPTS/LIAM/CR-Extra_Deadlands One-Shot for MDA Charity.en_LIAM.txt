How did you get there so fast? Do we start out with one of each? Is that correct? They're also delicious. Matt, I would like to point out that the chat has typed the words "high noon" about 72,000 times in almost five minutes. Please don't break the universe. They are so layered, and have so much depth. Where do your ancestors hail from? Hi. My my name is Reverend Forrest Alton. I am from upstate New York, near the Canadian border. (laughter) We're going to be the best of friends. I don't know how to respond to that. Question, because I have trouble scrubbing Grog and you out of my mind, are you like a buck twenty? Guide my hand. Oh, one of each! Praise Jesus! I am the straight man, is what I am. Three blues, one two three. Wow. (singing) Sweet little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine. Oh, we're making rules for us? I don't even drink. How did that happen? Hey, Marshal? I don't know the rules really at all in this game, but I think I read somewhere that if I sin, I get negatives? So I don't know that I've sinned, but I might have sinned. I don't know. We've got to establish the rules before we blow them up, folks. Yes? I don't. I remember someone pouring something into my glass, I assumed it was lemonade. I need to take a walk and do a little thinking. See you later? Could I have a black coffee, please? You've had enough. Let's put this aside. You want to maybe get some fresh air? You seem troubled. Are you carrying a heavy load? I've seen many soldiers shell-shocked in war-- I give her her space. I'm a little nervous. Into her hair? He was behind your ear the whole time. (laughter) You fuckers. He does have a copy of "You're Never Weird On The Internet". I've been making my way through the bar and I'm sure there's some bloodied eyes and some teeth knocked out, so I'll administer what limited first aid I know. Okay. Okay. Okay, now. Two fives! I say, all right. I have some bandages here. No sudden movements, I just want to help you out. Trouble leads to trouble, friend. Well, it's funny. If you want to forego the physical, I do have a little know-how with the spiritual. Would you prefer we take it in that direction? I'm no man or woman's judge. I don't know her. I'm happy to help you. You seem like you need succor and aid, and I will give that to you. I wouldn't be too quick to judge her. That's-- the fuck is that? Six. Rub my hands together and lay them on the arm and say, "Our Father, who art in heaven--" And however this game works, because I don't know, I would like to heal him using-- Faith check, yeah. Oh my god, I never use 12s when we play D&D. I think it's not that one. It's this big round one, yeah. I'd like to use a chip. This is a trait check, right? What do I roll? Both again? Ten. I know. I questioned it at first as well. But the Lord provides. You can give in and no man will judge you. Be with God, all right? (laughter) What is his name? Yes. I definitely think I could provide aid to him. Is he poorly? Not that sorry. (laughter) Are we talking about an animal here, Sheriff? It's really getting to be a little rude. Really. Wait. It's a baby! Wait! We'll return it to the wild. It doesn't look like it can tear up a sack of flour! I'm going to crouch down and hold my hands out. Is that for her? For me. Come here, nugget. But bears? Follow the leads? Sheriff, can you point me towards your reverend, your ailing reverend? What's his name again? Oh, one-stop shopping, everybody. Abjurist Pissbucket Shitwalla. Is that a native word? Togo? The Sheriff pointed us there, didn't he? You have a man of the cloth here as well and I've come to help. In ways that you are not accustomed to. That's worse than you. Who's who here, doc? Doc, is this one worse off? Let me see him. At the very least, I can offer him the word of the Lord. Pick the shitty one. I place a hand on his head with the thumb right here, right at the temple. Reverend Smith. It's not your time. Give me a minute. I pray to the Lord. I will heal this man. Miracle. Okay, how many do I have, total? Ten. So I've used four. Oh, I've used four already? I still have to-- No, because my hindrance is heroic. So I can't divvy out. Yeah, I've got to, right now. So I have seven total, and I'm going now. Ten. So Liam is asking-- am I throwing dice? Yes, I'm going to pray harder. Wait, so I could use a chip to go higher than I already did? Oh, add a d6. Well, now I can see that I don't understand the rules, can I use this now to add a d6? One. Can I use another red chip? One. Just a one. So that gets it to 11. All right! DONATION See? Come on. I have to. Come back to me, Reverend, come back to me. All right! All right! Welcome back, Reverend. The Lord will abide. Please, don't thank me. Take him by the hands. We all find ourselves low and in place of trouble. It's always time to come back to his faith. Hallelujah. Man down! Wait, can I make a persuasion check on her? Yeah, I'd like to. Juniper. Technically, you do know me. Biblically. You don't want to go down that hole. I'm not good with comedy. This is very awkward. I just don't want to see you going over an edge you can't come back from. What do I roll to stop Laura Bailey from having drugs? Yeah, okay. Okay, all right, it's not the worst. (laughter) Yeah, so equal numbers. Dance-off. One, two, three. Listen, I'm going to give this to you. It's a bar of soap, it's my last one. Use it. It doesn't go in your mouth. You know what soap is, right? The video game developer? (laughter) Can I pray for guidance to know if this is a devil or an angel talking to me? I have to. I'll be screwed later, but I have to. Shit. Two and two, shit. Shit! Four. Here are two that I've used. You don't know the rules you learned yesterday? Dan, if you've got means here to boil some water and some whisky that you've got, I could probably help you out with your throat, if you like. A little background in medicine. Your choice. Dan, I've seen the brains pour out of a man's head on the field of battle on the Eastern coast. You can have my help if you want, or you can suffer. God bless, Dan. Protestant. I'm not really sure what you're asking? Are you asking me to babysit while you-- (hiccups) I suppose it is a little funny. (hiccups) We're all tested. Each in our own way. What? I know, I can-- never mind. I take a step in front of the gypsy. Dan. I'd like to reach my hand down to-- --Stinky Jules' revolver. No, not to take it, to cast Smite on it. Give her the ol' reach-around. Okay, I know I'm in front of her. Where's Stinky? He who? She? Do I need to touch the gun to-- oh, okay. Then I can't do that at all. She's five feet behind me. I'm backing up, I'm backing up. Relax, relax. Hand behind me. I brush my fingers across her gun and cast Smite. It's called the dick graze. What do I roll for this? Spirit, right? Faith. God damn it. Total of nine. You don't want to shoot an unarmed man, do you, Dan? You smell like cow plops. What just happened? Al invited the three of us? (Sudis voice) You're going to fuck a guy... (creaking sound) Is he faking it? Do you think he's from New Jersey? I swoop and I hook her on the arm and I just guide her out the door. Strong stuff you serve. Strong stuff. Come on, out the door you go. Understood, Dan. Thank you for your patience. Hockmanitou? I'm trying to figure it out. I heard you say "Da." Are you Russian? I'm going to take-- Come here, Mr. English, or wherever you're from. Right. Let's take ten minutes to take care of this. You want the pus? Where'd it go? I don't think you have it. I'm going to pull Stinky off into an alley for a second. Stinky. You know, I'm not a Sunday school child. I'm not a blushing flower. I understand how the world works. I don't need the money. So you can have my share. Helping this town is enough. But I do want to understand-- I realize you have a higher tolerance than I do. What happened last night? Okay. That was very candid. I know that's a fucking devil. People find comfort where they can. Do you have any whisky? Can I have it? No. Ever consider marriage? Hey, Marshal? You think I got two minutes for the bathroom before the shit hits the fan, here? Who is he? What's going on? I'm walking out to him and laying on hands. I know. Okay. I don't know. Okay, I'm going to use-- the reroll is the blue? 12. Put those innards back in, son. You're okay. All I ask is that you use your time more kindly and more wisely. How big a creature are we talking about, Charlie? Charlie. It's a gift from above. Don't waste it. He's a faker, yeah. Big surprise. Oh man, Jesus is displeased with you. I just fucking healed that guy. Hey, man, Liam's agnostic. I get you. Does he explode into a mist of blood? While he's doing that, question he dropped his accent for a second 20 minutes ago. But I don't catch that if the dice don't catch it, right? Can't trust the English, if we've learned anything. I pull out the sharpened crucifix I have. It's that way, and I just walk off. Welcome Vox Monica, I am Skizzbucket Tatertaint. (laughter) Why not? It's going to stick! It's the new hotness. Come on! (accented) That is a moon. Fail. (spits) Ugh. I don't know what happened last night. I have a lot of praying to do. I sneaked it. It's mine! (accented) Smart check. Is that a thing that we would all know about in this--? Is our trail cold here? Can we all make a tracking check? And then do we roll-- if you've got no skill in it, is it two d4s? Two! Yeah, whatever this thing is a scourge. Also, I don't understand. Are we saying that silver is a danger to these creatures? Is that what you're implying? Why would he have run into the middle of a silver mine? It doesn't make sense, if silver is a bane to these creatures it wouldn't have run right into the heart of it. I'm going to walk behind. (hiccups and spits) Chat loves a serial killer. Is there any hair coming out of that hand? Okay. Uh, no idea what that is. What do I roll? All right, three plus-- Thanks man. Five minus two is three. And I'm going to waste a blue. So that's a three plus two is five. I'll settle at five. Are you sure you don't want a poultice on that? It's really a simple thing for me to do, to wrap some mud and some water. Well, we have to make a choice. We either go in now, stop it from escaping, if it's our killer. Or go back for reinforcements. I take out my crucifix and lead the way. Are her bullets still smited? God damn it! I mean, God bless it! (laughter) You're asking me? 2d-- oh, that's the damage. Oh my god, that was your boob. Shuffle one more time. Hey, question, way earlier in the game, as I shuffle my cards, you said that I gained two miracle points back. It's been a while. Do I, or do I not? So, say that last bit again? Because I thought I was down to one, so if you're giving me one, now I have two? Oh Jesus, I don't know. I was marking it down and, before I asked you that question, I was at one point. I did a lot of shit, man! I thought it was two a miracle. I healed a couple of people. I smited her bullets. Three? So I'm at five now? Okay. I did not. I'm going to pull this one. I'm adding. Nine. I want to stab this thing with my crucifix. Okay, so-- oh, I do have skill in that. So it's a d4 and a d6? Okay. Four and a four, and I'm going to give you a red-- no, I'm going to use a blue chip and add to that for eight. You are not welcome here! I really admire you. (Sydney voice) There seems to be a railgun over here. Jeepers. Ease down. Ease down. It's dead. I'm going to bless her bullets. How did you do that? Right, but that thing you just killed, that's not what we were following. We need to press on. It's going to take me a couple of minutes. We can handle this peacefully! Stinky, put your gun down. And I bless her bullets. I'm going to add to that with a red, so it's six plus two is eight. This one's the good one on top. Five of clubs. Mediocre as hell. You're still skinny as fuck, though, right? (high-pitched battle cry) Opa, opa, opa. I had a five. You fucking smell like balls. They're blessed, they're blessed! Plus four to-- Plus four on the damage. DONATION That's what I said. I want to bless the crucifix that I'm holding and attack, which I can do, right? Does that work? So five is what I roll for that-- All right, eight on the faith. And then the attack is what gets gunked, right? Four minus two, plus four, so six for the stab to the eye. (hiccups) Uncanny Dodge. Bring us home, Marshal, bring us home. Thank you, Lord, for letting me sleep with two women and a man. (laughter) No shit. Wait, flames on my back? What? Thanks, chat! We call him Jesus, but. (laughter) Hey, there's one god, clearly one god, clearly. R-E-K-T, rekt. Where's the silver bullets? We don't got a smelting machine. Thank you for donating. Thank you.
