Wait wait wait, I've got some thing. I just gave everyone in the party rupees, treasure! These were sent to me by Tim West who has a great new company called Fantasy Coin HQ. If you go to fantasycoinhq.com he makes - Matt's holding up a dwarven coin at the moment - they make gems, they make fantasy coins, nerd coins. This is just a thank you! Check it out. Or if you just hit a really tall tuft of grass with a sword, these will pop out of it so you don't have to order them. Just mow your lawn. We circled all the way back around. We just barely survived the chat room and now we need to rest. We crashed down by the tunnel, we fled. We sealed up the way behind us, ran in. Well I recommend. We don't want to go up and through the camp again? So we're going to backtrack the way we came to that war camp road, yes? I’ll just follow. I thought I understood. We went out of there. And just to make sure that my memory is on point-- --Before we circled back around, we hit a fork in the road where we could have gone up and we could have gone down. So that's behind us. Cheers. (meh meh meh sounds) Do you even lift, bro? I would just like to point out that we're 9 adults playing don't touch the hot lava at the moment. (all laugh) Tiberius, I've seen that bottle a lot. What does it do? Oh! Thank you! That clears that up! (all laugh) Does it make a lot of water? Is that unlimited? First roll. Survival. Check out the brain on Brad! Yes. I was about to say I'd like to move ahead of the group a bit and start sneaking along. Do I have advantage like my sister had for-- No. All right, well-- 26 for me. 26. I've tiptoed away. 26. Still natural? Vax creeps back to Pike and ushers her up to the front. Do you recall any of the details from your vision, from your dreams? By the smaller-- --of two lava flows. From our vantage point can we see the two lava flows that we were warned about? Between the lava and the red stones, the twins can see, correct? Because of the dim light. Right, right, right. Yes. It quiets your parts. We need to get closer up. We need to find this trap door, because it's suicide going in the front. The twins will creep - continue ahead. 25. Dtdtdt! Yes, let's go look. Let's go catch one. Vex. Why don't we go just up ahead and scout? Perception check. 26. I already perceived it. What is he saying? Good job, dummy. Quickly. That'll be the fortress, maybe, but-- I’m so bored. Let's go check it out. Just eat your banana, the twins will go check it out. The twins are gonna go have a peek. You dick! You just stopped him from farting into his flute. That's a 1 face. (all laugh) Yes, d20. Uh, that's a half a d20. Fuck. I'm going to see if I can see anything in the area that has done this recently. Investigation check? 7. Clever. There you go. Oh, I can get advantage? I'm picking up one of the arms-- --to bring back to the group. Not pretty. (gagging sounds) This is the work of a beaver. It happened in the past. It's a human centipede. Human? Human footprints? Human sized. I don't think we want to tangle with this. What are we trying to prove? Let's just keep trucking. Also, put the accordion back in the bag, all right? Yeah, we're going to go back to the group, I'm going to bring the arm. When we get back to the group, I'm going to toss the arm to Grog. It's a back scratcher. If we have to, we will, but-- Spike coated in dried blood. No, we should just keep going. If we're going to run into it, we're going to run into it. Let's not find it. That was the most adorable diss in history. (all laugh) You lose an inspiration die. (all laugh) Okay, twins in front, here we go. Percy! Don't bang the guns together. We all have plus 10? 32. Can I see him now that she's pointed him out to me? It doesn't seem to be moving, though. Maybe it's a statue. No! I don’t! Good job, gnome nuts. We faced basilisks once and they did this to Vex'ahlia. That's crazy. Why do you suppose they used it on one of their own? So it's a duergar pet? Don't look at them. That's correct. Yes, that's it. It's a vision thing. All right. It's a good thing we've all been watching Daredevil last week. We sprinkled some of its blood on your eyes, if I remember correctly. You did. I was very sad. We also don't know if it's a basilisk. No, it's heavy. All right, creeping back. The creeps are creeping. We're in stealth, still, or...? 26. Oh. Well, I said I wanted to go back and look. Right, I want to see if I can tell if anything - I know this all looks natural, but perhaps something is fashioned to look such. I want to see if I can figure that out. Uh, lalalala. 18. All right. I double back for the Underdark expert and I bring my sister up. See if you can find a false door or something. Do it. Do it. No! It was a 1. All right. That's not a 1. Yes. That sounds kind of noisy. Yeah, I'm thinking that Keyleth should-- --bird out and drop me. She can get a hit or two, but the chances that she could take them both out at once... Dave, the illithids have it. Thank you, Dave. Oh my god, her mouth opens up and tentacles come out and - Wait, can we see anyone else? Can I see duergar from any other perch? No? All right. This seems dangerous and reckless. Let's do it? Who gives a shit? Or fall in the lava. You just gotta shove them. I'm hanging by Keyleth in case shit goes south. Then we're going up, right? Yeah, girl. The ocean has changed you. Are they carpeting up? How are you going up? Scanlan, how are you guys going up? Eagle? Carpet? What? Do it, Tom Cruise. Portal, motherfucker! But a quiet Thunderwave, right? (singing) This is a triumph. We're total fake geeks, all of us. (all laugh) Wilhelm scream! Friendzoned. Come on, Grog. I’m going to get some duergar! I use pushing attack! Two and a half years in and Keyleth has just learned our names. I’m Vex, okay? It’s simple! (singing) He had it coming, he had it coming. You just one-upped Grog, man. Turn into a duergar! (cawing sounds) Tiberius, fly up there quick. Stop eating chicken and fly up to that door. There's a magic doorway up there, I don't see any handles or anything. Oh, it’s on the ground? I walk up to it and take a look. Do I have advantage? All right, take a look, dude. Keyleth! Let's go up! Up to them, quick. That’s going to be about 6 seconds. 65? Holy shit you're a deity! (gunshot sound) You got me right in the ear. I’m getting my picks out, seeing if I can figure out some way to-- 29. So this is the part where I ask Grog over to pull. Grog, grab this-- We can't leave this duergar behind though, we gotta take him out. It was a good idea though. Remember it for the future though. Yes, he's going to run and tell people. Come on, 20. It's a 1. You almost shot me! Redemption, Percy. Right in the belly button. Just barely. It's like Winnie the Pooh, in the-- Feels like an intermission room. Yes. We could all relieve ourselves in this room. That's your favored terrain, right? Zac matches the construction paper. Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Singorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn’t last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (dragon roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough, (ringing weapons SFX) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference. Holy hell. It's so handsome. Come on. Yes, they want them. I agree. Yes, I'm going to sniff the door a bit. Yeah, that's a 20. Okay, well - (clinking SFX) Okay, thieves’ tools out. Oh, that's an easy 30. 30. It's, uh, Ermahgerd? I'm picking a lock. (clicking SFX) ‘Ey! It was pretty easy. Where is the door? Where is the door that I just picked? It's naturally there. I'm going to take six or seven quiet steps forward, stealthily. 19 stealth. Just circulate it around the room, will you? All right, I'm having a peeky-poo. Do I hear anything? Yes. That's pretty good. 27. Go figure. I go back to the door and just be like-- So, I want to go further - no doorway, as of yet. Correct? If I go this way-- Well then, I'm going to peek into this door here. This open door. No. What's right by the figure? Thank you, thank you. So, down the one hall. Down. Right, I don't even tell anyone. I just start to slink down the steps. Yes. Right and left? I go to the right. You should just storm in. Start banging your weapons together. And that's when I went to the right? I'm going to turn my chin over to the left, and see what I see down there. Yeah, I'm going to go kill this guy. (softly) Uh, I'm killing someone. Hold, please. (all laughing) I'm going to sneak up on this duergar. 19? Like a magician, you just whip it out, Matt. He's right there on the side. There's one over there, there's one over there. There's two. Oh, shit. Well, we all come slamming down in here. So I sneak back up and I put a hand on my sister's shoulder, and I give her a little come along motion. And tell everyone else-- --I mouth "Kima" at everybody, and then pull my sister down. I'm just pulling Vex down. So I pull my poison blade out and I pull the keen dagger out. Okay, and I take the keen dagger - so the one on the left is by the door and the one that muttered through the doorway, right? So I give a little fwip, toss in my hand and throw it right at his neck. And the other one, the poison one, toward the other. That guy. That is a 17 for me. And then on the other guy, or should I just go ahead and attack? 17. So that’s-- So, 46 with the keen dagger on the guard at the door. It’s like a punctuation. LAURA & The poison dagger goes (thunk sound). Well, I didn’t roll to hit him. Yes. That is a 19. This doesn’t get sneak attack? Because I already used that. I made some noise hitting the first guy. 7 plus the poison. The poison is DC 15. 9 points of poison on him. Do we roll for initiative at this point? Careful, clanky. 28. I start to loot the bodies. Yes. (clanking SFX) Surprise! Lady Kima? Yes, I was about to say. I'm going to go start inspecting the other door. Oh, sorry. I pull my sister and we flank. I push her into flanking position to the door. The stairs, from where we entered? Vax is scooching Scanlan out of the way to take that position right there. Yeah, someone's coming. One moment. It is now not locked, I think. 25? No, it's a trap ready to hit me. That hits. Didn't check for traps. I'm going to use uncanny dodge. Right, I spit on the ground, and yank my belt off and throw it at his head. Yeah, serpent. Okay, 12 plus, I don't know what, 12. Is my attack, his attack, snake attack? Yeah. All right. What I like is that there are 8 of us and 1 of him. I can see the square, it's very small. 20. (shooting SFX) Okay. All I'm gonna do is grab the hole of the door and yank it open and yell, “Your turn, Grog!” I use my bonus action to say, “You are so fucked, dwarf.” (all laugh) That's the best line of the night! (laughs) Oh, murdering children again. Holy cow! That was Greyspine's cousin. Everybody give up your turn to Grog. Instant karma's going to get you, man. You hear that, Keyleth? Vax is using his free hand to cover his eyes. You're going to pull through, buddy. Pike! We need Pike in here! 5, 1. Pike, roll well. The twins fucked it. Scanlan! Come up here! She's not in her right mind. Insight to see if she's in her right mind. I'm pulling out my lockpicks and I'm going to start working on-- And you know my lockpick snaps so... just totally broken. Grog, the locking mechanism on this is jammed. Ease down! Ease down. Allura has sent us. Time 'til what? It's magical, it'll fit you. The armor that I found and gave to Grog. It's magical. Yes. Lady Kima, are these things absolutely necessary? We have a secret entrance to this place. We could leave now. Are they of vital importance, the things you've lost? Well, that's that then. Let's go to the vault! Let's go upstairs. She's a ripped halfling. She's the Tyler Durden of halflings. (all laugh) I think Grog is smitten! Oh my goodness! Is provolone all you've got? I place a hand on Lady Kima’s shoulder-- --place a hand on Kima's shoulder and say, “Please, allow me,” and move several feet ahead of her and start sneaking along. I'm right at her shoulder, so I say, “We understand he's dangerous, but he's gotten us this far.” He has been shit out by these creatures. They do not want him or trust him. He is an outcast. And we are working together, in this moment, and without him we would not have gotten here. Get it on, Tiberius! Get. It. On. Oh. Get it off? Clarota! Clarota! Speak your mind! Convince her. Fix this. Giving us a Walking Dead decision. I walk between them and put hands out. And say, “We all want the same thing. “Kima. Tell us. What is it that you've come here for? “What is your purpose here? Speak your mind, if you are true.” Clarota, why have you come here. What is it you seek? Then the two of you. Get over your fucking shit. (all laugh) You could be sitting in a cell by yourself doing fuck-all, or ending this problem now. I rolled a 13. Plus 13? 3 plus 13? Okay. Once we murder this K'Varn, you guys are going to laugh so hard. LAURA & The enemy of my enemy... We're playing a game of chess here, Kima, and we will win. So the building is empty. There's ghouls everywhere. I don't know. Undecided, I don't know. She can hump your leg. She's a ropy, muscular, halfling. What's it for?! (all laugh) Who's your deity? Harvey Keitel? (More laughing) A Milli Vanilli album, and...
