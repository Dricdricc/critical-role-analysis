I can't remember is Lady Kima with us at this point? Is she unstoned? And we said that we had it somewhere safe, but weren't we playing coy with that? I think we're getting feedback. Good morning sleepyhead. Yes you've just come down the stairs. We are the coolest. Not you, you've apparently been globe shopping. Chime in, please. One of us, one of us. From the treasury. I feel good about her being at this meeting. So I just start walking off towards Allura's tower. I look over at Tiberius and just short of sheepishly shrug. Friends! Friends! Don't mug yourself. Come correct. Don't mug yourself. I'd like to make a perfunctory insight check just to see if there's anything hinky. Okay. Yeah, everything's probably fine. That's an 18. (coughs) He pulled out the bag. She's working for the Illuminati and we're basically the A-team, so I think she might know a little better. Yes, but Orcus was behind the beholder. We killed K'varn and then he got back up again. He didn't get himself back up. I just worry that it's not just an appliance. It's got hidden in it something -- --is what I'm saying. Yeah. Just a ten. Yeah, I think so too. You're awfully quiet. He'll text you. Roll high. Eleventy-seven. Which person at the table, sis? Your brother? Why you gotta be like that, huh? Right in the ear. She's saying a ship will be ready in two days or take two days to travel? This is Allura and Kima who are here? I take Pike by the hand and I walk over to Kima. And they're short so I kneel down. I say to the both of them. Don't make me take my earrings off. I'm following Percy. There he is. (all cheer) My sister winks. I'm scanning the entire store for him. I want to find him. Oh! He's not here? All right. Let's make my hair even glossier than it already is. I know that thumb. Is there a front desk? Is there a front desk? I'm sorry, he's looking for Gilmore. They're going to flirt together. Sorry. Okay, and there's a person manning the -- Is there a bell or anything? Yeah. Will you remind me because it's been a while. Gilmore's a good-looking man, though, isn't he? Yeah. I'm picturing Jeremy Irons in a wizard robe. Okay. I feel you. You ruined it for me, man! I lean in. I lean in. I pat him on the hand. I look to my sister as we go. And stroll out the door with Gilmore. Have at it, ladies and gentlemen. Vex hasn't had a chance to haggle since the show started. All she used to do before this show was haggle. But in the heat of the moment. A stone Grog in the middle of a fight? Money is meant for spending. Not that I’m here. One month ago you needed that. It’s an abacus. Uh. I got it. This is so period. It’s just like Lord of the Rings. Beep beep beep. God damn it! All right, well I’m not here anyway, so I’m just gonna keep doing this, as you were. Everyone hears from the back, Scanlan’s voice piping up saying, "Just buy all this shit!" Thirty... thirty-ish. I mean, I’m not here, but -- So maybe we could open up a line -- I’m sure you guys could open up a line of credit with my buddy Gilmore. Yeah, an I.O.U. Once we’re back from our day. In our possession now. Thirty-one. She’s trying, she’s trying, it’s coming up on my phone. That oil from the Wizard of Oz. Get the dragon armor out. Five hundred thousand gold right there. I’m gonna tell them. Oh my gosh. You have to make a persuasion roll, quick. Ten. Ten, they rolled a ten. Get it out out. I like that the 400,000 people who saw that thing are tuning in to the shopping episode. TALIESIN AND We’ve been fighting and killing for weeks, Wait, DM, where am I with Gilmore? In-between time. In-between time. And I place my hand on his hand. And I give it just a little squeeze. I pat him on the back, I do a little circle with my hand. Where we at, girl? This is finances, this sounds like a married couple. Did we get that from the dragon, where did we get that? I’ll never forget the rage-looting. I’ll never forget the rage-looting. Vax looks at Gilmore and just shakes his head. Cheers to that. But Grog’s got it. But where is it? He doesn’t have the info. And because he doesn’t have the sheet -- --and he can’t read the exact amount? I thought it was a 100,000. Oh, 150. Okay. in the fucking world. No, we’ve got you. We’re losing our audience. Ring it up. You guys are a black screen, what happened? All right, we hear you. There you are! I take him by the hand, do one of these clasps, and say, The world is full of money, Vex'halia. No, clerics can't use swords. It used to be just blunt weapons for clerics, wasn't it? We were so glad to have you, sister! Worth it.
