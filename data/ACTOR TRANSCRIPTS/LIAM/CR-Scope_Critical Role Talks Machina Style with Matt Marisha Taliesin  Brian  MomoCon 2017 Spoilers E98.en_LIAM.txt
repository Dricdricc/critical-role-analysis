Hey, guys. It's William, it's been a while since I've seen you. Start off with a fun question from the last episode. There were a lot of people in chat debating how that fight was going to go, and who was going to come out on top. Going into it, who did you guys think was going to win, and what were some abilities or items that you were thinking might come up that didn't? Talks Machina is usually about the last episode. And the second half of that, were there any abilities or items that you were thinking might come up that didn't in the fight? Thank you. Matt, you have a perpetual standing offer-- You have a perpetual standing offer anytime I'm at a panel, if you want to use Frostmourne as a prop or to kill Brian Foster, you're welcome to ask. Frostmourne is always waiting.
