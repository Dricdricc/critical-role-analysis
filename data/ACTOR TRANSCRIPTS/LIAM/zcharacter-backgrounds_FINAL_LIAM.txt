Never entirely welcome in the company of  elves or men, Vax'ildan learned  at a young age to skip past formality,  preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia,  Vax was born by a chance encounter between Elven  royalty and Human peasantry.  Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins  were eventually sent off to their father  in the Elven capital of Singorn.  But their cool reception among the Elves there never warmed,  and their time in the capital didn’t last.  The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on  the open road.  After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to  return to their mother, and journeyed  back to the lands of their youth.  But instead of finding their childhood home,  they returned to a pile of rubble.  Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.  Pressing the townspeople for answers,  they learned of the day the dragon came. With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister  set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.  An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s  challenges in his own particular way,  often by sidestepping them entirely.  And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough,  the way of blades the elves schooled him in  more than makes up the difference.
