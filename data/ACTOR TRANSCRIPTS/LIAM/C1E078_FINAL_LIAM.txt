You should totally play that during the Thordak fight. 12 hours of wings, Matt? Thank you! You have chosen poorly. No wonder you're in voiceover! He's a good human being. He said, he said, Mark said, he's got to die. He's got to die, Matt, he's got to die. It was so good, it was so good! I did, I liked it. Well, that's part of it, but the whole thing was pretty good! You are on a show called Critical Role, where a group of nerdy-ass voice actors-- Oh, I just got the Christmas spirit all up in my heart. Nice. Sam will listen to it in five months. This is a fine-ass baseball cap. On the inside it says How Do You Want To Do This? Oh, and your head is so small, and my head is so large. How long is the trip, did we say? To get to Emon from here. Then we're meeting with Dad? I think that's our way, yeah. I feel like we want to catch up with our father's army before they're anywhere near the walls of the city, because, well, that'd be stupid. We could find a jeweller right now. If that's what you're into. Kynan? Kynan! Emon. To Emon. That's a metaphor for Vox Machina. Dad creates a shit-storm at the wall, and we take advantage of that chaos. How long did we say before Syldor reaches Emon? Dusk the following day. And you said afternoon right now? So a little more than 24 hours. They can hate us, and we can deal with that afterward, if there is even an afterward. Also, somewhere in all this fracas, we need you to take care of us with food. Right, when is the time? In the keep, for old time's sake? I mean underneath. There's no guarantees, Scanlan. We're going to hell. Where do you think we're going? It's going to be fucking awful. You're probably going to be dead in 48 hours. You're adorable. It was chaos when we left. We fought Vorugal and then high-tailed it out of there; inside and gone. Still standing? There wasn't anybody around it? That's as close to a guarantee as we're going to get. You are. That guy is a badass motherfucker, and we do want him. Well, he's got those brown eyes. It's called gallows humor. I'll go find Shaun, after her. Scanlan, do you need a little resolve for this fight? There's no other reason? Still no other reason? Solid. You do that. Percy, spend it all. You don't have any guests over there. Heroin? That's for after the dragon. Spend everything right now. Two electrum. Can I steal you for a second? Over here. Hi, again. Remember how we just saw each other a couple of days ago, and I tried to say goodbye, and you told me to promise you that I would see you again? You know what would help with that? Boy, have I got an offer for you. You want to help us save the world? My family and I, we're going to him. And I wasn't sure the path that would take us there. I thought we might be on our own. But we're back here. And you are easily the most impressive arcane user I've ever met in my life. And I want us all to still be breathing in a week. I can't think of anyone better to stand with us than you, Shaun. I grasp him by the back of the head. Gesundheit. I'm so glad to have you with us, friend. So glad. It will be a little bit easier now. Good time for a musical quote. I'm sure it will be glorious. Let's do it. Holy shit, man! This is too bad, I can't wield this fucker. I could use this because it's dex-based, if I so choose? One attack, but not-- I can't do longsword and then a dagger? Yes. But it's attunement, so I have to choose something. This would supersede Whisper. Yeah. I understand that, but this is very strong, and with wings I could go anywhere. You're allowing it? You're allowing it? Okay. So it's light. You have a potion of haste, yeah? What if you gave me that and I gave you my boots? It's up to you. I don't want to-- You take the boots, I'm on the potion. I have Whisper and this sword. We either go with the shitty hand we've been given, or we lie down and let him steamroll over us. It's the same thing. And all together is 2,000? He has been training military in Whitestone. And they can get themselves here quick, like you? We also supposedly have a green dragon as an ally. That was catty. No that's good. That's good. Pretty good. What happened to the wind? I have my hand on her back and I just start-- That explains so much. (laughter) 22. I spin her around and tilt her head back. What's that? Do you know what that is? Is that normal? Whoa, that's nifty! Hi! A flare, we have flares. Kiki, we have flares. You're not alone, there is an army of elves marching as we speak. A great many people are grateful for your aid, as am I. You're a good man. I just nod my head. That is fucking cool. We should get out of here. Allura? It was so weird though, you were standing directly behind him. (laughter) I catch her by the arm. I can't wait to come back. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go, please! (laughter) Drink the Courage one now. You can't always be in control, Percy. Why is the music so-- Is he here now? That your brother gave to you. That's smarter. That's wise. I'm attuning the dragon sword, and I want to use it a little bit just so I don't get pantsed in the moment. Does it work all right; am I all right with this? It's awfully large. Yeah. I mean, I'd like to, but do we have time? Yeah, sure. What? Nothing. What were you going to say? For what? It's really the same thing, at all times. I poke him in the knee with my sword. (laughter) That is-- Is this a sneak attack? No, it's just 28. I jump back five feet. (laughter) Evasion! (calls) We're really not that far away! Are we going to do this? You ready? Me. Are we doing initiative or attacks? I don't even know what this is? Oh, man, what are we fighting to? Here we go. So that is the first and that is-- I'm going to use Luck. I spent it already. Just so we're clear, everybody-- I'm going to switch back to Liam-- This is a game! This is a game. Which camera's on me? This is a game! So it's an 18. That's the first one. Natural 20, with Whisper. Thank you. So what is he at? Nope. Oh, that definitely hits. Oh, you do have two different color eyes. They're so nice. All right, we'll play slap and tickle later. Anyway, sword works. Sure. What'd you need it for? I have a shortsword, but that sounds better. Full Bollywood. Yeah. Are we going to talk to what's-her-butt? Buddy! Where have you been!? I've been fucking worried sick! You were there; you were gone. How'd you even get back here? Listen, I'm fucking with you. All right? What's up, green bean? It's a maze in there. But the tunnel from our keep in, if it's intact, was not that far. I mean, what kind of symbol do we send up in a sky full of wyverns? Well, let's go. Are there clouds overhead now? Above the city. And if the skies are clear, they'll not be clear. And we're walking and we're walking and we're walking. And that's plus ten, right? 35, now. I rolled double ones. (wheezing) I move in, forward. I'm going to poke my head in first. 27. So far so good. I'm going to move further in. And continue to-- I'm going to check for traps. Fine, sure, investigation is an 18. Like, the whole place? So all the way up the stairs, to our bedrooms, to his laboratory, all that's clear? This single scoop tastes funny. I'm going downstairs to the entrance, and I'm going to check it out. And use Divine Sense at the entrance. All right. That's good. That is a 24. Feathers are in place? Nothing hinky with it? Well, why don't everybody bunch up for a second then? Superior, please. I'm weak as fuck. Grog, if we give it to you now, you can't drink it now. Not now. You have to wait. I didn't wanna-- I'm gonna get up in his shit. I just wanted you to be able to pl-- excuse me? Can I have that, Grog? Can I have that, please? He's holding a wood chip. I'm gonna, yes, I'm gonna peek through the pooper first. Let's see what I see. Yeah. Okay, that's fine. I'm just looking for anything unexpected, 27. Are there poos? It's clear. Invisible, please. I'm busy with other things. Also, it's maybe time for another Feast? Isn't it? It's about sundown. When we did it last-- We did it before beddie-bye. We cannot fucking fight Thordak without a Heroes' Feast. Three or four hours-ish. Only if it says it. Does it say it? A little lizard person. Can't see us, motherfucker! I am. I'm checking for traps, just in case. Natural 20. It's brand new. I lick it. There's nothing; it tastes clean. All right. Is it locked? Yeah, I'll roll out of there. It seemed like you had a little story you wanted to tell. Yeah, I roll out of there. How far down, with darkvision? I spank him on the ass and say I'm going in, follow me. I drop in. On tiptoes. Standing on his knee. I'm 40 feet ahead the whole time. 22. Hold on. Vex. In one location? Listen with me. Do we pop out now and talk to them? Wait if I go? Wait. I used to be one of you. I used to be Clasp. So fucking meta. (laughter) She's in the game. It's a ruse. Also one. "Cacaw, look over here!" I'm running after them. I shout out after them, I know Garthok, he'll recognize me! Don't care. Okay. Okay. I want to move to that door. Are they catching up behind? I'm checking the door, too. I rolled a 28. I'm not talking to Matt, I'm-- (laughter) Don't touch me! 28! Support you left and right, and this is the thanks I get? Scanlan. Will you come up here, please? I've got my hand on my earlobe for a fucking reason. I need you to talk us into this fucking doorway. Talk to the fuckers on the other side of this door. You can talk to anybody. They're straight-edge, I know. I use Thieves' Cant to knock out the phrase, "No bullshit," on the door. Where is Shenn? Where is he? 33. Perception check. For anything nearby. 29. No, you've got to get 30, right? What's between us and them? How far are they from us right now? I pull Vex out of view-- I know, I don't want to be heard. We've got two fucking giants up here, guarding our path-- Three of us are invisible, but not the rest. How do we get by? Extend the tunnel? But nobody's invisible but ourselves. And that's dropped at this point? Yeah? What's that? All right, cutie. Are you brooming it? I'm holding onto the broom. 31. (in Grog's voice) Surprise, gents! Would Evasion work for this? That's a dex save. All right, it's just 20 with me. How far are the twins from the giant? Right through? 21. So 21 hits? Okay, so the first one was-- All the dice, all the dice. 36 for my first, and eight for my second. Totally minor, I didn't add my regular bonus for dex and all that, so add another eight to my damage. Double-fisting them, gulp gulp! Merry deathmas, everyone. (singing) Here comes Cinder Claus, here comes Cinder Claus, right down Cinder Claus Lane! We need Brian Blessed now!
