Spice Girls. 000153.955 --> 000155.480 I'm working hard, buddy. 000415.499 --> 000422.750 You didn't dominate? 000534.117 --> 000535.847 I bet you guys clock in at like just below average-- 000650.173 --> 000654.738 That took a dark turn. 000710.568 --> 000715.051 So good! 001015.635 --> 001020.927 No, they don't want to see it. We should just get to the game, right? 001140.482 --> 001141.899 Roll it again! 001143.393 --> 001146.999 It's the only thing I'm here for. 001339.891 --> 001349.019 Does that mean that Logic was the whale that just passed us by? 001816.116 --> 001817.011 I am going to summon Frumpkin to my shoulder and look through Frumpkin's eyes because Frumpkin, 002034.979 --> 002038.783 as an octopus, has darkvision. So I will see that way. 002038.783 --> 002040.768 Oh, not so good. That's his? Just a seven. 002048.376 --> 002052.182 I could send Frumpkin in ahead of us to have a look around, if you think that's wise. 002400.646 --> 002402.700 Yes, it is. 002405.132 --> 002405.760 <i>Ja</i>, that's no problem. I give a little tug to the leather tied at my knee and cast Mage 002826.878 --> 002832.919 Armor. I send Frumpkin in, and reach for Nott, and hold Nott by the shoulder. Look through Frumpkin's 002832.919 --> 002835.694 eyes and send him in to look. 002835.694 --> 002844.286 Terrible. Just terrible. Five. 002856.074 --> 002902.554 Fjord, do you think it is safe to send in some light with him? 002920.970 --> 002922.583 Tap me on the shoulder if you hear me because I cannot hear you. 002925.360 --> 002926.519 (gutturally) Node. 002943.457 --> 002945.398 My spell books are in there, so please-- I can't hear anything. 003001.168 --> 003005.607 I am bowling ball sending one globule of light in after Frumpkin to go with him. 003010.566 --> 003016.928 It's mucky and dark in there. We would have to take a closer look; I cannot make out much. 003137.049 --> 003142.448 We're Ed Harris now. 003226.026 --> 003233.147 She's giving you your pills. 003544.181 --> 003548.398 Is one the same as another? 003829.136 --> 003830.844 She already has them. 003837.384 --> 003840.902 In the ocean? Let's take-- 003941.877 --> 003946.074 Yeah, I schloof Frumpkin to the back of Caduceus' head. 003958.503 --> 004000.188 While they're debating I spit out four globules of light and start casing the room. 004041.066 --> 004041.829 21 on investigation. 004124.802 --> 004125.435 The books are basically mud at this point, correct? 004244.060 --> 004251.264 It could also be someone who was having dreams, Fjord. 004510.618 --> 004512.775 If we are in a group, they are. They were around the group. 004605.161 --> 004606.707 Take your pills, Travis. Take your pills. 004611.657 --> 004613.104 How about a high roll? Nope. 004719.426 --> 004723.690 (singing) Caleb takes the rear. 004800.756 --> 004804.096 <i>Sechs</i>. 004933.957 --> 004935.169 Cocked. 005352.955 --> 005356.300 It was cocked. 005358.087 --> 005358.849 There's too much awesome in one spot. 005751.935 --> 005753.386 I-- shite-- take it. 010024.885 --> 010028.222 There's nothing to do about it. 010029.985 --> 010033.895 I'm good at those. 010035.368 --> 010037.470 That's a six. 010042.929 --> 010048.095 How much did I get harpooned for? 11? Was it 11? 010051.743 --> 010052.642 It lightninged us. 010126.661 --> 010128.095 Shield. 010153.920 --> 010202.259 I've abandoned my son! 010259.121 --> 010303.124 So those two are incapacitated in this second, right? 010507.240 --> 010508.612 The one on top is not? 010510.098 --> 010512.436 Okay. Well then, I will cast Slow on the shallow priest and the one that's laughing in front 010523.973 --> 010525.974 of me as well as I back away. 010525.974 --> 010527.735 Slowness. 010531.687 --> 010533.858 Hurts their AC. It's a wisdom saving of 16. 010539.175 --> 010549.895 So shallow priest's AC is down by two, disadvantage on dex saves, and he can only do an 010602.200 --> 010604.336 action or a bonus, not both. 010604.336 --> 010609.752 I back away half my speed towards where everybody is in the boat. I move behind my goblin <i>Freund</i>. 010621.639 --> 010625.719 (gurgling) Okay. Pretty good. 010641.229 --> 010646.129 Negative two to his AC. 011228.888 --> 011233.097 Does it get a multiattack, or does it just get one attack? 011459.853 --> 011502.089 It's a single attack. 011503.015 --> 011506.052 Its speed is halved. 011601.441 --> 011608.225 Make a save. 011612.774 --> 011615.103 Let him! Let her. 012025.467 --> 012027.305 From where I'm standing, I see Nott firing drunkenly up at an angle. I'm going to move 012144.460 --> 012150.054 forward, and peek up in the direction that she is looking, and see the shallow king, and say <i>Fick</i> 012150.054 --> 012152.938 <i>das!</i>. I will cast Magic Missile at level three. 012152.938 --> 012154.016 No, it's <i>fick das</i>. 012157.312 --> 012159.965 A total of 19. 012217.626 --> 012222.193 The five of the Magic Missiles will spiral around Fish Dick's head and come in at a different 012234.893 --> 012237.292 angle, and five of them go (impacts). 012237.292 --> 012243.288 I will step back in five feet. 012312.891 --> 012317.499 All right, let's treat this situation with the seriousness it demands. I douse the lights and 012603.191 --> 012609.268 bring Frumpkin down onto my own head like a mask, so I can see through Frumpkin vision. 012609.268 --> 012613.330 Like a Zorro mask with Frumpkin's beak right there. 012619.074 --> 012627.592 Little Zemnian man who's like Can't believe I didn't think of this sooner! 012630.977 --> 012638.243 No, <i>ein bisschen</i>. 012707.461 --> 012709.534 Yes. 012919.104 --> 012921.780 19. 012935.805 --> 012937.076 I would. 013245.092 --> 013251.760 Maybe bioluminescent, just like an underwater creature. 013305.761 --> 013307.754 I'll be with Nott. 013347.022 --> 013351.587 Caleb and Nott are together. 013415.701 --> 013419.055 It is like the beginning of the campaign. 013422.345 --> 013423.433 Yeah. 013617.711 --> 013621.870 Okay, so I can do that. I will send Frumpkin low along the bottom in the direction of this 013630.331 --> 013631.401 thing, stealthily. 013631.401 --> 013633.461 Ooh, let's take a looky-loo for the moment. 013636.350 --> 013644.224 But I did see where this flashing source was? 013752.572 --> 013753.905 Occasional, okay. So it's not like there was a creature that Frumpkin and I were able to aim 013758.044 --> 013800.695 towards, it was just this thing that was appearing and disappearing? 013800.695 --> 013804.945 Yeah. 013811.497 --> 013818.460 So we're connecting those two groups? 013845.605 --> 013846.409 We're spread out a little. 013847.594 --> 013848.385 Frumpkin will piss out some ink and use a bonus action to dash back towards the group. 013917.697 --> 013923.389 I tell him to come back and come out and say There's a lot of things just ahead of us over 013931.517 --> 013933.046 the ridge. 013933.046 --> 013934.735 Flashing, moving things, things that are alive. 013937.900 --> 013938.943 More than one, I think. 013940.918 --> 013942.097 I think so. 013945.123 --> 013946.582 Or something large with many parts, but I could not tell too well. 013950.764 --> 013952.737 I could not tell you. 013955.787 --> 013958.623 No, it's murky down here. 014002.074 --> 014006.633 I am reaffixing Frumpkin to my face. 014053.440 --> 014055.316 But maybe-- 014106.607 --> 014108.771 Just you two, right? Is this the group? 014225.373 --> 014230.229 Okay. 014234.154 --> 014238.577 So the ground is littered with coins outside of this? 014336.055 --> 014341.159 It will also put it at alert even before we get there. You send it in and it sees this other 014457.324 --> 014459.531 Jester and then it is ready for a fight. 014459.531 --> 014506.605 Well-- 014532.339 --> 014539.352 We're on this ridge. 014542.826 --> 014547.533 What do we see to the sides and-- so there's a cavern straight ahead facing towards us? 014555.163 --> 014559.576 That is my point. I think we quietly go around and get on top of the house and throw 014613.860 --> 014618.267 whatever the bait is in front and then we're back here for whatever comes out. 014618.267 --> 014619.496 Take our time. 014635.354 --> 014639.984 Sitting on top of it. 014646.109 --> 014650.242 You just turned 12 years old. 014810.579 --> 014812.559 Yes, DM. 014828.451 --> 014830.905 Shitty rolls at this table. 014956.917 --> 015004.568 I'm going to keep an eye on our rear. 015203.593 --> 015208.357 That's all the show is now. That's the rest of the campaign. 021342.226 --> 021352.370 The hell is wrong with us tonight? 021459.165 --> 021500.373 What on earth are we doing? 021824.169 --> 021826.081 Mine is functional! 021835.043 --> 021838.878 I am not. What are we doing? 022236.461 --> 022238.330 Let's go to the right, then. 022239.632 --> 022242.230 Yes, please. 022645.469 --> 022652.771 Or do. 022736.554 --> 022739.556 Wait, it's drawing towards us, or it's pulling in? 022815.117 --> 022820.328 Oh jeez, it jumped up. Well that's a six. Seven. 022852.129 --> 022900.804 Mm-hmm. 022921.143 --> 022928.399 I'm poisoned? 023018.678 --> 023022.445 I'm feeling a little weary. Does anyone want to help me out a little bit? 023227.615 --> 023230.945 Yeah, teamwork. 023236.038 --> 023237.613 What happened just now? 023249.977 --> 023251.751 Okay. 023252.577 --> 023255.080 No. 023255.731 --> 023256.814 I didn't know that was for me. 023258.029 --> 023300.413 Can't do the math right now. 023306.464 --> 023307.054 Then I'm good. 023308.564 --> 023310.867 I thought that was for one person. 023313.461 --> 023315.514 I can light it up in here if we want. Or do we want to? 023354.377 --> 023357.378 <i>Ja</i>? 023401.155 --> 023402.613 All right. I'm going to put the string of globules up the passage. 023406.374 --> 023409.219 At least so far they are not harassing us. 023622.129 --> 023625.093 Expeditious Retreat! As a reaction. 023712.859 --> 023715.912 Yep. 023716.554 --> 023721.701 Whatever I've got ten minutes of zip, baby! Let's go forward. 023739.857 --> 023744.122 I'll say that they're 20 feet ahead of us and 20 feet behind. 023825.637 --> 023828.388 Has it been over ten minutes? 024539.993 --> 024541.574 Yeah, it lasts ten minutes. 024543.803 --> 024548.856 I'm already in there. 024645.748 --> 024647.472 15. 024651.946 --> 024656.672 Are these arcane glyphs, or is this language? 024834.107 --> 024837.396 24. 024858.243 --> 024900.290 Did I pick up on the fact that Caduceus was looking at glyphs in the wall? Did I see those as well? 025039.558 --> 025040.618 No? Okay. 025041.711 --> 025046.973 What you told me was that studying this thing, it seems to require elements to set it in 025339.221 --> 025342.787 motion? How did you describe it? 025342.787 --> 025350.378 It is The Ring! 025539.510 --> 025547.045 There's the throne over there. 025612.501 --> 025615.059 So is Nott the Brave. 025707.313 --> 025710.968 Four. 025801.821 --> 025803.698 I'm assuming the ten minutes for Expeditious is gone from studying the table? 025808.158 --> 025813.029 A minute or two left. Okay. Great, I'll take it. 025817.282 --> 025822.733 Son of a bitch. 030238.818 --> 030252.157 Frightened. 030253.211 --> 030254.586 Fuck you! Come at me, you sea hag! 030334.901 --> 030335.695 Another one? Oh, good. 030447.674 --> 030453.106 Really could have used that periapt right about now. 030547.757 --> 030549.307 Oh, the lights are out. 030609.889 --> 030611.717 On top of seven, or six total? 031300.126 --> 031301.703 Seven total. So I got that. 031303.333 --> 031305.610 But Expeditious Retreat is gone. 031312.389 --> 031313.119 Is Mage Armor gone? 031314.271 --> 031317.559 If I crouch behind the table from where Dashilla is, will I get half cover or something? 031430.838 --> 031433.122 Okay. So I am going to do that and then I am going to-- 031435.898 --> 031437.481 I would like to stay semi-crouched to try and get some cover from that thing. 031443.072 --> 031444.424 Thank you. And I pull a twisted blackened twig out and point it at her and cast Witch Bolt 031453.321 --> 031454.522 at fourth level. 031454.522 --> 031455.635 That's a ranged spell attack, correct? 031507.946 --> 031512.379 Plus the Bless? 031514.034 --> 031515.290 TRAVIS AND Spell attack is 13, plus the Bless is a d4? 031522.222 --> 031522.933 It's a d4. So, 14. 031528.783 --> 031531.821 Blast it. Gone. 031533.457 --> 031540.095 Them's the breaks. Them's the breaks. 031554.787 --> 031557.631 The murk. It's just physical crap filling the water? 032722.034 --> 032727.805 Desperation. 032840.782 --> 032842.993 He just threw the basketball over his shoulder from half court. 032918.207 --> 032923.527 It's not necessarily a magical effect. 033054.161 --> 033055.724 If it's magic. 033059.417 --> 033105.699 That's why I asked if it was shit in the water. 033115.298 --> 033119.976 Where are they? 033152.775 --> 033154.003 I'm going to cast Detect Magic because I have a suspicion that she has something on her, or 033202.846 --> 033209.121 perhaps the orb in her head. Then I will down the potion that's in my pocket as a bonus action. 033209.121 --> 033210.626 Yeah. 033211.232 --> 033216.823 Ah! 033219.334 --> 033222.187 Okay, so I get six points back from that. I am going to move towards Fjord and crouch behind 033237.248 --> 033238.349 the table. 033238.349 --> 033239.046 A little closer this way, so I'd be between Fjord and the table. <i>Ja, gut</i>. 033242.984 --> 033244.506 Yes. Trying to get cover again. 033246.376 --> 033250.467 So it doesn't affect just movement. It's everything? 033317.874 --> 033327.080 Oh yeah. 14. 033341.262 --> 033346.231 Ah! You were Fjord in that moment. 033351.358 --> 033356.110 (laughter) 033356.110 --> 033357.016 I'll bring back cookies. 033411.430 --> 033413.022 Sorry! 033413.695 --> 033414.886 14. 033910.019 --> 033910.782 Yeah, this is a fucked situation. I am going to hold Magic Missile at second level if she appears. 034529.858 --> 034531.144 Just in case. 034532.495 --> 034536.364 That's pitiful. 034551.152 --> 034558.846 Oh, get her! 034559.952 --> 034601.601 Shuriken! 034604.659 --> 034608.849 You're right there. She probably busted everything to get there. 034613.341 --> 034615.128 14. 034902.528 --> 034903.354 Ooh. 034903.992 --> 034905.732 Fuck you, ghost. 034922.889 --> 034924.782 So my held Magic Missile fizzles because time passes, right? 035119.619 --> 035120.556 I have a question to you, when you've done that. 035201.119 --> 035201.639 Back in the chamber, Detect Magic is still up. Does Caleb see anything with an arcane glow in 035207.342 --> 035209.614 this room other than what Fjord picked up? 035209.614 --> 035212.728 So none of the shit around the edges, okay. I guess I will start studying the runes on the 035221.914 --> 035227.340 walls to see how they contribute to this mystery. 035227.340 --> 035229.419 This gets the d4? 035234.306 --> 035237.529 14. 035238.474 --> 035249.767 On a whim, I'm going to use a 2nd-level spell slot to cast Comprehend Language instantly 035313.578 --> 035318.842 to see if anything becomes clearer, and I have to touch the table and touch the walls to do that. 035318.842 --> 035326.604 What are we doing here, Fjord? 035339.153 --> 035343.520 We should go, she's not going to follow us to the surface. 035514.855 --> 035519.263 What are your goals? Your goal is, what, to--? 035529.273 --> 035532.620 You know what Avantika talked about, you know what she wanted. You think this has nothing 035537.845 --> 035539.537 to do with that? 035539.537 --> 035546.926 Yeah, but if that was some sort of lock, you want to put the key in that lock? 035557.829 --> 035558.674 Do you feel any different? 035601.397 --> 035611.716 Wrapping up in here. 035845.668 --> 035859.817 I'm going to go fuck a ghost! 040011.518 --> 040018.741 Too slow, shit stain! 040030.568 --> 040036.299 Ghost puncher! 040039.991 --> 040042.253 You're hitting his pressure points. 040104.097 --> 040105.057 Yeah, I have some ideas and I am curious, but I want to know what you intend. These come in 040421.641 --> 040422.713 threes, yeah? 040422.713 --> 040427.957 No. 040433.069 --> 040435.109 Yeah. 040436.477 --> 040441.959 I'm always curious. Can I count on you to return the favor? 040455.881 --> 040457.095 (slicing) (slamming) 040459.279 --> 040512.701 Has anything changed with the ones on the walls? 040532.439 --> 040534.083 Okay. I've rolled ass all night, and a natural 20. 040537.842 --> 040543.984 About nine more. 040606.468 --> 040608.067 Thank you. 040657.823 --> 040700.234 I'm following your lead here. This is your quest. I have things that I need to do that are 040721.533 --> 040723.922 not here, and I am going to need help. 040723.922 --> 040738.540 Okay. 040745.493 --> 040748.287 I follow Fjord out. 040803.641 --> 040808.917 Looking out for this hag as we go, yeah. 040944.364 --> 040948.052 Oh. Still terrible. Ten. 040959.361 --> 041002.592 I would assume that next game, we're going to start with a fresh day, so I want to toss in 041448.083 --> 041456.398 that Caleb goes to whatever chamber they're in and he pulls out the other book from his holsters and 041456.398 --> 041458.953 he writes for hours. 041458.953 --> 041506.720 I came out of that with a favor. 041558.505 --> 041559.859 TRAVIS and
