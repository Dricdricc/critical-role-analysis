Vat eez zis present? [static] Well, Vax walks right up to him and walks behind him and grabs him by the hair, and right back to this position. Let's have a talk. Would you care to have a chat? I take my dagger and stick it in about a centimeter and say, your master is gone, it's just you and your friends here now, I think it's in your best interest to talk. You could walk away from here. You don't have to die if you can play nicely. Natural 20! (all laugh and cheer) Who's this king of yours? Just a couple of more questions. It's like Pig Latin. Ere-way are the idden-hay assages-pay? She's bonafide. Vex'ahlia? We'll leave you alive. Yes. And you can advise-- Clarota. Does he know anything about K'varn? I walk up-- -- next to Clarota, push the dwarf against the wall, and say, our friend here is not as patient as I am. We want to know about this K'varn, and we want you and all your men, all your little mates here, to throw your weapons into the chasm, you can go fuck off, but we want to know everything. And this is your last chance. Right now, right here. Talk. That's correct. What is K'varn? Insight check for me as well. It's clearly a narwhal. It's a sentient narwhal. I am, too. Why don't you strip? We already told you your weapons are ours. He tried to make a book out of someone's flesh once. Yes, sorry. Shite. Insight check. Is he full of shit? I rolled-- Oh, nothing too hot at all. Never mind, forget it. Forget I said anything. Stepping behind, I take my knife, and I cut his belt loose and let his pants fall, and I give him a little nudge. Sure. Aw, that's a shame. Wasn't the deal. Wasn't the deal! We said you were alive, your weapons were ours. What, have you got shit in your ears? Your skull is unspoiled. Yeah, we can. Perception check. Perception check. 18 for me. I'm gonna attack him. Yeah? I'm throwing a dagger at him. Yeah. Oh good, that's great. 28 for me. Yeah, sure it does. Dick! Yeah, that's fine. Ten for me. Ten. Ten. (sings) Do do do do doo, I'm lovin' it. (all laugh) Mm-hm. Tiberius, can you tell us anything about these things? There's not any kind of dark magic about the armor, is there? Yes, that's fine. Sh! So, he spoke of some sort of trap door that's easy to open from within, but not from outside, correct? The smaller of the two. Yeah, we-- Well, he was about to walk out the door and cause mayhem. We should just get out of here. Keyleth, can you fucking eagle up and let's go. We need to get out, now. Tiberius. Cast Fly on this fucker right here, we need to get out of here. We just need to get out the way we came in. Like a thousand yards. The carpet's away, but this guy is flying? Flying Grog. No, you can't go on the carpet. You're too heavy. We're going up. Straight up. He's in goblin town. 29. Just keep going up, up, up. That's good, that's good. Double crits, oh. Good thing you got a thousand hit points. That's the point of a meat tank. If Scanlan were here, he'd moon and blind all. He's here, he's watching. Yeah, home slice. I think we should friggin' dive bomb towards the far tunnel past this war camp. Is fine, he's hiding out. They don't know he's here. We're going to dive. Yes, dive bomb, dive bomb! I take hold of the front of the carpet and steer it up and over, along the roof and then down towards the tunnel. I'm steering the carpet. We don't have to. That seems complicated. She's not an eagle and she's falling with the gnomes. I don't know, are we? Parallel? Dive, dive, dive, dive! Party trick. Even wizards make mistakes. Okay. 25. I let go of the front of the carpet, I stick a-- I have a rope. I let go of the front of the carpet, I put one end of the rope in my sister's hand, and I jump off towards Pike, holding it around in one hand as I go-- #savecriticalrole. But wait, Dungeon Master? Re-explain what's happening. So the carpet is falling, not as fast as it would, but-- How high are we at this second? And the closest building, the highest building under us is how tall? Ohh. Unpause. How far are we from the tunnel that we were talking about? I'm grabbing for Pike and going like this. Grog's gone. Grog's down. Do what? You fall a lot. This is tense. We're gonna hit, we're gonna hit. I'm shielding the healer. Intelligence? Good, good, good, good. 24. Yeah, so I'm pretty smart. Still holding a gnome! I guess that's what we'll find out afterwards. Do the halflings-- Shit! Do the gnomes get an advantage since the half-elves are protecting them? Oh, okay. Oh no! Yeah, I got Pike. 18. Doesn't matter. It's all right, I got the healer, I got the healer. (pff) Everybody, everybody? 18. It was halved, so eight. No, sorry, no. Vax is pulling up Pike onto her feet and dragging her towards Scanlan, 'cause I know how fucked up he was from the last battle. But so is Scanlan. Scanlan's out, too, right? You take Scanlan, I'll take Percy. Healing potions out. Sorry, here's three-- Sorry I'm late, Percy. He's all right, he's all right, he's all right. I've got a healing potion and I'm pouring it-- I'm pinching Percy's nose and pouring it in his mouth. I think so. (whispers) 2d4 + 2. Eight. Eight for Percy. Yes. Let's get the fuck out of here and they can-- We gotta keep moving. I pull out another corked potion and slap it into Percy's hand. And then grab him by the wrist and just start walking. Oh, I feel good! Clarota! Clarota, yeah. Clarota. He's gotta have more than ten hit points. Completely seals it? They could have magic in their possession, they could use magic as well, so let's move. Felicia Day, that's not nice! Let's keep moving, yes? Yes. No, that's-- hold on a second. I take out the flying carpet-- Sure we do! Here, sit on this, Clarota. That'd be easier, yes. That guy was lying. 21 for me. I'm keeping my eyes peeled for useful shit. Clarota, do you know anything about these passages? This is a coin flip. Running, running? Really running? It's like having Goofy as a party member. (all laugh) Any useful shit? No! If you seal off the passage, right, we keep going down, and if that's a dead end-- it's probably not-- if it is, can't we rest and use the same spell to open it up? That sucks. Yes, we know that about you. What about in the game, though? I think we should rest. I'm totally fine at the moment, so I'll stay awake too. Yes. I don't think it's a good idea. We're fine. It's warm down here. Yes. We've got Tiberius, if he's awake, can cast Light, let's just go into one of these tents. I pull out some dice, so that Grog and I can gamble while everyone are sleeping. (Cary Elwes voice) Gently! Gently! Off to the side. Many footsteps. How many does it sound like? From, right, from up? Or down. From above. Wait. Grog and I are the only ones awake, right? Grog and I are the only ones awake. Do we lay low, and hold quiet in these tents? Or do we get everyone up? Yeah. I think so. No, no, no, I rouse my sister quietly. She's in this tent. (whispers) Quiet. Yeah. 23. You know, when you can't fall asleep-- -- and you're like, am I dreaming? Or is this the dream? Or is it real? And you wake up, and you have to pee, it's hard to tell. Shake it off. Sh! Sh. Daggers out! Daggers out! Not dark vision. There's no fire-- On purpose no fire. Sh, sh! They're going! Last time I did that I got kicked in the nuts, very hard. Sure. So what does that do to us? Yes. Skill? Skill. Okay. Just for emergencies. In combat. I have a question. Outside of existence. Tiberius put up a stone, right? But I didn't hear any (impact sounds), right? Oh. So we sealed ourselves into this little pocket? Oh. We didn't even friggin' need to hide in the tent! We were in a little bubble of air! Okay. Spaces. Okay. All right. Thank you. Right. We're all healed, maybe-- Does anyone have to pee? Or perhaps-- Start smacking the wall. Might need to take your armor off. (singing) That's fuckin' teamwork. There are also some, I believe some duergar we didn't tell you-- Yes, while you were sleeping in the middle of the night, duergar walked-- I assume-- Duraga. But we thought it best to lay low and they went on. So, steady as she goes. Going the homeopathic route, I like it. Smells like Grog. That was quick. (all laugh) I insult you and you trip me in a half a second? Would you like to take a shot at my nads as well? What goes around comes around, baby. 22. I'm going to voluntarily erase one hit point. It's all right, when the illithid general is bearing down on your walnut-sized brain-- I may be there, I may not. Right, everyone, we're getting slap-happy. That was a high acrobatics roll. I think the DM wanted me to eat shit. Oh, really? It was a direct contest? You still wanted me to eat shit. Sounds dirty. Did you see any whales? No whales. Oh. That sounds creepy That sounds really shitty. It feels a bit-- broken glass. In which of those places? In the-- Fungal. He sounds like a real fun-guy. I'm a dad. (all laugh) What is that? Wisdom? 12. Noted, noted. Percy's losing his shit. Everyone, there's footsteps coming from ahead. Let Vex'ahlia and I scout ahead. Wait for a moment. 22 for me. Well it's definitely not duergar. How far ahead of us do they sound? I'm listening, trying to make out how many sets of footsteps I can hear. But there's lava spilling and we can see in dim light. Cart. Could be some sort of device-- Can we tell what they are? Yes. Separate sides. I also yank my serpentine belt off-- And throw it out, right under the rope. Snake. Yes, it is. And I leap out, daggers at the fallen one. Hashtag bitches in lava? I got 99 problems and a troll ain't one. 15. 15, yeah. LIAM and Yes. I'm already jumping in the air, so I'm gonna go. Okay, and this, since it's a surprise, it's automatic crit? Okay, okay, all right, so that's 28. Yeah, 1d4 for-- this is my poison dagger. Two, eight, okay, I'm doing my Sneak Attack damage, here we go, four, nine, 12, 18, yeah, 23. Total for that, 62 points of damage. And I use my bonus action to hide. Natural 20. See you later, motherfuckers. That's a ten. Ah yes! Bellybutton. Still pretty cool, still pretty cool. They're dumber than Grog is. It's part of his charm. (whispers) You can't see me. Oh dear, something's coming out of the jar. No. No. It's dangerous! It's dangerous! It's fucking dangerous! It's black ooze. It's dangerous! It's fucking dangerous. Stay away from it. Stay away from it. Stay away from it. French kiss that shit! Ranged attacks. Fire and ranged attacks. Think! Sing, Sam! Sing! (sings) We're up all night in the dark, we're up all night in the dark. TALIESIN and Oh shit, the music! The music! Ranged attack, ranged attack. Sounds good. Hit it, hit it, hit it. Yes, it is! It's a crit. Isn't 19-20 crit? That's just for me. Yeah, it splits into smaller ones. Smaller sizes. All right, I'm gonna run up to the back of Tall and Ugly, and try to stab him. I'm gonna do the reach-around again, and try to stab him in the eyes. ORION and And I'm hidden-- I'm stealth already, I think, right? So the first attack is an 18. Okay, Sneak Attack, here we go. For the eyeballs. Two plus seven is-- 40. 52. As it does, I want to use my bonus action to spring off his shoulders towards my friends. Sure. That's a 15. (sneezes dramatically) (Cosby voice) You see, the black goo thing-- -- is not so easy to kill. (all laugh) What was that sound it made again? Yes! Aw, yes! Burn it! Hey, that was pretty good. So long! Very Old Testament! Get closer. Gotta run up. I'd just like to point out, this is like the Avengers trailer, where all the heroes run out and jump at the same time. (all laugh) Do it, do it, try it. Do it. Come on, you're a warrior. Ten. 25. That's better. Oh man, you the real MVP. Wow. Work those rules. How is he keeping all of this in his mind? It's like a computer in his brain. Grog, math hard. That's nothing for Grog, that's nothing. No, we stayed up and kept watch. Tank. Double that? Double that, or that? He has to look. He was hanging back. Nah, he was hanging back. He's weak. He's got this, but he doesn't have this. He's weak, he's hanging back. What is the deal with the mind flayer? Shit. Shit. Oh, man. Oh, Tiberius, our soft, vulnerable spot. Yes! Yes! Half-elves see in dim light up to 60 feet. Does that pool of lava give anything? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna run over the dude in the lava, I'm gonna jump on him, probably make an acrobatics check and land right around here, between the two little slimes. Yeah. It's acrobatics. 22. Now, because they are, because Grog is-- Fine. Okay. It's fine. Yeah. Okay. Okay and since I land, since Grog is right up against those two-- I can Sneak Attack one or both of them, so I'm gonna hit the one closest to the party first. This is Sneak Attack. This is, this is-- It's an 18. Three plus seven is-- this is my flametongue dagger, so that's-- Oh, hold on, no, I don't know what it is yet. Where's my pencil? I'm sending my dice everywhere. Nine plus six, ten, 15, 18, 40. 58 on one slime. The piercing damage? So I don't know. What is that? Is that what's besides the Sneak Attack damage? That's 18. If it's doubled for the Sneak Attack? I don't know. It's nine, without a Sneak Attack. 18 if it's Sneak Attack. So 18 for Sneak Attack. That's first dagger. Second dagger attacks the other one. I just turn around and sink down into the other one for 16 with the keen, yeah, 16 with the keen dagger. Okay, and this is probably not Sneak Attack at this point, or is it? I don't know. Okay, eight. 20, you said? Okay. All right. It's all right. Pow, pow, pow, pow. Wow. Not sure how I feel about that. I'm all on my own. Hey man, if I can't be a hero here, where am I gonna do it? I'm surrounded by shit. I am surrounded by shit. I'm going unconscious here, kids. (Tommy Wiseau voice) Oh, hi, Pike. (all laugh) Hit it? Yeah. Do I have to roll to do that? Right? 26. 11. Yeah. That's the damage. 11. Oh, yeah yeah yeah. Son of a gun. Masochists. Sure they are. Yeah, that hits 'cause I'm at 19. Right? So that hits if I'm at 19? Okay, so I use Uncanny Dodge on the one that hit. Whoa! Half-damage. That's right. Oh, I am rough, kids. I am rough. Use your magic, you strange flayer, you. That's awesome. (Cosby voice) You see-- Two oozes and a monster man. Oh, he's pulling a Vax. Up up down down left right left right. Shrimping, cool. Maybe. The one right behind me. Excellent. You do. You have the die. Kill it. Kill it. Thank you. All right. I walk back about 15 feet, and I go (shnk-shnk). Throw daggers at it. First one's a 15. Okay and that is-- this is my keen dagger. That is nine. Second dagger. Definitely hits, that's a 26. That's fine. This is flametongue. I don't know if fire helps, but that is an eight. So nine and an eight. Except that they teleport back to my blink belt. Shite. Finish that shit, Pike. Hit it. He'll be fine in ten minutes, Pike. He's out of the fight, but he'll be fine. (sings) Thorn Whip. (sings) Thorn Whip, the bitch is dead. You tried to kill us, but you failed. Just in seven more weeks. Trinket's on the sidelines, man. We're not going back. But it was like three years, Trinket was by your side. This is the first time ever. You killed them all, Grog! You were magnificent! Yes, 'cause I'm at four hit points. Oh, brother, where art thou? Oh! Oh! Oh! Fancy you! Blah-blah-blah-blah! (all laugh) I'm at four hit points! You go fuck yourself. I was trying to save his ass! I was hurting myself on purpose. That's pretty good. That's half-ish. Half-ish. Yes. I'm burnt. Yes. It was-- it's magical. I found it in the goblin city. Studded leather armor, plus two. Wait. Do you know what's funny? What's funny is, the armor I had before this, that I wasn't paying attention to, was acid resistant! Isn't that funny? That's so funny! It's in my bag! Even better! Hold on, hold on. DM! DM. I take off my magical armor, which was dwarven in shape before-- -- but I take it off, it shrinks down to like a little toddler-- I'm wearing, like, a Scientology unibody underwear underneath-- (all laugh) The armor shrinks down to like toddler-size-- -- and I hand it to Grog. And I go to my pack and I take out my old armor, which is acid resistant. Not quite as cool as what I was wearing, but I don't want him-- I can't-- huh? I can't stare at his pecs for the next three days, so I'll give him my armor. Ooh! And put on what I had on before. Studded leather armor plus two, okay? I've got my old armor. I found that armor down here. That's a loaner. No, it's more complicated than that. Loaner! Loaner. Loaner. Grog could do it. Thank you. So we searched the ogres, that's it. I guess we should just start walking further down. Let's rest for a half-hour or so. Can you explain? I don't think I understand. Can you explain with your map, Matt? I get we doubled back, but it would help the visual, I think. All right, we'll go get your bear. That's fate, that's kismet. You go on it, right? I don't know. We were flexing our muscles a little bit. Who's this guy? How soon will that start? I'll stay for 20.
