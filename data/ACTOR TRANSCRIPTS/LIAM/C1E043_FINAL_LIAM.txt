I love you. Lies. We have a team of hundreds that man the Twitter handle with information. It's Marisha and I. (laughter) Sam's here! You look handsomer. "Oh, hallo"-- (laughter) We are in an intimate relationship with Wyrmwood Gaming and if you go to wyrmwoodgaming.com and use the code "critrole," "critrole," you will get free shipping on these beautiful boxes. They hold dice. Enchanted by witches. I went to NYU. Love that guy. Yeah, we slept at the Slayer's Take, we talked to Aldor for a minute, right? Is there one? That's a good idea, Percy. Yes. What game are you talking about? We don't have time for games, there are dragons that need dealing with. Stick to music, please. We don't need games. Yeah, Merkel's wife. Do you think Kima wants to go potion-shopping? Maybe we should go get some shit and then see Kima? I think Kima would be a little impatient. Sister, dear, how much coin do we have at the moment? How many Pop-Tarts do we have? In the party, if anyone's holding coin, because I don't have much at all. I don't need much, but we do need healing potions. You're in charge, let's go. Oh, jeez! You are impressive. I would not bring-- good to see you again-- I wouldn't bring that up. Hey, what's in that bag? Yes. What you say is correct. These are the first moments after us finding out, this is a first step. But being members here and seeing what your people can do [no audio] I know this is just a first step, and we're about to enter Vasselheim proper, but-- Can we count on you? The sphinx. Information is welcome and we are thankful. And we have been impressed by your wisdom, very much so. The people you employ are chosen very carefully and very well and we all have been impressed. In addition to information, you provide a service with the Slayer's Take to Vasselheim. Do you have any interest in spreading that influence to Emon, if we can save it? How so? No, no. Well then, allow us to do you a service. We have had dealings with his underlings. We have knowledge, which we freely give. Freely. If it does anything to help our case, winning your aid. And we will seek your partner and we will find your partner. We're not trying to score points, we are trying to do right. Percival? We thank you for your time. We are your willing allies. Zahra. You said, "We shall." Have we convinced you? Yeth? Do you really think the Mending Wheel, though, would help us against Thordak? They're opting out of the conversation. Do you think she's still there, Grog? Yeah, that's the expression, I'm pretty sure that's the expression. We need Kima. Potions first. I don't want to bore Kima, then Kima. Yes? It would be welcome. We're about to get really fucking active. Can I give advantage if I go like this the whole time? It's welcome, it's very welcome. Which way is the potion shop from here? Yeah, we haven't been here-- None. Hey, I'm squishy as hell, can I have one? (whispers) But her voice is so deep! Vanessa, hey. I'm not asking anything. We're going to get you into Emon. That's a promise. We're going to double your fucking business. Mirrors. In town? We're so nice! What the fuck is that about?! No, he's fine. And I am. No! No, he's-- He's useful. And I don't hold anything against him, and she's-- why wouldn't he want her? Of course he does. Well, so are you, but what the fuck am I going to do with that? Jeez, you're fucking weird. And I walk off. (laughter) Yeah, I mean, it's funny, but we don't have that much gold. Grog, what about this? You are really strong and really good at killing things and my left-- left? Yeah. Nut still has a dent in it. You are really fucking strong. You are the best there is at what you do. Please shut up. My sister is very good at-- do you know what math is? Vex'ahlia is very good at-- She is an excellent shopper. I'm telling you, you know how you take things' skulls and turn them into like raspberry jam? Yeah, that's what she does with money. And I'm saying, we've had our differences, and I know you're stronger than me and I'm saying as strong as you are, that's as good as she is with shiny. I say, shut up! It was a little bit of pressure. Bulk. (whispers) Stick to the killing! Put them away, put them away. Knickknacks. Roll that Snitch! Yeah, gang. This is like matryoshka nesting dolls. (laughter) That bass is singing! Laughter during a game, what a novelty! I take one of my daggers. And looking at him, I stick it in Grog's arm and I drag it down and I never take my eyes off him. There's no magic here, friend. No, no, it's brilliant. Let it play. Let it play. Ah, there's so much blood on this fucking dagger. Ugh. Cross your fingers. Who's got the potions? Who's got the potions? Ah, I'm so fast, but I'm really weak. Can I have another one? I know you did. But I get fucked up really easily. Could I have another one? Yeah. Just another, one more. Thank you. What's that, Smoke Man? That's low. What's this character called? What's this character called? He needs the Bang Bang Man. No, I'm going to help-- no, I'll see you in a bit. Bring him out. Bring him out! Percy, that's not a good idea. I'm going to stand over here and fail to stay in character, okay? (laughter) All you need is a five. If I may-- (cheering) Oh, man. Hire that fucking fool! (laughter) You said she was lush, you didn't say she was a lush. Keek. How many of those have you had? Less than five? Which one of us? What was that? I would rather be with you all than the finest people in the world. Meeting of the minds. That's like half a penny. (laughter) I raise the bottom of Keyleth's glass and keep it going. (laughter) Yeah, I think we've accidentally gotten shit-faced. No. We're drunk. Here's what we should do. You ready? We should go watch Grog fight. We need-- listen to me. We need Kima with us, but Kima doesn't have time for fucking drunkards. You might not be, but some of us are a little drunk. So, while that's going on, we wait a day, right? And while that day is going on, we watch Grog pummel some person's face in. Hey, look at that guy who went out the door! He looked like that guy you fought in that ring. That guy, yeah. Go get (stammering) do it again. Oh, come on, Grog. No man's-- you know-- goes straight on. Goes a little bit to the left, a bit of-- I go sit down next to Kash. Excuse me, if I may. All I want to say is that you are a very impressive man in many ways. You are handsome and capable. That's a little creepy, but other than that, you are very, very capable-- Percival, I'm having trouble focusing, so if you could sort of go behind Kash. No, no. No, no, no, no. There's only one man for me. All I'm saying is-- (slurring) We could use your help, all right? I know you're a bit of a mercenary, but you are a very capable man and there is a lot at stake. There is a lot at stake. There are dragons, they killed-- I'm not going to get into it. But I implore you to look past yourself and please try to think of the greater world. (stuttering) I'm an admirer-- Yes. Also, one last thing. You know what, never mind. I don't want to talk about that. And I wander off into the other side of the room. (muffled) It's dark in this closet! How do you get this closet door open? I can't get back out here. What is high school? Vex! I can't get out of this closet. (mournfully) I rolled a one. I can't get out of this closet as hard as I try. We're identical. I think we need to go to bed. 17 hours later?! (laughter) That was great. Man. [break] Grog, can you get this door open? (laughter) Is Grog fighting? Yeah, right now. A lot of horses and chickens around here, too. Everywhere. Will Kima be there? Hey! (whispers) Yes. 13. But let's talk about-- My bad. I've got all my dragon lore over here. Just give me a second. May I ask-- Vestiges, the word in these legends, it seems vague. Does no one know anything about what they were? Is that a stand-in for things we don't understand or know about? What are these Vestiges? We just parted ways with her-- (groans) I have such a headache. And I very obviously chug the entire thing. Let's count out the things that we want to do. Not what we're going to choose, just what we have to do, and then we'll choose something. We've got the Cobalt Reserve, which may or may not be totally fucked, right? Okay. So there's Osysa's mate. Down by Westruun, in the mountains. Yeah. We've got your people. Three options. Are we forgetting anything? Let's just talk-- I mean, if we're spiraling out, right? Earthbreaker's here, Ashari are close by, and then we're talking about in and around Westruun. Level up. Lead the way, shitkicker! Verily, verily. (whispers) What's he talking about, Grog? 34. I would just like to point out that I am mostly sober. Natural 20! 25 off a natural 20! I'm peeing just a little bit. 25 off a natural 20. Click my Boots of Haste. (laughter) And use my bonus action to hide behind Grog's thigh and hold my turn. Until Grog moves towards the Earthbreaker. When he does it I'm gonna go with him and fight him if I can. Oh boy. Oh boy. Well, let me just think for ten seconds only. Yeah, okay, so, I use my bonus action to hide. Do I need to roll for that? Yeah. That's a-- No, that's fine, because remember, I'm me. So that is, that's a 25. I guess behind Grog. No, I'm going to throw fucking daggers at this guy! Because I'm first. Oh my god. I am. First is 24? And then, so I used my bonus action to hide, which means I can do two, right? So the second is not that great. Using Luck. Better. Second is a 30. Okay, now. This is, I'm the first to attack, which means that it is-- Ooh, it's a 19. I'm Sharpshooter, man. 60. Okay, so. I'm hidden behind Grog so it should be sneak attack, and I'm the first to go so it's a crit. It's not a sneak attack? Even though I used my bonus to hide behind Grog's big fat leg? He's huge! All right, okay. I'm drunk and fighting in a pit! All right, all right. So there is no sneak attack, but it is crit, right? Because I'm the first to attack? He's not surprised. Oh god. I'm drunk, tell me what's going on. One plus seven's eight, and then eight. Eight and eight. Okay, I'm gonna use Uncanny Dodge. Oh, I'm sorry. Scanlan Shorthalt. That is amazing! Grog, Grog, Grog, do we really want to do this? He's down, he's asleep! Are we doing this, are we really doing this? He's asleep. We're not trying to kill him, we want him to work with us. Excuse me? All right, so, I use disen-- no, I don't have to. Yeah, okay. So I got two daggers in my hands, and they spin around in my hand, and I just start beating him in the head. Yes, it is, because Grog's right there. 21. Oh, well then it is a 32. And then the second one is a 27 and the third one is a 17. First two hit, and the first one is sneak attack with the blunt edge. Yeah it is. Oh, I'm so sorry! Nine. Plus-- Whoa. That is ten, 16, 22, 23, 25, is 50? Plus the-- 59. 59 for the first. Ooh, that's the wrong one. And then the second dagger does ten. And I'm gonna use my movement to run around and to roll around behind Grog's buttocks. Acrobatics? To hit? Oh, that's an attack. Even though he was unconscious? Yeah, I'm feeling that. Uncanny Dodge. Ah, fucking ankle. Come on. Yes. I'm so acrobatic. No. That hits. Two of those hit. Like a tree cracking in the wind from this guy. Okay, got it, got it, got it. He's still pressed up against Grog, right? All right, I'm gonna use disengage and pivot around Grog, right, run all around the circle and get behind Scanlan. Yeah. And I'm gonna throw two daggers at him, yeah. The first one's, okay, natural 20! Wait, it's natural 20 on top of a sneak attack, what happens? You double the sneak-attack? Let me take a moment. (laughter) Okay, that's a nine. Okay. Think I want to savor this. All right. So. Oh my god. (counting) 23 doubled, quadrupled-- 23. 28. Not quadrupled, oh! So sneak attack is not doubled, then on top-- All right. So it doesn't stack. Yeah, but he's, he's up against Grog. So I get-- So I double sneak-attack damage. 23, the sneak-attack damage is-- 56. All right. Yeah. 68. Critical hit on a sneak attack. Got it, got it, got it. I'm gonna use my last bit of Luck so that he has to roll again. Okay. Oh, all right. And I duck behind Scanlan. Yeah, sure. It's, that was a four, ten. No, I rolled, I rolled a bunch of times. Didn't I roll a bunch of times? Okay, all right, well. She rolled a 20. I rolled a, oh that did fine. It's a 27. Second one is ten. Nine. I'm scared to death, which is why the math is so bad. Don't want to be fighting you. Plus inspiration. It's a 23. It's Uma Thurman, it's fucking Kill Bill. MARISHA and But he's a sponge! On your same page, your spell page. Come on, Scanbo. I just drop to my knees so I can aim better and right over Scanlan's shoulder, dagger, dagger, dagger. Okay, first one is a one. So that misses. Second one is a 23. Disadvantage? For what? Oh shite. Well, the first one was a one and a-- I don't remember what it was. Sorry. All right, so this is the second attack. That is a 17. Third attack is a 21. And just under my breath I say, "So fucking cool." (laughter) You said the last one. Whoa, buddy. Debatable. Oh, thanks. He Van Damme'd it! You might already know this, but I'm wearing my Cloak of Displacement, so he should be at disadvantage to hit me. Yeah, thanks. I want to use one action to grab Scanlan by his purple shirt and rip him and pull him away. Sure. With Boots of Haste on? That's fine, that's fine, I rip him, I yank him away and throw the little bugger. And then throw a dagger past Grog at him. For-- not that great. 19. 19, that's it. Okay, so I threw him, I threw a dagger and missed, and I just juke to the right and get behind Grog. We got this, guys. Me once, Grog once-- Uncanny Dodge. That hits. So first one Uncanny Dodge, second one full brunt. I'm Vax. Every time. Seven. Yeah. Nine points. Okay. Okay. It's gonna be great. 14. Yes. Yep. (strained noise) (garbled yell) Gently! I'm okay. No. Wait, wait, (vomiting noises) I'm ready. Come on, it was their loincloths, come on. And as Keyleth helps me away, I say to Kord, it was an honor, thank you. Whatever his name is. (laughter) What a fun episode.
