Could you do it different though? Jesus for everybody. He's my favorite. We are noble creatures. I have been sort of shadowing Grog for a couple of days, 'cause he doesn't have any gnomes to hang out with. I have been playing Boulder, Parchment, Shears, and telling him stories. Yes, yes. Just hanging out, off and on. Does your real self also get sea sick? Careful, butterfingers. Natural one, the spyglass has fallen in the ocean. Guess word has gotten around the ship then. Is Tary down below? Hey, man! You can't walk off in the middle of a game of hide-and-seek again. I've been in a barrel for an hour! I fell asleep in there! No, I just woke up in a barrel, I don't even know what time it is-- Touch√©, Grog. Uh. Do you want me to do a reach-around, is that what you're asking me to do? Okay, yeah, this is not like the wood nymph-- Never mind. I go ahead and do a reach-around, I suppose. Yeah, I'll hang down. Is it a wang? Nice. Okay. Pat, pat, pat. Oh, she's a beaut, Grog, I wish you could see her. (all laugh) Oh, uh. Athletic, hearty. You know, curves in all the right places. Yup, yup. Your type, I think. Uh. It's one good, one good chest, here. You know what, I will draw you a picture. All right? Okay. I'm gonna try to climb up without falling into the drink, all right? Is this my character sheet? (all laugh) This is the best this armor has smelled in weeks! (all laugh) I'm twice as heavy as normal. I start-- Oh yeah, yes, big. Big. That's you. I shake like a husky a little bit. This is the laziest day we've ever had. Just like a prom make-out, that's all. It's the most privacy you've had-- I'm going to hide. Fuck you, physics. Hey! Well, I did a stealth check, and I got a 25-- I didn't know what the boat looked like, so if there's stuff in the bottom, I'd hide there, but if they're gone, I could also have gone up to the crow's nest. Whichever. Okay. Shit. (knocks on table) 18. Yeah. Wapetopetok! LAURA and One of the assailants is directly across from me, on the other side of our boat, right? But there is one guy who made it onto the boat? Right there? I'm gonna attempt to Assassinate that motherfucker. Okay. So, advantage on this. The one that you are touching right now. Yeah. So that is a 32 to hit. So this is Assassinate, it's an auto-crit-- Well, no, but I'm at advantage because of Assassinate, so the first roll was a 19. Which is still a 32. Here we go. Doing my maths over here. 32, 36, 72. That's 80 points of damage. Is he still standing? Okay, just for funsies I will throw my second dagger at the one right in front of Trink. So, that is not that good. That's a 13. No, I'm gonna drop down. And circle around Trinket's tush. Sure. Yeah, 25. Wilhelm scream. I hope these aren't your cousins. They could be werefish or... Hells yeah. Kick his ass. Sure. No. That's a no. That hits. Uncanny Dodge. No. Halved. Tight. She says as she destroys everything. Adele Dazeem, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, that's it. She also breaks hearts. Left and right. You can relate. Bye! For him, right? For him? It's frustrating for him. Vax or Vex? Vax. Yeah, you're fine. Oh, you're doing Trinket, right. 17. But halved, 'cause if I fail, it's halved. If I succeed, it's zero. It's a dexterity so it's Evasion. Evasion is for dex saves. If I fail, I take half damage, and if I succeed I take no damage. It's how I survive dragon fights. Yeah. Mm-hm. Okay, so in the water, click the boots, and the wings shoot-out, and I explode up, out of the water into the air. And I just start gunning it towards the guy who knocked me in, right? And when I'm about, I don't know, 30 feet away from him, I'm gonna-- because I'm hasted I get 120 feet of movement just for regular movement. And when I'm within 40 feet, I'm gonna throw Whisper at the guy. Yep. That's 26? And I'm gonna bamf right up to him as I hit. That is just a little ten, plus-- 15. And I should have one more. So I used bonus action for the wings, I did movement, I did action, so I've got one more action. Yeah. So I will shank him again. 20. That is just a nine! And I'll unload some poison into him as well. The DC is 15. Okay, so he takes 2d10. Do I roll that, or do you, Matty? All right. It's nine. Plus 13 poison damage. Why would I get that here? Is he up against anybody? Oh, advantage, yay, I love you. 20 Sneak Attack damage. Thanks, Matt. 20 for the sneak attack. Shank-shank-shank. Shank-shank-shank. LIAM/TALIESIN/LAURA/ Get him! She shouts as she flies through the air. Is it a leap year? (growls) Goes in the drink. You know when you look at a cat that's alarmed because it's nervous and all the hair is puffed out? Vax's feathers are all going like pffft, watching Keyleth wreck the boat, I could fucking watch you do this all day. Up into the air, and I go and get Tary out of the water. And I'm gonna pick him up and dump him back on our boat, towards the back of the ship. Cool. I'm good. Wait, no, do I have an action left? Can I use Divine Sense right now? Yeah, I am hasted. Okay. I pat him down and go, we're good, we're good, and I'm just gonna make sure he's not a demon. Yes. (bear noises) That made us all so happy. While he's busy, I'm gonna jet over next to Keyleth. Oh, are we in combat rounds? Oh, okay. It's like when you just reach out to pick up something-- Tip your waiters. Wow. Oh, boy! Gosh! Just hundreds and hundreds of NES classics. (sighs) Looks like it's going down pretty fast, though, yeah? (ting) Two or three, give or take. Yeah? Man, you did great! You knocked that guy clear off! Yeah. That's a good start, man. What was it? Oh, you need to ask the white-haired one. I dunno. The worst! Yes. Six seconds of dialogue, right there! I'm gonna do what I said before, and I'm gonna go and land next to Keyleth. We're pretty flush already. Let's make it quick. You might. Looney Tunes! They're taking the hobbits to Isengard. It was a one. Get off! Natural 20. Let's go, man! Was he under water, or was the water-- I'll fly at that. If there's a cage, I'll go to it. Can I even see the lock or where the keys were? All right. That's a 21. All right. While I'm hasted, do I have an action left to get up there and pick it? Yeah? Okay. LAURA and 32. Okay, can I keep going here, or-- And then just try to slowly, messily float him up and out of here. Yeah. All right, so pull. I shout out, Twinnie! This is stupid, Rose! This is stupid! Out come the lungs. He's inside out. What the heck, Laura. Yeah. I do pat, pat, pat, except I cast Lay on Hands when I do it. Seems oddly competitive at this moment, where we're saving a man's life, but all right. Our boat. It's Hotis, it's Hotis, it's Hotis, it's Hotis! Guys, I'm gonna make a Tor Books run, does anybody want anything? From Issylra to Emon. What was your cargo? Insight check. 18. Just come sit with us. Well, we saved your life, how else can we help you, friend? Yeah, I mean, he's shifty as fuck, but it's no skin off my back, right? That question might be great, but I think we're all right. Yeah. Can't you see everything around you? It's all here. I do Van Damme splits, just as he finishes that sentence. Context. Context is key. Hey, Captain. Yeah. I mean, the closest place to us right now is our desination, most likely, right? We're not gonna be able to dump this guy before we arrive, do you think? Oy. Byeee. That was sudden! Yeah. What kind of stuff? No. Do we have rooms? I thought it was like Amex City on this-- It also ensures you cannot get a prom date. It's a couple days-- we've been traveling for a while, right? And has a day passed since that fight? No, this is that night? You're losing some friends. Oh hi, Percy. You're missing your friendo time, I understand. (all laugh) We hear them laughing from their room. (all laugh) They're both, you know, really special and-- Yeah. Yeah. You're his best friend. Yeah, that's just new-- -- and those two have never met-- -- a nerd as pure as the other. You're more than cool. (chuckles) Hi. I dry the tears away. Do you know-- Do you know what's really cool, though? We're not on the verge of death every fucking day right now. Yeah, you know, pluses and minuses. Come here, you. I know, I know. I know. Go interrupt the party. Did it? Put the whole thing? Sure, yeah. (quietly) You got this. Don't face-plant on a reef! I'm on a reef. What are you doing? Hopping on behind my sister. Nah. He's all right. Get kraken. Poopstones. (chuckles) We're gonna give that thing some maylox. (proot fart sound) One of 17. (singing) Tor Books. In Canada? Matt's always talking about his campaign up in Canada, I'm not sure if it's real or not. (all laugh)
