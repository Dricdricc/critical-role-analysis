You were so cute, all of you. It was the cutest orc adventure that ever happened. Both episodes. Wait! Something I can say now. I didn't have the green light, but I am in that game. I had to fib and say that I wasn't in that game, but I'm in that game! I am back as Gollum! And I run around and I do this, and I do this, and I do this, and I do this. (Gollum voice) Tasty fish! Broke my back, scuttled around like I was a young buck, which I'm not. It was great! I put my laptop on the coffee table, I hit click, and I started going-- Because I'm a nerd. Yeah, like when parents have a baby, you don't see them for a while. They're with that baby every hour, every minute. (yelling) Yeah, this is just our viewing copy. There will be more details-- It says The Chronicles of Exandria The Tale of Vox Machina. One. We'd like there to be. And you guys can tune in next week to Talks Machina, where we will have more info, more details. I have been told that I cannot give a teaser flip. But wait, guys. There's more! Taliesin, if you would? We have held that book and looked through it. I cried 97 times in one minute. It is so beautiful. Joe Madureira art! Wait. There's one last thing. I got one last thing, for funsies. It's a really late birthday present. It's kind of for funsies, but Travis, I have something for you that I've been wanting to give you for a while. Yeah, go for it. And your beard will double in length the moment you put it on. I had to repay you for the raven mask you gave me, once upon a time. Your husband just bought this for me! Thanks, Laura! I know a lot about Hellboy. Yes, please! Oh! I bought a Hellboy comic today! Another black compendium book to go with my other big black blades on my shelf. You do have a cold heart. I didn't see you there at all! It was fucking wild. Like an animatronic sailor! Wait, let's come up with some more announcements so we never have to start. Autoerotic a-pixie-ation. Right on time. 31. I've got her. Vex or I can find it. I'm flexing the wings out and around, and I'm making a feather bed with the ends of the wings on the ground and laying Velora down on it. I start combing her hair with my fingers, out of her eyes. Do you have anything a little more potent right now? Your sense of humor is your best quality. Best. Start cleaning her cheeks as well as we can. I pull Simon from around my waist, and I start to fasten it around her. This is yours. You're going to have to take care of him now. His name is Simon. Most people don't think he's alive, but they're wrong. He's very much alive. Take care of him for me. I didn't get nearly enough time with you. I'm sorry. I love you very much. I kiss her on the forehead. I rolled an 18, but I'm going to use Luck. Good. 18 is good. You're an awfully long way from home. He's a friend. Come here. Oh, the joke's on you. Double damage on cows. Yeah. This is the second time around you. I love you, too, Mary. Don't be strangers, though. Look in. Look in if you can. See you later, smart ass. What a callback. Say hello to my even littler friend! I do. I do. I got it. I've seen it. I have the spell slot. Big man, come on. I'm going to need you to dig; it's over here. Yeah. Please. He couldn't touch you, are you kidding? I don't think he has those. That thing could rot. Do you know what preserves a hand? Yeah, after you piss on it. It's like a mole, right? Such a mistake. Safe bet. I don't know those references, but yeah, they are at odds. DM, just for funsies, do I sense Vecna in any way, shape, or form? Okay. Definitely want to piss on that hand, Grog. Grog and I don't share much! Scanlan, you should know you always look cool. Always. Well, maybe in different places. We don't all need to get it in the same place. Maybe on a theme, but not the exact same thing? I got one. And I got one. I have the burnt hand on my back. Elven. No, it's not mostly healed. Scanlan Shorthalt! You don't need a gun to look cool. You are the Meat Man. You are Burt Reynolds. You are a fucking hero. That's the trick I do for my eight-year-old! Why? What are you going to be? Dragon? We deduced that it doesn't take him that long to come back together. And it's been-- But we're right at that cutoff point. That's all you need. That's amazing! This is amazing, and I love you. That is amazing! On his loafers. They're Batman pajamas. He's in the buck! She's saying you got one more shot, and we still have some sunlight. LAURA and That was for finding the Sword of Kas, wasn't it, before we slept? Well, we'll never see him again. Never say never. And as Vax and Keyleth get situated on J'mon's back, I whisper in her ears I was going to say eagle. Giant eagle. This city still stands. You have carried out a miracle. I am the champion of the Raven Queen. And she has allowed me to track his every movement for a while now. He's gone. I'm still holding your hand. Percy. Freddie. You're ready for your people. I am so very proud of you, and so grateful for everything you gave to me. You are going to be a strong leader and a wise leader. I'll never be that far away. And ever and always. Boys. My brothers... I love you. Maybe from the other side. Someday, just for shits and giggles. I'm going to go visit my mother, and I'll see all of you again. Freddie. I know. But I charge you to take good care of my sister and love her. And your friend Keyleth, love her, as well. She will need it. She will need friends. Thank you for trying. You did everything. Pickle? Pickle, you showed me the way. I know it doesn't look like that right now, but you absolutely did. (chuckles) You taught me purpose, Pickle. Purpose. And I know I will see you again. Be there for them. You be there for them. You're the light in all our lives. I never had a greater friend than you. And we traveled a lot, I never had a greater friend than you. I will bring it with me to remind me of you. I will see you again. I will see you again. And I will tell your mother that you say hello. I know that it's hard. And I am sorry. I take Keyleth's face in my hands and happily take one more kiss. I'm sorry it's so cold. I will never stop loving you. I know. For now. I love you, Keyleth of the Air Ashari. I look to the Raven Queen and as I walk closer, since I leveled up, I use the druid cantrip Druidcraft and grow snowdrops out from where I stand, out to all of my family. Out to where they stand. S.H.I.T.s, thank you. How lucky I have been to have had all of you. How lucky, indeed. Thank you. You dingus! The ceiling is one inch above your head. At least three sets of twins. (laughter) Bring him up to eight intelligence. Thank you, Matt. We might look a little different, but we're still going to be here.
