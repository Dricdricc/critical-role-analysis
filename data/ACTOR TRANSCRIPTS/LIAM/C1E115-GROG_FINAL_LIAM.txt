How did you do that without moving your mouth? It is soft. It's not one of those scritchy-scratchy scarves. It's soft. M & M, and you and I, Tal. Not Marshall Mathers. We meant Matt and Marisha. Couple things. Next week, Marisha will be in your chair, running a game of Honey Heist. We're all bears. They're not bears, but the three of us and everyone else who's going to be here are going to be bears. It's the worst episode for you not to be here. Look at these guns! Feel-good game of the year. Did you even know she was in the game? No duh! Also, tomorrow will be the first character playlist. It will be mine, so you can find it sometime tomorrow. You've got time! It'll drop sometime tomorrow. Madness! Yeah, episode two dropped on Project Alpha today. It's pretty great, it's pretty spooky. Like Tiny Vax, but tiny everybody, this time? That's drawn to scale, that one. Is there a ball involved in this game? A ball? Games are typically-- ball, a ball. Not that my father ever played catch with me, but you know, the type of ball that one would play catch with, with one's father, if they gave a shit. What kind of game is it, then? Vegan wine, yeah. This is the game? That's an odd story choice to make. The last of us. The dimensional distortion there for a second! I was just standing here! Yes, but wait one second. Grog, you're very good at this. Have you been spending time at the theater and not telling us? Let's fight this fucking guy! What do I do? Do I actually use this, or what do I do? Are we fighting? I would like to poke him in the eyes. These. All right, I'm going to use this weird-- I'm going to use this weird purple one, where you can't read the numbers on it. I think it says 13. And what? I think I'm improvising this weapon, is that accurate? All right, so I would add, I have no fucking idea. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to add my wisdom modifier. Why would I add anything? How strong are my fingers? Is that the point? Sure, I'll add my strength to my fingers. So 15. That's fucking hilarious. I have four of these. You threaten me all the time! Neither do I! This game thinks of everything. You're intelligent. Do you understand what is happening? I'm sorry, I know I keep slowing things down here, but in this imagination game, can we do anything that we do in life? Can we do things that we can't do in life? That sent a shiver down my spine. I would like to cast Faerie Fire. Yes I do. I had the craziest dream last night, Scanlan. Yeah. And then I died, and then I wasn't here, and then I was. And then there was like, three weeks where I was a father in this other city, washing dishes, and I had this "car." There were no horses but it was just wind. I had these kids. I don't know who these kids were. I'm going to save that for later. I'm going to put these away. Everybody seems to know what's going on. Grog-- not Grog, but Grog-- did we get any points? Did we win? I love the theater. But we're playing a game! I thought we were near the end of the game, but we're just getting started? It's a game! It's make-believe! We want to get fucked up! Bobaline, are you going to go down and get it and bring it up, or are you-- He's sending us to his basement. That's creepy! We will go with you, Grog, to the pig sty. I'm not going to the basement, because once, in Syngorn, a comic book shop owner tried to get me to go to the basement to look at comic books, and I'm not doing that. Yeah. So good luck in the cellar. Let's go see the pigs. I don't know whether to shit or go blind in this game. Intelligence, I'd think. Yeah, you have to know how locks work. What are those words you're using?! I didn't pay attention through any of school. I copied everything that she wrote down. What kind of role playing are we doing here? We're getting ale for our buddy, Grog. Got to keep the big man hydrated. Do you know how to sneak with dice? How do you do it? Okay. Night at the Improv, here we go. Neither one of us are very strong, can you do your handy thing? Yeah, I don't want to get all muddy and shit, could you just grab it from here? It seems to plebeian, don't you want to skip the hard work? Sure! I can make a purple hand! Can I make a purple hand? Why not? I thought it was imagination?! Is my fun wrong?! I guess it is! All right, well, show me how to handle a pig. I'm so confused! But we're right at the table! No, I got confused for a second because this is confusing. Yeah! I'm roleplaying a little bit today. You're going to grab the booze and carry it back with us. What did he get? I was daydreaming, but I guess. But you said there were no points and you got points? That's a fancy word! It's no mystery that Grog likes you better than he likes me, so-- What did he play? Do we feel hungover? Do we have all our shit? What are all these papers? Can I hide? I can? I'm going to hide. Do your thingy, though. You don't have to clap or-- What are these things? You've seen that before. Oh, I'm right at the crack! Of course. That guy looks just like you, Grog! He looks like me! That looks like Scanlan! That doesn't look like you at all. What, you got a fucking bear? Where did you get these toys? Also, I rolled a 39 for stealth. Is that good? Is 39 better or worse than 45? Jeez, Grog, you're inspired today. Well, hold on. We know that I like to stick my dick into things, so why don't I creep ahead and see what is happening? I'll roll this one with the book on it because I feel goodness from it. I got a 19 on that, plus perception. Oh my gosh, that's really good. 33 for perception. I didn't understand the rules! It's not as high as mine, I would like to point out, but I was facing the wall. May I turn around from the wall first? Can I use some sort of perception or insight or one of these numbers to figure out if we are in a room shaped like a cock and balls? Okay. I've got a total of 23, Grog. I'm a big fan of the show Stillben Vandal, it's quite good. I did burp. I love you too, Stubby. But slowly move up the shaft. I will follow behind Scan-Man. Yeah, you know, palm the sides as you go. I pull him back! What if I suck the poison out? Well, just on principle. Just on principle. Is that a lot? Is that all you have? I definitely should. Or I could use my paladin ability-- Okay, I'm feeling lucky, though. But it knocked the first die into a higher number, can I go with that? We've never played this game before! Not for the first time. So go again. Look at what I got! That's a good ass suck right there. 19, how did I do? I wave it away and then I take the opportunity to do one of these. (blows raspberry) You just made that up. Where did you learn this game? Every map has a dick in it, from here to eternity. I will start looking for traps up this shaft. Jump over that spot. Ooh yes. 36. I like to evade stuff like this, can I use some sort of evasion? I knew this was what this game would be. I knew it. Grog, I didn't see anything hit you, but I might better just suck poison out of your ass, just to be sure. I would like to see if there are any more traps before we get to the tip. Perception, which one is this? There's a picture of a monk on this one. What? What's initiative? That's a die, you're rolling a die. I had so many ghosts in that box over there, Travis. I brought six tubs of miniatures. So many miniatures. 16. What, what? Look at Grog on that board, looks like he's staring and judging the toys. A what? Bonus action? This is what all those ballet classes for Trinket were for, right now. I will run at the ghost. Right? Because I have to get up to it. I could throw, but where's the fun in that? So I run at the ghost, and I'm going to use Whisper, and I'm going to dagger, dagger, dagger. And I'm going to use the power of my deity and do something called Divine Smiting. I've never told you guys what it's called, but it's called Divine Smite. Yeah. So that's 33. Yeah, I rolled lower than the last time. Great. I jump across, run. How do I hit it with my knife? Okay. Okay, so I roll once. I'm going to use my-- I have endless luck. It's endless. That's a one. So instead I get a 19. It does? Oh my gosh. God, there's all these numbers on this piece of paper. I've used 17 lucks. It was a six. I'm not very good at math; I copied all of her answers. I think that's around 13, plus eight, 21, and then the Divine Smite, which I'm going to peg somewhere around 3d8. So a 31. That'll do. 38. That was a 42. 44. Grog, 44 points of damage. Feathers everywhere, David Bowie-style. Does it hurt the ghost? But I can attack so many times, Grog. Can I do another quickie? Is that how it works? What the fuck is that? A wisdom saving throw? Okay, so I don't have any of that. Oh, that's good. I rolled an 18. Let's refocus on the shaft. Just the tip, though, Percy. We should backtrack the way we came. Push it real good. That's the lowest number you can get on that thing. Just like life. I'm going to hang back at the tip of the wang there. Yeah. I don't want to leave. I don't want to go. I feel safe in the shaft. Eight tubs of minis. Eight tubs of minis. There's a die on the map. You're at disadvantage if you're right up against. I mean, I just feel like that's a rule. Must be like a rottweiler or something then because they're so mean. Not really. That's just a myth, isn't it? Maybe a chihuahua. It's probably a chihuahua. Have you played this with him before you played with us? Why didn't you let me sleep in with Keyleth then? Why am I here? Jeez. I want to fucking sleep in for once. Is it like the ghost piano at the Magic Castle? How far does this go? Oh look, isn't that clever! It's tits. Caverns. Okay we're doing it again, let's roll one of these little balls. 21. Okay, I click my boots. Do I have my boots? Always. Fuck yeah! I click the boots, and I bolt through, out the end of the penis and to the boobs, or the egg, or whatever it is. I go from the tunnel-- Yeah, the hallway into the cavern. The first round cavern that is identical to the next one. Painful stuff. Yeah, I'd like to run around between my sister and Trinket and get up into the grill of that first spiky dog, because I should have a better chance of hitting it because it's so preoccupied with my sister. Jeez. So I jump over here. So I bang like that, I can jump over Grog, and I go (whoop), right up in the middle like that. And then I stab. I'm going to roll twice. Because I'm feeling good. Ooh, that's good. 30. Oh, it does. Okay. So I roll this pointy one that's like a caltrop, and that's a two. And then I add eight to that, that's a ten. And then I roll again for psychic damage. That's 12. Look at all these in a box, oh my God, look at that. 14, eight, no. 25. 29. 32. 32, Grog. And then we all only get one attack per turn, is that right? I do, but before-- Yes. I have four more. Five more, seven more attacks. One more attack is good. It might be more, but we'll just do one more. That's a 31. Yeah. On that one, I'm throwing it, so that's not as crazy because I kind of blew my wad on the first one. That's a nine. A nine. How much did he do total? Were you here when I did, like, 30-something on the attack just before? It focuses on me, but it was talking to you. You must face Bavmorda. Vex, Vax, and Trinket? Oh. Oh, my boots are on, so I do better at that now. 21 for me. So what does he look like? Set the scene for us. But what am I subtracting that from? What health? I feel fine. Percival, what do I subtract it from? What are hit points? Is that over here somewhere? I mean, I can. Doesn't mean I do. That says my name, Vax'ildan-- Where? Oh, I got a lot. That's so many hit points. I bet I have the most in the group. So I take away, I think you said 14. Why do you decide for Trinket what Trinket does? But only since you met Vex. Just make it up, this is imagination. Did I get any points? Did I get any XP? So how it works is you have to get all the XP at the very beginning. The XB; what does the B stand for? Gently first, though. Maybe you should taste it. Sorbet? May I search the bottom of each nipple? That's what I said. Yeah. Like feel around, see if there's any loot. Well there's one right behind me. I should do the one closest to me. I'm going to see if there's any traps in there if I'm going to stick my hand deep into that thing. Of course. Oh, that's really good. I'm getting the hang of this. That is a 26. I love how automatic that was. He's got breath worse than a decrepit old dachshund, too. This is game of fantasy and imagination, so it's just going to open and not hurt us at all. This is a utopia! My own bathroom door in Whitestone hits me for one point of bludgeoning damage every time I use it. This door is faulty. Even if we didn't say we were going towards the door? I knew it was too good to be true. Vax'ildan rolled a 30. Freddie. Up top! Fucking dummies, right? Yeah, I'd like to wait and also to mull over who is this more painful for you, Vex'ahlia's husband and lover, or me, her oldest friend and twin brother. It's hard to tell. Grog, can you enlighten us? That's fine. While he studies the door, I'm studying Percival. Does he look more rugged and good-looking as his hair is blown towards the door, or less? Okay. I do a five-count One, two, three, four, five. And then I just go Motherfucker! And I grip my own shoulders and dive. The Pentagon. Is this Heaven? Can you be pwned? I also cannot be knocked prone. I can see them, though, right there. And is this also permanent marker? All right. Grog, may I use an action to stand up? Yes! That'll be my next action, to turn around. Seems wise. Oh no. I think you're supposed to keep what you know and what you don't know separate. That's called, what was it-- Mata-gaming. Mota-gaming? Meka-gaming. You can't Mega Man-game-- It's been about three minutes, I'd like to use another action to face the same direction as everyone else. Okay. The boots have worn off, so I can only roll this ball once. It's not very good. 14. Circle door. I know what that is. But that's Liam, not Vax. Yeah, they're very fisty. Ooh, Trinket is killing it! Irony. Na-na-na-na-na-na. You don't know. We don't know. Yeah, I'm right around the corner. We didn't hear oof, aaf, or the bear going (growling)? I feel like my twin sense would have kicked in. I'm running towards the sound of the sister. (growling) It's not coming from me at all, you're just imagining it in your brain. Okay so I'm going to throw Whisper and bamf to this motherfucker. At advantage. I'm getting the hang of this. That's a 28 to hit. Okay. Where the fuck is the four-- there it is. (counting) 44 for the first and a paladin attack, we'll go attack attack and I'll use my bonus action to attack-- One attack? Well that's how Flungeons and Kragens work. So one more attack. That is a 25 to hit. Which is a little bit less. That's a seven. Yeah. Yes. This is the most fun game! Regerts? Can you spell Regerts? Scanlan? No, not Scanlan. Scanlan. I'm out of vegan wine. Could you get some more vegan wine in, please? Thank you. You were dealing with a melted humanoid. I'll go to my circle. Circle door. You are a world-class performer. On free? Three or free? That makes sense, that makes sense. Dagger, dagger, dagger? Maybe three daggers? Three sides? Let's try it. Well, it matches the symbol for your home a little bit. De Roll-o. That's what it was all along. You are the richest, most powerful people in town. Who is looking down on you? It's a tree creature. It's like a medium pain reaction. Ooh! Yeah. I'll do all the same shit. I want to, before I check for traps at the door, perception check for anything-- Why'd I roll two? I don't know why I rolled two. I'll take the lower of them. 23. I do not understand this game, Grog! Jeepers creepers. Do I know what direction I sense the movement from? In front of me? Is it the rug or the chest? Hmm. What is this thing moving? Sam, wiggle your hand. Where's the movement? It's there. So I go over to this desk and open it. What does it have to do? I believe so. Sweet. (muffled) Can I say Jenga? Jenga! We have to do this? I will use a game to experience death. It will be enlightening. Mega Man is for cowards. Grog, you're breaking the verisimilitude. This is not my first time. Having my breathing snuffed out. A strength check? All right. I roll the round die. I'll roll the Grog one. That's a one. I'm going to use another luck. It's not. It's my third one, a-hole. I have four. The most important thing to me right now is to point out that my strength is 14, which is slightly above average, which is very different than your shit-ass seven, with a modifier of negative two. Does it roll to hit, or do I make a dex save? What did I just roll to do, though, Grog? I don't understand. That's very important. Is it important for me, though? I haven't breathed very much at all-- I would have been fine in there. Okay, so I take a bunch of damage, right? 21 points of damage, okay. Hey, I have 69 hit points. Nice. Are the hatches bars? There's a witch behind it. I thought you said you played GURPS in grade school. Sounds like a lot of something, of something. These scarves were a wonderful purchase for the group. They are so cozy. We need them in Vasselheim. Fuck the lot of you! My hands are free? I throw Whisper 15 feet out the door and bamf to where it strikes on the ground. Yeah, and then I will turn now-- it's up to you, Grog-- I'm going to use two daggers, if I can. Wait. I'm going to use my Vow of Enmity on the rug, and then I'm going to attack. I have zero points! (giggles) 31, and because my Vow of Enmity on this rug is in fucking effect, I get sneak attack damage, so that is two, plus eight is ten, and then we add some of that. 12, and these guys go, as well. (counting) 39 points of damage on the fucking Persian carpet. Hardwood floors are much fucking better. Fuck you. And I'm going to walk in and check out that chest. I'll grab the potion. I will use them to easily hop the 12 feet up, and then I will pull the wings in. Press the wings into the back of me, and slide and crawl my way up this tunnel. My wings are silky smooth. Guys, from my point of view, I can see Fletcher's Mill emblazoned at the base of the tower. I just imagined it! I wanted to pickpocket Scanlan so I could start Robbing Gibbons. Over a gibbon! A big 12. It is. Yeah, that'll hit. Okay, I'm going to pretend like the Deathwalker's Ward is set to fire. So halve that. Does not hit. Sidestep. Evasion for a dex save, uncanny dodge can halve one melee attack per round. Evasion only triggers if you have to make a dex save. Is it a JRPG, you're throwing mana? What are you checking, Grog? Do you have a book or something for this? Oh, you killed him! Celestial for unicorn. And your six seconds are up. You know that was like 87 seconds. All right. I regain one hit point as a revenant. So that's going to make all the difference. I use my action to cast a level one druid spell, Faerie Fire, on this flying fucker. It has to make a dex save versus my DC of 16. I did. Poof! Lit up like a disco ball, and I now have advantage on the attack against it so I can fucking sneak attack, which is going to be clutch. Right in front of me, and I will use my bonus action to throw a fucking dagger. Oh dear, that is a 23 to hit. Yes, it does, and it gets (counting), plus these guys. Jeez, that was a shitty roll. 33 and I'm going to dump my other level two spell slot for Divine Smite. 48 total from Whisper. It will, but I'm going to use my last luck. Roll again. Does not hit. Does hit. What's it hit me with? All right. Fire, so that'll be halved to eight? And then it might be four, I'm going to look something up really fucking quick. Uncanny dodge. I'm going to halve that down to four. Have you ever seen this unicorn before? The triceratops diddles his iPhone in the corner. There you go! I'm going to use a level one spell slot and cast Faerie Fire again on the illithid by Freddie. So it has to save versus a 16. I thought that would affect physical, not magical. All right, well then I will fuck this guy up in front of me then. That's a 23? 19, that's good. 36 total. And I'll just stick it out right in front of him. That was Sam as Scanlan as Scanlan as T-rex as bear. What, to fly into the wall over and over again? Okay, Colville, it's up to you. Not good. Eight-- 15. I don't understand this game! The rules don't make sense! Can I have some XBs, please? Can I have some XBs? Sure. Sure. What a good idea, to grovel. But which part of it? Just give me a number, Grog. You're the mathematician. Okay, I would've got back a hit point, because I'm a revenant. So that's 41, so I'm sitting pretty. Within five feet of where he was? (as Clarota) Go fuck yourself. I will use half my movement to stand. And then I will use the other half of my movement, which winged is 30 feet, and fly up to this asshole. And I will use a bonus action to down that potion that I grabbed, which is 4d4 plus four. So that's (counting) 14. And then I will stab this asshole in the asshole. That is a 33 to hit. All right, here we go. (counting) And then here come all the d6s. (counting) 44, and I will dump-- I'm good at math, I'm not good at whatever the fuck this game is. This is the best game, though. So it's in the high 40s, you made me lose track. I'm going to say 49. Yeah. Not much. That is 26 to hit. Seven, and I will dump my last spell slot in. 17. Slow dance down to the ground. Very quickly, covered in gore, Freddie and Vax nod. (sings Jurassic Park theme) Well earned. My wounds are starting to heal up somewhat. I would like, not in the game but out of the game, to hide. I'm hiding because you're going to murder our friend. You know, I have never seen you feed a single thing to that bear in all the time we've known you. What was your reasoning for feeding Trinket right now? He's always hungry, Scanman. If it's a doppelganger, we have to murder him together. Insight check for sure. Oh, that's terrible. Four. Come on, girl! Terrible. Stinkaroo. Seven. Rolled a two on the Matt die. This is Grog porn if ever there was any. Hit die! Too late. It's going to be the best. The best! I strike for four hit points of damage. Come on, one. One! Magic. Sneak attack damage. Did you already use it? We've got to kill him to be sure. Shank him, Percy. And to get while the getting is good. And I would like to shave the other side of Grog's face that I didn't shave that one time. Shave, shave, shave. It keeps growing back! Did you happen to catch this man's name? Cathew Verser. What a shitty combination. Can we do a sci-fi bent next time? Rifts or Shadowrun or cyberpunk? A do-ron-ron, yeah. It was very entertaining. Who won the game, though, Grog? Ten. Titties. Not titties? I don't know you anymore. That's the thumbnail image, right there. We will say lovely things. The scarves are the fucking bomb. They're so soft and cozy. Hey, good job with those three of my 400 miniatures, Travis. How lucky are my eight- and 11-year-old? Yeah.
