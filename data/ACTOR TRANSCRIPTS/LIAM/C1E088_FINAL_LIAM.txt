That's for building a thing, isn't it? Oh, that's cute. Yeah, they're all different. What do you got? What Lego did you get? You, specifically. Send all your complaints care of Sam Riegel. We are so proud. That's you. Twins. And in all your experience with these beasts, are their attacks mainly physical? Long ones. Manatees. The unicorns of the sea. This all she talked about from ages six to 13. Only thing. Look at our DM. Even that's a pretty big number for you. Oh, great. (garbled) Three hours of this. You put 'em away. Didn't you? Aren't they for close up? You don't want to lose them in the ocean. Maybe put them away? Just, just don't open it. Yeah. So, for example, daggers'-- -- short distance is 20 feet. I could throw it 20 feet at disadvantage. Gameplay wise, game mechanics. This is awesome! So you think if your bullets were to pierce out through this bubble, they could still go a ways. Yeah, I mean, fairy tales tell about them pulling ships under the water, breaking them in half. Does that negate all my class boosting and all that? What about these merpeople? I mean, don't knock it. Also, I know it's always been a waste of time, our planning, but we're not even talking about what we're going to try to do. Are we going to try to distract this fucker and take his lodes or-- Oh, shit. Question. I'm obviously a fan of stealth, right? But when we go in there and it all fucks up like it does nine times out of ten and the thing sees us anyway, what are we doing? Without the lodes? With the lodes? But we don't wanna hurt this thing, so what are we doing? Interference and distract and a couple of us try to smash and grab? Yeah. We do that and then we kind of take it like jazz on the day, you know? If it makes you feel any better, this feels less asinine than many things that we've done before. I once teleported into the belly of a dragon with another jackass and that went tits up fast. I'm still breathing. You know, just between you and me, this does sound really fucking stupid. Yeah. Who hasn't seen a drawing of a squid or a kraken in a fairy tale book? They're disgusting. As soon as those two start talking about that, I get out of the water and start attuning the Deathwalker's Ward to lightning. Right in the blubber. Change his alignment! (laughs) Frog sacs? Not a bad thought. Rider. This is the meal I was waiting on. That's extra hit points, yeah? How many? Roll for all of us. No fear, no poison, advantage on saves, isn't it? Wisdom saves. Welcome to the cool kids' table, Tary. Get the fuck out! (makes ding noises to mimic hitting glass dome) (gong noise) I do. (all laugh) I mean, that's funny, but it doesn't sound safe. That's not a bad idea at all. It's not just as flashy as the armor though, is it? Good idea, Grog. Scary fun. Well, I'm gonna follow Keyleth back to our room. You all right? No, I was waiting outside the door. I've seen the trouble behind your eyes all day, not surprisingly, yeah? Yeah? Okay. Long time coming. You know, you are already a river to your people. I know that your life has built up to this moment in many respects. But your father is very proud of you. You've already done a lot. You silenced that dragon. You've done a lot. You know, I know that you struggle with doubt, and I don't think it's ever gonna go away for any of us. Especially for you. I think that's part of the job you're getting ready for. But I don't see it as a weakness. You know, all this time I've remembered Uriel. I'm not big on monarchies and the like, but I liked him. Yeah. May his soul rest. And he had doubts. And he let them inform his decisions, and tried to do what was right. And the questions you have, I think they speak to your character. Well, all the matters is what we leave behind us when we go. You've already done a lot of good. And you've taught me to be happy again. I'm very grateful to you. So, thank you. You make that easy. Yeah. You know, I noticed, about a week ago? You were curious about my wings. I shoot them out. We have one hour. Fade to feathers. I don't think they went anywhere. Derp. I want to go to there. That's nice. Cool! That one looks like Keanu Reeves! And that one looks like Patrick Swayze! (all laugh) Oh, Jesus. Hopefully the whole time. And gameplay mechanics, can Trinket get walloped so hard that it passes all of his new form, plus Trinket form, and take him out? So, riders, show of hands. Rider, rider? What do you want me to do with these? Just keep them safe? Okay. All right, Freddie. He does speak Fucking-with-you. Very well. Hi. My name is Vax. That's short for Vax'ildan. From you, yes, I have. It's a good tale. That is my sister. Her name is Vex'ahlia. You can call her Vex. Some people call her Vax. I walk away. (all laugh) Just finished going up the ropes and down. Nice. To the rift? Wait by the gate. Like a butler. Love you, Matt. The magic of improv. That is a lot of steps. Eh. How many Grogs? Like ten Grogs long? Hundred Grogs long?! And you've seen it leave these stones, these lodes? I have never felt more prepared than I do right now. Let's do this shit. It smells like poop? (shouting, away from mic) What, we're on, now? Holy cow. You just opened your eyes? I'm using Divine Sense right now to see if anything is not completely-- Undead. In the bones. DM snark! And krakens, it says right there-- Aberrations. If it's not an aberration-- It'd be a beast which you don't have-- The only thing on there-- The only thing on there-- that it is maybe is an aberration. I mean, elementals-- There's nothing on this list. They're all around us, man. Tary's armor. A killer whale, we talked about. Yeah! Killer whale Trinket man. He's having a singular experience for a bear, though. I just (mimes scratching Trinket). Fucking D&D, man. Yeah, add that ten, man. 38. It's all I do. He's just underwater ballet-ing, man Not making a sound. Gently. I thought it was one of these. Get some butter from the jug. I'm going to join Keyleth as well. C-20. (all laugh) No, plus ten. Good job, Gil. I start scootching him behind the ear, I know this one spot behind his left ear that calms him down, as I watch with Keyleth. Mixing in with the black sand. Like a squid in his own right. They don't have fuck all. Natural 20. 45. Natural 20. 45. See ya, mothafuckers! Two in a row? Wow. (sings) Telling a story! Aw, the humans. Aw. 24. Uh, when shit is exploding in your face? The inside of his mouth is so pretty (muffled yelling). Jeepers creepers. I'm clicking the boots of haste. And I am casting Bless on myself, on Keyleth, and on Grog. 30 feet. You are blessed. It means on attacks or on saving throws, you can roll a d4 and add that for a minute, for the whole battle, basically. Yeah. I'm going to-- I'm 45 stealth, I'm going to back away to behind those giant shells. Mm-hm. So I'm gonna swim over that way. And I'm hasted, so action, action, I should have a bonus action, yeah? So I'll hide, if I'm not hidden already. Good, 35. That loud, though? d4, d4. (laughs) Oh, yes! I did too! (all laugh) 22, plus I'm set to lightning with the Deathwalker's Ward. Halved twice, I should be quarter, right? If I made the save? Oh I didn't make it? 22 didn't make it? Oh. #Bless bless bless. Finger guns. Totally in-character. Rogue! Jeebus. I'm gonna use Luck. All right. 15. Shite. Trinket kraken. Trinket kraken. Oh my gosh. Who? Stop. Tary time. Oh my god. Shit. What'd you say? I'm going to start-- who's the closest of all the people grappled to me? Grog, all right. I'm going to start swimming there over the shells. And I'll blow-- And I'll use my bonus action for more movement. Yeah. Okay. And I'd like to use Whisper to tear into the tentacle holding him to try to get him free of it. To un-grapple him. Yeah. Athletics check, goddammit Matt! Plus-- that's shit. Shit. Luck. 11. Okay. I'm out. I've been in a dragon. Wise as fuck. (zapping noise) Six, Deathwalker's Ward. Good gravy. Yeah. Your accent is showing. Yeah. (Southern accent) You're talking like that. Little bit. (Southern accent) Alter Self. Bless. 27. Yeah. Pirouette. It's fun, isn't it? Attack with disadvantage. Bless. Bless roll. Bless roll. Make that big roll. But it's like-- Yeah. Okay. Oh. The twins like. Hey. Just keep yanking that out. Lot of rules. Okay, I'm gonna use Disengage to kick away from this big fucking thing and start-- I'm hasted, so I should be able to get to Keyleth. And she's grappled, correct? I'm just gonna start cutting. So, try to do what I did with Grog before. So, athletics, you said? Attack roll. I'm gonna use my last Luck of the day. Because that was a one. I ignore and I keep cutting. 16, 29, that's very high. 31. Right. Because even though she's grappled, it's still way far away. All right, so, where the hell-- two, plus ten-- oh boy. That's 15. Yeah. I've got one more attack, so I'll keep going then. All right. This is venom. That's 24, plus-- Okay, good, plus nothing. Where the hell do I keep putting my dice? Where's a four? Where's a fucking four? There it is, plus four is ten. I'll unload some poison in it, that's a DC 15. Okay. Is it halved then, or nothing, for the poison? It doesn't say anything about halving it. So I guess that means zero. So ten, for the second. God damn. Yeah. That's the end of my turn. Not a wisdom save. Same. You just got chat roomed. CR. Edge-of-your-seat action from Critical Role. For 80-something episodes, yeah. Rogue shit, yo. Fucking meatbag, getting knocked around all the time. Oh jeez. Ooh, buddy, what are you doing? The dungeon master is giddy tonight. Hey, don't eat my girlfriend. I just got her. Seven minutes in kraken. Let's not get-- Let's shift to the fire realm. Fuck. Like castor oil? It greases you up. Sweet. All right. I have just gone-- I have just gone whiter-- My face has gone whiter than it has since I became a paladin of the fucking Raven Queen, seeing Keyleth just get swallowed up, but I am going to trust that Grog and she are going to get themselves out of there, and I am going to look to where Keyleth pointed, and try to see a lump or something, in the sand. Okay, I made a-- hold on, 18. Is that one action? Because I have an action and a bonus action, so I'll just do as much as I fucking can to dig this fucker out. I'm hasted. The hasted action is only a weapon attack? Okay. Fucking hell. I can't do anything, I can't do anything. No, I mean I'm on concentration for Bless and they're both in there and they probably fucking need it. I'm done. I'm done. Oh shit, 22. No. Hits me. Oh, uh, hold on. Two. What's 28 to hit? Nah, wouldn't hit 28. Never mind. 'Cause I'm blessed but it's not much-- Oh, good. Jackpot. Dex save at disadvantage. Kraken's gonna get burning squirts. But, everyone on the outside just goes-- Bless! Kraken for kraken. 19, Deathwalker's Ward Is Keyleth-- Is Keyleth still grappled while unconscious? Shit. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Yeah! Don't do that, Marisha. Monstrosity. 16. 16 and Deathwalker's Ward. Oh, and if I fail dex saves it's half damage, so I'm getting quarter damage right now. If I succeed, it's nothing. If I fail-- I failed, it's halved. Plus the Deathwalker's, so down and down. That's a number. Madman, love it. Okay, I take Whisper out, and I'm throwing it at the ground ten feet away from you right next to Keyleth on the ground, and bamfing out of its tentacle to it. (gurgling noise) 23. Plus Grog is whaling on its head, so I'm going to Sneak Attack the tentacle that's holding Keyleth. Yeah? 34. Okay, and I will-- I can't use a bonus action to pull her, right, that's too much, yeah? Yeah. I will use a bonus action to stand over and in front of her. While you were out. Killer whale, man, killer whale. Be whales, get the fuck out of here. Okay. Eels, we're eels. Eels. Keyleth is not. You are, and I am. We gots to be immune, man. Winging it. Feels good! But only because you are. Who hasn't gotten punchy at the end of a long D&D game? This is real D&D. You went British again. Stupid kraken. Oh, no. I thought he was being nice to us. He was just being nice to us! He's tired! 5.9, 6.2, 6.3-- Hey. Fish porn. Okay. A what to hit? Oh okay, do I not have-- am I hasted? Do I still have advantage on my dex saving throws? As an eel? So it's, 'cause I'm blessed as well-- oh, it's a 32. Oh, it's an attack roll. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. What did it roll? Sorry, I thought-- Oh it definitely hit. Yeah, I'm sorry. Got it. Aw. 'Cause it smacked the shit out of me. I'm sorry, Matt, what was the hit point damage? There's so much shit-- You turned us into eels. I just got whacked. It's all right. We're both sad. 21. So the fail means I take half damage. Plus the Deathwalker's Ward, so quarter damage. I haven't made a constitution save in a while. My turn? I'm just going to repeat what I did before. Attack-- To a quarter. Six. Is it on me now? All right. Keyleth is adjacent to me, right? On the ground? Okay. So I'm going to use my first action to cast Lay On Hands and dump five hit points into her to wake her back up. Next action is going to be to throw Whisper into the ground again. And bamf to it. And I'm going to use bonus action to back up fucking 30 feet towards the big-- yeah, towards the portal. Yeah, backing up. Oh, that hits. Yeah. Uncanny Dodge. Okay. Halved to ten or 11? Mother bitch! It's got some long-ass tentacles. Yeah. I was just at the edge of its range and it snagged me. Back towards the kraken? -- wooden structure? Whale it, dude. I remember that bag. So pretty. Son of a bitch. 18. Ooh. Yeah. What's your character's name? Where'd the Key-whale go? Love you! Frickin' lasers. Shit balls. 28. Wait-- I'm Blessed! Oh, fuck a duck, I thought I was doing it in-- a Dex save. Then it got me. Sure. Uncanny Dodge. Okay. Okay. Get out, get, go. Yes, one of us will live! Who lives, who dies-- LIAM, MARISHA AND It's too late! It's done. Jeez. Yeah. No. Yes. Van Damme splits, just out of the way! Okay. See ya later, guys. Mm-hm. Is that at all connected to dexterity? No. Okay. It's all right. I'm out. Yeah, you got loose. Plus your wisdom modifier. 17 plus. Yes. The range. The range of Grasping Vine. It's hard to see on the screen. Roll a d20. But you would have 20-- You were at five. You couldn't have been at zero. Oh, to seven to get to 12. LAURA and Oh, it just goes. Okay. Getting intense? Jesus. Take that fucking potion. Take it. I'll be back. It's like a nicotine patch. Good. So that's two? Yeah, it's midnight. True love's kiss? I just mean Sam. Again. You're gone, you're gone. You're chill with me. Fuck you, kraken. Whew! Hashtag no more blessed. Scanlan appears in a purple puff of smoke! She's with us. You just bamfed us out. Tary! Come on, girl. Get out. That's the title for the episode. Wow. Holy shit. Love this game. You don't know that. Red Bull. May be my last death. Wow. Wow!
