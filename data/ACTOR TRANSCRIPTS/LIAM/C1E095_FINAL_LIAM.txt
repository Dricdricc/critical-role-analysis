I went to Catholic school! They're soft like the hoodie. They're like a thin version of the soft hoodie. I am not cool, so you are not talking about me. Oh yeah? So you can hear about all my artsy-fartsy theatrical sad hangups from the past? Oh joy, guys! Yeah, MomoCon is just fun to say. MomoCon. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh! Narrowed it down. Hum a melody. This is the whole episode. Show and tell! Summer vacation! Did you get a bear ass on your bare ass? I mean, he's either changing this guy's life for the better, or murdering him. This is the first of ten guys. Some go back, and some-- Now the Deck is slightly shittier. Who was that man? That was Taliesin Jaffe, Mayor of Ren Faire! Two-hour combat scenario. Probably thinks he has three birthdays a year, right? So. Farts. Farts. So many shit rolls. Everything's going to start to get a little intertwined here now. Yeah, yeah. So, overarching theme is, there was a lot of Zephra and chill. (laughter) I'm still learning the lingo. Getting to know Korren a bit more. Keyleth helped me-- I let a lot of blood and made a small altar to the Raven Queen in Zephra and it's been all flowered and vined out. And while we spent most of our time-- Oh, tattoos, want to talk tattoos? We went together. Yours took much longer than mine did. Yeah. Yeah, and about two-thirds of the way through yours, they started on mine, which is just a pair of antlers on the right bicep here. I did. Not on my face. Yeah. Keyleth for life. So we spent a lot of time in Zephra, but since have-druid-will-travel, we met up with these two quite a bit. About once a month, we would have three- or four-day weekends. We'd spent time in Whitestone. We went to Vasselheim a lot. The twins spent a lot of time in the library. Reading a ton. I spent a lot of time at the Raven Queen's temple, getting to know the people there, getting to know what the hell a cleric or a priest or a paladin of the Raven Queen does, since I didn't really have any time to do that. I tried to do a little observing, too, in Zephra as well. I didn't want to interfere with their customs, but it's like working at a funeral home, and over time you just get used to it. A couple of bits and pieces. I saw everybody, really. I went on a man's weekend with Grog and killed things, that was awesome. Talked a lot of shop with Pike. God talk. The girls went off on their own a little bit, so I spent time trying to figure out what it was Percival does in his workshop. He lent me a book about the history of Whitestone. It's beautiful, once you're not screaming, running on fire, you can really take in art and pass notes. Also tried to locate Dr. Dranzel in an effort to find Scanlan, but was unsuccessful. Yeah, and kept it down. Are we married? Yes or no. (laughter) Oh, and last thing, Vex took me to Syngorn on one of her trips. Spent some time with little sis. Not as much time with Dad. Some time with Dad. We're all right. It's fine. In character, in character. You know, elfs going to elf, and there's no getting around that, so. Girl better appreciate. Unnecessary bodyguard, yeah. It's Puddin'. That's Cervex. (sings) The fuckin' Theatre. Do tell, Matt. Aliens! This is their most sacred ceremony or something? I don't. Who are 'they'? The 'Unseelie court'? Well, listen, man. If I can't have the arts in my life, I'd rather be dead. They looked like Slendermen. Did you catch a whiff of Galdrick out in woods? Our hero! How wide is the hole? You told me one other thing. Did that get jettisoned? Are we all getting any prezzies? I've read about them. And I will start telling you about it. (AOL voice) Goodbye. Yeah, where are they best affixed to wear our bling? Okay. Nipple piercing. Profiterolos! You're fun to fucking drink with. Also, I am not always wearing the Raven Queen's armor. I'm wearing some of Percival's loaner cast-of-Hamilton clothing right now. I, on the break, built a trapped box to slide under the bed so that I can let my skin breathe at night. I smell lovely. Barely any hair on this body. (laughter) A little nostalgia in that for you, yeah? And show us all the best gifs. That's okay too. That's okay too. As close to the beach as possible. Oh my gosh! A couple of weeks? We should be so lucky. Are you going to do the thing? Your thing. The thing you do. (laughter) Yeah. Ultimately our time is worth far more than our money, so-- let's just go with that. All right, all right! (laughs) We don't need to go anywhere. This is it. Yeah, I'm already peeling off my shirt. Oh yeah? I've got my shirt up around my arms. What's up, buddy? (laughter) Well, my sister has locked you up, it's true. Oh yeah? Do tell, motherfucker. Oh. My. Fucking. God! (laughter) You beautiful fuck! Slap! Let's go get in the fucking water! And I run off towards the beach. Let's do it! Let's do it! Oh yeah. I want to go! 26! 26. 26. All right, I'm okay at that. Not today, though. I'm not burning Luck on this. I'm not burning it on this. 13. Do you want this? I don't. You can have it. By the way, I should probably toss out, because we probably haven't all been half-naked together-- you know this, some of you have, but not all of us together-- I still have this big mark in the middle of my chest. This black, veiny thing. FYI. He just evolved. Everybody looks over and Castle Ravenloft is towering above the beach. While that is happening, may I hide Taryon's clothing? Time is loosey-goosey. Aren't we playing Dungeons and Dragons here? It's up to him. 23. I'm getting him. Sleight-of-hand check? Natural 20! Yoink. And by the way, I went to the front desk and I asked which room Mr. de Rolo was staying in, because I wanted to put some of his belongings there, and I hid the armor in Percy and Vex's room. Sure. Here's where the Luck is. Yeah. Persuasion, you say? Deception. That's a 20. And now I'm coming back to the beach. Tary, come here. While you were messing about with Grog, Percy grabbed your shit and hid it. Yeah. He was chortling the whole time. All right. I walk away. You're like a Swiss army knife of fixing all our problems and trolling. "Kill them all, you say?" That's all right. Not the magical items. I'm in my room. Did you say you're coming to the room? I mean, practically. Kiki, might want to go to into the bathroom. I think that my sister is coming. Whoa! I guess I will as well. Yoink. What? What did I do in your room? Why would I destroy your room on the first day of our vacation? I wouldn't. What are you talking about? Dogs? Are you pranking me? What are you talking about? (yells) What are you doing? Do what? You have to be more specific. What the fuck are you talking about? Dogs? I don't have any dogs. I don't have any magic. I can heal a little bit and that's it. What are you talking about? I'll make my deception check. Yes, it was. I was not in your room. I am not lying to you, I don't-- (yells) What are you-- what? I click my Boots of Haste! This is improvisation. If I say it, it's real. That's how this fucking works. I'm running in my boots! Disengage. Yeah. Okay. You want to make it a strength check? I know my strength is double hers. Okay. Oh, acrobatics, okay. Well, I will choose acrobatics. 29. Fucking wicked, man. I'm double-speed, so 60. All right. 30. I see food trays left by other customers. I start knocking them down and dumping food on the rug behind me as I run. It's improv. It's real! I said I saw food! What's around me? Little busy, little busy, little busy! I immediately start doing this. This is me rubbing his tummy. You hear from under the bear, (muffled) I have been here before, and I will be here again! Did I ruin it? What did I ruin? I still don't know what happened. I did not fucking let two dogs-- I was there for five seconds. I put Taryon's armor under the bed and then I left. I was in there for 30 seconds. I don't have any dogs. I don't know dogs. Because it was fucking hilarious! I did. What happened? That's the funniest bit, because I have no money. Yeah. When she's gone and it's just us, I say, she thinks I care. I don't care. Does she let you kiss her? No, she doesn't. But you get to kiss me all you want, so have at it, buddy. It's all right. I've been inside a dragon's fucking stomach, buddy. I don't care. The beach is 50 feet that way. Get it all out. You fucking made out that you were hiding in crystal clear bathwater, motherfucker! If you say it, it's real! I'm hearing all this over the earring, and I whisper, only to Trinket I'm back, Trinket. I'm back. (laughter) Your clothes and bullshit is fine. Over their earrings, they hear, he also dropped a loaf. Do you improve the reception by moving it around? Man, that was pure Dungeons and Dragons. I took a little pebble and dropped it and it turned into a frigging avalanche on the side of Everest. You can roll a 20. Coming in. 20, we don't pick a card. 20 is sensible. One is ridiculous. They both want to do it so bad. The question is, do we want to? A cart of the Sackville-Bagginses just rolled up. I'm sorry. What brings you fine folk into town? Are you just visiting Pike here? I just want to get a vibe on them. I want to do an insight check and see what I think of them. Oh, jeebus. Crap. 13. I'm hooking Kiki by the arm. Hey, you've got that look in your eye. But you think they're a little bit hinky? That's a yes. Not quite big enough. (laughter) "I guess that silverware wasn't so important." Tary, you have Luck! It's a book. The whole top row is reserved for Matthew. That's Grog taint. Random question. Do we see an obvious family resemblance with Pike and any of them? 24. Facial features, I mean. Smooth as butter. You are very different from them. They are quirky. Why did Pom-Pom take you out of there? And older than all of them. They just got here, but what's your feel on this? You don't know that. Oh, that's right. We trust you, and Wilhand raised you, so Wilhand must have his head screwed on straight. That's where I was going. Is there any merit in trying to get a hold of Wilhand right now, while they're here? Yeah. I don't think they're going to burn down the castle. Do you remember our conversations with Wilhand when we were in Westruun? They were a little squirrely. No, he's older than that. Even as an outsider, that seems a little ugh. Or you could assist Grog. You know, the Grand Poobah needs an assistant. It's only befitting of your station that Percival aid you in such a fashion.
