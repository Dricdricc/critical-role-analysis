It was sweet and offensive. By the way, Sam, that's a very handsome hoodie you're wearing. I can't wait to open you up like an advent calendar later. Those characters are going to be awesome. I was not prepared. Oh! I'm fired, aren't I? Am I able to make a jello shot of invulnerability and haste at the same time? "I guess I'll go back to sleep now." I can't, we're into initiative, right? It's too late for potions. I'll do it. I got 11, plus what? 12, and Pike got 11. While we're cowering here, Pike says, "Guys, I think I could really help you out if you wait a "second. Okay?" No, it's not. She did this once and wrecked our enemies. It's worse than that? Are there any fires left burning in the vicinity? Our pores are cleared-- the steam-- So is he. I do. I don't understand all this arcane terminology. I like to think of all of Vox Machina nervously laughing. 24. So I take zero, because I'm using Evasion. As she rushes past, she hears (slowly) Those are just a loaner! I am going to down the potion of healing with a bonus action. And then now I have two actions because of the potion-- No, no. Haste. So that's bonus action, now I have two actions? Because of the potion. Second action's used to pump out the wings. Then I am going to fly directly towards Thordak's face to-- you don't need that-- to ten feet away from him to his face. you can just hold it for a second, and cast Vow of Enmity at him. And then I am going to barrel roll back, fly, and land hard right down next to my sister where she's hiding. 120, hasted. He could have taken a swipe at me. I'm just glad he didn't. Can I Uncanny Dodge this? Yeah. I have to. I knew it was going to happen. No, 17 plus 16 total. Okay. So eight and 17. 25. Gives me advantage on every attack. I will get sneak attack on every attack whether there's someone next to him or not. Inside. Squished into the corner. Okay. I'll mark that off. So anyone within 30 feet of her is getting some nice things. And the best part-- When someone heals you, you don't roll. You calculate the maximum amount you could possibly roll. So, DM. Who all gets that? Looks like Grog is just out of reach of it? Percy needs it? Grog needs it? Check out the big hand on Scan. Pull out your dragon gun. Nice. Actually not bad. Pretty good. This makes me happy. This is going to be funny. Is Thordy La Forge poisoned there? No disadvantage. I really just wanted to say Thordy La Forge. Clarota, is that you? On a flying steed. Keyleth is on The Price is Right. Double all the dice. They should really just do it already. Evasion! On this round? It's once a round. This is a whole new round. Okay. At advantage, because of those boots, man! 23. Did we fail the save? So I take zero. Happens to everybody. Thanks Pike. We're so glad you're here. Come on, Shaun. His AC is high, so ditch the handicap. Hey, Thordy, eat a dick. How about acknowledge it? Ancient dragon wasn't enough, huh, Matt? 25. Should I go, or should Kima go? Bonus action, I'm taking the potion of invulnerability. Next action, I cast Hunter's Mark on Thordak. Then I fly at Thordak's face and strike at him with the dragon-slayer sword. (cheering) At advantage. Good. 26 hits. So this is dragon-slayer sword plus Sneak Attack, I'm going to Smite and Hunter's Mark. Yes, all the attacks. Okay, nine plus six is 17, plus-- 18, 19, 21, balls. 21, okay plus the Sneak Attack. 27, 29, 33, 39, 40, 42, 44, plus the Hunter's Mark, 45 total. No, no. Now we're at 50. That's done. So I don't know exactly how far it was to his face and I know I'm all out of moves and I'm open to getting bitten again, but I want to fly away from his face as far as I can and land opposite everybody. Maybe near the lip. No, behind the building behind him. 120 feet of movement. Curve over his, oh, no-- sword's in his head? My friends are going to fucking kill you today, you fuck! Arc over his head. No. I'll slam down, if I can, behind the building behind his big fat ass. I didn't disengage. Working on it, working on it. "That doesn't look normal." Just dish out damage. So Legendaries can fall whenever they want? "Oh, Grog!" And it'll keep going. I say wait, because she's doing her job. She's keeping Grog alive. At max. It would have hit the fucking dragon. It's there for 50 years. Spider-climb is cool. This is a busy battlefield. Don't worry, sir, we didn't see you playing with your dolls. Man, Groggy. 17 displacer beasts just appear. Yeah. Sneak attack, on top of that. Got him, got him. That's 26 plus... is 27. Yep. Yes, I am using the sword. Yes, where is my ten-sided die? Ten plus six is 16. Plus all of this shit. 16, 17, 23, 29, 33, 34, 38, 42, plus Hunter's Mark. 43. I already did that. Correct. 43, thank you. 49. 50. 51. Too many Krispy Kremes. Here's Jenga, right here, that dragon's coming down. Holy cow. It's like Mousetrap. Holy cow. Oh my gosh! We'll use the theater of the mind, Matt! 19. Her modifier, so, a total of 20. Pike is going to be looking out for Pike on her next turn. Got to have that ray of sunshine, man. Do it. It's really on Matt for there being no pee break. Vax's turn. I'm going to fly straight at Thordak's flank. You can put me, well, don't actually put me there, because he'll topple. But I'm going to attack twice, once with the dragonslayer sword, once with Whisper, so here's the dragonslayer sword. Natural 20! (cheering) Yeah. But this is the sword. He can't against damage, can he? Yeah. So seven. I'll save the bonus for later. Seven plus the three. Seven, eight, 14, 18, 18 plus all of this. And I'm smiting, by the way. 18, 21, 24, 26, 30, 32, 35, 39 plus Hunter's Mark is 42, plus Divine Smite-- 46. 48 times two is 96. Without the bonus, so a hundred and... two. For the second attack-- good, this is, yeah, it hits, 16 plus, 20, 20, 25. This is Whisper, so that is one plus-- is nine plus psychic damage... No. Hand, hand. 16 for Whisper. And I will use my last action, so that was action, bonus action-- last action to disengage and fly down and land by Kima and Gilmore, this side of the building. Closest to me. On the ground, even, if I can, yeah. Behind the column in the corner by Gilmore's head, I think. Pretty sure I just had an orgasm. (laughter) Take it, take it. Pike cheat sheet, here we are. She was low. Somebody gets an inspiration die. (laughter) I really like this spider-climb guy. Yeah, evasion for me. With advantage. 18 for me. I'm sitting pretty. I mean, I'm really rough. I am Borishnakoffing all over this battlefield. The last thing we'll do in this fight is all turn on you. Go, girl. Legitimately though! Matt, why would you! Why would you! He's hesitating. Oh no, it's this die. Big eight, big eight. You shut your pie hole! Hear me, half-elf? Other side of that building. I can't see where Vex is at all. Ditch the broom. Pop his head off in one shot. Go. 6d10. I'm up. I'm going to arc up and land on his head. I'm just going to unload all three action, action, bonus action, into his head. First attack probably misses, that's 17? Second attack hits. That's 24. Third attack with the dragon sword is a 22. So, with Whisper. (counting) That's 45 with Whisper. And then with the dragonslayer sword. Eight plus six plus 3d6. So 21. What did I say before that? LAURA and So 21 plus 45 is-- So 66. And I will stay there. Sorry. Also, four for Hunter's Mark on the second attack as well. Girl. So many levels. All the levels. Pike cheat sheet. Five! Plus 1d6 every level above second level. So 3d6. You can do it, Pike. All the way from New York City. He is Groot. The whole face comes off. That's love. What are you saving it for? Give the people what they want. Here comes the gnome. Am I electrified, sitting on his head? Do it again, Percy. (laughter) No. Nope. Nope. Hasted, 23, fuck you. Not you. Not like this. I'm going to use Luck. Yeah. Good time to use Luck. 26. Would this be a new round for me to use Evasion? I've lost track. It's fucking end of the world! That'll do it, won't it? I'm riding him. Yeah. Shit yeah, I'm riding him. I'll use my last Luck. So it's a 15. So I'm in there with him. That is a 25. Do I still see him with darkvision at this point? Are we still in the same chain of initiative? How far away from me is he? 60 feet. Then I am going to use my movement and go 120 feet, or until I see him. This is just my movement. 120 feet or until I'm on him. Yes, I'm flying. Still away from me? Then I'm going to use a bonus action to dash and hit his back, and land on his back. Attack, attack. First attack is a-- scheisse. 24. I don't remember-- oh, I don't get the automatic sneak attack? But I got advantage? All right, so 24 for the first. 24. Second one is a natural 20. So the first one's the dragon-slaying. Three, eight, 14, 19, plus Hunter's Mark. So there's no sneak attack on this, right, you said? 21 with the dragon-slayer. And then Whisper, which is a natural 20, is one plus that is nine, plus the-- six is 15, plus Hunter's Mark. 17. Oh. 15 times two is 30. 30 plus eight. 38. With Whisper, I'm going to shove it in so that my hand disappears from view, so I'm up to my forearm, and stab as far in as I can reach. I hear the voice of my mother in the morning. Fuck you. 25. Which is also halved by the potion. Is that the quarter? She's doing great. She's in Manhattan. 17 sounds like 18. Crazy Eddie prices? Yeah, man. Thanks for that. Yeah, what now? Keyleth. This is the Jarett we know. He caught my sister's attention, anyone that does that has got to have a lot of spunk. Keyleth? You tell me. You tell me. Hit or wait? What? I'm going to hold my turn until Keyleth acts. Attack. I'm attacking her. She acted, she said don't touch, I said I'll base it off of Keyleth, so I'm attacking. I'm going to interrupt that. No. If I've heard don't let her touch him, and she's doing that, those two things mean the same thing to me. She's doing something. Yes. Dexterity check? All right. And I'll use my last Luck of the day. I had two. So that's a 28. This is everything. How far away is she from me? All three attacks. Okay. Move? I don't need to move. How far away is she, you said-- 20 feet. So I can throw daggers at her, right? No, but I have lots of daggers. I still have the Flametongue Dagger, which is not attuned, it's just a lame old dagger. First one is a 23. Second one is a 19. Third one is a 29. God. I don't remember. 23 sounds familiar. So two of the three hit? So it was hit-miss-hit, right? I think so. All right, so the first one is Whisper. Four plus eight is 12, plus psychic damage is 15, but there's no sneak attack, because there's nobody near her, and the Hunter's Mark-- Oh! Can I move Hunter's Mark to her at this point? I have no idea. It's a bonus? Okay. Got it. Okay. So 15 for the first and the second one. Oh, I don't need that. Is nine. 15 plus nine. And I'll use my movement to move between my sister and Raishan. Okay. We've seen Pike do it. You're not here. You're not walking away from this field. You're going to die. Maybe I will too, but you are going to die. Out of sight? I'm sure she was just going to ask about cooking recipes. It's fine. Go for it. Five, four, three, two... Forward. Yes. 31. 31. 31. 25. What did we have to beat? Zero. I got you, I got you. Doesn't matter, I can fly 500 feet, I got you. Lay on Hands, dude. No, shut up. I will kill you in the parking lot. She just blew her wad, she's done, we got a dragon and a flute. We should have just let her do what she wants, summon the most powerful thing in the universe.
