She could have gone skiing and just gotten a sunburn here, like this. How many dice are you able to build a night? I mean, that's what the wait is for. How-do-you-want-to-DOUKEN! You were not able to attend Critmas. But you were sent something very specific by a huge list of Critters. I will get that in a second. We haven't looked at it. Right now. There could be something so foul on it, we don't know. This is a quick one. It's an itty-bitty Doty. I sold Travis's gifts. Five dollars. Teach me how to sports. Just like rehearsal. Whee! [dramatic music] It's one of those videos where the guys are waiting with the big exercise balls to just wing them there. You have passed through fire. Retcon. Do you want to do the talking and I'll keep an eye on hands? It's quite an aesthetic. It could also potentially be bullshit. What are you saying? Life is not a book! Is Trinket here? Trinket, breakfast, right around the little guy there. Go on. Free food. He's not talking to himself. We all have earrings, he's talking to the others. If you were wondering. Are you coming with, buddy? Do you want to go on the tour? Huh. Can we borrow Trinket for that? Oh, Vex isn't here. I'm sure we could borrow Trinket for the day. You ever ridden a bear, old man? The bear's funnier, though. Hello? Oh, I'm right here. Are we not actually in the castle right now? Go ahead. I thought I'd get you a bear ride, but I was wrong. I'm sorry. Yeah. Can we get three beers in here? There you go. Three beers for you, Grandpa. Oh, shit. Well, we're all gonna die. Have another one. Man, I couldn't do that. The Grand Poobah tour? Yes, you are. Well, this calls for a celebration. A very wise man once said that life needs things to live, so. Oh, shit! First Vex, now you! All of This and That! Jeez, that hat is busier than K'Varn's whole fucking-- Ding, ding-a-ling, doodle-ding! Yes, it's no bear, but it's pretty good. Of the Grand Poobah and myself? The carpet's above my station. As we head out, I run over to Keyleth and say, try not to be too jealous! And I give her a smooch and then I chase after the gang. Oh, I will! My plan is to act casual but to be watching all the gnomes for thieving things. Do we get to see the Musketeers? Well, I will. Let's go! Oh, he turned around. (laughter) And soft like the hoodie. We said we were gonna do Firecracker Alley. See the Musketeers. Can we do that? I really want to do that. Well, I'll hush up around your sister, but it's just us right now. Kynan. How many rifles are we looking at, here? Queen's Grace, that's a lot of guns, Percy. Kynan-- Hey. Hey, it's been months. You're looking on point. Yeah. That's old history. How are you getting on? Are you being of use? Well, that's enough. (whispers) How's Simon? Sometimes I sound like my sister. I'm sorry. I just like equality for all. (whispers) Can I say hello? Oh, fuck! Buddy! Can I hold him for a minute? Ah. Hey! Hey! You are bigger. What is he feeding you? What are you feeding him? Well, I fed him. I mean, you don't have to, I guess. When was the last time this belt was a snake, before now? I'm conflicted here. I did give this to you-- Can I insight check Simon to see how he's feeling? Hey, this is all bullshit, man. That's insight? No, I'm gonna use wisdom. Excuse me, I'm going to use Luck. Oh, that's much better. That's 18. Kynan. You are happy here-- happier here? I'm very glad for that. You seem happy. And everybody deserves a second chance. And I guess what I'm asking is can I have my snake back? Okay. I feel silly. I mean, I gave it to you a year ago or so, but, I don't know, I missed him. I think I missed him. I let Simon crawl down and form a belt. And I give Kynan just a gentle little clap on the cheek and say, I'm glad you're fitting in. I think you're well on your way to being that hero you dreamed of when you were younger. Happens to the best of us. You got all your toes? All right. (whispers) Do you think Grog and I could shoot a gun? Yeah? Grog, we're gonna shoot guns! Yeah! But I, like, I don't know. I throw things. Can you show me how it works? All right. (shouts) Gun, please! You're fast. I will let Percy load my gun. Plus dex modifier? 17. Vax, who was really giddy a minute ago, takes the rifle and hands it to you. These are dangerous. There shouldn't be too many of these. Fuck. You don't shoot with your gun, you shoot with your heart. I'm back in security guard mode. A minor thing. As we're walking back, I sidle up next to Percy and I don't say anything. I just do that friend thing where you just go-- and I keep walking. Other than when I was shooting the gun, I've been watching them like a hawk, as well. 29. There's a curse on you? Listen, buddy, you just learned the letter 'u' to say 'u-shaped', I think you should call that a win. Don't let these people tear you down, Grog. And also, I mean, if we take you at your word, and of course we do, so the curse, you-- you're very in tune with divine things and with curses and things of fiendish nature. You don't sense anything in yourself. It doesn't really add up. Is it possible-- I mean, they're family, and I know you love them to a degree-- but is it possible they're jerking you around? Am I remembering that incorrectly? You could also do that now. It's pronounced av-riggle. Also, do we really imagine whatever trouble they might be bringing to Pike's doorstep is something we can't handle? I mean, we've dealt with pretty terrible things. I have a hard time imagining it could be worse-- I'm not saying it's not dangerous, it should be-- Oh, I got a nosebleed. We could just do-- I mean, Keyleth could do her trick of turning us into ladybugs or flies or whatever and we could all hang out and follow along. I mean, mind-reading first. We can just be there, they don't care? Oh. I was shooting guns today. That's not bad. What time is it right now? We could also just take them out for a drink and get their guard down. I mean, you are dressed like a Faberge egg. Let's go with that. I don't think so. I mean, you're the holiest person in this city. Kynan's on it. The best I can do-- I mean, I can cast Divine Sense and Lay On Hands and-- I mean, I can-- poison and disease are things I can help with, but not-- Let's find out if you're a fiend or undead. And I do it. You're welcome. Is there some embarrassing thing hidden, tucked away, that you don't like to talk about? Like, are you afraid of pickles or you don't want to be-- Not in town on your level. I mean, and Vasselheim is chock full of clerics, so maybe we could find help there. Can Trinket and Doty ride in your-- I'm sitting on the carpet right now. Let's go glamping. Do you have any inkling of what would happen if you do nothing? Pike does nothing? I have the lavender. I have lavender with my armor. I have a pound of lavender with my armor. (laughter) It's not in my-- I keep it in a box with my armor so the armor won't smell like shit anymore, people. It's not-- is there a problem with a man having lavender in his possession? Yes, I do. It does now, man. I've had 12 months of downtime to figure my shit out. My armor is tight now. Take your guilt trips and bring them back to dad. I don't need them. That's good. That's a good one. Strength of seven. "In my-- nah. Right here in my-- nope." I'll go with. Vex and Percy. Right on the edge, looking down. I am, yeah. We left, we packed up. Some thoughts I just have inside my head. I think the twins will probably look around and make sure that nobody has been here recently other than us, or see if there's anything hinky. Eight. Come on, rogue. That is extra. I'm gonna play lookout and go out towards the edge past the arch, but sink in against the wall a bit and hide. Into the cracks of it, yeah. Common, Elven, and Abyssal. 21. If it makes you feel better, I rolled a one and used Luck. 21. Best you can tell. Before I decide, what is the thing doing to Pike? What am I looking at? Okay. I'm gonna click the Boots of Haste. I'm going to flip out the wings. And then I'm going to fly-- not through, because I don't wanna go by the thing, but around towards Keyleth and around towards Pike and grab Pike and fly her up next to Percival. I don't make those. 17. No. Yeah, that's the end. (whispers) Where does he get all these wonderful toys? Okay. I'm gonna shoot up and do a small little loop-de-loop and then slam down right next to Percival. Right up against it, so that I'm in a flanking position opposite Doty. And then dagger-dagger-dagger with a little bit of Smite. First one is a 33. Second one is a natural 20. Third one is a 30. Yup. Right. Okay, one-- and this is Smite on this. That one's a seven-- Can I put the Smite on any attack I want? I'll save it for the crit, then. Yeah, seven, 11, 17, 19-- 24, 27, 33, plus the psychic damage. 33 plus-- 41. 48 for the first hit. Second attack. Four plus one is five. Plus the psychic damage-- Is he a fiend? Is he getting anything extra from this? Okay. Five plus eight is 13, 14, 15, 14, so 28. 29 for the second hit. Then the Smite. I did. Oh, wait! I didn't-- Hold on. Hold on. four. Four plus-- There's no bonus. So it was four plus-- then I got an eight and a two, right? It was an eight and a two? Plus 12, 14-- Yeah, that gets me there. 28. Doubles to 28. And then one little--- Then one little, itty-bitty-- For four points. Feathers. Feathers. What's the plan? Rush it! Do the thing, Grog. Voyeur. Gently! I'm blasting off after her. Wait-wait! I already said I'm winged and Hasted, I'm already there! She can't go anywhere. 19. Yeah, I'll take her 100 feet up and give her a good view. I'm way up high and I say, I don't know what's going on, but it does not look good here. (laughter) Wait, in that second I can go 500 feet in six seconds, so can I blast down towards the cliff and dump her ten feet and keep going? Safely? Safely? Safely? I will go (whoosh) and let her take a little damage and hit the bottom. You know, I'm not gonna-- I can go like (plane sounds). I'll take a little turn up and let her-- she can take some damage. Or we could let the dude die, but I'm already doing it. I've got 400 more feet to go. Bullet train, baby. Saving throw? Okay. Okay. I have Luck. I've got one Luck left. 20. Sure. And the Haste is gone by the time I've gone through all that? Old bugger looks so sweet when he's sleeping. Windmill. And they were so tore up to hand over JB! It was like Les Mis. "What to do? What to say? Can you carry our treasure away?" You're a liar!
