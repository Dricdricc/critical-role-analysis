Sorry, they're gone. (laughter) Great costumes, lots of cosplay. Hey look, this is a book that she made, and it's so good! And she signed it for me and I'm reading it to my kids and they love it! 24. Take it. Okay. Clicking the Boots of Haste. I'm going to now-- I know that there's a clot of people, but I have a lot of movement now, so I'm going to slide back towards Grog? No, towards Tova. That's a big bear at the other entrance. Towards the other entrance. Oh, that's a wall. Then I'm going to slide along the wall up to where Grog is. Yeah. Am I within range of oily guy? What's the distance, though, ten feet? 25 feet. All right. Little test run. Let's dagger, dagger, dagger. Okay. Because I don't know if he's really there or not. First one is 33. Yeah, good. That's 12, plus eight, nine-- Well, I'm going first, so I've got the goods already. First blade goes, and I'm going to Smite him. No, I'm not. I went already. I have it because I'm going before. Because I'm smiting him, first hit's for 55 total. That's the first. The second is a 20 to hit. And the third is a 27 to hit. The next one, I will try-- So he has to save against a DC 15 for poison on the second attack. Yeah, I figured I'd try. The next is nine, plus psychic damage, damn it, 12. So a total of 14, just for those two attacks. And then I will use some more movement to move past Grog, still in the hole, pressed against the outside of the door, out of his sight. Moneybags, what the hell? It's hard to see the smaller ones. The bear musk over here is palpable. (laughter) (sings) You got the touch-- MARISHA and I'm totally into you, (stammering) Utugash. Gang sign, gang sign. Everybody buckle up. The rest of the party hears ermagerd, ermagerd, ermagerd! Yeah, that kind of hits. That does not hit. That also hits. I will use Uncanny Dodge for the tail. How high is the ceiling in that room? So there's a little space up top? Tary, you got some kind of Dispel Magic over there? All right, I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Vow of Enmity on the bone devil. Then I'm going to use one of my two actions, I'm using an action to Disengage from the bone devil and dance back past Doty. And then I'm going to chuck a goddamn Vestige at this motherfucker. At advantage. Oh, I rolled the same thing on both. 24 to hit. Okay, so, he's going to get it. Right, here we go. Two plus eight is ten, plus-- 38, and I will Smite him as well. 52. That's it, I'm done. Tova fire. Oh well, I'm good. I'm fine, I'm at advantage. Hopefully that's good. Not that good. No, hold on. This is dexterity. Oh man, it's not great. It's 16. I think I have one left? I think I have one left. So I'm going to use it. Oh, that's better. That is 25. Good to know. I don't think Vax has ever had one of Percival's bullets go right by his ear. It is unsettling. Did it go past me? Can I get an attack of opportunity? Nope. Nope. Hasted, with both daggers out? It's 23. More miniatures. All right, I'm going to shoot out my fucking wings and I'm going to Hunter's Mark the asshole, and then I'm going to skip-- Yeah. I'm going to skip Disengage and fly backward towards the end of the hall he came out of. It was wings, Hunter's Mark, chancing a hit as I fly down the hall away from him. Yeah, that's good. Nope. I'm going to chuck Whisper using a sharpshooter, but at advantage. 26. All right. 11, 21 plus psychic damage, sorry, doing math, be right with you. 58. Throwing the dagger? Yeah. Because I'm at advantage because of Vow of Enmity. No, it was on the bone devil. Also Hunter's Mark. So let's up that by one. I used everything. Wings, Hunter's Mark, and the dagger. Bonus, action, action. Fixed. Plus your strength of ten. So 18. Really cool words on the sheet. Waking up! All right, well, my enemy is gone. Percival just shot it through the face, so. I start to fly towards the entrance. The moment I come through and I see Keyleth mangled on the ground underneath, I just react and fly straight at the thing and snag onto his chest like an angry, pissed-off cat, and I just start slicing. I'm actually going to bonus action Hunter's Mark him as I land. I'm going to move the Hunter's Mark, excuse me, from the slain guy. Yep, and okay, and here we go. That is shit. No, well, it's 16. I'm sure it doesn't hit. Okay. That is 19. I'm going to stay hanging on. I think this is going to be a negative, but a quick clarification question. With them on the ground, then there's no flanking bonus, or anything-- That's what I thought. Checking. It's a zig-zag motion. I'm going for a ride. I'm on this guy's chest, by the way, and he goes down, and it's landing on the ground, I love what you do! (laughter) Oh. I land and Lay on Hands Okay. I'll give him ten. Ten. Slap! Are you all right? Are you really all right? Are you having fun? Stone-cold dead, you did. Congratulations. No, that's the Tempest, that's the Tempest, man. That's Kiki, that's Keyleth. Vax Dagons onto Keyleth's shoulder and watches all this through the window. This is weird. (laughter) That's a pretty big meatball. Weakly limps over. What about you? Where are you from? Since the little ones got away, do we want to turn this into a walk-and-talk? I fly in alongside. You know, all you have to do is ask. Will you hold still and give me ten seconds? And I'll check the rest of the room, just in case. Okay. I'm just going to check for traps. 30. There's spots on the ground? All right, just hold on-- stay over there. Do I see anything of value or anything else in the room, besides the traps? All right, we've got to am-scray. In which of these rooms did that trap door open? Okay. I'm going to walk towards Grog. I'm going to join him. Her game, man. We surrender, Grog. I surrender, and he's coming along. Did you say you want to go to the disco with me? He read you bedtime stories. 27. Yes. Door with a grin. Right, left, straight, straight, left, straight, right. And we're still strung up? I'm going to start doing something. Yes! Dead for a ducat, it's dead! (cheering) Can you Druidcraft into my hand? Can you give me a thorn, something long and thin? Do you really want to? Get my lockpicks. Okay, bring it over here, love. Already doing it while she's-- Am I at disadvantage or anything because I'm-- 27. Yeah, I start with my sister. 27 again. All right. I'll just hit the whole group, then. I hand her a spare. As I get Tary out. We're going to be fine, this is going to be fine. I can see you shaking. It's going to be all right. You're with us. Do you know what to do with a knife? Okay. You also stick the sharp end of it into things. And I take out the Flametongue, and I stick it in-- this is a loaner. I'll get it back from you when we're done here. Oh, you have that. I rest my chin on her shoulder. Is it a sticky one? All right. Rather than do it, I just grab a hold of her elbow and I shift her to the side and feel through her bones into the lock and-- Yeah. Yeah, man. 27. Oh, it broke! Could you "pick the lock," Grog? No! Can't we fly? Can't we be flying? But we could be hornets, or flies? There's flies all over this shit. We're not in the woods though. Flies. All right. "Where is Harvey Dent?" (high-pitched squealing) Fly with purpose, fly with purpose. Straight. We didn't take a left yet? I thought we were taking it. Yeah. Plus ten. 37. Solid, or bars? Yeah. Is there any hidden door here? Search for a hidden door. I'm searching for a door, as a bat. 18. I start battering into the door. Everybody's doing something different. Aren't you glad you're playing with us? Oh man, put us in a Strahd campaign. Drop some guano. Guano, guano, guano. Matt turned 12! Matt turned 12! We're dashing. Is it an attack roll or-- But if it's under my AC? Oh we're a bat-- bat's AC. Thanks. My armor is set to fire, so do I take one anyway? Okay. Terrible. Terrible. Big seven. Okay. Yeah. And I'm weak. Bat-bear! Were-bat-bear! Batman. Bear-man. Man-bear. No. Nope. Oh, it just hits me. Can I Uncanny Dodge? Okay. Yeah, eat it. No. That is what I want to be. You just do it. As a bat, do I have an action and bonus action like Vax does, or just one thing now? Well, I will disengage as a bat? Can I use my action to disengage? Yeah. We're in new territory. If they hit me, I'm back to being in regular form again, and there's three of them, so I'm going to disengage-- -- and then fly as far as I can towards the group. We might be able to outrun them. Thanks, Keyleth. I run and skip right up next to my sister and I have a potion of superior healing and I pour it into Keyleth's mouth. Yes, I know. 22 more. How long has it been since the pit fiend moment? All right. And I'm going to, as a bonus action, chuck Whisper into-- no, it has to be tied to an action, doesn't it? Oh, well there's nothing else I can do. I can get up with a bonus action, though? No, bonus action was the potion, no? Can't the potion be a bonus? Okay. Then I'm done. No, I'm out. Fiancee and campaign? Killed. Pop-pop-pop, motherfucker! LAURA and Percy's in hell, Hanson playing in his brain. Yes! You got any projectile shit? From the gods. I'm looking for fucking traps. Fanged smiles. Oh, 22. Eight for Vax. You. I'll take it. I'm at like two-thirds, I guess? No, that does not hit. Yes, I am. Happy to. I saw my sister get picked up and put down, so I know where invisi-bear is, and I'm going to push through and feel along my sister's shoulder and feel were-bear's arm and say You're in the middle of hell. This is a Ring of Invisibility. Thank you-- and push through, and I'm going to try to use my bonus to push all the way through and fill that gap. I have an action and bonus action. Can't I use the bonus action to dash? All right, well, I grab Keyleth's hand and we're going to work on closing this gap. My action wasn't to give her the ring? I'm out. Can he yank Vax? The ring's a loaner! You've got to live, Tova. You've got to live! You've got to Bilbo Baggins your way out of that shit! Maybe your ghost can haunt us. "Remember when you left me in hell?"
