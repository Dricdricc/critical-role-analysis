Let me see. I'm going to keep it aiming around. You're on now. I lost Laura, you got Marisha. Throw questions at her, and I'll ask them to her. Keep waving. Yay. Hi cast. Okay, good, good. Woo, woo. Kirsten says "Marisha, this is cray cray." Oh jeez I backed into-- How are you Marisha? Favorite beast form. What's your favorite beast form? Right. Sentimental value. Yeah yeah. How are you doing? You want him on camera? There he goes! Whoa! They look just like each other! How does that happen?! What's your favorite spell? I'm getting a "Woo-hoo Kentucky." MARISHA and MARISHA'S All right. Minxie, thank you. I'm going to find another cast member and bother them. All right we'll go back to Laura. Yeah. "Liam, can't see the face camera is pointed down?" I don't think so, I see Laura's face on it. Well if you come around you're going to see-- See? Someone say "I see Laura" if you see Laura. Hello from Alaska. Hi Laura. They see you. How does it feel making 50 episodes, Laura? Yeah? Elaborate on that. What's your-- I'm going to cheer you up. What's your favorite Trinket moment? Yes. Ever. You're welcome. You come back at the end! Mm-hmm. What are your feelings on Grog's recent death? (humming) Nope, not going to ask that one. Nope. All right, I'm going to find another person. They're busy. Right, stuff. We can't talk about that. You can answer questions right? Okay. Can you break your NDA and tell us what you're working on? No, they didn't ask that. What's your favorite book, Taliesin? Surely not, no. Question from me What's your favorite comic book? What are three of your favorite comic books? Mmm. Another question from me. How does it feel to find out I have more natural 20 rolls than you? Natural 20s. (laughing) I think you have more combat 20s. I also lie constantly. Just like constantly. Yes. (humming) (humming) In the entertainment industry? Probably in all industries. She said you don't count. She said-- You also-- when you roll 20s, you really celebrate. Noticeable. (laughing) I'm going to attempt to turn the camera around --camera. Oh look we're still there! So that's all right. I'll answer two questions. The right ones. Okay. (humming) The podcast will happen sometime in late 2022 after civilization has fallen. We will be using tin cans and a string. Oh man. I'm going to pull my pants down but right in there? It is the nastiest; it is dark brown. Terrible. Hmm. (noise) The game with my daughter has not happened yet, that's on Sunday. Where are Travis and Sam? They're making out in the men's room. Laura, if Trinket was a person, what would his race and class be? Were-bear? He's a Care Bear. Somebody asked who is the best archer. No, between you and me. They didn't ask about Ashley, they asked about you and me. You sure? That's not what I remember. Pride talking. I shot all the bows and hit the target all the time. All the time. I hit the target all the time! I told you I was a liar. Let me see, one more-- give me a twin question. One twin question. I'm sure Travis watched the NFL draft. Oh cool. (gibberish) Always, that's the answer, everybody. My middle name is-- My middle name is Christopher. Dawn? Dong? Laura Dong Bailey. How do you guys play twins so well? We actually crawled inside the womb of a large animal for a day just to experience that together. It was. I was glad to get back out. It was a whale. (mumbling) Uh, seriously twins in real life? Yes, Liam, will you be on Tabletop? (I don't know noise) Talk to Wheaton. (humming) That's not possible. "Do you ball like Jordan?" Hell yeah, I ball like Jordan. I'm terrible at sports. All right, I'm going to find somebody else. Scandalous. Okay. Remember to Turn Undead. All right. Here is-- oh look they're over here! Quick! Ask these a-holes a question then we'll go back and get on the video. Yes. Ask them questions. Manly questions. Tell Travis "Go Cowboys." "Are you excited about Zeke?" Somebody just asked. Favorite flannel? Oh no, somebody just said that was their favorite flannel. Sam, how are you so manly? All right guys, I think we're going to go get-- oh fuck a duck. We're going to find our way back to set so I'm going to end the Periscope. Thanks for your patience. Yep. Go Kevdak. What did I say?
