We should just get a sound cue for that at this point. (like an air horn) Dungeons & Dragons! Well, Travis, some might say that you were forward thinking. Ha! Ha! Oh my gosh! I'm so excited! I've had this idea in my head for two years! Two years! I wanted to do it last Christmas! I'm mostly ready. We'll see what happens. It's going to be fun! It's going to be so much fun! If you fail, it's half damage, not full damage. Hello! I hear you're trying to do a rogue action. Do you need to have any company below? Caleb starts speaking in Zemnian What are we doing? What are you talking about? This seems rude to me! What is going on? Zemnian. He was vague about his wording at that moment. That's pretty freaky, too. Which one of these two is taller? Who-- what-- how-- why are you on the boat? That clarifies that, okay. I am halfway through Identify on this clockwork gizmo. I was doing a ritual casting of Identify as soon as the thing was in my hands and not talking to anybody. What is this thing that you have? What is this called? Does it have a name? Yeah, did you make it? Did you get it from someone else? In a museum, or--? What's his name? Yeah. Sir Cadigan? That's a good name. Well, Twiggy, tell me. This happy fun ball of yours, what does it do? How much money? That's a Frumpkin and a half. Sometimes a spider and other things as well. This does other things besides making money? What else does this do? Okay. 21. That would explain the money, yeah? Can I tell how old this thing looks? Cheeto dust sprinkles out. No, I don't hear anything. Is it limitless? Does it make money all day long? Can you show me the one way? Excuse me, one moment. Twiggy? Would you show me how you make money with it? May I see that one more time? From perfect memory, I duplicate what she just did. Well, I take them. Yeah. I walk it over to him. Here you go. No, I don't think that's a good idea. What are we going to do with this little kid and/or old lady? Oh no, don't you dare. It's an 18. Yeah, I'm not a happy guy. (awkward, forced laughter) Do you have any prospects? Any long-term plans, goals? Where do you see yourself in a year, let alone a week from now? What about Kiri? What about Nott? That's going to draw attention to us. Is this regular paint or the magic paint? That's good! 21. Noted. I am also worried about traveling around-- Well, I am not a fan of the name Balleater for this boat. On a similar note, I feel like our new miniature friend will also draw attention. Maybe I'll have a chat with her, get us on the same page. Sometimes people listen to me. Well, it takes two to tango. My palms are sweating at the moment. I am going to find our little friend. How long has she been doing that for? Bitte, a moment of your time, just to have a chat. You can keep swinging, but could you swing a little lower? All of that movement is making me nervous. Welcome to The Mighty Nein. It's sort of a running gag, but it's our name. You know, if you're going to be traveling with us for a while, I have a few suggestions. So three. The first of them is probably when we get to land, it will be better if you kept a low profile because we sometimes cut a rough swathe wherever we go and I can't guarantee that someone is not familiar with us. So I would hate for any danger to, you know-- best not to call attention. Well, just stick with us for a little while, and see how that works out. Okay. The second suggestion is that you should meet my cat, Frumpkin. What's the matter? Oh, my cat is very well trained and will not hurt your squirrel. I promise. I scarcely know what to do with you. We'll get to the cat in a minute. I will so gladly introduce you to my cat because I'm very fond of him and love for people to meet him. But before we do that, the third suggestion is-- and I cast Suggestion-- I suggest you share any strange or unique or arcane objects or things even that are of threat with me just so I know that we are safe. That's rough. 16. Oh, how about you just sit next to me? Oh, put that back in your pocket. Always. I put one of my hands through their heads. Oh, that's good. Yeah, I'm not going to try to do that. Is there anything-- Yeah, the neatest. Do you have anything that is harmful or is it just those two things including your puzzle ball? Yeah, okay, well-- For what it's worth, I apologize, and here's my cat. I turn Frumpkin the first night on this boat into a cat and use the last of my supplies, so it's Frumpkin the cat right now. That's Frumpkin. He is best cat. Of course. He's already climbing up her shoulder. I tell him to do a blep. So he just does this-- All right, you're okay. You can hang out with Frumpkin for an hour. (laughter) I go and sit like 20 feet away and watch to make sure everything is on the up and up. Yeah. Well, if she's shown me everything of arcane nature. We're going to force perspective this shit. (as Gandalf) Hello, Twiggy. Maybe three. One is in Fjord's gooch. Oh, I'm very curious about it. I would like very much to see if she's willing to sell it or part with it somehow. I was not paying attention. Has anyone said how long it is until we reach land? TALIESIN and Maybe she'll lend it to me. This is still the same day, correct? Yeah, hello, your hour is up, I need my cat back now. Okay. Maybe another day, though, you can see him again. I'm sorry that I used arcane trickery on you. May I borrow the Happy Fun Ball for a few hours, just to play with it? If you want this to poop coins, I don't think you should do that too much. You've had it for a week? Oh boy, oh boy, okay. I wander off with it to study it. I rolled a 16. Sometimes it takes a while for my mind to settle on truths, and I'm having a hard time thinking about it right-- you know, maybe I will save this for later. Ja. Well, you just have to tinker with it a little bit. Holy cats. I pick up the jade. Are you looking to sell this, by any chance? So a good trade, you're talking about. What about-- I'm going to throw out some ideas here. I'm going to start spitballing, because I'm very curious about this. I love puzzles. What about some sort of mystical tattoo? Many things. I have been listening to my friend, Jester, speak of them a lot. All the time. That is true. This one time, she watched an ant carrying a piece of bread six or seven times larger than it up stairs. I've never, either, but I take her word for it because she's on the up and up. Maybe you talk to Jester about a mystical tattoo. That's one thing on the table. You could be an honorary member of The Mighty Nein. I do, too. (gasping) Thank you. Hey, you get the whole day. Danke schï¿½n. (singing) That was a fun time. Good. I'm short circuited from the kiss on the cheek. Yeah, no, I know, it's not helping! 22. No! Have you ever seen this before? We don't see through? No, that is a very bad idea, Twiggy. If you want to make that arrangement with your squirrel, you are perfectly welcome, but my cat is not going in that hole. (foomph) For the moment. Something-- Captain! And it's traveling with the boat? Is there any lumber? There's no oars. Are there any rifles left on this boat, or anything long? Yeah, rope, is there rope? Let me borrow that. I'm flustered. I start lowering rope down in, maybe five or six feet. And I pull it back out. I don't know that it's fine. There's a hole to nowhere in the middle of the boat that came out of Happy Fun Ball. What do you call this thing? LAURA and No, I am not going to put my hand in there. I mean, at the very least we need to put a plank of wood over this so that nobody falls into it. Fjord, First Mate Beauregard, I'm glad you're here. I want to introduce you to the new honorary member of The Mighty Nein. Yep. The bigger, the better. I will say, what we have learned on all our travels on the ocean is, the days are long and you have to make your own fun. It's getting more pokey? Less smooth and spherical? Does this thing, every day, sort of shrink back in on itself, or do you ever slide it back together? Or has it been getting more complex over time? Oh, okay. It took me a few minutes to-- Oh, okay. To press-- oh. (clicks) You could have been decapitated, doing that. Keen Mind, nah, it's a minute. Are you readied? What did you see? Could you see? Beauregard, let me see this. But it's on the coat, yeah? It's the coat, it is boots, and the third thing was-- It's a vault. Here, hold this. I give her the doohickus, and I say I need 30 minutes. I gather up all this stuff, and I walk with it, very happily. I also use an additional ten minutes to touch the coat and cast Comprehend Languages on this, see if it says anything. MATT and Well, we have just robbed Halas. Old magic. Natural one. Just roll with it, though. Okay, are you ready? Eins, zwei, drei, (click). Which I am memorizing. Yeah, sure. Somebody, come on, three rollers. Were you in this ball? What did he look like? Why don't you all take ten steps back, and we'll see what this next hinge does? Oh, investigation for it, yeah. Investigation, 21. I would give me the advantage, probably. Oh, shit! I'm at plus eight. Yeah, sure. Remember that sphere? I cast Mage Armor. There's no entrances or exits? 13. Yeah, I have it. Danke. The lightning came out of here? Did any of his friends get out? Hey man, you let strength be the dump stat. I have an idea. I can make a magical hut that nothing can pass through. I am going to begin to take the minute to cast Leomund's Tiny Hut in the center of the room. It's a ten-foot radius, and everyone is allowed to enter and exit. Absolutely. But I have to stay in the center of it where it is safe. You can stick your hand through the barrier and cast Mage Hand and pull back in, yeah. This is impervious to-- yeah. We'll get there. We can experiment because this is impervious. It cannot come in here. Oh, hours. That is a good point, although I have a decent supply of honeycomb. We could knead it up and make earplugs for ourselves. That's just as good or better. You are clever. Before and after, okay. We are still safe in here. Yeah, I think so. We have heard everything that happened outside of this bubble. If it is wailing at us, I don't know what that would entail for us. Yeah, that's correct. Nott, you could at least give it a whirl. Picking that lock. We are in here for another seven hours and 40 minutes. You've got to follow through. I am placing Frumpkin outside of the bubble. I am going to go look in the next room. 13. You know, I could throw some light out there, but I don't really want to announce our presence. What do you think we should do? He would have told me if he heard-- I can't hear you. I come out of it. I don't want to really announce our presence if there's somebody out there. I don't know. Caleb says nothing. I'm going to watch everyone safely go to the door and not get killed, and then drop the bubble. It would stay there, yeah. Oh yeah, if I leave, it's gone. Hightail it out of this fucking room! With your staff, yeah? Do I recognize it as an obvious arcane effect? Natural 20. Okay, I relay this to the group. We jumped dimensions to get here, and whatever is laying before is not a hallway. In a way it is, but not the traditional sense. It might be, yeah. You said we can see the end of this passageway, but not what's beyond it. 15. Like stepping off a moving sidewalk at the airport, but way worse. Ring based. Nosebleed. I think both of you should be taking a look around in this moment. The worst roll. Old, just like the device. The red bubble? This is some labyrinth shit, motherfucker. I know a lot of people are doing a lot of things, but eventually get to me, I'm going to start ransacking the desk for notes about that. I'm looking for a way to help Fjord right now. Six. Oh, she's in it! I am going to trust my friends to take care of the monster. I have a feeling about the desk. This is what I would do. I would think that there might be something in this man's desk, so I start looking for anything of use. It is a 16. Okay, so then what I do is think All these things can kill me. I back away from the desk. I'm going to move as far as I can away from the dresser, along this way. No, I'm sorry, I meant-- Exactly, so yeah. That's it. Fava beans. Deborah, can you be here every week? That cabinet had a mother! Fjord, Fjord. Yeah, what are we going to do about it, Nott? I'm going to join the women up top. Are there any sigils or writing anywhere on the frame of the window or in the window? Balls. Five. I want to climb down the ladder and look for anything, not books right now, but are there any buttons or switches or anything out of place, anything besides decor and a library? Perception or investigation? I'm looking for hidden switches, or-- 23. So burned book and-- Nott, Twiggy, would you both come here, please? This book-- Ja. Do you see anything that could hurt us by touching this? Do you make anything of this? Ja. 22. We have to get Fjord out of that window somehow. I'll touch that book. No. Yeah? I will make four globules of light, and I will try to put two of them on our side and two on the other side. I don't know if breaking it is-- 12 plus straight add the intelligence? 17. It's not here. One of you little ones, please, would you use your magical hand to touch-- there's a jar in that drawer and there is a bottle of ink. If they are safe to touch, but don't use your fingers. That smaller desk? Thousand-year-old roll top. They're all locked. All these books are locked. (stuttering) I walk to that shelf over there and are they free? Do the books come off the shelf even though they're locked? Try a single time. Okay. I put it in my bag. Just do the two next to that one and then we'll go. Yeah, they're very good. Just do one more. Okay. We're going to go follow them and we're either going to die or get out of here. I hope we get out of here. I need them. Let's go. I climb up and I'm screaming at Nott Let's go! Nott, this is torture to me! Let's go. After you. I take her finger and I push our fingers together on it. New campaign. It was a red herring. That was a trap. You got the jake legs. Only those present? You rolled a six. Plus his dex, so nine total. Plus that. Plus six for your touch attack, so 18. It would kill me. How high is the ceiling in here? Wait, that seems much higher than 20 feet. It's hovering above. Thanks. I'm with you now. Two minutes later. Nice! Give it to Fjord, he'll touch anything! Roll high. He could hold an attack. Halas, Halas, Halas! You don't want to goldfish it. Missile snare? How would you know? It was 50-something last time. What kind of damage? Wait, is there any armor on your head? 68% guys. It's cool. Meld into Stone. He's going to Blues Traveler it. Twiggy is the only visible person. Five little lit candles. It went through the head. Terrible. Five. Seven. Minor question. Do I smell burnt ozone, since you said that just a second ago? Good enough. Oh yes. Four. Fuck. I don't see Jester; she's not here. I don't see Twiggy. I heard her voice. Nott is up. There is a dragon. I'm going to cast Expeditious Retreat and since that is transmutation-- and I smell the ozone as soon as I hit the ground-- I am going to make my Transmuter's Stone make me resistant to lightning. I am going to beeline for the sphere. Fuck. Oh. Okay. Yeah, we self-corrected already. Mercy kill Jester! Double that sneak attack damage! No one's going to believe her! Fist fight. To burn the reaction, yeah. Twiggy, do you have that jar of beads? Are you attached to it? Thank you. I walk off. I walk off. Already gone. You stowing away, is that what's happening? Halas. Are you okay? (quietly) Would you jump up here? Would you jump up? Yeah. I'll look at those tomorrow. Let's go get some sleep. I start walking off towards our quarters. What a fucking delight Twiggy was! Descriptive. Thanks for playing.
