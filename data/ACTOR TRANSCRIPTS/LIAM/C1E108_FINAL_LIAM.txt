You look handsome in any hair. Wow, look at all that white and pink. Oh, the artist, Ioana Muresan, who is a long time Critter and has done a lot of art for our show, and we love her, and she did such a amazing job. Thank you. Look at this! It's got gilding on the sides. Everything shines. I'm not going to play. I'm just gonna look at these. They added Horshack back into the cast. That's a reference that nobody in the audience got. Yeah, I know how much older than you I am. I know that I had just poofed the wings out and I think I was inspecting one of the big metal men before it came out of the wall. I don't really remember which. They didn't Man-E-Faces around? I'm misremembering that? Maybe I just really like Man-E-Faces. Oh sorry, I was looking at a book. 18. Sorry. All right. To start, am I within striking range of him if I back up a little bit? Yeah. Do I need to disengage? Okay, so that I'm that close. Okay. I'm going to use my bonus action to Hunter's Mark him. And then I'm going to stick him in the face is what I'm going to do. So that's 30 for the first. And for the second. 30 for both. Yeah, because I'm at advantage because I'm going before them. All right. So the first one, which will get the sneak attack fun, is ten plus psychic damage is 16 plus sneak attack damage. (counting) 38 for the first. Plus Hunter's Mark. 44 for the first and for the second is one. That's it. Is one plus the Hunter's Mark again, right? So it's only for one attack? Because I don't use it all the time. Every time? So five for the second. Just five. Wait! That's not true, sorry. 11. Because it's not an offhand attack, it's my second paladin attack. I'm going to risk an attack while I'm not hasted. I'm going to risk an attack and back up about ten and go up another 15. 18 plus 12? Just barely hits. Escher man is down! I love being able to see everything. Percy's turned into Rambo. But he got pushed. What a fool. Yeah, hide yourself under the coals. This combat just got a lot sexier. All right, I want to slam down right-- Yes, all right, slam down right by that one's head, straight down to the ground, take a split-second to look up at the watery druid, shake my fucking head, stab, stab right into its face. Yeah. Okay, so the first one is a 33. Yeah, and the second one is 28. All right. So he's prone; he's at disadvantage. I'm going to dump Smite into both of these. Yeah! (counting) 36 plus the Smite, which is 32, 39 for the first, and then for the second hit is two, six, eight, plus the Smite, eight, ten, 12. Then, so with the way Hunter's Mark works is I can move it to another as a bonus action? Can I get it over to the one by Grog? Oh jeez. 90 feet. Okay, so I should have a little bit of movement left, so I'm going to shoot back up, high-five my girlfriend on the way, and go as high as I can in the room. I'm only 60 feet because I'm not hasted wings. Okay. Awesome. The tarot cards! But coffee and Wyrmwood are the two best things, so you're mixing the two best things. (yelling) I'm going to land down next to the other one and start looking in the same fashion. Across the room. 27. Oh, that's how you do it. I push on my sister's shoulder blades. (groaning) I barrel-roll out of the way. Hey Scanlan? You want to use your dragon fisting friend to put that pyramid in the coals and heat it up and then shove it back in? Do you want to use Bigby's Hand to take that pyramid, shove it in the coals, heat it up, and see if that makes a difference, shove it back in hot? Well, maybe the pyramid heated up could make a difference. Finish my stupid idea, and then we'll move onto the next stupid one. I fly over, I'm Deathwalker's Warded to fire and I'm going to start helping. Why don't you make their dreams come true and rip their groins off? That is a really good macaroni art you've made. It's so good. That's a boat, right? I am. I creep up past my sister and place a hand on his knee, which is in my fucking face. I can get in there. Sure. You want me to get a look? Thanks for watching everybody, that's the end of tonight's show. Oh my gosh. Can you add any of your secret sauce to my sneaking? Never mind, I'll be fine. Do I need to do an additional stealth? Creepy is automatic. It's a given. Okay. Natural 20. If he's here and I'm over here, can I fly up just there so I can see the front of him a bit? The angle of his face, if there is one, anything to see? Or is he facing out towards us? Never mind then. Shoot. Nice. Float in space and do that. No, from where I am. I'm not making noise, I'm not flying closer to him. I'm just doing this. Whatever you want to do. Okay. I'm going to fly back to the gang. Could you pick this fuzz off my face? I couldn't get it off the whole time, it just keeps re-affixing. I don't know. I flew in and out. So what do we think we're doing here? Are we talking to this thing? Can I get another quick re-rundown of the room? So he was up at the top of the stairs, facing out, not moving and was that wall behind him, or does it go further past him at all? And when I got in there, I didn't get close enough to see if there was any good hiding spots beyond him? 24. Do the talking thing, I'm going to go back in. And DM. How long were we in this room? It's been an hour? My wings then are-- Actually, I'll throw out that I crept back in ahead of that, so in there, hiding. I'm going to down a potion. And then a quick question, too. Hunter's Mark has a duration of an hour, but since that last battle lapsed, am I then not allowed to slide it to this guy? Come on, vacation Scanlan. That's all right. We did our due diligence. We poked it and we prodded it. It's the best shirt. This very shirt? This one? I know you, so I'll ask you later, too. He's going to hit you like he is at a driving range! 20. Jeez. Oh jeez. You know what, I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to run over right next to Keyleth. Right. I know what I want to do here. Is Percy within 30 feet of me? Okay. I'm going to cast Bless on Scanlan, Keyleth, and Percy. You're so capable. You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before this spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number. So you three. That's my action. I have a bonus action. This is an intimidating map, Matt. I am going to roll backward and sit underneath my sister and her judgemental ass. Yep. Fuck yourself! Wow! Nope. It's so exciting! Wow, that was fast! And this is a straight-up attack. Yeah, I believe that hits. Yes, it does. Wait. I'll use my last Luck of the day on him, and he has to reroll. Wait. Ooh! Do you have a big dick, too? That demigod does not exist in this universe. Oh, the golem is dead. Damn it. What? Where did the big guy go? There he is! Can't get the golem, but you can get the cricket. Making up for the last time. Fine, give it to me. I can uncanny dodge, yes. Just uncanny dodge, so maybe I can cancel out his doubling. Yeah. Uncanny dodge halves the attack, so it'll be right where it's supposed to be. Uncanny dodge. Not good. 14. Okay, I would like to cast Vow of Enmity on this dick, which will put me at regular, because I would get advantage versus the disadvantage of blindness, so now I'm at regular. Oh, wow. I've got it here. Okay. Instead, I'll use my bonus action to cast Hunter's Mark. Visual on that as well? Okay, got it, never mind. It's not his turn yet, wow. Okay, I'm going to use my bonus action to disengage. I can move five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. And I'm going to get the fuck out of here. Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, there. And that's it, I'm fucking blind and I ran because I can't see shit. Done. He's coming to finish me off. Look at this motherfucker! Hey, you're blessed, so add 1d4. Plus 1d4. Well, he's strung us along on several battles to get all of our juice out. Man. Boy, it sucks, doesn't it, buddy? Good, go to the 250 hit point guy. Good call. This is such a shit-show! Love it! Hey, that's my magic trick! Oh, he's dead! He's dead, Matt. Game over. Blessed! Hashtag blessed! Bigby's Hand! Where you at, big guy? Oh, I love you so much! Holy shit! Captain Planet AC is 29. Hashtag blessed, though! He's already at a negative because of Bigby. He's on death's door, guys. We got him. Your hair is so white. You're like Steve Martin without the ukulele. I'm just so turned on by you. If any of those miss, you're blessed. (whispering) Yes. Yes, Percival. You broken bastard. Bring it. I have no fear. Hits. Uncanny Dodge. Halve it. Okay, halved. That gets me to 18. I hate holding my turn, because I don't understand it. If I hold my turn, I can only attack when it gets back to me, right? Can I hold my turn to cast Vow of Enmity until I can see again? I'm going to hold my turn until I can fucking see to cast Vow of Enmity and attack. I'm going to do fuck all without it. Yes. That's what I'm doing. This guy can get anywhere. He has shown us that he can get anywhere on this map. There's no point going anywhere. No, I'm going to stay put. That's what I'm doing. I've already called it. Can anybody do an attack of opportunity? And then, can I get an attack of opportunity even though I'm holding? I have no idea. Okay, so I had him flanked with Grog, right, because he was right between the two of us? So down to regular attack. Good. That hits. That's 18 plus a lot. Plus 14. That is 11, plus psychic damage is 13, plus these fuckers. (counting) 35. Yeah, maybe because I cut a bit? Can I see now? So now I can do my held turn. Am I within ten feet? I'll move forward a bit. Okay, but he's near-- Well, wait. Is he within ten feet of Grog, would you say? His foot? Well, I'm going to save it, then. I understand that. I'm weighing multiple options, dear. No, I will cast Vow of Enmity. I'll cast it on my bonus action, then attack, attack. To attack, right, to attack. Which was to cast Vow of Enmity and not to attack, as well? Vow of Enmity. (scoffs) Yeah. And I've already used my uncanny dodge in this round, I think. Yeah, so mine is 44 for me. Blind. Wow. That's you, and you, and Scanlan. What's your save? What did you roll? Is Grog close enough for flanking for her? Yeah, that hits. This is within the same round, by the way. Low. Hits! Don't even bother; I'm unconscious. There's a lot of rules and a lot of math. It's a big book. Travis has a job, another job. Must be nice. Good, natural 20. Am I at zero hit points and stable, or one hit point and stable? Love it. But we're not at the top of the round, right? We're still mid-round, correct? Kick a gnome? Movement, dash, action to grab him. I have had a jackrabbit knee under the table for ten minutes. Point of clarification. We're at the top of the round, so I just went from one hit point to two hit points. Safe at two. No one can touch me. Yeah, right? It makes remote play not quite as removed. Let me do a little roleplay here. Oh, baby! Come on, Captain Planet! Kiki, it's yours. Wait. I don't need it. Wait. The massive gash across my entire body, as you stand there for 30 seconds, starts to close. That's gone as soon as he's done fighting. That's a half hour? Yeah, that was hard. Do I, with the fire on the Deathwalker's Ward? 25. Back at the temporary 137, due to the feast. Going with her to do the same. Investigation? Why don't you and I try? Shorthalt, you got any Bigby's left in you? He could do one. We could get him up there. Can you Bigby one and maybe Vex can slowly pull Grog up to that thing on your broom? This just turned into an Aerosmith video. Grog, if you do this I will give you something really cool. Really cool. Yours. Work that Play-Doh. Come on. I don't want to do that with everybody here. I'm not lying to you. It's really cool. Later. I promise. Edge? Yeah? 18 for me. I dropped my travel mug. Do we need to do this right now? Can we take nappies and come back? You would have a whole other batch of inspirations in the morning. It's a big iron pendulum swinging around.
