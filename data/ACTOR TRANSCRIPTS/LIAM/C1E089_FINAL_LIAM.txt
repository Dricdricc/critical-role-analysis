What does that mean? What does that mean? Oh no. Oh no. Notice he's got a towel down. My god. Happy new year! I feel like we just passed into performance art, there. Listen, real art makes you uncomfortable and challenges you. Hold on, Marisha. Are you okay? Are you okay? Put him in the game so you can kill him. You're like an Italian grandmother in Hoboken, New Jersey right now. It's physically beautiful but just the process we saw outlined is-- Beautiful, beautiful gift. I'm going to take a dump in that box, at your house, the first opportunity I get. (all laugh) Badass. 32. Oh, I thought you said 25. Oh, you want me to tell her? It just says your name on it. And it says, "Take these wings and fly." Oh, jesus. Where are we? I just loop my sister's head and then I loop Keyleth and I just pull them in. (gasps) Where are we? Welcome to my last four months. Pike. Can I feel you? I take hold of the Jello head and press my head into it and say, thank you, sister. Thank you. Whoa. Hey, I feel like shit. (spits) I walk over to Grog, and I try to reach my arms around him and fail. You fucking fucker, come here. Ah, you've met me, right? Yeah. Me too. Don't we all? I'm alive. Who is that? That guy, who is that guy? Oh, I've read your book! I know you. How did you do, Tary? I'm 98% relieved and 2% bummed that I-- Yeah. Raven Queen. Just kidding! (weird caw noise) How much time has passed since I got brought back up there? About an hour? A little over an hour? A little over an hour? Just out of curiosity, do my wings 'shloop' back in? They did. Like we do. We're with you. Don't sweat the details. Nah, it's fucking badass. Yeah. I mean, this is a-- I lay down on the sand and just close my eyes. Keyleth, you have just passed the final challenge of your Aramente. Grog will take it back. I'm imagining a really simple etch-a-sketch drawing. Somewhere in the middle of all that serious talk, I've pulled my sister off to the side and-- -- have cajoled her into playing Airship. You know, when, so-- we used to do this as kids-- -- I lay on my back-- -- and I lift her up in the air-- -- with my feet holding her up-- -- and I'm kind of in pain but I can kinda do it. (groans) I am ropy as fuck. We are almost even now-- Well, we're twins, so, you've died, I've died. (all laugh) No, no, no. But you've died twice. So-- You are more ambitious than I am. (laughs) Yeah. You know, we really need a break. I think we're going to hell soon, literally-- But maybe after that, maybe we could take a break. I don't remember anything. (painful groaning) Hey, man, no judgment, it means you're just like me. What the fuck else are you gonna do? Did you give a timeline? No, you know, in all seriousness, I have been waiting for something. I don't know what. But I'm not running towards it. I think we'll get there. (sighs) I start to cry a little bit. I don't say anything. I think you just hit Whitestone. (all laugh) Does it sink through-- slowly through the Jello? I'm in the Deathwalker's Ward. (all laugh) Peachy-peachy. Eyes Wide Shut? Eyes Wide Shut. (all laugh) Everybody looks like the Raven Queen. (all laugh) She's fine. That is really hot. What was that? She's gesturing and I'm already climbing on. Don't let the jello fall apart. That! Guys, we've been playing this campaign for a while. (all laugh) Holy shit. Forget about strawberry, how about raw-berry! (all laugh) (deep voice) Whee! After she left our room to go find him, I start to suit up, and I'm looking in a full-length mirror at the new fucking kraken beak gouges down the front of me. And I notice that my two notes are out of place. So I'm going to shove them back into the folds that they're supposed to be in. And spend a couple minutes to button all the way up and leave the room. You're not Scanlan. With your mind! Except it's full of sulfurous shit. 22. That was Tary's fucking automaton. I slowly pull the sheet up-- Moves an adjacent piece of paper next to it and keeps going. Please, go through every picture, please! Old habits die hard. Oh my god. You know what? The Klossowski, Klossowski-- That was bullshit. That was bullshit. What's Percy's rapper name? Narrate it, Matt. That is not a picture of a goliath and a halfling, by the way. Made it smaller. Love Mama Pike. This is Dungeons & Dragons, man! This is Dungeons & Dragons! I have a fresh new set of six-pack abs after the last ten minutes. It's like an IMAX theater. Well, Hotis is going to come for Pickle and I at some point, but we need to do a little more homework this time. Gotta go to the liberry. It's a starting point. Orcas, orcas, after all of that under-sea-- -- struggle we need to be up to par. Jello shot, where you going? Twin on each arm pulling. Percy, get over here and pull! I'm sorry, old man, who's in charge here these days? The city? Who's running things? They're doing all right? Okay, everything steady as she goes? Sure thing, Grandfather. Stress relief. Yeah, you wanna see where we live? Holy shit! We're all a bit of a work in progress, it's fine, dear. Erwen. We thought natural causes might, you know. He has consumption. (Grog voice) And I crush him into jam. This is our keep, man. Fool. We've been vacationing from it for a while. I don't know how long we're staying here, but you can have my old room. You got a room. You can make shit, though, what can you make? Hats? Do you have a specialty? Do you do clothing, or-- What about a beard trimmer? Yes. He's looking a little shaggy. Yeah, I don't grow thick. It's pretty sparse, actually. Dirty birds. Wait! Where're you going? I want to go to the library. Yeah, beard trimmer. I need a beard trimmer. Hell. Orcus? Which one are we doing? Investigation? 23. Damn it! Vasselheim. Isn't there a library there? Is it blown to shit? Hey, that's a good idea you just had. In Westruun. Well shit, all right. Well, I don't think we should go charging into the Nine Hells like we did the ocean. Yeah, let's try to prepare better. Yeah. Maybe not today. We just got here. But yeah. We read Abyssal, we studied it in school. Oh, do you need help reading a book, Percival? Excuse, me but this is a once-in-a-lifetime moment for me. Do you-- immensely. Thank you, Freddie. Have a seat, let me translate for you. And a very merry Unbirthday to you. In Abyssal, the verb goes at the end of the sentence, which is different than in Common. You might not have known that. That's some bullshit. Did Shaun say to read it or to open it, do we remember? Okay. Do I see any kind of trap to the lock? No, I'm just checking, I'm not opening it. That's fine. Perception you said? 22. Okay. I will-- do we want to crack this shit open now? Yeah, I'm not gonna fucking read it, I'm just gonna open it for Pike. I didn't. Seems all right. Or on the book. I'm gonna try to unlock it. Well no, is there anything you want to do, Pike, before I open it? All right, so, hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. I'm gonna unlock it. I'm not even gonna open it. I'm just gonna unlock it. So I get between everybody and the book. Okay. That is a-- That's fine. That's a 26. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Keyleth, Pike, Vex, c'mere. I cast Bless on Pickle, on Keyleth, and my twin's far away, so I guess on myself. And then I step behind the girls-- -- and watch. All right, then. Trying to earn points with us, or what? Do a jump scare. Shush. Ooh. Is it Abyssal? I'll do it. That's very subjective! I already did that. I Blessed myself. Ooh! Well done. Well done. Bless, bless, bless. It's already good. Roll a d4 and add it. What does that Owl's Wisdom do? What does Owl's Wisdom do? You were reading for like 25 minutes. Yeah. She said. We could throw it in the black spinny thing under Whitestone, or-- -- we could just give it to Allura. Big responsibility. Do you concur? I concur. Well, we can, well, not me, but smart people can devote more attention now that there's not five great dragons trying to tear the world apart. Yeah. Back to the keep. We stay in the keep. Please. Please. I really want brunch right now. Stupid innate ability. Do we have an EMT and a stomach pump on hand for Sam? For after the show?
