It's kind of there (groans). Did I lose the big or the small? Clears that athlete's foot, though. Gone. Percy, I think you and I are on Tiberius duty. 15. I have a question. If I have advantage for other reasons-- I have a cloak of elvenkind which gives me advantage-- does the advantage and disadvantage cancel out into one? Right. 25. And what's the terrain? Is it just flat out out in the open to see, or is it scoured with ins and outs? Peaks and valleys? It's fine. It's an illusion. Vax pokes his head through the illusionary lava and goes, We're in here. Here's another option. My foot hurts, but I'm not too bad. How are you? We could go look. We need to undo the stone that has taken over Tiberius and Kima. Where did your kin take our big friend? Easy! Easy! You honestly would not be here if it weren't for the illithid. It's true. She disappeared with our goliath friend. Yes, you did. But that was just 30 minutes ago. I think we should all rest for a moment. I think Vex'ahlia and I should go out for an hour or two, just to see which direction-- I mean, they are not going to back to Emon. I was pretty awesome 30 minutes ago. Now I'm just slightly less awesome. Like Axe for Men? More like a Shadowcat kind of thing? Well that does sound useful. But concretely, right now we need nappies. But we are essentially powerless. I think it is safe to assume she's brought Grog back to her seat of power. Why would she go anywhere else? She's at her strongest where she is. Sleep. One last thing before we lay our heads down for the night. Pike, do you have any salve or anything you could help me put on my foot, or could your god help with my little toe? It stings a bit. I mean a clockwork foot from Percy does sound cool. Literally. That's Ben-gay. All that improv school paid off. (all laugh) Can I apply my Luck feat to her? I think I see Pike's deity in my toenail! (all laugh) And put a knife on it? I would take a brass claw. Lady Kima, Clarota, may I suggest you take the first watch? Rated M, for mature. We're busted up. She's suffering from PTSD. Why are you poking the badger? Scanlan, I'm very cold. (all laugh) That's a good idea. Come here, Trinky. Trink! Who wants nibbles? This is suddenly turning into Labyrinth. "Beyond the Goblin city..." Trinket's doing that thing where he pulls with his front feet and drags with his behind. This will greatly enhance your ability to move forward with us, won't it? Maybe on the way out. Plus ten? 33. Oh, Trinket rolled a one. Foot flakes anyone? Foot flakes? With the stalagmite coming up? Yes. Meaning it's all solid stone that color or loose gravel and rock? Vex'ahlia, you know the Underdark. Are there any critters crawling around in that pit? Can we see any sort of civilized construction here? Or is this all the work of nature or some living thing? 18. Like goliath? That still might be useful, even if it doesn't find Grog. Could you describe the dimensions of this one more time? So, from our left to our right, 150 feet? And is it a big circular shape? I say we take a wall. We're seeing the remains of buildings scattered throughout, maybe we could go from-- Well, there's little islands of structure left, we could just-- Stand bridge, stand bridge, stand bridge. Vax starts feeling along one side of the wall. Does the ground look firm and more stable on the edges? Or is it all just the same? Hand on the wall. No, but I mean-- yes. I'm not stepping out yet. I'm looking at the ground. Is it pebbles and rock all the way to the sides? Is it 200? Trinket weighs a ton. All of us together. Haven't you seen his wang flopping around under his tail? Well, I'm not going to leave her. Sneak right in there. How far is the closest little island of remaining structure that you referenced? The gods reward deeds, not words. Want to run those numbers again for the calculator? Keyleth, take the gnomes! Take the gnomes! Daggers out. I grab him by the cloak. What is it? What is it? Keyleth's the only one who sees it, though, at this moment? Yes, the twins pull him up and one-- LIAM AND And we saw the duergar get pulled under by skeletal arms? Yeah, the bones pulled down, right? So it's not just this thing. 17. I don't need this foot. Okay. No. There's undead things in there Tibber-hoods. 17. All right, well, I use my bonus action to click my Boots of Haste together. Boot of Haste? But aren't magic items resistant to-- Okay, yeah. Start sneak attack from behind. 32 for the first attack. So no one's right next to it? I'm the closest one? You block me every chance you get with this one. So that was the first attack... So first attack is nine. There's more coming. Here comes the poison dagger, which is 23. That is ten. Because of the Boots of Haste, I get a third attack. And that misses entirely. In fact, I think I threw my dagger into the bones. A one, yeah. It's 15. You're in the wrong group to being saying that shit, man. (all laugh) Right. You're a bullet falling from the sky. You're gnomic lawn art. You're further than five feet away, because had you been five feet away I could have sneak attacked. Spirit her on with anger. Good job. Attacking before it goes. 27. 11. That's Telekinesis, Kyle! (all laugh) I'm still hasted, so I'm going to use a bonus action to go stealth. What? Oh, it's blinded? But do I still need that to sneak attack, though? Or does it matter? Never mind. I'm running at it, and since Kima's right there, I'm going to stab the bejesus out of it. I'm going to use Luck on that roll. Okay, great. So that is a 29. Okay. (incoherent mumbling) So 19 goes to 38, and then the damage gets added to that, right? With the sneak attack, and the damage gets doubled-- The bonus at the end. Okay, all right. So what that is is 47. Okay, and then with that knife in, I'm going to stick the other knife in and attempt to attack it and then drag it to the ground. Grapple it to the ground with my body as I attack. Second attack is a 25. Okay. That's seven. I'll grapple. Okay. 20. Natural 20. (all cheer) With haste, I have a third attack. I'm going to drag across its throat. That is a 25. And that's seven. It's mostly in our favor. I giggle-snort. You can add that to your roll. So add inspiration. It's advantage, so pick the higher. Oh oh oh. It's got that healing factor. Ain't he grappled? I'm holding it. Good luck. Do I get advantage on this? Okay, good. 27. Here comes the one. If it hits. It could miss. You could do a regular arrow. Three successes or three fails. That's first fail. Okay, so Clarota's right by it, so I'm going to roll along the back of the thing and sneak attack right into its back. Right there. Yeah, roll around next to him, one dagger in. That is a 29. (counts quietly) Okay, that is 33, plus sneak attack damage, so three, seven. Shit. 18, 20. That's 40 plus four. 44. 51. I want to carve his shoulder blade out and away like a piece of turkey-- No. Critical's the double. Oh, sorry, scale that back to-- 20. It was 20 plus two, 22. 29. Next dagger's out. That was a bad roll, but I'm going to use one of my Lucks to do that again. That hits. That's 27. So that is seven points of damage. Last dagger out. That's 26, for eight points of damage. This is really awkward for the rest of us, just so you know. We really like her. I love it! (all laugh) It's scared of her. They're cursed. Air guitar us out of here? And you said it's flickering, the light? Probably a campfire. I'll go take a look. 25. Everyone rest while I go peek, because I'm fine. Disadvantage? But the cloak then cancels it out. So 25. Does it smell good? Into my earring, (whispers) Come, now. We found him. Double-edged. I do not. Is it a pony suit, is it Spider Gwen? What's she wearing?
