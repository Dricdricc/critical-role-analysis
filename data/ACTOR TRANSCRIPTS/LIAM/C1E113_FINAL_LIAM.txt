You are not allowed to go. You'll eat your rice and play Dungeons and Dragons. You know the meme, when the dungeon master smiles, it's too late. By the time he's smiling, you're already getting choked out. It's the second highest rated comic book on Comixology at the moment. On Comixology. We saw it. --me, daddy. What an accident that was. Oh no! That was a thing. Does anyone have my clothing? That's going to make tomorrow a little squirrely. Do you have all my shoes and glasses so I may have them? Okay, could you lead me and my penis towards them now? We're still standing here. It's getting awkward. Acrobatic. Should we maybe talk out our plan for the moment? No it doesn't, but I do think we should probably have at it. We've got the trammels, Grog's got them. What are your three attuned right now? Yes it is, we need to spread those out. We need to decide who is doing what, at least what we think is going to happen. I think I should take one of the trammels. One of these two. I am. What about you Scanlan? I was about 50 or 60 feet in the air and I was above him. If you do, and he slaughters everybody, and subjugates the entire world-- As the Crumbly, the little guy to Jabba the Hutt, for Vecna. I was above him though, and I was 50 or 60 up, he wasn't that high. Do you have anything gnarlier than-- I mean, I'm a little invested too, I've spent a lot of years with this bear-- like, anything gnarlier than-- an eagle's cool, but like anything with spikes, or rhino armor, or anything like that? Can you do a flying rhino? Does that mean you could permanently do it to him, and then we cast Dispel Magic on him later to undo it? Tonight. To lock him in. But if it's permanent, why not do it tonight? Could he be a baby, like a young ancient dragon? So did that live up to your expectations, then? New hobby, or--? I mean, that is flat-out amazing. Nah, we need two hats or something. Can the Meat Man join us? Can Vecna just dispel the second Scanlan away? You can never have enough Scanlan. There's always room for Scanlan. You know how Vecna rolls. Sing off. This is the last check off your list, I think. These last three or four years have been the best of my life. We need his head in the game. Yeah, Percy, get your rest, because your last words to me tomorrow need to be indignant and irritated. Goodnight, brother. (singing) Oh, my darling, I hunger for your touch-- Natural 20. So take a conk on the head! Welcome to the table! Yeah, he's attacking a gloomstalker; I'll join in. I'm going to help this guy out and throw. All right. Plus one to-- I did, and they both hit. All right, I will. Four-- It could be bad. 12-- 34, 35-- I can't! It's too late; it's triggered! 46 for the first. Joe, you're sitting on Scanlan Two. Eight. You were jumping at him, and punching him in the face. I thought wrong. I do that sometimes. 20, 21, and a miss. Is his proximity close enough that either of these guys are within five feet, or anybody's within--? I mean, I'm just going to do an insight check on principle. Yeah, I rolled an eight. He checks out. That's a ten-minute one, yeah? Two ones. It was slim fast. Slim feast. MATT and Do you mean actually; have you died? That's short term. I rolled a four, so it's 37. (deep voice) If I'm good at reproductions. A fighting chance. Well, we can try the door, and then if that doesn't work, Grog can make a new one. Let me check out the door. I'm going to check and see if the door is trapped. 26. 26 for investigation on the door. All right. Let's open it up. 28. I pick up a rock about that big, walk ten feet back, and throw it at the energy. Ooh, that's not good. 16. Yeah, I rolled a three. I literally just got choked to death 18 hours ago, so I'm not sweating it. What're we going to do? Destroy. I'm going to walk up behind him-- And plus two from me. Doesn't stack? Then I'm backing the fuck up. Feet skidding, like a Jackie Chan film. We can hide, though. We can't run. Ring. 46. No it's his mount. There's no windows on this side. And then would you say we could use the attic windows? It's up to you. Yes I am. Hateful eight. I got an eight. I'm way at the bottom. Could you ring up Tiamat and have her help with this dragon thing? 26. Evasion means zero. Grog does not count in melee of the dracolich, right? It's just toys. Sorry audio team. Unload. By Delilah or here? I really am? Oh my. Okay. Yeah, okay, so if I get to the very edge there, am I in range of Delilah on the ground with Sharpshooter? Cover doesn't do much, except full cover. And am I within 60 feet over there, about? Okay, I'm going to throw Whisper at her, and she's down, so I have advantage. That is a 27 to hit. And I'm going to bamf there. What, because she's prone? Her being prone doesn't give me advantage? That's much worse. 18. All right, second attack is a natural 20. Yeah. With Whisper, she has to make a saving throw with a DC of 18 or become frightened of me for a minute, on a crit. 18. All right. (counting) 72. Yeah, it's a crit. Double the dice. Oh, sorry, so. 32. Thank you. And I'm going to bamf there on it. Don't worry. And with my bonus action, I'm going to throw my third dagger up at the wall. Can I throw Whisper again? Is it like quick draw, or does it have to change daggers? All right, then instead I'm going to disengage, and I'm going to dart back between the Scanlans. Wait, she used a reaction to knock the dagger away. She used Shield, which is a reaction, so she can't hit me with an attack of opportunity. Never mind. Butcher that motherfucker! Modifier goes on at the end. Do you get them at Reproductions, too? I don't know about that. How are you doing there, M? Our reactions come from melee range. You said 120 feet away? All right, I'm going to use my movement and dash, so five, ten, 15... 50, 55, 60, and I'm going to paladin attack the gloomstalker up there. First one is great, that is a 33. And the second one is also pretty good, 25. Do those both hit? Okay, shit. Should've called Sharpshooter. All right, so the first one is one, plus eight is nine-- Seven, so 11 and seven. Just 11 and seven on that Gloomstalker. Yeah, but we can't get out of range of the ring unless we want to-- He'd still be in range-- Doesn't affect range, it just affects your chances. Sharpshooter doesn't double the distance? So it's at disadvantage normally? I got 26 for Vax. He didn't get a chance to go. But we're directly in front of the door a ways back? How far back? Well, our options are somehow flying up or going in the front door. I used to do this with string and a G.I. Joe for my cat when I was a kid. She loved it. I'm sure the rot behemoth will too. Wait, one second. Do we want to lure it into a house and all of us be waiting to gank the shit out of it? We just watched the wyverns get obliterated trying to fly into the swirl at the top. I mean, I love it, but I hate it. Oh, it was a one, but it's a 37 now. No, Matt told me that, because of reliable talent, one means shit. 30 rolls. This'll still work. Spread, and let him run right into the range of it? As soon as he enters he's in range, isn't he? No. No. Pickle, can you release a Sarenrae bomb? Vecna's going to be too powerful for a destroy or turn undead. It's for weak-ass shit like this. Wisdom for clerics. Eight, plus five, plus your proficiency bonus. 14, 20. Challenge rating of four or lower. Don't worry, Matt. Your luck is coming upstairs. You are now Michonne, from Walking Dead. You got two zombies. All right, well, up we go, then, yeah? I'm going to look for traps, as we go. Two miles away, ish. 18. One minute. Are we short resting or we doing little healies? I'm telling you, though, it's this or nothing. If we fall here, if we fail, then it's fucked, so even if it destroys half the city, it's better to have all of us at full fighting potential. No, but we have hit dice. You don't need the spells. I'm going to put up because I think that these two need it. Just roll a natural 20, Joe. Roughly how much time has passed since we went from--? Right right, but probably his box of dirt is not-- I'm going to, when we're right on the verge, when we think we're right on the verge, I'm blessing you and you. Is it one of these guys where we can see the height of the tower, or--? There's a death knight. Oh, excuse me. Where is Vecna right now? How high up? Right above us, way up, or a floor up? Way up. Okay. If I have the Death Ward, I will pop back up. What about Scanlan Two? Can Scanlan Two do it? I use Divine Sense and feel for undead. 60 feet. Fan out. 24 for me. Where's the exit to this room? We can go around the edge. What's making that so tight? Is there one trap that's making it so tight, or all of them? Did they seem arcane in nature? Do I have a shot in hell? Of disarming them? Natural 20. Okay, okay. (Marlon Brando voice) I could've been somebody, Arkhan. Instead of a zombie. Because I am. Oh, who's near me? Could I retcon and say that I'm-- What did you get? You got a natural one? If I'm next to him, because I give plus two to saves, does that futz with it? Do we want to try to get everyone else across before you do that? Maybe it's a one-time-only? Oh, okay. Well, I meant the necklace, but. Definitely take your armor off for this, though. Definitely. Paint me like one of your chromatic girls. Is it hot in here? Point of order. I know roughly how far Vecna is, right? So I should be able to tell, as we're getting closer, roughly how much distance? Halfway up the tower, three quarters, et cetera? Oh, that's dark. How long did it take us to get to this point? Who knows what is above us. It could be slower for the upper half. I cast Divine Sense. Undead. Traps? 18. How far above us is Vecna? I'm putting the wings out now. Also, I'm going to say this now, in advance. It might not be possible, but if we get to a door, I'm thinking ahead of time, if we think we're about to step out, I want to cast Bless on the three half-elves right before going out. That might not be possible, but it's in my head to do it. You're blessed. If it happens, hashtag blessed, a d4 rolled for every attack or saving throw. Up so that we're seeing the edge of steps at the top? All right, I'm stealthing. Are we Pass Without a Trace right now? 44. They don't look like the big kahuna, they look like the underlings? From my hidden position, I want to see if I see any traps in the room. I'm not entering. I want to do it from my peeky spot. Yeah. 23 for investigation. So what I'm going to do is slowly back down to the party, relate what I just saw. Three of them. What do we do? They're dudes in armor. They're lackeys. Is it difficult to use that silenced weapon of yours? It's a small room. You and I can probably handle two, but that leaves a third. Yeah. Could Stubby and I each target one and you yank one into the ground simultaneously? Can you do that right now? We don't want to create a stir. We might, so it's better that we do two quietly and leave one left. Can you throw your fucking Manners ball at the third? Yeah, so who's going in? Tell me again, the three that are in this room? Arkhan, we're going to handle the small. Right after, you'll handle the tall. I stealthed. You have to stealth, right? I will go a split second before my sister. Throwing on the right, throwing on the left. They all hit. That's good. Four. I'm doing okay, too. 80 for the first. 12 for my second. No, they all hit. All my attacks hit. 12 damage for the second. Do you remember anything, Shaun? I'm taking him by the cheeks. You're in a very bad place. You're in a very bad place and time. You need to get out of here. You need to take these women and go downstairs and hide. You are in no shape to do anything right now. You need to take these two women and hide downstairs. Do you hear me? There's no time to explain. No. His head is not where it needs to be. In 30 minutes, we could all be dead. But if we have any chance-- You three need to not be here. You need to go down now. Bless. Shaun! It was an honor knowing you. This is a great game! Joe Manganiello! (cheering) That was fucked up. Next campaign, we don't attack anybody! We talk to everybody! Every NPC, every hot dog vender, every lich! Talk! Fucked up! You managed in the space of a week to make the choke-out seem like child's play!
