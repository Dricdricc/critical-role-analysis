Hi, Hi. I am Tyriok. I make maps. Oh, well. I was turned to stone recently and I don't have two arms anymore. I have one. I can still roll dice though and I have maps and I have a compass and I am the least dangerous person at the tables. I'm not level one in anything, really, except maps. I'm level 15 in maps. I'm just happy to be here and be alive. Mostly. Do you know, people who are in love high five? Currently dead, but you weren't undead. My arm is dead. Cheers. So that's it. That's the show. Sorry. Sure, I've got it. We got 30 minutes, right? No, no, no, you can't take that back! Got it! It's off! I'm going to wear this for my kids all the time. Beginner's luck. I'm in there too! I've returned from the first game as Barker and I will yell at you if you're in my faction. Damn, that's got some weight to it, son! Mmm! (explosion noise) (as Tyriok) I shot something else off! Who is this Batman character? Applause, applause, applause! I mean, he doesn't have to take it off! Delivered in tiger? That's "later." Matt, I don't know how we're going to do this. I got to look right at you. I'm going to look at the torch over his right shoulder. (laughter) We got to go shopping or drinking or something, nothing serious for the love of Sarenrae. You look like Doc Brown exploded, I don't know what to do. 30 more minutes, 30 more minutes and we'll settle down. I would like to set the Deathwalker's Ward to Matthew's costume. That's from Vasselheim. I mean it's really reconfirming his whole life-view so, you know. Hi! Where? All right. I pull her further away. She won't expect it, but she is a fucking ancient being. Keyleth, I want to kill a dragon as much as you do. I know, but we want it to work. We want her to die. And if you and I do it, it's not going to happen. Her being sick is still up here. We need the others. I really want to use both my arms to take her, but I can't. I take her by the arms. And we need the others. If I thought we could do it-- Listen to me. I love you, and if you ask me again, I will go with you. But I don't think it will work. I think you and I will die. I think Raishan will spit on our bodies. You will not get what you want. And then Thordak won't die. No one will be happy. I understand-- I want this to be over. We need to stay with the others; there's-- Listen to me; if you tell me to go in, I will go in. But there's strength with the others. After this, if you tell me to go in, you say the word. It's not like I haven't tried to throw my life away already. You think I wouldn't do it for you? Hey. It'll happen. Pulls her in and touch foreheads. I don't think we're going to be waiting for long; I really don't. Yeah. Yeah. Ugh! It's a tiger! Tanner. Hey, while they're talking about all this, can I stealth away? I'll use Luck. 28. 28. I would like to go as quickly as I can towards Gilmore's house. (knocks) That's him, that's magic! (knocks) I'm so scared of this with that hair on your head. Why did I do this? Tonight? Hey, this is not fair. Can I come in to talk? Quickly, I have to head back to the others. No. I don't even have time, I just want to talk to you. All right. You know, we're getting closer to the end game here. We just killed another one of the dragons. Yeah. It is three. I think I might be dead in a couple of days. So I came here to apologize. If you think I have no feelings for you, you're kidding yourself. I care for you very deeply. I have for a long time. And I don't think I've treated you fairly. But I wasn't playing games. Shaun. It's been a little weird lately, and I understand why, but I want you to know that I love you as a dear, dear friend, and I really don't think I'm going to be here in a few days. And I would hate to think that I would be-- That guy'll be fast. Sure. Whoever gets you will be a very lucky man. Love you. I'm really nauseous right now. I almost didn't come here. Yeah. Yes. Goodbye. I leave. 'Till next time. I'm sorry I made you do that in that skullcap, Matt. All I saw was a very handsome man. (laughter) Been doing this since the 80s and 90s, man. You thought I'd be the one to fuck up. (laughter) Ten platinum? Sure. Ten or ten thousand? I'm not done with my errands. Can I go find Kynan? Hey, buddy. You look a little rough. You all right? Which one? You look really tense. You look out of character. Oh dear. Head back. We're going to have that meeting soon. Get your game face on, yeah? All right. I'm good. Best I've been in a while. Can I make an insight check? Seems full of shit to me. I'm going to use luck. I've got it. Who cares? This is a game. I'm with my friends. I'm having fun. That is an 18. But does he seem confident and happy is what I wanted to know. All right. (sighs) I'm happy. I'm in love. Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you later, all right? Oh, he is so hung. Unbelievably hung. I'll tell you later. I have to run an errand. We have to get to this fucking meeting, yeah? I'm talking about your goddamn antlers. Jeepers. Off I go. (yells) No! Jarett! Hey, I don't want to interrupt. Kynan, the new guy. Is he around? Okay if I go in? Just be a minute. Right towards him. Hey. How are you fitting in? You hanging back? He's a good man. Yeah, I get it. We killed another dragon. Yeah. I don't want you to question your decision here, all right? There's no question. But if you could, I have two favors I want to ask. First one is, after I leave here today, could you embrace these people? Yeah, I know, and I know you have reservations, and I know that you've got guilt. When I walk out of here, I want you to work on letting go of that. For real! Leap of faith kind of shit. Just let go of it. I know. Scratch that, three favors. Yeah, I know I'm a handful. The second one, I don't even need for you to say anything about this, but you know the white-haired guy I travel with? Yeah. He's got a sister, and I don't want you to do anything other than keep an eye on her and keep her safe. We're going into the lion's den. Soon, I think. And we'll probably come out of it, but just in case. She's got a lot on her shoulders; you know that. So just keep an eye on her. That's it. All right? And the last thing. You've got those knives I gave you, right? Yeah, hold onto them. I trust you. I need you to watch after one last thing thing for me, all right? It's very important. I wake up Simon, and I let him crawl down my arm. Do you see this guy? He's been with me through a lot, and I don't want him at the bottom of a ditch. I have never been more sure of anything in my life. I want you to have him, and I want you to take care of him. Kynan, I need you to believe in second chances. I believe you. I give a slap on his cheek. Remember everything I said, all right? You're a good kid. (whack) I'll see you later, all right? She should really take one hit point of damage. (laughter) Vax is leaning against the door to this chamber, by the way. I am curious what the Master of Secrets thinks. Asum? What do you propose we do? Cut off the head of the king? You've got nothing? Anything that would piss him off? So your prediction is that we have to slog our way through the outskirts of Emon to fight him on his home turf. Is that about the size of it? So, are we talking about sending everyone we know and everything we have to the outskirts of town-- Yeah. We create a massive fucking clusterfuck on the edge of his periphery and we go for the center. We've probably got a week or two. Well, we take a day or two and we amass every heavy fucking hitter we have, and we do this. What other choice do we have? A lot of us are going to die. Percy, everywhere is at great risk right now. We're going to take a day or two. We're going to figure out how to get who we have to where we need. We're not doing this tomorrow. In a couple of days. Three days. Four days at the most. It's not ideal, but it's what we have to do. It's at least as big as Tal'Dorei. I mean, it's another dimension. Well, we know we don't have a lot of time, but do we maybe want to table this and think on it? They are a rarity. Yeah, that's a big maybe. That's a big maybe. Yeah. It's too late, he did it. Check out the brain on Brad. Oh man, he's not making you roll stealth, motherfucker. Because I would. And Hotis did on me. No it's not. Backpedal, backpedal, backpedal! Yes, we know, darling. We know. Three seconds of costume, that's all you get! (laughter) Do the frigging helmet. I had my arm behind my back for two hours! Commitment! You now look like one of your own bullets. (laughter) What happens if we say no to that? But no one make any mistake. She's lying to our faces. She is not telling us what she wants or what she wants to do. You have a whole plan! Shut the fuck up! You've been droning on for an hour! Shut the fuck up. You're not telling us what you want. You fucking shit bag. Fuck you! Does anyone really believe that this is all going to be fixed if we work with her? Yeah, he's not going to leave his nest. We're also not alone here. Allura, how does this sit with you? Yeah. I feel a little better here. It would go a long way to earning some trust. (whispers) Good luck with that. Hi. Larkin. Yes you did, Percival. Yeah, you shifted gears very quickly there. Uh-huh. I mean, I'm not the only one who thinks she's more dangerous than he is at this point. We've got 24 hours. Is there anyone around right now? 20, natural 20! For perception. Yeah. I said, "Is anyone around?" and I rolled a 20. I know, but you know what I'm talking about. You know what I'm talking about. There it is, it's right there. Invisible fucking Larkin dwarf dragon. All right. That's a 20. I mean for science, right? Let's go. You look really good without a beard, Grog. I've always thought so. Brush cleaning out the fingernails. What's the benefit of working with her? What if we tell her we're going to fake her death, and then we kill her for real? If. We have to hope that she's actually going to fight with us. She's done it once. We don't know that she's going to do it again. We don't know. And you've been working on it for months, and you are smarter than us. Something for Pickle. Yeah, it doesn't matter what Percy says. No, you don't know what she's talking about. It's Esperanto. Anything alive? So you're saying there's a chance? That idea's not grrreat! (laughter) Nope! Just drunkenly popped in my head. Yes. I mean, that's basically what's going to happen. Yeah, I think Thordak's a fucking meathead and we should take care of Raishan ahead of time. Yes, revisionist history. Likely, there's a master plan; we understand. That's the only thing we can count on. Allura, any chance you know the Gate spell? Syngorn. Kima. Allura. Slayer's Take. Yeah. What are we going to do with that money when we're dead? Nothing. Well, we're talking about building an army. To kill the general. We can count on her to be duplicitous. We gather forces; we take out Thordak. We'll figure out how we're going to do it. We're not saying throw every spaghetti at the wall. We figure that out. Then we talk about the real enemy. Well, I don't know how we're going to get the king out of the castle, but yeah. Let's go buy some black powder. This is the time. And he's in 16-bit every time! (laughter) Dumbfuck ending. You've got that gunslinger sneak attack times ten damage against a green dragon. Matt, you've got a little something right-- Just put him on Melrose. (singing) It's Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band.
