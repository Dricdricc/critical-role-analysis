I've looked through it, it's a beautiful book and if you've been a D&D fan for decades, going through the book is like going through a time warp. We're part of the history of Dungeons & Dragons! It's the spooky-ooky one? Creature, just creature. Nutterbeer is an acquired taste. Ooh, a Yorkshire accent. My name is Allison and I am a Horfleporf. I drink a lot of nutterbeer. Probably too much. Am I sharing my special thing you told me about, I don't know? What? No? What? All right. I don't know any of you. I don't care to. Allison's not paying attention and she's making ivy grow out of her desk and around the chair and some mushrooms up each leg of the desk's table legs. You'd have to tell her first. Oops. Mushrooms up the front of your blouse. Natural one. She got it from Chessex. I'm going, too. It's boring down here. Are they winged? (Australian accent) Bacon and eggs! (Australian accent) Fairies on the barbie. Are there any beverages in here? No decanters, no? Have you been hurt at all? Is it locked? Did you try it? All right. I go to the desk. I'll start on the left at the top. Yes? You do it. Itty-bitties? 20. Oh dear. You had 500 people down. Kind of. I'm going to use a cantrip and I'm going to make this wand grow into a full-sized staff and cast Shillelagh. TRAVIS and That's a bonus action, actually. So now I'm holding it. Can I hold my action to attack this thing if it attacks me? That's what I'm going to do. Whack! Okay, so I would attack. Everything is brand new. That is a very terrible roll. That's six. No. That's all I've got. That definitely hits. All right. That's pretty good. Where is everything? That is an 18. I'm entranced with this acorn hat on Laura's head. TPK in under ten minutes. It doesn't look like a dick and balls at all, though. I will stay with the same strategy and I am going to swing my shillelagh like a golf club and see if I can smear that one against the wall closest to me. That's another a terrible roll. That is 13 to hit. It doesn't hit. Swing away, swing wide. No. All right. All right. We're going to send you to Abzkadan. Did anyone at this table equip armor? I'm sitting at a 14. Already? It's already me? That was fast. Do something to impress me. He gets a look and then, very frustrated with how that went, I walk over to the other-- Slytherpin? I point this large shillelagh down just to focus direction and cast Thunderwave against the wall that's closer to it. I was going to try and not hit the Smytherpin, so I will walk up next to Bender, Bunder, Blunder? I'm not going to hit him, I'm going to do it wide of him, and you have to do something, it just shoots out and it's a con save of 15. She takes 2d8. New classes. 14. I turn and look over my shoulder at the jock and just-- Proper rude, proper naughty. These are Slytherpin dice! Can I raid the entire desk while they're all arguing? Is there anything of use? They were all really well hung. Yep, swing away. Moving? Can anyone get it open? Where's the rough one? Well, I suppose you're pretty rough. Can you get that open? Blame it on the fairies. Bob Loblaw strikes again. Guys, K. J. Dowling would be so proud. (laughter) I would like to also, in this room, search behind the tapestries to see if anything's hidden there. We're just going to sneak out of here? What happens when we're not here when they get back? No. I've watched you do it, you know. In the back of three of your classes. I've seen it. People don't pay attention to me much. Why do you care what we think or what others think? I spin my wand and-- it's very pretty, but a ring of flowers making you look like a silly lion appears around your face. (whispering) Wait, wait, wait, wait. (normally) I wave my wand and cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. Plus ten. 28. (whispering) I want to see what the whispers are. Are you sure you're in the right house? 21. Yes, we are. You get plus ten. 28. Flowers again. Do you think you could maybe outline the problem you're dealing with? So infuriating. I mean, we go to school here, so it stands to reason. Every perception it's been two, three, two. Balls. Total balls. Bryan, do you want to get behind her? I'll be last. First of four tonight. First of four. (as Sm√©agol) What is it? How big are the spiders we're talking about? You're the one with experience plugging holes. What is going on? And the Beacon of Hope gives everyone advantage on wisdom saves and death saves. So we need to step on the board somewhere? I would be a knight. I would play on the far side. Your right. No, your right. Do you want to be the broccoli? That is broccoli. I'll go. I will go two spaces forward and one to the right. Nine for me. If Sam doesn't put lipstick on in the Breakfast Club fashion before this game is over, I will be sorely disappointed. One-shots is for prop comedy. In typical Ally Sheedy fashion, I'm going to bite my fingernails and point my wand out, and at a range of 120 feet, cast Erupting Earth under the king and queen. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a dex save. I don't know, it's a 20-foot cube, so that high. Mm-hmm. I'm a witch, it's Schmogwarts. Dex saves. They take half damage from the attack. That's cocked. That's 12, and 12, and two. So 26-- 13 total, and then now 20 feet in the air on a pile of earth and rubble. No, it was 13 each. 26 total down to 13. Halved, yeah. I will use my bonus action to take on my animal form because I am an Anischmagus? A large, oversized badger-- of course-- is now on the field. Sorry. Oh no, I have to move like a chess piece, that's right. So I'm going to not provoke attack of opportunity and come around to the front. Wait, is that what I want to do? Yes. Don't give a shit. Yeah, that hits. Okay. Natural 20. (growling) Badger form. Lair action! Can we move me before I get pawned? As a chess piece-- it's our turn to move a piece, I think. Okay. Okay. Oh boy. Taliesin's killing it. Slytherpin. You got like five bucks or something? Oh, shit! The dice. You're a wizard, Larry! Right. The badger is going to lay into the spider with a multi-attack, bite and claws. First, we'll do the bite. That is an 18 to hit. Okay, so for the teeth sink in and do four points of damage. Then claws. That is a six with the claws. That do not hit. So just (growling) digs to the earth. Not anymore. Hits. (growling) Okay, that's the total? Okay, Ally stands in her raggedy, normal form. What was the total, did you say? Seven? Great. What are you saving them for? I'll cast Mending. I got chills. Ally starts to twist her wand in the air in a big circle and a gigantic cloud appears over the entire chess field and all of us, and lightning comes down on the king. Level three. So that is a dex save, 15. Dang! Oh, that's the wrong die. It's all ten sides. (counting) 22, so 11 points of lightning damage on the king. The storm keeps roiling above us all. Did you have a wand to your chest like Pulp Fiction? (gasping) Come on, Brian and Bryan. Hits. Got it. 16. Big finish. Concentration check. Was that what the con was for or something else? I need to make a concentration check. It was 13 points of damage, and it'll be a ten, right? Yeah, to hold it up. Natural 20. Isn't it that way? Okay, the storm is still roiling and I'm still swiveling the wand and (crashing) down on the big spider. That is another save it has to make. What kind? It's a dex, 15. That's a total of 16 lightning damage. Oh! Molly Ringwald belching lightning. TRAVIS and I turn into a badger. Typical Smytherpin. Actually, Ally uses a bonus action to turn into a badger and grapples Claire to the ground to roll the funk all over her. Oh, it's a badger attack. Hold on. Creatures. That's an eight. Super low. Does it hit the AC? So she dances out of the way? Is it Sixteen Candles now? You have advantage on wisdom saves. The badger is peeing down the front of your-- Yeah, and we have that one moment where they skid around the floor around the corner. 14. I cast Pass Without a Trace! Plus ten with advantage. Jesus, so bad. 15. Yeah. Rolled a two and a three. There was England; Australia; New Zealand; Schenectady, New York.
