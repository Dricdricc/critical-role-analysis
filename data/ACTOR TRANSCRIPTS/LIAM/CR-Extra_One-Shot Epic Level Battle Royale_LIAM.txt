You've got to be careful. Marvel Marketing is going to start stealing from your bucket of tricks. We're going to see trailers with farts. You don't like Witcher, though. Marisha and I came out in another episode of Madness. Some more improvised gameplay with blocks. Have you met Matt? But if we know that in advance. No. Take your precast and shove it in your ass, Keyleth. You need an edge on us all? Using my first luck of the day at the top. That's ten minutes. I'm one luck down. In my luck box. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. 19. Oh, fuck you. Give it to me. She doesn't need it. (laughing) What are you talking about? You are the clear winner of this game! Nope. 32, motherfucker. I rolled a 19, my dex is a 13. Still higher than you. 19. It's a saving throw? Oh, okay. Castlevania teleport mode. Okay, I am sending you something. I'm going to use a bonus action to hide. Sure. Nobody can see me, right? Okay, that is a 27. Here it comes to you. And I've charted this right, I think. Yes. Feel me? Okay. Oh, shite. Yes it is. Heads up guys, my only chance of surviving to the halfway mark of this game-- My only chance of survival to the halfway mark is hiding, so Matt and I will be doing a little bit of texting this evening so I can telegraph my moves until somebody spots me. Yeah-- no! That's crazy! Well, you didn't-- I asked a very specific question and I need an answer. Yeah. Before I can make a call. Aw, great. Thanks. Yeah, that's why I threw the phone down. I know, I know. That's my magic power. Some people turn into monsters, some people hide. All right, hold on. I'm doing my fucking move! Coming at you. Okay, that's what I'm doing. I'm just trying to live to intermission. Come on. Sam, your face folded in the shirt is terrifying. It's better flattened out, but with four folds in it? Terrible. Yeah, I don't know. I'm in this building over here. Yes. All right, here it comes. Boop! You guys are fucking dicks. I chose rogue. This is what I can do! That's it! I don't have any other shit I can do! This is it. I am defensive! Raven Queen take me. Okay. Good, good. Am I out of stuff? Okay, this is real quick. I just have one last note. Just stand there and hang out until three hours of this game are up. It's like at Burning Man. Best fiery running man ever! Rabbit pellets. "That's the thing, though, guys, I'm a really good liar." Is this out of the dick? Tip of the hat. We peaked at the 35 minute mark. The m'lightning bolt. Artists, I've never asked for anything specific. But now. Get it out of your head that you're going to win. Just have fun on the ride. You all are going to die, and I'm going to come out and embrace my girlfriend and let her kill me. That's how this game is going to go. Let her think that. (laughter) Coming at you. It's so good. I'm going to win on this move. Okay. A short one. Did you just make that noise? Zero fucks. Sphere of Annihilation! That's the biggest disappointment you have tonight. You did all right. This might push you toward chaotic good. Full action to hide? It's already sent. Does that make sense? It's movement to go up, is it movement to go down? Got any left? Got any movement left? To go prone? That is the coward's way. Grog, put down your weapon! I was going to kill my friends, but now there's this woman here. Quick question! Already sent. Okay. Is that true?! Tell me after. Okay. Yeah, no. Vax is somewhere going You got this. I would just do it. (singing) I stealthed myself out of the narrative! (laughter) Where's my Colville die? I sent a question and the answer to your roll, too. Sorry. There. Hey man, I took my heart out and did this for 115 episodes, all right?! Staying alive! Die! Take your die of inspiration. Oh, blew your action. This is all I've got. But that's the same shit, right? And nobody knows where I am. I rolled a 21 for that roll. That didn't do it, did it? I sent you my roll. They rolled, so did I. I texted you a 21. Oh, okay. TGIF Flair. Sent you a monologue. To be or not to be! Like the satellite in Akira! I've hit zero persons. Battle of cowards! Same. I have not lost a single hit point, Matt! Guys, the Raven Queen took me out of here 20 minutes ago. She gave me 20 minutes, she said. How did you know that's what I was doing? This is that kid in the GoCart chair that spins and spins and spins. You don't know that. Her miniature is facing that way. His miniature is facing that way. I'm being a shit. Not at all. I started this game knowing that Marisha was going to kill me. Ooh. I'll fucking shank your ass! It's like ten minutes. I'm going to check. I could be wrong because I don't know shit. No! Yes. I didn't play this game. One hour. I'm a druid, yo. Yeah, baby! Good boy. Not metagaming. Baby, are you saving a Wish for me? That's another universe. One's real, Marisha. One's real. I sent a question, and here comes a second question. Here it comes. Got it. Okay. I'm good. So you know what I want to do. I did it already. Hey man, I worked really hard for 115 episodes. Allow me to be a fuckoff. It's the best! Until I die. That's going to shoot off your pinky toe, man! Man, next campaign you're not going to be a meat sponge like this. God, when you play your aasimar ranger, it's going to be so weird. Your kenku druid. Tabaxi tortle half-breed bard. Yeah. Tabaxi with a shell. Does he immediately start doing one-arm pushups? Micro-tears! Troll text, coming your way! I know. Damn it, went to fix a typo I sent to him and it just did it again. It said "basted" instead of "hasted." Oh, okay. So then-- I can do that. Sure! No, you said I couldn't do the first thing. Fuck, man. Okay, can I reverse that? I can reverse that, right? If you go back to the first thing? Sure, but I have a regular action, right? So I'll do it on the regular action. Yes, the first thing I said. Right, sorry. Yep. Good, but, yep. I'm good. On a hasted action, I can only attack. I can't cast spells, which is what I suggested. But if I just flip what I do where, I should be relatively okay. Then I'll do the second thing. I understand, because that's not part of the second thing. What am I supposed to do? Announce every move to you guys while I'm hidden? It defeats the purpose! Dick, dick, dick! I thought you said it was out? Oh, out the door? It's fine, it's fine. So she did it inside the building? I'm not worried. Hold on, say that again? Yeah, that's right. I'm going to use my second Luck of the day. Oh, that's good. That's real good. That's a 29. I am going to die! It's just, later. You three don't know shit. No, man, that's unlimited. I'm not telling you anything about my rules. You can figure it out. Since your husband told you, reaction is if you try to hit me with a sword, and I can only do that once per round. Right, melee attack. Evasion is just dexterity saves. So use that information. You can use that information, Marisha. Dimensions, Finger of Death. I mean it's inevitable. You're going to kill me eventually. It's true! I never claimed to memorize this book, people. Next campaign, I'm going to fuck it up just as much. If that bothers you-- Where you at, girl? 20. Okay. I've got movement, bonus action, hasted action, and my regular action. I'm going to use movement and bonus action to blast out of that door. Everybody sees me arc up into the sky and fly over this tower and disappear here. I'll tell you what happens next via text. Okay. I'm going to elaborate. That's merciful. Nah, water is a minute or less, right? I sent a clarification. Such a question, isn't it? Take me out to the ball game! Too late! That's amazing! Only because you remembered, holy shit! Sam, 20 levels and you haven't got your spells in order? Oh shit, with her wisdom? Good luck, buddy. Oh wow, Matt. Oh wow! I'm going to use my 120 feet of regular movement to fly out of my hiding place into the air. This is probably half my movement, right about there. I can't see, about there. Don't worry, this is temporary. I wouldn't do that. I see Percival, Scanlan, Keyleth. I've used half my movement about, I would guess. And I'm going to use my bonus action to use Vow of Enmity on Keyleth. I want to fly within 60 feet of her using still my base movement. I will use my regular paladin attack, which is an attack-attack, to attack her. Which is at advantage because of the Vow of Enmity. Not great. I'm going to use a Luck. I'm going to use a Luck. That's better. Not much better. That is a 20. Right, so here we go, just a little bit, though. A tickle for you, really. (counting) 28 and that's the first attack and then the second attack-- 28, yeah, total. 28 damage. That was a combo, there was some psychic, there was eight of psychic. Okay, then the second attack is 25 to hit, which also hits, but it's much dinkier. So that is eight. So that was movement plus paladin action, and I will use my hasted action and bonus action. I'll use my haste so I can go another 60 feet and I'm going to fly about there. Then I'm going to use my regular action to-- you guys don't fucking know. I will tell you where I'm using my bonus action to hide. Attack, attack for paladin action, and I still have a hasted action and a bonus action. One can be used for more movement-- 60 feet. Another 60 feet-ish for the base movement to there. Everybody thinks I don't know what I'm talking about! So my base movement gets me to probably about here, and I use my paladin attack to attack twice, right? So I've got bonus action and a hasted action left. That is 120 feet left on one, and then I can use the bonus action to hide. I know! (laughter) Me too! I have a great character planned! I can't wait, but I know that I can use another 120 feet from here to get to there, there, there, or there and a bonus action to hide. It's all in the fucking book dudes! Paladin action which is attack-attack, and I still have hasted action which can be used for movement-- It's right! Hey man, send a message to Mike Mearls about the 5th edition handbook. Thanks, Mike Mearls, I love the handbook. The last anyone saw me is here. Keyleth saw me here going in this direction. (singing) What's that blue thing doing there? It's about to get real on the field back. Wow. Would you know to do that in a frenzy? Okay, I need to ask a question. Here it comes. I'm plugged in by a computer. I'm going to use paladin attack-attack. That's good. Even better. That's 33 to hit. 38 on the first. Does he attack between my two daggers? 38 on the first. 38. Some of it's psychic, but who's counting? Good. 25. That hit? That's eight. I will dump venom into it. You have to succeed a DC 15. Bring it. I was going to say I peeked up, but he's sharpshooter. You've only got four chances. What'd you roll? And? I'll use my last Luck. You have to reroll the 19. Yes, I can. On attacks, yes I can. And it's my last Luck, so your next three are clear. Absolutely can you use Luck on other people's stuff. And I can't remember if it's my third Luck or fourth, so we're just going to call it my fourth Luck. That's a two! You've got three more shots. Of course you're going to shoot me. Good old 11 Lucks Vax. Sure, that hits. I'll use Uncanny Dodge on this one since I can see him. First blood. Just hits! That's first blood. You've got one more shot. Come on. Draw blood. Definitely. Gotcha. Question. Is the green beam still there? Does it do anything? Are you going to tell me later? Just throwing it out there. Those were my two actions, right? I don't need to disengage because I'm not within melee. Right back down. That was-- okay. You should check hoo-ha. Did the green beam do anything for me or did it not work? This is the end. Yeah. I will use a bonus action to dump all my Lay on Hands back into myself. So that's the first thing. And I will-- MATT, TRAVIS, and You know, I will fucking stay put. Then I'll tell you. I'm using a Sharpie, yeah. So from my hidden position, I would like to use ten or 15 feet of movement, whatever I would need to peek out and throw Whisper at Percival's face. Well, I would peek out. I'm looking around and I know that I would see you. I was in here and I'm hidden. Isn't it a sneak attack from a hidden position? I know! So I'm using Whisper. That's good, that's a 25 to hit. I'll bamf to him as I do it. It's sneak attack damage. That is nine plus that is 11. Plus all these guys. Some of it's psychic. That's 40 points of damage. And this is my paladin attack, so that was one. I'm going to use the other attack with Whisper, I've still got it, to throw it at Keyleth's face. Which I will do. That definitely hits. That is a 31. Right. So not a lot of damage, though. (counting) That's 15 of damage. That was maybe 15 feet of movement, paladin attack-attack and I say Oh! Yeah. It really pains me. It really does. I use bonus action to disengage. I have most of my original movement and hasted action left. Disengage. You guys don't know where I went. Yeah. That's not where I am. I just sent it to you. You asked me and I told you. You asked for clarification. I give it to you. So no one would see me as you put me where I am. Why would she be able to go in there? Did she run out of movement, though? Kill me. I knew it was going to happen! Nope. Tonight in this game. Right. I get advantage. 29. Is it my turn? I'm separated with a wall from her a little bit. I'm going to skitter five or ten feet. I know she can hear me, but he can't. Then I'm going to use a little more movement. This looks like a hole, so I'll floof out to about here. I'll paladin attack-attack Percival from the air over the water. Yeah. Oh, that's not very good. That's 18. Hits. The second attack is not, so it doesn't hit, but the first one does and it's sneak attack. That's 18 plus these guys. Here we go. (counting) 40. One attack hit, one missed. I used bonus action to hide, a little bit of movement to get here, attack-attack. So I have hasted action and a lot more movement left. I'll use the rest of my base movement to go. I will tell you where I'm going. Mm-hmm. He projected my position four times tonight. It's just the nature of the game, man. It's my only mechanic. You always said it would be Grog and Keyleth. Matt. One. I was about to say, I didn't stop drop and roll or anything. Literally about to say. Yeah, so I didn't do it. 13. Got it. Great. Okay. I will use movement to get up. Half my, 60 feet of movement to stand up, got it. And I will fly low along the ground-- Are the boots off? Okay. So it's not 60, the wings are up, so 30 feet to get up. 30 feet to get about-- I don't know, can I perch there? Flying low? I should be within 60 feet of Kiki, and I have Vow of Enmity still, so I will attack-attack-attack. This is here, this is here. There's a gap there? Okay. Everybody hates me. That probably hits a lot. I can use Uncanny Dodge on that, since I can see him if he can see me. So, half that. Yeah, you're good. Yes, you are. It's still my turn. Oh, wow, that's amazing. Dagger dagger dagger. Yeah, that's a 30 to hit. Oh, it doesn't matter, because I've got Vow of Enmity up. I was going to say am I still hidden, but I've got Vow of Enmity. That is sneak attack on that. That's 30. 44 on the first. 44 damage on the first? Does 18 hit? You get ten on that. 28 on the third, also hits. That is 12 on the third. Yeah, I'm done because I'm not hasted any more. I used half to stand up and the other half to get there. I used-- it's complicated, folks. Paladin attack-attack and bonus to do a third attack. So I'm done. She's not so dumb that she thinks she's an earth elemental forever? You have an intelligence of one. Suddenly, five rules lawyers around the table. Oh, difficult terrain! Uncanny dodge. I'm going to be dead. I'm a dead man. I would like to paladin attack Keyleth with Vow of Enmity twice. The first one is a natural 20. Let's just calculate that, shall we? That's one. Get all the dice first. (counting) Not that great, actually. That is 58 for the first attack. Eight psychic and double on all the dice. 58. 14. So that was paladin attack-attack. I'll use disengage. I don't want to do the phone thing. I'm going to fly 60 feet, but Percy doesn't see me. She does. I fly to about here. 60 feet. I'm on the other side of this tower. Disengage and then my movement of 60 feet. Here she comes. Percy would have shot me out of it. I stay low. Is it just this island left now, Matt? We're vamping. It's your third try at a form, dude. I'm probably down, then. I'm unconscious. Is there water? The water's gone. I thought you used all your shit to get there. Okay, cool. It's two death saves per. I'm not going to dodge sleeping. I'm two out of three. She's got to hit me one more time. Oh, so the first one's two. Peace! First blood. Oh no, she's down to 106. (chanting) First blood! First blood! All hail the queen! I did what I came here to do.
