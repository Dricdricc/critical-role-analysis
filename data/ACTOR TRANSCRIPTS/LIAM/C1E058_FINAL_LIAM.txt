In person, they look about ten times more vibrant - Oh, that’s easy. Wait wait wait. Is it a sports mascot? It's a sports mascot. MARISHA AND I have a lot of interesting ideas that will go out the window depending on this roll, possibly. I don't like his reaction. I'm going to use luck. I have two lucks left, I'm going to use one of them. (groans) It was on 18 and went down. No, 16. Oh, well. It was going to be really interesting. It went 18, it hung like a half second... 4. I'm wearing my boots, because it's cold. I wouldn't go walking barefoot. Why wouldn't any of us trust Gilmore? Or Matthew? Shush! Uncanny Dodge? Oh, okay. Misses. (funny voice) Uncanny Dodge? Now I can do my crazy-ass shit. So, out of instinct, the heels click together, the boots go on, the world slows down as I speed up and in that split second, in a millisecond, I think, "he's gone to all this trouble to get me here, "the door behind me could very well be locked. "Also, he knows everything. He knows about Whitestone. "If he leaves, he can tell the Conclave "and if I run, he's gone." So instead... he's right in front of me, yeah? Okay. I would like to grapple him. Okay. Last luck of the day. 14. Okay. That's action number 1. Action number 2, I'd like to grapple him. (all laugh) Huh? Say what? It's a 7. Okay, I will cast Lay on Hands on myself. That's an action? Okay, then... I'll stay where I am. No, sorry! Sorry, sorry (mutters). At the top of my lungs I scream, not just in my earring but loud enough for every guard and person in the castle. I scream, "Assassins, western tower and the courtyard! "Jenga!" Yep. Where did my thing go? Okay. Yeah. Uncanny Dodge on it. 20, natural 20. (groans in relief) I did use Uncanny Dodge. I lost track of what was what. Okay. Golf clap. How about a Howard Dean? I can’t see through the corner of the wall there. Is Scanlan like 10 feet away? 5 feet away? All right. I’m going to skirt along on his side, the rakshasa’s side, and shout out, "It’s not Gilmore, it’s a fucking demon!" at Scanlan, and then I’m going to use my first action to try to disarm kitty-cat. What is that? All right. Uh, 16. And this is the next action? 15. That’s still acrobatics, right? What’d you say? This is athletics. Same thing, sorry, yeah. 15. 15. Okay, then, for the rest of my turn, I whip my head to Scanlan, say, "Follow me down. I’m going down." And I want to drag him off the balcony, and go with him. Half-speed. I’m hasted. 12 squares, full. This takes two seconds to go down. I looked it up. 80 feet is two seconds. Really hoping the guards are awake. That was 3 points of damage. So happy! Happy. I assume what I said to Scanlan was heard over earring as well. You’re in a slip or nothing, so. Monster! Heal and run, heal and run, heal and run. That’s why I never take the armor off, guys. Still love me, Scanlan? Fuck him up. Fuck him up. Quentin Tarantino joined. He didn’t redip, though. I don’t remember you saying he redipped, right? He used his poison last time and I made the save? Right? Okay. Sorry. One more time? Yes. That’s just a bonus to do that? I’m unconscious. For my turn, I’ll be dead. So in love with you right now. So in love with you. It was just my turn in the initiative. Can I go? Oh, okay, okay. Okay. I totally - I trust in you, Matt. And fear you. Always naked. Question. Grabbing a weapon off the ground, that’s a freebie, right? Is that a bonus action? I feel like that’s - I think that’s free? Part of an action? All right, great. I’m going to thank the Raven Queen for my family and cast Lay on Hands on myself, take back 5 hit points. I see Mythcarver on the ground. I’m going to grab it and use my movement to stand, and I also noticed that we’re flanking Hotis, so I’m going to sneak-attack the motherfucker up the back. Yeah, I’m hasted. The bonus action was - Oh, no, the action, right. The action was the spell. Oh, okay. That’s okay. I have one action still. I didn’t even - no no no, do it the real way, man. I don’t want any mulligans. Well, let me ask you this because if I understood that I wouldn’t have cast the spell, so I’m happy to skip the spell and then cut the - So it has to go with another attack. Now I understand. So if I had understood - thank you, thank you. I’ll take that mulligan for understanding. So now I’m going to stab him with Mythcarver through the back. And flanked is at advantage, yeah? An ally nearby, was it not? All right, that misses, then. So I’ve used an action but not the bonus action, so I’m going to disengage. And I’m going to dart back, as far away from him as I can get. ASHLEY, LAURA, AND 12 speed - the boots are off. 6, got it. Yeah, got it. By the way, the Whitestone guards are shit. Don’t they stand on the wall? Don’t they stand on places? Whitestone, Whitestone. I know what it means. I do. Sort of. Sort of. This shit ain’t my fault. So cruel, so cruel, so cruel. (laughs) 1. Yeah. No pressure. Okay okay okay. Run, Steve Martin, run. Consistent. Take it, DiCaprio! He's going for spells! Rakshasa. He does want to join Vox Monica. Well, he reads thoughts but he gets them backwards, sometimes. Vox Merkernerkerk. At advantage, being a half-elf. Okay okay okay. Ah, we’re good. It was what he did to me the last time we faced him. Yeah. Now he does nothing at all. Yeah. (sings) We’ve only just met. Rakshasa cannot be jerked. Ah! Haha. Petition to Chris Perkins to rename it “rakasha.” Yep. Hey, I’m in a lot of pain. 6 big hit points. I’ll take it. Yep. How do you get the beans above the franks? Yeah! That’s what I said! Okay, and the first thing I do is shout out, "Blades! I think blades are the best way to go here, folks!" And I’m going to run at him. I think I should get there with 12, no? Oh! No boots! And I’m going to try to grapple that fucking dick. 19. Okay. And before my turn ends, I’m going to pull him in and say, "Fool me once, motherfucker." And whoever steps in steps in. (sighs) Girl… (singing "Whistle Stop") (all join in on different parts) (starts singing Mortal Kombat theme) I liked ours better. (record scratching noise) Damn. It’s like watching the Olympics. 5-9, 5-8, 6-1. Do it, girl. I’m going to let go of him now. Just back up a few. Yeah, we’ll see you next time, shitface. That’s how we did it last time. I think we might need to have a discussion with Vanessa at some point for not alerting us to the fact that this is a - - an ongoing - - contract. I stuck a knife through his throat and slit the front of it. I slit his throat. And it exploded blood all over the ground underneath his big smile - Oh, this is a - A beautiful, bloodied... No, no look at it - it’s brown. It’s brown, it’s earthy. Yeah, but look at it. Can’t you see with your eyes? It's brown. I don’t really want to wear this. I’m a little confused right now. I think I need to - Ah, wait wait wait wait wait - let’s figure out what’s going on! Wait, stop, everyone stop. (breathes heavily) That thing came to me disguised as Gilmore. He told me he wanted to talk, we went for a walk, he gave me this - Full disclosure, we all know he’s fucking sweet on me. We went for a stroll and then he turned into whatever he is and then he fucking stabbed me in the gut. No, he was disguised as Gilmore. He’s a skinchanger. Which means we need to find Gilmore and we need to find Allura now. Ahh. Ahh? It stings? I think. Fuck me! I’m lighter than my sister. Scanlan! Will you grab that dagger off the ground for me? His dagger, the dagger - no, I’ve got your sword. And I toss it as we get dragged off. The dagger. Get the dagger for me! I like them. (groans) This is why I didn’t even bother to take it off. Life’s not that bad. Life’s not that bad. I’ll do it! I’ll do it. Potentially. All right. We look almost exactly the same - Minus that one thing, we are so close. Yeah, but still. Shush, you fucker. But not near here, not here. I walk proudly and naked out of the fucking ziggurat. What's - fucking hell. And I don't even roll for it. (screams) Grog. Grog. Brother, I am so happy to be alive. Whoo. Wait, is this the one? Ugh. Are you sure? LAURA AND Oh, I'm still here? Oh, I'm still here! Let's look at the backside instead. This is a little awkward. Oh, sh - What did I tell you in that tavern the other night? A couple of months ago, I guess. What did I tell you? Yeah, I do. Yeah, that's Gilmore. Oh, not in my hair. It's been a shit night. Who wants to get a drink? (quietly) I don't say anything. I pick the dialogue choice in the Telltale Game, where I say - Oh, no no no. What's up, Stink-Eye? It's probably way too large for you. I'm going to get my shit. (laughs) Keyleth and I encountered him last. And Kash. And I took his last blood, and I heard a threat, but I didn't make anything of it. And here he is again, so I suspect this will happen again? Is there a way to finish it off for good? Allura, would you be able to... give us guidance on how to get to it? I mean, this is a group decision, and I'm not going to be fooled in the same way again. I'm going to be sleeping with my fucking knives for a while. But this will just repeat. How do we get to it? Are you able to locate it once it's reformed? Were there any survivors from our assailants? (sighs) Well, if there are any, we follow it back to the source. (quietly) Also ale. Maybe up the - - asking price on that? (laughs) A fiend? Also - This is not just a vendetta. It knows about Whitestone. It knows about our base of operations. It looked us in the face. It knows we're here. It knows where we are. It knows all of us. It knows him. It knows all of us. When was the last time you saw us before Kiki found you? The last conversation we had. Yeah, good. That guy is a liability. He could rat us out to the dragons. He's fucking pissed off. He wants to hurt me, and now her, as badly as possible. All of you matter to us. I think the rakshasa comes before the dragons. Maybe not before the Vestiges, but on the list. (whispering) Yeah, girl. (zombie groans) I thought it was three. Five? That's good. You've got one more question. Who would know more? Who gives you your orders? He got Akira'd. Broke his legs and his heart never woke. Peeling the skin off my flesh. The Clasp, yeah. It sticks. It's like fucking flypaper. Yeah, it's not a bad idea. You look way better mostly naked, so don't - Ow, that hurts my feelings. I walk over to Gilmore for a second. Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hand that over, big guy. Yeah, thank you. You know everything about everything. It's close. I can agree with that. We found this in a tomb. My fucking rock-hard pec. The ARMOR. I tap the armor, as you fucking very well knew, Laura Bailey. I kind of understand it. Can you tell anything about it? Shush, yeah, it does smell bad. Scanlan gave me some patchouli to rub on it, but it only does half the job. What can you tell me about it? It belonged to a god. Yeah? I know it is. (quietly) I do. Only if I know how to work it. After doing that, I double back and I fly up that same cliff and I lift Gilmore up in the sky. (shouting) You fucking brilliant bastard! Thank you. Thank you. (sighs) This is embarrassing. I float us back down. Sorry. You are a dear, dear friend. You are a dear friend. And I give him a big diagonal hug. A long, strong hug. I am a great ally to you. And if you need any favors, I am your friend. Ow! Where were you, what the fuck - oh, you're - I forgot you were a rogue. Yeah... That broom is really cool. That you stole. Vex'ahlia. I follow her and I stop her and I give her a hug and I say, I love you. I love you. I love you. (whispering) And I'll be less of a fuckwit lately, I promise. (whispering) Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Shaun? Once in a while? All the time? That would have been hilarious. 60. Same speed as my sister. Thank you, Shaun-slash-Matt. (yelling after him) You're hard to read, man! I'll do whatever you do. And I can't use hit dice, right? I can use hit dice? I think it might be more than that. I feel weird. I feel really weird. I'm going to have some - I'm going to have - What's the D&D term for Bloody Mary? I need a mimosa or a Bloody Mary and I'm going to take a rest. And use some hit dice. Hit dice does nothing? What? I open the door, scratching my arm. I don't feel very well. (sighs) I'm just going to ignore that. Could you do me a favor, if you really feel so special to me. Could you get Allura for me, maybe? Send Allura to my room. Where does she - where is - yeah, you've got a broom. You can fly as much as you want, all day. I go have diarrhea in the chamber pot in my room. Does she have that beautiful but messy morning hair that takes two hours to prep for a movie? Fucking wizards. (singing) I say bitch... I mean, you're not a cleric, but - I don't know, he seemed to think he could use your help. Find my dominoes. They’re here. I've got the shits. Bad - what's the difference? I know what you mean now. Yes. Well, I was just - you know, I might be crossing that threshold. And I jump into a side door - - and send it out both sides. Two exits, no waiting. This happened to me when I was six, by the way. I'm talking about Liam, not Vax. (hoarsely) I'm having really bad - I had bad dreams all night long. I relived the moment from last night and I've got really bad... bathroom etiquette. (fart noise) Wait a minute. Wait a minute. (sighs) I'm new to this, but - Can I cast Lay on Hands on myself? Pray to my god. It's the worst. Can you help? (whispering) Fuck. You're not going to slip me the digit, are you? Aaah! (groans) Aaah! (garbled) Grog! Ohhh, fuck. Oh, it's funny to you, eh? I didn't have those. Not right now (retch). No, I stopped it. (groans) Only some of it is vomit. (laughs) How's my intestines? All of it?! Are you sure that won't make me throw up, as well? (gulping sounds) Are there any feathers? Grog, does that thing make mimosas? So studious. Oh, catch it! Give that shit to me. I want to walk out towards our beast here and hold out my hand. I just scrooch under his giant neck. You want to be friends with me? You be strong, I'll be fast. You be strong and fast. I'll be fast. (shooka shooka shooka) She's all right. She's all right. Bloop. Outlook shady. (laughs) What she does to waste a spell, you can do as a freebie. And you're so nosy, so it's perfect for you. Is there anything we can do to help? What do you mean? Here. You take this. Should you need us. We're going to make you a beast. Yeah. Beast. (laugh) It's a fudge. It landed on a blanket on an angle. (giggle) Bulletproof to peer pressure. Careful you don't get velcroed to her shoulders. Are we going already? I mean, do your work tomorrow. Can't we get shitfaced one last time? Roll to attach a Baby Bjorn? Oh my gods. Playing a long game. (giggling) Wow. Oh, you devious motherfucker. It's very aerodynamic. If you're going straight up. Can I squeeze in one mini-conversation before the end of it all? What, you? I don't want to talk to you. I think we all want to say goodbye to Pike. That's what I was going to do. All right. And I sit down next to her and I scootch her a little bit. Thank you, Pickle. I'm starting to gather that you don't have as many answers as I thought, but be that as it may, you're still a great inspiration to me. I still feel like I'm following in your footsteps. Take that for what it's worth. Yeah. It is. It is pretty cool. Fuck, we're going to miss you. If you need us, blink of an eye. Blink of an eye, we'll come back. We know. It's going to hurt, but we know. And you know that we all - all of us. That big asshole over there. My twin, with the - She's behind me, isn't she? That one. Red, Whitey, Shorty. We're all going to miss you. Cheers. (toonk) (sighs) All right. I'm going to tie one on. Thanks. Or say nothing! (giggles) (laughs) - into my sister's room with a bowl of lukewarm lentil soup, and go, "Oh, god, I'm still sick. (vomit noises)" And throw it all over her. Whoo! Still got it, baby! And I run back to my room and go to bed. I'd rather go to the lady spas. Bye, Pickle. All right. We're really doing it. Ready, Stubby? (gibberish noises) (laughter) (Brooklyn accent) We're going to Florida! (cheers) Yeah, Grog's girlfriend. What did they do in there? We don't know, still. And our discount! No! No! Yes, it is. Us pack of nerds are going to miss you more than Vox Machina misses Pike. We're going to miss you. Pike in a box is better than no Pike. MATT, TALIESIN, AND
