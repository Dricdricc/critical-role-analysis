Yeah, I'll tell you who's coming on by. Sure, I'll say who's coming on by. Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Ashly Burch. And I don't want to spoil it, but Matt knows. It's different. It could blow up in my face. If you don't slow your roll, Loot Crate is going to poach you. Taking the initiative. This one came to my room, then inside. I think we've probably been quiet for a while, staring at the ceiling, and after a while finally say We've really fucked things up, haven't we? I need to tell you. I know with all that's happened, between my new patron and my sister pretending to gag literally every time we attempt to share a word together, and mostly my own being fucked up in the head for weeks now, that I've pushed all of you away. You most of all. Because I've been afraid you would-- I'm sorry. And you didn't deserve any of that. Keyleth, I need you to know, through all of that, everything, nothing has changed about how I-- We've had so many near-misses. And now, finding Tiberius. Death is unavoidable. And it's all the more reason for life to be lived. And it doesn't matter to me what this is. What we call it. If you are willing to spend some time, any time, with me, then I will simply count myself lucky to have it. You're very dear to me. Maybe so. (sniffles) I'm sorry. I love you. That's pretty fucking great. I tackle her into a bit of a hug into the bed. We're already on the bed. Sleeping in. And the means of travel is? When we were last there, hadn't they talked about a brass or bronze dragon? But there are brass dragons, as you well know. Is that overkill? We'd have to convince a dragon, not capture a dragon. He wants to help. He does. We don't necessarily have to sacrifice a dragon. We're fighting a war here. They're fuckers. Well, I'm talking about a dragon. Couldn't we try to talk a dragon into helping us do what we're doing? They're not all evil, are they? They're not! We don't have the troll dick anymore. That's gone. I was about to say, yeah, we put into the contract that it has the remains of the beast we take down, which we will take down. Sure, as a souvenir, right. Yes. It's a very large creature. But that could happen with any contract. Any band of idiots could go die on the battlefield. I look at Grog and see he's really bored. I pick up a wooden sword and I hit him as hard as I can on the small of his back. It's not going to be that hard. 17. Come on, big guy! I know you're bored! Come on! I hit him again. Okay, cool. That's a 20. Oh! But it's with a stick! Just strength modifier? Oh dear. I'm going to use Luck. 14. I missed the nut? Ugh. Come on! Come on, take a swing! I'm trying to do you a favor! Come on, get it out! I see a gauntlet on a table, and I throw it at his face. It's a one! (laughter) Yes. I'm going to dodge. Uncanny Dodge, man. Ooh. No, I didn't miss that. Wait, I'm going to use another Luck and make him roll again and pick the lower of the two. Got to roll again for the hit. That hits. Uncanny Dodge! And in the distance you hear (strained) I feel so alive. (laughter) There's some blood and five long, dark hairs on them. Vex. Help me up. Not going to use them right now. Just a hand. (groans) That's going to bruise. Worth it. (sighs) I know. How about a fucking clipboard? Percival de Rolo, Inventor of Clipboard. He did talk for quite a while. Again, please? LAURA and Well, you've got friends, don't you? No. Where is that coming from? But you can't address it. You just have to let it be. I'm not going to encourage it. I'm not interested in him. I've got enough complications around me as it is. It's true. I've got a little bit of luck. I'm a lucky guy. Shaun? Shaun! It's us. Are you home? I wish I knew more about Loot Crate right now. Different than Loot Crate? You're not able to leave, are you? We walked into a sort of political snafu because we didn't know the lay of the land, so is there anything we should know in advance? What was that name again? Shandal. We got a jug. No, go ahead. Is there anyone you haven't seen in all these years? We would like nothing more. I think we're on the same page. Birds of a feather, you two. Sherri. We asked him, but he's modest. How's he doing? But all the same, that is a very good idea, Grog. A rift just opened in the universe. Well, we're going there, so I'm hoping either you can give us a lot of tips so we don't run into problems, or I don't know if anyone can take your place right now. Do you want to go on a field trip? Yeah. Forget it. We need all the knowledge in your head, in ours. I haven't stolen anything in years. What can you tell us about him? Or her, or it? What story is that? Brass. On par with Emon, the city? Bigger? Smaller? And you're sure we can't talk you into going? Percy's giving out titles. Bleep-bleep, yes. No stealing. Got it. Is there anything that's offensive? We don't want to offend anyone by accident. Can we bring you anything back? I would love to do that. We'll keep an eye out. No, you've done way too much for us. TALIESIN and Stretched a little thin. Five gold. Mark it off. (laughter) I break into a cold sweat, thinking about the desert and this armor. Oh shit. Yes, Percival. I have never needed your intellect more than right now. What is the solution? And I can put it over everything else? Cloaks, plural. Fucking 90 episodes later cloaks, cloaks, cloaks. Yeah, it's to bounce the heat off. Liam knows science. Vax doesn't know shit. What were you doing? We haven't even gone to Marquet! Not going to touch that one. Pretty much. Ugh, Grog's pec is right in my eye. I think he stabbed my eye out! Jeez! I'm going to do my due diligence and make sure the door's okay. Probably is, but just in case. 22. Just to make sure that it's not trapped or locked. Yeah, you're going through Shaun's shit. What are you doing? Speaking in Half-Orc. Don't speak that. Can I read your diary, then? Is that all right? Yeah? All right. I didn't say it! Just maybe he wants a little privacy. I don't know! Think about it. If 25 opens the door, then it's opened. Yes, for quite some time. Yes, and brave. Is there anything we can let him know? We will. No, but if you could point us towards fusaka? Is there any around here? There's not, is there? He's pulling our chain. He's pretty cool. Be pleased. They were a couple of sweethearts. Throwback Thursday. Is there enough moisture in the air? I have no idea how it works. Do they speak Common? Hey, that's a step up for us! Are we still clouds, though? Can't talk at all. We did it, you guys. We made it to Burning Man. There's a Vestige! They punish people for nicking things. I don't think we want to try to break in. We're still a distance though? Where we are, from the guards? I don't know. You want to make a mystical door floating in the middle of their tents? In this world, on the ground? I love it. We haven't done it that much lately. Percival said he already un-misted. We can all do that? Scan-man, let's start by playing nice, please. We know nothing about these people or the customs here. With a door floating in the air. I'm going to not say anything but do the "be pleased" motion. Well, I'm doing it, as well. Scanlan, why don't you hang with Percival? I go in. We've had old magic, new magic, strange magic. I'm going to stealth back to my room. No worries. I got a one, but I'll use luck. Two ones! Oh hey, hold on a second, though. No, you make jokes, but I want to go into your room for a second and talk to you. Take a full minute to get over it, you fucker. You really should have gone into acting. It really was your calling. Yeah. (sighs) Sorry, I'm a little discombobulated. I've never rolled two ones in a row. I know this is a really stupid time to talk about it, but we never get to talk to each other, and I have a serious question. (nervous laugh) Relax. In that tree, that guy said a lot of fucked-up shit to you, and it just sounded like a lot of fucked-up shit and him trying to make you feel bad, so fuck him, right? Fuck that guy. But he said something about a dagger? And I saw your face fall. And I asked you if you were all right the other day, and I think you might have not told me the entire truth. Are you all right? Yeah. I could be dead tomorrow, Vex. Right now. About what, about you being shitty? Fuck that guy! I want you to tell me about the dagger. I want to know about the dagger, but I'm serious, fuck that guy on the rotten branches he was growing out of. He's not right. Your strength of character runs deep. Fuck that guy! It breaks my heart to see you doubt yourself. You have always been a wonderful woman! I'm not saying you have to be a fucking beefcake; you don't have to be a soldier, but-- Whatever the case, you are a good person. All of them know that. They all know that. None of them doubt it. I don't doubt it. I don't have the words, I just want you to believe me. I'm not eloquent like Percival, but I've known you a long time. You are a good person. Forgot what it feels like. What's the dagger? When? You'll have to be more specific than that. Originally? Yes! I thought it was a terrible idea. I was dead wrong. What? The paintings do all have holes cut in the eyes, so you can never be sure. The people that took you. The people that took you from me? Are you just creeped out because he knew or because of what happened? Why are you upset? Well, listen. I wasn't there. I don't know what happened, but... you came back to me, so whatever happened can't be wrong. Oh, come here! Come here! If somebody took you from me... I don't know how to see it any other way than I do. You would have to do something really terrible, Vex'ahlia, for me to ever feel disappointment in you, and you have not ringed that bell. Rung it? You studied harder than I did. Goodness, please. One more time You are a good person, and I've always seen that. Please see it, please. Oh god, my heart is breaking. (sighs) You've always been bold. That's not a crime. That's all right. I feel like a boy again. Well, no, but-- Vex'ahlia. Vex. Vex. Fuck, I'm just going around-- I love you. You don't have to talk to me about everything, but if you want to... if you want to. Should you need me. All right. Sorry to babble. I'm not going to answer that. I'll see you at breakfast. And I walk away. I'm afraid not. You unlocked "Ravioli in Marquet!" You're really pale, too. First chance for violence is all yours. You're the first one in. Go for the top? J'mon Sa Ord. He's well-behaved. Is it the beard? Medium to high. Are we certain that that will hold any water on this continent? Sam? No joke, thanks for the ab workout. (laughter) (deep sigh) Also, while she's rolling, do we all see people eyeballing him? I would like to walk by, and as I'm passing Vex, I'm going to do that thing where you walk past a friend and you do that sideways kick in the butt, and I'm going to go stand by Grog, and anybody I see giving him the evil eye, I'm going to match it back. What do you want to see, a show? And I don't like the way these folks are looking at big man, so I'm going to stay by him. I'm watching him. I take a moment to marvel at how a being of such ferocity and power can be such a doofus at the same time. It's amazing. It sounds like fun. Why aren't you a crime kingpin? Five plumbing washers. Sounds like a sad man right there. Where is he? Well, shit. Shorthalt? Cardamom. The hell you haven't! Pike hears everything. (laughter) I walk over to Keyleth and say I've done this, but I don't think I knew what I was doing. Your people do this? You've done this. Now we really need to do it. Hey, can I see that ruby you found before? You'd hold out on me? Why are you lying to me, Grog? All right. What an episode! What an episode. I will go with you, and I will hang back, and I will be there to stab out the eyes of anyone who wants to hurt you, but you are the talker, man. You've always been the talker. Well, let's be real. She's the coolest one in the group, really. Can she take it off at the casino, though? I did it before, but I don't think I really did it. Yeah. I copy Keyleth. (coughs) I just, (coughs, sniffs) I can't stop (coughs) coughing. (coughs) I'm fine. (coughs) It's really good. I agree with you. I feel the opposite way. I'm very proud. Let's keep them sheathed, he said at the gate. But we are pretty hidden. Hey, can you hear me? Yeah? You all right? I take them by the cheeks. Can you feel this? TALIESIN and You can? Can you feel this? TALIESIN and Do you recommend it? TALIESIN and I am not going to have a sip of that right now. Definitely sometime, but-- Yeah. Just these two? Yeah, you're both really cute right now, but you're useless. Yes, what are they harvested from? Hey. Can you say your full name right now? And your deal is this evening, yes? We have accounts from two different people, and they're two different opinions. Is the armor similar to that suit of armor we saw on the other guy? I'm going to hang by the two sobering-up twins over here and keep an eye on that person. You don't know. I've been watching. There's no place for our friend to get into a scrap? Sorry, big man. Tablespoon of Wrath. (laughter) I heard Grog. I'm going to follow out the door, go stealth. 22. That is 25. Shaded hallway? I'll follow. At a distance. 24. 22. 25. You said, "A Kingly Home"? I'm going to stealth back to the Debt's Respite. Hey. Took a little walk. Sure. Grog, you want to bunk up? Yeah, there's six of us. I know that. I'm not going to go lie down on the floor. I just thought I'd call dibs. That's later. Yeah, so we've got a backup plan because I followed whoever that person was back to where they dropped off. We should probably honor the offer first. If that goes sideways, then we have a backup plan. Absolutely. Well, I don't know the names of the streets. I remember what it looked like. If you want to follow me, it's about a mile off. It looked like a furniture store. A Kingly Rest. Wonders never cease. Well, the casino's tonight. The deal's off. We can't get Grog in a fight. I'm starting to take a nap against a column standing up. Come on, snitch. We've got hours and hours before we have to do anything. Gameshega. Gameshega. Put up or shut up. We were convincing. It's the only plan we have. I've got a party planned for you! The desert awaits, Matt.
