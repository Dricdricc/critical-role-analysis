If there's one place to use the flamethrower, I think it's on that. I was being facetious; I didn't see it. I'm so comforted that it's on your wrist right now. I think the one that I'm the most nervous about receiving in the mail is necrotic. (laughter) I got it! I'm walking very cautiously. Hey, come here, big guy. You smell like, ugh. Come here, you. Tousle. I don't think we almost-- (softly) Hi. What could go wrong? We've done worse things to each other. 20. I'm in front. Grog doesn't know that! (laughter) We're here. We're with you. What are you looking at? Like spider webs? I don't see an eye. Is this where the burning happens? Was this in the fine print? Are you the one that's going to be doing the branding? Smooth. Join a few more clubs, and we're going to be all sleeved up. How far does your vision fall? Peer into the scatological. I have some questions, though. What is this relationship, you and us, now? Are we obligated? What are your allegiances? To yourselves, to the guild? Or to Vasselheim itself? You're a fast counter. 630 each, 630 for Scanlan, as he is not here to do it. Why, yes, Scanlan. I will take your share. Thank you. I noticed Vanessa has some cookies on her desk. Would somebody hand me one of Vanessa's cookies? Thank you. They set my nerves at rest. Killed a what? Yeah, it wasn't a guy with a cat hat. He was a demon. Yes. What? Girls like me! That's not hard to believe! I can sell that, right? Percival, back me up, please. I noticed-- Percival. Your coat is all frayed and fucked up. What happened to your coat? The dragon breathed its fire on you? Again? Scanlan. Lift from the legs. (laughter) He did. He was a noble fellow. Having a bad day. Yeah. The cleric was nice. He planted one on Keyleth. You want to explain it, druid? It's a funny story. It's really funny. Well, there was this acid pit, right? And we all got on top of the carpet, like we do. And there were these giant magical sigils that borked the carpet. Which was fine. It was fine, because the thing started to go down-- I grabbed the carpet, and I jumped and put my own body, up to my fucking head, into the acid. Burned. Yeah, you see this? You see this little bit of gray? I held the carpet up, and then it's funny. We both sank together, and then the carpet went in the acid. But it was still okay. It wasn't completely destroyed. Just a little bit, but only completely. Tiberius-- It's very comfortable to step upon, but it doesn't fly. We're still alive? In our defense-- Is there a tavern anywhere nearby? Let's go to Kraghammer! Like holy shit. A blessing from Sarenrae. Or an employee discount? Ask Merkin. He can tell you. Look at these badass tattoos! Yeah, look at that. Welcome to the Critical Role comedy hour, folks. Make sure you hit the two-drink minimum before you leave. Keyleth will fly you back lickety-split, just like that, yeah. Oh. Vex broke the carpet. I tried to save it. Six. So what are we doing? We're going to go shopping for potions, and then we're going to go see Kiki's family, yeah? You can't see it, but if you rub your hand on his chin, you can feel it a little bit. Make a wish. Wish on the carpet-- oh. Are you shopping for a little buddy? You know how to use a blade, Tiberius? I'm walking over just to watch. You got a taste for the knocking-about, fighting that thing, didn't you? I bought them for you. That's more interesting than the bolts. Tell her to get in line. What else do you need? It's all on me. If you hadn't stopped that shithead from leaving, I wouldn't have put a dagger in the back of his head, and we would've been looking over our shoulders for who knows how long, so everything's on me. Whatever you want, tell me. Not a carpet. I can't afford it. Welcome to Agrabah. You drive a hard bargain. One time. One big time. Money well spent. You've got no idea. I fall in step next to Vex and look at her for a second. What's burning your arse? We still have a keep. She started before we got here. Just keep it coming. Thank you. I lift up the cup and keep putting it in, and say, a round of the strongest on me. I've got that, as well. You know, he needed a little-- it was really rough going, from what I hear anyway, and he needed a little therapy? We were also talking about visiting Keyleth's family. Can you get away long enough to-- Tell us again. Sorry, explain it again. Whoa. Hey, Stubby. Wake up. It's nappies time. Nappy time. Just give her an hour. She'll be fine. Side note I'm two inches taller, and I've always called you Stubby. Come here, Stubby. Here's what I think. Lady Keyleth has been talking about this for a long time. It's calling to her, and we're a family now, and it's her moment. We're here. They're right nearby. There's no use putting it off. Let's go to her family. Could she have one more? You need one more, Stubby, then you'll go to bed, all right? Then you'll go to bed. I'm taking Trinket for a walk. For dookies. Oh, wow. Like a pseudodragon. Your bear shat like a fountain. Wasn't solid. I don't know what you're feeding him. It was a little runny, sorry. Roughage. He needs roughage. Oh, but he's a little cutie, isn't he? I've always wanted to see a volcano, anyway. Keyleth, I saw you pile-drive a beholder. Pretty sure you're going to be all right. Can we see Sunder Peak from here? Matthew, we've been doing this for three years, and you still fucking blow me away game after game. I'm sorry. Tyriok, I meant to say. Well, we need horses, right? We don't want to walk. Oh, we're getting more? Did you bust up the last one? Trinket could take Pike, too, with you. He called you a lady. Is there any moonlight? Tibs. I pull off and hand him my Cloak of Elvenkind, which is one of the reasons I'm so hard to see. Maybe we could just use that as a shroud for it, just for tonight. I'll pass it to Tibs. 900 at night, you said? I think it's time to bed down. I mean, we're not in Los Angeles. Are you haggling with the fabric of time and space? I pass the fuck out. And you're on watch, right? Before I passed out I handed him my cloak, all wadded up in a ball around it, and handed it to him. That's tight, right there. Yes, thank you for introducing that to Liam's vocabulary. (gasps) I'll take the first watch next time. Everything's good. No use crying over spilt milk. Let's keep going. Yoink. Thank you. (whoosh) The lowest you can get is ten. Or 11, really. Is it safe to just approach? This is maybe awkward, but you and we share something in common. Our past is awkward. I get the sense that yours is not as much. Your people, are they a mix of many kinds? But predominantly a melding of humans and elves. Friendly fire! We just hit 7,000 subs when Orion set himself on fire! Yes. So you're a silver-colored dragonborn now? Judging books by their cover, yes. I ride my horse around in a circle just to face everybody and say, everyone, maybe go a bit back, go behind Keyleth. Vex'ahlia and I will trail just behind as your retinue. We need her clear, Tiberius. 15. Two paths, Percy? Let's choose the one less travelled, then. What do you see, Percival? Are there trees to tie them up? Yeah, the one that Keyleth's people, or cousins, or whatever they are, have been taking. I think we need light so we don't go over the edge. How did Trinket do? Mighty two. Oh, right, no. 15, sorry, 15. For stealth, right? (coughs loudly) Can I clarify something? Am I giving Scanlan a shoulder-ride right now, or is he knocking boots back in Vasselheim? Yes, I call it a tiefling trio. One. Take that, game, take that. Everybody stop! Keyleth! We just wait or Keyleth talks. Wait. I kneel down toward Keyleth. We're doing it. I look to my sister and grab her by the shoulder and squeeze. Then I dive in. 16. Cloak of Elvenkind is with advantage; would that take place here? Plus ten, 38. 13. Oh, Jesus Ballsacks, who art in heaven. 19. Yeah, it's fun to say. Thanks, bud. Stealth. Dexterity. Damn it. 27. Stop, drop and roll, man. Keyleth's right up against that elemental in front of her, right? I'm going to run right behind her-- No, I'm not. I made the save. I click my boots together and I run up-- Right, so I'm going to swing up underneath Keyleth's arm, and then I've already clicked the boots, so dagger, dagger... dagger. So 22 on the first. That hits. All right, there's the sneak attack right there. This is the Keen Dagger. Good, there's ten, plus-- did he make an attack already? He did, right? Damn it. Ten. 13, 14, 20. 20 points of damage on the first strike. Second strike probably misses. 13. Third strike is a 19. Does hit. All right, and that is nine. So three plus six, total of nine? No, it was fantastic. That hits. Oh, fuck a duck! Total. LAURA and Skadoosh. Everybody's glistening. Water. Against everyone near him? Hell yeah, that hits. Yeah. I made a stupid pun, and you tripped me and made me eat shit. Enjoy. Excellent. That's excellent news. I'm going to use my bonus action to disengage. I've got three things I can do here because of the Boots of Haste, so use bonus action to disengage. I'm going to use one action to run like fuck over to that wall and jump to the side. But I can still move my normal speed, right? All right, so I'm going to run as far as I can towards that wall. No, that wall. And then I'm going to roll on the ground. (choked) It's okay, right? The cloak's okay? That's my woobie. Is that Draconic? TRAVIS and Reality is malleable here. Oh yeah! That's good. Yeah! I'll take it. Natural 20? It could be your pubes! Don't jump to conclusions! Okay, so Cerkonos is still busy with Keyleth, so I'm going to take a split second to inhale, exhale, and then (dagger noises) right from where I am. So 18. 14. Natural 20 for the third. Do I get to pick which one is the--? Okay, so the first one hit, which is sneak attack, so that is four plus seven is 11, plus-- 14, 17, 23, 25-- 31 for the first hit. Second one, which was a hit, is-- which part gets doubled? The dice roll. Four plus six is ten. That's it. Yeah, that's it. I'll back up against the side of that wall that's right there. But that's it. (gunshots) I'm reaching out and clasping Vex's hand as we run forward. Ten. 14. Oh, you bastard. 25. What about my sister and Tibsy? Because they rolled a one. And not tomorrow please, but where do you need to go next for this quest of yours? You're an important figure to us as well, Pickles. Just put your faith in Sarenrae. Tatonka. That would be good for anybody. Sleep on it.
