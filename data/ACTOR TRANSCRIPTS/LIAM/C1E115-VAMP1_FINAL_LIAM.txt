So we're all vampires tonight, right? Is the camera even picking us up? Can you see us? I was just testing you. Scanlan and Grog. Each of us alone? I got a ten and this X-ed-out one. I figured as much. Is there enough room to bring my knees up and start pushing with feet and hands? Who's that at the window? Hunger! Ooh, hunger! Am I so distracted with my face-- Okay, all fours, pushing. (grunting) I don't like it in here! The red is a ten and a two. And then a nine and one on the other dice. So success, success, failure, failure. You don't pinky swear with evil people. She has to roll three of them. You can't see his penis any more! I'd like to rap a song with my knuckles on the wood to try to get somebody's attention. Fucking Chobot. Yeah! Can somebody get me out of wherever the fuck it is I am? I can hear you, dick! There's a rat in here with me. Ooh! Is my face okay? It feels weird. What do you mean? That makes me sad! The fuck are you talking about?! And a success is--? Yeah, of course. Sam, are you okay in there? Do we have our iPhones on us? I'm sure it's just a couple hours later. We'll get you out of there and we'll figure it out. And brawl? Here comes my two big dice. What are you doing? I'm judging you hard. Real hard. What? We're in the studio! I mean, it's a little fucked up, but I rolled a ten and a seven, did we get Sam out? Sam! Husband, are you okay? It's a process. I'm used to that. I'm going to drag my hand through the writing on the wall, to make sure that it's fake blood like syrup. That's right, it's food, right? Does it taste like maple syrup? (lip smacking) Just my fingers, three fingers. Oh, I wipe a letter off the wall, and finish that off then. Yeah, that's fine, that's fine. So, we're going to find a phone, we're going to call your nanny. You and I will get out of here, we'll get to your place, we'll get you home, and then I'll go home. I would assume. Where? Crit! No, she's Laura, she's not Laura. She's Laura, not Laura. Is it as we remember it, or is there debris everywhere? You're crazy. Ugh! Doesn't matter! It's just like the end of the Vox Machina story! Goodbye! No! She came out of the server room and went into Nerdist? I'm going to follow her. Dani! 30 feet behind. D? Dani? I don't remember exactly what's in the Nerdist offices, but it's full of shit. Is there anything I could grab as a weapon? I'm taking it. MARISHA and Dani? What's going on? Do you know what's going on? Is this a Geek & Sundry thing or an LDN thing? You've seen his head. I set Chun Li down on Dani's desk. Dani, we're going to get the fuck out of here, and we're going to take you with us. You need to tell me what the fuck is going on so we can work together to get the fuck out! You are talking like a crazy person! Fuck it. I pick up Chun Li and I back her up. Does it look normal in here? They're not, but the room? Key. Key, buddy. You doing all right? Key. Buddy. I voice Doctor Strange. You love Doctor Strange! Key! Can I poke his face a little bit? I'm going to poke it. Oh shite. It's a lot of pressure behind that screen, man. Failure on the non-reds. Charisma and persuasion. Yes. Yas, Key. Where the frig is persuasion? Where is it? There it is. Four failures, the red is a nine, and a non-red success. Two successes, one of which is on a red. I only have one red die, though. And I smell my finger. You've known me for so long. What is it? Are you aware this is not a normal situation right now? Smell the siggle. Wait, Eric, did you get your suit for the wedding? Why are you always the one who picks up the ashes? I'm with Marisha in the office. Meanwhile, back in the office This is why I never get in the middle of G&S conversations, because you guys have your own language. I never know what you're talking about, and it's best that I just stay out of your way. No! I'm going to start scraping them off, if I can. Okay. Just straight, right? That's a failure on the red. No it's not, it's a five, and ones are the only failure. So one success. (shouting) No! She's a mushroom. She's a mushroom, look! And I push into her shoulder. Where's Matt? Don't drink the tea! She drank the tea! I literally just bought a new suit. It's a good suit. Hey, just a side note. For their wedding, I bought them a big block of tickets to Hamilton, and they can't use them now. I get that. Would you like to see Hamilton again? I mean, if anyone wants to buy them off me, I'll cut you a real good deal. Wait, what's going on? I mean, not on me! But I could never tell you where they are if I'm eaten! Wherever Sam is, I am now. He's big! Do Laura and I also see a changed shoe? We all see a changed shoe? Is that your vampire power? Open your mouth. Can I see anything? Is there a void? We hit them, they fucked with our brains. Yeah, Arcade, are you good? You all right, La? Why are you--? You need chapstick? I'm pulling Sam away for a minute. Whispering. Listen to me. Those guys, I love them, but they're married and-- I'm saying that you and me. You are my best friend! They are my best friends, but they're married! They have to help each other! I'm just saying if things go pear-shaped, I got you. The wedding is probably not happening. What's up, yes? And it wards off Christians. I am having a great time. Let's put that over our head. Do you need this back? Here's a heart, sun, bottom left is face, bottom right is a cross in a circle. A little wooden stake. And so much good role-playing. (Snagglepuss voice) Oh, exit stage right, even. (Snagglepuss voice) Heavens to Murgatroyd. It's probably Rachel Romero up from the second floor. You're getting pink eye from that. Poop in the eye, yeah? What's Travis doing right now? I catch up, put my hand on your shoulder. That is sick. And I'm sorry and I use Presence Awe to say, you really need to keep me safe so I can get us out of here. Yes. Okay. Just one. So it's not charisma plus persuasion? Charisma and persuasion. That's what it says. Hunger or charisma plus persuasion. This is the scariest thing yet. I rolled a four on the d10. A single d10 or-- so I roll too? Charisma plus persuasion? Two successes. Yes. Five successes. Everyone here, I don't know why, likes me. I'm an idiot, but they do. So you keep me alive, obviously. So you keep me alive.That's an auto-fail. Well, Matt ended and Marisha ended. What? All right. There's no people out here, right? The "drink me" and "eat me" people were all back in the Nerdist offices, outside the bullpen. Can I go back? I forgot something that I wanted to do. Back at the office, inside the bullpen. I'm back at the office, outside the bullpen where the door was shut. Who all's wearing these signs? It was Arcade-- TALIESIN and And the sign says what again? Don't judge. I bite Arcade's neck. TRAVIS and I am. I use Dread Gaze and inspire unbearable immobility. Charisma plus intimidation versus charisma and willpower. And failure is a one. So one success. No failures. Okay. I grab a couple of t-shirts and I push-- The StayTurnt t-shirt and the Dungeon Master t-shirt. And I cover his hands up and I say Can you just give into it? You know, this is terrible for both of us. I know. But it will all be over soon. I mean, we're through the looking glass here, Arcade. I'm really sorry, but I'm going to try to bite him again. Yes, please. Strength brawl? Brawl's nothing. So strength brawl plus two. Okay, it's not good. I got a fail! Two fails! One on the red. Fuck it. I whip around and turn on Chris. That's better. That's two successes. Yeah. You can't get rid of the other one? So you always keep one? If I'm okay-ish, I'll hold off. I'll see you later, though. But everybody likes me here, Travis. Is there any other weapon-y stuff in the room? Is there anything ridiculous like-- Yeah. All right. I swing past the office supplies and grab a fistful of pencils. You also have no idea that I just drained Chris' neck. That's a bad idea. Well, we wanted to find more weapons. I got a bunch of pencils. Maybe other people are vampires like us. My internal monologue right now is really pissed off that I did not get to taste Arcade. Yeah, you just come from your car right to this table, so there's a whole bunch of areas you don't know about. I'll go with Sam, because we got to stick together. You can deadlift a house! You can't bust that shit open? Let the right one in. We might have faintly heard (muffled noises). Daddy Chops. Is that true of his sideburns as well? Let's go, vampire. Oh shit! Two failures. TRAVIS and You're rules-lawyering a game you barely understand! Time for a Taco Hell run. He's real big. That's five. You get four, right? Three, plus? Get that Big Gulp. Why did you hit the mouse again? Can we lower the gain on the mic, though? Or a horse. We're in the bathroom, right? No, we left off of us ages-- a while back. There's nothing going on in the bathrooms. We could keep going back around. There's conference rooms back there now, where they keep all the games where you shot The Slayer's Cake. Those dragon torches are there, too. Did she believe you? Are you sure? I know. I will lead Sam-- unless we see something of note. Sure. Do I see anything-- There is a little bit more. There's a couple of conference rooms. Glass doors, windows. Yeah, we're walking past these shelves of tabletop games. Yeah, sure. I also failed on a red. Two successes, one fail on a red. If we get through this, we have to record another episode of the podcast. And not one that we do at the convention, Sam-- You never edited it, dumbass. Yeah, we got to release that one. There's another one. Just you and me. She's nowhere near us. Oh, the voided room is back here? Oh, I didn't realize where it was. I know what's in the actual building. I didn't know the void was back here. And do what? What, to fill the chairs? What kind of game is it? Straight up, do you think this is safe for me? What do you feel? For me, I mean. Okay. Dani? Is he a speedster now? You're certainly the most clever person at the table. It can only go right. Uh-oh. Spaghetti-Oh. You're not hungry any more. At all? But we could have used him and gotten an answer. (singing) Shot to the heart, and you're too late. Is he bleeding at all? I'm going to come up behind Laura and press into her elbow and I'll press the blade in and use Awe again and say Ivan, I mean it's really all about leverage, right? We need some information and I feel like we've earned it. Charisma plus persuasion. No. Charisma plus persuasion and one hunger die. All right, what do we got here? Nice. I've got two successes. Oh, that didn't work. Yeah, all right. You think we're at Burning Man right now, don't you? You didn't. Hail Satan! I didn't see you! We are in a Looney Tunes. A cross in there. I thought he was scared of scary stuff? It's a death note! Step one Eat bloods. She rolled a cocked dice and got another failure. Two failures. One success. Both red. Two failures. Nothing. Three successes. Here with the tabletop games on the wall of board games. I'm hungry, too. I'm going to help you look. I'm hungry, too, but could you wait for just a minute? TRAVIS and Just a minute. Man, I'm hungry. Yeah, that's a good idea. I feel like it would be good to have a snack. Guys, snack, up. I'm all right with that. Everybody knows Travis loves you. It's obvious. That's real good stuff. That's all success. Every single one. I bet that smarts. (groaning) Wow, you love me. Dex two? Shit, shit! Two fails. One success, two fails. One's a red. I feel so crazed! It's Romero! Two successes. I grab Laura and say Listen, he might die. He might die, and if he's gone, you and I are going to need each other. So you need to keep me alive so I can protect you. And I use Presence Awe on her. Four successes, one of which is a red die. There is no versus on the sheet. Four. One of them was red. It was a crit. Well, I need two crits. I mean if Travis doesn't come back, or if he does come back! It's wise to keep me alive so I can protect you. And you love Laura, so to keep her alive-- Reverse math? Three. I need to live! So I can protect her! Uh-huh. Well, you're stronger than me. How am I going to protect you? That's silly. Tal, I never got a penalty for what I did. Laura, where'd you go? No. I think I would be a good ways behind big man, watching him work his magic. Gary Gygax is no longer living! Still not in, and I'm unscrewing two pipes for a microphone setup so I can have a bar in my hand. I'm not here. I'm quietly looking for Laura outside of the Critical Role table. (whispering) Twinnie! Twinnie! Laura! And I dive over to where she is. What do we do? Blam, Blam, Blam! Yeah, everything else on pause.
