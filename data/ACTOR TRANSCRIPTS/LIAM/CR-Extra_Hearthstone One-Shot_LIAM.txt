It's been a while! So long since Matthew Mercer ran Dungeons & Dragons! Three just came out. I just read five, and it is so baller. Oh my god. Also, to rewind, that beautiful art on that book is by @NatRoze. Roze with a Z. Made that ages ago, and Laura's been in love with it for ages. That is one shiny bear ass. We tried to get you to talk about killing your friends and you would not do it. Why won't you kill your friends? What's the matter with you? New episode of Madness came out! We have this guy to show. Oh! This is the shirt for Sagas of Sundry Madness. I am a Jenga pro! If you want to learn how to play Jenga, you must watch Sagas of Sundry Madness. This eye glows in the fucking dark. I surprise myself, let me tell you! I think this is Ivan van Norman's eye. I hope it's his eye. This is a little weak. Do you have anything stronger than this? All right. Log, then grog, yes? Yes, my name is Quazirat Toluus. Quazirat Toluus. All ten, yes. I am Draenei, wear all white at all times, top and bottom, underneath and front. Whole nine yards. I am simple man. I like to test myself in battle for the glory of Argus. Every day of my life for the glory of Argus. I also like to sample the fine spirits of the realm, and I am a big player of MMORPGs. I like to unwind at night when I am done killing the Burning Legion. It is LRJenkins1234. As long as it's white. And I was going to ask for a couple bottles of your best vintage to be added to the agreed upon price. TRAVIS and Will it mess me up? That's a deal. Are there any markings, footprints, different toe patterns, any kind of clues? Yeah. I was actually asking the DM. Do I see, with my Draenei eyes, as I stroke my chin tentacles-- On my chin. I don't like to draw attention to them. That's right. Yes. I'm making an investigation check. I'm rolling a d20. That's not very good. That is, hold on! I've just solved the entire game. That's a two. There were candles here. That's a good idea. Okay, that's better than us. So you go from there to there, and add that. You can also tell there were candles here, yes? Intelligence modifier is up here, yeah? Five plus-- Oh, so intelligence check, you say? Intelligence check? Well, then it's just that plus-- where the hell is it? There it is. What about paht-pourri? You're dropping off the T. You're fucking with me. Probably unrelated. You first, little one. There's also rocks on the ground. Yes. Is there room for our World of Warcraft pauldrons to go into this space? Either the small magic one or the sneaky one should be going first, I think, yes? All right little stinker, let's see what you can do. All right. Dramamine, lead the way. It would be better because here's the thing, even if you are supremely sneaky which you are, I'm fucking bullshit with sneaking so we all have to, you know, pull our weight. We'll see how I do. Three! And I lied. Five. Yeah! They'll never see us coming! (shushing) What happens is he will create the environment and the things around you and you interact with them and you roll dice occasionally. You're in control of your personality and the actions you do in this world. He's the world. There it is. Oh that's shnazzy. Yeah. What is that? And we've been trailing the elf, so-- I think it was more than nine so like ten candles. Eleven, probably. We'll find out if we kill them. You just said candles a lot of times. Where are you? This is the time. All right. And it's at advantage because she's hiding, yeah? Yeah, so roll it twice and take the higher one. So it's a 17 plus your attack from the crossbow is a 25. Plus eight. So the damage is a 1d6, so you roll one of those cubes. Okay, three plus your sneak attack damage which is at your level-- Plus the five. So we're seeing what the order is so roll 20 again and add this. And then keep that number in your head. For a moment. You changed it, roll it again. Well if you know what it was then keep it. I can't read your die Jen! Yes, that's good, that's 23. Okay. Just remember that. Why can't I roll well? Okay. 11. J-E-L-L-O. 11. 11. Quazirat. Q-U-A-Z-I. To hit you roll d20. So roll the roundy and add your attack bonus for crossbow. Yeah, so now you're just rolling d6, a cube. And add a five. So yeah, roll d20. Dexterity save. So what you get on that? Ten plus that is here. Nine. And this is a save, not ability skill, correct? Oh, that's big 11. No. I don't think so. Seems fake. On other side. What's the length of those bridge, guesstimation-wise? Five total two on each bridge, big guy other side. Big is relative term. Is there a clear path between where I'm standing and either bridge? Yeah, that sounds fun. I'm going to run for edge of bridge on this side. How far is that for me where I'm starting? That's good. I like it. 15 feet is good. I run towards edge. Yes. Sure, that hits. No, eat shit. No. I used 15 feet to get here. I'm going to do my running long jump for 25 feet over 20 foot bridge you describe to me and land on other side. And move up to this asshole on other side. Oh, you think I would understand this mechanic before this moment in my life at level seven. What kind of check? Okay. Oh, not great at all. But I get to add two because of Remarkable Athlete, so hopefully that's enough. 14. I'm how far from him? Oh, well I'm going to take his head off. I had a pet rat but I don't care. Here we go. Oh, that's a one! But I have an extra attack, so I will go again. Oh, that's so bad! That's a 12. I'm using greatsword. I'm going to attempt to embarrass myself further and use action surge. Colville, don't fuck me, Colville! 15 for the one. But this last one is okay! 17. Yes, finally! Oh Fievel, your troubles are just beginning. That is ten slashing damage. Kiss my sword. The hilt says Leeron Jenkins. Let's get this shit started! So, you attack this guy, you get sneak attack damage because I am right up against him. Acceptable risk. What'd you get? Plus your crossbow-- So, 1d6 to start, then you add the other cubes. Okay, that's good. Plus? Nope, you cannot do that with bonus. But is she up against any kobolds at the moment? Well, the best you could do with a bonus is maybe to disengage. Which means get away from them so they cannot hurt you. But you cannot hit again with-- That's good advice. Just dance back a little bit. Oh good, yes. He's got lots of candles! Yeah, that's good. That's 24. I'm trying! It's a ten. Okay, so you did quite good with 22, yeah. Does she have evasion? Zero! Because rogue is best class. 14. You want to take like five, or maybe even 20 minutes here before we go forward? I don't know. You know, conserving energy, that kind of thing. Let's go! You want to kick ass, I can tell. Little one, let's go. He tossed it at the DM. How are those tunnels coming? You've made them, or making them? Safe passage, convince him? Oh, yes. Bring closer. Your hands, what I like about them is they're so little (bones snapping). That's a 17. Okay, I can do this to you five more times. I can play this game all night long, little man. So we need to get inside. We need to be, you know, alive and not getting killed, so we would like to keep you. She has lots of beef jerky, we could feed you. But we can't have any, what did you call these? Well let him earn it first, you know? Maybe, 20 minutes we're still alive, you have healed hand and more meat. I'm not holding you. You gave him to me? I like this guy. Pat pat pat. Well, I went like this. I thought you were holding him. You know, Dungeons & Dragons is funny thing. Your mind's different from my mind. Who knows what we're seeing? I drop his ass on ground. And I kick him really hard in the ass. Lead the way. Lead the way. That's you. You take look. Make sure it does not explode on you. This plus this, so plus eight to what you roll. I don't like mushrooms. And the rope is still trailing from him? Depends on what we think biggest threat is. Touching mushroom, breathing mushroom? How far away can you cast that shit from? What if we all back up to our different sides, yeah? Get back as far as you can and we'll get way the fuck back. See what happens. I mean, to begin with you're not alarmed by us being here in the first place? I grab rope that is holding Reekcheeks and bring him over. "You know this one?" Is he problem? I punch him in the eye. You've got to keep them in line with tough love. Give it to Mikey, he'll try anything. Everything is crystal clear. In another life, I would have hit that guy before he said a single word. I would have dropped his ass. Good news, my brothers. We come from both the future and the past. Let me tell you. Your fathers are proud of you. I've been this fucked up before. Your mothers love you and are proud of you! Persuasion, you said. That's 18. And the deep secret is You know that I am you. Doing inches this way like an arc. And Papa and Mama don't want you to hurt you! You have to love you! Give into it. Oh, that's a 20! Show the Feywild! We are such fake nerds. TRAVIS and What are you doing? Did you eat mushrooms? You were talking out loud to no one. I think it's your own positive nature, speaking to you from yourself. I mean, that's up to you and them. I don't know shit about that. Mind over matter. Aerwin, do you see anything hinky in this room? Anything off? Bad? What's that? Okay, that's 16, plus perception. And we're standing here talking in this chamber. That's good. You're going to be good. Acrobatics, you say? Well, that's iffy. You know. But also tempting. Because what did they have when they died? I can chuck you over. Well, yeah. First one thing, then the other. I'm not going to fall. You were staring straight at me. Oh, yes. Now you seem sarcastic, because you're rolling your eyes. There are these big bruisers floating there, staring at us. You can fly. I have seen you do it so many times. Can't you skirt the edge of this room and go over there? You don't need to go through this guy. Sure, see if there is anything worth, you know. This is what we live for. I am not going, too much hassle. Look, Laura, you're finally doing it. I also talk to you. What kind of blade? How big is this thing? I would also, but I would do roshambo with you. Okay. Best out of three, or just one time? On four?! I have intelligence of eight. Throw on three? Why are you changing it on me? Let's do it on two. We go one, two, shoot. Okay? All right. One, two, shoot! Oh shit, two papers. We go again. One, two, shoot! Give me that shit. You seem very crazy right now. Hell yeah. I am attuned to nothing, so I will attune to this. Yes. This was made for me. Should I be describing this to the table? Yes, this is called Adventurefury, Blessed Blade of the Thrillseeker. This weirdly pristine longsword is encased in meticulous, almost gaudy, gold scrolling and rune-like carvings that spell out phrases like, "Carpe Diem", like your shirt with donut, and "You only live once." You gain plus two to all attacks and damage rolls made with this weapon. You are immune to fear and, if you ever attempt to flee from danger, you must make a wisdom saving throw, DC 12. On a failure, you instead rush toward the challenge in hopes of glory. YOLO! For Argus and for LRJenkins1234. Hey, Shakira, do you fear me? Good, that's all that matters. Let's go. 20. Natural 20. Is it the Warcraft dancing animation? We are problem solvers! Aw, I don't feel bad. Why is that? Not Toddlewaddle? Something else? What did you say? Yeah, but I have to share. Speaking in accent, but out of game. As a former rogue, boo-hoo, this one is asking me if assassinate is good in this moment to get a special surprise attack on gargantuan-sized dragon. Yes. You would almost definitely hit dragon, but it would be like taking donut and hitting side of Empire State Building. Absolutely you will hit, absolutely. You will take off half of one scale of dragon. I mean, you can do it. This is Dungeons & Dragons. Do whatever you like, but I'm just saying, the game will end in two minutes. I am curious to see. Tempting, tempting. Yes. If anyone's going to fuck with that shit, it's going to be you, but it's still a big if. I also have a question about this item that I'm attuned to. Let's say that this one's not crazy enough to grab dagger and we just want to go by. This says that, if you ever attempt to flee from danger, you make wisdom save. Does sneaking by--? I just wanted to triple check. Part of me thinks it would be hilarious to see me rush in, but-- I elbow the gnome and lip sync, and I say, chain. I know. You all need to go through because, you know, I'm so big and heavy. Okay. So you want to try to tangle with the devil and try to take this blade? Hm. And what is the landscape like from where they are to where we are, here? Here's what I think. If I fucking move, big noise, jig is blown. You need me to stay still. So you do your thing and if it goes well, you go and then I go. If things go bad, we all die together. You know, no promises. We'll see what happens. Good luck. Stealth, oh. It's a one. Does she have--? She does not. Does she have what I had? Oh, too bad, so sad. LRJenkins1234! Running forward. So you're there. But this is where you're at isn't it? Or is that where you're at? You shouldn't be there because you can't go higher than that so now you add 16 to that and that's where you are. So 45 add 16. Yeah. 24. Oh shit, that was Vax's voice. Five plus whatever you roll. Party? I'm running at dragon. Yes. I'm not running from dragon. Couldn't if I tried now. Well, maybe I could. Nah, I'm going to dragon. Yeah. First one is 17. Of course not. Second one is 25. Yes, it does. Okay so that is big damage, 16! Oh buddy. Let's go! What did you get, what is that? That's seven plus your dex but it's still not great. Not me. That's not bad. 22 total. Ain't no thing but the chicken wing. So these two are down? Get the hell out of dodge. Okay, this is bad. I'm stupid, but not that stupid so I'm going to run towards these two, to dwarf, yes? And use action to cram potion healing into his mouth. Wake him up. Okay. This is a potion of healing greater. 4d4 plus four. That's the end of turn, yes. That was action. Wait, hold on. I will use bonus action to do Second Wind on myself. No, that's fine. That's three, yes. Only hits a little bit, though. Everything's going to be fi-- Yes, okay. Yeah, you know, always living. I'm going to flee from the dragon. We'll see how we do! It's a big 13! 12. Let's get the hell out of here, you guys! Blessed Blade of the Thrill Seeker. Eh, too much hassle! Go! 24. See what you got. Ooh! She needs 20 minutes with that. So we should probably, you know. Where are you at? I don't like that music. I don't like it. I've seen you two in action. What if she fires and you follow with fire? No, it's not, it's much higher. 30. That's cocked. So what's the higher one? You're doing crossbow? 1d6. Roll a cube. Three plus your sneak attack damage. And we're going to double this when you're done, because you're an assassin hitting in the dark. (counting) 37, because you're an assassin. Every kobold is the best in this game. Big ten, my man. Let's go, wee one. It'll form back together though. Everybody say crack as much as you can. Okay, and your buddy is there so-- Not hidden, can't do that, but you're still going to get sneak attack. Yeah, you're going for an attack. Is she at advantage because he's stunned and weird? So roll twice. Oh auto-crit, so you don't even have to roll. Well, yeah you hit, 16 plus eight, so 24. So you roll-- 1d4, which is the triangle, the pyramid. Roll that. Okay, now you roll your-- four, good. Roll these guys. Okay, roll those. Holy shit, that's a good sneak attack. 22, wait, you double it, because it's an auto-crit, so 22, 44 plus the three, is 47. Oh, you have smoked this guy. Ten. 57. Yes, you can disengage as bonus action and get away from him so he can't hurt you. Dance back. How far away are other little guys from this one? Ten feet behind him? Then I will use my whirlwind warrior class ability, and I will start with the big man and move to his little buddies. Okay? So here we go. So I'll start with him, yeah? So I get two attacks because of who I am, that is 16? Not great. Okay. So am I at advantage because he's fucked up? Okay good. That's better, that's 24 to hit, that hits. Okay, here we go again. Okay great. 14 on this guy. Keep going? Ever hear of Baryshnikov? Amateur. Do I roll for attack on each one? Okay, here we go. First one, we get 18. Second one, we get natural 20. Third one we get one. Fourth one we get 28. Okay, so first one we get 18. Yeah. Okay, so second one critical so eight, 16, 18, 24. Oh buddy. And the last one, 14. Life comes at you fast. Sure does. Stop, drop and roll. You've got six seconds, that's what your turn is. Right I see the little one go down, so I start hoofing it in that direction and I plant my hand right down on her little forehead and I use Gift of the Naaru. And you get seven hit points of life. But then I keep running past her as far as I can go. That's fine. Sure, that hits. Towards the latrine. Which is technically fleeing, so do I need to make saving throw with sword? Okay good. No. That's not good. That's a four. YOLO. Bozhe moi! But am I out of movement and I'm stuck where I am? Yes, I am. I take the sword. (guitar solo) Is that a dex save? Is Lohkor adjacent? No, you're doing the crossbow, you said. You can do the dagger. You cannot fire it. You can throw the dagger, or you can fire the crossbow. So 1d4. Roll the pyramid, then roll your four cubes. Add that all up. No, you can't do another attack. You can use a bonus action-- Okay, so I'm on fire? Fuck it. I run, and I attack. I shout For Argus! And I run forward to him, and I would like to attack-attack for my attack, but then also use my recovered action surge, so I'll hit this fucker three times. First one is good. Don't distract me! Is 29. Fine. Is 17 for the next? Okay. And last one-- oh, balls-- is 20. That's good shit, so here we go. First attack-- oh, that's terrible!-- for ten? Second attack that hits is 18, so a total of 28, all told. It's all right. I hold my ground and block my friends. Don't act surprised, Travis. We know you're going to be a Sleep magician in the next campaign. They look so innocent when they're asleep and on fire. I'm in his grill. That almost doesn't hit, but it does. Totally cool. So 18 and 21? Cool. Let's find out what that does. I'm not down, but-- okay, cool. I'm up. 15. Oh, you're picking it up instead of attacking? That's your call. Plus, what is it, seven? No, she's up. I think of my father, Leeron Jenkins, and I run. I run at him, and I attack again. Yeah, okay. First attack is okay. It's 22. Second attack is a 21. Okay, first time, we get 18. Next one, 16. That is so cool. Yes, it is. Still up. Next round, for sure. Sorry! I have a bonus action. I'm going to use my Second Wind. Thank you. Go. I recovered it. I used it once before, we took a short rest, and this is the last time. Oh, I'm an 18 AC. Do svidaniya. (groaning) Still conscious? Still alive. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Pots. Is Lohkor adjacent? Okay. Yeah, you hit, so a cube, plus sneak attack damage. Four, plus these guys. Yo. I'm good. On the thing? About 20 seconds have passed. Should I make another death save? What happened? Did I get him? What are we doing? Right, so we make a run, and I make a wisdom save, and I fail, so I turn around and go back. I drop my candles. LRJenkins1234! Rise up. Also, did his spell reach three miles back? Will one of you please look after my WoW account?
