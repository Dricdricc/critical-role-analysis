Oh. Okay. Are we in? Okay, we're three minutes away, we're told, from playing Dungeons & Dragons. Roll for jelly beans! We're using only these tonight. Look at this! Sneak attack damage! Ooh, strawberry and watermelon! You cannot have any. Whoop! Oh my god, you broke my phone! Look at Sam. He's so serious about this game. He's so serious. He's too in-character. Here's mine. You've seen it before. It's the one with daggers built into it and I can stick it right into Laura's ribs if she makes me mad. She hasn't made me that mad yet, but it's inevitable. Oh, sneak attack! What about you? Do you have any dice? That's some Hell Raiser shit right there. That's bag number 22. Look here. This one was given to me by Matthew Colville. It's made from a meteorite. It's iron that fell to the earth and it's made of aliens. Look, there's the dungeon master over there. He's thinking about killing us all. Ooh, snap! You guys are all asking questions. Okay. Here comes. (cheering) Look. Check this out. Look at this asshole over here. Oh, he's in Hawaii, sucker! Listen. We don't know what's going to happen. We're contractually obligated to having a possible TPK every other week. Get your Imodium ready. Get your whiskey ready. You should take Fart Detection and Fart Silencing. What are you doing? What are we talking about? I think you should level up into barrette for your bangs. That's a challenge!
