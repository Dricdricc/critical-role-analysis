What are they? Go get 'em. You got to go get 'em. I thought we were en route when we ended. What's in that pack? There was a pack in the bag. 50-50? By the way, did you see anything when you crashed through? Were there people on the ship? So probably dead. A little creepy, but a very good job. Have I got about 30 or 40 minutes left for the wings? Yeah, I'm going to fly out over where the ship was and see if anybody is doing the dog paddle out there. Boats, there's little boats! (singing) Hello, my name is Simon. 17. Wow, I did that too, except I went Into the Woods. Boogie board. In character or out of character? Bye! Into your 5,000 hit points. Hopefully you're close. How far away did I get? 60 feet, yeah. Yes, then I would like to fly straight at the maelstrom. I would like to do that, actually. I hope so! I hope so, and is that Trinket right next to it? Then I will get sneak attack damage and I would like to use, oh good god, Divine Smite on the attack. Right. All right. That's a 20. That's a 30. Yeah. It went one, 19. All right. So we start with a one and then we add these. Two, three, four, nine, 15, 20, 25, 28. Plus Divine Smite, since this is the first time I've ever done it, is 2d8. What did I just get up to? Shit. TRAVIS and 28. Thank you. Plus Divine Smite is 20, 30, 38. So I used movement to get there? I'm going to swipe again, because I've got the bonus action? Love it. That is 24? Yeah. So excited by the Divine Smite. There's that. And that is a little bitty two plus six is eight. And I forgot to add my bonus to the dagger before, so you can make that 14 for total damage. I'm a real paladin! Glass as well, or--? Air elementals. Disadvantage against me. Nope. Sorry, Charlie. So much math with this thing. Oh yeah, go around Jesus. Are you sure dragons are real? (scoffs) So offensive. I'm still at 99! Yeah, I'll roll a one on my next level up. (laughter) Oh, let me see what my constitution bonus is. Oh, it's nothing. You're a bird. I say, I'm going to have to kill you, dear boy. I am so ready for this. Hit me. Subtracted from me instead? He never gives me inspiration that often. What is it? I have a rules question, DM. Normally when I attack one character, one attack gets sneak attack, but can I sneak attack the one behind me and attack the other one that's by Keyleth? I've got friends around both. On one, okay. Then I'm going to shank backwards to the one behind me, and it's flanked. There's four of us around it, so advantage on this one. Okay. 23. This one. Three, plus (yelps) four equals seven. 28 on that one. I was hoping that would happen, and then I'm going to dive and roll around Keyleth and stab the next one. No, I meant to run that way. Can I run through it? And attack, and that was a 23 to hit. Which is a big seven. Strength? Damn it. I'm going to use Luck. Ugh, screw you, inspiration die! I mean, thank you for it, but still, screw you! I'm going to use my inspiration on top of that. Oh yay! 16? Damn it, Gil! How much damage was that? Six, okay. I'm dead. Who's missed? Is that all? Natural 20! I want to take a little run towards the water and then shoot out and do what I was trying to do before. Heal his face. His face is cut up, I say over the earring. Am I seeing anything out on the water? That is a 22. All right. I'll shoot back. Oh yeah? I'm going to go drag them back. But one, I can? I will drag one back. Your shame? You mean your pride. I drag one back. Can I stay close to the surface of the water? All right. Just an 11. I'm going to imagine that my wings bamf out soon after that. I'm going to search him. He's dead, yeah? That is a 22. That's the first gold I've had in ages. All right. That's a-- you know what that is. Percival, what is that? That I've got in my pocket? Isn't that for looking through? I take the two small stones and I look over at Percival and Keyleth and go-- (laughter) You can have it. Hey, pass that back. That's mine. No, you take them both. You've got the broom. Are the twins quietly in the lead? Yeah. Buddy, bud, you're very big and large and amazing. What do you want? I give him a small piece of glass from the ground and I put it in his hand, then I run up ahead. Try it, buddy! (laughter) All right. Acrobatics. Yeah, that's fine. 30. Wait! I'm going to use luck. No, didn't go up. (hoarsely) Fine, take the lead. I'm keeping the stone, dick. (hoarsely) Right this way, stealthy motherfucker. 25. 26. But we can navigate through? I will come back, I promise. Do you want me to go look? I'll come back. I'll just go look, I promise. I'm going to stealth my way forward. 31. (imitating Grog) Don't make a sound! Oh, I'm stealthing onto a battlemap. My proposition was to leave you all and go look and come back. To look. Can I use detect evil? Yes, it is. You're a wannabe. You're holding back. Divine Sense. The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor. No, divine sense. Use this feature a number of times equal to one plus your charisma modifier. That's right. Three times I can do it in a day. Fancy me. Oh. Okay. Good thing that I'm being quiet, so I'm going to still creep toward the whispers. What do they look like? So goliath, Ripley, and the third. What does the third look like? I go back. And I go directly towards Percival. (quietly) She is there. (whispering) Shut the fuck up! (quietly) She is there. Grog, there's a big woman of your breed there, and a third. I don't know what. I don't know if it's a he or a she. I don't know who it is. From my vantage point that I had, how far away was I from them? We can overtake her now if we go right now. Do we want to use these? There's a big woman in there. She's all yours. Eight point eight? Like a 1980s Halloween mask? Shazbot. Mister Belvedere. The third figure is by Ripley. The goliath is off on her own with some sort of box. I'd like to not go direct, but slowly start creeping around through that green. Is that a he or she that I'm hearing? Is it a surprise at this point, or no? Is it blown? Okay. 24 on Ripley. I get sneak attack because I'm first to go. It's not surprise. All right. Fuck. (counting) 34. 34 and the second dagger will go as well for seven. Plus poison. DC of 15. Did the poison take effect? Can I hide again and circle around further? 25 on stealth. 22. I knew it. I fucking knew it. I'd like to throw at her again, as well. I rolled a 37. Does evasion factor into this? 28. Vegetation is gone here, right? And everybody sees everybody, right? 15. Fate, hate, whichever. Six of one, half a dozen of the other. Chickens are all coming home to roost. Yeah, seconded. That's eight percent of your hit point pool. Disadvantage because of the cloak. Nothing. You didn't hear me. Which one? I thought that's what he said. The one in the far corner is not the one that you whispered about. Who shot at me? Fucking hell. All right. Oh shit. The one in the far corner is the one my sister attacked? Then I'm going to follow up. Yeah, I'm Sharpshooter. 29 for the first. The second is 26. Yeah, I know. That is eight for the first. Nine for the second. Can I use the rest of my movement to drop behind the tree and go into a crouch? Yeah, so I'm done. You have no template, it misses everybody. That's how it works. You don't need those. Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys! What a visual! Tickle on his nose. You're welcome for that armor. Percival fan of comedy. With disadvantage. That hits. Loses it for the rest of the round. I'm fine. Oh, can I uncanny dodge? Or is it too late? He can go all night long. Off that roll? Holy cow. I would like to use my movement and my bonus action to run. I want to beeline towards the rogue. How far do I get? Yeah, straight towards him. I don't care how close I get to the other two. Crevasse. I'm running. That's as far as I get with movement and dash? A bonus action dash? And I'll use my action to keep going and as I close in I shout out Kynan! You're with us! You are not with them, you are with me! Stop this! Move behind us now! They don't know! They don't know. Charisma roll, persuasion, anything? That mage is right on the nip. Anything you do, we will turn into preschool, Matt. Right up the hill, gets kicked back down. Get some ouchies in there. He diarrheas on himself. Apropos of nothing. Hitting zero's unconscious, and then going past your total HP kills you. If you don't go higher past your total HP, you're still at zero. 8d6 coming your way, papa. Oh, shit. Concentration's gone. Everybody wake up! Sorry, Wile E. What'd you roll? Shush! I'm there, you're there. 80 feet apart. It's not your turn! If you want to save her on your action, go for it. DM says what? Kill, Grog. Kill, Grog. Oh, stop asking for anything. I want to start moving toward my friends. How far can I get toward Keyleth and Kynan and Trinket on my movement? Athletics, you said? Seven. On my movement? What happens with my dash and my action? I'll do it again. Fucking A. Nine. Again. Natural 20. I'm going to shout Kynan, you have a heart! Think of Emon! What are you doing? It's not too late! 17. No, sorry, 19. I don't know what it means, but it sounds good. Where's Kynan at? Is he out, or is he just standing there? I'm going to use my movement to get to Percival. Close enough. I'll use my bonus action to get all the way, and I'll cast Lay on Hands with my action to get him on his feet again. Five hit points. Kynan. You're all right. Balls. No, not bad, because I'm a rogue. 17. It's like, heal! Boom! Heal! Boom! Heal! Boom! Hey, everybody wake up! That is a 17. I rolled a six, plus 11, is 17. That hits. That is a 28. Okay, whatever you say, boss. That is a seven. This is a shitshow, man. Ash-o-lee! Vestige. Like water splashed on a cat. That is insane. I'm conscious. I'm going to use people being around Orthax and stab him a couple of times. Then can I go three squares north to the edge and hold my attack until someone steps up? Within melee range? Then I will continue along the edge to that pointy crack in the ground so I'm out of range. That's all right. At disadvantage. Misses. No, go. Is she next to him? Right next to her? I'm going to attack now. First one is a 17. Second one is a 28. So first one, with sneak attack damage, is (counting) 38 for the first. And second one is ten. So 48 in total. I'm so cool. Yep. Been there, done that. Golden snitch. Grog! Oh, Grog! Tilt! Whose turn is it? I'm going to attack Orthax. He's got people around him, yeah? I'm going to use Sharpshooter on this attack. That's a one, so that misses. I'm not going to use Sharpshooter on the next one. That is a 24. (counting) 31. And I'm going to use-- shit. No, I'm not. Where's Trinket? In the necklace? I'm going to stay put. Yes, we are. I'm walking over, as well. Yes. I'm ready. Stab. 26 and 22. I want to sink my dagger into her arm, sever all around her shoulder, and rip her fake arm off of her body. You can't stabilize him. Some of us do.
