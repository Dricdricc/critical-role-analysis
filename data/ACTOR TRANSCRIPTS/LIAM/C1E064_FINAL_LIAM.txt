It gets you in, and when you're in, you don't want to get out. I'm all growed up. I have something very delightful planned. I would like to announce that I am so goddamn happy to be back in this room. What's going to happen? Guys, drama needs conflict. Hot damn! Keyleth just brought us back. We're back. That's true, but it's irrelevant. What the fuck are you talking about? Maybe you can work it out? Are you certain you're not trying to do comedy right now? It's not in this realm. There are more worlds than these. It says life-- (laughter) It grows on you so quickly, though. Eating chicken that he found on the road. Speaking as Liam, remember that this is a man who gave an evil sword-- he gave crystal meth to Grog. I have no patience for any of this shit. Well, Percival, look at this. Show him the bow. I really don't think we need to worry about Grog so much. I think he's fine. But that can happen today. Guys, let's just go find a wizard and some alcohol, in whichever order. Jabba the Hutt. Not that grand to me. I start walking off towards the castle. Come on! Just eat your pigeon and come along, Grog. You waded through blood, Grog. Sam, you can do this to me too. Which we don't know-- I thought the guy told us we'd have to figure it out. Did he whisper anything to you? Oh, you read Elvish? You're partially elvish. The only important thing on that paper. Vel'ena. Vo'el'ena. How long? Where? Shaun's still in the city? And Greyskull Keep? Shivering horde of dragonborn. Fuck. The city was razed? And the will of the people there? I walk up to Shaun and slap my hand on his forearm and say, what about the bow? Is there anything you can tell us about the bow? 26. They know we're here. This is not a coincidence. They're not flying by. They know we're here. They know. Do it. They're coming for us! What are we looking at from our vantage point? We're up above, though? Or are we on ground level at this point? We have time. We have time. Good work. Good work. Think of what he's losing, though. Just say thank you, Percival. So fucking method. Method, man. They're long gone. It's really good for people without flying brooms. There's a dagger, there's a cloak. Armor. There's a staff. Can't we drop it into the Clasp's pipeline? They don't like each other, though, this is some sort of loose partnership. Even if we don't, they probably are going to get much more vindictive overall. Can I do an insight check on Asum? First one was good anyway. Damn. I can choose whichever one I want. 21. Sam who are you talking to? You're facing a potted plant. Hey. While everyone's sitting, can I just pull him over to a corner for a second? How are you doing, personally? Yeah. Shaun, I-- You sure? All right. Well, I feel we're seeing your true talents. She is pretty nifty. Well, come on, come and have a drink. Holla! One at the bottom of the sea. You ever want to revisit home? He's a devil. And I think we can table Meowmix for a little bit. Somebody told us it takes a while. Not forever. And the Vestige there is the staff? He's a big picture man. Here's the detail fellow. Beret. You are a sexy dinosaur. Also, Gilmore, as a sidebar, what about that black ball beneath the city? Has anything been learned of it? That's what I thought. Walking is really good for the health though. By the skin of our teeth, Scanlan. By the skin of its gut. Seeker Asum is on it. He said that he was going to-- Are we talking though about how scrying is a little dangerous right now? Yes. We're working on that as a side venture. What are we going to do there to make that happen? You are really strong. That's the end of it, I have nothing else to say. Yes. Delegate. Gather all the papier-mâché you have in the city. Yes, we do. There were some baubles in a wall in Krieg's secret cave. Did we see that in the black? But it's not safe to assume-- Asum, sorry-- that they're not in communication. We have to assume that they are. I'm so sorry. What? You're gambling on jealousy. Dump a couple of statues. Percival, even just for intelligence, even if it was brief, even to see what is going on there. What do you think is the right move? That sounds like a plan. Let's go. Too many negatives now. They were fishing. Your nobility is showing, Percival. These white gloves are sullied. I need a new set of white gloves, please. Dream about a cloak, Percival. Maybe we can get you a cloak. You did say Vex, right? You said Vex. What is it? You want my sister to live in a mausoleum? Uh... I follow. I am having trouble. I've been really angry at you. I don't know if it's entirely fair, but I can't shake it. I don't know that I'm willing to let go of it yet. Percy. I've always liked you. From the beginning, I've always liked you. You are intelligent and charming. And good in a tight spot. I would like to be friends with you again. I just have a condition. My penchant for forgiveness with my sister's welfare is razor thin. If you can respect that, then we don't have a problem. I have some idea. I don't agree with that line of thinking. I will recommit to that same promise I made. I do like you. Well, then it's your lucky day. I'm on board. You have me. Whatever you will. I have something I need to take care of, which you know, and I hope you will help me with it. But I do not take your gift lightly. You have me. I close the door again and head back to town. 30. You're paralyzed from fear. Blood pudding. Part of the traditional Whitestone breakfast is-- I think you got that backwards? Vote. Aye. You could also do one to ten and 11 to 20. Can we get back to Umbrasyl's lair? I thought that was a good idea. If we stop at Umbrasyl's lair, is there anything we can do to run Grog out like a labrador? I'm worried about him not getting enough playtime in. No, in the mansion. Can you bamf up anything for him in the mansion? No. We're going to go camp somewhere for a day, right? Right now? I've been travelling with these fuckers for years, and I still don't understand magic. Lockheed. It's a coin flip. The Mending Wheel. A creature only? Oh shit. Fucking magic! Yes, does that stretch across the planes? That's it. He created this idea and he's backing out. He can play the fiddle very well. We are fucking idiots! I'm going to pop my wings out and hook my arms under Kiki's armpits. 35. Fly through, and then once I see them hit the ground, I'm going to dive-bomb us, and I'm going to wrap us in a little wing bubble and roll into the snow. I rolled a 15 and a 20. That would be a 30. I love this game. Stubbed your toe, big guy? Tibs. We're friends with Tibs. Tiberius. You remember us? He's a little small monster. Tiberius was teaching him Draconic. Where is home? Unless Tibs got further along with him, it was one word-- One word at a time. How far off? Yeah. We can at least pretend to cower and be afraid of lizard men if we see them. You know when you bang your balls on a rock or something? It's like that, you go, (groans). They didn't take kindly to him. Bronze? That's chromatic. Metallic! Bronze, silver, gold. Everybody else does fearful anime reacts the whole time. (gasping) Remember, like you've been hit in the balls. Don't have time! Umbrasyl was here. Acid. Nine. And they're not frozen over? But snow, not blasted with ice? I'm hobbling up behind. Drop it. Well, we're going to have a fight here. Does this make things better or worse for us? How's it going? Took about 1.5 seconds to fuck with Matt's name. That's totally different. We improvise. It's what we do. 29. We've been here, what, ten minutes? And the chromatic-- the red, the blue, the green-- are we seeing tails on them? It is our only purpose. We're good. I'm a vampire. Just deal with it. Ugh. I'm so tree-lagged, though. So the box is full of loot? The crate is full of boxes? When do you get to the loot, though? Box-box. I need boxes. Yes, with the dragon in them. My sister and I are going to have a look around. I have a question for you, though. If we make a stand here today, in theory, is it worth it to you to stand with us? All right. I'm going to start searching the ground for traps. 29. Looking for any traps. Is this the highest? The highest. 17. It's buried by ice. Some of them do. We spoke to them in Common. They'll stop playing nice. They'll start destroying. A poo, Scanlan. What?! What a sentence! What a sentence. One possibility is we could come back with Galdric, and he and I could play bait. He's a big fucking wolf. They'll know it was you. Spit it out. For now, we leave a back-door entrance. They're extorting us. To-may-to, to-mah-to. Look at Matt's face. Can I roll my initiative in advance? Where are we taking him? To our keep. It was very important to him. We'd take him away. Can you melt ice and snow, and we'll lay him here? I start pulling books out. I'm going to sit three or four feet away from him, facing him, and start privately thanking the Raven Queen for ushering him on. He meant well. I don't fuck anything up with words, and I open the door. I'm not going to fuck it up by saying anything. I open the door. Bar hop! Bar crawl!
