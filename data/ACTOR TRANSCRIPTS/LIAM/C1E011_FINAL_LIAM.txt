Scanlan's in traffic. He's stuck, he's really stuck. These are dried apricots. What's the landscape, topography, everything? That's true, were there-- You said there were buildings around? All right. Okay, stealthing away. No. 20. (retches) I should have rolled the one made out of meteorite, but I used the jade one. And it all went wrong. And I'm saying (retches). Good plan (vomiting noise). So helpful if he was here. I know he's got a great plan, on the 5. That is what he would want to do. Vax just backs back into the shadows, hoping the giant forgets about him. 27. Yeah, you guys are way far behind. I just run up the thing's back. I rolled 27 for that stealth, so presumably I'm-- -- disappeared-ed-ed-ed. Yeah. So I'd like to stab him in the back. Okay. I miss, horribly. A one and a two. No, not yet. It's too late. If you had been here five minutes earlier, you might have helped shape what happened. Appreciate it. Nice! Nice! You're at 39. Aw. 47. Checking the stats. I tried to backstab him so I'm right behind. He's gonna shit on me, isn't he? Hello, handsome. I'm going to use the meteorite. That's better. 17. Yes. (retches) Sorry. Yes. No, sorry. I'm up? You should come in close. Then I can fuck him up. Yeah, so it's the same right up against him or five feet back. Same same! If you move away, he's gonna take a swing. I'm not saying any of this, I'm just thinking it, furiously. (sings) You got the touch! You got the power! Okay. I'm going to use that. I want to make an acrobatics check. I want to jump up on this guy's knee, and then dagger-dagger right into his strange eye that he tried to mess with me. The eye, yeah, so I want to jump up his body, off his knee. So what do I do? Acrobatics check first? Okay, so four. I'm going to use Luck. 19 for the second, so that's 19 plus 13, so I'm pretty sure I succeed. Yes? Say that again. All right, meteorite die. No good. First one's no good, second dagger. That's good, and that's also good, identical, so that is a 26. Thank you, meteorite die. Okay, so this is 1d-- durdee durdeedoo? Okay, that's a two, plus six is eight. Oh, this is a Sneak Attack? Yeah. Hey, you're a nice guy. Eight, is 12. And is 17. And 18. And 22. And is 26. Eyeball. I will Disengage and move back, which means that he can't take a swing. I'm pretty sure I get that on top of that, as a Rogue hoo-hah. But I'll stay there if you want. I'm in no mood to argue with you tonight. Okay. Yeah, I'll move back. Sure. Yeah. That hits. Okay. Where he ate the Lembas bread? Everybody all together, now? Cleric and the sorcerer. 13. Five. He smells slightly better than he did before. Yes, you were tickling his nipples with your water. The gnomes are like tent spikes, holding him in place. Oh my god, is the beholder attacking? Is it now? Look how little you look, next to him. You're so small. Yeah. I'm going to go stealth. And then, this ring. This is a wall, right? So, going stealth, is that a bonus action? Okay. Well, I still want to do that. So I'm going to try to scurry over the wall there, and go stealth. Yeah, it's part of the cunning actions. All right. Okay, so roll to stealth, right? Come on, meteorite die. I'm using Luck, because that was terrible. That was still terrible! Okay, all right. I'm not stealthed, but I run over by-- Oh. Five and a-- Oh, sorry. It was so pitiful. 16 and-- It is for me. 16 and 18. All right, I want to roll over the side of the wall, and then just move along over by Scanlan. Between Scanlan and the giant, and just hold my attack. I can trigger that down the road, right? Okay. Then I'm going to stab him in the knee All right, I'll throw it in his face. All right, that's no good. And then the bonus action is also no good. Well, they're gone. Four and a five. Plus-- I didn't sleep at all last night. 12 and ten. Sweet. 19. When are you clever folk going to get in his head? Wow! (whispers) Rock him, Keyleth. Rock him. That's very temporary. While everybody's discussing, Vax is going to walk down to the center of the pit to take a peek at that hole. There's a pair of pants hanging off his eye. I'm going to see if I see anything more than just spikes down in the hole. 24. I have a plain old 50-foot rope. I'm going to try to tie it to something on the edge. (whispers) Percy! Could you give me a hand over here? (whispers) There's something down in this hole. Do you think you could hold on to this tightly while I climb down? All right. It worked on you. (whispers) Grog, there's a diamond up my butt. Vex'ahlia. Ask him what his name is. Yes. Tetanus, yeah. All right. That's a 25. Pull me up. Well, I can't use this. It's a javelin. It's beautiful. She doesn't really throw sharp, pointy things. This would be good for you, big guy. I'm still holding it. Tell me about it. I spin it, rotate it in my hand, handle towards Grog. Of spikes? Take the watch, like we normally do. I'll sit up with Percy. We need to find a frost giant, first. Well, we saw through Keyleth's Scrying. Somewhat. Care for some Cold Stone? We've had a lot of success flying around, right? What if, and I don't know who does what, but what if one small group flew in with Tiny in the form of a mouse. And then-- With instructions and drop him, and in mid-fall, a cursed giant lands at the front door. And if you're on the flying carpet dropping him, you get out of there. That's good too. But he could go apeshit on us. Half the team gets into position on the top of that thing. The other half splits off, drops the giant, the giant goes apeshit for like a minute. Right? Drawing help away from the beholder, drawing attention down there. We wait for a minute, then start pouring acid and Grog smashes it with his fucking forehead. LAURA AND Can we recap on your-- You looked in using your magics, and you saw-- Tell us what she told us. Kima. He means Kima It's not one large mind, right? So you are Randy Quaid. Are we 100% certain there's no nooks or crannies, or holes, or anything? We don't want to go have a look? You're assuming we know everything there is to know about this structure. About the city around it. Well, I don't know how to tell you the things that you don't know yet, because you don't know them. Take this guy. He can go invisible. We'll just take a peek. United as one! Scanlan, start tap dancing! Tune in for the beholder fight three weeks from today! He's being true to himself. Crisis averted. He's mending the cask. There's your woobie. You can sleep again. I was just about to say, does this look normal to you? You know, I've got a lot of flexibility back and it feels stronger, but it doesn't look quite right. I just want to be able to sneak better. This is like the fourth time we've done this. It's not nothing. Like a puppet show? Well, we're moving pretty fast. I say we go all around the rim of the city. Advantage, you said? I got a 14. What figures? MATT AND And just to clarify, the part where we saw all the illithid figures was on the opposite side, right? (voice breaks) So the-- (voice breaks) Yes. Well, I'm only 62. Yeah, the city is crawling with illithid. But more on the northern edge, not so much here on the side. And it's a lot. It's not a few, it's a lot. We need a distraction, though. That's the only thing I took away from what we saw. Yeah, but they're going to take you over, big guy. Here's what I think is better. We take Tiny, transform him into a mouse. We fly over, just when we're over the right part of the city, flick him in the mouse nuts, and toss him off. And then let him turn him back into Tiny, as he falls into a pile of illithid and keeps them busy. We need to draw as much attention away from the beholder as possible. The nut-flicking part? And he could turn the thing on us pretty easily, I'm willing to believe. We're all open to an idea to get him out. Have you got one? And also, I don't understand, we're talking about crashing the thing. But aren't we risking, at least, risking dropping the upside-down pyramid onto the Elder Brain? I still think we should drop Tiny on top of the-- or at least, near the main illithid encampment to keep them busy. K'Varn's eye will turn there for a moment. Yeah. Your plan is to lead the charge into K'Varn's lair. That's what you're saying. Do I have that correctly? (laughter) Let's go do the stupidest thing we've ever done. Who's throwing-- Who's throwing him? The way we always do it, don't we? Don't the gnomes fly-- Bird-style. Okay, so Percy, Vex, Vax on the flying carpet. No, we can't all fit. This is what we always do. You carry the gnomes-- How's he going to get from the top of the pyramid down in? Maybe he should hide here and live to tell our story. Scanlan and I flew over there. 36. I thought you stayed back. I saw it. Go home, bats! (laughter) He could be watching us, for all we know. Can I just say, I have no idea what's about to happen, but it's been a great pleasure to walk beside each and every one of you. No, we want him to be weight. (high-pitched) It's been an honor. This is the suck. Well, they're a question mark. I am going to try very hard not to die. I am clicking my Boots of Haste. 17. All right, I'm going to-- I'm hasted, I'm going to throw three daggers down at him from here. Okay. Okay, so for each attack, too. So where's my-- Okay, that misses-- Well, five. That's a 16? 21. Okay. And the last one, I'm just going to roll it now, is a 17. Okay. So the-- I'm hitting him with poison dagger. Yeah, advantage, well, advantage on attack rolls on enemies who haven't taken a turn yet. Any hit on-- is a crit. Any hit on a surprise is a crit. Yep, a poison dagger, which gets three-- is nine, plus poison with a DC of 15? Yes, he takes eight plus ten points of poison damage. On top of the dagger damage. Every roll counts. Yes? There's a d10. It's so quiet in here. Okay. 24. Fuck! What you've been waiting for, Clarota. 20 and a 15. Are there ropes still going down? Okay, I'm going to do something stupid. I'm going to grab the rope. I'm not going to rappel, I'm going to grab about-- How high are we up? 50 feet, all right. I'm going to use my bonus action to get down to 25 feet and I'm going to jump-- But I'm going to jump out in the hopes of swinging this way, and swinging back towards K'Varn. That's what I want to-- Pendulum at him, yeah. I want to jump out and go, woo, woo! Natural 20! (cheering) Straight towards him. Three knives, because I have friends right up against him, this is a Sneak Attack. Okay. Okay. Fine, that's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Okay, great. That's great. That's 17, plus-- That's a 28. Let's just go ahead and roll-- That's the to-hit. So let's just go ahead and roll damage now. So there's no plus-- I forget what's added for, like, my dexterity and what's the magic-- The keen-- Oh, it's two for the keen dagger, so one plus five is six. Now here comes the Sneak Attack damage. Six plus-- There's nine, 12, 13, 18, 22 for the first. Oh, and Natural 20 is a crit. Sorry, I'm vibrating right now. Okay, so the second attack is a 19 plus-- 29. So that is a measly four plus five is nine. And the last one we use jade, and I shouldn't use the jade 'cause that didn't hit, I don't think. 14? Okay. All right, I'm sitting on the beholder. Worth it. Okay. With advantage? 20. Yeah. I love you guys too much. Those zeroes look so good. (high-pitched) What about the poison? It was one-time. Disintegrate. You could've been dead. Badass. Natural 20. That's all you gotta do. All right, I'm going to run-- I'm still Hasted directly underneath the mind flayer. And throw the daggers up. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Yes, and here we go. Ten. First attack is a 21. All right, so, okay. So that one misses. Second one. That's a 15. Misses, right? And the second one, come on, man, is a 20. Okay. That's a dagger into its butt. Three. And there's no non-magical effect on me at the moment, right? 'Cause I'm out of his vision? So that's a nine? Just for damage? Okay. Come sit on me, dude. Come on down. It's able to-- I just don't know, I'm not challenging it. Even under-- On its tushie? Oh. I was going off that, okay. All right, so what am I making at the-- Advantage, 18. Like a hairnet? I didn't see the second one. 17? I've never looked so intensely at a little plastic toy. Full view of the eyeball, like, "Fuck you". Do you have a potion for a bonus action? Shove it in his mouth. With what? Move out of the way. Move out of the cone. Past Clarota. Maybe out-- You should lob a Fireball. Vax is up? I am? And Keyleth has already done her fastball special, that couldn't happen again at the moment? All right, so dagger-dagger-dagger. Okay. That's 26 to hit for the dagger? Hmm? Oh, sure sure. 26. I don't know if I'm in his cone or not. If I'm not in his cone then that's a ten of damage. The next is-- I'm going to use a Luck point, because I have one more. And I get 20-- Yes, 25. Okay. Which is ten of damage, and the last dagger is a one, so it just flies away. Evil god! Just two more hours. We got this. Sure. Sure, I'm not worried. Yes. Natural 20. Jump. (sings) With advantage! Still alive, still alive. 74. Potion? Potion potion potion potion. That's by your feet. Oh yeah. Yeah, so beat it in the face. Punch the eyeball. Zip, zap, zop. Three more forms to go. How many of you are going to have a hard day at work in the morning? That seems a little one-sided. (laughter) (Illidan voice) You are not preared! You stay up and watch livestream into the middle of the night. (laughter)
