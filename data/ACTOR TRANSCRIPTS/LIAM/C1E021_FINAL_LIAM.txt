I would like to announce that I am nervous as shit. No. I should feel comfortable that you're going to soak it all up. Come on, guys. Just like we did in rehearsals. (laughter) He's more into Shadowrun. We need to build bleachers back here. We've got this thing. Well, step into camera if you're going to make such a big to-do. Come in and say hi, and then get out. You already pulled Wil out of the picture. We never left. 13. Are they rats or are they ROUS's? Yeah, he does that. Math is for everybody, guys. Really. It feels like you just did 17 things. Now go home and get your shine box. We're how high up from here? We're that far back? All right, so it takes my whole movement just to run to the edge probably, yeah? And that's it? Bonus action, right? But I can't see. Can I see past the lip of the edge to the top of that? (sighs) That's it. Are you body-shaming that otyugh? Coming! Okay. I'm going to run up to the edge of it. Are any of my friends right up against this nasty shit? Keyleth. So if it's occupied with my friend, I can take a second, aim really well, and sneak attack from up here. Okay, so that is 24. All right, so sneak attack. That's a two plus nine. This is Keen Dagger. Nine. Plus 12, 17, 21. That's 21. 30. And the second dagger, which is Life-Stealing, hits with a 24. That is eight. Nope, just going to perch. That is CG. That is computer-generated. You got your dick bit by a rat, son. You're a man now. You need d10s. Refuse is code for shit. I'm staying safe up here. I'm going to throw more daggers. There's a little pile under Thorbir's hiney? And a little bit out by itself, right? Are they spilling out from under the dwarf's hiney? Or are they all hidden? Okay. I'm going to throw daggers at the one that's biting his ass, so it's a sneak attack. That's not good. That's 13. Oh hey, rats. Oh, right. That's two plus seven is nine, plus 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 21 is the first dagger, and I send the next one down. If the last one hit, this one hits. So that's 21 and the second dagger is a ten, so 31. Cheese! I'm going to hop down in the shit and loop an arm under Thorbir's arm. Come on, old man. All right. Hold on, everybody. I walk right toward it, perception checking the area around it and the door itself. That's 24. Locked. All right, well, I pull out my little sack and I pull out one of these (twing) and go to work on it. That is a 28. I Fonzie'd it. Okay, Tiberius, are you still lighting up this room? Okay, so there's probably a little bit of light going in there, so I'm trying to look in to see what I can see from his spill-in there. Okay. Tibs. Follow that. Try and keep behind me. And I throw up the hood and go as low to the ground as I can, and I start to Gollum along the floor, looking at the ground in front of me in the dim light, trying to see if I can see any traps ahead of me. 25. Hear anything? I grab my earring. Let's do it. And I start moving forward. I'm looking at the floor and everything as far out as I can see ahead of me. I thought we would have seen it here. What's in there? Okay. Out comes the pick. I'm going to perception check that corpse through the cell. That's a 12. Now for the door. Natural 20. I feel really terrible, but I'm going to give him the old half-elven pat-down and see if I can find anything on his personage. You can do that? That's badass! You know he's dead, right? Weeks ago. Not five minutes ago. Thorbir's right. We're burning time. We need to go in. You're absolutely right. We're going in. When we're in there, you keep it busy, and I will carve it up. I slide past Tiberius, crouch down to the ground again, and start scuttling along the ground. Looking, listening. I'd like to imagine that Thorbir and Vax left that conversation behind a little. I start pushing back on Thorbir, backing everybody up, silently pushing backward and trying to steer everyone in a heap backwards and to the side of the cell we just came from. Just trust me. 19. Did I get them into the cell? Yeah, that was what I wanted to do, just backwards to everybody. I give everybody a group hug with my Cloak of Elvenkind and try to make a big rag pile out of this corner. I'm very uncomfortably pressed against Thorbir's backside. (laughs) Thorbir. It's the thought that counts. (muffled) What the fuck? All right, back around the corner, following around, looking, listening. Everybody the same. Perception? I got you, baby. Well, that was perception. Towards that other door that they did not come out of. 23 I rolled, perception. Okay. Let's unlock it. That is a 21. Can I use Uncanny Dodge to roll backward right now? And I say, nope! 11, as well. I roll back, going (squeals). Okay. I will do that. 11. This is going to be fun. (whispering) They call me Count Chocula. (laughter) Use this one; it's quicker. Would it be his wisdom? 17. Right now, me and ghost in my mind are doing that scene from Ghost with the pottery. No, Tiberius-- ! I rolled 22. Rock that math, come on. Don't I make a stealth check? He got 19! Oh, yeah. That's true, yeah. My cloak gives you disadvantage. Okay. That is a nine plus five, ten, 22, 24. That's 33. There's no save or anything? Let's go to the bar. 17. It's hard to accept love from others when you hate yourself. Okay. That's shit. I rolled a 12. With advantage on both attacks or one? Because of my ghost friend. So the first is high. 28. Second is a one. Come on, one. (mutters) 19. Doesn't he have an armor class of 20? Doesn't one of them miss? Wouldn't a 19 miss his 20 armor? No, one was a total 19. So the first one does, and that is-- okay, that's the lowest this could possibly be. Seven plus nine, 12, 16, 17, 24. Tag. I don't like this game. I don't really like this episode. Come on, clock me, War and Peace. Let's do this. Okay. You have a fan. You told me, when I pick-pocketed that guy topside, it was a healing potion. It was blue, right? That's what you told me. I'm pulling that out of my pocket and walking over to that door in a daze and I just down it, push the door open with my foot. No. Well, yeah. Sort of. My name is Vax! And I keep going. I'm just looking. I take another potion, because I have one more. And I'm going to look down the hall. Save it. What's that? Superior is a 4d4? I'm just going to look down that hall. Okay. I put my hand on Thorbir's hand and guide him back out and shut the door and say, it's fucking acid in that room. I just sit on the ground. I'm back in the hall with you. Acid-filled room. I'm going to rest. Let's all just take a breather. Do you want to camp, or do you want to take a breather? It's a 20-foot-long hoagie. Too soon. (laughter) It's a tribal food that her people eat. It's vegetarian. She set it out. Have a seat. Eat the food. I just start eating. I'm wiped out. He's going to get gone. That guy or that gal. I don't want to go on a date with it. I want to kill it. We're on the clock, here. How long does everything last from that feast, Keyleth? I'm already good. Yeah. I flip my last potion to Keyleth. It's a superior. We don't have an egg timer. He just ran down here. He could fly to Timbuktu. Go to Kraghammer. Hang out with Johnny Kraghammer. Long story, Kash. Let's go. I'm going to slowly push that door open and try to use perception in the room. Yeah. If that crud is moving. And try to see a door on the far end. Wait a tic. Wait a sec. I back out slowly, and I'm going to creep back to the other door. That other one, yeah. Perception check there, as well. That's 16. Okay, and does that count for the traps, as well? Okay, so I'm going to open it an inch and see what I can see. Acid, it is. That's what I just looked in. Oh, a third door. I thought there was two. Just, allow me. You're strong. That's 27. My armor is resistant to acid. Let me lead the way. Is there any shit sitting around? Any rubbish? I'm going to pull up a plank of that crate. Everyone but me. Well, there's that. Do you maybe want to sparrow across, Keyleth? Then I get to come. You guys are pretty great. Oh, we all fit on it? Oh, look at that. Staring at the slime on the ground. Looks like Kash is. 26. Sometimes I really hate this old-world shit. Can I make out any traps or anything in the ceilings or the walls? But nothing in addition to that. How about handle animals, man? It's going to be all right. Tell me how I would go about doing this. As I fall with the carpet, I want to try to pull up on the carpet and land in the shit. 27. I'm wearing acid-resistant armor. Am I under? Is the carpet with me? Under the acid. Well, that did not work. Me? I'm trying to climb up onto the rock that is right there that I didn't jump onto. Who's on it now? Well, I guess I'm swimming through acid, then. No, I'm just going to start wading towards the other side. That's all right because I rolled a 19, so that is a total of 21. I saw this great documentary about it on YouTube. I can walk. I can fight. I'm not as pretty. Vex is going to kill us. My sister. On a delay, they just saw it. The other half of the party saw it die. 20 seconds after it happened, and we heard them scream from out there. Can we just take a moment for the carpet, please? We've had a lot of good times with that carpet. We found Clarota on that carpet. Never mind. Let's not talk about that. (sighs) Well, I do. And my sister's going to kill me, specifically. (groans) Sorry. Got an 18 on perception. So we're at a dead end on the other side of this shit? Look, Tiberius, it has sentimental value. We'll put it in Greyskull Keep. Just put it in the bag. Folks, we're moving! And I follow him. I'm going stealth now. I want him dead. I want his house burned to the ground. 22. I can fly! 19. To quote the bard. Scanlan. All right. Well, I earlier rolled a 32 on stealth, but I don't know if that means shit right now, but I'm clicking my Boots of Haste and moving along the wall. No. I'm going to stay put. I'm going to attack him. I'm going to throw-- dagger, dagger, dagger-- through the air. (flying blades) From the shadows. I have no idea. He might be able to see me like the Predator. He already moved, right? So I don't get advantage for Assassinate, but we'll see if I get sneak attack damage. That's a three, so that's shit. That's a nine-- 15. That is 21. That was the Dagger of Life-Stealing. Now you tell me I was hidden in the shadows and rolled a 32. Does that matter with him? Yeah! Okay. (counts quietly) 22. Yeah, 22. I'm going to move through the group, directly counter to him, behind the statue. I'm using Evasion. I'm going to hit the ground and roll. Well, what did we have to hit? I rolled a 16. So I made it? Nothing. I hit the ground and roll. Stop, drop, and roll, people! Stop, drop, and roll. Tiger on tiger?! Here we go. This is science. Even your memory betrays you, Wheaton. But with advantage. Ugh, 15. Yeah. (robotic) I will kill you all. I'm possessed, man. Besides, you should have done that shit already! The moment already happened. I'm possessed. You can't retcon that shit. Let's cut the guest visitor because really. Really? And I'm hasted. My boots are hasted. So here I go. Oh, that's good. That is a 23. Should I do damage on all of these? All right, but there's no sneak attack, so not that bad. Great. Good. I mean, let's kill this guy. I love you, rakshasa! Okay, so that first one hit for eight. The second one is a natural 20. (carving noises) You're already cut up. You don't even know. This is not sneak attack, so it's not the worst it could be. That was my life-stealing dagger, and on a natural 20, I get the ten hit points that I cut from him. Or whatever I get, I guess. It was seven, which is doubled to 14. Oh, okay. Oh, so that's much less, then. That is an eight. And then I get ten hit points. How does it work? It says I get ten hit points, so I just get ten, or do I get up to what I cut him for? Well, the good news is, I'm back up to full. Here comes that third dagger, man. This one is poisonous. And that hits. That is an eight, plus the poison has a DC of 15. Roll a 15 or higher, please, Will. Sorry! I'm so sorry! He's putting it on my face. I can't help it. I'm so guilty. With advantage. 19 or a five. So I'll take the 19. 21. Oh man. I feel so bad about this. Channel it to where it matters. No, I'm good. I'm out. She's becoming the Destroyer! It's called crisscross applesauce now. I'm going to use my bonus action to hide. 27. Two daggers out of the dark. I'll keep that. That is a 30. Can I squat down behind Kash? All right, you tell me. I don't know how bright or dark it is in here. Can I run, Naruto-style, low, now he's behind me, toward the statue and crouch at the base of it? And then shoot up from there? Okay. First roll was a 30. (counts quietly) 38, for the one dagger. Number two. Probably going to go astray. That was 14. Give him the Al Capone, Kash. I'm going to uncannily dodge. Once a round, I can halve the damage. Oh, yes. No. You can do four level-1 spells. You can do one level-4 spell. You can do two level-2 spells. Don't piss off Tetsuo, man. You were saying something about my sister? He suddenly turns pink and says, (Snagglepuss impression) exit stage right, even! (laughter) How far is he from that statue? 30 feet? Okay. He's not paying attention to me. Can I use my bonus action to go stealth? All right. With advantage. Come on, you fucking motherfucker. That is 28. And I'm throwing daggers at the back of his head. Yes. That is a 27. Do we call that sneak attack? 30. I've got the dagger in my hand, right? I see him flying away. I'm crouched down. I flip it over so the blade's in my hand. I don't go fast. I just take my time, pull back, throw it harder than I usually do, through its neck, out the front. I grab it by the ear and lift its head back. You talk about my sister again. And I boot it into the acid. Don't push my buttons, man. I never touched it. Oh, come on. Oh, the actual, physical-- Here it is, clearly, right here. We're fine here. Everything's fine. WIL, LIAM, and Come on, Mononoke. Gather around. Watch what I can do! (laughter) On the way out, I grab two glasses of ale, and I hand one to this guy and just walk and don't say shit. What a button on the night! (laughter) Dice aside, great character. Kash money! (laughter)
