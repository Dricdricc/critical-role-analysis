We all had to fought to be heard that time. I think Matt went dead inside. I guess somebody at this table used to go to furry conventions. It does not go well with fur. I have a bunch as well. And there's copies for us in this building somewhere. Yeah, that's it. Could be. Character development. The baby is sitting playing Dungeons & Dragons with us. LIAM and Send those suggestions to @laurabaileyVO on twitter.com! Well, we played the game once in that back office, so we could just move to you and then bring the stuff with us. Dwarven Forge, Dwarven Forge, Dwarven Forge. I liked that guy, though. He was good. He was talented. He was burned alive in front of me. I am well aware that I killed a person. I have nothing else to say, why is everyone looking at me? I'm okay. It was terribly grisly; his hair was on fire and he burned horribly. Maybe it went a little further than I anticipated-- I have killed people before in defense, ja. But not like that. Okay, that sounds good. Would you like to know what they are before you put them on? Look over here. You look like a nerd. Yeah? I don't have ability, I understand certain magics. If you want me to explain what those things are before you try them willy-nilly, yes, I can tell you-- May I see it? Yeah. You know, I'm just going to check D&D Beyond to see if I-- Yeah, I'm all tapped, but-- I will tell you something. I will tell you something I don't need to have this ring, I can tell you what it is. I do, but I need a pearl. I say to Fjord, I need a somewhat valuable pearl, then I can do it all day long. I can know what anything is, even though I am tired. Is that worth about a hundred gold pieces? Oh, yes, let me-- Can I borrow this? This is not instantaneous. Since I am so tired, it takes me a little bit longer. I wedge out one of my books and I set it on the ground. It's up to you. I haven't done this in a while and I'm excited to do it. But I could hold off a little. Okay, I take the book and I close it and then I put it back. No, I have both the ring and the one that Fjord gave me. So if it's good for you, you may have it. I'm more interested in executing skill. Before we even go into the building, I go over to Nott and adjust the hood a little bit further forward. The ears are in and make sure that the mask is secure. Have fun. Yeah, I'm okay. It was a rough night. I did. No, I did not see a vision. I saw a burning person. Let's go get a drink. I'm going to find a corner table in the ruckus. I will take the ring with the pearl, and I hold it right here. I pull out the other ring and I look at it and I begin to focus and study the different angles of it and hope that I have a pearl of enough value to make things happen. It's already out. You know when you play D&D, you don't narrate taking a pooper, but you can assume that the characters take a pooper every day. Some things just happen. Yes! Oh. This is good. You may have it. I don't get into water too much, as you could guess. This is good for walking yourself upon water. You take this, as promised. Yeah, but also why is there a dickbutt in my spellbook? I don't know. Maybe it was Nott pulling a prank on me. No, I don't need-- well, I do want one drink, but I don't need a ton of drinks. This is my thing, so what else did we get? I will take the wand. Thank you. I need another ten minutes. Fjord, would you get me a second whiskey? By the time you get back, maybe I will understand what this is. Ten minutes later. (sighs) It's fascinating. (laughter) Is she full of shit? What do I roll? Yeah. I got a 15. No it's for me, I gave you the ring. That's the deal. I promised it to you and now you have it. If I tell you, you will try to steal it from me. No, it's too dangerous. (laughter) Fine, do you want to know what it does? I will show you what it does. I point this stick at Jester. It is a charisma saving throw. Oh, it's just a stick. No. Told you. A low what? I promise you'll have these back because I cannot lift them. Would you put them on the table for me? Hold the ring and wait. They are a very strange one. If you are feeling gassy, they take away the cramps you feel. You have to wear them. It's extraneous, it's too much. It's overkill. These are shit. I slide them off the table-- I want to do it again. What do we have? Give me the thing. Okay. Yeah. Oh. No, this is great. It's very powerful. It is a fine weapon. Probably better than anything-- except maybe for your blade. Is anyone able to use a glaive? I can't do anything with it. Do you know what this is? It is a very good sale at a pawn shop. Well, it's very painful if it hits you. That's it. Most definitely it is magical, yes. Stronger than your average glaive, that's what I am saying, yeah. You know people in Zadash? Who's got the monster calves to carry this? There you go. Here. Oh my goodness, yeah. Like 45 minutes have gone by looking at all these things. He just puts it away. He puts the wand down in front of Jester. It just hurts people. Do you know how to use arcane artifacts? What? He's not gone. He's always with me and he will be back tomorrow. Yeah. It burns people like I burned that man. Would you like to trade your goggles for them? You have that very fancy sword you have. Does it mean that much to you? Would you like it? Okay. Here it is. I don't know. No. He's good. I don't move at the speed of your thought. I'm sorry that I kept it for myself. Enjoy. I will not take any of the spoils of anything we find anywhere. Enjoy. It does hurt people. You seem very angry at me right now. I'm slowly, ever so slowly beginning to like you, so please don't fuck it up. This is what people do. Is she still smiling? It's constitution though, isn't it? I said constitution to you. Okay. I'm sure I'll fail it. 15. I will also pay for a room for Nott and Caleb. Wait did you just, ja? Did you pay for everybody or for you? Danke. I'm going to go get my cat! I go up. Well, I first take out the silver thread and I cross it across the door and if there's any windows there, I do the same and allow for Nott to enter and leave. Then I draw patterns along the floor that spread up onto the table as well and back down onto the floor. I squat with my book since I am tapped and I begin to bring back my cat. An hour and ten minutes later, I don't know if they're asleep or not, I have this cat named Frumpkin and I wear him like a scarf. Come here, I promise-- I promise not to do that too often. I just scritch, for a long time. I'm sure that one's not important. I know. (singing) Fuck balls. Did you give me a pouch? When did you do that? Oh, what is in it? Let's see. One... Two... And then ten minutes later-- Did you say 113? Okay, so after counting it all, I separate it and I put some jerky down-- go, have it-- to Frumpkin, and I push 60 gold across the floor. Come here. I have a question the metal on the ring with the pearl in it, what is it made of? Can I tell? I cannot remember, but Caleb can because of Keen Mind. Brass is that part of the alchemy that I can do? Yeah, that is correct. Copper, silver, wood. I just can't remember if it is. Do we have a Player's Handbook? Brass is not on it, okay. Then I'm going to spend the last 30 minutes before bed trying to slowly wedge the pearl out of the ring. I don't want the ring. 15. Brass. I take what's left of the ring and I throw it across the room for Frumpkin to go chasing it across. Go chase that. (whispering) We are assholes. I would remember exactly. I don't, but I do. Hold because if he knows he has to tell me because I picked the right feat for it. A hundred a piece already. We are so excited over chump change to Vox Machina. We are The Mighty Nein. It's just a spelling that is tricky. Yeah 'Mighty' in Common is spelled M-I-- H-- --T-Y. Now we come to the next word. N-E-I-N. Nein, nein, nein. Oh this game. Sheet, did you say Sheet? Was is pillow or pillar? Leaky Tap Tavern? Give us a day. Watchmaster, I'm sorry it slipped my mind. Is there anywhere still open in town after all of the carnage that sells inks and paper? I'm sorry, but I'm looking for the highest quality ink. Do you know what I mean? Okay, thank you. Did you say her name was Shumas? This is the best campaign ever! I'm so sorry, Mr. DeAngelo, my high school German teacher! We're going forward. What was their name? Okay, mine was Jim DeAngelo. He's the principal now. I'm sure he's very proud of me. Thank you. What does that mean? Hmm-hmm-hmm. It sounds better in the original Infernal. (laughter) I'm picturing a public access infomercial. Then where were you at this point? Did you get to go to the park, did she read you stories, did she do the things that parents do? I am sorry, you are from the south, yeah? I am from the north. Does this include also, besides the hmm-hmm-hmm, singing and poetry, you said? So she was skilled as an artisan as well. That's fascinating, for real. How did you-- never mind. Was it nighttime or daytime? Funny is funny. He should have a better sense of humor. Your father is your father, how could you not be curious about your father? But it is still your right to know your parents. Who they are, you have to understand where you came from. What are you talking about, the bouncer? Okay. We have to go. We want to find a bigger city to disappear into. Ja. No. No. You know I think maybe you are confusing my good friend and I. You know, she's very little, and I am taller. So, it does have that sort of father-daughter look, but you know well, that's not exactly what it is. Yeah. You know if anything-- I've never really said this out loud before, but if anything you're more like a Schwester, a little sister to me. What is today? What is today in this world, DM? Yes. Well I will tell you, we'll get to that, but I think today we call your birthday. Yeah, you know, we never talked about that. I didn't realize that, so today is your Geburtstag, today is your birthday. He doesn't know. He will tell us later. Every year on a Thursday it is your birthday. Happy birthday. Congratulations, today you are a mighty nine. The pumpkin lattes have come out... Well I didn't do anything, you got me a pile of gold, so thank you. Come on in! Come on broken McGee. You've got to Lethal Weapon that shit. Oh shit, look at that. Stop! No, why would we be ambitious like that? We're not in a hurry. Ferris Bueller, all the time. I'm sorry. Don't laugh. If you are going to do that, we all need to stand 50 feet back. Because it's not a little (fut fut). It's a big one. I have a (fut fut). (fire burning) I am. Yeah, okay. Ten. It's gotten lower and lower. The shitty manacles? Yeah, excellent. That is a glaive. Oh, that's right! You also picked up a sledgehammer, yeah. Sledge! It worked. Never mind. I do that every night. It's just a given. A gif-in. Yes, DM, I would like to say that, too. If we're ever camping outside, just because Liam is a dumb fuck and will forget it. Every night, Caleb does silver thread around the group. Okay. That's around us, yeah. (singing) It's murder time in the campaign. Nein, nein! Up. Up! I would like to cast Friends on that gentleman. Ah, that's very low. That is a five. Somatic and material. All I did was just do this with my thumb and I put a little bit of rouge on my cheek. You'll have to be careful. We are going for help. Medical help. We all have syphilis. Extreme syphilis. Is this with advantage, right? That's the effect of the spell. Yeah. Oh yeah. That is a 22. 22. We are riddled with it. Oh, it's so much worse! Pity on us, please. We are just trying to get medical help. What was that? No, we might have tried a few things with that head, but, you know, we've paid the price. Clearly we have suffered enough! I mean, the amount of contact we have had, there is no question. You have to go. (dying noises) It's not as good. On this, for with my Friends? Is it the same guy? It's better. It's 13. Scorching Rays on that guy! Yeah, mm-hmm. Say again? On the guy I put Friends on, yeah. Yeah, that's an 18 to hit. Okay. Oh, the first one, right! It's three. Yeah, I forget. Sorry, it's a brand new spell. Second one is a 24. And the third one is a natural 20. Okay. The first is a 11, 12, 13, damn it. Ja. (Gasps) 37. Total. Yeah. It was three things of flame go shooting-- Because I did this. (fire noises) Oh, they're attacking me? They all hit. All three hit. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. As the flames go out, these come in. I have 19 hit points. (groans and coughs) Syphilis. I just failed my first death save. About six seconds went by. 11, oh, wow. Thank you. As he says that, I already begin picking through the remains of the leader's shit, looking to see if anything is left. Kiss yourself, Matthew. It's in Zemnian. Partially. (groans in pain) Two-- (groans in pain) Oh, cover my nips. I think I'm going to faint right now. Take them out! Take them out! (heavy panting) Oh, you're all awake. Why would you say that? I don't wear glasses. I've been asleep face-down in the cart, it feels like. Where are we? Did we make it to Zadash? Okay, let's fight these fuckers. Where are they? It's a 12. At our closest, where do we get to it before passing it? Is everybody sleeping? Okay. Am I controlling the cart at this point if everybody is sleeping? We're all just going, and I'm keeping watch? Wait, wait. I want to-- I just have to take a piss, hold on. I'm going to walk over towards the graves. I would like to get about 30 or 40 feet within range of it and start taking a tinkle. After I shake it and put it away, I move my fingers in a shape in the air and whisper a few arcane words and cast Detect Magic within range of the gravestones. Okay. I squeeze out a single fart and go back to the cart. What is that? Can I see that? Yeah, I would like to. Do I recognize this? Yeah. Yeah. That is a 14. Julous Dominion. Two centuries. Caleb says You know, it's funny-- and then says everything that you just did to everyone in the group. Here's your helmet back. Steeped in history. The further out you are, the easier it is to bend the rules. They have the best of the best in the north, ja. What and culture? LIAM and What are you talking about? I hear. Frumpkin is fucking miserable because he's drenched and he does not like to be wet. Sorry, Caleb trips, or pretends to, into the mud, and scoops up two fistfuls of mud and shoves them into his pockets. Is it still raining? Agreed, that is our first stop. We are looking for Claudia Sheed. I remember exactly, and Matthew will tell me because of my Keen Mind feat. It was entirely on purpose. I took the Clippy feat. Looks like you can't remember the details the DM told you. Would you like to ask him again and get an exact replication? What is a watch? What is a watch? You mean, like a guard? You are adorably, fucking wrong right now. Okay. To say "yes," it is "ja." That is your first lesson. Everything else you said was shit. Staggeras or Standeras? MARISHA, LAURA, MATT, and Ulysses Standeras. Strong name, ja, ja, ja. Ulysses Standeras. Mama Bear takes care of the Mighty Nein! You say that because it's a good idea, or because you're feeling--? Insight check! (laughter) 18. What, what? I cast Friends on him. Yes. Freunde. And I say. My Freunde-- I have just cast a spell on you, okay? So you just have to listen to what I'm saying, okay? I think you are kind of an asshole but so are we, we are the Mighty Nein and we will fuck you so hard if you fuck with us. 20. Ja, we're a bunch of Arschlochs, yeah, we're assholes it's fine, but I'm just saying-- Today we do. Okay, you see this one? The purple one? He will cut you from navel to nuts, so please, have fun with us, but don't you fuck us. Like a people mover. This guy is good. Ja. Penta-what now? Pentamarket. Would the Pentamarket also have the finest inks und parchment? Tri-Spies? What about of arcane quality? Also, I am a collector of rare tomes. I have a great appreciation for literature. Where might I find the most-- --elaborate writings in the city? The Archive? Could you give me a little more background? That is a very common word. That is excellent. Also, I'm a big reader. Is there any place that has pulp fiction and shitty smut? Insight check. That is 23. My friend-- I take him by the hands and say, You have given us a great welcome into this city. So eager to learn all about it. I take my hands away, and he has two gold in his hand. Just know, I'm a big reader. It worked! Caleb heard that. We've heard good things. Is it easy to work around the Empire here? I mean, no, he's not trustworthy, but we are birds of a feather. Yes, he was predictably a shit, just as we are. Yes, yes. I won't be long. Excuse me. And I just push in. I'm sorry. Yes. I've not been in this big a city in a while. Yeah. 20. Yeah, firbolgs. DM. Sorry. Before I engage in this. You say I've never encountered these, but I've read a lot. I know of them. This is my first encounter. Hello. Wow. Look at those horns. I'm so sorry. You know, I have never-- Forget it. I am looking for-- I have been in the woods for so long, I'm so happy to be in a metropolis again. I need ink. I'm tilting. I'm arching my face. I don't see. I have no idea. Okay, this is a little off-putting. First question that I have for you, Pumats. Pumat Sol, is there one of you and this is fun and games or you are--? Understood. Well, I only came here for business, so-- I am finding it very hard to concentrate at the moment, but I know that I need paper and the most expensive ink you have. You know-- I am not seducing this person. Touché! I need your most fine arcane ink and I also need your finest paper. I need about 150 gold worth of materials. Is that too much to ask? No. I pull two scrolls out of my pack. I have these. I found them in my journeys and I want to make them a part of my repertoire. Matt, I love you so much. (laughter) Meanwhile, I take every gold piece I have in a little sack, plus 20 silver, which is exactly 150, and I am out of money. Insight check. That is a 17. I looked at the paper, motherfucker. Yeah, I have to make a new character, guys, I'm sorry. I think that he's just dealing with used items. You could work him for a little bit, not a lot. A short case of-- A cheat code, if you will. Come on, La. Jester. Shits and giggles or utility, is the question here. You have enough gold to cover it? Also, where in the year are we in relation to Winter's Crest? Okay. Good. (Napoleon Dynamite voice) Jester, give me your tarts! Red velvet. It's good. What time of day is it as we arrive at the Leaky Tap? Where did those cow men come from, Matt? Where does firbolg come from? (Pumat Sol voice) Just been writing campaign lore for too long. Swamp Khary Payton with CR love. Swamp him.
