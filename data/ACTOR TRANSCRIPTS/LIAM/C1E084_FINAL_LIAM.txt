Victory! You have to get a plane back to New York now, right? What do you mean? I'm just an assistant. Wait, wait, wait-- I just take her wrist. It's no small thing to have a father who loves you. And I cast Lay on Hands and clear her mind of the alcohol. The more things change... (all laugh) Hey everybody. Scanlan's still in the game. (all cheer) There's a lot in there. In the meantime I wander over to Kerrek, just for a minute, and I say Kerr, I'm really terrible about lending my stuff. I forget who I've given what, and sometimes it doesn't come back. (all laugh) Thank you, thank you. Oh, that is beautiful. Right back where it belongs. That's me. It's just bass. I'm not even here, and I'll drink to that one. Fucking A. Now's your chance to throw something in the acid. (All laugh.) Riegel's not even here. You could run roughshod over that motherfucker. This is Liam talking to Taliesin. Thanks for clarifying. Wow. He's like a gnome Steve Buscemi. (laughing continues) With a quill? (laughing) it's a lot of letters Yeah, sharpies don't exist. Yes, yes. So very Vox Machina. He's on a different layer. A whole new sound effect. We've been playing this game three years. You wait three years to pull out that brand new sound effect of a cork (popping sound) coming out of a bottle. Wow, wow. Yeah, we started back in nineteen aught five, right? TRAVIS and (clicks tongue) Uh, I'm actually not here. I never left the temple. Ah, yes I did. And we'll have a flashback now. Super quick! Super quick. LAURA and Fucking exhausted. Set down everything that I own on the altar, and took ten minutes to take off all the armor and lay that out on the altar and just, uh-- Get your candies unwrapped, grandmas. (laughs) And I just stare at it. For a long time wondering, What happens now? That's it. And then I stay there for the whole night. ("flashback" whooshing sounds) Don't come in here, Trinket, I'm naked! I stand up and let my dinglies dangle. Yeah? Yeah. I give her a naked hug from behind. (laughs) Oh, we used to take baths together. (all laugh) Ah, he is, he is. And I back off. He's good. You missed quite a performance, actually. The younger Shorthalt. Oh, yes. I start to put on my sort of Mormon unibody underwear thing. Uh. So that's done, then. Dragons! Uh... Yeah, I've covered. The glory. (both laugh) Yeah. You encouraged me to embrace all this when I was complaining about-- (laughs) I'm happy. Ish. What happens now? (laughs) You're staying here? A husk. Yeah. Here? I know. I like it! I slept in it. (both laugh) No, I was thinking... I mean, I don't know what any of us are doing, but I was thinking that I might go back with Keyleth. For a while. I mean, you're set, you're-- This is your home, now I don't mean the place, or the building... You know what I mean. Sure. Sure. I would never turn you away. But I think that you have activities to explore here... But no, I mean, you're my heart, you're me, you're my other half, you're welcome with me always. I am happy. Happiest I've been in a long time. Long time. Yeah! Well, you know, I'm in my undies, so... Why don't you go and I'll catch up-- That takes like 22 minutes, though! All right. Yeah Yeah. No. Pike, how's he looking? Did he break a leg or something? All right. (whispers) I feel like we're missing something. Yes, of all of this and that? The Doinka Doink? Of all this and that. Of the Vermont de Boinks? Hey, make sure your people know. That man played the final note in the song of the Conclave of Dragons. That's right. Oh man, mutual, mutual. Three weeks from now, the door opens. (explosion sound) --specifically thinking, let me give Matt a little break here. I'll give him a little time. And then (makes loud sound). (mobster voice) It would be a shame if something should happen to your piece of mind before a D&D game. (dying noise) We just ended a threat to civilization. I don't feel like diving into the Nine Hells, at the moment. He's got to find some drugs, too. I'm just going to throw this out if we leave things as they are, The Clasp are going to completely ruin the city. At some point soon, we might want to get some of the Council back here faster. That's one, yeah. Whitestone. And you think you've got a handle on getting a foothold here? Hey, you know those boots you hate wearing? Oh, shit. (all laugh) Yeah. You look like a badass gladiator in Yuletide socks. He's like the chihuahua with the bulging eyes! Oh my gosh. It was like he polymorphed into something! We can start to look for new hands yeah. Can I have snuck down and be watching this? That's pretty high, that is a 30. Thanks. Oh! Hey! There you are. What were you doing in there? In the dark room with nobody in it? He ran out? That's who that was. I did. He's fast. (all laugh) You know, I just was looking for you. Yeah. yeah. Ah, I just wanted to thank you for working your magic yesterday again. Yeah. You saved him. You saved him. You did good, Grog. I'm proud of you. And, don't hurt me, I love you. Thank you. I slap him as hard as I can. And I use Disengage and I fucking run like balls! (all laugh) Not if we can help it. (laughs) It's like an eight-year-old with chocolate across his face (all laugh) I mean, the crucible is there. Could you shake it like a yuletide present? No. So fine. What's on your mind? Are we saying there's no one in the world who's truthful? At all? Well, the bottom line is, he's probably never gonna know if we take a peek. I'm not gonna open it, can I look at it? Can I look for locks or traps? I'm not opening it. Yeah? Oooh. That is a 22. And I don't know if it's locked. Ooh. That's even better, that's a 30. Four locks? Pickle, I will help you if you want, but my gut is telling me that this is just his wife's ashes. 30 again! Yeah, yeah, I think he's telling us the truth. Yeah. I'm gonna use my paladin powers. There's nothing undead in there, is there? Divine Sense, yeah. Yeah, man, this is just the guy's wife. You're so hardened by the war. Pickle, Pickle, Pickle-- Pickle, Pickle. There is a fucking tiger-faced demon who wants both you and I dead. We have bigger problems than this man's wife's ashes. But you carry it. We'll do a whole thing, we'll bury the ashes-- Vex just draws on that box. Sick! Like what? You want to go find an arcane shop-- -- find a very expensive container... We saved the world, but we are still a bunch of assholes. That is not a random tree. No. Yes, yes. Eight. They were both dogshit. Is it in the exact center of this big area of the trees? Oh, all right. But I mean, is it deep in or is it just as we come in? Do I get a vibe off of it, like it's a place where others have been buried before? I'll use Luck. Sure. All right. It was a tiny bit. Eight. What does it say? But there is a gift shop! Yes. A couple of months, actually. There are flowers here, aren't there? Lead the way, please. Whatever is closest. Thank you. As we walked over here, I turned around to the group and went-- (all laugh) Â This looks perfect. Pike, this feels right. Yes, it does. Pike, would you bring the box over here, please? Would you pray with me, please? Spike the box! Ours are cool though. Ours are-- Ours are besties. Yeah. Makes sense on the surface-- I know that we're all really fucking worn out, but I would like to not cheapen this moment any more than we maybe already have. Um, I am smirking, but trying to pray to the Raven Queen. That's cool. He just did that. Let's get her out of here before they change their mind, alright? Yeah. You know, this might be a bit of a wild hare, but watching you back there, I had a thought. Grog. I mean, we've just had a really hard time for weeks, months. It was fuckin' awful. You seem a bit punchy. You wanna take her-- -- to the Crucible? To let off a little bit of steam? Think she was off. We know you are an angel, but we know that you also have a little bit of piss and vinegar in you. They got gnome fights there? Tangentially, not today, not for a while. I need to go back to-- Yeah, not today. Eventually. No, I don't want to today. (softly) I'll come back. Oh, man. The Oubliette? Does that exist somewhere in this city, the Oubliette? It it likely that we have-- Right. Oh, out of character, Ashley, I wish you were here next week. We're gonna get into a fuckin' fist fight! Down in the Crucible! Round two. Fight! Don't pick me again. Me. Vix. Yeah, yeah. We love you! Foster!
