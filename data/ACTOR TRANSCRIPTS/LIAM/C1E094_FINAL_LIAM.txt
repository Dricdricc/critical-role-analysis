Mosquito. We've seen the fanart. We know. Die. Just die. You're out. Wow. You didn't go like-- She strictly plays Shadowrun. (laughter) Have you seen this boy? This is a sight better than the Nine Hells. Slow, slow, don't scare the boy. If you hum to him, it soothes him. Guys, guys. We have fuck-all to do right now. We have nothing to do. What do you want to do? It's actually quite painful and the hurt never goes away. That's right. And also, don't need to party or anything, but three cheers to you. You just survived hell and back. Yes. Percy, pass the bottle. This is out of character. Yes, we should. Yes, we should. It was a funny moment in time when you met us, Taryon. We had a bit of a list, we've had a couple lists, and we've checked an awful lot off of them, and we're real tired. We're thinking of taking it easy for a bit. Tinker, design-- It's true. Also, we feel very badly about Doty, obviously, and I hope that you can build a replacement, but in all the years that you were with him, did you ever have a sweetheart or an acquaintance, even? I mean, if you can push yourself to go to the Nine Hells, you can go out to a tavern with us and meet people. Do you-- this is forward, do you go rogue or ranger, or-- Taco or hot dog, or-- We've got to teach you some slang, buddy. You've got to learn some slang. Maybe we could get to that tomorrow. Can I insight him to see if this is bullshit, or legitimate tears? I'm outta Luck, too. Hold on, hold on. Oh, it's terrible. Five! But then tell the number. Where's my money, Taryon? Wait, wait, wait, Vex or Vax? I was also curious if the tears felt like crocodile tears, or-- Yeah. Yeah, were you really, like-- Right, so it's bullshit. Absolutely, but in this moment, a little bullshitty. We can talk about this tomorrow. Let's just go get him drunk, he'll probably tell you if he's drunk. I'm sorry, you're right in front of me. Let's go have a drink! Do your kids-- holding up okay? Cool mom. Had a little too much of Percy's hooch? What's the matter? She's back, baby! She's back! It was awful. You would not have liked it. You go to a casino in Marquet, you gamble. You go to hell-- He's just set in his ways. Show us the guns. Yeah. Yes, what's his or her name? If you tell us-- Well, let's put your best foot forward. What should we be looking for? Yes. Let's just talk aesthetics, because once you get into it, then you get to know the person. This person, what does this person look like? Does this person-- That is a lot of man. There it is. Man, though, I want to be at Ren Faire right now. Tell us more, holy hooligan, tell us more. Who she likes better. Who she likes better, and Pickle's the judge, that's easy to do. Tary-Town, be careful. You broke yourself! Oh, I said it's perfect for us. Hey! You don't even need to ask that again, the whole night. This is legit the twins over here. I mean we decided to-- Who she likes better, but that's open. What, assholes? TPK. TPK. 28. You don't necessarily want to tell them things. You want to talk to them and learn about them. What is that mother's name? (laughter) I rest my head on Keyleth's shoulder and say, I almost wish we were back in the City of Dis right now. Woof. No, it was terrible. Everything looked the same. It was dark, it was gray, it was full of fucking nightmares. I take it back, we did meet one really cool person. Werebear. Oh, I was being facetious. MARISHA AND I just meant that performance was a little tense, Tary. But a better towards the end. Surviving hell, talking to women. We've never met anybody like Doty before. That is some of the best advice I've ever heard leave your mouth. This is part of the initiation process, Tary. We all went through this. Tell us everything. What was her name? That's adorable. And you confronted your father? Did you try to find out what happened to Lawrence? Has anything you've gone through with us been like the books you've read? Everything you've read about romance, well, that's horseshit. Since we're friends now, and you're learning about us, what does your father do that you suspect he killed this poor man? He's a land baron? Do you like your father? Do you like your father? We've already put you through the ringer, darling. You're fine. Miserable. I think if we're going to bring up how you shat on money when we first met you and talked about how it was pointless and didn't bring you happiness. She's so evil. Yeah, I do, too. Mayonnaise, at the very least. (groaning, laughter) Don't quote fairytales anymore. I hope he likes it. I mean, he's-- Grog. He's dopey but he means well. He's all right. Okay. We don't want him to die outright. Luscious hair. Is Tary okay? What are you thinking, man? He crossed the threshold? Is that what you saw? What did you see? Well, Percival, you threw "gentleman" out the window about 30 seconds ago. All right. You've got to say hi to your sister. I can sleep anywhere, but why aren't we going to sleep in the nice beds in the castle? We'll leave a message here. He's a smart boy. That is so many glasses that she's far in. That's fair, you probably have some catching up to do. Back to the castle, yeah. I want to jump us back two minutes, and I'm not as sober as Percival, and we're arm-in-arm walking. Man, I'm so fucking happy right now, I'm so fucking happy. We have nothing to do. We have nothing to do! Well he's a clever boy, that one. Listen to me. I don't have any kind of timetable on it-- and I take her cheeks and I go (burbling noise) I'm so drunk right now. I can't wait to go home with you. I can't wait. I dunno when we're going to do it. Your home! Your home. I mean, Zephra. Zephra. I want to go to Zephra. I want to get to know your father! He's nice! He's so much nicer than my father ever was! Tiddly diddly dee! (laughter) Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Focus in on me, because I have something important to tell you, but I know that we're both very intoxicated. Okay. Listen. Yes, but, Kiki, listen to me. The Raven Queen is not done with me or with us. You know, when she picked me up again, when you-- When you brought me back, when Vex brought me back, when Grog brought me back-- She went (poof). Yeah. Then she went away, but then she didn't go away. She was still there. She's not done. So fucking drunk. But I don't want to think about that. That's later. That's coming, I guess. That's later. But I want to-- What? Yeah, that's a pretty big matzoh ball, that one. I'm going to change the subject though one more time and then we've got to go to bed soon because I am fucked up. I'm in the short term more confused and worried about my sister. Because there's no question that I'm going to follow you where you go right now, but I don't know what she wants to do. And I love her so much! She's my best friend! She's the coolest! So I don't know how that conversation's going to go, but, you know, it's going to happen. Stubby! Let's go to bed. Those two? They've got it all figured out! Come here. At the door, press foreheads together and I go, I'm going to pretend like I'm not drunk. Okay. I love you so much. Time to go to bed. (Capone voice) I want him dead. I want his family dead. I want his house burned to the ground! Mercy! Not the chapter of the story we were expecting. (laughter) My face feels like it's on fire. You can do that. I think you will be fine. Yeah, this is great. The things you have done-- Exactly. Heathen. If you feed it though, she becomes unbearable. Just temper that a little bit. What if one of the gods cannot see you underground? I think he can see you underground. Yep. Nope. It's all right, it's all right. Middle of the road. (Winnie the Pooh voice) Oh, bother. You did that. Girl! Come on, girl! Not quite. Get it, girl. You're the best! You are rolling dogshit tonight. Come on, Laura Bailey. Laura! Oh, double 14s. Ceiling! Go again. One and a two! That's great, because you're badass. Turducken. That's where we just were. Possible. Grody things. She doesn't have to do that. She can just ignore cover. You've got this. (sings) Matt owns tiny trees! Thorns. Laura Bailey one-on-one Dungeons and Dragons fight! That is just under average. Up. Go up. Your Hunter's Mark is in there already? I'm sure the thing is on the verge of death. Oh, son of a Gern! (sings) My sister in the woods-- You're okay. Natural 20. Roll now. Do it right now. That's not a 20. Character development! You gotta potion? Fucking down a potion, man! Do it! Triple the dice. It's really quadruple. You got your broom still, or is the broom-- Action plus movement, you can double movement away, up in the air. Away from this motherfucker. How high can you go? You have destroyed dragons, tree men, hearts... You have Uncanny Dodge yet? Yeah, she's alive. This is it, this is it, do or die. Hit 'em with the feather end? And you handed his ass to him? Just keep going. I'm going to take my sister to bed. A little woozy, but she did her thing. We are children! Yeah, let's get you into bed, yeah? Get some sleep. A top hat? Yeah, I can picture it. I'm opening the door to her room and leading her in. Maybe not ever again, that's what it sounded like. Could be years. Come on, let's get you undone. I start undoing the braid. Come on, in bed, in bed, in bed. Don't fall asleep yet, though. Are you? If you-- Fuck, I love you. So you did it, you did the thing. Yeah. You've carved out a little spot for yourself here, for now. This is the second half of that conversation. We have nothing left to do in the short term. And you love Percival. And Percival loves you. No duh, no duh. And I love Keyleth. And Kiki loves me. I don't know. I don't want to set a time on it, but-- You are going to stay here for a while. Yes, and you're welcome to come with me, but I don't think you want to go. You know, I had hoped we'd have the Gate Stone for this moment, but-- No, no, no, no! No, no, don't jump ahead of yourself. I just meant, we have work to do. I'm going to go to Zephra, and you're going to be nobility? That's funny. Just a little bit. But you wear it really well. Really well. You're classier than I am. Yeah. I'm going to go, you're going to stay here. But now we have some homework to do. Gods. Yeah. Keyleth can get us anywhere when we need. Yeah, but you and I need to-- Well, we need to enjoy ourselves, you need to enjoy yourself, but we also need to meet up and do a little research, because-- Calm down, you made the offer, not me. So am I. But we need to spend a little-- We're making plans for it because she is not done. You don't know. She spoke to me, Vex. Vex'ahlia. And we're all, all of them are tied up in this, and we need to have some idea of what we're doing, because whatever just happened is just a test run in her eyes. Yeah. No, no, it could be a decade from now. Yes. Both of those things. I want to enjoy myself, but just in case it's sooner rather than later, you and I need to do a little bit of homework, which you were very good at in school. I'm going to Zephra. Eventually. Eventually. Because it hurts, because I love you, because you are-- Stop, stop laughing for a minute. You are my best friend. You are my twinnie. And only you know what that means. Hm? You're always here. I don't know how to do anything without you! I'm very proud of you. Okay. Do you need to yak before you go? That sounds bad! Good night, good night. See you in the morning. (whispers) You're going to have a very good morning. Good night. You don't know! Not going to lie, I'm a rules lawyer. Bit of a rules lawyer. So memorize your fucking Player's Handbooks, you amateurs!
