Is that your woobie? Have you written any? Here's Percival's. You're human? You can have these. It's a happy little spot on the sea of the insanity that is the internet. Could somebody draw a picture of Scanlan and Lyra talking about the birds and the bees? That's a request I have. Please. We're a big fan of what you do. Zum Geburtstag, ja. That's German for happy birthday, darling.
