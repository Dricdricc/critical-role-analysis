Yeah I just wanted to, I talked about this last week. I'll probably talk about it next week, but I wanted to encourage you guys if you haven't already to go over to Joe Madureira's Kickstarter for their Battle Chasers game, Battle Chasers Nightwar. Joe's a friend of mine; he's a comic book legend, and is also a game developer and artist, and I'm just a big fan, and so they're a friend of the show, a lot of us here are in love with Joe-- physically, not his art, just him himself. He's a handsome man. And they, they, hit their goal almost immediately. They're just now making the game that is going to be shinier because they're climbing higher. But just go take a look, his art style is unmatched, and the game is based, is an RPG based in the JRPGs of our youth, and it's going to be great. Go take a look. Hey, the gnome is at the door. Can someone let the gnome in? Oh, fetching the gnome! You have to measure that out in a regular cup first, and then pour it in. Question, mine are on me, right? You just increased my chances by 2%. Thank you. That did not lead to further hallway, in fact that just led to a bedroom. It ended right there. They're kind of hot. Let's play, Matt. Let's play. That's 18. I'm frozen! That is a 21. What do you need? Deception check. Okay, I'm using Luck to go again. Yeah, I used one. I did a lot last game, but we were over multiple days. I used one this day. I'm about to use my second. (gagging noise) Okay, this is deception? Ooh, that's not as great. That's a 15. Thank you so much. Thank you so much! What can I do to help? I'm pretty meager a servant, but anything you need, whatever you need! Gosh, you guys are good-looking. (laughter) Well, my mom and dad said I'm a real good speaker. They paid for a tutor? To teach me how to talk. And it's worked out really well for me in my life. So if you need an ambassador, or a butler who talks? I could do that for you. Well, here's the thing you need to know about Uriel. And I take a step back. No! Away. Well, does he hold me if I turn? Well, I just said that, right? Here's the thing about Uriel. Oh, you don't want to know? Okay, I'll just save that for later. Roll for what, Matt? Oh, I'm going to use my last Luck of the day! Last Luck of the day. Okay, this is persuasion? That's 17. You could give me a-- never mind. Huh? No. Yeah, no, that's why I said never mind. Can I roll for initiative? Yes. My initiative can only be described as fecal. Wasn't a one. Six, it was six. It comes close. Should I check my iPhone, too? 19. That hits. He's holding me, right? Okay. As a bonus action I'm going to use rogue's cunning action to disengage, which means nobody can swipe at me if I run, okay. There's a window. Last week, you said there was a window to the courtyard. Okay. I'm running straight at the window, and as I run-- yeah, past them, and I don't go anywhere near her, and I'm using dash, and I'm leaping out the window and saying, jenga. That is a 32. Do I even stop running? I don't know. Am I able to talk further? That's a 13. (muffled) Fucking bitch! My name is Vax. I failed it. Nine. The universe is random and doesn't care about you and me. I'm unconscious. I haven't been knocked out in ages. Right, so it's only if it exceeds my hit point maximum that I'm killed outright, so I'm unconscious. Hey, guys. I'm unconscious. Wait. As that happens, and as my consciousness fades away, I don't say anything, but here's what I think in a split-second. I think of my friends that I have spent so much time with. I think of Keyleth, beautiful, walking under the trees. I think of my twin sister as a young girl, folding up linens with our mother. I think of my sister as an adolescent in lessons, smarter than me. I think of the woman she grew into. Hiking over many, many, many miles together. My best friend. My best friend, Vex'ahlia. And before I can think no more, I say a prayer to Sarenrae to watch over my friends and keep them safe. Eight. You can sit right here! He eats at the table with us all the time! She taught him to sit in a chair. What's going on around here? Do I make a death saving throw? 17. I succeeded. Wait, I'm at one? Haggling. She loves me. Does Seeker Asum get a save now that he's been hit, to shake that charm? Carry the three... I feel like I'm going insane! They're looking at me? She doesn't feel even a little bit horny? As he reloaded, weakly, behind him, I go, hi, Percy. And I have a question. At some point I'm in the mix? To do what? To grapple check? Do I have to roll, too? So I roll, as well. Yeah, fuck that guy. For hitting? Yeah, because it's a hit point sponge. You have to tell me what's possible. I'm prone, right? This is what I'd like to do. You tell me if it's possible. I'd like to click my boots of haste together and then get up, which takes my full movement? What does it take? Half my movement. This is what I want to do, you tell me if it's possible. Click my boots of haste, get up, use disengage again, and then run like a motherfuck straight towards-- That's what I want to do. My sister. And as I run past, I share a very awkward glance with Keyleth and keep going and just run and lock eyes with my sister and run at her. But that's a lucky number. Are they Superman and Wonder Woman? What the heck? Please make it funny. Okay, I'm going to throw one dagger at Briarwood's face. That's a one. If I'm hasted, can I do two potions? Instead of attack, attack, attack. All right, so I'm taking a potion of greater healing and walking backward. Walking distance. And greater healing is 4d4, right? What was it before that? He's ragged! Go! If we're ever going to get them, we need to get them now! Lead the way, Percival! Wow. Real talk, the winner here tonight is me. I walk forward and slap my hand on the guard's arm and say, we saved Uriel, you will stand down now. Uriel would not be alive if not for the people around you now. She's fine. Walk away. You realize your lord would not be alive now were it not for us, don't you? They bit me. I don't feel right. I think I need to go to a temple. I think I'm dangerous. You need to put me in the dungeon very soon. (calling out) Tiberius! Oh, do we see them? You can have whatever mages you want cast truth on me. I was bitten. This threat is real. We have earned your trust, have we not? I totally eat it and just hit the ground. I'm so glad that didn't happen. You didn't shit yourself, so you're a winner. What the-- Oh. Is it sticky? Who didn't know that here, honestly. Yeah. Listen, doc, I can't bite anybody here. Are you sure? What do you mean, unnatural? Probably will. Spreading the good word. Oh dear. Sorry! Is that blessed holy water? I'm sorry. I'll pay for that. She's thriving. That was a little ham-fisted, but he does speak the truth. Gilmore makes a quality item. That was very awkward, Scanlan, but it's true. If you say Vax'ildan sent you, you might get 15. (laughs) Oh, tomorrow, you mean? (yelling) I'm alive! I am sorry to everyone watching at home for blowing out the mic, but gods damn it, I'm alive. I thought that I could get a peeky-poo at what they actually were, who they were, and let's face it, I fucked up is what I did. And Grog? You may shave off my pubic region, or draw a dick on my head, if you want, tomorrow. Vex'ahlia, I'm sorry for not staying close by. Scanlan, we're good. Tiberius, you are smart and I am very stupid. You are extremely handsome and I am ugly. And I'm sorry. And Percy, I'm especially sorry. To you most of all. We weren't ready, you weren't ready. Is that your last name? I lost track after the D. It'll be two weeks, at least, before I do anything-- I lean in, and I lick his nose with my own tongue. And then I let him lick me all over the place. Yeah? I love you, Grog. Would you like to draw balls on my forehead? I don't move at all. I just take it. Yeah. What about your room, Tiberius? And are they at the door? Where are they? We're outdoors? We've left the temple? 13. Ooh! Buy a vowel. Little bit of Kit. Trinket gets two attacks. I think you should erase that and write seven. Don't hit Trinket! (laughs) Oh my god! Think of how handy that would've been against the Briarwoods. ORION  Four, five, six. Okay, I'm going to roll these. This is the time. Right here, right now. "I didn't watch Matlock--" Kill that motherfucker! Killed that old woman so good. Vax'ildan flips him the double birds as he hits the wall. That's unfortunate! Can I use Uncanny Dodge with it? Or is it too late? Okay, so I look around at all these amazing people that I am so blessed to be with and barely even looking, I just go dagger, dagger, dagger over this asshole's head at the Broker. Yeah. The first one is, not that great, but it's all right. It's an 18. These guys are dickheads. All right. That's ten points of damage. The second dagger hits him, I hope. 19? For ten points of damage. And then I'll throw my Dagger of Venom at him, see what happens. Oh, the same hit, same amount. The last one hit. This one hits. That is three, six, nine. Plus, he has to make a saving throw against a DC 15 for poison. Yeah, go fuck yourself. That's not the right die is what that is. Let's see, poison damage is-- that's not great. Ten. Ten points of poison. You are awesome! (whooshing) Kit Buss is not a bad guy! Where I am. I'll stay where I am Damn, son! Percival de something something something de Rolo the III, you badass motherfucker! Picked a bad day to do your job, son! (old lady voice) I feel happy. I feel alive. Wow. Going for the roleplay, not the damage. (gasps) You nasty woman, you. You've got a naughty streak. That old lady has to die! (old lady voice) I feel fine. I feel happy. This is like an afternoon at the gym for us. Littlest character sheet ever. Can you hold that up again? Look how tiny it is! Aw, that big bear and that tiny piece of paper. Poor old woman? She's an evil mercenary. She deserves to be taken out! Don't be ageist! That is an evil bitch! She needs to be killed. No. Let him live. Let this one live. Oh, I'm sorry I retract that. Did you just hit Keyleth's funny bone? Grog, will you kill this guy? I know what to do-- Scanlan. This is your moment. Shit on his face. Who are you kidding? My sister's right. Do it on his chest. It was almost my turn. Can I throw daggers at him? You reanimated him? Oh then, never mind. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Scanlan? Tibs? Who wants a wand? Plus? Plus zero. (singing) Scanlan make you feel good. All we care about is deeds. You've proven yourself to great depth today. And as the twins are walking I say, clearly, I'm eating shit here today. I guess I'm going to make a promise not to stray from your side. I promise. Can I hold your mug? I want to see what it feels like. Wow! Look at the size of that. Yes. If I ever died, I thought-- and I still think I'll probably be the first-- but if I ever died, I thought it would be more like a bus accident. I would just go (impact) and that'd be it. I didn't think the doctor would look at me and say, I'm sorry, you have one week to live. And the whole week I've been sweating. Yeah, thanks guys, for putting the pressure on.
