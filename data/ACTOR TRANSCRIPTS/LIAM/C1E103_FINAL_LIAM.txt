Will you also someday have a Pog episode? Shut your mouth! What kind of cards? Taliesin, you looked taller in that Signal Boost. I just thought of four people that fit that bill and decided not to say any of their names. The guy who's running Canada is very young, so we're going to have to wait a while. What's on your mind, Sam? Spin-off. Your enemy. Vecna. He's come... he's come back to our world. My home. My family is in danger. The world is in danger. I don't know. That or grind us all into dust. We traveled to the Shadowfell. There was a tower, and he had servants. He had powerful servants. A woman that we've fought before, and another, a man, a creature. I don't know. With a blade, a dark blade. And he was too powerful for us. He crushed us. He threw me to the ground the first second he laid his eye on me. He murdered my sister. I thought we had come to an arrangement. Where is my sister? No. No! Come back. No! I will not leave them behind. I want to help them, still. Whatever it takes. You have such loneliness in your eyes. I do. Sure. Pickle? Hi. Where are we? I'm not entirely sure. I died. Did you know that? What are you going to do? Sorry, I'm a little confused. Oh, fuck. I thought you died. I watched you die. I'm sorry I'm naked. Come here. I'm all right. I don't know. I died. But you're back. I'm so glad you're back. Don't cry. Yeah, I'm really here. What's the matter, Pike? And she's really short. Listen, I'm a cleric. It's nothing I haven't seen before. You clear diseases. I don't know. Yeah. Fred, it's fine. I hand the armor over to my sister. Oh, I didn't get it yet? I thought she put it in my hands. All right. You created a temple for me. You know who I serve. You would know if there's evil in my heart. You would know if there's evil in my heart. You would. I'm very confused. No. He's absolutely right. This is insane. (weak laughter) I remember hitting the ground, and I remember watching you die, and then it was her face again. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead. Get it out of the way. I'm not worried about it. If I'm undead, then I shouldn't be here with you, all of you. Where is Keyleth? You used to give me wet willies in Abyssal class. It's me. What? Oh shit. Well, that's extra. Hi. You? No. Nobody could have done more for me. No. Am I? I probably should put some clothes on, then. I'm not taking it. Well, you can guess some of it. You all have seen her, the same as I have. She did not say I'm a fucking ghoul. Yeah. Hey. What's up, Poobah? Ooh. Hi. What is that? What? She's like Sarenrae. Pike, she's a god. Can someone lend me a knife? I didn't take it. I don't know. I was about to tell you everything she told me, but I've changed my mind. (laughter) Years ago. Year and a half ago. She was a bit more specific. She doesn't like our new play pal. Yeah. It was death or come back and help you. That's one way of looking at it. I don't have a lot of experience with other gods making deals, darling. But I want you to live a long time. And I want you two to live a long time and be happy. And I want you to get a halfway decent relationship with your daughter. I want you to lead many people. I want you to change the world. I want you to do all the things I know you can do. Forget it. Grog, I just want you to be free. So much better than the old Vax. Look, any one of us could die at any time! We have died. Some of us more than once. It's a miracle that I'm here now. I've lived a very good life. And it's not just us. The dragons were a test. This fucking lunatic, this dead thing. He's not setting up a theme park, guys. Yeah. Don't set your expectations too high. No, I have to be naked all the time. Change the rules of the game. Wait until the countdown's done, then you say something foul. I got this, I got this, (fake belch). God, the grass is really cold. Thank you. These are better. They're Velcro. Why did we need diamonds? That makes no sense. We can't do this alone. That's a start. Artagan is a good start. We need... Higher powers here, yes. That's a start. Pickle, I actually mean a little more than that. Well, we have one god heavily in our corner, but we need to go and beseech the help of others. We are not enough, in this instance. We need to fucking go and talk to Sarenrae. You can take us anywhere. The gods? You don't think the gods exist, after all you've seen, Grog? What else have we been doing for the last year and a half but knocking on different dimensional doors? Where could you not talk your way into, Scanlan Shorthalt? We start in Vasselheim. Oh, to Sarenrae? I don't think they're in the same place. I'm going to assume that sometime in the last year and a half, these two have told you that I dipped into a bathtub full of blood. You just weren't paying attention, buddy. The temples in Vasselheim are old. The oldest, including the temple that you helped pull out of the dirt. If anywhere is attuned to the gods, it is Vasselheim. There you go. Pelor lives here. Pelor. All of us, your family. Let's go back to your temple. We're on a ticking clock, here. Worked for me. Is that how it works? Is there a city on top of the city? No, it's charm or sleep. Damn it! I used luck and I rolled the same thing on both. For charm and sleep? We'll call this a victory for you. You have won this day. Scanlan Shorthalt is your name. We're in Vasselheim. We're in Vasselheim. Mine, or Vecna's? It's whenever he remembers. I actually have this. Duskmeadow? 19. Do I have a sense of distance, or just direction? Vec-dar. What's your Vecna, Victor? The burn that I feel. There's no question what it is for him. You don't hear any of that shit. It's in my head. So I'm going to need those boots back. Because I'm a missile. Well, you think about it. You think about what you've done. I know you'll do the right thing, eventually. Is he a god? We don't have a lot of time, so do you think you could split off with somebody? To your temple. I'm pretty sure we want your brain around, Percy. I know you're uncomfortable around all this shit, but I want you to fucking suck it up. I mean, she's okay. I don't think we do. I don't think we do. Grog, are you splitting off? You can stay on task, though, right? Yeah, I think you need a minder. Do you see this? He's relaxed. Maybe. Yeah. I just know what my patron charged me with. That doesn't mean I understand what it means, so I think we should start with one. Want to take a knee, everybody? You looked blissful. We all hear Scanlan Shorthalt's voice in our minds. And we're waiting on a guy, too, aren't we? The lady, Sheila, ran off-- Are these things Pike knows because of her expertise, or does everyone in the world know a certain amount about? I think it's Bidetsday. Yeah, Bidetsday. Let's see. Bidetsday. Hey, buddy, you missed your window! I will note that Vax feels a slight sense of bittersweet pride at the amount of bliss that Pike just went through. Just a little bit. Everybody at the table is broken! (laughter) Sarenrae comes down and says, never mind! 13. Next week, a prison break. It was like 30. We just said goodbye to you. And also, dear. The communication system that you and Percival and Tary set up. Is it here? Where's the closest? Well, we've got two things on our plate, right? We need to start-- Yes. Yes. We're going to do that, we're just getting the word out. While you were selling stuff on the black market, Keyleth and Freddie here have been building this system. They built it. In all the major cities, they can get out an alarm. Let people know. Do you remember how bad the Conclave was? That's what we're talking about here. I'm getting too old for this shit. You used to be a 4th or 5th-level cleric, and now we're here! Started in Stillben, now we're here! MARISHA and I'm not undead! I have a heartbeat, a slow heartbeat, and meat.
