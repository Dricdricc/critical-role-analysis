I'll just kiester this one. Are you simultaneously brewing at home right now? Oh. Wow. Does she know or is this the proposal? Separation anxiety is a real thing. It took you years to do that. I'm two minutes in, so I'll grieve a little bit longer. It's fine. I just have a low tolerance for bullshit, and I'd like to get past this little piece of shit that we're being made to swallow. Not a lot. That's what I'm concerned about. We lost our meat shield and we don't have Pike. So I think we probably need to go and get some potions. How many have you got? Can I have one? Thank you. Do we have the flying carpet? (imitating Grog) We took the flying carpet. Sorry. (imitating Grog) I would like to bogart the flying carpet and everything in the fucking Bag. (imitating Grog) Am I texting you that right now? All right, let's go to the store. I don't really want to drag this out any longer than we have to. And I walk out the door and start going. Look at those fingers fly. Old one, are you still willing to trade today? I'm wondering if you have any poisons beyond the run-of-the-mill nightshades this afternoon or morning? What do you want for it? Why not? Yoink. As we're leaving, I say, that's a good look. Thank you. We're right in the middle of the bazaar. Do we want to take a quick jog around? I grab someone passing by and say, you, potions? Where? Here? I did not know that. Thank you. Well, shit. I grab another weirdo passing by and say, excuse me. There's probably a temple around here. Can you point us in the right direction? I'm getting itchy. Can we just go to the Take please? Are we going to the temple or the Take? Let's get on with it, shall we? Jesus, whoever that is. Oh, he was sweet. He had some good herb. They already headed out? Excuse me? Fantastic. Not good at reading emotions. I don't. Vax'ildan. What's your thing? What do you do? I agree. Let's hurry it up, Merkin. Shall we? I'm not from these parts. It's my accent. Sorry. Skip to the punchline. Tiger man. Essentially. Storybooks in Syngorn. Does this cat have a name? And you have no further information? Are there any grumpkins you want us to find? Do you expect us to go out with no information at all to find a man with a tiger's head? Is this how things normally go around here? He's not very good. Oh, he's gone. What's your name again? I'm sorry. Kash. Brother Kash, are you new to the Guild, as well? That's how we got here. All right. I'm sorry. I'd like to make an insight check on the dwarf, not to see if he is lying, but he could be. Can I get a gut instinct into what his deal is? Three, but I'm going to use my Luck to try that again. 18 plus two is 20. Just reinforce the myth, man. Is there a marshmallow center? And that's not just a descriptor, either. In the walls of the city? Follow the axe. Why are you jonesing for a horse? And where we're walking, are there shops and stands, as well, or is it residential? I'm pulling a mask off the wall. This is a beautiful piece. Do you make them yourself? They are quite beautiful. We're travelers here. I've never seen a neighborhood like this. Is there a festival going on here, or is this pretty much the basic fare of the day here? Here particularly, there seems to be electricity in the air almost. It's very bustling. This is the norm around here? And I pull out ten gold, and I spread them on her desk. Oh, none. I slide one coin away from the other nine, and then dragging my finger across those say, is there anything out of the ordinary these days? 15. Watching her, I pull out another five and spread them in front of the first nine. The Bastions what are they? Mauled? And can you point us in the right direction? These guys are right here, essentially? I notice a serpent-shaped mask on the wall. I just pick it up and put it on and say, thank you, madam. Much obliged. And walk off and clap Thorbir on the shoulder and keep walking. Well, we're in a rush, but if it's easy. How do you come by potions in this town? My hood goes up, and I'm gone. I'm circling around. 31. Everybody talks about spontaneous combustion, but I'd never believed it. Naughty. And while he has their attention, I'm going to check out his pockets. Ew, that's not good. I'm going to use Luck. That's better. That's all right. Perception, you said? 28. Because I'm wearing a Cloak of Elvenkind, which I know affects stealth checks but not-- That's all right. 20. And Lord Tyrell factored in how? We've pumped these guys for all they've got. Tyrell was passing through. I wonder how many people would notice him gone here in Vasselheim. This killer could be hiding in plain sight at the Cabaret. Could be an employee there. The thing is vanishing upon sight. My question is we have three days, Cabaret's the only lead we have. How do we draw this person, he or she, out? We have three days to collar it. I've spent time with wealth. Half-elves. Let's go. I jingle what gold I have in a pouch in front of Keyleth's face and say, let's go shopping. Come on. As the rakshasa bears down on your head. They're legit. Stealth. Disadvantage on my next five attacks. (laughter) That's really weird. Elivr is nice. Coralin. I will be Scanlan Shorthalt. No, you can't do that. I'm just saying it's weird. I have a twin, yes. To the Cabaret. Bodyguard, yes. Of course. Of course I'll have a human, being elven. Yeah, we're walking and talking. And you're changed into a gnome. Boy or girl? Lord Scanlan of the Shorthalts. Of the Shorthalts. We have a cobbling empire. Shoes. We cater mostly to halflings and gnomes. Everyone, but specifically because they're so underserved. Rolling in it, baby. We're wonderful partners, dear. Do you want to be? Is that weird? You're an advisor. A financial advisor. I fold her arm in and walk forward. Scanlan of the Shorthalts. We come from Emon. I sell shoes. We sell shoes. We do. We're hoping to sample the atmosphere here. Is there entertainment? We heard there was great entertainment. This is Thorlaxalux, my financial advisor. I cling and hand my glass to Thorbir. Look to Thorbir and then look in the room. I seat Coralin and have a seat myself. And pretending to check out the women in the room, I make a perception check. And that is a 16. Oh, if anything sets off my alarm bells. And the room itself? I'm the lucky man who married her. My name is Scanlan of the Shorthalts. We're in from Emon, and reputation of this establishment is well known within all parts of the walls. We're looking to possibly become members here. We hear the entertainment is top-notch, and we hear that business happens within these walls. But I'm not convinced. I'm hoping to stay for an hour to see what you have to offer. When I find I like a place, I stay for a long time and leave a lot of money. I'd just like a little taste. Using my last Luck of the day. That's better. 15. We hail from Emon. We're not very flashy. We certainly don't do much in public in Emon. I prefer to make my money and enjoy my money and I don't believe in ostentation. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy the form of a beautiful woman as much as the next man. Who said I do? My wife and I are businessmen. And what we hear is that this is where business happens. The shoes are the public face, but the well runs deep. I know my way around poison, and I hear you have the rarest of breeds here. I have come to spend some money to satisfy my clients. 15 again. 15 again. I'm not looking to sell. I'm looking to buy. We're here to stop a murderer. Bodies have been showing up outside this building. Multiple bodies. We're not going to get into the details, but we've been sent here to stop that from happening any further. Look at this guy. Does he look like he's fucking around? Now, you must be aware of this problem. Can't be a surprise to you. People are starting to take notice in this city. This was inevitable. Insight check, insight check. Balls. That makes my ten look titanic. She's in New Zealand. The other side of the Earth. Who's in this room? It's the women-- Vince is the-- But is he human? He's sometimes hard to follow, but you don't want to fuck with him. I walk forward, I pull out Dagger of Venom and I drop a little bead of black down the blade and I hold it just about a centimeter under his neck. I've all run out of patience, friend. We're here to help this city and you're going to help us. Talk. 20. Now or later, friend. Perception check. 23. Mouse, rat. I'm going to bap this guy in the head. I'm going to just flip the blade and strike him across the forehead. Okay, so on a surprise, it's advantage. So 19's pretty good. I'll take the 19 over the two. So that's 19 plus-- 30. Okay, sneak attack damage. Is this a surprise because he didn't know it was coming? It is? So because of my assassinate feat, then this is a critical hit. So just the sneak attack damage? Okay, four, eight, ten, 12, 15, 21, 42. Gentlemen, we need to move. Mama Cass, what have you found? Not great. Nine. You're speaking Draconian! You left her with him? I shove past him and go straight through the door. Don't run blindly in there, hold on. I'm going to run just up past Keyleth, I'm going to look at her as I pass. Not bad. Keep going, stop there, and now I'm going to try to sense traps. If I use, that's fine, yeah. Okay. 21. Okay. I look at Kash and Keyleth and say-- Are we out of initiative? We're still in initiative. He's glam rock. Glam rock. Not bad, Tiberius. Just a moment, dear. Pull out the same poisoned blade and start walking down that hall a little further, and I want to see if I sense any traps further ahead. Natural 20. Oh. Okay. And those are doors up there? Would that check include the doors themselves? All right. Pressing my ear to the door on my left. So many. Six. I want to do it at the other door as well. That one's a 19. Kick in the door. Hard as I can. Wait, that's the wrong guy. 12. 14. Keyleth-- Coralin, darling, could you come up here please? Yeah. I think I want to get this door open quickly, please. A one! You have to throw it into the fire, Mr. Frodo! This is like science class. I slap myself on the forehead and go ugh. Pull out thieves' pick and start on the lock. The freshmaker. Yeah, let's try to leave the room. That's better. That's a 24. I should've done that in the first place. I turn my head to everyone and just mouth the words-- and perception check the room. 24. 24. They call me Benny. Benny Hill. I would like to run up the bed and stab up. Both hands. Clicking the Boots of Haste. I'm going to check the ceiling. There's a lot of perception. I'm all out of Luck. That's no good. That's a 14. I motion Tiberius over. Come on. Hey! We're not silenced, right? So I'm yanking off any fancy clothes I have on and I'm pulling my Cloak of Elvenkind out. I'm putting it over. And I spider under the bed and check it for traps. 25 for looking for traps. Is there dim light down there? You can see in pitch black, right? Is that dim or dark? I'll go behind Kash. I'm looking over Thorbir's head and looking for traps as he walks from behind. 22. Wait a tick. I'm going to go up to the edge of it and try to inspect it and see if I can find a trigger or see how it works. Six. And that is, what is that, perception? I want to see if I can disarm. That's a 19. Again. 12. I would like to cast all of my spells in succession for the next ten minutes. Let's walk. Shall we walk? I think we should walk. Well, the higher one was four. The lower one was a one. You got this. I think I'd rather walk as long as I can. 16. We can't even hear you anymore. You're miles away. Hey, you guys! Shitter's full! Rat horde. Congratulations, you've won imploding self-esteem. After enough time, you can suck people into it. It'll be a 20. 19. (laughter)
