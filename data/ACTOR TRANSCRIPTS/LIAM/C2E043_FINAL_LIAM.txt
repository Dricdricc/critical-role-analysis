I can choose which side the wall burns, 10-feet reach, and which side does not. 001402.034 --> 001404.080 This table can't bear my weight. 001409.815 --> 001414.122 I don't know how I would make it go on an angle without causing problems. 001428.125 --> 001430.356 Best I can. 001433.980 --> 001435.667 Well, this isn't what I imagined in my head, but we are standing where we are standing, so I'm 001442.555 --> 001443.815 going with what I see. 001443.815 --> 001444.548 Okay, I want that to go like that, but it's not going. 001452.338 --> 001454.269 I would like the last one to be on this gentleman. 001502.110 --> 001504.889 Leaving room to get to this gangway, but he's burning and that's going like this. 001509.462 --> 001510.685 Facing this to there, also allowing access to both the gangplanks-- 001518.985 --> 001525.425 (clattering, laughter) 001525.425 --> 001527.311 I can't make them stick, man! 001540.845 --> 001547.578 Fucking real D&amp;D, people. It went better in rehearsal. 001604.735 --> 001609.384 We all know-- I'm not going to touch it-- the gangplanks are open. 001612.533 --> 001614.838 That's right. He's just out of your line of sight. 001618.447 --> 001630.638 It's a ten-foot reach on the outside of this thing. 001659.799 --> 001702.979 On the outside. I choose the side, so clearly I'm not going to burn us. 001708.725 --> 001711.681 Shit! Bad rolls. 17 total. 001722.264 --> 001725.735 A one, a two, and a three were the first three rolls. 001734.059 --> 001740.745 Also to toss out the flames are opaque, so they cannot be seen through. 001745.196 --> 001754.036 Eight. 001930.985 --> 001937.976 Okay. It's wedged into my belt. Yeah, okay. 002034.908 --> 002039.791 Counterspell. 002206.896 --> 002211.094 I know, and it's at disadvantage. (gasps) 002214.588 --> 002216.596 I rolled a 14 and a 19! She fails! 002219.057 --> 002220.121 Can I hear her go (arcane chanting)? 002254.190 --> 002255.615 Oh, natural 20 and a 16, plus perception-- The lowest roll was a 19. 002312.183 --> 002314.312 I never do. 002315.258 --> 002319.825 Are you asking-- Oh you're asking me. 003033.139 --> 003034.732 If they end their turn or the first time it hits them... 003037.571 --> 003042.208 When it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. 003045.501 --> 003047.967 Moves or clears the-- 003114.052 --> 003117.322 24 that time. 003154.273 --> 003157.821 24. 003159.833 --> 003205.820 That's going to hit. 003216.998 --> 003221.154 Absolutely. 003222.472 --> 003232.873 It's a ten right, because it's half. 003234.609 --> 003239.630 At disadvantage. 003240.890 --> 003242.511 Oh, saving throw? Well I rolled twice. 003244.248 --> 003246.081 Straight, because they were both pretty good. Natural 20. 003248.569 --> 003251.289 (relieved cheering) 003251.289 --> 003301.707 Hits, yeah. 003303.088 --> 003313.068 That's balls. That is just a seven. 003320.736 --> 003330.240 Does the cloud remain in the sky? 003735.165 --> 003736.370 Okay, so it was a one time. 003737.696 --> 003738.655 Oh yeah, okay. 003910.225 --> 003911.227 Are there any crates or anything around on the dock that look lift-able from Catapult? 003915.828 --> 003917.725 Okay, if they look light enough, I will throw one up into the air at Avantika's head. 003927.783 --> 003932.624 No. I am going instead to cast Expeditious Retreat on myself and at the same time change the 003947.566 --> 003959.510 focus on my transmuter stone to a constitution buff. That's it. I'm going to jet back 90 feet. 003959.510 --> 004000.994 It hits. 004435.385 --> 004437.107 My AC is 11. 004438.746 --> 004443.474 Oh, I have nine hit points. 004449.636 --> 004450.565 Yeah.

My body is radiating heat. I'm hot everywhere. Flames! On the 005624.732 --> 005626.996 side of my face! 005626.996 --> 005629.462 That was a sick description! 005745.114 --> 005749.085 That was like Babe Ruth summoning a demon from hell. 005755.050 --> 005757.971 60 feet from Caleb at this point. I was 90 feet from Fjord. 005943.652 --> 005946.554 Dex bonus? 010104.600 --> 010106.279 (Bane impression) Your punishment will be more severe. 010121.471 --> 010123.786 This is fucking chaos. 010144.227 --> 010156.194 Anything that keeps her occupied for one round, but still. 010453.198 --> 010455.263 She's dead. Oh, no, she passed out. 010714.957 --> 010721.235 That is-- these dice-- That's a 17. 010730.841 --> 010732.232 Yeah. 010732.848 --> 010733.889 (guard impression) "What's all this, then?" 010755.402 --> 010806.306 Nothing but sparkle pony fur. 010943.364 --> 010946.882 FYI, if I'd stayed conscious, I would've thrown a Fireball at that boat. 011421.805 --> 011424.536 That was my next move. 011425.783 --> 011433.150 Sam Riegel, shut the fuck up! 011622.603 --> 011628.839 With great power. 011701.882 --> 011709.200 I'm angry at the villain; that's what I'm supposed to be! 011721.767 --> 011722.570 You're doing great, everything is fantastic, I'm having a wonderful time! 011725.026 --> 011728.458 My ears are going to combust! 011730.939 --> 011739.476 It's so in character. 011752.737 --> 011756.335 So an unnatural one. 012121.967 --> 012123.972 Six rounds. 012134.823 --> 012136.460 TRAVIS and That's fine. Six rounds of carnage. 012138.870 --> 012141.130 (nonsensical rabble rousing) 012347.697 --> 012351.332 Yeah, good call. 012435.881 --> 012438.907 95 or 100 feet. 012550.259 --> 012554.625 30 feet. 012737.113 --> 012740.313 (groaning) Hey. I think I skinned my face. Ah! Done. I don't know what's going on. 012853.301 --> 012859.234 Fist to the skull! 013150.880 --> 013154.691 I'm just-- 013258.976 --> 013302.830 What is my distance from the boat? 013314.678 --> 013320.371 160 feet? If I got to my feet, that's half my movement. 013324.230 --> 013325.387 If I moved ten feet I'd be within 150 feet, correct? Yeah? 013330.392 --> 013331.618 So I will weakly stand, and I will weakly trudge ten feet forward, and I will throw a 013338.761 --> 013343.812 Fireball and center it-- where's Vera? 013343.812 --> 013347.467 Well, where's Avantika? I don't know. 013352.878 --> 013354.369 I'm putting it there, at the mast. 013356.627 --> 013406.638 I don't know what's going on. I'm doing the last thing that was on my mind. 013422.710 --> 013424.362 8d6. 013425.952 --> 013432.000 She will. 013433.996 --> 013435.671 31. 013446.298 --> 013447.778 Yes, good rolls. 013448.891 --> 013454.702 So Caleb's whole face and cheek, one side is skinned. 013458.637 --> 013506.903 Oh, on mine? That would be on mine-- sorry, everybody. <i>Scheisse</i>. I think it's 16? 013526.677 --> 013531.823 Yeah, 16. 013533.033 --> 013542.429 They saw the Fireball go over their heads, yes. 013654.482 --> 013710.226 Multiple? 013744.260 --> 013745.974 Yeah, I'm sure it's going to fail. This is a wisdom? 18. 013756.613 --> 013805.533 That's a good deal. Yes, yes, yes! 014021.466 --> 014025.115 It's their new limited edition. 014225.458 --> 014228.842 A thousand years of D&amp;D! 014256.426 --> 014258.937 Matt, we have played this game for hundreds of hours together. That was two of the best hours 014339.435 --> 014342.443 of this game <i>ever</i>! That was so much fun. 014342.443 --> 014344.275 No! It was so good! 020639.700 --> 020641.807 (whispers) You crazy motherfucker. 021108.116 --> 021109.638 Yeah. 021419.381 --> 021422.332 Well, I've noticed that they're not letting any of us cast anything, correct? 021446.017 --> 021448.117 Then no. I would do Mage Armor, but no. 021450.743 --> 021453.479 Motherfucker. 021456.202 --> 021457.903 Then in these circumstances, I would dismiss Frumpkin from the Material Plane and bring him 021514.240 --> 021517.075 back on my shoulder, so he's with me. 021517.075 --> 021523.965 He's friendly. That's my pet cat. 021532.008 --> 021535.698 I'm thinking really bad thoughts. 021548.431 --> 021555.647 Yeah, it's wedged into the back page. 021823.664 --> 021827.491 Excuse me, I am the one who deciphered this. That is near the end. 021902.639 --> 021904.695 As you will, if that is welcome here, but yeah. The bit about her being a traitor to the 021915.646 --> 021923.283 Plank King, and wanting to rule over the entire sea, and have the Plank King-- I believe the words 021923.283 --> 021930.855 are, if I remember correctly, because my memory is spotty, "bend the knee." 021930.855 --> 021932.473 Is near the end, <i>ja</i>, right here. 021934.231 --> 021935.672 It's complex. 021936.426 --> 021945.068 I would like to read her as well. 022159.039 --> 022201.193 At disadvantage. 022202.676 --> 022204.202 22 for me. 022215.584 --> 022224.288 Caleb sees it! Go away, Fjord! Go away! 022229.246 --> 022232.632 Holy shit. 022704.995 --> 022706.618 <i>Mein Gott.</i> 022808.773 --> 022813.002 (whispering) Silence speaks volumes, though. 022844.691 --> 022851.295 I worked through the night on that. It's very interesting. 023029.937 --> 023034.343 Breakfast. 023036.066 --> 023038.850 He is so stoned. 023159.994 --> 023209.771 You counterbalanced the rest of this game! 023328.473 --> 023331.765 Has that happened since the walk of shame? 023339.728 --> 023341.014 Two years ago. 023344.389 --> 023352.561 <i>Ja,</i> we will take the bigger boat! 023442.007 --> 023446.891 No. 023501.017 --> 023503.053 No. 023503.957 --> 023504.986 We have our crew. We do not need them. 023506.545 --> 023508.383 I'll be doing that at disadvantage. 023718.904 --> 023720.179 20 percent of the damage? 023814.791 --> 023815.627 Yes, but the upside was so-- 023843.122 --> 023844.363 Yeah, 20 feet tall. For six to 12 seconds. That didn't last more than two rounds. 023852.821 --> 023854.699 Absolutely. 023855.771 --> 023902.464 (gasps) (pigeon coos) Paint on the mast. 023906.414 --> 023911.058 I have a question. If I finally go to bed for like 14 hours-- Minor Alchemy for a 024008.246 --> 024014.093 transmutation wizard. I am able to perform an alchemical procedure on one object composed 024014.093 --> 024020.383 entirely of wood, stone, iron, copper, silver, and transform it into another material. If there was 024020.383 --> 024025.369 damage to the mast, would I be able to shove other things in there and turn it to wood? That seems 024025.369 --> 024027.872 like too much. 024027.872 --> 024029.956 It's a spell that I could've done, but I didn't take that spell. I chose Counterspell. 024033.850 --> 024037.175 I sell falchions and-- 024212.132 --> 024216.664 Yeah, we survived and-- 024218.528 --> 024221.541 They're magnifying, Matt? Where'd you get those? 024223.841 --> 024228.398 So we're going right into her vagina. 024241.409 --> 024244.943 There ain't no fucking port around here, motherfucker. 024258.916 --> 024304.936 Max Headroom, coming at you from the mid-80s! W-w-what? 024314.902 --> 024317.886 Yeah. Matt is just barely old enough to know what that is. 024323.572 --> 024325.103 I said you know what it is! Just barely. 024328.307 --> 024332.271 He was in The Stand as the Trashcan Man. 024339.204 --> 024345.333 Are you doing that? 024433.349 --> 024436.744 If we're talking about, like business shit, Caleb is going to Beau and saying I'm sorry, I 024615.819 --> 024621.561 know that this has been less than ten days, but I need my cat, so I am taking my owl, I apologize. 024621.561 --> 024635.420 On a side note, so impressed. I walk off with my little tiny one-ounce owl. 024635.420 --> 024636.466 I will take the time to turn Frumpkin- I have two uses left with incense- back into a 024641.884 --> 024649.558 Bengal cat. So he can live his best life as a Bengal cat. 024649.558 --> 024652.128 Diplomatic cat-munity. 024705.303 --> 024711.255 Oh right. I rolled an 18 and a 19 ten minutes ago. 024911.534 --> 024915.171 I rolled an investigation check ten minutes ago at disadvantage and the lower is a 27. My 024948.290 --> 024950.896 investigation is plus eight. I'm smart-- 024950.896 --> 024952.041 Yes. I rolled an 18 and a 19. 024954.569 --> 024958.255 Are there any more gigantic hats? 025023.473 --> 025025.490 Gigantic hats. 025028.176 --> 025029.287 Are you in this room with us too, right now? 025216.473 --> 025219.143 Yeah. I'm sitting on the bed right now. 025309.889 --> 025312.745 Wait a second, look at me. I'm sitting on the bed. I am the servant of a demigod. This is 025324.671 --> 025327.248 going to be very hard for Fjord. 025327.248 --> 025328.969 We can get back to what you're talking about, but think about it for a moment; it's just 025337.355 --> 025345.965 the three of us, right? We have our heads in the same game. We are the three assholes in this 025345.965 --> 025347.531 group, yeah? 025347.531 --> 025351.869 That is correct. 025355.025 --> 025357.782 I'm joking because this has been such a hard day, but Fjord is going to find this very difficult. 025404.541 --> 025407.391 That is minimalizing what he is dealing with right now. He is trying to find a father, he has 025420.755 --> 025426.903 compromised himself with this woman for us, for himself, for all of our safety. It is going to be 025426.903 --> 025428.181 difficult for him. 025428.181 --> 025435.080 You have your pluses and your minuses. 025437.993 --> 025448.302 It's mostly true. 025458.927 --> 025500.628 She is too educated. She is too in-the-know to talk the way she does, to be interested in just 025510.405 --> 025519.843 drinking and chasing our barbarian friend. She is very educated. I don't know which parts are true. 025519.843 --> 025523.783 Of course. That is easy. 025553.713 --> 025556.156 Sure, what are friends for. 025559.872 --> 025602.638 No. I am looking forward to getting back to the mainland, and I don't mean the Menagerie 025649.704 --> 025657.470 Coast. Although... We need to get Jester back to her mother if we can, but I am not looking forward 025657.470 --> 025701.091 to being here anymore. I want to get back to the Empire. 025701.091 --> 025708.480 Well, there is still Vandren. I have read every inch of her notes, I have communicated them to you. 025719.490 --> 025725.357 I would imagine the Plank King would not know what to make of it. It clearly damns her. It 025738.515 --> 025742.562 does not give him enough information-- He wouldn't know what to do with it. 025742.562 --> 025744.409 Yeah, he's not a big thinker. He is formidable, but not a big thinker. I think we will 025750.974 --> 025753.851 have an easier time getting to this boat. 025753.851 --> 025757.811 Put a piece of paper back together. 030141.509 --> 030150.194 You do? 030221.292 --> 030222.498 Oh fuck. 030223.713 --> 030225.362 I've been waiting to drop it. Fucking water genasi heritage, man. 030245.359 --> 030248.667 You're so stupid, Rose. 030338.407 --> 030344.500 Do you mean your penis? 030449.007 --> 030450.189 All the pertinent information is also in here. 030658.940 --> 030704.690 Full disclosure, I could help you cope with-- 030801.649 --> 030804.670 Nott the Brave. We have things to accomplish here. If you allow me, I could do what I have done 030828.217 --> 030835.672 in the past a little sneakily to help you cope with this fear you have. If you allow me. 030835.672 --> 030842.415 Is it Mike Myers? 030846.323 --> 030850.588 We're not there yet, though, we're talking in advance at this point? All in advance? 030904.331 --> 030905.173 "Fuh-jord-y!" 031211.948 --> 031213.185 Are we close? What are you telling us? 031521.464 --> 031525.919 I just got my cat back, but if you want an octopus to look on the bottom, you have it. 031541.519 --> 031542.960 Yeah, I have just enough incense to-- yeah sure, let's make an octopus. Cat-shaped. An 031555.615 --> 031557.484 octopus-shaped cat. 031557.484 --> 031600.816 Well, I can tell him to go look and he'll come back to me. I can see through him for-- 031605.390 --> 031607.756 It's a thousand feet. To <i>watch</i>, but he can go and come back, and I trust him. He's Frumpkin. 031616.595 --> 031624.776 I pull out my book and I set it on the deck and I start working on turning <i>my cat</i> into an octopus. 031624.776 --> 031627.262 An hour later, an octopus pops out, if we wait that long. 031636.275 --> 031638.348 Yeah. (sighs) Well, we had one or two days together. Just throw him off. 031647.090 --> 031653.118 So I'll watch for the first thousand feet, but I assume he goes beyond that, because it's the 031710.864 --> 031718.525 ocean, so he keeps going down and down and down. I will tell him to look for this wreck, for what we 031718.525 --> 031721.874 are looking for, and when he finds it to come back and tell me about it. 031721.874 --> 031724.324 13. 031729.244 --> 031737.927 17. 031742.687 --> 031751.523 If he's within 1000, we have a connection. 031759.606 --> 031800.883 A hundred? Thank you. 031801.984 --> 031804.943 Maybe it's 10,000. 031806.309 --> 031811.459 Right, we've established that. I can see indefinitely. That's what we established early in 031816.486 --> 031820.158 the campaign with the circus, but I can't communicate with him. 031820.158 --> 031825.249 I don't hear any of you. 031910.275 --> 031912.238 Ooh, he has found the ship. This is a reminder I can't hear any of you. I don't want to 031922.291 --> 031926.497 disconnect. Don't give me wet willies. 031926.497 --> 031928.428 Who's a good boy?! You are the best cat that was ever put on this planet! 031957.792 --> 032000.893 Oh yeah? 032003.788 --> 032005.561 Oh, come here you. You are the most important member of this team and don't let 032012.337 --> 032016.747 Beauregard tell you different. Or Nott. 032016.747 --> 032020.911 Yeah, that is so silly, isn't it? Silly, yes it is. 032032.021 --> 032034.627 He found the boat, Nott. he found the boat. He will lead us to the boat. He found it. He did it. 032041.306 --> 032042.687 It's the bottom of the ocean. 032054.814 --> 032056.226 It's thousands of feet. 032058.165 --> 032059.651 Thousands of feet. 032101.213 --> 032103.340 You have a method to bring us down there. 032119.534 --> 032120.461 Describe it to me. I've read a bit. Explain it to the goblin. 032123.143 --> 032130.134 That is a whole day. 032131.546 --> 032133.884 Now, you people have not read about-- you don't understand magic. It's not like that. I want 032221.280 --> 032222.941 to try this. 032222.941 --> 032228.809 It's too late. Fjord's in the water, swimming around. 032243.316 --> 032244.590 In minimal amounts, or full dose? 032256.974 --> 032258.260 There was no battle. There was no battle with Avantika, man! 032307.843 --> 032310.173 We're sitting in your mom's sitting room right now. 032315.701 --> 032320.372 I am casting Mage Armor during whatever the fuck this is. 032456.457 --> 032457.089 It's the abyss. 032544.400 --> 032551.739 Yeah, that makes sense. Nott and I are sharing one. 032637.360 --> 032642.472 So Frumpkin is pinwheeling in front of all of us leading the way. 032656.005 --> 032657.210 No, ships don't go to anchor in the middle of the ocean. They just float. 032716.163 --> 032721.516 (popping) 032730.066 --> 032731.817 That's important because I switched the Transmuter's Stone away from darkvision, so I 032752.217 --> 032756.884 cannot see in low light, so it's got to be guiding lights for me. 032756.884 --> 032801.348 He went from level two to three. Doing good. 032934.393 --> 032936.643 They're iron, right? I would say that with Nott piggybacking, Caleb would take his dagger and 033102.151 --> 033106.731 transmute it into iron to meld with the cannonball and grip it that way. 033106.731 --> 033108.671 Thanks. 033112.647 --> 033116.202 Palming it. 033145.590 --> 033148.073 We can? 033325.185 --> 033333.141 There are four globules of light slowly circling around. 033343.685 --> 033350.474 Cannot do that joke anymore. That joke has past. 033405.613 --> 033414.277 Can't see anymore. 033524.777 --> 033533.992 I can't see shit. 033539.108 --> 033540.672 You're good. I'm blind and are you blind? 033544.604 --> 033552.231 Nine. 033630.776 --> 033632.427 One of the best ever. So many great games! 033814.719 --> 033821.766 This campaign is a social experiment. 033859.646 --> 033905.991 All the dead. 033919.041 --> 033920.978 It worked. 033933.685 --> 033937.215 Yeah, it worked. 033940.572 --> 033945.664 (creepy voice) Is it Thursday yet? (growling) 034033.620 --> 034035.393 I'm so upset. (normal voice) Take it away, Matt. 034042.880 --> 034045.919
