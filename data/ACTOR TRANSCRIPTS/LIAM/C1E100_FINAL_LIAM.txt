Tom Hanks was great. Such a min-maxer though Never stop. Oh my gosh, he does covers for everything. Daredevil-- Here it is. (sings) Look at this motherfucker. The splatter. It's farkin' beautiful. Also, like our shirts that you can't tell how soft they are until you're wearing them, like the Joe Mad poster that was so beautiful but until you saw it in person you didn't get it. This thing in person is unbelievable. Yes! Oh. Uh, I don't have any of the shit in front of me! Critrole? Is it Critrole now? It's Critrole again? It's back? Critrole. No one told me. It's just the tip of the iceberg, Matt. Campaign four, I'm waiting for it. Freakin' Willy Loman, man. Take a break. Run away upstate, for the summertime. Take a break! Well, I have a little thing, I just have to share this. Friend of the show, Kiki-- not our Kiki, the other Kiki who's made so many vestiges-- brought me a little something today. (laughing) Maybe he does! Maybe he does. Look at my shoulders! I'm like Travis Willingham! Is this what it feels like, Travis? Man, I've been Crossfitting all day! That's like stitching knitwear, right? Crossfitting all day. Cacaw! Thank you, Kiki. Thank you. Oh my god. This will sit in my office and scare my children. Yeah. Thrown from a distance. Hey, quickly! I shove my sister through the tree. You're not here, I just shoved you through the tree. I made it up, I created it, right there on the fly. I try sticking my fingers through the fake head a little bit. My armor is fire set. Yeah, we're just doing the whole Lawrence of Arabia. Yeah, we're still very awkward. At all times. Bidet! I am very smart. They're rich. This is kind of cool. What are the odds? How are things with the old man? Oh, really? Wonder where she gets it from? Promises, promises. Is that a no? Give it to me, give it to me, I called it as well! Dad, make us roll for it. Why would I do that? I have so much finesse. That's cocked. It was cocked, you say cocked eighty thousand times, and now I'm gonna use Luck, because I wanna beat you. Oh, it's the same thing! So what is this, strength? I will. You go first. Oh, she beat me! (laughter) Hey, T., are you feeling sentimental, being back in Marquet? You've come full circle. New setting. Does it retain the shape of the helmet? No, I'm not wearing a necklace. I didn't actually want it. I just wanted to best you. Can I have the thingie? A pint, though, Grog? A pint? You'd snort that up your left nostril, right? Yeah, that's like you sneezing into a bottle. Absolute conviction. Yeah, but it's more like a stroking thing. You don't just leave your hand in place. What're you telling him lies for? There's a lot of tree science involved. Can you turn an automaton, a robit, into cloud? Did we do that already? Does that work on Doty? Tary. We can camp it up if we need to. Lionel, this is really awesome. For real, you're going to like this. This is 100% the spot? I'll wait until she has looked, and then I'll take a look. Let the expert. What did you find out? Well, Vex went this way. Is it in that direction? Do we see footprints going in a direction, though, you described? But there's a bad door somewhere around here? A bad face. Yeah, slow down, you're doing all the shit. What if they still see the arrow fly in? I'm going to assume that before we heard her gasping, Keyleth was filling us in. I'm going to go check out the top. (mist sound) Well, I'm not going to stick my face in something. Can I stealth as cloud? I'm wind. I'm not going high, I'm going through the treetops. All right, I will. That is very good. That is a 35. I did, it's on the plastic. Oh man. I love you so wholeheartedly, and on a regular basis you kick me in the goolies. I don't understand it. Seven Luck. It's not per game, it's per day, so if we go to bed, it resets. Fart knockers. I'm doing investigation? That's 18. Okay. So it's not a volcanic hole or anything, there's just a secret entrance. I return to my loving sister, kind and good. I land, and say, I saw another face, but I didn't stick my face in it, because that would be stupid. Which I could not find. I mean, only if you want to. I remember that being a sore spot. Could you see through the mouth of this face that you saw, when you were in there? So you couldn't see through the mouth, it was just a dark maw. I'll go with you. Any footprints? Weird. What is it, Kiki? But you saw no footprints inside? Is the plan to camp out tonight? In the mansion, by a fire, whichever? Was the light seen by the arrow? So you're looking at the face. Oh, it keeps going? I will take a look at it, and look at the area and see if there's anything left to it or other traps further down. 19. I'm going to stay 30 feet in front of the group and continue to check for traps. 37. Check for traps, check for traps, check for traps. And are there any tracks or footprints ahead of Pike and I? Survival. Ooh, that's good. 19. Both ways? Shite. Not perception? 21. And is it dead silent in here? 24. Over the earring, not alone. Not alone. Something up ahead. I don't think we're camping. What do y'all want to do? Natural 20. Kiki, a couple more faces. Can you shimmy your way up here, please? Left hand green! Right over there, right up ahead, 30 feet. Both sides. Grab her shoulder, move slowly past, pull Pickle along, and continue to carefully search. 18. That's at least an 18. Oh, it's better than 18. It is 26. We're here for your friends, right? 32. That's not going to work. We've got company coming. I actually stay halfway between both. I'm creeping back. Broken clock. Twice a day. Well done. How's the menu? Wise. Do you want to play some cards or something? Want to go back to, what, your room? Catch up, play cards. Boy, it is more extravagant in here than I remember. No, but there was just one mirror on the ceiling, and now there are three. Yeah, that's weird. Do you want to play cards? Yeah, I'll pretend to know what those are. Let's do hearts. Okay. No idea how to play this game. But Vax does! All right, so catch me up, man! What happened in the beginning? What happened right after you left? First couple of weeks? So how did you get to Marquet? And that somehow stumbled into all this? That is hard to believe. I don't think it's true. Oh, surely not, no. That actually is not surprising. I mean, I'm not going to lie, I think it's pretty cool. I mean, you did save a fucking continent, you are scary. It is true. A bit? You've had a year to clear your head, you think it was just a bit? You know there are multiple times we'd all be dead if it weren't for you. You know that. You know that! And the same could be said for any of us, that's true, but you take any one piece away, and the tower falls. Jenga, man. You know, it was ugly, on all sides, when you left, but I've always understood why you left. I admire it. I wish my dad gave half as much effort as you have this year. Or I used to. Anyway, you know, we've missed you. Everybody has. It is true. And I certainly have, and if I did anything or said anything to make you feel lonely, I'm sorry. I really am. Fucking missed you, man. Fucking every time. I know I miss that flair. Well, I don't know. Yeah, he's good looking. That's true. I don't know that we have-- I mean, we've scattered a bit. I live in Zephra now. I'm on holiday, yeah. Pretty much, yeah. It's all Zephra Heights. No, I'm very happy right now. Yeah. I know. I was happy for a long time. I mean, this is, no! This is part of the bargain. Yeah, but you know I have sunshine in my life every day, so it's all right. Fucking the best, man! It's the fucking best! Yeah. But, you know, all I care about is that you're happier now than you were. You seem a little happier. Well, that's a step up. And Kaylie, is she better off? Well, that's great. Well, again, a lot of hard shit was said on your way out, in many directions, and the way I look at it, it's to be expected. We went through hell together, that's going to have an effect. But even the ones who are angry at you, they did miss you. And family doesn't break apart that easy. Don't scare away. Just be patient. Clap him on the back of the head. I can. I love you, man. It's good to see you. I don't know how to play this game. But thanks for the conversation. That's been about an hour, I think. Yeah. I walk away. Not even chicken salad in this mansion? Said Vex. We wait till morning and we throw Pike out the door. They're all bones. This is a world of magic and delight! Stay in the mansion forever. Back at the breakfast table, just before they make whatever loud sound they're doing It's good, it's almond milk, but I like cream a little bit (explosion). Area of effect, y'all. Come on, cleric. Here he goes. Math. Still math. More math. I walk back to the kitchen and start clearing people's plates. You've got to appreciate that, Travis. I come out with fresh coffee for Percy and Keyleth. What happened? Why is it so tense in here all of a sudden? It's a stupid name. Yes. Everybody quiet down. (whispering) Can I murder one first? (whispering) Thank you. I thought she said the door was just barely open. Now, wait a second. 43. Twins are in the front. (dagger throwing noise) On the left. Oh. 29. And this is assassinate, critical hit. 78 on the first hit. And I use a bonus action for an offhand attack. And I got a critical on it. I rolled a 20. Let's both check. Natural 20. 20. Spick and span. Mack spatter. Thank you. We have a box of crazy shit, will you look at it and tell us what we're looking at? Tary, I am an assassin of the highest caliber. It says that on the paper, Matt? I mean, poorer, but richer. Freddie! Where's Fred? What's this? Well, I think you might like this thing. You could come up with very creative solutions with that. Wait, hold on. Would you like this, either of you? It's not my bag. We should go. Well, let's go quietly, you and I, take point. Twins are in the lead. I rolled a two, so it's a 27. Yeah, you've got to juggle these balls. Twins in the lead, point, traps. All that. 18. Nobody move. Don't move. Sam. I'm using my first Luck of the new day. Okay? The first one of the day. Constitution saving throw? 18, but armor after those faces, is set to necrotic damage. I rolled an 18. Clicking my boots. I'm doing this. 31 perception. Does it sound like anything I've ever heard before? Natural 20. I was wondering. All right. Those 60 seconds have passed. Do you want to go elemental? I'll have a look, as well. 24. I'll roll with Percy and Keyleth. Combat. Here we go! This is the real deal. 15. Sunshine, roll high. Feeblemind on the dragon. Taste the rainbow. Let me just reiterate, we always appreciated Scanlan. So long, pawns. Boots on, poof go the wings. I have two actions left. It's really hard to see. How far am I from skeletal minotaur? And nowhere on the board are any of my allies within melee combat range of any enemy. That's what I figured. Okay, so I'm going to use my two remaining actions to throw daggers at minotaur skeleton. I'm 40 feet away. I'm in range. I didn't say it on the first. I have it if I choose it, but I don't want to choose it. I have sharpshooter. Right, so I ignore three-quarters cover. So the first one is a 19? Good, and the second one-- oh, that hits, for sure. That's a 16... 28. Okay, so for the first one, I'm going to unload some Smite into this motherfucker because I know he's undead. That is three, plus eight is 11, plus psychic damage is 17, plus 3d8 because he's undead. So 17 plus eight is 25, 29, 36 for the first attack. Fucking feathers, buddy. And then the second one is four, plus the Smite, and I get four plus eight is 12, 15, 22. Wait, I can only smite once per round? I'm also going to use my movement. Is there enough room to fly safely over big skeleton? Then I want to get into the back corner closest to Liam, on the map. Yeah. 120 feet of movement. Yeah. As far back from the enemies as I can be. That's good. Done. Y'all motherfuckers need Sarenrae. Well, you got a 20 on the last one. Well, we've all got to eat a little humble pie every once in a while. Even you. Wait, smite? I missed you. Shorthalt. Me up in the corner? It's what I do. Mother bitch! He's at the bottom? Sorry, honey. You're fine. Oh, you're dead. She can go wherever the fuck she wants. Matt Mercer in drag, shitting all over us. Two eights. Holy fuck. Back into the Skittle? Fuck you, Delilah. Holy shit! Come on, baby. And if you make it in, you're in a death box. Scanlan Shorthalt, killed by ROYGBIV. Congratulations. You're in a prison cell with Charles Manson. Hi, my name's Jeffrey Dahmer. Welcome to my Prismatic Sphere. Oh, I'm up? Lionel is right on that dark paladin, right? All right. I would like to use my movement to fly. It's probably not all of it, but 120 feet to get to his backside and stab him in the back. We'll start with that. That is a 19. All right, so that is sneak attack damage. He gets three plus eight is 11, plus... where the hell did my d8 go? Okay, 16 plus sneak attack damage. (counting) 45. So that guy took 45 in the back. Perfect. So that's movement, action, and what I have left is hasted action and bonus action, so I would like to use my bonus action to zip over to Pike, 120 feet. Yeah, and use my hasted action to carry her out of here, out where there's nobody. Towards the end of your map. That's 60 feet. That's great. I give her a bonus-bonus action to tousle her hair. Next. You're a fucking beast. Advantage, yeah. Yeah, motherfucker. (motorcycle revving) But we're way in the back. We'll have several problems if Keyleth dies. Do you have a giant crate of the things she can turn into? Sorry, Matt! And are the wings schlorped back in? I mean, she knows what she's doing. She knows how it works. We don't know why she's here, but she figured shit out the last time. If you lose your brain, you can't do it, so why not? Do I feel anything? Sense anything? From my patron. Yeah. Use my last Luck of the day. Same thing. It's shit. Seven. Yeah, that asshole. You've got five? Is the gate safe for us to travel? Suggestion. How did Ripley return-- That's what I meant to say. Delilah. Yeah. He didn't know the answer to the last one. So he might not know the answer. Is there anything that Delilah is afraid of? 1241?! Scanlan, Taryon. Wow. Real soon.
