'critrole'. The code is 'critrole'. Yes I will, I am very excited That's emblazoned on the inside of my mind. Wow! Wow. Oh, nothing. Wow. It's beautiful. Thank you. That's included. That's a good pitch. Hi, Sam. All this time you've been trying to kick my teeth in and your real enemy is right over here. And it was pale and icy, too, I think you were describing? 15. Did you get that in Yug'Voril? Yug'Voril. Is it from Yug'Voril? In Yug'Voril, at the bottom of that pit, when he headbutted the giant. Yeah! Ding! Click the Boots of Haste, and I want to go stealth, and scoot to that column past Grog, but closer to the worm. Not that one, the next one. Yeah. I think I can make it there. Do I need to roll stealth? I want to throw a dagger at it. Yeah. That is 28. I'll defer, but let me ask, going stealth and rolling a 28 on stealth, the footsteps were still enough to alert it to where I was? I didn't attack yet. No, it was a combined 28, just to go stealth. And I should have one attack. I should have an attack, right? Because I did the boots, I ran over here-- Two. Two, yeah. Two, because it was double the speed because of the boots. All right. First one is shit. That is 14. And the second one is-- I'm going to do Luck on that. The second one is 20. That's not a lot. But it is seven points of damage. First blood. First blood, everyone. 20? Can I use Evasion or no? Oh, with the boots on, 18. Yeah, I know. So tell me what happens. Oh, well, Uncanny Dodge. Right? Evasion is for spell effects-- That's okay. All right, so. Okay. Natural 20! Plus or minus? This is all happening in less than six seconds. I want to do an Evasion, that's an area effect! Yeah? All right. (laughs) Do I do the dex save first, or--? Oh, it's not an area effect? All right. Whatever you say. Natural 20. Evasion on dex save-- I've written an abbreviated version of this. It's area of effect, if it's like Fireball or anything that's in an area. Oh, but you're god, what do you want me to do? Wait, 40 or 20? Can I do Uncanny-- this is a new round, can I do Uncanny or not, yet? Shake that hangover off, Kiki. She just learned it yesterday! And I'm made of wind? I can begin to revert? So it's a minute-long process that I have to consciously decide, and I know this? I'm going to use disengage and I'm going to fart over towards my sister and Pike. Oh, then I'm going to dash towards my sister and Pike. Oh. Scanlan and Vex, sorry. I want to land and then start thinking, god, I wish I was not made of farts, and start trying to undo whatever this is. Dispel Magic, little man! I'm crouching! Fog of war, man. Everyone who's a cloud, we're floating back to Emon. Let's go. Let's solve the problem So to get out of this form, we have to stop and like meditate in one position for a full minute. What does it dissipate without doing that? How long does it take? Eight hours, good. Here comes the one. We still take damage in this form, right? She could be our saving grace. Let the man-- Keep your head in the game! Get it. Get it, girl, get it. And I can't remember, Evasion has nothing to do with this? Okay, I'm going to use Luck. My last Luck. That's not good. So constitution save? Seven. Why don't we let him say what he was going to say? Okay. I look around really fast, run up to my sister, give her a giant hug, and (magic sound) Dimension Door over to where Grog is. Oh, it's so far, it's like 500 feet I believe. I'll find it. I'm hasted; do I have one or two attacks at this point? One attack? Okay. Action. Okay. Well then, I'm going to throw a dagger at the back of the frost one. It's 60 feet, Sharpshooter, no disadvantage. I had armor and I gave it to someone, I don't have it anymore. All right. I want to see if I can use the haste to do double distance to get behind Pike in that little alcove. If I can't go that far, I'll use dash to get behind her. Without the dash? I'm standing right behind her and I say, Pike, I'm a little banged up. Dagger, dagger, dagger. 17 for the first. 21 for the second. 18 for the third. All right, so first one is four. This is doubled, so that's 15 plus... 16, 21, 25, 28, 36 for the first. Second one is nine, and the third one is ten. Done. Question! Pike probably doesn't, but do I have any advantage being that I'm in this little closed-in bubble? Of course that hits. Still hits! Uncanny Dodge please! To halve the damage. Unconscious. 21 halved? Oh, yeah. Okay, no, I'm still on my feet. (dazed mumbling) Hold on. 16. Still conscious. (muffled) I'm still in here. (muffled) I'm in acid in here. Hits! I mean, I'm unconscious. Unconscious-- I'm unconscious. Huh? Oh, yeah. And I clap my hand here and I leave a big, gory, slimy smear right on the half of her face. Thank you, Pike. Shh! I speak quietly into the earring and say could everybody shut the fuck up, please, and can we get out of here? Quietly? Yeah, let's call another two worms, let's do that. They fucking hated each other. They hated each other! I'm meeting Trinket, and I'm going to lay-slash-nap on his back. 20. Anything left? Or is it just where I, we-- There were traps left still. Still the same, all right. We've probably earned a bit of trust at this point. That thing is trouble, though, that thing is trouble I start running after him, and I'm hasted. I'm running out stealthing, after him. Says who? Who's in there? I want to walk right up to Grog. Right up to his nipples, because that's as high as I go. That's two episodes from today. Will you come down here, please? Big Man? Couple of things. First, and this is a smaller detail, I shaved half your beard, correct? It's correct. You've cut me open at least twice, right now. Pike, come here. I would say that makes you and I even. You've been acting all kinds of fucked-up for a while now, and I know you don't want to disappoint her, your best friend. Something's going on with you, and it's time to talk about it. You're talking to yourself, you're talking to your own asshole. You're talking to that fucking sword, you're talking to trinkets we're picking up in houses. What is going on? And she's listening. And she knows when you're lying, and she knows when you're telling the truth. I walk away. I walk off. I leave the fucking house. Gone. Stealthed. Laters. Do you need a scroll? Surprise! Matt's got to be using Botox, because he didn't move! (laughter) No, I'm not. Nope. (laughs) Well-remembered. There was another 20 or 30g there. Probably. Marisha has a high clout score. Cold as ice. I'd also like to point out that Grog's single nut-flick did more damage than your two full-on punches. (laughter) Probably should check the silverware, though, in the keep. And where would it have been hidden on their person? It's just radioactive material in the basement. It's fine. I mean, I'm assuming-- I didn't go there to find anything, but I went just to think, and I didn't see anything by chance, no? All right, well, I guess I'll go back to the keep. And I will sit up. No one's there? I'll sit up in my sister's room. Stealth, please. I'm not walking in the open. 27. Not now, Kiki. And I just keep going. Look, everything's fine. All right? Everything's fine. I just don't know what we're doing, anymore. I don't know what we're doing, I don't know why we're doing it. I don't know! I've just been thinking about it, I mean, what is the point of our lives? Yeah. It's fine, let's go. I don't know what I missed. I can go wherever everybody wants to go. No. When it was just you and me, I knew what we were doing. We were just trying to survive. (sighs) We're running into this shit on purpose now. Which is all right, when there's reason. I don't always know why we're doing the things we do. It was fun, breaking into that house. I'm good at it! I don't know why we did it! I don't know why I'm working with a large fucking beast of a man who seems to despise me. Day after day. The fuck he doesn't. I don't know why we're doing it. I don't know why we're with most of these people! And I love these people, but I don't know why we're doing it! And I just want you to think about a little bit too. And I walk out the door. I'm going through my vast array of cloaks. (laughter) Fecal matters. He's currently like this. 15 again. Chickens come home to roost. 14. That's enough for all of us. I click my boots, and I-- Shit, where is everybody? I yank Trinket by the fur on his butt and say, come on Trinket! And then start running backwards and grabbing at my sister's cloak as I go towards Keyleth. Matt, probably too late, but can I retcon-- say I'm holding my attack, since I didn't do anything? Fine if not, I just thought-- If it bears down on us. I'm not going to leave the group, I'm going to pace with them. Thought we were going to be starting a brand-new Shadowrun campaign next week! That was frightening, man.
