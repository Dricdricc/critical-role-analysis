(frustrated noises) So some of you might remember us talking about Joe Madureira and his Kickstarter game, Darksiders Night War, which he successfully Kickstarted. We talked about it a bunch on this show-- Hm? Excuse me. Battle Chasers. Excuse me, I was going to be here for a half hour and settle down and go over my talking points. Battle Chasers. I'm wearing the damn shirt. (laughter) Pitbull Chasers, Flo Rida, and Joe collaborating together. Anyway, that game's coming out. You should check it out, this is it. But I bring that up because while Joe is a busy, busy guy, he somehow found the time-- I'm so excited-- to create an exclusive art piece for Critical Role. Look at that business. So right now-- Guys, if you go over to the Geek and Sundry shop right now, this is on pre-order, so-- I'm going over my script-- signed versions of this will be available for pre-order for 2 weeks only. 2-week pre-order. And then unsigned for 3 weeks. So this is now or never. And it's too gorgeous, too. Oh my lord. It's all right. Vex is on the paper, so. They're 24 x 36. Gorgeous. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, there's a button for that. Thank you, Joe. Thank you. It's gorgeous. LAURA AND And Battle Chasers Night War. You should check it out today. (laughter) Us. By us. I need to go to the temple of the Raven Queen. I know that you all have a lot of errands to do. I don't need everyone to come. I thought so. You mentioned... (sighs) We've not been here many times. Are we surrounded by people? Are there people walking about? That makes sense. Thought so. (laughter) I was just eating an apple. Why am I dying? How are the people doing? Is there a sense of worry, or do you guys feel pretty secure? And her husband Merkin. We needn't stay here long. I don't think what I'm here for is going to take too long. I hope. We could go to Whitestone next. I'm sure they smell like Grog. Sulfuric? Yeah, we could. I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything! Another tattoo? It is. I'm getting a tattoo. It will say "Phillip the Brave". Across the small of my back. (slowly) I don't know. Thank you. Is there anything left inside of this? That's wonderful. All right, Percival. You know. Enough chit-chat. Let's get this shit done. MATT AND You have to build him a hand. First question. The whole walk over, I've been talking a lot, mostly to Trinket. You know, scratching him behind the ears, saying, "Buddy, you've been trapped in there a while. "It's good to see you out." Come hug your uncle. Come. I'm sure he doesn't. I'm just happy to see him. Yeah. It's cold. You're sure you don't want to go back in? Nah, you don't want to go back in. I know. Just nervous talking the whole way there. I'm all right. I'm just going to talk to my sister for a minute. You know, I know you want to-- I know you. I know you want to be here. I don't. I really don't. Listen to me. You did not put me in this place. No one put me in this place. And I tug her sleeves and make them a little more orderly and I move a bit of hair out of her face and I do a button that's not done. Everything's going to be fine. That's all right. Just wait here I'll be out in a bit, all right? Everything's fine. Yeah. I'm not. I know. I'll see you-- You know I love you, too. You're going to wait here for me, right? And then I drop the smile as I walk off towards the other two. Were you expecting me? All right. I've brought a couple of friends. Is that permissible here? They'll keep quiet. Guys. Noticing that, I turn and just sort of look at my sister for 5 or 10 more seconds. (hesitantly) Let's do this. Oh dear, oh my. I've come to understand my place in Her sight. Right. Just cross your fingers for me, okay? I made my bed. Now I gotta lie in it. I'll see you soon. I follow. I have come to pay a debt, and I do so gladly and without question. What would you have of me? I walk slow and straight in. I keep going. I open my mouth and inhale. This was always supposed to happen, wasn't it? (haltingly) I give myself willingly to you for the bargain that was struck, although I question if the bargain was just the surface reason for this to happen. I would learn your ways. I will learn your purpose. And I will serve. (whispering) I do. I take it. (hoarsely) I got answers in there, but they led to more questions. What am I to do with those questions? I do. Thank you. I'm shell-shocked. It's going to be good. (whispering) Yeah. Do you speak? To her? Do you understand? Yeah. Yeah. I do. I don't know what... I don't know why, but... this was fate. No. I know it here. Everything has led to it. You and I wouldn't be standing here if my sister hadn't stolen a broom. Where's the sense in that? What else is it? I teleported into the stomach of a dragon with a gnome and I am still standing here. If it is not fate, what is it? This is real. This was meant to be. And I am on board. (disbelieving laughter) It is not what I wanted. Thank you. Thank you. I need to see my sister. And I head off towards the exit. It was really weird, but it's fine. I told you I'd be fine, and I'm fine. (laughs) Yeah, doesn't make any sense, does it. I think I might be a bit weaker, actually. I have the jelly-legs. Could I? He's going to get sticky. No, don't lick. Don't lick. But don't lick, Trink, please. Later, buddy. Later. I give a quick look back at my friends. and then I take a nap on Trinket. (snores) That is the very ceiling of intelligence of his. Wow. Wow. Is this your variant fighting costume? Doesn't matter. (laughs) Vax has been laughing hysterically, giggle fits, clutching his ribs the entire time. And then is there any of the staff here? Anyone that's here? Anyone else? What about underlings? Yeah, yeah, come here, you. Do you have a tub? Do you have a bath? Look at me. Do you have a bath? I need a bath. Yeah? Is it hot? I feel like I need it to be hot. Okay. That's perfect, thank you. Grog, put that hat on again. (laughs hysterically) Somewhere deep in the building, far away Percy's gun! (laughter) Do it! Do it! Pretty good song. (hums Black Hole Sun) (laughs) Is it like Young Frankenstein? (mechanical sound effects) A fighter is born. (clears throat) Ring-a-ding-ding. Said the T. rex. Are we next morning, or we're still evening, at this point? Thanks, man. You're in the tubby town, though. Sorry, Taliesin. Rolled high. It's a page-turner. And please go check out the Joe Mad poster. Also check out Battle Chasers Night War. It's a beautiful-looking game. I played it today. What do we need to accomplish here in town? Is there anything we need to finish, or do we want to pick our next destination? Not a good idea, Grog. And you put us in a safe spot somewhere in there, somehow? Have we been there before? I don't know. No, not normally. I know, but you're saying we've been there, but they just did that recently. Do the two of us know enough that were you to jump from the same place here, would you necessarily end up in the same spot in the Feywild? We don't know. All right. Loot Crate. Check out Loot Crate. Refresh it. Quit the program and go back in. Tell them to quit and re-login. Whoa, we were in the Feywild for a second there. Dragons are dead. But I also think we've earned more than a single day of rest. Let's go to Whitestone. (sneezes) TALIESIN AND Come on, man. Snitch. Whitestone. It's cheeky. That helmet is really something else. That's technically true, yes. Let's go to Whitestone. So handsome. Swabby. I am trying to find Shaun Gilmore. Sure, come on. Let's start asking around town for him. You heard right. Thank you. I'm not terribly familiar with Whitestone, could you point us in the right direction? The castle. Can't miss that. Let's go. All right, yeah. Let's do it. But in two or three weeks, it's not bad. You're looking well. Oh, hey, you. I pat him on the ribs. It's fantastic to see you. You're a sight for sore eyes, yourself. We're very happy to see you. Yeah. Hard life. On the way out, as we're all walking out, I walk along with Gilmore and I give him just a gentle shoulder. Shoulder to shoulder. And say, "It's really good to see you on your feet. "It's the best smile I've had in ages." (cracks up) I'm dressed, yeah. E3, y'all. You ought to let her try that helmet on later. Or is it? Don't know? Is it that you have no idea what happened to things put through? Do you know anything about the Vestige itself? He's reshaping the land as he sees fit. Every one of them, one after the other. Do we know where Vorugal has taken up roost? No one knows? Good night, Shaun. What do you say we go get you a new bow? Nah. Let's get you a bow. That's a shitty idea. Want to play hacky sack? What are you doing? Yeah, I took a bath. Don't I look all right? I'm fine! What's your problem? Yeah. Yeah. It's all gone. I'm doing much better. Much better. You ready for the Feywild? Oh. You've had opium this whole time and you never... That was super awesome and I can't wait to see the outcome, but before that happens, I was standing right here when these two walked off, so I am waiting in the exact same spot for my sister to return. It's fine. I will. I took a little bit of a nap. Yeah. You're a grown-ass woman, and you're twice as strong as I am. So your business is your business. Just... both eyes open, yeah? Don't do that to me. Please don't ever do that to me again. And if you do, you will never use that wink on me again. It is not for me. Just... he's charming, but both eyes open, please. Yeah, the fuck you don't. I'm going to go to my room now and see if I splat on the floor. Sorry, buddy, it's a 31. How thick is it? Is it viscous? Put my hand in it. Does that stay? Goes away. All right. Okay. I'm going to scrape a bunch of it up just into my hand, so I have a big handful of it, and I'm just going to go to Grog's room, and I'm going to slowly, just at the door, take time to write, Grog smells like farts and-- I picked specifically small words! (laughter) And I draw-- No. I'll tell you what I do. Pull down my breeches and I put the oil on my butt and I go (squelch). (laughter) Get busy living or get busy dying. Butt-print. Yes? It's all right. I open it up. (quietly) Give me a minute. (louder) There's a wooden screen in the room. I go behind it and wipe any oil left off my butt. (laughter) Everything looks all right. And I put it on. Take it. Can I make an insight check? Oh, that's my specialty. Constitution save? 11. I'll use luck. 18. That fucked with my head, Matt. This one did die! I slit its throat, yeah. It's all right. Yes, I did. Yeah, I cut his throat. He threatened my family and I said, "Say something about my sister again," and I slit his throat. Whoo. There were two Loot Crates, one-- Thanks, Joe Madureira, for the art!
