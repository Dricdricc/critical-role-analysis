Like Critical Role urns to hold the ashes of your friends! It's me. I have enough nervous energy to power the US Navy right now. While that conversation was happening, I tug Keyleth back and the wings flex out and around in a bit of a shell around us. Quickly. Forever and ever and always. I steal what I assume is my last kiss. Let's go. All saves. She's all growed up. 24. Where's Vex now? She's over there? I'm going to go to the side of this glowy thing. Can I get there? Can I get any farther with my wings out? I popped them out before we came up. No, I wanted to hover like five feet above-- Before he started, that was Optimus Prime. (laughter) Thanks Gil. 22. It's like a chime. We get advantage on saves from Pike's spell. Is Grog within ten feet of me? Then you get plus two from me. d4, that's right. 30. And evasion evades all of that? Do I, with the evasion? Break. To split asunder. Worst Carvel cake ever! If I'm airborne, do I make the same strength saving throw? He's so happy though, now that his hand is back. Let me tell you. You sick bastard, Matt, I love you so much. Slash hate you. I mean I did just kill your daughter. She was brought back, but I did kill her. 1d6, bitch! He's dead. Is this your #blessed? Hey now, this is our first god we're fighting. Click the boots. What I'd like to do is fly within ten feet of him. To do that, how far am I flying? I have 120 feet of movement, wings out, hasted. Spending 45 feet to get there? Once I'm in ten feet, as a bonus action I cast Vow of Enmity on him. To start. I have no idea if I'm in range? It doesn't seem like I'm in range, but I don't know. But that's within ten feet of him? Just in case, I'm going to use my hasted action to disengage and fly away from him-- no! I'm going to use my regular action to attack twice as a paladin. At advantage, first one (groans), I'm going to use-- Right, plus four. Hold on, where did my four go? Someone give me a four! I don't know where my own four went. It's going to be plus one. I already did that. It's going to be a 24 on that, to hit. Hits! I'll roll for the second attack as well. Which is a 25. The first one is Whisper and it does (counting). Oh, shit! I wanted to throw it at the tome. Does that change anything? Never mind. 19. Can I reroll the second attack? Nah! Forget it. (counting) 44 for the first attack. Okay, and the second attack is nine. And I will dump poison into it, which is stupid, but I'm going to do it anyway! He's the only one here. He has to make a DC 15. Come on, big guy! After my two paladin attacks I'm going to-- Nine. Then I'll use my hasted action to disengage just in case he can curb stomp me and I want to fly to here and hover ten feet above that chunk of cake. Just remember I'm floating. Can we hit the table like we're tilting a pinball machine, and knock him off? Fuck you, Vecna! She's off the side, yeah? Save yourself now so you can do something in 15 seconds. See you, Trink. Prepped for the future and forgot to do what I wanted to do. You've got it made. You're safe. It's 40, isn't it? Hold onto your butts. 1d4 from Bless. Bigby, make a sleight of hand check. Permanent Jenga. Oh boy. I move faster. I'm right after you. Your call. Can I get within-- yeah, I definitely can. I'm going to fly up and get within 50 feet of this dick. That's fine, but I have Vow of Enmity so I have permanent advantage at the moment. Yeah, okay. So I'm going to-- I'm within 60 feet. I'm going to try to throw at the tome in his hand and I'm going to dagger, dagger, dagger, dagger. So first one. First one is a 32. No it's not, it's a 33. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. 28. So this is sneak attack damage on the book. Okay. So that's two plus eight is ten. That is 36 for the first attack on the book. I will now start unloading into his body. That's a 17 which doesn't hit. Does not hit. Third attack is 20-- oh wait, what did I say last? 17, 18? 19. Doesn't hit. Next one is 29. Okay. And this is just him. 17 for that. And the last dagger does 25. Yep. And that is a measly little four. So that was action, action, action, four. And that's it. I don't know what the total was. I was after the book. And I use my full movement to get where I am right now? 120 feet. So then I will go to the piece of cake that Percy's on in the dark portion, but again ten feet flying above. Mm-hmm. Waiting to dive after Velora. Didn't have anything ready. It was cocked. With the d4? All you need is one. Can I sacrifice one of my lucks as tribute? I am sweating all over. Prayers are answered. But he has 17. Intelligence and he's hexed? And it looks like he's above stone? Go fishing for Grog. But gloriously. Giant eagle is 80 feet. (screeches) It's beautiful. His bone-dry anus? Yes. Big money. This is the holy light swirling in a ball before it takes off. Hashtag blessed. 31. If anybody survives. Goddamn it. With my hasted action, I will cast Lay on Hands on Scanlan and bring him back up. He's got the book, right? Am I within 120 feet of Vecna's face? I'm going to latch onto Vecna's face. I'm going to fly straight at his face. That's all my movement to get there? On his face. I'm flying right in his face. I will use paladin action to dagger-dagger him in the face. Hasted action. That's fine, so I use my regular action to Lay on Hands, and my hasted action to attack him once in the face, maybe more, we'll see. I'm going to use my first luck of the night. Bad rolls. 24. Up top! And I'm going to dump 2nd-level Smite. Yeah he is, motherfucker. I need to write this down before I forget it. So before the Smite, it's 44. And Jesus, I'm forgetting everything. 2d8 plus additional for undead which is 12, so 56, and how much extra for the undead, I can't remember. 1d8? 2d8? Seven. TRAVIS and Bonus action, I will whisper to him No fear. And stick one last dagger in his face. Oh, do I? That's fine, that hits, that's 36. Yes I do with Whisper, but it's not Whisper. Wait. So it is a crit? It's nothing though, the damage is nothing but he does have to roll a save, he'll be fine, or be afraid of me. Six big points, six big points. Wait that's Whisper, plus-- 14 big points. 22 points, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I usually throw daggers, I usually don't get up on people. Yes. Buy me a beer. Uh-huh. Here it is. Okay. I'm above 100. So I have no idea if that has anything to do with what's going on here. I'm going to use Luck. It was a good roll, but I'm going to use Luck. SAM. Yeah. No. Con save? 24. I've got the necrotic armor on. Okay. That's fair. Ah! This guy! (yelling) Could you aim for his penis? And you're on that side. We love you, Ashley. Yeah. Question. I'm probably out of range. Am I in or out of range, by his face? Probably just out? Close to Pike-- am I 60 feet? Does she get to choose? Vax is doing real well. The temporary hit points don't come back, right? Yeah, Vax is doing real well. I'll take a skosh, a peppering. She can see how fucked up we are. None of the temporary hit points, but your regular max. Love your healers, folks. Are you thinking of blessing Grog and Keyleth, or something like that? The face Ashley just made! Did you just kill our guests? You're a monster! Oh yeah, okay, sneak attack. On my advantage, because of Vow of Enmity. I have been tweeted at by eight billion people saying that on attack of opportunity on a reaction, I get sneak attack. Thanks, eight billion people! I rolled a 34 to hit, so I'm going to start rolling damage. And I'll dump Smite into it, as well. I didn't do any damage yet. (adding) Good. I'm calculating shit. I'm scared to death. Well I just hit him for a total, with Smite, for a total of 65. They're going to splat. For holding Zahra and Kash, and the monsters? Because I stabbed him in the face? Or in the ass as he ran. Dex save, right? Dex save, yeah. You're blessed, so add a d4. 34. Okay, so with a split second and that erupted all around us, I have a moment to appreciate all of this angelic fucking flexing and taking all of that damage. I take out my superior healing potion, kiss Keyleth on the cheek, and feed her the potion. That's my action, my regular action. Then I'm flying eye-level with Vecna. Yeah, am I within 60 feet there? I'll get a little bit closer, and then I will use my hasted action to chuck a dagger at his fucking face. Yeah. Natural 20 with Whisper. (counting) 64, plus the psychic. 69 with Whisper. And I will bamf there. I do, but it's weak. I'll use my last bonus action to stab again. With Whisper. 28. To hit. (counting) 20. 129. Oh no! Oh, death saves, handing out death saves. They're getting ready to do the finishing move on him. Take him out, and then stab him while he's down. Vox Machina, This. Is. Your Life! 26! You've said that like 17 times. Screams of thousands? You're carrying the football, man. Once a year, I can do that. It takes a year to rest. How excited we were. Not in my experience. But you still get to fuck him up. Natural 20 plus eight, so 28. I used luck to get it. 41. Do you like it? We've dropped a lot of damage, as well. Wait, what's the total for me? Nine, ten, and 11 all to me? Okay. Every time we hit him. I'm at 78. Yeah. 26. Don't worry about it. Question for the I pull out the trammel. Do you have a free hand? Or a belt? Yeah, you've got a belt. So no free hand. Can I use the hasted action to shove my trammel into his belt? Or anywhere? The Raven Queen's trammel. I did a perception check and got a 28. Yeah. And then I'm going to-- (sighs) fuck, I'm going to get in his face again and use paladin attack-attack. That's 29 to hit, the first. Keep him hurting. (counting) 33 for the first attack. Second attack is a 21, so I think that misses. And then I've got a bonus action left. I'm going to stay where I am, and I have a regular healing potion. I'm going to down that. That's 4d4 plus four, right? We are picking his scabs. I'd like to point out that we have two barbarians and two paladins up here right now. One of my die? I feel like my luck is tied up with the existence of the world, so could I give her one of my lucks? She barely even gave that shit to me. Keep going! You can hold it out to him. That's key. That's great. It'll buff you a little bit on your strength check. d4 on a skill check. Oh shit. Now I am the master. Mass Cure Wounds. Getting each other ready. Where's Pike? Do I in my knowledge in having watched this crazy motherfucker with Polymorph know if striking him and taking away his little bit of life, he poofs back, right? Okay, so bonus action to disengage from Vecnards, and I'm going to fly at that fox, and I am going to strike him with the flame tongue dagger. (cheering) Thankfully, it's not sneak attack, but I rolled a natural 20 and rolled a one, so the dice get doubled to two, plus my modifier of six on the flame tongue is eight, so he gets hit for eight hit points of damage. Do I see a gnome or a fox? It's a fox. It's like a cat or a dog. It's nothing. It was eight total. And we'll call that my hasted action, and with my regular action, I will put my hands on the side of Ioun's chosen and use Lay on Hands to give him 20 hit points back, and then I will use the rest of my movement to fly back into Vecna's fucking face. And I have no attacks left, but I'll stay there. Jenga! Removing resistance? Back in the game! He's the most important. I'm not important. Hold for Pike. This is the giant dragon punch. We saw in the past. No, fuck you. I love that we are working on miniatures at the table. Oh, it's very calming, working on minis. On his utility belt. Yeah, we've been hurting him pretty bad. The Ark reactor. Does reaction work like attack of opportunity? To keep him here? Yeah. He's running away. Oh. Yeah. That's our Grog. It's Reading Rainbow time. I'm going to use a bonus action to look over my shoulder and see everyone that I know. I'm going to see my sister and her husband. I'm going to see the woman that I love. I'm going to see Grog. I'm going to see Arkhan. I'm going to see my friend Scanlan. And then I'm going to dig into Vecna's eye and stab away. It's too late. No? I will use it to grapple. Should I reroll? Two rolls here, unused. That is a 22. All right. That was my-- (clattering over Skype) (laughter) That was my hasted action. I'm going to stay here and fucking hug Vecna's face. Trained in arcana? Oh my god. Burt Reynolds, do it. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Okay. I would like to cast Compelled Duel on Vecna. It's a long shot, but I'm going to do it. One creature that you can see within range must make a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. So I would like to do it. Sure. Okay. So that didn't work. For my action, I would like to steal a bonus kiss from Keyleth of the Air Ashari. Every different form-- male, female, big, tall, small, whatever-- I'm in love. And I would like to use my regular action to fly in front of Scanlan Shorthalt, five feet in front of him, and splay my wings as wide as they can and flip the double birds to the biggest dick on the fucking planet. In front of Scanlan. Good. That hits. I'll use uncanny dodge to reduce it to half. Yes. I grab Scanlan like a football for old times' sake and I come up behind Keyleth and I kiss her on the cheek and stare forward. See you in the next campaign, motherfucker! Power move! Lucky and smart. I didn't use two of my luck. I saved them! Real bad. We would have had to have done five more games for this thing to end. Sam. You were trying to save a Wish for me? Yeah. I get to play the first two minutes of the game. LAURA and Love you. We're so glad you were here from the start of the game, Ash!
