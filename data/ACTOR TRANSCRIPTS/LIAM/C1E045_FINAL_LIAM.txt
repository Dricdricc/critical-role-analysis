Is that how it works? You still can die from them, though, just to be clear. It's appropriately called a "die." Yeah? Sure, I could talk about a couple of things. Hey, a quick shout-out for our neighbor, Ivan van Norman's Kickstarter, The ABCs of RPGs, has three days left. I backed it immediately, because I like D&D and I have kids, and you put those two things together and good things happen. So that's good, three days left. Also, hey, if you like to put your dice in boxes, I tell you what. Wyrmwood Gaming make beautiful boxes, and if you go over to their site and you use the code critrole. There it is. You get free shipping, they're beautiful, they have all different kinds of woods to put your dice inside. Is there anything else? Oh, yeah! Oh, okay. Yeah, hey, some of us, not all of us, are going to be going up to San Fran later this month to make appearances on GameSpot's show The Lobby for a couple of segments, and then, also then hopping over to hang with the guys at Kinda Funny to play D&D. And I'm curious to see, because there's going to be two DMs, in sort of a Batman and Robin-type relationship kind of thing? Travis and I are wearing green snake shirts, because (Irish accent) Saint Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland, into Burbank. (Irish accent) It's fucking Irish wool! Shit. Help. Help. Help. Help. You should be. What? What? It's acid-resistant. Whatever you want, Vex'ahlia. The same could be said about your new pajamas. I think Percy is right that we should let it out now because it's a question mark, no matter what. Whatever, it's all theories. We don't know what we're getting into, and better that it pop out now, on its own, and not while we're facing a fucking beholder. Percival. Are there any libraries here? What about a personal collection in your family? Goodberries? Sure, yes, yes, yes, Keyleth had a good idea, yes. I thought we rested before we went down under the water, though-- I don't remember resting afterwards. And I was there. What're you talking about? That killed my sister. What do you mean? Well, what happened, Percival? You just opened it? Just like that? All right. Could you do me a favor? In the future-- If there is anything that your little heart desires inside of a box-- In the future, could you check with my sister or myself first? Well-- Well listen, Percy. We are not playing a game. And we will all make mistakes, and I wager I will make my fair share. I've little doubt. And Percival, I want to apologize. I'm sorry. But-- And I punch him in his know-it-all fucking mouth. Goodnight, Percival. (Grog voice) Go fish. Keep in mind how confined it is, okay? And go. (laughter) That's more than the price of a book. Wait 'til it's quiet. And I leave the room that I've been given at Whitestone. And I find my sister's door. And I stand outside it, and I stare at it for a minute-- And I stealth away. 25. And I wait for the door to close. And then I walk to Keyleth's door. And I knock. I don't know. I go in. I don't know. All I know is... that I felt her. I don't know magic, I don't know anything. I open doors, and only when the wind is blowing in the right direction, sometimes, I think. I don't know what happened, but I felt her. 22. Yeah. I don't know if I did anything in there, and I wouldn't take it back if I did, but I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know anything about any of that. I'll let you. Keyleth, I love you. I quickly leave her room. Go water elemental. Sorry, just one detail. From there, I went and fell asleep in this idiot's doorway. Matt, shit on my face. All they heard was "ace." I'm awake. Hi. Yeah. Sorry, I couldn't find my room. What time's it? Come here, you shithead. Don't fucking do that again. Don't fucking do that again, all right? Just don't fucking do it again. Fuck. You'll live, you'll live. Jesus. Whoever that is. Is there any coffee in this fucking castle? That's random. All right. I don't want it. I'll give you the leather armor after I have a chance to change. (softly) I know. I know. Yeah. I'm just looking at it in the hallway. Still pretty tired, to be honest. Didn't sleep a lot in the doorway. I just took it for fashion purposes, I suppose. Yeah. I'm going to walk off with this shit. (sings) Into the woods! (singing) Anything can happen in the woods. No. We're not having this conversation. And is it three-two-one, three-two-one-do it, or three-two-one and go, That's not a bad idea, you get controlled by things. Maybe you could wait just a little bit further back? That's a big if. Yeah! We won't shut the door, I just want you outside of any potential blast radius. Yes, we're going to hide. (laughs) She swatted me and said, 'Put your armor on,' so I'm doing it. 15 minutes! Well, guess I'm doing it. No, I get that, I get that, I would've guessed two minutes. You should yell out, 'I'm stealthing'. (whispering) Ow ow ow! That's too tight! I click my Boots of Haste! I still walk toward the wolf. No no no, I did the top, I did the top, c'mon! And I kneel. And bow my head. Keyleth? Tell him to come forward and look into my eyes. Tell him. As it's coming, I'm taking daggers out and throwing 'em on the ground. Where did we get that? Gray Chicken McNuggets. Forget the chocolate. We have Dork! We've got nothing of Dork left? I'm peeling that off as we walk. LAURA and I'm peeling it off. I'm peeling it off. I have regular fucking armor that I grew up in with you, you fucking shit. You're a funny man. Oh, you soured the DM. (laughter) Yes. Trinkachu, I choose you. That's two of us. I do. As we're walking through town, do I see any weaponsmiths? Okay. 21. And one's nearby, to pass through? I'm splitting off from the group. One's in front of me now? Excuse me, sorry to interrupt, I have a very simple request. I have six gold burning a hole in my pocket. I'm not looking for anything simple. Do you have a short sword? A regular old shortsword. What's the difference between the two that I can see? 22. I grab one off the wall. I slap down six gold, which I know is way too much and say, thank you sir. Pelor lives here. And I walk away. Yeah? Oh, I'm sorry. How much does it cost? My apologies. 12? So I put down six. I put down another 14. I really apologize. I was just confused. I walk down the street going like-- it's big. I don't need your dagger. Wise as fuck. Heroes' Breakfast. Hey, de Rolo, do you remember what happened yesterday? Where did I go? Oh, I went to buy a shortsword. I'd like to think you hear me in your mind. Fuck! We all miss Pike. That's a good idea, for you to not cook breakfast. Wait! While they're sleeping, right-- I take Scanlan aside. Hey, buddy. Yeah. We don't talk a lot. I don't handle personal emotional confrontation very well. Where did you go? Pull up a chair, sit down, I want to ask you something. You're right. How do you do it? How do you do it? You're risking your life as much as anyone in this group, you're almost dying every day. You're fucking smiling all the time. How do you do it? I'm kind of asking as Liam to Sam as well, but mostly as Vax to Scanlan. How do you do it? You almost died yesterday as well. Or two days ago, fuck. Why do you do it? Yeah. We're probably going to die in the next month. All right. Thought I might-- Yeah, but I'm just as confused as before. How much older? You did that. Water under the bridge. That little motherfucker shit in my bed. Try it out. 35. As we travel, because I was too out of it to respond and she's way ahead, I take the potion that Keyleth gave to me, because she didn't have to, I've got the David Bowie armor on now. Yes, yeah. Before going to bed. And I press it into Vex's hand. Come on, Colville meteorite die. I'm so weak. Natural 20! Thank you, Matthew Colville. What's the matter? Yeah, I'm breaking out of stealth and running. Halves. Thanks for tuning in to Therapy Thursday, everyone. I'm super busy, I'm super busy. I'll help save the world, but I got like 50 things on my schedule. We love you, but I need to sleep. It's as simple as that. We love you, and we love Critmas, but it's a health thing. 1237. For fuck's sake, take an Uber.
