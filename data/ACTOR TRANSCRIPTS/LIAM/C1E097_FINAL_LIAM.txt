Well, I've probably got about 30 or 40 minutes left on the-- Do that. Yeah? I can go swimming. Your thing? Or your friend Keyleth. It was nice being in a couple. I am having the best conversation with JB right now. Okay. I am starting to sweat! Who sees it? I don't see it! It was like a magic trick! It was like a fish turned into a corpse! I'm not angry! What the shit is this show? Vax is sitting with JB right now, going like, so what was Pike like when she was really little, little for a gnome? I was really paying attention to JB, though. Yeah! Because she's got a wild streak. Now, does that run in the family, or is that just her and you? What? You-- What? I'm casting Lay on Hands for my piddly 20 hit points. What did you do? Did you die?! She looks like a fucking macabre mess! What happened?! That's what alcohol is for! Don't jump off cliffs anymore, please! And I turn her bloody face to you and say, let this be a lesson to you, then! I start kissing the gory mess in my hands all over her forehead. We should celebrate because we've broken in the entire group. JB. Welcome to the family. I got this! Make-believe has consequences. Is 15 hours of that therapy? We all stand for something. What do you fall for? Oh, so good. Investigation, yeah? 18. This has been a bad couple of days. Well, you weren't a proper adventurer until you were. Got to start somewhere. (cell phone ringing) Oh dear. No, you didn't get a read. Oh, it's too hazy. I can't see him. It's dried in the hair, though, and caked in. Give the woman a job. Keep her busy. LAURA and All right. Sure. Right, best of intentions, yeah. I feel you. Matt has burned us too many times. We just got swindled yesterday. I'm going to be real shitty and stealth up and peek in and see what she's up to. We'll find out won't we. 33 for stealth. Yeah. Natural 20. I want to insight check and just get as good a read on her emotional state as I can, even though she's got a thousand-yard stare. This is insight? I'll use Luck. Better. Sure, why not? What am I saving it for? 18. Into the earring I say We are terrible, terrible assholes. She seems fine. She seems worthy of a baking job. You know, work with her for a day, but I'm not seeing anything hinky here. Yeah? You need anything else? Because I'm staring at a woman crying into her satchel. My significant other just mangled herself. I need to keep busy. Let's go see Yennen. And so I lead her off. Sorry. Sorry. You don't know anything about Orcus, do you? Didn't think so. We should leave. Come on. Surprise. So much. That's what she's doing tonight. I don't think that's what she does every day. Did I see more than one room, or was it a single-room home? Of cakes? That's pronounced boysness. Grog got down to boysness and ended a fool's life. Sharpshooter? Wouldn't that nullify that? Three-quarter cover means nothing. It's just full cover. Yeah, both were high teens. He's telling her real stuff, man. Vex dies. Well first I drag Keyleth off to the cozy little bathtubs that they have here in the castle and took the opportunity-- they're quite small, actually. And washed all of the caked-in, the last of the caked-in blood and everything. No, that really happened. That actually happened yesterday. Congratulations! You got a little bit of sleep stuff still in your eye. Yeah, that's better. Sam... He's sleeping in, isn't he? Where are you? No, they're at Vex's house. Sam, why don't you just tell us where you are? I tag along. I want to a take a look at that and see if it looks like a trap, and I don't understand magic, but if it is similar to any trigger mechanisms that I've seen. 31. Do you think this thing is looking at us? This little bead? Yeah, I don't think it's trapped or anything. You probably can do that. Looks like the bead shut him down. Did you see Tary-town? Was she a drow? Yeah, he is daddy's boy. Well. It's irrelevant, though. We've got to go get him. LAURA and A Tree Stride spell traveling. Yeah. That's a lot of ifs, though. 22. No, 24. All right. It's not locked anymore. 32. One more in here. Is there any bullshit hiding around in here? 29. All right, Whisper out, and I cut her free. You all right? What happened? And you've met us before? No? That's good. That's also pretty good. Yeah. What's our fastest method there? Gilmore's been many places. He might have something from there. Two days. Go to Emon, talk to Shaun. He's been everywhere. Don't do it. The last time we came here, we came flying out of a tree on an angle. Before we do. Percy, do you know anything about this country we're in? Anything? Also, we can't talk when we're farts, so when we get there, what's the plan, plan man? What happens if we don't see the person on the horse? What happens? We just land right outside the gates and ring the bell? Okay, but that seems a little dicey if we want to work out what we're going to do. We're just going to appear and say howdy? You and Tary are thick as thieves, now. How plugged in is his dad? Yes, Maryanne Darrington. All right. Who are you talking to? (blows raspberry) Many things are possible, though. Have to be within 500 feet. Going down to Tary-town. To where we can see the city and see the road coming to it. What do you think, you think we should camp out here for a while and keep an eye on the road for a day or two? See if we can intercept? And if they never show up, then we need to figure out going into the city. And intercept him. Is there forest on the sides of the road from where we are? So open fields and roads. Shite. Okay. And what's on the sides of the road? Is it tall grass, bald? I'm going to get into some grass, as close to the road as I can. Oh that's a good one. 37. It's a reliable talent, in fact. Horse killing is a feat you took, right? (whoosh) 24. How close are we, right in this second? Or not. Salt, salt. You got a four because of all that salt. What distance am I right now, would you say? Okay, but am I within 50 feet? 60 feet? 60 feet? All right, so I'm going to throw Whisper at her, and she's brambled. Right. Yeah, that hits. That's a 32. I'm going to bamf there on this one, right up to her. That is four plus eight is 12, plus this guy makes it 19, plus these guys. Now we do some more math. 20, 26, 27, 31, 34, 39, 42. With Whisper, right into her back, and then click the Boots of Haste and then I'm going to scuttle to Tary and cut ropes. He's probably within ten feet, right? All right, so I'm cutting him totally loose and I'm going to lift him away. Whatever you'll let me do. Action, action, bonus action, right, and movement to get there. Then I'll use it to cut him loose. Okay. Good enough. You all right, T? Well, initially we thought you could handle it. You're not really in a position of power here, darling. You are rose gold. Bet you're glad for that cloud cover today, aren't you? What should we do here? And how do you want to play this? Because your pops wants you back, obviously. What do you want to do? I'm still watching. Are you sure you're cool to walk in right now? I'm going to yank Vex aside, actually. Are you talking about what I think you are talking about? You want to send her after your friend? You think he wants a mercenary showing up in his life, looking for him? Think about it. He's doing what he wants to do. I wasn't trying to hide it. When you were in Vasselheim-- How would you feel if you learned that we'd sent someone to watch you? He left. He wanted to go. He wanted to be away from us. If he wants to come back, I want him back. What if he's being a father to his child? What if he's enjoying his life? I'm off to the side with Grog going one, two, three, shoot! We could have cut that air with a knife. I know some about the Myriad, correct? Rusty. Rusty Trombone? I understand this is very complicated. Are we really looking for a solution to fix several generations of your family's misdeeds? It sounds like your father, your grandfather have been navigating murky waters for some time. I don't know what the right decision is, either. Do you marry this woman to fix decades of terrible decisions? You make really good blondies, and many things besides blondies, as well. So if we know that that's not happening, then we deal with the problem that is left behind. Which is do we worry about your family's life, their safety? Are they safe here, or are they gonna be eaten alive? God, this sucks. Nah, man! You're one of us now! You're halfway there. He actually can take that much damage, though. Mom was great. She was the best. It was years ago! I've got this great trick, but I can only do it once.
