Hi to PETA, by the way. Is that an Eye of Acomodo for my shirt?! Yeah, he talks just like this! That's my butt! Sound the horns. I'm not really very familiar with Patrick Rothfuss-- I'm willing to wait for it. Yeah, she's trying to keep it on the down low, but Laura doesn't have any of her dice, really. She has three sets instead of the usual ten. Party! What do you sense? Do you sense dragons? I'd work on that. If it's like Luck, it's a no. How high in the air is it? First gets 26, second is a 19. Okay, dagger, dagger, dagger. 14 for the first, and the second is eight. That's it. It's within 40 feet, you said? I am going to Channel Divinity and use a Vow of-- oh, I can't. Can I ditch the second attack? We have no initiative, so I don't know who's where. Am I close enough to go after Grog? I'm following Grog to get his scraps. This knife does the same fucking thing. He's up on the wall? Triple disadvantage for the night! May the odds be ever in your favor. (laughter) We've never seen the picture at that size. And it makes me want to Goonies-style cut a hole in the mouth. 22. How far is he from us at this point? Jeez. How far away is that little rock right at the bottom of that platform that you've got Vex on? How far is that from me? And how high is the wall? Okay. Do I see any wood or anything, a barrel or anything besides stone sticking out? I am going to hold everything until the rest of the party goes this round. Fire walk with me, Red. Yep. I can't do anything now. I have to wait until everyone's done. Give it to me. I feel so brave. (laughter) I stand a full inch taller now. It's from the frogurt shop. (laughter) Monster calves. Do I have a go? Do I get to go? Question can I call out, Vex! Catch! And softball-pitch Whisper up to her? Sure. 26. This should be pretty good. This does involve me. Can I use my Luck for her to re-roll that? Bamf! And I would like to use my bonus action to cast Lay on Hands and give her four hit points. That's it, just four. I get to choose how many And I'll use my movement to scooch my uncomfortable crotch onto this stick you ride all over the place. (groans) Cool. Would evasion work for this? Spell, that's what I thought, I just wanted to check. I'm going to use my last Luck. Oh, I do, and I can add it to that save, right? Good. Oh, then I'm 29. I rolled 11 off of that. Thanks for the limerick. How close was it to us? If it hit us? Can I do an attack of opportunity? All right. Understand, understand. Divine Intervention! Ish. We'll find out. Is the giant within 60 feet of me? All right, so I'm going to move up to the edge. I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Hunter's Mark. Vengeance paladin, yes. Level up! And then I'm going to throw Whisper at the back of her head and hope that it hits. Jeebus. Let's try that again. That is-- I'm going to use-- Mm, yeah. 22. All right. Okay. So-- and I'm going to bamf there. No, I know. And the damage is 12 plus psychic damage is eight! 20. And then I want to use my movement, even though I can't disengage-- Oh, no, I-- Thanks, Mattie! 21. Just one. I can't wait! I love you internet! I love you so much! And then, even though I'm not using disengage, I'm going to use my movement to back the fuck up into that doorway. I'll use Uncanny Dodge. So much fun. Guys, I have 105 hit points. I am swole. Thank you! (grunting) Here's one, here's one. Use it! Echoing from in the gate, you hear, woo! It's ten feet above your head. Fuck, that shirt. Hold the hand cone to the shirt. So handsome! Great. For what? Oh, awesome! I love-- I know all about spells! It's a one. But I have Luck, so I'm going to roll again I have Luck! It's within the rules, yeah. Concentration, straight-- Constitution, straight 16. That was awesome. You sound like you're an actual gnome. (air horn sounds) (laughter) It was on them. Get him, Grog. If I go four down diagonally towards the giant, I'll be within ten feet, yeah? Yeah. I don't want to. Yeah. I am going to use bonus action to cast Vow of Enmity against her. With the feathers bristling in my armor. And then I'm going to use the rest of my movement to back straight back towards the wall, another two or three squares, I think. And I'm going to chuck-- well, we're good. We've got Bigby's Hand right in her private area. But I'm now going to throw Whisper at her back. And I should have advantage because she's busy. Well, and the vow. Either way. It doesn't stack. Right. That or Bigby's. So 26 to hit. So four. That's the dice before I add anything. And then-- Does psychic damage get damage? It's a die. I don't know, I haven't done it. All your dice. Okay. No. Sorry. Ten, and then. Don't message me, internet. Ten, 14, 19, 'cause I don't care, 22, 27, 33, 34, 37. Plus Hunter's Mark. 38, plus my plus eight to the dagger is-- 42. And that's it. I'm out of movement, aren't I? But the bonus action was for the Vow of Enmity, I believe. No, no, no. Yeah. He's keeping you humble tonight. Did he blow on it like an NES cartridge? MATT and So in love! Grog, is that an extra mace over there? Everybody to the trebuchet. You're being punished for using that song. Who is that? She just Boromir'd your ass. And stay down! All right, I want to a little mini curve and go two squares this way and on the way I want to throw, as a bonus action, throw my Flametongue Dagger at my sister. Yeah, so here we go. That hits, that's a 29. So she takes a total of seven points of damage. Okay. Minus seven awesome points. And then I want to walk up to the back of the giantess and stab her in the calf. A natural 20. There are no numbers as high. Plus Hunter's Mark. Shit. Yeah I know. Did I-- yes I did. I forgot just my straight-up bonus that doesn't get doubled. That is 64 points of damage. I want to to walk up and jab Whisper into the back of her calf and then slide it up the back of her leg, up the ass, up the small of her back as high as I can reach. Probably around the tailbone, I don't know. Because I stabbed you. But at least you lost some hit points. Seven. This is just balancing for the Thordak fight. It's all right. What's it like looking at this shirt-mare all night? Hey, my eyes are up here. I will use Evasion, of course. I didn't do too well. I only got 14. 14. Half damage for me. Just killed a pit fiend. If Kima's next to him, as a rogue, does it cancel out and she gets advantage from her ally? Thanks. Slightly sad. What? Gauche. I'll take those. Take a look, Hermione. Check out the brain on Vex. That's a legacy. We've all made awful faces and said stupid things. Oh man, drop some Mentos in there. Lizard-skinned man. But you're so good with words. Do we want to ask him what he knows about the Clasp's activity? Where's the beef? But they might still be resisting. I mean the question-- asking this shithead who still resists within the city will answer a lot of questions. Can you understand a word coming out of my mouth? Could be. Probably, probably. What about Greyskull Keep? Because there was a tunnel from Greyskull Keep into the city. TALIESIN and Two. But I get plus two so it's actually four, Matt, so spill his secrets. Are we done with him? You guys can fill me in, in a bit. And I grab his collar and drag him outside with the rest of the bodies and start overseeing the burning of the bodies. What of the elves? Did I hear correctly that Syngorn has sent forces? One day out. We've an army close to Emon. We do have to talk to Raishan, though. I think we should go to Whitestone immediately, talk to her, and figure out if there's any news with her. But be ready to move to the army from Syngorn, quickly. It might be our best shot, our only shot? But we are out of time. They rest up, we go-- But the mansion can't travel. I mean, you just got used as a weapon; you might want a shower. Well, we said what we were gonna do; we're gonna go to Whitestone. Kiki, set us up. We're gonna talk to Raishan. We met them at Booty, they're totally celestial-- They have, like, angel blood! (laughter) Do you see all of this? Hey, little guy. Grog? Dragon. You're awfully quiet. We need to act. What do you advise? You say "we"? Coachella needs capoeira classes. (laughter) I just lie down across the entire table. They don't stick to my armor somehow? That's not nothing. It connects. That'll get us under the wall. What about-- What about Cashew? What about Shaun? What about Zahra? Yeah, I'm sure he is, but this the end of times. Shaun? For what? For keeping him alive or taking him? Yeah, Allura, what do you want to do? But you have faced him. And that's invaluable. I disagree. You fought this fucking thing before. You know him. That is invaluable. You have more experience than we do. You're wiser than us. Coin toss? Experience. Experience.LIAM,  Ah, sure. (laughter), MARISHA, MARISHA I don't know what would happen. So Gilmore, Gilmore... Well, then, it's covered. Then it's done. Unless you do what Laura and Marisha did and do the exact opposite after the vote. Right? Come on, Allura. No. That's just a throwback to, what episode...? She's talking to her. She's not trying to take her. She's talking about something else. Vox Machina. Smash cut to Gilmore saying, "No fucking way!" You know, Gilmore won the popular vote. (laughter) Dude, that city's probably like the nine circles of Hell, we're not just going to get there, fast track to Thordak. This bullet-proof think-tank.
