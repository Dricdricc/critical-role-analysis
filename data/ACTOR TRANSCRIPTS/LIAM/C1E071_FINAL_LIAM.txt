Put it on. Oh my god. It looks just like Tom Cruise's! Oh my goodness. That's what's inside the black spinning marble underneath Whitestone. We've got to slow you down or Loot Crate is going to poach you for ads. Florida. Yes. I am continuing to be Doctor Strange in various Marvel animated things, and on digital HD, they've got a new animated feature called Marvel's Hulk Where Monsters Dwell, and I am still the sorcerer supreme, where I say things like "eye of Tamagotchi" and "sphere of Esperanto" and other such spells. Check it out. Are you? Can you say who you are? Who are you? My name was in a press release. Laura will play some confident kickass someone or other. Like you do. Literally just got back. It could. No, but we don't know if she has or not. They've got their necks on the line. I know they're not to be trusted, but they're in a precarious position, as well. I've said that, and he's ignored me, so you don't get to say shit! Jeez. We're all about to die tomorrow or the day after. Also, when we were there, we weren't allowed to bring any weapons in, so you're going to have to dump-- Yeah, don't bring your best. I'll take it. I'm not going to use it; I don't know how! Barely. Woo-hoo! Scanlan feels the same way, don't you Scanlan? I'll go with you if Kiki wants to turn me into a crow or a fly or something. I'll stay back and watch. Something white. Yeah, but then if you guys get fucked I'm dead, as well. So it'll just be like every day. All right, yeah. Yeah, can you make me an albino crow? A little bit; this isn't Percy's, but (caws). (laughter) (hacking spit) As they're leaving, not wanting to get left out, I fly down from the air and land in my sister's hair and like a cat (growls) into the top of her head five or seven or 12 times. (caws) Big bonus. Speaking of which hold still, there's a little bit of bird shit right there. Sorry. Bye! A minute passes. This is so great. Now we can all die together! We're all about to lie down for a three-hour nap. What are you talking about? Jeepers. You all right? You look white as a ghost. The door is easy to see. Wake up and it's two in the afternoon? All right. Yeah, we could get piled on. Also, when shit goes down, we don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past. A) we don't want to teleport inside the dragon's belly. Clearly. B) We don't all want to be all grouped together. I'm eating one of these magic candies. Yes, there's chicken. We want to spread out so we're not all blasted at the same time. Separately, though, so you can hit from different angles. Cubby-holes. Up high for anyone who can take to the air, down low for anyone who can't. And as long as we're not synchronized swimming in mist form and spread out, then it should be fine. While they're debating, I pull Whisper out, and I chuck it into a wall and teleport to it. I pulled it out of the Blink-Back Belt. It didn't go into my belt. I went into the wall, and I'm holding it, still. I was a shadow for half a second, and I traveled with the blade. I am fucking Nightcrawler. Holy shit. And I throw it again across the other side. Okay. Sure, that's 27. Aw, suck it haters! This is the coolest dagger I've ever had! I throw it right next to his head, and I don't go anywhere. 24? Does it go to my belt? We can't all be all things, Grog. You are the strongest thing on the planet. You are going to take Vorugal all by yourself-- You shut the fuck up, you trouble-maker. You bust my balls on a daily basis. What is that about? What is that about? What have I ever done but support you? Throw my dagger at the ceiling. Travel with it. Can I land on my sister? I rolled a 27. Quit starting with me. 30. She beat me. Worth it. (groans) I like how excited you are about this. But we're not in the middle of a fight, hopefully. The animals, Kiki, save it for a rainy day? Yeah, we probably all will be dead tomorrow, but it's a really cool idea. I didn't follow that, either. We should do something. This is the quietest you've ever been. Natural 20! It's east. So from Vorugal? It's an earthquake. The trees fell down! Keyleth! Your spells are too powerful! He's been carving it this week. Curved away? We just traveled about a half-mile? Wind fingers for Vorugal. Check for critters. Vax flies around them. Weather forecast is not a bad idea. Where's the closest Erewhon? Aside from Vorugal. Not near us right now. No, the ice is only a foot thick, coating what is normally a temperate region. But it's one spot. No. Because we can use your mansion, and when the time is right, we can all scatter in different directions quickly. Many of us can fly. I would rather have these cubby-holes, as well, but it's too risky, and it's too risky to let you go running your little ass off around and get that dragon to eat you in one bite. You're overruled. Yeah. There are no elves here. My mother was a human. Do you want to go right now? Those are some birds. Ashley's got this. Away from us. We're east. Yeah, half-bubbles almost. Spit some lyrics, girl. Is there any point to having you sharpshoot from behind that wall down below? If we're fighting, I'm not bound by shit, man. I can be anywhere. Well, maybe. Yeah. We kind of have a plan, but fucking dragons. What's your style? Yeah. Told you it was complicated, yeah? The only one that's here. Scanlan, what are you going to do? You going to pop this thing out and then hop in the mansion? That's true. If the mansion door is open and hidden behind that outcropping of rock there, you leave the door open but behind it, Keyleth could take to the sky, I could find somewhere low and be hidden. I can dart inside. I can be inside in a second. Snack. Yeah, we should wake up before sunlight. Also, we've no fucking idea where Raishan is or what she's going to do, if anything. It's me. I'm the last one. I had no idea. It's half of us, Laura! Jeez! 15. Worst-case scenario, we'll pull back towards the mansion if she starts whaling on us. You can get all 19s. You have to do it, right? Because you're the one releasing this thing. And if you're doing it, does it take any more mojo to do it to all of us or just yourself? It can't hurt to do it to all of us. For Larkin? I mean if we trust Tooma to hold up her part of the bargain, that dragon is coming here. I'm going to hide behind the stone that's in the bottom end of the screen I'm looking at. Nope, opposite side. Nope, opposite wall. Sorry. Behind it. And I think I already said it, but the Deathwalker's Ward is set to cold. Natural 20. I'm going to go meditate on disguised dwarves. Goodbye. With Stuart Smalley. Oh, Sam! (groans) Bamf to the door and go in! Make all the action figure sounds, Matt! Natural 20 on my stealth. How high is he? Can I attack him right now? Can I attack him right now? Vorugal. 60 feet. I'm sharpshooter; he's 60 feet away from me. Pop out the wings. Fly within 40 feet of him. Throw Whisper at his ass. That's what I'm doing. Assassin. Do I need to roll for stealth, though? So finally, this is advantage and an automatic critical hit? Assassin trait. All right. I rolled a 28. This is Whisper. I'm using Whisper. I'm going to cast Divine Smite on the attack, as well. Here we go. Two. Hold on. No, so all the dice first. Two plus the psychic damage, which is 1d8. Nine. Plus the Divine Smite, which is 15. Yeah, here comes the sneak attack damage. (counting) 38, plus my modifier which is 46. No, we double the dice first, so 38 times two. 76. Plus eight is 84. Oh, I went with the blade. I'm hasted. That's action number one. Action number two is to throw Whisper down toward the trees closest to you, DM, and bamf there, and use my bonus action to hide. I'll hit the ground, right? I'm going to push off him, then. Yeah, I know that. What did I use? I used 40 feet of movement? Okay. I don't know how much I have left. If I'm hasted, I would have 120 total, but that's halved, so 20 feet, because you said rough terrain. But I'm in the air? So ten feet. That's all right. I'm going to keep moving away. I'm going to use all my movement to get away from him and go away from his butt. I should have a bonus action that I can use. The rest of my movement, plus dash. I have advantage on dexterity saving throws. That hits. Okay. Can I Uncanny Dodge this? Is this melee? Which is halved because of my armor, so 26 down to 13 and seven. 20 total. Okay, so I'm down to 95. I want to use bonus action to dash. I don't know if that gets me 60 feet away flying. It's 120 hasted, so 60 feet halved. Yes. Yes, sir. Okay, so it's an 11. Well, you guys saw it. People inside can't hear me. Hey, B-T-dubs, I've just learned that Whisper can only bamf me once per round, right? To stick within 60 feet. Got it. Don't roll? You get advantage, right? Oh jeepers, we're going to die. Oh, I am? I would like to throw Whisper to the rock I was initially hiding behind and bamf there. Yeah. Sure, that's 25. I would like to use my bonus action to hide behind that rock. That is a 25. Can I hold my last action? I'm going to stay put. Stay hidden. I'd like to think of you driving and cutting someone off on the 101 and going, "Plus five necro." Hi. Could I use Evasion for this? All right. I'm going to use Luck. First Luck of the day. All right, 13. Big Grog! Wait. I'm sorry. Yenk knew where I was. Did the dragon know where I was, too? Holy shit. Yeah, I'm going to take to the air. Holy shit. I'm going to fly within 60 feet of Vorugal. 55 feet away. All right, Uncanny Dodge. Okay, so how far did I just go? 55 feet. I can go 120 in one action, so that's my movement. Halved, but 120, so that's my movement, total. I'm going to throw Whisper in his face. I'm not going to bamf there; I'm just going to throw the dagger. Vorugal's face. That's halfsies, so I'm going to roll it again. That's way better. That is a 32. One. That is 12 plus the psychic damage. I don't think so. Not since waking up. 12, plus two is 14, and I'm going to cast Divine Smite-- no, I'm not. No, just 14 of damage, so that's movement, action. My next action I'm going to use to fly under him, halfway between Percival and the gang, and land on the wall. Yeah. Now, that wall is higher up than it looks, so I'm really flying straight, right? Yes, and then for a bonus action, my last spell slot, I'm going to cast Shield of Faith on my fucking self for a plus two to AC. Action figure is down. Get that epic loot drop. What? Where did that dwarf come from? Did you hire more mercenaries? When are they showing up? Hey, I'll own it. It's fine. It's been a long week. All the trees are down. Rolled two dice. Hold for him to drop? Oh, sad Grog. Can you yank his shit down? Oh jeez! Really? Okay. So I'm right there. Am I within 60 feet? I'm going to fly 20 feet forward through the storm toward him. Yeah. Dagger, dagger, dagger. They come back, man. First is 26. Second is a 17, but I'm going to use my second Luck, so the second is a 21. And the third is 19. Okay, so the first one was really high. The second two are mediocre. Whisper hits. No, I didn't think so. That is terrible. That's just ten. And I use my movement to fly directly under him. Say again? No. No... Yes, I am. Could I have hit him in the tail? I got the blade on his tail, and I'm there. That's where I am. Is that melee? Can I use Uncanny Dodge? Shite! Yeah, Uncanny Dodge. Wait! I want to use my last Luck to make him roll again. Which I can do. Wow. It's all right. Uncanny Dodge! Thanks, Matt. That hits. And I'm out of Uncanny Dodge, right? You've hit me right now? Yeah, that hits. Thanks, Heroes' Feast. Cards on the table! He's going to take 15 percent of your hit points. Did he move away? Yeah. No sneak attack because it's just me and Bigby, right? Right, because there's nobody here with me. 27 hits, so that is a three plus eight is 11, plus my psychic damage is 12. That'd be great, cut him in the butt. I'm a field medic. I'll get you out. Maniac! Here it is! Get it! This is a rage spanking, right here. Mighty Yenky has struck out. I know that from here to here, I'm 100 feet, so from the angle, am I 180 feet away to Pike? I want to save one action to grab Pike and yank her, so that means I have an action and a bonus action and movement to fly a total of 360 feet, halved, which is 180 feet to Pike, like a rocket. Grab her and roll into the door of the mansion. I can arc. And roll us into the door. That hits. Do I have momentum, grabbing her? I would imagine I did this. That's the intention. Up and over. I'm out, dude. I've got five hit points. But he bit me, right? 20. Go earth elemental! It's all right. I'm fine. At the zoo? You weren't trying to call Satan? Blow everything you've got. Blow it. He's leaving. Unleash. 17. A ten and a three! (laughter) Vorugal ain't shit! I'm going to find Larkin. Is Thordak scared yet?
