And good memories. (laughter) Gambling? (shrieks) Oh my goodness. Okay, with a thank-you in advance and afterwards as well. We'll edit this part out, right? I just meant the unwrapping. Oh. Oh my god. Yes. Not big enough. It's a-- aw, man-- it's beautiful. It's a ring and it's got raven feathers on it and a little black gem. And on the inside it says, "Do not go far from me." Thank you. It fit. It is beautiful. I love it so much. Perfect. Love it. That's a great birthday present. Roughly speaking, how many of those did we see when we came up? T.D., do you have anything that lets you teleport us all? One other idea. What if I go in as bait, make a lot of noise, and as they swarm I throw Whisper and throw it into his shoulder blades, and then on I'm piggyback. Yes, but would the Fireball, where they are, encompass them all or-- I'm just saying if they-- Is the noise centered on your gun, though, and not down below? Or you've created tsunamis, as well, d'you think you could flush them out? Whoa. Glass houses, and all of that. I love that everybody was up here bickering and Pike just went "hm." (laughter) There's none left? They're all gone? We could've smushed those and gotten so drunk. Yeah, I'm going to start eyeballing the room while sis goes and talks. Break the news to dad, yeah? Whose house? T's house. Not the first, not the last. By the way, do you have any beast changing left in you? Could you go Minxie for me? I want a pillow. I just turn into Macklemore. What you got, Bertie? A lot of carbs. Americano. Hey. I take a step forward and unsheathe a dagger an inch and say, we're going to keep this civil today, aren't we? Sir. Second chances are a gift. I pray you don't squander it. I don't think that's a half-bad idea. We're all very proud of you. Sorry, pull the plug, people, wrap it up. Quivering Palm the Sun Tree. Is this a festival? Are there heirloom tomatoes? I'm going to use Luck. No I'm not, I'm kidding. Is that for real, that one? What the hell? I take an instinctive step forward, just a half step in front of Vex. Hey, friend. You look like you're headed this way, did you need something? With you so far. Which is where? On the end is '-hard' or '-heart'? Heart. Right. Like opening a peanut butter jar, or how big? Is Shorthalt around right now? Is this a prank? Is that was this is? Is this a joke? Insight check. It's fine. No, it's not fine. That's better. 14. Where on yourself does he come? Excuse me? Did you cross the ocean to get here? Is your boss with you right now? Did he come with you or did he send you? Shut the fuck up! He's here right now? We're moving, we're moving. Oh, you prefer Lionel! This is going to be difficult. Call her little elf girl, and you can call me little elf boy. Could we meet your boss? Are you a bouncer? Is he playing music and you're his bouncer? Do you rough up people who try to cause trouble? Sure, that's what I do. So we get to meet the Meat Man? And, fucking Scanlan! You are very likeable. Do you have problems talking to people? To women, even? JONL No, no, I'm really good at talking to myself sometimes. That's where I get most practice. Let's meet this chap! This is the craziest 48 hours, I swear to all the gods. I'm looking for weirdness and traps. 24. 24. No traces of poo anywhere? Who's asking? Incoming whisper! The hottest penguin I ever saw. Ziggurat. Another one. You can tell us later. How'd you hear about this compatriot? How do we know you're not selling us a song? Who was this compatriot of ours? He said someone came through? He's talking about this guy? Little bit more, please. Man or woman? It's kind of a sticking point for us. You're coming to us with one piece of information that we may be interested in, but you're accidentally tipping your hand towards something else that we want to know about. We know a Meat Man, and he is not you. Do you know the muffin man? Roll back a step or two. Dealt with how? The name was simply meat-ed out. Before you leave-- prison. What was this other Meat Man's offense? Do you know? You don't know anything. Do you like working for that guy? We have mutton. What about this guy? For Wildmount! Your brigade! I mean, you got to start somewhere! You were rough around the edges when we met you! Reverse engineer. You sound like you know about the stakes involved. I mean, Tary, Grog is about as smart as a golden retriever and he does great. We got an actual dice roll in the game! Everybody speechless. I was starting to follow. I push the door open... Holy shit! Holy shit! We're in an alley, though, off to the side, right? Well, then I'm giving him a big fucking hug! It's not... Does it have anything to do with charm, or sleep, by any chance? No. Okay. All right. Oh, that's fine. 20. That is a really good accent. True. We want to hear all of that information. So are we going to do this in an alleyway, or are we going to go get a drink, and you tell us where the fuck you've been? Whatever. Come on. We want to hear what you've been doing for a year. Come on! Boy, that's got to suck. I'm curious. Talk to us, man. No, no, no. After you, dear. After you. Where have you been? Where's Kaylie now? How are you two doing? There's that Owl's Wisdom right there. In a year. Nothing dangerous? Why now? Why have you come back? Not that I'm not overjoyed to see you, but I'm curious. Could be both. Pyramid's good. We're with you, yeah. Roughly how many? More than us? And they all looked the same? Nobody looked a little more important than the others? No one wants to kill you. What's your best-case scenario here? What did you hope would happen? You'd come and tell us these things and then what happens next? With you? He's back. Are you happier now? That doesn't sound too bad to me. No, I think she's right. Can I tell you a secret? All this last year, I've known we would see you again. It's good to see you again. Give him time. Grog. Little steps. Oh, I was just about to ask you the same thing. We're all agreed on that, at least. I love the malice radiating this way, and the absolute lack of recognition. We're not here. I thought you and I-- I asked... They all left, we were behind. This is the problem when everybody's thoughts are in different heads. It's the saxophone player from Lost Boys greased up! Lionel, with his nunchucks, in the family den. They were actually vultures. (laughter) Yeah, I've got a flask. This is complicated. Real complicated. Me, too. Grog and Pike were not happy to see him. Yeah. Yeah. I think they will, but you're right, it will take some massaging. You know, I wasn't lying, I knew we would see him again. This has been nice. It's always nice. I'm real happy in my setup these days, but-- That was the implication, yeah. But I miss you busting my balls on the regular. I think-- we were about to head back, but we've got to get this sorted out first. What do you reckon's next? We're going to Marquet, then? You all right? You don't seem fine. Mm-hm. Are you getting at something? I feel like I'm missing something. Well, I'm not mad at him. I hope Pike and Grog can come around. I hope so. I feel like, you know. Yeah. I wonder if it's time. Nothing, I'm drunk, never mind. Did you see this ring I picked up? Yeah, while you guys were fucking about with him. It's very handsome. Yeah. Well. I love you. All of us. All of us. Do you want to go find the rest? Let's go find the rest. Big man? Insight check. It was really low. Yeah, too much to drink, probably. Pickled Pickle. He's likable. Are they fist-fighting in the background? Fuck him up, babe! He's turtling. I mean, would you stop it? I do, I like him already. He's instantly likable. I was trying to... I was trying to pitch him to Tary, but I really like him. I want him to stay. Hey, you know, I feel like we were about to make our exit, but it's a little more complicated now, right? Might need to stay on a day or two. I think we got to. Don't use the Message spell to drop heavy shit! Maybe you should just sleep on it before leaving town, buddy. And some of us are happy to see you. All over the earring.
