Oh, yeah, hey! You know my love for Wyrmwood Gaming and their boxes. We have these beautiful ones. Lift up a Wyrmwood box. They make great, beautiful boxes. They have all kinds of woods to hold your dice in, and if you use the code "critrole," you will get free shipping. But also, today, I would like to let you all know that Wyrmwood Gaming has a kickstarter for their Sentinel box. I'm sure I'm forgetting the actual name, but it's a beautiful box. It's good for D&D, it's good for Magic The Gathering, and it holds cards, it holds dice, there's a Bluetooth in it so that if you lose it, you can find it. It's called the Sentinel deck box. There's also a version of it called the Vox Machina, which is a premium item, and it's gorgeous. Premium. But tossing this out, too, if you guys want any of the other Sentinel deck boxes and you want to get the logo etched onto it, that's also an option. I don't know if it's on the site or not, but it will be. 'Twill be there. Gorgeous box. Wyrmwood crashed? Sorry, Wyrmwood. Or you're welcome, Wyrmwood. I should say, the etching is a new development, so if that's not happening today, it'll be there tomorrow-ish. It's another beholder! Following. I don't know, why is it? They look like they're hurting. It's late. Sun's gone down. Here's an idea. Scanlan, you said that a lot of people can go into your house, yeah? Could you-- (laughs) Could you invite the folk in, and then they live in your hole for a little while, and then when we get to Whitestone, you open your hole and out they come? Scanlan is the mule. Didn't you say 100 people, the other day? I see. Is that a yes or a no? You just don't want to bring them in. She can read lips so she doesn't even get that close. Oh, I guess I'm going then. Grass, grass. 32. Can we just sit for five or ten minutes? But we are. But we are. All right. All right. I'm just going to stay here for a couple of minutes longer. Wait, you said they were coming our direction or they're just-- ? You're paranoid! Let me listen for a bit. All right. 22. All these throwbacks are blowing my mind. Yeah, yeah. Do we have to go back to tell them to come on in? Well, yeah, that's true No. He was-- Drez Vina. Drez Vina was the dick. Drez Vina's a dick. This was only three years ago. What was, DM, can you remind me the name of the mother that we spoke to all that time ago? Elowen? Elowen. I'd rather go talk to her. Hands up. No weapons. We also think there's a woman with you named Elowen. She knows us. We'd like to speak to her. We'll wait here. Elowen! I kneel down next to him and I say do you want to see something cool? Look at this. And I take off the serpent belt. And-- (snake hisses) And I put him around my neck. I named him after you. (laughter) He's my pet. Do you want to, he's gentle as a lamb. Do you want to tickle his neck? Yeah. Here, you hold him. I set it down around his neck. Don't worry. Nothing's going to happen. It's fine. Simon, fart in his ear. Go ahead and fart in his ear. It's good to see you again, kiddo. Come here, Simon Jr. I'll put him back, now. We'll see you again. If we could help you relocate quite a ways away, would you be open to that? You can tell we're a motley bunch of assholes. We've seen shit and we've done shit and we can do shit. Are we? Well, I'll tell you, in times like these, it will feel good to be able to do a bit of good. That's wise. And it's not a lot of gnomes. I'm assuming it's a handful of gnomes. Always wish Pike was here. I've still got the other one. Right here. (singing) D-E-A-R C-A-S-S, how are you? I'm fine. Wow! You know what I'm doing! A theatre nerd, yeah. Secret Garden, ladies and gentlemen. Can we have the break so Taliesin and I can go make out in the other room? Also of note, you're going to be going through a tree. Just go with it. You're going to be-- It's kind of frightening, though, if you don't know it's coming. It's still a little weird for me, to be honest. I'm going to curl into the butt end, which is all I get. All I ever got while we were traveling. I fart on him all the time. Bada-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang. Oh crud. Big two! Ey-oh! (exploding sounds) Hopefully nobody saw the comely half-elf flying through the bright blue sky. Maybe you can join Dr. Dranzel in the circus. You can't fight the power of the one. Blood for the blood gods. Climb through, climb through, you have to move quickly. What are the subjects of your experimentation? What are we talking about, a pile of coin, or something else? Come on. Don't treat us like a bunch of fucking assholes. It's in the middle of shit right now. We're not going to go in there for a trinket. It's obviously something very worthwhile. You would have a better chance with us if you're honest. Yeah, you're an asshole. You're the biggest asshole. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to you. I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to you. I did not go up to Pike. I hung way the fuck back. Archers! He is a tactician. Through it to the base of the mountain. That's a real place. You just Tyler Durden-ed out, son! Little golden bullet. I walk away. Big nope to that one. It's like we're back in New York again. I got to say this? I don't want these assholes to know what I'm thinking. I don't know. Can't whisper it to her. Yeah, I'll text it to you. No. Canon, that's canon. What? What? You want to talk? It was 30. Yes, please. She's already speaking to me. I don't know, Vex'ahlia. I don't know what this means. I know that she's not a force for evil. Neither are funeral homes. I don't want to bed down in one. But it doesn't matter. And I'd do it again, because I did it for you, and I am trying to come to terms with it, not knowing the terms. Maybe so. Do you know how bad this armor smells? It's several centuries old. It's not pleasant. Maybe. Listen. I'll take what you say under consideration. Again, none of us, you and I don't know what this means. I'm waiting to see. I have no clever answer to give you. I go to bed. Scanlan's like, wasn't looking in on Pike. Wasn't looking in on Pike. It is the danger room. Like a Shoprite bag with a bunch of shit in it? Do you want some more broom target practice? You do need to practice, seriously. I'm still eating. I would love to see you, for five minutes, get up on that broom and fly around and fucking put some arrows in some chickens. It helps me. Pull! Pull! Full damage. The chicken comes back to life! 20 chicken McNuggets fly through the air. For the greater good. I will never forget it. Yeah, it's right there. Let's move on, let's move on. Are your people-- Did you grow up in the cold? Wow. Everybody starts inhaling snow. To the what? What obelisk? I'm brainfarting, so I'm just following Percy. Look at that! Basilisks here, yes. I'm closing my eyes. 18. Merry Christmas. Yeah, it's Scanlan next to one of them. Professional D&D player. All right, okay. Yes. I'm going to click my heels together, set the boots going. I'm going to go very far away towards you, your end of the map. I want to be about a little away from the tree, though, so I've got a clear sight on that one-- further back, though. I know. I want to be 50 feet away. Yeah. And I'm going to dagger-dagger-dagger him from very far away. And I'm going to use that sharpshooter trick where I take a negative five to attack, but add ten to damage? No. From this far away? Okay. So constitution? 16. Yes. Oh yeah! Gamble worked out, man! Yeah, I know. First one, and advantage because I'm going before it, so the first one is 18. Second is 14. And the third is 27. Last hits? Okay. First one gets sneak attack damage, and plus ten to both hits because of the sharpshooter. Right. So, here we go. I can't think! 33.... 43 for the first one. No-no-no... 43 plus... 49 for the first one. And the last one that hits is 19. Sharpshooter. I will take another ten feet back away from it all. Bye, guys! (singing) You got to know when to hold 'em! Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie? It was a lot harder the last time. (Grog voice) I can't see you but I'm so angry! You said you averted your gaze. Although with coffee in the eye, disadvantage is back. Just a bunch of idiots dorking around, guys. I'm listening! The one by Grog. Say it again. Holding it in your hand while you're flying on it? I'm not looking at you. All right, I'm off the map, but I want to try to come down towards the tree that I think Percy's at. He's between two trees. I'm going to avert my gaze, I'm going to look at the ground, come up around the side of that tree, and I'm listening for scorpion clacking and basilisk hissing, and I'm going to throw, dagger dagger dagger, in the direction of the basilisk I hear near scorpion claws clutching. Does that make sense? All right. So this is at disadvantage because I'm looking at the ground. So first one is... first one is a 21. And second one is... 19? Third one is 16. No, not at all. So we've got ten, plus nine, plus ten. Daredevil. Laura Bailey dies on stream. "I can't breathe down here!" Shite. It's critical. I think we can all agree it's the jelly of the month club at this point. Oh, that's all? 16. Look, you're just doing what the bossy half-elf told you to do. Just go with it. That's the only bossy half-elf here. Oh, for fuck's sake. Here we go, people. Here we go. And we're moving. You should piss on the obelisk just to be sure. Half-elves look at the building structure. 26. The mapmaker? I take... Wait! Everybody shush! I look at him for a moment and then I leave him, and I don't tell anyone else. I don't tell anyone else. Pike didn't see him. His arm is broken off! You don't fucking know he exists. He's gone. Wait, wait, wait, I go to Pike. I go to Pike. Pike. Do you remember that mapmaker? Were you with us? So much shit has happened. Do you remember Tyriok the mapmaker? There's a man over there. His arm is gone. Can you fix stoning? Can you fix a man who's been turned to stone? Two years ago, yeah. What did we do? I need to take a walk. Could you do that? Could you do that? Look over there by that tree there. Do you see him? There's two hands pointing towards the sky. Two. Groan. Not bad enough to actually do it, though, right? Have some squirrels, buddy. Technically true. While all of that happened, for the last ten minutes, can I stealth away for a little bit? 31. I don't want to go that far, I want to go so I can still hear all this bullshit behind me, and find a quiet spot... I know you can hear me. I'm going to need... I'm going to need more than nightmares. A deal has been struck, and I will honor it. I need to understand what this is. Any time. Fuck. Not exactly what I was talking about. At some point, a little bit of clarification. Congratulations, you're creepy as fuck. We'll work it out. I head back to the group. Heebie-jeebies. (bang! bang! bang!) We need our Pike. It's our 49th! Shopping episode.
