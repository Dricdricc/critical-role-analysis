Are we out of combat now? Okay. I'm going to, clutching my bleeding belly, walk over toward Keyleth and say, that was a close one. You know I'm in love with you, right? And I kiss her. No. You know, the way you turn into animals and stuff is really cool. Folks, we don't know what we're doing. None of us know what we're doing. Was there a total? Yes, I feel better. Thank you. Who? Percival, he had a knife to your sister's throat. He was going to kill her. I was afraid she was going to die. I'll look with Scanlan. 27. Well, let's unlock that. No, Shorty. Hold on. Are there any traps in there? Oh, that is 20. So what do I roll to undo that? Dexterity? Lockpick? That's a natural 20, so that's untrapped. So now I've got to unlock it, right? Yeah. Hey, 20. No, not a natural 20. Percival, come here. You're probably the best person to know what to make of these. He could be spying on us around the keep. I'm going to insight check as he does that. It's a 15. Did we just have a short rest here? Going to heal up. Don't roll a one. I would like to walk past Scanlan and grab it out of his hand. You go first. Shut up. 27. And I walk over to Cassandra. I don't give her the gun, I just say, you're Cassandra? I was at the door. He had a knife to your throat. He wanted you to say something to us. What did he want you to say? You've been living here. How did it come that he had a blade to your throat today? How did it all unravel? Have you been living here? I want to suggest something to you. We rest here for a half hour, and I give this to you. This came from a very strange creature. It will help you resist any control, if there is any control, and one of us-- you could even choose-- could strike you and try to take you out of it, and if you are not being controlled, then you are being struck across the face, and I'm sorry for that, but if you are, there's a possibility we'd pull you out. I know that would hurt, but it would go a long way to earn our trust. Your choice. What if the little one struck you? I don't know. I don't think she's evil. She could be a puppet. Resistant to it. Clever boy. No. I'll take it back, yeah. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever been down here? He's playing both sides, possibly, Percival. Is he a big Percy? You're welcome. 30. Natural 20. That's with the bonus. I gave her my fucking cloak, Matt. Kiki, I'm over here. (imitating Grog) Is this the body-switching episode? Dagger. How about Grog in second place? You big sponge. I'll be behind Grog, as well. 26. I grab it back. How many of us found this? I've got one. And Percy's got the other? I walk away from the group all the way to the back, and I take it-- Yeah, towards where we came from. What's behind us? Is it just tunnel back that way? Yeah, I push through the back of the group to the back. What's behind us? I was going to throw it, but... 20. 20. We've got company. Ghosts. Wraiths. 15. (quietly) Oh, she's gone. Charisma saving throw? Okay. Okay, so a 12 for me. Am I caught, as well? Yeah. No, that's two, isn't it? What just happened? They all do. Yeah. The first was a 13. The second was a 22. Eight. 18. Okay. All right. I'm going to click my boots together. I'm going to move towards him. Towards Percy. Shit. I'm going to take the keen dagger and stick it into his gut, and I'm going to take the glove with the symbol of Sarenrae and punch him in the nose. 20 for the dagger. The punch is just strength modifier, right? 17 for the punch. Nine. Wait. How far did I go? I want to spring back and run as far as I can in the other direction, around the corner towards the rest. It is 18. Rogue. That hits, but what's applicable? Uncanny Dodge or Evasion for a gunshot? That's Uncanny Dodge. Am I able to slide around Keyleth closer to you, into that little alcove, or am I too pressed against the wall? The other way. Okay. That's all right. I flip the daggers over, and I start to whale on the back of Keyleth's head. Pommels of the daggers. 18. Definitely. Second one is 20. And then 32 on the last. Three. Plus seven is ten. And the ten gets doubled? Or everything? Ten, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 50. 50 for the first hit. Well, then no. 25. Thank you. Plus nine, plus nine. 38. I'm going to use-- I don't care. I'm going to slide around Grog, to the side. Towards Scanlan. Right there, yeah. Yes. I've got gunshots in my back. I start sprinting around that open hallway near Cassandra. I stop by Cassandra and dagger, dagger, dagger. First one is 30. Second one is 15. Third is 28. They all hit? Good. Ten plus seven is 17. 27 total. All magic. Wait. I ran 20 feet? 30 feet? 35? Can I run the "west" of the way-- The "west" of the way through it in front of Percy. Yeah. That's what I want to do. I double back to Keyleth and start trying to administer some sort of aid. Medicine check? Is that it? 18. She needs help. Scanlan, come here. Who feels like making camp? Yes. I'm exhausted.
