Think of the gigs of erotica that could just exist out there. Is there any other shitty bragging anyone else would like to do? What it? What came out? It was a bear? I go over to Trinket and I surreptitiously start feeding him biscuits-- you don't know-- biscuits that I took from my father's house. Good boy, that's a good boy. Good job. I will always give you that shit. Don't forget. We're not here to go spelunking. Why are we going to go in this cave? Plus, do you know there's a theater here? I understand, but just so we don't accidentally go there, where is it in relation to this tree? Is it on the way? I don't trust anyone who doesn't like the theater. What exactly is your issue with it? I don't think that we should do anything. It does seem like a bit of a double standard that everybody threw poo at Keyleth for picking a flower. Are you dead yet? I don't want to take that bet. No, I don't want to take that bet because I agree with you. 100 seconds have gone by. You're going to roll a 20 and decapitate him. This guy wants to go to the theater. Oh man, that sounds scary. Hey, how about that Chroma Conclave, eh? We should move toward our destination. No more stops. Unless it's for the theater, we're not stopping again. I was wondering the same thing. She's Duchess of the Grape Hunt so she's very good to lead. He's a bit of a sneak, too. The only reason we have him is because you spotted him because you're awesome. We're so much cooler now. He eats her hand. Are they way ahead of us or are they just up ahead? Is he taking us to the theater right now? We don't need to stick a stick into every beehive we come across. Is it the theater? You said we have to get across, regardless, Garmelie? I don't think it's a good idea but if we're going to check it out you and I should go ahead. Yeah, let's go. All right. 39. Our mother read us stories about shit like this. Yes, she did. Fairies. Grumpkins. I don't know. It's probably going to end badly. Do you want to go have a look? Why start now? You want to break our stealth? If I do not see a mummer's show from this, there will be hell to pay. Now let's go. I will go closer. 39 stealth. Yeah, is it? Because I have advantage if it's a charm effect. And I'll use one Luck for the day. First Luck. All right. 17. I'm on, man. I'm lit. Fucking werewolf guy look good. Oh dear. Okay. Because I have advantage against charm. Oh, then I rolled shit. It's just a five. First conscious person to go in here. Grog was unconscious. She just dumped me out. It's not my call. I'm in the necklace krumping right now. The woods are full of Irishmen. That was 35 episodes ago. Did we see a play yet? Half-elves have advantage on charm. Is the footing here precarious? I know she's leading us through, but is it all viney and shitty? I give Scanlan a little boot in the butt forward a couple of steps. Works for us. I don't really want to fight a group of werebeasts, but we have much better chances, if we're going to pick a side, against them with their brute strength, than against fucking pixies. I am charmed at the drop of a hat! Well, they are cursed. They seem very unhappy. They have to sit in rolling chairs at all times. There are scary fairy stories, though, growing up? We really bollocksed up the musical instruments scenario, and I don't feel like the pixies are going to be much better than that. Yeah, we ran in for 30 seconds, shit the bed, and then got the hell out. We didn't try to end them. We didn't finish anything. Can't we just thread the needle and play them both? You also wanted to hear the music. That didn't go well. We've got a bow to get you. We are idiots. And Vex is the only one that can see it. I'm going to go stealth, just because. 25. All right, that is kind of fucked up. What was the goal here? To grab part of the circle? Desecrate it? Is it an open area over the village? It all depends on the definition of desecrate. I could fly you 500 feet in the air, and you could shit upon that circle. It just depends if that is desecration in the eyes of the fey. The fairies or the fairy circle? Wouldn't it just destroy the circle? How long does that last? Just to give us a day's head start. We think towards the bog. The horror, the horror. I grab Keyleth by the wrist and start running away from the village. Go, run faun, run. Natural one. I'm shouting The way is clear! Well, I rolled a one, but then I used Luck and I rolled a 20. He's basically good against anything except one of the ancient dragons. You want to go to the theater. What's your problem with the arts, man? Did it feel like a theater? The wall of a theater? What is this thing, Garmelie? Never ever? See what we did to those pixies? Wrecked. You took off before we shook hands or anything. Would've been a good incentive for us to destroy the pixies. We can't proceed without destroying the pixies. Got to love it when the crew laughs at your final death crack. The pixies are bitter little assholes. Do we want to waste any time trying to take your broom up and see how high this barrier goes? No, when we ran into it, it felt like a brick wall. They're certainly no meaner than Grog is. They're just scarier. I agree with Percival. I think all our options are shit. We pick the least shitty and see what happens. Shuffle shuffle, flip page, flip page, flip page. Just start pissing. Ow. Why did you do that? What do you mean? I take off flying. Can I Spider-Man from tree to tree like the werewolves did using the wings a little bit? 28. I'm still fucking asleep is the problem. Are you shorter? That's impossible. I know all this. She told me two hours ago. Do we have any concept of what time it is in this perpetual night? Yeah, stay up with me. Stay up with me. Don't offer that. 27. Do you see that? No. Well, sort of. Let's watch them. I don't think we should go out. I think we should let the group rest. No, your friends. We'll let them sleep unless those things come closer. Are they coming closer, or are they keeping their distance? Don't move. I go stealth. Do I have that camouflage? 25. Come on, Grog! Come on. I'm staying still. We have to talk about your diet. Your diet! Do you eat any greens at all? I crawl over to my sister and shake her and say wake up! Don't fly away like I did. Oh, wait, your broom's over there, all right. They are watching us. They came in close, and then they left, so I don't think we're safe anymore. Maybe, yeah. That's it, you put him back to sleep? You go back to bed, then. You're letting Whitey go back to sleep, then? Yeah. I think it's apt. Fuck it. I go back to bed. I spoon Keyleth and fall asleep. Yes, pull out all of your cursed items. Hair is shiny, eyes are bright. What are we talking about? Is that temporary? Is that going to last? We misspoke. To destroy this circle. Honestly, we're scared of both you and the lycan, and we just want to pass through. We want no harm for you, and unfortunately, them, either. We just want to walk on out of here. Their leader is massive. We were scared. This one wet his leg, and he's gigantic. We just didn't know what to do. We've got a tea set. Oh, that angle is not going to be kind to those trees. The werewolves were honorable. These guys are assholes. 13. What about just a comb? Shit. (Gollum voice) Nasty. Aw, that's sad. Passive-aggressive dungeon master! Oh, that's so sad. Oh. Damn it, Bobby. That's Scanlan's bag, man. I've got advantage. Good, I got a 19. Being a half-elf. Oh, it's not charm, is it? Then the first one was shitty. Ten or 11, somewhere around there. Can I use luck to take my second roll? I have luck left? I have two luck left, after sleeping. Okay, so the second was a 17. Plus two, would've been a 19. No, I really would like to be a kitty cat. I asked if I could use one of my lucks instead. In my heart, I am a kitty cat. There's worse things than being a kitten, right? We should have all been pixies from the beginning. Click go the boots. I'm going to run 12 squares and squat down just north of Grog. I'm not going to shit on you. I think I can make it all the way around to the other side of Grog, and I'm going to dagger, dagger, dagger at queen of the pixies there. Okay, first is shit, second is a natural 20. Third is an 18. All right. Yeah, but it's not anything fancy. That's the weakness of the rogue. Where's my pyramid? There it is. So the first one which was the critical is big 11 for the first one on a critical. And the second one, I'll put poison on it, as well. Seven for the damage, and it's a DC of 15, for poison. That's 2d10. 14 with poison. The grace and poise of the Ashari. Umbrasyl, in the can. Fairies, dead as shit. So add six to what you were saying, originally. You said 20, so it'd be 26 if you're doubling that die. They could possibly turn on us, though. Y'all ready for this? Which one? I was next to go, but that's still good. It actually rolled when you moved the paper. Straight up 15. Fuck it, I'll use luck. I've got one more. Another 15. I was about to, but not anymore. Am I restrained, or am I slowed? So I can still do stuff? What do freezing up and haste do mixed together? Anything? Cancel out? Do I have a third attack? Very confusing. Feywild, man. I am going to dagger, dagger, dagger the pixie in front of Scanlan, so I should get sneak attack? I don't have advantage, so I don't get sneak attack. That's three attacks. First one is shit. 19? All right. Second one is 19. The last one is a 15. Yeah, whatever. 11. And eight. 19 total. No. And I say (strained). No, I used it all up. I didn't cross it off. Two. Eye squint says no. Big swollen hand, fucking fat veins on the back of the hand. I do, I literally do. Twinkies? I don't think that's the term you're reaching for. Scanlan? I'm going to follow close behind Grog. Yeah, but if they had any good in their heart, why would they be trapping travelers of any kind?
