He's wearing it on his face. That's Strongjaw. Wears it every day. So exciting! Oh, it's on the shelves, we've been playing it for weeks here! You can play it as well if you go to your local shop or download it or get it at a store--I already said that but you can play samurais-- we have no samurais here. You can play knights-- Hey!-- or you can play Vikings-- you can use this guy! You know, honestly, you two having the time to sit down and watch two bad movies-- When I don't have time to watch one good movie-- -- is offensive. That is offensive to me. It will help me when I'm dying. That is true-- I guess it's time to climb this mountain and throw myself off. See, actually, this is one of those instances where it sounded halfway between Vax and Vex-- It could work for either of us. It's the "ae" thing. Â We have a lot of stuff in that bag. Yeah. Let the big guy play. MARISHA and I'm curious if we could uh, it was Ermergerd, right? Ermergerd Swearengen, yeah. (all laugh) Fucking don't like this guy. I'm curious, where do you hail from? Are you from here? Ooh. Who is that guy and what is email? Stark. No we've not been. Yeah? Bring back the history lesson, though. So pampered, young, everything you could ever want-- Those were my words. Go on. Same. Same. Is that code for masturbating? Bequeathed to you. Lost count. Yeah, we have. Multiple dragons. How old are you, exactly? You and I are the same age. That is all right. No. No. Thumbs down. I grab my sister by the arm, and I drag her off the the side. What-- Why are we doing this exactly? Why are we bringing him with us, exactly? You think he can pay 50k an hour for realsies? Oh, that was not good. That's probably wise. Yeah. And we also didn't offer access to every contact and person that we know on this globe, all right? You're a tag-along. VM Accounting. Hey, Percy... I faintly remember you talking about, you were talking to someone, I don't know who it was, but you were talking about plans you had for sort of a walking, automated something. Am I imagining that? Yeah, I can see that. To be honest, you seem like you got your goolies burned there just from a conversation, a little bit. Well, you're the expert. Walking with Kelyeth. You know I don't know anything about that shit, but in my experience talent and skill have nothing to do with whether you're a douchenozzle or not. He seems like a schmuck. Yeah. He called you 'antlers'. Mm. Nothing at all No, they're very attractive I'm sure you heard--- Okay? It's your best feature. No, definitely the antlers. Duty. Does he cook? Does he clean? Keep you warm at night? Or siblings? What were Mom and Dad like? I mean when you were a tyke. What is your father's business? A businessman? Is that a taboo subject with you? Oh, fuck-all. I thought you could give me the layman's terms. A land baron. Interesting... Interesting. Can I insight check him on 'I have nothing'? It's terrible, that's all right. You shush! I will use luck if I want to use luck! I'll say! (sings the Legend of Zelda 'item' tune) Scanlan had it... No, there was a symbol. J'mon's symbol to show to all friends. That's not the same thing. We are friends to-- the man on top. J'mon, I misspoke. Vox Machina is here, he knows us. Serpersveshzhg? Would you send J'mon, would you send them our thanks? Buddy boy, you're buying in for shit you're not really ready for, yes. We're gonna take a little time for a day. And then we're gonna take you to hell. How does that sound? Wow. Sure. I don't know. Do you want to put him through his paces? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's take this fucker to hell. We are going to Hell. And you are coming along. Yeah, well, let's bring him home. Yeah, we want Grog to run him out like a labrador. He only has to listen to you at home. Yes, get your big boy pants on, Ermergerd. Whack! I've never had that. Yeah. I've never had that sensation ever before. Ever. Yeah, we're going to take this guy to a field and kick his ass, or what are we going to do? Serial killer. The beautiful parts of the city, actually, are the countryside, the woods around. It's drab in the middle. And adventure you shall have, my friend. Grog and I are just waiting. So Percy at advantage then, right? And I sneak attack Ermergerd. Pommel side, pommel side! I'm gonna Kynan him. Natural 20! Not with the pommel side, man! Thank you. 86. Yes. Hits. Mm-hm. It was his idea! This is literally the third time we have done this. This was a-- -- Grog whispering to Vax thing, on a walk. Yeah, we're not trying try to ditch them. I'm just saying. It wasn't an announced thing. (choking noise) Big 11. (laughs) That's my friend. I bring my hand around the back of his head, and I'm gonna use my action to cast Lay on Hands and dump all 15 hit points into the back of his head. Then I'm going to use Disengage and hop back away from him and say-- Oh, no! Before I hop back and say we are a bunch of fucking assholes and this is all you are going to get with us. Are you sure? And then use Disengage to roll back. Yeah, but I have my movement plus-- Yes, back. 30 feet. No, no, no-- You have a massive headache. I just wanted to get him to unconscious. If I'm not a master assassin-- How can I not go (thu-kunk) and not-- Right. Right, right. Okay. Did I make it clear that I was trying to do this to Sam and not Tary? (all laugh) Ooh. That's terrible. Whoa. You find out afterwards. Oh my God. Oh my God, he is hanging on by a thread. I take both daggers and I shove them in my belt, and I start circling down-- I'm looking at the map-- yeah, that way, and just start talking. Tary. Tary. It's the elf boy. This is what we do, this is what we're gonna be facing, all right? Guys, we're fine, we're fine, that's enough. Are you sure you want to play with us? Because we're going somewhere very dangerous very soon, and they did not play nicely with me. We're about to go to hell with someone who did not deal fairly with me. You can come along, and buddy, let me tell you something, if we get in the middle of the shit, I will protect you, but it is going to be rough. And they're not going to call off their attack like we are. Are you sure you want to write this book and come with us? Are you changing your mind? Oh, wow. The worst place in all the multiverse, and we're gonna let him smack into that for his first time? I walk over. I kneel in front of him and I start massaging where I fucking beaned him. No, no, I have very deft fingers. Because fathers can be assholes. I take him into a gentle headlock and I turn to my sister and say, Ahh, this guy. Now I like this guy. Wait, what are you doing, what are you doing? No. That was terrible tough love, and I'm very sorry. I think you should come with us. I think you should. Do you know something? That fucking gaudy hat you're wearing? I would have no idea how to harness the power of that hat. I don't know shit about shit. All I know how to do is hit people in the back of the head, that's the one skill that I have. You know a lot more than I do. All you lack is experience. Well, I'm worried that we're all going to die in the Nine Hells. Is there? Oh my gosh. We had to beat him to a bloody pulp before we liked him. I mean, honestly, we'd like-- We like fuck-ups. We're a family of fuck-ups, so, you want in or not? There are many ways to help people in need. But first I'd like to suggest a mantra. I don't know if you've ever tried it. It helps for me, it has in the past. Fuck your dad. That's one-- LAURA and You know what I mean, you fucking third-grade assholes, jeepers creepers. We'll see. The other thing is, you've done the impossible. Well, I've taken a shine to you for some reason. Do you wanna shake off the child's play and do the real thing? The truth is, you never stop being afraid. Being brave doesn't mean you stop being afraid, it means you learn to compartmentalize it. You just live with it. So that feeling you're feeling? You're not gonna lose that. Well... This guys absorbs damage, so stick by him. Wow. Can we get this guy drunk, please. Yeah, yes, Percy's right. We really haven't had a barn-burner since we got back from the big do, you know. We should get your sister, we should get Shaun, we should get Allura and Kima and anyone who's in town. Yeah, you know, Tary, there's something you don't really know about-- we've just-- I mean, it's really complicated, it's hard to explain to you, you're an outsider. But we have just lost someone very dear to us. It's very complicated. And maybe we're dealing with shit that is hard, so I'm sorry if we pushed you too hard. I think there was benefit to be had from what just happened, but we're in a shitty headstate. A dear friend is gone, so, apologies. I thought you would go down in one shot, and you were still standing! I mean, clearly we've been fucking with you a little bit, but you have ability and skill, and that's not bullshit. Seriously. Yeah. That will get you-- Yeah! Yes! I believe him, I believe him. (whispers) He's just-- he's fucking with you, it's fine. (normal volume) It's all right. It's all right. Let's go get drunk. Yeah. It's been too long, are you kidding? Oh my gosh, that can go in any direction. Oh, man. We're figuring it out. It's pretty good. It's pretty good. We're gnomeless. (sharp inhale) We just got good. Come here. Tell me more about your father. That's terrible. Drink up, by the way. Really? No. Was there anything good about your upbringing? Any positive points? At the early age of 28? Literally? I mean. What do I mean? I mean, was he the offspring of-- I'm sure he does. Was he married to your mother? So you mean, shithead? All right. There's a lot of backstory here that you're not privy to. Howard. My tattoo? What? The Slayer's Take? That's a fucking Keyleth palm at this point. Yeah, I mean, he's particularly brainy. You guys have a lot in common. I mean, there's a lot of differences between the two of you, but you have a lot in common. Yeah. Huh. You can teach him the art of nerd chic, Percy. Oh, I didn't know that. What do you make of all this? I don't know-- nerd talk? Yeah? What do you think of the new guy? I mean, he's not Scanlan. No. Wait, you need to be the lead character in your death-taunting? Is that what you're telling us? I'm gonna squish in next to him and put my arm around with an ale and say, I don't know why I am suddenly taking a shine to you when I felt like I hated you a couple hours ago. Just stick with us. You don't have to know-- I hear everything you're saying. You're an asshole, and I love you, but you really are an asshole. I'm just talking to the guy. I have taken a shine to you, and I'm gonna look out for you, all right? The first time I got attacked I was a fucking mess. I'm still a fucking mess. That's the thing, people are writing stories about us, we're a bunch of fucking shitheads, and nobody talks about that-- maybe a few people do. A few people do talk about that. There's no way to prepare, you just have to hit your face against the wall a couple of times, then it starts to feel normal-ish. Yeah. You're good, you've done it, you've been hazed, you're good, kid. That's pretty cool. Good night, Tary, good night. Oh, boy. What a babe in the woods. You know, we don't have the weight of the world crushing us at the moment, so I feel like that might have something to do with it, yeah. Once again you're a couple steps ahead of us. I wonder where Scanlan is. I walk over to Grog and start playing-- what was it? Rock, paper, what was it? Trying to teach Grog that game. No? Yeah. Yeah, I think we've got some-- We could go after the dude in hell, but I think we have some more time. I agree, I agree. So.. Ooh. Thanks, Matt. We will live in the stars. Shame! Shame! (laughing) I love you guys. You've done a lot of brilliant things. That was the most brilliant thing you have ever done. Oh my god. Let's do it, let's-- Always have. All right. Eyes on the prize. Tary! That's two times! You've teleported two times. Wow. You lasered in on that like nobody's business! That's a little bit of Los Angeles actor humor for you guys over in Sweden today. For all you fans in Germany, that's a little San Fernando valley humor! Yeah, she's got the big teeth. (sing-song) Rock Caller Dryden And I'm watching her stride through here with confidence, just impressed. Jerry! Jerry! Ticonderoga... pencils. What's up, buddy? Yeah? That's true. Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes. Yeah. That's-- you're welcome, that's good. That's good. One step at a time. Yeah. What? Are you asking me if he shit here? What are you talking about? I walk off. I'm not getting part of this. Have some volcanic ash. Kiki, what do you think? Are we staying here for the night, or-- I mean, we just got here, it's the middle of the day, isn't it? We need to make camp? You need to rest? Or can we go now? You are feeling the boat over the airship? I know, but you practically sang ballads for airships for weeks. So one and done, all right. I'm on a boat! What does that mean? White. Your boating shoes, I'm sure, are very white. Yes. Ooh, no. What is going on? Damn it! Son of a bitch. I mean either way, he can make it work, right? Don't leave me hanging up top. Woo! Boats. Seems dodgy. She was busy doing push-ups on that cruise. Ter the dercks! Yeah. I'll back you up. Me too, me too. 18. Oh, you've done me in by one. One. Abban. Sure. Ah, that's complicated. We're hoping for a bit of a discount for the group that is responsible for this city still existing. Give it a second, please. Doubting Thomas. (sighs) Do your fucking thing, whatever. (all laugh) I do! I do! They're necessary all the time. All the time! Except when it comes-- --to me. Go, go, do your thing. Do your thing. I'm gone. Yep. Yeah, yeah, whatever, Matthew, whatever. What roll? There's protein in everything. Everything. It's true. Hespit-bound. That's nothing for us. Vex'ahlia. We have so-- Hey, buddy? There's a lot of-- -- inner working dynamics in this group that you don't know anything about-- If you'd just wait a bit, all right? That sounds good. What d'you mean? You got-- you got nothing? We have, we were just way high above it. I'm afraid of getting nauseous, actually. Drensala Vis. Drensala Vis! Mother Lucker. Too many mother luckers! That'll help in the middle of the ocean. Yeah. You don't wanna drop the iPhone in the toilet. What do you mean? You can spend days on a ship. Tary, there wo-- what is that in reference to? It would make for a good beginning of a chapter to set out at dawn. Little elf boy? Well... I mean-- We've really been through the shit, so I'm not opposed. Just saying. How many bunks per room? That's weird. No, it's weird. I disagree. Well, you're fucked. Yeah. Fuck it. Oh, jeez. Tary, staring off into the distance, shat his pants. Crying, into his poo-- No, I'm as smart as you thought I was. Everybody's vomiting. I'm on a boat! Almost, almost. Getting there. What an episode.
