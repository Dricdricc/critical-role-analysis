Taliesin, when did you get here?! I am going to see how long I can last with these fuckers in. Yeah, I know. If I can talk with a southern accent, I'm fine. But other than that, I ain't good. So I'll give you about ten minutes before these suckers come out. Hold on, let me check my Pip Boy. Yep. That's the worst Q-Bert cosplay I've ever seen. I've had bad dreams about this. And you are dressed for success. I am so excited. We picked the texture and the color and the design for the d20! I have a dagger and a feather crossed into an X. Who likes books? Except books from Tor Books! Taliesin, may I use the V.A.T.S. system this evening? This was a Nerf gun that I got on Etsy, painted by some charming fellow or a lass. Oh, the teeth are coming out. I cannot do the whole night with the teeth, no way. We've done that many episodes? Thanks, Pac-Murderer. Oh my god, yeah! Sagas of Sundry Madness! Came out. There's too much extra shit with them! Too much wax. I'll try again another year. Yeah, Sagas of Sundry Madness. Ivan led us on a fucking wild ride and scared the shit out of me a little bit, initially. Came together real good. Real good. Should definitely try it. It's on Project Alpha now. Oh, it was nerve-wracking! And it's Halloween, so it's timely. Why do you think the Mercers went around the planet? They're kicking it in Australia right now, having a blast. Big math night. Not even thinking about it, I'm just taken by how handsome you look tonight. Don't worry about going gray, because it's working. I feel fancy as fuck. Yeah, we got a map tonight, so we're fine. There's Geek & Sundry right there. There's the Burbank Airport. Let me check my data. Oh, it's all the secrets! Oh nope! There's one last little thing. Starting next week, we're going to be doing a last, final round of Vox Machina character playlists. Whoa. Not everybody's ready. Mine is ready, so we'll start with me. Probably Keyleth after that, and then we'll figure out from there. Well, you've got about three or four weeks to figure that out. I think he was a vamp. LAURA and And Gary Gygax, beloved for inventing our cherished game. I'm a snaggle tooth now. I just took one out, sure. For now. I'll change it, it'll be different teeth at different times. Sometimes there will be none, sometimes there will be both. Let's make it none. And Gygax had very long protruding fingers, like obscenely long fingers, right? I don't know. I talk into a can for a living, I don't know. I saw The Lost Boys, that doesn't tell me anything about vampires. It's in the movies. Guys, we are going to die or undie or something, can we focus in on what are we going to do? Dani's dead. Does my iPhone have any service? This is a really character-heavy question. Does anyone have an extra pencil? No! You should probably do that obfuscate thing that you've talked about. Is above sealed? Help me visualize what's above us. So we're not getting any firelight or anything? I'm not seeing anything. Definitely Sam or Laura or Travis should go ahead. Let the brain hang back and figure shit out, right? She's got this. That's like here to the door out to the-- I mean, you're not really human anymore, you're kind of tough now. I'll be 51 feet behind. Yessir. Not doing a good job of quelling the serial killer thing, Sam. She doesn't either. You don't eat rats? What do you mean? Sofa king. We can but, yeah, let me pitch something here. Like we're all tired. We have day jobs. I am. That's not what I'm talking about, I mean in general. We got day jobs. We got night jobs. We work a lot. We could be princes and queens of death now. Husbo, you are two hours into being a vampire, if that. You just learned how to run, who knows what else you're going to learn? That's hot. Did I kill that guy? Did I kill Max when I ate him? Who was it? That's the worst thing to say dressed like PacMan. And also I'm really shy and awkward right, but as a vampire it can only get better, right? I mean, I am. There might be underground lakes in here. Okay. So we're not Nazgul. Jeez, all kinds of things are changing now. Yeah we've got to progress our lives, our unlives further so we can't stay here arguing whatever we're going to do. I want to be a vampire. I'm fucking in. I'm not hiding this from you, Travis. I'm not hiding anything from you. We'll bring you around. I'll give it a shot. Like an Otter Pop. Let's read the handwriting. A perception and awareness. That's not bad. That's not bad. Let's see. I did really well in school. Except that's cocked. I should just take the six. So I got an X, I got a one on the red, and an eight. One, two, three. Three successes and one-- Yeah. It says skanktuary. That is disgusting. I'll wait for a person, thanks. This says "Sanctuary." And we know that shit was going on in this building for a while before we were let in on it. So I don't know. Maybe a hideout that's been under here for a while that we didn't know? While vamps were getting-- Yes you are. I will. Okay, Laura's going first. Listen, when I was a teenager in New Jersey, my first job was working for the Department of Public Works, no joke, and we cleaned up after homeless folk, okay. Can I try and read the hobo code? Yeah. Okay. Ooh! Okay. Yeah, we cleaned up and once I found some nasty old mattresses with some magazines. Some smelly things. Right underneath Hamilton Park. Oh, no. One success. Only one success and one failure on a blood die. I didn't roll that. Yeah. Like dirty magazines on a mattress, that's worse. It is taking me home, though. It's good, I'm going to leave it behind, because I've got a new future now. Why do you look like that? What's wrong with you? I'm backing away. There will be brawl. I'm following, too, but not that fast. You guys doing okay down there? Good call. I've been listening in and I come in and say What about this? And I use Presence Awe on him. Sure am. What do I roll? Charisma plus persuasion is all it says. All right. Well, charisma plus persuasion? Ooh, I failed it. Wow, there are a lot of failures tonight. Yeah. Two successes, and one failure on a blood die. A lot of failures on a fucking blood die. Yeah? Do you work in the business? Bottom line, we don't mean you any harm, I mean, we're hungry, but you're not really our-- You're not our diet. Just the basics. If you take the vampire teeth out. Taliesin, did my glamor work? Don't know. All right. You're not Nerdist. I mostly know Geek & Sundry. Before we do we're idiots, right? We're brand new. Obviously, there's been some sort of peace between above and below, and we just want to facilitate that, right? It's hot in here, so if you could keep doing that. How big are we talking? Like an NFL stadium? I was just in one. Are you not allowed in there, Lock? Same. Taliesin's brother. Are you sure? Okay. If you insist. Only if you insist. My normal place. How big is the house? How many seats? Specifically lizard men? I step forward and begin to talk using Presence Awe again. Which is charisma. So I roll a single blood die? That's a two. I'm at four. I'm real hungry, lizard. Two. We mean no disrespect or harm, and are in awe of what you have built here. We have wandered down by accident due to calamity and we are children of the night in the purest sense. And we ask for patience and empathy for the unwise. I'll go further. We are in fear and awe of this council. No fucking joke. And all we want is safe passage and understanding. We don't mean to subvert or cause problems. Merely to survive. He doesn't speak for all of us. Might be too soon for a jump right away. Sam, this is like Being John Malkovich. You're not the real John Malkovich. This is like a pretend John Malkovich. John Malkovich playing a pretend John Malkovich. We'll pretend you aren't super keen. Yeah. You look like a serial killer. Well, I'm not going to fluff us up. We don't know much but we did come in contact with some sort of vampire lord. They all burned up. The airport, subways, lizard colonies. There's always one guy. Is he as old as the rest? I mean, how much is the iguana talking about IRAs and shit? And also, do you have any human prisoners down here or anything? I'm a good talker these days. These hours. If I could maybe eat? Gratefully. No, yeah. (whispering) That's what I'm talking about, Travis! Yeah, Sam! Yeah! This feels great! I mean, I'm hungry, but we get to spend time together for fucking ever! They've got internet. Question. Have you heard AllWorkNoPlay? Any episodes? You've got nothing. You've got nothing! Is it one of these smiles? Which leads to Los Globos? They're not typical, though? Gross. Guys, so, careful. I do not want to get Mercer-ed. Or you guys, but especially me. Let's go. Worse, but Mercer-ed seems easier to happen. So the pyramid goes all the way to the top? Flying squirrel. See, vampires are fucking awesome. Your husband can fly. My husband can run. What are you doing? You're trying to turn into a bat? Oh my god. Do it. You feel it, but it stays up inside. And we're all in the top of this ziggurat? (yelling) Travis! Blam! I'll give you a boost, but how are we all going to--? Okay. This comes naturally. Do you still have that cable? So one of us boosts the other up, drops the cable. Don't dick me. It's got to. I mean, neither of us are Willingham. I could try. It's not going to be pretty. Thousands of feet away! We're at the top of a ziggurat looking at the ceiling! Yeah, Lock, can you boost my friend? Don't offer to Mahlo. Mahlo, come here. Let me find a Sharpie. I write on his arm, "VAX ///" Let's go. I'm not, but that's what I did. I'm not at all. And I step on Sam's back and I jump. I'm not talking about the character sheet. Dex athletics, okay. Ooh, well, one success on a blood die, and one fail on a non-blood die. Same shit? Yeah. Two successes. Yeah, boys, can you help my friend up? You're so big in a small space. Seven. We're within a mausoleum, or something? A metal gate? That we can see through? Is there any writing in here? I duck behind one of the coffins. Okay, that's fine. Now that's happy. Is it a goth party? I'm looking for loners. Whatever. I'm already gone. I'm looking for somebody on their own. I'm looking for an antelope away from the herd. Sure. Sure. I'm into it. So I look for one of the porta-potties that's got the little circle turned to red, right? Yeah. (knocking) I forcibly yank it open. Yeah, you know how shitty porta-potties are built? I'm pretty sure this is the one thing I could break open. The one thing. Sure. Oh, that's going to be shitty. Strength. Ooh, what do I--? I have more blood die than strength and brawl combined. All blood die? Word. One fail. Yeah, sorry, man, it's uncalled-for. I'm sorry. I'm going to wait until he's done. I'm waiting in line, and as soon as the door opens, as soon as I hear k-chunk, I'm yanking it open and pushing in. I'm biting. Yeah. As soon as that door's open. Of course! I'm so hungry. Oh no, I need another blood die. That's great. Three successes, one failure. The successes are on blood die. Yeah, I'm going. I don't care, I'm so fucking hungry right now. What happens if I wanted to use Dread Gaze on this person? But I risk more hunger, right? No, I'm not going to do that yet. What do I do? Okay. Two successes and one failure. Yes, wait, what did I roll? It's brawl plus something plus two, you said, right? So I actually rolled too many die. Two successes, one failure. Same thing. Yeah, we're in, already! Nobody can see us in here! They probably think we're macking. Well, I'm new at this, so I don't know. If I keep going, do I get fed more? Let's top off. Well, I don't know what that means, but yes. Let's top off. Yes. Yes I do. And do I give you any of these blood die? All of them? There you are. Who is this person, now that I have a moment? I'm shoving him down through the toilet seat, in, in, in. Friedle is into the blue. Will, what are you doing here, really? What are you doing here? I don't care. I feel so good. Being a vampire is the fucking best! Diplomatic immunity. Do it. Didn't apologize to Friedle. Have you been around the last five years? I come waltzing up. Oh my god, I just did a bump of Friedle. I mean, I just bumped into Friedle. It's crazy, the odds. Yeah! He's here! No, he is not a vampire. He had to go. (sucking noise) Sure. Ridiculous! This is very serious. The eyebrows though... Marinating right now. Who's going to find it? You don't know about his body. What's Los Globos? But what does it mean? G.L.A.B.O.S.? Can I get a drink out of habit? SAM and We don't? There's nothing in my pants anymore? Just all my shit? I'll just say, hey, how's the night going? Jeez, you have a big smile. I know that's weird to say. No, I have a friend with a, it's dumb, but a huge smile. Like teeth as big as the Hollywood sign. Gorgeous. Yeah, what's good tonight? Oh god. I would love an absinthe, but I lost my wallet. I guess just beer on tap. Could I leave a card? God, I don't have that. God, I am up shit creek. It's no question that the three of you want me to fail. It's fine. I'm used to it. Yes I am. I'm used to it, Laura. Don't worry. Three. Okay, cool. Good thing I drained Friedle. I never did Presence Awe. For getting that hunger. Yep, sure. Just one success, no failures. Absolutely. I mean, I gotcha. That is what we're here for. Do you see the guy over there with the gigantic smile that looks like Pac-Man with the huge teeth? Yeah. That's my guy. He was newly christened tonight and the rest of us want to celebrate. I do want to see the cocktail list. Just drop it at the front? Okay. Sure. All right. Could I get an Old Fashioned? Would that be all right? Just for old times' sake. Every once in a while, I remind myself what I left behind. What does that taste like? Yeah. Better off. Please tell me it's Lauryn Ipsum. Humanity is in the porta potty with Friedle right now. Losing one finger is not the worst. Secret messages. I'm sure. I guess I'll show up at the bottom of the stairs now, too. I wasn't there for that. Laura! I feel like you're really unsafe up there without me. Yes, I did as I was crossing through. Absolutely. I saw the altercation. Love you! Thanks. I mean, are we supposed to be referencing films for this? Book series? The music doesn't really change too much. Got it. Who's on the fringes that stands out? Hey. We're a little-- And hey, yeah. Yeah. We're unlikely, I know. It's pretty good though. Then join me. TALIESIN and Yeah, that happened. Is that how it normally goes down? Special menu? Oh man, that's so gauche. Yeah, we're civilized. Yes. Fucking A. What would the Briarwoods do? Like a side car? Is all the energy vampiric? Does it? Because I want some of that. Okay. I'm still riding high on Friedle. I start dancing. It all sums back to Gary Gygax. Yeah. Yuri, I'm so sorry. I've got questions. When I met you in '99, 2000, were you already? In Princeton, New Jersey? So this is somewhere between-- And what about-- offspring is like Alucard? Like halfsies? Some of us ate rats. I'm clean as a whistle. We are ready to learn. Spill it, girl. Spill it. We're getting ahead of ourselves. Yuri, what's the deal? Yeah, what do we do? All my veins are noticeably large so I don't think I have a problem. Nothing's wrong with Liam's face. I've been like that for years, man! Yeah. Billy Mays here for vampirism! Babe, does it hurt? But in a bearable way? Yeah, they don't like it here. Yuri Lowenthal is a popular actor in both games and animation. Geek and Sundry is in rubble. It's destroyed. Marisha Ray is gone. You need someone to rebuild the studio and lead it creatively and while I have no experience-- I use Presence Awe. Yes. I'll use it on Erika. No, Erika and I, we bonded on Dread. I will use it on Erika. You and I, Erika, will rebuild Geek and Sundry. We will create a nest of creativity and vampirism like the undead have never seen. Charisma plus persuasion. Two successes, one failure. Nothing on the blood die. Remember those two days on Madness and how fucking cool it was? Erika. The magic we had, the theatre we had-- (strained) You want to help me, Erika? (strained) Who is it? (strained) I'm clearly out-classed here. (strained) Felicia, I'm a big fan of Dr. Horrible, big fucking fan of Dr. Horrible. I get it. Tough love. We're ready. (normal voice) I use Awe again. Presence Awe again. (strained) That's right. I do. Loyal as the day is long. Okay. Three successes, no failures. Ten thousand years of Day. And not the bad kind. (strained) You were supposed to protect me! (laughter) As we're dying, I reach my hand and finds Sam's. As we're fading away (dying voice) Why is our life so ridiculous? There was no Taliesin in the champagne room. He's here, tonight? May have. Wow. I'll see you in your dreams, Friedle.
