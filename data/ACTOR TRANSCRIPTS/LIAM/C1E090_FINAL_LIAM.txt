Man. Joma, your time is over! Druids don't shave pits, man. To be fair, so is Percy. Happy St. Pat's. That's the end of the episode, right? It is an April Fools' joke. Bring 4,000 of your closest friends. You don't have that, do you? He's got guns attached now! Gatling gun! It shoots bees! I kind of remember people going through that. You know well that my heart lies with them. Both of them. All of them. But I have put my faith in you. And I await your word. Yeah. (coughs) Yeah. I know. Eventually. I've everything I need. We get an extra hour. Yes. You ready for the day? You're a born leader. Come on. I reach in front of the boys and grab a big fistful. Oh, yeah, Grog. You have the best voice of all of us. I like that this is our breakfast entertainment. He posted on Instagram six weeks ago and that was it. A happy ranch hand in the-- We're laughing at ourselves. We haven't thought of this guy in 72 years! Yeah. My breakfast is not tasting as good. Yeah, you up for it? They put antlers on the antlers. We haven't seen a base mimic before. In this game? I don't remember it. Ooh, shizz-nap! That I remember, yeah. Does that jive with your hometown, though, Kiki? Dressing up? It's like a kilt that's barely joined at the bottom already. It's like a poopy diaper. It literally is a poopy diaper. Well, we're in town. We've got this book and a library, but we should decide what we're going to do tomorrow. What's to wait? Why don't we go home? You are adorable right now. Yeah. Does the Tempest go on road trips? Oh. What do you know about that? She does read a lot. Or she used to. Are you sharing a library? Yeah, yeah. I don't need to hear about it. Oh, that's a big decision for you to make, I think. Everybody else believes in you. Why shouldn't you? They're both handicapped, aren't they? What's Westruun like? Pittsburgh? Yeah, I like it! We could also Tree Stride to Vasselheim for the fanciest of shopping. If you want to go all-out. First there was the dinosaurs. I want to go to there. Does that regenerate and come back? Is it one time only? They don't like magic. I mean, I am really good at disguises. I haven't flexed those muscles in a while, but-- I can work with a little bit of nose putty, and yeah, I can make a fake face for this guy. So do I. I feel really rusty. What do we want this guy to look like? Should we turn him into a goliath, then? Stealth cloak? Do you have a stealth cloak? I'm going to need your help because I'm not used to working on robots. You can make some mesh work, right? And we can get some clay, and some spectacles like yours, but maybe shaded. Yeah? Yeah. I have made masks for myself. We don't have to, I mean-- Hey, give me some money. I don't have any money. I never have money. This is the first time in this entire goddamn campaign-- Yes, it is. Give me some fucking money. I want her money. Thanks. I throw myself off of things for this one, she can't give me 50 gold pieces. Thank you. It's a party! Hey, Matt? Do I have this ability? I feel like I remember it, but I'm looking through-- I have Imposter, right? That's me, can I use it on a robot? Oh, we're doing it. And I've always had a disguise kit. Because I did something back in the home game, I did something. No? This is five times that. Well, that is a 20. No, not a natural 20. Get me ten sets of scissors. I need you to make a rig, like in a video game. Can you do that? Oh my god, where's Shorthalt when you need him? Is the hair curly or straight? Wavy, okay. I thought you were going to go Ronald McDonald, so that's a step up. Oh, good gods! What did you make, what did you do? I mean, it's bad. It's really bad. It's a start. I think the hair will actually help the molding clay stay in place. (sighs) All right. We collectively are Dr. Frankenstein. Let's make this happen. No, I think that'll help-- -- it'll help hold all it in place. Oh my God. Oh, all right. I'm going to try to make this a-- What number do I use for the disguise kit? Dexterity? Because I'm a rogue. Oh, my gods. I don't think so. I mean, I don't know, so I'm just going to say no. Dexterity. Okay. All right, I'm going to go for like, a General Krieg-type look to the face? I'm going to do my best-- -- to redheaded General Krieg? Okay, here we go. I'm going to use Luck. I'm going to use Luck. Yeah. I'm quite sure. Natural 20! General Krieg, it's good to see ya! Yeah. Guys, art is subjective, all right? Put clothes on top of this thing and we're golden, I think. Happy St. Patrick's Day, everybody! Good teamwork. Yeah. Well, good work. I knock on the side of its head. That's not Krieg. Yeah, but Grog, we glued it on. We Dorked with it. Yes, he's a disguised robot. Mostly Keyleth. What? Got all your hair-- Where is the hair from? Did you pull it like a patch off and it turns into a bunch of hair? God, magic is amazing. That'll do all right. Wait there's glue on the-- -- on the elven cloak? Oh. Oh, that-- Much sentimental value-- It's all right, you're still alive. Whoop-dee-doo. Let's just do the thing, come on. Oh, man. What-- You've seen what I can do with hair, right? I mean, are you really surprised? Clasp time, Clasp time. Let's use that save point. Library. Do we want to split up? You want to go talk Orcus? Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna go learn about scary things, though. Tru-- what? As they leave, I spank Grog hard on the ass and say, money was meant to be spent! Well some people go this way, and some people go that way and some people go both ways! Yeah. That guy. Mm? She does. Yeah, I mean, that's a whole thing, I don't think that's a bad idea, but I feel like if I go there, I need to stay for a bit. Yeah. No, not yet. Let's do that. We're going to talk about the book. We're going to ask them if they can destroy it. Preferably destroy. It's dangerous. NECromancy. (laughs) Does that name mean anything to you? Research? We came to Vasselheim to dispose of it. My sister has read it. Parts of it, and-- It's foul. It should not be allowed to exist. What happens after you research it? Has that vault ever been disturbed in its entire history? Oh, I'm sorry, we weren't clear. We came to discuss it. We don't have it now. And all these many months, you've been in possession of the horn you have? What have you learned of the one you do have? We need to discuss a few things, but we'll fetch the tome. It's already made one attempt. It's only a matter of time. Or fit in? No big. Thank you for your time. I pull Vex into an alleyway. (sighs) I don't know what the right thing to do is. I thought one thing going in there. And now I think maybe you were right. I have not wanted to go to that temple, though. She has finally been speaking to me again. When I died, I saw her. I have dreamed of her already. And she speaks of some sort of purpose on the horizon. And I don't know if she's talking about your promise you made, or what. But she is with us. And I barely know what the fuck I'm doing, but I know that she doesn't want that book to exist. And, honestly, I am frightened of going to that temple because I want time. I want time with you, I want time with Keyleth, I want time. And I don't want to lose that time now, I want to be selfish for a little while. We've been working so fucking hard, by all rights we should be dead. Well, I don't know. I don't know. And look at this. And I start to unbuckle the front of my chest-- Relax, look at this. I don't know. I don't know. I think so. Hurts a little bit. Not really, no. I cover it back up. But I think you are right, and I think that they're going to hold that, and someone will take it, whether it's in a hundred years or a thousand years, and she doesn't want it and-- Yeah, they already have that. They don't have this. All right. Yes. It was going great. That's some Name of the Rose shit right there. Then an escalator! I think I've read it says you keep the same intellect, though, right? No, he was a genasii. The succubus. And that thing with the bones. In Krieg's house. Saviors of the universe, we are. While he's skimming could we jump back for just thirty seconds? Just 30 seconds before we go in, I'm like I should have the book. I'll carry the book in, give me the book. I don't carry books. You took the book when we left-- Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck. Yeah. (all laugh) (sing) We built Dis city on-- Great stealth roll. Thank you. Holy shit. Can I have that book please? I'm just going to hold on to that. Are we tabling the book, then? A little too interested for my taste. Yes. I don't want this book in anyone's hands, frankly. Do we want this book to travel to hell? I'll tell you what. Why don't you guys get everything set to go, and I will drop this off. Yeah, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. Do you want to come with me? I hook him by the arm and we just start off. Love you! This ain't New York City. Yeah. No. I suspect you've been here before. (sighs) I like that things are better between you and I now. Do you know what I like? I like the version of you that my sister brings out. (clears throat) Come on. Hello there. You recognize me. This is my friend. We bring you an offering for the Queen. She has begun to speak to me. Her desires are not clear, entirely, but I am listening. And I intend to learn. We have to go. But I mean to come back. (whispers) Good day. Look over my shoulder at the temple as we walk. Come on, let's get drunk. (laughs) Scoop and lift. No. I need a drink, have you had one already? I'm fine. Yeah? LAURA and Freddie. Order me something that rich people drink. Is that it? I've done beer. Yeah! This one tells me that you have the goods, so I want the goods. Want the goods. We're in a bar, you fucker. Buy me a drink, you asshole. I've saved your life like three times. Mm. Hm. That's all? It's a stirge. But did the disguise work? Are you sure they were dead? Are they just fucked up? Is there a mop anywhere in the room? In this room? No. What about drapes on the windows? Insight check Grog. Well, that's a one. I'm not wasting Luck on it. Jeez, man. Did they attack you? Why? Were you in danger? Why? What a clusterfuck. Was there no other choice? Please, save us from this moral dilemma! We are skipping past the fact that two men are dead right now. Do we need to go and find them? And try to-- This is upsetting. Of course he did, he looked us in the eye and he said he killed two people! We should go find them. (laughs) That's it. Where was this place? Where was this place? We have to find these two men and bring them to a temple or something, we can't just leave them-- Can you guide me there? Look, listen, take me to this place. You and I will carry these men to a temple. We will-- what happened to me? Well, I can't do that. And you can't do that, so we need to take these men to a temple where somebody can help them! So those guys aren't dead, is what you're saying? Those two guys are not dead? LAURA and All right, that's kind of funny. What is better in this town? A disgusting mess or a robit? An automaton. An ottoman. Oh, great. We left without the book, thinking we had the book, and then we lied about not having the book, but we actually didn't have it. I start peeling it away. This is so fucking terrible. I'm so angry. (all laugh) Does the cloak of Elvenkind look like butt? It worked? You buy the potions, we pay for the shitty hotel rooms. No. No time like the present. It's too late, it's black. (all laugh) What happens now, boss? Ow. No it's fine, I feel good. I feel really good. Yeah, I feel really good. I feel rested. I feel fucking healthy man. I don't know. I'm serious. (growls) In all the hubbub and the movement, a few moments before, I've been watching for Korren, and when I see him alone for a second, I make a beeline toward him. Forgive me. Might I have just a moment? I will be brief. I just wanted to take a moment to say, I really wish you could've seen some of the things she has done. I know you are proud of her. I've never met anyone like her. She's going to do your people very proud. I'm grateful. You've a lot to do. It's all right. It's more than I ever got. Died in Stillben, game three.
