Can you scoot the whole bench down on this side? Grab this unicorn by the horn. That is manly. Oh my gosh, 'critrole' is the code you need for free shipping if you want Wyrmwood Gaming boxes to hold your dice in them. We all have them. I have some at home. My kids love them. Critrole is the code you need for free shipping. His character is small, but he has a big personality. The violins go south. That we see. 38. Hot, hot, hot. The honest gnome. Can I attack on her heels when she's done? 60 feet. That's my distance. They're all grouped together? All right, so I'm going to throw at that one as well. I'm just going to throw one, and just to check, I'm hidden, yeah? So this is Assassinate, I have advantage because it hasn't gone yet, and it's a crit because I'm surprising it. 25. Are they pets? Are they friends? Where were you-- You have to be around, though. To keep an eye on them. Well, listen, when we see these things without an owner around, we take them out, I'm sorry, it's pretty standard. Our lives are so bizarre now. It's dangerous around us, I don't know-- Your dead things don't stealth, I would assume? Shit. Back to normal, then, eh? Whoa whoa whoa! First word. Two syllables. And roll bad. So it's the earlier. Super duper! And I mean, Gern was shouting. I think that's the portal they were trying to-- Hey, DM! You said they were ripping open the portal? Where is that on the map? Way back, okay. 16. Carl! Bob and weave, Fatty, bob and weave! All right, so I rev up the Boots of Haste and I'm going to run right next to Vex'ahlia, on the very edge of the map. And the fire elemental there's right up against Percy, right? All right. I'm going to stab him three times in his fire buttocks. First one is a 27. Second one is a 16. Third is a 14. Hits, okay. So, first one's sneak attack, so, shite. An eight-- I'll add that on at the end. Here come the dice. Two, four, seven, ten, 16, 21, 27, 28. 28 plus two is 30, 36, for that first with sneak attack damage. Second dagger does seven, and third swipe does nine. Yes. That sounds delightful. Y'all want to go to the DQ and get a cone of cold? Is it going to play with us? Oh, don't burn your foot. Ooh! You're running at them. What? Don't we have company incoming? 34. Maybe they see something behind us. 20. ErmahGern! So tired. I was thinking it. I got a high stealth right beforehand, so am I hidden at the moment? As far as I know. All right. Balls. I'm just going to throw three daggers at the salamander, right from where I am. Yeah, okay, so. First is a 20, second is a 14, third is a 19. 20. And if I'm hidden it's a surprise, right? On that guy? You tell me. Okay, I thought it was a-- okay, great! Fine. Love it. Okay, so. All right. No, and other one, no. So, four, eight, 12, 13, 16, 20, 31, 35 for the first. And the second one is a ten. I'm going to move. I'm going to skip to my right and stand behind Grog and spank him on the ass and say go get 'em, tiger. They're like Charlie Brown Christmas trees? Thanks for coming, thanks for playing. You're still on fire, by the way. And is it a good witch, or a bad witch? Sorry, Matt. Sorry, Matt. Can we all collectively look up at him, look sad, and go, aw. All right, I'm going to scoot up right in front of Keyleth on the edge of the frozen-over pool of lava, but I'm not going to stand on it. And I'm going to chuck three daggers at the salamander in front of Grog. Right in front of her. Between her and the-- yeah. There. One, two, three to the salamander. 21. Then 25. And then 21. All right, and because he's flanked by Grog, the first one gets sneak attack damage. Two plus eight, 14, 16, 17, 22, 23, 25, 31 for the first. And then ten for the second and eight for the third. I look over my shoulder at Keyleth like a dumb schmuck for a second, and then back at the salamander. That means that existence is about to end. Just roll this. Roll another one. It's a rookie rogue mistake. It happens in the beginning. At the higher levels you mess up the assassinate thing. She just hit a sparrow on a paraglider. Oh. Well, half good, half bad. Right now, on the air. 15, she said 15. Oh jeez. Here it comes. Oh, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead! This is the time. Roll the d10, add it. You're also 60 feet apart at the moment. The gnome has got this. Love you, Scanlan. I ship Scanlan and Gern. It's still very romantic, though. My name is Vax. Kismet. As if this were a Telltale game, at the top of the screen it says, 'Keyleth will remember this'. You don't want to fuck with his beard! Sorry, Laura. Does he spin the globe? Man, all right. I'm in a good spot, I'll just throw three more daggers at the salamander that Grog has not yet killed. First one is a natural 20, the second one is a 13, and the third one is, aw, fuck, is a 14. Five, six, seven, eight, 12, 18, 21, 25. 25, so you double the dice, is 56 for the first one. Grog, how did you do that? Does anyone have a large purple hand they could use? He's over lava. Yes? Scanlan, how much time do we have with this bubble? Grog, Grog! Stop trying to reanimate that thing and hit the freaking red guy into the hole! 20. Get it. Get it. Reanimate that fucker. Grog, shove that fucking thing in there. You are made of hit points! Crap. He's mad. These assholes. Oh, shite. All right, I'm going to leap over the lava pit. Yeah. That'll be a 28. I run up behind Grog, and I should be within-- All right, right behind Grog. I should be within 60 feet of the efreeti. And I'll throw three daggers at it. First one is a 34. Second one is a 27. Third is a 29, so they all hit. But there's no sneak attack on these-- I don't know anymore. I rolled really high, and I rolled my attack bonus, like a 19 plus 11? A 30? I don't know. Math looked right when I did it. There's no subterfuge, it might be stupidity. First one's a ten, second one was a ten, and the third one is a seven. 79! That's a big one, we've seen that happen. The giants got disintegrated. Get the fucker, you dirty bastard. Get the other nipple, now? He just took 100 points of damage. Here comes the cube. You did it again! Yeah, girl. Come on, Vex. Come on, sister. Get it. A what? Is that like a magic candle? I don't understand sorcery at all. Strange that you would say that. Run, Coral, run! There's something I could do. I whip the Cape of the Mountebank out of my pocket and run at that door and jump off the edge and just try to balloon umbrella it down over with that red cape. I'm doing it. I'm matadoring it. Okay. That is a 25. Cross your fingers, everybody. No bonuses here. So what does that mean? Advantage. That's better. That is 13. Hot hot hot hot hot. The Deathwalker's Ward is set to fire. No no no no no no no no! Where am I, am I near her, on the ground? Okay, I look at the skeleton, I look at her. I look at the skeleton, I look at her. I'm an idiot. I'm pretty bad. Is that the finger? Or is that the finger? Wow. Did I stutter? I sidle up next to my sister and stand there for a moment and deadpan say, boy, the more things change, the more they stay the same. And then I walk away. (laughter) Yeah. It's all right, it's only been a couple of years. CritterStrong. Don't worry, everyone will judge you when you take it out and use it for the first time. Beat him by one.
