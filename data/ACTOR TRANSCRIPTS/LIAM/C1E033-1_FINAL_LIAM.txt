Endlessly charming. We got a big fat care package from Kurtis Wiebe, who is the writer of Rat Queens, so we have collected volumes. I think the first volume or two of Rat Queens. There's some t-shirts, so some of that will probably be finding its way in. Obviously, we love Rat Queens. I just tweeted out links to the store from the @criticalrole twitter handle. You are now Homer Simpson in hell with donuts just going in. (laughter) Switched over to PayPal. While he looks at that, one last thing. We are, as always, friends with Wyrmwood Gaming. If you want beautiful wooden boxes in all kinds of colors and patterns, go to Wyrmwood Gaming, and if you use the code CritRole, you will get free shipping. You'll get free shipping. Hey, one nerd helping out another. I brought this for good luck today. (laughter) We're off the rails again. Yes. He's in Mr. Mom! He's in Mr. Mom. This guy right here. Terrible teeth. How close together are the bars to this cell? Four inches. Well, no. I'm not saying for you not to, but would I be able to comfortably throw through? Yeah? All right. I'm not telling you not to. Passive-aggressive much? And just as he finishes talking, I throw a dagger a foot away from her head in the wall. All right. I come out of the shadows. I pull out a pick and I walk up to the gate and I say, he's a very good shot. She's a very good shot. This guy, I've watched turn things into the Jelly of the Month, so I would tread very carefully. She's a nervous laugher. (laughter) All right, I'm going to use Luck. It's not that bad. That's a 20. Yeah, because of my-- Skadoosh. Wait. One sec. This never happens. (laughter) Shut up! We're still very tough. (laughter) Kill him! Let's go parading through the castle. I just want to see if I sense anything around. 23. Perception, yeah. I'm following my sister in, doing the buddy cop thing. So close. Before my sister leaves, I grab her by the arm and say, "Listen to me--" (creaking) I walk out ahead of her. (whispering) Goodbye, Pike. I watched him do that, and I shrug and I reach into my pack, and I throw 30 more of them. I lean my head in and say, the goliath could turn your head into paste now, if you like. See you later. I go stealth. 20. No, 23. I'm off sitting in the shadows, but I say, Percival, we need to cut off the head. I start running towards the direction that was described. As I'm moving, by the way, it's minor, but I take out Clarota's (sniffs, groans) metallic cap and put it on, and I also whip out this other cloak that I've been looking at and whip it around. You're not here. And now continue on. Yes, all right, excellent. It's fine. There's two things. Moving forward. That is 22. Do I need to stealth again, or am I already stealthed? Yeah. It was like 23 before. So I'm going to move toward that sound. Carefully. Okay, I'm sticking my ear to the door, and I'm going to listen for a full minute to see what I hear. I want to gently try the door handle. I want to push it like one inch in and try to peek in. I back up about five steps and very quietly say, Jenga. (laughter) Yeah. What am I looking at? Right. But he's behind her a bit, right? Well, I recently added the sharpshooter feat, so three-quarter and half cover means nothing to me. So I'm going to aim for his eye that's peeking out the side. All three are going right in his eye. So here's the first. The first is 24. Okay, the second is 26. As you can tell, I've been screaming monster sounds. My voice is a little ragged. 26 on the second. And 16 on the third. The first, it's three plus seven is ten. Plus 14, 20, 26, 29, 33, 39. That's the first one. And then the second one does four plus six is ten. Oh! But it's surprise, so the first one is doubled because it's automatically a crit. Well, it was 39, so now it's 60, 78. For the first one. Ten for the second. All right. I'm going to do luck. Yeah. That's a 22. I am running at him and stabbing the shit out of him. I'll use luck again. Yeah. That's 17 for constitution saving throw. Am I able to use evasion for that? So if I succeed, I take no damage. I'm going into his guts. So first attack is a 25, second attack is a 20, and the third attack is a 26. One, two, three? Oh, and I'm going to turn the poison on for the poison dagger, which I'm going to use for the second. Well, it just drips. So nine for the first, eight for the second, plus the poison is-- shit, I didn't copy it down here. I think it's 1d12. Let's say it's 1d12, because I can't remember. If anyone wants to correct me, they can. Five points of poison added to the five is 13. And then the last dagger is nine. Hello. That's it, I'm out. We're six seconds in, Taliesin. Wisdom, which I have advantage. That is a 20. Oh, attack him. Yeah, it's a 22. Eight. No. No. Yeah, but I'll use uncanny dodge. Yeah. So, half that or all of that? Half that. Okay, so seven. That hits, yeah. All right. I don't remember. It was early 20s. I'm Vax. Oh, you're from California. I have one healing potion left, and I'm going to take it and stick it into this girl's mouth and empty it and maybe drip a little on her neck as well. It's 2d4? Yeah, regular. It's the lowest of the rung. Moderate? I think it's called moderate? So four. Six. And then I want to step in front of her, between her and that one, and then stab the one. So is that the bonus action, or is that the action? Action, okay. By the way, I'm realizing I didn't click my boots, so I did one two three before, and the third one missed, so luckily that worked out, but I'm not clicking those. So I just step between them, and that's all I can do, yeah? No, I mean between her and the closest one to her. I was hoping to stand in front of her, yeah. Like that. Welcome to the party. Forearms go (explosion noises). (laughter) Mr. Anderson. Come on, baby. One more time. Why advantage? I'm just curious. Give it to me, but what's the advantage from? Because they're in flanking. Got it. I'm going to use disengage, and I'm going to hop over Cassandra towards Anders and stab him in the other eye. First attack is 21. Second attack is 17. Okay, ten on the first, ten on the second. So, question? I asked if I could hit the eye. Did I hit the eye? Okay. And I'm squared off right in front of him. Yeah. I am on my feet, but I am swaying back and forth. I'm bleeding out my mouth. Do I get an attack? A reaction attack? No. I don't have that. That hits. I'm down. That's it? And I-- there wasn't even any rolls for that, right? Yeah, and just to understand the whole breakdown, but where do the three rolls come in? Oh, if nobody hits, got it. Got it. Acrobatics. That's good. It was amazing. I'll never forget it. How close are the suits of armor to me? I can't tell. Right next to me? And am I still prone? So how much movement does it take to-- Half my movement. No, I'm going to get up, and I'm going to use disengage. Yeah, and I'm going to skip back into the corner, and at this point I can throw one dagger at that suit of armor, so I'm going to do that. That is 19. I have no voice left. That is an 11. Classic rage, we call it. You're Scanlan Shorthalt. Roll two d8s. (clicks his teeth together) Good to know. I'm just going to walk as far as I can, so 30 feet. Am I within 40 feet? Then I just stand. All right, yeah. I'm going to move around that table and get by Scanlan. Stand right next to him.
