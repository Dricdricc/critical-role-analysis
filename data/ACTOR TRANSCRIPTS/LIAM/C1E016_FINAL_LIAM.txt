Hi, guys. Hi! I am deep in upstate New York on the Canadian border. It's frightening to drive here at night. I can't wait to do it at two in the morning. My mug? Here's mine. I'm on a river. I'm on a river. Unfortunately, Travis has to leave the show. Is there a full table behind this computer? Am I in his chest again? I don't think we should go any more meta than it has to be. That's hot. Hey, DM, days have gone by? No, not a question, but last night while Grog was sleeping-- I can see right up Grog's nose. While Grog was sleeping, I went and got a bit of rope from the ship and used my disguise kit that I have. I sort of frayed a part of the rope and spent about an hour using spirit gum to glue bits of frayed rope to Grog's chin into a small Gilmore-esque goatee. And he didn't seem to wake up, and I'd like to see how that worked out. May I ask, is magical ability inversely proportionate to wisdom? Is everything copacetic between the different tribes? Are they happy? Keyleth, did your mother have to go alone, or does your tribe permit there to be help for you? I'd like to do an insight check before we hustle off. Kima. I rolled an 18. Why does she seem anxious? Does she seem different? Does her demeanor seem different, or does she just seem in a hurry? Yes, please. 13. Oh shit, Tiberius. Sa-REN-rae! (laughter) I'm gonna stay with it but try to blend in with the crowd. Yes. 23 for stealth. I do applaud your honesty, though, sister. I don't think that I was with the group, I think I was back with the crowd-- -- so I see the eagle fly off and I'm just gonna follow after her. Yeah. No. Now that I understand the-- But do I still get shut in my face? So. It's a big solid building, doors are shut, that's it? Yeah. Stop gasping, I don't see shit, Laura. Shit. Hardass. (laughter) That is the baddest one. Vord. Hi. Question, please. We'll clear out your basement, that's not a problem. I'd like to understand how you plan to protect this horn, how you plan to keep it out of the hands of entities who would use it for ill-- Then how-- that's fine. The holiest place on the map. Three-zero? Sorry, my communication earring was a little low there. What was said? You got it. You got it. I'm glad to get out of upstairs, I mutter to my sister, because the decor up there was shit. That is... high. That was a 26. Just traps. That's a 19. Yeah. Hustle, hustle. I'm running ten feet ahead of everybody. I rolled a big old one. (laughter) Bring it. You said dex save? Dex save? 26. Well, rogue with Uncanny Dodge, for a successful save gets zero damage. Tuck and roll. I'm back! When I bite into a York Peppermint Patty-- 29. Everybody stand back. I'm going to click my Boots of Haste-- Yeah, me. I'm going to click my Boots of Haste, I'm going to run, I'm going to do a sort of a running roll, land on the closest circle and wait for half a tick and then roll off of it. Okay. 22. I'm going to use Luck because that blew. And that's a natural 20. SAM AND Okay. (laughter) That is 18. That is 15. That's a 23. I'm like an acrobatic cheetah. 23. I'd like to check if there's any kind of device or anything on this side-- I'm just trying a perception check. 25. Is there a clear shot of it or is there (bang bang bang) going on? Get it, girl. Get it. She rolled a 35, we don't need shit. As they come to the other side, I clutch my broken rib and injuredly hold a hand up and give a half-assed high-five to my sister. (grunts) Yeah, you're welcome. 24. Plus ten from what? Say again? Oh, 34. That is a 16. Did you say Vax, Percy? I'm doing my best seeing from where I can see here. Keyleth is right in front of me? Okay, there's a little bit of distance, so I'm just going to start hucking daggers at them. I'm going to start with dagger of life stealing. That is a 16 to hit. Okay, so that is four, six, is ten of damage. Then the keen dagger follows. That is a 27. That hits for ten damage, and then-- And then the flametongue dagger. You're right, forget it, yeah, forget that last. That's right, two. I don't like this. What was that number, again? That's very... that's sweet. I love it. Ah, that's what I was at after I healed myself with a handful of hit dice after getting crushed into the ceiling. I would like to continue to stealth ahead of the group and also continue checking for traps. Oh, he is? 14. Yeah, 14. I'm moving in. Ditto, kiddo. I'm going to tail my sister, actually. I'm drinking a healing potion right now. What kind of check? 26. Nine.
