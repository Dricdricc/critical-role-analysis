Bauza is funny as fuck. With Bauza at the table, any celebrity could show up. He can impersonate anybody. Anybody. Oh, there's some stuff in the store! Okay, go to Geek and Sundry's dot com, whatever the store is! We should probably re-announce the art book that we're making. There's an art book that's happening. It's going to hit in the fall, at some point. It's amazing. We've seen it. We've held an approximation of it. It's beautiful. And as long as we're vamping, I've seen some of that comic book, man. It's looking good. It's under the table in my bag. It looks so good. We're behind his meniscus, right? Aren't we in his knee? Oh, real close to the butt, yeah! We're doing something. We're going to fuck around. Brian and I are chatting about it. You'll be naked. I'm going to be bringing in a bag of Bazooka Joe comics, from the gum. I'm sure there are Critters in Space-X. Boy, let me tell you what I had for lunch today. I will jaeger Pike, Grog, and Vex. It will be fine. "Titties. Let's do it." I did a very good job with merchandise. If she weren't controlling it, would there still be, even though it's dangerous, some air? I'll be up front. Pike will walk right in front of Grog. Because we don't know what part of this is the titan's butt and earth, but some of it could have been made by cannibal dwarves at some point, I'm going to assume I'm looking for traps and listening for undead cannibal dwarves. That is a 27. Speak Rammstein and enter. It's in the grab bag. It's an option. We're playing Pike. We are. We're the Pike jaegers. You can do the impression, and I will sort through the pages. Pike needs to do it too, right? 13 for the other gnome. How far away is it? I'm going to creep up 20 feet in front of everybody else. Divine Sense, which is specific to undead location, not vague, if there's any within 60 feet. I'll use one. So it's leading up to a plateau? I'm going to scuttle up and look over. 41. This is old news, guys. This is old news. This is what I get to do. Yeah. I turn around to group, and do like a-- And then I go down over, stealthing along the way. I was, as well. The twins were scrabbling at the rock. Wait. Matt, wait. 19. Pike rolled a one. Does Pike's Mace of Disruption always shed bright light for 20 feet? We've been in here under an hour. Probably not much time left, but under an hour, right? Since we arrived? Okay. How high is the ceiling in this tunnel? 12 feet. I will float above everybody, in the space above their heads. We can fudge it. Probably between Percy and Pike, if we can manage it. And I'm going to dagger, dagger, dagger, with sharpshooter on all three, the one right below me next to Keyleth. Okay. The first one is a 20. Okay. Second one is balls. And the third one is... 20. And because assassin and they haven't gone yet-- oh, I have advantage because of assassin, so sneak attack. Also next to Keyleth. Multiple reasons for sneak attack, so that is 11, plus psychic damage is 15. (counting) 36 for the first one. And then the last one does a rinky-dink one. Because off-hand attack doesn't get any-- Yeah, just one. And I'll stay floating. No modifier. That's the modifier. That's calculated from dexterity. Oh, so two. And 20 more for the sharpshooter. What, you're sucked in the ground? No! Yeah. Vax sees that and is not worried. (laughter) Dang, Perce. He vanished? Should've seen the green. So that's why Vax's feathers were prickling the other time. What about between Grog and Scanlan? That way if one of them comes up by either of them, she's there. Punch the mace and light that shit up. Blow hair out of her face. (singing) Fucking die. About 20 feet. Can I move ten feet closer to Scanlan, and do the classic Van Damme movement and stand between stalactites in the ceiling and hide with my bonus action. Yeah, and hide in the ceiling. Nah, I'm just using my feet for that. No, my hands are occupied. With my feet, yeah. Stealth check. Yeah, baby. Ten. Do I still have sneaky sneak from you? That's fine. Pike, get out of the way! 27. And I'll hold my attack action. Oh, yeah. That's right. Right. He's dead! Right before the end of the story! Sorry, Perce. They come out "Where did they go?" That is my daughter's miniature. Oh. Shit. Light them up! 50 feet. We have a nice DM. That's in range for me? 24. Am I effectively sneak attacking the fool? No. All right. Cool. Sharpshooter for both. 28 and 26 for me. 38 combined, for my two. My paladin attacks. That's a pretty fucking killer twin moment, right there. You're at your most dashing when you use your sword. Okay, you do it. It is a big seven. It means he gave it rum tongue. Is it like reaching into a sack for you, even though it's the earth? What's this thing on the ground? Can you throw her? And it would be an action to chuck her, though, right? I mean, we could drop her where the thing disappeared. It's still a crapshoot, but it's better than nothing. "Drop me on the ground, Keyleth!" Okay, she is going to still just hold her turn-- She could do it on herself, just in case. Yeah, cast Resistance on herself in case-- Instead, she's going to look at the ground and go, "Monstah!" And hold her mace. There is weird energy at this table! No! No! (laughs) Didgeridoos? TRAVIS and Sam, when everyone leaves, all their stress will enter you and I. I'm going to fly over and land on Keyleth's shoulder and hold my attack for as soon as the fucknut appears. Perch. Dagon. And she'll use divine whatsit. Divine Strike. Once a round. Plus 2d8. Do it again. Yeah, and if it's still standing, dagger, dagger, dagger. She does an underswing right up between its legs and hits it in the goolies. She gives it three or four more hits on the ground out of frustration. Yep. I place my hand on Scanlan's shoulder and say I'm sorry. I know this is hard for you. The bear lives. I'm flying! There's a lot of rules in this game. Staying on theme for the night. Sure, sure. And I pat your big stony face and give it a kiss and fly down the hall. At the bottom in the middle? I'm going to do Divine Sense again. For undead. Specifically a location. These are dead dwarves. Pike starts whispering, "I can technically destroy dead things, so, if we sneak me up to the "outside of the wall--" How big is it, too? DM, question. Because I can't remember for sure, didn't, in our story somewhere, we come up with a solution for Pike's noisiness? Something that quieted her down? Regular roll. She casts Guidance on herself to help with that roll. I have another DM question. For paladins, "Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within "60 feet," so that implies number. If I know the location of any, so how many am I sensing? One. Okay. Center. Also, I mean, if Pike can get up and get a peek in, she could take a first shot at turning it. Turnt. Stay turnt. I wonder if getting Pike on the broom or the rug could improve her chances of sneaking up to the door as well, and get a peek in, and try to turn whatever's inside? Okay. Unlimited. No. Okay, so she can do that. She's got a couple of other things she can do with this ability. She's 18th level. It's worth a shot, because we could one-shot a thing, possibly. Possible one shot. You guys go, everybody hang back. Yeah, do I spot anything? Here comes the roll. Checking for traps, investigation right? 20. However, there's still an undead thing inside. But I don't find any traps? (sighs) Can we see, well, can Pike, "Can I see into the hovel?" Oh, it's closed? Vax's wings go (poof). The last king. "When I'm turning undead, if they're like little piddly guys, they blow up, but if he's a "king he might not blow up." "So he might get scared of me, or nothing, I don't know?" "Well, time is of the essence, he could have something useful. It seems like a coin flip." "That's tempting," Liam said. Yeah, of course. Yeah, all right, so-- Pickle, are you ready to go? "Yeah!" Okay, shhh. I'm going to try and open it as silent as possible. Strength check? Good grief. 16. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Enough to see in? "Grog--" Pike goes like this (yells) as soon as the door opens. I mean, as soon as Pike sees him flex, she's got her hands-- Vax catches Pike's shoulder. Hold on, let me look. I'm checking the boxes for traps. And the door. Plus seven. 19 for the investigation. The door and boxes. Okay. Here we go. Thieves' tool, yeah. That's fine. Yeah! 30. (shutting noise) Just go down the line. Yeah. (laughs) That's a 29. With Luck. Okay, here we go. That's fine. That's a 27. I did one, two, let's jump to five. No. Are you here? Did you whisper it to me? They don't relock when I go? My sister's hounding me at the door, so I'm going to go back and twiddle my finger inside the empty boxes. Yeah, but I can reopen them. They don't relock, do they? But retrap, I mean? So I'll go do this inside. I go to box five. Oh, that's great. Yeah, that works. That was investigation and it's 26? That is a 33? Yeah. Two more. 18. I'm leaning back. Good. 20. Let's do one more. 19. Yeah, I'm going to hold my breath and-- wait, wait, wait. Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I take up Whisper and I go (unlocking) (wind blowing) and throw it at the wall. Yep. I walk over to it (finger swirling sound). Oh, I did that to the top! I open it up (finger swirling sound). Yes! It does it again?! It didn't expend?! I would've thought there'd be a little container-- With what?! Are there a bunch of gnomes down there?! I'm just going to take it, a 14, that's not good enough. I'm fine, I'm fine, I cough. I feel alive-- of what? Of the room? You never know. They could've died trying. And then walked away undead. Ask your rogue, dude. Do you mind if I give a second opinion? You know, what could it hurt? Oh, not that good though. No, lower than what you rolled. It's okay, you're good now. Natural 20. Pick it. Pike is, though. She's been doing this for five minutes. Total of 37. I'm a level 18 rogue! But you're inside. 25. Could you say that Vax saw the look of panic in Pike's eyes and Blessed her in a split second? Too bad I didn't recognize the last one. It's open. Pickle, come on. She grabs her holy symbol and flips it the bird and Turns Undead. Wisdom saving throw DC, oh shit, so many pieces of paper. 18. One round? I'm going to fill up with three daggers and dump Divine Smite into the first. 32, 19, 32. Okay, first and third hit. Sneak attack on the first because assassin, and I'm going to dump Smite into it. Three plus eight. Let me get the dice first. (counting) 41. And the Smite is 3d8 because it's undead. I said 41, right? 41, 45, 46, 52, doubled is 104. Plus the psychic damage. 109. For the first attack. Bad experience with coffins. 22 for my investigation. Oh no, you can fly over. You might be feeling some issues right now if it were cursed. I could Detect Good and Evil. Fred. Freddie. I wasn't going to say I could do anything. I think that's a shitty idea right now. Natural 20. Far-ish? Further than my visual range. Okay, we've got company up ahead. So, yeah. Stealth. 30. Man, I had to pee so bad, I ran out of the room. How close am I to that? Divine Sense. It's undead. Okay. Or a fiend or a celestial? (daggers whooshing) One two three. Advantage on all three attacks. First attack is 29. Second attack. Second attack is 32. Third attack is 27. Ten, 14, 17, 23, 24, 48 plus psychic damage. 54 for the first attack. We're not in Emon in the market square! We are in hell. Perception check. 31. All right, I'm going to sneak up to it. Flame Tongue is out, what am I looking at? Yeah. Liam knows what this thing is, but Vax does not. Fuck this thing! I'm going to start looking-- what are the trinkets on it? Oh, he could do anything! Was he? Did you say investigation or perception? Investigation, all right, thank you. Some weird energy tonight, guys. 19. I rip off the spyglass and go, oh, that looks nerdy, Percy will like that, and then I yank off the dagger and go, that looks all right, and I stick it in the Blinkback Belt and then-- what was the last thing? It was a key. To the bronze door right, yeah. In the dark by myself. Oh, that is fucking hilarious. The tattered remains of the book? Eh. Eh. I don't. I let it sink back into the water. A one eyed, one horned, swimming, purple, people-- Come on up, please, we should keep moving. Oh, Freddie. Get excited. I found a spyglass covered in diarrhea. Would you like it? You know what? 82 people tweeted me that Pike speaks Dwarvish. So thanks guys, thanks. It's a match-three game, right? You might have seen a corpse in the water, floating. To perceive a dead body in the water. Let's have a look. Oh, terrible. 18. Yes, Greg? Vax is backing the fuck up. We're all going to die. Looking for traps, dead guys, from the door. Oh, somebody rolled this place. 18 investigation check for traps and dead guys. So if dudes came in here and put stuff in sacks, there wouldn't be scrapes. Mini Jenga. Well, there's something under that. Do you want to? I don't think it's a small child down here. What do you want to do, Sis? I don't have much of that left. Yeah, my last one, I'll use it. My last one. Detect undead, Divine Sense. How far away is it? Yay, maps! Look at all the gold! Look at this great tile work! I love Dwarven Forge! We are taking that bird. That's our Percival. 15. Oh! Two! (impact) Kind of a gooch-smashing day, so she's going to walk right up to him and slam it right into his junk, yeah? That is what she's going to do. Well, if she wants to use one of three channel divinities for today. She's hitting him in the gooch. 23 to hit. All right. Plus the what's it called? Divine Strike, so three plus four is seven, plus the 2d8. That ain't a d8. That's 13. 21. To the gooch. Yes! That's right. Fiend or undead take extra 2d6 radiant damage. Whatever I just told you. And now I'm going to roll for that extra-- That was the Mace of Disruption. Plus Divine Strike. Once on each turn, add 2d8 of weapon damage to your damage total. (gun cocking) Gooch shot. She needs to jump up to hit it. What's at 18? We're not sure. 17 or 18. Real life is hazy. Double gooch shot! Keep looking at mine. Same thing. 23. (counting) 12 and then the radiant damage. 2d6. So we're at 12 plus five plus-- no, once per turn. 17. No, she's going to face him down. It's a half hour ago, at this point. You can say no. You go blind. (whispering) Grog, I'm so glad we're together at last. Finally, an enemy that can kill Grog. No, it wouldn't. Double the dice. So next I'm up? Right. I'm going to move past Pike, past the troll, and hold my action should anything come from that room. If I see a creature running at any of us, I'm going to throw. Yeah. (dagger noises) Okay. I'm going before them in the order. Does that mean I get advantage, due to assassin? Cool,. 25 for the first. Okay. Second is a 25. Third is a 15. Oh, okay. Cool. Right, so what did I say for the first two? Okay, cool. But no sneak attack at all, so here they come. First one is 11, plus psychic damage is 17 for the first, and the second one is 15 for the second. 17 and 15. No. That does hit. I'll use Uncanny Dodge on it. That hits. Balls. Okay. (singing) Don't fail me, Raven Queen, like you've done so many times before. (speaking) That is a 17. What do you mean? I'll roll it again, if you want. I don't care. I'm rolling it again! That's way worse nine. You've just peaked, Sam. Let me take my antlers off. Yes. Okay. That hits, yeah. That's fucked up, Matt. Yeah. We're just going to slog. Slog it out, man, slog it out. (laughter) Yes, please. Well, it could be their version of Death Ward. Fire does work on trolls, yes. It's on foam, but it's good. Love you. Oh jeez. Okay. So I think-- She could turn undead, but how far are they? They're probably too far apart. Well, no, she could stand between them and do it. 30 feet. So she stands between. She's going to climb up on-- no, I'm not going to say that. She's going to take a step diagonally down this way and then turnt undead. Wisdom saving throw. Spell save is 18. If they're challenge rating four or lower, they're blowed up. Yeah, wisdom save, and that just means they're scared. Move as far away as you can from the person. Also cannot take reactions. For its action, it can use only the dash action. All they can do is run. So he didn't strike the troll at all? What I'm going to do is turn to Trinket really quick and say, guard this dead thing, and then I'm going to use my movement and dash action, if necessary, to sprint around and flank that troll between me and Grog. Flanking with Keyleth? Okay. If Keyleth is on the other side-- as long as I'm flanking, either way. No, I'm fine. I'm flanking with Keyleth right now? To the butt. That's fine. 28 on the first. And ooh, 30-something on the second. Okay, so first one is (counting) 11 plus psychic is 12, plus those guys. (counting) 28 for that one. Sorry. That was the first one. The second one I'm going to shove it down into its eye socket and just grind it around for the second attack, even though it's down. That's it. Done. Nope. I did a constitution save 20 minutes ago. Was it dead or was it undead? I'm just being stupid; go for it. I'll be fine. Yeah, dude. I already rolled terribly for Pike. Pike got a five. Vax got a 20. Lovely. But it's not a one-shot; it's got several charges, right? She's a fucking Jedi! I can imagine it in the abstract universe, though. I sure can, Laura Bailey! I sure can! You could dash. Broom dash. Pike saw Keyleth go running down that way, so she is going to run after her. (counting) She can't see the troll from there, right? She can see the troll? Oh my god, I think it's time for a Guiding Bolt! Range 120 feet. A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage and the next attack roll-- okay. Yeah, make a spell ranged attack plus ten, because it's Pike. Yeah, you've got to attack. Yo, here's the white die you gave me. 13 plus ten is 23. Specifically toward the taint, Matt. Pike's on a tear today. The Guiding Bolt streaks through the air, loops down to the ground, up through the butt, up out the head, and out the mouth. Everyone vaguely hears, "That's my Pike." And its head explodes. That happened in six seconds. It was like, (explosions). Okay, realizing that the druid and the goliath are going to have to figure that out, Vax walks to the middle there and starts to take a wee in the corner. It's been a long time. Yeah, let her do her thing. I think we can afford a few minutes. Then Grog could finish attuning-- oh, you did. That "stop hitting yourself" hammer was attuned. You are going to crit on Vecna and K.O. yourself. Greater Restoration? I'm looking. She'll grab him by the cheeks and squish the cheeks and say, "Grog, don't go touching things "you don't know what they are!" Cast Greater Restoration. She gives you the mom look and says, "Don't touch it, okay?" Guys, have so much fucking fun on the playa. Recharge, reset, energize, go nuts. Miss you. No! They need to recharge! Give them some space, let them recharge! I'll be topless on Sam's one-shot. You can look at me instead. Push-ups for seven days; here we go!
