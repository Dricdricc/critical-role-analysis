(sighs) That's what you rolled the last time. I'd like to wind my way up there, as well. Yeah. I'm still curious. I want to go have a look as well. 16. I jog on down. Yeah. That's a 23. Okay. You want to open that, big guy? I hear him say "Um," and I jump down, too. With the Flametongue dagger out for light. You might be right. Yeah, let's go have a look. "Hold, please." Perception check the coffin. That's a 20. I really feel like this could be-- I kick it off with the end of my foot. Little bit. Or try to. Roll it up. Put it into my satchel. I'm going to take a dagger out and I want to cut all the way up through that purple velvet. Just see, just in case. I think we need to get out of here. Yeah. Critmas! Crimmas. I did all right. 43. The alcove? I'll see about that. I'm going to check the door. That is ten. 23. All right. 20. I can get in there and see who that is. I can go in, yeah. I thought it was upstairs, or you said right on the other side of the door? This is hard to believe, but this is crazy grandma. You don't recognize us, it's not safe to walk these streets for outsiders, so we were using a little bit of trickery. This is us. We're the same people you were dealing with before. Overnight. They won't. The giants are going to keep smashing them. We stay for an hour. Rest for an hour. I insight-check this woman. 14. I've never fought a zombie giant before. That's what I'm saying. Let's see what we're up against. Let's take a breather and let's go pick one off. They're undead. We take a short rest and then exterminate. It's very mystical. I do. I'm going to sniff it and shake it out. They died. Time to kill some giant undead. They could be-- yes, that could apply, too. 23. I think they cut them down just like Tylieri. I think that this is where they hang them to ripen, and then when they're ready they pluck them off the tree and set them on their way. Keyleth, tell us what you're thinking, because the rest of us are taking this time to go. Who are you? No. Keyleth, we've got to go. I'm also just trying to stay underneath her as best I can. Is she in a skirt? I thought she was covered in leaves. How far away is it? I did. 27 and an 18. Keen Dagger, Flametongue, combined 20 hit points. I grab Keyleth by the arm and I just pull and run. Buckle up!
