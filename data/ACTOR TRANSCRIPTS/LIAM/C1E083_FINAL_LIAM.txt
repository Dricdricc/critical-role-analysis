You're dating us. Can you buy it? Oh, I got a quick one. Taliesin and I were playing Ubisoft's game For Honor this morning for Nerdist and Geek and Sundry. It was fun. There'll be more of it tomorrow. We got a couple of warriors in there. I'm playing the knight. The chivalrous knight in that game. You got a major renfaire boner playing that game today. Yeah, ages ago. I just don't know how long it lasts. Flying up on the broom, all that. Just roll another 20. Never mind. 30. Yeah, I thought you did. What the fuck was that? Can I look at the ceiling, every other part of this room except for where she is, to see if she's also somewhere else? 22. I would like to move across from my sister and move forward up to-- I can't tell from the overview, but a little bit of rock's right there? And stay hidden. Yeah. (posh voice) Hello. (all laugh) I've got a mastiff. I'll donate it. Same. Hunter's Mark. No, the paladin checked for undead. 25. And we see nothing. And two eggs. All right, I'm going to cross back across, north, to the-- I mean, I click on the Boots of Haste. I'm going to move straight towards you, Matt, across the hall so I'm by the corner there. No, not that far. No, closer to me. Right there. And I'm going to throw at the eggs. And it's... I'm going first, so with Assassinate, I get advantage on all these because I'm the first to go in combat? Yes? Yep. Starting at third level, you are deadly, so you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. That's great. And I'm going to use sharpshooter, so I get a negative five on these. Yeah! 21 for the first. Okay. (laughing) The second one is 18. Okay. And that is-- oh, that's not that good. Is 14. Do they all three hit, or just the first two? First two. Okay. So the first one gets sneak attack damage. That's right. What, you want them to take less damage? Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. 32 for that one. And what the heck, I'm going to poison that egg, so that is (laughing) Seven. That egg has to make a DC 15 success against poison. (all laugh) So, does it get half? Or... half, right? Or none? I don't know. I've never killed an egg before. Not poisoned. So give it another seven hit points of damage from the dagger itself. Seven for that second attack. The earlier one was 32. Isn't Dungeons and Dragons fun? Yeah, I'll stick with it. I don't know if it makes a difference, I called Sharpshooter on my shots before but forgot to add the additional ten per attack. Okay. (nerdy voice) Raishan! (all laugh) It's kind of always doing that a little bit, though. Can't you put that drug pipe down for like five seconds? J-E-L-L-O. I don't know if we're going to kill Raishan, but we smoked those eggs. That hall looks dangerous right where he is. There's two magical columns right there. It's not a natural one, though. The room was empty. Play-date! But he's only seventh-level! Divern Smert! Oh, good roll. The way that cloak goes is they're at disadvantage if they hit you once, then it goes away until the start of your next round. It keeps resetting. Maybe. Oh, we got three paladins. (laughs) Silver lining, silver lining. Did they come out of the cages? I think they're like gauntlet generators and they're just like-- Savage. (Pike voice) I'm going to-- (Pike voice) In the shape of a-- Can she move? Druid's going country. Uh... shite. Are there still dead things with Groggy? I'm going to attack them. I'm going to throw, but I'm going to go one dagger at the one above him. Yeah. On this side. Okay. They were both roughed up real bad. So the one that's fucked up I will attack. So I'll throw one at that. That is good. That is a 31. Yep. And I'll throw-- yeah, I'll throw another one at that one. Yeah. That is 18. Can I wait and see how much damage I do? Oh, then yeah, then I'll just attack one at a time, I'll save that roll, though, for the next. So that is two plus eight is ten. Plus... Oh, Grog is, so it's flanked! So it's Sneak Attack. Thanks, buddy. You're also my buddy. 16. I mean, it's got to be gone. Okay, then the next two-- The first one gets 18. And then the second one is a 17. Okay, so there it goes. I'm going to roll this one. That's three plus eight is 11 plus the psychic damage has gone missing-- Where is everything, where's my dice? 18 for the first. Eight for the second. Without the attack? Oh, sorry, so, well if I rolled a two, okay. So then just two. So 18 plus two, 20. Okay. And I see that Grog is in pretty good hands with Kerrek, so I'm going to use my movement, which is hasted, to slide around this way and crouch ten feet in front of Keyleth. There. Ahead of Keyleth. Between Raishan and her. Yeah. Smell that dragon. LIAM and So sorry, since I'm new with Hunter's Mark, later I can take my floating Hunter's Mark and bring it over to Raishan? Sweet. That's good. 32. That's okay. You will be a golden god if this works. Higher than her hit points, yeah. Well, that's-- Yeah. No way. You might what? So you don't need the grit. Necro. Final Fantasy. Natural 20! There is no negative, he's just down. You have to surpass your total-- Natural 20. Hip hop hippity hop. Yep. A skillion hit points. Yeah, Perce! De Rolo just went full peacock. He suddenly has a giant cowboy hat on. Am I good with my Hunter's Mark? Our relationship is very complicated. We need a scene with the dog and Trinket commiserating over a bowl of-- Constantly getting blasted up. It's everything he deserves. Disintegrate toward Pike. Pass it. Fuck. I'll roll it, one of us has to roll it. Here's what it is, this is what it is. It's a 14. Yeah. She gets like one hit point, I think. She's up, she's up. She's not dead. Okay, she's not dust. 16. It's a constitution saving throw. Straight roll. Seven. Do you want to do it? I'll do it. Go for it. New campaign next week. (all laugh) Now, with the boots of haste, one of the extra actions has to be for an attack, right? I couldn't do-- Yeah, it says the extra action can be used to attack, dash, disengage, or hide. Shite. So I'm going to... balls. I'm going to go to the gnome on the ground and I'm going to cast Lay on Hands-- Pike is up, isn't she? Conscious is what I mean. To Scanlan. And one hit point, just to get you up. I'm going to use a little more movement to move to the same spot that Bigby's was before it was gone. Maybe into the-- the cloud's gone, right? Maybe I'll even go ten more feet forward-- Vow of Enmity. As a bonus action. And I will use the extra action to disengage and get the fuck out. I'm going to go that way. Back towards Scanlan. I should have 60 feet of movement hasted. Disengage. I will actually go along the wall. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you would've seen me go-- Get it nerd, get it. The dragon doesn't blow up? This could be the difference between-- Because one or two death saves, three death saves. This is down to the wire, dude. That was the bite, wasn't it? Yeah, can I do an attack of opportunity as it flies by? All right. Can we all see the hammer fly through the air? Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, so sorry. 27. Zero. Is it close, ah. Oh, okay. I'm going to use one Luck. What does that mean, if I use luck? Disadvantage, and then I rolled a six and-- Say again? That's right, it does. So that cancels out. So the first one-- but I'm still using Luck, so the first one was a six, the second one was a 31. Nine plus psychic damage... ten. 25. She's looking pretty rough. Look out, Perce. Put a counterweight. Plus her wisdom, whatever you roll plus the wisdom. Marisha, what a beautiful moment! Get it, get it! Poetic justice, motherfucker! That's right, Matt! That's right. Wow. Wow. I'm just going to unload on her. I'm unloading, dagger-dagger-dagger. At advantage on all of it. And can I do-- I've got two spells left, so can I do Smite and Smite? Because it just says on melee attacks, it doesn't say how many a round or anything. I don't know, I've never tried to do it. All right, so. First attack is-- hits, it's 32. Second attack-- Oh, okay. Well, let's just say I Whisper onto her neck. So that's the first attack, and I get Smite. Second attack is a 27. I'm just going to do dagger-dagger, actually. And the first attack-- That's all right. I didn't ask for that. So that's one plus eight is nine, plus the psychic damage makes it 12, plus Smite is... 22, plus sneakies. Yes, yes, yes. (counting) 53 is the first attack. Second attack is also getting, okay, so one, just one, okay. Plus five and... eight. All right. And I'm going to use my bonus action to disengage and just leap away from her and just tumble-crash to the ground. Okay. 25. And I have 60 of movement, so leaping off and rolling, does that use it all up, or can I move against the wall? Just keep going after I disengage from her? Thanks. Tuck and roll. I already get advantage. I got the paladin eyes on her. That is the most perfect, poetic moment. Could not have been better. In character, in character. No, no, no. In this state, she's just going to mount you. Not like this. Not like this. Just put your head down on the desk, student. Heads up, seven up. I mean, an eight-foot drop on your head is pretty bad. Stand up. Pacman through it? Yes! Level seven! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I start stumbling over towards Scanlan. I pick him up. I start walking towards Grog with him. On Percy? I'll do it. I don't want you to have-- I don't want you to-- get out of your head, I'll do it, I'll do it. I'll do it. It's just dice. It's the universe. That's low. Plus six. The big one. Yeah, it's a shield. Grog! I've got him in my arms. I just start to rock him like a child. You know, you're very funny, but this is not very funny. Grog. Take him, take him. All right. I head over to where Keyleth is and start looking for traps. I'm going to use my last Luck of the day. I just used my last Luck of the day and I got two ones. Give him back, give him back. But it's not trapped, I checked it. Eh, that's D&D, man. I walk over, I'm going to try-- I kneel down and try Lay on Hands on him, because it can cure multiple diseases and cure poisons with a single use. Sure, five. Is he cursed? We can ferry back and forth on the carpet. Yes. Destroy Undead. Let's find a tree. Do we see any trees? Everything was dead the closer we got to the central-- I mean, the amount of talking we're doing, it's already closed at this point. Yes. We just start walking. Grog and I start walking. Drowning. Gilmore, yes. That's right. That's right. Yeah. One thing at a time. Vax is also listening to that, sometimes you cannot get them back, while holding Scanlan. To the temple of the Raven Queen. I'm already 50 feet towards the temple. No. Can we get the other gate stone and find Shaun. We have both of them, we have them? Yeah, doesn't your sister have the other one? Yes, find the other gate stone and find Shaun. It's a little more complicated. Kymal. All this time, I have laid Scanlan down in the center of the temple, and with a wet rag I have cleaned his face and combed his hair out and laid Mythcarver out next to him. While I'm cleaning, I start talking as well. You know, if it is his time, then I can accept that it is his time. But he just did an awful lot for you. That dragon was tampering with your ways, and without him we would have not gotten as far as we have. He has done a lot for you, and this isn't even bargaining anymore. I am yours. I'm not bargaining. But this little man has more heart in his chest than any man I've met. And if there is anyone who deserves a second chance... I don't know, I don't know. Your will be done. I wasn't expecting-- that wasn't part of the ritual. High rolls. He's going to be so pissed. Sorry! All night long, man, all night long. Push the narrative all night long like Lionel Ritchie, come on. If we wait, he's going to write us off. Also, Feeblemind? Natural 20 on scanning the ocean? Pretty amazing.
