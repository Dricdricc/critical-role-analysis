It's so beautiful. Oh hi, Sam, have you seen our art book? I can't open it now. We're not going to show the audience the insides! Oh my god! One page? I don't know. We'd have to have clearance or something, isn't that how it works? Okay, okay. I guess, I guess. Shit, man. Let's do this Percy page, this bomb-ass double Percy spread. Ooh! (yelling) Look at this gorgeousness! Sorry, Rachel. Yeah, go to the shop. There's lots of shit. They just ran a picture of Squirtle. We're coming up on another issue pretty soon. Hole in the studio floor. She went down it. What about Spider Ham? We're bears. Do we have a Batman belt with honey stashed on it? We have to find it and eat it? Yeah. Those fucking assholes. Hey, my name is Cookie. I am a bear. This is my brother, Waffle. Well, man, we heard this town's got the good shit. I mean, he's a total asshole, but he's really good at his work. We probably want to get closer in before we start using the, you know. Peddy, don't hurt him. Of course I am. A hacker bear! Let me tell you, we've hit all the biggest places. We've hit Vasselheim. We have hit Stilben, okay. We've been to the Briarwoods' home turf, and we got all their fucking honey. We're going to get this honey because this fucking guy is going to hack the system. Where's our ride at? What are we taking this time? You take the bamboo and you stir it around in the honey. You have them together. It's like celery and peanut butter. Don't knock it. All right. Our newfound friend, Trinket. What can you tell us about this town? Where the honey is? What are we working with, here, buddy? We need some kind of distraction. We're going to dress as people. That's the plan. That's right, here's what we're going to do, okay? Cookie and Waffle, we're going to fuck shit up, all right? We're going to get in the garbage, we're going to start fucking with people's shit. I might even scare a little kid. When that happens, you're in. You grab as many fucking hats as you can, and you skedaddle back. We meet up together and then we choose which hats we're going to wear, and which makes us look most human, or elf, or halfling in your case. Oh, shit. Sorry. Okay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to scare a bunch of little children. I want you to start tearing down the festive decorations that you see. Hack the decorations the fuck off the walls and make a lot of noise, Waffle. You got a suggestion, Trinket? You said there's a couple of soldiers, guards? Are there any kids in sight? Between me and them? Or are the kids open season, you know what I'm saying? They might think we're ghosts. Yeah. They'll try to turn us and it won't work. While I get covered up, I'm going to start running towards the kids and yell as loud as I can like this (intimidating scream). I'm going to take a shit and then I'm going to slap it at the grownups' heads that are with the kids. (screams) I start flinging shit at them! Criminal is for flinging shit? This is the smartest idea that any bear has ever had. It's a two! We're out! Right. As we're running, I yell Hack the system! Are you going to poke him in the gooch? Do we take it away from bear when we put it into criminal? Two. That's the best one! Oh my god, what are my options? Holy shit, I'll take leathery tan. Oh my god! Holy fuckballs, I am a happy bear. Woohoo! That is so confusing. Jeez, you're that guy in a western. Somebody get an organ grinder, stat! (sings) I have another brilliant idea. We ripped down these banners. My brother hacked the system. They're really big. I can tear this shit with my claw and make each of us a cloak to go with our hats. Then we'll look even more human. Three years in bear college, my friend! Three. Here's your cloak. Red cloak. Red cloak. We're going to be the black cloaks. Keep it moving! Bidet! MATT and You're in a Johnny Cab! Everybody act casual. Same. I smell gold. Nope. We're in trouble there. What the fuck is this shit? Holy shit, we eat the gnome and then we get the honey. She's covered in honey! (groaning) It's good! I like you, city bear. I like you. We could do big things together. I smell honey, Waffle, I smell it! That's about a hogshead worth. Little gassy, you think? Wait a minute. You got a whole hatful of honey. Can I have a little honey? I'm going take a little bite of this honey. (swallows) I've had honey with jalapeno in it, a little bit of hot pepper. Texture. Does that put me back towards bear, though? I had some honey; don't we get towards bear if we have honey? All right. I was liking that guy, but I don't know. We don't need any martyrs in this group. What's the range on the Vex necklace? You got a bead on it? We're going to stick to the alleyways, we're going to make our way there quietly. All right? Little guy? Vegas. Take point! 15 HB. Just get ahead of us, look around the corner, see if anybody's coming. If there's anybody there-- You're two feet tall; don't kill them immediately, just give us a signal! It's a good thing you're a good at pulling thorns out of our paws, I'm telling you, Vegas. Get up there, earn your fucking keep. Bee-Team, come on! Does it say de Rolo on it? So it's big enough for Vegas, but not for a bunch of bears. Yeah, smart. We don't have the city bear back yet, right? What's up, big guy? Well, I don't like to burn. Uh-huh. What, are you saying there's a correlation? That's a joke for 83 people. I give that joke five bear claws out of five. Very nice! Hey, friend. Let me ask you something. Are you one of those cow-cows or one of those people-passing-themselves-off-as-cows? Just to avoid confusion. Beefcake! I don't think we have a problem here. There's not a lot of overlap you guys like grass, you guys like ribbons. Fuck 'em up, Peddy! I'm going to grab Las Vegas by the scruff of the neck off the Radio Flyer and I'm going to try to chuck him on top of Cow. You're the driver; steer that shit! She's a fucking cow. Do you think she's going to go to the city council and report a bunch of bears? We need to keep on the task at hand get the honey and get out. We got it. Trinket, I'm going to make a proposal to you. Yeah? It doesn't make any sense. I'm doing business, all right? Sit tight. It doesn't seem that important in the grand scheme of things. Keep your mind on honey, all right, Peddy? Las Vegas. You're the best at what you do, bud, but hold on. The big bears are talking business. You seem like a hard motherfucker to me. Once we get the honey, I get the sense that you've got ties to these people. What say you run free with us? We could hit Vasselheim. We could get all the fucking honey of every temple in that city. The good stuff, after this. I like this guy, Waffle. I'm all right. I'm feeling pretty in control, so let those in need scoop the honey first. You know how you can tell a panda bear is a vegan? It never fucking stops telling you about it. No, Vegas, we do Bee-90X. He talks a lot of sense. Come on. We've got to keep our eyes on the prize. We've got to get to this inn. You got a scent on it, Waffle? Snake? Snake! I failed big time. I rolled a six. Goddamn tree. Farted the whole way there. Smokescreen. Done. Out. Honey got. Does that save all of us, or just him? So it goes... Last time you did this, you got stoned for three days on the outskirts of Kraghammer. I had to talk you out of that tree. Took me three fucking days! Do you have yourself in control? Moderation. Moderation. I'm going to run out and help him. I'm going to jump the other kid. I failed hard. Son of a bitch! Do I have a kid on my back, by the way? I trip one of them as they run. Run, you stubborn prick, you! (manic laughter) Kid, how would you like to be an official bear bandit? (bear sounds) This kid. I like this kid. No, you had your fun for the day, all right? I remember this one time in Las Vegas... All right. You got the smell of honey in your nose, and we're going to the Sunkist Inn. We know the head of security is up a side stairway. What the fuck do we do with that? How close are we to this tavern? Waffle, what does your nose tell you? Is it like three glens or five? Two glens over? Okay. Well, let's get close. I want your nose and my nose. I have a pretty good nose. The best noses. You'd be surprised! We get outside that tavern and try to figure out where in that building that honey is, it's probably in the tavern, probably in the basement of the tavern, probably in the back in the larder-- but let's check it out. Come on. Some bad breaking news. This just in Laura and Travis actually tripped and fell into a giant vat of Tim Tams in Australia and were smothered to death. There was no coffee nearby. Our miniature Superman capes. This could be yours, Trinket, forever and ever and always. Hold up. I take a whiz on the wheels to silence them. I do it! Yeah. How's it sound now? The people do that here. Is there a picture of the sun on the sign? This is it. Peddy. Peddy, I love you, but this is not your natural environment, even. You're not even a bear that's from these parts. You're the strongest bear in the group. We love you. We need you. But come on, let's take it one bear paw at a time, all right? Listen, when we need you to crush somebody's skulls, who are we going to ask? This guy? No. You! Only you. We don't insult your integrity. What are we, animals? All right, cool your jets, Johnny Cash. Let's case this joint, okay? Waffle! Where's the honey smell coming from in this place? The last five years of video games have prepared me for this moment. Point of order. Excuse me, BM. BM? Bear master, bee master. Take your pick. Can you please paint a picture of the outside of this building for us humble bears? Where we did our expert plan. Yeah, okay. What about a side entrance to the security guard? I didn't smell that. I wasn't there. All right. All right. This is good. You're telling me that the honey is not right through the main doors of the tavern. They've probably got some dipshit upstairs guarding it, around the back. That's good. This works in our favor. We can see the stairway up to security guards? I've got an idea brewing. Let's get a closer look. Fail! BRIAN and Who the fuck is that? May be too good to be true. We go in there-- people, right? They're tricky. They've got brains and stuff. Their intelligence is at least eight or higher. If we just go in there, it could fucking blow up in our faces. Maybe that's what we do; maybe we have no other option. Here's what I'm thinking-- That's going to blow up the honey, though. You can't eat burned honey like that. It's not your fault you're vegan. You have very little experience with honey. Yes, the honey will burn. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it. I'm just saying it's real stupid, okay? What's above the door? There are giant doors on the ground floor, right? There's no stairs up or nothing? No, I don't. I want to understand what I'm looking at. Is it brick, stone? The building is more than one floor? Is it possible for a honey badger to climb up the side of this building? This is what I'm thinking, and we could rush in there; it wouldn't be the first time we've done that, Waffle. But here's what I'm thinking one of us gets up higher than the door and waits, and you, Trinket, you speak people pretty good. You could fool people into thinking you're a human. So we send somebody above the door, you knock on it, draw them out, invite them into a conversation, and when they start talking, bam! Honey badger on their fucking head! You're practically dead! 27? Don't eat the honey. Rub it into your flesh. Hey, buddy. Have some honey. You've earned it. I need him to find his mojo again. Let him have some honey. We're going to be swimming in honey any minute now. This is a Foster badger. (laughter) Liam! Liam, what are you doing up there? Great. The plan is, you've got to teabag a guy when he comes out the door, so stop peeking in the windows now that you're done and get ready, all right? We're going to let the thespian here do his thing, then back off. I swear to god-- Everybody shut the fuck up, okay? Hey, meerkat? Zip it. Look, Trinket's going to knock. Tell us what he does when Trinket knocks. Dollars, dollars, dollars! How's your criminal looking? Not too high, Brian. Not too high. Las Vegas! God, his ear's going to come off. Come on, Waffle. What's to stop the kid from squealing that we done just thrown out the door? Did you? Drag his ass in here, Peddy. Where does my nose tell me where to go? Get up there. He was a bush baby. That's what's on these papers here? Let the bear work. Let him do his thing. You've got this, Waffle. Barrels? Did you say barrels? Some people see zeros and ones, but all I see is honeybees and salmon. (laughter) Waffle's going to fight Sugarcone! You all right, brother bear? Peddy, teabag that motherfucker. I boot him out the window. Come on, don't fuck me. One. Yeah. Another dose of high art from Critical Role. Full-on Red Dead Redemption. His twisted pretzel body goes two miles, floating five feet above the ground. If one of us bears made a history check, would we know who the fuck this guy is? I'm going to roll a d6, and I'll tell you. Plan D comes first. Peddy, you don't make friends with salad. No offense. Trinket, this is your home turf. I will follow your lead-- He's a vegetarian. All he eats is bamboo. No one's going to respect that in the bear community. I'm picturing a furry Great American Hero. My criminal mastermind brain tells me that this is your turf, Trink. I want to follow your lead. I see recognition in your eyes. You don't like this guy. What do we do? Come on, Bear Eleven. In the pantry? Hold on, I've got this. I'm going to pick this chain's lock. Welcome to Criminal Roll! Cookie is picking the fuck out of the lock, right now! Diddly-diddly-do! That is a fail. Marisha, what does the flashback do? If I tell a flashback, it fixes that? And then roll again? All right. Thin as a blade of grass. Put them on your face, Peddy. Peddy, what are you doing? You can now, if you choose to. Nobody move. This is two years after the Chroma Conclave? She lived! (cheers) Yeah, but just pretend like we were. Do you want in? Don't we look needy? Yeah, are you pulling our legs? What is this, a gingerhazing? We already got a hogshead of honey in his hat. Arcane magic dispelled. Hold on. I walk up to it carefully, gingerly, slowly. I piddle on it. Nothing? I piddle on it again. I really thought that would work. Or Vex? You've got to prepare for the worst, my friend. I need you to be ready. If she makes a move, you're sitting on her. She doesn't breathe. She's breathing in black-and-white ass hair. Your ass hair. I need you to be ready. Steveland Cleamer. Steveland Cleamer. Let's bring it home. Are there any Skittles in it? Honestly, I'm only thinking about honey. Madness coming out. An orange in each, except for two in the pink, right? And two in the pink. Two oranges in the pink and one in every other one. Too much crystal honey in Vegas, Liam. (groaning) Liam, you fucking asshole! Two in the pink! (cheering) You mad bastard. Waffle, this is it. This is our father's dream. We have reached easy street. Fuck yeah. Also, while we're moving, I'm going to take a big fucking bite of honey on the move. Fuck this! Come here, you. Everybody run! And I head towards the Bearracudas. Let's fucking do this. Yes. Waffle, hack the system! Are there still Bearracudas? But she just got pulled through the door? I say I hear my father's voice in the morning. And I dive at the remaining Bearracuda and plow them down into the flammable honey on the floor. Yeah. Fail. Like Ed Harris in the Abyss. We've got to take the honey and run. Come on! Hoppity-hop! Come on! Could've been beautiful, kid. Good luck! Show me the honey. You're sure you don't want to come with us? See the world, sample honey? What the fuck does that mean? I wanted to break canon and take Trinket with us across the nation! Goddamn it! Fucked up canon? Tova's alive! Tova's alive! Tova's alive! Single sheet, in very large text.
