I don't know what this-- ♪ Whoo ♪♪ Before we ran into the bigger chamber, Gilmore and Jarret had caught up with us if I remember correctly. I remember that they did. That's what I mean. Spider Percy's my favorite Percy. He's doing this and nothing's happening. If anyone can make it, it's you. Twenty-seven. Evasion keeps me at zero, yeah? But we saw where she was before she went into-- Yeah. Your screen is flipped. - There's a storm cloud. Two 13's. Not the Mama! Three weeks to stew, everybody. I'm gonna take to the air. I'm going to-- do I still feel hasted yet? I'm going to fly past my sister and slap the one Greater healing potion I have into her palm. Oh, Superior, excuse me. And then I'm going to curve around over Keyleth and stab the egg there with the Dragon Slayer blade. - Yes. - That is 29. Twenty-six. I'm gonna take Whisper and take that further. That is 28 to hit. - That's a total of 15. Fifteen. - And I have--if I'm still hasted, I have a lot of movement left, so I'm going to fly and hover about 15 feet above the egg towards you, towards your DM tape on the side there. - Yeah. Fifteen feet in the air. ♪ I have 120 feet of movement total hasted. No, I'm all the way over there. - That's not where I want to be. I want to be-- I'm arguing with her, not you. Cause that's what we do cause we love each other. Okay. Fifteen feet in the air. That's not the egg that I'm talking about though. I'm talking about the egg closer to Matt. There. - This is where I want to go. That's over there? It's the--it's the flip screen is-- I don't want to go there. I want to go across from everybody. It's the flip. I'm gonna kill you all. There, there. The egg that's there. Literally, in game. The boots, right. Oh, wait, she's with him. - Nice. Clerics are-- You know. - You ruined the surprise. I'll pretend like I suffer it myself. - How high is it to these holes in the ceiling from-- Good. And they're all red, they're all red. Shaun breaks in half. Welcome to Hot Pepper Gaming. No movement either, yeah? This is fucking-- (indistinct whispering) I'm still in the same position 15 feet up that I was. "I'm just a little nervous is all." "Maybe." Pike, Pike, it's your turn. Yeah, let's buff everybody. But she can move forward. But she could get closer to--to Vex, right? Yeah. If she gets near Vex, then she can get Grog, Gilmore, Percy. Yeah, yeah. - Closer to Percy. - Keyleth as well? Why not? Gilmore stabs Vax. "Ceiling." "She's in the fucking ceiling, man." "Yeah." I'm sorry Alien. Ceiling! True to form. Oh, he's sticking to it, yeah. Hanging off a wall. First, we'll all mash together. Yeah. - Oh, thank God. - Okay. She gets the meteor. I hope it's good. -It's a one. - In the fire fort. - Yep, yep, yep. - Superior. Plus eight. - Okay, just to clarify, so looking at the minis. The back side's to me, but really, her face is poking out of a hole, right? Front half of her and she's-- and she's at the roof which is 70 feet up, so maybe her head is down, like, five feet out, ten feet out, something like that? Alright, I want to, and I'm--I'm back, right? -After... - I want to fly-- - Go ahead. - So, if I'm 15 feet up and she's, maybe, 65 down, I'm within range for sharpshooter already. So, and-- and last question. When you do-- for duel wielding, action-- bonus action, but you told me once you can reverse that and do bonus action and action. I think. Never mind then. I'm gonna fly straight at her face, and I'm gonna shove the Dragon Slayer sword into her mouth and I want to try to sever her fucking tongue out of her mouth. - Terrible. Whisper, I'm gonna do the same thing with the bonus action. That is 26. Ten plus four, psychic damage 14. I should have like 10 or 15 movement left with 60 for wings, yeah? If I was 15 feet up and she was a little less than 70? So am I at zero? Okay. All done. Don't think that hits actually. So I'll use Uncanny Dodge. 10,000. Shit, it just hits. - Okay, aim it at-- - Eighteen. - Yeah. Yep. Did you forget? Come on, Golden Snitch! Do it! Find one thing and do it well. Watch this, I'm gonna get turned into pulled pork right now. Eleven for Pike. Can you say it in Spanish? That just hits, Uncanny Dodge. The first one is Uncanny and then the rest are-- Not from that-- so that our Hero's Feast does nothing. Is that the total-- Vax is falling. (gasps) Is this a death save? That sucks. I don't-- I don't know. Have I got any automatic fails in a death save? Hitting the ground? - The armor is set to flame resistance. Okay. I'm rolling an advantage. Twelve, succeed. So, we're good, we're good. I feel like in another dimension this didn't go so well. No, no, no! Duvet, Duvall? - Vax wakes up for two seconds, says, "You da man!" and then lies back down. (laughter) Probably not. It was kind of like rainbows. Gilmore's wearing one right now. He's a really good actor. Yes! Well, we'll find out. Thank you. She dead? - Oh, shit. Okay, so half my movement just to get to standing, right? Okay, I'm gonna throw Whisper, Flame tongue. Raishan should be within 60 feet, yeah? - Okay. -Seventeen for the first. - Second is 22. - Ten. - Ten. - And I'm going to use my remaining 15 of movement to go diagonally away from Raishan. Away from-- diagonal. - Yeah. "Um..." - Matt, my wings are toast, right? J'Mon! - Nobody expects the Marquette inquisition. Grog is within range. - Still in the game. - Eighteen. - Eighteen. Thirteen. - No, hey. Thank you. Death save. - I made it. - Take your earrings off, come on. Pike, how close is she to-- - She's gonna run up, kneel down, wait, kiss Vex on the forehead, and say, "Not like this, buddy," and cast Revivify for her last spell. Pike is unconscious? Who's she near? She didn't know she had 'em so we didn't use 'em. She's dead. - So the Sprinter's Boots do nothing, I mean, I don't know. So will she get there? Alright, so Revivify. - It's instantaneous. One action, instantaneous. My gosh. She grabs a dagger out of Vex's belt and cuts off a lock of her hair and presses it into Vex's hand. "It's not time, it's not time for you. No." ♪ Geez, I don't-- Yeah, we're talking about getting people back up. At this point, not healing cause any hit is lethal. So getting someone on their feet. Who's on the ground by Grog? No, I know I am, but who else is that? Is someone up besides me? Go. Well, I gotta go, I've got one success. Yeah. Attack of opportunity, J'Mon. I'm two failures. - I can heal people if I get up. Get out, get out. Are we out of combat now? I stumble over to my sister and cast Lay on Hands and give her five to bring her back. I haven't done anything with Lay on Hands. Or I might have done it once but I always do very small amounts. I have a total of 15 hit points cause I'm a third level-- But I've never used more than five with that spell cause it's worthless to heal. It's just good for bringing up. So I have at least 10 hit points left. - Five hit points. That's fine. I'm gonna use the rest of my movement to stand. Everyone who's down, who's down? And I don't mean dead. -Pike just got-- - Is Kima conscious? - So, we've got dead Scanlan. And that's it, I'm done. Wait, where's that egg? - It doesn't matter. I'm done, I'm done. No, no, no. Let's start a YouTube video on it. You get a tunnel for all of us, mate. Around or under? Destroying the last egg. I'm just gonna move towards the gate. Put my hand out and see if I can go through or if I get stopped. Alright, everybody! Quietly. She just wanted to talk to it. One last roll in the hay. Been nice if I'd cut out her tongue. I mean, you're gonna say, you don't know, but if J'Mon had not nurked those three attacks that round, might she have gone down? He should have stretched before the fight. -
