All right, let's do this. The song is the preference. Ooh, how hard is the difficulty up at the top? I'm thinking Applause, maybe, it's a good one. Well then, we're going to start hard then, aren't we? What other songs have we got? You Can Feel It, I love that song. In the Summertime's good too. All right, good one-- I am still feeling Gaga. Marley. Starship's good too. We're getting good ones here. Aquarius? Hold on. This may have to be the one I start with. We're going with Hair, guys. Do I step over into the red? Yep. That got a little weird. This is easy, guys, by the way. That's how much we love you guys. That's not going to be permanent on the internet or anything, right? That's a thing. 25 subs, we can do this, guys! Do the sexy shampoo commercial with the hair. Ashley is the happiest! How do you do playback on this? I love this! Aw, shit. That's amazing! That was awesome. Jesus, that score's ridiculous! (singing along) Finish it off, guys! Ash, don't leave him hanging! Oh, it's so good. If you guys do Applause, I'll jump in there with you. (singing along) Two more subs to go, guys! Yeah! (cheering) I'm going to Dungeon Master this one. Welcome to Critical Role. Pick up the phone. Yeah, Happy, what's up! Yeah! We're covered in slime! That's great. Yes! Good choice. That was good. Yeah, we're all going to sleep really fucking well tonight. Amir, I think you should dance. Oh, yeah. What is this Mario bullshit? Yeah, take it home.
