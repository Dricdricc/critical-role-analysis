Eyy! For the time being. No! To make it more-- Sure, we'll go with that! You're fine. No, I think we're just now hitting Coalinga. Yeah, you summoned it. This is your fault. Oh, it's so bad! You might want to explain to people out there what that means. Coalinga, technically. Slaughterhouses. Lot of cows. The worst. Not just cow shit. Cow shit mixed with the physical embodiment of death. I don't know, it's a terrible place. Indeed. (evil laughter) Aw! I'll call them later on. Or, "I want to go explore that abandoned building." No, that's a bad idea. I should not do that. I'll get stabbed. Yeah. Skyrim was particularly bad because you were so used to picking all the herbs and flowers everywhere that whenever you'd be driving somewhere, you'd see a nice little patch of flowers. You'd be like, "Gather!" It's bad. A generation of hoarders? Both. I would love that. I would love to see a lot of people starting their own junk-built settlements after this. It becomes like East Jesus. Pretty fantastic. This may be folly if this fails, folks. We're trying our best. As long as we have some number manipulation, that's good, but if you have any questions--! It's good. It's a good game.
