Hello everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us 000003.667 --> 000005.661 nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. 000005.661 --> 000009.957 (whooping and cheering) 000009.957 --> 000015.335 Oh, this is really bad. 000158.033 --> 000159.021 Yeah, I'm going to roll for it. All right, if it's one to ten Golden Girls. 11 to 20 Spice 000206.069 --> 000208.891 Girls. That's going to be Golden Girls. 000208.891 --> 000214.908 Much love, Yev and all our friends at Backblaze and our fantastic returning sponsor for 000255.723 --> 000301.329 this evening as well, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. In case you missed it, they've launched their new 000301.329 --> 000305.695 show, "Heroes of the Vale". We talked about it last week a bit. DMed by the fantastic Mike 000305.695 --> 000310.952 Mearls, designer of Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fifth Edition at Wizard of the Coast, amongst some of 000311.017 --> 000314.856 the great members of the team. He is DMing his own world, Nentir Vale. I'm familiar with it from 000314.856 --> 000319.630 fourth edition. It's actually a really cool world. An amazing cast-- friend of the show TJ Storm, 000319.630 --> 000324.699 Todd Kenreck, friend of ours at D&amp;D Beyond, Shelly Mazzanoble, a bunch of other amazing people on the 000324.699 --> 000329.856 show. Check it out. I think their second episode just went up recently, which is awesome. It's 000329.856 --> 000336.309 every Wednesday at 2pm Pacific time on twitch.tv/dndbeyond and you can follow it 000336.309 --> 000343.803 @DnDBeyond on Twitter as well. This is the last month to use coupon code SamIsYourHero. 000343.803 --> 000345.309 Or our hero. Sorry. SamIsOurHero. My apologies. The lettering there was-- for 25 000349.903 --> 000355.669 percent off all digital books purchases in D&amp;D Beyond there. So make sure if you're going to do 000355.669 --> 000401.906 it, take charge and utilize this fantastic opportunity. You only got a few more weeks so do 000401.906 --> 000405.217 it. (Pumat Sol voice) Do it! 000405.217 --> 000407.942 That was good. 000412.562 --> 000413.249 Exactly. (Pumat Sol voice) "It's also Pumat week here. While we're in a similar vein," (normal 000422.750 --> 000427.720 voice) so we're celebrating everything Pumat here at Critical Role. We have the new t-shirt in the 000427.720 --> 000437.449 store, which you can look at here. It's available. You can head to critrole.com. shop.critrole.com, I 000437.449 --> 000442.089 believe, to go ahead and get your t-shirt. Also, we have the new Pumat voice pack that is available 000442.089 --> 000448.599 through our friends at-- was it-- Killer Voices! Thank you. My brain-- 000448.599 --> 000449.906 Overwolf and Killer Voices. You can download the voice pack for a number of popular games. 000454.413 --> 000501.451 League of Legends, PUBG, Fortnite, DOTA 2 and as opposed to the regular announcer, you get to have 000501.451 --> 000508.150 "me tell you when you kill somebody, 'Poor fella.'" Or when you lose a match being like, "Oh, 000508.150 --> 000514.457 maybe you should have rolled a paladin." So yeah, we did a whole shit ton of variations. This 000514.457 --> 000520.436 Saturday is a video stream of me and Taliesin here playing Fortnite for the first time for both of us! 000520.511 --> 000524.519 TALIESIN and If you have played a lot of Fortnite, watch and marvel at how terrible we are at the game. 000531.248 --> 000532.760 It depends on what your goal is in playing the game-- 000538.153 --> 000539.277 If your goal was to play it and build stuff, we did that a few times. 000547.493 --> 000548.687 We had some sweet moments. We built some memories together. 000601.459 --> 000602.725 We found a bunker and we outfitted it-- 000604.207 --> 000605.527 It was beautiful. 000606.147 --> 000607.162 That would be this Saturday on twitch.tv/criticalrole. You can find all that info 000611.522 --> 000617.835 at critrole.com. All right, we also have your FPS stream coming up soon Travis on top of all that-- 000617.835 --> 000621.746 That was a look. 000708.262 --> 000709.870 Yeah, they worked it out. Thank you Travis. Excited for that. All right, and before we kick 000715.051 --> 000724.573 into tonight's episode, we have something cool to show you guys. Very happy to unveil this so I 000724.573 --> 000731.434 figure, let's go ahead and jump in. Roll the tape. 000731.434 --> 000735.480 [water bubbling] 000735.480 --> 000738.733 [thunder] 000738.733 --> 000740.766 [explosion] 000740.766 --> 000745.638 (chanting) Role! Critical! Role! 000745.638 --> 000753.268 [dramatic Critical Role theme] 000753.268 --> 000802.215 That was pretty awesome. That's our new intro guys. Travis and Sam kept this a secret from 000920.574 --> 000922.098 all of us for a long time. 000922.098 --> 000928.236 Without further ado, let's go ahead and jump in to tonight's episode of Critical Role. 001155.012 --> 001159.219 [water bubbling] 001159.219 --> 001202.519 [thunder] 001202.519 --> 001204.400 [explosion] 001204.400 --> 001210.574 (chanting) Role! Critical! Role! 001210.574 --> 001216.845 [dramatic Critical Role theme] 001216.845 --> 001225.315 And welcome back. Good job, Liam. 001335.790 --> 001339.891 So last we left off, the Mighty Nein, after being pulled through a series of pirate adjacent 001349.019 --> 001355.498 and straight up pirate adventures across the Swavain Islands here in the Lucidian ocean, on the 001355.498 --> 001401.068 ship, the Squalleater, under the Captain Avantica's rule, you made your way to Darktow 001401.068 --> 001408.630 where you attempted to find a way to discredit her. Find a way to not be dragged into her 001408.630 --> 001415.620 business in the future. It got a little messy but you managed to avoid it coming to too terrible a 001415.620 --> 001422.033 head until you are brought into her ship last week where a battle unfolded, in which most of you 001422.033 --> 001427.939 managed to skitter away with the contents of this journal that you had taken from her as well as the 001427.939 --> 001434.437 translation for the cipher that was used to write it. Managed to make your way to the Plank King in 001434.437 --> 001442.603 time and have him bring his resources to the docks before any more of you could be further destroyed. 001442.603 --> 001450.434 Summoning a demon helped as part of the distraction, as well as patiently waiting. Some 001450.434 --> 001458.440 quick thought process moments. You guys did pretty damn well. You managed to just break enough laws 001458.440 --> 001506.874 to be put not in favor of the Plank King but managed to have done a large favor enough to be 001506.874 --> 001512.890 let leave and never return. Taking the hobbled ship that you guys had busted with you, you made 001512.890 --> 001519.822 your way out into the open ocean, heading northeast from Darktow and the Dragshallow Reef, 001519.822 --> 001528.541 in search of the possible shipwreck that started Fjord's destiny in the direction of Uk'otoa. After 001528.541 --> 001539.220 days of travel and a few location spells cast, you managed to find a blip at the base of the sea. 001539.220 --> 001547.561 Using your newfound ability to instill the ability to breathe water within the party around you, you 001547.561 --> 001554.442 sunk to the bottom, holding onto cannonballs, and began to walk the bottom floor in search of the 001554.442 --> 001603.960 shipwreck, eventually coming upon a valley caldera that slowly sinks down. You noticed, aside from 001603.960 --> 001611.951 the whale that just skimmed your presence, the bow of a derelict, wrecked ship sitting there, 001611.951 --> 001619.069 surrounded by seaweed in the barely-visible, creeping daylight making it this deep in the 001619.069 --> 001629.716 waters. So with your lights aglow and the wreck before you, Mighty Nein, what do you want to do? 001631.188 --> 001634.234 We'll get to that because there was a note left here on my table that I almost forgot because 001739.971 --> 001747.437 the game has started. This was written and left behind by Logic as he passed through earlier. It 001747.437 --> 001750.031 says, "Flip over and read as soon as the game starts." 001750.031 --> 001751.496 "You, Sir Matt, are the sexiest being in all of Neverland. Sincerely, your boo, Logic." 001759.149 --> 001803.094 (laughter) 001803.094 --> 001804.371 Thank you, buddy. 001807.364 --> 001810.211 Yeah, I know. Loading the gun against you guys for the game tonight. It'd be pretty funny. 001813.922 --> 001816.116 There you go. 001817.011 --> 001819.506 Make a perception check. 001832.062 --> 001833.546 With disadvantage because there's no light here, and it's a very short range, I'd say. 001841.567 --> 001844.082 Because you guys extinguished all your lights when the-- 001844.082 --> 001845.267 If you want to. 001849.226 --> 001852.341 With disadvantage? 001902.260 --> 001903.621 Because you do not have darkvision, and it's very dark under here, and the distance is very 001909.438 --> 001911.298 short. You don't have any lights up. 001911.298 --> 001912.206 You extinguished them when the whale came by. You can put the lights back on if you want. 001915.876 --> 001917.438 That's true, you do have darkvision. 001920.336 --> 001921.412 Okay, there you go. Six. 001922.911 --> 001923.890 12. Okay. 001925.081 --> 001926.560 Got you. Eyes of the Grave, you don't sense anything gathering your attention as you attempt 001931.293 --> 001938.303 to reach out your essence to feel for any undead presence. Nothing. But the very cold waters here 001938.303 --> 001946.756 beneath still keep you a bit chilled. It is very cold down here. Looking around best you can with 001946.820 --> 001955.259 the lack of light, aside from the swaying bits of seaweed that are all fluttering up and slowly 001955.259 --> 002000.751 swaying, reaching up hundreds and hundreds of feet before the darkness takes them, you see the bow of 002000.751 --> 002005.267 that wrecked ship. Not much else catches your attention. 002005.267 --> 002007.804 It's the Tide's Breadth. 002013.759 --> 002014.925 Perception check with Frumpkin. 002042.987 --> 002048.376 Still a shipwreck. There is a shipwreck ahead of you guys. 002052.182 --> 002056.639 As you do step across the surface of the sea floor, there are bits of the silt and sediment 002102.444 --> 002106.277 that clouds around your foot with each footfall. 002106.277 --> 002112.639 Okay. 002129.676 --> 002134.433 Yes. So you take, and you tip it back. The thing is, in order for the liquid to leave the 002142.196 --> 002149.466 vessel, you have to send air to occupy the space; there's a transition there. But you're breathing 002149.466 --> 002153.097 water, so it will mix water with whatever's in there. 002153.097 --> 002154.401 I mean, you're not having to siphon it like gasoline! As soon as you open it, it begins to 002214.983 --> 002221.995 diffuse into the nearby sea. It's very briny alcohol. 002221.995 --> 002227.234 This darkened cloud is filling around Nott's face. 002231.146 --> 002237.467 You guys begin to approach, stepping carefully towards the base of this. The ship, 002313.943 --> 002320.827 where it's sitting, it's resting at an odd angle, the front of it, the bow slightly angled upward. 002320.827 --> 002331.092 You can see the side where this large explosion tore through the hull. Already, for as long as 002331.092 --> 002337.907 it's been there, which has not been but a year maybe, tops, you can see the rust and the 002337.907 --> 002345.498 barnacles beginning to gather and claim the shipwreck to join. But that's best you can make 002345.498 --> 002349.173 out with the lack of light down here. 002351.645 --> 002355.844 You'd probably have to go around a little bit, but yeah. You walk around the opposite side 002419.451 --> 002424.848 of it. Looking in, you can see there's some damage. You can see there are holes blown out on 002424.848 --> 002429.319 the side that you were facing. As you curve around, you can see where there's a large, gaping 002429.319 --> 002432.394 hole in the side of the cargo hold. 002432.394 --> 002440.388 You did hear tale of him passing through Nicodranas not too long ago. 002624.434 --> 002626.471 As you guys have gotten closer to around the side of the ship where the most extensive damage 002658.266 --> 002705.207 was taken, you can see where the top of the deck and the edges are blackened from a fire that broke 002705.207 --> 002711.543 out, probably during or shortly after the explosion, but before it sank fully. The edges of 002711.543 --> 002715.611 the cargo hold that are blown open-- as soon as you begin to peer in the inside, you can see the 002715.611 --> 002721.304 interior is blackened as well, amongst the other patches of sea life that have begun to reclaim it 002721.304 --> 002730.483 as a home, and bits of seaweed, and general sea vegetation that has begun to find its way inside 002730.483 --> 002731.863 the empty ship. 002731.863 --> 002739.257 Make a perception check. 002754.167 --> 002757.230 <i>Nein.</i> As you begin to swim into the darkened interior, holding the sword in front of 002802.009 --> 002810.647 you, it doesn't seem to react, adjust, or give you any sense that it is able to guide you in any 002810.647 --> 002813.843 particular direction. 002813.843 --> 002820.696 Okay. Frumpkin's octopus form makes his way into the cargo hold of the Tide's Breadth 002844.286 --> 002849.067 wreckage. Go ahead and roll a perception check for Frumpkin and take a look around. 002850.500 --> 002856.074 Unfortunately, there's so little light down here, even for the darkvision. There's the basic 002902.554 --> 002910.390 outline of the interior hold. Frumpkin can notice the outline of pieces of broken crates and other 002910.390 --> 002916.996 elements that may have once been stored within the ship, but very little detail is visible. 002916.996 --> 002920.970 Well, if you haven't yet, then you'll be doing it now. 002952.303 --> 002954.147 One way to find out. 002955.355 --> 002956.982 Okay. It emanates and lights up the immediate vicinity. The balls don't give off a lot 003016.928 --> 003021.782 of light; they're not torchlight, in comparison. They work in conjunction to create a larger space 003021.782 --> 003030.802 of light, but it does help a little bit. With that benefit, looking in the space, you can see there 003030.802 --> 003039.587 are no bodies. There are no signs of any individuals who were on this ship, but you also 003039.587 --> 003044.957 know from your experience on the sea that those who die at sea usually float to the surface. 003044.957 --> 003047.911 Yes. You do see some metallic materials that have grown rusted. You can see the shattered 003054.984 --> 003101.381 crates that I mentioned before. A lot of them are burned and destroyed. As Frumpkin drifts past one 003101.381 --> 003107.688 of them, you look inside. There may have been some metal bars or some sort of a construction-type 003107.688 --> 003113.971 iron material, but it's mostly melted and fused together. In fact, as Frumpkin makes his way 003113.971 --> 003117.488 around, all the elements of metal that were immediately in the vicinity-- it looks like there 003117.488 --> 003123.209 was a cannon. There were some other bits of-- all you can make out is debris at this point, but 003123.209 --> 003128.573 other things that were metallic in nature that have since bowed and fused from the heat of the 003128.573 --> 003132.041 explosion and the fire than ensued thereafter before it sank. 003132.041 --> 003137.049 Now because you guys don't have air in your lungs, you're not buoyant, to the point where 003215.170 --> 003218.673 you're not fighting weight. It brought you to the bottom easier, so you didn't have to swim your way 003218.673 --> 003223.806 underneath, but now you're here, the cannonball is unnecessary to weigh you down. 003223.806 --> 003226.026 Essentially. You arc over, and you land on the deck. For a moment as you glance around, it's 003233.212 --> 003240.048 very spooky to be back in this familiar place in a very different setting. It's a strange, ghost-ship 003240.048 --> 003245.109 type chill that runs up your back, looking around and having flash memories of pulling up the anchor 003245.109 --> 003251.440 on that side, and having conversations over that edge at sea. You and Vandren having a deep 003251.440 --> 003254.564 conversation there under the main mast. 003255.764 --> 003259.559 Okay. You swim through the door. It's currently open, and the hinges rusted and pulled 003309.605 --> 003316.656 off, and the tops of the doors broken and akimbo. You make your way into the darkened interior 003316.656 --> 003324.719 chamber. The door to Vandren's chamber is closed. What do you want to do? 003324.719 --> 003326.699 Yeah, go for it. Roll, let's say, a perception, to see if you see anything strange or 003350.998 --> 003353.040 out of the ordinary. 003353.040 --> 003354.295 14. Doesn't look like there are any traps affixed to the door. 003358.247 --> 003400.886 There's a bit of a rust resistance, but you're pretty beefy. You shove it with your 003407.449 --> 003412.501 shoulder, and it opens up. You can see all the silt get kicked off and slowly cloud the space 003412.501 --> 003415.044 around it as you push the door open. 003415.044 --> 003417.540 You step through and look inside. You see the familiar quarters of Vandren, though they look tossed. 003425.290 --> 003427.415 As you look inside, there's the table where he normally sat and read his books. That table is 003435.465 --> 003442.546 set over; the shelf is pushed over. Looks like most everything in here has been, in some way, 003442.546 --> 003448.615 shape, or form, tossed. You remember there being all sorts of decorations that he kept in here, 003448.615 --> 003456.095 metal candle holders. It's all missing. 003456.095 --> 003458.845 At first glance. 003500.258 --> 003505.853 Make a perception check. 003508.368 --> 003511.751 Oh, buddy. 003514.889 --> 003516.319 You just stand in the doorway, as opposed to doing a thorough investigation of the room, and 003523.729 --> 003530.597 glance around, and begin tying memories and moments, and getting lost in that headspace. You 003530.597 --> 003535.226 do a not-very-thorough check over the interior. 003535.226 --> 003541.754 Okay, you're doing a thorough investigation of the interior? Roll an investigation check as 003644.277 --> 003647.701 you rummage through the wreckage. 003648.581 --> 003650.167 Okay. Looking through and moving some things aside because you're a sturdy tiefling, pushing 003658.773 --> 003706.476 things out of the way while you're off, you glance underneath the table in the far left corner. You 003706.476 --> 003719.769 see a reinforced metal box, somewhat melted along one edge, just faintly. It's left open. The lock 003719.769 --> 003726.897 mechanism on it appears to have been broken by brute force. Where it was forced open, there are 003726.897 --> 003734.015 some heavy claw marks along the edges where the metal itself looks scarred. The interior, as you 003734.015 --> 003740.385 pull it open and look inside, is set with a leather recess on each side, top and bottom, soft 003740.385 --> 003749.593 leather with two halves that are somewhat spherical, like to hold a small apple. 003749.593 --> 003804.116 Yeah. You cast Locate Object, concentrating on the orb. Let me have a quick glance at this. 003824.568 --> 003829.136 All right. 003830.844 --> 003834.509 Okay, so you're not looking for the orb that Fjord has, something similar to it? 003845.969 --> 003846.666 Okay. You do suddenly acknowledge-- your head pulls at the back of your skull, and you 003855.103 --> 003859.120 glance over your shoulder away from the ship. 003859.120 --> 003901.352 Just as everyone else returns and comes in the chamber. 003906.814 --> 003907.541 (slurping) The tentacles wrap around and grasp. 004003.224 --> 004005.111 It's like a reverse facehugger. 004009.616 --> 004011.291 Roughly, the direction you know, you sense it's probably between seven to eight hundred feet 004027.714 --> 004029.375 from your current location. 004029.375 --> 004035.592 Okay. 004041.829 --> 004043.360 Make an investigation check. 004102.495 --> 004105.917 Make a nature check. 004120.359 --> 004123.275 Okay. 004126.316 --> 004127.025 Okay. Looking at it, the claw marks are probably roughly an inch to an inch and a half 004135.416 --> 004141.089 apart, and there's four of them. It looks like an indentation for a thumb across one side, almost 004141.089 --> 004146.734 like whoever was grabbing it was pulling it open this way and, as they pulled it open, their 004146.734 --> 004150.009 fingers scratched across the metal as it bent and broke open. 004150.009 --> 004150.910 As you guys finish doing your once-over of the chamber, you find a false shelf bottom under 004220.212 --> 004227.502 one of the bookcases that was toppled over. As you pull inside, it looks like it may have been what 004227.502 --> 004235.128 this box was inside. It has been pulled open and broken, the wood compartment partially shattered 004235.128 --> 004241.317 in the front. Looking through, this room has been pretty ransacked. 004241.317 --> 004244.060 Yeah, what remains of the handful of bound leather tomes in the vicinity have mostly joined 004251.264 --> 004252.519 the muck at the bottom of the ocean. 004252.519 --> 004254.171 Okay. Going through, you go through a number of cabins, chambers. This isn't an incredibly 004313.870 --> 004322.235 massive ship. It was mainly used for sailing and for transport. It's strange for you to go back, 004322.235 --> 004329.013 once again, following through Caduceus and looking and finding your old chambers as well. A lot of 004329.013 --> 004338.137 the rooms from the explosion have been destroyed. Because of your generally perceptive persona, you 004338.137 --> 004344.413 can see elements where this explosion happened. There are stains of individuals that may have been 004344.413 --> 004346.769 in the proximity, but no sign of their bodies. 004346.769 --> 004347.659 You begin to piece together the power and the source of this detonation, and you get caught 004356.229 --> 004400.914 up slightly thumbing through the memories and remembering the people and the faces that used to 004400.914 --> 004411.828 serve on this ship with you. Remembering the room where Sabian stayed. Wondering, if Sabian 004411.828 --> 004418.547 survived, who else may have? But he also was the one jumping from the deck when the explosion hit. 004418.547 --> 004427.982 Everything has been cleaned out. This appears salvaged. Somebody has come through here and taken 004427.982 --> 004429.553 from the interior. 004429.553 --> 004435.201 I mean, there are a number of creatures of folklore and things that are greedy no matter 004500.474 --> 004502.565 where they live. 004502.565 --> 004504.312 Make a history check. 004507.886 --> 004510.618 I mean, there was one other time that you encountered creatures that seemed to be gathering 004524.512 --> 004534.856 and hoarding things that were shiny and happened to be affiliated with underwater existence. 004534.856 --> 004536.304 Where are you exiting? 004548.185 --> 004554.974 Okay, make a perception check for me. 004557.358 --> 004600.332 In your excitement in having this thread of possibility towards recovering this third and 004626.163 --> 004633.563 final orb, from what you understand, you immediately turn around and swim and dart outward 004633.563 --> 004640.145 towards where the deck is, into the open waters, just as your eyes clarify to see three large 004640.145 --> 004646.967 figures that are floating about 20 or so feet ahead that seems to have encircled the deck. In 004646.967 --> 004651.644 but a split second, you can immediately make out their outline. You can see the sides of the 004651.644 --> 004658.603 frilled head. You can see the long, fish-like lower torso, and you can see the familiar tridents 004658.603 --> 004700.413 with chains affixed to the edge. 004700.413 --> 004703.046 Let's roll initiative. 004705.992 --> 004707.443 It seems that, in these darkened waters, light sources can be very easy to see. 004713.819 --> 004716.384 It came like this, busted up. 004749.527 --> 004751.047 LAURA and Marching order, if you don't mind, of who was behind Fjord. 004754.903 --> 004756.551 Yasha probably right behind there. 004804.096 --> 004806.545 All right. Caleb takes the rear. 004809.063 --> 004814.229 Beau said she was behind Yasha. 004818.062 --> 004820.001 That's up to you. Fine. Caduceus inside there. All right, then there's Beau. And Nott? 004828.105 --> 004831.058 Chilling with Caleb. All right. 004833.100 --> 004835.688 Initiative order, please. 25 to 20, anyone? 004902.129 --> 004903.954 20 to 15? 004906.643 --> 004907.631 Yasha got 17? All right. 004912.566 --> 004914.239 All right. Then 15 for Beau and Jester? All right. 15 to ten? 004924.874 --> 004925.620 14 for Fjord. 004927.221 --> 004930.978 All right, ten to five? 004932.481 --> 004933.957 All right. 004936.959 --> 004938.568 Caduceus? 004940.050 --> 004940.886 All righty. 004943.134 --> 004948.291 Great. Top of the round, first up is Yasha. 004954.078 --> 004959.733 Everyone's speed is halved underwater. 005004.979 --> 005006.152 Except yours. 005007.021 --> 005012.195 Her movement speed is 40, right? 005029.419 --> 005030.234 20 feet would get her almost into melee with this one. 005036.981 --> 005037.892 Yeah, just outside of it. 005041.336 --> 005050.562 All right, so rage. Then she can use her action to dash and move again if she's not 005056.021 --> 005057.445 attacking with it. 005057.445 --> 005059.515 All right, she gets into melee with that figure there. You got it. That finishes Yasha's 005103.532 --> 005106.350 go. Beau and Jester, your turns. 005106.350 --> 005107.855 All right. Against which one? 005113.525 --> 005117.420 Okay, go for it. Roll for an attack. 005119.138 --> 005121.930 Sure. 005124.334 --> 005128.479 16 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that one. 005133.904 --> 005135.614 Slightly Norse. 005145.635 --> 005147.173 Nice! That one, next attack on it has advantage. 005155.489 --> 005156.238 As Yasha says that, Jester glances over, puts her hand out. This sparkling, radiant light 005202.272 --> 005207.655 goes through the water, leaving this vacuum trail behind as the bolt slams into the merrow, 005207.655 --> 005212.437 brightening up around its chest with the impact of the magical energy. Now its form is glittering 005212.437 --> 005217.754 with that light, making it very easy to spot its location. Do you want to move or stay where you are? 005217.754 --> 005220.610 Back up back inside? 005223.653 --> 005226.965 You move inside the chamber there. Okay. 005229.840 --> 005233.918 You got it. That ends your turn. Beau, what are you doing? 005240.419 --> 005247.751 You have 25 feet. You can get right up to it. I'll shift these guys here a little bit to 005253.101 --> 005255.194 make a space for it where they were. 005255.194 --> 005258.262 Is your speed 50, then? 005308.580 --> 005310.720 Oh, got you. So it would be 20 feet because you round down in D&amp;D unless it specially says 005314.133 --> 005316.744 otherwise. So you'd be just out of range. 005316.744 --> 005319.789 All right, that'll get you the distance you need there. 005321.508 --> 005325.366 (singing) Do it! 005326.753 --> 005331.808 22 hits. 005333.322 --> 005337.372 Ten points of damage. You have advantage on that attack, by the way, because of the Guiding Bolt. 005342.288 --> 005348.618 You do not have advantage on that one. Only the first one. 005356.300 --> 005358.087 MARISHA and Oh, got you. 005358.849 --> 005401.182 12 misses, unfortunately. The first strike manages to clock it in the face. However, as you 005405.732 --> 005410.418 go to swing backward, the water resistance in itself-- which, actually, this is a good point of 005410.418 --> 005415.464 order. Remember, you're underwater. Remember this going forward; melee attacks and weapon attacks 005415.464 --> 005416.840 have disadvantage. 005416.840 --> 005418.641 (groaning) 005418.641 --> 005428.190 A melee weapon attack. Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss if they're beyond the normal 005435.984 --> 005441.537 range. The attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that's 005441.537 --> 005445.827 thrown like a javelin. So technically, Nott, your attacks are fine underwater. 005445.827 --> 005447.038 Magic attacks are fine, but melee weapon attacks have disadvantage. 005450.356 --> 005453.243 You've already used your bonus action to-- 005502.122 --> 005505.958 No worries. After the resistance of the water keeps your blow from coming with too much 005510.594 --> 005519.304 impact, the merrow spins to you. As its jaw opens, there's the rows of tiny, sharp teeth. It's creepy 005519.304 --> 005524.242 when it's right in front of you. These are similar, but different than the ones you fought 005524.242 --> 005529.334 before up at the swamp. These have longer, more sallow features. They seem to be a little bit more 005529.334 --> 005535.504 ocean-based, and as such, there's a variation to how they look. That finishes Jester's and Beau's 005535.504 --> 005537.352 turn. Fjord, you're up. 005537.352 --> 005545.175 Go for it. 005553.713 --> 005558.035 SAM and Both hit! 005604.226 --> 005618.193 It gets hit twice in the chest. It tries to loop around now. You can see the shapes against 005623.190 --> 005628.420 the little bit of light you can see from the surface above, but it's still very dark in the 005628.420 --> 005630.555 vicinity aside from the globes he has behind. 005630.555 --> 005636.464 Oh, so you cursed that guy? 005638.520 --> 005645.504 You going to stay in the doorway or move into the chamber? 005653.964 --> 005655.370 All right. One step into the room? 005658.853 --> 005659.791 Okay, so you'd still be there. 005701.359 --> 005705.608 Okay, so you probably move that way then. That ends your go. That brings us to their turn. 005711.026 --> 005711.991 This one right there in the front, it's going to make-- let's see here. 005718.112 --> 005720.109 One bite with its claw and one with its bite against, I'm going to say you, since you're the 005726.003 --> 005729.437 only one who actually managed to connect with it physically. As you rush up into its face and slam 005729.437 --> 005734.678 it once, the other attack misses as it curves under. It goes (snarling). Its jaw opens to try 005734.678 --> 005737.019 and snap towards your shoulder and neck area. 005737.019 --> 005738.577 No, they do not because they both have sentinel. We have to remember that! 005743.124 --> 005744.319 Yeah, if they both have sentinel, they can't bounce attacks. We kept forgetting that in the past. 005748.273 --> 005749.717 Because the combination becomes super broken. That's going to be a-- 005757.877 --> 005801.734 19 to hit. 005803.100 --> 005804.410 All right, and then the claw attack. Ooh, that's going to be a 22 to hit. You suffer from 005811.567 --> 005815.830 the bite attack nine points of piercing damage. 005815.830 --> 005817.561 Then the claws deal ten points of slashing damage. 005824.187 --> 005825.469 It's going to attempt to move out of the way of each of you because it doesn't know any better. 005831.851 --> 005837.913 It has a swim speed of 40 feet, so it's going to attempt to pull back to get some range. You each 005837.913 --> 005839.586 technically get an attack of opportunity on it. 005839.586 --> 005840.841 It's hoping. Disadvantage on each attack. 005842.895 --> 005844.685 You can't make-- reckless you have to do on your turn, I think. 005846.987 --> 005850.144 What was the other? 005851.839 --> 005859.124 14 hits. 005903.042 --> 005905.316 MARISHA and Reckless attack When you make your first attack on your turn. So you have to choose it on 005911.284 --> 005912.051 your turn. 005912.051 --> 005914.200 19 still hits! Yeah. You both can attack, and it does not move. It tries to pull away, and-- 005917.961 --> 005920.898 There you go. See, now it pays off. 005922.185 --> 005924.910 It tries to back away, hoping that the water itself will help protect it to pull away. Nuh-uh. 005934.368 --> 005938.810 The two ladies are not going to let it flee. Whack! One hit from Beau as Yasha, through the 005938.810 --> 005942.571 water, carves with the greatsword, Magician's Judge, hitting across the chest. You can see this 005942.571 --> 005949.388 deep red cloud form around its chest as it tries to pull away. You hold it in place, unable to escape. 005949.388 --> 005951.043 There you go. 005952.507 --> 005955.548 This one that's hexed is going to move down towards the deck. It'll glance through and it sees 010001.776 --> 010014.568 Caleb. It's going to move in a little closer to Caleb and as it pulls its harpoon back, it throws 010014.568 --> 010020.818 it forward towards you. It's going to attempt to harpoon you, Caleb. That is a 19 to hit. 010020.818 --> 010022.631 (groaning) 010022.631 --> 010024.885 You take 11 points of piercing damage. I'm going to need you to make a strength check. 010033.895 --> 010035.368 It's contested. 010039.590 --> 010042.929 Yeah. You get pulled out of the interior. 010048.095 --> 010049.327 11. 010052.642 --> 010054.942 Nope! Caleb stands there in the back, looking, and all of a sudden (impacts) into his 010100.530 --> 010105.725 chest. The thing pierces in the stomach area there and then gets pulled out. You try to reach for 010105.725 --> 010114.968 him, but he's already gone and he gets pulled out in the middle of the open area. From there, comes 010114.968 --> 010116.577 the shallow priest's turn. 010116.577 --> 010118.401 The shallow priest is going to move down and it's going to move to there. It's going to attempt 010143.908 --> 010149.925 to harpoon Caleb out of the other one's grasp as well. It's trying to chain pull you away. That's 010149.925 --> 010152.747 going to be a 17 to hit. 010152.747 --> 010153.920 The harpoon ricochets off of the Shield and goes limp. The creature pulls on the chain as it 010202.259 --> 010206.664 falls back into its grasp. It's currently clutching its staff in the other hand and it's 010206.664 --> 010214.626 going to pull back for the rest of its movement there out of the vicinity. That's going to end 010214.626 --> 010216.960 their turn. Now it comes to Nott. 010216.960 --> 010229.945 Oh, gotcha! It's a wisdom saving throw? 010308.533 --> 010311.505 The one that currently has Caleb. That is going to be a 12. Success! 010318.485 --> 010327.007 The harpoon that pulled Caleb in has been pulled out of the wound and there's a little bit 010336.796 --> 010341.107 of blood that's now trailing from the initial impact. Caleb is not currently held or grappled. 010341.107 --> 010342.807 It's just not in his face. 010342.807 --> 010344.367 Not at this moment. When it pulled him in, it pulled it out of his body, but it's right in 010347.043 --> 010348.102 front of him. 010348.102 --> 010353.067 You can't quite get up to him, unfortunately. Because it's 15 feet underwater. 010359.392 --> 010405.136 Your speed of 30 is reduced to 15, and it took 15 feet to get far out. You could, as a bonus 010405.136 --> 010408.769 action, dash to move up to him, but you can't pull him back because you don't have an action to try 010408.769 --> 010409.518 and grab. 010409.518 --> 010421.445 I'll say make a strength check. 010424.980 --> 010429.732 Yes. 010431.064 --> 010436.230 You feel this small push on your shoulder and you see Nott drift upside down in front of you. As 010447.403 --> 010457.460 the merrow who pulled you in with this terrible, toothy grimace and starts going (chuckling) and is 010457.460 --> 010505.059 bowling over, chuckling. It's a weird moment. That finishes Nott's go. Caleb, you're up. 010505.059 --> 010507.240 That one is incapacitated. 010508.612 --> 010510.098 No, he's just held in place. 010512.436 --> 010523.973 All righty. 010527.735 --> 010530.144 Concentrating, both of you guys. Wisdom saving throw. That's a failure on the shallow 010549.895 --> 010555.726 priest and the one that's over there rolled an 18. So that's incapacitated is fine with the Slow; 010555.726 --> 010557.799 however, the shallow priest is slowed. 010557.799 --> 010602.200 Correct. If it tries to cast a spell, it takes a full round back before it can even hit. 010609.752 --> 010620.822 You just manage to get back inside of the chamber. The doorway's still open. All right, that 010625.719 --> 010628.067 finishes your go. Caduceus, you're up. 010628.067 --> 010629.543 Nope. 010649.318 --> 010650.681 One has to be cantrip and the other can be any level. 010652.601 --> 010657.911 You have five more of feet in movement there, stepping out of the doorway. 010706.718 --> 010718.765 Yeah. 010731.516 --> 010735.201 You can move five more feet, you might. You have to eyeball it and may take the risk. 010739.568 --> 010746.392 (counting) I'll say with the angle, 30, he's just within range. 010752.473 --> 010755.480 Nope! That's a fail. One in the middle, that's a ten, that's a fail. Over here, that's a 010815.362 --> 010817.953 five. That's a fail. They all have a minus one on their charisma. 010817.953 --> 010829.620 Not bad for a 1st-level spell. It doesn't get a lot of love. 010831.591 --> 010833.733 The water around seems to get even darker for a moment and ice crystals begin to form at the 010841.518 --> 010846.159 edge of their bodies as the chill becomes unnatural and begins sluggishly shift their 010846.159 --> 010851.819 movements, this cleric spell sending itself into their form. That finishes your turn? 010851.819 --> 010853.753 Finishing that up, we can do the top of the round. Yasha's up first. 010856.887 --> 010902.392 Go for it. Yasha, by the way, is no longer raging. She wasn't attacked or didn't-- Oh no, but 010911.786 --> 010916.030 she did get an attack of opportunity, so she would be. You're correct. 010916.030 --> 010917.645 That hits. 010918.471 --> 010920.330 Yeah, both hit. 010921.962 --> 010929.272 First blow, as she swings by, carves through as it goes taut for a second, all of its muscle 010936.935 --> 010941.003 seizing, and then goes limp as its torso begins to drift away from the lower half of its fish body 010941.003 --> 010943.828 and it begins to slowly float off. 010943.828 --> 010950.123 Right now, you still have the second attack. It depends on the movement you have and I don't 010953.716 --> 010955.923 what else you can get in range for. 010955.923 --> 010959.280 Did you roll disadvantage on that attack, by the way? 011001.613 --> 011006.612 I would say that gets you right about there. You'd be just in range for the one that's incapacitated. 011013.728 --> 011015.549 Yeah. 011016.431 --> 011017.808 It's just a-- down, it swims down. 011020.132 --> 011021.689 Yeah, reroll for this one. 011023.375 --> 011024.081 17 hits! 011025.434 --> 011031.246 12 points of slashing damage. 011034.659 --> 011036.924 Well, this is Yasha's turn. 011039.217 --> 011041.308 For your Tasha's Hideous Laughter, I believe it gets to make a saving throw when it takes 011044.505 --> 011046.132 damage, is that correct? 011046.132 --> 011050.806 That is a natural 18. 011054.675 --> 011056.650 That's right, yes. 011057.836 --> 011100.660 Okay, the advantage didn't help it. 011103.534 --> 011107.878 Ooh, minus four brings it to 14. 011109.382 --> 011110.700 So it still resists it. 011112.610 --> 011114.241 It reduced it to 14 but 14 was the DC. 011117.181 --> 011119.297 All right. 011127.449 --> 011129.025 That finishes that go. All righty, Yasha's turn's done. Beau and Jester. 011132.499 --> 011138.189 You don't need to, you can get there-- 011139.373 --> 011140.424 Oh, I see. 011141.753 --> 011143.244 You would have to Step of the Wind to get to him. 011149.162 --> 011151.287 Okay, go ahead and attempt that. 011155.960 --> 011157.506 Yeah, no, that hits. 011201.733 --> 011203.063 (splat noise) 011206.598 --> 011209.076 12 points of damage to the shallow priest, you got it. 011215.357 --> 011217.279 With that, you move forward, swimming through the water, and then Step of the Wind, use 011223.130 --> 011227.403 another ki point to get up there, fists at the ready. 011227.403 --> 011228.888 22 hits. 011234.161 --> 011239.752 Nine points of damage on that one. 011242.262 --> 011245.244 Well, that first one should have been just a regular roll. Did you roll with advantage? 011249.298 --> 011250.500 Just roll once for the first attack for me again real fast. 011253.135 --> 011258.533 There you go. For the second attack, it's disadvantage. 011301.019 --> 011305.215 17 still hits! 011306.390 --> 011310.567 There you go, nine and nine! You swim forward, rocketing forward, Aquaman-style, and 011316.149 --> 011324.498 then two big hits to its face. The shallow priest takes the impact, but its body reacts slowly. The 011324.498 --> 011330.477 spell that's surrounding it is forcing it to move and shift at half the pace it normally would. 011330.477 --> 011335.246 Like rack focuses, from Beau's middle finger to Jester's middle finger. Perfect, all right. 011344.670 --> 011347.792 That finishes Beau's go. Fjord, you're up. 011347.792 --> 011353.538 Oh no, you can because you don't have to worry about it. 011401.620 --> 011406.454 Correct. 011407.303 --> 011411.155 That hits. 011412.365 --> 011419.527 11 to hit? 011421.057 --> 011421.902 That misses, unfortunately. As the first one carves through, the bloody cloud that's forming 011429.043 --> 011433.090 from the wounds it's sustaining gets thicker and bigger. It's looking pretty hurt. 011433.090 --> 011433.966 That finishes your turn? 011435.311 --> 011435.846 Now it's their turn. All right. The shallow priest, who is currently slowed, is going to use 011451.966 --> 011455.869 its action to do its multiattack, so that's two attacks on you with its bite and claw. It's not 011455.869 --> 011457.906 going to use any of its spells. 011457.906 --> 011459.853 No, that's right. It doesn't get multiattack when it's slowed. 011502.089 --> 011503.015 Then it's going to harpoon you. It's not going to bother with the claw and the bite. It's 011506.052 --> 011510.247 going to pull back with its one harpoon and try and thrust it into your chest. 011510.247 --> 011511.496 Yes. 011512.073 --> 011513.192 Correct. That's two off of it; that brings it from 19 to 17. What's your armor class? 011519.895 --> 011520.715 The Bane prevents it from hitting you. As it goes and thrusts the harpoon forward, it 011528.401 --> 011534.304 telegraphs it just enough that, as it leaves, you (whoosh). It nicks the very edge of your skin, 011534.304 --> 011536.372 ever so slightly, and that's it. 011536.372 --> 011539.814 It's going to attempt to move away. 011546.531 --> 011548.168 Go for it. Roll for an attack. 011553.302 --> 011554.619 Yep. 011555.213 --> 011558.669 Correct. It would have a swim speed of 40 underwater, so it can only go 20. It manages to 011608.225 --> 011611.706 pull out of the range up there, and at the end of its turn, it gets to-- 011611.706 --> 011612.774 Both of them make a save because they're both-- well, that one, no. That one missed the 011615.103 --> 011619.990 Slow. That is a 11 plus three, 14. 011619.990 --> 011621.800 Minus four, ten. Yeah, it's still slowed. 011628.028 --> 011629.486 It's starting to turn around, too, seeing how things shifted here. It saw the light, and you 011635.713 --> 011640.935 can see what little bit of his expression underwater at this point. They followed this light 011640.935 --> 011647.070 to inspect it, thought they had an ambush on a creature, and suddenly this party emerged. Now, 011647.070 --> 011651.441 well, that one's in a really rough spot. This one is looking like it's about to turn and try and flee. 011651.441 --> 011659.625 That's going to end the shallow priest's turn and the other one's turn. I haven't done that one yet, 011659.625 --> 011705.008 right? That one is going to attempt to use its harpoon against you, Fjord. 011705.008 --> 011705.741 Since you ran up and carved at it. Or, yeah, it's going to try that. That's a natural 20. 011713.084 --> 011717.658 It's just not a critical hit. 011719.489 --> 011720.664 Your ability, you're talking about? 011722.029 --> 011725.601 It would still be a critical hit for a natural 20, but it would then be a total of-- it 011737.013 --> 011738.316 would be a 22 still. 011738.316 --> 011740.016 You use Channel Divinity once to cancel the critical on that. As the harpoon comes towards 011744.938 --> 011752.889 you, there's this slight, dull green barrier that seems to slow the penetration of the immediate 011752.889 --> 011757.659 lightning-fast pace of this harpoon. It manages to carve into the front of your armor and pierce 011757.659 --> 011801.922 through ever so slightly. It's not a critical hit, unfortunately. 011801.922 --> 011802.726 That's 11 points of piercing damage to you. After it carves through and wounds you, it pushes 011811.708 --> 011815.992 through the other way, and you manage to roll off. It would've been far worse damage if Caduceus 011815.992 --> 011821.978 hadn't helped you in that moment. It's going to attempt to move away. Yasha gets attack of opportunity. 011821.978 --> 011825.160 Right, because it is now reckless. 011827.144 --> 011833.228 That'll hit. 011834.373 --> 011836.014 No, because you were pushing him. You weren't moving in that area, so you're not quite 011839.492 --> 011840.553 in melee with him. 011840.553 --> 011846.715 14 points of damage. It turns around and darts, and Yasha just (whoosh), one swipe with her 011850.826 --> 011856.924 sword. She's finishing them off left and right. 011856.924 --> 011859.440 Ashley, come back! 011901.338 --> 011904.680 MARISHA and That finishes the merrow's turn. It did not go well for them in that brief instance. Nott, 011911.855 --> 011913.332 you're up. 011913.332 --> 011915.647 Yeah. Your crossbow actually-- 011917.530 --> 011919.582 They're probably about 40 or so feet from you. 011933.009 --> 011938.219 Actually, crossbow does not get hit with that problem because they're piercing. However, 012000.310 --> 012004.334 what's your inside range? It's 30 feet? 012004.334 --> 012005.196 Then yeah, as long as you're inside range, then you're fine. You swim up there towards it, as 012009.563 --> 012014.483 you're kicking your feet and cocking the bolt back into it, and go to aim, just within range. You see 012014.483 --> 012017.902 it as it's turning around to attempt to swim away at full speed. 012017.902 --> 012019.437 That hits. 012052.685 --> 012054.615 11 points of piercing damage to the shallow priest. You see another plume of dark ichor 012111.412 --> 012115.558 pouring out the side of its wound, as the bolt is now about three or four inches jutting out of the 012115.558 --> 012121.516 side of its torso. It glances sidelong at you and seems to inspire it to try and move faster. That 012121.516 --> 012122.602 finishes your turn, Nott? 012122.602 --> 012124.306 Not so much on that one, unfortunately. 012131.701 --> 012134.062 Finishing that go, Caleb, your turn. 012136.791 --> 012144.460 19 damage. All right, how do you want to do this? 012222.193 --> 012224.164 Okay. It gets some distance. Caleb, feeling comfortable, lets the missiles arc past and up and 012243.288 --> 012249.841 over as they swirl and gather. They all come in at once, and this darkened shape, suddenly there's a 012249.841 --> 012257.317 flash of arcane energy and this strange little bubble explosion where it was. The impact happens, 012257.317 --> 012303.949 and its arms separate from the impact. They hit in the torso, blew it apart from the inside. There's 012303.949 --> 012308.392 a little cloud of darkness left behind as it begins to slowly disseminate among the rest of the 012308.392 --> 012310.230 sea water around. 012310.230 --> 012312.891 Here in the shadowed darkness. 012346.713 --> 012348.908 On the two regular merrow that you came across, you find that they have their 012359.488 --> 012405.593 harpoon. There are definitely teeth upon their bodies, and claws, as part of their physical form. 012405.593 --> 012412.500 They're not carrying much on them, per se, beyond the equipment they have and a handful of collected 012412.500 --> 012424.626 shiny things. A few copper. A key that was scrounged up that's old and very rusted. Looks 012424.626 --> 012425.619 like maybe a handful of-- 012425.619 --> 012426.907 All right, you have a rusted key. 012429.165 --> 012432.668 The shallow priest, since it was destroyed a ways off, some of its accoutrements were left to 012451.644 --> 012500.043 scatter and float below. You do manage to find, on what pieces you do scrounge up, a heavy necklace 012500.043 --> 012507.471 made of these larger pearls, probably worth a little bit of gold on the side. That's about it. 012507.471 --> 012512.451 Okay. 012513.598 --> 012515.725 All right, write that down. Inspecting where the hands meet with the box, no. These are a 012522.413 --> 012523.691 different size-- 012523.691 --> 012528.470 Slightly larger. At least, it seems-- 012531.789 --> 012534.200 All right, so you have a-- 012613.330 --> 012619.074 You see these two dark octopus eyes and then this little, unshaven grin poking through underneath. 012627.619 --> 012630.977 I'd say you have a few more minutes on it still because you didn't cast any other 012647.327 --> 012650.274 concentration spells, and you didn't take any damage, so you're fine. 012650.274 --> 012655.884 You don't know. 012716.428 --> 012722.876 Okay, if you want to. 012728.292 --> 012738.845 We'll consider that as you guys are traveling. You're helming this journey from that 012745.176 --> 012747.046 direction? Make a perception check for me, please. 012747.046 --> 012752.644 22, that's great. As you guys step off of the edge of your ship's wreckage, and all slowly 012800.865 --> 012807.619 sink down to find the floor of the ocean once more and the subtle grade that continues downward. As 012807.619 --> 012812.820 you being to step, following Jester, moving forward, you see another shape begin to approach. 012812.820 --> 012816.299 Jester, you see it first and glance over. It's another ship. 012816.299 --> 012820.065 No, another ship, sunken, here. You continue on for another 100 or 150 or so feet, and you see 012826.842 --> 012830.005 the shape off to the right of another shipwreck. 012830.005 --> 012831.983 The spell fades, but you still know the general direction of where it was coming from. Up 012849.703 --> 012853.232 to you if you want to cast it again or continue on based on the memory. 012853.232 --> 012854.446 Make a perception check. 012859.309 --> 012901.963 You can certainly try. You're moving half-speed because of the water, and you're moving 012907.062 --> 012913.066 at half speed beyond that, moving stealthily. So it's a very slow journey, but you can do it. 012913.066 --> 012914.392 Okay. Are you guys moving stealthily or not? 012917.878 --> 012919.104 MARISHA and Everyone make a stealth check, and make a stealth check for Yasha as well. You guys are 012926.306 --> 012929.687 moving at quarter speed, essentially, to move underwater. 012929.687 --> 012932.827 TALIESIN and The average is slightly in your favor. You're on the edge there. Continuing forward, it 012953.650 --> 013001.394 evens out a bit, this gradual, caldera-type valley that rests here before you. The more you begin to 013001.394 --> 013007.484 watch, now that you're keeping an eye for it, there's a number of areas where wreckage can be 013007.484 --> 013012.515 seen, some of it very old. The third ship that you pass by, heading in the direction that you recall, 013012.515 --> 013015.515 has been down here for decades. 013015.515 --> 013026.346 Make a general wisdom check. 013057.952 --> 013059.135 Yeah, since she's attempting to get in tune with the energy of the atmosphere. 013105.894 --> 013114.402 You concentrate for a moment, and the water gets slightly warmer. 013121.021 --> 013124.796 You decide to maybe not walk directly behind Jester. 013131.892 --> 013133.867 With the little bit of travel you're doing-- they're sparse, but there are a number of ships in 013143.057 --> 013147.135 this large area that seem to have sunken at different times throughout the years. 013147.135 --> 013148.797 No source of light, no. Jester, however, who's been at the front keeping a close eye-- a 013153.432 --> 013159.192 little ways in as you're peering out and clocking in each of these shipwrecks as they come across, 013159.192 --> 013204.406 you see this little, faint blip of light. 013204.406 --> 013207.088 You see it once or twice again. It's a little momentary shine. 013214.624 --> 013218.360 At this point of travel, it's about 350, 400 feet ahead of you. 013232.668 --> 013235.484 The general direction. 013237.267 --> 013239.786 All right. If I could get a marching order, please. 013354.500 --> 013401.728 Who's together and what? 013406.841 --> 013408.302 What a nice book end! You all begin to slowly move forward, keeping your eyes peeled for 013437.212 --> 013444.250 any sort of movement with no light. It is extremely dark here with that faint little bit of 013444.250 --> 013446.853 shimmering dull green from above. 013446.853 --> 013453.593 There you go. As you guys continue to move in that direction, some of you begin to see this 013502.264 --> 013512.775 light as well. Caduceus first, then you, Caleb, and Beau. You see it looks like-- imagine if beams 013512.775 --> 013527.370 of sunlight managed to roll across a piece of polished metal, a little shining, shifting sight. 013527.370 --> 013529.995 Are you guys staying put or are you continuing to move forward slowly? 013633.461 --> 013636.350 You all sit tight for a second, halting your position. You watch as the octopus makes its way 013644.224 --> 013650.046 into the shadow ahead. Caleb, you're focusing, and it takes a while, but Frumpkin eventually, 013650.046 --> 013701.543 following this tiny, shifting bead of golden light into view. You begin to see towards the center of 013701.543 --> 013711.213 where this large valley is. There is a large cluster of long dead, pale-white coral that 013711.213 --> 013714.152 surrounds a rocky stone shelf. 013714.152 --> 013715.820 Make a perception check for Frumpkin. 013720.121 --> 013720.810 Okay. You see this coral space around. It's massive; it's maybe 250, 300 feet across, and it's 013733.100 --> 013740.658 this dead chunk of coral reef in this vicinity that amassed around this central stone that rises 013740.658 --> 013746.243 up. There's a small crevasse on the side of it that goes down about 30 or so feet and you can see 013746.243 --> 013748.174 fish weaving through. 013748.174 --> 013752.572 Yeah, but it's occasional. 013753.905 --> 013758.044 Yeah, and maybe every now and then reorient the direction that Frumpkin was traveling. As you 013804.945 --> 013809.141 come to see this space, does Frumpkin continue to get closer? 013809.141 --> 013811.497 Okay. Frumpkin moves around and it takes a while because Frumpkin isn't very good at 013818.460 --> 013819.716 perceiving right now. 013819.716 --> 013821.291 You guys are getting a little impatient here, hearing-- 013825.805 --> 013828.816 Yeah. 013829.747 --> 013831.756 If you want to. 013832.945 --> 013833.639 You all continue to move forward. 013841.370 --> 013842.704 Frumpkin is going around and checking and finds that towards the front of this coral reef 013856.165 --> 013902.750 area where this rock shelf is, there appears to be an open cavern entrance right underneath this 013902.750 --> 013908.750 shelf. As Frumpkin ducks down and looks, you can see another one of the shine; there's a few of them. 013908.750 --> 013910.840 Frumpkin quickly retracts and finds his way to the rest of you. 013923.389 --> 013926.159 Yep. 014118.088 --> 014123.120 As you're moving through this area, there are clumps of seaweed that rise up hundreds of 014133.527 --> 014138.493 feet out of view. The base of it is pretty thick and you could try and move through that. That's 014138.493 --> 014143.326 what you are using to stealth as you come through, darting from section to section of this heavy 014143.326 --> 014144.943 underwater vegetation. 014144.943 --> 014149.583 Sure. 014151.844 --> 014153.113 That's going to itch like a motherfucker in the morning. 014159.711 --> 014204.543 You slowly farm sections of seaweed and begin to shift your way forward, using it as a 014209.844 --> 014218.362 screen. The shifting tendrils slowly shimmy along in the direction of this coral cluster. 014218.362 --> 014219.793 There you go. 014221.204 --> 014225.373 Who's at the front of this journey? Maintaining a similar position? 014238.577 --> 014239.808 Okay. Perception check, and one other person if they wish to. 014242.413 --> 014243.618 Both of you guys roll perception. 014253.023 --> 014254.443 LAURA and Okay. 014255.382 --> 014256.463 As you both come up to the edge of where the sandbank here seems to slightly descend in a 014302.660 --> 014308.787 series of soft steps before that small ravine carves down and that large chunk of rock stands 014308.787 --> 014314.649 there, you can see the cavern. You see once again that shifting. It's like a wave of light passes 014314.649 --> 014321.913 over. You can see it's coins. A bunch of light passes over coins that are scattered amongst the 014321.913 --> 014324.065 floor of the entrance of this tunnel. 014324.065 --> 014326.471 Not from this distance. 014330.428 --> 014331.329 You saw at the entrance a handful of coins that caught the light, yeah. 014341.159 --> 014342.679 You're maybe about, since you stopped at that edge before it begins to descend over, you're 014547.533 --> 014549.356 about 60 or so feet from this. 014549.356 --> 014555.163 Yeah. Ahead and facing towards you guys with a large shelf that protrudes over it that puts it 014559.576 --> 014604.982 mostly in shadow, and the coral's built all around that. If you wanted to try and move around it you 014604.982 --> 014608.252 could, but it's about 200 or so feet across. 014608.252 --> 014613.860 You guys swim across towards the top? All right. You paddle up as a group, up-- 014630.846 --> 014632.434 TRAVIS and Oh, around? 014633.462 --> 014634.559 You guys move slowly around, still moving stealthily, to the edges. Then you move up and 014639.984 --> 014641.651 over? What are you doing? 014641.651 --> 014642.205 Okay. 014643.305 --> 014645.027 You get up and slowly descend towards where the coral is. Your feet find the edges. Some of it 014650.242 --> 014655.354 is brittle and as your foot touches, it snaps and parts of it crumble at the very edges, but nothing 014655.354 --> 014700.210 that you feel will alert your presence necessarily. 014700.210 --> 014702.617 As you move up to the edge of the shelf, and you glance over the edge, you see the shadow 014712.830 --> 014723.247 entrance of the cavern before you. Once again that shimmer finds its way across a dozen or more coins 014723.247 --> 014730.684 that are visible, partially embedded in the muck and sand there at the foot of this cavern entrance. 014730.726 --> 014734.300 It's bits of coral. When you step out towards that shelf, the coral recedes and now it's 014746.883 --> 014750.866 a protruding large slab of stone. 014750.866 --> 014755.561 Make a perception check. 014757.699 --> 014758.989 It looks to be stone. 014818.369 --> 014826.755 Okay. So you use Channel Divinity once and you send your duplicate to swim down-- 014837.493 --> 014841.823 Okay. You watch as the illusory Jester goes and performs a great stock video of excited lucky 014857.650 --> 014901.943 person, performing the reaction silently. 014901.943 --> 014905.507 Have you ever--? 014906.978 --> 014907.810 Don't you hate it when--? 014911.154 --> 014915.368 30 seconds pass of Jester doing the song and dance down there. No reaction. 014921.449 --> 014924.779 Okay. Fjord dives off the side and swims down towards the entrance to this cavern. As you 014932.998 --> 014937.523 approach you can see the coins plainly in front of you. Do you land at the entrance? 014937.523 --> 014938.441 Okay. Your feet find soft footfall on the sediment that has gathered there, knocking up a 014945.558 --> 014948.960 little bit of it for a minute before it all eventually settles once more. Looking inside, make 014948.960 --> 014950.661 a perception check. 014950.661 --> 014953.547 Okay. 014954.410 --> 014956.917 You glance inside; there's no source of the light that you keep seeing flashing by. You look 015004.568 --> 015010.196 down and there's no glittering anymore. There's no traveling light beam, but the coins are there in 015010.196 --> 015015.195 front of you. Looking up into the cavern, it continues in and seems to descend and open up into 015015.195 --> 015019.342 a chamber just where your darkvision ends. 015019.342 --> 015020.402 The inside is filled with seaweed as well. It seems to be running up the walls of the 015028.394 --> 015034.455 interior, as well as a section of it sitting in the center of the main chamber. It's a different 015034.455 --> 015037.005 color than the seaweed that you've been using to get here. 015037.005 --> 015041.551 With a slight displacement and popping sound of the water making room for the falchion as it 015119.979 --> 015125.456 emerges, it hums slightly in your grasp, being this deep in the ocean. 015125.456 --> 015130.260 No, but it is casting it and it is very present. There is a faint hint of eagerness 015139.081 --> 015140.703 brimming from within you. 015140.703 --> 015145.269 Okay, so you stay up above. All of you make your way towards the entrance to this cavern. 015157.460 --> 015201.324 All right, that will be Caleb at the back, Jester and Fjord towards the front, everyone else 015213.598 --> 015214.921 staying in the center. 015214.921 --> 015218.313 That's right, so you will be up with Jester. As you guys slowly begin to make your way into the tunnel-- 015229.779 --> 015234.271 As you release Nott into the water, you guys begin to take your first steps into the interior 015242.234 --> 015244.947 of the cavern. We're going to take a break. 015244.947 --> 015247.917 We'll be back here in a minute to see what this strange chamber seems to hold. 015256.407 --> 015303.667 Yes, once you stood there, the gold was seemingly inert. 015310.106 --> 015311.905 We'll be back here in a few minutes. Before we hop over, we do have the giveaway. Our fine 015322.403 --> 015327.744 friends at Wyrmwood are giving away this amazing wenge dice vault. "Wenj"? How do you pronounce it? 015328.659 --> 015330.090 "When-gay," thank you. I always mess that up, I don't know. 015332.077 --> 015333.920 This is awesome, two-tone on each side, dice vault for giveaway. It is the wenge dice vault 015340.289 --> 015345.873 with tiger maple inlay, which is what this is called-- looks awesome-- and a copy of your own 015345.873 --> 015348.160 Pumat t-shirt is in the giveaway as well! 015348.160 --> 015349.879 I hope not, you don't want that. You really don't want that. This will be given away to 015353.061 --> 015356.902 somebody at the end of the break. To enter, go ahead and head over to the Critical Role Twitch 015356.902 --> 015404.060 chat at twitch.tv/criticalrole during the break and enter the word intro. I-N-T-R-O. Enter it 015404.060 --> 015408.121 once; more than that, you'll be disqualified, unfortunately, and once again this is only viable 015408.121 --> 015410.297 for people in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Quebec. 015410.297 --> 015411.562 I know. We'll have a winner here in a few minutes, so sit tight, we'll see you soon. 015418.934 --> 021316.206 [break] 021316.206 --> 021322.469 QuickAscen-- no. 021335.416 --> 021337.595 That will break me. As we left off, you all were beginning to make your way into this series 021352.370 --> 021356.808 of-- there's this whole strange entrance to this cavern. 021356.808 --> 021359.030 As you step in the inside, it descends a bit, like makeshift natural paths, like stairs or 021412.558 --> 021418.294 grades that curve around and drop into the central chamber where you see it goes in two different 021418.294 --> 021426.287 directions, to the right and left. In the middle, there's a large cluster of this purplish-maroon 021426.287 --> 021433.550 seaweed. The outside of the leaves have a teal-ish blue color. It wraps up against the walls 021433.550 --> 021440.371 as well. As you swim through and move, the still water shifts with your movement; you can see some 021440.371 --> 021442.687 of it sway and move with your movement. 021442.687 --> 021447.213 Looking down, make an investigation check. 021451.580 --> 021453.693 Apparently. Well, if there was a week to use it. 021503.794 --> 021504.803 You sift your hand through underneath and feel. You find an errant copper piece left there 021510.861 --> 021519.102 that comes up into your fingers. The rest of it appears to be general sand and soft silt that 021519.102 --> 021524.385 clouds a bit around your fingers as you pull your hand up from mucking around in it. It settles 021524.385 --> 021525.538 fairly quickly. 021525.538 --> 021529.777 Right about now, she vanishes. 021535.777 --> 021536.603 Yes. 021540.145 --> 021547.755 It's certainly possible. 021552.524 --> 021558.413 Okay. Nothing ahead of you seems to give a magical aura; behind you, ever so faintly. 021622.799 --> 021627.245 It's coming from the mouth of the cave, towards the top. 021629.913 --> 021632.714 Nothing in the room-- and you do know, glancing at that magical aura coming from the 021646.594 --> 021650.858 entranceway, it is illusory in nature. 021650.858 --> 021659.326 Correct. 021700.260 --> 021703.539 Nope. 021704.666 --> 021708.162 Old Buttonbeard's legend lives on! As Buttonbeard trounces around the central chamber, 021753.030 --> 021756.497 no reaction. 021756.497 --> 021808.079 You express your interests to the kelp. Well, seaweed, technically. Kelp is a little more 021818.626 --> 021820.119 shallow-based, yeah. 021820.119 --> 021822.125 You're all still standing in the entranceway as you come down into this central chamber. It's 021844.254 --> 021848.634 about 35, 40 feet from side to side and then it branches off to the right and left ahead of you-- 021848.634 --> 021850.830 There is that central cluster of seaweed that is coming up and going against the ceiling 021854.084 --> 021857.451 and you can see on the walls, it's still riding along the edges. 021857.451 --> 021859.741 You move towards the fork. The chamber itself is oval-like, but in the center of the 021928.962 --> 021934.817 chamber is where there's a mass of the seaweed, so you'd have to curve around it to get to either exit. 021934.849 --> 021939.077 There are some wayward stones that you could probably-- 021943.325 --> 021946.729 No, all the seaweed in this chamber is a different color than what you've seen when you 021950.053 --> 021955.291 came in. Everything else had a greenish-blue tint to it, this has a deep maroon-purple with a blue 021955.291 --> 021959.856 outline across the exterior of each little thread of leaf. 021959.856 --> 022005.167 Yeah, they were mango-esque. 022011.526 --> 022013.060 It hits it, moves with the impact with the faint bit that gets hit. There's no reaction. 022032.494 --> 022037.714 Make a perception check. 022124.479 --> 022135.316 Oh, just you, okay. 022138.097 --> 022143.947 No bubbles. There's no aeration of the interior here. 022148.090 --> 022151.328 Glancing up, yeah, you can see where the seaweed gathers and bunches up towards meeting it 022155.770 --> 022202.097 from the walls in the center of the chamber. It's maybe 15 feet above you. It's not terribly tall. 022202.097 --> 022204.752 You can see the two sides, yeah. 022216.210 --> 022222.538 It looks like it's a cavern. 022228.438 --> 022231.944 Okay. It goes a few inches into the soft floor of the chamber before it hits stone. 022256.254 --> 022259.402 Okay. You take your first step and you watch something drift across the entrance from wall to 022312.328 --> 022318.170 wall. Some faint glowing figure-- and is gone. 022318.170 --> 022320.124 Not magic sense, no. 022328.813 --> 022332.760 Okay. Give me the specifications on that one. 022341.502 --> 022348.334 Okay, got you. How long does it last? 022357.385 --> 022400.658 Okay. We'll say for the purposes of this, this is a reaction to seeing this figure pass by. 022409.557 --> 022416.929 You definitely get an undead sense from whatever this figure is, and then it merges with the wall 022416.929 --> 022422.099 and is gone. It appeared to be loosely humanoid in the brief glimpse you saw. 022422.099 --> 022424.236 Okay. In the center of the kelp forest that sits in the center of the chamber, a source of 022505.474 --> 022512.565 light begins to emanate, like a lantern covered in soft, diffusing material. The beams protrude and 022512.565 --> 022519.065 lighten up the chamber like a lantern. As it goes through, you have a better view of the interior. 022519.065 --> 022531.469 You notice that the kelp forest is cluttered with strips of cloth, bones, two or three merrow 022531.469 --> 022538.608 corpses that have long decomposed and look tangled and wrapped and are held towards the ceiling. 022538.608 --> 022547.496 There are a handful of what might have been human remains tangled in that same seaweed. 022547.496 --> 022550.547 The light vanishes once more and darkness comes to the chamber. 022638.098 --> 022642.065 Do you guys continue to the right chamber? 022644.228 --> 022644.776 Understood. Fjord? You just have this gentle chill on the back of your head, like something 022706.544 --> 022711.501 frozen just caressed the back of your skull and is gone. 022711.501 --> 022714.257 You continue forward through this tunnel around the seaweed cluster in the center. Moving 022749.485 --> 022755.793 through in the same order that you situated there. There's just enough room, maybe ten feet across, 022755.793 --> 022804.058 to stay comfortably, you'd want to single-file it. As you walk through, the edges of the seaweed 022804.058 --> 022809.136 begin to drift forward, seemingly drawn in by the warmth of your bodies. 022809.136 --> 022810.290 It's pulling in. There's the central section and the wall. As you begin to move through, it 022820.328 --> 022823.407 begins to slowly pull in to close in towards you. 022823.407 --> 022827.352 Moving quickly through, it's not moving rapidly. As soon as you see this, you begin to 022835.658 --> 022839.220 dart through. The only person who would be in danger is the very end. Caleb, since you're at the 022839.220 --> 022843.189 back, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw for me. Because as all of you start darting 022843.189 --> 022847.602 through and making your way, they're drifting and tangling in closer together. 022847.602 --> 022852.129 Okay. As you move forward, you feel a bit of it touch your shoulder, and then it wraps around 022900.804 --> 022906.133 and pulls you against the wall. You guys hear this (slamming) behind. There's a shift of water. You 022906.133 --> 022911.669 watch Caleb get yanked towards the right side of the chamber. It's currently (sucking). The seaweed 022911.669 --> 022919.650 begins to snake its way around. Caleb, you take five points of poison damage and are grappled. 022919.650 --> 022921.143 Sure, I'll say two attacks with disadvantage because you're having to aim them to try to keep 022931.619 --> 022932.374 around him. 022932.374 --> 022934.121 Okay, the light fills the space. 022936.903 --> 022941.056 Okay, yeah. Both hit, go ahead and roll damage. 022943.356 --> 022945.403 Okay, each side-- Both blasts of Eldritch Blast impact the sides of the cavern wall with a 022958.057 --> 023005.210 dull (thud). The clusters of seaweed that currently wrap around Caleb are torn to the point 023005.210 --> 023009.481 where you have enough strength to pull yourself free, breaking the grapple. You shrug them off of 023009.481 --> 023014.247 you. As you're touching with your fingers, your fingers spike with pain. No additional poison 023014.247 --> 023017.419 damage, necessarily, but you know staying would continue to do so. 023017.419 --> 023018.678 You are not poisoned. You just took poison damage. You manage to pull it away and catch up 023022.445 --> 023026.468 with the rest of the crew. You guys are heading towards the right chamber, which begins to rise up 023026.468 --> 023032.109 a bit before leveling off about 15 feet above and about 20 feet ahead of you. The walls are still 023032.109 --> 023038.098 covered in this seaweed in chunks. About every five or so feet, you see another cluster, and 023038.098 --> 023044.916 they're a bit scattered around the interior. A large portion of this whole chamber network seems 023044.916 --> 023048.206 to be housing this same type of plant. 023048.206 --> 023053.006 Make a perception check. 023057.197 --> 023058.833 Okay, so you're readying the spell? 023106.538 --> 023108.220 Yeah, so you're fine. 023109.782 --> 023111.143 Okay. Jester, you feel this-- like a burst of brain freeze for a second-- like something cold 023130.983 --> 023133.838 tickles the inside of your head. And it's gone. 023133.838 --> 023136.764 Caduceus, you see something shadowy shift long down the hall up and above that barely catches 023152.456 --> 023154.371 your attention before it's gone. 023154.371 --> 023157.513 You don't. It's not the same as before. 023200.401 --> 023202.374 From what you saw before, it was giving a faint, pale glow and had a ghostly presence to it. 023208.378 --> 023210.707 This is just a movement in dark shadow. 023210.707 --> 023218.887 Yeah, she has an ability. 023241.317 --> 023242.897 Yeah, so Yasha holds onto that, then. 023310.867 --> 023311.970 All right. So continuing on? 023319.847 --> 023323.693 All right. Go ahead and make a perception check to see if you notice anything strange about 023330.988 --> 023332.591 the interior. 023332.591 --> 023335.418 Okay. Looking about the area, it looks like a natural cavern. You don't see much that would 023342.619 --> 023348.327 catch-- any some sort of dissembled or trap mechanism with a trigger. 023348.327 --> 023350.260 Okay. The globules appear like lights coming on segmented down a long hallway. As the final one 023416.700 --> 023424.368 glows, right behind it, you see the figure of a man looking at you, white and pale, who then steps 023424.368 --> 023426.304 back into the wall and vanishes. 023426.304 --> 023429.044 No. Because you're the closest up there, since you're helming it in with darkvision-- 023530.288 --> 023536.477 Darkvision wouldn't matter so much in this instance. But the figure you saw looked to be male 023536.477 --> 023548.362 wearing loose fitting clothing, sunken eyes with no actual eyes inside the sockets, pale with a 023548.362 --> 023559.175 faint ghostly glow about their visage. A line of rope wrapped around one arm. Multiple loops. It 023559.175 --> 023601.715 just stared at you before stepping back into the wall and vanishing. 023601.715 --> 023603.395 No expression. Just blank and cold. Absent of any real emotion before it dissipated. 023635.293 --> 023637.324 Continuing down this path, you climb or swim up the brief 15-foot incline to get to the next 023645.761 --> 023652.693 tunnel path where the orbs were spread out to continue. You move through and the elements of 023652.693 --> 023658.120 seaweed that were still in there are shifting from the water displacement ever so slightly. As you 023658.120 --> 023701.453 move through, same order you guys are going through? 023701.453 --> 023702.545 All right. That being the case, as you push through I need Caleb once again to make a 023708.766 --> 023709.924 dexterity saving throw. 023709.924 --> 023712.859 Okay. Go for it. I'll let you do that. 023715.912 --> 023716.554 All right. You cast Expeditious Retreat. You manage to dart forward and out of the grasping 023721.701 --> 023729.249 hands of the seaweed through the use of your spell. You catch up, now darting forward through 023729.249 --> 023731.962 everybody next to Jester and Fjord. 023731.962 --> 023734.393 Okay. There. We are moving forward in that. 023744.122 --> 023750.944 Okay. Following the tunnel down for another 15 to 20 or so feet it curves around to the left. 023804.593 --> 023808.400 Do you continue and curve around the edge? 023808.400 --> 023810.133 You come around the corner and look. You guys are at the front. I need Jester and Fjord to 023815.346 --> 023819.505 make-- since you have the globes, you can move the globes ahead if you want to. 023819.505 --> 023825.637 So you do not have disadvantage on your perception checks. 023828.388 --> 023829.322 Well, you're further back. We'll get to you. Because they're the ones at the front, they get to 023837.747 --> 023838.861 do this first. 023838.861 --> 023840.095 But you're safer in the middle. What did you get? 023843.985 --> 023844.798 As you turn around the corner and look, the path continues for another 20 or so feet in this 023850.362 --> 023857.124 tunnel before it descends into a much larger chamber. The seaweed gets thicker towards the 023857.124 --> 023907.829 mouth of this chamber. From the little bit of glowing orbs that begin to extend over that edge 023907.829 --> 023915.556 that goes into it, what little bit of light hits bits of gold coins scattered all throughout the 023915.556 --> 023917.230 floor of that next chamber. 023917.230 --> 023918.635 Yes, they are, but that center cluster seemed to have quite a few that were in there. 023931.291 --> 023940.151 These in the walls only have a few scattered pieces of parts. No full bodies here in the hallway. 023940.151 --> 023941.892 Beau, as you're coming around that corner and people are looking off to the side, you glance 023950.807 --> 023959.661 over your shoulder and see for a split second an older man with a curled and scraggly beard that 023959.661 --> 024005.533 goes down to about mid-chest. The eyes are missing. You see vacant, dark sockets. The jaw is 024005.533 --> 024010.938 slack-jawed and open as it looks towards you. I need you to make a charisma saving throw, please. 024010.938 --> 024021.260 It leans in towards you and-- not yet. It leans in towards you and you feel this cold 024030.820 --> 024037.132 sensation over your whole body. Your muscles lock in place and your consciousness goes dark. Out of 024037.132 --> 024043.085 the corner of your eye you see some sort of ghostly movement. You look over and see Beau rest 024043.085 --> 024045.400 into a standing position on her back foot. 024045.400 --> 024052.254 What's the DC on that? 024056.222 --> 024101.572 Eyes are open, yeah. 024107.103 --> 024116.174 Whatever your spell DC is. 024124.709 --> 024126.696 16. No, fails by one. It's a 14 plus one, 15. 024133.739 --> 024135.375 Being a specialist in undead and already preparing for the presence here, you glance out of 024142.037 --> 024148.429 the corner of your eye just in time to see the essence of this spiritual form drift into Beau's 024148.429 --> 024157.124 body. As you watch that moment of consciousness fade from her face, as the presence of Beau goes 024157.124 --> 024203.503 cold and whatever was in this tunnel begins to come to the forefront, you take your staff and 024203.503 --> 024211.256 slam it into the ground. This wave of light energy emerges. It impacts all of you and the water gets 024211.256 --> 024216.069 suddenly warm around you. As it blows past Beau, you see strands of hair get blown back and with 024216.069 --> 024224.284 that, that same ghostly old man body jettisons out the back of her and drags down the hallway into 024224.284 --> 024226.093 darkness and disappears. 024226.093 --> 024227.901 You have an essence after what just happened that something weird happened and you lost yourself. 024312.628 --> 024317.073 As you guys are having this conversation, you glance back in the tunnel where you came from 024350.641 --> 024357.181 where Caduceus had jettisoned that spirit back, and at the very edge of the light, you can see 024357.181 --> 024403.509 about 12 or so of these ghostly figures standing there, unmoving-- 024403.509 --> 024409.597 All right. Pushing towards and following the orbs gliding forward, the mouth of this 024425.301 --> 024429.765 entranceway before it opens up is where it looks like two larger clusters on each side of this 024429.765 --> 024431.982 seaweed is through. You are what? 024431.982 --> 024436.030 They auto-fail saving throws. They're seaweed. 024441.500 --> 024446.929 (laughter) 024446.929 --> 024450.514 Roll damage. We'll see if it's enough to clear the way for a moment. You as well, Caduceus. 024500.253 --> 024501.761 Okay. The side on Caduceus' edge of the wall, you watch this blast of radiant energy 024519.942 --> 024525.842 emanate from the side of the wall and blow out the center part. Some of the seaweed get released and 024525.842 --> 024530.155 begins to scatter and float towards the top. Your side blasts, but it doesn't quite tear all the way 024530.155 --> 024537.994 through. You guys begin darting forward on the right side. Caleb, you're the first one there. 024537.994 --> 024539.993 No. You're still Expeditious Retreat? 024541.574 --> 024543.803 All right. You dart inside the chamber ahead of everybody else. You're now in the center of 024548.856 --> 024553.264 this open chamber as you stop with the globes around you to take in the atmosphere. The rest of 024553.264 --> 024559.013 you are now having to catch up. Yasha needs to make a dexterity saving throw as well. 024559.013 --> 024559.790 She gets advantage because she can see it, because of her Danger Sense. 024603.043 --> 024605.015 She just-- actually no, she shoulder checks the seaweed and does not give a shit. 024611.619 --> 024613.646 You guys all begin to push forward. This chamber is larger than what you came in through. 024623.180 --> 024631.395 It's about 50 to 60-foot diameter, continues in for about 80 or so feet, and the height goes to 024631.395 --> 024641.249 about 30 to 35 feet. All the walls here are covered in this seaweed. Make a perception check, 024641.249 --> 024644.219 two of you who are helming the view on this. 024644.219 --> 024645.748 That's true. Yeah, you make one first. 024647.472 --> 024651.259 Okay. Glancing around, you can see areas where the seaweed is slowly shifting from the 024656.919 --> 024701.794 movement of Caleb's Expeditious Retreat. What was once still shifts, and you can see elements of the 024701.794 --> 024713.384 stone wall behind it. Your eyes barely make out a handful of small carvings in the wall. Small runic 024713.384 --> 024721.158 letters that are not in line, but at angle sporadically carved at places, but where the 024721.158 --> 024722.848 seaweed moves over and blocks it. 024722.848 --> 024727.802 Yeah, I'd say you're pushing the edge on this one. 024733.591 --> 024735.741 I'd say as you step into this chamber-- are you heading to the center of it? 024743.101 --> 024745.840 As you're standing at the mouth of this, just past the edge, you do not detect anything 024749.877 --> 024754.809 particularly magical. Then as you take your first step into the chamber, you see this. You almost 024754.809 --> 024804.190 run into it. In the middle of this chamber, there is a small two-foot pedestal and a disc, a stone 024804.190 --> 024811.735 disc about that wide and about two feet from edge to edge that is resting on it but at an angle. It 024811.735 --> 024822.052 looks old. It looks weathered and there appears to be a spiral of runes, two sets of them, that curve 024822.052 --> 024827.487 inward around each other before merging in the center with one singular sigil where they meet. 024827.487 --> 024834.107 They are arcane glyphs. If you'd like to make an arcana check, if you want to take a moment 024837.396 --> 024838.054 to study. 024838.054 --> 024847.166 These runes, this whole incantation, this enchantment or whatever that sits in this is old, 024917.136 --> 024925.229 pre-Calamity, Age of Arcana-level magic. It is dormant currently. It looks like there is 024925.229 --> 024936.593 something that is required to infuse this object with power or to get it to use whatever its 024936.593 --> 024947.573 enchantment is. The more you look over it, you realize the power's beyond anything you've cast. 024947.573 --> 024959.984 The nature of it seems to be conjuration, and it seems to have a lot of the base runes that you've 024959.984 --> 025012.995 used to manipulate fire, you've used to manipulate earth. It's elemental in nature. You continue to 025012.995 --> 025020.657 look over it and get the sense that this is triggered by some sort of-- there's a physical 025020.657 --> 025027.192 material that needs to be brought to this table or brought as part of this ritual, and in doing so 025027.192 --> 025030.789 would conjure some sort of powerful elemental force. 025030.789 --> 025039.307 No, you did not. 025040.618 --> 025041.711 You do feel this faint, cold, brushing sensation at the back of your skull. 025046.973 --> 025049.242 Okay. You cast Locate Object, focusing on? 025105.420 --> 025107.235 You step forward and can see in the far, back side of the chamber. As you guys get a look 025111.465 --> 025118.224 around, clustered in with the base of the walls where the seaweed is thick, you begin to see as 025118.224 --> 025125.338 the light around the chamber comes to touch it, and you see it first, there are piles of salvaged 025125.338 --> 025135.364 goods gold and silver dishware. Clusters of coins gold, platinum, copper, silver, all in 025135.364 --> 025142.017 various levels of grime that have gathered on them, but the shine still shows through in places. 025142.017 --> 025151.615 You can see tools that were haphazardly pulled and gathered and jammed into pockets in the walls. 025151.615 --> 025200.751 It's like a nightmarish Ariel's grotto, almost. You immediately realize that this is all things 025200.751 --> 025206.722 that have been salvaged and pulled from all the ships that have sunk and brought in. The floor 025206.722 --> 025211.752 you've been stepping on, that's been somewhat soft to the occasional crunch, you glance down and 025211.752 --> 025227.360 realize, is just bones. Just hundreds of human and humanoid bones that have all been gently dusted 025227.360 --> 025230.871 with the general sand and silt of the interior of this chamber. 025230.871 --> 025235.117 There is a throne, a chair of some kind that sits on the opposite side of the room. That's at a 025242.637 --> 025249.034 slight angle, resting against the stone, and you immediately know that's precisely where the object 025249.034 --> 025252.173 you seek resides, somewhere around or with that. 025252.173 --> 025254.190 You guys are standing towards the entrance, like the stairs and the decline that leads inside. 025306.981 --> 025315.219 Caleb's the only one that's actually in the center of the chamber by this table, this thing that 025315.219 --> 025316.886 you've been studying. 025316.886 --> 025319.671 You glance over your shoulder? 025321.377 --> 025321.974 About 15 feet behind you. 025323.022 --> 025325.334 (yelling and groaning) 025325.334 --> 025327.312 As you're getting closer, because the arcana is not an immediate thing, it's a slow process of 025350.378 --> 025358.565 study. There's a heavy elemental conjuring that this is capable of doing. It's very old, primal 025358.565 --> 025408.413 magic. Looking at the stone, the stains, and the interior of these ruins, there is distinctly a 025408.413 --> 025414.576 dark brown tint to elements of this table. 025414.576 --> 025418.441 As you scrape some of it with your fingernail, it flakes off. It has a consistency 025430.470 --> 025435.891 you're familiar with, that of a coagulated blood. 025435.891 --> 025437.661 Caduceus, as you're looking over towards the throne, you look up and about ten feet above the 025451.253 --> 025459.495 throne, standing up in the seaweed holding onto the clusters of it, you see a female humanoid form 025459.495 --> 025507.316 mostly in shadow, hair down over the front of the face, one yellow eye peeking through on this side, 025507.316 --> 025512.889 and one half-open yellow eye glancing through, up against the wall. 025512.889 --> 025515.418 You watch as she scrambles across the side of the wall, behind the seaweed, and is gone. 025530.200 --> 025531.080 Let's roll initiative. 025535.442 --> 025537.648 (yelling) 025537.648 --> 025539.510 This is the chamber you're in right now. This is the entrance. 025615.059 --> 025616.952 Yeah, you did. 025618.797 --> 025621.141 So, Caleb, you are up against here. The rest of you are just coming down the entrance this way. 025631.856 --> 025634.478 Tell me whereabouts you were placed around the base. 025634.478 --> 025636.252 That's true. I'll put you and Caduceus kind of up towards the top, there. You guys are back here. 025653.205 --> 025655.885 Yeah, so you'll be up here with the rest of them. The shape you saw up in this direction 025701.358 --> 025703.344 before it vanished. 025703.344 --> 025705.944 Dashilla rolled really good initiative. So, who's up first? 25 to 20. 025724.253 --> 025725.008 All right. 20 to 15. 025742.604 --> 025744.714 Fjord at a 16. 15 to ten. 025749.006 --> 025750.138 Nott. Ten to five. 025755.063 --> 025757.585 Caleb? 025800.994 --> 025801.821 All righty. 025803.698 --> 025808.158 No, I'd say it took you two or three minutes to study, so Expeditious is still on the table. 025813.029 --> 025817.282 Beginning of this round. The only person that's seen this entity is Caduceus. 025822.733 --> 025825.103 No. They seem to have shifted into this thick forest of seaweed that tends to wrap around 025832.706 --> 025841.502 all the walls of this chamber. Beau, you're up first. 025841.502 --> 025846.211 You can use your action to try and perceive if you want to. 025849.897 --> 025854.473 Okay, so you use the search action. Roll a perception check. 025857.549 --> 025901.176 Eight? Unfortunately, no. You look around the vicinity and glancing up around, and you see 025905.766 --> 025910.833 movement from the water that's being disturbed, but no sight of any particular entity. 025910.833 --> 025918.703 Okay. Bonus action to Patient Defense. 025926.574 --> 025927.695 Okay. That finishes Beau's turn. Caduceus and Jester, you guys can decide which of you goes first. 025934.647 --> 025937.047 Is Bless concentration? 025944.896 --> 025951.313 All right, so you guys get to add a d4 to your attack rolls and saving throws. 025955.260 --> 025959.086 Right here? 030015.707 --> 030018.562 Okay, so you go against the wall? 030020.435 --> 030021.992 There's seaweed there. 030022.878 --> 030024.368 All the walls are coated in this. 030025.939 --> 030031.083 Down this way? 030032.116 --> 030034.046 Okay, I'll put you there. 030035.343 --> 030037.241 Okay. That finishes your turn, Caduceus. That finishes your turn, Jester. Okay, Jester, 030041.196 --> 030042.873 you're casting Spiritual Guardians? 030042.873 --> 030045.566 There alongside him. 030047.508 --> 030051.079 Well, where do you want to go? If you want to move-- 030052.540 --> 030055.872 Here? Yeah, we'll make it work. There, sure. 030101.577 --> 030108.782 Now all these little glowing pink seahorses now surround you. 15-foot, right? 030120.145 --> 030122.041 Got it, okay. You have that up. You are also now concentrating on Spiritual Guardians. That 030129.679 --> 030131.703 finishes Jester's turn there. 030131.703 --> 030133.162 That brings us to-- what did you guys both roll initiative on? 030136.709 --> 030137.963 LAURA and Okay, so concurrent with your turn, lair action. 030141.430 --> 030143.314 At this point-- 030147.043 --> 030149.584 You're in the lair of Dashilla. For this lair action, it's going to use Lament of the Dead. 030155.696 --> 030204.986 As you all stand here, rising out of the ground, dozens of spirits begin to drift up, of various 030204.986 --> 030212.912 drowned sailors and scavengers, out of the ground and up toward the ceiling. I need everybody inside 030212.912 --> 030215.024 to make a wisdom saving throw, please. 030215.024 --> 030218.023 Fjord, you're fine. Yasha is frightened of Dashilla until the end of the round. Caleb? 030252.157 --> 030253.211 You succeed. You manage to resist the fear effect. 030301.235 --> 030302.757 Oh, Nott. 030304.779 --> 030306.977 That's right, because you're drunk! 030309.253 --> 030313.789 (yelling) 030313.789 --> 030315.389 Nott becomes Nott the Brave when she's drunk. 030323.521 --> 030325.238 So unaffected. Spirits, whatever! 030328.605 --> 030330.094 You've been braving the ocean for half a day. 030332.237 --> 030334.901 You manage to resist it. 030337.478 --> 030342.129 As the spirits rise, this haunting, wailing sound reverberates in the chamber. Both Caleb and 030352.065 --> 030359.068 Yasha, their eyes go wide, and their breathing begins to increase. You guys are frightened of 030359.068 --> 030402.519 Dashilla to the end of the turn. Now it comes to Dashilla's turn. 030402.519 --> 030403.957 Suddenly, tearing through the seaweed on the upper wall, you see this figure emerge now. This 030411.307 --> 030422.961 pale, aqua-green skin that's bulbous and strangely proportioned. These long, clawed hands. As the 030422.961 --> 030430.383 hair pulls back, you can see, where would be a humanoid face instead are these protracted, almost 030430.383 --> 030439.191 anglerfish-type teeth that come out of the front, with no nose, and the yellow eyes gleaming from 030439.191 --> 030442.288 underneath. She's going to look straight down at you, Caleb. 030442.288 --> 030443.560 I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for me, please. 030446.299 --> 030447.674 Natural one? As she looks, she's still up in the air, swimming, looking at you. Mouth opens, 030501.953 --> 030510.314 and you feel the deepest, most horrifying fear well up inside you. Your heart stops, and you drop 030510.314 --> 030511.509 to zero hit points. 030511.509 --> 030513.842 You guys watch Caleb go (creaking) and start drifting there, unconscious. 030519.663 --> 030521.813 Dashilla, now hovering in the space, is going to move over. She moves over to the side of 030533.134 --> 030540.593 the wall here, still visible, now jumping and using and holding onto the seaweed like it's a 030540.593 --> 030546.002 tether. All right. 030546.002 --> 030547.757 The periapt. That ends her turn. Fjord, you're up. 030553.273 --> 030555.844 She's visible. She's up on the wall on this side. 030558.529 --> 030600.763 Remember, you guys are still underwater. Aside from Fjord, you're all half speed. 030604.430 --> 030607.673 Yeah. 030612.666 --> 030615.048 The sword does give a faint bit of light. 030616.991 --> 030618.471 Right there? 030629.261 --> 030642.597 She is hexed. You have already used your-- 030645.814 --> 030648.247 As she's holding up there, looking down at you, the murkiness of the nearby waters in the 030656.239 --> 030700.935 movement begins to form around her and almost try and claw at her throat, like the shadows 030700.935 --> 030703.885 themselves are trying to pull at her clavicle. 030703.885 --> 030709.818 Roll two attacks. 030710.739 --> 030712.326 Yeah, it is! 030718.434 --> 030722.229 Both hit. You don't even need the d4s on that. Roll damage on the critical first. 030727.209 --> 030734.245 So two, but roll the d6, which is also doubled. 030737.890 --> 030739.702 So 12, so that's 14 plus your-- 030741.871 --> 030743.323 That's 18 points of damage on that one. And damage for the second one? 030749.025 --> 030757.673 Well, look at that. 36 points of damage on a cantrip and a Hex. That's how warlocks are done. 030805.048 --> 030813.328 So as she's up there, as the Hex constrains around her, both Eldritch Blasts hit. From both blasts, 030813.328 --> 030818.447 there's these dark scar marks on the upper torso and one off the shoulder where they impact. The 030818.447 --> 030824.566 head curls up and (creaking) back in your direction. The eyes seem to bulge angrily toward you. 030824.566 --> 030825.743 Does that end your turn? 030827.132 --> 030830.156 Okay. At the end of your turn, she's going to use one of her legendary actions to use Forced 030839.142 --> 030846.099 Vision. At some point during this adventure, as she was trailing you throughout the cavern and 030846.318 --> 030850.649 watching from a distance, she ensorceled a number of your members of the party, you being one of them. 030850.649 --> 030851.793 She was hiding through all the seaweed, and no one was rolling high enough perception to see 030901.053 --> 030905.081 her. You saw her move once because she didn't roll high enough stealth on that one. 030905.081 --> 030907.287 Correct. You are not immediately in melee with anybody, but she's going to force you to 030914.554 --> 030919.473 move. You glance. All of a sudden you see her out of the corner of your eye. She's not there 030919.473 --> 030924.568 anymore. She's off there. You rush in her direction after her, compelled to move over this 030924.568 --> 030928.626 side right up against the wall, between the wall and Beau. You get there, and she's gone. You look 030928.626 --> 030933.559 back, and she never left. You shake your head for a second. That's one legendary action done. Next 030933.559 --> 030935.325 turn is Nott. 030935.325 --> 030943.811 Okay. You move over there. So bonus action, hide. 030947.451 --> 030951.594 16 hits. 030952.760 --> 030955.412 Sorry, that's right. Yeah. 030957.060 --> 030959.769 You don't know. You'll find out. 031001.256 --> 031003.015 All right. So you dart from behind and fire. 031005.040 --> 031009.243 That indeed hits. And she didn't roll very well for perception, so you do get sneak attack on this. 031016.136 --> 031018.682 33 031030.846 --> 031032.084 So darting from the side and letting the bubbles go by. She is within 30 feet of you, so 031037.583 --> 031045.883 you do not have the disadvantage. It catches her in the chest, and her hands go forward and she 031045.883 --> 031054.483 leans out of the seaweed for a second to pull it out and let it fall as it slowly begins to drift 031054.483 --> 031059.543 down, sinking into the chamber before reaching back up into the seaweed and holding on to it. 031059.543 --> 031101.103 No. She is immune to the effect of the seaweed. 031105.708 --> 031108.639 So, is that your turn? 031114.160 --> 031115.654 All righty. Finishing Nott's go, Yasha's up. Yasha is frightened. 031118.802 --> 031123.186 She can do that? 031125.860 --> 031127.935 Nah. I think that's a thing that berserkers got. 031134.148 --> 031135.239 I'll double check. 031136.538 --> 031138.527 Yeah that's mindless rage. It's sixth level path of the berserker. It's a little Grog bleeding 031141.505 --> 031142.328 in there. 031142.328 --> 031143.839 All good. 031144.723 --> 031152.233 Caleb is over there. 031154.817 --> 031156.508 Jester's right here. She's technically up on the stair right there. 031218.255 --> 031222.337 I'll say, for the purposes of ease there, Jester is up on that stair there. 031225.248 --> 031229.099 Nope. Up on top of this platform or off to the side? 031231.479 --> 031232.721 There's a little raised section in the center there. 031235.591 --> 031242.832 No. 031249.839 --> 031250.822 Caleb did. 031251.779 --> 031253.163 LAURA AND Yes it does. 031307.328 --> 031309.098 So you're back to consciousness. You're at seven hit points. 031310.733 --> 031312.389 Correct. 031313.119 --> 031314.271 No, Mage Armor is not concentration. 031317.559 --> 031320.181 Yeah. 031326.160 --> 031327.807 Correct. 031328.691 --> 031329.859 Okay, so she goes into a rage? 031331.567 --> 031332.373 All right that ends Yasha's go. At the end of Yasha's turn it's going to use another 031334.339 --> 031338.555 legendary action to use Forced Vision on you, Fjord. I need you to go ahead and make a melee 031338.555 --> 031344.177 attack against Beau, as you glance around and suddenly she's right there in front of you. And 031344.177 --> 031347.485 you take your falchion, swing out to try and take her out. 031347.485 --> 031350.062 Yep. So you have disadvantage on the strike. 031351.611 --> 031353.423 But you do have plus d4s to each of the hits because of Bless. 031355.842 --> 031400.565 Plus a d4. 031401.933 --> 031402.993 Yeah. 031406.521 --> 031409.391 All right. That ends Yasha's turn. Caleb. You are conscious, prone, floating, sinking 031423.189 --> 031426.504 towards the ground as you come to consciousness as Yasha grabs and jolts you awake. 031426.504 --> 031430.838 Yeah, you'd get half cover. Yeah. 031433.122 --> 031435.898 Getting up from prone? 031437.481 --> 031443.072 Yeah, you can get cover. 031444.424 --> 031453.321 That's 4d12. 031502.635 --> 031507.946 Correct. So you have to roll a d20, add your spell attack modifier. 031512.379 --> 031514.034 Yes, technically, because he was concentrating. 031517.361 --> 031522.222 Her armor class is 15. I'm so sorry. 031531.821 --> 031533.457 You release the Witch Bolt and as it fires out and arcs, in a split-second moment the eyes go 031540.095 --> 031545.069 wide and she darts out of the way and it impacts the side of the stone wall. You watch as the 031545.069 --> 031549.548 seaweed she was clutching is burned and falls away for a second, and behind it, you see another one 031549.548 --> 031552.263 of those runes. Just sitting there in the chamber. 031552.263 --> 031554.787 That's your turn. All right, back at the top. Beau, you're up. 031557.631 --> 031559.538 Actually, at the end of Caleb's turn... 031603.025 --> 031605.009 She has three. She's going to use her last one. She's going to go ahead and use Shifting 031614.741 --> 031618.762 Speed. So she's going to move her speed without triggering opportunity attacks. 031618.827 --> 031623.817 (background music) 031623.817 --> 031627.617 Actually she can move ten more feet, so right there. 031630.602 --> 031631.688 Yep. As you watch, she skitters across the wall, grabbing the seaweed and using it, almost 031637.363 --> 031641.138 Tarzan-like, to thrust herself forward, grabbing onto this bit, rolling, and then swimming around 031641.138 --> 031645.874 and is now floating in the air, or floating in the water, right next to where Caduceus is standing. 031645.874 --> 031649.639 Beau, what are you doing? 031649.639 --> 031653.512 From you right now? 031655.147 --> 031658.709 30 feet from you. 031701.218 --> 031707.463 So you jump off the ground and swim forward, cruising through the room, Step of the Wind you 031719.499 --> 031724.461 get one extra push and you land right next to where she is. 031724.461 --> 031727.991 Go for it! 031731.262 --> 031738.277 Yes, because you are underwater still. 031748.770 --> 031755.362 The first strike, as you come forward, this is the first time you get a really good look at 031758.941 --> 031804.022 the face of this terrible creature, and as soon as you come towards, the mouth opens up and you 031804.022 --> 031810.069 barely hold back from the punch and that just gives it enough time to shift out of the way and 031810.069 --> 031811.452 it just hits water. 031811.452 --> 031817.539 That hits. You know now that 15 is the armor class. 031820.832 --> 031825.003 Wisdom ability checks, got it. 031826.594 --> 031827.174 Nine? Nine points of damage. As the first one misses and pulls away, you're like, "Nope!" 031833.472 --> 031841.781 Whack! And then right across the jaw, (cracking sound). Cold and hard. There's a toughness to her. 031841.781 --> 031843.039 All right. Does that finish your turn, Beau? 031844.642 --> 031845.454 All right. Caduceus and Jester, you're up. 031846.956 --> 031848.016 She did technically move around and would've passed through your 15-foot radius, by the way. 031852.417 --> 031853.348 So she does have to make a wisdom saving throw. A five plus one. Six. So that's a failure. 031900.899 --> 031903.025 Go ahead and roll damage for your-- 031903.025 --> 031904.065 Spirit Guardians, yes. 031905.455 --> 031906.153 Caleb and Yasha are no longer frightened of Dashilla. Okay, 13. So you watch as she darts 031938.372 --> 031945.420 across the room as her legendary action. All the floating seahorses suddenly dart up and slam into 031945.420 --> 031949.618 her side, but she still manages to skitter past. All right, so now it's Jester and Caduceus' turn. 031949.618 --> 031953.266 Because you guys are players, I'm giving you the initiative just before the lair action hits, 031953.266 --> 031956.016 because you're all on 20. Go for it. 031956.016 --> 032001.491 On her turn? All right. 032003.667 --> 032004.563 Technically the creature's movement is halved when it moves through. 032022.058 --> 032024.362 It only barely skimmed the side, so it would have lost five foot of movement, so we'll say that 032026.959 --> 032027.962 Dashilla is there. 032027.962 --> 032033.907 No, you're entering hers. She has to enter your area. However, at the start of her turn, it triggers. 032042.585 --> 032047.328 Ooh boy! 032051.681 --> 032053.957 So where are you putting it? 032100.627 --> 032104.604 Like right here? Let her do it. 032107.118 --> 032108.739 Go ahead and roll an attack. 032114.573 --> 032119.192 Yes it does, go ahead and roll damage on that. 032121.142 --> 032126.065 Well you cast it at 4th-level you said, right? That's 3d8. 032129.718 --> 032131.189 Because it's 2nd-level normally, each level you put on top of that-- 032133.342 --> 032135.155 Yeah, for every spell level ahead of two you get another. So 16 plus one more d8. 032141.871 --> 032143.017 All right. So that's 23. 032146.525 --> 032147.553 No, 23. Double eights is 16, plus seven is 23. 032154.320 --> 032155.433 Yeah, because of your wisdom. So 27 points of damage. Whack! The serrated edge of the 032201.326 --> 032210.217 lollipop grinds into her! As it does, black blood spills out from the wound of the chest, the shreds 032210.217 --> 032215.481 of seaweed and cloth pulling off from the front, exposing the sunken rib cage where the flesh is 032215.481 --> 032221.843 pulled taut against, and now the wound itself is open and spilling this trail of cloudy black blood 032221.843 --> 032222.874 in the water. 032222.874 --> 032225.474 Yep. Sacred Flame is a cantrip, so go for it. That's wisdom, or dexterity? 032230.797 --> 032232.287 Dexterity save. That is going to be an 18. 032234.973 --> 032236.580 But that was a nice round. 032237.972 --> 032240.137 All right, finishing up Jester's turn. Caduceus? 032242.995 --> 032246.478 You just watched her dart over you, essentially, Ten feet up above, scoot past, land, 032251.315 --> 032256.451 and then both Jester and Beau converge and start pummelling her in the hallway. 032256.451 --> 032302.600 Welcome to Dungeons &amp; Dragons. 032309.231 --> 032317.510 Okay. Dexterity save. That is going to be a 14. I don't believe that-- 032324.165 --> 032326.274 Yep, so go ahead and roll damage on that. 032329.979 --> 032336.323 Nine points of radiant damage, nice. (spell impact, angry snarl) 032340.512 --> 032345.115 So you turn invisible and you're going to back up into here, into this little corner? 032355.180 --> 032357.498 Oh, there? 032358.460 --> 032402.138 Over here? 032403.361 --> 032406.594 Got it. And you are invisible there. Good to know. All right, at the end of your turn, the lair 032413.414 --> 032420.060 action kicks in. Clouded Waters. Now you watch as the silt, the muck, and the bones all of a sudden 032420.060 --> 032426.160 begin to swirl up into the waters around you and obscure the area. The entire lair is now 032426.160 --> 032430.364 considered heavily obscured. You cannot see more than five feet in front of you. 032430.364 --> 032431.501 It's now Dashilla's turn. She gets her legendary actions back. 032437.096 --> 032438.679 Oh, she's not affected by the obscurity. This is her lair. 032448.046 --> 032449.537 She does, so immediately she has to take the Spirit Guardians. 032451.949 --> 032454.030 Wisdom ability checks, not saving throws. Otherwise hex would be super powerful. But she 032458.991 --> 032500.003 still rolls a 4. 032500.003 --> 032500.777 So do full damage. 032502.441 --> 032505.275 Okay. 032507.957 --> 032511.901 13 points of radiant damage, blasted again as this cluster of vibrant glowing, almost pink 032520.367 --> 032526.358 pulsing sea horses swirl around and pierce through her chest. 032526.358 --> 032527.617 Unicorn horns, of course. I assumed! 032529.673 --> 032531.599 They're just like "wee!" 032535.884 --> 032537.794 It's very like that Perry Bible Fellowship comic. 032542.444 --> 032543.793 The kid gets impaled by the unicorns; I love it so much. All right, so that happens. The top of 032549.644 --> 032556.427 her turn. Yeah, nobody's currently feared by her. 032556.427 --> 032559.338 No, it lasts until the beginning of the next combat round. Okay, she's going to go ahead and do 032615.823 --> 032619.818 a multi-attack with her claws against Beauregard because she's in melee. 032619.818 --> 032620.917 That's two strikes against you, these giant bladed, fingered claws. First one is-- that's a 032628.012 --> 032630.595 natural 14 plus seven. That's 21 to hit. 032630.595 --> 032631.218 The second one is a natural 16. 032633.354 --> 032634.037 All right, so you get hit from each. You take, from the first strike, 12 points of slashing 032641.794 --> 032650.367 damage. The second one, 14 points of slashing damage. In what already was clouded silt is now 032650.367 --> 032655.628 clouded further by your own blood from the slash marks across the front and the side of your neck 032655.628 --> 032700.321 and jaw, and the pain sears through. In an instant, all you see is the claws streaking 032700.321 --> 032704.624 through and the glowing yellow eyes before they rescind back into the cloud. 032704.624 --> 032706.527 Well no, she's going to attempt to move back. Make an attack of opportunity with disadvantage. 032710.501 --> 032714.178 With that she vanishes into-- 032718.494 --> 032722.034 Yeah, just all over. That's going to go ahead and end Dashilla's turn. Fjord, you're up. 032727.805 --> 032734.796 Yes. 032735.521 --> 032737.352 You're a bit shaken by all these visions that keep creeping into your head. 032740.072 --> 032745.272 Yes. I mean you saw her still dart and run this way, and then everything just went dark 032750.575 --> 032753.482 around you and you can't see more than five feet ahead of you. 032753.482 --> 032759.626 It's heavily obscured which means you can still attack that direction, but it's at disadvantage. 032809.793 --> 032815.928 Mm-hmm. 032818.247 --> 032822.767 Okay, wow, that was-- 032837.308 --> 032839.486 All right. Two strikes at disadvantage, go for it. 032842.993 --> 032848.922 That still hits with disadvantage. 032850.693 --> 032854.908 You watch as soon as everything clouds in and you see her vanishing in that distant area. 032901.372 --> 032908.240 You throw them back out there, and through sheer luck and remembering where she was heading, both 032908.240 --> 032913.776 blasts-- you don't even see the impact but you hear the (gasp). Roll damage on each of those. 032913.776 --> 032918.207 Nice! 032929.414 --> 032931.064 Oof, there were some good rounds in that. All right, that's your action? 032934.026 --> 032936.281 Okay, you're going to stay there by the throne? 032938.984 --> 032939.606 That finishes your go, Fjord. Next up, it is Nott. 032942.262 --> 032946.723 You have no idea where she is. You know that she's somewhere in this tunnel. 032949.432 --> 032950.189 Or in that direction. 032951.608 --> 032959.291 You're heavily obscured so you can literally hide anywhere right now. 033010.818 --> 033011.779 You're in a cloud of murk and gathered sediment. 033014.462 --> 033015.218 Are you hiding then as a bonus? 033022.355 --> 033023.023 Roll stealth. 033024.993 --> 033026.936 Okay, and then you are holding-- 033029.808 --> 033034.107 Okay, you got it. All right, that finishes your go. Yasha's turn. 033037.974 --> 033045.041 Yeah. 033045.929 --> 033047.590 It's less-- 033112.466 --> 033115.298 Yeah, not that Yasha would understand with her comparatively limited experience of arcane 033119.976 --> 033124.702 stuff, but it's not so much magical darkness than it is as much of sediment and silt up in the air 033124.702 --> 033128.344 by some sort of-- it's up to her, she can give it a shot. 033128.344 --> 033129.279 All right. 033130.557 --> 033135.768 While staying there? 033137.397 --> 033142.165 You got it. 033151.766 --> 033152.775 Yes it does. Okay, that ends Yasha's go. Caleb. 033158.085 --> 033202.846 Okay, go for it. 033210.626 --> 033211.232 You cast Detect Magic in a 30 foot radius around you. You sense a powerful magical essence 033216.823 --> 033218.483 from the throne next to Fjord. 033218.483 --> 033219.334 Right there? 033239.046 --> 033242.984 Okay, that ends your turn. 033244.506 --> 033246.376 All right, at the end of your turn, Dashilla's going to use a legendary action to use 033250.467 --> 033256.306 Forced Vision on you Fjord. As you're there by the side, you look over by the corner and you see-- 033256.306 --> 033302.611 you don't see Caleb. You see a spirit rushing up towards you with an open maw. Go ahead and make an attack. 033302.618 --> 033304.255 No. 033305.070 --> 033306.213 Because she had Patient Defense on. 033307.635 --> 033308.543 He's not affected by it because of his armor. He's got Mariner's Armor. 033315.581 --> 033317.874 Yeah, no. As you swing, that little bit in the back of your brain resists, and you can see 033332.388 --> 033334.088 for a moment through the illusion-- 033334.088 --> 033336.290 With your mage armor I think you're okay, right? 033339.266 --> 033341.262 Yeah you manage to just pull back enough to pull the blade back and Caleb you watch as it 033346.231 --> 033348.708 spins past, missing you by inches. 033348.708 --> 033351.358 All right. 033357.016 --> 033358.757 Top of the round. It's Beau's go. 033402.415 --> 033410.411 It's made of fucking cookies! 033418.415 --> 033421.274 You don't know. 033422.816 --> 033424.461 She disappeared. You're surrounded by cloud; you can barely see Jester at the peripheral and 033429.069 --> 033433.928 the floating Spiritual Weapon, and you watch her vanish into this swirling bit of murk. 033433.928 --> 033436.408 Okay. 033449.885 --> 033458.323 You got it. All right, so you're holding your attack action. That ends your turn. Caduceus 033503.279 --> 033504.182 and Jester. 033504.182 --> 033506.410 Correct. 033507.242 --> 033509.354 You got it. 033510.850 --> 033511.860 You reappear. 033522.341 --> 033532.641 There? 033534.682 --> 033540.018 Oh, like here? 033543.991 --> 033548.043 Okay, so you're holding Sacred Flame. 033600.466 --> 033614.862 Okay. All right, so you're holding Sacred Flame, you said, right? 033631.108 --> 033632.030 What are you doing, Jester? 033634.655 --> 033641.677 Sure, go ahead and roll attack with disadvantage. 033644.914 --> 033649.143 It hits the fuck out of nothing; she's not there, unfortunately. 033652.633 --> 033704.322 Okay. At the end of the turn, the sediment drops. The moment it drops, she appears. 033716.192 --> 033717.085 She is over here. 033720.612 --> 033722.119 Nope, but both of you get to fire at her. You unfortunately do not see her; she's around the 033726.372 --> 033727.791 corner from you. 033727.791 --> 033731.202 So excited in the moment! 033734.896 --> 033736.391 That's amazing! All right, so roll your damage. 033742.576 --> 033744.706 Yep. 033745.285 --> 033747.540 Natural 19. 033749.669 --> 033751.065 Next attack has advantage on her, yeah. She's starting to look pretty hurt. As it blasts 033805.023 --> 033810.625 into her and lights up the vicinity, between the gash and the various impacts from the Eldritch 033810.625 --> 033815.635 Blasts and the punches from Beau, and now where that impacted, there's now a darkened, burned 033815.635 --> 033822.888 crater in the center of the chest that's beginning to ooze out blood. She's like (heavy breathing). 033822.888 --> 033831.767 All right. Reappears, at which point, the next lair action is going to be Tethering Walls. Any 033831.767 --> 033836.106 creature within ten feet of a wall must make a dexterity saving throw. That's going to be Jester, 033836.106 --> 033842.709 Beau's just out of range, Caduceus. Everybody but Jester, ten feet from a wall. 033842.709 --> 033845.661 Yeah. No, sorry, everybody but Beau. Beau's the one who's central to this chamber. 033849.724 --> 033851.698 She does. What's up? 033853.577 --> 033857.588 Dex save, yes. 033859.453 --> 033900.369 Success. 033901.771 --> 033905.297 Great, success. 033906.902 --> 033908.378 I'm sorry, not you. 033909.470 --> 033910.019 Success. 033910.782 --> 033911.461 Success. 033912.200 --> 033912.945 Caduceus, as the seaweed extends outward, most of you manage to duck out of the way. 033918.748 --> 033927.803 However, it wraps around and pulls Caduceus to the wall. You are grappled and you take 11 points of 033927.803 --> 033928.827 poison damage. 033928.827 --> 033930.273 That ends that. It is now Dashilla's turn. Dashilla is going to go ahead and move ten feet up 033946.591 --> 033947.652 to Jester. 033947.652 --> 033950.106 Well, she actually started within the range, so she makes it. You do. 033954.919 --> 033956.453 You do. Go ahead and make your attack. 033959.311 --> 034001.487 16 hits. 034002.613 --> 034006.222 Correct. 034007.478 --> 034009.071 20 points of damage, oof. Nice. Then the save against yours, a natural 19. So she takes 034020.588 --> 034022.252 half damage. Still roll. 034022.252 --> 034032.935 Five points of damage, reduced to two. She's going to rush toward you and take two claw strikes 034043.593 --> 034052.416 at you. Natural 19! Wow, fucking 19s this past round. Yeah, that's a 26 to hit you. 034052.416 --> 034053.765 On the second strike, a natural 17. 034055.742 --> 034057.127 Yep, they both hit you. You take, ooh, 19 points of slashing damage from the first hit and 034105.944 --> 034107.938 17 points of slashing damage from the second. 034107.938 --> 034111.788 LAURA and That's ten feet of movement, and she's going to-- 034115.363 --> 034117.362 Go for it. 034119.171 --> 034126.867 Nice! Dashilla's looking really bad. 034136.567 --> 034143.331 As it happens, these ice crystals formulate out of the seawater and all cross-jettison into 034149.363 --> 034157.462 her body. Now they're embedded in her chest and torso, these large crystals of shards of jagged 034157.462 --> 034202.521 ice. (snarling) Eyes going wide, looks around. She's going to use the rest of her movement-- 034202.521 --> 034204.171 Speed is halved on the movement, so that's (counting) 60. 034215.151 --> 034216.773 Well, not 50, technically, because 50 is her swimming speed. So right there. 034221.261 --> 034223.430 SAM and That's the end of Dashilla's turn. Fjord, you're up first. 034226.042 --> 034229.265 Yeah. It is water. There is a vertical aspect you guys can use if you want to. 034241.611 --> 034244.387 Okay. There's this cloud of sand and dust and bones that get scattered up from your leap. 034251.813 --> 034255.425 You're up in the air and then throw both forward. Roll attacks. 034255.425 --> 034301.605 Both hit. Roll damage. 034306.572 --> 034314.104 19 points on the second one? 034324.901 --> 034327.954 Okay. Fuck, man, she's right on the cusp! All right. That finishes your turn? 034335.062 --> 034336.234 Legendary action, she's going to Shifting Speed-- 034339.506 --> 034340.668 20, and is out of sight. 034343.497 --> 034344.553 Hex doesn't work that way. That's Hunter's Mark. All right, that finishes Fjord's turn. Nott? 034353.538 --> 034355.835 (mini clicking on map) You still don't see her. 034410.331 --> 034416.726 All right, that ends your turn. Yasha? 034418.894 --> 034420.448 He used action, movement, and bonus. 034423.430 --> 034426.653 It is now Yasha. 034428.618 --> 034430.041 If she rages in advance, she can use advantage on the athletics check. Up to you. 034445.967 --> 034448.032 Yes. Athletics with advantage. 034456.663 --> 034501.002 14's enough. The DC to break is 12. 034504.299 --> 034505.880 It's seaweed. But yeah. She reaches forward and grabs Caduceus and pulls him away from the 034512.679 --> 034514.376 side so now you're no longer grappled. You can move. 034514.376 --> 034515.735 That's her action and her bonus. That finishes Yasha's go. Caleb, you're up. 034518.924 --> 034529.858 You got it. 034531.144 --> 034532.495 Okay. That finishes Caleb's go. Top of the round, Beau. 034536.364 --> 034542.602 Halved, yeah. 034548.215 --> 034549.557 You can move four squares per go, so another (counting) four. You get out the side and you can see-- 034558.871 --> 034559.952 She hasn't had a chance to hide yet. 034601.601 --> 034602.980 You see her right there. 034609.896 --> 034611.141 That the end of your turn? 034616.650 --> 034619.159 End of your turn. 034620.182 --> 034621.962 Legendary action. She's going to go ahead and Shift Speed again. Looks over the corner and 034626.358 --> 034632.011 sees you (hissing) and goes ahead and darts out of sight once more. 034632.011 --> 034632.975 You know the direction where she curved around though. 034635.908 --> 034636.849 That finishes your go. Caduceus and Jester. 034641.465 --> 034644.307 Okay. 034658.989 --> 034701.101 That's as close as you can get right there, I'll say. 034703.772 --> 034705.574 Oh, with burning an action you can get there. 034708.147 --> 034709.220 Okay. 034710.320 --> 034713.213 There you go. 034714.494 --> 034718.243 Okay. That finishes your go. 034720.682 --> 034727.826 You do not see the orb, no. 034730.368 --> 034738.957 Okay. 034740.207 --> 034742.164 That a double move? 034744.793 --> 034747.174 That's as far as you can get on your single move there. 034750.905 --> 034754.838 Rogues, man. 034802.553 --> 034805.510 Yeah because it's your action to move. 034807.291 --> 034814.105 Right there, all right. You move (counting) 20; you get up to the edge there. Well, 034830.646 --> 034837.172 technically 15; you only move 30. All right, that finishes Jester's turn. All of the seaweed falls 034837.172 --> 034841.787 back into a casual place. The next lair action is going to be the Lament of the Dead. 034841.787 --> 034843.174 The dead spirits now begin to fall through at different angles out of the sides of the walls 034848.585 --> 034852.501 and drifting through. Everybody once more needs to make a wisdom saving throw. 034852.501 --> 034854.179 Everybody. 034855.481 --> 034857.731 Through the halls, through everything. 034900.393 --> 034901.028 Success. 034901.820 --> 034902.528 Success. 034903.354 --> 034903.992 Yes. DC is 12 on this. 034908.120 --> 034910.452 Both successes. 034911.508 --> 034912.170 Success. 034912.913 --> 034913.620 Success. 034914.355 --> 034915.803 Huh? 034916.643 --> 034917.671 Yeah, wow. You guys all cleared that check. Nice. 034921.495 --> 034922.635 Lair action, no effect. All right. 034924.782 --> 034925.868 No, don't apologize. 034927.568 --> 034928.708 Dashilla's turn. Dashilla's somewhere. Fjord, what do you do? 034937.118 --> 034945.045 Make a search action? 034946.422 --> 034946.969 Make an investigation check for me. I'll say with advantage because you have the falchion 034949.917 --> 034953.486 drawn. You can sense the presence of something important. 034953.486 --> 034955.187 Correct. 034955.832 --> 034958.089 13 will do it. Going to the throne and sensing with the sword like a homing beacon, you 035007.943 --> 035014.058 feel the strong source where the cushion in the front of the throne is. It's partially rotted, and 035014.058 --> 035021.221 you can see where once was red, nice velvet materials has blackened over time and general 035021.221 --> 035026.263 sediment in the area, and then minerals, begin to gather at the corners. You reach down and tear 035026.263 --> 035030.945 across the front and pull it open, and as you do, there immediately glowing from underneath, you see 035030.945 --> 035035.914 the yellow sphere giving off a faint aura of light. 035035.914 --> 035038.796 I'll let you do that, yeah. 035042.241 --> 035043.459 You take it. 035044.604 --> 035046.401 I'll say, for the time being there is no immediate threat. Dashilla has fled. You can 035104.648 --> 035106.500 continue to search for her, if you'd like. 035106.824 --> 035110.259 Okay, but for the time being, Dashilla has not-- at least, for the time being. 035114.081 --> 035116.533 It does. 035120.556 --> 035124.854 Okay. You continue to move into the next area. 035127.485 --> 035133.376 You scoot around the area. Beau, you start moving through in this vicinity. 035143.622 --> 035145.898 Nott, you doing the same? 035147.475 --> 035148.029 Nott, you're not as fast as her, so you're falling a bit behind. Actually, no, you can do all 035152.934 --> 035156.497 three with your bonus action. Well, you both can, just in case you want to spend ki points. 035157.019 --> 035158.496 Yes? 035201.639 --> 035207.342 Only the aura from the table. 035212.728 --> 035221.914 Okay, make an arcana check. 035229.419 --> 035234.306 It's hard to pick up the details of these particular runes. They seem of a similar age as 035249.767 --> 035259.468 the ones you saw on the table, but it's not the same enchantment. You pick up that they are placed 035259.468 --> 035304.015 there for some reason, but you're unable to ascertain what it is, unfortunately. 035304.015 --> 035313.578 Right, okay. It is not a language, per se. These aren't passages or language being 035326.604 --> 035330.889 transmitted; these are runes of some kind. They are used to channel something. 035330.889 --> 035336.257 They may or may not be connected to the table altar in the center. 035336.257 --> 035339.153 Yeah. 035344.498 --> 035346.292 They both get brighter. 035348.464 --> 035352.773 Yes, you may. As you take the sphere and press it to your chest, your eyes suddenly flash 035402.414 --> 035414.296 images of black, sub-ocean darkness, the same place your dreams have brought you over and over again, and 035414.296 --> 035423.096 that bright yellow light emerges, breaking the shadow, and there you see the yellow eye with two 035423.096 --> 035431.452 more on the sides of it. You see the endless row of teeth that curves into the smile-- and the 035431.452 --> 035438.489 flash is gone, and you look down and your hand is empty. The rest of you watched this thing 035438.489 --> 035449.200 momentarily seem to become either ethereal or it is absorbed into Fjord's chest. You look at the 035449.200 --> 035452.888 sword, and now there's the eye in the hilt and the eye in the pommel. 035452.888 --> 035455.617 While you're beginning to initiate the looting process, what are you doing, Caduceus? 035620.512 --> 035631.656 Okay. Well, you were staying over in this chamber with them. Nott and Beau, you are in the 035652.508 --> 035658.711 central chamber now. Do you want to search for the possible whereabouts of Dashilla? 035658.711 --> 035704.294 Both of you make perception checks. 035712.679 --> 035714.356 All right. As you turn around the corner and you edge in here, you see movement behind the 035733.501 --> 035737.773 seaweed, using it as a blanket and a shield. 035737.773 --> 035740.390 Where you're looking, you see it move this direction. You're not sure which path, but 035746.176 --> 035754.305 Dashilla is still present it seems, or something moving through the seaweed as a cover, behind it 035754.305 --> 035757.616 like a curtain. Which path do you choose? 035757.616 --> 035804.300 Which way? 035808.724 --> 035810.635 You saw her move in the direction of this fork. 035813.060 --> 035814.348 This side? You saw her move in this direction, you saw it move through. 035817.198 --> 035817.860 Take the right? Okay. You move through, and you're following? 035828.087 --> 035828.963 Okay. 035830.099 --> 035840.707 As you come around the corner, you see an old, decomposing pile of merrow corpses similar to 035859.817 --> 035905.825 the ones that were tied up inside, but these all have these wounds of their throats slit from side 035905.825 --> 035907.697 to side. 035907.697 --> 035910.853 They're all in various states of decomposition, the freshest one maybe months ago, 035916.650 --> 035924.912 and the sea has caused its own unique form of bloating and sloughing off of the various parts of 035924.912 --> 035925.986 the skeleton. 035925.986 --> 035926.868 You can make another perception check. 035931.355 --> 035933.312 Glancing inside and taking a moment to really look around, there's no other movement. 035944.201 --> 035945.996 You guys shift around. 035949.944 --> 035953.896 As you turn around to the other side, there you see standing there, another pale, gaunt spirit 040002.143 --> 040004.564 looking right at you. 040004.564 --> 040009.565 Beauregard, doing probably one of my favorite things she's ever done in this entire 040023.553 --> 040028.573 campaign, just runs up to fucking punch a ghost. Go for it. 040028.573 --> 040030.568 11 just hits. 040037.732 --> 040039.991 Five points of damage, okay. 040048.049 --> 040054.055 Another five damage, okay. 040056.794 --> 040058.185 You still have your bonus action. 040100.217 --> 040102.355 15 points of damage. You punch the shit out of a ghost. Now, because I believe at level seven 040116.801 --> 040118.557 you have the capability of-- 040118.557 --> 040119.950 To punch ghosts! 040121.381 --> 040125.027 With each punch, you watch as the somewhat spectral glow scatters at each impact, and as she 040131.309 --> 040135.576 pulls back there are three holes in its form where the fists passed through. The ghost, which was 040135.576 --> 040141.210 normally just staring, goes (ghastly groan) in surprise. 040141.210 --> 040142.910 That is a three. 040149.029 --> 040156.073 All righty. Nott, are you doing anything? 040204.419 --> 040206.419 Ghost is still alive, yeah. 040207.968 --> 040209.700 Go for it. 040211.647 --> 040214.937 14 hits, roll damage. It is adjacent to Beau so you get sneak attack on the ghost. 040219.919 --> 040224.485 It dissipates. You watch as its glow vanishes. This horrible low, dull, vibrating sigh 040240.017 --> 040245.008 slowly goes away and it's no more and he's immaterial. 040245.008 --> 040248.008 Make a perception check. 040254.249 --> 040257.538 Both of you guys make perception checks. 040259.865 --> 040301.719 Okay. You don't see any movement in that corner. You do, looking inside, see in the far 040312.789 --> 040327.339 back a small hole maybe two inches across where the base of it-- of the small alcove-- ends. You 040327.339 --> 040329.031 hear voices. 040329.031 --> 040330.276 It's about two inches wide. 040339.799 --> 040344.105 As you're looting the place, you hear these voices. 040347.047 --> 040349.466 Okay. You suffer three points of damage. As you place your hand down on it, you see this dull 040512.701 --> 040522.261 red glow around the hand that's placed on the table. As you begin to pull your hand up and look, 040522.261 --> 040527.010 the runes where the blood has splattered have begun to give a faint glow. 040527.010 --> 040528.957 Make a perception check. 040534.083 --> 040537.842 You glance over and you can see a faint, matching, dull red glow on one of the runes across 040544.186 --> 040550.964 the way, just barely peeking through some of the gently shifting seaweed. Looking down at this 040550.964 --> 040554.225 table, you need a lot of blood to continue to do this. 040554.225 --> 040559.361 How much damage are you willing to take, guys? 040605.050 --> 040606.468 As you guys begin carving into your hands-- 040615.144 --> 040616.565 Okay. The blood clouds the water around you, and then you watch as it is drawn like a magnet to 040627.363 --> 040634.720 the tabletop. As it begins to sit itself in, each of the runes begins to pull in with each one 040634.720 --> 040642.555 glowing, another rune and the rune (low sounds). It's almost full, the table isn't there yet. You 040642.555 --> 040650.801 have about two-thirds to three-quarters or so. The room itself now is beginning to generally have a 040650.801 --> 040653.995 red hue to it as each of these runes is beginning to fill the area. 040653.995 --> 040655.585 Make an investigation check. 040815.395 --> 040817.800 Yeah. 040818.451 --> 040829.610 I know. You gather in pocket, and counting it later, you will find that you have found 040838.861 --> 040849.602 roughly three platinum, six gold, 12 silver, and about 65 copper. 040849.602 --> 040850.696 She's got an uncomfortable look on her face after watching all this transpire, goes, "Yeah. I 040908.333 --> 040909.923 "think we better should." 040909.923 --> 040912.659 Her brow tenses and she follows you out. As you all converge towards the central chamber once more-- 040918.710 --> 040920.815 As you're walking, some of the seaweed reaches out and the unicorns (fizzle). It lasts 040925.750 --> 040934.336 for ten minutes, right? As you approach they eventually flitter out. You all gather there at 040934.336 --> 040935.826 the entrance. 040935.826 --> 040937.496 Are you all backing out of the cavern? 040940.605 --> 040944.364 Okay. For those who haven't rolled perception checks on this, which I think would be 040948.052 --> 040952.527 Jester, Caleb, and Fjord, go ahead and roll for me. And Yasha. 040952.527 --> 040954.759 No sign of movement. No idea where she is. 041007.452 --> 041015.765 Thanks to the glory of magic, we're not going to deal with decompression in the bloodstream. 041037.966 --> 041039.367 Instant TPK. 041040.687 --> 041042.197 Well, the magic is pulling-- Yeah, it's fine! Magic handwave. It'd be the saddest-- Smash 041048.560 --> 041051.657 cut to the outside of the Squalleater. 041051.657 --> 041055.506 It's all just the end of Total Recall, right there in the middle of the ocean. 041058.537 --> 041100.432 I know. I'm saying through the magic, it all works out fine. As you guys all swim out of the 041104.258 --> 041110.522 cavern, the spell happens. With immense speed, you all start firing towards the surface (splashing) 041110.522 --> 041117.042 with enough force that when you surface, you all lift a few feet out and then land. Some of you 041117.042 --> 041120.749 stumble, but you hit the surface of the water, and it feels like ground. 041120.749 --> 041124.471 You guys can see the Squalleater is a bit of a hike from where you currently are from where 041150.737 --> 041154.995 you've traveled, but it is visible as there is no other landmass on the horizon. 041154.995 --> 041158.210 Correct. 041159.270 --> 041201.070 You guys make your way towards the Squalleater, hail your team, and are brought back 041214.489 --> 041223.588 onto the ship. The sails are unfurled. As Orly turns to you, he goes, "Where we going, Captain?" 041223.588 --> 041234.040 Gravid Archipelago, all righty. 041236.692 --> 041239.959 "Aye, aye." 041241.321 --> 041243.064 You're not there. 041245.776 --> 041247.307 The ship unfurls the functional sails on it and slowly limps its way in the direction of the 041254.310 --> 041304.074 archipelago. You travel for a good hour or so before you notice the sky that was somewhat 041304.074 --> 041319.132 cloudy, begin to go rapidly darker, roughly near where you were. The clouds begin to swell and 041319.132 --> 041324.663 release rain. It begins to rain on your ship, but you begin to push away from this mounting storm. 041324.663 --> 041329.651 You get the sense that whatever ritual you began, once she felt safe, she had completed and a 041337.582 --> 041346.725 new storm is being summoned over the Diver's Grave. 041346.725 --> 041352.431 At least there would have been a hell of a skill challenge to get the Squalleater out of the 041408.682 --> 041416.223 center of that storm. As you barely skirt the outside of this growing storm with enough 041416.223 --> 041420.991 foresight and speed to not be caught in the brunt of it, we'll end tonight's game. 041420.991 --> 041426.175 Bisaft Isle to get repairs done? 041436.468 --> 041437.831 All right. We'll pick up there next week, and we'll have a guest next week. 041506.720 --> 041507.680 Yeah, excited. We'll be having Deborah Ann Woll joining us-- 041511.565 --> 041514.881 (noises of excitement) 041514.881 --> 041516.756 At least two. Excited she's going to be joining us, and we'll pick up this next thread of 041524.235 --> 041529.876 the story. Well done, guys! That was fun and Dashilla survived! 041529.876 --> 041531.380 Yeah, if that had happened while you guys got out of the cave, you would have looked up and 041544.862 --> 041549.009 that sunlight was much darker, and it would have been you start seeing the shifting in the 041549.009 --> 041551.251 tumultuous surface and be like, "Oh, no." 041551.251 --> 041554.413 Sometimes you got to poke the badger, and I respect that. 041556.899 --> 041558.505 You did. 041559.859 --> 041607.403
