Yep. Give it a second. Sorry, my phone died! Because Periscope eats your battery. But good news is it saved me the time of you guys awkwardly watching me unravel so much. It's an involved process releasing a red dragon from its prison. It's okay. Getting there. Oh my god, there's so much of these little things everywhere! Hey-o! Cut him out. Crazy. There's too many! Ugh! They secured the hell out of this guy, understandably so. I'm glad there's not going to be video on the internet of me awkwardly attempting to free Thordak from his box. That's a cool idea. Missed that one, too. So many little wrappings! Ugh! Relinquish my dragon, I want to play with him! "How do I get this thing working?! Oh, be patient, Jeremy! You'll get your present!" All right. There's that. He's free. I got a fire breathe, it looks like. That's going in the right direction. I think so, yeah. Nah, I'm about to lose this battle against Thordak, at the moment, so don't feel too bad. Oh, it's underneath? What the shit?! I don't feel quite so bad about it. Damn, man! Jesus! Thordak does not want to be unleashed. Thordak's like, "I'm good, guys! I'm fine! I'll just--" Yeah, you know what? Here's how I'm going to do this. I'm losing. And with that, ladies and gentlemen. That is Thordak. The other Thordak. There are now two Thordaks. It's so fucking beautiful. You guys don't even know what you've done tonight. (silly voice) "There aren't rules in the book for my challenge rating!" What? No. That's weird. Why would I say that? That's weird. It's fun to freak them out. It's really a lot of fun. Travis has the best reactions. He's always like, "So what does that mean?" You guys wanted to see a comparison size, here. There's Thordak and the minis that I got tonight. (silly voice) "Hey guys! What's going on this way?" (growling) (growling) (heavy breathing) I'm an adult. He does now! (whooshing) Use it like a club. Ugh! (whooshing) Exactly. My breath weapon. (strange noises) With that, folks, me and Marisha and Thordak The Cinder King would like to wish you all a wonderful evening's rest. Thank you for kicking along with us tonight for as long as you have. We'll see you guys next week. (deep voice) "I work out, don't worry. I've been doing CrossFit for about six months, guys."
