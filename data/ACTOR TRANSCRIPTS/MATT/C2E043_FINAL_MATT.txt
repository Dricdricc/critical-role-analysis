Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us 000003.047 --> 000005.707 nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. 000005.707 --> 000007.810 That was a good one, Liam. Well done. Before we get started on tonight's chaos-- because we've 000012.964 --> 000018.862 missed you guys these past two weeks. We had the fantastic all-honey Honey Heist in this place last 000018.921 --> 000026.182 week. Everyone did a great job on that one. Now we're back to see what's going to happen here. We 000026.182 --> 000029.902 left it a little chaotic last time. Before we get to that, we have some announcements to get 000029.902 --> 000034.524 through, starting with our fantastic returning sponsors of campaign two, D&amp;D Beyond. 000034.524 --> 000035.797 Sam? 000036.651 --> 000045.833 Wow. Thank you, Sam. 000429.733 --> 000434.416 The Heroes of the Vale thing is actually-- well, that's friend of the show, T.J. Storm. Todd 000442.962 --> 000447.968 Kenreck also. Mearls is amazing. I've had the opportunity to play with him a couple times, and 000448.040 --> 000451.007 he's a fantastic DM. Super excited they're actually putting that show together. 000451.766 --> 000454.111 Yes. Oh, and Shelly's in there too. That's right. Awesome. Check that out. All right. Thank 000457.815 --> 000458.917 you, Sam. 000458.917 --> 000500.124 Also, while we're on the topic of Sam, you can check out Sam's recent fireside chat we had 000507.332 --> 000508.854 earlier this week. 000508.854 --> 000510.090 He did have his thighs. It was unlocked because of your guys' fantastic contributions to 000514.315 --> 000519.383 Pablove's charity that we ran this past month or two ago. You can check it out now at 000519.383 --> 000524.135 youtube.com/criticalrole. Through the month of November, we're still raising money for Travis' 000524.135 --> 000527.104 favorite charity, Operation Supply Drop. 000527.186 --> 000530.794 Thank you for that. 000609.058 --> 000610.474 Another fun thing. We've teamed up with our good friend, Patrick Rothfuss, and his fantastic 000613.888 --> 000621.111 charity, Worldbuilders, to create a special set of Vox Machina single-use buff cards that can be used 000621.186 --> 000624.960 for your own home games. I ask all you dungeon masters out there, if one of your players brings 000624.960 --> 000629.698 one of these to the table, to the best of your ability, please allow the one use the card allows 000629.698 --> 000633.887 because, if not, you hate charitable things, and you're a terrible person. They paid good money to 000633.887 --> 000640.204 help good people to use these cards. If your DM won't let you, you let me know. 000640.204 --> 000642.944 An eight. That's on par for me, I think. 000650.480 --> 000652.317 Not high enough for me. I'm not an intimidating sort. 000654.836 --> 000657.730 Yeah. Persuasion I can do. For an example, we have the Grog card, where a player of any 000704.434 --> 000710.846 character can rage once during a combat, regardless of their class, as you want to. 000710.846 --> 000712.324 Or we have the Vex card, allows you a charisma boost to a persuasion check because you 000716.286 --> 000720.581 wink, and it improves it dramatically. For every $10 you donate, you'll be entered to win one of 000720.581 --> 000726.121 these cards. All proceeds go to the Heifer Foundation, who provide long-term solutions for 000726.121 --> 000730.977 people in need in ways that help those individuals prosper and in turn support their communities. For 000730.977 --> 000743.645 more info, and to donate and be a part of this, check out http//bit.ly/wbdnd. One more time, you 000743.645 --> 000747.623 can put in bit.ly/wbdnd. 000747.623 --> 000749.441 Exactly. Excited to be working with Patrick on that. I think you had another announcement. Do 000758.756 --> 000800.240 you want to make it for us? 000800.240 --> 000806.311 The author's pretty cool too. 000834.407 --> 000835.515 Well, thank you for that. Excited to see that go up. 000856.620 --> 000858.868 I think that's all we have for our announcements, so with that, my friends-- 000904.018 --> 000906.537 Let's jump in to tonight's episode of Critical Role. 000912.241 --> 000915.877 [TV static, click] 000915.877 --> 001033.127 [groovy Critical Role theme] 001033.909 --> 001035.978 Oh, I had two noses? There we go. That's much better. Thank you, Sam, for that nightmare fuel. 001044.856 --> 001045.969 All right. Last we left off, the Mighty Nein had allied themselves with Captain Avantika of the 001057.230 --> 001103.378 Squalleater, a pirate making her way through the Swavain Islands in search of ways to unlock this 001103.378 --> 001109.871 entity that she was fanatically obsessed with, this Uk'otoa, which was revealed to be the patron 001109.871 --> 001119.187 to Fjord's abilities. After retrieving one of these sought-after orbs from this long-reused 001119.187 --> 001125.672 temple by the snake folk on the island, and apparently unlocking one of these seals, you made 001125.672 --> 001131.978 your way back to Darktow on her ship, did a bit of piracy. Arrived, were introduced to the Plank 001131.978 --> 001139.901 King, who looks over the Revelry, the band of pirates that helm this side, pardon me, of the 001139.901 --> 001147.553 Lucidian Ocean. You then decided to have a plan to break into the Squalleater at night while everyone 001147.553 --> 001153.070 was at rest, or some of you at rest. Some were distracting the captain. In doing so, you managed 001153.070 --> 001159.387 to uncover a well-hidden journal of Avantika that was written in some sort of a cipher. 001159.387 --> 001200.456 Kind of like the journal. Didn't quite look like that, but artistic interpretation. Your 001207.440 --> 001217.931 entrance was solid. Your exit left a couple of signs of disturbance, but nothing implicating. You 001217.931 --> 001223.971 returned, and through the evening and the luck of a ridiculous roll, you managed to, via Caleb, 001223.971 --> 001230.575 break the cipher on it, after knowing what information was there through your spell, and 001230.575 --> 001236.973 write a cipher to allow anybody to read the contents of this journal and see what's within. 001236.973 --> 001243.682 However, the morning in which you awoke, you discovered that the crew, at least, had seemed to 001243.682 --> 001249.754 have noticed all these strange events through the night. The ransacked chamber pointed to some 001249.754 --> 001257.601 tomfoolery. You were all asked to make your way to the shipyard to meet with Avantika and the crew on 001257.601 --> 001304.878 the Squalleater. With not far behind you on the docks the rest of the crew of the Mistake being 001304.878 --> 001312.922 brought as well. Upon you stepping up and encountering this moment of tension, it seems 001312.922 --> 001322.929 that, through Vera's glance through some form of divination magic, while some people have guarding 001322.929 --> 001331.032 objects or items against themselves being sought through divination, certain objects in pockets are 001331.032 --> 001339.147 not free of it. They glanced over in Caleb's direction, and in that moment, you cast Wall of 001339.147 --> 001349.280 Fire. Before we get too far into this, I need you to place your Wall of Fire for me, please, on this battlefield. 001349.280 --> 001351.049 Okay, while you're doing this, I'm going to put this up there, now the announcements are complete. 001423.250 --> 001428.125 Yeah, best you can. 001432.324 --> 001433.980 Oh, you're creating a U? 001437.956 --> 001439.045 Okay. 001444.548 --> 001446.365 This is it. This is the entire thing. 001455.471 --> 001456.372 Okay. We'll place it here. 001504.889 --> 001509.462 We'll say that he is currently-- 001510.685 --> 001510.953 That was amazing. 001527.311 --> 001530.033 All righty. Meticulous placement be damned. 001535.057 --> 001537.572 Yeah. 001538.659 --> 001540.845 It's fine. Liam, leave it. Leave it alone! You've lost miniature privileges. 001547.785 --> 001552.276 In the final moment-- we lost one of them up top, too. 001557.677 --> 001604.735 Sure. That'll do. 001609.384 --> 001612.533 Perfect. Now meticulously, carefully placed to not waste anyone's time. At that moment, you 001630.638 --> 001636.894 all, noticing this moment of tension, there's a flash from Caleb's hands. Figures, their eyes dart 001636.894 --> 001644.126 in his direction as he finishes releasing his arms and firing out of the actual deck of the ship, you 001644.126 --> 001651.739 see a 20-foot tall high wall of roaring flame and fire burn around in a U-shape encompassing the 001651.739 --> 001655.628 exterior. You can feel the heat on you, but it's not so intense as to hurt. However, I need you to 001655.628 --> 001657.787 roll damage. 001657.787 --> 001659.799 Correct. That's 5d8 fire damage, if you don't mind. 001702.979 --> 001704.639 That's a success for the dwarf over there. He takes-- 001731.631 --> 001734.059 That's a shame. Eight damage for him. For Bouldergut, that is a failure. 001740.745 --> 001745.196 Mm-hmm. 17 for Bouldergut. To the guy it got put on directly, that's a failure on his point. He 001754.036 --> 001759.650 takes a full 17 points of damage. The guy who's guarding the other plank there, that's a failure 001759.650 --> 001809.339 on him. He takes 17. Avantika fails with a natural one. Avantika takes a full 17. Then we have the 001809.339 --> 001817.768 guy over there. He fails with a three. He takes another 17. Then Vera rolls a natural 20. Vera's 001817.768 --> 001825.283 right there. Vera takes eight. Now that the Wall of Fire is in place, crackling around you, 001825.283 --> 001831.287 blackening the surface of the deck, the roaring of its sound as it (whooshing), roll initiative, please. 001831.287 --> 001835.997 I pre-rolled initiative for the guys here to keep it going. 25 to 20? 001845.591 --> 001850.623 All right. 20 to 15, anybody? 001859.479 --> 001901.803 We have Jester and Yasha. 001906.883 --> 001908.724 15 to ten? 001913.440 --> 001914.672 Fjord at 11. 001920.424 --> 001923.216 All right. Ten to five? 001929.424 --> 001930.985 That's all right. Top of the combat round, as the flames are crackling around, you hear 001955.873 --> 002000.554 screams from crewmen that are too close and having to pull back and someone starts shouting "Fire!" 002000.554 --> 002005.321 off to the side, from this side of the docks. Beau, you're up first. What are you doing? 002005.321 --> 002006.847 Isn't it, though? That's fine. That'll work. 002045.575 --> 002048.902 No. Only an action. 002051.233 --> 002053.527 I'll say running up to him and then going, "Give me the book," him rummaging through it or 002058.534 --> 002101.920 you helping him rummage through and grab it? I'll consider that an action because that takes a few 002101.920 --> 002109.983 seconds to do. It's not something he had ready. You've moved 15 feet to get over there and then 002109.983 --> 002111.044 your action. 002111.044 --> 002112.781 Jester was right next to you when you started. 002115.505 --> 002117.696 That's another 15 feet. That's 30 foot of your movement. 002121.737 --> 002124.460 Okay. That finishes Beau's go. Avantika's up next. 002132.019 --> 002138.380 She cannot see, but what she can do is Control Water. 002144.937 --> 002147.213 Seeing this flames happen, she (groans), pulls back, closes her eyes for a second, and 002153.109 --> 002200.033 raises her scarred hand where the sphere that she unlocked Uk'otoa with raised up. At that point, 002200.033 --> 002203.526 the water from the ocean begins to rise-- 002203.526 --> 002205.477 All right. It's a 4th-level spell, so I need you to roll. 002211.094 --> 002214.588 She does! 002220.121 --> 002224.931 (cheering and laughter) 002224.931 --> 002228.565 Holy shit! You watch as the ocean begins to swell upwards. Avantika raises her arm-- but you 002246.988 --> 002251.337 said the walls are opaque. Can you see through the walls? 002251.337 --> 002254.190 Make a perception check. 002255.615 --> 002257.220 (groaning) 002257.220 --> 002258.982 Yeah, it doesn't require you to have seen the person. You know the spell's happening, you 002319.825 --> 002326.083 know the direction of the person. You rolled a high enough perception. I'll allow it. As you hear 002326.083 --> 002330.745 her chanting beneath her breath and you hear the wave rising, you glance over in the direction and 002330.745 --> 002337.935 you, having an instinctual affinity with flames and fire, can barely see the darkened shape of her 002337.935 --> 002343.006 on the opposite side of the flames being warped by the light. Using that moment, you put your hand 002343.006 --> 002348.374 forward and release the destructive pattern of your Counterspell. With that, the swelling ocean 002348.374 --> 002350.766 splatters back down to the surface. 002350.766 --> 002356.241 As that happens you hear her go, "<i>Merde</i>!" and she begins to back up over to here onto the 002405.209 --> 002411.938 side and starts shouting, "Vera!" That's going to end her turn, because that was her action. 002411.938 --> 002413.505 Jester. 002414.326 --> 002425.776 From where you are right now? It's probably somewhere between 1200 and 1500 feet, maybe? 002435.825 --> 002441.107 Beau and Jester vanish from sight in a puff of purplish-pink smoke. They both are gone. That's 002518.283 --> 002519.359 your action. 002519.359 --> 002520.104 You suddenly find yourself appearing in the center of the cobblestone street, with The Bloated 002526.301 --> 002530.612 Cup maybe about two or three blocks up that way on the familiar path you know that you took, hooking 002530.612 --> 002534.298 around the side that led you to the Throne Roost. 002534.298 --> 002535.378 You also do notice now that there are some folks and some of The Revelry watch that are now 002545.765 --> 002551.361 glancing over at the very bright inferno that is this beacon of flame over there in the shipyard. 002551.361 --> 002555.345 You appear out of nowhere and there's two of them that look over in your direction, noticing you 002555.345 --> 002600.622 appear. That's all. That's all that happens. You still have your movement and your bonus. 002600.622 --> 002609.251 Okay. Good to know. That finishes Jester's go. Yasha's up. 002614.882 --> 002622.856 You're down two party members in the middle of a U of flames. 002629.105 --> 002636.150 That's two hours of online research about Control Water and Wall of Fire and interactions 002639.476 --> 002642.461 completely mute. That is awesome. 002642.461 --> 002647.732 LIAM and What are you doing, Yasha? 002651.461 --> 002703.053 If she doesn't make an attack and isn't attacked, she loses her rage. 002707.145 --> 002712.223 Okay. She scoots by the one guy who's currently-- so that'd be (counting) 35 right there. 002722.854 --> 002724.336 So she can get there. As she swings by, the one guy that's currently in the wall of fire is 002729.226 --> 002732.336 like, "Shit!" He glances out of the corner of his eye and sees her go by and he gets one attack of 002732.336 --> 002742.738 opportunity swinging at her as she streaks through the space. That's going to be a 15 to hit. 002742.738 --> 002744.498 Okay. In an errant backhand swing-- she's got meaty hit points, though. That's going to be 002752.736 --> 002756.799 eight points of slashing damage to Yasha as she rushes past. 002756.799 --> 002802.783 Okay. 002803.605 --> 002805.831 She's not going to do anything with her action? She can dash with her action and move 002808.534 --> 002809.633 again if you're trying to get her to move. 002809.633 --> 002816.870 40. What's her movement? 002818.085 --> 002820.375 All right. As she charges past, that guard sees her running and goes, "Wait!" There's a huge 002828.876 --> 002832.508 distraction now. This person here who saw all of a sudden the flames erupt who was part of Avantika's 002832.508 --> 002836.554 crew, one of the crew members, is going to take an attack of opportunity at her as well as she runs 002836.554 --> 002840.974 past. She is raging, though, so she takes half damage. Ooh, that's going to be a 21 to hit. 002840.974 --> 002842.374 She takes another eight damage, but it's reduced to four. That finishes Yasha's go. 002847.283 --> 002848.893 Caduceus, you're up. 002848.893 --> 002853.882 You see Yasha run past you. You look over and you watch as Beau and Jester (blink). They're gone. 002901.153 --> 002910.934 We'll find out. Movement 30 if you're rushing past her. 002917.224 --> 002920.601 There are three ways off the boat. There's either this gangplank, which is closer to you, 002925.074 --> 002929.014 this gangplank, which is further from you but generally will meet the same distance, or jumping 002929.014 --> 002930.263 in the water. 002930.263 --> 002933.823 (counting) 30 gets you halfway on the plank there. 002942.902 --> 002949.961 (counting) 30. You're right behind Yasha. That character does not get an attack of 002955.381 --> 003002.468 opportunity on you because they already used their reaction to hit Yasha. 003002.468 --> 003009.788 Okay, that finishes your turn. Now it's Fjord. Aside from Avantika, the rest of them 003014.570 --> 003017.573 rolled piss-poor initiative, which is to your advantage. 003017.573 --> 003025.640 You are currently, yes. As far as Wall of Fire goes, I'm checking the damage on that, is 003029.201 --> 003031.650 that at the top of their turn? 003031.650 --> 003033.139 Oh, at the end of each turn. 003034.732 --> 003037.571 First time they enter it. Got you, okay, good to know. So if they don't leave that area-- 003042.208 --> 003045.501 Got you. All right, cool. Thank you. 003047.967 --> 003053.740 You are going to begin casting Thunder Step... 003102.212 --> 003104.152 You're readying it as a spell? 003105.191 --> 003107.311 To trigger the instant Nott moves. You've got it. Okay. 003111.833 --> 003114.052 Got you. He said moves. All right, that finishes your go, now it's Bouldergut's turn. 003123.972 --> 003131.800 Bouldergut, angry about the flames goes (angry groan). Looking aback, batting at them a little 003131.800 --> 003139.330 bit with her arm, goes and steps through the wall. She takes the damage again. Roll another 5d8. That 003139.330 --> 003144.972 is going to step into the space where the flames are no longer touching her and on the outside it's 003144.972 --> 003147.574 not burning. 003147.574 --> 003154.273 Yeah, they don't get a saving throw by walking through it. She takes your damage. What's 003157.821 --> 003158.632 the damage? 003158.632 --> 003159.833 Bouldergut comes through singed. You see it as bits of her hair are curled up and red at the 003205.820 --> 003211.799 tips from where elements of it have turned to ember and takes a giant swing with her two-handed 003211.799 --> 003214.121 great club at you. 003214.121 --> 003216.998 Yeah, that is. That's a 23 to hit. 003221.154 --> 003222.472 All right, so with that, that's 15 points of bludgeoning damage. Make a constitution save. 003232.873 --> 003234.609 It's half or ten, whichever is higher. So, constitution saving throw. 003239.630 --> 003240.890 Only ability checks are at disadvantage, not saving throws. 003242.511 --> 003244.248 Just roll one more time. 003246.081 --> 003248.569 Fantastic. She swings with her second attack. That is 19 to hit. 003301.739 --> 003303.088 That-- Ooh. 17 points of damage. Another DC10, make another constitution saving throw. 003313.068 --> 003320.736 The flames flicker out as your concentration is abruptly broken by the ogre that stepped 003330.240 --> 003342.046 through the fire wall and twice bashed-- Ford and Caleb right there. 003342.046 --> 003344.525 That ends Bouldergut's turn. Now that comes to Nott and Vera going at the same time in the 003358.827 --> 003403.391 same initiative count. You have a higher dexterity than Vera, so I'm letting you go first. 003403.391 --> 003411.410 Five, ten, 15. You're triggering your... 003416.160 --> 003417.037 Thunder Step. 15. Are you going down the gangplank? 003419.810 --> 003427.491 So, what do you do now? You do... 003429.297 --> 003431.718 In what radius? 003433.539 --> 003434.726 Within ten feet? That will get Bouldergut. It won't get anybody else. After slamming her club 003442.686 --> 003446.676 twice into Caleb, you're holding his shoulder as the impact is causing him to nearly crumple 003446.676 --> 003451.898 against you. You lift him up under the arm right as the spell finishes and (thunder crack). 003451.898 --> 003459.260 You are over here. All right. 003511.098 --> 003512.519 With a loud, heavy burst of thunder, impacts-- 003515.880 --> 003517.137 Crackling through the air surrounding the shipyard. With that, both Caleb and Fjord vanish 003522.537 --> 003528.577 and reappear across the distance, landing on the creaking wood of the old rickety dock. Hearing the 003528.577 --> 003533.737 footsteps behind you of Caduceus and Yasha trying to catch up, the guard all looking confused at 003533.737 --> 003539.537 what's transpiring, and a little ways down the way you can see there's about five or six other guards 003539.537 --> 003543.481 that are walking alongside the rest of the crew of The Mistake that are all stopping and seeing 003543.481 --> 003548.489 what's going on here. That's the end of your go. You still have 15 feet of movement. 003548.489 --> 003556.308 Okay. 003602.447 --> 003603.351 Roll for an attack. 003605.261 --> 003606.647 It's not. 003607.846 --> 003611.448 14? You needed a 15. Yeah, that Mage Armor manages to deflect it. 003616.416 --> 003620.780 All right, you're right before Yasha. With that, Vera is going to take her turn. Vera steps 003636.697 --> 003646.218 up the side (counting) 30 and is now up on the top of the ship glancing over as everyone charges 003646.218 --> 003655.187 past. She raises her arm, "Come, great serpent of the sea!" and she raises her hand above and brings 003655.187 --> 003659.570 her fingers together into a fist as she brings it down slowly like there's force against her fist. 003659.570 --> 003706.298 You watch as this white cloud begins to appear and hailstone-like shards of ice begin to pelt down 003706.298 --> 003713.658 onto the dock below into this radius right here. It does manage to get the guard as well. 003713.658 --> 003716.558 What that does is it also turns this area into rough terrain until the end of her next turn. 003729.062 --> 003732.786 He is there. You guys are all here. 003732.786 --> 003735.165 The cloud has vanished now. 003736.370 --> 003737.696 However, I need you all to make... Here we go. It's an Ice Storm spell. Dexterity saving 003750.267 --> 003755.369 throw from the three of you please. If you don't mind. 003755.369 --> 003757.025 Success for you. 003757.855 --> 003759.105 Success for you, and roll for Yasha as well if you don't mind. 003801.854 --> 003803.716 Yasha fails. Yasha takes 22 points of cold damage. That's 11 points to Caduceus and Nott. 003823.483 --> 003827.506 Although none to you because you succeeded and you have evasion, so you take none. 003827.506 --> 003829.856 That's what rogues can do! Yeah, whenever you have to make a dex save against an effect, 003834.470 --> 003839.357 take half damage. If you succeed, you take no damage. If you fail, you take half. You should 003839.357 --> 003840.766 read your character sheet. 003840.766 --> 003844.109 Yes you may. 003844.937 --> 003847.058 So you get to re-roll that. Once. 003848.925 --> 003850.550 Okay, so she only takes 11. However everything in this, for the next round, is 003854.517 --> 003858.404 difficult terrain as there's now giant hailstones and sleet slicked all over the rickety docks. 003858.404 --> 003859.266 Yes. 003859.849 --> 003901.525 That's going to end Vera's go. Now it comes to Caleb. 003907.365 --> 003910.225 Hanging over here on the side. 003911.227 --> 003915.828 There are two chests off to the side there. 003917.725 --> 003927.783 Okay, go for the roll on that. 003932.624 --> 003935.287 He's throwing one of the chests over here. 003936.838 --> 003938.310 You dart forward across-- the guards that are there watching this happen with the rest of 004005.103 --> 004010.944 the crew of The Mistake, you zip past them in this blur, Flash-like entity. They all get pushed back 004010.944 --> 004017.432 from the impact as you push through. All right. That finishes your turn. Now it's the 004017.432 --> 004021.586 guards. The guards-- 004021.627 --> 004023.301 That guard did take damage. 004024.228 --> 004025.066 He's looking real rough. He's going to back up out of the middle of the sleet and make his way 004035.606 --> 004039.995 this way. He looks dazed and is trying to figure out what's going on and where to ally himself 004039.995 --> 004047.165 with. You guys go running off the side as the flames are down. They're going to give chase. This 004047.165 --> 004050.712 guard's going to rush up here and this guy's going to rush up here. They're not attacking, but 004050.712 --> 004055.761 they're coming out towards you and saying, "Stop! Stop! Halt!" They're shouting towards you guys to 004055.761 --> 004105.482 stop. The rest of the guards are going to push forward and start making their way up this 004105.482 --> 004111.444 direction and they're starting to-- They're now catching up. Four of them are going up towards 004111.444 --> 004116.425 Fjord and one of them is going back towards Caleb. They're starting to gather and they're putting up 004116.425 --> 004122.297 their hands like do not flee. They're not talking yet, but you see their physicality is like, we 004122.297 --> 004124.646 don't know what's happening but don't you go anywhere. 004124.646 --> 004127.804 That ends their go. It's now Ipess' turn. As a bonus action, he's going to hide and move 004143.495 --> 004148.507 underneath and around the rocks to this side and he's going to pull around from the corner with his 004148.507 --> 004155.079 hand crossbow and take a shot at Caduceus from behind. Caduceus, what's your passive perception? 004155.109 --> 004157.867 18, okay. You do notice him out of the corner of your eye just barely, so he is not 004203.009 --> 004207.540 hidden from you. This means he does not get sneak attack damage or advantage on the attack. That is 004207.540 --> 004209.277 still a natural 20 on this hit. 004209.277 --> 004213.540 Which one? 004214.533 --> 004221.388 What does it say? What's the wording? 004224.997 --> 004227.108 When you or a creature? 004228.066 --> 004228.478 Then yeah! 004229.456 --> 004231.158 You channel divinity to prevent the critical. It is now a regular hit. Fantastic. You 004236.508 --> 004245.446 take three points of piercing damage. It sticks into your shield and grinds inside and actually 004245.446 --> 004249.469 hits a little bit of the forearm, but you manage to deflect most of the impact and bolt gets caught 004249.469 --> 004251.926 in the center of there, mostly no damage to you. 004251.926 --> 004256.660 One of the guards turns and looks towards Ipess-- Actually both of these guards turn and 004301.381 --> 004306.307 glance over and having this moment of not entirely certain which side to go with. 004306.307 --> 004310.560 That ends there. It's now the rest of the crew's turn. He's going to come to the side there, 004318.421 --> 004329.001 this one's going to move over to this side there, this guy's going to run across, this one's going 004329.001 --> 004339.641 to move over here, and this half orc's going to go and hide in there. 004339.641 --> 004340.883 With that, we've got some heavy crossbow action from this guy and this guy. Caleb is out of 004355.922 --> 004407.301 range of both of them unfortunately. Both of these guys right here, I'm going to roll four attacks. 004407.301 --> 004412.779 One of them is going to be heavy crossbow to Fjord, because Fjord is still within-- Oh no, it's 004412.779 --> 004415.320 a 400-foot range for the next one. 004415.320 --> 004416.779 Yeah, heavy crossbow. With 100 feet, you're going to be within the disadvantage range 004421.541 --> 004424.451 increment but those things are going to fire at you, Caleb. Since you're the one that's the 004424.451 --> 004425.310 furthest away. 004425.310 --> 004427.240 No. 004427.772 --> 004428.841 He does have disadvantage on the attack though. That is a 16 and a 13 naturally. 004434.591 --> 004435.385 Plus four, it's going to be 17. 004437.107 --> 004438.746 That is nine points of piercing damage to you. 004448.107 --> 004449.636 Are you serious? 004450.565 --> 004452.635 Caleb (thud). As he darts past, this bolt streaks past, (impact noise) in the back and with 004458.856 --> 004502.990 the momentum of his running, he crumples into the ground and tumbles and skids to a halt in the 004502.990 --> 004507.345 middle-- You're watching this, Fjord, as this happens. The other one up here at the top of the 004507.345 --> 004515.707 crow's nest, is going to take a shot at Nott, actually. You are within the 100-foot range. 004515.707 --> 004519.645 That's still a natural two, so it misses you. It splinters the wood right next to your foot as you 004519.645 --> 004523.708 step out of the way. Shards of wood go flying from the impact and the heavy bolt, about that long, is 004523.708 --> 004532.504 jammed at an angle into the planks before you. This one here and this one are both going to take 004532.504 --> 004539.834 heavy crossbow shots. One's at Caduceus and one's at Yasha, so the most visible. Against Caduceus-- 004539.834 --> 004544.786 oh, man, they're rolling terrible now. That's a six. 004544.786 --> 004546.854 Yeah. Yasha, however, does get hit with a 17, I believe. Right? 004552.246 --> 004553.356 Yasha takes eight points of piercing damage. 17 to hit, eight points reduced to four. 004557.246 --> 004601.376 This guy here has a hand crossbow. You are then in disadvantage range. He's going to take 004607.894 --> 004612.259 another shot at Caduceus with disadvantage. No, that's another six. 004612.259 --> 004618.625 Okay, that's the end of the crewmen there. That's the end of the combat round. These people, 004625.146 --> 004629.566 seeing all the fighting, are going to duck into their ship and hide. This team on this end, they 004629.566 --> 004634.007 all move out of the way but they're keeping an eye, over the side, of what's happening. Top of 004634.007 --> 004645.597 the combat round Beau and Jester. You appear, Beau, in the middle of this chaos. Flames behind 004645.597 --> 004651.028 you. You hear a thunderous blast, that echoes from behind. You glance over, you look forward, 004651.028 --> 004655.586 Jester's already running in the direction. You're on the rough and tumble rock and elements of 004655.586 --> 004700.464 cobblestone that have long worn off and not been replaced. In front of you, a little ways up ahead, 004700.464 --> 004705.335 you can see the tavern. 004705.335 --> 004706.528 The Bloated Cup. 004707.904 --> 004712.974 Okay, so you full run? 004715.449 --> 004721.670 In doing so, you make it all the way up. The street's there, and there's buildings on each 004739.199 --> 004745.568 side. To the front right of you--this perspective for you on this side is where you see the tavern. 004745.568 --> 004750.760 There are folks out there morning drinking, like, "Whoa." Watch you whiz past. You make your way up 004750.760 --> 004754.834 the street a little further and there are a few town guards that are looking over towards the inn, 004754.834 --> 004757.830 the sound, and all the craziness happening, and they notice you approaching and they all 004757.830 --> 004803.209 instinctively begin to go into a phalanx. They all go shoulder-to-shoulder and they're now blocking 004803.209 --> 004809.017 off the road from your continual passage. No weapons drawn, but in the midst of all this, they 004809.017 --> 004815.259 see crazy stuff happening and the one person darting at an inhuman speed away from it, and 004815.259 --> 004821.759 their instinct is to go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's figure this out." They're not aggressive yet. 004821.759 --> 004822.262 That's your turn? 004822.262 --> 004824.588 I'd say this happens at the very end of your turn. You're running, running, running, all of a 004826.699 --> 004830.604 sudden you stop right as they (clanking) right there in front of you. We'll pick that up next turn. 004830.604 --> 004832.061 That brings us to Avantika's go. All right. Oh, man. Okay. Avantika is going to leap down off 004848.797 --> 004851.110 the side of the ship. Acrobatics check. 004851.110 --> 004853.659 No, it's just difficult terrain. 004857.358 --> 004859.096 I will say, it would increase the DC for her landing, I'll give you that. But she did roll an 004902.349 --> 004903.555 18 on her acrobatics check. 004903.555 --> 004905.135 Leaping down, lands right in front of Nott. Skids down, lands a few inches back before coming 004912.647 --> 004917.125 to a stop. The ice grinds at the back of her foot and creates this little pile where the momentum 004917.125 --> 004922.218 eventually stops, holding her rapier in one hand and the dagger in the other, looking down at you, 004922.218 --> 004929.119 Nott, goes, "Ah, you should not have crossed me." She's going to take three strikes at you, two with 004929.206 --> 004935.730 her rapier and one with her dagger. The dagger, you can see now, is-- You've seen it a little bit 004935.730 --> 004941.409 in the battles. You were in dark spaces so it was hard to make a real, distinguishing visual of it, 004941.409 --> 004946.278 but out here in the open air, as she's clutching the dagger aggressively, there's a faint black 004946.278 --> 004952.808 energy faintly drifting off the edge of the blade. The attack with the rapier, first one-- natural 004952.808 --> 005000.060 four, no, it's going to miss you. Natural three. Both rapier shots, nothing. The dagger, however, 005000.060 --> 005001.801 that's going to be a 17 to hit. 005001.801 --> 005003.052 Okay. She's rolling real bad. As the two rapier shots, you dodge out of the way, but she 005011.559 --> 005017.749 uses that to feint forward and jam the blade up into the front of your stomach and rib cage area. 005017.749 --> 005025.221 That is going to be nine points of piercing damage and an additional eight points of necrotic damage. 005025.221 --> 005027.641 Okay. 005029.250 --> 005031.701 Yeah, it would halve both from the attack, so take eight points of damage. You manage to push 005037.330 --> 005042.208 away with your momentum, the blade doesn't sink quite as deep, and you, grabbing the wrist 005042.208 --> 005046.819 preventing it from really coming to the hilt in your chest, you pull away. That's going to end her 005046.819 --> 005054.979 turn. She shouts over her shoulder and goes, "Vera, we need friends!" Jester, your turn. 005054.979 --> 005056.632 You saw Beauregard dart up past you. 005059.472 --> 005103.518 If you look a little bit ahead of you, around each of the buildings that are right in 005108.360 --> 005112.912 front of you, there are alleys that curve around that would eventually meet in the road that you 005112.912 --> 005114.019 guys are currently running down. 005114.019 --> 005116.943 Yes, but you'd have to move up. You probably wouldn't be able to get to an alley to do it this 005125.102 --> 005130.441 turn. There are people around. There are folks that are watching all this chaos happen off in the distance. 005130.441 --> 005136.860 Okay, make a deception check. 005144.050 --> 005149.121 You're a little ways up. I'll roll a perception check for them, how about that? 005156.794 --> 005158.349 That's a cocked roll. The guards unfortunately do not hear it. They're not as 005204.821 --> 005208.809 perceptive and their focus is distracted between this, and they hear shouting, but they're not 005208.809 --> 005213.698 picking up the words. However, some of the folks nearby glance over at you and go, "Oh, shit, 005213.698 --> 005216.969 "really?" Finishes his drink real fast. 005216.969 --> 005218.108 "I've got to go see this!" They seem less worried about their lives and more like, "Oh, I 005223.607 --> 005225.816 "want to go see how this goes down." 005225.816 --> 005227.847 They're not around. In front of you there's one coming out of a building and you see a couple 005239.410 --> 005245.841 folks that are on the front porch entrance area of the tavern. 005245.841 --> 005249.738 It's up to you. What are you doing? 005252.239 --> 005259.558 Okay. Jester, you turn around and start heading back towards the group. It's a long run 005305.646 --> 005307.198 because you went 500 feet from the ship. 005307.198 --> 005310.658 You go for it. That finishes your go. Yasha's up. 005317.958 --> 005325.359 She's going to use her reaction to parry, which adds a plus two to her armor class. 005340.216 --> 005341.744 That misses. 005342.963 --> 005348.871 25 hits. 005350.822 --> 005354.841 14 points of damage to Avantika. As the blade carves through, she tries to parry it with 005405.017 --> 005410.238 the rapier, but it slips down and carves a slight bit off of her forearm before it gleans off, and 005410.238 --> 005413.220 you can see a little bit of red immediately exposed where the cloth was carved through, and a 005413.220 --> 005417.129 little bit of the skin and flesh removed with it. 005417.129 --> 005422.017 Okay, that's going to be (counting) 40. That's as far as she can get. 005429.820 --> 005431.768 Difficult terrain, yep. 005433.170 --> 005434.614 As an action you can angel of death. 005440.313 --> 005443.048 They're more for the surprise party factor than the actual flight thing. 005448.079 --> 005449.210 Okay, that finishes Yasha's go. Caduceus, you're up. 005452.662 --> 005506.359 There's the guards there. There's Avantika. Avantika does not have a reaction; she already 005511.200 --> 005512.850 used it to parry. 005512.850 --> 005521.979 Correct. 005523.839 --> 005525.350 I'll say for the purposes of keeping tabs on you, this will be your marker. 005551.756 --> 005553.923 No, it's your ability. As soon as you cast something, you lose your invisibility. 005611.188 --> 005614.230 Actually, let me check the wording on that, if it's different from the actual spell, because 005617.392 --> 005618.483 usually it's-- 005618.483 --> 005620.269 "Can magically turn invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack, make 005629.462 --> 005632.620 "a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw." You can cast a spell as long as it doesn't 005632.620 --> 005636.020 damage or attack somebody. 005636.020 --> 005638.342 Or force someone to make a saving throw. 005639.864 --> 005647.108 It would be 30 feet with this. 005651.821 --> 005652.619 (counting) 005700.101 --> 005704.022 You can go at an angle in front of Yasha. 005706.281 --> 005709.750 That ends your go, Caduceus. Fjord, you're up. Your friends are catching up behind you, 005714.391 --> 005717.537 there's a sleet storm slamming, there's guards swarming around your direction telling you to 005717.537 --> 005723.148 halt, and up ahead of you you watched a speedy Caleb grind into the ground. What are you doing? 005723.148 --> 005725.914 I wasn't sure if you had taken this spell. I prepared for it just in case. 005757.971 --> 005800.809 This is it! 005802.871 --> 005806.055 You'd be just on the edge of the ship there. 005813.010 --> 005816.883 With the dark speech that emanates from inside of Fjord's body, it echoes out like a 005833.496 --> 005839.567 weird, discordant harmony of several voices you've never heard. For those that are present. You guys 005839.567 --> 005840.935 are way the fuck away. 005840.935 --> 005843.427 There's the sound of reality cracking and you look up and watch where, in the center of the 005847.747 --> 005854.698 sky there, at the very edge of The Squalleater's deck, two large, meaty hands pull open this 005854.698 --> 005901.655 barrier between the realms, and stepping out you see this large, gorilla-like demon covered in fur 005901.655 --> 005906.568 and horns at the edge, these giant fists, with tusks that emerge from beneath this chin and these 005906.568 --> 005912.697 red, burning, coal-like eyes. As it steps out, it turns right towards Vera, whose eyes are wide, and 005912.697 --> 005919.895 (roars) in her face. You watch her hair get blown back a bit, spittle across her chin. That's your action. 005919.895 --> 005925.763 All right, you manage to Misty Step. 005932.012 --> 005936.854 Okay. This puts you-- 005938.498 --> 005940.149 Correct. You went 30 feet forward and you still have your movement. 005946.554 --> 005951.750 Okay, so you go heading towards Caleb. After shouting, "Avantika's not to be trusted" after 010000.214 --> 010011.793 summoning a fucking demon, I'm going to ask you to make a persuasion check with disadvantage. Because 010011.793 --> 010014.412 you just summoned a <i>fucking</i> demon. 010014.412 --> 010015.960 All right. Well, they seem to be more focused on what just appeared through the scar in 010027.167 --> 010032.073 reality you left. All right, so you charge past. You're coming upon the group of guards now that 010032.073 --> 010035.322 are around the rest of the crew of the Mistake, but they've forgotten about that crew at that 010035.322 --> 010040.688 point. They saw Caleb rush past. Two of them went over to figure out what the hell happened as he 010040.688 --> 010045.700 basically darted-- football fumbled off to the side. The others are turning and coming towards 010045.700 --> 010047.868 your direction, but it's not their turn yet. 010047.868 --> 010048.519 All right, that finishes your go, Fjord. It is now Bouldergut's go. 010050.832 --> 010053.136 You do, yes. 010054.361 --> 010103.111 19, right after Avantika. 010107.452 --> 010111.999 Oh, man. 010114.720 --> 010118.647 Correct. When you summon it, on each of its turns thereafter, you issue a verbal command to 010133.269 --> 010137.312 it, so you can keep issuing commands every turn. However, it doesn't go until its next initiative. 010137.312 --> 010142.156 All right. That's <i>real</i> interesting. 010142.156 --> 010143.029 So, Bouldergut's going to move. (counting) I'm going to make a saving throw for the now 010156.194 --> 010158.201 partially-damaged-- okay, yeah, that's fine. 010158.201 --> 010159.256 The plank is going to snap. Gets her about there, and is going do the dash up here. The next 010209.934 --> 010216.389 two guards who were now focused on Bouldergut coming forward, and they're not entirely certain 010216.389 --> 010222.035 what's happening. They're focused on the demon. There's weirdness from all sides. It seems the 010222.035 --> 010227.891 watch are not used to this chaos breaking this far in towards Darktow. Usually, the reef and the 010227.891 --> 010233.558 defenses they built around the reef are enough to keep things like this far from the island. That 010233.558 --> 010237.412 finishes Bouldergut's turn. That brings us to Nott and Vera, but Nott, you get to go first. 010237.412 --> 010244.437 (counting) You're next to Yasha with your movement. 010248.963 --> 010251.651 (counting) 25, 30. 010253.804 --> 010256.737 You are, and you still have your bonus action. 010259.816 --> 010307.726 Okay. 010326.118 --> 010330.261 What's the save? 010331.795 --> 010336.013 Natural five. 010339.315 --> 010341.027 She's very good at a few things, but she doesn't have the highest intelligence to get to 010344.835 --> 010346.087 that point. 010346.087 --> 010346.741 She's smart, but not that smart. 010348.341 --> 010349.662 I went to public school. 010351.752 --> 010352.776 It's a giant-- it looks like it once was a mast of a ship that's been whittled down into a greatclub. 010408.988 --> 010417.952 Okay. All right. Avantika glances over and (sigh). For a moment, you see a look of relief 010431.141 --> 010433.151 come over Avantika's face. 010433.151 --> 010434.074 All right. Is that your turn? 010435.127 --> 010436.410 You got it. Now, it's Vera's turn. Vera, seeing this happen-- Oh man. 010446.063 --> 010449.798 All right. Vera's going to glance off to the side-- Actually, she's going to try to move out of 010501.779 --> 010504.757 melee of this barlgura. 010504.757 --> 010506.407 Yeah. 010507.118 --> 010507.731 So, make a strike. 010508.891 --> 010517.114 Nine misses. 010517.871 --> 010519.338 As the giant demon swings outward, it impacts and deflects off the energy field of Mage 010524.844 --> 010529.672 Armor that pushes it off to the side. Vera steps back. The reach on that is five foot, right? For 010529.672 --> 010532.185 the attack? Just making sure. 010532.185 --> 010533.318 Okay, she pulls out of it and goes (harsh sigh). Looks down at Avantika, looks down at all 010538.090 --> 010540.390 the guards that are gathering as they're moving in. 010540.390 --> 010547.566 (music plays) 010547.566 --> 010550.264 Yeah, that does it. All right, she goes, after hearing what Avantika said, goes, "Everyone, 010603.807 --> 010611.121 "they have crossed Darktow! Take them to the Plank King!" You watch as she's saying these words, her 010611.121 --> 010615.373 hand sends this strange series of symbols through, and casts Mass Suggestion on the guards in the 010615.373 --> 010616.783 vicinity of 60 feet of her. 010616.783 --> 010618.656 Yes. 010620.118 --> 010621.597 Fail. Fail. Fail. It's working out great. It's like, two, seven, four, three. Ten, fail. 010634.815 --> 010636.749 Natural one. 010636.749 --> 010638.800 All of them failed. You watch as all of these guards have the confusion suddenly 010643.369 --> 010651.415 crystalizes, and all of them look towards your group and start shouting, "Stop them! They're thieves!" 010651.415 --> 010656.118 Vera, after casting that, is going to use the rest of her movement. (counting) Oh, god. 010712.382 --> 010714.957 I'll put her there, it's fine. All right, that ends Vera's turn. Caleb, for your turn, make 010721.235 --> 010725.507 a death save. It's the beginning of your round. I keep forgetting it's the beginning of your turn, 010725.507 --> 010727.496 in case you roll a natural 20. 010727.496 --> 010730.841 Cool. That's one success. 010732.232 --> 010732.848 All right. 010733.889 --> 010735.393 At the end of Vera's turn, this goes away. 010738.496 --> 010741.397 MARISHA and The sleet and stuff has now melted and dripped off the sides. These guards here-- 010751.964 --> 010755.402 (counting) 30 on each side, and they're both going to attempt to grapple Yasha. Go ahead and 010806.306 --> 010810.234 make an athletics check for her. She has advantage because she is raging. 010810.234 --> 010815.138 Yeah, one guy fails to grapple. Then the other guy's going to attempt to-- Make another 010818.843 --> 010822.239 check. She has to beat a 16. 010822.239 --> 010824.377 Yeah, they just can't-- they try and grab her, and she shrugs them off, no problem. These 010830.291 --> 010843.773 other guards here begin to swarm up to try and grab Nott. This one's going to move up and try and 010843.773 --> 010850.176 grab Yasha. This one here is going to-- He tries to move forward towards Yasha, and ends up 010850.176 --> 010856.522 chest-bumping space in the middle of the air, and confusedly is going to try and grapple whatever's 010856.522 --> 010902.888 there. He has disadvantage on that, so first, I'm going to do that with you. Rolled really well with 010902.888 --> 010906.924 disadvantage, natural 19 and a natural 17. Make an acrobatics or athletics check to see if he doesn't 010906.924 --> 010908.381 grapple you. 010908.381 --> 010911.355 Okay. 010922.440 --> 010923.897 (laughter) 010923.897 --> 010925.672 No, no, no! He tries to grab you, and he gets ahold of you, and you push him off, and he 010932.757 --> 010938.284 looks really confused. He grabbed <i>something</i> before he really knew what was happening, and is 010938.284 --> 010941.081 really confused. For a moment, he thinks it was a ghost. 010941.081 --> 010943.364 For the one that rushed up to try to grab Yasha again because the other guys failed, ooh, 010946.882 --> 010950.698 natural 18. So, roll for her. It's going to be a 20. 010950.698 --> 010953.296 She is currently grappled by this guy. He's now grabbed and is holding her in place. She's 010958.686 --> 011003.119 (grunting). The two other guys are going to try to dogpile in to try to stop her from moving. We have 011003.119 --> 011004.639 three attempting to grapple you, Nott. 011004.639 --> 011005.485 Yes. 011006.084 --> 011008.474 All right, so first guy-- 011013.185 --> 011015.052 You roll an acrobatics check against them. 011017.387 --> 011018.997 That's a success. Next guy, natural 20. 011022.024 --> 011023.430 That's 22. 011024.358 --> 011025.148 Oh, my god. All right, all right. So, he manages to actually grab-- The first one, you're 011034.300 --> 011038.870 just too slippery. "Oh, god!" You turn on the side. The other guy grabs you. Right as he 011038.870 --> 011044.367 squeezes, you just jump out of it, land on his arms, and then step off. The third one's going to 011044.367 --> 011048.790 try and grab you. That's a six. Go and roll. 011048.790 --> 011050.543 Okay, you still manage to slip away. None of them can grab you. You're too fast! Tiny goblin 011053.676 --> 011101.265 form! "Quick! Nab her!" You're jumping around, darting around, squeezing out of the way. No 011101.265 --> 011113.224 impact. All right, that finishes the guards' turn. Ipess is going to (counting) try to hide at the 011113.224 --> 011121.755 top of it. Ooh, natural 20. So, he's going to scoot up around the side, dart off the edge. He's 011121.755 --> 011130.230 going to make a shot at the barlgura, who has shown up. With advantage, that is going to be a 19 011130.230 --> 011131.424 to hit. What's its armor class? 011131.424 --> 011132.071 Okay. He does get sneak attack damage against it. 011134.254 --> 011136.102 That's an additional 2d6, so... 011138.640 --> 011140.865 14 points of piercing damage. Does it have any resistances? 011146.869 --> 011154.964 Damage immunity to poison. That's all? 011156.422 --> 011157.505 Got it. No immunities to non-magical weapons? 011200.881 --> 011204.729 Okay, just making sure. All right, yeah, so it takes full damage on that. Mark that. 011207.870 --> 011209.079 Yeah. That's going to end Ipess's turn. Now it's the crew's turn. This one's going to make a 011218.766 --> 011223.705 step back, trying to get out of range of the barlgura. It already used its reaction to do an 011223.705 --> 011229.324 attack. It's going to reload and fire with its crossbow against it. Ooh, that's going to be a 17 011229.324 --> 011230.959 to hit? 011230.959 --> 011231.739 All right. It suffers eight points of piercing damage. 011234.609 --> 011235.436 These guys here are going to fire down after reloading. They're now focusing on the giant 011242.066 --> 011244.405 demon. They're not focusing on you guys, so. 011244.405 --> 011245.204 They're turning like, "Oh, Jesus!" 011246.680 --> 011249.442 He's going to move over here, and attempt to fire at it from there. This one's going to stand 011253.120 --> 011257.511 where he is and reload. These guys are going to spin around and focus on this terrible creature. 011257.511 --> 011310.461 All right. This guy here is going to stay behind. That's (counting) six shots against the barlgura. 011310.461 --> 011312.345 So, all right. 18 to hit? 011316.995 --> 011317.833 One point of damage. 011319.971 --> 011320.826 Nine to hit. 011323.348 --> 011325.408 All right. Seven to hit. 011328.375 --> 011330.633 18 to hit. 011331.835 --> 011332.538 Nine points of damage. 011333.559 --> 011334.432 16 to hit. 011336.383 --> 011337.282 Seven points of damage. 011339.103 --> 011339.985 The last one is 14 to hit. 011342.713 --> 011346.536 That finishes the crew's go as they're all laying into this demon that appeared on there. You 011350.712 --> 011355.117 watch as (growl) as it turns back to yell, all of a sudden it gets another bolt in the chest and in 011355.117 --> 011358.835 the side. It's getting all of these bolts that are now sticking out of its body as it's raging 011358.835 --> 011405.301 angrily on the deck of the ship. You can see now there's a giant, burned U on the side. It wasn't 011405.301 --> 011410.670 around long enough to catch the ship on fire, but there is a dark scarring on the base of the deck 011410.670 --> 011415.603 there. All right. One more round, and it would've caught fire. 011415.603 --> 011421.805 (laughter) That would've been great! 011424.536 --> 011425.783 Oh, man. All right, that ends. Top of the round. All right, so, Beau. The guards are there 011433.150 --> 011437.198 in front of you right now. There's three of them shoulder to shoulder, and there's one of them that 011437.198 --> 011444.198 looks-- the one in the center is a little better-armored. They go, "Hey, Miss, Miss, where 011444.198 --> 011447.552 "are you going?" They're looking at you and both looking at what's over there. 011447.552 --> 011453.052 Make a persuasion check. 011502.086 --> 011504.563 No, because it's honest. 011508.715 --> 011512.484 There was nothing about that statement that was incorrect. 011515.120 --> 011518.867 You're not sure if he believes you, but he's not aggressive, if that makes sense. He goes, 011525.375 --> 011531.955 "Well, be that as it may, we need to figure out what's happening before we can have you running so 011531.955 --> 011533.777 "quickly with intent." 011533.777 --> 011538.358 "We'll send for him. Stay here," and the two other guards stay there, and hold the position and 011546.198 --> 011549.853 fill in the space. He turns around and starts making his way towards the Throne Roost. 011549.853 --> 011551.285 He goes, "Ah! I've got it," and he continues walking. 011553.483 --> 011555.704 We'll say that you've used an action at this point. You still have your bonus and your 011600.290 --> 011602.542 movement, if you want to use it. 011602.542 --> 011605.290 It's up to you. You can go along with it and stay there and wait for your friends, or anything 011612.645 --> 011617.156 else you want to try. They are not aggressive at this point; they're just holding the line. 011617.156 --> 011618.731 The tension in your body is rising up, and for a second, the muscles bulge and the veins 011639.198 --> 011643.329 begin to pop from the sheer amount of adrenaline that's in your system and your urge to charge 011643.329 --> 011649.934 through. You just breathe heavily as your entire form sinks into it. The two guards, you can see 011649.934 --> 011655.711 their tension, as their hands were going for a weapon, drop. They both go into a watching but 011655.711 --> 011659.880 waiting pose. That ends your go. 011700.106 --> 011701.882 It's now Avantika's turn. Avantika sees the guards shifting their allegiance under the effect 011709.200 --> 011715.517 of this Mass Suggestion spell. She's going to turn and attempt to go after Yasha. 011715.517 --> 011718.157 What? 011719.574 --> 011721.767 Yeah! 011722.570 --> 011725.026 Good. She's making three strikes against her, because she's the one closest to it. Yeah, 011739.476 --> 011746.704 she's not too hurt. She's not doing anything defensively. Or, you know what? 011746.704 --> 011751.071 No, Yasha's being held. As far as she knows, Yasha is doing okay, or the guards have her. Nott 011756.335 --> 011800.811 is the one that keeps darting around, so she's going to raise a hand and cast Eldritch Blast at Nott. 011800.811 --> 011804.079 Ooh, that's 24 to hit. 011810.645 --> 011812.738 You take three points of force damage. As you're jumping off, suddenly you get hit across 011821.688 --> 011826.407 the chin, but it's a glancing blow and your world goes a little dizzy for a second. The second one 011826.407 --> 011828.439 misses entirely. 011828.439 --> 011830.957 Yes. 011831.690 --> 011835.363 She didn't roll very good on the damage. 011837.757 --> 011842.066 Technically a grapple is an attack, yeah. She's going to use her movement to back up five, 011848.426 --> 011852.034 six, going towards this, backing up towards the ship. 011852.034 --> 011853.868 Correct. Instead of doing that, she stayed back to do that and is now looking up towards the 011857.257 --> 011902.905 demon that is raging onto the base of the ship. Seeing the guards have got this under the 011902.905 --> 011906.702 Suggestion spell, she seems to be backing off slightly. That's going to finish Avantika's go. 011906.702 --> 011908.175 Now it's the barlgura's turn. 011908.175 --> 011916.190 Oh-ho-ho! 011918.435 --> 011919.683 Because it can do that? 011929.813 --> 011930.478 Go for it. 011931.716 --> 011939.829 Yeah, that hits. Roll damage on that one. 011942.127 --> 011945.384 Okay, good to know. She does succeed on her constitution save with a natural 16. She does 011958.457 --> 012001.192 every time she takes damage to see if she can maintain her Mass Suggestion. 012001.192 --> 012002.065 That hits. Roll damage. 012010.336 --> 012016.936 All right. Natural 12, succeeds on the save. 012023.288 --> 012024.199 Her con bonus isn't that high, so it's just a straight roll on the d20. 012029.579 --> 012031.229 16 does hit. All three hit. 012032.905 --> 012036.655 That's a natural ten, just barely makes it. Does not drop concentration. But took some hits. 012048.678 --> 012054.739 Vera's looking a little roughed up and scared as shit. She runs down the stairs and turns around 012054.739 --> 012100.639 and sees this thing. (roars) It starts roughing her up. She's thrown against the back, is pummeled 012100.639 --> 012105.258 into the side of the ship and is trying desperately to look for a way to escape. 012105.258 --> 012106.289 That ends the barlgura's turn. I need you to take a charisma saving throw for it. 012108.794 --> 012111.463 Correct. 012124.908 --> 012129.325 Correct, and then it returns to its home plane. 012132.566 --> 012133.906 Well, no, you haven't lost concentration on it yet. It stays for the hour, but then once you 012151.713 --> 012154.817 lose concentration, roll a d6 to see how many more rounds it stays. 012154.817 --> 012158.561 Nope. 012159.579 --> 012200.983 No worries. That ends the barlgura's turn. Jester, you're up. 012203.157 --> 012204.083 You've ducked to the side. You've cast Disguise Self on yourself. 012206.622 --> 012209.438 Okay. 012210.278 --> 012213.171 Make a deception check. 012232.958 --> 012234.423 Okay. People in the nearby streets that are seeing this go like, "Are you serious? That crazy bitch!" 012249.712 --> 012252.280 A few people nearby take this and go, "Oh, oh!" and start going inside to avoid this. Other 012300.960 --> 012305.870 folks are getting angry and throwing their glasses on the ground and, "Oh! I knew one day-- Ugh!" 012305.870 --> 012310.588 They're pissed and going to grab their things and maybe start a militia against her. We don't know. 012310.588 --> 012314.093 You've rallied the corner. 012314.093 --> 012318.628 There are guards rushing towards the action that's happening behind you, and there are a few 012325.900 --> 012329.658 that are-- There's a bunch now making their way towards this intersection. 012329.658 --> 012333.714 Okay. You're up ahead and you hear this in the back, but you don't know it's Jester. You just 012337.666 --> 012341.321 hear a lot of shouting, so you're like, "Oh man, my deception worked, other people are yelling this!" 012341.321 --> 012343.958 Perfect. 012345.281 --> 012347.697 That finishes Jester's turn. It's Yasha's go. Yasha is currently grappled, but you can still 012351.332 --> 012355.502 make her actions. She has to use an action to break free if she wants to to move, but otherwise 012355.502 --> 012358.877 her movement is zero. But she has advantage because she's still raging. 012358.877 --> 012401.313 All right, make an athletics check with advantage. 012403.921 --> 012408.696 He got a six. 012409.707 --> 012410.486 So the guy managed to luckily grapple her last turn. She just flicks him off. He's like, 012414.929 --> 012417.088 "Ow!" So she's free of the grapple. 012417.088 --> 012425.450 Okay. 012426.421 --> 012431.670 All right, that ends Yasha's turn. Caduceus. 012438.907 --> 012441.329 Yes, you do. 012442.822 --> 012447.829 They all (gasp). 012452.286 --> 012457.240 You can Bless yourself. 012508.757 --> 012511.214 All right. That gives you d4. 012512.665 --> 012516.896 There you go. 012517.980 --> 012521.738 Okay, so that ends your turn. Or what else you doing? 012531.250 --> 012536.569 There's no attack. He looks startled, and his hands are forward to try and-- They're not 012541.758 --> 012545.677 weapon drawn to bludgeon you, but they're trying to keep you from going anywhere. 012545.677 --> 012548.413 From where you are there, 90 from there, about 110 feet from you. 012554.625 --> 012602.186 He's going to attempt to stop you. 012604.021 --> 012609.157 No. Unfortunately, you may not know this, they are currently magically compelled. 012615.189 --> 012618.507 You would not know that. 012619.529 --> 012622.978 As you're trying to tell him this and trying to scoot by, he like-- 012628.359 --> 012634.011 He heads you off of the pass and is saying, "Stay put." 012636.376 --> 012638.411 "Stay put." 012639.372 --> 012640.518 "He'll deal with it. Stay put!" 012641.501 --> 012644.576 The other way? 012648.323 --> 012652.116 Okay. There's other guards here, that are-- 012653.926 --> 012656.138 Okay. He's still trying to maneuver around. 012658.581 --> 012704.608 Fjord, you're up next. 012725.886 --> 012729.060 There you go. All right. Fjord, it's your go. 012733.256 --> 012735.284 Yeah, with the Misty Step and the movement you had. So you are 30 feet from him. 012740.313 --> 012743.581 As you do, you rush past some of the guards that are on the opposite side that were rushing 012747.279 --> 012752.720 towards you. There's, I believe at this point, four of them that were heading your direction, 012752.720 --> 012755.768 because there was the one that was going towards Caleb. So we'll say two of them you'll have to 012755.768 --> 012759.474 push past. They both are going to make attacks of opportunity on you. Just an attempt to grapple to stop. 012759.474 --> 012801.426 Make your acrobatics or athletics check to try and break free. 012805.478 --> 012811.368 That succeeds. They literally rolled a natural 14 plus two. 16 was the highest roll. The 012815.942 --> 012821.734 other rolled a two. You manage to shrug past. You push out of his grasp. He's like, "Hey, wait!" 012821.734 --> 012823.497 Well, no, you-- 012824.868 --> 012830.138 All right. So you come to consciousness on the ground. 012839.024 --> 012853.301 Well. Now it's Bouldergut's turn. Bouldergut's going to move up, shove past, and 012859.292 --> 012903.398 begin to take a giant club towards the barlgura. Down towards it. 012903.398 --> 012905.707 First hit is a 20 to hit? 012910.715 --> 012912.094 Other's an 18. 012913.244 --> 012914.822 Both hit, okay. First hit is 12 points of bludgeoning damage. 012919.741 --> 012921.033 The other one is 16 points of bludgeoning damage. 012924.196 --> 012925.533 Avantika see what? 012928.947 --> 012933.783 Yeah. It's really confusing. 012935.587 --> 012936.733 She's like, "No! What are you doing!" But she's used to Bouldergut not being the brightest. 012942.435 --> 012946.636 What's that? 012947.613 --> 012948.424 Oh, reckless. That's right, yeah. No! A four and a two. So both of those worked out fine. 012953.946 --> 012959.942 That's the end of Bouldergut's turn. Bouldergut's slamming onto this demon going, "Go to sleep! 012959.942 --> 013007.968 "Don't hurt my friends!" Finishing her go, it is now Nott's turn. 013007.968 --> 013010.099 Yes, and they're all-- hands on their weapons, trying to subdue you and grab you. 013014.449 --> 013023.129 They're now shouting, "Stop! Halt!" I say guards. They're all volunteer pirates of The Revelry that 013023.129 --> 013026.043 help keep watch on the shipyard here. 013026.043 --> 013027.324 No, the ones from the ship are further this way, and they were being brought by guards, but 013036.028 --> 013040.545 they've been left alone to focus on you guys. Yasha currently is stopped, and they're all very 013040.545 --> 013045.050 much in a "stay there" type position. They're in the process of subduing their quarry. 013045.050 --> 013047.378 Gotcha. 013048.714 --> 013056.943 You slip past and make your way up towards Fjord and Caleb. With your disengage, and your 013102.306 --> 013105.156 movement, and your action, you can make your way-- 013105.156 --> 013106.864 Yeah, 60 feet. From there, that would put you not quite to where they are, but it gets you 013110.442 --> 013113.606 up to where the other guards were that he rushed past, and just beyond them, because disengaged, 013113.606 --> 013122.488 they don't get any attacks of opportunity. All right, that ends your turn? Vera is looking not 013122.488 --> 013126.642 too great. Vera is going to-- 013133.822 --> 013136.016 Is going to cast Scorching Ray against the barlgura. She's going to attempt to take a step 013140.665 --> 013143.309 back up the stairs. Barlgura does get an attack of opportunity on her. 013143.309 --> 013145.342 15 just hits. <i>Just</i> hits. 013157.387 --> 013159.570 Ten points of damage, ugh. All right, makes it. Natural ten again. Doesn't break the spell. 013211.619 --> 013212.938 She's having good luck with those rolls. Takes it, climbs to the top, spins around, is 013216.941 --> 013224.392 going to Scorching Ray towards the barlgura. That's 3d20s against it. Okay, that's going to be 013224.392 --> 013228.976 20, 20, and 17. 013228.976 --> 013230.615 To hit. 013231.106 --> 013232.420 No. All right. Not a great damage roll. The balgura takes 18 points of fire damage. 013246.069 --> 013248.450 Caleb, you're up. 013256.192 --> 013257.018 You wake up, come to consciousness on the ground. Fjord is getting you up. You look over 013302.830 --> 013306.678 your shoulder, and you can see there's a whole shit ton of guards in the area that are subduing 013306.678 --> 013311.150 Yasha. Caduceus seems to have put his hands up. 013311.150 --> 013314.678 From the boat? From now, you'd be about 160 feet. 013320.371 --> 013324.230 Correct. 013325.387 --> 013330.392 Yeah. 013331.618 --> 013338.761 In your state-- where do you want to put it? 013350.725 --> 013352.878 You don't know. Where are you putting it? 013354.369 --> 013356.627 At the mast? All righty. As you wake up, you spin, fire. This ray streaks past. All the guards, 013406.638 --> 013414.061 who are calm at this point, see this happen, and watch the streak go by and detonate on the ship. 013414.061 --> 013418.091 The bright flash of light echoes against everybody's faces as the impact hits. Go ahead and 013418.091 --> 013419.430 roll damage. 013419.430 --> 013422.710 Yeah, totally, man. 013424.362 --> 013425.952 That'll go well. 013435.671 --> 013438.397 31, good rolls. 013447.778 --> 013448.891 Okay, so, Bouldergut, that's a fail. Bouldergut's looking rough. 013454.702 --> 013458.637 Just a strawberry scrape. All right, this guy. What's the DC on it? 013506.903 --> 013526.677 It should be 16, I think,. It's eight plus your proficiency plus that. 013531.823 --> 013533.033 All right, so he succeeds. He rolled a 17, so he takes-- 31, you said? So 15 points of damage 013542.429 --> 013548.634 to him. Oh, he's dead. He's fucking done. He took damage from the Fire Wall earlier. 013548.634 --> 013553.071 Yeah. That guy, he makes his save, but he dies too. 013600.185 --> 013602.271 This guy doesn't make his save; he's dead. 013607.689 --> 013611.269 Roll for the barlgura. 013615.128 --> 013617.517 Yeah, the barlgura is destroyed. Vera-- that's cocked. 013627.404 --> 013628.647 That is 13, does not succeed. Vera takes 31 damage. Vera's almost dead, is burned, incinerated 013638.914 --> 013640.020 on the ground, not moving. 013640.020 --> 013640.677 Concentration spell's lost. 013643.614 --> 013647.456 It doesn't work like that, unfortunately. But their compulsion's no longer there. 013651.419 --> 013654.482 Yeah. With that, the spell fades. Vera crumbles to the ground, barlgura's gone, giant 013710.247 --> 013717.803 explosion. The mast leans slightly to one side from the impact. This guy was out of the radius, actually. 013717.803 --> 013719.537 I'd say if he hit the mast-- I'd say it hit him, actually, yeah. 013722.072 --> 013724.302 Ipess has to make it as well. He fails, so he gets incinerated. 013728.619 --> 013733.670 Ipess does make it. I need you to make a wisdom saving throw, Caleb. 013742.726 --> 013744.260 No, the DC's real high on this one. 013745.974 --> 013756.613 As you go conscious, you watch as bodies go flying off the side and fall limp to the side of 013805.533 --> 013813.673 the dock, their bodies still smoldering but unmoving. You start flashing back to a very 013813.673 --> 013819.894 painful memory, and Caleb's eyes glaze over. You are currently stunned. 013819.894 --> 013822.454 Okay, that ends Caleb's turn. The guards that were calm are no longer calm. As they see you 013830.696 --> 013835.577 do this, the guards that were behind you charge in, and all grapple both of you. Are you resisting? 013835.577 --> 013836.753 No, all right. You are dogpiled and grappled. 013839.211 --> 013844.116 All right. Damn. 013859.712 --> 013904.014 Ipess looks around at the destroyed crew, saw Vera go down, and runs up to try and see how 013913.945 --> 013923.251 she's doing. The remaining crew, which is just the one here, and this one here. 013923.251 --> 013929.589 Bouldergut's still alive, barely. <i>Barely.</i> 013933.308 --> 013936.341 Currently the book's still in her hands. There was no variation in that. 013944.637 --> 013945.637 The book is still held there in her hand. Okay, that's going to end the crew's turn. Coming 013952.715 --> 013957.127 back to you, Beauregard, as you're just waiting. You keep waiting? 013957.537 --> 014002.694 "Don't do anything funny." They turn around and start walking with you. 014018.753 --> 014021.466 They're (grunting), trying to keep up a bit. 014027.797 --> 014029.547 Avantika takes a quick glance at the scenario, and opens the hatch and charges inside 014048.981 --> 014051.397 of her ship. 014051.397 --> 014053.256 At this point, unless anyone's going to resist, combat comes to an end and we are now at a 014109.109 --> 014117.035 role playing point. At that moment, we'll take a break. Unless you were doing anything? 014117.035 --> 014118.036 We'll take a break in a second, then. 014123.878 --> 014125.163 Because when it gets to Nott's turn-- 014127.022 --> 014129.117 Okay. If that's the case, there are four guards now. No, because now two of them have 014136.149 --> 014139.514 changed direction to go towards you and help subdue you guys. There's two after you now. 014139.514 --> 014143.271 They're both going to attempt to grapple you and stop you. Make two acrobatics checks. 014143.271 --> 014147.998 Ten on the first one. 014150.096 --> 014151.595 Both fail, actually. 014153.008 --> 014154.688 Yeah, that was a 12 and an 18. 014156.188 --> 014159.181 This was as you were charging through there, and on their turn they moved up to you. 014202.250 --> 014204.696 Your movement's zero, you can't escape. We'll say that happened on their turn, so on the 014213.515 --> 014216.095 beginning of your turn, you're grappled. You can attempt to break free if you want to. 014216.095 --> 014217.789 Actually, that's an interesting point. Let me pull up my new, fancy Player's Handbook. 014222.053 --> 014223.007 Unintentional commercial, but these are so awesome. 014234.149 --> 014237.810 I think they're brick-and-mortar only, so you've got to go to actual game stores. 014240.330 --> 014248.125 It doesn't say. I'll say make a check and we'll see if it's high enough for each of them. 014309.855 --> 014313.087 No. They hold tight, you can't move. Your movement's zero. They're both clutching you there 014320.433 --> 014322.136 on the side. 014322.136 --> 014325.072 Okay. With the chaos now coming to a stop, and Nott prevented from escaping, though that 014330.214 --> 014333.114 would have been a fun chase sequence, now we'll go to a break. 014333.114 --> 014339.435 Man, that was really intense. 014344.275 --> 014345.733 Oh, there was a few things there that went differently than I expected! 014349.774 --> 014354.484 Before we go to the break, we have our fantastic giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood, 014402.549 --> 014406.705 who are giving away this leather-inset zebrawood dice tray. 014406.705 --> 014411.848 To join the contest, you have to go and jump over to the Critical Role Twitch chat, that's at 014417.224 --> 014427.386 twitch.tv/criticalrole, during the break, and enter the keyword "fire." Only enter it once, more 014427.386 --> 014431.088 than once and you'll be disqualified. Once again, unfortunately, only the US and Canada, excluding 014431.088 --> 014434.744 Quebec. We'll have a winner for you at the end of the break. See you guys then. 014434.744 --> 014437.514 Hello, everyone, and welcome back. Before we go in, we have our winner of our fantastic 020045.551 --> 020051.764 Wyrmwood dice tray, zebrawood dice tray. The winner is WonderfulMouse. Congratulations, 020051.764 --> 020055.515 WonderfulMouse! We'll get that sent to you ASAP. 020055.515 --> 020057.866 Diving back in. As the rest of you stand there amongst the shipyard docks, subdued by the 020107.455 --> 020113.953 harbor watch, The Revelry watch there. More gather, and more gather, I'd say about half the 020113.953 --> 020118.161 watch of this city, the volunteer mercenaries that take their shifts to keep their eye on their 020118.161 --> 020123.810 island, little haven there, all flood the docks to see what the hell just went down. You look up and 020123.810 --> 020129.432 see the blackened, charred sails of the ship, treated against weathering, but still darkened 020129.432 --> 020135.486 from the blast of the fireball, the wood itself darkened and splintered in places. You can see 020135.486 --> 020143.370 that giant, burned U that marks the deck. Everything is held in place. You're making your 020143.370 --> 020149.010 way to the guards. What are you doing, Jester? You see Beau being led up by the guards towards the 020149.010 --> 020150.426 Throne Roost. 020150.426 --> 020158.523 Oh yeah, you saw and heard the distant (explosion). 020203.080 --> 020204.093 Okay. The guards have now pulled you all to your feet, and have begun to apply manacles to 020225.974 --> 020234.101 your hands. Not anything too aggressive, but for the purpose of safety and to maintain the order 020234.101 --> 020241.832 within this community, they're particular and careful. They also go onto the deck, and you see 020241.832 --> 020250.484 them beginning to collect the bodies of those that were killed. Bouldergut is inconsolable and 020250.484 --> 020258.556 furious, and it takes a few guards to get her to calm down. Avantika is having a conversation with 020258.556 --> 020307.313 a couple of the guards. You guys are being pulled away from the docks, towards the city. As you are 020307.313 --> 020313.896 brought towards the edge of it, one of the guards, adorned a little better than the rest, have a 020313.896 --> 020322.479 brief discussion. You overhear one of them say, "Hold tight, apparently someone's going to get the 020322.503 --> 020330.729 "Plank King." While you guys are all waiting, and you're going to convene with the rest of your troupe-- 020330.729 --> 020332.966 But go and find the vicinity. 020334.519 --> 020335.608 There are many looky-loos on the edges of the shipyards here. The docks make up probably a 020340.922 --> 020347.193 good third of Darktow. Before you actually get the edge of the cliff where the city itself is built 020347.193 --> 020352.661 on different areas and platforms, and the streets all rise at a perpetual grade, as it is embedded 020352.661 --> 020358.056 in the side of the cliff. There are folks who are looking over to see what happened. Usually this 020358.056 --> 020403.143 kind of stuff does not go down within the city. You can see that people are excited, and worried, 020403.143 --> 020407.069 and making up their own stories, and what they saw. One of them is like, "It was crazy! A demon 020407.069 --> 020413.662 "fell from the sky and slammed into the boat and it was intense!" The rumors are going crazy. 020413.662 --> 020415.398 That's a 7th-level spell, Summon Gwar Concert. 020419.917 --> 020424.742 You can probably all-- they do round you up. However, as soon as you begin to make any physical 020444.340 --> 020445.877 action towards spellcasting-- 020445.877 --> 020446.848 It's only verbal? 020447.800 --> 020450.988 You tell them you're going to cast a spell? 020453.394 --> 020456.470 "No spellcasting." 020457.968 --> 020500.360 "Don't want any funny stuff." 020502.281 --> 020504.272 They have, after manacling, taken your weapons. The individuals are carrying them at 020510.728 --> 020512.946 their side. Not yours. They couldn't find yours. 020512.946 --> 020514.752 They have your crossbow, and they've taken your shield and your staff. 020523.215 --> 020529.088 There is a small perimeter being held, but you could get probably within 20, 25 feet or so of them. 020539.680 --> 020544.260 Okay. 020545.488 --> 020547.970 Make a performance check to see how subtly you can-- no, this would be deception. Make a deception. 020556.217 --> 020557.884 As you begin to subtly try and sneak your verbal components of your spell into the 020614.703 --> 020620.698 discussion, one of the guards goes "Hey! Sorry, we're making sure there's no casting this close to 020620.698 --> 020623.549 "it, if you don't mind." 020623.549 --> 020627.903 "It's best not to get involved. Terribly sorry about that." 020632.601 --> 020635.095 Nah, that's it. 020636.730 --> 020639.700 He's telling everyone, "Please, hold tight. Don't worry. We're taking care of it." 020648.475 --> 020654.325 Anyway, about 30 or so minutes pass for the rest of you. As make your way up the steps now, 020701.265 --> 020708.605 trying to jaunt, you manage to catch up to the armored fellow, who now acts as the tip of the 020708.605 --> 020713.430 spear, essentially. Now you're flanked and to the front, although the flanking has to shift as the 020713.430 --> 020718.732 space for the steps ascending to the Throne Roost get only wide for one person at a time. You are 020718.732 --> 020726.579 being held at that point. You make your way up to the Throne Roost, to the shelf of stone. There you 020726.651 --> 020732.858 see, standing at the edge, is the Plank King himself, blackened curls still dangling around his 020732.946 --> 020738.803 massive goliath head, his long coat billowing slightly with the bit of wind that's whipping 020738.803 --> 020748.462 around the side of the cliff face. The morning fog is burning off of the nearby reefs, and you can 020748.462 --> 020756.146 see a little bit further out. The sky itself is still dull gray. Looks over and goes, "That was 020756.146 --> 020804.170 "quite the display, wouldn't you say?" The guard goes, "Right, sir. One of them, we found at least 020804.170 --> 020809.907 "someone running from the bit who says they have information for you." He goes, "Oh yeah, no, I 020809.907 --> 020812.411 "recognize this one. Step forward." 020812.411 --> 020814.279 "So what's all this?" 020818.163 --> 020823.299 "If you don't mind, tell me what's going on." 020826.606 --> 020832.047 He flips through the pages. "This is gibberish." 020839.186 --> 020844.297 He glances through the paperwork, looks at you giving him this sly grin, and goes, "You, 020910.101 --> 020920.372 "newcomer into these waters, spent less than a day amongst our people and have already attacked and 020920.372 --> 020922.222 "stolen from one of our own, as well." 020922.222 --> 020925.074 "Well, we'll see what she has to say to defend herself, as well. Hang tight with me here, 020932.782 --> 020938.318 "with these men. The rest of you, get the rest of your guard. Bring her friends, and bring Avantika 020938.318 --> 020942.269 "and who else had survived that massacre up here to the roost." 020942.269 --> 020947.328 "I don't trust anyone, and I trust more those that I've mistrusted for years than those 020952.300 --> 021000.935 "I've only come to mistrust and know right now. So we'll see where it all lies. Be patient. If what 021000.935 --> 021004.601 "you say is true, then we've got all time in the day." 021004.601 --> 021006.116 "I don't read a fucking piece of this, but I've got a few friends who are more of a 021010.405 --> 021012.730 "page-turning type." 021012.730 --> 021016.701 "Because I wanted to see if you'd actually do something. Remember, we don't turn on pirates here." 021023.191 --> 021028.386 "If you're right, then I'll judge you based on the fact that you broke our law as soon as you 021032.419 --> 021038.935 "got here, and I'll weigh it versus how positive this tells me. There's not enough, well, maybe you 021038.935 --> 021042.931 "and Avantika will find yourselves out there on a pike of warning." 021042.931 --> 021046.797 Make a deception check. 021059.315 --> 021101.848 SAM and Okay. He nods a bit. 021114.331 --> 021118.105 "So's this one." He snaps his fingers, and you see a cloaked figure step out of the shadows, 021132.747 --> 021135.736 the same cloak that passed you on the stairs the night before. 021135.736 --> 021136.965 It's Jamedi, hood pulled back. 021140.206 --> 021142.736 At which point, the Plank King steps up towards you, now looming over you, a good two and 021150.815 --> 021157.594 a half feet of height on you. This imposing presence, wide like a mountain, glancing down at 021157.594 --> 021202.400 you with a grin. You can smell his early morning breath of rotting teeth and whatever he had the 021202.400 --> 021212.542 night before pulsing from his grin. He goes, "I have to say, for someone so small, you've got some 021212.542 --> 021214.075 "serious balls." 021215.810 --> 021218.760 "And if you survive, I'm sure it won't be the last. All right. Let's go see your friends." 021225.441 --> 021235.407 "If this is right, let's hope you didn't blow up too much of <i>her</i> boat; it'll be yours." 021243.220 --> 021245.867 "<i>If</i> it's enough." 021249.743 --> 021255.470 The guards now turn and spin you around and push you back down the stairs as the Plank King 021258.953 --> 021305.534 follows behind, Jamedi keeping a close watch. He goes and shouts something off to the side. He 021305.534 --> 021313.034 goes, "Solon! I'm going to need your brain for this one. Come on." You hear a voice go, "All 021313.034 --> 021314.268 "right, I'm coming." 021314.268 --> 021316.669 LIAM and Solon. S-O-L-O-N. Coming around the corner, you see a human man, probably in his late 50s, 021325.561 --> 021335.159 early 60s. Bit of an unkept puff of a chin goatee, his hair thinning in this big widow's peak, gray 021335.159 --> 021346.260 to white. These big spectacles around his eyes, and this tattered, thin mustache that's attempted 021346.260 --> 021352.187 to be curled into a handlebar, but it seems to have split in places and is not very well kept. He 021352.187 --> 021357.976 has this big, green cloak that's wrapped around his shoulders that is so much material and 021357.976 --> 021403.332 billowing so widely, it makes his head comparatively look much smaller. He's clutching a 021403.332 --> 021408.330 bag, and he's getting his stuff. "Wait here, I'm getting my stuff. Ugh!" They keep walking, and 021408.330 --> 021413.227 eventually you see him trying to catch up from behind. (panting) You take it this was probably 021413.227 --> 021416.568 what the Plank King was referring to as his bookish friend. 021416.568 --> 021417.939 As you guys are all patiently waiting here, looking amongst yourselves, is there anything you 021428.372 --> 021437.080 wish to do, or are you succumbing to the hope that Jester, Beauregard, and/or possibly the Plank King 021437.080 --> 021441.645 comes to situate this? Eventually, you see Avantika brought up from the ship in manacles, as well. 021441.645 --> 021446.017 No, they shut that down. 021448.117 --> 021450.743 It's not quite long enough to be a short rest. 021455.196 --> 021456.202 Actually, you know what? No, it's about an hour of short rest. I give that to you. 021501.572 --> 021502.620 For the travel of Beau to the front, and the rest of the guard to get there; for the Plank King 021504.996 --> 021507.751 conversation; for him to descend the Throne Roost to make his way through the city to the docks; 021507.751 --> 021508.986 yeah, that's over an hour. 021508.986 --> 021514.240 Okay. As Frumpkin appears on the shoulder, one of the watch goes, "Oh, where'd you come from, 021523.965 --> 021528.645 "little one? Didn't even see you come in." Begins scritching Frumpkin. 021528.645 --> 021532.008 Doesn't even talk to you. Just looks at Frumpkin. "Who's a cute little kitty? We don't get 021535.698 --> 021539.688 "cats much on this island. It's good to see one. Wonder what ship you came aboard?" 021539.688 --> 021543.471 (laughter) 021543.471 --> 021545.702 Eventually, as the crowd begins to part, you see a number of the guard, a few of the bodyguards 021555.647 --> 021600.244 that you had seen previously sitting amongst the shadows of the Throne Roost when you first arrived 021600.244 --> 021608.387 the night before. You guys came roaring into this town; you definitely did. There you see Beauregard 021608.387 --> 021615.844 being flanked by three guards, one better-armored than the others, and then there, stepping behind 021615.844 --> 021627.772 that, the looming figure of the Plank King. He approaches. "So not here but 24 hours and you've 021627.772 --> 021636.018 "already made a mess of our little home, have you? I could see the flames from my Roost. My crow's 021636.018 --> 021642.639 "men tell me they spotted you walking aboard the Squalleater and assault Avantika, one of our own. 021642.639 --> 021651.481 "Apparently a few of you fleeing into the city. You know I have my misgivings about trusting anyone, 021651.481 --> 021657.484 "but I'm far more likely to toss in with those that I've mistrusted long enough to at least know where 021657.484 --> 021708.496 "they stand. I don't know a fucking bit about all of you. So my other friend--" and he points 021708.496 --> 021716.281 towards Jamedi, who's now in the back, and the rest of you see, "-- says that you've all come in 021716.440 --> 021722.944 "with her lot naught but maybe two weeks back, and that not most of you have much of an experience on 021722.944 --> 021732.790 "the sea, naught but one. The rest of you still haven't quite found your legs on the waters. I'm 021732.790 --> 021742.660 "going to ask you right now, what brought you out there, to mucking with the pirates' deals? Speak up!" 021743.557 --> 021751.428 He reaches back in his pocket and goes, "Oh, right. Here," and gives it to Solon, who goes, 021813.057 --> 021819.760 "Oh, all right. This is not a language I really know--" 021819.760 --> 021821.300 "Oh, yeah." 021822.111 --> 021823.664 He takes it and pulls it out, looks at it. "Oh, fuck me, this is--" 021827.491 --> 021829.942 "Sir, with all due respect, it's going to take me a long while to do this. This is elaborate." 021836.448 --> 021839.457 The Plank King goes, "Shh." 021846.866 --> 021849.369 "You said there's some special parts here, of looking to overturn me or something? What pages 021855.366 --> 021857.235 "are that at?" 021857.235 --> 021902.639 Solon goes, "Oh! I'd very much like to have a conversation with you." 021910.009 --> 021915.646 You point out the space where that was. 021932.473 --> 021934.231 Thumbs through, and he goes-- 021935.672 --> 021936.426 "Okay. O great king, give me a bit of time with this, if you don't mind?" He looks around. 021945.068 --> 021950.701 Everyone's looking at him. At this moment he glances around and sees the dozens and dozens of 021950.701 --> 021953.931 eyes locked on him, and he starts getting a little nervous. You see a little sweat drop on his 021953.931 --> 021958.302 forehead, and he adjusts his glasses again. They're starting to fog a bit. He goes, (clears 021958.302 --> 022002.439 throat), plops down, and starts going through, and pulls out paper and a quill. He sets up in the 022002.439 --> 022007.086 middle of the dock area and starts going through and point-by-point deciphering and translating 022007.086 --> 022010.754 each part of the cipher over to one of his empty pages. 022010.754 --> 022013.847 "That we do." 022015.796 --> 022023.088 "Oh, we're standing right here." 022029.267 --> 022031.088 "You still haven't answered my question. What brought you to these waters? Why'd you throw 022037.177 --> 022041.335 "in with her lot?" You see now, they're bringing Avantika forward with the rest of you. 022041.335 --> 022050.924 "Where does your allegiance lie?" 022129.678 --> 022138.921 His eyes narrow. Make a deception check. I'll say with advantage because you did drop the 022150.433 --> 022156.973 Cobalt Soul. In particular with the Plank King, that has meaning. 022156.973 --> 022159.039 Insight check. 022201.193 --> 022202.676 Yes, for you. 022204.202 --> 022207.575 The Plank King nods and goes-- 022211.846 --> 022214.070 Yeah, you barely see through. There's a hint of truth, and there's a hint of not so true. It's 022224.288 --> 022225.848 a half-truth. 022225.848 --> 022229.246 The Plank King nods and goes, "Ah, the Archives. I've had some dealings." 022237.926 --> 022241.635 "Not much of a reader. But your folk have done good work for our interests in the past. So! 022254.316 --> 022300.992 "It's the woman of the hour. What have you to say about yourself when these strangers have come 022300.992 --> 022305.829 "waltzing into our little haven and causing all sorts of ruckus. Murdering your crew and making 022305.829 --> 022317.310 "these claims against you. Known you for years." Avantika, hand behind in shackles goes, "Well." 022317.310 --> 022325.714 Her face, you can see bits where dirt, sweat lines have made their way across and down the sides of 022325.714 --> 022332.300 her chin and jaw. Looking intently at the rest of you with a forced smile through her teeth, there 022332.307 --> 022340.081 is a look of murderous rage and loss in her eyes, as you have murdered a majority of her crew. She 022340.136 --> 022351.280 goes, "Well, I can guarantee that I kept no journal. They came to me at sea with discussion of 022351.280 --> 022400.382 "perhaps coming and joining my crew, looking for means of aid and gold. They began to talk of this 022400.382 --> 022413.421 "strange entity, this Uk'otoa. Well, I followed suit. I wanted to make for some kind of alliance. 022413.421 --> 022420.152 "I found particular interest with one of their individuals." She looks over towards Fjord, "But 022420.152 --> 022426.917 "it seems such a romance was merely just another way to try and toss me to the proverbial wolves, 022426.917 --> 022435.606 "or merrow if it will. They've now killed my crew. They've taken a number of my things, damaged my 022435.606 --> 022444.136 "ship, and they're trying to smear my name. One who has walked alongside you and all of you fine, fine 022444.136 --> 022451.558 "folks for the past ten years! Even using the memory of Vandren against me." You hear a few 022451.558 --> 022501.794 voices go like, (murmuring) "Vandren." "Vandren raised this one and he sabotaged his ship. Blew it 022501.794 --> 022508.294 "asunder in the middle of the ocean. That was the last he was seen. He's already killed one of our 022508.294 --> 022512.508 "own. Is this untrue?" 022512.508 --> 022514.849 Yeah. 022515.545 --> 022520.697 Someone goes, "Shh!" All eyes are on you. 022524.961 --> 022530.006 Make a persuasion check. 022551.235 --> 022552.665 The Plank King gives you this very severe look. His eyes narrowed and glancing you up and 022609.056 --> 022617.400 down, almost piercing you with but a glance. He raises his hand with a grin and goes, "Oh. What's 022617.400 --> 022619.683 "necessary for such a thing?" 022619.683 --> 022621.675 "Be my guest." Avantika is like, "What is--" 022655.155 --> 022656.632 She's manacled and being held by two guards from behind. It's auto-hit. 022703.926 --> 022704.995 Do you have a ki point left? 022708.066 --> 022713.536 All right. What's the DC on that? 022717.088 --> 022723.942 Yeah, whatever your DC is for all of your monk stuff. 022726.475 --> 022729.292 LIAM, SAM, and Okay. It's a wisdom save. No. That's a natural eight plus four. 12. So all these 022745.576 --> 022750.177 different hits and pressure points are hit, like under the chin, that area. Another to the sternum 022750.177 --> 022755.639 and another that clocks the temple. And Avantika just, "Ugh!" (heavy breathing) 022755.639 --> 022802.326 Intimidation checks? Oh, charisma checks! Yeah, persuasion, everything else. That's right, yeah. 022805.855 --> 022808.773 She's like "Ugh!" 022814.384 --> 022819.197 The Plank King steps forward. "Avantika, is what they're saying true?" She goes, (frustrated 022829.117 --> 022841.508 grunt) Glances aside. Doesn't respond. He leans forward closer. "Tell me." 022841.508 --> 022844.691 "Is what they're saying true? Is that book containing passages where you're looking to take 022851.295 --> 022902.210 "this island for yourself?" Her eyes look away. She just looks down at the rest of the dock. He leans 022902.210 --> 022908.075 in real close, pushing his forehead almost to hers. "Look me in the eye, woman." 022908.075 --> 022911.210 She just doesn't meet his gaze. "Hmm. By the power of The Revelry that surrounds me, let this 022935.239 --> 022947.405 "be a lesson to those who would work against the words we swore to each other on this land. May 022947.405 --> 022956.651 "your memory be besmirched for the few days it's recalled." He reaches forward and grabs Avantika 022956.651 --> 023000.819 by the throat and lifts her up and she's fighting against it. He lifts her and looks at her. "I hope 023000.819 --> 023007.738 "your sea god, whatever it is, is very merciful on the other side." (cracking) He breaks her neck 023007.738 --> 023017.387 with one hand. Her body goes limp in his grasp and he throws it to the docks. "Don't worry about the 023017.387 --> 023026.731 "cipher." Solon goes, "It's actually quite interesting. I'd like to continue." "Fine." 023026.731 --> 023029.937 "And it's really well done! I'm honestly very taken aback by it. Your penmanship is quite 023034.343 --> 023035.422 "good as well." 023035.422 --> 023036.066 "Oh, certainly!" He goes and starts taking it. At this point, the Plank King goes, "Take her 023045.667 --> 023058.383 "up top. She'll be the next on the pike. As for the rest of you, you've pulled out a conspiracy, I'll 023058.383 --> 023104.869 "give you that. You've also snuck your way into The Revelry under false pretenses. You've broken our 023104.869 --> 023117.534 "laws within but a day of being presented with them, in multiple ways. That's a serious offense. 023117.534 --> 023134.516 "So hear my judgment upon these folk. You are hereby banished from Darktow. Take the remnants of 023134.516 --> 023142.522 "the Squalleater as your own. Take whatever--" He looks over towards the rest of the crew you hired, 023142.522 --> 023144.586 who are like (panicked panting). 023144.586 --> 023146.751 They have had a terrible few weeks here! Except for Orly, who's sitting there, smoking a 023152.595 --> 023156.677 pipe, and his one eye goes. 023156.677 --> 023158.034 "Take the ship you've thereby damaged. Limp your way beyond the reefs. We're going to burn the 023209.771 --> 023217.416 "colors of that ship. Should you ever return to the outskirts of the Dragshallow, we won't hesitate 023217.416 --> 023221.742 "but sink you to the depths below." 023221.742 --> 023226.405 "Unshackle them. This stands immediately. I hope you have enough supplies in that boat to last 023233.652 --> 023235.535 "you the rest of the journey." 023235.535 --> 023237.011 "Good. Tell the Archives that the Plank King sends his regards." 023250.238 --> 023254.211 "Now fucking go!" 023256.426 --> 023300.218 Okay. You have to dive into the water to do so. 023306.677 --> 023307.871 So, you jump into the water. Make an investigation-- No, this'll be a perception check 023313.657 --> 023315.883 with disa-fucking-vantage. 023315.883 --> 023317.762 Yeah. 023318.474 --> 023320.302 You spend the next five or so minutes scrounging through silt and muck and barnacles and 023352.561 --> 023359.776 gathered bits of kelp and various other underwater plant life that has rooted itself among the rocks 023359.776 --> 023405.672 here. You've scraped your fingers, they're bleeding from digging through. You find a cluster 023405.672 --> 023410.688 of these gems that you dropped and you climb up out of the freezing water and find one of the 023410.688 --> 023415.731 nearby ladders and come up. Looking at your quarry, it is a bunch of rocks. 023415.731 --> 023419.234 Oh you don't see Jester. You just see an old prospector come up. 023421.277 --> 023422.062 You guys are ushered to the Squalleater. Your crew is ushered to the Squalleater. 023432.725 --> 023435.397 The Mistake is still in repairs and at this point has been left behind. 023439.248 --> 023442.007 The remained of them, yes. Bouldergut is heavily manacled and is currently guarded by seven 023453.651 --> 023454.871 different guards. 023454.871 --> 023456.017 All right. As you guys get on the ship with your crew, the ship is damaged, the sails are 023521.650 --> 023527.563 damaged, one of the masts is damaged. It's going to need some repairs for it to be fully 023527.563 --> 023530.035 functional. But you have to leave now. 023530.035 --> 023532.132 You take your positions at the ship, pull up the anchor, and make your way limping through the 023539.508 --> 023547.134 channel of Dragshallow Reef, back out towards the Swavain Islands, the Lucidian Ocean. As you slowly 023547.134 --> 023552.001 make your way with what little bit of wind you can pick up to bring you out there-- some of the sails 023552.001 --> 023559.400 are still working, so you're not fully damaged, but you're not optimal. There are a series of 023559.400 --> 023610.106 these-- what are referred to as the War Posts that are the clusters of driftwood and these towers 023610.106 --> 023613.742 that are set up along the reef and on top of the various reefs that are shallow or breach the 023613.742 --> 023621.860 actual surface that have cannons attached, that have flares set up and beacons that can be lit to 023621.860 --> 023627.299 alert Darktow. You get a better look this time of the system they have to defend this island from 023627.299 --> 023635.730 the Clovis Concord and anybody else that would look to make their way via ship to this island. 023635.730 --> 023641.568 You can see them at the ready, keeping a very close eye on your exit as you slowly walk of shame 023641.568 --> 023650.640 yourselves out of the purview of the Plank King and to a very carefully earned freedom. 023650.640 --> 023656.133 Okay. 023720.819 --> 023727.299 Make a general persuasion check for me. Just a persuasion check. 023734.587 --> 023735.883 Okay, you do. A number of the crew that you hired, some of them look like they're a little 023742.360 --> 023748.146 scarred from the experience, but you managed to calm them down. They seem very thankful that 023748.306 --> 023751.935 you've pulled them-- you brought them into this mess, but you pulled them out of it and there's 023751.935 --> 023759.557 something to that. Some of them begin to get back to work, begin to repair some of the aspects of 023759.557 --> 023805.099 the ship. Man. 023805.099 --> 023807.985 There are a few places, but for the most part-- and it's only the one mast. You still have 023820.357 --> 023825.356 enough sails because it's a three-mast ship. You can still coast the winds, but it's not going to 023825.356 --> 023830.733 be optimal speed. You'll have to get back to some sort of a port to get the rest of the sails 023830.733 --> 023836.791 repaired because you don't have replacement sails. The downside of the Fireball. The Fireball and 023836.791 --> 023841.206 the-- actually. It was a 20-foot tall Wall of Fire. 023841.206 --> 023843.122 It was. 023844.363 --> 023846.520 Yeah, there's a lot of sail-- you have-- 023848.039 --> 023852.821 I know, but that's a very intense-- 023854.699 --> 023855.771 I would say comparatively, you're limping on one full mast of functionality, and the rest of 023902.464 --> 023904.199 the sails are partially damaged. 023904.199 --> 023906.414 Just so you know-- 023921.994 --> 023924.309 Just so you know, this ship travels on an average pace of around 48 miles a day. Right now 023931.048 --> 023935.672 with the damage the sails have sustained, you're close to 20. You're less than half speed on the 023935.672 --> 023943.206 ship with the damage it's sustained at the sails. It's going to take you a while to get anywhere. 023943.206 --> 023944.699 But you have it. 023944.699 --> 023947.617 They're beyond Mending. 023948.716 --> 023949.409 Mending can do little tears and things. 023951.178 --> 023954.379 For the ones that are damaged, the sails are mostly destroyed. They caught fire and burned. 023959.749 --> 024008.246 Doesn't quite work that way, and it's temporary. It's more-- 024029.956 --> 024033.850 To be fair, I think that worked in your favor. If tonight has proved anything, if the end 024037.175 --> 024040.317 of the last campaign has proved anything, Counterspell's always a good choice. 024040.317 --> 024043.736 You guys have now pushed into the rest of the seafaring mist. It takes you a while to move 024059.236 --> 024103.306 beyond the Dragshallow Reef, the better part of the day before you escape the channel at the pace 024103.306 --> 024109.395 you're moving. The clouds are pretty heavy now. The open sky that you enjoyed on your way to 024109.395 --> 024116.112 Darktow has now become-- not a storm front by any means, but definitely cloudier skies. As you're 024116.112 --> 024123.654 heading outside, you can see Yasha smelling the air and be like, "This might be getting close to 024123.654 --> 024126.340 "storm weather." 024126.340 --> 024127.693 She smiles. 024129.022 --> 024132.168 Continuing past into that space, repairs are being done best you can, with the ship still 024137.257 --> 024141.787 limping along. You make your way out of the Dragshallow Reef, out into open waters, and the 024141.787 --> 024143.457 ocean is yours. 024143.457 --> 024145.159 Yeah. 024145.873 --> 024148.431 Bring out the map. 024151.111 --> 024152.575 It's usually right there. It got moved for Honey Heist, that's why. Oh, is it down there? Oh, 024204.015 --> 024206.623 there it is! It got hidden! It got moved from me! 024206.623 --> 024207.310 Damn it, Bobby. There you go. 024209.335 --> 024212.132 You guys have just managed to make your way out of here. 024235.836 --> 024237.899 Well, that is the Wildmother. She is nature, I guess. 024244.943 --> 024251.563 It's a good thing I grew up a stutterer. 024317.886 --> 024323.572 Oh, I know Max Headroom. 024325.103 --> 024328.307 It's funny, I didn't realize who played him until years later and I was like, really, him? 024332.271 --> 024333.730 Oh, what's the actor? 024335.334 --> 024339.204 He was, and he played the part of Jobe in Lawnmower Man 2. Anyway! 024345.333 --> 024355.193 It's a resource stop. It might have some repairs, in your experience. It's not a major port 024401.857 --> 024405.563 by any means, it's more of a small-- 024405.563 --> 024406.537 Yeah, it's a resupply. 024407.374 --> 024408.794 From your experience-- 024412.813 --> 024415.417 To answer your question, Orly goes, "Yeah. There's a way to get that working for you. We'll 024445.127 --> 024458.357 "all take course and head for that m-m-mighty dangerous part of the sea." He marks it and they 024458.357 --> 024502.285 set it. You guys have been making your way around the Dragshallow northward towards that area. 024502.285 --> 024504.419 Okay. Is this an ability, or-- 024522.521 --> 024525.561 Oh, there we go. 024527.144 --> 024534.692 Okay, yeah. The Wildmother responds-- Actually, let me see what will be the best answer 024550.960 --> 024601.709 to this one, give me just a second. (stage whisper) Talk amongst yourselves. 024601.709 --> 024608.281 You get that situated. Anybody else doing anything? 024711.255 --> 024713.100 Your answer, by the way, is "Bisaft Isle brings you safest harbor in what you seek." 024722.943 --> 024726.673 TALIESIN and There's a warm, gentle embrace that comes with the words, an understanding, and a familiar 024735.325 --> 024744.638 matronly guidance that brings you calm on the ocean seas that have long brought you anxiety. For 024744.638 --> 024748.534 the first time in probably a good number of weeks, you get to walk out on that deck, take a deep 024748.534 --> 024753.309 breath of ocean air, and feel really confident. 024753.309 --> 024803.420 "Mm-hmm?" 024822.530 --> 024824.150 "Oh, I'm quite familiar." 024826.893 --> 024830.928 "About as close as any direction gets, really." Other eye, even. 024837.936 --> 024841.987 Making it jump around a bit, guys. "Mm. Very well. M-m-make sure to point this ship in that direction." 024853.699 --> 024854.835 "And you." 024857.802 --> 024903.511 Oh, it's still there. 024921.767 --> 024927.763 Okay. Make an investigation check on that. 024933.239 --> 024935.472 No, it is not trapped. 024936.679 --> 024938.612 The lower was 19? 024952.041 --> 024954.569 Glancing around, you find-- There's her dresser with a number of outfits, coats, shirts, 025012.341 --> 025019.192 things that belong to the captain that you guys get to distribute as you see fit. 025019.192 --> 025021.428 There's a few hats, yeah. 025026.800 --> 025028.176 Avantika-sized hats. 025029.287 --> 025033.553 MARISHA and I will say you do find some scented oils, but that's the extent. 025052.352 --> 025053.428 She's not a perfume keeper. 025055.213 --> 025057.452 The altar is still there, the altar to Uk'otoa. 025102.822 --> 025107.891 Yeah. You find a few other maps and things that refer to a-- You see it breaking down the 025117.922 --> 025122.124 different trade routes, and you see other paths breaking out; those that try and avoid the trade 025122.124 --> 025126.051 routes to avoid the pirates. Those different paths they might take at different times of the year to 025126.051 --> 025130.566 try and head off people that are trying to avoid the waters that they're looking in. You find maps 025130.566 --> 025138.500 that deal with the path to Urukayxl, and you see the handwritten map by Jamedi that was the path 025138.500 --> 025145.309 you guys were lead through on Urukayxl to find the temple. You find another map that has circled 025145.309 --> 025153.827 heavily the archipelago that you've already sussed out, and you find recent notes on that same map 025153.827 --> 025200.239 that refer to the loose area circled where your ship went down that time ago. 025200.308 --> 025206.155 Well, you'll get near that area. If you want to head that way, you can let Orly know to-- 025213.584 --> 025215.020 You find a lot of those materials. You get the sense that, aside from the maps, most of the 025225.225 --> 025227.928 information that she had, she kept in that book. 025227.928 --> 025235.692 You find a number of fine cheeses, actually. 025238.387 --> 025242.614 Not quite. All the good food was kept for the captain and some of it's turning a little, but 025247.467 --> 025257.845 it's cheese. Some better treats and some sugared candies that were kept specifically, like a 025257.845 --> 025300.769 private stash for the captain, you manage to find. 025300.769 --> 025306.316 Yeah. 025807.689 --> 025813.572 It's going to take you about a week to get to the location that you're seeking. 030150.194 --> 030152.414 No, the island's going to take longer than that-- to get to where the last time you recall 030200.104 --> 030201.538 your ship going down. 030201.538 --> 030203.748 Yeah, it would take a shorter time. It's about eight days or so to get there, eyeballing it 030207.677 --> 030213.143 from here, I'd say. More than that, ten days. 030213.143 --> 030217.452 Do you have access to Control Water? 030219.073 --> 030220.268 Then yeah. 030222.498 --> 030223.713 Okay. I'll say, with the Control Water-- 030227.641 --> 030229.352 It's in the cleric list, yeah. 030250.031 --> 030254.912 Between the two of you, it allows you a brief moment where you can actually surge the 030300.579 --> 030309.821 water and grant you a speed boost. I'd say that'll cut three days off of your travel-- the two of 030309.821 --> 030314.953 you, each day, spending that slot to push it. It's like a speedboat burst. All of a sudden, your 030314.953 --> 030322.723 giant, three-mast ship is going (crashing water), speedboating across the ocean briefly. 030322.723 --> 030328.950 Eventually, you make your way to the open waters in the vicinity of-- Orly goes with you 030344.500 --> 030349.500 each day and looks about and gives you the once-over and goes, "I'm pretty sure that we're 030349.500 --> 030353.144 "pretty dang close to that place you were asking about." 030353.144 --> 030359.161 Okay. It's a thousand-foot range, and it has to be something familiar to you. 030458.749 --> 030503.039 Okay. That's 2nd-level? It lasts for ten minutes. 030513.805 --> 030516.171 Okay, and how many spell slots do you have 2nd-level each? 030518.688 --> 030519.863 So if you're both trading off, it's about three chances per type of use per day. How many 030530.512 --> 030534.170 days you want to spend looking total? 030534.170 --> 030535.586 Yeah. 030536.600 --> 030537.969 It's up to you. 030539.305 --> 030541.300 Well, these guys can summon stuff with magic, if I recall. 030543.579 --> 030549.353 Altogether with the eight of them, it cuts the travel time down to five days. So you've got time. 030916.190 --> 030918.436 Okay, so taking your time, I would like you to each to roll a base wisdom check for each pass 030948.669 --> 030951.698 as you go through. 030951.698 --> 030954.155 Yes. d20 plus your wisdom modifier. 030958.081 --> 030959.713 Okay. Again. 031005.341 --> 031008.148 This is just check. Add your wisdom modifier. 031015.272 --> 031017.005 Okay. Roll again. Your third spell slot of the first day, hitting this space and scanning the load. 031032.399 --> 031033.364 Okay, and you're utilizing your memory of passage through here, as well as Orly's direction 031042.738 --> 031050.155 on this ocean. Go ahead and roll an intelligence check for me. 031054.848 --> 031056.434 Okay. First day goes through. Nothing catches your attention. You pass around, and then 031105.577 --> 031111.291 once you make it quite past the area, based on the measurements, where you think that you recall it 031111.291 --> 031118.127 happening. The next day, you make a curved turn and begin to head out to see some more land, as 031118.127 --> 031125.828 you can, to widen the perspective of your search. For the second day, roll again. 031127.387 --> 031129.087 Three in a row, yeah. Unless you want to use more spell slots to do more. So you can do your 031133.159 --> 031135.009 3rd-level to burn as well. 031135.009 --> 031137.820 (sneezes) Pardon me. Thank you. (sneezes) Pardon. Thank you. 031149.212 --> 031150.849 I am, at least. 031152.952 --> 031154.682 Sure. 031159.258 --> 031202.373 Go ahead and roll an intelligence check for you as well. 031207.958 --> 031209.570 Okay. You go through the second day, and towards the end, you, Caduceus, sense a brief 031228.556 --> 031235.874 moment where something ship-related catches your attention, and then is gone. 031235.874 --> 031238.159 Vague direction. 031244.904 --> 031246.075 Yeah, you're moving. So it's like, all right, let's go ahead and turn it around. 031248.808 --> 031251.369 You turn the ship back in the direction of where it goes. At the very end of the second day, 031256.379 --> 031304.665 just as dusk is starting to creep in, you make your way back in the area, and you sense another hit. 031304.665 --> 031309.037 Okay. As you're attempting to find the orb, roll a wisdom check. 031316.961 --> 031320.917 Okay. You lose your concentration on the Locate Object. 031323.599 --> 031328.697 You circle around again. You've closed off a distance, but you haven't quite located the 031335.039 --> 031340.035 specific area yet. You're trying to guide into a vicinity. I mean, it's hard to really remember 031340.035 --> 031345.455 specifically where, when it's just open water and a storm looming, especially. So you get to a 031345.455 --> 031348.911 certain point where you're like, I'm not sure I'm being able to help, but you're starting to get 031348.911 --> 031354.181 something. You're not entirely sure. The divination seems to be helping, or this aspect of 031354.181 --> 031402.762 your Locate spell. Evening comes to a close. You ride the night out. The clouds are still thick. 031402.762 --> 031409.148 The next morning, you can attempt again if you like, both of you. 031409.148 --> 031411.732 Make another intelligence check for me as well. 031420.441 --> 031421.979 Okay. Roll again. 031440.332 --> 031442.879 This is your second spell slot used today? 031444.500 --> 031445.529 Okay. 031452.391 --> 031454.503 Okay. Between the 21 and your 20 intellect in guiding the ship around, you find yourself now 031459.238 --> 031503.829 collecting a secondary blip. Once again, on the ship, not on the eye. 031503.829 --> 031505.124 You're concentrating on the orb, or the ship? 031506.793 --> 031508.171 The ball? You find nothing. 031510.924 --> 031519.319 So you create a Frumpkin octopus. 031639.979 --> 031647.090 (splashing) Frumpkin makes his way in the darkness. 031653.118 --> 031656.839 Okay. How long does it last? 031658.782 --> 031703.711 Okay. Make a perception check for Frumpkin. 031728.024 --> 031729.244 Okay. About an hour goes by. Nothing. Roll again. 031741.165 --> 031742.687 Frumpkin goes beyond your visual range for a bit. You start getting worried, and then Frumpkin 031751.523 --> 031757.171 returns and is making his way quickly towards the ship. 031757.171 --> 031759.606 100-foot is the connection. 031800.883 --> 031801.984 Technically, the distance doesn't matter for what you can see through his eyes. It's a 100 feet 031811.459 --> 031812.596 for it to communicate. 031812.596 --> 031816.486 Correct, during that time. So yeah, you watch through Frumpkin's eyes as he makes his way 031825.249 --> 031836.147 toward the-- finally finding the floor of this ocean. Over this second hour of his search, he 031836.147 --> 031842.991 catches one shape that is emerging like an obelisk on the bottom of the ocean. Upon getting close 031842.991 --> 031853.356 enough, you can see it looks to be the front of a wrecked ship, itself damaged and caked in 031853.356 --> 031902.944 minerals, ocean floor plant life, barnacles. It appears to be a damaged ship. 031906.214 --> 031908.370 Okay. Frumpkin does a circle on it, before feeling confident that he's discovered at least 031944.043 --> 031950.775 something of interest, and then beelines it back to the Squalleater. 031950.775 --> 031957.792 Then Frumpkin is now there at the surface of the water, without really a way getting back into 032000.893 --> 032002.041 the ship. 032002.041 --> 032003.788 Yeah, there you go, back in your shoulder. 032005.561 --> 032012.337 Over an hour. 032103.340 --> 032106.523 Like, just barely. From the distance where you are now. It'd be just under a thousand if you 032112.119 --> 032117.603 were right over, but you're not entirely certain how far. The boat isn't set for that currently. 032117.603 --> 032119.534 You've got weight. 032142.253 --> 032144.705 The stuff that you found at Urukayxl? 032258.260 --> 032259.681 That would be amazing 032300.757 --> 032302.582 You look up and on the side, there's the Plank King and Avantika looking at him. He's like, 032320.372 --> 032322.029 "Where you'd find these people?" 032322.029 --> 032326.251 (laughter) 032326.251 --> 032333.385 Well, once you make it in the ocean, you'll find out. Noticeably, Yasha is energized with the 032353.528 --> 032401.375 coming of the storm. Seems to be in more energetic spirits than you're used to seeing her. You guys 032401.375 --> 032405.755 complete your meal for breakfast. You gather your supplies. What are you going to do? 032405.755 --> 032411.426 Okay. 032457.089 --> 032458.215 All right, all of you now have the capability for the next 24 hours to breathe 032524.724 --> 032531.292 underwater. Your lungs feel heavier than they do while you breathe air. It's unique. No gills 032531.292 --> 032537.399 sprout from the side of your neck, per se, but the air itself seems to have a weight to it, and 032537.399 --> 032543.051 you're like (exhales). It's still breathable air, but the process seems to have changed a bit. 032543.051 --> 032544.400 There's no sand to fill them with out in the ocean, unfortunately. 032555.970 --> 032557.273 As a note, too, when the Squalleater came to port that night, Darktow was resupplied with 032612.415 --> 032616.650 cannonballs on board. For those who are keeping track, which would be-- 032616.650 --> 032617.686 You. The ship currently has a cache of 30 cannonballs. 032624.233 --> 032627.829 Okay. You maneuver the boat slowly also closer to where Frumpkin saw because when Frumpkin 032642.472 --> 032646.410 found it, it was at an angle away from you, which is how it was just beyond the range of a thousand 032646.410 --> 032652.012 feet. Moving over, it's probably close to 700 feet below. 032652.012 --> 032656.005 Okay. 032657.210 --> 032659.759 It's not going to go that far. 032712.126 --> 032716.163 Dancing Lights. You cast Light on? 032731.817 --> 032732.895 Yasha casts Light on her sword, the Magician's Judge. 032735.136 --> 032736.434 To the point where you're intoxicated? 032741.506 --> 032743.090 Okay. 032743.983 --> 032752.217 This poor little-- it's better over the days that it's been able to spend with you since 032811.317 --> 032815.605 Darktow, but this ferret's been through quite a few experiences. 032815.605 --> 032823.127 (ferret chattering) Then he curls up. He hears a loud noise (startled chittering). 032826.144 --> 032827.365 "Hmm?" I can't remember which eye it is anymore. I'll have to go check. "Mmm?" 032836.370 --> 032841.912 "Why?" 032848.741 --> 032852.481 You watch as Orly's head retracts into the shell slightly with this look of-- 032859.344 --> 032901.047 Marius steps up and goes like, "I'm happy to look after him. Actually been quite a while since 032907.100 --> 032909.004 "I've seen a pet." 032909.004 --> 032910.350 Marius LePual. 032912.001 --> 032915.289 He does look a little more ocean-wearied. As prim and proper and put together as Marius was at 032926.269 --> 032930.272 Nicodranas, he's definitely rocking more of a Pirates of Penzance thing now. 032930.272 --> 032934.393 "Of course!" 032937.772 --> 032944.267 "Are those the only options?" 032951.362 --> 032953.375 "Okay. Hello-- oh!" (nervous laughter) 032956.632 --> 033003.020 "Right." 033004.311 --> 033007.429 "Okay. Well, come. Let's get you some cheese and-- oh, that's my hand you're peeing in, okay." 033017.149 --> 033018.771 He carries him off. All right, you gather your supplies, you gather your cannonballs. 033022.181 --> 033024.313 As it stands, the cannonballs are smooth, solid metal. How are you bringing them down with you? 033041.505 --> 033042.761 That can be done. You do have a few sacks. 033055.231 --> 033102.151 I'll allow it, yeah. 033110.372 --> 033112.023 As you place the dagger against it, there's a brief moment where the dagger seems to shift 033116.202 --> 033120.405 energy and you slip it inside of it and at that point, the handle is now solid with the 033120.405 --> 033124.973 cannonball, so one cannonball has a handle. Another one, a sack around it. Actually, a few of 033124.973 --> 033126.818 them you can put sacks around it, so-- 033126.818 --> 033128.772 Yeah, she's coming with you. 033139.355 --> 033144.408 You splash and break the surface of the ocean. As you all begin to sink slowly beneath the 033206.532 --> 033212.297 waves, the light begins to get darker and darker the further down you pass. The shades of 033212.297 --> 033220.677 green-blue begin to turn to a deep green-brown, and even that light begins to fade, just having 033220.677 --> 033226.331 the few points of light that you are bringing along with yourselves towards the bottom of the ocean. 033226.331 --> 033229.523 Nott has not taken a breath yet, actually. 033235.253 --> 033237.202 You get to a point, Nott, where your lungs hurt so much you cannot help but breathe in, and 033243.371 --> 033247.090 there is a moment of panic as suddenly water rushes into your lungs and the nightmare you've 033247.090 --> 033249.287 had many times kicks in. 033249.287 --> 033254.057 It takes a little bit to adjust and anxiety is still spiked in you, but you begin to find 033307.369 --> 033312.715 yourself breathing water in and out-- like thicker air, but still air-- and it's more comfortable 033312.715 --> 033314.887 than you expected. 033314.887 --> 033316.565 You can. 033317.611 --> 033318.521 It doesn't have the same volume you do above water, which means you can cast spells underwater 033323.756 --> 033324.609 without issue. 033324.609 --> 033325.185 Yes, same as you had before. It carries vibration and sound travels far, but it loses 033333.141 --> 033339.293 enunciation at longer distances, but you can hear voices longer. 033339.293 --> 033343.685 Oh, this is going to be awful. 033354.569 --> 033359.388 Your feet find the bottom of the ocean after minutes. Ten minutes. Who knows how much time has 033414.277 --> 033418.294 past? It seemed longer than you expected until you eventually you hit the bottom of the ocean. 033418.294 --> 033420.041 You see the faint bit of light above where it marks where the sunlight is hitting the waves, 033425.829 --> 033434.720 but it's an impossible distance from you from this perspective. There are heavy, slowly shifting 033434.720 --> 033446.062 arms, waving tassels of kelp and sea vegetation slightly drifting and moving with every faint bit 033446.062 --> 033452.512 of water that gets maneuvered through with each wave and push as it goes, and you can feel it move 033452.512 --> 033458.006 you a few inches and you have to readjust as each one pushes through. 033459.876 --> 033502.607 You realize there shouldn't be waves this deep necessarily. 033507.719 --> 033509.335 You glance over and watch as a large creature is not that far away from you. 033517.021 --> 033519.288 You hear a faint (whale singing) and glance over the left. You can see a whale making its way 033533.992 --> 033537.812 through the water about 50, 60 feet from you. 033537.812 --> 033539.108 Not with a-- 033540.672 --> 033542.719 He still has the light. You can still see; Caduceus and Yasha still have the light on their weapons. 033552.231 --> 033558.793 The whale continues on, slowly moving, not really acknowledging your presence. You can see 033604.378 --> 033606.828 two other smaller whales alongside it. 033606.828 --> 033608.731 Everyone make an investigation check. This will be perception. Underwater, perception. 033623.480 --> 033624.999 Yep. 033626.475 --> 033627.988 Roll for Yasha as well. 033639.437 --> 033642.269 Oof. All right, overall party not so great. It takes you a little while, about two to three 033649.987 --> 033655.389 hours of searching the bottom of the ocean. You're starting to get a little hungry again from all the 033655.389 --> 033701.943 strenuous activity of moving and dragging these cannonballs with you to keep you weighted down so 033701.943 --> 033707.312 you can step across the surface. You come past some deep sea corals and beautiful colorful 033707.312 --> 033713.016 visions and schools of fish scooting and coasting around. At one point, they swarm past you, and you 033713.016 --> 033720.303 feel them tickling past your torso before they skitter past. Eventually, this lift begins to 033720.303 --> 033728.791 descend into a small bowl or at least a point where the shelf begins to head in a downward 033728.791 --> 033736.773 direction at a decline. Within the next 15 or so minutes of traveling in that direction, you see 033736.773 --> 033743.141 the outline of a familiar ship. 033743.141 --> 033747.813 All right. As you all gather in behind Fjord making your way in the direction of this long 033754.139 --> 033756.687 forgotten shipwreck, we'll pick it up there next week. 033756.687 --> 033759.420 (groaning) 033801.093 --> 033803.145 That was a good session, guys. 033807.753 --> 033814.719 That went some interesting places. There's a number of scenarios that didn't happen. 033821.766 --> 033825.413 There's a lot more on that island. 033830.113 --> 033835.014 Yes, we're not because we're law abiding citizens. 033851.602 --> 033855.853 Oh yeah. This has gone really interesting, fun places. Well, thank you guys. I'm excited to 033905.991 --> 033915.278 pick this up next week at the shipwreck. Thank you guys for tuning in. Yeah, I missed this-- two 033915.278 --> 033917.600 weeks off and suddenly-- 033917.600 --> 033919.041 You guys had some good, solid plans. 033924.025 --> 033926.580 Yeah. 033927.501 --> 033932.022 Man, most of D&amp;D is about plans that go fucking tits up the minute you try and talk about 033945.664 --> 033952.482 it. Everyone is like, "Oh, they planned so terribly." Every D&amp;D game, everyone plans 033952.482 --> 033957.390 terribly. Sometimes plans go great, and those are the ones you remember when you compare it to other 033957.390 --> 034002.028 people. "Oh, we're great planners. Remember that two times over the past 18 years we played where 034002.028 --> 034006.980 "our plans went great? Those are the times we'll always bring up and judging other people's plans." 034006.980 --> 034010.839 Yeah, everyone has some good plans every now and then. More often than not, plans go pretty shitty 034010.839 --> 034017.889 and that's fun. Anyway, thank you all for coming and watching along with us after the two week 034017.889 --> 034025.448 break. Thank you D&amp;D Beyond for being our amazing friends and sponsors. We'll see you in a week and 034025.448 --> 034027.937 remember we love you all-- 034027.937 --> 034033.620
