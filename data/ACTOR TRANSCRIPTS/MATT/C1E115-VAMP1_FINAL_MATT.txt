Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Store it! Hoard it! Vamp as much as you want, Taliesin, you have to start the game soon. (laughter) Look, I don't get to enjoy giving you shit from this side of the table. Yeah! Still there; they haven't gotten rid of me yet. Maybe you just yell loud into a canyon, it echoes back to you. I legitimately can say I understand. I know. I'm going to Uma Thurman. That's okay. I failed as well. My strength is two, my melee is zero, which is accurate. I rolled a five and a one. So a failure and whatever the X means. That's about right. How will you pinky swear? I notice the rat's there and I look at my broken hand. So instead, I decide I'm going to try to coax it near me. Hey! Hey little guy! Hey buddy! Six or above you said? That's three successes. How hungry am I? How cute is the rat? I'll eat the rat. Whee! It actually hit the rat! I listen out to see if I hear anything. I start going Sam! Sam, it's me! It's Matt! It's me! Sam! Sam! I'm here, Sam! You can do this, Laura! Sam! Sam, is that you? I spit bits of rat right up into your face. It's okay! Where's Sam? Thank you for having Sam send you. Yeah. Two successes to look around. So it's in Papyrus. I'm going to look for the lights. I'm going to slowly push open the door that leads to the hallway just outside of the set. Oh, sorry, closer to the Twitch studio. Based on her recommendation, I grab the helmet and put it on. Yes! While they're having this conversation, I walk over in my Power Ranger helmet and follow behind Marisha and where Laura might be, because I have no idea where she is. Oh yeah! Two successes. Where are the Warcraft weapons? I'll come with you to the office. Let's make our way to Sean's office. Okay. Trying to be careful as we go past the server room glass window. Stealth. That's one success! Just one. I'm not very stealthy. It's probably MSI. Do we see any discernable features beyond being a mass of flesh? We're trying to say on the other side of the hallway as we creep by. Just perception? Three successes and one failure on the red die. I know what this means! It's pretty fucking cool. Pretty badass. I got to take a picture, but I see my phone's not there. I'm like Oh shit, sorry. Marisha, I think we're all fucked up. Can I look for social's, Chris' sword that he always attacks people with? The foam one. To look for that, yes. I go Chris, give me your foam sword! Yeah! I was going to go bug him and Chris! What's wrong with you? Is this an amalgamation of many parts, or it one giant, pulsating Tetsuo type thing? Chris, give your sword! I shake him. Give me your sword! I look around for the sword. I take it! It's true. Before they do that, because I saw my lack of a reflection. Is it day or night outside? They're all blocked? I'm going to say Hey! Be careful! Be slow. Some of us might be sensitive to sunlight. I point. Marisha's probably still back in the office. You saw Marisha's face?! I never get this kind of positive feedback, I'm actually liking this. Stanima? Yeah. But I feel for you. That's not ominous at all, from a giant Lego Hardwick. That was a good roll for me. That is a crit success, with six successes. I'll go first! I just want to see, I'm really interested. I have a good mind for these things, and you know what? My intuition's telling me that I go first. Shit. Am I fine? Does it hurt me? It's not just ashes. Amongst the pile, there is still a foam sword and a Power Ranger helmet. This is important guys, don't leave that behind. Just for good measure. (gasps) You know, I knew that was going to happen, but when the compulsion kicked in I was like Well, I rolled pretty high. Lasombra. Well, thank you.
