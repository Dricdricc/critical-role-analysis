That was-- I'm so excited! Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they rise from the flames for the battles ahead. Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead. (music) (singing) Can you answer the call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll! [fire burning] We are pretty hurt here. Nothing that a good night's rest won't help. How can you tell if you're proficient? Oh, proficiencies and languages. Scroll up... no. Alchemist's supplies. Plus what? Oh no. It's at an angle! Move your fucking thing! You get advantage? Oh no, Nott! Are you injured? Cure Wounds. I gather in Infernal. (laughter) (shouting) It's the Traveler! What if it's Vera? Do you think it could be Vera? Okay! Me too! Do I see anything? 23! Hey! Hello? We saw you. Downstairs. Oh! (whispering) I bless you! (whispering) You get advantage. (whispering) Oh, natural one. Bless you! (clattering) (laughter) Can we see what it looked like? Too bad I can't make light. Yeah. Oh. Me neither. Okay, I was going to say Thaumaturgy, but yeah. Okay, I use Thaumaturgy and I send-- I don't want to use my duplicate. And I use my duplicate! I send my duplicate where the boxes are that they are hiding behind and at the same time I use Thaumaturgy to say (spooky voice) There are ghosts on the ship! (gasps) (gasps) Oh! There's no ghosts, you're so cute! Come out! You're so cute! Is it a little child-- You want some candy? Come on. What does Trixie look like? Yeah! Oh my gosh, Trixie would love Sprinkle! My little crimson weasel pops out from the hood on my cloak. Oh my gosh! It's so cute. What is the pretty thing? Okay. Can I touch it? Does it seem magical? Whoa. That's cocked. Ooh. 19. Have you solved it? Is it a puzzle? Wow, we have gold coins. Is it real gold coins? Is it fake gold coins like you and Caleb did? Wow, that's the coolest thing ever. We just have this lame old dodecahedron. She showed her stuff. We have this thing that, if you look really hard at it, you have a special gift. You should look at it. If you want to look at it, that's cool. When you open your eyes, I've got the thing, and I'm totally fucking with it. (laughter) I put the dodecahedron back in the bag. This is awesome. We should go upstairs and show you to everyone else. Oh my gosh. I dance behind her. What is this? This is the best day in the universe! You're meeting Fjord, and you're meeting Caleb, and you're meeting Caduceus, and you're meeting Yasha. Yeah, it's something like this. Then you do this. Yeah. It's a lot of wiggling of your hips, and it looks pretty cool. He's got pink hair; he's really pretty. She's got wings that are so magical. See, Yasha will love that because it's dry like that. That's really cool. No, it's fine. You guys can be best friends. Thanks, you guys. Our new best friend. (singing) She's so cute. This was downstairs. She's the cutest ever. This is Captain Tusktooth. He runs the ship. Fjord, can I talk to you for one moment, please? We walk away. Just so you know, I think she's really cool, and I don't think anything is wrong with her. I think she's the best thing in the universe. But in case you're trepidatious, because I can see on your face that maybe you are a little-- -- I do have Zone of Truth. Oh, well, I didn't wonder about that. I wasn't worried, but I guess I should. Okay, but her parents were probably pirates if she was stowing away. (gasps) Twiggy! How long have you been on the ship? About a week. It's pretty far, actually. Are your parents there? Except for Trixie! They're wonderful, Fjord. Let's sit down. I'll show you how to draw the perfect dick. Where did you get it from? Do we know of any museums or places with magical items in Port Damali? Natural 20! I don't know how to spell exalted. That's his cat-octopus. Owl, also owl. Maybe it's like a piggy bank or something. Maybe it holds a certain amount of coins, and you have to turn it the right way. Can you hear coins? Maybe they're really jammed in there good. Maybe it's because there are so many, they don't shake around. How much money do you have down in the box? Because that's a lot of times! Oh, it's half every time. Oh, Nott already took them. She can stay with us forever. Yeah, Kiri's wonderful. You can take care of yourself. She made a hand. Can you do cool things? Fjord, what are you doing? Yes! Best answer ever! What about Kiri? What about Nott? We're all friends. What about Cali? We all love each other so much. Hey, don't steal from us, okay? Good. See, we're good! Oh no! The Balleater! Wow. She can paint, too. As a side note, I am hiding my magic paint like whoa. That's really good. That's really, really good. We should take the sail down. Our flag was burned by pirates. Yeah, but that's a really big amount of paint to use for a flag. Yes, I am. Do you want to say we're up in the crow's nest? Is that a good place to be? Or would you like to be somewhere else? I know you've been below deck for a very long time. I'm in the crow's nest going Twiggy? Twiggy, seriously, come back to the crow's nest, though! I'm watching from the crow's nest. I'm going to teach Twiggy all about The Traveler. He's pretty cool. I feel like he would like you a lot, you know, because number one, he likes people that can be sneaky because it's fun, right? And you can be sneaky. Also, he has a cloak, just like you have a cloak. Really cool. Also, he always kept me company. I know you had a lot of time by yourself, right? So did I, and he always kept me company. (as Trixie) He's not quite like Trixie. He's more like (high-pitched) The Traveler! And he comes and he's over here! But you can talk to him. You could try any time. He's around, you know. Well, hold on! Give him a minute! Traveler, come on, I'm trying to bring somebody to you right now! No, he likes you a lot, I can tell. Yeah. Don't worry. He'll make himself known to you. No, we were around for it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we were opening her closet. Mending! The rest of the days I'm going to parade around the deck in her clothing. Different outfits. What! This is the best thing ever. I know, I know, I know, that's exactly where my mind went! Aww. Oh, this is definitely Pinhead stuff. Am I still seeing from the crow's nest all of this shit happening? What? What's going on? It's fine? Take your finger out. Is it gone now? Oh, it only lasts for a little bit. I wonder where it would have taken us? Was it big enough for us to go through? Do you want one of Avantika's hats? It would be really big on you. I'll tell you what. I will use my pretty paint to paint her a really cool pirate hat that is her size. Okay. It's like this big. Exactly what you want, yes. It has the tricorn. And do you want feathers and stuff? You got it, one big purple feather. Do you want any sparkly stuff on it, or a bow? Sometimes bows are really pretty. Totally. It will be a squirrel figurine on this, next to the feather. It'll be really pretty, okay. There we go. (poof) You look like a really good pirate. (gasps) What if the hole disappears while Nott is still in it? I feel like we should put our head through it. But do it really fast! You have to do it! I'll get ready with Cure Wounds. Take them! Oh my god, what if it's a safe in another dimension? Do we recognize it? That's definitely an H with a bow. Was there anything else in there? What if this ball is somebody's treasury or something? Yeah, that's what I mean! They've been storing stuff in it. (gasps) It's a vault! I follow him and sit next to him. Oh, cool! Okay. I'm going to tie this rope around your waist, okay. Then this rope is going to tie around your waist, now, so you guys are tied together. Then we're going to hold it up top. Okay, you have a minute. If you start to go too long, we're going to pull you up. That was it? Yeah, do it! Like what? Oh no. Does it smell like death in here? Right. Definitely won't lead to anything. (singing) D&D! That was not a sick beat. They're not right next to each other. I pictured a lover's embrace. Is this still the same day? It is. Okay. Yeah. I have an idea! What if we put on the red cape and then it does something if the statue behind the red thing sees it? Put it on, or something. Caleb, are you okay? Who wants to put on the red robe? The dead guys. I'm going to make sure I'm not in line with any of the banners. I'm going to step wide. Ugh, I can't reach. Sorry. Yeah, I'll do this, right back here. Oh god! You should put on the robe. Did you put on the robe? I can help you put on the robe. The wailing creature could-- Yeah, but he is in line with the wailing creature. Ooh, the center. Can we all fit inside of it? I want to stay, still, as much away from a line-up as we-- like, in front of the things. I'm going to soften it up with my mouth. I'm going to crouch, even in the thing. Do the red! Maybe it's fire. Hmm. Ooh! Fjord, look in your pockets! Of the red robe! Look in the pockets of the red robe! Whoa! Natural one? We should see what it is, though. Should we just go out, then? She makes a duplicate of herself. And she likes chocolate! I mean, I don't know. Maybe they brought her on purpose and they don't want us anymore. It's possible. Well... Okay, okay. (laughter) He always sends Frumpkin in to die. Does Frumpkin hear anyone? All of us. We're fine. Don't worry about us. We should follow her. I walk behind Fjord and I cast Blessing of the Trickster when I touch your back. Does the floor seem rounded, too? I'll go after Nott. Hey Caleb! You know in haunted houses a lot of time they attack the person in the back. No, that's a really creepy song from, that's from Insidious. Whoa, that's freaky. By gravity! Can we see any movement outside the flames? Oh, well, 11, no. Should we do it stealthily? I'm going to case Pass Without a Trace on all of us. 17. That was a neat trick. They make badass notebooks! Whoa! There's a ladder, you guys! Ooh! A door that works! Where's the fireplace? Is it straight across? Those books look like you could remove them and play with them. That wasn't cocked. We should have checked for traps and stuff, you guys. Does he have a ring on? Okay, that's where I was going. What about a green ring, though? Does he have a green ring? Wait, describe him. Say him again. And he's got lots of rings on. Oh look! I bet it's that guy! That's his robe! He's thin. This is old. Aww. What just happened? Where did Fjord just go? I'm going to run up where Fjord disappeared. That looks like an open book at the end of the room, Caleb. I immediately turn around and Invoke Duplicity down on the ground near them. Right next to them. Mm-hmm. Five, but I rolled a natural one. Voodoo doll. Okay. I'm going to turn around with my duplicate, and I'm going to cast Inflict Wounds on the cabinet. Can you do that? Okay, I'm going to do that at 2nd-level. Yeah, that's 4d10. 17. 20 points. Yes. Yeah, I'm paying attention to her and going (vague noise). You actually I don't think have Pass without Trace because I Invoked Duplicity, but whatever. That was pretty gross, straight through. Did anybody see what he was doing when he disappeared? I turn around and watch it happen. It's just a book? On the one on the table? It didn't come with us. What do you see, Beau? Okay. I'll get down so that you can get up and cast it. To come up on the level where Beau is? Oh no. Natural 20! Okay. The minute he rears up, I'm going to Invoke Duplicity again. Six. TALIESIN and Yeah. Maybe you can punch him with the gem. Is the dragon still on the ground, or is it-- Okay. I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians on myself. Yeah. So it saves. Okay, so do I roll damage right now? Okay, okay, okay. No, I think it's at the top of its turn, isn't it, that you said? Okay. Okay. Then I'm going to back up. The opposite direction that Fjord went. Yeah, to about there. I can't do anything for a bonus action right now, can I? I can't dodge or something as a bonus action? Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, then I'm going to chill out and say Oh no. Oh wait! Oh, I backed up. That's okay. Get the fuck out! That would kill us instantly if it hits us! At least, it would almost kill me instantly. Is it a negative d4? I know, right? I'm going to go-- Okay, Traveler, please let this work. I'm going to cast Polymorph on the dragon. Wisdom saving throw of 15. I'm going to Polymorph him into-- oh god. I'm going to Polymorph him into a crimson weasel. But at the same time, I'm going to go (shouting) Catch him! Because somebody has to catch him. Oh no. I'm really stupid, though. A six? Beau, do you have a reaction? Yeah, would it be like missile snare? Right underneath it? Oh, it's got too much? Yeah, I didn't hear-- Oh wait, I want to back up. No, I'll stay there. Am I within 15 feet of him if he's on the ground? Yeah. What a giant waste. Oh, I rolled a natural 20! I wasn't even looking at it! And I cast Hellish Rebuke as soon as it hits me. If I'm alive. I use Hellish Rebuke, and I go That hurt! In Infernal. Oh god. Yes. (gasps) I turn. That was cold damage! Oh, well, that's good. You get an attack, and the fire gets an attack. No, I'm sorry I just made a weasel and not a fucking cow or something. Even casting the spell in its vicinity. Try casting it. It's my turn? Okay, well-- Taking a cue from Fjord, I'm going to cast Blink on myself. Then if I try to run underneath the dragon-- -- he's going to get an attack of opportunity on me? No? Okay, then I'm just going to dash underneath it. No, by dash, I mean run. Sorry. No. I rolled a three. Okay, then for my bonus action-- I get a bonus action? Yeah-- Oh I can't. Oh! I'm going to use-- Nope. I've already used a spell. Fucking balls! I'm going to do nothing. I'm going to tremble. He's bloodied. He's definitely bloodied. Okay. A single scale is chipped away. Misses! It misses. That hits. Cool. No, you have to roll for it. Four! Okay. I guess I'm going to-- this is so lame. It's so stupid because Cure Wounds isn't going to do enough to fix me to where if he hits me, I'm still going to go down! That is at the highest level! I know. Fuck it. I'm going to cast Inflict Wounds at 3rd-level. It's just a touch-- oh, on a hit. Okay. Natural fucking one. It's okay. I'm all alone. I'm going to try and blink, then. Well, if I move it's going to attack me. So I'm hoping... 19! (cheering) Ten feet from where I was. You're in another plane. Oh, that's right! You have the mote! You don't see anybody in there. Yeah. Mm-mm. No! Oh, I can be ten feet away. I can be ten feet. I mean-- within ten feet, can I get away from the fire elemental at least? Oh, I killed him, yay! Everything's fine. But I wouldn't-- yeah. Okay. I mean, this is so stupid. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself because I'm going to die if I don't, at, I guess-- a couple of 3rd-levels left, so I'm going to cast Cure Wounds. Oh good! Two ones and a two. That's great. So four plus four is eight points healed. Sure. I mean, yeah. I'm going to run around as much as I can. Around the edge of-- without getting hit, without me leaving his melee. Then Blink. No. I stay. No, it's fine. He's so much cuter than I thought he was. His blindsight; he can see anything within 30 feet? Just go. What? Disengage! TALIESIN and Just go. Go! Okay. He used his reaction, right? One hit point. Double that! Oh my god! Why aren't we there? We can't see them! By the end I had 13, but if he had hit me one more time-- Yeah. That was Nott, the Brave. I turn and give Nott the biggest hug, just bury my head in her. It's probably safe to touch now, I mean, the dragon's dead. There were lots of jewels on the ground. You don't want to stay with us? I understand that. I would do that too, but I think I'm out of the ability. Oh, yeah, of course. I'm fine. (laughter) I'm a really good liar, Beau. I'm going to go to my room. (shuddering sigh) And go to sleep. It's the craziest thing! Twiggy forever! That set looks killer!
