Ashley. I lost so hard. Shush, you. (laughter) That's major! You'll never work on broken... what is it? Mountain? Brokeback Mountain II? That was a horrible joke. Just forget I said that. (laughter) Ever. Also available in green. Poop through a cone. You were the one who got us into the acid in the first place. Thank you for that. I don't know. We'll never know. Pretty delicious. He has both of us. I'm piled on top of Delilah. I'm barely conscious right now, right? Grog. Get this bitch off of me. Are we leaving? Grog. And I reach up and grab onto his beard. This is a beautiful beard. Watch out for traps. I didn't know. Where can we plug it in at? No, remember? There was one, the poison dust one which we're immune to still. I'm not that heavy. Oh no. I'm at one point of health. We're out of the room. Oh no, she could die, die. Oh! Really?! Okay. Where's my d4? Plus two. Oh, that's good. That's a whole eight points. Yay! I'm awake enough. I'm awake enough. I wake up and I cast Cure Wounds on myself. I'm like, "Ooh, I love me so much. Cure me." I think 2nd level. I have enough. That was not even as good as the common potion. Oh. Well, sort of. 14. So, basically full hit points at this point. 23 points. Really? Thanks, Scanlan. Understandable. Okay. Thanks, buddy. What do I roll for that? Whoa. I feel so strong now. 11. So I'm at 34 points. What? Scanlan! I'm just letting you know, you're not skilled with ranged attacks. I know. We need to take care of that orb. So wait, it's still there? Can I look over at Lady Briarwood and do a check on her to see if she looks stable? That's good, because I noticed your beard. That's right. I am. Trinket, careful. That's magic. But I'm still pretty low! If you feel like it, I would take it and I would be grateful. Pike, heal us all. We love you. Oh wait, but wait! Don't let Lady Briarwood in the circle of healing. We're away from the fucking sacrifice area. Maybe we should just kill her. I don't know. Wow! Punch her in the face! She'll be knocked unconscious and she'll have to save three times again. She almost killed me. The spinning orb of death. She might be unconscious too! Don't lie to us anymore! What?! Natural 20? Damn it! I had a really strong reaction to that. Yeah, but he's on this side of the table. Look at his eyes! He is the Whispered One! This is normally the time when Sam would-- Cassandra, does any of that sound familiar? When you betrayed us, you said you were serving a higher purpose. Did they plan to sacrifice you to him? Percival, don't! Oh god! I pull an arrow and aim it right at her head. Percival Frederickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, you will fight this monster inside of you! Oh shit! What did he give you? Oh, I will gladly do that for you. I check her person for anything valuable. You guys, he's got smoke billowing out of him right now. Pike, do you know anything about Vecna? And he created a vampire? He made Sylas a vampire? Do you need someone else to do it for you? Your thing?! (laughs) "Let me know if I'm lying, because--" 23! Ooh! Two in one! It looks like there was more tongue with you, though, Sam. I knew you were going to do that. I almost did it when he was whispering in your ear, just for your sake! Behind him? I shoot a holy arrow at it. Oh man, we're out of like everything, aren't we? Oh jeez, okay. Well, I've still got two 3rd-level spells. We have Pike! Oh my god, this has been in him for three years, four years. No, don't say that. It's too late. I shot an arrow at it! Yeah, of course he is. Oh wait, but we were holding hands at one point, so we would be close. That seems good, we're good. How did my holy arrow do? 25. Is it a surprise attack? Yes! 28 and 27. Awesome. Okay. These two... balls. So 15, 16, 17, plus holy damage? 17 plus four is 21. And then ten for the second. And then I Hunter's Mark him. I didn't say I Hunter's Marked him at the beginning-- I'm explaining this to you guys, because I'd already said I shot at him. So I was being honest. I'm looking at the chat room, because I know they're going to tell me I forgot my damn Hunter's Mark. Ooh, I didn't do holy damage for the second one! Yeah. Plus two more for the holy damage. Trinket moves around and in front of me to protect me. Yeah. Either or magic. One of the two didn't affect it. We have advantage? 22. 18 for Pike. Scanlan! Badass Pike! Your d20. What? He's a demon? I have favored enemy as demons. Oh. So demons are my favored enemy, so I have advantage against recalling information about them. Can I recall anything about something that looks like this? I'm not that smart. 12. Got it. Good to know. Okay. All right, then I'm going to cast-- where is he? (shouting) He's in the fucking wall! Hunter's Mark. Can I sense anything about where he is? So he's hiding? All right, then for my bonus action, I'm going to hide, as well. Really?! Well, hold on, let me add my stealth to it. That's a 12. I do pretty much nothing. And I'm going to hold my turn until he appears. Oh, right. I'm glowing. No wonder I rolled so poorly. It's beautiful. Right behind him? Whoa. We get advantage on attacking him? (groan) That was 38. Just kidding. LIAM and (singing) My math is awesome! Yes. Yes. Here's my question. Because I want to be honest and I don't remember if I said I dipped arrows in the second holy oil flask or if I put them on Trinket's claws. Do we remember? That's fine. Then I'm going to shoot two more holy arrows at him. Okay, well, I'll roll for that. With advantage, which is good. I'm going to switch things. New ones. (gasps) What just happened? Seriously?! So one was a 25. And then 17. I mean 19. 19 and a 25. Was the first roll. And the second-- Oh. See, I was rolling-- I understand. I was rolling it in my head differently, but we'll count it as that. I was counting it as that was my first attempts at my first two attacks and my second attempts at my first two attacks. Yeah, okay, that's fine. So, 25. I won't roll like that anymore. Where am I? That's radiant damage and that's that. Here we go. All right. 17 plus five is-- 24 points. 22. I'm still against the wall, glowing. We should probably light up this area as much as possible, FYI. Oh no. Yay, Pike! Is it times two after that because it's a crit? What was it, Pike? 21. Times two? Please? Oh no. Oh. Yeah, I did. 20. I know. I really did miss the whispers. I hadn't even realized how much I missed them until today. He's licking his ear a lot. Are you low? Pike! Didn't you get healed from your own healing? Yeah. She's running away. Me? Okay. Who all's around him? Pike and Grog? All right, then I'm going to shoot a couple of arrows at him again, man. I can't do anything. But he's still advantage, right? 21? And 28. Okay. No. I'm out of holy arrows. Because one of them was my exploding arrow. So that's... 21 for the first. Shitballs. Well, there you go. Goodbye. 21 for the second. I hide again for my bonus. 21 stealth. No, the one that I gave him. No, she didn't. Come on, come on. Oh my god. Because we're morons. (gasps) Cassandra! I cannot believe we left her alive! What? You're not going to kill the smoke beast? It was an 18. He rolled 18. See? No problem. This is why I look over your shoulder even when my math is bad. But she was almost unconscious. And then it's gone. Wait. 19 for me. 13 for Trinket. Do you want a bite attack or a claw attack? Oh, right, I have to-- no, yeah. Okay. That's 11. I rolled 11. What? No! Oh! Okay. 15! No, I rolled four. Times two is eight. Is 15. 24. 13 for Trinket. Yeah! And then right when he gets to his height, Trinket reaches up and bites him as hard as he can and lashes him around like dog with a toy. He disappears. It disappeared. Maybe it disappeared forever. (whispering) Percival. Wait, I meant to loot her earlier and it didn't happen. Sorry, I just really like that part. Don't you fucking do this to me. (gasps) For archery purposes? I'm like five feet away from you, at this point. I get up in time to smack him upside the head. She's naked. Good job, brother.
