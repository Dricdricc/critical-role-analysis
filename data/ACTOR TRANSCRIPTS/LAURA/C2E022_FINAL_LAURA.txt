I like how none of us knew that. (laughter) What's your name again? Did your children draw these, or-- Oh my god, please stop. I do. Sorry, D&D Beyond. For a split-second, you sounded like Kermit the Frog. Is it called a bangin' tree? We should probably sleep. Upstairs? Did they really? Well, what will we put in the doorway of the tree, though? No, are we sleeping in the tree? Oh, okay. Bird-Eye Fjord I think is what he was getting at, you know? I'm going to spend a little time with Kiri. I want to teach you some sayings. How long can you keep mimicking things? I'm going to take that as a long time. Okay, good. I'm going to tell you if someone asks what your name is, you say, "I am Kiri." See, look at this, this is great! Okay, and then if they go, "Are you nice?" You say, "Yes, "I'm very sweet." If they say something you don't like, you say, "Go fuck yourself." Yes. You say, "Fuck yourself." Yes, that's good. Okay, that's a good start. Oh no, don't do that, Kiri! Don't! I think so. Oh yes! Do you want it? But wait for the morning, unless you want to use it today, and then somebody else will get it in the morning. Because it only lasts for 24 hours. Oh, yes, here. Do you want to take it out of the bag? Here's the bag. (whispers) I’m putting it back on my body. Oh, you were sleeping on it? Just kidding! I'll do second. Her perception is low, you wouldn't see the high five. Let's roll separately! Yeah. Oh no. I think it's 12 for me. In the cavern? In the tunnel? What should we do? Should we wake everyone up? Wake up! She really does, let her sleep. Does Frumpkin fall down the tunnel, then? We didn't hide the bodies. Oops. Did you snap him out? Oh, again, again! I don't remember Cali saying that. Should we go down there or should we stay up here? Nott, shut up! Because there's treasure and stuff. Nott, please be quiet. Oh, I love her! Kiri, (shushing). I'm going to hold Sacred Flame because it's a cantrip. It might be going back and telling its friends, though, and they’re all going to come back. Probably. Oh no. What if it digs up a hole in another area, you guys? Dex save of 15. Ten radiant damage. You should really separate out your dice, Ashley. You should probably put another one of those things up, Caleb. Another alarm! No! And it's a fish. Cats are really perceptive when it comes to fish. With Yasha. (whispering) Run away! I'm going back to sleep, you guys. I need to get my spells back. Are you killing Caleb?! Oh. Whoa! You have a little thing! You have a little dimple on your chin! That's the cutest! I didn't know. Maybe soon, yeah. Should we gear up and head down and kill a bunch of fish people? All right. So you don't forget. Stealthily. Yeah, we're killing everything. Should I cast Pass without a Trace on us and be stealthier? What if I hold onto you and push you along? Oh Kiri. Where should we leave Kiri for this? We can't bring her over with us. We need you, Nott. Yeah you are! You can shoot things. And you can sneak around. Kiri, you stay here with Nott, then, okay? Wait, wait! Pass Without a Trace. Yes. 30 feet. So it’s not going to to be for a very long time. But-- Well it’s only 30 feet in front of-- around me. You'll go away-- huh? Yeah. Ugh, The Descent. Now it makes me want to swim through that little tunnel even less! Well no. He didn't take it. More than 30 feet away from me, right? He's more than 30 feet away from me. I should have given him Blessing of the Trickster. Oh no! Hey, you made it! That might be smarter, and then you could fight with us, Nott, for a while at least. You're so good at it, Nott! Your regular swimming speed. So yeah, that's pretty good. What if we just made a lot of noise in here? I'll get in the water. Well yeah! How long did you have to hold your breath for, Fjord? Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Pass Without a Trace. I don't know, but we can try it. Give me your books, Caleb. Give me the books. I did it already! Lasts for an hour, though, so it’s okay. She heard! Who's first? Are you going back through first? Okay. I'll go second. People should follow quickly behind me because you’ve got to stay within 30 feet of me. So we're doing the distract? But then they know somebody's there! If we just come out of the water and attack, we get a sneak attack. Just go for it! Caleb, Blessing of the Trickster on the way through. Oh, 16. Oh, no! 18! TALIESIN and Wow! Where are we? Oh, he's putting water effects on it! Shut up! Oh my gosh! We've never had smoke before! Should we try to do a distraction? Oh Jesus. Oh no. Eight. Oh my lord. I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon right next to that one that Beau's fighting. No, in between the two of them. Yeah, right there. At level three. It's extra big, that's right. It's got more sparkle to it. It's got more sparkly bits. I'm going to try to attack the one that Beau is attacking That was on 20-- That is not going to hit. He already took some damage, so I'm going to Toll the Dead on him for my action. He gets hit. Jesus H. Macy. Seven points of necrotic damage. Yes. I'm going to get out of the water, and I'm going to go stand next to that thing that's coming out of the ground. Yeah, that thing. Yeah, the booby. The big pile of poo-looking thing. Would I have had enough movement to get behind the big poo pile? Oh no. Run away! Okay, I'm going to use Spiritual Weapon that I have up and try to hit that thing. Ooh, that hits, that's a good one. 15 plus my attack. And then 2d8-- seven points of force damage to him. Oh, plus four, so 11! Oh man, that feels good. I haven't got that in a long time! I'm going to use the giant lollipop and it's going to raise really high up on the roof and then slam down onto it as hard as it can! I'm also going to move it closer to the one next to Beau. Yeah. And then I'm going to cast Cure Wounds at-- Should I do that? Or should I do Toll the Dead on him? Just kidding! I'm going to Toll the Dead on the one that Beau's fighting. Okay, hold on. TALIESIN and Yeah, well, you know. 60 feet. Okay, cool. It's a wisdom save and he's Hexed on wisdom. Disadvantage? Oh, that would have been better, then, huh? Yay, that's pretty much all I can do. Yeah. Two attacks? Oh. You didn't move at all? Okay. I'm going to use my action to Invoke Duplicity, and I'm going to make her appear standing right next to Yasha. But I can't use my action to make her doing anything-- Okay. And then I'm going to use my bonus action-- Yeah. Healing Word at level two on Beau. I know that's lame, but it's something. Oh that's good, that's 11 points of healing. That’s all I can do and my action, and I'm not going to move. Invoke Duplicity. Attack the one next to Beau. (coos) (laughter) It's okay, stick with the ones that were good for you. That one and the pink one. Technically, because Beau's on the ground? How much damage do you do? Because you hit it. Stairs? Are any of them looking rough? I'm going to have Jester run up to the one that Beau just hit-- yeah, the me. Yeah. And I'm going to Inflict Wounds on it at level one. It's a touch, though. Yeah, no, it doesn't matter. They're slippery little suckers. For my bonus, I'm going to move my Spiritual Weapon and try to do the same thing and hit it. Can I flank it and get a bonus on-- Okay, that hits. 11. And I say, tastes good, doesn't it? Help Yasha! Oh, that's a shitty side effect. I'm easy meat! She's okay. Kill it! Flurry of Blows it! Okay, I'm going to cast Cure Wounds. I'm going to walk up behind Caleb and give him a hug around the waist and say you're okay, my friend. I cast at level two, so that's 2d8 plus four. 12 points of healing for you. For my bonus action, I'm going to have my duplicity self run up and stand right next to the spot where the fish wizard comes out. Yeah. She's going to-- I'm going to step out of the water, by the way, for my movement. That's a really big cat paw. I'm going to run to the other side of Beau. Yeah, so I'm flanking it. Yeah. I wouldn't be able to hit it from the land, would I? Okay, so I would get a straight attack, right? Okay. I'm going to try to hit it with a level three Inflict Wounds. Well, a straight because it's flanked. That's 11. No, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Yeah, cool. I'm going to use Spiritual Weapon at level two and then try to slam it down. It's a level three Spiritual Weapon. It's a natural one. No, I cast Spiritual Weapon at level three. No, I didn't. I cast it at level three. I did. Yes, it's three. It was level three. It doesn't matter. I rolled a one. That's all I can do. Yeah, laugh. Laugh it up. I'm pregnant! (laughter) I didn't even realize I was sitting here like--- Kill it, Yasha. Oh no. Thunderwave. And from Jester. I rolled a 15. Five. I go low, you go high? All right. I go low with the handaxe. I go-- Are we still in initiative order? I'm going to Cure Wounds Caleb. I'm going to be so pissed off though, about nothing working. I'm just going to touch him with my toes. (laughter) Oh, that's good. 12 points of healing. I know, it's really cool. I'm going to use my Pearl of Power to regain a 3rd-level spell and then I'm going to use Prayer of Healing on everyone. So everyone I can see within my range. So everybody get within 30 feet of me! I'll do 3d8 of healing for everybody. Seriously? (shouting) Seriously! (shrieks through gritted teeth) So eight points of healing, you guys, for that level three spell. (muffled shrieking) This game’s going to make me go into labor! I'm not really mad. I'm fine. The smallest amount. Check for traps, you guys! I go into the water to look for her. Oh no! She's been taken! Kiri! Kiri! Kiri? Where are you? Are you invisible? Oh, Kiri! I'm going to find you. Say "warmer" or "colder," and I start walking around the room. Warmer? This is a weird-looking wall. Kiri! Good for you! I did too, just barely. It was a bad day for me, Kiri. Did you go stab a dead person? We should probably teach you that's not the coolest thing to do, I don't think, but it's fine that you did it this time. I'm sure he didn't feel it. But probably if we're in a place where other people are around, we probably shouldn't stab people that are already hurt. I mean, no, that's a lie. Unless they are attacking you. Don't stab people that are dead-dead. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Watch me roll a fucking 20 on this. Oh god no. That was cocked, and I just moved it. Oh good, that’s worse. Four. Were you holding those the whole time? Put those books in this pink bag, okay? All right. I'll have her hold on to my belt as we swim. Oh yeah, I put them in my coat. Don't worry, they're fine. Yeah. Just kidding. They're in the bag. Don't worry. Are you looking? Who's looking? (exaggerated cockney accent) Enchantment! Ooh, what are all these things, Molly? Yeah. I want to find something for the Traveler. 11. I'm looking for the Traveler's symbol. Whoa! Look! Oh, I wasn't talking to you. Look! The Traveler! Lookit! You have symbols here! It is a door. He's a traveler. He travels. Yeah. Well, if he is, he was fucking with me earlier. Are you in here? I don't think so. Which ones are the bad ones? Doesn't matter. Good job, Nott! It’s made of rubber. Maybe it's ceremonial. No, wait! Let Caleb look at it. What if it's super-duper cursed, Yasha? You know, there are a lot of shackles around everywhere, right? Didn't we find, like, four manacles? And there were four dead bodies, too, right in the other room? Why would you do that? Are you trying to bring about this really weird god? Can I reach in and try to get it out? Ooh. I reach in and grab that. What is this? I still grab the other little symbol. Want to look at it? Looks like it's an eyeball. I hold it up in front of my face. Can I see through it? All right. Of course I will. Thank you very much. I am. I'm listening. He's not talking right now. He's muttering. Are we far enough away from it? Proficiency. So 17. Is it magic? (gasps) Can I use Mending on it? On the sword. Yeah. Okay. Like an eyeball. I know. I pass it over to Nott. Here. I'm not learning anything. Take advantage. I walk back over to Caleb. It exists, Liam. (singing) I want to feel the heat with somebody! Can I touch his chest and his stomach? Caleb, did you Identify it before it went into him? What was it? You have the thing in you! Yes. Yeah, you stuck it into your chest. Who was he? I've heard you say his name before. Well, what if you're cursed now? How do we know you're going to be okay? You have a weird thing inside of you! Maybe he's alive and you were seeing through his eyes right now? Maybe there's more than one? (gasps) I feel like something's going to attack us. Maybe mermaids rescued you. Maybe you're a mermaid and you don't know. What was the explosion you talked about? Oh man, that's totally weird. That was the whole reason they attacked was-- what if they attack you now? Yeah! We solved the mystery. He's coughing up salt water again! I don't think he's a mermaid anymore. Caleb, can you Detect Magic on Fjord? Can you sense anything? No, let’s get out of here. Should we gather up all of the things and put them back up in the tree? Okay, we'll take it all back upstairs. Are any of the weapons that we found better than my handaxe? You're Beau. You're looking for a staff? I put it in the bag. Don't try to stick this inside of you too, though, okay? Won't the sound attract all of the things? I feel like the sound will attract all of the merrow people. Oh man, wait, but-- Oh, okay. I wanted to check out those bodies that were downstairs. No, the human skeletons that were down. They had manacles on them, though, didn't they? That means they were slaves or something. Blowing up a cave, I guess. Yeah, I'll help. Why are we doing this? We already did. Should we put them in the water or something? Caleb! Here's where you respond to her. It's so uncomfortable. (applause) Hey Caleb, do you know how to find our way out of this swamp? Yeah, aren't we done here? Yeah, but he almost killed us like super easy. Well, I have a couple of level ones left. Blam blam! That's great! You both heal 12 points! No, that was just for them. I'm sorry, Yasha. His sword keeps getting cooler and cooler.
