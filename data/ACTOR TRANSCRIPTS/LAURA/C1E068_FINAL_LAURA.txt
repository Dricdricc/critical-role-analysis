Merchandise. I've been organizing my dice while you guys were talking and so now I'm set. In the store, we have things available for you to buy. And-- I'm not as good at this as Sam is. Okay, so the rings there's two sizes left. There's six and seven. So if you have little itty-bitty fingers, you can still get one. The patches are out of stock, sorry people, but I'm proud of everybody that got one. The nail wraps are still there, the mugs are still there and the pins and the wristbands that Travis is wearing right now-- Those are available for pre-order for one more day as of 500pm, I think our time? California time? They're going to be out of the store. He's been wearing it every day. It does not-- It doesn't smell that bad! Yeah I know! The nail wraps-- only some, a few left in stock. That's good. We said like five hours is what I-- I pop Trinket out. Aw, buddy. You're tough. Do we see any tracks? Are there tracks able to be left on the glass? I'm trying to see where the people went. Survival? 18. Okay. What do your eagle eyes see, Grog? What's the possibility that Ripley can make herself invisible? It sounded like you said "petri-fried". I start taking my broom and swinging it around me to see if I hit anything that's invisible. Does the wind seem strong enough that if I hopped up on my broom that I would get blown away? Okay, I want to try doing that, then. Look at the water! It looks like waves. Did I get in the air before initiative, or--? Okay. Like 20 feet. Thank you. Trinket's going to be so useful against a tornado. Yeah. Of course, really anything. You're an eagle! Ten. Yay. Oh no. You're going to be the most useful one too. It's okay, it's power play right at the end. (singing) It takes two, baby! Guess I should have gone higher. What? Oh. That's nicer. 15. Cyclone of death! Yeah, it's also got a thing on it that hooks to me that Percy made. It's like a surfboard. When you shoot a whirlwind. Yeah. Scanlan can probably turn you back once you get over there. You're went 100 feet up, Travis? Grog? I feel like lightning is good because it turns glass into-- And stab the whirlwind. It is. That was so close to a one. 28. Oh no, there's two more? Is that a hit point ring? That's badass. Me. Ow! Ugh! I stand up for my movement. Okay. Hunter's Mark that motherfucker! Yeah, the big one! And then I'm going to shoot him! Twice! With Fenthras, which is the first time I've actually shot a real arrow for this one. Okay, please hit. 27? On the first hit. Natural one on the second, motherfuck. 16. A natural one is-- Okay cool. That's awesome. Great. So wait. That's a d8, plus a d4 for lightning. That's a ten. Jesus. Wait. Ten plus ten is 20. I know. 23! Four of them is lightning. What? Yeah. I'm establishing that and then Trinket can do his moves. Can I use the rest of my movement to get back up on the broom? And go up in the air? Get 30 feet in the air this time maybe? Okay. Oh, roll damage! Is it possible to go higher to get above the Wind Wall? It's saving its Whirlwind attack. How many hit points do you start with, Percy? Sick! Make the wind your bitch. Wow. What? Oh, you phony. Oh, you haven't leveled up. (laughs and imitates yelp) Of course it has, Taliesin. Can I fly over it so that I can shoot down onto it? Then, as my bonus action, I'm going to have Trinket run up and attack it. Yeah! Trinket's going to bite it. 26. 14 hit points for Trinket. 17 for my hit. And then the next one hits. It's higher. Okay! I know. 20 points for the first one. Oh, plus sneak attack! 24 points. Two of those are lightning. (counting) 14, and then-- oh, I don't get that that time. 14 points for the second one. Me. I missed. I rolled a one. 22. It looks like she dragged whatever she found further into the island. Can I call Trinket over and then look at the tracks and see if he smells anybody and see where they took everything? 15 for me. Should I roll for Trinket, too, for his smell perception? Oh, okay. I was seeing if he could catch their scent. And he's got advantage on smell. 25. Waterlogged, for sure. You also have that dog. They can maybe team up and have extra-strong smell perception. Or we can save it. Oh, well, I'll do one, too. Do you have a strong heal? All right. I'll do a 2nd-level, and I'll touch your face so I can heal all the little glass shardy things. 17 for me. Yeah, totally. Scanlan, take a greater and a regular healing potion. Percy, take a greater and a regular. Can you pass the spyglass over? I think that would be great on the broom. I'm going to keep this spyglass. Ooh, can I fly up in the air and look through it? Down at the ground. See what I see. Do I get advantage because of the spyglass? 24. What if I follow from where the path that I saw them dragging, and I follow through the trees? Can I see a path inward from there? Are they magic? Can we arcane them? Arcane check? No, Grog. Don't eat it. Is that what we saw? Oh, so he wasn't a magic user. I take the purple one, you take the red one? Why do I take them both? I'll keep the purple one. He wants one of those balls to put in his butt. Grog, please don't stomp. That is not okay. I'm keeping my senses aware for if Ripley's invisible and is around us. 28. Ooh. 30. Is it broken glass or smooth glass? I have a couple vials of poison. Can I dip a few arrows in the poison? Does that make poison arrows? (whispering) Be as quiet as fucking possible. I'm going to be behind him. Yeah. I'm going to stay behind him. How much farther ahead are you going? That always works out. Every time. Go for it. (quietly) Go for it! What? Well I figure when I go too stealthy, I pop him in my necklace, but okay. Yeah, for stealthy times. What's going on? What are we doing? (quietly) What do we do? Charge in, guns blazing? But we're not rested! You're creating a distraction? Why doesn't Scanlan create the distraction? I think Scanlan fucking distract and we all charge in like motherfuckers! I guess I pop Trinket out. And I get up on the bow. I mean, on the broom. I sit on my bow, then I realize that I'm-- I'm going to fly up to the top of a tree and try to be high up. Oh my god, that's right! He speaks! I thought it was good dog. Oh, that's not his real name? What is his name? Does it say it on the card? I wanted to be hiding up in a tree. I fire. We all fire! I'm going to shoot a bramble shot at her. Yeah. Then I'll try a regular shot. Since I can't see her, I don't want to waste my bramble shot. 22. Goddamn it. The other one misses, too. No! Oh, you're releasing it. You're doing it. While he's talking, I want to fly on a closer tree so I can get a better shot at her. I want to hide behind one of the branches of the tree. 26. Who? 32. Oh god, things are falling! Ooh! We both get it. Quiet! I can't hear anything Matt's saying. Oh no! 15. Trinket was on the ground, wasn't he? Dexterity. 21 for Trinket. 21. Good, because if he had taken the full thing, he would have been unconscious. Oh, so they are there? How deep is the crevasse? 17. Jump over her prone form. Can I say how much I wish Pike was here right now? Where am I? Well, I stand up. What are those circles next to Trinket? What are those? Would I be able to hide behind that? Okay, I'll do that and dash and hide behind the tree. Well, I want to get behind the tree so it's still coverage. Right? Then can I shoot from there? Is anything in range? I don't know; it doesn't say. The guy that Grog hit is outside of my range? I'm going to shoot at the guy closest to me. I want to be able to peek out, shoot, and then duck back behind the tree. What? Okay. I don't know what you want! That is a 30-something. 32. What? 21. What the fuck, man? That was the female warrior? I'm not shooting at the other one, dude! No! I'm going to shoot her again. 18 doesn't hit her. 22 on that one. Oh, and the last two had four points of lightning damage on both of them. I duck back behind the tree. Could I have had Trinket run over to the tree where Percy is? I thought it was a group spell. Is it not? Traps and spells?! That's good! Damn it. That's at eye level. Natural 20. 20d6?! 20d6! What level spell is that? Could he have Misty-Stepped closer to us? She's a bitch. And his rifle's broken. Misfire?! Ugh! I hate her. LIAM and Look, did you see how happy he was about this? That was the most satisfied smile I've seen from Matt in a really long time. Me? Oh. For a bonus action I'm going to take a greater healing potion. I'm going to do that at the end, though. Okay, I'm going to peek out. Who's seeable? Is the guy that I've been shooting-- Yeah, I'm going to shoot him. That is a 30. 15. That's with one lightning damage. And then, I'll do it again! That's a fun thing. Fuck. I can't add. 23. 17 points, with three lightning damage. Jeez, they're all still standing! Oh, and then I'm going to take my potion. I ducked back behind that tree after I shot, by the way. I ducked back behind the tree when I shot that person. Personally, I was flung. Yeah, move it towards where Ripley was! Unless if it hits Ripley, does she defuse it? No, we can't kill Kynan. I can't kill Kynan, and I apparently can't kill anyone today. Wow, that is so high. Just think, if it had been Percy, he would have thrown up. It's like Dragonball Z fighting now. Can you ride on Bigby's Hand through it? Do you have any healing bonus actions? I'm really low. I have no idea. Cool! The dice sticks to the magnets on the boxes. Oh shit! No, no, no, you're zero now. Now it's just death saving throws. Take it from us, we've been unconscious a lot. (laughter) (gasps) Yes! Yeah, Kynan? Kynan doesn't get hit? (singing) Six. Oh my god. Oh my god. We're going to die. Six! (gasps) Trinket is unconscious. No, no. If he's unconscious, he goes straight into my pokeball if I'm within 100 feet. Yeah, because Scanlan went unconscious. Good, that's good. Evening out the odds as we all go unconscious, they all go unconscious. Does she fall into the 20-foot crevasse? How many points did you take? That's it? Just 15 points? That's it? Oh, you poor thing! He's still like almost a hundred hit points. That's okay. You'll roll a natural 20 anyway. How is that sad? You're touching him. How can you not hit? (quietly) Your girlfriend's on the ground unconscious, and you're worried about some little-- Your girlfriend's on the ground. Ooh, can you get-- oh no, that's too far away. Are you still ducking behind the tree? Is he still alive? Oh, jeez! Oh my god! (quietly) Oh my god. (gasps) Pike, saving the day when she's not even here! Before she left! Before she left. Where was Scanlan on the initiative order? Is he before me, or would he go after me? I'm going to run up to Scanlan, and I'm going to cast Cure fucking Wounds with my shit-ass healing at level four. So that's 4d8 plus four. Yeah. That's not bad. 28 hit points. Can I do anything else after I've done that? I can't shoot any arrows after I've healed him, can I? Do I get one arrow? Okay. Then I'm going to, I guess, I'm going to run back behind the tree because I'm a loser. Jeez Louise. Okay. Wait, wait. For my bonus action, I'm going to cast Hex, I mean, not Hex, Hunter's Mark on Ripley. Scanlan! I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want! I want-uh, I want-uh, I want-uh, I want to go fuck them up! Do you get to hit him back as you run by, as your reaction? Oh god, she gets to shoot again! Misfire! Do I sense her with my Hunter's Mark? I want to try to shoot where she was. I just want to shoot one where she was. 19. Fuck. I'm going to shoot at Orthax. Natural one. Sweet. Tight. I'm going to get on my damn broom, and I'm going to get up to the top of the tree that I'm at right now. I'm doing it so I don't have to take a point of damage every step I take. Kynan! Your little project just killed your girlfriend. Is that sneak attack? Are you unconscious, too? Use your sword to do it! Maybe she goes into another dimension or something. Orthax just bamfed! There's shadow? What shadow is he using? I don't see any shadows. Are we really all going to die today? I like how everybody's like, I am really not wise. We need a cleric! We need a cleric with us all the time! Are you sure it's magic? Are you sure it's just not a chain that he gave you? You keep rolling that high. Yes. Scanlan. Clutch. Please roll high. Right after she disappears. Great. I guess I will shoot at Orthax. Yeah, I'm going to try to Bramble Shot him. Okay. 31. Do I add anything to that damage? Or is that just 4d8 piercing? So 16 with three lightning, and then he has to do a strength save or be restrained. He is not restrained. I'm going to use my second attack. 31. 18. No, Orthax. How did he get-- oh, that's Whisper. Oh! I can't say anything, can I? That's really good. That's really funny. Just hilarious. 21. Ten? Oh no! It has! Can you do anything as a paladin? Can you do anything? It's my turn. Trinket's in the necklace. I don't know. I don't know what I can do... I think I'll-- I just scream. I scream, and I start shooting arrows at Orthax. Ashley's asking to bamf in. Would she have felt anything because her necklace went off? That hits him for sure. 15 plus 18. 21 on the second hit. 19. Four is lightning damage. And 17. One is lightning damage. No, I want to fly over closer to Percy on the other side of the tree. Yeah. And I release Trinket. Oh, did I get sneak attack on Orthax? Eight. Eight more. He's in the necklace. I'm not leaving Percy. No, I'm staying. I'm staying next to Percy. I'll shoot her from a distance! I'm getting up on the log so I can get a clean shot at her. 26 and 32. I want an arrow straight through her heart, and one in her mouth as she screams. (tearfully) I'm still going to try and cast Cure Wounds on him. How do we get there, though? We're so far away. You could bamf us through a tree? There's no trees. Maybe I could put him in the-- No, not in the bag of colding. I could put him in the necklace and maybe stabilize him? I don't know. Ashley just texted. She doesn't work next Thursday.
