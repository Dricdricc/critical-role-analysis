(fake sobbing) There's shirts and there's hats and there's hoodies! And there's Tarot cards, and-- No, but seriously, the shirt of Matt, of our evil DM who's about to kill us all, you can get a shirt that has his face on it, evilly smirking, so it's perfect. Check it out! There's a ton of stuff available! It's great. And we've got some really awesome stuff coming up for the holidays, too, so keep that in mind. Terrible. He's shaking his leg so much. Don't move your leg! I'm going to take out a vial of holy oil, and I'm going to dip my needle arrows that Tary gave me into the holy oil. I'm going to pour the remainder on Trinket's claws. Oh! No! There, now we can! Okay, so advantage on saving throws? Anybody attacking us gets disadvantage? What? 31. Where's Vecna? Everybody just came out and we're standing in a big clump right here. I'm on the other side of Percival. Trinket is going to stay right at the entrance. Yeah. Good boy. He's just waiting to see what's going on. Oh my god! Make sure you get his good side. Did you do this, Matthew? You made this, didn't you? You painted it? Really? I already forgot. It's like I just walked into Target. I've lost all brain function. 25. Ashley, what did you roll? You might go before whatever some of the shit that he doles out. He's just going to consistently dole shit out. Of course he does, he's a god! Everybody gets advantage. Yes, and he gets disadvantage on things against us. Any spell from an evil creature that attacks me takes 4d6 radiant damage and is knocked prone. Yeah, we all popped our blessings. Yes, Pelor! 12 radiant damage. Woo! He's bloodied. He's definitely bloodied. Oh, for saving throws? Sorry, I rolled my-- And what is this? Saving throw for dexterity? 29. Plus three. That's 32. 32. Wait, if we roll a natural 20, that doesn't mean it's an automatic success? We still have to add numbers to it? So 34? Can I do an uncanny dodge for any of that? That's just for melee attacks? You have resistance to fire, too. So you get advantage on that saving throw. So if we can't fly-- You're splitting the party! This is crazy! Matt, this is so cool, but terrible. Not anymore. Because she lost Holy Aura, because he fucking did all the damage. Yep. That fast. Was he knocked prone? Of course he is. It's only up against a wall, for Vecna. Theoretically. 20. Yes I did. 12. That's so crazy! They're like floating things? Reckless? We all rage. Yeah, you do you. It's true. So it is up to you. I don't know what that is. It wasn't him that did it. It was the other guy. It was the death knight that did it to you last time. I'm going to look over at Percy and grab his hand for a second. Nothing at all. Hunter's Mark! Yeah, get ready Vecna-- And I'm going to run over to where Grog had been-ish-- Cry over you? Not quite that far. I'm staying against the wall. Yeah, that's better. Not that it matters very much. Then I'm going to shoot him with my holy damage/needle arrow. Okay, that is a 30. Great. Can I make it a bramble shot? 41 damage. And he has to make a strength saving throw. Well yeah, but-- Oh wait! Oh, never mind. Yes, 41 damage. Okay. I'm going to hit him again. I'm going to hit him again with another needle arrow. What was that before I hit it? I don't what it was before I hit it with this dice. LIAM and Sorry. Actually, I think that was probably it. 25. No, that's a 25 to hit. Okay. That's good. 25 hits. 19. That's it? I don't get any sneak attack? Nothing? 19 points. Does he get any holy damage from those arrows? Oh, all right. 19. Plus another one point of damage. Yes. I forgot. Yes. Trinket is going to look around, really confused, and scooch a couple of squares closer to Pike. Yeah. Great, cool! To hit? I guess, yeah. Great. He takes 4d6 radiant damage again, from hitting me. Nine points of radiant damage. Oh my God! That means we get Grog back! Can he do that? How many legendary resistances does he get? He has as many as he wants. He resists everything. We have to keep hitting him and try to break his concentration. Plus four! Oh, I was going to hand him the same one! Get your skeleton ass away from me! To hit? Doesn't hit me! Does your armor, Pike, do anything against people that are attacking you with melee? You're little and light. Hey Scanlan Two. My face is so red! Scanlan, you can do so much! You would know what Scanlan knows, and he did know that. Your wand gives a plus one to spell attacks and shit. Does it not count as magical? Or is he resistant to bludgeoning? Yay! That's five of them now? Hope you didn't kill our sister. We're all hurting. So your weapon is magical, isn't it? So you can do damage against him. I feel like if you can break his concentration. Yeah, hit again. But that might make him break his concentration. You got this, Percy. You've got this. You got this! Did he take a concentration? (laughs) You're just repeating everything Matt says. (laughter) Or turn into something that attacks? I'm looking rough. Oh, tight. Thank you. Who, by the way, we didn't do meteor damage for. You're a dick. Trinket rolls-- what is it, a dex save? 19. He only got 70 points of health. He couldn't do anything! Dang it. He really wanted to help out. He even rolled pretty good. Maybe not quite that high. And Scanlan Two. Is yours wisdom? And yourself, Pike. Do you have a bonus action you want to do? Oh, great. Thanks, Pike. Ashley, I think it might be in our text chain between you and me. Who's he talking to? You? No. Can you resist it? Do it. This could be-- (gasp) Oh, Feeblemind. Hex is back, don't worry guys. I'm freaking out. Oh god, he's so high. Unless everything falls. I'm going to take a picture just because. Oh no! Scanlan! Is it a one? Can you inspire yourself? Oh, okay. I'm going to kick off on my broom and I'm going to fly down to Velora-- Yeah, but. Brother-- Yeah, but I'm before you and I saw her fall. It's not like I want to do it. Yeah, I'll get her. Is she awake? Fuck. Do I see any kind of landing around me, anywhere where she can set down safely? All right. But I used all my movement. I can't get to it and get her there. I'm not going to toss her. No, she's unconscious. Okay. I had to go get Velora. She fucking fell. I'm not going to let my sister fall. So that would have been a 13 was the lower number. Maybe he's just pretending like he's not upset about it. It was his journal. Was that a dog? Oh, well that. That doesn't. Oh, it's a 13. 25 isn't high enough? Oh, his thing is 26. That's right, you're inspired! Am I within that area? If I went down to save Velora? Thank god you're not there! With the Legendary Resistances. Do you get legendary resistance every round? Okay. Probably. No, it's a 7th-level spell. Do all of the things that we gave him fall down to the ground? You should do it, but you should do it when he comes back. That's the thing. How high do they go? Psh. Yes! Yes! Really using all those platforms of yours, Matt. Do you have a bonus? Fucking shoot him. But there's not even anybody over there. Okay, Scanlan, you've got this. What the fuck, get rid of that dice, Sam. He's got a 9th-level spell. Could do something. Yeah. Oh no! Do you want to hand me that-- Oh, you already got tape, you're prepared. This is amazing, Matt. Fuck yeah. Guiding Bolt at 6th-level does 9d6 radiant damage. Shamone. Does that double the dice? 18d6. It's nine, just double it. I like that we're looking like we can see. Pickle Pike! For Grog. That's fine. You're still 20 feet in the air. Bludgeoning and fire. You took less than a hundred. How many hit points did you have? Oh, you don't restore all your hit points with Polymorph. We're starting up at Grog's turn. That's an action, not a bonus. Why? Is he going to try and do what he did to Grog? I wonder if that's concentration too? It probably is, right? Okay, I'm down there with Velora, can I tuck her away in a safe spot? Under my hat, definitely. And she's unconscious? She's dead?! Did everybody know that and I didn't know that? Fuck. I tuck her little body away and hope that it's safe, fucking shit balls. Can I fly back up? Yeah, I'll hover away, I'll fly straight up from where I was with her. Can I attack him? I mean, my bonus actions are-- Okay, tell you what he knows that I'm down there, I'm sure he sees all but can I come up and hover in the air and bonus action hide behind that wall? Do I roll for stealth? Did you see how that dice did that? It was like, fuck you. 24. So you've got one hit point now? So it'll knock you down? Great. You're going to fly straight at his face? Oh my lord! Makes sense. He's a god. Of course he does. That would be a feat I would take if I ascended to godhood. He's immune to fear. How do we get Grog up there? Okay. Sorry, I'm sorry. Freaking out. Do you have to take it if you use Luck? Okay. Circle of Death? But Mass Cure, you can choose a point. Mass Cure Wounds, you can choose any 30-foot sphere within 60 feet of you. Yeah, because you don't see me because I'm hidden on the other side. Fuck. I'm hidden on the other side of the wall, so would I have been sitting there on my broom, like, as the wall has shifted away from me? Zahra! Hi! There's shit going on, she wouldn't even have noticed me. Hi! Oh, thank you! It's very hot, but I'm going to put it on for a second because she complimented it! Oh that's true, he does have a chain weapon. Can you do anything? That's good. Okay, this hat is so hot! You're pretty close to being that. What are you doing? Such a dick move. Wait, Pike, I don't need that much! I only need like 20. I need 20 hit points. So good, you have enough for everybody to get back to max. So that's the thing, everybody's back at max. Plus the two for the feast, so. Move. Get out of range of him, if you can. That'd be killer. I don't know if we can. Everybody's fully healed. Oh my god, really? Oh, poor J'mon! No! You guys got major damage, though! Oh, you can do that! Well no, a 22 wisdom will get him plus seven, or plus six, to his-- So he's got to roll a 20 and then add ten to it. So we've got to roll-- Yeah, we have to get them all in. Which is so easy. What are you doing? You can do Finger of Death this time. They were held. They fell. Okay. I'm going to shoot some arrows at him. Am I hidden? Can he see me? He probably can. He can see all. Of course not. But my brother is not with him anymore. Cool, tight. All right, then I'm going to attack him with a needle arrow. Natural one. I'm going to attack him with another. Well I just bundled up my sister. Yeah, that just happened, still. Cool, I'm going to try to hit him again, with another needle arrow. Okay, that probably hits. Yeah, that's a 28. It's a plus one, because it's a needle arrow. Yeah. I'm going to call out For Tary! How about that? 11, is that it? Oh yeah. 16 points of damage. No, I'm going to move. I'm going to move around, over to here. And I'm still on my broom. I'm going to use, well, I don't really have anything I can do with my bonus action. Oh no! It's foreshadowing! That's it. Damn it, god power! 34. Halved, again. He knocked us right back down. I mean, that would have killed us right off. Straight up. You've got one. 70. They're going to try to take him out. He's so little the skeletons are swinging above him! You've got wings? Where are you at, Arkhan? We're immune to fear and you have advantage on any wisdom saving throws. Just hanging out. 28 plus 15. Oh! You have to take 4d6 radiant damage because you hit me with a meteor shower. Ten damage. Radiant damage. LIAM and And then get three grits back if they die. Oh no, Scanlan! Don't you have a healing potion left? 8d4? That's good! That's good. In the future, you play D&D across states. Where do you want to move, Pike? You want to be right below where you were, basically? What do I add to it? I can't remember. It was 30 plus 30 or something. It was halves of everything. And I add it to what, my constitution? No. 17. You know what? It's fine. It should have been gone. No, it's 26 you have to succeed against. Are you immune or resistant to necrotic as a planetar? Where are we at? Whose turn is it? Trammel him! Yeah. She's flying. Do it! Pike has Ioun's. You have mine, right? And then the Raven Queen's is the janky one. He has Pelor, and he has the Raven Queen. 70. I have plus four to saves, if I have to roll a save. We have advantage on saving throws. Constitution. Okay. 23. I'm resistant to necrotic damage because of my blessing! I fucking hate Finger of Death! And I'm going to Hunter's Mark him! And I'm going to hit him! I'm going to try, at least. Instead of Hunter's Mark, I probably should have taken a superior healing. I probably should have done that. Yeah, can I counter? Can I un-Hunter's Mark him and take a superior healing? I already said it. It's fine if I already said it. I said it! Okay. Fuck it, I'm going to try to sharpshooter him, because everybody's up there. 31 plus three is 34, minus five to hit. Oh, and I get sneak attack because there's a bunch of people on him. Okay. 39 damage. That's my first arrow, and I'm going to try to do the same thing again. He does take 4d6. Thank you. 13 points of radiant damage. And I'm going to try to hit him again with sharpshooter. 28. I moved that. I'm going to roll it again, because I didn't see what it was. 29 minus five is 24 to hit? That's cocked. 18 was the second attack damage. And I'm going to hop on my broom. I'm already on my broom. I'm going to fly so I can get closer. I'll hover here. I want to be closer to Pike. Is it possible to get across to the other side? Could I get here? Am I within range of Pike, then? 60 feet? I'm higher than I would be. Okay. I'm going to be about that height, but I want to be over the edge. Yeah! Who did Arkhan come in after? Did we skip your turn the last time? Raging for 12 seconds, really. Your hand would be open. Or into the bag of holding? Oh no, it's moving again! Do it. Whatever you do, add your d4. Never mind. Oh no. She might be able to pass it to Grog, too. Oh, that's good. Yeah, he might have to do Pike's, too. It's just that Vecna gets to go between us. Are you resistant to necrotic? I know. I just was hoping it would be half again. Bonus action, I'm going to take a superior healing potion. So that's 8d4? Okay, so I'm back up to 67 hit points. Fuck. Oh! No, stun, there's nothing you can do to take the effect of stun away, is there? Oh, that's it? Not Lesser? Fuck me. Okay. All righty. I'm going to fly up to Scanlan, and I'm going to cast Cure Wounds at 4th-level. That's 4d8 plus my wisdom. Oh, that's good! 14, 21, 27. 27 plus three. 30 points healed! Thank you. (singing) Something has changed within me. All right, but it's so hot. But I'll do it. That's as far as I can move, right? I can't move any more? Can I get over the edge of the floating building so I'm not flying over the crevasse? Thank you. (singing) Just Scanlan and-- (speaking) No, sorry. That was terrible. Whenever possible. Why so low? You do? Jenga. On who? And you would have gotten to attack him! Yeah, we don't get necrotic for the next turn. But if we can break his concentration, they come back, right? Big damage. Yeah, that's good. No! That's our Grog! Anybody got a camera so we can put this in the scrapbook later? You don't get that because it's strength. He's marking off a resistance. You just did that, didn't you? As in, don't keep attacking him. If we keep attacking him, he's going to take too much damage. What's your hit points at now, Scanlan? I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on Scanlan at 3rd-level. 19 plus three is 22 hit points, and I'm going to fly down next to Percy. Don't do too much damage! Can you grapple him? I have 3rd-levels left. Which you did. Give it a try, Keyleth. Because what difference does it make? You have nothing to lose. Oh no. Just the one to break his concentration. Oh my god. Yeah, right? What's your health at? I know. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds at 3rd-level on Percy. Six, nine. So 11. No, 12, sorry. For my bonus action, I'm going to take a greater healing potion. So that's 4d4. Yes. Whoa, that's good. 11 plus four is 15 to me. And then I'm going to run over to Percy, and I'm going to hold his hand. But I'm going to keep looking up at what's going on up there. Oh my god. I grab Percy up on the broom so we can fly up. Grog and Pike are. I'm staring at Vax. It is so late. But he would have still been a god, technically? Oh my god. I love you guys. Johnson! What time is your call in the morning?
