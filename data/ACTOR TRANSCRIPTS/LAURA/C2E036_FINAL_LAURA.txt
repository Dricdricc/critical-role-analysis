New York City! That was great. I wonder what I said. Yeah. Oh my gosh. We have our first Keyleth shirt. It's in the store right now! There's two styles; we got our "Sleeves are Bullshit" shirt-- why don't we have it? TALIESIN and We'll bring it out during the break; it's really cool. Go check it out at Crit Role shop.critrole.com. You know, they've got one that's sleeveless, that's a girl's, and then one that's unisex that's not as sleeveless. And those are pre-order, so if you order them, they're going to ship in two weeks, so that means they're not sold out immediately, so that's really great for people that want to actually get them. We also have our Deven Rue maps. By the way, that Keyfish-- this Keyfish-- was designed by Lauryn Ipsum, who's phenomenal and we know her from her work on the artbooks. We have our mini Yasha bust in the store right now; we have the Wildemount dice that are still in the store right now, and there's other stuff like a bumper sticker that you can proclaim-- I keep talking about the bumper sticker. That's right. I do! I really want to see the bumper sticker. This is the uni-sexy one. It's so uni-sexy. (British accent) Look, I don't know if you can see it, but it's a goldfish with little dice trailing behind, and then there's a special little treat at the bottom that says, "It's fine, we're gods." I was on my way down, right when I stuck an axe in the back of a guy's head. I accidentally stuck an axe in the back of a guy's head. I didn't mean to though, I was aiming for his shoulder. I can do that. I don't know if I have it prepared, though. I do have it prepared! He's not dead! I'm out of spells. Is it like a puncture wound? Can I cast-- No, no, no. I hold onto his ankles. I know it's really terrible. I'm sorry that I did this, I hope you're okay. I mean I can cast Spare the Dying, but he's already not-- Yeah dying. I cast Spare the Dying. Well, I think, you know, maybe Deuce could do something about it? Yeah. See if he'll come down here for a moment. Don't move the axe! What if his brain starts leaking out?! Don't do it! That's so messed up. He got an axe in his head. Yeah, see! Oh hi, bud. Thank you. So we have this ship now, but I just wanted to say Hi, welcome to the crew! You know, we're The Mighty Nein! All your friends are gone right now, but it's because you attacked us first, really. No, see! That's okay! I understand following orders. SAM and Hmm. What were you guys doing? That's it? No, I don't want to do that. That was really sad. That's so terrible! Yeah, I think that seems like something we're going to do. Who do you work for? He attacked us first, you know. Oh, really? Why? I like it. Yes, we did. Is there some stuff you didn't get to? What was the message you were trying to get? Do you see it, Caleb? Do you see it? Do you think Mending would help fix that, or would it make the piece of paper come together? Mending! Okay. If we drop you off, are you going to change your name or something? Are you afraid Avantika is going to come and kill you? No, you go. You go next. Like the ball? Is it the ball? Docktow? What's that? Is that what this is? Swavain Islands? Why does it say Y, Y, Y, Y? Because it's on the other side of the reef. On the hunt for ancient relics. Only two will find out. LAURA and That's the island? That's where the island is, then? What's your name? Gallan. I like your name. Have you heard of The Traveler, Gallan? Have you heard of The Traveler? Do you want maybe a brochure? I could tell you about him. You could spread his name wherever you go. All right. What does she look like? You should be important! Yeah. Do you know how to sail? What? We should change the name. Like Mysterious Ball. The Mysterious Ball. The Mistake. Does it? I don't want to ride around in The Shit. You just draw it, you don't live in it. Man, you did a really good job with what you were told to do. Well, okay, I'm going to go upstairs. He's not tied up. I will take that. It's okay. Temporarily. If you jump overboard, we'll jump after you, and we'll bring you back. Congratulations. Yeah, I don't feel doing that. Maybe you should just go upstairs. Hmm, okay. I'm just going to tie your hands while you're sleeping, though, okay? All right. Poor guy! What was his actual name? SAM and Hi! That guy who I stuck an ax in is actually still alive. Yeah, Caduceus saved his life and he's really nice. He's a pretty nice fellow. Well, Caleb did technically. Yes, she's very religious and is interested in relics. Maybe she just likes to collect things. He said that they were mysterious and her whole crew had some sort of magic-y stuff. Imagine if you swallow another one, how powerful would you become? Those are the arrows, are the ping-pong points that you have to hit and then you get to the island that you-- He said it was bad. He didn't make it sound like that's the one that-- Avantika. Who knows, really? It could be Avan-teek-a. We'll try not to. I really should sleep if we're going to do that, though. We should really figure it out. I wonder if in the morning we can ask Gallan about it, maybe he knows one of those sound familiar. Well, let me go downstairs and wake him up. The Mistake. Would we get there in two weeks? Because that's how much food we have. And sea monsters. And my mom and our puppy. We should definitely talk about it. That is a really good question. Stealing comes with a pretty hefty fine. So does killing people. I walk over to Caduceus. Um, hello? I sit down cross-legged in front of him. How are you? It has. Hmm.. Wow, no. I don't think I ever have had a plan. What is your plan? What was your mission? Like how? Do you sometimes hear things? Well. A lot of times I think that maybe the Traveler has left me and I think maybe things are going poorly and he doesn't like me anymore, but sometimes he'll just show up after a while and tell me that I was on the right path all along, and he just made it fun for me to find it again. You're not afraid of death, are you? Breathe. The world is a lot bigger than your cemetery. There are a lot of things for you to see, and you have to break out of your comfort zone in order to find the path that you are looking for. Just keep doing that. You can't smell dead people when you're on the ocean. Yeah. Yes. Do you want to make some food? We have a lot downstairs two weeks' worth. Let's go. That's good for scurvy. That sounds so lovely! Should we go up for the meeting and then come back down? Oh sweet! We'll bring up and give people food while we have our meeting. Spicy fruit! It's spicy fruit. Super disguised. Port Damali's all the way up at the top. We could just stop at the next city up. Port Zoon. That is a lot of time, though, to get there. Are we seriously considering bringing the ship right back to Nicodranas? How much did you make when you were-- I guess I could maybe-- can I try to cast Mending on the sail and see if it looks like the burn damage goes away? Maybe I can paint something on the sail so it looks like a different boat. We don't ever mention ourselves. We could just sleep before all this stuff happens because damn! It probably has already spread. Can we just sleep? I'm so tired. Can we go to sleep even if we're just sailing around? They're going to see us. They'll see us when it gets lighter. I'm going to go sleep, okay bye. Found a carpenter! Plus it was dark when we left, and nobody saw the-- Good thing we changed it to The Mistake. (singing) Guess what I can do! I can make things! Fjord can tell me what they look like. To Fjordie? Is it painted on or is it chipped on? I can do that! Well, we don't have to unfurl it. Okay. I'll rewrite the name, at least, on the side of the ship. Yasha, hold my ankles! I'm holding paint! Yes! I'm dipping because I'm hanging upside-down! We should disguise ourselves. I do. Of course! Yes, of course I can. Yasha's going to stay on the ship. Should I draw up the deed? Should I be? Okay, I'm doing that as we're going in and stuff. I thought you said you had? Oh good question. I speak Infernal. Yeah. I hate that it's intelligence. 20. This is really pretty. Oh, right. A little lavender oil right in the corner. We should take it to the dock. That way we have you. It doesn't look burned anymore, does it? Disguise Self as we get closer. 18 plus three. To say that we've been here awhile or something? Give him five gold. Yeah, right? Hiring crew and we're going to get some food for the thing. Okay, I've disguised myself to look like an old, grizzled sailor. Well, let's do that. I'll do 50 gold and you do 50 gold. Yeah, and you can be the captain. No! He drove her crazy with love! And she killed herself because she couldn't be with him! I love it! (gasp) I remember! Was it Orly? We can send a message to him. Yeah, hold on. This is a powerful spell. Come to The Mistake in the Open Quay. Come to Mistake in Open Quay. We've got money for you as a navigator. Marius. Dear Orly-- Come to Open Quay. The Mistake will hire you as a navigator. Lots o'money. That's one word. O'money. Of money. Okay. Lots of money. No, no. How many words do I have left? Come now. Also, The Mistake is a boat. He's coming. Shush, just let him get on the boat before we tell him these things. How are we going to get enough gold to pay all of these people? Is that the Inky Claw Reef? Let's off-road it! I told you, sea monsters! I can't tell anything about what's happening here. Port Damali. Nicodranas. Let's do it! And Yasha! Which island? Oh, that island. I see it, yes, I see this map. Why? Have you ever heard of the Silver Silt Palace? Okay, just checking. Hey look, it could be the path leading us to more dead people, yeah? I want to send a message to her before we go to sleep tonight. To my mama. Mama, stuff happened at the docks and we had to leave very quickly. Please take care of Nugget for a while. We'll be back, I promise. You may have heard about the little girl who was killing herself on the dock-- Yes, this is my second message. My second message that looked like me but it wasn't me, don't worry, I'm very much alive, and I love you very much, and I'll be home soon. Want both of us to do it? 15. Fjord, have you ever seen anything like this before? Really? Yeah. I've never seen anything like this. Really? Sometimes things that are the most beautiful are the things that can hurt you the worst. Are you worried about where we're going? That's good. You're not afraid that this captain is going to hurt you? That's true. Yeah. I promise I'll heal you if you start to hurt, okay? You're welcome. Do you ever get sad? Yeah, that sometimes things don't work out the way you were hoping? Only sometimes, but it passes really quickly. I miss my mama already. I thought we could see her longer. I don't know. She thought about it one time with my dad. She was planning to leave with him, but then he never came back. I would like for her to be happy. I would like for him to love her. I don't know. I would like for her to not have to work anymore. I'm pretty noble. Oh really? This is a pretty good plan. Then we can use that money to bribe The Gentleman to go back and woo my mama again. That could work, too. Yeah. Thanks, Fjord. Oh my god, can you imagine? We would be so broke. You're the captain, just take it. You're the captain. Captain Fjord! I'm blue! Like the famous little owl with the star eyes? (as a fish) Nice boat! What the fuck? What is it? Oh god. MARISHA and Was it a parrot? I hear there's parrots on pirate ships. Humanoid-ish? What the fuck was it, Fjord? Can I climb up to where it was and see if it left anything behind? Like poop, or a feather, or-- A wallet. 12. It had claws. It was last campaign, Travis said. Yeah. 18. Fucker. 24. Okay, I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon as my bonus action right above the singing harpy and try to slam it down upon her head. What-- that-- I don't know. I feel like that shouldn't count, but whatever. That is a 12. Oh, good! 12 damage. Then, I'm going to use my action to-- To cast Toll the Dead right over her head! And ring a bell right across it. Wisdom saving throw of 15. Yeah! That's 2d12. Seven points of damage. Ah, ah, ah! Yeah, I guess. I'm on the sail, right? I'm on the top? Can I hold on? Can I grab onto rope or anything? Or is that like an action? Could I consider my movement to like reach down and hold onto like-- Beetle damage! I want to do that. Oh. Six! Your rolls would've been better. You rolled a one on your hit. We both suck. 11 hits! Necessarily an "accomplished climber." Always say yes! Okay, I'm going to use my spiritual weapon to send it to the harpy that is trying to get that guy off the ground. Nine plus seven, it hits. Eight points of damage to him. I think I'm going to use Guiding Bolt on the one that was flying away that was singing. I get 120 feet. Okay, okay, okay. Yes, level one. I don't know what I add to it. It's an 18, I get 18 plus whatever. Oh, okay plus seven. It's good. Oh, come on. Seven points of damage. Damn. Show off. Not yet. Can she jump and swing? Yeah, there's one left. Can I hang from my rope that I was holding on to and slowly start casting Mending on the sail? (shouting) What's wrong with Caleb?! I'll do it! I drop down. I have, like, really good medicine training. (exhaling heavily) I'm going to try to blow into his mouth as hard as I can. Oh good, you're alive! I start climbing back up. (whispers) 12. I'm working on it! I bought a couple barrels. Do we get advantages on those or something? Oh, yeah, yeah! Focus on this, Fjord! Gallan, go! Go fix it! I'm going to stay down where it was and cast Mending as much as possible. Oh, yeah. At all. I'm just going to keep my hands on the-- Yeah. Come on, Tusktooth! Gallan! Gallan, come on, carpenter! No. Yeah, I want to help block it. I'm going to-- Is there any furniture I can rip apart and we can nail to it real fast? That dropped out of my hand, it shouldn't count. Aw, it was so much better when it didn't. Nine. Can I use one of the barrels and start scooping the water into the barrel and lift the barrel up and out and try to carry it? Can we take the barrel that I was holding the water in and stick it over the hole and then hold it? Okay. Goddamn it, really? 12. I'll help. Two. MATT and Ooh, Gallan! Yes, of course. Okay. No, no, no. Okay. What was your spell doing? Yay! How long will it stay? Nice. Long enough for us to patch it up. Off to the side. Park it away from the other boat. Yeah! We'll figure something out. Costume on Amazon. Yay!
