Go us! Yeah! Trinket! We should probably rest. We're by that lake with the giant monster. And went down to that place that you told us not to go in the first place? Yeah, that's where we ended up. Right, so we don't really - oh, we can take hit points. On a personal level, or? No no no, we're going into the cavern. No, we're going into the tunnel. No no no, in through the tunnel. That tunnel. No no no no no. And popped this out right there. So now we're going into this. That's behind us, we're going down down down. Shall we? Does he need healing? Scanlan, stop being creepy! Does it hurt us to get near it? Oh? Oh? Yes, but what about water? Oh my. Oh, nice! Oh, okay. Lovely. So, should we try to cross this little path here? Can I use my tracking to see any of those duergar? To see if any of them have passed through the area; if there's a large group of them ahead of us? I can use my tracking and my favored terrain to see how many within 6 miles, if there's a large group of them. Ooh! Here we go! Oh, okay. Okay, that's better. Is that it? 21? So, as quickly as possible, we should get through these tunnels, I assume? Yes. So 3 to 4 miles up, you said, from where we are at this point? We should probably start stealthing at this point, yes. Should we all try to stealth? 20. This is where Kima’s being held. She had a vision. Oh, that’s where the trapdoor is! Yeah. You missed a lot, Scanlan. Sweet. Oh, yes! And we know here, because the general that we mind melded - Clarota read his brain. I know. It’s just you were drunk, so I’m reiterating it. (all laugh) So remember, Scanlan, that the general said that on the left side of the fortress-- --is how we can get into the trapdoor. By the smaller of two lava flows. Lava flows. Yes. by King Murghol? So, there is a lot of cover as we go near it because of all the…? It’s pretty dark here, right? But nothing at a distance. So we should keep to the left and head down that direction and try to-- Right. And Lady Kima's being held here. Yes. Yes, it's on the left. Yes, so we're heading left and going-- You guys take care of Trinket as I'm ahead of you. Oh, I'll go back, then. Should I? Or is it okay because we're all together? 20. I can ambush them! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Well, okay, but I can - (whispering) I can be really quiet. I can do Hide In Plain Sight now. So, I could completely hide myself standing there. Oh! Can I look? Okay, let's look. (whispering) Everybody stay quiet. They won't find us. Potentially. But I want to hear what they're saying. What does that mean? I'm Vex, he's Vax. We look alike, it's understandable. Oh, no, then don't. Keep Pass Without A Trace. That's okay, that’s okay. Just a little bit ahead and see what we can see. 17. Wait, no! I get advantage on perception, because I'm in my favored terrain. Oh, yeah, never mind, okay. (all laugh) Yes. Hold on. (gasps) Oh shit. Fried banana. Thank you, chatroom. Okay. So, we walk back. So, apparently, number one, big party, we don't want to fight them if we don't have to. Secondly, there's some weirdo creature that's gotten loose and is very, very bad and it's killed multiple duergar already. That might be the thing-- No, but it might be the thing we already killed. It could've been the thing with the plate that showed up in the camp, I don't know. The big thing. It could've been that, I'm not sure. Regardless, we should be very careful, traveling forward. I like the way you think. All right. Should we keep moving forward at a very stealthy sort of pace? Possibly. Could be farther. Can we see the molten things that he was talking about? The lava flows? Still too far away. Oh wow. (laughs) Don't say that. (whispering) Be quiet. Ooh! We should go towards that one. No, Scanlan, what did you do? Can you persuade the DM? Come on, come on, d20. (soft, high voice) No, no... yes, 14. (all laugh) I'll stop. (gasps) Oh god. (gasps) Stop! Can we stop? Can we stop? Scanlan. Shh. (whispering) You're singing. Is the arm attached to whatever did-- --Is the arm part of a dead thing or is it alive? Can I check it out as well? I mean, I'm there, I might as well. Wait, I'm doing advantage, too, just in case. Okay, that one's better. No, I got it because I'm fucking in my favored terrain. (all laugh) (Gasps) This is the skelly pile. Yes, definitely, a very large beaver. Based on tracking and everything and insight, can we tell if that creature is anywhere nearby? Or if it's gone? (gasps) It's that big creature that - it was like one of those things that that thing put together, like-- And it seems like it was here recently, or a while ago? Should we get out of here? We could try to set a trap, or we could look and see if we can loot anything? Is there anything to loot? Does it look like anything shiny? Okay. I like gold. Ooh! Well, we killed a lot of duergar this time. There's a big centipede-y human, creepy creature that's killed a lot of things and we should probably avoid that at all costs. Can we avoid that and still head left of the keep? That's where we're going. LIAM & Should we probably have looked for like a nest? Yeah. So we should just keep freaking being careful and keep going towards the giant thing. And that makes you want to make out with him? Let's keep going. Oh, really?! And this is plus 10, already? Oh, Percy! (gasps) You have a plus 10. 30. Oh no! Just a person? Can they see us? Does it look like they can see us? (whispering) So. There's a person standing right there. (whispering) A person. He's just standing there. No. Hmm. Maybe it's a scarecrow? Yeah, that's what I mean. Can't you go invisible? Go invisible and check it out. Oh no, if he's magic, he's going to know. (whispering) It's a statue. Oh no! We do have basilisk eggs in the bag of holding. Oh, what's that? Oh, it's Scanlan. What was it? Can we look at Clarota and say “Do you know anything about this?” Have basilisks. Do we remember how to take care of basilisks? Like, do we not look at them, is that how they don't-- Don't look them in the eye? Or don't look at their face? Yes? Okay. Oh, well, never mind. He's got it. All right. Yeah, let's keep going. Did you know him? So you know how to do that? Didn't we do that? Didn't we have to do that? I turned to stone? I remember, I remember. Yeah, I remember that. Okay. Okay. So we'll be careful. Nah, fuck it. Let's just keep going. It's got bat poo on it, let's keep going. (whispering) Thin one! Thin one! Yeah! Creepy, creepy, creepy towards the thin one. Okay. You don't to need check it again, he didn't tell us to. Oh. Right, right, right. Can I come up and look and see if I can see any tracking? If there's any footprints around a certain area around this. Yeah. It's okay, no, no, no! I get an advantage. Shush. Is it investigation? 22. (gasps, sighs) Okay. Does it look like it's safe to bring everybody up here or does it seem like anything's around that could see us? Anything looking from above? Okay. We're going to have to be super-- Yeah. You can? Do you have something that can pull it towards you? Ooh... Oh yeah, maybe you can move it away, and then cool it. Yeah, I guess we came back to the group and told them about what's going on. Oh really? Wait, but he's got sneak attack. Yeah but we could-- If Keyleth can bird up or you could go over on the flying carpet or something. Oh my god. (all laugh) I can try to arrow them out too. Maybe you should go up and I'll arrow one and you... I mean, Pass Without Trace, there's silence? The chicken is delicious! I'm just not going to let you see me eat it. Right. I mean, if you can flip them off the roof that would be awesome. Okay, then do it. We'll just have to be fast. Be really speedy. Okay! Yeah, they'll fall in the lava pit, just shove them off the side. Well, just do it. Just be ready to let us know if you need help. Oh my god this is so stupid. Give me the flying carpet just in case I need to fly. We're doing it! Please can I have the magic carpet? Oh my gosh. Oh my god. This is stupid. Yeah, me and you get ready to shoot. And you're going to bring them up if you can. They'll fly on Keyleth. Eagle. All right, do it. Mission Impossible. You can charge them off if you want. Be really quiet while you're fighting, try to take them out before they-- Go! (whispering) That's so loud! A really quiet Thunderwave. Oh, okay. Keyleth, fly up and cast Pass Without Trace on them. Get ready. Yes! We run up and kick him into the lava! Can we just run up and kick him into the lava? No, no, remember you killed that kid one time. I’m Vex, he’s Vax! No, no, don’t do that. He’s lying. Oh no! Ooh! Yes! Keyleth! Run! Or can you turn yourselves into duergar? What, am I too excited about it? Turn yourself into a duergar! Make it seem like everything’s okay! Turn into a duergar! Act like you’re a duergar! Say everything’s okay! Oh yeah, that was good. Maybe Grog can push it! Can Grog push it? 65. Oh, 65? (laughter) Shit. I'm amazing! 25. 18 for the second one. I'm using my fire bow. 20 damage on the first attack. 13 on the second. Can I shoot at the other one? It was such a good idea. Natural 20! Yes, thank you. Nice. Oh! I attack him. It's good. My first attack is a serious fail. My second attack, though, is a 25. Ow, that hurt my arm so bad. Great. 8. (nervously) Haha. Nope. Nope. Yes! That's badass, Percy. Let's get in the door. We all go in the door. Can Trinket fit? Trinket can fit. If Grog can fit, Trinket can fit. Into this (high voice) teeny-tiny little room. Oh. A bathroom break room? Ooh! Can we take an intermission break at this moment? All right. Oh wait, quick announcement. What?! Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Singorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear - her own stolen Trinket - to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages. (drumming battle music) (drumming battle music continues) Autographed photo. We're going to look into that. I think we should go through the door, instead of going up. Because any prisoners are probably going to be kept at a low level. Can we very stealthily try to open - oh, check for traps! (sniffing SFX) Mairgil. Mare - Mairgil? Ulara is her name. Queen Ulara. It's Ulara! Ulara. Shh. He's picking a lock. Be very quiet. Yes. So that other stuff is upstairs. Oh! Okay. I throw up in my mouth just a little bit. Oh, that's good. Oh, shit. We should move fast. We should get out of the room. We start getting out of the room. (whispering) Come on. Hurry! They're going to start coming down these fricking stairs in this room. Did he go down? Oh, geez Louise. We're getting bored. I get out. No! I come out, because you're taking too long. No no no. I said we stay in the area, but I wanted to check on my brother because I feel like he's taking awhile. And he was just gonna check the doors. You don't want to tell us what you found? Oh, no! Look at this. (gasps) We should just go down. That's me. Did you mean to give it to him? At the same time I reach out and I go (arrow SFX). And I was going to shoot at the other one. 27. And 25 on the same. Let’s do both, one on each. Yeah! So I was really useful! 15 on the other guy for me. I go running back up since I’ve already shot my arrows. And I figured you’ve got this. Oh, shit! Can I throw an arrow at him? There are so many prisoners down this way. Everybody fucking come down. Yes. I say on my earring “I think we found the prison cells. Get down here.” Why? No! That’s not bad, that’s still not bad. Plus what? Well, let's go look in the open door. Stealthily. We need to get them awake. No, they're regular dwarves, they're good people. Oh no. Why don't you unlock the prison cells here? Can we go in? Can we talk to them? Oh God, I nock an arrow, notch an arrow? Eww, Keyleth. All kinds of nastiness. Do we need to move out of the way of the stairs? Scanlan, where are you? Well, Trinket's coming down. What's in the other door? Oh, it's Kima. Oh, you didn't check for traps. And I yell ‘hold.’ Yeah, tell him to stop attacking. Possibly, if no one else is behind that door. He's in a room by himself. 15. (Gasps) Oh, Keyleth! I know, let him go in the room. Oh, well, let's make this nice and easy. I smack Grog on the ass and say, "Go get him". Impaled? Oh! Oh no! That's so gross. Oh, sick. Pike! I think Grog, um, I think he did his job. (gagging sounds) That's our girl! Come heal her! It's her. It's gotta be her. Can we insight and make sure that it's really who she-- Great, I don't get any... Anybody else want to roll for insight? Well, let's let her go. Lady Kima, we need to get you out of here. Which sounds better? She's raging. Yeah, where are they? Do you know? There's a vault? Let's find the frigging vault! (whispering) Yes! All right. Yes, let's let all the other dwarves out, and maybe give them some food to try to help them out, if we can. She's really fricking buff. That's pretty badass. She comes to your knee. Can I run in the little prison, and tell the dwarves, if they are conscious, to say, “Don't exit from where you came. “There's a secret entrance up and in a store room. “Go that way, and stealth out.” All of that, I say all of it. Here's some cheese! (all laugh) It's Velveeta. Oh goodness, oh goodness! (gasps) Wait- Wait! We see a single tear drop from Clarota's eye. Don't threaten Kima! She's better. Oh god! Not good? (whispering) Oh my god, she's so cool! Come on, roll a 20! But they were under control of K'Varn at that point. Yeah! (gasps) What? I'm so nervous! Oh, Scanlan, come on! He assisted because he was talking-- He assisted? (whispering) Oh, thank god. Allies? Good times. Is my... I whisper in her ear “I would have chosen you.” Oh god. Okay. No, yeah, that is a good place, or we're going to get in a battle. Oh god. Completely empty. She's Allura's friend, she's good! Would you pick Kima? Okay, yeah. That would be the most awkward humping ever. Kima is a halfling. (mimicking Ashley) Hold on, hold on. Lengthy hand-razor. (More laughter) Ew. Hey. Really? Nice! Right, right.
