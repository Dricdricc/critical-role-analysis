Just that it's the coolest. No, it's actually weirdly personal to put it together and put it up. It feels like you're baring your soul. So I hope you guys enjoy my soul. And also, song three, which is like... everything. Right? I may or may not have been thinking of the Critters while I was picking that song. Just so you guys know. That's beautiful. There's a lot of presents, you guys. They had to open it so that we wouldn't be opening the boxes. We got a little spoiled. I got a little spoiled early, though. Somebody sent a new Trinket! Look at that, you guys! Look at him. He's so cute. Please! I have just been hugging it non-stop. They're really cool. I got this wood. These are the Kickstarter boxes, though. These are what's being done now, or are those for sale right now? And these, too. These are deck boxes. Yeah. Done! Let's make this happen. Count Dooku. Oh, god. He's a goliath? That's a lot of people. For a door! Every single one of those guys can attack you now. Run away. No! You have 115 hit points. Are you immune to any kind of damage? Then just go through the door. Can you set a blaze? You have a lantern! Your AC! Oh no. I know, what does this mean? Oh, okay. Yeah? You do?! It's raining up there. I know, maybe you should just keep burning it. Oh no! Burn in the hatch and then get out. Can you Bigby's-Hand slam down onto the Count? You've used all your spell slots? Can you float? Maybe you can slide down Bigby's Hand. Otherwise, you'll burn alive on a roof. Austin Powers. They're attacking the zombie giant. That's good. Oh, that's good! Yes. I like that Scanlan takes out an entire house, and we're all probably going to die. You're a legend. Trinket went with Grog. You can do it, buddy! Can I ask you, really fast? I never leveled up Trinket's hit points when I leveled up. That's important at this moment. 56. Four? Oh, god. He just keeps adding them! All the shitty guards were over at the other house. 61. I know, I'm like, "Which ones?" Oh, should I roll for Trinket, too? Oh, he goes when I go. 17. You're cheating?! It's insane. Grog's beard is better than that. The one with the shitty beard? Then you add a ten to all of them? Doesn't hit! Hits. Yeah. Yeah, he doesn't care. We're all going to die. 16. Me? And Trinket. Okay, so I run in after Percy and my brother. And Trinket-- Oh, I can? Oh, I do want to give Trinket a round of combat, so yes. And he gets a couple of attacks if I don't attack at all, right? So that's good. (screams) Okay, Trinket gets two attacks because of bestial fury. Because he hears my voice. So he's going to run around and he's going to try to knock over-- he's going to cannonball into the vampire guy. Yeah. Okay. Okay. What do I add to that? Okay, 15? Trinket then comes out of cannonball and tries to bite the back of the vampire's neck. Or I do my two attacks? Okay. Thank you. He's trying to bite his neck like a vampire! Oh, shit. Ooh! That's good. 27. 11. Second floor's better than first floor, anyway. Just act on the fly like Scanlan did. It turned out okay. What are you doing? It's a good ability if you're only fighting one person. Yay! Can I get up to the doorway? Tell me that I can. But I don't get any action, then. Damn it! Damn it, Janet! All right, Trinket's just going to try to claw him. Yep. That hits him. That definitely hits him. Yeah. 11 for the first, and then-- Just the dice doubles? 13 for the second attack. 24 damage. He really just killed a vampire? Trinket claws crosswise and takes off his head with a bite. Damn it! He's a vampire! So the head disappears from his mouth, or did he still get a big taste? Yeah, you would! We've learned about vampires. We know they turn into mist. Sunbeam! You know it now. Oh, man. "Doing the chaos." He's a mist. He pushes past the Wind Wall? But it says that figures caught in a gaseous form can't pass through the Wind Wall. In the spell. I just read it. So it's going to screw up my arrows, so I was checking in. But yeah, it also says, "creatures in gaseous form can't pass through it." It's okay. Eight? Yeah. Okay. Nothing can shoot through the Wind Wall. Arrows can't go through it, it said. Which fucking sucks. Yeah, it goes straight up to the roof, it says. Does the Wind Wall go all the way up to the ceiling, or does it go to a certain height? Okay. I'm going to tell Trinket to get out of the Wind Wall. Well, he's going to move. And he's going to be very happy to see me come around the corner of that door. Where I will see a bunch of dudes up high, and I want to try to do Conjure Barrage up and over the Wind Wall and in an arc downward on everybody on the other side of it. It's like a (whoo, boom). I'm a really skilled archer. I'm kind of like Legolas. Can I get up there? Oh, yeah! Fuck yeah, I'll do it and try to get everybody in that cone. Sorry, guys. Okay. Wait, I've got to see how this works. I just throw it in the air and it turns into a cone. So I don't have to attack? Yeah, they have a dexterity saving throw. I'm casting this as a 3rd-level. What about all those guys up at the top? What about the other ones? Okay. So I can't get a critical hit on this because I don't have to roll? 16, am I right? 16. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And then as a bonus action, I'm going to Hunter's Mark. Who looks the strongest? Not you. Yeah, I want to hit him! I don't know! Vampire! Drop your fucking Wind Wall so I can hit something! Can we loot the mist? (ding ding ding) Like Scott Pilgrim? Oh, look! Coins. (laughs) Don't you get sneak attack damage? Oh, no, Grog! I put my foot on him to stop him. That's nice of you. You could just go (whoosh) and cross them off. That is really kind of you, Grog. Run away. I want them all to fall, please. Does Trinket get an attack of opportunity? That definitely hits him, though. 27. 11. That's better! Oh god. Well, I'm going to-- should I shoot at the guys running away? Yeah. Are they close by? I'm going to come down and get in range. I'm going to lightning arrow because everything within ten feet is affected. 27? No, that's a lie. 19. Yeah. And then get the rest of them? So they have to make a dexterity saving throw. That's a good question. 15? Okay, I'm hitting him initially, so he takes 2d8. They all take 2d8. 17, 19, plus Hunter's Mark on the first guy. They all take 19, and then the extra guy takes an extra five. I thought Trinket swiped the Hunter's Marked guy, though. He did. I remember you saying that. I do. Okay. Oh, gosh. I'm going to shoot-- No, I'm not going to shoot them in the back. The guy on the ground, he looks like he's in a lot of pain, doesn't he? I'm going to put him out of his misery. Oh, really? So I should get the guys? Okay. I can't lightning arrow them again, though. So I'll just regular old attack and I can only get one of them. All right, all right! That's a 19 again. Okay. 13. And I act like I have another, that I can attack him again. I say, "Stop!" Natural 20! (cheering) And I say, "Get inside now." He's standing there now. That's so freaking cool! No, we said we were waiting 30 seconds and then going in. You know what? You were amazing, we killed them, it was great. I peek around my brother and go, "Isn't there anyone else in the house?" If you're lying, you'll pay. "Got it." I go upstairs with Percy. So Percy and I are upstairs alone? I go upstairs, and I get Percy up against a wall. I turn around and slam him against a wall. And I look him straight in the eye-- And I say, "Are you all right?" Look me in the eye, Percy. "All right." I'm insight-checking him. Shit, just shit. Ten. I will. I follow behind him closely.
