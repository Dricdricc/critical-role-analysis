No! (group laughs) Are you still an eagle? Can you even talk to him? Oh, I can help you. Yeah! I can. I've got plenty o' spells. I'm gonna cast Protection from Poison on Keyleth. We're gonna go in the hole in just a minute, Grog. It was wine, I believe. Bloodline. Bloody wine, blood wine. Let's go talk to Nostoc. Of course. We already talked about that, Keyleth. She's in the mine. We'll go in and find her. Right? Lord Greyspine? While we're there, would you like us to take care of any other problems? Ooh, I like this. Well, we've discovered, in our past adventures, however, is that every realm seems to be having trouble with the same sort of creatures, coming up from the Underdark perhaps? Hieris. All right.LAURA,  Yes., ORION, ORION Truly, truly. Oh. Yes! (whispering) Put some in a bottle. Yay. Roll well. Here we go. LAURA AND Huzzah! How old is Nostoc? Just out of curiosity. This is excellent. Ball, ball - I think we did. Oh yeah, that actually would be good. Understandable. When we take a rest, can I look for Hieris? I didn't take any hit points. I'm at full health. That's right. And it was great. Okay. Oh, 25. Knock knock knock. Hi. You must be Hieris? Wonderful to meet you. I've heard wonderful things about you. Uh, from Lord Greyspine himself. We were curious. I'm sure you witnessed all of those wonderful goblins and trolls and other nonsense coming out of the mine. Weeks? So this has been happening for quite a while? And what kind of monsters have you been dealing with? Oh, we just killed one of those. Yes! Is there a particular area on that map that most of the baddies seem to be coming from? Just kind of everywhere? They are quite-- Yeah. Strong ale. Where is he now? A damn shame. I'm so sorry. Can I ask a question? Not to you, to the other guy, Matt. When we take a rest, do we get our spells back for the day? All right, cool. We're gonna take a real nap? All right, this could be really bad. I mean, we're about to put the dungeons in Dungeons and Dragons. All right. We have to go. We'll come see you again, Hieris. And we'll have some of that dried fruit. All right. I did, I already did. Yes. What time is it? Should we buy potions now? Oh, is everything open? Are the stores still open? Oh, that place. Yeah, that's what we're looking for. Let's hurry and try to get them before they go to sleep. That's what we're talking about. All right. Let's go find them. Well it was nighttime before. Maybe they'll be more-- How many pages is that scroll? Is it endless? Do you want to go with him to the enchanting place or do you wanna go somewhere else? All right, shall we all go to the manor? I think we'll do that. I like it. Ugh, Grog. Can we see any traps or glyphs that are active? Can we look around and see if there's any way to, a bell to ring that's outside of that area. Yeah, please do, 'cause I rolled a one. One, baby. I failed it hard, I failed it. I did. Cool! Hey, it's a house. Cool. Oh that's right, she's in my pocket. Hi! Can I pet her little head. Grog's gonna go. Sorry Grog. Oh no. Roll well, my brother. Oh no. Hey, we have a flying carpet! We have a flying carpet. Pull it out. Pull out the flying-- Oh yeah! It can't carry you, you're too heavy. Oh, gimme that flying carpet. I hop on the flying carpet. Yes. And see if I can fly up and over to the door. Somebody. Oh. Is that bad? Is that a bad idea? What if the flying carpet gets ruined? Oh, and you're with me. Let's both fly to the door. Oh yeah, use your-- Oh, he tried it before. Oh no. Yes, he does. To know about the magical entities. Trinkets! Terrible rolls today. What a beautiful staff that is. Actually sir, we do have a dwarf with us. We have a dwarf with us who wanted to actually say hello to-- Oh, shit. (Liam speaks in Swedish-accented gibberish) But we fight well. I wink twice. Make a persuasion roll at disadvantage. Damn it. If you had gotten the 20. Good call, Scanlan. Thank you, Lord Thunderclap. That's what I meant. Should we go buy some potions then? The Value of Valor, let's go find that. It's okay, Keyleth. Terrible. Please be open, please be open, please be open. Potions. I have climbing gear. That's included in the dungeoneering kit, right? She can make plants, and we'll get plenty of oxygen. That is a wonderful question, brother. We will more than double our gold if we take this mission. Less than that. Less than that. I don't like sharing. We both stand a little taller, and try to look more noble. They're expensive, Grog. Can I ask your name? Tremaine. I'm just saying. We're heading into the mines. We are going to encounter very many arcane objects potentially. In fact, Lord Thunderbrand sent us over here. That's his name, right? Sent us over here telling us to find his wares here. And we've made a deal with him that if we find arcane objects we could potentially, you know, I lost track of what I was saying, but you get the idea. We'll very much like to perhaps make a deal with you, that we'll bring you objects of arcane nature for a discount on your wares. Oh, no you didn't. Not yet. Oh, come on, no whammies, no whammies. Okay, well. 15, hm? I know, I know, I know. How many dragons have you come across, sir? Are you interested in dragon parts? Oh. (group laughs) Oh, really? What kind of dragons, actually? Yes. Maybe a moderate. Oh, let's get a few of those. Do you have any arrows that-- Okay okay okay, two for me. He's Vax. He's Vax. Nine potions then. So 2500 for all nine then. Why would you do that? I was trying to make him-- All right, 27. Do you have any arrows that perhaps have magical properties? Yes. And what would you charge for those, sir? All right, all right, I'll take 'em. Sorry, you have to watch us buy things. What is it a mess you've made? Don't say that! Wait, 42? Are you taking it off of your pot now? That's what I'm wearing. It won't fit you, it's for elves. All right, cool. Well, thanks. I did already. Big expensive artifacts. Let's go sleep and then get up in the morning and go down and kill things. I walk Trinket down into the storage area that he can stay in. I look around for something that can look like a pillow for him. I put them down and make them comfy for him. That's fine. Also, I feed him. Oh, we have bonus die, don't we? From Scanlan. Fresh start in the morning. When we could die. Let's do it! Just sleep and go. Let's do it. Oh, Trinket's with us. I just saw that, don't forget Trinket. I didn't forget Trinket. Oh, yeah. Okay. All right. Oh yeah, can I look around? Perception. I'm looking for, you know. (group laughs) Scratch marks for anything. I'm gonna look for tracks. I'm scared, I don't know which one to roll. Both my die have been rolling so bad. This one is no longer in service. I rolled a one again. A natural one. Vax and I get dressed up in Sherlock Holmes cosplay, and we say, "Golly gee, I think I see some animal tracks "over here." Everything. That goes down. We should probably go down. Let's do it. We should follow those. So we follow the corpses and see where they're coming from. No no no, where they're coming from. I thought we already went downstairs? Does that lead down probably? Well then let's take the elevator, whatever. Let's go down. Take it back. Let's do it. The two dwarves grab and begin to rotate the giant wheel, as it does you here the winch and the chain begin to tighten as it does. The platform shudders for a second, begins to lower. As it begins to lower, you can feel the actual platform shake a little bit as the whole weight is placed on the chains. I pet Trinket, calm him down. Are we down yet? Can we see out? Can I look for goblin tracks down here and follow those? Don't curse me. What am I, what is it? That I add it to? Perception? Oh sweet. Okay. Well that's good, okay. Let's go with a 17. Yeah, I see things! Oh, no. I hear, I hear birds coming from the-- I know. Can we see? Why would you do that? All right. Big, small? Oh, okay. Dwarven centipede. Wings. Is there any residue, blood? Green, red, black. Does it look like they struggled? Might as well. Should've grabbed some dried fruit. At no point does it look like the bodies ever moved? I thought I was tracking. Whoo, that's a good roll. Yay, first good roll of the night. Changing it around. Oh thank you, brother. I found him. Anybody else have to go to the bathroom? Oh no, he rolled. Oh brother, good to see you. Am I over here, or am I over here? Perhaps we could take a pee break here and proceed further into the mines. That's a good idea. Oh no, I have to go to the bathroom. What about the tracks? Do we want to step into the room fully? I'm gonna stealth. I'm gonna stealth, too. 17. Okay. Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father, who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear, her own stolen Trinket, to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable and gives expert massages. Oh, we just stealthed. I rolled 17. You didn't. You were already stealthed, though. (whispers) Oh no. (whispers) Should we go check it out? I have a passive perception of 21. Oh, no. Ugh. What direction is it coming from? I think you guys should hang back, and we should stealth over and see how many it looks like we're dealing with. Trinket stays with the group. Trinket, stay with Grog. But we can't see anything. We can see in dim light. What'd you turn into? Oh no. Oh no. Oh no! Definitely hit light now. Oh, no. (group groans) Transform back. I'm on the other side. Can I stealth against the other wall? Oh no! (group groans) (imitates thudding) Now we have two. As two slam into the ground beside you, dropping from the ceiling portion. Wait, do you guys remember-- (Matt growls and snarls) Do they respond to vibration? I forget. Can we remember with investigation or insight? Yeah, but it's still big. Gunslinger's dodge. Oh, no. I'm so scared to roll. Oh, good. 24. That's right. (whispers) They're both surrounding me even with my awesome things. Ugh, come on Grog! Hyah! I am going to shoot the one. Okay, so I gotta do my math. That's 11, but I get a plus two from my ring that I'm wearing for saving throws, so. 13. You're gonna have me do nothing wrong? Does he look confused too? But I was stealthed, though. Good call. Nobody look at them. Oh, wait. Oh, no. Ugh, please be good. We're all gonna die. You spin the barrel, go back to go ahead and fire again, as you do (imitates gun clicking) You pull the trigger for a second, and you feel a slight (imitates fizzled explosion) inside the barrel. Keyleth, don't look at them. Well, yeah. That could help, that could help. Try it. Do it, Keyleth, go with your instincts. Keep your eyes closed. Next time just avert your gaze. [Taliesin And Marisha] Oh! That's brutal. But keep your gaze averted. That counts, that counts! Oh, no. Plus one. Oh no! No! Now he's raging, too. Oh no, who's he hitting? Yeah, this could be bad. At least your rolled a one. On Grog? Thanks a lot, Tiberius. Oh, do I have to cast a saving throw or am I fine? No, I'm averting my gaze even though I'm confused apparently. Okay, good. I am not. What's that thingy behind me? No. Yeah, what's that? How high is it? All, right cool. I avert my gaze but I listen very carefully to the sound of where it's coming from. (Taliesin whistles) Let's do the one that is surrounded so I get like, what, flanking bonus or something. Lame. All right. Sure. Okay. 12, both of them were 12. But plus 11. Yes! Oh, and I get two attacks, right? Okay. Still disadvantage? 15 plus 11, hits. Yes! Oh yes, Hunter's Mark. Yes, I do. Can I use bloodseeking bow on that one? Sweet. All right, cool. So that's 15, no, 11. And then 15. (group laughs) Plus bloodseeking, which is 10 damage, plus Hunter's Mark, which is a six, which is 3. Oh, I have to add. (Matt laughs) I'm looking again, so. Trinket? Oh, yeah. Can he run up and attack the other one? While keeping his eyes down? Oh okay, well then he's just hanging out. He's protecting Scanlan. (Matt imitates bear growling) Yeah, big old bear protecting your gnome. Oh, Tiberius. Awesome! Why? That's confusing. Avoid the snail. I'm using it! Ooh. Yeah, just take him. Oh god, you're doing it, Keyleth. Yeah, let him go, 'cause it's a waterfall. But Keyleth, there's a waterfall. It's fine. Don't. Oh gosh, okay okay. No, it's higher than that, yo! That's it? Well, that was easy. I walk up and try to help Keyleth out of the water. Ah, balls. This is why you shouldn't have thrown the snail. Me? I am gonna keep my gaze averted, but I just heard it, and I'm gonna-- I'm gonna attack it. WIth some arrows. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's the same. 18. No, lying. 20. 19. Okay, good. Is this the one that I Hunter's Marked? No, the other one Hunter's Marked. Okay, that's fine. 10 plus 13 is 23. And I switched over my Hunter's Mark as my bonus action. So I add the-- oh, one. 24. Oh yeah, I should've ran Trinket up there. Ugh, it's still alive. Oh, no. Oh, no! Ugh! Gross! Balls. Oh my gosh. Maybe you should jump in that water, Scanlan. Alright. Ugh. Short rest, short rest. He is frenzying. No, look and search around and see what's in the bedding. Why weren't you stealthing? No, they're dwarves. Oh! Is that a brain? What? Go for the brain. Oh no! (Travis imitates wood breaking) All right, I can hear them screaming so I'm gonna run over. Call Trinket as I'm doing it. You, you screamed. Can I see anything from that point? All right, I'll run in further. Can I run in and stealth or is that it? I'm gonna try to stealth as I'm going in. Oh, a 20. Aw! 17, okay. Plus my stealth, which is five. I can't attack anything. I like that that's the most common quip. "Can, can you do that?" Yeah, dude. It was really far away, yo. I've got a decent speed, okay, fine. That's my turn then. Oh no! Oh, no. Can I move to where I can get a line of site on that one? Yeah. Okay cool, then I'm gonna shoot him. Oh wait, no, I can't. Yeah yeah yeah, I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do-- it's fine, I got it. I'm really good. Okay. 27. Oh, I should've tried to-- it's okay. Hunter's Mark on that guy. 11. 11, and then I'm gonna hit him again. And that's a 23. And that is nine damage for that arrow. And then the six for a Hunter's Mark is five. Oh jeez-louise, 30 plus five is... 35. Yeah. (group cheers) I do! I do. I knew we were gonna be going down into some-- (whispering) Back to the master! You're unconscious. What are we gonna do? Yeah! I call out, "Let one of them live, so I can question them." So sorry, Grog. Restoration? It's a restoration spell, it's not a dispel. Let one live. (laughs) Honk. Oh my gosh. Me? I step over, and I try to shoot the one that he just-- I stay out of the stink. All right. 23. 8. And I ask Scanlan to dispel the stank cloud. And I yell-- Can I yell out "surrender" in Undercommon? Klingon. (Liam speaks angry gibberish) Whoa! Okay. Um, eight. Eight. You're, you're-- yeah. Oh no. Oh, is this seven to nine? Sounds good.
