No, he wants to be right there. You get to have that because you took two Vestiges. Oh, good times. I'm in that. I'm in that with you. You'll hear me. Whoa, that was double ones! No! Gears of War came out this week! No. SAM and No. Because I was thinking, maybe it's a bad idea to go jumping into this tomorrow. Don't you think maybe we should wait a day? I mean, we could watch Vorugal, see what's going on, see what his behavior is, and also prepare a little bit more with the Ravenites. But, that happening, you might have to inform them that he's not actually going to have a-- Tomorrow. I know. No, he would have extra day to recover! Percy's not himself yet. I just don't think it's the best idea to jump into this. Do you go back in the morning or do you go back now? Yeah, she has the stone. Yes. What exactly did you tell Tooma was going to happen? Did you tell her to tell Vorugal anything in particular? Yes. Shouldn't she inform Vorugal that the monster is coming? The big monster that we're setting for him. Yeah, a giant ram. Haven't you seen the picture? Did you see the picture? I'll go grab the book from Percy as he's sleeping. You don't get to say roll for it! I'm just trying the big book of beasts away from Percy as he's sleeping. Subtract some, because you're still really tired from being dead! That's what we see, Grog! Oh, he's tiny! I think he would see them. What if you became a fly or something and flew down? Would he notice you? I do. And I can speak Draconic. Sorry. I didn't think about that last time. All right. Can you make me invisible? We'll pop down tonight to talk to her one more time. Hold off a day. She's going to be so pissed. Nothing?! (groans) Fenthras. Now you've got three Vestiges! Should we go, then? Can you make me invisible and we go? Okay. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us. Once you attune it to yourself-- Okay. No, he said it really terribly. Sure did! Is anybody going to keep track of us like you kept track of Vex-- Vax. I just called my brother me. I just did that. Is somebody going to be around in case something goes horribly wrong? Stay up like Kiki did before. Something very small. Like a moth, a white moth. He can sit on my shoulder. No? I'll just smack you and then you'll become you again. Right? If I smack him, it's not going to kill him, he just turns back into-- Make him a white crow. Come on, let's go. Come on. Yeah. Definitely already. 17. I get off the broom and put it behind me. All right. Ow! Fuck you! Stop it! Oh! I thought we were already in the cave. I speak in Draconic. I say Sorry, my friend rambles. My broom takes off behind me. We will. In Draconic we apologize for waking you up. Unfortunately, I sent my brother here before with our compatriot, and he spoke out of turn. We're actually planning the attack the day after tomorrow. We'll be releasing a very large fiend. The stones. We hope that you will inform Vorugal that it's going to happen. He'll head over, fight-fight-fight. He becomes much weaker, we jump in, fight-fight-fight. Yes, Skork. I remember him. He won't be in chains, exactly. Is that all right? Oh, okay. Good news. Good. Great. That's all. Be pleased. We will see you in a couple of days. No it's not. We're not. Let's just go. Again, I apologize for my brother. He's an idiot. Okay. You make us invisible? Is Pass Without a Trace still active on us? It's up to an hour. Thank you. I thought we were invisible. We're invisible. Okay, stealth checks. Plus ten to whatever you roll. 36. Get the fuck off my head, you piece of shit. Aw, I thought you were serious. Give me the bow, right now. I'll think about it. Thank you. She did! She said she'd wait. Yeah. Oh shit. Day's coming. We didn't sleep! We need to sleep! What if you take the stone, pop over to her, then use Tree Stride and come back? Oh shit. Dice jail! Oh my god, Matt! Why are you trying to kill her right when she gets here?! What just happened? That's great! Oh shit! Grog! Open the door! Dust of Tracelessness! Out the door! Right now! Close the door, Grog! That might be smart, actually. But we're also up high and the ravine is down low. That could make a difference. Oh! I understand. We don't want that. Those chicken candies? What is this? So we don't just look like cows. LAURA and I have not seen very many animals, I don't think. Is there a snowstorm? Does snow get thrown up to the wind? Behave like wind, you guys. That is so cool! Sure you're okay, Grog, that you don't have the dagger? I know you wanted it. Which he probably can't. On me?! What about me? I was looking straight at him. Perception? 20. (sighs) You piece of shit. Dexterity. 28! 30! That's pretty cool. I'm wondering if the mist form would not be better. But the animals are really cool. If we're not all dead come tomorrow. Maybe scout and then go back. Because mist form stays for eight hours, so at least that way we can communicate not next to Vorugal. Do we look natural? Do we look pretty obvious? It could if you wanted it to. Yes, we did. I'll lead the way. I'm going to keep an eye out to make sure nobody seems like they're-- especially towards Vorugal's plateau to make sure he's not there. Perception is 30. 15. Towards the summoning circle. Okay. 16. I look down towards it. Does it look like anything is around it? Oh no! Tree's down! It is so pretty. I would be looking for Vorugal too, though. Natural 20. All right. Can I float down and get a closer look at the weird marks you were talking about? 13. Behind those rocks right there? We're still wind. Ask about what the rock is, so you can find where to dig. She might be with us right now. She's here, or it's Thordak. And ice dragons burrow. I remember that much. Somebody that can turn invisible has to go get her. Yeah, but she can't turn into mist, so you can go get her and turn her into mist. It's a little bit of light, but we can hide behind something when she does it. She can poof from within the mansion before you make the mansion. But it's daylight, so it should be fine. Why don't you go with her? Well, we've been talking, so I'm going to say yes. I've been keeping an eye out, but yes, I will keep watch. Is anything watching us? 28. I think we should all be mist, though, while we wait for them to get back. Just in case. Did we see him go in the air from where we are? 20. I come out of mist form. Vorugal's not here right now. If you're going to dig, do it. I'll keep an eye on the sky. Do it quickly, if you're going to do something. I draw out an intricate map. Blueprints. I'm keeping an eye out for Vorugal or anything suspicious. So you can make walls. Even if she did, it has to be something not noticeable. Yeah, I can shoot from that height. Actually, after you do it, I can try to disguise it, so it's not seeable from the air. We can't do it in the middle of the stone. We have to do it at the top. He's like, "I spent a really long time carving this shit, you guys, and you're going to "be altering it." I saw him fly away, yeah. That what? He's going to get help? I guess. Yeah, I can. Back in Whitestone. We hired somebody to come help us fight. Larkin, do you have any spells you can use? It is quite impolite. I whisper to Pike. Just fucking got it? We hired him. Potentially. The white one that's here. That will be here. So this is great. Tomorrow, you pop in, you summon, we all pop back into the mansion. We're hiding in the mansion while the fight's going on. Right. So Keyleth could be a hawk over by Vorugal-- Is there any way to let us know, though? Yeah. Sounds great. Actually, can I do Primeval Awareness and search for dragons to see if Vorugal's even in the area at all? Mansion. Right now. And run into it. Seriously, get in the mansion! Right now. He can't know that you know. What if he sees you, Percy? I'm better at hiding myself. A lot of white. I could always bring you up on the broom. Larkin is Raishan. Really? You're the last one to realize that? No! Yeah. One last thing. That's okay! MARISHA and Feels good. (gasps) You're immune to poison on this?! I got two tens! I got an additional 20! Now we sleep. As I am going to sleep, I want to inscribe "sinaeth" on Fenthras. Yes. I can't cast Pass Without a Trace on him from that far away. Yes, but that's only tracks. While we're over there, before I go over to my side, I'm going to try to cover his area with Natural Explorer and try to hide him. I have climbing gear. You can use it as a grappling hook, maybe. Does that work at all? Ten. I don't think that matters. Have we left? Are me and Percy outside already? Make us all white Ravenites. Sorry, I meant so we blend into the ice, not so that we're white. That sounded so terrible. I meant so that we're the same color as the ice and we're camouflaged! Like chameleons. Who all is leaving? How long does that last? 18. Bundle! Is Vorugal back? He's back. Do we see Larkin around? Well, maybe if we cause enough of a ruckus as soon as we release him. We need to make a lot of noise and then release it. Attract attention, release it, hide. Whenever we want to. Vorugal will come when we make a noise. He'll come over here. No, she told him that it's coming, I don't think she's telling him a specific time. I walk over. Give us 30 minutes. And then do it. Percy? Up? All right. I take Percy up top. I try to move some snow around and try to block it. Don't say that again! Yeah, can you make us invisible? Can I fly up and see if I can see Percy before I head over to my side? I don't want to go too high! 17. 32. Shit. I dive back down and try to cover him a little bit more before I head over to my side. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on myself as soon as I get to the other side so I can stay stealthed on my side. On the other ledge. Yeah. I'm trying to hide myself. Yes! 32. You know what, I want to pop Trinket out. I want him to be in the mansion with Pike and Grog. Go! Hide, Kima! Oh, she doesn't have an earring. Keyleth, shouldn't you hide in the mansion? Shouldn't you hide right now? Just be out of the way until Vorugal-- We've got eyes on. We're above. Just go hide. Do we see him in the sky at all? 19. Scanlan! What are you doing? Cast it! Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh no, he's so big! I hope we can take it and it actually does damage. I know! This feels like more like playtime than anything. All the action figures bam bam bam! While this is going on Percival. If Yenk dies really fast, what do we do? Oh fuck. Oh, that's great! He hasn't burned through any resistances, though. He's on the ground. In the dragon again. (laughing) Four! So you're on Vorugal right now? You have wings. 13? That's worse than it was before! Can I see all this happening? I'm going to take an arrow and shoot it. I can see the door, but it's not going to register on a magical door, is it? Fuck. Me? No, not yet! They can't hear you, Percy. I can hear you, but they can't. Try and ground Vorugal? Try it. I guess as soon as I see everybody run out, I would start attacking. (yelling) Yes! Oh no, what are you looking at? Did I ever get on the initiative order? It would be insane. Yeah, a zero. That's okay. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on Vorugal. Okay, so I'm hidden, technically, so I get sneak attack on him, right? Okay, so I'm going to hit him, or try to. That is 34. 30 points of damage on the first hit, and two of those are lightning. 22 on the second, two of which are lightning. I did. I'm going to hang out there and duck down, if I can, behind my little outcropping. Hey, Matt. Do it, Keyleth! It doesn't count on the floor. Maybe it's like Hex and Hunter's Mark. Who's doing a Blight spell? SAM and I do. Poor Kima. Trying to get mind-wiped so many times by him. Oh, you have three daggers still? Okay. I'm going to try to hit him a couple times. My moves are really intricate. 25 for the first one, and I'm using Blazing Bowstring on this. Okay. (counting) Oh! Okay. I have 40 points of damage on the first hit, two of which are lightning, seven of which are fire damage. And I get sneak attack because Vax is on him. It's Fenthras. And then 25 on the second hit. No, that's just to attack. Oh, jeez Louise. (counting) 23 on the second one, with four points of lightning damage and two points of fire damage. And I'm going to use my bonus action to hide. Pass Without a Trace still on me? Right. So that is 27. Do it towards the front of Vorugal, so it doesn't hit Vax. LIAM and Oh, do you even have to roll the attack on that? It's 8d6? What's Yenk doing down there? Sleeping? It's that new damn gun. Its sight is all shit. The three of you down on the ground. Good old Larkin! Don't you fucking ditch! Don't you ditch out! She's going! She's doing it. She's so teeny compared to him! Would he still look like a little dragonborn? It did. It did the fire damage against the dragon. You get an attack of opportunity! How do you want to do this? Okay. So that's unconscious. What the fuck are you doing now, Matthew? Are you unconscious, too? All dice are doubled? Is that how it works? I know, and he kills everything. Did you add your ten to the final one? It was 38 on the final. Can we see a little spire poking through its belly? You can be a coward, Scanlan. It's okay. Four, Scanlan! Get somewhere safe. That way, you can keep helping her. Oh, does he get an attack of opportunity on you because you fly by? My boyfriend! Fuck. I'm going to try to get his attention and say, hey, stupid! And then I'm going to hit him because that's all I've got. 22? Do I have sneak attack on him, at all? Marisha is next to him. So no sneak attack, although I was hidden at the end of last turn. (counting) 28 on the first. That was damage. And then the second attack hits. It's a 31. (counting) 1d8, plus eight, plus two for dragon, plus Hunter's Mark. 24, with two lighting damage. The first one had four lightning damage. (sighs) I want to help, I just don't know what I can do. That's all I can keep doing. I'm going to use my bonus action to hide. Like an asshole. 13. Can you Grasping Vine them through the mansion door? It's open, right? Kick him on the way up, and then he'll follow you. Blight spell. What does stone's endurance do? Plus ten. Well, one. Hopefully. What did you get? Greater. Can you Dimension Door and then run with her? He's at two failed. Pike's at one. We can still hit him with the ranged? Okay. I'm going to hit him twice. 27. 25 on the first. The second is also 27. Oh my god. I want to see a cut on his stomach where Yenk left a hole, and I want to go straight into his heart. And a tree grows out of his guts. I fly down and cast Cure Wounds on Vax. Get inside, now. I'm going to fly over and try to help Percy, now that they're safe. I land next to them. Oh my god. Let's get inside. (offscreen clatter) I stay out, and I search more around Yenk. Did you see how weak she was, compared to Vorugal? I take an empty potion bottle out and get some of Yenk's blood and put it in the cold. Thank you, Loot Crate.
