Creepy! What are these? These shirts are in the store right now! And the color, and they're so soft, I'll be petting you guys throughout the whole night. If you have the Gilmore shirt, it feels like the Gilmore shirt. Also, the Critical Role dice are coming back in stock very soon, but they are on preorder right now in the store. You can go in and get on that. We also have the CR enamel pin back in stock, so you can check that shit out in the store right now. We'll wait. We're all going to say it. Oh my, what? How? Why? (laughter) I've never realized how large-- Wow, it's bulging. Those are some bulging eye sausages if I've ever seen them. Have you noticed, the guys turn into girls so much better than the girls turn into guys? I mean, we look so terrible turning into-- You have to have your hair pulled back. Really? Yeah, definitely Brad Pitt. And she'll just yell it out during the break. Travis makes a really ugly woman, though. I turned one of your pictures into a girl. I never should have done that. Wait. What? What? You don't look like-- With a lot of makeup, maybe? I love it. Just say what we did, what we accomplished? Because that's what I want to do. Yeah. Oh Grog. I heard it happen. Oh my God. What the actual fuck is happening right now? Yeah, but you could still die. Oh my God. Oh no, what did he pull. What did he pull? Oh no. Should I turn it? Do you know what that is? Oh no. Is it amazing? Did he get something really good? Oh my God. He got two wishes? Wait, wait, I have a question. Once a card has been pulled, is it gone from the Deck, or does it go back in? Oh my God. Verifying that he did the right thing? I know. Yeah. The best card is fucking gone. It is the best card, isn't it? Thank you, thank you. Hey, man. Yeah! What's going on, Matt? Fuck. That's amazing. Oh no. Oh, Jesus! We're not even there! Fuck yes! Yay! That's a big fucking deal. Yeah! Yeah! No, no, no, we left Fassbender with him. No, no, no, we left him with Wilhand. It was that dick. He was technically his. Yes we did! It's called-- well, this was Tary's idea-- it's called the Slayer's Cake. Delicious Sun Treats. Obviously, yeah. Let's just fuckin' do it! (laughter) That's right. That's why we did it, 'cause we wanted to help the economy. MARISHA AND I mean, I guess we can, yeah. All right, well, I spent my beginning of the year trying to find the baby of the Grey Render that I sent on its way. Mortally. Very angry. I did not. I failed miserably. So many shit rolls! Yes. I am on the lookout in case it comes close to our territory. I want to keep our people safe. But I'm not going to go and try to kill it just for the shits. Yeah. I also built my house! Yes! New house, new house! And built up the guard. And I made a nice little animal sanctuary for Trinket, a nice garden area for him to hang out in, and other wildlife should they so desire. Oh, and Tary, Tary moved in. And I have such a large house, you might as well just come and live over here, right? Of course, darling! No, no, no, you'll have your own room. You're wonderful. Oh, you! And I became, for Whitestone, the ambassador to Syngorn. So I'm working on making a Teleportation Circle, is that what they're called? Trying to make amends, to make peace with my father, trying to forgive and grow and move on. And while Tary was living in the house-- Oh my gosh, just doing so many things, we decided to make armor out of Vorugal, so I have new white dragon leather armor that Tary helped me enchant. Actually, that Tary enchanted and I hung out with him, for five months, while he did that. Yeah, that I'm really good company, basically. And Trinket gives amazing massages. Yes. I think that's pretty much it, outside of the bakery, which has taken up a lot of time, really. Yes! I spent a fuckton of time! I'm building up my library in the house, so I spent a lot of time researching Orcus and the Raven Queen and learning everything that I can about all of them. All of them. Ooh, that actually could be pretty tight. Like those elves in Dragon Age. That's super tight. Oh, did you really? Oh, that's great. That's so cute. Yes, we did. Eh, it's whatever. Yeah, there's finally this feeling that we don't need-- at least, for me-- his approval anymore, which is very nice. How fucking cool we are? Just so fucking cool. Thanks for the note. I made friendship bracelets, she worked on her alchemy. So-- It looked so good. What's his official title? I like it. (laughter) And Tary. They integrated rap, too. It was like-- Yeah, it was like a whole new way to tell history. It was just so good. Yeah, I know. I want to know. He didn't want to go! Yeah, he had things to copy. That could've happened? Ooh. Very tall and slender. Yeah. But didn't it feel good, Tary, to get your hands dirty? I've been a bit obsessed, I'm sorry. I've seen a wolf, out and about, but he seems to do his job well, and I'm not going to stop him. Yes, quite. That you... never mind. (laughter) Just a little hole. But you're making some, with the bakery. Don't you have those, too? Sneaky sneak! You know we have a fucking flying carpet? That's pretty fucking cool. (laughter) We were leaving from Whitestone because we'd all gathered there for-- That's really beautiful. Just right in your skin, Grog. Ooh, I want to make mine my hairpiece. You're a world-class enchanter. Oh, that's profiterolos! It's very shiny. Fabulous. No pants? Okay. He doesn't smell as moldy after a year. That's right. (sings) Shamal. (laughter) Oh. What do we do with a vacation? I think we're supposed to just hang out and lay down in a hut and hang out on the beach. Well, yes. Yes! This is Vox Machina's vacation. I'll helm. Okay. Yeah. Oh, ah! Okay, well-- It doesn't matter, I rolled it. (hums) 17. A couple of weeks, a week? Something like that. Ten days is really good. I know what he's about to do to me right now. I know what Matt's going to do. Ten days. Oh! Well, seems-- and food is included, I'm assuming. Where would we go eat? Do what thing, darling? Friends of J'mon Sa Ord. Of course. Well, 1500 gold it is. Oh shit. Oh my gosh! All right, nice, Pike! This is amazing. I'm already, I'm in love with this place. No, just get drunk and hang out on the beach. Yeah! Roll for fucking putting on swimsuits! Grog! Grog! Lift me like Dirty Dancing! (laughter) Oh shit! You're supposed to hold on, Grog. Never mind. Yay! Let's do it! Do we see any mermaids? It's okay. I want to find pearls! Investigation? Oh, that's good! 22. Are you feeling Lucky? I know, right? I rolled 22, as well. I don't want to sell it. I just want to have it. It's pink. Yeah, I know. I feel like he said Taryon. Oh no! By your head. We have the same room. Just the beard? Some razor blades up in them. So cool! Oh, it's for both of you guys? Oh, I thought it was 120 each! That's not bad. I mean, that's a lot. No, she owns the business so you don't have to do as much. That's way different than I expected. Imagine what that'll look like when your hair is down, too, because it'll be like blue all over the top and all mixed in everywhere. I think just eat a nice dinner and then head back to the rooms and get ready to wake up in the morning and do all the same shit again. What is that? I open the door. Just fucking on guard. What the fuck! Who did this? Grog! And I take off running to his room. Did you have anything to do with this? (laughter) The fucking dogs. Grog! I grab him by his beaded beard and drag him back to the room. I open the door and throw him in. Did you do this? Is this your fucking dog? (huffs) True. (laughter) (laughs) That's good. What does our room look like? What does our stuff look like? Is it ruined? How did they even get in? I take off to the front desk. (laughter) Who-- Hi. Who was in our room? Did you send anyone to our room? Who was it? (scoffs) How? Why? Vax! And I take off running. Vax! Where are you? Where are you? Ooh! I sprint and I-- Trinket, off with me, we're ready to fucking fight. He's out of my necklace and we're taking off towards Vax's room. You are dead. Keyleth. Put some clothes on. Not you. What the fuck did you do? Why the fuck would you do that in our room? Destroyed it. Did you-- Did he-- Did you-- Why would you? The dogs. Shit and piss everywhere. I know you were in our room. Ooh. I just yank your hair as hard as I can. Why would you do it? Why? Dogs. Shitting and ruining everything in our room. Don't you lie to me. They're not even magic dogs, they're just dogs! Can I roll to see if he's fucking telling the truth? 18. I know you were in our room and I know you're lying to me. I just yank him out of the room. Trinket! Sic him! (laughter) I have the back of his head. I have his hair. (gasps) Your strength is double mine? Versus my strength? Oh. Motherfuck. Ugh, it was almost good. Six! Oh, he's got 40. Oh. Don't fall for it, Trinket! Why would you do it? It's such a beautiful vacation and you ruined it. You ruined all of our things. Vax, you let two dogs loose in our room and they shit and pissed all over everything, and our bed is ruined. They were fucking in our bed! Then what did you do? I know you were in our room. I know you're lying to me. Why would you put Taryon's armor in our room? Wait a minute. Did you tell Tary? So Tary did this? Someone let two giant dogs loose in our room, and they destroyed our things. Just destroyed it. And now, on top of having everything ruined, we're probably going to have to pay for damages. Which will be coming out of your funds, by the way. Well, then Keyleth. Trinket, stay on him for a while. Just for a while. Feel free to relieve yourself. (laughter) Just a little time. And I walk. You got pissed on. Where did you have beef jerky? I'm just wondering-- Percy is. Yeah, I want to go knock on Tary's door. Do you have Doty singing to you again? I shut the door. I didn't, Goldie. Actually, did you happen to set a couple of dogs loose in our room? Oh, you did? Yes. Well, you also got me back, and actually, it wasn't Percival, it was my brother who did it. Stole your armor? Yes. Yes, and you believed him over your two best friends? You should've! Tary, you know I can't stay mad at you! I don't know-- Thank you, dear. Oh, it was disgusting. I know! Trinket peed on him. He also dropped a loaf, apparently. Of course I do, dear. Have a wonderful night's sleep. I'll send Doty back when he's done. I'll check it out and I'll let you know. You're the man to call. (laughs) Oh god. Oh yeah, no. We have coins. Oh, Melora. There you go. Wait, but what is what? That is fate. Helping us. Was that another 20? Oh, I get my circle! Hey, guys. We can go to Syngorn whenever we want. Tight, right? Probably not! It's going to be a while before you guys call again. Obviously. Creative input. Are any of us with you? That was amazing! That was even cooler! Oh, I don't like them at all. We've got you, darling. Have we caught up with them yet? Well, you know, days might be more-- God, she's so weird. (laughter) Trip coming up. She doesn't actually live here. (groans) I bet she's at the helm! I don't like her winking at Percy! (silly accent) If you could get a close-up, you would see all of the Vox Machina's made of a different weapon that Vox Machina uses. Do you want to grab any of the last bit of pastries for the day? Obviously, free treats today. Free treats today! Just today. Just today, free treats for the family. After that, no free treats. Does it look like he really needs that cane? I think it looks like he really needs it. I do. I feel really terrible. That's how we do it in Whitestone. You have to hunt if you want to eat. That's how we do it here. Well, hunting for any kind of meat. Pastries you pay for. I want to whisper to you as we walk back to the house don't give them any more free things, all right? Yeah, they're great. They're wonderful, but no more free stuff. Just today, but no more after that. Of course not. You're so generous. I love you so much. You don't know. They're staying in the castle? All the good silver is hidden. Hidden up high. I'm just going to pop into the kitchen. And tell the staff in the kitchen obviously, you can make whatever you want. I'm just hoping maybe you don't make it too tasty tonight. Nothing too extravagant. You know, nice, but average. Right? Nothing great. Thank you so much. Lots of salad, lots of very dry, hard meat. Turnips. Lots of turnips. Yeah. (groans) No! No. Tary! Ugh. Okay, look. All right. If your father came, and you dislike him very much, right? Oh shit. Okay, bad comparison. These people suck. They're mean-- Tary, dear. Darling. They don't treat her very well, and they'll use her, and they'll stay here and keep taking advantage of her, and we don't want that. Well, that's true. You can practice as much as you want over the next couple of days, but we don't want to impress them. The more they like it, the longer they'll stay. Really? Thank you. Spaghetti-Os. I come up and I give her a hug from behind and say We will never judge you for your blood, dear. Of course not. They're great. They seem wonderful. You got more Courage? Oh, that's going to feel good in this area. I thought you asked-- I take a big spoon of peanut butter. You're sure you don't want to join us, Cass? She's still here? Trish. I'm reading their lips. I can do it, dear. I would love to. I think your cousin wants to speak with you. Yes. Be on your guard, dear. Always. Ogden, would you like me to help carry you, or are you all right to walk? Of course you can. Feel free to lean on me, though. All right. I put my arm down so he can put as much weight as he wants. All right, and I start talking to him on the way to his room in Undercommon. And ask him How long have you guys been on the road? Always? Peanut butter and pork. I couldn't help but overhear you talking to Pike about dreams you've been having. What kind of dreams? Like what? Well, that sounds terrible. Well, that's good. I would like to stop it, as well. We all love Pike very much. Can I insight check him? That was almost. 21? 21. Yes! Well, Ogden. Are you all right getting into your bed? Do you need any help with that? Well, of course. I hope you know that we're here for you, with whatever you need, as long as we're all here to help Pike. We love her like family, as well. Yes. Dark tidings. Are we talking like falling into a pit or are we talking like-- I'm going to walk him to the bed and maybe like-- I'll crouch down and start untying his little boots. I don't mind. What kind of dark things are we talking? Do you see the shadow in your dreams? Does that sound like the smoke demon that we saw come out of Percy? Anything like that? All right. How long have you been having these dreams? Have you ever witnessed it happen before? Have you had the dreams about anyone else? And they died. Really? And do you know who it is the Trickfoots slighted in this myth? I wish you a dreamless sleep. And he's out. (laughter) Ooh. I know, right? It did sound like you were fucking flirting. I come back down. I had no valuables on me at all. I check my hair to make sure my brooch is still in it. I mean, you're quirky. He does. He was listening in. I actually talked to him a little bit about that, as well. Yeah. He said that there was a thing in your family. A blood curse. He seemed honest enough when he was saying it. Said that people paid the price for a slight someone made a long time ago, and certain members of your family are cursed, and he's had these premonitions, these dreams, before. It was his brother who passed away a long time ago. Have you heard about this? Wilhand never discussed it with you? Maybe we should ask him about it? Yeah. Maybe while they're taking a tour, we bamf to Westruun for just a minute. Some of us can stay. Split the party! We'll try to keep it quick. In and out, ask him a few questions. No. Ogden's had a hard life. Maybe you could do the tour together? Oh! That is actually a wonderful idea. Quite distracted. Wait, you're not going to be here next week? Cool. Oh my gosh.
