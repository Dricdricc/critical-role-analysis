Yeah! Boggle! It's stupid! Oh my god. The pre-orders for the Keyfish t-shirt start shipping tomorrow. Outside of that, just go to the shop. Y'all know the drill. That fast, huh? I'll be behind him. Can I cast Pass Without a Trace so everyone around me gets plus ten? Yes, I did! I'm going to give the Blessing of the Trickster to Fjord. 32. Yeah. (pigeon cooing) Switch that fucking dice out! Ooh. Ruby buttons! Leap out of the way! Aw, that's sad. What did you find, what did you find? Two whole rubies? Whoa, what did they look like? Ooh! Ooh! Is it like our little mini Yasha bust? I try to feed the ruby to the snake head. Do I see anything cool about the rubies? Do I also see the little (scratching)? What thing was given to you? Who's Nila? Nuh-uh. I mean if Avantika thinks it's okay. Does Captain Avantika think it's okay for us to take ten minutes? Okay. Hmm, we should ask Fjord before we do that. I'm still picturing you in the stripy sailor outfit. Shh. We're whispering. We'll be quiet, we'll just stay still and look around. Pass Without a Trace still going? It goes for how long? Okay, yeah. Oh, Blessing, who needs a Blessing? 22. I'm really tasty He's good. Nein! 12. Yeah, it's Jamedi. Like their arms but their legs are just-- I have a question. With my medicine stuff, would I know anything that would help get rid of bugs and stuff? That would keep bugs away from me? Oh no, a natural one. What are you saying? Are you talking to yourself? Oh. What did he say? What is it? What did he say? Okay. Okay! Should we do a dance? I mean, we did a really good one before. So yeah. We could do that for them. Yeah! And Jamedi. I'll get Jamedi. Hey, Jamedi! Can you come here for a second? I have something I need to show you. It's really important, though. It's super important. Ooh! 22. Come here, come here! Okay, now that we have you two together. Okay, we'll do this very quietly. Yes, and it was specific when we were on really important missions and stuff. Well, so you have dances, though? Did you do to raise morale? Do you and Jamedi do one together? Oh. We're just showing the dance, is all. What does that mean? What does two mean? (whispering) Oh. Okay! Arm snakes? His arm snakes?! Do you see anything glowing on any of the snake people, though? Some people got venomous bites. (whispering) Jamedi! Are we following them or are we going a different way? Good. They eat lizard people. Did you see his arms? Oh my god. Imagine if it was his legs. How would he even walk? Yeah. Did they leave anything on the ground? Did they leave anything? Did they drop anything? 11. I take some teeth. Okay. I have a spell that I took this morning that will cure poison, but I don't have anything that protects from poison today. Do we have to keep whispering? Can we pretend we're still whispering, but let's not actually whisper? What if we're in the middle because we're so heal-y? We should have somebody keeping an eye behind. Did you notice the snake people came up behind the lizard people? Avantika's in the front? With you? Whatever. (laughter) Jamedi, what if it was his dick that was the snake though? Probably. Caleb, if you do the bubble thing, can the insects come in the bubble? Can you make it? Okay, then do it please! This is where we're camping though, yeah? But remember that you can hear through the bubble, remember still, though. Okay. So we can't talk bad about them, though. But do it like, "Do you want to stay with us?" but do it like this. Yeah. Captain Avantika and Jamedi, did you want to stay with us in the bubble? It's stinky in there, but if you want to. It's whatever. It's a little bubble. It's like a tent, basically. Mm-hmm. Great, cool. Do you want company? Do you need anyone with you? Okay. Beau! Nott! (whispering) Keep an eye on them, okay? Let me know what happens. Shut up! I mean-- Yeah, just-- forget it, let's go. I'm watching his back! Can I help? Does that make it easier? Okay. Nope. One! I'm not very observant today, okay? I've got things on my mind. Like he's gone? He's just gone in front of me? Oh no, don't make that sound, Matthew. But he's not poisoned? What do we do?! Oh no! I don't know if we're very far. I don't think we're very far away. This is really cool, though. Oh god, it's so scary! It's a leopard with snake heads! I need a Turkish delight before I die. No! Stop! Look at all the powder falling off. 13. Okay. So I can see that, huh? Well, that's good. I thought he was like on top of you. Won't he get an attack of opportunity? If you get poisoned, I can un-poison you! We're the stupidest. Okay, okay, okay. Nine. So sleepy. Like hardcore. Oh my god. Yay! He's like slumped. I'm going to dream about the Traveler. I'm dreaming that me and the Traveler are skipping over hills and picking flowers. Can she flank it? Did she rage? Don't you get advantage because of your cloak? You could get a 20. He's getting Vampiric Touch. That means he'll get to heal a little bit. Yeah. Totally. How about Yasha? Did Yasha roll? I dream-- Oh, I spit on you with that. Fjord gets it. Keep hitting me. Oh. Aw, should have focused on the dagger. Did we win? We can do the bubble here and have this wall take up some of the bubble space, or we can be right next to this wall. I'm going to do it to you, too. We'll move over to where our bubble was before, how about that? I was sleeping. Did you notice? Yeah, he was holding his light up really bright and seeing if he could find any words and stuff. I think they might notice some light. It's okay! We're learning things. A good night of sleep will do you very well. Or snake legs or snake arms or snake dicks. Into the bubble. I bring Sprinkle out from inside my hood and make sure he was okay during that whole fight. I give him some water and some little food. I'm sorry, buddy. (kissing) Caleb-- I whisper in his ear Make it poop. Make it poop on her hat. What are you talking about? Make it poop on her finger. But you can hear things. (gasps) Oh, no. On the way-- because I got a pretty good amount of sleep during that fight-- can I ask Caleb, before he goes to sleep Hey, Caleb! Could we stick things through the bubble? Okay, just checking. I'm not going to, Caleb. Well, that was for Caduceus. Don't worry about it, okay? Of course I promise. I'm going to stay in here. Good night. 20. Have you ever seen those cat things before? Yeah, we're pretty loud sometimes. Have you thought at all about the Traveler? Do you want a pamphlet? (whispering) The Traveler. He's everywhere. He's really great. I'll give you a pamphlet. I get it out, and I walk it over to him. Here. Just read it over. There's a lot of information in there. It's really important. He's here right now. Traveler! If you're here, you should show him you're here so that he will like you even more than he already does! Just give it a minute. He has cast his blessing upon us. How long have you been working for Captain Avantika? Do you like her a lot? What were you doing before you were working for her? What's the craziest thing you've ever done? I'm from the Menagerie Coast, actually. So that far. Ever? In my life? Oh shit, I've seen some crazy shit. This one time I saw a bug carrying a piece of bread that was like five times its size and he was carrying it up stairs. Like up and then he would turn and then it would go up and then he would turn. Me too. (whispering) Oh shit! (whispering) If they stab through-- (whispering) I put my hand on Fjord's leg. Shh. (whispering) I poke Beau. Is it getting light yet? We should wake up. Everybody should wake up. We should get out of here before they come back with more people. There were I think-- I couldn't tell. They were shadowy, but I think they were like lizard men or snake men. Could you tell? Which ones? The lizard men or the snake men? We should get out of here even though the lizard men are obviously the weaker of the two. Caleb. We should get up and get out of here. Should we make the brush look like we weren't sleeping on it and stuff? You know, so that they won't be able to like-- Okay, good great. (laughter) I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us again. Whoa! What does it say? I'll be right back. Keep going. Yeah. You rolled with advantage right? I didn't. 34. Oh that's fucked up. What do the obelisk eyes look like? Eight. Okay. Oh dang we were going to pass it around. Okay, Fjord. Stare at it. Look into its eyes. Look into its eyes. Should we try to-- SAM and Okay, you haven't been around her as much, when she tells you don't do something-- well, usually don't do it-- but okay, that's weird. She's hiding that she's actually not okay. Oh no. Oh I'm sorry, I was wrong she's just a bitch. Oh no, Beau. You must have caught something from weird bugs. Oh, you got malaria! Oh no, Beau! I'm just not going to stand near you, okay? So it's got a lizard face? Not like a human face with a really long neck? Like the Beetlejuice part where his head goes-- This city without being seen? There's a big group of us. Can we make ourselves look like the snake people? What's wrong with that? Hey you two, can you make yourself look like snake people? Can you be invisible? But still we move really stealthily. I don't think she can do it like we think. Maybe we do separate into smaller groups and try to stealth it. Oh my god, okay. That's a really good point. What if we don't make a distraction. We make them look like prisoners, we still try to be sneaky, but then if we're caught, then we have an excuse. I think they will probably try to-- I think they might try to kill us and then eat us like that guy over there. Well you guys aren't as stealthy without being within 30 feet of me-- What if-- do any of the people we see walking around, do any of them wear cloaks? 14. But there are some people that look just like people? I will use my disguise kit and try to make it look like they've got scales on them. They will probably know the people in their own fucking village, though. Let's be honest. (makes blipping noises) Disguise Self! Eight. Okay, that's way better. 17. Now that I'm seeing how good I did on Beau, I'm realizing how shitty Caleb is, but I'm not going to tell him. Okay, okay. Oh. This one's from Sam! You look amazing. It's a really good color on you. What do you mean she looks bad? I think she looks really good, Caleb. Just because he's dead doesn't mean he's a bad guy. Yes, of course I am! He's pretty cool. You feel okay now? Well, now we just have to go walk around snake people and not be seen, so that's fine. But you can't hear what's on the other side when you're popping in and out, can you? Oh, yes you can! That's right, you can. We should probably get pretty snaking on here. In the middle. You guys, we should probably do it again? (singing) Pass pass pass pa-pass. I give Yasha the Blessing of the Trickster. I would say let's text her, but she's in another country, so she probably wouldn't get it. At least I look like a snake person. Because he's distracted? The other one has no guys. Okay. I follow your lead, captain. (hissing) Because I rolled a shitty stealth, that's why. Oh no. (gasp) Natural 20! Just to be clear I always thought that a T intersection was an intersection like this. MATT, TRAVIS and No, no, no, I get it. I just wanted to make sure. Okay. Ooh! Oh! No, Yasha can't-- (hissing) I cast Hold Person. Sorry, I already said it. At 3rd-level. Yes. We should tie them up and then go. We're in the middle of the street? Let's go. Let's walk quickly. I really should've charmed them instead of held them, but let's go. Grab them. Grab them; slit their throats. Is there anybody in there? Inside. Wrap them up. Okay, tie them up as much as we can and then gag their mouths. Toss them in a corner. 15. We're already tying him. Yeah. But we were putting things into their mouths. No! Wouldn't that still make noise? Cover him up! Oh, shit. Charm Person! Somebody do fucking something, because he shook it off. But wait, maybe nobody heard. Maybe they all fought each other. Oh, that's tight. We run away. I point at the manticore. Hey man, I look like a snake person! Nine. Okay, yeah, I'll try to back away. Cool. One. Oh, I-- That was a very aggressive roll. Athletics or acrobatics? Acrobatics. My dear lord! Fucking seven, but he still rolled a natural two, right, no? Okay. Okay, good. Ooh, run away! Add ten! Yes. Oh, Hold Person is a-- you're right. Sorry, I didn't realize Hold Person was a concentration. 12. He's even more unconscious now. Keep going. Let's just keep running. 19. Where are we supposed to go? Shut up, Nott! That was very good. That was really good. Get inside of it. (mumbling) Can you re-lock the door or something? Okay, we'll just shut it and hope they don't notice that we came up here. Let's go. "Hard to read." Whispers! Yes! Whoever I'm standing next to, I grab their butt. Avantika! Avantika, are you here? Oh, good, this is the bowl drinking party! We were looking for it, oof. I was like, where are we going to stick the rubies! Where do we stick their-- I don't know where to stick the rubies. Look at all these dice that fucked me tonight!
