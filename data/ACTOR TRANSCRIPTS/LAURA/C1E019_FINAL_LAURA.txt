(Grog voice) I would like to rage! Is there moldy dungeon smell? That's lovely. Why would you say that? Travis and I will be in Vancouver next weekend. Not this coming weekend, but the weekend after. But we're not going to be here next week, so yeah, should say that. It's a con. And you should come say hi. In Vancouver. Go look at my Twitter. You'll see what it is about. I didn't realize the audience chose that. 30. 30 points. Roll for Grog. I rolled 18 for me. Oh, that's good. 19 for Grog. What?! Those dice are magic. 19 for Grog. 18 for Vex. These are pretty good initiatives. (Grog voice) Grog-- (Grog voice) No, Grog doesn't want to Rage! Grog shouts out in Giant, wait! My giant masters were killed by a white dragon, which we think is here. Will you help us fight him? Okay. I am going to use Grog's dice. It is proper. Wait. Okay. That's not his, that is mine. Okay. Well that is good. He is really happy that I am playing him, because I rolled a one for Grog. I think I should not-- okay. Wait! That's his action. Does he get advantage, however, because he is speaking Giant and he's in the cold? (Grog voice) Can Grog move at all? (Grog voice) Where is he? He is going to stay there. A moment of silence for that horrible thing I just witnessed. I am very hurt. Can I get up? Am I prone? Okay. I am going to cast Hunter's Mark. On the one that took a little damage already. And then I am going to shoot him. All these are for like really large groups of people. I am going to shoot him three times. Can I shoot him three times? I'm going to shoot him two times. This was good times. This was fun, you guys. 14 for that. That probably doesn't hit. 14 also doesn't hit the second time. Oh my god! What is happening?! (laughter) I am going to run over to cover. What is that other side? Yeah, I am going to hide in that little thing and go, Trinket hide with me. That's all of it. You should avoid those boulders in the future. But he said intruder when we came in. Spell save DC is a 17. Can you add your inspiration? Add your inspiration! He can hit you. That's true! Your spell might have worked. Should I say, in Giant, (in Grog voice) What say you? Let's fight this bastard. Together. Seriously? While everybody's having a conversation, I would like to take a healing potion. Okay. How much do I take for a superior? It is, so just regular healing potion for now. Which is what, 2d8? Yay! That's good. Grog. (in Grog voice) They'll take us, but it is at our own folly. (strangled gibberish) Which translates to, take us as in lead us or carry us on your back? Wait! Can we rest a little before we go fight this thing so we can get spell slots back and heal? Can we? Yes! Yes! Are they going to fight with us? Grog? Will you ask them if they're going to fight with us? (gibberish) (repeats previous gibberish) (Grog voice) I think that's a no. I wish I wouldn't have wasted a healing potion just then because we can take some-- You roll a d8. You can roll up to 11d8, plus two for each time. What? Get some stuff before we fight a dragon, yo. (Grog voice) Grog would like to take his Chain of Returning off of one of the axes he had it on and put onto the Firebrand Warhammer that he took off of that dwarf in Kraghammer. The mean guy he took it off. Great. Oh, that was a good roll, come on also good roll. It was a one. Travis is going to be so pissed when he gets here. His flight landed. I got a text. His flight has landed. He's on his way. They serve the dragon? What? Sorry about that. Yes, Grog lights his blazing axe. I snuggle very close to Trinket. Is there a way to, like, melt the spires? (whispers) I interrupted you. That's pretty badass. Oh! No we're not in-- 14. Oh, are you like an assistant? I was just wondering. What happens if the contract that we magically signed doesn't ever come to fruition? Percy is very good at lawyering. We are very capable fighters! (Grog voice) How thick is it? (Grog voice) Can Grog run at it and try to bash it really fast? It's a hammer, which I feel would be better against ice. I feel like every dice is betraying me. No, I'm going to curse yours. I'll just leave it at that. It slipped out of my hands, but I'm going to keep it. 15 plus what, eight? Plus nine? Okay. Here we go. I don't know, with my ones as of late. Oh, that's just ten. Oh, yes, right. 13. Should we keep a little more quiet than that? 19! 21 for Grog. We should protect her. She should be towards the back. We should take a short rest so that we're going in, you know. Could you see when you were looking into their mind if it is open or if it is just a big cavern? Because, here's the thing. If they fight with us, it's great, but if they turn on us then we are going to have to fight them at full power again. I want to keep perception out to make sure that nothing is ahead of us. Okay, but this is pertaining to dragons. He is one of my favored enemies, so I have additional bonuses to tracking him and insight against him. Favored enemies! Things he would have laid down for us. Stuff like that. You know, just to see. Okay. 18? Half of a giant, right? (laughs) Thanks, brother. Oh, good. Maybe we should stay back? Good thinking, Lyra. Before we move forward, I've studied dragons a lot. I just want to say. So obviously we all know they're susceptible to fire damage, yes? This is an ice-breathing bastard. Do as much fire attacks as we can. If he could be distracted during combat, maybe. Not happy. But he'll still want to eat us. But yes, we could do that. It might be something to think about. Before we spring an attack, yes. With advantage because it's pertaining to dragons? Is that an insight check? Okay, let me see what that-- oh, that's Grog's. What am I doing? Okay, so 20 was the first roll. 20 is the high roll. Oh, wait! No! 22. It can't resist fire. What about lightning damage? Do I know anything about that? Probably Grog. He's going to be the one that's going to be up close, out of all of us. That's true. He takes half to piercing and slashing. Trinket's right there, Scanlan. Lyra! He is really, really cool! Here's the thing. If he doesn't have Stoneskin, I probably won't let him charge. Probably. See how tough he is? And he gives good massages, Lyra. Tell him that I love him very much! He's a boy! Look at his giant dick. Oh, little buddy! What does his armor class raise by? Nice. I promise, Lyra, I will let him attack this battle. It's happening. What? Why isn't my brother here? I need to check for traps from now on. Snoop ahead. (laughs) Oops. Oh, that's good. Is that Feather Fall? Nice. Okay, I perceive some more and see if I see any traps ahead of us the whole time. That would be a seven. 15. Good for you. There's a thing here. We should not step on it. I have one job on this ship! We should maybe break down this ice wall and then not walk on this area. How about that? Before we go into the actual lair of the dragon-- once we get to it; I don't know much more of these thingies there are. Do we want to go in as if we're offering it something and saying, hey, we love you, we want to bring you people, and stuff like that? Or do we want to send somebody in first and act like they're here to serve it, and then we all spring in and surprise it? What do you want to do? It wants to eat anything frozen, basically. It freezes things, and then it eats them. I don't know if they had a method or if they just walked right in. An offering. What if we laid a trap in the offering? What if we used your frag grenade that you did. Is it a bomb? Does it set off on a timer? Is it very fragile? Do we have any bombs or anything like that? Because I have a very big beautiful diamond of awesomeness that we uncovered before that I keep about. We could present him with this big, huge-ass diamond and then have it trapped with some sort of exploding device. We could put it in a bag and then put the diamond on top of a bomb or something, and then when he picks it up and like, (explosion) in his face. Sorry. But your Chain of Returning is attached to your blazing warhammer now. Can I, from here, before we go in there-- I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on him. No, are we doing that? Yeah. Yeah, we do. I am putting Percy's hand grenade inside this bag along with a diamond. Oh, it's a really pretty diamond. As long as it doesn't explode. That's true, diamonds are really strong. I put that in the bag. Are we tossing this at him? What are we doing? Here, hold the bag. Yeah. Me. Scanlan! Scanlan should definitely talk to him. Over by Percy. But further. Oh, come on, giants. Help us out. I want to make my way further up. While he's talking, I want to make my way along the wall a little. Oh no. 20! Natural 20! And all I needed was fried chicken! (laughter) A little bit further. There. That sounds good. If we unfreeze them, they could help us. And then you put it back in the bag. And then you give it to him. Natural 20 all the way. Natural 20. I've had my bow notched, and I cast Hunter's Mark while all this is going on. I rolled a 20. Me too! 25. Okay, I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow, and I'm going to attack through my Blazing Bow. Okay. Oh, that's good! That is a 25? Okay, so that is 4d8 of lightning damage. Saving throw for half, yes. 13 plus six is 19, 20, so ten. Plus regular damage, right? For my regular. 19. I know. 11 plus ten is 21, plus Hunter's Mark is four. And then plus my Blazing Bow, which adds another ten. Where did that land? Shit, balls! I'm so aggressive right now! I'm going to roll a different one! Oh my god. That looks like a one. Oh wow. Two ones. That's great. That was one attack. Okay. The Lightning Arrow is a bonus. So I am going to send Trinket. Where is he? Dear lord. Can Trinket run around and attack his butt? Oh, so Trinket can't do shit right now. Trinket's going to move, and I'm going to attack again, can I do that? We want to spread out. Can I attack again? All right, I'll hit him again. Okay, just a regular attack through the bow. Yes. 17. It was a 25 that hit before. What was the first attack that hit? Can I stealth? Then I'm going to move along the wall further. Yeah, like that. Ten. Is Trinket frightened? Okay. Come on, Trinket. No! He's probably pretty frightened. Oh, does that count as intimidation? He rolled an eight, so I'm guessing he's pretty scared. You've still got a really big dick! I'm just telling him to encourage him. What was that for? Seriously? My passive perception is 21. Just for future reference. Yeah, so roll and then add 11. Oh, that's good. No, that's damage. You do it all and then add the two. No, that's all five. Plus two, so 38 is 40. Plus anything else? Wait, plus two damage to all-- oh, but that's already-- Wait, plus 40? So if we aim at that area that doesn't have scales... Can I see him at all? And he's pretty far away? If I just try to (bowstring noise) up? And I'm at disadvantage. Does it seem like if I cast something that would do mass damage, would the giant then not want to attack with us anymore? I'm scared to hit the giant with it. Because I want to do Conjure Barrage, but I'm afraid of the giant. Exactly. So that would be bad. Potentially. Should I try it? All right, then I'm going to try to hit the dragon with a regular attack. I'm not going to do Conjure Barrage. It's 120. I don't. That's not the feat that I took. I took read lips. I'm really good in populated areas. Okay, cool. Here we go! Yeah, no. Doesn't hit. (laughter) That's better! 27! Okay. What is that? 12, 13, 14! Plus a d6, because I'm badass! Plus six! That's 19. That's not even close to 40, but it does something. And I say, fuck you! We're as far away as we can be, and I can't move any closer. No, both of those sucked. The first one was 20. 20 was the first! Matthew Mercer. Now we try to shake it off. (sings) I shake it off. I do not succeed. It's a three. 20! Why did you say the first one was for me? Why couldn't the second one be for me? Where is he? He's going to run up for the time being and hide. Give me this. He's not hiding! He's going to run up to this area so that he's got a better vantage point to run up for the next turn. He can't get any further into this little crevice? Can he run right here? That's not really protecting him, is it? All right. Do I? No, I don't. I looked it up today, yo. I don't get shit on attacks for him because we transferred over from Pathfinder. All I can do is talk to him. Well, chat, I looked it up, and I don't think I have advantage. I literally texted Matt today and I was super upset. Seriously, I thought I had it, too, and then I looked it up. In fifth edition, I don't get that. I shouldn't have even said anything, I should've just gone with you. I'm an idiot. 54 damage? What? No! Is it too big to carry? He's got a flaming axe right now. Okay, so this is the new thing. d10 plus five plus eight. Plus another-- Yeah. Yes. Plus 3d6. Oh, that's good, 16. Plus? Ooh. 21. I watch her with my mouth agape. Five times. And one more. Nice! Yeah, but it's also going to hit Scanlan. He said it so happily, too. Evil. And also onto the grenade. I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. Come on, Scanlan. Did the dragon take damage? Can I try to shake off the attack? Oh, at the end. But I was inspired by that explosion! Okay. I'm going to attack it. Oh, that's such a good roll. That's okay. It was a disadvantage. That's 27 with a disadvantage with the exploding arrow. So what do I do? Do I just roll regular? Oh shit. 16 and then 3d6? 3d8?! 2d8. That's okay, I'm going to roll them both. Okay. Six additional. Did I say what my other damage was. Was I speaking out loud? Oh no, I'm sorry, I'm stupid! An exploding arrow! I also meant to say I was shooting from my Blood-Seeker Bow. I pulled it out and said I was going to do it. I was going to shoot from my Blood-Seeker Bow for that. Can I do that? So for my second attack, I want to throw Trinket in and I want Trinket to go up and attack him. He's going to do two claw attacks, so that's 2d4 each time. Okay, he doesn't hit on the first one. But the second one, he gets a 21! Yes! Okay. Was I wrong? Oh, okay. Either way. That's 13 extra damage for Trinket. Are you unconscious? Oh no, Scanlan's unconscious! Oh my god! But you can take a potion on your turn, at least? 47. No, 47, and 1d6. 53. I'm still very scared! Ten. Halved, because he's got Stoneskin. Who all took them? Oh, the four of us, because we're assholes? You can place it-- hit the giant and the dragon. Is the other giant dead? How much radius does the dragon take up? Me? Okay, I'm going to move Trinket away. Yeah, and then hide behind that outcropping thing. Yeah. I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns. I did, and I failed it. Yeah. So I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns on the dragon. 26. That's a good question. Hail of Thorns. Okay, wait. Next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon-- spell-- range. It just hits it, but then everything within five feet makes a dexterity saving throw. Sorry, guys. Oh. Sorry, Grog. 13 for the actual arrow, plus another five for Hunter's Mark. 3d10 because I'm casting it at 3rd level. 18 for the Hail of Thorns. Oh. And then I get another attack. (giggles) This is crazy! Okay, so I'm going to-- should I do Conjure Barrage? Conjure Barrage at them, as well. Oh, you're right. So a regular. I can only do a regular attack. Okay, so regular attack. Oh, that doesn't hit. That's a 16. I didn't. 18. Oh, he's got another fucking platform? No, that was higher than 24. Plus six fire damage. Six! Creepy Zahra! He doesn't want us to die. Come on, Lyra. Killing blow. (screams) Okay, here's the thing. Did he roll far enough away that he is not within ten feet of the dragon? So he's far enough away. Okay, then I'm going to Lightning Arrow the dragon. Do I have to attack? I do have to attack regular. That's good. That's a 29. Okay, so that is 4d8 against the dragon. 14. 17. That's good. That's another six for Hunter's Mark. Plus another 11. For my second attack-- (cheering) Jesus. Please. Oh! It's 30. 13, 14, 15. No! Four. Ugh, he's still alive! Fuck! Is it his turn? 28. I'm at 28 hit points. Are you unconscious, too? So it does it back to him? 17. Yes! Oh my god, you can kill it just because it attacked you?! Oh my god. I stand up and I give Zahra a giant hug. You were amazing. Gather up all of the shit we have to take and put it in the bag of stuff. Wait, we have to harvest it special? Is it nature? What is it a check for? I have a low nature. What do you have? Can I help at all? Can I assist? Can I hold her utensils for her? Everything. We need all of it, don't we? We'll all stand and watch. Pop them out. Pop those bitches out. But you get an advantage. Yeah, that's 15 plus six is 21. Into the cooler bag. I jiggle them around in the bag. Just because. Yeah, I'm holding it. Plus another roll for advantage. Ooh, that's way better. Plus six. 23. How do we fit it in this bag? Is it magic? We could roll it up in one of our fancy robes, though, and hold on to it. And pack it in-- oh, we, yeah! Let's chisel out some of the ice. What about all this gold in the cavern? But we need white dragon. Or wait, are you sure it wasn't the blue dragon that we harvested? Okay. We have 37 dragon teeth from the first white dragon. Another one. Let's go for claws. Just her? All of us? 20 for scales. That's why we have so many pounds of dragon scales from the previous dragons! We could make three sets of armor right now. I want to get my diamond back, too, from earlier. Natural 20 for perception! Ooh! Sparklies! Natural 20. I still have like two points of health, FYI. How much? What is the color of the liquid? Can anybody do an arcana check on the leather hat? For anybody with ranged, probably. Can I tell what it is? I'm taking it! Are you kidding me? Yeah, right? What is the saving throw? Oh, we should get out. Lyra, they're going to love you. I put the bag down that's got all the stuff in it. And then we take out a couple from the white dragon, and put out the other stuff. And we've got this giant heart right here. Careful, it needs to be preserved. Nine. Lots of gold. Per dragon's tooth? Or for all six dragon teeth? That's 1,500 each. SAM and What about you, Zahra? 1,800 each. Can we insight check Vanessa really fast? Just to see what kind of person she is. 24. Which is that we're amazing. Good job, Mary!
