To get over? And sorry, Chicago. Maybe have chosen too many dice tonight. I just-- okay. That was so fast! Oh no, I chose poorly. I did. Oh no. 16 doesn't hit him? Oh no. Oh no. We could hit Beau. Don’t call it a Crick, it’s insulting, it’s a derogatory term. Because he attacked us first. Oh no! His spell is higher than your spell! Me? Oh gosh! Okay. I'm going to prep the spell Hold Person and I'm going to wait to cast it until I can see him. I'm going to move across the sewer across from Fjord. Oh no, you get cut! Oh wait, he's outside the darkness? Oh, but he's across from me, through the darkness. Oh no! Oh no, it's like Hex or something. Oh no! We have to talk to him, you guys. We're not going to beat him. I have a question, because I've never prepped a spell and then not used it. Does that use the spell? That's balls! That is rough. That was a second level. Okay, can I go and see what's going on around the big black spot? I guess I'll use my dash to go forward and see what’s going on. I'll go right there. (screams) I guess so. Oh wait, but I have a bonus action. Okay, I'm going to use-- wait, wait-- Healing Word on Beau. I'm going to cast that. Okay, so that is 1d4. Nope. Whoa. (childish voice) Three plus three is six points. Did you know barnacles scream when you scrape them off of things? No, they do, they go (screams)-- Is he still taking damage? Whoa. (laughter) Sorry, Travis. It's important stuff that we're talking about. That was good that she didn't get critted. Are you still up? I did, but not for that much. It discards itself. Why me?! I didn't do anything to you. 19 probably fucking hits. Yes. Hellish Rebuke! SAM and I'm going to say I'm not your enemy, you guy with big teeth. But I say it in Infernal, because you know. Sure, I don't know. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this. This is where it gets complicated, I've got a plus one mod to charisma. Oh okay. Great. Which is 2d10, right? That's a lot. (coo) That's a lot. Oh, eight. So four. How many slashing damage did you say you did to me? Eight, got it. Nonlethal. You get all your grit points back, aren't you excited? Bitch. I run over to Beau and I cast Cure Wounds on her. Should I? No I'll just cast that at regular. I cast Cure Wounds on you. Seven points. Is he awake still or does he-- Let's tie him up! Quick tie him up! Let's tie him up real good. But also bows are really cool. We should give him some, because he's got all these barbs and they'd be really fun to decorate. Just tie him up quick! Is anybody writing all of this stuff down? Oh, I am the inventory person. Shit. You weren't even writing it down. I didn't write down, did you really write down that stuff? Can I take his helmet off, and look at his face? Just kidding. So that's one of the things we have as well. Is it a boy? I'm going to pull his hair out of his face so he can see us. What is the name of the romantic lead in the romance novel? No, no, not my romance novel. The one about these guys. The Marrow Valley. Can I heal him and wake him up? Are you guys ready? Theo. Most people like me too, though. And I'm blue and he's blue. I pat him on his little cheek, and I say wake up Theo. Wake up. (whispers) Hi! You're not dead, because we didn't even want to fight you, but you attacked us. We are not with the empire. Look at us! Where's my persuasion? Where's persuasion? Where? Oh. Nine. MARISHA and Oh, Theo, what big teeth you have! I pull it out. That's gross. I give a pastry to him. It's good to eat. Can he understand us? Can you understand me? That's great. Devil's Tongue. Oh I do. Sorry, I was sitting on it. Oh, a resistance to charm? You attacked us. No, we didn't! You came at us with your sword out. That's important. People need to be born. Do you make babies still? Okay. And they live as long as the Beacon lives too? There's more of them? To the beacon? What do you bind yourself to? I thought he was going to answer. I thought he was going to answer! I think we should let him go. I think he's handsome. How long does charm spell work? That's great. I've got it, too. Will the beacon hurt people, though? I'm going to insight check him. 14. (gasps) Was it the Gentleman? Is he who helped you in? Ooh, that's not bad. I mean, D&D Beyond. And then you can be our friends later. He won't. He likes us, right? You won't do it? Will you promise not to hurt us later? But what if we give it back though? Oh, man. This is a really tough one. What about the beacon? I think we give him the beacon and we walk away. Maybe you can look at the beacon one more time and try to see what it is, and then we can give it back to him. Can I look at the beacon? (whispers) Give it back to him. You have it! Oh, it is? I go and look at it. (hums) I hum back at it. What does he do when we’re looking at it? Yeah. It didn't do it. The beacon wasn't the thing that did it. What? They're going to kill him, though. He doesn't like the other wizards. It was stolen from him! We should just let him have it. Leylas Krynn. Did I say it right? Nice! Empress o' the drow? Or o' Marrow Valley? Oh, right. My facts are-- So that's where you're from? Xhorhas? And the Dwendalian Empire is fighting you? And they're stealing your babies? Because this is the only way you can have babies? It all makes perfect sense to me. I say we give him the thing and let him walk around naked, because that's better. Then you can get out. We're leaving the beacon on the ground, Beau. I'm okay with this. Maybe you should stare at it some more. I pull out-- oh wait, you know what, I think I don't have full armor for the crownsguard because I gave them away. I gave them back. We don't got no crownsguard armor. He gets his armor back. But you don't have the shoes, okay? And he's going to remember us and love us. He's going to be our best friend. He can do that when he's charmed? That's what we’re doing! Jesus! I go (hums). Yeah, we gave it back to him. Don't run out the same exit that we do, okay? I mean, we just made so much money. It's in the bag. This is wars between empires. Do you really care? You mean the Leaky Tap. Oh. Ulog. Go, go, go, go. Oh, he was going in the direction we were going. No. (gasps) I'm keeping an eye on the path to make sure nobody's coming down our direction. Oh. You should have looked at it more! But wait. Is there another exit? Or is it back to the-- Oh, shit. (singing) Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up. We were scared, things were falling from the sky. Oh, I don't know why I took advantage. No, I don't want to do that. God damn it. Nine plus-- 12. Are they still with us, or did they push us away? Let's go, before they realize we were down there with the guy. Did he give that to us before? He gave it to us already, or it was an after sort of thing? He was lying. He's not giving us any of the money. I bet it exploded when he did. He exploded. What-what! I am, too. You asked for two people! Nobody else spoke up. 14. Is there a crowd around it? Can we run interference and try to trip the guard and get the thing back? What if we go try to look at the body and then we accidentally fall on one of the guards and we make him drop it and then Nott picks it up and runs away? I run up and try to look at the body. Whoa, what is that? Is that a dead body? Whoa, I've never seen one of those! Can I trip and fall right in front of the guard that's carrying the thing? I’m going to trip and fall! Right in front of him. Yeah, but now they want it, I want it back. Because it hums. I'm tripping and falling in front of the guard carrying the thing as I'm trying to look at the body. God damn it. Why deception? I'm just falling. Yeah. Oh, well, I rolled a five. Oh, man. I want to trip him. As they try to pull me away, I'm going to try to hook my foot around the ankle of the guard carrying the thing and, as I'm standing up, try to trip him to the ground. 21. Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry! That hurt my tail so much. I'm so sorry! Are you okay? I'm sorry. It just looked so inter-- I'm really impressed with how well you took down that guy, though! (pigeon cooing) Cover it up. Walk away. Am I near him at all? Can I give him a blessing? (whispers) This is a lockdown? Shit. Can we put it in the bag? (mumbling) You want to put something else in the bag? Why? Yes. A black hole and suck us all in? We're going back to the Leaky Tap, I think. Okay, and we'll try to find a box to put it in. Maybe Claudia has a lead box at her thing. Yeah, but we need one. What if they try to find it, like, tonight, though? Or even at the blacksmith's shop? Oh, that's smart. Yes, we do. I'm going to go upstairs to try to talk to Claudia. Like we had? Like Vox Machina had? Oh, where you speak into it. Not like where you hold onto it and you transport? Okay. That's me upstairs, talking to Claudia. And the spell will stop your average Joseph from coming in here. I'm not with you. I'm upstairs trying to get a hold of Claudia. You would-- Oh. Never mind, I’m not there. I’m not there. That was a really good thought. I had all the shit! I go to the barkeep. Is Claudia awake? Okay! I go and knock on the door. It’s me, Jester! Claudia! When we were over at the Gala, we saw things that were going on, it was crazy, a tower exploded and then all hell broke loose. Did you know someone tried to steal my stuff? Do you have maybe a safe or something? Because I don’t feel safe carrying around my jewelry anymore with me. Claudia, are you naked? Why won't you open this door? Is everything okay? Claudia. Blink once-- knock-- say you're not okay if you're not okay because you sound weird. Okay. But you do have a safe I can put my jewelry in now? Well, I was going to put it in my room for as long as we're here, if that's okay with you. Okay. Are you having sex? Do you want me to come in? Are you okay? You sound really weird. I try the doorknob. I get down on my hands and knees and try to look. Can I look under the door? Okay, well the first one was really good. Perception. Nine. Claudia, what are you doing? Is everything okay? Did you see the tower explode? Can you let me in? 15. Okay. Well, we were at the Gala because we were having some fun. Who are that? That's actually a really good deception. 21. (gasps) Wait a minute, but wouldn't that draw attention to the tavern? Okay. Who are you selling it to? Well see, this is why I-- oh no. Ten? Oh. Friends are good. Can I have that safe though? What's it made out of? Oh. Okay. Are those drugs? Thank you. Well, all right. Will you be gone in the morning, then? Oh no! But Claudia, I really like you. What's her name? I look down at the paperwork on the table, too. Is that what it says? (giggles) Okay. Lauren. That's a good name. I heard when we were coming back that they were putting the city on lockdown, so if you're going to leave, you should probably do it quickly. All right. Good night. Thank you, Claudia, for all of this. I walk very slowly out of the room and keep looking over my shoulder as I'm doing it and smiling back at her. Okay. I'm going to put this in my room, thank you. Oh no. Are we in a room? We should be in a room instead of in the-- Yeah. Mm-hmm. We did have a pillow fight. (heavy thud) Nott, what is this made out of? Is it made of lead? I really was trying to get a lead box. It's true. Well, we can still put stuff in it if we want to. Hey, Claudia was aware that we guys were in league with the Knights of Requital. Claudia says she's selling the tavern. MARISHA, TALIESIN, and Yeah. Like tonight. To a girl named Lauren Spizzick or something. So she said she was selling it, and I said, "Wouldn't that draw attention to the tavern, "though?" and she said no, just her. But if it does, and she knows, then maybe it could lead the guards to us, though. It might be smart, but that might be-- Wait, Horris came with us? Horris is in this room right now? Aw, come on, man. You should go to the coast. You should get out of the empire. I don't know if she's leaving town. She's just selling the tavern. Why? Are you not going to-- (gasps) Where? That's a lot of platinum. Okay, so we also got-- let's look. This sword. It's pretty wicked-looking. We also have these really super cool spiky boots. I think you put them on your feet and they protect them. I don't think they go with your pants. It's weird to see the bottom of your pants because you normally have those thigh-highs on. Yes. Okay, we also have these three daggers, which look like-- Are they ceremonial? Do they look-- I lick one, then I lick the safe. Is it iron, then? Oh, and we don't have the armor anymore, we gave it back to him. You take your pants back off. Exactly. Will you send a message to Caleb and say, "Are we going to leave everyone else "tonight and steal the big ball?" Send a message to him saying that. Damn it! I know, and I saved you! Don't be a scorpion. I trust you! I saved you! I let you have a ring. That is so cute! He will! He really will! I just want to go down there and hug him! Does he know that you think of him like his son? No, we can't out her like that. Oh, now I feel like you really will because everyone was just mean. What were you trying to find? She's pretty drunk. You're pretty drunk, Beau. Ten. Did you just fart? That doesn't sound like an escape. I hope they're not dead. Does our room look down onto the alleyway? Just tell us what they are! Just say it out loud! Just say it! You're killing me! (groans) I wonder if I have Identify I could take... (shushing) So we're doing it. Okay okay okay! This way! Bye, Caleb! You don't roll a d20 for hit points, Sam! I'm grabbing my bag! Oh, gosh! We had no time! Whoa, nice! Because that's your modifier. Aw, three. That's amazing. I feel like that was really bad. That was a really bad roll. Yes, that's the rule. Get the rest of my morning on. Wasn't there a woman who was also (whispers) part of the Knights of Requital? What happened to her? But she saw you guys. At one of the meetings. If anyone is going to turn us in, it would be her. Where's Horris? Maybe he knows something about her. Horris? Do you know where Kara is? Do you know where she lives? Do you know what she does? The Evening Nip? She works at the Evening Nip? Okay. Do the sewers lead out of the city? The manticore head. Oh, I bet it smells so bad! Oh god. Yeah, we do know a smuggler. Ulysses! Ulysses Stanneras! He was in that yellow cloak. Remember? We need a lead box. Should we go try to buy a lead box? But how would we tell him why we need it? Don't you think somebody would be asking, "Who recently bought something that would protect "against scrying?" I know I wrote it down. I'm trying to find where I wrote down Bryce's connections. I think I wrote it down in a different-- So it's got to be that. The radiation area in Fallout. It's like, get out! Get out now! And I can't find it in these notes either. Shit. Yes. --being a sister. It was Claudia! No wonder I don't have it in my notes. We figured it out! The Evening Nip. That's going to be me in a few months. No, we need a lead box, that's probably more important. Or a blacksmith. I feel like a blacksmith would be more-- Yeah. Let's go to that. Yeah, that was the first place we went. You need to take Luck as a feat again. Yes. Do you make anything out of lead? Could you perhaps make me a really pretty-- so, my mother is a big fan of things made out of lead. She said she likes the color of that metal. She gets a lot of things in gold and stuff and so she says that lead looks very different from that and she thinks it's pretty. So I want to make her a really pretty jewelry box out of lead. Okay! It's like she has a lot of jewelry, so something like around this big. Oh, so not a whole lead box, maybe like a box made out of wood and then pretty lead on the inside. Or maybe on the outside so she doesn't realize it's not made of lead? He's a good friend of my mom's. I think that is acceptable, yes. Here. Will you also engrave it with, "Love you so much"? Okay. Okay. If we give you more, could you make it faster? I noticed they’re blocking up the gates, and I need to get it to her because her birthday’s coming up. All right. Okay. Thank you. That’s a couple days. Should we check with Pumat Sol and see if he has something like that? He would be more aware of what we're asking for, if we asked for it. As opposed to the blacksmith. Okay. Just me? What is it? That attacked us, you mean. Will they be able to find it through the fancy bag? I hold it up to my ear. Is anybody trying to talk to me right now? How do we-- oh, okay. Can they hear me talking to it right now? Wait. Don’t pass it out out here. Before. Would it hear our voice, or would it-- ? What if we say to it, "Hey man! We found this stone on the ground. Who do you belong to?" What do you think? I know, and then you call the mom? Okay. All right. It's in the bag. How do you know? How do you know he's not working for the Empire? The only store in the Empire. He's probably working for the Empire. I don’t want to trust him. I had a dream about Pumat Sol attacking us. I did. I had a dream about it. This is Laura actually. I did have a dream. No, it really was. It was a dream that Pumat Sol betrayed us and he attacked us all. Anyway-- I’m just letting you know. We don't know anything about him. Anyway, I don't want to bring out all of this stuff from the assassin guy in front of him! Yes. Are you open all the time? Well, my mom's birthday is coming up, and she really likes boxes that have-- Do you have a lead-lined box? Oh, good! Can we get one of those? Probably the grande. The middle. Still out of the reach there. LIAM and What does it look like, though? What does it do? Oh. That's pretty cool. How much is your fancy box? It's probably smart, though, huh? It's probably made a bit better. She really is. She's always asking questions that are weird. She can catch arrows out of midair. That’s a lot of gold. We should buy that box? It was 15 gold. We should probably get back and put the thing in this box, though. What should we have him make? I'll buy a healing potion. Sicrulalium? What mages were you with? What mages found you? Were they with the Academy? That's right, you were talking about them before. Okay! Shocking Grasp. Did you just call him "asshole?" Should we go? What guy? No! It sounds like smut to me. You just wait. Let's go. Come on, there are things that need to be taken care of, Caleb! But we will be back because we like you so much! Thank you. Let's go! Come on, we've got to get back to the Tap! Yeah, and to look at the stuff Caleb identified for us. Yeah! Let's put it in the thing! What, like, on me all the time? I mean, I can carry this box with me all the time, but don't you think it's weird to carry around a box all the time? I put it in the bag. (laughter) How long does it take to take effect if we're all going to die? Eventually! I put my bag back on. What is it? What are they? What do they do? Is it-- Could I use that? A longsword? Did I put that down? I might have written my proficiencies-- Simple weapons! Could Yasha use that? Oh! That’s great! I hope she's still in the city, because otherwise she's going to have a really hard time trying to get back in. I don't think anyone can use it. What do the boots do? Is it kind of obvious? Well, normally you're barefoot so it looks pretty good. It makes your pants billow a little weird but I like it. Can you handle the truth? Ooh, I take out the Wand of Smiles and I cast it at her. Charisma. Now you look so happy! It's so wonderful! Oh, right. What are we supposed to do now? But wait-- What does The General have to do with-- What does the Gentleman have to do with this plan, though? Oh, that's what it was. Okay, so we go to the Evening Nip to investigate her, and then we just happen to talk to the Gentleman, too? I wonder if it's all a distraction, though, for the big stuff. Well, that was the High-Richter's house. But Lord Sutan probably went home and noticed his rug was missing. And so did he go to the guards, or did he go, "Oh shit, I was hiding something?" Yes, but we put evidence in his house. So if he noticed that the rug was missing-- He goes to the Crownsguard to report a robbery. Then they go in and they find the evidence that he was actually trying to be behind the attack that happened. So it actually is good that we destroyed the rug, because it led the guards into his house. But he-- Are you okay, Beau? It can be. Should we go spy on his house, and see if there are crownsguard in it? Do you think they would let anyone back into the Tri-Spire? For what? I am sad that I did that to her, because-- Shit. Hi. Yes, I would like some milk. Do we follow him? Thank you. All of us. Lucien?! That's a cool name! Everybody's a liar! You sneaky bastard!
