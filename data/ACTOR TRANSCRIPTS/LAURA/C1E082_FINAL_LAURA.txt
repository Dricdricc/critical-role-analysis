Thank you, Lootcrate. We're glad to have you back. So excited about it, though. Just so excited. Oh my gosh. Okay, okay, okay, I'll stop rolling for a second, because we have these new things in the store, and they're socks. (gasping) Yeah, no, these are for us. Can I just tell everybody how much I miss having you next to me, boo? I'm sad you're not over here. Oh, god. Is it really that cold? Oh my gosh, Patrick dinner. So we're just gonna choose an eighth-level for Pike, but it won't stick if she wants to not have that be it, right? Oh, so she doesn't have to choose one like a ranger? Oh, that's great. Well, never mind! Yeah, Power Word Kill Green Dragon for her eighth-level spell. Specifically. No, no. They look so good on me. Have you noticed? I know, I know. I mean, like, really good. Oh, really? Strategically, you can do more than me? No, no, no, I'll give them to you, I'll give them to you. It's the Dragonkilling sword. Oh, jeez. Who needs it? Can anybody take it? Should I do stealth cloak or should I do-- Get me out of this bench situation! Hold on, hold on, I'll pass it over to you. I'm not even going to read it, Keyleth. Okay, wait. The Dwarven Thrower, this is the warhammer. Okay. You gain a +3 attack bonus, bonus to attack and damage rolls. It has a thrown property. Normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet, Grog. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is Giant, which a dragon is, 2d8 damage. Oh, 'is a giant'. Never mind. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand. Kerrek, are you secretly a dwarf? Oh my god, let me find the fucking piece of paper. Jeez. Oh my gosh, but I don't know what else Pike has attuned on her. (gasps) Pass 'em over, Pike will wear them! They don't need attune? Wow, I'll write them down on her sheet. Okay, here's a question can she have the boots on and then right before the battle put on the Sprinter's Boots? And it's not like you can attune them and then take them off? Yeah, they're pretty clutch, especially after the last time. But we're going stealthy, probably, before-- Do you mind-- can I put 'em on for now? Since I gave him back his boots. Is that okay? Oh. That doesn't sound as cool. Grog has every weapon ever. What the fuck? Oh no, did it turn you really, really, really stupid? Is it just because it's only meant for you? Oh, shit! A god? No, go talk to the Raven Queen or somebody. Sarenrae! (gasps) Maybe she can Greater Restoration, if Pike realizes what it is. Well, I don't know if I know that anything's wrong with him. Grog, do you have a headache? Do you have a headache? Well, I can maybe do like a Cure Wounds, or-- I don't think so, but I can pray to Sarenrae if it would help? Can I-- is there anything I have? Just insta-cute. Would I know what to do? Would she know what to do to try to help him at all? Okay. I can try to do a-- I don't know what level Greater Restoration is. Are you sure, Grog? Okay. Let me know if you need anything, though. Pike's gonna try to do Greater Restoration on Grog. It was worth a try, though, because that would've been helpful. I didn't say it the last time, but Trinket's out of the necklace, and he healed overnight, 'cause he's low too. It's a Ring of Invisibility? Just a legendary ring. No, that's really good. That's a badass ring. We should have a Heroes' Feast. Is there anybody that could do a Heroes' Feast? Okay, okay, okay. Pike can do another-- what level is that? Okay, so we all have Heroes' Feast. For Pike? Oh, that's not bad, that's not bad. That's a 15 added for everybody. Fear and poison. Advantage on wisdom. And I attuned-- by the way, my Bracers of Archery are attuned again. Yeah, but what should you scry on? Can you scry on Thordak's body or something? 'Cause she would have it right next to her. Oh, jeez! I'm so nervous. He's eating wood again. Rocks and like dried poo. (sings) Allura! Kima got the Feast, too, right? Is it the same difference? That's true. Yeah, yeah, you know what? When Kima comes back, I'm gonna give her the Elven boots, so she can be quiet. If you don't want them, I'll wear them, I mean, I like them a lot. I'm just saying, you're loud. You seem different. I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us before we go through the tree. Oh, do you need me to cast another Greater Restoration? For your-- Okay. He and Scanlan both. We want to keep quiet as we do it. Pew-pew-pew! 24 for Pike! Plus ten? From Pass Without a Trace! 38. Do I see any sign of tracks or anything? Dragon tracks? Dragging of giant carcasses or just, y'know, footprints. Advantage, 'cause it's a dragon. It is dragon-related. Natural 20. Motherfucker. I bet there's other tracks, though, that I totally missed 'cause I was looking for dragons. Can I look for anything other than dragons? There won't be an advantage. I really want that 20, but I don't get it. This one is not as good. Is this an investigation? Perception? (whispers) 11. Okay. But they were little. Mm-hm. Tread carefully. Just keep an eye out. We're keeping eyes out for anything that looks different than normal jungle-ness. 26. I wasn't just looking for traps, I'm looking for anything that looks out of place in the forest, 'cause I don't know what kind of traps necessarily would be set by something like this. You know what I mean? Vax! Stop! There's some weirdness on the ground. I feel like it's something. Yeah. Don't you see it? Now that you're looking, now that you're looking, you can tell, right? Is it quicksand? Maybe it's magic. Hey, everyone. Let's just not step on this dark patch, how about that? 'Cause I think it's like magic or something, Grog. Like bad magic. The kind that would kill us all. Similar sort of thing. I know, right? And then? Told you it was dangerous. Good job, Grog. Can we see the mountain that we're getting towards? 30 is what I rolled, but that's not as good as a natural 20. But 30 is still good. Whoa, your perception bonus is higher than mine? When did that happen? Like, big holes? Does it look like it could be, like, things could come out of it? Do I need to roll, since he's so good? What if it's a one? Ooh. No, 24. Damn. It's probably too heavy for us to move, but Grog, do you want to try? Well, how do we get in if we don't open the entrance? Ooh, dig. I like that. Oh, good call. Can you just put a hole in the middle, like right in the center of the boulder, on the ground? We'd have to run around an entire mountain. Does it look like there could be any other entrances? How long would it take if I flew around? All right, cool cool cool, let's just shape the boulder. (gasps) Oh, I'm gonna try to detect dragons! What the fuck? I sit down and go, hmm. They're here, they're here. Oh, god. (hyperventilates) They're here, she's still here, and I think the eggs are okay, 'cause I can still feel like there's dragons. I think so. I just did it within a mile, so is that okay? Was that within a mile? Or did I need to spend longer? Oh, so I am, because it's woods, right? Wooded? I have to go take a poo. I'm so nervous. All right. We're gonna go in? Let's go in! I mean, I don't know if we're gonna have to go through. And it only lasts for a minute, so I feel like we're gonna be in the caves longer than-- So we're still stealthing. Me? Grog. I'm already seeing someone. What little magic thing, darling? Do I have to attune to that, Grog? You're lying. Grog, and then it gave you a headache! Grog. (yells) Grog! This is awful. No, it's so bad for you. (laughing) You motherfucker. Oh my god. You see how hard this is when people want their boots back, when people want their decks back... You did find it. Grog. You have to promise me you won't pull anything from it. All you can do is hold onto it. That's all you can do. You can't look at anything, you have to keep it in its little pouch. So, you know in Guardians of the Galaxy, when he gives him that little ball at the end? Can I do that? Can I give him a pouch? Here's your cards back. But don't look at them, Grog. They're really dangerous. All right? Yeah, give me the necklace. A little pouch that's the shape of the deck of cards. It's maybe not that good of a pouch, but it's Grog. Okay. Well, obviously! But it's Grog. That's really bad. He's gonna be able to tell. Nine? Oh my god, I'm in so much trouble! (laughter) I know. He's so mad at me! He's so mad. It's really good that he's sitting over at the other table right now. Seriously, though, they're really, really dangerous. Oh, they're yours. No, I promise. (nervous laughter) Oh, I just gave him back his cards, is all. What do you see, Keyleth? How about I try-- Oh! What if we light an arrow, can I do an Oracle Arrow through the hole? I'm getting death looks. Natural 20! Okay. And nothing had walked, it didn't look like there were any tracks. It was just heavy dust. I shimmy out. It's just a tunnel. Yeah, it's a long tunnel. Potentially. Raishan, I think, has rather good hearing. If we make a lot of noise, it might echo down. But you do have siege gauntlets, though. What do you think? Should we burn another 4th, or should we have Grog punch the little hole a little bit? What? Grog. You wanna go punch some shit? So it would just be another spell slot. Well, Grog has siege gauntlets, so he could potentially do some damage to the rock, but it would make noise. Doors! Why? And then do what? Do it! Just get us in. In theory. Yeah, that's a good call, because we have two of them, now. 12. Did you want Pike's? Trinket rolled a 19. I scootch. Can Trinket get in or do I need to bamf him in the necklace and bamf him out? Okay, that's what I do. Should we leave it open, or should we take the rods? We might need to get out in a hurry. Stealth. Oh, this is investigation. Oh, was that a stealth roll or an investigation roll? That was investigation, right? Dogshit. 11. Hey, Keyleth. When you did the scrying thing, how long did it take to get down in the tunnels? Was it a lot of tunnels before you got to the laboratory? Yeah. It's less than a mile down, I know. Okay. Should we all stealth? I thought we had to reroll stealth. 30. 25 for Pike. He was here for a long time before-- he was here before he got the thing, right? Yes? Is that the Death Ward? It's a thing. I talk to Sarenrae and then she protects them for a little bit of time. Feels a little selfish, but sure. (laughter) I mean, if you want me to do it. Sure, why not? I walk up to me. I guess Pike will cast Death Ward on Vex. Feels a little weird, not gonna lie. Yeah, it's totally cool. Wait, light your little dagger up. This gnat, this fucking gnat. A little bit of light. No, no, no. Hold your little dagger up to it, I want to see what it is. Yeah. Careful. Maybe keep it out, just keep an eye out. It's hard to see down here. No, I just, I mean for traps. Psh. 'Cause it's dark. See? If you'd pulled your dagger out, it wouldn't be so bad. If his dagger's out? I'm gonna pull out the flying carpet. (laughs) And I'm gonna walk over to-- I'm gonna give the-- Hey, Grog. So I have this flying carpet... Grog, would you be able to use a flying carpet in battle to get up to a dragon? It could be useful. Around us? Like how close around us, can he sense that? Can we see anything on the walls that looks like a door or anything? No, no. Oh, it could be watching through the skull. You're brilliant, Kerr! Fuck. Okay. I could do Sacred Flame on it, and it would do radiant damage to it. Sure. We should've come down in the tunnel wearing pantyhose on our heads so Raishan wouldn't have known. Vex-agonal? Should I make a perception check, too, since I'm near it? Oh god, that was almost a one. But it's not, it was a 15. Oh, god. What? There's ingredients? I mean, would it be helpful if everyone could see? So, Light? Should we light it up? Does it look like-- when we entered the chamber, does it look like a door would come down or something when it opened up into the chamber? Can I go look in the bowl, the bowl in the middle of the room, and just look and see if there's a residue of anything in it? 26. No color change or anything on it? Well, I don't actually touch it. Oh yeah, I get out a lockpick and scrape it to see if I can-- They take up a lot of room, though, so. Scratch-scratch, scrape-scrape. Yeah, just to see what the residue is. What color is it? This is fucking blood. Maybe we should just bleed into this bowl and the door will open. Necromancy? I tried to give this rug to someone else, but Grog didn't want to take it. There's things going on in this room. We've got dragon blood. I'm gonna get out a vial of dragon blood. (feedback sound) What is it? I put the dragon blood away. What should I do? Wait, I've also got other kinds of blood, let me see what kinds of blood I've got. Oh wait, you know what? What? Okay. Grog. I mean, sure, yeah, extinguish all the lights. I wanna go and see if I can read it. I think I need glasses. It's blurry. Nah, it's blurry. That's actually a really good idea, Grog. Maybe we should light the brazier. 22. Oh no, Kerr! If Raishan didn't hear us before, she potentially heard us now. We need blood. Oh, that dick book. (laughs) I know who that is. (laughter) Opens the door. Dragon blood is so expensive. I have basilisk blood, black dragon blood, and white dragon blood. I know, that's why the basilisk is better. One basilisk vial. Fuck. I pull out my opal dagger and I just cut my hand and drip it in. Creepy. Is the door opening? It's like a kill-something sort of situation. Oh. Well, shit. (laughs) Punch it! Okay. Pike immediately casts-- No, no, no, not that. She casts the other thing. Shouldn't she? It's undead. Holy Aura on all of us. I wrote it all down. Hold on, hold on. It is within a 30-foot radius where everybody is. It sheds a five-foot radius of light on everyone. Everybody gets advantage on saving throws. Enemies who are attacking have disadvantage on everyone. Fiends and undead who do melee attacks have to make a constitution save or be blinded. Oh my god. [break] 16 for Vex. Pike rolled a nine. Nine. Kerr. I like it. Well, don't write it off, it was 15, that first one. Did its little jawbone go (chattering teeth)? We're gonna die just from fucking-- Well, we didn't get a chance to move! And everybody's got advantage on every single one of those rolls. Wait, I gotta do them for Pike. Fuck. (sighs) Do I have to roll for Trinket, too? Oh, god. Okay, Pike saves two and fails two. Vex saves all. God. Trinket only saves against one. Even with advantage. Trinket just constantly-- I didn't add anything. Oh, well, he had a plus two. Oh my lord. I saved against all of them. So I'm at 57 hit points now. She failed two of them, yeah, so 88. Oh, thank god. Okay. That's good, that's good. And then Trinket only got one, so he's in my necklace. Already. Animus? That would've gotten Pike up to one of-- she would've failed one of them. So add 11 points back. You would've saved on everything. Trinket still would've failed three. Just to put that out there, he rolled so poorly. Even with the plus three, Trinket would not have gotten up to 13 on three of those. Oh, poor Trinket. He's just-- Oh, I'm up. Okay. I'm going to shoot them. I'm going to shoot the one closer to you. That definitely hits. 16 damage plus three lightning damage. And then, fuck me, I Hunter's Mark him. I attack him again. Natural 20! (cheering) 20 plus eight lightning damage plus eight Hunter's Mark. 'Cause you double all your dice, right? So 28 plus eight lightning damage. I move away from him into the-- oh, on the opposite side of Percy. How is this ghost so strong? Good times, guys! Check for traps, check for traps! Yeah. Some sort of healing thing. Do we wanna-- okay, if we all keep charging in, that spell that we just did lasts for a minute. Thought Raishan was around. She was not. So, we've got less than a minute left on that level eight there. You know what, they did a good job of keeping us from all dying just then, though. Natural 20, 18, 19, 11. 11. We're not gonna be able to get to her in a minute, y'all. If we take a rest, we can rest up and heal. Okay, yeah. We use our hit dice, 'cause we all got half of them back. We can scry and see if Raishan totally knows that we're here. Yeah, that's the thing. She's probably already bamfed out, y'all. Oh. Yeah, while we're resting, I'm gonna detect dragons and see if she's still around. Same spot? Oh, all right. Okay, so what is that? Oh my god, I rolled so good. I went all the way back to my maximum, so 115 is what I'm at now. That was good. Oh, I went up to 117, because I forgot I had the extra 15. Pike's back at 115. Wait, Scanlan gave us an extra nine hit points? Nine. I'm higher than 117, then I'm one-whatever. 126. Sure. So like a mansion we could have for two days. Just kidding. Oh, you know what, darling, don't worry. You can use the carpet. So let's walk up there. Of course. They do, they really do. Okay, then he healed himself while we were rested, but he's in the necklace so that we can fly if we have to. But they're only out for an hour, dear. Of course. The carpet can fit everybody. Grog and one person. So I can get Scanlan-- What's at the bottom of the stairs? I mean, can we drop people off and go back in? Let's shuttle-bus. A safe landing? Is it safe to walk into the passageway? Pretty sure we should just use the brazier and light it. I'm gonna grab Scanlan on the broom. You grab Pike. Okay, and then we'll take the gnomes and Grog down and then come back up. Yeah, I've got-- I want Pike on my broom. What was that? What was that? Sam? Scanlan? Do you think it's broken now? Can we get other people from-- Grog and Allura can fit on the carpet, right? Okay, then, oh god. Maybe, could you take, when you fly back up-- Okay, I go back up and get Percy. We have Kerr and Allura and Keyleth left. I grab Percy on the broom and come down. I feel like-- wait, I pause before we go down the stairs, 'cause I'm like, there was this blue light that happened before, and Scanlan made it stop. How do we not let that happen this time? I thought you already went down on the carpet. No? Okay. You can carry Kerrek? You're so strong! Oh my god! You've been lifting, bro! Grog. Groggy, can you come down? And Trinket's-- Trinket's still in my necklace. He's healing in the necklace. I'm just gonna stay on the broom and just kind of very close to the ground, but not touching the ground. Totally. It's a leap of faith! How long until your wings stop working? Zoinks. I'm gonna go with him. On my broom. This is why I went on the broom, I was gonna catch you. Jesus! Small heart attack over here. I'm gonna turn around and go back to the-- That was weird. It doesn't feel right. Percy? Be careful. Allura. It felt like almost I was drunk as I was flying across that. Do you know-- So can I try flying out there, knowing the gravity's shifted? Does it feel okay to fly out like that? Oh, I didn't want to go all the way across, I just wanted to test it so I could help bring other people across. Potentially? Grog, did you see how I barrel-rolled on my broom? Yeah, you should just do the same thing on the carpet. I don't know. Can I get a better look, can I look and see if I see it again? Is this related to dragons? Then that is a 21. Let's just get across here, shall we? Okay, so I wanna get a good look at one of them as they go by. I pick up Pike and try to barrel roll across. Oh wait, Pike has a thing that she can help people with their-- Damn it! She's got a plus four on strength. Nine for me. I'm tethered to the broom. You got it, you got it. I love you. Don't hah, don't hah the DM! Vine holds? Are my arms restrained? Acrobatics. That's Pike. Acrobatics. 25. Oh. My. God. Everything's fine, you guys. No, I love you! You're amazing! Can I just take out-- I just have a dagger, can I pull out my dagger and try to jam it up into the zombie's-- under his chin? Oh, it's all zombie drool! I am really bad at regular attacks. What do I add to this? So 20. Oh, plus my dexterity. I didn't roll a 20, I rolled-- Eight. What is Pike doing? I didn't even see that spell, where's that spell? So I would look down at Pike. You're amazing! That was amazing! This was a mistake. How do we get down? Can I-- no, I can't do that. I'm like floating, basically. Basically I'm like falling and just held onto a broom that's being held onto the wall. I want to try to-- any zombies or undead that come near us, I want to try to shoot them and at least ricochet. Oh my god. Yeah, no, that's the thing. Percy's on his way to save us, so you guys just try to hold onto that carpet. He does. He could do it for himself. That sucks, 'cause Scanlan could've taken Kima. That's you. Oh my god. Grog's still on the other side. Oh, no, this is perfect. This is a really cool setup, Matt, though. It's really fucking badass. The visual of it is amazing. Yeah, for sure. Oh my god. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Thanks for saving me, darling. You. Don't untie it all, I like being attached to it. I give Kerr a big hug. Thank you. Saved the day. Well, I could go over on the fucking broom again, dear lord. How about the bodies? Are they still flying? Thing is, I can put Grog in the necklace and bring him over. 40 feet? Or is it 60 feet? I feel like I could go back over. I know, I rolled a one, though, you guys. It was real shit. Totally, totally. All right, cool. Attach a rope to me. I bamf Trinket out so my necklace is empty, and then I take off across the channel. Scanlan can get on the broom. So I want to fly back over. Heart pounding, this was terrifying. I'm sorry, buddy. I wanna try to time it so I avoid as many as I can. Okay, cool, cool, cool, tight, tight, tight. Here we go, here we go, here we go. Natural 20! And that one's totally fine, too. That's a 29. Oh hey, guys. Hey, Grog. Do you trust me? Do you wanna get in this necklace? And then Scanlan. And Scanlan, I want him to affix himself to this broom, like really tie him on here. I still tie some rope around. I've got the Rope of Entanglement, I can at least wrap us up. The first one is-- I add my dexterity? Okay, that's a 26. Okay, that's good, that's good, though, this is good. 27. I untie Scanlan and pop Grog out. Move forward, I guess. Check for traps! Good, I hope you rolled well. 'Cause I rolled a one again. Like, into the fountain? Probably maybe leave it? Gross. Yeah. I stand in between. I'm scared of all my dice right now. Just, all of them. 17. I'm gonna try to focus on dragons again and see if I can figure out which direction they are. It's up to you, Grog. Do I know which fork they're down? 24. And there's a little bit of light coming from the end of it? Trap? You wanna look for traps? The dragons are still in there. Just ahead. No, let's all stay on one side. It could just be like this could be a water canal that we're looking at right now. It looks like they come back together. This is just a giant separation thing. Oh, but I have an actual coin. To the right! Check the ceiling. I look at the ceiling. Ash might be able to Skype in, too. Thanks for saving us, Kerr!
