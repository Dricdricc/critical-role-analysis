They look so cool. They're custom order, so they make them when you order them. It takes a few weeks to get them once you order them, but it's worth it. He rolled this die. It's sacred. Muscle. Yeah. Happy birthday, Sam. I have one. I got nominated for a Golden Joystick award. Yeah, for Fiona in Tales from the Borderlands. I didn't tell him. I think there's a week left of voting, so you can go and help out. Yes, they can vote for me. I think you have to register your email address, so I don't know how many times you can vote, but you have to vote in all the categories in order to vote for the one category. Thanks, baby! Trinket was down there. Don't say that! Don't say it. (worried noises) Oh no! 19. No, he's downstairs. But you're not going to miss, so it doesn't matter. Are you wearing an earring, Percy? Trinket. He can see Percy getting attacked and instinct takes over, and he runs forward and he claws him. That does not hit. That's a natural 20. Oh, that's the wrong thing. That's a 2d4. 17 damage. Does that count, if I hit it into my box and it slammed into the side? Does that count, or should I let it roll naturally? 17. MARISHA and You're welcome. I got 17. But Jarett's got him. Trinket's up! He's going to try to jump and land on top of the ghostly thing and bite its face. I don't know how to do that. I'm having an issue here. Because I have 18 in parentheses, and then I wrote a 20 and I circled it and I don't know why. 18 is probably-- He does! He's got his bulette armor, man. He's a cannonball. What am I doing? A strength? 17? Yes! That didn't count because it slipped out of my hand. That was even worse than the other one. So 11. It slipped out of my hand. It shouldn't count if it goes like that! 20. But he's gone prone. I want to run down and shoot something. Can I see anything? Can I ricochet an arrow to hit? That was the same one each time. 28. Oh, I didn't fucking Hunter's Mark him. God damn it. Fuck. 15. Now I'm going to Hunter's Mark him and I'm going to hit him again. Can I do that? All right. That one doesn't hit. Doesn't matter. Doesn't hit anyway. I missed it. I Hunter's Mark him. Jarett. Did it do any holy damage? Don't you double it? You had to double 19. Oh, right. Oh man, that's going to be loud as fuck. Trinket roars, rushes forward. Oh, all right. Then he stays there. So he's actually locked in the thing still? Okay. Can I move forward so I can see? All right. Yeah, I'll do that. I'll shoot him. He's Hunter's Marked already, okay, good. 15. 16. Yes. And then 14 doesn't hit. And Trinket, can he get up to him? Oh, but I took all the attacks. Trinket stays in the corner, then, because he can't do shit. Yeah? (giggling) You softened the shit of him. I run up and I cast Cure Wounds on him. 17. Do I add my wisdom to that? Then it's 20. What was that thing? Oh, he's faced these things before. That's what it is. Do you know from your previous experience if there's any way to protect against them? Other than setting up walls? Does anybody know how to protect against air stalkers? We were unprepared to warn you. I'm sorry. Jarett's up for anything. Well. Maybe it's best not to leave him down here. But you know what! You're still alive. That is one of Uriel's staff. In which case, we cannot talk to them right now. I think it's probably better to bring him upstairs, because if it's locked, we can't get to him very quickly. And you have my axe! Desmond, dear. Let's go upstairs. Grog! That bed needs to go back up to the guest room. Yeah, we need to sleep. 16. But my passive is 21. Motherfucker, you are sneaky! I need to talk to you. Help yourself to a frittata. Let him talk. Can I roll for insight? I know! That was a shit roll. Nine. Shit! That makes sense. Do you it's only Uriel, or do you think it's the rest of the council as well? Oh shit! They could have gotten any of us. Is it possible to sneak into his room, and restore him without anybody knowing? What if Keyleth, who can do it, polymorphed into a fly or a very small creature, traveled on you, you snuck in, she popped out, did the thing. Money. So then you go with them and Dimension Door out. Uriel, if he's got his mind controlled, it doesn't matter if we try to clear our names, he's going to find us guilty. No, they're not. They're not going to let us go. Please, we need your input. You gave them the Wheel? I didn't know we had a whole army at our disposal. That's wonderful to hear. Here's the thing. He's going to find out stuff about the Briarwoods. What's the fucking point of him going if we're just going to go attack the Briarwoods before we know what he knows? We need to let him go, find out his shit, take care of Uriel, wait until he gets back, go take out the Briarwoods-- A what? As roaches. Or bugs. Roly-polies! So they'd have to pop out. Can you shrink yourself and still do magic teeny-tiny? Either of you. Seeker, what do you think? What was your goal of coming here? That would be lovely. What about being invisible? Can you cast spells while you're invisible? It's super-duper cool. Here's the thing it's not going to be just two, I don't think. It's going to be an entire town of people that they've controlled. Yeah, but Seeker Asum knows all the ins and outs of the palace. We'd have to do it stat, but he knows how to get in. Could you distract people? It's fucking your family. It's the people that attacked your family. Do you have no contribution to this? We're choosing to do it. And then leave. Yes. Wait! Before you go, could I talk to you? Were you going to say anything else? Because I'll talk to you in private. I'll follow you out. Yes, I do. You're a ranger. You're very sneaky. I've only ever seen people like thieves, like my brother, do things like you've done. Can you teach me anything that you know to help me maybe be a little more stealthy, as well? I appreciate it. Utmost. Okay. He really, really does. Ooh, that's good. You're already 1,200 in? How much more would you have to put in? I'm training. Yes, get me some holy arrows. I wanted some holy arrows. Or holy water. Try to get some holy water. Holy oil. Yeah, I gave him gold to do it. What does that do? Do it. Get one for everyone. Yeah, technically, but still! How much do you need? Talk her down. How about we stick to the level we're at? Good job, Grog. 17 feet! 17 whole feet of mirrors! We got really bored and we left. Six days per arrow? (screams) Plus, we didn't get any holy water, we only got holy oil to put on our weapons. Don't put it in a Bag of Holding. Percy's used to unstable things. Oh. Look at this, so fancy. Oh god. I go find Jarett, and I give him 200 gold. And I say, do not let-- Desmond? Leave your side. Watch him, watch for invisible anything. Protect him with everything you can. I just gave him 200 fucking gold. And yeah, everybody-- fuck. I give a hundred-- I give another 200 to him and tell him to pass it out to the rest of the guard. We'll be back soon! And add another guard to the watch. Thank you. Shall we head out? Did I learn anything from Seeker Asum? Ah jeez, really? What if I roll like shit? He is. He's so good. (fake crying) No, that was terrible. Plus my wisdom. 17. While I'm attacking? Cool. LIAM and Dear diary. Sorry. Everyone is aware that Tiberius is the giant eagles in Lord of the Rings. Tiberius can invoke ultimate destruction at the call of whatever he wants. I write a note. Address it to Uriel, hand it to our main butler. Who I know his name. Erwen. It basically says Uriel, FYI, we didn't totally flee. We's looking for evidence. No, we didn't flee. We'll be back, how about that? We'll be back. And I tell him, only give this to anybody if they come looking for us and they're angry. I think it's in the Cloudtop District, actually. Oh yeah! Let's do it! After I haggled. Because let's be honest, I would've. 21. Yes it is. All right. (gasps) You made a map? Wait, where is Westruun? Oh, there's Westruun, that's where we are right now. So we have to go-- I just spit on your map, Percy. Up through the woods, into the mountains. Whitestone is mountains. Yeah, I can handle both. Right. Mountain ranges are part of my favored terrain. We don't get disadvantage traveling through. There probably will be mountain giants, though, remember, that throw boulders and they will be terrible. Yes. I want to cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone. Man, you know what I would give for a flying fucking carpet right now? I'm going to tie the fucking rope around your waist before you do that. I like it. Tie a rope. I tie the other side. I use a special ranger knot that's really extra strong. Trinket. Looks like it. Tiberius, are you still on our side? Are you with me, still? Will you cast Fly on Trinket? I love you. I can climb on him and you cast Fly and you only have to use one little spell. Then do it! Yeah, you can go, and I'll just use the little rope. Okay, just protect him. No, he hasn't cast it on him yet. I am! Good thing I only had one frittata the other day! Just you and Tiberius and Trinket. Oh yeah, what do you want to do with the horses? They were tied up in a super grassy area with a shit-ton of water around. Are we in mountains yet? So I have advantage? What is this, acrobatics? SAM and 11. Vax. You want to hold me? I'm Vex. Grog grabbed me. I know. But he still said he'd grabbed me. 25. Can we stealth? I cast Pass Without a Trace on us! Up to one hour. I cast Pass Without a Trace on us now. Oh no! Terrible! I'm going to use Hide in Plain Sight. I'm going to see if I can do this. That sort of ability to camouflage the opening of the cave to where they wouldn't be able to see it. 28. Oh! I want to use my holy oil and dip a couple arrows in the holy oil because I know I can make three based on what we've done before. Oh, really? Oh, so I'll do that right before. Good to know. You ganked my sleeping bag. I ask Grog how he's doing. You want to arm wrestle? All right. But we should take watch. Wake me up when you're tired. Oh shit. Should we stealth through the mountains, just in case they have any kind of lookouts? I cast Pass Without a Trace on us again. Should we all stealth? Try at least? Add ten to it. 37. Yes. As he looks at the clock! "That's adorable." Jesus. Natural 20! A blur of blue? (shushes) Down. Hide. And I prepare-- Do we have any visual on what it could be? (whispering) Wyvern? I look at Keyleth. Keyleth. (louder) And I whisper, but for sake of microphones, do you know of a creature that's blue, and fast, and is kind of snakey but has arms and legs? I've got a really good idea. Wait. No! Grog, pick up something really heavy, and throw it as far as you can. A boulder or something. It saw us? With 37 stealth, yo. It saw us? Maybe just move really fast away from him Oh, jeez Louise! What the fuck? It's got so many arms.
