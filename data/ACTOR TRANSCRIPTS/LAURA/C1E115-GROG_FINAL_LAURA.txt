That sounded just like him. Oh, well! In addition to our Vox Machina dice that came out last week, we've got this amazing, oh, you know, "How do you want to do this?" scarf! I think I'm holding it upside down. How do you want to do this! Yeah, yours is out in the kitchen. It's soft and wonderful. We wanted this last year for Christmas or holidays, and then it didn't happen, so it's this year and it's beautiful and amazing. If it's not cold, you can hang it on your wall. It's a good banner. It's beautiful and we love it. Isn't it? You could wear it with your hoodie, or a t-shirt, or some Critical Role socks. You could wear it with your Critical Role hat and be full-on-- oh my god, I want to see someone decked full. All the shirts, and the hoodie, and the hat, and maybe the necklace. I have so many extra pairs at home. I was the one who was supposed to pass them out, but then I didn't. Yeah, the other L & T! How you feeling, baby? I can see this long-distance stare. Except Travis and I won't be there. I know! I'm missing the Honey Heist! So that's a Thursday. That means we get to ask Matt all of the secrets, and he has to tell us? Do we all get to talk as Grog tonight? Oh, that's right! Can I say one more? What? It was just announced that I joined the cast of Last of Us 2! Check out that trailer if you feel like feeling shaky and, yeah. It's pretty brutal. That's right. I'm very excited. It's all NDAs, you know. We're not allowed to share it with anybody. Okay, okay, okay! I want to point out that Keyleth's dice just rolled a one. No, I don't have my dice jail with me. But I rolled an 18 on my own personal dice. I rolled the best. No, Matt's roll was a natural 20. So those ones stay out. No chicken. There's no more chicken, Grog. So we're, like, baby versions of ourselves? You'll be the size of a pinky, maybe. That looks just like you! Can your servants bring over some liquor? Because I think we're going to need it. As always. No, I like it. Mm-hmm. Okay. I'm going to roll one of these fancy gems that I have. All right. Oh, that's really good! Oh wait, just a check? 11 plus-- 18. No, 29! That means it's 29. I'm really smart! I'm very smart. I want to grab a glass and try to catch it in a mug. So it doesn't get all over the floor, you know. So sorry about all of the vomit. Yes, she is. Oh, no! I hold the cup under her mouth as well. What do you add to it? Why wisdom? No, it's strength! Yeah, but she doesn't have any weapons on her! Oh, well I'm very perceptive, Grog. You know that. Okay. A 31. Grog, 31 is higher than 15. 31's really high. It's high. Do you even know what genealogy is? I feel like we're in a tavern right now. Is it a baby? Wait, I have a question. Are we teeny at this moment, or are we normal sized? Parcheesi? Checkers? Chess? Oh. Are we going to fight a baby now? Does it really look like a baby? I want to go over and look at the baby. Well, I fink we should let them leave! I "fink?" I'm listening to Grog too much! That's terrible! They do seem suspicious. Can I read their lips on the way out? Are they talking? Can I read their lips? What are they saying? Am I adding anything to it? 24. That's good. Okay, I think they really want to go bone. Ten gold for a room, Grog, is a lot. You do buy some things. Oh, are you going to judge us? Does one of us win more than other people? I'm going to win so good. That's a long game, Grog. I think we should go down to the cellar. You and I will go down to the cellar. Yes, we would. We take it all. After a little bit. Yeah, let's see what else is down there. Oh, this is good. 28. I'm going to try to pick the lock so I can get them. Can I do that? What do I roll to pick a lock? I'd think it's dexterity or something. 15. I don't want to smash the bottle. Is all the drink spilling out? Well, okay. That's good. Yeah! And this bottle of fanciness. We have to drink it all because we can't close it back up. Do you see anything else, Percy? While he opens it, I'm going to take a sip of this fancy wine. 13. Does it make me breathe fire? This-- what is it called? This sandkheg is really strong. You have to be very careful because it's jagged on the top. Ever. Nobody knows. Yeah, let's open this ledger. All of the food. We're carrying meat and cheese and all of that. We did for a while. And then we came back up. No, it's a cattle-- I'm not there. Yes, I am. I am still technically here. No, a cask! I'm starting to take notes. Shut up! Let Grog tell a story! Great! That's wonderful. Thank you, Bob. Oh right. I would like to make a toast to the greatest fighters, to someone who used his smart hand to carry a cask of ale. This sucks. I'm really shitty. And to Grog! And to all of this meat that we get to eat! What did you actually call it, the purple hand? What'd you call that? This is not in character. I'm asking you. Oh no! Did this stupid Bobaline poison us? Do we feel drunk? Is there any light? Can I stand up? Can I go grab a torch? Can I use my broom to fly up and grab it? Yeah, I'll grab it. Yeah, I'm going to try to sense if there's any flagons. Big ones, with wings. No, it's not a perception check, it's just my-- It's my flagon sense. Are there any flagons around? I'm going to mark off a spell. Just be quiet. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. So that we're quiet. I've already cast it. I cast it already, but roll a stealth check. Add ten to it! I don't know what that means, but I don't know why would you do that. Do you need help? It looks like a butt with a staple in it. Where's Trinket? (gasps) Grog! Trinket's here! Trinket's popping out of my necklace! Oh, I have an idea! Can I shoot one of my oracle arrows and see what's in the other room? I rolled a 45. 32. It looks the exact same? Can we see forward? Can we see? Watch for traps! You don't want to explode, I don't know what Grog has set up for us. I would like to look around the whole room. 34 for me. Can I use my broom to fly up and check out that hatch? It's bars? Is it closed off? Can I try to pull them? Can I pull on the bars to see if I can get out? Because I'm really strong, Grog. Nine. Is there a lock to be seen? I want to look and see. Ooh, Grog, what a big word! What is that, 23? 23. Did you burp? Really stinky burp. Okay. All right. I'm going to follow them down the shaft. Behind Percy. And Trinket's going to stand next to you, Grog, because he loves you so much. Just move forward, nice and easy. Oh no. Oh no! Back up! Scanlan! Back up! Yeah, you should definitely suck the poison out. No, you should just suck it out. Oh no! So, wait. So you saw darts coming out of the wall, then? Okay, so, you guys, I'll let you go ahead. So we don't step on that section. Jump over it! Whoa. 33, Grog. Yes, I would love to try and pull my brother to safety. Yeah, a strength check? Oh gosh. I'm not very strong, Grog. Ooh! 22! What about Trinket? And Grog? I'm going to say that's a 14 for Trinket. Grog, save him as he falls! Does it sound like ghosts that we have encountered? Oh no. 24. Oh, I'm going to shoot an arrow at it. From a blazing bowstring, because why not? 25? Shit. 25. Okay. Oh jeez. I'm going to decide what I should, you know, attack should-- Sure. Ten. Plus-- Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark him because I'm stupid. 15 plus fire. 15 plus eight is 23. And then for my bonus action-- Can I have Trinket jump across the thing that he just crossed and attack the ghost, too? Although I don't think I can actually have him attack after I shot an arrow. Yes, I can! Because I only attacked once, that's how it works. That's an 11 for him. That's a lot. Can he continue his attack? Probably not. Can I attack with my second arrow? Your second luck of the day. You've used two of them. Is he a dwarf ghost? Because he seems rather short. He is a dwarf ghost? I only got one arrow. You only get one dagger. Back towards the tip. Maybe you should push on it, Percy? Trinket's going to run over. Damn it, he has to cross the thingy again. I'm going to shoot another oracle arrow into the lit cavern. I do, I have one more. 26. There's a furry shape! There's an animal in there. Let's go in! I walk into the room. Oh no, we all fell over. Jesus H. That's lovely, Grog. Where was the furry creature? I'm going to look at the ground and see if there's any traps. 12. Great. Then I walk forward towards the fountain. And past it. Thank you, Scanlan. Do you want this to be a dog? Grog, can I cast Speak With Animals? I want to. And I want to talk to him. I want to say Hey, dog. What are you doing down here? Oh shit. I immediately shoot an arrow at him. But I want to Hunter's Mark him first. I'm not right on him. But I'm not right up against him. Fucking dick, Scanlan. Fine. 26. Oh, okay. That's 16 plus six is 22 plus six is 28. I want Trinket to run up and attack him too. He does, right? Oh he got a natural 20! That's really good. So I happened to be in the same tavern that he was in. I thought you would really like it. Trinket attacks him. Oh, I don't know. I know, he doesn't do this very often. He did. Ah! Okay, so 2d4 plus nine. Because it's a claw attack. Okay. Where's my other-- there it is. 23! I mean that's pretty great, right? I should have had him do that before me, I could have gotten sneak attack damage. With his claws! Oh it's boobies. I thought it was an anus. I thought it was an anus. 14. Does that hurt Trinket standing right next to him? Yeah. That's a really cool dagger. Trinket did more damage than that. 23. Scanlan! What the fuck?! Asshole. Who all is in that cone? Oh no. That's terrible for both of us. Well, not bad for me. 18. 18 for me. Trinket, though, is a four. He's not very dexterous. Oh no. Your health. How much health do you have? Oh, right here. Right. There. Jeez, Trinket's pretty close to dying. Oh shit, that's really low. Roll high, darling. Oh, okay. I'm going to-- Trinket is going to bite him back because he's a dick. Okay. That's good. 28. Okay. So he's going to do this. Ten for him. Does he get my Hunter's Mark as well? All right. Just checking. And then I'm going to shoot an arrow while he's doing that so the creature's distracted, right? Well, I mean, he's not at the table playing right now, so I have to say what he's going to do. No, he's right behind me. Yeah, he's right there. I got 31. No, 31 to hit. You're terrible. 16, 17. Where are they? I don't know. Oh, what did I say I was at? 13? Okay, good. 13, 16, 17. Yes. I killed it! It's dead. Trinket and I killed it! Good job, darling. Thank you. I want to run my hands through the fountain. Just so we can do this. In the fountain water. Oh no! 14. Oh good. Okay. So I'm going to wash my hands off. Shut up. That's-- no, he really shouldn't. Do you have any dessert? Do you have servants making any dessert? In here, in the mansion. Yeah. Well, six because we might have extra. Trinket. 20 platinum?! Oh my god. Can I see some platinum too? Can I go over there? I look for other secret doors. Okay. 25. Yeah! Is it a monster or is it platinum? Does it look like platinum? Okay. Can I look at it? 29. Aww. Grog. It's a fountain. What's that door on the far end? Trinket's going to join him. Trinket's going to bite Scanlan's shoulder. Oh, that's not my attack, it's Trinket's attack. 19. Great. Okay. This is what you get, Scanlan. 14. Yeah, he doesn't brush his teeth. (bear growling) I don't think you should. You should check out the door. He unbites you and licks your shoulder. Which really just adds more bacteria to it. What was outside of the door? We go through it. I want to walk towards the structure. All of us?! I rolled a one! Let's see what Trinket rolls. That's cocked. Trinket rolled 18. What about Grog? What a nice journey that was! I really enjoyed that. What is this? Oh, look at all those carpets. Do they fly? Is this Heaven? Really? Just Vax, then. Are those doors, or are those windows on the side? What are we standing on? They look like they have different symbols on them. Oh shit. But I know. Oh no, that's terrible. Yay. Can I walk up to the door in front of us? Yeah. Well, maybe there's one in the room with the-- Is that a money symbol? Can I go in the money room? Yeah! Yeah. Is it locked? Well, I have it now too, darling. Maybe a circle for Percy, because there's a circle on his glasses. Five gems on each door, or five gems, one gem on each door? Can I push on the glowing gem? Can I push on all the other ones? Can I pull the glowing one out? Is it Grog? Is Grog farting behind me? What is that thing? You rolled a natural 20 against me? Oh. Fuck you. Yeah. Is it trying to be like me? Is it going to take the shape of me? Trinket runs up and attacks him from the other-- Right. Trinket runs up behind him. I Hunter's Mark him, and Trinket bites him. Yeah. Natural 20! Oh. Why doesn't he do this in real life? Ten. 19. 19 damage. Na-na-na-na-nineteen. Okay. Then I am going to, for my attack, use my Rope of Entanglement on the doppelgänger. Yeah. Is Grog a doppelgänger? Strength. 16. Aww, that's bullshit. No! 16 to hit? Doesn't hit me. Okay, I'm going to kick him in the crotch! I don't want to use that one. I'll use this one. That's terrible. Wait, what do I add? Is this just a regular attack? Oh, well, that would be a two. Okay. Shit. Trinket's going to attack him. He's going to bite him. So that is 25 for Trinket. 12! Yes. I'm going to go "Doppeljenga!" Yes. Ooh, that hit me. What are these weird sounds coming from you? Fuck. All right. 52 points of damage so far. Fuck. Kill him! Just a little less. Ooh, maybe just flick him in the forehead. What? Grog's been a doppelganger this entire time? Oh good, we can eat our sherbet. Or whatever it is that we got. Who made all those little stick figure drawings? Really? Aww, that's awesome. Regerts! No regerts! Oh my goodness! [break] Oh, yeah! Yay. Ooh. That's probably important. I wonder if we touch it too many times without knowing what we're supposed to do if they, like, explode, and then we can't open it at all. Oh, but all of us reach for a door at the same time! What about Scanlan's door? Are there any jewels lit up on your door? Really? Yeah. Well, no. No, Keyleth is dead in the game. So all of us should touch a door at the same time. Yes? Wait, at the same time. I'm not touching it yet. I let go of it, because I got attacked by a doppelganger. Did I? I did. Well, I was getting attacked, so I'm assuming. I'm going to wait until other people grab their handles. And then all of us can time it. So Scanlan should go to the triangle. Do we touch it on three, or do we touch it after three? On three, or after three? All right. One. Two. Yeah, ooh. Okay. Oh, you're a cube! Because you've got a dick that's a cube! And maybe Vax is-- --a triangle, because he stabs. Percy, you have circle glasses, right, that could be something. One. Two. We're so smart! I go in. Is there a chest? I check for traps? Okay. 14. What about the chest? Is it trapped? 18. Can I open it? Oh, is it a mimic or is it a chest? What's it look like? Oh. Okay. What's that circle on the table behind me? Is it bars or is it solid? I took my potion, right? I'm going to stand at the corner of my room and aim-- My room. This corner right here and aim up at the hatch. Is anything happening? Yeah. Does it look like there's a lock on the hatch? Does it look like there's a handle on the hatch? Does it look like it opens outward or inward? To the chest? (laughs) 16? Scanlan. You're going to die from a rug! But you can't reach your earring, so nobody can hear you saying it. Yeah, we have to touch our earring in order to-- it's kind of the thing. Can we hear him? Can I hear him? I can hear you, darling. I can hear you, darling. What's up? I've got a hatch too! Scanlan, Vax, look up. Do you see a hatch? Dicks. Should I come in your room and look at your hatch, or should I continue to look at my hatch? Let me give it a try. They got so tired. There it is. The back. Being smothered by a rug? That's your last one. Can I fly up and look at the hatch up close? Also, can Trinket come in the room? He's going to stand in the other corner. What can I see up close? Anything? Can I push on it? Can I get my fingers in and pull on it? Can I stick a dagger in at the edges and try to pry it open? Well, he rolled two criticals, and something happened. What if I roll a critical? Ooh, so close. It was a 19. Kill it! That's a lot of lightning damage. So warm. 4d4. Mine didn't have any creatures in it. I like that you can sneak attack the rug. It doesn't know you're there! Oh no. Am I still up at the latch? Am I still right at the latch? Well, I said I was. I never stopped being there. Can I push on mine? My latch is open. My hatch! Scanlan, Vax? Should we go in? I do. I bamf Trinket into my necklace, first. Is it another room, or is it a tunnel? Grog, you are so artistic! We can see each other? Is that Sharpie at the bottom of that pepper mill? Travis Willingham! Can we walk over to it? I want to walk over to it and kick it. Oh no, eight points. Is it gone now, or is it still there? Oh, a pony, yay! 22. No, don't attack me, pony! No, I'm not going to, it's so cute! What do I have to roll to avoid it? Okay. 17. It hits. But I have uncanny dodge and evade, which one do I use? A strength saving throw? If I use evasion does it still have to do that? That was so fucking close. 25. That's me! Are my hands restrained or is it just my feet? I can't move my feet? Okay. I'm going to cast Grasping Vine. And I'm going to try to hook a vine around the unicorn and pull him back towards the corner right here. He dies. He's got legendary actions? What a fucking dick! Fine, well, Grasping Vine is a bonus action. I don't think he can resist it, but whatever. It's not like it's a spell effect, he has to make a dexterity save. Nope, not at all. Can I shoot him? No, I don't want to shoot him! Can I talk to him? I want to say Unicorn, why are you attacking me? I don't want to fight you. I'm speaking in Unicorn. I'm speaking in Unicorn. Grog, how do you know it's not a language? All right, then I'm going to speak in normal, and I'm speaking Elvish! I feel like unicorns might be able to understand. I said Elvish. So I say Why are you fighting me? Why? I don't want to fight you. I don't want to hurt you. I love you. That's my whole turn. I don't think so. It sounded kind of like a bird. What? That's so low. How are you doing, Scanlan? You really caught on. No, I have no idea-- Doesn't hit. That hits. How do you know? It is really pretty though, Scanlan. That was Scanlan. Yeah! Am I still entangled? Saving throw? That would be 19. I'm going to use my bonus action to use the Grasping Vine again and try to wrap right around his leg and yank him back. That is a dex save. Oh, then he's restrained. Or he's pulled back at least. Yeah! So it falls over, it's all right. And then I'm going to cast Speak with Animals, although I don't need to because he already-- And I'm going to say You're a very good creature. I know you're lawful. What are you doing fighting me? I'm good too! Anything? No response? Okay, just know that I don't want to attack you, I'd rather just ride around on you, because you seem really beautiful. And then for my movement, I'm going to hop on my broom and fly up in the air. Not quite to the top of the tower. How high does the tower go? I'm going to just go up 40 feet. Ooh, you have them! Wait, maybe flip it over. That's it! Yeah (counting). I'm about ten feet higher than I should be. He's also stuck in that position because of the Grasping Vine. Where? Where does he go? Oh no. Ugh, it fucking hits me. Do need to make a dexterity save to see if I stay on my broom? Okay. I'm going to take the greater healing potion. Which is 4d4. Whoa, that's a really good 14 points plus four, right? So 18 points healed. And then I'm going to fly over the unicorn, and drop down, landing on its back! And I'm going to use my Rope of Entanglement to make like a harness thing and hold on to the fucking unicorn like a fucking rodeo. Because he's lawful good. Okay. That would be a one. (laughs) I deserve that. Right back down to where I was before I healed. But thank god I healed! Am I on my back or on my stomach? No! Can I try to hang on? I want to try to hang on to his hair! Well, I don't need to roll the other one, because it's a one. Oh no, am I getting eaten by the unicorn? Thank you! It worked! I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself at 3rd-level. Can I bamf Trinket out and see if he recognizes the scent? Can he smell for perception on the body to see if he recognizes who it is? Yeah, he has smell perception. He's got advantage on smell perception. Does that count? No, but it's a natural 20! Damn it. What does that mean? Okay. (gasps) Great. So 26. What's going on? SAM I don't know! I think he's dead. Yeah, but I'm going to kill Scanlan anyway. I bamf him back out and heal him. I cast Cure Wounds at 3rd-level. What are you doing down on the ground? Yeah, I leave him out, and I cast Speak with Animals on him. And I have another one, you dick! It only lasts ten minutes. And I go Trinket, what happened? Scanlan! Did you kill my bear? Did you kill him? Why would you do that? I try to put Scanlan in the necklace. I think he has to be willing. So I don't try to put him in the necklace? But don't I have to roll? Well, I can. But you have to roll a DC wisdom save. Ten. Balls. Well, do I believe him? It's just so weird that he got sick right after you gave him food. Is the electric field still up? I fly up, put Trinket back in my necklace and fly up. I'm going to join in. 15! Yeah, we were just a little behind you. That's how I pictured your mom singing it. We're just fighting Grog. 16. Yeah. Oh man! I really should have healed up more! Shit! How crazy will it be to go back to just rolling one die? No! Hey, Percy, leave some Grog for the rest of us! Okay. I'm going to bamf Trinket out and run up to Grog, but he's not going to attack him. Yeah, he's going to run up next to him. I'm going to Hunter's Mark Grog. Then I'm going to shoot him twice. Well, I'm going to shoot him first, hold on, let's see if it hits. 22. That's a bramble shot. That's going to be 4d8 of piercing damage plus regular damage! Nine, 17, 19. Plus-- what was that? 19? 19 plus five is 24 plus eight is 32. Plus lightning. 36. Hunter's Mark. 37. Plus sneak attack. 43. 46 damage on the first arrow, and Grog has to make-- like this is going to be really hard for him-- a strength saving throw. He's restrained. Well, Grog is restrained. What does a werewolf take? Silver? Oh. Fucking hell! Okay. I'm going to shoot him again while he's restrained. I already used it. That definitely hits. 30-something. Ten, 12, 15. 15 for the second arrow, and I fly up in the air. Kick up on the broom and fly up in the air. That high. Sure, why not? Maybe try to get him unconscious or something. Yeah, I'm going to try. Can I use my last Cure Wounds at 3rd-level and heal him? Yeah, I'll heal him for now, and then Pike will really heal him. Yeah, obviously. Oh, that game was so fun! Questionable? Grog, that was great. I have 200. Red. That was really good. How do you plan the next move that you're going to do when every turn is your turn, as well? "Stroogle?" It is a "stroogle." And also, we have scarves! Dual-sided scarves! Love you, baby.
