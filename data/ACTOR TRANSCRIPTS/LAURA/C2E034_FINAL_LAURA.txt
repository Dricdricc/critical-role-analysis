Do the voice, Sam! You're so good at it! That was really good. Are you Max? Did you just burp? That was really good, Marisha. Are you really Marisha? I know. I don't believe it. Are you going to be naked for it? Is that a shell? Are you a turtle? Yeah, I'm a shithead. I was asking how you got your eye patch. Did you-- did somebody shoot it out of your eye? You don't remember? Oh yeah, I will buy you a drink if you tell me how your eyeball went missing! What-- oh do you not want milk? Do you want something else? Okay. Okay. Well I'm from up the street kind of. I'm the daughter of the Ruby of the Sea. Do you work for any government officials? I'm the daughter of the Ruby of the Sea. And you know these are my friends and we've gotten into a lot of hijinks and um... what all did you want to know? Yes. Do you have money to take care of it? It's also possible that we met my dad earlier and we didn't know it. Okay. I appreciate you too. How did you get those pipes on your back? (laughter) Is your name Marius? Okay. Nancy. You started sliding-- (laughter) It's the bagpipes, isn't it? You're proficient. Have you seen him lately? Do you know where he went? It's a present. It was a present for him. Ooh! There's the woman. I have a dog that's peeing on shit. Insight? Oh. You did. That's a natural one! My mom. Yep. Why does it sound familiar? How do we know that? Caleb, do you have a memory of this? Why is it so familiar?! (whispering) Widow's Embrace, Widow's Embrace, Widow's Embrace. Really? Oh, fuck! What are you doing here? Did you know we were here? Did you get our message? Did you get my messages? I sent you lots of messages, Yasha. Well, they said that we were-- They mostly said that I missed you and that we were going to Nicodranas and we were heading over to find out more stuff about-- I don't remember what we're even doing here in Nicodranas anymore. We're here for Fjord and we're finding out stuff about him and also we saw my mom. Did you see it now? Because we're here in the city. It's right over there. Go somewhere where? What's it look like? (gasps) My dad is from islands! At least he was. Did you know my dad might be The Gentleman? (whispering) That's why I'm blue! I know! Potentially. I mean, it could've happened. She's right here. You can meet her if you want to. I told her all about you. Is it presents for us? Have you been gathering presents for when you saw us again? He's this really creepy guy who was trying to get with her, and she's like, "I don't know," and then he's like, "You're only going to be mine!" She's like, "I don't like that," and now he's threatening everybody else that wants to see her. Yeah! It's fate! It's the Traveler. Maybe. Or you. Keep a dream journal. I have a weasel! Here. His name is Sprinkle. He's not trained yet. Don't lose him. Mmm. There's a dog too. I know it's been a long time, but her name is Yasha. Can he blink that far? I mean, when I blink, I blink only ten feet. Believe me, I wanted to go farther, and I just kept blinking. Beau, we need to get going. We need to find Algar. I can't believe you didn't get my messages! To your brain! Well I guess I could have sent them while you were sleeping, I guess. I need to be more specific with my messages. You know, and I never got to say, "You "can reply to this." That's an important part of it. (sad trombone noise) How do we find Al Gore-- Algar? Shit! Or the Sluice. I use Thaumaturgy to bang the windows! Over at the fancy-- I forget the place that I'm from. The fancy place. The Lavish Chateau! Let's get out of here and find the guy. Also we have to remember tonight. Head to the docks. Marius. Yeah. That's going to be a really important one. We can't just go to the Sluice Weave, it's underwater. And they said we could get in trouble if we go there uninvited. This is true. I thought the gates were underwater? Let's go and see if we can see something. Yeah. Yasha can swim, though. I'll hold your hand underwater, Nott. Like a dolphin. Let's go to the docks! Is it big enough for all of us? That's true, Yasha could put the ring on. Yeah, and you'd be safe in the boat. Surrounded by water in the ocean. Maybe I should too, because, you know, I'm watery now. Yeah. I am blue and that's the same color as the sea. Hey, Yasha. This is the sea. It's pretty, huh? Oh, so you were lying. What? I like that. I get in the water. Go ask your sailor friend, Fjord! Yeah, get back out and go ask him where the Sluice is. Woo! Yeah! It's still wet! Was he telling the truth? How do you know? It's my fault, I'm sorry! I yell from the water. Oh, that's not bad! I love imagining Beau in the outfit that she's in. Freaking wraps on her arms. Wait. Wouldn't it be funny if that was Marius? She lives inside of you. I guess so. Do we see her? Like Clarota. Like (brain-sucking sound). Don't worry, Nott. If you fall over the side, Fjord and I will catch you. Are you saying what you see? Caleb, are the bars rusted? Did they seem rusted at all? Is there any air between the water and the grate? Getting bored sitting in the water out here. Hey Yasha, let's go try to break through that grate. Get him back here and let's try to get through that grate! He looked through Frumpkin's eyes and there was nothing. I flick him in the back of the head three times. Well Frumpkin wasn't getting sucked in, was he? No! I want to go try to break through the grate. Hold on to Spr-- Oh! I can't do it. I'm afraid you are going to eat my weasel. You promise me you won't eat him? Don't eat the puppy either. Promise. Promise? No, Nott! (laughter) Okay. Let's go! Oh yeah, let's get a hand on it and brace our feet against the tunnel and on the count of-- It was a practice count! What'd he say? Let's roll independently. (pointedly humming) She's really strong. Did it seem like it was hard to hold our breath while we were doing all of that? Yeah, let's try the other one! Really? Ooh, nice! Okay, we try to go to the second one and break through. Okay, so this time, I'll be more specific. I'll go hm, hm, hm, and then we pull it! Yeah, one, two, three, pull! Yeah. One, two, three, pull! Yeah. Natural 20! (cheering) 23. Hot. I say about myself. Up and up? Up and breathe! So are you! Oh, well that'll totally-- Oh no, the animals! Oh god! No, it's going to die! No! I don't want it to die! And the dog is just on the boat! Ay! You made it! Ah! Sprinkle! Where's Nugget? I really should have left the puppy with my mom. And we tied the boat, yeah? Oh god! Yay! Yay Nugget! We have really good pets. I'll put him in my hood and stuff and warm up. What if the water comes in while we're in here? We should probably hurry up then, huh? We could try. Can we get our fingers in? Let's try it. Can we try to bust it out? Nine. Can we see through it at all? What's in there? Does it seem like water is ever up along the walls, or does it seem like the water is always at the level it's at? 18. Okay, I think we're safe. Oh no. No, it doesn't count because I'm up two now. 18. I did? I got 19! Thank you. Okay. I'm going to cast... Spiritual Weapon! Woo! It's pitch dark? So, all of us can see? Right above, next to Beau. Yeah. And I'm going to hit it! Or I'm going to try. Okay, I'll shift to my left. (singing) To my left, to my-- yeah. 14? 11 points of damage! And then I'm going to Toll the Dead on him! A wisdom save. (yelling) 2d12! 11 points of damage! It vibrates through the water. Suck a bag of dicks, water creature! (laughter) Oh no! Oh no. 17. Except for Nott. Bring my Spiritual Weapon down! That's 16. That sucks. This plus four is five! And then I'm going to use Guiding Bolt at the other one. And I'm assuming-- tell me if I'm wrong-- because it's a flash of light that streaks towards the creature, that would give enough light for Caduceus to send something out? All right. Okay, so how do I do Guiding Bolt? 11 plus seven. 18. That is 4d6! 15. Yes. Advantage on attacks against that one. Advantage! What the heck is that? Tell us what it means. Science! There's a treasure chest?! It's engaged to me. It's not terrible. Fjord, I am your dream! He's really good at it. You never know. What? Where does that next tunnel go? Splash, splash, splash. I'm going to kick through the barrel while he's doing that. Did I find a gold? Let's keep booking. And Nugget's going to run up and try to bite and play with Frumpkin. Oh shit, it's a foot and a half. Nugget, come back here. Blink to me, darling, blink to me! Ooh! That is a 23! Blink to me, Nugget! Yeah. (gasps) I'll take a really good bath when we get back. Oh no! No! Oh no. Like monsters, more of those water things? Maybe we could get up to those little terraces or something and avoid it. Can anybody walk on walls? What if we don't touch the water? What if all of us hang on the side of the walls and move around the room? I cast Pass Without a Trace. Do I have that? I do. Yeah, I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. We're going to stealth, right? Because I just cast it on all of us. Yeah, and I give Caduceus the Blessing of the Trickster. You get advantage. Add ten. 19. I want to listen, but I shouldn't listen. How far away is Algar from us? I bet it's his necklace. Zsundie has a necklace on and he's like-- Not Zsundie, I want to fight Algar. Oh, Melora. Did you think we were going to get to this? You sounded like Bob Ross as he was saying that. It's all happening nicely. No, we haven't come in yet. We were all hiding in this little thing. I'm putting you in the back, Nott. So you can hop up. Oh, that's true. That was our lineup. So how far is that? (humming along) They have high constitution, that's what you said? So they probably have pretty high. He's glowing. Nine. The fancy one. The tall one. It came off again. Yeah, go for Algar! Oh, things are happening! But it looks pretty. Yeah, that's it! Yay, Matt! Good job, Matthew. Moist. MARISHA and Fuck butt? Tug your shirt. Over Beau? But it keeps them from going back. Yeah! Ugh. He heals. Yeah, he took damage from you. You! You were using my dice? Okay, I'm going to walk forward as far as I can, like here? Can I get here? Okay, I'm going to Invoke Duplicity 30 feet in front of me. Well, I'm sure right around there. Yeah. Then my duplicate is going to cast Spiritual Weapon at what's his fuck? At Algar. Yeah, but I can see where he went. It's 120-- Yeah! Still the lollipop, but razor blade edges. I'm going to try to hit his arm and chop off his arm. Natural 20! (cheering) Did that work? Did I chop off his arm because that's what I was trying to do! I'm hoping it hits him! Ten damage. My duplicate goes, "Ha ha," too. Yeah, sure. (singing) On D&D! Has a necklace on, but Algar has a bracelet on that's controlling it. It's a collar. Did I chop off his hand? Can you tell? Damn it! Yes. Put that one away for a while. You don't know, you don't know. You don't know. Oh, fuck. Okay. Oh, but can I make her, like, fall? Probably not, because it's not my turn. He's bringing out the hentai. But it was in darkness, right? So none of us actually saw it. That was such a gentle roll. We don't want him to die. Okay, okay. Yeah. Yeah, so don't worry. So can he drown and then he stabilizes and then he drowns and stabilizes? That's must be stressful. Okay. I'm going to step forward. I'm going to stay away from the water thing. I'm going to use my duplicate to go forward and touch Caduceus. And she's going to cast Cure Wounds at third level. So that's 3d8. So that is (counting) 19 points of health. And then with me, I'm going to Sacred Flame. For myself. Just kidding! (giggling) I'm just going to flail around with the Spiritual Weapon and hope I hit something. It's okay, it's a 15. But the other one was a natural 20. Mm-hmm. I'm going to move my own person towards Caleb. Yeah. I'm going to move me towards Caleb. Oh, he does?! Oh, I didn't realize it was within range. He doesn't hit me. I have a shield. (clanging) Okay. Yeah. (gasps) Could I have used my Hellish Rebuke? If he didn't actually hit me? Yeah! I want to use my Hellish Rebuke. Actions. Yeah. Screams, ahh! Sounds like what? You defend your mom. Come on, I heal people. Ooh! Zsundie, Zsundie, Zsundie. Is it attacking me? That was an aggressive roll. Seven. Okay. Okay, does he do damage to me at all? Hellish Rebuke. That is, yes. Dexterity. No it's not. Yeah, it's a 12. Half damage! Okay so that's still 3d10 of cold damage (counting) 11. And what was it? 13 damage? Okay, we're still alive. Oh no. Okay. Is he dead? Is he dead yet? Yay! Okay. No, I don't want to, though! I'm going to-- you're still unconscious, though-- Okay. I'm going to cast (singsong) Cure Wounds at third level. On Caduceus. That's right. 18 plus four is 22 points of health. (singsong) Then for my bonus action I'm going to swing around with the-- oh, I can see now! But I still can't see anything that's around there. That's okay! (slurred) Just going to do it again. 19! 12 points of damage! I'm going to move to where I'm not in a line with these people. I'm going to hop over as far as I can that way. Then hide. Right there. You can stand up. Bracelet! Pull his bracelet off! (screams) Nice! Don't cut his hand, just take the bracelet! Maybe he's coming to thank you! Maybe! That means that the city's going to be without electricity. If you put-- oh, fuck. Muscle girls!
