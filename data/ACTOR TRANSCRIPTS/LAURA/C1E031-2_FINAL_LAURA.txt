Okay. I know! I've got to put this one away for a while. I rolled a nine. 230? I'm going to take the whole jewelry box and sort through it later. Does he sleep in a coffin? That's better, thank you. (cries out in pain) No need to yell! Oh, lovely. Is there treasure? Did you find treasure? Smash it! They're making something big. Should we light this on fire, too? Yeah, sneaky, stealthing. Pass Without a Trace I cast on all of us. Yeah, I'm fine with Pass Without a Trace. That's a 1st-level. 2nd-level, but I'm fine. Critmas! Oh, right. Plus ten for everybody. 11, technically. 29. I know, we really should. Yeah, perceive it? 26. Should we knock on the door? They're right on the inside. Right on the other side of the door. Oh. Crazy grandma! No. I don't know. (louder) Crazy grandma was staying with you. Crazy peasants. Can I help? LAURA AND 18. So, hey guess what? It's started. No. No, no. "Oh. Well." How about Seeming? This whole time, have we looked like crazy peasants during the battle? MATT and We dropped it? Okay, just making sure Trinket wasn't a donkey that killed the-- "I'm crazy grandma." I do a crazy eye thing just to show her. So it went well? We just need to rest. Until we're healed, and then we'll go. I feel like we should get word out to somebody, though, because-- I feel like everybody's going to die before we even get to the castle! But we don't have any spells. I can't make do. How do we tell the people to like hold off? Can we send off a message? What if we all take off in separate directions and we tell all the peasants we find that are fighting the time that we're going to attack? Well yeah, we'll have to be sneaky about it, but we'll spread the rumors around. I look at Jordana. Joanna? Jordana. And I say, can you get word out to people? I don't blame you, dear. No, they don't like running water, in fact they hate running water! I didn't think about that. What, so we go out and fight zombie giants? Well. We could go fight zombie giants and then tell everybody to wait. What if we run out and tell people to stop fucking fighting and wait until tomorrow? Fuck! Fine. All right. We fight until we absolutely can't fight anymore. At this point, though, it's chaos. They said there was an informant. They said that there was an informant when we were there. That guard. He said our contacts were right. Our informant was correct. Somebody is informing on us. It could be you. Can I say it? Because I just said, "It could be you." Can I do the same thing? All right. That's terrible. Okay. So. Well, short rest and then we head out? We do some attacks and-- No, but everybody else is doing it. Those peasants are doing it. We keep our distance. We need a long rest to get spells. They're zombies. We short rest and get back out. Oh, Trinket. Can you heal Trinket? Heal him so much. Does Trinket get... oh, he does get hit dice. It says he does. It's written down. Yeah. Are you healing Trinket? He's at 36. He needs 24 more. Yeah. Do you not need it? I don't have anything on my head. Okay. Me? I'll do it. It was good. Oh, yeah. Do that. No, it's fine. He's got extra hit points; don't worry about it. Yay! No. Actually, before we go, I ask, do you have any holy symbols at all in here? Nothing? Do you have anything magic that could help me? Oh, right. I forgot we took it. Shit. All right, thank you. Awesome. What? No. What? What are you talking about? No. Maybe he was already a vampire and he hung him from the tree just to show-- Let's head that direction. They come back. Probably pretty fair. Sure. We'll make our way through the town and look for giants as we make our way to the tree. Are they all dead, or are they injured? If my passive perception's higher than my roll-- Shit. Really? Does it look like the ropes have been cut? Oh. They were cut. They cut them down. Can we spin around and look and see if there's anything around that looks like-- or look at tracking and see if it looks like somebody cut them down or if they fell on their own? What is it? Say it! It's on the ground. You can probably see above it. Fog is low. I'm going to climb up after her. Stop looking up her skirt, brother. Good job. I grab the back of her shirt and yank her towards me. Are we running? I'm definitely doing that, yes. I'm going to shoot at the giant as we're running. Hunter's Mark him. Can I shoot him? And I'm going to shoot him through my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel as we're going away, too. 22. Twice. And then three on the last one. Well, it's technically 14 on the last one. Oh, sweet! 54 points of damage. Well, I've got another attack. That was just one attack that I did. Pass Without a Trace! Just run, Keyleth! Oh, are they going to take out everybody? Oh my gosh. There's like, there's a lot.
