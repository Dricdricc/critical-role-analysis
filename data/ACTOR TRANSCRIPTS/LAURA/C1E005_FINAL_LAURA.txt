There's a card on it. On the other side. Yeah. Oh, you're still up top. Oh. Of course I would, thank you. We don't want your blood. We're looking for a halfling. Have you seen one? A female halfling. She came down here. That's the way! King what? Yes. Can I start speaking to him in Underdark? And I ask him-- Yep, it's an awesome language. Tell me about the hidden passages. I know there are some. I am good tonight, you guys It sounds kind of like-- (speaking Undercommon) Oh right, that. Right, I have my papers. Oh noes, hold on, hold on. 18. Can we check to make sure he's not untruthful? (groans) Okay. 16? Oh, okay. You're lying. Tell us true, where is it? I think that's reasonable. We'll-- I think we can-- We'll leave you alive. Yeah-- -- all his clothes, everything. What do we do? I think we should stop him. Should we stop him? Wait. I think we should just ask him. (whispers) And you have to get naked. What kind of creature is K'varn? But you've heard rumors, though? Is he telling the truth? Maybe we should let him go. Yeah, let's take his-- We take Grog's handcuffs out of his bag. Well, tell us! You haven't told us yet, have you? But your life is yours. Wait, wait. He's telling us, shut up. You're free to go. Not toward your stronghold, but towards the surface. My perception's really high, can I try to find him? Wait, no! Mother bitch. He's not naked! Oh, Clarota. Oh no. Yeah, well. Yeah, we definitely do that. Clarota-- Was that actually, like, a meal for you? Well. Better him than us, I say. Loot the body! Ooh! I write that down. Is it just him wearing the black plate armor-- -- or any of the other bodies wearing it, too? We should take that and put it in the bag of holding, so we can sneak in if we want to. How many sets were there? 11 sets of armor! Nice! I did? A grappler arrow? Seriously? That's so cool, thank you! Oh my gosh. What is it? What was it? All right. Yes, two lava flows-- -- the smaller of the two. Yes. Can I ask a question? Are there a lot of other soldiers still in the camp, or did we-- Ooh. Oh shit! We should've kept him alive, you guys! Okay, okay, okay. Yes, Grog? Ooh! Okay, we should all-- Can we all-- Okay, we should all put on black armor. Does that matter? We need to free those dwarves. Stealth, stealth. And get out. Go stealth and get out. I shoot my grapple thing and go up out of the ceiling. But I take the dust of tracelessness out of the bag of holding and I sprinkle it around the room. Can we grapple up out from the ceiling? Oh, I thought it was like a grappling-- Oh, that's cool, okay. I have a grappling hook. Yeah, we should grapple out. We have a regular grappling hook, we'll just get up out of the-- What are we doing? Up and out. Can we stealth, while we do it? Where's Trinket? Oh, he's just on the other side by himself, all lonely? That's so terrible. Nice. Ooh, natural 20! 31 for me. Oh, they saw us. How did they see us? I thought we were stealthed. We haven't healed him yet. Two crits against you? He is here, technically. Nice! Oh. No, but Trinket! We shouldn't go down. We got to free those dwarves, y'all. Keyleth isn't a-- What happened? Okay, okay! No, no, she was on Grog, she was-- Yeah, we dive under them. Chunk. Can we try to catch-- can we try to-- what do I have? Over the war camp. Can I try to-- Can I use the rope of endless twine and try to lasso one of them? 'Cause I'm really a good shot. Oh god. Okay, then you should-- Oh okay, except you're dangling off of it now by a rope. That's too many people on the carpet. Oh no! We're gonna die! Oh shit. Everybody jump up in the air! We're right over the camp, aren't we? Yeah, we're all like bracing. I have Scanlan! He's falling. No, Grog! You leap off of the carpet? Oh no. This is tense. Oh God. Oh no, Grog! I'm shielding Scanlan. Can we jump onto the top of the building? Intelligence! Oh, god. Which one to roll, which one to roll. Depending on how we roll? Welp, Scanlan. I'm sorry to let you know-- But I have a plus nine acrobatics! Plus nine acrobatics! Doesn't matter on a natural crit fail. I'm sorry, Scanlan! You're unconscious again? Oh no, we're all dead! Everybody? As a group, like we all failed as a group? And I take 35? No, no! He was fully healed. (Softly) Fuck. No, you, here, you take care of him, I'm right next to Scanlan, Okay! I'm gonna-- Oh! (gasps) ASHLEY and And I'm pouring some down Scanlan's throat. Yeah? 2d4? That's pathetic. Okay, fine. As we're getting up, can I see-- Is the camp nearby, where the prisoners are? Is that anywhere near us? Mass Cure Wounds? Can we stealth while we're doing this, or are we too, like, injured? Bolting it, right. Okay. 24 mass? Oh, she just healed everybody for 24 points. I feel pretty good now. What what! Oh my god, it's major. Are we running? I don't know what you guys are doing. What's happening right now? No! Oh, man. Can we run out, try to grab him? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, all right. I love you, Trinket! Yeah! Yeah, they could get through it. Clarota's with us. Don't get too close, he might just suck in your brain. No! Can we try to pull it out? Do you wanna do that, Grog? Oh. So what are you-- Okay. All right. Do it! (laughs) Oh no. Able to be healed. I hand him a little healing potion, and say, sorry. We should move! Yeah, all right. Is he good enough to walk or is he-- We still have the flying carpet? If you need it. We should've gone down! What were we thinking? Well, he said go down. We didn't go down. 13 for me. I like how my passive perception is way higher than any rolls that I ever do. Oh, good! Should we take the left one? Yeah, so maybe we should stay left. Do you remember anything? What about the general's memory? Anything there? Can we go up and-- No, can we go next to the one on the far left and see if I sense any like wind coming down, is there-- Oh, well, good. We should do that. Keep going down. Down, down, down. Keep going down? I think we keep going down. Just stick with it. Oh. Well, then let's go with the decline. Yes? Let's do it! Yes. With stealth! With Dust of Tracelessness behind us. Flower girl! Yeah. Oh, god. Grog! Grog! Stop! I'm gonna take off after him. We take off after him, 'cause he needs help. Yes. Can you do another wall? No? Well, that might be dangerous. Can we go, oh! Can we go in? We should probably rest, heal up, get our spells back. Can you cast the illusion terrain and make it look like there's no hole in the cavern here? But we have to be able to get back out. Can we go in and look at the camp and see, like, stealthily-- -- check out what the camp is? 20. (gasps) Oh! This was her camp! Kima was here! Oh. Mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, that's nice. Torch, torch, torch, torch. Can I use Tracking and see what happened, like Prince Humperdink, please? Can do? Okay, okay. Well, can I see who was attacked first? Does it look like Kima was attacked, or she-- The drag marks, do they lead outside of the alcove and down? Okay. Do we need to rest? I mean-- -- I feel like we need to get our spells back, otherwise we're just gonna get killed. Yeah. I guess that's the best thing to do. Maybe seal the tunnel behind us, yeah, so that-- -- if they do come, they have to like, try to get through. Trying to get through, yeah. All right. Yeah. I know. You can keep burning a torch. Stick it in the ground. Oh, sweet! Yeah, let's fully rest. Tinker's? You do? This is the best day ever! Gently! I gingerly put it in my quiver. Oh god, all right. Should I keep it away from the rest of my stuff? Is there a possibility it could explode just-- Maybe I won't keep it straight behind my head. Let's just kind of keep it down at my waist-- With the dagger, maybe. Is that cool? All right. Did we all rest? Are we all rested? (gasps) Oh no. How many is many? A lot. We should wake up. Well like the-- no, no, no. From like-- Up the path, right? They're gonna know, 'cause we blocked off the friggin' path! I'm asleep. Sorry. (whispers) What? You're just really-- What? What's going-- I stealth. God damn. I should stop rolling this fucking dice. Oh! Yeah, that was a one. This, by the way-- -- was given to me by Wil Wheaton. Thank you, Wil. No, she was-- (whispers) But you needed your spells. Thank you, thank you. Ah-- what? What? Oh no. Did eyebrows go up? Can we see through the dark-- but we can see in the dark? There's no light in this area at all? Oh no. Hit dice. We forgot about that because it wasn't there before. Oh, no, he put it up next to our alcove. So, they just kind of passed by our alcove. Yes. We did. Well, no, well, it's pillars, though, they could have-- -- they could have seen us. I think we should all freshen up, since it's a new day! Yeah, that. That. Intermission! Yep. Can we squish through the little cracks? We have to cut it down? So we've gotta break our way out of here, Grog. Oh, it's right here. Stealth! Ahead of us. Dooragar? Yes. They might be ahead of us. And lend our energy to you. Bats. MARISHA and All right. Nice. You knew it was coming, as well. You guys, you guys. These caverns are getting to us. (all laugh) All right, all right, all right, let's call this. We're going crazy down here. Yeah. Visions? You had a vision? What? Oh, soul matter? This horn? The horn of-- Okay, no narwhals. The horn of K'varn, yes? Okay. Can you lead in the direction to go? I think that probably-- The place we're going to. A fungal fortress? Did the blue gemstones look valuable? Your colony? In the fungal city. (whispers) Jade. Ah. So I bet the fortress-- So I bet, first fortress you saw, I bet the one of obsidian was where-- -- where Lady Kima is being held. I bet that's the one, because he mentioned molten lava or something. So she's being held there and then further in is K'varn. Emberhold, yes. Is that an obsidian fortress? Well, let's keep going that way. So, just keep going, then? No. Yeah, let's keep going. Avoid that! Don't touch that. Oh. Can we stealth, can we stealth? And my favored terrain is the Underdark. I don't know what that means, though. (all laugh) Does it give me an advantage? Oh good, thank you. Yes, okay. Let's go. Yes, finally. The same for me, actually. Twinsies. Sorry. Can we see it? Can I understand what they're saying? And I look on the ground and see if I can find multiple sets of footsteps as well. Oh, he's trying to see if they're seeing us. We back away. We string a rope across the tunnel. Oh! What does that do? That is stupid. This is gonna go really poorly. This is dumb. And we call, I go, Grog! I know, right? Oh god, here we go. Oh! Lava pools. Oh god! Are they trolls, are they ogres? Oh, god, one's on the ground. It's huge, these are really big. This is so dumb, why did we do this? Do we get the surprise at all? Okay, cool. Oh, man, really? 15. Yeah. Oh! Oh no, Grog, what did you roll? Oh, they're huge. Yes, Grog. Awesome. Oh, nice. Wow. 62. What? I Hunter's Mark him, and I'm gonna shoot him with the explosive arrow. So I'm gonna see if it hits. I'm gonna use the blazing bowstring. That's a 22. Okay. Also, blazing bowstring that gives me a plus d10. So, okay, 14 plus d10, wait, that's a ten? Yeah! Plus 19 and then Hunter's Mark! Plus six! 25, plus whatever the explosive damage is. Right! Oh shit! Oh, I hope I didn't blow up the cart. (gasps) Oh no. Welp? Oh, and can I move away? Yeah, I move back. Yeah. Sounds good. Oh right! Well, there. Does anybody speak Ogre? Nobody speaks Ogre, though. We can't talk to him. He's so dead! (gasps) Over the dead body of his brethren. Oh no, what did we do? Oh, god. We let something out. Does it-- Oh no-- Is it on fire so we can see-- -- is it on fire so we can see what it is? The cart wasn't on fire? This is really, really bad! I'm sorry I exploded it. (whispers) Don't attack it. I'm scared of it. What does a black ooze do? Oh no, oh god, Scanlan. Do something amazing, Scanlan! You received an inspiration. I want some food. I'm so hungry. Me? Okay, on the thingie? Okay. Well I'm gonna Lightning Bolt the black ooze! Okay. Which-- Yes, I do. Okay. Oh, and, oh, the other-- never mind, that other guy's still Hunter's Marked. Okay. Okay, that's good. That's a 19 plus-- that's a regular attack bonus, right? Was it? That's just for you, yo. Okay. So. Okay, 4d8 of lightning damage. Oh, okay. Just kidding, I'm just so excited! 11. Okay. And the 4d8 of lightning damage. No. Splits? What is this thing? Great. Cool. Awesome. Oh, yeah! I back the eff up. Actually, should-- yeah, yeah. I'm gonna back up. To there sounds good. That's Vax'ildan. I'm sorry I let the ooze loose. That's good. Over the lava pit. Don't fall in the lava pit. Okay, that's good. Bless you. 15 hits. Well, what else are we gonna do with it? What about the areas I exploded? Okay, okay. Too soon? Woo! Okay, that's good. Good! Woo! Fire damage! Kill it with fire! Yep. (laughs) Okay. Yeah, do it! And then we can see what it does to creatures within its zone! Maybe up next to the ogre dead. Yeah. Yeah, do it. Go for it, Pike. Ten. 18. Yeah, four. She gets four. 25. 25. Ooh. Yeah. Stay away from the insect cloud. Wait, but my natural ability-- Difficult terrain does not slow my group's travel when this is my favored terrain. Don't get touched by it. Don't let it touch you. If it's a zero, it's a ten. Oh, that's a three. He rolled the-- I know. Yeah! (gasps) No! Acid. You're low? On health? Have you not healed at all? Jeez Louise. No. Oh. What? (gasps) Grog's unconscious. You're not? Oh my god. Clarota, save us! Don't do a Lightning Bolt! What? Why would Clarota use a Lightning Bolt when he saw that the lightning did not work for me? Ugh. Clarota is trying to screw with us. Fudge! God! Darn it. What is that? What is happening? Is it another one of those-- Are you freaking kidding me? He's trying to kill us. What is this? We're gonna die. Pike isn't here! Hits. Misses. Okay. She's good. Good job. Damn, Tiberius is getting really freaking cool. Badass. Ooh. Nice! Okay. Do I have line-of-sight on the other ooze that's attacking Grog? The big one? Okay, then I guess I should just-- What about the little ooze? One of the little oozes? I guess I should attack the one that's in the lava. Okay. Well. Oh! Can I-- Is he within ten or five feet of the other, the little ooze? Okay, then I'll just attack him with my-- I'll just attack him. This is lame, that's a lame-- Oh right, two attacks. 13? Pathetic. 20-something. All right, cool. Can I have used my flaming bowstring on the second one? Sweet. Oh! And I Hunter's Marked him, because I can do that. 13. 13. 19 and 22 damage. Okay. I'm gonna back up and get against the wall. Oh wait, that's me! Oh, I was thinking I was Keyleth, I'm gonna come up next to Keyleth. No, against the wall. Yeah. Don't let the slimes hit you. Oh my gosh. That's a big hit! (whispers) Oh my god. What? What's happening? Woot woot! Plus fire. Ooh! That's good! 24? Plus, do you add that to anything? Ever. We're gonna die. Oh no. Ugh. Why didn't you get acid damage? Oh. No! Nobody attack the things up close! Oh, no! All of our heavy hitters are dead. Oh, hit it! Get it! Why is it going up there? Did they vote on this? You guys suck. Plus acid? Oh my god. Clarota, save us! Do not use Lightning Bolt. Yeah. Yeah! And it dies? Yeah, Scanlan! I'm full. Yeah! Damn it. Did he take acid damage? Is he hurt? Nice. Good, good, good. No, there is two little oozes and a big one. Into the lava. Woo, Scanlan. TRAVIS and Okay. I'm gonna Lightning Bolt the bad guy. Yeah. Oh wait, no, I should save my brother. Okay, I'm going to attack one of the oozies instead. The one right behind him. Yeah. Yeah, 23. Oh I Hunter's Mark him first. Bonus. 14 for the first attack. Do I get six on both attacks? I do, don't I? Yeah. 17 on the second attack. Yeah. Yeah. Yay, blink belt. (sings) Shake it off. Yeah. Woo! Grog! Awesome. Save Grog! Don't challenge them. No. We're not gonna have Trinket this whole thing. We better get back to Trinket soon. I'm freaking out, you guys. That makes me so sad! And it's all you guys' fault! You did, Grog! Good job! Also, handful of pizza. Yay! Brother. I feel fine. To everyone. Well done, well done. Oh! Limping. That's great! Ah! See! That was acid-resistant, too! (gasps) My, my, Grog! Oh no! What about the black armor? Put on the dwarven black plate armor! If it's magical, it might fit you if you just try it on! (gasps) Oh, good! Oh! Ew. Cover yourself, Vax! Oh, okay. I can. He's got his own armor. Plus we have other plate armor! Yeah. Yay, Grog! It's his, he's keeping it. It's going to stink like Grog, you won't want that back. Ew. Oh, great, so there could be more. Yeah! Loot the ogres! Sweet. I add it to party funds. Yeah. Mother bitches. (gasps) Trinket! Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. So we're-- We'll go get Trinket, and then we'll go down the path we should have gone down in the first place next week. But Trinket! It was absolutely useless. We got our bear back. He's with me, and he cast Featherfall. Come, Trinket, come. Aboleth? We spent a whole game doing-- Flexing our muscles. Plus you got us new armor out of it. Man, oh man, oh man. Yay! 19? Oh, okay. You? Is that a total party kill?
