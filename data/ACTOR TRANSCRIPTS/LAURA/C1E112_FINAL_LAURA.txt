We got these. (cheering) It's Dalen. Yeah, because you said it wrong. Speaking of Talks Machina, though-- No, that wasn't Talks Machina. When I announced these shirts on Talks Machina. My brain. There's a new shirt for Talks Machina. You should check it out in the store. It's got "Stay Turnt" on it. It's a thing for Talks Machina. 8-Bit Foster! Have you seen it, Ashley? Also, there's all the other stuff that I always say. Look at that pretty face! He did such a good job with the dialogue. We've been freaking out. We're going to say hi. What are we doing there? Yeah, he is. I'm going to take pictures. Yeah, we need to keep going up. Oh, somebody needs to heal Scanlan. No, it was the same side. I think it's more like when your toe was missing. I think it's like that. But what if you needed that? We need to keep going forward. Either try to make it up this tunnel, or we can try going down that path that the Sphere was forming. I don't know what that is. TRAVIS. It didn't go all the way. It just started. I looked. A chunnel? What's a chunnel? So forward then, huh? Where's everybody at health-wise? Are you solid? Pike? How are you? You got hit a couple times in that last fight. All right. That's up to us. We could take 30 minutes or just keep moving. Should I do Pass Without a Trace, because they might have some inkling suspicion that we're on-- Well, I've got one level two spell left and all my level threes. I can cast it at a higher level, because most of my spells are pointless at this point. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace. Everybody's got plus ten to their stealth. I'm bamfing him back out. Yeah, but we've got Pass Without a Trace. Yes. Are we in a dark tunnel? They can't see us, right? Should we put out your hands? So that they can't see us? Well, there's a bunch of people off in the distance. Yeah, but you have to stay within 30 feet of me-- 30 if you want to keep Pass Without a Trace. 60 to stay within the ring. Let's stick around to the sides. It's sitting on top of it? That's the city? The roots of the city crushing down-- So we could go up from here? This is where we go up. You can get that sphere again and tunnel up. I know, we go straight into the city. We've only gone a little bit. Is it noisy? How far away from it do we have to be in order to not hear the hum? No, put them on us. I'm going to instantly throw a robe over top of Scanlan. You've got a robe on you now. I put a robe on, too. Yeah. Yeah, we look like we're with them. And I'm listening for voices. Do I hear anything? Oh, 19. We're not within the distance of 80, so they wouldn't be able to hear the orb. Definitely. We could collapse all the rest of the tunnels and we go straight up into the city. Yeah, let's send it off towards one of those torches. Can we see any light from above us? So the option is really to keep moving forward and find our way out. There's three ways. Can we scry on the death knight or on Delilah to see if they're with Vecna right now? Because if they're separate from him, then what if they're in these chambers? He probably would be less aware. If you scry on Delilah-- We can scry through the ring, right? Hold on. I have to find it. Band of Shrouds. While attuned, all creatures and their belongings within 60 feet of the bearer are immune to most divine magics that would locate or reveal the whereabouts of the creature. Most divining magics. That doesn't mean we're immune to everything. Well, maybe. What else does she see? You were scrying on the death knight, not Vecna! There was that moment when you two were falling to your deaths before we entered the titan. You were away from me, so it's possible that he knows. Do we see any other tunnels that aren't guarded? Whoa. That's a big fat no. We can totally try that. He did have a name. What was the name? You wrote it down. Yeah, you wrote it down. Odell. Be like, we're going to tunnel in this one now, so move. This is true. We're going to be within 60 feet of you, very stealthily. No, we're going to say we're going to tunnel in that area now, so they have to clear out or else they'll be caved in. Not people, don't let anyone know there's people, but there's definitely something interesting. We're going to hide. As we get closer, I can use Hide in Plain Sight and camouflage all of us to where they can walk by us and they won't see us. They're 120 feet from us? Okay, we'll move forward a bit, and then I can camouflage all of you. Because he's going to tunnel in that tunnel. Odell was the one holding the sphere, right? Odell wasn't holding the sphere. Gray. Yeah, it was gray. Hold on, I pull it out and look at it. Yeah, it was gray. Yeah, does it have his name written in it anywhere so he keeps track of it? Oh, this is pretty good. 24. This is the gray robe. It was gray, the guy that was controlling the orb. No! The red guy was holding the orb. The green guy put up the force wall and ran away. The red robe. I'm looking at the red robe. I don't know! We don't know. Okay, so that's not the one we want; we want the one in red that was controlling the orb. No, don't say that there's anybody that they need to watch out for. Don't set them on alert! No, tell them you found something interesting and Odell is investigating it. They need to go down into the tunnel to help him. You definitely need help for it. Vecna's going to be thrilled! Everybody's going to get promotions. So we sneak forward. Trinket's going back into his necklace. It's too dangerous, buddy. So as soon as we get within a hundred feet of them I'm going to do Hide in Plain Sight on everybody and camouflage everybody so that they-- On top of Pass Without a Trace. Hide in Plain Sight. Just to disguise everyone so that they're super hidden. I can use my ranger skills to cover people! We're keeping within Pass Without a Trace. To see if I can actually do it? I know. Eight. Oh, a wisdom saving throw or a check? So we have to stay within 30 feet of me. Scanlan, stay within 60 feet of me. Yeah, you can do the jenga. What do we do if it's jenga? Can you cast something to help his charisma and his persuasion? An hour. It's plus ten! I got 43. You shouldn't have given them the Sphere. Yeah, but we have to cave it in, and they're going to see. We're going to cave it in after them. We did. Should we still cave it in, though, behind them? We can definitely take the skeletons out, though, and sneak through, potentially, in that one tunnel. We should still cave this shit in, and it'll seem like a natural cave-in, right? Probably. But should we cave in this fucking tunnel so that they can't come back through? Don't go too far from me! Don't keep walking fucking away from me! Every time you move forward, I have to move forward. You can inspire yourself! What if you're crazy? I'm going to wait until it passes by me to whisper into my earring. (whispering) Maybe if we all go down the middle tunnel, then we can collapse that tunnel behind us. Yeah. We make a run for it and then collapse the tunnel. Because the other two tunnels are going to see us once we get in the middle. We stealth around the other side. Can you collapse the one they went down? Then we'll collapse ours, too. Because the thing is a Sphere that can-- Collapse tunnel one. We still have to collapse the tunnel. Let's do it and go! Yes. Once they're all in there, we block them in. Are you sure? Those seem like the most powerful ones. So after that's up, we all move as a group in that direction so we're within 60 feet of each other. What do they look like from this distance? So we should kill her. Wait, is it an automatic crit because it's surprise? Sweet! So 30 for attack. 19 times two is 28 plus eight is 36 damage on my first arrow. Second attack. No, 38. 19 times two is 38 plus eight. 46! Yep. That was one, so for my second arrow-- I'm going left. So 31 to hit. 19 on the left. Thanks. Yeah because we're going to tunnel this shit anyways, right? Can I shoot the skeletons that are approaching? 26 and 27 to hit. We can see the sky and we're causing the collapse behind us? We're up at Thar Amphala? Can we slow down at all, or do we have to keep booking it to avoid the cave-in? 18. So we can slow down. I still got Pass Without a Trace because I didn't cast Hunter's Mark. Is there any city on the way to Vasselheim? We have to get these shields down. Vax? Does it look like anyone has noticed the noise coming from this tunnel? How is it even flying? Do any of them seem to have noticed this tunnel? Then come back down here. So what's the plan here, guys? Potentially. I have Locate Object. So that we can see it, so we can locate it. Well, we'll find out when we scry on it, won't we? I haven't. I focus on the Sword of Kas. I'm thinking of so many other things, but I'm really trying to focus on this sword, okay? Penises, dicks. No, Sword of Kas! Sword! It's buried. Does it seem like the dirt that surrounds the Shadowfell? Is it that kind of dirt? Oh no, now I'm thinking of dicks again! Hold on. Sword! I'm focusing! Okay, but I did get a good look at it, at least? Okay. All right, thanks, stone! It was not being held by that knight. No. It was buried somewhere. I'm going to give Vax a super detailed description. I don't know if it helps, but I know we can both cast Locate Object. Yeah, but I'm giving you a really detailed description! We're twins! Look into my mind! Have you scryed on any of us, without us knowing? Oh, when you were missing and we didn't know if you were safe or not. Okay, I'm going to cast Locate Object and envision the Sword of Kas to see if it's around us. I cast it at 3rd level, though, because I used up all my 2nd. So underground. So we don't have to go above ground to find it. Do you guys want to spend time getting this sword? It's super important to fighting Vecna. What about the earth elemental thing that you were going to do? Can you still do that and tunnel with that? You can't take me with you if you glide through the earth, can you? It's that direction. Which is why Keyleth is clutch. It's within a thousand feet. Right? Yeah, no, I only sense things within a thousand feet. What if I point Keyleth in the direction? Can you glide as an earth elemental and find it that way? Oh, it can't? If only somebody hadn't sent it away! Which is, by the way, chasing behind us still. Maybe see if you can sense it right now. See if you can take it back right now. Keep trying. I'm going to have to keep casting it. Whatever, but yeah. I've got another idea. But your idea led to this idea. It's a building process. What if Keyleth took one of the Gate Stones, glided down there as an earth elemental, grabbed the sword, and then bamfed back to us. An earth elemental. That's why Keyleth could do it. I can send her in a direction. But I would help her find it. How long does it last? We have to have both. I explain exactly what it looked like. Plus, If I give you a direction, you can tunnel in that direction, you can earthglide in that direction until you find the sword, grab a hold of it and try to bamf back. Let's try that. I'll point you in a direction. We tunnel towards the fucking sword. We know the direction. Go in that direction. In the direction that I'm pointing. Tunnel that way. And then I can cast it again twice. I have two more times to cast it. No, she can keep going that direction and then I'll cast it again in a little bit. You can't sense anybody in the mansion. Then we go away. We don't try to fight it. Avoid it, yeah. Let's do it. The sphere is coming out soon. Probably. We need to get out. Let's peek up. Is anything near us right now? No, we don't! We peek up first to see if anything's near us. 27. Is there anything around? Still Pass Without a Trace. I recast it! It's okay. I recast it. 46. We have to hide it, yeah. Can I help him find a place that would be hidden? Oh, I'm so glad! It's going to be so great. Put it in a cupboard. All right, it's that direction. If we don't come back, save Vasselheim on your own and the entire world. Yeah. Another one? You have plus ten. Intelligence? 12. Go underground! I'm going to cast Locate Object one more time. Oh, that that takes me out of stealth, doesn't it? And I point in the direction and have her keep following it. Is there an abandoned-looking building or anything I can duck into? Okay, then I'm going to duck under something so I can cast the spell and then re-stealth before I come back out so I don't bamf in the middle. Yes. I want to re-stealth and move until I'm directly over it. 33. Did she just yawn? Okay. I'm going to tap my foot on the ground and point directly down to you, Keyleth. Oh, does she still have the earring on? Any luck? You don't know where it is? Can I give her an idea of how deep down it feels, how far away it is? Would I be able to see the sword, though, if I was on another plane? Do I get your thing of plus two because I'm standing next to you? 13. Great! And I would know when it's right on me because I can sense that much, at least. Put that shit on me, then. I don't know. Is it like Sauron? Is he going to be able to see me? Okay. Can I sink into the ground? The ground is hard. She's not 60 feet away. I'll stay 60 feet within the surface of the earth. So I would disappear? I would fall? Can I cancel it once it starts getting on me and I'm like, this does not seem right? I might just be gone. I can? I'm on another plane of existence, though? I didn't think about the fact that it works in a different fucking plane. No, it's okay! I've got the thing. I'm just floating downwards. Can I float or am I stuck on the surface of the ground? Okay, I'm going to go down towards where the sword is. Can I sense Keyleth at all? I can't see her, right? Okay. I keep going towards the sword. I can't touch it. But I know where it is. Can I come up into the cavern, and you said there was rock outcropping that I can stand on? Can I get this shit off of me, the oil off of me, or am I stuck as an ethereal form? It lasts-- No, not necessarily. I have the stone. This could work. You guys are in the mansion. Yeah, we're good. I don't know if there's anything wrong, so you keep tunneling down and I'll wait. Come on. It's been an hour? Oh, the Locate Object, right. Keyleth! Keyleth! I'm right here! Keyleth! Keyleth! Over here! I'm over here! Yes! Yeah! (laughing) How long has it been? I can't do shit! I can't interact with anything! I'm just fucking standing here! 15 minutes. This is the best. I described where it was to you, so I described that it was murky water. Muck is what I described to you. It's surrounded by silt, is what it felt like. Keyleth, it's right here! It's right here! It might be poisonous water; I'm not sure what it is. Can you hear me? It's right here. Vecna can probably hear him. I sit down on the ground Indian-style. It's acid. I can hear you. It is definitely acid. I'm fucking sitting on the ground; there's nothing else I can do. Can I see any of this happening? Okay. Shit. Trinket's still in my necklace. I wonder if I bamf him out-- he wasn't covered in oil-- if he'd be in the regular plane or if he would be in the Ethereal Plane. Would he be an ethereal bear, or would be bamf out in the regular plane? I don't know how this shit works. I'm going to bamf Trinket out of the necklace. I don't know how this fucking shit works. I'm going to try to bamf Trinket out of the necklace. I was basically trying to let her know where I was. Can you chill? Right here. Because this is where I am. Can we wait it out? This was the stupidest idea we've ever-- MARISHA and Trinket, get back in the necklace. You're such a good bear. Okay. That's it. But here's the thing, should you glide back to the mansion, I stone back to the mansion with the sword? Okay, give me the sword. Okay! You can glide back to the mansion. Okay. Good luck. And I'm going to think of the stone. I already put Trinket back in the necklace. Okay. All right, I pick up the stones and go in the mansion. Oh, he would've-- This was really stupid. We were so dumb. This was so dumb. I have the sword, yeah. There you go, Grog. Okay, so here's the thing. He knows we're here. He knows that you two are here. He doesn't know the rest of us are. We can Plane Shift. Will you be able to get us back here, though? Or to Thar Amphala? Oh god. Don't do it! Go to the pond. That sword better be the most amazing sword. Yeah, where the water elemental is. Are we fucked? No, I took all the gate stones. Yeah, but it doesn't go through planes. You can definitely hear the sword? I like that you grab it by the blade. So it's balanced. Oh no! Did we just lose Grog? Grog! What are you doing? (shouting) Wait, Kas! Is this Kas? Are you Kas? Kas, this is counterproductive. This is counterproductive! We're all going after Vecna! This is so stupid! You are ruining your chance of killing Vecna by attacking us. You're a fucking dick. Your sword is a dick. Tell him he's a dick. I punch Grog across face. With my strength modifier? 14. It's minus. Act like it hurt, you fuck! Oh, the sword is a dick! That's funny. Good? Bad? Pike, do you think it's worth it? He's into slicing us up. It went bad before. Are you always like that now? Grog, you need to eat something. You look really gaunt. I'm really glad that we're here in the Feywild, and it's great. What are we doing? (singing) D.A.R.E to keep a Grog off Kas! No, not anymore. Time gets a little wonky here. Is there a way to control it? No, he was great! Yeah, he was funny, and he also helped us, and he also enjoyed us because we were weird. You can get it later, right? Okay. Maybe Artagan can identify it. You think he could do that? I don't know if he's going to be able to control time, though. It's also possible that we'll return and years have gone by and Vecna is already a god. Oh, that's true. Maybe he'll want to help if he can? (gasps) I'm going to cry. That would be so wonderful. (stuttering) It was a thing. I'm so sorry that Vecna found us. The ethereal thing was a backfire. How do we get a hold of-- To Garmelie? Yeah, draw a little naughty doodle, Pike. Is it boobies? Is it penis? It's a novel. To killing Vecna? Let me see it! Okay, what did you draw? What did you draw, Pike? He's a happy penis! Oh, it's so great! Okay. I shimmy. It's been a little crazy, actually. We were hoping that maybe we could seek your aid? Please? Okay, so you know how time is weird when we go back to the other plane of existence? Exactly. It's so much fun. We're in dire straits over there. The world is about to be taken over by an asshole that wants to be a god, and we're trying to kill him, and we're here now, and we're hoping that we can hang out here and rest and go back and only a few seconds have passed? Maybe a minute or two? We definitely do want to show you a good time about it. You can do that? We have a bakery. We found this ball of light. Crystal. Good point. Will you come back? Have we tested this? It's Keyleth that's sending us back, and she can. Is is Artagan or Artagan? You don't? You've had access, but you were blocked? You're not going to become addicted to strangling people because you've tried it on him. He's not allowed to talk? I don't want to see it. Let him do it. You'll come back, right? Gross, stop! Of course, darling. See you in a bit. Artagan, this is weird as fuck. All right. I slowly walk away. Yeah, I'm going to swim. We're swimming naked while my brother is dying. No big. I'm so glad we can't see this. Oh my god! Oh. Is it safe to rest? Okay. (whimpers) Should we wait? We need to wait 24 hours to bring him back. It takes 24 hours? It was that night. All right, well. Okay. Yeah, this is crazy. Yeah, let's set up camp here. We know this area. Oh shit. Nice. (sighs) Yeah, but we need to do a feast before we go back. Well, the thing is, it uses a spell, so it has to be within the 24 hours. Okay, but I want Vax to have the feast, as well, so-- We don't know how long it takes. We can try to wait and see how long it takes and then rest? Let's give it some time. This feels weird to play. You can sense them? Hey, Artagan. Does killing a wannabe god sound fun to you? It would be much more fulfilling than strangling a person that didn't fight back, right? Would you want to come through with us? Oh. You have to have a specific doorway. Okay. And that's a time-consuming sort of thing? Sylas is alive. Sylas is back. Yeah, didn't you see him right before we left? He was right in front of Delilah. We killed him. Wasn't it Pike who killed Sylas or was it you? It was you. Oh, that's right, and you said "eat a bag of dicks." Great, so he's back. What can we accomplish? What can we do? There's got to be something we can do. What do you need to do? What is it? Like a mount sort of situation? You can turn an animal into a wyvern? Any animal? Bigger than Trinket? Is it permanent? Oh, never mind, then. Trinket? Would you want to be turned into a wyvern? Hold on, let me see if I've got Speak With Animals. I don't think I have it. It's 1st-level, I can still do it! Trinket? Would you want to be turned into a wyvern forever? (whispering) Say no. It's like a lizard that's really big that's got wings. Not so much? Okay. Just checking. I just wanted to make sure. It's your choice, darling. No, he said no. You haven't been saying shitty things to my bear, have you? Trinket, don't ever listen to him. He's horrible. Like what?! Like another Artagan? Would they be fully capable to cast all your spells? Oh shit! Oh my god, what kind of spell is this? A real thing that could be killed right out from under him, though. And then Grog would fall. Not with that sword. Well, but so could one of us. Like what?! (laughter) Completely? Oh, Death Ward. Pike can cast that. Plus, we all have our blessings-- not all of us. We have some blessings from gods that will activate, hopefully, right before. And another attack. You can't? Hey, Pike, do you know Haste? Okay. Awesome. It certainly made us opening a doorway so he can get into the real world a little bit more questionable. We still did it! We still got it! Ashley, your drawing was amazing. No, don't do that. Please don't do that.
