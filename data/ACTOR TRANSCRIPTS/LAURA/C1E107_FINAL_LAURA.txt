Merchandise! I just finished organizing it, you guys. Okay. I wanted to give you guys some updates on some merch items. Those amazing posters? They will be sent out in a week. I think. Yes. They will be sent out in a week, because they're in the warehouse now, ready to get shipped. I've gotten a lot of messages asking where are the aprons? And the reason that they're not shipped yet is because we ended up selling so many that the manufacturer didn't have enough cloth to make the aprons, so then there was a backlog of that. So they're done, and they're about to get to the warehouse so you'll be getting your aprons in a couple weeks, and then we'll start getting them, so that's solid. Also, we have these awesome necklaces. Also, some other stuff. So it's going to be a canon episode? What if we all die at the live show? I like how we all assumed it was going to be Sam that was dead and flying above the audience. Wait, no! I thought he'll be back by then. No? Happy birthday, bb! There's no cake, y'all. It gets you, right? Yeah, that's what happened to me that day. (raspy singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat-- I don't fucking know. Yeah, right? That's where we have to go. Yes, so if we have a Heroes' Feast, that will take care of one thing. And I have two chalices because we never used the one. Yes, obviously. All of us? Even Trinket? And Pike? Oh no! Pike, but what if Vasselheim is attacked? That's really creepy. Seriously. Wait no, she has to prepare the Heroes' Feast for us before we say goodbye. Immune to fear and poison and advantage on wisdom checks. Do you guys want food now, or do you want to wait until the break? TRAVIS and That can regenerate? How long do your inspiring speeches last? Yay, how many did we get from that? Tell him we love him, and that we're okay for the time being. We're doing it live! Can I have one slice of breakfast pizza? He's like hold on. Okay, I guess we should exit the mansion. And then-- Above the water, over to the volcano. How do we do this? Okay, so once we're there, do we know exactly what we're doing? And the volcano's underwater. Is that what the schtick is with it? So it's an active volcano that we're diving into? Solid. I don't think there's time. Somewhere. We don't know where, exactly. No, we don't know if she's there, we don't know if she's with Vecna. I know, at least! Look at this! You guys! We go to the shore, then we climb up the volcano, then we dive into the volcano? But there's smoke coming out of it! I thought maybe the top was coming out of the water. I got it. I think either Percy or I. You. You. Thanks, Pike! That's convenient. Yes, of course. Is this going to be like the kraken fight? Are we going to be underwater fighting again? You weren't there. We almost fucking died because you weren't there with us, Scanlan. I hated you at that moment. Scanlan. If you die, I'm going to be really upset. I get the fuck back up again! You're Hercules Mulligan! Are there spells designed to mask you? Yeah, so people can't see us. Do you know of anything like that, Scanlan? Yeah, because Vecna's fucking watching us. Yeah, all the fucking time. Yeah. Are we on the water? What do our elven eyes see? Can we see the smoke? That was a Legolas reference, in case you were wondering. A perception check? 20. Is he pointing in a general direction? I look where he's pointing. Can I see anything? Damn it. I pull out a piece of gold. Do you know where the volcano is? Do you want to make some gold? Then can you tell me where the fucking volcano is? Paltry sum? How much gold do you see every day? I pull out another piece. Is this enough? All I want to know is where the volcano is. No. Yeah, I'm going to look real hard. We're a thousand feet up. Can't we spell ourselves out there? We should rent a ship. All right, here's three more gold. How about that introduction? You're not the tallest yourself, you know. Fuck it! Fuck it, I'm not disguising him because of what he looks like! Fuck that. Of course I am! I don't care. That was a different reason, and if your fucking dock mistress is such a bitch that she won't give us a good deal because of him then we'll find someone else. I mean, it's up to you, but I don't think you should do it. Sure, yeah, probably be less than that but three days, sure. Great. Wonderful. Of course, and you have something to sign. I'm sure Percival can draw something up. How much do ships normally cost? 600 is very low. But it was far less than this. Yes, of course. I agree, but an entire ship I feel like would be more than 600. Yeah, so she's giving us a really good deal. Maybe you should amend that in the contract. Yeah. That's fine. (bling) Oh, it sounds elegant. I have a feeling you don't believe this ship will make it back, do you? Of course. Yep. You strapping young lads are taking us out to the volcano. The Shore Shanty? Captain Santy of the Shore Shanty? I love it! Only taller. Great. How long would it take to go five miles on this fabulous ship? I'm going to keep an eye on where the little guy said the volcano was and try to make sure our drunk captain is taking us to the right place. You're Mary Ann, you're Professor. There's no way to go any faster on this? Is there no way to go faster, Captain? Do you go out to this volcano often? Lovely. Oh, you found it. Very deep. Is your chain long enough for your anchor to hit bottom? Cool. Oh, and Trinket! I had him in the necklace because it was such a tiny little boat, but now he's out. Oh wait, can he swim? He's good. He did it before, right? He's an expert now after the kraken fight. The red light? I'm useless and Percy's useless underwater. I'll be just behind Percival. He's out. He's swimming. I'm equalizing. Really? Your ears wouldn't pop, still? Oh, right. Okay, cool. Oh, good. We can't communicate. You called him Vex. (garbled) We didn't think about fire resistance, did we? Does anybody have any light? We really need to say stuff, though, because no one's going to be able to understand us. (laughter) Scanlan, don't you have Dancing Lights or anything? (garbled) Don't you have a Dancing Lights cantrip or some shit like that? (garbled) Lame. Can you make yourself a fire elemental, and it won't damage you if you go-- or will water fuck with you? Yeah. It might be magma coming out, though. Yeah, do that. That's smart! Yeah. Man-made tunnels. Any dangerous creatures in the area. And where are they? But maybe it'll know how far away it is, even though it can only-- Does it work that way? Oh, okay. There you go. So we need to go in the top, yeah? Oh, we can understand you. No, it doesn't do anything in-- it flies. I can try. But it flies. Yeah. It'll just sit. Fuck. How long did that take? With no water? There are tunnels here. Maybe we can go around the perimeter and see if we can find some sort of entrance. Some magical-looking entrance. Do you know, Percival, what it looks like? Did you see it in your mind's eye? Through the mountain? Through the volcano, instead of down the top, like he just did. Solid, then let's try it. Are they resistant to water and heat? Solid. Let's not do that just yet. Let's control current and see if we can fucking do it, with some light this time. Ten. Hey! You're smart, Grog! So we can get through it? Yeah, Grog can punch. Don't you get advantage? Don't you get advantage because of your gauntlets? Let's get in quick and then cover it. We go fast, go in. Well, didn't you say there was an air pocket? Yeah, I go in after him. I like how everything is like, "Keyleth can do this." Can you wall it off with Create Wall? Yay! Which are brighter now because we're not in water. That was fucking sick! Oh, because you don't breathe. Oh, great! So any time we need a breath we just breathe, okay! I take a breath and I start looking for a door or any way out of this. 18. (gasps) Is it wide enough for all of to fit through? Hey! There's a tunnel down there! Let's take it a little slow because we don't know what we're coming up to, though. I don't want to jump full-force into-- Something like that. Lead the way, darling. Let's just go in the water. I follow him. Although Percy should technically be up front because he's got light. Trinket is behind Grog. I know! Can you see by the light of the magma? What did you see? Up and over. Let's-- yeah. Let's go up there. Can we cast Locate Object on the anvil? Don't you have something that sends a direct path to an object? Oh fuck. Were there any other pockets of water along the way? Does your creepy undead brain remember how long it takes before we die if we don't breathe? Do you remember that? Does your Raven Queen regenerate lost footsies? Two minutes. Ugh, two minutes. Yeah. All right. Grog? Are you good to run and jump over some lava? (laughs) Oh no. Okay, but you were on foot. If I'm on the broom, then maybe it wouldn't take as long, potentially. Okay. I'm going to put Trinket in the necklace. Do you want to get on the broom with me? All right, anybody? Scanlan? (gasps) Sick! Try breathing it. Oh, smart. We do have an extra chalice. You know what? I'm going to take the fancy chalice and-- as needed. I pop Scanlan on the broom and we fly on over. I think there's something burrowing. Or an earthquake. Potentially. I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. Wow. 25. Trinket's in the necklace. (whispers) I get my bow ready. Oh, is it a worm? A purple worm? Oh no! There's three of them! You should have just done it! No! Trinket's in the necklace. We were on the broom. This is really cool. Oh god, it's huge! Grog! Little baby bulette. Do we remember what its weaknesses were? Oh, 20. Does it realize that anybody but Grog is there? We could have, potentially. Oh god. I'm going to try to hit it with a Lightning Arrow. What do you mean? I'm going to try to hit the one that's breathing on Grog. But it knows you're there! Maybe it doesn't know I'm there! Plus I get a sneak attack on it, because you're right next to it. And I'm going to Hunter's Mark it! (laughs) I say! 25! Lovely. So if that was a 3rd-level Lightning Arrow, then that means I get 3d8 lightning damage in addition to my regular damage, or is it just 3d8 lightning damage? Wait. Roll the attack as normal, the target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit. Oh, and every creature within ten feet makes a dexterity saving throw. Okay. If I cast it at 4th-level, so no, it's just 3rd-level. Wow. Really? Nine plus-- 15. It doesn't actually do my regular arrow attack damage? It's just-- wow. My spells are useless compared to my regular attacks. 15 damage. You still made your save. Five. That's five total. I'm going to try to hit it again, then. Oh, and I did Hunter's Mark. Oh, so I did Hunter's Mark-- no. Oh. I am never going to do spell attacks ever again. They're worthless for me. Okay. Okay, then I'm going to attack it with a regular-ass arrow that does more damage, probably-- natural 20-- than a fucking Lightning Arrow. Okay. Lovely. Sweet. That's seven. 14 plus eight is 22, 24, plus lightning damage. 24 plus five is 29 damage with a regular arrow. Yes. No, I get two sneak attacks! Plus another four. 29 plus four. 33. No, that's regular. Can I get on my broom? I get on my broom. How much? Are these monsters or beasts? You want to move? There's lava! Careful! Why would you? So? It's still in your blood. You did, actually! That's right. Wow. Did it feel weird to have somebody else moving the people? Oh shit! 19. How many? I've got five here. 17. Yes, so you're at 17 now. You've got another one here. Right here? Okay, I'm going to Hunter's Mark it! And then I'm going to attack it with an arrow. (old woman voice) Bramble Shot! (old woman voice) Bramble Shot! (normal voice) 25! Oh! Can I do sharpshooter and do minus five to hit, plus ten to attack? This one is a Bramble Shot and it's a 25 to hit. Okay, cool. Five plus eight is 13, 14, 15. 15 plus sneak attack and lightning damage. 15, 19, 23, 25, and then 4d8 piercing damage. 32. And then he has to make a strength saving throw. Then he succeeds. I attack him again. This time I'm going to try as a sharpshooter! Okay! Natural 20! And it's a Bramble Shot. Do I have to say that before, too? Motherfucker. So yeah! Okay, cool! All right! Right. I'm going to roll all my dice, and then double that, then add my extra things. How about that? All right, Matt. Okay, so 11, 14, 20, 23, 25, 50. That's easy. 58, 60. Oh, plus ten because it was sharpshooter. 70! I didn't add the Hunter's Mark damage. Well, only extra two damage for that. No, I'm going to move on my broom so he doesn't know I'm there. I'm going to fly to here. Happy birthday! Whoa, what is that? I don't think we've seen this. But we haven't seen it! Haven't seen it up close. Oh, Grog is scary as fuck! I'm sorry; you're scary! Okay. Put me down? Just vault over it. Are you naked with a sword hanging from your hip? He didn't shake them, you just put them on down. That was the shadiest roll ever. If you did that in Vegas, they'd be like, "No." Maybe you can make it a pet. No, that was it. The Core Anvil is going to float up from the magma. Wow. Very observant of you, Grog. Can we see now because of all the glow coming from-- does magma glow? Oh. I'll use my chalice. What? Why? Do you still have Heroes' Feast? You're 12 feet tall, so you're hitting the ceiling? Should I try flying down there with the broom? I'm going to recast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, P.S. Oh, in our brains? I like it. Are you still you, Scanlan, just in another body? It's weird that you're nine feet tall, but your penis is still a cube. Sorry. Yes. Lead the way. The Allhammer was-- Watch over us. That was all in our heads? Yeah, let's go. How often can you re-up that jar? Oh god, it's nasty water. Should we head down there? Did it seem like you could pass through that door? You didn't try to get through it? It's all right. We can find a way. It's just a door. I am flying down with the broom. Does anybody else need to ride? Do you need to bamf your wings out, or do you want to get on the broom? Can we reopen it? Bust through this shit or undo it? Do we have a way to cancel the seal out? Can I pray to Pelor? I'm going to pray to Pelor. I don't know if it makes a difference. I'm going to say well. We are here at a doorway. I don't know if you speak to the Allhammer, if you know anything about this, but if you have any way to help us get through this, now would be the time. Trying to do good work here for you and all of mankind. Oh yeah. Well, I'm going to take the bean out and say all that shit again with the bean in between my hands. I'm going to whisper it to the bean because it's part of him. That's why it was so good. Thanks. Are they glowing runes? Are they magical runes? Do they seem like they're magic? You're little. Or you could have-- Oh yeah, could you have stretched to either side and he does a Ninja Warrior shit down the tube? Well, that's what I mean. What about a Wonder Woman situation where you (impacts). Because you got the siege gauntlets on? And you make handholds? Yeah, sure, that's what I did. Popped Trinket out, flew back up, grabbed Grog, came back down. Is there a door knob or anything that looks like a seal? 18. Maybe you could push it? Check for traps! Would my greedy eyes know what kind of metal it is? Intelligence. Investigation? (laughs) Oh! Ten. I did cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us again a while ago. I said it. I even marked it off after the fight. Your one-inch cube suddenly grows. I'm going to think in my head, Scanlan's the best. Scanlan, darling. You're fucking hot right now, all right? But I love you like you were. You're always my favorite when you're just yourself. I mean, just part of my armor. If that's not boots, then it's probably just the front guards, huh. But I've got my broom. That I just said I was on. You want to hop up on this broom? All right. It looks awkward, but stay there, if you'd rather. Did you lose your earring because you're an angel now? Stop being creepy, Scanlan. They're drawings? I want to look at them, too. I want to fly up on my broom. I was going to say it and then he said it. Investigation? 22. I'm going to be stealthy. I don't want to be noisy. 32. Yeah, you had said 15. I'm going to go up behind Percy. If he fucking brings it up to a god. He doesn't even realize he has it. What are you fucking talking about? Would Trinket's little feet hurt if he was on the ground? Well, I figure I would have tried to put him out when we got in the tunnel, but if his feet were hurting, I would have put him back in the necklace. Okay, I'll keep him in, then. How high off the ground is that relief? I think you're supposed to stick your hand in it, Grog. Does it look like anything's supposed to go in the triangle? Does it look like a keyhole? Can we see how deep the hole goes? I want to get close to it on my broom and look at it. Okay. All right. I back up so that I'm not in the fumes. Oh, that's where we have to smelt the platinum. Do we see anything around the room that looks like it could fit in that pyramid shape? You mean, you'll stay like that forever? You can't undo it? And we can get to the smelter right now, or it's beyond the crossbeams? All the shit we need? This is where Vox Machina dies because they can't figure out-- Yeah, to fit in those things. Yeah. Might as well. Yeah, we switched all our gold for platinum in Vasselheim. Can I fly up to the circle on the wall, on the crossbeams? Does it come off? We can't find anything that makes a triangle shape, a pyramid shape, in the room? Ooh, maybe we have to kill them and then smelt into their faces. All right. How tall are they? How big were they? And they're made out of metal? They're golems. It's still for another hour! Thank you, Magic the Gathering - Puzzle Quest. (laughs) Oh jeez. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.
