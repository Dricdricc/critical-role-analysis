And maybe his little paws can be on my shoulder the whole time I play? I saw something subs for bears. It's going to be a good show. That's good. That's very see-able. Oh we're going to be at Otakon this weekend in Baltimore. Come say hi! We're leaving right after this. I feel like we're just delaying starting because we're going to have to face that fact that Pike isn't with us as soon as we start. He's on his way, yeah. He's getting a drink. What is he wearing? Just for the next eight months? Should we go look at that statue, then? Pike's probably going to have to be the one to clean that up! Are you going to be able to see through the dump? We're not there. It's just Scanlan. He's just leaving it. Will she realize you can see her through the poop? Wouldn't that be great if she could just talk to you through the poo? Should we bunk for the night before we head out in the morning? I wanted to wander over to the statue while Scanlan was dumping. I feel like it's dark now. He's a dwarven god? And it's nighttime? So it's like a battleground? Have you ever fought in the Crucible? The money? Wait, it costs money? Keep walking? Thank you, friend. Sit-ups. Crunches. Hello. How would we enter a new fighter into this pit? 100 gold? Is that all? I'd love to. 500 gold on this one right here. You can't fight him yet! Four-to-one. You're going to get it, Grog. You're going to do it. I have faith in you. Oh my god. We're going to lose all our money on Grog. No we're not. Sing a song. Do you use arcane magic or do you use divine magic? Just sing a song, Scanlan. You're not supposed to kill him. No killing allowed in this? Wait, what was in that? Was that wine? Wait, does anybody have a Potion of Stoneskin or anything good? I can smell you from here, Kern! You only get half damage of a d4? You suck, Korn! You can throw some dirt in his face! Was he pointing at you? Oh god. How was that ten, baby? That was 11. The first one was a five. That's 11. I know. Oh, no. You distracted him. Yeah, he's only using his arms because he's got no knees! Douche. That was painful. It's too bad Pike didn't cast Death Ward on him before she left, though. That would've been great. We'll need to earn our money back. Is there a whorehouse here in Vasselheim? That is what I was inquiring. We'll get you ice cream, Grog, and a whore. How's that sound? Tiberius, really? We would love one of those. For some of us, not all of us. No. Our bear will stay in the room with us girls. No, Grog. Almost. Okay, yeah! Oh, Grog, come on. He's so upset. He's really upset. The heartache for our lost money. I'm pretty sure you just groped her. Do you need some breakfast or ale? All right. Little hair of the dog? Yeah? All right. Oh, this is the very special beer. It'll get you super drunk. Hi, good to see you, Keyleth. Well, we have multiple things we can be doing. We can go meet Keyleth's druid family in the mountains, right? Fire, brimstone, stuff like that. We have a lot of money waiting for us. In Kraghammer, yes, but there is 25,000 gold waiting for us, so that's always an option. Here, Grog. Have some clear beer. Good job, Scanlan. Yes, it's like a poop earring. So yes. There's multiple things. We can look for work here, we can go back to Bahamut, see if they want-- That's what I'm talking about, yes. Fire, brimstone, volcanoes. Druids. Secrety. To kiss? You kiss your family? There are things about goliaths I did not want to know. That water has a good effect on him. Inconvenience, schminconvenience. Yes. It's actually Underdark. I'm fluent. Yeah. Next time, bite his nose off right away before it's concave. The balls-- good effort. Speaking of weapons, aren't we in a perfect weapons-buying district? What about your beard? Is he growing his beard? Actually, I don't know about anybody else, but I'm incredibly low on funds at the moment. Getting ready where? What are we doing? Can I grab the flying carpet out of the Bag of Holding before you take off? I swing down and pick up my brother. Yeah, we fly up next to one of the shooter guys and say, what was it? What is it? What came back? Like a raptor. Kord help us. Good old Kord. Okay. Can we float up a little bit and see if we can see movement in the trees where it is? Okay. Well, here's the thing. I bring the carpet back down and say, I see where it went, if you guys want to fight it. What do you think? Polymorph him, please. Scanlan, please. Polymorph him. We can track him. I'm a ranger. I can definitely use my ranger skills. Oh, don't worry, he's really nice! Yeah. Why are you being an asshole to me today? I don't know! (laughter) Yeah, can I go low to the ground and track it? This is my other favored terrain. Oh, natural 20! (cheering) Is it big? I think it ate something here, you guys. Thank you. Should we continue on, keep tracking? Yeah, perception check around. Oh, that looks good. Yeah, only 18 for me. But wait, advantage. That's way better! 25. Should we follow along that path? But maybe off to the side a bit, like in the trees but next to the path? Oh man, another one? 16. What do I need to add? Okay, so 19. Perception? 18. Natural 20! Whoa. Is that a dragon? So it's not technically in the dragon school? It was a natural 20. Do I add anything? Should I have rolled for Trinket? I rolled an 18 for Trinket. I can cast the spike-growth thing again. In the water, then lightning the water? That's good. Drown him? Yeah. Box him in the water and then lightning the water. Do you want to go from either side? You take the carpet, go to the other side, and I'll walk over with Trinket to the other. What is he looking for? I'm going to do the same to the other side, actually. Would I be able to shoot him from behind the one further back? Well then I'll go behind the big tree. There, yeah. Totally hidden! Can you move Trinket next to Grog? There we go, look at us all. Strategized. I want to shoot him. Okay, I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on it. So I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns at 3rd level. I'm going to roll for that. Jesus. That's only 16. That doesn't hit, does it? Okay. Then I'm going to try just doing a regular attack through the magical bow of fire. And that is 17. Then never mind, I don't do anything. I just fucking fucked that up. Yeah, I want to climb a tree that I'm next to. What was that, athletics or acrobatics? Why? Six! I'm going to stay on the ground. Trinket's going to stay right there. 19. Wait, but when Hercules defeated him, he just cut off so many that they started attacking themselves and they got tangled up. Can I see its body at all? So I can't see its body. Okay, I'm going to shoot towards where-- is this bad? Oh no! I'm going to shoot towards where all of the heads are joined together. Yeah, down where all these heads are connected. Right here. I'm going to shoot my fancy exploding arrow. Oh god. Natural 20! You said 19? Jesus. All right. Can Trinket run up and fight alongside Grog? All right, he's going to do that. Gets two attacks because of bestial fury. Jeez. Okay, I'm going to roll my Trinket dice now. Don't kill me now. Okay. I don't even know. 16. Cool. 19. All right. (fake-cries) Okay. 13. Does he get Hunter's Mark? Yes he does! That's another five. Oh, you don't want to punch heads off. Blurs from the bush? What? Well, maybe you should've fought it before we got here! Wait, what about the people that are near the hydra? And it explodes in his face and he's knocked prone. Attack the hydra. Hey, that's the best thing ever! I bet if we keep doing it though, I mean, eventually the heads will outweigh the body and it'll just have to fall over. So everything in that area? You can't. You already did it! So 18 for the first one. I don't want to say it, but Trinket's right there. Yeah, I know you said that, but he also attacked him already. Don't say it. 17 for the first one. It's stuck in there. It was really on an angle. That's unfortunate because one of them was good, and one of them sucked. Seven. Trinket! I get up and run over to Trinket and hold his little head in my hands. Help him! Well, no, give us the money. Well, the Bastion up on the wall said we could, so that's why we did it. What do you mean? Aldor, they told us we could kill it and then give the heads and then bring it in and then they would give us money... Why don't you just tell people you killed it, we helped, you get the money, you give us half of it, and we call it even? Oh. Can you stab it right now? Maybe it's still breathing? No, Sean Connery's talking now. I'm sorry. I mean, I was going to ask them for a paycheck immediately after we'd gone back to the city, but you know. Ooh, can we help? Can I have a scale? Just one more scale? Oh, you guys set that bait out. You guys killed that ape, didn't you? Not intentional. Skags. It was attacking the wall. We were protecting you. I have enormous balls. Oh. He's got giant balls, as well. That would be amazing. Remember it. You two make an adorable couple. They didn't do much, but yes. We have a keep there. That's good, because otherwise they didn't get any credit, right? Because it was like, magically-- Yeah, let's do it. We're totally tough. What? Does my bear get to come with me? Wait, no. We work as a pair. Maybe you don't know that about us. Ever. Question, husband. Is there a way to change those little pairings that she made? Perhaps get my brother and I on the same team?
