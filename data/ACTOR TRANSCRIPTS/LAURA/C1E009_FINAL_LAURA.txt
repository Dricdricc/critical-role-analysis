Do you think you're smart? Oh, awesome! Oh, yeah! So now two Black Widows in the house. Yeah, cause we all do Avengers Assemble. On Disney XD. What what what! Thor, Black Widow, Red Skull. You bastard. And then the episode of TableTop that I did just dropped today, as well. Yeah. A very scary horror RPG. You're villains on everything, are you? Maybe we can get a chip implanted in him so we can track him all the time. Yeah. Or like one of those tiles you put on your keys. Perfect plan! Great... Great, Tiberius, go for it. (whispering) We're on our way. Yeah, and he's not stealthed enough. "Okay!" We stealth. Can I head that way? I rolled a nine, so it doesn't even matter. My first one was an ultimate fail. 25. Ugh, why? Why? Oh, I'm cursed today! Eight. Eight damage. Yeah, yeah. Will you buy me new dice as well? Thank you. I nod to you. Good job. Let's step up behind him. I want to step up and make him look more imposing with me and Trinket behind him. I want to step up behind Scanlan with a bear behind him, and make him look more imposing. (laughs) Whoa, you're huge! Hello! Do I roll for Trinket, too? 14. And Trinket is eight. Great. Oh, he rolled an eight. It's pretty shitty, you guys. It sucks. Oh, good. Trinket's about to die again. I don't roll anything because I'm stunned? I've got a 13. Oh, me. 13. I'm not a victim. I'm going to kick butt as soon as I wake up. Murder him! But he's awake, right? Are you dead? Kill him. An upgrade! Plus intelligence? 23! That's great, that's the end of my turn? Do I roll it for Trinket too? Little Trinket gets the little bitty dice. Oh, I don't think he got it. No, he still rolled an eight. Oh! Does that mean he takes more damage? Okay. He's dreaming of pain. I think that guy dated Clarota's ex-girlfriend. That's great. (gasp) Just running? Can I shoot him? Shoot him, Percy! Nice. Nice, Percy! Is that everybody's? Okay, yeah. Yeah, how do we get Grog out? Being carried by an earth elemental. Pike and Trinket, are they still stunned, or are they... better? Okay. Then I run over and try to see what I can do. Can I go try to mess with the things on-- Grog! Are you hurt? Maybe bust the wood on the bottom. I keep my arrow notched. In case she does come back. Oh, Pike! Can you heal Trinket. He's really almost dead. You failed what? Oh, good. I've been waiting for it. I release an arrow! 29. I Hunter's Mark her, as well. What is that? 13? 12! Plus... That's 16 total. We need to talk to her. It would be in your best interest to not struggle. (laughs) You're in no place to negotiate. So bad. Oh! Wonderful. Clarota, do you want to suck her mind? I'm already here. What is K'Varn? I didn't ask what he did, I asked what he is. I check her pulse. Does she have anything awesome on that we can take? Is she dead? Can we take her outfit? (laughs) Yeah, and we haven't used the yellow potion yet. No. Can I also check-- We already checked the queen? You already checked the queen? Can we check the elf and the dwarf that we knocked out, as well? I know, we should check on Grog. You're standing up? I'm so happy you're back with us. See? I told you it was Keyleth. It's where a hat goes. Oh, that's great for you. Did I find anything on the other people? Oh, wait, I get to go twice because it's Underdark. That was great. 16. What do you see, Kima? (gasps) Oh, no. He was already a thrall. Is that what they would've done to Grog? You look really manly now. Oh, it is? She's right here. (whispering) Do you not want to talk in front of Kima? No, that's awkward. Grog goes and distracts Kima. What? Why? We found her, but we can't leave without her. And now you want to abandon her? Keyleth, what's your problem with Kima? Okay, vibe. What did she do? She's been very tortured. Tortured, Keyleth. They're dead because they got captured. We're stronger. (laughing) Sneaky, sneaky Keyleth. I can't cheat, but I really want to listen. You are manly. I meant more manly. Keyleth, we're keeping him, K'Varn, from killing even more. All those creatures that have been coming up, Keyleth? We did make a deal. We'll keep the horn from leaving. Thanks, Tiberius. Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods; she preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages. [dramatic music] Thank you. Oh god, what? It's doughnuts. That's your city? I thought your people had thrown you out. Why so eager to get back? And if they don't? If not, you have a home with us. See, he slipped-of-the-tongue before and he screwed us over with a sneaky-sneaky! Clarota seems pretty excited to get home. I'm worried for him. Yes. I'm worried that they won't take him back, what that will do to his state. Would you fancy a trade, Kima? I have elven chainmail, if that would help you. I could take that leather armor off your hands? No, actually. The chainmail isn't right for me. (laughs) Stick figure... (laughs) Dang it, I should've done that before we-- The scars are cool! She's seen it already, brother. It got melted off. Aw, come on, not again! He's got a little pinkie nubbin! She should've done it before we went to sleep. It still smells amazing, so if you could just-- Clarota, are we planning on going to your village before we go see K'Varn, or are we going after K'Varn first? I'm confused. Oh, is he a mind flayer, then? I mean, is he like you? While that happens, can I use my Primeval Awareness to sense if I sense any dragons in the city coming up in front of us? So don't go to the temple. So enter the temple. Understood. Can I touch some of the crystals? Are they removable? The greed! The greed gets me. Tiberius, these look like the crystals on your staff. It's in the bag. It's all in the bag. Could you possibly move this very large, very heavy boulder for us? Pike! Can I perception around it before we do anything? It's a side path that's been blocked. Oh, did you see it?! It was there and it went like that! It was a 20 and then it went (squeaky noise) because it was on the side. But that's okay. 20 is what it ended up as. Oh no! Oh, Grog, how's your back? Oh, Trinket, give him a massage. He's really good at it! Can I look down the passageway that was opened up? Is it dangerous at all? 18. Tiberius, can you send a little light down that passageway? Let's do it. Oh no, what did we just let loose? I'm staying outside with Trinket and Grog. Armor. Look for armor! Ooh! Oh! Didn't he say to bring back some stuff from the Underdark? Oh wait, your magic guy said to bring back some magic stuff from the Underdark. What is it? What does it do? I don't think so. Who has low AC that could use it? Oh that's why it's still-- Oh no! One. Everything okay in there? You're cursed? I bet Pike has that spell. I don't know? Nothing? It was that golden armor, yeah. Oh no. You're not in the room. (whispers) Damn it. I was trying to get it. Ooh! Hey, did you get that armor back? Hey, can I have that armor? Can I have it? Please? No, she gave it back. No, she gave it back. Give it, give it. Please, can I have that armor? "Thanks." I go put it on. I don't know what it is. It's magic though. Yeah. Too late. Let's just keep moving, all right? Let's just keep moving. No, we should just-- Ow ow! Come on. I need it. Roll. Shit. (yelling) Aha! It's mine, it's mine! Sure it was. Yeah, what does it do? All right, I'll just add a bunch of stuff to my stuff. Oh, natural 20! What? There's a sunken boat in the lake. Down here? Clarota, why? Why boats? Who's a good swimmer? You guys want to take a look? Good times. Maybe you come back. Are you still in the water? Yay. Awesome. Awesome. Clarota, is that mushroom forest, I mean, is that your home? We should not take the bridge. I like it. You want me to go down there? All right. Let's do it. Maybe we should check out the boats first. Yeah. His air bottle. Can you fit that boat in your Wheel of Mending? Tiberius, welcome to the surface. Can you use your Wheel of Mending on that boat that you just pulled up? Try the wheel first. Will it fit all of us, you think? I get on the magic carpet. Trinket, get in the boat. There's three small caves. Well, two small caves and then a path. Toward the island, I think. Cave first? And then island. Let's go there. That might be cliffs on the back end, though, you guys. We won't be able to scale those. Set sail. Towards the island! We're going, we're sailing. I'm on the carpet with you. Should we put Pass Without a Trace on us? Oh, okay. So it's pretty big, then. Okay. Should we land on the beach and then check out that little cave? All right. As we're flying overhead, can I get a better look at if there's anything on the beach? What about the little island-- the little cave. Yeah. Treasure! Pirates! Arr! Do we fly in, Tiberius? And just go... All right. Stealth and fly in. Can we do that? Is that possible? To stealth and fly at the same time? 13. This looks a little dangerous. Be ready to run. Oh god. We're on the carpet. Percy, undead! Oh no! We're pirates! (growls) Help us, Ashley! Enough with the dick jokes. We did? Yeah. They were texting all of us the pictures. Grog! Yeah, you're going to be Grog, you've got to be bald. And then get a cyborg brain, because that's what he has. He's a beast. Travis has been looking online. He wants his own axe. No, we're not doing that tonight. Okay, 1000 shirts sold. Matt will do a sexy dance if we sell 1,000 shirts. Oh man, you've got to hurry to get to the airport. Okay. Thank you for all your support. Did you erase the Overlord drawing? That's amazing.
