The joy of sitting next to you. You know, the kind of superstitious gamer that thinks that the color and style of dice actually makes any difference at all. The sort of weirdo who believes some dice are lucky and some are cursed. Or one of those crackpot shut-ins who uses dice jails-- ha ha ha. Those people are lame. Anyway, check them out at w-w-w-dot-- dndbeyond.com That's D-N-D not D-and-D. DnD. Get $10 off any book in the marketplace with code 'beginnings.' Also, Sam Riegel is a cock bag. Look, I gave him a dice and he gave me a dice. I expected your cheeks to be all poofy. You look chiseled. Whoa, that was fast! I didn't even sort my dice yet! That was the third spell, by the way. Detect Good and Evil. No spells. I've got cantrips though, so don't worry, guys. Just the fried piece. Not even an onion left in there. Oh! Yours rolled a one, too. (laughter) Oh no, oh no! You have three initiative? What's your initiative? No, I'm four. One plus three. Yeah, they're just sitting there. They are fast moving zombies! We should probably kill the zombies because anybody that gets bitten by a zombie turns into another zombie! Now I just want to do Hamilton with all our character voices. Oh, you're out there all by yourself! Beau! I don't know what's happening! What's new at the table? This is so cute. Look at all the little barrels. Fifteen plus whatever. Make up for our shortcomings, Taliesin! You cut like a little v cake with head. Oh, that's what rouges can do, they can use their bonus action to dash? Oh okay! I'm going to sit down on the ground and open the tent. And look out. Then I say Oh shit, I shouldn't have used all those spells earlier. All I have is Sacred Flame, and I'm going to do that. I'm going to shoot Sacred Flame and at the same time I'm going to go Frumpkin, come here, let me pet you! Yeah, it's a 13 dexterity. That doesn't do any damage then? It just says that's it. Balls! (Coughs) Shit. Frumpkin! Lumpy, come here. Sorry, guys. Is that a cantrip? Renewed undead strength? TRAVIS and No, don't leave me! Two more swings? Two more flourishes. Renewed, undead strength. Kill it, Nott! With sneak attack you double your dice. I come running out of the tent. Say Molly! Oh shit, oh no! Okay. I kneel down next to him and I'll do Spare the Dying cantrip. Yes. It took someone going unconscious, guys. Can I try and do some medicine on him? Does that heal him at all? I don't think so. I have doughnuts, some paint supplies. I'm the cleric? What is this? I've never traveled with a bunch of people that I thought would die in front of me, okay? I never needed a healer's kit before. (gasps) You have a healer's kit? Oh my gosh. I've always wanted one of these for so long. Yes! How do I use this, though? I open it and rummage through a bunch of shit here. Should I? What if I roll a one on it? A nine? Yeah, is any of their armor still usable? Because we can pretend we're guards for some reason. Oh. We should get out of here soon though because guards could be coming. It jumped off that way. Yeah. There's probably more coming, I would think. I don't know who should run where. I have his head in my lap and I'm slapping his cheek consistently. Ooh! Ooh good, we can put Molly on the back of the wagon. That way we can get him out of here. And the guards' bodies, too! That way we can drop them off away from the carnival and people won't think it's related. I'm a very wise person. Okay. I'll do it. I go pick him up and carry him. Somebody needs to grab Molly. He's still over there. The one with the two horses attached, yo. Can you see it? We'll take that one. Unhook the other horse so we can steal that one, too. They're outies. Oh my god. Don't worry, Caleb, I'm okay. He's alive! You're awake! How do you feel? I saved your life. You should be really grateful. Are you sure? What are you going to say to them? Don't say that we were here. Don't mention we were here. That's pretty important, I think. Yeah? We'll get them out of it. What happened to her? Did it take Toya with it? We need to find evidence to exonerate us. Let's go. Are we really chasing the toad right now? Molly obviously did the most damage out of anyone and he's almost dead right now. We are going to rest, right? We can't just chase after a toad. We'll die. Fjord, I'm trusting you. Okay. Yeah, it's cute. Yeah, let's follow the direction that the toad went. I like it. It's a good plan. This is definitely not going to backfire. Let's go. (laughter) When we get far away from the carnival, we should drop the guard bodies off. Push them out so it looks like they were on patrol when they turned into zombies. Far away from the carnival. Exactly! Like a lake patrol. Take them out of this wagon! Or a giant toad sitting in the water? Can they see us? If we can't see them very clearly, they can't see us very clearly. We don't have a light on us. Go up a little further away from the boat and then dump the bodies. It's not like we're trying to hide the bodies. We're saying they turned into zombies around here. Is that stupid? Oh, coming from the carnival. That would definitely work. Will you add my name to that list? Like normal. Maybe we dump the bodies and I'll get out and try to make the tracks go away for a little bit. I'll walk up the path and do like this. Yeah, but the wagon will come from the carnival straight to the bodies. Isn't that weird? Not that far. I think we have to go back to the inn, right? Yeah. Oh, okay. Well... All right. Are we dumping these bodies or what? Yeah. I get out and I start positioning them like maybe they were having a romantic tryst. Do you want us to? Sure, let's do that. Oh, she's all about shady shit. She does a lot of it. (singsong) Go to sleep, little tiefling. They're late night fishermen. Can I look for toad tracks? I didn't. That was a whole lot of rolls. Survival. 11. Fjord! Come look at this! This is definitely toad tracks. That lump is the toad. So we head towards that boat that hit land. If we go towards the toad we are going to fight the toad. Because you used your blood on it? I bet you have a thing where you can click it on. That's what we figured. Straight across. It could have gone to the island. Will you be able to keep tracking it? After you sleep? He was a fiend. Yeah, yeah, yeah! It's open 24 hours. Yeah. You should do that. Let's go. I don't think we would have taken the cart past the fishermen. Are we going to do that? I don't think we would have gone right past the fishermen that would be able to identify us. The horse whimpers; you hurt a horse. You rolled shit, too! I use Thaumaturgy and I make the sound of like a predator behind them. Okay, 13! Those ducks are scary! We're being careful. I'm going to-- Does anybody have shitty stealth? Well okay, I was going to give anybody advantage, but here you go. Wow, that was bad. 18. We should go to sleep. Do we reset our max hit points when we take a long rest? I fell asleep in my sketchbook, halfway through my drawing of the two zombie guards making out. They're zombies, so yeah! One arm is like off to the side. Is that our door? Hold on, I'm naked! I'll get it! No, I get up, I get it. Hello! Did you come back to play some games? Well, you know, we might want to brush our teeth. No. Now we have time to-- Okay. I'll see you soon! I miss you already! It's two o'clock in the afternoon, you said? When we woke up?! I know, it's confusing when you speak with the accent all the time! Cool. Why are you guys so happy? Can I look at one of your books? Is that a yes? You said yes. I'm not afraid of dicks. Can I look over his shoulder the whole time he's reading it? Yeah. In a couple hours. That's right, we were in this inn the whole time. We can definitely steal a boat. He was a sailor! That's how I met him! As soon as Caleb looks up, I look in his book. What is your book about? (gasps) Those are my favorite! Are there drawings of them? He laughed at it the first 20 times I said it to him. What does it say? That is what they look like. They look like husks! You never noticed him eating people before? Okay. (gasps) That's what was happening to Toya. Maybe all of you. Does it say anything about it hiding in water? Does it say anything about it liking the sound of song? Is it related at all to the periwinkles you were talking about before? Does it say how to kill it? Well, most fiends are weak to holy damage, right? 14. "Reading." What's going on? But we could help. Obviously, we had nothing to do with it if people are hurt outside and we were here the whole time. How much did you say it costs, though? Octopuses are very smart. I didn't say I was very smart. Get ten gold worth of incense? You're going through gold very quickly. I could help you. Okay, I'll put one in, then you have only eight. Damn it. Right here? This is the lumpiest little bird I've ever seen. I feel so special and blessed, you guys. Thank you. Do we have to get in disguise again in order to leave? He can't communicate with us when he's like this? Can he feel if we touch him? I poke him in the forehead. Oh, okay. Can he tell who did it? That's wonderful. Well, okay, but he won't know now. I'm going to braid Caleb's hair. I know. Like a few little braids, because his hair is not super long. Maybe one here, one here, and one down here. (gasps) Now we can spy on the people below us. Iron? That's not noticeable. Oh man, I've been concentrating on skinky-doodles all day. Man. All right. It's fine. MARISHA and No, you keep it. I'm a very generous person. Did you have it fly down closer so you could see better? I guess we should go to the big island? Should we wait until dusky-time? Okay. Does anybody else want braids in the amount of time we have to wait? Of course, I can totally do that. I don't want to waste a spell this time. That's awesome! They came separate. I thought when we talked to them they said that Toya came after Kylre. They joined the circus at separate times. We gave them a hard-- what was it? Yeah, Good Cop. I was the good cop. Yeah, and we got hard information from them! Yeah, and I was like, "Don't worry, she won't hurt you!" Then they fessed up to everything! They were like, "We're a fiend!" and she was like, "I'm a little girl!" That was how it went. Can they all tell fortunes like you? No, they didn't lie to us! They told us the truth! What if he's like one of those creatures that lives on the bottom of the sea, and she's not actually even a person, she's like this light thing that dangles in front of-- Yeah! I bless you. Maybe you should go out the front and talk to him and distract him so we can sneak out the window. I'm so scared of rolling right now. Oh, no. No! 21. Don't make comments after he just was kind to us. I have my hood up. You should talk to people. That was pretty cool, Gramps. Yes, you can definitely trust me. Can I pull Fjord aside while she's off doing that? Fjord, that voice you're doing. It almost sounded like you actually did in Port Damali. I mean, I like that voice. I like this voice too, though. I like it. You can keep doing it. Wait, are you still in bird mode? What's Crookedstone? Oh, so the big one is Crookedstone? I mean, that sounds like fun, right? Tell me more about this witch! Did she have a wart on her nose? Yeah. Did she wear a hat? Like a pointy one? Right? I'm going to draw witches in my sketchbook. So it went well? I choked on my spit as I wooed. How tall was the lizard man? Devil toad? Okay. We are going to have a picnic on the island. Nighttime beach party! Wait, what is it, a deception? 14. Here, I'll help you, Gramps. On either side. Should I cast Good and Evil Detection again? I can do it. What was the name of the creature again? He blew it out. I can cast it, I just will lose a spell slot. Roll really good. It's a big island. Okay. Nott should be next to Caleb, because he can't see. So Nott should be right next to Caleb. Okay. So we spread. Do we smell any brimstone? 17. The veils are covered in flour. (laughter) Stop burping! Yes you did! You probably just breathed out hard. Can we sneak around the hut? Can we sneak around the ruin? I have darkvision. No, we're pointing at you. I'll do it! Because I like witch huts, I'll do it. What's yours? All of us? (cheering) And little Toya. Me and Molly were closer to it. Closer than Caleb. Yeah, that's good. Yes, I'm good. Oh no, they rolled really well. Toya's there too. She's going to pull out some shit. 16. Oh no. (singing) We're fucked. We're fucked. Nine. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity. So she can appear anywhere? Tight. Okay, she's going to appear in the tree in front of me. Next to Fjord. No, Matt did the second one! Isn't that cool!? Then as me, I'm going to run away. Can I run behind a tree and crouch? I'm going to crouch behind it. That's my turn. I feel like Beau will have far less problems hurting children. She's got the strongest windpipe ever. Don't you add something? So smart. Imps are the top of the round? Jeez louise. No-o-o-o! (counting) 30, he can land right there. Oh god. 21. Am I within hitting range-- me-me-me-- Can I run away without getting hit? Okay. Do you want to do something first? Okay. I'm going to, with my duplicity self, get up on the roof. Right there. She's going to Guiding Bolt straight in his face. Yes. Balls! Seven. Skinky-doodie! I am going to say you are so stupid, why did you get up on the roof like that?! That's why he saw you! I am going to run to the tree, straight back. It doesn't hit me. 17. I got a shield, bitches. That was Fjord's other job. Punch her in the face! Oh, he is going to be so pissed! What are the odds you think that Yasha's on this island and she's going to come save us all? Do something cool. You knocked me off the roof. She didn't feel anything. She doesn't have actual nerves. Oh no! God (angry muttering)-- seven. So 12 total? And I've got a thing right in front of me so I can't-- You can go first this time. Okay. I'm going to cast-- fuck-- Cure Wounds on myself. Yeah. Oh, that's good! Nine points of damage healed. Okay. Which is going to go away as soon as I turn and run away from the imp towards Fjord, around the trees so that the frog guy doesn't get an attack on me. I guess, yeah. I'm just running away saying Shit, shit, shit! I guess so. Are you still alive? Wouldn't that be funny if we killed the thing and then died from the imps? That would be so funny. I'm going to turn and say Oh, help me, Traveler! I'm going to cast Word of Radiance. Which will hit both of the imps with 1d6 radiant damage. It's Word of Radiance. Each creature of my choice I can see must succeed on a constitution saving throw. Of 13. 1d6 radiant. Six damage! Yeah. Yeah, that's the one he cursed. That was an action. As a bonus can I-- I don't even have a healing potion. I'm going to run over to-- oh shit, the imp is still over top of Fjord. I'm going to make my illusion jump down and start charging at the imp over Fjord. Oh no. It doesn't say! It just says for the duration you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space. I have advantage on attack rolls against the creature if we're both within five feet of each other. Both of them fucked you again. Poor Molly. His arms are getting so tired swinging both those blades. Do you want to attack the imp? Okay, then I'm going to run over to Fjord and cast Cure Wounds on him so he wakes up. With five hit points. Oh man, I start dancing around in a circle with my illusion. We did it, guys! Oh yeah. I want to go over and start searching his body. Investigation or perception? 14. Okay. What? This is awesome. Here, Fjord, I found a cloister of seamen for you. It's a bag of stuff that I think you will like. I already removed all the fancy stuff from it though. Whoa! I put all of the jewels on my fingers. Nott, look at me. Aren't these pretty rocks? On the bag. Yes, but first, can I use a ritual spell? Does that work against-- Yeah. I can do ritual spells? Can I Detect Magic on it? Hmm, they're just plain rings, but they're very pretty. We should bring her to the-- So that she can defend us. So that she can tell everyone that the fiend was bad. You are a very powerful wizard. Can I use my healing kit and help heal him? Does that work, or does it just bring somebody back to consciousness? Oh really? Okay, cool. I got nothing. I can heal you in the morning. We can rest for 30 minutes or an hour or so. I would just like to say that as we're resting there, I'm closing my eyes and keeping a hand down close to Nott with my rings on my fingers. It was all the mucus on the ring. I'm so proud of you. Good job, Fjord!
