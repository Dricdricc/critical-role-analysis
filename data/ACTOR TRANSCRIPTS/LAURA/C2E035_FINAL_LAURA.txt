Oh no. It's really lame. I'm sorry. No, just keep talking. I still have my purse on! Yeah! We got some things back in stock, y'all. No, I'm not, stop it. I did! We got the Wildemount dice back in stock! The pretty blue ones that we have and then we got limited amount of The Mighty Nein pins back in stock. Check that out right now; they're awesome. We have the maps back in stock, and I have heard the t-shirts are being restocked very shortly. That means check it out this weekend, like Friday or Monday. They should be back in there so check it out. Just refresh, and if you want them, they should be there. Woo! I stand next to Caleb and poke his biceps. Ooh! Do you want me to stabilize him? I can do that. What was the palace, what did he say? Where was the palace, is it in the ocean? Was it in the ocean? I have a question. Are we going to kill him? Well, if we don't, how do we get away without anyone knowing that we killed his guards and we let the guy go? What if he goes in to like a protection service or something? That's true. I mean, we weren't even going to attack if he hadn't attacked us in the first place. I don't want him to get revenge on my mother. Can we make it seem like Algar was the one who did all this? Like maybe he turned-- No? Well, because I heard Tracy say that she was staying at the fancy-- the Lavish Chateau. Oh, good call. What if we send him out to sea? Don't necessarily kill him, but make him leave and then make it seem like he was the one that did everything. Worst case scenario, we kill him. Oh, okay, yes. I will disguise myself as a tortle, but not the that guy we met, like a tortle that's a girl. No, no hair, but, like, a skirt. Because girls wear skirts, obviously, that's what girls do. You could do a Prayer of Healing. Oh really? We could both do Prayers of Healing. I'm going to say I'm doing it, too, but I'm not really going to. Dear Traveler, please heal everyone. Do you guys feel better? You're welcome. Does he have any pretty buttons? That's good hobbies. Woo, Ruby! She's real hot. (laughter) Oh man, you're going to be in so much trouble. What do we do with him so nobody sees him? Hey, Yasha, what's in your bag you've been carrying? Okay. I mean, (southern accent) Oh, all right. (whispering) Shit, I forgot to do the voice. How do you remember to do that all the time? I'm going to pull out my disguise kit and give him a nice little beard and a mustache. And an eye patch. I'm proficient with disguise, so I roll with advantage, because I'm--? Plus proficiency, 20. His partner in Port Damali, Fjord. I bet it's his partner in Port Damali. See? The accent, it makes me smarter. I draw a dick on it. Wait, wait, wait. Is this your office? These people will know this is your office? Got it. Thank you. (southern accent) I mean, got it, thank you. Jorge. Sorry. Are any of these-- (southern accent) Are any of these letters written by you? I'm going to take one and study it. Hey, I'm left-handed. Walk him out and make sure that he gets on the boat? Well, I got to write some shit in this office, but it's up to y'all. Don't tell him all those things. I totally plan on doing that shit. Get out of here before talking about-- (teeth clenched) Get out! Yeah, we'll see you back at the (mumble). Somewhere in Tal'Dorei. Want to give him a little spending cash? Make sure he's not completely destitute when he gets there. He was a bad person. We didn't kill him. I need to write a letter about-- okay, what should I say? "I hate this city, I want everyone "to suffer what I feel in my heart?" "I'm sick of all you people pushing me around, I'm freeing this djinn and I'm setting sail for another land." How about all of that? That's probably good. Okay, well. What if I just write "Ha ha ha, I'm so glad you guys are going to suffer, I got "away scot free." If the djinn got away, then maybe the djinn did it. Unless you're high enough level, and then it (pop). So I'm writing this letter? And I'm leaving it in his office, yeah? What? Do we have two Channel Divinities or just one at this level? Then I Turn Undead! Oh, that's true. What do you guys think? Okay. Deuce has a really good idea. Maybe instead of we say, "Go fuck yourself," and all of that, what if we say-- It's really strong, we have this version of his letter right here. Draft number two. "Oh no, I lost control of the genie, and now I am so scared I'm running away." Ah! I can't do anything! I try to attack it. I'll Sacred Flame him. Oh! That's 11. 11 radiant damage. Oh, it's not? I like it better when he's saying, "Fuck yourself." I think we should stick with the go-fuck-yourself version and say "I intentionally--" he intentionally let him go, and he knew that he was going to fuck over the city and run. Okay. Sincerely-- I'm leaving it in the office, Fjord. Choke upon your woe! Or eat fecal matter, question mark? Signed Algar. (laughter) With proficiency. Oh yeah! I do, I do! I focus. Depending on how I roll, I can roll again? Ooh! That's dexterity plus proficiency? Really? No, I didn't roll twice. Okay. Oh, I'm going to spend it, just in case. Proficiency bonus is just your initiative? Where's your proficiency? So 22. Thank you, thank you. All right, I'm leaving this on his desk. Ooh! No. I'll just maybe tape it. With a quill! It's pretty threatening, it's a feather. Should we go down and escape the other way so nobody sees-- Oh, I guess you guys already left. We forged it! That's true. Is he there every midnight or just tonight midnight? Because if we wait until tomorrow, I can Zone of Truth him. Yeah, let's go tell Mama what we did! Can I look around and see if the city seems like it's being affected at all by the no power? (whispering) Natural 20. I think it's fine. Oh God, oh God, oh God. I also used another Disguise Self spell to make sure I stay-- Tortley. Yeah, probably should tell her. Just go upstairs. Okay, I go upstairs. Bluude! Doesn't he know that I am Jester, still? Bluude, it's me! My tortle eyebrows are going like this. His name is Bluude. We're here to see Mama. Hi! Do you have company? Can we come in and talk to you for just a second? I'll drop the disguise spell once we're inside. (whispering) This is Yasha. So, you know that guy? The guy that was bugging you. We went to go talk to him, but he had already left. Yes, he had fled the city, apparently. Things happened, they were real bad or something, I don't know. Of course! Yeah, we were going to talk to him and everything, but he is gone, so... Of course. Do you guys want to eat anything? (sounds of agreement) Is my mom still in this room? Look, here's the thing-- Look, I don't want her getting in trouble for anything that happened. I don't know! The less she knows, the better! What if she found out something and she judged me for it because we did something bad? She won't. Why would she find out? Well, I usually don't. It's just to protect her. It is a white lie. Oh no, is it bad? What did I do? Was it bad? I'm happy to be home for a bit. Oh, well, I don't know. We're here for Fjord, really, so it's up to him. Weren't you trying to find out about the guys? Fjord swallowed a ball, and it's inside of him now, and he doesn't know what's going on, so-- Mama, it's not that kind of ball he swallowed. Yeah, I guess so. Very sweet, see? I am very sweet. I didn't get to come down here very much and eat with you. It's nice to be able to be here now. Shit. I'm not disguised, fuck. I need to remember to do this more. (dice hit the table) Oh no. I have that other mask that I bought. Remember the metal mask, that I bought when I was with you? I'm going to put it on. You can climb up. Yeah, you're a monk, you can climb up to the ceiling. Hey, Mama? Will you watch my puppy? Well, it's me and Beau's puppy, really. Will you watch our puppy while we go out tonight? Oh, really? Are you good with puppies? Because this one's kind of special. Nugget. Poof! Oh, thank you. Nugget, it's me. Poof! He blinks. Aww. I'm going to tell Nugget to look at my Mama and say, blink to her right now, okay, for as long as we tell you to. That's home. Mama, tell him you're home. No, tell him you are home. You are his home. That's good, here. Be careful, he pees on things. I didn't get rid of him. He's still our dog. Maybe. No, the weasel's staying with me. I know, it's such a temptation. See? He responds when you talk sternly. I put my hood up. I take the mask off, but I put my hood up. What do you see? Is he blond? Is he a blond half-elf? There's a guy darting. Ooh. Wait, do you want-- Blessing of the Trickster! It gives you advantage on stealth checks! Ooh. I wonder what he's waiting for. That's true. That's what we did. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do the figures look like? I want to look. Yeah, right. I can't tell. (phone beeping) I got a 14. I can't really tell. I use Thaumaturgy to make a dolphin sound. (dolphin chittering) Aww, seven. I like that your ring made a (loud splashing). Run away, Tracy. Do you get ki points on short rests? Oh my god, it's so cool. I hope they don't kill Marius. Yeah, right? So good! Yeah, hiding next to a building or something. Crouching down, observing, right? Can you talk to him before you Thunder Step back? Where's the save point? Who am I after in the initiative? Okay. I think we should get the fuck out. Oh, you already get advantage? What a stupid... Okay. Am I within 60 feet of this guy? Okay, I'm going to step forward a little bit. There, there... sure. Okay I'm going to cast Hold Person at third level on both him and him. MATT and Okay, well, he's paralyzed. I'm going to back up and try to get around that building if I can. No, around the back of it. We could've found out if we wouldn't have been stupid. Doesn't everybody get advantage on attacks against her, too? That would suck with the arrows. Oh, really? Hypnotic Pattern? What is that? Just try to get Marius out, right? Is it advantage because he's incapacitated? Well, I was just thinking we could-- What's his name? What's the guy-- Orly? Say Orly sent us and try to get out. Shake him out. Do you get advantage because he's incapacitated? It's different. She's a harsh girl. Okay, you're right. Are you hurting? I guess-- this is really hard. I don't have anything that's going to help get him out that I can think of. Okay, I'm going to cast-- fuck. I'll move forward-- well, yeah, to be closer to Beau, and I'm going to cast-- fuck it-- Sanctuary. Yeah. Yeah, Sanctuary on Beau, so anybody that makes an attack against her has to either-- whatever, you know the spell. Then I'm going to-- sorry, that's a bonus action. I'm freaking out! I don't know what to do! Then I'm going to cast Sacred Flame at-- can I see anybody on the boat? I guess I'm going to try to hit him. 60 feet. A dex. Woo! Six points of damage. Yeah, Hold Person, that was a good one. Then I'm going to use the rest of my movement to go back to where I was. Cool. Is there any way to see what the name of that ship is? Is it on the side of the ship at all? No, they said, "Burn it all." Seriously? They had a dagger to your throat, you dick. (inaudible) (whispering) Because I'm not up there, and no one else is remembering. "The Captain" is what we're supposed to say. Are you still up? Do we see the sail? Does it have any markings on it? What? You don't know how many people are on that boat! Oh my god. Are we trying to get back on the boat now? Okay, I guess I'm going to-- fucking, like an asshole, run towards the boat. God, this is so dumb. I run towards the boat, but I'm going to-- as far as I can. How hurt are you? Okay, I'll double dash to get to the fucking boat. Oh my lord. He can do it again. He went so fast he knocked me into the boat. Does anyone know how to fucking drive a boat? Oh my god, the zolezzo are going to come. You can do ominous whispers. It's listed. We can't get the boat out of here fast enough before they can catch the boat. Bloop! This is the stupidest thing. The dumbest-- Save yourself! Run away! Okay. I'm going to-- I'm going to crouch down, and I'm going to cast Invoke Duplicity. Next to me, where I crouched down from. I'm going to have her pop up and run across the gangplank. (whispers) That's good. I'm crouched down. Yeah, because I'm crouched. Where's Keyleth when you need her? He's going to jump in the water. Why did you roll? Why didn't you roll?! Seriously? I don't even know that's happening. SAM and Great. I'm going to use my Duplicate to run forward... I'm going to use my Pearl of Power to cast my last remaining 3rd-level spell, and I'm going to cast Charm Person on the three of the guards that I can see. Yeah, sure. Okay, yeah, that's good. For an hour. It is charmed by you until the spell ends or until your companions do anything harmful to it. When the spell ends-- It doesn't say anything about it not being in combat. Oh, okay. It doesn't say that on the thingy. Sorry. 15! Okay. I guess I'm going to stay hidden on my end and try to make my way down. I can't do anything below, but okay, whatever, yeah. Yeah, I guess I'm going to try to go-- No, because I'm going to keep visual on Duplicate Jester. I'm going to stay hidden on the top. Don't hit those guys in the front. The guy that targeted Beau has to make a wisdom saving throw. No, he just fails if on a fail-- It just looks like me, though. Can you lower yourself? You're pretty tall. TALIESIN; Can I climb down instead of jumping? Can she help try to get the ship to move more? Don't do it, you only have one hit point. No, you don't. Fjord. Don't do that. Oh god, are we going to sink? I'm going to pull out my axe, the duplicate, and I'm going to act like she hits herself with it-- so stupid-- and go (dying noise) and falls into the water. She's going to be floating in the water, and then I'm going to go-- Then I'm going to, for my action as Jester, go and try to hold the door shut for the under-- But I'm crawling, I don't want them to see me. Are you downstairs? I thought you were upstairs. Also, there's a girl floating in the water. Yeah! I'm going to let Caleb out from below. I'm assuming I could have heard Caleb going-- Well, if I look around-- Where's Caleb?! I open the door! Caleb! Oh, Caleb. I use Hellish Rebuke. No. Okay, yes. I use Hellish Rebuke. Okay. He takes 21 points of damage back. Yes. Yeah, it's only a 12 dex save. Yeah, it's a racial ability. What did I say? 21? Half of that, 11. Whose turn is it to get him up? Fjord needs healing. Prayer? I go to the back of the boat to see the name of the boat. Okay. Can I hit back? Because I-- Okay, then... yeah. I'm going to-- I get two attacks, don't I? No, I just get one attack. I'm not going to. Instead of killing him, I'm going to say, you probably don't want to attack me. We've got a boat full of people. We just took your ship. You should put down your weapon. Yeah. Intimidation, 13. What? They're right here. Look behind me, you stupid. Okay. Okay. Okay. No, it's straight. Because you cast... Honestly, I think we did a pretty good job after everything. We got a ship! I'm going like "Ow, ow, ow!" He just ran back down. Okay, yeah. No, it has to be my handaxe. Yeah, that definitely hits, 25. Ten points of damage. I think I'm going to use my cantrip Spare the Dying and make sure he doesn't die die. Does he die die? I didn't want to kill him. Like that wasn't my goal, but I didn't say that out loud. Sorry, it really wasn't my intention to do that. I was aiming for his shoulder, and I missed and hit his head. (sing-song) You can never go back! Widow's Embrace? The Mist. (gasp) Do you happen to know where those business contacts came from, these people? Do you know? The guy we just killed? There's also maps downstairs. I don't know that, he knows that, never mind. What's the name of her ship? She's a pirate! Ooh! That's the money he was going to return. That's what he got paid. We're probably not going to kill you. You'll find out soon enough. I mean we already said. Ionos. Take the thing off. We didn't know that already. We didn't know she was the captain. We didn't know what her ship was about. Let's go downstairs. Maybe we can find something useful. I'll follow him. I think it was fun! Honestly, I think it was terrible but it was cool. Think about when we got our flying carpet. Like, we didn't mean to get the flying carpet. We ended up bringing the entire tower down upon ourselves, right? Who knows! Yay! Well think about, nobody that saw us in the city, saw us taking the boat lived to tell the tale. Just kidding, all of the guards right there did.
