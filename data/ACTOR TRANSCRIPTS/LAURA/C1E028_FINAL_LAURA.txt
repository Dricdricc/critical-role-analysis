What?! Yeah, it is. Whoa. Whoa, it is? We love you so much! Aw. You did? (all cheer) That's so great! That's super exciting. Oh yeah. I definitely hit somebody in the face with one of those rolls. I'm so sorry. Yes, I am an archer. I Hunter's Marked your face. I don't know! Yeah. Yeah, we thought it was gonna be like 40 people. That-- pretty great. Was great. Pretty great. Speaking of Telltale, the final episode of Tales from the Borderlands comes out next week. Episode five, what! Exciting. We have a gnome. Let's do it! Yeah, right? That would have been smart. I know. So dumb. That we didn't research that creature. I know, it's growing! So you can shave-- How far are we from 10K? All right. Oh no! Yeah, add your points right now. 1d12! Hey, that's good! Plus-- Whoa! 16 extra health points! He rolled an 11 plus five! Don't complicate things. 19. He is definitely-- (whispers) Vengeance! (whispers) Vengeance! Stop touching me. Stop touching me. Argh. (gasps) We're in a freaking-- Is it a valley, or is it like those are cliff sides and we could fall? Okay. Okay. Got it. Electrified. Don't think about it, just go. Don't calculate it, Matt. It's fine. Fuck. With advantage because I'm in the mountains? 21. Argh. (growls) Eight. Yay. He got a eight. (gasps) Trinket's fucking dead, yo. That fast?! He's unconscious. Does Trinket have to make saving throws? Ooh, ooh, wait. He's only got 42 hit points. Vengeance! Vengeance. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. And then I'm going to-- Why is he closer now? Sorry, Grog. I'm going to Hail of Thorns him. Yeah, well-- 30. No, wait, that's wrong. No, 30. (sighs) I'm so angry right now! Thorn's d-- Ten. (sighs) 3d10. 18 plus two is 20. What is that? 22. No, that's the attack. Oh, yeah. Oh shit, I'm sorry. The other one was 27. Awoo. Ten plus-- Plus 15. Yes. Oh wait, no, I wasn't adding the seven. Wait no, that's a lie. That's a 15, 16, 17, plus five. 21. Can I pull him? Can I pull him out of the way? Just pull him into the little crevice, for my move. For my move. Is that a move action, or would it be an action-action? Ugh. Oh no. I get out of the line. Towards the little crevice. Yeah. But I still want to be near Trinket. I'm so sorry. I think I missed a box. (laughs) (whimpers) Oh no. Why would you do that? He rolled a 19. Don't say that. Thank you, Keyleth. 2d8 plus ten? That's great. (all laugh) 25! That's great! He licks her. (gasps) Oh my god. (gasps) Is that permanent? Yeah! Ooh, oh no. Ow. No, he's okay. We want to hurt him! Do what you do. Clenched Fisht. Oh no. Good try, Scanlan. That's awesome. Oh no. Oh no. (as Vax) Half damage. (as Vax) Half damage. Okay, okay. Don't say that's nothing. Don't say that's nothing. (gasps) What? Okay. How does the Hide thing work? Do I hide at the beginning of the turn or at the end of the turn? Okay. I'm going to move out. Can I still arrow it from where I am? Does it cancel out because I'm in the mountains? Damn it. I'm going to try to back up. Oh no. Wait, I can't see. I forgot my glasses. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'll try to back up towards, who is that? Percy? I'll try to back towards Percy. Sure, yeah. Why not? Well, Trinket's healed, and he's going to come with me. Although he's angry about it, because he wants to fight, but I just won't let him right now. Aw, Jesus. Really? No, just me. Trinket was too far away. Oh. (laughs) Oh, yay! Ugh. Ugh, okay. I'm going to shoot him. Okay. That is 22. Okay. 14 for the first hit. Second one is through the blazing bow, at 22. Oh no, 14 was the damage to it. And then, (noises). (noises) Ugh. 16. Oh, and I hide. I'm hiding behind-- Percy. (groans) Oh. I hid in the wrong place. I went to the wrong place. It's okay. Next time I know. You can. Throw it over my way. I'll catch it. Ha ha! Also 22. Oh. TRAVIS and Just keep rolling. Plus your flaming claws. Don't forget your flaming claws. I know, it was really loud! Glaive? The thing that he killed the old lady with. Ooh, those are good! Yeah! Nice one! Nice! Into the eyeballs! (high-pitched) Pew, pew. Oh, no. No. Could you have added inspiration dice to that? Oh, no. Oh no. We're in a group. Smart move, Percy. Why are you abandoning me? It just burps out lightning. I know. He's thinking. I know. This is bad. Oh, God. Dodge it. Dodge it. Oh no! Oh, God. Can I, as a bonus action, give Trinket a healing potion? Okay, never mind. I am going to attack it. Okay. He's, oh, I missed. That's a 14. Great. Good times, good times. 16. Both miss. Fucking A. What a waste. This dice is out for the rest of the game. I'm gonna run. Is there an outcropping where we are? I can't see. I'm going to pull fully in on that side. I can't see. He's gonna rest. And he's going to keep protecting Scanlan, because-- Yeah, yeah. Eee, good. Grog? Maybe you unrage. Lullaby, Hulk. Lullaby. You killed it real good! I run, I walk up to it and kick it, and say, that's for Trinket. Dick. That'd be great. Do we need to hide? Do we need to climb up to its little cave that it was in, maybe? And hide. It had a cave. Didn't it come out of a cave, when we saw it? Oh, I thought it was a cave. Be here right now. Be present. Can I stealth and climb up and see if I can see a cavern? A little cave. Yeah! What do I add to that? Acrobatics? Athletics. Oh, really? That's not what it was; I moved it. Oh no, 12. I'm so weak, but I'm holding to see if I see a cave. (groans) 23. (groans) Oh god it hurts. You're almost as weak as I am, dude. Here we go. Athletics. I know, I don't think so. No, we were about to rest. Wow. Oh, really, you rolled worse than me. Like Skyrim trying to get-- Nice. We didn't even get up a little bit. Does my tracking tell me anything? 17. 17 on nature. Granite. Simple stone. (all laugh) What? Tiberius, you prepared a lot. No, no, we need that! We need that. We need that. Tiberius. He's actually got a lot of hit points, really. I understand that. Oh, no. We need you. Shit. Really, Tiberius, really? (groans) (groans) And then, you pull it-- -- out of someone's ear. Whoa! I keep a perception out to see anything. What do you think I'm doing? I'm scanning. I'm thinking. I'm wanting to see if I see any dragons. Do I see any dragons? Was the behir a dragony sort of thing? There's a dragony something. I don't know, Scanlan. There's dragony things, though. I didn't poo. I'm sensing with my mind. What are you reading? How did you even know that? Nothing. You're good, Grog. Maybe a steak, some salad. Shrimp cocktail. (gasps) You are seriously. What? That's disgusting. Really gross, both of you. Enough. Nothing that I can sense. There's nothing that we're going to run across. So we're not going to run into any dragons? Okay, we're fine. Yeah. (shocked noise) He rolled a natural 20. He's an expert on mountains. We should definitely stay away from that. Maybe hide and make sure we're hidey-hidey? I have Pass Without a Trace. And do we have invisibil--oh, no. You have-- Maybe we'll stealth it. No, I don't want to bring any attention. Like what? How'd that happen? How did that frickin' happen? You are magic. Can we see any kind of movement? It's really far away, or--? Is it movable? Right. Let's try to climb up the other side and then see what we can see. They like cold. Maybe get up at the top of it and then do this. Can we try to climb the other side? Yeah, I don't wanna be down on the bottom. I actually own climbing gear too, does that help? Okay. Do we add anything because of the climbing gear or is it? Ah, that's important. I give you my climbing gear because I already get advantage. How about that? Does that count? No. All right. Oh, so you don't need that. I got 15. Whoa. I feel-- (whispers) Should I say? How did Trinket get up the cavern? Can Trinket climb? They're good climbers? I'm sorry! But it felt wrong to lie. No. But we could tie the rope around Trinket's waist. With an athletics check? Does he get an advantage because of mountains? I'm just trying to be honest! Strength modifier? He got a 15, too. You got this buddy, you got this. Sorry. Yes. 19. No, no, no. If something could've taken out giant giants. What could it be that could've done that? (sings) There are big, tall, terrible giants in the sky. No, but she's a bird. Recon it. Yeah! Ooh, come on, Keyleth! Oh. Ooh. Ooh. Oh. Yeah, yeah, let's stealth. I don't know, I hope not. You should use the dust of tracelessness, Grog, just so our footsteps aren't seen. Stealth. (gasps) What is that?! What is it? What did you find? What is it? What is that? Ah, what is this? What is this? Can I tell what it is? Hey, look at this. I don't know. Keyleth, do you know anything about magic-y stuff? Tiberius bamfed out. What about you, Scanlan? Do you know anything about arcana? Okay. Thank you. Can we do that? I'm going to think about it real hard. I'm going to buy it a steak and I'm going to-- What is it, what is it? What is it? Should we get out? Should we leave? Just leave. Let's leave. Stealth it out? Stealthy out-ie? (groans) No, you're in the mountains! You don't get advantage? Aw, shit. Grog, Grog, inside. I cast Pass Without a Trace. Yeah? Do it! Do it, do it, Keyleth! Badass. But it knocks them all down. No, no, no! We should get the eff out of here. Now. Stealth and out. They know we're here now. They know we're here. That was a sentry. Oh yeah! Oh, we're looking at the city. I was pointing at you! What the what?! So Percy, do you know of any secret passages to get actually into the castle? I agree, can we camp out and hide? Because it's daytime. We should definitely attack during the day. What? Stealth? Up high. I like it. Could you turn yourself and fly? Ridiculous. Normal people. I like it. Everyone get your own tree? Trinket can climb trees! Bears climb trees! I'm casting Pass Without a Trace. How long does it last? Okay, fine! I guess I'll cast it tonight, never mind. Why are you being a dick, Scanlan? I'm not casting it yet. What are we rolling? 21 for me, and what do I-- just nothing. 19 for Trinket. And they're close to us now? So, I'll cast it on us now that they're closer. Maybe. So, should we add ten to all of our stealth rolls that had been, or do we have to roll again? Shit balls. You don't have to. Ten to whatever we roll. Not advantage. Mountains? Oh wait! That's another! That was worse than the first one, that's great. Okay, well, you didn't say you were doing it. 18. Oh, it's a chick! Oh no. (gasps) They're zombie giants?! Oh my god. Yeah, keeping an ear out for the wolves and just chilling in a tree. And also, I'm restringing my new, awesome bow. With the blazing bowstring. Which, by the way, is a longbow of sky sentinel. Once per long rest, I can use a Storm Arrow, which means that the next arrow I fire splits into three arrows. Roll an attack for each of them, they all get 1d6 extra for each one that hits. It's amazing! It's one time per long rest. Say what?! So, is it lightning damage or is it-- It says lightning damage. Thunder! Wait, our friends aren't back yet. It's already night and they're not back? Looking snazzy, Vax. It looks like you have a mullet. Keyleth, question. Can you make it look like we're not here with your foliage shit? You know, the illusions. Can we camp up in the tree? So nobody can come towards us. Ooh. I'm using Hide in Plain Sight to make me and Trinket extra, extra hidey. I have the unending rope, motherfucker. Sure, why not. That's where all the rope comes from that we ever use. Let's reinforce the spiderwebs. Oh, yeah. What's up? Don't you think they would know all the farmers around at this point? They've been there for a long time. Why is it called the Sun Tree? There's reasons. Maybe we need to battle them at the Sun Tree. Does it get a lot of sun? That could help us, because vampires hate the sun. Maybe that's why they're hanging bodies from it, to taint it. Would she be able to hear us? (gasps) Bring it back. I don't know. Bring up the god of the sun again, I don't know. Don't tell us what we can and can't do, Scanlan. I like it. Let's do it. I think they're terrified. And I don't want to let them know we're here, for fear they'll turn us in, in hopes of saving their own necks. This is true! It could help out. Let them know the god of the sun is on their side. Probably you and Scanlan are on that, I have a feeling. You killed Percy. And bring it back to life! Then we get the fuck out. No! Didn't you say that all around the Sun Tree nobody's there? Didn't you say nobody's around the Sun Tree? We'll fly up and over. You just did the same thing. Fly up and over, land, bring the tree back to life, get out. I feel like they know all the townspeople. When he was invisible! They probably saw you! No, you were invisible. How long? How long's a bit? I don't want to enrich all of the-- If we go right when the sun goes up-- We just sneak in. Here's the thing. I don't know if you want to get all the crops all fancy, because it'll just feed the Briarwoods. Maybe just do the tree area, which will be like two hours, maybe. A witch? Do you think that works? I like it. They would recognize you, wouldn't they, Percy? I like it. (gasps) Teacher. Teacher. Yeah. Remember that. That's awesome. You could fly overhead with Keyleth. Drop it like a bomb! I like it. I have a sweet potato right here, Scanlan. How far of a travel is it down into the city? So we can do that a little amount of time. So if we're going to try stealth this shit in-- So that we can be near the tree to protect you. Get into the town. Around the Sun Tree? Are we living in there?! We've got food for days. We've got food for days. He has a plan. We should stealth in. Yeah. We try to get in. We're going to cast Pass Without a Trace on everybody. Oh, natural 20 on stealth! Yeah. Plus, we have a bear. Oh no. There's still a bear. Could we cast illusion magic? Do we have it? Seeming! To make Grog and Trinket look like commoners. Yeah, do that! Yes. No, he'll just be a really drunk peasant. No! He'll look like a fucking donkey, or he'll look like another commoner. Then he'll look like a fucking commoner. He'll look like a commoner-- -- a weird commoner. I'm not leaving a fucking bear on the outside of town where there's hounds around, and there's fucking vampires and birds flying around, fuck you! There you go! All right. (laughs) So are you darling, so are you. (fake coughing) Where are we coming up? I have passive perception of 21; I'm always looking. Our farm burned down! No, no, no. Oh, we should avoid that shit! Let's go into the city! Keeping an eye out for, you know, buildings that look clustered and abandoned that we can hide in. Is there any other abandoned buildings around? Okay. Where's the castle? Is it on the top of the-- Oh, it's that thingy? Okay. (sings) Divine Intervention! If you, if you do your nature-y spell from inside a building, does it still do the same thing or do you have to be next to the tree while you're doing it? Okay. Let's keep moving. Okay. We avoid the tree a little bit and just keep going straight. Yeah? 19. No, that's a-- yeah, 19. (whispers) My god. Keep walking, keep your head down and keep walking. No, they have, like hideouts, they don't have to be where the soil they came from is. That was the first one. MATT and There wasn't a gnome cleric one there. It was a kid, yo. Yeah. Can I look out too, I've been on the lookout for a building the whole time! 30 feet?! Can we sneak in the windows, so it keeps chained? Yeah, Dust of tracelessness. Yeah. Then go talk to the tree, Keyleth. Is there a cellar here? Not yet, not just yet. Yeah. I think we can definitely use these for explosions, if we need them. Can you go invisible and still talk to the tree? Can you talk to the tree if you're invisible? Yeah. We're in the cellar, that's why I went to the cellar. But make it not obvious, because it doesn't want to look like we covered the windows. Do it! That's what she's going to do. From the cellar. I'm going with you to the tunnel. Yes. Do you want me to shoot the arrow for you? Can you talk to it from here, Keyleth? Yeah. (kid's voice) Gee wiz, I wish I had some water. Too bad we don't have Tiberius with us with his endless water fucking pitcher. Sure, sure, sure. You can bring it back! Try it. Reach up in its junk. I like it. It's $1000. Is that for each person, or 1000 gold for the whole party? How about you did three bowls? Are we eating in the cellar? No, no, for how long? An additional 2d12? Overall hit points. Ah, badass! Yay! Nice. We have another bowl. So the spell probably started around 11. Right, so we'll start the fight in the morning the next day. Man. That's mean, Matt. Thanks, guys. That's a lot! Lot of episodes. That's kind of awesome. Oh, you.
