Tonight is the last night. And then it's gone forever. Yes, you did. Every time I saw you were wearing it. Your parents are Critters? Yeah, that box is hers. Yeah. It's pretty remarkable. Yeah, otherwise, we'd all smell like Grog. Diss! Oh my gosh, it's so pretty! The panels behind us. I was just admiring-- I think we need to head back to Emon. We have all of the documents that you took from the Briarwoods' stuff. Plus, we have-- The new rulers, yeah. Well, we've got Percival. He's kind of in charge. Let's do that. That's right. They can't very well arrest Percival when he's royalty now. Well, now he's rich royalty. 50,000 gold? Flying carpet gold? Plus all of the documents that you found! Okay. Maybe we can wait until we get back to Emon and have Gilmore do it. Oh, we can't really ask Allura to do it. We stole the carpet from her in the first place. That would be a very bad move, I think. But then what? We wouldn't get it back. Maybe she was keeping it secret. Keeping it safe. Plus, we had them send word to Uriel, remember? We had them send a letter to Uriel, explaining all the wonderful things we did. Yes, I talked to him. So we're heading back to Emon. But we did send a letter ahead! And remember I said make sure to tell them how Vox Machina saved the day, and how wonderful we are, and you said, yes you would do that. I also think I probably sent a letter to Pike to let her know that we're safe and we survived everything, and that she would've been at Winter's Crest. They've got to, right? They have horses here. No. They don't have one. Yeah, walk us through an oak tree! We're left behind. Sealed, so it looks like we didn't tamper with it. Isn't Allura on her way here? Aren't a lot of people on their way here? I'm so confused. And Drez Vina, right? He's coming, too? He's had a notice to him? Not Drez Vina. No. I take notes! I'm going to find his name, don't you guys worry, then I'm going to bring it right up. Let's hop in a tree. We'll head home. We'll send our butler. Yes. They'll be very wonderful to him. I can't find it. Oh no. Eskil Ryndarien was the one I was thinking of. He looks good. Yeah! We should go soon, though. Right? Pike! I thought you were in Vasselheim! So you've been scrying to us the whole time from here? Why didn't you say anything? Have you seen the prisoner here? Hello? What was that? Heading out? I go up and hug him, and say what would you like us to tell Uriel? I know they are wanting you in court. Of course. Of course not, darling. I stay and walk around his room a little bit. I come down the stairs at this point. Yeah, why is he still in that cell? (singing) His name was Lola-- Desmond. Desmond? Desmond! Desmond, I had it right here, right there. Desmond. It's beautiful. And growing. Desmond, dear? Before you do, could we ask a small favor of you? Would you mind speaking on our behalf to Emperor Uriel? Emperor? Sovereign Uriel. That'd be great. That'd just be wonderful. Thank you. And you can, you know, come out of the cell and eat with us, now. Oh, right now! Sure, let's go then. Good to see you too. Eggs, baked beans-- Are there days of the week? What is a weekend? Oh, we were just saying how well you look. Pike, no Pike didn't know he was here. No, it's fine. Oh no. I thought Desmond was like a teenager. Is he, how young is he? Can you grow back his digits? How about we don't talk about this in front of other people? I think that is a beautiful, beautiful gesture. No. I mean, you grew one of Liam's, Vax's toes back. That's beautiful. -- 20! That's awesome! And it doesn't hurt anymore. Stop telling him what to give him. Yes, see. And that way, dear brother, he won't be on the road with lots of gold in his pocket to get stolen. That's why we have that fabulous crystal. Long time ago. Oh god. Wait, can I just ask, because we had three days and I didn't check on it, I had that jewelry box that we stole from the Tylieri house? I didn't ever look in it. Because we just took it and set it aside. And I have this whole thing of jewelry. And I also have a bloody bag of gold and a bag of gems that I never checked in on. All right. Awesome! And then the jewelry box? Is any of it, you know, magical? I'm keeping the jewelry box, 'cause I want it. And I'll add the 150 to our party funds. Because I'm generous. All right, yeah, let's go to court. Scanlan had them. Oh wait, wait, did we send anybody ahead with our letters? Yeah, he's, you know. Potentially. We did leave town. All right. We'll just follow behind him and stay at a distance. I can read lips. What do they say? Ooh, yeah, yeah, he was under their control, I think. Man, I need to organize my notes better. Got it all written down somewhere. Wait, what are you doing? I'll step up behind you. I follow suit. Plus they may be able to enchant your crown so it has some, you know, special mind-control fighting abilities. Just, you know, throwing out some ideas. That's all. Are you looking for something specific? Oh, yes, actually, that is something we discovered on our own. Oh, that's right, I guess we don't need him to testify-- Especially not against harpies. Probably not lute-playing, I'm gonna just throw that out there. I walk rocks hand him, on the back of his arm, just like that. Of course. I would right now, but I don't have any on me, how crazy is that? Hide it around. Put some in your shorts, put some in your shoes-- Uriel, we'll leave you to your business, but if you need any help finding anyone, we're here for you. Of course. Better than I expected, to be sure. The dickhead that built our frigging keep! Yeah, I mean he's built-- he's built a lot, but I assume he's probably built secret entrances into different places. Can I search his room? Are we allowed to do that? I mean, he did ask-- So you can gain better control. Anyway, I want to go check out his room. Why would Gilmore know? He's just staring at you. Council members coming through. I'm gonna perception check the whole room to see-- 23 for me. In a teleportation circle? Oh. The glyphs, I saw them at the ziggurat. Keyleth, Pike, do you know anything about-- Is this like an anti-scrying glyph set? Why do we need to shake him down, hey! Do you know the last time-- who the last person was that saw this gentleman? What was the servant's name? The guard just keeps notes. Good cop, bad cop? Lost. Okay... Oh my god! You're gonna kill him! Jeez Louise. Trinket goes up and licks his face. We should go check out this tavern, then. Yeah. And maybe go to the bathroom there. What a good idea. Good idea! He's at the tavern, right? I mean. Oh my gosh. 42. Smugglers. There's a tavern! Really? Are you sure? Where? At the tavern? We busted in there! Oh, shit. I think it's a perfect time to take a break and then-- Somebody needs to go to the bathroom. What?! What's wrong with your stupid foot? What's that sound? Is somebody popping popcorn?! You have two extra cloaks? You gave me one and then you have another one? No no no, do your shit Scanlan, we'll just look around. I keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn't-- any of us. Nice haul, Samson. We are. (laughs) You can call us The S.H.I.T.s. Scanlan's a kingslayer. (laughs) Are you leaning on something, Doctor? Doctor, we're quite skilled but we have a bit of a name for ourselves as well. I'm afraid we may not be able to help you out. He didn't say his name. What district does he live in? Wow, that's a good insight check. Secrets, secrets. Pillaged? Pretty sure it's already been cleaned out. Unless you're hearing things we don't know about. All right. How long have you been here? Hmm. Have you noticed-- I'm sure you've seen many people come in and out, but an older gentleman dressed much nicer than he should be in an establishment like this? A few days ago? Did he? Yes. Did you see where he went? Really? Are there rooms here? Yeah. I get up and leave the table and go talk to the barkeep. I'm going to talk to the barkeep and talk about rooms, potentially, first. Just seeing what they have available, and what's being rented right now. Hi. You have rooms, yes? Do you have an older gentleman? Elven, battle scars-- I describe him-- staying here right now? Insight-check her? That's okay. 23? Yeah. So many people come in and out. It would be so easy to lose sight of somebody like that who came in. I put five gold pieces onto the countertop. It sure would be wonderful if you could remember anything about him being here, however. Completely understandable. Thank you for your time! Scanlan, could you have your wonderful friends create a distraction? Just enough so we can slip unnoticed downstairs. All right. We've been here. We've barged in here before. Well, why do we have to-- why is it dangerous? Why can't we just go in and ask for him and get him? Aren't you still-- I look at your hand-- don't you have the mark? I mean, that's what I mean. I've seen it. You guys? Where are you? I put my hood up before I head back that way. (quietly) Oh no. Oh, I get advantage. Yeah! 25. You called the kitchen staff out? Oh, and... Trinket. 16. Is that bad? What else-- Oh, shit. I hear it. I come out of the kitchen very sneakily. Oh! Oh, my bear! I've been looking everywhere for you. Trinket! What are you doing in this tavern! Oh, dear! We should probably head outside! You and me, Trinket! Fuck. I tell him-- Oh! Oh no, that's so sad! But I tell him to head back to the keep, I guess. To the keep! 'Cause what else? He can't just hang out without us there! Really? Oh, deception, deception. I lead Trinket outside and I see them come out the alleyway! Okay, yeah. So I have Trinket hang out in the alley and stay there and wait for us. Be safe, Trinket! If any danger comes your way, intimidate them and run the other direction. Go home. I love you. You guys are evil for making me leave him. No, just me. I got 18. 18. Come on, Scanlan! You totally let her win and you're going to give her all your money? Do not give her your money! Do you take any of the gold out secretly before you hand it over to her? Oh god. Do you want to cry? Because I would want to cry. Fuck yeah, man. Me. It's so pretty. You speak the same languages as me. Oh, I also speak Undercommon. What about Draconic? But that's okay, Pike can read Dwarvish. You have a negative two modifier? (laughs) Don't you know Goblin, Scanlan? So wait, the top one is a yes. The middle one is a yes. The bottom one is a yes. We don't know. Yes. They all say enter, entry. Did you check for traps? Natural 20! Balls! Natural 20! Yes, and don't-- How about you don't unlock those ones. I'm walking away. Try the ones that aren't trapped first, please? Do the middle one. Try pushing the door. Do whatever you want to do. Try disarming them, sure, why not? Do your thing Good job, good job, brother. Do I see any tracks that look like they could have been from an elf, an old guy with some battle scars. 21. I would have had to roll a 20, I bet. Just take your shirt off. Show it to the world. I'm gonna cast Pass without a Trace on all of us. Not necessarily. I just cast Pass Without a Trace. Yeah, we're down here, obviously we belong. Beautiful. Let's do it. I've got no flying. I used my only flying potion. Not a soul. We didn't exactly break in, we just kind of-- I'm just shutting up. Where's he going? Uriel has a lot of gold and will probably give a reward. But Scanlan, you said we were going to keep that for ourselves. No. Can I help him? Can I assist that? Oh, well. Ah, damn it. That's all we need. We'll leave it outside the door. He was going for it! Whoa, I think it opens a portal to another plane. Did you give him the password? I think we were saying the password made it work. I think he knows it's super powerful magic anyway and he doesn't give a shit and he's taking it anyway. Can you Wall of Stone the other side of the hallway? Just to block them from coming down that hallway again. Can you block, Wall of Stone that other side? I thought the one he left through. Into his cell. He just completely took an expensive thing and left us to rot, pretty much, I think. I'll go down with Scanlan on the other one so I can ranged attack-- I'm gonna stand with my back against the wall that she's built up. Like that, yeah. Yeah. 26. Isn't he old? I call out Daxio, don't be a moron. Step outside and lower your weapon, you're surrounded. My deep voice! To intimidate him more. 13. Should I walk forward or should I keep-- I mean, as far as we know. SAM; Why don't you check the other door? Yeah. I'm just going to-- I'm going to stay where I am, I guess. Oh! Can I have used my bonus action to hide? Natural 20. I don't know what you can do. Can we take his weapon from him since he can't move? Do it, Pike! That's good. Oh wait, it might be higher than that. No. All right. I guess I walk-- Look at us all bunched up in this little hall. I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm going to just call out you're being really stupid, obviously. You are outnumbered. You are frozen. You should probably just, you know, give up. Okay, until Grog. I want to hold my action until Grog gets him to move. Until he moves out of-- Do I have to say what I'm going to-- I want to, if anything attacks us, I want to be able to attack it. Don't you wish we had Trinket now? Can we move his muscles or is he frozen? Can we handcuff him while he's frozen? Weren't you holding your turn until Grog moved him? Oh right. Sneak Attack you just get the additional six, remember? And then add your six. (gasps) It may help. Commune with Nature. Come on! Roll so high. This guy sucks. No. Brother. Come on. What are you gonna do? How long does the spiritual weapon last? Me? Okay. Oh no, should I go in the room? I feel like I don't want to. I just, okay. You know what? I'm gonna Hunter's Mark him. Seriously? Well then fuck it, I'm gonna just stay where I am. I'm gonna keep point. I'm gonna stay at the back of the hallway, just in case. Again, still hiding. You don't double it. Who's gonna tie him up? Who's in the fucking room? And pull him out of the room. Anyone? Can I toss Grog my-- some of the infinite rope and tell him to tie him up, tie up his ankles too. Yeah, but he's got his ankles tied up. He wouldn't be able to get a firm grip on the swing, it'd be like. (gasps) With the new weapon? Wait, wait, keep him alive. Are you talking about Dres-- Vecna? Are you talking about Vecna? Oh, that's a yes. Let's get this fucker out of here. That's true, he had a lot of money with him. I'm gonna hang out by the door, I'm gonna let him hang out. I'm sure you do, but you lost yours so I'm gonna hold on to it for you. I take it. No, we're not. We're going to leave through the alley, where Trinket is waiting. We can toss him over Trinket's back. We just walk on out. Hey darling. Could you do us a favor and carry him? 2,600 gold to get some booty, I like it.
