This is what happens when you get half the cast in a session together. Oh man, yeah! On Tuesday, I think it was Tuesday, we finally got to admit, I got to say that I was in Gears of War 4. (cheering) Any idea. I know, I'd already had a bunch of messages on Twitter, but I couldn't confirm them until the 8th, and I finally can. TRAVIS and But in conjunction with that, Liam McIntyre, who is one of-- he also leads in the game-- I know, right? I already like him because his name is Liam, but, and I also like him because he's a nerd. And I say this because he just started a Kickstarter for a card game that he developed called Monster Lab, so if you guys want to check it out, it's really really cute, it's really really fun, I think it's been going for like 15 days. They're doing really well on the Kickstarter but now they're going for stretch goals, so. Monster Lab. They're so cute! Hey, look at this beautiful box. No. No. Well, that's true, but we used it right away and we got here 20 minutes earlier than him. Solid announcement. Do you know about those? You should use Waze. (laughter) It's a lake. So we know it's relatively close, we should probably head there. I feel like we need to, we told-- We keep changing places and nobody's going to know where we are. Pike is in Whitestone. How do we let her know we're moving? Or are we coming back here? To the Loch. Let's leave word at the Slayer's Take that we're heading out. So if, you know, Allura or Pike shows up wanting to find us-- So, wait, a couple days and then we're heading out? I thought we were heading out now. Are you coming with us? Well. Can we wait a day? To the Loch. Okay. I feel like we're missing something, wait, you're trying to get us passage to the back-- Or are you trying to get us to the lake? I'm so confused. This is out of character, I literally don't have an idea what's going on. Here's the thing. Also, our lady Keyleth, the beautiful princess that lives among us, she has a way she can travel us very very quickly through trees, so we don't actually need passage. So unless we're getting supplies and we need to travel with a lot of things, then, you know, we don't actually need passage. Do you think that this is going to lead to some serious fighting? Because it sounds like these Vestiges are well-guarded. I'm sure. You know what, Grog, that's an excellent point. Hanging on a tree branch under the lake. Roll a 20 and add it to your history. So 11. Well, we just loaded up on a bunch of potions. Some dickhead. Let's try it. Well, we're not going to get there before dark, so maybe we should sleep here tonight and start out in the morning. Maybe the Slayer's Take knows more about the lake, about these Vest-- no, these are pretty secret, I think the Vestiges are a pretty well-kept secret, people aren't going to just know where they are. I wonder if somebody knows about a cavern under the lake. Or maybe we need to breathe under-fricking-water. Is there a library nearby? I've got a pretty decent investigation. You and me, brother. All right. 23. Is somebody watching me at the moment? Are we just perusing a bookstore, or--? I sit down on the ground and start reading through the book. And see if I can find information. Oh, hi! I keep reading. Oh, I thought this was a library! Of course, well, can I just check and make sure that it's actually got any information that I need? Because if it doesn't then I don't want to buy it. You understand. All right, of course, yes. Are you just going to stand there and watch me peruse then? Well, I just start looking for what I need. I just don't know, I can't really tell if it actually has anything interesting. What's the back? That's 30 gold! 30 gold. It's so dusty, though, I mean is that even worth it if it's this dusty? 30 gold? Does it have spells in it? No. Oh. Oh. No! I hold onto it. Well, I know people that, you know, care about dirty old books, so I guess, I mean, I might be willing to purchase it for them, but they usually like things in mint condition when they buy their antiques. This has a damaged spine, I see it, and yellowing of the pages. And it seems like somebody's bookmarked this one. Oh. This is the worst haggling ever. What's your name? (groaning) 18? I feel hurt, and I pull out 30 gold and I say, I suppose-- (weakly) I'll buy it. Damn it! It hurts! It hurts me in my soul. It is, actually. The first time. I kind of respect you. I'm a little impressed. Benjamin Cole. You're a dear. (cackles) Yeah, he was. Not on the anniversary, Matt! Not on the anniversary. There's definitely going to be ghosts there. Kashaw? Do your holy shit when we go there, all right? Oh, really? Is it not, like, Sarenrae? Sarenrae? Is that your god? You're married to a god?! Wait, you're married and you-- Good times. I want to hear more about this. Not in Vasselheim! Grog, how could you?! My brother! Best friends forever. (gasps) We're off. You know what? That's true. All right. I just think, outside of Vasselheim, you know, things come out at night, but whatever. If you guys think this is the most brilliant decision, I'm on board. So much wisdom. Keyleth, can't you turn us all to mist, and then we poof there? Then we could be there before the evening. Can you Mist Walk us all, including Trinket? Horses would die out there. Yay! Let's do it. (ghost noises) We probably should have talked out our plan before we did this. We can talk in mist form? That's awesome. From above, could I see any sort of caverns or openings in the ground, or something that looked like caves? That's what I was keeping my eye out for as we went. 22 is what I rolled. Okay. Is this technically-- are we in the woods? Is this my favored terrain again? How do we stop being like this? Should we turn like people again? Tell Trinket to turn like a bear. Oh, can we talk normal? Oh. Tell him I love him. Killer. (gasps) Can we mist underwater? Can farts travel underwater? That's kind of cool. Or we'll drown. Thank you, Grog. Can I go hit the place where Grog hit his head and see if I can crack a hole in the ice? This is going to suck! And I put my head underwater to see if I can look around. Oh, shit! Oh, with disadvantage. Doesn't it count as disadvantage by destroying the rest of my dice? Perception. That is a 31? No, 41. Yeah, 31. What?! (gasps, coughs) It's down there. Oh, it's so cold! My poor little feathers are like, poo. How deep does it look? Oh. Good, good. Is there any way-- because I have this horrible feeling that we're going to get underwater, and then we won't be able to get out because it's covered in ice. Can we melt the ice? Can you do something? Walk carefully. I feel like we should. We didn't rest?! We're idiots. Let's camp-- oh, god. I'm going to try to mist down and just see if I can. I'm concentrating on making myself a fart. He's doing it, too. Can we go in as gas? I go back up. Oh, killer. Let's try to set up camp in the trees, so we're not on the ground. Any sign of her, Kash? Oh! Natural 20. Maybe Keyleth can find out something. With your tail? (yelps) Did it seem like a perfect circle, Zahra, or was it jaggedy? How soft was the ground when you dug into it? It was softer than the rest of the ground? Sounds to me like a creature that would burrow. Do I know of any creatures that are underwater-- Is it like the worms that we encountered before? It's possible it's a creature that's burrowing, or it's possible that's an opening into our underwater cavern, and nothing can grow there. You're going underwater now? It's freezing cold! She's really attractive now, isn't she? That shark. Huh? (laughter) Sounds like a creature. (laughs) Pucker point. We should settle down to sleep. As we're settling down to sleep, I make sure that Trinket is laying between Kash and Keyleth, always. Yeah. Trinket, keep Keyleth warm. She's cold. She was in the water. You need to rest. You got beat up. You go to sleep. I'm going to stay up for a little bit because I'm fine. We climb up in the tree and keep watch. It's difficult. Trinket's very thankful. Oh, shit. He went to bed. I was awake. It's okay, I'm good. 34. Trinket-sized furry entities? I can't see if they're actually bears. I cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone around me, and I stealth. We're already stealthed. 24. Owlbears! Let's just watch them. We just sit and enjoy this magical moment of seeing the rare owlbear in person. Did they leave any feathers behind? After they get away, I want to climb down and gather the feathers that they left behind. Okay! I want to fletch an arrow. Owlbear arrows. Oh, shit. Really? You know. Those ones I have. Okay. I have thieves' tools because I'm a thief now. I stole them, dude. Matt told me I have thieves' tools! Dick. 27. 27 dexterity. Shut up! These are special. Cool. Shut up. I'm writing, "two owlbear arrows." Oh, I warn them there's owlbears in the area before I go to sleep. Ah! Fuck you! I have Pass Without a Trace cast on us-- Shitballs... (laughter) It's the cow-roc. When we were cows! When we saved a roc. Oh shit, Percy. You've seen it? MARY and I elbow him. You're snoring a-fucking-gain-- I wake up. Can you guys talk a little quieter? Some of us are sleeping. I guess we should breathe underwater and head down, right? Extended period. I can, well. I have really good perception, so. I can go down and see if I can find an opening that you guys didn't see yesterday. Could you, like, make a, you know, parting of the Red Sea sort of thing? Try that. Oh, that's good. Useful. That could be useful if something was attacking and they wouldn't attack fish. I'll run in, search around. We'll all run in, search around like maniacs for ten minutes. Let's do it and run down and search. I feel like that's killing a lot of wildlife. Keyleth, I have total faith in you. You know what? I'm running in. And Keyleth, just be ready to throw it away. I run in and start looking for anything. I'm going to that and seeing if there's something there. I go to the hole, to the "ahnus," and start looking. Oh, I just stepped right in, because I'm really smart, you guys. Hold onto me. I'm going. I'm sinking. Grog? Grog, help. Seriously, quick. Come on, come on. Grog, help! I take out my Rope of Infinite Twine and throw it to Trinket's mouth from far away. Pull. Me. Out. This sucks, you guys! Grog, why are you being a dick-fuck? I need to get out of this mud. Seriously? Great use, Keyleth. We found an entrance point. Ish. You're not going to even help? Cool. Seriously, we're dying! We're going to die. Yes. Please get us out with Bigby. Can you scoop out all the mud in that fucking hole that just tried to kill us? Once we're in and water's covering it, we're not going to be able to get these stones away. Oh! That's true, if something happens you can put it up. Hey, you know what? We're not doing anything for you, you fuck, 'cause you didn't even try to help us. We didn't even talk about how it's our one-year anniversary-- That is paper. Oh my gosh, it's so beautiful. Mine too! Is yours just you? 'Cause mine is just me and Pike! We can show it? And this is artwork by Wendy. Baby, baby creatures! (sing Imperial March) (all warble Imperial March) We're moving-- But we should probably, I don't know, stealth? I don't know what would be alive down here, but there might be undead. Actually, can I take a moment and use Primeval Awareness and sense if there's any undead entities around, any ghostly or undead zombies? Anything undead? Aberrations? Let's start with undead. Up to six miles. One thing. I cast Pass Without a Trace on the group. Can we stealth? Oh, that's true. We are really camouflaged. No, add ten to it. 28. You know what? I bet if they live in the dark, light will blind them. Guess what? There's fish people up ahead. Can you see us? We can't see anything. Should we get some light? I have a question. In my book that I bought for 30 gold, did it mention what level of the multi-level tomb the champion was buried on? I got played. It was a worthless 30 gold, then. Vax. Can you guys keep it down? I can hear you from here. Is it a dead end? So it's a wall in front of you. Do you see any openings down there? Shit. Wait, wait. You're going down into the snotty-- It's really fucking dark. I want to keep an eye out for any traps or anything. I want to look for any imperfections in the stairs that look like they could collapse at any time or they could be unsafe. 28 for me. Can I crouch down and look at it and see what it is? Do they look like the owlbear feathers that I picked up earlier? Hey, Keyleth? Have you ever seen feathers like this? Why were they covered in goo? Fuck. The Raven Queen. Right, that makes sense. Thank you. You guys ravens. Yeah. Oh, was I supposed to still be at disadvantage? 26. Does it look like traps? You want to perceive them? Wow, you're really smart. Can I perceive around and see if I see any switches or anything that would turn them off? This wouldn't be Underdark-y at all, would it? Then I rolled a ten. Someone with little gnome hands, maybe. So it's wide enough for your fingers. I pat his little head as I walk through the blades. Not his cube. Just the top of his head. (laughter) Walk quietly, dear. You have a-- wait. You can fly? I could maybe try to leap from the sides of the hole or something. I could totally parkour that. (whispering) I think we should go down. Can we look down? Can we just look down? Three. That little ledge won't support-- I mean, is it a long hallway that ends abruptly, or is it this much space? I drop something down into-- a rock that I find-- and drop it down into the hole. (long pause) It's pretty deep, guys. Can I, since it's only five feet away on the left, can I look around and see if it looks like there's any similar sort of traps or anything down that hallway? I hop over to the doors, too. 31. You rolled for Trinket? (gasps) Oh my god. Can I leap forward and try to grab him? Trinket turns and puts his claws into Grog's hand. Good to know you can jump at all. Are your hands okay? Are the doors locked? Are there traps on the door? I check for traps. 16. (door squeaking sound) I push? Oh good, more darkness. Like a platform like a tomb? Can I stealth? I want to stealth. And perceive-- I'm going to, like, step in. 20. Oh! 30, because of Pass without a Trace, which is still on us. (whispers) There's definitely creatures in here. I don't know if they're hostile. (whispers) Can I just shoot an arrow? I do. (gasps) Ohh! I forgot! Wait! (gasps) Shh! (whispers) They know we're here. Obviously, you threw a fucking rock. They want to fight us-- whatever it is they're protecting-- this champion's-- You want me to just yell it out? Cool. Hey, there's people on the other fucking side, and they're going to attack us when we walk in here. They're saying to defend his fucking tomb. SAM and I'm stealthing to the side. I want to get up and meet him at a-- I use my earring and I whisper, they're calling to their master! Something big. I stay stealthed. Rolled stealth? Yeah, everybody still has Pass Without a Trace. Was I supposed to roll stealth at all on that? 35. 21. Uh huh-- nine, ten-- Awesome. I'm going to-- ooh! Is this Sneak Attack, because I'm stealthed? Oh, okay. I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on the guy in the middle, 'cause everything within ten feet is hit. Oh, you know what? I was using those little blocks as feet marks-- is that? It wouldn't get the two guys down-- Okay. So let's do the middle guy and-- yeah. Aw man, which one, which one? Let's do this-- That's 30? 30. No, 28. Lightning Arrow is 4d8 lightning damage. Okay. 27 plus sneak attack? 29. 15. Okay. 13. I'm going to move-- Yeah, I'm going to move behind that wall there. Yeah. Trinket is going to-- Move-- I don't know where that is-- move behind the pillar. Can he get there? Maybe? Yes. Yeah. Cool. No sneak attack. I thought you said it didn't get sneak attack-- That's better. (gasps) No. (muffled) Oh my god! You! I don't remember all the things, I don't remember all the things! Oh no! Got it, got it, got it. Good to know. (gasps) Oh my god. Is she unconscious or is she awake? Oh no! Okay, she's alive. Six. Seven. Your ranged attack bonus? 11. 6d12!? Holy crap, girl! Okay. Am I-- can it see me in its eye? Would I be in its thingy? I'm going to move stealthily along the wall so I can maybe be out of that thing. Can I be? Fuckin' shit bitch. Am I hiding? Am I still hidden? No, I don't want to do that, I just want to make my motion hide behind a pillar, maybe. Yeah, I appreciate it. My pouches are still pretty heavy. I'm going to hold my action until he's looking away from me. And I want to move Trinket behind the wall. So now when it looks down at us, does it change the direction of the cone? Add your inspiration, add your inspiration. Whenever you need it, but you have an inspiration dice here. That's good. So you're at 18. Where did the beam come out of? Where's the eye? Where's the phantom eye? Just do it. Can I ask a technical question? If I've held my action until he does something and he never does it, do I ever get to go? I just hold it until the end of the turn? It's good to know I'm gambling that away if-- I didn't do Hunter's Mark on purpose. Because I can't do any magic on him, because he's looking at me. Say 'screw it.' 12s. You need 20s for attacks. Plus your attack modifier. Oh no. I don't think so. I use my action, since that's the end of it, right? I pop out and I shoot two arrows at him. (grunts) That's it. Just like (groans). Because of my bracers. No. I know, but my bracers only add to damage. Four to damage?! Why four? Well, this one is 29. 20. Yeah. Oh, god. That's pathetic. Five. Ten. Everybody's hiding. Oh, that's right. He can't attack anything within his own cone. I am going to-- (scoffs) If I run back to where I was standing, am I out of its fricking cone? All right, I'm going to do that. (laughter) All right. Back to all my magical stuff. All right, I'm going to shoot from my Sky Sentinel at him. That's my first attack for that, and that is 22 for the first arrow, because it splits. 20. No, that was wrong. No, that's right. Oh, that was weird. 16? Okay, so that adds 1d6 to my damage with those. Okay. Balls. Eight, nine, ten. 16 for the first. 14 for the second. And then my second attack, I want to shoot through my Blazing Bowstring at it. 17? Oh, no, that wasn't one of my owlbear arrows, for sure. I'm going to duck behind the wall right there, if I can. No! Okay, I push Trinket out and make him run around and hide behind the other wall. (laughter) I love you! Move. He's got 40, so technically he could make it behind that other wall. What the-- Everything at the walls. Anything hiding. This is our spot! I duck so he can shoot. Me? It can see me? Okay. 21. Yeah. 14. Kill him, Grog! 36 for the first. Me! I was taking a snapsnot. It didn't make any sense at all. Fuck! Okay. 24? 23, it's 23. Kill him, Keyleth! Mmm, I shouldn't say it. Do you get to stay as an earth elemental if you're right in front of him? They don't work in front of him, right? They're magic? Okay, Zahra, you're going to get him. I can feel it. Those are all 12s, yes. Times two-- 70. I immediately call out, help Kash! I run to look over the edge to take care of Kima, too. I'm pulling the rope out and trying to lower it over the edge. If you'd gone down there, I would've jumped right down there. Look for any loot! I'm trying to-- Brother, I'm going to go look at the stuff that they're finding, okay? Be safe! And I run over to the sarcophagus. (laughs) All good, Kima! It's infinite rope! Can we perception check the tomb and see if it's safe to grab shit out of it? One. For Trinket! Six for Trinket! It's a good night, you guys. I'm unconscious. Trinket-- Yeah. I'm going to throw up. Oh no. (whispered) That's good. That's good. What happened? I feel so cold. Knocked out? (sighs) Well, that was a close one. (laughs) Did we find anything? (exaggerated sobbing) God. Why are you crying? What happened? What? All right, all right. Your breath is lovely. Okay. How did I-- I feel-- I feel cold? How am I not dead, then, if I died--? (softly) Vax-- Wait, Percy, did you set off a trap? Is that how I died? (laughing nervously) Well-- who brought me back? Oh. Oh. Yes! Yeah, yeah, give me some of that. It'll warm me up. We need to get those-- those leathers, those vestiges or whatever, and get the-- out of here. Can we not-- can we investigate it and see if there's any traps? I mean, how do we make sure it doesn't happen again? Thank you, dear. We need rest! I feel like we should maybe camp and sleep and rest up and get-- I don't know, it's up to you guys. Okay. (whispers) Thank you, Zahra. Want to kill it. Both of you? Yes! We'll meet you in Whitestone! We could all head that way, actually. Do we need to go back, I don't know, sleep for the night? I had just rolled an investigation, before I could even-- I had just rolled to check for traps and then you pulled the stuff. No, you know what? Thank you-- all of you-- for not-- A 12, okay. What were you aiming for? He survived, he didn't even go below zero on that hit. I was just already at 41, so it lowered me. He had four hit points left. I know! No, believe me, I am aware that my greed fucking did that to me. I am aware. Ashley was texting as it was happening. Like, "No!" Still.
