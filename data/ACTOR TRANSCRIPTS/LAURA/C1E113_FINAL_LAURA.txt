Yeah, we're going to put her in a locked room. I was just showing this off before the stream. We have this amazing Matthew Mercer shirt. (cheering) So hey, that's in the store. That's in the store right now. And it's subtle, I like that anybody that doesn't know what it is would just think it's a cool silhouette shirt. And then anybody that does know what it is, it's like they're "in." He's smirking evilly. It's an evil smirk. That's what inspired us to do it. Because Critters are awesome. Of all time? Why yes, we leave tomorrow morning actually. And we're also going to be in Australia in a couple weeks, or this November. Are you working on any kind of shows or anything? So that we can do some spells that will be in effect for a day. Potentially. So we should do some of our spells right before we go to sleep. I don't know! We do need to do Heroes' Feast. I have one chalice left. Unless we leave him a plate. Then we need to do that right when he gets back. Yeah, hopefully he'll be back before-- We'll wait a few hours to see if he shows up and then we'll cast it to see because we need time to be able to do it. Yes. I'm going to start the Heroes' Feast, I'm just going to get the chalice. That's actually really smart. Wow, that's really smart, Grog! That took a lot out of you. Here. You can cut me. Just do it, we'll heal him up. Back of his knee?! Are you trying to take him out of commission for future fights? That's really terrible. I want to cast Cure Wounds at third level on Percy. He smells? He likes to put on a show. Oh that's smart, okay. Okay. That's interesting, we didn't notice that before. So Sylas is back. So my blessing, from Pelor. Hashtag blessed. Gives radiant damage to anything evil that attacks me with a spell. That's pretty neat, huh? I have a feeling radiant damage is going to be really important in this fight. What? You've just been wearing it and it's not done anything? You're speedy, of course. I could do it. I have a broom after all. But Pike can fly now too. She can fly. Ten minutes is a long time if it's right at the beginning of the fight. It's pretty tight. Oh my god you can fucking fly! So do you think you're stronger, and you're more proficient with actual melee weapons, right? Because I don't think I can shoot a trammel from my bow. Okay, let's have Pike hold the other one. So Pike, you're the third. And we have to protect our cleric. Fighting. Oh, so we got to bloody him up and then-- We don't know, if we try it with the trammel and it doesn't work, it doesn't break the trammel, we just have to try again? Oh wait, who's holding the fragile one? You're holding the fragile one. Can you still cast if you're a dragon or something? There's coffee all over it. This got put in the dishwasher, and the leather got cooler after it got put in the dishwasher. The thing is if you're flying you can get knocked off, I've been there, and then it's super bad, so actually the pillars are really wonderful in that regard. He could be off of the tower, yes, and then it's all ranged attacks, that's what we have. Hopefully we'll be able to take out the Briarwoods before the fight. He was above us, but if he goes off of the tower. Scanlan. Scanlan. If you promise you won't run away, I'll put this fucking hat back on. And I bring out the stupid pointy hat that he gave me. Natural 20! And then J'mon Sa Ord will be able to help us. Help us! That's good, we go over the walls first. Here's the good thing about us bamfing to the Feywild, right. They think we left, and if we all actually stick together and don't fuck up with this fucking ring next time, they won't know that we're there again. Because last time they had an idea because you guys, you know, almost died as we were going in. He is. How dare you. If they Dispel that won't he just turn into Trinket and he'll fall? Trinket? Okay. Bud? If you fuck this up, Scanlan! Oh, I don't have any more spells, do I, to do it? He can understand me, I just can't understand him, with my Speak With Animals. Shit. Okay. Oh, it's 1st-level, I have a 1st-level left. Okay, here's the thing, Scanlan wants to turn you into something that flies. Good job. Yeah. Would you be willing to-- are you okay with that, for the actual big-- I mean, you could be up close and personal with fucking Vecna. Yeah? Aw. You can do it. Don't hurt him! Okay. A wyvern. Yeah. Oh, so you could use that tonight. I think Polymorph tomorrow and then use your 9th-level spell for something major. Because he can use a 9th-level spell tonight for something. As we're doing this, we're making the feast, because we're about to get ready to go to bed, right? Yeah, so we make our feast before we go to sleep. Oh, shit. You can turn Trinket into a dragon? Yeah. Right. Artagan can join us. Okay. Hey, Artagan, can you look at this wand? This wand in my hand. It was a wooden wand from one of Vecna's people that I hijacked. Oh, do you have to attune? Okay. Great. All right. Thanks. As soon as we go to sleep and wake up. Oh, good. Privacy. Oh. I vote Scanlan. And he'll just hang around with us? Second Scanlan hangs around with us until what? Yeah, let's do that. I'm sure they have truesight. Vecna's a god. Of course he can see everything. Oh, shit. So he's going to know even, like, he's going to know Trinket's not a fucking-- Is that seen on truesight? Oh, no, he's actually that animal. So he'd have to know. Yeah, exactly. Fuck it. Do it! We are doing the pillars, if he's not doing something on Trinket. Scanlan, do something so that we can sleep. So you should've started that earlier. I know! What's done is done. How do we know you're not the real Scanlan? Shut up, Scanlans! Oh, yeah. Other Scanlan can wear things? He's fully-- Oh, yeah, put on that armor that I gave you. Put him in the armor I gave you that you don't wear. Acid resistance. No, I have cold now. It was-- Yeah, that's what it was. What about the wand of plus one, for the spells? It's a war wand. Oh god. This could be it, huh? Oh. That's true. You know what? We're doing it for a good cause, though. Saving the world. No regrets. I had a good run a few years before that, but this is pretty great. Yeah. It gives him strength. (whispers) I know. We need to, though. We can totally take this guy. Fuck it. We're not going down. Yeah. Exactly. Fuck him. We've got other gods on our side. He's a fucking half-ass god. That's right. And you-- You're not going anywhere. Good night. Just barely. Trinket's back in the necklace for the bamfing over. In the building, now! Oh, that's good. 35. No, you don't know! You don't know! I thought they could be trapped under the wall or something. Does it look like-- (pained noise) All of the damage. No! Don't do it! Welcome to the game, Joe! Can we see, does it look like he's got hands and eyes complete? I throw out the Rope of Entanglement. On the gloomstalker. You're two people again! How does it feel? 24. The Rope of Entanglement, is what I was going for. I can't find my-- Yeah. Does it look like anybody's noticed us? 33. Will this thing obey you? We should get inside. I let go of the rope and go back in the building so that we can hide. I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. Stealth check! No, she's got plate armor. Yeah, you got your boots. Yeah, so you don't roll at disadvantage anymore. Yeah. You got non-clanky boots. Add ten to your roll. Oh, shit. Are you going to let him do that to your girl? Oh, God darn it. I shoot an arrow into its eyeball. 35. 25 damage. Oh, and I get to do it again? 18? 18, does that hit? Okay. 18. How did you get here? Oh, he's evil. That's evil. That's the evil dragon. Potentially. Oh, yeah, you should give us a speech. How long does that last? Later, then. Oh no! No, those are tens. That is such a bummer. It's okay; the meal didn't do a lot, apparently. Oh, tight, tight, tight, tight. Right before. That only lasts for an hour. Here's the thing. Do we go for the outer walls to take out the shield first? Probably. Once we go in, we're going in. Of Thar Amphala, yes. We don't have to take out the walls. We have to break a couple of the crystals. Hey! You remember our old plan of just set everything on fire? Let's set everything on fire! We saw them when we were in the city before. She knows? So they don't necessarily know you're in the city. Okay. All right, cool. Okay, stealthily, let's try to make it to the outer wall so that we can cut out some of these crystals. 30. Does it look like there's an area that the pulses are brighter, along the wall? Are we close to one of those pulses? Okay. I see where one of the crystals is; let's move towards that. Plus ten. 29. I would have liked if he had signed it. We got to get these shields down so that Vasselheim can actually have-- MARISHA and How thick is the wall? And we saw the crest before because there was a doorway in the outer wall. Is there any kind of doorway around us? Yeah. How are you with doors? Can we see it? Like above the doorway? It's like on the other side? Do you think it's possible to, like, punch up on the archway and knock the crystal down? So happy about it. Try punching up. Is there a house nearby? Okay, we can get ready to run there. However, we're staying within 60 feet of you while you're punching. A double punch. 30 feet away? That's what I said; I'm staying within 60 feet of you. 19 hits a wall! It's a magic wall. 27? At least get in this building, there was that encased part, right? We're going to stay within 60 feet of each other. Within 60 feet of us. It's super important! If you're within 30 feet of me, you still get plus ten. Is it a boy or a girl gloomstalker? Oh no. Add ten. 33. No, 43. But we're within 60 feet of him, right? You said we weren't within 30. Okay. But you're still hidden from view from Vecna. (gasps) TALIESIN and But here's the thing, we're not going to have a better chance to get them away from Vecna. Should we attack them now? We can attack them now, away from Vecna. Are they landed? How far away is that? Oh my god. And they're on this? How did he know we would be here? Oh, it's okay, Briarwoods down. So we're in this building? Shit. Maybe he rolled really well on his dex save. There's windows! Okay. Oh my god. Okay. Can I run upstairs and look in that window? Okay. And Trinket is out. I bamf Trinket out but he's down by Grog. This is so intense! I can't believe we're fighting the fucking Briarwoods again! Oh shit. Oh god, oh god, oh god. In-game hour, not this game hour. Oh shit. 24 for me. 24. 24. You were looking me in the eye when you said it. Did you just fucking go father than 60 feet away from me? Just remember that because it's a thing during battle. They could, but we don't know. We could kill them before he knows. You are within 60 feet right now. That doesn't give you a bonus, it just keeps Vecna from seeing you. The only way we're going to get the drop on him is if he doesn't actually know we're here. We're going to kill them. I had a 24. Can I lean out the window and attack? Okay, I lean out the window, and can I see Delilah? Can I shoot at her? With my sharpshooter, she doesn't get any additional cover or anything. Okay, so I'm going to sharpshooter Delilah with one of my needle arrows that I've been hanging onto for a gajillion years. So that is a 25 to hit. Yes! Okay. Good. Is that sneak attack because she didn't know I was there, technically? Oh, Grog's standing right there! (counting) 31. Oh, no, 41 because I was sharpshootering. And then that one definitely doesn't hit. I know, but it still was a roll. It's 17. (scared noises) I'm going to use my bonus action to hide. Not that it matters, but I'm going to roll for stealth. That did nothing. 21? Nope, 31, because I still haven't cast Hunter's Mark. Okay, so it's Grog, Vex, Delilah. He's eight. Percy what? She's disintegrating the wall? Oh no. That's true; you could turn the whole thing. I'm like-- Oh, hello there. I didn't see you. ASHLEY and Man, I really wish we had some tape right now! Did you get the attack? Use the gaff tape. It's the best. 31. On all of us? That's good. That's minus the five? Now it's dead. Did they take damage from falling? That's an awesome-- Is that your Wyrmwood box? Oh, oh well. (laughter) Yas, Queen Tiamat! Kill that dragon. That'd be like if I had to fight undead Trinket. No! Oh my god no! Do not get turned! No, he doesn't because he didn't have the feast. Can you see Arkhan? Okay, good. What does this do, again? What does that do? Okay, okay. How do they get repaired? Is it like a Doty situation? How damaged is Scanlan Two already? What are you doing? Do you know Sylas and Delilah are right there? Sylas is right here. Right next to Sylas? You want both of you to be right behind Sylas? Do you want melee range, or do you want back ten feet? He can climb up walls? Because of Sharpshooter. That's a great way to roll. It's fine. You're talking about your disengage. Don't worry about it. Greataxe of the Eclipse? Sylas. Do you want me to get the tape? To try to land on the dragon? Feet stomping her chest? 35. 35 times two now? What do you get for the crit on Kas? What do you get for the crit? That's why I'm asking if you double your dice. Oh my god, so 51 plus 3d10. No. That's one hit? I like it when the music stops, we're like (hyperventilates). (gravelly) Chop her hand off! Chop off her whole arm. (singing) Please die Deliah, we want you dead. So do your damage again because that-- He wasn't doing his rage modifiers, so you could add that then, potentially? I bet she's a fucking clone. She made a clone of herself. Okay, so if I attack her, it's at disadvantage? Or with-- Well then I'm going to attack her. She's already restrained. Fuck it, I'm going to attack her with a blazing bowstring. Yes. 17 plus 14, with sharpshooter. Minus five. Oh god, 15 plus two is 17, 25, 30, plus the blazing bowstring, 37. That's everything, right? 47 for Sharpshooter! 47, I didn't Hunter's Mark it. Oh fuck! I point my finger down at her as I'm about to shoot the arrow. As it shoots, I keep pointing at her like How's it feel, bitch? How's it feel? Oh I feel so bad for him. I do have another attack! And I attack him. With blazing bowstring. Sharpshooter. So 28 minus five hits? 33 damage to him. Seven of which is fire damage. I'm going to run down the stairs to the lower level. Yeah, I'm in there. Two with one! Delilah's dead! He deflects the bullet?! He's looking at me? Oh no. No I ran away! He can't see me! I'm downstairs. What does it do when he shrieks? Destroy him! I like the magical flourish of the die. Out her eyeball. And Bigby's Hand. Does that work on a bat? Can you trip a bat? I need a food for my nervousness. You could break your tooth. Like here? Guiding Bolt, up the butt! You want to move forward so you can hit him? 6d6? All radiant! That is a really good roll. He's really far away from us now. Can you do anything at 120 feet, Scanlan? Yeah, you can't switch your initiative. Oh my God. Please, please, please. He's used up his legendary resistances, right? Advantage! Can you run 30 feet and then do something? I mean, as soon as Sylas isn't there, he's going to know we're here. Or we can all just run. If we hold, he just keeps moving-- Whose turn is it? Just try to get Sylas. Wait, why didn't I get to go? Can I run out the door and hop on my broom and fly as far as I can-- Yeah, but I can only get 50 feet away from you guys. If I come here-- So I can't leave. So I'm at the bottom of the stairs. If I run up the stairs and broom it from here, how far would I get? Ten feet out the window and he's 150 and I'm-- my shot is what, but with Sharpshooter-- no, that's different. Shit! Wait, let me look at Fenthras. I'm just hoping there's something that says it's 300 feet! (nervous laughter) Okay then, it's only 120-foot range, right? With a longbow? Oh, yeah! My max is 600 fucking feet? Okay then, I'm going to walk up to the window and I'm going to try to cast Bramble Shot on him. With advantage? 20. Oh my God. Okay, so 12, that's 18 plus 4d8. 43. And he has to make a strength save of DC 17 or be restrained. And does he take bludgeoning damage from hitting the ground? That was pretty awesome! Can I see him? 34. Misty cloud! How did we fight him before? Sunlight destroyed him before? Sunbeam destroyed him before. Now he's in the gaseous form. Okay, so I rolled a 34. He's 150 feet away. He's 150 feet away from us. So as a group we can all try to move forward, but as we get closer to him-- What's the Daylight casting distance? Can you run forward and get close enough? Hopefully. We have to stay together. I'm technically right here, right now. I'm on the second level. Next to Pike. No, it's Percy's turn. You could technically try to sh-- Oh yeah, mist form. (laughter) Well, you can get within 60 feet of me so just move toward-- Does it take him a long time? Whatever that sparking thing was. We book it towards the tower. Right? At the break we're giving away-- I don't know if that's-- I feel like, do we see any other doors, like, secret doors, maybe? Can I do that without letting the rot behemoth see me? We didn't really think about how we were getting up the tower, did we? Maybe the rot behemoth moves? Can you tell her to talk? Sorry, sorry, that's a thing. I placed my seed inside of her. I make everything weird, Matt. Just chop the tree down! It's a thin tree. That's sick. It's like she's got a built-in shield now. Now it looks like she's pregnant! That's terrible. (something clanks on the floor) Do we fly up, or do we go inside and up the tower? I'm sure there's no traps or horrible things on the inside of it. Of course. The little blue gem? I love it, I love it! Yeah, we'll drag it out of the doorway so we can kill it! Pull it back and we'll have one of the-- I mean, not that you're not strong and very-- Pass Without a Trace is still fucking up, if it's been less than an hour. I got 18. Plus ten! Can you have him climb up the side of the tower and meet you up top? Well, we can try it though. Because you rolled a luck? What? That's fucking badass! 37. We need that orb. Oh, we can get out of the way and let him maybe run into the undead that are-- No. Okay. Yeah, destroy undead. I don't know how many undead we're going to face-- But he might have, you know, I don't know what kind of army he's going to have up top, so it's up to you. So maybe do one of them? Oh, 18. You're at six proficiency bonus, now. You're not at-- So your DC is 19. Sorry, Matt. No! Don't do that to her! Did it do anything to the rot behemoth coming in? Should we kill this shit while we're stunned? How do we know we're not going to run into a whole bunch more? Okay, and then all these things are going to chase after us? So we might as well kill them now, while they're stunned. Pause for 30 minutes and heal? Beacon of Hope just means it heals the max that a healing spell or a healing potion can do. You don't automatically go to full health. That's okay. Do you have a healing spell for people? I don't think we have 30 minutes. I don't know, I mean, they're fighting at Vasselheim right now. We all need healing. I'm 40 points down. No, we don't have it anymore. Might as well take them. Can you try healing and see what it does? What does that do? You don't have beast shape? So short rest? Short rest. Okay. He might not be back full strength yet! He takes a while to rest up. It's going to take two hours to get up the tower? We need to not rest. I'm taking one. Well, you can do the speech as we climb up the tower! The speech does what? Does the speech regain hit points? So as we climb the tower, she could be saying it? A Greater Healing Potion is 4d4? Yes, I'm going to invoke my Blessing of the Dawnfather. Scanlan Two. Can anybody cast some Death Wards too? We're doing things, yeah. We're doing it. So I'm invoking the blessing as we get closer. The stairs are long, but they're not infinite. I feel so inspired, Keyleth. Thank you. In addition to our plus two, so now we have 21. Oh god, oh god, oh god. Okay, are we getting near the top? Okay, here's the thing. The people that have the trammels should probably have a Death Ward, too. Okay, you're good. Okay, so that bumps you back up once you've gone down once. So really, he needs-- and you, well, no. You won't come back right away. The right. No, wait! Which hand does Vecna chop off? Does this feel like it might be Delilah's room? Her chamber? Is there any traps in this room? What is that? Investigation? 14 for me. What if we go-- no, the people that are small go around. I'll bamf Trinket out on one side, put Grog in, go back, put Arkhan in, go back? We work our way around the runes. The zombies are little. They can work their way around. Are you guys okay with this plan? Oh, fuck. I thought we would be able to avoid it. Natural 20! Can Scanlan Two dispel that shit? Everybody else went already. You can Spider Climb to the ceiling! Good job, guys. Nice. We're fine. I like it. We should cast it now. We should do all of our casting. Now I invoke the Blessing of the Dawnfather. Oh yeah, she did it on Scanlan. Whoa! Are you still you? I bamf Trinket out. If you want to Polymorph him? Okay, we should go up. We should keep going. So you don't need to do that. He's the only one that can finish the sealing. Right before we go out, you mean? When we get up to the top. No, they're death knights. Can you open up the floor underneath them? It's stone. Could you open the floor and let them fall? It's a thin staircase. Three people won't be able to attack at once. So you and me go up, sneak attack, fall back and let somebody run in and take it out. Yeah? We'll take the smaller ones. Get ready to fight once we take the two out. We sneak up. Is it auto-crit if it's a sneak attack? Okay, are they surprised? Okay, 29. We're attacking the two smallest. Is it auto-crit? Oh, that's good. 30 on the first hit. Oh my god, I rolled four sixes! And a five. 29 times two is what? 58 plus eight, so 64. 66! That's the first attack. 19. 18 on the second. I immediately move to the side so he can run through. Does he move? Why isn't he moving? Does he have a helmet on? Oh no! Were they our friends? Pull the helmet off. Arkhan, pull the helmet off! Is it Gilmore? We killed the two-- No, don't do it! Arkhan, don't! Can we cast Revivify on them? Who is it? Who are they for sure? It's Kaylie and Cassandra? That is so fucked up! How did you get here? Is it really you? Can I roll an insight check and see if it's him? 21. Or you can fight with us. We're 15 feet below Vecna. He's right above us. We're going to fight him.
