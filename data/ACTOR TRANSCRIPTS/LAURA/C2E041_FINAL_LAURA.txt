He's busy this week. That's right. Does it ever stop? Help! Make it end! Yay! Oh my god! Oh my god! (screaming) (laughter) Did we get a long rest after? Can I pull out Sprinkle? You're so tough, Sprinkle. I'm going to squish his little cheeks. Oh, thank you. Okay, go right to your-- stay there. Don't drown, okay? Then I'm going to look for Beau, but she's not around, so then I'm going to go look for Nott. Where are you drinking? Oh good. I was on the deck of the ship, too. How perfect. Hey, Nott. Hi. Are you super wasted? Okay. I have a question for you. Have you-- I mean, I think you have because you said you were, like, into somebody before. Have you ever kissed a boy? Yeah? What was it like? What was it like when you kissed him? No, well-- I was asking what it was like when you kissed someone. That's all! Well, I didn't know if it counted. I was drowning. Does that count, though? Yes. Yeah. Like I wasn't dead. Yeah, I think so. I mean, it's not dead. Really? Well, I didn't know if it counted. I will. I will remember the after part of it, you know? I was a little struggling in the beginning part. I think his tusks are growing back. Just a little bit of tusk! Yeah! What was your first kiss like, though? Oh, really? With who? That's weird. You said you never forget it. I think kids do that sort of stuff a lot. Oh. Do you remember the softness of his lips? Yeah, today's pretty cool too. Oh, no. I mean, he might have a big crush on me now, you know? Oh, I don't know, you know? Yeah, I know! Really? Like, the play the games? Okay. That's right! Okay. Because I don't want to do that-- Okay. Well, all right! Have fun with your flask, okay? I'm going to go write in my journal. Okay. We should probably just rotate it. Maybe if you would roll it the other direction, it straightens it out. Did you know that? I do too. You do have memory-- What does the boatswain do again? Oh, okay. I guess I'll do the boatswain stuff? I feel like I'll be really bad at it. I'm strong, maybe I should be the carpenter! I've got no. SAM and Do you want to be the boatswain? Okay, then I'll do the carpenter. Yes! Whoa! Can I go stand over his shoulder and stare at what he's doing? Why are you having a mermaid pick fruit if she's in the water? Oh, that's really smart. It's very meaningful. Hey, Orly, I'm training to be a carpenter, did you know? Yeah, I will definitely do that, but I also want to learn how to do tattoos. Can you teach me that? I'm a really good artist, Orly. Yeah, it's a thing that you wrap around your fingers and then you go like this? I'm a really good artist, don't worry. Performance. Oh no, performance! Yeah, I'll do dexterity. Oh, 17! Do you think maybe your mermaid would want some googly eyes? Are you sure? I think it'd really make her look really good. I understand. I don't want people messing with my artistic vision, either. You and me, Orly. We're going to be fast friends. Did you say "porn of order?" Okay. Gem dust. Like a gem that's been powdered? Or like ink? Wait, are you trying to make a sparkly ink? I mean, I don't have any powdered gems, but I could probably powder some gems. Oh my god. Will you teach me how to do that if I give you some dust? Do you want to bequeath me? What if you really like me, though? That is amazing. Oh my gosh. That's a lot of jewels. Yeah, we have some. Yeah. Oh my gosh, do they shimmer, though, do look sparkly on your body, do they look shiny? (gasping) Orly, you're so charismatic. I would definitely want to learn this from you, and I probably, once I get a little more rich and I have some powdered gems, I'm going to have you do it to me. Yeah, don't get hurt, okay? Okay, what was the guy's name that was getting a tattoo? Waldok. Well, Waldok, I'll see you later. I'm going to go carpenter some stuff. I had a flashback. I'm a carpenter, Fjord. I'm learning to be a carpenter. And a really good tattoo artist. Let me see! Only because I would totally do it if they were both looking and I rolled like shit. I think there's a ship! Oh man, I don't know. I'd be okay with it, I guess. Well, it doesn't have to be a scrap like Avantika said. It could be, you know, go in and take stuff but maybe we could also give them something! I don't know, like new names or pretty drawings? Yeah, we could just make it a fun time for them. She made me question what we just did. I thought it was one thing and then her face made me think it's a whole other thing. I mean, whatever, Fjord. I guess we can do that if you want to. I don't care. I'm already down. I'm not there anymore. Oh no. I come running in. Do I need to fix a hole? I use the cantrip Mending. Probably not. One little thing goes (squeaking). Oh my gosh. Monday at nine. Whoa, Matthew Mercer! So cool! Which one is ours? Hey Fjord? You know, sometimes you can be nice to people, too. And make them think that they are friends. I'm waving at them. Hi. While he's doing that, I'm going to say I need a volunteer! In the other ship? I just want to let it known that I'm asking for a volunteer from the other crew. I need a volunteer! It can be anyone, but there should be at least one! For a special present! It's a treat! 17. Liam? Lieb. Come on! Yeah. Come sit next to me! I bust out the tattoo stuff that Orly's been teaching me. I'm going to give him a tat while all that's going on! (laughter) Where do you want it? It'll be so good. It's going to be so beautiful. Ooh, I like it! Let's get your clothes open. While everything's going on, I'm just going to spend-- It's just going to be one smiley line with two tusks sticking out of it. You've been abducted-- no, by Captain Tusktooth. Ooh! 19! Yeah, just like a smiley face, but with tusks. Just deal with it, it's going to be good. How do you know that? Oh, cool. Would you like googly eyes on your tattoo? Or would you just like smiley face? Googly eyes it is. Thank you very much. Lieb! Get back over to your ship! You're going to miss it! Go go go! Oh, nothing! I made a friend! He has been marked! Is it a one or a seven? (cheering) Go Captain Tusktooth! Captain Avantika? Would you like a tattoo? If you want any more, or if you want any of the ones you have improved, just let me know. What are you hiding? I chase after Nott. I'm following Nott. What'd you find? What'd you find? What'd you find? What was it? What are you hiding? I want to know! Oh, hi! Nott's hiding something. (gasping) Let's all walk around, walk around the whole room. Oh, that's you. That's you, Nott. Okay, hi. (gasps) Should I draw with it? Should I do something with it? What is it? Yeah! It was amazing! What is it, Caleb? What do you want a tattoo of? Yeah, no, what do you want a tattoo of, like a picture of. What is it? What? I think Molly would like that. I mean, I don't know, maybe it was really sacred to him and he would be really super offended by it. But it's fine, I'm sure. What is it? Okay, okay! It can do a thousand square feet of surface? I mean, I learn from you in a moment? (yelling) (shouting) Oh my god! This is my favorite thing in the entire universe. This is the most amazing thing in the entire universe. I won't lose it, I won't! Caleb! I promise I will not draw a penis on your head. Inanimate. But it can get us an escape from somewhere, it can-- Oh my god, this is the most amazing thing in the entire universe. I'm okay, I can live with that. It comes with enough to cover a thousand square feet of surface. So if I made a ship then it would use a lot of it. But I mean, lots of things that are little, oh my god. Just think about how many dicks that is! If it's like a five-inch dick, that's like 2000 dicks. No, you can't do that. If you want, they're non-magical items. I have a shield. Maybe because it's up-close and personal with Fjord, or it could be good for us. It's pretty cool. (laughter) "No!" Just some paint. I mean, should I try it, just to see? I'm going to paint on the floor the teeniest of dicks. Like, this big. An erect penis. Wait, I have a question, then. If I make a tree, if I draw a tree, would the tree be made of stone or would it be made out of-- would it look like a tree? I pick up the little stone penis. Who wants it? Does the serpent get released if the little orbs are spread out amongst other people or do they all have to be in one person? But doesn't she have two spheres? What if she does get the last one? Maybe, Fjord, you can, like, go seduce her or something. Then, you know, with the seduction, then (whispers) you can sneak into her office. It just seems like she's into you, you know? Yeah, I think you're fucked. If you don't fuck, you're going to get fucked. I lived-- Yeah. Does it make you uncomfortable? Do you want someone else to seduce her? I will follow. I'm going to stand at a distance looking over the rail. I'm like, you know, far away. Just looking out, looking, drawing, I'm very distracted. I think 15 feet. You need some water, Caleb? Uh. (pause) I create water in my hands. I'll keep creating it in your hands as you drink. Yeah. I've always been able to do it. Shut up. Yes. Just keep drinking. Keep going. Hi. I have magical paint! They're pretty good. Did you want me to make you something with the paint? Okay. Um, Traveler? Are you having fun on our trip? We're pirates! We stole things, but they gave something back just like you always teach, you know? Traveler, how do I make a boy like me? I don't know if I want to do it with an enchantment. Maybe? I mean, right? You'll help me out with that? You're not jealous, are you? You'll always be my number one love. I want it to be a surprise for you, I can't tell you. Okay. I'm glad you're here. It's a surprise! Oh gosh. Oh my goodness. Okay, with my magical paint-- Oh gosh. I was planning on fucking up some other things, but right now I will make a little shrine, like a little statue of the Traveler, that way I can pray to him. I want him shimmery green. What do you think? I could leave these around other places? What do you think? Okay. Okay. I've got to get to work. I can make so many of these. I will. Right, I wrote it down! It's soon, right? Yeah, in like less than a year. Yeah! I wrote down the date somewhere, I know it. Are any of those places close to your shipwreck that you know of? Natural 20. Natural 20. Natural 20 with a total of 24. I liked him. I thought he was on the other ship. I guess we were switching back and forth between ships? You're a pirate. Ta-da. It's really good. That's good. Orly the Swirly. Teach me how to do tattoos that are fancy. Make me your apprentice. Make me your-- bequeath me. Fellow carpenter! Yeah. We should probably let them go home eventually. Yeah. Maybe they should stay on the boat. Yeah. Then we will take them home eventually. Yeah. No, we didn't. It's the quartermaster. Whoa! This is precarious, you guys! I'm going to put my metal, scary mask on. Nein! That is our offering, too. It's all our offering. All hail the king. TALIESIN and I'm the Little Sapphire. I lift up my-- I'm the Little Sapphire. Ships are really cool. We like to steal things. (gasps) You draw too? Do you want to show me some of your drawings? Okay. I'm going to, definitely, every time he looks over at me, pose differently, so that he gets the best-- Does this just include harming other pirates, or stealing from them too? Got it. She's crazy all right. I thought that the entire time. Balls tits mother-bitch, I love dogs and poop. (laughter) He has beautiful hair. It's so cool, though. We were going in a completely different direction and now we're pirates! Yeah, yeah. Wow.
