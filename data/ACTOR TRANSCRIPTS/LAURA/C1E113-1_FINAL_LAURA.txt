I don't play an orc. I play Eltariel, also known as the Blade of Galadriel. I'm a super cool and I have, like, daggers, and I can kick a lot of butt. Thanks. That's exactly how I recorded it. How does he feel about elves? That was in the previous--? Yeah. Yeah, sure! Oh. Hi, my name is Arburuk. I'm the Unbreakable because people have tried but nobody was able to actually break me. I'm olog-hai, so I'm kind of big. But you know, I don't necessarily want to be a fighter, I'm just really good at it, you know? Because I'm unbreakable and all. Yeah. That was two things! You're an olog, too? What's the matter, Skak? They look a lot alike. I like gold! But I thought Barfta ruled this world. Is that gold? It's Hoshgrish. He's such a bully. Hey. You mess with Mozuu, you mess with me. Oh. Oh! Oh, well, he was, his drink was disrespected, that's all it is. Sometimes I'm talking to you, sometimes but-- Yeah. Sometimes. Because your helmet blocks the view, you know. What's he sound like? Maybe just the top of it. He's so good at math. I take a helmet off one and put it in my bag. Isn't that where Barfta lives up there? And it's on fire? Because they need to die! Ditto with my maul. Oh no! What did you get? Oh no! 14. You can call me Arby. I step in front of Skak here to try to block him from any more arrows coming. I'm a defender, you know. I know what those are! This is cool, Matt! That's not close at all! Whoa, you're a roguey rogue! He gets 3d6? Nice going, Skak! I run forward and try to do the same thing to another one. Oh shit. 18. Does he stay stunned for a turn? But if you hit a guy that's stunned, does he become unstunned? Tight. I'm going to run up and hit the guy that he hit between the legs with my maul. I hit him like a batter. That's a 15 to hit. Because he's stunned. That's a 19 to hit. No, that's wrong, that was a 17 to hit. Does it still hit? Yeah! Okay, let's see. 12 on the first hit. That was artistic. Is there another guy? Do you have something else you have to do? And there's another guy I can hit? Oh no. That might not. 11. It's because I wasn't looking at him. I was looking at the beauty on the spike over there. That is my armor class. Oh no! I'm going to use my reaction to reduce the damage. Yeah, but can I only do that once? Oh, really? Okay, I'm not going to do that just yet. I am going to use Troll's Endurance because if it's once per short rest, then it's okay, right? Yeah! I'm going to do it. Ooh! Eight plus two, so I only take one point of damage! They're so strong! Thanks! That's why I'm Unbreakable; this is why! Six! Mine hit the back; yours hit the shoulder. Yeah. Let's fuck that guy up. I'm going to try to hit him. And I'm standing next to him. Barfta. Well, I was thinking I could lead? Who's that? Is Barfta in there? And it's on fire? Barfta, is that you? I don't know if that was Barfta. Maybe we should break the door down to see who it is? I try to break it down. 17 plus eight! I get to reroll ones! Ten plus five, 15! Can we see where Barfta is in here? Does he look like he's in trouble? Does he look hurt? I'm very perceptive. 15. Okay, I try to break through the rest of the door. Oh, no. Oh, I have really good athletics! 12. Yeah, oh my god! I'm so strong! Oh, I step on him, but not to kill him, to hold him in place. Can you answer some questions for us, please? Oh, no. I scream in his face. Somebody ask him questions. Is that the truth? I start looking around the room and forget that I'm actually standing on him and I put my full weight down. Oh, does that hurt? I don't actually like the taste of-- I'll just finish stepping on him. You are so good at-- oh, counting. Yes. I'm Arb-Uruk, the Unbreakable. But you can call me Arby. Where are we going again? While he's doing that, can I walk over to Eden and say, I got burned a little in the door. Don't take my skin off, though. Oh, that's cool. I don't know if they're good or not, but I've got some eyeballs. I bring out my patch of eyeballs. Which kind did you need, because I got little eyeballs and bigger eyeballs? Oh, that's a piece of lint, you're right. What-- (yelling and laughing) I'm the chosen one! I'm the chosen! Yeah, so...no? Ow, but that made my hands hurt worse, please. All right. Oh yeah, and then I get my troll's endurance back! Do you have like fancy pins or something we could wear? Oh, you should, you should just carve it in because you're a Scar-Artist! My shoulder looks really good. You want one on your arm like I got? But we got to take a short rest though, right, while we were getting our tattoos though. Was that a short rest? What's shrak mean again? Is that a dick? Okay. A gronk is a dick? You could ride on my back. I could give you a piggyback ride. Because I think we're too big to ride this scatagorse. Yeah. I don't know. Are we too big? Well, he has the head on his helmet, so he can probably see farther than the rest of us. Here's a couple. They don't match, but that's all right. Upgrade. I'm going to take Skak and I'm going to sit him on my shoulder. You hear those people screaming in the background? SAM and And torches. Hey, something's down here. It's softer. I start stomping on it. 14. I hate ghouls. You had a torch, right, in your hand? I did mention torches, but I didn't say I pulled it out. 11. Do we all have darkvision? (sings) How are you at? What's your health at? I'm going to-- you said they're susceptible to bright light? All right. I'm going to pull out my torch and I'm going to hold it in the same hand with my maul, because I got big hands. And then I'm going to swing it. Oh, I have to light? No, I didn't light it. As a bonus action, I took it out but I didn't light it. Yeah. And then I'm going to try to hit the ones that were attacking Mozuu. (laughs) Okay. Yeah! I mean, that's what torches do. (laughter) Yeah. Ooh, that's good. That's 15. Yeah. I'm going to attack another one. 11. Yeah! Oh, I get to reroll that. Yes! 14. So there's two more of them on Mozuu? There's two more on Mozuu? I'm going to turn. I'm going to use my action surge to hit two more to try to hit them. That's 14. I've got to keep that eight. Five is... eight plus five is 12-- 13? No. 13. I've got one more attack here. Ooh, that's good. That definitely hits. 24. Ooh! 15! Yeah. You're welcome. Holy moly. Don't worry, I have a torch. Well, you said it was susceptible-- All right. All right. I guess I'm going to try to kill these things that were attacking me. Ooh! I thought that was really good, but it wasn't. It's 18. (cackles) 16! I'm going to look down and try to hit the one that's at my feet. That's a natural one. Eden! I thought I was supposed to run, but I can't run! There's ghouls! 13. You asshole. I mean, you glob! I can't really hear anything after that explosion. Does it know where home is? I think we should run away! And I start running away. As I'm running, do I see the little lost ghoul? I splat it. I want to try to splat it as I'm running. 26! 14. I keep running. Can I use-- as my bonus action, I'm going to use my second wind. They don't want to get lost like some other little ghouls out there. It's the dark lord. You should probably pick your nose. We killed them. All of them. Every last one of them. I did. Is that how many I killed? Okay. Do you think we could take them? Wait, but I'm hurt still from the ghouls. Will you help me? (laughter) Can we? Can we rest and watch them while we rest? Let's sit down for 30 minutes, around, and maybe heal a little bit, but then be ready to attack if they get up. No, Skak. Yeah. Well, my elbow's been giving me some problems lately, because I think the maul might be a little too-- I may be overextending. Oh. Well, a ghoul bit me on my knee, and a ghoul bit my ankle, and another one got up here around the shoulder, but I can't tell if it's from the scar that Skak gave me. That's good! I was down 15. You have hair? Gross. Can we run to the restroom? This is so much fun!
