I know, right? It's the song. Yeah, DM has to go first. He has to lead the group. Which one's the camera? Okay, so we're off-camera right now? Are you guys doing it together? I'm so scared. [music] Oh my god, this is so hard. I've seen clips of it but I've never seen people play it. The twins are up! Don't step on my feet, because I've got to take my flips off. I'm happy. Oh my god! I didn't know I was on! I thought I was off screen. No, it has to be easy. How do we know what's easy? Careless Whisper. You don't know Careless Whisper? It's an 80s song. We could do Gentleman. I Will Survive? No, not YMCA. 99? Easy, good! Continue. Wait, continue. Okay. I want to be red. Okay, I'm Crazy. Go over. I want to be green? What are you? I'm red? I'm red. Whatever, you're the other color. What is that? I feel like it didn't get me. This is bad. Oh my god! I'm going to die! Oh god! (cheering) Twins, baby. That was so tiring! Oh, Ashley! How do we do playback? Oh, how do we do playback? Is that a control thing? Oh. There we go. (laughter) What?! Wow, you beat us! (laughter) You should do Gentleman. Or Get Lucky. Do Daft Punk, do Get Lucky. You were great. Yes. Okay, that's pretty good, too. Oh wait, Matt, you're right there. Duck down. You're in the box. There we go. Yes, Lady Gaga! All right. Is everyone ready? I'm in it. I'm in my box. Oh no! Oh, I nailed it, I got the best!
