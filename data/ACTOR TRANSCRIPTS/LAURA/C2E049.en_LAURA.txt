That one's taken, though. No! Run away. Run while you can. And author. I mean, that's beautiful! I feel like you copied that at some point. Didn't he have to copy some sort of-- Not possible. Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they rise from the flames for the battles ahead. Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead. (singing) Can you answer the call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll! [fire burning] Deep blue robes! Lead the way. Is it the opposite direction of the hmm-hmm? Take the cart too, huh? Let's go. So hey, what the fuck? I will stay and help you. What are you so nervous about? I mean, you're just here to check on your son? That's a good cover, I guess. Was it your son, or are you even a goblin? I mean, if it's your son, that's really sad, Nott. Are you okay? I'm pretty open, too. Is that your son for real? And that's you? This is how you looked? But you're so pretty! That was here? Spin the Bottle! So was he right? Did you die? How long has it been? I feel like we can get this fixed. We can do something. Is it the people you know? Try to un-drunk Nott. Do you want some candy? I mean, it does seem like they were using him. How do you know them? Are there woods? They could go stay with my mama. They could stay at the Lavish Chateau for the time being. Bryce is there. I could send a message, see if Bryce would be okay with that. What do you think? I'm going to not be able to do this in 25 words. It's so hard! This is going to Bryce. Okay. Oh, that's good. Don't talk in full sentences. Why didn't I think of that?! Do I say stop? I could just vocally stop because Bryce will hear me. Hello. It's Jester. Two people incoming. A woman and child. Take care of them, please? We're sending money with them. This is important. I thought I had five more words! Okay. Please help. Okay. I think they're going to help! Okay. Oh, sorry about that. Yes, because I want to hear what Caleb has to say. Mm? Are you in love with me? Oh. I don't either. Teachers are cool, too. You just cared about your teacher. Good for you. Well, I figured you cared since you were checking up on her. (laughs) I totally thought she was your roommate. You were really good about that. You're welcome. Caleb. We can tell you're really scared, and that's okay, to be scared. We just don't know why. Did you die, too? How? Yeza. Would they know who you are? They're high up then, huh? Holy shit. Wait, isn't that where you want to go, Fjord? It's really bad or something? That's why you always make that face. I'm sorry, Caleb. Well, I don't think our actions define who we are all the time. Good people do bad things sometimes. Even bad people do good things. I think you're a good person. I don't think a very bad person would care that he was very bad. Are you secretly in love with me? (laughter) Like the skin? That sounds like a bad person. Would they see if we were disguised, or would they have to look for us? Do you know what I mean? Okay. It says it. It says, "His instincts are solid." Yeza, I'm assuming. "While I find this alchemist obnoxious in his simplicity--" I'm sorry, I don't believe that. "The Academy's eye for talent proves itself again." It says they want him to produce a number of batches of that liquid, the one that we stole? They wouldn't kill him then. They need him to make batches over the next 12 to 16 months. Well, she's really hot. I wonder if maybe we can break him out before he gets there? Maybe he-- it only just happened. Are we going to have to scout out and listen in on people's conversations, see if we can--? Maybe if we go with our insurance company scheme, we can say that we believe there's been fraud and he's not really dead or something. Lady-- What does that mean, antiquities? Do you think maybe they're attacking because we have the thingy? Okay. Be smart. Be so smart. It says there's other beacons. Okay, so there's more than one. "As we continue to invoke the beacon--" That means they have one. Right. "--with extremely focused energy of different spectrums and sources, divine and "arcane, the effects unleashed are ever curious and reach far beyond this laboratory. The dunamis "field often sightlessly encompassed an entire portion of the town, with locals complaining of an "ill sluggish sensation akin to being dragged down." So-- Oh my god, what if you put the dodecahedron on the tripod thing that we got, right? Then we hit it with some sort of spell. I wonder if it would amplify that spell, you know what I mean? That's true. Look at me. It's only using us if you don't like us. Do you like us, though? Ja! Fjord, they're way too powerful for us. Fjord. You can control water, which I can do too; I'm not that powerful. I'm just saying, they've probably been studying for a very long time. And if I'm not wrong they're elves. And elves live for a very long time. And they look kind of old, okay? So they're probably-- You're pretty powerful, okay? You're really strong. You're very handsome. You got some really cool spells. You can make darkness appear. It's really awesome. Yes, sir! We were. We were having a big fight. Okay. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Maybe we go up into their room at night or something and just, you know... Stabby stab. (gasp) Maybe I can send a message to him! He's such a wild mom; he's partying all the time! Do you have to do it in the morning or can you do it at night? Oh; I understand. So we head to the inn. I'm going to take everything that we've been looking at and stick in the bag so it can't be scried on or something. Yeah, same. Mm-hmm. Three rooms, I think, should do it. Three. That sounds like a very good deal. Thank you so much. Yeah, I'll pay for it. We were hoping to buy some potions while we were here. Do you know if there's a good alchemy shop or anything around? Oh no. Do you know? The alchemy shop, what was the name of it? Brenatto Apo-- Do you know if this Brenatto is around, still? Okay. Great. Did we miss the meal already today, then? All right. (puffing) Oh, really? I was joking. Honey! We're keeping an eye out for any cloaked, robed elven people. Yeah, we're trying to avoid them. I also want to find a crownsguard. You have a lovely, full beard, Matthew. (explosion) I'll split off from the group so that I'm not drawing attention. Excuse me? Yeah, I'm staying at the local inn right now. I have a friend. He's losing a little bit of his hair, and he was hoping-- I was hoping for a present I could get him, maybe a potion that would grow it? Do you know where I could find somebody that could grow hair, a potion maker or something? I don't know what kind of potions can be made. Do you know? Okay, okay. What about alchemy? Is there a local alchemist or something? No? Oh no! The building is gone; what about the person that ran the shop? That's insane. I've never seen a crick. What do they look like? Mm-hmm? How did they pop out of the ground? Did you have to fight them? You must be so brave. I mean, you look really brave. Wow! Well, all right. I guess I'll have to go to another town for a potion. Can you point me in the direction of this shop? Yeah. Okay. Hey, maybe the owner ran away or something, right? Yeah. Fingers crossed! (sighing) No, I just wanted to see if they saw him leaving the town. That's all. Yeah. A lot of soldiers hit on me. It's no big deal. Traci? Sam told me to! It feels like we're supposed to do something. Yeah. The opportunities... Yeah, we should meet up and then search. Can we call them Kryn, please? TRAVIS and That's what they actually are. I think Jeff's a really nice name. Jeff is a great name. Keep going. Wait, wait, wait. What is the possibility that your mean people can change memories? Should I try to send him a message and see if he responds? Would they know? What I do. Well, yeah, but I can say, "Don't respond if you're by anybody that, you know--" Oh, that's good. What if I do that? We only have an hour. We need to get our free food. Was it like a worm or something? Do you think the Kryn came out of the worm thing? Seven? Some of us are just hanging out. I have a question. When you Blink out-- I haven't done it very much, but I feel like it's the Ethereal Plane, right, that we go to? The Ethereal Plane? It's another plane. The Traveler told me about it. Oh. Well, I feel like we go to this other plane, right? You can walk through things on that plane, because it's not quite the same. So what if we Blinked, and then we could go through where they collapsed the tunnel? Then we could be in the tunnel and just see, you know? Then come back! Well, I don't think you can do that. Right? You can't Blink if the spot is taken up, right? I'm not trying to Dimension Door. That one scares me a bit. Yeah, that's what I mean! We Blink right here. Then we walk where the tunnel was and we go into the tunnel. Or we could just do that. This is overwhelming! Yussa's pretty powerful. I could send him a message! Yeah, we do. Yeah. If you bamf forward and there is stuff blocking the way, will you get really hurt? That's a little different. Right? The tunnel is blocked. About 200 feet in, the tunnel is blocked. I use Thaumaturgy and I'm like Whoa, that's really cool! Did you see it? There's a bunch of whispers of people going, "That's so cool!" I'm picturing like a didgeridoo. LAURA and Are you saying you want to look at them? Because Yussa said we shouldn't pull it out. Especially right now, if people are looking for it, it could be really bad. If Fjord is saying that is a bit-- then you know. Brent. Do you want me to send them a message? Your family's still there now? It's such a good name! Yeah. It's a little overwhelming. I mean, this is some serious shit. I mean, I came from Nicodranas, and everything was nice. The empire is really fucked up. Everybody went through such horrible things, and I'm really sorry for everyone. That's all. Don't worry, Nott. I already have. I'm sure there is worse to come. We'll get through it, though. Yeah. I would like nice again at some point. Yeah. Do you want to be a halfling again? We should talk to Yussa. Maybe he can help you. You're still pretty cool. I mean, the coolest goblin I've ever known. Yeah, he was wearing pretty fancy clothes and stuff. Or Veth? Or Vott? What are they sitting on? (whispering) Chair'otoa. Yeah. It's in here. Citadel! They have a citadel. That's right. It's a casino. No, that wasn't it. They were saying that they couldn't believe that Ghor Dranas was holding secrets, like that they had a whole other school of magic that we haven't discovered here. Wow. Yeah, I remember hearing about her. We could go after them. We take our cart, and we head straight toward the worst of the war. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Yeah, we can't fight an entire army. Want me to send him a message? What if I'm like Hey dude. Do you think that you're going to be able to escape or something? Oh boy. Like what? What do you want me to say? Describe him to me. Oh, that'll work. I can see what you saw in him. Is. While we're going, I'm going to try and send a message to Yeza. I'm a friend of Veth. We know you've been taken, but stay hopeful; we're looking for you. If you can, tell us where you are currently. Nott, he's alive! He said it's dark and he has to stay quiet, but thank you. We'll find him. Want me to go? Kids really like me. Thanks, Nott. Stop it. Yeah, there it is. I should go find Old Edith and I'm going to say what? There's men coming too? Okay, okay, okay. I'll go find Old Edith. Hi, Edith? Hello. You may remember me from the other night. I was outside? I'm a friend of Veth. Yes. She, of course, had to be on her way because things are hard right now, but she wanted to convey her desire for you and Lucas-- Lucas? -- Luke to find your way to Alfield. Because she doesn't think it is safe for you to be here right now. Now, Alfield is very safe and there's a wonderful person there named Bryce, who we've already sent word to because we're pretty powerful, and they'll be expecting you. She said to use the money that she gave you to head there and get a place to stay and use it for food. Buy yourself something nice, you know? As long as it takes, because it's pretty dangerous still, but we will be able to send word to you and let you know when it's safe to come home, which is good! You should get your stuff together, because tomorrow somebody will be here to escort you to the city. Yeah. Is there anything else I can do for you, Edith? Okay. Bryce will be looking for you! Oh, you're welcome. Have a wonderful day. It will only take five minutes of your time! It's got a bow on it. (sounds of distress) You're not even saying anything; you're just a pigeon! Go get your staff back! I rearrange some things on the shelves as she's doing that. 16. Thanks. (shouting) Tunnels! Yeah. I'll go look. If we can get down there. Hey, so, we were here yesterday. Shit. So we can get down to the barrier where it stops being clear? It's staying at the inn for the time being. Sure. No! Me. Yeah. Sure, and I will stay super strong as I get down there and Polymorph myself. A mole? A gopher? Maybe a gopher. You know what burrows that's bigger, is a honey badger. A honey badger. They burrow and are stronger, too. Okay, okay, okay. Where would I find that on D&D Beyond? Where are you finding it? I don't see Creatures. Oh god. Oh my gosh, wait? This is too complicated. I got lost in the-- it got lost in the nervous! Look up level eight. I need something that burrows. Oh god. Aww. Oh! I rolled pretty-- I think I-- Hold on, I've got to get back to my character. I did, I rolled pretty good. Hit the view button, Laura. Okay. Plus-- so 16! I rolled well, but my intelligence is pretty lame. Oh, like a dire badger? Okay, I want to be a dire honey badger! (snorting) I turn back and I go (giggle). Yeah. Can I talk in Polymorph? No, I'm straight up that thing. (honey badger sounds) I'm digging! That's what I'm doing! That's just-- that's what this-- (snarling) Aww! It was so good and then it went to shit! Eight. Do I add plus a d4? (panting) I can't. It is a really high level. Oh, wait. Do I get another level four at level eight? I don't know. Oh my god. I have another 4th-level spell, you guys. I can do it again! Okay. (deep breath) Don't fuck me! Gil fucked me. Okay. Well, at least that's ten. He fucked me. Yeah, right? As soon as I make a hole I'll turn back into myself and peek through. Do we still have Bless? No, that only lasts for a minute. 14. Yes. Darkvision, 60 feet; yes. Is everybody with me? You guys! I think there's a river down here! Yeah! That's how they do it so quickly or whatever. Yeah, I pull my head back out. What am I? Who do you think I am? Send some Dancing Lights in there. No, we took it. Yeah. I could draw one! Should I cast Pass Without Trace on us and stuff? I cast Pass Without Trace on all of us. God! Da da da! We are going to have to take a break or like a long rest, because I want my 4th-level spells back, you guys. (singing) Level up! You just go-- It's over-- Go back to your character page. Then you go up to level eight. Then you go to manage HP. Seven! No, you add six to your roll. HP, yeah. Holy moly! That's pretty sick. Ooh, I can infuse my weapons with poison! But it's the best feat! Are you running against him and you're going to give that?
