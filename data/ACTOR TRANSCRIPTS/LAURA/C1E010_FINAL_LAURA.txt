We just talked about them. The episode of Dread part 2 came out today-- of TableTop. It's so intense! You can watch it on Geek & Sundry. I'm not telling you anything, but it's very intense! I'm so nervous! Just right into it. Where? Awesome. You have fuzz in your hair. No you got it. It's gone. God. 20. Well, you're outside. You can go. Which one looks biggest? Does one of the ghouls look scarier than the others? He's a master zombie. Hunter's Mark him. I did it! Okay, good. Well, I don't need it because I'm going to Conjure Barrage a cone at them all once he's Hunter's Marked. While I whistle for Trinket to get his butt in. Okay, and then I Conjure Barrage. It's a 60-foot cone. I will?! Can we fly the carpet forward? Can I delay until-- what's your initiative? I'll delay until his. Can I do that? Oh, god. Get out of the middle of them. Okay. Plus your constitution. Oh really?! Oh no, I can't do anything. You won't be able to dodge it. Okay. Well, there's "no" really anybody else, so I'm going to... There's "no" really anybody else-- I can shoot through my fire thing, right? Should I save it? Oh, natural 20! (all cheer) 21. Hit him. Oh, actually, 23. I forgot I had bracers on. Good to know! 21! What do I do for a critical, then? Okay. Oh, that's not that good. 15 for the first one. And 12 for the second one. And Hunter's Mark on both! That was definitely a six. That was a six! Seven, then, for Hunter's Mark. Can we land? Tiberius? Are you alive? I go look at the treasure chest. I thought you checked for traps. Awesome. Good thing you didn't get there in time, Scanlan. Okay, cool. What's reflex? Is that dexterity? 30. As a twin of a rogue... Can I have your thingy Your eraser thingy? Oh, thanks. Oh no. Did I destroy the loot? Aw, come on! I'll take it to Grog, because I figure he'll probably be able to use it. I don't know if it's magic or anything, Grog, so you might want to have Tiberius have a look at it. Pass that piece of paper over here. I'm just going to keep this with the party gold. Plus one diamond to the treasury. Did you turn it back into coal? Whoa, sparkles! Well, he's hurt. Can I perception check around the cave? Oh no, come on! Don't! (all laugh) I'm getting real tired of your shit. I rolled 22 on perception, by the way. 22. Yes, yes, yes! (quietly) I think maybe... We should not be hanging out in this room right now. Can I try to get a better look at what I saw? It's a big ray of death. I don't know. Ugh! Ugh, double 20s on the table. Ten. What should we do? Command us. Do you want us to stay? We've never run! Just leaving me? You're leaving me behind? (groaning) Can it fit us? We jump onto the carpet! He probably does. That was good, because I was going to let it go. Oh yeah. Does it even matter? Oh, that's good! You know nothing here. Don't spend all your sorcerer's points! It's not my turn yet! Tell him to go! Trinket! Run! I jump off the carpet, climb on Trinket, and we take off! Can you go? Oh, you're a shark. Damn it! Wonder how far this thing can fly. Are we all on the boat, or are some people still on the carpet? We didn't all fit in the boat! That's why we didn't all take the boat originally. You're the only one still on the carpet, then. How long is that chain on the axe? I don't know. Oh no! Our whole party! 11. I rolled an 11. Trinket is immune to being scared. It doesn't matter, because I'm scared. Get it Grog, get it! Does that cancel out our fear? How high are the ceilings? Can you pillars it down into the water? There should be a dot on one side. Don't be lower. Hunter's Mark! And I'm going to attack him twice! Because I'm original. 16. And 28. Oh, so I've got to roll a couple more times? They both hit. They're both high. 26 for those two. Plus Hunter's Mark. Oh, wait! No, 30 for those two. And 9 for Hunter's Mark. Ew. Put it in a little vial. Keep it for later. Not good. What was it? Can we loot him? (all laugh) We can make wind. We have a Grog. Should we make our way to the little island? All the way up and over? Oh yeah, it's right on the edge. The only thing is, I'm afraid that if we keep using up all our spells, then we won't be able to take down the big baddie if we come to him. Oh, okay. So should we make our way to this cave? How close are we to the cave? Are we still really far away? I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us right now. Can we look around the entrance and see if anything dangerous looks like it's around? I'm looking up on the ceiling. Okay. Can we maybe try to look in? Should we just light it up, see what's in there? Hey, Tiberius? I shoot the arrow. Oh wait, wrong eye. Right, right. This doesn't seem very good. Oh, you didn't add ten to your stealth. Pass Without a Trace. Well, I already-- yeah. We've got to try to hide a little bit. Just get some light in there. Can you put Daylight in there? Can you see if it's evil? I don't think we should go in there. But she'll be popping up into the wisps. I think just wall it up. Can we see anything sparkling? Can we look in and see if there's anything that looks useful? Right, Lady Kima? No, because the island's way over back here. I think we rest up before we do that. Can you wall it up? All right. We'll all be ready to attack on the outside. So what are you doing, Keyleth? Are you staying in there? Wait, what did you see, Keyleth? What was it? Was there anything in there? Were there creatures? Oh, I've heard of gricks. They're really fast. Yeah, they slither. I think it would probably go to the Abyss or something. I wonder, do they attack things? They seemed really fast, right? Percy can you make a bomb? Can you throw the bomb in there and they would all maybe attack it, and maybe it would blow them up? Just throw it from outside and see what happens. We are really close to it. Tiberius, was that really necessary? Shh! We already have a bomb. Just throw it in, they attack it, we close them up. Throw a bomb, they attack it, then you can throw a fireball at the same time. We just have to get them in a cluster. Just throw it! We just need to throw it into the cave. Is it so hard to just throw a freaking bomb into a cave? A stealth check. And you have Pass Without a Trace. What's the point of the bomb? Why not just do that? You're right, it will, yeah. And really loud. Take a couple steps in, and perception. 24. Is there anything that can come through the portal? What's all this purple stuff? Okay, Tiberius. Is it safe to be near it? I got him, guys, I got him. You were rather loud. I'm afraid things might be drawn to this beach from that explosion. Maybe it would be good to block it off. I like it. No, but can't you use your rock-changing ability and squish all the rocks down and close the cave off? Yeah. Keep going, Grog. You'll get there. So you know what he looks like? Are those Cheez-Its you're eating right there? Okay. Maybe you can envision the horn? I like it. While she's doing that, can I use my primeval awareness and see if there's anything undead or aberrations or things that are around us that are seeming more active? In the center. So. Wait. I'm sensing... would that help you to know that K'Varn is an aberration? I'm sensing a really strong energy of an aberration in the middle of town. And that's something that would've come out of this portal. Right, Clarota? Yeah, yes, please. There's things happening. That's so sweet! Aw, you guys! I still haven't ordered mine. I need to get my hoodie. It's going to be tight. Don't do that. No, we haven't rested. What are you digging there, Grog? Can we hear any kind of movement coming from the other island? Does it seem like they heard those explosions? Are we safe here? Okay. He's doing a camouflage-y thing, and she can make it look like nothing's on the-- Hide? Yeah. He's probably just playing with us right now, waiting for us to get there. Oh no! Keyleth! Language. What did you see? (gasps) You said there is something caging the Elder Brain right? So there's something connected to the top of the temple that's caging the Elder Brain? Is it possible to maybe collapse the top of the temple from far away, and release the Elder Brain from its cage and then Clarota, your brethren could fight the beholder instead of us? (laughs) Oh, the thing on the front of the Monster Manual. That's all you could have said. I mean, we've killed a dragon. Oh. The horn is the goal. Exactly! We free the Elder Brain, they attack it. We don't have to fight it ourselves. So if we take out the beams-- It might age you. It might do something. But does anybody have an aging spell? Something that causes things to disintegrate things? Maybe we could rust the metal as well? It might be a form changer, because the king swallowed a vial and it made him strong. He's got vials of acid in his Bag of Holding. Let's break the temple. Clarota? Clarota, you're going to cramp your face if you do that. Right. Can beholders fly? They can. Okay. What can't they do? So they're really very fleshy and weak, but he put armor on himself. So now he's extra strong. Reconnaissance! What is that? So is it possible to try to get her help before we do this? Or is it something that you have to do on the spot? So if we attempt it, then she can intervene? She can be on our side? Once we know what we're doing. I feel like we should go for the top. We have to take out the metal thingy. I think we destroy the structure. We don't have any kind of corruption spell that ages things? What if we hit it with Dispel Magic, maybe get your goddess's aid-- hit it with Dispel Magic, hit it with corruption, rust the shit, and then it falls! Like, extra bad? We don't even know what it does yet. We can't get closer. What if we fly in over the top with the carpet in stealth, put the camouflage on the carpet so they don't see it. Fly in over the top. Stealth in, spy, get an idea of-- Yeah, see what kind of magic is being held on top of it. We were trying to find clues so that maybe scrying would be helpful, which it was. Okay, here's another option Dimension Door. What if you go and hug one of the beams and Dimension Door the beam out? You can't cast a portal on the door and make it fall? Not like Portal? Those are just more things to fight. No, stealthy stealth. Just to make sure it's not crawling with baddies. Yeah. But I could cast Pass Without a Trace so everybody gets +10 to their stealth rolls. Trinket. How about Kima and Clarota? Clarota should go with us. Can Clarota be on the carpet, then? Yeah, Clarota come with us. Clarota, I'm sure we've asked this before and I wasn't here because I missed a part of a thing? What about your hat? What does it do? Can you make more of them? All right. Try to stealth it. Are we camouflaging the carpet? And we're stealthing? Ahead? Being sneaky. I rolled a natural 20 on stealth. Can we check out the thing in the air? That was it. Clarota, will those trees attack us? Are they living and attack-y? Wandering spores?! I'm picturing a big yellow thing with little legs. Is that what it is? Well, that's lovely. Thank you for your help. Spiny. Oh, you know what, Grog, I hate to tell you this-- Is it our old stealth check? Can I use my flying stealth check? Damn it. 31. Plus ten. Pass Without a Trace. These buildings are sad. Oh, should we hide? Can we try to hide? Oh, yeah. Can I do insight and see if it seems like a bad guy? I know. I'm just checking to see if he's a misunderstood guy. That's 17. Yeah, can we move into the shadows? We know where you are. 20 shirts! That's it. Me and Pike bought hoodies. I bought a hoodie. We could all be hoodie Twinkies. He's taking his time. Oh no, really? Whoa! We're 14 shirts away! Yes, very much. That's so awesome. Oh my gosh. You guys are awesome. Hell elf. Ooh. That's so cool. Seriously? That's so cool! We'll be able to see it. All of us are kind of obsessed about checking out the hashtag. Huzzah! Happy Birthday! If you say so. Yeah, oh my gosh. He made a bear statue?! Yeah, that's him. What, dude! Both of you, calm down. Hold your peace. For a thousand bucks, yeah. Now there's so much pressure. (all laugh) Eat lightsaber, jerk. There. Yeah. But now he's in love. You're in a very fabulous purple coat right now. Danke schön. Did I say that right? Oh, okay. They have the coolest stuff. Yeah, we have a bunch of posters at our house. That would be awesome. Thank you! I'm tweeting your cake right now! You're so amazing. That's-- yeah. He did. So amazing! How tall are you, Travis? I saw that one. Oh, someone's asking about Keyleth's child murder. Can you see our heads now? Can we talk about Keyleth's child murdering? This was sad. Big golden scissors, but we put them in our pocket and forgot that we had them. But there was one kid left. I thought you grabbed the kid's waist and he got pulled toward the thing, but the chain was still around his neck. If Trinket survives for 12 months. Yeah, our previous name. I think it's awesome. Some people that are maybe druid and-- I saw, what color is Trinket and what color is his armor? He's brown, and he's got silver armor. Oh, that makes sense. I'm neutral good. I don't think you're chaotic. No, that was definitely a character thing. Now we're all nice and cozy. Wait a sec. "Hey, guys, love the stream." I can't read this fast. It's too much. You can still trust Vex after Dread. I'm not the same girl. Whole different character. Yeah, we thought that would be fun. Yes. MATT AND You were a child actor, too. (gasps) I just saw one that said, "Laura, would you like "a giant Trinket plushie to sit at the table with me?" And yes. I would. Dude, that would be amazing. These guys. Who's the youngest? Marisha? Oh, my old brother. Don't send us shit. We are twins! What, what! No, I'm not. Sorry, guys. Adorable. We did a job as extras together on a set. We sat for 8 hours at the same table, and we couldn't talk to each other because we weren't allowed to make noise. Yeah, we thought we were so cool. And then just started hanging out in the same circles, and that was that. Yes, like literally the moment Pike was in the game. Donatello is my favorite Ninja Turtle. Is that the Resident Evil we worked on together? Oh, okay. I did that, too. Yeah! MATT AND Aw, I saw, how did me and Trinket become friends? Okay, it's kind of a long story. Me and Trinket. I sent this short story to Matt-- what was it, a year ago? I just wanted him to know why Trinket was so special to me. It's such a dorky thing. It was a long thing. And it was all about, shortly after me and my brother left our family of the elves and we were setting off on our own and he was off in the city and I was making camp outside of town, these people came into the camp and basically I trusted them too much, they kidnapped me and brought me back to their camp. And they were poachers on the black market. And I was in a cage and I could hear a large creature in pain, and through my own wiles I got out of the cage, took out the two hunters, and I went to see what animal it was, and it was a giant bear in a lot of pain. Unfortunately, it had been cut open from the middle, they had been harvesting the bear but they hadn't killed it, and it was really sad, so I felt terrible for it, and I put it out of its misery and felt really bad about it. And then I heard off to the side, a small animal make noise, and I realized it was its cub. So I took the cub and I felt really horrible, and that was also my first time I'd ever killed any people, as well, so Trinket was very special to me because I wanted to protect him and not let him experience that again. I didn't eat the cub! I saved the cub! And I have never even told anybody about that. I never told Vax about that, or anything. So Trinket was mine. Yeah. Ooh, she'd be pretty great. Carrot Top, anybody? Oh, yeah. I'm seeing that "expect a crochet Trinket." I appreciate that. Thank you. Barack Obama! TRAVIS AND Wil Wheaton. Tom Hiddleston. So many! There is?! There's a me emote? We're talking to Vin Diesel. Who is that? Actually, no, you know what, I've had conversations with Troy about it-- I don't think he'd be opposed to joining the game. Yeah, he seemed very interested when he brought it up. I think because me and Travis were so excited about it-- It grew on him. Yeah. Matt Oswalt, that would be such a fun guest! What? That just seems messed up. Ooh, what are Lady Kima's and Clarota's alignments? Can we know that? What are Lady Kima's and Clarota's alignments? We don't know that. You also collected lots of dried poo and put it in the Bag of Holding. Yeah, the rage-looting. (gasps) We were going through this thing. There were traps everywhere-- electrical traps, everywhere. And all of us were being really cautious, and Grog hits Trinket on the butt with the blunt of his axe and sends Trinket running through the thing. And he just hit every trap on the way through and almost died. He guested before we had the show. He came in our game. You weren't there. That was probably a night you were gone somewhere. That's what I want to be if I die. I want to roll as a tiefling. Somebody did do that. Kit's really talented. The illusionary giant weird nipple? This makes me uncomfortable. It's geekandsundry.com/shows/critical-role. No. I think his intelligence is a four, so he's two points lower than you. Dude, they were like eight hours. Why? I know, that seems a bit much for you guys. We used to play for eight hours! There was one time, for a 1, that it was a really funny bad fail, and that was when we were fighting the Dread Emperor. And Scanlan was trying to get the final blow, and he rolled a one. And the Dread Emperor literally side-stepped him and Scanlan fell out of a window. We were dying. "Go, Scanlan!" It was really amazing. A beholder. Yeah, you did look excited. I think you were excited that you thought it might be a beholder, and then it was. Oh, that's a good question. Yeah! We saved you. Yeah, I would like to know. (laughs) (fake cries) It was so sad. All of us are crying. It was terrible. You were on your way out the door, and then we talked you into staying for a little longer because we were getting into the fight and you were like, "Okay, I'll stay." And then she died. Oh, what's our-- ooh, that's a tough one. That's so hard. I love everyone. Really? Oh. Trinket is the bomb. Yeah, everybody's great. I don't have as much fun playing if Sam's not there because Scanlan is such a funny, fun character, and your ideas for things. Even right from where we first started playing, the things that you came up with to-- Yeah! Burt Reynolds. All these different things that you would do, it's just so different. And a fake mustache. Oh my god, you guys are going to love him. Gilmore's Glorious Goods. No, not since the show started. Literally pine cones. It was street. Yeah, you should. I've told you the last five games to get rid of your dice. Because that's what I do. If I roll with a-- I am fickle. If I roll a one, it's gone for the game. I won't roll it again. But if it rolls bad more than three times, it's out. It's gone. There is a dice graveyard, and I spent a lot of money on these really beautiful amethyst dice. I should! That's true. But they're beautiful. No, because some people roll bad. Some dice roll bad. It is the dice! I'm a Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff. (gasps) Slytherin. No, he's not a Hufflepuff. He's a Slytherin. What are you? We've got a lot of Slytherins in our group. I'm going to make a Liam plushie. It's a medicine roll over and over and over again. I know. No. Because we just went straight for it. Oh, yeah. I know, we haven't been back. Ooh! Which Game of Thrones house do we belong to? Stark. (gasps) I told everybody my Trinket story. Oh, when they said it was satanic and stuff? No. Oh, Grog and Kima. Oh, Greg did it. Oh, with a little porty emote. That's cute. Thanks, Greg Miller. That was so awesome. Was that during the game? Oh, that was before the show. That was a good one. Yeah, and we had to bust you out. That, and Percy was an awesome lawyer. That's a good question, Matt. I just saw, if we all die or if some of us die, do we have to roll in at a level one, or do we start at a higher level? On top of losing a character. Do we play any other tabletop games? I just did that show with Wil. Titansgrave, which is a different tabletop RPG, and it's really fun. I was worried even when we were figuring out the setup of the tables, how it was going to work, that being far away from each other was going to screw things up, but it's just like when we were playing at our house across the table from each other. We're also only playing for three hours, as opposed to eight. I saw a thing asking what was it like shooting the opening credits. (all laugh) Being in costume for it and everything. Which is really funny, because we did not plan on being in costume. Like a bracer or carry a weapon. We all showed up and were like, "oh, this is cool! Let's put this on!" Oh, nice! Congratulations. Didn't you have one made? (gasps) That's right, it did! It saved her life. Dude, Scott! I was just talking to Amanda Wyatt today about your concert the other night, and I wish I would have been there. Different one? Like a pet? I dream about our characters. Isn't that crazy! Oh, I pictured Gilmore with black hair. Oh, I like that! I pictured him with black, slicked-back, greasy hair in a ponytail. Isn't that crazy that it's instantly Clarota and it's instantly Kima? It's not Matt anymore, as soon as it's that character. It makes us so happy. Awesome. I save so many pictures to my phone. I have no reason for it, but I scroll through it when I'm by myself. Yeah, you find a lot of good stuff. Liam, man, you find so much on the internet. A different class? Yeah. I think I definitely, if I have to re-roll, which I don't ever want to have to do, but I would want to be a tiefling. I know! I also like being a human. Oh, that's true. You're so good at dwarves. I love it! Or hanging with your friends. You don't have to drink. And even if it's not people you know very well. If you find people that like D&D-- so many people that we've seen online, and some of our friends, don't have D&D groups, and they find a place to go and play D&D and meet those people. Honestly, I didn't know you very well, I didn't know Orion very well, when we started, and now all of us are best friends. It creates that. I know, we see each other more than almost anybody else in our lives. We've got to get going. Grog has a session in the morning. We love you, Critters!
