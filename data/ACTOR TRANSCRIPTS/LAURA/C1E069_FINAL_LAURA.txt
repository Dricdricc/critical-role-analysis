Whoa! No, it's Gone in Sixty Seconds. Ashley, do you want this? That's pretty sick. (laughter) In a horror. 630am. Yes, this is exciting! Her face was ripped off, but when her body was discovered, she was wearing one of these How Do You Want to Do This? hoodies. These sweatshirts that have been available before and then we took them away. But guess what, guys? They're back! For two weeks of preorder, you can get these comfy, cozy hoodies. There's other things in the store too, like our beautiful mug that I don't have on the table today that Ashley used in Blindspot! You'll be wearing it all the time. Oh no. We'll deal with him later. (tearfully) Grog? Can you pick him up? Percy? Do we sense him? Is Orthax around? Can you sense evil? How do we destroy him? I will, I guess. So we drop it in acid again? No! How do we get him to Whitestone? Somewhere with a tree. We have the stone. Potentially. I could try putting Percy in the necklace and-- Yes. So we rest and then we go to Whitestone in the morning. I still bring Trinket out of the necklace, and I cast Cure Wounds on him. Nine whole points. Plus five. Animus? Can I read the names? Just rip everything out of my hands. Go for it. Have you seen her messing with that, Kynan? Do we have an arcane caster? Is that you? Scanlan? We could bring the rakshasa through. What do we know about these healing spells? Well, what we need to do to Percy. How long do we have? To get him to someone? I don't, either. Can we have taken a short rest to heal a bit before we do anything? And I'm going to ride my broom there so I don't get any damage walking on the glass. Is it dark in there? Could I-- I set fire to the tip of an arrow and shoot it using Oracle Shot into the cave. That was cool. It's a fucking tunnel. There's maybe something in there. (tearfully) I don't know what we're doing. I don't know what purpose it serves. Can I check for anything that looks out of place, any danger or anything? Traps, if you will. Terrible investigation.11. It seems so safe. Sure. 20. Are there tracks at all in the cave? I feel like they've already been in here, and she took what she found. Following the path that we see her footsteps in. Anything that looks like a teleportation circle or anything? (sighs) Natural one. Okay. This is what Ripley took. This is where she found the scroll. (tearfully) Let's go back. Super restful, just the most restful sleep. Yes. I'll fly over to them. Yeah, but they might not understand what it means. I'll fly over to them and tell them, what, they can go? Yeah, but there wasn't a time limit on that. I'll fly up to the airship. We're going to find another way back home. You can take the airship back to Ank'Harel if you want. Somewhere with... clerics. I don't know. Of course. Thank you. Oh shit. I go back. (laughter) Oh, my wallet! No, but I go back up and I say to Captain Damon Are you willing to join a fight? Those dragons destroyed our home. We could use an airship in the fight against them. You wouldn't be fighting alone. Of course. There's a lot of gold there. A lot of riches. I've been rolling so well tonight. 20? (quietly) Oh shit. Should I? (sighs) Do you know where Whitestone is? It's in the mountains. I'm trusting you with that location. Thank you. You, as well. We're getting married. It's wonderful. They're heading to Whitestone. We did. It is. Didn't you ever have blanket forts, Grog? We'll show you how it's done. Thank you, you already said it. You said it's mine. It's mine. I take one of the blankets, and I cover up Percy. We're normal again. (sing-song) Morning comes. Can we Tree Stride, Keyleth? Can we go? I give him some water. You should get up. We're leaving. Go to tree. Go to Sun Tree. Do we see anyone around? We get Pike. We go to Pike. What? Someone should get Cassandra. Is she building a temple here? Can we try the earrings? Does Pike have her earring? Pike, can you hear us? Where are you, darling? (tearfully) We're coming to find you. We bring him inside. Pike, can you do something? Can you help him? Does Resurrection just bring him back? Okay, so we could do that. What does Resurrection do? I bring out the best diamond I have. I got a whole 40-pound bag of gems. That's terrible, Scanlan! Yeah. I've got a thousand-dollar diamond. It's actually listed in my items. A thousand-gold diamond. Is it Orthax? Is there a way to find out what it is that's blocking it? How do we draw him out? We can pull Orthax through the gate. We need to destroy the gun. Can you reach out? Can you do that? Yeah! What if we brought the gun in front of the circle? It cancels out the magic of it. Or just bring in there. I don't know. We could try. Can I reach forward and look in Percy's coat for that condensed whitestone that he carries? Sure. 25. Nothing else? He says it's supposed to amplify magic. Right? So I put it on his chest. (shakily) I say Percy, I don't know if you can hear me, but that day in Syngorn was one of the best moments of my life. And not because of what you think. It wasn't because of my father or the title. It was because of Whitestone. It was because of you. You allowed me to be a part of the thing that you hold dearest. And I was so proud. But I don't want to be here if you're not. Whitestone still needs you, darling. I still need you here. And I lean down and I kiss him, and I say, I should have told you it's yours. Natural 20! Can you sing? Can you sing, Pike, like you did for that little boy? Percy joined you then. Divine intervention? (laughs) Pike! Taliesin, get your butt in here! Percy? I feel like we need to take a break. Can we take our break? I'm going to throw up. Good job, Ashley! Welcome back. Oh shit. Can you see? Are his glasses broken? We did! Everything's fine, dear. Who says we didn't? A day. Is he gone? What do we have to show them? Oh shit, I haven't even looked at the cloak. I tucked it away. I pull out the cloak. So you could do an additional 6d6 lightning damage? Grog in a cloak? The locket. What about Keyleth? Your armor? Yeah, but Grog doesn't need that. Wait, I have an old music box. Can you look at it and see if it's magical? Just a music box? Lovely. It's an instructional guide? Are there any illustrations? He spent 50 gold on it. Thank you. A letter? What is it? Is he proposing to you? (laughter) Wow. Motherfucker, that's cool. You're becoming a wonderful leader, Keyleth. Let me see. Can't tell. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't like what he wrote. Natural 20! I think it's fine, Keyleth. I think he perhaps bared his heart a little too much. Maybe he said things he thought better of. Speaking of, I did have Captain Damon bring his airship here. Is that stupid? Yes. We should sleep. You should. You look very tired. Jetlag, man. It'll get you. I don't know what to do. How about some coffee, then? I give Pike a huge hug. Why doesn't Pike look at him now? Are you tapped, Pike? He was traveling with Ripley, Pike. He was traveling with Ripley. Oh no. And Percy's dead again. My bad, sorry. Because you are all powerful and you can do that. Oh no! They were expensive! Oh, Pike! Seriously? Pike, you're such a badass! Oh no, Pike! I know, right? Can I check out that letter that I found on Percy's-- Good night. Oh, this? Oh. Well, I suppose I'm a horrible person, so you might as well be, too. This? It's a letter. It's a goodbye letter from Percy to us. I feel like it's a bit of an invasion. I probably shouldn't have done that. Well, I know. I was searching for something important. I just realized I still had it, is all. What do you guys think? Should I pretend I didn't read it? Should I pretend I didn't take it? No, it's just folded. All right. Technically, we should all write these letters. Grog, you can draw some pictures for us. You better hope she doesn't move. Did it wake her up? We should head back to the castle. No. I sneak into Percy's room. (sings) Shit, why? I'm sorry! SAM and 29. I'm not going to shove it in his butt, all right? Can I try to reach under and get it into the pocket in the coat? Sleight of hand? Seven plus 15 is-- I tell him I'm glad you're back. And I leave the room. Oh, so this is yours. Here, I don't need it any more. (laughter) The war room down by the orb? Should we have this downstairs, then? I want to insight. I don't care. 27. Don't you think? Ashley, I think we should go down to the orb. Ashley, come home. I would feel more comfortable downstairs. We talked about this. Wow. It's when he showed up and he's like-- you said something about transporting somewhere-- Hey, thanks, Loot Crate. Thanks, Ashley!
