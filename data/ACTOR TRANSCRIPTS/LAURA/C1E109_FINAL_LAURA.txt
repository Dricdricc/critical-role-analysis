All right. Yeah, thank you guys. They're really great. Let me see those trammels. Who has the trammels? I just want to look at them. All of them. That's it. I just want to hold them, really. Yeah, I'm cradling them, Grog. Can I tell which one is which god? All right, cool, I'm going to hold on to the Pelor one. Pass them back. Yeah. I don't know if anybody else wants to hold one. Yeah, he was only big fighting the bulette. So you want us to leave? Outside the mansion? You're out the mansion now? Have fun, you two! We're really sorry for everything, Scanlan. You know we love you. No. I'm married. That would be awkward. Yeah, seriously. I'm so amazed with both you and Percy. You really pulled through, and we would be lost without both of you. Yeah, that fight could've gone terribly, and we pulled through as a team. That was a great song, Scanlan. You have four choices! You want to what?! I walk up and I palm Scanlan's forehead and slam him to the ground. What the fuck are you doing? I'm going to feel his forehead. Does he feel warm? Scanlan, I don't blame you. I don't. This seems to be coming out of nowhere, and he's married to me, and I will cut you! How much of an age difference? I'm going to look into his eyes. Are his eyes dilated? I'm going to sit directly between Percy and Scanlan for all of this conversation. I have a 23 passive perception, Scanlan. What? I grab his fingers and start to bend them backwards. I whisper in his ear do you want to keep playing your fucking lute or not? Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with you? How long have you felt this way? Because this is very fucking strange, Scanlan. Oh yeah. Is he still in the same place? Well, shove your head out the door. He hasn't moved at all? Where would that move him towards? Solid. Yeah. Do Allura and Gilmore and Kima and everyone, do they know what's going on? Have we sent word? It'll be fine! Yeah. I'm in the bed, you motherfucker! We're married! Scanlan Shorthalt, tell me now why I shouldn't feed you to Trinket. Would we know that something is wrong? What am I making? Insight. Okay. Fucking A. It's a 12, but I rolled a three. All I have is Lesser Restoration. Unless you're fucking with me, I'm going to try Lesser Restoration. Here's the thing, darling. If something is wrong with him, and this is so out of character I'm afraid something is wrong with him-- not that you're not completely desirable-- But he needs a good night's sleep and I'm afraid he won't get it in this. I'm going to try Lesser Restoration on him. I'm not sure if it'll work. In case it's not, don't do that anymore. Well, fuck. I got nothing. Scanlan! Seriously, this is not acceptable. Go to bed! If we let you out of this cage, will you go to bed? I'm going to send Trinket to your room with you, and he's going to sleep on top of you so that you will go to sleep. Yeah, let's do that. Why? Why did you do it? Oh, hey. So, Vasselheim? Oh god. What if Vasselheim is a show of power? They were only going to wait for us a couple of days, and then they were going to head back. I think the destruction of the world may be more important than 500 gold. (shocked noises) Or Melora's tree maybe? (laughter and applause) He's painting it on the door? The guy in the city is? That's the Vecna symbol, right? Fuck. Should we go up and talk to that guy? You there. Dreams? What dreams? This symbol will not protect you. Because I know his followers. They won't have mercy. They'll gouge out eyes, remove your hand, and make you one of them. Okay. Hold on. 17? Yes. We'll do our best. That's what we're here for. Dear god, I hope that works. I don't think they noticed you, Grog. Is he already gone? Maybe it's best to not let people give him power, because the more people believe in him, the stronger of a god he becomes. Could you maybe make the sun reappear? Is it like Ghostbusters? Yeah. Can you miracle more? Maybe above the Sarenrae temple. Let's do it at the temple of Sarenrae or the temple of Pelor. (whispering) We made them! Like, so much. He's listening right now. Look, I'm sure you've realized by this point that Vecna has ascended to godhood. He's not reached his full power yet. The only way it will happen is if he claims a great use of power. He's on his way here. The more followers he has, the more power he has. Yeah. So yeah, he's got this ability. Allura, does the sky look like this in Emon? We have the knowledge that we can't take him by surprise. He sees everything. Yes! So he can't hear us right now? (sighs) It feels so good! Oh, good call. Wait, you'll make what? I didn't hear it! Very true. There is Critical Role live Vox Machina t-shirts. Silted Veil and the Crypts of Tholmura? And one is icy valley, the other one is, what, zombie dwarves? Okay. Yeah! We're mostly really good at that. Fuck! Come on! Shit! Fucked up because it's Trinket. It's a Trinket cape. Yeah, but thank you. It's gorgeous. Yeah, it's warm. I'm already very warm. No, I think it was to Liam. Vord, does this need to be attuned? (laughter) It's okay. I'm going to sit down. Keep talking. I'm going to try to attune while that's happening. Well, we can't tell you! You do that. I'm un-attuning the Bracers of Archery in order to attune to this ring. Do you have a card that I can see? I want that paper! And what's the name of it, exactly? Dracarys! Has it been long enough that it's attuned? I don't want to talk about it for a little more time. Maybe we should just give up. No, you know what? Vecna's right. I'm really worried about our family. We should all split up and go be with our families right now. Maybe you should! Maybe we will! Let's do it. No! Okay, seriously, that's too far. It's too far, don't. I don't like it. It looks fucking good. It looks great, Grog. Okay. Fuck Vecna; we're not for Vecna. Yeah. I know! Change of heart. So we have two options, right? What were you saying, Scanlan? The Stilted Bale? So wait, we're going there why? Okay, so we choose between those two as our strike place? Maybe it's best that we don't let anyone else know where we're going. Yeah, because that way it'll all be a surprise. Did he? I don't know what he heard. I don't know how often he listens to us, I don't know any of that. Does he have to actively listen, or is it a passive thing? I mean that's the thing, I mean he's building an army and trying to take over the world. I can't imagine he's listening to us all the time. Yeah but him. He's doing things. Like he's got shit to do. Do we know what kind of creatures are in the icy veil? Could there be ice giants there? Would Vecna want ice giants? Pike! Are you willing to leave the temple now? You aren't abandoning them. Well, okay, but if you're astral projecting, aren't you chilling in one room here, not really communicating, anyway? 13. Oh no! But this can't be the only thing that determines if she's an astral projection or if she comes with us? Will everything work like normal if she's astral projection? Yeah, we'll totally jaeger her if she's okay with it. Okay, that's very true. But if she's an astral projection, can she still use the champion's blessing that she got from Sarenrae and stuff? Motherfuck. How do you know that? Do you know what kind of magic it is that keeps him from holding us? Just wondering. You said there were kinds, but I want to make sure. That's good. Just making sure. Because I thought that was what it was. I just wanted to double-check. Give Gilmore a hug for us, will you? See what? Yeah? Well, I'm glad. I think they're taking care of the forces. We're taking care of the god. So he's basically wanting to raise a giant zombie titan full of zombie cannibal dwarves, and then they'll poo them out to fight other people. Here's the thing, are we relying on Grog to stab these trammels through Vecna? It takes three separate attacks, I'm assuming, right? Or would it be attack, attack, attack? (laughter) Okay, but it would be one of those situations where you'd have to attack and then draw another one, and then attack, right? Already, before we even do that. We do. We're saying we don't have time to make a scroll spell, scroll scroll, spell scroll. But it is a melee weapon? I'm going to pass the Pelor trammel back to you. And it's not concentration, right, so you can also cast Death Ward? And Death Ward lasts for eight hours? Sure. Is it yours? He just hit snooze, you guys. It was all a dream! What is it? Whoa! Okay. So everybody take one superior, right? Everybody gets one and there's one extra? I'm going to mark down that Pike has one. Scanlan's super important. I know you're very fine and you're very capable. Yeah. Okay. We are. Very. How close? Oh shit. I mean, if he's already passed by the crypts, is there any reason to go there? I don't understand. You want us to go fight Vecna right now? Do it. Do it right now. TALIESIN and Are you zoning in on the city, or are you zoning in on Vecna? Can you scry on that death knight guy that was next to her? We didn't kill him. We did not kill him. We did not hit him! We did not! (laughter) Hey, Keyleth? While we're flying through the air, is it possible for you to give us a nice inspiring speech? We're making a what, an intelligence check? Is this an intelligence? 21. Does it look like a walking path? A very large walking path? Do we see anything in the air, any of those shadow creatures? Or is it just our wyvern riders? Natural 20! Is the sinkhole in the direction of the city that's moving right now? (shouting) That's the fucking titan! It's the titan full of dwarf bodies! I just realized that! (laughter) Shit! I thought it was just a really big giant, and then I remembered it was a titan. At least 600 feet tall. What did you say? How are we going to fucking fight something that's 600 feet tall? Maybe? We got to get inside of it. Are we on J'mon Sa Ord's back? Trinket's in the necklace for this part. It could be! That one's dead! Does that mean you can beat him up from the inside? Yeah! Do a what? I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us. It's not going to make any difference, but I'm going to do it. That would be one powerful fucking spell. Pike, how strong are you feeling right now? You got it. You're a monster! I think we should dive into one of the beehive tunnels and stealth in. I think we should still be stealth mode. J'mon can drop us off. J'mon, you distract all of the city with all of your wyvern riders, as well, and we'll come in from the bottom up, yeah? I'm going to guess, too, because he's asking out loud. MARISHA and Hey, Keyleth. Do you have any of that Wild Guide-- is that what's it called? That herb that scares away the undead. You should probably do that. We could fall off this dragon's back real fast. How many? That leaves quite a few of us left. Maybe, J'mon, could you get-- They probably have seen us coming, though; they're on their way here. I shoot one with an arrow. 28. No, that doesn't hit. 15. Invisible! 25. Let's go in there, then. Let's fly in close to that waterfall. Oh god, strength? Jeez Louise. God. A 22 for me. I know! We wouldn't even know. Were they touching each other? Tell me they were. Good, so you can bamf to her. Yeah, let's head for the opening. We have Pass Without a Trace! No! Can we see where to go to? An opening? Let's just go. (fake-crying) See you on the other side of the war.
