Is that what it is, just a lot of magazines? We read your email. - Oh, they hadn't gotten to us. Oh, God, oh God! - Oh God. Yeah. - I back up, I back up. I climb back up and I bump an egg. This is gonna kill me, isn't it? Cool. This is-- is this-- Oh, wait, I'm hasted. - Seven. - Yay. - Still terrified. - Oh, good. Oh my God, she-- she ran away. Keyleth, just kill her. Find her and kill her so we can get-- It's an ongoing-- Lightning is an ongoing-- Oh! - That's crazy. - It's actually, no, I think it's better, because we're looking at it from his perspective. Oh my God. - Where's our pointer? It's been three weeks, Matt. Come on, Gilmore. Oh. - I glance up. I'm gonna get on my broom. And I'm gonna take a health potion. - So... I have a Greater. - I have one Greater. So, that's a what? 4d8? Yeah, yeah, I had a Greater left. It's jack shit. Ten, ten whole points. I'm gonna go back towards the entrance. Post up to the entrance, like off the ground as far as I can get. Hovering! Stay off the ground and can I-- I'm gonna go up ten feet. And if I can be a little bit further away from Keyleth, that'd be clutch. I mean, I don't know if it'd be clutch, but it would be helpful. Can I look up, and see if I can see like, dust coming down from any of the holes, to see if Raishan is moving around in the holes on the ceiling-- I know, I know. Is this pertaining to dragons so I would get advantage? That's the same thing. - So, perception, so that's 26. Really? Is there anything oozing out of it? I should have looked at it before. Destroyed? - She doesn't care about the eggs. Okay, so I've got-- I'm so sorry. I don't know where my notes are to see what my spells were from before. I didn't have it set up cause I'm a horrible person. Okay, this is-- this is the last one. Oh, I didn't do like any spells before. So, I'm gonna cast-- I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds on myself. I'm gonna cast it at third level. So, that's 1d8-- 2d8 plus my spell casting modifier. - 3d8? Okay. No, my modifier, which is my wisdom. Ten plus-- Jesus Christ, I'm sorry! Ten plus-- Thirteen points heal. I don't know. What if that was a baby dragon? Oh, thank you. What?! The babies will help us though. What if the babies are cute? -Can we raise them? - So, we were lining up? We're seriously lining up? No, you're in a line. - Look, I'm talking about-- Yes, there it is. - That one! That's where you are, dude. Yeah, it's reverse. I can't use inverted controls. Really? Did you just mark on your cool eggs? Oh, it's the potion. Yes. Pike's gonna heal you. - You. - Yeah, she's-- - Yeah. - She's gonna cast Cure Wounds at third level on him. So, that's three d8's. Ooh, that's pretty good. Sixteen plus her page, her modifier. What is-- oh, that's-- That's my page. Plus five, 18. -Twenty-one. - "Oh, you're welcome, Grog." - Well, you know. What is that? Does it feel good when it happens or does it feel like-- It's natural. Okay. - It's okay, we're immune to poison. Even I'm immune to poison? Oh, no. I got plus two for the ring. So, 11. Slowly my skin starts to melt off my body. Who's turn is it right now? -It's Raishan's? - What does it mean?! It's freaking me the fuck out. What if it's like-- Oh my God, that's right. What if she's like marking us for death or something? Laser pointer. Don't let me die, I need to loot. Oh, you punched a baby dragon. "Good." - In the head. What if he made-- what if it's one for every member of the Conclave? There's five eggs, but one is crushed and that would be Raishan and there would be nothing in it. I don't know. Okay, well, they're all red. Maybe they're all Thordak's. Oh my God. Is it still alive? Is it alive? Good job. That's gonna be a bruise on the ass for sure. Oh, okay, alright. I can't do anything? - It was a whole fucking turn? - Gone. Okay. It's not hurting me-- That's good, because you know what? I didn't have anything planned and it would have been a cluster fuck like last time, so fuck it. "Sorry." - "You know how they make me calm." Okay, okay. Yeah, so she's gonna cast-- what she should do mass-- Oh, on everybody and it's 30 feet. How far-- Can she move up and get-- How many people can she get in a 30 foot cone? A 30 foot radius. Vex and Percy and Grog? Let's-- okay. Maybe like in that area? - Or like, no. - Yeah! Yeah, sweet, that's great. Then she casts Beacon of Hope from there. That gives you advantage on wisdom saving throws, death saving throws, regains max number of hit points for healing. I'm hitting him with the laser. Oh! I hate her! No, it's just-- Alright. Great. Great. (coughing) (coughing) Hey, look, an egg. But you're above it. Aren't you high on the wall? Five. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey! - Next turn with disadvantage. (laughing) Oh, that was a lair action? - Oh, Jesus. This is all of us with the light. All of us with the heat. It's gonna do something, I know it. Oh, geez. Damn it! So, that's good. I don't get any bonus though. Twenty-one? Oh, oh. You roll for Pike. Oh, no! Oh, that's as high as I get without a natural 20, man! Fucking shit! Man! No, I'm-- I'm unconscious, so is Pike. -Both of us. - Pike came back. It didn't? Against? - Oh, yeah. Oh, at Fort Daxio. - Okay, so Pike's alive. - No, no, no, she got five hit points. And are there any eggs within 15 feet of her? Is there a Raishan within 15 feet of her? - Well, then, fuck it. Thanks for knocking over the little cube too. I like that added. "From what you know." Yeah. Oh, I just remembered. How many lightnings are heading towards her? Yeah, definitely. Get on up! Oh. You don't have to Grog, it's okay. I mean-- Wait, 8d4. (indistinct) Whoa, 17. - Thirty-two? That was insane, Grog! "Thanks." (snarls) (laughing) Go rage! All good. All good, all good. God, okay. Fuck. Can I shoot from my laying down position? Okay, then I'm gonna get up on my knee and shoot up. Cause I just wake up and see her right above me, don't I? Alright, then I'm gonna try to-- Oh wait, I already used Brambleshot, or at least, I tried to today. So, I'm gonna shoot her. Can I Hunter's Mark her first, though? Hey! I don't get sneak attack. Nobody's near her, right? Nineteen? Oh, that's what I rolled. - As well. Yeah. - Fuckin' A. That one, I hope, 28. Okay, so 28 on the second one. Oh God, what's happening? Sixteen plus three points of lightning. Yes. Can I move-- can I move... Can I get on my broom? Like move a one square away. - Yeah. Away from Grog and Pike, yeah. Like that makes any difference, but-- - Thanks, Grog. Invulnerable? - Oh! - My hasted had worn off, right? I just assumed it had, okay. Whoa! Ooh, like right in front of her face. - Okay. I think we should do... But okay, if she does Flame Strike can she focus it on the ceiling? Or does it have to be on the ground? Okay. So, it's her level five spell. - At Raishan? At Raishan's butt, not at Vax. Pike is always careful. - She's the carefulest. Okay. So, wow, that's a really big-- Sixty feet, damn. So, that's 4d6 plus 4d6 radiant. Okay. - Okay, wow. I roll five and you roll three. Oh, just kidding. No, I want to roll some. I roll, I'll roll three. You roll five. ♪ - Thirteen. Thirty-five. - No. - Thirty-one. - Why half? And she's gonna back up towards the opening towards the entrance a bit. -Yeah, like right there. - She's got a bonus action. - Oh, yeah, she can, right? 'Cause she can use a level two or less. So, yeah, she'll do a level-- she doesn't have any level two's left. She'll do a level one Healing Word on herself. Oh, God, she's at five hit points. - She's--she's Pike though. This is what she would have done. - I think. Oh. One d4 plus five, so yeah, seven. Yeah. (gasps) I totally forgot! I even wrote-- I wrote a limerick. For you. Wait, wait, I forgot I did it. "Have you heard tale of Scanlan, the bold? He won't tell us his age, but he's old. With his blade, he's a slayer, with the ladies, a player, but if he picks up the flute, he's pure gold." Goddammit! (laughter) I'm so nervous, I'm about to cry. - Look at all those pots of gold in the corners. Yes! - You want to make it for me? Twenty. Okay. - So she's still up. - Oh God, oh God. Yeah, he really was helping. It'd been there for like-- Even though he's immune to poison? He's not? - It was Dispel, she dispelled our Heroes' Feast. That's what that fucking shit was. - Oh, God. No, not forever! Oh God, Scanlan. Oh, God! - Scanlan! MVP! Oh God. Check out those Gilmore t-shirts. Why, they are! It's so funny you should ask. So precise. I like how he genuinely looked kind of disappointed though that he rolled a 20. It made me-- it made me feel great. I hope he shows up. I hope he's not like... I don't-- here you go. Did you double those extras? Do you double those dice as well? - Okay. She got hasted? - How? How did she get hasted? What if the brass dragon's helping her? That end of the map. Oh God. Did you just pee? She just dispelled all of us. Can we bust out a feast right now? -Just like sit down. - So, giving a potion to somebody is a full action? Did we ever? - Oh, that's from Beacon of Hope. That's gone anyway. Okay, then I'm gonna fly down to my brother. And I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds on him at fourth level, so that's 4d8. Oh, 19 plus eight, wow, 27. - You don't got no wings anymore. - No. Get away from the lava. And then, I'm gonna fly away from the lava. -Up. - Yeah, towards Matt. Up and towards Matt. - Kind of away from Pike. Actually, let's go, oh God. Yes, yes, what you just did. That way. And I get a bonus. I can do something with a bonus. I'm gonna re-Hunter's Mark her. - Yeah. Oh, wait! I can take a potion for myself as a bonus. - I'm gonna do that. Okay. Just a Superior. - That my brother gave me. It's a four. Seventeen plus eight. I do? - Ooh. So, 21 plus eight, so 29. Yeah that was, I rolled really well. I didn't trust that I would roll that well. Yes. - Everyone. "Um..." "I can deal with it. It's no big deal." Okay, thank you. Hey, look, he's standing! - Oh, J'Mon, you looking good. - J'Mon! ♪ J'Mon ♪ Wow. - Did you just burp or did you just-- Okay. Pike... She's gonna cast Mass Healing Word. Can she get the most people in her radius? It is a 60 foot radius. Okay. No. - Heals only people she wants. It's up to six creatures. Who all's-- So, that's-- - Grog and her. So, that's Grog, Pike, Vex, Vax, and Percy. And Scanlan. "Oh, sorry, Scanlan, I didn't see you there." Oh, he's gonna dispel this shit. Okay, she's gonna do this. Yeah. - Nine. - Yeah. That's a bonus, I know, I know, okay. There's not really anything else right now. All of her major spells were used. - And then, can she-- does she have any movement left? That's true. She's gonna duck as much as she can under J'Mon. - For protection. And say, "Oh, you look very nice, thank you." (laughing) "Thank you for helping us." No, shut up. For him. This is just the worst. - ♪ J'Mon ♪♪ Fourteen. - Hold on. Fourteen. She does care! - Let's kill them eggs. (yells) Gilmore didn't get the Feast. Did you say Pike? Did you say Pike as well? Fourteen. Eighty-three. Wow. - We're unconscious. Twins go out together. From like a teeny little ten foot fall? That's fucking stupid. - She was sitting stupidly! Damn it! I did, I have a helmet on. Did you-- I put airbags in the witch's hat. Oh, no, does she have more surprises? I hope that's not-- I just thought maybe the breath was the surprise. Damn it! She's carrying...? That's true. Yeah. Me and... No, just me. And Pike's like out. Doesn't it--? Don't you get the lightning attacks too? If you're doing chain lightning, you still get the other lightning's that are there? I understand. I wonder if they're elemental, like, amplifiers. You're in the cloud, but you can be restored. Cause you've been backed up. I'm unconscious. Cool. - I've got one save left. Yeah, you did, but it's not attuned. Well, I am, I'm just not getting cold-- You're unconscious. It doesn't matter what you're negative. Yeah. Well, I wouldn't count it, but yeah, that was-- that was bad. It was better when I-- What is this, what is this? Constitution, what is this? Five! Cause I suck. Pike is unconscious. Whoa. The two-- the twins and the gnomes are out. This is serious, you guys. Do you have Mass Cure, Gilmore? Cold the last time. Oh, good, good. I have to pee so bad, I got to get up. - What I'm scared of is that I'm gonna be away from the table when I actually die, but I have to pee. Just don't kill me while I'm not at the table, okay, Matt? (offscreen) Don't-- I heard that! (laughter) Gilmore just went unconscious too? Oh, no! If he was enlarged. The Greater? - That's 4d4. - Yes. But she has basically no spells left. She's got a fourth level spell. I could die. This is my last death saving throw. No advantage, no nothing. I'm using-- no, I'm not even gonna say it. (groans) - Five. - Pike is conscious with 15 points. Just-- bitch-- bitchslap Raishan. Yes! He has a base now? When did that happen? - That's great. Really? You know why this happened? Cause you took so long to call-- She had 15. -But she was-- - She was lying on-- - That's okay. A minute. She's got Sprinter's Boots on! She just texted. We didn't use them in the last fight because we didn't realize she had 'em. Well, I-- we didn't use 'em in the fight with Thordak. For Pike, though. - She's writing in all caps "Sprinter's Boots!" (laughing) Oh God. Oh God, really? Okay. Can Ashley roll, do you want to roll Ashley? She's-- oh! Oh, no! Should we read that? Oh, she should take-- she should take a potion or something. She's got a-- she's got a Greater healing-- Pike has a Greater healing potion that I know of. So she can take it. She's got 15 points. That's true. Should she wait, should she hold it? Well, I want-- it's an action if she-- if she gives it to anybody else. She can't, she can only take it as a bonus action for herself. - Oh, that's really good though. Nineteen. - We just gotta get out of here. Oh my God, we're all gonna-- I'm not gonna say it. -We're gonna-- - We're gonna get through this, you guys. We're all gonna get through this. Fuck. - Oh my God. Goddammit. You got one left, Scanlan? Well, this, you know what? I rolled an eight for Pike. And a one for me. Okay, I'm unconscious. This is so fun, you guys, I love this fight. Pike's at 29. Oh no, this is gonna be Scanlan. Was I in there? That's good. - Eleven for Pike. Seriously? - She's unconscious. We're-- we're-- I don't know how we're gonna get Scanlan back. But he's there and-- Just waiting, crossbow loaded. Yeah, and then we can't get out. A bunch of dead people, you could get a bunch of dead people out? That wasn't her last spell, by the way. She's got three spell slots left. Close to death? - He's closer to death than me. Pike's unconscious. - I'm one fail, he's two fails. Scanlan's dead. I've got Cure Wounds if I'm awake. No, Keyleth, no. I don't know, man, lava. Lava has a new rule now. Oh my God. 53! - Get up, get out, you can get out of it. You've got seven points left. Can she get out of the lava or is she just in? Belly flopped into lava. At least you're out. - Oh my God. This is the worst! Does J'Mon Sa Ord have any healing spells? Sweet, even better. You're double digits. Scanlan, we've got to just-- we've got to get Scanlan back. It's Gilmore. - The round's still going. So, it's Grog, it's your turn, Grog. 4d8 plus four. I mean, 4d4 plus four. So, Pike is awake. "What's going--" Actually, she does have a third level spell left. - Yes! She cast Revivify at fourth level the last time. Holy shit. I have it circled. Right. I'm scared of all these dice. I failed it. Yeah, cause the only time you used it before was when you BAMFed up to my broom after I grabbed the dagger. Yes. Kima's conscious. It's the last egg. Just worried there's gonna be another lair action in the same spot. It needs like a dispel or something. I wonder-- I wonder if the beehive thing above us, that the holes are covered in magic as well. Am I-- I am conscious. But I don't know what that says. But it's now. My question is, Pike runs up, thank you. Oh, oh! If she runs up, is she gonna be able to get her hand on-- on Scanlan? She says "She can use the Sprinter's Boots twice" in all caps. Actually she did write that before we said it. - Okay. So, Pike puts her hands on either side of his face and says, "Scanlan. Your letter to me was wonderful and I want to do what you asked but I can't raise Kaylee alone, I need you to come back." And she casts Revivify on him. I'm so scared. Thirteen? "Warm up. Does anybody have a blanket?" - "Okay." - She did. She sent a picture of the Sprinter's Boots cards with two uses. Glad you're back, Scanlan. Are we gonna have to take a short rest? Can I-- can I-- I know I'm gonna-- Can I broom up to the holes? God, I'm so scared to get on this broom again. Oh, in our order? Did you let the dog out? Scanlan, did you let the dog out? Do you have it left? - Why would you just-- Wait, but-- I hate that we can't get out of this fucking area! Don't get too close into this area, Percy, cause this is where the fucking lair action keeps coming up. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna run and hit an egg? There's an egg left over there. - Did it look like Thordak? You were right! Or by-- Maybe we should hold onto a piece and try to pass through it. That's me. I used a level-- did I use a level four spell already? Shit. Oh, that's right, I did. I did use it cause I was-- So I have a level three left. Who needs healing? Me and Pike and everybody. You do. So do I, I got five. I got five points, how many you got? So you have nine points. I'm gonna take a healing potion. I mean, I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds on myself. - So, 20 points. - Okay. Can I run over and get some dragon guts on my hand and then to try to put my hand through the thingy? Please let me out of this spot. Oh! Does your guilt have a Mass Cure Wounds? In that case, doesn't matter. Oh, geez. Fuck. - Fuck! Fuck. Can I sense anyone but J'Mon Sa Ord as far as dragons go nearby? I drop down to my knees and concentrate. - Nothing! Nothing. She's nowhere. Fuck. I can't believe that we all came back. It was just giant clusterfuck from like halfway through with just everybody falling down and trying to get back up. Unconscious. So, gone, gone-gone. - And then if you hadn't counter spelled the color... What?! Oh my God! - Wait, what is a 10? Is 10 insta-death, what is 10? Well, hopefully, oh my God. Oh, yeah, if J'Mon had not gotten three, two, one. I got to attack one time that round. Every other round was just trying not to die.
