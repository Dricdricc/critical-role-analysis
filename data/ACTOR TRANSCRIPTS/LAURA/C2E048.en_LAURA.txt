No! No. I mean not that, he showed me a picture of his nipples, and I said no. Yes to Carmen Sandiego, though. Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they rise from the flames for the battles ahead. Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead. (singing) Can you answer the call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll! [fire burning] Nicodranas! Yes, we did. We forged them real good. We never changed it; it's still The Balleater. I think so, yeah. Yeah. I guess I'm going to be human with black hair instead of blue hair. Do you want to be blue? Blue's a really good color. Really nice to look at. Like, "Look at that little pink girl!" Give yourself wings! Yeah, little cute dragonfly wings on you. Little teeney. You want dragonfly, or--? I'm going to put some makeup on Beau over here. I'm going to do Yasha's makeup again, but I'm not going to make her look like a snake person this time. This time she's going to look real cute. I'm going to put some red lipstick on her, and maybe put her hair in a topknot. Here's your documentation sir, Orly, sir. Yes, I will definitely send you a message if we need anything. Oh! Awesome! He's magic. Take care of that crew, they're real good! Oh, I think I know a pretty good one! I know of a really good one! I rolled a four. Oh, shit, I think it's in Zadash. That's where I got that box made, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, never mind. Do you want it? Wait, I left it at the blacksmith. I did, yeah. Yeah? Oh, yeah, my mom was big on books. It was a little bit better. 11. Yeah, I'll lead the way. I was going to lead Caleb to the bookstore. Whoa. It's this way. You just walk over here and then you go down this street. Really? Oh, I never went here, no. No. No. No, no, no! My mom was there, but we didn't, you know, go places. But I did see a bookstore, I swear, from my window. See? This is what I was talking about, this one right here, Front to Back. I did go out sometimes, yeah. I got to go, you know, on errands sometimes, yeah. The Traveler's really cool. And Bluud! I mean, you know, that guy, he hung out with me sometimes. Yeah. It was, he let me hang on his horns. No. What color was the cat? Do you know where we would go to find arcane books and stuff? He's a really good poet. Mm-hmm! Slam poetry, right now! Anything that comes to your mind! While he's also out, I will paint a little dick next to the front and a little booty next to the back of his sign. Front to Back. Typical ink. I would like to buy the book about cooking, please. Cinnamon in pastries. Do you also have a book about mushrooms? I would like one of those, thank you. Something where you can cook the mushrooms. You got it. Thank you. Do you want to put that in the bag? Here. Oh wait, what did you ask me? At the Lavish Chateau. Where else would we stay? What are you talking about? Yeah, but we don't look like ourselves. What difference does it make? Oh. Should we recast it? I recast it. Shall we go home? That's a really high-level spell, but-- I did, sort of, but they were walking away. I cast Sending to Caduceus. So we're going to my mama's house. You guys should meet us there. We're going to stay there tonight. I don't know for sure if that's happening, but I'm sure it'll be okay. Also, we get to see Nugget again-- I don't have a "you can reply to this message," so you-- I look up into the rafters and see if Professor Thaddeus came home. Even with a natural 20 I don't think I would see Professor Thaddeus, but I did not roll that. I rolled a ten. Too bad, man. That would have been really cool, huh? I go running upstairs. No, come! Mm-hmm. Yeah. Drop it. Mama! We're back! We're pirates. Yes. Oh, yes. How was the city when we left? Was everything okay? I know! We're infamous. Cool. How's Nugget? This dog got big! Hi! Have you been training him? He's so cute! Yeah! Of course we are! I feel like he's known you longer, though. If you're going to miss him, you know, you can-- Are you sure, Mama? Okay. Can we stay here? In the rooms. I don't know what we're doing. I mean, I don't want to impose or anything, you know? Sure. We can hang out. I know there's stuff we need to do and stuff. Now that we're back on land, I feel better. We got another boat! It's way cooler. But he's holding it for us. Serious? We're pirates! Well, we were. Who was the client? Did he have hair from another guy on? Was he bald? Was he big and bald? Okay, well, we only met a couple people, so. He could, my mom is really, really cool and worth traveling for. Well, then it would be like the tower curves down sometimes and then lifts back up. You know what I mean? Yeah, it's different! Thank you. I don't think we should look at the tower. I don't think we should do that. I used up three spells already. Yeah. Let's go scope it out. Let's go stare at it a while. Yeah. The paint is always with me. Let's do it! I kiss her on the cheek. Should we take Nugget with us as we go? Good idea. But what if Nugget could go poof and go into it? And then we're like Oh no, my dog! He went in and now I have to go in too to get him out. Let's leave him here. TRAVIS' I guess we can leave him here for the time being. Really? Do you want any company? Yeah. Someone to stare over your shoulder and see what you're reading and talk to you while you're trying to-- Are you sure Nugget won't bother you? Do you need anything? Okay. Nugget. I love you. Stay with Caleb. Don't bamf away. Stay with him. He loves you so much. You're going to have a good time. Okay, bye! I think we should go to the one in the Open Quay. Are we disguised still? We're not disguised anymore. Whoa. Do we see anything cool? Yeah. You're tall. I don't think so. I don't need them. I can heal people on my own. Yeah. Oh yeah, that's a good point. Three. Whoa. What do you have that's secret? (gasps) Okay. Oh, it's a weapon. Is it a wand? Hmm? What? Huh? (groans) Ugh, it hurts me. (grumpily) No. Nothing else. I don't think she likes us, Caduceus. Are you tired? Are you falling-- Bobstomper. Yeah. I bet she could do some damage. We're going to sneak into her shop and steal what's behind the counter? Yeah, all right. We're in the Open Quay. How wide is it, though? What if you get stuck? What about Blink? Oh, that's fucking hot when you put a hot thing in it! Ow! Yeah, I'm fine. Wouldn't that be a bit obvious? MARISHA and Can't we just knock on the door? TRAVIS and Can't we just knock on the wall? I did. Uh-huh. Hi! Can he help us? Can we still see the door? What does the door look like? Whoa. Yeah. We could all be dead. I'm boasting a little. But it might to the dude you work for. (coos) What does the guy look like? (coos) Oh good! Mom loves it. You should have said something, Nott. But why? Why will he do that? Oh, save that paper. Caleb will want it. That is not true, Beau. Oh my gosh, the Happy Fun Time Ball! What if-- You know how all these things were stolen from people? What if maybe they were stolen from this guy? But then we'll have to give it back to him. No, it's his. We'd have to give it back. That's how it works here in Nicodranas. I don't want questions. I want to go back to the Fappy-- The Happy Fun Time Ball! There are so many secrets there! The Fappy Fun Time Ball. Caleb should have been here. We have one! Let's go back to it. As soon as I come home, I go Nugget, home! I love him. We're home. You didn't come to the dinner at all, Caleb? I'm pretty sure it's just because we think it's cool. Maybe he's really nice and he wants to be our best friend. No, that didn't really sound like him very much. What do you think, Yasha? Good call. I worry that he's going to do something to you Caleb, personally. Yeah. It was a real special knock. I think I can. Are we right in front of the tower? Take notes, Fjord. Knock, knock, knock. Wait, does that not sound like a goblin? Where is it? Look up! We have really good tea! 21! But we have better tea than that. Don't you want our tea, though? Knows it all! (whispers) Just one person gets to go in? Oh, I thought it was just choose one. Oh, there is a plus one! I don't want to show him the dodecahedron. (singing) But you can look at it and get a little lucky luck! Don't call him a-- Well yeah, but I don't know him. Don't lose this, okay? That's the Fappy Fun Ball. Caduceus! You don't do that, Beau. That's not true. You're beautiful and you're also really nice. Yeah, that's what I said. Look at it, Beau. Checking the boxes, checking the boxes! And all three of you bamf to... (laughter) Can we go in? Does it mean we can go in? Are they coming out? Most definitely. I walk in very politely. (humming) (singing) I'm already in the door. Jester Lavore. We almost died in there. Can you teach him? How long until you can do something like that, Caleb? Or candy. It drops gold sometimes, though. Was he a good guy or a bad guy? Yeah, because his pet dragon hadn't seen him in a long time or something. We gave you a cool ball. Yeah, you could probably just kill us right now if you wanted to. It makes babies. Yeah. Really? Are we sure about this? Oh! I think the Tri-Spire stole it from the Xhorhasians and they were trying to get it back. Make babies. Well, that's what the guy said. Do you have any ways to protect us? Right now, we're keeping it in this bag. Do you have any better way to keep it secret? Oh, right. Okay. (quietly) That's my name. (gasps) Have you ever heard of the Traveler? I look in my bag and I get out a little figure that I made of him. He's really big on balance too. Here, I'll leave it for you. That's also a present, okay? Yeah, okay. There we go. I'll stick it under the-- there you go. He's really powerful! Yay! That's my name! But you can memorize the rune. There's cinnamon in 'em! Bourbon biscuit? That's delicious. Honestly, a fish biscuit doesn't sound terrible. Lobster? What did you do? What'd you learn? What did he sell you? Did you see a cool room or anything? Maybe multiple rooms? What did he talk to you about? Did he talk at all or was he just like, "Hmm?" What did you say? Did you say we're really cool and you love us so much? He did a great job, apparently! What, the door opened, you guys. (singing) It was so cool. You learned something new. Tell him about your open slots. You talk about slots a lot. I mean, honestly, Nott. Isn't, you know, your hometown in a little bit of danger? I mean, maybe we should, you know? Well, of course I do, but my Mama's here and people you care about could be in danger. Well yes, of course, Caleb, but people could be in danger. Only if it's okay with everyone. I could always catch up with you all. One more night. Set off in the morning? Yeah? All right. (singing) Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are we doing? Fjord? Yeah. I think we should go straight to Felderwin, right? Oh. Well, I mean-- No no no, those can stay. I've moved on. (laughter) (whispers) Mama. Oh Mama, thank you so much. I got you something, too. I get out one of my jars of honey. It comes from an island in the middle of the sea. Very, very sweet; just like your little sapphire. I miss you already. I'll send you messages as much as I can, you know. Okay. Love you, Mama. Come on Nugget, let's go! (whispering) It's okay. I just stare at Mama, watch the Chateau as we go. Don't take my eyes off it. I should forge something really fast. Who do we know-- From somebody in Zadash? Didn't we? Shit. What was that guy's name? That, after we won the thing and then we were in his-- Where you met the guy! Trent Iki-- Ichi-- When you met him-- When Yasha met him-- Remember we were in that party? Starosta! Zadash. Yeah, but I could forge something. Yeah, but that's where we're heading to. No, but I guess we could say we are going to Starosta What's-His-Fuck in Al-- Yeah, I do have his. Yeah, the smarmy guy. Yeah. That we are heading back-- That we were in Nicodranas on his behalf, and that we are heading back to Alfield to return with his new... pet. I should use the mote. Zoom zoom zoom. Okay. Add proficiency and dexterity? Okay, that would be 20 plus proficiency-- 23. Yes, we were getting his new pet. They're very rare apparently, or something, hmm. We are returning to the Empire. To... To the old platinum dragon of course! Just like everybody else! Shit. That's cocked! Balls, I wanted to take the 17 that was barely there. Deception? Nine? Nein! That old platinum dragon. Ooh. Sure do love that guy. (laughter) No, we just have Nugget. Ooh! I'm going to try to teach Nugget. You know, just work on that whole bamfing in and out and staying with us. Okay. 12? Okay, at least there's that. Thanks, Caleb. What is it called? What is the name of it? The Salty Sea! Oh, wait. I feel like I-- The Salty Sea, huh? Heyo. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anywhere. As long as you know they're on this plane. Yeah, maybe I can try. It's usually somebody that I know of, so if you describe them pretty well, maybe I can? Dairon, okay. Okay, extra-special roommate. Okay. Oh, no! When did she get sent away? What does she look like? It helps me. Okay, dark clothes... Super buff, got it. Do you love her? Good times. Good times, okay. You can keep-- in my head, just keep saying those things as I'm like Think about her, picture her. What do you want me to say? Hey, girl. Heading to Felderwin. This is Beau. Maybe heading to Zadash after that. You know, if you're in the area, hit me up. Booty call? Call me back! Yeah, she can't call you back. I should have told you that. Yeah. Oh, sweet. Really? Sending, they can respond to me, that's right! I totally forgot! She's in Bladegarden, got it. Got it, Bladegarden. Waiting for the call back. Just waiting for a, "Hey," back. She hit me up! Not me, not, "She was hitting me up,"-- you up, through me. She's in Bladegarden. She's recovering. She was hurt or something. She sounded either sleepy or injured or something. But she's safe now. So Bladegarden. She sounded way into you. Yeah, like super-duper. Caleb is really cool! Yeah. We still can create food and water. Yeah, sure. Just say what's up. Well, mostly, we're just wondering if you have any information about what's been going on. Are you worried? It's pretty close to here! What's your sewer system like here? Cool. I'm sorry we're so weird sometimes, you know? Grown weirder. Jinx. Up and out, I say. Hey, Caduceus? I want to have wrapped up the little cookbooks that I bought, nice and pretty. I used the ribbon from my mom's house. I got you a present. They're cookbooks, and one of them uses mushrooms a lot! Yeah. Just in case, you know, you wanted to change up your recipes, or you thought you needed anything cool like that. Right? The pictures are really nice. You're welcome. Nott, where are-- Where is your family? Where are they located? I'm sure not the actual city-city, right? Yeah? What about... you know? Yeah, the guy. Did you recognize them? Just like Yussa. Learn about that too, okay? Did we hear anything they said? Okay. Man, I wish I could read lips. Yeah? Martinet Lunidus-- that's all I got. I know! What's going on? Are you sleepy? Are you getting sleepy, Caleb? (neighing) Nott? Do you want help looking? Of course. I'm going to help Nott search through the rubble. Okay. I try to slam into the door to open it. Ten. I'm sorry, Nott. Yasha? Maybe I can cast Dispel Magic? Is it magic? Is it trapped? I'm going to cast Dispel Magic. Or maybe they came in through-- I go up, and can I touch and see if there's an invisible person in the chair? I'm going to sit in the chair and see what I see. What does it look like from the chair? Like maybe this old dodecahedron down here? Not here. Wait, "rumors we squashed by spreading a batch of molded fruit crop." Kryn, that's what they actually are. (gasps) "Blah blah blah, extremely difficult to work with. Attempts to isolate "a substance capable containing and sustaining the dunamantic energies within a casing has "proven both time-consuming and costly--" You have some of the same stuff. Wait, look-- I don't know. "In these past weeks, we have successfully distilled a single vial "that should enable a temporary influx of dunamis to even an untrained soldier. "Once I can remove the beacon itself from the process, I hope to have this alchemist produce "a number of batches over the next 12 to 16 months, refining the method with each step "until we can certify its use in combat." Is that your friend, the alchemist? Listen, listen! "Word has found me of Trent finding a few of his proteges have a knack "for early dunamancy--" blah blah, something, something. "I am eager to look over their findings "and perchance fold these skills into my own. Imagine--" something something, "--could be "accomplished by the Assembly should we further learn to command these--" There's so many things I can't read because it's burned away! "--existence. The dreams are already thrilling." You don't? They're going to be so pissed when they find out we have that thing. Oh no, that's going to be way harder to cover up. We can put the foldable tripod-- We have a Bag of Holding? Oh, that's right. Why should we break the chair? We need to get out of here. Let's go. Quickly. No, I just saw the room. Was there anything under the chair? On the underside of the chair? Go, go. Do we need to clean up Caleb's puke? Will somebody be able to find us with his puke? Not here, no. It's staying in the bag, don't worry. You need somewhere--? We can send a message anytime. Yeah, my mama-- You sneaky motherfucker! I can't wait to interrogate you.
