Yeah. No, it's been more than once. Maybe you can do an interpretive dance there as well? There is no end to dick jokes. And look how cute it looks under overalls. Those are in the store right now! As well as our new CR logo shirt, which nobody is wearing. Okay. I'll get one for you. At GeekandSundry.com! The shop! There it is! Yeah, it is. It's like the sophisticated version. Yeah. We have some dice as well as lots of other merch, so check it out. Oh, hi. No. Not so much. Not a lot of money. No. No. Nothing really. But I saw the Traveler, so that's good news, everyone. He's still around, he's here. He's probably hanging out with us right now. Yes. Well, probably, yes. Well, not a lot of people know who he is yet, so really, no, I don't think I'll get in trouble. Well, I don't know if he's new, but he is just not well-known, especially here. I'm sure where he's from everybody knows him because he's really cool, so I bet a lot of people are like, "Oh my god, I love you!" Yes, basically. Yeah! Yeah, he's really cool. He's so powerful. You guys should really see what he can do, because it's amazing. Well, he can do lots of magic, and he can appear out of nowhere. That's cool. No. I can ask him! Yeah! Yeah. Well, Traveler, you heard it yourself! If you like everyone here, you can just show up anytime! Well, it's possible he's just invisible right now. He does that sometimes. Yeah. Yeah, it happens. Yeah! You know, he's just this guy. I don't know exactly what he looks like, because he's got this hood. I imagine that he's really handsome. I think he's really cute. He sounds really cute. He can probably hear me right now. I'm so embarrassed! (laughter) Right? Maybe he'll start talking to you too! Oh, well he might get-- you know what? He might think that's really fun. That could be fun. Maybe you have to get somewhere really quiet, because the first time I heard the Traveler it was super duper quiet. Fjord, can I ask you a question? Do you remember how long it took us to get from Port Damali to the border into-- So wait. If I sent a message from Alfield, then-- or, wait. Where were we when I sent that message? Then would it have got to Nicodranas and to Zadash by now? Okay. No, I just had an itch-- you have a little dirt on your face, but other than that. So maybe that's what it is, that's why. She was going to send it to The Pillow Trove. Yeah. It would be a pretty expensive package, so I feel like-- maybe I could do that. I don't know what it is, but I'll look into that. I have a room there tonight, you guys. The thing is that apparently it's not easy to get into that district. Shabby chic. Maybe we can go somewhere and they will make a coat exactly like that coat with all the same pockets, only it won't have the holes in it. Yeah, that's probably good too. Or we just keep going to visit that guy who made you clean. Every day we could go see him, and then he makes us all clean! What, to use his power like that? I want to ask The Traveler if he knows how to do that, because I wonder if he could make me do that. No, I've only seen that guy. Mm-hmm. No, they're just unicorns. We've got to get to that sewer, you guys! But we'll have to get clean or else we won't get in there. I think they only have to let me in, technically. I have this key. It says Pillow Trove on it. Oh yeah, Beau has it right now. So is it better to go now or tomorrow morning? Late afternoon, you said? You have an adventurer's kit? Oh, I have an axe now! Yay! Yes. Yeah. It's cold. Hey guys, we're about two blocks away from the outer wall. We're super close. What guard was it that ran away? They're probably eaten completely by now. Oh no, but how will we get out? What if we get trapped at another one and then we can't get out? Okay. (whistle and intone theme of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly) I move to the other side of Nott. (yells) Do you see any monsters down there? Oh, sure. Wait, which one was it? What about this one? You don't. Can we come down? He locked us in! I think a monster would be down. I feel like we're walking in a stinky crotch. Why?! The Traveler! LIAM and Do we see any rats down here? In the direction of where we came from? Does that mean we're going the wrong way or the right way? Ew! Oh my God! I didn't even put it together. I just want this. Is it blood? I might throw up. Yeah, you're right. We turn around. You should probably lick the ground everywhere and see if you taste that blood anymore. Any webbing? Perception? 21. Guys, guys, look, look! Bring the torch over! It's a webbing! Maybe that would be bad, though. Maybe you should be in the middle. Have you ever been at a haunted house? They come at you from behind! I guess I'll be right behind Molly. Yeah! I bet that's where we need to go. It's blocked. (whispering) What is it? Poke it with your stick! How close is it to us? We're fighting poop-rats! That's what happens when I roll one that I haven't been charging up. It just looks wet. Matt is very committed. Oh no! See, Caleb, look, you should've been in the middle of us! (chanting) Level three! Oh shit, really? Eight. No, mine was nine! TRAVIS and It might've been eight. Let's just make it eight because I can't remember if I rolled a five or a six. You just got bit by a rat, running away. Is it also yellow water? MATT and Fjord! Why you got to fart while we're fighting? Oh no. That's good. I look like I have an unarmed strike too, but I don't think I do. Okay. I'm going to run up to the one that just attacked Yasha. Yeah, and I'm going to hit it with my handaxe because I'm not very smart. That definitely hits. That's 21. That's a seven. Aw, you see it was like, (strains) no, fuck you. Oh no. I think so. Wait! Yeah, I don't want to use that just yet. Oh no. Are there more rats? It's really pretty though, what a pretty die. Oh no, Matt! Wait, how do we know where we're going, though? How will we choose? Okay, we go that way. Oh no, how hurt is everyone? Right? I should do a Cure Wounds on you. Okay. I cast Cure Wounds on Yasha! That's above your whole-- That's why I said it. Eight points. Oh. How hurt are you, Beau? Oh, okay. Let me know, you guys, because I've got lots of healing! Because I'm the cleric. I think something's making those things like that. Oh god, what if it's a giant spider? And it's infecting the rats. (whispering) And they're turning into poisoned-- Poison balloons? (groaning) I think they're full of pus! Just really infected rats. We should keep going. Should we be more sneaky, or should we just walk? We could set them on fire from a distance. Yeah, but what if they all spring up. We could just set them on fire. Okay then, let them live, and die in horrible pain. Oh yeah, here you go! Who is the most noisy of us all? Which one of you fuckers needs some help? Well here, take an advantage. Just kidding. Hold on, I have to check-- Eight. Not so good. Let's set it on fire! Or it could be somebody that's being slowly sucked dry of all their blood. Should we set it on fire, or should we see if it's living? Is it wiggling at all? 15. I think it's dead. Or it's sedated. It's a dog. Let's cut it down. That's good to know. That means the human-sized ones are probably fucked up too. How long ago did they say the guards went down and didn't come back? Yeah. What if we back up and burn it? That's why I said; why don't we back up and burn it? Well, Caleb, how about you send your spectral servant to poke at the little masses of human and see if they start wiggling? They'll probably end up as giant pus sacks if they survive. I said poke it. Then if they wiggle, then we know that they're alive. Do it, Caleb! It's unseen. I go up and I push it. I think your unseen servant farted on me. I wonder if the giant spider thing heard that. (loudly) I said I wonder if the giant-- You. Burn that shit then the spider will come and we will burn that shit too! I'll stand behind Fjord. We could take their weapons, I bet they're nice weapons. Or we could return them to the Crownsguard, maybe they would reward us? TALIESIN and Can I take their helmets and put them in my pink bag? What about their weapons? Do they have any? Does it say anywhere "Property of the Crownsguard?" How is it to try to chop through it with the axe? Yeah, I want to try doing it and see if it sticks to the weapon or if it cuts through. Yeah. Seven. (metal plink) Except it's covered in webbing so not as much sound. Can I get my handaxe back? Thanks, Caleb. It's a dead end past all of this? It's a dead end and just goes up? It's got to be around here somewhere, right? Should I go up? Okay. Is it blocked in and webby all along the ground? I stop walking. I don't like it either. Is he reachable? (whispered) He's still 20 feet away from me. You guys! Hey fuckers! I'm a little worried about walking any further because my feet are starting to stick to the ground, like a lot. But there's a halfling stuck to the wall over here and I don't think he's dead. No, I'm 20 feet away from it. How close is it to you guys? Oh no! It's an invisible spider! We're not invisible, those are dead people! I see dead people. Where before it disappeared? Wait, why are all the other things invisible? Does that mean those are other things that are going to attack us? 22! I had a 22. Man, you always have the shittiest initiative! Yeah, why do you guys always have bad initiative? Weird. I'm up first! Okay, did I hear it happen to Fjord? Did I hear anything? Oh no! I cast Spiritual Weapon, a giant purple lollipop! Oh no. I've got some, but you have one too, don't you? No, you have the one. Don't you have the one? That Brittany made? Somebody took a picture of it then disappeared it? I make a giant teal lollipop instead! Here you go. Directly overhead of where the spider disappeared. I'm going to, oh god, cast Sacred Flame on the place that it was at. Can I do that? Yeah. On the place that I saw it. It's not invisible guys, it's gone. I'm going to back up against-- oh no, if I back against a wall, it's sticky, isn't it? I'm going to take a couple steps, if I can, like up on those rocks next to Yasha is it? Yeah. Yes. The spider is in between Fjord and Beau. I thought Travis would make the note, but he's not. Where? It's Relentless! Yes! You have something in your throat, Molly. Or did you throw it on the table and Matt snatched it up? Yeah, she didn't get a session zero. Yeah! It's blinded! Okay can I come around the corner and get out of this nastiness? Ooh, it really did stick to it. Can I see everything? Okay I'm going to send my spiritual weapon down there to bash it over the head! How did Yasha get all the way there and my thing didn't get there? That's so stupid. Okay. Yeah, it's only 20. Then I'm going to use Cure Wounds. Is it touch? Motherfucker! Yeah but it's like dog shit. Aw, look at that. Isn't it so pretty? Healing Word is such dog shit, as far as what it can do. Psh, sure whatever. I guess I'll do Healing Word to cure you. But you're going to go down again, it's not enough to heal you-- Oh, you are? I'm going to-- I'm sorry, you guys. I'm going to Sacred Flame it, then. 1d8 radiant. Okay. Aw, two. Yeah, it does. You should just kill it! Kill it! It's already nervous, kill it and don't worry about healing yourself. Destroy it, Fjord! Oh, thank god. The music. On Yasha's move. Yes, I'm going to on my turn. Legerdemain? Okay. How far away are they? I'm going to move forward. Can I get all the way to Fjord? I'm afraid to get too far away from Caleb. I'm going to heal you. Okay, good. You'll gain seven more than I can heal you, because I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on him! SAM and Yay. Six points. You don't owe me shit. I'm going to move my spiritual weapon in the middle, closer to Beau. Yeah. (screams) (sigh of relief) It died! Yay, we killed it! Okay! No, we got all of it off, remember? 18? No, 17? Seven damage! No, don't take it away. I'm going to lick it. It didn't hit anything. It's not even covered with any guts. I'm going to go back to the halfling guy that's kind of alive. Does he look injured at all? Oh shit. Can I have grabbed that as I walk over to him? Can I put my hand on his head and cast Cure Wounds? Now. 11. Blessed child. You are alive. Your saviors have come. You don't know how you got down here? You didn't come to the sewer on your own? No need to scream. We're getting you out, don't worry. Do you have a key to the grates? Can you give us the key? Thed. Thed, where is the key? Which pocket is it in? I can start digging. I start digging through his pockets. That's a tattoo, you said? I rolled an 11 checking through his pockets. Okay. Oh no, eggs. Oh no! Kill it with fire! I Sacred Flame it. Got to kill them all! Just keeping all that for yourself, then, Yasha? Did you say two sets of armor? Would that fit in the bag? Would that fit in the bag? Two sets of armor? Okay, we'll bring these back to the Crownsguard and hopefully get some reward. Is everybody a greedy fuck in this game and we just keep whatever? Cool. Vex never lied about the loot we found. Never once. Never once, for all the shit she got for being greedy, she never once lied about the loot. She's a terrible half-elf. I didn't take anything from you! I didn't take anything from his pockets. (gasp) Yeah, it's in the letter! His name was Thed. I didn't take anything from your pockets. I really didn't. You really do have like a key to the grates, like an extra one? Anything else interesting in the room, outside of the bodies? Aww. Both. I wonder if this grate leads up into the Tri-Spires, then. Maybe it means lots of rich people are up here. Maybe. Easy pickings. If they don't allow the criminals in, then they'd be real easy to pickpocket, because no one would expect it. Well, we can probably call up. We have the writ. Well, it's all tied up. Me and Yasha can probably-- Sure. I put my hands on either side of his face. Can I see anything weird? Okay. I do, I do. Caleb, I don't-- Those are really, really strong. Okay, but I'm not keeping it just for me, you know. It's for both of us. Of course. Caleb. Thank you. And I'm sorry. Do you need curing, though? Because your eyes do look bloodshot. All right, we'll carry it. Oh my gosh, yes. Because you have a big lollipop to carry. Up these things, into the money pot. Well, somebody that can talk to the guards. TRAVIS and Is it locked? Can you pick the lock? Yeah, I think it's just two right now. Hey you guys, this is where my hotel is. Are you trying to figure out if the stores are still open? Good call. I'll get out my disguise kit and put a mustache on the spider. It's really bright and shiny in the hotel, though. Should we just make it straight-- Just go straight and just stay. Yeah, let's go straight out and leave and go to the Crownsguard. Maybe we should shut the gate up and then lock it. So they don't know. Oh yes, don't worry, we're staying at the Pillow Trove, but we have this very beautiful writ. Thank you! Oh, we are really powerful. We killed it! We took care of the monster problem. We're going to clean up, we'll be back. This is not normally how we dress, ugh, we were in the sewers. The evil monster that was killing everything. Oh my gosh, lots and lots and lots of baby spiders. We have armor too, of some of your fallen people, will you reward us for that, thank you! Beau! Stop it, we're about to get our reward, stop being a shithead right now. I have them. Here's two sets of armor. And two extra helmets. Leaky Tap. At the Pillow Trove, yes. What does that mean, "of course you do?" I do have a room there! I pull out my key. I have a room. I don't know why it mattered. (laughter) Just the armor. I didn't give back the swords. She seemed really nice. Yes, 100 gold. I was going to wait until we got somewhere private to do it, but sure. Everyone take 100 gold. We all smell like poop! Yeah, but we should probably get cleaned up, because they're just going to stop us the minute we get inside. Should we go and see Pumat Sol, and see if he'll make us clean? We're not in the Tri-Spires anymore. We have to get not stinky before we eat, okay? Are we going to bed, or are we what? We're pretending that there's a bath. That's why we should have gone to Pumat Sol's. His letter? So. I walked in and the guy was like-- you know, he had his arms above his head, he was chained to the bed, right? He didn't know where he left the key! I know I don't even know how long he'd been there. Oh, people will pay for all sorts of weird things. Oh, hi guys! The cult? The orgy cult? So they offered you money? They offered you money to join in. Don't you think it's stupid to say all of this right here? Yes. How can we be sure he's telling the truth? But how do you know that he isn't setting you up to be turned into the Crownsguard? Like kicked to death? Wait a minute, is it wrong to pick wings off flies? Because that's not-- Not if they're already dead, then you can pick the wings off super duper easily. What's a firefly? Oh wow. Oh yeah, we can go back to the Pillow Trove and all hang out and sleep in the same room if you want. No, it's kind of little, actually. You guys, it's really little, actually. Yeah we all look nice enough, they might let us in. If not, let's all go-- Yeah. Sure, we walk back to the guards and I show them the key. Can we get in? All right. Oh, I don't really want to stay in there alone. The Evening Nip. Does he look, like, mean at Fjord? What is his type? Pretty! See, Fjord, you're just so handsome. Yeah, maybe not the best place to celebrate, just putting it out there. Maybe you should ask him about his tattoos since you have tattoos as well. Like, unless we're going to do this we should get out. Just go back to The Leaky Tap and then, you know. This is awful, and I don't want it. Thank you, Clive Bens! I know, I feel like it's just at home and we can just like-- He's so stinky now. That's so cool!
