What?! That's going to take so long! I did it! I have 138 hit points? This random character that I just created is really fucking cool. I was Alight, a level 15 fire genasi. Alight. Sam, stop touching my shit. Look at that! He rolled ones, ones, and ones! I'm sorry. Sorry, Matthew. That's why I wrote Broad Barn down. What do you guys want to do today? I liked it. Do they need to feed? What gods were you being sacrificed to? Was it just your parents and you that were being sacrificed? Did they want to kill you or just take your blood? Oh! So it wasn't so bad, they just slowly drained you. Does it have to be your blood? No dreams at all? We can steal some things! I thought we already got paid. Let's keep helping! We could stay here forever and just kill gnolls. But think about how good we would get over time. Mm-hmm! When did we agree that? Did we agree to that? Usually when you agree to something you have to say it out loud. Most of the time. Unless it's, like-- We just agreed to it! You said it, you said it! I can't tell, it's a secret! Oh! But she's serious about it, I can tell! Do you want a donut this morning? It's a little more stale in the bag, I have to let you know. Do you want one? Wait! When did we say we were going to meet Bryce? I thought they were leaving. In front of Broad Barn. What if it's a street? We didn't clarify, did we? I bet we can ask the guy downstairs. Do you want some help? I'll come help you! After we've cooked, I'm going to switch out his salt for his sugar. 19. After we cooked. Sure. You're a halfling, too, so maybe you should talk to him. Oh, this was your place? Oh, wow. Oh, no. How much gold do you need? I just had that, too! I'm sorry, I don't have it anymore. But I could try writing to my mom to see if she'll help you. I love him so much! Shrimp scampi. Butterfly shrimp. Fried shrimp. Oh! It's a store! I bet it's big. Wow, this is a really good talk that we've had. I think I'm going to go look for the Broad Barn Maybe we'll find all of those thousands of gold for you, and you can build your shop back up. We're really tough. We have no fear. I will. Here. It's a moldy donut. Be well, child, the Traveler is with you. You know my name! I leave. Dick. We're going to kill all of them! Syphilis can come with legs-- I feel their pain. Specifically their heads, too? I bet we can find some ghosts. Do you know where they are? So we know how to steer clear? Ooh! That would be why some of them have chunks missing out of them. Fire hydrant. We'll get this stuff and head right out. Was it hit at all? Was the store that we're going into destroyed at all? Have fun dealing with the dick. Did I recognize Starosta Kosh? Did he seem like the type that would have made a little side trip down to-- because he seems like the type. Intelligence, 18. Good to know. Wait, wait. How much incense do you need? On incense?! And that five sticks was five silver's worth? That is a lot of incense to burn. Do you have any pickles? You seem like the type of place that would carry pickles. They come in barrels, usually. You get barrels of pickles. Is it poop in a jar? Or is it pickles? That's true. That is a good deal, sir, and I will give you the copper. No, hold on. No, I've got copper around somewhere. Okay! Here, I pick some lint off one of the coppers that I have. But she would know if you were swindling. A what? You're such a dick. But it's usually poison you put-- Oh, can you throw a med kit in there with it, if you have any left? You have things going on. It's fine. No, it's okay. I have this pickle. I haven't tried it. I just drank the juice, but he ate it. Picklebacks! Are we prepared now to go? We didn't ask Bryce for any healing potions. I mean, there are people getting chopped up and eaten. But if you really want a cat. We might be able to go faster. You didn't die, Nott. I saved you. I'm think in the middle of a field, yes. So that it's-- Yeah. So it seems like less of a trap. And if we don't see one, then Fjord, you're the biggest. And bring people back! But then how do we get all of the ears? We're going to ask Bryce if they have a horse to spare. You need a tart? Oh, well, why didn't you say something? Hold on, let me dig. There's this one-- Hold on. I think there's a blackberry one somewhere in here. It's kind of gross; I'm sorry. I can't tell anymore. It's all black. Sorry! Should we go to the stables then? Probably. We definitely won't use it as bait for the gnolls. Okay, bye! I bet they left a lot of tracks and probably some cart things. They probably did! Oh my god! They weren't wearing any underwear, were they? But did it have holes for their butts? I'm keeping an eye out for poop. (gasps) Oh no! It's a one? If we're sitting in the cart, is the grass taller than us or is it way lower than us? If I stand up in the cart as we go, can I see out into the grass? 19! I'm flying! I'm flying, Jack! (gasps) There's carts! I see the carts! I jump up and down in her hands. Oh, are there people in the carts? Can I see? They're empty! Maybe. Should we pull the cart over and sneak up? Okay. Let's pull the cart over and hide it in the grass. Oh, but our horses. What if they get eaten? But how are we going to get all the people back if we don't have horses to pull the cart? I heard a groan. I'm going to-- does anybody have to sneeze? TRAVIS and Anybody feel like they need to-- Because... Bless you! I give you Blessing of the Trickster. You have advantage on stealth. We're hiding it in the tall grass. What was our loose plan? We didn't see any of them? But we won't be able to pull the cart. I'm really strong, but I don't know if I can carry that many people. I am really strong, though. That's not normally how you test strength. Towards the three carts? Me! 13. I get some grass and I put it on the cart. Yeah, do it, do it! Ten minutes. Okay. But what is the order of the line? Ten. (whispers) We should kill them! Sure. Yeah, I'm going to hide. I use Sacred Flame on the one next it. It just has to make a dex save of over 13. Yay. Then he gets four more damage, radiant. You need to not use that dice for the rest of the night. Everybody but Beau, you were missing like crazy on that one. Hey, look! We can use this hyena meat as bait! Toss them into the grass, then, to get them out of view? Okay, I'll pick them up and throw them as far as I can into the grass. Thank you! Hey, what happened to the little bunny, though? I'm going to look for the little white rabbit. That's really sad, they ate it. It looks like how we put the stuff over the cart. That's way smarter that what we did. It could fit in a backpack. Maybe roll up. Throw it on the cart as we're leaving. Like in Skyrim, just wheels of cheese. All the cheese. Well, but what if it alerts a lot of the gnolls, and then we don't have the element of surprise at all anymore? It doesn't look that bad to me. What does that mean? Is that where "the Brave" comes from? Oh my god, this is awesome. Yeah, you won't be able to see anything through it. It's like those birds that hit our windows at home. I'm gonna bless you before you go. So you can be sneakier. Are we going in? Oh, okay. Just tickle his balls. Oh no, you didn't see that? Good! Phew! Are you stealthed? Guiding Bolt on the one closest to me. 21. Six, nine, ten. Ten points. Oh, wow, I understood that. It was scary. Oh yeah, that's the thing! It stays up super good. (singsong) I cut off the ears. Our pickle jar-- MATT and Ooh, what are all these bags in here? Yeah! I didn't even react to it, he had to point it out. Do I get advantage because they're helping? That is not as good. Investigation. 11. We should write this stuff down. Is it metal, did you say? With wax? Well, I have it. Then the water-- A water jug and an ale jug. Oh, so I can't carry that with me? They're big? It's hooded, so you can close off the light. Yeah, I found a small rod and a crowbar and a sledgehammer. Is it heavy? Oh shit. Give me my pencil, though. No! Can I put the sledgehammer on my back? My shield? Oh, can you do that? I can look for them. Well, what did that one look like that you got hit with before? Maybe look for ropes crossing the ground. Which one are we going down, though? There's two entrances, aren't there? You should actually stealth, though, this time, okay? You have a blessing. With advantage. I was going to say left. I knew. Do either of the two paths have more tracks coming in and out of them? Let's go down the right one. No. I agree. Unless they want us to think it's the path that they've trapped. That's right, and it's actually the path that is least resistance. We're stealthing! The right. We were stealthing, we were stealthing. Okay. Yeah, I can see in the dark, I'll look. 11. No, he has advantage now, sorry. 15. Oh no. (whisper) Should we stop this? Should we kill them all? The big mama jama? While that's happening, I'm going to cast, very quietly, Cure Wounds on Nott next to me, because I saw you're bleeding, yo. You just regained nine hit points. Yay. Yeah. Let's kill them! But they're little. The hyenas are little. Oh, one's an archer, two's an archer, three's an archer. Shit, four's an archer. Oh! Wouldn't that be really loud? Wouldn't that draw them back, though? It might bring the whole thing down on us. Yeah, definitely. I feel like we should do that when we're leaving. We shouldn't do that before we go in. Because we're not going to be able to get to anything. Well yeah, but this is very loud. It would draw things up here. We can try attacking them, and if it gets bad, then we use the TNT. No, TNT. Get a surprise round. We can get a surprise round on all of them. No, you still have Blessing. While he's doing it, I'm getting ready. I'm doing this. I'm going to cast Mirror Image of myself. Mirror Image. Suddenly, there are three me's around myself. Are you casting Blur or Mirror Image? I want to know for my own sake. I cast Spiritual Weapon above the two gnolls directly in front of me. Range on that is 60 feet. Yeah, right there. It's going to giant lollipop down and smack one of them in the face. This one. The one on your left. Ooh, 19 plus whatever! That is nine force damage, and that's my bonus. Then I can do a cantrip. For my action, I'm going to cast Sacred Flame at the same dude. He saves, so is it half, or--? Yes. "Must succeed," so it probably doesn't do anything. Can I run down the steps and hide behind a barrel like it's going to make any fucking difference at all? No, I aimed at the other one. Nah, you're fine. That is so sad. 13. "Hyneas!" He looks so stupid. Did you go, Beau? Do you want my dice bag? Okay. Have any of them been hurt yet? Okay. I'm going to move my Spiritual Weapon over to the one on the ground, directly in front of Beau. Oh, I meant on the lower level. Yeah, and it's going to hit him! Whoa. 16 plus five. That's nine points of force damage. And then I'm going to use Toll The Dead on the one in front of Beau. He has to roll a wisdom saving throw. 60 feet. Yeah! So he takes 1d12 necrotic damage! Two. It's a little bell this time. I'm picturing the flat kind, so it can whack. I'm going to stay right there. And then I make my mirror images be like-- I guess they're doing that because I'm doing that because they're my mirror images. Oh jeez, there's a lot of them. That's a bigger one, it looks like. That is the coolest spell ever. Couldn't you have attacked with your offhand first? Oh man, Caleb, so rough tonight. I say, "Don't laugh at my friend!" and I'm going to send my lollipop over and hit it in the face. I don't know if it's going to hit it. Eight plus five. Toll the Dead! Yay! Okay, seven. It's pretty cool. I'm going to hang out where I am. We got to get that last gnoll before he leaves the room. I'm glad we still get shitty jokes. Oh, so it can't get up and move. I like that your revenge hits are always really high. That's twice now that they've laughed at you and you've hit them while they're laughing at you. I'm going to skip over across the upper level towards the far stairs so I can see it. I'm going to send my Spiritual Weapon over to it and smack it flat on the ground! Jesus Christ, I don't think either of them hit. 13 and lower. Then I'm going to Toll the Dead. Wisdom. Jesus fucking Christ. (laughter) I'm going to sit down on the ground and-- all my Mirror Images do the exact same thing. You're terrible. I go around and I collect the gnoll ears and I put them in the jar. I have a question. How similar do hyena ears look to gnoll ears? What if we said they were baby gnolls? I'm going to cut them off just to be safe. Whoa! I need them. I could probably use those. Can I look at them since I'm proficient in medicine? Oh, sorry. I was writing down gnoll sets of ears. It's an action you said? What was the question? I'm sorry. Oh sure. Yeah, I'll cast Cure Wounds on him. Yeah, Yeenoghu. Yeenogru or Yeenoghu? He did say to bring back anything we could find. We could do it now. As we move forward. Jesus. I'm pretty much out of spells now. But that's okay. What do you mean? Yeah. Oh. I don't know. It's a big weapon. Yeah, I've got a scythe. A sickle. Let's set them up like they all were making out. Yeah, yeah. Loosely prop them up like that. Did you do the-- Yeah. Okay. Let's go and be really smart and do this. Oh, no! This is what happens when we sit down and we talk. We're moving forward as quickly as possible. That's one way to get your players to move. There's babies dying. I like that our pickle jar is getting filled with little-- I'm smushing them down so that there's like-- Well, we drank all the pickle juice out of it, so, really they just kind of have a pickle stink. Well, I was saving them but then fucking Fjord asked for healing. That's what I was using, cantrips. Yay!
