No, that's terrible. Yeah. Oh, okay. Oh no. No, what did you do? Oh jeez. That is so terrifying. It looks like a ferengi from Star Trek. Aww, they're wonderful. They're real! Oh jeez, that's all-- Oh, I like that one. You asshole. The flowers are a little more bitter right now. Are none of us wearing the new shirt? Wow. Keep going, Matt. Only small, medium and 4XL are sold out right now. Everything else is still in there. The Blushing Tankard? Is that where we were going? It was a tavern. Rissa? There's a big party happening now! Wha-- Should we-- Should we party? Why? No, it's cool! (gasping) I was going to write dick! I didn't! I like this town. Because why? Oh. Lead the way! Fjord. That means that her sleight of hand is better than your perception. That's all it means. Beau, get me some too, Beau! Get me some, too. Oh, no I'm get-- (grunting) Is that for me? Beau, its beautiful! Wait, I guess it'd have to be like this. It's beautiful! I think that's smart. Would I have seen fireworks before in Nicodranas? Let's go inside! You think it's safe? I don't think it's safe. Hey Nott, have you ever been dancing before? Yeah. Okay, just making sure. I figure we're going to dance tonight. (gasps) We probably should. We should probably get Kiri involved. Come on Kiri. This place is great! I want to go try to play the piano. Yes! I've played it a little bit at home. I have a lot of really good songs that I learned when I was growing up. I'm going to sit down and try to play Chopsticks. Oh yeah, it's an eight! MATT and (poorly playing Chopsticks) Did you say she was a dwarf? I want to start playing The Entertainer. (speedily playing The Entertainer) This is a really good piano. You should be really proud it's yours. Do you have a tip jar? I really think the first couple tips should be to me because I really set up the room for you. Fabulous. Did you see? I run over and give Caleb a kiss on the cheek. Thank you, Caleb. I love that you did it. Where did Yasha go? There are four rooms. So Molly can have a room all to his own, if he really wants to, you know (clicking) (whistle). Is it allowed in other bars? I use my tail to-- I was going to smack him on the ass with my tail at the same time. I'll do the other one. It's sad, really. No, stay, play with us longer! Wait. So your dad is, what, rich or something? It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's okay if he is. What kind of stuff does he make? Can we meet him? Okay! Yes, of course, work, that's what we're doing. Oh, yes. I was really hoping you would have houses of mushrooms. Do you have any? No, I just thought Hupperdook sounded like a mushroom sort of town. I'm going to stop, though. I toss a silver. I think we can do it. We can have her stand on one shoulder each-- I'll be on my knees. Then we can do these things. Kiri can have a ribbon, and she'll do this while we do it. It's basically the same as what they just did. Every night? We should probably do that. For this, I would make an exception. How much? How much do people usually contribute? Are you a big drinker, Rissa? We can't put her to bed! Because she'll just come out of the room. Won't you, Kiri? Because there's so much noise and stuff. Yes, you are very sweet. She would come out of the room. I know her. I don't think that's a bad idea. What did she say? What did she say? That's it? Why do we need three people to watch Kiri? Kiri, are you cool with staying with Yasha for the whole night? Do you promise you won't try to leave her, and you won't try to come out and find us? I don't think it is either, Kiri! Oh, I just love her so much. You be good. Oh, that's right. Now me and Caleb will do it. You stand on our shoulders. You wave the ribbon. Have you ever danced, Caleb? (gasps) You have? I can't picture you dancing. But Caleb, we want to dance with you. We'll figure it out. You're very dexterous and I think you'll be a very good dancer. Plus, you have already lots of scarves on you, so you can do a lot of the things the people were doing. Yeah! So should we dance in the street? You know, here's the thing. He's already been with the Ruby of the Sea, so probably nothing you do could compare to that. Kind of sad, really. I know. As soon as I said it, it was really creepy. But you know what? It was just a power play, and it didn't really work out. Yeah, but people that have slept with my mom are really rich and really powerful, usually, so it's a compliment for them. Yeah, I could sit in the room and let you know if they're any good or not! Oh, that's pretty good. Have you ever paid for anybody before? Why did you give them money, though? I want to look for flowers too, then! Well, you should show me sometime, because I want to see it. We can do it when nobody's watching, okay? I'm really good at the waltz. Yeah. They taught me the same time I learned piano. So many. Lots of skills. I can paint. I'm really good at baking scones. Specifically scones. With cinnamon. I know. It's a very tough recipe, but I'm good at it. Yes. The third thing is something that I want to talk to Fjord about. Because if he's that inexperienced, then maybe he should take some lessons or something. That's true. No. It really was more of a learning sort of thing. Yes. It's all about studying. I'll go put my nose next to his nose on the glass. What are we looking for? Are there any silk flowers? I was looking for those. Yay! Shut up. 15. I hop over next to her. (gasps) I've been looking everywhere for you. Mm-hmm. You have the best flowers I've ever seen and I would like to buy some. How much is a flower? A copper apiece. I will buy-- I will buy ten flowers from you. How old are you? You are five? That's wonderful. Does your dad take good care of you? Are you a good dad? I think that-- I don't know. I wasn't counting. 13. I'll buy 13. I give her two silvers. You know, I happen to have a little girl with me who is very cool and I think she would like to play with you. Mm-hmm. She's extra special, though, so you'd have to be very nice to her. (gasps) Really? Where do you live? Because I could bring her over and you could play together tomorrow. Red brick on the base by door. I'll come see you guys tomorrow. My name is Jester. What's your name? Tara, so nice to meet you. Red brick by the door. Okay. See you! Does he seem like a nice dad? Ooh, that's good. 22 Do you want many of them? Because I just bought a bunch. Flowers? Flower? Flower? When you're performing, you have to have specific moves. Yeah. Like choreography. That's what we're talking about here. I think that will work out well. Make sure you use your scarves, though. I have that. I hit a random person with the Wand of Smiles as we walk by them. That guy knows. Ah! I don't remember. 20 gold! Oh, come on! I don't even know if I want to do that for 20 gold. Well, I've never been drunk. But maybe I'm really good at it, you don't know! I guess it will be me. I'm taking my five gold back from him, and I'm stomping upstairs. Oh, but I can work distraction. I stomp back down the stairs, and I join them. Is it Tara? I give her a little money. I give her a silver. No wait, add your constitution. 12! I hop up on the table next to her and start yelling Beau! Beau! I use Thaumaturgy to make it sound like other people are chanting with me. That's a 21! Won't happen. That's a good idea. Directly in front of Valkin, we start-- (laughter) 19! I want to cast Mirror Image on myself in front of... her. What's her name? Tanya, and wiggle to make it look like her vision's starting to double. Oh no, that's bad. Yeah, that was the goal. Eight! Whoa-oa-oa. Wait, we can win money from this thing? I thought we only got tokens or something for free drinks. Aw, no, fuck it! Let's just do it without that deal! Double or nothing! Go Nott! Yeah! All my mirror images are like, yeah! Drink! You've got it Nott! Are you under Disguise Self? Woo! What? No! You got this, Nott! I'm going to cast Bless. I think it gives you advantage on saving throws. Is this a saving throw? But I cast it on you! You guys look like shit. There are, yes. Is there money involved here? I take five because I gave Molly five. We do have an extra room. Do you guys need to go to bed or something? You sound pretty normal, actually, Nott. I'm going to ask Caleb to waltz with me. Astrid? Oh, well, you know, Caleb-- Caleb, do you need to go to sleep? No, no, no! I grab his jacket. You are not going to go pass out in the street. You told me to be in charge of this. I walk him upstairs and makes sure he gets in bed. Yes, I am, and you are very nice and a little stinky. I'm sure Astrid loves you very much. I tuck him in. She tried to shave her. Sober! I'm doing ribbon dances in the bedroom. What? Your money is gone? Is my money still on me? I still have my money. What happened to yours? You should really spread it out, Beau! That's really not good! Should we go looking for it? Maybe you dropped it under the bed. Can I start looking around the room? 16. I think somebody might have taken it from you. Oh no. I wonder if that's a common thing when people get drunk like that. Irena? Hey! I knock on the doors really loud. Check your coin purses! (groaning) What about Caleb? Does Caleb have his money? What about your diamond? Me? Why would I steal your money? That is really dumb. So it had to be somebody that seems inconspicuous, walking around the room and stealing people's money! Kiri? I think she'd be noticeable downstairs taking people's money. I might be able to help us. Also, there was this little girl who seemed really sweet, but she was walking around inconspicuously throughout the room, and maybe she did it. Maybe we should ask Irena if it happens often when these things go on. Oh, yes. I have a spell that can locate objects. Well, I could locate potentially a money purse. It's on this wand, yes! It was only the five who got stupid drunk. We should find out if Blemmy's crew also got stolen from. Do we remember if Blemmy's crew hung around the tavern afterwards? Okay. I still have money. It has to be within a thousand feet, and it only lasts for ten minutes. A thousand. Which is not that far. What if I cast Zone of Truth on Irena? But how will we know if she's telling the truth? She seems shady as fuck. Yeah, I don't like her at all. I think Fjord should do it. "The affected creature is aware of the spell." Always? We go looking for Irena. I think she did it. Rissa did it. TRAVIS and We should get them at the same table and ask them questions, because they have to be within 15 feet of me. Oh, good point. With my money. I'll buy you guys breakfast. (singing) Irena! Irena, did you see anybody taking all of our money last night? Does it happen all the time when people do this drinking game? Wait, what did you guys do with our cart? Would you have woken up in your drunken stupor? Yeah, we go look at the cart. Is it still there and protected? Should've left our money in the cart. I'm going back in the tavern. Irena, what about the little girl? There's a little girl that was walking around last night that was asking for money and stuff. She doesn't steal things? I'm going to cast Zone of Truth. Charisma... 15. What are you talking about? Oh, I don't think you need to do that. I'm just, you know, curious about what happened last night, if you have ever seen any shady figures in here. Do you know of anyone who would've stolen coins from people? Did you steal the money? I'm just checking. Do you know who stole our money? Hey Rissa, come here for a second! Was anyone friendly with you guys? Rissa, come here! Snip his-- No seriously though, what was this? Why is this having sex? Stop it. Rissa! Do you know of anyone who steals money from drunk people? Did you see anyone taking our friends' money last night? Ooh, good call. Man. Do we have any other questions to ask? Who are you all attracted to. Do you guys like me? Yeah, because you were standing next to me anyway. Who are you attracted to? Do you like me? Are we friends? Do you really like me and stuff? Really? Yeah. Then you know. (gasps) Yeah. Because it probably blends in. Are they the same sort of shape as regular coins? That's smart. Should I cast it? She's telling the truth. Well, maybe if I cast Locate Object we'll find out. He was really talented, though. I mean, like, super duper. Weimar. Yeah, we'll go and I'll cast Locate Object and maybe we'll just pass by something. Pocket bacon! Before we leave, I ask Irena, who's still in the Zone of Truth, are you really interested in Fjord or are you just flirting with him because it makes you some money and stuff? Oh. Okay. Thank you. I cast Locate Object on the coins. It lasts for ten minutes. What if it's in the tavern still? I feel like we'll walk faster than the cart will go. Let's walk quickly! Aw! Probably not within a thousand feet. Cleff or Cliff? Your shop is beautiful! Do you have any little toys that Kiri would like?" Kiri is right here. She's a little girl. She's very talented. Do you like it? How much is that? Three gold pieces. I think that's worth it, Kiri. Okay. Three gold pieces. (distorted) Whoa! I don't know, it sounded like a cow, or like a manatee was at the table, I don't know. Whoa! How much is it? Whoa, that is a lot of gold. Did it kill people? We could destroy it. And then you could give us the crossbow. We're really strong. All of our money was stolen. All of their money was stolen. I was sober. Thank you. It was a choice, you know. Everybody else was like, "Let's get drunk!" and I was like, "That "is really bad and I should probably stay sober." Yeah, he was just talking about us. You're still drunk, aren't you? Vampires, zombies? I don't think so. Okay okay okay. Steelbringer's Forge? They're only a couple blocks away? Should I try casting it again? Yeah, and the fact that you know him is really cool, too. Anyway. I use Thaumaturgy to make it sound like whispers of Infernal all around them. Oh hi! They might have been party to a crime, we don't know. We're investigators. At all. You know where Ol' Blemmy is from? Whoa! Oh no. You guys, you guys. They're going to get fired. I do. Oh god, guys! Thank you. The little girl that was asking for money. Why? You're right, that's true, we did do that. I saw her. But I did not ask her name. I gave her silver! I don't. But I do draw dicks on a lot of my money. But I don't think I did it to those. Well, I have really good paint, you know. Yeah. That was a lot of money! That, too. No, wait, because they didn't steal my money. I have a whole pouch full of money, you guys, right here. Big pouch. (singing to tune of Silver Bells) Silver Falls... Dr. Seuss meets-- You said the waterfall goes up a thousand feet. And the apartments don't go as high as that. So if I got in the middle of the area and cast Locate Object, it would do a really big radius. It would reach at least the top of the buildings. Okay. Should I cast Locate Object while we're walking around? Yeah. I mean, if I use up all my spells today as like, this kind of thing. I can. The drinking coins, right? Cast spell. (gasps) Ah! I turn around and start running towards it. It was Duncan! Valkin was the guy that fought Caleb. Okay, let's go. Should we just go in? I'm going to stay in the front. (whispers) Should we all go in at the same time? Oh you can't hear me; we're not Messaging together. (whispers) I'm just talking to myself. He's at the back door. We're going in! You took the money! It was the little girl! Didn't I say it right away? I said it right away! Hey. I know you, I saw you. Right? I gave you some money? You. Stole. From. Our. Friends. Not. Cool. I totally thought you were just doing the "went down the chimney." We're not going to hurt you. Just give it all back. Gail! Was it the Traveler? We can teach them the dances that we have been learning, and working on! Can I ask a shitty question? If we take the time right now to break their parents out and get that automaton, are we going to lose time on the thing for The Gentleman? Insight check. Sorry. Do I think he's lying? No they're not, they're super true! And come back? They don't even have to be that scrappy now. Okay. What are we doing? All right. Maybe we can negotiate our way into the prison and say we'll take care of the automaton, and while we're in there, we can sneak around and set the parents free. As long as we give him some notice, I think it will be okay. Ooh, good point. They got a lot of gold on them. I did pocket some of the breakfast from this morning. Yeah. Question what are we going to do with Kiri right now, if we're going down into the jail? Or with these fabulous kids right now? No, Yasha needs to come with us. We need her help. Or Kiri can stay here with these wonderful children. (gasps) Do you want to stay with them?! Oh my gosh. Children, oh, Schusters. Do you guys want to watch our little friend here as well? She's like you, though, so she's not like a pet or anything. She's a real little girl, okay? (whispers) Don't stab any of the other kids, okay? Oh! I cast Mending on the doors! Hey, we got the money back! We should definitely rest before the next part because I just used up all my 2nd-level spells. Okay. Hey!
