What's going on? I was listening in the car! It was the one? It was the one?! (South African accent) We're going to kill the big guy. Oh god! I'm in South African. Ah! (babbling) (accent still off) Yeah! Yes. Well, here's the thing, darling. I gave the other gate stone to Scanlan. Well, it would take one person off this plane. So, no, it wouldn't take anyone anywhere. Also, I heard you guys talking about the guys with the gold armor? While I was standing right here, I heard you guys talking about it? And those guys, they're guards of the city! Those imps in the gold armor, we were warned about those guys! Yeah! Well, I wanted to! But I was biting my nails really hard. I vote for-- For another day here. But if we don't find any leads, we take it. Yeah. Neither has Trinket. Maybe they should. Trinket's arms don't bend that way. Trinket, you can do it. Wait, I haven't chosen my dice yet. Just hold on, I just need like a few-- Okay. Why's all my stuff in different order? Oh-- but, wait wait wait wait. Doty's not going to get any advantage on this because he's been leaning against a door, right? Okay, good. Put your whole body into it, Trinket. Yeah! Come on, Trinket. 14. It's not a fair match, he doesn't have arm joints. He's a real bear. He's a real bear. Trinket, go pee on him. Go potty, right there. Good boy. How's that? Did that seem real enough? Oh, that smells really awful, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Well, this is Grog's room anyway. How's that going for you? Oh, but I can, I can, oh wait, I can cast Locate Object, but not people. Does it work the same way? Would a Hotis egg-ball be an object? Would a prison be an object? What about the prison door outside of Hotis' room? Well, she's her own person. It's not like she looks like any other one. Right? Hot. But the rest of us are normal, right? Because we don't have Alter Self anymore. Got it. Grog-- Oh my god! How are we-- C'mon, really?! Did you catch it? Can I roll my dice while they're reading a contract? No-- No-- No-- Nope! This is awful. Just don't do those ones. (laughs) Appropriate. (whispers) Don't whisper here. I don't know. Can we ask him? How do we know when it's evening here? Does it get dark? Of course! (nervous laughing) Of course. Does he seem to, like, notice or care that we're not the tieflings anymore? All right. Lovely. What are we trying to do? We're just going to walk around and see if we can sense where this bastion of death is. The bastion of death is what we're trying to find. So that's the prison we're looking for. Could I Locate Object on the Bastion of Flesh? Just going to keep asking. Oh. No problem! Where do you find those people? Just walking around? What? I do. Oh, this person? No, I don't know anything about-- I did see those knives, right? Yrat. Whoa, Grog. How? He's writing it down! That's amazing. Oh Grog. Yeah, you got pissed on by a bear. Who by the way-- He's back in my necklace by the way. I don't want Trinket walking around here. Wode? I guess I'm Wade And this is Greg over here. Yeah, Freddie. Yeah! What is it? What is it? Plus seven. (whispers) The ring! (whispers) No, but she does. Oh. I dunno who has it. The ring! I want to insight check him to see if he looks like he's-- I feel like he is but I just want to make sure. 26 there. Mistress, I don't believe he knows. Oh shit. Right, yeah. No, no. Thanks so much, mistress. Oh. I want to keep an eye out for all of those imps in gold. 24. Whoa. But they're not paying us special attention at all. Okay. Yeah. The chain guys. Wode. I know, is he going to know? That's true. Is he like Hotis? Could you do it at a higher level? Balls. Welp. Yeah. No! I feel like it's human remains, I don't know. It doesn't look appealing to me, Grog. Little by little, Grog. Is it salty? Jeez. Well, I feel like we're not getting very far in the city. Percy, you're not taking this contract. Tary, that's so kind! Are you sure you want to? I mean, I've never met a hero braver than you. Oh. Right. So, you would actually sell your soul? Then your soul would be forfeit! How about no on that? Because then we'd have to fight them. I mean, we could. Where in the contract does it say we can't kill them as soon as we release them? So, if you die in the process-- No, then your soul goes here-- But you could become one of those melty guys! I'll be one of them. So? Don't die. I'm going to go down with you. Can I insight check him? 24? Right. What was that? It was like an old woman was trying to talk to us! Mmm. Okay. How many enemies are we talking about fighting, as well as him? And what sort of forces does he have? What kind of devils are we talking about? Oh my lord. No. Musel. (gasps) Oh, those little guys! Well, that sounds familiar. Of course our father would be named after a fucking imp. Sounds close e-fucking-nough. If no one sees us kill him, how will we be arrested? All right. All right. So, we should make sure after we kill this big guy not to kill anyone else that comes for us? Okay. Perfectly simple. Yeah. Wait, what? Oh wait, it's a dice tower? Ooh. Really? That's exciting. Wait, we need to prep anything? Well, what's our plan? We go in, we fucking try to stealth as much as fucking possible and kill a fucking pit fiend. How did we do it-- Wait, wait, wait. Let's just remember, how did we do it last time? Was he weak to anything that we remember? Nothing? Oh, so definitely do a Feast? Yeah, but we won't be when we go to fight him. No, but-- So if we rest-- All that thinking. Are the beds painfully hot? Okay. The whole experience. At advantage though, right? Because of the Heroes' Feast. 11. Yeah. I mean yeah, we have a lot of stuff in the bag of colding. No souls in the bag of colding, but we do have-- We do have half a thing of boar meat and some grain. Just some random grain. Which I think is like oatmeal oats, maybe. All water here is hot. I'm going to sit the boar meat down on the ground and cook it a little bit. Yeah, make some grill marks on that thing. Or eating souls. Did that use up all of the boar meat? Or am I down to like a quarter of a boar meat now? Half a boar meat. I have no idea what that means. It's gone? Damn it. Oh, that's the worst eraser. It just made a pink smudge across the page. That's the worst. No, this one's good. Look at us using rations! Downstairs, I assume. Don't make a scene, either. It's important. Just be as cool and calm as possible. Good acting. He did. It's Vasa. The Whisperers you speak of. Do they see through illusions? All right. Okay. I feel like a good idea would be to just-- Yeah. But I mean, can't we just Alter Selves into little bugs or something, and get in behind him? Surprise him? And Vasa could get us into the keep? As insects? Could be good. A spell. But it's a surprise attack. And then pop out and attack him, right from bugness. I liked it. We can't be insects? Are those beasts? Yeah, are there any other creatures here that are small that go unseen? The size of rats or birds of some sort? Well, shit. Oh, right. Poor little burning rats. Fuck it. I was just thinking it was a thing, but forget it. Yes, let's do it. He talks? Yeah, I cast Pass Without A Trace on us. Yeah. No, add ten. 39. 22. They see through invisibility. I thought you said the Whisperers saw through invisibility? Okay. They're going to be the lookout now. 26. Freddie, you can't end up here. After I go through, stay here. I pop Trinket out, and then I reach my necklace through and say, get in. I put Trinket back in. I don't think Doty can go in there, it's only for living creatures. I can try. Get in, Doty. Nothing? No, no, no. Don't you think that's going to be noticeable? Yeah, but we're trying to be stealthy. He said take the easiest way in. Yeah. Plus you put the gauntlets on, which are good for structures, right? Great. Yeah. Good to know. Very carefully, I want to just peek in. Yeah. Dangerous things, or-- Is she dangerous? So quietly. Does she look like she belongs here? Is she naked? I go join my brother. Are you awake? Oh shit! (laughter) You've been sitting there this whole damn time? Oh shit, what if she wouldn't have been tortured if we'd gotten here earlier? Are you alive? I can cast Cure Wounds on her. I just want to know if it's safe to heal her. How did you get here? Is it safe to release you? I cast Cure Wounds on her. Let's make a deal. We let you go, you don't let anyone know we're here, and you don't try to kill us. Can I insight check her? Oh, I got the worst insight ever into her. Ten. She seems really honest. Ten. I'll cast Cure Wounds at third level. Oh, really? Oh, then, never mind. Fine. I'm trying to be nice, trying to save you a damn spell. 18, plus-- Do I add anything? 18 plus three. 21 whole points. Vax, can you help me pick these locks? I'll work on the legs if you work on the hands. Which is what? Oh. Awesome. 24. Help out? Where's your shit? Do you see anything cool there? Pike would be so happy right now, she loves torture devices. Oh shit, hide! Hide under the table! Yeah, we still have Pass Without a Trace. Oh god, oh god. Ah! Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! No! I shoot an arrow in the back of his neck. 16. No. Don't use the gun. (muffled) Don't use the gun. No. Don't use the gun. Will it do? Ooh. Yeah. Oh my god! (sings) Tova's my favorite person in the whole universe. It's like a bra, like a little bikini. Oh, no, it's getting away? We've gotta stop it, we've gotta stop it. No! Oh. Back out of the way of the door. Well, you can move out of the way of the doorway so that other people can shoot at him better, maybe, in line of sight. Just move out of the doorway! Thanks for blocking my fucking shot! All right-- Well then-- I'm going to shoot him. No! I'm going to shoot the dude, the red guy. I'm going to shoot him-- Yeah, I'm going to shoot him. Okay, the first one is a 20. (silly voice) Okay. 11-- Fucking shit. 11 plus four lightning damage and then-- Ugh! I'm going to fucking Hunter's Mark him, motherfucker, because I forgot to do it. Because I'm a fucking asshole! And the second one definitely hits him, too. (affected accent) So then I am going to-- (normal voice) Where's my damn eights? Okay, here they are. God damn it! Nine, ten, 11-- 11 plus one lightning damage, because I suck! And then four for Hunter's Mark. Was it? Sorry. Kill him, Grog! Please don't be any more people in there! Shit. Oh, god. Yeah! (Grog voice) That is death! Yeah. Make him smarter! All right. I come running forward, and as I'm running forward I bamf Trinket out of the necklace. Can I say, are we in the clear? Is everyone safe? Trinket, go after it! Which way did it go? Oh shit, he's going to try to attack it. Can he do that? All right. Fuck, he's going to jump on it. 28. I know! Yeah. Okay, first one's damage would be 14. And the second one is 26. And that's-- eight plus nine is 17. Shit. Well, that's loud. Hey buddy, try to stay quiet! I use my bonus action to hide as well. Unless letting Trinket out of the necklace, does that count as my bonus action? Keep it from getting away! Be dead, be dead. Wow. Can we be quiet now? I wonder if he knows that we're here. Why don't you just use your fucking earring? He's in the next fucking room. We should go in the room. We should get in now before he gets away. No, let's run up and get in that fucking room. Yeah, we heard some stone moving, so I think he's trying to get away. I come in, too. I think there's a door right in front of us, but yeah, we can come in the sides. I'm going to follow Taryon. No, I'm following fucking Tary. Because this is smart. I think he knows we're here. Number one, there isn't. That's right. Right, and there's nothing wrong with that. I feel like Tary, you should make a door on the other side and then we go inside. Right, I mean where Doty is standing right now, if you made a door right there. No, that door's around where Doty is standing, is around the corner. Well, Grog's going into the room right now. Oh my god. Dexterity. Oh my lord! All right, all right. Oh, jeez.
