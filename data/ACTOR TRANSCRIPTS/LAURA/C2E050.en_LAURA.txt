Oh god. Aww. Fabulous. That sounded just like Matt! That is so weird. Oh, do I! You guys may have noticed, right here, on one Sam Riegel, the beautiful Whispered One-- ooh, look at those pecs! I think the shirt enhances them. Ooh, beep-beep-beep. This is designed by Lauryn Ipsum, who also designed the cover on the artbook, if you might have noticed. That's in the store right now. I mean, is it in the store right now? Hold on, it might just be preorder. It's in the store right now! You guys, in the UK, it's going to the UK on February 21st, I think, or the end of February, something like that. Speaking of February 21st, the other thing I need to tell you about is our art prints that are on pre-order right now. Can we bring out Vox Machina? This is our beautiful-- I know! These were designed by Matteo Scalera and Moreno Dinisio, and they're phenomenal. Yeah, well, there's also-- Wait for it. No, but this one is super unique. Yeah. (gasps) The Mighty Nein! You can order these for pre-order in these kind, and also signed versions are available as well. Those are being on pre-order until February 21st at midnight, 1159pm Pacific Time, that's our time. I mean, they're gorgeous. These are on really nice art paper. You guys may remember our David Mack art prints that we did. It's similar paper. It's actually even nicer paper than it was before. Badass. Yeah. I love you, and that's what's available in the store. As well as other things, you know. Maybe. Oh, and, you know, you can go to our US shop at shop.critrole.com, and our UK shop, shop.critrole.co.uk. Dot...nothing else, that's it. Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they rise from the flames for the battles ahead. Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead. (singing) Can you answer the call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll! [fire burning] Going, like, you guys are being really stupid. Maybe it's not the smartest idea for us to do this, is all. I have 60 as well. I am decently perceptive; how about you? Oh, no! Really, Caduceus? I'll stay next to you, Fjord, in the front. Good call. I think it was going to be me and Fjord at the front. Are you perceptive? Yasha can be at the back. Will Nugget fit by Yasha? Where else will I put him, you know? Where would they stay? Okey dokey. That would be 19. Okay. I have a question, you guys. I've got this super-secret dodecahedron thingy in my bag that Yussa specifically said that we should not be bringing near anything and stuff, and now we're taking it right to the source. Do you think that's a bad idea? Right, unless they capture me and flip my bag inside out, and then they have it, yeah. I don't know. It's in my bag as well. I've got the whole setup going. Right, and we're only fighting an entire army of soldiers, so it probably won't happen that we will die. That's true. Yasha, you think it'll be nice? That's true. What's in this pocket o' cavern? Anything cool? Yeah, it's pretty. T. Top. Are there footprints on the ground? 15? How big of a trail is the worm thing? Is it like this? Is it like this? Cool! So we're fighting these guys and a giant worm creature that is ten feet in width, so he's probably kind of long. I mean, I'm not going to lie, Nott. I am a little bit nervous. Yeah. Well, yeah, remember what I did to-- Oh you weren't-- Remember when I turned that dragon into that little thing? That's what I could do to a worm, I guess. I did that to the dragon before you came in, you know, when we almost died. Good call. Yeah. Or something maybe like a sparrow or something, so it will fly away. Like a dire honey badger. Ooh, that's good, I like that, Fjord. Also, though, I can't do that until we sleep, but I don't think we're going to run into them today, right? Because they're probably really far ahead of us, because they got a two week lead? Traps, too. I wonder if there's another big pocket o' cavern coming up, or if we have to sleep in this little tunnel? Mm-hmm. Again? 17. Magical things live here, I bet. Kill it? Why would you kill it? It was so beautiful! Yeah, let's sleep in here. Is the ground covered in crystal, too? Yeah, maybe. Me too, me too! It's pretty. This is true. I agree with Fjord. Wait! I'm going to use Sending. I'm going to send a message to Yussa, and I'm going to say-- shit, I didn't have time to write it out. Hello! It's Jester. We're bringing that dodecahedron with us. We're on our way to... (whispering) I can't remember the name of the-- Xhorhas. Do you think it's dangerous? Should we not? Please respond to this message. Yeah, right? I think he's cool with it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean, unless somebody wants to keep a watch and make sure nothing comes by. Get a good night's sleep. Can you put a night light on, though, because it's really pretty. Go for it? Okay, okay, okay. 19 again. Do I see any movement in it? There's a chamber ahead of us. It sounds wet, Nott. I know. I know. I didn't think we'd have to deal with a water issue down here. There could be an underground river. I don't know. Or yeah, it could be that. Or it could be a water monster. When we approach it, I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, and we'll approach it stealthily. What do you guys think about that? Okay. We're approaching it stealthily. Add ten. Oh, what, is everybody going? 24. SAM and Plus ten? What would be above us? Yeah, where are we? We could figure out where we are. Where's the map? Yeah, but we know which direction we're going. We're under the big river then, maybe. Good point. Oh, we have to find it. I guess we should search around and see if we can find a hole in the wall. Follow their path or something? I will look for a hole in the wall. Nein! Wait, plus-- 14! Holes in the walls. I bet the rock formations in this room are amazing. That one looks like a fried egg, look at that. Do you see it? Looks like an egg on the top. Do you see? I probably should. (gasps) Oh my god, I should make this a temple to the Traveler! Yeah but think about how cool it would be if someone came down here and they were like "what's going on?" and then they find like-- Yeah, yeah, yeah! And then they like, they find it, they're going to be like "That is like, so important. I must definitely worship this guy because..." And it will at least get one person you know, added-- I don't! I'm just going to... I'm going to paint, you know, a really nice picture of the Traveler. Then I'm going to use my paint-- my special paint-- and I'm going to make a nice little figurine of the Traveler. And I'll sit it on top of the best-looking rock formation that looks like it's definitely for him. I'm going to paint like, pretty things around him like sparkles and shit. I'm going to put it on the little squat one. But then put some of the crystals that I got in my pocket, like around it. Then on the tall formation, I'm going to write "The Traveler is the tits! Worship him!" Like, vertically. They. Yeah, we all took Luck, right? We all took Luck? Oh see? Think about how-- What are those things? So wait, where are we putting the Traveler stuff? Okay. Oh, it's so cool. No! It's real bad! Oh! I didn't roll... I know! But I thought you said don't because they got a surprise... Oh no, six... Lot of twelves. I'm really distracted, you know, because I'm-- I'm painting a beautiful-- Oh my god, we're going to die. It hits me. Oh no. Maybe the next turn they will swallow us whole. Oh my god, wait, was that all just one creature attacking us or was that--? Okay. If I go unconscious right away-- This was really fun, guys. I went out doing what I love. (pained noises) Can I use my Hellish Rebuke? Okay. Is it okay? Ah, okay, okay, okay! Oh, god! 3d10 damage. (screams) Ooh, 19 points of cold damage. Oh, it's a dex save. Yes! What is that other purple thing on him? He's hexed? Woo! Okay. I'm going to turn, since that one's letting me go, and I'm going to put my hand towards the other one. I'll say Get the fuck out of my temple! I'm going to cast Banishment. Yeah. That's a charisma save. It needed a 16 save, so-- Well, he wouldn't have done that here. He'll only be gone for a little bit. We should probably get out of here. Also, kill this guy, huh? Then I turn back to the dude that's in front of me. Yeah. I can't do anything else, I don't think. Yeah, that's all I can do. I really hope you guys kill it before it gets back to its turn. Hi, Fjord! Thank you. We should leave. Not long at all. Like probably another minute or so, so run? There's not-- it's rocks. It's like beef jerky? 12. Yeah, same, I'm going too. Oh, it's back. Good. But it's got a 50-foot reach! Oh, yeah, that's right. We can shoot at it. It's not within range of Sacred Flame. Guiding Bolt! 13 points. Oh wait, I didn't roll to attack. I'm an idiot. Oh, that definitely hits. 19 plus eight. So that was 13 points. Is it within 60 feet of us yet? Toll the Dead! Bong! It's getting really close, so it's going to be able to grapple us again very soon. Yay! I need a heal! I think they were a couple, you guys. I think they've been living down here for a long time. They were this wonderful couple. (gasps) Little rock babies! Maybe that's why they were mad. Maybe the crystals we took were their rock babies. What if it was their giant baby nest, and we broke their babies out? I think we're the only two that got hurt. Then I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself as well at 2nd-level. Yeah, no joke. I don't think there's anything that would really help us down here that I could paint. Yeah, I actually do have the ability to command things, but they have to be able to understand me, and I didn't think that those rock things probably spoke our language. Well, you know, we could have said pretty please. You don't know. I could try it. Next time! Ooh! 24. Yeah, nothing can get through it anyway. I'm going to cast Sending. I'm going to cast Sending for Yeza. I'm going to say It's me again. Can you let us know if you've been on the move, or if you're staying in the same place? Are you in the tunnels still? (whispers) Shit. He's already in the city. We're not going to be able to ambush them, you guys. Yeah. That's a bad one. Eight. Sorry, guys. I rolled really well yesterday, though. (singing) 66 bottles of beer on the wall, 66 bottles of beer. (strained singing) 21 bottles of beer on the wall-- I use Thaumaturgy every time he says it to make the bing-bong noise. Same deal? I'm going to send a message to Yeza. S'me again. How long were you in these tunnels? Do you know? How do you feel? We're on the way. Your wife misses you a lot. She loves you. Shit. I thought that meant I used two, I had three left. Shit. She loves. Oh no! I just think somebody was-- he wasn't alone this time and he couldn't respond is all. Yeah! He just said "I can't" so I was like "Oh! Okay." That's all. No like, I can't talk to you he basically said, "I can't talk to you right now, I'm busy." I think he was in the middle of dinner. Yeah. It'll be okay, Nott. It'll be okay. I'm going to use a spell! Yeah! Sure, we've been making food. I can't do the spell I was going to do because I forgot I didn't have it prepared, but maybe tomorrow! Yeah, it's true. If those cone-head thingys come out again, I don't want any of you not being aware of what's happening. Oh, Beau! You know what we could do? Here, take this. I'm going to give her the smutty book that you gave me just recently. Wait, wait, wait! Read it out loud! Now we can all have entertainment while we're walking! I mean, normally it doesn't take, but-- I know! Thank you, Caleb. Do we hear anything coming from the tunnels? What were you thinking, Caduceus? I read scary books when I was little about these creatures that lived in the mountains that were see-through because they lived underground for so long, but they had really long claws and they would snatch up babies. I'm just saying maybe we should avoid them. What if it's not a miner from the top? What if it's one of the creatures that I was talking about and this is his hammer and the tunnel actually-- No, what if it's a creature that lives in the mountain and he's got a hammer and one of these tunnels leads to his village under the mountain and it's a whole village of scary people that's going to attack us as soon as we-- (whispering) To go poop, because there's not really a lot of privacy-- Wait, wait, wait. I have an idea. What if I cast Daylight? We could tie a ribbon around Frumpkin's neck, I cast Daylight on his neck, on the ribbon, and then he can see wherever he goes. Hey, that's better than that. I take a ribbon off my horn and wrap it around Frumpkin's neck. Oh, Caduceus. He can't hear us when he's doing these things. What'd you see? How big of a creature? Did it seem cute? That's a good point, Fjord. That is what we're doing. Me too. Yeah, bring him back. Yeah. Go down the little ones? Cool. I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us while we were hiding. Is that okay? Okay. Eight. Oh no. Stop them! Author extraordinaire. I cast Disguise Self and make myself look like a giant one of them. I act like I'm saying it. Also, tell them that I'm their god. Oh man, I was trying to make it look like I was talking, Caleb! Argh! His coat up. Yeah. What does it say? He sounds very intimidating right now. Yay! We can make food. Oh. Aww! Yes, little me's, we have food for you! Worship me! I am your leader! 12. Yes! We bring food for you. It's good. What about the leader-- your leader? Can I go? I came because I'm a really good friend of yours. I'm a leader here, and also I just wanted to go through with my friends? Yes! That's all of us then, huh? We can go then? Then the leader, and then we had the friends with the-- Then the guy that's hanging. That's important, too. Definitely. Yeah, I don't want them ganking our stuff. I've got my hands on our stuff the whole time. Nugget, come on! Oh yeah, question about that Did you see how many of them there were with the big worm? The guys that made a big mess? How long ago, do you know? Did it seem like a lot of people? How big was the worm? That's true, it's kind of-- They understand us. No, don't eat it! I mean, we shouldn't let it just die. I'm not going to trade Nugget, no! No. I mean, I don't want it to suffer in a cage, Caleb. (snarling) Let's open it up. SAM and Yay, it's alive. Thanks, Caleb! Yeah. They're so cute. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, and then we'll go to sleep? Mm-hmm. Good idea. Put on a show. I think they need some entertainment. Yeah. Yes! Oh, I'm feeling so tired. Also, I'm not a giant lizard anymore. I'm not a big kobold. I'm me again. That's right, I can take any form I want. Yes! I'm glad everyone worships me like they should. I walk around dramatically for a while. It's going to be so hard to find wood down here in the tunnels. Not yet, no. Oh my god. Hey, bees! A natural 20? I'm going to cast Command. At second le-- no. Yeah, second level. And try to get both of them and say, Stop it! No, both of the... Yeah, but it's still within range. Yes, wisdom saving throw. They both have to stop it! I mean... Spurt and Bex? Oh. We don't have any food. We already gave you all the food. You guys, what the fuck are you doing? You're so cute and stuff but like, don't attack us; we're really big. Yeah, no I'm going to kill them. (whispered) I'm not going to kill you, don't worry. What's a centipault? That's awesome! But not on us. Don't attack us, okay? I'm going to open my sketchbook and draw all of it. Don't worry, we'll heal you. That's really cool. Is it alive? No! Ugh! 15. No, don't beat it! Poor Pepé. Stop hitting it. Yeah. Oh hello, bees! Hi, bees. Hey Spurt, how long have you lived down here? 11 days? Except we're leading him to a really scary place, y'all. We shouldn't pull that shit out. That could be a really bad idea, Caleb. Yeah. You want to come with us? Hey, this kid thinks you're his mom. Can we see what it is? Oh no, Spurt, don't run! I love him! What are we rolling, stealth? I rolled an 11. Should I be rolling stealth checks for Nugget? How are we going to get out of here? Ooh, you know what we should do? We should mark this on the map. We could create a diversion. Hold on, let me see what kind of spells I have taken. I bet that these people are posted here because the Kryn came through. Oh yeah, you can't see the actual figure. So potentially-- Okay, I have an idea. What if, Caleb, you make your bubble then one of us just yells out to the fire giants, "Hey. We just want to pass through; we don't want to have "anything to do with you. We're just chasing down these dicks that passed through your land, "that's it." Then we hide in your bubble so that they can't attack us. Well, yeah, but what are we going to do? We can't all be invisible and they're right here. They can't get us through the bubble. You don't think they're going to have other sentries posted when they leave their post? I'm just saying in the tunnel. It's just an extra bonus of being in the tunnel and extra protection or something. Which I don't want to do. I just want to talk to them. Yes, I could do it. Yeah, can you make it look like it comes from the cave and then runs off so that it doesn't appear out of nowhere? Or the other cave maybe, no. I don't know. Or just come out of the lava. Oof. But it could also succeed against us and then we'll have to fight a giant. I think it would be better if, you know, I could Dimension Door with you, Caleb, over to the other side. And then we just keep going. We never engage with these fucks. Well, he's going to make a big distraction and then we all run. Shut up. Wait, which library was this? Yeah. Then we all run. Go the distance! Can you get that far, too? Somebody take Caleb. I'll take Yasha. Why? Yeah. She's not large. I could Blessing Of The Trickster you here and that way you're a little more stealthy as you're going. I could Polymorph someone! Into something that, you know— Yeah! That can get across! I could Polymorph. I could Polymorph you and I could Dimension Door me and Yasha. One of us needs to take Yasha, one of us needs to take Caleb. I'll take Yasha. I thought you could go farther than that, Fjord, that's not as far. Wait. How about I take Caleb the entire distance, you and Yasha bamf 90 feet and run because Caleb is squishy. Do you want to be Polymorphed? Okay, well I won't be able to Polymorph you once you're out. Do you keep your intelligence when you're polymorphed? Here, Beau. Don't take it out just let it in. Okay. I'm going to Blessing Of The Trickster you. You're still super stealthy, I don't know if it matters. What? Nugget's just going to run out and he's going to blink and blink and blink as far as he can. Yeah. He's going to be fine. It gives you advantage on stealth checks. He was so cute. Okay, what should I make you? What do you want to be? Maybe a dragonfly could be really cool. Okay. Well, if you're a dragonfly, will you remember what you're supposed to do? If you cast Polymorph-- If I were to cast it on myself, I would remember what I was doing. No, Sprinkle's in my pocket. I actually have a question, Matt. When I Dimension Door, I can take another creature. Does that mean I can't have Sprinkle on me or else I won't be able to take Caleb. Okay, I'm going to take Sprinkle off, out of my hood. Okay, Beau? Take care of Sprinkle. No, it's okay, Sprinkle. Just hold onto him when you run, okay? Don't let him get left behind. It's Sprinkle, he's my weasel. Nugget's going to blink, blink, blink. Polymorph. Polymorph. Plus, it's expecting something to come out the door. It's right at the top of your-- If you hit Spells, it'll say at the top. What is it? Is it a natural 20? Are they looking at each other? Should we-- Do we have any other thingies? Hold on! Well, should we just wait until it dies down then go? Natural 20! 20 plus four. 24. Who would attack the cow? What did Yasha roll? Hey, Caleb. Polymorph happens immediately so you can do it again. Oh, you're at the bottom. I'm going to run up, grab Caleb and Dimension Door to the other side. Nugget's going to run and starts running out and fucking blinking as well, oh my god! Oh no, he's so cute. With the-- oh, we did! You can go 30 feet? He is going straight through the lava? But there's a bridge! What? The cow gets you? Low damage to the cow. Roll three ones, three ones. You're invisible. And I blessed you. It gives you advantage on stealth. How long can you stay invisible? But with Blessing of the Trickster it might be balanced out, because you get advantage on-- Does that drop your invisibility once you're hit? Yeah, she's still invisible. Big fire giants, they are really-- Sure. Yes, I am going to. Yeah, I'm going to just pop my head and out and see what's happening. And I'm going to cast... Jesus. Fuck. Okay I'm not concentrating anymore. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity. I'm going to send my duplicate 30 feet in front of me. And then I'm going to make her run out and leap over the lava and land on the other side. And then she's going to act like she's readying for the fight and getting ready to cast something. Okay. God fucking dammit. Seven. You don't know where Nott went. You could prep a healing for when you see Nott. Saving throw. If she would have rolled a one, would she be in the lava? No. Can you leap on the crumbled bridge parts? Lava fire damage is what you're looking up right now? I remember this being ludicrously horrible. And that was before we did the full lava damage. Yeah. I got a better plan. Do you have the ability to roll back time? Okay. Yeah! I'm going to run up with my duplicate and cast Inflict Wounds at 3rd-level. Just kick him! 17 plus eight. 25! 5d10! Oh! 30?! (counting) 36 points. That's-- yeah. I mean, that's all I could do. Or-- no, that was my action. Heal Nott or put the fire out or something. You guys can put the fire out on Nott at least. Oh my goodness gracious. That was lovely. Also, poster and prints in the store now. Art prints. I'm still talking like Jester and we still have our awesome shirt.
