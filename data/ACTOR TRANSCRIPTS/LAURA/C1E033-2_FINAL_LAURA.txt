You can do it, Scanlan! (laughs) Oh gosh. I guess I shoot him. Can I see him to shoot him? And I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. And then I'm going to shoot him. Oh gosh, I'm just so nervous about picking the 20. No. 19? Shit. 24. Okay. Well, maybe. 18. What's up, bitches? Oh, Trinket is still running after her, too. Oh. (laughs) Okay, is it his smelling? I'm rolling a big dice for Trinket! Oh, that's good. 26! 25. Except wait. Hold on, I get advantage because he's got advantage on smell perception. Oh, it's the same thing. I should have Hunter's Marked her. (sighs) What the fuck?! Roll for contact there? I leave the room and look for Trinket. He saw it happen! He's got really good vision. Oh yeah, that's like 24. Can he cannonball into her? To try to catch her? All right. I whistle at Trinket to get him to stop. We need to find the Briarwoods. Can I loot him first? I mean, just see what's on him. Wait. Let me see what's on him, first. 24. I take them. Does anybody have magic? Can you see what these are? Look at these, Scanlan. No, wait. Give me that. I take it. Okay. Evidence is what that is! Oh! Where did she get Jarl from? Oh, "we are." Who is he? (gasps) Oh, motherfucker! He's a spy. Oh no. Holy moly. Like you do. Bacon? Good to know, Scanlan. All right. Can we expect any more traps that you're aware of? Do you want it? Just in case yours misfires? Wait, where did you get it? I had it in my belt. I have it. This music is awful as you're checking. Giving him a loaded gun? Can I insight check her to see if she's telling the truth? 24. Okay. That's good. I take that pistol back from you. We don't have that? It has to be attuned over a short rest, though. Give it some time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. What is Lady Briarwood? The guy that they're trying to bring back. (gasps) (whispering) What if it's the guy in Percy? Percy's smoke monster. What is Trinket? And he's wearing little circle glasses. Are we going in to fight now? I'm stealthing. Should I cast Pass Without a Trace? Yeah, I'm going to use Pass Without a Trace, because I don't have a lot of 2nd-level spells. Yeah, plus ten to your stealth. Yeah. Natural 20! Oh, natural 20. That's 29, that's 39. 39 for me. How do you know it's him? This is really creepy because it's brother and sister talking to each other right now. It looks like Percival and Cassandra. He will be. No, you can't have it. Because I want it. He's got his flaming war hammer. I'm going to perception ahead, so I'll be towards the front. He's going to stay further back. Trinket's staying close to Scanlan. Oh no. She's so drunk. (make snatching noises) I don't remember. It wasn't very good. Trained in arcana? How do you know if you're trained in arcana? Oh. That's it? I wonder if this was holding that acid. Do I see any recent tracks around here? Does it look like people came down here? 13. It looks like there's some tracks here, but I don't know what it's saying. They're already open and empty. 11. With a different dice? Ridiculous. Yeah. We need to go. Oh, he's taken over her body? We're all immune to fear because of the feast. Is this charm? We're going to die! (muffled) We don't even have a cleric with us! What? You have to roll initiative to see when you attack all of us. 13. We don't have a cleric! He cast Turn Undead. We don't have that. Yeah. Magic glove. Yeah, you did. I feel really inspired. It's just your little staff? All right. Oh god! Am I close by him? I'm right next to him? Oh no! I back away from him. He's going to get an attack on me. But I really needed to put some distance there. Wait! Okay, that's good. You don't hit me! I'm going to have Trinket-- is he lined up with anybody? He can't cannonball through to Grog and Keyleth? Can you dodge, Scanlan? Right! You deserve it. He's doing it. Halved? Eight plus 16 is 24. Okay, so Keyleth is 24. Scanlan is 18. And Grog is 18. No, Grog is 20. I don't know what to roll for cannonball damage because I've never actually gotten to hit. Okay. For each person? Oh, okay, so ten for Keyleth. Seven plus four is 11 for Scanlan. Oh, less for Grog. Eight. And while he's doing-- I don't get to shoot an arrow. Yes, I do! I get to shoot an arrow. I'm going to shoot an arrow as Trinket is hitting Grog. Oh god. 14 doesn't hit him. And now Trinket is close to me, then. Did he go through them and get back to me? Shit. Shit. Doesn't hit. Grog! Grog, no. No! The first one didn't hit, so you only get the 20. Oh, yeah, because she cast-- That's why I'm superstitious about my dice. He also touched mine, and I rolled a three. I like that you're violent instead of just going, "Healing hand." You go, "fuck you!" Yeah. You have a constitution saving throw of eight. Trinket rolled an 11. Get them unconscious so they come out. But then if they're unconscious, the ghosts come out and they could possess us. And I'm in a fight with Grog. Okay. This is totally awesome. She's not doing anything. I just thought she was being a bitch. Trinket runs forward and tries to pull Grog's focus so that I can back away. He tries to grapple him, or something. Can he do anything to make Grog not be able to attack me if I run away? Can he try to knock him down, or something? Jump up on his back and knock him over. Okay. Yeah, no problem. An athletics check for me? Okay. 12? I'm going to try to roll out of the way. I'm going to try to duck down and roll out of the way to make him less likely to hit me. Okay. Oh, my dice suck tonight! That's good! Acrobatics. 28. As my bonus action, I'm going to cast-- Right? I don't want to use any of my shit! I can't, but that's a really good idea. For my bonus action, I'm going to go, help! Oh. No. Yay! Oh, she's a rogue. Oh, right. Percy's still-- I mean, not badly, but-- I see the ghost come out of her? Okay, I'm going to shoot it with my Blazing Bowstring. 16? 17. I want a good one. 17. 25. For my second attack, I'm going to attack Percy. Can I see him? All right, I'm going to do it. 21. 16. That was also through my Blazing Bowstring. Yeah. Plus another five. That was another five burning damage. How do we even know who's who? It was. It's a magic war hammer. Good times. Oh no! He rolled a crit? Oh, jeez Louise! The "west" of the way? What if we take a short rest? Yeah, we can roll some hit dice. That was insane. Well, we're about to, I think. We need to keep going. We need to press on. Oh man! We're taking a whole week off from this. We really need a cleric. Oh, man. Right. Giveaways. The whole time. Yeah. Oh wow, that's great! No, there's another one before. Oh. So yeah, we can't do Critmas next week. I mean, on the 3rd. December 3rd? Can't we just do it the second week? It's going to be a long episode. We'll have to cut it super short. It's going to be really hard to do it on the 3rd.
