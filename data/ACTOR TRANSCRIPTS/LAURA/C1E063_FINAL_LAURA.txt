Yeah. Ahh, totally. Don't say 'seemingly'. Don't say 'seemingly'. Yeah. Yeah. Garmelie? The hag, right? Yeah, no, he warned us about... I am not feeling the hag. The Hut of Wodenna. It could be. Garmelie's gone. However, she is aware of our presence, now, isn't she? Yeah, we know, we know that is not where the bow is. I know, it's so terrible! I want to like explore everything here because-- Forsythia... Yeah. Kind of like when I dove into the river. Right, true. No, we don't, we really don't. Yes, you do. And we've been do-si-doing the whole time we've been having this conversation, definitely. I think we need to not go towards the hut. To the tree, to scariness. This is that time. He does. He has, he has one time. Don't. Let's just sneakily go off and just not pay any more attention to this charming little tree. This is true. Ugh. Stealthily walk away from the hut. Do we still have Pass Without a Trace going, or do I need--no, it dropped, it dropped. Because we fought something, so I would need to cast it again. Which I do! Cast again. Pass Without a Trace. Um, maybe Dust of Tracelessness behind us so the hag doesn't feel tempted to maybe follow in our footsteps. Grog, please, flower-girl, please. You're terrible. That's terrible. Soon! We just killed the crocodile plant. We just killed a crocodile plant. Seriously, we just fought something. Just did that. Let's walk away. Oh, high hopes! Pass Without a Trace, I cast Pass Without a Trace. Did you get a 20, did you get a 20 on it? Aw. Oh, come on. (All laugh.) They are. There's no excuse now. I think it's just a curse on you, Marisha. No, we used Pass Without a Trace, though, so add ten. 36. Pike! No. Can we see if the door shut? Did the door shut? Um. 25. Okay. No, that's... No! She didn't get, like, stolen or something? Away? Maybe the hag cast a Dispell she did on the broom? Love you, Pike. Definitely something you said. Seriously? Okay, so she's... That's good. Keyleth, what direction was the big scary blight on the land? So we head that direction. Keep an eye out for anything moving. Shit. Anything seemingly aggressive. It went away. That's a lot, coming from Grog. It's good, you can keep an eye out for the hag following behind us. Yes. I am tracking a little bit ahead of them. What did it look like? Just movement? (mouthing) We should go, we should go that way. Percy, look over there with your eyesight, look through your little scope and see what you see. Oh. (whispering) We need to be very quiet. Oh! So we've killed them before, that's good to know. They were-- Yeah. Just... you know, maybe go around? What do you think? Well, there's two of them that we see. Didn't, wait-- Didn't Tiberius turn into a lady-troll? Oh. They could be smarter. They could be, like, hag trolls, which is just terrifying. Which could be us very soon. We need to keep moving. The longer we stand still, the more stuck we get. Well, how about we don't move at all right now? Can we get up in the trees? Can we try and climb the trees? Well no, we can go from tree branch to tree branch. Are they tightly enough connected that we can travel on the top of the trees? I'm gonna get on the broom and fly up. I wanted to... yeah, sure, I'll break the canopy. Oh, shit. Why didn't I go above the canopy before? Wow. Okay. I say, I see the tree! And I come back down into the canopy. Can I come down and grab... Keyleth? And lift her up into the tree too? You're not gonna go up in the tree? I don't know. Yeah, I think so. I feel like the trolls are gonna pop up, like, somewhere near us. You're against the tree. While that's going on, can I fly down and get Percy out of the muck and bring him up into the tree? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. What the fuck! I should get Scanlan... Grog, get in the tree, get in the tree. Tree. Please. Aw. Seriously? Gorillas are pretty fucking smart. I think they'd be smarter than Grog. They can learn sign language, they have, like, an entire, yeah. Oh! Shit. Scanlan, do you want to ride on Grog's back still, or do you want to come up in the tree? Can I go down and grab Scanlan and put him on the broom with me? Okay. Yeah, yeah. No wings for you. Yeah, yeah. Again? Yes. Yeah, that worked really well last time. Totally. Somebody can. He had the carpet before, so. Maybe not so much, but the whole point was for the trolls to not have us on the ground, the trolls, but. Can we just try to travel amongst the trees? Yes. Shit. Do you wanna carry Scanlan? I feel like we could-- Yeah. That's true, and your wings are much larger than hers were. Yeah. And I've got a skinny little broom, so I'm not flapping any wings. Yes, well. (Marisha laughs.) Then I guess I can take one of you on the broom with me. Do you wanna hop on this, since you have no flight? Brother? All right, he's on the broom with me. Not parkouring, not parkouring through the treetops. Oh. Oh. Okay. Do we wanna go straight for the tree now, or do we wanna like rest up before we do that? Watch it and see what's going on with it? Before we just go straight to it? Yeah. Yeah. That's a long time. All right. Oh jeez, around the tree? Around it? I wanna kind of perch on top of a tree nearby and just kind of see it from there. Like bleeding out oil. Mm, sounds tasty. Can-- -- we see any kind of movement, any kind of things moving around the tree? Okay. That would be 30. Oh, shit. I think the tree is alive and not in a normal plant sort of way. Yeah. Fuck, I do not wanna get close to that thing. God, I hope so. Thanks, Scanlan. Your eyes, your eyes... Ugh! No! What? The base of the fucking tree? No fucking way, don't do that. Yeah. Can we see him walking towards it? Fuck. Percy? Are you on the ground? Do you see any sort of animal life around the tree? The only thing I've seen is actual branches moving like arms. I think the tree's alive. Like the trolls. Do you guys think maybe we should, um. We should get in the mansion and have a nice little chat and figure out what the fuck we're gonna do? Yeah? About how long, though? You wanna fly down? We fly down, I take the broom and try to find a log. All right. (laughs) Yeah. That's interesting. I got fifteen. Yeah, okay. All right. Hi Grog. Gross! Come on. So foul. (singing) Mansion it up! Swamp shoes? So you can walk like me? That's good. Oh. I feel like, is it bad? Do we get any kind of bad vibe, bad energy off the muck? No, but I mean, what if it makes us sad to be around it? Nineteen. Nineteen. Okay. Stanky-stank. Swan dive? We're in the tree tops. Shit. Trees, you're so lovely, even though you're covered in this black stuff, I can tell that you have really good personalities. Shit! I push off, we're flying, we're hovering. What about you, Grog? Oh no. Oh my god, you rolled 19 twice in a row. Oh, okay. Oh no. Oh no! Can we drop the endless rope down, say, hey, grab on. And try to yank 'em back up into the tree. Oh, I was on the broom. I've been on the broom, yeah, I don't wanna stand on anything. Can I tie the rope off on a branch? We just need to get in the fucking mansion. Yeah, we should-- Should one of us lick it? Ew! Do you feel evil? More than usual? Okay. Hold out your hand, then. Well, I have a seat, sorry I didn't think about. I'm gonna come out of the door with you. Oh, wow. That's three inspirations you've just given him. I feel like, Keyleth, a swan dive is maybe not the best idea because I feel like it'll make a lot of noise. Maybe nice and quiet. Short rest right now so Keyleth can go into the muck. I'm gonna go outside with her and just hover on the broom to keep an eye. Do you wanna hang out on the broom with me? Wow, Grog's getting aggressive. Oh, smart. Smart. Do you wanna check on that? All right. Scanlan, do you wanna actually sit on my lap so you don't have to suffer through the indignity that Vax just did? Whatever you want, darling. You're earth elemental? I'm gonna hand Vax the endless rope and say, you might just wanna drop that down to the muck so she can get out if she needs it. Maybe. Like fish for her. To the tree, you're going to the tree? Yeah, before she went in, yeah yeah yeah. Are you okay? Oh, right. Cool. Awesome. Did you see any creatures around? Do you wanna go, maybe? Okay. Grog! Because you're super tired. Oh, you're not an earth elemental anymore. That's too bad. Wait, do they feel pain? Go downstairs, Grog! All right, yeah. We haven't looked at the spa since we destroyed it. Oh, no! You did punch a cow. Ohh. No, I hated it when you punched the cow! No. That is awful. I leave, I can't watch, I go and look for chicken. It's still a cow, it's still a cow, don't. That's good. Awesome. Don't hit him, don't hit him! You need to rest so you can perceive things better. Oh. Natural 20. (All laugh.) Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm gonna go up to Grog and cast Cure Wounds at third level. Ten whole points of healing. We'll plan tomorrow morning. I wanna go upstairs and just open the door and keep an eye out of it for just a little bit and see what I see out the doorway. Oh, come on! Oh, um. That would be a 15. Well, at the door? How much time can I spend and still get a good rest? Oh, right. Well, how about a couple hours? 17. Disappear? I dunno. A giant werewolf eating an entire tree? The tree, like, disappeared? Oh, I bet something was sitting in the tree maybe and was keeping still. That could be it. Can I look down underneath us and see if the trees are kind of staying put where we are? It seems bigger than a creature would be. Holy moly. Wow, maybe the hag can just move her hut magically whenever she wants. Do you think that's possible? But the big scary tree, that's staying still. What direction was it coming from? All right. Shit. I guess I shut the door. That's creepy. I don't know who I would talk to about that. Can I go find Keyleth, are you asleep yet? Oh. Okay. So you guys are together? Oh, look at those beautiful shoes. They're lovely. No, no, those look great. (Grog voice) Those shoes suck. Can I sit down? Oh, this is true. That was your very first-- Can I sit down and start playing with the shoes? And, um, ask, Keyleth? Do you know of anything that would cause entire trees to vanish? Well, I was staring at the door, and all of a sudden, around a space, about three trees just disappeared. No, like they dropped, and there's a hole in the canopy. Do you know of anything that would cause that? Would we have learned anything about that in our studies? Maybe just don't use them anymore. They're so nice and-- maybe just put them on display! Maybe put them in a really pretty glass case. Turn 'em into jewelry? Did it look like they dropped down, though? Or did it look like they dropped over? Yeah. So it is like oil. Sunlight and water. Not here. Might not need the same thing. Maybe it eats living creatures? And we did see those branches moving like actual limbs on a being as opposed to branches on a tree. It could be like a venus flytrap. I think that's a very viable option. Possibly. Fenthras, is that elven? I think it's already poisoned. Give it sunlight. Sunlight and water. Fresh water. (laughs) Abba music. You have honey? Can you make honey in your-- You can make fresh water in that jug, though, can't you? Maybe? I don't know. I think that could be a very scary prospect. When you talked to the trees around you, did it seem like they were actually alive, or was it all dead forest that we've been traveling through? Yeah. Maybe before we sleep. Can you talk to the nature? Are you friends with the big tree? How can we help? Oh, what if it's a big scary creature, not actually a tree? Yeah. Do you want to hang out on the broom so you don't actually step-- Well, I just don't want anybody to actually stand on a tree for very long. Right. Oh, jeez! I just send things down onto her. We're just staring out the door down at her. We aren't listening to this. (laughs) Terry. Remember, we asked if it was an actual tree, if it's an actual tree. (whispers) Who is Sondur? (gasps) Pull her out, pull her out. What do you mean, Sondur? Is that a band, what is it? Is it an elven word? That we've heard? Does it sound... I mean, what would those names mean? Right, and he's a dick, so the tree probably is too. That is how it works. Vex and Vax. Do you have a library here? Oh. We have to go to your actual bedroom? Do we have salt? Do we have lots of salt here in the mansion, Scanlan? Oh, but we can't bring it out, we can't bring it out. I don't know if 12 gallons is enough to kill a tree. Yeah, what if the-- I feel like we probably should've done some research on Fenthras before we came out here. Look in your library, I am following you to your library. Yes, that's right, that's right! Yeah, but I listened to her real hard when she was talking. Aw man, I don't think I wrote it down, I think I was just listening. Fenthras! No, that's all I wrote. I was so excited 'cause I saw it written down, but no, I didn't write. I'm sorry. I didn't write it down. Dammit. Balls. But I have a real good-- Okay, okay, okay. Shit history. 17 is what I rolled. Okay, that jogged my memory a little bit, I sort of remember. Sondur. What exactly is an archfey? Oh. Archfey. Okay. Okay. So we know how to fight the tree. Okay. Maybe we can talk to it. Maybe if we call out to him, he'll talk to us. You're so charming. Or we have to talk to him and find out, and maybe... In the morning. We're gonna talk to Sondur and see, you know, why are you acting this way? Oh no, look at his face, he looks like that is a very bad idea. Yeah yeah yeah, like how can we help you? Why are you hurting? No, no, don't even bring up the bow right now, let's just try to help him out. I mean, if we did cleanse the land, that would be a wonderful thing. The bow is a wonderful thing. I have a pretty fucking cool bow now, I don't even know if this new one's gonna be as cool. You don't even know what Mythcarver does, Titanstone Knuckles aren't advancing at all, who knows? Maybe this bow is shit and the whole point of this is so we can help people. Maybe we just think it's really cool. Yeah. Yeah, like we've heard tale and it's wonderful. We don't have bacon. Ooh. That actually sounds really good. Oh shit, I'm pretty tired, what's up? Oh, yeah. Um. Yes? I don't know. It's the weirdest thing, I never realized how much it affected me until we actually were faced with it again. It was good, standing in front of him with everyone else, wasn't it? Thank you. I mean, I can't give back the title, that would be kind of shit. Baroness, no, baroness, actually. Just a little bit cooler than before. Just a little? I won't. It's all an act, dear. I love you. Thank you. Go get some sleep. Your feathers are all ruffled. Can I go knock on Percy's door before we head downstairs, just really fast? Um. Percival? Sorry. Good morning. I forgot you're grumpy when you wake up. Look, Vax came and talked to me last night, and he actually reminded me of something that I forgot to say to you, which is thank you. Seriously. We haven't really had a moment to say anything, and... Really, what you did back in Syngorn was more than I ever expected, and honestly it's, I don't know of any other time that somebody has stuck up for me quite as much, outside of Vax. So thank you. Right. Question, though? Because I sort of realized, being a baroness of Whitestone, that I literally owe my fealty and allegiance to... you. All right. Okay. Thank you, Grand Sire de Rolo, and if there's anything you ever need in return, all you have to do is ask. It was quite wonderful. Oh. Oh, that's what... so technically we gave it to Zahra, didn't we? Okay, all right. Good, that would be very strange, wouldn't it? Only sometimes, dear. Does it have to do with the Hunt? Not... not a given. We might die today. I'm gonna get some coffee. Thanks, Grog. Uh-uh. Oh. Wait. How long does Protection Against Poison last? Oh, it's only an hour, okay, so no, I don't want to cast it yet. I do. Aren't you going to try to talk to it? I can only cast it on one person, though, Keyleth. I don't have, I'm not as good with spells as you, so if you can do it to multiple people, it might be good. (posh voice) Fancy? What? Oh, like a Fancy-- Heroes' Feast? I don't know if we have-- We should've done it last night if we were gonna do it. It's gonna be fine, we're all gonna die. How are you guys gonna go talk to him, are you just like walking to him? Yeah yeah yeah. Maybe we'll go stealth... well, can a tree see us? I dunno. Let's go stealth. Why not? And you guys can go talk to it. Oh, that's true. All right, all right, you're right. Okay. That's where, that's where the hole was! But it's not a hole anymore! That's good, that's good. 29. What the fuck? It's further away. Trees fucking moved. At least it's further away from us and not closer to us. I float on my broom. Oh no, oh no. Trinket's behind Grog. I'm on the broom, yes. Does he look miserable? Do you wanna go in the crystal? Okay. Thank you. That is a huge-ass tree. Oh, yeah. Looks kind of like a dick. Yeah, we kind of branch, we just spread out a little bit. Yeah, yeah, talk to it. Be charming. Just repeat-- What? Just straight-up. Just right in. No. No, this is so stupid. What, you're just going in? So we can all fit in. You can fit in there. Can Trinket fit through? I know, I can just put him in the crystal and then-- I'll put him in the crystal. Grog, you can do it. Turn your shoulders. Yeah, oil yourself up, real good. Oh, bother. Then me, behind him. Grog! Oh no. We are so dumb. It smells like fart? Oh, god. Oh no. Don't hit that. That would be so bad. I'm gonna smack his ass right now. Whack! No, it's /criticalrole. And it'll take you to crates. What do you mean? Sondur. No! We're trapped in the tree. (sings) Oh, Sondur... (stops singing) We're walking forward, we're walking forward. We're just stuck in a tree now. We've come to help you. I bow. Are we still pretending to like this fuck? I don't want anything you offer. You've been betrayed. Is that why you are what you are now? She? Who is she? Sondur. I understand. You want to be loved. What would you ask in return? My heart is someone else's. And I pull my bow. I release the arrow. I'm sorry, I feel so guilty about it! 25. 16. Was that bad? Should I have not attacked him? Okay. We should probably-- I call out Trinket-- I feel so guilty. He was terrible, was it mean? Okay, we're in the tree, we're in the tree. I know, he's offering terrible things, right? (laughs) Scootch-scootch. I got that one hit and that was all I got. I'm sorry. 14. He's out. Oh. I haven't brought him out yet, I haven't brought him out. Yes! What's that mean? Oh, of course. Oh, natural 20! Oh no. We gotta get a new cable, a new cable for you. Oh, okay. Oh no, it's all... That sounds better. Yeah. That's good, that's good. Oh, okay. Piercing damage... Okay. Oh no! He's like a dragon! I should've just gone evil. It's his turn now. Oh no. Wow. Lightning. Lightning? Has anybody tried electricity yet? Yes! Shit, Jesus. Both of them at me? That hits. Both hit. I'm gonna die. Okay. Is that plus one additional lightning damage, you mean? Okay, so 14 and nine? Oh, it misses. Try fire. Big guy upstairs. Santa Claus? Did it look like it actually affected him, the fire? Ten is better than nothing! Oh shit, girl! Flame on! This is pretty cool. I fell over, I was so impressed. She's going to enter inside of it. Crazy shit. That's just the rule, that's just what it says. Holy crap. Keyleth. Serious. Okay. I'm gonna step just a little bit away from that flaming tree. To the side, I'm just gonna step to the side. Yeah. I'm gonna Hunter's Mark Sondur, damn it. Aw. Oh, fuck. Motherfucker. Ah! (strained) Fuck you. Okay. I Hunter's Mark Sandor. Sandor? Sondur, Sondur. Sandor is in Game of Thrones. And then I'm going to attack him with the sky sentinel bow. (nervous noises) 17 on the first one. Natural 20 on the second one. And 19 on the third. Fucking balls mother bitch, okay, wow. So what, do I just double all my dice? 16 times two is 32, yeah? Plus seven, plus two. 41. On the first attack. And then I'll attack him again. 'Cause that was just one. Nope, I just doubled the dice. Okay, so the second one, I'm gonna attack him through the blazing bowstring. And that is a 30. Is 14 plus eight, is 22. 22 on the second. And that was with eight points of fire damage. I don't know if that matters. And for my movement, can I get on my broom for my movement? I'd have to pull it out. Right. Okay. Then I'm just gonna... I feel like anywhere I go it's danger-zone in here. I'm gonna try to hide behind that tree in the middle, but I feel like that's a bad idea. Yeah. I don't want him to be able to hit me with arrows if possible. 17. 17. So 100... no, that's just two times in a row. Wow. Oh, the other way, you were going the right way. (laughs) Dangerous nerd. Yeah, come on! Please, I hope he can get in here. He's deaf from that howl, he's definitely deaf. Oh, it's just the fucking coolest. 19 isn't a crit for him, right? Good job, Grog. Ten feet higher than he was before? Jeez. Doubled, yeah. Fuck. (gasps) Can you hit Sondur? I don't know, I don't understand that at all. Aw. Does that half it again? See, you're fine. About to die? Yeah. Like one more hit and I'm unconscious. That's good. (laughing) No. I'm ready. Oh, okay. Okay, thank you! Oh, maybe that's the key. Just like "arrgh" every time you roll it. See, that's Taliesin's secret, he's always angry. All the big ones, they just-- They're pretty but-- Why would you do that? Oh, good good good, that's good. Anything? Ow. Oh, good. 20. That's a lot of dice. Now it's my turn. Okay. I'm gonna take, can I-- I stand up. Can I take a greater healing potion? As a bonus? How much is that? Okay. 11 plus four is 15. Okay. Okay, that's good, that's good. 37, okay. Okay. I guess I will, his Hunter's Mark is still on him, right? Cool. 19 for the first. And a natural one for the second. Okay, cool. Okay, so-- I guess for my-- Jesus Christ. Fuck. I guess I'm gonna Hail of Thorns him. Right? Okay, so that's a regular attack. Oh! Right, oh, I can cast it at higher. I'm gonna cast it at a level four. Fuck it. Okay, that is... I roll a d20 and then I add what? My spell attack bonus? 27. 4d10. That's good, that's good, that's good. Oh, that's good, okay. 17 for the actual hit. And then an additional 4d10? Wow. That's awesome. Hopefully these will be good. 20 additional. I'm gonna stay where I am. But I'm gonna hold onto that tree. That hits me. He's really old, so that really means a lot to him. Fuck. Okay. Okay. I'm good. Ish. On fire damage. That was Travis hitting the side of the room. That's good, that's good. So much lumber. Any sign of umber-werewolfy-- Ukurat? Natural 20! Natural 20. Yes! Up, up, up! Look at how big they both are. No. Ohh. Boo. Do you have any other bonus, anything you can do for a bonus action? Yeah, I'd think that would piss him the fuck off. So close to where Grog was. Damn it. 20 is my armor class. 19? Cool. I'm still alive. Can I shout out, "I was wrong! Uh... you're so dreamy!" Yes! Yeah, don't use your action to-- Is that Spice Girls? Girl power healed me. I feel it. Awesome. (gasps) Spice Girls? Ooh, nice. I'm up? Uh, oh right, you're on the ground. Can I, ah, fuck. Okay. You're an asshole, Sondur. Yay! (Loud computer noise in the background.) Youuu. Fuck. I'm gonna... it's useless, I can't do anything. I know, but my heal is an action, and then I can't attack. Um. I've got, oh, I've got a superior healing potion, that's better than a greater, right? Okay. I'll use that. Okay. Oh, well, okay. Ten... 20 plus eight... 28. Okay, so I'm back at 36. Okay. I'm gonna run and duck behind Grog. Can I get to Grog? All right, I'll go to there and then I will, I'm gonna Hail of Thorns him again. Oh wait, is that-- A bonus action, okay. Then I'm gonna, so I've got two attacks on him. I'm gonna hit him with two attacks. I get another flaming bowstring, I've got one more flaming bowstring. Okay, so 23 on the second hit. 15. And then I'm gonna duck behind the tree as much as I can. Can I not use my full movement to get-- Could I have shot him before I moved? Okay okay okay. Okay. What? What? Why? He just has so much. Jeez Louise, come on, man! Saving throw? 19. Zero, but I have a +2 on all saving throws with my ring. Is this another Blight, did he cast Blight again? Motherfuck. Oh, god. No, it was halved to 20, so I'm 16. Fuck, yeah! I jump up on Grog's back. What the fuck! Oh my god. Oh, I can cast Cure Wounds on myself. I'm fine. Thank you. I was really regretting that, attacking him, I thought maybe I should've just said yes and dealt with it. I don't know, I just felt terrible. Thanks, Grog. Thanks, so did you. I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds on myself before anything else happens. As high of a level as I can, which is level three. Yeah. Thank you for joining us. You too. Well, there's still time. That was wonderful, Keyleth. Thank you. No, yeah, he was really... right? (laughs) Thank you. What? Who's this Laura you're speaking of? (All laugh.) That's okay. It's fine that you didn't hear. He said nothing about a bloody dagger. Nothing at all. Oh, Scanlan! I run over and I start pulling the vines off of him. Holy shit, Scanlan, I'm so sorry. Thank you for healing me. That was really lovely. Spice Girls is so empowering. We didn't kill the whole forest, did we? This whole tree? You see those trees over there? No no no, I see it twitching, Grog, it's definitely twitching. What? Well, I don't have it. Do you need it, Scanlan, do you think-- You did. Maybe Grog should get it, I mean, he did get the killing blow. What? That's really badass. I wanna shoot everything with it. It's kind of easy-peasy. I guess anybody could pull this. (laughs) I guess I did say-- I'm not going to shoot you. No. Oh, look at that scar, it's beautiful. You're right, we should probably get out of here, maybe. We've learned so much. What does it look like outside of the tree? Is the black muck still black mucky? Okay. Yeah, at least it's not burying the forest anymore. Let's get out of here. No no. Not. Sorry, brother, I think we have other things to attend to. And then we just shoot out of the Feywild. How about no. Oh, no. I instantly case Cure Wounds on myself again. At a level three. 13 plus eight is 25. No, that's wrong. 21. Who are you? What is he? Who is he? What is he? Is he like a god? Pfff. We go home. And we kill a dragon. Any tips? Wait, one last thing. What is this statue that you tried to steal from me? That was good, that was good, Keyleth. The hag? The hut. Oh. Artagan. (laughs) It was great fun. There's your raven feather. Nice. He was fucking cool. I really liked him. Where are we popping into? Yeah. Hold your hands up, brother, we're holding your hands. Oh. Hey! Ahh, there's the card, there's the card. He had so many things wrong. Okay, okay. +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. 1d4 lightning damage. I can declare a bramble-shot like you did. Whoa. Target takes an additional 4d8 piercing damage, plus they have to make a strength saving throw or be restrained. Whoa, this is so cool! Once per short rest, I can use an Oracle Shot. I can project my sight through my arrow that I fire from it, for up to ten minutes. My god. That's awesome. Imagine from the broom up high how far that arrow would go. And then when a creature is killed by an arrow from this weapon, a single six-foot tree grows out of their corpse. A Christmas tree. Wait, no, I wanna see what it is. I have it. Travis. I don't wanna keep it, I just wanna, I'm the one holding onto it, man. Whitestone!
