Well, your friend, Gail, is here to play that game you love. No, the one your Aunt Pam says was invented by Satanists. Have any of those things been invented yet? You didn't know! It's a joy, Matt. Maybe we can play this time. He keeps saying seemingly! He keeps saying that! That's right. We marked our places on the map, where we left last time. Are you Siff? Secrets are fun. I have a secret for you! Did you know that in Nicodranas the pastries are made with cinnamon and here they're not? (laughter) Oh no! I gave him a secret! Oh no! I thought I was helping. He's in the teleportation circle. 15. I wanted to talk! Shit balls. Hey, I just made us $100, you guys. (cheering) Run away! That was the weirdest, cutest hiccup I've ever heard! There's going to be a thing that comes out there, I think. That's what he did to Beau. You got it Yasha! Take him down! It's one hit! Maybe we can activate it. Kill that floating dude. Maybe he just flies. Maybe he's got feet and his robes cover them up. Yeah! Can you hear it? 12. We're in so much trouble! Wait, I have a question. When we're paralyzed, does that mean every attack against us is a critical? Okay, I'm done. They're making so much money tonight! He's about to. Are his robes floating around him all cool like a Nazg√ªl? That's a less shitty roll. All I'm hearing in my head is Careless Whisper now. I mean, we should take those out too. I'm going to pull out my symbol of the Traveler, and I'm going to say Okay, I hope you're with me right now, because I really need your help! I'm going to try to Turn Undead. No, I'm going to jump up behind Frumpkin. 30 feet. Wisdom save, yes. It has to make a wisdom saving throw, yes. 16 succeeds. That's my action, and for my bonus action, I'm going to cast Sanctuary on-- who's the lowest? On myself. (laughter) It was also the only wisp that wasn't affected by the Turn Undead. Where did that confetti come from? Oh, I missed your welcome party. Are you going to do your thing? All the stuff. That's a good name for it. (shouting) Steal his heart! Take his heart! Wait, don't you have to make a wisdom saving throw against my Sanctuary? Because you did a harmful spell against me, right? I didn't roll anything yet. Ten. I'm unconscious. Don't waste a healing potion on me! I have healing packs in my bag! I have doughnuts. (gasping) Molly! This is a bad day, you guys. Today is really hard. I guess I'll walk over and try to take out the pot. Can I try to throw something at it? Yeah, I don't think I have anything that will fit through that little hole-- I could try picking up a rock on the ground and throwing it at it. I probably don't see one. If I did, it would take a whole lot of time! Three! No, it's fine. I just woke up, you guys! Good job. Oh no! He's back? Okay, we run away. Grab his heart and run. From the ground. Let's run away. It's a two-handed weapon. I can't do it. I can't use two-handed weapons. Oh, his body's somewhere! Maybe there's something behind the bookcase? It's immune to fire. Can you catch fire to the bookcase? Should I try to heal Yasha, or move the bookcase? I'm the strong one. I can use my last spell. I have a 2nd-level spell. I'm going to, bonus action, use Healing Word at 2nd-level on Yasha to bring her back, and then I'm going to run over and try to crash the bookcase down. Six plus four. Ten! Can I get all the way over to the bookcase? I try to yank it over. 16. Is there anything behind it? I bet its remains are in there! Kill it! I don't think I can do anything else. Wait! We should heal, you guys. Should we take a short rest and heal up a little bit? Oh! You're welcome. You deserved it so much! You did so good! Let's see. Let me look in my possessions. I don't think I have any butter. Is it pretty? Can I look at the art? Do I know the artists? I don't know what's going on. Well, that's not as cool. Ooh, they're antique. I put them in the bag. How about that? What is it? I've got an herbalism kit. Can I use my herbalism kit to get rid of the poison? That's 21. Are there any rings? Caleb! You should see if the rings are magic. It also includes the sword and the vases. Can I try doing the Mending cantrip on it? Would that help? (singing) Le le le le le! That's still cool. Hey, that's good! Whoa. What else does it-- It's a two-handed then because it's a great-- We could use it on not-people as well? Maybe on objects? (laughter) That's how you hold a greatsword? Oh, it's dark. Is it cursed? Does it feel cursed? So Siff didn't have any feet! Do you think taking the sword off the wall was what made Siff be able to come back? Hmm. At least we're not dead, you guys! Oh! We can put them on now! They're not magic. I should get an extra one for healing you for poison, so that's two for me. I get Caleb's because he's not saying anything. That's three for me. How many is that? Seven, eight? Yasha, that's two rings left for you. Or in your nose! There has to be a hole in it for you to be able to do that. What is he writing? No! I didn't lose the page. I lost the whole spiral! Yes, well, things moved for some reason. Does anybody see a little-- Yeah, because I need it! Get evidence of something. He may let us keep some of the spoils? I bet they're worth a lot of money, though. Rich people love old things. One ring. Mine rules them all, though. I already took his ring, so technically-- Here. (singing) I have two rings now still. What about the sword? I mean, he probably can't even hold a greatsword. It's a little big for the Haversack. Not quite so much. It's only eight cubic feet. I don't think it works quite like that. It has to be a broken thing. As long as there were no ashes in it. Oh, it wasn't an herbalism kit. I'm stupid. It wasn't an herbalism kit that could heal the poison. It was medicinal herbs. That's what I had in my inventory that I remembered. I definitely start drawing that in my notebook. You can keep a dream journal. That's a good way to do it. Write it down immediately what you remember. It really helps. Are we going to tell him about the sword? Only if he notices the sword. I can try to fit it in the bag. If it pierces, it's bad. Rub some of the ash on it! Like it can be up your butt! I have some crossbow bolts, and this crowbar, and the sledgehammer-- I have this longsword. I have these old vases that we're going to give him. I have this old dodecahedron, and I open up the lead box. This is really taking up a lot of space. I start shoving it all back in. We have boom sticks? I'm listening! What? It might work, we can try to fit it. Yeah, does it have a scabbard? We should probably get one of those made. It works. It doesn't get pierced from the inside. It can only be pierced from the outside, right? Yeah. It's too big! What if I take the sledgehammer out? I'll take the sledgehammer out. Will it fit once I take the sledgehammer out? I don't think the sword is going to fucking fit. Here. He probably thinks we're dead, you guys. Oh man, we should have tried to go through that teleportation circle. Yeah, we should have tried harder. Thank you for saving me, Molly. Thank you for saving me, Fjord. I have to go in the other boat. It has been a really long day so far. Or we go check out what's farther along. Just a little bit. I feel like this is stupid. See you never. If the current starts to pick up, we're going to fight it and try to go back, yes? Yeah! Oh, I don't think it works that far away from him. Oh, that's where the fork was. It comes back together. Yeah, keep going straight ahead. We're turning back and going the other way? Constitution check? That's pretty good. 16. Oh no, there's a waterfall. Does it seem like there are any boats that are broken at the bottom of it? Is there anywhere to stop the boat? I only rolled a ten. Is the waterfall really hardcore? Could we see if there's anything behind the waterfall? I try to get closer so that she can poke through the waterfall. Should we go? Do you think it's going to bludgeon us? Oh, you're going? You're jumping now? You're not going to try to get the boat through? I try to get the boat through. I save the boat! Okay, I try to push off and not sink the boat. Jeez. Oh, much better. 21. I really want to go see what's behind the waterfall, but I don't want to lose the boat. We'll lose the boat if I jump out of the boat. Is there anything to tie the boat on? Do you see anything on the other side? It'll be like a cold peppermint drink. It'll be good. It does because I've been doing it at home. Did you find anything? (Breathy) Okay. I lift him up by his armpits. (laughter) Oh that's-- ooh. It's a good place to hide though, too. Fjord, even wet you're, like, 150? (laughter) Right. Fjord. 150? No? It's even better, right? Oh shit. I'm getting real tired, you guys-- Oh, I'm not. I'm not getting tired at all, actually. 17. Do we want to long rest or go back? LIAM and Let's camp. Just inside of the rock collapse? It is? Immediately? Then yeah, at the bottom. Right before the staircase, right inside. (singing) Because he was in the water before! Sorry, I want to bring this with me that's all. Yes, we did a long-y rest-y. Are you all wet again? No dampness? Fjord, you have a little something right here. Did you bite your lip? Is that why--? Is it a sleep thing? Is that why, well you know. (whispering) Well I don't want to say anything. I'm afraid it will offend him. (whispering) Well, most of the half-orcs I've seen have bigger tusks. (loudly) It's okay, Fjord, if you don't have a big tusk! It's not a big deal! It's totally fine! (sympathetic) Just on the tusks! Who? It really is. Do you still feel the same way about your teeth? You have to continue to do it? Is that why you have blood on your mouth? Were you filing your teeth last night? Is that nine? No way! The emotional poking was too much! The guy in Tusk Love had them. I think you would look fine either way, Fjord. I'm saying if you want to, you would look good that way as well. You look good this way, you would look good that way. I'm good. Warm blooded. Nott on the sword. (singing) Sword up the butt! (singing) Yep, straight up. (singing) Just like a puppet! If he notices it, then he notices it, if he doesn't, then he doesn't. I'm really good at lying. Let's get in the boats. Harder because there're things there. Yeah. Eyes on the side where the rock guys were. Oh no. She rolled well. This a strength check? Five! Oh, Blessing of the Trickster, sure. On you. You get advantage. 12. To be fair, I am rowing. (exaggerated Southern accent) I'm rowing a boat! (exaggerated Southern accent) That's a 13. It's because you went so fast through the other area. You have to pace yourself. We killed stuff! We are really badass! No, she said he was probably awake. Well the Moon-touched Sword, is it small enough to fit in the bag or is it--? (fake wolf whistles) Early in the morning. Yeah, so many will-o'-wisps. Did you know you just have to break a vase and you kill a will-o'-wisp? Yeah, this big cube came down from the ceiling and it tried to eat us. It's pretty scary. Oh yes! I pull out the vases. Look at these antiques! Careful, they're very old. I bet they're worth a whole of money then, huh? We found some candlesticks too. It was seven. I give one of the extra rings. Yeah, I know. 16? I think we killed everything. We see two rock creatures that were really big but they're really slow so bolt on past them and they won't be able to catch you. There were a lot of burned books. Mostly be careful walking on them. You'll see them. They're pretty obvious now. Well, there were two paths in the river, and the second path lead to a waterfall. I don't know what was at the top of the waterfall. There could be a chamber up there. I don't know. The other side lead to the thing. Is there anything else? We're the worst. We almost died. (mumbling) I could look in my bag. Do I believe him? Is that an 11 or a 17? 17? 21? Yeah, that's a 17. 21! He's being honest! We're really good at that. What a day. We have stuff to sell! Should we go do that now or should we lay low for a little bit and make sure that he doesn't have anyone following us? Let's go back to The Leaky Tap. We do have some rings to sell, I guess, if we wanted to. Did you ever look at those chains? Did you look at the mantacles? The mantacles. To see if they were magical. We should probably stop going to-- Maybe not to Pumat Sol for a little bit. I'm sure. You should probably take a bath. Nott, I know you don't like water, but this is an extreme version. I think probably at least a damp towel? Oh yeah, there was something about that. Yeah, in the Victory Pit! What happened to the children? I start yelling out The third of the Fessuran is the end of the harvest! Hide your kids! Hide your wife! There's a Victory Pit! I have a lot of rings. I should see if I can get any good money for some of them. I have some fancier rings, though, from before. That were stolen from your boss? What happened to Sean Connery? I want to scout out the Hearth of the Allhammer, the Raven's Den in the graveyard, and the Platinum House, and see if there's a lot of guards, or if there's any of those that don't have a lot of guards. Is there any one that seems emptier than other ones? Could I try to get in there when nobody's in there? Can I get in my disguise kit and affix a mustache onto her porcelain mask, and put a wig on her, and then write across the bottom of it "The Traveler was here," and leave a pamphlet? I want to see as much as I can do in that amount of time before anybody comes back. Oh no. Off to a good start. Nine. Oh hello, yes? There was a smudge on her face, and I know that the people get really pissed when there's stuff on their statues. I was trying to clean it off for you. I rub my arm across it to try and clean it off. I think I got it though! Don't worry. I'm going to sit here and worship her now. That's all. Oh, that'd be great. Does that always happen when you pray to this lady? She does. I know she does because she likes me so much because I worship her real good. You too. Shit. Damn it! Is there anything to tuck a pamphlet into? Yeah, I'll do that at least. Yes, I'm going to try some other time. Skein. I can do a medicine check. Do you want me to look at it? I mean we could poison somebody later. That would be fun. Like Legend? Can I look at the stuff? Wait, what? I'm going to follow behind and throw pebbles at them from behind. Oh no. We're following behind you guys right here. You guys looked like idiots, just so you know. We need to get Nott cleaned up, too. Yeah Nott's covered in ash. Hey, you want to see this map? You're not with me. It's over there somewhere. (whispering) Hide yo kids. I found the map, you guys! I had it somewhere safe. This is the Xhorhas side. Ooh, the Brokenveil Bluffs look scary. Are you coming onto me? Why do you have to do that? It's pink! It's mine! I paid for it! I'm not going to do anything. Do you want to hang out with me, and then you can look in the bag with me? I don't know what you're talking about. There's a lot of people that inspect their special packages. You get to know yourself real good, Caleb. Yeah. You want to look at it? Yeah, I'll hang out with you. I really want to see it, too. Then maybe I'll keep it now, and then I'll come back tomorrow night and we'll do this again. Special packages and everything like that. I leave to go on to watch them. (laughter) I'll go see you again tomorrow. I come back. Hey, okay, do you want to check this out now? (whispering) You need 50 still to send in your package. Oh! How much money did you have? Yeah, I go knocking on his door the next night. (rapidly knocking) (still knocking) Hello! (seductively) Hello Caleb. Hello Nott. Caleb and I have a date to talk about his special package. No, we're good. I open up the haversack and pull out the box. Okay. Okay. (clenching) Yes! That's probably good, because people are still looking for it probably, so it's probably stupid that we're fucking with it right now. Yes. Are you going to go all like (tonal sound) while you look at it, or are you going to be normal? Okay, cool. Totally game. Okay. I'm looking at Caleb. (laughter) Oh, okay. I've got his hand. (excitedly) Oh no! (growling) What do you do? (whispering) Lick it! Did we hear him talking? Oh shit! It means he's lucky again. Did we get it too because we were holding his hand? (whispering) Damn it. Caleb, we heard you talking, though. Are you okay? Caleb? Uno, dos, tres. Quatro. I think he seems like he's pretty okay, though. I don't know. You could read it out loud you know. If you read it out loud then we'll shut up. That's right! Then we can all be a team. We can pass it around! We could literally-- we could each of us every day pass it to a different person and then we could concentrate on it and we could have the Fragment. Why were you talking about your mom and your dad, though? (silence) You said, "Mom and Dad I hope that I make you proud--" "--and I don't disappoint you and stuff," and also, "gee whiz, I should probably take baths more often." Well you were going to say that and then the gray thing went into you. Yeah, that's what you're saying. I remember hearing that part. (laughter) If you ever want to talk about it you can just come to us! We're super good at talking, both of us! Tomorrow I want the thingy okay? You're right. I am. (gasping) Oh my gods! What if, now that the gray thing is in you, the wizards in town will be able to sense you? Maybe you should be in the lead case now. Are you sure, though? The next day the gray thing will go in someone else. Or if like you really want to put a mustache on a fucking statue. Yeah, just in case you ever wanted to do that. Your son is just the cutest. (sing-song) Okay, well goodnight then! Goodnight, Caleb-- If you need anything I'll just be in another room-- Who was it? (singing) Victory Pit! A Mote of Possibility? We'll figure it out. That was fun, you guys.
