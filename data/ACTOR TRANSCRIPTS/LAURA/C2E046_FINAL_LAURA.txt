Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they rise from the flames for the battles ahead. Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead. (singing) Can you answer the call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll! [fire burning] Hi, guys! Mostly. Yeah, that would be really nice. I know. Whose donut is this? Sweet! Keep going, guys. (mouth full) Yeah. I'm coming downstairs. Yeah. Downstairs from my upstairs cabin. I slept in the crow's nest. (heavy sigh) I'm okay. Mm-hmm. Sure. It was a lot, yes. You disappeared, Fjord. Oh, right. In the dragon room, too. I was talking about in the library, though. Yeah. Sometimes you just need to touch things. Twiggy said that the dragon is actually dead now. Lots of books. Oh, yeah. A cabinet swallowed Nott, no, Twiggy. It all kind of ran together. I did. Beau did. Yeah, it wasn't like everybody left you. You left us. You would know, right? Mm? Of course! Really, I was invisible, you guys. I wasn't there. You were in a wall, dude. That's pretty cool. I mean, partially. If I'd have done better against the dragon-- I don't need an insight check. I believe it. What, where was--? That's really-- yeah. Fjord. Ask them where they're from, all the troops. Did you already ask that? So they won't know who we are? That's more than they said when we came out. Maybe for 50 gold we could get out, though. No, that's not very good. Eight! Meatery? Oh, Meadery. You don't eat boar? Do you eat meat? Really? I haven't! No, I think I'm okay, Fjord, thank you. You keep bees here? Can I see them? How much is that? Okay. Some pastries, if you have them. (mimicking Bentha's accent) No cookies, no doughnuts? I don't want any mead; I just want the honey. Yeah! Well, she was on the boat with us. Do you want us to go to this temple? Yes, I think he feels guilty. I know. No. No, he's not. Yeah. You're from Felderwin? You're from Felderwin? What about your... you know? The Xhorhasians. That's what all these soldiers are here for; they're going to join the fight or something? What did they say, Fjord? What if we went to the temple and then headed back? No dilly-dallying, we just go and make sure that everything's okay. Are you going to try to-- what are you going to do to Uk'otoa? LAURA and Yeah, I did. (laughter) Plus, we still haven't found out about Vandran. I mean, I can message her. I've been messaging her. Okay. Some bees. I just really want to see them. I really want to talk to them. Really? You can teach me the language? Hi, bees. Okay, okay. TALIESIN and We didn't mean to be, Yasha. Yasha, we want you to be part of the group. If that dragon is dead, there's a lot of stuff. Fjord Practical? Caleb got some books. To look at some books. We almost died, Yasha. And then we really would have been dead and then we wouldn't have come back. No. There was a big blue dragon. I want to see some bees. You've got two clerics. You don't need it. Hello, bees. Whoa! Do I need to wear a thingy? Okay, but I really want to go up to them. Hello, bees? Hello, bees. Please come over here and let me say hello. I start walking very slowly. Hello, bees. I want some honey! Yeah. Yeah, but I want the honeycomb straight from the thingy! Wow! It's really good. It's like gum, but sweet. Can I have a jar of it? With the actual honeycomb in it? I want two jars. Okay. Hello, bees! Yeah! Say something! Tell them to come over here, but don't sting us. Maybe they like mushrooms. Yeah, they look like it. Not colorful mushrooms, just brown and gray and white? Maybe some black ones. Cool. Beads, or beans, or bees? Ugh, I hate that he doesn't say what it is out loud! Zeidel High, that's where Grease takes place. Caduceus knew that it was going to rain. I'm going to stand at the back of the boat. No, I just want to be able to Control Water if something happens. Depends on the storm, I guess. I'm okay. Feels like a carnival ride. Thanks, Beau. Yes. You did? You could have used the Traveler in your life, too, then. I'll tell you a secret. Sometimes I'm angry, too. It's a sight to behold! Someday I'm sure you will. That's really big, yeah. You already have a lot on your plate. I give her a hug from behind as she's walking away. Thanks, Beau. I love you, too. Okay. Would we have seen the lightning hit the ship? No, I'm upstairs. All alone? With advantage! What is she doing? What is Yasha doing? No, I want to run forward. Yasha! Do you need help? Okay! No! That looked like it hurt. Do you want to be healed? Oh, it didn't succeed. Can I heal her? I just want to heal her. Oh, I rolled really low. Six. Okay, I'm going to run up and go Keep going! You're doing great! I'm going to touch her arm and cast level three Cure Wounds. 20 points of healing. I didn't know! I was trying to help! Did I see that happen, or did it just look like a ball to me? Shit. Sorry. Have you been adding your seven points of damage, necrotic? I mean, should I do anything? I mean, I guess I'm going to back away from it, since I made it worse. Ten feet. Sorry! Didn't mean to join anything and didn't know what's going on here. Looks pretty crazy. Sentinel! Can you fly? Yasha, what do you want me to do? Ah! I back up ten more feet. Oh, that's good! Staying out of it! You can do it, Yasha! Oh my god. Oh my god. As I see her falling, I run forward to try to cast Cure Wounds right as she-- I look down at her. Are you okay? What did you do? I saw a ball of light. I saw you fall off the mast. It was a big ball of lightning stuff. Your sword fell down. Here. What did it look like? Cure Wounds. What do you think it meant? It only wanted to fight you. Yasha, this is really important. We should talk to Caduceus. Mm-hmm. He has really good insight. Plus, he makes good tea. It will make you feel better. Yasha fought a ball of lightning, but everything's okay! She's good. We're going to get some tea, though. The mast looks like it maybe got burned a little again. Why don't you stop being a dick?! I crawl up and cast Mending on the sail. By the way, you're healed 14 points. Plus, I'm one of the carpenters. I've got extra skills. Clues and clues! Clues and clues and beans and beans. Is it peaceful? (yawns) I'm so tired. Thank you, Caduceus. The Balleater. Oh, yeah! And also, our captain also eats balls! You feeling any better, Yasha? What made you leave in the first place? (background music) It had to be scary, right, if that's all you'd ever known. Why? You can say what it is; (whispering) I won't tell anyone. Whoa, that's a cool name. (gasps) You got married, Yasha? Yasha, you're not a coward. You're one of the bravest people I've ever met. What was her name? That's really beautiful. Did he heal your heart, or are you still sad? I didn't know. And then Molly. Curses and luck, they go together. If you don't believe in luck, you can't believe in being cursed either. And Molly's still with us, the same way that your beautiful wife is. (gasps) You didn't put some of that stuff in, did you? Minty people. (background music) I won't tell anyone. Thank you for trusting us with that, Yasha. Sometimes it helps to say things out loud. Really? Yeah. To minty families! Yes. Yeah! That is awesome, yeah. Do we have to go to the bottom of the ocean again? Also, it was in Avantika's journal, wasn't it? You remember, Caleb. It's possible. You don't know. You're not going to come with us again? Yeah, and we defeated her. Yeah, but we still defeated her. We got the orb! We also stole some shit. Yeah. I got at least five gold. Nott. I don't want to force you to come, of course not. You can stay up here if you want, and I'm not going to talk about dangers, and murky depths, and stuff like that. I will say that you saved my life, and I don't feel as comfortable going into a battle without you. Wait, so if I was petting Frumpkin when you were doing that, would he slowly lose his fur and grow tentacles, or would it be a poof? Okay. Come on, Frumpkin. Ugh! It's never good! Oh, no. Oh, no! We did; we got a long rest. Yeah, we still got a long rest. Ugh! Oh gosh. We're all watching you. But if he does-- Looking good. Stealth. Natural 20! Straight up, light up. Oh, I'll give you a Blessing of the Trickster. That's advantage. Natural 20. Oh, I left the weasel on the ship again. I didn't bring him with me. Yeah, I'm not going to kill my weasel. It's like the snake people on the other island. Where do we go, Fjord? I say we all attack each one until each one is dead. We don't spread it out too much. Focus on-- Yeah. Yeah. I could Invoke Duplicity down there and see if they attack us. If they do, then we can attack them. Just going for it? How spread out are they? I'll go with Beau. Yeah. Mine is also a save against dex of 15. 18. Hey! Guiding Bolt at the one coming closest. 14? Okay, 14 points of radiant damage. No, because a crossbow you don't roll at disadvantage. I've hit one of them with Guiding Bolt, and you have advantage against it. Ew. X-Files. Would it still be at disadvantage, though, on the second attack? That's my favorite combo. Use your sword! Attack the one at Beau. Okay. I'm going Toll the Dead at the one at Beau. Wisdom. 15. I'm going to stay put. Yasha, you better fucking help us. Are you raging? That was a seven. That wasn't a one. That was a seven and a four. Yeah. That's the first time I've heard Sam say "Okay, okay, okay." SAM and What is that? (exaggerated Southern accent) Careful, they spit needles. Eww. So it would be five more points of-- Toll the Dead at the same time! Ah! Doesn't save. Oh. 22 points. Of (tolling bell) damage through the water. The Toll the Dead vibrations going through the water so all of us can feel it. Go team! Can you see through its eyes like Frumpkin? There's no other entrance on the tower? Just the one? That we see? Oh, I give-- bless you! You get advantage. I'm also keeping an eye out to see if I see anything come out of the front entrance. 17 perception. What did it look like? That's weird. See if it attacks it? Sure. Yeah. What does that mean? What did that delayed reaction mean? Ugh. Are we going in the top tunnel or the bottom? Oh, attacks? Okay. All right. Follow behind him and land. Who's within 30 feet? You are. You are Nott. Yasha. Yeah. Who's within 30 feet of me? I don't think you would benefit from this. Yeah. Are we about to do this now? I'm going to Bless, taking a cue from Caduceus, on Yasha, Beau, and Fjord. That gives you a d4 to add to your attack rolls and saving throws. I'm picturing those big creatures that are in The Dark Crystal. You know what I'm talking about? Oh fuck, that's way scarier-- What date are we starting back up again? Oh man. Oh my goodness. Yeah, that's cool. Ooh, it does look like a forked tongue. What the fuck is going on? Sleep for a hundred years. I love you, guys! Love you every year together. And a Happy New Year!
