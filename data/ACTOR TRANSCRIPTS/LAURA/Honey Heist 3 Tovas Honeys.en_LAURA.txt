That's amazing! Is this like spin the bottle? Hello, who's there? Tova, I love you. Oh, Drew. You brought the crazy one. How can I help you, Tova? It's incredibly deadly. You want me to be your face? I accept this request, Tova. Whatever you want. I am happy to be on your team. I don't know where she is looking. Hello. Oh, the pipe, that's an important part of the car. I didn't even hear anyone talking to her. I like how most thieves steal things. You sneak into people's rooms and leave them fudge. I've noticed. I think I would do very well with one. I have very small fingers. It destroys the gun when it-- Better for picking berries. What is it? Zut alors, that's wonderful! Wow. Send you all the love. Oh that is-- that is a top hat. You look like a human now. How is that going to fit over your-- We will know they are there, Drew. Four. An eight. A four again. A one! Oh, it says Bailey on the inside! Thank you so much. She's really good. No. Do I look human? Do we all fit? Is there an outlet mall we can stop by on the way there? No, we probably shouldn't. Is it pouring out? We've got our Starbucks and our yoga pants. We are ready to go. We may stick out. They think they are so perfect and they are not. We should take them. I would love them. Thank you so much. Thank you. I don't see where it is. You can roll your red one again. Yay! Now it looks like a sleeping horse. You see the way that bitch was looking at me? Let's go for a stroll. I'll lead the way. Can I get advantage because I'm the face? I rolled very poorly. Failed. (growls) I thought we looked like humans! Penny. What does Penny look like? I mean, never mind, is she human or is she a bear? You are so smart! She is so smart! Then slightly to the side of your soul as well. Did you already say what color the boat is? Is it also kind of a penis color? Mm-hmm. Do humans wear burlap sacks a lot? I cannot get this fudge off these gloves. It is harder to see shapes at dusk. Do you have any tips to make us look more human? (bear growling) I was trying to say hello. Did it work? To the boats! (gasps) Type in Crispin Glover and see if it goes to him. Maybe I can seduce him. What should I try to do? All right! I step out from behind the crates. (throat clearing) (growling) I move my gloved hand down my side and turn and wiggle my booty. (growling) (growling) Oui. Oh no. I chase after him! Yes! I was going after him too. Did I make it? Did I jump to the boat before-- No, I didn't! Of course! Here it is! I found it on the floor. Bearah! Does it work still? I stand up and get ready to jump to the boat as soon as we get close enough. I leap! Goddamn it. I land in the water. I'm going to try to lift myself up so I am skiing. Woo! I'm going to start pulling myself up by the rope to get closer to the boat. I succeeded anyway. Oh, but I got a two on that one! Lower. I go to grapple his legs to help out. Oh no! Oh shit. Oh no! I want to find the shoebox. I grab the box. I grab the satchels. I grab everything that I can. We'll get our guns out, yes. Clair! Look at these satchels and this box and see what is in them! Is the balootonium in the shoebox? Are people still shooting at us? Who is it that is chasing us, then? Is it us, or is it them? (hyperventilating) I'm claustrophobic! Type in Bad Guys and see if it is them! Do you think he is betraying us all? No, you want to move a bear into criminal. Yeah, you're good. Move it to where they're even. Type in us and see if it beeps the same way. Is it in the same place as the other blips? Do any of us have a saw? Oh! Put on the glasses and see if there's people above us. So we're not going to kill this guard? Let's put a burlap sack over him and then punch him in the face! What if I bring the sack over and I seduce him into putting it over his head? Perfect plan! Okay, I'm going to seduce the shit out of this guy. I run in slow motion over to him. Bonsoir. I spit as I say it. (laughter) Oui. That I am. ...Verr. Of course you can. It's wonderful to meet you. You know, where I am from, it is customary to-- (laughter) Oui. So I can kiss you, through the bag. It is a custom of my people. That comes after the bag. Where should we put him? Do we have rope? I take off one of my gloves and I tie up his hands with the long glove. You don't need any training. Where's Bearsley? You are the brains, you tell us what to do. What about the vault? Open it. Use your lock-picking skills. After! No! No, go to the vault first. I mostly understood. Let's go to the vault. Oh that's good. Very useful. All right, I will do that. What if Paddington is Ripley? Nothing? KRYSTINA and I think I know who Paddington is. What if Paddington is Ripley? What if you type in Paddington? What if you type in Ripley? I pull out my gun! Should we charge in screaming? No, you should stick with that. Here we go. Let's go. Walk in slow motion. Tova, say the line. How could you do this? We compliment you all the time! If you ask me, that's pretty shitty. Type in asshole and see what comes up. Oh no! Shoot at him! Oh no! Is this going to be like marbles-- (yelling) So we got to pull a red one. But be careful we can't-- oh good! Oh, that's good. If more than three marbles fall-- Wait. We have to pull 12 wires. Okay. Red. That's good. The red ones are the best ones to pull. Red! No, red is good. Red again, holy shit! Oh god. We're losing all of the base ones. Green. That was a bad spin. Green! Okay, that's good. Four more! Yellow. Green! That one? Yes, that one. Should I try to climb up there? All right, I'll give it a go. A three! That is a success. Come on now, all of you beauties. Can we still see Bearsley in the sky? I go to shoot my last bullet at him! I failed! Maybe you can make out before you-- We killed Crispin Glover because of you! You pulled his eyeball out of his face! I say we take him back and let Paddington deal with him. Yay, Paddington! You're not secretly Ripley, are you? Congratulations, Tova. You're a vest kind of bear. Bear-coming. That was so confusing. Until we saw what it was. Less likely to make balls fall, right? We were pretty chill about our attacking people.
