But it's not on us yet. Oh look, now you can see us. She does! I thought that, too. If you want to ride a bear there, I wouldn't judge you. Saturday is for sure. No, I was just so excited about New York Comic Con, I wanted to be a part of that announcement. Should we say that we have Kit here? Kit and Wendy. It's about 30 seconds. Yeah. (muffled yelling) I have so many dice. Take this giant bag and just fish some out. No, let him find them. Most definitely, dear. Yes. We are definitely going to pay you. Does anybody remember how much we are supposed to pay them? And how many of those guys do we have? Tell you what, I will front this from my personal funds for this month. Just because we don't have enough in the party funds to cover that. We do not! I am, but you bitches keep spending money! Halfsies? Lovely. Twinsies will pay halfsies. Here you go! 300 for each. Yes, don't worry, you will always be paid from Vox Machina. Not yet. Not just yet. Can I go find Percy? Quite the worker. Yes. Darling... I let Trinket forage around the courtyard, so he's not down here at the moment. Don't touch anything. How did you get away when they-- with the rest of your family? If you know that they murdered your family, how are they still part of society? Will they recognize you? Should we interrogate them first? Find out more about your family? Are they all members of the same party? They travel with the Briarwoods? You might have six. We don't know what happened to them. Well, I think we need to do some spying. That's the thing. I don't know if they do. Oh, we are so involved. We've got your back, darling. Something I do need to know. Percy. If we see them, and we're not ready to show our faces, will you be able to contain yourself? Scanlan has it. Less purple? My passive perception is 21. I give him the evil eye. You're not there. Oh yes, he can. He's actually the guy we go to. We can do things. How long of a ride is it to Kraghammer? Solo style, if you're fast, and back? But you don't have to stick to the road as an eagle. What do you think? Is it stupid to go and ride hard and try to get there and back before--? We don't all have to go. A couple of us can make a fast ride. Or should we wait? I really want the money. No, because some people need to do some work. We need to send some people off. Hopefully be back in time. Our illustrious god just told us it's better to stick to the road because there's bad things-- Yeah, that would slow it down a lot. But that's still a two days' flight-- Oh, okay. She might have some. We'll leave you alone, Percy. To work. Do you not have an earpiece? We can bring-- oh, we're not there. I don't know. I guess so. Actually, I'm staying at the Keep. Good going, Keyleth! I like it! Mm-hm. I'm not there. I walk into the room to see Tiberius throwing things out of the Bag of Holding, I'm assuming. But there were artifacts that they wanted. I remember. Oh, I don't have that. (gasps) Oh no! What if we gave it to Kima? But Kima took some armor we found! (gasps) Oh! No, I remember we found it and nobody equipped it. Can I go with you? And I take off after him! As we're flying, can I keep an eye out for our party members that are returning? That means we're close enough. Brother! We're heading to the portal, Tiberius is working on something. We can get there faster! I'll be back soon. Brilliant! Why are we plummeting? Oh, okay! Tiberius, I'm falling! Vasselheim? You are so educated. Perhaps we could talk later about all of this wonderful history. Who are you talking to? Oh, all of us? Yes. No, we should go. It's the three of us, me and you and-- Persuasion-wise. We go through. Oh my god. Wait, you're saying that we cannot go through? Then let's just fucking go home. Yeah, Karin! This is Karin. Adorable. Good job, Percy, now he's never going to bathe. You! Take care of my bear, I'm leaving him here with you. Oh, Trinket! I love you so. Behave, all right? That's really bad for him! Don't! Wait. Do they know we're coming? We're just in the middle of their home now? Can I perception and make sure there's no traps around us? Just to make sure. We're just popping in, and this is a magic house, am I right? So I can't check for traps worth shit. Great. Good. Great. No. I should probably go find that guy. Or we can go all together. Incredibly difficult, he means to say. People speak very, very highly of your abilities. Can I assist him? Well, we've heard very wonderful things about your abilities and not many people can do such a feat. Did it look anything like this one? Oh my god! I throw my hands up. I just can't. I just can't! How did we not? Oh my god. 50? A year! Why?! Thank you so much. No, I know it's a really beautiful carpet, and it would cost a lot of money to fix up, I understand. Oh, that's the Kraghammer-- We go to see-- Johnny Kraghammer. It was Greyspine. No. We did not die. We, in fact, succeeded in taking care of those creatures. Under-- dark-- carpet. Oh! Excuse me. We came to collect the money you owed us for completing the mission you sent us on. Oh, it was 30,000 gold, plus all the extras for the scalps that we acquired. Oh it was? That is so weird, I remember 30. Mind flayers! A beholder! Have you heard of a beholder? We fought a fucking beholder. That's really good. I start thinking about the carpet and I really do start crying. (sobbing) And my bear! It was really big. Illithid. We destroyed half of an elder brain-- Part of an elder brain. Dwarves! There were dark dwarves. Duergar. He almost died! Just from this one little brain. Are we all rolling? Because we're all talking. I was? I thought Scanlan was. That would be 11. 18,000 gold in addition to the-- Money! (singing) 25,000 gold in my hands right now. Thank you so much. This won't make up for the lost lives we have suffered, but-- (choking up) It helps. Vox Machina! (laughter) Also! Gilmore's Glorious Goods! Great work. Don't give him chocolate! Trinket! You look so cute. We need to get these off of you immediately. But you look really, really cute. And I scratch his little ears. How dare-- Oh look, now I can remember this moment forever. Thank you. Trinket, let's go get you a bath. I go and put it in the party funds. We got our gold. Are we splitting up all the party gold now? Oh, thank you. Do you want me to just split up all the party gold right now? Everybody gets 1,500. Is everybody happy? Trinket, are you just so thrilled? Oh, sweetie. Bath time. I'll do the math. We need to ask around town about the Briarwoods. Shit. We can't do any spying. Maybe. Maybe you guys should go, because I want to spend the next few days training Trinket how to roly-poly roll forward and bludgeon people with his armor. We should maybe send word to him that the Briarwoods should be watched. Should we prepare? Let's do it! I've been training Trinket, though, does that help? Yes! Do not shave his fucking beard off. Why are you so evil? I like it. As we're standing watching that, Trinket comes rolling into the courtyard! Oh, why didn't I get more points in that? Natural 20! Should we call it the roly-poly or the cannonball? I think I like cannonball because it's better to shout during the battle. Oh, we have some formal dresses already. Tiberius. Could you Prestidigitate this thing and make it look like an actual thing? You're fine. That's what it was. You're immune. You're definitely immune to water now. Good job. His toga? He's wearing a toga made out of a tapestry. I go in and put my arm through Percy's arm to make it seem like we're twins. I go in with Percy to make it look like we're the twinsies. Of course. Oh, yes. Percy wasn't feeling very well. He ended up staying home. 11. I pat Vax's hand-- Percy's hand. What the fuck. This is creepy. Vaxy. Yes. He's stealthing. It was the Briarwoods. Do you have any of your people learning about the Briarwoods? Are they magic users in any way? Have you heard anything? Do any of you know, as somebody practiced in the arcane arts, are you good at seeing through illusions? Or-- Anybody that is, you know, very skilled? So she wouldn't automatically know. They wouldn't be able to spot immediately that Percy is not actually-- Great. So wonderful to see you. I give her a hug. We catch any of their eye at all? Can I keep an eye on them as they're walking to their room? Just as long as I can see their mouths moving, I can read their lips. Do I have to perceive it? I have a feat that I can read it. Yeah, I have Observant Read Lips meaning I can read lips from any language I can understand. Yeah. I want to check out this, too. 23. I can sense you, you dick. Can we get a feel for where the Briarwoods are going to sit? Are there place cards? (laughs) Okay. Can I position myself when I sit to where I can see them? So I can read their mouths, specifically. That's probably where Uriel is going to sit. They've got a booster chair for you, Scanlan. Yes, ill. Could I inquire to Lady Briarwood? Vex'ahlia. You as well. I notice your dress is quite lovely. It doesn't look like a fashion that I'm used to seeing. Where do you hail from originally? Really, I'm not familiar. I would love to visit. How long have you been at Whitestone? Can we insight check as, what they're saying? I mean, I know they're lying out their asses. Fuck. 18. We are handier than we look. So dreadful. I know how hard it is to lose someone very close to you. I'm sorry for your loss. Are they whispering to themselves, still? How long do you plan on staying here, Lord and Lady? Do you have plans on the morrow? I would love to give you a tour of the city. Wonderful! Should I send word? How should we arrange this? We are outside of town at our own keep, actually. The Greyskull Keep. Lovely. That will be so fun. Perhaps you can show me some more of your fashions. I love your dress so much. Sounds wonderful. Vax? You looked at Vax? He was telling you to meet him in the foyer, a long time ago. (whispered) You should go spy on their room. Go check out that room. I'll distract them. Could I Hunter's Mark him before they go in their bedroom? I mean they're walking away, when their back is turned, could I do it when they're not paying attention? 20! (cheers) Lord-- no-- Delilah. I don't know what else to do, you guys. They're so evil! They're totally vampires. Oh hey, what's going on?
