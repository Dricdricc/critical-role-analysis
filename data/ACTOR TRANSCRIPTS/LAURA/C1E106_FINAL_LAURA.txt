Have we recovered? Yes, there is, and I just realized I had it on and I hadn't announced it yet. So we got these back in the store! But they're red now. We've got them on this chain and on this chain rope-thing. Cord. And we've got them a keychain. And now, I don't know if you saw them before, but they took a long time to get, and now we just have them in the store. I don't know. It depends on how many people buy them, I guess, but we're going to try to keep them in stock. That's the statement that like, okay, that happened, but this is what I'm really excited about. (sings victory song) Is the camera on? I can't tell. It's a pencil pack. I asked them to make this, because this is so great. So we all have our own pencils. Everybody has a pencil. We've got the "How do you want to do this?" pencil. We've got the "I would like to rage" pencil. We've got a Scanlan pencil-- oh no, this is a Tary pencil. This is a "Doty, take this down" pencil. I don't want to say all the things because they're so great, but check them out. It's in the store now. Does everybody want their pencil? It's a #2 pencil! Do you want the Trinket pencil, Darin? Such a good one. Oh, this is the Pike one. And here's yours, Matt. It's pretty dope, so check them out. I'm in love. I hadn't even thought about that. You're welcome. I'm excited. And there may or may not be-- I don't know if I should announce this. We may or may not have special merchandise that you can only get at the live show. Nope, it's just a live show thing. August 18th! How was that? Damn it. They might just see your forehead. There it is! I know, this is great. Good job, you guys. What is it? Does it have air holes? That's the guys that did The Order. We're computers. That's right. We'll help you out. Which is cool. It's VR. It's really badass, so check it out. Aw, my little Trinket dice bag isn't here. I think it's still in the thing. Sorry. I'll go and get it during the credits. Did we see her? Okay. Is she old or young? I can't remember. Are we allowed? I'll walk forward. You don't know already? Oh shit. Do you know if he's been successful? We didn't even realize that was an option. We intend to face him down ourselves. Pelor mentioned something about the Prime Trammels? It's okay, Grog. It's true, Scanlan. You are. (laughing) And a cube. Incantation of Isolation. What is with this pencil? It was dipped in ketchup or something. But it needs to be sharpened. Do you remember the name of it? I'm going to try casting Locate Object and cast it on the tome that contains the Incantation of Isolation. Try it. Why not. I don't know. Oh. Really? Okay. I'm going to kneel down and pray to the Dawnfather, since he was one of the ones that helped fight the Chained Oblivion, to see if he could guide us at all. Or about the Calamity or something. I'm going to hop on my broom to see if I get a ping on my Locate Object. Wow, you know that? Do any of the tomes have titles on them, though? I feel like Celestial would be what the Dawnfather would speak, though. I don't speak Celestial, so it doesn't really matter. 21. Does it seem like some are older than others? Okay. Was it Pelor? Does Pelor have a book? I don't know why the Incantation of Isolation would be-- Can I look at the bookbinding, though? Do some books seem like they fall apart more? That's cool. Go up and in. Here, get on the broom, Scanlan. We'll fly up. Let's go try to talk to one. It's always good to lie. Pull out Mythcarver and sing. Just sing like it's a microphone. Now ask. Now sing and question. Oh Jesus. I mean, Ioun. We have an earring. We're following the little surge of spectrals. (singing) He's the Chained Oblivion. His name is the Chained Oblivion. Keep telling the story. 22. (whispers) I had a feeling it would be a locked bookcase. (singing) Can they open it up? Vax, can you hear me? I can try to pick it. I can try. My proficiency bonus. Yeah, I got a one on your inspiration. Thanks for that. But I rolled well so it doesn't matter. Hopefully. 19 plus my dexterity modifier plus my proficiency bonus? 30. No, plus inspiration was 31! Oh, jeebies. Oh, in god realm it will be harder. That's the hardest lock I've ever picked, I swear! Are any of the spectrals looking at one, specifically? Can you do your Ioun Stone? Does it glow for anything in particular? Can I read any of them? Elvish, Common, Undercommon, Abyssal, and Draconic. Well, I could potentially grab all of them and shove them in the Bag of Colding. It seems pretty shitty, dumping them out in a pile, but I don't know what else to do. I start grabbing other ones and putting them in the bag. What can you do? Do you have a spell that lets you see things? Reveals things? Yeah! Sing to it or something! You just keep singing, I'll keep taking books. We've got not enough time. 25 books. My Locate Object never pinged? My Incantation of Isolation Locate Object? Oh shit, I just grabbed a bunch of books, but that's the one! It's got to be! Keep looking at it while we're flying, see if you can figure it out! Hold onto me, though, because we're going fast. Place Mythcarver on it! Place Mythcarver in it! That was almost so bad. 28. Oh god, can I hold onto his wrist to help out? Yeah, what if you write in it and say, "Hey, I need the Incantation of Isolation!" Did you cast Friends on it? Did it work? Jesus. Oh god. Okay. 27. Don't you have Suggestion? What language is it?! Are you sure something's there? It's a small book. It's the whole thing! She's going to reappear, obviously. She knows we're here. Yeah, we're at the bowl. Looking for change in the couch? You're such a pain in the neck, Ma! Ugh, you have a third eye! We can learn what its vulnerabilities are. On a success? What does it say the DC is? We literally stick the trammels onto Vecna? I have one! No, I have a stone. Yeah, I'm going to. Can I pull out the little pearl of power? How do we make a trammel? We have a stone, and we want more, I assume. In the Ozmit Sea. Scaldseat? Awesome! Oh my god, you were a boot maker, and now you're a weapon maker! Did it have a name? You don't think? Do you have a seed of power? (tongue click) I kiss him on the forehead. Oh! I have your books. I think they were really secret ones, so I would hate to take those out of here. Take care, darling. I go up to Percy. Are you all right, dear? Where are we going? They're pretty cool. From the cabin to Vasselheim? Pike, you seem very quiet. He's got a good beard. I haven't seen it! Can I look, too, because we'd been fighting when we left, so I'm going to make sure-- Careful of traps. They're still in place. Bear trap. While he was doing that, I want to stealth away with my brother for a moment and say, I'm sorry. About everything. Far enough that nobody can hear us. Jesus Christ. Ten. God damn it. Thank you. Thank you, Matt. I deserved that. That's karma. Oh, okay. I'm going to not move, though, because I don't want to step on another one of those fucking things. Yes. Thank you. I didn't. Yeah, I think so, too. I didn't plan it. If I had, I would have told you. And then when I saw you, it seemed like bad timing to say anything, and then things kept happening. (sighs) I know. It was very spur-of-the-moment. Nobody was standing at our side, except for each other. I don't want you to go. I love you. We could. I could die before you. If she ever talks to me again, I swear I will. Good call. Thank you. Thank you. It's a seed of power, Grog. I've got it, Grog. I've got it. Stop manhandling Scanlan! Because he doesn't like it. We probably need to hurry. Maybe Vasselheim? Why didn't we ask Ioun about that? Is that the imp? Is he see-through? I try to shoot an arrow at him. No, that's not cocked. Cocked! 29. I fucking knew it. Thank you. Insight, maybe? Who was it? Natural 20. Thanks for double-checking. It is. Like I would lie about a natural fucking 20. He's the god of secrets! What do you expect? When I say, hey, name your quote on the text thread, then you send in a quote, that means it's probably pretty solid. I don't think you have that power. I only serve gods with big dicks. I wonder if he can see us in your dimension? Go to Raven Queen's temple right now? Maybe we can do the mansion outside of her temple? We'll be in her temple. We'll be fighting undead, more than likely. Keep running. They've got bigger things happening right now, just keep running. No, what? (laughter) Keep running toward the Raven Queen temple as that's happening. Quickly. Quickly walk past. Understood. I hold Trinket back so that he doesn't go after him. But I do think he's dead. Run where? Redbox, maybe. I think here. I feel like we're safe here. Do you want to head over to Kord's temple as well? I have a feeling if we find him, we'll have to go to another plane. Yeah. I'll go. I'll go with him. Yeah. Yeah. That would be smart. I feel like the mansion is the smartest thing because it's not-- We don't know; Vecna could still see in here. As we're walking, I want to whisper to Scanlan. I'm going to whisper to the Meat Man's crotch because that's about even, right? Then I'll whisper to his waistline. The sword that Ioun was talking about, right, the Sword of Kas? Do you think it could possibly the sword that Grog had? Do you know for sure? Well, no, but she didn't say it wasn't a talking sword. She said it was a vengeful sword. We really should have. Maybe we could ask the sword. And we didn't. But maybe if we see that sword, we can be like, "Hey, do you know who Kas is?" and if he does, then we're like, "Oh fuck!" I'm saying this quietly. I don't want Grog to realize we're doing this. He has a thing for Craven Edge. You did? Oh fuck. Oh shit. Continue. You didn't pass the test. Anything? Delilah Briarwood, Lord Briarwood had the sword, they were seeking Vecna. It could work out. Vecna doesn't have the sword right now-- Exactly! Craven Edge could be the Sword of Kas. By the Briarwoods. They were going to awaken him, but then he died. Or it's just a sword that just likes blood. Sorry, Grog. Yes, of course. We're walking. We're doing this while we walk. We're not wasting time with this conversation. We're traveling with this conversation. Okay. We sent it to the plane of the Dread Emperor. We don't know where he is exactly-- (stammering) We've been speaking to the gods. I'm going to stand next to Grog while I say this. Yeah! I'm going to fly down to the sandpit and land next to Grog. Hi. Champion of Pelor, the Dawnfather. We've been speaking to the gods. We're taking on Vecna. Hopefully not alone, but we need to speak with Kord. I know that sounds odd, but Grog was hoping-- LAURA and How long of a process is this, that we're talking? I'm not trying to rush faith. I'm just saying that Vecna has ascended to godhood. We have a limited amount of time to take him down. We need to speak with Kord. You can't speak to him directly? Maybe draw his attention to us? The need is dire. He's not? Okay, yeah, this is going to go so well. Hold up. 20? Maybe you can tell him there's a big fight coming. Call out to him! Get his attention. Yeah! Say he can help take down the big bad guy. Definitely! Prime tickets to a UFC fight. East guard? He is god. East guard. Is that near the Fields of Elysium, or a totally different place? Right, yeah. So you have nothing else that you can do? I know that you're going to fight his troops, but the fact of the matter is Vecna is a god. If we can't find some way to speak to Kord, we may not be able to save the world again. Powerful beans. Super. (laughs) He hasn't looked at us this whole fucking time? You have everything you've ever wanted, Grog. Congratulations. Can I see what he was drawing in the sand while we were over there? 18. Groon, if Vecna attacks here, he'll bring undead. He's really creepy, isn't he? Back away. Good job, Grog. Yeah. He's in Ysgard. "He's-god." Lovely. Can I have light blue hair? No, I want beautiful hair. I've always wanted blue hair. Oh shit! It's the temple of Bahamut? Yes! I really hope Vasselheim stands. There could be an actual seed of power within there. I'll look over his shoulder and help look. I'm going to help look. That's not bad. Well... It's a bean with a dick. Percy? With your migraine, do you know what else we need to make these trammels? (gasps) Platinum mines! So? We know where they are. We need more platinum. Well, I didn't write exactly how much platinum we have. I transposed the platinum into gold in my notes. We could go to the bank here in Vasselheim and switch out money for platinum. We have enough gold to do. It's 500 platinum each, you said? 5,000 gold would be 500 platinum? Okay. Well, we need to not lose. They're still diminished if we do defeat Vecna. That part of them is forever chaining him. Right. As far as we know. Do you know who it could be? Of course it matters, dear. At least we'd know if he raised them up like he said he did, if we'll be fighting undead Gilmore and undead Allura. Can we scry through this dimension? Funny you should ask. Allura has it. Allura has it. Sure, and Allura came down and saw it-- no, I gave it to Allura. I'm sorry, Grog. I gave you your deck of cards back! The skull was very dangerous, and at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Look, we just went and got a bunch of beans for you. I don't believe if you'd freed it you would've gotten a wish, I think you would've fought something. No. We need to scry on the fucking friends, we need to check in on that skull, maybe. And you need to maybe open up the plane to the Dread Emperor and see about the Craven Edge. Is it? What if that weapon is super good against Vecna? No, Kas is destroyed. He turned to ash. He fought Vecna and was turned to ash. He fought against Vecna! They destroyed each other. It's the reason Vecna was destroyed to begin with. (whispering) Please please please please please... Just go, just scry! Well, Allura has the skull. Do we have any way to talk to her? Can you scry on the object? No... Oh my god, can you scry on Tary? What if he came searching for us? She might be in the Colding. Let's get into the mansion and talk to her. Let's go in the mansion first. The door's open. We're talking through the door. Oh, that's a good one. Solid question. The Shadow Knight. Does she have to answer? Do they have to answer? Oh shit. She's already been brought back. She's a necromancer. And be sneaky about it, okay? I hate him so much. What's going on? You're outside of the mansion. Come in the mansion. He knows. We'll lead him anywhere, darling. She'll remove it soon enough. Can you Plane Shift us from here, from the mansion? TALIESIN and Is that a 9th-level spell? As awful as it is, we need to sleep, if we can't fight him in the morning or anytime. Things. Yeah, that's smart. Immune to poison. We have two chalices. Bank in the morning. Then off. Fabulous. Shall we rest up? An angel? You've seen it.
