You're in that picture too, Matthew. No you were not. Is that part of announcements? You mother-- wow. So we can hear about it! (gasps) Do you really? Can we know what you took? No, that's got to be a surprise. Oh, you don't have to choose? Fucking rangers. No you didn't. I took the second level in rogue, though. I don't get any rogue spells, but I do get to disengage now. We're still in the house? I'm a little nervous that the trap that went off on the front door was an alarm system. For whoever left. Yeah, but we saw a trail of blood leading to the front door. No, I think it was the blood from-- I think. I mean, I think that it was-- She's been fucking tracking us? Because you already went up to the top. Before I leave the room, can I check to see if it seems like Ripley was alone or if there were other people? Natural 20. All right. Grog? Can I have some of that Dust of Tracelessness? Definitely. Can I sprinkle it around so that they can't track us in the room, having been here? Definitely. Not as bad a felony as shoving spice up your ass, but... Yes, yes, yes. And get ready to leave, because we can't hang around-- Can she hear us? When you scry, can you hear? Yeah, so if we're talking about her right now, she can hear-- You're a piece of shit. You're ugly. He won't shoot it. He'll sit on it. Is there a safety? He won't. Trinket, sit on the bed. If anybody walks in the room that's not one of us, well. Make them very scared and make sure they-- (laughs) Shoot them with the gun. Don't you fall asleep. Don't you fall asleep, Grog. Okay, yeah. The ball, yeah, that I gave you. Just the one ball, though. The ball of seeing. The ball of scrying. We'll talk to... Treev? Percy, we'll find her. I'm going to go sit with you while you scry. Trinket. So we're not in the room with Trinket. Trinket, you keep doing your thing. All right, let's go back to the other room and let's get something else to-- Do you want one? I have a bag. Does that dice go to dice jail? She's fucking finding another one. I thought the gun was under the bed with Trinket. Whisper's in the ocean. The dagger. Fuck. Can we instantly be in the middle of the ocean with her? Is she? Mist into the ocean? Of course. Yes, Grog? That's a very scary place. Especially, imagine if one of us was wearing all of the Vestiges. She's not going to give it up. Could she be the one letting the dragons know about-- could she be the spy? Fuck, why didn't we kill her when we had her in our-- Are we by the ocean at all? Can Misty Step travel faster than a boat? So if it took her a week to get where she is now, we could probably get there-- We don't necessarily drown immediately. We could bomb her! Will we be able to find her in the middle of the ocean? No, you can scry up, yeah. Maybe somebody in an airship. We'll keep scrying until we see if she's found it. Into the Plane of Abyss? He wants whitestone. He's going to know. Do you have green gems? No, but the green gems from Whitestone? No, but here's the thing, maybe somebody did see her. Not five days?! But we don't have to fly, we just have to teleport there. But we don't have a plan. We have five days to figure out how to fucking kill a dragon. Oh Jesus. Potentially. Treev? Is Treev downstairs? Treev? We need to talk to you. It's rather urgent. We found her body. In her home. About a week ago. I think. We had nothing to do with it. We could've left town. Your mistress has-- had a very powerful item on her. It's why we sought her out as well. From what I could see, her attackers were not alone. There were five of them. Oh shit. Treev-- I put Dust of Tracelessness on the ground. In her home. Plus, you know what? Exactly. Your man has seen a dead body before. He's going to be able to tell that it's been there for a while. (laughs) That we would come to hire her after we had already-- Specifically an airship of sorts-- Thank you. Oh really? It's a much easier enchantment. 750, or if you have a need of gems, we have gems. So many things. You should call your enchanter. An hour. Kynan? Payment? But we don't even know what he's doing yet. Of course, I don't know what we're going to have him do, that's all. How about these two beautiful sapphires? They're quite lovely. And-- and I pull out a giant raw ruby as well. 200 each for the sapphires, and the ruby is 150. It's only a hundred gold short! That is the most valuable necklace! (yells) Scanlan! You should try the dice game just once. Yeah. Isn't this the seven or the twelve game? I know, I feel like the minimums should go down in the middle of the day. Double down! Yeah! Okay, all right, I'm here. Mm-hmm. Well, we're going to be above her. Maybe we can be the one to drop something heavy. Regardless of what he makes, who wields it? Fenthras is a horrible weapon wielded by a horrible being before I had it. A gun can do the same thing. Well I'm interested in seeing it. Is this thing you're building going to kill a lot of people in addition to the dragon? Percy, if you had stayed with her and let the Briarwoods go, a god, a terrible god, would probably be loosed on the land right now. I think you chose correctly. Oh, Keyleth! Really? Hold off of the alcohol. We have a lot to do today. Please, get her some fresh air. Percy. You're a better man than you believe. No, it doesn't. Shit. Wait, what?! What the fuck did you do? Did you really? Did you steal it? Tell me you didn't do anything-- That's great! Right now? Oh the enchantment! Right. We're waiting on that, that's why we're fucking here. Shall we bring the weapon down there? Yay, then Trinket's with us again. So he looks totally trustworthy. Scanlan. He seems like the type, you might want to try selling him some of that fusaka. Can I insight check him? 19. We need to remove the enchantment from it. If we can remove the enchantment, if it takes a long time to transfer, maybe you can keep transferring it after we've left? Is that a thing? Great. What?! Really? That fast? You are very powerful, you. You wouldn't be able to identify something for me, would you? You seem so smart, is all. Darling, we're already here, please? Oh, damn it. I will pay you. How much do you want? Just to identify something, that's all dear. 100 gold. Darling. It seemed effortless for you to do that before. Is it hard? Fine, fine. Shit! Fine. A hundred gold, whatever. I just want to know, can you look at this please? It's a tea set, it's gold. Isn't it beautiful? It's so good we didn't drink from it. Lovely. Thank you so much. Of course dear. That guy was weird. And potions of healing. Saaba and what? They'll give a good deal? Potions. I need healing potions. Who needs healing potions? Okay. Scanlan, can you come with me? Can we find a Hand of Ord? I want to talk to him. We're not making a street deal right now. We met with J'mon Sa Ord earlier. We have their blessing. 18. Yeah. We're in need of some healing potions. I'm assuming, as a guard of the city, you have access to quite a few? Some greater healing potions would be wonderful. Of course. Six regular? Thank you so much. Your aid is appreciated. Be pleased. Vox Machina. And then I want to buy like three more greaters. Can I say I haggled? Shut up! Natural 20! All right, three more greater healing potions. Sounds good. Can I insight check him? 27. Yeah. Darling? We all have off days. We're about to leave. We can. I won't tell anyone. I give him 50. That's for lying to me. All right. Minus 1100. Yes, Let's go get on the boat. I turn around and wink at him as I go up. Also thank you Backblaze! Wait, before we do that! We forgot to mention at the top of the show. There's only one week of preorder left on the bracelets and the pins. He's wearing the bracelet. I know, you did. I heard you, but, you know. In case people were drowning you out. And then we also have the limited items, which we only have a little bit left in the store the nail wraps, and the patches that were limited edition at Comic-Con that are still there. I think, still in the store? So yeah. The rings! And the rings, the spinning rings. Okay, sorry. Don't throw up again. 22. The one that I harpooned! Wow. Well, we vouched for her at the time. We're super powerful. No, we'll stick with the Shrew. Was that hard for you, Grog? Do you think this is where they knocked Thordak down? Didn't they fight Thordak in the ocean? I'll do that! I'll sleep out, and Trinket will want to do that as well. Stars, Trinket. Beautiful. We'll have two scrys tomorrow if you learn the spell. But it's in the ocean, isn't it? And we're very high above it? I want to hold Fenthras in my hand and keep thinking about the things Saundor said. Can you scry again immediately? That's how long the spell lasts. How many people can you cast it on? That's sick. Don't be a green dragon! You know, I thought it was a possibility, but this is the first time I'm sure your girlfriend is way cooler than you. I do some sunbathing. They're going to be coming out any minute. Unless they're already out. Could we shoot the boat from above and destroy their escape? Yes. Right. So we wait until she drowns, and then we take it from her. I wonder if she hired the boat, or if it's hers. I would hate to kill innocent crew members. Can you cast Water Breathing on us before you fly down, and that way-- or is that going to fuck up your spells? 24 hours. So just in case we end up in the water, we're not fucked. I can be death from above on the broom. Yes, yes, we need to double check that this is actually the boat. Can you cast a spell, just in case shit happens, as soon as we get close enough to the ship? No, the spell, the breathing spell. Me. She told me all about it. 25. It looks like the boat's been docked there for a while. A camp on the shoreline? Is it close by the boat? Can you scry and see if she's still underwater, or if she's camping? Because I see smoke. Well I guess you don't need to now. There's people on the boat waiting still. But you should probably cast breathing. But cast breathing on us first. Yes, I do. Once we get close enough. Are they seeing us? Do they look like they're looking over the sides of the boat? 20. No, they don't look like they're looking over the side of the boat? Yeah, it's a flare. Okay, okay. Shit. I can fly there on my broom, but I don't fly very quickly. A pterodactyl. Three more minutes of scrying, still? Maybe the scrying was ill-timed. Oh jeez. I ready the broom. I get on the broom and wait. Well you can hop on his back. Anybody that comes on board, lock them up. Immediately. I tell Trinket to hop in the necklace because we're going to be traveling very quickly, dear. She's still scrying. We can, they might be by the ship. I shoot the arrow and try to get to the boat. The oracle arrow. Oh, come on! Was it underwater? Can you at least tell that much? Fuck. Good times. Who are you shooting? Oh, I thought he already ran under. While this is happening, can I have taken a flying run off of the airship and started flying toward the smoke? The campfire? Yeah. Percy! Make sure the airship stays far away from these boats. I don't want Ripley having any access to the airship. Can I get a closer look at the campsite? Is there anybody that I can see around it from above? Yes, 30, then. No, I wanted to fly down a little closer and see if I can see any footprints, and see where they lead. I hope so, because I love those commercials.
