Technology? What's it all about? That's true. (coughs) However -- Right! That would be us. Sorry about that. Hey boo. Yeah. Too scared to talk is all. Is Lady Kima with us? Wait, what? Hmm.. We shouldn't tell her about the rug. (laughs) (scattered coughing) I take that. "to the lot of you, and my greatest thanks." (all laugh) Good thing I'm strong then, huh?
