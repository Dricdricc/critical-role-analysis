What? No. Oh, my dice! Where are my dice?! I'm so nervous, I don't even have my dice! Oh my god, are they in there? What? Who goes up what next? Oh, I think it's me! I'm a really good giver of advice. I learned that about myself. No, I really feel like I'm going to throw up. (retching noise) I threw up so many dice! You should check out his Twitter page because he has printed out Flat Mercer and he's chronicling his adventures, and I'm pretty proud of it. There's some Guinness in the fridge. E3's next week! Oh wait, no it's not. It's two weeks from now. It's two weeks from now. I'm sorry. I've always thought that about you, Taliesin. No you're not! Just straight into it! Oh jeez. He's trying to puke you up? It's in his butt. It's a strength saving thing, so-- Back when we first made these characters, I remember you saying that. Really? You're in its butt. How can it see you? What if we could've chased after them? Right away? I would have chased after them, immediately, when it took off. That's really fast, though. What do great eagles have? Giant eagles, I think, have really fast speed too. So, if the eagles were to pick up somebody-- Wait, you have acid resis-- no, you don't, because Keyleth-- it went away. Yeah, remember? Because she used-- Gross! Well no, I wanted the eagles to pick up Pike and Percy. I literally am sending the eagles as this is happening and I dash out of the tree on my broom, and go for the Immovable Rod, just long enough to stop and grab it and keep taking off after the dragon. It's broken? No, it was a bite or a claw. That's my favorite kind of oatmeal. Oh but we have Heroes' Feast, is that good? Oh, that's way better! You can breathe! Are you raging? What about giant eagles with people on them? Don't let the bird get hit by Umbrasyl! Do not let the bird get hit! You will plummet to your fucking death. I'm so far away! I just want to know what he's saying. Is he Hunter's Marked still-- I haven't taken any damage. How fast can my broom go? And my boots of haste don't do shit to a broom. You're really smart. You would think to do that. Oh my god! And you're itty bitty still! I guess we head down that direction. Can I see what it is? (laughs) Vax pours a drink. Halt! Who are you? What's your business here? You were a runt, Grog? Was he rather small? Made of goats? Shale, what were you doing out here with a scouting party? It seems-- Did you succeed? Wait, you think you can kill a dragon? What's the matter? Can you not see anything down there? I pop Trinket out and put Vax on top of him. Don't you feel so tall now? Maybe how to get into the lair without it knowing? That's wonderful. How far were the dead ones? Plus, Zanror is still alive, as is his wife. I think. Well, we can obviously fly. Would we know that? Healing stuff? That takes too long to think about. Is your arm back? Are we going to Scry it or are we just going to go? How long would it take if we just flew up? 20 minutes? Can I-- well, I can't sense anything about it with Hunter's Mark, I just know where he is. And he's up in his lair. Moving around, or is he chilling? Unless we fly. I could also use another spell and summon a couple more eagles. I could summon two more eagles. And that could get how many of us up? But two more eagles would get all of us up? It is? So they're about to go away. What if we use the eagles, send them up. Once they're used up, they're gone at the top, and then I'll just summon two more and send everybody else up? Once the people make it up the top, that way it takes less time. A couple people hop on the eagles right now, because we only have a little bit of time left. Everybody hop on an eagle. Two of the halflings-- two of the gnomes can get on. All right. You guys go. That is level-- Oh, good. Level three. So I've got two level threes left. With my Pearl of power. I have Conjure Animals, not Woodland Beings. They're too big for you, teeny. And because I Conjured Woodland Animals, I lost my Hunter's Mark. I want to sleep for a day. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. Is that your music? Do you want-- say that again? See if it's something that would be worth-- Yeah. Can I use my ranger skills to try to camouflage us into the side of the mountain? To make us even more non-seeable? Add ten. 32. Thank you. Thank you for pointing that out. I appreciate it. How? Yeah. Did you scry yet? Okay. I do the same thing. I soot my face up, too. Let's all make battle paint while she's scrying. I get soot on my finger and walk up to Percy and just put a line from his forehead down his face. It was pretty small. Can you scry that little cavern to see where it leads to? Can you scry your mind up the cavern? Did you see Umbrasyl? Could he still be invisible? Yeah. Go in the little hole, then. It's roomy. Well then, maybe she doesn't lead the way. (laughter) I'll take the horn. Scanlan, you should take the horn. I'm saying when she dies. If she dies. Could I insight check her? I feel like she's lying through her teeth. (laughter) Natural 20. Oh. I really want all those things-- Does anybody want to ride the broom with me? Yeah. Wait! Aren't you wearing the strength gauntlets? Can you dispel that shit? Well then, let's avoid them. Let's just go around them. Could you just do that the entire way into the cavern? I'm on a broom, do you want to ride it with me? Just kidding-- Percy's already on. Oh, that's acid! Yeah. (cutesy voice) It's too small... Are you kidding me right now? All right. I will give you a minute head start to get across the room. After that, I'm coming in. So you better hope you're at the dragon by that point. How long has it been? I still want to be stealthed on the broom but I take off into the cavern. Yes. 22. Are you on the broom with me still? Nice, Pike! Yes. I'm going to fly on my broom as far in as I can. And land, maybe on that? And just shoot arrows towards where I heard it coming from. I feel like I have one blazing bowstring left, because I used it once in the last battle, right? Okay. Then I'm going to try it through the blazing bowstring. Piece of shit! 19. That was just for the first attack. I rolled twice for disadvantage. So that's the blazing bowstring. 22. On my first attack! If I release Trinket, is that an attack? Or is that a bonus action? Raven's Slumber. You can make a melee attack. No, that's not it. Bonus action to release it! I'm going to use a bonus action, and I'm going to shout at Trinket to go run towards my brother. I'm going to attack it again. Yeah. Oh, disadvantage. 27. 12. Is that sneak attack because my brother is next to it? So I would have gotten the sneak attack on both those? Or just on the one? Additional five. 17. I want to duck down if I can, behind that whatever that I'm standing on now. Okay. I just want to duck behind it so I'm away from anything flying at me. 18. She can't hear you, she's deaf. Do we get advantage on any of it? Me. And I think you cast it on Scanlan. Aren't you glad I gave you the armor? Look at all the gold, hiding over there! Why is that bad? He doesn't save it like that? I'm going to roll the brown dice for Trinket. Dexterity? 12. He's resistant to bludgeoning! Yes! Thank you. Nope. 20. Do I have any kind of sense of-- Ugh, your Stinking Cloud is right there. Are at disadvantage again, right? If Trinket gets up, does that use any of my stuff? Trinket can move freely-- So Trinket is going to get up. And he's going to bite Umbrasyl's tail to try to distract him, so I can run between his legs. Oh, he's got a keen sense of smell, so he's got advantage on smell perception. Well, I rolled a 15. And I don't know what I add to it. --oh, perception, seven. So 22 He's going to attack him. Yeah, I'm going to have Trinket do one of his attacks so I can move and run. That doesn't count? I feel like it still counts, though. It's only 15. What does Stinking Cloud do to me? MARISHA and Fuck. I try to run away. I try to run around and run past Umbrasyl. But I would go through it if I tried to run between its legs. I'll just try to run along to the side. Sure! Why the fuck not?! I'm on the broom. Does it matter? Jesus. I just want to run, on the broom, and use my bonus action. Is that as far as I can get? On my broom, though? And can I use my bonus action to hide? Can I try to hide? I'm going to dash and I'm going to get further away. Yeah! I'm going to hide behind those things. Yeah. I think that hits. Because he's in farts? Cool. Tight, tight. Oh, that it does. I'm glad I hid by another acid pool. Yay. A strength or a dex saving throw? 13. Vex. It's like adding insult to injury. You're going to die and I'm going to call you your brother the entire time. Now we can watch it kill us. Yeah, he does! I don't know which one to roll here. They've all been betraying me. 17. He's trying, man. He's out. He's so brave. I am in the acid. That's great. Should we write these numbers down? Monstah! What is that? Hey! Kill that fucking dragon. Natural 20? Why doesn't Percy just always attack melee? Oh my god, he's still alive? Hi. Okay. I'm going to-- Oh, jeez. Who all is within five feet of it? Is everybody within five feet of it? Then I'm just going to attack it twice. 19 plus 12 hits. Can I Hunter's Mark him? Yeah. 19 on the first hit. Then the second one hits as well, 17 plus 12. 23. So we on the outside, we can't use Faerie Fire? It's just a bubble of dark? Or do we see Umbrasyl peeking out? Oh, it's that whole table! He already did it. Yeah! Cut his horns off! Cut his wings off! Jump off those head things! He's looking rough. Reckless? Plus necrotic. Plus necrotic. I'm going to attack him a couple times. How about that? No advantage anymore, though, huh? 18 on the first one doesn't hit. That first one was way better, I should've kept it! The second one was 16. No, I still have a bonus action, so I'm going to hide with my bonus action. Really? Did you really just do that? Do I still have Pass Without Trace? 20. Who all? I'm not affected by that, though, because I'm outside of the bubble? Trinket's unconscious. Plus necrotic. It was 60. But he was at 53 when he got hit. I run over to Trinket. I cast Cure Wounds on Trinket. You were so brave in here! That's major. You know, if you seek another dragon to kill, you might meet us in Whitestone. We're forming an army there. It's like kissing a child. Keep it going, Keyleth. Just mug down with him. Can I look for those, too, since dragons? Oh, he probably doesn't need my help. I get advantage on all dragon things. It doesn't matter. I rolled shit, twice. 12. What about all the stuff in that pile of shit? I like the sound of that. Yeah, we're totally going to go back. We're going to return a lot of this gold to Whiterun. Westruun. All the towns. I agree. All the other gold that's just sitting around, I mean, we should probably just take to help the battles. Most of it. And bring it back to Westruun. I said we weren't going to! We're going to take it back to Westruun. Three hours. It's only been an hour? No. Because this is going to be worth a lot of fucking money. We should get some of the blood and put it in the Bag of Colding. We don't find any of those glyphs like there were in-- Not the circles, I meant the transportation glyph that we beamed into his-- I can put it in the Bag of Colding, and then it'll keep it. As long as the other dragons don't realize that we've just done this. Would I know if they would know? I don't know if it's actually safe to just hang out in this dragon's lair. That's a wonderful idea. Yeah!
