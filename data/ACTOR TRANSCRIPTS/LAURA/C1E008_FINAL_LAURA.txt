But do they? Your foot is melted off. Oh, that's not bad. It's four out of five. Can they see us? There was a path further down that led further on into the tunnels. I think we should follow that. So we hope he used Dimension Door. Oh, Tiberius. He has no idea what's happening. We still need to hide. And heal. Around the corner or something. Can we stealth further down? Can I use my robe of infinite twine, which I have on my person in another game before. Because it's connected to my rope. Can I use that and tie it around Kima and hook it to Trinket so he can drag Kima along? Okay. We should just run. 17. So that's Trinket. But we all add plus ten? Okay. That's 20 for Trinket and 29 for me. No more spells? Okay, maybe you can make it-- Can I look around and and see if there's anywhere that looks like we could hide, tuck in between rocks or something where we wouldn't be visible? Oh wait, I get an advantage. 20. 20. Cover. Okay. Let's do that. I was searching for another place to hide. Oh! Lovely. I think we should probably-- What?! (sighs) I'm okay. Or maybe I can use my tracking and see if I can catch a scent. Grog does smell. Are all of Tiberius's things stone with him? Good job Pike! Wait, she can't do that again? You can't do it again for Kima. And once we rest, you'll have it again? You probably should keep your voice down, Tiberius. Grog is missing, actually. And the queen took him. We have to find Grog but we have no spells. If we do find him, we can't do anything! We should wake her up. Where do you touch her? (laughs) You were turned to stone, the king got killed, the queen took Grog, we don't know where. Actually, Clarota got you out of that castle alive. (gasps) Oh my gosh. Wait, did I Hunter's Mark the queen? Did I? I can use my Hunter's Mark to track her! It maintains for up to eight hours! Can I use my Hunter's Mark to find out where she is and then we rest and go there? Wait, wait, wait. Let's just find out where she is first. I've got Hunter's Mark! Just stay put, Footless! (all laugh) Yes. Just give us one second. Can I use the freaking Hunter's Mark? I don't know! (whispers) The city, they're close. (louder) So that is right in front of the keep? They are in the city. And pop up, perhaps, where she is? All of us? Or just you? Is it all of us or just you? Well, but then you will be alone, surrounded by duergar and Grog. I'm going to only sleep for a little bit, cause I didn't use all my spells I only need to rest for half the amount of time, maybe. I think we'll be fine. Because she needs to rest as well. We hurt her pretty badly. We've got to sleep, Keyleth. You can do it, Pike. Maybe this yellow vial of potion could do something for it as well. Why do you keep putting your foot up near me? (all laugh) It looks really disgusting by the way. It's so gross. You don't have any feet left. (all laugh) You've got a toe nubbin. A teeny tiny little knife. He will live. (gasps) With the dude with the black horn. I'm concentrating so hard. (all laugh) Maybe we should just calm down and go to sleep. How do you feel now? (all laugh) Tiberius. Shh. That was weird, right? Good night. Trinket, go sleep with Vax. Thank you for telling us, Tiberius. So have we healed completely? (gasps) Where's it moving? Where, which direction? Wait. Where is that in relation to us? We should go that direction. You have no power over me. Well, it went that way. We should go. As stealthily as possible so we don't alert the entire freaking camp. I try to make it look like we weren't around this area as much as possible without our Dust of Tracelessness. So technically, Lady Kima, we might be able to get back in eventually and get your weapon. And there's a vault. We should go look for Grog. Oh, I don't know which one to roll. 24. Oh, I didn't roll for Trinket. Hold on. Trinket, shush. Oh, I didn't feed him today, he's probably so hungry. Fresh-ish? Oh no. The only time I've seen duergar split across like this was when we saw the camp of that creepy centipede creature. Yeah. Do I see any of those kind of tracks around? It's going to be that centipede creature thingy. Stitch monster. I like it. It's a good name. Can I tell if Grog definitely came this way? What do I add that to? I don't understand. Oh. Okay, cool. Natural explorer, primeval awareness. I don't have any idea what I'm looking for. (all laugh) It's a survival check. Okay. Oh, good. So that's 22. Two grooves? I wonder if they have him prisoner now. If he came out of his mind funk. Lovely. Well, Grog definitely came this way. As did the stitch monster, so you don't have much choice but to follow. Be aware. We're all very aware of-- Any movement at all... happening. Is this still the Underdark? I can't sense anything or any creatures nearby? Ugh! Great! Can I use my primeval awareness and see if I can sense Grog within six miles of us? Oh, I can use an action to focus my awareness on a region around me and then I can sense whether-- oh, well, no. It's only certain types of creatures. Well, no. It says "aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead". Really? So what do we do? So we have to go beyond it. Can we keep to the edge and try to not disturb the rock as much as possible. Oh, it's that high? Are there any rocks around us? Any big rocks? Anything loose? Anything I can grab near us? Yeah. Anything to throw as far as I can out and see if it-- Can you send your light source up? Can anybody send light up and see how high the ceiling goes? Okay. Thanks. There's no way to avoid it. Tiberius, how many times can you cast pillars of... whatever? Pillars. How many times can you cast Grand Columns? Could we potentially walk on columns across this thing? Potentially. What about a wall from out from the side? Yeah! What were you going to say? Hop. So, that might not be enough. Trinket, hop on this rock. A lot. Trinket's a boy! I'm not leaving Trinket behind. So everybody get on that and we'll see what happens. Okay, yeah. How about you guys go and I'll stay with Trinket. You guys go. It's like half a mile. Oh, just do it. I don't sense any undead with my primal awareness do I? Oh, and Kima! Pike, pray! do something! Well, Trinket, what do you want to be? A lizard? A mouse? A kitten? (gasps) A kitten. You want to be a kitten? Oh, he's a Persian. You're the cutest, Trinket. I tuck him into my shirt. He's so cute. Let's go! Come on! Let's get on this thing! Grog's getting ahead of us. The rock would be less. It's a very thin piece of stone. Quick! Float us! Do we see anything? I'm keeping an eye out, see if I see any movement or anything that's maybe sparkles. I don't know. What's it sound like? Go! Can we go faster? That's not Grog! We're going to toward a monster! Oh, it's really good we're not standing on it! How much does he weigh? (giggles) I punch him in the face! We wanted to throw him as far as we could. Two, three! (whispering) Go faster. Go faster! Oh my god, we're going to fight? We're going to fight this thing? Oh, god. We're all stuck on a single piece of rock. Ooh, I like it. 21. Yay! Hunter's Mark! Right on that guy. Okay. I'm going to lightning arrow him. Oh, I can't do that because I Hunter's Marked him. I'm going to Hail of Thorns that guy. Okay, at level three. Through my Bow of Blazing Bowstring. 22. Yes. Yes! So then I roll my regular damage plus 3d10? Okay, whoa. So 14 for the first. 4d10, this is crazy. Four, 11, 19. 21. Yes. Oh plus Hunter's Mark damage! Six. Hop off? No way. I'm not stepping on this bone shit. That's my turn. Oh he's tucked into my armor. I get two because it's favored terrain, right? Yes, okay good. 23. Oh man. It's a girl? Why is that demeaning? Can he heal us? That's where we landed. That's something, that's something, Percy! That's better than a one. That's good, that's good! Plus anything? It's on your spell page. Oh, okay. On the ground, you look up like... Oh. Oh. Acid. None of us have gotten hit yet. All right. I don't want to hit Lady Kima with any of my attacks, so I'm just going to have to do... I'm going to do the Blazing Bowstring again. And I'm going to attack it twice. Ooh! That was a 30! 29. And 23. 14 points of damage on the first one. (laughs) What did I do on that? That was weird. 14 on the second one as well. But with Hunter's Mark-- she's still Hunter's Marked! Four. Kima's being held by him. Nice Blind, Scanlan. Kima. All of us except for Percy, I think. It's better than one, Clarota! It's better than one! 13. Plus your spell thing? Should I roll for Pike? 19. Oh, 19 and then for Trinket-- oh no. No! Oh, plus her-- wait, I'm looking up her constitution. Plus one. 17. Seven. But I rolled a 19. (gasps) 28 points?! Oh, shit. Boom! All of a sudden, my bosom comes flying out. No, in the bones? Five hit points. That's good. That's me! Is there anything-- what's nearby? Is anything within five feet of it? Is anything within five feet of it? Trinket's going to be affected. Oh! I command Trinket to move, then. Can he? Can he try to climb up and get away from it? Oh, no. He'll take a hit, won't he. Do it. Oh god, but he's so low on health. He's right next to it! Get up, Trinket, get up on the wall. And I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns on the thing. Five feet. What is it, is it an acrobatics? Athletics. I don't know what to add, but it's 19 plus whatever. Strength? 23. Oh, it hits! Oh no! Trinket's unconscious! Oh, no! He's lying in the skeletons. Do I get to-- can I move if I attack, or is that it? Will somebody save Trinket? Okay, then I still attack him. But wait, will I do damage to Trinket, then, still on the ground, unconscious? Well, I was going to do Hail of Thorns, but I shouldn't because he's within five feet? All right, I do a regular flaming arrow. No, I only used it once. Shitballs. Okay, then I'm-- I have regular arrows. I'm going to use Bloodseeking Bow, then. Oh god. I'm freaking out. 26. Okay. 11, plus Hunter's Mark. 15. And then the Bloodseeking Bow does ten bleeding damage each round. Okay. 24. That's 12. 13. Oh god. Not so much. Can you pick Trinket up and bring him up on the wall? What are you talking about? She's a paladin! Dance! Around his waist! No! Get Trinket out, and I'll pull Pike up. I'm healing! Giving a healing potion. The minimum, because someone else can heal him, right? Seven. He's only got seven little health points! Trinket! Oh! (sobs) Buddy! I'm crying and I'm petting him and I say, "It's okay." I've got it, but I'm busy with Trinket. Do we recognize this elf at all? Don't put them on, though. Don't put them on. Oh, really? Let me see it. Oh, yay! Really? Do I see any tracks around? Do I see tracks? Can I sense goliath tracks? 25. Because of your foot! They're going to try to make him into one of the stitch monsters! We're not there. (whispers) We should go! It was so good! Oh, they did that?! You did that?! That was mean! Yeah, loving shit. Trinket is brown. They completely keep their composure. I want to do it! Just snot running out of my face. I want to do it! I saw it! It's so cute! Is she an astronaut? That's what it looked like. It's an astronaut, Ashley!
