Oh god, what's happening? Oh my god! No. He died because of the shirt! We have to get the shirt off of him! We have to get the shirt off! We have to take it off of him, quick! If you get blood on my fucking clothes-- No! There's actually a few little orchestra seats that are still available. What was that word in there? Classy? Yeah, definitely. Oh, just the same announcements from last week. Which is all the stuff that's available at GenCon is now available in our store. So you can go in there and check out some maps that are amazing. We have the Wildemount maps, now available, by Deven Rue. They're really beautiful. We've got pins and we've got t-shirts and we've got bumper stickers that are praising the Traveler's name. It was a totally smart idea. Best idea ever. What did he write? (gasps) And you did that with blood on your hands! Terrible. What do you guys want to see? What do you want to do when we're here? I don't know a lot, but there's the Lavish Chateau. Yeah! Well, it's a really nice-- it's an inn, you know? And my mom performs there. It's really nice. It's really-- it's the opposite of fire, Caleb. It's really cool. Sure. I should probably keep myself disguised while we're here, though, just in case. Yeah. I pissed off that guy and he said he would kill me. No, he didn't seem like the type that would really do a lot of killing himself, you know? Yes, and there's a lot of people you can talk to here. If you want to get somebody killed, here's the town to do it! Fjord, you don't remember, do you? Yeah, no. I pissed off this guy. He was there to see my mom. The Traveler was teaching me different spells at the time, you know? I had just started learning about them. So I sort of made myself look like my mother. Well, I sort of lured him out onto the balcony. Yeah, he was just stuck out there. That's all. Yeah. Yeah! Yeah. Lord Sharp. No. He was super not sharp. Oh, you were talking about the mind. I don't know. I didn't even know he was a lord. Everybody was a hit job with-- everybody. Nobody made it out clean from that place. Well, all over the Opal Archways is this really pretty-- it's a great marketplace and stuff. Lots of shops. I didn't see too much, from my window you could see all the houses. It looked like a quilt. It was beautiful with the roofs. And you could see the ocean, so I know the wharfs are around there, you know? You want to see my room? Well, we can go to the ocean first. Fjord, but what about all the sea monsters? Giant sea monsters. There's so many. I saw a giant tentacle come out of the water one time. Yeah. I saw it from my window. It was a really, really, really big tentacle. Of course I did. I really, really, really saw a tentacle. A really big one. Stop by the ocean? It's really big. It's like a lake, only a lot bigger. Yeah, imagine not. And the water is not that greenish dark color. It's really beautiful and light blue. Once we get up over this next hill, you'll see the ocean. I cast Disguise Self. Basically me, only human. All the same, only yeah. Blue skin's gone, horns are gone, no tail. Cute little bob, but it's black hair instead. Yeah. What? No, it stays right there. It goes in and-- Most birds do that, Fjord. Do you know how to swim, Beau? Caleb's naked! We can still see your weenie! I can see it! Oh god! He's bleeding so much! There's so much blood! You just leave them dead? What? Oh, no, I have Nugget with me, weasel's little Sprinkle. Sprinkle is here. Yes. Like on a doughnut. Yeah. I want to play fetch with Nugget, here at the beach. I want to train Nugget to blink back to us. Oh god. I'm so scared. 17. Yeah, this is so wonderful. He looks like a professor. Oh, wow. TRAVIS and It's like us when we went scuba diving. There is no comma, there is no comma! There is a comma. There is a comma! I know what I'm talking about, get in there. No! Don't you want to see my mom, though? I mean, I can go see my mom alone if you guys want to-- I cast Sending. Hey, Mom. I'm sort of in the wat-- at the beach right now. Well, not in the water, but I was wondering if you're singing tonight or if you're singing tomorrow-- (excited gasp) My mom is singing tonight, you guys. She doesn't sing every night, you know, so if we miss it, we might miss it for a while. No, it's a special occurrence when she performs. Oh yeah! Because I think your bandages might come off in the water. Oh, yeah! You know, Nott, you also have that fabulous ring. You could just walk out onto the ocean. Maybe you should find out! That is true. Guess you should have come here sooner. Oh. I thought you meant the abyss of my backpack. Are you high? Are you high on the ocean? How long of a drive is it-- of a cart ride is it to the-- Whatever way is faster. Let's do the wharf. I cast Disguise Self before we get up there. We came to see the Ruby of the Sea perform tonight, ha! Yeah! I'll use the red dice for the Ruby. 15? We hail from Port Damali. I am Fiona Fancypants! Theater critic extraordinaire! That fell out of my hands, it doesn't count. Oh, it's the same roll! Shit. Seven. Oh no, but she's performing soon, and we're going to miss it if we go all the way around! (singsong) Here we go, we need some money. Let's see how much I have. I have five gold to put in his hand? That's a lot of gold, isn't it. I don't know, here you go! As long as I've been alive. I don't know. You don't know how old I am, Caleb? I thought it would have been obvious. And I turn around and walk away. Yeah, a few weeks ago. Well, he grew up in a whole different city. Well, only after I left here. The Opal Archway! No, you go. I'll just repeat it. It's okay, most of the crownsguard here don't really give a shit. When they get stationed out here, they're like, "Okay, okay" and they do the fun stuff too. Well, here's the thing. You can steal stuff if you want, Nott, but the laws are enforced a little bit stricter here. What else is there, really, between stealing and murder? Oh, that's a good one. Oh, right. It was right on the tip of my tongue. We get lots of visitors all the time. Does it seem like the same amount that's always been there? 13! (whispering) There's probably diplomats there tonight. She hasn't started yet! You guys! Sure, but if you don't hear singing, she hasn't gone yet! No? I never had to. So yeah, it's probably free. Yeah! Well, I mean, it wasn't a hotel to me. We had a lot of the top floor. You mean like as a human? Or would they know me as a me? Well, yeah, of course they would. Well, I'm disguised. Yeah. Okay. Has it been an hour? Well, two more since-- wait. Okay. Okay. I just recast it. What do you mean, how are we going to get in? We go in. They don't know you; they know me. And I don't even look like me. What? I thought it was just a thing. Yes, we're going to be staying here. It's an owl. What is that for? No, that's for money. For this particular thing, I think it was. It looks like we're really well off, though, that's good. They're staying with me. I'm not giving these things up. Well, the weasel is tucked in, so really no one will notice it. But yes, I'm walking in with a dog. My mom will want to meet him! No, blink dogs don't pee. It's a rule. It's canon! Yeah! His name is Sprinkle. Yeah. It's really pretty. It's basically the nicest kind you can get. It's really fancy. Isn't it pretty? I used to run up and down these stairs late at night. Or Marion. Yeah! I do. Sure, I recognize that bartender and that bartender and-- Yep. A couple of them have been upstairs, if you know what I mean. The lady of the night, if you will! Yeah, and considering that she's singing tonight, it seems really empty in here! What's that about? She doesn't do that. It would cost a lot of money! What?! We should probably get a table as soon as possible. Where's the backstage door? Where do I get to my mom? I want to go upstairs. Yeah. Well, she comes down from those stairs, so make sure you got a good view of that. I go up to it! I knock on the door and say Good evening, Marion Lavorre! The Little Sapphire has come to see you! I'm here to see the Ruby of the Sea. I know, tell her that I'm here. I know, tell her. Tell her. (shouting) The Little Sapphire's here to see you, Ruby! It's me! Excuse me, Nadine. I run forward and give her a big hug. (whispers) It's a spell! I'm actually still me, don't worry. I missed you so much! I wanted to come home sooner, but we got distracted because we went to the Empire. Oh that's right, I sent you messages! Yeah! It's really cold and the people are pretty strict, but there's some really nice people that you can meet. I met a lot of friends! You should meet them. They're downstairs! Here! I put her hand on my horn so she can tell it's there. Is it okay with--? Be careful of the weasel. His name is Sprinkle, Mama. I'm going to say I left Nugget downstairs with you guys. Yeah. I will of course! Do you want me to finish lacing you up? Your performance is tonight. We went to a town, and it was burned down and we killed a bunch of gnolls and we took off their ears. Then we went to another city and we fought these fish people in this swamp and it was really crazy. Oh my gosh, you should meet this monk girl that I know. She's crazy and she fights with her fists and also with a staff and she's really strong. There's this other girl who has wings. And I tell her all about it. Fighting so much; you should see how strong I've gotten. Well, I mean, okay. Do you want me to punch you? You look beautiful, Mama. Oh right, I can't disguise myself anymore, though. Can I borrow a cloak or something? Shit. Okay, that's all that I'll do. I'll cast it again. All my spell slots. Okay. I run back downstairs. She's almost ready! She's so beautiful. Yeah, no, of course she was. Sure! Yes, of course she is. Yeah. No, I've never seen them before. Have you eaten any of this cheese? It's really good. Oh! Thank you. I told you I was rich. Do you tip here? I never really get to watch from down here. I see it. Yeah, nice. Good luck. Isn't she wonderful? Turn your fucking thing away from me. It's hurting my heart. I know! Oh, I don't know. We never counted it. Well, I mean, she lives here. But she gets paid for other things, and the tips from the singing. The singing pulls in the other things. You know what I mean. That's her Thaumaturgy. I do. I make the lights flare just a little bit. Keep your pants on! Are you all in love with her now? Well yeah, she sang to me all the time. Sometimes. Mostly it was just her, though. Be that pretty, and graceful, and sing really good, and have a bunch of people think she's wonderful? No, of course not! I like myself just the way I am. Thanks, Beau. Thanks, Fjord. When did you hear me sing? Oh, that's right. I did sing for you. You're welcome. Yeah, big scary dude. Well, of course. Usually, after the performance is taken by other things. (singsong) He probably got turned away, because my mom was already taken. It's kind of a wait list, but usually she only has, you know, a few patrons during any given period of time. So she'll have the best diplomats that come to town and if they've claimed that time then they can spend time with her for an entire week or even more and nobody else will come to see her. You know what I mean? Sometimes. There's a lot of people that want to marry her, and have tried to court her and stuff like that. But she only ever, you know, said yes to my dad. Yeah, there's lot of security guards around here, unfortunately. It would usually-- you know, she'd come tuck me into bed, late at night, afterwards. Sometimes I would already be asleep, but she'd come in and say, "I'm just saying good night to "you, love." Then she would go, and then we'd wake up, and sometimes we'd have breakfast, but sometimes we wouldn't and then sometimes she was gone for a few days at a time because the people here, they don't really want to know about their daughters or anything like that. So I would stay hidden, she would tell me to, and then sometimes she'd be free and then we could have lunch or something. I can send a message or-- tell you what. I'm not going to waste a spell slot. I'm just going to run upstairs and tell Nadine to not disturb my mom, but to ask if it's okay if I come by tomorrow, maybe. What! Really? Mama, that's so wonderful. I'll be right back. Can they come upstairs? Do you know if we can stay here tonight? We'll see what they think. I run downstairs. (shouting) You can talk to her tonight! We can go back upstairs, come on. I turn back around and go running back upstairs. We could stay here forever if we wanted to. This is Fjord. I meet him earliest. He's a half-orc and he's growing his teeth back and he's very handsome. This is Beau. She's really strong. She's the one I was telling you about that can fight things with a stick. This is Caleb. He's a wizard. He has a lot of fire and stuff. He likes his books and he used to smell bad, but he doesn't anymore. He likes water now. This is Nott. She's very very brave, even though she's very small. Be careful of your rings. That's right! Because we are detectives and we're really good at solving cases. She's my partner in crime. (whispers) This is what she really looks like. See? You are adorable. And this is Caduceus. He's got pink hair! He used to live in a cemetery. He doesn't know a lot of things. (whispering) He doesn't know anything about sex. (louder) And he drinks dead people tea. I know! They've saved my life, you know. And I've saved theirs because I'm a really good cleric. Did you know that I do that now? I can heal people, Mom! Oh, no he's not here. The healing? Yeah! I know, yeah! Oh hold on, let me go get the aerator. (gasps) I can't wait to hear them! What happened with Lord Sharp? Did he cause too much of a stink? Yeah. We do really good things most of the time, though. We should show her the letter. Yeah, like remember we told you we were detectives. Oh, not at all. Go for it! Yeah, it says Evantica. We'll figure it out. Socialization? Why, Mama? What are you talking about?! Was he the guy that was here tonight? We lure him outside of the Chateau, and then we kill him. I don't want him to hurt you, Mom. Maybe we can get him to fall in love with someone else. Yeah, but that links it back to her. His great servant beneath the city? What was his last name? Really? You guys will stay here? Mama! They're going to take care of you! That's why I ran out of money. Thank you for sending that package, by the way. No, no, no. It's fine! We do a really good job. Have you heard of him, Mama? He's blue as well, and he's always sweaty. Dark hair. Yeah. He's always really wet. Was he nice, or was he not nice? Yeah? Wait a minute. But not The Gentleman, though. He has dark hair. He's got black hair that's really long. No! Oh my gosh, okay. Well, he lives in Zadash, and he lives in a bar, and he's got long black hair, and he's really charming, but kind of snarky at the same time. He wasn't in the Leaky Tap! No, no! We have a gift for him or something? We have many gifts or something? I never asked. He did wear lots of rings on his fingers. Babenon? I didn't ask if that was his name, though! Babenon. Babenon Dosal. But you said he lived in the ocean? Oh my god. What if The Gentleman is my dad? Well, we don't know for sure. Do you have a picture of him? Do you have a drawing of him? I've got a drawing of The Gentleman in my sketchbook! Well, this is pure gold, what's happening here. It looks like Daria. Jester's a really good drawer, even though I'm not. Imagine this is, like, DaVinci. That is him! He has our blood. Yeah, he's in Zadash! Do you want to go see him? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh! I'm going to send him a message, okay? And then we can see if it's him. I send a message to The Gentleman. Oh my god, oh my god. Is your name Babenon Dosal? Have you ever been to the Menagerie Coast? Oh my god, do you know the Ruby of the Sea? Oh my god! No, he's gotten my messages before; he knows it's me. I've seen him having sex and stuff. We haven't seen it, but we know. But I wanted him to be true to her forever. I'm going to try one more time. What do I have? Is it nighttime already? Okay, I'm going to think about what I'm going to say on this one. I'm using my pearl of power. It's my last 3rd-level spell. Okay. Hello Gentleman. This is Jester. Please respond. Just yes if you've seen the Ruby. Please. Is that 20? Oh, oh shit! Balls! (laughter) That's preposterous, he says. I didn't even think to ask about him in Zadash, because I thought he would be in the ocean. Yeah, he told Mama he was in the ocean! Decades? Holy shit. Of course I know how old I am. I'm just questioning my mom's math, is all. I stretch! Not a freebie. Goodnight, Mama. Well, kind of stupid for not thinking to ask The Gentleman when we met him, but-- I did think it was fun that we were meeting somebody else who was blue. Are there? That's true. Why would I need a swim? Oh. Really? It's actually pretty dangerous to go through the Skews at night. They're not webbed. What if he's my dad, you guys? Is that bad that I put that out there? I'll just send him messages every day. TALIESIN and It's going to be so long before we go back to Zadash, maybe. Okay. I guess so. It's pretty late. Yeah, sure. Just that he was very charming, and that he wore lots of rings on his fingers, and that, you know-- Well, that he lived on an island in the sea. And they were going to get married. He said he wanted to and he went to prepare his house and never came back. She thought maybe something bad happened to him. But she said he was very charming and very sweet and very funny. He always made her laugh. I am. She's really wonderful, isn't she? We should go to sleep. Great! I slept really good. That he stops. Okay. Okay, what's your idea? That's perfect, but then I might have to stay with him. I don't want to do that. I wonder where the Concord-- yeah, where they're based. Isn't there a headquarters? The Marquis? Okay. Yeah, why are we talking to the Wharfmaster? I'm so confused. Let's go. I'm going to the lighthouse, I said. It's really pretty. We should go inside. I wonder if it looks like-- you can still tell that there's boobs from the inside. (snickering) Maybe you can sleep in one of the boobs. Let's go! (knocking) (knocking louder) It's haunted! She's a really big beacon. Hi. Do you sleep in the boob? It's really nice. So this is kind of like a temple then? You climb all these stairs all the time? What are we supposed to ask about? Oh, it's her eyeballs. Just kidding, it's where her clavicle is. This is a really good home. You get a lot of visitors here? Really? But it's so cool inside, why don't people want to come see you? It's my mom. A mother, so there's your in right there. Algar. Do you see where he goes? Do you know where he lives? Can I look through your spyglass please? Easily distracted. It's shiny. Aw! Why, though? 11. Why, though? At the Sluice. Oh. I don't want to be arrested. You're not hideous. You're wonderful and you're beautiful on the outside, too. I think you're beautiful. That's the laughing thing she said. Does she start walking us down the stairs? I'm not trying to gank the telescope. Maybe I am. Well, I wanted to-- before she started ushering us out-- to Invoke Duplicity. And make it look like I was in front her but really stay behind. Oh, I'm going to give myself the Blessing of the Trickster. Motherfuck. No. Eight. Not stealthy. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm coming downstairs. Okay. Shit. Have you heard of our lord and savior, The Traveler? She's pretty cool. I liked her a lot. She loved us. We were great. Me and my duplicate skip away. How long have we been outside now? I'm doing my Disguise spell and keeping it up the whole time. That probably would be smarter than what I'm doing. Wizard's tower! Flank up it! Lead us to the carpet! Aren't you supposed to fall gracefully as a monk, then? Ay, that's Beau. Maybe we can blink into it. It doesn't. It's underwater or something? We need to get a boat, but we can't just go there because we'll be arrested. Don't know, the old lady said that. Yeah. Something like that, submerged gates or something. Mm-hmm. No, The Skew is a place where you can live. We should go there! We're stupid, we could have gone there already. Algar. Well, you've already got seven dead birds. Has Yussa ever come to see my mom sing? Let's find the bar, please! Poof! Oh! Poof! That was so close, that was really close to us that time! Ugh. Fuck! So awesome! Everybody was so cool in there! I know, right? I made up everything in that city, guys. You said it was grayish, right? We should ask if we have many gifts to offer and see if a trap door opens or something. Yeah, that was a lot of stuff.
