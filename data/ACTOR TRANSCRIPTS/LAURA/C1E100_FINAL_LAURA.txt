They'll be here forever. Kit Buss! He was wonderful. Renee Zellweger was phenomenal. Who's that? Yeah, there's definitely-- all the links are on geekandsundry.com. Can we talk-- can we talk about this thing now? Oh, well, thank you for asking, Matthew. Well, number one, we have our amazing Scanlan concert tees. As being worn by the buff and glorious Sam Riegel. Gorgeous. Just gorgeous, with all the tour cities on the back and everything. And then, also, a commemorative item for the hundredth episode. We worked with David Mack-- Who is, like, this amazing artist. He's-- you know him. Tell some of his work, 'cause-- Jessica Jones, I saw Jessica Jones work. Kabuki. All of it. So he does this amazing watercolor work and he did an amazing art print for us, so-- Without further ado. (cheering) I mean, I'm so excited about this. Number one, just because it looks so freaking amazing. But then, he incorporated all of this amazing stuff like quotes and everything that has to do with the characters, and things that mean so much to us as the characters. And he just worked with us nonstop to try to make the most amazing thing for you guys, and I'm so proud of it and so happy. And we have this amazing gold emblem in the bottom. I don't know if you can tell, but it's like extra shiny and fancy. It's a special Vex. And the paper's really heavy, and so it's super, super special. So-- It looks like he painted it on the page. Venetian silk. So yeah. This will be available for one month and one month only in the Geek and Sundry store starting today. And then after that, it is gone. And we're doing the same thing that we did last time, which is also offering a limited edition signed version, so if you guys want to check that out, that's only available for three weeks so we can try to get as many signatures before Ashley has to leave. So yeah, three weeks from today you can get the autographed. Starting today, only for three weeks, and then it's gone forever from the store. We already have copies, yeah. Thank you David. Thank you for being amazing. We love you. We should show them. We should let them talk about it. Those are cupcakes, Tary! Mm, delicious. Wait, wait, can you see me? There it is! So we had the aprons made, which we're so excited about. I didn't do it, Ben did it, and he's amazing. Ben did this! He made cupcakes with the Slayer's Cake logo for us for the 100th episode. We can eat them! So I'm passing them around. I'm just so excited about this, you guys! I kind of just wanted to get the apron made so I could personally have it. I don't know if I want to wear this the whole episode. I might. I'm going to hang out. Oh yeah, save a cupcake for Jon. Wait, Matthew! It's hard to remember because it's been such a long time since you said it. What were you thinking? Our infographic is no longer valid! No, no, no, maybe Vax needs glasses to see in the dark. Ah, you're hitting me with your shoulders. That's amazing. You're phenomenal! No, we're right outside the Sun Tree, just before we've left Whitestone. You're so brilliant, darling. I think we should probably head out. Where are we going, Scanlan, again? Shadowy Mountain? Sure, I'll note that Trinket is coming as well, even though it's a fucking given. I mean, just kidding, I love you Tary. Well, Scanlan? Does Aes wear this stupid headband? Because it's really fucking distracting. You're so scary and big. Do you have a place that you always stay? That's what I figured. You didn't touch him this entire year? Ten minutes is so awkward! I feel like I would have abstained from the ten-minute group hug. Thanks, Kiki! No, no, no, Percy brought me in. Oh, I thought we knew we were going to Ank'harel so we dressed for it. That's what we said the last episode. That's what you said, actually. You said "you all showed up dressed for Ank'harel." I feel like you said it? Yes, yes, yes. Be pleased! Where do we go? That was awesome. We're working out the ingredients. What'd you roll? What'd you roll? You guys really should plan this out better. (clears throat) Twins. Funny. Motherfuck. Oh, you know, like 11. Good to see you again. Shit. Is she buff now? Shit. How long have you been here? Why don't you want to sell beautiful things? What kind of potions you got available? Healing potions? Just in case you run away. I have three regular healing potions and that's it. I think we're pretty much out. You have 375 grams? Grams of gold? Oh. I see. So no healing, then? Let's just go? No, no, no, I called it. Tickle-tickle-tickle! But I don't wanna break it! Don't pull so hard that you break it! You motherfuck! Oh, no. Nine. What did I get? What is it? What's that mean? Do you already wear a necklace? I already wear a necklace, so I probably can't wear it, huh? You can get up. It's okay, you can go. You've got 30 feet! Oh jeez, that's so cool. Do you already wear a necklace, Grog? Do you have to attune to it? I've got three for the party, it's not for me. I have none for myself. Okay, okay, okay. So everybody take one? Oh, jeez. Everybody but Keyleth take one? I'm just holding this necklace. I have a necklace on, I can't wear it. Can you wear it? Well then, let me give it to you. Well, now you have it. I thought you said you already wore a necklace! Are we heading out immediately? I don't know why I asked for potions when we had four fucking potions. Lionel. The Crutch. Sorry, I was looking at necklaces. Not Misty Step. Wind Walk. You have to ask him. All of them? I'm surprised it's not working, honestly. That's the most chill I've ever seen. No, they are. Wait, but how many people can you do, because we also have Doty. Yeah, Trinket's in the necklace. Oh, shit. Taryon and Scanlan. Let's go! Do we have to join hands for this? We should probably concentrate for just a minute. I'm gonna turn back, just so I can shout out, we should all follow-- you know how to get there, right, Lionel? Bob up and down if it's a yes. Okay. We're going to follow you, all right? And when it's ready to land, then just hover down, and we'll all follow your lead. That's totally normal. We all do it. All right. Survival check. We might get lost? Don't get us lost! Plant la-la-la. I'm picturing beautiful Bob Ross mountains. Just lightly touch. I go down and do it, too, 'cause he did it. Is this where it is? It looks like it was caved in, actually. Don't be so hard on yourself, Lionel. Are there ducks here? Are there any kind of tracks around, or footfalls that look like it was recent? And it's a mountain! I can roll that one again. Yeah, that's way better! 27! I think I've picked something up. Should we follow it now or should we-- -- camp out and do it in the morning. Wait, you can call them to you? That's a power, that's amazing. Could you call multiple to you and they pick you up and fly you through the air? No, I can tell, his body language is super chill for a duck. I'm just gonna stealthily start following the path around. 29. Can I search for one? Do I get advantage because it's a mountain? Fucking balls. Perception? No, I want perception. 11. Weird. I wonder if it's an illusion. Can I put my hand on the rocks and see if there's an illusion? What-what! I feel like Vex is really good at finding illusions. Oh, shit! Okay, well, can I put the front of my face through the wall and see what I see? Well, it's too late. Constitution saving throw? That was almost so good, but then it wasn't. Ten. I'm a rogue now, you guys! (coughing) Jenga. Not full Jenga. Don't go through the wall. Can I heal, Pike? There's a thing in there. There's a face, and it sucks your life out. I found a door, though, guys! Don't. I'm not even going to tell you where the door is. I'm not going to tell him where the door is. Nobody touch the rocks! There's a bad door. Just listen for a moment. Bad door. Right in front of me fake, bad door. If you go through it, there is a very bad face that sucks your life out. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to take my Oracle Arrow and crouch down. That's why I was going to crouch down and shoot the arrow super low to the ground. Well, when I peeked my head in, before I got my life sucked out, I didn't see anything in front of me. Did I? Give me shit, and then take off on your own. You should mark off one of your Lucks because you already used it for the day. Maybe you should try sticking your face against some of the sheer rock face. You know what, I should probably find out! And I shoot the Oracle Arrow. No, I don't want to go crazy far. I want to get in, a little bit further to see if I can find any more traps, and see how that face works. 65 percent of my strength is used. I think there's a fire further in. The face is in there. Not to my arrow. But it was there on the wall. No, no, no, Grog, don't! We should dispel it or something. Yeah, see if you can dispel the magic! Yeah, but we shouldn't go in the night. We need to rest. We would have to camp inside the cave-in. Oh, Scanlan! We've been so long without you, I forgot we had it! We're going to go back to the cave-in. Oh, wait, wait, wait! I did have a question. I feel like it might be smart to get my arrow out of there, in case anybody comes out and sees an arrow. But I don't know how to do that. Is there an Unseen Servant or something? No, Scanlan, that's not what I meant. No, I don't want you to go in! It fucking sucks your life out! Do I know how many feet in it went? You got it. Oh, that's a good question. Fenthras, exalted. What? Like 120 feet? Is it that, or is it more? That's really far. No, but how would you do it? How would you do it? I saw eyes. The sockets glowed green and then I got hit. Right. But the eyes glowed. What if it can reach you that far in? You're too big. Do either of you have Dust of Tracelessness? Oh, it's dusty. Was it dusty in there? Thank you. No, I see tracks coming in and out of this place. I know there's people that use this. Maybe we should go back into the other side, then. Unless somebody can just fucking dispel that face, and then we can just go in this way. In the mansion. You've already gone back? Did it hit you that fast? It didn't hit you? Let's maybe move away from the entrance. I peek my head in. Does the flickering light in the distance seem brighter? It's too many choices. Too many dice. Fucking shit, motherfuck! Wait, wait, it's a mountain. No, I'm looking in the fucking tunnel. 31. We could. I think I might have used up its only charge, potentially. Or it's recharging. Does the Glyph of Warding alert you once it's gone off? Oh, right. The guy that was stealing all that gold. Okay, good. Then we are probably safe going in. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us. I'm going to see how many people I can cast it on. Every creature I choose within 30 feet of me! So, sweet, it's everybody. Is Percy back yet? Percy, hold on to my waist, dear. And add ten to it because of Pass Without a Trace. 25. It's because Percy's holding on to my waist. Actually, Doty has the best night vision. He's got complete Darkvision? Oh, we all have Darkvision. We didn't take a nap. Maybe in a little bit. Me and Percy. That's true. What did he roll for stealth? Yes. It's cocaine! If we camp, then they won't find us. They can't see the door. Percy, spread your legs! I let her crawl through us. (sings) You're the best around! Okay, keep going forward. Oh, shit, you were right by fucking other faces when you popped in before! Roll super good. Shh! 22. Scanlan? Maybe now is the time for that door. Yeah. How near do the voices sound? Let's backtrack to the caved-in tunnel. No. Let's backtrack to the caved-in tunnel and set up the door. I thought we were not going to fight, but it's up to everybody else. I'm going to stand at the entrance of the tunnel and guard Scanlan. (singing) Scanlan, open the door. You guys want to camp? Let's go. Like a glyph? Not that hot. Feel like coming to the campsite? Maybe? We can't find the card. Keep an eye. Hop in the mansion? Before we go in, will you throw down the Dust of Tracelessness? Grog. Well. That was fun. Last longer? That's it? That's all they make, is salad? But you run the place. Is the picture still up that Pike commissioned? Is Tary-- does he have his own room, as well? Yeah. Tary, Scanlan. Scanlan, Tary. Scanlan, you can add a room at a thought! He can have your room. I guess so. Should we open it and see what color that is? Just one, because it's all black walnut. Don't fuck up the wrinkles, they look so good in the light! Yeah, because you have a backlight! And a halo around you, because of the shield! Now your hair is extra fluffy because you did it. They know how to make chicken, though, I know the servants know how to make chicken! Fabulous. Oh, shit, did we say that we have to buy chalices before we have any more fucking feasts? Shit balls. We're out of chalices! We've got to remember. We've got to do it. Yes, potentially, or they could have given up. What if we just peek out the door and see? Yeah. I'm going to peek out the door. Very stealthily open the door a little bit and see. Yeah, I'm going to stay inside the door but just look outside the door. Ah, fuck. Shut it. I think it might keep getting worse, I'm not sure. Yeah, some of them are a lot meaner. We could turn some undead. Yes. I want that. I do want it. Yes. Bring it. This fucking sucks. As we're walking towards the rooms, can I pull Pike aside for a second? How are you? Well, I think it's reasonable to be angry. It's a different side of you. Well. Your emotions are justified. But you found it in your heart to forgive your family, and they did terrible things to you. Maybe it's harder with people that are closer. They cut deeper. Have you talked to Sarenrae about it? You don't want to do it yet. He's still charming. I don't know what tomorrow will bring. Probably a battle of some sort, which is usually life-endangering. Just ask yourself if you would want to die without saying how you feel. You'd know a few minutes later when we tried to bring you back. I just spit on you, I'm sorry. It's hard. Well, you know, if you feel like staying up and wandering around and talking to some people-- We haven't been here in a while. Ooh, but like an acai bowl? Is there granola? It's going to catch up when you burp really good. But what if I want it to catch when I burp? Oh, shit. I take off running. What does the Mace of Disruption do to undead? See, this is why you take the time at the beginning to organize. For Divine Strike. Quick, use your spells! Destroy Undead! Nice! Yay. Do you roll for all 15? Don't confuse him. It's a lot to keep track of. Hey guys, we have these amazing art prints by David Mack. I nudge Scanlan. I sh-- I'm going to hold it. All right, I'll shoot one of the skeletons. Oh, I just decided maybe I shouldn't hit them, though. Because I rolled a one. (laughter) Oh no, it's the chicken-Scanlan incident all over again. You know what? I'm going to leave it. It's for them. I got a blood blister on my arm. Don't say that! Oh no. That was a lot of skeletons that you killed, Pike, with that spell. That was really good. He can read. It depends on if there are long words. Do you know what he sang? Whoa. Grog, I didn't hear it. Maybe you should sing it, and let him know what it was. A free massage. I cast Pass Without a Trace on everybody. Well, I don't want to close the door to the mansion, but turn out the lights in the mansion so you can't see. (whispering) Wait, I shoot-- Shit. We sneak out. We sneak out and shoot them from behind. If you feel like it, you can go. This is a team. Yeah. 27. Plus ten? No! Pants and boots and pants. I bramble shot one of them. I'll go for the further one. Should I roll two for attack? Ooh. So, Oh! I'm an assassin too! So I get an automatic? Sweet!! Ooh, so I double all my dice? Oh shit! 66 on the first hit. For the arrow, yeah. Oh wait, I didn't do my sneak attack damage! (cackling) 76 for the first hit. We check it for traps. Okay. He did. We need to have Tary Identify it. Can we drag the box back to the mansion? Can we hide the bodies? Yeah. And Dust of Tracelessness to hide where they were dragged. Yeah, Grog. Don't touch any of it, until we get Tary to look at it. Do you have a picture? I spilled coffee on my paper, and it looks like David Mack watercolor. We go back to Tary. Tary? We're in the mansion. Tary? Tary. I've seen you naked. What are you doing in here, why didn't you come down with us? You can go, you can go, you've got 30 feet of jack. Whoa, go us! Shut up. Is it attunable? Do you have to attune it? We're in the room, we're in the room! Tary. I'm your best friend. Oh wait, is it a necklace? Tary, you've never been quite so obsessed with your dick before. You're doing it! How are you? You've been hiding a lot! Oh no! You're not there! You're my best guy! I mean, you were poorer without knowing us, you just didn't realize it. This mansion disappears in 24 hours, so you can't just hide in here. I feel like Percy would like this a lot. We found something that you might enjoy. I put this on. We should go attack things. And head deeper in, see where the people have been. Still have Pass Without a Trace going. Natural 20! Natural 20. But he's in a mansion, he'll just pop out and then he'll be sitting in a tunnel by himself! Sorry, Matt. What do we do? He's going to kill him! He's going to kill one of them! What should we do? Searching, keeping an eye out for any other people as well. God damn it. Oh no. 16? Well, if anything's going to bring more skeletons, it's that. Should you heal us before we pop into anything more? Can you heal us? That was a lot. Maybe we'll have to fight things outside of the ziggurat. What the fuck? But it's a doorway. I shot an arrow through it. Moving forward. Keeping an eye out for those-- No, she wanted to summon an elemental. I pop Trinket out. Can I hear the noise of the ziggurat coming from either side more? What about wind or anything? Do we see faces on either side? 28. Maybe. I feel like there's traps. I'll go right. Do they see us? Do they only see that side? Do they see us come around the other side of the pillar? They see all of us. How far away is the ziggurat? It's such a big map. Wait, we didn't do this last time, did we? Wait, so it's reversed? So when we tell you which direction we want to go, Matt, it's from your perspective. Can I see whose voice that was? That was crazy. 27. Familiar? No! How?! Dun dun dun! I know. 14. So pissed! It's a giant-- Working your way back up. Anti-magic dome. Are you both wise? Roll your advantage. You get advantage. Try it. Maybe you'll roll a natural 20. It's hard to keep track of three characters. Has anybody tried shooting anything through the orb? Okay. Well, I'm going to try Hunter's Marking Delilah. I don't? Okay. I'm going to try to shoot an arrow, then, at where I remember her being. Because it's red. Natural 20! Oh, what a waste. Because it was red. Motherfuck. Okay, then I'm going to Hunter's Mark that big guy and I'm going to shoot him with a flaming bowstring. Are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, when it didn't fucking count! You motherfuck. Don't rub it in my face when I just rolled a one. No, he has to wait because he's going to get hit. He's going to get bludgeoned. I am going to move back into the little corner that's next to me. Yeah, and Trinket will follow me in there. Shorthalt! Who? I suck tonight! I can't help it! Oh, I can add inspiration! Okay. No, that's not going to save me. Ten. Trinket. No. She's at the bottom. Don't jinx this. What works on Feeblemind? Tiberius had it one time. How did we heal him? It's cultists and Delilah left? Okay. If it's doable to pass through a magic barrier. Is it an action to drop anti-gravity? They'll all get bludgeoning damage from the fall. I'm not on the ceiling. Oh no, it's a whole rainbow! Oh my god. You're going to another plane! Okay. I'm going to take aim at the other cultist. I'm going to Hunter's Mark them. That's the old one with the staff? But they're holding a staff? I'm going to bramble shot that one. No. Yeah, I'm going to bramble shot the one that I haven't seen his face yet. That was a 33. Okay. (counting) Nobody's standing next to him, right? (counting) 27. So 27 damage, and then DC of 17. Strength DC of 17. But he's holding the staff, still? Okay, I'm going to hit him again. I can't fucking add! 22? I know. Do I get sneak attack because he's restrained? That was the shittiest additional four. Oh no. I don't have any idea what I rolled before that. Oh god. I'm so sorry! (counting) This is so much better than the first roll. 23, and then. 33. I'm going to get on my broom. No, but I'm going to be ready to. I Hunter's Marked him, too, didn't I? I didn't add my Hunter's Mark on either of those attacks. An additional seven for Hunter's Mark. I assume we didn't hear that terrible pun from inside the orb of death? She can attack. Oh, she can't attack. What if you die? She's hiding in the ball. We can't get to her. The orb, they went into the orb! That's how they got over here! Yay! The most lackluster how do you want to do this! (laughing) That is the stupidest death! No! She turned it into that. She succeeded on the previous one. This a pathway into some other world now. We can't do anything in here. Okay, let's take the cadaver outside. We fucking killed her. How did we kill her before? How did she die? Like, she fully fucking died. Holy shit. What if it's not really her? Well, she can Greater Restoration her as soon as we walk outside. I mean, you could try. Stop what? Well, we can't go through now. Oh, fuck. But, we're not even healed. They just went through. We're going to go through and just die immediately. It was just a doorway? That's what I saw through the other one! Can we back out and see how far the range goes? Is it the same distance as our ziggurat? Yeah, one of the bodies. Just full on her lips. Eww! Fucking gross! I help. Trinket helps, too, because he's stronger. Or the blade, the sphere! There's only two more questions left. Not Ripley. Delilah. It's stupid! Or, do they have plans to attack through the orbs? Or how many orbs are there on this plane? Yeah, are there plans to come through the orbs? Nah, he wouldn't know that. Great. Is that the longest we've ever gone? Yeah, for sure. Thank you, Marvel Puzzle Quest!
