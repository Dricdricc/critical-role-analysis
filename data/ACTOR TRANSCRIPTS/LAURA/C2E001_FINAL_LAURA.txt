As in nnnn. Thanks, Sam! We have cubbies! (yells) Okay. Yes, I do. It's a new campaign, new us, new merch. I don't know which camera I'm looking at. So we released our teaser on socials, and everybody was like, "I want that as a poster!" So we listened to you, and we made it a poster! (cheering) It's a real poster! Look at this lameness that you could have on your wall! So yeah. It's in the store right now, you guys, and we printed a small amount, so those ones will be shipped faster, and then after that it'll just be pre-order, but I think it's all listed as pre-order, so just so you know. No. But let's just talk about this Matthew Mercer. So we can be with you always. Matt can stare at you while you sleep. Oh yeah. We've got to be careful, guys, because we have a lot of people that haven't watched the last campaign, or haven't finished the last campaign, so no spoilers for last campaign. Oh, so you can listen to it in the morning and watch it live at night. If you have a lot of free time. Or a really long drive, maybe. I'm going to throw up. We have Emerald City Comic Con, me and Travis. Wait, we're going to give-- oh, that's-- That's a lot of pieces of paper! Why didn't you put them on the same piece of paper? Yeah, they're with Heirloom Photography, and they did all of our thumbnails, too. They did that poster. Oh my god, no pressure! What color are your eyes? I need visual. We've just been sitting here this whole time! Of course, take a seat. (Slavic accent) Oh, well, okay. I'm just, you know, a little blue tiefling, that's all, with blue hair. And I'm wearing a pretty cute dress, that's all. And I'm having a good time, you know? We're just having a good time here at breakfast. You're very handsome. I just need to tell you. Jester. So cool! Well, I mean, he did go around to a bunch of people. That was a lot of work on his part. I would hate to make him go back to all of those people and give it back to each individual person. Divide it up. So I'm leaving it to you to do that counting. Which is really hard for me, personally, but there you go. Don't know. So two for each of us! That's great. It's hard not being the treasurer. Tell you what, you do that math. Who is watching us? Are you guys staying here? It's very true, we have a hard time seeing things that aren't moving, it's very true. But I can hear you. You should take a bath. You know they have showers here. It's possible. You bathe yourself in water. It's because you smell really bad, and it's wafting over this direction. I'm just letting you know. I would hate if I smelled that bad and someone didn't tell me. Hi! I'm Jester. Nice to meet you, Caleb. How much silver did I just get? Woo! (laughter) Whoa. 22. I haven't even flipped over my character sheet yet. This is crazy. Yes? I just thought you said my name, is all. Oh, yes. Lots of baked goods if you have them, please. I really like them. Okay, cool. What is he saying? I mean you, you're a girl. What is she saying? Shit. That's really hard to remember now. Yeah, what did you just say? Do you have the mask covering you? She's a goblin?! I didn't ask why she was wrapped up. No, nobody asked. I didn't think we were going to meet you so soon! We saw your tent going up! We did! Do you perform? (gasps) I was going to ask if you read fortunes! Can you do one now? (gasps) Oh my gosh, you're so smart. Look at this guy, he knows everything! Stay clear of Baumbauch. They're dicks. Do you know my name? Jester. What is your name? Molly. Look at this guy. I would love one. Yes. How much do you want? Two copper, okay, I just got some copper. Here you go. Oh my gosh, really? That's what everyone always tells me. What is that? Wow! You know, we did just defeat a really big snake? So maybe there's even bigger things coming up, you know? (gasps) Oh my gosh! Look at that! How did you even do that? Will you ask the cards if I'm going to find him? Him. I'm looking for my dad. Really? Wow. Does it say how long ago I found it? Because that's-- That's going to take a lot of thinking. I can't wait! It's going to be so much fun. It's a big tent. It would take a lot of work. When is it? How long is it? When is it? Well, we have plans tonight! Do you stinky people want to come with us? It's going to be so much fun. Look at all these friends we're making here. This is a good city. She was really, really cool. Did you see that cool thing she had going on with her chin? That's interesting. I wish I would have thought of something like that. So she doesn't know I copied. I can't do it tonight. Wow. Cool. What do you guys want to do now? (laughter) I don't know. No. No, I'm not superstitious at all. Why? By the way, did you open your Christmas present from me? You should go open it! Yes! Go grab the bag! What? Why would you recognize the cloaks? Caleb, are you going to go the Academy? Really? A cat? Or her name! Aw! Can I call him Lumpy? Look at this Lumpy! Made in England. (laughter) That's so great. I can do things, too. Yeah. Like-- Like-- oh, gosh. Okay. I'm going to use Thaumaturgy and I'm going to make all the windows in the place open up really fast, like crash open. You're right. I'm sorry. I use Thaumaturgy and I close all the windows. (laughter) Ta-da! Come see me tonight at the carnival! I'm really good! But he's a magic cat. How can you be allergic to magic cats? --for cat dander? Yeah, I mean, he's learning. He's getting really good at it. Yeah, you should have seen him. He disguised himself the other day, and it was like, (clicks tongue). Well, he's going to learn. I'm not going to go to the Academy. Yeah, that one. How long have you had yours? Wow, that's cool. A frickin' cat! Can I see one of your books? We know it's rich people that go there. We have to find a way to get you in. Well. We had more. What's the name of it again? Have you played it? I'll teach you someday. It's so much fun. Yes. I mean, I can teach you, if you want. Okay, I'll deal! Yes, sure, this will be fun. Okay. You draw three cards. Well, I give you three cards. So you use 3d6. Yeah. Okay. So hide your roll from me, because we can't know. So first you have to ante up. How much coin do you want to put in? Oh, great! How much do you want to front him? A silver. Okay, this is great. Okay. Am I doing this right? Now I'm going to give us three cards, so we both roll, but we can't see. That's good. Okay. Bluffing. How do you know I wasn't? No, wait, there's rules! No, he totally did it. She totally did it. This is really hard, Sam. But, you know, that's my skill, too. So I'm going to try to do it as well, 'cause that's my skill as well. I did not notice him doing it. Okay, so I'm going to try to reroll one of my three, too. Oh, right. Oh, shit. 13? Okay. So the best hand you can get is three of a kind. Then, after that, it's a straight. A high straight. Then a low straight. Then it's if you get all evens, or if you get all odds, then it's two of a kind, then it's nothing, it's just high card. Okay, but now we put in a second amount, because you can up the ante, and you get one more card. No, but wait, wait, wait. You can put in more money, and then I deal you a different card. You get to give a card back, and then I deal you another card. One more silver. Okay, I'll keep it low, too, because you're only doing the one. So I only put in one silver, too. Yes. And now give one of your dice back, whichever one you don't want, and roll it again. I don't want to reroll any. Okay. Now you show what you got and we'll see who wins. I got three fives. No, it's okay. Just don't do it again. But I'm sorry I took all this money from your friend. Why, though? But I won it. Tell you what. I'll give you-- none of it back, I can't! Okay, here's one silver back-- Okay, but I insist, all the money back. All right, fine, it's mine, thank you. Yay. See? Isn't that the most fun? Right? Oh, wait, is that bad? Well, I only learned last night, you guys. People took my money when I was learning. Oh jeez, now I'm definitely giving you your two silver back. Don't worry about it, man. (laughter) Have my baked goods come out yet? I just want to go to the carnival. Should we do it? We've done that. It sucked so much. Well, by mistake. Well, I lost it, but he made so much. Do you guys want company? Do you want us to come and hang out with you today? I can hear you. Bottom line-- and I touch Nott's shoulder, and I cast Blessing of the Trickster. That would be the worst character choice ever. (laughter) You have advantage on all your stealth checks. Because she is all kinds of trouble. What's her name? The creepy doll? No, don't say that. I don't want to see art with you with Annabelle's face. What's a Trost? We just can't go by the Baumbauch ale. Is that the one you need? Oh. Well. Why do you need it? You need a beer? I've got to say, I miss those two people we ran into at the carnival. I don't have very much either. Aw, it's like Ren Faire. That's Vax. That's Vax's dice. No, I gave it back to you, remember? Is this a big shop? While he was talking to the shopkeeper, I'm going to take out as many books as I can and move them around on the shelves, and then take some of them and turn them around to where their binding is facing the inside. Natural 20! I skip out the door. And I cast Blessing of the Trickster on you again, just in case. We came! Am I the only one going, do we really have to give up our weapons? I don't feel okay with this. Magic! [break] Here's the thing. Some of us have weapons that we don't want to pass away to other people, so how much of a chance is it that we could get through without having to do that, you know? Right. And we really want to see the show. But, you know, we are really good at security, like all of us are really strong, and we could fight things that came up, too, so maybe it would be best if you don't take our weapons, and then we could help. So do you want to hire us? We could ask you for days off sometimes. Like, is his mustache especially B.O.-y? Like, what? That's really gross. Ew. I don't want to perceive this. I'm glad I didn't roll very well. Are you in the show, too? Just one dagger? Pinky-swear me, Yasha. Yeah! Now we're best friends. Here's my sickle. She has a really bad limp. How are you carrying all of these weapons? I think it's just stealth checks with the blessing. Sorry, I wish I wouldn't have said it and then you could have had advantage just then, but I'm not a cheater. Are you keeping track of what goes with what person? Because it's a lot. Stop saying the word 'goblin'. People are going to hear you. You're going to hang out with us the whole night? Of course, you know, they're a lot to handle. Yes? What are you telling me? Oh, yes. If I skip around, will I be part of the show and then I don't have to pay? Front and center! As soon as I sit down, I'm going to pull out my sketchbook and draw the moon and the shadow card that Molly showed me. Oh, there's no chairs? Aw. I was picturing benches. That's okay. (whispers) It's like the serpent we fought, you guys! This is really different than most carnivals that I've gone to. Have we ever seen anything like this before? Well, he just described what it looked like. I invoke Duplicity. Oh yeah, we were right in the fucking front row. Look at us! We're so cute! Yay. 21. Oh, wait, 22. Okay. Well, I'm just going to go for it, all right? I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt on the monster that just appeared. Let's find out. You make a ranged spell attack. Okay, okay. Well, it's cocked. It was 20 and then it rolled. That's 11 plus-- what do I add to my-- Guiding Bolt, plus five. So 16. Yay. 4d6. Ten, 16, 18, and then any attacks in the future-- the next attack has advantage. Yeah, it was 4d6 radiant damage. So yeah, it was 18. And then I'm going to run the opposite direction away from him, but I'm going to keep my duplicate up there. That backpack's almost as big as my dice bag. So she's going to stay here. I can't reach that far, but. Oh, shit, sorry. Sorry, I didn't realize it was-- Okay, sounds good. And you get advantage. Isn't Chromatic Orb like a really strong spell? Can I shoot an arrow at Nott? God, somebody's going to get trampled. I mean, it's a fire hazard, for sure. Oh, shit. Okay, we have to keep them from being dead. Oh, god. Taking a stab. Oh, now I'm worried. I'm worried about the undead. I don't know. Well, I don't think I would know this, so it's okay. I'm going to say to the air and say, dude, are you here, because this is like the coolest shit we've ever seen! And then I'm going to cast Toll the Dead on the first zombie creature guy. And there's a bell that tolls. He has to make a wisdom saving throw or take 1d12 necrotic damage. Oh, three. That's lame. And I made that sound like it was coming from my duplicate, and my duplicate's going to run back a little bit and stand next to the pole. Yeah. Okay, but roll again, you have advantage. Hi, Caleb. I like how every time you roll it comes out. Beau, you got this. That's a really pretty dice. There was a sick guy! There was an old sick guy and he turned into a zombie! And I run over and I cast Cure Wounds on Beau. Are you sick too? Did you get hurt? Hold on two seconds. I'm going to cure her and then I'll cure you too. Seven points, that's all I could cure. Oh, that's better for you, ten for you. Can I search the corpse of the woman? Which one? When I'm going "which one?" I make my second form just dart forward and start searching the body. Look at all the stuff that that one's finding over there! (laughter) Not bad. 19? Did I find anything? Shut up. 14? Your little dwarf girl was singing, and she turns people into zombies. (gasps) He does look suspicious. I cast Thaumaturgy and make it sound like there's a sound coming from behind him, too. Natural one. (coughing) There was some popcorn that I ate earlier. (coughing) I have bloody fingers. That was cocked, unfortunately. That was a good one. Oh, well. 16? Yasha will totally kill me. Don't worry, you can leave. (weak laughter) Well, we saw an old guy turn into a zombie. But it's possible that he just died because he was old, and then he had the zombie curse on him and just turned, you know? Because that happens a lot. Shirley. She's really shy, though, and I hear she only talks to tieflings, so you should probably send-- --my brother along, because he's really good with that stuff. Next time we don't help. That's what it comes down to. We have to get Molly out! I used some new dice. Some new dice.
