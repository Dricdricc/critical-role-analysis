I want to see that! Yes! Hey! I don't know if you guys have gone to the store lately but there's stuff in there. The reason that I was talking today is because I was informed that there's actually some more CR dice, not the Vox Machina dice-- those aren't back yet, but the CR dice are in stock if you've been wanting some of those. There's also stickers and keychains and t-shirts-- lots of t-shirts you should check them out-- and notebooks and awesome pencils. That art book and an apron for the Slayer's Cake. Just one apron. Supplies are limited. I haven't seen it in person yet! Hey, and it's the Slayer's Cake apron that I was just-- Yes we will as well as-- You're going to be there too. Because the shaft curves to the right, y'all. Only you. (laughter) Oh no! If this is like a running thing this whole campaign-- Look at that opening, it's so cool looking! Oh that's a little door? That's the door you we're talking about? How old is the child that got pulled out of the room? I'll be behind Fjord. What do we see, though? Frumpkin size or smaller? Did you see that? I saw that. Radiant blast! Sacred Flame, I mean. Don't hit the kid! But you can't see, Beau. Oh, this is for the whole thing. If I'd have known that, I would have rolled better for the whole thing. I wasn't trying so hard. Ten. Oh no, oh no. Ah! You're going to hold your turn? Roll again, because you might get natural 20! Roll again for advantage, you might get a 20. Did you find it? I'm not Beau. I'm Beau number two! I lied! I am not going to do the Sacred Flame, I'm going to do Toll the Dead because that's a wisdom saving throw. To the one holding the kid. That's a wisdom saving throw. Aw, he saves. (rasping) Next time I'm going to really hurt you! I said that in Infernal. I've got to see this dice as you roll it. You weren't even rolling those dice? Yes! The field is ours now! Now it's a horror movie. I was trying to help! That's great! Oh! Okay. I'm going to move forward into the room. To about, yeah, there's good, sure. I'm going to try it again. Did the guy up there get hurt at all? Yes? Then I'm going to cast Toll the Dead at him. Fucking A, piece of shit! It's 13 because I'm lame! I'm going to start unsnapping my sickle to get it out to hit things. Oh no. So cool! Will the hyena get a bite on the kid? Children have no hit points! (singing) Hyenas will bite them. Yes! Okay. Did I see the child go down? Okay. Then I am going to run over to the kid. No, all these other people are helping this kid, so I guess I will too. Somebody better kill that big gnoll, though. I don't. I don't care but now I feel guilty. Should I use my last spell on this kid? I'm going to use a healer's kit to stabilize him. The whole time I'm grumbling like Oh I could have gotten that last Toll of the Dead! It would have heard a really good bell and instead I'm doing this! (laughter) Oh no! Oh my god, Caleb needs glasses! A new prescription! Glasses make you smarter. Your scarf will protect you! Oh no! I should have Tolled the Dead on him. Someone bring me those ears and bring them to my jar! How many gnolls was that we just killed? We only sent one down the hole. Right and then, one hyena set. Do you see what I'm doing? Oh, I saw your bird! (whispering) The Grand Duchess. Can you heal? Do you have healing? Because I'm stabilizing him don't worry, but-- And some doughnuts. I take one and push it onto his face. We're working on it. On a scale from one to ten. What are you wearing? It's a poop hole! He's probably covered in really old poop. Shaft. Oh, speaking of, I stand up and I walk to the door where the little kid was pulled from. Are there any ropes across the door? I knock on the door. Housekeeping! Is anybody locked in here? I think it's the mom. Okay. (turning noise) Yes. Definitely. He's alive, don't worry. Are there any other people that are alive that you know of? Oh. Can we run over to the other door? But he's alive? We're the rescue party. Bad timing. They're safe there? Do you have a cart to get them back to Alfield? All of us together, like a big party? I like it. Yeah. The good bell, not the bad bell. No. Let's do it. Let's throw them down the hole! Now they all look like they just left and had some-- You know, sometimes accidents happen. Yeah, let's search around. How many dead bodies do you think I could carry? I'm going to try to drag some of the dead out-- You need glasses though. Oh nearsighted, I understand. As we're walking them, Nott's going through the pockets. I'm dragging the bodies going, Duchess! Duchess Stacy, please come over to me! Duchess Stacy! Grand Duchess Stacy! Two. I stabilized him. I stabilized him real good. Ooh, I could give someone a blessing, who's shitty at this? Blessing! Roll a 20. With advantage?! Fuck. Oh, Jesus. Oh, that's where you came from? Keep checking for traps, okay? Oh, the Grand Duchess and Frumpkin will be best of friends. I feel like we're seeing more of Caleb's social awkwardness, seeing him from the outside, it's so good. It's really smart that he made a hummingbird. That's really fast. It's a pretty smart move, don't you think? Yeah. I mean, it's really smart. Did you see any survivors? Maybe he's sleeping. Offer her shiny things. Then I give you a Blessing of the Trickster for your stealth. You get advantage, Fjord. We can't hear you, you're fucking 60 feet ahead of us. Should we go down the tunnel? Or should we go to them? Then it would add another hour up there, wouldn't it? I don't really get anything back on short rest. I mean there might be more survivors. We rescued some survivors. We took a rest. Yeah, under short rest, not hit-- You can do it. I go running past them right as they do it and cut its ears off. Thank you. Oh okay. I do that. 15. Do they see us? 16. (whispering) There's a lot more guys out there. I saw three visually. Oh god this means that-- That would be amazing. Oh no. They're coming. (whispering) They were about to look in this direction, but they weren't quite looking in that direction when we dragged the body out. Fjord, what do we do? Can you send the Grand Duchess in? Did she used to be a person and you shrunk her down? Oh no. You can shake the ground, though. He saw the bird come back this way so maybe-- LIAM and Do you know how to do that? SAM and Let's fucking go. I rub her head and give her a little blessing. Don't you worry. You keep hiding whenever you need it. It gives you advantage on stealth checks. Not surprised. I could Sacred Flame him in the exact same time. I pull my sickle out so I'm prepared for actual up-front combat. Which one do you want to hit? The orange one, the gray one, or the black one? We can't see those guys to Sacred Flame them. We could get the one in the back, and then the other two might look at him. Let's do it. I knew it was Blur! At the same time I see his little reed flick, I'm going to swirl my sickle around and cast Toll the Dead. It's a dex save for Sacred Flame and a wisdom save for Toll the Dead. 13. You couldn't have them roll that for me? I really love Crystal Pepsi. Ugh. That's okay. It was for visual anyway. Ten. I got ten. Oh, Fjord. Right as we all ran in at the same time. I'm going to move forward, up to the other side. Yeah, can I see them? You know what? Fuck it. Should I do this? MARISHA and Fuck it. I'm going to climb up the stairs. Then I'm going to Invoke Duplicity! It's going to appear next to the-- yeah, right there. She's going to be like-- Yeah, and then can I use my movement to crouch behind this table? Okie dokie. Okay. Oh shit. Oh no, it's the general! We are outgunned. Doesn't hit me! 17! I put my shield up. What is Aid? Me? There, it's already at 30, so 31?? Sweet. Yeah! Ha. I look over at Beau and I'm like I'm doing you! (whispers) Frosty. Engaged! I'm a really good fighter you guys! Okay. That went really well, so I'm going to run-- Oh, god, there's three of them right there. I know, but-- What am I going to do? I'm going to run into-- Oh, no, that's really dumb. I'm going to use my duplicate and she's going to Toll the Dead. To the orange one. TRAVIS and It's a wisdom saving throw! Roll low! This is a really loud gong. He takes four damage. The orange one. Oh, had he not been damaged yet? I shouldn't have rolled a 12. I should have rolled an eight. Six damage. As a bonus action I did that, so I'm going hop up on the table that I'm next to. Yeah. Shak√§ste, stay forever. Come get me, you coward! It's fine. You're just going to die. (glumly) I know what he rolled. Don't say those things, Marisha. You can do it. Oh god! Drop his weapon, no don't listen to me, do what you want. Yeah, that's pretty good. He keeps his weapons in his hand, though? Could they tell it was my illusion right there? Damn it. Oh. Oh! I'm going to take it. Can he not react either? Okay. I'm going to run forward and attack him because he's not moving at all. Yeah. 16. Four points of damage. It was you! LAURA and Yeah, we do. Wait, what kind of weapon was that guy holding? That's really big. You got up! Wait! Not the pulp, we need the ears! That's three gnoll sets and I'm going to mark one as super special because it's big. Yeah. Thanks, Wyrmwood. Thanks for Marisha. No. Congratulations, Marisha. Rummage through their bodies. I did. I know. I'm doing that. (yelling) Did you see that? That is not cocked. I rolled a one and a two. So yeah. A three for investigation. I'm going to take it. How heavy is it? Who wants this gold? Anybody? Yeah? Here is three gold for you. Here is three gold for you. There's seven gold left. Here's three gold for you. Three gold for you. I've got one gold left. How much silver did you say there was? We got all the ears. Should we search for more survivors and then burn it to the ground? Yeah. Well, we can explode it. You mean search for people? Mine's 13. What should we do? What should we do? I think that means he ate him! Don't think it's going to help. Should we go in? I meant it's-- What are we doing? We're level three! What are we doing? We got to go in, we got to throw some dynamite, get the people out, and run! We got two sticks! And we steal the baby. Yeah. We might kill the mom though, or bury it. Let's get it out, and then collapse the tunnel leading to it. Then they can get stuck in this room. We have one and one. We should make our way towards this, though. They're going to get to the next hostage by the time we get to this room, cause we're 100 feet away from it still. Start walking. Stealthily. Who needs a blessing? Caleb, you need a blessing! You're shitty at stealth right? I bless you. Oh, they're real close to them. I'm in the back! We get the guards out, we get the people out. Oh, we're all going to be in there. You need to sneak in and you need to try to unhook the ropes, okay? You stealth around. They won't even know that you're there while we're attacking. Untie the guards and then we all run. Spiritual Weapon is really good if you have that, that's very badass. I know, but then I have no spells left. I got a first level, y'all! She should sneak in before you do Spiritual Weapon, otherwise it's going to make them aware that something's going on. The Spiritual Weapon will definitely alert them to our presence. Yeah. You make that Spiritual Weapon appear right next to them. You can hit them immediately. You do it right when we do the surprise attack. You sneak in. Yeah. Are you good to sneak? I'm going to bless you. Before you go sneaking around the side. You get advantage, when you go into the room, just in case of a natural 20. 13. Caleb, what's your stealth roll? Okay. Come on, Nott, go. All the way around. Got nothing. They might see you. You're getting really close to the manticore. I'll stand next to Caleb on the inside. Yeah. 18. I'm going to run around to the other side of it. This is so dumb. Yeah. I'm going to hit it with my sickle or whatever! Natural one! Oh no. I'm going to just dance in place. Hits me. I'm going to cast Hellish Rebuke at it as soon as it does it. It doesn't say on my thing. It's a dex save. Oh! 3d10! I'm going to say in Infernal-- I'm going to say-- No, 3d10 because it's cast at 2nd-level when you're doing Hellish Rebuke. Okay, 13. Yeah, in Infernal I say, Oh, you're such a cute kitty! Oh no! Do we get an attack of opportunity? Ah, I'm going to kick it. No, I don't hit it! I rolled a three! He done been paralyzed. (singing) Two steps forward-- Oh, the spell. Spiritual Weapon stays on the field. Once you cast it, it's out there in every single turn, for a bonus action you can attack. Don't give-- Let him decide. Can you do anything while you're paralyzed? Okay. I'm going to Sacred Flame the priest. Sacred Flame is a dexterity saving throw. Yeah! Doesn't matter! Still hit! Six damage of radiant. Pink energy. Is Hold Person concentration? Oh, I can move. Oh yeah, that's right! I could run down and grab my sickle, why not? Oh, that's right. They can't just move. I'm going to run up and engage the priest. Get the baby. Does the Spiritual Weapon get a-- Oh my god. (gasp) Grab Fjord and get out of here. I know, I'm going to cast-- I'm going to cure you. Unconscious. 17. Exact amount. You have one of the healing potions. No, Spiritual Weapon can move 30 feet. Oh, maybe I'm wrong. LIAM and Man, hit the fucking priest! That's good, because that gets me up and I can heal you. Six plus two. Eight! It's all going to shit! Thank you! I stand up. I'll reach out and cast Cure Wounds on Nott. Yes, it is. Sorry. Eight points to heal. Then I guess we should start running, yes? I use the remainder of my-- Can I use my bonus action to dash? My bonus action to whimper a little bit. I'm hoping the priest is lame. Oh, that's just mean! Hideous Laughter. Does that mean we all get advantage on hits now? But you guys! We've got a whole other round! For at least a whole round. And each time he takes damage? Oh, I thought it was like a paralyzation sort of thing. Laugh it up, Fuzzball! What?! What's this mean?! What? That's right! Nine plus five? With advantage? Why with advantage? You got healing in there? You could do a cantrip as an action. Because you got enough distance. Yeah. 1d8 radiant. Don't touch it! I wonder if that makes spells better. (gasps) Yay! Find all the shit! This is so exciting! I'm going to walk up and pet the manticore's mantle. What was that? We should get out of here. Should we get out of here, I guess. Anything else in the chamber? Does it look like there's any other little, interesting things in there? Yeah. Well I'm still here with this big, giant manticore head so-- you guys got Caleb? I think it might be easier to put it on the cart. I mean, if it's all slow then it doesn't matter I can walk alongside it and pull the manticore head. We should probably just get there. The saviors of Alfield have returned! It's a manticore head. Oh fuck. We're still a-- I pull out the jar of ears. (laughter) They heard it. He's the coolest You're so epic. Do you have a present? It's so pretty. It was up Will's butt. I can't believe we survived. Nott the Brave.
