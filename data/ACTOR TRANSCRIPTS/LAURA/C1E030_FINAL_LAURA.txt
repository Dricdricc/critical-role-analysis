What was the code again? They have all kinds of wood. It's really freaking cool. Yeah, you are, actually. Do we all get to see what we're dressed as? Get out of here, Dread. This is Rat Queens. I'm Hannah. You should check it out. It's an awesome comic book. Huh? Oh, I'm conjuring up a little fuck you. It's pretty great. Oh my god, I'm so sweaty. But we skipped over my brother. We're all going to die when we're goofy looking. [dramatic music] It's actually really difficult to play a character when you're dressed as a different character, not going to lie. We're going to learn how to do it. So we are-- wait, I forget. We're in the tavern. It's nighttime now? Are we really going to talk about names right now and not about the giant creepy smoke monster that came out of you, Percy? I don't think it's safe to leave tonight. It might be smart to be down in the cellar tonight, not up. Okay. Burt, your mustache is falling off. Yeah, do that. And he doesn't even smile at all. You didn't seem to mind it as it was happening. (flatly) Oh, that's all. Who is the last bullet for? We don't want to lose you, Percy. No, we won't do that. Damn it, where is Pike?! She would know about this. Can we do any kind of religion check to see if we know anything about this kind of entity? 17. I think that's the best plan we have, actually. You did look pretty amazing, I'm not going to lie. But I don't like how dark it went, Percy. It went really dark. That guy deserved it, but we did rip his tongue out, which I think was a bit harsh. This is beheading a pony all over again. We're not going to kill civilians! They'll probably be pretty happy that the people that have been hurting them are being punished. Done. No, he's saying that if he goes dark, if he goes against his person that we know-- We're not going to do that. We're going to knock him the fuck out! Don't worry, Percy. We've got you. I walk up and I kiss him on the cheek. and I say Don't you worry, we've got you. I don't believe you're really sick, darling. Lovely. Thank you, Scanlan. We have a map of the city, yes? I think it best to stay off the streets. Is it possible, Keyleth, to tunnel through the city, underneath it? No, but they know we're here. It's not safe. We can come up in secret, leave symbols to rally the people, and hide again. Are we going there now? Are we resting? Can I sense anything near us? Can I sense vampires above us? Undead. Does it feel like there's more in motion than there were before we set off the blaze? Okay. That's why we stay under the city. That's what I said. All right. Nothing like a bubble of protection or anything? But they're undead. Lovely. Well, first watch. Who's taking it? I still think we should keep watch. I hate that he's asking for clarification. Don't 'what?' me. Well, you can light your little flaming warhammer. I'm pretty sure he just said bagel. What, what do you want? Can we see if it's magic? Oh good, I rolled a one. Shit. It's a teeny tiny tunnel. The source of the bad? It's possible it is. What if the Briarwoods are right under the Sun Tree, and we're right above them? You look really good, Matt. Oh, 22. 22. Are they vampires? They can. They're fucking vampires. Don't forget that we all have our amazing metal around our neck that Scanlan got us. Hey! Oh no, we haven't had another feast yet. I'm going to say Wake the fuck up! And I am going to-- can I hide? Is that what I do as my bonus? Even if it's super-duper dark? That makes perfect sense. I'm going to Hunter's Mark the one that looks the strongest. I am now going to attack him with my blazing bow. All right. Natural 20! That's right. I add all of my dice together and then I double it, and then I add the modifier? Okay. And I Hunter's Marked him, yeah. 31. That's 31 damage. The second one was a three. It was a 14 to hit. Wow, really? Can I aid him by shooting him at the same time as he is trying to break the grapple? It's been a lot of ones today, man. Is your little butt flap down? Are you in the long johns? I'll do my second arrow and try to hit him again because I don't like that I missed. I know, right? Don't suck so hard, me. That's better. That definitely hits. It was an 18 plus-- I said it was the one against Percy, even though the other one is Hunter's Marked. Well, I'm just saying. Yes! 16. Burt Reynolds should play with us more often. Are you really? Yeah, he did. We should probably use sunlight on them always, because don't they turn into mist if we don't kill them? I don't know, should we attack him or should we let-- Oh yeah. I bust out one of the wooden daggers. I walk up and I try to stab it into his heart. In front of my brother. Okay, I still get two attacks, right? 19? Okay, then what do I do? Probably no. 14. Nine? Wooden stakes don't work! I back up a little bit. I guess so. Can I move away, since he's grappled? I'm going to stay right there. Thanks, Trinket. Sunlight and water. Should we ask it questions or something? Okay. Good job, Scanlan! Future reference, the fog is bad. Not totally natural. Seriously, though, put your dick away. We probably gave away our location. We should probably get the fuck out. Really? Yay. Hey, that's what I rolled when I was trying to check things out. Yes. We find another place. Let's tunnel. I don't want to go up. No, we can't tunnel It's night. We can't travel at night. There's vampires. I feel like we're safer down here. At least there's only so many places they can attack from. That worked out really well because we probably wouldn't have defeated K'Varn without him. We're stupid. What if we went up above ground and went into the second floor? So we're not underground. All right, let's do it. It's fine, whatever. We're very packed in. It's nice and cozy and warm. I stay awake because I don't want them to be alone. Sigil. I need to sleep. You need to sleep. Trinket stays awake with you, though. 17. Oh, not Percy! Oh no, how many can you get before you're totally evil? Plus, there's probably dried food in this cellar. Is he the only one that was affected this time, again? Grog, give everybody a little bit of the Dust of Tracelessness. Yes. Yeah, we're looking for a new hideout. Check in every 30 minutes. It's dangerous. Meet back here in two hours-- Hold on. Meet back here in two hours if we haven't heard from everything. I was thinking Dorito, too! How weird. Yeah, I like it. No, have you? You got it. And Vex has advantage? Oh, right. Yes. This is the dumbest idea, by the way. Keyleth, you and me. All right. And Trinket. And I'm sure he told everybody what we looked like. We can't look like the same Seeming that we were before. Yeah, but he can write it down. Seeming. We didn't. I have crazy eyes. They're like (growls). I cast Pass Without a Trace on them before they leave. On all of us. Oh, there is? I really should read about spells more. Oh, within 30 feet of me. Speak up, girl! I can't hear you. MATT "I'm sorry, miss! I'm sorry. I'm Jordana Whisk. I'm Simon's daughter." I'm trying to look straight at her, but I'm really looking that direction and over there. (whispering) Lean in, girl. Lean in. Dear, the Briarwoods aren't after us. They're after everybody. What we need is a place to stay that we know is protected. (growls) Eight is-- 16. 80 60. Do you miss the de Rolos, dear? Well, we may know a couple de Rolos. We may know some. No big deal. Only one person would know the entire name of Percival de Rolo. de Rolo III. Magneto de Rolo III. Two greater healing and then another regular? Is it safe at night? Can I insight check her and see if she seems to be truthful? I never know which one. It's too much pressure to choose. That was the wrong one. I chose poorly. 13. One's a child, though. You won't even notice him. How?! Is that even possible? Did you really puke, or did you fake puke? I want to watch people as they walk away and try to read their lips as they're walking away to see if everybody seems loyal to what he said, or if anybody seems a little-- Can we try to memorize their faces? Of everybody that was here? Yeah, that was Keeper. I wink at him. The what production? Are they supernatural? Are they undead? Against the Briarwoods? We heard about green fog here. Is that something? Do we know what killed the tree? Does she come out during the day? I don't think she's a vampire. What kind of distraction? I like it. The next attack will be on the Briarwoods. Like a giant sparkler. Can you clear out clouds? Then if you can do that, can you make these gray clouds go away? Well, sunlight would be nice as opposed to this misty fog. Can you poke a hole in them? Is there just one of us who can make a big stink in the decoy house? You could definitely make a big stink. How about this? I use one of my exploding arrows you gave me. Of what? Oh man, you know what? I forgot I-- okay, cool. Just don't. I have thoughts. Arrow? Of course. Because it's this fucking town. It's fucked. No offense. It won't be fucked soon. No, come with us, Keyleth! You won't die, Scanlan. Yeah. Oh, how about this? Maybe we can tell Scanlan to set off the thingy. I'll come running out as my old crazy lady, saying, (screams) the house is under attack! Toward the guards guarding this house. And then I'll just stand there as they react. I thought we did. Stealthy. Stealth. I cast Pass Without a Trace on him. Huh? I guess I stealth behind him. Oh no. Which one should I use? Add ten. 36. (whispers) I can perch and take him out with an arrow. Do you want to sneak-attack him? That might be smarter. Got it. Should we let Scanlan do his thing first and then we sneak attack him? Set it all in motion? And then we'll count to three and we'll attack. Yeah, you do. Tell us when. Got it. We're just going straight into the house? Yeah, we go in the window. Oh, but that's only Grog in the front now. I give him Trinket. Going in with you. He's going in the door. Oh my gosh! But he is wearing a little petticoat. We meant to announce that, yeah. It just released this week. Ashley fricking Johnson! Sorry not sorry.
