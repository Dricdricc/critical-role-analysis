What if none of us want to write a speech? Sweet. Sorry. I thought you said cutting-ass technology. You didn't know it was going to be there? That's exciting. Oh my god! It looks like beautiful curls. Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they rise from the flames for the battles ahead. Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead. (singing) Can you answer the call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll! [fire burning] I know. I did, too! Oh no! Whoa! TALIESIN and Aw, see? That should've been on your playlist. That's the door that I'm seeing right here? The greefy right there? Yeah. Didn't we have-- No. Did we? Was that a different time? Our seaweed stealths. Okay. This tastes like salisbury steak. It's really messy! What? Oh, the door. Inside? From the doorway? From where? Ew, look at it! Yes! You don't. Beau, Yasha, and Fjord. It went 19 and then went to one. I am. I bit my tongue. Oh god, oh jeez! Oh god! No! How did they get all the way up? Can they climb walls? They can swim?! What were we thinking?! But she's in claws. She's grappled in claws. Yeah. For my bonus action, I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon? I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon! Yeah. Up by these guys. Sweet! Right in between them, and it's going to attack the one that is close to the wall. What do I add? Anything? Why do I forget how to play? My wisdom? Spell attack! So 15. I did it already. That's okay, I'm going to cast Sacred Flame at it. Yeah. That's his dexterity save. Yay, it hits! Go fuck yourself, crab! Ah! Eight plus four, 12! Yeah. I'm going to actually step behind the rock. Although I like that Yasha is the rock. And then?! Yeah, the guy died. (singing) I am stuck on Beauregard, 'cause Beau is stuck on me. Are you going to do something, Cad? Cad, do something! Was that Yasha? Add four. No? Okay. Then I'm going to use my bonus action to bring my Spiritual Weapon down and attack the one that is next to Beau because it's stunned. It can move-- motherfucker. Can I get to it? Balls. What a stupid-- okay. I'm going to go up to the one that is... ugh. I'm going to-- (unsure sound) It's a tough decision here. Here's the thing. Are you, though? I'm going to go to the one that's attacking Caduceus. I'm going to get behind it. Up and over. Goddamn it. Forget it. I'm going to stay where I am, motherfuck. Fuck. I'm going to fucking use fucking stupid Toll the fucking Dead on the one at Yasha. It's a wisdom saving throw. Oh, I get it. 12 points of bong damage. These things are tough, yo. I thought that was going to kill the one with Yasha. No, I'm going to stay! These guys are really tough, and they're so spread out. Plus four. Golf claps! Beautiful! Your beautiful blood rainbow looks so glamorous. Branding? Somebody make that a t-shirt! Yeah, but you didn't-- Those dice are really pretty. I like how they're themed. What about Yasha? Oh, hi, Caduceus! I'm going to move my Spiritual Weapon down to try to hit the one next to Yasha. Oh sweet! Doesn't it balance out, though, because it would've been at disadvantage? 17. Okay. Eight plus four is 12 points! I'm going to use the Spiritual Weapon and try to shove it into its mouth over and over again, saying Eat it! It's good! Then for my action I'm going to say Oh, hi, Fjord, and I'm going to jump up and land on its back next to me. I'm going to cast Inflict Wounds at 2nd-level. Ooh! Okay. Right, it's a touch, so it's not a melee attack. Okay. 24. That's how many? How many do I roll? 4d10-- no, wait. 4d10. 14 points of crab damage. It feels like Frumpkin, only painful. Beau, Caleb, you guys look bloody. Yeah, looks like shit. Yeah, it's cleaning it. I think we should maybe rest a little bit. As long as nothing attacks us inside. He tried to do it! I'll help Beau! I like that, regardless of the character, Taliesin likes to charm plant life. Not the stuff in the middle. Maybe just lay on the silt. What? Oh, you mean that little Inflict Wounds that I did? Oh yeah, that lollipop's pretty freaking cool! Ooh! Can I have been outside looking at the (clicking) that we fought so I can look at him and see what's going on? Does its busted-up robe have pockets? Yeah, that was. What was it before I accidentally hit it? Okay. Oh, four! Hey! That's what he said. It's actually a hole in the middle. Hey, you know what, though? I bet that the seaweed is actually really happy because before it had those crab things, and claws and stuff constantly fucking with it. Now we're really nice, and it's calm and peaceful in here. With this seaweed specifically. Oh, he had a robe on. Not that I could see. It seemed like a pretty old robe that didn't have any pockets or anything. He did have really long, tendril-y hair, which was pretty cool! Did you want to bring the body inside or something so that whatever is out there won't see that we killed it? But Yasha's really strong. Okay. No, I'm okay right now. Thanks, Mom. This is the body; this is what I was talking about with the tendrils, with the hair and stuff. There's no pockets. I already looked and stuff. Ew. Ew, creepy! I'll hold its hair if you want to hold its feet. Wait, wait! What if it's a door or something? Why would we let somebody know that we're coming if it's a doorway? We could peek our head in down below. I think it's just seaweed, Fjord. Did you want to climb through it? I'll go touch it, just in case. Oh, it's nice! It's nice seaweed. Thank you, seaweed. Gross how? I follow. (stage whisper) This whole thing is a recessed sphere shape, Fjord! Will the key in the lock release the (clicking tongue)? There were three in the art, and there were three balls, and you got the two balls. He's holding two keys, basically. Could you ask your god? Could you ask him? Well, do it like I do to the Traveler-- Yeah. Hey, Traveler! Yeah, he totally just said, "What's up." Hey Traveler, have you heard anything about this weirdo Uk'otoa guy? SAM, TALIESIN, and He has heard about as much as we have. (laughter) It's brownish. I gave you some agate dice. Those little ones that I gave you, those were green agate. Oh look, coins! What is that armor? 11. (inaudible murmuring) How much money did we find? I'm going to keep going. I mean, as long as everybody is hanging around talking, I'm going to keep searching. Yeah, I haven't opened it. Don't worry. Yeah! Magic armor! What do you think killed him? Well, I did say, "What you think killed him?" I got a 16. Oh, true. I thought that maybe somebody sat on his hips, like he was having sex or something, but it was too much for him. Oh, Frumpkin, you mean? Maybe you can cast Haste on Fjord, and that way he can get away quickly if he needs to. What if the chamber closes and you're stuck down here, Fjord? Well, that's good. That's a common signal. I'm going to sit down really fast and say Hey, Traveler. I know that he's doing something for this other god guy, but we both know this other god is pretty stupid, so if you do me a favor and watch after Fjord, that would be really great, because he's done a lot of things that has really helped out with stuff for you and he's going to be pretty helpful in helping me get to you later this year. Anyway, I really like you and I really like him and I would like if you would help out, please. Thank you. Can I help you? Did you hear what I was saying? Oh shit, I thought I was whispering. Hold on, let me think. I'm listening. What? I really hope he does help you. Be safe, Fjord. (whispering) And also, don't turn evil, okay? But if you do, I'll still be your friend. I mean, it's okay. You know, some people are evil. It's okay. Just don't turn evil to me. Really, any of us would be nice, but-- Okay. (background music) That's if there's any left! SAM and He did it. We need to get out! Go, go, go! I'll push Nott in front of me. It's a natural one, so it doesn't matter. Oh gosh. Can I cast Control Water? Is everybody around us? Yeah, but we were just going through the door, so we're getting sucked back towards the-- I'm going to cast Control Water and try to change the direction of the water around all of us so that we can push away from the geyser and get farther away from it. Swim away! Yeah, Fjord, haven't you seen me Control Water before? Nott! We're not in the water anymore! Did you get any special stuff? Whoa, you can do it! Oh no. No! Try it. Do it, Travis. You going to do it? Well, remember what-- What's it look like? Oh no! I'm the boatswain? Oh yeah. Now a boatswain? Oh. It's like a minigame! Woah. You have magic; you could be flinging magic at them. Okay. 12. I tried to eat one. The jackfruit candy. What is it? MARISHA and Durian. It's a durian candy. They got magic. It's gone. My Control Water was just to get us out. So, we need to... I like it. We've only got three cannons on the starboard side, though, if we turn to port side-- A 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side-- We roll a 30 or lower, it's good? Holy moly! That was some serious stuff, man! Are you guys okay? (shouting) Are you guys okay? I throw a rope out to one of the survivors. Aw, Matt! Do you guys have magic? Are you going to attack us? Do any of you want a tattoo? Yeah. I mean, it's up to our captain. We'll keep them tied up. We have enough food. Caleb, will you make sure that none of them are magic users as they come up on board, okay? It's okay. We'll aim our fingers at them instead. Get up here! Why did you attack us? Oh, that wasn't very smart. (intensely) Don't you know how bad-ass the Balleater is? The Balleater. It's the name of our ship. The Balleater. We eat balls. Oh! Hey, man, it's like both of you are teeth people. Oh. Well all right. Did you have any treasure on there or anything? Well, they tried to attack us! Bad things happen when you get-- We could give them really nice tattoos. Aw, but one of them I wanted to give a tattoo to, come on! It's totally optional. If they want to eat! Don't worry, Levar. We're all friends here. Do you like tattoos? This is really nice! I've been working really hard on my skills. Where would you like yours? No, no. No, Captain. I have specific tattoos that I've been working on. I want everyone who comes in contact with the Balleater and Captain Tusktooth to walk away with his symbol. It's a smiley face with a couple tusks and some googly eyes above it. (laughter) Where would you like it? Think about this! Think about how cool this will be! Think about in 20 years, when Captain Tusktooth is the most dangerous guy you've ever heard of, and there's stories about him. You will be able to say I crossed paths with the crew of Captain Tusktooth and I lived. Oh, so you can show people and be like Hey, check me out. You know that hands are really hard because a lot of time, the ink, it spreads. Okay, I'm going to do it. Oh! Oh, a dexterity check. 18! Yeah, yeah, yeah. (jokingly) I don't know, maybe. Here's another one for you. There may be some surprises, maybe not! Why? Brokenbank? Can I send a message to my momma? Hey, Momma! We are heading back to Nicodranas. Is it safe, do you think, for us to get there? Because I know that stuff is happening, and I haven't heard from you in a while, probably because I haven't sent a message to-- My momma says everything's okay! We just got to be careful. Between us or each? No, no, no. Woo. I think everybody gets 2 platinum. We are in a completely different boat, at least. Ship. Ship? We can make ourselves look different than when we left. (singing) Looks like I'll be forging some more. (speaking) I can do that. Yeah. I remember how I did it, too. I think that's a good plan, Captain. Yeah, did you release it or what? Where? Wait, a coast with three cities? That's the Menagerie Coast. That's his mentor. I could still send a message to the Plank King and see if he answers. Did he talk to you? Do you think he can read your thoughts? I mean, if what he's telling you to do is go towards the coast, that is what you're doing, so maybe he still thinks you're on his side. Do you think the Wildmother can hear your thoughts? So if you think something dirty, she knows? What if you're thinking, "Oh, man, I really got to poop"? What if you're thinking, "Aww man, I think I smell a little bit today." "I've got a booger in "my nose." What if you think, "Oh, does my breath smell bad?" No, your breath smells fine, but-- Yeah, you smell pretty good. What did we get? What did we get? I didn't say you're stinky. Nott said you were stinky, Caleb. I think you smell like salt and fresh air. What is it? Oh, fun. Lucky rocks are nice. Does it flicker? Is it like a hue light? That's really bright. It's like a pet rock, but it brings you luck. You should give that to Fjord. I go over to Fjord and hug him around the waist and pick him up. I'm just kidding with you! Well, what else do you have? I don't want to claim that if there's better things. Will it turn into a tree in your pocket?! I'm in studded leather armor. Yeah, go for it. Plus you don't have a Disguise Self. Yeah, you should take it. You should take it. Let me see it. Whoa! Holy shit! Yeah, she should have it, because that will affect her attacks, right? Yes, yes, yes. I know what all these kind of ship documents look like! I already forged some, and also I'm around ships and stuff. You made me do this last time. You made me use intelligence, I think. I think, Caleb, you're very officious. Can he help me sound more intelligent than I am? Should I look at the mote, you guys? Should I look at the mote? Yeah. Okay, I'm going to look at the mote of possibility. Okay, so I'm rolling intelligence? At advantage, because Caleb's helping me. I'm going to reroll again with my mote. That's so much better than the two and the four that I rolled originally. 19, plus one is 20, plus proficiency is three, so 23. Plus, I think I'm proficient with forgery kit. Oh, I understand. Whose name should the ship be under? Should it be Tusktooth, or should it be somebody that's not a pirate-y name? Yeah, a new sort of name. Do they know any of your names in Nicodranas? I mean, it could be anybody. Caleb, you could look pretty officious. We would be giving the ship to Orly. Is Orly your first name or your last name? What's your last name, Orly? Skiffback. Right. I really want a tattoo from him at some point. We haven't done it. Well, we just need crushed gems in order to make them. So you could maybe crush some jewels? Orly! How hard is it to make a cool tattoo that's pretty? The shiny ones? Yeah. Yeah, like 2,200. We don't have that kind of jewels. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Thanks, Orly! I'm going to try to spend the time on the deck teaching Sprinkle how to fetch an item. Like, if I show Sprinkle a button and hide it somewhere, I want Sprinkle to be able to get the button and bring it back to me. 20. I'm going to be so sick of you mother--
