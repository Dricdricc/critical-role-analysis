It is! You do. Actually, Ashley, I think I got shirts for you. When is that, again? A teeny-tiny poop, just from Sam. Oh! Oh my goodness. I wish we had the box in front of us, but go look it up, it's got this box on the top, and then it separates on the bottom and you can put your dice in the bottom. Yeah. Check it out! Did you see it, Ashley? Yeah, we'll watch it on the break. I've been in rehearsal all day for this. Because we literally got an email about it as we were starting. Yeah. They're refugees, probably. We float down, we float down. Yeah. We can't, we're in mist form. (hissing) I think we should help them. Maybe we can -- Maybe we can send them back to Whitestone. I float down. Into the trees, outside of the camp. Around there. Near the rocks, so that we're in camouflage. No, it looks like a refugee camp, Grog. People that escaped from Westruun, potentially. Yeah. I mean, it's a large group of people, I'm assuming they came from a city of some sort. Maybe we should pop them back to Whitestone. I feel like it might be good, if we find out if they're hurting. That's where we're putting our survivors. Oh. We could rest overnight, and you could pop them in in the morning? Are you out of all your-- oh, mist form. Maybe we'd find Pike's grandfather. Percy, would Whitestone be able to sustain this many more people? All right. You can't, like, leave them there. Oh. So noble, Scanlan. Oh, yes. Should we make sure they're actually innocent, nice people? Stealth ahead. Can I sneak ahead and just listen to them? Hey, like 100 yards out. I just want to hear what they're saying. It's pretty dark, though. But I do have good darkvision. Yeah. We're in the woods, right? Just kidding, we're in the grasslands. 18. There's no-- (laughter) Do we see anyone that we recognize from Westruun? No. Well, the guards are coming through with torches, I don't want them to find us and think we're spies. Yeah, but I don't want them to think that. Yeah. I think you can stay 'cause you're more hidden than I am. I'm going to go back to the group. I feel like they're going to see me. "I'm so hidden." Shit. All right, all right, all right. Just a second. Oh all right. Okay, fine fine fine fine. 23. Holy-- (whispers) That's Drez Vina! Well, should we go back to the group or tell them to come on in? We have earrings. (whispering) Hey, you guys. You guys! Hey Percy, pay attention. Hey, guess who I'm looking at right now? Well-- Drez fucking Vina Drez Vina was that dude that sent us on our very first mission together, you guys. Yeah, Percy you weren't there yet. Percy, you weren't there-- Drez Vina's the guy. Drez Vina was the asshole. Hey, keep it down. I don't know who all can hear over these earrings! See? He likes us now! We totally helped him. Well, maybe not anymore. The one you just mentioned. Do you guys want to just come on in? Make a nice, pleasant chattering-- maybe you should sing, Scanlan, as you approach so that people know we're nice What is it? What is it? Hey, you guys! Grog-- Don't you remember us? In Westruun? Vox Machina? Oh. While that was happening, I pulled aside his mother. Is this everyone that made it out of Westruun? But you're searching for a home? Cornelius. Is he the man I saw in the finer robes? Did he work in the Cobalt Reserve? Oh, okay. Oh, wonderful. We're meeting Cornelius. He's a bookbinder. Vex'ahlia. It's quite dangerous there right now. A small, older gnome? There's a city. A lot of the refugees from other cities that have been destroyed by the dragons are finding their way there and-- We could give you safe passage. Very quick, safe passage. There's farmland, there are some empty buildings. We have very safe means of travel. Oh. Possibly a bit deeper into the Frostweald. Really? Yes. Kill some orc. What does your brother look like? Understood. (laughs) A very safe one. Well, we've been to the Frostweald before. I'm not afraid to go in there again. Would there be any injured members of your camp that would want to head out in the morning to Whitestone? Somebody that needs any medical attention? Should we scour the camp for her grandfather? I know he said there were no gnomes, but-- Yeah. Right. I just, I don't know. I wish Pike were here. That's wonderful, and she can pop over. They could go in the morning and just go find her immediately. All right. What the fuck are you singing? What was that? Wow. Let's go find the injured. Yes. Can we find any families with children and maybe see if there's able bodies in there that we could send through? Yes. Maybe Elowen could go? How many sick people are there? Perfect. I talk to Elowen and ask if she can go find Pike in the morning, if she wants to go through, and all that kind of stuff. It's really fun, actually. You'll pop right out in Whitestone. It's amazing. I pop Trinket out and I sleep on him. Hugs and hugs. Yes. Yeah. He farts on you all the time. Ey-oh! What would you have seen? What would you have seen? We've got to walk them to the forest. Okay, we can walk for two hours. You know what, I'm going to fly up. I'm going to (hacking spit) and fly up and find a fucking tree. I'm going to scout for a tree. I didn't think about it. I forgot. 23. Fly back down and I tell them. I look along the path, though, and make sure it's safe, the walking back. Is it okay? I wear turquoise to blend in with the blue surroundings. I do some circles around and wave. I hang off of it as I come down, like woo! And then come back up. Dexterity or acrobatics? Damn it. I said as I come down. It was low. I was low. I grab for it! And (hacking spit) as I'm grabbing for it. Okay, okay. 25. I'll bet you thought I was really falling! I'm going to work on that trick, you guys, and it's going to be amazing. We remember, dear. Insight check. He's lying. 18. Very few things are beyond his understanding. Like golems. What does the circlet do? Scanlan, what the fuck? They're all sorts of different places. We're trying to figure that out right now. We're not exactly sure. We're not exactly sure, Keyleth. Because what if he goes to find them? Is it morning yet? Can Pike come join us yet? Tell you what, Master Quall. We're not heading there now, but we'll be going back, and when we do, we will find your home, and we will search out this circlet. As well as something from your collection. No, we would want something as well, physically. Do you know where they wander? I give Pike a hug as we walk to his tent. That's pretty cool. No no no. Lending is-- I am recovering a bit right now, but thank you for the wonderful, wonderful idea, Scanlan! Thank you! I appreciate the vote of confidence. We head into the Frostweald, we find the orcs and send them back and keep going and find this Sphinx-y mate. We just know Frostweald. Pike? Of the what mountain? Yes. You're stronger than Grog now! Oh, shit! Pike is so strong! Holy moley! But we can't use it, because she already used the travel through the trees. But we saved all those people, Scanlan. Let's walk. It is going to get cold, though, once we head into the Frostweald. We had all those fancy cloaks. I had winter's cloaks for all of us before. Does everyone still have their winter's cloaks from a long time ago? They're refugees. That's really sad. I constantly keep an eye out for anything in the front of us and behind us. Oh, that's good. That'll definitely not let anyone know magical people are on their way. But put it on Twitter so that everybody else knows what it is. We should probably rest, then, right? We'll be hitting the Frostweald at night tomorrow. Not anymore. The dragons are bunkered down, I believe. And I still have a little dried blood on the outside of my ear. I could use a bit of rest. You're really blurry, Percy, I have no idea. I want to pull my brother aside when we set up camp. Pike hasn't seen your beautiful mansion! Oh, that's right-- We can do it both nights? Scanlan has a mansion, Pike! I'm having a lot of talk with the servants about different ways to prepare food. Can I find-- Is there a library in the mansion, Scanlan? Can I pull my brother into a library or something? I just want to talk to you. Okay, weirdo. I couldn't help but notice, anywhere Pike was, you were not, all day today, and I have a feeling it's because-- Yes. I do. Don't walk away from me, please. I have a feeling it's because of this Raven Queen situation. I don't know. I know that you offered yourself to her to save me, and I can't put into words how much that means to me. I'm worried that she took you up on the offer, and I know you're worried about it, too. And I'm afraid that's why you're avoiding Pike. You're afraid she's going to see something in you. But I wanted to tell you, I've been looking through this book. It's the best 35 gold I've ever spent. Maybe it was 30 gold, I don't even remember anymore. It was 30! It would have been worth 35 for all the things that I found in it! Look, it's got all this information about the Raven Queen, and I've been looking at it all the time. I don't think she's as horrible as you're afraid she is. Can I tell you what I found? It says that those that follow her must hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life. That's not bad. Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. As the instrument of the Raven Queen, you must punish hubris where you find it. Bring down those who try to cast off the chains of fate. The Raven Queen represents death, right? Therefore she hates those that live an immortal life. She hates vampires! We hate vampires! They're terrible people, right? That's not bad! Watch for the cult of Orcus, and stamp them out whenever they arise. Orcus is bad. If she hates him, then she must not be that terrible. Oh. And? Well, that's understandable. Well. We've lived half our life in the shadows. You've made them your home. Am I right? This is a time you can either let those shadows swallow you down and keep falling into a hole, or you can use them to your advantage. You can become a champion. It's pretty fucking badass, if you ask me. I can smell it, actually. Pretty terrible. Maybe we can get you some oils or something to put on it. What I'm saying is, brother, I'm proud of you, and I'm happy for you, and I'm so, so thankful for you. And you don't need to be frightened! This is a wonderful thing. Not many fucking people can say they're a champion of a fucking god. All right. But as someone who's seen the other side and has come back thanks to you, there's no use living your life in fear. I love my reckless brother, as much as he hurts my heart. I love you for that, and don't be afraid to be that. That's wonderful. I love you. And I walk away! (laughter) The Room of Requirement? Shit! I'm not even on my-- (grunt) Oh, that's good. 30? Oh, wait, 28, 28. I need to practice with this broom. Yeah, we have stuff to do. All right, fine, I'll fucking practice. Does it help me at all to practice on this broom? I start flying. I clench really hard with my thighs to try to hold on to this broom. Oh, Jesus. Okay. One! Okay, that's not that bad. Damage? Oh, it's automatic hit? Okay. Oh, no. That's 17. Shit! Scanlan, Scanlan, I'm so sorry! I land, I land. I land and I instantly cast Cure Wounds on him. Fuck, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Pike! Pike, help, help, help, help! Oh, God, okay. Oh, good, that's good. It's just 1d8, do I add anything? 11. I hold my hand there. Pike, can you help? Sorry, Scanlan. You can blame my brother. I'm going to practice a bit more, you guys. Oh, come on. 16. Sorry about that, Scanlan. We should probably get a start on a walk. Yeah, yeah, save it. We might come across some orcs. I know, right? I could use some. Maybe you could think of the location of her mate, the sphinx's mate. Well, is it specific? It's just we can see them. Bet you're glad you have that beard now, huh? Keeps you warm? No? 25. Are we in the woods? 29. Can we see anything around it? Any people, any trace of tracks in the snow? There's a, look. There's a fucking obelisk. It's a tall stone thing, Grog. (clanging) Pike! I'm going to hide behind a tree and watch. I'm just going to keep guard! Getting a little closer, but keeping. You need to not use that dice right now. We fought basilisks in the Frostweald before. Can I hop on the broom and fly up and see if I could spot some basilisks around? Do I see any? 26. Don't look at them! 22. Pike? She likes to get the lay of the land before she attacks. We can't look at them, right? We remember that from before? Can we-- we can look at them to shoot at them and look away? Just don't look at them at all? Ah, that's so annoying! I can't tell how everybody's clumped. They're-- just basically they're all amongst all of our friends. Okay. Can I fly down and land on a tall tree? Try to brace myself? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I avert my gaze-ish, I look off to the side of one, but I can see it in my peripheral, is that how it goes, or it's like--? I Hunter's Mark one. Is that Scanlan? That it's next to? I do the one next to Scanlan-- That was my eye. That's just a flashlight. Oh, that's how I do it, okay. I'm going to-- That's right. And I'm going to shoot it! Through the Blazing Bowstring. Oh, I don't get regular because it's my favored terrain, so I cancel it all out? Okay. I'm at disadvantage. 18. Yeah. Plus the Blazing Bowstring, plus an additional d10. 17. 17. Yes. 15 on the second. Yes I did. Yeah. Yeah! On all of them? (singing) There can only be one gnome. That was fast. (gasp) Basilisk blood! We need to take the basilisk blood! Remember, that's super good... Ooh, nice! It's a bad luck night for Grog rolling! It's okay, from here on out, you're fine. You should be a scorpion all the time! Do it, Pike! Awesome. So it's the glowing one, I get advantage on the attack, because it's glowing? I'm going to Hunter's Mark it. I'm going to avert my gaze, and roll a regular attack then? Since it's advantage? That's 31. 15 plus Hunter's Mark-- Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark it. MATT and Okay! What did I say, 15? 18. And then do I still get regular attacks? This is at disadvantage. 19? 18. I roar from up in the tree! No, I hold the broom in my hand! Defying Gravity style. I'm not flying, I'm in a tree, dude. Oh no! Was that all of them? Okay. Oh, I roll with advantage, because I'm in the forest! Oh my god, I rolled a one twice in a fucking row. I see nothing. Oh no. What does it say? Didn't Osysa say something about, her mate wouldn't say its name? And this is a symbol of Ioun. Say knowledge in Elvish. A name is earned. Do you double those ones though, because it's the dice? Ow! Nothing. No, I just hit my tooth. MARISHA and We can get some and put it in my bag. It keeps things good. It's all you, Grog. 25. I drop a pin in that, and I tell Keyleth, now you can use that thing! No, I mean your spell, Keyleth. Fastest way to get to this point! I thought you already learned it. No, he said just don't use that thing! It's okay, it's okay. I can see it. Just use the spell and pretend that you never unlearned it. That I pointed out to her. See, there we go. We got some! Sure. I go look at it. Investigation? 19. No, why would you do that, Matthew? That's terrible! We could heal him! Towards the beacon! Can you regrow his little arm like you regrew my brother's little nubbin of a toe? Oh, we're terrible. Basilisks? Big lizard creatures? Was it just the three of you, then? Not a large group of people? Can we-- Oh, no. I feel terrible. That's good, that's good. Well... It's like a two-day walk. Well, you're more than-- Actually-- He's rather smart, isn't he? Here's the thing. It's very dangerous, dear, and it's quite possible you might be turned into stone again. No, we don't want that for you, either. Straight-up killed. Beheaded. All options. But you're more than welcome to join us, for a short amount of time. Or you can head back to a camp that's about a day and a half away. I feel like we should help him or something. That would be good! You've been to the base of the Stormcrest Mountains! Actually, did you see something similar to this obelisk at the base of the mountain? Yes, well, we're sorry about the arm, dear. Why don't you want to go that way? Have you seen orcs in this wood? Ooh. Actually, we should probably take care of the orcs. Yes, we did. What do you say, Grog? Would you like to kill some orc? Would you like to stay here while we fight the orcs, or could you walk us towards them and stay hidden? Then you come with us, and then you stay very, very hidden. That was a lot of sidetracks on this particular adventure. Oh, man, she's creepy! Creepy as fuck! 19 strength, say what! Yes, please! Next week is our 49th, two weeks from now is our 50th. May be a couple surprises in store.
