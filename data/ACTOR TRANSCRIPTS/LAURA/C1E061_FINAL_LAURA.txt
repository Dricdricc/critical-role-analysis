Because you're special. Saturday. It is exclusive to GenCon, the same way we did our exclusive for New York Comic-Con poster last year. Oh yeah, I just love them so much. It smells really good. That's long. It should be in the chat room. It's beautiful. Travis and I are seeing Hamilton this weekend. What? Yeah, we really do. He's written some fanfiction about it. You just wait. Yeah, I did. Yeah, I did. What I'm really excited about is that card was at the live show, and it is not in my stuff right now, but I did. No! I do, however, still have my title. Everything's under control. We're alive. No, yeah, Trinket tried to kill me, but don't worry, everything's fine. Me too! Keyleth, can you open up the trees so our friends can get in? Aren't we blocked off? I was busy looking for my card. And I found it. Hi guys, my name is Vex'ahlia. Cool, yes, we're good. Can I search for that tea set that I tried to give him? Cool. Balls. Off to a good start. Ten. Yeah, cool, it was a golden cursed tea set. There was a big fucking bear. You might actually not want to look in that cave, because it came out of there and it was rather angry when it did. A guardian spirit of the forest. Yeah, would we have heard anything about this in our studies? What's in the cave, Keyleth? There was a spirit bear in there. It was a big fucking bear, yeah. Trinket popped out and he saved us. Trinket fucking saved us, Scanlan! What about Garmelie. Would he know? Hey, Garmelie. What do you know about this fucking bear? Yeah, I'll insight check that little bastard. 18. I feel like he would've told us to avoid it. Maybe we should save our strength for the fucking bow in the tree. I really don't think we should mess with this thing. How much gold do you have? That's it? You didn't fight them at all? 23. That's disgusting. So there was really nothing there? What did you really find in there? Yeah? That sounds terrible. I wish Pike was here; she would really enjoy this story. I like how all of us sound like we've lost our voice. You want me to lick it? Like healing? Like you want me to use a whole spell on this teensy-ass wuss cut? I cast Cure Wounds on his little teeny-weeny cut. I think we should remember this place is-- well, it's probably going to disappear after we walk away. These things tend to move, don't they? We need to focus on the bow. And it's really hard to say that, but I really-- So stay on it. Oh, we rested? So I can take off this negative seven hit points that I don't even remember how I got, probably. You're right. You guide. In the front. How were you planning to guide us through it if you don't even know how to do it? How about you and I, we can be in the front. Duchess of the Grape Hunt, what a wonderful title. The only thing I worry about is we made a deal with him. He shook our hand. Right? It looks very good on him. Hold my hand, dear? 17. Eyes out for any things. You can always ride on Trinket, too, Scanlan. I'm going to try to learn from him how he's gauging his surroundings and stuff. 21. What does the licking do? You're bullshitting. So much faith in you. Definitely the theater. Natural 20. And I don't even need to roll again. What do they do? Do they just scream a lot? Oh no. 12. Oh, double-double! That's better! 25. (whispering) What is that? The music, do you hear it? What does it sound like? Does it sound pleasant? There must be people further in. Yes. Do you know anything about music playing randomly in the woods? What direction is it coming from? It could also be a camp. (whispered) Ugh. I want to see what it is that's doing it, though. We have to do it regardless, yes. For a hot second? Garmelie? Do you want to come with us? Go invisible? I will hold your hand, don't worry dear. Oh, can I cast Pass Without a Trace on us? I'm going to do that. Whoa. 28. Did she? I don't remember. I just wanted to see, but if you're worried about it, we don't have to. Oh. Get on up here, you stealthy fuck. Add ten to it because of Pass Without a Trace. I cast it on everybody that's within 30 feet of me. Would have been eight?! Jesus. Aw, fuck. Okay. All right. I basically just want to see what the fuck is laughing. I want to see what it is. What kind of figures? Fuck! Fuck this. Fuck it. I'm not doing it. No. Don't fucking go closer. I get a really bad feeling. All of a sudden, I get a really bad feeling about this. I'm behind a tree. They're totally charmed. Oh, jeez! Is it a charm effect? I take my broom out and I start flying up and I grab Scanlan's hand and take him on the broom with me. We're going to fucking get Vax out of there. 23. No! Don't jump off the broom! I'm going to try to Pokéball Vax into my necklace. Okay, I'm going to try to do that. Not yet! You have to make a wisdom saving throw against me. Why'd you roll twice? It's not charm! It was just wisdom. Then he goes in the Pokéball! Sorry, necklace. The Raven's Slumber necklace. Can I grab Scanlan? I want to fly down and get him around the waist and pull him out. Athletics? Oh, that's strength, isn't it? Oh, sorry. 17. Fuck. I'm so weak, you guys. Just a regular strength check? It's not a saving throw? 11. I fly away. Minor problem. It was really a very bad idea to go towards the music. However, Scanlan's enchanted, and we should probably save him because it looks like a lot of people have also been enchanted and are stuck there forever. If you're going to come and try to save him, plug your fucking ears, because I have a feeling this music is cursed. And I start shoving shit in my ears. Well, then fucking get in there and help him. Maybe be an elemental and shove some shit in your ears. I'm going to let him out of the Pokéball before we get him out! I'm afraid because of the music's still playing. What if you're still charmed? I'm not going to dump him out. What did what look like? It was a camp with bones all over the ground and floating music things. Dancing. There weren't tents? Just bones. Yes? Was there a fire pit? There was a single fire pit. There was a floating violin and a floating set of drums. No! Don't! They actually looked really distraught. I think they were under a spell, as well. I'm going to nock an arrow. And point it towards the violin and hold it there. But you have stuff in your ears. Please roll good. I feel like we should aim for the instruments. Are they? What did you aim at? Can I aim at one of the other ones? Yeah, since he shot, I want to shoot. What else was there? Drums. I rolled 16. 15. What the what?! No, it happened when I was saving him against the Briarwoods. Two natural 20s. Maybe it's time for Grog to go in. Round two, Grog runs in and grabs Scanlan, and we run out. He can't be charmed! I feel like we should let Grog go. Good, it stopped. We can go back out. Okay, so you're all right, Scanlan? I release my brother. He's out of Raven's Slumber. It was the worst play I've ever seen. Garmelie! Why didn't you warn us that could happen? We trust you, dear. We should not go back out there. Best to avoid them. Let's avoid it. We move towards the dusk. 25. It gave us advantage-- No, I did, yeah. Oh. It didn't help. I was trying to. 36. I think they're here. We hope to rid the land of a cancerous tree that has been a blight for a very long time. He's not. Many diseases. Something else? It's our computer? We should probably kill it. I feel bad for everybody listening. Maybe just make it come out of your iPad. That's how we did it at home, man! What's Trinket doing? Oh. Ukurat. Isn't that the big ghost bear? Name it. They sound really powerful, these pixies. No, we have a very good chance of defeating them. We are quite powerful. Just wondering why you haven't done it before. Cool. Hey, question. Should we help you with this terrible problem you've been facing, do you think there's any way you would want to help us when we try to take out this cancerous tree? It needs to be taken care of. Teamwork? It's really bad. Whole other area for you to dominate. It's quite wonderful. Goddamn it! Wait, it's my favored terrain. Natural one. That is very agreeable. Be nice to him, Trinket! All things considered. Right, Garmelie? Scanlan is really charming. No, but I'd like to try. Honestly, they didn't seem that bad. I feel terrible killing them for no reason. Follow the lights. Would you want to draw some of the pixies if we see them? You can hide behind Grog, and you draw the pixies. They're really that small? Are they super strong? Maybe the pixies can help us take out the cancerous tree and all the things around it. I'm in a forest. That's better. 22. How many hours do you have left of reading? Garmelie, won't they see you? You should probably just hold onto Grog. If he runs in, just trail behind him. They're teeny, though? It's teeny little houses? Definitely pixie city is up ahead. Yes, I look for that. Good idea, Grog! Good thinking. Me, too. That's not still active anymore? 27. And we can't spot any pixies near us at all? That would take out the lot of them? It seems so drastic. He's Vex, I'm Vax. That's double because of favored terrain. What is that, 20? No, 33. Can you shapeshift into a pixie? I like this. Do we need to let the pixies know that we're going to do this? I'm just worried that if you do it then the lycans are going to bust it, and then they just go to battle amongst themselves. This is actually really smart. You've got the mansion. What if you do the Hallucinatory Terrain, and we just leave? How do you know? We cast it and we create a ruckus-- Do Hallucinatory Terrain. Garmelie, which direction should we run if we're running towards where we're supposed to be going? All right. We take off running-- Towards the bog. You do it, we act like we did something, we start running. Towards the Shademirk. But keep on the lookout for mandrakes. No! 31. I'm looking towards where we're going. I've got land stride, so I don't get slowed by any hard terrain. Are we going the right direction, Garmelie? What is it? Seriously. A wall? Hi. Oh shit. Fucking destroyed. We destroyed their home, and then we took off running. That's what you wanted, right? Apparently, our methods were not complete. We will go back and we will do it better this next time. Wait, you're locked in here because of the pixies? A little communication is all we need! I feel like we need to rest, you guys. We really need to rest. Garmelie, who do you know that's left these woods? Your uncle Jameson, and he was definitely telling the truth that he went in the woods? So he knew about the happy camp. I guess I fly up. Can I fly up and see how high up it goes? It's a bubble. We're in a bubble. I go back down. Yes, Grog? I feel like they weren't that bad of guys. They could've attacked us, and they didn't. They just want out. Scanlan, can you sleep? Read your book. We'll sleep. I'll stay up, as well. We'll take a short rest into a long rest. So he can finish reading and then we can sleep. And I'm up with him. I'm awake. I'm keeping guard. That's totally tiger-like. Gross. That's foul, Keyleth. If she gets petrified while she's pissing, it's going to be-- Keyleth? Keyleth, dear? Shit. Shit. I go and I kick Vax awake. Oi. Your girlfriend's not back yet. She went off prowling as Minxie and she's not home. Fucking A. That is not what I meant for you to do. Scanlan, you-- I don't know. Did you do your hair differently today? Good. You guys are back, everybody's safe, everything's good? If they don't find us. Can I use my ranger abilities and try to disguise where we're camping? I'm going to get a little sleep, though, so I can get my spells back. Anybody else taking watch? They might've heard you. What? So we fucking should get out of here? Wake everybody up! At least we can prepare ourselves. I wake Percival up. Percy. Hi, grumpy. We've been discovered by fairies. Get ready to use your charming wiles. I'm going to let Scanlan sleep a little bit more, because he looks fucking exhausted. All right, fine. Can we make things look fancy around here so when they all come back, we look like we're ready to talk to them? Whitey? Are you calling him Whitey as a nickname? What in the fuck is going on here? How is this happening? I'm going to sit up. Oh, you know what, I'm going to put out the little gold tea set, and I'm going to act like we're welcoming them to tea whenever they show up. I never did actually find out what this tea set does. Oh, you know what, and I take out my old wooden music box that I discovered. And I wind it up and make some pretty music. I like it, thank you. Don't drink out of the teacups, because I really think they might be cursed. Seriously, Percy, I know it's appealing to you, but don't get cursed again, all right? Oh, good. Oi, Scanlan. Sing a happy tune about how much we love fairies. Yeah, like how pretty they are. Sounds good, too. I wasn't quite rested, but it was lovely here. We've been trying to prepare for your coming. Unfortunately, we don't have very much to make it appropriate. I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding. You see, we were trying to pass through these woods, and we ran into a band of very big, very mean-looking wolves. Which, of course, we didn't want to do. His cut? A great mission. What are you going to-- Okay. Yes. They wanted us to hurt you. To destroy your circle of stones. Yes, we're on a very important mission, and we thought it might be the quickest way to complete. That's really, really off-putting. Understandable. But we weren't trying to deal with them. In fact, we made no deal with them. We told them we wouldn't make a deal until we spoke with you. But we were scared. We were too scared. How can we buy his freedom? Thanks, Wisher. Wouldn't you rather have a song? Wouldn't you rather have-- how often do you get a performance? Can you quickly-- Natural 20 on an initiative. I don't know what I can do to them. A Voltron? I feel like it would be easier to hit if it was a giant Voltron. Yeah, I know. Me, too. They're dicks. They were going to take Grog. Grog is on the ground? Oh, he is on the ground. Yeah, we should've, but we didn't, because we're idiots. 27, as well, with a natural 20. Those fairies are so spread out. I thought they would all be together. Probably. I'm going to move over to my left. Yeah. A little bit more. I want to line them up in a cone, so if I can get as many in a cone as I can. It's a 60-foot cone there that I have. It's a big cone. I want to cast Hunter's Mark on the shiny one that he hexed, as well. Double. They're weak, you guys! Milk jug rings, take them out. That gets the mamba jamba? Okay, good. That's what I want. Conjure Barrage. It's a 15 for me. So they take half. 3d8, halved. Oh. Sorry. 15, halved. Plus Hunter's Mark damage on the-- I got three on that. That's one action, isn't it? So I can't use Trinket yet, because I already did something. I want to duck behind that tree, like it's going to do anything. You can break. That's super bad. Trinket runs and stands next to Keyleth. Out of camera view. They're all super magic, super-duper magic. We're going to die. Why'd you do that? So you're not a kitty cat? Grog is stone. Of course he does. Oh no, and he took out a tree while he was at it! You go. Okay. If I step out from behind the tree, do I have a sight on the big one? Can I walk over there, then? Okay. I walk to there. I want to use my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel and attack it. Natural 20. 12 plus 12. 24. And then 22 on the third. 20 on the first hit, no-- oh shit. You double the dice? Six, that's 12. 26 plus another five, so 31 on the first hit. 17 on the second. 17 plus five is 22 on the third. Oh. So I shout out Two! Your leader's dead! You want to still fight us? I move towards the tree. That way. Wow, this is the longest-- I thought he was a honey badger. He's broken. It's stealing all of his energy! When you moved the paper, you rolled it. I'm sorry! No, he's restrained. It's a really powerful pixie fight. You get one, and you get one! And I'm going to fail. I got inspiration! 21! How many more pixies are there? Can you poison damage it? Come on! Do you have any more luck? How many fairies are left? I don't see them on the board from where I am. I can spot him now because I can see where Percy's shooting at, right? Where was it that he was shooting at? Can Trinket reach it? Then I'm going to attack it. Can I attack it from where I am? I'm going to try to get into sight. Okay. I'm going to attack it. 23? Then I'm going to attack it again with my blazing bowstring. 26. Can I move my Hunter's Mark over? Thanks, man! Okay, seven plus seven. 22 on the first hit. 24 on the second hit. Teeny tiny little piece of shit! I can't move anymore? You're looking good, Bigby. We shouldn't kill it! See if it can unfreeze our friends! Be confident! Oh no! Should you add it? Add it! We have some friends that are stone right now. Maybe you should do that. It's not so bad. Good job, Grog. Doesn't feel so good, does it? Hey, remember when I was made into stone? We're twinkies. We have to go finish what we started, though. They want us to still desecrate the stones. Did you draw a lot of the fight? I hope you did, because we kicked some ass there. Sweet. Nice. Very good. That tree just moved. Yes. You are a powerful ally. Is there anything around that looks good to take? 23. Yeah, I know. We did kill FernGully. They weren't trapping travelers of any kind, they were trapping the lycans. Yeah, but then they let us out. Let's sleep in the mansion tonight. But you can't? Yeah, let's sleep up in the trees tonight, before we make our way into this area. You realize it's only been an hour since we slept last, but it's all nighty. No, but Lord Big Badass is going to help us. He might try to. And you didn't get to do any of it! Hey, we're going to have werewolves everywhere now, guys. We just let it out. Thank you, Backblaze!
