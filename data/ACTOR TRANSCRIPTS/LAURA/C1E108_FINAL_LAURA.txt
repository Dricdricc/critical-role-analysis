He looks like he is in Miami. (hum "Axel F") Hi! We have something to show you guys. You just wait. Hey guys, why don't you roll that footage? Oh, these tarot cards? Hold on, let me open it up, since you didn't see enough of it in that amazing commercial. Liam, tell us about the artist. Go check them out. They're in the store right now. They're amazing. All of the other stuff that we had is still in the store, as well, including this fabulous necklace. And the posters shipped, so get ready to get them. Or maybe they're shipping tomorrow, something like that. I don't remember. But they're going out. And then the aprons are shipping at the end of next week, so you'll be getting those soon, too. You're amazing. I don't even understand that reference, bro. You were on the wall. I feel like I had been looking at the thing. The big empty pyramid triangle thing. I was on my broom, because I had been hovering looking at it. About there, then. Not so soon! (grumbling) 23. Oh god. I want to attack them. I'm going to attack the one next to Percy. Attack-style. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him and then I'm going to attack him. I'm going to do this, and then this, and then this. God dang it! That was a miss; it was a one. It was a natural one. Fuck! I do it again. Oh my god. 21. Okay, well that's good. Oh my god, I'm going to scream. Yeah, I know, bro. You're not bro, you're hubby. 14. Don't say other numbers! 14 plus seven is 21. 24. How high is the ceiling? Yeah, I'm going to fly up. All right. I'm going to go to the roof. Oh yeah. Some of that was lightning damage. That was two points of lightning damage. Because they're made of metal. I don't know if that did anything special. Oh wait, I get 3d6 of sneak attack now? An extra four. Only Hunter's Mark once on your attack. Just kidding. It's Hunter's Mark every time. Yeah, no, I know that. Yeah, sneak attack's only once but Hunter's Mark is every time. Don't give him ideas. Stop it. Wow. Do we still have our Death Ward on? Get him, Grog! 29 is not terrible. Did you know that? Maybe he doesn't see you because you're above him. I know! Oh no. It can jump that high?! 25? If I'm prone do I still get to roll to roll through the coals to avoid it or some shit? I think for you, you count the poop as a 20. I think poop is normally one. You got a one, as well? Okay. Which is what? Flames help it. Fire heals them. Cold damage. Do cold damage! 31 divided by two? Yeah. Do something amazing. They're technically both equidistant from you. Well, plus a 1d12. I'll figure it out. Can you hit the two that are by us? How much damage is it? Put me out, I wouldn't be on fire anymore. Do it! Unless they're magic. Maybe it'll push me out of the coals. Oh, do I roll a dexterity save, too? I think I fail it. Oh no. 16, fail. Yay! Did I get pushed out of the coals from the water? Is it up through, all the way to the ceiling? You know what? Seriously though, thanks Keyleth. Okay, so I'm going to stand up. I can see him good enough though to shoot him? Am I at disadvantage because he's prone, but he's right there? Okay well I'm going to back up, because he can't take a strike at me, right? I'm going to back towards the stairs where Scanlan is. Thanks, Scanlan! Does that Cutting Words him down to 19 or 18? Then he doesn't hit me. Great! I think I'm going to then try to attack him. Okay. Ugh, natural 20 was one of them. 30 is the first attack. Oh, so if I hadn't moved away I would have been okay? Yeah, so it's not cancelled out, if I hadn't moved it would have been, never mind. We'll just fucking say it's fine, because then I'm going to wish I had that crit I just got. So 30 was the attack roll. Okay. (groans) Okay, that is 13, 14, 15. 15 plus one lightning damage. Plus six sneak-- no sneak attack, just kidding. There's the Hunter's Mark. Five Hunter's Mark. That's the first attack, and the second attack at disadvantage is 19? Fuck. Yeah. Sorry, can I use my bonus to hide behind one of those pillars? 16. It's foggy in this room! 41! It's just another attack. Oh, you got to it! It's so good when they're within range of Grog. Can we get some paper towels? LIAM and It may have landed on some wires. Somebody's running now. Soon as we said wires. The worst. It's seriously under the box though, on the wires. It's everywhere! How is there so much coffee?! I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself. Good job, Grog. See if you can smelt some platinum into that thing, Grog. Should it be platinum? Should probably be platinum, yeah? You know how to do it, because you're a blacksmith now. No, it's already got a pyramid in it. Puzzle piece! Got to fit them together! With the jaggedy ends, or with the smooth ends? (shouting) Let's put it in the big thing! Yep. Let's go. We push it in harder. This is definitely going to be really good. 15. LAURA and Yeah. Grog, you try. Oh Jesus. There's a dent in it now. Hey, I've got an idea. What if we take this thing off of the cross beams, right? And stick it in the coals, or something. Because why are the coals here, right underneath it? I don't know. Oh yeah, good idea! But we should reignite these coals, because I think it's bad that they've burned down right now. Can we turn the circle? Does it move? Gosh darn it! What are we supposed to do? Maybe it's supposed to be gold. I think this needs to be gold, dear. Well, the outside is gold. We can try it. We have gold. Good call. We got to fucking try it in gold! Try it in gold. Maybe try it in gold. What is it? (gasps) What are the armors made out of? Can we melt the golems into their heads? Melt each one. Maybe it's got to be the metal they're made out of. Yeah, so take some of the metal and melt it down into the head. So maybe can we melt it? I feel like that makes it special. Melt their body into their face and make triangles out of the metal. You guys are so smart about this stuff, then we should do gold. Wait, how come it was 300? Oh, it's not the same worth, it's the coin. Let's put it in the key. No! I already said that I had them. No. No, he doesn't do that. Yeah, and I'm hiding behind the pillar that I'm next to. Oh my god, it's so good. St. Nicholas. A giant anvil? 17. That sound is creepy as fuck. Over the anvil? And the figure is 20 feet fall, you said? Oh no, again? Maybe he's a friendly giant really creepy-looking entity. Maybe he's the Allfather. Is that what he's called? In and out, super fast. Dart up to him and go (taunting) and then dart back. Just fly in really fast. Be creepy and quick. You've got fuzz on your face. Can I get it? No, you got it. It was right on his lip, so every time he talked-- It's got to be you, because you're so fast. If you get his attention you can dart out really fast. Should we try talking to him? Maybe it's better. You can speak Celestial, too, right? You don't just read it. I thought Celestial sounded more like singing. Tell him we were sent by Pelor. I'm floating behind him on a broom. Does it have to be single file with this? Okay, then I'm going to be back over to the side of Scanlan. The ground is still super duper hot, right? Tell him, nod yes. Once for yes and shake his head no. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself one more time, while this is happening. Maybe if you use it the right way, it will be fine. Yeah. Yeah. I take mine out of my pocket. Okay. In your vision of how to do it, did you see this guy? The hammer that he let go of. What if you go and try to pick up that hammer first? Do you need it? Is his sword as big as our table is across? Well, I pulled mine out. You've got this Scanlan! Come on! Well, it's not like you can step up to the anvil before the metal's hot anyway, right? So maybe we're stepping up to the anvil too soon. Maybe you have to heat the metal first? I wouldn't send him any closer to the anvil, though. It might send him in attack mode. Well, yeah, I'm going to fly up next to Grog, but I'm not going to go past him, and I'm going to hold up the little bead of power. I'm going to step one step forward with it, no further than Grog stepped that first time. All right, I back up. Fuck! I'm going to fly to the side against the wall. Yeah, that's what I was going to do, so I could shoot it around. Yeah, and I'm going to shoot an oracle arrow behind him to see what's going on over there. I wasn't even shooting at him! Tell us where to get it. 14. We are fucked! Make peace! (laughter) Obviously doesn't give a shit about me any more. I gave them back! Top of my turn, I'm going to fart. And you're on fire. He can walk! He can move! Maybe it's an illusion. Doesn't hit. Sup dice? He really wrote sup dice. Oh jeebies. Oh! I can use disengage! So he doesn't hit me! I'm going to move away from him. All the way across, over here. I don't remember because I don't have the thing anymore. I know, Matthew! I think it's 40. Probably. 50 feet. I'm writing it down right now, okay? I'm going to attack him. That dice attacked me while I rolled it. A 23. Oh lord. Okay. I thought because he was big, maybe. Is he covered head to toe in armor? Great. Okay, so I'm going to attack him again but in his neck. Oh, that's good. That probably hits. 18 plus 14. Okay, I didn't want to do the math. (counting) Do I get sneak attack? Wait, that's lightning. One extra lightning damage and then nine sneak attack. 17 plus nine is 27. Plus one lightning damage, so it's 27. But he says it in Swedish. TALIESIN and It's okay. That's great. Grog definitely won't fall in the lava on his turn. To keep him from wandering off. It shut him up for a little bit. No, can you uncanny dodge? Don't you have another thing? Oh no. Wait, don't you have to roll the constitution? Is it a visual spell? Guys, this is bad. We haven't actually done anything to him, have we? No, I got an arrow on him. It was a magical arrow. We can't even run away. He's going to kill all of us, dude. He can get all of us in a circle. Everybody. Doesn't hit. (gasps) Oh my god. Can you inspire yourself? Inspire yourself. Great. I'm going to disengage. I'm going to go over to Grog. I'm going to fly next to him and I'm going to touch him and I'm going to cast Lesser Restoration on him. Heals blindness and deafness. He needs to be able to fucking see so he can smith while we're trying to distract this fucker. Yeah, that's the thing, he was holding. Well. Okay. Do I have any more movement left? Do I have any more movement left? That's my last level two that I cast. Great, so I don't have any more Lesser Restorations. I can cast it at a higher level, maybe. I don't know why you would grab the hammer. I mean that's all I can do. That's my action, my bonus, and my movement. You should probably get out, right? I want to try to move Bigby's Hand to hold on to his arm. Can I try it? That's amazing! Hey, Scanlan, you should have done that before. That would have been really cool. You can't be blinded as a planetar, can you? There's no way to run away from him. We have to either defeat him or find a way to disengage him. His weapon is grappled right now, so I don't know if you'd have advantage on trying to disarm him. I feel like he's invulnerable. I'm just above you telling you how hot you look as you're doing it. Right after you were healed. Well, bonus action is Vow of Enmity. (singing) Bigby's Hand! It's the sword. It throws him off balance. His concentration, maybe? No, he said you were in range. He was in range right when you moved. Aw, he can even get Scanlan? But he's so little! Ooh, that hits. And the elemental. I'm going to uncanny dodge. Oh no! Ugh! I'm blind! Do I remember where he was? Can I shoot in his general vicinity, even though I'm blind? 21 won't hit him, right? Okay, so I'm going to try it again. Goddamn it. No, it's at disadvantage. Neither of them hit. Okay. Let's see if this is-- nope, it's an action because I'm a genius. I'm going to back up. I don't know if that'll do anything. I'm going to disengage and I'm going to back up on my broom. Great. I'm rolling so good tonight. Shush. 17. Oh, I'm on my broom, so I was flying backwards. As far back as I can without dying. Oh no! Why? What are you at? What is your-- You can't die. He can't die? That's a rule? Yeah! 12! Yay! It's okay. It's all right. I forgot Hunter's Mark for so many episodes. Does grit give you advantage? Oh, but you're still unconscious. Did he go under? Tell me you're not unconscious. I think I can get him out. Yeah. Okay. All right, can I get to Scanlan from my position on the map? All right, then I'm going to pick him up. Can I use my action to-- Can I use my bonus action to dash away? Okay, I'm going to back up. Into the corner. At least I got him out of the lava. But that's it? That's everything. Scanlan's dead. Unconscious. Kill it! Whoa. It was a trial. You had to be able to beat him in order to forge here. I'm putting Scanlan out! Because he's still on fire. Scanlan is not on fire anymore. He's still unconscious, so I'm going to cast Cure Wounds at level one, because that's what I can do, so I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on him to bring him back to life. So six points, Scanlan, that's what you've got. Yeah, you're low double digits, too! I hope he won't come back to life as soon as we start. Yeah, we should probably, if we can, take a short rest. Just so you guys can think about your process, know exactly what you're doing. 19. Scanlan? You got a lot of hit dice that you can roll. I'm back to 144. So these trammels need to be made out of platinum. You know how to do it, right? Okay. So what do we do? They're going to be melted. So we have to get into the other room first before we do any of that. Can I fly over and see if I can find any kind of apparatus that would-- 30. Okay. And I'm assuming that I'm not strong enough to pull on that chain, right? I can try. I'm going to try. Yeah, but you can't fly anymore. You fly on one and I'll try to get the other one. Oh, I rolled a 13. Can the guardian do it? Hey, you that was attacking us. Can you get those chains? (laughs) Really? Yeah, it wasn't a very persuasive thing to say. 14. It's too high. Or she could probably lift Grog up. You're very angry about it. Yeah. There's no inspiration-- Oh, no, he rested. Yeah. 300 platinum each. Oh. Would those little pyramids work to make the trammels? Or it needs more? I got 4,920 platinum. Make sure you use some of those pyramids we made, though. 1,500 per trammel? Of platinum. Okay. We're fine. Yeah. Can you get your calculator out? Never mind. I can do this it myself. You might shatter that jug. Can I fly around and see what we can see? We've got a trough! We're cheering them on the side. Good forging! Fold that metal. Oh god. All right, here we go. Does he need inspiration? Scanlan? Yeah. Don't do it. Get it off of there, Grog. No, he hasn't used it. (gasps) Try it again. I'm going to over and rub his muscles. Do you want to inspire him again, Scanlan? Oh no! Try one more time. Can he try again? Try it, though. Oh, motherfuck. Do you get any more inspiration, Scanlan? Okay, but now you can add things. So he can still add one d4 on this? He needs as much as you can give him, Scanlan. So one? (laughter) Now we got to twist them? Does he have any more inspiration? Wait, keep inspiring. But he hasn't announced it. Like what? Whisper? Can we look around for a little teeny hammer? 12 for me, so probably not so much. Have you picked it up? Maybe it changes shape. Cat's Grace is what, dexterity? We might be able to fix it. Oh my god! I'm looking. I've got nothing. This is a step up from fine leather boots, Grog. Or are you tapped out? Do you have any spells left, Scanlan? So we head into the mansion. If we're in the mansion, he can't see us. So that's the only thing. It might be good to rest inside the mansion so he can't attack us before we attack him. We don't know. Fuck it, we'll do it live! TALIESIN and No, he's not. I saw his balls. I saw his golden balls. Oh goodness gracious, we got to get all of our stuff. Do we need to bring our own binder to GenCon?
