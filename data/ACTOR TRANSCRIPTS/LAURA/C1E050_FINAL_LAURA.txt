That is correct. It'll be going up very soon. Do it now, he just said it! Yeah they did! She's actually shot all of our photos from the very beginning. She's freaking amazing. We're all wearing our shirts So what does that mean, Ashley? It's Alternative Apparel and it's super-duper-super-duper cozy inside. You could use it as a pillow, you could use it as a hoodie. Dinner, you could wear it to dinner. Just a few packages. I'm sure they're really thrilled about that. It is masterworks. Well, I want that bow. (laughs) He healed us all up before we left, right? Yeah? What time is it? It's mid-day! So maybe we should hang out in the mouth of the cave and take a short rest Yes? Maybe we should take a long rest. Unless I was healed, and I don't remember being healed, I'm at 11 health points. So I'm feeling a little sore. He healed me back to my age. Did you get aged? I was and he healed me. He's really fucking old right now. Look at all those wrinkles. His ears are starting to droop! Are you sure you want to do it, Pike, are you sure? Shorty rest and then we'll walk. I mean, I could roll my own hit dice. Who you talking to, Grog? Yeah, sure. Yeah I did, I think I did take quite a bit of chicken. Aw, the chicken, we can't take it. That's okay, I've got boar meat. Do you want to feed your stomach the boar meat? I'll mark it down to half the boar meat is gone now, you guys. Well, he's a big guy. That's right. Well? You have to roll again? No joke, though! We all run out. I slap him across the face. Oh yeah, 19! Can you Greater Restoration him? Don't break it! What do you mean, his soul could be inside of it? How can he be, how can he be dead? He wouldn't know anything about these-- Can we go back in? What about going back to Kamal? No, but he's right inside the cave, what if he knows things? The sphinx! Me and Scanlan go back into the cave and search for Kamal again. Me and Scanlan take flight and we go back in and we try to find Kamal again. Shit! Has it been a minute? He just did it, it just happened! We just ran over! Oh my god. Is that stupid? (laughs anxiously) Okay, okay. Then I reach into the Bag of Holding and I get out Grog's cask of ale. Okay. I pour a little in his mouth. Just a little bit, so he doesn't choke. I turn his head so he doesn't drown in it. This is so stressful. 16? He's taking a picture I know, yeah, it's either really good or really bad. Matthew! Oh my god! What the fuck is that sword, Grog? What? How come he's getting a whisper and you're not getting a whisper? Hey, you guys (sobbing) check out those "How Do You Want to do This" hoodies-- (laughter) Oh my god, you came back and Grog died! Grog, you died! Yes. You did. Pike saved you. Pike brought you back. Shit. Can we see what's going on? I run over and I block it. I stand next to Percy and I block the sword. Percy gave it to you? Grog! The sword pulled you into it! You were dead, your soul was with whatever the fuck is in there now. Pike saved you. Nobody should touch the sword, Percy. I feel like it's going to try and suck anybody in right now. No. Can we talk to it? I mean, can we see what it is? The shadow's not there anymore? I mean, what did it sound like? Four out of seven! He has a third testicle. It's out. There, I said it! Horses don't try to steal your soul, Grog. Oh. It was Lord Briarwood. Maybe some bone knuckles? I hear those are pretty badass. Giant's bone? No, how about we just wrap it in fabric. No? But I do think that whatever it is might know something. Do not use it against Kevdak. You don't want something making your strength unnatural when you fight your new foe. You'll chop off your own leg-- He's got a Vestige. He's still just him. That's right. No, there's a little left in the cask, here. Here's your cask. The Dread Emperor that we already killed. No! Somebody could use it. No. How about you throw it in that pocket dimension and then we can always go to that same pocket dimension and get it if we decide it's bad there. Drop it in a thorny patch. Do you have any more 5th-level? Oh, you do? Why not try it? Before we send it. You're at--? Okay. Bam! Shebang. What do you think Greater Restoration will do? I'm afraid it will make whatever's in the sword come out. But if it comes out then we can banish it or kill it and-- It will be just a useless sword at that point. Fucking try it, Pike! Oh, that's good. What just happened? Drop the sword. Eat it, Craven Edge! Well? Fingers crossed nobody gets it. We can just fucking hang out for a day. She's out of spells. Yeah, he's got so many weapons. Ooh! That's good. Yeah, but this one gives her fire resistance. Does she have to-- in the levitation boots, can you move? We could tie her onto the broom, we could tie her onto the broom! We just short-rested, but now we're going to sleep. It's been a traumatic five minutes. Oh, in the mansion, fuck, we'll sleep in the mansion. --that we have that. Triple the wrinkles, triple the nuts. You want to work on it? Or you want to fly around? Can I stand next to you while you work on it? Would that bother you? Oh, Percy, I just want to see what you're doing. By like two whole minutes. Yes. I pop Trinket out, of course, so he can hang out. Shake it out. Run around, get some exercise, I feel like an asshole for keeping you in this thing. Sure. Percy? I feel safer already. I would love that. What it had done to you? Can I see, can we see it? Why? Come on. Yay! I float on my broom. And keep an eye out in front for any sort of problems. Shh! Yes, I'm leading. Would you have kept it if you had known all those other things? Or would you have wanted to use more of it? Oh, shit. Do any of our people have Identify? Don't act like you know for sure. (laughter) 26. Oh! Did you want to look for that lake, or are you good, Grog? Doesn't it lead into the Fey world? The plane? In the Fey world? We should probably, but I do want to come back here. Oh. Let's go to Westruun! Oh, shit. (laughter) Aw, because you saw it. What if I'm on the broom, though? No, we're coming back soon because we're going into the Feywild. I think Keyleth wants a reward. Where'd he find the wood? I thought there were no trees around. Pretty traumatizing, I would assume. Yes. If all goes well, you may be able-- no, I don't know. It may be a while, but we're trying. Was there anything else you wanted to do, Keyleth? All right. Okay, what are we, what's our plan here, Grog? What do you think, Grog, what do you want to do? Walk right into town? A rematch, I would think. But they think you're dead. As smart as you? Well, he's in the mayor's-- Yeah, but if the city, if the rest of them don't see him defeating Kevdak, then it's worthless. They need to watch it happen. But what's to keep Grog safe in the meantime? I don't want to abandon Grog to a fight with Kevdak while we're freeing villagers. No offense to them. I want to have Grog's back. What if we stay hidden? Yeah. Which you kind of did, Grog. So wait, we stay hidden and you call lightning. Warhammer? You gained the ability to grow a beard in the afterlife. It's pretty major. Kill Kevdak. It's a pride issue. Grog, would you engage in a fight with a magical being who wronged you, if you thought you were better than him? Nice beret there, Scanlan. That's right! He's full of shit. And if we remove all of the villagers, it'll definitely gain the attention of the dragons. Yeah. What if we do the same thing that those orcs did? When you go in and cause a distraction and lead them out, we spend the few days that we're waiting for the dragons to build a massive trench, you can use Move Earth, and lead them all out over something and drop a Herd of goliaths. Drop them into a trench, they're stuck in there while he fights Kevdak. Can we aid you? This isn't like the Crucible. Smart. Sure? We're keeping a good distance, as we get closer, so it lasts, I cast Pass Without a Trace on us. Add ten because I cast Pass Without a Trace. That's really good. Plus ten. Yeah, because I cast Pass Without a Trace on us. 33. 32. Was his name Frederick? No, it was with an 'r'. Oh, that you killed? I rolled a better stealth than him, though. Oh, that's so much better! No, it's good. 30. They're going to see he's missing. I can fashion something. Reginald. We're so sorry. We will rescue your daughter. Oh shit. It's coming tomorrow. That means tomorrow it's coming back. Is that it, or one more? Which is actually worse. We need to put something back up. I don't want anyone else to get hurt. Grog. I agree. Don't! Pass it over. She's full-on reading it! Oh, I want to know what it says so fucking bad! The cube. Over and over and over again. We're still outside. That's one less fuck we have to worry about. It's possible. I have a feeling they're having a hard time finding any sort of hoard to offer after this many days. Fuck. Yes? It's possible. If Grog can take control of the Herd, they may be able to fight with us. But I wouldn't trust them. We need to tell the others. Well. Dragon came. Not happy. You'll be glad to know, however, that it took one of your Herd away with it. Yes, that's what I think as well. Yes. Not much. What are you going to do when a dragon comes and takes someone away? Stand there and watch, really. They may not be very happy with the dragon right now. They may not care at all. So we start today, yes? While Grog shits, I'm just going to take a little nap, while he's shitting, it takes a while usually, right? Something to recover a little bit of time. I'll be right back. Oh no. Blocked. Don't say that! At least it gets them out of commission. Yeah. Good. I like it. If he brought his father back to fight underneath him. Wow. He had an intelligence of four. So this is only your fake father walking up at this point. Yes. We're going to kill Kevdak. He's going to kill Kevdak. That's true, I could be hiding behind you and drag you. You could be a fucking triceratops again, for all-- Oh my god, that's amazing. Oh my gosh, a floating severed head? Yeah. But you can make the illusion of a head talking. The head is so perfect. The head. Be a head! Be a giant, floating, severed head, I like it. Me? I mean, I can use the tether and tie you to the broom. Do it. Come on, Scanlan. I'm standing nearby on my broom. I'll fly in and pick him up. He can Dimension Door out, though, very quickly. It's okay. Yes. LAURA and Fuck yeah. Can you dig a hole under and we can hang out in a hole with something over top of it so we can bust up out, like shallow ground? But we have to be able to get out of it. Okay. And then we go in. We stay at the very edge, stealthed as fuck. I already did! Ten. What time is it? It saw you? You're invisible! No no no no no. Oh, he's out of range. Shit. He's out of two miles' range? It's a 15-minute walk, though. You're a fast walker for a gnome. Oh, again with the crows. Look, your god is here to help us. She sounds like shit. MARISHA and I feel like this is the first time I've seen you at a loss. Oh god. Oh my god, Scanlan, run. Okay, yeah yeah, it's all you. What? Do we hear the bell? Why am I cheering? He stole from us. Again! Again!
