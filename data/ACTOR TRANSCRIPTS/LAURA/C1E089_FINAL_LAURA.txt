What? You're going to vomit. You're going to vomit, Sam. Oh god! He does have a towel down. Oh no. He's going to spew. Don't do it! Did you do it? Did he just do it? He's going to kill himself. Sam, get that shit out of your mouth. I'm going to throw up. That was so fucking gross. Samuel! I'm just going to throw up. It's so gross. (muffled) Aw man, I put food in my mouth! Oh, hey! How's it going, guys? We have a-- don't you touch my donuts. We have all of the normal, wonderful stuff still available in the store. The stuff that's out of stock, actually, has been removed so that you don't get confused when you're looking for things. So we have our Gilmore shirt, we got our Strongjaw shirt, we got a 'How do you want to do this' shirt, with the hoodie. We got baseball caps, we got patches, we got vinyl stickers, which I am still a really big fan of. They go on windshields, Macbooks, whatever you want. Pets! Not recommended. So yeah, check it out if you wanna wear your Critical Role goodies. Ey! Bada-bing, bada-boom, there you go. It's amazing. We thought it was for all of us but then we realized it was just for Matt and Marisha. Phenomenal. No! Did you plan that? That you were almost vomiting today, and you vomited and ruined our lives? You! There it is. (laughs) Distappeared. I flip him over and look at him. Vax! Vax, wake up! Is there a cleric on the island? I start dragging his body. How big is that? That's tight. Where are we going? Oh no, I'm holding onto her, right? Please! Are there any clerics here? He's-- He's dead. No. No, he won't claim him. What can we do? How do we even know they're alive? Please hurry. How do we know if it worked? How much time does-- How long is too long? I start brushing his hair off of his face. There are other options. I don't care what he looks like. I just want him back. Don't let anything harm him. (tearfully) It's Vax. I know nothing. I look. For any sort of message from the Raven Queen on his armor. 20. What's five plus seven? No! 22. 22. Can I pull it out? What is it? I'm going to open it. My-- Fuck. Oh no. No. I just put it back in the armor. There's nothing. Can we start? He's been here for a while. I'm sorry to bring you into this so quickly, Pike. I'll mark it off. I'll do it. I kneel down next to him, and I take the feathers from behind my ear, and I start braiding them into his hair, and I say, you were always better at this than I was, but you gave me these feathers in one of my darkest hours to remind me of the beauty in the world, so I'm giving them to you now, because you take the beauty with you. I've done this so many times. We've brought so many of us back, but this feels different, right? I feel as if I'm not speaking to Vax, I feel as though I'm speaking directly to Her. No. No, he's at her side, but it's being filtered through the Raven Queen. So these are my words to her. I'm here today because of a bargain my brother made with you, so I know you like to make deals as much as I do. He traded his life. He became your champion, and you spared mine, and what a striking champion he is. Long dark hair and a strong lithe figure soaring over the land in raven feathers and a dark vestige. He set pyres in your honor. Sent soul after soul to you. It would be a shame to give that up, especially now. And I remember the book that I read. Especially now as Orcus builds his forces against you. The demon prince of the undead seeks to claim your throne. You know this as well as I. We just recently killed one of his loyal servants in the Underdark, before my brother ever came into your service. Imagine what he could do now. So this is the deal I make with you you send him back, allow my brother to come home, and we will seek out Orcus. I will track him down, I will hunt him in whatever pit he resides, and we will destroy your enemy once and for all. What say you? 25. Oh! Oh god, oh god. He always does that. Vesrah. You're alive. (laughs) Hey, that queen, she's pretty scary looking, huh? (laughs) Hey, Pike. Pike's here. (shaky laughter) She fixed you. Hey welcome to the club. Yeah, all that's left now is Keyleth. Oh! Do you need to rest? Do you need to go lay down? Well yes, but-- Oh. I pull mine out as well. How many people lose their lives on their Aramente? How many people complete it? How many people did she have with her? What are you talking about, 'who is that'? What are you talking about, that is Taryon. I didn't think it was published yet. You forgot to mention the part where you vomited and blew our cover. Thank you. Um, Pike. And they're speaking this whole time in Gnome? Oh, until later, okay, okay. Uh-huh. So we'll heal up now. Can we be on the beach? I like it. Like a hair bit, or like a hair bit that goes like this? Ooh! Yeah! I like it. (laughs) All of. I've only got two of 'em and they're both in his hair. What for? Like you do. Oh! It's wonderful, it's a little morbid and wonderful at the same time. That's so wonderful, Keyleth. That's so thoughtful. What a bummer! Oh, I feel like somebody that just got party invitations, it's like oh, I ran out! You could always get it back from him if he decides to leave our presence. It could be safe, if he's--- Just let him know it's to hold it. He doesn't know our names. Trinket goes up and pees on Doty's leg. Oh, Trinket, that's not a tree. That's a robot. Yeah. It'll come off. Don't worry. (laughs) Don't worry, Percy, he makes it-- (gasps) Yeeeah! I love this game! How do you even have strength for this right now? (laughs) In what? Oh, right! I thought you meant in size. Yes, I have. (laughs) We've always known that. Yes, we do. I don't know if that's going to happen, dear. I sort of made a promise to your queen. Could you hear it on the other side? When we were trying to bring you back, I kind of sort of-- And I come down off of his feet (laughs) and stand up-- I kind of, sort of promised her we would hunt down Orcus. I mean, I was trying to get you back. I know that is really hard and we probably are going to have a very hard time finding Orcus and killing him since he's like, you know, a god, I think-- Hey, you're here now! (snaps fingers) I'm sorry. Yeah, right? Stupid decisions to bring the people you love back to your side. Very stupid. Stupid to be a champion, stupid to kill Orcus, stupid all around. No, no, no! I just kind of said we'd go and do it. So, it could be, you know. Ah, I just said we would do it. (laughs) Yeah. Yeah. I have a feeling she pulls our fate strings anyway. She'll make sure we get there. Mine's connected to yours. Wherever you go, I go. Unless it's, you know-- (laughs) Aw! I'm glad you're back. (claps) Grog! That was amazing! I write ten on a sheet of paper and hold it up. (all laugh) I have it in my bag. I know. It will fall off of your form. Ooh, seashell bras. With salt crusted on it. What about the prisoner? Is he still on board? All right. Is she stuck like that? Okay. What is this?! What is this?! What the fuck?! What is this?! But like, that's really big. How? How is this possible? Is she like a dragon for real? Does anybody--? No. I feel far less nervous about this Orcus thing now. Ha. (laughs) TRAVIS and That's insane. Can't you talk as a dragon? Can't dragons talk? I like the idea that it's just like your regular-ass voice coming out of-- What the fuck. What is this? Like, this is amazing, Keyleth. We should have completed your Aramente a lot sooner. Yes! And Pike! Pike wanted to go too. Wow. That's pretty fucking sick. Yeah! Sweet! It's a ninth-level spell. Wait. Dragons are your level? Okay. Wow, still, adult dragon is like, right on par. Oh my god. And you can do all the things that they can do? Ah! I'd say that's pretty fucking sick. Ah man. I imagine that I've been introducing Pike to the whole crew. Since you like to sail so much. Doodie. She's fucking cool. Yeah. I'm there. 29. As our faces are like-- Yeah. (all laugh) 'Til it looks like a good angle, at least. Oh no! (gasps) Oh god. (laughs) Gets ya every time. (gasps) Oh god. Ho ho ho! That was awesome. Where can we study? The Cobalt Reserve? Is it still standing at all in Emon? Are there any books left? Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Probably need to start studying Orcus as well. All those killer whales. No! Back home? No, no, she's okay, she's fine. Nice. Mm-hm. No, I'm sure I did, marked it down, so. Oh no, I didn't, because we had decided on 150 gold per day. So, we went back quicker than we thought so three days back, five days there? And then how many days were we in-- So ten? So just over 1,000 gold, that's good. Are you going to write her an IOU? Taryon, really? Wow. Thank you, Taryon. I'm going to stand by your side as you pay her. Taryon, thank you. All right. Wow. Can I just pull Keyleth aside as we come on land? And just say, I was very impressed with you. For a long time, I've harbored a bit of doubt, I'm sorry to say, and when you brought us away from the kraken, I was very angry and very fearful. But you've proven yourself, so much, and I want to say I'm sorry. I believe in you. We all did it willingly. He especially. Well, we still have some things to take care of. We have a crown to get on your head. I can't believe you're going to be royalty. Royalty-royalty. Rule royalty. That's pretty fucking cool, Keyleth. Ah, well. Keyleth. I'm glad my brother found you. I'm glad we all found you. Love-love. I know, right? To the keep, we need to stop by the library. Yeah, let's go to Greyskull. Yay! Who all came back? I was so worried about them! You're doing a great job. Yeah. Oh! He's coming over-- whispers about Erwen. Yeah, it's Greyskull Keep. I know, right? Unfortunately, not too long. There were fucking dragons, Tary! Dragons! (laughs) This is ridiculous. What? Uh. I go to the library. You already got his ascot, don't you? (laughs) What're we doing? Researching something. Hotis? And like the Nine Hells. All of it. Ooh! 26! Investigation. We got to go somewhere better. There's a library here. The Cobalt Reserve. It was just kind of smashed, but I wonder if there's still books there. Just kidding. It's in Westruun. Hey! I was just wrong about, yeah, the city. That's it. What do you think? No. (laughs) Shall we go to Westruun? No. That's where we'll go to? Yeah? Tight? Tight? Draconic, Abyssal. I can read Abyssal. I read Abyssal. Do you need help because we both speak Abyssal? Right. That one feels, is like super scary-looking, though, right? Does it have writing on the cover? But Gilmore looked at that. I had Gilmore look at it and he said it was scary. Right. Question. DM? What would will-- is that wisdom? Okay. He said whoever read it had to be careful. Whoa! Pike should read it. Pike's got crazy wisdom, we should make her look at it. I mean, maybe Pike should look at it. Gilmore looked at it. On the book? We should have Pike look at this. Pike! Look at this. Wait, wait, I just wanted to-- oh god. It's just a dark book, we found it in Raishan, well in-- Opash's lair. Gilmore said to be careful of it. We're just sort of afraid it will take over someone's mind or something. Ohh. Pike is really, really wise. Close your eyes as soon as you unlock it. (laughs) I back away. I'm in the doorway, man. (laughs) Oh no, what's that face? What's that face? Yeah, do it. Do it! I mean, do it if you want to. I'm standing in the doorway. A little bit. (gasps) Well, it's just open, it's just an open book. Just air. What does it say? What is it? What does it look like? Shit. Aw, fuck. Oh, no. What? Lemme see-- how much-- how wise are you? You're not even as wise as I am. (laughs) I'm gonna step up. I'm gonna go up and try to look at it. Yeah. Yeah? This is a gir-nal. (gasps) Which I also read. Oh my gosh. But we killed her. This could have been so much worse. What does Bless do? Don't fuck me, Gil! Oh, tight. Okay, 16. It's just saving throw? 18 + 3 is 21, plus two. 23. Oh, okay. Oh wait, (whispers) 18, 19, 20, 23 (louder) 25. Oh no, that's a 16, I'm sorry! I was right, it was 23. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm a dick! I shut the book. Great. I tell them everything I read. Super fast 'cause I'm, like, a speed reader it's no big deal. Oh shit! Well, it was a big journal. I read most of it and then I just threw the book away. Well-- Should we destroy this thing? I feel like maybe, I mean-- It's true. All right. Okay, no, okay. That's something. No, Grog! Should we destroy-destroy this? It certainly felt like something was trying to reach through. And what good does it do the world to know how to bring back souls as the undead? It seems kind of dark. Well, we have a bag of holding. All terrible things. Oh no! Let's keep it in the bag of holding for the time being. Definitely. Re-lock it. Re-lock it. I concur. We're going to go to Westruun. Right? Well, Wildmount is far north. Raishan said she was from Wildmount. She was? Dedicated to Vecna. Sure. Oh. Yeah. Not in a huge rush. Yeah. We'll shop in Emon in the morning and then head out to Westruun. They'll have shops there, too. Just not as many. (sings) Everybody's still alive for the time being. Those donuts were pretty fucking great. I don't know if all of us-- Yay! It's because they made your part so big this season. You're so talented and amazing. Oh my gosh. Ugh, gross! Do not touch that, Taliesin. Ew.
