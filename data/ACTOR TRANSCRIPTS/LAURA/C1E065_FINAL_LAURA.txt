It's got Futurama stuff on it. But it's not. Fans don't get to vote. More than it was. Sam walked away so he wouldn't be on the same set as you were saying that. Oh! Yeah, I think we need to spend at least the night in Whitestone and get up in the morning. There's more coming, dear. Sorry you can't be out having your fun, dear. Maybe we can stop through on our way back. We are going to Marquet, aren't we? Gilmore. Gilmore's from Marquet. It's up. As long as the dragon's not here and attacking. How are we even going to get a beast? I think a large enough beast to attract Vorugal. He said they hunted remorhaz? Oh. Those are big and scary. And Vorugal will go to the creature. I know, because I'm an expert. We could ask Zahra, but she's busy with research. Yeah. Let's go find Kashaw. Did we ever talk to Cassandra or anyone else about starting an alarm system here? Maybe he's not the best messenger if he's training our armies. All right. It's not just a messenger, it's defeating a dragon. No, we take a contract on a really large creature, and then we let the dragon do the work for us. We get the best of both worlds. He hunts them. That's what he does. Well, then we're going to have to fucking go to the Slayer's Take. This'll be great. And Vanessa really likes you. Thank you. We have 40 pounds of dragonhide. Black dragonhide. We don't have white dragonhide. No, that's Keyleth's, remember? In the next century, when she's still living. No, they do. They lose a contract. No, if the dragon kills the creature and then we all die and we can't harvest it, the Slayer's Take doesn't have anything from its previous contract. Well, fuck it. While all this is going on, Grog, you could be training these soldiers. Seriously? Don't kill them, Grog! Hey bonus, he's on our side. Eh? That's encouraging. Yeah? Don't you have wings? Yes. And make sure to include that this must all be completed within 14 days. Yes, that's what he said. That's part of that listening thing, Scanlan. Kashaw. No mention of Whitestone at all. Anywhere you go. Very important. Do we have a way to get him there very quickly? He's a really smart man. Yeah, but then he'll pop where we are. Don't worry about it. Don't you want to walk with them? So now that that's handled, are we leaving today? We've got a limited amount of time on this. Did it sound like anyone we knew? Is everything okay? How are you holding up, Gilmore? Oh! You got a whisper on a 15. Actually, the shirt you're wearing, Sam, is from Loot Wear. Well, we plan to go to Marquet. Things have progressed much quicker than we expected it to, and unfortunately we are on a two-week time crunch before all hell breaks loose. How does his house look? Does it look together like it would normally be, or does it look disheveled at all? We are looking for a merchant warrior. Outside of you, do you know of any very powerful merchants? One with a missing eye? We should talk to him. To them? We're very interested to start paying you for your service again, Gilmore, and stop expecting it for free. Oh, believe me. I have, as well. This locket will take a nice little chunk off of that tally. Thank you. Do you have any to-go cups? (laughs) Just kidding. I'm surprised you even know how many eight gallons is, Grog. Wow. I walk off and look for Jarett. You can tell us all about where you're from, actually. Did you leave Marquet a long time ago? Oh, really? What did you do? Me neither. (laughs nervously) Have you heard about the Den of Drujah. Drujah. It's unscrupulous. All right. It's like the Man in Black. It's this famous tale of the Princess Bride. Don't worry about it. Like the dragon. A very small town. Is it a long trek from there to the city? Wow. Shit. Do you remember, in all your time there, did you ever deal with-- this is completely ridiculous-- a merchant who only had one eye? I can't even imagine you like that. Be pleased. Don't drink the water. Be pleased. We'll work on it. Keep everyone safe? I didn't realize Marquet was like Emon. This might be a bit difficult, to find a one-eyed merchant in a city bigger than Emon. This is true. We've only got two weeks. Fuck. Oh, but are we going to get some water jugs and shit like that before we leave? We need to get some potions. How many jugs did we get? Five jugs? And we fill up our wineskins with water. You're going to be a gross, sweaty, greasy mess. Over your other cloaks. Perfect. Thank you, Gilmore! Anywhere. Can I get a little dagger through and flip the latch? Drink! Good thing no one destroyed this thing while he was gone. Every carpet here. I look under the bed. Can I reach them? Is the box trapped? Almost good, and then not. 14. Can I open it? Is it Gilmore's stuff? I'm just seeing if this is his room! Okay. I fold them back up and I put them under the bed. I was seeing if we were in Gilmore's room, that's all. Yeah. Don't act like I'm a dick. I'm not stealing the letters. I'm putting the shirts back, all right? Is the door open? Can we go out of here? Shaun. He's quite well. He's very powerful, actually, and has wonderful businesses, all through-- No, I know. It's just not there anymore. He does. So well, yes. Very respected. Actually, we need to head out pretty quickly. Can you tell us the direction to Ank'Harel? Yes. Thank you. I'm assuming these are the people that Gilmore said I would know. Yes, so as she's doing that, I want to pull out the locket and say, actually, Shaun asked me to deliver this to you. Thank you. I understand. Oh yes. Can you give them some water from our jug? Would you like some water? What time is it here? No, we aren't going to make it to Ank'Harel by dark. Yes, of course. That's all. Thank you! You broke him! Yeah, unless we see any kind of potion shops here. Let's mist it. That would be the worst thing ever. Let's do it. As I turn into mist, I go I'm melting! Melting! Oh, what a world! 20. Eight hours, right? It lasts eight hours? Can we get the whole way there? Yeah, I've got an excellent sense of direction. And we can camp just outside the city, maybe? Should we mist down? It's still night? It's good to camp. We mist down a little bit. And the gates to the city are closed at night? Can we see guards around? Do they look aggressive? We can see your piece of paper on the screen. Still see it. We should probably land far away. Wine, definitely wine. All right! Shall we camp in the mansion, then? So comfortable. Yeah. We're off a little bit. Do the people seem friendly? Do they seem tired? 22. How about we keep a distance? No, let's keep a distance from them and be another group of people coming into the city. No, but they have to document who goes in and out. Can we have the mansion, Scanlan? He already did that. I'm going to watch you do it. The guards are guarding. Anybody that approaches is a threat. I stand in the doorway. Be pleased. Wait, is magic not allowed within the city? Thank you for the warning. Magic is allowed, but this is strange magic. How will we know what isn't strange magic? I hold the door open. Wonderful. No, I want to go to sleep, and I'm holding on to Fenthras and thinking about everything. Oh. (retching) I go back in my room. I'm about to throw up. Fine. And I go in my room and I sit down on the opposite side of the room. Hold on, it's not been a minute. All right. No, I'm happy for you. As foul as it is. What are you doing? What? Oh, that was so amazing. (soft laugh) Jesus Christ. Really? Right now? He knew a lot of things, yes. I don't think he was completely wrong, and that's what makes me feel terrible. Well, he was right about the dagger. That's good, because I am really weak. (laughs) Thank you. Thank you. It makes me happy to see you happy. Yeah, right? Oh, that. Yeah, I killed a couple people and I saved Trinket, that's all. Do you remember when I brought Trinket back to camp? Yeah! All those years ago? (laughs) Well... turns out, I found him in a camp where I'd been taken. Yes, and there was some really dark people there, and they had harvested-- Trinket's mother. Bless you. Is Scanlan in the room? I did what I had to do, and I killed them. Yes. I did. Yes. And I saved Trinket that night, and that's what Saundor saw. More than anything I just... I don't know how he saw it. I'm not. Right? (sniffles) Rung it. (laughs) No! It's good. We all need to self-reflect every once in a while. I needed it. My heart is in the right place. I know it is. I'm just afraid sometimes actions speak louder than intentions. If things I was doing could be read the wrong way, then... maybe I need to change what I do. It's fine, dear. (laughs) No, please. I'm so happy to see you happy. Don't worry about me. I'm fine! And I can talk to Trinket now. We talk all the time. We've talked through a lot. Right? Yes? (laughs) I love you. "Should you need me." Oh, yeah, no. Maybe go take a shower. Yeah, maybe something other than chicken. Something with veggies? Oh, they speak? They're learning. Delicious. How about no? This is the ploy. It's a million. Is anybody looking at Trinket weird, or is it okay? He's with us. The Suncut Bazaar. Yeah. As we look around, do we see any markets? Actually, the shopping district would be a wonderful place to look for-- I'm not looking in the direction. I'm keeping my eyes on them the entire time he's talking. 20. No. We walk towards the Suncut Bazaar, keeping an eye out. Are the shops here indoors, or are they outdoor tent markets? Do we see any spice merchants? 11. I peek around her shoulder. Where would the Shade be? Thank you so much. No going up from that. That's what it is. What are you looking for? Can I have seen Percy looking around? Can I help him look? What are you looking for, dear? It's very colorful. What sorts of things? Investigation? 19. Want to walk up? Yeah? No, actually. We sit down in front of him. Should I put five or 15, for each of us? With one eye. Can I insight check him as he's reading the cards? See if his face twitches at all, if it looks like he's making shit up. 21? Okay. And the third question? Goddamn it. Five more gold. I as quietly as possible put another five gold in front of him. Did I make the right choice? Be pleased. That was so cool! Well, that's the Shade. Should we head that direction? Grog? Do you want to bring your rock? Fuck. Yes. Scanlan, we're heading towards the Shade. It's the big green tent. Follow? We're at the Shade! You have drugs with you? Did Scanlan get here yet? Are we staying here? It's not very private. Can I find a patron that seems chill? I walk up. Be pleased. Actually, just a small trifle. Are you staying here? Lovely. We're from out of town-- Yes, and I've noticed the Shade is rather open. Do you know if the Corner Cove or Debt's Respite are quite as private as this, or do they have actual rooms? Oh. Lovely. Are they far from here? Thank you. Sorry to bother you. Some cards? She's a merchant in town. We've been looking for her. She's quite strong, actually. Yeah, she is a Scarbearer. Are they around here? Oh, are they? Do we? We've got a ticking time bomb! We do need to talk to him, actually. Do you mind if we join you? I motion to the waitress. Could we have some more Dusk Sage? Oh, of course! Yeah, we go get our own. Good to know. Thank you, Grog. TALIESIN and Scanlan. Spice dealer? Are you going to wear red? Well, I'll go with you. Of course I'm cool. I'm so cool, darling. Do you think maybe the reason Jarett was almost arrested was because of this fucking spice? What the hell was he thinking? Aren't they going to be looking for a very little man? Why does Scanlan never think I'm very cool? Why does he think that? You never want me to go with you, I could've helped you find Kaylie, and you didn't ask me to. You're the one who fucking makes me wear this thing! I'm not flying. I can take it off whenever I fucking want! We're sitting and hookah-ing through this whole fucking thing. Good job, brother. Good job. Wow, you've never looked cooler in your entire life. That's from your personal fucking funds! That ain't no party funds. 700. TRAVIS 700. Here's 800 gold. We're saving a bottle. But don't take your sword out, because we're not allowed to bring our weapons out. I want a shot. Oh shit. Oh, he's fucking wasted. Oh shit. I'm not drinking mine. Here, Grog. Are you going to try it, Grog? (laughter) Back in the mansion, maybe. But not when we have to do something tonight. As charming as you two are right now. Can I step out and find that waiter that we paid for? Wonderful beverages you just served us. How long does that last? Just a tiny bit. Fabulous. They came with quite a price tag, didn't they? I could assume. What exactly is in? I'm assuming, I mean, back in the city that we're from-- Thank you so much. Where we're from, usually when purchasing such a great and expensive item, room service is included. I'm assuming we have somewhere to stay for the night? Oh. Cultural differences! Good to know. We need to go find the Debt's Respite and maybe get a room. That's where the Scarbearers are. We can get a room here. 26. But they said this was being guarded by the Hand of Ord. Interesting. No, the guard at the front of the city told us this was one of the places that you could stay, and it was guarded. Are they wearing a cloak? So they don't have something up? Do they have a hood over their head? Tail or no tail? Wow. I guess I walk up to the tavernkeep. I grab one of the barmaids. Who do we speak to about a room? Oh. Well, there we go. I walk over. Sorry, sir. We're interested in a room for the night, actually. Vex'ahlia. Wonderful. Mind if I sit down? We're actually here on a rather important mission from Emon. It was quite a beautiful city. Not as much anymore. Yes, it does. Yes. Three, you said? And how much would those rooms be? Six of us? Well, yes, but he doesn't take up much space. "A bear tax?" You know what? He can sleep outside, don't worry. Don't worry about the bear. Thank you. (whispers) Ten gold? (louder) Are these really fancy rooms, then? Every fucking thing is expensive here. Can I insight and see if he's just taking fucking advantage of us because we're tourists? I don't want to roll that one. I want to roll this one. Natural 20! You know what? We probably don't need the three rooms. They offered us some over at The Shade. It's fine. Are you from Tal'Dorei? No. So you haven't heard of Draconia? Can I see from here if he has a tail or not? Have you heard? Have you heard what happened? Draconia has fallen. No. Well, I'd be happy to tell you more detail for a reasonable price on the rooms. So we tell him. While he's talking, can I keep an eye on the figure in the corner? 30 perception. Are any items allowed in the bowl, or do you have to go in bare-handed? UFC. Good to know. How's his handwriting? What if we just-- Just to meet with her. Oh yes, of course! Thank you for the rooms. Oh, hi! Let's go to the rooms. Let's check it out. How about that? Thank you for the rooms. Breakfast? Is there breakfast here? Awesome. Oh, I would follow suit. 13. Scanlan, then. Me and you? No. I'm kidding. I don't want to be in the same room with you at all. No. You're with him. Yes. What did you see? And you didn't even have to say jenga! Do you have a red shirt, Scanlan? Do we need to get you one? And potions. We need potions. You flirted with grass better! Or at least put in for an audience. Does it seem like a long walk towards the Cerulean Palace? What time's the sun set here? Can I ask somebody? Forgive us for our intrusion. We come seeking an audience of J'mon Sa Ord. He's in the room with us? I'm up and pacing the room, trying to pace near the door that she went through so I can keep an ear on the door. Can I hear anything from the other side of the door? I didn't want to have my ear against the wall. I wanted to be subtly doing it. That happened much easier than I expected. Are you sure, Grog? This is miraculous! Oh shit, two weeks. Some of us are done.
