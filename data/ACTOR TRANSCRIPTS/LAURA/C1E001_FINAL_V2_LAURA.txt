Hi. I'm Laura Bailey. I'm also, you know, a voice actor like everyone here. I'm playing Vex'ahlia. The coolest chick ever. The ranger with the bear named Trinket, in case you didn't catch that. His name is Trinket and he's amazing. Oh no. No, we had a way in. But, Ashley speaks Dwarvish. Pike speaks-- Oh good! Those are actually pig pits, isn't it? I bring out a piece of gold. Please, sir, we're looking for a place to stay that isn't covered in mud. Thank you, sir. I like your armor by the way. It was. That's all I do is wink at people. We grab a table next to the dwarves with Grog. A sack of gold, are you crazy?! What was her name? You want to share a room? Probably like 15 gold then for just that amount. What's the discount? Yes. That works. I think I did the math wrong. Gah! I hate not having a calculator! Fine! The carvas. Of course. The scar! We might have business with you, if you've seen a halfling come through. The Firebrook. Yes, Greyspine. Unfortunately for us. Right. So No-stock. Nostoc? Nostoc Greyspine. You said that he's kind of a--? Oh. Where is he located, exactly? Of course not. Does your friend ever have drinks here? "No. He's been sober for two years. We're not "friends anymore." Tugs on his beard a little bit. What time of day is it? Do dwarves carry the same schedule? Does anyone know? 18, plus, what is that? Investigation? Or insight? Oh. 20, then. All right. Good to know. Right! MATT and Check out the Firebrook Inn, yes. That was where Lady Kima was staying. Also, I think somebody should run reconnaissance on Greyspine Manor. No. Yeah, but he's very-- Well, let's ask him. Maybe he's drunk enough to help us. Saddle up, Grog! People seem to like you here. Yes, take him a drink. A very large drink. Just a little of his drunkenness, not all of his drunkenness. (whispered) Talk to him about fighting first. Lost cause. Abandon ship! Okay. Why would you throw this to us? Persuasion. Oh! Good roll. Woo! Oh! Hello, Balgus. We just heard you're so impressive and masculine. We really wanted to talk to you. Oh sh-- okay. Roll so good. Oh no, what was it? Sorry about my friend, Balgus. She's just so impressed with your muscles. We've heard amazing things about you here. We have. MATT "Tell me, what have you heard?" We've heard that you know more about this town than anyone else. Yeah. I bet nobody knows more about the Greyspines than you do and they've been around a long time. No, I've heard they're terrible. What do you do, Balgus? (gasp) You do? The best brewery? This ale is amazing, that I'm drinking right now. Anyway! Whoa, you have a nine persuasion?! Oh really? Oh! How much for this exotic ale? We want to get in the door. We want him to like us. Tell you what, Balgus. We have some very rare items with us that I think you might be interested in. We've got one minute? Well, we've got-- We've got this with us right now. We've got this cup of dragon blood! Which I know can be added to ale or wine and makes it quite sensational. Exactly, a spoon of it! I think that's really expensive, actually. Shit, no. All right, fine! One cup of it. The troll dick. Is that still in there or no? Oh, okay. Ew. Can I stop Adra then and ask her where Greyspine Manor is? Keep, manor, whatever. Thank you so much. Oh, it's okay, we have a wonderful writer. Do we want to do the manor right now? What time is it? We might not want to bug him when he's, you know, having dinner. Well, it's only 600. What are you doing? I can't understand you with that popcorn in your mouth. All right. I think that you and I are going to go to Greyspine? Then no, we'll stealth our way. Pike's not listening, she's looking at the chat room. Oh, players. Lovely. You and I stealth. 30 gold?! Bearded ladies. Yes. No, we're going to try to check out what it looks like. See what the guards are like. Yes. Ew, no. (retching) How about we pose as brother and sister, creepy? (laughter) Yes. It's disgusting, so no. Oh shit, the Carvers. Shit. We could, but that could be bad. Let's say which ones are very obvious about being pretty, so we look like we're just sightseeing. I point and say Oh! Look at that one, with the carving, it's amazing! Divine! Oh my! Yes? (giggles) Oh I'm so sorry, I was just so amazed by the architecture here. I wanted to see the beautiful sculpture. We were told there was a beautiful sculpture down the street of the ruler of Kraghammer? 21. Oh no! I'm so sorry! Well, do we need protection? I thought Trinket stayed behind. Cool, cool! Oh no, please, he's quite harmless. In fact, he's very scared of most people. He does. Trinket show them your wonderful shake trick. That's good. If you put your hand out, he'll shake your hand. Yeah, see! Yes? Oh, good to know. Trinket, head back to that tavern, would you? People are getting nervous. I love you. He's so cute. All right. Thank you. Oh, this one's amazing. Wow, so you said the Greyspines own this one? Well, we can tell that can't we? Oh, really? Oh no! Wow. It sounds like they would run the mithral mine which we've heard is so hard on its employees. Oh, really? I don't blame you. Thank you so much. Make sure that they're paying attention to us. Then we stealth and-- This is so uncomfortable. He rolled a 20, I rolled a 15. No! They're professional Carvers. Of course! Oh, he already went back to the tavern that we're staying at. I was wondering if maybe you could show me around the rest of the town? Thank you so much. Yeah, go do your shit. Whoosh! Damn it! You got it, Tiberius! Can I use that magical earring that we have? Crazy! I have some hickies too, actually. What? Yes? No, we're in a room. Yes! Trinket! Isn't he adorable? I'll be right back. I head downstairs. Oh no! No, no! No! No. Grog! No, Balgus! Fuck! Trinket, come here! Are we allowed to cuss? Trinket, come here! Okay. No, no, and I run into the ring with him. Oh! I'll take on this bear! (laughter) Oh no! Let's do it! (gasp) You can do that? Little tiny. I don't know! Can you see in fog? What?! You have advantage, roll twice. Oh my gosh! I'm blindly looking for Trinket. What are you doing? Do some tricks! Do some tricks! Start clapping and, like, dancing around. Dance! Everyone! Gather round and watch the amazing Trinket do his tricks! Yes! I grab an empty cup off of the table and say Tips for the bear, right here! Can I take the mouse? Can I take Trinket? Okay, hi, Trinket! Oh, is his armor teeny tiny too? Well you're still adorable little-- don't poke him. I stick him in my little pocket. I laugh and hustle her over and say One, two, three, put them in a row for this gentleman right here. Don't fight him, you guys. How big is the room? Oh no. What will I do with Trinket? Well. Him! Trinket's a boy, all of you, please. You know, yeah. Can I go downstairs and ask about stables? Maybe he can stay in the stables. Trinket, is that okay? All right, yeah, he's seems to think it's all right. Let's go with the storage room. If there's anything that looks edible, you can eat it. It's fine. Just kidding! Oh, so he's fine. Shit. Oh, our comments cards, that's right. Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother, and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother, Vax'ildan, quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. Through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages. Definitely. Oh. Did you put a smiley face next to the A-F-A? That works. The Greyspine Manor, with our cask of fancy ale/wine.I feel really sleepy and also very awake at the same time. So what do you think? You're turning yourself into a dwarf? What kind of dwarf? What do you look like? Are you a girl dwarf? Trolls. Hi. I wave at Thompson. Oh. Where's Thompson? Oh, really? Yeah, we saw the statue, but we wanted to get a better look at it. We brought this gift for the Greyspines and we wanted to present it to them. It's really nice. A thimble of it because if any of it goes missing-- Is it sealed? Can we tell if it's sealed?. If we open it, it'll ruin the barrel, right? Maybe we can save you a bottle of it when we open it inside. We'll give it to you later. Should I roll that one that failed me earlier or my little dice? (high-pitched) My little, tiny dice. Teeny tiny dice. Okay that's better, I rolled a 23. We've got some bottles, don't worry. Yeah, keep nodding. Here's the thing. I don't know if I can save four bottles worth, but I'll save as much as I can. SAM and Hey, I've got it covered. Actually Nostoc. Oh, of course he is. Of course not. Of course. Of course not, but for the mining contracts, however, wouldn't we need to speak to Nostoc? Is there any way-- I hear it's very hard to get down into the mines. It's very well-guarded, right? That's why we came to speak to him here. Lovely. Thank you so much. (whispers) Maybe we should talk to Nostoc first. We're trying to get to the mines, essentially. Magrim, you've been wonderful. Thank you so much. We plan on keeping some of this ale and bringing it back to the household. Would you like some when we open the cask? Lovely. We'll be sure to save you a small bottle. You can do that?! I believe it is all of our business. 20 minutes, that's okay! Let's all step away from the house. Does he have an earring on? Does he have one of our earrings? Who all has an earring? Tiberius, tell him to look for paperwork of something. For the mines! Not everyone. You only made like five or something. You totally should! TRAVIS and We point at the ale and give him a thumbs up! Let's walk towards the guards. Can I use my perception to see which one of them looks maybe the most interested or weakest? Insight! Which one of them looks most interested in our party. Oh, good. I thought that was a one, but it's not. It was a 13. Which one looks like the newest? We brought this gift. Hello! We address all of them, maybe, right now, yes? I look over at the shaved-head one and I hold his gaze for a little bit. Pardon me. Not yet! Oh, yes, well-- we are here to speak with Nostoc. We brought a gift for him that's quite remarkable, actually. It exists. Yes. MATT "Signed by himself I see on the burned, emblazoned wood. I'll go talk to him!" He heads inside of the building, the doors close behind him. The other guards encroach, keeping a very keen eye, each one having a bead on the rest of your group. About two minutes pass before he comes back, opens the door and the dwarf goes, "Nostoc will see you briefly, but you best bring the gift. I think that's what's holding his interest." Oh, of course. Grog, if you would. Is it as amazing as we've heard? -- in the last few weeks. A halfling. Yes. You know what? We'll go after her. We'll bring her out. We'll get her out of your mines. Good! How much would this task be worth to you? Obviously we are doing you quite a favor and we brought you quite a gift! No, but I know she is probably wreaking havoc on your mines. Is that our business? Yes. Do we have permission to enter within the next few days? Obviously we might need to be prepared. Can I talk to good old Nostoc while he's doing that? Damn it. I am going to fall down. In front of Nostoc. I am going to fall down in front of Nostoc. Ow, oh my ankle! It hurts so very much. I lean down to one of the guards and say What is that bell for? Flushing, what does that mean? Like what? Oh, like what? We should attack them! I string my bow. I take a shot. I shoot it! 15. Wait! I didn't roll yet. 18. 18. What?! He is still? Well, I thought I brought him. I should have mentioned that. I'm sorry, I should have emphasized that more. Oh god. They're easy. Goblins are easy. Orcs are not. Ogres?! Oh, okay. Ugh! All of them? Oh! Well, all right. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the most damaged one. All right. Then I'm going to shoot Lightning Arrow. Yes, I do. All right, cool. I'm going to shoot Lightning Arrow at them. Okay! 21! All right. Then I do something else. 1d8. Right? Holy moly! So that's this. 13 for the arrow and then 4d8 for the spell. (counting) 17! Yes! Then the other one takes 2d8 if he fails his saving throw. Yes! Oh, he fails it so good. Two. ten. I can reassign my Hunter's Mark to him now? Yes. Oh, my Hunter's Mark! I didn't do my Hunter's Mark damage. But it doesn't matter. He's dead. All right, cool. 22. Yes! Oh, no. Double move?! He saved against it. We've practiced this, I turn. There are two goblins left? Keyleth, you are so hardcore. Oh, good call. I do the same thing on the other side. Yeah! We're stealthing, I'm stealthing. Oh yeah, Balgoos! Balgus. I know, some beautiful song for us! Wait, what for all of us? We all get a d8? What is it? Wait! I got a question! My Hunter's Mark, can I transfer it to that thing or do I have to-- Sweet! Did we roll initiative again? Oh! Me! Okay, I'm going to shoot-- oh god, I didn't realize I was going so fast. What? I rolled a 20 for stealth! Sweet! Okay. Trinket's going to hang out because I don't want to-- you know. I'm going to shoot Conjure Barrage. No, I'm just going to shoot him twice. All right. I am going to do the fire arrow thingy at it. The blazing bowstring. Thank you, Tiberius! Okay. 21? Oh wait, that's four plus seven is 11. 11. For the first one, plus for the blazing bowstring I can turn any arrow into a flaming arrow, doing additional ten fire damage. I'll roll that right now, which is this. Which is a seven! Then I'm going to roll again! That's a 24! Awesome. That's an eight. Seven plus seven is 14! Oh! I didn't do my Hunter's Mark. Thank you, chatroom! Six! Oh no! That's nothing! Six damage. Oh no! Is Keyleth unconscious? If you do a really good roll then you don't need it. No, you should've said that first. Four! That's just one dagger? 40 and then six on the other one. Kill him! 8d6?! Kill him! Lovely.
