Ugh, no, what is he doing to me? --from Origins Game Fair! Check out twitch.tv/DnDBeyond-- N, not &-- starting at 1200 pm Eastern time, to catch interviews, the monthly D&D Beyon-- What? Oh! You didn't plan a commercial at all this time. I can send a message to the Gentleman, so we don't have to go back. I keep wanting to use this spell that I have, but I haven't been able to do it yet. It's called Sending. Yeah, I can send a message. But it's one of my most powerful spells, you guys, so if we're going to fight somebody, I don't know if it's smart. It's like a piece of paper of the mind. Do you want me to do it? At the end of the day? Okay. Do we want to go find that troll guy? So we stay far away this time. No, you just throw it in the door. You don't have to walk in. I know. That's the thing, right? We'll send Frumpkin in first. It's on the way back, anyway. Fjord. I'll go next to Molly. Yeah, she can ride on my shoulders again. Is it a trap? Or is it organic? Nott, it could be a trap, come look and see if it's a trap. Can I follow the vines along and see where they're coming from? Yeah! Do it! Oh, no, it's one of those things again, just go around it! I throw little bits of moldy pastries at it because I feel sorry for it. Well, it's still really good. You know we're going to get lost in this swamp forever. Maybe we circled around for two hours the first time and we just didn't realize it. Those were the bone chimes! Should we be stealthy? Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us? LIAM and Yeah. Stay within 30 feet of me, okay? Nott! Bless you. Now you have advantage on stealth checks. Yeah. Let's do a semicircle around where the door is. Don't attack him up close. Don't let him get close to us. Yeah. Is this rough terrain, is this swampy or is this normal ground? Okay. Oh, that's-- Oh no. Oh no! Kiri, stay behind this tree next to me. No, behind it. Yeah. Who has the boomstick? Okay, be stealthy. You have advantage. You're going to see if the troll is inside-- What if the troll's not in there, though? Then we can go steal stuff. So find out if he's in there. Maybe he should go in there. Yeah. That's true. Okay, go in there, Nott. Do it. It has to be within 30 feet. So Caleb, you've got plus ten right now. Wait, can we all hold our attacks for as soon as the troll comes out of the tree? Okay. Well, sneak back here! Just use your thing! Don't you have, like, Burning Hands or something? Just light a finger on fire and just touch the thing. Yeah. You could run and do it. Oh, that's good. What? Why? Why do you want me to die? You're right, it will! Okay, I'm gonna follow 30 feet behind Nott as we're going up. (laughter) I'm going to get within 30 feet of Nott. And I'm within 30 feet of Nott. Sure, I guess? Oh, that's good, you still have advantage. Oh! And plus ten! But I-- Attack, attack, attack! That's only 2d6 of damage? Oh no! If you take so much more-- Okay. Seven. He can't; he's burned. Oh no! Can you not get within close range of him again? This is a surprise attack, though. That's me! I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon right above it! And it's going to hit him! It's not at disadvantage, because it's melee, right? Ooh! That's 1d8, because I did it wrong before. That's five plus seven. Eat it, troll! Then I am going to use my bonus action to ring a spiritual bell and Toll the Dead! Yes, that's what I mean! He's got to make a wisdom save of 15. Yeah! So that's 2d12! Ooh! 14! I'm going to stay right there. He's looking pretty rough. Ooh, he's so ugly! Don't laugh yet. Oh no! We can't attack him until you guys move. This is not about the gold, Fjord! This is a reckoning! Oh no. How far does it look like the pustules spray? Throw it at him! It's 15 feet away. Oh no! As far as you can. Get as far as you can! Roll better than Beau! From out of the flames comes the spiritual weapon from behind and it's going to come up and spank him on the butt. 14. Aw man. I pop out from behind the tree and say, "I was aiming for your butt." And then I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt at level three. Damn it, fuck, mother bitch. No, it doesn't hit. Did you guys see how powerful that was? Super powerful. I'm going to run away. I'm going to turn around and run the other direction. Yep, right there. No! Is he grappled? It slows him, I think! Oh, good. Wait, nobody hit it because Fjord's going to take serious damage! You'll keep taking damage. Good one, Molly! And he's poisoned, too, isn't he? What? Wait, are you awake then, Fjord? I'll walk up to Fjord. And I'll cast Cure Wounds at level one. I'll tap his head and be like Wake up already. Six points. Kiri, come out! Don't stab the corpse this time, it's poisonous. I did. Oh, thank god. Oh my god. Do you have Thunder Wave or anything that can push it back? Still do it. Just save your attack-- No. We all have our actions, so hold your attack 'cause I'll pull Fjord away. Wait until I can pull him away! Ahh! No! Wait, wait, wait! 30 feet? Go get the shinies before Nott. You won't. Whatever. Now you have used all your movement and you can't pull him away. Oh. Five points, if you get more than five points he's dead. Yeah! Whoa. That was really graphic! Oh, are you dead or something? Ugh. I go over and I use another-- --healing spell. Yay! I do Cure Wounds on him again. Stop doing this! Ooh. 11 points this time. I'm going to take my axe and I'm going to try to cut out his heart. Just in case. Very slowly, so it doesn't splatter. Okay. 12. I don't want to touch it. I'm going to use my fabric and try to get it out, like a cloth or something. Ah! Does anybody have anything glass or metal? Put it in there! Why? It squirted poison! We can keep it! I'm going to sit on the ground. I'm going to look through my stuff, see if I have anything that can hold it. Does his body have a pouch on him at all? Can I search the body? 13. Hey, Nott, I found some pickled muscle for you. The slimy kind. Man, my medicine checks are sucking. Ten. It's probably human. I'm going to take the hide he had covering his junk, and wrap it around the heart, because obviously it can take being splattered by venom. I don't want the dong. Sit by the skulls! It's cozy over here. Whoa, you pass out the 26 gold? I guess we should go home, huh? I mean, back to the town. Don't stab the troll, it's poisonous! It will hurt you. I think we're a bad influence on her. No. Don't eat human, Kiri. Don't stab humans and don't eat humans, okay? Do what you have to. Are you okay, Fjord? You died twice. Oh that's true, three whole times! I poke his stomach. Does it feel like there's a hard thing in there? Can't feel anything past the steel. Yeah, we should probably do that. He gets weird when he kills people when he burns them. He did it before. I don't know if Kiri would. She'd probably be cool with it. Let's start walking! We did it! Yeah, we were in the bad part of town. We can go to the nice part of town. I'm going to cast Sending. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to cast Sending and send a message to The Gentleman. I'm going to say Hey, Mr. Gentleman. We found your safe house. We cleared it out of a bunch of fish people. Don't worry, everything's fine now, okay. We also found a troll in the swamp, we killed that too, and we also found some crocodiles. Please respond to this. If you need anything let us know, okay? And your agent out here, the guy with the no teeth, is dead. He interrupted me while I was telling him what we did. Yeah, there was so much more, but I think he got the idea. We'll get the bonus. Yeah, he seemed like he was doing pretty good when we saw him. You know what, it might be, because I think they decided to charge other people with the crimes and stuff. Were they still, though? Are they? I don't remember. Horris, do you have a lot of diamonds on you? Maybe some that are worth 300 gold? I'm on the lookout, okay. Poisonous troll hearts! Man, I'm glad he's alive. I thought he was one of the dead bodies we found at the safe house. He went in the apothecary! And I take off running. I have a troll heart. It's full of poison. Do I roll with advantage because Molly is helping? 22! We killed a troll. Do you want to see it? I open the leather and place it down. (squishy noise) Hey! There are a lot of aortas and chambers and stuff. Probably you could buy it and also give us some stuff. Really strong ones? Is that regular? Or stronger than that? But I'm more interested in the healing potions. Take the troll-- what's your name by the way? Smithe Durban. No! Nope! I'm taking it with me. What a nice guy. I did. I liked him a lot. Thanks, Fjord. I saved his life multiple times today. Yeah. I mean he's not that cool or anything! I mean you probably wouldn't be interested in him at all. Do you have any ginger ale, or fresh milk? She's the sweetest, isn't she? She's wearing a mask, she's not really a bird! And I take her. Oh! That's surprising, 20. (whispers) It's Tusk Love. That's definitely Tusk Love. Sounds good. It opens at sunrise so we should be good. Yeah, they're at the docks or something. He dropped them off at the place-- The central stables, we have to ask where they are. We don't have to go back to the other pub. Don't worry, Fjord. Kids, huh? They're always wandering off. They look like a troll took a shit in them. She doesn't like us very much. Does it look like a T, with a U, with an S, with a K. With an L-- You got this, Yasha! I have a book you can read, Yasha. I feel like we only need three rooms. Wait, before I go to sleep, I want to use my Pearl of Power and regain a 3rd-level spell, and I want to cast Sending on my Mama. And I'm going to say Hi, Mom! I got a new spell. I want to say thank you for the package you sent me. I know that it was really hard for you to do that and I love you so much and I hope everything's okay with you, and I got your letter and the ink and I think it's so-- Oh no, can I respond to it? Oh no! Okay, I need to tell her I got her package. Whoa! We have to go to that shop, Molly. You have to pay her to do it too. I write a valet ticket really fast. Here you go! That's-- Yep. I do. But you might have to go-- We are! I'm going to! Why not? Oh, man. We can't just let her go! What if I try to get a hold of her parents or something? We can't just-- what are we going to do? Just send her on her way by herself? Okay. She could be like her own Gentleman. (gasps) I hope so. Maybe I can talk to her and have her write down exactly what her parents look like or something and I can try to send a message to them? They're birds. Right here. What's the gold stuff in there? What's the stuff that swirled around when you put it on the table? What is that? What else? I think that sounds like a pretty cool deal. Wait, no. Beau, no. He's paying us. They help you-- sometimes guys have problems with the (tongue click) and then there's potions that can help with that. My mom said. I'm going to look around the store. Before we leave, or as we're leaving the store, I want to say Molly, stay inside for a little bit, okay? And keep talking to the guy, okay? For just a minute. I'm going to use my paint, and I'm going to change the sign to "The Fungal Fart." (laughter) Ooh. 20! I can heal that. Hey, you've got our stuff! That's not surprising. Yeza? Was he the halfling guy? Aw. While everyone's figuring it out-- Hupperdook! So we'd pass by Hupperdook. But Rexxentrum is the capital. We should probably stay clear and go to Hupperdook. That Trent guy? Tell you what, we'll go Hupperdook on the way up, and then we can do Rexxentrum on the way back. Gnome parties. And they live in mushroom houses. Insight check! 13. That's amazing. We have a carriage, let's stay on the roads. Like a flea market town. It's an outlet, outside of town. I bet I can get 300 gold worth of diamonds for way less. Which, by the way, I want to talk to you guys. Here's the thing; this spell that I have takes diamonds, in order to bring you back to life. I don't have enough gold to buy all these diamonds for everybody, so-- Well, yeah. Or if you want to be selfish about it, you can buy your own diamonds and then I'll use those for you. Doesn't matter, it's just 300 gold worth of diamonds, but they're going to be gone if you die. You keep your diamonds on you. Yeah! No! You have your own diamond pocket and then when I save you, it'll be like-- Sounds good to me. We just pop out the diamonds! We can still keep ruby jewelry and emerald jewelry-- Just diamonds. What's that about? How come he gets to keep his? Well, maybe he can fly, I don't know! Sometimes he's invisible, could it be he's flying next to me? I don't know! Could we maybe keep the diamonds? While we're going, I need to sit next to Kiri, and I'm going to pull out my sketchbook, and I'm going to ask her to write down everything she can think of about her mom and dad, and draw a little picture of them, because I'm going to try to do Sending for her mom and dad. That's about how I pictured them. So they were going the opposite direction that we are. That sucks. I take a little paintbrush and I draw a smiley face on the rock. They're not dead! I like how this is like Final Fantasy traveling. Let's roll individual ones. Oh, 17. That would be funny. Pineapple! If you got a thicker cloak, it would look real good with it. Do you buy stuff as well, or do you only sell stuff? I've got a gator skin. Super fresh! We should probably tan this. I leave the tent. Are we trying to do a covered wagon? No, keep saying it, maybe he'll start rolling better. I'm heading back to the cart, spreading out the leather hides, and making them dry out. No it's not, it's a ballerina. Wait! Should I have asked if Kiri was cold? Do you get cold, Kiri? Do you get cold? Yes? Or No? You get cold. Oh, I run back in and try to get some warm clothes for Kiri. Something really pretty though. Okay. Can we see? That was impressive. 15. Do they look like fancy wagons? Maybe we should ask. Have you been to Hupperdook? Did you see the mushroom houses? Damn it. No. (shouts) Where are you going? Are you safe? I look at one of the kids. (whispers) Are you safe? Are you good? Are you safe? I don't know. I feel like they would've said if they were in danger or something. Yeah. I'm afraid it's like... I don't know, I just feel like somebody's not safe there. Okay. Okay. Ask what's happening at their home! Nogvurot. Oh, that's where the people have been getting stolen from! People are getting stolen, remember? Oh, okay, so we can sort of avoid-- We should avoid Nogvurot right now. After we've already taken care of the stuff so we get paid. Do we know how much time we have left before our time is up with the Gentleman's timeline? And we have a month. Okay. This is going to be the hard stuff now. Her eyes are like the sea. (laughs) Natural 20! I'm going to Invoke Duplicity. And I'm going to send her out next to Molly. Do you guys have healing potions, because you just sent a lot of arrows at Nott. I mean at this-- I mean-- You know the drill. Take off your pants and walk away. I rolled a one. No pants for me. They said they wouldn't be bandits anymore, but they are bandits. Yeah, don't go working for criminals! That's stupid! Oh. Then if you're going to do bad things, at least work for somebody who's rich and doing bad things! Don't just steal from people on the road, that's stupid! Only steal from grumpy people! You're going to steal his money and he's got medical problems. Do I have to heal him now? Don't kill this corpse! Don't stab this corpse! I know, but she'll think it is. No way! That's so terrible! I got pants! I'm going to add it because I think I already have some bandit pants. He knows where their hideout is, he's fine. He'll be fine, he's a bandit. What if we put some flowers in his hair, so when he wakes up, he looks really pretty? There's blankets. We can take the blankets. Molly, they have a covered wagon! Or we can take theirs and leave ours. We should take the grain for our horses. This is not how I pictured it. Is it mostly gnomes that live in the city? Does it look like the buildings are teeny? 13. (quietly) We should be going to the city. I guess we'll ride into the city. Blushing Tankard tavern. Alliteration. Hold the elevator. It will be fun. We are guests here. That's what we are. We're guests of Hupperdook. Hupperdook. Yes. That one. Oh, man. Come on, I really want to be on it! Come on, man. Let us get on, man. It was a firecracker, that's all. Well, we could have, if this guy, he would have listened to us, because we are really important people. We're the Mighty Nein. We thought the name was funny. We might as well be wearing fanny packs. All of us. Like an amazing fanny haversack? I'm going to keep an eye on her, because I think she's going to try to steal some of our stuff. Beau, you make really bad first impressions, too. She's basically you. Are you saying you are crazy? I mean, you did that in front of everybody. Are we having an agreement? Oh. I can see that about you. Is it sooty up here too? Do you live on a high floor or a low floor? Less stairs. Do you build the machines down there? This is a party town!
