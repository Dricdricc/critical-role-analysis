Can you see him, is he there? My brother. I can't see you, you're hiding in the shadows. I can, yes. What? You're crazy! Yes, yes. See, that's exactly what I was asking Travis. Is like in a few hours. Oh, really? Is it ending tomorrow night, or is it ending tonight? I'm scared it's actually ending tonight. He thinks it's tomorrow night, but I think it might be tonight. It's probably tomorrow night. He's going to murder us all, very shortly. All these overlapping things happening? And we've got our Critical Role logo on the back. So cool. They're soft, they feel very nice on your body. But yeah, those will be up as well for a week for pre-order, so yeah, check those out. Get whatever shirts you can. And I think there's a limited amount available for purchase right away, so if you order fast, you might be able to get them. But that's a very small amount. And also, to everybody that's been messaging us on Twitter, there have been some people that have really been wanting us to expand our sizing and we are definitely working on that. It's hard to find some vendors that can accommodate us, but we're working on it, so hopefully moving forward in the future, we'll have larger sizes available to everyone. Critrole! Critrole! By the way, I have some of Liam's dice in front of me. Maybe my brother should hang onto his things. That's a wonderful announcement. We already rested, though? What do you think, Keyleth? I mean, it's your family. I'm rather winded, actually. Is Gern completely out of the picture, have we lost sight of him? You said that so weird. Like how, what do you mean? Are you going to poop us a bed? I know, are we just going to watch you diddle yourself? Let's have it. What? Is this a teleport sort of-- Is it that fire plane where we just-- there's no dragons in that plane? What? Wait, could you technically do this with any refugees? I mean, where do they go when you make the door go away? Like, attractive? They're all hot. So terrible. Why the fuck not? And I walk on through. What the fuck. No! Wait, do you pay them or do they just work for you? This is terrible. Scanlan! Are you sure? Have you asked them? Your purpose, do you enjoy your purpose? Wow. Do you tip them? I believe you. What in the fuck is this place? How are you doing this? So wait, you built this entire castle, so how do we know that you haven't installed creepy spy things into our rooms, Scanlan? I don't trust you. That is terrible, it's a terrible path you're going down right now, I am uncomfortable with this-- So uncomfortable right now. Scanlan, where are we staying? Where's our rooms? For? That's really sweet. It's super-duper weird. It's really weird. Is the door protected? Can anybody come in, or is it only if you invite them? This is the best fucking mansion ever. How-- I mean-- what? (gasps) No, but they could run away, it's not like time freezes. I pull out my crystal and I call upon the great power of Trinket. I choose you. We have a mansion! You built a Trinket room. That's okay, he'll stay in Kaylie's room for the time being, and then-- Pike loves him, I bet he wouldn't mind-- Do you have any rooms with very high ceilings? The very front? But I mean somewhere I could put a bed for myself and Trinket with very high ceilings. Wonderful. I'll move my bed down there. That'll be perfect. Trinket needs to train. All right. Totally. I understand. No, we're killing cows, we're killing, we're killing poor servants-- That's so dark! Grog! Stop it! Look, you're hurting it! Trinket blocks it. No, Grog, actually, I think you should train for a little bit at least. Just come down to the basement and maybe train for a little bit. I go down to the training room. And I stop the servant and go, can you bring down a bed for me? Thank you. Grog, can we train, please? Yes, I think I need to train with you, specifically. The minute we get downstairs, I start pawing into the Bag of Holding. I just need to (grunts). (a phone dings) Oh, just this cleaning utensil, is all. Are we by ourselves? Nobody else came down, right? Yeah, I just wanted to do some cleaning with this broom that I-- I put it in the Bag of Holding before. Maybe you can train over there on those dummies, and I can just sweep up some of this sand that's around in this area right here. Yes. Well, Trinket actually wanted some training with his cannonball. If you will stand still so he can run into you a few times, that would be swell. It's fun, right? Go ahead and try, Trinket! Oh, God, you're really doing it. Yes, that's the point of this, to get Trinket to run into you is the point. His attack bonus is plus eight. And you're knocked prone! While all that is going on, I have a broom in my hand. I put it between my legs and try to sit on it. And I jump in the air a little bit. Okay. I say, up! Fly! Lift up! Fatty Arbuckle! Shenanigans! Ren and Stimpy, I don't know. Fuck! Grog. (Irish accent) Fatty Arbuckle! (laughter) (groans) I put the broom on the ground. I walk over and I punch Grog as hard as I can. It's not. I'm pretty fucking weak. Sorry I hurt you, Grog, I know that was a very strong punch. Are you guys good? Do you want to keep training? Nothing! I put the fucking broom back in the Bag of Holding. I figured the servants can do it. I walk upstairs. I go find Keyleth. Hey! Actually-- no, I don't want to talk to you. Keyleth. What do you know about magical things? Like a lot? Oh, fuck. Thank you so much! Scanlan! I might need to talk to you, dear. Why, yes, we should. I go get the broom from the Bag of Holding again. I follow him up and knock on the door. Wow. Well, darling. I shut the door behind me. I have a favor to ask you. It's nice mood setting, I like it. You're so smart. I've always thought that about you, that you're very smart. Yes. I sit down next to him on the bed. Cozy. Help me! What? Maybe. Okay, Scanlan, I'm a terrible person, I know. I took a broom from a poor, poor dragonborn. Maybe. I know, I'm sorry, I know, I'm terrible, and now it won't work and it was pointless and I want it to work. Help me. Because it flies, Scanlan. I don't know, there's just something about being up there in the air that makes me feel alive in a way that I've never felt before. Okay. Wait-- Oh, you mean. With your cube. I'd rather you do it with this broom, actually. And not in any weird way, just to be able to help me make the broom fly. Do you know how to do that? Oh, no! I speak Elvish, Draconic, Undercommon? But you saw it. Well, I tried Fatty Arbuckle. I thought maybe that was something. Coral. Carol. What was the... Oh. Coral! Carol! I don't remember the other one's name. Stimpy? Was it Stimpy? It was Stimpy! Wait, but what does the word say? Where's the word? Can I find it? What is it? What is it? What does it say? That's smart. (hacking spit) (singing) Something has changed within me! Oh my God! Oh my God. Scanlan. I hug him. I hug him as hard as I've ever hugged Scanlan. I love you so much. You're my favorite person in the entire universe right now. I owe you-- I love you. I sit on it. How high are the ceilings in here? Can I sit side-saddle on it? (hacking spit) I don't remember how I said it before. Why didn't I choose something more fun to say? Yay, this is awesome! I'm really high! Oh my gosh! Can I take my hands off? Oh my God. I probably should have been lower to the ground when I said that. Okay, that's fine. Oh, I'm still exhausted! 20. Can I point it down towards the ground and get lower? Oh. My. God. This is the best day of my entire life. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I know, I know, it's terrible! How bad of a person am I? I'm a horrible person! Well, I tried. I was going to give him a lot of dragon scales, and he wandered away! Well, how do I help him? Because I feel terrible. I will help as many people as I can while I'm flying through the air. I think that's a deal, Scanlan. What are you, like, a hag now? I sit on it, and I open the door, and I fly through the doorway. I'm so happy! It's the best! I'm going to try to sleep. It's going to be really, really hard because I'm so excited, but I really need to get some rest! (whispering) It's the green one. I come skipping into the room, for sure. What a beautiful day it is! Oh, that is so sad. Can you heal it? Can it be healed? Wait, Scanlan, can we store things here, or does it all disappear as soon as we leave? We should leave something inconsequential. No. No, no, no, let's not. Thank you, Scanlan, for making me feel... So, guess what! I can fly! A-plus! Did you have a weird night? Do you want to tell us about it? Okay. So I sort of kind of tricked Gern, I'm a terrible person. I sort of kind of, this is the worst... took something that wasn't mine? In a way. I mean, I was holding on to it, and then I slipped, and it fell into the Bag of Holding. I stole from a necromancer. Yes. No, he was a nice guy. We did. We took it, Scanlan, and we didn't tell Allura. We're terrible. I know. I know, I'm afraid these rogue tendencies I've been learning from you, brother, maybe rubbed off a little bit. No, I just, I know I shouldn't have. I wanted to return it right away, and then he wandered off. That's a lie, I didn't want to return it. But I did want to pay him! No, I did! I did, I wanted to pay him! But he wandered away, and then I didn't pay him, and now I have this broom that I stole, and there's really no way to return it. Well, I probably could find him, but I don't want to because now I can fly, you guys. No. I'm going to keep it. Actually, Percy, do you know-- I know you can build things and make things wonderful. I pull out the broom and I lift up in the air. No, I've been practicing! I've been practicing! No, no, no, look! I'm not holding on, Percy! Look at me, not holding on! Okay. Shut up! 13. Oh, man, disadvantage. Okay. 16. Oh, shit. Oh, god, okay. Okay. Shit balls. 13. Mother bitch, I really need to work on this! Okay. Yes, Percy, this is the thing. Can you build a seat on this? What if you could build a seat, and then I can sit on it instead of trying to sit on this tiny little stick? Really? How's that mimosa treating you? Oh, no, are you already drunk, Keyleth? I float down. I float down eye-level, but I'm still floating. Why are you trying to be an asshole? Here's the thing, Keyleth. I'm not afraid to die anymore. I came to this realization. I've seen the other side. I've come to terms with it. It's pretty wonderful. That's right. I'm not going to steal anything while I'm riding on it. I'll practice as much as I can, and Percy's going to help me. So I can be stable on this thing. I will give you all the money you want. Maybe. But I feel so good. I start eating while sitting on the broom. Where should we head to? Did you want to head back to-- Actually, Keyleth, you said something weird happened last night for you as well. Yeah? I look at my brother. All right, cool. Keep going. That's one of the dragons. What do you mean? They adopted a dragon? How? So she was making it seem like she was 15. Oh, eventually. Right. Totally. That day. The day. Okay, well that's good to know. Got it. Do you guys have vegetables, maybe? Any vegetables? Cool. Chicken and mimosas, it's my favorite breakfast. Little? Where are we going next, you guys? We need to talk to a sphinx. A sphinx's boyfriend. That's with your tribe. So do you want to go now, or do you want to maybe swing by somewhere? We'll remember. Well, it's all actually around Westruun, right? Aren't your people around Westruun? So we have to find them. Last time we ran into them, wasn't it on the way to Kraghammer? I think it was. The Frostweald is-- South of Westruun, yes. Potentially? Well, Grog would know. Cool. Yes, I think Grog really wants to go. Yeah. Around there. Okay. Oh, weren't you-- And? Oh. The Hat of Disguise? Very big. The wolf? Oh, the wolf in Whitestone? Well, Trinket can smell. Six? Okay. Oh. I hold up mine, too. How many hands is that? Steal from the goliaths? That could work. Does he wear them all the time? Does he put them in a chest? Yeah. You're right. If six is the right number. As a hat. No, he has locations of other vestiges. I feel like Pike would want to come with us, Grog. You're very dear to her. You know of trees outside of Westruun? And Gatshadow is where Grog got his scar, right? Allura, I think, handled that, right? You saw her. Yes, we have been to the Frostweald. Frostweald is where Grog mugged down with the nymph, right? Allegedly. Yes, you do. Let's do it! I mean, we could try. Westruun's under dragon rule. There's an actual dragon on Westruun. Let's do it! Let's do it! Let's do it! Yeah. Oh shit. Go to the forest. No, this is great! Ugh. No, we are, we're super fast. I pop Trinket back into his little crystal. Percy, what if instead of a seat, what if it was like I was straddling it, and there were two little things like footholds? No, no, it's up to you. It's totally you. I was just coming up with ideas to help you out. No, no, it's all you. It's all you. Can we mist down a little closer to get a better view of what it is? Wow. No, 16 for me. Oh, this is where they make their offerings. That's good to know. I have advantage on anything having to do with dragons. It's good to know that that's there, though. Yeah! Perception. 31. They've imprisoned the people. We can't talk to each other. I don't know what good we'll do right now. I mean, how many guards are there around there? What do you want to do? What do you want? I noticed it too. Oh, shit. Can we stealth? As we come out of it, I want to cast Pass Without a Trace immediately. Can we go down in an area that there's shadow, to where we're hidden? Somewhere that when we take form, we'll be hidden. I don't know. And I cast Pass Without a Trace, so it's extra ten. 32. Add ten! 32. We just want to sit here for a minute and talk about it. Can we just say, so here's the thing. Those guards are attacking the farmers. I'm pretty sure they're using slave labor at this point. Kind of like you, Scanlan! Slave labor to provide food for the city. Vax really wanted to stop down, but the thing is, if we kill the guards and set the farmers free, everybody in the city might starve. It's a tough situation right now. I'm afraid right now I don't know what all we can do in this town until we can defeat the dragon, which unfortunately is rather close. I mean, we can tell him to hold out hope. He could also be one of the assholes that's serving the dragon, just like people in Emon. Act natural! Keep picking! Hey, you. Do you like the dragon or do you not like the dragon? Do you like the dragon or do you not like the dragon? Good. What's the worst? Right. So you have to provide food for everybody living in the city? Is that how that goes? Well, here's the thing. We're trying to help you. We're trying to find a way to (clicking) (choking) kill the fucks. You get me? Ill-kay the agons-dray. Act natural! Keep picking, keep picking, keep picking! We want to help you. We really, really, really want to help you. Oh, shit. The guards? They're keeping your daughter? Keep your voice down! They, the guards? The people that serve the dragon? To keep him working! There's a dragon! Farmer. What's your name? Reginald. Reginald, we want to help. How often do you see the dragon flying around? Once every couple days. When was the last time you saw him? (gasps) What do they look like? Shit. Scanlan! Green and a black. I feel like we have to help them. We have to help them! I'm keeping an eye out for the guard. I want to keep an eye out for the guard, make sure he's not noticing. 17. Well, I saw him on the other side of the thingie. I have an idea! Can I give my idea? What if we ask Reginald to call for help, like he needs this fuck's help, and then he comes over, and then we spring a trap on him. I can use Hide in Plain Sight on us, and hide us, and make us look like we're part of the crops. To set an ambush. The other guard? Yeah? Can I take a minute to camouflage us and then tell Reginald to call him over? Got it. Reginald. Act like you're still picking and act like you hurt your ankle, and call for help from that guard over there. We'll protect you. Just step back and call for help. The minute he's in the high crops so he's out of visual from the other guard. Shit, mother bitch! That's a bit obvious. Okay. I was picturing all the plants suddenly losing their shit. Festivities? And we gained another plus ten, so now we have plus 20 to all of our stealth, by the way, from that Hide in Plain Sight. We have Pass Without a Trace, which adds plus ten, Hide in Plain Sight adds plus ten. That's what I camouflaged us fucking for. 46. (whispering) I notch an arrow. Grog! Oh shit. Good job, there. What the fuck is that sword, Grog? What is your sword doing? It takes in the blood? Grog. The little dude. Your little friend? You killed him. On purpose? You wanted to? Could we wait until nightfall? Well, as soon as we move, we won't be camouflaged in this crop anymore. We'll lose that. Keyleth, can you use your powers to suck him into the ground so that nobody sees him? I use my abilities and try to camouflage the body so that nobody finds him. Reggie? The other guard, yeah? Right now? They can't hurt us when we're mist. See what we see. Can we stealth while we're misting? Let's try that, so we can spy on the city! Get closer in. Why? At least if we go in, Grog, we can see what we're up against. It's not cowardly, Grog, it's safe. All right. All right. Can we stealthily head towards a pocket of people? Do we see a crowd of people being held? This is my mist form. Stealth checks! Yes! 39. And the spikes are facing inward towards the city, or outward? Can we see Wilhand anywhere? What about the mayor's house where we heard Horace--? Can we see Kevdak anywhere? I look for a bigger goliath than the rest, or one that looks older and bigger. 16. We don't see a cluster of prisoners anywhere out in the open? Yeah! Do we see a cluster? A cluster of prisoners out in the open at all, or is it just out around--? Can we say go back to the-- Yeah, let's go back. 39. No. Ooh! Is it Reggie? No! Ugh! That's us. Totally boring? You know, not a lot to see there. There's a lot of goliaths and a lot of other bad guys walking around, oppressing very nice-looking people. It looks like if we barged in, straight in, they'd probably have very good fortifications. They really want to look scary. So, here's the thing. Do we barge in, totally risk our lives? Or try to find a way around this situation? It's where the mayor lived before. Yeah, it's like a big house. TALIESIN and I wonder if Kevdak goes to the sacrificial area where they leave the hoard for the dragon. As long as someone is. Or is it a walk in and try to challenge him? No! You're not going to fall, Grog. We wait. You want to go in there with Pike? We wait for Pike. We wait until Gilmore's up and standing and we bring Pike here with us. For what? They never met her. Is Reginald still around? Hi, Reggie! So we're going to help you. You might have to wait a little while. We most definitely are. Spread the word that hope is alive. We will find a way to beat this. Don't tell anyone what you saw here, though, right? That's a good answer. Man, Grog! I like it! I want Pike here, too. You could totally have taken them. Seems appropriate. Good call! She's little!
