Oh no! No, you are not doing that right now! Wow! That made me sweat. Merch stuff coming up? Yeah, preorders for the hoodies are still going on, aren't they? How about that, guys? They're still happening. You can still order those for I think a whole other week. No? Am I wrong? I'm stroking out so hard. For another week! We don't know what we're doing yet. In addition, though, to Batman The Telltale Series, Gears of War is launching on the 11th. We just did a big live event yesterday. Gears of War 4. If you got the Ultimate Edition, you can download it and you can play it early. As in, tonight. Which, you shouldn't do. You should be watching us. But you could do it after you're done watching us. Your trailer looks so good! That's as far it gets right now. Are those real games? Register to vote! You've still got some time. That's it? We're just supposed to trust you? Keyleth? What's their plan? What's your illness? So you come before us and you tell us you're weak? Well, obviously, but I don't believe anything she says. Is he still insane? We've seen this before. Can you talk him into flying off, leaving everyone alone? So dead, then. Ditto! Oh, that was terrible! Ugh, 13. Well, yeah, sure she does. She. Have you been here as Asum this whole time? What have you been doing? What do you do, sleep in his room like a halfling? If you tell us what the disease is-- Have you tried Greater Restoration? (laughter) How long do we have? You've been checking in from where? Here? Does he know where you are? So when Vorugal flew over... did he not sense you? Was he seeking you, or was he seeking Whitestone? We won't have much time to talk after the destruction of the white dragon. More deaths do not make it right, Keyleth. A chance to take down Thordak. You said yourself you can't do it on your own. You've been down there? Then why didn't we meet down there? Why are you so scared of it? Have you done anything with the rest of our friends? Yeah, we already covered that. The old war room, because we moved the new one down into the ziggurat and she didn't respect that! Are you going to attack her all of a sudden? Are you going to attack her right now? Why? That's very important. I know, okay! Because we're really smart and we totally-- That's right. How long until that happens? No. Is Melora an enemy of Vecna? Do we know that? Makes sense. So what good are you? What can you do? I have an idea with that. If we're in this together, can I say it in front of her? Preferably one that doesn't rely on hate as a message. What? We haven't kept an eye on her the whole time. You're giving her ideas right now, aren't you? Natural 20! Yes. Don't actually look at Vorugal, look at something near Vorugal. I don't think so, either. She'll know. I sit on the table. What's going on? You did well, dear. I feel like she needs to talk to the spirit because she's going to try to absorb his power or something. We never mentioned J'mon Sa Ord when we got back, so Asum does not know about that, or Raishan doesn't know about that. Do we have no way of having knowledge of when someone scries on us? They can do it. So you would know. She would know if someone was trying to scry on us. Two? Speaking of Vestige, this is part of the plan. So? (gasps) The Spire of Conflux. That's why we've heard of her! Shit! It's resting in the belly of a terrible beast in the Abyss, right? So. Gate scroll. What if we bring it through, let it fight Vorugal, kill Vorugal, get the staff-- Not like anything could go wrong with it but-- Yenk. Can Pike-- Pike, have you ever heard of a goristro named Yenk? Nothing? It's a fiend in the Abyss. Anything about a goristro? At least you know how to pronounce it. Where is Allura? We haven't seen her in forever. She's out-- Just now? Yeah, can we go in the library and look in the books there? Is there somebody religious, outside of Pike, in the city? Oh yeah, ask Kash! Oh yeah, you do have a shrine, after all. Investigation? Oh! No, this has nothing to do with dragons. Ten. Did you get a 20? Does it still count as a 20? Did you find it? That's enormous. I hope the dragon kills it. Well, that's helpful. We kill them. No problem. Anyway! And I leave. We should probably show everybody what we found. No, you first-- Yeah. You can do it! "Is it Thursday yet?" Did you almost say "Is it Thursday yet?" [break] Okay? Oh. It only lasts for how long? The venomous tea. All right, yeah. It'll last for 24 hours. We'll keep it. (gasps) That's true! Let's make some and put it a flask, and then we'll do it later. Just to have some poison in general. Not necessarily for Raishan. Poison. I don't think this is for Raishan! I knew you didn't think it was for Raishan. Six ammo. (laughs) Don't even encourage that-- Just don't. Wow. Yeah, I want to go find Vax and Keyleth, as well. Oh, me? You want to find me? Hi, what's up? Oh, you saw them? Okay, yes? Thank you so much, Grog. I'll remember that. All right. Thank you so much. It's important. Hey, did you find anything? Yes? Okay. Which one? Okay. Everything we need, we saw on the way to the sphinx. Well, it's here-- No. But there was a ziggurat, as well. We went down a cavern, and there was a name. Right, and she worshipped the goddess of knowledge. So maybe we need to talk to Ioun, no? Maybe we just talk to a god. That's impossible unless you're-- Worthless, really. Yeah. That's a nice cloak you have there, Keyleth. This is true. It looks lovely, though, stacked next to the rest of my clothing. Do you want it back? He only gives cloaks to those he really cares about, Keyleth. Really cares about. Well, it's one of Yenk's brethren. Well, obviously Keyleth's there, so I figured I was, too! Do we even know how to use the Gate scroll exactly? Scanlan has to use it, right? Oh, that's the goristro. Well, one is called a snake lady. A marilith. I think it's just the one guy. Hopefully, other things can't come through. Can they? Read that scroll again, Scanlan. It doesn't bring other things through? Doesn't leave the gate open? So other things could come through. We will have Raishan with us. No, we wouldn't. Raishan will be in disguise. Oh, they could be at the castle? What time is it? Whatever relevance that has. Right. Important day, is that? We get her over there, and then we kill her afterward. She was going to be another magic user, dressed as a human, or something. Yeah, but a little cave. A cave that Asum would fit in. She can sense lies. Can I go find Zahra? That's my necklace. When we're not in the city. He's out of the necklace. Yes, he's always around. I'm also gone. Knock-knock? Zahra? How are you? How are things? I never noticed the drool, don't worry. Anything interesting? Speaking of, you've been very busy, I know, with all of your research, but do you remember what we spoke of before we left? Arrows of dragon-slaying? Okay, that's wonderful! One is better than none. Wonderful! This is costly, what do I owe you? I hope this isn't a lot. But she made it, so that's not how much it would be, right? Zahra said it wasn't that much before. Oh. Okay. But that's 30,000 gold pieces? Jesus. Man. I'll wait. You keep making this awesome. (dryly) No. I know you're so busy. Mark it back down to one in my-- Zahra, you're amazing. We're going into battle pretty soon. These fuckers are pretty dangerous, so I'm concerned. Keep doing what you're doing. If you find the time-- Thank you, Zahra. I deserved that! Mary said it was only five, okay. I just wandered back. I'm done talking to Zahra. Hey. The door's open. We stay clear. Once we pull it through, how do we keep it in place long enough for-- How do we get in front of-- How is she? Her and Gilmore both. Well, something you might enjoy, actually. Feel like killing a dragon? No! No. Shit. I totally did that, didn't I? But she wanted to come! And fight the dragon. I'm an idiot. And they get destroyed! I feel like I got us into this, and I'm really sorry about that. What are we voting on? You're abstaining? Oh shit! If she finds out, she is going to be really super pissed. I feel like she should come. Let's do it. Tree Stride. Yeah, that's true. It's only ten minutes now. It's only ten fucking minutes. He's gone. No, I think you're doing it wrong. Scanlan-- No, we don't. Pure stupidity. She'll fuck up Whitestone. It'll give us away. We have to get away from the city. I'm keeping an eye on the time. It's in Draconia. It's hiding. What if you go running off? What if you go try to kill it in here, and Whitestone gets destroyed? It's a temptation. Believe me, we know. Well we trusted her. Here's the thing, though you have to pretend like you don't know. It's super important. Well. Pretend. Okay. Perfect. And don't attack. No. He can choose any ten minutes he wants, really. We go. If we're totally weak, though, we can't fight the second dragon right away, we have to save up our strength and then fight her after so we don't die. Don't talk to anyone, Kima. Yeah, that's why Percy left. I'm going to-- well, if we have time. I'm going to attune my cold-snap armor to me, so I'll probably not have my bracers attuned. But I get, what, cold resistance and added AC, or something? Oh no. Well, it's Asum right now. Yeah. You're holding the roots. Today I talked to the Sun Tree. He's saying that as you're holding on to his roots. Sorry. Has anybody seen Keyleth? Oh. Did you have fun? And sap. Yeah. Well, he deserved it. How about we get through the tree before we talk anymore? Yeah. We're popping in far enough away, right? In the tree grove up above the chasm? Can you set us up? What's my armor class now that I've put the cold-snap armor on? I did, so is it up two points from that? Kima, there's extra rooms upstairs. But it uses one of your spells? Is that all right? I mean, it's pretty important. Who? What? She was. Vorugal's a male. Scry on Tooma. I'll sit in the door, and I'll keep an eye on this. Natural 20. 33. I think that's dangerous. Both. Anything near Vorugal, I feel like it's dangerous. Plus, Thordak has those scrying balls within the location. I think Scanlan, Polymorphed, something very teeny. And let her know the plan of releasing-- No, we can't wander on down into Vorugal's territory. That's why I said, if you Polymorph into a teeny, flying bug-- Dragons see a lot. A lot. Pretty close to the dragon. Be safe. This is dangerous. How are you going to stay in earshot? Just from the top of the cavern? I can cast Past Without a Trace on you. That's true. If we bust out the thing and then-- I don't know if Pass Without a Trace works if I'm not near you. Yeah, but there was no dragon last time. I want to sit on the door. I should've gone. I really should've gone. That's important. The Diseased--? Oh god, I didn't think about that. Can you inspire yourself when you're casting a spell?
