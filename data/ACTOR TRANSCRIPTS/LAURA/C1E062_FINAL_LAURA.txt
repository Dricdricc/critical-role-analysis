This is amazing! What?! Should we sit? Straight-up prep? Oh jeez. Your own fault, Grog! Vax is just strange. Oh my god! It's definitely not something we can wade across, I'm assuming. It's a big river. Can I perception and see if there are any sort of creatures that are visible? I can. Brother, do you want to scout up ahead? Maybe fly up above the river and see down into the oily land? Both of us. Yes, I can. And I do. I pick my broom up. I float above him on the broom. You are so hidden right now. I can barely even see you. So hidden. Oh, okay. I fly up and I stay above him. I don't want to land on the ground. You wasted your entire hour of flying for that? (laughter and applause) Oh, I got a Vax sigh. I like it. A what check? Oh, I got a natural one. (laughter) No! And I crawl over and grab it. I swing around and hit him with the broom. Disadvantage? Aw, come on. That was so much better than the first one. 13. I hate you sometimes. All right, I get on my broom and fly after him, like a loser. Yay, we're back. Can I float down and try to grab him? A wisdom saving throw? Shit, balls, mother-- that's bad nine. Can we try to get out? Can we try to get out of the water? Help. Right here. Are we underwater, or are we on top of the water? We're just dying. Oh, that's good. That's way better. Constitution?! Ugh! Oh Jesus! Six. Why am I rolling so bad right now? Can I cast Grasping Vine from the side of the river and try to catch myself? I don't know! I don't have my card because we're traveling. I'm scared of all my dice. No, that's good! 19. That's my broom that I'm holding up in my hand right now. I don't know. Where's my brother? Where's Vax? Oh no! (laughter) Was it a one? Can I send the vine to him? She did a ten-sider. That's good. That's better! Me and Vax are on one side, and everyone else is on the other, then? Actually, I'm going to use my earring so I don't have to shout. I feel like when I was crossing the river, I wanted to kill myself. And I'm afraid that anybody else crossing the river-- I think I have it. I thought Grog had it, but I think I might have picked it up after. There's so many rivers! Is it? Are we? Hey, Garmelie! Hi! Have you heard any stories about how people crossed these damn rivers before? I know! So tell me what you've heard! Cool. Did he make it? How far did he get? Scanlan, you're such a dick! Is that a natural 20? Put it away, Keyleth. Put it away for the rest of the night. Put it in its dice jail. Oh. Five feet. We could jump across them? Do you have Tree Stride? I thought we could all use it, always? How? No! This is really good! This is good, because with the Immovable Rod-- And then tie maybe the endless rope to it. And then you teleport back to the other side. I don't know. Trinket is safe in this necklace right now. Wait, did I hear right that these rivers are alive? What did I hear? You're going to chop down a tree? Grog, Keyleth picked a flower and the entire world ended. Oh, why didn't I think of that? I have the eternal string, and I have the rod. Don't do it, Grog! Do not do it yet! I'm going to start tying the rope to an arrow. All right. Are you going to teleport, and then we're going to try to do that? So you teleport first. I'll shoot the arrow, see if I can actually get it to stick over there, and then you can do the... All right, I shoot an arrow! Not directly at him, but pretty close to him. I have a really long-- I'm just going to shoot a couple arrows just to be sure. 17. A five. I hold the other side of the rope. And hook it to the Immovable Rod there. You can't use it anymore. You're not allowed to use that dice anymore. Oh, for strength checks I rolled... Percy, what did you roll for strength? We are so weak! Yeah, we should each tie the rope to all of us. Grog, you're on the end there with the rope. No, Grog! Around all of us, yeah. So Keyleth, too, you get a rope, as well. You get a rope! You get a rope! Oh, okay, sure. And Vax, of course. Obviously, my brother, who is standing right here very stealthily. You know, like you do. It's Grog, then Percy. Keyleth. Oh, right, because we've got to pick him up on the way through. We're on our way to you, Garmelie. Don't worry! Everybody holding on to the rope? Athletics? Are we in any kind of favored terrain right now? Okay, cool. 11 there, with the dice and the adding. Tie yourself on, there, Garmelie. (grunts) Get up and out. Up and out. How come we never noticed the battle map has a river on it? Oh no! 28. Oh no! Wait, where are we? I don't see us at all. I think he was between me and Vax. My initiative is really bad, as well. Go, Keyleth! 14. Yeah. He's got roots, yo. No! Don't do it! You do not touch that dice anymore. Yeah, kill him, Grog. Kill him! That would've been a smart move. Garmelie is standing next to him, too. We're all attached to him, though! Me? Oh, good. It misses. Me? Okay. I am going to send Trinket out and attack it with Bestial Fury. Trinket, attack the thing! Can I use my dagger that's on me to try to cut the rope that is attached to my front? Okay. Well, I'll attack with Trinket, and I'll pull my dagger out. Okay, that's good. Wow, I never attack with him. How about that. 26! It does. So does he do the bite attack, or does he do the claw attack? Okay, so now he's rolling for claws. Okay, so that's a 25 for the second one. Okay. Oh Jesus, I'm so stupid! Okay, that's eight? Yeah. And then, for the next one he gets two claws, and he's going to use his fours. Jeez Louise. Five plus seven is 13. No, 12. That's good! And then I cast Hunter's Mark! Can I try to fly up in the air? It won't do anything. I'm stuck on the ground. No, so I'll stay where I am, I guess. I'll continue to be flung around. Come on, brother! I don't know! Oh, Garmelie! Sing a song, Garmelie! Charm him! Do something! How many d6s? I have two more. Here we go. Then it wasn't there. Hey, you're out! Fuck! I mean, 20. Because that's my strength. Do I? Ten! Does that mean I lose my turn? I rolled a five. Bye! Oh, good. Okay. Oh, natural 20! Oh, you're in trouble, Samuel. You're so low. Grog? It's all for Grog? Is it just for you? Oh, are we just right back in? Me! Me, help me. Garmelie's helping! Okay! I know. Where it won't hurt anybody else around. Wait, here's some more d6. Take them. I don't know. So you heal him. I would be cheering for you if I wasn't drowning at this very moment. Oh. Well, that's a 15 there. Actually, that's a straight check. That's not a saving throw? 13. Can I ask Trinket to come up and help? Yeah. Four! He's stronger than me. Thanks, buddy. I get up and hug Garmelie. What! You saved me. You're wonderful. I tousle his hair. Good job, Keyleth! How you doing, Percy? Trinket, catch him when he falls. All right. How are you doing over there, gnomesies? There's nothing to loot on the petrified alligator, is there? I want to keep perception check up to make sure we don't run into another one of those fuckers. Yeah, Pike's already across. 22 for perception. Can't you save him? Aren't you on the other side? I'll go next. But I want to bring out my broom and hold it in my hand. Come on! That's okay. That's a 28, man. I fly up and I grab Pike down from the tree. Can I do that? Oh. I fly 15 feet up and grab Pike. Piggy-back that shit, Keyleth! Oh, Garmelie! No, he's going to leave. I mean, he can. I guess you got us all the way here, didn't you? We made it! Keep moving. Wait, before he goes, I want to give him a kiss on his head. As I was kissing him, can I give him a little pat down to make sure he didn't steal anything? (laughter and applause) 23. Well, now I feel wrong saying I reach for it and try to see what it is. Yeah! I take it back. Thank you so much. You're so kind. Oh, on him? Can I cast Hunter's Mark on him really quick? Can I cast Hunter's Mark on him? Sorry. I should've done it when I was kissing him, but I was distracted by feeling him up. Oh, in the mansion. Thank god. I cast Pass Without Trace on us so that we can be stealthy. She doesn't have mist form, not until we rest. I have Land's Stride. Does that mean that this doesn't affect me? Or am I still slowed down? Land's Stride isn't on any of my pieces of paper. Oh, wait. Here it is. Moving through non-magical difficult terrain costs you no movement. Then I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to pull out my broom and I'm going to let the gnomes ride on it, since you guys will sink down a little bit more than the rest of us. Do you want to ride on the broom? You sit on it, and then you fly. I'll say it for you. Oh, really? Sit on it. That's sweet. (hacking spit) Say (hacking spit). ASHLEY and So at least you guys and me aren't slowed down, so that's good. Can we see him? We're not in the forest anymore? This is bog? 20. So he's checking us out. So he's going to be able to get across all these rivers? He's pretty cool. He can jump really far. Yes, but stealthily. I cast Pass Without Trace on us, so we all got plus ten. Did you get something good? 32. Can I keep an eye out for any movement ahead of us or around us? 29. Does it look like the tree we're looking for? 80 yards. Fuck, I'm so scared of everything here. And it's a tree with a glowing bottom? What the fuck? Why? If he goes unconscious, he does automatically come back. But no, that's only within 100 feet, that's not 80 yards. No. I'm not slowed down, so you know what, I'm going to sneak behind Trinket. I'll send Trinket out, and I'll sneak 100 feet behind him. I'm sorry, buddy. Okay. Don't get too far ahead of me. We're going to sneak ahead and check out this glowy tree. See it? Yeah. All right. Sneaky-sneaky. That's mean. What do I add? Yeah, okay. Six. He gets no pluses. No. He's a bear in armor. No. Six. I tell him to stop. I call him back. I feel like that's animals. That's not the tree we're looking for. Come back in. So it's a tree that looks like there's people living in it? It's a window looking out? That's definitely a fairy tree. I'm going to stay clear. I'm going to go back. I'm going to go back to the party and tell them what I see. Trinket died. You're a dick. I'm joking. I think it's fairies. I think we should probably stay clear. It looked like there were things living in the tree. It doesn't look like the cancerous tree. How about no diplomacy from you. Maybe Scanlan should go talk to them. No. Oh, wait, you're taking the broom? (laughter) I do not like this plan at all. Can I go on the broom with you, Scanlan? If you fucking get my broom lost because you told me not to go, I'm going to murder you. And this is not in character. This is me telling you that. So we should call them back. What did you see? Anything useful? Should we call the gnomes back? I don't want to fight anymore before we get to whatever it is that we're getting to. Don't do it. Don't do it. Come back. Don't even fly close to the tree. I have really bad feelings about this. Fucking shit mother bitch! Please fly fucking back right now! Please! How far away is it? I go (surprised shriek). (relieved noises) (cheering) What do you mean? What? Thank you, Matt, for saving a marriage. Dude, you have to say good-bye.
