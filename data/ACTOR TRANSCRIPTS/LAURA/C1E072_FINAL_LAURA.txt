Backblaze. Bach braids! Brad! No. I thought pages binded together. I was going to say brad. What about our Halloween costume competition? I've been seeing some of them. It's Critical Costumes, is the hashtag, right? Yeah. Next week, I think, is where we're stopping. Halloween will be the last day? Halloween's the last day to submit, and then we're all just going to look at all your costumes and just decide who we like. I saw a really amazing Vex today. I'm just saying, I may be biased. But not that shirt. Thank you. Did you have dragon bits you wanted to gather? I got a little Yenk blood already. I can help. I want to go up and carve a bear onto the tree growing out of Vorugal. Yeah, like a lot. Grog! Fucking fuck! Do you guys have this? Give me a claw. I want a claw to wear around my neck. I want something to wear around my neck. Fucking something, all right! I'll take off on the broom after Grog. I followed too. I am following as well. I shout out, don't go up there! I fly down close to Tooma and say quietly, Thordak has means of seeing through the stones up there. If you go up top, it's possible he'll be able to know that Vorugal has fallen. He might already know. (laughing) Yes. And we thank you. Thordak the Ancient. He was commander of all of these dragons. You are not beholden to us. We ask this of your own free will. All of Tal'Dorei is at risk. It's true, Scanlan, they did help a lot in that regard. Draconia has had a history of separating itself from the rest of Tal'Dorei. This is an opportunity for you to welcome other communities, to become part of the rest of the world. You are strong. There's some under the ice right here. Wait, Grog. Can I check for any traps or is it like totally fine? Because I've been here before and it's not pleasant. Investigation? 18? What about the gemstones? Those are up high. I'm staying away from those. Do you have dragon's breath? Just keep on punching it, Grog. Just punch it. You're doing some good damage. No, we don't. You might want to ask Tooma if she has a problem with you taking all of Draconia's gold. Any looking-magically thingies? 16. Inspire me! Yeah, I only got 16. Six extra points, so 22. What color is the liquid? Another boots of haste! For sure! Definitely boots of haste! Pair of boots out of brown leather, you said? Ooh, sheets of paper! It is a natural 20, oh my god. How's it feel, Grog? Speaking of money, money, money. But if it's platinum, it'll help. We don't need any more than-- This is really nice. How many gold is a platinum? How many? They don't need to know. No! I'm tempted. This is amazing. Wait, I can hear you. Oh, you know what? Let's go back. You lost me. I'm out. (laughter) Okay, all right. How much? We got 40 pounds of black dragonhide in the Bag of Holding. Yeah, that's great. Did you take any healing potions? If you did you'd have an empty healing potion vial. I don't know how to. I'd rather him not know, right now, that Vorugal's dead because-- Yeah. Maybe let's not do that just yet. Well if he does, hopefully they'll be inside their caves? I don't think he's going to leave Emon to come check out what's going on with Vorugal, unless he knows that Vorugal's dead. Well, let's go back to the mansion. Maybe we can destroy it on the way out, if we feel necessary. What if there's a skyship in here? Maybe that's how the Ravenites can get to Emon, if they can help us? Did it look like airship or normal ship? Oh, right. I have no idea. Maybe on the way out we can see if it's uncovered any more. They've been working on this for a while now, is it possible to wiggle my way in and check out the mast now? 22. Elvish, Common, Undercommon, Abyssal and Draconic. That's crazy. It's a ship! I'm coming back out. I drop the Bag of Colding next to Keyleth. Ah, shit. What do we do? Oh jeez. We can't carry that. We just got to go through the tree, yo. That's it. What about the blood? Can anyone identify things in our group? Oh, you can read it! Are you calling him a priss? Oh, I bet Kima would want the shit out of that. I found a jewel. It's red. It looks pretty neato. They were great about it actually, they were quite generous. Wait, it had runes on it as well. Do they look similar to the runes that were on Greg-- Grog's sword? Did it look fluid? Yes. I don't know if it was an entire ship, but it was a ship. Well I got down, but most of it was still frozen. We should check that out before we go. It's so neat. Oh, that's great. You can make little clothes for it. Oh, and these boots! Are they magic, Scanlan? Does it seem evil or good? I want to put one on. I just want to see what it does. Oh no. Oh, that's painful. Here's a beautiful red gem. It looks special. The red beautiful gem you told me about. What about the bracelet, you also had a bracelet with a sapphire? No, you had a ring and you had a bracelet. That is so insane. I'm putting that in the party inventory. The Potion of Invulnerability, so we can decide later. Oh, thank you. Is it Boots of Haste? (yells) Oh my god, this is so crazy, because I was about to learn a spell, for somebody, but these take care of that. These are Boots of Feral Leaping. When you wear these boots you can instill your leaps with incredible bursts of power! As a bonus action you can attempt to leap. Make a strength check with a DC of 16. If you are successful you leap either 15 feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally. It doesn't say! There you go Grog. You need those. Oh, that's important. I have a question, because the spell that I was going to take, because I still have one spell that I haven't learned yet, is Jump, which triples your jump for one minute. So if I did that, would that triple that as well? Or would it just be Grog's normal jump? Oh, so that's perfect. Stealthy people need it, probably. Did you just give away something amazing? Oh, so it has to be a paladin. She can do 100 push-ups. Whoa. Ooh, to the back of it. Yeah, sure. Is there a lounge in the mansion, is there a bar? So yes, that's where we'll go. We're going to go to the wine room. How many charges are there? Oh. How many recharge a day? Nothing. It's going to be like three days for her to get them back. Don't do any more. Don't waste any more, Marisha. Don't do it. That's why I said Marisha. Pick the one that looks the fanciest. I go to the corner-- the highest shelf, I don't fucking know. These are probably all fake wine anyway. I fly up and grab the one on the highest shelf and fly back down. Oh no, it's chicken wine. Fuck. Whatever, we'll drink it anyway. It's going to be disgusting. That's funny. Fuck yes! Oh yeah, right, what's up? Thanks! Is that all you wanted to say? I didn't think so. Yeah. I think we have a good shot of it. Yeah, I noticed. Yes. Scary. I'm glad you're not dead. Oh, I gave them to Grog. Sure. I jump. It's a jump. A normal little jump. Why? Oh, yeah. So tell me what you're procrastinating about? Oh, you fuck. (laughing) What? (muffled) What are you even talking about right now? Do you want to see how high I can jump now? So high. I get on my broom and I fly up to the ceiling. (groans) Fine, fine! Hi. I don't know! I don't-- what? Okay. (nervous laughter) Yes. Yes. (sighs) It's just timing, you know? It's all timing. This is true. Hmm? His collarbone? I think he isn't thinking that way at all, and honestly-- I don't know, darling. It seems so trivial. Doesn't it? Yeah. I do have happiness! Wouldn't it be so awkward though? Hmm? Hey, I'm living a life. I've got Trinket. I've got you, sometimes, when you're not with Keyleth. I know. Very few. Yeah. (laughing) I want you to remember that you just said that. Oh, don't! Thank you. And I'll try. Oh, I know. Well, that's not true. No! Keyleth. They're like, so close. Yes you do! Okay. You want me to control him then. Get him under my thumb. Bring him to the light, just a little bit? I know what you're talking about. (laughing) I thank you. Hm? Glug glug glug? Well, all right. Okay, have fun. I pop Trinket out, cast Speak with Animals and have a nice fun conversation with him. Fenthras! And then head back to Whitestone. I mean-- Oh, no, we're fine in here. SAM and Oh, he's drunk. You have so many. You got it. What is that? Should we go find out? Oh god. This is ridiculous. Wait, it's not a two! Yeah, we're staring from the top of the stairs at all of it happening. Is Percy still on her back, piggy-backing? Grog! It's Keyleth. (whispering) He's drunk. Oh, that? It's Elvish. I did, it's impressive. No. Maybe you need to rest. Yeah. Well, Pike is resting because she was hurt quite badly. I didn't. Oh, yeah! You have a book? Do we keep our hit dice from our Heroes' Feast? If we never got rid of them? Or are they gone? I promptly rip the fuck out of my bill. You can do that while we look at the ship. Yeah. It's all in the same place. Right, so you have to attune to that. Is it any bigger? It's quite lovely, isn't it? You're welcome. I did it for you, Keyleth. I walk up to one of the guys going in, and say in Draconic, have you unearthed the giant ship yet? Oh, wow! It had some engraving on it. You speak a lot of languages, right? Pike speaks Dwarvish. Can we get inside of it? Is there anything to see inside of it? (hums the Jeopardy theme) Grog, go punch it. Natural 20. I hope there's really something in here. We should get out. Let's go. Really? Did you really do that? 29. Yeah, I see it. Can you get her out? Isn't it buried completely at this point? Maybe it was one of Vorugal's first kills or something? And it's sentimental? Like a blankie. He was a nautical kind of guy. He's up top. (groans) It's-- Did you see it? It collapsed. Good. I know! I'm looking at you. I'm looking in your direction. Ugh, goddamn it. Yeah. You saw them under the ice? You saw a couple under the ice? Where were the other ones? Were they there before it collapsed? Fuck! We should tell Tooma that-- I go find Tooma. Tooma? You know the stones we talked about? Yeah, they got jostled. It looks like that ice wasn't super-strong, and it collapsed. Not sure exactly. But you should keep an eye on the sky. If you see something red, maybe hide. Just for a while. Thordak doesn't know what was here. But if he realizes Vorugal's been killed, he'll come looking. Potentially. Oh, yeah! With your help, I think. Just in case he comes before we get to him. Good plan. Not. The time. (whispers) Fucking dick! Stop it! Of course. We all need to go up there anyway because that's where the trees are that we're going to transport through, right? We make our way to the top of the ravine as well. Eight hours! So you're pretty hungover, you don't have a lot. It disappeared. That's amazing. Oh, what what. He's got a really high modifier, though. As soon as the cube comes out can I talk to you, do you mind stepping away? No, not you. How are you, after dying? No, there hasn't. It's a lot in a few days. No, not for a while, I don't think. Yes. No. I have to tell you something Do you know what Fenthras means? It comes from the Elvish words, I'm surprised. Growth and protection. It's odd that Saundor had it for so long, since he was quite the opposite of that, don't you think? Yes. I don't know, I think he focused for so long on the betrayal of his love, on all of the horrible things within himself that caused that, that he became the physical embodiment of it. And I think he was trying to do the same thing to me. Even though I refused him, I could feel those seeds being planted. Self-doubt and loathing echoing in my mind every night. Reliving every wrong that people have done to me and everything I have done. That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. In the fight with Ripley. Your last words to her were, "I forgive you." It was such a surprise. I pull out Fenthras and I show him what I've carved onto it, it's "sinaeth." Do you know that word? It's forgive. I carved this on Fenthras because that's the key, isn't it? It's the only way to really grow. It isn't. Whoever that boy was that created those things, that suffered such horrors that he felt they were justified? You have to forgive him, too. Because everything you've suffered and endured and created in that time has made you into the person you are now. And you have a brilliant mind. And any darkness that might cloud your vision on occasion, the fact that you found it within yourself to forgive her means that it will never overtake you. He's terrible, isn't he? Just the worst. Maybe, he's probably hiding somewhere. I agree. And this engraving is a reminder that every time I attack, it's not out of vengeance. Never. Did you see the bear that I carved on the tree? It's quite lovely. Thank you. That's all. There's no room, we're in the woods. Oh man, oh man. Thank you, Backblaze.
