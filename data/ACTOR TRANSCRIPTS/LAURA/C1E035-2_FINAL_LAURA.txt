Cassandra, what are you doing? Well? Lovely. So glad that your smoke monster is seemingly gone, Percy. That's wonderful news. The spinning orb of death, however, is still back there, so we should probably figure out what to do about that. Probably. No, Percy! And I reach out and I grab his hands. As I reach up and I grab his hands as well! I step in front as he's unconscious and I go, Percy, dear. You'll thank us for this later, I know it. I kiss his cheek and say, I'm so sorry. It feels good, doesn't it?! It feels good! (laughter) You're not controlled anymore! [break] Overviews the city? I know what this is. I know what this is. Do I need roll perception if I know what it is? 15. Oh, did she freeze? Oh, she can still hear us but she's frozen. Pike is right here. We just left it? We haven't searched the castle? But there could be live people in there when we sealed it? Percival's just waiting for his introduction. Come on. No. In chains. Very heavy chains. Would you rather die? Make it look cooler on him, because he made it look dorky. There it is, looks good. It looks good, Scanlan. Brandon Gilmore? Allura? What about Ryndarien? It's possible that the Briarwoods have hoarded all of them. In fact, we might find something about this entity inside the castle. It is. Except he does it all the time. That's obvious. Ask how it's feeling, can you ask how it's feeling? Here we go. Yes! What about the pantsing? Is that included? Oh my gosh, you guys are boyfriend and girlfriend now. You get privacy. It's your moment. Percival? We're here. Keeper, may I ask for a small request? Could you maybe send a wonderfully worded letter to Uriel and let him know how we saved the day and how much you love us? That would be wonderful. Make sure you mention how terrible the Briarwoods were and how Vox Machina saved the day. Truly saved it-- Please? Yes, that would be wonderful. Thank you. You should've kissed her, it was the perfect moment! No but it was the perfect moment! I don't care, this is out of character! It would have been the perfect moment! Yay!
