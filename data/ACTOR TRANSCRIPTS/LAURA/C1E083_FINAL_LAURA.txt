Along with Brian W. Foster! What are those dates again? Hey, guess what? MATT AND There's some merchandise! (all cheer) You can buy it in the shop on Geek and Sundry. There's nothing new this week, but there's all the stuff that I talked about last week, like socks and hoodies and hats and bracelets and pens-- Oh, you missed it! Socks Machina! That's someday soon, guys. I'm hoping for that in the store. Gross, really stinky. No, they should look like barbarian boots, fur-lined boots since you're-- If you want. Yes. No. Yeah, I don't think I've cast it since we came out the other side. Natural 20 for Pike! No, Kima did. Four? Nothing. Failed you. Yeah, you're invisible. You have an invisibility ring. Wait, the twins are rolling too? I should've taken that 20 for myself, then. I don't know. Trinket's still in my necklace. I left him in because he healed. He's in my necklace. Okay. Did the party, as they were clomping along, did they catch up with us at all, or are they still that far back? Before any of that happens, though, I want to get Pike to step forward so she's within 30 feet of everybody. As many people as possible. Can she be right in the middle? But wait just a fucking second so she can cast Beacon of Hope on everybody! Just one second. She's trying to help you. Pike's like, "Just a fucking second! "Let me cast Beacon of Hope!" 30 feet. Which means that you are hopeful and vital. It affects everybody at the time of casting. I think. It just says range is 30 feet. Choose any number of creatures within range. For the duration, each target has advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and regains the maximum number of hit points when healed. I can't tell. Can I tell if it's really an illusion, or does it look like she's really there? Well, I couldn't sense her before when she was in her human form, so I'm assuming I can't sense her now. Yeah, I mean. I did the dragon-sense right before we came down this hallway and I sensed three dragons down here. Whereabouts are you? While that conversation's going on, I want to bamf Trinket out and send him around the other way. With Grog. Okay. Come on, Trinket! You're so quiet-- ooh! Trinket rolls a 19. Well maybe she doesn't know Trinket's here. Ooh, nice! Pike's going to walk to the middle, where she's in between the two parties. Like Reginald or something? What was his name? And then Pike wants to walk in between the two parties, so hiding behind that wall outcropping. I'm backing up, but I'm drawing an arrow and just notching it and waiting to see if she does anything to Keyleth. They'll leave a welt. You'll itch for days. I Hunter's Mark her. At 2nd level, because that's what I have. I sensed three dragons. Which she's good at. Oh man, I don't like hearing that. That's a bad Taliesin laugh. 24. Yeah, I did, I rolled for Pike. She got eight, Pike got eight. Those eggs don't even know you're coming. Oh no. Eggs, you guys. Eggs. Scrambled. Poached. That's me. I'm going to immediately say over the earring, "I don't think she's really there," and then try to look and see anything, any sign of her that I can spot. Can I see anything? 30. Oh. Okay. Fuck. I think I'm going to save-- I'm going to back up against the wall, just straight back. Yeah. Because I feel very uncomfortable with the situation and I'm going to save my attack for if Thordak moves, if anything moves at all, I'm going to wait to attack it. Yeah. In case Thordak moves or I see Raishan or something. Oh my god, that would've been so smart, though. Oh no. No. Good job, guys. I am holding my action until Raishan does anything. I hope she attacks-- well no, I hope we get to attack her soon. Do I see, did I-- oh god, I can't, it's not my turn. No. Did my hair go whoosh? Okay. I mean, a little bit. Oh? Bringing it back. There's potentially corpses in those cages that could be something. All right, sorry. That's okay, it's dead. It probably hits. Trinket's fighting every urge to go lick up the egg. (all laugh) Come on, he's a bear. Oh, you've been dispelled. Oh yeah. Well, wisdom. I feel like we aren't taking this seriously enough, you guys. 'Cause I feel like this could be really bad, right now. Oh my god. That was like the Addams Family version of 'My Boyfriend's Back'. Probably the feast. That's what happened before. And the Beacon of Hope. Oh yeah, good thing we brought Kima. Nice. Yeah. I didn't follow any of that. (laughs) (Pike voice) Yeah! Pike is going to cast-- (Pike voice) Yeah! (Pike voice) I'm going to-- Pike's going to cast Spiritual Weapon at level four. Right? She's putting it right in the middle of the hallway. (Pike voice) Yeah. And then-- oh no, it's protection, Scanlan. And then she's going to use-- I guess that's only within ten feet. She's going to cast Light. Just to create a little bit of better vision. On that pile of rocks in the middle of that. Yeah. Very bright! I'm thinking maybe that'll help spot Raishan or something. Yeah. Gotta get a natural twenty on that. Ugh, so annoying! Jesus, we're never going to get it off! Is there anything standing next to it? So it's Sneak Attack! (whispering) I'm your sister. Whoa. Okay, I'm going to-- I saw Keyleth say that she was in fog, so can I come around that corner and see her? 31. Okay, I'm going to attack her, and I'm going to try to do Bramble Shot. With the Blazing Bowstring. Oh yeah! Okay-- Bramble Shot isn't concentration, though. Can I shift it over to her? No, no, it was up. So once I-- it's like up. So once I knew where she was I could shift it. Okay. Okay. Okay, that's good, that's a-- what is that? 30. Or something. 32. That was-- okay, that's-- 26? Okay. So that's a Bramble Shot. Bramble Shot with the Blazing Bowstring. Oh, wait. Let me (Scottish accent) get my d8s out here. Thank you. (all laugh) 28 plus two lightning damage plus... six for Hunter's Mark. 34. Plus the blazing bowstring is nine. So 43. Points of damage. And then she has to do a strength saving throw of-- And then a strength saving throw. Oh, so she's restrained! But she's restrained in the fog. All right. I'm going to pull out a sleep arrow and do my second attack with a sleep arrow through the Blazing Bowstring. Just straight? 26. 14 plus one lightning plus two for sneak attack... so four more. And then, oh, and then a sleep arrow. Thank you. Thanks, you math genius, you. 5d8? 18? Okay. Well, it was worth a try. Oh, and then I'm going to use the rest of my move to duck around that corner and back up. Yeah. I want to be behind that stalactite or whatever-- Yeah. Mite. Stalagmite. I might hide behind that stalagmite. Really? She's invisible, though. So you don't need to burn the grit, that's great. Holy moly! C'mon Percival! She's casting something. Oh, she is still restrained? Oh. Let me find out, because let's see. You wrote it, I mean. The restrained target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Oh, and it's a DC of 17. Not 16. I have it written down wrong. Oh no. Oh no! There's nowhere to take cover, is there? Hold onto your knickers! Scanlan even got hit? Scanlan got hit in there? Ah, balls. Wow, that's impressive. The Beacon of Hope? Or was it just the one? This is like instant run away (laughs). One spell she does. No, Kima! That's right, wasn't she saving her action? I'm disintegrated. No, no, it's not like that. 22. Oh my god. Trinket got three. But he is, he is resistant to magical bludgeoning damage. Or bludgeoning damage, rather. Oh, he's unconscious and in my necklace. Good job, Trinket. He was within 100 feet of me, right? I'm glad I moved back. (gasps) Would he have been further than 100 feet if I hadn't moved back? Okay. 85, you said. Okay, and Pike got a nine. But she's fire resistant. All right. She's still up. Wow, that is a clutch-- That is major. My eyes are like-- You got upgraded! (All sing.) Oh my god. I'm so jealous! What do I do? What if I die without upgrading my bow? You're fine, you're fucking fine. I can't believe you haven't taken any damage. I mean, you'd better save all of us when we all die when you're flying around like-- I guess just like walking around. No, she didn't make it, she got five. Great. Nope. He's been exploded, yeah. It's so sad. He's just so happy. No, he's a bit of a snooty dog, actually. Barely, but standing. The other one was-- And Thordak is just even more watermelon. I look down at her like-- But if it was cocked, then it doesn't count. It was. Oh wait, no, it's not a concentration. No. Spiritual Weapon's still up? Yeah. What? Disintegrate? What'd he say? No! No. Please tell me that's a natural one that you just rolled and you're taking a picture of it. I don't want to roll it, it's too much pressure. 14? She's not by any of the paladins. With Disintegrate, does the body go away? I don't understand. Well, she's knocked unconscious, but the armor should bring her back. The effect of the armor-- Brings her back to five hit points. And she's on her feet. Is-- no, Raishan's not within 15 feet of her, is she? Okay. I can't, if Ashley's not here, you can't kill her when she's not here. If Ashley dies when she's not here-- Natural 20. Damn. 12. 20 for Pike. What did you do? Did you just burp really gross? I'm still up. Yep. Pike's down. Okay. Okay. Nobody else just willy-nilly make some rolls, okay. Do we have any wishes? First? Did she gain them all back? Did she heal all the way? I mean, what's going on? Well, fine. That's stupid. I like how red your face is getting. We don't do anything with dignity. (all laugh) No, no. Which one? Okay. I'm going to... Jesus Christ. I'm going to run over to Allura and I'm going to cast 3rd-level Cure Wounds on her. 3d8 plus three. Fifteen points. And then... 30 feet, no. Fuck! That's my action, isn't it? I guess as a bonus action I'm going to... hide? I'm such a loser. Yeah? I guess? Okay, let me see if I have any health potions left, though. I have a regular healing potion left. So I'm going to take that. Ooh! Eight points healed. And a stealth check. Can I not have gone back behind the stalagmite, I want to go around the corner. Yeah, like that. Okay. That's fine. I rolled a 16. I think it's time for some Advil. (all laugh) That's good, that's good. So you could. Because a full round is four attacks? Or three attacks? I bet it's four attacks. This could be it, Scanlan! These could be Scanlan's final words. Raishan gets four attacks, so if you would've failed that, your instant death save would've failed. Can anybody feel it flying past? Great. Oh my god, oh my god. Great. She surrenders. Doesn't matter. I'm still alive, you guys! Still standing. I'm not standing. Still-- Did you say 21 points of damage? Oh, that's it? 13. Oh, damn it. Sucks that you were knocked prone. Yay! Hit her! Finally! And she's just like covered in blood, she's just so beat-up. Oh god, she's like right there. Just her butt. Pike. Okay. No, she's up. She's going to stand up and, if she uses her sprinter's boots, can she run over to Scanlan and cast Revivify? Would she be able to get to him? Okay, then she's going to cast Revivify on Scanlan. Pike didn't have it. So... (small voice) Nine. God fucking damn it! She's going to throw Sacred Flame at Raishan. And that's at 17th level, which she's at now, right? It is. Balls. Great. Tight. She-- can she do like a heal-- Healing Word, tight. She's going to do that on herself, then. Sure. 11. Oh, she's really smart. Are you okay? That's karma for trying to kill Pike while she's not here. Her feeble little mind. Come on! You're going to have a big ol' bump on the back of your head. Jeez, how are you? Oh yeah, he was in the hundreds. Okay. Using disengage, can you run past them with disengage? Okay, but I'm already in range of her. Oh, really? Okay. How far away, if I ran past her, would I be able to get? If I ran to the other side of her. Okay, then I'm just going to back up. I'm just going to back up into that-- dink dink dink-- Yeah, and I'm going to shoot her. Yeah, I already used blazing bowstring. Okay. 17. Oh my god. I'm just doomed today. 18. I'm going to use-- well, I didn't use disengage. Well, that's okay, I'll use my bonus action, fuck it, to do Grasping Vine. It's a bonus action. From the ground. I'm going to grab Raishan and pull her to the ground. Mm-hm. 15! (All cheer.) I say, "You stay down, bitch!" And I'm going to go to the bathroom. No, stop it, stop it. God, she's just going after Percy. She had a crush on you, man. My hand-dragon's on your shoulder. (laughing) Not like this. Like seriously, Sam has stacked up his binder, he's closed everything like he's getting ready to go. (tearfully) I just rolled bad, I'm sorry. Wait a minute, did she even roll to break her Grasping Vine? Does Kima have Revivify, do you think? No, Pike has lots more spells. She's got little legs. Like, the ultimate punishment for Scanlan is he would show up as a spectral servant in somebody else's mansion? Yeah! Kerrek just like leveled up to like... Oh my god. What's happening? Vax? Are you up? Good. Percival? How are you? "Percy?" I go running around the corner. "No. No!" And I run over to him. "Help him! Pike!" On Percy. I-- Oh, no. Is that a five? Plus what? It's not going to work. Eleven. I don't know. 'Cause the necklace just instantly bamfed him back. I just kiss-kiss-kiss-kiss, tears-tears-tears-tears. Welcome back. Don't look down, you're a bloody mess. Scanlan was down. Pike looks at Kima. "Can you do anything?" No. Can Allura do-- Why is she rolling? Pike's going to cast Detect Magic and see where it's coming from. Can she see if it's coming from anywhere? I'm going to third-level Cure Wounds you. You're probably at one. So I'm going to Cure Wounds on you. 24. Pike looks at the book that's emanating magic. Does it look like it's an evil book at all? Pike's going to take off her scarf and throw it over it and try to cover it and wrap it up in cloth. And ask Grog to put it in the bag of holding and wonder if that'll make the magic go away. I take the gate stone and put it back. Let's not walk around this place anymore. I'm going to use my Rope of Entanglement and grab him. Yeah, ferry on the carpet and the broom. Pike casts Light on her mace so that it's a nicely lit thing, it's not all creepy and dark. Are they technically undead? Then Pike's going to use her-- Yeah, she's going to use Turn Undead on those motherfuckers. But they can shoot Fireballs, so maybe that's not smart. Yeah. I'm going to just shoot them with arrows and try to get them from far away, I guess. Well, yours has a probably good range on it. I've got 120 feet on my bow. So I'm going to do-- Pike's going to do Sacred Flame on them, too. Pike does Sacred Flame. She's a 17th level cleric now. It's a cantrip. So it's just 4d8 damage. Mm-hm, 4d8 radiant damage. Oh yeah, that's good. 22 radiant damage. They have to do a dexterity saving throw. Cool. So one of them takes 22 damage. I'm going to do the one that Percy just hit. Oh. Well, there's four of them. Cool, well, she chooses one. And then I'm going to, as Vex, shoot arrows at them. That doesn't hit because the world hates me tonight. And that one hits. 17 damage. These are hardy skulls. Oh, I grab those immovable rods when we get out of there. We can go to Greyskull Keep. Sarenrae's temple. I mean, that's where our chapel is in our house. I don't understand. No, Kima! Does anybody know what the fuck-- What was that supposed to look like? What it was supposed to look like? (tearfully) Scanlan does. I mean, as perception thing, if we've seen a teleportation circle before, would we at least know that it doesn't look like it's supposed to? We don't. So we have to make this decision stat? But what if it took them somewhere-- Oh my god. What if-- where did they just go? What if we just sent them to some plane of existence? What about the ball? Yeah, on the carpet. Pike's going to cast healing on people. Everybody's low, super low. If we would've gone through... Well no, we have the fucking magic carpet. Oh my god. Keyleth. We need you right now. She'll figure it out. She's so powerful. Yeah, yeah, yeah. (gasps) I take off on the broom. I take off on the broom, I'm out. In the direction that she went. Yeah, I'm going, I'm going. I went. I fly over them and just tell them, "Hang onto the broom!" 13? Keep holding, we're almost there, darling. I have them. We have them! We have them! (wailing) Like little Dobby in Harry Potter. Whitestone. We've got six seconds, go! Get him to the castle. Right? Who can send me there? Who can send me there? I'll go. I don't think so. We need to get her and bring her here. I've got the gate stone, yes. Find the other gate stone. I take off to find Gilmore. No. Well, he is her champion. I just run straight up. "Darling." Do you have teleportation? Do you have anything that can send me to Kymal. Kymal? To Kymal. Please. (tearfully) Do you know of a city nearby? Anything? (tearfully) I don't know what to do. Scanlan's down. We have to find his daughter. I just need to get there. She's out. Out of spells. Probably gave him some clean pants because he's covered in piss. Why? I guess so. Trying to prepare that, yeah. I feel like it's bad to wait. Teleportation. Shaun. Can you do it? Then can you send me to Kymal, please? Yes. Urgently, darling. "Sure." I give Shaun a kiss on the cheek. I'm looking for a tavern, probably the only one in town. Yes. I'm just terrified of all my dice. 16? Wait, but I didn't add anything to that. Investigation... that's a 23. Fuck. Stay by the bar. I'll be right back. Fine. Yes, darling. And I run off. Kaylie. I smack her across the cheek. Darling, your father! Scanlan. Tell me you're sober. Are you sober? Ah, fuck. Your father's hurt. "Kaylie!" And I pick her up and bring her up to my eye-level. Your father. He died. But there's a chance we can bring him back, if you're willing to help. Defending everyone. Saving the fucking land, can you believe it? He died with piss all over him. Will you go? Will you help? Kaylie. I set her on the table so we're still eye-level. All his words were of you. Look, I know a little bit about having a father who wasn't around. Right? Take it from me. It's not worth it. It's not worth harboring this hatred in your heart. If you can find it in yourself to forgive him, you'll live a much happier life. 25. I pull out the stone and I put it in her hand. Concentrate. Concentrate on him. It'll bring you to him, I swear. Please. Kaylie. You can take whatever you want. Just promise me you'll try. It's just going. Yeah, he's not here next-- No, Sam! See, Grog? See? Oh my god. Nice! Yeah, right? Pretty fucking great. Keyleth and Kerr MVPs for sure.
