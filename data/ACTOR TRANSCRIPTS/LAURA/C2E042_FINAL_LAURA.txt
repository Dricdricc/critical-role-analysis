Oh my goodness! I got something! No, it's not on the thing, but I have it anyway. Are you wearing it? We have our hoodies, back in stock in shop.critrole.com. It's new and improved. Yeah, 2.0. This really awesome text was hand calligraphed? Calli-- how do you say it? Did I say it right? By Chris Gladis and then we turned it into this graphic, and so it's really gorgeous. Yes! And it's super soft still. Then the other thing that's in the store now that we didn't tell you guys about ahead of time is something I'm very excited about. We have baby onesies! There's not a ton of them because how many Critter babies are there? I designed this one, it says, "I wanna be a monstah!" It's got a mace rattle! (whispers) We could totally push her off the cliff right now. She just slipped. I think that guy was wearing a wig. Yeah, it was a really bad-made wig. I mean, the hair looked good, but it was really obvious. Ooh! How long have you been a pirate? Whoa! I'll stand, too. Arr! We know that because we're pirates too, and we know those things. But you can still fight other people? For fun? Are you looking for a fight? Why? Tusktooth? I punch him in the chin! Unarmed strike! 14? No, 15. Four points of damage! 16. Oh, I turn and he hits my shield. I swipe at him with my tail and try to trip him. 19! Just knock him prone. Oh, okay, so I would add 13 plus athletics. 16. Wow, you're quick! I'm 18. Okay, I'm going to reach out and try to punch him in the back of the head. Oh no. Natural one. Fuck me. How much damage was that? Okay, okay, okay. Oh, no, should I be mean? I'm going to grab him after he hits my head and I'm going to try to knee him. That's good, that's 23. Four points of damage right between the legs. Below the belt. I'm going to grab his wrist and try to spin him around. 16. Yeah! I'm going to grab him and try to grab both of his arms and hold him on to me. Yeah. Oh no, that was really bad. Five. Say uncle, say uncle! Do I still have a hold of him? Ooh, ooh, I'm going to turn my head and try to hit him with my horn. Oh, that was cocked. Crazy cocked. 19! Oh no, six. Can I do a breakdancing move where I spin around and jump up? Like Arya did in that episode of Game of Thrones. Arya. Yeah. 13. No! You're crazy, Sorris. I like you. Boom! Right in the face. 16 to hit! I'm going to say All right, all right, all right. We're friends now, okay? Let's not do any real damage to each other. I'm going to pat his head and cast Cure Wounds. I don't want to knock him out, he's cute. 1st-level. That is six points of healing. We're friends now. You're welcome. Oh no. Ooh, 21? Yeah, no. All right. Hey! I made a friend! The Little Sapphire. That's my pirate name. Do we recognize her? Who was that? Oh, yeah. Coasters are not heavy enough. Do divers die there? Would I have heard ghost stories? 19! I mean, I read a poem about her. Her hungry eye. Doesn't she have a ring or something that you said in the song? No, I know it, I just didn't-- I mean, I read it like, one time, a long time ago. Yeah. No, why would you ever get a bad feeling about that? Her hungry eye. Oh, Dashilla. Well, we didn't fight them under the water. She's an underwater banshee. For sure! Mm-hmm. Yeah. It sounds a lot like glubby glubs. (underwater glubbing) Sure. Oh, you totally could have gotten the stuff from that guy. Definitely wouldn't. Bye. Did any of us see that? (laughter) 15. 15. Mm? I don't understand what-- Yeah! Well, of course I do, I always have a lot of stuff on me, here you go. I thought it was Allison. That's so pretty. We've reached a new level. I'm staring at this milk that I ordered and it's really disgusting. And I-- No, it has lumps in it. Yeah. What? I seem off? Oh. I just, well-- Bless you. I don't like her very much. No. Oh, but we're all kind of murderers sometimes, aren't we? No? I mean, we have killed some people. No, I don't. I haven't ever done that. I've done some pretty shady stuff though. Have you done some shady stuff? Have you done stuff that's pirate-y before you were a pirate? What's the shadiest thing you ever did? That's okay, though. But it is a really cool trick. They got to see magic. That's true. It all balances out. You've done really good things, too. Do you want some of this lumpy milk? No. I know! She's so nice! And now we're pirates and I'm never going to see her again. It's really possible, Caleb. What if we can never go home? Nott definitely doesn't want to be in the sea. I think Caduceus doesn't like the water, either basically because it tried to kill him a few times already. I don't even know if he likes it a lot. Like Avantika. I don't know. It feels funny. Well. You know, when you really like somebody, but then you start to know them, and you go, "Do I like them or do I like what I thought they were?" and then you don't know? And then you think that they are flirting with you, but then you found out that probably weren't, you know? So you feel kind of sad about it and maybe a little stupid. You had a girlfriend before though, yeah? (whispering) You said her name when we were dancing and then I put you to sleep and you said her name again. Was she pretty? Was she a boy? Oh. Okay. I'm trying to get an image of her in my brain here. Did she have like a really good nose or something? Really? You're mysterious, Caleb, you know that? And now she's saying we all have to take the same boat. How are we going to get away from her? Just literally right there at the table. Are you okay? Tomorrow, we find some books! Yeah, that's important to him. Yeah. Thanks, Caleb. (giggles) I thought about it. It would have been pretty funny for you to wake up, but I like you more than that. Are we sleeping on our boat? Where should I go? I guess just sitting in here for a while. All of us together? I hit his hand. High five! Well, if we don't come back, can't you take the Mistake and go home? Two weeks, if we're not back in two weeks-- Mermaids are part pretty people and part fish people. Well! Yeah. Let's go. Can I have taken, I'm assuming, a short rest and heal up from my fight while we were all chilling here? (whispering) Whoa. It smells like poop out here! Keep your hands on your coin purses. Tiffany. That's the name Tiffany's Ship. Your heart? The Apricot is your heart? Tiffany can be invisible though, you guys. I'm going to keep an eye out to see if the mist ever parts around us. Don't you think it's weird that someone would be a pirate and they would come here because they were a pirate and then they change their mind and decide to be a shopkeeper here instead? You shouldn't use her real name. I like him. I just remembered. Well, I have this new spell that the Traveler was telling me about. It lets you pop in somewhere. You can just pop in and then you can bring somebody with you. It's like a doorway. I would pop into her office. That's a really good question! Let me think about it. Hey, Traveler, how far away can I use this spell? 500 whole feet, he says! I don't know how we would get out of it once I was in there though, because I can only use it once but I suppose-- Yeah, but wouldn't somebody be keeping watch on the ship, though? And do what? Should we be using your name or should we call you something else right now too? Will we be using the fancy doorway? Well yes, but that is-- That's the thing, she would definitely see there was a new door. I can't go twice. I can just do it once. Tiffany. Honda keeps Tiffany busy. I should bring somebody with me. Okay, me and you, Beau. You don't want yourself connected with this at all. Plus, here's the thing. Caduceus is really perceptive. That's true. That's true, you could be Sorris. Ipess! That's right! We never get into trouble together. I mean, this is foolproof. Any time we've tried to do anything together, it went off seamlessly. We could stay on the boat. That would solve all of our problems. I mean, we've been staying on it already, don't we have quarters on there? We all wait until Fjord starts boning, and then we start our action. This is way more complicated than I thought it was going to be. Avantika knows, I mean Tiffany knows that that owl is yours, Caleb, it's not like it's a secret, if she's seen the owl before she's going to know you're spying on her. His boning makes thunder. His weenie. We head towards the ship. We walk towards the ship. Shouldn't you be able to Message Nott and say she's on the move if-- So maybe stay close where you can see it if she leaves? Yeah, we can just go to our quarters or something. Yeah. What do you think? Because it's our ship. Is it within 500 feet of-- Fuck yeah. Yeah, let's go to our quarters in the Bloated Cup. Start it in the tavern! Could always use advantage. We could potentially jump out the window too. What are you talking about? I'm so dextrous. We're up in our rooms. Nott, just look at the dodecahedron. Okay. Yeah. She stole mail one time. That and her beautiful hair. (laughs) I wasn't, Beau, I love your hair. I wasn't laughing at you! I wasn't laughing at you, I love your hair, okay. (whispering) Left. Second room on the left. Oh. I see. Okay. I don't need to be able to see it. I know exactly the spot I desire. I can visualize it because we've been in her office before. I don't know. I've never done it before. Never. Doorways are the tits! I cast Pass Without a Trace on both of us. We are amazing! We need to start looking because we only have a few minutes. Okay, start looking. Can we both see, because we both have darkvision? We should probably figure out a way to light up the room. Are there curtains? No, we should close them. I sneak over and close the windows quietly. Oh, you already have advantage? Blessing of the Trickster! There you go, I gave you blessing, so you get advantage. (gasps) Natural 20! Plus ten, because Pass Without a Trace. 24? No, wait. 34. Does she have a candle in the room that we could light? Take your cloak off and shove it under the door to block the light. I take my cloak off and I put it next to the doorway to block the light. I light the candle. We start searching through her office. We're looking for anything she's written about where the last fruit tree is, the last temple. I'm going through papers. I'm looking through her desk, seeing if I can find any false bottoms or anything like that to try to find secret information. Each make an investigation. Oh, we get advantage? No. Shit. Nine. Which is like a natural 20 in this campaign. Okay. This is better than three. Oh no. Hit the deck! We hold our breath! I take out the paint and I paint a hole in the bottom of the floor. In! I try to pull it open. 18. I was just looking, but you can take, okay. Sure. (negative noises) Is there a rug in the room? Then I pull the rug over the hole that I just made after we go under. Oh shit, I do the same thing, I see her do it and I grab my thing and blow out the candle, and go. Two. As I go down the hole, I pull the rug over the hole. I have no idea where this takes us. (whispering) Take one of the things you stole and put it next to them. Oh no! That's okay. 18. Shit. What if the poison is still up there? I will lift Nott up, to peek her head through. No! What? Okay, I bring-- I crouch down so Nott can-- (whispering) What? What's going on? Nott! Shit! Can I cast Lesser Restoration on Nott? Nott. Snap out of it. Nott! I don't know. I didn't even look. Condition-- no. One condition affecting and the condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. Okay, that's good. Oh my god! What do we do? I heard them yelling. How do we get off of here? What should we do? We left a hole in the floor. Nott, tell her nothing crazy, you know. You don't want it to connect to us or anything. I don't know. Maybe we can just get out. Oh, right. Okay. What are we going to disguise ourselves as? Are we still going to do that? No, it doesn't make any more sense, though. What if I make another hole in the floor and we keep going down until we can get out. Can I-- Can I stand up on the bed and try to make the hole look like it wasn't perfectly painted, like it was like broken wood? Can I do that, though? I wonder if I can use one of my pieces of paper to like put on there and then make it wood, like, fix it. That's what I thought was going to happen, but I wanted to see. Good show. Okay, I'm going to do what I originally planned which is to make the hole not look like a perfect hole. To make it look like the planks broke or something? Oh wait, no, should I do that? Leave the fucking hole the way it is! We'll leave a couple gems in the bed. Two gems in the bed. Oh, come on! No! Perfect. Now we disguise ourselves, yes? We'll wrap our arms around each other and then disguise ourselves. No. Oh, okay. I'm going to be Molly. In pirate clothes. Yeah. With a cloak over his head! I did it. I already said it. Still Pass Without A Trace. Still trying to sneak out. 24. 22, lies. No. Shit. Run! We run. Are we being stealthy? Were stealthing. Quickly. We're stealthing! Still Pass Without a Trace. 21. The seaward side? Put that book in the bag so it doesn't get wet. I don't know. We jump in. Let's try to go in quietly. This is going perfectly. Oh my god, that was almost a one. But it's not. It's a 19. 19. Don't let go, Nott! Natural 20! But Disguise Self, to where we look dry. Do you think I seem noticeable? Yeah, but we're Disguise Self, so we look dry. Yeah, I feel like you may be less noticeable than a purple me. Okay. Yeah. Is anybody in the shit alley? We should probably drop our forms. Yeah. In the shit alley. (gasps) Oh my god! No. Nott, I have Mending. It's a cantrip and I can mend things that have holes in them. Not a hole that big. It wouldn't have worked on a hole that big. Everything we did was perfect. I mean, it went according to plan. Shh, hide that. That's in my bag, anyway. Oh! We need to hide those too. What the fuck are we going to do? If she searches our shit, she's going to know that we stole. We got to figure this out, like stat. All right. You did too, you're pretty cool! Okay. We're going to go into our rooms. Hi! You're going down there? Don't go down there, Caduceus. No, there's guards everywhere! Schmidle of a one. What do you mean? They'll know. Oh. Should we look around the room and make sure nobody can spy on us? Look for peepholes in the room. That keeps sound in. We got a book. Nott found it. Yeah. When we were looking for letters and words and stuff, we ended up breaking her desk and we stole a bunch of jewels-- Well, and then the room filled with poison and then we put a hole in the floor and we fell. Then we jumped in the water and we got away. The thing is, though, Avantika's going to definitely know that somebody stole her stuff. I like Jamedi; I thought he was nice. Well, yeah, but-- If we hold on and Avantika's like "Let's everybody empty their pockets" and we have them! I think she's in love with Avantika, too. Because she pulled me aside and she was like, "I don't like Fjord and I'll kill him if you "want me to." Eight. Okay, so maybe she didn't say that. But I still don't think she likes Fjord very much. The jade necklace A given. To what? Cracked the case. Fjord, are you as crazy as she is? Because holy shit. Not your saving throw. You have maxed out intelligence. That's a necklace. It doesn't say the name. It'll come right out. Apricots, Fjord. If-- I know, we shouldn't have grabbed everything. We could just throw them in the ocean. Yeah. I like it. Caleb's brain. We're part of the crew. Big lead safe, not in the bag. But the little box that we have the thing in, yeah. Oh no, it's getting late. I'm getting confused. Too late. I was sleeping in the room. Is there anything in the room that seems like it could be hollow or anything? I'm looking for somewhere that I can put a hole in it, hide the jewels in there, and then Mend it so that it won't look like anything ever touched it. But I'll know where they are. Do I get advantage still, if this was last night? Okay. 13. Yeah, but if I get searched-- Yeah. Yeah, and you don't think she's going to go, "Open this safe?" If she turns the bag over and empties it out, everything comes out. If you turn the bag inside out-- Okay. Okay. This was last night. I was looking for a place to hide. What? What does the hallway look like that all the rooms are in? Okay, okay. I have to get dressed, that's all. That's the thing Okay. The whole bag? I don't want to lose the whole haversack. I do not want to lose the whole haversack. Nope. It's got the Dodecahedron in it. Nope! TALIESIN. No. Is there ever a moment it looks like nobody's looking at us, or me? No. Seven. Can I fall back and talk to Bouldergut? Bouldergut, what is going on right now? Me too! Everybody seems so angry at everybody else. Look at the ship right now! It looks crazy, all these people walking around. Me too! While I'm talking to her and hopefully when I point at the ship-- Does she look where I point? 22. I reach in the bag and I pull out the jewels and I dump them off the side. I want them to fall in the water as we're walking. (singing) I wish I had looked at the Dodecahedron this morning. (normal voice) 15? Bouldergut was in the back, though. Oh my god! Yeah. Yeah. And like, a principal that always knows when you're lying. MARISHA and
