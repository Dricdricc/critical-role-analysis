Always, always. Yeah, so many. Oh, yes, we do! So if you guys check the store right now, there should be some Strongjaw Ale shirts available. I was getting some tweets about it, that, you know, we hadn't put those in store for a long time, so, we made some more and put them in the store. Along with the Gilmore shirts, and the How do you want to do this? and the regular logo shirt. All of those things available plus there are some How do you want to do this? hoodies left from the pre-order stock that we had a long time ago, so, there's a few of those left in the store, and... (ding) I have a tweet. Sorry. Sorry about that, and we also have these new, wait, where'd I put it? - Where's my book? - Oh, I have it out. We have vinyl stickers now, you guys. Aren't they so spiffy? Yeah, I'm excited about those, so those are-- Those are here. Those are in the store for you. - For sale, Sam! You get-- you get-- you want one? - Here you go. - Do you guys want some? So, yeah, there's all that stuff. Yeah. And we have more hats too. There's hats again. All these things, you guys. Just so many things. - Yeah, we're trying to do away with, like, the whole, you know, pre-order and wait a really long time to get your stuff, so, now we're trying to keep things in stock so you can actually buy it. Yeah! Oh, man. Oh God, I got to-- Sorry. - Yeah! Should we get, I don't know, does it matter to get any of his blood? Maybe we can track him easier? - The body? Yeah, Thordak's blood. I took a lot of potions, so I'm assuming so. I lick, I lick the bottle for all the remaining healing. - Like a Capri-Sun. Maybe give it a moment just to let the lair actions die down a little bit. The-- you know, all the lava stuff happening in there. It's safe? - Eight whole points. - Romeo. What do you do with those last two? Yeah. Actually, before we go back in, can I peek up on the surface level and see if it looks like the fighting has died down? Yeah. - Twenty-seven. - So, we can't-- can I reach into my shirt and grab out that note that was on the arrow? I never read it. - What is it? Oh, I knew it! We have to find them. Just stealth. To see if it looks like the giant is gone, and if Zahra and Kash are around. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Twelve. - I know. I'm-- you know, I've-- I'm injured grievously. Oh, shit. Keep it down, you fuck! Come on, come on into this hole. Oh, God. - Giants, giants at the door. -Giants! - Can I shoot an arrow at him? What the fuck? (applause, cheers) Scooch on by since it's so easy to make your way. (laughing) The whole set falls down. - Kerrek, you can fight! I thought you were-- I thought-- you can fight? Uh, yeah, you just brought down a giant, no big deal. Yeah. - Is it? I mean, eh. Thordak was killed. Mm-hmm. Yes, the thing is dead. - And gone. Literally, gone. - Stolen. Can I hug Zahra? Yeah, yeah, I know, darling. Injured. He just killed a giant with his giant hammer of blazing white-- Maybe we should go down. - I'm so sorry! Isn't Pike still down there? You're gonna put it in your butt. (laughter) - What are you doing?! - Constitution saving throw! - Can I run up to him? - Scanlan? Smack him a couple times, does he wake up? Can I roll him over? Oh my God. Only eight. - But I've got a Cure Wounds potion I can-- a Cure Wounds spell I can use. Eight. - Can I do a nature check to see if I recognize the scent? I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds on him, just to try it. Well, regardless of what's going on, you healed 13 points. Can I smack him across the face as hard as I can? - Even though I just healed him. I don't understand. Can I do investigation check? Cause I'm good at hiding things on my person. Goddammit, I'm rolling like shit! Ten. I'm Vex, hi. - Hi. What the fuck did you do? Face down. What's a lair action? What's in this flute, you piece of shit? What's in the flute? No, you're too short, you can't even reach. There wasn't a lot of time there, Scanlan. You died, so did I. Well, it's not now, so, when? Truly, here's the thing. - If she had succeeded, if we hadn't attacked her when we did, and she had succeeded in whatever she's about to do with Thordak, you know, we probably would have had to fight a much more powerful Raishan or Thordak again or whatever the fuck she's doing. Jenga, I think it's jenga. Oh, no! - Oh my God, if I roll poorly on a perception check for loot, I'm gonna be so sad. About what? I know, but-- Got our asses kicked. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you can come down and join us whenever you like. Oh, shit, did J'Mon fly here that entire way? I was joking, I was joking. Kind of feel like, we should, you know-- Heal up a bit. I've been here before. It didn't go so well. Like really, really knocked to shit. Oh my God, are you Raishan? Oh, shit. I mean she's-- - She's basically black cinder right now. She face planted into lava. Kash, how low are you on healing? Can you heal us? I nudge Vax. I think that guy's puttin' moves on your woman. -Okay. - It's good, it's good. -Thank you. - And I'm hugging you. I heal Vax 12 points while I'm hugging him. I know. Immovable rod. I think I have it. - Ooh. No, Travis! (laughing) - What are you even doing? What are you doing? A carpet? I go over to Grog. What do you have in your hand? Can I see them? What's that tapestry he's talking about? Yeah. - Twenty four. Do you fly, fly? Try to fly right now. Go up in the air. (spit) - Well, that's my code word for my flying broom. No, I'm gonna roll it up and save it for later and look around for other cool stuff. I don't know what can come out of that thing, but like, really bad things can come out. I've heard that--oh, God, there's cards right there. They had 'em right there! I know it's really-- it can be really bad. Didn't they pull this out during one of the charity games? Oh, God, oh, God. I don't know. How dare you not prepare? If Travis gets a hold of it... Oh, God, I'm terrified. I don't know what all the things are that they can do. Do you know, you know, you know all the cards. Oh, God, oh, God! Oh, my God, what if we're all about to die? 'Cause it could be world ending, right? It could just... It's a giant... A card turned into a sword? I mean seriously, though. Well, go hit something with it. Grog, also don't forget this is property of Emon. A scimitar. Yeah. What are you doing? I pick them up. Grog just made a sword out of one of these cards. Do we know what this is? I start to open it up and-- I think these made weapons. I just shut the little case and stuff it in my... Oh, Grog, that's sweet. No. Yeah, no, I don't trust you with it. Because you do stupid things. You made a beautiful sword and I'm proud of you. Maybe there's another set in here, we should find it! No, if we find another set, you can have it. Oh, my God. Do they look Elvish? Okay. Sweet. I can't, can I see if they're magic, I can't can I? I'm gonna do that on the tapestry. Fly, fly for me. One hundred. Shut the fucking--! You guys! Lift higher. ♪ High up in love ♪♪ Oh, you guys, this is wonderful. Waahhhhhh. Oh, shit. - Eight hundred pounds, it can carry more than the last one. It's six by nine. This is like the California king version. What's my carrying capacity on my broom? I should probably know this. Well good, so... Okay. Oh, this is amazing. This is some good stuff. I mean, it looks similar, it's a bit bigger. Definitely, Keyleth. - Hey, look at these boots, I throw them down to you. They look kind of Druidish. I know, right? I think the color looks nice, it would look good with your dress. I mean basically Keyleth would be naked this whole time 'cause all of her clothes would have burned off in the lava. All right, sure, whatever. Ooh, can I fly up on the carpet and see if anything catches my eye from above? Not that I couldn't have done that on my broom, but I feel a little safer 'cause there's stuff all around me. I'm gonna lay down and... Yes. Hop on over, Perc. That's a lot. No, no, no, it is. We need to return this to the people of Emon, I mean, that's who this money came from. Yeah? - Oh, do I see anything from our keep? Not that I can see. People will have to put in papers with the counsel. Something. I did give 20 pounds of gems when we were down in the city of Brass, maybe I can find some more gems. We do have a lot of, we do have a lot of money right now. Oh yeah, smart, smart. Smart, Grog. Yeah, so like we have-- Yeah. 1,000 platinum for the group then? - Okay. Yeah, totally. No, no, no, not unless you want to be. Yeah, if you guys want to grab stuff yourself. Same. I'll take...so hard. Nice, Grog. (laughing) Fifty platinum, so it's lighter. And looters will come down here and take far more than we did. We owe The Clasp half of our loot. If we don't take as much, then we don't give them as much. It's not our money, it's Emon's. How do we even know who we told? It could have been two underlings, nobody would believe what they said anyway. We took 1,000 platinum for ourselves. If we took another 1,000 and gave it to The Clasp, that's a lot of money. That two is what I said, yes. I don't know what the deck can do. Could it, could it cause the entire city to crumble? Potentially? Ooh. Why five tho--where are you coming up with these numbers? We give them 1,000 platinum and say that's half of what we took. But we didn't take any more, that's our loot. Maybe we let them know that it's there, but that the guards are coming. They won't have a lot of time. The Clasp or the-- Right, we need to tell her. Honestly, we need to get to Whitestone, speaking of. Yes. Yes. We have ashes to bury in Vasselheim. We have to find out where the fuck Raishan is. Can we see if maybe she went to Whitestone and the whole city's decimated? Just find out if it's all right. Raishan? It was actually him. -It was him that time. - Oh shit. Yes. Emperor Uriel's wife and children are in Whitestone as well. Yeah, that. - Come on! (mixed remarks) Natural 20! - He's good, he's good. - Maybe a necromancer of some sort? Hm, all right. You're brilliant. Vecna is one of her sworn enemies. Rural. So creepy. You know, Raishan did say-- I mean, I know she's prone to lying, but she did say she was from Wildmount. That's where she wanted to go back to she said. Maybe she's studying necromancy, maybe she's been studying Vecna, maybe she's been studying Opash. She knows what it is. - She knows what the orb of death is. - Yeah. -What's going on there? - Gold, right up-- - No, seriously. - Just mouth it, I can read lips. What does that, what does that mean? - I know, what does it mean? - Okay. ♪ -Oh no, I don't know. - How do you make it work? I don't think that's how it works, Grog. Sit down and compliment it a lot. Oh, good call. - Both, both. - So you can fight-- it can fight and he can fight with another thing? (gasping and laughing) -You should give it to Scanlan. - I'm sorry. You don't have to tell us if you don't want to, but please. Of course. Opash. - Terrible necromancer. - Damn, I bet J'Mon would've known. We have a hand to deliver. - Do you think she knew you were scrying on her? Yeah. - We should get to Whitestone. Maybe we spend the night in the keep -for old time's sake. - Thank you for helping. - Nice. - Ker, are you gonna come to Whitestone with us? ♪ We can bounce you back. Samantha. - Should we--just ignore. She has that breastplate. Does Kima wanna come with us? Does everything look like it's in order with Daxio, with everyone here? - Are we good to leave? I look at Daxio, is everything okay, can we cut out-- Will do. - Thank you. - Thank you for having our back. No. - By the way, Daxio... (laughing) I'm sure you're aware, but-- and we'll let Allura know as well--The Clasp was instrumental in keeping survivors alive here in Emon. -They definitely deserve a bit of the pot. - We wouldn't have made it here without them. I have no idea. Where our giant tree is so we can go to our other giant tree. - Just loot everything along the way, like-- - Every person you see. (crosstalk) We'll be back here. - It's all at Whitestone. We have everyone with us. Jarrett, Kash, Zahra. Well, I thought it would a be a nightcap, but it seems like it's a morning cap instead. - Head to the castle, have a drink, -tell Allura what's going on. - Hey, Ker. - Wanna see where we live? He was a dinosaur. Oh, and that flat part of land, that's mine. (laughing) No, it's mine. Thordak is dead. It's not done. - How did you know we were here, Cassandra? Can we roll an insight check to see if it's really her? - I don't trust anybody now. - Twenty-five. - This is just a ruse. - It's not gonna be Raishan. (laughing) Go team. Huh? Do you think this would be my reaction if it was Raishan? (laughing) ♪ Bloody Marys ♪ ♪ Mimosas ♪♪ We need to wake Allura. - This is post bath and we're clean? You have an eighth level spell left? I don't even feel bad that he died now. As soon as he leaves, I come up from the water and go, Ugh! (laughing) I thought he'd never leave! You don't know! You don't know, you're gone! So much liquor. No, bury ashes in Vasselheim. The hand was return the hand. Both, yes. - No. Well, Vasselheim is-- is Vasselheim north-- close to Wildmount? - Oh, well, shit. - Zahra's from Wildmount. Originally, I think. I think she is--when she told me her history, I think it was. Ooh, and the boys! The boys. Yeah, the little angel babies, they're from Wildmount. They're here. - Oh, God, we have Hotis, and the other demon that we fought in the City of Brass. The ambassador to the Nine Hells was in the City of Brass, and we killed him, and he's gonna hate us. - I think so! - Oh, shit! (cross talk) Nice! She has fun buns. Scanlan, you're on my list. Really the rug was the only thing. Do you know anything of him? ♪ Do you? - Right! (cross talk) ...200 years ago. Could I--would I remember this? 'Cause this was remembering information based on a dragon. Okay. It's so clear. Did you find a laboratory on the island? An abandoned one? Right. Thank you. The island of Viscon? That's what Keyleth said it seemed like. I don't know what necromancy is capable of. Hey, K, you remember when I said you were really smart? (laughing) It could be brought back. At least the gem was shattered-- the gem was shattered. - Yes. Yeah, and Thordak shrunk! He was huge, and then he was like normal after that. Thordak? Oh, right. But, 'cause I--will it-- I mean, we lucked out the first time that she didn't catch on. What if she realizes? Okay. - Yeah, you could certainly try. Ker, you should try this wine that Grog got from-- - Just small--small amounts. Don't take a swig that big. - Oh, God, oh, no. - What if he realized something we didn't? How do you feel, Ker? (indistinct speech) (laughing) He likes it-- I think he likes it. But you're still conscious, and that is saying something. I wouldn't drink any more of it, though. Oh, shit, right. Constitutions for days! Keep talking, keep talking. So yeah? - Do we know how to get to the island? Oh, geez! Oh, my God, we need to rest and get there. - Shit, we need to rest! And go! - Okay. Yes. - We need to rest. - We don't have any healing. If anybody dies, we can't come back. Oh! She gets it all back. - No! - Look, we took on Thordak with full health, and we made it out pretty well. Wait a minute, you said you had it left. Scanlan, you said you still had the spell left -so we could-- - Oh, well, shit. Tapped. - Except for her. Oh, my God. - We took them all. - Are there any-- - I'm not, darling, I'm not. Are there any steal-- heal--(stammering) Would you wanna go with us? - Pike is done. She's got two first-level spells left. That's it. I think I've got two first-levels spells left, -but that's it. - Right. - I think we rest and we go tonight. We sleep eight hours, it's only in the morning-- we go as soon as we're rested. That's right. Did it look like there was a lot of books there, Keyleth? Right? - Plus, if she's got 100 books to go through, that's gonna take more than two hours. She might not be fully rested by the time we get there. I can't die again. So Raishan might not have that. I don't wanna fucking go tonight. I don't wanna go tonight. -I don't wanna die again. - We sleep, we go tonight. Let's go to bed. Then let's sleep. - We need your spells to protect us-- you're clutch in a fight-- and without them, you're kind of just a-- a dude. Aww. Don't do it, don't do it, you'll regret it. This is for real, you guys. - Before we go to bed, Allura, any chance you'd be able to join us? I know you didn't get to come the last time. Thank you. Kima did wonderfully. I'm sure she'll want to join us again. No sleeping in, and just go. Oh, geez. - Yeah! - You had a pretty awesome hammer there!
