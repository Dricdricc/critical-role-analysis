And par-ty! Is it you and Gilmore making out? What is it? What is it? No, I want to see it! Oh my god, he looks so dreamy. Solid rock. Which I haven't ever played. But Ivan was telling me about it and it sounds like so much fun. It's so hot in here, though. I didn't get drunk at all. A really hot dragon. I remember thinking he was really cute. I had a thing for General Krieg. I was really sad when it turned out he was-- Super thick? Ugh! When we kill it, we can make armor out of him. No! Nine. Oh, I said I hid at the end of the episode. I said I hid. Are you rolling your special dice? (laughing) Don't be a dick! I can't wait. That was wonderful! Yay! (shouting) What? You can make us fly? Oh, really, but I'm so far away from you. Ugh, I'm not going to be able to get to her. Okay. Will you be able to move forward? Okay. I'm going to send Trinket up to that little alcove. Keep running, no, a little further-- a little further. That's as close as he can get to you. Okay. Get him tucked into that little side. Okay. And then I move forward so I can see him. Right there. All right. And I'm going to Hunter's Mark him! And then I'm going to shoot my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel at him. So that, I'm going to shoot an arrow and it divides into three arrows and they all turn into storm arrows. So I roll an attack for each one of those for my first attack. Okay, so the first one is a 26. Should I roll damage for that one? The second one is a 29. The third one is a 20. 17-- 20. 23 for the first arrow. Nine, ten, 11, 13. 17 for the second one. And then 14, 15, 16... 22. 20, what is that? 27 for the third. Okay. I'm going to shoot through my Blazing Bowstring for my second attack. Yeah, that was just one. 25. I know, it's ridiculous. 16-- 16-- 19, and then an additional d10. So 19 of fire damage. So 25 for the third. For the fourth arrow. And I rolled a 15 for stealth, not that it probably matters anymore. And then I stay very, very still. They're squares. (laughter) Matthew Mercer! You're trying to kill us. No, this is the one that pukes ice. This is what made the dude frozen! Look at this cone you have. Yes! Yes! Freeze the other worm! It does 40 points?! We're going to die! You're going to go past the worm, though! Shit. Thought I was helping. You've left us stranded. We're going to die. Pike is on the other side. Me and Scanlan. Ten rounds?! Okay, can I see him? Can I shoot through him? You can float up to the ceiling and then attack from high. But half of the party is still not able to escape. You're made of wind! Cool. I know, I've got to save you! I know. Okay, all right. Are there any stalactites coming from the ceiling? Okay, I'm going to shoot Conjure Barrage at the ceiling and try to create noise away from us. How about towards the ceiling above the frost worm? Which way could I shoot that he would not be in the way? Huh? God, I don't know. I mean. I'm going to move as quietly as I can around towards that little crevice. Just add my dexterity to it? 17? Okay. Now I want to shoot Conjure Barrage at the ceiling above the frost one. Okay. That is 3d8, I guess. 14 plus five. What's 14 plus five? 19. Seven damage because of the stalactites? I'm going to look over at Trinket, and I'm going to go-- I'm going to go like this to Trinket, and I'm going to shoot another arrow. I can't do the same thing. I'm going to shoot an arrow at the ceiling right above the frost thing, and then I'm going to use my bonus action to hide. Okay. Oh, god. That didn't do any-- Well, I was hitting a stalactite, which is totally still, so it was 13? So just a regular d8. Yep. 11. And then I stealth for 21 points of stealth. Why would you do that?! Why would you do that? You're going to kill her. She would hide! I'm sorry, I didn't shoot an arrow. I just realized I didn't shoot an arrow at his worm and I meant to, and I'm sorry. The one that you're in. Can I do that to her? Just back away from it. So obviously these worms don't even care about each other at all. That is what I'm thinking, we could get them to fight. It's also what? What does it say? Yeah, right? Since you cast it, you could break your concentration? It doesn't matter, it already happened. So you can cancel it if you feel like canceling it. Some people's brothers in the room are at a really low health level right now. I don't know who we're talking about, but some people's brothers-- We're in the middle of a battle. I dropped stalactites on them. So yeah, there's lots of loose rock. Is that the edge of a cliff over on that side? Got it. Somebody's got something of Acid Resistance, though. Somebody has an item. I have it Hunter's Marked, can I feel it? Okay. There could be other worms around. Can you take a healing potion in case he starts to digest you some more? Can you go like that, and get a healing potion and (mumbled) go like that? No, I was further over. I'm going to shoot from my Blazing Bowstring at the icy worm. Yeah, I know. 17? Balls, balls, balls! So I'm going to shoot-- Nope, not going to do that. I'm going to shoot a regular old arrow at him! And it doesn't do anything. It goes right past him, and hits the wall, and he looks towards the wall. Oh, I could have used my inspiration. I should have used it on the Blazing Bowstring one. Everybody's staying! Can I use my bonus action to hide? I do that! Doesn't matter? Then I don't do anything! Go, Pike! Damn you! Dick. Is it sneak attack because Keyleth's standing right next to it? (singing) Purple worm. LAURA & You didn't even get healed! (panicked gasp) That's good, so you can move a little bit. An attack. Well, he will be once he takes his damage. You just killed my brother. Oh no, it's going to get Keyleth. That's a huge radius. Get it, Percy! I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. And I'm going to shoot two arrows at him. Because what else am I going to do? Oh, Pike can help you. I can't tell what happened; Grog went to save you. 29 on the first hit. And 27 on the second hit. Okay. 20 on the first hit. 18 on the second hit. I'm going to stay where I am. Shut up! (laughter) Whoa! That hits, too. Grog, you've never been so hot! Calm down, Grog! Calm your tits, Grog! No! There's gold! There's lots of gold on the other side! Scanlan, you're right there. Get as much gold as you can and Dimension Door over to the teleporter. You're right by the gold! Get the gold and Dimension Door! I need it! Yes! Oh my gosh, get so much gold! I call Trinket and I tell him to get over by the teleportation circle. And I'm going to run as fast as I can over to where I can see them hoarding the gold, because I want to see it. Can I try to get some of the icy armor off of the big worm that's right next to me now? I just want to pull on it and see if I can get some of it. It's okay, I'm more interested in gold anyway. Yeah, we've got to get out of here. Yeah, if we feel anything, let's go, okay. Got the gold? Let's go. Let's go. Teleportation circle. Jeez. He's rolling, he's rolling! Scanlan, run! Oh, shit! Slow-motion turn around, is it a purple one or a blue one? Which is a good amount, I have a feeling. We almost died. Don't do it again. Not in combat. Dr. Dra? Right. That would be smart. What are we going to get-- are we doing-- wait. Here's a question I have. Do we have to give Dr. Dra the portion of what we found down there? Because technically it's not in the house. Technically. So, whatever we find in the house is what we give him a percentage of, yes? Yes? Right, and honorably, it is truthful to say that we didn't find it in the house. Technically, it's across the fucking world. They tried to steal our money, Scanlan, and you're letting them have free rein in our house right now. Right? We found the owner of the house, and he's been frozen. We should take it for ourselves. Just to keep it safe. The house. Yes, Pike, we made a deal for anything we found in the house. I'm not condescending Pike, I am rationalizing this agreement. I'm going to tell him you said that. It's not evil, evil. It's not an evil house. Well, exactly, it's got secrets. We have a house that has powerful secrets in it, that people shouldn't be in. I'm saying we should claim it so that we can keep other people from falling victim. No, we just say-- Keyleth, really? You think that's how you would phrase it? You'd say we heard rumor that the owner of the house had gone missing. We went to investigate and discovered very powerful, dangerous secrets within. We know where he is. He's frozen on the other side of a portal. We need to make sure nobody else falls victim to it. So we close off the house and we say we'll keep it safe. For the time being. We tell him we heard that somebody went missing and we were investigating where he went. What, we have to go through his guard? No. We're part of the council. I think it's a very fair-- Percy? Exactly. I'm not saying it's ours. I'm saying we just make sure no else comes in. Yes, we did. (laughing) That was the lamest slogan ever. (laughs) Lalalala. I stop and I get the golden tea set. And I take off after him. What the fuck was that about? So, you're lying. You're lying, Grog. Yes, you are. We're already out of the house. Maybe it was lying to you. How about this, how about nobody ask the skull any more questions? I don't like evil things in the Bag of Holding. We have lots of weird things in there, I don't know how it'll react. Should we put a cloth over it? Oh, shit. That thing's alive. That is definitely alive. No, no, no. There's definitely something in that stone. It looked at me. Allura? She's not here, she's-- Oh. Just one of us though. Can you transport items with it? You get the wish, Grog, you sure get the wish. That's true. Or me. Okay. I'm going to go speak to Uriel and see if I can tell him what just happened. You can all come with me. No. How about we all go together to Whitestone? Yeah, but then it'll be in Whitestone. No. Why did you run the skull out of the house? I don't know. Maybe the skull was trapped in the house. Maybe it wanted to get out of the house. I think we should hide it and then open it up when we're in front of Allura. Pike? Grog? What do you guys want to do? We can't just count it right here. Away from your friends, but back at the keep. Not at the moment. But we will, once you tell him that we're here. Yes, but we would like to write it down first. Oh, they must have seen him right after you saw him. We heard there was a council meeting. We're here because there's a council thing? Is everything all right, Uriel? An old friend. And discovered that it was, in fact, true. The owner that was missing has been killed. Yes. No, I believe it was built by Krieg. It seems rather old, this portal. I have no idea. Incredibly dangerous. It might be best if we investigate it ourselves. Thank you. No. You all look quite lovely today, and we will leave you to your business. I'll wait for him. Far away. They closed the doors? No, but I thought I could wait in the back of the throne room, out of earshot. Excuse me, handsy. I'm leaving. No, they fucking shut me out. I start chatting up the guards on the outside of the door to distract them a little bit. Scanlan, what are you doing here? I tell some guards on the way out just to block off that house and not let anybody in it. Don't go inside, on your life. Not a lot of troops. Just a couple of dudes is good. Okay. Jarett? Any issues while we were gone? Good man. I pat him on the shoulder. Don't you have your sheriff badge? Call the council. Those guys? They'll make it worse. Don't say that, Scanlan. You've got a cube! Like a sister? You dog! Then you didn't know. There's no part of you that knew you had any children. Just make sure that she knows that you love her. And make sure that she knows that you're there for her. Well, technically, it's still defined by-- You could make a really good move of it by helping her get out of the stockade. Trinket. Scanlan needs help You do a good job of it. Keep drinking that ale. I can stay and count. Ooh, I like it. They do have a range. We're useless. Oh, okay. Out of sight of Zed! Just so you know. I know, right? 1,050. (singing) Knick knacks. And how much in platinum? (whispered) Oh, shit. Oh my god. They forgot to grab their gold. I like them! Oh. I run and check the silverware. No! What about Jarett? He was supposed to be keeping an eye on them. I hate your friends! What about our rooms? Is it just the kitchen that's cleaned out, or did they take everything in the keep? There was shit in there, anyway. They don't know I shopped for everything at Home Goods, so joke's on them. We should heal up and get ready to take this to Whitestone in the morning, yes? Are you going to try to shove it in the lock? It's okay. Scanlan is going to buy all new stuff for our kitchens. Oh, that's okay. You can give her all the gold that she needs to buy new things for the kitchen. You have about a thousand gold because I gave it to you. It wasn't fancy silverware. It was utilitarian. And other things. Or send somebody else, if you'd rather. I'll go. Hi. Oh. Well, why? Yes, of course. I'll tell the rest of the group. We were planning on heading out to Whitestone today, but we can put that off if it's very important? All right. What were you guys fighting about before? Can you tell me? Really? It looked kind of serious. Is anybody in trouble? Can I insight check him? 23? Okay. Well, we will be, then. Yes, if you see my brother anywhere, can you send him home? Thank you. He is so sneaky. I need to train with him more. I go back and tell everybody what he just told me. Right? (laughter) I feel like your room is very secure. Maybe... how many times can you use that little tree thing, Keyleth? Fuck. Yeah, take the stone from his sister and come back. Let her know it's useless after the one use. Got a good idea. What if you go, you don't take the skull, you tell Allura what's going on, bring her back with you through the tree! She's really, really smart! She can go right back, you can send her right back. Well, then you come back-- It doesn't seem tampered with at all, the door? Maybe we should make sure there's, like, fabric over it. You're seriously the coolest guy. We need to give him a raise. Did you find him? Vax! Well, there you are. What's going on? I believe you. Fully. What do you mean? Well, that's a very deep question. No. (sigh) Sit down! Seems like a problem in your mind. Are you mad because we're stealing gold? Are you mad because everybody's running off in directions and you can't keep up? Are you mad because you almost died? Right! That's really all we're doing now, just on a grander scale. Yes, you are. He doesn't despise you. I get ready for the evening. (giggles) Yay! Wait. Wait, wait. As soon as I notice that, I touch Grog and Vax's shoulders and I point up really fast. Could I tell from my favored enemy-ness that it was dragons? No, that was wrong. 23. One black and one red? Can I use my Primeval Awareness to see if it's actually dragons close by? Oh, my god! They were red and black-- of course they were fucking dragons! Everything else was dragons; why wouldn't it be dragons? Are we fighting something now? Oh, hi, dragon, you're my favourite customer. 14. The castle looks really badass. It's just off of camera. Are we really fighting this right now? What's happening? Yeah, no, I think we-- We brought this on ourselves. Jesus! Bad? 20. 20 didn't save? Or go inside. Running towards Keyleth. Okay. I don't know why we're not running inside, instead of away. Are we running? Got it. Okay, I'm going to shout out in Draconic, and I'm going to say Raishan! Is that his name? Raishan! So sorry for whatever pissed you off so bad-- Your fight's with us, not with this city. Leave the townspeople alone. And I take off Yeah, yeah, of course. Oh! Oh! Can I cast something? Can I cast something? I guess I'll do Hunter's Mark on him. I was going to do Protection From Poison, so I might not full dash. I'll Hunter's Mark. I'll just dash. I'm just stupid. (gasps) What about Gilmore!? Where is he? He was right next to us. What happened to you, Percy? Oh god. So we're totally getting in the tree, I know it, we're going to make it. That fuck that was like the biggest dragon ever ever? West. East? He died! He died! To the keep. Get underground. I shout Gilmore! Before I go though. Did this all happen because we went back to General Krieg's place? Did we kill the entire city because we went back to General Krieg's place? Or maybe this was a long time coming and it just happened to time up. You destroyed your whole city, Matt. This is Act Two of the game, of the video game that you're playing. Someone won.
