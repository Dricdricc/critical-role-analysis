Epilsode! They care about that? Yes! I saw! It's so good, Marisha. It's really funny. Wait, are we supposed to be at that? Yes, that's when we-- I can't say. I'll talk to you guys afterwards. Secret, secret. Go check GeekandSundry.com, go to their store, right now, because they're up, and it's so awesome, and I can't wait for you guys to see, we have a Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirt. (cheering) As well as the Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirts, we also have exclusive Critical Role d20 rings, spinny rings. Those are limited, so if you get them, then snag them fast, because they're going to be gone. I think they said they were going to set us aside some, they'd better. Why don't we have them right now?! At intermission, maybe we can grab them at intermission. And the d20, when you crit succeed, it's a Critical Role logo. Just putting that out there. Whatever. Those guys are stupid. This has nothing to do with announcements, but I want to only roll green dice tonight. For Saint Patrick's Day. It kind of counts, Marisha. We haven't actually slept yet, then. It's late. We did? Oh. I didn't know if we camped, I thought we talked. Is Lady Allura here? No. Well, she was on her way to Westruun, and we haven't heard from her yet. Yes, but she knew it. She was going in secret. Wait, there's a dragon there, Kima, a very large one, and she was being very, very stealthy-- We'll wait, Kima. Going in loud will only cause more trouble. She should be here by then. Maybe somewhere safe, like right here-- Yes, the castle. So we're healed up, we are healed, we are not running the risk of dying at any moment, because we've been healed. Right. It's a special occasion. She's on her way to a tavern. Kima's drinking it up. Grog! Kima's drinking it up. It did kill me. According to you. Thanks, Grog. Helpers, actually. They're going to be here for a while. Hopefully. Two objects? What was the second? There was? Oh. I must have missed it because I was dead. That's right. No, actually, a trap that Percival set off is what killed me. What, what, what? What? What? What? So these Vestiges. These leathers, these things. It was worn by one of her champions. The great Purvan. Yeah. I think I like it, but I'll just look at it. It's leather. You choose which one. My armor's acid-resistant, I sort of stole it from my brother. Do you want your acid-resistant armor back, then? He's in such a sour mood lately. What is it? It's like tequila. There's a being, it's a being? Is it a soul gem? But something's already in there? It was buried with-- Oh, that's really smart to give to Scanlan. This is maybe the worst thing that Scanlan's ever held outside of that gun that you had, Percy. It was buried with the Raven Queen's champion, I mean, it could be incredibly dangerous. Or it could be incredibly good, and he trapped it, and they're bad, right? They are so beautiful. I do like feathers. (sniffs) Like (sniffs) must and mold. And birds, really. Yeah, he already told us about it. Well, let me look at my book? You know what I like about this particular piece of paper is that you made it on cardstock so it's extra special instead of the regular paper. I'm talking to Matt, bitches. Okay. I forgot what I was going to say-- Oh, my book! My 30-gold book! Does it say anything about what Purvan fought? Like Trinket. (gasps) Galdric. What? Yeah, what if it touches the thing, and it-- An ally of Purvan! An ally of Purvan's! Is Purvan a good guy? I thought the Raven Queen was not good! Yeah, with these green dice. It's like a Poké Ball! Right? It's like a Pokémon? I think we should do it in the forest outside of Vasselheim. All right, yeah, let's do it. Woods! Okay. Is that close to your family? Oh. Let's do it! All right, sure. Let's do it. All right. What do you think? Good idea? Good idea? We're healed, yes? No, we did, we didn't rest since then. Yeah, we need to sleep, y'all! I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself. But it's four in the afternoon! There's other things to do today. Like find out how Gilmore's doing and see Pike. I'm going with you, yeah. I lean up against the bar, next to you guys. For a couple hours. We saved your life? And the entire town. Ooh, good call. What did you see? Is she all right? Did you see the dragon? Gatshadow? Could you communicate with her when you scry? I don't know how it works. All right. We left word. And told her we were coming here. Yes. If you wait, she'll be here. Drake. Uriel. Gilmore's Glorious Goods. Wonderful place to buy all sorts of products, if it were still... standing. Yes, maybe...? Yes, Tofor...? Which one is Tofor? Yes, Tofor-- they did, I think Tofor is-- definitely maybe here. Yes. Oh. They're not actually here, then. Yes. They're looking for other survivors, Tofor and Asum. Oh, shit, you don't know anything. Thordak! Big. Terrible. Red. Yes, you defeated him once. He escaped the Fire Realm. Actually, Keyleth-- I shut the door behind Kima. I want to talk to you. I would ask my brother, but, knowing him, he would walk away. What happened? Look at me, Keyleth! Be strong! You're royalty. Tell me what happened. I grab both sides of her face and force her to look at me. I'm all right. I'm still here. Okay? I need you to tell me what happened. Because between us? Vax is off. Something's wrong. And I need to know what it is. Yes. How did I get back? Who brought me back? Kashaw, Zahra, my brother. Anyone else? Sit down. There's a bed. Sit down. Percy helped. Like we did with Pike. His wife. Okay. Fluttery words here, darling. Get to the point. Why Vax? Did he get hurt as well? No. What did he do? Right. Well. It's rather suiting, isn't it? Yes. Keyleth? Thank you, dear. And I leave. Okay, okay, okay, okay. (laughter) Foul. That would probably be smart. I'm pretty tired after dying, so I'm going to go to sleep. I bring Trinket into the castle with me, just so you know. It's hard, it's hard. Vax? Is that you? I open the door. Shit. 22. Damn it. And horses. When was the last time you showered, Keyleth? They caught it, that one caught it. Well, I open my door and find my brother falling through it. Oh, good morning. Comfortable bed, I see. Yeah, it's confusing, all these, all these doors. I have no idea. My nature check tells me it's roughly, I dunno, eight? Nine? Something like that. Seven? Maybe seven. It's not like I did it on-- All right. I can't breathe. You're about to kill me again. So-- (laughs) I heard a rumor that you sort of saved my life in a really creepy sort of way. I talk to people. I talk to so many people. I find out things. Secrets aren't safe when Vex is around. Wait, wait, wait, I have a present for you, because I feel like you're going to really like it. Would you like it? I have this armor that I think would be really great on you. Do you want it? It's really expensive. If you don't take it quickly, I might change my mi-- Oh, that was expensive cardstock. (laughter) All right. I love you. Let's get breakfast. Careful, it smells a lot like must and mold and birds. He stole it, what can I say? He is a really sneaky, stealthy kind of guy. Yeah. Fair and square. Where's Pike? We should bring her with us. Can we bring Pike with us? I know she's taking care of Gilmore, but. We need some sort of somebody that can heal, I think we've learned this for ourselves. (sighs) Okay. We learn nothing, carry on. No. The caves. I thought we were going to the-- Primeval Awareness! (radar sounds) I like it. Oh, there's so many things I could sense! Sirens? Sure! Harpies. Six miles! What about if I sit for one more minute and I think if I can sense any giants. Okay. Well, I mean, clear of the things I checked for. No giants. Were they both empty? I don't remember. All right, sure. Cave. Oh, if we stick to the woods, it's my favored terrain. If we go into a cave, not as much. Just barely! Do we have any buff spells or some shit that we should cast, to make us cooler? Aww, put it on, it's useful! What? Yes, dear? What is this? Okay. Breaking hearts left and right? I kiss him on the cheek. Thank you, Percy. Is that a black eye? Huh. This is lovely, I can't wait to use it. Yeah, definitely, let's all surround it and make sure we're not all clumped up. This was somebody's pet, all right? It's probably not smart enough to take control of our minds. Yeah yeah yeah! All right, I like it. It only gets to see Scanlan. I'm going to stealth. Yeah, Scanlan's going to talk to it. Natural 20! Trinket, don't stand next to me, it gives it away. Go stand next to Keyleth! And Trinket's next to you! Trinket, be nice-- oh! (whispers) I'm natural 20! That still didn't see me! Aw. Can I use my perception? Can I sneak? I do get advantage, because of my cloak. Sweet. I'm stealthing! Damn it. 19? Hey, it doesn't? Can I see it better now to perceive it? If I help my brother get on the armor, will it happen faster? I help him put on the armor. Well, you're not the same size as the other guy! He can dress faster! The rustle of feathers. Trinket totally understands you, no? We need to get more t-shirts in stock. That needs to happen. But there is still the Critical Role logo t-shirt available. What is happening? What is he-- Is the ring still available? If the ring is still available, check out our ring! I push Vax forward. (whispers) That's a bad idea for dogs. (whispers) It's gonna bite your face off. Give him some chocolate, man! (whispers) What's his name? TALIESIN and Galdric! I pull out one of my treats I have for Trinket. Wait, wait, Trinket-- This is for your buddy Galdric. Galdric! I throw the treat and say, hey! Whoa, is it good, is it good? We plan on having him help us kill some dragons? Trinket hides very well when dragons are around. Good, yeah! I like it! It'll make the wolf vomit. Trinket goes up and starts eating it. Oh, you know what I have, by the way? I still have, like, a cooler Bag of Holding. That we got from the Slayer's Take. Like, it keeps things cold. Yeah, it's like a little bitty one, but it keeps parts from going bad. Totally! Well, he'll follow Grog, I suppose. I threw a treat at it. I don't understand. Leave it the fuck on! It's really expensive. What, do you want to damage it? (quietly) Fuck, he doesn't appreciate presents. He doesn't have any other armor. I took his armor. No. Tell him not to attack villagers. Do it in a really aggressive way, though, Keyleth. Stern. No, he'll probably attack you. Or he'll bone you. Matt's like, "mm-mm." Yeah, I remember. (whispering) Grog, go stand behind her. Have him guard the village. Just fucking tell him to do it! Protect these lands. (laughs) He already asked that. As long as we need you to. Approaches! Yeah, you can. Awesome. Bye, buddy! Man, that's a cool-looking wolf. What is that? What is that you have? What is that? And we can carry him around and then pop him out. Wait, okay, wait. Is it going to hurt him? Does it hurt him? Is it like, it's bad? Okay, I'm going to try it, and I'm going to try it, and just to see how he likes it. If he's okay with it. Hey, buddy, come here. What was that? Trinket, what did you eat? Don't eat the puke. Do not eat the puke. Come here. Trinket. Do you want to go for a ride? You like rides? Yeah? You want to go for one? All right, sit still. This'll be fun. I don't know how to use it. I point to him with the-- By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you my Pokemon. (laughter) Is he about this size, but I don't like that one, is he about this size? Oh, it's a little crystal? (gasps) Oh my gosh. That's really fun. Okay. How do I let him go? I release you. How was it? Did it hurt? Can you talk to him? You can still talk to him. Talk to him. Ask him if it hurt. Well, that's not good. Ask him how he's doing. Ask him how the little car ride was, ask him if he liked the ride. Okay, would you mind, ask him if he'd mind doing that on occasion, you know, whenever I need him to. Ask him if he cares if I do it again, ask him if he cares. What did he say, what did he say? He looked really cute when he said something. Oh, buddy! I go and hug him really tight and scratch his ears. --vomit on, I don't even care! Oh my gosh, thank you! This is the best, this is the best and we can travel with him, we can climb with him, we can sneak around. I know, it's great! Oh my god. Oh my gosh. Okay. Don't we need to--oh, yeah. We need to check in on Keyleth's family. Grog's family. No, but that's down-- Yes, that's over by Grog's family. They were by Kraghammer. Allura should be here in like a day. She should be here very soon. We should go to the Fire Ashari. (laughs) Do you need some water? Yeah, let's get some meat. Yeah! He does. Put it on. Oh, plate armor, none of us can wear it but Pike. Okay, I have this, which I can't wear. It's a purple and black robe. It was Lady Briarwood's robes. Clings to nearby darkness as you walk. While wearing this robe, you gain resistance to piercing damage. Anybody need pierce resistance that can wear robes? What about Gloves of Missile Snaring? That appeal to anyone? These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them, and when a ranged weapon attack hits you, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your dexterity modifier provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to zero, you can catch the missile if it's small enough to hold in that hand. It requires two, no it just requires one free hand. Yes it does, it requires attuning. Anybody? I feel like that could be cool for you, Scanlan. Oh. And bring them here. Should we wait for Allura then, before we go? They've been there for a while already. Then they're surviving. Wait for Allura, hopefully she'll be here by then. That's next. I've got an opal dagger you could have used. Or in the morning. I have a plan, Keyleth. We will cover the 1,000 gold from our own party funds and have someone here mine some shit for us and give it to us later. Percival, do you have people here who can mine? Looking for work, people--? Yeah, it is. So maybe we should take 1,000 gold just from your family stores then, huh? That might be smarter. Oh, we do. No, that's 500. That was just 500. Just so you know. No, it was just 500. Isn't he, though? (laughs) No, no, no, do something really nice for me. Dear, dear, dear, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Do nice things. All right? You're right. They're taking on so many people. Let's just use the damned party funds for the time being. It's fine, Keyleth. This is a really important feast. All right. What? Just want to make sure we feast right before we leave so that it's most useful. Oh, that was a good night's sleep, I tell you what. Oh hey, good morning, Keyleth! Can anybody else make a feast? That's here? (sighs) I miss Pike. No, I'll cook breakfast. No, I won't cook breakfast. Are you summoning breakfast and then you're sleeping and then we're leaving? And then you're sleeping and then we're leaving as soon as you wake up. Froot Loops! Ooh, ooh, greens, greens! And you're immune to fear, right? Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's walk. Stealth? I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. (gasps) Okay. I put it on a string so I could put it around my neck because it's a necklace because it's cooler that way. It's got a chain on it, so it's around my neck. 30. "So, how are you guys doing up there?" What are you saying? What do they say? Are they nice? Hey, I took your, all right, I'm going to take it. A constitution? Oh, do we get advantage because of the feast? Shit. Come on, jade. You motherfucker! I'm rolling my giant jade dice, because it's green. Womp-womp. Oh, that's a six. Oh, Trinket's in his thing, he's not worried at all. What's up? What's happening? Are we going to, we're going to follow? I walk. I'm pretty tired. You and me. Let's just walk. Thordak. She's kicking ass. I rush forward a little bit to talk to him. Question. Your majesty? I want to help, we all want to help as much as possible, but I don't know any magic. Most of us don't. Are we going to be able to do anything? Well, that I have. Do Scanlan. Do Scanlan. All right. What does a potion of fire resistance do? The same thing? LAURA and Okay. Oh shit. As Marisha collapses in a pool of tears. Yeah, man. You're going to have a headache tomorrow, dude. Aw, we've got exhaustion, Sam. That's balls. There you go. Yeah, so many things! Oh my god, I'm so excited about it! Yay! You guys are hopefully sitting at home being very good.
