Okay, I'm ready. You and your computer, all night. Who was touching my dice? Why were they out already when I got here? Samuel, what did you do? Great. Hey, we got those Electric Beargaloo shirts! You guys, did you know we have a bunch of new items in our shop? MARISHA and There's a retro tee. There's a Mighty Nein Tee. That one has been altered by Marisha Ray, but you can alter your own at home. That's right. We've got-- we don't have that one in store right now. But we have our other shirts. The Nott Detective Agency, case closed. We have hats that are sold out that'll be back some time. Pins. The dad hats are awesome! Well, they're called dad hat. But I wore my dad hat and it looks great on a girl, too. It's metallic thread. That'll be back. I like how we're advertising our hat that's not in stock right now, but there's other things. Go check it out at our shop shop.critrole.com. I know that address by heart! Someday I'll get to Sam Riegel levels. Whoa. Marisha, look! It's your husband. It's so exciting! Not it. Your money! That's pretty good. I don't think any of us have enough experience to help you. Oh my goodness! Ooh, look at your dice! Where did you get those? Those are so pretty! Yes? What do you need help with? Yes, I am very talented. Yes, I am! Have you seen my work? Remember? Well, also I've written a lot of letters. They're really good. Well, thank you. I did have really good tutors when I was growing up. Ooh. I'll use something like Esquire or something in there, that sounds very-- Secrets? I'm really good at keeping secrets. Okay. (gasps) I know about that! That's where Fjord wants to go. Are we writing this for Fjord? Okay! Solstryce, yes, I know where it is. Soltryce Academy. To whom it may concern. Wait. Do I say that? No last name given? Leonard Hyphen? Hyphen what? Leonard Hyphen Leonard. Got it. Got it. (gasps) Vast sums of money. Right. The funds, okay. Oh shit. Now I've got to write it again because you said it wrong. Hold on. No. Mrs. Lavorre, Esquire. The legal practice of Nott? Nott and Brave Law Firm. Okay, Nott and Brave Law Firm. Okay. And then what now? Do you have a seal or something? Because it would be sealed really fancy. You know what? I have my mom's lavender oil. Hold on. Things that are from really fancy places, they always have-- So I'm going to get it on my fingers and handle the paper. So the paper smells like it was handled by someone rich. Yes. We'll do something like that. I use another piece of paper because I don't have any kind of tissue paper. Okay, wait! We need a really fancy seal. We need wax. I bet Caleb has wax. Okay. Do you know where any candles are? Let's take a candle from around the room. And then we'll stamp it with a ring! One of my rings. Okay, which one is the flattest? This one. It's got a rose on it. Well, I have a forgery kit. How do I know if I'm proficient? Hold on. I think I am because of my background. Yes. No. Yes. I don't know. Hold on. I'm opening my-- yeah! Proficiencies and languages. Forgery kit. Why intelligence? Can it be the wisdom? Okay. Plus what? My proficiency? That's 12 plus three, is 15. A really good forgery. Did you see that? It was really trying. Dexterity check? Ten. This is pretty shitty. We need actual sealing wax. I peel it up. Yeah. I'll go to the store and buy some sealing wax. Two silver for this wax! You better be really grateful! Okay. Now I can send letters to my mom with a really cool seal! Boop! You're welcome. Who? Astrid? (gasps) That's the name he said to me when we were dancing. Did you know? Yes, we were dancing. We were waltzing. It was really lovely. He was very drunk. And then he said something about Astrid. Was it his girlfriend? He's very handsome, especially when he shaves. You can see the little butt chin he has. It's really nice. Me too. I run in. You shouldn't call them "arcane copies." They have their own personalities and their own self. You should appreciate them. Well, all right, but I think each and every one of you is unique in your own way and you should really appreciate it! I go back to rearranging the shelf. Bye, Prime. He does have a point there. It's like they were specially made for you, Beau. You have to buy them. I think you should charge her more. I feel like you're a very specialized sort of buyer, is all. Oh, you should give her a deal! I'm sorry. I got confused. Caleb, save 300 gold because we need diamonds. I remember you asking him for incense before from him, I think. Maybe. I can do that for you. I pick up something and throw it across the room. I also might want to buy weapons, if you have a weapon that is also really cool and stuff. Are we going to get it fixed? Or can I still stab people with the broken part? What does it do? Well, I mean, I'll look at it. I don't know. It's pretty broken-looking. Oh my goodness! That's a very exciting thing. Oh, that's expensive. Seems like something you could hold. That's pretty cool. Question. Is there anywhere else around town I could get an enchanted weapon of some sort? But everybody else has really cool weapons, and I just have an axe. How much would that cost? Something that makes me really cool. That would make me hit really hard and probably open wounds that don't close ever, and maybe poison people, and also turn them into candy. Yeah, you know, really bad wounds, also it really hurts a lot, and it makes people turn pink, and also it makes people, like, start dancing and stuff. Seems like a really reasonable price for all those things. What about just one of those enchantments? What about it just makes people start dancing? They go. Yeah, and they can't stop. It's like, it would be really hard for them to stop. Oh my god, that would be so cool! I feel like that would be harder. Maybe I could decorate it to look like candy. I don't have that much either. Wait, do I? No, I don't. How much? Ooh! That sounds way better! Whoa! Okay, I'll do that! Here, take this one. It's an axe. It's a handaxe. Ooh! Yes, it can. Yep! Sweet! Okay! I mean, we should get that, right? Longswords aren't simple weapons, so I can't? Yeah. I'll help you get the cloak. Ooh, yeah, and you would give us a deal if we bought a whole bunch of stuff? Sure. All of us save 20 gold, still pretty good. 25 gold! I'm going halvsies on the cloak with him. Yes, and then another two because I'm going in halvsies on the cloak. With the dust of deliciousness, is that one use, or multiple uses? That's still pretty good. (whispers) Okay, I want some of that, too. Really? Oh. Will you take five gold off of the dust because you like me? That means he likes me! 20! (whispers) I won't. Cool. Okay! Hi! Are you Grace? Deuce. We need to buy some diamonds. Now we need to find some diamonds. Whoa! Both of us, or just me? Advantage! (singing) Investigation. 11. Sorry. Let's go in there. No, we're seeing if it's open. Are you Suvo? I am Jester. Secrets. Whoa! Yes. How many do you have? That sounds like a lot of diamonds. Are they big diamonds or little diamonds? I don't know. Oh, Caleb should be here right now! We can tell they're really diamonds? Well, just making sure she's not ripping us off. Okay. Ooh, that's good. Perception. 20. I've seen a lot of diamonds in my day. There's lots of diamonds right in here. Yeah, so we'll buy all but, you know, these two little ones. Because those probably add up to about 150. Okay. I'll do 300 and you do 300? Okie dokie. Oh! Is there anything else in here? Because this seems like a really cool shop. Is there anything else that I want? Does she just have the sack? The one bag in the shop? (laughing) That's so cool! Wow! Okay. You know what we could do? Get the garlic, sprinkle the Dust of Deliciousness on the garlic, and feed it to the vampyr! Would I know this stuff? A natural one! Yeah, this is true. And we sit there while she pulls out the entire bag. How much is the healing potion? Oh, that's expensive. Wow. I would take it, but I don't have enough gold. Okay. Oh, I did that wrong. It was because I was listening to what he was saying. I was distracted. There we go. Okay. How much for the mask? I know. Ah. Ooh. Three gold! No! Er, seven! Deal. Okay. I think so. Thank you, Suvos. I'm done with my shopping. All of my money is gone. Everybody, be a monk. Yes, really peaceful, actually. Four days later. You see? You know it, too. That means you looked at me because you knew. He left while we were shopping. No! I am not done. Well, because I want to make the Traveler like me again, because obviously he doesn't and that's why he didn't come save me. I'm going to use these two weeks to scout out all of the temples to the other gods and really see the guard schedules and the priest schedules and try to sneak in. I'll probably enlist the help of Nott here. Because you're good at sneaking. This is true. Before we do this, this will be extra helpful for you. Just check it out. Well, imagine it's a lot bigger than that. It does say rouge, doesn't it? Put it on. I bet it changes size when you put it on, because most magical things do. And then we're going to go and try to sneak in and really fuck up-- How much time do we have? What? You owe us nothing! You have nothing! I already fucked with that one. Seems like there's a lot of guards there. Ooh, yeah, let's do that one because it's close to the bathhouse. Well, that's just fitting, isn't it? No, I'm going to do the Platinum Dragon because it's next to the bathhouse. No. What does it look like? We're checking out during the day, you know, like we're visitors. (snoring) (laughter) How often does he come back? And then he gives his sermon during the next day and the next day? We scout it out a couple days in a row to really get the feel for the guards. With advantage because Nott's helping me? Oh Jesus H. Macy. Nine. Nein! Wow. I'm going to take some of the firecrackers we got from Hupperdook, and I want to set them off during his sermon. And then I want to-- but I'm going to Invoke Duplicity, so it looks like I'm actually still there listening to the sermon. Then while that's happening-- but I'm also Disguise Self, so I also want to look like somebody else while it's happening so nobody can trace it back to me. This is really good stuff. And then I want to run over to-- is there a big statue of the Platinum Dragon? This is a really bad time to do this because there's lots of people around. Can I do it at night? Is there less people at night? Would I have learned at least that much? Okay, I come back a second time after setting up the fireworks. Now the next time-- We have to do it right. This time I'm coming prepared with my paints and a mustache. My Anarchist's Cookbook, a couple brochures for the Traveler, and I steal Cad's straw hat that he bought-- sorry-- and, yeah, we're going to make the Platinum Dragon look like a really cool farmer. Yeah, that's what I do. Is it stupid or something? No, if somebody comes in, you need to distract them, okay? Don't let anybody see me, because this might take a while. You're the distraction. I also Invoke Duplicity to where it looks like I'm still there on the outside and I can also be hanging out with you so you don't look like a random person. The old woman that was in the other, yeah. Ooh, no. You know what I should disguise myself as? The sermon guy. Yeah. Get them out. Yeah, distract them and make them go away. You know what you should say, say that the sermon guy, whoever I am, tell them I need some quiet time in the temple. Natural 20, natural 20. Oh, you really should've taken that potion beforehand. Yeah, that one. I come up from behind. No! I step up from behind Nott. Thank you, dear. My assistant did as I asked. I really needed some quiet time alone in the temple tonight. I just hired her. 16? I need some quiet time. No, no. (coughs) No. Scoot on out. Scoot it. That went really well! Right? Okay. You stand right here. Okay. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity. I'm going to make it look like he's kneeling down in the doorway, praying. Then I'm going to run up, and I want to start painting up the Platinum Dragon. Yeah, I climb on up! I start painting. That's a 22. Ooh, you know what? I could just knock this down. That could be really good, too. I start climbing up and I want to paint it rainbow colors. I feel like that would be a really nice addition for the Platinum Dragon. With a mustache. And a straw hat. I drop down and run. 21. I'm still the dragon. (shrieks) And I run. Was there an exit? Looking for an exit. 23. Wait. Say that again. Dark. This is like a Choose Your Own Adventure. How many are there? Okay, I'm hiding in the room. 19. Oh no! Oh no, dodge it! Okay, and when they come in the room-- How big is the room? Oh bejeebies. 5d4? I cast Blink on myself. Okay. Stealthily. If I-- yeah, because I can move like, what, ten feet with Blink? Or can I-- I've never used Blink before! Oh, jeebies. Eight. Goddamnit. Why did you have to say anything? Charm Person! At 3rd-level. How many have I used? Yes, I am. How many are in the room? Three in the room now, right? There are four in there? Yeah, the crownsguard. Okay. 15. Been looking everywhere for him. Can't find him anywhere. Maybe check that room with the candles on the other side of the hallway. Oh no. Five. Can I-- That's 2nd-level, I can cast it. I cast Hold Person. On them. Grr. (grumbling) You're weak, I'm strong. I try to break free. Oh, god! Yeah, I know. What do I add to this? What do I add? My athletics. Sure, it's a 12. Goddang it! Oh! 20! Out the doorway. Oh, no. I take off running. Oh, would I Blink again? Charm Person, 2nd-level! I know. When I Blink though-- I walk in. Slow down and walk up like I heard somebody was impersonating me in here. Have you found them yet? A 16. This was supposed to go much quicker. I'm sorry, guys. I saw your other guard friends running that direction. I think the impersonator was back there. I heard them shouting for help, though. They were really shouting. Shouting for a lot of help. Oh. Shit. Ten. No, I'm still there. Last chance. All alone. Ah! How do I get out of this? Can I cast Dispel Magic on Nott's bubble? No I haven't! I've-- That's good. Oh my god, that's-- what is that, 23? Oh, I might Blink again! Jesus! Seven! Run! Oh shit! Full dash. Full dash? Oh god. 12. Just go! I've got one more 2nd-level spell left. I'm going to cast Mirror Image on myself. I take off running towards wherever the smallest amount of people coming-- I'm using all my 20s here. 12, shit! Do my Mirror Images blink out too? Oh god! Ah! I take off running again. Yeah, right. Oh god, but if I get a double dash, I can get farther away, right? Okay, I'm going to try to double dash. Oh god, okay. Five. Keep running. I drop Blink. I drop Disguise Self. Oh, they can see me? Can I turn a corner and drop Disguise Self? Oh god, I'm not going to drop Disguise Self, then. I'm going to keep going. I want to do it as soon as I'm out of eyeshot for a split second. Oh! Can I Invoke Duplicity? No, I already did it. I get it twice! Yeah! So I want to Invoke Duplicity again. Oh, wait! I have something where I can turn invisible! I just got it! I'm going to use it! Please don't fuck me! I run as fast as I can and turn a corner. Natural 20! I do. I'm going to change Disguise Self and make myself look like a little beggar human girl, and I'm going to walk. Oh my god! I probably should have stayed up on the dragon there. Hi. Did you see what I did? Do you like me again? Why didn't you come? I didn't see you. Yeah. You promise you won't leave? If things had gotten really bad, though, you would have stepped in, right? You wouldn't have let something really bad happen? Okay. I think he looks better now. So many. Which one? We found a lot of relics. Oh, the box? Yeah, of course. I dig into the haversack and show it to him. What do you think it is? He said something about having babies or something with it. I can't remember. What kind of magic is it? So I should keep it hidden? I'll keep it in this pink bag. It's very discreet. I saw a couple medallions for you. Obviously. I was going to ask if I was! I would love that. I, of course, will be the leader of your worship, obviously. I'm writing it in my sketchbook. Will you tell them? And then I'll meet them there? Okay. Wow. Thanks, thank you. Thank you, Traveler. (sighs) I draw so many things in my sketchbook. All of it. Okay, now I've got to go feed the baby. Ah, it was a long night. What are you guys talking about? Oh. Well, I mean, I would have to like disguise myself, but yeah. We could probably go there. Well, I can't go back home. But if you want to go to the Menagerie Coast, you know I'm always on board for that, Fjord. But what about the Academy? Maybe you have to poop it out. It would really hurt, but it could happen. That's true. You never know. Maybe somebody else has already done what you did and they already pooped it out, and now it's in you. Nope. That's true. That is true. That's probably why it was underwater. Menagerie Coast, then? (gasps) You guys could meet my mom! I can meet her; I can see her. Exactly. I will let her know to expect us. Nope, I just need to know it's her. Okay. I send a message to Yasha. Hello, Yasha. I'm really sorry that the last time we left, it was really hard for all of us, but we wanted to let you know that we are probably-- I send another message to Yasha. No, I've got three-- four 3rd-level spots, I think. Four, because of my pearl. So I'm going to send another one Sorry, I got cut off earlier. Anyway, what I was saying is that we are leaving Zadash, and we're on our way out, over the hills, and we're going to go to probably-- Anyway, I get to it eventually. (laughter) Wait, I got to get my handaxe first, so I pick that up. It is so interesting now. Did you want to put a ribbon on it or something to make it prettier? (gasps) What colors? Let's do-- Let's do green. That way it matches my cape. It's really pretty, thank you. What does it do? To hit? Ooh! Plus one handaxe, thank you. Before we leave, can I stop by the Pillow Trove and let them know any mail coming for me or Ms. Lavorre, Esquire, please forward that to the Menagerie Coast by way of Nicodranas and my mom's place? I'm sorry. I'll buy you another one. I'm going to buy Cad a hat. A straw hat, to replace the one I stole from him. Whoa! Wow, thanks Keyleth. LAURA and Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia.
