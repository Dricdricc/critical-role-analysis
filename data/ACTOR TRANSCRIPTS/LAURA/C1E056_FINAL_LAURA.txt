Fallout 4! Shut up! I gotta savor this. No. no, It said small, it said small, Liam! Oh man. I guess the girls get to take advantage of the Skeletor shirts. Do you want to roshambo to see who keeps the shirt? That's so cool! Did anybody-- who all did voices for Street Fighter? Taliesin did-- You do Street Fighter, don't you? So me and Travis will share this one? What? Is there a link in the chat or something, so that-- Yeah, we'll tweet at the break. (laughs) Are we supposed to give it back? 'Cause that's not happening. Come say hi! As Travis says, "Come give us a squeeze." You really are, Taliesin. It's breakfast pizza, man! Oh, you got three vials of Umbrasyl blood, is all we have. Do you want me to write them in the bag? I'm writing the body parts in the Bag of Colding. 15 teeth-- What about scales? What is happening? Yeah, but these would be Umbrasyl scales. This way we can make Umbrasyl black dragon armor! Yeah, yeah, yeah, but we could make dragonhide-- with dragonhide you could make badass armor, right? Oh. Oh, I thought it was infinite. Well, okay, I'm definitely doing that while they're working on the dragon. Oh man! Come on 20! Does this have to do with dragons? Is it an investigation about dragons? What about because I'm in a mountain and it's my favored terrain? I'm just checking for-- I wanna be sure I'm rolling what I'm supposed to-- 13 is all that I rolled, though. Oh, but some of this is Westruun's. It is, it is, it is. You know what, I'm going to keep it-- I'm keeping it in a separate stock, because I don't want to take money away from Westruun-- Well, we're going to put a marker in it and let Westruun know that this is their gold and then we'll send them up-- Yeah, they can, 'cause how else are we going to get it to them? I'm just going to take a little bit of it. What we put in is still down on the ground. I think we should take 10,000. But it's Westruun's money! How much do you need, Percy? Oh, is there platinum in there? We're so greedy! Is it? No, I don't want to put-- I don't want to put more, I want to take less, honestly. All right, but that's all we're taking. These people are in need. It's very hard to say, but I don't want people being homeless and we're walking around with a bunch of gold that's-- Probably. But what are we going to do? Oh, yeah, like a wall or something? That only lasts for a while. Okay. But hide it well. I'll hide the hole so that we tell them where it is. I wonder why he's asking. Lame. Are there any pretty paintings that grab our attention? I could roll it up, Grog, it's not your call! Come on! If you reach your hand in it, can you touch the bottom of it? Oh, what the fuck? Gross! Yeah, but everything's been pouring out but there's still something in the bottom of it. Potions all mixing together? Ooh! Who wants this creepy looking shit? I bet Gilmore would know what that was. What? Ahh! Should we put this inside another glass container so if it breaks, it's okay? The Bag of Colding? All right. Layered gray-brown potion is what I'm writing. Can we read it? It is! Who should read it? I want to read it right now! If Grog looks at it, does it reassemble itself in stick figures? Yeah? Really Scanlan? That's true! You do have a people to rule. Both of you do. How much does the biological bag hold? I could put some in there. I don't have very much in here. It's all light. So 40 pounds? I'll mark that down. It's magic, it's weightless. Was there other things to look at? I'll look at the vial that I have, the layered one. Does anybody need-- Who's shit at climbing? Oh, it's based on strength? Oh, we're shit at climbing! I'm shit. Oh what, these fabulous shoes that fit me perfectly? You think you could do that, like I wouldn't notice you sneaking up? I don't believe it! All right. What about the Bad News? You broke that one too, didn't you? I'm sleeping with them tucked up under me. I'm going to sleep like, you know how little kids sleep with their butts in the air and their feet are tucked under them? That's how I'm-- yeah. Do I notice this happening? Yeah, but I have a really good passive perception, bitch! No, I have the shoes on my feet-- No, no, no. I said I'm sleeping with my feet tucked up under me. Like child's pose, Like child's pose! Yoga, bitch! You know what I'm talking about-- No! Like this. Here I'll show you. Sorry, guys, you don't get to see-- But it's like this, Liam-- No, it's not! (laughter) What?! What the fuck?! Wait, wait, wait. What's happening? Don't attack him! Don't attack him! What? You think I was really going to keep them? But they look so good on me. And your feet are so smelly! Are you-- are you mad? All right. They're smelly, they're really smelly. See? What if--? I suppose I could part with them. Wait, wait, wait. Ahh! I'm not putting them on your feet. No, I am not! But before I do, I want payment, for these boots. What's going on with you and Keyleth? (laughter) What? You love her? You love her so much. Take one, right here. You could put it on, cover up at least one foul stench in the room. Does she feel the same way about you? (gasps) Maybe I will. Fine. Here's your other boot. Servants-- Now go to sleep, we fought a dragon yesterday. (coughs) I spend 15 minutes getting all the flour off of my bed. All right, let's go down. Well, this was peaceful-- I go find Keyleth. Yes. Do you like the hot springs? I do too. I sit down next to her. So my brother. What's going on with you guys? Because I just asked him and he got really awkward. I mean, is it for real? Is it definitely happening? Are you guys "in love?" Getting married? Having babies? Little druid babies? We did. I know, I feel so alive! But we did. So do you like him? Do you love him? That's an answer, you can just answer it, it's not a big deal, you just say yes or no-- Okay, that's not what I asked, though. Don't think about the fear. Think about what you're feeling. (whispering) I think that's a yes. No. You know. I thought I might as well, but here's the thing. We've been through a lot. We face death on a very regular basis. (sighs) And I see the way he looks at you, and I see the way you look at him. And happiness is fleeting in this world; we don't know when it will end. Take advantage of it while you can. And stop living in fear. That's bullshit, Keyleth. Well, you go on. You can't think about that! Well, I wasn't there for very long, but I think there can be. My brother serves Death, Keyleth! This is true! Yes. Yes I do. I think it means that-- I think it means that what we do has a purpose. Regardless of the outcome, there is a purpose. No! Are you kidding? We saved an entire town today! More dragons may come, but for the time being, people are safe, and we are safe. If we are successful, we could save this entire fucking world. You already are. Anyway. Be happy. Go to him. Just live in the moment, don't worry about it right now. We're in a mansion right now. Fucking cannonball! And I get up and I cannonball. All right. I need a higher-- I need a broom! I did. That's disgusting! Cannonball, Percy! How about five pounds of gems? No, but I have it and I'll put it in the middle. Scanlan! Oh Scanlan! Your painting! Your painting is not accurate, Scanlan! Somebody has to-- by your servants. Who's up first? Oh, that's good. Oh shit! Percy. Oh, I'm the only one that's left? It's all right, Grog. All right. I take my broom. I know, right? I fly 20 feet up. As high as the ceiling. How high is the ceiling? I get to the top of the ceiling. All right. I stand up on the broom. And right as I cannonball off of the broom, I release Trinket out of the necklace too so (shouting) double cannonball! 13! Oh, man. I thought that was going to be good. Me and Trinket kind of suck. What is that, strength? 16. No, he's not in the room. Is he stealthing right now and he's actually in the room? Yeah. All right, all right. That is just disgusting. I don't even care. Trinket loves it. Yeah. I just go to sleep and I'll take a shower in the morning. A lot. What abilities? Hmm. What abilities? (laughs) Oh? Well, Keyleth, as you make that awkward-ass face, maybe you should improve your charisma. Yeah, somebody put chicken paste in my bed. I don't know who it could be. Yeah. Weird. What?! Is it just beer? Do you have a jug of mayonnaise now? Gross! No mayonnaise! Oh cool! Oh, that would be good for you. Oh, don't drink it. The other one was a Potion of Climbing, which we decided-- I suck at it, but anybody else can have it. That's true! I don't need it. I have a broom! I've got a broom that flies. Some. Not most. Who has-- This is-- who has charisma-based spells? Oh shit. So if you read for two days and then pass it off to someone else, does it just restart? What did you use it on? How old are you now, Scanlan, if you keep it? What if he gets even more charismatic and then he proposes again? And he charms you more? It's possible. I kind of do want to do that. He is super good at talking to people. Yeah, yeah. I carved a pretty little heart on the side of one of the boots just to make it extra girly. Maybe I do. (laughs) What?! (gasps) I like it. I like it. Oh no! Oh, you took it off? Gro-- (whispers) That's for the people of Westruun! You're lucky he's nice, Grog. Offering all the gold to the herd instead of the people of Westruun. Is our gold still there? It's a good thing I only put a little bit in. (gasps) Oh shit. He deserves it! I knew he was going to go for the gold. That's what he thought he was going to do. I bent my paper. (high voice) 17! Oi, friend. Ooh! Sir, how fares-- (stuttering) How are you doing? Give me the book. Give me the book! What's happening in the town? Are you leaving? Well, we're here. You know that dragon? Gone. Killed. Destroyed. Vox Machina! (laughter) Thankfully, that is not the case. And you are smart, with leaving town. Definitely. Like Care Bear? Are you responsible for these pyres? You're a blacksmith? Armor? Well, the dragon in the mountain is dead, but there are increasingly angered dragons in other cities that will probably be coming here to retaliate. More than likely. Great great? Likes to drink. Oh, that's it? That's true, this one has been plundered. The only other option is-- Split the city up? Set them on different paths? Very quickly becoming noticeable, I think. We have claim to the gold that was stolen. It's up in the mountain. It's just hard to get down. Why do you pledge yourself to him? You do? I've never noticed a twinkle in your eye. No, it's a crusty from the morning. You might just-- yeah. Why not? Can we make it look like it's already been burned down? Can we hide? What do you think, Grog, Pike? We could leave Fassbender here to help protect everyone. How are we going to get Fassbender anywhere with us? Quall's evil. This is true. We did. We did. It's hidden in a cubby with a little mark on it. Oh, yeah, the walk around is important. (groans) Yes, we will tell you about the basilisks. Oh, never mind. So what should we do here, clear out the sewers? Because that's what was said. Did you tell her? Where is she? We should tell her, Grog. There's only about 200 people left. Do you know someone named Amelia? Where is everyone staying within the town? Are they scattered about or are they staying in a central location? An entire city. Let's make our way toward them, then. Can I hang out outside? I want to keep my eye on the skies. Wait, what is that? 32. I come back inside. Pat her on the back. Drunk? Already? Is Amelia awake at this point? Amelia? Well, thank you for everything you've done. I've heard amazing things about you and your family. I sit down next to her. We have to do it right now. So. We knew-- your father is Reginald. Yes. He-- I take her hands. One of the bravest men I've ever had the honor of meeting. I know this can be-- I know how hard this is to hear. But none of this would have happened, none of this celebration would be possible without him. He sacrificed himself, so that all of us could live, and he spoke your name in the end. He wanted nothing more than for you to be taken care of. Would you like to pray, Pike? He hid it. Dear, there's more coming to the town. You take care of yourself. Whoa. Oh. Shit. Why didn't you check up on the earring, dude? (yawns) Where were you? In that endless jug? Or does it only make beer and mayonnaise? Is it saltwater? (groans) Damn it, Grog. We should probably call everyone in the town to talk. Is there a bartender or somebody that's running the inn that everyone's staying at? Or is it kind of makeshift-- Can I grab someone nearby that looks like they're up and about and actually accomplishing things? Dear heart, um-- Could you spread the word that there's going to be a town meeting? So we can talk about how to keep everyone safe, dear. Yes. As soon as possible, can everyone meet here? In the center of town. Where the goliaths, where the barbarians-- sorry, Grog-- where all the mean people were. All of us? Sweet! Thanks, Kiki! Who wants to talk? Scanlan? You're so charismatic. I think we need to ask them where they want to go. This is true! Pike? They know you. Help them take shelter in the sewers. If there's danger. Can we ask before we go up on the stage if Kerr, if you're willing to help, should they want that? Is that something you could help us with? How far away is Kymal? Was that in your book? Your daughter's in Kymal? Well-- That would be terrible. And Pike, do you want to step up there? Woo! Good leadership! (laughter) Huzzah! That was Divine Intervention, I thought. It was, like, a thousand gold? (in alarm) No, no, no! But I don't want to use up all the-- we can do that after things are-- Just the bunker-- No. It's fine. Bunker it is. Do you see her? Yeah, that one. And the giant bag of gold. It's not us, Keyleth. It's the history of the town. Perk up, you're driving me crazy. (laughter) (kid voice) That's a shark. This is a flower. It's a couple days. That would probably be smart. I'm going to stay and help build. I'm just reading these names on this wall! 21. I pretend like I don't hear them. I love you too. That's worth more. Did I? (laughs) I saw this little lump squirming. I thought it was probably you. Tiny little you. Oh, ow! One day at a time. Ow! I would like to pull Kerr aside and say, you know these people here, they're a bit lost, and they need a leader. I'm looking at one that would be wonderful. Just something to think about. Oh, the white iris. No big deal. It's the white iris. I just take a little piece of chalk and I add Trinket right on the other side. Almost perfect. Almost perfect. Vasselheim is so far away, and the Feywild is so very close. Well, I'm going with you, too. Vasselheim? I've been there. Well, then I'll go to Vasselheim and I'll wait outside. To Vasselheim, then. That's fucking stupid. I'm going. I wouldn't let him go to Vasselheim. No. No, we know an entrance to the Feywild in the Frostweald. No. I pull Grog aside. Fine. Thanks, Kerr Bear! And thanks, Loot Crate! I'm going to look it up. Plus there's a link in your Twitter account, right?
