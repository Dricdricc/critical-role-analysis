What's been happening here? We don't run. But maybe she knows more. Have you done research? Why are you here when everybody else has fled? Oh, Jesus, really? I rolled a one! Natural one! I'm trying to pull my foot out of this muck. I can't even see what's going on right now. I spin around. What the what? What are you attacking?! Oh! It's a wraith! That's beautiful. Gah! Kaulder! Thank you! I think Grog was next, he had 17. Why?! That's major! I see what it's doing and I Hunter's Mark that wraith. Oh no! I'm so excited. Oh jeez, that sucks. 12. I'm going to do it again.
