It's so hard! Why are you guys so fast? Oh, shit. They are. Hey look. World of Warcraft pins. Oh, look! It tells you how to do it! Transform your crate. I don't know. Oh my god, into a mallet. And I think if you wear glasses, this shirt is 3D. No, I'm making that up, but it would be really cool. Ah, legit. There's more! You missed it. Yep. Minus one Ashly Burch. No. Don't say that! You haven't? Oh! I rolled two 20s in my pre-rolls. I don't know! I like it. Thank you. I appreciate that, DM. Hi! My name is Devan Bluebutton. I spit as I said it. I'm a halfling! And I'm a sorcerer. Sounds like a lot of thought went into that. Oh! We got music! I'm so nervous! What's going on out there? Oh, okay. Have you heard anything from Shenn? Oh, you're so kind. I think if you brought me anything they might catch on, though. I worry about you, too. I think the sooner that we can get to the house the sooner we can end all this. I would love to. Ow, it hurt when you hit me a second ago. (scared sound) Okay. Thank you. Now? She is a shrew. I'm not going to run anywhere. Already? It's not trapped! Siggle? (gasp) I wonder if it works the way it does upstairs. I pull out my dagger and I cut my hand with it. And I stick it on there. Anything? Thanks! Thanks. I am useful! Also, I cast Dancing Lights and throw my torch on the ground. See guys? Why do you need another torch? Huh? Okay, but I've got lots of light, though. Oh, I send one of the dancing lights in with her. I send another dancing light in. You're welcome. And the thing goes (spinning)? So it's a door. Oh! Oh, well. Yeah, well. So you know, gambling, huh? How fun is that? But sometimes it gets you into trouble. And sometimes you can't pay off all your bills. And sometimes your grandma has a lot of gold and some treasure. And I said it and the Clasp heard me and now I'm stuck with you guys. But I'm totally on board and I'm real excited to help you out and be free of you at the same time. Sure. 17. I'll be behind Dren then. Yeah. And three dancing balls of light. Can I ask a question? Cantrips. How many do I get? I just can do them? This is amazing! Make it hail, baby. All right. That's gold coins. Go down the hallway. It's 120 foot range. Come back! As we're walking, can I make the four lights combine together, in the shape of a human, all the way down at the end of the hallway? Yeah, it makes a humanoid form, yeah. It says you can, into a vaguely humanoid form. Yeah. Okay. Down at the end of the hallway. Four. Is it behind us too, or just in front of us? We could back up? We could just back up, then. That's not smart! I'm the only one that can get you to the actual thing that you need! While she's looking at it, I'm going to send a message to-- --to Dren. No one else can hear. I'm going to say Hey! I'm thinking they might be catching on to something, so maybe it would be smart if we pretended that we didn't like each other a little bit more than we have been. I know, I like you so much! Yeah maybe a little mean so they're not catching on as much. Oh no! That was maybe a bit too much-- Yeah? Yes, I do. Nothing that'll work on these things. Holes? On this trap? I can try casting Ray of Frost on the tile and freeze it in place. I mean, it might work. I can try it. But Tarvis, in doing so, I might actually hurt your foot. But I don't want you to blame me, because I'm just doing it because I'm trying to freeze the thing. That's really smart! What? Do you want to pick me up? Because I'm short. She's also pretty short. Thank you. As we go, I hit a Ray of Frost. Okay. Shit! Am I on his shoulders at this point already? Fuck! 19. It might be smart, you guys, to keep looking for little tiles, because my grandma's really paranoid. Better than five! Oh, Obby, that only works with people that are related to her. Well then keep trying! I loosen up the cut that I already dug in. Ow. Shit. It might not work. Hey! See? Here to help! No, it doesn't. I don't think I've ever been down in this room before, but we've got to be close to the basement! Well that's where she keeps a lot of her treasure. Yeah. Do I roll against it? I rolled a six! Ew. So foul! Yeah! Believe me, if anything starts happening here, you should hide, because her magic is really powerful. Terrible. So you know, this thing-- have you heard of gambling? Yeah, it's really fun, right? So I took some of her money to do that. That's all. I don't know! She has a big room of gold, I just took some of it. I really don't know. That's what I mean! But she might keep the emerald down there. Yeah, it's in the basement. Uh-huh! Ooh! Can I go over and look at them? Oh no, we're halfling! This is the one that got me killed, so I don't know if you want to roll that. Yeah! No, no, it didn't. Natural 20. Ooh, are we doing this? I want to investigate them too! Seven! We suck. That's pretty cool. I start heading towards the exit of the room. Sure. Just make sure I can still use my hands. Why are we going-- sure. This is a storage room! The rest of her stuff is in the house! Yeah, this is not the basement! This is a storage room! Yes. Right, I came in from the other way. Where's the other way? Well yeah! This is the basement. Gold! I think so! Do you want me to grab some gold to show you it's fine? We're not here for the gold, but sure. And I pick up some gold. I knew there were more than before! Oh no! Can't I dodge out of the way? Can't I dodge out of the way? Ah shit. Oh no! Oh no! Oh my gosh, I don't even want to roll that one again. That was so close! Oh god! That's a lot! 20. With my hand stuck in it, I set my hands on fire and cast Burning Hands. That's a good question. Just roll? Oh come on! Oh wait, can I reroll ones? On the damage, no. I don't want to use a sorcery point yet. Four on 3d6. Two ones and a two. Like the worst. Does it let go of me? Oh wait! Ugh! I don't know. Ugh. No, I'm good. They're on to us. Oh no. Could I have tried to wiggle free? Could I have tried to break the grapple with my turn? Is that possible? Should I have tried to break the grapple? Ah, my hand! She doesn't care. She wouldn't care if she did. Oh, by the way, it's on fire now. It ignites anything on fire. You could dance around the back of him. Yeah totally, you roll. Roll a 20. Oh, that's good! Plus six, so 20 is the attack. So d6 plus four. Ooh, eight, and then two more d6. 13. Demogorgon! I'll feel real bad if I just fucked everybody up. Ooh! Scimitar? Can I pull my hand out? I'm so weak, though. Natural 20! (cheering) That is my action? (sad trombone) Okay, yeah, I will try to move away from it. I don't want to waste the spell; I don't know! I'm going to Misty Step next to Tarvis. Oh, it's an acid creature. Plus five is 20. Nah, it doesn't work on the damage rolls, but that's okay. Plus three, so four and then 2d6. So 14! Are you okay, Tarvis? Okay, I'm going to hop up over the chest right there. Well, I'm going to Ray of Frost the big one. Yeah, I'm going to get a little closer, yeah. On a hit, so I make a ranged spell attack. But I don't know what my-- Ten. Yeah, I hop up on a chest behind me. Ooh a d12, it looks like a ball, it's the other one that looks like a ball. We're rolling like shit! It's not dead yet, damn. I'm going to hop down from the chests, the other direction. The ones that Tarvis ran his swords over, can I go see if any of those are mimics? You said one of the locks got busted when he did it, can I open it up? Electrum? I want them. Do I have anything on me that I can dig in? I take my cloak off and I dust it in there to see if it bites at it. I don't know. I'm going to keep looking at coins. Good job, guys! That was really scary, I'm sorry about that, Tarvis. I insight check him. I know he's full of shit. Can I insight check him? 17. Insight. So I know if he's full of shit? Were you lying or were you telling the truth? Yeah, I'm okay. Wow, sorry I did that. They've never been monsters before. It's just been actual chests of gold. What chest? Which one? All of them? Gold! Oh, it's electrum. Yeah, it's not as good as gold. It's like a nickel to a quarter! Do you want to kill me and you'll never get the--? Do you want to kill me? But maybe she's keeping the jewel in one of the chests. Maybe the mimic has the thing inside of it! Is there a big emerald in there? Is that the stone you're looking for? Sure! Oh. I don't think this is the one. It really would be smart to look. I'll search the room for the jewel. Yeah. 11. I pocket as much as I can. Shit. Six. Damn it! Aw, come on! Really nice, awesome clothes. Damn it! This was worth a lot of money! Can I look around the room for the rat symbol anywhere? I was looking for the jewel before. Oh! Natural 20! Damn it, what a damn waste of a 20. This is the basement. This is the basement. Upstairs. You know, the entryway, and then-- Well, if it's not in here, the only other place that I can think of that it would be-- (groans) Is down the hallway. It's upstairs. Up-up. Well, yeah. I mean, it's the basement. Where else is it going to lead? It leads to her office. Yeah. Does my grandma like dogs? Yeah, like, well, I mean not that I know of. Why? Well my grandma is really paranoid. Sure. I don't know why you want to check a desk. I mean, you're looking for an emerald, right? A big fat one? Me? Okay. I would have to roll, like, nothing, because-- ten. While they're looking at that, can I look at the big book in the room? I don't know. Halfling. I think the pillar probably supports the room. What do you want me to do? 18. Are there any keys? She's a sorcerer. Just like me! Only stronger. Look, you guys want a jewel. You have me here. I don't why you're not listening to me. It's going to be upstairs! Yeah, but those weren't there before, you know? All right! And I walk towards the-- The hall. The room. Can I lead them there? Should we? Do you trust me? TRAVIS, SAM, and Do you want a jewel? TRAVIS and Do you hear dogs? No. This is a hall, though. Do you want me to send some lights down the hallway? 19. The foyer. (whispering) Do you hear any dogs? I don't know, probably a guard. It's been ten years. There's a library on the right. And then on the left is a little sitting area. And then upstairs-- It's been a while. So unless she rearranged, upstairs-- No. My mom, she split. My grandma took me in. She was a horrible person though. Couple years. I know. She doesn't even pay attention to how much is down there! It's ridiculous! Thank you. Is her bedroom upstairs? Okay. So my bedroom used to-- And then there's this room. I mean, it could be in there. I'm thinking it's probably in there, because there was this cabinet that I never got to look in. I feel like that's where it would be. In the funroom. Then upstairs from that is my grandma's bedroom, which I guess it could be in there as well. Oh, because that's where she keeps all her magic stuff. Where are we going? Yeah. Delweth, do you want me to cast some dazzling lights? What? Here's the thing, Delweth. I don't know why we're not friends. I mean, I didn't really do anything to hurt the Clasp. In fact, I'm just helping you guys! I mean, that's pretty innocent, really. Oh, really? Right. I think we will! We'll be friends afterwards. Okay. They go to the same place. (groans) 13. Yeah. Is that seven? This is the magic room. Upstairs is my grandma's room. She wouldn't have kept anything of mine. I don't have anything in there. She probably burned it all. No, no, no. I would say I was one step down from the cook? No-- I mean she taught me some spells, and I do Dancing Lights, see? Just this is one. I take it away. She taught me some stuff. I take them over to the room. There's nothing in here! *NSync, thank you very much! I send a message over to Dren. How are you doing? I mean, are you okay? I know, I feel like we don't even get to talk any more. Oh, well, it's kind of embarrassing. (laughter) No need for violence. She does not give a shit. Just a guest room and then the funroom. Oh, that's pointless because I'm going to need my hands. If you want to get through the funroom, I'm going to need my hands! Ow! That really hurt! Too late. Way late. I remember. I remember a shield. There's a very specific thing we have to do when we go down this hallway. Well does somebody want to go over to the shield on the right? Lift it up? No? Bring it back down. Pull it down. Shit, I think I'm doing something wrong. No, it was the one on the right. No, there's a second step. Can I look around, do I see a wall sconce? There's no wall sconce? In the corner? Shit. She changed some stuff. No! You still need-- The wall sconce is hiding behind these books! Well I remember my grandma did some stuff, and things happened, and we had to do things in a very specific order, but she also said-- I don't know, these are so tight! I don't even know how my hand came out of it. I also remember her saying not to touch anything. Don't touch it! I keep looking for a wall sconce. Obby, when you touched the shield did you hear a click? Did you hear anything click? Let's look for the wall sconce! You pull out a wall sconce, yeah. Yeah. Do we see anything? A wall sconce. Well, yeah! It was right there. No, there's more to do! Sheesh! Can I walk down the hallway? Can I look for traps as I'm walking down the hall? Eight! (gasp) Okay! Do I see a bowl? A plate anywhere? A bowl with water in it? No, don't touch anything! I send a message to Dren-- Are there any wall sconces up top? But we can avoid the gravity scrawl-- Keeping an eye on the ground for any more of those things. I think she might be into some creepy shit. Don't pick up anything! Don't touch anything! Seriously. Through all of this have we seen a wall sconce? I rolled a three as well! Oh shit! 19. Oh no! Plus six. Can I do anything? I'm going to die! Just all of them. 19 as well! ASHLY and Can I do anything? 24! Seriously?! Okay. I'm going to cast Chromatic Orb. Well then, I'm going to use one of my sorcerer points to do a subtle thing, because I can do it without any verbal components. Okay, I'm going to cast Chromatic Orb as a thunder attack. Can I try for a movement to wiggle my hands out, because it's kind of loose? Oh, shit, balls. What was the first one? Was it a ten? 11. Come on! Wait, no, I still get to do something! I'm going to try and swim forward and start kicking against the glass. Technically, did I have to waste a sorcerer point for that, since I couldn't actually do the spell? Ten. Not yet. Wait! Can I try to get my hands free again? At disadvantage. Come on! Five. Okay, I kick at the crack. Can I at least kick at the crack? Sucks. I can't-- It hasn't reached that spot yet. Oh! Wait! Okay, wait! Oh, this is stupid, because I feel like I'm about to be free, but I wouldn't know that, that's metagaming. Can I see that there's a crack in it? All right. Then I'm going to cast Misty Step and get out of the box. It's a verbal, so I would use a sorcery point. I've never been in this room. Yeah. And I told you guys to look for a wall sconce, and then you marched me down the hallway. Gulp, gulp, gulp. Ow! Should I roll or does she roll? That's great! There's a door that opens if you do the right things, and there's-- It's there! The room! Jesus, Tarvis! It's really a sigil, it's not actually a "siggle." I really don't understand why you don't want me to have my hands. What are you afraid I'm going to do? I don't think it works if I'm not free. I'm trying. I can't get my hand on there right. Look, I can't get my hand on there right. I can't twist it around. (whispering) I'm trying real hard. Can I have a haiku? I feel inspired. I didn't know you thought I was your friend, that's great! I'm trying. I'm trying. Seriously, while this is happening, you guys, I don't understand why you think I need to think I have my hands tied. You guys are the sneaky ones. I'm just here to help. I'm just here to help! Mm-hmm. I don't see anything. I'm facing the wrong direction. Yep. (laughs) I think she would like you a lot. I don't know. There's another rat over there. I don't know. While he's doing that, can I message Dren? We're in the doorway, right? I want to message Dren, and say, I think the jewel is in the cabinet on the other side of the room. On the other side of the room. Just remember-- These guys are tough. I think worst case scenario, we should get it and go. I don't even know! Loosen the ropes. See if you can loosen my ropes. While she's holding it? Jeez. Oh, that was a good one. So roll it again. And take the lower. They were the same! Yeah! They were both 16. No no no no, they were both 16. If it is, her voice has changed. Dogs! Dogs! Shit! No! I cast Minor Illusion. Of my grandmother. In front of me. 18. (laughs) There is it! My arm? 11. What spell? I didn't get to cast anything. Try that again? I'm going to try Minor Illusion. And make it look like my grandma now behind me. In front of me. Oh, it has to be an object? A sound or an image of an object. You're right, okay. All right. All right, then I'm going to cast Chromatic Orb. Wait! Yes. Yes, I'm going to cast Chromatic Orb at the dog that's biting me. And I'm going to do-- Oh, so I'm going to do it at the big dog attacking Tarvis then. And I'm going to do it as a thunder attack. That probably doesn't hit though. What's my spell? Oh, okay. So that's what I rolled. Ten. Oh. Nine. All right, I'm going to back up behind-- who's next to me? Delweth? I'm going to stand behind Delweth. Yeah. I'm going to dart under her legs. 11. Ow! Yikes! All right, I want to like stay under her legs, basically. Yeah. Its blind eyes? It's blind? Oh. I don't know anything about it. Yeah. That's good. Roll plus four. You didn't add that four. So it's 12 total. No, but I was hiding! Oh shit. Oh god, we're going to die. What? Can I run around the room? (laughing) Yeah, I'll scoot under Delweth's legs. I know that they will, but I don't really have another option here. If I move, can I make it across to the doors? 25. I don't know. (laughter) Then I'm going to-- ugh! Burning Hands everything in a 15-foot cone of me. Okay. So they must make a dexterity saving throw. I really don't have it written anywhere on these sheets. I have the page! It's a 14! I really have only been looking at these three. Okie dokie, here we go. Ooh, 13! Get away from me, you bitches! (screaming) Tarvis! Tarvis! 13. Oh, but can I try to-- no. Will I get hit if I move now? There's a little one next to me? I can't see what's next to me. I'm going to run away from it. I'm going to run under Gelweth's legs. Yeah. Oh, under Gelweth's legs. Delweth's legs. I don't know why I keep calling her Gelweth, I'm sorry. It's a good name, Gelweth is a great name too. Yeah! I didn't get to take a potion as my bonus action. Just the greater. Yeah. Ooh, nice. You can cast it on all of them? No, it's not a beholder. Is it a beholder? It looks like a beholder. A little beeby beholder. No, there's nothing around it. Oh no, it's coming down! He'll get an attack of opportunity on you, the one next to you, if you move away from it. That's your bonus action. Yeah. It is a baby beholder! Aw, little buddy got hurt. Me? 23! I'm okay. Come on! Why are you being a dick? I'm going to Burning Hands him because that seemed to work so well before. Ten! (panting) And I'm going to run forward toward the doors! And while I'm running, I'm going to bust out my other-- oh wait, if I get to the door can I bonus action it? I'm going to take another potion! Ooh, nice. Plus four. I killed two things. Halflings. Ooh, you could bitch-slap the baby beholder. You can't, I'm a halfling. You can't hide behind me. Okay. Can I turn around? Do I see the sigil on the doors? I want to open my hand and stick it on there. Shit. Okay. I'm going to try casting-- damn. Chromatic Orb, man, that's my longest range attack. No, I've got two more-- Yeah. So I've got one more. Oh wait, did I forget to mark off a Burning Hands? I did two Burning Hands? Okay. And I did another Chromatic Orb. So yes, this is my last first level. Okay, yeah. Okay. 24. I really want to do a thunder attack on somebody. Thunder attack. Yeah. So that's 3d8, man. 24, man. No, wait, I did my math wrong. 22, man. And then I'm going to hide behind Delweth. Because I'm smaller. 17. No, but I was hiding! Can I cast Minor Illusion and make the sound of more dogs barking on the other side of the doorway we came in at? And I try to open the cabinet, yeah. I cast Minor Illusion and I cast another big emerald next to it. I did, too. I don't know which one's the real one. Don't put your hands on anything! I grab the emerald. Yeah, the real one. I try to pass it to Dren. Here, you hold this, I'll try grabbing something else. And then I try grabbing something else in the room. Okay. I cast Mirror Image and I-- One. That's my passive perception is 11. 13. I cast Mirror Image. That creates three other images of myself. And I take off running. I run straight forward. Yeah, but all my mirror images are going to run different directions, so he won't know which one is me. Oh god. Wait! No! If I roll a d20, I determine whether the attack hits me or another one of my duplicates. (gasps) Oh shit. Yeah, wait, I have to roll a d20. If I roll a six or higher, then it attacks a duplicate. The duplicate's AC equals ten plus my dexterity modifier, so 11. So it would've hit it, but that's if-- Whoa, if I roll a six or higher and I rolled a six. So if an attack hits a duplicate the duplicate is destroyed! Oh jeez Louise. 20. 20 as well. Oh no, you aimed at me. You hit me. Okay, seven damage? Would I have any idea how to actually get out of this room? Do you have the ledger in your hands? Should I? Oh my gosh. SAM and It's my turn. I don't have any idea how to get out of this room. No, I really can't. Oh god. Okay, I'm going to use two more of my sorcery points and get another level one spell and I'm going to cast Color Spray at the three of them. Color Spray is a dazzling array of flashing colored light. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from me. Is there any way to get all three in the cone? Yeah. Who can I get? Okay, I'll get them. So I'm going to roll 6d10. No, no it doesn't do that. And then it makes you go blind if I get you, if your hit points are low enough. Three? You have three hit points? Yes, so that's one, two, three, four, five, so I have one more. That's nine plus nine is 18, (counting) plus nine is 32. Yeah. Yeah, it was your turn, it's your turn next. Okay. Natural 20! Does it sizzle near the sigil? I have 11. Wait! Wait, no, I still have mirror images! Yeah. It's a seven, so he still would've rolled for an attack on that. Yeah, and I rolled a seven. So one of them disappears, there's only one mirror image left. Damn it! Damn it. He hits the mirror image! No, 8d4. The mirror image shot rainbows from its hands, too. No, they're still blind until their next turn. It doesn't matter, I'll take care of her, I have a lot of magic. I would never! No, I did not. No, I didn't. Delweth, you said you would protect me. She told me she was going to protect me. Aw, man. While she was talking, can I have tried to pry open the hatch? Aw, come on. I'm going to die. I've got like a human head inside of my shirt right now. Oh, Dren! Oh, god. 13. I'm going to put my bloody hand down on the floor underneath me, and I'm going to cast Minor Illusion. Oh, god. And I'm going to cast an image of the ledger across the room, like over towards the-- I mean, the emerald. The emerald rolling across the floor towards the door. It can't move? I keep my hand with the blood on the sigil on the ground. I don't know if it's doing anything. Shit! I guess then I'll do Ray of Frost up at Obby's face. I'm going to use a blue one, because it's frosty. That would be 31. No, wait, no, that's a lie. That's such a lie. 23. So that's 1d8, then. That's three. That's it? And I say, look! Look! The jewel is yours! Why are you still attacking me? I don't even want it! That sounds smart. Me? That hits me. I go unconscious, but then if they keep hitting, I get three death saving throws. This is it! Zero. All I did wrong was play some poker. Just saying. You know it in your heart of hearts, Obby. All I did was play some poker. No, I've got one more death saving throw. No, it's not, it would've gone away as soon as I died. You could give me a healing potion and wake me up. Wait, I didn't get to go? My turn was after Dren's. Just kidding. I had the lowest, I forgot. 11. You're going to rapier? I'm back to zero. It doesn't matter, I'm back to zero. Well that's two death saving throws gone. He's terrible. It hurts, I don't even-- like, we've only had a one-shot and it still really sucks to die. I'm dead, yo. My body. My sad little teeny-tiny halfling body. Is she? Oh! What's up, motherfucker? One! That's so shitty. Oh god. He's terrible. I had the baby finger pipes on my body. Jesus, pull some fucking levers! Oh man, if I'd grabbed that lever when I was in there grabbing that big jewel. The Shrew. All that work. You were trying to kill him? That's so sweet! I was going to fucking betray you. (yelling) But I didn't want to! He made me! I didn't want to do it! I even asked him, I'm like, can I choose not to betray her? That was awesome. We're all assholes. You done good, bro. Oh boy, Harley Quinn!
