I didn't have it! Hello! Die die die. Oh yeah! Why is he leading Scanlan, what's happening? What are you doing? What is happening? I'm so happy to be here. (all laugh) Okay. Okay, I get ready for that. I don't have my stuff with me. Oh, I think I got like a 21. I got 16 plus-- No. I got jack shit! We're in the war camp? We have to run down in? What was your initiative? I guess I'll hold, I'll hold, to see what the hell's happening. Plus two 'cause you're raging. Let's go down at the same time. Oh, I rolled really bad. I rolled a two, but I add it to my acrobatics. Which is like, I bet. Yes. Yes. I wanna do Lightning Arrow on the guy attacking my brother. Yeah. Ugh, I don't think I hit. I had rolled a four. I Hunter's Mark him anyway, just for future stuff. That was a bon-- Oh! So I get a regular attack now? I get it. (all laugh) That is mine! I'm sorry. I roll 14. I think it was 1d8, actually. Ten. Oh, yeah, that hits for sure. That-- hits. 13 and what? Wait, that guy behind you though. Oh no. This is gonna be bad. Perhaps we should tie him up. Hugging him with vines. 19. What the fuck is that? No clue, good times. (gasps) Oh, so. 22, 21, and 14. I was doing his math. (all laugh) I back up a little bit. Yeah, like that. And I'm gonna cast Hail of Thorns on him. Right? I'm gonna shoot like a regular attack. Yes. Okay, good, then that'd be 18. Yes, so I was casting that as a level three spell. I roll 3d-- that means I roll 3d10. Against 14 which is my spell level thingy. Yeah, 1d10 for damage. That is an eight-sided dice, yay! An eight. I get another attack, so I'm gonna do that. Natural 20! (all cheer) Double the dice. 15. Roll it on the table, that doesn't count. It did? Oh my gosh. He's in the mouth of the thing. Oh no. Are you still unconscious? You only have three chances if you roll, fail, three times, you die. Clarota! The general's? 21. So that's 40 on the last one. So 61, 76. I want more chicken. Oh seriously? Especially today. What a time to join the game.
