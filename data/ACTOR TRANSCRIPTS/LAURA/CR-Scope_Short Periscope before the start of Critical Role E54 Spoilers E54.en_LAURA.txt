Roll for jelly beans! The buttered popcorn, combine it with the s'mores one, or the root beer, or the cream soda one and it is delicious. No I think, wait. Chocolate pudding, buttered popcorn, and marshmallow you can make a s'more and it's delicious. Stop it! LIAM and That was a good one. Oh, I like it! I haven't sorted out my dice for tonight yet, but I've got this gold one. In fact, I've got two gold ones. They're so fancy. I've got this little bitty one of amethyst. No! Inside of my bag that I sort through. This is just one of the bags, just one of them. Here's my Hail of Thorns one. I was aiming at Travis! I'm so sorry! I know! Anyway, which 2nd-level should I take? I think it's going to be Spike Growth because I had that for a second and I liked it. Well, I leveled up and I realized when I was going through my stats that I had all these spells that I could've learned that I never learned. I had a level one, a level two, and a level three spell that I never learned! So now I get to pick those and add them to my list. Little arrow barrettes? No, I love my little Trinket barrette!
