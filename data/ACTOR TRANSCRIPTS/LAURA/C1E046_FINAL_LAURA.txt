Hufflepuff! His name is Trinket, all right? This is so awkward. Yeah, scoot the bench down. Look at how far the bench is on our side. Thanks for joining us this week. Longest announcements ever! The one that everybody wants, but nobody can have. You can read? Yeah. I'll surprise you with it, don't worry. He's not fine. I ask everyone to wait. Percy. Can you look through your scope and see who that is? The music. Are they from here? We don't have a lot of magic wielders with us, though. A lot of magic wielders. Sounds good. Perfect. So. Avoid the skeletons? They're in the way, Keyleth. Are they in the path at all, do they look like they're going to be near us when we go? I do. But, Keyleth, the minute we start fighting, they will notice us, and then they'll attack us from behind. I guess I use Pass Without a Trace on all of us. Did we already have it? From last time? It holds for up to an hour. Sweet. 30. Oh, shit. I forgot about that. (whispering) Good job, Scanlan. No. No guns. I shoot it with an arrow. Okay. Just going for it. Okay. I'm literally, I think I cursed myself sometime between here and San Francisco. 18. 15 damage. Oh, that's sneak attack, right? Because I'm hidden. Extra two. I was doing the one that was walking towards us, I thought the other ones were still in the area-- Yeah, okay. I hide. 39. Stealth. Yeah, do they all-- did any of the other ones notice that? Ah, shit. They were attacking us, they were attacking him! Well, you should keep a leash on them, then. Put them in a bright color, put a happy mask on them or something, so people know they're nice. You make candles, but you also make undead? Can I insight and see if he's telling the truth? 17. Well, you know what, we're on our way to do just that thing. Vox Machina. Thank you. Then you'll help us? It would be very strange. Carol and Coral? Yeah, tell you what, Gern, we're actually-- We should probably press on, and you can join us with your family. Perfect. We're short on magic people. That's wonderful. Are we still trying to stealth? Or does it even matter? All right. We head towards the thing. Does my Pass Without a Trace work on him too, does it like envelop him-- They're worse than Trinket, Scanlan. Okay. No no, she's done that. Really? Does it still look like Keyleth or-- what does it look like? Pretty freaking sick. Can you talk to it? I thought we were supposed to keep them from coming out into this world. Maybe you should ask it to go back. I take my potion of fire resistance. Do it. I think it's going well. Good job, Keyleth! They're turning around, they're heading back in that direction! You're very scary right now, dear. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. What? Pressure! Perception. Shut up. 30. No. 28. On everything? No, even better! I follow behind him and keep watching him. Can I see what it was? Should we let them know we're in place, then? I'm going to set an arrow on fire and shoot it up in the air. No, I'm going to tie some of my cloth from-- you know-- that I have-- The thing. I take some cloth from the Bag of Holding, from one of those old fancy cloaks that we have. (sighs) Seriously?! Can I have some of the fancy cloak? Grog, out of the Bag of Holding, please? Jesus Christ. Please. No idea if they saw that. All the other teams already responded. We were the third. I Hunter's Mark the big one. I'm Vex'ahlia, nice to meet you. Maybe we should duck down, so that nobody knows where that came from. Nice, Fatty! No, we should probably attack. I hide. Should we roll for stealth again, or are we still stealthed? Oh, I know, I was trying to hide, though. Like, back away from you as you were doing that. You're at the portal. That's okay. We're all going to die. The big one that I Hunter's Marked. Whoa. Look at how pretty those lava bubbles look! 13. So many times. It was inevitable. This is why I sort my dice at the beginning of the game... Yay! What?! MATT and When? When? Can we hold it? (mocking Gern's accent) Farty-far pints o' cald damage! Awesome. Wait, so they can unfreeze? Or are they basically frozen until something-- (groans) Okay. That yellow one behind me, that's Keyleth, right? Okay. I know, right? I'm going to flip backwards like ten feet. I don't want to be around anybody else, so I'm going to flip over the lava pit and go out there. That would be 38. And I Hunter's Mark the guy attacking near Percy and Scanlan and I shoot two arrows into him. Ugh. Where is my thing? Hold on, sorry. (giggles) 21? And 17. 17 on the first hit. And then 18 on the second hit. Yeah. Yes. That's Vax. They'll probably melt eventually. Oh shit. Yeah, just push 'em over, smash them. Do the other one now. You could hang a coat on him. We have a Bag of Holding. Oh, there's a giant monster. I Hunter's Mark it. Is it close by? Not tonight, though. Ah, so much! Is that behind him, is that what the-- Oh my gosh. So do some cold stuff, like this guy. Pass Without a Trace? Is that still in effect? No. 22. 19. Nobody cares, Marisha. What?! No! You have advantage, so maybe one of those would be a 20 if you rerolled them with their advantages. Are those trees, do they have any substance at all, or are they just there to look pretty? All right. I'm going to try to use one as protection. I'm going to hop behind the one over this way. And I'm going to Hunter's Mark the efreeti. And then I'm going to use my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. And I'm going to shoot him three times! That first one probably does not succeed. It is a 16. What about 23? All right. How about... mega miss. So one of those hits, because I'm a loser. 11. 17 points of damage and that's it because I suck. I am hiding behind the tree. These piece-of-shit dice. Do dragonborn have natural fire resistance? Oh no! Oh my gosh! That's a lot of gallons, for sure. Fuck yeah! Do that again, Keyleth! Okay. Am I hiding? Am I hidden? What is that number? It's completely smooshed off of the dice! There's literally-- But I had my skirmisher stealth. Yeah. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. All right, then I'm just going to... Everything's a concentration thing, so I'm just going to lightning arrow the giant fire guy. Yeah. Okay. 30! That's 4d8 lightning damage on a hit. 18. That's it. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to use my bonus action to hide then, with the skirmisher's thing. For my skirmisher stealth, I can use a bonus action to hide. You told me, I swear! Okay, where was it? Okay, where is it? I don't know where it is. I'll find it, and then I'll find out. And then I'll roll for stealth then if it works. My stealth roll is 15, it doesn't even matter. It's not in the book, it's in the-- 15. I feel really bad that I killed Carol now. Use it! I have the skirmisher stealth! As a bonus action at the end of your turn, you can make a dexterity (stealth) check to hide again. Did the skeleton and the zombie start dancing better, after that? Being pissed! Why am I laughing at that? Hey, Scanlan! What are we going to do with this giant ball? Can you bring it down, Keyleth? Are you going to bat him down like you're sweeping the sky? How come everybody flies? There's flying brooms?! Oh shit. I run forward to try to help him out. Hunter's Mark! It wasn't, because I used Lightning Arrow, so it dropped the concentration on it. Although it doesn't really matter because I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on him and I lose my Hunter's Mark again. Oh yeah! Oh, that's 31? 31! Okay! 23! That's better. I'm going to use my movement to run up around the molten lava and hold my hand out for Gern, so that he can use me to get out of the molten lava. Okay. Take my hand! Do you need me to hold your broom while you cast your spell? Thank you! Yes! Jesus Christ! I mean. It didn't kill him? I walk up to Grog. I pat him on the shoulder, and say, that was so impressive. A genuine mage! And I use sleight of hand to shove the flying broom into the Bag of Holding. 18? Oh no! Oh no! Your broom fell in the lava! I saw it! I tried to give it back to you and it fell in the lava! Yeah! 18. I'm so sorry. I wouldn't know. I don't even know. A tragedy candle. Grog, you should probably help them with all of your magic powers. Just hold your hands up, hold your hands up. Oh, yeah. Like fiery candles, maybe? Oh no. That's what you said. I can use-- I don't know if it will help, but I have a really great diamond of awesomeness that's precious. I don't know. I don't know how this magic stuff works. Do you have any magic stuff, Scanlan? Matador it. His diamond earring is glistening in the light. I walk up and I cast Cure Wounds on him. I've got jack shit. At a level three for you! I am! I am. 20 points. Yes? I know, and it's so kind of him. Look at all these treasures he's going to find here for his candles! 18. Do you collect dragon scales for your candles? Gern! Before you leave! You know, we're killing a very, very large dragon, hopefully rather soon. Well, he's in Emon now, but we're gathering our forces in Whitestone. All right! Good-bye! Can we get to Whitestone, can you bamf us? Let's go there and rest up. Your dad is very noble. Hey, Gern! Gern! Gern! Gern! Is it just dragon scales, or is it any dragon parts you use? Maybe we should just sleep here and rest up and spend the night, wake up in the morning, head back to Whitestone. Don't judge me, Scanlan, you didn't see me do it! Sam's just judging.
