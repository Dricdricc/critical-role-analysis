Well, those amazing David Mack posters that are only on sale-- well, okay, here's the thing. The signed ones are only available for one more day; they're going away tomorrow, forever and ever and ever, amen. After that, the not-signed version will be available for one more week, and then those are gone forever and ever, amen. So if you want them, you should get them. We also have a bunch of other shirts, like the Scanlan t-shirt, and the Vox Machina t-shirt, and every other t-shirt that are so soft and comfy and cozy. And the Slayer's Cake apron! Those will be shipping soon. Those will be shipping-- yeah, pretty soon. Pre-orders are still available right now. With the posters-- I'm going completely out of order-- with the signed ones, it's going to take a few extra weeks to ship those because we all have to sign them. Just be patient. We love you, and you will get them! The ones that aren't signed will get shipped out a little bit faster. One more day! (singing) One! Can we all come and open card packs? It was so good! Can they have a pillow fort in the living room? Is it? Where's Vax? What's this? Where is he?! What?! And we just left him there?! Oh god! No! I was brought back and his soul is just-- where? Can you bring him back? I go over and gather up all of his armor and start hugging it to myself. What are you talking about? Not just gold, you need diamonds? I don't have-- I don't have that! Was it her? Or was it Vecna? Can you put it in a bag or something? Cover it up? How bad was your first one? Could we smack the eye out of his hand? Can we see where it landed? No, I'm not. Just holding onto-- Of course, darling. I can't believe I left his soul over there, alone. I did. I came back. There's a temple in Vasselheim, and there's a temple in Whitestone. I don't know how you find diamonds in the Feywild. I might be able to buy diamonds, as well. If we go to a city. 25,000 gold worth of diamonds. It could be a lot of smaller diamonds. I'll pull out one diamond that I have that's worth 1,500 gold. We would need 20 more of these. I have to blow my nose again. Where? Scanlan. You're such a shithead. We have gold. We have plenty of gold. We could go to Kraghammer and buy, or we could try doing what Scanlan said. Should we get back to our world? Did you send us to the pond? I thought you took us to the pond. Oh, you took us to where Saundor was. You didn't take us to the pond with the chick? We have to spend the night here. Vecna's in our world. How much power does he get from that eye? Open the box and see what it's doing. Don't send it to another plane; that's very fucking weird. Are you sure nobody else can ever get into it? Then no. Then, fuck it, we're not doing it. That's really weird. No! Stop it! Cool. We're not using a random-ass magic trick on an eyeball. Are there any animals around? Natural 20. Anything that looks like it would be the size of an adult deer or something? I'm thinking a male deer. Yes, a stag. A white stag. Any stag, really, just an animal that's big. Yeah, we haven't healed since-- I'm low. I mean, we're about to rest. You're probably super low. Trinket's unconscious still in my necklace. He's unconscious. I pop him out, if you're going to heal us. I start crying again. You dick! You're such an asshole. Pike's going to heal us. I'm going to kill something. Will it work on a magical animal, or does it have to be a real animal? I was like, pocket dimension? Yeah. Hey, Trink. We're going to rest. Are we safe to leave fucking-- there's nothing we can do, at this point-- to leave Vecna in the world. We can't do anything! Don't cry on camera and then have to blow your nose a bunch! Okay, we have to wait. We don't have the mansion tonight. We need to get up in a tree. I don't know what's in this area. I saw some tracks that didn't look friendly. We healed this forest; it should thank us. Thank you. I'm going to pull the armor up so we can keep it. Did you want-- Oh fuck me running. We're jacking off. What are you going to do while we're not in here? Jacking in. No. Yeah, you do. You need to sleep. Vecna is back. Wait! Vax? I don't know. I'm asleep. What the fuck? I get up and run down. It's a trick! It's a trick. It's a trick of the Feywild. How are you here? I know. I didn't see it. I died, too. So are you. I have your armor, and Keyleth-- are you all right? Are you really here? Can I roll an insight check to make sure it's actually him? 20. There's a dick, and he's naked. Does he sound weird? Tell her to bring the armor down. She sent you back. She's my new favorite. He's fine. They were talking up in the tree. What do you mean, he's a lich or something? The Raven Queen? What if he is, though? Will he survive it? I don't think he is undead. But I don't want him to be able to be turned against us. He looks normal. I know it's you. Keyleth, we can hear you. Oh god, he's undead. We have no fucking idea what's going on. We haven't talked to her like you have. What did she say? Did she send you back? Did she say, "oh, you're going to be undead." We're figuring it out. Oh fuck. I'm going to take Whisper and cut him. I'm going to cut you right here. Red? Sorry. I cast Cure Wounds. I'd already laid claim on your boots. I'd come to grips with everything, and I'd decided I was going to wear them. Years ago? Vecna? I know. She hates him. Was Keyleth right? If we defeat him, do you go away? Just answer the question! Put your armor on. She's not my favorite anymore. We need to get back. That's going to be a t-shirt. Here, you can have these old boots of mine. I thought we knew this about me already. We don't need diamonds anymore. We don't need them anymore. It was a high-cost spell. Good to know in the future, though. I'm going to save every diamond we find. I feel like we were in Wildemount, but I have no idea. Where are the places that are winter? What about Artagan? That's his name, right? Artagan. Yeah, but he was really powerful. The help of the gods. Sarenrae. How do we go and talk to Sarenrae? Vasselheim? Where is Sarenrae? What, a plane? A heaven plane? A god plane? So how do we go there? Would they kill us? Does Pike have anything attuned to Sarenrae, though? No, you weren't. Yeah, the Raven Queen and Sarenrae are best buds, aren't they? It's a small group of people. They have to. Patrons. Lives here in the Feywild? Are we really going to pledge allegiance to a bunch of different gods? That's what we're going to do? Like Captain Planet? Who is that? You did? The Moon Weaver? They have a temple to her in Syngorn. Ioun is the goddess of knowledge. Let's go to Vasselheim. Start with one that really likes you. So Sarenrae's a good call there. Vasselheim. Wait, we didn't talk to Artagan. Artagan, are you here? Can you hear us? Do you want to help us? Right as we go, I start howling. (howling) Oh shit. Oh god, what if it's been years? We could lose our memories! We're immune to that, right? People with fey ancestry? Yeah, you have it, too. You're a half-elf. Didn't you lose your memory last time? Did we ever realize that you lost your memory the last time? Is that how we did it before? What are you doing? Scanlan, stop it! Stop it! That's why your eye hurts. Vecna was wearing a big dress, so we probably could have seen his balls. What? He knows where Vecna is? Cool. That's badass. 350 miles. How far is that from us right now? Where is that in distance? Really? It's that close? Okay. Eight-hour drive? Okay. Why? I don't know what you're talking about. To the temple of Sarenrae. I walk up to him and put my hands on the sides of his face. I can't have you away from me right now. You just had a really long conversation with her. Of course not. Sarenrae's a big fan of the cube. Let's do it! You did this? Holy shit! Can you try just talking to Sarenrae? What happened? We saw you praying and you had this crazy look in your eyes. So happy. What is it? You're not here! She gave us a key to find her. What the-- wow! What was she like? Yeah! Wow! That's convenient. (singing) Fortress of the Sun. This could affect everyone. So there's this guy. He's a shithead. Okay, there's this guy. He wanted to be a god, but he wasn't a god. We explain the story of Vecna and tell him he's back. He's here. He's here on this plane, and he's trying to become a god, and who knows, maybe he succeeded. How long were we in the Feywild? Do we even know that for sure? What's the date? But we don't know it. Oh, of course it is! Does that sound normal to us? For one roll. Get ready to fight, Vincent. Get ready to fucking fight. PS, do you know anything about the fields of Elysium? What gods live there? Right. Should you tell him? You guys, thank you for your help today. Melora is really good at it, too. We should talk to Melora. I like the idea that anywhere we go, we embarrass the one person that knows anybody else. Oh no! Oh no! What did you do? Ooh, what is that eyebrow? Stop rolling that one! I bet it's a 20. No! You're starting a war with all of the guards in Vasselheim? What are we going to do? Is the giant eagle small enough to Dimension Door? It's going to break your concentration. What's happening here? I'm reaching down for a head. Don't you want to talk to Kord? You punched-- Let's fucking get out of here. Are we just going to try to bamf to the fucking fields, or are we going to talk to Melora, or are we going to bamf to the fields and then go talk to Melora? I know, but we'll have to come back here. Maybe you can send a message. Do you have that ability? Is it fast to mist to the Fire Ashari? Let's go! It was snowing. Whoa. Plane Shift? No, this is not going to be dangerous, right? We're just going to talk to some friendly people. Three-point landing. It really is heaven. How pretty! Last episode was so ugly, and this episode's so pretty. You talked to Sarenrae! That's crazy. Wow. Not a single dice in the dice jail. (singing) Oh my god, my brother's a lich. He's such a lich. David Mack posters. One more day! Not even a full day! LIAM and Is Max still here? What kind of ice cream? Ice cream's gone. You're so old.
