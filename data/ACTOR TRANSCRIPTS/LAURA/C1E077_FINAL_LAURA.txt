I do not believe you. You're not-- No, no no. That's Loot Crate Clothes. But wait! Is there Gears of War stuff in here? I thought there might be. Shut up! What's the Harry Potter thing? Thanks, Loot Crate! I really like this. I brought my bag of dice home for the holiday and then I didn't bring it-- I maybe was going to give some of our dice to our winners for the costume contest. I just left them at home. I have a lot of dice, I just don't have all my dice, you guys. I still have a bunch up here. I do, I have a lot. But thank you! We need to get them safe. I take off on my broom and fly up in the air. I want to see up and over the wall and see what's going on on the inside. I don't want to go in, I just want to look. Yes. First roll, first roll, first roll. Here we go. 27. Yeah. I draw-- are they close enough to shoot them? Yeah. But I Hunter's Mark one of them. Oh wait, it's probably a ranged thing too. The rider. Oh, they're 1,200 feet away, they're that far? Can I shout down and yell, get the boys safe! But I don't know who I'm shouting it to, just one of you guys-- (yelling) Get the boys safe! Seriously? Should I hang out and wait or should we-- Do I see any dragons? I don't see any dragons, but it looks like about a hundred enemies. Well, that's going to take a minute. So I Hunter's Marked them as soon as they were close enough. The one that's biggest? The one that's closest. And I am a third level rogue now. So I get advantage on my attack, if they haven't attacked me yet, right? If they haven't taken a turn? As an assassin? At your third level, you get advantage if you get the drop, if they haven't taken a turn yet. They're moving? Well, all right. I guess I'll just have a 32 attack, then. 21, and then-- That is awesome. Do I get sneak attack on this? Okay, so it's just 21 damage, with four of lightning. Oh, I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage! An additional three. Do I get my second attack? 21. 18 damage. Trinket crits on a 19. Does it petrify you? I'm Vex. Hunter's Mark! 25. 23. On the first arrow. That is, what, 23? Yeah. 23. TRAVIS and Shut up! Ugh! 13. Three ones in a row! There's a hundred more guys inside, Grog! Keep running! I'm on the broom, so I'm up and over the wall. Are there any clusters that look like not a lot of our soldiers around, just lizardmen? Or is it all mixed in together? Are there any wyverns in the sky that don't see us? I want to try to get a sneak attack on one of the wyverns. I get advantage because the wyverns don't see me, right? Okay. 19. Okay. 33. 31. 31 on the first hit. 31. And the same, it's another 35 attack. 25 on the second. Poor your ass! I don't know! Can I shoot him with a Bramble Shot? I want to try to shoot him with a Bramble Shot. Yeah! I think so. He's a bad guy! That's why I'm Bramble Shotting him. Because I'm trying to tangle him up. Pike! Do you have your snitch? Do you want one of mine? Oh, no. What is it? Do it, Sam! Yeah, we can take out the wyvern. 25. Eight. I don't know what Pike's initiative is. Aww, you and Pike fighting together. I'm going to shoot a Bramble Shot at him. 20? 16. And then the DC is 16. Yeah. Oh! Then he's restrained! Yeah, he takes 16 damage. 16 damage from the shot, as far as I know. I get another of my arrow damage? What?! I didn't know that! That's so cool! Is it sneak attack? The thing on top. Hopefully he doesn't have a hold of the reins, so-- Now I've lost track. 28 damage plus the 16 from the Bramble Shot. Okay. 21? Oh, that guy! That was annoyed with us every time we-- I don't know. Yeah, he's probably working for him. We should definitely trust him. Should I fly towards him? I'm going to fly. I'm going to try get towards him. I don't have a broom paper. I never got a broom paper because I kind of stole it. It wasn't given to me. I think it's like 120. No. It's, I'd say, 50. I did! I said 50, right before he said it. Okay. Fucking shit, Keyleth! Oh no, oh no! You took off all your armor? If you have the armor on, it doesn't have to be attuned, you still get some-- You're just so teeny, Scanlan. Percy. They're slender and fabulous! All right? All of it. (growling) All of it! How'd you do that, Grog?! Don't you get an attack again if you killed something? Oh! Okay. Well, still. Huh? It just stabs me. Sure. Okay. Where's my thing? 21. And then I brace the broom to catch him-- Aww, buddy! (laughs) That's so great. Thanks! I catch him on the broom and hand him the-- What are you going to do? Yeah. Shit. Thordak comes and kills us all, right?! Do we get advantage for anything? (laughs) Why, though? 16 for me. 16. That's good. Fuck. (yelling) This is like when I made my Barbies date my G.I. Joes. (laughter) Fuck. Is that within range of you, to throw something at it and bamf there, or--? I'm going to try to fly over. Am I able to get to the roof above him? I'm going to ignore him and Hunter's Mark the giant, and then try to hit him from above. 21 on the first one. Yes! And that's Hunter's Mark and sneak attack, right? Damn it! Fine, fine. Which I did, yeah, so don't worry about it. 18 plus four lightning damage. Oh, and then again! I attack him again! And it definitely hits him! It's, like, 30-something. Argh. 17 plus four lightning damage! Oh, and I want to back up away. I want to back away from the-- So she can't see me no more! Can I crouch? Is that within my movement, to crouch? We're twins, you guys! No, that's a good hit! 19, yes, right? Oh god, she's a general! Oh no! Oh no! Yeah! Kill it! Just, like, right here. (laughter) Whoa! Oh no! Oh, that asshole that I'm standing next to. Fucking dick! That's a seven. But when I'm doing it, I'm also still intelligent, right? I'm going to walk off of it. I look at him, I walk off it. Can I pull out my broom as I walk off the edge and land on the broom? Because I did what he told me, technically? Really?! No, that's what I mean. I'm going to walk off the edge and pull out the broom. And just fly. And I give him a thumbs-up. Thanks, Boss! And Percy's over by the trebuchet in the corner. Yeah, you really do. Taliesin, you guys are talking so loud. Oh. Thank you, Percy. Damn you, Scanlan. Matt did a 3rd-level spell. 23, Percy! (whispers) Cast it really high. What?! Good job, Percy! Good job! Oh no. Yay. I don't get to make a saving throw? Fuck! Maybe he has to tell me who to attack. It's when I take damage? Oh, shit! I should have just fallen off the fucking roof. I'm sorry, Grog. Oh! Natural one! (laughter) And 20! No, no, no. 15 piercing damage. I didn't even Hunter's Mark you, Grog! I'm sorry! I don't? Oh. It was four lightning damage. It was 11 piercing damage. Sorry. That's it? That's all I do? I can't. I don't know to punch myself in the face. I'm not aware of what I'm doing. I just think, "I need to kill my friends." Okay. I'm just going to be up here! Shooting you guys! And your vow. Doubled? You double all your dice. Wow. There's a wyvern, and there's a wyvern. Looked like she was smelling her armpit as she did that. It's fabulous in the air. It's really good. No, no, no. You can do it, Percy! Well, they're trying to get through the wall. Grog's poor ass. (laughter) Obviously he's a bad guy. Obviously he's a bad guy now. Oh yeah, do I like him so much now? He's my friend? He's my friend, cool. I love him, he's my best friend. Xanthas is my best friend forever! I like him, you guys, I think he's great. You got it. That's 4d12 right there. I'll bet that's concentration. Something bigger than the spiritual weapon. But then, because he did a melee attack on you. Damn it. And attack me! Oh my god. Yes, can I attack my best buddy? Xanthas. He's my best friend. Motherfuck! With hearts around it and everything. Fine! Hey Grog, what's your AC? Because I got a 26 and a 29. You! 17. Piercing damage. Halved. Huh? Yeah, that's with the sneak attack. And then, oh, four lightning damage. Oh, that's just the first attack! Oh no! I'm sorry! 20 on the second attack. So ten damage on the second plus three lightning. Oh shit. (singing) I'm going to go because we don't get a break because we're fighting. Roll low, roll low! Oh, I mean roll high! Roll high! Wisdom saving throw. 15. That's even worse. Yay... I saw. That's sick. I've done more than that to everybody else. Sick. (groaning) I mean, he's so cool, but I mean, he sucks a little bit. No, I mean, he's really cool, you guys. He's the coolest. That's good, that's good. Roll so high! Ashley Jenkins! (gasps) You're alive! You're wearing your armor! Or take fire damage. I hate him! Don't take a step back, he'll hit you! No, that was with disadvantage. That hit, because you needed a 14. Oh, because if you get a critical-- It doesn't matter, it hits. I say, good job! I'm going to hit you in a minute! Who was it?! It's Kima? Does he need to make a constitution check? I'm pretty sure. No, right now I definitely want to shoot you again. Yes! Tell me it's my turn. I'm gonna fly right above him and shoot directly down onto his face. (triumphant laughter) And Kima's standing next to him? Oh, he's prone? Why do I get disadvantage because he's prone? Psh. Six-- no, 18? 18, and the other one definitely hits. 20. And I Hunter's Mark him because he's a fucking dick! Well, all right. 18. Where's my dice? 28 on the first hit! 13. 17 on the second hit. Yeah. That's right. I'm gonna say, I always thought you were a dick back in Emon. Don't fuck with me! Then I shoot him straight through the face. I turn back round and I go, sorry, Grog. No, Kima. He was mine. (laughter) At ten o'clock, a bathroom break? I search Xanthas' body. Yeah. Oh no, he asked. Does that mean that something's going to happen right now? We need to sleep, let's all sleep. Let's go to sleep right now. I'm taking it, of course I'm taking it. Okay. I inspect it. It doesn't do anything when I inspect it. Okay. But I'm doing it because Grog told me to, and he's brilliant. 11. Cool cool cool. "Talk sweet." Did you receive any word back from the armies? That's true. Xanthas? Get that fucker! We get three questions. Why are you such a dick? Yeah, 'cause you're nice. I don't know. Oh yeah. Could you make yourself look like a lizardman? Let's try the appeal. Let's try to make him like us. Yeah, we'll all back out of view. Especially me. Yeah, that's a good one! Who does Thordak trust the most? Yeah, who in the city does Thordak trust? Four, we've got four! Okay, so that's good. Let's start with this, and then we'll see where it goes. Yeah, can we insight check him? I remember that, we didn't roll high enough on perception. I rolled a 24 on insight. That's a whole lot. Who within the city fights against Thordak? We've only got two questions left. What? LAURA and Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Ask that. (whispers) So the Clasp is still resisting. Can I insight check him? 18. On the up and up? Like, who does Thordak trust the most? Wait wait wait. No, but I've been insight checking the whole damn time. 25. That's it. (gasps) Can I fly up in the air and see if I can spot the boys? Don't drop it! No, no. That's okay. I put it in my pocket. I'm just so glad you're safe. Everything is wonderful. Do you want to come back to the fort? All the bad guys are dead. Okay. I bamf Trinket out and let them ride on Trinket. He's got a taste for the celestial blood. Yeah. He had that wand that shattered. There were a couple wyverns that got away. That's why I don't know if it-- whatever. Say that again? They know about it! Yeah. They spotted us with scouts. (groans) Oh my god. Yeah. So they're a day away. Okay. So we have four days. All the troops, which is like, 20 people left. Well, we sent Raishan back to Whitestone with Asum and then we left, so for all we know Raishan's there. Potentially No, we need to rest! It started really strong. No. But we're gonna have to bring those guys back out here, right? I mean, we're gonna have to march with the 55 guys. So why send them through to Whitestone? Why not sleep tonight, deep within the fort, wake up in the morning? Yeah, but we need to rest now. Well, maybe we should do that. Can you use the mansion tonight? So we sleep within the fort. Deep within the fort. We'll put the guards on watch. I'm not, I'm not! I'm just saying that's the sound they'll make if they come. Let's find a bedroom and lay the fuck down. Is there somewhere to clean up? I'm gonna go soak. Then let's fucking go to Whitestone. Yep. That's what we said we were gonna do. Fuck, yeah, that's right! Okay, but I have two extra guys with us right now. Okay, yeah. See if Raishan's there. Potentially! Oh, Cassandra, are there rooms for these new guests? They're the sweetest! This is, um... Keurig and Human. (laughter) I have them written down somewhere, but I can't find it in my notes! What are their names again? I can't find it. Hunin and... Kyor? Got it. Angel babies. Writing it down. I guess they're about the same age as Cassandra, then, huh? Oh, damn. I'll stand. But wiped out a large percentage of the force there. Oh, my god. You'll fight alongside us? And Coachella. Brom? Do you know Osysa? The sphinx? There's a temple to Ioun in Vasselheim. There is. You would have no way of contacting it? Yeah, that's right, this was a temple to Ioun, we knew that. Well, yeah. No, all the ones she told us about. Did she say that? Do we remember her saying anything like that? It was from her hubby, her boyfriend. The one that said a name is earned. Do we need to go to him? Was there anybody that said they would help us once we got all the Vestiges? I feel like they said that once we got all the Vestiges we'd be like extra awesome. Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's do it. Ow ow ow ow. Oh, it's not magic down here There's no magic down here! Can you scry there now? Oh yeah, Keyleth! Can you scry? Not down here. We have to leave the ziggurat. We could bamf into the keep. Sweet. Is that relief? That was relief. Make this decision for us! Yeah. Sorry about that. I mean, is Gilmore strong enough? No, she's talking to her! Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what we said already. Oh my god. Oh fuck. It's going to be an empty bench over here. Wait, it's happening next week? We're going into battle? We don't have Travis and Ashley? Okay okay okay. No, it's not, don't say-- no it's not.
