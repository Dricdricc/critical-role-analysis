Oh no. That's really good. Wow. Great, that's what I'm going to hear at home all the time now. Oh, go to the store and check out shop.critrole.com. Did I get it right? There's t-shirts, and there's a bumper sticker that says something about the Traveler, and you know we all love that. They know what there is! And some pins, check it out. Maybe there's pins, maybe there's not. Maybe you should go check it out to find out. No, it's fine. No, it's all you. Ooh. Which thingy? There's some really questionable thingies in here, but you can see them if you want. Okay, well, there's that. You don't want to know. Well. And then there's that thingy. Caleb doesn't know about it, but he will later. And then-- oh! Were you talking about this? It's this box. Okay. Well, inside of it-- Open it up and just let your mind go and see what you think. Did you see the little ball, the little grey ball? Wasn't it weird? Is he inside of you now? Oh, you think it's an it, not a he? Oh, that's right. People are looking for it. I have. You can't look at it, though, today. Because he already has it. You have so many balls inside of you already. Lots of them. Back to the beginning of our notes. It's right there. How much have you built back already? Not bad, though, really. We don't need one. We have this magical dome that we sleep in, now. It's really cool. You should rent some of those out. I bet people would really like it. No, I have, they're just mostly-- It's memory lane. I see a big head of something shaped like a bowling ball. It is, it's a stinky-- but that was Caleb, I think. Hey, we're here to see Bryce. He looked like he didn't even remember us. We killed a whole bunch of gnolls for them. We cut off their ears and sold them for money. Ooh, so, if we're going to commit a crime, now would be a good time, huh? You too. Did you just call us The Mighty Nein or did you describe what we look like? Oh, wow, thank you! Party time. Okay. You too! I'm glad you're not in the war right now! Molly. It's halves and halvsies, you know? Yeah, but then we were helping other people, though, at the same time. So. Caleb, do you need to buy paper here or anything? Okay, just making sure. For Bryce too. They're coming. (gasps) I use Thaumaturgy to open all of the windows! (singing) Memories! Cheers! And Nott! He was really dirty, covered in a lot of– Yes, I remember that very well. Whoa. They've got some serious magic stuff over there. Do we know anyone else that's important? Anywhere. I know the Starosta here. He'd probably would have some say. No, I remember. Maybe I could give back that letter and he can give us a new letter! Because you don't even want it anymore. Oh, heck yeah! I'm really good at that. Now's the time to do it! There's not a lot of people here. He's a bit of a prick and what I've heard? It's not that big of a prick. Just from what I heard. I didn't see it see it, but people talk. Did I often see what what? Like? Penises? Wieners? I've seen so many penises. Yeah. I mean, I've seen them mostly not when they knew that I could see them. If that's what you mean. It is true, though. Like, why? My best dick. Okay. Honestly? I saw Molly's when we were in the bath house. Molly's was pretty good. It was really nice and it was a good color. Oh, that's right, he did some stuff to it. No, when it was clean, it was lovely. Cheers again! You should. You should come visit us over in the Menagerie Coast. Just leave! Okay, you're a good person. Honestly, I've never seen any goblins there. These are so creepy. Ew. It's warmer. It's nice. Skin mittens. Should we sleep here? Well, all right, didn't know if we wanted to sleep in the bubble, but, you know-- Here. Could I have, before we went to sleep, sent a message to my mama, letting her know we might be passing through? Okay. What did you say? Morgen? Morgen. How do I say, "I would like some pastries, please?" Oh. It's really pretty, the ocean. The water is really blue. I think you guys will like it. Yes, Nott, even you. It's really blue, and it smells like fish! I'll ride with Caduceus. I'll help you. You're good with animals, though. (gasps) Manners. (singing) Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are. (laughs) I do that for way too long on the road. Bye! Aw man, we saved their lives. That's pretty cool. Oh, yeah, I was going to help him. Whoa! I'm going to say that's my help. That's me helping. What doesn't? The field? Maybe somebody is sitting in the little alcove. Should we go attack it?! I don't know. Do you want to, like-- I hop off the cart and, like-- How far away is it? I'm going to throw a little rock as hard as I can towards it. Please be a good strength check. That's not good. That's 11. Maybe somebody's buried there. I don't know. Maybe it's a secret entrance to something! Did you say how tall the rocks are? (whispering) Treasure! Did you find some paper? What are you doing? Caleb, Caleb, Caleb! What did you find, Caleb? Pull it out! Why don't you let Nott look? Is there poop in it? Open it up! Diamonds? Are there diamonds? Somebody's going to be so pissed! (singing) We got lots of jewels here! They are so pretty! We should get in the cart and drive away really fast. I'm going to empty the jewels out and-- Let's put a bunch of rocks in it! It's fine. They're not going to die. They'll probably open the bag before they deliver it, you know? Then they'll see it. Rocks, rocks, rocks. And one little piece of dried poo that I found that was an animal's. You got to know where to look. And poop! Dried poop! Yeah, I'll write that. My notebook, I don't know what happened to it when we moved, so that's why I can't take notes anymore. I'll find the notebook somehow. Don't worry. You want me to be in charge of money, I'll be in charge of the money. It reminds me of Caduceus. It's a unicorn. Ashley gave this to me. I'll help him. (whispering) That looks like somebody who's going to pick up some jewels. Everybody, look casual! I see him do that. I do the same thing. I make myself look like a young human girl with lots of freckles and big, poofy red hair. He's driving the cart. You're very quick, you! Probably. It's getting late. No, no, no. I don't think they do. We could go see Gustav. Milk for me, please. Is he not in jail? Could I have some chocolate? And some milk? Yeah! I heat it up and I put it in my milk. Does he have to eat? But he likes it? I understand that. You have almost that much? Holy mo-- (gasps) You have so much money! That's great. You should put some chocolate in that. It's better. To the jail or wherever. Yeah. Talk to Lawmaster Norda. Soon. Not everyone likes us. Hey, do you like it in this jail cell? Maybe it's really comfortable, huh?LAURA,  (ambiguous noises), MARISHA, MARISHA Yeah, I'm going to wear a mustache. It depends on how much is left, because we don't have a ton of money. Can you tell the future? Can you tell the past? (gasps) Is he a guilty man? He looks really happy in here, right? What do you think when you look at me? Okay. (gasps) (whispers) His brain. I don't have any money to throw at this. Well, I guess I have a little money to throw at this. I can put 50 gold in. (laughs) Oh my god. Okay, okay, still good. This is like us trying to figure out a check. Say thank you! I cast Wand of Smiles at him. It's a charisma save. Oh, good, you have to smile! Yay, he's so happy! She's up north. We'll send you a message, don't you worry! When you drink tea made of dead people, you see things. Bless you. It's a lot! Where did you even get that gold? You spent a thousand gold! Well, the tarp isn't magical. The cart is magical. It just looks like a cart. Are you okay? Does that happen when you think really hard? But then it won't work! I have Dispel Magic, but-- I don't think they're trying to arrest people on the way out. I think it will be easier to get out of the Empire than back in. They won't know that it's human. How about don't do that. Yeah, all of us. The cart isn't covered. Let's just make it look totally empty. Yeah, it's fine. I'm going to focus on the thing. Okay, Fjord, you focus on it. Right as I started to focus on it, you can steal it from me. Mm-hmm. By mount up, he means everybody walk next to the cart. Oh no, we totally emptied the cart. Like, at all. I did not. Yes. If it's really bad, you can roll again! Ah, he knows everything! What? Where up ahead? Get back in the cart! Get in the cart! What is it? Just one? Who's this Tal you speak of? Oh, that's right, it's just you. I think all of us jumped in the back. Oh my god, look at how amazing that map is! Look at our beautiful horses. How come one-- Mamma Mia is way prettier than Dancing Queen. Oh, okay. I was inside, but I'll take it. All of us were in the back except for Taliesin. Look at your little mini. Your mini's so pretty. Whoa! This is great! Cool. He already did it. He already did it. Oh no! How long is the duration? I landed on six. It is a sad day. Technically, you're in the back of the cart. That's good. They're big. Ooh. Not bad. You guys rolled 16, yeah. Oh no, Beau! From when we got the bag of jewels? Oh, okay. Just making sure that-- okay. It's been days? Ah, that's me! Okay. I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon as a bonus action. Right above his head so I can smack him. Yay! Look at that cutie. Look, it's going to smack him on the butt. 24. That's just a one, so that's five. I'm going to run forward and touch him and cast Inflict Wounds. Just kidding! I'm going to cantrip him. Damn it. I'm going to cast Toll the Dead. That's a-- let me click on it and find out. Wisdom. Yeah, 2d12! That doesn't count because it jumped out. That's a shame, I know. Woo! Two nines, 18 points of damage! One bell for each head. And then I jump out of the cart and run towards the horses. On the opposite side. Yeah, I got to run past the horses, because I know they're going to catch up with me. But Fjord's right next to him. Six plus four is ten. Caduceus, you have to heal him! Like onto his wenis? Oh, weird. Yeah, it's blanks. The beetle bit you? But hey, you saw a lot of things. Oh no! I thought he was dead! Oh man, okay. I'm going to send my Spiritual Weapon over. Does it get there? Probably not. That's fine. Am I within 120 feet of the guy that's down? Okay, then I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt at... 3rd-level, fuck it. Okay, Guiding Bolt. Hold on, I'm sorry, I can't tell what's happening. Guiding Bolt. Okay. Okay, that does hit, that's 19. 6d6! That was only five, huh? Okay. Six plus ten is 16, 23, plus one more... 24. It's on my waist. I'm going to hop back on the cart. Hey Fjord, did you see that? That was pretty cool, huh? You could get within 60 feet. Those fireworks rivaled Hupperdook's. Caleb! Blood fungus! Ew! I'll help you. Are there people in them? 19. What kind of creatures? Do you have animals in there? Did you-- Are they nice? (gasp) Wait, wait, wait! Can we pet them? Okay! I run over. Ooh. You might not want to go that way. There's a lot of guards blocking the entrance into the Empire. There's a war going on, didn't you know? What kind of animals do you have? I want one. Well, I should probably hold them to see if they will like me or not. I mean, should we have some tigers? I am really happy with them! What else do you have, though? Is he nice? How much is she, though? Well, I could probably get all three. What else do you have? Oh, put it on my horn! I mean, they're basically free. Wait, I need to hold the weasel. I'm thinking about buying the weasel. I feel like I'm really holding these animals. Wait, if you buy the owl and I buy a weasel, is your owl going to eat my weasel? I don't want him to eat my weasel, though. Can I hold it? Kind of like a mix between Nott and Caleb. Ah! What can it do? What is it trained to do? How much is this one?! 100 gold! For a cute blinky dog?! I want the dog for sure. Yes. How much is the weasel again? How much for the weasel? We should split the dog, and we can have a pet together, and he can room with us whenever we go anywhere. And then you can get your owl-- I don't know. We could figure it out. We'll have pets. He looks as pissed as you look all the time. Pretty good. You should have it, and just keep him on your shoulder all the time. No, no, I want the weasel! No, we're going to get the dog, too. 60 gold each. I have a weasel! He's a white owl? He's a barn owl? Okay. (gasps) What should we name him? Nugget. Nugget. We are home. What do we feed them? Don't let Nott find that. Is that for the dog or— I've got the weasel up here and the dog right here. Nugget. And we are home. Always blink to us. Oh god, he's going to blink away immediately. Okay. 12. Ah! We got you, it's okay! It's okay! Oh my god, I love him! We have a dog. What the fuck did we just do? I don't know. This was like a Renn Faire purchase. We have a pet! We have another pet! I don't know.
