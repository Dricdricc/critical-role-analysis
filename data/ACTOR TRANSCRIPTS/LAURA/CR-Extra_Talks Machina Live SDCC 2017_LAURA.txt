I feel like this chair is really low. Excuse me. I'm surprised we made it to this room. I recognize those half-elves. Don't give away too much! This is my favorite panel! Still very charming. I can't believe you weren't there for the cow episode! Yeah. Oh no! Matthew! I liked the visit to the Nine Hells. Yeah, that was great. But we don't get to choose, right? Okay. You can come back as animals? That's cool. I don't know. I would like to come back as a half-celestial. Can you do that? Yeah, that's what I want. I want blue hair, man. Slightly blue skin and blue hair. That's perfect. I've got it! Oh my god, that would be great. Wait, I need a question clarification. Is this all of us as Vox Machina doing a trial by combat and then summoning one ally, or each individually? But only with allies that we've traveled with. Not Vox Machina. Allura. But is it a trial by fisticuffs? I just need to know. I feel like Vex is getting close to that anyways, so. That would be awesome. He is so dreamy. I feel like the preparation for it can be very similar. I feel like we slid our way into our backstories and everything like that. We had loose ideas of what it was before we started playing a lot, but when you're starting a new role in a theater show-- what am I talking about? Then yeah, you would do the same thing, you would establish all of those ties in your mind, and you would figure out what is their favorite music to listen to, and what kind of food do they like, and all that kind of stuff, and it's the same stuff you do with this. What is it, C is for Cookie? That was one year? We have a hot tub. So? Sure. (laughter) Just tears. I was never going to keep them! Until he's dead, and then they're mine. Grateful for Percy and for Whitestone and for having a place she can call home. I know. And for, you know-- For Vax being back. And even for, you know, she's grateful for the time that they have. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, no. I see who this is. He was gone so fast! What you got for us, Ray? What, you'd be the raven-- Right now! Arm wrestle. I don't know. The goddess of commerce, or-- (laughter) All things sparkly? Pretty much. Her temple would be where you drop off your gold at, you know what I mean? That's a good question, though. I could probably build a house from them, so. It's fine. It has to be 16-bit? I was a PC gamer during that time, and so I was King's Quest and Quest for Glory, so. (sings) Thank you for your question. Well. I've always wondered about the holodeck in that way, because-- It has to happen, right? You have an entire crew of people that are like, (hums). I know! Maybe they have a secondary holodeck, you know what I mean? That's actually Valkana! I think they would all get along with Lemley so well. Vex doesn't poop. I'm just putting that out there. She never poops. Ever. Oh! Do you eat? Oh no! How are you going to have a Heroes' Feast? Then tell us. Tell us his weaknesses. Hi, Sean! That was great. It was pretty. I liked it. When we're all dead. (laughter) You could put on a mask. Um... No! Oh, it's lightning round. Shit. Shoot. No, I'm surprised that she is willing to take responsibility for more than just herself and her brother and her bear. She's pretty great. So we could visit ourselves if we live?! (yells) Oh man! That's so cool! Oh! Trinket babies! Oh no, Tova, you have to come back! (laughter)
