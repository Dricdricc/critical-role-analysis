Oh god. Go check that out, guys. Yes, she is. Obviously. Yeah. I don't have a plan B. Oh my goodness gracious! So yeah, starting today, there will be a couple of Critmas hoodies available in the Geek and Sundry store, so Marisha, if you want to hold up one? There's black and green. You guys should go on the website and check it out, because all the little details are freaking amazing. And these are designed by Kenneth. There's a little Trinket and there's Minxie. And there's a Pepperbox shooting bullets And there's "dagger, dagger, dagger." So they're the coolest, and then I know everybody was talking about how the "How Do You Want to Do This?" shirts were sold out. Those will be coming back very soon, and there is also "How Do You Want to Do This?" mouse pads for those people that don't want to wear anything and just want to surf the web. We're like newscasters. Yeah, there's some other cool things coming up, too, but that's what's available now. Well, also if you go to the website, then you can see the blurbs that we wrote about each of the songs and the explanations about why we chose them. Grand slam plans. Like a marathon? I want to see if it works. Say it again. CritRole. They are very sexy. And they have magnets in them to keep your dice protected when they're in your other bags. Your Bag of Holding. That's Gilmore's mini. Any time Gilmore talks, can he have that mini? Point down! Fake helping. Yeah, and I had just snapped it off into the locks so that it's jammed it. Oh, we'll be back. Don't worry. I look around. Has everyone left me? All right then I follow to where everybody else is going. Me and Scanlan. Okay. I go and I find Scanlan. So, question. When you cast Seeming on us, our visual-- if you made me look like a cow, would I seem like a cow when I bumped into you, or would I seem like a human? No, I'm saying that if something was different-- I think that old woman was doing something weird. Because she looked like she had full handses, but-- Full. Normal sort of hands, but I didn't feel them. Her hand touched me, but it didn't-- So she was doing some sort of-- I guess it's good that we left her, then. I don't know. I don't know. Can you dispel Seeming? Yeah, I'm far away from her now. I think she had Seeming cast on her. I don't know if she did it herself or if-- well, I don't think she was what she appeared to be. So you can do Dispel Magic? Stay in the shadows, Keyleth, and cast it on her. A dude in a hat. Well, yeah. She'll look like she's not herself. Do it. I'll stay in the shadows with my arrow notched. So my arrow will do much better than your dagger. No, it's fine. Shoot your arrow, too. Shoot your dagger. Whatever. Tell us and we'll release you. Do you recognize her, Percy? You gave her a fucking dagger? And then it flashes back to you, right? (laughter) You are so fucking lucky it did that. (laughter) How did you lose the hand? What? You say you're a scientist. Do you use magic? Then who cast Seeming on you? This is Clarota all fucking over again. Oh god, are we really letting her out? She's got one hand. How's that going to be useful? He poops on things. I snapped off a thing in there. Sorry about that. You're going to use Luck now?! Sorry about that. It never ends! Trinket, watch her. Tell us what you need and we'll get it for you, dear. Can you walk quietly? Please? We did. We already checked them all Do we see anything in the room? No, but there is fighting. Can we hear fighting? Can't we look at what she's built after we fight them? I creep over to one of the doors in the room and see if I can hear anything on the other side. (groans) 14. Can I see if the door handle is-- I step to the side and push it open. And? Sure. That could've been so bad. 20. It was like whee-- oh. Nice. I would loot, but it's Percival's home. Do we see anything that looks like it could be a doorway leading down, or anything? We're on the main level. Do you know, Percival, how to go under? I will wear it. Thank you. Oh no! I guess. There's fighting going on now. I don't want to eat right now. I saw fighting, lots of fighting. I feel like if we're going to move, we need to do it quickly. That was a good idea. Very smart there. Wait, if I put the holy oil on things, it lasts for a few hours, right? It lasts for half a day or something? It dries and stuff. What do you want? What's in there? I walk in with her. Don't be creepy, Grog. (laughter) Tell you what, I'll hold onto that armor for the time being. Yeah, you can take it off. We'll put it in the Bag of Holding. You can put it on after we're done. Are you planning on fighting with us? Helping us? Tell you what, we'll take the weapons and give it to you if we need your help. No, I'm taking the weapon. I don't care. What does that mean? Oh. Well, then give it to me. Careful. That's made of glass, darling. Ooh, I get a piece of paper! This is awesome. Yeah! We were also running out of time. There are people fighting right now. When we defeat the Briarwoods, you can come back and explore this room to your heart's content. An important question here, Percy. Are they keeping her, or is she here of her own volition? Ziggurat? What's it for? Is it underneath the Sun Tree? He's probably with the Briarwoods. Anna, shut. Up. Percival. "Anna!" And I notch an arrow and aim it right at her throat. "Shut. Up." Brother, run and check the study. Let's go towards the under-- Lead the way down. No talking. We're heading down. He's going to catch up. Well, you've worn Clarota's thing before. Don't. I know. We've been here before. So we take off running towards him. (softly) I don't think it's her. It's not her. Could be a peasant. Just flip the little switch. It's just you, Taliesin. 11. Yeah. (laughing) She was trying to set us up in this trap. You do understand that? That's good. What's going on. (sing) Arrows and bows! Fuck! We've got to kill that motherfucker! Either way. Whoever it is. Just do it. So I'm with Anna. Trinket-- I tell him to hold onto her and drag her along with us. So he clamps down on her arm. 16? But I can keep running? I can run all the way up? 30. So I can shoot an arrow? Okay, cool. Shit. That's good. He's unconscious. No. If nobody hits you-- Okay. So I saw him go down. Does it look like he's awake now to me? I'm mean, it was all happening very quickly. I scream and I run towards him. I slide down on my knees and slide across the room and try to cast Healing Word the minute-- or cast Cure Wounds the minute I get to him. If I slide down and slide? With inspiration. That is-- wait, hold on. Acrobatics? Oh, that's good. 17? Okay, so I'm going to cast that at 3rd level. So that's 3d8. Where are my d8s? That was the worst roll! Nine! That's okay, because I slid to you. Yeah, and Trinket keeps dragging her. Right, okay. It's going to count even though it slipped out of my hand. It's eight. She ain't got no weapons. All right, he's going to bite her. Can he cannonball her as an attack of opportunity? No? Not so much? Nine. Oh wait! Oh, no. I've got to roll for attack first, huh? That was not what I was doing. So that's 21. Okay, good. That's way better. Oh, I don't know what I'm doing. What is going on? I never attack with Trinket. 13. Right. Good old classic rage. You get three hits. I thought rage-- oh. He can attack you, though, because he's right next to you. So I'm still down on my knees. I look up at Percy who is covered in smoke, and I grab his hand and I say, "Percival, how are you?" "Darling, take the mask off," and I-- And I shoot at the guy that's attacking Grog. Does he get an attack of opportunity, though, if I scooch back? Okay, yeah. Hits. Bastard! Okay, that is a 26 and a 23. I didn't Hunter's Mark him, because I'm brilliant. Yes! 15, 30, 34 points. Yeah, two eights. Plus 14. Plus my bracers. I stand up. I scooched back, right? Yeah I wanted to be like-- Yeah, like up into them. And Trinket isn't allowed to move any at all? Can he run after her? Okay. That's in the corner. I can't really say. Don't do that. I hate that sound. (laughter) That's a 12. Yeah. No, it doesn't. You're out. Damn it!
