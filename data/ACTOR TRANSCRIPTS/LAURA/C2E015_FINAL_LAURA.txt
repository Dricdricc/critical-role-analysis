No more of you doing my voice, Matt? What? No! But it's free! Glory be to Grog. Wait, I'm coughing tonight a lot, so if I do, everybody just stop and stare at me. So if I get up and leave, that's what happened. I don't want to have a coughing fit on screen. Or I pooped my pants. Yeah, sorry, I just wanted to put that out there. Wait, what?! Just kidding, I was watching. (quietly) They killed him. Nonagon. I remember that Fjord asked me to be in his boat. Yeah. Nonagon! (singing) Na na na-na. Yeah. Our ship is so colorful. Although, I think probably, Fjord, I should be the one paddling the boat because I'm a bit stronger than you. Okay. No, I just-- no! I'm glad I'm back. Oh gosh! Are we going to fight undead things? What is going on? This is just like that scene in Tusk Love. The scene where the ship is sinking and Oskar and Genevieve have to paddle to shore! Guinevere! That's was it was. I remember Oskar a little more. Only Oskar was paddling in that one. It is. Should one of us go in one and one of us go in the other? Should we go in the bow or the stern? Can we feel more wind coming from either side? Wind. 21! You should row backwards too, Yasha. I think left. Should I follow them? Okay. So you'd be fucked. (gasps) It's just like the rug! Oh my god! I rolled a one, too! (cheering) Oh, cool. I like the cat just like blah. We rolled real bad. Five. You don't have any initiative? Okay, so you rolled a three. Good job. Zwei. SAM, TALIESIN, It looks like no, I'm seeing your angle. Oh, my glasses are in my car, shit. Oh, it's like Hunter's Mark. Wait, another one came down on Fjord? Oh, no. It's going to make us blind too, we got to kill it quick. It looks like he was being born. I can't see anything on the other side. Yeah, I mean I will move the boat closer up. Oh, that was terrible, six. I can't move the boat, y'all. Okay. Does that count as an action or a movement? Cool. Thanks. This is fun, guys. All right, then I'm going to save-- Yeah. That's what I got, I guess. Yeah. Sweet. Did you hear a splash? Oh no. Oh. That's not a rock. Things are looking up, you guys. Leap for it! Because it's a ranged attack. Skip off the ground?! Earth elementals? (screaming) Oh my god. Oh gosh. Well, I hate to use my action to do anything else, but I should probably try to get away from the thing that's on the shore, huh? I'm going to action row! Strength check! That's a good one. That's just Jester's strength. That's a 22. I'm going to use my bonus action to turn around and go Eat shit, rock face! Oh god. It's pitch dark?! It got eaten by the darkness. We crash into each other and get stuck. Ah, let me go! I think those things are going to get us. I know. Actually, I'm feeling a little guilty for calling him-- What if he just wanted to be friends? I'm trying! (squeals) Yeah, we're rowing backwards. Slowly. Should we park the boats? Can we have some light? A little less blue. Can we clear out these rocks? But we're right here. (grunting) Well, that's totally cocked, that was terrible. Athletics? 13. Ooh. Hey, Caleb, look! Don't you want to steal that? It's probably magic. Would you want to go up? It's a couple flights up, though, you said? Let's go down. Usually scarier things are down. Yeah, so Nott in front. I guess I can be after Yasha. Okay. Are we free of traps in this little-- Okay. Should we send Frumpkin down there and see if it's clear? Oh, yeah. Cats can see. The rules need to be changed. Why don't you send your little dancing lights down there with him? What if I just send something that's on fire and I throw it down the tunnel? Really? Oh, it's resetting. We're just seeing you. You're really close to us, aren't you? Can you disarm the traps so you don't keep just setting them off? A button! Are there any more? Oh no, is this going to be a puzzle? Oh, fuck me. No, I'm going to run. You can do it. It's okay, Nott. I pat your head. You know, it's a lot of stress. You're learning still. Then the log coming down! We're at Burning Man, aren't we? We're at Burning Man. That thing's going to try to kill us. Oh wow. It's big. What skills you got? What?! This is intricate. Are all those facing towards Fjord? On the ground? Just on the ground? Yeah, take your time. Are the symbols just painted on the ground, or are they carved into the ground? They're on the ceiling? Does that mean we have to cast some spells or something? I wonder if you have to stick something in the hole and twist it. Stick your wang in it. Oh, because of the thing in the middle. Does the pillar coming out of the ceiling have a hole in it as well? I am really good at finding holes. Yeah. 20. But the hole is-- Yeah, the hole is-- I open up my sketchbook and I start drawing the symbols. Here, look, I made this beautiful picture. Well, I'm really talented. Cantrip? No. (snickers) I'm sorry. Oh, I can help you. You want me to heal you? I'm going to cast Cure Wounds. Yes. I did it on you, too. So that's seven points of healing for you. Does that help? Yeah, I'll looking for will-o'-wisps. Yes! That's real good. Seven. Deadless? MARISHA and Does that look like that shape? How big? Do you want me to throw something up at the vase and try to knock it over? I'm going to get down on the ground. Ayyyy. There's a rod. Where are the faces on the ground? Yeah. Whoa! Should I stick something in these eyes? Don't break it. Wait, do you double it because it's a critical? I was wherever those bodies where, because I was kneeling down and looking at them. It look like lightning corn on the cob. Oh no! It's like never ending. It's not a surprise, at least. 12. These are the will-o'-wisps? Aren't will-o'-wisps like kids? Aren't they the spirits of children? That's what I learned in Quest for Glory Shadows of Darkness. 15 didn't hit them. Okay. As a bonus action, I'm going to cast Sanctuary on Nott. It doesn't say concentration. It doesn't have that on the-- They have to make a wisdom save if they attack her. Then as an action, I'm going to use my cantrip of Sacred Flame. The one next to Molly. No, it's a dex save. It definitely saves. She rolled six. I should have thrown something at the vase! Those guys were so stupid. They could have broken the vases. How dumb are they? You want me to try to heal you? I'll try to heal you. I'm going to cast, at a 2nd-level, Cure Wounds, because Nott seems like she's dying. Goddamn it! Really? One and a two. MATT and I could've cast it at 1st-level! Damn it! You still only got fucking seven points of fucking healing! Goddamn it! I just wasted one of my 2nd-levels y'all! Which room? Let's take the piece of metal down! Wait, does each of the urns have a different one? Oh. Yeah. Charred? Fjord, do you see anything cool down there? Does anybody have weapons or coins on them? We'll get you out. Just look for something cool, though. What kind? You can ask nicely. Everybody else was resting up top while-- It's okay because I don't get my spells back with rests, so that's really good that I used it and everything. Yeah! She needs better organization. You got to divide them out. I think the corkscrew's going to stick in the hole and move the whole room or something. We can try to move some of the rubble? Do we know which way we're turning everything now? TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and Oh, everybody knows it already. But why did you decide the way that you're saying it? Yeah I like the way you guys think, that sounds smart. So that's evocation you guys, and divination, and necromancy. Maybe it's got to be a real person. Maybe you have to cast a spell that has to do with the class of magic! Cast a spell on one of the bowls! (angrily) No, it's fine! I don't know, I could Inflict Wounds on it or something, or Toll the Dead on the bowl. Well no, I'm going to use a cantrip because it's better. So I'm going to Toll the Dead on-- Necrotic, divination, and evocation. So I'll try to Toll the Dead on one of the bowls, the one that is sitting on the diamond. Wait, is it turning? Yeah. See, this is why I shouldn't have used my spell! That wasn't a dick joke! 20. I don't know, how do you fight a gelatinous cube? I know! But I don't know how to defeat them! Can it? By magic, maybe. How long does the spell last? I'm going to back up away from it. I'm going to use the Sacred Flame cantrip because I figure it's not very dextrous. It's a 1d8 radiant damage. Six! Did it look like it did anything to it? Okay. Yes. Is there something in it? Back away from it. What if a tentacle comes out of it or something? There's no harm in raging. Assault it! Advantage. She has advantage because-- It's a cube! Did she get-- oh, nevermind. No, it's more than that! Here's ten, plus five, 15. 22. Stupid cube! Oh no! Is she poisoned? I know, right? High-level rogue was still pretty cool. Oh no, it breaks free?! Beau's right next to it. It's going to slurp you. Half of its movement. Oh no. Who's it going for?! No! Oh man, and it's right next to me now? Oh god! Okay. Ooh, I'm going to cast Toll the Dead on it. It's a wisdom save! Also 14. Balls. Okay. Okay, then I guess I'm going to (singing) try to back away from it. Towards Fjord. A little further if I can, please. Because it probably can't move very far. Bitch of a fucking marshmallow! I'm out. I'm unconscious. I was. Yeah. If I die tonight, when I decided to come and play even though I'm coughing-- I'm going to die, you guys. When does the cube go? Oh, Oskar. Thank you for saving me. Sorry, I mean Fjord. Yes. Oh. Did we kill it? Sorry, I think that was my fault, you guys. Who has divination, though? Does anybody have one of those? Can your mage hand lift you up? Wait. I have an idea. Maybe we should take the bowls outside of the room and cast something on the bowls and see if one of the symbols on the bowls light up. That way, the staff doesn't absorb the spell immediately. Because when I cast Toll the Dead, I was trying to cast it on the bowl, right? But instead, my spell went up into the middle of the staff. Maybe if we try casting it on the bowls outside of the room, that won't happen. Just so we don't have to fight another cube, just in case. How many points of healing did you give me? When you poured the spell in my mouth? I'm feeling like I'm a little sick right now, but you know. I'm feel like I've got very little health. Like I'm bleeding a little bit from my ears. Caleb, I have healing spells still. It's okay. I wasn't bitching at all! You asked. Let's fucking go out into this hallway, okay? Should we try casting a spell on one of the bowls and see what happens? No, we don't. I don't think so because we're not in the room anymore so we can try to see if the bowls do anything. I'm going to cast my Spare the Dying cantrip. Necromancy. Wait. I blow on the bowl. Does it look like any of the symbols got any brighter? Do we need to set these on fire? You need three spells. We need to set it on fire? Hold the torch under one of the bowls. Just hold it under and see what happens. Hold the torch under one of them for a long time and see what happens. Woah! Here we go. We were wrong about what we needed to cast. That's that one. What is this? Illusion! We need an illusion. Transmutation-- I have an enchantment. I can transmute or something. I think so. We don't even need the bowls. Wait. I got to find my spell that actually does the thing that I said I could do. Wait, I have enchantment. Enchantment. I have enchantment. Okay. I'll go stand by the enchantment-- under the symbol for enchantment, just in case. Can you do enchantment? I think we're casting it at the staff. Do we need to be standing in front of the symbol that it lines up with? I'll go stand in front of the three dots. We count to three and we go? I'm doing Hold Person. Hold Person. Oh man! That's good, because who knows what else we'll run into while we're down here. You should detect traps. Beau, should I use my last spell to heal myself? So I should cast the spell on myself? This seems like a waste of money. I'm trying to be smarter with my money. Be careful! I'm hanging out with Caleb and Beau. The will-o'-wisps. Are we in the other room still, or did we come in? Can I look around the room? We're in the room. Let's go. Ooh, I'll climb up on the bookshelf. Does it look trapped? Is this trapped on the wall? Climb up on the bookshelf with me! Should I try to pull it out? I lift, I pull, and I try to pull it off the wall. Good job not getting stabbed, you guys, because this is sharp-looking. This is a sacrificial blade for sure. I'm holding it. It's pretty girthy. Can you identify it? I'll strap it to my back. It's very sharp and the bag is easily punctured and I don't want to risk it. I'll strap it to my back. Ooh! Why? The thing is, he probably won't ever tell us. Say it all out loud. What? But then this sword belongs to the guy who came to save Siff? The bounty hunter? What was the thing about "fire or ice," though? It was like, "fire or ice?" Hold what still? I'm good. I don't have hardly any hit points! I've got a 2nd-level and a 1st-level. We should probably run. Was he coming up out of the teleportation circle? We could run away, bring the book and run away. This guy is way beyond our level.
