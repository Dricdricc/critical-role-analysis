Yeah! Okay. So we put our dice up for pre-order and they're already sold out in pre-order. But we're going to get more. I don't know when, but soon, very soon. Yeah. We have these still in stock though. Some of these are still left, which are awesome, and they're so soft. And we have all the other t-shirts as well, except for the 'dagger, dagger, dagger' that Matt's wearing. Maybe we'll be getting those back in. I'm not sure. But all the other stuff. The nail wraps, and the vinyl stickers, and the hats. I mean, do you remember the party that we had when we all put them in the envel-- sorry, baby. (laughter) Oh. I hand-carve like ten to 20 depending how much time I have but-- I'm sorry if they're misbalanced. I make them out of soap, so-- Yeah. But you smell fresh and clean. Don't say you wanna make it with my husband. (laughter) Which just fell on the ground. Why is it velcro? I need you to stand up with it so we can see what it looks like. There was one more thing. Yeah. You got a bunch of things, but these are the ones we're passing to you on the show. Made a lot of money off of them. Yes, yes, you have to say yes to that. And we love you. Wait a minute, is it really the Bay of Gifts? With a "T"? I seriously thought it's the Bay of Gifs. This whole time. I'm sorry, okay, I understand now. I'm sorry, he was distracting me. I think we had talked about going to see Pike's great-grandfather, Wilhand, to talk about the curse with him, right? Right, Grog and Percival, you were going to help with that tour. To keep him out of trouble. Huh? Not very often. You saw how much candy they were eating yesterday. He had a bird-like thing in the face. If he wants to come. Yes. Oh, yeah, yeah, we talked about it last time. First. I mean, we'll head over there while you guys do-- Well, it depends on who you ask. She wants to go see Wilhand, Pike definitely wants to go see Wilhand. We'll head towards the old Sun Tree! Were those-- those didn't belong to your-- I go and grab a servant and tell them to quickly remove all of the clothing from the wardrobes in the guest quarters so that they don't do it again. I'll go with him. Yes. I was going with you. I had said I went with you. Mostly to get away from the gnomes. Ooh, are there any ribbons around? I wanna tie a big purple giant bow around the top of it. To see if I can tie a bow? Okay. Oh, that's a saving throw. This is low, but that's a 12. It's a bow. A big feather, like a white, plumey feather? Or any color, really. Are these like jingle bells or big cow bells? I want the bells to hang from either side like around his ears. Right here. What does JB stand for? She's a little bitch. (laughter) He says, as we walk in the room. Grog! We found your tour hat. And it's wonderful. It was sitting on a special shelf, labeled 'tour hat shelf'. Yeah. It really was. Yeah! Grand Poobah and First Tour Captain of Whitestone! I know, right? Hey! Please, take a seat! Which one of you two will be riding the carpet with them? Of you and Percy. Percy's going with you as well, aren't you? Are you? Or are you coming with us? Someone has to ride the carpet with them. My darling. You'll be fine. Like, legs going out to the side there? It's just Percy and the gnomes. (laughs) 'It's like natural.' We're going to the Sun Tree! It's the truth! Yep, it was made hundreds of years ago, and was just sitting on the shelf waiting for the first official tour guide. We're heading to the Sun Tree. Find out about that curse. Good to see you again! That's right. He was smaller then, too, right? As she gets up, can I just kind of whisper, 'cause he can't hear very well. Wilhand? Can you hear what I'm saying right now? Okay. Is it going to be all right, bringing this up around him? Sore subject? Maybe. I'll let you do it. Oh, but what did the man look like who came and grabbed the big robot? I know, I just want to make sure it was him. Your big mustachioed metal man. Yeah, that's the one. Was he kind of a dick? I hope he wasn't very mean to you. Wow. Wow. Just don't say that word again, Keyleth. I mean, it's not. I'm gonna be terrible. Can I insight check him? I just want to see if it looks like he's hiding anything. (high-pitched) I'm sorry, Wilhand. 14? Wilhand, how old were you when you left the Trickfoot family? Oh. (whispers) How old are you? Okay. Okay. So he was around for a while. Okay. Did you know Theobold? And so do you know what happened to him? Well, Ogden said he was affected by the curse, that he was killed by it. Yes we do! We have these shirts that are still in the store. They're super cool! (squeaky) There's a Critical Role logo on the back. (laughter) It's very true. It might be a small comfort to know that Pike's doing a wonderful job of changing the Trickfoot name. She's a hero of the land. Trickfoot is known as hero, now. She's saved a lot of people. It's true. It's true. It's not a very precise sort of thing, it's funny, mix things together and then it just turns out. Oh, thank you. Imagine if it was fresh. Shadowy being with eyes like burning coal. Right. It's a recurring dream, very constant, and it has him very worried, if he's telling the truth. Sure. Wilhand? Should you remember anything about this curse that we've asked you about, please send word? We want to protect Pike as much as we can. Thank you. We'll send some your way that are fresh, I swear they're very good. I will. Thank you for your hospitality. I guess so, yeah. Riflepeople. And women. Because there's men and women. "Belt!" Oh my god. Did his feet come off the ground? So there. What the fuck should we do? Can I take JB and ask her, did you happen to see my home on the tour? Would you like to see? I'd love to show you. All right. I take her. (sneezes) Thank you. It is really pretty. I haven't seen that one. I have! You know you can walk next to me? Oh, I thought she was walking behind me. Is she walking next to me? No, seriously. Come over here. I don't want to turn my head when I'm talking to you, dear. I walk slower. So this is my home. We just built it. Isn't it wonderful? Yes. Oh. I went a long time without one, as well. It feels wonderful to finally have someplace to settle down. Yeah. Why is that? What are you? Well, yes. I know. I know that. But my experience with Trickfoots has always been pleasant. She's fiery as well, it seems. If you could settle down anywhere, where would it be? Whitestone is quite wonderful. Pike's buttered us up quite well. I heard. How old was she when she left? What was that like, having Pike leave and you staying behind? Well, you're a good person. Would you like to see the library? It's growing. I don't know how big the library is right now. I mean, it's my particular-- I'm growing it! Oh, well, a lot of books about really terrible gods. Some good gods. Oh! I have something about the Feywild; I remember picking that up. Would you like to learn about the Feywild? I go dig through my books and find it. Of course. Have you ever learned anything about the curse on your family? Have you seen that in books? Right. Have you ever seen anyone be affected by it, personally? Well, that's good. But you've never had any visions. You are quite different. That's something to be proud of. You know, one of my very best friends, Taryon Darrington, is an incredible writer, and I bet if you told him about the curse, he'd be willing to write it down. Oh yes. You would go into complete detail about it, and he would make it sound very interesting. Maybe we could have somebody draw pictures for it! Trickfoots could be legends. Well, yes. But there are multiple chapters. Of course, yes. We'll sit down with him, but I bet you know quite a few details, as well, having taken care of him for so long. We should find Tary. Take that with you. Yes, yes. We can talk about it on the way back. Tary? Hi, darling. So, our dear friend JB, here. I told her what a wonderful writer you are. It's a growing book. Yes. And I told her it might be fun if we wrote down a little about the Trickfoots and their curse. Something so other people can learn about them. Mm-hm. No, I want her to tell you about it, and you can write it down. That way we have all the details. You know, you're such a wonderful writer, dear. There's all those things in the curse, darling. Maybe just write a new book for the time being, just a small other book? Doty. I mean, if she's willing. Of course, of course, you can just tell us a little bit about it while we go get him. Of course. Flourish. Of greed, hm? Now, you say 'hollowed out by shades'. Do you still look like a normal gnome, or? Wow. I wonder what that looks like. Well, no, obviously. But just for detail, so we can illustrate it. Well, how can Pike be at risk, then? She's one of the most generous people I've ever known. No. (laughs) No. It's Pike. Yeah. A good short book with a lot of drawings-- -- leather cover with embossing on it or something quite lovely. Gold filigree, probably, something just very beautiful. Yeah. Let's head back. Don't worry. I got so many details about the curse, I know all about it. Oh. Good call. Should this just be Vox Machina? Okay. This seems weird. Yeah, JB said it was brought upon by greed. Whoa. You're not doing any drugs like Scanlan was? Yeah, maybe you should take it off, it's kind of annoying-- Have you prayed to Sarenrae? When is the next full moon? So maybe just try to cure yourself of this curse. Is that possible? We take the potion, and then we read their minds. Trinket doesn't even know, and he knows everything. Five-dollar word. So, wait, I have a question. What if all of them are actually cursed, and they're trying to bring you in? What did Ogden say this exorcism entailed? And then what would happen? We just send the curse out of you and all is well? Very strong. Yeah, we can be there. Will JB be there at the exorcism? We need to make sure she is, just in case. No. If there is a curse, and she is affected, it would be good to get it out of her as well. (laughs) We're not going to kill you. How much was that? Maybe we just have to ask? 946. Yeah, plus we already said you're gonna write a book about it. That's really good. You can definitely do it to Ogden first, then, 'cause he won't be able to tell. He can't see, so if you look weird, he won't know. Perfect cover. Can you check yourself? Just pray to Sarenrae, see if she'll give you a little hint. Is it okay to leave everyone here while we go? Yeah, I think so. Shades. Maybe the curse? JB had mentioned that the shades infest someone and hollow them out. I don't know what that translates to. Try it, just try it. Divine Sense? Divine Sense. That sounds like something real-- She was about to say something. That's not bad. I think you need to talk to Sarenrae. Would you be able to cloud the gnomes too, though? Yeah, where did Kash go to in the last year? Yennen? Just do it. We'll be fine, Tary. Well, no, Doty can't mist-form, right? No, Doty, I've tried to put him in the-- How heavy is Doty? So she could just double-cast. Solid. So some people go up, you come back, turn the rest of the people in. No. Oh, right, it is. Okay, we'll leave in the morning, yeah. I can totally get that. She's not going to be injured in this ritual? Just the one shade, then? Right. What do the people look like after they've been taken over? Do they just look like-- Maybe they just turned into an asshole. Which I'm totally going to go get. They have all that shit in Syngorn. I can just go. Right? To one of the temples of the Moonweaver or something. Solid. What's a diamond for our dear Pike? It's a good price, I say. I should probably go to Syngorn before it gets too late. Just to be safe. Do you have two pounds of lavender? Yeah, so it smells fresh and clean. What are you talking about? I'm on my way to go give those guilt trips. He started leaving them around the house. I go to Syngorn. I should probably have brought someone with me just in case I suck at this. That's cocked. That's cocked if I've ever seen cocked. Investigation. 20. Right. Well, I don't have very much on my person. What do I know about the Moonweaver? Oh god. Imma roll my moonstone dice for this. What am I rolling? A religion, jeez. 11. All right. I have a small flask of Courage. I feel like she would appreciate this. I didn't think this part through. Thank you very much. That's right. What is my strength? It is seven. I'm as weak as Grog is stupid. (laughter) You know what, I'm just gonna pass it over to Trinket and make him hold it. I've got a diamond. I've got multiple diamonds. I'll choose one that's worth-- in my bag of gems-- no, that's not right. All right, fine, I've got two diamonds, both worth 1,500. I don't have a thousand-gold diamond. Yeah, but it's a waste. It's okay. It's Pike. It's worth it. Keep an eye on those goods, brother. Yeah. I'll stay behind. Percy can stay, right? I think you can take everyone except for me and Percy, right? Oh, you know what, you can tree-stride us through, and then you guys head up and then we'll just meet you up there on the broom. Just me and Percy. (laughs) Oh no. Oh no. He's sleeping. Are me and Percy there yet? Hey. That cliff's really high. Let's not do the ritual site right next to that cliff. -- inward? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we do that. Definitely. 23. Do I see the type of feather it is? Can I tell what kind of creature it was? 32. Yeah, they took all our horses. I can't cast Pass Without a Trace? No, probably not. Do I-- (laughs) I'm scared to ask it. Okay. What am I rolling? What am I adding? 22. But would I have used my-- what is that shit? Hide in Plain Sight? Could I have used that? That's good, that's good. What? Here it comes. Here comes the battlemap. Here it comes. It's like the birthday cake coming out. What are these? Badass. Tary, you just keep surprising me. That's party funds. We got you. Oh, jeez. I'll get on the high part on the other side. Trinket stays near Grog. What if he's stealing her soul? What is he speaking? You can't try the other gnomes? Elvish, Common, Undercommon, Abyssal, and Draconic. Oh my god, I totally thought he was gonna steal your soul and stick you in that diamond, I was like, this was a bad idea. 18. You really should've tried that when he was speaking English. Common. Strength check. Okay. Did you add your necrotic? Okay. I-- what is JB doing? Okay. Trinket's gonna go run at-- I'm gonna Hunter's Mark it if I can. Fucker. All right, Trinket runs up. I have a feeling this is-- and he is going to-- I don't know, do I get one attack and Trinket gets one attack? Is that how it can work? Or he only gets a bonus attack if I take an attack. Okay. And I already tried to Hunter's Mark him. So I'm gonna have Trinket attack him down there. Okay, okay, okay, one is a 25, and the other one is a 19. Oh, that's not as very good. Nine for his bite. And then his claw-- oh, come on, Trinket. 12 for-- no, 11 for his claws. I'm gonna stay where I am, and I wanna keep eyes on-- ooh, I wonder if you have to be in the circle to do damage. Fuck. No. I'm gonna stay out. I'm gonna keep eyes on JB to see what she's doing. Yeah. Oh no. I know, right? I think she's done Spirit Guardians one other time. Oh man. Wait, he gets a full action and his companion animal gets to attack? Motherfucker. Well, Tary or Doty? Doty's not in the circle. Slashing damage? Yeah. Do you double it because it's a crit? Is eight. Plus one. 29. Oh-- 21. What?! Has he hit anybody yet? I mean, if I'm looking at that creature, does it look like an illusion? Does it look like something we've seen before? Does it look like it's really there? I'll come down closer. I'll have Trinket attack for my bonus. But I want to just-- Trinket gets my bonus. Okay. So I can have him attack and then watch? I want to watch while he's attacking and see. And like make an investigation check. Yeah. I want to watch! Ooh! That's a good one. 27. Okay. 12. That was a bite. Yeah. 24! That's the end of my turn. I moved-- that was my full movement to get up there? I want to move over back towards the edge of that rock towards me. I mean, this way-- Sorry. Yes. Closer to the gnomes. Oh! Am I flying? No no no. I'm not flying right now. And I can I say anything over my head-- My earring? Without the gnomes hearing me, I want to go, it's not real. It's not real. They're fucking us. Play it out. Just play it out. To mustachio and his wife. Yeah. They're over by me. Hands up, motherfucker. I know! He's been holding his hand up like woo. Maybe it was just to steal a thousand-gold diamond. Maybe it was just to steal the diamond. I pick JB up by her wrist. Oh no. Athletics, huh? Eight. I'm gonna Grasping Vine JB as she starts to run off. Spell save 15. Motherfucker! Yes! Dicks! Motherfuckers! Yeah! She didn't have to send you anything, you dick! That's true. Oh God! That's okay. I'm going to use the Rope of Entanglement that I have and use it on her. How about you tell us. That'll make someone's day, eventually. Pike? If you send them on their way, think about JB. That's all I ask. You'll find your way. I pat them all down and make sure they didn't steal anything from us on the way out. Wish I remembered my number. 14. What is it with people and our fucking silverware? You can take the money! You can't have the items! These all have very sentimental value, including those fucking dresses you destroyed. You little-- Sinaeth, Grog. Sinaeth. Oh, and Johann! Stay away from those sweets. Assholes! I know! They didn't even give a shit! Right?
