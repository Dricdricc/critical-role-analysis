But Travis plays the lead villain! Yeah, I think you hear me barfing a lot during that game. Yeah! Crazy. You should play some Borderlands. We're growing! We're learning and growing. A wild Scanlan coming next to me. Yeah, I was on that side. Nothing. (chuckles) Ugh! That's zero. Nah, it's smooth as a baby's bottom. Fine leather. That's what your face feels like. Yeah, we can stay there for free. Oh, Scanlan. You've just missed Pike! You probably should have done that. Oh, you weren't? Well, then. That sounds like a wonderful time. It's all right that you missed Pike. What did you do for all the days we've been gone now? All right. That's wonderful. Oh no. Scanlan, you've missed everything! So they killed the carpet. It lives no more. They also spent a lot of money. But hey, they didn't die, and that's a good thing. A demon. Thank you. That is a good question. We did not have him with us then? We didn't have him with us when we had the feast? You didn't think of him at the time? What? Well, okay. Here's the thing. If we're going to go home-- Emon. Right. If we're going to go home, I would really, really like to stop by Kraghammer. Yes. 25,000 gold. So you want to go in the Crucible again. Tiberius, do you have any wineskins or anything? Do you have a wineskin? Who did you just-- who did you just-- What was your mother's name? Yes. We did. I go up and I tell Tiberius, maybe it's best just to keep a low profile for a while. And I turn around and wave at the Bastions. Cool. That was fun. Yeah, I'll Hunter's Mark one of them. Oh, wait. Can they feel that? Oh gosh. Wait, which one should I roll first? Okay. Hold on. Natural 20, what! Alive! Alive. The ones that I'm keeping an eye on? Can I try, subtly, to pass off my ring of AC to Grog? No. It doesn't, I don't think. Hold on, let me look. Ring of Protection. It just says plus two bonus to AC and saving throw-- oh, requires attunement. Damn it! I'm sorry, Grog. You shouldn't have taken off running! No, don't use magic! Personal funds?! That's normal. He probably has more than that. I'm going to bet. I'm going to bet. I'm going to put 600 on Philip! It's inspiration. 1d-what? Two? He's been training! I get up on Trinket's shoulders and cheer. Yeah, can we? Grog. Oh god. Mother bitch! But back up? So he shouldn't be halving his die? Got it. Sorry. Batman! 12. It's so brutal! You suck, Kern! Do you get an advantage at all? (shouting) I saw that, Kern! Oh, Kord. That is painful. Nope. I lift up my shirt and I say, I love you, Grog! Never mind! I put my shirt back on. 600 gold! Oh my god. Just hit him. Did I show my boobs?! Yeah. I am, too. You know what's so great about that, Grog? You said you were going to pay back the gold you lost me in the first fight. All right! Greyskull Keep! Good luck with your dick, by the way. Sorry about that. Fuck yeah! Oh, he would never do that. I believe you are mistaken, actually. Can I back him up? Deception. Oh, that's so high! What's going on? You were arrested? Why? You tried to talk out what? Can I track them? 16. Can we go over and knock? Hi, yes. I'm looking for-- (sighs) I'm looking for a couple of people. They're actually mental patients, and they've gotten loose. Oh! That's them, I'm afraid. Cheaters? Well, that makes sense. They don't understand normal social rules. You see what I'm talking about? 24. I can imagine it would be, yes. Oh, he's my lawyer. Actually, for a small-- never mind. I noped myself on that one. Here you are, 500 gold. You guys! What were you trying to do? Cast magic? He won! Let's go get your winnings, because I think that should cover the amount I just spent on getting you out of jail. That's true. She bought a couple of nice meals for you. So I guess I broke even. Cheers! Good apple juice. (stuttering) Money? Kraghammer? Right. 'Cause they have magic things. You didn't see them! You were behind me, so shut up. What are you doing all the way over there, anyway? How about no? I was caught up in a moment of passion! I'm sorry! Anything for you and for the 600 gold that that I put on your fight. On your body? So we gotta stop into Emon first. 25,000. Oh, bartender! Yes. That bearded, hooded gentleman at the end of the fight, yeah? The one that everyone was quiet for. What? Who? Who is he? I'm not. And he nodded! What does that mean? What is it, Percy? Would you like me to go with you, Grog, as your manager? Let's go! You guys are recovering from your drink. Very similar to the ones surrounding you. Ugh, haggle him down. I'm not there. Earthbreaker Groon! Just to talk to him, because he likes Grog. Yes, we are here to pay homage to Earthbreaker Groon with the latest champion of the city. Of the Crucible. You know. Oh, yeah, like what? Ten feet? Yeah? Very pretty. (whispering) He's not very good at talking. Would you like someone to come and translate for him? Is that a yes? Okay, sorry. Yeah this really not the kind of-- Yeah. They don't like talking. (whispers) You've got to go. No. Just go. Is that a pig's head? Tattooed on his fucking wrist. Right here? (whispers) Sigil. Down over by the bad lands? We can just pop over to Emon. The airship was only going to take us to Emon, anyway. Good thinking, Tiberius! So it's okay, we popped out. Is the same guy there? Five days. Trinket is with us. Yeah, but it would have dropped us off in Emon anyway. I pop on out and I say, hello again. Yes, we have. This time, of course, you already know ahead of time that we are dear friends of Uriel, and we do not need to. I was saying, Percy is so good at paperwork. He's going to be super pissed. Tiberius is helping. Thank you so much. A real pleasure. Thank you. Thank you so much. Emon is so beautiful-- What time of day is it? You are so good, you. I'm not drunk. What? What is that? I immediately go over there and throw open the-- Grog the Victorious. Get it right. Oh, darling! You're so brave and strong. Butchering, I believe. You are? I'm using insight on him as he's talking. And you're touching my dice! If he's a level one, you killed him. Hi, darling. Why? How could you do that to him? Kynan. Oh, you'd better roll good because I'm going to be so mad at you if you hurt him. Why did you have to knock him out?! We could have trained him! Yeah, we're walking inside. He won't. Maybe for the future, don't do that until we tell you it's okay to do that? No, he's fine. It's just, maybe we wanted to take a little nap or something. Feeling guilty that you knocked him out, brother? Here's the thing, Scanlan, how do you look through your poo? Can you look through it anywhere, or is it perhaps from the-- Just concentrate for a moment and see what she's doing. Tell us what you see. Unless she's naked, in which case, stop looking. What did you see? Anytime you want. Ooh! Any time ever? Thank you, Erwen. Fried chicken. Does he want some fried chicken? Still? What say you, Percy? Seven days in a week or in a week, like five days? Got it. Percy-- Don't worry, Grog. We have a wonderful tailor. In your Bag of Holding. He's good. Oh, but I want to talk to Percy! Yeah, that needs to happen.
