Just hanging out. What's this? Dude, they were so good! And they give really good background into our characters. What animal was that? Yes! So our critical costumes contest. We are announcing the winners after the break! No, we have all been looking at them. We all have our personals, but now we have to fight amongst ourselves and duke it out for the winner. They are amazing! Victor cat! Critter Critters! When does it start? Yeah, he's old school. He's old school. He's off-camera laughing at us. We should go to Fort Daxio then. And talk to them. By the fabulous Keyleth. Can you scry here though? We are by the Orb of Death. Yeah. We are totally going to Fort Daxio. That's where we are going to amass our forces. Potentially. We do? My shit father? Yeah, he knew somebody there, but I don't remember who it was. Oh! Oh! What about that guy that was running the refugee camp? The leader! Bernard, or Reginald, or-- Not Reginald. What was his name? Bernard? The guy who was running the refugee camp that was like a blacksmith, not a blacksmith, but he had stepped up to-- No. Yeah. We found his brother? His son? They were heading to Fort Daxio, weren't they? Yeah. Well, they're empty right now. But you know who I'm talking about. Yeah? Cornelius. Is Allura still here? Is Allura still around? Allura, do you know anyone in Fort Daxio? Right. Shit. No. The army, remember, part of the army got sent to Syngorn, and then Syngorn bamfed away. This is a lot of work. Should we just fucking go there? I don't know if he knows army people. Yeah. That's true. Are there trees? Are there lots of trees? It's grassland. One? Why one? It seems like a really long process-- Well, one of us goes there, finds a tree and then bamfs back, and Keyleth brings us all over-- Fabulous. Send one of us over there. Oh! How perfect! We're good. Great. Kima! Can we take Kima? No. This is perfect. Yeah, it's fine. Let's just go. Wow, that is way bigger than I expected it to be. Wow! Have we ever rolled this? Oh my God, you've got really good animal handling! Is it a dick? Does it look like anybody's in the fort looking down at us? Are we far enough away? Fucking shit balls. 16. All right. It's shit-balls up there. Just lots of shit. We're not bringing the fight here. Oh shit, we are. That's the plan, that's my plan Daxio's, who's in Syngorn. No, it is! And we have got Allura with us; she's on the council. Super good. But they might be skittish, so we should probably have a little protection as we go up there. Dudes. I think their commanding officers are in Syngorn. For the most part. Sure. They didn't even check us out; just letting us in. Be on your guard. They're too trusting. Never mind! They're in Syngorn. As far as we know. Elle Gorgofon? 50 people. Toilet paper. (laughter) Can we see what it is? It looks like dark folded material? General, how many soldiers does this fort support? And how many can be here? Yeah. (quietly) All right. In your Warmaster's defense, it might be beyond his control to get back here. And he's stuck in the Feywild. The Warmaster, here. Yeah, Mikael. Maybe throw some food through a tree when we open it up, just chuck some corn. Take some spaghetti! Sorry. You've been under him for how long? 15 years. Long time. That was a good catch. We're hoping we'll be able to bring Mikael and Syngorn's army back as well. Not even a little bit. Three down. Do you have underground facilities? Something that guards against dragon fire? How many non-functional? It could happen. When was the last time ancient dragons took over the land? The montage? We need some source of water, too. Could they have something with veggies, too, though? Isn't there something that turns the land fertile? It's a Sizzler. I like it. (phone ringing) Oh, you did? We have to, right? I don't know how we send word to the Feywild without going to the Feywild. Didn't we do underground stuff in Whitestone, too, though? Do they disappear when they're dead? Oi. Maybe we should pop into Syngorn. But yeah, we'll fly up. Let's do that. Because it's on the cliffside, right? (sings) From a distance... (shouts) It looks peaceful up here. What are we doing? Do we see anything interesting? That seems useful, for, like, if we put something on the cliffside or something? Maybe a hideout, somewhere to hide from view, something like that? Almost awesome. 19. Is it a mountain? Is it favored terrain? Yeah. 20. We could put somebody in a hidey-hole up here. And if they see anything, they drop a stone down to a designated area and let people know. Oh yeah! We have those. A bell is probably the best idea. Oh, because your little wings are dead? All right. I'll float us down on my ever-flying broom. I go down pretty slow to make this last a little bit longer. What? To take out all of this? Yeah. That's right. Oh, that was so close to a one, but it wasn't! 20. Oh, wait, no! 26! My math was wrong. There's still no veggies, huh? They could probably use some vegetable nutrition. Do they? Or is it like a chicken broth that they boil them in? Deep in there. Oh, Percy! Number one. (whispers) Never say "Whitestone" in public, ever. Or Allura. To the Feywild? But how would we get back? Maybe Syngorn will have control over that. They can transfer back when they want to. They have a huge army. I don't know how we'll be able to get word to them. All right. Well, we have to get armies here. That's what we're trying to do. They were wandering somewhere specific, though. Into the riverlands or something? We'll spread the fuck out and then Thordak will attack and then none of us will be here! -Ish. Yeah. Bottom of the list, because I don't think they would-- Yes. And that's a biggie because it's also got these soldiers. Also there. We can howl. Bahamut? Yeah, we've got that whistle. What about Bahamut's people in Vasselheim? Yeah, what about the Platinum Sanctuary? Oh, I thought you were talking about-- Sorry, Grog. You're so smart! Yeah, it's so close. I think so. I don't know. I think they just wanted out of those woods, but-- Maybe we could find Artagan while we're there. Maybe he could pop over and we'll have an archfey helping us. A jillion. As many as we can. Is that it? Is that everyone? Vasselheim. This is a lot of different places in like a day and a half. Yeah. And hopefully they'll show up like Game of Thrones at the last moment. We'll think we're overrun, and then all of a sudden another army shows up, and it's wonderful! Oh, this is major! This is huge! Remember demons in the succubus' house? Well let's send word to them. Then save us the talk. Yes. It's got to be somebody she knows. Have you ever met somebody in charge in Kraghammer? Yeah, they have Fassbender. Wow, nice pull! Yeah, she is. The Clasp. Well, who do you know that's really powerful, that also maybe has an army that could help us? Anyone you know that we don't? They're dicks, aren't they? Oh, that one guy we met, he was a real dick, though. Purple eyes. He was in Marquet. Is that what we're thinking of? Am I thinking of a different place? Just kidding! Yes, if they could get pop Syngorn over to Fort Daxio, that'd be killer. No. No. Tell them to be on guard! On the airship? Or send them through a tree. I don't know if that will help at all. Yeah. He's protecting everyone. Oh my god is this happening right now? She goes back we're like-- It might be smart to send one to Warmaster Mikael as well. I know he's in Syngorn as well, but it might be good to have a couple of people there bringing word. They hate us, but-- If the dragon leaves the city. Yeah. They're just resistant to fire. Are they vulnerable to anything that i know of? Of the Dawn Martyr. Which might be clutch for you. We'd have to spend the night there. Fuck, really? Right. You'd have to ask Raishan. Oh, fuck! Asum was going to come back! Fuck. Some other guy. Was it some other guy? Well it's still a day. It hasn't been a day yet. We haven't spent the night here yet. Somebody's got to go. Well, all right. That's the goal. We kill the peons, and then he comes. That's why we need to have a lot of people here. To fight them. That's what we talked about. All right. Allura, can you send a message to Gilmore, or Cassandra, or Kima even? Maybe just those three. They're the only ones who know about Raishan. Let them know that Raishan is bringing back Asum. I know, but just to make sure everything's fine with that. No. What are we going to do? She's not going to come. Would you want to go, Allura? All right. Okay, then you stay here and keep running things. Is this stupid? Are we going to die in the Fire Plane? But there's a Vestige there for Pike. The thing is, Thordak's going to send out look-sees like he did over Whitestone, as soon as he finds out Umbrasyl is dead. It doesn't mean he'll launch an attack, because where is he going to attack? He doesn't know where we are. We just bamf right back! If you hear back from anyone in Syngorn or anyone anywhere, will you send us a message? Pretend like we were never here. Let them know. Pretend like we were never here. All right. We are so stupid. This is going to be fun. No, it's a tree stride. No, I think we should. Because they were there. Can you Plane Shift us over to the Ashari? It has to be to another plane. Just something little? So that we can pop to the tree? Oh, yeah. So let's fucking do it. Look at that! Keyleth! There's so many more people than you thought! Wasn't the ember seed connected to the-- Didn't we knock down some pillars when we came to the Fire Plane the last time? Isn't that part of the reason his hold was broken? Right. But remember, we were here for your-- Okay, maybe you just thought that and were freaking out a bit. Is it a large city? It feels like it's going to be really hard. Yeah, whatever we're doing. Even if we're in the middle of fighting some really big fire elementals we just-- Scanlan, will you be able to do the mansion inside of the Fire Plane? Or did you already use it-- No, I mean, but did you already use it today? Does everything over there fight with fire? The City of Brass sucks, but we'll be okay going there, ish? In and out. Thank you so much. Can I say while this whole talk's been going on, that I've been unattuning my coldsnap armor and reattuning my bracers of archery? Can I ask you a question? If I have two bows that are awesome, and I'm attuned to both of them, how easy is it to switch in a battle? Yeah. If I chose to attune to the Sky Sentinel and Fenthras instead of the bracers? It'd be an action to switch them out in a battle? Cool. Hey! That all happened in a millisecond. I was considering things in my brain. Oh, right! With the announcement of our winners! Yeah, because we've been looking at the hashtag like crazy. My personal choice was @sara-rokhov! I don't know if I said that right, but she did the costume that was closest to the outfit that we wore in the opening credits, which is really cool because I know that's really intricate, and I saw the sleeves. There was crazy pleated sleeves happening on that costume! It was awesome! Upper crust? That was so cool! Good concept. So good! Close up on all of us looking at each other like, who's it going to be? Amazing weapon. And just so you know, all of you winners, @CriticalRole on twitter will follow you so you can DM your mailing address and get your wonderful prizes. Oh, god. Some prizes may include part of my dice hoard. Oh no, oh no, oh no! Okay, City of Brass, City of Brass, here we go. Yeah, right? It's a concentration spell, or else I would've taken it too. You can't do it with anything else. What's our Jenga? "Super Jenga" means everybody run towards each other and link hands. Yeah. 27. Basically. They're really powerful. Should we go and talk to them? You are really good. Go talk to them, Scanlan. Be super cool. Oh, Jesus! I keep a hand on the bow, just in case. Steady. Oh, fuck! They're so big. Ever. What is it? (distressed sounds) So like, money? Is it money, then? Or would you rather gems? Should I just, you know what, fuck it? I'm going to put the 20-pound bag of gems in his hand. The world is fucking ending, you guys. How else am I going to use these things? Scanlan, I think you let a little bit of scry on the ground there. Fuck. Oh, wait! Because I took a spell. Locate Object. Oh, okay. Right? How many miles is the city? Maybe we should ask somebody. Not necessarily. Act really fucking tough, dude. 15. Let's find that armor. Yeah, we walk the fuck forward. Should we get a little farther into the city or should I cast it right now? Oh, wow. That might be the worst shirt you've ever worn on the show. Wow. As long as, you know, nothing attacks us. Right. That's clutch. Flying creatures here? Maybe wyverns or something? A teeny, tiny efreeti. Tieflings? Can we also keep an eye out for anything flying? I want to see if anything's flying around the city at all. No warning, huh? Are they looking and talking to each other at all? What does "avian" mean? Oh, got it. Harry Potter! Okay! Oh. Intelligence? Ew. Eight? That's a fucking bird, y'all! Ah! Natural 20 on the-- Every time. Get a little closer. I'm going to try to keep a little closer to the two in the front and try to see if I can overhear their conversation at all if they talk. This is like when your friends start to drink at the Ren Faire and you're like, should we keep going forward, or what do we do, do we wait? Oh no. Oh, it's at disadvantage. Come on, Keyleth! Oh shit. Okay. I go. I don't know, I don't fucking know! So it's me and you. Are you coming? Are you still in the middle? Dart to the right. I go. The efreeti behind us, are they paying attention to us, or are they completely distracted by all of the-- Anything? Oh god. Do they know they're being dominated? Come on, Keyleth! You got it. Get up and run, you guys. You better fucking run away. It's crazy city, people fight all the time. We're heading towards an alleyway. Do we need to hide? Let's go as far away out of sight as we can. I think that's the option. Everybody's running for their lives right now. Sorry. Hi. How are you not slaves right now? Sorry. Can I climb up on one of the boxes to give more foot room? I pick up Scanlan and put him up on a box. Yes, this is true. Why do you wear those white robes? Do they signify anything? Whoa, you've got really high insight. Magic! And I think Magical Beasts. Is this your room? Whose room is it? I want to look in his eyes as we are about to go through and see if-- how honest he looks. 21. Hey, my eyes are down-- All right. I like your hair. And I walk in. I walk up and smack Percy on the ass and say, "Feel like making a home here?" and walk past him. How long does Locate Object take to cast? Can I try to cast it as we sit down and see if it's in our vicinity? Well, it's a 2nd-level spell, so I can do it a bit. Tight, tight, tight. Did he hang out around here? Hmm. Anywho! What powers can you do? A trinket, really. Nothing huge. Somebody won it in a game of poker, I believe? Cards? I don't think so. Do people under subjugation own a lot?" Where's Uten? What's Uten doing? He seems totally chill? This is the way this dude talks all the fucking time? (laughing) Do you require monetary compensation, or is it something more? Should we make ourselves not look like us? Should we maybe look like something different? In which case, take your pick. Don't you have any white robes you can give us instead? Check out those chains and see if they're magic? You can get big and then look like an efreeti? Maybe somebody that is better at talking? I want to put them on, but I don't want to click them. I want to hang them and make them look like they're attached, but I don't want to attach them. 11? You're going to blow your little hands off. Oh. I must have not attached them quite right. Oh, no, that's okay. I am. You fucking dick!
