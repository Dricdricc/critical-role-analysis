Where is he? Is that where he's at? I don't know where he is. What is his mother's name!? It's Lenore! I know it. It's Scanlan's mom-- Wow, really? It's sad. Shaka, man, oh yeah. (laughter) What about Black Widow? Do they have Black Widow? Hell yeah, they do. Yay, thanks, Marvel Puzzle Quest! (high-pitched) Hey, there's stuff in the store, you guys! You should go look in the store and see what is there. You're welcome. It's going to be epic. I'm so excited! Oh yay! No! No! Hey, look at this cool dice bag I have, it's got a bear! Damn it. [opening credits] You get another thing?! That's your mantle! Wait. Is it a cloak? Don't you already have a cloak on? But can I go talk to Keyleth, actually? I did want to ask you-- Are you allowed to leave? How does this work, exactly? Should we talk to your dad? All right. Ah, they were talking all about you, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's this whole conversation about you. No, I heard she was saying how much she admired you, and he was saying, "Er. I don't think "I feel it as much," and she was like, "No, really, Dad, you just need a chance to really talk to him," and he was like, "No, just believe me, I did talk to him, and I don't feel that way." And then she was like-- Never mind. (laughter) They actually said that, as well. They were talking about how amazing I am. (laughter) Yeah, are we doing this? Tomorrow morning, we're heading out to hell. First things first what, Grog? Oh, she's got Plane Shift, right? No ships. Well, we know the city that we want to go to. Dis city. We could pop into it. We could pop out of it. It's very ordered. However, Scalebearer, big high guy. Really important guy said not to make a scene. He said if we make a scene, that would go poorly. I think he's probably kind of powerful. Might be hard to lift him up. You have? Morning! Morning has come! I mean, is it similar to the City of Brass? It sounds so similar. But we are not devils. Therefore, weak and liable to be taken as slaves. So the person that we made a contract with was a devil that ended up being the one that killed Pike, right? That was a devil disguised as a demon? Okay. Yeah, we don't have a wish. Okay, so we make no deals when we go. No deals. No contracts. No shaking of hands. No signing of anything. Oh no. Don't touch anything. That we can wear over those gloves. No, Tary, no signing anything. No signing of contracts. Although I'm sure you're good at reading contracts as well. Yes. You can read them, but don't sign them. How about that? No. No signing. (laughter) And we come back here. I don't even remember he signed a contract. I feel like that could be very dangerous, for one person to go in alone. Grog, no. Last time you were alone-ish, you almost killed two guards. In Vasselheim. Right. You could always look in Doty's diary and find out exactly what happened. Fu Manchu? Oh really? Actually, I know that from reading a lot about the Raven Queen. I can answer that for you. I'm sorry. Keep going. Well, that's difficult. That's difficult. (laughter) Yeah. Yeah. Ashley is in New York. (laughs) No, it's Ashley's character, though. No, but I mean, it could be, we don't know. Definitely. I'm liking it more. Are you sure-- okay. So we should just go down, act like we're evils, like our souls have been claimed by another devil already. Can't they see through that? Okay. Maybe you could be our conduit, the person that brings us to-- Sure. Wait, wait, Tary. Do you have anything, like a spell you can make, any kind of trinket, (laughs) that would help Keyleth be better at lying? Well, not that, no. I'm talking an actual like ability to tell lies better. Something that would up her maybe charisma? That's better. That's perfect, that's perfect. Seriously? Seriously? Yeah. All right. Did you ever get a response from Sam on his potions? So, I didn't want to tell. Oh. I didn't know you wrote it down, Grog. You can't count. Okay, we gotta pass these potions out. Who wants a superior? Yeah. Yeah, Tary gave them to me. Did you steal them from me when I wasn't noticing? Because if you did I would have perceived it. Yeah, I would have. Because I have really high perceiving. Yeah. I don't want you dying again. Take the superior. Is that all right with everyone? Really, Tary? Because you have all those patches, I thought that's the reason you gave them to us. Do you want two regular potions, how is that, Tary? Is that good for you? In addition to your patches? Or would you want one of the greaters that you bought for us? Wow, all right, sure, take it back. Okay, I'll take a greater as well. Good call. Greater for Grog. So that's all three greaters taken. Two regulars for Percy, two regulars for Keyleth. And that's-- well, that's two regulars left. Okay, so Grog. You have two regulars and one greater. All right. He keeps calling him that. What about Von? What about Musel? Infernal. But they speak Common, I'm assuming, as well. Ah, shit. We don't know anybody who speaks Infernal, do we? Why did you take one of the greaters if you can make healing potions on your own? Right. Oh, yeah! Understandable. Man-spreading. No. I speak Abyssal, but that's the other ones. A succubus. Tight, then make yourself a succubus. I really want to see what you look like as a succubus, personally. Oh, but that's different than knowing their language. No, we can't hire anyone! Why can't we just a hire a tiefling? Don't you have any other tieflings in your tribe? Aw, that's great. I think we go. So go in the morning, find out. If not, we'll just go there and hope that someone speaks Common. Yeah. It's just hell. No big deal. Fine. Ish. The fucking deal that I made with your fucking goddess. Who knows if she'll call us out on it, but. There's that. Well, hell no. She creeps me out. I saw her face. It's fucking weird. Yeah, that happened. Did you know we saw her? The giant white mask? I feel like Grog's getting more-- I feel like you're lying more now than you used to. I actually understood it. How fucked-up is that? This is true. I mean, we're all here. Oh, wow, this is happening. (laughs) Good one, Grog. I mean, yeah. I'm going to hopefully build up my small house. No, no, it needs to be. I don't know who that is. I would love to know what that is. I feel like the Grey Hunt is something really terrible and you just haven't told me. Do I get a jolly hat out of it? Meet something? Do I get really high? Is this the whole point of the Grey Hunt? Do I have to find the highest animal in the woods? Oh, wow. Do I go alone or do I get help? Oh, shit. Sounds fun. I look forward to it. Look, my light-up 20 just lit up for no reason as we were talking about it. I think it'll go very well. Don't look at me. Can we go to bed? It's windy. You're up on a cliff. That's gross. He's just been drinking mayo. (laughs) That's so gross. All right. Oh, cool. Yeah, it does. It sounds like Klingon. Emphasis on "THOK". (laughter) (whispers) Insight check. Episode 91, where we force Matt to make up an entire language on the spot. Yai equals yes. Nai. Nern. (laughter) No, not 'ermahgerd'! No he is not. Oh. My. God. That's canon. Thanks a lot, Liam! We're not here, so don't worry. We're not having this conversation in front of her. For the past 20 years. You should ask, like, how to say 'Don't fuck with me.' Ermahgerd. Kathrek. Kuthrek. It's koothrek. What is it? No! Did you learn all of the language? Well, tell us what you learned so that we can speak it too. Kuthok. Got it. Got it. Check. It's like 'yay', only kind of weird. I think probably, 'Do you speak Common?' Well, yeah. What's her mother's name? Did you learn how to say 'Leave us alone'? That works. It's the Nine fucking Hells, nobody says please and thank you. Check! This is great. All right, we should probably go. Uh-huh. You've got to be, like, so cool. You've got to be the coolest. I know, we could all die. Let's do this. Let's build Dis city. (sings) Let's go to Dis city. Oh, shit. I mean, I was kind of joking, but sure. Let's go. What is this? What is this creepy, weird-- Who Dis? Who dat? Oh god. Wait, I have a question! We did a Heroes' Feast last night, right? I thought we said we were going to do it! I thought we were going to do it! Didn't we say we were going to do it?! I thought we said it in the last game. Shit balls mother bitch fuck balls! Ah, that's some of my favorite wood right there! It should be 'ermahgerd,' but whatever. Fight! Yeah, we did. (whispers) Dis tower. Let's put our hoods and cloaks on. Weren't you going to make yourself look like a tiefling? Can I see if anybody is watching right now? Is there a-- I mean, iron tower? I thought you said an eye on a tower, and I was like, that's a different tower. Can I perceive anywhere that looks like where travelers would stay? 30. Oh crap! Ow, ow, ow, ow. Oh my gosh. Good thing rubber doesn't exist here. Well. I don't know what to do other than to-- Does it look like there's anybody around us that can see us? Anybody watching? I mean, I'm glancing subtly, trying to look like a badass but also stealthy. 18. Okay. Is it like that thing we ran into in-- Was it Kraghammer? Where were we where that thing was like a mash of bones and stuff? Is it like that? Okay. Ew! You can't even see legs! That seems awful. Wait, imma put my glasses on so I can see it again! Oh, you already closed it. Oh my gosh. That is so creepy. Okay. Do I see anything that looks like normal Exandrians? People that are just like-- Right. I go back to our group and say, well, I was spotted for sure. Nobody seemed to pay me very much mind, but there's nobody here that looks like us. I don't know if we've happened to pop into a particular area of the city that is inhabited mostly by devils, but that's where we are. Yes, the market. Oh, right. Oh, that's true, you would know! I feel like we should put our hoods up and just generally act like we belong here. Can you do it quickly? I mean-- We're in an alleyway. Can you just lean in front of Keyleth? Put some mayonnaise on it, you'll feel better. Can you imagine how sour Grog must smell all the time? He just has mayonnaise on him. I want to be one. No, change it up-- stop, Taryon! Two more people. (laughs) Kidding, he knew. Yeah, Grog can look like Grog. But make him more red. Pink! No no, we need to get a-- we need to eat. Okay, well that'd-- concentration? Yeah, and then we'll just Alter Self again. White? Way to totally blend in. Good job, rogue. Lillith was an albino? That's why she was so pale. I'm not. I'm not! Act like you belong here. Act tough and cool. Oh no! Act like you belong. People will buy it. We just walk looking straight ahead; don't look around too much. The tower's in every direction. I feel like only if it's called for, yeah? No, probably not just yet. I know, they could, but they also thrive on order. And I feel like that's a little out of order. Me too. Keep doing that. Yeah. It's concentration. (gasps) Maybe we can drop a little bit of dust of tracelessness behind us, though, so we're-- no? I'm going to keep an eye out for anybody that looks like they're noticing us too much, anything. Of course. Oh god. That's really sad. Does it look like people are coming in and out of that building? Maybe we can post up and see, or just walk on in. Well, our surroundings are changing, we're just not-- As soon as he opened the door, I wanted to get a look inside of where he came out. It was almost a 20, but it was a 25. Fuck. Where's a fucking place we can have a stupid feast? You need something-- They see me-- no. Do I see any buildings that look like people are coming in and out raucously? He's going to keep an eye out for anybody watching us. While I'm looking for buildings. I could fly up in the air and see if I can spot a market. Was that what did it? No, it's always off to the side, right? How about I watch any of the people, the humanoids, or anything like that, that are together-- Can I see them talking, does it look like any of them are speaking Common, if I'm trying to read their lips-- I'll walk in the direction, just get in the area that they're in, so that I can try to read their lips. That's cocked. (deep voice) 27. 17. That was bad. The Fetters? I still can't see what they have in the cage? I'm going to walk up to them. Before they walk away. I'm going to be casual as I do it. I just walk up. I don't even look at the cage at all, like I don't give a shit about it. And I walk up and I say-- Oh! Are you with me? I signal at you to come over. I don't want to look like I'm talking to the people, yet. I'm just walking in their direction, and I lean over to my brother and say, God I hate this place, don't you? (exhales) It's so hot. I wish we were back home. Right. I make eye contact with the woman as I say it. 30-- no, 20-- 21. Can I help you? You were staring at me, darling. Oh, you had claimed it. Sorry. Everything here's claimed. That didn't go as well as I planned. (laughs) I just want to find a fucking tavern! Yeah, but as they walk away I want to look at the fucking cage and really get a good look at what they had. All right, before they walk off I go, oi! You made a deal for that one yet? Where do you go? I have something I'd like to sell as well. It's not working. I'm trying so hard. (whispers) Oh god! Yes, I am whispering to you. It didn't work. We find other people. I mean, do I see a tavern around here? It seems like a busy sort of street. Percy, where are you going? I follow in the general direction of those people that walked off. You said they split off? They split away from each other? We step off to the side. Not the one! Not that one! It doesn't mean it's the pit fiend. Ugh, this is like Hellraiser! Oh, it's a buddy movie! Well, you are quite lovely, brother. Into the tavern? It's up ahead. I glance back and see them. Yeah. I stand outside the tavern with Grog and wait for everybody to get inside. Ohh-- (shuddering noise) Oh, yeah yeah yeah. Should we-- I just walk up. I'm just going to ask for a room, and just go up. Oh my god. Kuthok. Rooms. No more, Keyleth. No more eye contact. Do you have rooms available? Organ? As he's talking, I turn around and lean against the table that he's talking over and see who he's looking at. Well yeah, but I'm going to act totally calm about it. I think he might be the owner. Can we insight check the guy we're talking to? Okay. Sure, why not! Here we go. Yeah, yeah that's good. 17. Wait, before he walks away. How long have you owned this space? Who runs it, then? I'm curious, big man. That's all. (squeaking noises) 18. Let's get up to the rooms. I want Tary to identify it once we get up to the rooms. Don't, don't. Not yet, Keyleth. You ate a soul, Keyleth?! Oh my god! Let's go up to the room. No, no, Tary! Let's go upstairs. No, we've got one for each of us. I open up the bag of colding and just like put my face next to it. No, I just want to breathe in the cold. Wait, should we all go to one room, then? And I want to look all around the room and see if anybody's watching, if there's any kind of holes in the wall. 13. Yeah, we were close there. Not yet. Just hold on one second. Maybe I'd cast Identify on those, just before you eat another one. Wow. Okay, Keyleth, okay. (laughs) You just ate a person! You just ate people. (gasps) Well, it was fragments, so maybe it's only like five souls, completely? But does it heal you? What do the fragments do? I mean do the soul fragments just like-- -- do you just feel better, are you healed or are you just not hungry anymore? Well, we're about to have a Heroes' Feast. Back to the plan. Okay, scry. Let's scry on Hotis. Let it settle. Grog, do you want to keep leaning against the door, maybe? I'm just afraid-- I feel really uncomfortable in here. Are there windows in the room at all? Okay. Maybe Doty can lean against the door? Stand in front of the-- Does he take fire damage? Okay. Oh shit, that's kind of cool. Don't touch Doty! Oh no. We're going to scry on Hotis. It's okay, it was already dead, Keyleth. Or maybe it was like the soul gems. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm kidding, kidding, I'm totally kidding. Yeah, it was probably a really bad person, and now they're inside of you. So, cast it at a higher level. At what level? We can be. Do we know if the Nine Hells have day and night the same way-- Does this place have day and night the same way? Yeah, but are we going to scry first? Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah! Shit! Eat it, Hotis! MARISHA and Eat that scry! Oh god, he is. And then being stabbed by Scanlan. (high-pitched) Rakshasa! Anything else? Anything else? Anything else? Did you see anything else? Or become police officers. Yeah yeah yeah, then as soon as he wakes up-- He only stops when you kill him down here. Or like Gilmore. Oh, I can't even imagine Hotis disguised as Pike. Yeah. We have to re-alter ourselves before we go downstairs. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. I mark off 1,000 gold. Does that mean all of our heal-- our points are healed, or are we just-- Oh. Oh, that's the question I wanted to ask you did we know if here, night and day is the same? No, that wasn't in any of his books? Well, fingers crossed. Okay. Wow. I want to throw up. Why are we inspired by hearing you talk all that shit about Tary? I don't feel inspired. You know what? It's getting there. Next time, share the compliments, make all of us feel cool. So over this part. I don't know. Should we? Rest? I don't even know what time it is here. It could be like early morning and we could rest and then wake up in the middle of the night. But it could be a completely different time here! Oh, that was a burp. I forgot we were filming. (laughs) I feel like we should just fucking try to do something. Well, there's the owner downstairs, the creepy guy. Oh, Jesus. I follow. Wait! We're not altered! Oh god. Tary, can he heat up to the point that he doesn't work any more? You made him, after all. You would know. Tary? Can you Alter Self again, on us? If we're screwed, we might have to be us. But you'll be out of other things you can do? Oh god. Yes. You know, he might do great here. I haven't been doing so hot. Let's just send Grog down. Yeah, but everything I've tried hasn't worked so far. Maybe they're immune to persuasion down here and maybe all they need is a little (grunts) a little jostle. Let's just fucking go. We're going to be okay. He says he's got enough for everyone still. No, he can do it again to all of us. It's up to you, Percy, dear. With. With Grog. You're going with Grog. Have fun storming the castle. Did he really? Did you take soul? Come back, please. I smack both their asses. Yeah. Ugh. Oh. Yum. How'd it go? Like in here? Oh. God, it's good to be so cool. I've had none! This place is just so hot. Did you ask him if you don't look like a tiefling if people are going to notice? All right. All right. How would we do that? What if somebody threw a rock and hit us? We're quite innocent. Well, Tary is. (whispers) Don't say his name! Freddie. I wouldn't know that-- Oh my god, how wonderful would it be if Scanlan could just Dimension Door-- Oh, I shouldn't have said his name. Could just Dimension Door down to that thing, to the room, and just slice up the little egg, and then-- -- bamf out? Probably not. Probably. What is it? No Scanlan! (laughs) Well, he's not here-- Like, you walk through walls? God, I really wish we had the stones with us now. Yeah, but-- I mean, you could find your way down there. No, not an imp. It's an insect. You'll bamf into yourself. Oh, wow. I just don't think we should do that to Barry. I really don't feel like he is. Don't say our name. Don't whisper. Oh, dear lord. To killing an archdevil. TRAVIS and Could be, like, a pit fiend or something. It won't be easy! Let's be honest. This is going to suck! You're not going to have to sign anything, yeah? These are the least stealthy people I think I've ever seen, and we know Pike. He's quiet. He's really quiet. His boots are made of fur. They're very quiet. Yeah. Oh my god. Can you cast Locate Creature right now? Just cast it and see. Let's do it. Because it's a level fucking four. Oh. You're not a-- well, it doesn't matter. A tiefling anymore. She could be a succubus. Those are the golden armored things Was there anything else flying other than them? Oh, god. There's no window, it's just wall. She becomes leader of the Ashari and dies as soon as she gets to hell. Wait, are succubuses devils down here or are they demons? Okay. They're fiends. Ermahgerd. Oh god. Should we come out? Oh my gosh. Oh no! Shut up. (laughs) Things aren't going very well here. Hey, bonus!
