So good! Did you really draw that? I like it! Which one's which? (all laugh) Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Loot Crate! Merch update! There's merch still in the store! All that stuff. It's true. This is legit. No, it's not! Thanks, Matthew Mercer! (singsong) New Trinket stats! Yep, and a cannon. That Scanlan could've gotten. I'll run downstairs. Can't miss that. I start grabbing bacon from the big piles. It's perfect. Help yourself. Oh! Start guarding. Taryon, you don't have to worry about paying on this. I'm sure I have it written down somewhere. (all laugh) Yeah, there were books! There was also a dragon attack. Really not necessary. You should do it, Grog. I'm scouring my notes for where I wrote their salaries down. It was, but I've got my spiral here. That's my memory! 100 gold a month for each of the guards, and then what was the extra? And then we always gave Jarett a bonus because he was captain. Yeah, I remember. Do you know where the rest of the crew is, Shayne? Right. Well, we're glad to have you back. Do any of us remember why Nitebe went to Wildmount? Oh no! We did? Oh no, we killed our guard? Maybe he just took our money and ran? I doubt it, though. Maybe. Yeah, just scry while we're eating breakfast. What do you see? Has he posted anything on Facebook lately? What do your scrying eyes see, Keyleth? Oh no! This is actually very terrible. That's terrible. Well. At least we've avenged him, in a way. Yeah, I'll get right on that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anywho. We're down a few servants, we should probably get some more guards. Hey, Shayne, do you have anyone you'd recommend? That's all right. Find a few more? A lot of keeps have been ruined. Guards might be looking for work, actually. Good leading. Good leading, Keyleth. This is shitty. Can I roll for insight and make sure that she's trustworthy? I feel like she's trustworthy, but-- I rolled poorly for my insight-- 13? All right. I like it. Make sure they're trustworthy, if we're not going to be around. And I hand her 500 gold for herself and for Kendrick. And the three that you hire. She's cool. To drop off the evil book and do a little research on the Nine fucking Hells. She's got to get crowned. Even larger antlers? So you just hold it like a giant mantle? (gasps) You could turn into doors! A mimic! Yeah, we have! I think it's a no. Okay! What are we fucking doing? What are we doing? Oh, Grand Poobah. I'm afraid you have to wear something quite formal. I really thought we were going to get him to bathe this time. (laughs) Just a belt. A really glorious belt. Over the dwarven belt. Gross! Seriously, though, what are we doing? Maybe your dad will have information on the Nine Hells. Wait, I do have a question, actually. If you complete it, do they want you to stay? Or you stay and lead your people. It's just like getting married, Keyleth. It's all the planning. That just freaks you out, that's all. Theoretical, obviously! I do! (laughs) Keyleth! Make a decision. Leader. You're going to be a leader. Just make a choice. I'm looking forward to buying a dress either way. And see how you feel. Good plan. So wait. (valley girl voice) Would the shops here be better to buy a dress than the shops in Westruun? That's what I mean. But it's beautiful. You know what? Vasselheim will actually know a little bit about Orcus and I bet the Nine Hells, as well, being the god hub. We should go to Vasselheim! Decision's fucking made. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Are they regular, or are they greater? Oh. All right. That's pretty cool. Arcane magic. Make him look like he's just a big dude wearing a robe with a hood over his head. Let's just put a robe over him. Let him give it a go. I want to help him because I'm a rogue, too. What if we just put a stealth cloak over him or something? Yeah, then paint his-- yeah, I do. I start taking robes out. Grog's upstairs. Fine. I take all of the robes off. Do whatever you want. Why are we doing this? Just wear a robe! You need money to go buy a stupid mask for a stupid robot? No, it's not. No, it isn't. I have passed out money lately, before, I think. Fine! How about everybody gets a thousand gold. Yeah, everybody take a thousand gold. Except for you. (all laugh) I'm going go into town and buy some plates for Laina. Did he roll well? It's just a bunch of pieces of hair. How long does goop last? Will Doty just always have hair now? Gross. But it's going to be covered by a mask. Wow. (laughs) (laughs) Nice. (laughs) Are you sure? Oh my God. (all cheer) Chuck E. Cheese. #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage. (all laugh) What have you been doing up there? It's Dootie. Did you get glue all over my robe that I put on him? Oh, motherfucker. 24. Oh no! It's not ruined! That was my stealth robe. (laughs nervously) Yes. That's the only robe I fucking had! (shouts) I didn't know you were going to glue it to him! (shouts) I know! Motherfucker! Let's go to Vasselheim. Ew. I like it. Not the chest, but in the bag of holding. Wrapped in cloth. Waypoint. Well, we should go-- Yes, the library. We delivered the horn of Orcus to the Platinum Dragon. Yes. So we should probably go talk to them as well. And also to talk to them about Orcus. Since that's-- Yeah. Sure. Oh, Grog could also go learn about the Nine Hells! Yeah. Tary-- Tary! Tary-- I pull Tary aside. If you're going to go shopping with Grog you need to know-- don't look at him. He is terrible with money. Tary, he's terrible with money. I mean like, he will offer them-- stop it! He will offer them double what they ask for. I'm just saying-- (deadpan) I'm so happy for you. Just keep an eye on him, all right? (sighs) (strained) Fabulous. (laughs) No, you were going to the Platinum Sanctuary. We're going to the library. We are. We have come to discuss the (whispers) Horn of Orcus that we delivered here a while ago. Mm-hm. What? I don't remember. Oh. Right. As he does that, I look to Vax and go, hey, I have an idea. So the book we have, right? What if instead of leaving it here, we left it at the Raven Queen's sanctuary? Don't you think they would keep it more safe? Because she hates undead, right? This is like her nemesis, right? Oh, really? Do you want to do that? All right, cool. Let's forget I mentioned anything. All right. I just lean against Trinket. Do we know what we're going to say? Or hold it, right? Do something with it. Okay. It's history, though. True. Didn't mean to summon you, Scalebearer, I know your time is precious. We however came across, in fighting the Chroma Conclave and defeating them, this book which references Opash's search into necromancy. NecromANcy? NecrOmancy. Necrome-- yes. Necrom√©. Researchers. It's an evil tome. (whispers) All of it. Can I insight check him? (groans) It's not terrible, but it ain't good, 14. Necromancy. Yes. Right. Well, that's good. Okay. Yes. Be warned, the book tried to claim me. I know, yeah. Can I ask you, how much do you know of Orcus? I don't know much of anything, and it's important that we learn. He only has two horns, right? Four? And you don't have another one down in that vault? If you hear any word of that horn, will you send word to us? Of course. Thank you so much for your time. Do you know much about the Nine Hells? I fear we have to travel there. There is a rakshasa after my brother and our cleric friend, Pike. And, unfortunately, I fear he will return if we don't snuff him out at the source. Do you know what sort of people might survive there? All right. All right. So, we'll go to the Cobalt Reserve. Fabulous. Thank you. (whistles) Mm-hm. All right. What about? All right. Do you think if you go to the Raven Queen's temple, she'll claim you for her own right now? What am I seeing? (laughs) What the fuck is this? When did it happen? What do you mean, you don't know? Did it happen after you died? What the fuck? We have to get you to a cleric, that's not normal! Are you sure it's related to her? Well, they're holding the Horn of Orcus. Playing devil's advocate. Then let's go to the Raven Queen's temple. Do you want to go now? Let's go. Would I have known anything about what that thing was? Like trauma? It doesn't look like Raishan's? Wait, I thought we had the book. It's glued under the cloak. There was no box. It was a book wrapped in cloth in the bag of holding. I mean, if he really was a demon, why would he need to do research? Genealogy of the Nine Hells! Oh, you mean like Senokir? You said he was a demon and he was actually a devil. The succubus? What about the succubus? We did kill a succubus. Ooh, to a lesser? Like they get turned into something smaller? I thought you took the book. No, you have the book. I thought you were lying to the guy. You actually have the book, right? I didn't take the book, I thought you took the book. Are you fucking serious? Let's go to the library. We're heading to the library. Similar to James Spader. I think you have to use the second roll. Yes. Do you guys have the book? What the fuck? What did you find? All right. Okay. We can read that! Wonderful. The City of Dis? Okay. We have Grog's bag of holding, the same one we've always had. Hey, is there somewhere we could buy a fucking bag of holding? Is there somewhere I could find before things close? Just to see? Oh, balls. That's terrible. I rolled 13. Fuck! Fuck. Fine. It's fine. Keyleth? How about we go see your dad. They definitely are interested in it at the Platinum Sanctuary. They were very interested in researching it. Which I don't think is a bad thing. They're good people. And learning about history is a good way to keep yourself from repeating it. However, you do serve the Raven Queen, who I know wants nothing to do with the undead. And if it means destroying this book, then do what needs to be done. It was my idea! Go fuck yourself. Dresses? Oh, everything's fucking closed! Are there dress shops open? At all? We just want pretty dresses. Oh! Oh! Oh! 25. Ah! Everything's better! Keyleth? What's good for your Ashari people? Something covered in grass, maybe? Turf? Astro-turf? Lots of pink bows, maybe, for me. Right, and we could be like-- Help us. Make us pretty. And very expensive looking. It's my first time getting to dress up as royalty. This is terrible. Give her something flowy. In all the colors. Can it be in all the colors? Okay. She's had a few. I think that's acceptable. Mm-hm. I can't believe these dresses are so much cheaper than a healing potion. Ridiculous. (laughs) Wait, we're picking them up in the morning, Keyleth. You're not even wearing it yet. Oh, we haven't heard from them in a long time. Grog! Did you buy potions? I want to say the name of it. MARISHA and The other bar. (mystical voice) We're in the Siren's Succor. (mystical voice) Meet us soon. Did you buy potions? Beer! (laughs) Some wine. Ugh. (laughs) I'm staring at the door waiting for Grog and Taryon. Grog. I forgot how weird Doty looks. Did you get it? Did you finally get it? It's been all night. He killed them? Did he really kill them? Dear diary. I have an itty bitty metal penis. (all laugh) As he's doing this, I pull out some lipstick and I start drawing lipstick on his face, to try to turn him boy to girl. (laughs) Grog. (nervous sound) What? 20! This is what happens when Pike isn't around! Did anyone see you do it? Doty, did anyone see you do that to the guards? Maybe you shouldn't bring him into cities. Maybe that should just be a rule. Doty doesn't come into cities. Well, yeah, Trinket is well-behaved. Doty kills people. Yeah, can I try? Can I try too? Oh! (laughs) Did you buy potions? For me? Oh. (sighs) Do we need to go find these dead guys? Except for mistakes. Don't kill people in cities! Don't kill people! Don't kill people! Grog! Did you-- You didn't kill anyone, did you? I don't believe him. Can I roll an insight check? Oh no. Oh no! LAURA and I believe him! I believe him so good! 11! Oh my God! Grog! Ugh, we're never going to be able to come back to Vasselheim! I don't believe you. Yeah, I don't believe you. You killed them. Oh, I rolled Gil, too! I got it. I got you covered. 24! You fucking dick! No, but seriously, you still attacked the guards, right? That's still really bad. At least Doty was in disguise. No one will recognize him. Just take the disguise off him now. Take the disguise off of him. A robit? It's necromancy. Yes. (gasps) What? We thought we had a book. But we didn't. Did you? I say we get Doty's disguise off of him. I say we go to sleep. Then we get up in the morning, and we pick up our pretty dresses. And we go get you crowned! So we can wear our pretty dresses. What about the cloak? No! Why were they going to arrest you? It's not illegal! We totally should. How about you go first, Tary. Hey! Wow. Oh. Chicken. That's amazing. So worth it, darling, I can't believe you did that. Thank you. It's got clumps of red hair stuck. Probably. Yeah. Okay, let's rent a room. For everyone. We've got it. It's fine, Tary. We should go to see your people. No. We should go to see. Your. People. Wait, what are the colors of Whitestone again? That's the colors I want my dress to be. We need to work on that, Percival. You also need to explain to me what the fucking Grey Hunt is at some point. Come on, let's go, Keyleth. Antlers upon antlers. Is it super windy? So what do we do? While she was walking, I go behind and do this to Vax. Does it still hurt? Yeah? All right, that's happy. (growls) I've never seen Grog eat a single vegetable-- -- the entire time I've known him. He doesn't know. (gasps) Kind of like gnomes. Sure. Oh, man. With the tree, man. No more of Dis City. Well, I'm glad we went with the blue dress after that cape turned all the other colors of nature and it's like, you are covered.
