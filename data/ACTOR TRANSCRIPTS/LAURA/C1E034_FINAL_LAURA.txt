What's up, buddies? That's right. (gasps) Hey Ashley! Oh my gosh, that's so cool! Oh, thank you! No, I didn't win. They were unveiling my character in Uncharted tonight. I didn't, no. I just sat there and then I went, "Okay, well, I've got to go!" And I got up and ran and I feel like an idiot. Briorities. That's my thing! Oh, there's no drink in my-- What is happening? (laughs) Just one? It's just a ring finger but it's still a goliath. Huh? That's me, yes, what? I have no sunbeam arrow, but I would like to dip some arrows in some holy oil at this moment in time. I do have potentially an exploding holy arrow. No, this is a normal one, and then I have a question mark, as well. Fuck yes, I do. Yes. Well, no. Each thing takes three arrows, so I can do six arrows altogether. Are we going to get there? I want to do it right before we walk in the room, Matt. Don't do anything. Look. Don't touch. Is there something different? And then wait. Of course he would. Oh, we did! We can't sleep in this-- So we split them up? What if we used Seeming and made one of us seem like Lady Briarwood? Yes? (whispers) Can I insight check her? (whispers) 21. And upward. Should I stealth with you? Hey! I get advantage because of the gold dress. 23. Him first. Yes, Trinket stays. Trinket follows Percy. He's following Percy. Pike! Except for you, darling. That is awkward. He likes it. The actual Cassandra. Well. Shall we? Shall we keep moving? Pike always ruins stealth. (laughter) Ooh, mood lighting. Check for traps. Yeah, perception. Oh yeah, I should do it too. Hold on. Yeah, I know, right? 18 for me. How about wait a fucking second and let me look for footprints? Can I look for footprints? Okay. I don't know which one to use. I'm so nervous. Okay, let's do this one. That was a bad one. I'm perceptioning? Oh. Well, it's the same. That is a 16. That's where the acid pits are. Acid. Briarwoods. Briarwoods? He fucking understands signs. He listens to you. They got the message. 21. Again. Oh no! Yeah it smells like Grog, so avoid it. Okay, that's not good. Eight? Nope! Yeah. (nervous laugh) Yeah-- Just regular? Seven. And Trinket ate it, too! We're immune to poison? (gasps) That's amazing! He just grows a beard. You have advantage on charisma? You have advantage on persuasion checks. That's awesome. Oh, where did Pike go? God damn doors. Inspect it for traps! Can you pick it? Oh, that's good, that's better than mine, but not much. 23? Can I do an arcana check, or something, to see if it's magic? Go. Tell us what's up. I'm stepping a little back. Do you know what's on the other side? A conductor? That's a beautiful thing. It's a conductor room. How high are the ceilings? Should I try to shoot it? When none of us are in the room? That's true. So, can we clear out and I'll try to shoot it? Okay. I'll do that. Do I add my attack to it? 27. It did nothing! The Arkenstone! Definitely. (laughter) Can you disarm it? Maybe just try to get through the room. Some of us stay on one side, some other people go through and see what happens to the first person. And just go through the other door? He's right there! Just fucking talk to him. Do it. I touch another one. Touch one of the stones, Grog. Trinket. This is totally going to work. Do we see any missing ones? 21. Nice! Is she on the other side of it? Is the door opening behind her? Goddamn it. I dip my arrows in holy oil. Three of them. We're all in the glass. Just do it. Do it. You said you wanted to do it, just do it. Oh, is this your room? I didn't even realize we were in your house right now. How good to see you again, darling. Oh my god, we're going to die. I drink my Potion of Flying that I took from Ripley. That's why the Thunderwave hit us all, because we're all in one giant room together. Do it! We're backing up to where we're not in the middle of the acid. Preparing what? Okay. Can I Hunter's Mark them? I'm going to attempt to. Yeah, figured as much. Oh god! I shoot my exploding arrow at the glass. It's an exploding arrow. It's something, it's something. I was going to shoot the exploding arrow at the glass door. I did, and it was 22. Oh shit, that would've been so good to have on them. I'm sorry. I know. 43. Grog! This is on the side that they left through. The door closed again? Does the acid go through glass? Can I take one of my glass vials that I have and try to get some acid and put it up on the ceiling? I'm flying. I took a flying potion to get out of the acid. Am I high enough that I can see where the pipes are coming in at? So I could potentially grab hold of one of the pipes on the ceiling and try to move it? I want to try to grab hold of one of those pipes and aim it toward the ceiling, if I can move it. I'm the weakest! Do I get advantage? Damn it. Get those Boots of Levitation. Get them on! Fly up, because I just rolled a fucking zero. Literally a zero. Can I use my dagger that I have? The pipe? Can I try to lift it? I wrap my hands in cloth, and then I do it. Yeah. Potentially, but we destroyed them. Can you Dimension Door? Take Pike. But he's Percy-sized right now. Oh, right. Do it! Just try it. Go. Okay. That's way better! 13? Yeah, at the ceiling. I keep doing it. And I fly over to the other side and do the same thing. I'll keep directing it. Shitballs. We're going to die. (laughs) I rolled a zero! Break the outside gem! Maybe you could hit it with a mace, Pike. 4d6. I'm trying really hard to lift this pipe with my scrawny little arms. Oh no. 12 for strength. Okay. Oh! We have another gem. Hit it! Yeah, that's a lot of energy. Hit it with your staff! Does it look like a big enough tunnel now that I can move the pipe? And a bear? Dimension Door out, again! Yeah. Nine. I kick it with my foot to move it out of the way. I'm like Chun Lee, my legs are so strong. Go on the other side so you can open up the door that leads out. Oh, yeah! You're made of jelly. Can you do it? That's awesome. Okay. This is the best. Oh, four. It's made of metal, guys. That's what he pushed. Push it! Unless it's still blocking the way because the door won't open, so we have to go up and over the fucking door. So that's what we have to do. The glass door that is partially destroyed that won't lower. We jammed the door. It won't open. So. There's a tunnel; we can go up and over. I use the earring and I go, Vax! Vax, please! That acid is filling the room! We're all dying. I don't know what to do. Yeah. Up and over, let's go. I have the robe of infinite rope-ness. I'm flying. I tie him and then Grog lifts him like a pulley. I'm flying so I get underneath him and try and wedge him, help him get into the hole. Oh my god. I thought-- Oh my god. Percival? Can we stealth? I think we should, because as far as they know, we're dead now. They don't know we got out of there. Yeah, I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us. Wait, can't you roll again now that I told you we were casting-- Doesn't work that way? Nice. 35. Can I take some of it and rub it on some of my arrows? I'm scared of all of my dice right now. 18. I'm damaged a little. I don't know how long I want to wait when Vax is-- To sacrifice him. That Vasselheim accent is rubbing off on you, Pike. I think save your spells, Pike. I don't know. Stealth as much as we can and then take them out? I don't know. How high up can I fly? Is it all dark up? I keep raising up. I want to keep raising up so I can get a better view of what's happening. Are Sarenrae and Pelor good buddies? Would you know? Or should we get on each side? 200 feet square? One on each side? Percy, what do you think? MARISHA and Can I see? I raised up. Vax will hear me if I whisper down to everybody. (whispering) Vax. Vax! (whispering) I don't know where we are. Acid everywhere. Vax, please. Isn't there anything you can do? (whispering) I would love to, but I don't know where you are. (whispering) Please, Vax. Please. Isn't he supposed to not be able to get charmed? I'm stalling so that everyone can walk around. Oh, he's not here! Wait. I'm flying up. Trinket's going-- Sure. Vax looks like Percy right now! They know we're up to something. Send in the real Percy? I'm floating above, keeping an eye. (laughing) Oh no, this is so stupid. And I'm sneaking into the dark as much as I can, but I want to raise up and be where I can be above them and shoot down. This is so brilliant. Oh god. Can I see? I'm raised above, right? I'm going to stay hidden as my-- oh, god-- and I'm going to dip the rest of my arrows in holy oil. I float closer in the darkness. Up. Up. I don't have something planned. I'm just going to go. I let go of my arrow and cast Conjure Barrage with a holy arrow at them. Yeah, I know they're all there, and it shoots a cone of arrows at them. It's holy arrows. All of them will be holy arrows, because Conjure Barrage uses whatever kind of ammunition I have shot. Oh, that's a good question. Conjure Barrage is-- dexterity save. There's a whole lot of arrows flying at you, just letting you know. 3d8, plus whatever the holy would be? Okay, for each? Okay. Oh, that's it? I just do that? 3d8, that's it? Nine. Not including the d4. Two. This is a problem. 11. 11. We're going to die. All my dice. Every dice! I don't have any dice left to roll. You still look like Percy. I wanted to use my bonus action to hide. 29. She helped him. Lightning Bolt? She's immune. Yeah, you were there for that fight. It was a long time ago. Silence her would be good, too. Fall over. And then? Chain! Yeah, that's not a good thing. Maybe it's better to-- So you can hide behind it after you cast it. Me? I'm going to shoot my storm arrow. I'm going to shoot from my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. At Lord Briarwood. At Sylas. Okay. Well, Percy. That one didn't work. That's a natural one for the first. That's three arrows, though. The second one's good, that's a 25. And the last one is a 29. Okay, so that is an extra 1d6 lightning damage for every attack. 15 for the first one, and then... 15 for the second one. And that was -- Oh no. Yeah, that's it. And that's the first attack. The second attack is another shot. With a holy arrow. At him again. Okay, so 25. Okay. 15, for the last hit, too. I use my bonus action to hide again. I want to hide. Natural 20. (cheering) Oh! Sneak Attack damage. She's a rogue! I like it. Now I can see. Oh, shit! Don't say you sold your soul to a hag. That's a Sneak Attack. But this is the same as a sneak attack. Is she blinded? But he's pretty close to dying. What about-- oh, sorry. Yeah! Like a radiant blast or something? I know. I am going to cast-- nobody's in a clump anymore! They keep moving around! I'm going to attack Lady Briarwood with just two attacks. Trinket's going to run next to Vax. Okay. And then I'm going to shoot her a couple times. Natural 20. Yeah, the first one was a 23. Natural 20 again! 17 for the first one. And then what do I do, just double the second? 19 for the second. Hide! Instead of backing up, can I go sideways? Okay. Can I go below where the steps are to hide? Behind the wall? Okay, then I want to stay high. And I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Hunter's Mark on her. Oh man! I should have done that at the beginning, but I thought I was going to hide again. What a waste. She's trying! She's trying to fight it! If only Scanlan had inspired you. Well, I thought Trinket would be able to help you, but you're not doing anything. Just set it up. You could do it on this move. Then on the next move-- (quietly) Can you inspire Vax? Pretty close. Kill him! I love you, too. Your headset looks really pretty! Awesome, I'm going to shoot him. Yeah, with holy arrows. That does not hit him. Come on. 19? 17, plus two holy damage. Yeah. Yeah. 19. I'm afraid my flying potion's going to start to wear off soon, so I'm going to move. Is there a roof? On that middle compound building? Oh, really? Can I land on top of the pillar? Yeah! But I can still see-- Yeah, okay. So he can go heal himself unless we can get him. Like a ketchup packet! Violent shot? Get out of her view? A greater? We wasted a greater?! He's a mist. (laughing) That was the lamest thing. That was way cooler than what you said. How does it feel, Lady Briarwood? What about yours? The lady. Trip her! Seriously? She's Hunter's Marked! Is he under the thing, still? Or did it break? I float down in front of him and slap him across the face. Oh god. You can handcuff her behind her back. Yeah. Maybe Greater Restoration her. Oh. Sorry, Cassandra. That's going to suck. Can I see, from being on the roof, what's inside the building? You said there's no roof to that temple I was up on top of. She's inside the temple. Can I drop the rope down from the roof where I'm at, so everybody can get up in? Okay. I'm going to do that. I don't know if you want to try the doors, but I just thought we could get in. I lowered the rope so you guys can start climbing up. Ugh. Can I shoot at her? I want to. Okay. I don't see it. It doesn't say on the-- You can't throw 80 feet. No, you can't. We're on the roof around it. I feel like it's 120 feet. Oh, I do? That's great, then 13. Can I hit her again? It's a Bigby Hand! 20 was the second arrow that I shot at her. Can I maybe go through the piece of paper that she's reading? 19 damage to her is what I rolled. Do we get advantage on it at all? 16. Another 18 points of fire damage? Oh, okay. Oh no. Have I recovered at all to shoot again? Have I recovered enough to shoot at her again? I know. Bad News. Are you up on top? I can't give it to you. Can I take a potion really fast? What are we trying to do? I'm going to guzzle a potion, and then I'm going to shoot Percy's special arrow, question mark? At the orb. Then what am I supposed to do? Killing her, what good will it do? Maybe she's a sacrifice, at this point. I had said I was going to shoot the orb. All right. I'm going to shoot the special arrow, question mark. Yeah, exactly. 23? I don't know what I'm doing! 15? Oh shit. No. 15. Should I have shot her? I'm sorry. I should have shot her! Can I still fly? I'm going to pull out a fancy robe from my bag and I'm going to try to fly towards the orb. Misfire? Oh, wait! I took a potion. I took a potion! I said it on the last turn, and I didn't use it. I don't know how much to roll for a greater healing potion. That's why I didn't do it. (whispering) I'm going to die. No, I'm serious. I'm going to die right now. Okay. 76. I know that. 11. Wait, 13. Am I close to it? Can I roll for acrobatics? Maybe I can catch myself. Okay. I don't know where a d20 is. Acrobatics? LIAM and And I'm unconscious. That's my first time I've ever been unconscious. No. I took out a fancy robe. I was going to trap the globe. All right. You can kill her! Do it with as little blood as possible. I'm dead. I'm unconscious. You're not going to try to heal me? You're not going to heal me? Trinket's at the door going, (sad bear noises). Get me out of here! Oh no. It might work on the roof. (laughing) Oh my god, I'm going to die. Oh god! Okay. Save. I've only failed one. Three times. Grog, you smell terrible. (chuckles weakly) No. Can you put it in a vial? Oh god. Don't touch the orb. You want to put the two bad things together? No. Two negatives make a positive? Yeah. I can walk. That's so far away. Might as well try it. Do we have any acid? You have acid, can we pour it? What? I'm laying on top of Lady Briarwood right now. Great. Magic. It kills all magic! Can you try pouring acid on the thingy? And I rolled a one right as that final. I can't believe I almost died again from that damn death ray! If I hadn't taken that potion right before I leapt off-- A bunch of wasted healing potions. Long.
