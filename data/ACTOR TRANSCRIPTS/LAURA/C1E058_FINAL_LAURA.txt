How - you were already here! Oh, that’s how it works. There are so many good pieces. We choose the top three, right? And then the Critters get to - Yeah, I don’t understand how that’s working, because we’re choosing the top three, and then the Critters get to choose between the ones that we choose. I understand. And disregard it completely. Ooh, it’s beautiful! All of it, all of it goes to the charity. (gasps) You haven’t done it yet? We’re just going to hula-hoop for three hours. They’re going to do other things. I’m going to hula-hoop for three hours straight. No no no! Keep stalling! Remember, he was in his pajamas and Gilmore was like, "put this on, I made this for you." Well, say it, he might roll less. Isn't it a roll against a roll? To wake us up? 26. Everybody? (southern drawl) 11. Nice. Oh, god. This is so much worse than I thought it was. How do we know what our AC is? Here take it, I'm sorry. (happy grunting noise) EVERYONE BUT MATT AND No no no. I thought the gunman was in the hallway? Percy's gunman was in the hallway. Oh, shit! Golf clap. He came in. Really hoping. But we didn’t get to go. (biting noise) Oh, shit. That’s good, that’s good. Okay. I’m going to get up, I’m going to yell at Trinket to run out the door, and I’m going to grab my arrows and my quiver and my broom. Can he get to the guy? Okay. The broom. And I take off running to the west tower. So we don’t see the guy outside of Percy’s room? Take out your hand? One more. Yeah, which ones are everybody’s rooms? Okay. Hell yeah, she is. Oh, no! She took 24 twice! Oh, Pike! Yeah, I’m not going to need it. Percy tastes blood. No more! No. No. Oh my god! Yeah, I know, is that good or bad? Both? Oh, thank god. Okay. Well, you won’t be able to move once she goes. You won’t be able to do an action because you’re trapping yourself. Awesome. He’s got his normal clothes on. We’re all naked. There’s another guy? This is all happening so fast! Me? Okay, the wall just opened up, so I’m going to shout for Trinket to run after the assassin throwing the knives. And I’m going to run out the doorway. If I go up on my broom, will I be able to see them down in the courtyard? I mean, if I run out the door - right, right. Well, if I’m in the air, can I see down at... (singing) You’ll be great. I want to shoot the rakshasa! (all laugh) Yes! I’m going to use my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. Okay. I make an attack roll for three arrows. Okay, that’s a good one. That is 31. Yes. As the first hit. And 22 is the third. No, I’m neutral. Chaotic neutral. Why?! Does that mean I do not as good damage to him or something? God darn it. Okay, wait. Hold on. I’m just going to roll the first attack, because I’m stupid. Great. 12 for the first because I forgot to Hunter’s Mark him because I’m a genius because I’m just so worked up because my brother’s in trouble. Gosh darn it. 9 for the second attack. Oh, I haven’t been adding for the bracers. Add 4 extra to what I told you. 18 for the last. No, 20 for the last. I’m sorry, Matt. I’m freaking out. Natural 20. The second one I already rolled. It's a 25 for the second. (fake-cries) 21 for the last. Okay, do I have to roll... oh no, do I have to roll again for - Wait, I get another attack. Yeah. My second one - can I use my bonus action? Sorry. Not in between my two attacks? Hunter’s Mark! Oh, that’s right. He’s a rakshasa. He’s an asshole. I don’t know why. No, I don’t know why, but - - he didn’t seem to be affected. 19 for the last, with disadvantage. Okay. Okay okay okay. Oh, no, I don’t get any additional - - so that’s just 14. Because I don’t get any storm damage. Oh, but - No, I didn’t say that was true. Trinket instinctually ducks. Yeah. Midnight snack! He does the paw thing. He is so good at it. No! I shot him, though. What are you - what’s happening? Oh. Verks Merkernerk. Vox Joey. Is it a charm? Okay okay okay! Sheesh! Okay. And what is it, wisdom? 18 plus 3 is 21? I don’t know what he is. Oh, no! I know, I know. (whispers) Rakasha! (laughs) No boots. Mmm, that’s good. I’m going to grapple that dick so good. Grapple him, yeah! (all laugh) Okay, I’m going to... jeez, Louise. I’m going to... fly down and land on the ground as my move. And I’m going to shoot him with my Blazing Bowstring. 22! All right. (mumbling) ...13… (mumbling) ...plus 8… Is 21! On the first attack. And I get to use the Blazing Bowstring again because I get it twice. That is a 26. 15 on the second. Ah! Shit, add 4 to that. I’m sorry. I’m an asshole. And I yell, "What’s a hotis?!" Oh no. Oh no! I can hear music, it’s just really quiet! Damn. 18. 22, 28, 29. Ooh! Oh my god! Pikey-Pike killed a rakshasa! What the fuck was that? What was that? What is this? Trinket is slowly realizing nobody’s around him. Who, Hotis? Right. And then you walked away. Good job, guys! Totally on it. I fly up on the broom and try to spot anybody on the ground that looks dangerous. (laughs) I thought it was silver. Matt said it was silver the last game. Do I see anything? Can I land? Wait, did you say me or him? He’s actually quite light. Ow, no, I'm serious. Don't! I'm really not strong. Come on. You know what? At least it doesn’t smell as bad as your feathers. I’ve got it. Potentially. Hey! Get that shit off. Somebody give him something to put on. Grog, do you have any more fancy robes? Well, just cover up your bits with it, maybe. I don’t have any dangly bits, I’m sorry to tell you. A couple other things. Give him a fancy robe, Grog. Grog! For my sake? Oh, shit. Wait. Why are you keeping it, Percy? All right. No. Oh. That's right, that's where your gun went. Nothing? Does that mean we should take it back in and chop it up so nobody ever puts it on? Yeah, look in it. No, no, it's a fancy robe. It's just a regular robe. I take off run - oh, she's by herself. Yeah. I pull out my weapons. (laughs) (singing) And naked! (laughs) Do you remember? A little floating cloud of - A little smoky tutu? He let it go. He wanted to walk naked. Zahra. Kashaw. You say "dot dot dot"? (laughs) He fought the rakshasa to begin with. We're grabbing a drink, Kashaw. Cassandra? I want to put on my armor. And then go find Zahra. Yes. Kima? Is she all right? Good work. They're just tigers. Do tigers - A hotis. A hotis? So still him and you? How long will that take? (scoffs) Yeah, good luck. How do you know that? Okay, dinner? Okay. I know. Right next to the dragons? (sighs) Sheesh. Who is his boss or something? Within The Clasp. Who does he report to in The Clasp? (whispering) Within The Clasp. I have one job on this ship. Spireling Veekar. Wait, 4 dead bodies? Wait - Plus Kima's. Did you kill one or two? (laughs) Good save. A Robe of Flaying?! Gross. In the Bag of Holding? Don't play with it, Grog. Just don't put it on because you think it will be fun. Percy? Are your guards very well-trained in tracking? Trinket has their scent. I mean, I can send him to help. What are you pointing at? Your boob? Other than the fact that it smells really bad? Wait, so you could have flown when you came out of the dragon? (gasps) Oh, shit. What the fuck? (frustrated) It's so ridiculous. (frustrated noise) I walk up and I - You flying fuck. You flying fuck! (angry noise) I mean, congratulations, it's really cool! If I didn't fall off of it. You have fucking wings! Jesus. I walk away. (angry groan) Really? All right. I love you, too. I'm glad you're not dead. Oh. I'm glad I didn't push you off the cliff! I almost did. Wow, good to know. No, I'm less, aren't I? Oh, shit! Shit. Tracking the guy. I could. We know he's going back to Stillben. Fully armored. Can I go knock on his door in the morning? Brother? Sorry. I don't mean to disturb you. I just feel really guilty. I just wanted to say sorry for being mad at you for being able to fly, because I'm actually really impressed and proud of you, and I'm glad you're not dead. What the fuck is wrong with you? You smell better. I mean, yeah, she's not in the castle, but I can find - Yeah, no fucking - This is true. Oh. Hi, dear. Oh, yes - No, no, everything's great. Is Allura in here, as well? I would love some. Hi! Thank you. Of course it is. Prestidigitation. (all laugh) I look at Kima. How the fuck does she do it? Right? Oh! I forgot. I came here for a reason. My brother is shaken up from last night, and I think he might be a little worried about - I don't know, he sent me to find you. I'm not exactly sure what's going on, but he looked terrible, and he thought maybe you would be able to help? I'm going to catch up. You get a head start. I'm just going to get some more coffee. I know you do, darling. I know you do. I don't know. Is he still in the toilet or did he get out yet? Okay. Are you cursed? Is he cursed? My brother, puking his guts out. Ah! He was cursed. Grog, can I have your jug for a moment? I just want to get some water. Regular-ass water. Not ass-water. Just regular water. No, no. Just regular water, Grog. Drink this. Yeah. You're very dehydrated, seriously. Percival! Percival, stop. He was cursed. Oh! Or Bloody Marys? Ask for Bloody Marys. Bloody Marys. Does it not work anymore? Ask for mayonnaise. Aw. Please. Good job! Oh, that's probably bad for you right now, but that's all right. Yeah. It's a guy? Good job! Fuck, yeah. I want to check the body to see if I can find anything useful. There was a lot going on. Whoa. And you said 300 gold? A what-sized glass sphere? Oh, it's the Raven Queen. Her champion. Can I check out the sphere that I'm looking at? I shake it. Oh, shit! I made something happen. Allura, do you know what this is? (gasps) A Scrying Eye? This fist-sized glass sphere - You can scry... Oh, you can scry for anything. It actually is really perfect. I really, really like this thing. We can give her one of the stones. (laughs) Yeah, should you need us. That's true. Yeah. (cackles) The Feywild. And we can just pop on in there because of you, Keyleth. Oh. Sure. Yeah. Let's find it. You just have a Trapper-Keeper full of appointments? (laughs) (unhappy noise) Oh, oh. It’s all going so fast. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’m just so proud. I just really wanted to hug you, too. Yeah. You might. Can I just - One quick question - I don't want to bother you because I know there's a lot going on, but we're going into the Feywild. And... I'm really nervous about this broom. Yeah? (gasps) You were? Okay. Okay. Well, all right, but - Don't lose sleep over it. Unless you really want to. But I don't want to force you into anything. Thank you, dear. (quietly) Come on, come on. Me? Hey, what's going on? I very much remember that, Scanlan. I owe you so much. Oh, no. This pointy motherfucker? How's it look? Well, there you go. (all laugh) Does this mean we're even? This hat makes us even? (cackles) I fucking like it. I appreciate it. Yeah. I would try it out, but I don't have the broom on me right now, so. I turn the hat at an angle and make it look a little more dashing. I like it. I hand him his drink as soon as he comes in. (excited shout) Percy, you've outdone yourself. I just sit on it, raise up a little, take my hands off the broom - Oh, god. Do I have to roll disadvantage? Ha ha! That's right, and it's a 30! (excited cheers) I'm sorry, sir. No, it's all right. I fly up and I grab it off the wall and I bring it back down. You burned it. Thank you. Sorry it's burned now, but there you go. Yes. Charred. It's nice and charred. MAN WITH I land next to my brother. You wanted to talk to me. Why? Oh, well fuck it. I get up and start flying again. I float down behind him - - and give him bunny ears behind his head. Gulp, gulp, glub, glub, glub. (loudly) Oooh! I mean, go for her... Say nothing. I won't say anything. I'm just going to keep flying around. (whispering) Was it lacy panties? I float down and kick Grog in the head and then float back up. Big tavern brawl! Trinket! No, no! You're such an asshole. I go take a shower. (all laugh) I run up behind Pike out of my shower and I twirl her around and I give you a big old hug and a kiss on the cheek. We'll be back soon, darling. Take care of everything. I ought to get dressed. Bye, Lord Pike. (laughs) Totally fine, dear. Are you building another shop? Of course. We'll keep promoting you, then. (laughs) Okay. Well. Oh, god. It's happening. Oh, it's really - Oh, Pike's not here. Hum - oh, yes. My pretty! (cackles) Oh, it's happening? It's happening. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I thought we already - It sounds beautiful. Oh, man, that's right. Yeah, we'll do something. Oh, no... They made her the most amazing quilt! And it's got art. It's so amazing. I'm pretty awesome. Yeah, it's true. So it'll be faster. No, no, no, you have the stone. You'll be really there. (singing) Pike in a box, baaabe. (singing peters out)
