No way! #AskTalksMachina. Oh, this is so exciting! All right, so these fabulous bracelets and those pins that you guys ordered a while ago? Those are shipping out next week, you guys, so look forward to that! You remember the limited edition patches that we had from Comic Con? We got more of those! So those are back in the store tonight, as well as if you go there right now, you may notice we have a limited run of more Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirts, as well as some How Do You Want To Do This t-shirts, and I know those are probably going to sell out pretty fast, but they will be back in the store in a couple of weeks, so if you order now, you might get them before Christmas in a couple weeks. I don't know, but we're doing our best. That unicorn, though. And these ones, these ones are in stock, so they're not pre-order. You had a song for me, I saw it! It'll be good. It'll be at a restart, when we all die. This set is amazing. In front of him?! They were in front of him? Yeah, but I thought you were holding out the chain and they were standing behind you. I looked for them the last game, and they're not around right now. 24. I rolled for Pike, too. Is that right? She's going to kill me. But you know what? That'll give her more time to get into the game. I'm the top? Oh Jesus. Oh my god. Okay. Number one, I'm going to yell at the boys to run back into the mansion. (nervous laughter) I hadn't thought this much yet because I didn't know I was going to be first. I'm going to-- Homina, homina. I'm going to Hunter's Mark. The pit fiend. And I have a question. If I do the Bramble Shot, does it do the damage straight up, and then if they do the strength save then it doesn't-- Okay. So I'm going to tell Trinket to move up next to him. Yeah, and can I do Bramble Shot as one of my attacks and then do another regular attack? Is that the way it works? It just says Bramble Shot. Okay, I'm going to try to do the Bramble Shot on it. Okay, that doesn't work. A one. Two ones. I don't know. The dice jail was in the thing; it's not here! Cool. This is off to a really awesome start. I'm going to just try to shoot him. 25? Does that hit him? Okay, good. 14, 16, 17, 18, plus 2d6 because Trinket's standing next to him. 25. Yes. I want to back up into the alley. Can I hide behind that building right there? In that little crevice? Okay. How many feet away am I from them? From Trinket. Thank you. My shitty turn! Good job. Great. Best place to be right now. I was like (heavy breathing). You're too scary right now, Matt Yeah. Don't intentionally look scary. Come on, Grog. Can you do that on a reaction? Why? Fuck. Do you have time to move? Trinket rolled 21. Is that a bite? Is it a bite attack or claw attack? Do I get to choose? It's a bite attack. It's 13. To piercing damage? To bear damage? What? It must be piercing. No. I meant in the mansion! I said yes. I meant in the mansion, stupid. Yay! Oh. Okay. I'm controlling Pike right now. Okay. So she's looking through the door. What can she see? Okay. Okay, she's going to step out of the door, and she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon. At fourth level. If she makes it an anvil, can she knock him down to the ground? I want to make it barbed noose to go around his neck. It's a yellow noose, so it looks spiritual. 23? 26 points. And is that all the bonus? Okay, cool. Oh, okay. Is Beacon of Hope-- oh, it's third level. Shit balls. "Oh, okay! Oh, hold on!" Okay, but nobody's hurt just yet. Spell bolsters allies with toughness and resolve. Oh, did she? What did she say? Oh, good! I want to do that! Radius blast, but that's not a second level or lower. Oh god, okay, fine! I'll do Aid, I guess. Why not? Okay, that's going to be huge. So the only people that are in range are Trinket, Grog, and me. So Grog, Pike, and Scanlan. You don't need it, though. Do you need it? I'm going to go Trinket-- Okay, Trinket, Scanlan, and Pike. And then Pike's going to run back in the door. Okay. Oh, okay! Plus five, what is that? 23. Thank god! Okay, good! Okay, I've already tried the Bramble Shot. It's gone now. Then I'm going to attack him a couple times. That was a one and a 30. The jail is full! I'm out of dice. I have to go through my bag again. 21. And then I'm going to move into the mansion. No! Yes, I'm going to move into the mansion. No! Okay. Yeah, I'm going to move into the mansion. What? He's whispering at me. Trinket licks Grog. Ashley, I'm texting you right now to tell you what you did! You look so pretty! Just come back the other way! Come back toward us! It's different. He's big! He could have a whip! So many books tonight. His boots? I love these things. Right? They're so fancy. It's a concentration. Your little, itty-bitty head. Even on a crit? But it's at disadvantage because of Hex. Oh no! His figure just died! If you fall unconscious, try to fall unconscious the other direction, okay? He's still got movement left. (gasps) Ooh, what a dick! You want to put that in my jail? Poisonless? God, is she flying really far away? Can Bigby pick you up? Yes, we can. But you can't move after, you can only do your action. Oh wait, don't forget, Ashley, you have the Spiritual Weapon up as a bonus action! I come out of the mansion. I want to fly out of the mansion on my broom. I don't know! I fly up in the air and see-- My goal was just to come out, spin around, and attack, but I don't see anything. So I want to be about there. Okay, I don't want to actually be that close to Scanlan, though, for the actual-- Yeah. I want to shoot a couple of arrows at the pit fiend. Is he under cover? Can I be any closer so I wouldn't have that? Okay. No, that's what he said. It's my full movement just to see him. Yeah. I have four ones that are, right now, in jail. Second attack is a 29. Great, cool, tight, awesome! 20. And then, for Trinket's action, can he run up after Grog on the roof? Can he try to scramble up? He rolled really low. What is that, just strength? So he rolled five. Wow, I've got to get some more 20s out here. I feel like you could make it to the top edge. She probably can't do it again. Is that her name? It's definitely Gamora. Remember, I'm not directly next to him. That's why I said I wasn't. Sure. Just try it, man. Just try it. That is actually going to help you, dude. Jesus, we're all going to die. That's going to be better for him, though, than getting these hits. Instead of shared, great. Yay. Of course. You better use Cutting Words on him, for one of these things. Tight. Cool, that is a four. Okay. I've got to get my calculator out to find out if I'm about to die. Yeah, no, that one doesn't hit, but the rest of them do. Okay, yeah, cool, tight. Oh, I thought that's what I just did? He got four attacks, right? Right? That was already the 18? Or was it? Oh, jesus. Okay. Cool, I'm unconscious. No, it's attached to me. It is attached. Right next to Pike! Does that mean that's an automatic death save failure, though? Oh, off of the stonework, not off of my body. I was like, just like that, huh? Don't forget, Scanlan, you've been getting five extra hit points at the start of your turn. Oh, it's just the hit point max, okay. Yeah, Pike cast Aid. That was amazing. Hey, thanks, man! Now me and Keyleth have the same amount of hit points! Can you try the sphere again? No, not even close. But she is! She's looking a little torn up. Yeah. Oh my god, this is a serious thing, though. You're going to get healed. Just wave it around, like, woo. Okay. I get up. Oh, then I'm going to cast Protection from Poison on myself. Wow, as my action. Well, what are you going to do? That cancels out the poison. Then I want to, as my bonus action-- Of course I did. As my bonus action, I'm going to take-- I don't know. I have a bag of gems of my own. I'm going to pull out from my thing, and toss it at the efreet, and say, we're more than we look, and we need your help. Hope that it bribes him. Persuasion, persuasion. 21. I'm going to move-- Is it stupid to move into the mansion? I'm going to move into the mansion. Trinket's going to run and stand next to Pike, to protect her. Oh no, why is he looking at something? Because we need that Dawnmartyr! I mean, it was so lovely the last time. Because it's that many dice? Yeah, it didn't, but this is different than the lava we've been in before? Loot Crate! He's really enjoying himself. TPK tonight, guys. She's poisoned! Unconscious. But if you move her, you'll get an attack of opportunity on her. God, that Heroes' Feast, man. That would've been clutch. No, just roll a d20. We've got to heal her! I do, I have the poison spell-- Okay, I'm first out. So, yeah, but I can run out. No, he can't move her! He'll get an attack of opportunity on Pike! Guess those jewels didn't do shit. I mean, the thing is-- I'll come out, obviously. I'm going to come out of the mansion. And I'll immediately see Pike. I mean, she's right under the demon. I'm going to-- it's not going to work. I'm going to try to distract him with Trinket, so I'm going to have Trinket attack him as I run in and cast Protection from Poison on Pike. Oh, because yeah, fuck. I was in the mansion. What's going on? Can I say that? I can just see that Pike's unconscious. I rolled a, oh, just intelligence? Five. So I can't even cast that on her. Right. Does Lesser Restoration heal at all? I don't know that she's poisoned. All right, then I'm going to waste my turn completely and try to cast Cure Wounds on her, because that's all I fucking-- I couldn't have run up and looked at her, to know it was poison? To see the black around her fucking--? Cool. 27 for the attack on Trinket, and then that is a 14, no, that's a lie. 11. If I move, I'll get attacked. I'm going to die. Good job, good job. He's already used his attack of opportunity. No, that was me he was doing that to. No, I'm not! Okay. Motherfuck, I'm unconscious again. By one point! For the poison? I've got resistance to poison now, because I cast Protection from Poison on myself. Aw, that's bullshit! God damn it. It's an eight because it's a saving throw. Great. Tight. Oh yeah, you just watched that happen right in front of the door. What did you give him, Taliesin? Do the sword! Yes, attack him as you run by him. No, come on, attack him. Are you fucking kidding me? And the only person that saw it was fucking Keyleth. And all of us have been fucking running. 12. So that's an automatic fail. So thank god I passed, because I would have just died! We're not out of combat. Why Scanlan? Why not me? Vex will remember this. Thank you. Oh no. Well, that sucked. There's one person left before you. I'm in the mansion now. I've got like one hit point. I've got five hit points. Oh Jeebus. Yay! Thank you! No! I'll fly up there and see. I'll grab it all. Matt, before I go in the mansion, I gather up those gems that I threw at the efreet. We probably should've done that on the break. Sure, I'll look at my stuff. I'm up to 100. The rope, and I'm going to pass the boots to Keyleth to look at. Ooh! Here you go. I passed this to you so you could look at them. This is the Rope of Entanglement. The rope is 30 feet long and weighs three pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed a DC of 15 dexterity, or become restrained. Yes. You can release a creature by a bonus action. Target restrained by the rope can use an action-- I'm trying to scan it. And it's a bonus action? Does anybody want this rope? You want the Rope of Entanglement? Did I say what I healed to? I did, right? Yeah. Oh, we should talk to them. They're not in chains, though. Did the servants get the chains off of them? All right, I wander over to them. Hello. Hi. What's your name, darling? Kyor and Hunin? Okay. Of course! How long have you been captured? Oh no! And where did they take you from? Therines? Where is that? Oh, okay! We know where that is. Yeah? She sold you?! Why? You are special. All of us are rather different. I hate that music when I'm talking. It makes me creeped out. What are you going to do to me, you creepy little boys? Yes, Kyor and Hunin. Well, would you feel safe going back to them, or would you like to be with us for a while? To your mother, I mean. Understandable. Well, they've brought you toward us, darling. We're not slavers. We don't want you as slaves. If you'd like to stay with us, we can try to keep you safe. At least, we can get you out of this Fire Plane, if all things go well. How old are you? 15? Well, you can come with us for a while, all right? All right. Did you eat some chicken? Have some chicken. Put some meat on your little bones. Eat quickly, though, because we'll probably be leaving soon. So we could just go straight to-- Okay. Yeah, that's what I mean. Oh, Grog! Share. I take a teeny sip. Pike, would you like any ale? Pass it down. All right. So should we take the boys with us, then? Because we're not necessarily coming back here? Well, then I bamf Trinket back in the-- well, I can bamf him back in when we-- I'm going to leave him out for a while. Let him stretch it out. He's been confined for a bit. You did so good in that fight! You did better than your mom. Yeah. Oh, you kissed Keyleth in the middle of that fight! I walk up to Percy before we put our horrible chains back on, and I grab his hand, and I give him a peck on the cheek and whisper Thank you. Just a peck. I go (grunts). Go away. Yeah, we were. Thank you for the plate mail, as well. Goodbye. Thank you. Thank you. Do you want to put it on now, Pike? Oh my gosh! Oh jeez! And you got rubies all over you and stuff! Beautiful brass scrolling and priceless cut rubies adorn this silver set of amor. No? Oh. Well, okay. Ashley can read it out loud, if you want to. You look amazing, Pike. Is it quieter than her other mail? If she goes unconscious, they get blasted. Guys, we got all the Vestiges! Let's go home and do that. Wait, are we going home or are we going-- Or should we go home first? Yeah, but we can't take care of it right now. He'd make us owe him another fucking favor. No, but we'd have to walk all the fuck back! All right. Then let's fucking go! If you want some autographs-- What is it? Can I roll an insight check? Just to see. No, not a natural 20. This is not my night. Is this the size of the ashes, the box? And a promise. It will be done. Okay. Hey, Senokir, do you have any fire potions? Some emblem? Got it. Thank you, Senokir. (laughter) Oh, I bamf Trinket back in my necklace so that we have enough. Consequences. Man, maybe we shouldn't have gone back to Senokir. And we're not dead. But it's only been a day and a half, so nobody has got here yet. Is the next playlist still going to go up the day after Thanksgiving, or is that going to be two weeks from now? (singing) Let's give them something to talk about! Oh, and those winners, those are going out this weekend to the winners, just so you guys know.
