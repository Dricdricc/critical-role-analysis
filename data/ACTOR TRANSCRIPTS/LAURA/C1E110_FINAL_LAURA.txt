Did you? What did you say about merchandise? Cool. Sorry about that. Do I still have Pass Without a Trace on us? I will be behind them. Yeah, I'm bamfing him out right now. I didn't get to sort them. You can read Dwarven now! You can read now, Grog. You can read four- to five-letter words. Thanks, Scanlan. Let's do that. Keep moving up, right? That's where the city is. While she's doing a nature check, I want to do Primeval Awareness and sense undead in the area. Within a mile of me. Within the mile? Are they all above us or are some near us? What if we Earthquake the titan? To fucking fall apart! Yeah, but we could take out the entire city. But it couldn't move for a while. Potentially. It could shit out a lot of dwarven zombies. "Yeah." Mostly Liam. What do you think he just did? Do you think he just fell? We'll keep going quickly, then. We probably should, right? I want to go with him. I need to keep an eye out for the zombie dwarves. That's good. Add ten to it! I crawled up, but then, once he took off again, then I stayed. I guess we follow. I think that means that there's a split in the path. Scanlan, you go one way, and we'll go the other. If it's facing us. No. Its right, our left. Percy! Keyleth! Keyleth, dig him out! I start clawing at the wall where he was. I would be closer to Percy than Trinket is. No! Wait. Oh no! You guys, guess what we didn't do? We didn't have a feast. 21 as well. How do we fight rocks? That sounded like you were casting a spell. But you slice his fingers off when he does it! Okay. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark. On the biggest one. This one. And then I'm going to shoot him. With sharpshooter! Wait, okay. Oh no. 19 minus five. 14. Yeah, you motherfucker. Okay. 16. Wait, I didn't say sharpshooter! I didn't say sharpshooter on that one, did I? I didn't clarify. It would be 21. I should've said it, but I didn't say it. 16 plus five lightning damage. And then, since he is next to Scanlan, I get sneak attack? Ooh, 12. 15 sneak attack! And then Hunter's Mark, three. Yeah. I'm going to stay where I am. Don't you add six, though? Natural 20! The ground raised up? She's fine. Oh wait, that's Pike. Hold on. Yes, it hits me. My armor class is 21. Can we shoot him with an arrow as he sinks into the ground? They're all vanishing! Squish him! Make a building out of him! I don't know. Now I've got David Bowie in my head. He got bigger? That's so cool. Look how much bigger she is than those fucks! Aw, buddy! You're okay! Well, I would, if it was Trinket's turn. Pike's going to run down and stand between Scanlan and Grog. "Oh, Grog!" Yeah. And then she's going to hold her action until a thing appears. Attacking. Oh, right. Okay. I'm going to call Trinket away from the wall, so he's going to run down next to Grog. And then I'm going to kick off and get on my broom, so I'm off the ground. Don't speak! How high is the ceiling in here? Yeah, I'm going to want to hover right in the middle. I don't want to be high up. I want to be right between the ceiling and the floor. Yeah. (Southern accent) And I'm going to hold my action until I can see one of those things. Uh-huh. Pass Without a Trace is still-- Oh, no. No, I Hunter's Marked. The minute something shows, we're all going to be like, boom! But nothing's going to show. Thanks, Grog. Oh no! Down there? Why does it matter that we're clustered? Yeah, they can still sense you! And then we won't know that you didn't get sucked under! Oh, shut up, that's so cool! Ten feet. Oh no! Oh no, he rolled a one! Oh no, this was a fan gift. Oh no! Is Trinket right next to Grog, at least? Oh, now Trinket's all alone! And me? Yeah, that's a thing. 26! Okay. The first one definitely hits. The second one is 18. Awesome! Are you fucking kidding me? He's not Hunter's Marked. 27, combined. Yeah. I need more coffee. Oh, good! She can attack him! I want to do it. I should not have claimed this. Oh. We don't add anything to it. She was saving her action, though! It doesn't hit. I put my foot on its fist and-- Oh my god, thank you so much! I know! But I didn't think anybody was going to do it, really! Go for the gnome! That means she can still attack? She can't see anything, though. No, I mean, there's nothing to attack in front of her. He's underground, still. We're holding a physical action, so she has to be next to something in order to attack it. Did you use all your movement? Can you get within ten feet of something? Five feet of something. "I want to be able to hit it if it comes up!" Oh man! Should she do a cantrip? She should do a Resistance or something? But that's an action, it's not a bonus. I'm going to help. I'm right there. That's what I'm going to be aiming at, darling. He's raging! He doesn't have logic! Okay, I'm going to move my Hunter's Mark over to that dude (radar sounds) and then I'm going to attack him with sharpshooter! So I'm at 20? Okay. This is so weird! Four lightning damage. 28 for the first arrow. Plus the four lightning damage. And then the second attack is also sharpshooter, and that one hits. Yes. Definitely. Six lightning damage. 19! Oh! And I didn't add plus 20 to both of those! Plus 20 overall because of the sharpshooter. You're welcome! I'm going to stay. Wait! What about Trinket? Can he try to save against it? I don't know what the difference for a saving throw for Trinket would be. 15. Can I hear him? Does he make noise? I don't even know it's Trinket, do I? I aim my bow at it. She's attacking it. Does it? No, she gets to act first. Yeah! So that's 24 to attack. She always gets that now. That's 2d6 plus four radiant damage, so ten, 14. Should that count? It's not as good as the unintentional, but that's okay. 19. Yeah. Does she just attack the once? She goes, "Grog, watch this!" You can see; you're big. Yeah, because she got trapped. Be careful! I think there's another elemental right there. I think Trinket's an elemental. Oh no, don't you make me attack my own bear. Oh no. 17? Trinket! I run. I would see you the minute you attacked. Oh, we got to take off, we got to start moving. Run. I think she's saying run. As we're running I cast Pass Without A Trace again. Should I? Okay, never mind, I don't cast it. Is it old? Is this--? No, this is not mountain. This is titan. Okay, so not Underdark? Do we know what gods dwarves worshipped? Do they have specific gods? Five. She had stealth boots. Yeah, but it doesn't matter because she's got the Dawnmartyr. Do you know where? Can you sense where it is? You want to fight it? And there's no other exit from this cylindrical chamber? Okay. Oh, I mean we could try it. I'll put Pike on the broom. And we'll fly over to the side of the cave-in? Yeah, but she can turn undead. As an action. As an action. Yeah. Oh wait, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests. And is she 18th level? Ooh, so now she can do it three times between rests. So we should try to get her in and turn him? Okay. Yeah, let's do that. Percy really wants to find treasure. Well, we could just turn around and walk away and find our way up to the city! All right. Okay, okay, okay, I'm going to cast Pass Without A Trace on us now. It could just be a fight to take away our stuff, before we go to a bigger fight. Yeah, fine. Oh my god, come on! We cannot wait for 15 minutes! While he's doing that? What, say it again? You should open the door. You should open the door. Yeah! 16. No, Grog!! Ready to Turn Undead. Can Pike see undead in there? Plus 11? 20. Can we see anything that points to what deity it is from inside the chamber? Can we see anything? Oh, yeah, no. What about Pike though, because she's looking in. 13. You're going to try to undo the trap? (groans) Luck? Okay, good. Are you making sure nothing's invisible in there? I'm peeking in the door. Yeah. They're not locking. You were shutting them as you went. It's not that they were locked. They were trapped. Just wanted to double check! Ah, it's all empty? I look over at Percy. It makes me far too uncomfortable how excited you are about this. Oh no, oh no, you rolled too low! It's okay. Well, it's not okay. He's got better constitution. 75 points of poison damage. Oh! That's good. The box is empty! Was it worth it? There's a center cylinder. There is an undead thing, maybe one undead guy got stuck in the middle. You know what, Scanlan, you should probably bamf inside and see. No, no, I'm joking! Oh shit. There's no traps. No, let's just pick his for this. I'm not in this room. Outside the door. Seven. Oh my god. So Pike is--? Pike runs over and casts Greater Restoration on Scanlan. No, you're not. Scanlan, no you're not. She gets ready. She casts Turn Undead. Yeah, so she should do that. Pike's going to rush in as he's doing that and try to rip the hammer away from the body and run out of the room. She's like, "Well!" Check for traps, because we've been there, darling. We've been there. Check for fucking traps. How about nobody dies. Get out. I found a hammer, Grog. Is it cursed? Can we tell? If it's cursed? Can we tell if it's bad? I don't know. Yeah. Here. Does it feel magic? We suck. What about the belt? Oh! It needs attunement. Just to have it. This is totally worth it. We don't know what any of this shit is. You can do what? Yeah, the other fucking direction. Does it look like that thing in the Nine Hells that we saw? Or in the City of Brass? (gentle old man impression) Thank god you're here! I've been-- You don't know what Matt would've done with whatever you think! Eww. What is that? Do any of us know what it was? Read it out loud. Okay, that's really big. What is this creature? Do we know what this creature is? Scanlan. With disadvantage. Oh, well that's better than four. Is there anything else interesting in this cavern? That we can see? Yes, thank you for informing us. Oh man, yeah. Uncharted The Lost Legacy came out this week. You should check it out! I play Nadine. You should go see it. Go see it, and then play it. Yeah, and also Marvel's Spider-Man show premiered on the 19th. I'm Gwen Stacy on that. I saw the episode, too, and it was really good. I wanted to look in the chamber and see if there was anything else interesting before we walked out. I didn't roll it. 29. Do they look rich? Okay. We're in a hurry, right? I'm not going to go search for stuff. Yeah, I'll look around. 21. No hinges, no nothing. Did you want to smash your way through this very loudly? No. Yeah, maybe try to push it first. A really old fart. Can I feel if there's any wind coming from one of the tunnels, like there's an opening somewhere that leads out? Yeah, I want to feel the wind on my face. Thanks. 25 for wind! (laughter) Can I tell where it's coming from? Her mace. I think there's an exit ahead and to the right. (whispering) Maybe you should kill it before it says anything to you. I don't know. This is all you! That fast?! Oh fuck. Indianapolis! Oh, I guess I'd be next to-- Bear is with Grog. Trinket really likes Grog. He's a big guy! 24! Oh, I didn't roll for Pike. Ooh! 16 for Pike. Hunter's Mark! That troll that I see. I'm going to Hunter's Mark Grog. Okay. And I'm going to shoot him. With a natural one. Okay, this one is going to be sharpshooter with Blazing Bowstring, so hopefully-- goddamn it! What the fuck? Oh my god, that's 11 to hit. Jesus H. Macy! Can I climb up those rocks behind me and stand on the top of them? And then Trinket is going to run over and stand next to Pike. He's going to try to protect us. Can he move far enough to be on the other side of her? 40. Yeah, he goes to the other side. Really, that's what she's going to do? I guess it's undead. She can't try to turn undead? Fine. 23! Great. Good. It takes an additional 2d6 radiant because he's undead. With her Mace of Disruption. I just did; it's seven. 2d6 plus four radiant damage. So that's what all he rolled, and then since it's undead, it's an additional 2d6. An additional seven because he's undead. Whoa, fuck yeah! One for each. Can't she move away from him? Oh, no, because he will get an attack. Oh yeah, you've been trying to attune to it. He started attuning to it as soon as Percy felt something from the belt, so if it's been long enough? Are you going to attack the guy with it? Oh no. This is something weird. Is it like if you roll below a certain thing you hit yourself instead? Oh my god, roll high! Wait, you forgot to add stuff? He's going to get back up. Is there other shit in there? He goes for Keyleth? Those are good attacks without sneak attack. No, 25 to hit. I know. That's the problem. None of us want to do anything. They're regenerating. Something's holding them together. That's why I was hoping my bowstrings would work, but I missed my shot. T-pose, please. Yeah, I don't have any of that. Well, but my Blazing Bowstring. I'm going to try it. I'm going to shoot the one that I tried to hit before. Yeah. I'm going to do it. I'm going to try sharpshooter again. Goddamn it. That doesn't hit. (sighs) Okay, I'm going to try it again. Yeah. Plus 14, minus five. That one hits! That definitely hits. That is, yeah. So that hits, right? Okay. I didn't say Blazing Bowstring, so it doesn't count. 14 plus one lightning damage. Yeah, sneak attack. Plus six is 14 for the sneak attack. and then five for Hunter's Mark. I didn't say Blazing Bowstring. For my bonus-- oh wait, that's a 4th-level spell. Should I use it or not? All right, I'll save it. I'm going to transfer the Hunter's Mark to the one attacking my brother. And then Trinket is going to run up and stand next to my brother so you can get flank attack. Should she do turn undead? Each undead she can see within 30 feet. Yeah! They're scared of her! Yeah, they have to move away. If it's got nowhere to move, it can use dodge. It doesn't say, does it? One minute, or until it takes any damage. Nice. At least it can't do a bite attack any more. What the fuck is this stupid-ass hammer? Are you drunk? We've got to chop it up or set it on fire. What does that mean? I know. I don't know what it means! 23. Jeez, Scanlan! You need better armor! You're going to smoke everybody? Is it possible to do it without hitting Grog? It's Scanlan's choice. You're a dick. Oh, motherfuck! 11. Can you use that wand again? You can do that?! You didn't even see it! No, I'm going to fly over. Can I get to a place where I can see the troll? Well, how many is this? I have 50 feet on my broom. I'm going to shoot him! And he's still Hunter's Marked! 17? Oh, thank god. I didn't say it; it didn't happen. 13 plus three lightning damage. Plus one Hunter's Mark. 21. The Blazing Bowstring? Blazing Bowstring. Sorry. I only get two per short rest, so if we don't rest, then I don't get it again! Six lightning damage, plus nine, plus two. 11. But that's the exit. That's where we need to go to? Shit! Would Trinket have been able to make it over to him? (singing) Guiding Bolt up the butt! I don't think so. 12. Guiding Bolt! We need to get out of here. It's crumbling. I go check for traps on that chest right there. 14. All right, then I'm going to open it. Awesome. Look at all this money! I'm going to pick up that little pile of gold, those couple pieces of gold I see on the ground. Can you get through it, Keyleth? Whatever other tunnel options, there's probably other monsters, trolls, fucking undead waiting there, too. She's going to try to Greater Restoration Grog. Do you have time to attune to your other thing? Is it?
