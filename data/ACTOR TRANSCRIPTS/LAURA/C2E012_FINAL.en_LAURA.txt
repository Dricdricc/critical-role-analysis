I've always known that about you. Wait, leave it on, because you kind of look like Estelle Getty. (laughter) Right ready to go. My mom called me today, and she's like, “I'm watching you in the WonderCon panel.” I was like, oh no. What did I say? (laughter) Was it? It's true love, baby. Oh, this shirt?! Thank you. This is our first maternity shirt. Well, half a day, and then a whole other day. Where are we right now? Wait, what did you say? I wasn't listening. There was a spiderweb in the corner of the room and it's really pretty. Yes, I am! Why do you ask? Yes, I’m very good at writing letters. Well, I guess we we’ll just have to find a letter within their house, and then I can forge it right away. I'm a really quick thinker and I'm also a pretty fast writer. Okay. But how will we leave something from the High-Richter if I don't know actually what her handwriting looks like yet? A public record of her handwriting? She is a judge after all, right? This is very complicated. What if I go find the High-Richter and ask for her autograph? Yeah! Really? That’s right. She was vain. Oh yes, we had one of those at our house. Well, no, we just had a lot of secrets. (silence) I bet that the people in the Knights-- previously Knights-- they would know where Lord Sutan lives. Don't we know where Dolan lives? Oh, yes. Harold? Horris. We can't be seen. We'd have to be in disguise, or one of us. Yes. Let's go that way. Go get him, monk. Should we go to Dolan's house? Maybe the Richter's handwriting, too. Ulog’s probably listening to us right now. We shouldn't be seen with them. Go do it, Fjord. You're not going up there with him, right? Because he's in disguise now. You look the same, Beau. (screeching bird call) I thought that was a hawk. (as pigeon) High-Richter's handwriting! Oh, I thought Sutan was a title, like Lord Lord Lord. (as pigeons) High-Richter! (as pigeon) We need it more! High-Richter! (laughter) We need the handwriting of the High-Richter more than Lord Sutan's handwriting. (exasperated sound) (laughter) Fuck! (as pigeon) High-Richter! Did you get the handwriting? Did you get the handwriting of the High-Richter? Fjord, we need it. Really bad. Did you not get it? Just say, hey, the whole point of this was to find the High-Richter's handwriting as well, and maybe-- Whoa, that is really good, Fjord, you did a really good job in there. What if we get some parchment that says from the home office of Lord Sutan? Or we can go up, a few of us, through the actual front gates and then meet up with everyone. Okay. Oh. I thought Beau might be able to get through the gates, actually. Huh? Yeah and it's not a magical disguise. Okay. (distraught) Well it's such a thing to get into the sewers. We have to make a distraction and everything, every time. Right. Yes, we won't get into any trouble. We know our way around. Or just at the Leaky Tap. Let's just meet back at the Leaky Tap. Yeah. Let's go. Woo! She came through earlier. She's with me. How high are the buildings next to the house? Okay. That seems usable. Like a five feet jump? From, like a swinging branch? Are there windows on that side of the house? Is there a balcony connected to them? So a few guards. A dog. I love dogs. Okay. I wonder if anything would lure the guards away from the house. Maybe. Maybe a drunk trying to talk to them in the front of the house or something. Or in the back. Yeah. Some people jump up and over? Yeah. Oh man. Maybe we could get some rope and a grapple. We could throw a grapple for ten feet, I know that. We can go get a climber's kit. We did a good job scouting this place out and stuff. Are they pointy-top iron bars? I bet it does. Can you stick your fingers through the bar? Yeah. Disintegrate. Oh no. Mm-hmm? That's personal Marisha experience isn't it? I feel like that would be a really good idea. I feel like it might be a little noticeable to carry around a rug. Most people in the Tri-Spire don't carry around bedrolls. Yes but it's little. You're not there. I think-- are we good? What if we don't want the whole kit, just the grapple part of it and the rope? And the rope? What is fully included in the climber's kit? Yes that would probably be a good idea. (whispering) The cheaper one. That I use for different things. I don't use them at all. Okay. I'll get rid of-- I'll pay for it. Simon became a real boy. Gross. Spend an hour painting your dick? Ugh. In your butt. Oh my god. No, no, he’s pointing the other direction! They’re looking at him, but you were running away. Why do you smell like beer? Gross. Did you go in and say “Can I speak to Ren?” and then somebody else go in his office while somebody was in the front asking to talk to Ren? Oh, okay. Oh, well, we cased out his house. We found a big tree that we can hop the fence with. Oh, and we bought this rope and this grapple so that we can climb. Well, so that we can break into the house, yes. Is that what all of these things are? I cast Cure Wounds on Molly. Yeah, nobody mentioned anything about needing handwriting, right? No talk of his father at all, right-- Well, we have Ren’s handwriting. We could potentially put a note in somebody’s house with his stuff, but I don’t know if that’s what the plan is. “H-R wants a meeting with you.” The Big O. We should say Big O. I’ll start writing that note right now. I’ll make it look crisp and-- Yeah, like evil handwriting. Yeah. Got your messages. I will move the meeting up and the Big O is going to die for sure. But where are we going to get this money you keep talking about? Here’s the thing, having seen people be bribed before you need very large sums of money for bribing. Especially with rich people. They’re not going to need 500 gold to do this sort of thing, they want 5000 gold for this sort of thing. A check? An IOU. “On behalf of HR-- “ So no hearts above the i’s then? I write, “On behalf of HR-- “ What comes after that? “On behalf of HR, the plan-- “ “The plan is moving up to tomorrow night, at the festival.” That’s what I write. “Yours truly, forever and ever, your BFF-- “ No? Yeah, I thought it was good. If I fold it up like a little triangle. Just a simple-- Oh wait! Should I fold it or should I scroll it? Can the cat get the dog-- Yeah. They’ll chase after the dog. We can try that. If it doesn’t work, then we try to jump up and over. And relieve him. Say that somebody really wants him over at the party. Watching your face, Matt, as all that was happening. You were like, what are they doing? (shouting) Pillow fight! Ow, okay. We're done. Maybe we should so that we stealth better. We can put it in the pink bag. The carnival is going on today? Well, we're not actually going to the fancy gala, so we probably don't need the fancy stuff, because it's just for the rich people. Well, I figure for all of us to get in, we should go through the sewers, probably. Sure. Yeah. Let's go buy some masks, then. There's no point in worrying about things you can't change yet, Caleb. Oh, and I'm going to write another letter that says something about the Knights of Requital. That says, like-- what should it be? "I'm glad to be working with you! You sure are nice!" Yeah. I'll end it with, "the big red door. The Knights of Requital." Then rip it, and then it is just the bottom part and leave it in the High-Richter's house. Oh, can somebody burn the edge like the rest was in the fire or something? Oh, and then we can put it in the fireplace like the rest of the letter was burned! Caleb, burn just these edges here. But just the edges, don't set the whole thing on fire, because I spent a really long time writing that little bit. I write all of that, okay, fine. Yeah. Then I'll put the symbol. But I'm also going to keep this one to put in the fireplace, because I think it will be really cool. Now we have those letters. I'm going to keep track, I'm putting them in the side pouch, those are the side pouch ones. Is that going in Lord Sutan's place or the High-Richter's place? So I'm putting that in the other pouch. We are definitely-- this is going to be real good. What are we being paid for this? Is Ulog around? I'm going to look for Ulog. I want to look and see if he's around us, though. I can't see shit. I should definitely go into Lord Sutan's place, because I have this really fun spell that lets me find things. So I could find the seal. I go, "I want to find this wax seal," and it will help me find the one that’s closest. You're going to steal some stuff? Sausage for the guard, cat for the dog. Where are we meeting Ulog? Do you want to eat him even more now? Oh, I wonder if we can hide under the carriages and just ride in. It's all about trying to get into the sewer system. Let's just go to the sewers. Maybe I can go talk to the guard. Distract him? Oh, he's not even looking at the gate? It's dark outside, too? Oh, sure! I'll go meet you at the sewer entrance on the other side. Okay. I walk up to the guard. Evening, how are you doing today? Pretty good. I was wondering if you could answer a question for me. I was looking around this area earlier for a candy shop and I couldn't find anything that seemed good. I was wondering if you could point me in the best direction. The Pentamarket, um, okay. Can you tell me exactly where that is? Because I'm not familiar with the area. Oh no. Oh, that's okay. 19! Yay! Oh, come on. (fake coughs loudly) Can you help me? I think I’m choking. Oh no. Seven. (fake coughs loudly) Oh no, I can’t breathe at all, though. I fall over on the ground and really like (choking sounds). (choking sounds) Oh, it was my spit. I was choking on my own spit. Thank you very much for all of your help. Oh, we didn’t meet the guy at the Song and Supper. Yeah, I just remembered it. I’m going to the Song and Supper Inn. We were waiting for you! It’s so weird that we totally missed you, though. Well, well, well, 11. They are-- Here’s the thing. How rich do you look? How rich does he look? Can I put some of my costume on him? I’ll put some of my festive wear on him. It’ll get you in the door, don’t worry. Here, put this mask on. Oh, that’s great! Guest of honor for the night. He’s a comedian. Come on! It is being so mean! Seven. God damn it. Here’s the thing. He’s not a joke-telling kind of comedian. He’s more of a farce kind of comedian. Physical comedy. It’s more like a jester, if you will. And I push him and-- so he falls down. See? He’s so good. He really sells it. But I got you in the door, right? I got Ulog. I know! I have no freaking clue! Hey Ulog, what do you want to do? Okay. We cased it earlier. Yes. It would look really pretty on you. I think yellow would look good on you. Oh wait. Who sucks? Who hasn’t rolled yet? Taliesin I give you a blessing. 20. But there’s still a gate-- How wide are the openings in the gate? Does it look like the mastiff could get through the openings in the wrought-iron fence? We could use the tree to get over the fence and then run to the cellar. He walks up to him and say-- Ulog? What do you think? You’re really good at this. That was at the High-Richter’s house. That wasn’t here. Right. We can climb a tree. We’re good at that. And I got this grapple, so we can swing across to the roof on the other side. Or let him create it the first time, because we might not need it. We swing it over. Somebody needs to make a loud noise when we throw the grapple over. So that it doesn't make a clang sound that they hear. I could maybe use, like, Thaumaturgy to create a thunder sound. If it happens at the same time. Okay, I'll do that. Sometimes thunder happens out of nowhere. Oh, good. Do we get advantage because Beau's helping us? Shh! I rolled 11. Should I try it? It's a grapple. Connected to a rope. So I hand the other side of the rope to Ulog so it doesn't fall. Well, I'm strong. Yeah, but you're weak, aren't you? No, but you're precise. Yeah. On three? Okay, I'll throw it. Oh, that was good, okay. 11. No! 12. Thunder, thunder! When I did it. More thunder. Another thunder. I do another thunder sound right when I pull it, so it doesn't make noise. Here! It is a strength thing, though. No. No, Ulog was holding onto the end of it. I catch-- I try to catch the rope to try to keep it from hitting the ground. I'll try. I did; I tried! I rolled a 19. I don't know what I'm adding. You can jump ten feet? Oh, dear lord. What if you fall on the ground, Beau? Yeah! Just so it's not a one. No ones! The rope's not-- Oh, were you holding onto the grapple? Great. So we'll tie off the other side-- Yeah. (whispers) We shimmy. Well, we do that-- When we lower into the cellar, right when-- Well how--? Is there a door on the roof? How would there be a stupid door on the roof? There's no balconies. Maybe like an attic access or something? I think we should go in through the roof. We already shimmied. Hey, Nott. Send a message to Fjord and say, "Hey, did we look cool, just then?" Pry at the shingles. Look at how deep these go. Who gives a shit? Who's going to be on the fucking roof? Not everyone can fit through the chimney. I cast thunder. Thaumaturgy. There's a fire in there. What if we pull up these shingles? And, like, stack them. I'll hold it open if you guys go scout. What spell? I am distracted by looking at this beautiful piece of art. I think I studied this artist back at home. Oh, okay. It only last for ten minutes though when I do it. So if we don't find it soon then-- I'm going to-- I'm sure Ulog can look for traps, because he's also a rogue, right? Ulog, help us. Please. I'm going to cast Locate Object. Cast spell. I'm going to search for a wax seal. Like traps? Or they are just-- So we won't touch them. Are those traps would set them off? Oh my gosh! How great because we came in-- We have to avoid the traps. So duck down. It's like The Neverending Story. Don't be afraid, you guys, just go! It's like a training session. Come on this only lasts ten minutes let's go! Okay. Detect for traps. Look for traps on this door. How do we disarm a trap? Flying carpet! Look for traps in the room. I did, but hurry! Where is the glow for the seal is coming from? Well, I need to move it because the seal is under the rug. So move the fucking carpet! Move the rug. You just unlocked the fucking metal shit! I got to get that seal! Use the Mage Hand to move the carpet. I hand the two letters that we made for Lord Sutan. We're fighting a carpet. Whoa, look at that carpet! So we're rolling initiative, that's what we're doing? 17. Okay, I'm going to cast Guiding Bolt on it. Roll a ranged attack. Oh! Natural 19. That's 4d6. Radiant. 15 damage, and the next attack has advantage against it. (gasping) Oh no! Oh no, I'm sorry, Nott! Where am I? Oh no, how do we get it off? No, but we can't damage it. I'm going to go stand on the bed! No, but-- No, but you just heard Nott scream! Oh no, you're going to kill Nott! We have to try to pull the rug off of-- We have to out-strength the rug! Oh, no. How do we defeat this rug before it kills all of us? I'm going to try to go help Nott and I'm going to do the same thing. I'm going to try to pry the rug off of Beau. That's a number. It's a 12. I wonder if there's something in the room that will-- Turn it off. No, because the thing in the fireplace. It's looking weak. Vengeance. I will. I cast Cure Wounds on her. Eight points. The rug is shredded. He's going to know we were in his room because the rug is messed up. Okay. Okay. Let's gather up the pieces of the rug so it's not, you know. Check the fucking thing if it's trapped. No, check the thing on the ground and see if it's trapped first. What does it have in it? No, Nott's paralyzed holding onto the chest. I am petting Nott's head and going Don't worry, in the morning, I can take a spell that will heal you, so we'll carry you out here, okay? Everything will be fine. No, it's got the seal in it. Does it have the seal in it? Okay. I sit down. Oh, do we see his handwriting anywhere? Any letters? Okay. I'll sit down and I'll write a letter really fast that says, "The plan--" No, that's different. Those are letters we were leaving here. Yeah. We didn't actually write that letter yet because I was waiting for his handwriting. Sure, why not? (gasps) Let me see! Okay! I look at it and then I sit down and write the letter and go-- okay, what's her name? The High-Richter's letter's first name? Dayana, okay. I'm going to write Dayana, got your message, our plan is moving forward exactly as we discussed. The Myriad has our back! Sure. Then sign it Lord Sutan. Oh! And something about the Big-O going down. The Big-O will go down. Roll my proficiency plus my intelligence. Aw, my intelligence?! Why not wisdom? (laughter) Nine. Advantage? (sighs) Ooh, that's so much better! 22! This is really good. I roll it up, heat up the wax, seal it-- Put the letter in the bag. We have it for later. Then I go and pick up Nott. Let's get out of here. Does anyone have any books around? I'm going to take out one of the pamphlets for the Traveler and stick it into one of the books. Okay, and then I pick up Nott! I pick up Nott. I walk her as we tiptoe across the roof. Oh god. Move. I will. I'm going to try to hook Nott over me. So like she's attached. Five. I save Nott and I'll fall. Three stories. (pained) Oh. Thaumaturgy. Thunder. Am I on the outside of the-- Okay, that's great. Am I 12 damage? Okay. They hurt me so bad. But I was helping because I'm bloody. But I'm staying at the Pillow Trove tonight. Oh. Oh my god. We are booking it to try to get to the sewer entrance so we can get back in. I've got the fucking letters. Oh yeah, I have the disguise charm. You want to try? Is there another entrance we can go to? Well, it'll probably be faster to do that than to go-- Okay. We'll book it to the other entrance. I'm pristine and sober. I know. We're going to the gala. Obviously. Okay! 18. Yes. We run as soon as we’re in. I guess I'll cast Cure Wounds on myself as we're running. Okay, eight points healed. Yeah. Okay. So we're trying to avoid the guard so we don't get spotted again and get kicked out again. That went really well, I think. Did we put everything back in order before we left the room? We did, right? Yes, we did. The magical rug. Yeah, there was a rug that turned to life and attacked us. Let's go! We go to the High-Richter's house. Maybe-- Fjord. You want to be a guard and I can look like the High-Richter? Okay. Yes. Okay. I cast Disguise Self and look like the High-Richter. (muttering) Oh, god. Yes, but she was probably going to the gala tonight. There's no time. I'm going to put her in a cloak that looks like it had wine spilled on it. Like, covering up the rest of the outfit, a big-- A white cloak that looks like it had red wine spilled down the front. Fjord, you explain to the guards that I'm very pissed off because someone spilled their drink on me. Why are you going in? We're disguised and we're walking straight up. I look incredibly angry. Just walking?! Why? I'm walking! That's 18. I breathe really hard. Is anybody inside the house? There were a lot of traps in the last house we were in. Why? Why are we adding more things to this? Same, I'm looking around. There was a little brick that turned off all the magic things in the other place, so maybe can I look around on the walls and see if there's some sort of-- To see if there's a trigger to stop all the traps? Let's turn them. We turn them together. One, two, three. (stone grinding) Yeah, sure. We start walking to look for her room. You've been made! What's that? Do you think somebody just got home? Okay. We keep looking for traps up on the top floor and looking for a bedroom. Nice, 15 for me. What's a gable window? Okay. This might be a good place to leave the letter. Should we look for traps in here? One more time, we're looking for more traps. Nice. I rolled a 12 investigation. I respond, and I say We're upstairs in her bedroom or office or something. Oh god, these lookouts! I feel along the edge under her mattress and see if I can feel any keys. Anything she's like stuck-- I'm reaching under her mattress and seeing if she's stuck anything between. Natural 20! (cheering) (laughs) Volume one. Oh, she's naughty. I run over with the letter and can we put it in her desk to hide it? The sealed letter. Oh, is there a fireplace? Is there a wastebasket? Caleb, I swear to fucking gods. Okay, I'll take the-- oh! I'm going to take the torn piece and hide it under her bed. Then I have the letter left, the Knights of Requital letter. Where should I put this? On the desk as well? No, we should scatter it around so that if certain things don't get found-- is there any other good place like, in her bedside tables or anything like that? Is there clutter on the desk at all, or decorations and stuff? I'll fold up the Knights of Requital letter and hide it under her clock. Leave a little bit showing in the back, so that someone could find if they're investigating. Are there any windows? Can we see anything out the window? Is anybody coming, is-- Does it look like the gala is ending? Perception check? 21. So we can show this as evidence. Somebody just got home! Run, run! Everything's set! Run! Out the back door! Somebody's coming. No-- I was going to say I cast Guiding Bolt at her, but-- (whispers) Oh, I had it! Shitballs! Yeah, I had it prepared, and that's what I wanted to cast. (fake sobs) I cast Hold Person on her! I'm just going to do it. We should take off while he does it. (gasps) We have to get out of here! I run down, I grab Caleb, and we run out the back door. Finally. I don't have any spells left! That went so bad! We’re running to the sewers! Five. Steer clear of lightning people! We need to get back to the other side. Oh my gosh. They were targeting-- I don't know! Are you sure they weren't looking for us? Like the Cobalt people? I've never seen someone fly before. The High-Richter's dead, you guys. That wasn't part of the plan! Be aware of the rat balloons. Does it look dark? Everything went to shit! Oh my gosh. It's so good.
