You should because it's really good. Yeah, do it all again? The Forcs! Wait, did we actually take a short rest? I thought it was intentional. We took a moment, so I didn't actually get my action surge back. Am I? Don't you worry about it, Samuel. Should I run down there and kill him? I don't know. Maybe we can lead him toward us and then-- Yeah, and then you can take him out away from the guards that're sleeping. What if we hit him with a rock and he comes looking for it? Oh, that's a good idea! And I take a really big branch and I break it in half. (hooting) I'm trying to sound like an owl in the night. Hoo-hoo! Okay. I like it. Do I roll at advantage, then? Oh, I rolled a three. Minus two. Oh no! Hit him before he does that! 22 times two. Do it! Rip it out quietly! You should snap its neck! It's quieter! He's a creative one, Mozuu. I think they know we're here. We didn't take a short rest, though. That would've been real smart. Maybe I should rest while this is going on because I should really rest. You're going to sleep too! Wow, 5d8?! It's 5d8 of--? Oh, okay, I know. No. Eight. You could hide so they can't see you. I'm going to jump down. I'm going to run at them and attack the one that's got him. Oh no. Four! Slam down with my maul right as I hit the ground! I'll use my second attack to hit another one! I'm screaming as I'm doing it. 24! Deet de deet de deet. Ooh, ah! 15! Like a gnat, that one! Ha ha, ha! No. That's a load of shrak, that is! That's right. Unbreakable. That's me. Kill the weak one! Wait, seven times two, because it was a critical. So 14. You're so speedy. I walk over and use my maul and smash down on one of the ones that's sleeping. Ooh, 16 plus eight, so that's definitely going to hit, and it's not a crit. Yeah! 20 plus five, 25! Here! I'll catch you! No, of course not! Right as he jumps, I let go and start picking my nose. Don't bite his throat. I start grabbing at him like it's a piece of paper blowing in the wind. Oh no! Athletics, or what? Athletics is ten. 25! We're going to ask you some questions. Seven. I lift him up, hanging by his ankle. Do we want to use him as a pi√±ata? Who do you serve? Who do you work for? Who sent you? Where are you from? Who do you work for? All right! I drop him. Should we take a short rest while we talk about him? Can I sit down? I'm going to sit down and listen to what he's saying. He can't break me. I'm unbreakable. Man-swine! Can you show us in 30 minutes? Because I want to take a short break. We'll pretend that we're the guards that we just killed. I'm going to use him as a pillow as I take a short rest. No, but then we'd be-- Doesn't work as well. If you join us, you could be my pillow as long as you want. I fluff him up and lay down. Almost full, not quite. It's okay, Borg-borg. Well, he said his name twice! All right, I sit up. You're very comfy. I start taking his ropes off him as I pat his little head. Well, because I thought he needs to walk? I don't understand what the problem is. All right. Should I undo his feet then? Okay. Is the Bright Lord down there? Do all of you wear special hats or something? That's pretty. I could wear that. You want me to give it a try? All right, I walk over to Mozuu and slap him as hard as I can across the face. Five. I can't understand you. And then what? No, no, the Man-eater. The Face-eater. Good idea! I start yanking his robes off of his hands. His robes off? His ropes off of his hands. I'll take his robes off too, just in case. All right, I give him his robes back. Sorry. Ooh, 22. It's toward the bottom. That's a nice camp. They've got a real nice camp. There's caragors! Should we hide behind rocks? It's caragors. Yeah, like real big-sounding ones. I also try to duck behind a rock. I'm going to duck behind a rock and wait for one to show its face around a rock, and then I'm going to hit it with my maul. Seven. Sneaky sneaky! No, but I have a bell! Yeah. Well, it's a bell! It makes noise. I throw the bell as far away as I can! I throw the bell! 18! Oh wait, no, 15. Because it's not a saving throw. I look up. Is it like right above the head? So I could take my maul and go like this! Too late. 26. (laughing) Aw. 11. I think it saw us. 17? Yes! 12. Oh, it's so much bigger than I thought it was. No! We got more of them than they have. It's okay. Oh no. Nine. Not a bit. 25. I'm going to spin around and try to hit the one that's standing on me. Yeah. Ooh, 26. Aw. Dang. Plus seven plus five is 12. I'm going to try to hit it again. That's a 19. 14. Eden! Do you want me to try to hit that one too? I'm going to action surge and try to run up to the other one and attack it too. That's a 24. Are you kidding me?! Sorry, that's seven points of damage. Ooh, natural 20 on the next hit! 25 points of damage. Yes, it does. Plus your sneak attack. You're supposed to double your dice, all of your dice. Yep. I walk over and try to push the caragor. See! That wasn't so bad! Oh, I forgot we even had him! Let's take off after him. You should probably shoot him. Yeah. We're so terrible! Borg-Borg! Did we kill him? Does anybody have any lipstick? And some rouge? I thought we were going to make him pretty. I have some bagpipes. I like to play music sometimes, that's all. Five. What's that? Oh, we could take a bath! What's that? What happened to your neck? (high-pitched) Oh man! But I rolled so well on that first one! Ten. We're the Forcs! It's what you eat with! You kill him. Kill him so he doesn't light it, then we go into the poop. Is it a surprise attack? Oh no! You should hit them too because they're going to light it. Can you do that? Are there any rocks around? 12. I'm going to try to throw this little rock at one of them. 11! I'm used to bigger-sized rocks, is all. Just because they were so-- Wait, you have it. Try to hit it. We've got to get them before they light the brazier! You go in? Eww! That's really smart. I'm going to pick up the body of the guy that fell and try to throw him at the other guy. Yeah? I'm big. Eight. I want to try it again but this time, since I didn't throw him high enough, I'm going to spin around and try to lob him up. Yeah. (laughs) That's terrible! Seven! He's not feeling very good. How big is the shrak hole? Can all of us fit in there? Well, go in, Skak. Doesn't hit me. I'm telling Borg to go through before me. Go on. All right. I'm going to gingerly lower myself into the shrak and then go under slowly. (whispering) Mozuu! Mozuu! I scream out, No! And run forward and try to tackle him. Manswine! (laughter) Oh shrak, oh shrak, oh shrak! 18. I'm going to-- I was trying to push him off of Mozuu. 20! (shouting) Death! (laughter) Okay! I want to keep attacking him! I don't know which dice to use though. Okay! 26! (shouting) Man-filth! 14! We're all going to die! (laughter) That hits me. Ugh. That also hits. Oh my god. You get to attack him? That's awesome! What are you at right now? I got a lot of shrak falling off me right now. I dodge it. It's all the shrak on me, it slips off. Unbreakable! I run over and I try to hit him! Oh no! That's 11! You're tricky, you! I try to hit him again! Oh no! That's only 11, again! I don't even know what you mean. Oh no! I'm going to use my troll's endurance! And I'm going to take that down by ten. Oh no. 21! I'm a boss fight, pig-skin! (laughter) Seven points. Do I still have a hold of his blade? Oh, yeah. Can I try to smack it with himself and say stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself! A 14. All right, then I'm going to try to attack him then. That is a 20! Seven plus five is 12. And as my bonus action, I'm going to take my second wind. I'm going to take 1d10 and add five to it. So 14 points of damage added back! Oh, that hits me! Oh no! Yeah, you're real sorry. Chosen. Oh, no. Athletics. Oh no, he gets me. 12. Attack Mozuu! Can I grab a hold of Mozuu and rip him off me and then hit the gravewalker with him? 13. Just my strength modifier? 18. He's not a two-handed weapon? So that's ten. You're unconscious? Oh no! It hits me. Oh god. It gets me. Oh no! I'm unconscious! I'm going to try and resist it. Oh shit! 19. I didn't get turnt! And it was worth it! Shrak is flinging everywhere. That was awesome! I died! That was so fun!
