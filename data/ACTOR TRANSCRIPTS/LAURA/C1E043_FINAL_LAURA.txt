On the main gaming stage. And in case you forget, you can always follow Critical Role on Twitter, @criticalrole, and the panels will be posted there, I mean, the schedule, so you guys can find us. Or follow any of us for our individual signing. Hundreds of twos, of threes. A very limited run. It's very, very limited, signed by the cast, so those are-- I don't even know how many, but once they're gone, they're gone, so yeah, those will be available for a short amount of time. Buy it right now! Sam, you look different tonight. Potentially soon. We're working on it. There's some really cool stuff coming. Really cool stuff. They hold dice, they are magnetic, so they stay closed, they hold your dice so well-- oh-- Thank you. What a dick. Not Thorbir, he's great. I don't know, I'm just asking you guys. We need to find Lady Kima. She's at the Temple of Bahamut? We also need-- oh. We also need supplies. We need lots of potions, health potions. They sell health potions here. Yeah. Yeah, they sell them here. That's right. Oh, that merchant might be here still. We have so many things to catch up on. We're just waiting for Vanessa and Zahra to get back from their hunt. Am I right? No, you didn't. She's quite wonderful. She's actually related to-- well, Percy, you would know. Yes, our friend. From previously. All right, all right, all right, all right. Let's go really fast. There's dragons in the world, we don't have time to shop. Well, not a ton. We have a lot of Pop-Tarts, but not very many gold pieces. I have enough in the party funds to buy some healing potions, so I think-- Yes, it is. Welcome back. Good to see you. How are things? KASH-aw. Like cash. I like it. This is the guy? What? (laughs) You called me over to push me. I am Vex. He's my twin brother. She does that. He doesn't realize that you bet against him. We've heard so many things about you, Kash. Sorry. Why don't we ask you, then? Vanessa, I have a question. Do you ever hunt creatures just because they're evil and they're killing people? What if lots of people are dying and you might be at risk as well? Okay. Okay, so. Vasselheim is unaware of what's going on, but a lot of cities have been destroyed. Multiple cities. Emon was the first one hit. Well, it's still there technically, just crumbled. So much. He escaped. He'd been trapped in the fire plane, and-- Yes. Which is very strange. Red, white, green, black, blue was one of them at a time. There's four of them. There's four of them. Yes, and we plan on it, but we know that the Slayer's Take is full of very strong, very qualified fighters and we were hoping to have you at our side as well. A metallic dragon. Okay. How do we talk to her? Yes. No, they don't. Isn't that like that rakshasa you were talking about? Well. Your help, potentially. The world is under attack. Is there anything that you know of that could help us defeat these ancient beings? Do you know of any one in particular? That's convenient. Much hidden knowledge? Does he serve your same god? Or another? All right. One small question, Osysa, I'm sorry. You serve the goddess of knowledge, of openness. Does that mean you would know anything of the god of secrets Vecna? I apologize. Very close to here, actually. Would you know of a way to rid ourselves of his weapon, of his tool? Right now? What's east of Westruun? Who has the map? At least. We should leave the temple. She told us where he is, and we have to find him. I thought we were finding the stuff that's hidden while we're finding him. I hate to thay this-- So, these Vestiges are ancient, right? Spread across the land. Wasn't Tiberius looking for a bunch of objects of magic that his people had sent him to find? Perhaps that's the reason Draconia was hit. Maybe they were trying to hide these items. Vasselheim. Whitestone. Potentially Syngorn, even though it's hidden. It's a lot to do. How many is that, Grog? By Westruun. We need to find Kima, we need to go to the Temple of Bahamut. Talk to people that are capable of helping us. Hey, does the Slayer's Take have potions we can just have? Don't they have like a supply room? Oh good, yes. But we will be. Think about the giant amount of claws and teeth and eyeballs and leather wings and scales. We're going to be so fucking rich. Oh, how about 12? No, I could have gotten something really badass if I had rolled better. Oh good, two potions! Vanessa-- In quite a while-- Grog. You don't have any potions left? Who doesn't have any potions? You get the greater one. You get one, and you get one. Thank you, Vanessa. Mm, we're going to bring you so many scales. You just wait. Wait, oh, wait! One thing. I know we're going. Is Lyra around? Anywhere? At the place where he is. Cool. Thank you. I can read your fucking lips. We're so nice! Potions first. Can I pull him aside as we're walking there? And ask, so, I thought you were interested in Keyleth. Am I wrong? I mean, you're interested in Keyleth. Right? I mean, I know you don't want to tell me. I know you don't tell me anything like this, but-- is it weird that he's here? Okay. Should I take him out? Because I can. Destroy him. Yes, yes, yes, Keyleth is so! Fucking! Beautiful! I get it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fresh fish! You! I push Grog out of the way. You. You sneaky mother-- Is he the one? Is he the one haggled with you? The one you traded all of our--? He's a cart-- he's a stupid cart salesman. Keyleth, Hold Person or something to shut him up! We don't have anything. I don't even want to deal with this dick now! Darling. You're lucky I don't-- Trinket? Have you seen my pet bear? Quite adorable. He loves potion salesmen. (laughs) No pressure now-- Look, I'm willing to trade you some very powerful magical items for some schmeasley little potions that heal people. I want them all. How much? Oh! Do you not see these-- These amazing-- I like you more and more, Kashaw, every time you speak. I'm sorry, how much? Right. How about, instead of that, I trade you-- Thank you, Grog. These magical items. And I pull out the knickknacks that I took from I don't fucking know where. It's knickknacks. But they're magic. Well, I know, but where else are we going to find a vendor--? I know, and they're quite valuable. But he said six thousand, six hundred and (mumbles) and we know this will cover that. (worried sigh) Now I'm doubting-- No, you know what, maybe I shouldn't trade these. What is the assist? 27. I'll put one of them down so you can look. Aw, man. All the time, Keyleth! I take my hand away, trembling, like I don't want to give it up. Oh. Knickknacks is probably the components. What is happening right now?! Don't you fucking fail at this. Natural 20. Just one of them. Are you asking me as Matt? You literally said I gathered up a bunch of knickknacks worth 750 gold. No, no, no, literally shitty-ass knickknacks. Darling. I snatch it away and say, do you have any idea how much these are worth? I know when somebody's trying to swindle me, darling. Tell you what. Take two thousand off your asking price and we have a deal. Two thousand gold off the asking price. Looking for guards. Fifteen hundred off the asking price. Yes. Five thousand gold. Oh dear. I'm afraid I've already Hunter's Marked you. Oh, right, of course, let me count up this little amount right here. No, that's all right, dear. Five thousand gold. Oh, and here, these very valuable-- Wait, what potions did we just take? You said there was two superior. That's a good amount. Yeah, it's a lot. Okay, cool. You guys-- I'm sorry, but we make a pretty good team. I cast Cure Wounds on Grog. Yeah? He did say two superior. I knew he said two superior! Matt! I chase after him. Yeah. Actually, dear. Dear? I believe you left one of your potions off the table. But you said you had two superior and you said all the potions for the amount we said. Are you going back on your word? Eh. Superior's a superior. No, it's all right. I know they're expensive. And we've already taken enough advantage. No! Can I sniff and make sure it's actually a real potion that he gave us? Did he give us fucking fake potions? Is it like watered-down gasoline? 23. Fine. Okay. You're right, you're right, you're right. I thought we have a good map of the world. All right. I have the potions. I already gave you a greater. I give-- wait, how many people are there? Eight of us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll give you two normies. And everybody else gets a normie as well. Who's our weakest? Yeah, you're pretty weak. Take a greater, Scanlan. Grog, do you want the other greater? Yeah, take the other greater. And then I have one superior. How many hit points does a superior heal? That's not that many. It's 5,000 gold? What a waste. Black powder. I'm going with Percy. Go get a drink. Don't start any fights, we have a dragon to kill. Yes? Yes, of course. A walking coat rack, that's what Trinket is. I'm going to stand out here. Percival? Yes? That much? (singsong) I love you! H-hi. I give the money to Percy to give to him. Tell you what, Victor. I don't think you want to tell her anything. Wait, wait, wait. 12. Okay. Keep it safe, dear. That was amazing. Does she not drink very much? I go and I sit next to Kashaw. A toast? We're toasting? At a time like this? Well, we do have some very inebriated-- I'm not drunk. What? There are dragons in the world, right now! And we're fighting? We're going to watch a fight? Don't hug him, Keyleth. I run up behind Grog. Are you guys all right, then? Everything's fine? All right, I'm going to go, grab a drink. I walked out and they were making out. Mugging down in the alleyway. I sit down next to the other side of Kash, in between him and Keyleth. How about, Keyleth, not another drink. How about you have some water, dear. Your eyes are two different colors, which is very interesting. Keyleth. Maybe you should go see what's happening? Go, maybe you should go see what is going on with my brother? Maybe you should go find out what's happening with my brother. He's stuck in a closet. Keyleth. She's talking about you kissing Kash. Wasn't he your first kiss? Isn't that so wonderful? I'll give you a helpful hint. If you're interested in someone, make sure they know. And if you're not, then stop fucking dragging them along, because it's not fair. Sure. You're dragging Kash along. Mmm. Is he really, truly stuck in a closet? Right now? (laughing) I go, I walk away. What are you doing? Stop it. Are we sober yet? Can we go find Kima? I might have heard what some people are going to be dressing up as and I'm very excited about it. Yeah. I don't know. Should we go to the Platinum Sanctuary? Where Kima is, right? Oh, should we wait until some people are more sober? Walking will help. The Platinum Sanctuary. Yes. Lady Kima. What's the pattern look like? We never got that stuff back. Yeah. You can, actually. Well, we hope that you can, as it concerns dragon matters. We know that you serve Bahamut, the great, the wonderful, the very metallic. These very terrible colored-- chromatic red, green, lots of different dragons, they've attacked-- Straight-up nemesis? All of us or just--? 20! 12. Eugh. So, if it's not the nemesis, the big nemesis, then you guys could probably take out these dragons, like, no problem, since they're not the Big Bads, they're just really bad. Wow, then I guess everybody in the world can just move here. He's saying something. What sort of aid can you offer, then? Fuck yeah! Kima! What sort of books? Fairy books? Cobalt Reserve is gone. The dragons took it out. Do you remember the description of any of the items from your stories? We should probably have asked-- Sorry. One moment please. Maybe not all of the Reserve was destroyed. Maybe they have secret rooms underground, where they keep the most ancient texts. We should at least check. Allura was on her way there. Isn't it very strange for dragons to pledge their allegiance to any other dragon? Then why are they serving the red one? Thordak. He's ancient. He was in the Fire Realm-- the Fire Plane and broke free. And now he has other dragons serving him. Perhaps any flying carpets that you have lying around? Thank you for the vote of confidence. Yes, unless you have any amulets or magical things lying around? So no on the magic items? Of protection? Cool. Zahra. Kima. Emon's gone, Kima. We should definitely go there. We need to look at the Cobalt Reserve as well. We need to meet up with Allura, though. She was-- (sighs). That's a good question. Yes, but that's in Westruun. Not necessarily, I mean yes, it's fucked up. That's down by Westruun. It is? But there's trees. And Grog wants to talk to-- Yeah. So let's go to the Earthbreaker. Off of his body? Ooh. Huzzah, I say, my Lord. Are they talking at all or are they all super-quiet? What's the test? Look at the coolness that's been created on this map! So cool! This is awesome, Matt! Hey you guys, don't die! He's really strong. Ohh. Yeah. (laughs) That's almost as good as all those other things you did today. Are you still face-down in the sand? Oh man! He gets four actions? No, he didn't. Do whatever you want, I dunno. You could've used your inspiration. Like, pukey or like the other one? Oh man. That's so embarrassing. That's 28. Times two. Yeah. Does that work on saves? He's not shitting himself anymore. You need to do that more, that's pretty good. Oh no, Scanlan! Oh no. He's so fucking cool. (whispers) Heal him. No. We should leave. Sorry, we'll leave. He did, actually. We should go. Kord? Groon? Or to the god that is-- Hey, come see us in Portland. Come say hi. It looks like the posters are gone, but there's still some signed ones left if you want.
