Critmas! Say it right. It's the holiday season. Oh no. Did we really send a courier? Is this where we start opening things? What are we doing? I want Marisha to put some nail wraps on me. God damn it, Glenn. What I like about you, Brian, is that the first time you came-- well, I guess it wasn't the first time. The first time you came to set after you got this job? You made us all Old Fashioneds during Critical Role. You make a mean Old Fashioned, and I wish that kept going. She did a good job. I mean, it's a little-- You definitely shouldn't do that. You shouldn't be hitting on girls at bars. It didn't go at all how I expected. I thought so, too. Is this bear pelt?! Let's open presents. I got some on the end. Where's the presents? This is for Critical Role. This is just-- What is it? It's a circle. Bigby's Hand, they are all made out of paper. No, it's straight-up paper. Those are awesome. I've got something from... There's no name! Travis. Me. Liam. Marisha. And Sam. And Matt, and the rest of the cast. Sorry, Taliesin. How did you know? Oh, the arrows! That is awesome. He is, it's like if he got awakened. Thank you, James! Sorry about that. All right. TRAVIS, LAURA and She's Ryuti76 in the chat. Ryuti76 in chat. Oh, because she made them! This is so cool! She did her thesis on Critical Role. No, she graduated with a BFA in graphic design, dude. Yeah! Thank you. She says she's sorry if they aren't the appropriate sizes. She wanted them to be a surprise so she had to guess. Is it me? Is it me? That is so sweet! Thank you, Rebecca. These are a good size. Thank you! What? Oh wow, look at all these things over here! What is this? I'm going to put Ashley's on the tree. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh! Hold on, hold on. Can I just open these chocolates, though? I know, this music is really messed up right now. Oh my god! I wanted to open the chocolates-- I thought they were for all of us, but it's just to me. "Dear Laura. Last year, when Matt read that I like the dark chocolate truffles with Baileys filling, yours and Marisha's eyes indicated your interest. Therefore I address this box to you to share with the entire cast and crew." (laughter) "I tried to donate to each person's individual charity over the course of the year." That's wonderful. It's from Paul Nelson, and he's claiming to be the official Critical Role forensic consultant. I don't know why, but he is. Thanks, Paul Nelson! They're soft, Marisha! Ooh, I want these ones! I feel like these are good for Ashley. Who's opening next? Oh my-- (exclamations of awe) You got it. You got it, BFF. Whatever you need. I like it even though she put Raishan on the freaking packaging! (gasps) Really? Oh, she does know! Never mind, she's the best. That was nice, baby. I see my name. Stop reading this letter. Donation! Can I open one? This is from Kristen Twammy? It is packets. This is for Grog. This is for Liam. This is for-- it's ink and a feather. What do you think, is this Matt? There's Pike. There's Percy. There's me. There's Scanlan. There's Marisha. So it is for Matt! Oh, it's all in English, too! Wait, there is a ton in here! Maybe you got oolong in that. Thank you so-- oh, wait, they sent another thing. What is this? This is pretty. Oh, it's a long letter. She's from Boston. What is this? She did photography of our characters. Look, Percy. Can you see that? It's a really cool photograph. Its got feathers and a braid there, that there. Oh, don't! They sent you mayonnaise. Ooh, that looks like Zahra. Oh no, it's like a ghoul Zahra. It's zombie Zahra. I want to put him on the tree, too! What are the things inside? They're the cutest! Yeah, that's a nice watch. I've got a wonderful little note from Alison Trace. She knitted a little superior healing potion. She said it's for Percy, but she said it could go to anybody who needs it. I don't know. I didn't open it. You do have a teeth collection, don't you? There's three chocolates left. You're on it, Sam, so obviously-- There's so many undone letters. Look at all these letters! Cool! I like to think that he's got Whisper and the dragon sword. I've got a lot of stuff from Valerie Thompson. She wrote, number one, a manuscript that she said Taliesin should read first, because you love to read. She made a bunch of bear paw stickers for me! And then she made a dragonscale pendant for each person because she's a dragonborn in her campaign. She's got a red one for Grog and a black one for Vax and a gold one for me and a brass one for Scanlan and a green for Keyleth, and the blue is for Percy-- yeah, it's a pendant! You got a platinum one, Matthew. And Ashley got a white one. They're pretty! They're clay pendants. She made them! We can make them into chokers! Is this empty? Who is it for? Who gets to have it? Because it looks like a whole lot of me and Grog. Baby, it's ours! Our quilt! This is going to be my TV-watching comfy throw. This is so amazing! This would've taken so long. I mean, look at these! These are the teeniest little stitches I've ever seen! Oh my god, did you get stamps? It never ends. This is a really cool thing. "Laura, my husband and 12-year-old daughter are crazy about Critical Role. They're now playing D&D every Sunday with a small group here in Reno, Nevada. We thought of you when my ten-year-old was selling items for a fundraiser at school, and we hope you enjoy 'Trinket's Peanut Butter Bears!'" What? How? And also, they made a donation to My Friend's Place, which is my charity that I love. Thank you Andrew and Grace and Ashley and Michelle! Thank you, all of you. Sorry. What are you doing? What did you do? What are you doing? Oh, that's true, we can't. Unless they want to be a sponsor. These are awesome! I like the colors! Put it in the fucking frame! Thank you! Give me these Peanut Butter Bears! I'm going to be in a mocap suit, so tomorrow with all this chocolate. I know. So this is from Justin Sharp, who sent a tweet to us a while ago. I don't know if you guys remember, but his daughter had just been diagnosed with cancer. She's going through chemo right now, but he wanted to thank us for giving him an uplifting thing to watch every week. He sent us all ribbons so we can support Chloe as she's going through chemo. "As she's going through treatments, I'm asking people to send her cards to keep her spirits up. I'm sure she'd appreciate it if you guys could spread the word." So we'll put her little PO box number here so Critters can send her some cards. Yeah. It's a PO box. No worries, guys. PO Box 392, Woodside, Delaware, 19980. So write some stuff to Chloe! Keep her spirits up! Team Chloe! The sparkly princess saving her own damn self. That's what it says. So that's awesome. Love you, Justin. Love you, Chloe. Was that all of it? Wait, there's this thing over here. What was that from? Why is there a piece of a GoPro--? Oh, and Matt, you have a letter over here. Oh, and there's another letter here! Did you already read this? This is from an Elle. Did you read this one already? We didn't open this. Okay. This is from @cxnnamonspxder, but there's Xs in the places of the Is. Anywho, she made us drawings, you guys! And she donated to the Nature Conservatory. Oh, I love that we're all in little Christmas gear! This is so cute! There's Ashley's. Look at this! I'm wearing a Trinket sweater. I accidentally did that to my brother. Fuck.
