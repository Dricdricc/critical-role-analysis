Are we allowed to say what we did in it? Oh, nice! I am in it. I play the Blade of Galadriel. I know! Get this, so I'm an assassin elf, right? She's really cool. The DLC is going to be about my character. No, it's the only one. It's the coolest thing! I don't think I ever told you this. When I saw the character design? She's a combo of Vex and Vax. No, seriously, though, she's an elf chick. So she's an assassin. She's got dual-wielding, and she wears feathery armor. It's so freaking cool! So basically, it's like if Vax was a girl, which is Vex. Of course, baby. Even at this very moment, as I said it, aftershocks. "Was I supposed to say that?" Ranger! This feels so weird to say after you mentioned that. Happy stuff! Which, by the way, you're wearing your Dalen's Closet shirt, Matt, and it matches your eyeballs so beautifully. Next time. There are Dalen's Closet shirts in the store. Go check them out. There's tank tops. They're really cool; they're cheaper because they are sleeveless. That's less material. Dagger, Dagger, Dagger; it's been re-released. We have the Scanlan tee; we have all the tees. And it's getting cooler now, so the hoodie is still in the store; the softest hoodie ever is there. Go check it out. We have hats and we have key chains and necklaces and pencils and aprons and tarot cards, and other stuff. And more stuff coming! So keep your eyes peeled. I want to watch it, but I don't want to watch it. It's so good! Did you already say about the physical copies, too? When those will be released? Give a high-five. I've got to get my passport. Oh my god. I'm doing that tomorrow! I'm going to write a note in my calendar. No, but seriously! If you want to, feel free. I'm writing an email to myself. Yeah, we did. We saw him. No, because you did a good job of killing that. We should keep moving upwards, I'm assuming? Well, yeah. But Percy, the belt? I think we maybe should do that, actually. But he was doing something? He was reading, or something. All right. Wait, we have light. Yeah, see? Pike's mace is lit up. We said that last time. Probably your hands are less noticeable than Pike's mace. So maybe we'll not have the mace on. That sounded just like her. Did you want this acid-resistant armor? You'd at least be resistant to acid. Yeah, Trinket is out. Brother. Make sure you stay within 60 feet of me. You said you're 20 fucking feet in front of me, I'm using my fucking earring to whisper to you. Stay within fucking 60 feet of me, all right? And the tunnel's rising steadily upwards? Do you want me to fly up there? Of course. Can you not use your wings? Well, then hop on. You don't know that! Do we have Pass Without a Trace on? Should I cast that on us? No, wait! I shouldn't because I got a proficiency, so we're both stealthy stealth. We're fine. So we're just going to go. I'm not casting it. But here's the thing. Everybody stay right at the bottom. We're going to fly up, but we're not going to fly up more than 60 feet away from them. And then come back down. All right. As long as everybody's within 60 feet of me. Because we're getting really close and I don't want Vecna to see us. I've got this ring. Ooh, that's good. 30. 30. What do you see? Well, get a fucking closer look. Yes, but quiet is the key word. I'm going to hover. Do we see any other openings? 20. Do I see any other-- Maybe we need to do this quickly. This doesn't seem like the most stable sort of tunnel. Hop on the broom, darling. In tempo. Grog? Can we pass under his legs or something? Rage quietly. At the same time? Acrobatics. 22. But you do extra damage because you're-- Yes! What do you see? We sneak under his legs again to like see what's going on. Oh, should we be on the broom? No, you should be off the broom because you might check for traps. I'll check for traps along the wall and ceiling. And he's going to check for traps-- Both of us or just him with advantage? Investigation? Natural fucking 20! We should go toward the cave in, don't you think? Does this seem like there's any traps that could be set off as we walk towards the--? I'll look at the sconces. I'll look at them better. You guys, there's no traps. We should head towards this darkened room. I follow up and stand next to him. Did you want to go in? Feel free. I think I was more stealthy than you a moment ago, so are you sure you want to be in front of me? And the brazier is complete dark? It's cold. This is not good. Maybe the mirror is a door. Should we try to walk through it? Hi, darling. I don't know why he didn't hear you. You used to be so good at that. Is the mirror leaning or is it on the wall? Can I reach down and touch the iron on the ground? The floor? Does it feel warm? Go see if you can walk through the mirror. We've done that before and we all exploded. No. What is it? (groans) Simon, go through the mirror. No, nobody's in the room. He's the only one in the room. What if we all have to push every button at the same time? No, nobody's in the room. No! Coming up from behind us? Can't you call to him? When you go pick him up and put him back on your fucking waist. How about that unseen servant? What about the brazier? Is it cold? Does it look like it's hot? There's no other room, it's a mirror. Oh, Keyleth, that's our reflection. What do your gnomish eyes see, Scanlan? What is the symbol of? You should go in there, see if you can disengage the trap. Can you do that? I want to go look at where the symbol is and see if it's a fucking button. What did you do? I fly up on my broom and do it to the symbol up on the corner and go (blowing). We already figured it out! Yeah, to clear them out! I'm in the corner above Grog. Two lines? Shit. I thought it was going to be another-- The one clean spot left on it. Ooh! I'll go into the corner above Percy. There was a reflection there, too, right? (blows) I looked straight at the camera as I did it. It was really awkward. Is there one with three lines, or are there any more areas we saw a reflection? Okay, I'll blow above the door. We all walk around going (raspberries). What if these are numbers and the order you have to push the buttons? I know. One, two, four! Pike goes over and she helps you. "If you lift me up, I could see the ones above the door!" Oh, yeah! We know! That's the amount of times you have to push the button! Wait, I think we reversed it. I think me and Travis got it right. I hope we passed the test. Did we get it right? (victorious laughter) We'll copy it and you can see what the fuck is correct. No, this is wrong. I'm just going to draw it. (counting) Okay, so now we know the order to push the buttons and the amount of times to push the buttons. We step just outside the door again and let his invisible servant push buttons. Yeah but the buttons are on this side. The buttons are on the side of the mirror, so we could shoot arrows at them. Okay. Let's hit buttons. Let's do it! Let's get through this room. The reflection of that. So the upper left corner from where we're looking. We'll know if we push it again then we did it the wrong order. In the corner, bottom corner. Upper right-hand corner. Let's go in! Hey, we did it, guys. SAM and Is there any traps? So he rolled way better than me because I rolled a ten. Do we hear anything? Are you looking for traps as you go, brother? Do you want me to fly up and get some? We have to go up, right? Does it look like there's openings in the ceiling? Does it look like there's any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from? 23. No, that's what I was about to look for, too. Keep your voice down. Well, he's not going to be able to do that right now because I've got a fucking ring. Did I see any stairs? I'm going to cast Pass Without a fucking Trace. It's my last Pass Without a Trace, but I'm afraid-- What if we bring out an entire fucking city of undead dwarves upon us? Oh my god! Vax is going in with you. I want to kiss Percy before he goes. Don't die in this stupid temple. Right on, Scanlan. Sorry, Percy. Girls are going to look for stairs, the boys are going in the stupid temple. Fuck! My fucking ring! We can't split the party. He was really excited about it! Oh my god, he was so excited about it. We're stealthed, we're Pass Without a Traced. She Pass Without a Traced us. 39. Natural 20 for Pike! Oh wait, she gets disadvantage. So much good for one shitty-- We don't know that he rolled shittily. Do they look like they saw us? Towards that pulsing light. We don't want to make too much noise. I'm going to shoot a couple. There's only eight of them. We can take eight undead. I take two of them by surprise. That's auto-crit. Yeah, they're super-silent arrows. So it's auto-crit? Well great, that's great. 20? Okay. Oh, the other one super-duper hits. It's a 19 plus 14. I'll see how the first arrow hits? 14. Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark. Whatever. 14, 15, 16. Two lightning damage. Do I add anything? Sneak attack! How do we D&D? Plus ten sneak attack. I hit another one. 14 plus four lightning damage. And that is plus eight. Oh. Sorry, I did sneak attack on the second arrow. Okay. I did eight damage too much. Okay. No, I think we should save. Don't shoot, Percy. Pike can use her mace on anything left in that area. Is the glowy window within 60 feet? Yes, we do. She cast it. You're like, "Gladly!" What about Pike? Because she just knelt down. She didn't really fight. My natural 20 for Pike, wasted! 30 for Pike. 29 for me. (whispering) Do we still have the thing? Do we have it in the Bag of Holding? What if we use it? What if we use it and it just repels them? Can we see in one of the windows? 34. Yeah, but making any kind of noise would draw large crowds. But first don't tell him to come right out, tell him to like walk a little bit to see if they follow the light. There might be. That crystal looks really appetizing, and I want it. It looks really super magical. Me. No, the blue crystal is right here. I don't know! No, you go get Simon 2 to go get the crystal. And then we all, within 60 feet of each other, fly up. Simon 2. I'll prime an arrow. A handkerchief to put over the light. He's holding a hanky. They will be staring at us. What if we destroy the crystal? I wonder if all the undead would die. Let's keep going. I'm going to get down and shoot. Just the ones following Simon! 25. No, 33. 24. I guess we have it. Bubble. Tight bubble. We'll try to avoid the clusters. Were there other buildings like that, ready to fall from the ceiling? 18. (shushes) Caw quietly. Are there any undead around us right now? Can we look at the gem for a second, since there's no undead around? Yeah. Can you do an arcana check on it? How big is it? Is it baseball-sized? We can't see anything around us? You should do that. Okay, I'm going to gaze into it super hard. So bright, y'all. I saw so many things. You know who had that? Our good friend, Tary. He was wonderful. Is it the same color as his Knuckles? I'm okay squishing it with the hammer. I think it's funny that we spent so much time getting it, and then we're going to destroy it. Let's get out of this dome. Is this investigation or perception? 23. So you could open them up? Are they trapped? I'll look to see if they're trapped. I rolled an 18. All right, then I'm going to try to jimmy open that lock. I already said it. Two! Wait. Yeah, that's straight-up strength, not a saving throw? Two! I'm really fucking weak. You'd think I'd be stronger pulling the bowstring, but no. Okay. I put my legs up on the wall and (grunts). It's a trash chute. We could fill the city with water. Drown all the zombies. Wow. Really? It was meant to move? I think I loosened it for you, Grog. Yeah, open the door! Shit! Let's try the other one. No, let's try the other door first. How big is the tunnel? So we can fit in? We brace ourselves on the wall to make sure we don't slide down. Pike. Yeah. I want to be in the front. Keep going up the slide or take the stairs? Does that sound familiar to us at all? Natural 20. We were stealthed. I'm aiming at the first one I saw. Has he seen the two coming down the stairway yet? I'll attack the first so he can take the second. These are auto-crits, though, because we are surprising them. Can I Hunter's Mark him? Oh, so we don't have to roll for attack? It's an auto-crit. 27. Second attack. Oh my god, 20. 20 on the second attack. I got a one on both. Thank god they were both at advantage. And they're all critical? Okay, so the first one is a crit. Solid! That's okay. 14, plus six lightning damage. Oh wait, you know what? Should I single out the lightning damage or say what all the damage is? So it's 12 lightning damage. Okay. Don't do that. I had already rolled that, but it was a six again, so 40, plus 12 lightning damage. On the first. I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage on that first guy. Add ten because of Hunter's Mark on the first one. Yes, I was all on one, unless he went down. Would I notice? Okay, then the second one. 21 on the second one. Can I shoot him again before he runs away? Sorry, guys. We did it. I wonder if we should have let them talk for a second. Oh, well. No, it's okay. I've got advantage. 23. Okay, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine around here, so he can lash up and try to catch that wizard, the cloaked guy that's running away. He has to roll a dexterity save above 15. So it snatches his ankle. Backwards. Then I'm going to shoot him twice. What is that? 32. 14, plus four lightning damage. I don't get sneak attack on this guy, though? Okay. 14, plus four lightning damage, and then I'm going to hit him again. That is also a 32. No, that's-- well, it's very high. 27? 28 12, plus six lightning damage. I am going to use my movement to stand behind this little pillar right here. (singing) The space between. It falls limp off of his body? Oh god! Oh my god, roll so well! Do you get advantage? Oh, the guy in red? The guy in red is controlling it! Say it again? Good to know. But the orb went through it? That hits. Forever? I have a dagger, but I don't even have it drawn. I have resistance to necrotic damage, by the way. Okay. No, he's behind her. Wasted all of our 20s on goods. It's a fucking wraith! Pike comes running up the steps. Sorry, Grog. That gives everybody advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and any time you're healed, you regain the maximum number of hit points. Wisdom and death saving throws. And full hit points when you get healed. Oh, great. Well, I've seen all the things explode. Fucking hell. I'm going to pull out my Vecna symbol, that necklace that we still had, and put it around my neck, because that fucking sphere is out and I don't know if it matters. Do I still have control of the vine? Okay. And it's on the other side of the force? So I'm going to use it and I'm going to try to grab a hold of the guy-- the guy in gray is holding the force wall, right? But it probably is a concentration. The guy in red is holding the sphere. The guy in red is holding the sphere. I'm going to try to knock him down and see if I can break his hold on the sphere, maybe? Is that stupid? That's a bonus action. I still get an action. And movement. Oh god. I'm going to spread out. I'm going to come over here, maybe? Or here. Oh jeez. I don't know. I can't hit anybody! I'm going to wait. I'm going to hold my action until I see something getting through that fucking force wall. So that I can attack him. Oh yeah. Stay within 60 feet. Oh my god, what if we fail these rolls? We're fucked. What was I holding for? I was holding until I could attack something, or until I could get through the wall? I think it was through the wall. 23! Pike definitely takes it. With her Mace of Disruption, she gets an extra 2d6 radiant damage. That's a 21 to hit. 27 for Pike. Is it a fiend or an undead? So it has to have a wisdom save of 15. Ooh, that's good. You did the six and the four. Radiant damage is the bomb! I can only do this as a bonus action so that she can have that up, right? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon. Should she do it at a second level? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon up near the wall as a giant sword that looks like it's on fire. No, near the wall, yeah. Up close to the wall so that she can attack as soon as that thing is down. And then she's going to hold her physical action until there's something that she can attack. Yeah, her mace. Oh, that's me! I'm Vex. I'm going to dart away from this ball as fast as I can, and I'm going to come up here. I broke through the wall. I can't reach. I'm too fucking-- It's fine; I got it. And I'm going to hold my fucking attack until something comes out that I can attack. Wait, I have bonus action still. Okay, I'm going to use that Grasping Vine that I still have up, and I'm going to re-grab onto that stupid guy's fucking neck and yank him towards the wall he's right in front of. 15. My spell DC may be higher. I don't know if I have increased that in a while. So my spell DC is 17. I wanted it around his neck, just to make him annoyed. Oh no! He's coming back for Scanlan! Oh my god, we're going against Gandalf right now, you guys. You can move five more feet. You've got more movement. Punch him back toward us. Bigby's Hand on the opposite side of him and punch him back toward us. Did we notice? Did we notice that the wall went down? I'm going to shoot at the dude in red in front of me. I'm going to sharpshooter him, the guy right in front of me. 22 to hit? 21 damage on the first. And then 19 on the second. That's also Sharpshooter. No, that's 19 to hit. 27 on the second. But he doesn't have control over it anymore. This guy in red is down, so all that's left is the guy and the wraiths? We killed him. That was the first guy we killed. Yeah, that was your turn. That's amazing! Pike gets to attack. Pike has been holding her action to attack as soon as she could, too. So 20 to hit on Pike. Where is my other d8? Here it is. (counting) So it's 22. Saving throw is 15. I know, right? Kill him! We can't do anything about that floating ball. Cover it with a handkerchief. But stay within 60 feet. Everybody gather up around me again. Avoid the ball. I'm going to rifle through the robes of red robe. Well, we can grab their robes, I don't know how many of those we have, but I think we also have a necklace. I'm going to take his robes. Yeah, the guy in the red was controlling it. It came out of the wall. Can we reach down and grab him away from it? I use my Grasping Vine and I yank him away from it. Scanlan, you're hideous now. You got to roll higher than a 19. Can you give yourself inspiration? Or Dominate that shit. I get ready with the vine to yank him away in case it starts moving toward him. Now inspire! Oh my god! You did it. What if we use the orb and go straight up? We don't even keep tunneling, we juat go straight up to the city. Yeah. Do you need us to heal you or anything? What do you think? Do you want to go up? So it forces them to speak the truth? Does it work on undead? So you could cast it, and then Pike could cast Speak with Dead, and it would come up into the Zone of Truth. But they have to answer the questions. Right? Let's do it! Find out how close we are to Vasselheim. No, but how close we are to Vasselheim? What's the plan of attack in Vasselheim? How big is his army? We get five questions, I think, with Speak with Dead. Where is Vecna within the city? Who's the death knight? Let's do it! Cast your Zone, yo! (singing) Autozone! I don't think so. Casts Speak with Dead. He had a different color. Yeah, red robe. Oh no! What did he do to Pike? And you said it was minus 36 damage? Pike got psychic damage from that dude. 31 points of psychic damage. Look for Shadow of War.
