It's just the first month. It's just $3 off the very first month. It's $3 just for writing a word. That's right. That's right. Already? Already? Oh my god! Ready to go to the actual castle? We're back from the Feywild. If he doesn't remember we went, does that mean I lose my title? Oh no! Baroness. Lady Vex'ahlia, Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone, Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt. I don't know anything about the Grey Hunt, but it's written down on a piece of paper you gave me, Percy. That I actually threw out because I fixed up my notes. So I don't have the piece of paper in this world binder. No, no, it's definitely right here. He did, and it's just, it's in my-- so I don't have it. I would still have it. It's just not in this particular not-in-that-world binder. Keeps it under her arm the whole time. It's got a happy kitten on it that says "hang in there." Life needs things to live? Grog. Oh, here. It's right here. Right here. That's your handwriting, don't you see it? Oh god. And Grog's just content sitting over here completely blank. But wait, are you just going to make up what he remembers? No! Lady Vex'ahlia. Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone and the Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt. Of the Third House of Whitestone. Of all the ten minutes to have him remember, maybe that's not the one to focus on. Make up something wonderful for him. He's wanted to go there his entire life. Make something magical. Oh no. You remember? Approved? Oh, Grog, it's really badass. You killed the guy that was holding it. You. Wait, is this normal? Would we have known that this is normal for people to lose their memory when they come out of the fucking Feywild? We wouldn't have learned any of that in our studies. No? (whispers) I was a studious child. I was a very studious child. He cheated off my tests all the time. I was incredibly studious. Grog, did this happen last time you went to the Feywild? When you-- do you remember-- okay. You killed so many things, Grog. You fought so many people. No. We need to find Pike. Pike came to help us. Five days? There's Gilmore, we could talk to him. Allura? Maybe she can help. I make sure Trinket's out of the necklace. Lots of diseases. Percy, your sketchbook. You made sketches the entire time. You used your lightning javelin. You-- Yes! You have a little statue. You have a little statue, Grog. It's black. Onyx means black. It's an onyx mastiff. It's an onyx statuette of mastiff. If you use an action to speak the command word-- I know. And throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you it becomes a living mastiff for up to six hours. It was etched on the bottom and I totally understand it. I do. It's right there. It's insta-dog. It fights. It has sight and hearing checks. It bites and it claws just like-- oh, no. It just bites. I'm looking, I'm looking. The creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to zero hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again for, ugh, seven days. Mastiff has an intelligence of eight (laughs) and can speak Common. It's smarter than you. Yeah. And objects within that range. Sorry, I didn't mean to read all that and make it not interesting. We know it. It's good doggie. You can say it in Common. He understands Common. Yeah, that's it. Grog, I'm sorry. How are things here? Cassandra might know. So you're leading an army? And what's your role in it? We have faith in you, Jarett. Yes. We were wondering what happened to him. Pardon our appearance. And stench. We're covered in that black messiness, I assume. Another Vestige. I would love for you to take a look at it, Shaun. Thank you. Did you bring any other survivors with you? Did you say Thordak's wife? Did I mishear you? Wife and guards is what I heard, and I was so fucking confused. You've done so much. She's the one that released Thordak, so that wouldn't surprise me. Draconia? Shit balls motherfucker. Gilmore, does the screen keep us hidden? I'm going outside, too. Wait! Skywrite? No, they don't! They don't necessarily. I wouldn't Skywrite anything right now, Keyleth. That screen could keep us hidden. He could be searching for us right now. Yes. 16. Send out the guards. No. Don't do it! I'll follow behind Grog. I pull out the broom and I get on the broom. It's not clear. We could just be in their way. People would just come out screaming. They won't know where to go. They don't see us, but they know we're nearby. We need to get everybody underground while we can. Spread the word. Tell everyone to get underground. Can we send people under the castle as well? Don't empty out the earth too much, or it won't support the city. Where's Gilmore? Gilmore. Good job. Where's Pike? I drop her, because I'm fucking weak. You did an amazing job with that. No, it was fine. He doesn't remember, Pike. I don't know. Maybe there's a way to cure it. Grog, that's not possible. No. I think it's gotten quite a bit away from us. No, he did! He still killed the big bad guy! Yeah, well, stoned. Can you only do that one time a day? Potentially. What? Oh, but they're so fun to look through! All right. Can we tell the people as they come out, I know you'll want to celebrate, but please keep it as quiet as possible tonight. We don't know when it could be back. Gilmore and Pike. Allura. He was like, who's Shaun? Can I fly up in the air while this conversation's going on? Not too high. No, I know, I want to go to the very top where I see the shimmer. Okay. But it's high enough, that I mean it's higher than the castle. Okay. The direction that the dragons went. Is this stupid? Can I shoot my Oracle Arrow in that direction? Why? It's an arrow! Oh well, I guess that's true. I thought it was a ten-minute, because it's Fenthras I thought it was a long-ass arrow. Oh! Wait, okay, so the Oracle Arrow, is it like you fire it, and then it shoots somewhere and it sticks there and I can see through it for ten minutes? That makes sense. I foresaw it just going, because I thought it was like a special kind of arrow. Right. Cool. Then I'm not going to use it. Because now I understand how it works. I've learned something. Can I cast Primeval Awareness and see if it's within six miles of us right now, still? Or if it's farther away from that. I want to see if they're just camping out around us or if they're going away. Yes. It's my favored enemy. Okay. They're further than six miles away. Okay. No, no, we don't have Whisper. Technically, the elves of Syngorn are building an army. However, who knows if they'll actually come through. In the Feywild. No. Our guards aren't in Syngorn. No. Oh we did? I was distracted. Yeah. We need to move everybody underground the same way we did in Emon. That's wonderful. That's smart. Yeah, they don't like us. That's true. Umbrasyl. Dead and gone. Yeah, and if not that, then the message left in there. The white one was more vain. Yeah, they like to make people suffer. Shut up! There's notes somewhere in here! Maybe the next one we can sign as somebody else. Have any what? Raishan saw us, the white one saw us, all of them saw us. Gilmore was scrying on them. It took three days for him to get here. That's how he knew. They struck during a political-- Somebody has to be telling them things. It could be Raishan taking the form of a human again, for all we know. Yes. How are the citizens? Did you get everyone in there? What are you doing? Oh, you're just hoping? First one was really good. About Jarett?! You're insighting Jarett? Get you a drink, I think. Yes. We need to talk about barricading underground. Making it more secure. We've got some fancy-ass bottles. Just one bottle between the two of you? We saw Thordak there, actually. Why do you ask, Grog? I bet that sounds something Pike would like. One is in Marquet? Good times. Yes you do. If you don't mind. Abyssal. That's where demons come from. That's the thing that killed Pike. Months and months. Whisper, right? We're so tired. We need to take it-- Just guessing? Wait, what? We can't move it. So they can't scry into the room, it cancels all magic. How long is the travel to Marquet? No, it's not about time. The dragon is sitting on top of Draconia. Unless we know how to take on that dragon, we can't save anyone. Seeker Asum is telling people that this city has been magicked away. We're just reiterating the things that you told us you were going to say. Plus it's really fun to say your name. There's definitely at least-- When you're scrying on a tree. Are we sneaky? You have your memories of the Feywild, do you remember sloshing around in that black sludge? Very loudly? It's on. I can't believe if we fight one that means we have to fight-- How are we going to do that, though? Oh, and how would you do it, Grog? Oh my god, Grog, he will never see through that! That's brilliant. Right? We know that? What if somebody can Polymorph into a little green dragon or something? Fuck shit up as a dragon and leave evidence behind as a green dragon. Or the green dragon. Vorugal is the white dragon? How do you know Vorugal doesn't know? Yeah, but the white dragon might have some way to communicate. They have other balls, right? It's very loud. We saw orbs in Umbrasyl's? That was in Brimscythe's. He shattered them. Fuck. So that we wouldn't be able to scry on anyone else. Or he was pissed! Yeah, he would deny it. Of course he would deny it. Even if he jumps to conclusions, he would be pissed. Would I know how fast dragons can actually fly? If it's a two-week trip to get to Draconia from where we are-- Okay. If they were flying, how fast could they get there, potentially? Check it out and get out before they get back. They've probably left a good amount of army there to keep people under control. We'd have to get in and out in a couple of hours. We don't have them. It would take them a few days to get there? Have you seen the lizard people? Okay. Wait, what? Really the only point of going there would be reconnaissance. That's it. No fighting. No. That sounds wonderful, but if we get people out, they're going to know something happened. Plus, if we're lizard people, the survivors aren't going to be wanting-- They're going to be afraid of us. So we wouldn't be able to bamf out. Oh fuck. Nope. This is danger zone. We can sleep and wake up in the morning and teleport there. We can't fucking go there when we haven't slept, Grog. We'll all die. They're so nice. Good plan, guys. Good plan. I wish you guys could see it up close. Obviously, we're going to send a picture on Twitter so you guys can see it, but it lights up different colors! It's got Elvish for "protector" and "growth." Did I say it right? Protector, not protection? Protector is right! Say what?! Thank you so much! You're unbelievable. Lean it up against the table. By the way, I got terrible sleep. I replayed everything Saundor said in my head a hundred times. I am terrible! Wisdom saving throw? 12. Baked beans. Tell me there's baked beans! It's terrifying. A rambling de Rolo. Vote, then? I've changed my mind. I want to go to Marquet now. Sorry. Oh shit! I didn't mean to fuck that up. Trinket, what's your vote? Yeah! What is what? What is it? Let it be known, I don't think we should go as lizard people anymore. I think we should go as ravaged Draconians. At least that way, they'll trust us. Pop in, scry, pop into Draconia, look around and next day, pop out. Can we do that? No, we're going to Draconia. How can we go there blindly if you don't know where a tree is? We would only scry on a tree. We wouldn't scry on a dragon. It'll still take a couple of hours to get there, though? It's 500 in the morning! Are you not scrying on a tree? That's what he just said! I've also got a Scrying Stone. Here. No. it's a Scrying Eye. You can use it once a day. I was going to bring it out! It was just sitting there. It's true. Maybe scry on Lockheed. At least you got one for free. Jutting out the side of-- Okay, I have an idea. What if we tie a rope on something on this side and we all go out of the rope really fast and drop down? They could potentially see us as soon as we come out of the tree. This is risky. You're the one that was most adamant about us going there. Why, Scanlan?! Okay, before we go through, I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us so we can stealth through the tree. Like that's going to work. I'm going to look for something very solid. Are there trees around us that we can go through right now? All right. I'm going to tie the rope off onto a very sturdy thing next to a tree that we're going to go through. Yes. Jump out! You saw rubble. But there's things that were crawling around amongst the dead. No! Because that's dumb. We're going to break our backs. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone right now because why the fuck not? Oh yeah, I'm on the broom. And he's on the broom. I fly through stealthily. I'm trying to get down to the ground quickly and hide behind something. 33. We get down on the ground and go under. And you're covered in wings. 25. 25. Can I whisper in Draconic? Lockheed! And whatever the word is for "Come to me." I pull out some of my food that I give to Trinket and try to feed it... I cast Speak With Animals. Is he an animal? I would have known, as a dragon expert, that he's not a fucking animal, then. Whatever. I didn't fall, I flew. Perch him on my shoulder and get out some more of the little boar meat we have in the bag of colding and feeding him. Can I speak Draconic to him, see if he understands any of that? Yeah, I know. I say "Where is Tiberius?" in Draconic. Where is home? All right. Stay. Could we tell what kind of creatures they are? Don't do red! Maybe it's good to make us silvers and whiteish! Gern didn't have a tail and he was less than-- I don't think Draconians will like us without a tail. Rags! Put us in rags, like we've been living in rubble. Make us look like we've been beat up. Oh shit, who all speaks Draconic here? Don't actually speak Japanese, Grog. Okay, I'm stealthily leading us. That direction, towards where the lair is? And for any of the lizard creatures coming towards us. Then let's quietly make our way that direction. Let's injuredly keep walking. Do we see any books that seem interesting as we're walking through them? That means Raishan was here. The people that are scouring through the rubble, are those dragonborn or just the lizard people? Can we look at their behavior and see what it looks like they're doing? 13. This isn't having to do with dragons? So it's 13. Friends. Friends of Stormwinds. I walk up injuredly. Pardon my friends, their tongues have been cut out by our captors. I'm all that's left. You know what, I don't know what to tell you. Everyone with a tail's an asshole. We got what was coming to us. 19? I can shoot. He makes boots. She's really good at stonecraft. Choice B. Oh, they're going to know, as soon as we're in chains. Oh, shall we drop Seeming? Perhaps we should drop Seeming? Wait. I have to tell you something. We're not actually Draconian. Well, we have some really good magic users with us. Look, forgive us for making tails. We don't know anything about your culture. We're idiots! We came here because we know you're under attack, and we're trying to help. Yep, because we're stupid! 14? Drop Seeming, just drop it. I know, I'm sorry! No, believe me, you don't want the tail. I repeat him. Here's the thing. You're being attacked by a white dragon. So you're happy with it? Right. But now that the Sky-walkers have already been torn down, do you want to keep the dragon in charge? So you serve one. And he doesn't punish you at all? He's a good master? Really bad. How can we help? That's what we're here for. Gladly. But not in chains. We do this freely. I'm sorry, that's not happening. That we will. Yeah, add that to the list. Our entire landscape is under attack. Now, Vorugal has helped you, but they've made many others suffer, not just Draconians. Entire cities brought down, for nothing. We're here to right the wrong and help in any way we can. Tooma. We knew that was going to happen. Who is Tooma? I explain everything that's happening in Common as we walk. Is everyone still cool with this? We're going to the chieftain. They actually said they wanted us to chop firewood, so if we can get sent on that mission, we're set. Are we in the mountains? No. Are we? We have to go. They're walking us to the chieftain. Can't just walk away now. Do they have tails? Nobody has tails down here. That would probably work at this point, right? Tooma. We apologize for coming in the guise of your enemies. Unfortunately, we don't know much about your culture, and no one ever informed us of what you have suffered, and we apologize. 23? Yes. Much deserved. They do that. I want nothing more for you than that. Let us help you. Much relieved. Yes, they do. We will do everything in our power to watch it die. It should be back very soon. Can I roll an insight check on her? 19. Well, we tried to do that one other time. While it did pay off, and its brother is dead, a lot of people died in the process. A lot. Very large, strong people. The risk here is that by destroying Vorugal-- We'll bring the wrath of the others upon you. Thordak is much larger, and I don't think he's been here. Lots of different places. As you can see, we're half-elves. Tooma. Are the Frigid Doom's armies around? Will they see us? We certainly don't want them to see ours. Can you cast Seeming again? Wait, if you cast Seeming, will we still be able to get into the-- He was the guy that we talked to right when we got here. Can I tell Tooma, as we walk out P.S., if that dragon comes back, we need to bolt. Thank you. We lost a day, but the dragon will still take the same amount of time. Do we see any big trees around here? Tooma, is Vorugal having you collect all of this? And when you can't find anything? What then? I got a natural 20 when I dropped it. Giving up on it. What is its nature? Is it vain? Does it want you to bow before it? Can I roll an insight check on her again? Jesus. This is creepy. 27. What are you guys talking about? Check for fucking traps before we go in there. Yeah, let's not do that today. This is reconnaissance. Can I stand on the top and look out from the platform and see what is visible from the platform and what areas seem hidden in the landscape? I don't even need to look. Good. Oh, this is pertaining to dragons! We're all looking. 16. They'll be able to scry on us for sure if we steal it. They see us. The minute we looked into Brimscythe's. Do you speak dragon? You have a great idea of how to kill it? And also, you're right in front of the scrying circle. We spoke to Tooma in Common. If we attack one dragon, we start the war. That is something we've been told over and over. Once one more is dead, they'll probably all attack. The greatest plan we have is what Grog came up with, which is pitting them against each other. We came here to find out what its lair looked like. In every aspect, Scanlan, disgusting. Don't! You didn't say that out loud. You did not just say that out loud. Can we just step away from the orb while we talk? Can we sketch what it looks like? I think you should sketch, Percy. Maybe Urukat would want to come and fight a dragon. What would we leave? I don't want them able to scry on us. I could leave trees, too. Tooma, just in case something happens and a big red dragon comes to pick a fight, everyone hide. Get out of the way. I think we got the information-- What kind of creatures do you offer to it for hunt? How will we be able to communicate with them, for them to let us know? Fucking shit balls, Scanlan. We don't do that. Yep. If you do that, he'll know something is different. We're about to get attacked. Back to Emon. He always loved them. Are any of the Ravenites around us, or are we alone? Is Lockheed still on my shoulder? I bring him down so he can say goodbye. I get Lockheed out of there. I don't want him to stay in. Do you want to come? In Draconic I say It's all right. I put my hand on Keyleth's shoulder. He loved you well, princess. Were you going to leave a tree? Outside of the ravine. Man. Thanks, Loot Crate.
