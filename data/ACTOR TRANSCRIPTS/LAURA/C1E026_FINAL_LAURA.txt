That's awesome! Yeah, it smells really bad, you guys. That's a good announcement. Oh. No. Percy was upset. Perhaps we should check on them? Or a ribbon. She wore a ribbon. We have to go see Uriel. Yeah, it really does. Yeah, from this angle you look amazing Grog. Oh, so it looks normal again? I like it! Yeah. Beautiful. Don't touch it. I'm going to go upstairs and see if our guest, Lillith, is all right. I don't want to disturb Percy just yet. Lillith? Are you with Percy? Lillith? I peek my head in. Damn it! Go and read it. She's so cute. I tell everyone that she's gone. Gone. Understandable. Percy has good reason to hate-smelt. He seems rather disturbed that the Briarwoods got away. I was a little bit preoccupied by watching him shoot a servant boy over and over and over again. What did he say? What did he say? It's a really good line. Did you ask him about it at all? What, do you think his Pepperbox is-- what? He did pee the bed when he was a kid. Well? Maybe we keep an eye on Percy. Percy's not the one who killed a poor old woman, though. Tiberius destroyed her. I shot her. I shot her in the back. Let's be honest. I didn't chainsaw her, but I did shoot her in the back as she was running away. I was aiming for her shoulder, if it makes any difference. She had a wand! Just beds! And temples. (laughs) What time is it? Do we need to be getting to Uriel? We should probably be getting to the palace. Oh good, you're back. Yes. Tiberius, the point of this is you killed an old woman last night, very brutally. Please maybe don't do that again. Yes, you were. Maybe not on sleeping people anymore. People who are actually attacking us. We're all on the up and up now, right? She was attacking us. It was an accident! Uriel's waiting for us. Keyleth, it wasn't intentional and everybody knows that. Actually, before we head towards Uriel, we probably should-- do we have any sort of proof that the Briarwoods actually did horrible things and it wasn't us attacking them? All right. Cool. Just making sure that we had something. Seeker Asum. Allura didn't see the fight. Plus, they were the Briarwoods' guards, anyway. He went away with the Briarwoods, I'm going to assume. Trinket's still here, though. 13. Here's the thing. Percy doesn't like them because they killed his family. They took over his home, after killing his family. He got away. He knows they're scary. We're trying to protect you. We tried to get your attention. I called for you immediately. As soon as we knew there was danger. Also, while you are inquiring about him, you might inquire about Seeker Asum. He was mind-controlled last night. Up until last night, he was himself. Trust us that now he is not. How long will your investigations take? Are we allowed to leave the city in that time? Weirdo! (laughter) Darling. Seriously. You have a two in persuasion? Oh wow. What happened? What does that mean? Does that mean Uriel's under their control? I don't understand. Do you think he was faking that he was healed, and maybe he wasn't? Is he bleeding out? What if he's dead? We're so screwed! Yeah, the guy that Percy shot the hand off of. Oh shit! I hope everything's okay. Can you go get her and bring her to the keep? I need to find out if this boy is all right. Saving the day. Again. But she was attacking us. They're going to do it! (laughs) We should have rolled low! Just tell us you're doing it, we won't resist it! What the shit? Doesn't even trust us to tell the truth. No, because it'll disappear the minute we kill her or something. They're vampires, I don't know what they do. Thank you, Allura. We say as we're walking back to the keep. Well, we're allowed to leave town. LIAM and Yeah! No! He said we're allowed to leave. We just can't look like we're fleeing, so we tell them where we're going. They can even fucking follow us. I don't care. Especially that beardy side, Grog. Endless errands. I walk with you. Well, they're right at our fucking keep. It's not like we're all headed in the same direction, anyway. I have one. Grog doesn't have one. He has notes on who is on duty. Hello! Who are you? Can I insight check to see if these guys are legit? It could be Lord and Lady Briarwood, for all I know! Hi. When did these birds start showing up? Keep your money. And how long of a ride is it? Is it walking distance? Oh, so real close! You can't actually; it's worth nothing. You will. We are in danger of being ostracized. We should really be nice to everybody right now. The Klauses. We are here to help people! We're here to help. I head straight to the jail. We know where a hole in one is. Grog went through it. He's hanging?! I go and get the keys, and I take him down from the manacles. Does he look like he's been bitten at all? Can I look at his neck? 20. Hey, there. Welcome back. You are being held, at the moment, for your own safety. Yeah. Well, you were captured. We're pretty sure the Briarwoods are going to be pissed as hell that you let the carriage get hit. We're just trying to protect you, really. Keyleth, do you need to step outside? Right now, everyone is at risk. The Briarwoods are bad people, you can attest to this, yes? Yes. Can you tell us everything you know about them? You did! We want to know if the Briarwoods-- Pretty much. They're vampires, right? I mean, they're vampires. I cast Cure Wounds on him. I know Cure Wounds, bitches! Level up! 11. Do I add anything to that? 14. If we keep you here, protected, would you be willing to tell your story to someone else? The emperor. The guards here. An army that could go and fight the Briarwoods. It's true. Far more comfortable. A little less safe. I'm going to put it out there. I think it is. And we will bring a bed down to you, make sure you're comfortable. I don't want you sleeping on the floor. That's terrible. All right. Are you all right? Give him time. So yeah, I'm going to lock it. I'm just going to lock your door. To make sure you're safe, make sure nobody can get in. The Briarwoods destroyed his family, as well. And a chamber pot, because come on! So that Percy can't get anything through there? I do want to go check out that bird creature at the farmhouse tonight. Get the crossbow guy that we like so much. The guy that's the captain of the guards. No, the guy. He's awesome and he's an archer, as well. Jarett. That's it! I'm staying down in the prison, just for the time being. I don't want to leave him alone with Percy. Oh! Pathetic! I'm still in the prison. Everybody else is out of the prison. I like Wall of Thorns. Oh. That's not the whole place, though. Yeah, they can see through illusions pretty darn well. Our very capable guards. Maybe Restoration? Can you cast little Restoration? She said she hated you. How did that feel? Oh! That's it. What if I leave Trinket in the prison with Jarett? Yeah, fire! Fire elemental! Ooh, water elemental! (gasps) Tiberius, remember that you-- I know. You do? I have a diamond of awesome. And a regular diamond, as well. I give her a diamond. This is a regular diamond. The awesome diamond is special. No! Don't do that! Diamonds are really expensive! Any diamonds! I think we should use the ruby. Because I have an eye for these things. What? He's going to go down in the prison with Jarett. I knock on Percy's door and say, Percy? Trinket's out here. If you need anything, you just come out and you pet him. Welcome. Aren't you sober yet? Can one of us polymorph into a giant cow? We hear you have a keen eye, Kyle. Do I see any cowbells on the ground? Hey, there's a cowbell, Scanlan. I like it! Should one of us maybe not be a cow? No, Keyleth is definitely a cow. No, I mean-- I didn't-- we didn't mean like that. You're very lovely. I'm going to lay in wait with an arrow. All the rest of you can be cows. How you going to put it? I'm just going to put it around your neck right now. That way we can ambush the bird. You are so cute, Scanlan. Let's go talk to some cows. I want to walk over to the cows with you. The one that's got horns. I'm just going to notch a bow to my bow, just to keep a lookout to the sky. Yeah, remember Dork? Dork the ox. (whistles) I'm letting you guys fucking know there's a thing in the sky. I Hunter's Mark it. As soon as it is. I thought we were just-- I immediately-- oh god! I shoot it. But I was notched already. 21. I'm going to shoot it through the Blazing Bowstring. 16. (counts quietly) 26. And then I'm going to shoot it again. That one definitely hits 26. 26 again. Is your Enhance Ability still active? From before? I've got Hunter's Mark on it, so I can track it. Come on, Scanlan! Wait! Was Seeming a concentration? Did it drop? Are we no longer cows? Oh my god, you're not a cow anymore! Can I fly down towards it? Is it flying away from us now? Should we still track it? It's still nighttime, right? We're all following it. Is the mountain range really far away? I can track it! Of course. Yes. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. No, it just makes us stealth easier. No, it's not concentration; it's an action. Oh wait. (laughs) I don't know if I can tell. Where does it say it? Oh, never mind! It's a concentration. Forget it! I don't know how these things work yet. Okay. He came to a stop a little bit ahead of us. Can we all try to stealth in? All right. Well, I'm going to try to stealth. Mountains are my favored terrain! Oh, I'll still fly. 28. Did we just find like a mama bird and baby birds? What are we going to do? Me go in? There's a giant fucking nest here! I get close to it. As close as I feel safe getting to it. This is so stupid. Do I get an advantage because we're in a mountain environment at all? Yes! 12. But she's killing the farmers' stuff. Maybe. And her babies? What? Where are you? Who are you? Who said that? Ditto. I try to perceive where it's coming from. Is it in front of us? To the side of us? Is it coming from where the bird seems to be? You still look like a cow eagle. A cow in a cloak. That's 31. No! It's just Barkskin! It's just defense! Can I come forward? All right. What about Vasselheim? Not in the city, but outside of it. There's plentiful forests, tons of giant creatures it could feed on. There's so many monsters out there, they don't hunt them all because there's too many. 21. Then as a natural 20, you know that's good for you. That's the best place you can go. You can see the wisdom in my persuasion. I go and put my hand on her back and cast Cure Wounds, because I got that spell now, yo! Don't bring up contracts, Keyleth. Maybe just don't even bring it up. It's just across the water. You could fly no problem over it. We could fly back pretty fast. Couldn't we? Yeah, we can just fly back. Can I see if there's any feathers dropped from the giant bird creature? Can I grab a few of them? Can I have a feather that he dropped? Because they're beautiful. You have to admit they're beautiful. Thank you. I pay them for their two cows. Being nice, man! How much are cows usually worth? Yes I have! I purchased Dork the ox. Shit! How much do your cows normally cost, darling? That's way more than I expected. 40 gold each to make up for the loss of your cows. Along with some other food, right? Look at us not fighting things. That's really beautiful. I'm glad we didn't fight it.
