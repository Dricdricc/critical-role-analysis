No! Yeah, that's what we think all the time. And really believable. I just want to look at it, but you said I had to show it. It's so pretty! Wait, we can show it? Are we going to show it? Did you just steal the comic book? Is it still there? Sweet. Yeah, level six! I walk around and crunch all of that frost. (crunching) I don't think so, no. Is it always full or it is always almost empty? You don't have to buy alcohol at all anymore? That's wonderful! How do you decide which alcohol is in it? What if you get sick of it? You can't empty it out. What if you want to try a different thing like-- Yeah. Maybe we shouldn't do that right before we go to the swamp where we're going to fight people. You can't really waste it. Maybe you should try. I find a stick. Open up! I don't want to hurt your throat, you know. But do you feel better though? Do you want me to stick something down your throat? We beat them, though. Is it normally ogres that ambush you? One more time? That was very believable, Caleb. I think I've ever seen. Does anybody else want to drive the cart today, or do you want me to keep driving it? Yeah. Not the slowest pace. A normal pace. I want to stand on the cart and stand up for the ride and look around. I'll put my hands on Molly's horns and-- Am I rolling twice? Nine! Because it's appropriate. I'll sit down, I've been standing for such a long time. Plus if we wait, it'll take a really long time for them to cross the road. Let's go! Go! We should stand up and ride it like a surfboard! Yeah! Did it break the wheel? We could climb to the other side of the cart and try to balance it so the wheel comes up. Oh no, is it fixable? Would we know? I have an axe. Yeah, and get all of our stuff off of the cart. But I have our giant lead safe in here. It's pretty heavy. (gasps) I have Mending! I have a Mending cantrip. I have that! You guys, I can mend things. Thanks for reminding me on that, Molly. Yeah, I can try it. Guys, I'm amazing! That would have been way more amazing if I'd remembered that I could do this. Let me try it on this other wheel, though. No, I think the army would see it. We should look like we're people that are peasants or something. No. We needed help because our family is in the swamp. I push the safe off the cart. I just bought it. It's in the bag. The good stuff's in my bag. Don't worry. Could you help us? We are headed to this swamp place. What does he look like? Load or loat? Max Load, got it. Thank you so much. How long have you been a soldier? Thank you so much for your help. Do you need any help? Thank you so much. Stay safe. Everybody be safe. Actually it was faster than I expected. Could I try Mending again and see if what they did made it to where I can fix it now? Oh, no I'm wise. 23. Wait, that's a lie, that was a save. 20. Traveler be with us. Ta-da. Thank you. Right? Yes. You see that, Caleb, that's almost as powerful as the shit that you do. Have you seen my lollipop? Don't make me Inflict Wounds on you, Nott. Yeah! And kind of painful, probably. Well, shit. You're not awake. This is why we should have taken that circus tent, man. Are there any caves nearby? I mean, we're kind of by a thing? Did you guys wake us up because of the storm, I'm assuming? What is he looking for? Oh, it's right there. We're pretty far away. Does that mean that guy was named after a whole city?! Does that means he owns a city? MATT, TRAVIS, and Oh, I thought that was his last name. I'll take the next watch because I don't mind the rain. Just regular plain old check? That's not bad. 19. Big one, did you see that? Shit! Storm! That's not that long of a walk, quarter mile. Ah, it's like a day at the beach! We should get some waxed canvas or something. There was a big one close by. It happened right before I went to sleep. Don't know. Really? So what kind of people--? So I should go? I'm going to go get some of it too! That's impossible. You can't make something like that! I fixed a wheel. I could do it because I can make a giant lollipop. I have lots of faith. Is it considered faith if you just really like somebody? TRAVIS and Oh. No. I want to ride on a horse today! Ugh, it's going to suck even more because of this storm. Hey, at least it's cold so there won't be a lot of bugs around. Normally, bugs are terrible in swamps, I hear. Right? Oh no, and if you start to lose hope, your horse sinks into the mud and it's gone forever. Oh, I thought there wouldn't be insects because it's cold! We're trying to find Febron Keyes. That sounds like it was talking, or did that sound like a bird? Should we call back? Maybe it's just a bird. Where's it coming from? What area? It's over there. Can we look, can we see? Can we see into the swamp? Natural one! Ow! I got a leaf-- No, I think it's a leaf. I use Mending on my eye. Fjord, will you look at my eye? I think there's something still in here. Fjord, get it. Wow! My hero. Thank you Oskar-- I mean Fjord! Yasha starts throwing up. But we're on horses. Was it a snake? I really want to see what it is. Oh, you don't have a bird, you have a cat. Some poor fish is going to try to eat that. Maybe we should call out and see if Febron is here. Maybe it's a call. But the safe house is in the swamp, it's not in Berleben, right? Maybe we can climb a tree! Are there any tall trees? Can I start climbing a tree? Sure. 21. It was a really good one if it hadn't been. Perception ten. I cast Guiding Bolt on the reptilian creature. It's 120 feet distance and you said that the bog is 100 feet away. It's a-- shit, sorry. Guiding Bolt! Plus seven. Okay, ah! 4d6, ah! Eight, ten, 13. Don't worry, we'll save you! There's a thing, and it's trapped and there's the reptile thing that's going to eat it! Over there. I point and I start climbing over and try to get to it. It's about 100 feet away. Don't worry. Guiding Bolt is an attack thing, so I have to roll to attack. Oh, no. Okay, it definitely hits. It's plus seven, 16, 23. Yay! I'm so glad we checked out what it was. Oh shit! Oh my god, look at all these trees. Oh no, it's really big. Look at that teeny little bird guy. What? Ah, shit! Our fate point. We have to focus on it in the morning. That's really smart. We'll just say we pass the coin. Let's hope nobody dies in this fight. Yes. 14. 14. I can go? Oh gosh. Okay! I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon! Oh, shit. That's right. It's a 60 foot range. How far can I get it? That's true. Oh, I guess I can run forward first before I do it. I'm going to run forward and try to get up on that tree. Okay. That's about as far as I can go? Wow. I'm going to stand on that log so I'm out of the swamp. MATT and Wait. I can't get it quite that far, can I? Hold on. Let me check one last thing before I definitely do that. Okay. I'll put it as close as I can to it. Yeah. That's my bonus action. For my action, I'm going to wait until it's close enough, and then I'm going to hit it. I'm holding my actual action to attack it. No, it's a bonus action. That's dumb. That was dumb on my part. I'm going to hold Sacred Flame to cast on him. Ooh, you could double dash! That was really close, though! He's within range of my radiant blast now, so I can attack him. Okay. The Sacred Flame is what I meant to say. Dexterity of 15. Oh wait. Do I get more because I'm level five now? "Spell damage increases when you "reach--" Oh 2d8, yes. Oh, good. Three whole damage, woo. I can mend the shit out of some wheels, though, bitches. No! Yeah, I was wondering why it was coming from the other direction. No! Oh no! What if it's a trap? We should have got to it sooner! Hey, man. I'm up here. I don't know. It's not a bird! No, it looked like a person, you guys! That's wonderful. Oh no. In gator. Okay. Oh, god! Can I climb up on this tree right in front of me? For my move, yeah. I was so afraid it was going to be a one. 16. Okay, good! I'm going to cast Blindness/Deafness at level three on both of the-- It's both. Blindness/Deafness. It's a con save. Either blinded or deafened. Okay, shit. Yeah, he's blind. He's got a disadvantage on his attack rolls? Is that what it is? That's good. Okay. Then I'm going to use my spiritual weapon to come up behind the other gator and smack him on the back! Okay. Someday, I'm going to know what I'm doing. No. Spiritual Weapon is just up. Oh, Blindness/Deafness? Blindness/Deafness is not concentration. Yeah, it's just a minute. Plus seven to hit. That's 23. Okie-dokie. That is eight damage. Was that the one that is-- Okay. Ooh, he did! Are goblins reptiles? Why don't you take off the damage you did and reroll as eights? Okay. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity as my action, and I'm going to pop my little person down right behind the other side of the gator that Yasha's fighting, yes. Then for my bonus action, I'm going to cast Healing Word on the little bird creature. That's six. My invoked Jester turns around and thumbs ups to it. That's all I can do. Nice, nice. Oh gosh, Nott. Acrobatics. Oh. But you still get advantage because you flanked! No! Oh, you get Uncanny Dodge again? No! Sharks, and bears. Oh no! So it's even. But he's the one that cast-- I have Revivify. I have lots of rings, do any of them have diamonds in them? How dare you! I thought if I had my symbol of the Traveler! I've never done this before. Do you have a diamond that's worth 300 gold? Don't die anyone, don't die. I thought I could bring you back. Why do I have that stupid spell prepared if I can't even use it? TRAVIS and Look at you. He literally marked them off. No, he totally came! He's good, he's a hero! Can I use my invoked Jester, my duplicate, to run over to Nott? She can move 30 feet. It wouldn't be encumbered because-- Wonderful, I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on you. At, you know-- At second level. We're about to get a rest, it seems stupid to-- oh, it's cocked. Five plus four. No. It would be plus four, plus four? No, it's 2d8 plus four. Okay yeah, nine. Can I jump down and walk over to the little bird creature? You guys! Ew! That's really foul. Don't worry! I can help you. Give me your hands. Oh! I lift it up out. 20. Right? Can you understand us? Oh my gosh! Do you live around here? What is your name? Maybe. Are you an adult or are you a kid? A kid. Close by? How did you get here? Maybe you should learn how to speak to him. Oh! Can you write? I pull out my journal. Oh, you're welcome so much! How old are you? What's your name? Kiri, you're four years old? That's so wonderful. They are. There's a big fight going on. Where is your family now? Oh no, no, no! Are your Momma & Dad okay? No? You don't know where they went? How did you get separated? We should keep an eye out. To make sure no more of those things come out. Oh no! (sadly) We've got to get him to his family. Oh, I don't know. Are you a-- Girl bird! Kiri! Oh no. How many sisters do you have? (quietly) Oh man. Where did you see the swamp people that you were talking about? Well, you're how old? She's got really good penmanship, so I don't think she's four like human four. Most four-year-olds can't write like that. Yeah. If she stays with us at least until tomorrow, maybe I can send a message to your family and let them know you are okay. Right. I have some pastries, too, if you like sweets. Are you going to throw-- I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on her before she does this. Eight. A natural 20 got two points of damage? Whoa, whoa! Should we cut open these giant gators and see what they have in their bellies? I take my axe and hit it in the belly! Ugh. Ten. Can I realize that this was-- Would I be able to tell from my medicine history that this is bird people? Like, could you tell from the bones it's a lot of bird people? Oh no! Can they talk to each other? Whoa. Should we tell her? There's three bodies. Were they big bones or little bones? Then they're really sad, and they will be happy that one of their children-- Yeah, no. We won't tell her that, I was afraid that it was her parents. But if we can let her parents know that she's okay, then at least-- Yeah, well. The Traveler's been teaching me some stuff and I was asking him the other night about how I could thank my mama and stuff like that. He taught me a little bit of how to send messages across distances. I don't know. I think if it's familiar enough, then I can send it. Maybe if she describes them, I could do it. I haven't ever tried it. I needed to send it to-- Oh, I have to prepare it. There were three other kids, you know? Blood all over my hands. Sure. Plus, in the morning I can send a message to your mom and dad. Right. We can gift you a horse, and then you can go find them. I'll carry this leather to the cart. Right. I love her, I love her. SAM and (cheers) I know, she really is. She's a baby bird. A blep. I love her so much! SAM and Let's put a cloak over her, so she looks a little less like a bird. But now you don't have a cloak on. I'll take off my cloak and put it on Nott. But it's a short cloak, it's a little one, don't worry. Yeah. No, that's okay. I'm actually really warm right now, I don't need anything. It's not 85 degrees, it's still cold here. I put it back on Caleb and tuck him into it. Kiri, where was the city you saw, the village of people? We should go in that direction. So we can locate Febron Keyes, yeah. We should probably look for an inn or something, right? We should look for the Keystone Pub! Is there anybody outside right now? Yeah. Excuse me? Lovely weather we're having, huh? Okay! I was wondering if you could point us towards an inn, or the Keystone Pub maybe? Thank you. Can you sleep there? Oh. I cast Mending on the fountain. Is the wagon doing okay in the-- Yeah, looking for the big tower thing. 22. Let's go up there! Should somebody stay with the cart, maybe? Because I feel like all of our awesome stuff that we just got will be taken. This leather that we took-- Kiri, stay behind me a little bit, okay? Don't make yourself obvious, all right? We need to protect you. We can't leave her in the cart! No! No! Don't! Do not let this little bird girl have booze. Hi! It's really cool. He's a little bit high right now. Can I look around at the few patrons that are in here and see if any of them fit the description of Febron Keyes? That was a shitty roll. Eight. Can I get up close to them and one by one? We heard amazing things about this area, and we thought we would check it out, because we're travelers. Yes, and we like to see different sorts of things, and this is really an interesting area. You know, not many cities have a lot of water in them like this. It's really cool-looking, though. Downstairs? Whoa, that could be so much fun! Is it submerged in water? That's a lot more than you originally made it sound like. Yeah, sure, why not? Is there someone who can keep our cart? Do you have a place we can keep our cart? Well, yeah. Keep it where? Where? Okay. No, I'll do it because I want to see the town. Sure. No, I can do it. Yeah. Where's the stable? Man! I was going to look at everyone in here! He's right here! No, we have to secure the safe house. Let's go wake him up! Just on his teeth. You're so intimidating, Caleb. Really, really-- Was it gators? Oh well, because we are really good at killing those. What if we paid you 100 coin? All right. We could do that. I just said "coin." I didn't make it clear which kind of coin. 100 copper? 100 silver, okay, 100 silver, you got it. That's one part of it taken care of! All right. Upon delivery to the place. No, it's not, it's really not. It's a nine! Don't be a dick to us. You already said you were scared of us bringing you back to The Gentleman. What are you going to do? And you sing us a song. On the stage. And? 12? Yeah! Does everyone want to chip in a little bit of gold? This is like sorting out a check at the end of a meal. 20 plus 20, 12, okay. No, I'm going to do 20 from me, too, so that's 72, and then one from Caleb, so 73, so-- All right. All right. Here's your gold. All of us pulled together. Now go sing your song! Wait, shake my hand because-- eww. It's really important to shake when you make a deal. And look me in the eye. Margaritaville! Wait, are we leaving in the morning? When are we doing this? In the morning. No! This is so cool! Are there two beds in the rooms, or is it just one bed? Time to snuggle up, Beau! Oh, Kiri's staying with us. And you and Caleb. Oh, shit. We need to take the cart to the stables. Oh, shit. Maybe we should have the guy take it. Or should we just leave it outside? I think that's a bad idea. Okay, yes, we'll have Dent take it to the stables. Can I insight check him and make sure he's going to be honest? A natural one. He's the most trustworthy guy I've ever met in my entire life. Yeah. Okay, here's a couple silver for you. Thank you. Yeah? Maximilian. I think he was saying something that cute guys sometimes say, those kind of things. Then later on in the book, you run into him again, and he remembers you. Then he takes off his helmet this time, and you see that he's got the most fabulous hair that blows in the wind. Captain Maximilian is probably like that. He probably had the hots for you, Beau. Well, no, probably not! Maybe it was Yasha! Yeah! Have you ever read Tusk Love, Kiri? You know what, maybe Kiri shouldn't read Tusk Love just yet. Kiri, how old are your parents? You don't know how old they are? How old are you compared to most people that are like you? I think that means she's pretty young. Yes, she does. Your voice is very low, Beau! You kind of do sound like that. Okay, I'm going to spend the evening telling Kiri basically the story of Tusk Love-- But she doesn't have to read it, I can leave out the really dirty bits. I tell her all about Oskar. It's the most beautiful love story you've ever heard in your entire life, basically. I draw pictures of it to illustrate what I'm talking about. Leave that shit on. Ew. I like this place. Smart! Oh yeah. We are?!
