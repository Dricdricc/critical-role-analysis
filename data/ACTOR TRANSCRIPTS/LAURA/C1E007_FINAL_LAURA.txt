We're following her, right? And she said she would lead the way to the vault? So fast! No, 22! (laughs) But they don't know where we are. What floor are we on now? Right, cool. Oh, right! So we could go back in the little storage room. And go up. Let's go in the storage room and go up. How dark is it in here? Is it like-- So potentially, brother, we could take them both out if you throw your knife and I do an arrow. (gasps) Maybe you can put yourself in a box and walk around. Why are you doing this? Everybody wait while my brother goes on a field trip. Oh. I've been invited on the field trip, guys! Just me! Who else can stealth? Do you wanna be something and pop in my pocket? (laughs) That sounded wrong. I should not go with you, I can't stealth for shit right now. (laughter) (whispers) Scanlan. My brother's calling for you. What did he do? That's 28 times two plus seven. Man, you can't control Kima! Can I sneak up to the corner at least, so I can be ready to attack those two bastards? I sit there and I kind of pet him as I look around the corner. We should go after her. 'Cause we're all gonna split up. Let's all go in that back way and see if we can stealth around. Oh, it was 17. Oh gosh. I thought he just got what I got. Crap. What do I add to it? Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, good. LIAM and I kinda clamp my hand over his mouth and tell him to shush. Oh crap. I turn around and notch my arrow for them. 17. Same target. He's right in front. That one hits too, that's 19. 22 with the two arrows. Nine and 13. Torture weapons. Go listen-- aw, she's still going that direction? She's-- you know what? I bet she's pretty noisy too! I need that one! Oh my goodness. No! (laughter) Oh! Gross! Yeah, that would be good! All I want to do is find the damn treasure room. Oh, they're up and looking for us. Oh no. (whispers) Get the sparkly thing. Can I ask him, I'm asking you what you see in there. What do you see in there? Is it sparkly? Where are they? The stairs are up in the storage room, man. That's where we just were. I mean, I'm so far away. I can try to get up there but-- Okay. I'll go around the back way then. With Trinket! I like walk by the door and see that happening (laughter) I can't see anything, can I, from where I am? Can I hop on Trinket's back and see if I can see higher? I don't know? I don't know. No, I don't have that. 21. And 23. Okay. I Hunter's Mark him. Okay. Okay. 13, uh, 12! (laughs) Math! Stay in school. Oh, good, one. It would've been so cool, though. Just do it, Keyleth! Oh, right. What-what! Yeah, sure, I like shiny things. We're all going. It's a big, happy room. (singsong) It's a trap. Oh, no, we don't have light. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Can we stealth? I mean, I guess we're all kind of-- All of us? Oh, crud. Oh, oh, oh! Oh, no, I don't get any advantage in this. Oh, crud. Me and Pike. Oh, no, what if he sucks our brains out? Oh my god, he's gonna die. Nobody. Nine. (Grog voice) I would like to rage. (laughter) Did it distract him enough that we lost our thingy? Five. What happened? We need to get out of this room, then. Grog, can you always put down the dust of tracelessness? And I think we should all go back-- we should go to the second floor. I think what we should do-- Everyone, I think what we should do is make our way back to the initial storage room we were in and go up that stairway, because that one's hidden. It's by a hidden entrance, people aren't gonna think about that one as much as main stairways. There's a lot more, you guys. I think we should go find the vault on the second floor. I think I should gather the group and try to make it back to the other storage room. Just to get us out of this area specifically. Is that cool? Use your earring. Do you guys have earrings? Okay, I come over there and see what the-- what just happened. Is the poison still in the air, or is it-- So I can see that guy? So should I notch an arrow and try to hit him? All right, I attack him, then! Shabang! Oh, dang it, I didn't do it. I meant to Hunter's Mark him and transfer it over, but that's okay, I didn't say it. That's 30. For the first. I did say shabang, and 16 for the second. Well, sort of. 15 and eight. Trinket! Oh no, I used two attacks. Dang it. No, no no, I'm gonna hold him there, 'cause he's already in the room. What's happening with that dude I-- are you doing all this while I just pin down-- Speak fast. Before I kill you. Can we all-- we go in the room and Trinket goes up next to him and, like, gets all up in his face? 15? Oh, I should've been so smart, but I wasn't. (laughter) Okay. Oh man. What did I get, seven? Oh no! That's okay. Is this like a turn thing or can I do something? I mean, can I quickly cast Protection from Poison on Trinket? Okay. I do that. And that cures it. Yes it does. Yay Trinket! That is threatening. We've got to kill this guy. Or talk to him at least. Yes! Are there any-- taking that in-- any healing potions or anything in here that we could use? Is this still considered the Underdark? Oh, cool! Oh, that's considered the-- aw, I could have been rolling twice for all these damn things! (sings) 25. Did I find any potions? Did I find anything? What is that? That's major. Oh good. Can we go to the bathroom before we do that? It's less than-- probably less than 15 of each size, less than that, probably. It was a small amount. And that includes the shipping, that's why the price is-- A very similar design, so yeah. No they're not. Second run, yeah! Just hashtag them critical role and we'll-- oh, but if you're selling them already, there's somebody that's making really cool t-shirts on Redbubble, but if you're making them there, like, we can't print them too, so, like, just submit them to us, and then we can-- Well, he's, well, as far as health goes-- There's-- I mean, there's the front entrance, there's that door over there, there's like two other stairways, but we should use this back one, by the back entrance. So we should potentially just leave this castle for now and go find K'varn, rest up-- I get it! Okay. Yeah. Right. Then let's-- We gotta go upstairs. Have some ale before we go out, Grog. This could potentially kill us all. Scanlan had a great idea, though. Should we talk about what Scanlan wants to do? -- all of us piled on Grog and Trinket and you as the bases, and we become this-- I like it. That's true, 'cause I've got range, so that makes sense. No, It could be poison, though. Tell it to us, Tiberius, what's the idea? Mostly, except for the mind flayers. And another big monster probably, they might have-- Oh no, that's K'varn. No, no, no, he's at the other one. Oh, or into that other thingie. Oh, that's going to be so cool. I think we should just go up the same staircase. There's too many of them. If we split up we could just all die. If he's the god, we just go in behind him as the god. Potentially all of us will be stealthed except for Tiberius, and you who is a scorpion, and you who's riding behind Tiberius. No, no, no stick together. Too big of a group of an army upstairs to split us up. That's not going to be us! The secret one, the one by-- in the storage room. Oh no, Grog fell over. Oh my gosh. Check for traps. Oh, so we stealth down the other hall, we try. Well, well, stealthing down that hallway. Can we check for traps, check for traps, I look, I'm perceiving. Oh, I get twice that, good. Oh, good, that was way better. Ten. Yay! But that's noisy, they'll come out. I think it's gonna be noisy, it's not a stealthy attack. The two of us get back by the other twin door, and get ready to bust into that entrance. Grog, don't do that. Not that far. Grog, come back, because if they see him-- Yeah you bust in and be a god. When you give it, we'll go in the other way. No, she already did it. It's three times louder than it normally would be. Yeah, there's a lot of them. (Grog voice) I would like to rage. Those thingies! Yeah we're going to try to stealth in and sneak attack them. Oh god. Oh god. I go in and stand at the walls next to the door. 32. Oh, great. 19. Unless we're all dead next week. In which case-- What color was the vial? That's me! I cast Hunter's Mark! Actually, I just transfer it, because the other one died. I transfer it to the king. And then I cast-- First I want to move Trinket over and-- oh no, I can only move Trinket. Okay, first I'm gonna cast Conjure Barrage. It's a 60-foot cone. So I want to see how many of them I can get. Can I angle it so I don't hit my buddies? All right, I'll hit them. I roll 3d8. That was on a corner. Oh good! 17. They roll a dexterity saving throw. Half as much, yeah. The total? Was 17. Plus a Hunter's Mark. Four. DC. What do you mean? Yes. It's 14. Oh, I did get a-- I didn't add my spell attack bonus! Should I have done that? Okay, cool. I'm sorry, Grog. Oh, I move Trinket in, and I want to-- If I can get him to illithid, I want to get Trinket close, like kind of behind the queen. No, no, I want to get him near. That way he can flank. All right. Wait, you're all the way over there. 16. Your turns are taking so long! Oh no, Tiberius fell off. 'Cause of the basilisk. Basilisk blood, we can fix it. She's smart, she's closing her eyes. Oh no. COMPUTER-GENERATED You get 1d8. Are you unconscious?! Oh, that's me. Every time! No, you're not. Okay, I'm gonna hail, I'm gonna-- hail of arr-- no, yeah, Hail of Thorns? At level three. At the queen and the illithid. So, I should've transferred my bonus action over to-- but I didn't, that's okay. That gives me-- I should've done this before, I'm an asshole, I'm sorry. That gives me 2d10. Yes. Yes! Natural 20! (cheering) Oh, awesome. Yeah, all of it doubles. Oh, so, 36-- To everything within five feet. Oh, right, yeah, I should've hit the mind flayer with that arrow. No, it would've still hit Grog. Okay. They have to make a dexterity saving throw. Yes! Second arrow. I'm gonna fire from my flaming bow. I've got one shot on that left. At her again. And that's a 28. And that's nine plus a ten, where's my ten? There they are. That's plus two. 11. Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit. He's still at like really high health, too. The king. Oh no. No, he's under her control. Oh my god. Oh god, we've got to get out. That's a retreat. See if you can get the curse out of Grog. Because if we've got to retreat, then-- Yeah, get the king. You may be able to kill him. He's on his last legs, probably. You can attack him with your sword. Do it anyway. He's at his last legs. It would be epic, Scanlan. I call Trinket back. Get him away from that lava. I run past, 'cause I can't-- can I see? Do I have an angle or is it being blocked by molten tornado? Can I run across behind it? Yeah. Is that magmous right now? Okay, then well, maybe I won't run in that direction. I run in the other direction and down-- yeah. So I can see. Okay. First attack is (sings) 20. No. 19. Yes! Okay. 14. Second attack is-- Second attack is (sings) 21! What's that? 12? Yeah. 12 damage. Oh, um. Hunter's Mark. Damn it. Bonus action! We've got to get out! Yeah, we all run out that-- Grog has the magic carpet. Grog had everything. Oh wait, no! Wait, didn't Clarota take Kima? Oh, so we're all fucking fine, let's just get out. Do I get to roll twice 'cause of terrain? 29. Hot hot hot hot hot. Oh, right! Is the thing not-- wasn't there-- She also had created a wall barrier. Can you cast it again? Oh no. 29. I send Trinket up, to like, pull him. Anticipation. Oh my god. Ew, get that away from me. That went so long, I'm sorry guys. I encourage massages. No!
