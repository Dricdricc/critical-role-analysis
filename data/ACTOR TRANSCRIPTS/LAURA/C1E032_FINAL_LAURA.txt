We missed you, Ashley. MARISHA and Goodness. Thanks, Taliesin. Yeah, we picked those ones out. He's done; he's out. Travis is creating his playlist right now. There are some affordable ones. There's definitely affordable options on there as well. It's not all pretty expensive. So you can see them? I'm so excited! I'm looking down at it right now. Grog looks good with a beard. Oh really? I can't see it. Oh, right. That's Ashley. What am I doing? Are you in it? I'm a straight-up hoarder in Fallout. I need screws! Because that's the only way you can upgrade your guns! Congratulations, you guys! It's up next week? Holy moly. Me, too. Oh no. Are we still running? Are we still running away? We're heading out of town. Are they right behind us? I'm still riding Trinket? Are the skeletons still behind us? Can we see them? Can I trail behind on Trinket and try to cast Conjure Barrage at the incoming skeletons? But all the villagers that aren't in armor are still in town. I was carrying you. You're on Trinket with me, aren't you? Can he carry both of us? I do want to trail back a little on Trinket and try to cast Conjure Barrage as we're running. Am I in front of her? Okay wait, not before I shoot my Conjure Barrage, because I said I wanted to fucking do it before you did that. (laughs) Don't fucking block my arrows. I think it's a 60-foot cone. It would be 15. Dexterity, yeah. I know, no problem. Okay. We've left the Sun Tree. The hand went down, the spell went away. Beyond the wall? Oh. Pike?! Hi! There are lots of skeletons! Can I have Trinket lift me? Stand up on his hind legs, and up against the wall so I can climb up? Yeah. I want to shoot Lightning Arrow down into the core of it that I can see, just a big group of them. Okay. 16? Okay. And then that's-- sorry, 2d8. I can't add. 4d8. There we go. 19. Yeah. Everything within ten feet. Aw, that looked like it was going to be awesome. 11. Into the group?! Don't jinx it. Don't jinx it. A 20 and then add your athletics. Oh! Oh my gosh. Yeah, he's rolling a gajillion times, Ashley. Oh, goodness. Yeah. I can't believe he's rolling this many times. Our jaws are just-- Oh my god. She rolled a natural 20. That is amazing. Of course you do. (laughs) He just put the cone down in a lower place. Bone chips. Oh, we're getting trapped. You still get sneak attack if you're in back of them. 1d2? There's no 1d2. Tee time. I was picturing tea; he probably meant golf. You're licking the mud off? 19. Should get out of here. That's a lot of giants to take on. I'm out of spells! We can't go to the Briarwoods now. I am out of spells. I can shoot an arrow. Yeah. I said Percy, you, me, and Vax go on one, and then these three go on another. Why are we splitting? This is the stupidest! Oh no! Oh, wow. This one is very, very rolly. What did you get for initiative, Ashley? Aw. Yeah. Whoa, he's huge! Grog is almost as big as him. Almost. Horrified. I'm riding Trinket. I'm riding Trinket. His face as he said it. Go Pike! How did we not have Pike with us this whole time? Oh, can you not see? You're far away. Yeah, you have advantage. No, that was better. Plus another ten for great weapon-- Without a head?! How can you even aim like that, Scanlan? Hear that, Scanlan? Friendship. Against it. Against it. Did you add it to anything? You're busy being in the lab. Per attack. This is the best. Oh, I've missed Pike so much. Yay! (quietly) Not tonight! He is! He's there! Wild, wild west. I Hunter's Mark him. That's a good question. It doesn't say. LAURA AND Okay, I Hunter's Mark him as soon as I can. I'm just going to rush in. I've got to retire this one for a while. Did I already Hunter's Mark him now? I leap off Trinket as we get close. "I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention. 26." Oh no! Ten. I say, brother. You remember that giant a few years back? You're up. And I shoot two arrows for my two attacks. One into his thigh and one into his breast, right here. I don't know which ones to go with! They both hit. They're both 24s. All right. That's so crazy! Yeah. Plus 14 is... 26? 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, plus Hunter's Mark for both. 33, 37 points of damage. Wait, the whole arrow goes in? I wanted to leave some of it out. 21. Oh, that's saving throw. Wait. Wait, yeah! Oh, damn it. 17. Sorry. Ever? I think it's just you. What is he doing? What's happening over there? It's night. He's in black. You're going to just take it? But you also had to touch his axe. You can pull him towards the ground, can't you? Plus 2d8 for your fire damage. Okay. I'm going to shoot him two times through my Blazing Bowstring, which I still have one left of. Yeah. That hits. Second one hits, too. Okay! What's the Blazing Bowstring, again? 1d10, okay. I know. I do have a lot of little papers. Six plus seven is 13, 14, 15, plus fire damage. 21, plus Hunter's Mark. 22 for the first hit. Oh, that feels so good. As he's bent over, I want to-- I know! I'm wearing the shirt! As he's bent over and I just saw my brother attack him with fire, I hit him with fire again, straight through the eyeball that's remaining, through the back of his head. (pants) I run up with Trinket to the guards. I walk through and bust through their hands. I want to talk to the guards. I put my hand on one of their shoulders and say, you showed great bravery here. Now we rest up. You heal, and you get ready to attack tomorrow. Dawn. Hopefully, it's a while until dawn. Oh, good. We've got time! That's good. You're going to go get the dagger? That ornamental dagger? All right, go get it. (laughter) It's ornamental. He doesn't know! We should head west. I take the little bit of Dust of Tracelessness that we had taken from Grog and I try to sprinkle it on our tracks as we go and cover up our tracks. Well then, I use my ranger skills to try to make it look like our tracks are hidden. I love you, Pike! [break] We need to hide. Totally did. Pike, maybe you could help him. Damn, Sarenrae is really freaking powerful. Us, too. Should we find a place to hide first? He's rubbing his eyes a lot. Pike, he has black smoke coming out of his body all the time. Yeah, well, you choose to do that. Outside of the city. Stealthing. I don't. Ooh. 20. Pike, what did you roll for stealth? She's an apparition! Clang! (whispering) Survival checks? Oh! I have advantage. Really? Did that just happen? I've got to retire it. It's so beautiful, and I keep trying it. It's just been punishing me, as of late. Ten. Can I start taking a look around and see if I see anything? That's way better than mine. 17. Well, what happened here? Does it look like a cave-in, like somebody did it on purpose? Does it seem like there's cobwebs? Does it seem dusty and disused? 20. This has definitely been disused. Disused? Is that a good word? "Abandoned" is a better word. But we blocked up the one we came through. Or can you put up a wall to where we don't have to worry? We have to rest, yes. Okay. A what? I can't believe we came without Pike, ever. Pike, stay with us forever. Wow. Well, there you go. I smack her on her little gelatin back and say, good work, Pike. What about Greater Restoration? Yay! Okay. I do that to Grog. How's that feel? How's that feel, big guy? But he's still coughing. Where the fuck are you? I swear to Pelor, if you would have gotten us killed... I glare at Vax and I lay down to go to sleep. It's under all your other attributes. I wake up to the terrible-- Ugh! What is that? Grog! And the guardian that Pike conjured is guarding us? Let's fucking rest! You're asleep. No, Keyleth went to sleep. Is she still here? Constitution? Yeah, you're right. I'm going to go sparkle stone. 16. You rolled a one, Keyleth? Should we, before we get this shit going, have a feast? A big fucking feast? We still have a couple of feasts left. Should we have feasted last night? So she has Feast. We get saves on all wisdom throws, which might come in handy when we're fighting against things that control our minds. You look lovely, dear. We can open it up. From here. You could Skywrite right now, as soon as we decide to start moving. Yeah. Open the rocks up. People start attacking the castle; we come from the other side, from within. Go in at the same time. Wait like five minutes to let them rabble up and start running. Yeah, but then you took down a whole house. I think we all need to go together. No, she's not fading on us, you dick! She's coming with us. A Heroes' Fucking Feast. That's pretty awesome. Heroes' Feast! It makes us more badass. You needed one more. You had one more, I thought. Oh my god, is it a holy feast? Do we all do holy damage now? Give me that pencil. I think it's 2d12. To do this! We should have sung "One Day More." To Vox Machina. Very quietly down the tunnel. Is it too big for you? Do you need maybe somebody stronger? (whispering) I think you're up. I think you need to move the fucking statue. Quietly. Oh no! Really? Trinket? Trinket tries to-- Yeah, he wants to get the fuck out of here. Doors of fucking Whitestone! Oh god. Only two?! I don't add his full strength? It doesn't fucking matter, because I rolled a three. As much as we can. And Percy. I'm rolling my giant foam dice for this. One. This is like the lid of a jar; everybody's loosened it up, and Pike's going to-- Seriously? Look at that. Pike, you saved the day. Again. Not yet! Trinket's really good at that. Yeah. Yeah, I start opening up crates. 18. Like whitestone dust? Can I gather some up in a bag? Hey, thank you so much. Wait, before he goes I cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone. Add ten! Because I cast Pass Without a Trace. But plus ten! Yes, it is. As I approach I put my finger over my mouth and look at her. Can she see us? Who are you? Who are you? He's the cutest. I walk up a little bit behind Scanlan and I insight check her to see what the fuck is going on. I don't know, they've all been betraying me! Don't you. Oh, that's good! 24. A week, that's it? Yeah. So here's the thing. There's a lot of violence that's going to happen. No. We should keep her in here for now. No, she's a lady. Has anybody been coming down and feeding you? Not on a regular basis? Can't detect magic? Try it. Hide in the corner. Stay quiet. Don't you worry. This is awful. You can be quiet. She can see me because I went down towards Scanlan. No, it was just his whip. We're the worst. I sneak up. Can we sense anything? We're not getting to see it yet. Ta-da! I think we should let her out. Yeah, we gave her food and water. No. Yeah, we're just the worst to old people. Let's get the fuck out of here. I can't pick a lock. I mean, I can try. I'm going to act like I'm trying to pick the lock and help her. But I'm going to not try very hard. I'm putting on a show for her. Oh, this is a really difficult lock. And then what? I snap the thing into the lock. Oh no. I knew I shouldn't have done that. I just don't know what I'm doing, but I will be back with someone who does. Oh, that's really good. 26. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Ashley, we're going to have to tell you so much. You've got to get picked up in like an hour. Ashley! Ashley, we love you. Bye! Oh, and I'm joining Monday Melee for Team Coco on Monday. Yeah. So I forgot to say that at the beginning. But yeah, it should be at like 11AM on Monday. 1130, something like that. Check it out. Yeah, I'll put something out there.
