Everybody except for some people. Sam! I know, right!? We're twinkies! I think you've said enough. (laughter) Just the worst. Was it? Oh, no. What are we going to do? Mostly dead. Not all dead. 'Sup. We have a present for Uriel. Open the gates. Are you questioning part of the council at this moment? Of course, darling, and you're doing a wonderful job of it. We have a present for Uriel. Open the gates. Send it up the chain of command. He is with us. What? Wait a minute! TRAVIS and Where's Trinket right now?! Why isn't he on the set?! I'm getting him right now. I know where he is. Help me. Can you see this? Travis, move your butt! I've got to get Trinket through! Please, Travis. Oh, he's here! Totally worth it. Is he good? Is he placed well, you guys? Oh my gosh, I'm so strong. Very low. We, look, we have a body over this bear! Let us through to Uriel; he's been looking for this man. Super important. Of course we did! No no no. No, you won't. Oh, well, not all me. This is all of us. We found your traitor for you. Yeah, he's beat up pretty bad, you might not want to-- Are you one of Vecna's children? Are you one of his priests? Are you one of his-- Everywhere. Good answer. Or are you like a zombie, straight, straight away up and at 'em? What if you come back as like a fish and then you're screwed and stuck in the water? And he's stuck waddling around. That'd be so sad. Unless, of course, you'd like to do it yourself. Digit by digit. He could strip you of all your limbs and leave you hanging. Not dead. Ew! No, no, no. Wake up, wake up, wake up. What's the marble? What's the little ball? What's it do? Oh, then you're not very knowledgeable, are you? I guess Vecna didn't tell you of his plans. Not very important. Blood? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's a good idea! Pike, why don't you bless him? Why don't you make him holy? Yes, it is. Sarenrae could always use new servants. Right, Pike? Aw, okay. Ooh, which one? All right. All right. Aw, that's not the good one. 11. Do I get advantage because Pike is helping? Haha! That's much better. 23! I mean, do you know-- Unless you have something to share with us. Do you know of his awakening? Do you have any details? Something that could lead us to him? Your god of secrets? You're right. And then he'll help us for sure. Yeah. What did it need? What would have made it time? It probably wasn't. Vecna's going to be so pissed at you. And then we'll kill him! Oh! Did it kill him? Did Greater Restoration just kill him? Oh gosh, this is so terrible. I know. I know. Sorry. Sorry. That was really awesome, Pike. Trin? Oh jeez, Uriel. I feel like I did, didn't I? When he was in-- Feel like it could have been more, honestly. Whatever. Should I add that now, or should I wait until it actually gets delivered? What should we do? Should we go home, then? Now the door incident really makes sense, if some of us were really drinking in that tavern. I like it a lot. What's the closest pub here? That was the worst one you've ever said. (laughter) None of us know this town. Oh, good. This is the worst pub crawl ever! This took two hours? Oh! I like that he's checking out his Yellow Pages. Have we been to Howarth's? Nice. Yeah. Oh, I would say you could buy, Scanlan, but you have no money. I did, so you have enough to buy for everyone. Sure. Oh no. Keyleth's been day-drinking and night-drinking. Oh god, that's so loud. Oh, really? I just remembered 5,000 gold is being delivered to the keep. Where can we go for food, Gilmore? Darling. Everywhere we go. Up-and-coming. I tell you that much. Can I sit down and talk to Gilmore for a moment? Gilmore? We ran into a really weird thing in Whitestone, and I bet you know some shit about it, because you know shit about everything. Kind of, yeah. Vecna? Bad news bears, right? Yeah. Yeah. I kind of almost died. (laughs) Because of him, I guess. Thank you. But yeah. There's a spinning ball of death, really. An orb that sucks things into it. It's black. It's underground. We don't know what to do with it really and I'm kind of worried, I guess, about it. They were trying to wake him up, but they said it was too early. They did it before Winter's Crest. Well, I feel like maybe they wanted it to get bigger? I don't know. Oh! Oh! There was a hand, and an eye, and-- Oh, really? What was he-- Just trying to be a god, is it? It's his thing. Well. Bad news. Don't worry. It helped. Helped us. Oh my gosh, Gilmore! This is the stupidest thing ever. And she's getting two. I got her. I got her. Help her out. I'll go help her out. Can I watch this conversation from the doorway? I'm just going to hang out and watch in. No, that looks terrible. That looks terrible! Don't do that. Don't do that! That looks really bad. Vax getting all the kisses. Goldschlager. Should we go home? Oh my gosh. Kick some dirt over her puke. How long have they been here? (splutters) How many times have we told you? Don't let guests in when we're not here! Oh, jeez. Who is it? Oh, Jesus. At least they're having fun. Is that little-- is it a halfling teenager that was picking pockets at the bar? Is he here? Can I walk up to him? I nudge him awake. Hey, Sticky Fingers. Hey. So I saw you at the bar, getting things off of people pockets. Off of people pockets? No, it's totally fine. I don't care. You haven't done that here, have you? No. We already ate. We're fine. We're so full. Did you try winking? It's certainly things we've done in the past. Are we talking about General Krieg's house, or are we talking about the guy that we first came into his house in Emon, remember? The diplomat. It's probably General Krieg's place. Rage-looting. It could be a different house. Does it sound like General Krieg's place? Did you get a description of the place? That's like every house, though. Because he was a dragon. Was that his house, that he's describing? We haven't agreed to it. We agreed to give you a cut if we go in. Here's the thing. If you haven't noticed, we have a keep. An embassy. We're known around town. We're council members. We can't go stealing things from people's houses. And then it was obtained by somebody else, who you don't know who it is. He was so dreamy. Do you remember him? We have one room, in addition to what we stay in. Would all of you be staying in the same one, or would you want to stay in the temple? You invited them to stay because you want to bone Kaylie? Where are you going, perv? (laughter) I'm going to stay up and keep an eye on the doors when they go into their rooms and make sure they actually stay-- actually, no, I'm going to go find Jareth. Jarett. Oh my. She's going to rob you blind. You're drunk, go to sleep. (laughing) What? Oh? She rolled high, too. Aw, a natural one. That was awesome. [break] I had, in the night I had gone to find Jarett. Just to tell him to keep an eye on the rooms and everything. Because, you know, I'm sure they're all great people, but-- I know they have some shady practices, so. I just want to make sure that-- Can I check around? Look around the keep and make sure-- I mean in the general area and see if anything's missing? Seriously, I do not trust these people. Yeah, where is our five-thou? Did it get delivered? I'm asking the guards at the front if anybody came from the keep, from Uriel. Where is it? What did it look like? Where did Erwen put it? Where did you put it? Where did you put it? Where's Erwen? Just tell me where the fuck Erwen is. Fuck. I go inside to find Erwen. You look wonderful today. Box, box, box, where did it go, box? The box that came last night. Yes. Our guests did? Our guests did? I go storming into the breakfast area. Dr. Dre! Dr. Dra. Hey! Yes. You had the best night's sleep here, I bet? So comfortable? Lots of wine? That box, give it to me now. That's so kind of you. I can read lips. What did he say? (laughter) Okay. Thank you so much! I open it up and count it. In case we got robbed. That's so kind of you. What nice friends you have, Scanlan. They're so giving. With someone else. It's normally so loud (laughs). Don't worry about it, Keyleth, we'll talk about it on the way. I fully, fully intend-- Thank you. Maybe if somebody wasn't so drunk last night, they would've had the information. Oh. Well. Aww. I don't want to steal anything either. Yes, she is, because it's our house. Trinket follows before I do. Keyleth, seriously, I don't want to steal anything. I want to find out why these-- They can't hear me, I'm whispering to her. We're walking. I want to find out why they want to get into the house. That's all. Something shady's going on. We're keeping things safe. I don't like them at our keep. We're fucking taking the fucking bear! That's my whole fighting fucking thing is I have a fucking bear. That's the whole point of the class that I took. I keep the bear. Yeah, classes. You know, writing, creative writing. Yeah. I'm learning things, every day. Yeah. Go around the back. Any signs of life? One. Can I ask you guys, before we do anything, maybe it would be best to tell the guards that we're investigating a disappearance? We've heard things about the house and we need to check inside. It's obviously shady if we go sneaking in, but if we say, "We're going in the house, because "we worry for it," then it's okay. Maybe, Grog. I mean, they probably have a key to General Krieg's place. We can just barge on in. Did somebody buy it after him? Oh. No. There's a gate around the outside. Anybody want a peanut? Subtle. So stealthy now. So you have a very wrinkly red cloak on right now. Asshole. I feel like we have a blessing of Sarenrae though to go inside. Oh right. Behind the tapestry, right? Trinket is actually really good at sniffing things out, so maybe he can lead us to the smell. Okay. It's too much, it's advantage because of his smell. Shut up. Shit, they do. 16? Is there dust on the ground? Has it been that long? Is there anything changing the dust? Is there any tracks in it or anything? Don't eat it, Grog. Nice. Sure, I'll go upstairs, too. There's lots of downstairs rooms. Oh, I didn't say perception, shit balls. Natural 20! (laughs) 14. All right. Yeah, teleportation circle. Remember there were a shitton of traps before we got to it. Yeah, smart move. Trinket, then me. Kind of like a god of secrets? What is this, history? 21. Oh! Oh! Wait! That's where Riskel was going to go. How long? I didn't hear because I was writing. But we know that that's where Riskel wanted to go as well. I want to pull out the symbol of Vecna that I took off of Riskel and-- Well Jarett's from there. Maybe you should not be touching it. I know, I want to go look at the tea set. Is that like an arcana check or--? Still, then its left eye is empty. Can I go take the top off the tea set and look inside? Is there any stamping on it to like show who it's from or anything like that? L.M. L.M. L.M. Oh. Yeah, definitely. Okay, can we go look at the teleportation thingy now? SAM and Isn't that the same doorway we found before? Is it flying? Maybe just put it over top of that skull and keep it hidden for now. Oh god, really? One! Use Luck. I don't remember. Wait, does it look like there's been anybody in here since we left? What in the (popping sound)?! That's my third one of the night. We suck. They all cracked. No. These were dragoneye things. Let's do it! Let's go through! Pow! 17. (gasps) No! Does it seem like this could have been made by a dragon? These scratch marks? Favored enemy. I'm scared of all of my d20s right now. A nature check? Plus two on dragon checks. Arcana?! I rolled a 16, but I get plus two on any investigation for dragon info stuff. Are dragons known for digging, or are there certain types of dragons that are known for digging? I wonder if he's the owner of the house. Sure, why not? Bag of Holding! We should definitely take that frozen man. Wait, Ashley. I can't hear her. What did she say? Oh, he is? He's dead dead? Maybe not. We're trying to get the gold out from the wall. I'm trying to get the gold out from the wall. He's going to be with us in the tunnel. I stop. Can we feel it? Okay, maybe we should stop. Just pause for a second! I hide. We have not? I hide. I hide in my cloak. Oh no! Ash, you have to be here next week, too! How much gold did we get, though, before it cocked up? You know, sometimes you just have to. You've got to.
