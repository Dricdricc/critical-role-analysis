Not forever. If you were sitting next to me, though, you'd be getting smacked in the head over and over again right now. Don't do it, Travis! Do you want me to stop while you're doing announcements? One day! We might have a small stock here for giveaways or something, but I doubt it. It already is online. I don't know. I think they're still up. Not on the stream. Aw, come on, how long have I already been doing it?! Is it retroactive? I can't do it the whole time. I got to sit down, you guys. I'm going to stop hula-hooping so I can play. Okay. Yeah! Ugh, so hot in this mocap suit! Are we talking battle chatter? This is really, really weird! How's it looking? That's great, because I barely trained, and I was floundering on the set. Oh, no, it's totally fine. It's barely seeable. I totally won't sue the company or anything. Yeah, I won't pay attention to what he's saying. Don't worry. Don't give him chocolate, Liam. I'm going to be standing. Are you making a Starbucks run? If you're doing a Starbucks run, I would love a Starbucks, please. I'm freaking out right now! What is happening?! Can they hear us? Are the mics live? Can they hear us? It fucking sucks! I couldn't move my arm for like three days. Don't touch it! Don't touch it. Don't. Oh, I see what we're doing now. Yeah. I am so embarrassed. I forgot my glasses at the session. That's okay, I'll be able to see. It's totally fine. Yeah, I can see it. I'll just hold it close. Enough. The felguard had their chance. If we're to end this scourge, we do it on our own. Quiet, we're not alone. Did I say scourge wrong? Scourge? Did Allen say the-- I'm sorry, is it on? I didn't hear the take number. Enough. The felguard had their chance. If we're to end this scourge, we do it on our own. Enough. The felguard had their chance. If we're to end this scourge, we do it on our own. Quiet. We're not alone. Can you hear us? Until the exclamation point, or the whole line? (groans) Got it. Thank you, Travis. Thank you, Taliesin. (burps) Enough! The felguard had their chance. If we're to end this scourge, we do it on our own. (sarcastically) Quiet. We're not alone. I'm serious, you should take the collar off of the dog. I can hear it. And we're just sitting here? Okay. Should we take a-- Oh, still no coffee. I sent him to Starbucks. Sorry. No, they have a Starbucks on the lot. Those things are awesome. You're right. You know what? What was I thinking? This is not what would happen. Oh my god. Was that an earthquake? What are you doing?! This is not okay, Liam. I want to stealth! Can Liam see us through the window? You can't send Taliesin out there. Baby. Can we try to get the door? I mean, is the door completely-- Travis, try to lift the ceiling up and I'll try to pull the door out. Just push the ceiling boards up some so I can try to open the door. Oh, it's our players! Oh jeez! Look how strong you are, though! You're so strong, baby! And then I'm going to try to pull the door open. Help him, Sam! Push up on the ceiling, too. I'm weak. I was trying to pull the door while he was pushing the ceiling up. Oh gosh, Bixby. It's the Valomilk one. Quietly! It's busted. Yeah, we want to try to be as quiet as possible. Oh jeez. Oh, this is good. What, what! 24! It's okay. We need to go the other direction, anyway. We can't see what it is? Can we put our flashlights on? Are there any other weapons? Just walk around to the other side. We have to get out that hallway, anyway! That's the hallway we've got to go! Oh jeez. Just go! No! So you don't cut yourself with all the weapons? I'm good with the daggers, I guess? Let's all run past it. Grab it on the way through, and get down the hallway. Are you going to split apart like Liam did? Just run around it. Seriously, though, did that look like Thordak to you? That's how I imagined Thordak looking. We have to get the fuck out! Run! Go! Grab the quivers! I'm running for my life. Jesus, Travis. Can I creep up and peek in the door with the light coming out of it? I just want to make sure there's nothing going to jump out. I turn off my cell phone light. Oh, so it's where the light's coming from? What did she say?! What did I hear? Cafeteria? I think Ashley's here! I thought of something else. How could she be here?! How could I have heard her voice coming from the server room? What the hell is happening?! Let's open the door to go up the stairs and then-- Out to the parking lot! Yeah! Oh jeez. Taliesin, get away from the door! Oh no! Advantage? Five. Are we still frozen in fear? I don't think we should try to go outside any more, guys. We're straight-up outside? Anything we could use to get around? I wonder if we could climb the water tower legs to see around. I don't think one arrow that is poorly shot is going to kill whatever that thing is. Sorry, but camp? Come on. I want to quietly walk out and see if I can climb the leg sticking up so I can see around the lot-- It's not that far! Really? It doesn't look that far. All right. I rolled so well last time. I'm really scared for that giant thing we saw. 11. Oh no. (shushes) Can we take off running? I run. I start running. Oh no! I don't want to fight it. Oh no! And this is all muck around us? Do we have little figures? You sent me a picture of it. Yeah, totally. I am really good with animals, I just want to say. Ten. Oh no, Tal. What are you talking about? Can you command beasts, Sam? Throw some gym equipment at it. Don't you have a dumbbell or something? It's a Clif bar! Does the protein powder gunk up its tentacles? Oh, thanks. Right. Oh! Do you get another arrow? Good. We're all lined up. This is smart. Well. Can I throw a dagger? But I'll lose it! I don't have a Belt of Returning! Does it look like the water's very deep? What should I do? No! Okay! I'm going to throw one of my daggers at-- is that stupid? I have three daggers. Okay, I'm going to take one of them. Dagger, dagger, dagger, and I'm going to dagger! And I'm hiding behind Travis. Am I hidden? 20! What do I roll for my-- But what is the dagger damage? Ugh! Five! Total! I did! It was a one. I know! I rolled ones on both dice. And then I hide behind Travis again. (gasps) Can we see that?! What the fuck, Taliesin?! (scream) We don't have a lot of health! Is it dead, is it dead? Is it dead? I run up and I grab my dagger out of that thing. (gasps) Go get Bixby! Why would you tell him to go get the arrow? Ugh, Taliesin, you have a tentacle hand. Why didn't you do that earlier? Oh my gosh, this is really freaking weird. Let's get out of here. I've got my daggers, I've got my backpack, let's get out of here. Can I look for our Jeep? I'm going to look for our cars, too. Oh, I drove here separately! 20! Can we climb it? Whatever's sturdy! What looks the sturdiest? I'm pretty good at climbing. Yeah, I'm going to try to climb the thing. I like that I really put my backpack on. I feel like we're on a mission right now. Oh no! What is it, athletics? Oh no. It's a seven. (shouts) Travis, push my butt so I can get up higher. Because it's going to break; you're too big! See? Open it! Okay. No, it's okay. I'm small. I'll be quiet. I'm gonna try to be as quiet as possible and climb the stairs. Our phones don't work, stupid. (whispers) What is that, what does that add to? 22! Oh, come on! 15! Oh no, it already died? Can I push through the leaves? I open the window. Come on! 14! Do I see the Starbucks? Do I see anything moving? Guys! I run down. Can I go back down? There's ooze coming out of the sky and filling up-- like yellow gunk filling up out of the sky. The sky opened up and then this stuff fell out. I don't know! I didn't see anything moving. Is it coming towards us? I get some Kleenex out of my purse and I try to get it off of him. I lead them up the stair path that I found. Don't step here. Don't step in that spot. Let's do that. Towards the commissary. Thanks. Good idea, Travis. I wiped all the stuff off of him. Sam, I'm pretty sure we're not getting paid for that session. Your house is gone. Can we see where it is? I want to peek out from the vines again. I open the window and look out the vines. (whispering) Well, birds are alive, still. So it's not all weird creatures. Should we try to get outside and see what's in the cafeteria? So maybe we should just get down to the ground. Good fucking call, Sam! I cut some vine off, and I wrap it up like a little whip on my side, there. Oh no. 16. Can you walk? You hit your tailbone really hard. I bet it's going to be really black. I've fallen that hard before. It really sucks. Yeah, it was just right across the way, there. One of the little tables. Are there any loose pieces of wood sitting around in the building? Can we rip some of the siding off? Five. I thought maybe we could like get some wood off and-- No. Put it down on the ground and walk across it in case there's goop in the grass. Travis. Can I have a piggyback ride? But I won't get my feet in the goop. Please? Please, Travis. I'm your wife! Thanks, Sam. I'll carry Bixby if you give me a piggyback ride. Are you serious? All right, I'm carrying Bixby and I'm on Sam's back. Are you stepping into any goop? Should I roll for Bixby now that I'm holding the dog? Nine and eight. Oh wait, no, that's a lie! Nine and 13. (gasps) Oh shit! Shit! I jump off of your back and I take off running. Towards where I think the cafeteria is. Yep! I'm protecting your dog! A perception check? Eight. That is it. We're such pusses. Nobody wants to fight. (hyperventilating) I'm okay. (whispers) Ashley? Do we have a lighter? Do you have a lighter? Taliesin. I miss you so much! SAM and Wait, this is it? What is going on? Is it crazy up there? Does it look like Last of Us around you? I give Bixby back to Sam. We're legit! This is so weird! [break] Yeah, something around there. We have to turn back the clock! Can we see anything moving, anything other than the tower? Oh, is it that goop? Sky goop? Riding the horse? This is serious. Are they even smaller than the previous ones? Oh no! I don't want to kill Liam! So wait, the Conan lich, O'Brien lich landed on top of the water tower? Oh jeez. 13? Oh no! Oh no! Seriously, we are going to die. This is a lot. Go, Taliesin! He's a warlock. Let's be honest. I hope so. We're level one! I'm already hiding there. Okay. Oh no. Am I hidden behind Travis? And Liams are just wandering around? Can I duck behind the husk of the car that I'm at? No? Is it hideable? I'm just going to duck a little bit, and I'm going to hold my turn-- Wil Wheaton's dice is out of the game! It was a nine that I rolled, technically. And I'm going to hold my turn until one of them is standing next to one of our people. Oh, you hasted to get to him? The minute he gets there I'm going to dagger! Do I get two daggers or just one dagger? Just one dagger I throw at this Liam. Okay. Ten! Oh, come on! I only have two daggers! I got to go find that other dagger! You're getting so good at this bow! We shouldn't kill him! We should kill the big old Conan! Oh shit, they can run really far. What did he say? Shazbot? Travis! Taliesin, help him! Wait, I didn't get to go! I'm going to run up. Am I close enough that I can attack the thing attacking Sam? I go, Travis are you okay? Stop hitting him! But he's flanked. Yeah. Oh yeah, that's a 24. Four. Five. 23! Everything. All at once. (laughs) Damn it. That's good. Nine. Oh no... But the dagger was still there in his body, right? I'm sorry, Liam. I need my dagger back! Oh no. Oh jeez. Catch it. Oh, that's fine. That's a dexterity? 23. Is Conan a bard? Oh, Sam! Liam sounds like Gollum! I'm up! I guess I'm going to run up, and can I attack one of the Liams? The Liam that's attacking Travis? I'm going to protect my husband! I'm going to jump on Liam's back and stab down! (laughing) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, brother! 15? Oh, good! (laughs) Nine. That is so terrible. Should we not kill these Liams? Can we open all of these packets? This is the strawberry taffy. Do you want some of it? There's some Zagnut left. 25?! I think I've got some Neosporin in my purse. What about your tentacles? Can you grasp his leg with the tentacles? Stand on Travis's back! This is serious! It's taffy! Which one? I'm going to kill Liam. Is somebody standing next to him? 24! 12! I'm scarred for life. Oh, I want to run. I'm going to use my movement to run for the tower. SAM and No! Travis! That is terrible! They're endless; we have to take out Conan. Oh no, Sam!  Oh no! I know! Did you just leave Sam on the ground? Is he down?! I turn around and I run back to Sam! What the fuck, you guys?! (laughter) I'm going to try and drag your body. I don't know! Is he right there? Can I give him some Neosporin? I rip off some of his t-shirt-- I rub all over his chest and try to warm up his body. Warm up, you motherfucker. 13. Shit. Fuck. I kick him. Come on, man, wake up. I guess so! No, you automatically hit. You don't have to roll to hit. Travis Willingham! You do not kill Sam Riegel right now! Oh my god! It's because you're turning against each other! Oh my gosh! Is she really a wizard? Oh, it's reconnected? Seriously, how are you guys so badass and we suck? Oh no! Oh my god. Oh shit. The lich is still alive? (gasps) We got to attack the Conan! 13. Oh no, a seven. He's on the ground! Be careful. Don't hit me! He was at level 20?! Fuck. Don't hit me. Oh, Chilly Touch! Am I still frozen? Or did it unfreeze me? Good job, Taliesin! Oh my gosh. You're turning into Grog. I thought that was going to fix everything. Are we supposed to still turn back time or something? I thought there was a clock we're supposed to fix. Oh my gosh, we fixed it? That was so much fun, Liam. I'm sorry I killed you so many times! Wait, how much time do we have left? Yeah, let's do that. Bixley? #criticalobrien! SAM and I hope you guys spell his name right. Good job, man. [break] Oh, hey guys! Oh, thanks for joining us, Sam. He really did, though. Is that the camera, or is that the camera? I feel like we could squeeze in. Would you consider taking-- Question Travis, are you really-- In this game? Oh man, that's so sad! I don't know. You can't count past six, anyway. That's so sweet. We're, what, 27? Are you in your 40s? Oh really? Do gnomes age differently? We are, too. We live around to 150, don't we? We probably look around 20. It was exaggerated. Pierce is real. Emma's real. All of the layout of the booths is exactly right. There is really gold coming out of the kitchen. All the time. And he started playing DND because of Critical Role! Yeah, that's right. I know, right? The abilities? I know, you're so quick. That's too hard. It's really fun to watch, but I would feel so intimidated trying to play. Who knows where life will take you guys? I think some people would be okay with that. Travis, on a scale of one to 22, how much do you-- oh. It went away as I was reading it. Shit, Taliesin, that was a while ago. I want those so bad! No, we're going to go! Yeah, we're going to go visit Ashley and go see. It's a problem. Which class would you have been, Liam, had you been playing? We would have been twinsie rogues again. Watch the shipping? I favorite a lot of drawings because I love looking at art of it. No, we're not! We did have a conversation out during the break about how hard it is to have an animal companion! Who is really cute and you want to protect it. But you want to take advantage of the fact that you have it. I know! At least you could pick up Bixby. Like, back in the day when we had to walk around with Trinket. Travis, you are my favorite! Like we can answer that! I know! I know! Because Ashley told me. Yeah, but I knew before. There was a question that I talked over, wasn't there? What? Your Titty? Your Titty Ruxpin? I thought it was a demon. Oh! I saw the question, what level were we when we all started the game? We were all level one when we started. Matt was very kind to us when we first started playing. People springing when we were trying to help people. Jumping out of wagons. Question. Does Grog have any love interests? (gasps) He does?! Sam, not having any time, ever. If anybody said that, I don't know if I'd be able to handle it in a session if they did what you did. Pick up! I'm sorry, pick up! Pick up! I would die. No! It's a broom, damn it! And here's the thing, here's my thing about the alignment. I was neutral good, stealing a lowly little broom, and I'm going to say that I did not realize, because I've never played this game outside of our game, that if you stole something from another player, it was a bad thing. No, but I just thought it was funny. Some people say it's a no-no to steal from other players. I didn't know that because he was coming on and it was funny, and it was a fun thing. Exactly! So I just thought it was funny. But Vex, for the most part, has very good intentions for everything that she does. So if anything, I should have dropped to just neutral, or is there such a thing as chaotic good? I feel like that's what I should have been, but straight-up chaotic neutral, I feel like was dropped two levels of alignment, which I think was wrong. I have talked to Matt about it afterward, because I feel like for where she is in her head for her to be that alignment. I'm a little worked up about it. You were great, Liam. Are there still tickets? Is it still up? Go check out the link, man! That's awesome. Can you show everybody your picture from prom because I just love it so much. Oh, were they? It was the first musical I ever saw. Seeing Phantom of the Opera is what made me want to be an actor. Once was so good! SAM and No! Hell no! I would hide. I wouldn't have gone out anywhere, really. I didn't have anything. I had a dagger. That's all I could do. You're right, being a rogue is lame. We told you to do it, and then we didn't even look. I just saw a thing saying did we have a baby. We didn't have a baby. We have a dog named Charlie, but no babies. Plus, we wanted Matt and Marisha to be here when we announce the winner. They're so good! I am not pregnant! I don't know! I pretty much agreed. And you really got pulled apart. When we were killing little baby Liams, was your brain in them? Oh no! That makes me feel so sad! I can't read this fast! I like that it's stadium seating. I like that it's a small theater because I'm afraid I would get so nervous if there was a lot of people. Scariest moment? Going into the Kevdak fight? I think we realized too late-- Plus, and then when we started, I was like, okay, we've got to get to Liam, we've just got to get to Liam. And then he throws those assassins in. I was not expecting that. If you would have rolled a one-- At the live show?! Oh man. I know, because we don't ever have any kind of romantic stuff. Yeah. Felt pretty normal. It was so weird to be at the studio and know the location and actually be able to visualize what you're talking about. It was so weird. Yeah! And the brownies! Yeah. I never feel angry, ever. Like, when we joke and we're like, fuck you, Matt! There's never any real anger towards him at all. It's a joint game and it always feels like he's trying to help us. That's awesome. Is that on YouTube? Plus, we don't necessarily know. You dumped Pike. It went so fast. Now it's going so fast! Who would win in a fight, Stinky Jules or Percy? And I am pretty damn sure Percy would win. Stinky Jules is a vicious son of a bitch, all right? (regular voice) I do think that her level is way lower, but she was pretty fucking cool. Discover it as we're playing it. We're working on it. There was a point when we were all talking about what we were going to do in the Kevdak fight, where we were like, can we technically do this? and Marisha was like, hold on, and she got up and walked in the other room and then came back. We were on Facetime with each other. She was like, Matt says you technically can't do that. That was a total joke. Travis plays all sorts of types. When he was joking about how-- Last question. It better be a good one, you guys. Why hasn't Scanlan's daughter smelled the poo note and taken it out? Who knows, she might've! Who asked that question?! Yeah, that one was pretty bad. You would have realized it was all an illusion. I think my biggest regret is that I couldn't bring Vax out of his sadness that he was feeling. As a sister, I wasn't able to-- I couldn't bring him out like no Raven Queen could! That made me sad. Poke your head up out of a pool of blood. Pirates.
