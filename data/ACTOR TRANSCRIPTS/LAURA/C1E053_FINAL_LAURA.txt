Woo, Dallas. Squeeze us? I love how well your shirt and your hoodie match your hair. It's pretty fresh. So fresh and so clean. What? What is this thing? Is it a baby bear cub? Is it a real bear cub? (gasps) Oh. My. Gosh. Shut your face! Happy birthday twinnie, fly high. Thanks brother! Oh my god, I want to ride it around right now. Does it really fly though, that's the thing. (squeals) Oh, this is so cool! It'll look so good in the house! It's so perfect. It's going to go on the mantle. (sings) That was Ariel, singing Little Mermaid. Keep singing! Thanks, brother. Thank you so much. I don't have your gift for you here. Make him hold it! Thank you, that's so wonderful. Don't steal it, Trinket! You won't fit on it. Of course. But we'll bring him home, then we'll find your grandfather. Or we can take him home and meet you. Does any of this look familiar to you, darling? Yeah. And your grandfather lives in this area as well. I pat Trinket's butt. It's okay. Oh, be careful! I walk up behind. Hello? Is anyone home? It's relatively safe--er. Than it was. Knock-knock, we have your son, safe and sound. Special delivery for child's mum. Of course. Well. No, darling, put that away. Truly, put that away. And not even slightly dead! Oh yeah, he killed the bad guy. I think it's paint, I think it might be paint, they were painting. Quite an adventure. Have you-- sorry. Have you seen a small elderly-- an older gnome? Yes, have you seen him, is he all right? All right. Yes. Trained in it. That's sick! A fun trip. (whispering) One last question, this is it, I swear. Are you familiar with anyone in the farming area just outside of town? We're looking for a woman who was a daughter of one of the gentlemen that worked in the fields, and we really have no idea how to go about finding her. Reginald's daughter, yes. All right. You know where to find us, we'll be about. I know! I mean, good thing he never died. You have a secret knock you maybe used? He might have very soft footfalls. He's barricaded the door, that's a good thing, that's a really good thing. I go and look through the window, is there a window? What do you see? Oh. Well. Pike, after you. Pike, did he have any hiding places, like that other house? 18. Percy! Wilhand? He knows us, Grog. Yes, well of course they did! Who hasn't heard the legend of Wilhand? The seven seas? Perfect? Perfect in what way, leaving or fighting the dragon? We really should have a conversation about that. Pike's going to be so fucked up. Finish the bottle? You know what we should do? Bring him into the mansion. You can show his people that work at the mansion how to cook, 'cause they are terrible, I can tell you that much. He's been drunk the whole time. Wait, where are we going? Oh right, Master Quall. It's true, it's true, I mean, it could be one of the best times to attack. Is there anything you want to bring with you? He's your uncle? I thought he was your grandfather. (whispers) And he's super interested in her. Yeah, we walk and talk. It's at the fountain crossroads-- Percival! Well, honestly, isn't the dragon going to come pick up its loot in the next couple days? It's happening tomorrow? I'm glad we have a mansion to hide in. They're not good people. They killed a lot of innocents. It's possible we can wait for all of the goliaths and other barbarians to attack the dragon, and when they all leave the city, we bar them out, take the city back. Well. The dragon could be content fighting them. We take the time and get everyone else out of the city. On the other hand-- --when are we going to have a better opportunity to kill a fucking dragon than with 40 giant strapping-- We can't leave the people in this city under the rule of any more of these monsters. We have to get people out. Will they? After they ransack everything again? How do we get everyone out? And he'll come find us. But we can't kill all of them at the same time. It's got to be a one-by-one process. The white one that we killed, or the white one that we also saw? Yeah, that one was real bad. Yeah, but all those guys, they were, I mean. They had strong attacks. What if we put out the loot, let him come down and get it, and then we throw big ropes up and over him or something? Will they? Dragons are vain, how do you know they won't just find that dragon weak and think that he's not worthy of them-- Does it look like it's been ransacked at all? I do have a coin with a 20 and a one on it. Are we going-- Silently, quietly walking up to the front door? It's already partially ajar. Of course, brother. D'you want me to look around? From out here? I can actually walk in? All right. I stand exactly in front of the door and don't take any more steps. I look for traps visually. Oh, well, give us just a moment. Yeah, but that's a good idea. 24. There's stairs, we're at the bottom of the stairs. Are there doors in this main-- it's like a foyer? All right. Ohh. Trinket, dear? Come on, come on, d'you want to go in the locket? You do? If you don't, you can wait out here but it's probably safer in the locket. Don't be sad about it, if you don't want to, I'm not going to make you. Ooh, I love him so much. What was it like, Grog? Can we check out the stairs and make sure nothing's wrong with the stairs? Oh, I did not see anything. I'm going to stand here and watch you do it, actually. Oh, what? Are you fucking kidding me right now? You're a moron! D'you want to get your whole body in there? What are shitty pillows? Was that fun? Was that fu-- I'm looking, I'm checking out those stairs too. I wouldn't have slid down the fucking slide, I would assume that leads to death. I don't need to throw a pillow down the slide to know-- No. 21. Dick. (laughter) Can we read it? Do we understand it? The carpet? Maybe Scanlan has an idea what it is. Scanlan! You know this rune over here? This little glowy rune right here. Look closely. I go get a pillow and I throw it at the rune. How'd it work, does that, is that how you're supposed to do it? So wait wait wait, the last time you saw runes like this, you lost the carpet. How did you lose the carpet? So it might disenchant whatever we have on us. Well, how do we make it not burn us? Who can undo magical thingies? Whoa! Oh, what is it, what was it? If it was bad it doesn't count, but if it's good it does. Good job, Pike! I thought we could skip over that one step and then there was up. Yeah! Yeah, we can jump over that little gap. Hmm, all right, I get on the broom and I float on up to that landing and I look and see if there's any traps on the ground. Without setting foot on it! I don't know, you're pretty heavy. You might fit-- (gasps) It's nothing to brag about, scrawny. Minus two! I am equally scrawny. (laughter) Dangle well onto the bottom, you can hang off the bottom of it. (spitting sound) Don't. Fucking. Let go. Obviously! Ooh, Master Quall was a little freaky I think. Can we look under the bed? 17? Can I look under the bed? I check for traps on the chest. 26. I try to open it. It's locked, it's locked, open it. Open it. Do you want me to try to pick this lock? Because I am very talented as a rogue. Well then fine, I'll try to unlock it. Is this how you hold it? This is how you hold it, then? 24. 24. Is that saving throws or regular? Okay, yeah, 24. Hey, look at that! Thank you. All the gold, all the gold. Ugh. Why would he take the shit out and then lock it and put it back under the bed? What a douche. I did, I did, I checked! I was saying it, I said I'm checking all around the fucking chest, that's what I said! Oh my god. It's a key. You know what? We're going to get downstairs and this key is going to unlock the thing that has the circlet, I know it. What? I love you. Yeah. Because it's fun. I'm sorry, who's talking, who is this? I double-check the room for-- What would you like me to look for again? I rolled a one. Nothing else to find, I found the key, dammit. Yeah, we checked all the rooms. We checked the other room already. Hop on the broom. You can sit sidesaddle. Hey, I like this plan. (whispers) Look, Percy, I found a key! What did you just do? Trinket's in my locket. But do you want Trinket with you? 25. (whispers) Hey, Pike. Do you think you can try dispelling magic again? Because there's some shimmery sort of shit on this door and I don't trust it. What? If I stick it in and I turn it and it explodes and I die, oh, I don't know, that's never happened before-- Shit. Oh, your invisible servant! Yeah, go do that! Let's all step back, step way back. Back it up, back it up. What? I'm holding the key up to Mort. I don't know where he is. Hey, maybe? Yeah. I walk through the gust of wind and get my hair tousled. Sorry, Mort. Can I look around for a fucking circlet? 16. Yes. That looks very similar. A golem that was up in the wall. How about we tie its legs up? Just like we did before. Just in case he comes alive, then he can trip and fall. I don't care, I start tying a rope around his legs. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. So we fought this other thing because of Quall. Well, because that's what he does. He wanted the orb to bring this thing to life. If I take a step forward, does he look like it has any kind of reaction? I'm going to keep trying to tie around his legs. All right, well. I feel safer. Really? Can you try to look at its chest? It has a little blue glimmer in it. Climb down and look and see if you can-- Just look and see what it is. Can I see if the golem's wearing a circlet? We should keep looking. Anybody else want to look around the room for the circlet? Well. We have the thing. Including the golem? Oh! Yeah yeah yeah. Oh shit, oh wait, his legs are tied up-- He looked like a moron. That was amazing. I'm on the ground laughing. 21. What I rolled. How do we get him out? I don't know. Okay, yeah, I pop Trinket out. It says a creature no more than large in size. So no? I walk up. He's not going to hit me, is he, Keyleth? Spike! I don't know, I just liked the name. Can he talk? Why? Can he put his finger down, and I hold the locket up. Hey, Fassbender. Nope. No luck. Oh, that's good! But I think he moves rather slow. How fast can he run? Well, he's rather loud. Let me see how many spells I have left. I think I do. Yeah, I can do Pass Without a Trace, I have a couple left. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, including the golem. This thing is awesome. That's true. He actually might be able to hold onto it. At least for a little bit. So the dragon could probably like fly away with it. Wait, can he get through the mansion door? Oh god. We'll show you what he looks like in the mansion. I see you're wearing the gauntlets, Grog. Yay! What? Do you want help? Probably should've brought a ranger with you, I'm really good at tracking. Is that what you said? Oh my god, did you send your daughter down to get attacked by a giant bulbous shit? You guys are lost forever in the sewers. (laughs) Who doesn't? That's a lie because I said Spike. You're healed, you're healed up? Do we know if we can heal him once we damage him? Ping? You can-- Oh no! How do we fix him? Oh no. Oh no. Just think, the fun thing is, I think you're aging much slower than the rest of us. That's cool, that's cool. Ooh, I wonder if it can like earthquake. Nice. Try taking it off, Kiki. I am going to throw something at you! Do you have Identify? Do you have Identify? I'm asking you, not you. Wait, that's damage. Well, fucking hand 'em over, we'll sell 'em for stuff. Grog, I don't trust your haggling skills, I promise. We should probably figure out if we're going to fight a fucking dragon in the morning. Oh, gods. We're going to go talk to him tonight? We need to sleep! What library? Here, the Cobalt Reserve? Yes, and we still haven't found Reginald's daughter. Oh, she's in prison! Let's go sleep now, wake up, go let the prisoners free, and then talk to Kev-- Zanror. Short, short talk. I am-- I stand by what I said before, I think we should let them go out and fight a dragon, and we try to rescue the city while they are distracted. Are there any big trees in the city? An entire fucking city. A little. (whispers) I think that went well. We should eat and then sleep. I go and whisper to Scanlan, are you all right? She didn't. I sort of meant about Kaylie as well, though. Yes. Of course she is. And then we don't really fight. Well, we see how they do, and we try to rescue people. No. I'm not separating from you when we go fight a giant fucking dragon. What does he say? You speak of pride, of listening to reason. Might be smart to listen to reason in this instance as well. That dragon is ancient and very large. It's quite possible he'll wipe out all of us, the town included. It might be smart to swallow our pride for the day and prepare. Come back when we have preparations made and we can take the dragon down. How many people do you have with you? Vex'ahlia. Why? Saving throws. Our tiny people are pretty fucking powerful. We killed a white dragon, motherfucker. Aye. How many do you have left? After they left. 25. Something that explodes it? Something that traps it? (sings) He doesn't need it. Acid. Yes. You'll release the prisoners? We totally planned at dawn! (laughter) Oh, shit! It's like pilot season. Oh god.
