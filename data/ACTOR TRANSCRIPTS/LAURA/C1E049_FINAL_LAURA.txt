What if you kill him? What if he dies while you're-- What happened? There's always tomorrow, darling. Tales from the Borderlands? The BAFTAs already happened. She didn't. It's all happening that night? Longest night ever! MARISHA and Spectacular, spectacular. Don't build it up too much. Now they'll be expecting it, Matt. Different characters. We weren't our regular characters, but equally fun, I thought. I played Jester, a tiefling cleric. Yeah. You were a dwarf paladin. I don't remember. Ooh, hello! Oh. These glorious boxes? So wait, this is a regular Sentinel deck box. This is another box. This one has our logo etched into it. It says "How do you want to do this?" Sweet. Crit. Role! Oh, it's right in between it. Total dicks. And all of that with just a stump. No, he had to show us where the orcs were. Did I cast Pass Without a Trace on us before we headed out? Then I'll cast it again so that he's incorporated in it and I think we should try to stealth it. Hey. Hey, Wonderbrain. I think it would be smart if we moved as quietly as possible. You know, keep a distance. When you hear no more fighting, it's probably safe. Probably. What? No, don't-- I take it back and I give another dagger to him. Don't accidentally stab yourself because I think it sucks your life energy out of you. Yes it does, it definitely sucks your life. 25. Oh! It's not above 25. I think you are so right. And I'll take that from you. And in exchange, I will give you this wonderful opal dagger that I have on my person. Still very sharp. What? What did he just tell you? I wasn't paying attention. He's lying. He always lies, don't pay any attention to him. You're safe with that. Jesus! And then as he walks away, it poofs back into his fucking belt. I don't see anything at all. One. Off to the races. (whispers) What is it? Hello, salute, running away. Use your words, Keyleth. Talk. Are they headed this way? So I cast Pass Without a Trace on us, so should we stealth? 29. What?! He's a dot. I do. I like it. Can I search the ground and see if there are a lot of tracks around? Or is this like a roaming party? I think we should take them out before they get back to their group. We're supposed to slay them and stop them from-- But what if we kill them now, we won't have to fight them-- But I can follow tracks. Fine! Fuck it! (whispers) Oh! They're definitely bad. Oh my god, look at that camp! Where are the wine barrels? So next to the tents that the prisoners are being kept in. What time of day is it? Well, I'm a little hurt. I think it would be good to create a distraction. We go in, save the prisoners and then take out the camp. And then we can stealth down-- Okay. And then, once everyone's clear, we bring them back and kill them all? Or what? And find out. How do we get all the prisoners out very quickly? Scanlan, could you potentially put all the people in the door? I'm saying get the prisoners safe so that nobody's running blindly into the forest. What if you spent some time, a minute, creating your mansion, you have a little door here. Once you've created a distraction, we can all run up and put them in the door and then we fight. And then we get the people out of the mansion. Not near the bears. Okay. LIAM and All right, so we sneak around to the back. We'll make the door far enough away. Do it, make the door! Make the door behind one of those trees. Get ready to do a distraction right fucking now. No, I'm staying on the other side. Charge in after the distraction. Oh, Pike did come? We said Pike could stay, because she's not stealthy. And then run the other direction. Yeah, that's good, that's good. Yeah, that's little creatures. Seriously, like a giant scorpion would be probably pretty cool. Fairies? They are! Oh my god. Then probably don't. It's true! 16. Yeah. That's so sneaky. Do we also hear a little dryad voice? I'm going to run forward. Well, actually, I'm going to stay hidden. Okay. I'm going to-- I know, I know, I know. Can I stealth forward? Okay, good, then I stealth forward, towards the camp, towards the tent, away, staying away from people. Yeah. Is that as far as I can go in, towards the tent? Then I'm going to stealthily-- I'll be able to get to it on my next turn? To the tent? Okay. Then I'll shoot one of the guys. That-- Yeah. That's really hard to hold steady. Yeah, I'm going to shoot him. Yeah. 18 on the first. And 30 on the second? Okay. 15, 16, 17. And that's sneak attack? Five is 22? Second attack is five, seven, 13, no 14. 12? I can add. 13, 14. Oh no, I don't get sneak attack on the second. 14 on the second attack. I use my bonus action to hide. 36. Oh, Pike! But she's really strong now, with the Guiding Bolt. Yeah! Are those the ones I gave you? Get them out. You should roll in your box. Oh no! Oh, me? I thought Travis was after-- Oh, every time? Oh, okay. I want to shoot Trinket out into a Cannonball from-- Okay. I'm going to move up to where I'm lined up with all of that row, so this whole shebang right here. Yeah. All of these guys. And you too, because you practiced it with him. Take out the thing and say, Trinket! Cannonball! And shoot him out and try to roll into all those guys there. Right. His move is 40. Three attacks. Oh god, really? He gets advantage because he's awesome. MATT and He rolled pretty fricking bad. 12? 15? One! MATT and What is that? Cannonball, exclamation point. Cannonball. Yeah. You know what, you sent it to me forever ago, it's in my email somewhere, Matt. Can you tell me what magical beasts I can conjure while you're at it, because-- 2d6 plus eight, okay. I suck. 2d6 plus eight. 12 on the first. That's better. 17 on the second. Yes, good job Trinket! Good job, buddy! 20! Really dizzy though. Okay. Can I use my bonus, though? Do I have a bonus action on top of that? Hide? Natural 20! Oh no. Look at how teeny Trinket is compared to the other bears! You can do that? Man, that's a good thing to have. No! No! Ha! Trinket's yawning. Soft earth. Yes! What! 12. That was a good turn. Yeah. Not unlike a raven taking flight. No! All right, I'm going to turn Trinket around, he's going to attack that dude that got a hit on him. The one behind him. Oh shit. Okay, he runs up to the one on Grog. But he moves out of the way so that I can get a clean shot on him. And he bites him and he claws him! Okay. Huh? I still get a bonus action, he gets to attack and I get to attack. Yeah, he gets two attacks because of Bestial Fury. Gosh darn it! That one's good, okay. He bites the shit out of him. What is that, 13? No, 12. And then I'm going to shoot him from my hiding spot. All right. 20. Great. 16 plus sneak attack. 19. While that was going on, I wanted to run forward and work on the guy that fell from the tree. I wasn't paying attention to that. Does he look like the description that we got? You're stronger than Pike again. No-- Wow. Are you survivors of Westruun? You're safe now. As is your camp. Small, older, gnomish fellow? So he stayed in the town. What's your name, darling? Vanessa. You're very strong, Vanessa. Oh, well, thank you. Do you like bears? Not those scary ones but really nice ones? Trinket sits back. He's friendly. I go for that circlet that was on the war chief. I inspect it first. Was it human bodies or animal bodies? Oh, quite, come on over! The circlet? No, we do have some stuff in it. All right, yeah, I'm keeping some boar meat. I thought you were a vegetarian. I like it. I'll hop on the broom. Yeah. Can I stealth in the air? Can I wrap myself in like my-- I'm not that giant, okay? So I usually get advantage, so I'll just roll regular. Oh! Oh! You know what, I still have Pass Without a Trace, because I never cast Hunter's Mark to break that concentration. 23. I like it. (cackles) I'm so scared of all my dice right now. 17. Oh wait! Favored terrain. Forest at the edge of the mountain. Okay. 17. I don't think we should land on the ground, we should just stay above. You can't talk when you're a bird? Oh. This is really smart, you coming, because we can't do anything. Do you want to pop out of that, can you pop back in? One caw for yes, two caws for no. You can't even understand me right now? This is ridiculous. I float down gracefully on the broom and give it a little bit of a closer look. No no no, I'm still in the air, I'm not on the ground. What do you think, Scanlan? Back up a little bit and shoot a flaming arrow into that? Sweet. I back up a little, far distance away, and shoot a flaming arrow into it. And it's not moving, it's not fucking moving right now. Why are you trying to do this to me right now? Why you got to be a player hater? Well. That looks deep. I don't think we should check this out on our own. You're a bird, you could probably fly in and fly back out. Should've been a fucking owl. I float up to the edge of the mouth of the cave and say, (whispers) Scanlan? (whispers) Are you alive? What if that's his face? I stay at the mouth of the cave and say, (whispers) Scanlan, are you alive? (whispers) Scanlan? Wait. Scanlan! Is that you? You were a crow. Okay. That's you. Should we go? We should go back. One hoo for-- I start flying back. You're exhausted. And some boar! How you doing there, Grog? And I slap him across the face a few times. Yeah? That's good. They'll know how to get back. Yes. Will you and Cyrus inform everyone else that it's safe for them-- oh shit, we're not back, they can't go there. We'll be back, and we're going to send you to Whitestone, where you'll be safe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, it's yours, darling. You too. You can keep the opal dagger I gave you. Scanlan, did you see how generous I was just then? What's wrong, Grog? Whispers about Grog? You've never had a whisper? What, no, there's not. Wait. So did we already tell everyone what we saw? Yeah. Blue light. I keep an eye out for any enemies along the way. I'm going to do that with advantage because I'm in the woods. 25. Let's go this way and then circle back. So this is the place. Technically, Scanlan flew in, so I don't think he had to check for traps. Does it look like water reflection? Can I investigate the walls? Did you already check for traps in this room? Wait. Start at the beginning? Can I get on the broom? And fly up above the pool of water and look down into it? 25. Oh my gosh Keyleth, you're so smart! Keyleth! Use the thing to see magical runes! Really thought it was going to do something, I really, really did. I watch it go down. Hey, that's a good thing. Should we control it, or-- At disadvantage. It's going to be so bad. Oh god! It's got to be water. Can I see them coming up? What the hell happened? What was down there? Yeah. Is it a fast drop, or do we float down with that water? Nice! Go where? I'll go next. Yes yes yes. He's in my necklace. Can't move quickly. Oh. Swim up. I catch myself on the broom and I fly. And when they're not wet enough. It could be four sphinxes. How high is the ceiling? Yeah, it's four sphinxes. I'm flying, so I'm up near it. Can I investigate it? I'm not poking my head into it, I want to get a closer look. Investigation or perception? You said perception? I just want to get a closer look at the circle. 19? It said in the previous room, "the sky is a window." Does that pertain to this? Which we came through. Are there any runes on the gold around that circle on the ceiling? Is it the same language that was around the-- Abyssal, Draconic, Elvish-- I grab the Hunk of Quall and I float it up to the ceiling. I take the Hunk up to the ceiling. How did you make this work, Keyleth? Does that mean these are magic? I can't remember what this thing does. Wind blows! Fire burns! Yeah, I go over to one of the other pillars and blow on it, the one under the air part. How do we do earth? Oh shit. I fly up into the hole in the ceiling-- I fly up into the hole. I drop the endless rope down from the hole as I'm flying it up so there's a rope in the middle of the room; so that everybody can go for, I'm flying up-- Yeah. No, it's on my cloak. Rope of Infinite Twine. Oh. Fuck! All right, fine, I fly back down-- Gimme gimme gimme the rope. I tell him to hold on to one end as I fly up. I let go, the rope should be coming out of the robe. No no no, I'm trying to let the rope out as I'm flying up. Is there anything to tie rope off onto? What about the doors? Are there handles? Shit. Keyleth! Do you have the Immovable Rod? I fly down and I grab the Immovable Rod. Tie the rope onto it. Climb it, climb it. Can I fly back down and grab Scanlan? Well I go down and I grab Pike then and I go up on the broom. Can I use Pike's shield and try to direct it to where some of it isn't coming--? Oh, maybe Pike should do it, because she's way stronger than me! She's got 19 strength now! Yeah. I thought we were doing what we were supposed to do down there. Jeez, it would've been better if we would've just gone up the hole. A name is earned. Yes. Or his name. Now there's fire. That was really smart, Grog. Does it cure exhaustion if he takes a short rest? What was that second line? "Knowledge dost billow--" I'm peeking through the door at this point. I walk up next to him. Oh yeah, I see what you're talking about. Yeah. Smart. While he's doing that, I want to use Primeval Awareness to sense celestials. That's not a spell slot, it's just my-- Oh! Expend one ranger spell slot! I have never, ever done that. I have never even looked at that bold-- Wow. I am sorry about that, Matt. Can we see all the way to the end? 16. Those doorways? Is it far away? You can set my arrow on fire and send it down. Oh. Just don't want to walk down there. Let's get in the doorway and then if something happens we shut the doors. If you want to walk in. Oh my gosh. Hold your breath as you pass the wispy wisps, I don't trust them. Just open with a brazier at the end. I'll take the middle. Maybe you should do that. Oh my god! His name, what is his name? Jeez Louise. Any ideas? 19. That map is awesome. Oh. Do I feel old? Oh, jeez. I shout out-- I run towards the other water portal. And I shout out, Pike, do you know the names of the four ancient gods? Is your name four? That's stupid. Yeah? I wouldn't have any religion, anything to base that off of? Wow. Wow. Two! That's four ones in a night. I've been cursed. I have an advantage on anything having to do with dragons. Well, I was just checking. I saw Percy dip his hand into the water, so I do the same thing to see what it does. I put my hand in the water. Does it hurt? Pull it back out. Can I use a bonus action to try to hide? Is there anywhere to hide? Maybe against a wall or something? I feel like we're so stupid, we should know this. "The four endure, the four remember." 24. 24. Obelisks were in Elvish. Down to 79 strength. We're all going to die! Why?! 30. 30. Ah, c'mon! That hits me. You go ahead and suffer! Say it in Celestial, Percy. Maybe that's his name. Power. The sky. The sky. 23. 22, that's a lie, 22. Wait, but I still rolled a 22. I take back my glare. Can I look up at the ceilings and see if there's any portals on the top of the ceiling like there were in the last room? 29. Is there anything to tie the Robe of Infinite Twine onto? Do I still have the Immovable Rod from before? Okay, then I put the Immovable Rod, I tie it in, I hold on to the rope, and I jump in the water. Yeah, I pull myself back out. Oh my god. K-A. Other door. But make sure there's a rope. Jump in the water. Make sure you can get out. The little brazier that I'm next to. But don't jump in without a rope. Yeah. Make sure you can get out. Okay. So many whispers! Maybe. I don't know. How long is his name? Oh. You're right. J-I. Kaiju. I don't know. Hey, we're on twitter, you guys! @CriticalRole. Oh no, Grog can't read. (laughter) It's like a-- There's a circle. (Grog voice) Also ale. Was that O-I? Grog? What if it hits Pike? Pike. Plus 2d6 necrotic. That's the saddest thing ever! Grog, what did you see? I guess I-- Jesus. Can I bring Trinket out? That's stupid. If I, well, I'm going to go and try to see what's going on over there with the sphinx. Can I see Grog? Can I run forward and cast Cure Wounds on Pike? She's got a fucking sword in her! Can I help her? I mean, does she still have a sword through her, can I pull her off of it and then cast it? I know, I-- oh, natural 20! It reminds me of what happened to Pike before. Grog, snap out of it! And I cast Cure Wounds on Pike's stomach. Level three. Three. 17. Six. So hard to get these last two fucking letters. The first one was 15? Wow. But as a half-elf you have a longer life, so really at age 50, you're not that far in. But your rage ended. Natural 20. It's planted next to the water. But my rope is attached to it and it's dangling next to me. I dropped it when I healed Pike. So it's right next to me, I pulled the robe over to there. 19. I know, it was really close. Of course. 28 points? Maljikaori? Maljikairi? Kaorimal? The order was fire, earth, water, air. That was the circle. So it could be in any of those orders, maybe. Yeah. I'm unconscious. Six. Hey, it's better than zero. Thank you. I'm alive! (laughs) Oh no. This aging thing, is it permanent forever? Nine. We're seriously going to die. I look at Vax and laugh at him because he's so much older than I am. You too. Secret doors. Obviously. Oh, thank you. I know, I'm like, there's going to be a test later! That got so much more intense than I ever thought it was going to. Yeah, I thought we'd go and talk to this guy. Do we need to go after all of them? We'll do it; we'll talk about it later. We took the weapon off the ground before he portaled us out, right, Matt? Wow! Oh my gosh. That was long.
