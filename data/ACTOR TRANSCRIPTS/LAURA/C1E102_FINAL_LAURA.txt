Oh my gosh, all that crazy merch that we have! We have those posters, you guys, those amazing David Mack posters that look so pretty. The signed versions are going to be in the store for one more week, and the non-signed version is going to be in the store for two more weeks! And that's it, and then they're gone forever. So tell your friends, tell your buddies, tell everyone you know. That's right. And we also have our Scanlan concert tees and our Slayer's Cake aprons. Our hats are out of stock, but everything else should be in there if you guys want to go check it out. In the shop at Geekandsundry.com. Hey, you're welcome. Do you want to make a special announcement? But they're so pretty! Wait, do I put that on my saving throws, too? Because I was doing it wrong this whole time. Yep. Time out, time out, time out. Yeah, like super stat. Right? It's all just night, all the time. Oh, we look like the gloom stalkers! No, those are the flying ones. Scary ghouly creatures. I cast it when we landed here. I don't think so. So it's still going? Yeah, I didn't Hunter's Mark either of the guys that I attacked. Yeah, that thing. The smoky thing. If we stay in this... tight. No. I see nothing wrong with this plan. Do you have that ability? There's no trees on the top of the tower. Then it'll take us a minute to not be mist anymore, and by then they'll realize we're there on the top of the tower. Sure, why not? I mean, we're undead. We look like we're undead. Blend in. Are we at full health? I'm not either. Should we take a 30-minute rest and roll some hit points? I don't know if there's actually time for that, though, to take. We're going to fucking potentially fight Delilah Briarwood. Is it considered healing as we walk there, though? I just don't know if there's time. If she's already started a ritual. Yeah. All right. Oh. Who's in a robe? We're all undead. I'll take a robe. Yeah. I want to keep an eye out, just to see if anybody's noticing. If it seems like people are paying attention to us in a way that they shouldn't be. 17. Coming right for us? Is there a road we can turn directions? Kill it. Nice. Very nice. So cool. Does it seem like both of those factions are still-- are they clustered in the same groups? Keep up near the thing. Everybody get close to the censer. Hopefully they'll be affected by the censer. The whole group. So we can all be with the wispy smoke. We're normal people in robes. Can I just waft some of the smoke towards them? You got this, Pike. These skeletons are almost as old as you, Scanlan. I have an idea. What if, right when we get close to the tower, all of these trailing skeletons that we have on us, you just Turn Undead? And then you control them all? Oh, you can't control them? I thought you could. She can make them poop. Hey, did you guys know that Travis is the smartest guy at the table? Is there a building we can duck into? 33. And a roof. (grunting) Why am I? I can talk. Go in that building. That way they can't dive bomb us, at least. The right. Weapons drawn in case there's something in there. Me, maybe, because we saw it. 20. Are there dark corners that anybody could be hiding in, or another room? We'll keep the censer near the door. Wait. I was going to say, what if we turned ourselves into something else and snuck out, and they would think that we're still in this building? Anything that was tracking us. She's sweeping as she's running towards the door. Is there another door in this building? We should go out the other door as fast as possible. But quietly. We don't want them to know that we're getting out the other side. They're going to know that we're not. They know we're not zombies. We've got to go. Out the door, out the door. What dead body? Actually, yes. Throw a dead body in the room. And use Dust of Tracelessness as we run out the door, so they don't follow us. Me. Please? Should we look for another building we can duck into? To lose their-- So they can't find us? Natural 20. Did you add ten? Natural 20. Is there another door in this building that we can exit out? 19. Fuck. You found a new use! Maybe just give it to Percy. Yeah, yeah. I don't have any way to make fire, but I'll take it. Definitely in my shirt now. It's gone? Did it fly away? Should we leave, and go to another building? I feel like it's not really gone. Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us again? Are we running out of time on it? I'm going to cast it again, just so we don't. Dust of Tracelessness is just so they can't track us. It's crazy how that didn't work, though. I mean, because it was a really smart plan. Maybe we can go under it. Is it far away? It's like 15 feet from us you said? Is it farther than that? Sure. The depth of the wall? Good idea, Grog. I'll definitely try it. Which are definitely used... Wait. To teleport things? Oh my god, if the ritual finishes, they can teleport this whole fucking city. Shit. We have to stop this. I don't know. Yeah, but I don't think it's safe to touch those things. I don't remember. I don't have any in my bag. You did? Matt's like, uh... No, that doorway is in no way safe. Yeah, and all the flying creatures are going to see us immediately. We either go under the wall... How far from the wall to the tower is it? Does it seem? Can we see the tower through the doorway? A mile to the tower? So it's probably two miles wide, this whole...? Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. What if we go under the ground all the way to the tower? From within a building. Can we be zombie cows? Don't you think the flying guys will notice that? Yeah. Can I-- Shit, well, you already rolled. Can I have been keeping an eye on the sky and give her a go ahead when it looks like they're not going to see her? Just go. Just fucking go. Hey, guys, we didn't eat a Heroes' Feast yet, either. I'm not going to look at him. It's like in school, if you don't make eye contact, maybe they won't call on you. We all are dead. She has to duck down. Yeah. So do you have protection? Do you have something you could turn into? Yeah, but he's in front of you. Ask him if he has any money, and ask him if he can make a good dinner because I'm hungry. Good job, Scanlan. Yes. Benjamin is what I'm thinking. I don't think we have time to stop. Pike can heal us, but we can't rest. There's no time for a rest. No time for a Heroes' Feast. I bought those fucking chalices. I think that thing is like, going to go. I wonder if Delilah's on the top of the tower. Can't you make all of us invisible? By anything. Does it look like there's any windows on the tower, or is just a big old Rapunzel tower? Okay. Well, hold on. 19. Ultimate challenge for Vox Machina. Yeah, let's get in a building and hide! The thing that's glowing is off of the ground of the tower? Inside! Inside! Oh hey! We were sent here by Delilah Briarwood. You may know her. Right. The ritual that's happening on top of the tower. How long until that thing's done? Blink once for 15 minutes. Blink twice for an hour or more. Yeah, do you know? Blink once for yes, blink twice for no. No, that was an hour, at least! What if we burn the fucking city down? I mean, if they're planning on transporting this whole fucking city, and setting an army loose on our world, why don't we just burn the whole fucking city down? Destroy their rations. Destroy their weapons! You did your hand signal for Arnold Palmer. Arnold Palmer? No, really, do you know anything about the ritual? Do you know if it's going to be over soon? Please, we know you're going to transport to another plane. Oh my god, he was going to leave. So, but, set fire to the house, right? Burn the whole city down? Let's poison the water supply! It's an hour. It takes an hour, right? The pulse has gotten stronger since we've been here. I don't know if that pulse means it's about to go, or if the pulse means that it's five minutes in. He was handing out weapons. Technical terms. Yeah, I could use 20 points. What? Oh that's a one, not seven, isn't it? That's fine, that's fine! Well, while they fly up, is it enough time for the people staying in the house to heal a bit? How come we didn't ever see those before; is that a new wood? I want it! Oh god. I think you're out of range, so you don't get the plus ten anymore. I already did it. If we had had a Feast, we'd have advantage on this. 24. Did we feel that (whoosh) within the building? What'd you see? That's where I figured she'd be. Can I run out and look at the tower and see if the orb looks different? Fuck. Well, we should fucking get up there, then, huh? Did you see Delilah up there? And the ringleader was still standing? So easy. Even one with that fucking wall she had last time, we're fucked. We didn't do any research on that wall, did we? That spell? Did anybody do any research on that spell that we saw her do? Down in the ziggurat? I like the idea of bringing it down. It's a tough call. Twice in a row? I have a siege arrow. What if we weaken the outside and then hit with the earthquake? Well, Delilah's still up there, so if she falls at least she takes some damage. Wisdom saving throws are major. She could take control of us. Yeah, but you can be taken control of with your brain, Grog. I just don't feel like there's time, honestly. Oh, that would have been way easier. Oh, it's probably magically protected. That is very true. Maybe we can prepare the Feast, keep an eye out. If we have to ditch out on the Feast early, then we do. We got to go. 35 to 40 people? Let's kill 'em all on the way up. They're trying to come over into our territory. I don't like it. They're all assholes. And a couple people with wings. Oh god, the creepy music is starting. We gotta go, y'all. It's Delilah. She's going to destroy us. Do we have any way to neutralize her magic? Are there a lot of gloom stalkers around? Wait a minute. Did the orb at the top turn the same way that the orbs in the ziggurat turn? Oh, and then times two. Oh, yeah, if you have that spell going, you can do other things in case things attack us? Get up as close as we can to support Pike and Keyleth. Yes. This is stupid as fuck! Yes, focus it on one side of the tower. Both on the same side. We're going to get close enough so that they can do their 500 feet distance. But keep a distance to the tower. We're going to try to get in a building that's closer to the tower. -- need that anymore. Maybe just drop it and we'll be cultists. Yeah, and then the one, the guy that we just killed in front of the -- Yeah! That's good! Yeah, we'll just robe it up. I think that was already there, yeah. Does everybody have their arms, that we've run into so far? Or are they missing an arm, too? An eye and an arm or just an eye? Okay. I guess so. So exciting. Oh, don't. Ditto. I think he bought it. I think we played it really cool there, guys. I want to keep an eye out for buildings, too. 23. The aliens are coming and we're welcoming them. We're getting ready to teleport. We're in the north. There's a lot of places that snow. It could be Draconia. There's a lot of places that snow. Is it winter in Wildemount right now? Fucking get into the building that we can, and then start it. Eff that shit. Just do it. To the end. Do it. Can we see who it is? Let's go. This sounds like we're all going to die! Okay. I take off the robes. Get ready. Slow motion walk towards the tower. Well, no. They know we're here. Surround the tower, climb up each side? I'll broom it. You're a dipshit! It's 35 feet up, so. You can hop on my broom. I don't know if he's actually here yet. I feel like whenever we come across a map, I feel like we walked into his hand, exactly where he wanted us. Me and Keyleth-- do you want to land over here? As soon as I land, I bamf Trinket out. Keep a distance, don't be in a line with us. They've been peed on?! Bitchface Briarwood. Oh no, what's flying? No, I don't need it! Oh no! What is that? My teeth hurt. I mean, it's a normal amount of time. I have no plan! Fully. Leeroy Jenkins! 18. Ooh, nice! This first round is definitely a surprise attack on them, right? We knew we were going to say it. I have a feeling I have to roll really high against fucking Vecna! Oh yeah, Tary had Luck, not Scanlan. Because he's going to cancel it. Oh god, you have to roll so high in order to resist. You skipped me. And I rolled a 20. We slow-motion walked into our own death. Walls brought down. What does being held mean? T minus ten minutes until he turns into a goldfish. That's plenty of time for us to die. Oh, good! Of our destruction? Of our doom? Hope you're wearing underwear, bitch, because he just looked up your skirt! (small voice) Me? No! Why would you do this?! How you do dis Matt?! No! Natural 20! (cheering) Oh, I'm really glad we healed. Ow, ow. (whimpering) I'm good. They could just attack us until we die. Do you have mass Restoration? I don't think she can fix it. Mass Anti-hold. Thanks, dragon armor! God, we've got to roll like a 27 in order to break it! A 20 didn't break it, so yeah. A natural 20. Yeah. Wait! Oh, I thought that was ten. On being held? She rolled a 27. There's nowhere-- We're gonna die. 21. 72. It's such an anti-climactic fight because none of us can do anything. On concentration? What does that even mean? Hey, Scanlan! Mind Fire! You've got this! Oh, yeah. This is one of the ones we tried a long time ago. Stop making eye contact. Look down! He's really good at evil monologuing. 38 to Trinket? She's like, ooh. That was his legendary. I like that you have an enlarged figure Grog. That's cool. I like that you made an enlarged figure for Grog. Oh my god, this map is so pretty. (laughter) Whatever it is, it's really cool. Magic can't put me to sleep. I'm dead. Insta-full death? Hey, don't compliment the map, you guys. Matt really doesn't like it. No body left? Bro. We're gone. I thought this campaign was going to last longer than this. You're not disintegrated? We don't know. You've rolled shit on that dice every time tonight. Yeah. He can't do anything. Trinket can't still attack if I'm not alive. He rolled a seven. Yeah, he might go into the pocket dimension. And Trinket takes how much necrotic damage? It wouldn't have mattered. Wildemount, or some shit. Okay. Do whatever you want. Pike. Are they dead? You're mixing him with your suude? I haven't seen Vax yet. I haven't seen what happened. For Percy to get there. Can you come back down to the ground? What does it look like when you're looking out at all of us and we're so sad? He'll be a god in our next damn campaign when we're all dead. It's because I called him a dipshit when he was talking earlier. He is a dipshit. Before he does his cantrip, I'm going to go, you can go ahead and live forever, but you'll still be fucking ugly the whole damn time! (laughter) To my armor class? He doesn't hit. Destroyed me. It's red. All flashing red. Matthew, don't do it! Is that a natural 20? And you're below 100? You're inspired! Inspired. Use it! It wasn't Power Word Kill, it was Finger of Death? Just the one. Just the one Power Word Kill. No. We can go to the pond. Other bits of concentration. (laughing) I get to go? Oh yeah, we did. I know. This is the first thing I've done. I stand up. I'm going to, as a bonus action, down my biggest healing potion, which is one greater healing potion. No. It's in your armor. 13 plus four is 17 healing points, and I'm going to move closer to Keyleth. Can I put myself in between Percy and Keyleth so I can reach my hand out? We're all in a clump, so we can still touch? I don't need to move anywhere in order to be able to touch her? Okay, I'm going to shoot at the death knight. With my 21? With my Blazing Bowstring, and I want to make it a bramble shot. Is anybody standing next to him? Sweet. 23 plus eight is 31, right? 33 plus 1d6 lightning damage. 39, and then 3d6 sneak attack. 11 additional, so that's-- Oh, and the Blazing Bowstring. Six additional from that. Not surprising. What about his concentration? No, I get to attack him again. That one definitely hits. This is way less damage. 20 damage on the second one. Keyleth, get us out of here? Where's Vax? No. Yeah, but then we'll be able to recover a little bit and figure out what we're doing. Or heal us. And you're holding your action, Keyleth? What? What did you just think of? 26 is great. You're nothing! You're nobody! What's he doing? But her armor! 6d6 fire damage! All hostile. That was terrible! Yeah, we're just waiting on you to make the touch. And you're saving your action until we're all touching? Oh, I thought you were saving your action. What is this game, Matthew? Don't do it! I need Taco Bell right now in my life! Scanlan's back. Where's Vax? And we would have been gone. If he can't move, he's fucked. Vecna is out and ready to fucking destroy.
