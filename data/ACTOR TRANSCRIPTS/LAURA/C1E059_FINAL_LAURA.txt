Astral projection! Do we get to do this? We haven't opened any of these yet. Oh, this is super cool! We may or may not do voices in Fullmetal Alchemist and Dragon Ball Z. You got a poster? Oh, there is a poster! Oh, and little cell phone charms! Sorry Liam, you're missing out. I'll save you a cell phone charm. And they're feathers! Actually, Liam, these are really appropriate. They're feathers. I'll save you one! I didn't even know they had an Anime Loot Crate. That's pretty cool. Oh, the t-shirt competition! Okay. So we have officially selected the top three of our choosing, and then we are now presenting them to you guys to vote on. They are already up on geekandsundry.com, so go and check them out and make your votes heard, and we're going to be announcing the actual winner of the t-shirt competition at our live show next week, so everybody that comes and sees that will get to see a picture of it live. Just like you guys at home. That 30 seconds makes a huge difference. The amount of texts that went back and forth between all of us, trying to decide what the top three were going to be, was really-- No, that's not true. No! It was pretty fun. Oh shit, Grog. Already? Well, I have no idea how to get our bearings here, unfortunately. Perhaps it might be wise to move quietly. Brilliant. It's very dangerous, and I'm afraid they don't understand. (whispering) Will-o'-wisps. 20. Maybe. Can I climb a tree? Close by. Athletics. Can I use my acrobatics to hop up? Ooh! Swing myself? Parkour? Acrobatics, with disadvantage? 24. Oh no! I should've saved it! (laughs) Nope! Time is different in the Feywild. What? Yes? That's why I'm staying in the trees, brother. I will if it looks safe. Does it look safe? Can I see from my height, can I see a better view of the ruins and everything? Oh! And this is forest, right? TALIESIN and You sneaky. Here we go. I got 25 on my perception. Do I see any life forms around? Does this look similar to the pool that was on the other side of the portal? I wouldn't know? I come down and I watch as Keyleth makes a stupid move. Don't pick anything. There was something in the water on the other side of the ruins. I'm not lying. We should probably hide! 29. What happened? Did she say anything? Grog! Did you recognize that woman? You didn't see the naked woman come up over that wall? I come down out of the tree. Can you just be quiet for two seconds? (shushing) Grog. There was a naked woman. In a pool. That reminded me of maybe the pool on the other side. We were jumping over from close to that portal, right? Could it be the nymph that you stole the heart of? Would it be safe for you to see her again and maybe ask for her to cure our friend here or would you-- Is she dangerous to be around? What'd she do to you? Well, I worry if we go try to talk to her if it's not her, then she could blind all of us. Percival, would you like something to hold onto as you walk? Yes, of course. I pop Trinket out. Hi, buddy! Trinket, we're in a very weird place. A weird place. Things can happen. Trinket, can you help Percival walk? He's blind. She's back in Whitestone. Now don't walk him into any trees, Trinket dear. Don't touch anything. She jumped over the wall here. I can try. It's right past the ruins. Right there, darling, can't you see? Grog, do you want to give it a go? Just go see if it's her? Be quiet-- okay. She went in the water, Grog. She was in the water before. I'll come with you to the water. Hey. Does this look like the pool you came into on the other side? Remember her name? Scanlan! Whisper to Grog what to say to draw a lady out. You're very charismatic. And repeat what you hear Scanlan say. Use your earring! Pike! It's been five fucking minutes. You missed the naked chick! There's a naked chick. She blinded Percival with her beauty. We all get down on a knee. How does it work? I bet Pike has a few tricks up her sleeve. Yes, actually. We all are. Have you heard tale of a sick tree? Something very cancerous on the land. This one holds a bow at its heart. In a bog. Something about glass? I just started a page on the Feywild and now it's already-- there it is. Wow. Sounds lonely. I have a book on me. Would you like it? Well. I basically have it memorized at this point, I've read it so many times. That'll be 30 gold. (laughter) 50 gold. Thank you. What were those little colored lights that disappear as we get close? Do they lead you anywhere? I was wondering if you have any sort of-- you're very well-versed with this area. Any form of protection you could offer us or recommend to us as we move forward in this confusing land? 26. Maybe Grog? Oh. Well, that's true. Oh, that's attractive. How's it feel? (laughter) Of your realm. Yeah, we do that, too. Be honest. You totally (tongue click). Did you? Did you get it on with her? All right. Oh, that's right, you didn't have a beard before! Toward the Shademirk. I don't know if he needs it. (stage whisper) It's okay, Trinket. Well, you know. That's how it goes. He is one of our sharpshooters, thank you very much. It really would. Hey, I want to heal you! All right? How long has he been working on that? Give it a go. Trinket, come here! Yay! Can we start moving forward? Yeah, we leave them. Perception check. 27. I feel like I remember hearing that the time here is very strange. Maybe it moves slower here. I don't know. Does it feel like we're moving forward? Do you think it's safe if I fly up and look at the sky? I'm going to try flying up. All right, I'm going to try flying up above the canopy. I'm assuming I'm not in the forest anymore, right? 17. Flickering. Do I see any sign of a city? The sky looks the same? Well, at least we know we've made some headway. I go back down. There's a tree line, at least. I think we should reach it soon. Right. We're not out of the tree line yet? Hello? Is somebody there? Ooh! Natural 20. (stage whisper) Did anybody else see that? Okay, cool. Did it look childlike or adultlike? Oh. Okay. Just be ready. Behind us. I saw you! Did you want to say hello? All right. I guess we'll have fun over here without you. Laugh like I told a really funny joke. (forced laughter) So funny. Anything? That's true. Do you guys want to ride Trinket and see? Do you still have Barkskin? Nice. Oh! As we're walking, first question do I see any form of path through this grass? The flicker of light I saw in the distance. Are we going to intersect it in the direction that we're going? Okay, so I'll keep an eye in that direction as we move forward, but I want to talk to you, Keyleth. I've been trying to find out a way to talk to Trinket like I know you can, right? I was wondering if maybe you could teach me how to do that? Do you think that's possible? Okay! I have a spell slot available for Speak With Animals that I never claimed that I want to learn. I will definitely keep that in mind. I let her do that, and I'm going to keep walking normally. I'm learning so much. Can I walk up to Trinket and say Hey, buddy. Can you understand me? Yeah! Do you understand me? (screams) I hug him so hard! Oh my gosh! Could you understand me all the time? Oh, darling, but now I understand you, and it's wonderful! Okay, quick question. Do you mind being in my necklace, or does it bother you? What's it like? Is it terrible? Because I don't want to do it if you hate it. No, you haven't. Okay. Well, that's good. Well, I basically wanted to say that I love you so much. (sobbing) I start crying! Oh, this is the best spell ever! I can't believe I didn't know it before! Trinket! Thanks, Keyleth! Thanks, buddy. You can? Wait, you can? Cool. It's like when your dog comes in the room when you're peeing. It's a little awkward at first when you hear about it, but it's fine. It's okay. I'm fine with it. Whatever. If you understood what he was saying, which you don't! For a while, as long as my spell lasts, I want to keep talking to Trinket and catch up on old times. Oh, right. That was so good, right? I love the Feywild. We're walking. Do we feel tired? There was that kid that we talked to. There was a creature in the woods. I saw it. We have food. We're on our way. Two days duskward. See? Two days. Two days. It's two days. Yeah. When we feel tired-- I do want to make sure that nothing's following us on occasion, and make sure that nothing is around. We'll get separated. 18. We are heading towards something. I'm not sure what it is. What else are we going to do? Can I fly up on the broom and see if I can see anything in the field around us or look for any movement in the grass? I put my fucking hat on. And me? 25. Oh, whispers! Whispers! He's been chewing on that, just so you know. In addition to that, do I see anything in the grass around us? Can I fly down near it? Does he see me? I want to float down above him on the broom and lay down on the broom and say What are you drawing? Nothing at all? On those people up there? Oh. Interesting. Why not? You know, you probably could get a better view of them if you were riding on this broom. I'm not looking. I'm not falling for that! Nope! Can I insight check him and see? 16? I'm not going to bite you. Can I fly down and grab his wrist and fly up? Oh, okay. Athletics? Oh, great. 15? Now I spin around and see if there's anything behind me. Sneaky little fuck! It really is. I think we should go say hi to my friends, don't you? We're in need of company, dear. And we fly down. Hello to everyone. Well, look at this friend I just found! Gentle, Grog. Gentle. What are you? Don't squeeze him, Grog. No reading, just drawing. Percy! Our friend Percival here, he likes to draw, as well. Garmelie, I saw what you were drawing, and it was quite lovely. Don't you want to share? There's nothing wrong with drawing a funny picture. I love them. Honestly, I think you're quite talented. Where do your clothes come from? Where do you live? So you know this area quite well. So you could potentially guide us? Grog! Be nice to our guest. I have a deal for you. We could offer you-- Dinner! Delicious dinner. Chicken. Have you ever had chicken? It's so wonderful. If you happen to lead us where we want to go. We'll tell you in a little bit. I fly off, and I go grab the quill. I didn't even make it into the square. It was pathetic. 27? Grog, let him go. Grog, put him down and put your hand on his shoulder. Let's hold hands as we walk through the door. Oh shit, we can talk about that? My talent includes taming otters. I wish. No, that's my other stupid talent. But I wanted an excuse to have an otter here. Oh, it was magical. 22k and a red panda! That's not official. 25k and a talent show, though, is real. I don't want any badly poached animals taken from their environment. I know, that was terrible. Is there a carpet here? Just a picnic? I would have a picnic with you, darling. Why don't we eat, and we'll get to the questions in a little bit? Let's give him a rest. I shocked him when I abducted him. I would like some of that, as well, Grog. Can I pull Vax aside for a moment and ask Do you want to go to Syngorn? We could avoid it. Right. Of course. We should go see them. Of course, why wouldn't I? Please. And I walk back to the group. Keyleth, that's a bit forward. Can I have some more ale, as well, Grog? Keep it coming, all around. Acquire what? Do you steal, darling? It certainly will. I searched for it! Was it a special quill? I'm sorry. The Shademirk. There's a very scary tree there. What do you know about the Shademirk? Do you have drawings? Have you drawn things from there? Garmelie, that creature. Is it very large? Oh shit. Well, we'll protect you. Have you heard of a very large-- well, I don't know if it's large. A very scary tree there? Something poisoning the land? I've got no problem stealing from any of those people. The Feywild. Slippery. Sneaky. If we can't steal the things, then the deal is off. Well, I trust you, Percy, if you think it's smart. Did you do it? I have no love for that city. I don't care. Ultimately, I would love to ask them to help us in our fight. They're cowardly and stupid for hiding, but we could use their help if they're making an army. They did? Of course they did. They're a city. We had a fight instructor when we were growing up. I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry. I looked for 20 fucking minutes. I looked, all right? No, it is really nice! I know you're acting like he's lying, but he's telling the fucking truth. Sure, why not. Me? I'm pretty sure he was talking to me, actually. Why should we avoid the hut? What does Wodenna do? She's a hag? Is she a hag? Maybe we should move him to a safe location that we can lock. Maybe some sort of magical thing that he put on me, because I'm pretty sure he cast something on me and my brother. A shiver. When we shook his hand. Can we try it? On me and my brother, see if it cancels out whatever he just did? Everything I'm wearing is magic. What is it about this dimension that makes us get naked all the time? Thank you. So I take off everything except for the hat. Do I feel anything? I'm definitely putting my clothes back on. Lock the door. No, not anymore. That is really creepy. I get very little sleep. I'm having trouble sleeping. Oh jeez. Wow. I'm going to get up early and try to fix my hair and make it as pristine as I can and try to clean off my clothes and everything before we go. Percy was charmed. Yes? Before we made the deal with him? Fuck, Percy! I made the deal because you said it was fine! It's fine. You didn't know. Well. It's our own stupid fault. We knew we weren't supposed to trust anything here. Why did you want to fix his whistle? You just liked him. Damn it. I thought you knew something we didn't know. I really thought you did. Percy. Change of subject. Would you say I look put together? Well off? With this armor. Well, you come from money, right? Right, so do I look like I come from money? (laughs) I don't believe that. No? Well, you know. Everyone. We were judged, growing up, and I don't look forward to seeing that again. It's not important. (laughs) (laughs) I like the way you think. Thank you, Percy. Will you stay at my side when we're there? (laughs) All right. Good night. We'll sort out this charmed mess in the morning. That sounds so good. This picture is disgusting. I flick his head. Well, it's gross, but everybody else looks quite wonderful. I do think we should inform you, though, we may have used a little magic on you. Sorry. Just to make sure the deal was solid. You're going to walk us right in. That's not sneaky at all. I fully trust you. I hate him now. What sort of magic did you cast on us? What was the deal we agreed to? What will happen if it breaks? Yeah, we fucked that up, didn't we? That was amazing, Pike. I don't think I've ever seen anyone play an instrument that well. Oh, that's terrible. Poor guy. We are really shit at making friends. He's going to show us. It's going to disappear as soon as we take it out! Leave it in the mansion. That way it'll stay. No, there's no way we could sneak in. With what? He has some fancy cloaks, unless he's used them all. Can't you craft something to keep the rain off of us? Perception check? See if I can see anything moving ahead of us? 29. Garmelie? What are these? Let's leave it. What's this? This is not woods anymore? This is not forest? Is this marsh? 21. I take my hood down. You know us. We're here to see my father. The twins. Vex'ahlia and Vax'ildan. Do we know who she is? We came to speak to our father. 14. I'll stop using that one tonight. Can you still feel him? Oh, sorry. Watcher Iova. Nice to see you have elevated yourself. No. I would expect nothing less. I guess we should probably make our way straight to-- so we can have free rein. Shit. I guess you just have to fly in next week, too! Well, that's okay. It says Spoon. That's our dad's stupid last name. (Dragon Ball Z war cry) There we go.
