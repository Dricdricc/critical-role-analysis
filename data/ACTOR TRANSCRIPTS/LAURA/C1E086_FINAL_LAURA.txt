We even ordered a lot this time, but we're out. Well, maybe they'll roll something extra special later. I don't know. We do still have bracelets. We do still have pins. We do still have a few socks left. We still have shirts! We have Gilmore shirts. We have a few-- We have Strongjaw shirts! Are you wearing yours? No. There's our Critical Role logo shirt! All these shirts are still available in the store! This is Strong-- this is a strong jaw. That's all I got. We gotta stop. Yay! Yaaay! What kind of Viking are you? The raider. That's yesterday. Our Valentine's Day consisted of me making chili and then us going to Menchie's. Yup! It was a gooood Valentine's Day. Yeah. Here we go. Here we go. That's right. Gulp gulp gulp gulp! You're amazing. Yeah! That's his name. Taryon Darrington. We agreed to bring him along because he's paying us. That is an important fact. Scribbles! Our leader isn't with us right now.  Well, that's us-- -- promise keepers. Yes, dear.  Grog. I believe. Or maybe, unless you meant to say me and you said Vax. Because why would Vax have anything, I'm the one with the bag of colding. Vaaax. Just ignore him, really. How about that?  Grog--  Shall we bust it out here or do you want to talk in private? Should I dig into the bag of holding?  Okay, I'm just gonna reach in the bag of holding and pull out the hand. Oh yeah! It's good. Oh, that's right, I put the regular hand-- did we? You wouldn't even. You don't want to see in there. Sure! She was a strange woman. Giant balls. Yeah, his I'm not sure of-- Thank you, Treev. We're out.  We got our lives. Magic. Pure magic. Sure. Really? Missile snaring! Yeah? Wildmount! You're from Wildmount. Wildmount, hm? Yeah. I haven't been no. No. She's quite all right. She always does. Right, as you do. Right. Mm-hm. Oh God! Did you purchase that armor all on your own as well, or did Mommy and Daddy buy it for you? That's good. (quietly) He's such an ass. Ooh! Really? It's funny, that whole list... it seems like we've done all of it. Yeah. Five? Six? Something like that. Ancient dragons Deadly. It's weird, you look older, but you act younger. I suppose. I would love to hear. I want to keep an eye-- I'm keeping an eye out for any kind of questionable behavior. (quietly) God damn it. I know, right? 17. I thought we already did, the Daring Adventures of-- All right. That one seems appropriate. Oh. Classic. Oh, wow. His money. Hey, Tary. How much money do you have in your account right now? In your account. You can whisper it in my ear. Here's what I need to know. Are you full of shit and you don't actually have any money, or do you have enough to pay our fee? It looks like it did, but for all I know you spent all your money on it. How about you just show me some money, and that way we can be sure. All right. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Just a whole bag of that? I want to look at one. Don't. Flick. Money at me. Dear. If you want to keep your hands. Is this--? Does it look real? I'm gonna use my gold dice for this. It makes sense. Ah, fuckin' A. That's only 15. All right. Lovely. I believe you. Congratulations on being born into privilege. It was just completed, didn't you notice? It happened right under your eyes. Mysterious, isn't it?  And I walk away. We just did it! We completed it! Yeah, no. We need to do that. Audition who? What are you talking about? Oh! (laughs) Yeah, right. Impressive. I thought you only learned Gs. You didn't actually pay for anything. You haven't paid. Like, most boring day ever now that Tary's here, we don't do anything fun at all. We all sit down and start knitting. (laughs) Do some grocery shopping. Fassbender was bigger, right? It is a good word. Is anyone following us from the Scarbearers? I like your face more than your antlers, but both are nice, dear. I just wanted to ask Tary. So your... Doty? Yes? Dottie, sorry. Duty. Got it. Does he fight or does he just write? Is he competent in a battle? Has he ever been in battle? Does he look like he has any battle scars? All right, just doing some-- (yells) No no no, at least it's not a one. 20. Duty looks... worn. Doty, my apologies. He looks worn. Old, far older than your armor. I can see that about you. You seem very dexterous too. Yes. Did Doty raise you? Is he like your nanny? That you made when you were two? Because he looks like he raised you. How old were you when you built him? Yes? He's a year old? And he only talks to you? Oh, he only listens to you. Aw. No, it's not! Don't use luck! You can-- Yes. Question the symbol? Scanlan? That's what I thought. Did he give back to us or did he not? Remember the symbol that had-- Yeah, that doesn't have his symbol on it though. J'mon Sa Ord. Of course, be pleased! Um. Well, could I take you aside for a moment? We have in our service, in Emon, a wonderful man, who has been of great aid in battling the Conclave as well, and we learned recently that he was expelled from Marquet due to crimes in his youth and was wondering if we could maybe speak in his name and his regard, to you, to clear his name? Jarett. His last name? Jarett... Jarett Howorth? Jarett Howarth. Of course she does, because she takes killer notes. Yes. Thank you so much. If you find out anything, will you please send word? If you could, send it to Whitestone? That would be wonderful. It's an up and coming city. Very prominent on Tal'dorei. It's on the move. Totally fine. Thank you so much. Be pleased. Welp. Probably. Lots of travel happening. Happens when you travel, I hear. Oh jeez. So many. All of them. Very big numbers, Grog. Yeah. Shouldn't we see him fight first? I'd hate for him to die immediately. No, not in the city, Grog. I know. Hey! You know what you can cross off your list? Teleportation, because that's what we're about to do. Oh yeah. I know. That's exactly what it was like. Or it was like walking forward. What time is it here? Okay. Oh, fabulous. All right. Oh, can I go find Jarett really fast? Hi. How are you mentally? It is quite nice. Well, you're welcome to stay. We are planning to rebuild our home in Emon as well. So it's up to you where you'd like to be. I do too. Well, in case you're wondering, we just came from Marquet. Where we spoke with the Grand Maven? Of J'mon Sa Ord. Spoke very highly of you and she's working on getting your name cleared. Well, she said she would. I don't know what you did, dear, but hopefully it wasn't anything too terrible. See home? That's nice. Of course. And you may not have heard, but our resident bard has left us. Possibly for the time being, possibly for more. So you won't be seeing his face around here. I only tell you because I saw you speaking with him several times and thought you might want to know. Of course. What is it? Requested? What is it? Components of a potion? I don't... What is it, Jarrett? It's drugs? I put it in my pocket. Don't do drugs! Scanlan was doing drugs? Jarett, you sold Scanlan drugs? Is this why you were expelled from Marquet? How long have you been providing this to him? Yes, he is. He is. When was the first time you gave it to him? Thank you. Thank you for giving them to me. I understand. I appreciate your service, Jarrett. Get better. Keep training. All right. Is it deception? You can! I feel like Grog is getting far more trustworthy. Oh my gosh! Why do you want a natural 20?! You're going to kill him! This is true! This is smart. You're so smart! Oh, that's cool. Ooh! Hey! Am I there? Well, I was coming from talking to Jarrett so, it's up to you if I'm there yet. Am I walking up as it's happening? Nope. Oh shit! Oh, God. (gasps) Where am I on my walk up? Can I hear this going on? Take off running. As fast as I can get there-- The way I know to get there the-- Would it be faster to go up-- Broom up and over? Into the courtyard. Let's do that. Okay. I make sure I take off my hat. Can I cannonball Trinket into the middle of it? Not at Taryon, at my party. What the fuck is happening? I step away for five seconds and everybody's at war. Can I land? (all laugh) Yeah, I think we're fine here, Trinket. You made him cry? What the fuck happened? Tary, you could die. Oh, we're ready. Oh, Tary. Oh, careful there, it'll leave a bruise. Ahh, this guy. Not so much. No no no. He's my pet. What? Yeah, but I really am a little worried he's gonna die in the Nine Hells. Isn't there somewhere a little less scary we can take him? Oh no, I like him! Damn it. Nobody likes a dick. Well. There it is. Do you have any wine in your bag of holding? I know, I just want to taste his wine. No, but seriously, was he your nanny? It's okay if he was. I just want to know. We'd like you more. If you're honest. No, that's really wonderful. So you want to be an actor. You could be a philanthropist. A lot of times they do. Hide behind your giant robot. Stay clear if what you do is cast spells. Don't get up in the fray. (laughs) Let's go get a drink. What, like knock him unconscious? I didn't see any of it, so I'm not sure. (laughs) Grog! Stop. (laughs) That's all we do. So dark. SO DARK! Whatever you need, dear. Oh. Right. Well, we won't, obviously, if you don't want us to, Pike. 'Course. Pike. I step away with her. (all laugh) I understand. Oh, good. All right. All right. I give her a big hug, and I whisper in her ear. You don't always have to put on a brave face, dear. (exhales) First one goes, then the other. (sighs) Gnomeless. It's a fair question. Did you really get them killed? Can I insight check him? Natural 20. All right. What's my sister's name? You don't know! Mary-Anne Darrington. Marion Darrington. Oh... Howard Darrington. Oh... Big one. Yeah. I keep filling up Grog's mug, to make sure he gets his fill. Huh? I think it's great. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. He's weird? I don't know. No. Nobody is. Yes you do. Yes, it was. Darling, this wasn't part of the deal. No contract stipulations when we made the deal, therefore, you pay full price, darling. A check? Oh, dear lord. I know how bags of holding work. No, I mean, I wasn't there to witness it, I just know your normal voice. I heard this braying. I thought it was a goat, actually. Oh. A lot of people talk about that. Fabulous. Oh, I like that. Bidet. Grog, how ragey are you right now? Super ragey? It feels very strange for you two to be agreeing. I just want to know if he's all right. It should be parchment, shears. He might know. Danger-zone. I swear. Mm. Um. Why, no, Percival. As we leave, I turn to Grog. And I think about talking to him for just a second, and then I leave the room. Pike asked us not to. Yeah, we can go down to the docks. Are there docks here? Yeah, it would be Emon. Yeah, Emon is the place to go to. Thanks, Matt. Did they come back here? Ooh! Shame you. Maybe somebody at the docks in Emon would know? I wanna just pay off that docks comment, really. (all laugh) Let's go! Ooh. And I wanna talk to Grog. How are you? Yeah! Yeah. Feeling less rage-y? That's good, that's good. Okay. Hey, so... This is difficult for me to do. Did you know that Scanlan had acquired drugs? Did you? I just found this out, that he was using drugs behind our back. I think so, I mean, I've never tried them, but-- So, I don't know, finding out secrets about people doesn't feel good. Feeling like they've broken your trust in some way, right? And being trustworthy is very important. Right. So. Just hold on. Ah. I pull out the deck. So, this is-- Do you know what this is? Do you remember this? Okay. So, Grog, I have to be honest with you. When you asked me for this before, I lied. To you. Yeah. Well, I sort of tricked you and thought it'd be funny if I gave you maybe the wrong thing. To see if you'd notice! But-- I'm still lying. I didn't-- I was afraid-- I gave you a false deck. You wanna pull it out? Well, you're still not supposed to, technically. Do you want me to pull it out? Should I-- Should you-- Do you just-- Yeah, maybe close your eyes and get the deck out. (all laugh) All right, I am taking it from your hand. These ones are-- Grog! Open your eyes. It's not really a deck, you see? It's a bag. With rocks in it. No. You gave that to Scanlan. Here's your deck. Still don't use it, still don't look at it, it's still very dangerous! But I want you to know that I trust you with it. Oh, good, then still don't, how about that? I know, basically, I just-- No! I don't know. No no no! Don't-- Grog! You're making me regret giving this back to you right now. I just want to say. I close it. Please don't make me regret this. I'm sorry that I lied to you. Even though you didn't notice. I want you to know you can still trust me, and I can still trust you to not fuck with this. Sure. Grog? You're a good person. Still don't look at the deck. I'm glad you have our back. Don't do drugs. What do you mean 'the rest of the drugs'? Right. Should we search his room? Let's do it. Yeah. Oh! 16 for me as well. TRAVIS and He took them with him! Oh, nudey pictures. (laughs) Yeah. Well, I guess he took them with him. Like, never, Grog. Well, I heard from Percival that they're super, super dangerous. But I don't know what they do. No, I don't. Not today, how about that? All right. Oh my god! Yeah. Are we going to Emon? No. We're going to the earth-- the earth people. Let's go! (laughs) Terrible. She's a half orc. Rockcaller--? Not that I would know that. Must wreak havoc on the local architexture. Architexture. Shut your mouth, you wouldn't even know what architecture is! (quietly) Tight. Can I ask a question? Is that all right? Is it polite? (quietly) Hi, sorry. You mentioned that the water Ashari live under the water. Okay, I thought maybe they were like mer-people or something, I wasn't sure. Yeah, right? That'd be really cool. Cool. So we'll see them above land then if we're flying. Some of them. All right, that was my question. Thank you for your answer. Thank you. Always. Kai... tiaki. Kamehameha. Why are your vocal cords covered in dirt? Why on earth would you eat dirt? Can we Treestride again today? Ooh, I like it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and we got one. We can be regular pirates now. (gasps) Pirate gear! No. I imagine you saying all that as you touch the tree. Wow, that was fast. Oh, I hope Captain Damon's all right. He's so dreamy. The perfect scar. He's got the-- no, he's got the Harrison Ford. Yeah. That was a good one. Find a good crew. Let's go to the docks, you guys. Today. I'll go. 19? Oh, by one! Yes. We are-- I don't know if you've noticed, but the city has just been saved. Yes, then you maybe saw us in the fray, and now, after saving this beautiful city, we are on our way to the middle of the fucking sea. Would somebody be able to take us? No. To rent a crew of well-seasoned sailors who know their way around the ocean. Sure, darling. We're looking to charter a ship. I just learn so much from you, you know? Take over. Well, just very close to Hespit, actually, not far so-- very far southwest-- Forgive my brother, he gets very embarrassed when he talks about how much we've saved. Humble creature. Oh, well I wasn't, of course not. Understandable. We're looking to charter a ship, full of sailors, who can get us to a circular reef to the southwest, near the Hespit. Captain Adella. Thank you so much, Dockmaster. Wonderful. Percy, do we tip him? I don't know how this works. Oh, all right. Oh, that's it? We don't even need that. Dock pretzels. That was so gross. Oh my god. Oh my god. Wow. We could seriously buy a ship. I mean we have no need for a ship. I know, right? We've gotta be frugal, even though we don't have to be, we should be. Exactly. All right. Why, yes we are! I assume you're Captain Adella. Yes, it does. Dockmaster Abban speaks very highly of you. Do you know your way around the Ozmit? Near the Hespit Sea? Near the Hespit? I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Ish. It's near the Hespit, not quite-- Oh! Perfect. Goodness gracious. How worth our while are you thinking? How many crew-- 12-man crew? No, I think that's a fair price. Honestly, I feel... Bandit ships? We're weapons. How often do sea monsters sprout up on you? Ever? I've never been on the sea. Really? Well yeah, not like in it. You own boat shoes. Do we need anything? Do we need anything before we do-- Let's do it! Do you think that Raven's Slumber is waterproof? All right. I would hate to-- little baby, mini Trinket in there gets like drowned or something if I'm underwater. Exactly. Or the bathtub. I wanna sleep on the ship! How many beds do you have on that ship? Bunks? Or rooms? I mean, obviously you don't have rooms for-- Oh. All right. No, it's totally doable. Let's just go. I know! Almost. So close! I'll most likely kill you in the morning.
