Wait a minute. What is this Injustice 2 you speak of? I watched a video today of you and you fighting, which was pretty exciting. That's crazy. I play Supergirl! Those bright lights are headache-inducing, yeah. Oh! Farpoint came out. So if you have PlayStation Virtual Reality System, then you can get Farpoint, and I play Dr. Eva Tyson on it, and it's actually a really freaking cool game. You shoot things with a gun, and it was a really cool script and stuff. I liked the story a lot. I've never done it. Oh no. And you're doing it as Tary? Is the helmet attuned? It is, isn't it? Too bad. But we can just steal all of his jewels just for the sake of it. So, did we already say that because next week is a battle royale, that means our hundredth episode-- Okay, you already said that? Was I busy rolling dice and talking? Korshad. The Many is who we want to speak to. All right. I'm definitely going to sit on the ones that are just for decor. Cool. Going to rub my butt all over it. Do you have fermented juice? I'd rather not. How did it go? Is she still a raging bitch? Not even for people who could help them with their name? That's a very good point. No, we're not drunk, we may have just had a little bit of wine, just a small amount. That's your plan? Don't sacrifice your entire life for this, though. Do the Truscans, that's who you are being married into potentially, do they have a son? I guess it's not the same, is it? Of course, I know everything about royalty. Sure. Let's talk to the mob! Tary, of course we will! You know what an adjective is! That's impressive. Should we go to the Grumpy Lily, then? This is going so well. Out the house, like get out? Fine. How's your mother? Wow. All right, to the Laughing Ninny it is. Just dive in then? All three, really. Does it look like there's any seams in the ground that would be a trapdoor or anything? 17. Oh, you can keep going. That's true. (laughing) Do you need any help? Nobody's just old. Impressive. I give him two gold. You're welcome. Sir? On your way to the back, could you tell the Many we'd like to speak to them? Oh, just a conversation with the Many. No, yeah, we'll definitely keep those. Running ahead, turning around. I want to pay attention to what key he's taking. Sploosh! Yes. That she is. I'll look for people hiding. 24. Okay. You'll hang behind me, Tary? Pike is with Grog. Yeah. It's like you in Japan, baby! We went into McDonald's and his head hit the ceiling! Well, no, we could stand here for ten minutes! Yeah, start it now! Just do it while we're walking! Thanks. Thanks, Keyleth. That felt good. That was a nice trip down memory lane. Oh, hey! How's it going there? Do you feel inspired? No. We're here to speak to the Many. We're going to just go on in, then. The good stuff is down here. Thank you. Do we see room for a large group? All right. Split up? No, let's not do that. Yeah, obviously. Right. All right. This is about as in as we get with the Many. Yeah. He or she may not reveal themselves too quickly. That is a beautiful idea. Care of one Taryon Darrington. Oh, we'll cover the drink, darling. Party funds cover the drink. It's just in your name. Can we grab a barmaid? Do we recognize any semblance of that garb? Well, my history is shit, but 19. You said it was to the east? It is now. Oh! Oh man, that's right. Now you have to stick to what you wrote. That's crazy. Maybe some of us don't smell very good in this group. I'm not one of them, though. I smell amazing. I guess all of us can sit at the table because of the people-- No, probably. Whiskey? She can drink most people under the table. I nudge him under the table. What does he like? Oh, I was planning on totally watching that, too. Should I roll, too? Well yeah, okay. 30. I'm keeping an eye on the side of the room that he glanced in, looking for anybody going and delivering drinks to the people. Can I read his lips? The Change-Bringer's Nectar? Ooh! I'll take that. On charisma checks? I like it. It can't get any nicer than it already is. Gross! That makes me want an empanada right now. He's in the middle of a conversation right now. Let him take some time. Oh no, Pike! Just tiny sips. Drink some, maybe some water, too, in between each sip. Hey, Tary. Just calm down. This is mainly what I'm trying to tell you right now. Stop being so weird. It might actually help you just a little bit. And don't look sneaky. Yeah, seriously. Just have a little sip. A little sip, it's always good to relax your nerves. Yeah, jauntily. That's good, yeah. Okay, maybe stop. I'm just afraid he's going to look over here at any moment. I'm keeping an eye on good old Korshad, and seeing if he looks over here. I also want to see if I can catch his lips and see what he's talking about over on the side there. Of course he fucking does. I do, too! What are you doing? You don't have to do that. Yeah, that one's good. Just this. That's it, Pike. Pike's got it. He's definitely going to come over and talk to us now, I can feel it. We're so cool. You charmed her! That's what I planned on doing, is waiting out that conversation. I in no way want to interrupt it. I want to get one of those fancy drinks for myself and see what it is. I want one of the Korshad drinks. I'll go up to the bar. We don't know his name, do we? The bartender's name? Of course, darling. I didn't catch your name. Wence, thank you so much. Could I grab another of those fabulous five-gold drinks there, that you brought to our friend? I don't know, what is it? I'm going to give it a go. Slowly but surely marking little amounts off this party fund, y'all. It's like brushing your teeth, only you get drunk. Foul. I'm learning that he probably has minty fresh breath. Yeah, but mine's in an ugly cup. Do you have one? Pull it out. Do you really have a jewel-encrusted-- you do, in your fucking Bag of Holding? Sweet. I'm going to clean that shit out, pour it in. This is gorgeous. Taryon. You drink out of this one. Yeah, you're the one that bought him the drink. Look like you're drinking it, too. How is it? Do you like it? I know. Can I go over and talk to Wence one more time? Actually, no. I give him five gold. No, I'd rather not. No, I was just wondering, do you know how long Korshad usually hangs out here every night? Always with the same company, or different people? Oh, wow. Would you mind going over to him and just letting him know that the gentleman who bought him the drink would love a moment of his time. Taryon Darrington. He needs to know the name. No rush. But make sure it happens. I walk over and put my hand on Taryon's shoulder and keep eye-contact with Korshad. You said that over the earring? Okay. Oh please, join us. Yes. For the sake of this. I'm going to move my hands but just know my hands are here the whole time. Okay? I'm sure you're familiar with Taryon here. And you are familiar with his father as well? We've heard tell of recent situations with his family and you. And we were hoping we could come to an agreement. Well, I don't know if you've heard of Vox Machina? And I'm well aware that someone like you could find a good use for someone like us. Potentially. If it could help clear the Darrington name. 230,000 gold. If we're hearing correctly. So would the Darringtons simply work for you? And past that point, they would be in no debt to you? If we take care of this for you, it does seem like a monumental task. From what we've learned, ancient beings tend to be quite powerful. We would ask that you don't slander the Darrington name. That when they stay in their estate, everyone believes they are still the Darringtons as they have always been. There's always a choice, dear. Do we need to decide at this moment? The diviner would be wonderful to speak to. Good. Yeah. You're going to go by yourself. I think you're good. Always have your back, dear. Three! Let's go! On the way out, can I grab Wence again, one last time? Most of the people here, are they local patrons or do they come from all over? Great. Thank you. It's all I needed. Nice. Yeah, we need to camp because we need to rest and get our shit back. Herethis. I mean, do we know anything? Have we ever heard about the woods of Herethis or the Platinum Mines of Herethis? Oh man. No, but really, that's where the battles took place, huh? So this ancient being could be from, potentially-- Yeah! If we die, we die. Don't say it, Keyleth. Do not fucking say it. Don't say it about all of us and doom us to your fate. Oh shit. I would like to point out that this same person you are so adamantly protecting from our scrying or our spying or our finding is the same person who shit in the middle of a temple so that he could watch Pike. I just realized I have the other half of the stone. The traveling stone. I could pop in on him anytime I want. That would be really, really shit if he did that. Exalted? No, but seriously. What are we doing? I don't think we use that mercenary to walk into a mine. I'm not sending her to her death. No. We go ask her how to hire her. Oh. Well, he writes me all the time, but outside of that. (laughs) I have so many secrets to keep, dear. So many. It really does. We go find-- (laughs) Definitely. Never to be heard from again because we'll forget that we have that connection. (laughter) Misty Step tonight and then that way we can recover everything? Let's Misty Step there-- Oh, sorry. Yeah, I don't want to camp right next to the-- Did you get it? I think a Cure Wounds, a light Cure Wounds would probably help. We'll land a little bit away. Let's land a little bit away. Were the bodies on top or were the bodies down below? Pike can do that. I'll go with Pike and we can stealth in. She can't talk to them as mist. Oh, okay. I'll cast Pass Without a Trace, anyways, so we'll be stealthy going in. So I do that. And me. Okay, you're still out there? Oh, gods. I'm going to get my broom ready. And while Pike is doing her ritual I'm just going to keep a hand on her, that if anything happens then I can just take off with her in tow. Like downward dog? Oh. What's that called? It's okay. Good start. Skittering beasts? (whispering) What did the skitterers look like? Oh, in my drink? Yeah, but that's really big. The skittering creatures? That's already three questions. I didn't hear, something about his spit. What did he say? What's the smaller one?! Yeah, I don't think that's what it is. Yeah, did the pincers sound like something we have fought though, before? Nature check? Do I get advantage because I'm standing in the woods? Six! Oh. I wonder if we could sprinkle it around us and they won't bother us because we'll smell like their brethren. Hey, man, it's an idea. Yes, we definitely should have a Heroes' Feast. Maybe you can ask where the thing is in the mine. It's just straight down at the bottom of it? Yeah, then you might survive that one? Only if you turn into a goldfish and fall onto the ground. It's fine. What are ankhegs? Are they fiends? Aberrations? We're about to fight some big, armored vaginas. Did we understand correctly that it's the baby that cried out is the big monster? The big boss? Okay. And that's the thing that woke up the skitterers? Okay. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't like, there's a big boss and then there's skitterers and then there's also little babies that cry out. No, we don't know what woke up the baby. Maybe we should talk to another dead person. They're not miners. Natural 20. No, I haven't rolled. I'm trying to make myself roll it. (gasps) Oh my god I rolled a natural 20! It's like Run Lola, Run where she's doing the roulette thing and she's like-- How? Yeah. We're camping. But we should camp in the trees, y'all. Not in the ground, in case the things come up out. Oh man. 15? Oh wait! I honestly don't know anymore what my favored terrain does for me. I always feel like I'm bullshitting it now. What am I rolling? Investigation? 24. Hey, this is a place! Let's do it here! All right. Yay, Heroes' Feast. Advantage on wisdom. We're losing our 17? If you give us a speech, how long does that last? Oh wait, but does that mean we lose our temporary hit points on the Heroes' Feast? Tight. He's giving you a look. You're going to get better at it, Keyleth. Just add that to the 19 then? But the 19 we can heal to? Kerr bear. Oh no, it wasn't Kerr bear. It was Tova. Don't you already have that with your-- Oh yeah, that one. That's right. Oh, hey. Well, no. Maybe would this be a bad idea? To shoot an Oracle Arrow down into the bottom? Well. We have this method that we used to do. Light the arrow on fire, and then send it down. So I can see by the light of the fire on it. I don't think so. That's true, he does. He does heal people a lot. Wait, should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us? No, I'm going to do the Oracle Arrow first. Oh. What if we wake it up when I shoot it down and things come out? I like this idea. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, just to be safe. So we can stealth and be quiet. Yeah, but they'll just keep falling, won't they? How does that work? It will make the most glorious bacon! All right. I'm setting my arrow on fire, and I'm shooting it down into the pit. That was helpful. Super helpful. That's true. I didn't see the great baby beast down at the bottom. Potentially. In that small circle. Okay, so we could take the flying carpet down. A couple of people could fly. We can take the flying carpet down. You think? The skitterers are going to come out of the walls? It may be good to blind them if they dwell under the surface. We have a flying carpet, two brooms, a set of wings. Up and out. Yes, you can. The only people we need to get on it are Percy and Pike. Everybody else can fly. Unless Keyleth is out of-- Hop on the broom. Yeah. All right. Because you got that down in the fucking Nine Hells, right? That is so crazy. This is just the stupidest. We're sticking to the middle. Oh shit! Flying carpet! Ooh, shit, and add ten, y'all. 39. Don't land. And we're whispering. We're whispering, but we're not whispering so that people can hear. We're definitely whispering over-- Can I look, too? 22. Is it emitting light? Is it like an orc? Should we just nuke it? Should we just nuke that thing? Oh, it was like a coffin. Does it look like a coffin? A teeny bit. Abyssal? Draconic? Yeah, they're human. They can't see shit. Should we cast some light down here? And we back away from the thing. Advantage on! Oh shit. Wow, it's cool-looking! Oh shit, we're right by the baby. Oh, that's the baby? Oh, it's a mean baby. I feel like it could be saved, because it's-- I feel bad because it's a baby. 12. I'm so far below you in the initiative, though. Whoa. Good job! Kill that celestial baby! Get all the bacon! Oh no! We're in its lair! Thanks for coming right next to me on that one. Goddamn it. What am I doing, a constitution? Nine. A giant baby rattle that's directly in front of it. Oh yeah! I'm resistant to cold, Travis just reminded me! I have cold resistance because of my Vorugal armor. Does that mean I roll again for-- Oh, okay. So that was 17? Okay, so add nine back. Did Beacon of Hope get everybody? Death saving throw is huge. And healing is huge. You're next to the big white thing. You got this. You got this, Pike. What is it? You have to get above half of the damage you took, is that what it is? Oh. Good roll! What is this considered, Underdark, or a dungeon? Get it! He needs a nap. Yeah, I'm frozen. Yay. You could enlarge, maybe. You can enlarge and come up out of it. Is it wearing a diaper, or is its dangly bits hanging out? Oh no. Just picked her up and dropped her there. You rolled a lot of sixes! They're all sixes. That's how she fell off the wall. Oh, look how teeny! I can finally see it. It's so teeny. I guess I'll fly up so I can see over the wall. I have no idea what's going on. Wow. Can I Hunter's Mark the baby? And then I'm going to try to shoot the baby with my Blazing Bowstring. That would be a 30. And I'm going to make it a bramble shot. DC of 17. Yeah. Motherfucker. Okay, well. Still 4d8 extra. Well. 17, plus five is 22, plus eight is 30, plus two is 32, plus 1d6 lightning damage... 35, plus 1d6 for Hunter's Mark is 40. Oh wait! Plus the blazing bowstring, another two fire damage. I want to try to do the same thing again. With a Blazing Bowstring again. 28. Okay, bramble shot again, because I get two, motherfucker! That's ten for my Blazing Bowstring. Oh, Jesus H. Macy. 19, plus five is 24, plus eight is 32, 36. Oh my god, 34. 38, plus ten is 48. Be free, little angel baby. We shall feast tonight! That's so gross. And I just shoot the baby. I mean, it was an evil baby, right? Should we get out of here? While she's doing that, can I just look over the ground and see if there's any platinum deposits? Oh god. Get to the middle and get in the air. No, the carpet. We just got to get the carpet. I can go down and grab the carpet. We don't have a few minutes. You don't have to do that. I can go get the carpet. I'm right there. Are we bamfing out or are we flying up? Or we can Plane Shift. But still really cool! I hope that it slowly becomes a forest underground. Can you Daylight or something, like up and out? Dexterity saving throw? That is so much better. Should you reroll? 27. Yeah, I'll do the same thing. 23. How much further do we have to go up?! You should heal yourself! 60 feet in diameter. No! You can make a straight wall of 100 feet or 60 feet in diameter. The little coffin. Okay. Oh my god! The baby was created by the chat?! That was a really cool villain. Yeah, was it evil? Or could we have saved it? Yeah. Go for Keyleth to begin with. Try to kill her. No, you're my best friend. I won't kill you. Tight.
