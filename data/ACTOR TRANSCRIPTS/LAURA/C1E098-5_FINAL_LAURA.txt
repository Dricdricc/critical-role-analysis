Did it make it? We'll find out. By the way, I saw voting-- there was a poll to see who they thought would win. Okay. I had to test it! That was the Joe-dice. He's making it into the battle. That's right. Wait, wait, wait! Were we supposed to make alliances?! Yes. What is it?! Do we get to know what it is? You already have fate dice! You have a fucking Deck of Many Things. You have an entire plethora of fate dice. Enjoy the fate die, Keyleth or Grog. This is serious! This is serious! Oh my God! I was just looking at the top-view, I didn't realize that those are fucking towers! (panting) Okay! Six! Oh God. Oh, with Trinket up there! Look at us, spreading out our numbers! So wait, we can cast things in these six seconds? Oh my gosh! 19. Wait a minute, here's my question. Did we see where everybody landed? Could we see everybody, when we came down? Or did we just see the guy? When he said you have six seconds, I immediately duck down and cast Pass Without a Trace on myself and Trinket. It's like a trapped thing? This is so Hunger Games. Oh shit! Okay. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on me and Trinket. And I'm going to send him down-- Is there a trapdoor or like a stairway around? That he can go down? He's going to make his way down. But I am going to hide, at the top here, behind one of those-- So my stealth is 30. Solid. Oh shit, you're already there! And you die. That's pretty smart. Just putting yourself in the ball? That's smart, you know what? And then we can't hurt you. Oh shit! Unless somebody can dispel it or something? So wait. Only air can pass through it, huh?LAURA,  Oh my God!, MARISHA, MARISHA I'm so nervous. Oh! Oh! Are there lair actions? Okay, I can see Grog as well, because I'm assuming his head is above those parapets? I have Sharpshooter, so he does not. I'm going to send Trinket down. Trinket's like (confused bear sound). I can't see him! He's hidden, like from my field of view, I'm assuming I can't really see him. Can I see Percy? I'm going to still shoot Grog. Yeah, I'm going to shoot Grog twice. Once with the Blazing Bowstring, and we're just going to see how that goes. Aww man! 17. So it hits! Yes! Oh, shit. 15. 15 plus four lightning damage. Wait, lightning damage is halved? Okay, and then four lightning damage. And then five points of fire damage. Damn it, he gets half piercing damage? Fuck! Okay, I'm going to try it again. And that's an 18! 14 halved is seven. No, wait. Eight, because it's 16 points of damage. Plus four lightning damage. Plus Blazing Bowstring. Seven points of fire damage. And I'm going to use my bonus action. I'm going to move down a couple parapets towards you and I'm going to keep hiding as my bonus action. Do I have to roll if I've got skirmisher stealth? Or do I just continue to hide? I'm just wondering how that works. I know. I don't remember. Yeah, it's a ranger thing. Oh, so I could say, I'm keeping hidden from Percy. And then I would roll for stealth to hide from everybody else? I'm going to keep hidden from Percy for skirmisher stealth, and then I'm going to roll for stealth, and I got a 24 to hide from everybody else. Yeah. Is this tee-time? That's what Earthbreaker Groon had! I like the idea of seeing Tary like... Oh, fuck, is there loot? And I'm up top?! Fuck. I do have a beacon. I have a feeling that beacon is going to attack us. Ooh, with the roof on there and everything. Are you celebrating that I'm getting hurt? You dick. 24. All right. Yeah? Okay. Okay. Who can I see? Okay. Trinket's going to run up to Tary and push him back in the water. (laughing) Just gentle enough to put him right in the middle. 16. Well, then, I'll tell you what. Was that an attack for Trinket? Okay, then I'm going to save my action until somebody outside of Tary or Doty becomes visible. The minute I see his head! 17. 11 halved. Plus three lightning damage. Oh, because you're enlarged. All right. Ooh, that next one is good. That definitely hits. And then 16, 17, 19 halved. Because he's not by anybody, is he? Okay. Down and dirty. Can totally see your head outside of the-- Yeah, I can. From where I am, I can see your head. Aww. You terrible person. Aww, buddy. Wait, how many damage was that? 34? I'm going to say 34. Oh, Doty! Or is it just what we had on our body? Yeah, we aren't, but yeah that's true, Grog always has a bunch. Don't, none of us do anything. If we don't do anything for a minute, Tary's weak. It's a mimic! Okay, Grog's coming for me. First of all, Trinket's going to just wade out into that water to get no longer on fire. Damn it, it's acid or something. What is it? No, Trinket goes ow, ow, and then he comes back out. Trinket, I didn't even tell you to do that, you just did that on your own! And then-- Yeah, you know. And then I'm going to get on my broom-- What's a whale? I get on my broom and I want to fly up and over, above Grog. Actually, could I actually get to Grog if I was flying? I couldn't get down to him, though? Oh, this is going to be the worst move ever if it doesn't work. I'm going to get down to where Grog is. This is so stupid, though! No, because if it doesn't work I can't get away! Because that's all my movement, isn't it? You want to team up? I go down to Grog and I say, let's shake on it. But I take my necklace off and I put it into my hand. TALIESIN and Oh, it's a one. Whatever. I still try to touch it to him. Whatever, he doesn't do it. It's a wisdom saving throw. It's only a ten. You can't unless I release you. Hey, man. My mind's already there. Yes, I plan on it, believe me. I'm going to use my bonus action to stay hidden from... for my skirmisher stealth, can I pick a target? I want to stay hidden from Keyleth. Great. So I can't use my bonus action to hide, because she's right there. Tight. I'm going to then use my skirmisher to stay hidden from Percy, and I've got nothing I can do. He could bust out of the necklace. Does that mean if I put an actual monster inside of it during the game that they could break out? And he's designed to not think. I'm so dead, you guys. He's going to pop out! Oh no, that could be really bad. Oh shit! What if you get sucked into a random void? Then we can never defeat you. Oh god, he's out! I was going to release you! Not with sharpshooter, I think. If they're prone, we don't take disadvantage, right? No. I glare at Percy, from under Grog's armpit. I'm going to put myself out. I'm going to disengage. Yes. And I'm going to kick off the ground and fly up as high as I can. I want to be over the roof of the building below me. You are so cruel. 16! I have a feeling this going to kill him. Oh, and I don't have the necklace anymore! Or unconscious. 21 points is what he had. Trinket is unconscious. Is there room for that? How big is that damn orb? You can fit it up inside there. I really hope the fire pillar goes off. Yeah, but you've got a hole in it. Wait, you have four attacks? Oh! Welp. I can see Percy, so I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. And then I'm going to attack him. This first attack. Well, let's see. Oh yeah, that hits. Yeah, that definitely hits, 31. And it's a bramble shot. So you have to roll a strength DC. For the regular? Oh right. Okay, wait. That's an additional 4d8. (adding) 38, plus six lightning damage. You're so strong, darling. I'm so impressed. Right as I throw another arrow at him. (laughter) I'm going to do another... no, I'm not. I'm not going to do a bramble shot on him. I'm just going to do a regular shot. Well, yeah, he's taking half damage. Oh wait, do you only get to use the catch once? 12, 14, 16 plus six lightning damage. Fuck, okay. Those are my two attacks, so can I fly down to the ground behind the building... actually, they're all over on the other side. I'm going to drop down where I am. Yeah, to the roof. And I'm going to lay down on the roof and use my bonus action to hide. 27. This is the sixth round. This is the fifth round. After this will be the sixth. It's smart. (laughter) I'm going to take off from the roof and try to make it to the opposite tower. Yeah. Can I see anything? 20. Well, then I'll try to hit her. I'm going to attack her! That's a 27. MATT and Eight plus five is-- no, is it? No. 13? 15, plus four lightning damage. And then I'm going to do it again. I'm going to do a bramble shot on her, because I only did the one. 25 to hit. (counting) 32, plus three lightning damage. Yeah, I figured. I bet Tary's up here, but I don't know that. I'm going to use my bonus action to hide. I was hidden at the beginning of the turn, but I'm assuming my movement took me out of hiding. Can I use my skirmisher's stealth to choose a quarry to stay hidden? Or I have to be hidden at the top of the turn? Okay, I'm going to hide. Only 18. Oh, I forgot he's just unconscious. He's not dead yet. I haven't been making saving throws for him. We have earrings, dear. (laughter) Do I hear Tary go (yelps) anywhere? Oh my god. 20. How many? 10d10? MATT and All right. He knows where, but nobody else does. Motherfuck. Oh, that's great; that definitely saves. 30. Okay. (groans) But I can't see her? I can't see anybody from where I am? There's nowhere for us to hide! No, I know. It's ground hiding. I'm going to fly up towards you, Matthew. Yes. And I'm going to hover right there. Wait, can I see Keyleth? Okay, but three-quarters, and I can still attack her? Okay. I'm going to attack her. She's in that building. I want to be low enough that at the end of my movement I can drop down to the ground. I mean, drop down to the roof. Yeah. (laughing) Yeah. That works, too! She's still Hunter's Marked from before, isn't she? I Hunter's Marked Percy. Then I'm going to move my Hunter's Mark to Keyleth. Oh, wait. That's a bonus action, just to move it? Okay, then never mind. I'm not going to do that. It probably is; I'm not going to do it. 26 to hit. Okay. No. 16, plus five lightning damage. And I'm going to hit her again. And the second attack is 30. 16 plus four lightning damage. And then for my bonus action, I'm going to cast-- oh, wait, can I do that? No, it's not. Shitballs. I was thinking I had a potion, but I don't, and I can't cast a Cure Wounds. That's an action. And I can't retrograde a Hex on her. So I'm going to try to hide again, because that's the only bonus I can do right now. I'm going to drop down to the ground. I don't have any movement. I used all my movement just to get there. Tight. Because there's no such thing as Fire Storm, which just fucking destroyed me. No such thing. Maybe I'll roll a natural 20 and then she'll just not know that I dropped down. I rolled a natural 20! Does it matter at all that I rolled a natural 20? I have to pee so bad. No, what if I die? 25. Well, that's good. What did you just do? Okay. Sphill. The Flaming Sphill is what she said, and that is what it forever will be called. Oh, I only called a giant Fire Storm! If I flew up to the top of the tower, nobody would see me that I know, right? Right now? Okay. Then I'm going to fly up to the top of the tower by me. But I'm going to be at the back. I'm going to step away from the edge so that people on the ground can't see me. Yeah. Okay, and I'm going to use my action to cast Cure Wounds at 3rd level. Which is 3d8. 15, plus my spellcasting modifier, which is 18 points. So I heal 18 points of health. And then I'm going to use my bonus action. Oh, okay. I can't go down there. Before I moved, can I have cast Hunter's Mark on Keyleth, for my bonus? I still don't have visual? Do I have visual on her now? Can I say I moved up, cast Hunter's Mark on her, and then backed off? Okay, and that's it. The chest wasn't on fire and the potion wasn't destroyed? (laughing) You're still burning. No. I love it. He is loving that fire. Seriously! Just a bystander, this whole fight. But all the acid pours up and out, doesn't it? Displacement. Does Trinket get hit by the acid? But Doty does, too. Right. But just in case. Keyleth doesn't care about animals, apparently. Only plants. I heard Grog yell "empty." I know where Grog is. I'm going to step over and attack him. Oh yeah. 30? Okay. Yeah. 12 plus two lightning damage. And then the second one definitely hits. 16 plus one lightning damage. And for my bonus action, I'm going to-- oh god. No. No, he can get up to me. I'm going to get on my broom and I'm going to fly up! I'm going to fly into the air for my movement. I don't want to fly up. I want to fly over. I want to fly away from Grog. No, towards the other brazier. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to do that. Oh god! You know what? Ooh, this could be real bad. Nope. I'm not. I'm thinking about it. I'm going to fly. I'm going to be up, but I'm going to stay over the roof. This is still stupid. I'm going to die. Grog's going to kill me. But further over towards-- I want to hover over the roof, but towards the other brazier. Sorry. I got confused, Matt. I thought that's where you were saying I was. Okay. Hi, Grog. (laughter) Oh, it hits me. Doesn't. Oh. Shit. (laughter) Oh, 34 to hit. Oh god. Oh dear lord. Oh no! I think my math is wrong. Hold on. Hold on, that doesn't make sense. 25, you say? Oh no, I just dropped unconscious. (laughter) Yeah, I'm sure. Kill me quickly so I can go pee, because I've had to for an hour now. Come on. Oh, are you immune to acid damage? What is he at, then? Oh, okay. She basically pooped. That's what it sounded like she did. I know, right? I mean, come on, that would've been the absolute best thing to do. Damn, I wish my thing wasn't busted. I would put him in the-- Save. He has the actual, Matt! Oh, we have t-shirts... We have Gilmore's Glorious Goods, we have Vox Machina t-shirts, we have How Do You Want to Do This? t-shirts... You never know. No. It's in a couple weeks, right? Is that enough time to plan anything? Two weeks from now? We could throw something together, right? Oh my god, it's going to be a grim reaper that comes out and kills Grog immediately. Can I? Okay! Okay! What is Ruin? It looks terrible. What does that one do? Oh, it looks good. It looks like a good one. Intelligence! Is this a good one, too? It looks good. I hope I've cursed him! Please let me have cursed him! Five is a lot. Five is as high as you can count. Oh no, this looks good, too. Does he get a wish? Please be on top of the tower on a horse. Can you move? Can you move? Is that a 20? What do you want? He's not dead? That's a failed death save for me. That's two fails. Well, all right. One! No fate dice for us, Percy. Have you been adding your wisdom modifier this whole time? Plus one. Run away! Plane Shift was her 7th-level spell? Tary will be the survivor because he's hiding. Why couldn't he have rolled like he did on the one-shot, where it was one after one after one? He got another 20! What did you get? No, he's just resistant. So poison, acid he's not resistant to. Oh, he's not resistant to acid. Had to bring him back, didn't you? I like that we thought this might go fast. He's got a lot. He had a lot of hit points. Tary. Not impossible, Tary. It's not impossible. Wait, you can't cast 3rd-level spells after you've already done a spell. You can only do 2nd-level. If he knocks you off your broom? Did he get knocked off his broom? He doesn't have the same things that I have. Oh shit! Don't. Kill him, Tary! He has to roll a natural 20 in order to get this. No. He has to roll a 19. Oh, a saving throw? Oh shit. It's not even that much. It's a 13 or higher. Oh my god. And your parents are named after Tony Stark's parents. How crazy is that? Oh man. That was awesome. You did have places that people that were flying could hide. I had no idea you could break out of my fucking necklace! Well, you don't know that because it was all a dream in Tary's fucking head. You did go down hard. All of your war paint is gone. No, he's just been wiping his face the whole night. It's all over his hands, probably. No, don't. I mean, how?
