Yeah. Say Trinket, say Trinket I'm leaving probably during the game, to catch my flight to go to GenCon for the Titansgrave panel. Tomorrow! Well, after I saw my glorious Trinket yesterday, there was no choice really. I don't understand anything you just said. Phillip doesn't exist anymore. Phillip's legacy is 1,000 gold to repay. In the tavern room? What difference does it make? I want to take a shot with my brother. Does it taste like NyQuil? Right. Tastes like your feet smell, brother. See you on the other side Oh, yeah. I bet Tiberius has metal canisters, he's got so many canisters. I've got food. 25?! Oh, that's lovely. What's your name, woman? Lovely. Did you want to know my name? Vex'ahlia. It's a pleasure Yes. I love being out here without my brother. I just love it. I do. (whispers) She's got blood. You made it yourself? Damn, that's impressive. Leading? Oh, you are too. She is... yeah. What sort of fighter are you, Lyra? Not at all. Very in-charge. What do you normally do? Bookkeeping? Storage? Grog look, papaya. And Trinket, Trinket too. This is my bear. Yes, of course we get Trinket! Scanlan Do we get Trinket on the trip? This is Trinket. A brown one. Oh, that would be lovely actually. Actually I think Percy is quite hungry. Perhaps you've heard of us? Castle Greyskull Keep. We have?! Where did we meet Aldor? (gasps) That guy! I mean, he looked kind of like a dick. If you want my personal opinion but-- I would like to thank you very much, as well. For putting us in her capable hands. What do you eat? Do you eat-- does it get stuck in your teeth a lot? Superior? Perhaps. That doesn't seem really-- I've got plenty. Take it. If you need it. I'll hold onto it. I shall take it. I will-- Ha! Sorry Lyra. Of course. It's like a whip. (gasps) But I won. I won. Give it to me. What? Please. I already have it. I already have it on my shoulder. It's too late. I'm writing it down. A white dragon? Would I know? I would know, because I've studied them. Didn't we kill a white dragon? TRAVIS and No, I thought the ice dragon thing-- wasn't she white? Yeah, the woman and then she turned into a dragon. So anything else we get to keep ourselves? And scales, definitely. There will be plenty of scales. What about Trinket? Does he use his paw? Trinket. Shake. Just the biggest one. You killed someone who was sleeping with your boyfriend? Okay. It's a person that changes into animals, am I right? Oh you killed a wolf? No, yeah, that's great. Oh, they're really scary. I mean, he looked actually kind of frightened. And whimpering, really. No, yes, he seems like he would have been had he hadn't-- Especially when he got burned by Tiberius. His face is fine. Three days? That's what I'm doing. I'm checking that out. Oh, that works too. Oh, that's great. Well then we can use it in conjunction. Because I can use Primeval Awareness and find any dragons within six miles. It's like fishing line coming out of his face. Percy's seen some shit. So, can I do that then? I can't find his exact location, but I can... So can I--? Shit. Zahra, what about you, do you know about dragons? All right, let's do that. Roll a d20, and add your religion. Great first roll. 20. Sees them? You're not with us. Oh, thank you. Dagon, is that your name? I've heard many things about your knowledge of dragons. Yes. I have seen dragons, and they suck. Unless you like them. Do you like them? The Glasswalk...? The Glasswalk... Road? Yes, of course. And then there was a dragon? I believe that you saw a dragon and I believe that it was white because you were in a blizzard. Right? Am I right? Very much like a worg, if you will. Well. Actually. Dragon. That's a giant dagger, if I've ever seen one. I would never have guessed that's where that was going. White dragon? Whoa. That's great. How did you make it back, without dying? Did the dragon keep flying in the direction of the Glasswalk Road? Or did it go east or west? Or which way? We believe you. Actually, could I roll for perception or insight to see if he's telling the truth on everything? Oh yeah, two. No, 17. No, is that a 17 or an 11? 17. Can I perception and see how heavy that bag of gold actually looks? I just want to know. Okay, I'm going to roll the gold dice. 24. I love this plan. Go to the blizzard. Does the guild give you money for..? Lovely. As we're leaving, I walk up behind Lyra and I put my hand on her shoulder, and then I reach down and grab her bag of gold and I (clears throat) and look down to it and say, you might want to keep a better eye on this, darling. There are very very nasty people around. I didn't take anything, I'm simply letting you know. Thank you so much, darling. You have lovely eyes. Maybe when we shop you can tell me all about Aldor. Blizzards. It ices things. We'll definitely need some sort of protection against ice attacks. Yeah. How are we going to do that exactly? Thereabouts, yes. We definitely need warm things. Actually, I have warm cloaks for the party and half of our party isn't here so we can have them. Seriously? Wait, so does he give discounts to family members? Lyra, I think we're going to be best friends! So can we find horses in the area? How about we rent them, and if they don't make their way back we'll pay you the difference? Oh, try it. Do it! DC 17. Right. I mean, Uncle Randy after all. That's lovely. Wait, well-- You can ride with me, Scanlan. But, Trinket-- Does he ride-- is he as fast as a horse? Well, how-- No! Why do you always wanna leave my wonderful bear?! I know, he almost dies every time I put him in battle. It's ridiculous. He is adorable, isn't he? Oh! Okay. Okay. Well, it's doable. Wait, who's-- who's paying? But it-- half our party isn't here, so-- I am very, very nervous that somebody is going to die when we fight this dragon. Ooh! So, protection against ice magic. Does anybody have stuff that works for that? Lyra do you know any-- Should we call you uncle? Oh! Um, I thought-- Uncle Randy? Definitely. We're great. Trinket's wonderful. No. Yeah. Since we're on a time crunch, Scanlan. I'd say yes. Probably need to make camp. There's also lots of wood around, Grog. Keyleth would be proud. I miss my brother. Good job, Grog. Ah, that's really good. I need something like that. Do we have any magic stuff that makes us resistant? I have one, too. Yeah, but we don't have any ice-resistant things, outside of that damn-- Are we starting a fire? Yeah, of course we do. Grog, one second. Here-- Thank you, Grog. You did. You really did. Can I watch with Zahra? Yes. No. It was us. Oh, no. It's quite comfortable against my side, actually. It's not heavy at all. We don't have anything in it, darling. Where do you come from? We just don't see very many tieflings around here. Feren. And you left because...? That sounds familiar. Yes, actually. My mother was killed. Yes. A dragon. (sighs) I wonder if it was white. My father's alive. An asshole, actually. Really? Oh, wow. Mine's just a jerk. Zahra. Getting a bit personal here around the fire. (laughs) Here. Have some food. Disgusting. Grog found it. I don't know. Oh. Ugh. Grog. What? (groans) Cream cancer. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh God. How did I just immediately forget that's what we were doing? Oh! I have to put my glasses on today. My magic glasses of seeing. Eight. Yep. Oh God. Why did we all roll terribly. I should have grabbed some of that dessert that's here. Trinket! Wake up! Oh God! Are they attacking Percy? Oh no. We're all going to die. Instakill! This is the best night for Percy, ever. Yes, definitely. That's insane. Can we all get inspiration from seeing Percy just massacre? Gross! Hell yeah.That's so mean. Oh no! Okay. I'm going to cast-- How many people are on Percy? I'm going to do Hunter's Mark on the damaged one. Should I get-- Yeah, the one that's damaged. Yeah! And I'm going to shoot him. Through my-- I'm going to shoot him through my Flaming Bow. And I also am going to have Trinket attack him twice. How about that? All right. 19 attack. Yes. Plus the d10 for the flaming. 17 to hit, and then Trinket's attacks? Trinket! I never know what to look at because I never attack with Trinket. Okay. That's 22 for one. The second one is a 16. Oh my goodness! I know! You guys! Does that mean he can bite twice? Okay, he's going to do that. Oh wait, no. One is going to be bite and one is going to be claws. Oh, I didn't do Hunter's Mark on the previous one. Four for Hunter's Mark. 13. No 12, for one attack. And then-- What did I just do? I did it wrong. That was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is 11 for the first one. And then the second one. This is so new and exciting. And 12 for the second. Yes! Have a meal, buddy! Hell yeah I do! That's me. Cantrip? So 24. That's damage. That's not a d10, that's a d12. Oh, you know what, I was rolling eights instead of tens. That's okay. Ten. Fuck. It's like a Hunter's Mark all on your own. How is she so cool? (laughs) That poor orc! Did you get another 20? We have to fight dragons soon. A dragon. What did he say? What did he say? Tell him we're just passing through. Heck yeah! What, is he going to fight with us? Can I try as well? 16, is what I rolled. Well, let's find out about our dragon first. Will he? How do you know? Why don't we just ask him? There's a dragon. Where is it? Do you know of a secret passageway to get up to it? Yeah, well we're pretty stupid. Do you know of a path? He is giving me sass! I can actually! I can most definitely detect the dragon. So, you're saying that we need to not be out in the open, because the dragon is attracted to things that are not hidden? You want to come with us? Then stop giving us sass! Did you see how fast we killed your friends? We're pretty amazing. Yes. Most definitely. We are. But here's the thing-- Well, he probably would've led his friends to us to kill us. (sings) Scanlan make you feel good. I'm gonna try to see if there's a dragon within-- What's that? Sorry? Can I Primeval Awareness the dragon? The dragon, then. Still? It's still-- oh right, it's towards a mountain. Is it okay to keep sleeping right here, are they going to come search for us? Probably not more than one search party. Oh. Our horses are okay? Oh, that's good. Oh, that works too. Can you-- Oh yes, Dust of Tracelessness. He's got this stuff, we can cover our tracks. Yeah. Never. Oh, poor thing. Yeah. Why did we-- The other team has the carpet? Those bastards. Why? Because Tiberius can fly, why the hell did we give them the carpet? (laughter) All right. Are we still in the forest? Okay. Natural 20! Sorry, that was my first one. It's bad thing to roll a natural 20 on. It's Trinket, you know. (gasps) Sure, I will try it again. There. There's a dragon. It's fast, wait. It's up in the air. We should hide just in case. How about we hide? No way. 24. All of us are like, ahh. Can I see which direction it's going back towards the mountain? Great. We got to go in the forest. Well, I can also, you know, see what kind of creatures are around. No, I can't. I can't see animals. Just kidding. All right. Oh, you can't fly all of us, can you? You can fly up to nine people? Tiberius can only fly up to three people. If we're flying, though, I'm just going to put this out there. There's nowhere to hide if the dragon comes back out. Well, that's awesome. But is it at the same time or is it a concentration? I have-- Yes, movement is fine for all of the group. I would also like to perception ahead and make sure that nothing is going to sneak attack us again. That is lower than my passive perception, though. Which is 21. -- is 21. And plus five-- no, that's it, just 21. But it's a 12. For right now. Oh, but I get to roll twice though, because it's my favored terrain? Okay. Shut up. It's-- no, that's not that bad-- It's 15. It's a slight improvement. That's right. We're calling a car, and it's however soon it gets here. Don't walk on this lake. 16. We should avoid it. Do we see any-- anything along the bottom, the edge of the mountain that looks like it could open into a cavern of some sort? Yeah, delegate. Can we check? Oh, that's smart, Grog. That's really smart! We'll get into cover maybe just to be safe. Ah! What? You're kidding me, right? That sucked. You're kidding me! It's a giant? Oh, no. You speak Giant, you speak Giant, right? Oh no, no no! Shit. I'm damaged. I did. I'm dead! I feel like we did such a good job on the last one. Oh my gosh. You have to be careful with my dice. I've got gems in here. Oh my gosh. You did! And you-- And you made a guy like give us things for super cheap, which is like the best thing in the world. I do too! Yay! That's just not appropriate. I really have to go! I love you! Yeah! Well-- I do-- to what? Just for the heck of it? But I'll be on a panel! The entire time, it's a really long panel. All right, bye!
