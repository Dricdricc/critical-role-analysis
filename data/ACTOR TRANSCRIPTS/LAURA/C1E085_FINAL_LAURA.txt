It hurts, it hurts. Woah. Really? Why aren't I there? Oh man. I know it! Leet! Yeah, it does. Woah. Just woah. (laughs) Oh, no. Be there or be squared! Ooh. Can I vote for Brian? He's blowing up! He's in everything now! It's called Sigil Boost. Do I? Do I? Do- We watched Galaxy Quest last night. So good. Again. For, like, the hundredth time. You know, I mean, there's merch in the store right now. These dice bags that I'm holding in my hand. I literally just happened to be holding it as you asked me that, which is crazy. There's a very small amount of them left, I happen to know. In the barely hundreds. Which, you know, could be a lot or couldn't. Depending on if you want them. There's also shirts! And hats! And patches and-- -- other stuff coming up that I'm real excited about, and I'll show it to you when it's here. Yeah. No! It's just so good. Oh God. (laughs) Oh god, oh god, oh god. Oh, god. Yeah, we said we came in the temple with them. Oh my god! God, oh god. (laughs) You're in jail. (whispers) Oh my god. I wish we had popcorn! (laugh) Ahh! I know, right? "Are you hungry? I'm kind of hungry." Oh shit. Minus two. Oh man. What does he want-a! (whispering) He wants popcorn. Shut up, Brian Wayne Foster! You got this. Natural 20. Two zero, exactly. You can do it, Grog! I don't know what he wants, but figure it out! Great job, Grog! Oh no. Jeez Louise. With gentleness comes clarity. You touched him, maybe if you'd've shaken his hand. Like that little hobbit. What's the lesson? What's the lesson?! Yeah. Oh my god, that would have been amazing. (laughs) Area of effect? Yeah, I think it was, you have to shake his hand or do something, like, gentle to him. I like to think that Earthbreaker Groon has, like, mood music for his fights. He's got a sound system. Ooh! That'd be sick. Instant knockout. The button. It's the button. Maybe he just likes getting hit. He's got like 5,000 hit points. More than last time. (gasps) Four. To the chode hit?! Nice. Really? What does being stunned do? You can't move? I'm gonna pull an arrow out and just stand there and get ready in case Groon does anything. He's waiting for you to become unstunned. Oh shit. Oh no! Gross! No one will ever notice, the armor already stinks. How much damage? (gasps) Does Grog look all bloody yet, or is he-- Can you talk to him? (louder) Can you talk to him? Never mind! You're doing great, Grog! Keep going. (whispers) He looks like shit. Oh, that's fun. 18 and 10? Because of your-- 30? You said 20. It's 30. Yeah. And your brain is already so little. No! No! Minus two? Yeah! He's jumping and crossing his arms-- (gasps) Draw it! Draw it! Quick, Percy! Should I flash him? Should I flash him? You have to be crouched down in order to be grappling him? Shit. Oh my god. Fuck! Oh, did you just poop your pants? What does he want from you? Tell him what you learned! (all laugh) Totally. (gasps) Are you supposed to roll 10's or 12's? Okay. (quietly) That's good, that's good. (groan) No! Go Phillip! Superman punch! No! (all laugh) Ooh, shit. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. (cackles) 22. Get him, Grog! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Oh! We're just screaming our asses off. What? (laughs) Everybody's peeing. (whispers) Oh my gosh. Pike stands next to him and says, Don't worry, you won't fall. And she casts, um, Cure-- whatever, fucking-- (all laugh) I'm not even looking at them-- Cure-- He-- no, no, no, I gave them back to Ashley! Yeah, but as Pike, Cure-- okay, but Pike, she can do it better than Vex can. That way you're standing and you don't have to wobble out. Grog. That was fucking amazing. Wait! Look at your gauntlets! They're glowing! What does it mean? What's it do, what's it do? Oh shit, imagine if we had done that before we went after the dragons. Damn. Sick! Maybe we can find an old building and you can just destroy it. It was really hard to not. For a second there, Grog. For a second. Well, a couple of seconds. Well, no, I did, did you not see? Your back was turned for so much of the time. Well, I mean, we're outside. All right. I know, he would've loved that. I feel like we should go celebrate and drink, but it wouldn't feel right without him. Right. I think that would be good. Maybe get some potions before we head out here, because everyone's low. I'll just stop by the store and pick some health potions from where we got them before. I mean we've got fucking shit to sell-- -- and stuff to buy, but that's kind of a thing. That creepy-ass book we need to look at. No, yeah, it's fine, it's fine, I'm just fucking sitting here, no big deal. Shit. A quick buying of potions, I just wanna see if I can get some stuff. I should've just shaken that instead of just-- Yeah. 14. Are you the cart guy? Fucking who-- I didn't abuse him. Everyone else abused him. I was very kind to you. See! We're friends, we're all friends here. Yeah. Said he didn't like me very much. TRAVIS AND Just some potions. All right, I'll just stand next to him while you do business with him. Could you understand that? Yeah, yeah, it's just muffled, it's just muffled for him. Stuff to sell. It is so unfortunate. We are saviors of Emon, saviors of the world, really, and he doesn't even care. Oh, is it? You know, I don't like him, I don't even want to buy it from him. No, Grog, please don't. Don't shop without me. No, no, I'm standing here. I can't let you do this. I don't know, me personally, if that is a good amount. But Vex would know, is that a good amount or is that a shit amount? Yeah. But it's not a good price. No, Grog! Grog, Grog, Grog. Grog, do not do this. Please, please, please. I just scoop it back into your little-- hold out your pouch. Huh? I don't want his healing potions. I think those aren't even real healing potions, I think those are probably water colored-- Right. But we can-- Grog, please. And a greater healing potion! Five healing potions really. Yeah, but this guy's mean! That's true. I am a lady, and ladies treat merchants well, and they don't hold grudges, I hear, because they are ladies and they are above it. So here. Take this 1500 gold. I'm going to count it out for you, Grog. It's below him, it's beneath him to count this gold, he's also a Lord. There you are. C'mon Grand Poobah. Oh my god. No, just a couple of times. Just a couple of times. It's the guy. That took advantage of Grog Grog. Was he? Grog, he took advantage of you before-- -- and I didn't like that. Oh? Really? Well, all right then. Thanks, darling. Which one do you want? I cast Cure Wounds on him. Level four, bitch! Whoa. 14, 19. 22. So... who needs the greater? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Percy. Greater? Then I pass out the other healing potions between-- No, you have to be touching your ear. Yeah, we've got our potions. Hey, Keyleth? Sorry, I just-- -- finished buying those potions. So, do you wanna get back to Whitestone? No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. You know what? We've made a lot of money, and-- (laughs) I really do get that thing, though, I really do. But no, I'm okay. We're fine. Everything's fine. Except Scanlan's still unconscious, so maybe we should go see if he's all right? All right. Good, good, you guys didn't seem awkward at all while I walked up. Maybe we should go. Tree. A tree? Can you still do a Tree Stride? Let's do a tree. No, I don't think we have to. Druid magic's different. It's not like-- It's not like showy wizard magic. Yeah. It's like jazz hands. And druid magic is like modern dance. Like a little fart? I just start heading-- -- towards the castle. I start heading towards the castle. Percy knows knows. Where did we leave him, again? His arms are still up? Okay. Jeez. It's up to you, Grog. How you doing, Kaylie? How long has he been like this? Who did this to him? Gross. That's fucking foul, Keyleth. Scanlan! (gasps) You don't remember? No, you killed it, and then we all celebrated, and you had a big orgy. Yeah. But you are not. And that's very important. Kaylie? Thank you. I sit down on the bed with you. Well, it just seemed like the logical thing to do, dear. Right. Well, 'cause you said that-- What! Would you rather she just discover it on her own? This way she-- Scanlan. She came here. She helped bring you back. You know what that means, right? You think it's bad that she cares about you? Scanlan. Scanlan. She thought nothing of you when you met her, all right? The fact that she showed up here and saw that you gave your life for a greater cause? That's so much more important than any promise you made. I think it is. She didn't run away. And after the fact she stayed here and looked after you! Wait. You heard? That's a lie. What do you want us to do? We did get the dog. We did get your dog. We did, I searched-- I thought I did the magic search. Fucking hell. You don't have to, Scanlan. Nobody knew that any of this was going on. How many times have we asked you if you're all right and you just laugh and joke? We can't help you if you don't tell us what's going on. Well, apparently you do, darling. Get used to it. Nobody likes needing someone. You are. Well, maybe you should fucking talk to her. You should! Don't treat her like a fucking sacred object, treat her like a daughter, Scanlan. Is your father still alive? That's why he's an asshole now. (tiredly) No, you're not. Really? Just like that? I grab the Gatestone off the end table where we left it with him and hand it over to you as well. I'd rather it go to you. I just pick up a pillow and throw it at the door. Well, that didn't go like I thought it would. Kinda wish we would've gone drinking in Vasselheim now. (tearily) And he hates us, now. (angrily) Fuck him! Fuck him for not saying anything sooner. And fuck us for not asking. (sniffs) I start cleaning it up. Well, he seemed pretty pissed that I went and got Kaylie, even though he ran away with her at the first chance he had. Pike, are you okay? He says he does. I have no fucking clue. I'm not gonna go anywhere, Keyleth. Obviously. My take-away from Scanlan is that we all talk too much. And I leave the room. And that's where Scanlan's waiting. Blacklight. (laughs) Crying in a corner. He's not! No, he's not! Guys, no. Stop it. I come back and I take that off. I'm like, No, Keyleth, you took that from me when you were drunk last night, actually. How is everyone? Percy. Morning. Squish-squish. Squish-squish. You're still drunk. Sober up. It's a new day. (laughs) Oh, shit! He could've broken his nose just then, I swear. Oh my god. It is. You're up from nine points. Hey, wake up, fuck. Wake up. It's a new day. Open your eyes. Hey. Hey, you're not drunk anymore, look at that. We have to give Ripley's hand to those guys in Marquet. I think that's the easy one. It's super good, Keyleth, really. My brain hurts from crying so much yesterday. Maybe bring Allura and Gilmore in here, because we have that book that seemed very nefarious. No, don't touch it, Grog, I don't trust it. I want Allura or Gilmore to look at it first. Or Eskil. I just keep making people wary of me. Hi. Soul-money. I don't think we do. Not anymore. Let's just keep that in a-- Yeah. I agree. This feels wrong. Can you scry? Yeah. See where he is, what he's doing. And just like project it on the wall behind her so we can watch it like that movie. To see if he senses it, maybe. Wait, what did you roll? No, he walked out in a fucking nightgown. That's good. Just in case. We should've invited Kaylie to come with us. They could've stayed-- Yeah, right. As we head to the tree, I pull Grog aside, and I ask him Are you all right, Grog? I mean, I know, I know you got your lady favors out of the way and all that, but... Scanlan was your bestie, right? Outside of Pike. Well, yeah. Me and Pike? Cause you saw my titties? Yeah. Right. I'm sorry, Grog. Me too. Do you want to see them? Would that make you feel better? Yeah, no, it didn't feel right, I just wanted to... all right. We fucked up. Right. Right, we didn't put on our-- (gasps) Fuck! It's a kleenex, it doesn't work! You piece of shit! Fuck! I didn't want to throw something hard at him. (disgruntled) Oh. 50,000 gold. 50,000 gold an hour. (quietly) Good thinking, Grog. Wow. (sarcastic) They're all very clever. You piece of shit, both of you. I'm so angry at everything right now. How dare you, Samuel? (gasps) He has a new character sheet. I'm going to cry, again. I'm going to cry again. Nope. I hate Tary. He's a dick. A super important mission. What does he have? I walk up to him. What kind of adventurer are you if you've never heard of Vox fucking Machina? Where the fuck have you been? Who are you? No really, who the fuck are you? This armor looks very new. Mm. Oh, I see. The ones that died. Right? Wonderful. That is how you say it. TRAVIS. It's actually nah-jah. Oh, I'm sure you'd take it out in no time, dear. An Immovable Rod? How much money did that cost? That's it?! Well I know, but-- Tell you what, Tary? 50,000 gold and you can follow us right now as we finish this very adventurous errand we're running. 50,000 gold. Small fee. It's so dangerous. We're going into this dangerous-- I'm afraid I can't, it's very-- What? While we go drop off a hand? You think he's replacing Scanlan? This piece of shit would never replace Scanlan. Think about it, for 50,000 gold, we're only 15,000 gold away from getting one of those fucking flaming swords! Look at how fucking cool that rod is! Maybe he is Hotis. I've always known. Let him take credit for the hand. We actually need to because we promised Jarett we would talk to J'mon. Yeah. C'mon, pretty boy, let's go. I hate him so much! Wait, wait, I wanted that gold up front! Well, you carry platinum, how much do you have? Doty, how much platinum does he have on him right now? Doty! Doty, show me the ledger. How much platinum does he have on his person right now? Gold up front or you don't join us. I don't catch the coin. It's a piece of shit silver coin, I don't need your stupid silver coin. Ugh! I will. We're such dicks! You asshole! How dare you? How dare you? I am so angry at you! Whatever! Sam you're the least-- you don't care about any of it! You're a dick! Get him! Get him! He deserves it! LIAM and
