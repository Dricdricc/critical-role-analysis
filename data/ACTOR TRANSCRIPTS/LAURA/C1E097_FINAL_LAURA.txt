Oh, just the same merch news as always. We've got these amazing Vox Machina t-shirts in the store. Yev is wearing it, from Backblaze. But nobody here is, but they're so soft and they're amazing. We also have hoodies and hats and patches and nail wraps and stickers. Yes! Who designed Vox Machina, and that was in our original fan contest that we did. We had that awesome design that was so cool that we decided to make that design, as well. (sings) Amazing job! Oh, can I cast Locate Object and try to find that diamond that he chucked over the side? Yeah, we can fly down on flying brooms. Shit, I don't have my thing. That says what the distance on Locate Object is. Okay, so can I get on my broom and cast it and go try to find it down in the water? Okay. I'm organizing my dice right now! 19! 65 feet. So probably couldn't do it unless I have breathing underwater? She's up top. Would I remember the spot in the fucking water if I went up and got her and brought her back down? Do I have enough time to do it? It's 1,500! Okay. I fly straight up from the spot so I don't lose it. And I say, Keyleth! Can you swim? Can you come help me get this diamond back? I can come-- Oh. Are you really? That's a really high drop! Oh Jesus. Oh no. Oh no. Kiki, don't kill yourself over this rock! Yeah, but you're going to hit rock! What about flying fish or something, so you can maybe-- No, but they got big fins. Are we? She says as she dies on the rocks. Oh no. What is he doing? No. Seriously, though. What if she just died? A Revivify coin! Wait, but here's the thing, do I have to roll if I use the coin? I go fly down there! Is she a body, at least? Can I use my coin that Tary gave me? My coin of Revivify on her? Okay. I do that. Don't touch my dice in anger! I don't know. How do I do it? A wisdom check? (yells) I'm so nervous! Okay. 18. Kiki, that was really, really stupid. I put my hands on both sides of her face and cast Cure Wounds at 4th level. Oh, no! At 3rd level, because I used Grasping Vine last time. Oh my god. Keyleth. Maybe next time you're diving off a cliff, turn into a bird. Yeah. I'm glad you're back. You know what? Let's not even worry about that coin there. I mean the diamond. I feel like, maybe-- Oh my god. I think maybe this is a lesson learned in what is worth risking our lives for. How about you just climb onto the broom. Don't worry about flying right now. We're just going up. We're just going to go up. We're leaving. Price paid, I think. You know what? We're not going to worry about the diamond right now. Yeah, let's just maybe take a moment and recover from that battle which was so hard on everyone. She's fine. She's fine! Maybe, Pike. If you can do a little-- (whispers) Tary! (whispers) I used your coin. I know! You know, those rocks came out of nowhere. I thought you were in the clear, as well. All I saw was Keyleth and then this little tiny fleck of gold and then gone. Do yours, too! I heard "We're gods!" before she hit. Have you died died? Tary died died. Let's go home. I'm not looking at you like anything. You need a bath, is what you need. It's really a lot right now. That's like Keyleth-falling-in-lava bad. Shit. I don't know. Oh yeah, we should probably do that. It's been a couple of days. What did we do with it while we were gone? We really should. To run it if we're not around. (gasps) JB! Well, do you like baking? How are you at math? Fabulous. Let's head there and see how you do. Right, Tary, you would know about hiring people far more than-- Right. That's true, but you were still pretty shitty at it, when we first started. Yeah, because we can eat, too! We don't recognize them. Can we see their face? No! 30. And I don't recognize her. Excuse me? Oh, yeah, no. We were just off on an adventure, but it'll take a little while before the food is ready. Timing is quite-- They're really hard to make. Did you already eat it? I'm going to wait a few minutes to see if Tary looks like he just falls over or anything. No. I'm sure it's not. It was really good? No, she didn't. It's really good. Well, come on inside, Hilda. Let's show you around. Do you live here in Whitestone? I don't trust anybody! It just makes us seem like assholes, because we're like (grumbles). I want to go in a little bit and ask around and see what people think of her. A little background check. Oh my gosh! I really do, but you guys did such an amazing job, though. Yeah, we know Keeper Yennen. What was he doing? Keyleth? I whisper to her. Keyleth, can you scry on people we don't know? Hilda? Would you like us to check and see if we can potentially find him? Well, if you have something of his that we can look at, we might be able to help. How do we feel about her? I mean, she's a really good baker. But maybe JB can handle the books, and she can handle the baking. Well, okay. That's true. You could run the bakery during the day. Timer's done! I'm watching where Hilda is running. No! Yeah, so Keyleth, if you like do read it and you see it's super bad, don't-- But right now? Well, then we go try to help him, maybe. That's what we do, Tary! Sure. Keyleth? She's fine. Of course. Take the evening. Sure, yeah. One of us will be back here tomorrow as well. Well, shit. Tary. Maybe you and I can take a stroll up by her abode. And just see. Make sure she's all right and-- Come on! We don't trust anyone There's no way to know. She could just be in here trying to get close to Vox Machina before she takes us all down like Raishan. She could! We go by her hovel. She's changing. Crying, naked. There's not even a bed in there? Just a stool? No, I'm going to go talk to Keeper Yennen. It's our fucking business, you know? Yeah. Come on, at least we aren't trying to like ambush her and attack her like we attacked you, Tary. Can I ask you a question, Keeper? Oh shit, yeah, sorry. Keeper-in-training, is Keeper Yennen here? Oh shit. It's really that late? Oh, he's very old. I'm so sorry to wake you. Oh, I feel like a dick. I just wanted to ask you about someone you might know. Hilda? What do you know about her? How long have you known her? 15 years? She's been here 15 years? Yeah. All right. What was he like? What is he like? He's a sailor. Well, that was helpful. Anything remarkable? Any sort of untrustworthiness? Do you think she's fine? She's cool? Everything's fine. You know, we're just weird people right now. It's great. Thank you so much. Get some rest. I'm so sorry to bother you. We're making assholes of ourselves. Fine. We'll go meet up with everyone else. She's a loner. She's lived here for 15 years, but nobody really knows anything. Who knows? She doesn't have a bed. It's like Skyrim, y'all. There's a stool and a cheese wheel. Well, this was productive. Right. Grog you can do the "ch?" What book are you reading that's about boysness and orchids? Boysness. Sexy pictures. Is she staying in the castle, right? Well, I go with you. Percy? The crystal that Lillith gave you. Does that work across planes? Okay. To be honest, it intimidates me quite a bit. What do I see? Can I use my oracle arrow and shoot it into it? And see through the arrow. Okay. What do I do? Okay. Yeah. We'll back up as far as we can so I can still hit the thing. It is a magical arrow, and this thing cuts out all the magic but maybe once it goes through the siphon, maybe I'll still be able to use it? Yeah, we'll stand outside of the door. I have two per short rest. With disadvantage. I am sharpshooter. So disadvantage? 30. It is the Critical Role dice. Can I have a pencil! I got to write this shit down. Pencil! I got to write it down or else I'll forget! Oh my god. Percy! I saw something! I did! I think it was another plane. Otherwise, I could just tell you what I sort of saw, but I heard a lot of "Backblaze!" in the background. Don't we know something about obsidian-- No. This is way bigger. Okay. I'm glad I remembered that correctly because I was remembering it as a citadel and it's just a tower. Does it sound like anything you know? I guess so. Yeah. But, wait. Actually, Percy? Off-subject, but, when I saw Keyleth, I mean, she was destroyed right? I mean, fucking destroyed. Arms everywhere, limbs broken, just terrible. We put her back together like we always do, but I can't get Scanlan out of my mind. It's so random, I know, but what if that happened to him and we're not with him? No one's there to cast Revivify. Have you scryed on him again? All right. I don't know why he's on my mind. Obviously, we have much bigger things. Not good at quiet I think we are, who knows what this will lead to. Yes. I don't know if I'm going to be able to sleep tonight! Yes, from the exalted weapon that I got from Saundor. Yes, and it has the ability to shoot arrows that see. Right, so I shot it into the orb. And I saw through it. Fucking everything. A sky and an orb and a tower. An obsidian tower like twelve stories tall. Hey, Kiki. Good morning. Destroyed landscape, whole other plane. Very dark, very scary. I think. I assume. Keyleth! We had a breakthrough. The Shadowfell? Oh no. Does Vecna reside there? Fuck. Do you need company? All right. How is Kima? 21. Wait a minute! Did you guys get married? When did it happen?! (laughter) I think it's brilliant. Brilliant. We really should have gone there in the last year. We need to visit Emon. True. Oh! That's true. Oh my god, Keyleth. Eye bogeys, for sure. Well, shit! Well, what do we do now that we know? I guess we just research? Oh shit. Hilda. Did anybody go down to the bakery? Yeah, but-- okay. Where is Tary? Did he leave a note? Oh my god, did Hilda do something? Doty? Doty! Shit! What book? Oh! I go look at Doty's book! I'm searching around the room, looking for any sign of Tary. Should we take it off? Maybe don't touch it. Abjuration? I have no idea what that word means, either. Yeah, what is it? What kind of school is it? Shit. Shit, we just sent Allura away. Fuck. Balls. I don't know. Wait, go check the bakery. Will someone go check the bakery? Do I see any trace of him? 15. Keyleth! Focus. Somebody that was in the castle did this? In my house? Did you end up opening the thing? Can you see Doty's book? The top sheet is gone from the bed. Is it an eyelash? Do I get a wish? Wait, get it so that I can make a wish. Keyleth, scry on Tary. Pike, did you find anything at the bakery? The bakery looks normal? Keyleth, come out of the room with me. (gasps) Somebody boobytrapped Doty. Can you scry on Taryon? Scry on Taryon. He's missing. He's missing. Somebody broke in and took him. I go around and start asking-- no, I'm going to stay right here. Will you scry on him? I need to find out what happened. Okay, Scanlan left on his own. Tary didn't. He left Doty here. There is no way this was not foul play. No, me and you, we went outside. We're not in the room. You're scrying. Will you scry? Doty? Doty, come here. Doty belonged to him. Scry with Doty. Doty? Will you kneel down, please? Fuck. Do you know what is happening right now? What did you see? Where is he? Who has him? Who, what-- Slap her across the face. Hey! Okay. Can you fucking calm down and tell me what you saw? Is he in trouble? Is he in danger? Is it close by? The drow? (gasps) She was bringing him home? To his piece of shit family? We have to get him. We have to help him. He's very rich. I'm sure his family is just looking for him. Yeah, on his dangling earring. I thought it was a thousand feet range. Which is still very, very close. Okay wait, what if I use primeval awareness-- I can't search out a drow. No, fuck. Can I look around to see if there's any tracks or any hint of anything that she may have dropped in the room or anything that he might have dropped? She bamfed out. She's got magic. She could be anywhere. Are we sure she was at an inn? But she didn't leave the room. Doty? Do you know how to find Tary? Yes. Can you find him? Are you drawn to him? Try it. Give him the book. Give him some paper and a pencil. Oh fuck. Yeah. Okay. We go and search Hilda's house. Does Trinket smell-- We go in-- Wait! Sorry. Check for traps. Right. Do you want to work in a bakery? Just kidding. We were in the middle of something; we'll talk to you later! (laughter) Perception? That is 24! Yeah! Where did it go? Motherfucker. This is terrible. I feel like we did this to him. He's just so vulnerable. Come on! They're going to Wildmount. Where is he? Well, yes, we knew that! Wildmount. You don't know where any trees are in Wildmount? Doty's book? He might have written some things about it. No, just bamf there. Scry on her again! Sure. Oh, you already used it on Allura. So we have two. Let's do it! Let's look in the Doty book real fast. Towards the beginning. Why can't anybody be nice? The chat did this to us? You turned our own bakery against us! You! (mocking) Prize. Running around like crazy people. All right, so which way is Wildmount? Let's go. Especially if we're in like fart form. Harsh? Super. Right? I mean, he's not the most powerful guy, but he does well for himself. He runs an area. And his sister's name is? Maryanne. That's creative. Okay. All right. And his mom is Mariya. (laughs) All right. Mariya and Howaardt Darrington. See, I know his mother's name! I mean, yeah, he doesn't respond to us. I can't put him in the necklace! He won't go in the necklace! I tried before. He doesn't go. Carry the three. That smoke plume definitely-- Do we have normal mental thoughts when we're smoke plumes? Or do we just think in terms of (wind noises)? What does it sound like if you laugh? LIAM and Sorry. We're going. Ditto. 22. Can I fly down and see if I see any signs along the road? Any markers saying what city it is? But nobody on horseback? At this point, I feel like our option is only to go towards the house, if we can find his family's keep. I don't know. There's no way to know. Yeah. Maybe the edge of town, into the Siren Gate Forest. Well! Anybody see anything? Like we did with Whitestone or something? I mean, it's just horse tracks, but I can look. Horse tracks on a main road. Unless Tary is thinking and he's leaving something behind so that we can track him. Tary? Good idea, Percy! I'm going to cast Locate-- oh, should I do that? Should I waste it right now? Ten minutes. I'm going to try. Wait, a thousand feet. That's not very far, compared to where the city is. Okay. Let's do that. I'm going to try to locate his dangly earring. His penis! ASHLEY, TRAVIS, and I know, it's something. Yes. Okay. So we're going to misty form towards the city and see if we can... Okay. So we're less noticeable? Ping! No pings? Okay. We're over his family's keep? Okay. I think we beat him. Maybe we beat him. Back out to the fucking woods? Or she took off all of his clothing and he's riding around naked. Yeah, hopefully. Okay, then let's scry one more time and see if we beat them. Scry! And he has his clothing on. Good. That's good. Yeah, let's intercept them. (whoosh) We're trying to signal everyone! Oh! But wait! Turn back into-- wait-- I turn back into a thing! They're up ahead! Maybe we should just bamf here, be solid. I can disguise the landscape and we can ambush her! So I do that. As she's saying that, I start using-- Oh god. What do we do? She knows all of us. Who wants to stand in the middle of the road? I bamf Trinket out! And we get in the grass and stealth. I cast Pass Without a Trace! Natural 20! Oh, he got a 19, which is a crit for him! That sucks. 19! Oh. Well, still. Plus ten! I don't know! Plus ten! Ditto! Motherfucker! She's going around us? We'll heal it! We'll heal it so good! Is that a lot for a horse? I'm brooming. 26. Can I shoot her with an arrow? I want to try to go for a shot. Or let your players spread them out and not keep them all for themselves. Salty. Oh no. Yeah, I know. That was 19. The first, and then more than that on the second. Oh, is it too late to say I want one to be a bramble shot? Yeah! Okay! Oh, sweet! DC of 17. She's restrained! 12, 13. 13 plus eight is 21. 21 plus eight is 29, plus 1d6 lightning damage. 29 plus six is 35! 35 on the first shot. And then 16. 24 on the second, and I was wrong, add two more to the first shot because I forgot I was using my bracers. 17. Can I land? I'm grabbing the thing that she was trying to grab. Can I pick it up? I'll pocket that shit. We're here, aren't we? Your breath smells disgusting right now. Just to find him? And bring him back? How much were you being paid? I want to know how much he's worth. You know his father has way more money than that. How long ago did he send you? It took that long to find him? Does anyone in this town, Deastok, know about Whitestone? Know where you found him? What guild do you work for? Can I insight check her? She's so cool. 17. Did you leave suddenly, without any word, or did they know you were leaving? What happens if you don't deliver your quarry? Oh shit! These are good arrows. Just noticed the good work, that's all. I show her one of my owlbear arrows. I know. (laughter) No, he should have offered way more money for you. Well, we don't want to give her 5,000 gold. We want your dad to have to give her 5,000 gold. Should we all be in disguise? I think that's a wonderful idea. We are. We want you to find someone. That's a good apology. She might need it. Well, I want you to look at them. I want to know what it is. And then you'll help us out. Well, I'm going to shake her hand before-- shit. Yeah! Our friend. He could be dead. It was a cube, Tary. Like a cube. What if he's dead? Yeah, I know, right? You'll hang out, though? You're not going to disappear? Tary? I'm sorry. Well, you know. It's how we all started out, really. Okay. Can I be on broom, too, though? Flying V behind you. I know, she got rattled. What is this syndicate you speak of? How much debt are we talking? Well. That's a lot. What if we just wipe out the Myriad? This Korshad, and the Myriad, where do you meet with him? And I'm asking to speak with the Many? All right. Do we leave the room? So here's the thing, though. You said he like hated you, and he didn't seem like he hated you at all! Well, you can't marry that bitch. Grog. You're getting so smart, Grog! So smart. He wasn't with us yet. We had that other guy he was playing. (laughter) How much money did you take when you left? But, I mean, considering the debt that they're in. Well, we have a lot more than that in our party fund. Maybe she's a really cool girl that won't be into you and you can just hang out and be besties? Hey! No, she's in a whole other town. Deep. Because you gave it all away. It's the best thing. I'm really wishing we had taken a lot more money from Thordak. If we had taken more money, everything would be fine right now. Yes, let's go talk to the Many. That's right. You'd be amazing. Maybe we just talk to the Myriad, talk to Korshad and see what we can do. Maybe he needs something, and we can provide it. Just next time you get abducted by a bounty hunter, give us some warning, would you? That would be a good idea. I thought you liked that hat. Your dad is not what I expected! Ugh! Matthew Mercer. You have a way of taking our backstories that we think we've created and then just flipping it on us. Damn it! (laughs) How many hit points do you have? We all have shitty families. Yeah, Mom was real great. What? Should have stuck the landing.
