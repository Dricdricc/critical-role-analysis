Be stressed. Very, very stressed. It was so fabulous, Matt! It's all a surprise for us. Oh, I have an announcement! Wait, but I don't think I have it with me! It is that! Okay. I'm ready. Okay, it's my turn? Da da-da da! We have new merch in the store now! We've been waiting on these ones for so long, and they're finally here! It's so beautiful. This is the artwork that's on my save screen on my phone. It's been that way for a long-- me and Ashley both. We're in love with this art. It's got pages so you can take all your personal D&D notes in here. That's why we did it. And it goes with our pencil set, so you can have, you know. You can have one, Jen, if you want! So yeah, go check it out! It's in the store now! Yes, and so we had to put it on a notebook. And doesn't it look so perfect? It's so perfect. And by the way, it's the Feywild! Yeah, and it's shiny. I don't know if you can see it, but there's a little shimmer. If you're so inclined. We love SacAnime. It's great. Sure is chilly in this place, huh? Woo! Maybe you can add another log, there? Yeah, in that hearth. Thanks! You are quite handsome. Oh, hi! My name is Greldamine Clypsol. I'm a gnome mage. I am short, even for a gnome; I know. That's fine. I wear my hair in a high bun. It's brown. I'm just the biggest fan of Jaina Proudmore. I think she's just the most amazing mage I've ever seen, you know. I hear good things about her. She's so powerful and beautiful. Sounds amazing, I hear. I don't know, I haven't met her in person. It's beautiful. Quazirat Toes? What's your handle? Creative. I like it. That sounds great. Of course!LAURA,  Oh!, TALIESIN, TALIESIN Even your fat stores? That'd be great! Do you have robes? I'm partial to purple. This sounds fun! Wental, you can count on us! I jump on top of the table and raise my fist into the air. Candles! Great. Maybe to the shed since it's close. Thank you. You have tentacles?! You have tentacles on your chin? Warm it up, guys! Does anyone know that you make candles? Other than your father? Oh, okay. So you don't have any candle enemies? And are your candles scented? Do most of them smell like animal fat? Were you going to track them? Is that with your Grog dice? Yes, we're clearly much more experienced fighters than you are. How big is the recess? Oh. That's small for a human. So I wonder if these creatures who stole the candles are smaller than humans. Oh, or that. Greldamine. It's okay, it's a hard name. Especially for elves. (laughter) I could. Should I go in? Should we all go in? Gladly. Can we move these thorny bushes out of the way though? Wental, are you coming with us? Of course, yes, don't worry. Hello! Yes, but I also have Light! And I send Light down the tunnel. Can I do that? Can I send Light down the tunnel or does it light up around me? Oh, what do we have on us? Oh. Well we should probably just use a torch then. Oh! I'll pick up a rock and cast Light on the rock! That was a good idea, Whatever-Your-Toes! I'll go first. Oh jeez, this is so dumb that I'm in the front. MATT and With my 37 hit points. Okay. Shh! Can I hear anything? Ooh! 23. What is that? Oh yeah, you can stealth. We can all try to stealth right now if you want to. Maybe you'll roll a 20. 13. Like five feet? Should we jump down? Ooh. Does it? Yeah, no, we're following, we're following. Yeah. (whispering) What does it look like? No! That's really cute. How tall are they? So they're taller than I am. I put my rock out. Yeah. What should we do? How many of them are there? TALIESIN and Nine? There's about nine of them. Okay. Do you think we could take nine of them? Has anybody tried talking to kobolds before? An entire shed's worth! I wonder if these are actual candles or if these are old candles and they stole his candles for new candles because the candles on their head are wearing down, do you know what I mean? I can be invisible. Sure. Sure! I cast Invisibility on myself. Okay. I'm going to walk across the bridge now. Yeah. I'll be quiet once I get towards the bridge. I walk towards one of the rickety bridges. Ooh. Yeah. 22. Oh, natural 20! Ha! Oh no! Oh god, and I start backing up towards my companions. I run towards them and say They're on their way over here! They're going to blow things up! I think the big one has the bag of candles on his back! Yeah, he said something about blowing things up! I'm right here! I punch him in the knee. I could've punched something else. We can do it! What if we take out one of the bridges while they're on the bridge?! Cut the rope and then some of them that are on the bridge will fall! Quick! Go cut the bridge! Cut the rope on the bridge! Probably 1d6. 2d6 maybe? 4d6?! What level are we?! Oh shit. Oh. Lohkor. 13. Lies. 12. I'm naming you Toes, because that's all I can remember. 18. Okay, it's Greldamine. Are any of them in a line? Are they on the bridge still? And then the big one? Okay, and the big one, is he lined up with a bridge, or is he between the bridges? Okay. Okay. For fear of damaging the perhaps bag of candles on the big one's back, that would be bad, I'm going to cast Burning Hands towards one of the bridges with two of the things on it. The left! (screams) My DC is 16. Okay. 3d6 fire damage. And it sets things on fire. Nine damage. I'm going to run away from the bridge and hide behind Lohkor's legs. Oh, I did? Great! Can I move at all? I'll back up five feet. Shit! I was? Oh, I was. Oh. Yeah, leave me alone next to it, thank you. Thank you for the good advice. Chop his head off! Oh no, this is bad. 15. Across the bridge, right? 19. Oh, I forgot to do this. And I cast Mage Armor on myself. Why do we need to do that? Did he really? Can I use Firebolt at it? Oh, I mean sure, if that sounds good to you! I'm a rage monster. I just like to kill things! Go for it. You understand what he's saying? Because I can't tell at all. Does the king have all of our candles? Lots of candles. We should talk to him. What about now? I like him. Can we keep him? I pull out some beef jerky and hand it to him. Aw, heal him, please? His poor hands! If you want. What? Oh, well, all right. I don't think he's much of a pet. He's more of a companion. I will in a little bit. What's your name? Reeksus. You got it. That's important. Should I light up a rock again? They're quite tasty, actually. Ooh, yeah. Hey, Reeksus. I give him a little bit of beef jerky. Okay. Do you want to go in front of us and lead the way to your king? Is it bad to touch it? Oh. Do you want me to set these on fire? Because I have some. I mean, is it safe to burn? What if it sets off a poison when they're on fire? I've heard that burning mushrooms could get you, you know-- Oh, it's not fumes? TALIESIN, LIAM and Oh! I wouldn't know. They don't allow that kind of stuff at mage school. Okay! I'm going to go through! Wait, am I going to burn it? I'm going to get to the other side and then I'm going to try to burn it. I don't want to burn Reeks. Okay. I go to the other side. All right. Woo-hoo! What is that, 18 or 19? 18 plus dexterity. 21. Should I try to burn them now? What do you guys think? It's ranged about eight. I don't know what that means. No, Fire Bolt. And then I'll hit it because I can do cantrips a lot, right? Fuck-- I mean heck yeah! I'm going to do-- They don't curse in mage school. I'm sorry about that. They smack your hands. I'll tell you that much. I'm going to cast Fire Bolt at the mushrooms. That gives me 2d10 fire damage. Okay, good! I do the same thing on all of the mushrooms that are along the path. Yes. But I went through, remember? I went through and I'm holding the rope on my side. What? Hold on. They're coming? Okay, I go over to Reek. Well, what do they do? I don't understand what he just told me. You have that much gold? That's a good topping. You be nice to him! It's good for digestion I hear. Ooh, it's a gamble. Yeah, he got the blue. Ooh, at least it healed you while it poisoned you. Oh no. No! I use Prestidigitation and create light flares around him. If they're already tripping can we say Whoa, why are you holding that snake in your hand? Please! Oh no, 11. We should back away slowly. Reeks, if we leave them, will you keep guiding the way? What's it saying? Magic? I do magic! Well, I'm pretty blossomed already, but okay. Fancy! Notebooks in the store! Yay! Should I read it out loud? I have acquired Aluneth. "This ancient, extremely powerful staff was once owned by "Aegwynn." Egwin. Agewin. "The only female guardian of Tirisfal. This staff carries a mind far more ancient than most "things in Azeroth." My spell attack rolls gain a +3 to hit. Whenever I deal damage, I deal two additional hit points of force damage. That's amazing. They're pretty cool, actually. Well, some of them. What? What are you talking about? Oh, no! It's the staff! It has a voice! It said that I'm really amazing and that I'm going to do good things. I think that it's like a really powerful weapon. It's like the kind of thing you take with you for several levels at least. That's probably what it is. That's possible. My mama and papa are very proud of me. Is it a he? I don't know. Oh, him? Not staff. I'm confused. Yeah. Hey, Reeks? Which direction is your king? Hey, look! Your hands are working again! Oh, Okay, well, we'll figure it out. Straight across? They're laying a trap. I'll bet you anything. Wait! But you just said there's a big pile of metal in the middle, and two creatures hiding! What if they're waiting to explode the middle? That's intimidating. What about the two things laying in wait? Were they setting a trap? They were undead? Just dead. We should definitely check it out. But there's a giant flame monster. How are we going to beat him? You think that would work? I'm not very good at jumping, but I can cast Fly on myself. Reeks? Well... Hey, that's a good point. Reeks? Why didn't you warn us about the giant monster in the middle there? Did you? What happened to your voice? That's deep. Maybe they just fell, and they couldn't climb back up. Yeah! Over to the alcove? I can try. Okay. What did you say? Yeah, how do you make him go back to sleep? Okay. Tell you what, Lohkor. Will you hold his leash, please? I'm going to fly! I know exactly how to do it. Ten minutes! Sure, yeah, I'm going to fly. And I'm going to try to go over to that little alcove and see what happens. And I'm giving the creature a wide berth. 17. I'm sorry you had a tragic ending. I'm going to keep flying around them. I don't want to touch my feet to the ground, in case something comes out of the ground. But I'm going to dig through all of their shit and see what I can find. Goodbye. I hold it aloft. I found a weapon. I'll bring it back over to you guys. I'm not going to keep it. I'm going to give it away. I wave it towards the creature as I fly by, but I don't get close enough to really do anything. Which one of you would like this beautiful blade? It's a staff. Oh mighty Aluneth, do you have anything to say about where we are? It talks, I swear. Yes. How long since you walked its surface? I mean, I know, I've heard about Aluneth before. It's very ancient. Long time. You want me to go over to the collapse? Oh, okay! I'm going to fly over to the collapsed area, because I've still got a little time left, right? And I land. Now what do you want me to do? Wait, I'll wave my arms so he walks toward me. Is an elemental considered a monster? Is that an actual blade in the game? Please make it an actual weapon in the game. Straight through, I think! I mean, that's what Reek said. No! He's very trustworthy. Yay! He lied to me! He's telling the truth! Do you like us? Aww. Do you like me? I'll take it! I think I'm running out of my ten minutes. I need to stand up and I need to fly away from this place, or else I'm going to be stranded on this side! Yeah, that's what I'm going to do, but I want to fly around to the other side. What are you going to do? Oh, he ran backwards? Okay, I have an idea. Is he considered fighting us right now, or is he just staring? Okay, then I'm going to cast Charm Monster on the creature. It is. Woo! You love us! We're really great! Let us pass! Your mama loves you very much. Your papa's very proud of you. Come on, you guys. Nobody attack him, guys. If anybody touches him, this is going to break. Can you talk, magma monster? You know what friends do? They dance. Friends dance with each other. We should dance. Yeah. I guess we can go, you guys. See you later. Have you ever seen a dragon in person? Have you ever seen a dragon? Okay. Great, there's the exit. Sneaking, sneaking. As stealthy as possible. No, no. Don't do it! Okay. Are you going? Okay, I'm going to try to go. Once you're through, and then she's got to go last because she's going to try and steal that dagger. 13. Ten! Well, I'm unconscious! Oh wait, no. Okay, wait, let me do my math because I have my Mage Armor up, which means that my Arcane Ward is active, which means I have 19 hit points on my ward. Yes, so that means there's, how many? 38 minus 19. So 19 left. So I'm still alive! I'm going to stealthily run toward him. 20. This is going to go very badly. We have candles to get! I'm going to hide and not fight a dragon. Yeah! Sure. Oh, I didn't stealth very well. Seven. Everybody rolled shit. Oh no! Oh, they're the only two that can bring our people back! I do. Tell them you're sorry. Yeah. Who else is still in the room? Ten feet away? He is? I'm going to run towards him because he's still unconscious, he's being dragged, right? I'm going to run towards him, ten feet, give him a greater healing potion, 4d4 plus four. No, you roll it. Plus four. 16. And then I'm going to use the remainder of my movement to run back into the tunnel. (yelling) Are you still alive? Good thing you got that dagger, though! Natural 20! What happened to Reeksus? Read it out loud! Attune to that shit! We could rest up. Do you want to? Or we could use our hit dice. If we take a short rest while she attunes. We might need that later. Oh, yeah. We need to actually do that. That's terrible. Should we sit down and heal ourselves? Okay. No, I don't think you have it. All right! I'm back, baby! Can I peek through the little thing? 17 plus five is 22. How far away is the throne? (whispering) You guys, the king is right there! Lots of other dudes in there too. Hey, Aluneth! Should we attack? Can I do that with you? Aluneth is saying destroy them! I don't know. Yeah! Yeah! Should I do a Fireball at the king? An old kobold next to him. I'll let her do the first attack, because you get assassinate, and then I'm going to Fireball immediately after that. Fuck it! Fireball! How many? 8d6? Oh jeez. 24. Oh! Plus two! 26, because I'm attacking with Aluneth. 22. Okay, ooh. How close are they all to each other? Fireball! 34. Oh. I may have melted all of our loot that we were supposed to take back. Yeah, he's getting his wax back, that's the important part! I am going to back away from the little crack in the wall and hide against the wall. No. All of us in this teeny crack? Okay, I guess I will step outside of the crack and try to hide behind a mound of something. (singing) Guiding Bolt up the butt! I did Mage Armor, so I've got 16. That hits. Plus two! Oh god! He's at disadvantage though, because I'm a gnome. I'm very small. With stunned, if you hit him does it break the stun? Or he's-- So you guys, melee attacks are auto-crits on him right now. Dagger, dagger, dagger! It's an auto-crit! Yeah you do, you have to roll to see if it hits. Plus the poison damage? Yeah, that one, that one. Okay. I'm going to try and take his crown off his head since he's stunned. Yeah! Oh wait, no! Can I use Mage Hand to do it? Is that what Mage Hand does? 15? I got his crown! I'm going to run across the room with the Mage Hand following behind me and start trying to bury it in wax on the other side of the room. Yeah. Well you could get a 20. Isn't it? It's an auto-crit? Oh no! Oh, what a concentration check for the Mage Hand? Okay! Okay good! Oh no. I turn and look at it right as it hits me in the face and knocks me out cold. (screams) Oh, it cracks my glasses. Advantage. Yeah. No, it's a crit. Double it. 19. 19 again, you said 21. Yay, I'm alive! Okay. I'm going to use Frost Nova and try to target the fire element and the other little things that are in the room. Ooh. 15. Constitution. My spell DC is 16. Oh, did it go up? No. I'm going to move, I'm going to run towards the latrine. Are there any candles around? Still? Okay. Yeah. At least he can't move, you guys. Are there any more kobolds alive? Okay, well, I'm going to cast Sleep at 2nd-level, so that gives me 7d8 worth of hit dice to knock people out. I'm thinking they're d6, but they're not. (counting) 34. For my movement, I'm going to run towards the latrine. Yeah, and jump in the water. Okay, and I'm going to jump in the water to put myself out. Lohkor. Oh no, unconscious? With my magic wand of missiles-- With my magic wand of missiles, can I use all my charges? I'm going to use all seven charges in the magic wand of missiles, and I'm going to try to hit it. (counting) 20. One more? 21 plus-- Plus nine? Heck yeah! Greldamine. It's fine. It's a hard name. I'm going to cast-- Grandlefarts!-- Sleep again, at 2nd-level. Yeah. That's how many? 7d8? (counting) 25. Oh my gosh! You guys, grab as many candles as you can, and let's get the hell out of here! I don't know! If you damage it, it wakes back up. I'm not exactly sure how this thing works. Let's grab all the candles we can. They might all be completely melted. Can somebody else please make an investigation check? We're searching for candles. Is there a bag I can shove some wax into? It doesn't say. Oh, a minute. Really quickly! Right as we're running out, pour the water on him, and we'll jump in the latrine. Jumping into the latrine! 23. 13. Ten? Does that mean I start floating? Oh no. Do you have Revivify? He died getting your candles. Those creatures, they had melted all of your candles already. We saved as much wax as we could for you. Oh no, poor Toes!
