I am so strong. For a while. What are you-- Oh my god. What your turn-ons are. I know, I know. Was it? Was that it? I have an announcement. I met Sara Bareilles this weekend. Yeah. There was a woo. That's all. That was my whole announcement. I did not cry. Some people that I were with did cry. And I may have held onto her waist like this. Can you see my hand? I was like holding-- I didn't grab her boob, but I grabbed her waist. No, like a real strong hug. Like a real hug. I didn't hover hand it. I didn't hover hand it, I put a hand on her waist. There is photographic evidence. Everything's good. She was like, "Oh my god, I love Critical Role," and I was like, "I "know, right?". That's it, that's my whole announcement. (laughter) Hot! Not your portrait. Yeah. And we're all naked. All right. I had this feeling-- I felt like we were not going to get here. I felt like we were going to show up somewhere else. I don't know why. Keyleth. Clutch. I pop Trinket out and I heal him. Hey! We're safe! It's good. I know. I'm going to do a spell, buddy. I've got a level three. I'm going to do it at level three. Oh my god. (laughter) I think I wasn't even supposed to get three-- I'm only supposed to get two because it's a level three. Whatever. No, I do have a 3rd-level spell so it's-- Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. I'm sorry. I feel a little shaken up from that, I'm sorry. But you have some resting, you know. It is. Why? Do you want to pet him? Yes, you do. Trinket, go show some love. Good-- Happy love. I mean. Ooh-- No-- There it is. It's good that you hummed. It was really good. It was good humming. Yep. No, no, no, he liked it. It was sweet. It's nice not to hear screams of torment at all times. Oh, Tary. Are you all right? (laughs) Dotty. D.T. Dotye. Have you ever lost him before? I'm sorry. Well, he listened probably better than anyone else. Only when you're ready, dear. Was that on your list? Nice! I'm really excited to hear it. That was beautiful. That was-- Yes. Just the smallest of questions, though. The amount that you wrote down, would we be seeing that before you cut off ties? Right. Yeah. I mean, we may be here for a while. Wouldn't it be fun, though, to just set up shop here and hang out-- Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's how you could make some money, maybe tinker for a living. Yeah, thereabouts. A lot of money. That is true, Taryon. You are a pretty boy. Well, you know, you could make a new Doty, maybe a smaller Doty, just to brush hair. That's right, get a little funsy action there. Yeah, yeah, that's good. No, but seriously, though, the money situation though, like, really, you are paying-- No, but, you know, you always said you pay your debts and all that, so you have some, so I just wanted to make sure that that's actually happening. No, because I feel really bad for you, I feel bad about everything, and I'm pretty happy for you for being your own man and all of that, I just want to make sure that-- I can keep track of it for you, gladly! Doubtful. What did you get? Wait, what did you add? What did you add to him? Five and five! What does that mean? I thought you said you had a lot of money! (laughter) Because I'm completely out of character! Okay, no, no, I wasn't Vex then! I didn't read any of that. That's my favorite. Yeah. Well, go get 'em! They'll be happy to have you. That's wonderful. Do you need any help with that? We feel a bit of responsibility for them. Any time. Sorry we couldn't do more. Grayskull is still there! Yeah, yeah, that's pretty awkward. Let's go get him laid. I get on my broom and continue the journey. Hi! We didn't even see you! Oh my god! We went to hell. Really? It probably would have been-- Like, you would have gone evil-evil? That's true, you would have been really hot in your armor. Percy ate a soul! Percy signed a contract with a devil! You go to hell, you sign a contract! Selling his soul. We did, we did. She scries, she sees shit. We're about to get some alcohol, do you want to join us? All the carts. Yeah. Important business of state. Yeah, it's really important. You're so strong! That's right. You could beat me in an arm wrestling match! They're huge. Oh, I'm so sorry. Taryon lost his best friend. The big creepy robot that drew us. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we'll find somebody good. Super, super good. Here? We know Gilmore, he flirts really good. Okay. Right. Okay. Yeah. Ooh, okay. Too muscly? Too bald. Too much body odor. Which one? Got it. So someone more like Keyleth would be along-- someone lithe and sculpted. Oh. That was really uncomfortable. Yeah, or, "I want to mate with you." That's probably bad as well. That's okay, that's all right. That's good. All right, cool, that's good, yeah, that's good. Rejection, rejection, rejection! What does she look like? You've got a good shot over there with that-- She's a female. We really do, that sounds really good. Did she just boop you on the nose? She booped-- I know!! He got booped. Oh my. I'm not trying to-- No, it's still the same thing! Then you pay your debt to us. Yeah! He likes buckets. I feel like us at the table should actually get to rate the come ons. The females should get to rate these. Ooh. She got some experience! What? I mean if you're pursuing like, a flowery lady-- -- who's never met a real man in her life, I'd be honest, flowery would work. Too much. It's too much, dear. Yeah. Just don't, just-- Just right out. This is going to work! So much better! Oh, shit. You're going to lose your jug. That's fucked up. Oh god. Disadvantage. Oh. Yeah, definitely higher than 20. Maybe talk to them. Don't talk at them. Talk to them. Don't talk at them. (laughs) No, that's a question for me, darling. That's so true. I think the lesson went well tonight. How many more things on that list, Tary? Woof. What for? There were really terrible people there. People were being tortured. We saw it happen. Oh! We saw a torture chamber. You would have loved it! I thought of you. No, I almost did, and I felt really weird about it. Yeah. A werebear. Trinket was-- I think he had a bit of a crush. Trinket, did you have a crush on Tova? Oh. Yeah, look at you, asking questions. Was it with Doty? No, it's not judging. It was a terrible joke. He's got really good technique. He always brings a bottle of liquor with him. Wait, what? What? How much older was he than you? Terrible. We should find Lawrence! We should see if we can find him! We should scry on him! Nothing? Can you describe him? Would it work? Real estate. You don't want to be that. I got you, boo. Well, shit. Tary, you don't have to go back to him if you don't want to. You can stay with us. I don't fully agree with that. You did give it away. I think Grog's offering. Oh. Do you go to brothels, Pike? Trish the Dish! You see how she did that? I mean, unless you want you. If that's the way you think you're going to pick up a girl or a guy, maybe that's the way and you'll just find somebody who likes that. You might get a lot of rejection until that point, but eventually you'll find the person that it registers with. You're doing great. I know you did. Are you okay? Do you still? Was it a little painful? You could. He's not going to be into it. Could we get an insight if Taryon seemed excited or just terribly scared? That's better than what I rolled. Not happy? Not happy at all or like cool? This is so uncomfortable to talk about. You could always try following them. I'm going to go make sure everything's okay. I'm going to go listen in and make sure everything's okay. No, of course not. (gasps) Oh, you sneaky fuck! No! Yeah, he's not going to know where we went. Is Shauna around at all? Can I run up and snag her for a second? I feel like it happened. It definitely happened. Question, though. How long does your friend usually stay with her cohorts? Does it-- Is it-- Does she spend the night with them, or is it like an in and out-- Do you see her again, around, quickly? It depends. On the guy. I agree with that sentiment. Thank you for your generosity, and your connections. Also, I'm sorry for my friends, and for me. (laughter) Thank you. I dunno, I think he might be with her a long time. He might be learning a few things. It could take all night. I mean, did it look like he was? Really, really far in for Keyleth, actually. Gross. I like this plan. Yes. Do I need to come with you? You didn't? Did you not see anything? What did you do? You seemed bothered after you looked. Is everything all right? What was he doing? What was he doing? Like what? I sort of gave that to him. I did. Yes. You don't think there's any chance he'll ever come back, do you? You know, it's funny, he left feeling like we didn't appreciate his worth, and these last few weeks have really made me understand how much I did. I think he hit on a lot of really good points when he left us. I don't forgive him for them just yet, but I'm trying not to hate him for it. Not at all, dear. I pull out Fenthras, and I show him again what I've carved on the front of it. Sinaeth. Do you remember when I told you about this? It's important. I struggle with it a lot, you know. I tend to hold grudges. If we're trying, that's important. Just think on it. Nothing rash, dear, all right? Yeah. I'll be in the room. I ran to Jared's. MARISHA AND Jarett. Yes. I have no idea of the responsibilities. In fact, I have no idea what being a lady really means, except for saying I'm a lady every once in a while. Oh! Have all the answers. All right. So I'm like a guard? Destroyer of Worlds? What kind of creatures are we talking? Beholder creatures, or big wolf-type creatures? All right. Yeah! That's no problem. I'm really tough and strong and stuff, so yeah, that sounds fine. When was the last one? Oh. Oh. Just me? MATT AND What about Trinket? Even Keyleth got friends. No? Vex. Obviously! I mean, I'm going to kick serious butt, but what if I don't? What happens then? Do I lose my title? Do I just suck forever? What? Right. When that could-- So wait, has the opportunity presented itself now? Okay. Wonderful. Well, I'm not intimidated by this at all. Great. Great. Yeah, it's fine. By myself. No big deal. No big deal. This is nothing. Right? You're not going to send me out there to die, Percy. Thanks, Tary. Look at you, you're so strong and knowledgeable now. All right. Sure, yeah. Great. Well, I shove a bunch of eggs in my mouth and I get up and I'm going to find Keeper Yennen then. Hi. Vex'ahlia. Lady Vex'ahlia, Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt, apparently, which I'm here to talk to you about. Apparently. Oh? I thought that happened last night, dear. Okay. Okay. That's it, huh? Yeah, this explains so much. It's very clear. So I'm supposed to bring back some sort of trophy, then? That would be good? Right. Right. Right. All right. Well, thank you, Keeper. Thank you. And you! And you. The Dawnfather's Pelor, right? Great. So I'm going to go and sit in front of a tree. I'm going to think real hard. I'm going to talk to a god and then I'm going to go kill something. Potentially. Looking good, Tary, looking good. Well, fuck it. I remember you doing that. I like this! Technically, I'm supposed to be at the base of the tree, right? What if Pelor can't see underground? What if he needs to see me in the sun? I don't know how gods work. I don't know. Solid. I'm just going to walk towards the tree. (laughter) She's going to stay. Yes. Did you want to say something, Percy? I give him a big hug and a kiss. I love you, dear. Thank you. All right, get the fuck away from me. I've got to meditate. I feel itchy, but I'm okay. I'm going to stay still. Okay. He said I'm supposed to meditate on the tree? Or on Pelor? I'm going to try thinking about the tree first. A lot. I'm thinking about the leaves swaying and I think about finding a quarry and, you know, hunting things. Then I'm going to start thinking about what it feels like to walk through the woods barefoot and hear the leaves crunching underneath my feet and hear twigs breaking as I hunt creatures and track them. Okay. I should've learned Speak With Plants from Keyleth. I'm going to sink down and I'm going to take my armor off and try to feel the bark beneath my back. This sucks. Is anybody around that I know? Good. I feel really stupid right now. Fuck! I'm going to try going underneath the tree where Keyleth said. Where the little treehouse was. Yeah, actually. Don't mind me, I just have a treehouse to get to. And I walk through and go under. I don't know, man. 15. I wink at him, keep walking. But you like it. You like it. And I keep going. Joseph? If you could wait at the door, that would be really helpful. Thank you! You're doing good work, Joseph! At the door! (laughs) All right. Keep walking. As I go, I want to put my hands on the roots and I'm going to say, hey, Sun Tree! I know I can't hear you, but I really need your help right now. And I hope you can hear me. I don't know how to do this, exactly, but I need to talk to Pelor, and there's a lot of people that are looking at me like I know what I'm doing, but I have no freaking clue. So if you could help guide me, that would be great. I sit down and I keep my hands on the roots. Yes! God damn it! Ten. Great, Joseph. You know what? Thanks! For everything, have a good night. Okay! I'm great, you can go. You can go. It's not. But don't come down here, thank you. Okay! Is Trinket here with me? Pop that fucker out. Hi! Sorry about that. Are you okay? Are you comfy? Are you all right? Is this too big? How much can you stay still? I'm going to cast Speak with Animals. Trinket? Can you come over here? I'm going to just lay down, dear, I'm just going to lean on you. I just need you right now. Yeah. It's days down here, Trinket. We're imprisoned forever! This fucking title! I thought I wanted it! I thought I did! Yeah, I know! Well, it's not going to be forever, eventually we'll get sick of it, dear. And then we'll leave. I lean back on him and just look up at the roots and say, oh, Pelor! You have something to tell me and I want to hear it! And I'm getting tired of being down here but I swear I'm fine, I'm going to keep concentrating, because I'm committed to you and I'm committed to this Hunt and I'm committed to this title and this city... and your tree, and your leaves, and your trunk, and these roots, and the dirt around me, and all of that. And I'm going to keep thinking. All right! Oh, I thought that was a 20, but it's not. 15. (laughs) It worked! It worked! You are awesome, Sun Tree! You're the best! Pelor, that is some fucked up shit. Okay. Trinket, wake up! We have to go hunt a thing that looks really scary! I'm going to die! How about you? Good call! Let's go! Oh fuck. Do I just fucking go straight for it? I don't know! I don't know how to go find the lake that he came out of! Do I remember what it smelled like? It's really fast, it was going through the trees. Do I remember a specific look? Do I remember hearing about a lake in the woods? Okay, and I definitely put my armor back on. What am I rolling? I'm rolling really great tonight. Which is great! 11. If I turn that way, it'll be coming at me this way. Okay, okay. I'm going to run to Percy. Do I need to-- ooh, am I allowed to ask him? I'm going to run to Percy. At least I got some sleep! I had a vision! Yeah! It looks really, really scary though! So thank you! Okay, I have a question. I saw a lake, a glade, do you know of any? Glass-like. Percy, do you know of anything that's big and tall, around ten feet, has six eyes going straight down in a row in pairs, really thick hide skin, legs like trunks-- Well. Is it usually different creatures? Did that have anything to do with this? Great. Just wondering. Just thought of it. Okay. I might see you later! And I go. Okay, okay, okay, roll good. Roll good, all right? Stop rolling like shit, all right? Oh god, I thought that said a one. Investigation, 24. Fuck. An intelligence check would be 19. Okay. I hop on Trinket's back and we take off. I'm a lady! Oh yeah, because this is my favored terrain! That was the same thing both times. So 22. This is where it was! I remember him jumping into the trees! I cast Pass Without a Trace on myself, and I'm going to stealth after him. I'm going to put him in the locket for the time being. Oh, right! 33. So again, a 24. Oh wait, 22. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. A small poo. It's just gone? Can I look up? It's an open glade, you said? That's okay. I get advantage because that's my favored terrain. That's cocked. I can see that's a four, though. That's worse. But my perception is 13, so that's 15 for perception. Wow. Really? You dicks. Why are you betraying me in this moment that I need you the most? But I'd have to hop down on the ground. I'm still stealthed, though. I'm going to climb down the tree. Oh, that's actually really good. I'm going to take a minute. I don't know what kind of creature it is, though. I don't know if I can use my Primeval Awareness. I'm going to try my Primeval Awareness. Maybe-- I've got aberrations. It's not a celestial, probably. It didn't seem like an elemental. So I've got fiends. Those are guys that come from-- Yeah, the Hells. The aberrations. Fey. LIAM and I'm going to go aberrations. Do I have to choose one? Aberrations are what, like a beholder? I'm going to focus on that. Yeah, so it's within a mile of me. Oh, up to six within my favored terrain. Okay. Can I take another second and think about fiends? No, fey. Gosh darn it! Is there nothing in my Primeval Awareness? Okay. I'm going to see if I can find any tracks. Oh, but that's cocked! It's cocked, but it's a 20, but it's cocked. Okay, that's still good. 24. I roll twice? Do I roll twice? 32. Is it looking at me? Yeah. I'm going to take out an arrow. Oh god. And I'm going to fire a Bramble Shot at the eyes, and I'm Sharpshooter. I mean I get no-- Three-quarter-- Oh! I could, if I didn't put my Hunter's Mark on it, but I'm going to Hunter's Mark him before I do that. Oh, he's huge. Maybe this was a mistake. I should have talked to him. I'm trying to Bramble Shot him. And wait, before I did that, I get my broom ready, and then I'm going to do what I said. Yeah, clever girl! (laughter) I got 29. DC 17. He is not restrained, but he does take an additional 4d8 of damage. Which is right here. Ten, 15, 21 Bramble Shot damage. Yes. Ten, 11, 12, 13, 14. Was this a surprise attack? So isn't that an automatic crit as an Assassin? Plus the what? Arrow damage was two, lightning damage was two. One for Hunter's Mark, and then I get a Sneak Attack on him, too. And then four for that. Plus ten additional for the eight and the two for the bracers. Oh no! Only ten. Oh, wait. Do I get to roll twice because I'm in my favored terrain? It all makes sense now. You can have urban settings as your favored terrain. Ten for initiative. I know, okay, Matthew? Great. That's not a good thing. That hits me. That doesn't hit me. Okay, I'm going to pop Trinket out. Behind him. I'm going to disengage. And bamf up into the sky on my broom. What is that, 30? Yeah, but I want to get up to a tree that's far away from him. I don't want to hang out on the broom, I just want to be high enough that he can't jump up to me right away. You know what I mean? Okay, and then I want to brace myself in a tree, so if I fell off the broom I wouldn't fall onto the ground. Yeah, sure. Yes. He can jump really far, I know. I'm going to shoot him. Twice. But through my Blazing Bowstring. Okay, 25 for the first. Awesome! That's five plus eight is 13, plus four for Hunter's Mark, plus three for Sneak Attack, plus four lightning damage. Plus two for the bracers, so 26 damage. Oh, wait! Plus the Blazing Bowstring, which is another seven! That's fire damage. My Hunter's Mark is in there. And then I'm going to try to do it again. I'm going to try to do the same thing again. That's fucking cocked. 28. 18 for the arrow, plus three lightning damage, plus six for the Hunter's Mark, and I don't get another Sneak Attack. And the Blazing Bowstring is another seven. That's not fucking bad. All I'm going to do is go, you know, you seem like a nice guy. I hate to kill you. (laughter) Trinket gets a swipe at him. I think he likes me, y'all. What is it, a bite attack or a claw attack? Does it matter? A bite attack, then. That is 12 plus nine. 21. Where's my d6? Nine. That hits me, motherfucker. That's great. That is a 34. And he falls to the ground and he hurts himself. Okay. I'm going to do something. This is all fucking concentration, so I can't do shit. I'm going to go up higher. I'm going to hope that I'm going out of his range. Yeah. Okay, and I'm going to shoot him. (laughs) I'm going to shoot him twice! 19? Yes! Okay, that's 16 plus two lightning damage, plus one for Hunter's Mark. But I do get Sneak Attack because Trinket's next to him, right? Well, I run Trinket up to him. How about that? I run Trinket up to him. So a six for the Sneak Attack. Is he prone? I'm going to, for my bonus action, have Trinket attack him with a bite attack before I send off my second arrow. Oh. A 20? 12. That's not 12. That's lower, that's four. That's okay, it was just one anyway. Okay. I don't do that very often. Trinket's attack was 24. Okay. So that's 12 for him. And then I'm going to do my second attack. And that is 20-something, which hits. Okay, okay, okay! I hope he can't get up this high! Ten, 11, 12! Plus four lightning damage! And no Sneak Attack. I say, so I mean, what are you doing out here? I mean, do you work for Pelor? Is this, like, a thing you do all the time? What's your sign? It hits. I know, I'm going to die, I'm going to fall and die if I get knocked off this fucking broom. I should have had a Feast or something before. I should have talked to you, and had you inspire me. Yeah, I should've thought about those things. I was really excited about going and hunting things. Strength check? That's not a 20, that's a ten. To the tree! To another tree! Because it hit me and it kind of changed the trajectory. Trinket sees it happening and he runs over and he saves me and everything's fine and I am still the Grand Mistress. Can I grab it as I'm falling? It gets to attack again even though it threw something? Jesus. Trinket got a natural 20! (cheering) Okay, so that's a bite attack. Triple the dice? Damn it, I was real excited. 16. Ooh. Yeah, that's doubled. He's biting! It's a bite! He's a bear! Thanks, buddy! I say, why are we doing this? Why are we even fighting? Is this a thing? Is this a thing? Should we talk about this? Yeah! No, would I use my whole turn to try to talk to him as I disengage, can I try to stand up-- Oh, fuckballs. That's a bad idea. I roll out of the way of him, right? 'Cause he's looming over me, is he within-- Can I disengage out of this? Great, cool! How the fuck? What the fuck am I going to do? I'm going to-- I mean-- I already used a bonus action to disengage, so I can't take a healing potion. The broom is attached, it's dragging behind me. Yeah, but then he'll just attack me again! I'm going to shoot him. I'm going to commit. I'm going to shoot him twice as I'm staring at him. Say this is-- This is not the kind of Hunt that I am used to! And I try to shoot him. I mean, I guess I don't have any kind of concentration up anymore because I got fucking destroyed. These are all bonus, though. Really, I can't do shit. I kind of suck. Fenthras can do Bramble Shot, which I already did. 17? Misses or hits? Okay. 11, 12. 12 plus one lightning damage. Trinket ran up as I was saying that! Plus two Sneak Attack. Trinket's going to run up and take his swipe while I'm doing this. Oh wait, no, I used my bonus action to disengage. Trinket can't do that. Great, okay. 29. This is bad, this is bad, this is bad, guys. This is super bad. 14, 15, 16, oh, that doesn't count, 16, plus two lightning damage. I'm just going to put my arms down and stare at him. 16. Fuck. Doesn't hit! That definitely hits. Dodge, dodge, dodge, ugh! I don't have Uncanny Dodge yet, that's level five or seven or something. I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive. Oh, it's trying to grapple me? 18. It's okay, neither can I! I'm going to have Trinket run up and I'm going to, fuckin' A, have to disengage, and run the fuck away, 'cause that's all I can do. I'm going to disengage and run as far towards that tree circle as I can. Okay. Yeah. So I want Trinket in front of me, and then I'm going to take two more shots at him. I know, I'm going to die if I don't do this! Okay, that hits, that hits, that's 28. Okay, okay. 12, 13, 14... 14, 15, 16, two for lightning damage, and then six for the Sneak Attack. I don't want it to be fatal. Just the feather end. (laughter) I want to get him in the shoulder, up here. Trinket is standing right in front of him, eyeing him down. And I say, you're a noble creature, sent here for a reason. Yes? You can leave. You can go back to where you came from. I protect this forest now. This is mine. I'm scared of all of my dice right now! Oh god. I know, right? Straight charisma. Seven? I know, right? It's not a saving throw, it's just a check. I'm going to throw up. It can leap? No! It leaves? I take the final arrow before it gets away. 18. I'm going to throw up. Sorry this is so late, guys. 15, 16, 17, plus two lightning damage. Just right between the shoulder blades. I walk up and I scratch Trinket on the head. You did real good there, bud. We're not dead! And I cast Cure Wounds on myself. And then I walk over and try to find a fucking trophy on this guy. I'm just going to cut his hand off. I'm going to cut his hand off, no biggie. Jeez! This was maybe the wrong sort of trophy to grab, okay! Wow. You're really strong, did you know that? And I guess I'm going to-- You don't have to carry it just yet, 'cause I want to set fire to the body and burn it. I'm going to use some of the branches from the trees he fucking knocked over to set a fire around. Well, I'm going to do it in that opening right there. Look at that. I guess I can't, because-- I feel like, as a hunter, I would know how to set a fire to something without setting fucking fire to the trees. I'm good at campfires. Yo! This is survival? 18. I bet everyone thinks we're dead. Hey, Pelor. Pelor? I don't know if I'm saying your name wrong. Thanks for that, and I'll be here next time you send something my way. Who has a mimosa? It's so heavy, I couldn't pick it up! Trinket had to carry it. It was this big weird rhino-y thing with six eyes. I tried to talk to him, but he just didn't want to listen, and I swear, he almost fucking killed me. I didn't want him to know-- I mean, yeah. I set fire to him for you, bud! Wait, I asked you! I asked you before I left, Do you know of anything that's gray with six eyes, and you didn't know, and now you know? He was really, really tough to kill, you guys. If we had been there together, no problem, insta-death. Wait, does that mean it was a good guy? Did I kill a good thing? Does that mean it's got a baby somewhere in the woods and I just didn't know about it? Well, yeah. No, yeah. Yeah. -- of the Grey Hunt, totally. Hey, that makes sense. Yeah. Imma throw up.

Yeah, you know, something very hunt-y, a sort of thing-- And then it just fell a-fucking-part! I mean, no, I killed it, don't worry, but then as I was doing it, I was like, Maybe I shouldn't be killing it? I don't know what I'm supposed to do. And then I tried to talk to it, and it just didn't sound like it was listening to me, and then it went away, and it might have been going away, 'cause I asked it to go away? I mean, how many more times am I going to have to fucking do that? Hopefully not a lot, right? Right. Could be years. Sinaeth. I'm listening. Yes. You look like Mother right now. You do. Keep going.
