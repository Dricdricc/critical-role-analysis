That was the only time he's missed. And Fenthras is a plus five to attack? And plus ten to damage rolls? That blonde hair did something for your complexion, though. Did you think so? Is it maybe because you had a song on there? Thanks, bro. You had a song on there, too, Sam. Yeah, I know you didn't listen to it. There's also a couple more announcements. I know, I know, but these are good. Well, last weekend was PSX and there were a couple awesome projects that were announced there, which is the new Uncharted game! The Lost Legacy! What what what! I play Nadine, what what what! (cheering) Yeah, it was pretty frickin' cool. And those are going to be a long time before they're out, but you know, it's still really awesome. And then! Finishing announcements tonight with some special, special treats, which is-- A Critical Role hat. Yeah, you've been in here the whole time. This is out, in the store, right now, as well as Critical Role dice! So, I have heard tell that if you get these ordered-- if you live in the United States, at least, I'm sorry international Critters-- but if you live in the US then you should be able to get these before Christmas! Yeah, great stocking stuffers, great under the tree presents too. Right? So we have a certain amount. And I by the way rolled these dice, before the show, and I got a critical on my d20, so-- They're in the store right now. There's a limited amount, obviously, like it always is, but! As soon as they're gone we're going to order more. But if you want 'em for Christmas, then you know, probably get them soon. Pure chaos. Oh god, it's all happening! So, what time of day is it right now? Well, we have to go through a tree. Yeah, he's marching to Emon right now. They're meeting the other armies. Trust in them. They're soldiers, they'll be able to find their way. They can all start attacking and we can come in from the bottom. We should probably talk to Gilmore as well, and let him know that he has to fucking join us. Of course. I did divvy up our last potions, I feel like it might be smart to get some more, but the only place to really buy any is Vasselheim. I mean it's the only city still standing that we have access to immediately. We don't have a lot of time. The thing is, I feel like people in Vasselheim said they would help us, but I don't know how they'd get to Emon to help us in time. It's on its way. Yeah. It's made to take on things attacking it. It's not a balloon, actually-- I don't know what he wants. Wait, Travis is watching, so he can just text in, yeah. Grog is thinking about it. Grog is thinking really hard. That's good. Can't Allura send a message to them and let them know what our plan is, and then we don't have to actually bamf there? I feel like what we need to do-- okay, here's what I think our plan should be. I feel like we should tell the armies gathering to prepare to attack. We enter in where the Clasp is; we come in from the bottom up. Exactly. They take on the armies while we head straight to Thordak. We could send a message, or we could bamf there and then bamf another place. It seems a lot of time wasted. I'm sure they hold grudges. Then they'll make us pay? Before we head in. I don't think that's very smart. You said by sunset tomorrow is when they'll be at Emon? Okay. Right. What we need to do is plan a time that they start the attack. They might have some stealthy-- Scry away, Keyleth. Yeah, let's go to the castle. What did you see? Anything good? Are we safe? Do you think Drake would join us? Got it. And Zahra? So maybe we shouldn't ask him. I don't even want Kash to come. I don't even want him around. No, he's got one brown eye and one blue eye, I think. I'm going to go ask Zahra if she'll join us. Can I go talk to Zahra? Scanlan can ask him. It doesn't have to be you. I do want to ask Jarett to come too, though. Darling. I gave an entire bag of jewels to a random efreet. I'm going to go find Zahra. Zahra, dear? Oh! Not much time to sleep, I'm afraid. Yes, and plans are moving ahead much faster than we anticipated. We're marching on Emon tomorrow. That's how it is. All the way. Well, he's terrible. He's even worse than we thought. Armies are marching on the city, and we plan on coming in from underneath, maybe striking at him where he doesn't realize. And we'd like your help, if you're willing. I don't know if we'll succeed, and I'm sure we won't all make it out alive. It's a big ask. I think so. Fuck it. Did you make any dragon arrows? I plan on it. So many drinks. We prepare tonight, and we leave tomorrow, I assume. You know us; we don't have a plan, really. I have no idea what's going on. Be prepared. I'm glad you're joining. I'm sweating for her. (laughter) I can't scooch any more! We're turning into one person. Sorry. It's his own drugs. He's made his own drugs up. Well, Matt made drugs. How much money are you spending? You tell me what you need. You said one basic? That's great. Can I ask a question? With potions, do they stack? Can you take multiple ones and get multiple benefits, or is it like you take one potion and that's the one potion you get to take? Okay. Cool. Just checking. I'm wondering if we should eat a Heroes' Feast tonight, and then just eat one again tomorrow? 'Cause we just don't know what's going to happen during the day anymore. Just a Heroes' Feast every night. Be ready, and just, you know. It's, yeah. We're fine. Either one. We have our potions. Should we split them up? Okay. We have five potions of fire resistance. Yes, because we already had one. Now, we have two superior, five regular healing, and three greater. What we also have is a potion of invulnerability, which is clutch, and a potion of speed. We need to decide who to give the potion of invulnerability to, because it lasts for ten minutes? You can't die, right, when you take it? I mean, can you take damage when you've got it going? It's like a minute of no damage? That's a specific task kind of thing. So we'll decide that later? I can't wield a sword either. The thing is, if he's raging, I don't know if he'll think to switch over. But you can't do three attacks with it, because it's bigger? That's pretty cool. Could he do Whisper and then attack with the dragon sword? What? Whisper is a Vestige. Yes. All of them! All of them! Well, all of them that we know about. That's all we know, is that you fight with them. That's all we know. Why, do you know more? Well, it would mean traveling to Vasselheim. One of us could go and bamf back. And be back tomorrow morning. Not as much as we hoped it would, no. Yeah, potion of speed. Fire resistance? Yeah. I need fire resistance. Oh, yeah, that's right. I could take off my bracers-- Done. And we also find whatever it is he's protecting and kill that too. Hey! What's up? I'm really sorry. About all of that. Oh, I like this plan. He's good. Yeah, that one! Do it! Let's do that, let's do that! We also have another secret weapon! Scanlan, you do remember the flute, right? I wonder how long it'll take? To bamf over when we play the flute? Is it instantaneous or is it like, it takes a day? We'll find out. (laughter) Yeah, no, that's great! Let's do that! Of course. Daxio is going to do that. Yes. He's the leader of the army. Yeah, we need to talk to him. And open the gates? Yeah. You were talking so much a second ago, and-- I think we should send a message through Allura. She can just scribble a note and send it to him. All right, let's go. Right now. I still think we should eat a Heroes' Feast before we go. Just in case. What's the difference, really? Just to be prepared. But the day is almost up. It will protect us all day tomorrow. You don't have to, we have party funds for this, dear. Did you just give me 800? I'm just pocketing your 800, and I'm putting it in the party gold. So thank you. Okay. And Trinket. No. Shh-shhh-- We have to choose between Kima and Jarett to come? Or to eat? Yeah, we do. And then we're immune to fear and poison, right? I'm so hungry now! Oh, that's so comforting. Okay. All right. So if we could get in, talk to the Clasp, and have them find a way to open the gates, it would help the armies. Plus the Clasp, which hopefully will be willing to fight. I think Thordak might be scarier than any of their gods at this point. Well we don't know where they'll be exactly until tomorrow. I do, I have a siege arrow. And Grog does extra damage against buildings and walls. So it damages stone, specifically? The siege arrow? I'm a really good archer. Yeah, oh my god thank you so much. Yes. I like it. These guys are legit! Apparently! Which is terrible. It really, really is. They can go through trees, instant! We need all of the Ashari. I fucking forgot the Ravenites said they would help us, too! I just remembered. How long would it take? Fuck. Are they too far? Are we expecting you back tonight? Yes? She knows everything about all of us, dear. Not even for a minute. I'd rather you didn't. I have to do it, I have to insight check Zahra to make sure she's really Zahra! I love you. When did you even speak to her? Yes? Yes. I know the feeling. (laughs) Especially her. Just know that we don't trust her. I don't even know if she's really sick. I don't think he really can. You're not alone in this, at least. She's not our friend. Hello, who is it? (faux surprise) Percy? Are you here for our later talk? Fine. I open the door completely naked! What was it, dear? Sure, of course! Would you like to talk before, or after? I have a question. I have a question. I'm going to attune the Boots of Haste that I took from my brother just now. That my brother gave to me. And if I un-attune my Coldsnap Armor, do I just lose the cold resistance? That's a big drop. I'm going to take my bracers off, then. Yes. I whisper in my brother's ear. Just be careful because-- What? What? Be careful; I think he has a grudge against you. Just go. You'll be great. (laughs) Oh, shit. They're fighting over you, darling. They're fighting over you. They both professed their love and now they're fighting. Grog has the Bag of Holding, and I don't know what's in it. What color are the robes? Why not via a tree? Well, it's not a battlefield. Right, right. She can take us to Daxio? Question, if you go and you open up a path to the Sun Tree, can people on this side run through the Sun Tree? Yeah, the eight of us need to go. And then how many is that left? And Drake? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He gave it to us. The elite SWAT team, heading in there. This is Kashaw. That would be swell if we can, huh? No, no, no, but we have talked about doing it. What's the weakest wall? We will have air support. Yes. We have a secret entrance in our keep, if we can still access it. If not, there is an entrance to the sewers towards the water. We were told of it by the Clasp, right? Wait, wait, the Traverse Junction. What's the Traverse Junction? That's not what I meant, then. That wasn't the thing that I meant to say. Well. There were. There were about 55 soldiers. That's true. They should be crossing paths very shortly. So after you cut through all of the lizardmen like butter, you'll make your way to Thordak? And Brom. Don't say that word out loud. Yeah, very quietly. So, what, the minute we pop out, we send up a flare? What if we're not in position by sundown? It just has to be subtle, something your dad will recognize, huh? No, no, no, it's Air Ashari. Total chaos. We make our way to Greyskull. I wink. Oh shit. Oh shit, oh shit. You roll a 20. And then you-- Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us? Is it too late? Can I just add it to everybody's if I cast it now? I do. Yeah, it adds ten to all of your rolls. 30. We're making our way to the doorway, we peek in now. Did somebody steal the poop? Don't drink that, Grog. No, none of it. No-- (laughter) We need to pass out these healing potions before we get anywhere. Yeah. All right, we have three greater healings, five regular healings, and two superiors. Who needs what? All right, take one. Okay. He wants one? MATT "Please." Okay, we have one greater left. Five regulars, so I'll pass out regulars to-- Do you need any? You, you-- There's one superior left. Oh, you already have a superior? Oh shit. You have a fuckton of potions! Take the superior, Scanlan. Zero superior and four fire potions. I'm taking one of the fire potions as well, so that's three fire potions left. Yes, two fire potions left. Pike has fire resistance. Of course darling, whatever you need. You want to take two regulars? Now, the potion of invulnerability. Is there someone specific we need to give that to? Does it quarter the damage? I still have it. I didn't give it to him. You don't have it, Grog. You don't have the potion. Oh! Okay, well then he gets the last-- No, no! Grog, wait for when we start fighting Thordak. Some ale. Do you do it now? I'm gonna give-- I don't know if Pike has any healing potions, so I'm gonna give her a regular healing potion just for something. We know where the entrance to the tunnels are, though. Can you do it to all of us? Lizard people can't see through that. How many can you? I want to be invisible! Can we eat a really fast feast? Yes! We would have. Some of us, but I'm invisible because of Gilmore. We could just pop down to a sewer. Do we see a sewer hole? This plan is smart. Wait, once we get to the Clasp, then we have to fucking talk to the Clasp. All right. It's all on Scanlan; he's very charming. Kash, don't talk when we're in there. It was wonderful, and I'm very grateful. I'm very glad you're here, though. Yes, and then we're going to go quickly to the Clasp entrance. No! I don't want to be a lizard person. Don't waste a spell. We do; we all followed Garthok. I tug on Kash's little braid behind him. I'm keeping watch. Grog, help! Lift! Stealthily. Wait, Grog! Put the grate down very quietly! I whisper in his ear. Once we're down in there, I bamf Trinket out of the necklace. I love you very much. And for being such a badass! I creep up next to him. What are they saying? I'm going to roll the Critical Role dice. Oh man! Oh good, that was good! Where's my piece of paper? Perception. That is a 28. Running away from us? And they're heading towards us? Okay. They hate you. Are you true to Emon? And then I took an arrow to the knee. (laughter) Remastered! Yeah, we're still invisible. Garthok? You're invisible, and you're far back. It's not lizardmen. Magic. Oh no! I rolled a 20, and a one. Oh, fuck, what do we do? Somebody-- Drop Seeming, drop Seeming! Drop Seeming, Scanlan! Please, wait! We're not lizardmen. We're still running after them. I like that you're talking to Matt through the earring. Oh, sell them drugs! Half the gold? Half the gold? Holy. I think 12-ish? I like that he goes-- and it's a 20. No. We've got to get to where Thordak is. Grog picks her up, come on! She can probably do it through the grates. As I'm running, I'm dipping arrows in poison. I've got six. Six vials of poison. So that makes six arrows or does that make--? Three? However many I can make during this amount of time. Because I know it only lasts for an hour. So on the tips. Awesome! It's one of those things I meant to do earlier. Can we parkour up? 34. By the way, I was totally going to say I was putting Trinket back in the necklace before you started saying all that, I was just-- It went into it right away. Oh, I want to perception check too. Just because, you know, that 29 isn't going to see everything. Yeah. No, this is a 23. So-- (laughter) Yeah. I mean, we're invisible. About a hundred feet off, clear view. Is it possible to get up and over the wall, away from them? Can I peek my head out--? Or I can fly up to the top of the wall and drop the rope down? Well, what if-- What if I come out, I fly, I move down away from the fire giants, I fly up to the top of the wall and drop the rope down? So everybody can climb up? Maybe make lizard people and then pop over-- What?! I drop the rope down so Grog and Pike and everybody else can go up. Pass Without a Trace that I cast? Yeah-- Can I cast it again? Right, at the keep. Do we get advantage because we're invisible? Ah okay, good. 21. Okay, are we trying to keep stealthed and then letting Zarah and Kash-- I thought we were up and over the wall. I understand. 28. 2d10? We want to take sneak attacks on both of them. First one hits. And then 21, does that hit? Okay, do I get three attacks-- oh, no, no, no, I'm not clicking the boots yet. Augh, what's happening?! So, 15 for the first hit. 22 for the second. And just keep running. Shout out! It's just a buddy cop movie. We were out of time! Are we allowed to say, Brian, that they're going to be on Talks Machina? No, we can't know his secrets just yet! Plus I don't want to know any secrets before we go into this fight.
