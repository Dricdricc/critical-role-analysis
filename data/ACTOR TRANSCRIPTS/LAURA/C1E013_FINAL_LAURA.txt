We're going to be at MetroCon next weekend. (sings) In Tampa, Florida. Ridiculous. We should get out of here! (gasps) We're not around lava now. I was planning on staying up. I'm not leaving Trinket up there. I notch my arrow. She needs better dice. Teleport us out of here! 21. We're all going to die. I'm stuck at the top. Until we can run, we're stuck, because there's only one flying carpet. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the Elder Brain and shoot Hail of Thorns into the Elder Brain. 19? Do I roll regular damage, plus the Hail of Thorns? 39 on the first hit. And then 18 for the second. And anything within five feet takes damage, as well. They take the same amount unless they make-- Oh wait. Yeah. They take half damage on a saving throw. I want to do my second attack. Yeah. 15? I don't know what else to do. I'm stuck up at the top. Just bull rush and tear down the well. We need to get out! Or take down the Elder Brain. Get it, Keyleth. (cheering) Teleport us! Fly us! Get us out. Float it into the Bag of Holding! Don't be a dick. That doesn't miss. You can climb it. He rolled a 20. He's going to try to eat her brain! That's not to Matt, that's to the little brains. No. You could attack with your chain. I am going to attack-- I'm going to put Hunter's Mark on-- oh, my brother just died. On the one attacking Scanlan. 14? But he's bent over and I've got a bird's-eye view of him. Yes! So I just roll again? 22! Right? 11 points of damage? No, I did not. I won't, though. Three extra. That's for Hunter's Mark. Okay. On my second one, should I just try to attack him again, kill him? All right, I'm going to kill him, try to hit him again. 18? 16 plus-- 19. I knew he was going to do that! I totally knew he was going to do that. Kima would help us, but she's stone. Just do the other side! Oh no, we never closed the other door! No, we didn't. Oh no, K'Varn! I can't believe we killed Clarota! No. "Because I didn't help you guys!" Thanks, Tiberius! Yeah, no, go down and save them, honestly, because I'm staying up top for right now, unless we can teleport out. Why? Vax? No, on Pike! You can't? Would he be able to make it? Now we've got to squish those little brains. Oh, this is what happened to Grog! Forever? We should probably get out of here! They're coming up the sides! They're coming up the sides! I thought you had a crush on her? Stomp all over the brain to get to it. I should just stay where I am, right guys? I'm going to do that, yes. Is there any other-- there's just a little brain in there right now? Oh, fuck me. Jesus. We're going to get out of here real fast! You guys are listening to me, right? Because things are coming up the side and we need to get out of here. I don't give a fuck! I'm going to Hunter's Mark a little brain. Or should I keep attacking the Elder Brain? What do you guys think? I know, that's why I'm kind of like, hm. All right. I can do Hail of Thorns on it again, so I'll Hunter's Mark it and then I'll do Hail of Thorns on it. 27. I don't add-- do I add Hunter's Mark to that damage, or just my regular and then that? Okay. 22. 24. Oh, right, because you're right next to it, sorry Keyleth. 14. Sorry. Oh right, you're really, really strong. Okay. So I'll try to-- I guess I'll just attack it again, because I've got nowhere else to go. 17? Oh really, with it oozing out and everything? Fudge! I'm going to climb onto Trinket for some reason, because that makes sense. It's like a jello mold of brains. Yes! Big damage! Get out. They won't see you. Trinket! So I can fly if I'm on Trinket, right? Sweet! You can do it, buddy. You can do it. Yes! Nobody's really low. Yeah. Can you cast something on Kima? Oh, no. We should just keep her stone for now. Yeah, cast it on yourself, man. No, he can't-- Ba dum tss. That's a double standard. Out, out, out! No! How are we going to get out of here? Good thing you healed yourself, Pike! Yeah. That's the second time this round. I'm going to-- (sighs) Is that brain fluid still floating around it? Like, out and stuff? I know. But it might fall and tip. I want to attack the Elder Brain. I'm going to-- I think all I can do is a Conjure Barrage. So it's the cone of attack. So that will get hopefully all the things, because I'm shooting down, right? It's 60 feet. Okay. Yeah, can I do the edge on the brain and get-- All right, let's do that. Okay. Yes, they get saving throws. Okay. But do I have to roll to see if it hits, or it just hits? Oh! Okay, cool. 17? Plus Hunter's Mark? On the Elder Brain. Three additional. Do I get plus two for the bracers on that Conjure Barrage? Okay, so that would've been 19. 19. So then I want to attack the Elder Brain again. 20. All right. 11. Oh, wait, wait! No, lies! 13. Yeah, give it a try! Gross. Whoa! I want to kill it before we leave now. Why a saving throw? Oh, right. No, you've got to hop on the carpet when it comes up. Grab the gnomes! I thought 18 was the number that we were aiming for-- shit. Oh, I understand. We need to go. You can do that? I can fly on Trinket, yeah, everybody's covered, man. Yeah. Not yet. Yeah. I know, I didn't get to-- I know, I didn't use the movement on the last turn. I just didn't say it because I'm an asshole. Ten? On me. Oh. Okay. 11. Oh! I rolled a nine, plus two, plus two. For my ring that I'm wearing. So whatever that was. For me. Which is going to be a major fail because Trinket is the dumbest. (laughter) No, that's a minus four. So that would be a nine for Trinket. Who is, by the way, my only way to get out of here right now. Trinket's a boy. If he's about to die, at least get his gender right. (sings) We've made some enemies. They're coming after us. What is happening right now? (gasps) Greyskull! Run! I hate that phrase. They won't be able to open that back up? Okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Should we wrap it at all? Say hello. Hi! We are affiliated with the king. We were on very secret business for the crown, actually. And that is why you weren't informed of our business. Okay. (laughs) With advantage. That would be a 20-- no. 35. That's not possible. 25. Yes. Of course we will. In the meantime, we'll just go to our Keep that we have in town. You poor thing, you should get out more. Love the hat. Of course. Holy shit, we survived! What was that? What, are we just carrying around this stone Kima with us, or are we taking her back to our-- But we're in town now, so we're safe. Yeah, so it'll be fine. Well, we've got a fucking flying carpet. Yeah, we're in town! Fuck it. Everything's possible. We won't tell her how much time has passed. Do not put her in the Bag of Holding! Do not. (laughter) This is so messed up. Can I hold it for a second? Hope you remember us! That's it? Jarett was the one we appointed as the head guard, right? Captain? I don't remember about the little fellow. Oh, we decided to get a statue for the garden. Put the gun down, Percy. Yeah, they're so cute. All right. That's adorable. He's in bed. Quick question, friends So we kind of started a war, am I right? Kraghammer is potentially in grave danger, am I right? We should probably let them know as soon as possible. He's dead. You don't think they'll come up and attack? Well, you need to share it with us. Tiberius. Little darling! Damn it, he's so cute. I don't know what to do. Why don't we tell them we didn't find it? Why don't we just hide the Horn? She doesn't, she wants to hide it. Maybe she wants to destroy it, maybe she wanted to get it up above ground so she could destroy it. She's a paladin, she's good, paladins are good by-- Some of us truly trusted Clarota. Tiberius, we're sorry to wake you. I just want to hear your lovely little explanation, darling, about what the Horn is and why you don't trust Kima. Please. You haven't told any of us anything. What if they want to destroy it? Question. Why? Wait, but your crushing fist couldn't destroy it, so maybe lava can't destroy it, so maybe it needs something extra special that only they know about. Wind blows. Why don't you trust them? Not the Horn. Why don't you trust Kima? I think they want to destroy it. No, I don't trust it anywhere out of our sight. It's in the bag. I think we should tell her we didn't get it and see what she does. No, we didn't destroy it. We say, "Oh no, they, we got overrun and we had to leave." Or we go, "Oh, well good, then actually we do have it, you can do that." Yeah. Or she might not be able to tell because we're so good at lying. (laughter) I fall asleep on the table. Ugh! Trinket, let's go to bed. That's great. That and Pike's stank from her armor. Gross! A little pile of grossness. Have a good night! I know, I know, but they're sleeping. And it's okay? How are we going to get it out of there? Teleport it, can you pull it out and make sure it's still there and okay? Wait, no, check though, I want to make sure it's okay. But I want to make sure. You just left us? No, we're going to talk to her first. You were drunk, it's okay. You were so drunk. And then run away! It's fine, it's fine, guess what, we are alive. So we killed K'Varn, right? But not before we were overrun with a bunch of evil brothers of his. Hey, right, look at his hat. What exactly was your mission, Kima? Well, thing is, it's not here. Pretty safe. Nothing can touch it. Can I insight? 19. So the other Horn is still safe? Oh, you're in our home. We hurt that Elder Brain real bad, but not bad enough. Okay, that's good. And your Order is what? Right. That's a really good Order, right? No. This could be bad. Kind of uncomfortable. Yeah. She definitely did. It's in a very secure magical item. So she's covered in food as well. Friendzoned! Oh my god, thank god. Yes, we have a guest room. One point, twice. How far away are we from it? Nice. TALIESIN and All right. This! Is! Bonertown! That's an important thing, return postage. Oh, yay Trinket's dice, thank you! I love the haikus! I love them. This is for me? Holy crap! Oh my gosh. You'll always be my Number One. This is from Team Wishlist. Thank you so much! Look at how many daggers he has now! Ludicrous. So cute! Oh, it's got a little deck. Oh, this is for me! Oh my god, this is the best day ever. This will never go in the dice graveyard. This is the coolest thing ever. Let me see! Wow, I got a 20! Oh, I've got to get all my presents in the picture. Awesome! Oh, that's really cool. I'm hashtagging Critmas.
