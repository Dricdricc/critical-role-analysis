Leeloo Dallas Multipass! Sorry, Matt, you were talking. I think May is World of Warcraft, DBZ. It's got all these amazing things and I was like, I'm a part of all of these things and I want it! Well, it's not really hot right now. It's amazing! Yeah, she's a villain, so you get to face off with her. It's really fun. That's right, I remember when we were going in for multiplayer, it was like, we've got several members of Vox Machina as the multiplayer characters, which is pretty ridiculous. Although I did get made fun of already. Some fan pointed out that I looked stupid. (fake cries) It was Sam. It was you, Matt. It was you! Did you just do that at home with a--? 27. Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god. Does the second story of the house that I'm in have windows? Can I see? Can I run up the stairs, then, so I can get a better look at the playing field? Okay. I'm going to-- I'm already hiding, right? Okay, then I'm going to Hunter's Mark Kevdak. And I'm going to hold my turn-- I'm going to hold my turn until it seems like he's better incapacitated or until something happens. I'm going to hold my turn. I think until Scanlan goes. No, he didn't! That's why you shook your fucking head. What is his attack fucking bonus? Seven overall. Plus two necrotic on the first hit. Five necrotic on the second. Plus that would be giving away your hiding. Oh god. For Hold Person, does it un-paralyze him if we hit him? Yay! Me too, but I was in front of you. Oh, five feet. Damn it. Oh, but that's good for Grog. Okay. I'm going to go. Yes. Yes. I'm going to shoot from my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. So that's three attacks on the first attack. Okay, so. So 19 plus 12 probably hits on the first attack. Okay. 19 plus 12 hits on the second. And 17 plus 12 hits on the third? Okay. I'm adjusting my glasses, I'm so nervous. Okay. 28 on the first hit. 21 on the second hit. 16 on the third hit. Oh, but I get another attack, because that's just one attack. My second attack, I'm going to take at Greenbeard, and I'm going to shoot through the flaming bowstring. 17 plus 12 probably hits? 17 plus 12? Okay. Gah! 14 on that one. I hunter's marked, he's hunter's marked already. Not at all. Hunter's Mark! I did it, I swear! Oh, yeah, you did the clicking the boots of haste already. That's it, that's it, that top one. That one. Yeah. Oh my god, he's going to shoot his arm off. C'mon, Pike! Oh yeah, you can still do other things! This is a bonus! You're going to roll, roll for it! I can't even read that. Oh. No! Seriously. Pike, they're all coming for you. Scanlan, would it say 'reaction' here? Unless he's unconscious. Okay. If I aim an arrow, it's at disadvantage? Okay. I'm going to cast, I'm going to cast-- Okay, here's my question. The siege arrow that Percy gave me, is that a magical weapon or a technical weapon? So just structures. So it wouldn't harm people? Not anything crazy? I know I know I know I know. Okay okay okay! Okay! I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns at third level into a group, the group. At Kevdak. Just do it? I'm going to do it at Kevdak and anything that is close to him gets hit. Anything-- At level three. Natural 20. Oh, 3d10? Oh. 20, plus an additional-- oh no, Hunter's Mark dropped because it's a concentration. But I am sneaking-attacking. An additional six. Oh, that's 12 then, because it doubles the dice. So that's 32 points of damage. 15. 15. With inspiration. They're barbarians as well? If I fly on my broom, can I go down and grab Pike? As an action? I mean, as a movement? Okay. I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm going to hide against the window so nobody can see me. Against on-- yeah, like that. Looking up her windskirts? Nice, Percy. He knocks down a tree in the process. Pathetic! That's not bad, that's not bad. Natural one, natural one. She's really little. Oh, that's the one you pushed off the roof. Oh my god. (singing) Natural crit. But you double your dice because it's a natural crit, because he's five feet away. No, just your dice, double your dice. Does he shrink? Dammit. Teeny tiny. Math! Math is fun! You could pick it up. But can you put it in the Bag of Holding? I know, I can't tell if it's actually really warm in here or if we're all just really hot. Yeah, he's gross. He's got mold on his neck. Up in their business? Oh, it fell anyway! It happened. You got your spiritual weapon still. Oh, that's good! Don't you add anything to it? 4d8. Do you add the spell attack bonus to it? Times two. Plus four! That's actually way more organized than I thought it would be. Oh god. What? I thought you said the first one was a crit. That's not concentration, it doesn't do anything. Shit. Shit. Oh my god. This is where it all turns. No! How many people are there? I feel like there's so many more people than there were. Why are you doing this to Pike? Stop hurting her! Why did it all turn? Because he can roll acrobatics just like we can! Okay, he's attacking Percy. Oh. Oh no! Come on, Scanlan. Oh, thank god. Okay. I'm going to fly out of the window on the broom. Out of the window. I'm going to fly down and I'm going to shout, Grog! Raise your arm! And I'm going to go down and I'm going to hit his hand with the Pokeball. I'm above, I want to be high up in the air but low enough that I can reach down and touch the locket to Grog's hand. I know, I know. Wait, all of them can attack, but I'm in the air! With the locket and I hit. I don't hand it to him. I'm putting Grog in the fucking locket. I want to fly by and poof and keep going. It's a wisdom save, but if it's a willing person they can go in. And I want to fly on past and go up to the next roof. Where should I go, where should I go? I'm going to fly back into the-- I'm going to fly around the back of the big building. Yeah. Okay. Hits. It did? What'd you, what'd you give me? Oh, that's right, she gave me a blessing. Oh, okay. It's my armor class. Fuck. Balls. Shit. Mother bitch. Okay. Okay. Okay. Dammit. Okay. Great, cool, great. I'm fine and I'm just going to keep going. Okay. That-- yeah. Oh my god. Ermagerd. Four, right? Oh god. We're going to, we're all going to die. Once we kill him, his gauntlets are going to be there, we have to go in and get his gauntlets. What? 15 hits you? We're fine, we're okay, we're okay? I'm going to start crying. He kicks the hammer. Oh, the Spiritual Weapon! They're all clustered right there. If you have something that does area. Well, Greenbeard can probably heal Kevdak. Scanlan! Don't hurt the innocents! Surprise attack would've been really good on these guys. God. Fuck all of them! That was the first thing we killed in this fight. That is terrible. Two peasants dead. That's true. Like, up and over would probably be better. Yeah. If you're within five feet of him, he doesn't attack. (laughs) Every time. Oh no! Sorry, Grog. I was trying to keep you from dying. No! Shit. Greenbeard. He heals 70 extra hit points? Oh, not 70 percent of his hit points? We can still take him, we can still take him. Don't let him get the gauntlets, Percy! In the kill box, you're going into the kill box? Wait, what? This is heroic death music right now. (laughs) He's saying 'asshole, asshole, asshole'. We're all breaking. That's good! What if we all die and the dragons take over everything? You're a barmaid. Everything's bad unless they've got a red ring around them. Sorro! What are you rolling, what is the damage? That's a lot. All tens. But now he's a tank. Greenbeard's an earth elemental. An archer died! They're all burning to death slowly. Can you see me up in the air? Can you see me in the air? I'm a barbarian. And one of them would get an opportunity now because-- You can do it, Pike! What, why? That's good, that's good. Oh no, was that the little kid? There's so many. They all get to go. Falls right back down like some other loser that I know of. No! He's a scrapper, he's dodgy. No! We didn't save anybody and we killed ourselves. Okay. I'm going to fly over right above Kevdak. Like a good 50 feet. All right. I'm going to Pokeball Grog right out so he can attack straight out of the gate. Just like I would Cannonball Trinket. Can this be my bonus, so I'm dropping him out is the bonus, and then I still can attack? I mean, it's only a locket. It's not like it's a whole move. Okay. No! Then they all get advantages against you again. Does that mean he gets the three 12s again? And then double that? His crits don't get double? Who's next? Oh, I'm still going. It's still my turn! Oh my god. I mean, my only option to heal him is to land and touch him. Well. Fuck it, I'm going to land and touch Grog. I don't know. Do I have that somewhere? Oh wait, wait. I couldn't do anything else? Okay. Then I guess I'm going to stay where I am and-- Jeez. Can I hold my action? I'm going to hold my action until-- Yeah. I'm going to hold my action until Grog is healed. And I-- can I shout anything? I'm going to shout, witness Grog Strongjaw, and bend the knee! Natural 20! (yelling and cheering) No, I hit, I hit, but it was, it was a 20, I swear. But we are so going to loot that. If we survive this. Come on, come on, come on. Can I take a healing potion while they're inside? I'm up on the thing. Kind of like when you're eating lobster, to get the claw out, yeah. No! It's a fucking natural 20. But why does it only happen when it's a story element? Oh, let me take a picture, I'll take a picture. Yeah, yeah. I'm going to land. And I'm going to call Trinket out. Because things happened so fast for him! And there were really strong people! Does it turn him into a zombie, or does it-- Okay, yeah, do that. I'll help. Hey, you already boxed up your stuff. That's good. She was assisting. I was helping with the money. That's lovely. I cast Grasping Vine and lift him up by the neck. Where's your mother, child? Was she here in the square with you? Okay. Well, we'll help you find your family. And maybe while we're there we can see if your grandfather's around. I lift him up and put him on Trinket so we can start walking. Is there anything else to loot off of Kevdak? Gauntlets? (sings) Bag of Holding! Flayed bear tattoo. Got it. Nice. I'm putting that down. Who's these two? Oh, okay. (laughs) Bowing down like he's been knighted. Oh shit, you're right. I mean, do we have to stay in the square, or are we allowed to? Okay. I feel like we should return this little boy to his family. And see if we can find your grandpa. I can't believe we're not all dead. On Trinket. We didn't die! I seriously thought we were all going to die. When he got healed and everything was running-- Oh my god, getting his arms off him, brilliant. This was incredibly stressful. Yeah. So I'm glad we split them up. Getting Grog out. Oh god. Is he? Good job, Matthew Mercer.
