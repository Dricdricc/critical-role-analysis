The third. Hi! Oh, my brother is extra, extra stealth right now. But I play Vex'ahlia, who is a half-elf ranger, and I have an amazing-- -- companion bear named Trinket, who is basically the coolest ever. And he's good at everything he does. I'm okay. But he's excellent. Oh, I didn't say that. Level nine. Oh! Poor Grog! Hey! We're just introducing ourselves, that's all. Oh, hi, Mark, welcome to the game. (laughs) We're all pimping our shizz. Oh, yeah. Episode two just came out. Yes. He's got nobody to blame but himself. Don't talk. I rush down-- -- and slap him on the face a few times. Ohh. Ew. Do any of us know anything about magic that could heal him? Like any spells. I mean-- Thank you, Tiberius. Thank you. Maybe we should try-- Does anybody have any healing? I know Pike isn't here, but-- How-- Can we-- Oh! It's another-- What is it? An ass cloud? Is that what it was? Lovely. Yeah, a constitution saving-- Well, maybe we should sleep. Try to camp for the time-- (gasps) Oh! Right! I forgot about that! We gotta interrogate him! Her. LAURA and And I can speak its language. Hers. Sorry. What? Oh, thank you, wonderful people! What? Thank you, chat room! Vegan pizza? Are you kidding me? Look at those chocolate cakes! Oh. Heal her? We'll heal her after she talks. Don't kill her. I need her. I got up-- What did you do to our friend? What did the brain work do to our friend? What are you here for? What should I fucking ask her? I say that in our language, not-- (all laugh) How do we-- (lowers voice) How do we fix it? No, no! She's only got one hit point left. Don't do that! (all laugh) Ugh. What should we ask her? Who do you work for? You can't understand! Who is K'varn? Does anybody know? I don't know. I don't know. I've got-- Who is K'varn? Argh, who is K'varn? To take the surface back? Is K'varn the one making creepy zombie monsters? Where is K'varn located? Point the direction. What. Is. K'varn? No, you'll tell me now. I slap her across the face. Lightly! Not enough to make her lose a hit point. Break her legs. Leave her here. Heal her. Maybe we should heal her-- And let her lay there. Is that evil? That's pretty evil. My alignment. I'm good. Oh yes! Before we end your life, tell us, have you seen a small halfling? All right. It's your last chance. Give us something useful? And we'll end this painlessly. Don't, and we'll make you suffer. All right. Ooh, my new dice! Ooh! C'mon, baby! Intimidation of 14? (squeaky voice) To assist me? Oh. Oh, okay. Okay, still 14. I should've rolled my other one. To see. Just to see. Okay, can I see if she's lying? All right, cool. Okay, that's way better! 24! (gasps) Yes! We know you're lying! (all laugh) Yes! I don't know what else to ask her, guys. I don't know what else to ask her. We'll rescue her! And we're going to kill your god! (all laugh) That was the worst thing. Good times. Good times, guys. Oh! Should we keep-- I'm going to keep watch. With Trinket. Ooh. How about this? Oh no! Oh, you are! Okay. Wait, wait! I want to check the bodies of the other guys before the-- Yeah. A 20? Right. She had a lot of good stuff on her. Ooh, let me see, let me see. What is it? What! Yes, that's awesome-- Awesome! I'm glad we killed them before they used that on us. No, you're unconscious. Well, yeah. Yeah. Take a nap so that, maybe-- Okay, she's gonna-- Oh, that's true, you should study while we watch. Oh, good! I like it! All right. Oh, man. Pike's missing everything! (sobs) Oh, we are. That's nice. Can I look around and see-- I mean, no! In our area! I'm not gonna wander off, but just to see if I see any kind of anything interesting. I mean, if this is a really old area that I've noticed, it's old, can I see anything cool and old around us? Okay. So I tap my brother and go, look at this. Do you know anything about religion? Let me see. (all laugh) Oh, me too! I know shit about it. It's a really pretty symbol. I know! On a rock. I don't see any cool sparkly things in the mineral deposits? None of that? Damn it! I am about the bling. What? Oh my god, what if you could die while we're sleeping? Ooh! What was the name of the bad guy that she said? Thank you. K'varn. I'm gonna guess that's how you spell it. K'vah? I thought it was K'varn. We're waking up, we're waking up. Don't worry, we are gonna heal you. Something's rumbling? I wasn't paying attention. On healing Grog? I'm not awake yet. So we're awake. Let's heal this guy. Can you heal him? Are we awake? (grunts) Awake. Ah, that was a good nap! I think Grog farted again. Keyleth-- no, what? We need to heal this guy. We're fine! Heal this guy! Grog, just wait a little bit longer. You'll be okay. Yeah! Do it here! How long will this take, Keyleth? Trinket gives her a massage beforehand to loosen her up. There's coffee next to you. You can do this Keyleth! You can do this! Oh my gosh! I think it helped. Stop it. Do I get to assist since I gave him a kiss? Oh god. Save Grog. Save Grog! No! Yes! Come on, Keyleth! Keyleth, Keyleth, Keyleth! What? What was it? Good job, Keyleth! Oh, Siri did, apparently. I think he shit himself while he was unconscious, so that's gotta smell really wonderful. Right. (groans) You're welcome. Oh, why didn't I have Trinket-- Aw. (laughs) Well shit, I guess we should. I think we are all healed up. Did he heal while he was unconscious? How many d12s do you get to roll? You can roll four of them if you need to. You can roll up to nine dice. So we know which tunnel she pointed towards? Can I use tracking and see if I can not only see where the majority of tracks lead to, but see if I can spot the halfling Kima's tracks. Survival? I do! My favored enemies are dragons and demons. Ah, screw that Oh, but I do. Wait. My favored terrain is the Underdark. That doesn't count if it rolls onto a phone? 19 is what I rolled. Oh, okay, I'm gonna stealth too. Natural 20. Oh, that really didn't count. They all sucked, so. I rolled a 16, is that enough to actually stealth? No. We can't see any movement anywhere? And none of that red light is lighting any of this? Can I go up and see if I can get one of those little red rocks? Nah. I don't want to waste the time. What do you think, should I do it? Okay, cool. A lantern. (whispers) Tiberius. Does anybody know-- have we told anybody at home what that actually is? We both have one. It's like a walkie-talkie. Ew. 24. Ooh. Oh. Oh no. You didn't notice that, that's how unperceptive you are. It sucked their brains out. Whatever it was. No, you're not, you're still hanging out-- I'm going to put my finger in the hole. Lovely. Trinket, no, he's not with us. I guess it seems like it's safe enough, right? Around here right now? As silently as possible, you come running up. Brain suckers, something that sucks brains. I don't think I was in that class, actually. Much worse? Exactly. (gasps) What if K'varn is a dragon? What if-- oh wait, I don't know anything about that. What was that symbol anyway, Tiberius? Oh. So it was a good symbol? Okay. Oh! So she probably did that. I understand. Oh no! You could make yourself smarter? How long does it last? Maybe you should wait until we come across something. Yeah, let us lead the way, or whoever's smart. I'm really smart, how smart are you? Who's our smartest person? Who has the highest intelligence here? That's true. 16. But if they take you down-- if they take down your intelligence, then whoever has higher intelligence-- I don't want another catatonic-- all right. All right! Oh no, this music sounds very fighty. Oh no! Yes. To like boost our willpower or something? (gasps) I gave you some mirrors! Do you remember? For looking around corners? It could help! That's good! We could put a mirror-- Right. So what, our option is to keep moving forward, then? All right. As quietly as possible, to keep moving forward. And on the lookout for anything in this ramshackle town. Yes. Oh well, I thought you said it would get ruined if we took it? Oh, well then, fuck it, let's pull it off. It's magical. Possibly. I take it. All the goo. Yes. Thank you! Mm. (gasps) What is it? +2 enchantment to what? Ooh, yeah! Go take that studded leather armor, brother! What did you get? Let me see that. Yeah, so he just took it. He already took it. Damn it! Some of these-- I remember we rolled charisma saving throws, though, for the umbers. They were charisma. All right. Oh yeah? Let's go, let's keep on moving! All right. I'm still tracking, looking for anything interesting. Oh shit! Hey, everybody, calm down. Sh! There's something moving in the distance. Oh god, roll a stealth check. (gasps) Natural 20! MATT and You rolled a six? He rolled a six. (whispers) Sh, figures! Can we scout ahead? We're both really super stealth, can we like-- This feels like The Descent, I don't like this, you guys. (whispers) Oh no. What do the miners look like? Are they-- are they docile, or are they-- do they seem to be fighting back? Grog goes by himself. Yes. I mean how many are there? Like ten or so? And they have a light source with them so we can definitely see them? We have two options. We can fight them. Or follow them. I think we follow them. We gotta wait 'til they cross it, Scanlan. She's trying to do that. I've got an idea. I run back to Grog, stealthed. I get our flying carpet. Gimme the carpet. The carpet. Gimme the carpet. And him. we can both go on the carpet. We just gotta see where they're going! We'll come back and get you. All right, Scanlan. Oh yeah. Okay, so we have an endless rope with us. Okay, so we-- Scanlan, you better be stealthed. Oh, you can hear the rope? We're going next to the bridge. I think we should go down below the bridge. All right, fine, fuck it, go above them. I thought we were still stealthed? 17. Keeping a good distance. Yeah, so we need to stay kind of out of it but see it. It is. Good dialogue! About how many people does it look like-- I mean, how big is this camp? (whispers) Oh, shit. Oh no. How are we-- what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? (sings) A whole new world. (whispers) Okay, so-- Okay. Okay. Well, one of us. Well, one of us. Let's put down. No no no, how are we, like-- At a place where we can land the carpet and stand around. Or should we go back? Okay, are there any-- does it look like-- do we see any cavern openings in the vicinity? Does it look like there's any? But they're blocking it? Or-- How far away is the camp from that? Oh, so we can't get to that. What about-- Do we see any closer-- Under the bridge, are there any openings underneath the bridge that look like-- Yeah. (whoosh) Excuse me. What are we gonna do? Scanlan! All right, I'm down. Should we do it? We drop him off. Should one of us protect him? I mean, we can't go invisible, we can't be as like-- He's sneaky, we can't be as invisible as him. All right. Okay. All right. I go back, thanks. Thanks for sending me back. I go back. (gasps) Yeah we have. Oh god! (whispers) We can't fight these guys. Oh god. Did you choose languages? Oh, god. Oh no! That's a good roll, yo. Ooh! Maybe he can tell us while we are taking a bathroom break? What are we going to do? Has anyone come across these creatures before? These weird tentacle brain guys? A mind flayer? No, Grog! Do you want to be unconscious again? We have to be careful here. How many dwarves did it sound like there were locked in that prison cell? Holy moly, you guys. You guys are amazing! Ah, thank you! I was wanting some ice tea! (gasps) What do we do? At least they'll have to go one at a time, or two at a time across the bridge. Well, I mean, can he fly, or can he levitate? Okay, I like this plan. Or, Scanlan-- Or, what if you let off a stink bomb in the middle of the camp? Some of them would try to leave across the bridge. Yes, Tiberius? Speak your mind. Let's try it! But you've got Feather Fall. You've got Feather Fall! Is that still a thing? But Levitate or something-- but we could tie a rope to you and it can-- -- it makes you really light, and we can just drag you behind us. Yeah, it'll work. In case we destroy the bridge. And you can Fly Trinket, too? Of course. Let's do it! Do it! I feel like we should try to-- Wait, wait! That's true. Maybe we could create a distraction and bring them away from the tunnel's entrance and we can just sneak around them. No? Oh no, he's trying to kill us. All right. It's not-- Yeah. Yeah. Can you send a card that looks like a dragon on the other side, in the tunnel, and then they run towards us. You can make the chasm look like it's solid ground! Make the big chasm look like solid ground. They'll fall off the edge! You better run fast and not get taken! (laughs) It's a big rug on your back. It's a big-ass rug. It'd be like carrying a-- You? You're not-- No, just him. But he's got a rug, he's got the flying carpet. No, we're gonna chop it when they start coming across the bridge. We're hoping that they're gonna just fall off the edge instead. Our side! Oh. Okay. He can cut through that. All right! All right! (laughs) Yeah, no, Grog isn't going, Tiberius is going. Oh my god. What if you-- What! Oh my God. Yes. Are there any big rock formations that I can sort of use as a shelter and kind of stay behind that but also peek around? Oh, on the goblin side? I want to be on our side. No. I thought we were all on the other side of the bridge. You're on the war camp side We're on the goblin side. Yeah. Can she fly? Oh! You can turn into a bird! How long does your spell cast? I mean, your spell last? Shut up. Your illusion spell. So, maybe you should do that-- So, how far does it reach? Okay. (whispers) Wait! No! Make it look like it's really far-- (yells) It looks very realistic. Oh god. (laughs) Oh fuck. (all laugh) Oh gosh. I will find you. Oh god. What are the other ones? Oh my god. Not yet, not yet, not yet. Oh my gosh. Oh god! Oh gosh. Right! Run! Run away! (gasps) You're already back, you're at the bridge! Badass! (all cheer) Shit. Can we-- does our aim reach? Our ranged attacks, do they reach? Do ranged attacks reach? I can at least try, right? Fail so hard. Get on it, now. (gasps) Oh, good. Oh no! Clean your gun, clean your gun! I am, I'm ready, it's too far! No! Fly down! Get him! Get him! What? Try to grab him! Try to grab him! No, no, no. Can we see this all happening off to the side? Keyleth! You lost our flying carpet, you unconscious bastard! Vax! And I run over to Vax. And I'm like trying to figure out what's wrong with him. Oh no! Oh, good. No, wait-- At the-- Oh, man! Right in the noggin. Can you shoot him again? Yeah. But wait, you can shoot him while he's on the ground! Can't you? He's on the ground? Fudge! What're you gonna do? All of our shit's gone. Maybe we can-- can we walk up and see-- -- if we can find another bridge? Oh, 20! No, no assistance needed. Plus my perception? My perception is six. (gasps) Oh my god. We have infinite rope! I'm gonna tie it to myself-- No-- aww. Oh, all right. (gasps) It's water down there? MARISHA and No you don't. It's 1000 feet down. It's 1000 feet. Do you want to die? You're being incredibly childish. Don't do that. Don't. Dive. 1000 fucking feet. Water? How far down from the bridge? Well, look, we know-- we can't get over there. Oh. The thing is-- The thing is, we know that-- -- deeper down is where they've gone. So probably it'd be best to go down. We could have avoided all of this bullshit if we'd just have known-- Right. Gets pulled under? Wait, but we're gonna have to go down eventually, so. Okay. Well, everybody keeps saying that everything is deeper and deeper, so I think we're gonna have to go-- -- deep down. Eventually. Yeah. It can grab us. Exactly. The tunnel doesn't go that high. Yeah. It can grab us from there. But the tunnel, oh-- (quietly) I think we should go down! Kima! Maybe, okay. If I go down there-- -- and look in one of the tunnels-- -- can I look in one of the tunnels and see if I find tracks? If I do, can we go that way? I've got a flying carpet! There's tunnels that don't have lava flowing into them. Exactly! There is a tunnel that we can walk in. Yes! Please, Scanlan, let me look for tracks. Please? Tracks in a tunnel. It is! Yes. Okay. Okay. Oh. All right, fine! Let's do whatever you guys want to do. Water holes! It's four against us anyway. We gotta go that way. Ugh, no. And Trinket! No, then I can't carry Grog. I think we should go. Going! We're going. We're coming back! Okay, I could, I have, wait! I have a-- I have a lantern. Yeah. Cause I have a dungeoneering kit. Part the water! Part the water! We don't wanna land, we just wanna go towards the tunnel. Can you lower the water, so we can fly-- Fuck all y'all bitches! Let's go in there! Let's go into the tunnel. So I'm stealthing, let's stealth? Let's be very quiet. Can you turn into an animal? Okay, and I stealth. 15. Plus, oh. No, we're like hopping down off the carpet, and I just want to look around for tracks! What! You took our carpet? Oh, we're going-- okay, you guys are joining us. All right. I'm just looking for tracks right now, Tiberius. Oh my god. You motherfucker. 16. Can we see where the tunnel leads? We have the light, remember, when I-- So we can either run or loot. What should we do? Oh, I'm so scared, but okay, here's the thing, I remember another situation very similar to this. And it was the lair of one of those umber hulks. Oh brother, I think we found the lair of the umber hulk Oh, pretty damn sure. Oh, really? Can I go along the walls very stealthily and see if I can find any opening, anything else? Oh God. Oh. Keyleth, I think you should turn into an eagle. Can she turn into something big enough that can carry me? What if you turn into something big enough that it can carry me, I hop on your back and we throw something at it? And then fly away. (all laugh) Fuck. We were talking really quietly. Oh fuck! Oh my God. (all laugh) Oh no. We don't mean to disturb you, great sire. We're not going to! We mean to help you! We mean to find our way out, and find our friend. That's all. Please. Who did this to you? We can help you. We can help you get revenge against your brethren who did this to you. Yes. 19? Should we bring it with us? To leave this cavern? Tiberius? Maybe you can send that fucking carpet back down. (all laugh) Please, join us on the carpet. She can fly. I keep a distance. Not just yet! Hold on tight. Hold on! Hold on! No! No! Peace, friends! We are ourselves! We are not controlled. Ally. Let's destroy your hive. No? Oh! Tinfoil hat! MARISHA and Yes. Oh yeah, can we sense motive on him? Oh gosh. I rolled-- what do we add to it? Insight? 24. (laughs) Four? Clarota... (laughs) Cla-ro-ta? We are very interested in being allies with you. Might we have your word that upon defeating this creature, we will be safe? Ew, ugh! It better be good! Clarota's dancing, I can see it! Oh! K'varn! LAURA and Yeah sorry about that, you guys. Sorry! Oh my gosh. I know! We should get him to make us hats!
