Whoa, that's magic. Wait! Wait, there was a card on the box. Oh! That's not going to happen. See, that's why you read the card before you open the box. Ashley makes awesome candles out of bottles. Really? Are we waiting for the end? Okay. He is in a Broadway play. It's chaos today. (sing) Cross-talk. Oh that's right! I want some stuff. Give me stuff. Ooh, what is that. Let me see, let me see. Vex. He's Vex. Just kidding, I'm Vex (cackles). That's amazing! That's right, we weren't here! Right? We could all grow a beard... technically. We could, why not? Do you guys have a problem if I keep the Pearl of Power? It lets you use another third spell slot, 3rd-level spell. And I figure you guys all have better spells than 3rd-level, but I only have up to 3rd-level. Of my most powerful spell, which is my 3rd-level. And they usually do a lot of damage with the 3rd-level. You got that Ring of Protection. Or you can have the beardy thing. That's pretty high. I think that's our wonderful Matt Mercer's call. Keyleth, I think, would like the ring. You would look really good with a beard. Yes? The only one who didn't is my brother. The circlet with the hat. Oh. Sorry... sorry. I took that pearl and you wanted it, huh? Yeah. Are we done? Are we ready to do things now? Yeah, a super cute mouse! This is true as well. That... doesn't add to... And it looks wonderful on you. Are we standing out on the street divvying up random items? Well I've got a beautiful pearl, so I'm happy. Bust out those dice! What? I'm sorry Percy, are you talking? Arrows! Arrows for me please. Darling? I don't remember. Oh... (whispering) It's super-duper flawless 'cause you put it in the Wheel. Do it. I didn't even think you were in there. Oh! Okay. Without taking too long on it, I was also hoping, while we're in town. That armor that we stole from the big rhinoceros monster in the duergar castle? Yes. The armor that we took from him. Is there any way I can find a blacksmith that can maybe upgrade Trinket's armor with that? Okay. All right. Here we go. Pick wisely. I'm using the new fancy one, so don't fail me. 20? Does she have a beard? (clears throat) Karin, yes? Don't mean to interrupt. You look very busy here. All right. I've heard rumor that you are a very talented blacksmith. I have quite an interesting proposition for you. I may have some material you've never worked with, I don't know. Would you mind stepping outside for a moment? Get some fresh air? Believe me, you'll want to see this. You'll want to see this. Ugh! I don't know which-- that's the problem with having too many. I'm rolling my Trinket die, since it applies to Trinket. That wasn't good. Nine? Yay! Oh. No need for that, darling. Trinket! No, no! Take a gander at his armor. He's friendly, don't worry. Yes. He likes you. I can tell. Yes, it has. I'm hoping to protect him a bit more, however. Yes. You can do better, I'm sure. Actual combat. Beauty? Not my concern. Well. (grunts) A very large one, actually. A bull-- Bulette. That one. It wasn't on the surface. We're a bit of adventurers, if you want to know. You've probably heard of us. Vox Machina? Yeah? That is correct. Nice! Right. Is two days enough? Yes. Understandable. How much is a bit more? And we will send many, many customers your way. Of course. (whispering) Trinket isn't sponsored, it's just fucking us. How about 450? Shit. Because I want to. Wah-wah! That would be 26. (spits) Deal. See you in a few days. Two days. Thank you, Karin! Oh, of course, yeah! Use it together. Trinket. Trinket, look at you naked. So cute. All right, sorry that took so long. No. Yeah, oh my gosh. What? Saran Wrap? Ooh, that's good. Ooh, that's good. Yay, Pike, yay! Yep. Don't do it. Don't do it. Ugh. That's disgusting. And another one, you get advantage, you can do it again. Hey, and you know what? It doesn't smell as bad now. Yeah, thank you. It doesn't even smell bad anymore, so thank you. I'll give it to you. I won't even haggle with you, Percy, I'll just give it to you. I mean, well, you know. You know what I mean. (laughs) I know. Come on, Percy! That's an extra-special arrow. Does it do extra damage? Okay, I'll do that. Come here, you beautiful bastard. And you're wearing the belt that makes you extra persuasive. Was there also a grappling arrow, Percy? Ooh. Can you do that? Please be good. Oh, percentile dice! No, a percentile dice. 100, that's a 100. I think it is, yes. Well, should we go? It's so he can spy on you. Did you get that potion so you can spy on Pike when she's naked? Yeah, yeah. Yes. Yes, you have. Yes. Good, I do. Oh, that's so cute! You really, really want Trinket to be a girl. Oh, I see. Understandable. Boy. And maybe he could roll into things now! It'll be awesome. Trinket is a special bear. He weighs a lot. He weighs more than Grog. (gasps) Fastball special Trinket. That puts him at 20. Awesome. So if I did try to roll him into something it wouldn't hurt him-- -- because that would technically be bludgeoning. Okay. Let's go see the Council. She looks really pretty today, Tiberius. I think they're just friends, darling. Oh, she's a late sleeper, I like it. I shake his shoulders. Look at you! I'm sorry, I was writing down your name, Desona, what? Desona. Hello. Oh, yes. Are we taking a skyship? Lady Kima! You look wonderful, Lady Kima. Oh. No no no, Grog Grog Grog. No. Mage Hand? We're putting it in the box, yeah? Yeah, it's pretty horrible. Yes. Back in the Bag of Holding? The box? Plus adding extra runes in there might jack up the enchantment they already put in the box. I'm excited! Probably best not to bring it there, yeah. Yeah, yeah. (laughs) Which is cool. And wood and magic. Me? I believe so. I mean, we did a few insight type things last time, but I mean, we can do some more. I think we should definitely talk up the new guards and see what kind of people they are when we're on our way to the ship, how about that? Or Scanlan on one. I'll take the guy. This is crazy! Awesome! Captain Damon? Just making sure I got your name. Keyleth, it's really windy! Don't worry, Captain Damon, they're-- A week. Yes. Are you going to take a selfie? Are we taking selfies? Selfie staffs, though. Oh, that's a good one, that's a really good one. Oh, ropes. Wait, how did Trinket get up if we had to climb ropes? Winches. You're okay, darling! Yeah. All right, all right. Yes. Where's the box, where's the box. Are we keeping an eye on the box? I want to stay on top, but I feel like I should go to keep an eye on the box and see and make sure. Oh, wow. Oh, go get food. Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods; she preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages. [dramatic music] Why would we agree to it? I think it's on. It's special. Nope, none for you, darling. Oh yeah! Well, you guys can shrink him, you have Polymorph. I like it. Thank you! I'm getting so many things added to my inventory during this game. This is exciting. I got arrows, I got scrolls. I have a question about Trinket's new armor. It has an area for me to ride on him still, right? Like the other armor? I forgot to mention it to her. But the last one had a divot thing so I could fit. You're so helpful, brother. I thought you were into Gilmore, darling. (laughs) Well, I mean, I can use my personal but we have very little party funds. All right, I'm taking 400 gold out of my personal. I'm spending most of the time up near Captain Damon, watching him work. Can we use any kind of perception to see if the things on them are controlling them? I get plus two for any dragon-y things. 19. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Oh my God look at the ship! Look at the crystals! It looks like the crystals are really 3D in the picture. That's amazing! No. Oh my gosh. Whoa. 22. 20. (laughs) He heard you. What did you get? That's true! Okay! I'm going to do-- they're all far away from each other, aren't they? Jeez Louise. I am going to Hunter's Mark one of the ones with the rider on them. Oh, all of them? Even the one with feathers? I'll go for the feathered one, then. Hunter's Mark! Hunter's ring. And I'm going to Hail of Thorns him at a level three. Yeah? It just says a ranged weapon. That is a really good question. I'm going to run forward. That looks about right. Yeah. That means I can duck against one of those walls where the stairs is, right? Okay, cool. So a regular attack. 17. Yes! Okay, so regular attack and then also thorn attack, right? And three. 23 plus my regular 14. Yeah, so that should get him and the rider on the Hail of Thorns part. Oh! Hunter's Mark! I said it. Three additional damage for Hunter's Mark on that. Oh, shit! Awesome. Let's do it. That is a 24. Okay. Yes. Ten. I love it! Oh, I didn't move Trinket at all. I want him to be near me. Yeah, but blocking on the wall. Yeah. Warn me first! Oh no. As a reaction, can we fricking tie ourselves down to the boat? I do, I have the rope of-- Shit. Trinket. Or be free? And be free. Oh, I get it. Okay. Natural 20. That was the guard. You could run to the side and tie yourself to-- And there's pegs to tie yourself to on the sides. Six hit points? That's awesome! Where did the music go? (laughs) There it was. It happened in like second-second-second-second. I don't think-- I remember you had to be damaged, right? That's amazing. Everything's falling. Oh no, it's that jerk. No! Fudge. All right. At me still? Oh, all right. Okay, so my armor class is 19 but I'm wearing a plus two Ring of Protection. Is that with the plus two ring? So it hits me then. So I have to beat 15? (exaggerated pain noises) (laughs) Yeah. Holy fudge, dude! 26! I've got to start doing math now. He's got 20. Oh no! Okay okay okay... okay... Trying to shoot the wing. I didn't realize we could save him. Deal with it. Stop it! Hits the railing. Breaks his back. She's going down. Yeah! (laughs) Show him. But you can move. Oh no. Oh wow. (whispers) Guiding Bolt the griffon. That's me! Okay. I didn't have one! Thanks, Pike! I can't wait. I'll wait and do it. That's okay. That's okay! Okay! You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to use a Superior Healing Potion, which is how many-- what do I roll for that? Whoa. Uh-huh, actually very severely. I'm going to add those up in just a second. That's a lot of adding. Okay, but first I'm going to-- he's on the ground, so if I step away from him he doesn't get a-- Okay, so I'm going to move away from that guy. I'm going to-- Actually, I'm not going to move-- I'm going to move against the railing around Grog. Can I do that? Yeah, and I'm going to stand next to Grog and hope he overshadows me. And I'm going to Lightning Arrow the griffon. Why do I feel like a griffon will be immune to lightning attack? They're fine, right? That is 4d8. Oh, I have to roll to see if I hit. Okay, which one looks like a Lightning Arrow? This, the amethyst, looks like a lightning one. Okay, that's good, that's 25? Okay, so now it's 4d8. 15. For my second attack, I'm going to have Trinket charge the elf girl in red. Or no, he's going to attack the wyvern that's on the ground, that makes more sense. Doesn't it? And bash him with his new armor, and you know do stuff. (laughter) Okay. I don't know if I've ever attacked with Trinket. It's been a really long time. And he rolled a one. With inspiration-- no, it's a one. It's a frickin' one. Oh shit, I forgot I was poisoned. I forgot I was poisoned! Shit. Oh, I'm going to finish the healing potion just for now. Would you mind healing him? He's low on health. Look, Keyleth, it's what you wanted. You can rip off his whole wing? Rip all the griffon's feathers off. Oh. Yeah, it's gone. That's okay, you still flung him real hard. No, you already did it. What? These things are hard. That could be cool too. Around you. Oh no! Twinsie! He's up now, yeah. Roll well. He hasn't hit the water yet? Whoa. Take a healing potion! Wait, which way? Oh, we all shift, so okay, we're already against the railing. Oh no. Can we all Star Trek it? Oh yeah, you've got to grip. That's true, but I don't need it. That's a 29 for me. Hey. No, not Damon! Damon, no! Oh no. Everything's falling. Oh my gosh. Come on, Pike. All of those dice are bad. You need all-new dice. Three. Don't roll that. Roll one of these. Oh, so I can't attack? If I get up and out. Okay. I'm going to like brace my foot on Grog's shoulder and climb up. Awesome. Can I shoot my grappling arrow at this bastard here at the end of the ship? Is that far enough? Is that close enough? All right, I want to shoot it at the rider, I want to shoot the grappling arrow at the rider. And I'll catch him and bring him in. Oh, cast Hunter's Mark on him first, though. Yeah, that fucking, yeah. Yeah, it's on it, yay. Oh god, okay. So nervous. Yes. 26. Okay. So how do I do it? Okay. Plus my regular? 13. Plus six for the Hunter's Mark. One. And then I've got him grappled? Yeah, for my second action I want to pull him off. Okay. Oh, well, okay. 16. Should I use my inspiration? Yeah? Okay, so that's 23. Yes! I'm still holding the rope-- holding on. That's my whole action, right? That's everything I can do? Okay. Yeah, go NPC! Next to a tiny rabbit swimming around. And the Hunter's Mark is on the little halfling thing, not the wyvern, just so you know. Oh no, our music went away again. Oh, that's cool! Slow jams for Scanlan in the boudoir. A little halfling dude. You're in New Jersey. Do something to that big wyvern. Get rid of him. All we've got are two little bandits after that. I have no idea what's happening anymore. Oh man. Yeah, I think we don't attack the last dude, just kill the wyvern. And one little halfling that I've got a rope on. Seriously? Yes. Yeah. Kill all the things. Ooh, it's a little chilly. I pull the arrow so it wraps up in the rope. I thought it was cracked or something. We need to check on that box. Now. He's in New Jersey. Do you have a beard today? He definitely has a beard today. Insight check? 20. Captain Damon, what do you propose we do with this thief-pirate? Grog! It was a girl, it was a poor little girl halfling. Oh wait, I still have the grapple arrow. No, I'm still holding on still, so she's dangling? Can I catch her? Yeah. But it was wrapped around her, so maybe it didn't hurt quite as bad. I pull her up. I look at Grog. Really? Really? I pull her up. Oh shit, maybe we should've let her drop. No, no. No. What, should we put her in a prison cell? I don't know what to do with her now that we have her. What do you think, little one? You want a real job, maybe brush your teeth? Anything. Be afraid of him. Be very afraid. Pike, do you want to heal her? That's true. Teera. Her breath is really really bad, maybe you can heal her teeth while you're at it. You can earn your wage on this ship, if you behave. Yeah. Lady Kima? This fricking gnat in this fricking room. It feels like little fishes, doesn't it? Is she healed? Did you heal her? Wow. That's so cool! He's definitely trying to kill us.
