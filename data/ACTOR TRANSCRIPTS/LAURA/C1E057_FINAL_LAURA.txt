Oh, is that what this one was from? Yeah, Skeletor! We are? (gasps) That's exciting! (laughing) Yeah. Yeah! Top three. Yes. (similar accent) Critter, it's a Critter shirt. What's Boaty McBoatface? But it was like a joke for publicity, right? And he did it That's awesome! Concert. Can we talk about our next thing because I'm so excited about it. YES. Wait, okay, so Liam gets to say it. Battle Chasers. Okay, okay, okay. (noises of awe) It's blocking my face, but I want to see it. 3 weeks. Forever! So yeah, keep in mind when you order it on pre-order that you have to wait for it to be fully pre-ordered before we can send it out. I don't know if that was on camera because I'm above the poster. (laughter) That's right. Oh no, don't take it away. Yeah, they're that full-on-- It's beautiful. Oh, man! Batman the Telltale series! Yeah. It's pretty exciting. And at E3 today, we went and checked out the demo and it's pretty frickin' cool. What time is it? (laughs) Let's go. My only errand is to keep my eyes on you. Don't let him shop, Percy. Do not let him shop. (laughs) That eagle form really made a difference. Where is this Raven Queen's temple? Do you need to check in at your temple, or should we pretend you're not here so they don't try to make you stay? Let's do it. Can I grab one of the people that are here and ask him, What's all the hustle about outside? I see them installing more. Smart. Nobody's sighted the dragons, though, over here? I'm sorry, what was the question? Oh no. Loran. Loran was his name. Slayer's Take. Pointy chin. Got it. Keyleth is proud of herself because we've just killed our third, actually. Liam, I don't want to ask Matt this, but the chick that runs the Slayer's Take, her name's Vanessa? Are Vanessa and Merkin around? Mertin. Should we try to sell Vanessa some of our dragon bits? Well, they tend to be in the-- I know, right? What was I thinking? Of course. Grog, come with me. Can I go find Vanessa? (sing-song) Vanessa? Vox Machina here-- oh, hi. Oh, well, we were wondering if we could be of service to you. We happen to have acquired a great many dragon bits and we thought you might be in need of buying them for your sellers-- buyers. Your people. Fence-- you know. No fencing, no. No, you're-- Legal buyers. Black. Ancient black dragon. Oh, white! Do we have any white bits left? What, do you want scales or... That was the dragon we killed for you before, because we didn't bring the-- No, but we killed one with Zahra. We killed a white dragon. We've killed four dragons?! Four fucking dragons. Go us. Yes, I think so. Of white dragon scales. 5,000 gold pieces, I think is a fair price. What if we gave you less dragon scales? Would you have said less money? I think we'll keep them and we'll sell them to other vendors, then. Vanessa, you're so kind. I'm so sorry. Thank you, Vanessa. They were worth a lot more than what she was offering, just for the record. They are worth so much more. Well, we've not really tried. That doesn't mean we should just give them away. It's not 64 pounds. Oh, it was 64 pounds. (groans) Well, they're worth like 20,000 gold. You don't care. All right. Let's go find your queen. What do you have in there? Are they still good? We could make stink-bombs with it. MARISHA AND We go see the Raven Queen. You go see the Raven Queen and we wait outside. Uselessly. That's what he's doing, Grog. (laughs) She's ornery today. We are. Oh, don't shake him too hard-- I'm not there. So much. Trinket's out. Come on, Trinket. He doesn't mind it. I know you don't want me to come. I know. And I won't, if you're sure. I put you in this place and I feel terrible about it and I know you're extremely nervous. Trinket can sense it, too. He's very in tune with those emotions. And I just-- Everything will be fine! (laughs) I wanted it unbuttoned, actually. Yes. I know. Everything's fine. You don't need to be nervous, either. I will be here waiting for you when you come out. I love you. I'm proud of you, you know. She's just going to love you so much. And who knows, you might have a new girlfriend when you come out. (laughs nervously, sighs) I've heard other people have dated gods before. I've heard it's done. That Cashew guy. Anyway. I'll be right here. Keep him safe. I know. All right. It'll be fine. I'll just be right here. Waiting here with Trinket. Just calmly leaning against a wall. No big deal. I don't even think she's that bad. She's not going to be bad. Just go. Oh gosh, oh jeez. (whispers) I'm not there. I jump up immediately. I've bitten off all my fingernails. Is that blood? Is that blood all over you? Did she hurt you? I get out a rag and I start wiping everything off. (laughs) You're alive, though. (laughing) Oh my god, are you stronger now? Are you so strong? Oh, I don't believe it. (laughs) Do you want to ride Trinket for a while? Yes! No, he loves the taste of blood. (laughs) Oh, Trinket. He's very light. Scrawny, scrawny, scrawny. (laughs) Aren't you glad you got out of the Pokeball for this? So everything's good, then. He's good? Everything's fine? He talked to her? Were you there? Oh. Well, I'll find out. Well, good. He has a purpose. I keep him steady and I walk next to him. You've got-- You've also got a five-pound bag of gems, don't forget. You want another beret? Little food bits fall out. Oh my god. (gasps) It's basically like a unicorn? Wow. Whoa. Grog, you're so monstrous. (clapping) Go, Pike! Go, Pike! Go, Pike! No! Oh no! He's gone insane. So many, Grog. Yeah. It was a giant battle. Like at least this many. That's more than six. Can I heat water up in the fireplace? Ten! Ten! Ten! Whoa. Oh, that's nice. (laughs) Ohhh. (laughs sarcastically) (gasps) I've been slowly heating water and giving it to Vax to put in his bath. I don't wash him! I just give him the fucking water. Do I see any of the blood? Passive perception? 32. I also spend a lot of time that night reading, but I'm reading the book about the Raven Queen. Pretty much have it memorized at this point. Oh, there's a Loot Crate giveaway. It's so sick. Also, give your friend a hug. Love each other. Don't tease me about the Feywild. Is one of the Vestiges there? Which one? It's a cloak that devours magic? And there's a really beautiful strong bow in the Feywild. Yeah, to the Dread Emperor's. You can banish us to the Dread Emperor's island? To the Feywild? So we don't even have to find an entrance? Is it somewhere that you have to have been, or can it be somewhere that we have been. Syngorn is in the Feywild. They transferred the entire city there. It's a whole other plane. Would we have learned something about it in Syngorn? It sounds awful. No, it says it's offline. Okay. Yay! And we got the warden thing. Yeah, that was the best. You know, because the more I think about it, I mean, we almost just died many times and the last time we tried to get a Vestige it almost killed us, and maybe we just need a little bit more preparation, maybe? Make sure Whitestone is actually preparing something underground just like Westruun. Exactly, but there's a spinning orb of death there. Oh, okay. Bless you. Are they like mermaids? (gasps) In your roving pirate days. Wait, could I see the list of Vestiges? Whisper? (sing-song) The Shrew? Have you heard about an island of glass? Yeah? Near an island of glass? (laughs) I was waiting for it to-- Come around, yep. It's a good plan, Grog. You could really do something terrible to him with that thing. I think you're probably right. But let's make sure that Whitestone is safe before we do such a thing. We don't need an airship. We have an instant ability to transport anywhere. That will be the first thing we do when Thordak dies is we jump on an airship. All the fun has gone out of it. We're going to Whitestone. (laughs) You're stuck in the tree? Are there any leaves on the Sun Tree yet? Whatever. A wolf. I just want to go find Zahra and give her a hug and say hello and see how she's doing while he's talking. Dear, the dragon arrow you gave me? Killed him. Well, I didn't kill him, actually, with it, but I did a lot of damage. Umbrasyl. Dead. One down. Where's Cashew? I know his name is fucking Kashaw. So he's not there. I do know broody types. What are you reading? I'm sure you have ideas. I sit down next to her and ask, just catching up, and see if they've spotted any dragons. Zahra, how long did it take you to make that arrow? If I were to give you some more money, do you think you could do it again? I'll talk to Percy, but I'm sure, if it's for a good cause... All right. I'll come find you, dear. That's his first name? Shaun? How did you know that? I fucking know, I remember. We taking a trip? Yeah. (laughs) ASHLEY AND You look so healthy, Gilmore! Oh? That we are. Oh. (giggles) You're strong enough to-- be careful of your wound, Gilmore! The orb. They get sucked in, Grog. We have some delicious and very expensive wine. Expensive-ass wine we could bust out with dinner. Oh, I haven't got to wink in a really long time, you guys. It felt so good. Definitely, dear. (laughs) While we're getting ready, I would like to talk to Pike about a certain proposal that happened. None of us have addressed it. What happened? What did you tell him? Did you tell him yes, did you tell him no? We'll circle back? (laughing) How did he take that? How do you feel about him, Pike? He is very charming. Even more charming! Like, every once in a while I look at him and I go No, but he's small, but at the same time, I'm kind of interested. You feel like-- yeah! But if you're actually interested, then it's not gross at all. Wait. We don't want to push you, Pike, but you know, it's just us girls here. All right. You pray to your Sarenrae about it. You look beautiful. I tug up my dress. Of course! Can you breathe? All right. Aw, Matt. I give her a hug. How's Kima? We haven't seen her yet. You don't have to wear a dress, Kima. (chuckles) Would it be in this plane or another? You haven't put any blood through it, though? No, I'm hoping that hasn't happened. Was it sucking you in? Gilmore-- any of you, Allura-- have you experienced any kind of draw toward the orb? Do you feel different, having been around it for very long? Well, I don't know. I mean, it is a very strong relic that we don't know how it works. Up close and personal. Don't dragons sort of see past those things? We-who-must-not-be-named. (gasps) I love it. Yes! Yes, the Warden. The Wrath of the Fey Warden. Just the name. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Out of the cancerous tree. And Fen-wraths? What's the name? Fenthras is inside of the tree that is terrible. Did you happen to find in your research what, perhaps, we might face in the Feywild? I mean, we've learned a little bit of it, but I know that it's going to be rather dangerous. (laughs) (laughs) Oh. Yes. Good thing we didn't provoke them in the cave at all, Percival. Yeah, why am I writing this down? I know this shit. (whispering) Interesting. (muffled) Oh, fuck. (gasps) You think there's something bigger than Thordak in the Fire Plane? Could he still potentially have it inside of him? All right. Which one? Oh, Kord. I got it. (chuckles) Oh, fuck. Because he's a dick. I'm confused. Take over everything. Well, that's good. Maybe they won't take vengeance. Maybe the white one will want to help kill Thordak with us. No. Does the heart-stone make him even stronger than he already was? Shit. If we can pry it out of his body, we could shrink him down. Perfect plan. We can go in another dragon. Doing what, just flying? Wow. So good. This wine is pretty good. You've done so much. You should have been with us. Sorry, Kima. We're dicks. It's... better. It's getting better. Oh, yes. We will. (laughs) We could go get me a new bow. There's also the ocean. No! You're crazy. Or the two of you together. "Birkenstalks?" I like it. I want to make a once-over on Vax and make sure that-- So you did, you got all the blood off, then? I mean, we got all cleaned up for tonight. I just want to make sure you didn't ruin it by keeping some of the blood in your freaking hair. Nothing! Just making sure you're doing all right. All the blood's gone. You're great. Good. Fuck, no, not ready, but we can do it. I walk over to Percy. Before you leave, I whisper in your ear, "You still have a little blood behind your ear." (sighs) Sure. Are you going to tell me why you went and saw the Raven Queen? (whispering) Dear-- We all need sleep sometimes, hon. Is this for you, or for my brother? I give Percy a kiss on the cheek. It's exciting. (laughs) I think it suits you. I won't tell anyone, Percy. Your business is yours. And mine, because I noticed. (chuckles) (quietly) We're all family. Oh! Percy! Sorry. If Zahra wanted to make some dragon arrows, could she use stuff here in the castle? Yes. All right. Sachet. What does it do? Are you still here? You should go to bed. In the dining hall? What? I know. Always. (chuckles) I'm very perceptive. I love you so much. All right. I don't know what you are talking about. Ohhh. I walk by him as he's doing this and say, You know he can't read, right? (gasps) I knew it. I knew it. The rakshasa? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Why does it always leave off when he's about to get killed? Because you do. That's the thing. (laugh) Oh, so what did you do? What did you do? And you said something shitty to him. Oh, nice! Was he? Did you chop him up? Nice, Matt. Thanks, guys. That can be the name of the episode Yas Queen. (laughter) Are we doing another giveaway? Thanks, Loot Crate! Thanks, Joe! Thanks, Critters, for being awesome!
