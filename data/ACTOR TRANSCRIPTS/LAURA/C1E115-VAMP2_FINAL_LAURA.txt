We already know where you are. The hood is pointless. We're all going to have lisps tonight, you guys. Because you have really big fangs. Yeah, I'm from Portal! I'm Chell. It really is a Pip Boy! It's so cool! And what is Travis from? You're Kirby? Oh. Yeah, good call. Yes I will! How is that at all having to do with-- Okay, I'm really-- it's hard to tell if these cameras are on us, but I think that they are. I have two things to tell you about tonight. This is good for the holidays. These are Strongjaw Ale coasters! For your personal Strongjaw bar at home! Look at these fucking-- and they're like, rubbery. They're cool as fuck. Like our shirts, man! With our Critical Role logo! It's pretty tight! In addition to those wonderful stocking stuffers, I have, okay, so these have been in the works for a very freaking long time. Finally, we can announce them! With teeth in our mouth. Okay, okay! So, it's a set of d20s, but they're all inspired by our characters. We designed all of our dice ourselves. And it comes in this Vox Machina logo bag, but it looks like it's from Gilmore's Glorious Goods! I have never sounded nerdier in my entire life, and I love it. Sam, yours is a total troll dice. You specifically asked for-- Yeah. You were like, "I want people to not be able to read it." So his is sparkly with purple on pink. It's really hard to read. Mine is really beautiful because it's inspired by my white dragon armor. Yeah, and the 20s have our little icon on the 20! And he's got the de Rolo family crest. I know, what a loser. There's the segue! Online, right now! They're in the store right now! I know, in the store! Right now! Yeah, this is coming out this week, and then we've got more merch coming out for the holidays. So you know, keep your eye on the shop. You don't have to, I'll be announcing it. You don't have to. Yeah, I have enough for all of us to take. You are so fancy! I don't even have a Portal gun, and he's got two guns! What? Really? It might work? It's hot in here, so my cake is melting. Yeah, we can totally eat it at the break! So we're playing as our characters, playing a game. So all we have to do is outsmart Grog? You're like, Fallout Glamor. Yeah, I've got some really good songs, but I don't have all my songs. Yeah, it's fine. I've got plenty of time. Yes, at Supanova, come see! I found it! Just a little hungry. You're sup-- oh, oh! Maybe, you guys, should I sneak ahead? Should I obfuscate ahead? Obfuscate? No. You just took one out? Does that mean he's like, an old vampire? Like, he's been a vampire a really long time? It was so good. Yeah. We don't know that they're all dead, we just know the Twitch studio has exploded. For all we know, the rest of Legendary is still there. Fuck, no. I have to remember, yeah I have to remember what is-- No, don't throw things! Do we hear any sounds coming from the tunnel? No, our only choice is to travel underground. I want to. We can see. I think that's a really good idea, Liam. You should stay here and be safe. Do it, go so fast. Or I could sneak down because people can't see me if I do it well. Okay, I'm going to do that. He's not going to go fast, I'm going to sneak in. I'll go caw caw. The red? Two. I get hungrier, but I can do it. Okay. Okay. I got hungrier, so I've got to put my fangs back in you guys. Does it feel stable? What does it smell like? Oh! So I can see! I'm going to lick the algae. Just, like, a little lick. Not like a big, big lick. Hmm. Not like rat droppings? I know. I am. Shut up! I keep going forward. It keeps going? Oh. Okay, wait. I go back to them. Follow behind me, but not right behind me. Just, you know, whatever. Like 50 feet behind me. Is that far? Yeah! And then unless I make noise like a scream or something then you know it's safe, you can keep coming forward. Yeah, I'm so tough. Yep. And I go back to where I was and keep walking. Holy shit, it's like catacombs. Is this serious? This is serious. Yeah? You are really creepy looking. I can choose? Okay guys! It intersects with the sewer. There's got to be so many rats in the sewer. Here's the thing. Y'all, rats are super good. They're like so fucking good. Sofa king delicious. But here's the thing. This tunnel intersects with the sewer. We can either continue through this tunnel and try to figure out, I don't know, why we're vampires and see if there's some source to this power or we go to the sewer and we live. Yeah. We can hide out in the sewers under LA. Look, wait, we're fucked. We're vampires. There's probably other things that are scary. True. Technically I did too, but it's not important. It's just a chick. It's just this chick, up in the Smart Girls. No I didn't know her, remember we were there fucking together? Look, Travis, not all of us have willpower like you. I get really hungry and if I don't eat, I get really angry. Here's the thing, we could record at night. After a few days with these teeth, I think I'll get used to talking with them. I know but I don't do very many of them. Really? You think so? Thanks. About what? I mean we can go, we can keep looking. We might die. That's true. You can't swim at the beach and stuff. You know, in one of the games I did where I was a vampire, vampires are allergic to water. Yeah. I don't know if that's true or not. Oh, is there water in the sewer? I'm going to wind over and put my hand in it and let-- Did it hurt though? Okay, then I don't think we're allergic to water. So what do you think? Do you want to go to the tunnels some more? You want to stay a vampire? Aw, you didn't feel anything. Should we go to the path? But don't forget, this is where the tunnel continues on from where Geek and Sundry was. Okay. Gross. Can I try to get a rat? Because I'm really good at it now. I rolled two successes. Yay! Can I try to catch one for Travis? Is it Dex brawl again? Whoa! Critical success! Oh, but I got a one on one of my red. I can make rat hamburgers. I'm less hungry, I can take my teeth out. Never mind, they won't come out. I'm stuck like this. Let's go to the sanctuary. I will! Oh shit. Two successes, one fail. Really? That's really far. Well, but, no-- oh, that's a five. I look up. Yeah. Forward or back? What is it? A lizard? Like a person lizard? (gasping) Oh my god, what is it? Can we eat it? Oh. Oh shit. Stay back Liam, it's too dangerous. How long have you been here? They're the lizard people of Los Angeles! How can we not be vampires anymore? Ish. We don't know anything. Yeah, but what about this? Just kidding! Yeah. Can you help us? Are they going to kill us? "I don't know. Yes, like me. We'll see." Yeah. Let's do it. Before we release you, pinky swear that you're going to help us. Can I try to manipulate him or persuade him or something? I'm not as good at it as Vex is. Stamina! Three successes. You seem really familiar. Yeah! Do you ever go to Jinky's? I feel like we know him; let's release him for sure. I know! Can we cut that cake? Oh yeah! I was thinking of the restaurant. We love that place. It's so good. What?! That's creepy! Damn, this is big! Which direction did we enter from? Jeez Louise. That's big and intricate. What is his name? Lock. What is Lock doing right now? This is still underground? Are you going to come in with us? Is it scary? Because he's big and strong! So Travis goes first, then? But you know what? Mine is four as well. Liam, you stay back. You have to be safe. Does it look like it was all done at the same time, or has it been added over time? So it's like a surgical theater. Oh, that's good. You got a critical success. He got two tens on blood dice. Things are kind of crazy out there. Aww, you got us. Three weeks? There was a giant meatball that seemed to be turning people into other things. Oh yeah. There was a guy that we know that when we woke up all of a sudden he was a wizard and he had electricity coming off of him. Do you play D&D? Hey, I have some merch we were going to sell in my pocket. Do you want coasters? I've got some Strongjaw coasters. Sort of, like the scales are less vibrant. Here's the thing. We just want to know what's going on with us. We just want to know what's going on. We don't know anything. Is there something we can do to help you that will, you know, we help you, you help us, help us figure out what's happening. Yeah, I'm really good at rat catching. I'm sneaky. Any other animals that you don't care about? That's good. A boon! We can do that. I mean, we're really nice. Pretty genuine-- No, it'll kill us. I saw what happened to Matt. How long have you been a lizard person, Lock? Have you always been a lizard person? Are you thousands of years old? Cool. Just wondering. I mean, we might not change back you guys. Let's go. It's one of those. Oh, cute. Marlo? Creepy. Ooh, very much like The Descent. Cool. I'm excited to get up top. Or that. I feel like Marisha-ed is worse. It's really high though, baby. Baby, did you fly? Holy--! We haven't tried it. Mahlo, are we supposed to crawl through that tunnel? He's nodding! You could try to jump. I'm going to drop the dice down to Mahlo as I'm climbing. I keep climbing. See, you're so cool. I'm already up and behind. I'm second. It's really bad. Maybe get a different one. Can I see a door? Is there a door? Is there anything cool in this room? Are there buttons? I open the gate. Is it possible an entire day passed while we were down there? Because it's still real super dark. It's just regular humans, nobody seems scared? They're not running around, it's not scary? I'm suddenly super uncomfortable with it. Ugh, stinky meal. But no successes! It's going to be so stinky! He's taking a while. Eww. I feel like there are more subtle ways to get blood. You're going to kill him. It's different when you're surrounded by crazy things, but now that we're out in the normal-- You can't shove a whole body into the--! But what if the poo is stacked really high? Gross. Okay. Anyone we recognize? Four successes. Oh my god, wait! I know those guys! No, but I have a feeling. I feel like Mike is just crazy enough that he'd be down for this. I'm going to go talk to Mike for a second. Hey, okay, let's go. Hi, Mike. What's up? I know it's been a while. No, totally fine, you know, there's a bunch of stuff going on. Have you seen what's happening over at Geek & Sundry? I totally understand. Hey. I have a quick question for you. We're doing a vampire shoot. Yeah, it's pretty tight. Ti-ti-tight. You want to say hi to Travis? He's over here. I know you're busy, but dude. I really think you want to see him. One, two. Just two successes, but no-- well, yeah. No ones at all. Yeah! I mean, I really think you'll be interested in this. So we're going to make small talk on the way back over, like, I was wondering if you had any Pickleback stuff, because I have been craving-- It's a whiskey shot with pickle juice as a chaser. I'm so sorry, I didn't-- We meet up with Travis. Hey, Travis, look! Our shoot is right around the corner here! And we take him around the side of the crypt. But don't kill him! No, here's the thing! No! Mike's cool with it! Look, Mike, I have a proposition for you. Have you ever met a vampire? Have they ever sucked your blood? Would you be willing to go for that again? No, you get to be sucked. That happens post-bite. Yeah, that's how they did in Interview, too. Be nice about it! What are you doing?! He said he was cool with it! No, you're going to kill Mike?! I rolled three successes. Do I see it happening? I'm going to try and stop him. I love you! (sobbing) No! Wits plus brawl? Where's wits? It's six. Did you get a ten? I got a four. I want to jump on Travis' back before he kills him. Travis, don't kill Mike! Don't kill him, he's human! No, no, Travis! Don't kill him! He's fine with it! He said he was fine with it! No, I just don't want him to die! He knows we're vampires, it's fine! No, seriously! I know you're saying okay, I know you do that! And then you're going to snap his neck! No, he totally would know. It's really hard to do, I know. No, just wake him up! He's fine! You want to bite Manzi? See, you're fine. We can't get rid of the last one without killing something. Don't worry about it. Thank you. Just wake him up and tell him he's going to be a vampire soon. Mike, Mike! How are you? Mike, you fell over! You passed out! You said you wanted us to! That's how you turn into a vampire. So be ready. You're probably going to turn in the next few days. Yeah, they've been looking for you, I think. Have a fun shoot! It's like I said, when we were in the offices, everything was weird, and it seemed okay, and now that we're out there's humans around! Oh, that's creepy. You have poop on you. I can smell poop on you. God, I'm so sorry you had to witness all of this. And we have coasters. It was so good. Wow! Did you feel better? Let's do this. No, Mike Diva's alive. I hope we make it out of LA before people find his body. The cleaners. The porta potty cleaners. Do I have cake in my teeth? Is he a vampire? You can't tell? It's a club where vampires are! The globes? Oh, that would have been so smart! I smile at him. I'm trying to make you smile back at me. Did he smile at us? Damn it. I don't think we're trying to get drunk, Sam. It's like a Blade club where they bring humans in and then when the music hits, then everybody gets bit? I start dancing. We have no money. No, they took all of our stuff. Maybe, check and see if the bartender is a vampire. I'm gonna dance too. I'm definitely dancing too. The alcohol! Can you imagine if somebody walked up to the bartender doing this shit? He'd be like, get the fuck out. It's gonna taste like shit. Sam and I have started line dancing. I walk over to Sam and be like You just don't. Trust me. Just don't. Me too? I could sneak past him! Oh, our friends. Yeah, that's good. Why? I'm going to go over against the wall in the dark and Obfuscate. You can't even see me. Can I try to go? And do I need to roll to Obfuscate? I roll my hunger roll? Three. Hunger roll, wits and stealth. Like you do! Two successes. Is that on your health? What is this health and humanity stuff that we haven't even looked at yet? We can all go up. The bouncer's gone. Let's go! Can I come down the stairs from above and be like, what are you guys doing down here? These guys are with me. Two successes, one blood fail. Well yeah, but those don't count. It's only blood fails that count. Hold it. Maybe it will coagulate or scab over. Better than one. Stop sucking on my husband's finger! Did you see us go up? I come back down. He's the last one, I swear. Come on. In Interview with a Vampire, it's bad to feed on other vampires. Right? It's bad to feed on other vampires. But in the book series I read, vampires fed on other vampires and it was totally chill. Does it feel like Blade? Like, are people dressed super-cool? Are there any tables in the corner? Anywhere where it looks like important people would be sitting? Hey! Satine, can you help us? Well, do you know what happened there? Do you know what happened up at the studio? It's fucking crazy. It went crazy. Like, the server room is a giant meatball. Everybody's-- Like, nobody told us what was going on. We just woke up in coffins. Is he like us? We were buried with no money. Does that matter? Is this like a mushroom-- (singing) Maybe we can get rid of some of this hunger. Help us. Something red. Drink it up! Homies. True vampires! Just kidding, baby. If it had been somebody we didn't know. It's just because it was Mike! California king! Comfy. Do we get rid of one of our blood dice from this lager? (squealing) I run over and start dancing with Erika. Are you a vampire? Oh my god! How long have you been a vampire? Really? Oh, that would make so much sense. Erika? Where are the people that run this place? Where are the people that run this place? How do we find them? How do we know what's going on? It's great. This is a lot for me. Celebrities? Okay. Should we be nervous? Oh my god, this makes so much sense! Like, he's a ninja, for real. What's up, man? We didn't set it off, it went off around us. No, I don't think it was Matt that did it. I think-- Yeah. They said that people go down in their tunnels. They're super pissed. No, it was the head of the lizard guys. So Gygax said he wanted to play with Matt Mercer, but then Mercer got killed by the sun and so-- So how long does it take to actually turn? Nobody walked us through it! Is that bad? I didn't mind. I mean, the only person that I killed got burned up in the fire when everything-- so it wasn't like we left any evidence, you know? Yeah. Nowhere in public. Are you adopting us? Oh no! Yeah, we can get sorted! Give us a family! How do we get a sponsor? I'm going to look for my big-- this vein and I'm going to stick it in there. Almost a lizard person. How much blood do you need? I filled the cup up, like, halfway. Brawl? Why fight when you got up and gave a speech? Is somebody about to fight you? Oh. Kotori. That was the name. Yeah, that was the name of the leader. Did he die? Sam! You shouldn't have tried to hit on that girl after she told you no. One critical success. Oh man. Should we talk or is it best to-- I give a big hug back. Please don't stab me in the back. I knew it. Why is he stabbing me?! Wil! Titansgrave! N-n-n-n-n-nineteen! Oh damn! Two successes. One point of-- Is that marked off on the health? Okay. Why? I thought we were buds! She's going to kill you. I thought Wil was my friend! I got it because I didn't say anything. Yeah, your speech was very poor. (laughs) It was so bad it scared me out of talking. What about Travis? Did nobody stab Travis? On the Grand Poobah. I saved your life! I'm just slashed across the back still? I read a lot of vampire novels, I've watched a lot of movies. I played a vampire in Skyrim, and in Bloodrayne. Here's the thing. Nobody told us we weren't supposed to do that. I didn't know. It was fight or flight at that point and as soon we got out to the real world and we were around actual humans and I realised it wasn't the apocalypse-- I kept him from killing somebody! Oh, babe. That's really sweet. No, I'm not okay with that. Can I help him? Can I aid him? What do I do? Okay. I have a critical success. I have two tens, and two more successes outside of that. So four successes, two of them are critical. Mary, which one? Travis or-- You're taking me? You're going to adopt me? Oh my god. What about Stove? Are we cool that we're still married and we're in different families? Okay, cool. What happens to those dead bodies that are up there? I saved you! See, it was good! Wait, what happened to Taliesin? We missed him?! Oh no, was he upstairs with the werewolves? Wait a minute. How come Taliesin didn't come to our defense? Grog is DM.
