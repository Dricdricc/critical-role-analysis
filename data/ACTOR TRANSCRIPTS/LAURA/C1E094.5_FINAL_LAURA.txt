(muffled) Hi. I'm eating a piece of pizza. We have merch in the store. We're all out of dice, but yo, we've got the t-shirts, we got some hats, we got patches and vinyl stickers. We got all sorts of shit. Go to the store! I know it's 4/20, the store kind of looks like a weed dispensary. But it's not. It's a straight-up Geek and Sundry store. Oh! That's good. Oh wait, no, I was looking at the wrong one because it's so bright. That's the one we're looking at. Woot! Is that you? Oh, okay. (laughs) Liam and Sundry. Hey. We share that birthday weekend, don't just call it yours. So, it just got announced! A new game that I'm working on called Farpoint! Got a story trailer for it, it's a VR game for Sony PlayStation VR, it's totally cool. I tweeted out the story trailers, if you want to go check it out. It looks super awesome, and it was so fun to work on, and the story was really awesome too. And then last week, we released a cinematic trailer for Uncharted The Lost Legacy! And got a release date for it, which is August 22nd, which I'm very excited about, as well! Woo woo! Is it purple? Tell me it's purple. Ooh, nice. How do you spell Paizo? (gasps) Are they made out of radishes? Just to hang out. No. Do not make us get up right at the beginning. How's it feel, Matt? Liam O'Brien killed a pug! [no audio] I knew it! Ow. Wait, who are you? You're Sam? Sam? Sam, you're a kid! What are you talking about? Your face is smaller but your teeth are the same size! (laughter) I'm Laura! You dick. Wait, who is that? Oh, it's that kid from that commercial. We're children! What the fuck happened? Hi. Yeah! I don't know! Where's Bixby? But he's a kid! Wait, how old are we? We don't know. Fuck yeah, I am. I'm so in charge. This is so weird. Where's Travis? (gasps) Oh god, what if he's still an adult? This is so weird! (laughter) How the fuck do we get out of here? And try to pull towards each other. Wait, what do we add to it? Ooh! I'm so much older than them. I got an 18. What do we do? Yeah. Yeah! And we fought him, and we killed him. And you almost killed Travis! Where's Travis? Was that a time shift? Did we just shift through time? Are we older? Wait, give me a boost, I'm going to climb up the beam. I'm going to try to climb up the beam, because it's covered in vines, right? I can grab on to something. Okay. I'm going to try to climb up to the top. Do I add anything to it? 15! And I don't see any other sign of life? Do I add anything? 18. (gasps) Well, I climb down and I say, I saw a body, and we should go find it! Sure! Yeah, but we should get over there quickly, because that's Travis! It should be. I think it's Travis! Be careful of the bulging sausages! Of the wet, bulging sausages! Yeah, yeah, we're sneaking. Oh. What do we add? Ooh, that's good. That's a pretty die. Seven. Plus I'm really worried. Does it look like I would know what Travis looked like when he was a kid? (gasps) Travis! And I go slap him awake. How old is he? How old are you? Do I look older than you? Oh wait. You-- no, you're still a kid, you're a kid too. Baby! You know what I look like when I'm a kid, man! I'm your wife! You're my husband. You know you wore shit like that, don't even. Ashley? Ashley, it's us. And Taliesin! It was really good! Because you're a kid! You're like you in What Women Want. (laughter) No, younger than that. I run over to the other body, and see what kid it was. Do I recognize him? I hope this isn't anybody we knew. And it's a kid body? That's fucked. Oh. Do we have our weapons from before? We've got to find some sticks! Everybody get a stick! Yes, you do! Don't cry. We're still adults, Travis. We're just in kid bodies. (gasps) I grab a rock. And hide behind anything that we-- I hide hide under one of the petals of one of the flowers. I'm in a dress. (laughter) Do you guys see it? Are we hiding? Are all of us hiding?Yeah, smells like a dead body. Oh. Should I come out? Man. Should we find Matt and Marisha, because they were with us too? Are they the ones that got us here? Oh yeah, they saved the day. They killed Conan, didn't they? I turn around and throw my rock at it! Nine. Nine. Don't I get that attack? Because I threw a rock. You'd argue so hard for that if you were over on this side, man, you would've argued so hard for it. It's me! Okay. We still haven't opened our things! Do I get to go? Well. Okay, I guess I'll try and hit it with the rock while Ashley's trying to-- 15! Four! Well, Ashley, you-- Thanks, Travis and Taliesin. It's dead! Far away? The same place? Fuck yeah! Dragon Ball Z bowling shirt! Ah, yeah. Aw, Hawaiian shirt Matt! You're so cute! I also was very small. Our mental state? I'm down two hit points! I've only got eight hit points! No, no, I had eight. Yeah. Jeez Louise, Liam. What do you have? (gasps) You have a high constitution. Did we catch up? He's not out of the flower yet. Oh, I can still see! Can we try to pull the flower back? Just Matt. It was a cat! Yeah. It was hairless. Oh, Ashley's got it, still. Yeah! Look around, we're in giant fucking plants. We're fucked! Travis has been mentally brought back to that age as well. There's that. Right. I was in the science club! (laughter) Oh shit. How did they get in here? How did you get in here? Does anybody see anything? Like, super badass. You don't remember that? We were recording and then we fought Conan O'Brien-- Did you see anything-- I want to break off a few sticks and try to turn them into sharp daggery sword things. That's fine, I'll be covered. Does it smell like blood? Yeah, but you know how druids work, Marisha. Is it blood? I'm going to hide. I'm going to hide behind the flower that Matt came out of. I hide. 22. Wait, you have spells? Five! Oh my god, there's so many of them, we're all going to die. Why? Scary! She's really intimidating! I'm going to hold my attack until one of them comes closer. I have those two sharpened sticks like daggers, yo! Well, I mean, I suppose so, because I don't know how to make a throwing stick. Yeah. But I want it to be sharp, I don't want to just throw a stick at something. No, I want to wait until-- I'm under a leaf. We're hiding. They're not? Well, fine, I'll run out there and back up Ashley. I'll go stand next to Ashley. And then I'll pull my sticks out and wait. And wait until they get closer. I've been shamed by Sam to come out of fucking hiding. I've only got six health points right now, bro. Are you going to rage? They're really mean, Marisha! They have claws! I'm going to stand, walk around them-- Yeah, but back. Just stay behind them. Back further. Further. Yeah. Basically, I walk over so I can see. And I ready my sticks, and I'm going to save my action. We should probably get out of here before more cats come. I think they did it because Ashley's fucking scary as shit! You're really cool, Ashley. Oh wait, what? Okay, well, try to find the fucking old guy! Maybe because he knows you know the old guy. Well, let's go find him. So cute. Can you turn that stick into a weapon? What does that even mean? How do we get home? (gasps) We should head towards Geek and Sundry! Keep following the guy. Yeah, I climbed to the top of the tower. It's jungle everywhere. Let's follow the old guy! No, all I saw was jungle. I mean it's a jungle here. It's a desert, really. They're not normal trees. They look like engorged sausages. As we go, we should keep our eyes out for anything that we can use as weapons. There's nothing metal? Matt! Can you heal me? I saw you heal Marisha. Can I try to close up my wounds that I got? I'm running after Travis. Yeah, I'm following Travis! Let's start running. Who's charging after him! Can we yell out to him? Hey! Stop running, what the fuck. We're just trying to figure out what's happening! Hey! Oh, come on! We keep going. Oh my god. We're going to die! For real! Hey Matt! Thanks for healing me! 17. What is that big thing? What? Where are we? The demogorgon? I think-- Matt, how do you kill these things? I have nothing. I'm just going to back up further into the water. Can I hold my breath and put it under the water and see what I can see under the water? Yeah! What?! Bubbles! (laughs) I come back up out of the water. We're surrounded! There's something in the water! (scream) Just a little poo falls into the water. I think I'm going to just stand back in the water and continue to scream. (screams) Get back in the water! Get back! It just killed Marisha! Get back in the water! And then I'm going to try and jump up and see if I can reach Travis's leg. I can't reach you! I see it! I'm just staying. I'm going to stay and just hold my sticks. Oh my god! As soon as I see it tear apart Travis? I'm going to just turn the other way and just start swimming out. Nope! Nope, nope, nope! I'm going to take my stick and hit it! He's definitely bloodied. Gross. Oh no! Oh no! Me and Matt and Sam. I think he doesn't realize you're there. I'm going to take my sticks out and I'm going to try to stab the tentacle that's holding me up in the air. Do I add anything? My dex? 11. I'm trying to break out my grapple. Oh. Well, I'm just going to try to-- no, I'm going to attack the tentacle. Oh, then I try to break out of the grapple! I don't know what I can do as a bonus action. I can't disengage; I'm not a high enough level. I'm just a me. Yeah, level of Laura at 13, 12, or whatever. Okay. 11! Oh no!
