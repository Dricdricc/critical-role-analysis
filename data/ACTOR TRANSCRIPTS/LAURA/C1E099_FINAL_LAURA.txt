Yes, we do! Oh, well I know some of you have been wanting to hear more about Scanlan, and we thought it would be great to release a concert tee of his. Wait, turn around, because it's even better on the back. (cheering) Yeah, and it's pretty cool, so there's that. And that's in the store right now! Go check it out. That's right. That's right. Maybe, maybe we'll see Scanlan in concert sometime. Yeah, before he was famous. Marisha, you've got a little food on your mouth. Under your lip. You got it. I'll be in Las Vegas this weekend for-- No, for Gears of War event. So if you guys play Gears of War competitively, come out and fight and then see me while I'm there. No, but I'm going to cheer people on, though, real good. (laughter) I've got one. I didn't put it on the list. But it's a present for Liam O'Brien. (cheering) I wrapped it all pretty, open it up. Open it up! It's just a pile of blue poop. Did you see it? You're welcome. I don't know if it will fit you, but you know, happy birthday. Did it fit? I guessed it! Yes! Well, all right. How are we positioned, again? Okay. Do you have any spells left? Why do you want that? Oh, we have to kill all the fuckers? Maybe we just get high enough that they can't get to us with the acid, and then we just fire things down at them. No. What? Why? They're already at the top. Percy and I just fly up and we start firing down. Yeah, but they'll gather in the spot to get to it. You had to think about it. (laughter) I think we have, like, 40 or 50 of them left, right? And they're burrowed, now? (gasps) I wonder if we could send fire into the caves where they've burrowed? What's too big? That's a lot. We might have some stuff in the Bag of Colding. Wait, wait, wait! Did we also destroy the mine? I think we did a good job. What time is it now? Yeah, we're really, really good. Blink-blink! He almost said it back. We're starting something. We're leaving. Do we need to tell your family what we did? Right now. In the morning? Well, I haven't actually had the drink yet, I was afraid it might be poisoned. (gasps) Percival! How is he? You're fine? All right, fine. All right. Congratulations, us. Maybe later. We should probably heal up. Talk to your father in the morning. It's in your name. You could kick your dad out! I hear the Myriad's giving really good deals. Well, we've slept in blanket forts before. Oh, kinky. You could've just used Trinket. Potatoes! We just used up all of their food and they don't have any left. English breakfast ale! It's super important. I like her a lot. Sweat pants! Did you want some stew? Oh, did you want some as well? The deal we made with the Myriad, sir... No one would know that you were forced out of your home. Everyone thinks that this was your choice, that you're being charitable. Oh my god. Sure, sure. So... But we just finished your room! I like it! I like dicks! No, but you're so good at selling stuff! I feel like some people come in just to see you and see you smile. What?! No! Let's go to Whitestone. Let's leave. I don't like this place anymore. Tree Stride! Traveling salesmen? I nudge my brother. I head-nudge him. We know it's there, though! Oh, wow, yeah? What kind of help? Do you remember your name? It's a much better name. Or, like, dragon kind of issue? You! Where are you from? I'm going to throw something again at Sam. Wait, what does he look like? Short guy? Is he this size? Well, we don't know, maybe it is! Where are you from? The ships? But will you bring us to him? The one you were about to say. We were going to hear you say it before-- Wait, Chod! Chod! Lionel's way better. Vax. Vex. Just say Vex. So, wait a minute, so he's like a bad guy? But do you know a girl that looks kind of like the Meat Man? Hey, that's great! Aes Adon? But he's actually the Meat Man. And what do you think? What do you judge on us? You seem really great, too. You should probably take us to him, then. Yeah! We feel the same way sometimes. Maybe Scanlan's trying to play us and he accidentally sent someone that-- It's got to be Scanlan. What other weirdo would name themselves Meat Man? Lionel! I go search the drawers. Yeah! I start searching. He gave me free rein, I'm searching this fucking place. Should I be investigating, too? 11. Scanlan! Scanlan, are you here? I want to roll a perception, I want to see if it's an illusion, if it actually is Scanlan. 25. Yeah. Did you go inside of it? Did you see anybody around? Does it count if it's a girl that he's talking to? I mean, it's not quite the same, right? What? Oh no! Such a shame that's he's been lost. A whole team. With one pistol. I don't think he would be able to reverse engineer it. Everybody earmuffs! Well, up until a few weeks ago, Grog couldn't really spell, either. Give it a moment. I go and I follow him. I follow him right out of the room. Aes. I run up and I hug him. Just a big hug! And I go down. Oh my god! [break] Of course. Scanlan! What are you doing? I mean, I knew it was you, but I thought you were going to reveal yourself to everyone. Have you been there the whole time? I hold his hand and just listen. Are you really the Meat Man there? Darling. Okay. Don't you do it. Don't you do it! I push him against the wall. Can I break it? Can I break it before he does it? 24. No! I grab his hands and cover his mouth! Do I add to it? Dex modifier or dex saving throw? Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shush! Everyone, shut up! Shut up, shut up. If you need to do something, change back, do it. Appearances are important. No. You've just been going crazy with that Modify Memory, haven't you? Should we go inside? It's an empty fucking bar. Sure. Look, this is that guy we were telling you about for so long. Pike... Talk to them. Don't let them leave. I would've stopped you, darling. I knew it was him right away. I try to pass my hand through Lionel's stomach to see if he's actually Kaylie. Serious, serious abs. Did you go inside? Did it look like he was in pain? Was it a lot of guys? How long ago was this? I get sick, too. I understand. So, wait, and then you saw Allura there? That's bullshit? Oh. Oh, you suddenly lied to us. Wow, I feel so shocked. Remember? We deserved it. You always were. I think they'll come around. I think more than anything they've just missed you, darling. He's full of shit. He totally said that you were never coming back. I knew. Of course. Ooh. I like it. Scanlan. I think you need to talk to them. Pike didn't get to say a word to you when you left. Grog was... Grog was hurt. Maybe a little bit of breathing room, and then, yeah. Oh. Well, I mean, yeah. I'm sure Scanlan still has his. He can probably hear us talking right now. Oh no! Oh no. Yes, we are. I thought we all said we went. We don't have to be. Okay, then no. We're not there, then. How are you doing, Grog? Are you still okay? Are you bloodied yet? You're not there. I figured we just sat under the Sun Tree. Yeah. I was so happy to see him. No. We've got to find a way to get them talking again. I know. Couldn't let him know that, though. Mm-hm? With Keyleth? I know, right? Yeah. I miss it, too. Yeah. Yeah, probably Ank'harel. Yeah, I'm fine. No, I'm great. You know, it's interesting, Scanlan being back. Makes me realize that, you know, he's not the only one who keeps secrets. And you can't blame someone for keeping things to themselves, so I'm not mad at him anymore for the things that he keeps to himself, because everybody's got their something, you know? No, I'm just saying, I understand where he's coming from, and I am all right with it now. I'm fine with it. With the secrets. No, nothing at all. I think they will. He's quite charming. I think everyone will come around. The Sun Tree? Pelor? Raven Queen? Hey! (laughter) Time for what? (laughs) Oh, did you buy that off a little caravan? That's great! It's really nice. It's really nice. I love you. Glad we're all here. I'm glad we're all here! Yeah! Grog? Are you all right? You're so smart! Do we see Pike come out after him? Pike? What happened in there? Pike. Well, we don't really need to roll an insight check to see this one's not doing so well. Everything will be better in the morning. Oh, shit, he beat my passive perception, too! Seems nice. I don't know what to do either, dear. I think it's a matter of... Forgive. Well, it's going to take time, I think. I'm surprisingly okay with it. I'm just happy he's back. I'm very worried about him and Pike. Five of us, Tary is there. Are you sure you can't stay? Can you stop flirting with each other? I think they were going to bed, but we can try. Oh, we're definitely doing this. We're going to Ank'harel. Pike? Grog? Did you put your earrings back on? Scanlan. I think they're really depressed, dear. I'm just letting you know their earrings are off. They can't hear us. Say you're sorry. Well, go fucking find them. They wander everywhere. Where do you want to go? Well. Pike and Grog went back to their rooms. It's up to you. No, no, no, Scanlan. Scanlan, it takes time. Things take time. Scanlan, where are you? Shit. Stay there. She can't, I don't think she's wearing the earring. Unless she put it back in. Oh, seriously? Right there? Well, no, we're coming with you. You're not just leaving us again. You just got here. Okay, okay, shut up everyone. No! Yes, you were, we didn't tell you to go! Scanlan, we said don't go! No! Fucking Keyleth said that! We're not telling you to fucking go. Yes! Holy crap! What was under the blanket the whole time? Oh my gosh. That was so much fun. Oh my God, next week's our 100th episode! How fucking weird is it that we got the T-shirts released... Yeah, we've just been working on this shirt for a while. And it came out this week.
