Oh, goodness gracious! Oh my god you guys, he's a puppet! Oh, and it's up on a thing! Matt, who sent these to us for our birthday? Zac! Travis is outside. Ooh, that's some fancy grog happening. We all got presents, Grog! Oh, wow! Another one? A new carpet! Say, "Vex is awesome." Say you love Trinket. That's ears. And Scanlan is still invisible? Right, okay. Maybe Scanlan can just stay perfectly still, and you and I can just hide so that Scanlan can-- I think we should duck and hide under his covers. His big, nasty fur bed. I go! Should I grab Scanlan and pull him in? Ugh. Oh, god! Oh, it's the Underdark! Ugh! I'm switching dice. Okay, that's much better. That was horrifying. That's a 22. This is stupid. Oh no. MATT AND Against his nasty-ass scent? Oh no! Why? Okay, 18. Shh! Shh! Shut up! Make some noise! Oh god. I know, I just wish-- Maybe call him back here and we can tie him up. Is that dumb? Make him sit down. Oh, okay. Wow. Can he talk? Oh! So he's really small. Should we capture him, or should we just-- I don't think you know how big he is-- Thanks, vomit-y brother. Can I bust out my rope of infinite twine and start tying it around him? Just, a lot? A lot! Just a whole bunch. As much as possible. Because it's infinite, this twine! Oh shit. Great. Oh, should we just run? Scanlan is outside. Ah! Against my AC? Oh no, that hits me! That doesn't count. We need you! Scanlan, you got me killed! Oh no, it's starting. We're already in the giant battle. Oh wow. Do I have a reaction? Can I jump away as a reaction? Can I hit my earring up, and go Giant! Giant! Being attacked! Help! And I'm going to take out one of my-- Hunter's Mark! And one of my Sleep arrows. And I want to shoot it with my Sleep arrow. I have a Sleep arrow. I bought them. But I want Tiberius to make me more. I've asked for more Sleep arrows, if you can make them. Oh shit. And that, I know! But after the rope, I'm going to try to Sleep. Sleep arrow first. Yeah. Oh, okay. I'm going to do the first arrow and then I'll try to put him to sleep. Okay, smart. Thank you. I know, right? 25 for the first hit. Oh, then eight, and-- 16 for the first hit. And then Sleep arrow. LAURA and Eight! Eight plus seven is 15, 16, 17. Plus Hunter's Mark. Oh, no! Oh sweet. Eight, 16, do I add the two for the bracers on that? Okay, 16, 20, what is that? 23, 24, 25. Plus Hunter's Mark? Five for Hunter's Mark. Oh, really? That's 12, okay. 16, 28. And then I get another-- Wait, one more. MATT AND 47? Oh, come on, come on. Man! That would have been-- that's impossible! Oh, that does make sense. He can't tell us that. Did I still do 47 damage on that Sleep arrow? Or that was just-- Okay, okay. All right. I want to run as far away as possible from him. You're not groggy at all, you little-- And he doesn't hit me. Sweet. Oh god! All right, come on, meteorite. No, don't come in close, seriously. Honestly, he can still get you from where you're at. Unless you move further away. 31?! Nice. (sultry) Jump up his body. Because you hit him in the eye. Ugh. He's huge! Hi. I'm going to do Hail of Thorns on him. Yeah. 26? Okay, so that would be-- I'm doing it at a level three, so that is 3d10. 15, 16. That 16? Yeah, 16 damage for that, plus my Hunter's Mark. 17. And then my second attack? All right. 17? 15, 16, 17. Oh, plus Hunter's Mark! Five for Hunter's Mark. Oh! Yeah! Woo! For what? All right. Ooh, I like it. Oh, we haven't rolled! Say something, Grog! Yeah! Oh! That's me, I'm an eight. That's Trinket, too. Look at how big he is compared to us! Okay, yeah. Because he's really stinky. Whoa, whoa! Oh. It worked! I think it worked! So disgusting. That's not pitiful! I think we're trying. Oh no! That's an edge, with a 15-foot drop. 15. You're going to constrict him? That's big. That's me. I am going to-- Has he taken a lot of damage yet, or are we just keep grappling him? All right, I'm going to attack him, twice. The second time with a-- I'm going to scootch up there so I can. And I'm going to take two shots at him. All right. 24, 26! Second attack is a Sleep arrow. Yeah. 17. Yes. 15, 16, 17, 20? And then the second one-- That's ten, 11, 12. 16 on the second hit. Oh, right, I only get 5d8. Oh. Okay. Look at all these dice I have! 14, 20, 22? Yes! TRAVIS and Yeah, I have three. Now I have one! Shh. No, don't wake him up. Don't rock him. Oh, Clarota, can you Dominate him? Okay, yeah. (sounds of protest) But you can't control its body? Yeah, can we quickly tie him down while we're talking? Oh, yeah! Let's frickin' tie him down. At least can we tie him up right now? It's a big ol' feast, I know, I know. It's a lot of food for you. Clarota, what about the thing he was carrying? Can you eat that thing's brain? Chain it up. Can we just use chain and tie him up? We have chain. Grog has chain. We chain him up! Percy and I chain him up. We use the chains that we have. We have chained him. I know, we do have some more never-ending rope. And we can keep using that. A lot of it. No, no, no. Yeah, let's do it. Keyleth-- Oh, never mind. Can anybody make it look like there's a big feast in front of him? Let's do it! (whispers) What are you doing? I do. I speak back to him. And say, "K'Varn. For him, or against him?" Oh, got it. Oh, it's, (gibberish). Be all like, 'kh'. Yes, yes. Very good. (retching noise) Hmm? Oh. Should we take the chains off? Make him agree, first. Okay, cool. I start taking the chains off. Very carefully, taking the chains off. Oh, okay. He wants to know where. Tiberius, do you speak Underdark? But tell him to stay for now. Pike, do you want to tell him what she said? Okay. Go ahead and translate that. Will this keep up while you're sleeping? Just curious. Oh we're set. Can we heal him? If we heal him, will it cancel it? What? I grunt at him. And ask what his name is. "Vex-'ah-lia." Oh, come on. I think we should name him-- We should name him Tiny. What is it? I feel like we should hop down into the pit. No no no, not that pit. In the big pit. And rest. And that way we're blocked from view. Tiny. Right? Oh. Well, can we ask him? Can we ask him, I mean, if K'Varn is annoying to him, or if he likes him? Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, that's true. No no no. We'll come up with an idea, but, I mean, it's something. Keyleth, is it safe to sleep next to him? Or is he going to attack us when we sleep? Yeah. Maybe we can chain him up to something while we sleep. Oh, fine. Who's taking the first watch? All right. I gotta heal up. Are we? Why not? Okay, tell us why. Okay, yes. Please, tell us. The temple that you won't set foot in. You want somebody else to go into. All right. Do I know that? Do aberrations need to breathe? All right. Okay, I've also got an idea. I mean, what about that whole plan to break apart the apparatus that was holding the Elder Brain together? I think we need to go over the top, once the distraction is in the city, blah blah blah. Go over the top, acid that metal, break it apart. I think it'd be hard to get the giant up to the top of the temple. But this is a brainstorming session, everything's positive. Acid, whatever, break it apart. Release the illithids from his control and then we'll have them on our side. At least, not our side, but against him. All of the illithid in the city are his prisoners. He's controlling everyone. Oh, okay. That's good. I like your plan so far. Yes. Ooh, I like that. You know what, though? The beholder will just take control of the giant. I think we should keep the giant as a distraction. Yes, Grog. And then also another idea. What if you used your Pillars, right, against the Beholder and trapped him in? Can you do that? All right, all right. What if you're outside the temple and you cast Pillars and then we go in? And you stand outside, Tiberius. What if you're on top? That gives us something to hide behind, right? At least, with his eyeballs. Yes. A mile. What are we going to do? We're just going to go in without a plan? What are we going to do? Oh, we can do it in the morning? The big one is releasing the Elder Brain. We need to do that before we teleport. Right, so we know what's going on. I feel like we should get up close, release the giant, fly up over, do our shit, and then take him. Acid. We have acid. And we've got a bunch of acid in Grog's bag. Do we have any metal? No! Oh, Percy, why? No no no. Don't. On jewels. That's okay. Sapphire's okay, then? Is it clean? Does it have any acid still on it? I know! I think a big weight, once it's been acid-ed. Well, it's on the top of the temple, that's what I mean. If you can jump on it, then we'll be going down with it. What if cursed giant lands on the metal beam after we've already weakened it? Yeah, that is good. No no no. Not if he's alone up there. What if we do it, do it, do it-- Can we remember? I have advantage to recall information. We didn't want it to happen, we just were making sure it wouldn't. Okay. What if you cast Featherfall on it as, right when we did it, and then we can move it out of the way? Clarota? What about-- Why Clarota? The giant Tiny? K'Varn? Oh, he's warming up to it. I think he's liking it. I thought the Elder Brain was directly below it, so it would have to step on the Elder Brain in order to-- Okay. Me! Or chain. Or just swing it. Right, yes. We can swing it. Flying carpet. Because all his stealth checks lately have been perfect. Let's do it. Let's nap. I love him. Or Vex. Whoever. Oh, he's going to drink the whole cask down? Oh! He's so happy! Oh look! He's farting! Oh Tiberius! Some farts! Look at those farts! Oh my God. What are you doing? Good Job, Tiberius. Wait! Do you want to do his foot first? (groans) Oh, come on! (laughter) It looks disgusting! Ugh, get it out of my face! Do it level one. Sorry, brother. It's almost healed. We got a big battle, brother. Shouldn't have fallen asleep in that-- Sorry, your nubbin lives. No no no. On the carpet. That's adorable. Be careful! Plan? What's that? Well? It's a city. We need the Elder Brain. You wanna go against illithid? They'll take you over and then we'll fight you. I like it. TALIESIN AND We'll be going in over the top, trying to get rid of the thing controlling the Elder Brain. Yes? Actually, I agree with that. If he's being controlled by you, can he not be controlled by another being? I like it. They don't like Clarota. They aren't going to listen to Clarota, especially if they're controlled by another being. We're going to tie a chain to it. I feel like that uses way more time because what's going to happen is once it happens, it's all going to go to shit. So once we drop it, we should probably just fucking go. Maybe, Keyleth, you could turn into a bat and tell them all to go a different direction. If it comes up, we'll deal with it. How about that? None of this is a surprise. None of it's a surprise. He knows we're here. Okay, okay. What if we use a giant net and two of us get up on the carpet and we use a big net and catch as many bats as we can. Do we have a net? Oh, good call. Great. Do you know where those entrances are? Your name's Clarota. I'm sorry. We can just drop things in from above on the temple and stay out of the temple. Maybe just give up on the smoking out? Is that the one where you call your deity? So we would know if she's going to help us? Or would she help us that moment? Right. Percy-- Well, are you going up top? That could be Keyleth. Yeah, you guys, could you guys be in charge of closing up the entrances? Sure. Here you are. Take it, give it to me after it's done. Damn it. Good try. Good try, Percy. Okay, yes. Good-- Good thinking. Stay up top as long as possible? We're not going into-- What if we can just attack from the roof? From the opening in the roof. Is that possible? Can we attack from the roof, from the opening in the ceiling? Can we attack him from up there? We don't have to go in. Maybe we drop the thing, attack from above as long as possible, and hope the illithid attack him. Nobody go in the temple, everybody attack from outside. Oh, I was thinking it was just like a giant pyramid, with one roof. (laughter) That makes so much sense, though, that it's not. (laughter) Yeah. Oh god. So this is the beam. And we're going to attack this one and this one, yeah? Oh, is it like that? Oh god, I'm picturing it so fucking different. Okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Like that. Okay. The Elder Brain. So we're going for one side of it. And it hopefully goes-- Okay. I feel like you'll be fighting a lot more things. I think it's better to just go from the top, and drop in if we have to. Then we run. We run away. How will we follow you if you're on a carpet and we're standing on a thing, and-- Yeah, okay. Oh god. Okay, so, are we doing it? Yeah, Clarota. Oh, good. Question. When you guys were flying overhead, the top of the temple is wide enough for us to stand on, yeah? Can we stand on the wall of the temple? Okay, okay. Okay. Attack the beholder when it's dropped there. Eat. Food. Big eyeball. Oh my gosh, Tiny, you're tiny! He still smells really, really bad. Oh, I'll just keep him with me. Yeah. Are we going to Polymorph Grog? And Trinket. Can anybody shrink Trinket, too? Scanlan. Scanlan. Yeah. Who can shrink my bear? Can you cast Fly on Trinket and ride him? I'll ride him, if somebody casts Fly on him. No. That's not a compliment, Scanlan. You promise you'll take care of Trinket if I go-- Can Trinket go in a smaller group? He'll fit on the carpet if there's a smaller group? But that's casting it twice. No, he can't ride the carpet, we just said that. Trinket. Yeah, Trinket wants to be by my side, you guys. We don't need to if we burn a spell, because Trinket's the one that can't fit on the carpet in the first place. Everybody else can fit on, right? Well, but Grog won't fit on the flying carpet. This is a really-- This is like a mind puzzle. 20 minutes? So we can both Fly? I cast Pass Without a Trace on the entire party, before we all take off. And you add ten. 18. Okay, so you dropped us off. Oh no. Plus ten? Yes. Are we waiting? That's so cute. Oh, um, yeah, that's-- No, plus ten would be 11 because he rolled a one. Forget about it. Inspiration, Inspiration! I heard her say, "I cast--" I have the mouse. While we're standing there, I pull out an arrow and I'm tying the little tiny mouse onto an arrow. Pass without a Trace. Can anybody cast Dispel Magic? I have that. He's right there, though. Flying next to us. He's secure. It could also hurt Grog if he's touching it if it's that hot. Okay. What if we just give old mousey here-- Turn him into a giant again and drop him right on it? I've got him notched on the arrow. Okay, we bring him up. Tiberius, me and you? But we're going to drop him as a full three-ton weight. We'll aim him towards the part that will break. And the three tons, so we want him to be a giant when he falls. Exactly. Fly it up. They might be controlled-by-K'Varn stitch monsters. (laughs) We are so high up. Can I see him? Can I go ahead and cast Hunter's Mark on him right now? Un-Polymorph him. Well, we splattered a giant, you guys. Pick who up? But we can hide over the edge so he can't see us, right? 16. What about the giant? Can you hide behind the giant splatter? Hunter's Mark. Okay, good. So, his eye would cancel out my Hail of Thorns attack? Is that considered, like, one-- Okay. Oh, that's true. Okay, then I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns on him. Oh. Okay, that's 29. Okay. Yes, I am. Okay. The secondary attack I wanted to shoot through my Bloodseeking Bow, though. That's probably not going to hit. That's a 13. 23. Okay, so I'm casting-- it's a 3rd-level spell on Hail of Thorns. Ah! Where's my d10s? Okay, I'm so nervous. I don't-- I can't find anything. Okay. There's a d10, there's a d10. Okay, so ten on that, plus Hunter's Mark. Six, so 16. That's the first attack. And the second one-- 14. Oh, I know. 14. Oh wait, I get plus two on that other attack, whatever it was, it was-- 16 plus Hunter's Mark. I'm sorry, my brain. Huh? Yeah. 19. And then the Bloodseeking Bow bleeds him. For ten damage each round. Might not be, right. Potentially. Oh, and I duck back as much as I can so I'm out of his sightline. Can I back up on the wall? I crouch down. Oh, good. He can fly. Where's, like the thing that fell? Is it blocking any sort of-- It's aiming at you. That's a d10. Come on, Clarota. Oh, Keyleth. We're not leaving. It's a cantrip. Away from Clarota. Maybe up against the wall or something? Second one was a 20. Get those monsters! 40. No, 39. 39 was the second one. Oh, the two together added up to 39. (laughs) Pendulum. Nice! (gasps) They won't pop back in your belt. Yeah that was your stealth. Right, well, I'm gonna just do the Hail of Thorns again. From above. Yes, as the first attack. Oh, right. It's a 19? Yes! Okay. So that's 3d10. Ugh, what? 28. Yeah, they do. 28, plus I get my two from my bracers, right? So that's 30, plus my Hunter's Mark-- 32 for the first hit. And the second-- I wanna do it with the fire string. Okay. Oh, disadvantage. That's-- Oh, that doesn't hit. Damn it. It was a 16. Yeah. So the second attack doesn't hit. Okay. I want to kind of duck down. Do I still get to move Trinket at all? He's still got Fly on him? He's just hanging out next to me on top of a roof? I just pet Trinket and tell him to duck down. (laughs) Oh, we're both ducking now. Dexterity. Tiberius. Can you rally the illithid? Stop being a dick. You can break the grapple though, right? You've gotta go from the side. You're not in a good spot! They could suck your brain out. That's me. Okay. I'm going-- Grog is dangling from him, but I'm still going to try to shoot him. I'm going to try to shoot him with the Ensnare arrow that I have from Percy. Try to maybe see if I can tie some of those stalks down to his head with it. Yeah? Yeah, like a little hairnet. The disadvantage was a-- What was that, 20? Yes! Okay, so what do I-- How do I do that? With the Ensnare arrow? 15, 16, 17. 19. Oh, okay. I didn't know that. Oh, I thought it was like a sort of wrap-around-y arrow. It wasn't like a-- I thought it was like a-- Yeah. That's what he told me it was a long time ago. Hopefully taking some of the stalks, pinning it to his body? Right. I know, I was just hoping I could pin a stalk or two. All right, the second one, with the burning bow. Wasn't that the same thing as the first one? Oh no. 15, 24? Okay, so. Ten, 11, 12. 16 plus ten for the burning. 19. And I duck down again and try to drop out of his view. 21. What are you at? Ugh. Again? He's getting it again? ASHLEY AND (laughs) I know. He hates you, Grog. Isn't he just a giant head? Okay. No, remember it didn't work. Wisdom, I think. Oh, well, it's okay. The high-- The first one was-- It would still be-- Yeah, we have a superior. And what does a superior do? It's like 100 hit points, I think? Blind it. No, I don't know. You can move. Yeah. He's almost dead, he's almost dead. Yeah, just throw a Fireball from the outside, just throw one. But you're not in the cone. He's looking down. You're going to get the fucking killing blow, man. Just, yeah, just let-- The carpet there. I thought Vax was up before me. Okay. I'm going to shoot an arrow at him. Hail of Thorns as a level three. That is, doesn't hit. That's a 14. Okay, cool. I can't do that again, can I? All right, then I'm just gonna shoot him through the flaming bow. I'm not going to use it. I'm just going to shoot him. This is fun, guys. 23. Okay. 13. And 15. 20 points of damage. I wanna-- Oh god. How do I want to do this? I do, I'm crying. I want to shoot him-- Is it possible to shoot him right where the horn meets his head and knock it off of him? All right, then I shoot him straight in the eyeball. Vox Machina! And I hug Trinket so tight. Ugh. He's zombie beholder now. Oh my god, is this like another boss? Kima's turning to stone. No, with advantage. Yep, she is. 45. Yeah. Yes we do! (sings) It's late. It's late. Oh, good to know. Oh, Kima! So you could still attack him? My magic attacks have been using-- Working from above, Tiberius. Shoot him. Get 'im. What? What just happened? Ew. What is that? I know, you're so ornery. We fucking brought you back in here. We told you to hit it. Crazy. We got a bunch of illithid coming in here soon. Fuck. Oh my god. We didn't die! He knows everything. He was evil. Oh, Pike, thanks. I know, it was my first-- Yeah. So sleepy. We still got a lot to do. Wait, I have a question-- Is the game going to continue next week, or are you guys taking a week-- Cool. That's amazing.
