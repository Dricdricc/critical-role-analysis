I was looking at his face as that was going on, was like-- (loud whisper) Can I have a pencil? I'm sorry. I just saw that she had pencils. Yeah, it's happening You got it. That's it? They might be gone already! It's gone, you got it. Early, early, early in the morning. We have a couple of Critical Role things tomorrow, so come say hi. I'm excited about that one. Oh, well, there's one little thing, which is that Travis and I are... having a baby! (cheering) That's available in the store. Very excited to not have to hide it on the show anymore! Thanks for blocking my belly the whole time. Yay! That's right. We rolled a character sheet for our baby on our announcement. Right now. Don't be shy baby, it's okay! What a good idea, Sam! No! (laughter) Oh, live-streaming the birth. We're going to Periscope the birth for sure. My goal is to go into labor while we're playing on a Thursday night. How great would that be? Where did Shakäste go? He's like the wind. (gasps) Maybe he was the Traveler! The Traveler. Well, yeah, mostly. Yeah. I mean, he takes many forms. Maybe I'm the Traveler. I mean, yeah, sure. I worship him, sure. He's more like my best friend. Probably. How do you know what the Traveler's like? Do you hang out with the Traveler too? Oh, right. Well, he's probably not the Traveler, then. Have you ever killed someone before? I'm okay with that. Oh, yeah! Who was it that had that stuff? Can I have it? I like rings! Ooh. What does it look like? Is it like a kaleidoscope? I don't know, what does it look like? Do they fit over your-- Ooh, then look at the ring that I want! He totally just took the ring from-- Ooh, do any of the rings that I have on my fingers have a pearl on them? (gasps) You have a pearl! Do you want me to carry it for you? Let's do it! I hope they have milk. I'm going to sit next to Caleb and watch it all happen. Don't you need to pull out your book so you can look at your spells? Oh. This is true. While he's doing everything he's doing, I'm going try to very subtly draw a dick in his book. Natural 20! It's our first item! What is it, Caleb? You can stand on and move across any liquid surface? Where did that come from? Probably. It was probably Nott. Wow, this ring is so cool! What is it? How fortunate. What is it? What is it?! Of course I do. Yeah, I'm on the level. LIAM  This is too dangerous for you to have. I'm keeping this one-- You have to tell us. Unless it's a wand that makes doughnuts or pickles, then I probably won't try to steal it, probably. No, Caleb! Yes! What does it do? Wait, he's doing it! Ah, oh Jesus. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Oh, 12. Oh, it didn't do anything? That's a very low DC, because I rolled shit. A DC. Yeah, that's a nine, right? It's a nein! SAM and Plus three. What kind of metal is it? To the blacksmith. I have a glaive. Look at this glaive. A glaive. Whoa! Is it too dangerous for me to have? What is a glaive? Is it something that I could use? Can I use a two-handed weapon? Oh, I have a shield. Yes. I need to get a better weapon, though, you guys. Because this sickle doesn't do much. It's really cool-looking, right? That's why got it. How's it balanced, is it good? No. Well, what does it do, because how much is it worth? Okay. Zadash. I'm writing magic glaive. (grunts) I don't know. Not me, because I drink milk. What is it? Can you shoot fire from your hands? Can you shoot lightning from your hands? Can you catch things really well? I don't like Caleb looking at our shit anymore. He just looks at it and steals it. (gasps) This is so cute. This is a great wand. I point the wand at Nott. (laughs) I pull the mask down. Oh my goodness. That's really creepy, Nott. How do I make it stop? I think it lasts for a while. Yes it's a Wand of Smiles. They have to roll a DC of ten for charisma saving throw or be forced to smile for a minute. That's the cutest fucking wand! I love it. We'll find out. Where's-- oh, Frumpkin. Frumpkin's gone. Okay. Oh. Well, you don't want to keep it. You hate burning people. You have to stick it on your forehead. What does it do? Look. This ring is perfect for you. That way if we get near water you don't go in it. Cheers to Caleb! Thank you, Fjord, for saving my life. Didn't you give me a potion? I woke up and you were over me giving me a potion like a knight in shining armor. I probably would have. Probably. I did do it for you though, Nott. I saved your life! I hold the wand under the table at Caleb's leg and try to do it to him too. It's charisma. You had me do charisma. You succeeded, but you didn't even know I tried. But we have always been roommates. Okay. Matt's totally taking advantage of the fact that none of us are hagglers this game. It's hard. It's really hard. Totally obvious that he's fucking us over. (imitates Crute's laugh) More money will come tomorrow because we are selling the ears tomorrow! Yeah! Of course, yeah, I have the ears right here in this pickle jar. No, I have them, it's okay. Like who wants pickled ears really, except for me? I'm going to go eat some pickled ears! No, I don't. I go upstairs and I'm conversing with the Traveler. I'm going to doodle and talk to the Traveler. Can I draw the general gnoll peeing on a little fire hydrant and the rest of the gnolls behind him fighting over a bone? Then I'm going to draw the cutest baby manticore you've ever seen and it's dead! I'm going to tell the Traveler You know, I don't know what's going on. I'm just hoping that you're here because this is the farthest I've ever gone and I'm afraid that you can't hear me anymore and it's freaking me out a little bit. Because I know that I'm around a bunch of people now and I haven't been before, but I want you to know that you're still my best friend and if you want me to be alone I will be if that means that you'll be here. Thank you. Okay, that's all, good night. What? Did you hear that? Oh. Right. Oh shit. I take the symbol and I hold it up to my cheek and I go to sleep. He's totally looking! Shakäste's. Wouldn't it be funny if there was, like, two copper and a bunch of bird seed? Shakäste was fucking loaded! Oh jeez. You stole an old blind man's food and money. The pearl pops out and flies across the room, never to be found again. One ear's up. Hey, what? Okay, what? Okay. I'm really smart, so I'll probably be able to figure it out. "Demedan, your request has "been approved and the toordolbo extract will be arriving in a case of rose wine from the Evening "Nip in the coming week. Many Gifts, The Gentleman." I don't know, but I like your addition of "douche" to Demedan, I agree. Oh yeah, who specializes in a rosé? You're right, that's weird. Especially not the Baumbauchs. No, they make, like, ale. "Toordolbo." Oh, bloodroot, that's good. What if it's the "boltodoor?" Bloodroot is probably pretty good, though. Would I know bloodroot? 20! Oh, bloodroot. That's right, it's a type of flower, super-duper red. I know because I tried to make a paint out of one of the flowers one time and it made me want to like seriously puke my guts out. And do the spins, if you know what I mean. Super bad. That's bad. That means it would be extra strong, yeah. Oh my gosh! Well, the Gentleman wants to poison people. Oh, no, the Baumbauchs, yeah, I understand. Wow, do we need to tell someone about this? If we hear about an outbreak of people vomiting-- Or about a rosé. Yeah. In the coming week! That's soon. When did you steal this? Oh my gosh, what if we could intercept it? Then we could have all of the poison, and the nips. I like it. Let's make a decision! We just did it! Oh man, I'm really hungry, though, I'm going to go downstairs. These ears. 19 sets. Yeah. No, it was 19 sets, I marked down sets. Technically Matt, I'm not telling Bryce this, five of those sets are hyenas. 14 of those are gnolls for sure. We also brought home live people and also some dead people. We brought home seven dead bodies. 25 gold a piece. How many live people did we bring back? I didn't have those in jars. That's right I did write down Herma and Jules, Petrov. Oh wait! Oh that's right. Wait, did anybody write down the amount that he said? Oh my gosh! That's so good! That's so great! We should have talked about this. What do you guys think? That's true we are. We're very strong. What if we're The Strong? The Mighty! That's good! Nein? Oh my god! Oh. Really? Are we staying here? I mean, do you want to keep hiring us for always? We're going to Zadash. Oh, I should ask you, is that like the big inn, the big place? What would be the biggest inn in Zadash? Like the biggest place that if you go like, "Oh, I need to find the biggest inn in Zadash," this is what it is? I just need the most popular one, because that's where my mom is going be sending me stuff. The Pillow Trove. Leaky Tap? Is it? You're little. Before we leave, can you tell me where Starosta Kosh's office is? Oh, we have some unfinished business. All right. Dermis is what I wrote down. Yes. Hi! Starosta, it's so wonderful to see you again. Yes. I was thinking a really good thing you could do for us in return is to give my friend Fjord here a letter of recommendation to the Academy. He did a great service to your city. Starosta, it's good to see you again. It's been a while, about, hold on. I get out my sketchbook and I look through it. Maybe like eight years almost? Your hair hasn't changed though, you should change it. The Ruby of The Sea says hello. Of course. Make sure he spells it right, Fjord. He really should have changed his hair, I mean it's pretty hideous. Oh, he visited my mother years ago. Yes, The Ruby of The Sea. You've heard of her? No. Well, she's mostly known for her hmm-hmm-hmm. Outside of that, her voice is amazing, you should hear her sing. What does what mean? She has sex for money! Mostly, I mean, people pay her a large sum. It's like three guys mostly, she keeps a few people at a time. She doesn't see everybody because she's super famous. You would, you really would. (singing) The Ruby of the Sea is the best lay ever! Yeah. Well, I wouldn't know exactly, because she never told anybody that I was there. I bet if she had, it would've been crazy. You know, in my room. Well, no I wasn't trapped, but you know-- She read me some stories. And a lot of times I would listen at the door and hear her sing. No. Exactly. I totally understand, she loves me so much. She really, really does. It's just, you know, people frown upon courtesans with daughters. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes! That's why I'm such a good painter. Oh, no, that came from the Traveler. Well, yes. Well, yes. But-- I feel so nervous all of a sudden, everybody's looking at me. Okay, so they were totally in love and she was going to marry him, and he was totally in love with her and he was going to marry her, and they said they were going to get married, and then she got pregnant with me, and he said-- they got married and he was going to go set up his house, and then he just never came back. I know, it is really sad. No, I'm going to find him so that I have somewhere to live because I'm not allowed to be at the house anymore. Well, because I'm kind of in trouble in Nicodranas. Well, because I sort of played a prank on this guy who was seeing my mom. Well-- so the Traveler taught me how to make myself look like other people, right? So, I made myself look like my mom, and then I lured him out onto our balcony and he was wearing nothing but this girdle of hers. And then I locked the door. And I thought that was funny, you know? It looked really good in my sketchbook. Yeah, which is no big deal. But then I found out he's a lord. He was really pissed off. It was in the day. Oh, everyone! It was so great. But he said he wanted to kill me and they said-- --that was cool and he could. So my mom was like, "Go!" and I was like, "Okay." Lord something something. Lord Robert something something. I'll remember it eventually. I thought so, too! He looked really good. I know, right? Well, I mean-- I know, right? I mean, I've never met him, I thought it would be cool. That's who I was looking for when I met Fjord, over there. I mean, he's supposed to be pretty darn cool. He wears lots of rings on his fingers too, you guys! Thank you, kind sir. Fjord, it's your letter. Bye. Thank you, Bryce. Me too. If you see a girl named Yasha, let her know we are on our way to Zadash. She's super scary looking, but she's got a heart of gold. Yeah, Yasha said she was going to catch up with us, I believe her. Do you want to hold on to your letter, Fjord? You're welcome, of course. I told you I would get you to the Academy. Yeah, right? It's only a matter of time before they don't. How old are you, Nott? Are you a little goblin? Or are you a normal adult goblin? Are you fully grown or are you still growing? Okay. Oh, okay. Are you okay? Today is your birthday, Nott? No. I'm sorry. But I do have this pickle in my bag. It was sitting in the jar and I put it in my bag because we put the ears in here. Oh yes, Fessuran. Let's go. Back on the road again. I like it. Who is going to be driving this thing? Oh, hey we're getting better! Marisha is broken! Are you okay? Tamarind. Look at that pen. Well, Nott slept in until noon, so we probably left a couple of hours after that. Is there a good place to make shelter? I'm just seeing you at Burning Man. I'll help him. Did you roll good? 17. You should use your glove and make a fire for us. Well. Unless something attacks us again. Why? Oh, okay. Never mind then. Who has a (fut fut)? Okay, then do it. I'll help. You're welcome! You know how to do that because you're on the road a lot. Yeah, of course! Yeah! That we'll sell to a blacksmith. Along with this giant sledgehammer! No, I have a sledgehammer too. I want to draw a sketch of them in a little pan popping like popcorn. What? (whispers) The Gentlemen. Are they going the opposite direction than us? (whispering) Should I ask if they're the Gentlemen? (shouting) Good to see you, Gentlemen! Oh. Yeah. Probably. Yeah, kind of. We find a good place? I mean, we did such a good job last time. Oh no, that is bad. Five. I find grass! Do we put an alarm around us in case? Oh! Wonderful. Nice. Should we three take watch since those three took watch last time? I'll take number three! Oh, no, that's where we got our syphilis from! He's just laughing. Do you get advantage? Because he's a friend? Spiritual Weapon! The guy that's been talking. Giant purple lollipop. I did. LIAM and Oh god, you guys, keys. (cheek popping) LIAM and MATT and TALIESIN and Is it plus five? I forget. Okay, yeah, 15. Yes. Seven points of damage. What!? All at you? Yeah, the sucker's just spinning in the air. Oh, already? Why'd you roll? He didn't even tell you. Jesus. I'm going to walk over to Caleb, while I'm doing this, and I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on him. 11. Hey, hey! I thought you had a cart; you were going to load our stuff onto your cart. Oh, well where'd you come from? That's so stupid. Well, then give us all your clothes then! That was so close to being good. Five! Take it off! Take it all off! Leave your weapons. How many are there? Make sure you wash your gold thoroughly because they're all infected with syphilis. The Traveler is with you all, forever and ever (low-pitched) and ever. Go away now! Oh man, did you see that you thought you burned that other guy up, did you see how much you burned that-- That's really good. I just go up and put a hand on each of them to cover the blood holes. I don't have any more hands, Caleb, don't do it, don't do it. Oh no! I put my knee up on the hole. Stop it. I'm going to cure your wounds now. Get ready for it, it's going to be so good. No! Cure Wounds! That one isn't as good, that's only four. Sorry. You pulled out all three of them at once, you know. Woah. I'll take Toilet. Okay. I feed Toilet so many doughnuts, I just feed him so many. I know, it's crumbs and moldy bits of pastry at the bottom of my bag now. I had, like, twelve stuffed in there. I'm out of pastries. I'm out of money and I'm out of pastries. Well, compared to what I had, this is bullshit. I don't know, it was a pretty big pile though. This is like not a big pile, this was like a big pile. Yeah! You buy clothes for your horse that draws your carriage, which is something I did. It was real pretty. Well, I think I left them on the side of the road, somewhere, actually. Why did I do that? I can't remember. I saw something super interesting. Shit. I see a lot of interesting things. Two heavy-- I'm going to make better notes soon, I'm just going to-- Two heavy crossbows, two light-- That's in addition to the two light crossbows? Two hand. Do you want all of them? No one else is going to use crossbows. 20, got it. Holy moly. Two daggers you said? He was going to keep second watch. Jesus Christ. Now we are all awake. You have major glasses indentations on your face. Then what the fuck is that from? That's commitment. No, Caleb go back to sleep, you're ruining everyone's sleep. They were already gone when you passed out. Go back to sleep. Is he always like this? Oi. Yes. It's six. Hey you guys, it's raining. Yeah. Yeah. I take my cloak off and put it around Toilet's head. See? The cold weather will be good for it. We're all on horses. Nott might be driving the cart, you might be sitting in the cart, but the rest of us are on horses next to the cart. I mean, it's pretty rusty. Like maybe to a museum or something. The Dwendalian Empire kind of sucks, you guys. I mean, the Menagerie Coast is really cool. Oh, it's amazing! I don't know, everything I've seen so far-- That's true. And Bryce was a soldier of the Dwendalian Empire? What's the capital of the Dwendalian Empire? Is it Rexxentrum? MATT and Yeah. Crazy. Do they like arts and culture in the Dwendalian Empire? Arts and culture. Yeah. Okay. That's good. I was taking in the rain, yo! I like it! Shut up! I could see it in my head! (gasps) Oh my gosh! Well, we should probably hit the Leaky Tap first, in the West Outersteads. It was in the West Outersteads. It was? Aww! Ulysses, are you going to flash us or try to sell us some watches? There you go! Can we insight check this motherfucker? Please. Natural 20! (cheering) I mean. I guess we can? I don't know, he just seems like a good guy some-- I mean, shifty. But I don't think he's trying to fuck us right now. Can I whisper to him? What do you have under that cloak? Is it weapons? He seems pretty okay, I guess. Unless we ask for it. And then you're welcome to do it. Does it look shady in there? I mean, are there people in there? Three actually because you got one. Well we need to-- We need to get to a blacksmith. Oh, we need to go somewhere that'll buy expensive-y magic-y things and somewhere that'll buy junky, shitty things. TALIESIN and So many whispers! That was one of the names of the other courtesans at the place my mom-- Stinky? The Pillow Trove. Is that in the Tri-Spires? Why? What kind of clientele? Are they super snooty there? Do they not like you very much? That's awful. Lot of people come through town? Let's not go there. Okay. I think we learned a lot. Oh, but Ulysses, we like you so much! Where do you stay? That's true! Oh man, I liked him. I'm almost sad that we didn't believe him at first. He was trustworthy enough that he wasn't going to, you know. I forgot to ask him about bakeries, so I am going to keep an eye out for them. Would we be passing through the Pentamarket on the way to the Leaky Tavern? We can sleep first and then get settled into the Leaky Tap, and then sell our shit tomorrow. Either way. All right. I want to try to sell the glaive here, if it's magic. If they sell magical weapons at this place. Firbolgs? Caleb, you're beautiful! I Invoke Duplicity. You're impressive! Jester. Oh, that's Jester #2. I know. I'm sorry about that. Enchanter Purvon-- Permansol? Pooman Sol. Pumat Sol. Do you guys deal in magical weapons here? Would you like to buy this? It depends on how much you want to pay for it. Does the fourth one look just like you? Yeah, there's four of them. Fleshrender. To see if he's-- I feel like this guy's a good guy. What do you think, Caleb? I don't know what that means. You said it needs a little decoration. I take the ribbon off my horn and I wrap it around the handle and I tie it on. What about now? We are looking for something that can hold a lot of doughnuts in it, and also maybe some other things that are heavy. Is this fantastic haversack-- Whoa. That's pretty cool. If we make this deal, does it come with a regular healing potion inside of it, maybe? It is a little cocked, but barely cocked. Ten. I really like it. It is a real good stick. I'm going to keep it. Utility here, I'm buying this sack for all of us here. Of course. And don't worry, once my mom sends me my care package, we'll have thousands upon thousands of gold. 200 gold for this beautiful bag. But! I feel like it could be a little prettier. Is there anything you can do to make it prettier for us? I'd really like, you know, pretty. I'm going to be carrying it, I'd like it to match my outfit. Pink! Ah! It's beautiful! 200 gold, here you go. Nope. We'll go somewhere else for that. I doubt you guys sell pastries. Do you know what's the blacksmith, if the-- where did I write it, it disappeared-- the Spark Hammer Smithing would still be open right now, or are they going to be closed? Okie dokie. Thank you so much. Man, I want to learn that trick real bad. No, where you make real versions of yourself that you get to hang out with! Why do you need them? I like them. But I like to eat them. How many tarts do I have? Then we all eat them. MARISHA and I have six left. That's okay, I have six left. Can we say we go and try to sell some of this stuff, or do you guys want to do this next time? Thank you guys for getting pastries for all of us. That was so sweet. There's so many people there. It's going to be so much fun.
