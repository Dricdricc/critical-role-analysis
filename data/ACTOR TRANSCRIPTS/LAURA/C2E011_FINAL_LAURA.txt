We're big fans. Then a little Kaiju cosplay for Charlie, because we were saying Charlie was a Kaiju level negative three, or something? Congratulations, Sam. Did she really? That's awesome! I'm sorry, Matt. I'm sorry, we love you. Oh, just that there's merch in there. Oh, the CR shirts that everybody loved, our throwback shirts, those sold out the first night. But it's okay, you guys! Because we're accepting backorders right now. So that's still available in the store. I know, right? Well. We just didn't think anybody would buy them. Letting you know that if you order them, it says it on the website, but you can check it out, it says they're going to ship in a couple weeks, depending on when they get printed again. Just know that if you order them there's a little bit of a delay, but it's fine, you can still get it. Put it in now, that way you can be sure you're getting it this time. Oh god, that was fast. Ulog. I'm tired. This was a long day. Are you guys going to keep drinking? Going to just drink at the Leaky Tap. I guess we won't sleep at the fancy place tonight. It's a pain in the butt. Nope, it was just kind of fancy. Mm-hmm. There was a minibar, but I think you had to pay a lot of gold for each little thing of it. Hey! It's like we don't even have to bathe, now. It was-- Should we go to sleep? We should fold up a blanket and put it under there, it muffles the noise. Like (tapping). Or like, (clicking). Yeah, I bet that would be annoying if you didn't like it. What about, like, (squeaking noises). Okay. Yasha. I didn't even know you were in the room with us! Yeah, we're all awake. I sit down next to her and I show her some of my drawings to the Traveler that I did before I went to bed. Look, Yasha, it's rat balloons. I show her a little drawing I did. Little rat balloons, and one of them exploding with poison coming out of it. No? Do you want me to draw you right now? I'll do it, okay! Okay. I draw her lit up by the lightning and then I go to sleep. Maybe the lightning exploded her. Yeah. Maybe she wandered out into the rain and lost her memory. Doesn't it? It seems possible. Probably. We should ask Molly. Yeah. What are your hit points this time? Yeah, I want to know. That's at least two kicks. (laughter) I'm eating a carrot, you guys figure it out. I will watch. I'm really good at keeping watch. It's really good. You look just like him only slightly shorter. Ooh, yes, butt chin! Those are always good! Ooh yes, and give yourself red hair. With red hair and a big patrician nose-- Ooh, that sounds really attractive. Molly. Yasha's gone. She was staring at the storm, and then she went away. Like in a protector, I felt safe when she was standing watch sort of way. We're very normal! I mean, you're weird. We already established that. What does that have to do with anything? I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows like this! Oh, this storm is so crazy! We might stand out a little too much. It would be easy to recognize us as part of a meeting like that. You're green, but mostly you look pretty normal outside of that. What do you want to do when we're supposed to be keeping watch? We could find a candy store. There were in Nicodranas. Did you want to go see Enchanter Pumat Sol? I have to return my key to the Pillow Trove. Because I have a key to The Pillow Trove. They're going to keep charging me a room until I give it back. Well, yes. Eventually she will pay for it. I don't want to waste all of the money she sends on paying for the room, you know? I'm trying to be smarter. Thank you, Beau. Because now you have a fancy coat! Oh! He's so wonderful. That's our new bodyguard. Oh, I want to pet a cow so bad right now, you guys. Attractive. You charged me an additional 200, but that was also giving you the glaive. We got a good discount. That glaive was really nice, shit. I have the card, but it doesn't say the cost. Ooh, it does, 1,350! Fuck! Oh shit. That's a pretty good deal compared to the-- Yeah. But, I mean, still. Buttons. A regular pouch can hold a lot of buttons. That's good. Whoa. That was a ring. It's like a cloak of AC? No, like resistance? Cloak of protection, like ring of protection. Man, I want a ring of protection again. We didn't put that in our-- Oh, I think I added it. Well, one of them. Did you spit on my thing-- Is this like, if I'm healing him, does he still get the double hit points? Sorry. We go back to the gate, right? You look really-- can I? I'm going to brush your hair out of your face. And like, wipe at any dirt off your face, okay? I know. Well, it's washed it off, but now I've got to get the smudges off. Because, you know, it's still kind of there. Well, you look sparkling clean! You look very dashing. Yes. Just keep your cloak really tight on you, okay? Oh, hello again. Yes. We're making our way to the Pillow Trove. That's all. Oh, Jesus. Okay. That was not a lot of flourish there, but 17! I know it did. (giggles) We made it! I know, right?! Should we ask where the smutty shop is that you want to go to? (laughter) I go back to the guard and ask where the Chastity's Nook is. Thank you very much, I appreciate all of your help, you've been wonderful, okay, bye. The Constellation Bridge sounds very pretty. I always am hungry! Really? Oh man, this bakery that we had in Nicodranas had amazing bear claws. Yes, and then we can compare and let you know. That's exactly what I was going to say! Cinnamon, yes! I don't know. Caleb, I'll buy you some porn. I want to buy Tusk Love, please. Sex and history. I love how many book titles you have. TRAVIS and On her? On the room? I walk up to one of the other patrons that's hurriedly looking through one of the books. Sure. Whatever one is closest to me. Oh no. Perception? 18. Ooh, Shallow Breaths, that's a good one. It's not one of your favorites? What's your name? I open it up and see what Shallow Breaths is about. Smutty. Yes. It's really good. Are there illustrations? Yes, I want to buy the Tusky Love one. (whispers) And I want to buy the other one that's expensive, please, thank you. (whispers) Yeah. But be secret when you put it in my bag, okay? While this was going on, and she was distracted. Can I find one of the books that looks easily accessible? I want to open it up and on the inside write "We're watching you. We saw you come in here." That's so good! Plus five, so what is that? 23? 23. That felt good. The pastries! Yes please! Thank you. You know you can buy mittens? It's weird, Caleb. It's weird. Well, it's really good bread. I think there's a casino here. But, we can just go to the Pillow Trove. That's why I'm going to the Pillow Trove! I heard Nott telling me something. She's beautiful. Who's that? You too. I don't know. I just asked who you were because you're really pretty. Oh! It's beautiful! You did a really good job in here decorating. Your dress is really pretty, too. I came to get all my stuff out of my room and then I'm going to give the key back, okay? I am, but I'll be back very soon because I have a package coming. So be on the lookout for one to Jester. That is me. Good bye. Did you see her eyes? They were golden. You want to see my room? No! It's okay because I rented it! I pull the covers off. Lay down! You want to lay down! You can use it! Why didn't you just light your hands on fire instead of putting it in bread? It's toast. It's actually really tasty. Little off. Open the curtains up! I'm dancing around the room while you're looking. Literally dancing around. Zauber. What makes it bullshitty? I was seeing if anybody left anything good under here. Did anybody leave anything good under the bed? It's pretty well-cleaned though, so nothing is here that's good. Not even any bugs or anything. Are you going to do something, Beau? I stick my head out. Are you planning a rebellion? Okay! I believe you. Oh, sure. I crawl out from under the bed. Caleb? I got you a present. I bought you history porn! Well, technically, you gave me the money for it. Is it useful? Is that the one I drew the dick in? Yes! Really? Are there pawn shops here? A porn shop? You read porn in school? Caleb doesn't want it. There you go. It was a present for you all along. Well, I wish I would have known. I would have bought you that other shitty book you bought. That's my name. You're welcome. I guess we can go back then. Are there any religious temples here? That's shit. Six. What about in the Pillow Trove? Do they have a little library there? Okay. No, I think I'm good. (singing) Let's go back to the stinky part of town. I guess I can go check out one of the temples. You probably got away with it. You looked like you were 30 when you were 18. I don't think we're going to kill him right off the bat. He could have a whole infrastructure of people supporting him and then they would come after us. Yeah. I mean we could hang out in the lobby in this bar, and I could watch every person that comes inside. I could draw their picture and know every single patron that's in here so that we have something to turn into the guards when we rat everybody out. Just be distracting! We're good at that. We will hang out up here and just be weird. Oh yeah, I have the "Tusk Love" too. I read it and I keep looking at Fjord like-- and then go back and read it. I assume it's about some sort of orc love. What's the name of the half-orc? Nothing, Oskar. Don't worry about it. (laughter) That's the helmet we found in the graveyard! Did it look like an undercover cop, trying to blend in? 20. Should we be outside too? Or should we stay inside? How will we know if you see anyone coming? Okay, you will Message us, and then you will Message the others? Can you do it twice? Okay. Then, we'll just hang out in here and have some fun. Is it just the four of them? (laughs) This is like us planning. "Taking a few licks." Yeah, lick those gladiator assholes! I really have! Does it say which one? This is weird. These are really, really, really good. That's a good fortune. You have a booger on the tip of your nose. Oh! I just told a random person they had a booger on the tip of their nose. You're a random person with a really familiar voice, though. You need to talk to Fjord, and see if you can figure out how to sound different. You were down there a really long time. We should follow one of them. Have the ones downstairs already left? Wait, blessings! It's like a dry skin. You got it! Stealth role. With advantage! She basically looks like a Pennywise, like a teeny Pennywise peeking through their-- Maybe tomorrow morning we can go spy on her house. It's hard to find that out without seeming suspicious, isn't it? But isn't it weird to go, "Where does the High-Richter live?" Oh, okay. Let's disguise ourselves. Yeah! Do you want the rest of us to go tomorrow, or do we still need to be look out? Should we look like ourselves or other people? I don't care. Okay. I'll decide on the day. Maybe we can ask the owner of here. Yes? Okay, I'm going to go ask Claudia. Oh, it's already that late. Claudia's not awake? Maybe the barkeep? Hey, Wessek. How's it going with you? It's really late. Well, I just remembered that I was supposed to deliver a personal message to the High-Richter, and I can't remember where they live. Do you know? Do you know what area of town it would be in? Probably like the Tri-Spires or something. Okay, that was a fun conversation, goodbye. The Pillow Trove is an inn, of course it's open. (yawning) We totally can. I said we totally can do that. I feel like that would be a really big enchantment to put on the the entire thing. I like it. Probably 13. Really? (gasps) What is it that you want, knocking on our door so late at night, Caleb? MARISHA and What is it, Caleb? (cackles) I think he was bragging at you. Good night, Caleb! That is majorly cocked. (groan) And then Oskar falls in love with her! And he carries her across a field, and they love each other so much! It's the most beautiful story, Beau! Yeah. (sultrily) Oh, you're back again already, Caleb. What's wrong? Did you guys get into a fight? Here, Nott. You can read this now. That's the Tusk Love. Not poor folk, rich folk. It doesn't matter, we can't be poor folk in the Tri-Spire. We need to be rich folk that need help from the Richter. Very high middle if not low upper. Like a warm, pink center. Yes! Oh! Yes, how about we have a trading company! How about some of our wares got stolen on the road on the way to Zadash by a group of bandits? I have a forgery kit, you guys! We could change the name of the Baumbauchs to something else. What if we say, "We're from the Timalt Company, they never paid our invoice, and they stole our puppies!" That's how we would know that it was a bad guy. Okay. Yes, and it is very sad. To get all of us through. Who all can make disguises for themselves? You can cover up your face, at least. Why? Blessing of the Trickster! Advantage! No, we don't have to, it's not locked. I try to break the gate, I try to pull the gate! I'm trying to pull it open. Oh, 17! Go, go, go! Keep going! Oh yeah, avoid all the rat balloons! You still have the blessing. Does anybody else need a blessing? Seven. I'm going to cast Disguise Self and I'm going to be tan, short, elven woman in a royal blue lace dress, very similar to the one the lady was wearing, with the cut out. And soft medium hair, pulled back in waves. No, we didn't. I don't think we did. I walk like him. This looks really well fortified. I want to come. (with an accent) I want to come. How about Marge? They don't like cats here in the Tri-Spire. I follow behind him. I like her already. Terrible evil, the Baumbauchs. And they took our puppies. Six. A favor for a favor! Also, what do you think of puppies? Erikson! Every time! Every time! Like the puppy thing wasn't enough? Come on! How dare you, Erickson! With a mustache. And she said that tieflings were terrible. Yeah, but puppies, Nott, puppies. Nott! Yes. She takes bribes. She's a corrupt politician. I guess we have to leave the Tri-Spire then. What time? Just after noon? You didn't get an hour? Before we leave, are there any benches around, just sitting? I want to leave one of the pamphlets for the Traveler sitting on a bench. Minus one. Any guards in the tavern? Does it look like anybody is looking at us, anybody else in the tavern? Ooh! 22. Tonya Fancybottom. Nice to meet you. I'm blue. Would we be all going to this gala together? Oh, so no party. He's pretty stealthy. Do you have healing potions? Just in case we get hurt or something. Thank you. He created them for us. I watch Ulog. I think it sounds fun! Sure, why not. I've never eaten a dog. I feel like I would feel really weird about it. The Fancybottom name is one you can trust! Do you have a good way to get into the Tri-Spire? Okay. I feel like I would've been looking, too, because I was watching for people at the beginning of that. I also have a spell that can make people tell the truth. Or, no, we can just go to the hall of the Hall of Justice. (laughter) The King's Hall? But the Tri-Spire. Yeah. We're going to do all that during the gala?
