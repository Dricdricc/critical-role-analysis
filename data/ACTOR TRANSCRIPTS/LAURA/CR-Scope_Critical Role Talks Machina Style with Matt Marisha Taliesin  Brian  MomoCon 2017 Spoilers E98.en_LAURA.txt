Hi, I'm Laura. Before I ask my question, I just wanted to say thank you to all of you up there, except for Brian. (laughter) I work as a night shift security guard, and you guys fill my nights because I'm way behind. I am way behind on Critical Role, but I'm working on it. I've been sitting at the edge of my seat waiting for Grog to beat that half-orc and crying my eyes out during the Briarwood arcs, getting super excited with Keyleth going through the fire rift. It was just so amazing, and I just wanted to thank you so much for that, because it makes my life better. For my question, it's kind of for all of you, but it's a two-sided question. I'm been DMing my own campaign and I feel like it's stagnating a little bit because I've gotten a little frustrated with my characters, with my players. Matt, what do you do when everybody just either gets wonderful rolls and is just blowing through everything, or makes all the right turns over and over again, even when you want them to go into the wrong way because you want to torture them? Taliesin and Marisha, how do you guys know when you're doing that to Matt? And your dragonborn jumps down a pool that's 600 feet and drowns on the way back up. That's what happens.
