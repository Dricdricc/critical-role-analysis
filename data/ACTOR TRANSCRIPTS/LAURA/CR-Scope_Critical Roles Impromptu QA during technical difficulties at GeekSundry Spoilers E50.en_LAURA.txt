Marisha. A good question. Super good question guys. Do you have questions for me now? Stop it! I just want to look at what's happening! Hello Laura. Can you see me? Can you see me? Or is just like from here on down? Feels pretty good. Feels kind of-- it feels kind of traumatic actually. Just a little bit of pressure. Well I was just worried that when we got to the 50th episode we were all going to die, or, even if one of us dies, like now I feel like we've been together so long, and with you guys for so long, that if one us dies or if all of us die (pause) I don't know, man. It's scary. Okay. My favorite Trinket moment ever? Favorite Trinket moment! Okay, I really like when you guys tied a bunch of bows on him. That was really cute. But I wasn't actually there for most of it. I really liked when he ripped a vampire's head off. Come on. That's a pretty major kill for a bear. What a freaking surprise! We drove home from that session and it was like, Travis couldn't even talk. Both of us were like, "Holy moly! What a freaking night!" Like if he'd have died? What? And none of us even knew? I guess he did die. What is it? Aww, come on back. And me and Liam roll stealth checks all the time. No no no-- I'm scared to give it over-- I was going to hold it for you. How are those wounds? I'm still sore! We did this last week, you guys. Isn't there a bear person class? He's a were-bear. He's a were-bear and he is... I think he'd just be a fighter, a barbarian. Who's the best archer? Ashley. Me. I was not as good. That's only because I started out not great, the one that had the thing for the arrow slot-- So I was on one of these ones that didn't have a thing to say arrow and Liam won. No you didn't. No you didn't! You lie! Good luck on your interview! Oh! You got it?! I remember that from Twitter! Like in real life? My middle name is Dawn. Dawn. D-A-W-N. Yes I have one AC shirt you made me, thank you very much. It's in the laundry right now, actually. We actually are twins. It was uncomfortable. It was a very large creature. Will you be on Tabletop? Seriously? You need to be on Tabletop. Maybe if you were as cool as your sister you'd be on Tabletop. You're on--
