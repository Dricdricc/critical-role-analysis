Very nice, Sam. I know; can you see us? Well, it's the same stuff in merch, but we also have the art book coming out! The one we talked about. Oh look, they're alive! Should have worn the black wig tonight! I'm scared of it. That would be amazing! Wouldn't it?! It's so cool. Make it so. I've got so many d10s in my tray right now. Oh my god. Super meta. Is there anyone around us? Put my hand up and feel. Can we try to push? A ten and a six. That's bad. You succeeded and you failed. Two successes. That's all I could roll. Both of the reds are successes. What did mine do? Do I want to eat the rat-ish? Maybe. Can I catch it and eat it? Just dex? Where's my athletics? I don't have athletics. Yes I do. Shut up. Oh okay. Success, success, success, and two failures. But three successes! No, one is on a red, and one is a success on a red. What? Yeah! I want to bite it like I just ate that donut! Oh no! Okay. It's on the very bottom. Did I just eat a rat? You have a better melee than brawl? Oh my god, what if she does?! What if she eats her own flesh?! Make sure it's a digit you don't use very much. Evil people don't pinky swear! Evil people middle finger swear! You get another red die! I don't even know what it means! It's all so mysterious! That's good! I guess we have to lean into our strengths. How many strengths does he have? I don't think they really like cheese very much. We're just so hungry. Is there any kind of lock? I have it open a crack; I can't feel any? I want to shove it over to the side. Sam? Matt? Dad? Do you see my fingers? Baby! Do you see my fingers? Did Nerdist turn us into vampires? Travis! I start pounding on the wood. Travis! Baby! Baby! Help! There better be a lot of successes in there. Oh! I ate a rat, baby! I ate a rat! Yeah! No! I was really hungry! I'm sorry. Well, there's a little bit of rat left, but it's just the butt. We can't do that! Okay, I'm going to try to open Matt and Marisha. Thanks! I'll try! Three successes, two failures. The success was on the red. Yeah! I'm getting her out first! LAURA and Help me get Matt out. Matt! Look at all your lipstick on your-- What the fuck happened to you?! You look really weird. You should eat a rat. I'm just saying. Can we try to pry open Matt's coffin? I definitely also rolled a bunch of failures with only one success and a failure was on the red. It's a four. Okay. But a failure failure is a one. Oh no, Charlie! Oh, I'm sorry I told you that you look like shit right after everything happened. I didn't think about it. Does it look like familiar handwriting? Stop sticking your fingers in your mouth! Rats have paper? There should be some stunt weapons-- But there's a closet right outside of the stage. Go to the hallway door? I'm going to try and get into the hallway door. Stealthy about it? I'm going to try and be stealthy about opening the door. Quietly. So quietly? Super quietly? I'm going to take a really long time pushing that little bar in. Okay. Whoa! Double zeroes, crit. And all successes. Everything was a success. Yeah! Oh my god. How do I use this, what do I do with this?! Okay. So I can open the door. Can we hear any voices at all? Oh, that's foul. I'm going to go check it out. Yeah, we had Chinese. Yeah. You don't want to check out the server room? Do I have to roll dex stealth? Oh, really? Should I do it? Oh you got two tens, he got two tens as well! A crit is two tens. You mean that door over there? Right. "Where are you," did you hear that?! Creepy! Ugh! Wait a minute, does that mean other people came out of coffins, too? Are they in the stock closet, in the closet that's got the props? I bet Marisha does! Are there Lucky Charms in the cabinet? Can I try to eat some Lucky Charms? Even the marshmallows? (sadly) I love Lucky Charms. These taste like shit. I don't think that's what it is. They taste like shit. Just one? Oh no! Everything else was a success though! She's got two dice. Gross! Do we hear it in the kitchen? Oh shit! I go running to see what the noise is. What the fuck happened to Marisha's face? Those are heavy! Do they look like us, or do they look like--? Signs around their neck? Ugh. Do they smell like Lucky Charms? Ugh. How long were we sleeping? Why were we in the coffins? You were in a coffin, dude, you might have gotten an email. I know, I was picturing a big flesh blob, but it's body parts? Ground up?! Where's Taliesin? There was a hole. Outside? Should we leave? Let's leave. I'm going to walk towards the front door. Yeah, right. Gross. Why are you licking and smelling your fingers? You've got a piece of paper. What is it? Oh shit, you were. Maybe it's like mushroom blood tea. Did we make it to the front door yet? It's definitely a flesh suit. Do you think it's because Matt said we're light sensitive? I can try. Do you want to do it? Sam's going to hold onto my back. You're acting really weird, Matt. Does it hurt? I'm going to squish his halves together and hold him together! You're dead already? (shouting) Marisha's going to be so upset! We're crying. If he was by the server room he totally would've seen it happen. I pick up the Power Ranger helmet. Can we put the ashes in the Power Ranger helmet? To bring his ashes back? What, do you think this is magic? You don't think we're actually fucking vampires right now? I ate a rat! I feel like this is real life! It's not going to go back. Oh no, you drank the tea. It's made of Sean? We come barging in (crying) You guys! (shouting) He's in the Power Rangers helmet! (shouting) I'm going to set Matt's helmet down next to Marisha's mushroom head. Why? We should shut the door. I'm going to shut the office door. Liam's in there still? You guys are so dead! Why did his shoe change? Travis, get out of the fucking room! I'm shutting the door now and I'm grabbing a chair and I'm putting it in the thing to block the office. Dani, this is messed up. Matt and Marisha are dead. Dani, did you eat mushrooms? Thanks. What is this for? This is really weird, you guys. Why? Not the "Drink Me" ones. What about you, Arcade? You can do that? You're not Scanlan, you're a vampire. Sam, be nice to him, he's a really cool guy. I'm going to go over to Arcade and put my hand on his shoulder. Just 1d10? Just one. Ooh. I rolled a three. So close. Arcade looks really good is all. Do you want to come with us? Upstairs, maybe? Are we going to the Twitch set? I don't know. What's happening upstairs? Let's go to the Twitch set. Come on, let's go. It'll be so much fun. Come on. You want to go to the Twitch set? Baby! Look at my teeth! I know! You dicks! Oh, you're hungry! You're getting hungrier! We should get out of this room. We definitely can't leave. Marisha's dead. We don't know where Taliesin is. We would be doing so well if Taliesin was here. He would totally know what to do right now. We got to go to the Twitch stage. Oh yeah, the back area! Let's make our way to the Twitch area. What the heck is happening? I want to know where it's going. Yeah. There's plenty at the side-- I bumped into you! Right. I marked that down. Oh, she gave us a-- A foam sword. No, she gave us the wooden-- TALIESIN and She was being so kind. Stealthily. We don't want to make noise past the meat mass. Hello? No. Through the hallway. I feel like the Nerdist office-- I just feel like it's going to be here. And avoid the server room. I'm sure there's something heavy that I can grab and use as a weapon in the Nerdist office. Is it just perception? Oh god. I rolled a failure. On the red. This is the only one. Did I see anything? Nothing? Yeah, but-- Do you know how you get pink eye? I'm just playing with the Pink Eye system. I'm playing Resident Evil. Yeah. Oh my god! The farmer jumped out! Oh, you guys, have you played this? Oh my god, you guys! I already took it off, dick. And you're in the kitchen. I'm crazy! Hey guys, thanks for leaving me behind in the Nerdist-- Well, your funeral is obviously referring to if you go through the curtain, you're dead. I was born in a box. How do I end? Oh, and it's got-- How do I end? I was born in a box. How do I end? You end from the sun! So I'm going to stand in the sun. SAM and Oh. Maybe the cross, too, a wooden stake situation? Can't you die from a cross if you're a vampire? Aren't we vampires? Look at my teeth! We did! Coffins, dude. No, we were born in a box. Okay. I take the wooden stake and stab the heart on the ground. Should I leave it here or should I back up? What should I do? Should I leave it on the ground or should I-- I'll leave the stake on the ground. Very cohesive. It killed the heart. TRAVIS and Are there any more clues around? Do we see any more writing? Let's see if the key card opens the prop closet. Did it work? (gasps) Is there a weapon in here? Can we look for rats? I need a rat. I want to eat a rat again. It was really good. I'm serious. Three successes for me. Three successes. I'll do a dex brawl. Just one success. Can I share it with Sam, though? I have to eat the rat all myself? Okay, I eat the rat. Just one. I tried, I wanted to but it's such a little rat. (slurps) (gasping) You're going to suck Arcade's blood? You got two fails, yo! He's giving in to it. (gasps) You can't get rid of your other one! I'm looking for a weapon in the prop closet with the rats. What were you going to say, Sam? But we'll also make sure-- We'll make sure Travis is okay. I mean, he's a pretty fast runner. I'm probably the slowest out of all of us. I got two tens. How many stakes? I stick that in my belt like I would at a Ren Faire. Yeah. Did I find a World of Warcraft weapon too? Whoa. Is it made of metal? This is way too heavy for me. Two. Yeah? What was it? Look at this big-ass sword I found! Do you want to switch me? I'll take the dagger and you take the giant sword? Okay. All right. This is really badass. Oh shit. I forgot we were trying to solve a puzzle. Wait, Marisha died by mushrooms. He probably still has some on his skin! Silver! Do we have any silver? Oh shit. I did! I had silver chalice written down. I thought I could drink out of it. Well, you could hit it. Silver is bad for vamp-- does this hurt to hold? Yeah! It's right over in the corner over there, dude! I'm going to go in the back offices. I'll be at the back, all by myself. You want to go to check out the back offices with me? Holy crap! Erika! I'm already in the back office. I don't like it! Oh god. We haven't even seen Ivan yet. He's not feeling it yet. What happens if you get five hungers? I'm going to go back in the back office. I'm going to use my Obfuscate. That's right. So I can be totally sneaky. Okay. What does that mean? I get another blood? Two. I get two extra-- I'm so hungry all of a sudden. Past where we filmed the Slayers' Cake thing. Through to-- I'm looking for writing, any clues I can find. There's nobody in here? Do they smell good? Does Ivan smell good? Whose back is to me as I'm coming around the corner? I'm assuming they don't see me because I'm-- Ivan? Into the back corner? And Ivan seems completely unfazed by it? But everybody else is creeped out? Can I sneak around the room so I'm behind Ivan? Am I going to die? I just do it. Oh wait. No, wits and stealth. Oh, I should have done that earlier! Do I have to use my two news? I do? I have to roll three reds on this? Shut your fucking face! Stealth and wits. Okay, hold on. (counting) Okay, I got to choose my right dice here. Okay, here we go. Oh my god. LIAM and But I got a success! It was already three and just because I did Obfuscate. It seems a little fucked up that I have to use my new hungers on my power! You didn't have to do that! You didn't have to do that! I'm just saying, it's bullshit. Yeah, well-- I'm really fucking hungry. Do they see me yet? Did it seem like Amy was a vampire before she shattered? Can I-- I'm going to walk up behind Damion and bite the shit out of his neck. Okay, I figured. That's what I just rolled, and it was not good. (whispering) I want to suck his blood. A good amount of it. Not all of it. I'm going to leave him twitching. Success. One success. Yeah. He didn't? So I get to suck his blood. At least that's something. Maybe I'm part of Ivan's game. He had a lot of blood. You smell like Taliesin. Where's Taliesin? I get five. Dodge. It's four. One success. SAM and I don't even know what that means! And for each willpower, I reroll a dice? Okay, I'll try it, because you're saying to do it. Two more successes. Strength plus two? (chomping sounds) Ooh. Well, no. No failures, but one success. Well, he's sitting right there. No, I'm good. I'm going to let him live. I'm going to push him forward against the table and back off really quickly. Yeah. So he doesn't lunge at me as I back up. Like he can't walk in the darkness like I'm walking? Whoops. What? Ivan, hi. You too, man. This looked like a pretty crazy game you're playing. Yeah, I remember Paranoia with you. No, you know what? I think I'm good. Do you know what the deal is with that circle out by the Twitch door is? You have? How long has it been? I just thought we're on the same side here. No! It didn't seem like it was possible to win? Travis learned this lesson before. I kind of want to pull a card. I will sit down if you answer a question as I sit down and then I'll pull a card. Okay. I sit down. This is a stupid idea. Marisha sat down and had some tea. She died. I don't know. I wasn't there. I just know that she drank tea and then she turned into a mushroom. How come we were put in coffins and turned into vampires and some people are delicious? Yeah. It seems like it. Right. Yeah. Just waiting for the door to open to the Twitch stage. Well, we're doing pretty good. Pretty good. Looking for clues. I will answer that if you make sure I pull a good card. Beneficial card for me, not for you. Oh shit. I turned into a vampire, you're some weird electric thing! That's fun. (laughter) I know. Yeah, I did yell for him. Travis? About that loud. I know. But I don't know how quiet it is in the building. Travis? I just feel like he's really going to want to pull a card and I don't know if he should. I feel like maybe, if this is a bad thing, then we'll-- this will be just me and then they will never know. Yeah. (yells) Is this one of those magician tricks where you're telling me to pull a certain one and I don't realise it? Oh no, I just got rid of these things! Shit! Ugh. Yeah, dude. It was. How do I solve the-- hmm. What coincides with the picture of the head on the puzzle? Am I still bleeding from my fingertips creepily? All things considered though, this isn't as bad as the spider or the shattering body. I'm holding my hands up so I stop bleeding. I hate paper cuts. Yeah. That we know that we're vampires, basically? I think I'm okay. Ivan. He's made of electricity now. Baby, I pulled a card. Yeah. Okay, but you didn't see what happened with the other cards. There was a giant-- Amy rotated like she was made of glass and then shattered. Like gone. And Sam got eaten by a giant spider. I'm so hungry. Can I get up? You just hid in the bathroom the whole time? What? I can't. I can try. (straining) I can't stand up. I'm so hungry. Sam, you want to come play this card game? I did. I learned something about the thing. Did we see Max yet? That's a long walk. You have a power! Whoa. Max! Come sit down! Yeah. Can I get up? I get up. Oh, okay. Max can pull one, then. Max, what happened? How long has it been? It's been a whole week? Do people in the outside world know what's happening? That's true. You should do it. Yeah, you'll be able to solve it. What'd you get, what'd you get? Three bloods? You have three bloods already? Oh no. You've maxed out your hunger. (gasps) You killed Max. Sam, you killed Max! I'm going to take my dagger and try to stab Ivan while he's distracted with all of that. I'm going to try to stab Ivan! He would have let you die! He wouldn't let you leave! You would have been stuck here forever! Dex plus melee? Melee, not brawl? Oh, really? That's so dumb. I didn't know that's what it meant. Obfuscate. Unseen presence. I could have done it before he realized what I was doing. Cool. What? Strength plus melee? That's definitely why I'm doing it, Sam. Ooh! Three successes and a crit! Well, just one ten. Not technically a crit, but all three were successes. God! That's so many dice. Oh, shit! Well, you just seemed like you were probably kind of mean. I don't know what's going on, Ivan. I'm sorry. Yeah, well, at least maybe, Sam, ask your question. I mean, I'm just saying. The game is still going on. I totally interrupted the game. You know, we should just-- I just try to hold him on to the chair. I'm just going to keep holding on. Yeah, no, I'm trying to let you go, but I'm definitely trying to keep him in the chair. I'm trying to let it-- you're not coming off of it. (whispering) Ask your question, quick. Doesn't he have to take a hunger dice for it? I know, I'm sorry. I'm really bad. You just got to kill someone in order to-- What do you need to know? We found that in order for the head to be unlocked, we have to put something on it that proves we know we're vampires. We don't know that one yet. Does it hurt? It doesn't look like you're in a lot of pain, I can't tell. Yeah. Sorry, Ivan. What are you? What's upstairs? I'm going to pull my dagger out of him, I guess. Okay, yeah! Come in? You got it. Sorry about the stabbing. Ditto, quickly. Did I see anything cool on the bookshelves? I didn't. Four successes! Five successes. Ooh, get that cross! Five. I climb the shelves to get up to it. Take the cross. Smart. He knows all these vampire things because he watches werewolf movies, and vampires attack them. No, he's into it. He's scared of ghosts. What does it have in it? Hey, I bet this is a thing! Skull book. Does it tell me how to be a vampire? Do I learn anything cool about myself? Yeah, I want to peruse it. Wits and linguistics? I shouldn't have said it was cocked! I'm at three hunger. I really need some food. You had to drink all of Max's blood? I'm so hungry. Oh god. I'm down three, so I'm minus one on academics? I'm so hungry. I found a book. I don't know. I'm so hungry. Does it sound like people I could eat? What, like I gave it to you? And the book, I'm going to put on the head. I wander out into the kitchen, looking for somebody to eat. I listen real hard. Do I hear anybody? I forgot I had that. Ooh, that's good. Oh yeah, four successes. I'm going to quietly walk up the stairs. I think it's a rat. I need some food. I don't know where any food is around here. Should we use the book on the other one? Or I could bust out one of my fangs. Are you judging me now? Have you not had any rats yet? You've had a rat. No, of course not. Okay, cool. Yeah, we should try the book. He said it's cerebral. The book is a cerebral thing. See, I feel like I should eat before we go in there. What if there's something bad in there? What, one rat's going to feed us all? Why are you doing this to me? Baby, don't you love me? Thanks, Sam. We walk upstairs quietly, stealthily. I'm not going to use my full Unseen Presence, but I'm going to Obfuscate. Any d10? Six? (whispering) Do they smell good? Wait. (quietly) Hello? Is anybody up here? Hi. I don't know what's going on. I woke up. There's scary things everywhere. Can we hide in here with you? Performance? Shut up. You're a dick. See, there's so much risk every time I'm rolling my hunger dice. I don't like rolling for anything now. God dang it. Five successes. One red fail. But a lot of success. Hi. I crawl under the desk. Are they under separate desks? Oh, this is Sam. I huddle up next to the girl and act like I'm really scared, and I bite her. Damn it. So anyway, you guys work at Smart Girls? And then I bite her. Three successes, one red fail. I'm going to hold her down. Well, I've got three hunger, so a lot. Three. Oh god, I killed someone? Take a hunger dice. Don't tell anyone I killed this chick! Oh man. I feel so much better. This is so dark! Oh no, Travis, are you still hungry? From where? We should get in the Twitch stage. We should go in. Oh my god, Rachel?! Rachel turned into a werewolf! Travis, they are going to kill us! We're vampires! Werewolves hate vampires. You've seen enough of those movies. Yeah, I'm going to run into the Twitch room. You have the best. Three successes. Triple sixes, creepy. Oh no, what'd you do? It's totally Ed and Rachel! Muscle your way through the door. Much better? Don't you have to roll every time you use it? So you risk getting another hunger dice! Where's willpower? Oh, okay, so I have three willpowers. Okay. Success, success. Four successes. Yeah, of course I'm going to make sure you're okay! This doesn't make any sense, but so much sense, at the same time. I will protect you, so you can protect me. Okay? That's how it always is. Liam said I need to protect him, so he can protect me. But the thing is, you're back, so you can protect all of us. We should block the door so that Rachel and Ed can't get in here. Yeah dude! Did you see the tattoos? While they're doing this, I'm going to push one of the heavy things in front of the door. What does that mean? Because he wants to survive, man. We're inside the Twitch stages! We're like, right here. I am going to Obfuscate. Oh, crazy. Are we like out there? How fucking creepy would it be if we walked out? I'm going to stay away from them so that I can be sneaky. I'm going to go, well, there's really only one way around. I'm going to go around this back way, around that other stage so that, when they come up this way-- Oh shit. Oh, god. Like, around the other side of the stage? Like they're hidden? That's cocked, unfortunately. One success. Yeah, I couldn't tell! It sounded like the crew was making creepy noises! Can I look for my dice bag? My giant one that's as big as a head. So I can roll, like, dice on the ground if I need to. Like, it's going to explode if I touch it, or I can take it? Not usually. Is it close by my bag that I need? I'm going to take my bag. I said I took it. Well, I got my dice and I was going to go around, but I can come up this way. You're making sure nobody's going to jump out at you? This set? Oh my god, Taliesin's inside! Are you inside this set? Are you all walking in the set? I'm creeping around the side and stealthily peeking. Six successes. Like, here? I peek my head in right there where he can't see. Outside! Tunnel, I've got a tunnel! There's a tunnel! Good for you, babe.
