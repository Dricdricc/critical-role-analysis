No, he's great. He's here in the studio right now, so you might hear crying. If I get up from the table, it's because I'm going to go feed him. We are at his whim. Thank you! We were with you there in spirit. You guys looked wonderful. You especially, Samuel. I thought he was in the cage! Oh no. Fuck yes! Did my hit points already get updated on my thingie? Sorry, Matthew. I do. I got three last time, though. Hey, wait! That's my job! No, I said I didn't have anything to hold up! We have new shirts! We have new hats! I don't know which camera to look at because it's a little different than before. This one? There's a bumper sticker that says, "The Traveler is My Co-Pilot." There's-- we have The Mighty Nein shirt. I don't know what else is there anymore. We have the bumper sticker, we have the hats, we have the t-shirts, and we have a pin, which is going to come back in the store. It's not in the store just at this moment, but it will be back. And there's other things coming in the store soon, too. Which members? (muffled speech) (gasps) Oh! How did you guys find us? Really? I didn't even get to tell anyone! I tried to. I tried to cast Sending, but my hands are bound. Thank you. Fjord is also tied up, though, really bad. Oh, my muscles would be really sore. This is really hard for me. Somebody else should help him out. Seriously, though, this is really painful, somebody should help him. Do you know how bad it is to have your hands tied behind your back for several days? It's not fun. They knocked her unconscious. You have-- I have healing, though. Don't worry, I have healing. Who are you? I have healing. Yes. I mean, I can heal. I haven't been using any spells-- I can't use anything when your hands are tied. Thank you, Beau. Thank you guys. I go cast Cure Wounds on Yasha. I saw Shak√§ste! No, we saw him in one of the-- I just couldn't tell you! I saw him in one of the other cages. Is that like Pumat Sol? Caduceus. Hi. I like your hair. Thank you. Where's Molly? Is he waiting upstairs? To this dungeon? Because he's waiting upstairs? Was that when we heard you guys? We were in the caravan, we heard you guys fighting. We heard people shouting, I heard you call for Molly. We tried shouting. There's just no way you could hear us. Where did you leave him? Okay. Did you kill everyone here? Lorenzo? What about that short guy that was really mean? She won't know for a while. It always takes them a while to wake up. That elven woman, she would cast something, she would do something to the manacles. They were going to sell us. Whoever would buy us. I liked his hair. I wish I had hair like that. You guys did come to save us, though. Thank you, really. You did! You did have a choice. I would have tried to heal you back. From your butt? What did you pull out of your butt? Oh shit. I mean, you roomed with him the most. But I like really cool things, so, I mean, I will take it if, you know. I was also tiefling, he's a tiefling, we were both really cool. If I ever see anyone wearing Molly's coat-- Lucius. Lucius. Lu-chel. Beau? Thank you. Me and Fjord spent a lot of time together in this cell. Lots of eye contact happening. Just between me and you. Yeah. I noticed him rolling over towards me several times, if you know what I mean. He kept wiggling. You can't really move very much, you wiggle like a little-- Like shoulder to shoulder, like this. But really, we should get Yasha out of here, because she's still unconscious. This is fucked up. Stop joking, you guys, this is serious. Did you-- wait. I know. I was there, I said goodbye to her. I understand how you would think, because I wasn't quite myself, but-- What?! I love that name. Too long. Whispers! Are there other prisoners in this area, too, or is it just us? We were extra special. They're terrible. I bet they have so much stuff! Oh, this is me writing this stuff down now? Well, somebody hijacked all my good pencils when I was gone. That'll make up for what you stole from me! You're not even drunk. Did you reach the bottom? (whispering) Doughnuts. Think of something good to eat. Think of something magical. Think of poop. Think of jewelry. That was close, though. Think of jewelry. I feel like it was. I think of jewelry! Here's the thing. I do know that with my haversack-- where is it, by the way? Who has my haversack? If you cut the haversack, all of its contents spill out. From the outside. If you cut it from the outside, if you pierce it, all of its stuff falls out. No, it's doneskies. You're injured? I didn't even know! Is everybody injured? (whispering) Why was he talking to Yasha? Caleb is slashed across his chest. That worked out really well for us last time. Cure Wounds. Because I'm a healer. I'm a really good one. I know. It's pretty impressive. My bag! Thank you, Caleb! Although, it looks really good with your coat. Thank you. I hold my bag up to Caduceus-- Cad's hair. Does it match? Whoa, it's long! Is it? Can it hold more than mine? Well, then it's expensive. Because mine was very pricey and it holds some stuff. What is that? Whoa! What happened? I mean, I know what happened. Fuck. You can cook? I just start scarfing. You're the leader? Oh, that's wonderful, Caleb. I'm very proud of you. We can all sleep in the same bedroom and you can put your wire thingy in front of it, and then we'll know if anyone tries to break in. What is it? How'd you do that? What is that? What's in there? What was it? Did you pierce it? Is it ruined forever now? Whoa! Those things-- those fucking things! They're evil! Those are really evil! Did the lady ever say anything when she was casting, or was it just touching? (growling) Gross. A special coin? What does the coin look like? This is a galley. Ooh, it even smells good. It smells like home! Is it trapped? You guys, should I open it? Ew, is it blood? Does it look like blood, or-- it looks like somebody spilled their hand in tea or coffee. Should I open it? Okay, I did it already. Ooh! Oh goodness-- whoa, what is this thing? There's a drawing on it. It's a really good drawing. It's like a melon with a cut in it. Many thanks to you-- What is that name? Ionos, I think is what it is. "For dealing with the thieves who appropriated my possession. Reliability like this "will prove profitable for you and your house, should you continue to be. One half of our agreed "payment is enclosed--" (gasp) Is that what the hundred platinum was? One half of it? "With the "other being paid upon recovery of the cloven crystal--" I think that's what this thing is. "It is "imperative that you find this bauble and return it to me. It has great sentimental value to me and my "family. This rendering should suffice to guide the discerning eyes of your hunters." Quen'pillar? Yeah, we know that month. And then he said, "Ah!" when he was writing it, for sure. "Marius LePual at the Wayfarer's Cove." "for the Captain." Evantica! That is-- you guys. Wait... Somebody hired-- Oops! Do you think somebody hired Lorenzo to do this? Or do you think that Lorenzo stole this from somebody-- Do you recognize it, Fjord? It looks kind of like a cantaloupe with a hole in it-- Is that what's in your belly? Wait, wait, wait! We just need to return-- Do you know Evantica?! Have you ever been to the Wayfarer's Cove? I have. I've been there before. Yeah, but he wasn't in Nicodranas with me. Wait wait wait! If we bring you there, we'll get a hundred platinum, you think? Do I have something on me? Would I have a glass bead? It's jade, it's not glass. Sure. Aw, man. I really liked the look of that. No, I can mend it! Caleb. Okay, let's figure this out. No, that was in that thing-- With the fish people. You just spit on this letter. I saw it happen. Did you know, Fjord, that the thing inside of you is called the cloven crystal? Well now we know something. Wait, do I know Marius LePule? It is. We'll solve this. Make sure you don't get your fingerprints all over it! Why not us? Why aren't we-- Would I roll an intelligence check? Damn it. Is this a real coin? No, it's so pretty on the envelope, though. It really does smell like home. No, the Captain-- he has the letter, I can't tell you. LePual. I poke his belly. Do I feel a little hard spot on it? Do I feel it? I rub it. Do I feel a little circle on there? Little globe under the armor there? You should just try throwing it and see if it comes back to you. Ooh! Can we go into it? (shouting) Caleb, can you hear through it? Can we come into it? Yeah! Do I just hit the side of it? How do I get in? Okay. This is so cool! Well, you need pillows in here, Caleb. This is really neat. This is really cool! Can anybody come through, or only your friends? Only people that you like. That means you like me. I like that idea. A lot. Did you just fart? I like it, it's cozy. (devious chuckling) How tall? Who's that? You helped? Thank you. I don't know what would have happened without you guys. Really. I don't know. I feel like I would be really nice to have around the house. People might have kept me around. I drag Yasha's body into the thing with us. You look really scary with it on you. Like you'll be a really good talker? That's what all of us were wearing, dude. What do I say to make them fall asleep? I don't want it. I don't want it at all. (southern accent) That can go in the bag of holding for sure. Or the bottomless bag. It kind of is your thing. Dude, you just swallowed that thing whole. Like totally. Can I look in the haversack? Is my sketchbook still in there? Going to get out my sketchbook and I'm going to leave the little bubble for a little bit and wander out and I see Beau and Keg. I wander a little further away and I sit down with my sketchbook. "Woohoo." I'm going to try to think of what to draw for the last few days to tell The Traveler about, but I don't really know what to draw. Instead I just write "Well, why didn't you come?" And then I close the book. I go back inside after a little bit. "Sory." Did you cast Identify on the ruby thingy at all? Whoa, that bag is way better than my bag. We could always dye that one pink too. You can? You can dye things colors? Oh! We have to finish the thing for The Gentleman, oh my gosh! How much time do we left on that thing? Oh, so you didn't really come to save us. You came to get the money. I know, Nott! I know you did. I was just joking with you. That means you get all of the money. Everybody's so generous here! You can give me all of the platinum, then. I don't mind. What? Is it good tea? Don't tell them it's dead people tea, and then wait until they drink it and then go, "Guess "what that was made from!" No, W.C.? This is the worst. We carry her out to the cart. Can we put the tarp back up and get under the tarp and see if we can see each other? I get up on the cart. Hey! (singing) Can you see me right now? Oh, so nobody's in the cart. Except for Yasha. That is important, yes. We're doing each other's hair, and I'm using my Mending cantrip to fix up Yasha's clothes. Can they see the cart? Can they hear us? Do they look like they can hear us? Nott, moon them. Moon them right now. (laughs loudly) I mean, we laugh very quietly, just in case. Oh no, I rolled really bad on my stealth check. Eight. Yeah! She doesn't want anyone. There's still a horse that has to be ridden. Okay. You can speak to the horses? They're just going to be eaten, though! They're just horses. No. Mamma Mia and Dancing Queen are staying with us. Aw, 21. But still good. Does it look like the guy that we met down in the sewers? Shady deals happening over there. I don't know. They're probably selling drugs to each other. Wait a minute-- (gasps) Wait a minute! Those were those guys! The guys that were-- (gasps) Nott! I just saw one of those guys that had the thing! Don't say that! That's really rude. I saw them. They were over there, they had cloaks on and I saw them! What if they can sense us and they know that we have the thing that they're looking for? I keep looking at them to see if they notice us. I know, that's what I was thinking I can't read lips! Hey, look what I can do. I am going to use-- what is the thing? The Cloak of Shadows? I'm going to use Cloak of Shadows on myself. Wait, that's it? Motherfucker, I thought it gave me a lot more than that. Ah shit, it's in-battle. Hold on, look what I can do! I thought it lasted longer than that. Did you see that I went invisible? I've been thinking about that for a while. Me and Nott are having a dance party in ours. I've never actually been to a grave before. Not of someone I knew. I get down on my knees. I think he's still here with us. Thank you, Molly. I love those cards. Yeah. What did I pull? I pulled this the first time I met him. Well, this is his card. I put it next to the little stick. I'm sorry, Yasha. I put my hand on her shoulder. Are you going to make Molly tea? I need to get myself some diamonds. No, it's so that this doesn't happen again. (softly) Yeah. Wait a minute. How much gold do I-- Where do I add money? Wait a minute, but didn't you guys steal some money from me? I got a lot of tweets about it. Oh my god. "I want some milk," or something. I have many gifts. Yeah, but I do have many gifts, though. Did you get my messages? He has many gifts to offer. You like rings? Whoa! Sorry about that. Hey, yeah, Sam? No, this is my first time looking at it, but I'll tell you what, it sure is... great. My brain isn't working. I was trying to think of a word for-- Can I ask a question, Matthew? Do we know what day it is? Is it past Quen'pillar? (whispering furiously) What are you doing!? So much! They do have milk. I've had it before. (gasp) Oh, you have to try it. It's so good. Or a goat. It could be from a goat. It could be from a mom. Try some milk. That always helps. I'm across the bar just fucking dancing alone. (laughter) Nuh-uh. I don't need any help to dance better! I dance pretty good. I feel like this is reverse psychology. I don't know what I'm supposed to do now! Yes, of course. Well. I mean I had like-- There you go. Nothing happens! Yeah. You know, milk is just so good. Afraid? I'm not afraid of anything! Look at these things! Oh my gosh, Mr. Clay, have you ever had a doughnut? Have you ever had any pastries? (gasps) You know where we should take him? I feel like we should go to the bathhouse. That's where Molly would want us to go. No, no, they would come after Ionos. Lonos. Jonas. I'm not sure. It's a special "I" on there. I can't tell. We should see if he knows the name Evantica. But just say it like-- Yeah, don't make it obvious. It's a casual sort of name. What's an insight check? That's not the name. Go, go, go! (whispering) Can you insight check him? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was insight checking him while Nott was talking to him. No. 12. I feel like his hands moved a little bit more, but I can't tell for sure. There was tension! There was tension in his fist. Right here, I saw. I kind of like it. I think it looks cool. Like this. Well, you know-- Can we make that platinum? Because most of that is platinum. What would that be? Do you remember that tavern called The Leaky Nip?
