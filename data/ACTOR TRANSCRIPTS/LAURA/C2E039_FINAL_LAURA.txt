This is Taliesin. Whoa, my natural one must have been real shit. Oh my gosh, it's happening! I'm so nervous. Like ridiculously nervous. I know nothing. Ever. Ooh. It's a cleric thing. Ooh! You got Yasha's tablet? Fabulous. Shut up. Seven. These people obviously skin other people alive, okay? They're bad people. I like those dice. But she's flanking. She gets advantage on her attacks. Easy kill, oh no! Oh, right. That's true. We'll find out. He's thinking. (fake crying) My sister! Your work was far better than mine. Oh my god, it gets another? Oh, this guy's really hard. Fjord, don't do it. Stop it. (singing) We didn't do it. We didn't have time. How did it shoot through the head and it's still alive? I want to stand up! Then I'm going to cast Hold Person on the gray guy with the cobra head. Oh, shit. Yeah, I need Hold Monster. Okay. That's my action. I don't have any spells for bonus action. Okay, so I say Well shit! That's my move. It's something. You'll find out, won't you? I would like if she tried to run up the ramp and just kept sliding down. (cartoon running sound effects) Uncanny Dodge? (gasps) Can you do that? Cure her before she dies. Oh my gosh! Do you think a lot of gods make people kill themselves? I'm going to search the body of the beast guy. This shit opens up! Ooh, snakes come in and out of here! Did I find anything on that snake guy? Wait! Can I search the cobra head? Aw, I thought it had armor on it! Oh! Try to get some of the poison off its fangs because it's poisonous! Yeah, don't you like doing things with chemicals? I'm going to try to get the poison off of it. Off the fangs. I've got a vial. I haven't milked this kind of-- no, I haven't milked a snake. 15! That'd be smart. A lot, huh? I can do it. Oh, these big giant pieces of wood that we carry around with us all the time? Coins, though? We would make them-- You motherfucker, that was me! What if we get the weapons off the priestesses and put them in the holes? Then you could do that? It would keep them from coming up through it as long as it was blocking, yes? Yeah, so we could shove a sword in there, yeah? This is so fucked up. I'm into it. Oh god. Well, how about I just drag the bodies over. I start dragging the body over and shoving an arm in the hole. I'm pushing them. Yeah. Oh no. 20. Yoink! We should get these of the other ladies. You should put it in the fire and see if it shows words. TRAVIS and We're taking a short rest, remember? So that you can heal. You want me to try to pull it away? Can I try looking at Beau? Check her out and see if I can see what's wrong with her? That's good. 24. Ooh, you're like The Gentleman. Your breathing is more shallow than normal. And Lesser Restoration says it can cure one disease, but it's not that kind of disease? Did you eat it or did you put it up your butt, because it depends. Chewsy chews. Can I take the tip of one of my paintbrushes and stick it in the holes in the ground and swirl it around? Look at that. No, look at the weird algae shit on my paintbrush now. Did I get any poison? You should stick the rubies in those eyeballs! That's how we get out. Good to know. Wait! Can I swirl my paintbrush in the water in the fountain and see if it does anything? It doesn't trigger anything, at least. Let's move the fountain. Put some rubies in some eyeballs. Can we have a refresher on what Jamedi looks like? We only have two rubies. Wait, do you have three rubies? Oh, that makes perfect sense. Rubies are very sticky. It's okay. He already did it. Oh, good call. Cool! Oh, shit, it only grows by the blood. Could you send some light down there, Caleb? Why? Oh, that's terrifying. Wait, let him keep explaining things first. No. That's an eight. What if they eat this fruit and that's how they-- I'm not there. You're not there, either. I jump down, too. Oh god, 14 is like the-- Mm-hmm. That was pretty cool. Tingly how? Oh god. Because you're high as fuck. Nott, are you okay? Do we see any movement in here? It's very shitty. Six. Does this seem like anything we've seen before anywhere, these trees? This fruit? Creepy. They like to get high! Is it roundy or is it rectangular? Can you draw them? What do they say? Should we have been keeping track of which ones were on which wall? Caleb, do you want to eat some fruit and look at the--? Yeah. I give her my sketchbook with ink and stuff so she can draw the runes that she sees. I thought you were trying to say "by people." (singing) You need to eat some fruit. Eat the fruit. You have to eat the fruit. Here. I cut some fruit and stick it on his mouth. Too late, I already put it on his mouth. Too late, he's already getting high! Caleb, Caleb, Caleb! There's another wall. Tell us what the walls say. I go with him. I'm coming! What does it say? That's the east. Let's go to the next one. Go to the 'nother one! Yeah, that's the top thing. The warden guards the false serpent. The false serpent. Let's look for the warden. Oh. You guys are the wardens. You guys are the wardens! Oh no! Get Caleb off the ground! I lift Caleb off the ground because I'm next to Caleb still. Doesn't hit me! I am walking around so the vines don't get me. What didn't cut through? Good point. Did I get to do an action on that last one? No. Okay. I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians. Can I walk over to where Nott is? I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians and anything that enters that space has to make a wisdom saving throw or take 3d8 radiant damage. Wisdom save of 15. This is the vines that are attacking you and if I'm close by anything that's attacking me, too. Okay. 11 points of radiant damage. No, 3d8! Those are 3d6. Hold on. I rolled wrong. Ooh, that's better. 15. No, I'm good. Oh, that's-- 22. Technically-- you suck, vines. Trees and vines. I have no idea what turn is what. --there are little pocket unicorns dancing around. I just wanted you to know. (posh accent) 23. Get her off the ground! Get her off the ground! As I spit on him. Oh, wait, but they should've taken damage on my turn again. On their turn again. (imitating death scream) Thanks a lot Caleb! --yeah yeah yeah! 14 damage! I feel like you got Avantika on your mug. I'm going to cast -- Okay, I'm going to Sacred Flame it. This is radiant damage again! That's five? I say "Put him down!" Just like Yasha, I echo Yasha. Then I radiant damage the vine and then I stomp it with my giant feet, and then I also lift Fjord up onto my other shoulder. Don't worry, little children. You're sitting on my shoulder. Caleb is draped over the shoulder. We need to heal. Heal Nott, heal Nott! How long does it last? (brief exertion) No, I'm sorry-- that you weren't protected earlier. I'm good, thank you for asking. Is he still high? Are you still high? Are either of you still high? Spiritual unicorns are dancing around you guys as this is going on. They're like this big! Can I try reaching with my hands and pulling? No, I'm still big! No, I'm not still big. (humming) No. 12. Like a lever, like a switch, or anything. Same. I'm going to take some and put it in my bag again. Where were you? I wander over and see if there was a dead body in the other one. Whoa, did you see that? That was crazy. 13. What does the body look like? Anything in the satchel? Did it look like-- like no way I could tell if she took anything from the satchel? She took something from the satchel. I stomp back to the rest of the group. (laughter) Go, Beau! You're so cool! You should lead it! Me. Yes? Beau, I'm going to give you Blessing of the Trickster right in front of you. 15. This is where the warden lives. (whispered) Has it been more than ten minutes since the fight? (whispered) Okay, just checking. (whispered) I feel like we should spring an attack on him. (normal voice) I feel like we should spring an attack on him. We do. Fluffernutter. I'm pulling out the little keg of black powder that Nott stole from the pirate ship. Fluffernutter. We're whispering all of this very quietly. We could Fireball it. (whispered) Another person could be invisible. (whispered) I could have the keg. Yeah, or I could be invisible, go in, and touch him and cast Inflict Wounds. It does a lot of damage if it hits. It's 5d10, and it's heavy! I could Invoke Duplicity in there and then Inflict Wounds with my duplicate. She can't carry anything. I'll duplicate in and Inflict Wounds. I can make my duplicate silent. Yeah, it's a duplicate. It's not going to touch anything, really. It's a hologram, it's an illusion. We already did it today. Okay. At the same time? Yeah, so that he doesn't see it coming. Let's do it. Okay. Would I know if when I cast my duplicate, does it make a sound? It's not a loser! It's really cool. Or go around it, it doesn't have to go across the water. Does it look like it's got its eyes closed? 19. Okay. Okay, I'm going to Invoke Duplicity. Okay. She can move up to 120 feet, so she's going to float silently and be on-- yeah, behind it so it doesn't see it. Yes. Okay. Then I'm going to cue Nott and at the same time I'm going to Inflict Wounds. 3rd-level. You can shoot them at the same time. One, two, three, go! At advantage? Okay, wait, got to look at my spell. Okay, that's good.16 plus seven is-- 16 plus seven is 23? 38. 38. Times two. 38 times two. Well, isn't it because it's a sneak attack? Oh, I'm thinking-- sorry. Critical hit. You're right, sorry. 38 points. Yeah, right. Oh! Stop. (giggles). Ey! Oh no! At me? But I could've hidden or something. That's my armor class. Oh, good. It misses me. Does that reach the creature? We won't see anything into it, though, because it's just black. Wow! Oh! Thank you, Caduceus. Nine! (music) Yes. I was watching when he walked around the pillar, so I saw where he went. I'm going to send my duplicate backwards a few steps and hold out her hand and hope that she touches him. Yeah. Yeah. At 3rd-level. Ah, fuck me. It doesn't hit. Nine. Man, sucks. Okay. That's fine. They're really pretty, right? Oh, and I'm going to move around the corner so that he can't fucking shoot arrows at me. Yeah. Shit. We haven't gotten to the False Serpent yet, this is the Warden! We couldn't even kill the stupid little snake guy, how are we going to kill a hydra?! So stupid. We didn't even see the heads come out, we just see the heads pop out of this bubble of blackness. Can you flank it? Travis, your face was just like-- That's the most amazing face you just made. It landed three. It got five attacks. Yeah. Is Yasha raging? Oh! No way, you can actually pop off a head! I like it! It needs burning damage or else it's (popping).. Okay. I'm going to move my duplicate outside of the tentacles, close to the shitty guy that I was fighting before. Oh, I have to keep a visual. It is the case. I didn't think about the fact when it was in there that I don't have visual on it. I would have lost it before I ever cast that other spell. Oh jesus. I don't know if works like that. Okay, then-- Oh, can I move around the corner? Then see it? I can't move it at all? Great, cool. That was an awesome-- Yeah, it happens. I can't move my duplicate out of the darkness. Can I move it over to Beau? Can I see that area, over next to Beau? Yeah. Or just like in front of the well? Okay, well at least it's out. I guess right now I'll just do, jesus christ, Guiding Bolt at 1st-level on the hydra. 16? 12 points of radiant and then next attack gets advantage on it. Then I move out-- I move back. Oh yeah! Advantage, she gets advantage on the next hit. One attack. Should I do it? Should I do it? Nott told me to do this. Fluffernutter! I throw it. But I throw it high. Towards the heads. Shut up! Don't curse it! 11. We're almost in sync here. That didn't go as well as I had hoped. (shouting) Fluffernutter! For my bonus action, I'm going to move my duplicate out and stand next to Avantika. She can't really do anything because I used my action. She's just going to stare at Avantika. I'm going to hide around the corner and for my move, the rest of my movement. Whoa. Now we have to burn the head with the-- aww, it would've been so great if we would've succeeded. We have to burn the heads. We could do it like Hercules and just keep making it reproduce! Yeah, it's wet. The keg is wet. That's true. I know. 22. Did you double the Hex dice, too? I know, but all I have is radiant flame. That doesn't quite-- it's not the same. It does. Yasha want to go first? I'm going to-- jeez, you're really hurt, aren't you, Beau? It just seems like a waste. I feel like I should take out at least the other guy to lessen to the damage coming in. What is the wisdom thing that you did? The hydra or the-- MARISHA and I'm going to Sacred Flame the other guy. Okay. Oh no, that was a dex save. It doesn't matter. I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm trying to get this guy out. Okay. I guess. That's all I can fucking do. Tight. Shoot up-- kill the monster guy. Because he can kill Beau-- he can do double damage right now to her if he hits her. Do it. Kill the guy. Yes, he is. He's right next to Beau. He can kill her. Kill her kill her. (cooing) Kill him! A lot. Yeah, go, take it. Plus five. Up the butt! I know, he's going to get a hit on us. I'm going to go down if I heal Beau, so I'm going to heal Beau and hope that somebody takes care of him before he kills us. I'm going to use my duplicate to reach down and touch Beau. Can I see my duplicate? Well, I'm already within range of him. Can I see? Okay, I'm going to reach down and use Cure Wounds at level one because that's what I've got. With touch, yes. Ten points of healing. That's all I've got. I don't have anything to do for bonus, outside of Spiritual Weapon. Okay, okay! I've got something. Can I bring my duplicate up next to me? For my bonus action. It is, he gets a negative-- he gets disadvantage on attack rolls against me when my duplicate's next to me. That's a lie. I get on advantage on attacks, they don't have disadvantage on me. Holy shit. Was it? I mean, Beau would have definitely died.
