No! There's officially 30 sets left, according to-- 30 sets. There are 30 sets left in the store, we will be ordering more. So there will be more, but I don't know when that's, you know, going to come in. So 30 sets for the time being. Good job, guys that got them! You Critters! There is a bear in it! Yeah, she said her name! I wrote it down. I also wrote down "chain devils know." I don't know what that note meant. About the Bastion of Flesh, is that what it was? It was just, chain devils know, period. That, too. Oh god! That quickly, huh? 24. What'd you roll? No, you go. There's no other entrance. We really should have gone up and looked at it up close before. Kill him! I was just thinking because it's at the same time, technically our moves. Could I send Trinket in? Well, that way Trinket's next to him so that my brother gets better-- doesn't he get better-- I think so, yeah. Could he get there? Oh god, that is so scary! I don't know, now that I'm saying it, if that's the way to go. Here's my question. While he's figuring out his shit, if Trinket falls and I don't see him, does he still come into Raven's Slumber if it's within 100 feet? Or do I have to have visual? (gasps) Matthew Mercer! Then he's going to do that so that you have a better attack on him. Motherfuck. Whatever. Just keep saying that! I'm going to back up next to Tova. Wait, who's the big guy? What's that big thing? Is that Doty? Okay, I'm going to get closer to Doty, and I'm going to hold my attack until I have visual. And then I'm going to have Trinket attack him, since I don't have visual on him right now, as my bonus move. So he's just going to get one attack. You said I can get my attacks and then have Trinket be my bonus action, because he can do one attack as my bonus action. Single attack on bonus for bestial fury. All right. He's going to just be in there, roaring. Get them, Trink! He's going to roll a 21. Yay! Whoa! That's a 15! Well, he's a really magically charismatic masseuse-- Does it do any damage? I attack. Okay. Two against-- I want to do Bramble Shot as my first attack. Okay. Oh! 30. Okay. So I get Sneak Attack because Trinket's next to him! Okay. 4d8. Seven plus ten is 17. 17 just for that brambleness. And then he has to roll a strength saving throw of DC 17. Okay. 15. 17 plus three is 20. Three lightning damage of that and then Sneak Attack is another six. So that's the first attack. Second attack! What was that? 21. All right! What's five plus eight? Is that 13? 13. 15 with two lightning damage. 16, 17. Am I allowed to move back at all, or duck under the window? Well, I probably can't hide; isn't that a bonus action? So if I just move out of the way. Okay. Towards Doty. Okay. I'm not next to the window anymore. (sing) Come inside. And only magical weapons can damage them, or they have resist on non-magical weapons? Based on my lack of Trinket attack fullness. I'd like to think one of your antlers caught, and you're like, (yelps). Yeah, it was good! What color is pit fiend blood? (gasps) Percival! I'm standing in the corner looking at him like, (whispers) what are you fucking doing? That. Was. Sick. He did another gesture? What gesture? What did he do? Oh no, people are watching. What about Trinket? Trinket's got a really good sense of smell. Wait, with his keen sense of smell-- Okay. 17 plus-- what does he add to it? Anything? Oh, wow! 17 plus nine. 26! Yes! Yes! Ah, I love this! Don't fuck me Gil. Oh, Gil. Did he get an advantage, though, because he sniffed out people? Damn it. Nine. 29? Did you already ask if the pit fiend took damage because you took damage? Just singeing. We can see through the fire. Natural 20! How are we going to get him out of those flames, man? Don't you have spells? You have so many spells! Okay. So I'm going to come up in front of the window. Great. Can I Hunter's Mark the pit fiend? That's fine. I know where he was, right? Trinket is facing him, so can I try to shoot him with an arrow, anyway? I have Sharpshooter, I don't know if that helps at all. Okay, let's try this out. Those are being aggressive. The lower of the two rolls was 29. Okay. I know, right? Those fire-proof arrows. Great. If I shot an arrow from a Blazing Bowstring so it was already a fire arrow, you think it would go through? Okay, I'm going to do that. 19. Well, it could have been cool. Okay. Trinket is going to use his bonus action to try to attack him, even though he's not magical and he's a little piece of shit. That is a 26. Yeah, go Trinket. Yeah, that's good, too! That's a 15. Yeah. And I'm going to tell Trinket, back the fuck out of the fire, Trinket! What are you doing? Stop attacking! Get out of the fire! Yeah. And then I'm going to back away from the window. I'm going to back away from the window. Just into the corner, like where the angle of the wall is. Yeah, right there. And I'm going to back away from the window to where he doesn't have visual on me. Yeah. Of course. Come on, Trink! TRAVIS, NOELLE, AND It almost was really good, but it wasn't. Six! You did that to an animal! You're evil. Make it better. I like how the music stopped while we figure this out. Balls! Do you add anything to it? Tary, it's your only friend! Oh my god. Can you use Luck? Use Luck. That's molten blood, he said. Eat it, Utugash! Do you get advantage because he's prone? What if you jump on him? You could jump on him! Did you take something? How much damage did he just do with one turn? Not to the other corner where there's probably-- No! What's your AC? Oh no, he's pulling things out! Are you alive, Tary? If I pop through the window, will I be able to get out of the window? I want to pop through the window, get Trinket in the locket; that's what I'm going to do first. Go, Buddy! I'm going to hop back through the window. Can I let him back out of the locket from there, or-- That's my whole fucking turn? Fall over and be unconscious, is what Doty would do. Matt, can I use my bonus action to at least Hide? 23. Didn't you roll an eight? You seriously need to stop using that one. What is a Blood Maladict? (Grog voice) I have advantage. Ooh, that's good. TRAVIS and That's your whole action? Oh! Can you imagine if you had been attacking the pit fiend? It is really hard to see some of these people. Oh my god! Oh no, Tary! What are you doing concentration on? Oh, right. But, wait, what did the next melee attack do to you? 20 points. Okay. Hey, I can see him now. I don't know what all I could see of that other than just the pit fiend's arm through the window, but I'm going to back up and shoot him. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him first, though! And I'm going to-- yeah, that's what I'm going to do. Through the window? Yeah, sure, whatever. Great. (sighs) I hate you. Hunter's Mark! Well, you know. The first one is a one. (grunts in pain) All right. That's fine. I'm going to hit him again, though, or try. That is-- I can add-- 23. Yes. Okay. Yes! 18 plus one lightning damage, plus 2d6, here we go, and two ones! I'm rolling great! Woo! All of these. All of you guys are goodbyes. And you're a goodbye, too. You can stay. Huh? How much was that? Oh. 19 total. One of those was lightning damage. I'm going to back up. I can use the rest of my movement, right? And back up around that corner so I'm parallel with Percy there. Yeah, right there. I just have a quick question. Since I I haven't used this very much. The Disengage feat that the rogues have, is that a bonus action? Okay. Just checking. Oh, it was those fucks. A fire giant? Are you attached to him? That made up for all the rest of the times he fucked us during this game. Just say it. I want to hear you say it. That die's so much better. 19. I'm going to run over to Percy and give him a kiss and say, nice shooting, stud, and I'm going to help him look. I shout through the window, loot the body! And I keep looking in the things with Percy. (sings) Yeah! Putting that in the stash. 12,300, you said? I shoot an arrow into it. 21. 18. He should've listened. You were very clear, dear. Some spicy meatball. I'm going to pop Trinket out of the necklace and cast Cure Wounds on him. Wait, they're in the prison? Wait, does the Bastion of Flesh sound familiar? As she's saying this, Trinket goes and grabs some of the rotting meat out of one of those and brings it to her as a present. Are you still a bear? Would you know your way around if you went back to the prison? I mean, do you think you'd know your way through the halls? Terrible idea. No, I don't know what you're talking about, Tary. Yeah, maybe we should get out of here. But being very careful for traps because they are present here. What are you fucking doing? Ew, what is that? This is definitely what we talked about. Yeah, of course. I don't know. I get Trinket back in the necklace really fast. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself really fast. Why? (high-pitched) We surrender. This is a good plan! Good plan! No! This is the part where C-3PO is being pulled apart. No! Killer! 31. I breathe a little easier. Gross. Great. Can't wait. You fall unconscious. That's a break of contract. All right. I saw this movie! (laughter) Oh shit I missed the last thing that he said. I got all the directions, but I didn't hear the very last thing that he said. Door with a grin? Wait I got right, left, straight, straight, left, straight, right. No. I want to try to lockpick, too. Not the one in my mouth. Okay, how about this. I'm going to pop Trinket out of the necklace-- I grab the necklace and I go, Trinket, get out. Trinket! Get us out of here! Hey, okay, here's the thing. Can you go over and get anything out from between those two bars, on the outside of the room? Did you get that?! Okay, back away. Maybe you can try and just break through these manacles. Can you do that? Okay. Okay. Okay. 17? I want to pull my leg at the same time and see if I can help him out at all. Should've had him do this to Grog. Okay. (laughs) I suck at strength checks. Okay. 15. Great, I have an ankle free. Hey, guys! Guess what? My ankle's free. I am really flexible. This does nothing. Yeah, Keyleth, what can you do? What the fuck, Keyleth? Can you do that to all of us? Yeah, just get the lockpicks. Do you have any extra? You can pass them to me and I can maybe help. Just fucking let me out of this. I want to go over and start trying to do the lockpick. Oh, actually, I don't have any lockpicks on me, still, do I? Yeah, thanks. He gives me a spare and I start trying to work on the door while he's doing the others. Out the doors, so I can get our shit. What do I add to it? 27? Jesus. Wait, not yet. It's quieter to do this. Just, come over, and-- Yeah, it's really, really tough. I could have done the chains on all of us, and you could have done this, but whatever. You're going through my bones. Twins. Now you've got to. But quiet. Try to do it quietly. Just quiet. Just quiet. Motherfucking door. No, no, no! He's been doing everybody. That's a six, that's a 1d6. Hey! Great! I reach through and try to grab everything in, pass it out. Okay. I cast-- I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. Nope! I think it would be best if maybe we, I mean, I don't know how well we can stealth around here, if we should maybe turn into insects and just crawl around here. I think we should do that. But I've definitely got a Pass Without a Trace still on us. Solid. Copy on that. But maybe those little insects are immune to the fire since they live here. Wait, we can't be those little-- Oh, really? Not insects. Maybe hummingbirds, something, the teensiest bird you can think of. We can't be insects, we can only be animals. Yeah, so teeny teeny teeny, like, finches or hummingbirds. Ooh, bats, down here? Whatever, as long as we're flying, maybe we can be stealthy. We'll be stealhty bats. So we can just shift in and out whenever we want? With an action? Okay, I think getting-- yeah, we should, it's easier to not get caught. And then we'll stealth as bats. Sure. I think we'll just-- there's a lot of demons around here. Devils. Yeah, you don't speak the shit, so even if you have it-- Stealthy bats. We fly close to the ceiling and be as quiet as possible. I'm solid with the bat, but I'm going to lead the way since I'm good with directions. Oh, but we can still see where we're going. Is it echolocation only? Okay. Right. Flying close to the ceiling, stealthy. Okay. Fly with purpose, fly with purpose. As soon as we get to a thing, we turn left. At least they're letting us go right now. Left. Oh! Wait, no, we haven't gone left yet. Yes, and now we're going to turn left. Plus ten! I'm going to say Trinket's back in the necklace, by the way. Okay. No, that was me, I did that. 34. Just keep flying! Let's go through them. Avoiding the bars! Avoiding the bars. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Let's just keep going. Straight! Wait, only a right and left? But we have two straights in a row! Keep going straight. Keep going straight! Can we batter into it, or can we just fly straight through? Tary's got wings coming out of his head. Yeah.LAURA,  Left!, TRAVIS, TRAVIS Chaos. Chaos. Yeah, I poop. Oh god. Oh. Yeah. Straight! Fly zig zag! Fly zig zag! Fuck. Yeah. No, it's a bat's AC. Oh dear lord. Yeah, we did get pretty far. Wow. Eight. Oh! Can Keyleth just-- Wait, what was your initiative order? What was your number? Fuck. As long as you just stay out of the way and don't break your concentration, you can keep turning us in and out? Okay. Don't get hit. Tricky, tricky. If we can, we're going to peace out. We're all bats again. I wink as a bat like I totally understand her. Well, would she move? She's got to wait until Vax gets out of there, now he's surrounded and he's a bat. I want to lead everybody away down to the right, but I've got to make sure that my brother gets away from these thugs before that happens, so I'm going to hold my movement until-- can I-- I'm going to hold my dash action, then, until I see that he's safe. Or at least he's away from them, so we can get going. Bats disengage. Okay, I see him, and we have everybody now. I take off to the right. Yeah. It was the last thing, it was to the right was the final turn. Right? I know! Why did he say it like that, like it was-- But everything else was-- I'm going to the right. That's the last intersection that I know. Toodles. As much as we can be, toodles. Who is that? Is that Keyleth? Oh, it is? No, but Percy's off the map! Fucking balls. This is not good planning. Solid. Everybody's far away from her except for me and-- who's the other person? Oh no, did I disappear? Oh, because I was in a corner. That's okay, that's pretty hot. Can you put a little marker on me so I can see it? I can't see the erinyes. Okay. Thank you. Oh god. Oh my god, if she dies, we're fucked I'm up! I run forward and I slide on my knees and put my hand on her and cast Cure Wounds at 4th level. On Keyleth. 27 points. That's my action. Yeah. I'm going to pop Trinket out, as my bonus. Behind-- sure, whatever. Yeah. And that was my full movement and everything, wasn't it? Bad News Bears. No, not if you give it to somebody else. Do you have any spells? Like a Bless or anything? Bring everything in to use so you can just (poosh) to them. How did this happen? How did we get here? Nice! That's the first time you've helped another person, right? That's what I said. Yes, kill it so we can run away. Oh, he's still alive? Keyleth, can you do a Wall of Stone? Yeah, block it! Okay, we should put Dust of Tracelessness down. Dust of Tracelessness on the ground! Fanged smile. Do we have anything to freeze? If we can freeze him in place, maybe. He's made of metal. 24. Can I run to the other doors that Vax has been looking at? Huh? The far one in the back. Yeah. And I'll look for the symbol. 23. And I'm looking for a fanged grin? That totally could be a fanged grin. Okay. The very back door. Yeah. Is it possible to bonus hide? Nothing to obscure the view? Okay, then I'm going to use my bonus to pop Trinket out. I guess he was already out, wasn't he? Because we were running. That's a waste of bonus. (laughs) No, I'm going to Hunter's Mark. So Trinket was out. I'm going to Hunter's Mark the guy. What about symbols? Do you see anything? But is it a fanged grin? A fanged grin is usually cocked. But it looks more-- (laughs) "I turn into a bear?" Don't fucking die, Keyleth. If you can do it to everybody, why not? And Grog. Can you transform anymore or are you spent? Sanctuary. No. Oh, because he failed? Does it break through the door? Get it, Grog. Ooh, perfect. Because why not. A million. Now we just have to Plane Shift. Is it done? Get to Keyleth. We have to be touching her. Does he? And the minute you take damage, you become visible again? All right. I'm going to run forward and try to get to-- I'm going to poof Trinket in and run forward and try to get to Keyleth. Yeah. Oh my god. I'm so confused. I feel very nostalgic for some reason as she's doing this. This is very comfortable for me. Oh god. Am I on the ground again? Did you put me down? Okay. I mean, I'm not opposed, but. He's really going to just try to kill us before we can get out of here. If we make a chain, we can reach over to him. Yeah! You. Heal yourself. Just heal your-fucking-self. That's Vax. He can dash. He's not raging. Tary and Grog can hold hands in that position, right? He can reach Tary and Percy? Yeah, so can he reach his hand out and have Percy and Tary? Okay. Oh yeah, he's super tall. Can he reach farther because he's super tall? Please, please, please. Please, just let him get there! We've just got one teeny little gap here, and whose turn is it? That's me? Fill the hole. Oh, not you. Holy shit. Holy crap. That was a really fun episode. That was a really fun game. I feel like that was the most fun that we've had in a while. I'm so tired! Good times.
