Right now! So wait, we're unboxing last month's box. What did you do, Marisha? You can put your soup in it! Did anybody show off the shirt, yet? That's pretty frickin' cool. Wait, what size do I have? Hey, who's got a small? I got a large. My favorite thing is the Batman head. Thanks, Lootcrate! What's up! The dice are out of stock, you guys. You're always a little kooky, Marisha. Oh my god. Lego Batman head's gonna be my dice jail tonight. That's an important announcement. A friendly prisoner. We're friendly taking a prisoner. Nicely taking a prisoner. Kraken, plural? I feel like we should-- We should have a Heroes' Feast before tomorrow. I have no idea what a kraken does, or-- How large are these lodestones that we're looking for? Great. Lots and lots of snorkels. Keyleth, I know you have the ability to turn us into different things. Is it possible to turn us into water elementals? It's not a thing. Narwhals! Merfolk? What if we want to be a mermaid, though? Okay, sweet. And a seashell bra. Ooh, I like it. Oh, Trinket! Okay. Yeah, but a midnight feast like-- No, 'cause that would waste a spell on the day. Makes sense. I don't know how my bow's going to work underwater. Practice for an hour, have a midnight feast. Right. So fight first, and then snack. No, no, no, no, no, yes. We're doing that, but we're leaving in the morning. Yeah. Can we still breathe on land? Yeah? Ooh. Sleep in a fishbowl. Can we see under the water? How's our perc-- Visibility? What about Percy with his glasses? I mean, could we do some sort of goggle things, so we can see better? So that we could see underwater. Oh. I don't know if there's time for all of that. It'd be great, though. Tary, you're really good at crafting, right? All right, could you make something like that in like an hour? Yeah, I'm going to try to shoot an arrow and see what happens. Does it-- It doesn't seem like it pierces any? So what would that be? Uh-huh. Oh no! Thank you, Ryan. So, for a longbow. Ooh! Let's be sharks. Or we could be merpeople. How do I find out how far a longbow can shoot? Okay. Done, okay. Yeah but, oh. Wait, you can shoot into water. He's a real bear, Tary, he's a real bear. Hm. He's still formulating it. Through a portal, into-- A little yellow fish. A little yellow fish that's very friendly. I have a little poison bolt. Do you want one? I've just been holding onto it. If you have a crossbow? 50,000 gold. Hm, I'll take it. I was just gonna gift it to you, but I'll take the gold. I do still want an Alter Self coin. See, that's pretty great. That's cool. Yeah, all of this conversation has been happening underwater. We're surfacing and talking and going back under. Are they? Yeah, but what if the kraken sees it? Yeah? Let me make sure Pass Without A Trace is not concentration. We have to be animals that can grab things. Run! Distract him. Only attack if truly necessary. It's true. Half of us are animals, half of us are riders. The thing is, the kraken might be able to swallow you whole, Grog. I don't know how big they are. No, but they've got-- Don't they have beaks, like a squid? Yeah, yeah. I'm out. No, we were treading water. Oh, no! Is there some sort of Alter Self spell that-- Yeah, no, yeah, you're right. Aw. I like how SeaWorld is was what was our line. Of tactless. Is there an Alter Self sort of spell that could make you be able to speak underwater? Is there anything that you can do that allows for speech? What about merpeople? How do they talk to each other? Are there really merpeople? There are merpeople. It's Water Breathing, it's the spell Water Breathing. What if we use some sort of-- -- cap, right? On Grog's jug. And it just makes air! (laughs) Okay, okay, okay. Whales and riders. I guess I'll be a whale. Or Trinket could be a whale! I will ride Trinket. Can't we have two people on one whale? I feel like whales are very large. But like ice cream, and donuts, like a midnight snack kind of. Like, waffles and-- Yes. Mm-hm. Mm-hm! Yay! Lovely. All right. Oh, maybe we could do it in the morning? We'll find out. If this is going to make us be able to fucking talk underwater-- (gasps) Talk, Grog! That's awesome! What a waste of (sings) fucking time! Yeah. It does. Oh. So we have to be super quiet. (gasps) This is awesome! What a fucking idiot. We don't have giant domes on our heads. Oh. Oh yeah, that's smart. Oh. Alter Self? Maybe you should be a whale. Is there any burlap around? What if I stitch up the front? I just would hate for it to open up. I'm just gonna-- do you mind? If I just-- I'm really good at sewing. Yeah, I stitch up the front. It'll be like a choir robe for you. Yeah, that was smart. Fun, fun, fun! I start working on the robe. Really ugly stitches. You're welcome, darling. (gasps) (all laugh) Oh, shit! Oh yeah-- Yeah. I'm gonna brush Trinket. You need it! You're dirty! (all laugh) Yeah. Just gross. I want to spend the morning, before anyone else gets up, standing on the edge of the water and like letting my toes sink deeper and deeper as the waves-- That's fucking sick! Ah! Nice. Yeah. Trinket's gonna be a whale. If he hits zero, okay, I have a question. If he hits zero hit points-- Does he go into the-- Would revert, and then-- Okay. It would have to be 150 points of damage. Thereabouts, 160. I mean, I can just use Water Breathing and cast Pass Without a Trace on us, that's the only thing, is I can't do that if I have Alter Self. If what? Okay. Oh, good. All right. You're a rider? I mean, I can swim. What if you give me the coin-- -- and if things get hairy, then I use it, and then we drop Pass Without a Trace. I'm not gonna be an animal. We're fine! Yeah, so I'll get a coin, I'll cast it, go in, if things get bad, I'll use the coin. The old Alaskan pipeline. That's true. Yeah, you can call us by anything, we'll both respond. I follow suit. (gasps) That's awesome. I think so. This is where we're gonna check out the lodestones, before we go through the door. No, no, no, wait, how long does it last? No, 'cause we can do it underwater, can't we? Well, let's wait until we're going into the water plane before we turn into fucking whales. He's coming? Tary, shouldn't we leave him? Just lots of water. What if he gets rusty? It might be smart to not have him join us. Just leave him behind. What does their hair look like? I just stare at her. Are they all the same color? Every lodestone looks the same? Not translucent at all, not-- Okay. I do have Locate Object. Nice. Yes. Locate Object is concentration, and so is Pass Without a Trace. It's within 1000 feet. Yes. Yes. Are we ready? Have you seen a kraken? And? How big, are we talking? Big enough to swallow him? All right. Let's. Run. Right. Kraken! Is it beautiful? Aw, it's so cool! I'm going to take a moment to use Primal Awareness and see-- is there a way to sense krakens? Or anything. I don't know, do I? Aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends and undead. And krakens. Krakens-- Yes. Elementals, aberrations-- -- and fiends. Oh, I have to choose one What do you think? What do you think? Aberrations or-- what do you think a kraken is? What would a kraken be? Aberration? No? All right, then I'm going to try for elementals. They're like everywhere. I have a feeling light will attract all sorts of creatures down here Hm. Hm, what about those kind of fish that have the-- -- things that dangle in front of their faces? He's covered. I'm going to use a Locate Object spell Yes. No no no, it finds similar objects. Awesome. There is a lodestone within a thousand feet that direction. Oh, that is smart. She can cast it on an object and leave it behind. You could-- -- cast it on the tip of an arrow and I can shoot it at least 150 feet. Let's try to move stealthily, for a little while. Or should I just drop it and cast Pass Without A Trace right now? Oh good call. All right. (with hesitation) Okay. (all laugh) I hadn't imagined him in but-- Yeah, he's going to turn into an animal so-- Let's bring Trinket out. Fuck it! Yeah. So he can fucking swim. Well. What if-- Okay. It's fun, buddy? Oh god. No, no, no. I'm gonna cast, I'm gonna-- Fuck. I'm gonna cast Speak With Animals on him. Trinket? Oh, she's casting Pass Without A Trace. I'm casting Speak With Animals. Trinket, everything's fine! You're just underwater. It is. We're going to be swimming for a while. You're gonna make me cry, dear. We're going to be swimming for a little while, all right? Do you feel okay with this? He can breathe, just breathe in. Just like land, only not. Yeah. We're good? Are you all right? All right. Just giving you a heads up; you may be turned into a whale in a little bit. You'll be really, really big and you'll be able to swim a lot better. All right? Just remember to follow my lead. And I'm gonna hang onto you when you are a whale, all right? Okay. I love you. I trust you, too. I love you. I'm proud of you. I love him so much. I love him! Shut up! It's fun, see? It's fun. But paddle quietly, dear, we're trying to be stealthy! Okay. I love him. Aw. Okay, okay, okay. Oh, with Pass Without A Trace, right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I don't know what to add for Trinket's stealth. Is that just his dex maybe? Okay, so 29 for me. And 30 for Trinket. 18. Let me make sure I'm right on mine. Yes, I am. Oh. Concentration? It's not. No. Okay. Mm-hm. Can I look around? Does it seem like it's right there? Okay. 25. Can I move some of the sand out of the way on the ground and see if I see anything? Ten. Yeah, bust out that compass. I'm gonna wander to the other side of the wall and see if it's on the other side. To the other side of the wall, yeah. Ah, that makes sense. Do I see it now? (high-pitched) Nine. We're digging softly, we're trying not to do that. Shh, shh, shh! We move over there to start digging. I think we found one! Do you think they'll know, if we grab it, do you think it's going to attract anything? Grog. Can you swim over here? We lift it, and put it in the Bag of Holding. Hey, one down! Do I sense another one with my Locate Object spell? All right. All right. Shall we hide, yeah, curve around so we can hide from the big figure up top. Woo. Yeah, plus ten. 39. Going around. We're trying to keep as, you know, stealthy as possible. Do we sense any kind of movement around us or anything? Twenty... two. 21. No, we got goggles. I mean, do they? Can we start looking for the lodestone? 18. Can I use the compass? Well, can I just use the compass? I wanna take it and bring it down to the ground and like-- Like a metal detector Oh god, oh god. I feel like something's bad. Man. Why is it so tense? That's good. 26 for Trinket. And the compass. Yes it is. Again? Fuck! We go around the fucking rock. I don't know, Grog. So you don't have to cast again. Yes. 19. 19. Oh no. Shh! Put that dice away, put that dice away right now! Tary! You're fucking us, Tary! Did I find it while it was happening? 19. Jeez! Maybe we can shoot Daylight directly into his eyeball. In his eyes, maybe. He's not used to bright light. Or directly at him. 19. The Groggy-poo. Whoa, he's really pretty in that light, though. We would've been a bunch of whales slamming into shit. I'm going-- Oh no. Oh, god. (laughs) "I meant Petco". Use Luck, Tary. (laughs) 18 damage. I already forgot what I rolled, 'cause everybody's talking numbers. 14! You got it! Oh, shit... He doesn't make it. MARISHA and The Alter Self coin, does that take an action or is that-- Fuck, okay. Then I'm going to start with pulling out the arrow and doing what Keyleth and I talked about. Hey! I'm pulling out my arrow. And I'm gonna shoot it-- As close as I can to the Kraken's head and just, like, past him. I want it to go by the eyeball. I mean, if I can get it in its head-- If I can hit it in its head, that's cool, but-- What is happening to your watch? His watch is telling him he's working out. Oh, I know! It said-- Okay. Come on! LAURA and Come on, come on. 26. (high-pitched) Okay. Well, all right! (deep voice) 12 plus (normal voice) one lightning damage. This is not a Sneak Attack and I obviously can't have done Hunter's Mark. I want it to be by its eye. Well, now there's shadows. Ooh, that'd be great. Oh, yeah. I can't do a spell for my second? I can't do Alter Self on my second? I was just checking. Okay, do I still get disadvantage if I attack it again? Okay, I'm gonna attack it again. Okay, I'm gonna attack it again. What's 15 plus seven? 22. 12 plus... just one damn lightning damage. (Southern accent) One damn lightning damage there. Right, 'cause lightning-- it just did lightning. Obviously it's immune to lightning. Right. And I'm gonna use my motion to back the fuck off and try to get behind that rock outcropping. Laser pointer. Okay, yeah, sure. Just on the other side of it. Okay, cool. Okay. Yeah, can he back up behind that pillar? Yeah. Oh, did I get a bonus action, I guess I could've-- Can I hide for my bonus action as rogue? Yeah, I'll do that. You're next to Tary, though, you can put it in his. I didn't roll after I said I hid. Okay. Oh, that's good, that's good, 35. Aw, he saw me? 35 is not good enough to hide from him! Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, that's-- Oh, that's right, you hate fish! Oh god. Oh god, oh god. This is bad. Aw. Who? Magic is hard, guys. Does he gots two eyes or just the one eyes? Got it. Wait, which direction? Yeah. No, your wisdom. Oh no! He's so strong! Oh no! It's the Dread Emperor all over again! I get 19 points. Natural 20! Just kidding, he gets it, too. (all laugh) (gasp) Oh yeah, he can grapple like all of us! (Southern accent) He's got enough of those tentacles. (all laugh) Me. (Southern accent) It's showing? Oh no. (still Southern) No that's mom. Fucking A. I gotta use the Alter Self, so I can actually do something, though. I won't be able to get to anybody, I'm just going to waste a turn. Oh, am I still doing it? (extra posh) I'm using Alter Self. Okay, I'm gonna swim behind the rock-- god damn it, light-- laser, no! The other rock, sorry. Yeah, but on the other side of it. And I'm gonna-- And I'm gonna use my bonus action to hide again. Oh! No no no, I used Alter Self. Bonus action to hide. And you cast a spell so we can't use Pass Without a Trace Anymore? So that's 24. Yeah, you did. All of us wiggling. Oh my god. How do you break free of being restrained? Are you punching it? That's good, that's good, that's good. Maybe we can just rip open its guts and then leave it. He's grappled. Ooh! No, that's something. (gasps) Oh, you can keep up Vampiric Touch if you want. I'm on the other side of the rock but I can hear you. (gasps) Oh my god, can you get the water away from the kraken and maybe it'll just be on, like, landlocked? Right, right. (gasps) (laughs) That was, like, such a grandma reaction. "Ooh!" You. No. Right. Ah! I bet it looks really cool with the daylight passing through it, though, huh? Awesome. "I can't, I have to keep my feet on the ground!" That's me. Oh, creepy. Really creepy. I am going to-- Matt's like. -- swim up and over towards my brother. Towards where she was pointing the lodestone. That's with the altered self? Okay. I'm gonna have Trinket-- wow, okay. Awesome. I'm gonna have Trinket, for my bonus action, swim up on top of the kraken's back. And try to claw through, because he saw Grog get swallowed. He's just claws, like, thinking he's going to get to the belly. He's going to attack him with a claw attack. Damn it, that was a good one. Oh! 25. For creamer! Did you say creamer? Oh, okay. Five plus eight is... 13! And I guess I still have an action, because I can't get close enough to search for the lodestone? So I'm gonna try the thing that I saw very noisy Keyleth try earlier, which is to shoot out Grasping Vine and try to break someone free with it. Grasping Vine-- oh. Oh. Okay! Then I'm gonna cast Conjure Animals and I'm gonna try to cast-- that's third level. I get summoned fey creatures, so what's a fey creature that swims underwater? To what? Oh, CR. I have my card, wait-- What is a rating one? Is that super lame? Rating two is still super lame? Two. Yes. I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Matthew! I'm sorry! It can be-- you know what? It can be an animal. I'm conjuring an animal. I can conjure an animal. I'm gonna conjure a shark. I've seen a shark. Why does it have to be a fey creature? I'm conjuring an animal. It's considered fey. It says, 'Each beast is considered fey.' You can summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts. Okay. I cast a shark. Right around the kraken. I want it swimming around the kraken to distract it. And it's gonna attack him. Roll what? 11. It's more for distraction purpose anyway. It will be, if it uses up a fucking tentacle. Hey. That hits. How close am I? How close am I? How close am I? Halved. Because of his armor. Everybody's grappled! It's just a tentacle, it's not-- What if you turned us into animals now? Will that break the grapple? Krakens suck. Oh god. Oh my god, is it like being in lava? Gulp. Oh no! What about my shark? Does it get an attack of opportunity? I get advantage, right, on it? Okay. 16 plus six is 22. Oh. 14 for Trinket. Do I roll for the damage? Of the shark? 13. (gasps) You can do something from the inside. Aw. Yeah, this one's crazy. Ew. Like, if you swallow cod liver oil, you vomit? Yeah? Oh no. At least it's still retrievable. Can you use a bonus to help anyone? Nine tentacles? Or it might just swallow all of us. And then we just Planeshift from the inside of the kraken, and everything's okey-dokey. But we all have to be holding hands. No, that's what he just said, there's no water. Yeah. He's going to shoot out some watery lodestones. Plus bless! Oh! Oh my gosh. If you knock yourself unconscious with your own fireball? Wow. No! It could kill the jug! That's good. Oh shit. Mother fuck. Slowest math. 16 for me. And 14 for Trinket, so-- He is ten points. Fuck. Okay. I'm gonna keep moving towards the lodestone and my brother. So can I use my-- can I get it out of the water and put in my bag of colding? I have a bag of colding. Yeah. Okay-- We're all going to die, but we have three lodestones doing it. And I guess for-- god. For my bonus action, can I-- I don't know what to do. I'm going to have-- while I'm thinking about this, I'm going to have the shark attack him. The shark's gonna bite the tentacle that's holding onto-- who's that right in front of him, Percy? No. He's going to swim towards Percy. And bite the tentacle to help free Percy. And he gets advantage? 15? Is that enough? Okay. I look at my brother and say, can you get out of this? Okay. I swim back and use my bonus action to try to hide. Yeah. Towards the rock, towards the-- Yeah. Well, I try to hide-- Yeah. Can I sit on the ground? I wanna sit on the ground and wrap my cloak around me and make myself look like a rock. Hey! Oh really? Well then, if I can't hide from him, can I use my bonus action to do something else? Then I'm going to have Trinket attack him. He'll attack the tentacle that's holding Tary. Oh, Trinket-- Trinket's grappled! Trinket's going to attack the tentacle that's holding him. Oh two 19s, and that's a critical for Trinket! That's ten! Did he get out? Damn it. Is the kraken an animal? Was Trinket within range for a (chomps). Only if you're grappled. Yeah. 29. 29. But you're grappled. You want some more d4s? Okay. Yeah! Eyeball death! Yeah, we're just trying to get away. Whoa. Yeah! Oh, what a clutch fucking vestige. Would have been great if Scanlan were here just to like Dominate Creature. Don't get swallowed. Get us out of here! And we slip out of its grasp. (laughs) He loves looking up animals. I don't wanna be a giant constrictor snake. We wanna be teeny ones, or little ones. So make us killer whales. Yeah, that! What are you reading, what are you reading, Marisha? It still can hold us. Then I think snake is probably better to wiggle out, that's the thing. He's going to be able to hold whales maybe. I don't know. I don't know! I don't know. It's your Aramente. And we all just book it. We're all just gonna bamf back to-- but at least, hey, we're ungrappled. Oh! What are we doing? Ah. Yeah? As an eel, I'm gonna swim around the big brown rock, away from the kraken, towards the door. Yes. I feel like I'm just leaving everybody behind-- oh, and Trinket's gonna do the same thing. Can he use his double action to do the same thing? Just kidding. But I am gonna make my shark attack him! The shark's gonna just swim up in his face. Swim up in his eyeball, and just be like, wah, look at me, I'm-- I'm a shark! 21. Yes! Okay, that's a bite attack, that is-- Okay, wait-- oh, that's more than that! Anyway. 12. Aw. Ooh, yeah! I wink at him, with my eel eye. Well, you're an eel. But wait, no, it's-- is it an eel's-- -- attributes. Plus, you're an eel. It's a 10 AC. Fuck. Yeah. 'Cause it was 10 hit-- Yeah. He's got like no hit points as an eel. Eight. Eight. MARISHA and Shit. And then I went, then Percy went. Fuck. Me and Percy. Ooh, that's good. It's okay, it's okay. Yeah, how many tentacles are we-- Oh, right. Is Beast Shape concentration? Oh! That's a natural 20! Yes you do. You have a coin! But that's good to know. Still? Yeah. Wow. That's a major healing spell. You've attacked him with acid since. Ah, jeez! Don't kill it. Don't kill it. Yes, we do. All the lodestones. No, not anymore. No, not anymore. They got-- Oh. No. Oh. Yeah, and Tary. Why are you trying to yank him towards you? You are directly under the Kraken. Oh, yeah, that could be smart. Since-- so you don't go unconscious again. You're right under the kraken! Just wake her up? Adrenaline. 23. But only ten for Trinket. All right. Does he-- I mean, 18 is what I rolled, I don't know what I add for it. I mean, do I see any of this happening as I'm just fucking swimming away? I guess my-- Fuck. I'm gonna swim up so I can see down over the rock. Okay. I'm gonna try to shoot an arrow into the tentacle holding my brother. Oh. Disadvantage, right? Same thing. 25? 15, 16, 17. 17 damage, with four lightning, which I'm sure does nothing. Sweet. And then I'm gonna-- do I have any movement to swim back down and hide? As my bonus? Oh, miss it. 22. And then I'm gonna have my shark attack him. Yeah. Plus nine-- 17 plus nine is 26! Good shark. Good shark. Good shark. With a bite attack-- Sweet. 14. I'm just using Trinket's stats, 'cause that's what I had in front of me. Is that terrible? I'm sorry. Okay. Oh, and Trinket's gonna swim towards the door. It's your AC. It's just your AC. Fuck, he has a lot of tentacles. And you're out! One's out! One's out! It already happened. No, no, no! He doesn't swallow you! But grappled. I'm gonna throw up. What if you-- Is this the ultimate fight of like-- Yes! Ugh. (gasps) you're unconscious inside of him? Natural 20. Wow. Fuck. We shouldn't have attacked it so much. He's a defeatist, if I've ever seen it. Yeah. Yes. Yes. You used Beast Form on that. You used Beast Form to turn into a whale. Yeah. You're pointing at the TV screen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 23. Well, Vax is inside of the kraken. So you're at zero. You're at zero. I rolled a 20. Yeah. Okay, and Trinket rolled a-- like a four. Cool. I saw-- And I saw Vax get swallowed? Did I see that happen? I-- fuckin' A. I swim up, and I swim-- god damn it. I'm gonna try to shoot thorns, I guess, Hail of Thorns, maybe? Actually, I'm gonna try-- yeah. I'm gonna try-- -- to shoot Hail of Thorns at-- directly at his mouth. I don't know, try to get him to like, do something to let go. Spit it up. It's the stupidest plan. I know. But, I'm not thinking clearly, my brother's got fucking swallowed. I'm gonna do it at-- Oh, everything within five feet, and Keyleth is in five feet. Okay. Is anything within five feet? Okay. Then I'm gonna-- I'm gonna cast it at fourth level. Yeah. Oh no, I did Grasping Vine. Did I? No, I didn't. No, I did Conjure Animals. So fourth level. 23? Yeah. 11 plus three lightning and then-- how many? 4d10? 18. Yeah, I guess I'm gonna try to shoot at his eye. 29. 16, plus four lightning, nothing. And I'm gonna-- This is so stupid. I'm gonna swim back down and try to hide. I've got nothing. Yes, I did. I'm gonna stand right there and say, fuck you, let go of my brother. Oh yeah, this is gonna be-- (make impact noises) Good, then you can get Vax out. (laughs) The kraken. (groans) So that's 48 hit points healed! Yeah, I want it to go and try and attack the tentacle that is holding Tary. 21? No, 22. 14. Trinket runs-- -- oh yeah, and Trinket ran towards the door I don't know about that, it might keep them from getting digested (gasps) Well, still better than nothing. Oh my god. Maybe. (groans) Would it be like a patch healing spell? 19 for me. And-- fail, like five. Six? He's unconscious, so he's bamfed to my necklace. Is he within a hundred feet? Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm gonna swim to her and try to cast Cure Wounds. Good, I'm casting it at third level. So that's 3d8. That's cocked. That sucks. Seven, sorry. Seven. Save my brother! (garbled) Save my brother. I'm gonna try to hide. I'm gonna just swim away from-- I'm just gonna try to swim towards the fucking door, but try to keep my distance from kraken while I'm doing it. Oh, shark is going to attack one of the last tentacles, if it can get to it. 28. 12. The shark has been pretty great. And it's so late. And we're just into the wee hours of the morning, watching ourselves die. But he only has two tentacles left. The shark's been hurting it. And Keyleth just is barely-- That's great. (sings) My honest husband. Don't. (groans) You better fucking heal him. No, he's unconscious. Grog can't do anything. (gasps) Look at that, look at that poison bolt. (gasps) You're tugging-- Dexterity! Nobody else is grappled right now. Hashtag so not blessed. Unconscious. Tary-- Motherfuck. You took me! (gasps) Oh, fuck. Oh he's-- LAURA & He does have the third lodestone! Oh, that was a great way to ensure that you got out of here, Tary. (all laugh) What just happened? He said nitwit, throw the nitwit through the door. Can he throw Tary through? Or is that an additional action? It's a Red Bull. Lair actions. Oh my god. Oh my god. I think it's going to try to swallow him. Right through the door! Vomits him right through the door! Oh my god. That was so much worse than I ever thought it would be. I feel like I'm going to throw up. Everybody but Vax. Yeah! I was watching him take it down, and I was like, oh my god, one more hit and Grog's unconscious! You would have been swallowed, too. Oh, I feel so sick! So, that's good.
