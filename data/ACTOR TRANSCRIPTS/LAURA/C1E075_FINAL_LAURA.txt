No, you're not the sound effects. "Hi, folks! Handsome Sam Riegel here. Only thing more handsome than me is this here Loot "Crate, featuring X-X-X." "Once you enjoy the geeky gear inside, you can use the box to clean up, well, all this dust!" Yeah, that was good sound effects. Oh! He's so cute! (whispering) Whaska. (louder) Mm-hmm. Oh, no. The Chuckle Palace? (whispers) I'm sorry. Oh, 15. Well, it does. Oh, no, he's so weird. I can hear you moving around me. Blends in with the sulfur; I don't care. Wait, were they walking on two feet or--? Oh, I just wanted to whisper Vax? Can you pick these locks as we're walking? Do it then. Subtly. Oh, God. He's making shit up as he's walking. I guess we have to ask, like, hey do you have any cool collections? Do you play cards? Have you won a lot? Stuff like that. Well, aren't we going to try and steal it once we see it? Or are we really going to try and purchase it? Or maybe if we see that he has it then we can challenge him to a game of cards? That he can't fit into because he's huge and it's for normal people. I do! Oh yeah! Okay! I use it. Oh, do I have to stop? I can't do it as we're walking? As he's talking I start doing it. (laughter) Okay. And that lasts for ten minutes? Senokir, how large is the forge? No! That's all right. Funnel them. Yeah. Right. Has he seen a suit of armor-- I don't know. Does Senokir think that that would be bad? Senokir, where are you from originally? That's true. I was just curious; you're so interesting. I guess he's the size of the zombie giants we fought. Don't fuck it up. Whaska. Ask Senokir what he means. Oh no! Don't you have a lot of fucking weapons in your Bag of Holding? That's not bad. Greatsword of Frenzy! Oh, that's right, the helmet. Yeah, but it's hideous. And they said they didn't do it very well. Do you want to try this Greatsword of Frenzy? Doesn't matter, it's too cool! You make mayonnaise out of that all the time! He doesn't want jewelry, he wants arms! Yeah, but it's not weapons. I mean, we do have dragon scales. We do have a fuck-ton of dragon scales. Just let it go. Get it out of the bag of holding. Give him, like, 40 pounds of white dragonhide. Right? Can we do it like that? But it's better if it's one big piece, as opposed to a bunch of tiny little pieces. You're so strong, Pike. Get it! Sexiest fire giant I ever did see. (imitates Senokir) Great. We will. What? What are you talking about? Senokir, what is that place? Big enough for a giant to live in? Maybe describe it? I feel like the more we make it seem like it's valuable to us, the more they're going to ask in return. So maybe make it seem less valuable? She could think it's a fucking trinket. It could be like nothing. It could be like a candlestick. Scanlan will. So I'd have to cast it again. I only have one more level two spell because I don't have very many spells. Do it now, because it's 1,000 feet. No, it's definitely on the first floor. That's what it is. It's on the first floor, up high. He just said there were windows on the second floor. Eww, you could take a swim in it! (disgusted noises) Oh shit, you can see him? You mean a dick? Do you know how to open this door? Yeah, no shit. Oh, it lifts! You could have made any of us look like not-- I want to look around immediately, all the walls. 29. Yeah. She already took it, though. I'm looking at the walls at around 20 to 25 feet. Do I see it, up high on the ceiling? Because I've been looking. You're going to be blinging out; we got to get it! Should we let just Keyleth and Senokir up on the chairs? Can I roll an insight check on the whole allies thing? I was having difficulty choosing. 19? Oh no, you can't read still. (dry heaves) I knew that's where she was going to go with this. Do we need to all sit on the table, then? Thank god! Do you suck at it? What's the goal? What are you trying to get to? So it's just numbers, at this point? There's no way to cheat. There's no way we can cheat! Because the ante's already on the table! Right, there's no way to cheat? Unless you can fudge the dice! It's technically cards. There's no way to fucking sleight of hand this shit, is there? Maybe, can you pray for Sarenrae? Oh no. Oh, hopefully she didn't roll an eight on that first one. We have to be ready to fight. Grab it and then Jenga out. Maybe it's a one. Maybe we can perform for her? Did you ever meet a dragon named Thordak? Fuck. Big red guy? Took a lot of fire giants with him? This one was special. He had an enormous jewel in his chest. (groaning) Ah jeez. Does that mean we don't have to answer to you anymore? You're equal to us? Actually, madam, master. Do you have any symbols that you can give us, like something we could show people so they don't try to claim us for themselves? Because we're a lot smaller than everyone else here. Something that shows that we're your slaves? Is she out of the room? And two other giants are behind us? What are they doing? All of us except for-- Jump up and fucking see how it's attached to the wall! Thank you. They're lovely. We'll do you the favor, Senokir, of carrying this chain back to your place. A favor for a favor. (giggles) Ooh, his eyebrows literally going up when you said that. I think he wants to do it. Saving throw. Four. Oh no, Pike, but you're already so little! Grog, pick her up, she looks like she needs some water. Yeah let's sleep in the mansion till we can at least get rid of this heat. As long as we know that Allura will send us a message if something goes wrong. Why doesn't anyone go outside at night? Bless you, Senokir. Yeah. Okay. Different chains than regular chains? Okay. What are we at? Hmm? Yeah. We've got so much water. Yeah, but he's got a jug full of it. She could be gnarlier than the giants that we've fought. The pit fiend? Run in, grab the armor, Plane Shift out. Can they chase us down if we do that? No, it's instant. Remember, we checked it. Yeah, that's pretty smart. I mean, I'm down, I think that's a great plan, Grog. Yes. Oh, shit. Can you scry on the pit fiend? And you know like a thing for him, right? We know his name. Does he have any, like, cuts on him, anything that looks weak? So we'll have to wait until he comes out. How tall is he? He could duck in. If we said, "Hey, I heard there's really good slaves up in this mansion--" Yeah, but I don't think the slaves attack the owners very often. He could be much more intelligent than Yenk was, though. He meditates? Is that the hot one? In the morning. Not now. The mansion door is rather creepy, isn't it? Yeah, can't you make the mansion look like anything you want? I mean, if it looks like a sexy den or something. Ultimately, if we can get him in a building and then back out of the building, great. But if we can get him in that building, why can't we get him in the fucking mansion? One of us. That would be bad. What if you and I dressed in exact, identical clothing, and then we're unique? We're, you know, twin slaves? Although you can only grow us or shrink us by a foot, so this would be a really little-- Wait. If we can convince them that he's broken a law of some sort-- TRAVIS and What's against the law here? He's the one in the big-- no. Yeah, let's not do that. No, let's not. Senokir, if you saw a bunch of people who looked the same, that went from small to big, wouldn't you want them as slaves? They were totally hot, too. Oh, really? What's the most unique one you've ever seen? Wings! You have wings! Yeah, but they could probably see through that shit! His are real! I feel like they'd be able to tell. But whatever. We don't have that much money. Plan A, into plan B if it doesn't work! What is the sultan's name? I almost got it memorized though. They hung a bunch of fabric up and lit some candles? So we can put pieces of fabric up. Juuraiel? Whatever you want to look like. Like maybe an imp! Something little. What is that? Awesome! Be one of those! That is awesome! Oh, that's so kind of you! But we have beds that are specific to us, and we-- No, nobody should! You can do it, Grog! Roll a natural 20! In the mansion. Not in the studio. (laughter) And Vex. I mean, yeah, but one's got boobs. Which one? (laughter) (shouting) This is awesome. No. No, make us look like good slaves. No, I want to look pretty. Make us clean, like pretty slaves. Oh yeah, make his wings, when they come out, like white wings. They only last for an hour. No. Why? It's just clothes, though. No, we're saying we're not making his wings look like that yet, dude. Oh. Senokir? Hi, where are The Arches? It's voodoo shit. Wait, Uten. So what happens? Are these all for sale then and--? Okay, and then other people come through. So, if you like do the door thing here then this could potentially be a market. Convincing enough? I mean, we'll set up shop and only sell to him. Yeah, but people will see the gazebo appear out of nowhere. Yeah, but we need the mansion door to get him inside so we're not going to have us outside. Are we? Oh, I understand. I thought you said Hallucinatory Terrain? Let's just fucking stand here. What if we danced? Yeah, set up there. Then Grog, you lift him up and make him look super tall and we're doing this around him. In a row, doing the same move. We'll look as we're voguing. Do you want to give us instruments and we'll all play something? Aw, can we get them? Go get them. Go get them and see if we can get them. Maybe and then we can set them free once we're out of here. Yeah, I'll go over there. Oh! (fake sobs) Yeah, talk to the guy and I'll talk to the slaves. (whispering) Offer him 15 for the pair. Yeah, we are going to buy them. We are buying them! They're so young! They're innocents. Do you speak Common? How did he find you? It matters, dear. Ugh. (retching) Come stand over with us. Do we have the mansion up? Yeah, I guess so. No, no, no, sorry. I'm sorry. No! No, no, no, we got an amazing deal. Like, 50 gold. It was so affordable. With my gold. Yikes, no, I don't win. Don't talk to me right now. Just don't. (laughter) No, also not attractive. Don't! Stop. (laughter) Aw, man! That is so sad. Scanlan should be visible at all times. You be careful with them. He's not even here. No, I bet he's in the fucking Nine Hells right now. Yeah, he's probably sold all the people that were hanging out with him last time. Can I come out and bow before Scanlan and say, "Forgive me, master, for interrupting, but "the female aasimar is fighting back." I know she is much more powerful than the boys, but we cannot control her. All of it, my master! All of the magic! I rolled a 28. While I'm outside, I say Could I offer you some refreshments, great master? (small voice) Okay. It's too late! Because he's outside, dude! I'm out there with him. So is Vax. I don't want him to hurt them. What does that do? Can you make yourself step out-- no, I said there was a female. So I'm not saying anything. I'm sorry. No! Fuck. I get ready. The minute, well, never mind. Oh god. Natural one, natural one. I release Trinket from my crystal necklace. Are there any of the efreeti guards around? We took too long. Aw, fuck. We're doomed.
