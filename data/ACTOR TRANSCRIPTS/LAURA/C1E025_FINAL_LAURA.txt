He's got a hashtag thing going. Right. Now. So #BattleChasers, too, that's an awesome thing. NBC. At I think ten our time? Oh, is that what you've got? Basically, just burp a lot. Does somebody have an extra pencil? All I have is this broken one from Grog. It's hiding your face. They're at the door? We left them at the door? And Percy, your weapons are still on you because you already had an illusion on you, right? Right? I mean, they are hot, right? So at least there's that. No. That's good! 18, he said. Oh my god. It wasn't a one. He's pulling up his spells. I start running towards the door to grab weapons. And I'm saying into my ear, where are you? What's going on? I guess running towards the Briarwoods' room. As I'm running towards the Briarwoods' room, I start shouting Uriel! and grab a servant and say, go find Uriel. Tell him there's enemies within the gates, in the castle. Now! Seeker! Start rolling different dice! But we know he's in the room. That's where we're all heading. Can I use Hunter's Mark and sense where Lady Briarwood is at that moment? I take off running in that direction. I hadn't rolled, actually, for that. I hadn't rolled initiative yet. 18. Can I use my earring during that? I tell Keyleth and Tiberius that I think they are outside the palace walls. Yeah, you do. Can I ask a question? Trinket. I didn't say I left him at home. Did he wait outside of the palace during the formal dinner? But he would have stayed outside at the palace, right? Seeker Awesome? Seeker's turn and Sylas got to take a turn! Right as I get outside-- I would whistle, but Vex can whistle, and she whistles for Trinket. No, but I whistle for him. He knows to listen for it. Yes. I scream. Can I attack? Okay, if I did something that did five feet-- ten feet... I've got to look at this. Yeah, ten feet. If I hit Lady Briarwood, would that hit my brother, or would that just hit Bastard Briarwood? Fuck it, I'm doing it. Lightning Arrow right at her face. Well, that's wedged. Natural 20! What do I do, times two? So it was 32 damage on her, and then everybody within ten feet has to make a dex save. Not him. He's not in it. And I Hunter's Marked her. Fuck. One. Oh, good. Then 2d8 for them. Nine, and then times two because it was critical? 18. And I get another attack, though. Yes? Okay, then I'm going to attack her through my Blazing Bowstring. Natural 20 again! (cheering) Yes, of course it is! Okay, eight plus seven is 15 plus two for bracers, so that's 17 times two is 34. Plus Hunter's Mark damage, which is another fucking six! 38 damage. No! No, it is 40 damage. She's on fire! I should say what the Blazing Bowstring does, huh? An additional d10 of damage for that. Would that have been part of the part that was multiplied by two? Another six for that. Yeah, fuck that dress! Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay, cool. 15. No, wait. 17. Then maybe you don't want to go first. You can wait. Yeah, because you used it when we were fighting that manta ray. Servant. Yay! Our friend is in mortal danger right now, you maybe wouldn't want to hit on somebody, at that moment. She cast it at Vax. You're back, baby. There you go. Dimension Door! All right. I'm going to-- Okay, yeah, I'm going to take a healing potion. A superior, which is what? That's so many fours. 20. Oh, 28. That's good. And then I'm going to cast-- I'm sorry, Hunter's Mark. I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns right at the one in the middle. They're right next to each other, right? Let's stick it to Lady Briarwood again. Cool. Balls. Oh wait, do I, I don't need to roll to hit on that, right? Oh wait, that's wrong. Oh, the next time I hit a creature. Oh, so I don't think I hit her. That was 15. Okay, then I try it again. I didn't hit her again! It's because you're safe now, buddy. Where's Trinket? Okay, did he hear? I whistle again. Yeah. Of course they do. Hate them! Magic resistance. Wait, how many times does he get that damn thing? Did someone ever get Uriel? Yes. Knowing that they seem to be vampires because they've fucking creepy teeth, I'm going to pull out one of my holy arrows and shoot it at-- Lord Briarwood's in the way of Lady Briarwood now, isn't he? Well I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on him. And then I'm going to shoot my holy arrow through my Blazing Bowstring one more time. Come on! Hold on! 28. Okay, good. Do I do any additional damage with my holy arrow? Oh wait. 15, 19. Plus ten for the Blazing Bowstring, so 22, and then what did you say? Seven more, so 29 damage. Awesome. Then I'm going to hit him again! (laughs) So yes, I'm going to do the same thing! Except I'm out of my Blazing Bowstring; it fizzled out. Okay that's a 29 to hit. Okay. That's good. Plus two radiant damage. Yeah. 17. 28. And then another d6 for my Hunter's Mark. 32! Yes. They fucking disappeared? TALIESIN and I do have Hunter's Mark on him. They're right there! Do we want to keep fighting them? They're around the corner. They're right there. Is Trinket anywhere near them? Can I shoot my exploding arrow? 19. 29. It's against her. What do I do damage for the exploding arrow? That Percy made, by the way. 16. Okay I'm rolling one of our Critical Role dice. Damn it. 11. You're not dead! Hopefully, you won't turn into a vampire. You did get bit. Yeah, put him in our cell. But make sure he doesn't bleed out first. What's up? What's good? Vampires! Are you hurt? Did they do anything to you? You were unconscious. I search him and look for any mark. I turn and look. You. You helped us. Interesting taste in enemies. Do you know anything about vampires? Laboratory. Then you'll come with us? Yes. It's wonderfully interesting Keyleth, but we need to get my brother to a cleric. What was that? Can you come with us to a temple? How did you know about us? Oh my gosh, Zahra! She's so wonderful. I love her so much! Yes. Any watcher that comes after you we'll fight them. We're very strong right now and full of health. Your guests are vampires. Look at my brother right now. Look at his neck. You invited vampires into your palace. It's all right darling. It's all right. I hold onto your mighty mane, and then him as well. I hop down off of Keyleth. (laughter) I thought she was disguised. We'll pay whatever cost you need. No. Sir, anything. Oh, done. You're clean; don't worry. He was bitten by something quite unholy. They drank his blood. Well, any vampirism is a little unnatural. Thank you so much. She's in Vasselheim, restoring another temple of Sarenrae at this moment. She has. They're opening a shop in here-- just kidding. There's a shop here! Sleep calls to us as well, sir. Thank you for opening your doors. That's loud. That hurt. We'll hunt them down. We need to set alarms around our keep. I hope you've learned your lesson. Quite so stupid and reckless-- Jenga. Where's Trinket? Your uncle almost died! I almost died. Did you know I almost died, darling? That's a six. You deserved that. Yes. You're guarded against scrying in your room? Against scrying. Oh no, why is there more than one person? 20. Not Trinket. That's awesome. 4d10? Holy shit! Do you need extra ones? Here's a gold one for you. I want to tell Trinket to cannonball over the two lined up right there! Eat it! Go, Trinket! Good job, buddy! Little buddy! Then I get a move, still. I mean, I get an action. I'm going attack him! I'm going to attack the Broker! I mean, yes. I'm assuming that's his attack, or was that his move? I get to have Trinket attack, and then I get to attack. Wait, attack action plus Trinket attack. It says one attack for me and two attacks for Trinket. But he's got armor on. All right, fine. Okay, and then I'm going to shoot an arrow. Okay. That would be 26. 14. I'm going to assume-- I mean, it's probably way too far, but I want to keep my Hunter's Mark on Lord Briarwood for the time being. So I'm not going to break that, even though he's probably far away, so it's just 14 damage to the Broker. That's amazing. Yes, he is. Don't you feel so inspired? It's Grog. He doesn't give a shit about that. You're so smart, Grog! Look at you! When it comes to battle, he knows things. Yeah, the Broker. Get the Broker. Oh no, he got up. Can he get that close? From inside the wall. Oh shit. (laughter) Matt's like, damn you and your Counterspells. You're ruining my plan. I feel bad for her. He's so happy about it. I'm going to attack him with a bow. I'm going to attack him with my Entangle arrow. All right. Yeah. The guy in the mask. He's the only one left right? Oh, the old lady's still running away? All right, I'll attack the guy in the mask. That's a 28. All right, 15. Plus Entangle, whatever. It's the arrow. Awesome. And so I'll shoot another arrow at the other lady. I know she's running away, but she's a bad guy. I didn't hit her, though. 16. 16. I'm going to command Trinket to run after her. I don't have any idea. I don't know. I think it's Tiberius's turn. He and I have the same initiative. Ooh, I like it. I walk up and I take his mask off. No, that's disgusting! This is the masked guy. Sorry, darling. You live. No, she just reanimated him. What about the old lady? Do we get any loot off her? Here's a wand. I toss it back to them. There's a ring. I take it, put it on. For the time being. Inspiration! Plus ten! And if not there you can always fight in the Crucible. I've heard some terrible things about-- what is it, your father, is it? Or is it your uncle? Your uncle. Understandably. Not even a little. And we head back to the keep. Remember that promise. And everybody check her out on twitter. A wedding. And our anniversary is tomorrow. (cheering) I love you guys.
