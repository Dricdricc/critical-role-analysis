Oh, I've already rolled two. I know! And bring your dice, and we'll all roll together! We have a gnome! Travis will be smelling like bacon jerky for the rest of his life. Oh! It really does! I'm sure it's delicious! I saw! "Let's save everyone!" It actually is really good. Yeah, once you've tasted it, you don't smell the stank. You wanna try it? Right? It's disgusting! Oh no! God, I forgot about that! For all we know, the council is lost. How do we even make contact with them? Thordak is in the center of town. We know that Riskel made secret passageways in different places. Yeah. Did we ever find out if he put one in ours? Did we have one? That leads into the town? Maybe we can sneak in! Well, yeah! Hi, how's it going? Gilmore disappeared. I didn't see where he went. What places are left that have a teleportation circle? The smuggler's coves, all of them. That one! If Westruun is under attack, now, and we know Thordak is here, does that mean--? We could potentially attack one of his subordinates, though. One of the other dragons in Westruun, by themselves! Well, then we teleport right back out. Bad idea? Bad idea? Oh. Yeah, he is ancient, Grog! He is ancient! We can do that! Yes. Will you be leaving in the morning, then? Can you go tonight? Bahamut is a good guy? Cool. So there was no-- you didn't move it, you didn't do anything with it, it's still just sitting there. Maybe we can get Thordak near the little orb! I like it. Not anymore. That could be really, really terrible. They have children. MATT "Chromatics especially, from what I understand in my research, they do mate, but there "is no family structure, there is no love between brethren, other than the continued existence of "that bloodline. If a child of a dragon is slaughtered and one does find out, depending on if "it's their only brethren, it could incite a sense of vengeance, depending on the color. But I know "of no immediate children to Thordak. I have no knowledge of the other dragons which have attacked "this day." (laughs) We need to do as much research as we can. MATT "I have not seen Thordak myself in 15 years, and I know not the state of which he is in, or "what power he has now gained. Whatever information you can gather safely, right now, is going to "guide us down the rest of this path in attempting to take this terrible creature down." Right, but they're powerful people! They could help us. Experience and warrior-wise. What about you, Scanlan? You're so good at lying, and-- And sucking up, and grovelling-- Trinket can't talk! Slave Leia outfit, with a chain around your neck! Dragons eat. Let's just think about it, all right, Scanlan? General Krieg was here for a while, before we discovered him. He had friends. No, but he was one of them. We need to see-- get in the city and find some people. Allura, you be safe-- -- and silent and swift, and you get back here as quickly as possible. It's already morning the next day? Ah, fudge. Take a nap. Sleep as little as possible that will actually get us rested. Long rest. Should we sleep and get up in the morning and hit it? That's true. I mean, can I sense Thordak and figure out, I mean, is he just settling in that one spot? Is there anything else around or is it just him in the center, being a dick, and no other movement of other things? They went to hit the other cities, obviously. What? Should we? Yeah. Hey Matt, I was helping, too, mother-- Wait! Okay. Whoa! 24. How the fuck do we get that ability? She's so fucking cool. Do you think that was her or do you think that was Drake? Oh man, that's so cool! (gasp) Oh, no! Maybe he-- Okay, when you are sensing things, does that mean you would sense if they were alive or you wouldn't sense them at all if they were dead? Okay, so they could be dead in the city and you'd still sense them? He could have a teleportation circle. We go then, if it hasn't been ransacked already. Should we stealth in and see what we can see? I don't know, I feel like we need to rest, y'all. I'm pretty low and I'm almost out of dice. Potentially. I don't know, what are you talking about? Yes, I think it's reasonably well-hidden at this moment. I don't know. We should head out. We're going to march under the city. Before we left, I wanted to find Jarett really fast. I walk up and I hand him a bag of 300 gold and I say, this is, far and away, so much more than we asked you to do when we hired you. And I appreciate everything you're doing. Take care of the keep. Use this money to take care of the people here. Then I give him additional 100 gold. I resist the urge to mug down with him and I walk away. I put my hood up. Get up there. See what you see. Natural 20. Stealth, stealth, stealth, everybody. I cast Pass Without a Trace. I cast Pass Without a Trace on us. Wait, wait! How's Trinket going to climb up this rope, y'all? Polymorph? Shut up! Okay, what if we polymorph him into a very small raccoon? But he's got hands, you know, so he can hold things? Honey badger don't give a shit. It just takes what it wants. Is Polymorph a concentration? No! He can hang on to me. Will he still get his armor? But lemurs are slow, dude. Raccoons are cool. Red panda! Aww, I love you! He's so cute! I pick him up and I tell him to hang on to me. Stealth. Can we all stealth? Let's do it. You add ten because-- Oh, no! 33. You added ten? Add ten to it. Pass Without a Trace. Can she hear? So 14. Chained back up the outhouse. Go along the wall to the other side to get to Gilmore's? Sneaky. And they're like the people in our keep? They're past the point of healing? I want to see if Cure Wounds is-- I'm going to just try? I take out a arrow and say, stop! Who are you talking about? I can speak Thieves' Cant, too. I'm reading his damn lips as he's doing it. You're a member of the Clasp, then? Ugh. Are you one of the people looting? You said you saw other people doing the same. We need to get across town and not be seen. And we'll make a lot of noise clearing it out. Best to skirt. Do it then. Whoa, you're using a 6th-level spell right now? No, let's just stealth it. Yeah, save that. Scavengers. Don't test us. Stop! Stop! Stop. You will take it to him? Thordak? Listen. There's so much more available to you, buildings up that way. Not worth your time right here. Is it worth your death? Bringing this to him, is it worth your death? Because you will die here. Step on and go find loot somewhere else. At least then you can present it to him and not die here. Don't be stupid. Ugh, I rolled so poorly. Anybody want to assist me? (sings) How about ten? I've got passive perception! Motherfuck! Natural fucking 20. Do they? They're just looters. Garthok, did you lead us here? Did you know about this? Sure, why not. In his face and I have Trinket on my back. Too late for that. Probably stay away from huge magical effects. 27. Natural 20. Pike lost completely all connection. Yeah, I think she said she was probably going to have to leave until the break until we can figure out the tech. Okay, I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on that motherfucker in front of me. And then I'm going to cast Conjure Barrage at all of them in front of me, like a big cone effect. Just towards all the guys in front of me. I want to get as many in the cone as I can. Oh, that's my brother. I can see what's happening now. Yeah, I move over then I-- It's a 60-foot cone. Great. So, Trinket is still on my back. He's a red panda. I fire it and I shoot forward and that's it, huh? I don't have to, like-- Okay, cool. So I'm going to cast that at-- oh, it's already at third level, okay. Whoa. 15? And then I add my type anything? Or it's just 15. For my Hunter's Mark. Do I add my Bracers of Archery, though, on that? 17 and an additional six on-- 15. Do I add my spell attack bonus? I understand. I don't understand. I take the rest of my moment to back up against a wall. Fuck that guy. I move my Hunter's Mark to the next guy because the other one went to zero. Oh. It said when it went down to zero, I could move it to the next person. I understand. Oh shit, there's two more? I didn't see those guys. I saw one of them, but I didn't see all of them. They're going to get sneak attacks on me. Ugh. No, two attacks hit. Okay! Whoa, I like it! We ain't seen Minxie in a while. Nice! I like that right before it he saw a giant bear appear. (laughter) Get it! Loser! Loser with your 11 AC! What! How long does that last? Don't rest ever! (laughter) So for every person you hit, it makes it better and better and better! Awesome. Look at you buddies! Not yet! Fuck. Guiding Bolt's pretty sick. Awesome. As my bonus action I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns, so my next attack that hits turns into a poof. Okay. So I'm going to do that and then I'm going to cast-- I'm going to shoot-- oh shit. Can I shoot through the guy in front of me or to the guy with the bolt? Or is that too hard? Balls. But they would hit me? I'm going to move back five feet. Yeah. Fuck both of you, as I back up. And then I shoot the arrow at the guy in the middle of the two. Okay. That is 22 to hit. Okay, so. That means-- I'm casting that at third level, so that's 3d10 of damage. Right. And that's just my first attack. Where's my other dice? Come on! That's seven, eight, nine. Then, do I do that for each person or that's it? That's a ten. Nice. And then I'm going to move Trinket around. No, he's going to move up and attack the guy in front of him. Yeah, so I get to cast-- Right. So I wanted Trinket to do his Bestial Fury. Yeah, he's doing Bestial Fury and claw that motherfucker. That. No, the other one. That's 14. And then 2d4 plus seven. Oh, sweet. That's 11 on the first. And 13 on the second. Very nice, very nice. Yeah. This is the best thing ever! That is mean. He just saw Trinket rip somebody else's face off. Oh, yeah it does. He's got a better armor class than me. He's resistant to bludgeoning damage because of his armor. He won't miss. This will be sick, though, if he hit it. Right in the face! You could've been a 20, though, your next one could be a 20. It was a 20! Another natural 20! Oh my god. 2d12. So now you can take the other guy, because you killed him. Oh my lord. Oh my gosh. Worst intimidation ever. We shouldn't have taken him hostage. I wanted to just kill him. And the dwarf who is looting things now. I, actually, you know what? Instead of looting, I'm going to-- I'm actually going to start using perception to look for any sign of Gilmore in the rubble or-- Okay. I leave him to you all. Natural 20 on investigation. Well, he's still there. And we do have a dwarf that's mind-controlled right now. That is probably the best. Don't touch anything. I'm investigating. I rush over to it. Can I detect traps now? Oh. 26. I start pushing on the bed and call for Grog and say, help me with this! There's a door. Did he get everything? I mean, did he loot everything, are we--? Assholes. The dragon. But wait, tell us where it is, how about that? How about you tell us where it is. Right now. He's going to save eventually. He's going to break your mind control. Maybe we should knock him out right now. Knock him out! Tie him up. I don't want him waking up and running back to the dragon. I understand that, Grog. Maybe we should just tie him up. Tie him up and tie him up to a big stone so he can't get up and run even if he-- Now. Sherri? Don't attack! Did you work here? We're looking for Gilmore. Stay and guard the unconscious fucks. If they start to wake up, sit on them! Or kill them, if necessary. Empress! Is Uriel down here? Did you make it out? The children! Can you, like, Greater Restoration? I mean, what's the best cure you can do, Pike? 22? No offense, darling, but you look like shit. Alive. Did you see him fall? I mean, I can cast Cure Wounds on him to try to help out at all. Will it help? I mean, you know, more than I would. Perhaps sent a spy and try to trick him? (chuckles) That would have been stupid, huh? Gilmore, we called for you. I'm sorry we didn't wait. Poisonous fume? It would be smart. Anyone that was alive that you saw? Does the Cinder King have mind control abilities, or is he just super impressive? And fared quite well! That doesn't sound super good. Could I have just a little bit of time? Before we-- Oh, up top. You know, I'll be right back. Just for a second. I mean, if you guys want to join, if anybody wants to come with me, but I'm going to stealth like a motherfucker. Would they listen to you? They don't like us very much. All right. I want to go get that fucking well full of fucking loot. Magical items, gold, who knows what could be in there that could help us? No no no! They never gave it to him. They gathered a bunch of shit and they hid it in a well. No, they were going to get it all together and give it to him, but they never gave it to him. The dragon doesn't know about the gold. If you're scared, then go with Gilmore. I'm going to go get the gold. Grog? Gimme the Bag of Holding, then. Where am I going to put all the gold? I've got the Bag of Holding. I cast Pass Without a Trace on myself and anybody else joining me? Scanlan. Well, then, don't be pissy about it. We'll be right back. I mean, it's magic shit! Gilmore, I'm going to get your shit back for you. Right? Pass Without a Trace on the three of us. Stealth like a motherfucker. Yeah. Us three. Stealth out. It's like a 15-minute walk. I'm going to look out for that shit this time. Look, see? See? Look at this. I'm going to stay separate from the group so I can stealth a little bit better. I'm stealthing. Pass Without a Trace on all of us, then. Are we all heading towards the well to jump down to the Clasp, or is anybody going back towards the Keep right now? And the kids. Get them back to the keep. I don't think we should bring three children into the Clasp. Perfect plan! Let's go. 29, 39 on stealth for me. Plus ten? Trinket's going with you guys, by the way. Do what you got to do, Garthok. What're you doing? Where do you want us to meet you? Which entrance? Better fucking stealth like a motherfucker. Yeah, 26 stealth, Pike! I'm keeping my eye out for any kind of anything in front of us. You motherfucker! Got it. Now is all that shit up top going to be open for us when we come back? It's going to be a while, you know. We've got to get the treasure and go back to the Keep and come back-- I mean, it's up to you. I know you need to talk to the Clasp, so if you need to talk to them and let them know we're on our way-- It's up to you. You're not with us. 19. I look around. Can I perceive anything or any people around, anything? Natural 20. Dicks! Dicks. No, whoever the fuck came and took all the fucking gold. Can I take one of the shovels and move some of the dirt to see if maybe it's deeper than it looks? What a waste. Can I use tracking to see if it looks like anybody's been here? 19. Is that 17 or 11? That's 11. Okay, yeah. I never thought, when we came back up out of the fucking trap door, were the people still unconscious? Oh, okay. Look, the reason I wanted to come get all of this gold is because I thought there could be a lot of Gilmore's magical items that were probably put in here. People don't realize what they have. I thought it could help us a lot. But what if it's just one or two people that came and stole everything and we could totally take them. And they're like right up the alley. Like right there. Can I stealth ahead a little bit and see? I said I was going to be right back, Scanlan! Ah, shit. Fuck it. They're taking it to the fucking dragon. Dicks. No, we'll fucking go back. Hey. We'll get back. What happened to-- where's Gorthok? Garthok. Where is he? Oh, well. I am. I start walking back to the keep. What? Trinket's with you guys, don't forget. Yeah. Yeah, Keyleth. He talked me out of it. I walk past. Oh, you guys are all so wonderful and we love you. Yes, please. Yay, Garthok! Thank you, thank you.
