Yeah. Don't get me wrong, it's really great, because-- Tablet device. I've got Matt's tablet device. I know, I can find out a bunch of stuff! But I probably shouldn't. I mean, it's got all these characters, his NPCs. I don't think so! Yeah, in the store right now we've got crazy things! We've got all the stuff that was available-- well hold on, because here's the thing. So Matt had logged into my iPad. I don't remember my password. I'm just try to figure out, because my character sheet is on here. That's what it was, thank you. Anywho, we've got all the stuff from Gen Con, (Valley girl voice) like, available in the store, like, right, now. In the store? Yeah. So we've got the map. Wildemount map by Deven Rue, who is amazing and the map is amazing. You guys should check it out. We've got our pins. We've got our Mighty Nein pin and our Vox Machina pin, and enamel pins, they're so cool! We've got a dice set that's a Wildemount dice set! It's navy blue, we picked out the colors ourselves! We've got the monogram design was from Crystal Sharp. We also have a Yasha mini bust. It's this big, by Steamforge, and it's really cool. It's metal, it's heavy, it looks really awesome, and it comes in a really cool little box. All the stuff that was there before is there now, too! We have more hats coming, because I know you guys like them. Yeah, the dad hats. They are really cool. Whoa, werewolves! Okay, I'm going to sign in. Well no, I'm getting an email to tell me what my password is! Tablet device. You guys, it's all coming together. Hello. Bough-wow. The path will be covered with mud. Does it? Well the stream will be flooded with all this rain. (laughing) Just to fuck with our DM. In da wain? Why isn't the castle lit up? They're not expensive. Any time father knows we're coming he makes the castle ready. This is strange. Possible. I think we should enter the castle warily. Off of the horses. You want to ride in there, Benny? Oh my god, there's a flame in your hand right now! The castle's overrun, you're just going to get attacked? Do you think there's not a good reason all the flames are out? Is there a side entrance? There's a side entrance; we all know about it. (whispering) The side entrance. It's a pretty small tunnel. Benny, you might not fit now; you're so big. Stealthily. We'll do it quietly so no one notices us. Don't let him transform the whole game. Make sure you never let him transform. How good is our vision? 14. Did you get a one? Smells of love, you heard him. Smells of love! How old is the door? Can we bust through the bottom part of the wood or something? Should I try? I am so fucking strong. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try and just-- through the bottom. If you want me to have advantage. Do you want me to have advantage because he's helping me? Is it a wooden door? Yeah, at the bottom. I'm going to aim below where the barricade is, I'm going to try to make a tunnel at the bottom of it, you know what I mean? The bottom center, where it's the weakest. Do I see a weak spot where the wood-- I mean, it's pretty old. There's a tunnel. Is there rotted wood anywhere? I want to aim for that. Jesus H. It's fine. What do I do, add my strength modifier? 20. Wait, 11 plus seven. 18. All of the rest of the slats. Just really try to-- Does it smell sweet? Does it smell like death? It smells like death in there. Really try to bust through. Will you stick your flame hand through the door? What can we see? Does it look like a lot of bodies in there? Two legs and an arm of the same body? Do we recognize any of the bodies? Look for Father. 14, for finding Dad, too. I'm going to shoulder-- To hit it? You rolled a two to hit it? Ooh, he's got a tower! I don't know, but it looks so cool. Now I want one. Did you say how long they've been here? Wait, Lucius, arm yourself! Everyone, arm yourself. Does it look like the bodies were dragged into the temple, or does it look like they were murdered inside the temple? 15. The rain, of course, gets rid of the tracks. Where do you smell him? These were innocents. These were our people. We were suppose to protect them. This is an act of war. Definitely keeping an eye out for any movement, anything that catches our eye. Aurra, she's the oldest. I walk up the table and swipe up the playing cards. Try to sniff them. See if I smell anybody that we recognize. Damn it. I got a 19 and a fucking one! I look around the room. Is there any tracks in the room? Anybody that looks like they might still be hiding in the room? 12. Wet prints! It means whoever was here was here during the rain. Which means they're probably still in the building. Yes. Human boots. I don't think so, no. Oh, wait. Is that a cantrip? Motherfuck. It's really a cantrip? He's noisy! You're really noisy, Lucius. Why? Get the fuck off me. Larry. I walk up timidly to the hand and look at the note. I take Father's ring. I'm going to put it-- Is it magical? I'm going to put it on a chain around my neck. Do I think it's magical? Is it magic? Oh god. Is it-- Is it a longsword? Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You are kind of a magic person, and so people who, like, use swords should probably use the sword. I'm just saying. It's a fucking longsword. That's kind of what I specialize in, you motherfuckers. We're just saying you might be better with a staff. That's what I mean. While we're distracting her I go to take it-- Ooh! You gave up your right when you took up the fucking woods! I mastered The Taming! I stayed at the house! It's right here! This is mine. I earned this. Thanks. But there are claw marks on the bedding. Did this happen before they took Father, or--? Can I look around that room and see-- I mean, because, somebody left their weapons here. They're still here. Meths. What is-- Oh, I do. Oh no, I speak Sylvan. Lawrence. Why do you pretend you have an accent? We all grew up together, you don't have an accent. She's like, "All of this research?" Were they Elvish? Did they have pointy ears? Should we go down to the crypts, should we try to rescue Father? Do we recognize it? 18. It's definitely not from Wildemount. No. If you were six, we weren't born yet. I sit down in the rain with Father's sword across my knees and try to figure out what it does. (whispering) There's no plus two longsword in D&D Beyond. I don't understand what you guys are saying. I add it to my hit, or do I add it to my damage, or both? Awesome. Are we trying to be sneaky? They know we're here. They know we're coming. Should we split up and enter from both sides? I'm not doing it. So we should move stealthily? Shit. I got a total of six. As they climb it I walk around it. Really?! Can you smell Father? Ooh, that means roll it twice. That's a nine. Ooh, much better. Plus? Perception? Whoa, 23! Do I hear movement? Ten. I'll go with the lame-o twins. We'll take the right. Is someone camping in our cemetery? I mean, we're on opposite sides we have to communicate with our siblings on the the other. (pigeon cooing) Campfire. (more pigeon coos) Yeah. Do we see the light? Have we? I mean, we saw the dancing reflection. Stealthily. Can we creep up to the edge of the door? I want to see if I can see a reflection in my sword. You know, if I stick-- Use it like a mirror, you know? Oh my god, he's getting a map. The bottom is the dot. And you have an initiative number. This is amazing! Are those dead people? What's going on? And he's bringing up the dead. That's the dick that was in your room. 18. Ooh, cool! Ooh skelly, skelly, skeletons! Oh, we can see when they go? That's good. Oh, that's me! Oh my god. Okay. Oh god! Totally! I've got a badass sword! Oh wait, I'm not seeing my bonus actions here? So our curses we can do once per-- no, our curses was can just do every turn? Mine is the Blood Curse of Binding! Binding is not-- is as many times as I want, right? Because it's just a bonus action. Oh really? Then I'm going to hold on, and I'm going to-- but the gate is closed? Oh god, no. I'm going to run up to this guy in the corner closest to me. Yeah. I'm going to swipe at his legs! Because I don't want to take his head off because he's my ancestor! So I'm going to roll. Ooh! That's a 24! Not yet! 14 damage! No, I'm taking his legs off. My second attack I'm going to run forward and get this other guy closest to me. I'm going to try it again! That's not as good, that's a 12. I'm going to look at the living guy, and I'm going to go I fucking see you. No! Oh, it's a dead dog? Okay, can I ask you a question? So our rites, can we do that every turn? Oh shit, really? I think you only can do one of the swords, I don't think you can do both. It is 16. What the fuck? That's a lot of damage. Yeah. What the fuck? Ah! Thanks, Benny. Entangle might have to be on the ground. Oh, you can only do one spell per-- Oh me? I want to kill this-- oh, wait, first I'm going to Crimson Rite my sword! Wait, should I, though? Because my hit points are pretty fucking low already. Ugh, I'm going to Crimson Rite my sword! Hix points. I want to do fire damage. I've seen my brother do it, and I do it too. Okay. I'm going to hit this skeleton, I guess. 18. What do I add for my-- do I add six to the damage now? Really? Awesome. 16 points of damage. Yeah. I'm going to run over to my brother-- No, not that one. The other one. My weakling brother. I'm going to go-- the one-- at his back. Sweet, and I'm going to try to hit him. Good thing there's advantage. 14 plus nine, so that hits. I did it. 18. (whispering) That's the end of my turn. Oh, wait! Do I have any movement left? I want to step on the-- no, to where the stone is blocking me to that stupid girl on the roof. Tell me that's going to get a swipe! Do the undead-- wait. Are they... do undead take cold damage, are they-- I'm standing right there, got a real good view of it, and I start (slow clapping). He got stabbed in the back four fucking times and he still ran away? Entanglement! Yeah, let them run. Yeah. But-- so they're going after him? It's because they're our ancestors. They know who the enemy is. (triumphant laugh) But she could stand up right next to her. So 14. Your own spell bested you. Blood. Blood. Blood. --pouring out of my shoulder-- (laughter) I know, when the healer doesn't want to heal. (devious laughter) What are you praying for? Ten points? Lucius... thank you. I know. Obviously. Guidance, guys. I'm going to-- I'm going to walk up to the door of the crypt. Right. Shit. Okay. I guess I'm going to run-- try to get over to the corner and get that green thingy. Yeah. Sure, why not. I can do 40 feet. I have skills. I'm going to just stand there. Oh, that's true. I'll go for another 40 feet. Thanks. Brought dead people to life, if I wanted. Yeah, just go there. (laughter) Yeah. I don't know, do you-- no! I don't know. How come we don't know anything? (gasp) You're walking into the crypt. Alone. He. Went. I was waiting for everyone. That's her bonus action? Oh wait, that's the dude you killed! (laughter) (shouting) Oh my god! Oh, right. He still gets a reaction. 16. (grunt) Do it. Do it! Somebody has faith in their siblings. Yes! (singing) Our brother is awesome! Ha! I'm going to attack the guy that's in front of me. (babbling) 18. Ooh! Eight, sixteen, plus five, is 21 points of damage to the guy. While I shake it hard, I swing at the next guy standing next to me. Yeah! 16. Ooh, yeah that's good. Eight plus eight is 16, plus six is 22. Then I step back next to Benicio and I say, It's your turn, Benny. Whoa! Yeah, that's a good one. Did she say who took him? It was an elf! Told you, fucking pointy ears, man. I mean, I'm at halfsies. Dad might be bleeding out right now. Yeah, we should take a short rest. I can't believe you guys didn't bury grandmother down here. Great aunt. Whatever. Katerine. Our entire family is down here. He gets a lot of action. For what? Let's move forward. How far away is it? We don't know who did it. I follow. We're going into the tunnels. Aurra? Can you smell him? Wait, roll again! But the other one was higher, so it was 12 plus-- Do you smell him? Yeah, going off to find Daddy. I don't know. Is it close? If we can hear them breathing, they're close. I just don't want to waste it. I go. I'm going to go wolf. Okay. I resemble the way my hair is, so I'm all black fur on top, and my underside is all stark white. Kind of like a reverse skunk! Yeah! Yeah. And I'm clutching his ring around my neck. It has a long chain, so it's not strangling me or anything. Kind of like a whisper. He only thinks he's smarter than you. Ah! No, we're going in; and we're barging in! (growling) Do we recognize him? Her? Them? 13. 100 feet away from us? So it looks like little human arms? No, they definitely look like human arms. That's cool! That's cool. Do we start-- Can we start running towards him? I want to fucking charge him. Yeah! Who's charging? Is anyone charging with me? I think you can do three attacks with your claws, and two attacks with your-- I've got a thing. How far away from him are we now? Yeah. 23. That's crazy! Oh god! I'm going to-- Oh, god. I can only hold an action, I can't hold a whole move. But can I let someone go before me, before I go? Okay, which one am I? Okay. How far away is Benny from the baddie? Okay. I'm going to run forward, to Benicio. I'm going to bonus action Shared Passage. That's the one where I can teleport 40 feet. TJ and I'm going to teleport 40 feet, and then I'm going to run the last little bit up and attack him. And I'm going to bring Benny with me. I bring somebody with me my size. So we'll bamf to the end of the steps. I'll run up the rest and attack him. Oh man! I'm going to hit him twice, with the sword. I'm going to try to. Okay! 15 plus nine. No, because I already bonus actioned to teleport. Okay. And then-- 13 points on the first hit. Oh, natural one for the second. Oh! Natural one really fucked me there! Oh no! But if the guy can hit him it'll give him an attack of advantage or whatever! We lost our music again. What did you do?! In my prone self, I see-- Dad. It's terrible. He had my back in the cemetery. What is that? It's a Spiritual Weapon. But her action originally was to cast Haste. Action, action, action, action, bonus action, action. Isn't it a spell, though? You can't do two spells in one turn. Oh no! Oh god. Okay. Well, from the ground, I'm going to-- oh god! (as Jester) Technically, I'm really nervous right now. (as Laura) Okay. Because I'm on the ground, I guess I'm going to Crimson Rite myself? But are they as good as my sword, though? How much damage do they do? But my sword does more damage. 1d10, it says. Why does this say 1d10 plus four under it? Okay! I'm going to attack her with my claws. I'm going to Rite of Passage on my claws! Bonus action! Storm damage as well! Light-en-ing damage. Then I'm going to stand up. As I stand, I'm going to-- 14 plus seven? Okay. 12 plus seven. 19. Okay. So then it's what plus-- what do I roll? A d6? Plus a d6? No, I do! Yeah. It's just an unarmed strike? Okay, cool. Ooh, ten plus five. So 15 on the first attack. Then 11 on the second one. Mathis. What's mathis? Wait, but I stand up. Can I--? I'm standing. Can I stand up? Okay. Oh no. What does she roll? I have 17 AC. Damn it. Genevieve is one of my favorite names, too! What? Oh, so I have resistance! Okay. You said 13? Oh no. Ooh! Damn, I really should have grabbed Lawrence. Did you crit yourself on the first one? Just make it up. So, check out that store (mumbling). Do you have any more Twizzlers? Can I have one of those? Oh, that's what you were looking up. What was that? Me? That hits me. I might. But that's-- oh, that is magical. That fucking necrotic damage. Oh, shit. How do we know what's going to-- Six? Did I take six points from that spear? Ooh, that's good, okay. Plus... Plus five. No, no, no. Do-- That's a big wolf. Bonus action? So you can still attack like that? Kill her! Disadvantage? But big! Ahh! Bite her! Bite her! Ugh. I like that we're surrounding her though. Because she's stuck in that form. He's schooling us. (groans) Oh no. Where's your Wisdom at? Where's your Wisdom at, sister? 15. Ooh, yes! You did it! Okay. I roll a d20 and get higher than a ten. Oh god. Oh no. Ten! Phew! Oh, well, yeah. Fuck up that Iron Woe. Oh! Well then, I'm going to do that. I've got to see what my other bonus action could be. Fuck it, I'm just going to do it. (growls) I'm going to attack her! I know, but-- I've looked and one is a reaction. I just need to remember it. 11 on the first-- oh wait, I should probably roll to see if it hits. I'm dumb. Natural 20! (cheering) 18 natural-- wait, natural 16 on the second one, so that hits again. Ten plus five, 15 on the second hit. Third swipe-- Then 13 plus six, 19, that hits again. That's eight. These are my claws! Oh no, I didn't do-- that last one was to see if it hits, this last one is only eight points of damage. Crazy. And eight. It's 1d6 plus the Rite of-- Wait, plus strength? Okay. She'll get a swipe at me, but-- Yeah, okay, I'm going to back up. No. Fuck it. I'm going to stand there. Fuck it. But all the dice. Plus ten. You double that too. Oh, that's right, we're all flanking her. But you have advantage because you're flanking. So it's balanced. You get to roll to see if you stay frightened at the top of a turn, or does it keep frightened? She's very scary. Ahh, the Iron Woe. Why Portia? Yeah, that hits me. Is she magical? Oh no. Is she flanking her? Plus a d4, so this one. 16. Do it! Claw her! You chose your weapon correctly. Yes! Do we get-- I'm going to run over and-- I'm going to run over to the Iron Woe and hit her a couple times. Yes, claw, claw, claw. See if it hits. That first one doesn't hit. That second one does hit. Third-- oh wait, I wanted to go around to the back of her. So I could flank her. Can I flank her? So those first two rolls, do I just say the first one hit, and then I'll roll again. I rolled a 19, natural 19 on that. Next hit. No, this is the second attack. No, because I got advantage, remember? Because I'm flanking. Natural 20 on the second one! I don't think the last one hits. Eight plus, whatever it is, six. 14. Okay, the first one is six plus five is 11. Then the critical. Oh, that's four. Eight plus five. Yeah. I use the stalagmite and I swing around it and I-- (growls) Oh yeah, you can't move closer to her. It's right next to-- Yeah. Werewolves, blood hunters. Curses. It doesn't say it has to be? 2d6? LIAM, SAM, and That was the bonus-- She's looking rough. Oh my god, those were two spells you have up that you can just attack with. That's badass. Yeah, because Spiritual is not a concentration. Yeah. Moombeam. (singing) Guiding Bolt, her up the butt. (singing) Give us an advantage on the next attack! (deadpan fanfare) Sweet. All right, I'm going to run up to her. Do I get advantage on all three attacks, or just the first attack? From the Guiding Bolt. I think it's just the first attack, so I'm going to flank her. That's not me. I'm the reddish one. Right. Yes, but the reddish paint. Okay, I'm going to try to hit her! 17 plus something; that first one hits. Second one, natural 20! Hit, natural 20. Third is 11 plus six, 16. No, 17. Still doesn't hit. First one. Eight plus five is 13. And then the critical. Aw man. Eight plus five is 13 again. Yeah. It's not considered a weapon attack, is it? It's just a claw attack? Zoinks! Oh no, I'm almost dead! No! I'm still standing. We're flanking her, yo, so you're at advantage. I'll duck every time. So 24! With one fucking bonus attack. What is he doing? You get another attack on him! Don't let him get away! Oh yeah, you can totally do that! She just picks a point on the ground and he has to make a save. 120 feet! (howls) That was my howl, did you like it? What is it? Natural 20? But you love me most. Man, a druid, that's a hard one to go on first time. It is, like, the hardest class.
