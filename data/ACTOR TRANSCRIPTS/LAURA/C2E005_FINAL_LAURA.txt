Did you just have them? Or do we need to send you our characters? I didn't see it, I was recording. I didn't look at my phone. That means all of you guys were texting in your sessions. It was you, Liam, until he brought up the Merkin. What's a kenku? Yeah, I know. Shut up! That was good. That was close, I'm not going to count it. This is the one Sam gave me, so we'll see. I have something. The Shadow of War expansion pack, The Blade of Galadriel, came out and you can play and be me, so get it and play. Yeah, basically just me, running around Mordor. Yeah, so check it out. Shut up! What? No. What? He just tunes it out now. We chased after it, right? We don't just lose it. It's really pretty. Does anyone want a donut from my bag? Okay, here you go. I don't have them in real life, just this one in real life. But in the game, you guys are having delicious donuts. Yeah, here you go. You're doing it, Peter, you're doing it! These donuts are not that old. They're pretty new, yes. Just eat it, it's good. That's right. It's like sprinkles. Did you travel in a wagon when you were with your family? Oh, nice. Can you swallow it? What are the components? Have you ever made him a turtle? Have you ever made him a snake? Have you ever made him a roach? Have you ever made him a unicorn? They exist, you know. They do. Six? Is Frumpkin back? Do we know all these things yet? Do they look like they're in armor? Do they look like they're soldiers? Do they look like they're mean? Do you see, are they carrying money? Are they carrying people? Five! Yeah. But we get to be lazy. Are you going to Nicodranas? Hi. Hi, are you going to Nicodranas? Oh. Oh! Did you come from Zadash? How far is it to Zadash? Thank you! Plus five. As you drop them all over the ground. He can tell your fortune! They're stupid. Yeah! Is it? What does it mean? It was the chariot. He's just trying to get you in trouble. Did you hijack a cart? You want to do it? Ooh! I bet someone's going to try to hijack our shit on the road just like we were talking about then. Yes. We should lead it off the road. Just off the road a little bit. Maybe she likes climbing trees. Pick some flowers. Do you need me to lift you up to the branch? None of us were nearby when he was saying all of that. I lift Beau up to the branch just because. Yeah, I'll jump! We sit up in the branches. I've never climbed a tree before. Yeah. This is really pretty. Probably very small unicorns. Yes, I've seen many. The little ones can be as small as hamsters. Yeah. All over. You just have to know where to look. It's pretty great! Oh, that's pretty cold. Can we get the horse over to them? This is why we should've taken one of the circus tents. Yeah, but think about how cool it would be to camp in one. I get my little bouquet of wildflowers and I give it to Nott. Well, you said all girls like flowers. I don't know, you are my friend. I'll take first watch. I like it. Oh, god damn it! Yeah, one. So pretty good. Sorry, guys. Little tiny hamster unicorns! It's really cute! All wrapped up in a little swaddling blanket! I'm so tired! (snores) She can't see! She's human, too! (laughter) Can you hear him? That is awesome! Sick. Oh my gosh, I love it. It's a cantrip? How far does it go? Oh, the cutest unicorn hamsters. (singing) Who's got the third watch? Oh no! We're supposed to come in! What does he look like? What are we doing? Fjord! Have I ever seen this happen to him before? Jeez, Fjord. That's a lot of drool. What happened, Fjord? Why the water, though? I do like pickles. Is it really the lowest? Fjord, do you think you're slowly turning into water? If you feel like it's happening, let us know and we'll try to catch you in a jar. Maybe something can happen. I've never seen him wake up with water all over him. Of all things, it's way better than vomit. If we get really thirsty, we'll just come to you in the morning. Oh, really? What is his name? This horse? Maybe he has a name. Molly? I like it, it's like a celebration. I feel like my mom saw lots of visitors from other places. I wander over to the wagon and I go and sit down and start drawing, because I need to. I need to spend a little time. I have decent perception, what's yours? Okay. You guys just hunker down in the wagon, okay? You be safe. Whoa. That's because you guys are-- oh, no, you're riding in the cart. Nine. Aw. How do we do that in here? Disadvantage on abilities? Okay, okay, okay. Oh no. Does it look like the fire is spreading at all? We're walking. What things? Dogs are attacking the village! Werewolves! Is that a werehyena? What is it? You know how to kill them? Is he within range to hit with a spell? Go after the one that stole the guy. Yeah. For each one? How many are there? I just don't want to get overwhelmed is all. I have a shield. Did you leave it? Whoa! Oh my gosh. Where are we? This is so cool. Look at that flame on the side of the roof. Before I ran over here, I'm going to Caleb. I'll hit you on the shoulder and say, bless you. And I'm going to give you Blessing of the Trickster just in case you want to stealth because you're squishy, yo. Yes. How far away are the ones on the roof? How long is the distance from us? Six. Yeah, well, I'm exhausted. Can I invoke Duplicity? Can I use my bonus action really fast? To say a little pray to the Traveler, and I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon. I'm going to cast it right above this zombie gnoll. It's going to be in the shape of a giant lollipop. Like a bludgeoning lollipop. Yes! Yeah! Okay, 17? Ooh, seven. Seven radiant damage. Oh wait, oh wait, oh wait, I was looking at the wrong spell, hold on. Oh, 1d8 plus three! Seven plus three-- Ten! That ear is mine! And I'm going to send my duplicate after her. Yeah. Oh, really? Initiative is an ability? Are attack rolls? SAM and Okay. Did I already ask that? Thanks. Thanks, Sam. Can you lick this one? I'm going to put it back over here. I'm going to try it. Maybe it'll roll really well with your spit on it. It's so pretty, right? Seven. LIAM and Mm-hmm. Right there? (sings) K-N-O-L-L Oh no! 20! A teeny gnoll. Oh no. No, he's like a Grandmaster gnoll. Oh. I feel like that's a zombie gnoll. I pat him on the shoulder and say don't worry, nobody saw that. Dashy-dash? Okie dokie. I'm going to send my duplicate out against the wall on this house. Yeah. Against that wall. She can go up to 30 feet. And I'm going to run across-- Yeah, can I get against the wall further in? Yeah, right there, that's good. Oh yeah, I'm going to use my bonus action-- As I'm running, can I use my spiritual weapon and-- I think it's 30 feet. Let's see. 20 feet. You're right, I'm sorry. 20 feet. Towards the giant guy and hit him! Hit him with the rock! 15. Boo! For my action, can I still see my duplicate around the corner right there? She is going to cast-- Okay. She is going to use the cantrip Sacred Flame! Against the same big guy! Yes, basically yes, that's what I did. Technically I did this before I moved. Good! He has to beat 13! It hits him! Yes it does! Four. Well, that's one method to be able to reach. That's the Grog one. I like that you're facing the wall so it looks like-- I'm going to point out I've been doing it wrong because I was thinking of my duplicate as like Trinket was, which had movement the same as me, and it is a bonus action to move my duplicate, which I did not realize. I'm going to stop doing that. Yeah, I just looked it up and I'm sorry. Oh! That's real me! This makes my duplicate way less fun if I can't move her. That's my spiritual weapon. 120 feet. Yeah, at least she's directing fire. Isn't she harder to hit because she's so little? Or you drop it because he's prone and Molly will get super advantage on hitting him. Ooh. She's so wanted. (laughter) And a miss and a miss! Yeah, right? Yay! I'm going to run away from this guy that's next to me. I'm going to run out into the alley so I can see people. Yeah. Can I use a reaction on that? I'm going to say "I am rubber and you are glue" and use Hellish Rebuke on him. In Infernal. Okay. Maybe. Hold on. I'm applying my changes to my health. This is so much! Oh, 2d10. Okay. Nine. Ooh, chilly! I know, and my bonus action! So for my bonus action, I'm going to send my lollipop towards the giant guy and try to hit him. At the same time, I'm going to cast-- What am I going to cast? Radiant-- No, Guiding Bolt! With, you know, I'm going to do a little flourish, like pink energy comes out. Okay. Spell attack? Ooh, that's good. That's a 19 plus five. Okay. Yes, yes, yes. You didn't touch these ones. Six, eight, nine radiant. That's radiant damage, and then the Spiritual Weapon-- Oh, good. Then the Spiritual Weapon will have advantage. Great! Oh, good. So that's 20. Where's my eight? Six plus three is nine! Oh, I'm going to use the rest of my movement to run over and try to get behind this wall. That'll work. I was going to go to the brick wall. Yeah, sure, why not? You can do that?! Ugh! We got to get the cart! That means we almost killed him, that's what that means! We almost had him. Yeah. Have we killed any of the gnolls-gnolls? What about the guards? Aren't they going to attack this skeleton one that's right here next to both of us? Yes I had. I did the Hellish Rebuke to it. I am so surprised I fall off the wall! Okay. Are either of those two gnolls over there damaged? Okay, well, I'm going to use my giant lollipop, and it's going to swing and hit a couple times and try to hit one like a bat. Okay, this is the one you licked. Eight. Sam's spit not a good luck charm. Shit. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself, and then I'm going to leap off the wall with great flourish and land next to Caleb. Okay, that's a good idea. I'm going to land next to the guard. Then I'm going to skip away to the building. What happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else. Kill him! But at least it's not a critical attack. Whoa! What did you do? Yeah. But we didn't get to go, because Nott just jumped it. Basically. I was going to have my duplicate go over and touch the guy laughing on the ground, and cast Inflict Wounds. Natural 20. Five, six, 13, 26! Yeah. That's why it's more fun if I can move her. That's all happening right now. I run up and I'll cast Cure Wounds on Molly. Then I'm going to run over and do the same thing at level two to Nott. That's six points of healing for you, I'm sorry. I'll run up and cast it on Nott. Oh no, Nott! I pull her up into my lap. Oh, that's good. 13-- oh, 13 plus five! No, plus three. Of course, I say as I cut off the ears of some of the gnolls. These people have lost everything! That's okay because we got two ears off of all the other ones. I'm also going pull off a chunk of tail and see if it will pass. Did you notice they had some undead gnolls with them? Have you ever seen anything like that? Do they eat the bodies? Too much meat. What are they feeding? Oh. Or that. (gasps) W.C! I get up and I run and see if our horse is still there. Thanks, man! Thumbs up to the family, I'll run back to the group. No, I'm going to leave it out there. Yeah, they're petting him. 360 gold. If we do, that's 60 gold apiece. That's Laura talking. (laughter) I can help them... in the morning. (laughter) The broad? Are they doubles? Fulls? Queens? Twins? Worst roommate ever. 60 gold, Caleb! For all the work that Beau did. (laughter) (groan)
