There's stuff in the store! Oh my god. Are you so nervous, Matt? We'll find out he used crayon. It's all written in marker. No. We're still in Elysium. Are there any more gods here? Not that we know of. Yeah. I don't think Ioun is here. Maybe we can ask them. So the gods can't get in and out. We have to get near the the Cliffkeep Range, near the Pools of Wittebak, is where we need to go. What is Terrah? Teacher? I was excited the last game and somehow have misplaced my Pelor champion piece of paper. I don't know how it happened! It's not with my stuffs. You'll tell me? Okay. Oh shit, okay. I'm sorry. I had it, and it's not here. I'm in a lot of trouble, you guys. Are we by those fruit trees again? I'm so confused about the order of things. If we go to Ioun, and we don't have everything we need for this Prime Trammel, are we fucked? I know we need godly power in order to imbue them, right? Or something? Well, Pelor gave me this. Snap, snap, snap, zip. This. It's a stone and it's supposed to be strong enough to-- Part of it? Not all of it. But it did seem like this is not enough. Is it this size? Or this size? Vax? Can you sense Vecna? Is he still in the same place? Oh, hard to tell, then? We should maybe talk to the people of Terrah? It's not that late. Keyleth, perhaps you should let your people know that the world is in danger. Things are happening very quickly. We just happened here first. Giants? At the pools? I thought it was something about gnomes there. Is that something you can do, Scanlan? Maybe the person we're looking for is a giant. Hill giants. Seems like they ate a lot of them. Pasty, I have a question. Do you know anything about Ioun? But not much. I know. Okay. Just checking. This food is really good. I thought we were walking into a fucking lake with gnomes living there. I didn't realize we were going to fight giants. It's possible the key is now inside of a giant's stomach. In which case, it still would be inside of someone. Just a different someone. Oh! I remember it now! It was a home inside. Oh, I drew a little map of it. Yep, that's it. Yes, it's adjacent to the pools, but there's a home in a forest. Did you like it? That's what my map was. I mean and look out for a home in the forest? We'll have to fly pretty low. I'm assuming the home is going to be covered by treetop. It's very far. We could Misty Step to the forest and then walk in the forest? No reason, darling. Don't be dark and creepy and make it sound like you're being nice. I know you're being dark and creepy right now. Before everyone else gets up, can I go find where Vax is sleeping? This is a tent. What do I do? Do I knock? Do I shake it? I'm not sure. Scratch? Oi. Vax. Are you naked? Put some clothes on, then. Jesus. Keyleth, sorry. You don't sleep naked? Okay. Are you decent? I'm coming in. Ugh, come on! So fucking weird. (groans) I turn my back to him. Can I ask you a question? Well, I'm going to. I look down at my feet. Why didn't you ever try to take these back? Oh, Jesus. You know, the only reason I do things is that I take great joy in irritating you. If you don't show irritation, it makes it not worth it. (sighs) Can I turn around now? I'm turning around. Good. Why are you so calm? You're so calm and confident now. It's weird. Is he still cold? What's his heartbeat like? (groans) Jeez! Is there blood? (gasping) No fucking way! That's really cool. Wow. So she gave you the option and then you came back and now you're what? Super? Super half-elf? And we defeat Vecna and you're done, you're gone. That's it? Instant? Is it like we kill him and you're gone that second or is it like we kill him and you're here for another week or until the Raven Queen realizes that you're still here? She didn't tell you? Exorbitant? That's a good word. I know. We're blessed idiots. Yeah. After you die, do you stand by her side? Do you like her now? That's good. She brought you back to us for a while. I like her, too. Anyway, do you want the fucking boots back? Fuck! Yeah, sure, yes, fine, that's fine. I wanted to give them back, so there you go. I'm glad you asked for them back. I know. Just make sure you write it down somewhere that after you go back to the Raven Queen that your sister is your favorite in the universe. I don't want every stitch. None of it's worth you leaving. What? What?! The Feywild? You are a motherfucker. You couldn't have just put them in the Bag of Holding? Great, wonderful. I like being barefoot. That's great. Probably. All right. Well, at least there's that! Oh my gosh! I put it in the safe place and I didn't realize it! Did they really know where I put it? Wow, thank you. Thank you, guys! (mispronouncing) Wind. You could have gotten the last one, though. Should we eat a feast first, or should we save that? Okay. I don't know what we're going to find! Yeah! Towards the mountains! We got to look at our map. We have a map! After listening to everybody, I'll lead the way. That way, I can keep an eye out for the forest next, too, and the house and all the things we're looking for. I got a good look at the map that Pelor held up in front of us, as well. Survival? Great. Any advantage on that? That's also my favored. Oh! So much better. 28. Wet 'N' Wild? Yeah, past the pools. Oh man. I should try to track any footprints in there and see if there's something around the edges, maybe, that lead back to-- shit, I don't fucking know. It's only a couple of miles. It's the forest. Do I get advantage on that one? Perception? What is that, 21? 21. Can we fly down lower to where we're in between the trees? I'll go. All of us? Not so much tracking right now, just a loose passover as we're going, looking for any kind of hunting traps or trails, signs of life of things that have been traversed a lot. 27. Okay. We land. I land. And behind a tree, I'm going to take form. Yay! I don't want whoever it is to think that we threaten them in any way. But then, if they threaten us, I wouldn't want them to attack us, either. I feel like maybe knock properly. Yeah. But do keep an eye out for traps or anything weird on the way up. Yeah, I'll go with you. I'm walking with a smile, looking very friendly. I'll walk behind Scanlan. It's possible the person is the key; we're not sure. No, he's out. He's a very friendly bear, look at him! Trinket, smile! Be friendly! What is it? I was being friendly, and it almost crushed me. Trinket, be careful, this thing was made for you. No, no, be careful! Spit on it! Can he spit? Can Trinket spit? Can I grab a stick and lift the edge of the mat up? It's still there. Maybe when we leave, we can crash it down. I want to use a stick, and oh! Here, Scanlan, you were going to knock. So that you don't have to touch the door in case it's magic. I'm glad he didn't murder us with his bear traps. I think so. (sing-songy) We could give you some interesting conversation. 35 years is a very long time. What is an old gnome song? Pike? Do you think maybe a Greater Restoration is in order? No reason. That's like me! That's exactly like me. (whispering) Give him some ale. You don't know. Bet it's been a while since he's had some of that. To find a very ancient goddess-- Sprigg, it is quite powerful, yes, but also maybe slightly dangerous. You're not alone at the moment. This is very true. And I'd rather not put my life in the hands of you, not knowing you very well. Yes. So something bad could happen, and you'd run away, and we'd be stuck here? Because of Ioun? Some of us are champions. Some of them don't like them. Some of them worship them but don't really get respect. What's yours? So you're a champion? Are you a champion of Ioun? No, no, I think we should save it. He took the stone! Are you taking the stone? Trinket starts chasing the imp around the room. Unless they're boots. And then they're amazing. I am for them, usually. Have you any idea where the key to Ioun is? Yes. Boots that hold a key to Ioun's location. Specifically. But she could be tangible if you'd help us find her. How many fucking bolts are there? Whoa, cool! Oh, I can't see inside of it. Trinket! Where's the imp? Where is the front door? I know, these trees are a pain in our butts. Oh no. Should somebody roll for Pike? 13. Quidd. Dicks. Well, we've got healers. 24. What did she get? Well, no, but Sprigg is right after Scanlan. He's before we are. So I'd rather get him up before. (sarcastically) I'm so glad he got those boots back, I'm just so glad. That's good, they're at disadvantage, now, to hit you. They are! Because you're prone. I know, right? I'm going to run over to the window that those guys disappeared from. Right there, yeah. Can I see that motherfucker? Did I see him run past the window? All right, then I'm going to shoot at him. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him! Trinket doesn't have enough movement to get over by him, does he? I'm going to attack him with my Bramble Shot. With the Blazing Bowstring. Ooh, yeah. That's a 31. Yes! Okay! Do I get sneak attack on him? I don't, do I? Damn! At least I got Hunter's Mark. Okay. Okay, 28 plus my 4d8 piercing damage. That's balls. Seven, nine, plus nine is 37. 37 points of damage. Does he roll a DC of over 17? A strength save? Nice. Then I am going to shoot him. Oh, wait! I didn't add my Blazing Bowstring damage. Eight more for the Blazing Bowstring. And then I'm going to shoot him again. I'm just asking do you get sneak attack damage if they're restrained? That's okay. Eight plus 14 is what? 32? Oh gosh! Okay! Ten, 11, 12, 13, plus sneak attack. 13. What's that? Ten. So 23. And then Hunter's Mark. Plus one. 24. I'm going to step away from the window. No, against the wall. Trinket is going to run over to Sprigg and Scanlan. Just to the guy. Just try to growl at him and scare him because he can't attack him. What about the magician guy? Did you know that I was shooting at somebody? Let's try to save those books before they all burn. Is she doing it to the magician? Oh no, all of his stuff! Oh, really? I didn't realize it was that big. 28 hits. 22 hits. Halved. Okay, so 11 plus six is 27 points. At the necromancer? You get a grit point back, you get a grit point back! Well, then you're welcome. 14. Psychic damage. 4d8? You only got 16 on 4d8? That's in the new campaign guide. Super disadvantage. Only when you're stuck under a tree on fire. I'm going to Hunter's Mark the big undead monster in the room. And then I'm going to shoot him! With the Blazing Bowstring! Oh, but I'm going to use the sharpshooter thing. Which I don't know if I should have done that on this particular one. It was 17 to hit. Five plus eight is 13. Plus sneak attack, because he's got Trinket next to him. 13, 18, 23, sorry! 23 and then lightning damage. 24. 25, 26. And then Blazing Bowstring. God dang! 27. I'm going to move forward. I'm going to actually move toward the corner where Keyleth is. Oh, there is? I'm going to step on him. Oh, wow. He hits me. Probably because I stepped on him. (pain sound) Fuck. Ah, shit. Okay, I'm going to hit the big hulking thing again. Oh, okay, well, yeah. I'm going to do the same thing with the big hulking guy. 25 to hit. Oh, I didn't add plus ten to the previous one! Thanks! 14. 14 plus six is 20. I think that's just 32 because I don't get sneak attack again. I guess so. But she doesn't have to. Hasted action. Thanks, Pike. It's not a big deal, you guys. I'm going to have nightmares about that. Oh, Grog, put him out! Fire's out, I'm assuming. What about the books? Can I go over to them and see if I can find some books I think Percy would like? 27. But how? Was he watching us? Is he scrying on us? Oh, he's fucking scrying on us. I lean out the window. Hey, Sprigg! Hi. I do. Come in here, I'll take them off your hands. I'll cure you, darling. Don't worry. But he's one of those creepy ghouls that probably doesn't speak. Me and Pike can heal him as I take the arrows out. (sarcastic laugh) Sprigg, anything valuable in here that you want to save before we get you out of here? Yes. No keys to Ioun? You know where she is? I hope so, too. I cast Cure Wounds. You healed 19, by the way. Trinket sits down next to him and stares, but I'll turn around. I'm leaning against the wall and staring at him now. Is you? It is you. So do you glow brighter the closer we get? What's the deal here? I think it's glown. What if he's a tuning fork? That's what I mean. What, no? This is good! I guess so. Is there enough of us? Trinket, in the necklace. Quick! See? All that fucking shit was for nothing! He's still alive! Feels pretty good, doesn't it? I give him a kiss. Wait, what? It's skin books? I can't read that, dear. We should maybe find Ioun, don't you think? Is Sprigg still glowing? I wonder if we could follow the glow. Warmer? I'm going to walk with Percy. Oh, and Trinket's out. I know. I know, dear. He heard? Wait. Who did you tell? Percival, who did you tell? What? (screams) No! Percy! A bit vague? Scanlan, what did he say? Why is that bad? Why was that angry? Oh. I feel like Pike would've comforted him. Hi. How's it going? It's so hot in here. It's very hot in here. No, it very much is. I'm very glad. I'm just surprised he didn't say anything. I spoke with him. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about that. Engagement. But you know. We got married. (weakly) Celebration! Thank you, Scanlan. None of us have forgotten.
