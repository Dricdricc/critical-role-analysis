Don't say that. Amazing. We're making a cameo appearance in Rat Queens, you guys! I chose My Friend's Place, which is an awesome, very similar to Taliesin's, it's an awesome place for teenagers that are runaways or living on the streets. It gives them a place that they can crash and really help get their stuff together. Yes, continually. Oh, they really do, that is a really good place. Oh, that was a good roll. See? I rolled five natural 20s before the show even started. So it's all going to be terrible. No, I just have to figure out which ones I want to use that night. I know, and they're all useful. No, I've got six out here. Little strange. We're off to a good start tonight, guys. Well, that's because we don't have anything, because Scanlan's troupe stole everything anyway. Insight check? Do we have anything that can sense people's alignment? This is terrible, what is happening? I'm on it. See, this is why I shouldn't have this many dice, because I don't know what to choose. Okay. 21. 21. Gross. Yeah, we need to get him settled in, make sure he's all right. Yes. Actually, Garthok. Garthok is waiting for us down in those, so we can go look at the Clasp and talk to them and everything, because he's told them we're on our way. What? Why? What did I do? So many things. You didn't think you could mention this? All the times we've dealt with the Clasp? You didn't think it was worth mentioning that I almost died? We've been down there to talk. That's why you don't keep secrets. In all experience, let's be honest. You need Keyleth. Unless they don't know about the stone and the only one with the stone-- Oh, good. Because I would like to check in to Vasselheim as well. You know, there is the Slayer's Take. Well, there's metallic dragons. Well, it's an organization made to hunt massive creatures, isn't it? Yes, but-- If everything else is under attack, Vasselheim is inevitable. For a time. That's good. It's all over the water. Maybe the dragons haven't gone that far. Mostly to see, you know. Come on. Don't say that. Millions. It's very large. Any kind of advantage on that? For growing up there or something? Eight. Great. (laughs cynically) At least he's safe. Wow. Wow. Hit after hit after hit today, Taliesin. Can we relocate all of the refugees staying in our walls? Can we bring everyone through the Sun Tree? Keyleth? How long does it stay open? But we can at least get these people out. An airship sounds wonderful, Percy, but-- One dragon attacking it and it's down. You keep thinking, there. Wonderful. We get the refugees out, we go to Whitestone, we talk to them there, we use the Misty Walk thingy and go to Vasselheim, talk to the Slayer's Take. This is perfect. Problem-- Do we need a ship right now, darling? I understand the joy in it. -- believe a dragon wouldn't notice a giant airship flying out of the city? We need to talk to the Clasp first. Plus Allura and Drake are coming back. We need to talk to them as well. Find out what's going on in Westrunn. And then we need to get everyone out. I've got a plan. Here's a good plan. This is a good plan, though. Open up the tree. Send a bunch of refugees through. Shove them through as fast as possible. Percy. You go with them. We keep the stone. You go through. You talk to your sister. You bamf back with the stone. And then we talk to the Clasp together. No, we're going to wait for you. So can we get the refugees together? Well, we comfort them and tell them all right, obviously Emon is not a safe place to be right now. It's dangerous, and we want to keep all of you as safe as possible. We have a plan. We're going to take those of you who need the most attention first, and we're going to bring you to Whitestone, which is a city that has not been affected by dragons at all. It has much need of people who can do an honest day's labor, and you can earn a wage and find a living there, for the time being, and if at some point in time you want to come back to Emon when all of this is done, of course you're more than welcome to. I'm rolling the gold one! 20? In the winter. Then it could be a little chilly! I like that we're sending to them to the place that's got the orb of death. I said, "You might be able to see your breath!" Percy-- stone. To go through the-- Oh, okay. Well I assume, as soon as we see it start to shrink, we stop! We cut off the line. Anybody with children. How many children are here? Children with their moms go-- and families go first. All right, those people first! Oh! Good call, okay! So the injured can stay. What!? Okay. So not the injured. Families first. How about that? As soon as we see it start to shrink, I'll hold the people back. So Percy, you're first, everybody follow through. So any families here? Families? Are you really respons-- I can tell when you're lying, sir. Are you responsible for that child? 26! Child, where's your parents? Do you have one? Oh, dear. Okay. Then you would stay and wait for your family, potentially? That can move. Here we go. That's good! That's a good amount! And then, any other like single people that can move fast? Get ready to run, people. Everybody comfortable with the plan? You count in your head, Grog. We put blankets on everybody, right? (whispering) Eskil Ryndarien! More food for you guys, which is A+. Hey! They work! That's wonderful. And you told them to make preparations in case something happens? They need to start hiding food. Anything touching it disintegrates. How would you turn it to a projectile-- are you okay, Keyleth? One plus two plus one plus one! Well that's good, because it cancels out any magic-- I've been down there several times without knowing that. Maybe I can become a member. Taking the tunnel, we're taking the secret entrance-- Garthok showed us the secret entrance, he's waiting for us and having them prepare our way, this could get bad. Oh! That! Yes. Cool. We're taking our secret tunnel into the city. What else are we going to do? How you doing there? You okay? In your pants. Cast Pass Without a Trace on us. Aw, it fell out of my hand. I don't think it should count if it fell. Aw, that's mean. Oh, I get advantage! Trinket is staying with Pike. Oh! He's crying! I'm crying. As a dragon-favored enemy, could I guesstimate what those winged creatures are that would hang out around dragons? Ah-ha! The creature? Those are the things that attacked the airship! I think you should turn it into a bunny, Keyleth! Turn it into a bunny. 18. Shit. Oh, right, right, right. There's so many things! Oh no! Why didn't I bring Trinket? I thought this was a stealthing mission! Oh, I think Grog was before me. Oh my gosh! He's so strong from the last game. You didn't rage yet? Is there anywhere I can stand that I get a good cone shape? Or am I all blocked in? Okay, how high is the roof next to me? Could I acrobatics that shit up? Okay. Hold on. Oh! 31? Oh, okay. Then I'm going to Hunter's Mark the magic user. And I'm going to Conjure Barrage in a cone to get as many of those fucks as I can. Yeah, sure. Sorry, Scanlan. 3d8. It's not that much. 16, and then an extra d6 on that guy. An extra six. Yes, it does. Come on, Scanlan. Can you Dominate the beast? No. because he rolled a one, remember? Yeah-- (laughs) Keyleth. Shit! (laughs) They're an army. Wow, wow. Wow. Oh my god. Grog. Oh no, Scanlan! Me? 52 points of damage just then? No, Scanlan! 52! You have three points left. That's okay. The other wyvern is still mad at the first one, so that's good. Oh man. Okay. Yeah. Scanlan! I got you! I shoot from my Bow of the Sky Sentinel. Fuck. I did, but I only used my burning thingy once, so I can do that. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. So I'm going to move my Hunter's Mark to one of the guys around Scanlan. Yeah, sure. Or the least wounded of them, actually. Okay. And then I'm going to shoot-- I'm going to shoot arrows. All right. I'm going to shoot through my Blazing Bowstring on that guy and the guy in front of him. Yeah. Okay. So I forget how to do that. I roll to attack. Why is this so hard?! Okay, 18! Okay, I'm going to roll damage on that one, which is ten plus my normal eight. 12, 14 plus six for Hunter's Mark. 20 plus six for sneak attack, bitch! No, I was calling that guy a bitch. 6d6. So that's 25 damage against the first guy. Yay! Okay, so the second guy is another 18. Actually no, that's a 20-whatever. Yeah. Okay. 14, 15, 16. Do I get sneak attack on him, too? Dang it. So 16 damage against that guy. I'm going to-- yeah. Take a potion! Heal yourself! Oh my god, that guy is going to be so-- Nice. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the one fighting-- Yeah. Percy. And I'm going to first attack the one fighting Grog. 16? Yes! Okay. 17 plus sneak attack-- 18. And I shift my attention over to the one fighting Percy! And that is 30, no, 28? Nine, ten, 11-- Where's my dex? 17. I'm staying where I am! Actually, I'm going to jump off the roof and rush over to Scanlan. 24? Yeah. Oh no, dice down! Next time, stealth. We should get inside. We should hide. Good call. If you can do this quickly, Keyleth, because we need to hide these bodies. Let's get them inside. No, we've got to get the wyverns inside. If anything flying overhead sees these bodies, they know something's been attacked. I'll have the bag. Just the Dust of Tracelessness. I start putting the Dust of Tracelessness down on the ground so it looks like nobody's been here. Is it good for you? Should we take a short rest, though, before we head down to the Clasp? Because some of us have taken some hits-- Okay. Before we head down? This is why I left Trinket. Because he wouldn't have been able to come down here anyway. Just so you know. Oh. I'll heal you. I'm going to heal you-- You don't have the-- the rock doesn't work until we sleep. You don't have anything. You're better at talking than the rest of us are? How will I know if you get into trouble, and your hands are tied-- We can all hear you. (laughter) Hold on just a moment. Mind the gap. Eugh, fuck, it smells down here. Do I have to step in the water? Yes? Stalked? What? And said it was me? No-- A stick. Of human tongues. What the fuck? Okay, I will do that, I want to know that tongue guy, that looks like me-- is he dead or is he alive now? They gave him to some stalker, some stalker! So there could be at this moment in time another person that looks just like me parading around the world? Well, thank you. For, you know, doing that-- (nervous laugh) Was it the Clasp here, was it the Clasp in Westruun? Well, these guys probably don't know me. I'll put my hood up-- I would like to find out who the guy was that wanted me, though. That's kind of weird. Thank you. For everything. thank you. You always have my back and I know it. And for that, I won't say very much. Everyone can come down. I'm guessing towards the light, is where they are. Scanlan? Do you have something that can make disguises? Don't you have like, not the mustache, but something that can really change my looks? Could I use that? Oh, it takes like a little bit? Or just me. How about just me? I've got a question, though. Here's the thing if you think that they know what I look like, don't you think they know what you look like? Because you look just like me. So what difference does it make if I'm there or not? All right, all right, all right. Seeming, how about that? Okay! Seeming? Please? Scanlan, what if I heal you? How about a limerick as payment, Scanlan? For you. I'll give you a limerick. Hold on. I've been preparing it-- Have you heard tale of Scanlan the Bard? / Or Burt Reynolds, if you look at his card. Always tries to get laid / Sometimes with ladies he made! But I still respect him, 'cause rhyming is hard. (laughter, cheering) Yay! Oh, thanks, Scanlan. I take off my circlet, I guess, and I put on the hat. Let's go towards-- Can I look, too? Oh, he doesn't need my help. And Vasselheim. There's no guarantees you'll be able to get in anywhere. It is. But the sooner these dragons are defeated, the sooner business can get back to usual. Ow. I mean-- (fake coughs) eh. Don't say that. But I don't want to introduce them to Vasselheim, no. We're already here, Keyleth. Can I join in? 33. I turn my back to him and I say, he can read our lips as well as I can. I don't think they'd listen to us anyway, honestly. Offering to sweeten the pot-- we're defeating a fucking dragon! Let them get back to normal. We could say-- They certainly can't do it without us. And we can't do it without them. But we'll be bringing in other armies with us. Who would we even introduce you to? And we gave you something very powerful in exchange. Don't do it. We'll just back up. I do not turn my back. I walk backwards the entire way out, with an arrow notched. Keyleth? Darling? Could you maybe make a wall of stone and close off this tunnel? This mark. Is it magic? Can they trace you through this mark? Of course. Similar to when you hit me in my arm. Straight up-- That's deep, Grog. I like it. I cast Cure Wounds on-- I already did it. Too late! I fucking touched you, fucker. It just takes the pain away. Can we go back to the keep? Stealth check. Pass Without a Trace. Then what's the point of anybody rolling? 37. Add ten. Nice. We need to sleep. We need to get up in the morning-- I think we need to go to Vasselheim or Whitestone. No, we don't. But we also need to find out what's happening with Allura in Whiterun. Westruun. All those cities. That's wonderful. You going to sleep, Grog? Bow-chicka-wow-wow! I give Scanlan the Hat of Disguise back. Yeah, fuck 'em. I take his face and I push him down on the ground. Do we have a plan? Yeah. We need to go to Whitestone, then. Yeah, let's do that. Wait. All of our guards, and our servants, as well. I don't want to leave everyone here. I don't know what else to do. If dragons attack, our five guards aren't going to be able to do anything. We find a new keep. I guess we should go tell the guards that they probably will have to leave, if they want. Well, I don't want to force them to, but of course they're welcome to. All right. He's the captain of the guards, anyway. I leave a note for Allura, and tell her we've headed to Whitestone, as well. I don't say Whitestone. I say, "the place where we sent you originally," so she knows where it is. Not yet, Keyleth! I mean, it's the first time we've had a home in forever, and we're leaving it. We can go. It's nothing. It's just stone. Let's go. Yeah, buy as much as we can. Buy stuff in Vasselheim. I mean, I'm not going to say no to the gold. So very generous of you. I like it. Of course. Yeah, teleport, right? Just pop on over, yeah. We sleep for the night, and then we go over to Vasselheim the next day. Hang out in Whitestone for the day. What? Okay. I mean, it's your city. And I love you for it. No magic in the city, remember? Oh, is there a teleportation circle? Do we have one in Whitestone? We always have rooms at Slayer's Take, remember. Is Gilmore staying here in Whitestone? Yes? No, it makes sense to leave him here, right? Where do you want to stay, Gilmore? Understandable. You've got a whole bookstore devoted to you here. All right, cool. Slayer's Take business. We'll keep moving. Don't worry. We took care of it. Yeah, let's go post up. Her home. Just to let them know we're here and we need some rooms. (laughs) Oi! It has. Hi. Dragons? Have you heard about anything? We're going to need rooms. Your wife. That's his wife. Oh. Healthy. Is Zahra around? That's wonderful. Well, settle in? (whispering) Aldor. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if Kashaw is still here. Oh! Right, Keyleth? The guy that kissed you. He was very handsome. It's morning, still. Maybe Nessa and Zahra have seen him. We could find out. We could use another healer, always. Pike, speaking of clerics, do you want to check in with your temple? Oh. She didn't even come to Vasselheim? Yeah, we probably should leave the stone with her so she can pop in with us. Shut up! Trinket is right here, right now! He has been quiet, because he's really well-behaved. So stealthy, darling. I'm afraid to start anything. It's 1100. Oh, okay. I want to wait and talk to Zahra. Right? But I do want to buy potions, as well, and stock up. What? I'm going to stock up on a bunch of stuff. Yeah, we did, and it's sad. We can't help it from there. We have to go somewhere else in order to come back to it. Let it go. Don't say that.
