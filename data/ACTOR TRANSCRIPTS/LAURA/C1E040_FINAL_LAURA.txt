Well, we'll celebrate 50th like a motha. So this is the last episode, you guys. Hope you've had fun. Oh my gosh, will our 50th time up with our year? We got to figure this math out. Oh, what's the name of that? Oh yeah, Lego Marvel Avengers. What? That's amazing. You should go to there. I bought a Millennium Falcon cookie when I was there. I know. 43, but if we can take a short rest, we can roll some dice. We don't need them running out. Send them below. If we need to, we can bring them through the portal into Whitestone. Everybody but Scanlan. Yeah, yeah, we see them. Maybe the cathedral? Inside, now! I start to grab people arms and pulling them through and helping people get through safely. All right. I run up. Jesus. Yeah, where's the cathedral at? Is that what the other entry is? There's more on the outside there? Is that what you're putting there? 15. Don't be real dumb because I'm standing next to you. Oh jeez. We'll just have Riskel fix it-- Oh, wait. Oh, okay. Well, good. That's it? Because it's all covered in fog? 15. Trinket is unconscious. I can't see it? Wouldn't I still be in the fog cloud if I was on the ground? So I can use my movement to jump down? All right, I'm going to fucking Hunter's Mark him. I'm going to jump fucking down on the ground. 14. Okay, I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. And I'm going to shoot him through the Sky Sentinel. On the worm. And I multiclassed today, so I'm a rogue, so I get Sneak Attack on this. Does it know that-- does it see me? Never fucking mind. Balls, all kind of balls around here right now. The first attack is 25. The second attack is 24. The third attack is 16. Okay, so. Let me double-check. An extra d6 for those two. 15 plus seven is what? 22 on the first arrow. 15 plus four is 19 on the second arrow. I'm a little upset right now. And then I'm going to shoot the third arrow through the Blazing Bowstring. I mean my second attack. And that doesn't hit him, so. Good times. I did. Can I-- No. Is it possible to get inside the door? The door that I'm right there-- If I backed up into the door? Yeah, I want to be ducked around a wall, if I can, on the inside of the door. Yes. What is he doing? Thank you guys. I don't think Vex even saw any of that, like Vex doesn't even know he was unconscious. Sick, Percy. I like it, I like it. Yeah! Does the door actually open on it? Heh, that's so cool. That eagle is weally weally close to that dwagon. Eight for me. And 19 for Trinket. Man, I wish we would've a Fancy Feast. What is it really called? Fancy Feast is way better. Wait, that was against Grog? So wait, so Pike was the one that took those huge hits? (gasps) Are you okay, Pike? Are you okay? "One second, let me check." Is it ancient? My turn? I'm feared. Okay, then I'm going to use my bonus round to hide. Stealth. 23. We're stuck where we are because we can't run closer to it. I did, and it was 23. Oh! It's disadvantage, but I had advantage. Even. I don't remember what the first-- Should I reroll it? Okay, I guess I'll try to shoot it, then. Okay. Oh okay so-- That was good, that was good, 26. With disadvantage. Okay, so I'll do the first one right now. 22. Because I got Sneak Attack, right, because I'm hiding? Okay, so 23 was the damage on the first arrow. Now, the second one I don't think hits, it was like an 18. I duck back behind the wall. Okay, and I want to send Trinket into the keep, if he can make it. Is that, should I send Trinket into the keep? Balls, what? Really? Ah Jesus, it hits, come on. All right. He's fine. Bear-ly. Yeah. Okay, so is it wisdom? Ooh, 17, 18, 19! I'm not afraid anymore, you hear that? Pike, get out of there! Pike gets one, too. Kill him. Kill him with Craven Edge! Disadvantage. Oh jeez, don't attack the crowd. So how much bigger is Vorugal, like is he--? Holy crap! Can we heal the frozen people? Is it possible? Yeah, sure. Two. Can I find Erwen? Yeah, I go and find him and tell him to start setting up as many beds as he can, as many in the cathedral that we have to-- In the chapel. To maybe give some of these people places to stay for the time being. Everything's gone. Please do. Simple food. Fruit, anything. Nobody is in the workshop yet. That's pretty sick. I'm busying myself trying to bandage any of the survivors that seem injured. Do you think this is what-- Do you think this is what Mother saw before she died? I won't, I swear. He's a dick. Hey, check out those Critical Role shirts on Geekandsundry.com. They sure are lovely. I know, can't hear it? Ugh, what is he saying? Oh my god. None taken. I go and help other people and call to Trinket to carry over some bandages for me. I Hunter's Mark Grog as he walks away. I don't know. I just do. Fucking A! 15. Aw, you know what? I haven't chosen my fucking rogue ability yet, my rogue proficiency. Too late now. I'm choosing my dice. Okay, okay, okay. I get advantage on all stealth checks? 24. Jeez Louise. Is the food here? That's really appropriate. I'm knocking on the door. Are you in there? I open the door. Well, what's this big master plan you're all plotting? Did I notice that, I have a really good passive perception? This is about the skull, then? Oh shit. Can I insight check them to see who is fucking with who-- -- and who has better intentions right now? Double insight check? Okay, the gold one is for Percy, and the thorny one is for Grog. Whoa! Good for both of them, motherfucker! The gold one is a 27 for Percy and-- 15 plus eight, what is 15 plus eight? 23 for Grog. No, but one of them is 27 and 23. Both of them? Seriously, Matt? What the fuck? What the fuck is going on?! What fucking friend and-- I saw you, Percival. Who's your friend? It specifically wants Percy? Percy? How about you guys give me the skull, I'm not even touched by anything dark. Oh god. I'm going to get fucking attacked by Grog. I'm going to back up into a corner and hold on to it and look down at it. I'm holding onto it? Jesus. I think this is probably the stupidest thing, why did I decide to hold it? I don't want either of you to have it. I take the tapestry off it and I ask it, what the fuck do you want? What the fuck are you? What the fuck is this? Are you Vecna? Can I insight check the fucking thing in the eyeball? Sure, no problem. Unless it was a natural 20, it doesn't matter, 15, no. No. Way higher than 15, 21. 22, I can add. Why would we free it? Do I roll anything? Can I do anything? So this is a surprise attack. Ugh, that's lame. That was just 13. Are you close enough? I backed into a corner. Do you think you can just grab it from me? Are you going to try to pull me out of the way or just the fucking skull, you dick? From me? He really, really doesn't. Ah, that's terrible-- nine. It's my turn? I rolled a 13. I reach up and I touch his back. And I say are you yourself? Yes, you, fuck! I back up into a corner, and I say what is all this about? Why do you even need this? Why do we want to set it free? I don't understand. "I'm right here, Matt." Oh jeez, oh come on. There's no way, even if I roll like a-- Unless I get a 20. No, that's 14. You're just going to-- Yes. (laughter) I run and jump for it. 23. That was all of it? Can I run out of the room? If I can move. I'm going to run towards the door. I'm out of the room, you can't see me. No, just me. Yeah, you fucks are still mobile. 21. So we're right up the hallway from our prison cell, right? Keyleth, you don't know what's happening. I tuck it behind my back. What? What kind of guests? What does she look like? It kind of is. Yes-- Erwen. Bring them down here. It's an emergency As quickly as possible. Not yet, darling. We could use your help at this moment. Is he good? A good person? That's a weapon. Not at all. We're grateful for your help. Not yet, not yet. Four. Ancient. Dragons. We're sorry. Unfortunately, Allura, all of that is the reason for our current impasse. We seem to have discovered something that could potentially reverse the situation. But there's a great price to pay. It could be a small price to pay, we don't know. If you wouldn't mind taking a look at this relic that we discovered. I don't give it to her, but I pull the tapestry off of the skull and show it to her. Okay. He can grant a wish, he says? Lying, truth? What do you think? Right. No, but I remember this, we dealt with this with the demon that killed Pike. And it had to be so carefully worded. A green, a black, a white. They're definitely working together. He said if we fight or flee, we'll be denied the mercy. He said our new purpose is to serve him. It couldn't have been. Would a dragon seek vengeance against one of their brethren killed? All right. Krieg was a dragon, Allura. He attacked us. It was right after we got to Emon. Yeah. Oh, I can sense them. Right. Yeah. He's here. Do I sense any others? They're gone for the time being. We don't know anything. Everyone was dying around us, we made it to the keep. They want to be gods. We can bring them here. We will. So we're definitely not going to wish on this skull then, yeah? Fucking A! What in the hell. That's the first time we've ever ended on time. Oh jeez. (cheering) Everything. It all would have gone to hell if-- There's got to be other ones. It was really cool with green. Thanks for joining us, you guys.
