No! We've been listening in the car. Yeah. No, diamonds are Vex's best friend. Ooh! I'm cleaning my nails as I'm watching her. Make sure no lights are lit in our-- Okay. You got it, Keyleth. Oh, no. That's right in front of-- I pull out my cloaks in my bag and start trying to put out the flames. Keyleth, what? Was that supposed to happen? Is that good? Was this good? Should I stop? I keep putting out the flames. They're sucking the life force out of the earth. Oh, my god, what if the vampire thing is right underneath us? Can I use my Primeval Awareness and sense any sort of vampiric presence within our very close vicinity? It's a minute. It's up to six miles if I spend six minutes. (whispering) That's good. Bad. Probably bad. We're just going to sleep? Surrounded by vampires, we're just going to sleep surrounded by lots and lots of vampires? You even did that awesome fire thing at the end that was really, really cool. Really? Nice, Scanlan. Where is he at? Oh, this is messed up. 23. Oh. He could be evil. We could turn evil here! Keyleth. Oh wait. Seeming has ended at this point, hasn't it? So, Trinket is a bear. Okay, cool. Yeah. I've been laying on him all night. That's why it smells like it does. Grog! I have a bear. Do you want to disguise the bear? In the house. All right. I want like a crazy eye in my Seeming. Yeah, secret doors? Can I use a perception check to see if there's any kind of secret entrances in the rubble at all? Something that leads to a cellar? I'll just old lady walk into the building and look around. Yeah, she does. This crazy-eyed old lady does. I'm looking, boy. Ooh, with no advantage, right? That would have been an eight. I can't see any kind of like door that leads to a cellar? All right. No yo-yos here, boy. But it's half-collapsed, it would not be very protected. What if we went to the fields and we asked other peasants how we report to what's-his-fuck. Keron. Keron? Kerrion? So, just bust on in and kill them right now. Yeah, you look a little pale, Percy. Are you sick? Does Keyleth need to cast, I don't know, Restoration on you or something? Be killed? Never pop back out again. We saw the tree. I'm going to come with you. Kerrion? Kerrion? We're new to town. I smack him on the back of the head and say Let's go boy! Keep up! Can we insight check him to see if it seems like he's changed at all, or if he's still that same douchebag or if he's-- To the house? The Countess. And she was which? Who was the Countess again? Oh, she is the one! Can I go up and ask Keyleth, outside of his earshot, to maybe cast some sort of restoration on him, without-- He's fighting it. I don't think he's feeling well. Can you heal him? He looks cold and kind of slimy, and he's coughing a lot. I know. No, that's true. All right. Nobody will know, right? Let's do it! What? Oh no. Let's do it! Yeah. I put a couple arrows in the holy oil that we have. Oh, can I just dip one arrow in, then, right now? 24. Probably. I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. Is it possible to see what the movement is, who it is inside that window? Is the cellar door hidden from view of everything or is it out in the open? The cellar door that we saw. Does it look like anybody can see us? They can't even see us, though! Let's just up and over the bar, athletic it. Acrobatics it? Fuck! Wrap your hands. Well, we're in the back of the house. We're stealthing. 32. Up against the wall of the building. I feel like it's been a while since you've done this. Lockpicking. Could I stealth in a couple of steps look around and see if there's anybody in there, or hear anything? 19. It's clear, let's go! Ish! I wonder if they're going to notice that fence. I got up to it and listen. I don't hear anything, you guys. I think it's fine! Yeah! Your ears are huge compared to mine! There's nothing there! That's awesome. Yep, rogues are awesome. They might be close. Wait, before we do this. Keyleth, can you maybe make the gate outside not look like it's all bent to shit? Yeah. Oh. Wait, no. Plus ten because Pass Without a Trace. Hold. Okay. I start climbing the-- Grog up before me. Plus ten! Plus ten! 34. Grog first. Just run in, surprise him. Really? Really?! I'm offended. And I'm hurt. I give you the worst evil eye I've ever given anyone. I smack the back of your head again. And it's hard because I'm angry right now. Yeah, I want to stealth in behind Grog after they go into the room. (sing with the battle music) Whoa! Look at you, Scanlan! 13. That's all of us. What does Grog look like? 23. No, you're right. Can I go first so I don't do any damage to you guys if you guys go in? I want to go in, peek my head in and shoot-- first, I'm going to shoot from my Longbow of Sky Sentinel. And I'm going to use-- it turns into three arrows for one of my attacks, so it's three more attacks, potentially? Okay! I'm going to do that! I'm going to attack him, the guy. The bad guy. The one that's in charge. Kerrion. Yeah! 28. Okay, so I make an attack for all three arrows. Oh, that one doesn't hit. Well, probably not. 13? 18? Jeez Louise, what a waste of a storm arrow. Yes. That was the wrong thing. I can't; I'm going to Hunter's Mark him after this first one because it's a bonus action. What am I doing? 14, 15, 16, and then plus another d6, so it's basically like Hunter's Mark, right? 19 is the first one. And then I attack again. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him now. Can I do that? 29. I'm so confused right now. I know. 14 on the second one. I totally shit the bed on that one, guys, and I apologize. I had things I wanted to do. That's right, boy! Huh? Oh, just right inside the door. Can I say I peeked in to shoot and then went back around the side of the door? Yeah. It's Ripley that's doing the guns! Oh no! He's calling in backup. I'm picturing him as what's-his-name in-- Yeah! Yeah. He has magic?! But Mr. Filch doesn't have magic. He's a squib! Squibs can't do magic. Yay! Yeah. All right, so I go in the room. Yeah, I stay in the doorway. Actually no, I back-- well. Yeah, I'm staying right there. I can't see; is there a soldier right there next to the invisible guys, or is it just the invisible guys? Actually, I'm going to do Lightning Arrow because that gets everything within ten feet. I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on the soldier on the ground. The one that Keyleth's attacking. Can I move to a place where I get it? Awesome. Let's do it from there. Nice. 27. Okay, so that is 4d8 damage to him. And then anything within ten feet has to make a dex save. Yeah, that's everything within ten feet. 19 to little prone soldier. To the little prone guy? Anybody within radius takes 1d8 if they make the save and then 2d8 if they fail. One. Oh. Yeah. Does the Hunter's Mark damage him, the invisible guy, still, if he gets hit with anything? Or is it just if I attack him with an arrow? Okay. This is confusing! Actually that's 30. This is disgusting. Doesn't the guard get a-- Yeah! With your fire hands? I want to loot the bodies. I'm keeping a very strong eye on Percy right now. Yeah, tell him to go sit in a corner, Scanlan. Oh, this is so wrong. Oh, terrible. No, this is so wrong. Just knock him out. What are we going to ask him? Okay. Where are the Briarwoods? Are the Briarwoods-- This is really smart. I feel good about this. No. Do they know we're here? Yeah. Do you know where they are? Yeah. Oh, now I feel bad. It's not guarded? What is the project room? Is it hard to talk with no teeth? Do you know what they've done to the ground here? Do you know why nothing grows? I just want to ask, when do the Briarwoods come out? We can't stay the night. I feel like it's a little stupid, since we have nowhere to go. I'm fully in support with burning down a house, I just feel like it might backfire a bit. Hey, buddy. How's it going? Soon, but not now. Let's go. Let's do it. Are we? I open up a bottle of wine and take a giant swig. Yeah. Hey, buddy. Let's go. Running toward the woods? Where are we running? They're going to notice-- I don't. I mean, I can cast it right now. Yeah. 24. Pass Without a Trace, I mean, Dust of Tracelessness. That was dark, you guys. Super dark. Hey, man. Did we hit 10k? Oh, I like Freddie Mercury.
