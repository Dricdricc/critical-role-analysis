We love you, Yev! It looks like your tiny little weenus is-- Wait. Can I say, Yev, about the stuff? All the little pictures you see in the different videos, he's giving some of those away tonight? Giving some away! If you sign up for Backblaze or if you have signed up for Backblaze already, you're entered into the competition. And then you can win them, and we've signed them, and it's wonderful. Did I say it right? Okay. Cool. That's a good question. I have no idea what's in the store tonight. I have no sheet in front of me, and I have no idea what's there. I think there's some hats left, I know there are some hats-- No, they did not. No, the dice did not get restocked, the dice are coming back in, like, January, so there's a lot more coming in January, so that's good. I have no idea what else is in the store though. A hat? There's a hat. Shit, I got nothing. You guys, I'm focused on spells, and I'm focused on arrows, and hit points and-- (gasps) And the patches! And our mugs! There's still patches left, you guys! That's pretty cool! Yeah, the hats are still there. There's only a few left, though! There's only a few hats left, I know that for sure. Sorry. I'm stressed! We're Jaegering. I take fire resistance. But you know they only last for one minute each. Just wait for like a second. Just wait. Fire resistance lasts for a while, I passed them out, so if you've got them, take them. Oh, but he's got the armor-- Wow, just drinking a potion would make him notice us? I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us. It can't be vocal because it's Pass Without a Trace-- oh no, it's verbal. No, I don't do that! I don't know what those things mean! It's a whisper. Tell me it's a one! Tell me it's a one! He may have heard us, but now we've got plus ten stealth. Already!? Take your potions! Who's rolling for Pike? I don't think she has anything, so-- I'm freaking out, shit, I'm sorry, I thought I was helping. 13. Good. Oh, Pike didn't even get a chance to-- We did, we did have a Heroes' Feast. We're all immune to fear and poison still, we all have advantage on wisdom. Like, wisdom, or something. No surprise there. Piece of shit. Is he bigger than Huge? So it doesn't have any effect on him? Is he bigger than 300 feet? He doesn't even get damaged at all, though? I know how painful this is right now, Keyleth, but it looked really cool. Just run. Still, that's something! That's better than zero! No, no, not at all! We're very happy with that! Is there water all over the ground, though? I feel like, run, Marisha, 'cause the thing that Pike's going to do is-- Yeah, but just go. I'm sorry. I don't know how I just stole two pencils. Hit him, Gilmore! What level spell was that, Gilmore? No! Don't move! You made it! Did you roll for Pike? What did you roll? And then he's got disadvantage on something next, doesn't he? After you use Cutting Words? MATT and Sweet. 9d4? And then if we have fire resistance, then it-- But what if we rolled 28, did we make our save? 28? And Trinket and Pike both fail as well. Pike and Trinket. Takes the full 90-- Trinket is in my necklace. Again, already. So 23. 24. 23 or 24? Oh, that's right, Pike has-- I need to-- Doesn't that mean he gets advantage on his attacks against you? He's so big, though! Oh my god. What was the second attack? Cool! I click my Boots of Haste! With my full movement, can I get behind the wall up where Keyleth was headed? I want to stop in a place where I can attack before I finish my move. (slowly) Go fuck yourself! Okay. All right. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark. Then, for my first attack, I'm going to try a Bramble Shot. Yes! 30 on the first. I took the bracers off, right? Yes, I did. Okay. 15 plus two lightning damage plus two sneak attack and a Hunter's Mark. Ooh! 12 plus 4d8 for the Bramble Shot. 15. No. 13. 17. Oh. 16. That would have been amazing. Oh! That's right! And an additional d6 because he's a dragon, right? 2d6? Oh, just plus two. I thought it was a d6. Sorry. You're right, I think. No, it's fine. I'll look it up between. My next attack, I want to try one of my poisoned arrows. 27! Okay! 14 plus four lightning damage. Plus Hunter's Mark is another four. What is the poison? Do I do anything for the poison? MATT I am going to go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw for him. Which succeeds. So, yeah, he just resists the poison effects of the arrows. And that hits too! That's 31! 16 plus another four lightning damage! Plus Hunter's Mark, plus two plus two, because he is a dragon. But I didn't do plus two on the second one because I-- And then I finish my round of movement and I keep running behind the building. Yeah. Right there. I know. We're fucked. Oh, that's great. That's good. Okay, we're going to move to the corner of the building that she's standing in. Yes. She's going to, as a bonus action, cast Spiritual Weapon. At fifth level. And then she's also going to cast Beacon of Hope. So we should do Beacon of Hope and not do Spiritual Weapon because we want to do a higher Spiritual Weapon later? So anybody within 30 feet gets advantage on wisdom, which you already have, but you get advantage on death saving throws as well. --is any time you're healed, you're automatically healed to the max possible amount. And that's what you're healed for. No, this is a prep spell. This is something that probably we should have done before Thordak started attacking us. Should we have run around the corner? If we had run around the corner, would Grog get? Well, that's fine. And that gets Pike in that as well. Bonus action? Oh, that's right, Healing Word! Okay, so she should do a Healing Word. Is Healing Word a level two? Grog needs it? I feel like he's okay still, so Percy? At a level two, that's 2d4. Everybody. But she can't hide, though. No! Make sure he dies before he gets anything else. Moment of truth. Moment of truth. I can't tell what she's going to do. It should probably be like a black or a green or something that's like slimy. No. Double the dice. Did you add your plus ten, because it was Reckless? That's okay, that was a six. Oh my God, Matt. I'm impressed and terrified of you for having to keep track of this. I honestly had no idea what my hands were going to do. Get rid of them. He's probably got more than three. He's Thordak. Isn't that like if you forget to move or something, you don't get to do it later, if you forgot about it? No no no no, I was just joshing you! That's good. (whispers) Okay, that's good, that's good. 27. It's okay, I'm happy that he's here. That's right. Those robes are fabulous, Gilmore! Oh yeah. Oh no, this is the laughter we heard about. It drives you crazy. I cover my ears! We're all immune to fear. Yeah. Except for Jarett. Oh, good. Damn it! Can they fly? Do I get advantage because it's dragon-related? 16. Yes, the skyship! Me? Okay. Where can I go to where I can hit him? Is the fire elemental right next to me? Asshole. If I'm a third level rogue, do I get disengage? Okay, so for my bonus action I'll disengage. And then I'll move so I can hit Thordak. So can I move towards-- back towards the very back building? Can I get all the way there? Okay. So then I'm going to shoot him! Before I duck in around a corner or whatever. And I want to-- oh, that's 18. Yeah, it's pretty far. Okay. This next one. I'm going to use another poison arrow. Oh my God, I miss him again. Dice jail! Okay okay. Third attack. 25. Yay! One, that's one lightning, at 17 plus, Grog is standing next to him? Yeah, it's good. That's nine, 13. Plus 13. 14, 15, 16, 17 plus 13. Oh no, I hide behind that building. He's crazy as fuck. I guess so, I mean, I don't know what else I can do. Yeah! Oh, sweet. I whisper on the earring, that was my brother! That was my brother. Before all that, he knocks you unconscious. 22. He's got to roll under a four or lower to get-- It's possible! It's possible! These damn spells. Okay, Pike is going to run forward-- "Oh, Grog!" And she runs as far forward as she can. We're trying to get a little diagonal, she wants to be 60 feet away from him. Okay. Can she be at a diagonal so she's not lined up with Keyleth and Bigby? Okay. Then she casts Heal on Grog, which gives him 70 hit points, automatically healed. And that's a 6th-level spell, so she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon as a 5th-level spell as her bonus action. Oh, that's how it works. I thought it just had to be lower than-- Should we just do it? If she does it at a 2nd-level, then-- Yeah. Well yeah, but she's always going to be at a higher level than 2nd-level spells, so it doesn't matter. Okay, okay, okay. Wait-- okay, she can also do Mass Healing Word as a bonus action at-- never mind, that's a 3rd-level spell, so fuck it. She can do Healing Word, though! At second level. Should we do that? Who needs healing? She's going to do Healing Word on Grog again. Hey, Scanlan. (mimes playing a flute) So you can do something else! I know, his head is so high. How are you hitting Grog? That's Captain Damon, right? To the rescue! He's so fucking crazy. Does his head peek up above that? He's so tall. You don't know. Like, why would he add wyverns? For his own sake! Would the wings disperse the gas on the ground? Damn it. Oh, no! I am. I am very excited. 13d6. It was just covered. And it's being absorbed, so I'm not going to get it.LAURA,  Oh, no., SAM, SAM Plus 3d6 for your dragon. No, you didn't. There's no plastic big enough to support him! He's too fat to fly! Oh shit, he's high. Oh, my. There's rocks, it's on the rocks. Oh my god. Grog! He's too big to fly, we told you! It's all coming down. It's like he's going to knock over everything when comes down. Pike rolled a ten. Oh, wait, does she get-- Wait. No. Right when she needs it the most! (shriek) If we hadn't had that Heroes' Feast, Pike would be unconscious. Pike is way low. Wha-- why? But he's-- There's crystals in his belly. Okay. I'm going to shoot him. I'm going to reach back and I'm going to get a poison arrow. No, I've got six poison arrows. That one missed. Sorry! Poison arrow. No, it's okay, it's good. That is a 27. 15 plus four lightning. Does he have anybody near him? Does he see me? Am I sneak attacking? Plus four because that's two for being a dragon. Okay, so you know. And then the poison arrow thing. My last attack. I'm going to try using my last dragon-slaying arrow that I have. It's got Thordak's name on it. There's two? Why do I have two? Ooh! I rip it off and tuck it in my shirt. Pull. 21? No! Goddamn it. Is the building on fire? Can I use my bonus to hide? From him? The building is on fire? Can I move and try to duck into the building? I see a hole that's not on fire. Yeah. I'll try to hide in the building because wyverns, he's so dumb. How about that? That is a 14. Oh, right, that's poison. So she's immune. He's going to use a legendary. I can see it on his damn face. You can't? On your first attack! Can't you just attack twice with the dragon sword? Why not? Oh. Pike cheat sheet. Pike. Heroes' Feast? Pike is going to cast Heal on herself at seventh level. So she's going to heal herself for 80 points. So she's got 84 points now. She was super low. Okay, but then she can't heal people. And then is anybody injured around her? Gilmore's still pretty low, right? Okay, then she's going to run, she's going to cast Healing Word on Gilmore. At second level that she can do it at? So that's, oh, right, because now shit's gone. Ten. And she's going to use her movement to run back into the building with Scanlan. I know, right, fucking A, Scanlan! Wait, you're close to Pike. She uses War God's Blessing to increase your attack by-- can she do that? Is it technically an attack that she could add? Was it really low? So yeah? So, do I roll the ten, or is it just a plus ten bonus? Oh my god. 4d8? 8d8?!LAURA,  That's great!, TRAVIS, TRAVIS Thanks for getting my attention for that. (laughter) That was the softest little roll. Natural 20? Don't say that out loud. Why would you bring more things onto the battlefield?! Do I have a view of it? That's good, that's good. That's not a damn it, that's a good. Yeah, we're all dead on the ground, and Scanlan's like, yay! Look how little she is. Is that one, like, still up or something? Is it like a concentration that just lasts? Oh, Contagion? Yeah, he's definitely done it twice. Just do what you're going to do. You could attack again? Can't you hold your other attack until he moves? He's like, welp, I'm over this. Oh god. Gilmore is up his butt. No! Oh no, that's Pike and Scanlan isn't it? What? Why would you do that to Pike?! One of our Jaeger controllers did worse than our other-- Pike is-- Wait, minus 50. She's at 50 minus--she's at 34 points right now. Can you attack him now? Did I see where that dragon-slaying arrow sailed off to? 12 points of damage. 21. 56. I can't see anything about where I am. Yeah, I can't see that on the screen, so I don't know. Can I use disengage to get away from the wyvern? I'm going to do that and I'll run out somewhere. Where's the laser pointer? I just have no clue where I am. No way! Oh, I thought you said the face. If I'm hasted, does that affect my broom? So I just run out. Okay. Then I'm going to run through the building and under Raishan and shoot up at Thordak from through the building. Okay. Oh no, that one doesn't hit. Okay, second one. Okay, that hits. That's 29. Can I do that with a poison arrow? I should have said that before. Never mind. 18, that's with four lightning. I do get sneak attack right now. 15 more. Yeah. Should I do the second dragon attack? I'm so scared to use the dragon arrow. I'm going to use my dragon arrow. My last one. Oh, good! That was so close but it definitely hit. Oh God. Okay. 17 with one lightning. So three more. And how many do I add for the dragon arrow? I think it's 10d6. I think. Or 6d10. It's one of those two. 10d20. 12d12. He gets to save? Oh! Whoa. That's okay, I'll just roll this, 'cause this is easier. Oh, that was just 6d10. 32 halved. What?! Look at the puny little fuck. Can I duck around the side so I'm in the building? So I'm not in the opening. Yeah. 17. So she's got ten points left. And Pike does! And Pike rolled a 32. Her Mace of Disruption. And then she gets Divine Strike, right? On her attack. Pike rolled-- fuck. 18. 19! It was 19. It's 45 for the first attack, 21 for the second. This is going to be bad if we have to take Raishan out. She's still alive. She gets up. (singing) She's going to Guiding Bolt up the butt! At what level do we have left? She's going to cast it at a five. 4d6. Plus 4d6. So 8d6. She has to roll the attack first, or just straight-up? 24. All right. So 8d6. Five. Seven. Eight. Ten. 16. 18. Another two. 26. Oh good. And then she's going to Healing Word again? Yeah, she's pretty fucked, so she'll Healing Word at second level, that's her last 2nd-level... And that's just to one person? Yeah, so she'll... so she's going to do that to Jarett. It's Pike. I'm being honest, she would heal Jarett. So that's eight. "Jarett, you need to get up and fight." Yeah. "Scanlan, I can do that myself." So that's 8d4? That is 8d4. Do you do that or do I? Okay, that's good. We're going to have to fight Raishan in a second. She's at 36. Hey, he's got a hole in the middle of his chest. Yes! She casts her last War God's Blessing. Add a ten to that. Every time! Did you add four to your 26 when you healed her? Or did you just roll-- 30 for me. Eight for Pike. She's going to hit us. No, she decides where it hits. No, 'cause Thordak's already gone. Who is that guy? Dragon just landed on him, basically. Maybe you can jump and then cast it. Climb it, climb it, Keyleth! Just do it! It didn't drop fear when he died? Okay, just checking. (laughter) I didn't know if it was a reset when you wake up. You've got big-level spells, don't you, still? (gasps) He got another natural 20! That's a really pretty die that he's got, too. Sparkly. No! Why is this good? Vax, be careful! Okay. I run after him and dive after him, because I saw that. And at the edge of my movement, I want to hop out on my broom and get ready to fly down the hole after. Can I cast-- 'cause I didn't do an attack, right? Times two? It's all times two, 'cause that's all-- well, 15 times two is 30. In the dark. Alone. I do know. Can I fly forward before we take the break? I just want to fly forward and hug my brother as he's just covered in dragon guts. Nobody's there. Vestige! Pike-- oh, Pike's turn! Jesus. I'm sorry! Okay. She stands up. Okay. Okay, Pike stands up. She's going to run forward and say, "You can't have all the fun, "Grog!" And she's going to Guiding Bolt, level four, at the fire giant. Okay, okay. Okay, that's 18. Okay. Oh, wait. 17. She says, "So, sorry! I guess you do have all the fun. How are you on hit points, Grog? You okay?" Okay, then she's going to Healing Word herself at first level. Okay, that's six points. 15. 15. When you were healing Pike with the superior, did you add-- Oh, okay. So she's at 40 healed points now, not 42. You know what, if Raishan gets hit, she gets hit. I want her to get hit. Hugs! I'm heading ass-wherever! Stomp, stomp, stomp! Nice. This is his level, this is what Jarett needs at a time. He is bad-ass. Okay. What are you doing? I'm going to keep my hand ready to attack and hold my action until anything gets aggressive with Raishan. Thordak is dead. Oh, what do I see around me? Okay, I'm going to use my movement to back away from Raishan towards the chamber. But I'm going to hold my attack until I think it's aggressive. Okay. Oh, no, what is this? Yeah, but you can't throw your sword A 23. You can't do movement, because you were holding your action. Like a chameleon. She did attack our home. Should I have taken my shots when things got aggressive? I mean, did that look aggressive? It might not have been the same fucking spell. It could have been something like it. Yeah, adjacent. Said, "Come and claim me," and flew toward me? Yeah, I'm going to attack. Oh no. This isn't about vengeance, though, you guys. I don't know. (sad noise) That one doesn't hit. Probably. 18. That one probably hits. 27? And a natural fucking one. Fenthras can sense my trepidation. Just 15 damage. (laughs) Jarett is just like-- This is at advantage because it's a dragon-related thing? I don't know, what am I rolling for? Okay, 27. Five bebes?! Can I look back at Thordak? What does it look like-- I know Raishan, like, (gasps) made him do that. Does it look like there's anything around him, or is he just dead-dead still? 29. I have to find out if I'm for sure dead. I'm across the fucking room. She's not done. I do, I have to film all day. She might not have even needed to ask questions. Maybe it was just taking his soul into herself. Check out Backblaze.
