But we'll have one-shots and stuff in between. It was so much fun! Thanks bro! It's real fun to be stupid. I wish I still had the video of you that you sent me after you first started, yeah. When he first started playing Gollum, he sent me this video of him running around his living room, jumping up on his couch, then running over and jumping up your entertainment system or something. It was so amazing. Oh, well, technically, I have to shove this one to Liam and Taliesin, as well. Okay, I should qualify this, because it's not in the store yet, you guys, so don't go to the store and freak out. It just came into the office. We'll say when they're going to go in the store. Tune in to Talks Machina on Tuesday. We'll give you more details about how you can purchase them. And you can always check out geekandsundry.com/artbook for more updates. They're coming soon. They should be in the warehouse very soon, so that's happy for the holidays. I'm excited! This is her day job! Look at how big the face is! Oh yeah, our drunken ren fair purchases. I was like, "that's a cool mask! Where'd you get it?" And you said, "you got that for me." I'm glad your mind went there, too. Can I get made over? When are you doing it? Shit, I'm not going to be here! Fuck, I really want to be made over! Did you say Fernando? No! I take off on my broom, and I go down to try to get her. Technically, he was on the broom with me, so I could've dropped him off with one of you before I flew down to Velora. Okay, it's 30. Zahra and Kash? You can use the carpet because Percy's on the broom with me. They're not you on the cliff. Oh my god, if we thought we made it out of this-- Well, Pike's with you. Yeah, Pike's still with you up there. In a moment. Grab the rod. Not bad. And Grog is dead. And we're all on the ground now? Kash, tell me you have Revivify. Tell me you can bring her back. Our sister. No. It's terrible. Please help her. No! I don't want to fucking talk to her, I want to have her back! (laughter) Is she going to come back as a zombie? She'll be a normal-- Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I sit down and hold her hand. Jesus, really? Oh, god. I take one of my arrows that has the owlbear feather on it, and I put it down next to her because I know she loved owlbears. I hug her. Oh, and I pop Trinket out of his necklace, and I cast Cure Wounds on him so he can lick her face. I've still got a 3rd-level Cure Wounds on him. Hi, little monkey. You went on an adventure, that's all. Of course. Oh, he saved your life just now, dear. No, but seriously, could she be evil? Seriously. Yeah. She's fine. (laughter) He's really stupid. Okay, yeah. Just rest. I'm going to sit her on top of Trinket so she can take a little nappy-nap. We can't thank you enough. Again. I'm so glad you're all right. Yeah, you'll be a little busy with the child and all. Really? I give her a big hug. I love you so much. Congratulations. At night. In the night. Yeah, obviously. Give it some time. I look at Percy. This would be a wonderful place for a summer home. (chuckles) WILL and Thank you, guys. Same. All right. Bye loves. Hey, you've got your hands full, all right? He fucking dead. He's been sealed away. I have a purple flare too. We should all set them off. I send up my purple flare, too. That's a lot of writing. He's been practicing that shit in his bedroom. I mean, yeah. That's good. He helped us. And then he fucked us. Yeah. Yeah, he probably does. You seem to like him a lot. Are you sure you want to kill him and not just try to get-- Yeah, I don't think he's going to understand. The bag of colding. The hand does really bad things. You know what you should do is bring that to Bahamut. Don't piss on it, Grog. But then maybe if they try to use the hand to find it, it might lead them to you instead because you've already pissed on it. Potentially. You don't want people chopping off your junk thinking your junk is Vecna's hand, do you? Put it in the bag of colding. All right. Tiamat's the bad guy. Kima. Yes. What's going on there, Grog? Don't piss on the hand. Number one it's already in the bag of colding and I don't want everything else pissed on. What should we do, you guys? We already all got tattoos, didn't we? No, I thought we got them in character. Oh, we got the Slayer's Take. Hey, while he's out, should we get this sword off him? Because it seems like he's a little weird from it. Nobody else feels that way? Nothing. Yeah, no, it's getting better. Should we get off of the titan, maybe? We'll have to get through the titan, or we can fly down. Outside of that, I don't know. (gasps) Sylas. Right, but he's repairing somewhere. Do you have Daylight, still? Something with sun? I guess sunlight would take him out, because it's during the day. You can't do it? Can I try to cast Locate Object on the pants he was wearing? They're an object. I've seen them! Yes. Nothing? He's definitely recovering naked. Fuck! Nothing. No pants. We're going to have to worry about him at some point. Yeah, but how are we going to take him out if you use all your spells to find him? He's running away. I don't think so. TRAVIS and I mean, if we can bring people back, they might be able to. So do we go see the leaders here? That was a shitty spell he cast. I'm going to hold on to Velora. And Trinket, I swear it's going to be the last time, buddy. I'm not going to keep making you go in this necklace much more. Ooh, I love him so much. She's all right. How's Kima? He'd been taken. LIAM and Into the wood. Oh, proof. And that titan has stopped moving. You remembered the word. Yeah, glitter bomb. Oh, glitter-bomb Vecna! I like the idea that he got glitter-bombed. This is weird. They haven't done our fees, right? You've been giving us really good inspirational speeches. Get up and say something. Say something really awesome. We've got a really long time to be alive. You've got an infinite time. What's a few more years? No. I feel like she's taking part of me away. I don't know how to live. I know. Please. I love you. I don't accept this. I'm going to find you. I hug Trinket. Sorry, Scanlan. Percy, please let him out, I can't take it right now. How could you do that? Oh shit. Keyleth, dear. I know it was never made official, but I'm assuming you two would've spent your life together. As much of it as he had, anyway. I would've never known. I still count you as my sister. Yes. She's terrible. You know we have a temple to her in Whitestone. I mean, here's the thing though. I feel like I want to destroy it because I hate her so much, but at the same time, I feel like we should leave it because maybe we can talk to him through it. We'll try it. She's got the gauntlets on. Roll a one! Roll a one! Oh shit! Grog, you wouldn't have to do anything on your own. Yeah. We're in this together. Can I walk over to Percy? Are you still over by yourself? No. I'm going to sit down next to you. Now I'm going to sit down next to you. How are you? I do. You did. Now it does. What were you going to do? Are you going to fight the Raven Queen for me? I think we're all broken, Percy. You don't have to hurt anyone anymore. I love you. It's horrible! Darling. You're a good person and you're not broken anymore. All right? We'll filling each other's gaps. We'll be the glue. And don't do anything crazy anymore. No deals with Raven Queens, all right? Let's not fight any more gods. I want to see if I can talk to him through it. Is that stupid? We did a thing today. A pretty big thing. So much. Oh shit, on everybody?! That was the best wookiee noise you've ever made, babe! You said Allura took Velora? Oh, okay. I thought you said Allura took her away. Okay. Did I just leave her? I feel weird just leaving her. I'll run back and talk to her. I'm going to make sure her wounds were tended because she was pretty busted up. Is there anyone who can send me to Syngorn? Do you think we should-- Maybe a message of Sending. Can anyone do that? Pike? Do you have the message of Sending? To my father. Okay. Allura, you've done it before. Could you send something to my father? No. Velora, would you want to go home right now? I miss you too. Okay. I think so too. Allura, will you say that Velora is safe, and that I'll be paying a visit very soon to return her? Thank you. Apple juice for you, little one! I'm bringing my sister to a bar. Of course, dear. That's what you wrote down, too. Can we have another cup? Did you see Kaylie and Gilmore? Apple juice. To Vax'ildan. He was the best of us. Syngorn and Whitestone, I would assume. In Emon? Someone should stay there. Or you could just hang in Whitestone. The Grand Poobah has a lot of responsibilities, too. Potentially. Why? You've got enough juice to get us to Whitestone right now? Should we drunkenly walk to the tree? Don't you want to see your daughter? No. Nothing powerful comes without a price. We saw that. We just saw that with the Raven Queen. Power comes at a price. You think that wonderful things are going to be pulled out of your hands here, and there's going to be no consequences? Don't do it! You've got to get your construction on? (quietly) Go see your daughter. I'm going to tuck Velora into bed. I tiptoe out of the room, and I find Percy. Percival? Could I talk to you for a moment? I completely understand if you want to stay with Cassandra for the night. Would you mind not being very comfortable, though? I was thinking of camping in the woods. Trinket? Of course. I send Trinket to Keyleth's room. She might cry a lot on you. All right, dear? It's going to be a lot harder to stay warm out in the woods now. I wanted to remember how I used to camp with Vax when we were kids. I guess we go out and set up a little fire. Outside of the castle. Oh my god. It is really happening. I can't fucking believe-- That's the worst one you could get! That is so bad! Well, the campaign goes on for another-- I can't believe you just fucking did that. Ashley? Oh my god! Is Ashley texting? I can't fucking believe that shit. You fucking idiot. I cannot believe you did that. Yeah. You're lucky we didn't shave your beard. Yeah. You fucked up a lot. Hey! Hi! Oh my god, that was craziness. Penniless? Two weeks ago. (laughter) He is. Thank you, Pike. It's absolutely perfect. Do you want it out in the woods? I like it. Yeah, it's stealthy! Perfect timing, Ash. You were that young? You motherfucker! Oh my god, I can't believe you were that young. I thought you were 300 years old. Jesus. Oh! That's so great! You wrote a letter? You're Iounish? (laughs) Are you going to be in your shop a lot? Holy shit. That's good. I love that idea. No, although we will have to stay here for nine months every once in a while, because I think we should rebuild the families that we've lost. Five names. Five. I definitely want to build a statue to Trinket, the wonder bear. No, Trinket's around. So centuries of people in Whitestone will remember their mascot, Trinket. As the years pass, we should start a festival and bears will be everywhere. Perfect. I was hoping to never stop attempting to contact Vax through the temple of the Raven Queen. I cast Speak with Animals on them and I constantly try to communicate with him. Would you be all right if we increased the Pelor temple here? Thank you, darling. Pretty much, yeah. Definitely. At least she had some good promise a long time ago. We'll make you strong, darling. Yeah, there's a beautiful place called Dalen's Closet. I think you would love it. I have "Make Whitestone the tits," written in my notes of things that I want to do. Yeah, Penny Bear. I like it. Yeah. Wow. Thank you. Oh fuck. Shit. Yay! Yeah, we'll be back. That was a really pretty sendoff, Matt. Thank you. Love you, Matthew.
