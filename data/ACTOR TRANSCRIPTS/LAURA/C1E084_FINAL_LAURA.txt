You did it. Oh, wow. Mercer! Oh no! Ice-cold. Good job, Ashley. Oh gosh, yeah! Okay, you guys. I know we've been teasing it for a while, but guess what we have back in stock? Why, they are! Don't get too excited right now, 'cause they're not in the store at this very moment, okay? We're putting them up for sale tomorrow at noon our time, Pacific Standard Time, so that, you know, all you lovely folks that don't get to watch at 7PM on Thursdays can maybe snag 'em tomorrow afternoon, too. So, 12PM. Go to the store tomorrow. That's Friday, and you will get one of these cool things. That's right. We've licked very bag. I literally just licked it. Nice, nice. Armpits. Lots of armpits. Noon. There's a diamond. You know, The fates just wanted Scanlan to come back. I know. Oh, good. Oh, God. So building, huh? (laughs) I thought you were grabbing a room, Eskil. Aren't you tired? Just so tired. (laughter) We probably need our sleep right so that we can recharge those spells of yours as soon as possible. (dryly) Oh, are you sure, darling? You're so attractive to me. Well, you better get to bed before I jump on you. (all laugh) I sit down next to Doctor Dranzel. I look to see where his other hand is. (laughs) Just seeing what it was, dear. Didn't want to sit on it. As is mine. Did you hear what I said to Kaylie? How do you feel about that? That can't be true. That cold... I hold onto my purse the entire time talking to him. Motherfuck. 22. Trying to cop a feel, darling? Yeah, but Scanlan's special. He will be. To Scanlan You motherfucker. You're lucky that our keep was under attack and everything else got ransacked. Otherwise, I'd come after you. Well, give some of your luck to Scanlan. I'm going to bed. Yeah. Don't come to my room. I'm serious, don't. But seriously, don't. (sarcastically) Isn't he dreamy? And I head upstairs. I stay up for a really long time waiting to hear any kind of word from Allura, from anybody... Something. Nope, they didn't. So I'll eventually go to sleep, wondering if Scanlan's alive. That was awesome! And liquid. Grog never washes. (laughs) Oh my god. Ayyy! Terrible. (gasps) It could be like a week before he wakes up all moldy and nasty. (laughs) Did I ever get a message? (excited noise) I wake Trinket up. He's alive! He's alive! And I go running out of the room. He's alive! to the entire bar down below. It worked! It worked! Who's awake!? Anyone? Is anyone awake? You! I'm buying you a drink! (all laugh) Yeah. What's the best thing you've got? That's, you know, within reason? (all laugh) I'm in! Let's do it! and then pour a bowl of ale for my bear here. Cause he was in my necklace earlier when I came in. Yeah. Drink up, buddy. That's some expensive shit. Cheers! I know, right!? Yeah, god, five years! (old-timey voices) Nineteen aught five! (laughs) (gasp) Where is he? Where is he? Oh. Oh, oh! It takes a lot out of you. How's everyone? Are you good? How'd it go? (relieved sigh) I was so worried. I'm so glad to be here. The town. You know, I didn't see much of it. Outside of a bar. Yeah, me and Eskil had some times though, I can tell you. That guy is a partier. Oh yeah. He put some moves on me, Percy. You should be aware. Thanks again darling! It was wonderful. So what are we doing today? Swamp ass? Oh! (unwrapping a candy loudly) (with her mouth full of candy) Where's Vax?! Where is he? He stayed in the temple?! Well, I'm, gonna go find him! I give Percy a kiss on the head as I walk by. It's good to see you again. Glad you're alive. Where's my brother? (all laugh) What are you doing!? Trinket, stay outside, it's holy in here. Oh. Well. I walk in blindly, one hand in front of me. Are you really naked or are you just saying that? Where are you? No! (all laugh) I heard he's alive! That's pretty great, right? I turn my back to him so I can open my damn eyes. What are you doing sleeping in here?! Ahh, creepy! Get off! Fucking gross! Nothing! Nothing! (still laughing) Yeah... Oh, really? By whom? So she did contribute. Thank God that trip wasn't for nothing. What's done? What? I mean... Can I turn around? Okay. I mean, I think so? Right? I don't know what she was up to, but-- What were you doing here! Why are you sleeping in this cold, creepy temple when everyone else is celebrating? Oh, well, yes, of course. Not to the detriment of your happiness. Ish? Now that dragons are defeated and all of Tal'Dorei can live in peace and harmony and Vox Machina, the heroes that everyone was searching for... Staying where? Here? Here in this temple? Here in Whitestone? I know what you're talking about. I mean, I do have a keep here. Right, a castle? A home. I also have money. I can build. What're you gonna do? Would you stay? You have a temple! You know, I can get some lush pillows put in here as well. This is on my property after all! (laughs) Right! Well, of course! I mean, one of-- I mean, it's-- Hasn't been very long, dear, who knows what's gonna happen? Sure? Would you like me to travel with you and Keyleth? (distressed) Why are we talking about this!? Don't talk about this now! This is a time of happiness, don't talk about sad things! Please... Please? Good! Good. Come. All right! Well! Put your armor on-- Well, what if I help you! Done it before. Ten minutes, then, right? Go get some breakfast, after all. I mean we're all healed, everything's great? What are we gonna do, we're bringing Scanlan with us? Scanlan's gonna stay here? Alone? Oh that's true. I mean I wasn't there, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. (all laugh) What did you do? All right. How are you doing, Kaylie? You look great. Of all this and that. All right. That man's a hero. A giant one. Killing a dragon. Shh, Grog. Yeah. Well it did until it was destroyed by the dragon. You're a good man, Kerr. Awww. Ahhhh. Patrick! (applause) Yeah. In your bedroom. That sounded like Dolores Umbridge. Eddie! (laughs) There it is. What stuff, though? This kind of stuff? You just wait. (sighs) We have a lot of stuff we need to do. That's in Vasselheim. We were just there. Yeah, not so much. Because we told them we would give them a hand. You know, the thieves' guild thing. The group of assassins. Shouldn't we help with making sure the Council is in place? Is everything solid here? Just to make sure. How is Jarett? Was he fine when we got back to Whitestone? Okay. He's like, "Fuck you!" 19. N-n-n-n-nineteen. Okay. No. They kind of have their shit that they're doing. We're solid. Well, Allura's here. Well, the problem is, Uriel was killed when the dragons attacked. Nothing else was ever set in place after that. Thordak. No Feywild? Not for a bit. Allura, before we leave. Will you take a look? I hand her the box of ashes that Senokir gave us. Do you sense any kind of aura coming off of this, or do you think it is what he said just a box of his wife's ashes? Okay. Thank you. Oh! Kima? Hey, those boots? It's unfortunate that they look a little iffy with your armor, though. Just kind of-- can we have them back, please? We might be sneaking around, you know, in life or death situations, and you're going to be here with the Council. We did give you that. Those are for you, man! No, cause you have the Sprinter's Boots on. You got the Sprinter's Boots on. She's giving you the Elven Boots. They're stealth boots! They make you silent! Kima, seriously though. You are great. Lies! Lies. We're not? (laughs) You got it. Shit! Yeah! Let's walk to our keep and bamf out there. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah! We had to make sure everything was alright here. You got a-- remember a servant of Sarenrae came down and helped us rebuild Eventually we do have to hire some people again. Minimalistic now. I wonder if we should offer this up to the city to the council to house some refugees that haven't found homes again, after they've been destroyed. Right. Should I run back and tell Allura that before we head out? I'll head off on the broom and try to find Allura. Should probably head out. Then I'm back, right? Sweet. Check one off the list. In Vasselheim? He didn't say not to. He said it was his wife's ashes after all. Do you not trust it? Did we look, though? Did we look-- And, I mean, I had Allura look at the box. She said it had a faint magical aura of protection. No. Playing with those dice, are you? So fiiine. If you want to do it, just do it. Yeah. Should we scoot this forward a little bit? What're you doing, Pike? Do you not trust it? Too simple for us? He's not? He's not allowed? I don't remember him saying that. Seems odd, right? I mean, it is his wife's ashes. Some people are truthful, but I mean Senokir did wanna make us his slaves-- Pike could be saving our lives right now. Ooh. I mean, it does have a magical aura of protection so it might be-- (laughs) I put my hands up and walk a little bit away. Can you both just ask, you know? We just fought Raishan, I don't blame this. You're not supposed to say all those things. Yeah. That's good, that's good, that's good. Yeah. We should stick to the outside of the city, right? Because of the magical laws there-- Solid. Melora! But didn't he say that she was from this area? Zaafin was from this area? Okay, I have a thought. What if we do bury this where he's asked, but we put it inside of something that deters magic? TRAVIS and I don't know. Like a fine container or something. It was just a thought. Isn't there things like that? Like a chest or something that dispels magic so that if he is trying to do something nefarious, then we keep him from doing that. Good call. I like it. Could you cast Speak with the Dead on ashes? Abundant Terrace. Be an idiot! Wow. Is that couple pretty close? Do you feel powerful when you go-- yeah? Did you just hijack her Twitter? Does it kind of remind us of Sondur's tree? Okay. Can I keep an eye out for any kind of tombstones or anything in the area that looks like anybody else might have done similar things? Oh, is it at advantage because we're in a forest? Perception, you said? That's a 20. Can I check 'em out and see if it looks like-- What? Well, I'm trying to take up less space 'cause we, you know? What was the first one? 15. Shut up. All right. I don't know. It looks like it could be a marker, a tombstone, memorial, something like that. We could. That's cocked, that's cocked. Okay. Let's do it. It's beautiful! Are they all holy or is this like-- Okay.  This is beautiful! No. MARISHA No problems with that? Solid. Anything with orange flowers around? I feel like Senokir would like orange flowers. Oh, yeah. Did you happen to know a woman named Zaa... Zaafin-- (laughter) She was a big fan of this place. Probably. Probably. We've never buried ashes before. Great, that's wonderful! (clicks her tongue) None taken. Bad, bad, very bad. That's nice. Does the Birth Heart have healing properties? Right? Does it? Yeah. We're so weird. That got serious! Some deities might like each other more than other deities though. --like besties. Whoa, let's stop. Let's stop. Let's just-- -- bury these ashes. Is it all right if we dig a hole? All right. Sure! As I'm doing it, I'm like, Melora, you were clutch in the fight against Raishan and we appreciate it greatly. Thank you for everything you've done for us. Your trees are beautiful. Are you talking to the dirt? (laughs) I'm gonna cover it. It's getting covered. Could we leave a marker of some sort? So we know exactly where we left her. I saw earlier circles of stones. Is that traditional? Can you think of anything Senokir would've appreciated? Maybe a ring? He's a jeweler. It was his wife. That's perfect. Oh, thank you. Can we go in? Can we go up and look, or? Is it like-- It's just beautiful, I don't think I've ever seen-- We should've led with that. (through her bottle) That's why you keep things hidden. She's aided us greatly. Protecting the world-- Champion of Melora! I see it now. It was beautiful, though, while it lasted. I think it'll grow back, Grog. Yeah. Do we need to stock up on supplies? Yeah. Do you need to check in on the temple? (gasps) Just a fist fight. Yeah, armor? They got gnome fights? What're you doing with a rock? Doesn't seem like something you normally look for. It's more Grog's speed there. We can go there. The Braving Grounds. By the Obleiz. Obliette. It does! Oh, that's what it was. Oh, man! Are you looking at your schedule? Wow. Should we wait out here for you? All right. Oh, shit. Fight! (sings the Dragon Ball Z theme song) How long have you waited-- how long have you-- Oh, shit! Oh, man. Yeah, but in the best way. It's serious. Vax. But in a good way. He's, like, super, super smart. (laughs) Oh, my. Yay, Scanlan! Happy birthday! And don't forget, tomorrow at noon, these dice go on sale! Yay, Crit Role dice! No there's more than there were last time. Brain Fester. Brain Fester! Brain Fester!
