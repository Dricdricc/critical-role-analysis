You don't need a badge. Yay. I'm on a boat. I'm on a boat. No, don't say it, don't say it yet. Pretty much. Travis is directly behind you. Yeah, you might be even in his face at this point. Can you still see Travis? MARISHA AND Oh. That's true. Boomf! I was being you, Tiberius. Light! (gasps) Oh, no way. No, yeah, everyone looks to the same-- I can't tell what happening. Oh, Sam's here. Oh, that's right, our little halfling that we-- Oh. Okay. She's locked up. Oh, that's good to know. I was going to pay you to put the kibosh on her. It's a percentage die. Ew. It's translucent, like-- It's really creepy, Grog. Ooh. Maybe you can cast Grasping Vine on his chin and grow it out. I encourage violence. So we're healed. We're healed, right? Trinket's feeling good. (sings) With her big fancy die! Good call, Tiberius. Good call. I agree, it is rather cold. Ooh! His tiny mind is exactly proportionate for the rest of his body, Tiberius. That's true. Brag about it, Tiberius. Just keep bragging about it. Oh. Everything makes sense now, Tiberius. Hey. That's wonderful. Oh, it's better than the Pearl of Power! That's a good trade. Ooh. It's snow, Keyleth. What's that? What are Fire Ashari? Right. So they-- oh. We've got your back, Keyleth. Totally. You know, if you want to, Keyleth, when we go, we'll all follow your orders and make it seem like you're an extraordinary leader of us. Ooh! So the tornado thing. You could be like a fire tornado? We've noticed. You're great, though. Are you guys friendly with each other? So, like, you could die? (gasps) What? Keyleth. Yeah. It's not like your family, Grog. They're actually nice. That sounds wrong in so many ways. That's good. All right. We will go. Yeah. (whispers) Wow. Stop by. Give a little hello. My kind of place. Look, Trinket! Home. We'll follow your lead. Good talk! Does it look like it's suffered a lot of sieges? I mean, is there battle damage to the-- Is it cold in the city? I have a lot of winter cloaks already in my-- Well, those are fancy clothes. But I've got winter coats that I bought for the group a long time ago. All right. Remember? He wants a fancy robe, not a fur. Oh. (laughter) It's green? It's a green-- wait, is it like a diamond shape? It's like a Sim! As long as it's green, you're happy, Scanlan! Where do we take the Horn? Our escorts? Kima, when was the last time you were with your Order? Oh. Do you get along well with them? Oh, we're no proper company. It's all right. Hmm. Well, nobody knows what it is. So we'll just be aware there's a huge envoy. What kind of man is he? No no no, right? The best one? I've always noticed a fine metallic sheen coming from your red scales. You look very nice, Tiberius. Definitely, we should all kind of surround the box, sure. Oh. I can stick to the rooftops, I guess, try to follow along. I'll snick to the rooftops and try to follow along, sniper eye. Oh. Not disturbing. Oh, well I rolled a one. So that's lovely. Do I have advantage in-- no. But with the forests I'd be amazing. Yeah. I wink at them as I'm climbing up. Yeah. Oh! There were some sapphires in there, too, some blue sapphires, I remember. I very, very poorly fall off of the roof and clamber down. Keyleth-- No, you-- What? You're gonna leave the city, brother? Come on in the temple. Yeah, you would. Hydra! You think it's a hydra? Shut up! (gasps) You should have transformed into a fly. Oh no! (gasps) (gasps) This is the second time you've been arrested! Keyleth! Again, Keyleth? Oh. Yeah, you listen to Lady Kima. She does, Grog. Is everything okay, Pike? Whoa. All right. Is that the bad one? I mean, I know that because I know a lot about dragons. Is Tiamat still alive? Is he still around? Oh. I mean. (nervous laugh) Tiamat's still around, huh? Oh. Yeah we do. Oh, right. Right here? (whistles) Are you guys-- oh, sorry. I was just wondering. You've had one of these before, yes? Great. (shouts) Good job, Yonn! 300 years? Oh. It was just a thing? That big scary creature living out in the woods. Sorry, brother. Huh. And then it was lost. Lost, as in-- While everybody's been talking, can I have used my Primeval Awareness to see within six miles if there's any dragons around us? Oh, okay. All right. That's all I wanted to know. No, we need to go-- we also need to-- are we going to do that now? Go clear out the basement? Let's clear out the basement. Yeah? I mean, you want us to do it now, yeah? No, neither would I. I mean, obviously we want the Horn taken care of, but-- -- you know, we're taking care of a problem for you, too. The holiest place? I was just wondering. I'm not asking. Per party member, yes? We don't want money, of course not. I mean, I-- Yes, spreading the word of Bahamut where we go. It's not a deception, we really will-- Oh. That's really good because I rolled a 19. Wait! Yeah, I did. Are you going to come with us, Kima? Oh, good. At ease, soldiers. Are we going to find any of these defenses right away, or what? Check for some traps, brother. Traps in the stairway. Can I check for traps or see if there's anything-- Yeah. Oh, he already rolled. Look at him. Perception? 25. Hm. All right. Do I notice any-- does it seem-- Well, without touching it. Any kind of poisonous in nature, anything like that? I don't get one anymore? You're taking it off of me right now? All right. Ugh. Should we try breathing it and see what happens? I just reach my arm into the mist and just see-- Oh, maybe we should just not touch the mist and go straight through the room. So you can blow it and we just walk through? Should we go? Let's go before it gets back. Go, go, go. I perception-checked the room. It didn't seem like there was anything. Vax! Super duper short. Well, all Vax has to do is roll, because he's already on the freaking ground. We're still in the room. Oh, they're coming with us, they're like coming with us through the whole thing? Keyleth, blow the smoke again. Blow the mist away. If you can. And now we run. (shouts) Your breath smells pretty good, though, Keyleth. Do you want to shoot an arrow in? Yeah, let's do it. 16. He's better. Great. Those are probably traps. Pressure plates, maybe? What? Shouldn't we throw something onto one of the pressure plates first and see what it does? Are you kidding me?! Vax! Jeez. Well, let's try this first because you might just break it down completely. You are much more powerful than I am, Percy. All right, can I try to shoot an arrow into the little hole? Oh, jeez Louise. Okay, what does that mean? This is, what, an attack? Thanks, Grog. You know what, I'm going to tie this to the arrow. It's going to give it really good luck. I'm not actually going to tie it to the arrow. I'm just going to tuck it-- Yeah. So you can deflect it if I-- All right, thanks, Tiberius. Oh, I'm so nervous. I'm going to roll the fancy one we got last week. All right. (laughs) Oh, no. Okay. I add my attack bonus? Plus an inspiration dice? Oh, that's awesome! Okay. 35. (yelling) Oh, let me just see if I got it first! Hey. You totally could have done that. Nice. Yeah, all right. Good job getting slammed into the roof like that. Yeah. Okay. Woo. Yes. Oh, let-- no! We haven't even talked about it at all! Donate, donate. I don't even know what that means. So donations tonight are going to GameChanger, yeah? Awesome. I think donations tonight will definitely go to GameChanger, yeah. Yeah, the portion of the donations that would normally go to 826LA tonight are going to go to GameChanger. Oh, awesome. Anything over a dollar. It would be good if you donated more than one dollar, if you want. Oh, god, okay. Ugh. Nice. What's plastic? I stealth immediately. Oh, yeah, that would be good! So, with the Pass Without a Trace? 31. Pass Without a Trace. Can I cast, while they're coming-- where did I write it down? Never mind, I can't find my spell. I cast Entangle on the ground. Yeah. (quickly) Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm reading it now. Oh, that's not what it was. That's the wrong spell. Sorry, sorry, it's Spike Growth, is the spell. I cast Spike Growth. Yes, which is-- the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. It's difficult terrain for the duration, but anybody that can see me casting it doesn't take damage to it, it's only the people that don't see me casting it. Yeah. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a wisdom check. Oh. Well, that's not quite the same thing, then, what I saw. (yells) Forget it, my spell is stupid! I know! They can see the ground. Then no, don't cast it. Not you guys, but they-- That's my punishment. I don't think that should count. Wheatoning? Yeah. 23. He's gone. Me? Oh! I'm going to cast Conjure Barrage at all of the spiders coming at us. I'm going to Hunter's Mark whatever one looks the biggest. Oh, where am I? Oh. I'm going to move to where I'm in the middle of them. I'm still kind of stuck. Yeah, and then I'll Conjure Barrage from there. I cast Hunter's Mark on the biggest one I see. Okay. It does 3d8 on all creatures. They get-- yes, they do. They get half-damage if they save. (in a funny gruff voice) My DC is 14. Okay. Do I need to roll for attack? Oh, sweet! Okay, cool. Okay. 3d8. 15, and then 20 for the big one with the Hunter's Mark. Can I have Trinket attack? Oh, that's a lot of them. Okay, so I get a second attack? Cool, I'm going to step back against the wall. Nah, he can't really get anywhere, it's fine. It's good times, guys. (gasps) What? I think you should stick with it, it's awesome. Fireball. Nice! Now you're in front of the spiders. You're killing them! Good, because I rolled an eight. Ugh. Oh. There's what, there's three spiders left? Oh. He is so dead. Oh, bamf-ing spiders. Me? It hits me. 17? Oh, wait. 19. (grunts in pain) Oh, it's straight-up damage. I should cast that on us. Yeah. Eat it. Ooh, I bet we can get some of that poison. Dip the arrows in it. Ooh. Oh, we can just use them? Okay. Oh, thank you, Keyleth. Tiberius, would you happen to have a little glass vial or something I could put this in? Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh, wait, I thought you weren't poisoned-- oh, you need healing because you are-- Okay. Yeah, but we took a short break and we're not doing that now. No. Can I ask a question while she's healing Percy? The grappling arrow I used on the little halfling, I can get that back, right? Just making sure. No? Sam already said it. Scanlan, no. (groans) Oh, wow. Are there sapphires all over the walls in here, then? (gasps) Oh no, that was my big fancy one. Really, really high. Eight. Can I try to stealth and move alongside just kind of keep to the edge? Okay, I rolled 18 on the stealth. And Trinket's going to stay next to Keyleth. Can we see a spider in here, like a big spider? Okay, can I-- it's dark? I'm going to use my Primeval Awareness and see if I can sense any spiders in the area. Good to know. (whispers) Lots of spiders. Lots. I'm going to cast Protection From Poison on myself. Before she touches anything, can I let her know that there's a whole lot of spiders on the other side of the room. Just so everybody's aware, those things we just fought? There's a ton more of them on the other side of this little chamber. No problem. Good thing you took that beard off because it had bells and shit in it. (whispers) Lots and lots of spiders. Is that going to make noise? Perhaps we should deal with the spiders before we make noise, or maybe just be prepared. In fact, you know what? I'm going to cast Spike Growth on the ground in between where they're going to have to walk through. Because they can't freaking see it right now, can they? Yeah, there, yeah. It affects-- damn it-- I didn't put it in my thingy because I'm dumb. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Spike Growth! It is a 20-foot radius. That's not that much. And it's hard spikes. Hard spikes and thorns. Oh, nice! Question. That chamber in the center of the room, does it go all the way to the ceiling, or is it-- So there's a huge-- so technically, the spiders could crawl up the ceiling and drop down on us? Yeah. Ooh, that's awesome. What? Had to be a spiderweb. Everybody? (whispers) Why? 14. That's 2d4 for every five feet crossed. 2d4 for every five feet. 22. (whispers) We should get out! Golems are meant to protect. Can I see? Oh, god. 25. Should I be rolling for Trinket? Okay, thank you. Okay. (gasps) Oh no. What what! 13. Oh, no! Oh, no, Grog, your beard has been singed. Yeah. You can grow it back, Grog. You've got some good security down there. A little warning next time would be great. Yeah. Oh! I'll hold onto that. Yeah. A little broken. We thought were maybe just disarming it but I think we probably broke it. Oh, Grog, actually-- I've got some remnants of a lovely beard. And I try to smush it onto his chin. It looks pretty good. Dang it. Highbearer Vord. Is the temple to Sarenrae on the way to the-- Oh. All of us can-- Magic. Thought it was banned. (whispers) Wow, Pike. You'll be back. Hey, it's still got Pike on it, you gotta get it now.
