Marisha, you yay'ed, good for you! It's that cabbage smell. So, you know, we talked about those posters last week. They're still in the store on pre-order. Some of them are getting shipped out right now, so you should be getting them soon. We're going to leave them on pre-order until Monday night, so if you're watching this on YouTube after it's been aired live, you've got until midnight to put in that order. Then they're going to be gone. Well, we might have a small overage that remains in the store. But the pre-orders will be done. You know what I mean. And then hey, check out that other stuff like shirts, hats, and dice. We should be getting some more Vox Machina d20s. I know a lot of people have been asking about them. They're going to be restocked, hopefully within the next week. More will be coming soon if those sell out. You know how it goes. Is it? The innocent patrons, you mean? No, let's go to the stockade. Yeah. I would have guessed that about you. I'll follow Fjord. She just walked out. Is he a dude or is he a creature? I don't have my dice jail out yet. It's okay, he'll chill there. Oh, this is so exciting. To not drag any attention towards her, you are completely shoving her into the limelight. Well, technically, he wasn't part of the performance, technically he was saving everyone. Technically. Well, technically we just all met, technically. We're a group you guys! (laughter) Great, I really like it here so that's good that we get to stay so long. Her accent is really strong! It's hard to not match her accent! (laughter) They're not with us. Do you think it was the little girl? What happened? Oh, I thought you didn't like jails. So should we go in and try to get her out? Okay. We'll follow her in. She was also helping to save a lot of people. Big misunderstanding. I know isn't it so weird? It smells like Caleb down here. (laughter) I know, why doesn't she get to talk to the Lawmaster? What do you mean? Oh no, are you guys making fun of her because of her spasm? She's a very calm person. I've never seen her angry, ever. It was an adopted sister. I was helping! She's staying at the same place that we are. Do you need me to heal that? MARISHA (through gritted teeth) No! For the cause! Do it for the cause! Yeah. The big zombie beast especially was using a lot of, like, sticks and stuff to attack people more than any kind of mouth. (laughter) Like, at all during the day, even? Just a question. If we wanted to shop or something. Not okay? Cool. It is really beautiful here, but I think I'd rather stay at the inn? You should have spasmed a couple times on the way here. Yeah. Opportunity missed. She's a dwarf! She's human! Oh. You didn't make that clear at all. Why would you save her? She turned those people into zombies. I mean, she could have. Oh, hi! You're here. So great! We're stuck in a city that has zombie issues, that's all. I'll go up and ask the tavern keeper. Yeah, Yorda. Oh my gosh, there was this big trouble at the carnival, did you go? Somebody turned into a zombie and then-- Yeah! And then we're all under investigation because we saved them! These guards are weird. Hey, did you see the wizard guy, the stinky guy and the little halfling? Oh, great! They're here! Yeah. That happens, yes. Can I have some milk? You think she heard that I wanted milk? Caleb, you want to see something cool? I show Caleb where I etched the dick in the table a couple nights ago. It's a dick. I have actually, I've been an artist since I was little. I've seen a lot of dicks. That is what most of them look like. What? Us two? Well, I don't know where he comes from. You think we all come from the same place? That was really inconsiderate. He's purple. Which is pretty rare. I'm from Nicodranas. Wow, that's a lot-- okay. My mother said don't give away other things for free. What do you do with the things once you steal them? Do you have a collection? What about shiny things, though? Because I think if you have sticky fingers for sticks and rocks, I don't think that will get you in trouble. Yeah, that makes sense. I'll keep an eye out for things that you would like. I can if you want me to. Or I can point it out. Yes! Steal something from me! Do you want me to close my eyes? Yeah. Just don't take the thing on my waist, because he'll be pissed. Yeah. Yeah. My symbol to the Traveler. I'm in a dress. I don't have a pocket on my buttcheek. But you can try. I would have pockets on the front of my dress, and maybe a little pouch on my hip. No, it's 13. You're doing great! It's okay, you can keep practicing. Should I say it? Oh my gosh. Wait a minute. Does this mean the silver I won from you was actually copper? Great! Thanks for the silver. Can you turn this into a gold piece? Well, tomorrow can you make it gold? Five gold for one silver a day? That doesn't add up. No. Three gold. That's pretty good. 40 days? Yeah, but I have lots of money. I don't need it. One gold. That's a really good deal. Did you hear how much he gave me a deal? Okay! Yes, I'll give him the gold. Hold on, let me make sure I have it. Where's my--? Oh, currency! Gold. Okay, one down. What's my magic word? How about skinky doodie? Okay, I will. Super a lot of focus. Skinky doodie. Thank you for this. It's close by here, right? I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows! Oh. Maybe he can teach you how to do that. That's where we met! If you need anymore displays, you just let me know. Oh yeah, I mean I can ask, but I think I'm tapped. Yeah. I can try! I'll put my hand out. I'll try to cast Cure Wounds. I got shit. I got nothing. It's not happening. Oh, no. I've got to sleep. Okay! That's 17. You know what? I think this might be worse than just like a bruised rib. Can I poke it? Does it seem infected? I'm not going to poke it with my finger, though, I'm going to poke at it with a fork. I'll use the blunt end, don't be such a baby! Oh, motherfucker, he's such a dick! That would be really cool. I'm just going make sure, I'm going to push on it a bit more. I think it's okay, you're fine. I think I need some sleep, you guys. But how can we because we can't leave this tavern? Fjord! You and I could leave in the morning the same way we got in. With magic. I would show you now, but I'm out of spells! No. I was making sure she wasn't a zombie. I thought she might be. She got clawed, right? All right. Hey bitches, I'm going to go to bed. As she starts to go to sleep, I want to draw in my sketchbook and tell the Traveler all about the cool things I saw for the day. I'm going to draw the red faced guard as I pretended I was a zombie, and I'm going to draw Molly's horns all full of jewels and stuff! I'm going to draw the stack of books. And I'm going to draw like a zombie, but like as an old man but as he's biting his dentures fall out and he's not no teeth! And all my spells back! Wait no, you're putting temporary hit points on! What are you doing? Hmm? I'm sorry. Can I go knock on Fjord's door? Ey oh ey, good morning! Hey, do you want to get out of here? Well, we sneak out and then we go find out why there are zombies. Yes. Well, if they can make themselves not look like themselves, then sure. Hey, Beau. Do you have anything you can do to make yourself not look like you? No, you look like you with a bandana around your head. Yeah. No, of course, we're coming back. No. Oh, but we could. Okay. We'll be back. Right. Can I try to pick a piece of bacon off your plate? Thanks. So we can find out why there are zombies. Well, because we were told we can't leave the inn. Huh. Well, that's convenient. Wow. I would never know it was you. It's true. I have a disguise kit, too. I could help you out. I'm really good at makeup. Yeah. I'm really shit at makeup. (laughter) He can leave, apparently. No, no, we're going to stay in town. We have to find out why there are zombies so we that don't get arrested for being zombies. I know it's hard to tell. You said he. I can tell. Yeah. I'm going to help Beau. You know what I'm going to do for you? I'm going to use my disguise kit I'm going to give you a beard. Yeah and I'm going to turn you into a dude, that's a good disguise, right? Was he helping me? Sure. Good. Okay, with the advantage. Dexterity. 15. It's good, it's good. And I'll cast Disguise Self on myself, as well, and turn myself into a human with blonde hair and she's going to be very clean-looking. Yes! With big lips, and a couple jewels on her fingers. Do you want help? Should we try to do this, then? Yeah, of course, not all at the same time, that's obvious. Can I walk up to Nott? (high-pitched) Do you like my outfit? And I'm just a young girl from town. Nott, it's me! It's Jester! I know! This is how good I am at magic! Check me out. Are we leaving here or not? I am really attractive right now. I came over here to give you the blessing! It helps you with your stealthing! You're welcome. Okay, that's it. But I'll see you outside at some point, okay? Don't be scared, come up to me. SAM and Sure! 14! (whispering) You go first! Oh, god. Oh, everybody's leaving and I didn't have a partner! But I feel like you guys are noticeable and why would I be this really beautiful woman leaving with the stinky guy? You're my daughter! Yeah! You leave after us Caleb, okay? No, me and Nott are going to go together. Okay, come on, Nott! Come on sweetie, let's go. And we walk out. We did it! Where should we go? Okay. Should we walk toward the carnival where the zombies were? Oh, right. We should find out where he's from. How do we do that? Should we ask around and say hey, anybody know where the old guy came from that turned into a zombie? Let's go to, is there a market area? 16. "Ye olde." It came up out of the lake for some reason. It really happened. I almost died. She did. A little different. Well, he took some jobs with them. Did anybody see him the day of the carnival? Was he working with anyone that day? Where's Ye Olde Mud Hole Tavern at? It's okay. She's my daughter. She loves whiskey. I don't even remember what voice I was doing. (laughing) I let her have any whiskey she wants. Oh, that's pretty good. 17. It's okay. I have it. Sure. (high-pitched voice) I mean, sure. Do you know who was talking to him the day of the carnival? Was he here that day? Yeah. Do you know who he was doing odd jobs for that day? Where did he sit in here? I go sit in the corner. I'm going to look for anything I can find that looks like an old man was touching it. Okay. I'm really good at these. 12. Is Fabio on the cover? Is there pictures? (in high-pitched voice) Is there pictures? Oh. Sounds exciting. What do you guys think? Should we stay here? Should we go somewhere else? In his defense, every carnival I've gone to has said no sick people, no old people. Right? The guards are really weird. Like, you know, they-- What kind of weird? (laughter) Great, so we just need to investigate the guards. Do we need to question the guards? Maybe we should tell them they can't leave town. We turn it around! MARISHA and What? Do we still have Disguise Self up? 11. Looks like we're ahead of them in the investigation. Oh shit. Let's see if I wrote it down in my sketchbook. King Bertrand? Okay. What about-- no, I know that guy. Nope, I didn't. We could go by there. He worked out there, right? MARISHA and Do we look like ourselves yet? It's us! (in normal voice) Pretend that I don't talk-- (in human accent) Pretend that I don't talk like this. Have you seen any zombies coming out of the lake? (whispering) Enon turned into a zombie. (louder) Enon turned into a zombie! (whispering) And was killed. Really? You're welcome. We saved a little girl! If you see any zombies, please let us know. We would, definitely. We already killed a zombie too! Oh, we have one of its fangs. I pulled it out. Only bigger. Fuck. Sure. I feel like we are really doing bad at this detective thing. I feel like going back to the carnival is probably a bad idea. Rinaldo! Do you know where Enon lives? It's okay. See? We're better investigators than this guy. Hey, 14 year old kid! Do you live here? Did you go to the carnival? Okay, where were you at the carnival? Right, that's a good thing. Were you close to Enon? In the show. Were you on that side or the other side? Did you see the zombie? It was kind of crazy, right? Have you heard any ghost stories around town lately? About scary things happening? Oh shit. Those guys are scary, I've heard of them. You should be really careful. Have you heard anything about zombies? Caleb has seen some shit. Hey, listen, if you hear any other ghost stories, you come and find us, okay? All right. (laughter) Yeah, I believe you completely. That was very believable. I'm going to give you another blessing before you leave, okay? It's true. I know. We didn't ask anybody, we went straight to the house. Should we run back, or should we saunter back? Yeah, I figured it had already happened probably midway talking to the kid. All right. I put my hood up. Is it a two-story? Let's do that, yeah. We'll sneak around the back of the inn, and try to climb up the upstairs window. In the front. Then we're going to try to sneak-- Frumpkin point two. Hello? Hold on, I'm naked! (whispering) Yeah, I don't know. Do you want to put clothes on? Should we take our clothes off? No, I just wanted to make them wait. Okay, I'm dressed now! It's a power play. Sit! Come in, please. Oh hello, I wasn't expecting you. Can I ask you a question before you leave? Are you guys going to be the same people coming back tomorrow? What is your names? Jonas and Lucas, very good names. Yeah, that'd be good. Girls would go crazy. If you guys want to play some games tomorrow, we'll just be here! I shouldn't have offered the game. What if we want to leave and then they want to take us up on the game thing? No, I love games! But what if we leave and then they want to play games? What time is it? I don't either. I'm going to run up and down the stairs for a while. Okay. When? Maybe we should go out at two o'clock in the morning and see if we can find them. Follow them. We can always leave through the window this time. How is a cat going to lift up a rope? There, that would work, maybe. It might be down before we come back, is the thing. Oh, we went there. Okay, but where did you see the cloaked guys? How would we let anybody know? Let's risk it. No tape?! So that we'll know if someone tried to come in the room? Okay. What are we going to do? Leave through our window? To their window? Nice. Yeah. Either way, I liked it. Let's sneak out. Towards the north end. No, you don't. But I can do it to everybody, one by one, if we get to an open area. 21. Yeah. I'm going to go with Fjord. What? Why, are you interested in him? No? Well yeah, he's a good friend. He watches out for me, I watch out for him, you know. We're a good team. Like you and Caleb. Natural one. I don't see shit. Fjord, can you see it? No, no, no. Okay, okay, okay. Oh, we should talk to the girl. Yeah. Maybe it was Yasha. While we're still trying to figure this out, I'm going to take out my painter's kit and draw like a little piece of poop on the side of the building that we're next to. No it's like a mound of poop. Oh I rolled really low on this one. Four! It's poop, I should've-- I should have drawn a pile of poop. I draw a pile of poop next to it. It's dark okay?! I can usually paint much better than this. It's really dark and my hands feel a little numb. Fuck it! 19. Oh shit. Go in the lake. Quick, go into the lake! I walk into the lake and crouch down? I really had to pee! Okay. Oh okay. I get out. I stand up and slowly dredge out of the water. (sigh of relief) We'll take care of you. Don't worry! And Molly. 18. Molly, I have a question. What made you guys set up your tent here? In this specific area? What if they set up their tent on a cursed land or something? (bird call) No problem. Has it ever happened like this before? Anything weird ever happened before? Are you drunk? What's going on? You can talk at a normal volume. I like you, Desmond. I think you're great. Can I try something? I want to try to cast Detect Good and Evil. Right? On the area. It lasts up to ten minutes, so it's within 30 feet of me. No. TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and Nothing that's been desecrated? Yeah, it follows me. Yeah. Am I close to the edge of the main tent? Okay. And they're closer to the big tent? Where is the big tent? Okay, cool. Yeah, let's leave. I'll get up to the edge of the big tent, and I want to see if I can feel anything weird in that area. I'm going to give Molly Blessing, so you get advantage. 12. Quick, go in the tent. We all duck under the tent go and act like we're sleeping. That was close. Tell us you know something. While she's doing that I'm going to try and sneak out the underside of the tent to go to the big tent. Nine. I freeze. Can I use-- oh shit. I'm going shitballs, shit. I'm going to cast Charm Person on the guard that sees me. Yeah. Hi, I'm not here. Okay. Sit down. Go to sleep, this is a dream. That's so close. This is so bad. Five. You want it to be a dream. Okay, well it's good enough, I guess. I'm going to go towards the big tent just so I can see if I can sense any evil. It's not, yes. I can sense something. Let's go in the tent. What if it's just a dead thing? Okay. Let's go under the tent. This the big tent that you guys were just in? Oh! Maybe he's a good fiend, can fiends be good? Is he still sleeping? He's still sleeping. And ask if he's good or bad? Oh no, we suck at this. 17. No, I don't. Which of the things is the fiend? It's definitely the large fiend. It's the big guy. And her name is Toya? Let's sit down on the ground and look non-threatening. So we sit down cross-legged. Just casual. Like we're having a tea party. And then we go Toya! Toya wake up! We're here to talk to Toya. Hi! Oh hey! What's going on. Last night. It was scary. You have a really pretty voice. Did you notice how when you sang that a dude turned into a zombie? Probably not. Do you sing all the time, Toya? Right. I understand that. What language is it? What does it mean? Granted sparks of life. Does that sound like a familiar story that I've heard before? How did you and Kylre meet? Man, we suck at this. They're new? Oh. Okay. Anybody in weird cloaks? Okay. Let's go! We've got it, we've solved the case! I thought we were stealthing over to the main tent. I wanted to get to the main tent to see if I could sense any evil in the big, main tent. But if it's really far away. Oh, god. Please no one, please no whammies. TALIESIN and Natural 20! I'm sensing it. No fucking evil! It's Ornna! We know you guys are in a fight all the time. You! Why did you turn that guy into a zombie? The first whisper! Insight check on the-- Seven. I think she's telling the truth. I did get a very evil kind of vibe off him. Well, I mean, he's a fiend. The devil toad guy. He's a fiend. You guys know he's a fiend, right? (whispers) Can we peek outside of the tent and see what's going on? Oh no. We have to fight them. Totally. That's right. So we definitely can't fight that thing. Oh my god. Yeah, he touched him, didn't he? I thought he did. Hey, bonus news, though. The charm spell guy isn't going to turn me dead! Whoa. Tight tight tight tight. I wanted to cough for her.
