Ooh! Nice, nice! We've been opening doors for him all night. I'm Lady Briarwood. Here with the man I broke the world for. That's right. You should say who you are. Nice! That's right. More than betrothed. I'm not dead. No, man. LIAM and I guess. Well, I am dead. No, I am dead. Exactly. I misunderstood. You're the only person alive. And you of course. Cheers, Victor! Get your maps off the table, Tyriok. These are from October. These are not the current ones. Okay, that's the coolest. Yes, I think. I have to see if these are actually usable or not. The chopsticks are awesome, but don't try to pick up metal dice with them because they're way too heavy. LIAM and That's right. You do! There's some good stuff happening in that episode. Yeah. There's been some really phenomenal-- Yeah. And Brian's a really awesome guy so we're excited about it. Congratulations! Look directly below. Maybe stare at his eyes. No, we're at the top of the ravine. Did you want to sleep before we went back to Whitestone? I think you look great, Matt. We need to deliver Ripley's arm back in Ank'Harel. That needs to happen. Kashaw's in Vasselheim. We need to do something about him. He might be back. He might be on his way here. Hopefully, he won't just loose something on the Ravenites here. Hi! Let's get on to Whitestone. Get on getting on. No, like two days because we slept there. Our loot. The castle? Scars still on the face? She hates that! Oh no, we're going to start a fight, that's going to start a fight. Oh shit. Where are you off to now? Lovely. Oh, good! Allura, we haven't seen her in forever. Have we? We did. Shit. Yes, we did. Never mind. Good job. We should put that hide in the Treasury. The 140 pounds of dragonhide you're carrying right now? Yeah. We've got a couple hours. It won't be if Asum has anything to say about it. Improvise. We're good at that. I hate knowing that she's going to be able to hear all of our plans. Yes. All right. It's got scales all over it. I mean that stays, right? It doesn't have to be kept cold? Kept cold. Would it be an armorer, or a blacksmith, or-- who works with dragonhide? Is there a tanner in Whitestone? He's cheating on you, Keyleth. (shushing) Not just yet. Yeah. We need to find Kashaw. Before the meeting, yes? Kash? (loudly) Are you sleeping? I'm going to jiggle the lock. Is it locked? I open it. Just a crack, and look in. Shh. Should we let him sleep or should we talk to him? He snores. You know, my brother doesn't snore. No, just don't, just don't. Do I have any like stones or any like rocks or anything in my bag or-- Yeah, just to see if he wakes up. Well, I don't want to kill him. I'll sneak in, tap his shoulder, come back out, see if he wakes up. I don't want him to know that, you know-- I want to sneak in and tickle his little foot and walk out. Shit. All right, I tickle his hands. Tickle his hands and then go back really fast to the doorway. Fucking-- I flick his nose. I know; it's awkward. LAURA and Oh good, I was wondering if-- Okay. Ooh, that sounds big. They're so hard to get a hold of. We should probably focus on the other one. Unless Vorugal's already dead. What would we do with these contracts if he is? Just wondering about that. Your help has been-- Do you want these back-- I'm going to set them down on the ground. By the way, you might want to get like a mouthguard or something because you snore a little. Keyleth, we should go. Keyleth. Come here. And I take her around a corner. He kissed me. No! God no! Percy! Percival! No. Yeah! I know. I mean I know you guys are like-- Pretty close and I don't know if that's weird. I don't know, you're like his sister, kind of. This is true. How are things with you and Vax? Thanks for bringing it up. Is it good? I care; of course I care. I hug her. Well not your antlers in my face. Hey thanks. We should go look at the treasury. Oh my god. Do you think he'd mind if we-- I mean we have so much money, we don't even need to do that. Yeah. No. It's-- It's all good. So bad. Sometimes they do talk about boys. 5000 gold is a hundred pounds? Oh. (laughter) I want to stay standing as well. With the Gate scroll that we showed you, actually. Allura, is everything okay? Have you been through some shit, Allura? Just pop on over to Emon, then? Do you want to offer yourself as bait? I don't know how we would use it. We can't touch it. You think? I feel like Raishan would only know how to open up a portal. What?! How the fuck are we going to fight him?! We're sending ourselves as well. How long did it take you, Allura, to create that heart? Six months. How do we get armies there? But they're just townsfolk. March on Emon? If we gather our forces, Thordak will notice. Bless you. Do you think it's overtaking him? It's huge. Maybe all the evil things in the Fire Plane are gone right now and they're with Thordak. That is a shame. A real shame. Shit's going down. Did an airship ever arrive? An airship? Did anyone see an airship flying around? Mm-hmm. That would be good. Yes. Yeah, it's really far away and, then as we were leaving, the people that we talked to about it-- But we need to know the ritual! We've got Allura and Gilmore, and Drake. Whitestone's about to be destroyed. Why would he? He doesn't-- That's different. Taliesin! Oh god. Are you going to leave that on the whole time? Just the helmet? That's good. You're good now. I've just been staring at Allura. Either way, we can now ask about the ritual. That's crazy. Will he know it was us? So what if we kill you? How does Thordak know you're alive? What if he sends you out, and we kill you? We do it to everyone. Don't worry. Doesn't always turn out well, Percival. Raishan, now that we know you're you, do you have to continue the ruse of being Asum, or can you bring him here? Maybe you could pop him over then? Just for a little bit. You're quite powerful. I want to hear what's going on with the Clasp. I want to see for myself that he's alive. I'm a dragon too! (evil laugh) You thought you were going to stab him! That was not a play! No tricks. Not long, Cassandra. And if we had told any of you, your life would have been in danger. Mm-hmm. Oh yes. I think if we give her access to Thordak's body afterwards, we're asking for a lot of trouble. Question. What if we do actually just kill her? When we fake that we're killing her, what if we kill her? Should we continue this conversation downstairs? (gasps) No! Are the walls still like people? They're really clean naked bodies now. Where it should have been happening. It's true. She actually revealed her entire form during the battle. Which is quite diseased. And then we try to defeat her after that? But we have to beat her to it. If she gets a hold of that stone-- Yes. Are you suggesting we put the vortex of doom inside one of us? Right. No way to transport it? None at all? Think about it. If we could get that stone next to the vortex, he'd be fucked. This is a temple to Ioun, right? The goddess of knowledge? Brom? And he's in Emon, potentially? Brom's with Asum? You couldn't have used the gate scroll in here. Yeah, that's what I was thinking, send him in. I don't know if we have a lot of time-- Pike. This is true. Well, that's what we've been doing this entire time. That's not a magic creature though, it's a woodland being. Really? Just a fairy. Just a teeny little fairy. Potentially. We'll find out. (copying Marisha) Lalittle lilittle li-- A little pixie. Isn't it, though? You don't know where it goes. Stab stab stab. It's just an empty pyramid-y thing now. Wait. Hey Allura, how many things did you throw in the orb? Have you put a box around it? Just encapsulated it completely? You've been waiting! Waiting to find a time to say it, haven't you? What about Fort Daxio? Fort Daxio has an army gathering there already, right? Well, Syngorn is gathering their forces as well. We have. We haven't been to Fort Daxio. I'm sure they already have. No. She knows. You took that shot specifically to stab her three times in the back, Percy. I thought you were practicing honesty. Let's be honest. Raishan wants Thordak dead. That's her endgame as well. She's not going to show up. Your people, Keyleth. J'mon. We could take out a contract against the red dragon. We can hire them to kill a red dragon. She doesn't know Fort Daxio. She doesn't know any of that. She doesn't know about J'mon Sa Ord. They're keeping an eye out at this point, all right? Keyleth, we have to fight eventually. We're not trying to be cocky about it; we're trying to set up an army! This is true. If the opportunity arrives to take out Raishan, then we do it. Beforehand. If not, immediately after Thordak is dead. After this fight, there won't be enough people to bring us back anymore. (laughter) We need to figure out if Fort Daxio is the place to send everyone, all right? We got to fucking check it out. Beep beep. Right there. LIAM and
