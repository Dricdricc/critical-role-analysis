Oh, really? Everybody spices at Burning Man. I'm pretty sure. The fastest things ever! Because you bite Goku through the game. I don't understand it. They look really, really awesome. Shebang! This is the blood splatter one. There he is on the inside. That's so awesome, man. I have a feeling you would rock the nails, wouldn't you, Liam? What? Anywho, also available in the store tonight is a plethora of new merchandise for you guys. I know we've had a lack of it lately. Okay, I've got to say it all because it's really exciting. Okay, we have these badges, they come in a set of five-- Oh, I took yours. They come in a set of five, they were limited edition at Comic Con so we have some left and so we put them in the store. They're super awesome. So those are available right now, but they are limited. What's the other thing that's limited? Oh, the nail wraps, right. We also have the rings back in stock. Don't, baby, don't flip off everybody. So those we have a limited amount of-- Don't! I had a fly on my food. Oh no, you really did roll a one! Those are limited. Also, something that's going to be in store for a long time is my favorite thing ever, the Critical Role mug. As seen on Blindspot by Patterson. Yeah, so we finally had these in the store and these are made to order, but they are going to stay in the store so order them and whatever. In addition to those, we have things on pre-order that are going to stay in the store for a couple weeks and that is this amazing bracelet. You can check it all out at the store. It's there right now. It says "How do you want to do this?" it's got our logo on it, how badass is that? And these are on pre-order too. You know you can't see them on this shot, I'm sure it's not close enough, but you can go on the store and you can see an awesome view of them and they're enamel pins of our logo and also a "How do you want to do this?" So you can put them on your jean jacket or your backpack or your hat. Like flair. You can wear them on your apron if you work at Bennigan's or TGI Fridays. So that's all the amazingness that we have. That's a lot. Yeah, I really will. Who didn't silence their phone? Oh, is he here? No. No, no, no. Oh, be pleased. He knew who we were. What do you think it means exactly? We are making headway. We've taken down one. They mostly come at night. Yes. A great ancient red one known as the Cinder King is sitting on Emon. By a green dragon, Raishan. It's replaced his heart, potentially. Not unheard of. Certain. How long ago was it? He could have grown by then. That is the question, isn't it? We're collecting items. Vestiges of power. Hopefully with them in tow, we will be able to gather armies to combat Thordak. We know we can't take him on alone. Well, a couple. It's only a matter of time. If we can't defeat them in Emon, he will spread his territory. Well, we don't run into the furnace willingly. What is that? Ugh, come on! We just got here! Why don't we have Fassbender with us? Sam, we're all going to die! Anybody? 25 to 20? Wait, let me see. Oh, I think he got something good. No. 17. Oh, I was wrong. 14. I added wrong. Shit. 14 as well! All right, here we go. And then a fucking 20 again as soon as I-- What are those clear blocks? Are those glass? 14. Thanks for the reminder, because now I'm going to do Hunter's Mark. Yes he does, he does piercing damage. But it seemed to get through less than-- Where? I don't even see where we are! How tall would you say this guy is? He's 15 feet tall, Grog. 15 feet. Oh my god, is this is the dice that was fucking you last week!? No! Accio Lightning Javelin. He just lost the Lightning Javelin out the window. Okay. I like how we're clustered right there. It's fun, it's really fun. Yay. No! Oh no! Area of effect. Yeah, Scanlan, do that! Oh no! I hate constitution saving throws! 19. Oh no! How many is a lot? On a 19? I didn't save? Yeah, basically me too. More than half. Is he within five feet? Can I get away from him? I'm going to hope that he doesn't hit me and I'm going to try and run away from him. Okay, does he? He hits me. Watch me die right now! If he kills me right now, I'm going to be so pissed. Oh my dear lord! I'm going to run around behind the throne but I'm going to shoot him as I'm doing it. I'm going to shoot him from there and then I'm going to keep going. But I'm going to shoot him with-- hopefully, the lightning actually does something, because I'm going to shoot him with the Lightning Arrow. And I'm doing it at a fourth level. So I roll. Attack as normal. Okay. Oh no! Shit, what is that? 22? 22. Yeah. 19. Oh shit! Keyleth, I'm so sorry! No, it's a fucking lightning arrow, I never use it. Just eight little old points. Yay! See, that's nothing! Now you feel alive. And I'm going to keep running and go behind the throne. I'm going to stay right there. Okay. Sure. He's metal. He's made of metal. Yes! Please let this work. It's enough to heal up and get ready. Yeah, Grog's coming up soon. I like how his name was Kevin halfway through the limerick. He'll get a swipe at you. Yeah, this is true, but at disadvantage he still got me at 25 before. He's got so many. Is that what you said? "My free action! Yeah!" What? Why are you going to-- No! He's going to aim at me! Yeah, good! Good job, thanks. So you hit him and he looks over and I'm standing there. It's the best. That's the best move. Ever. I'm right behind you, you did hear it! Come on! Push him out the window, Grog! So he's going to choose dexterity. Yes! How far can you throw him? Knock him prone! Oh no. Yeah. Oh! Tell me I'm just out of reach! Fucking shitballs. (singing) It doesn't matter, even with a save I'm going to die. Awesome. I'm unconscious. Yeah. I'm straight up on the ground. I feel like Matt, he wants me to die. He makes me unconscious in every fight now. No, Matt. Nope. Matt wants me to die, I can feel it. Oh no, I failed it! Oh shitballs. Oh no! Oh Scanlan! Oh. Yay! Yay! And I cough out blood. Yeah! TALIESIN and Yes. Do it, giant earth. Exactly. Why would you throw that out there?! This. Is. Yes! So high. No! I hope everyone's okay! Can I stand up? I've been watching this whole thing from the ground going Yay Grog! I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself there. At 3rd-level there. I'm at 28 hit points now. Oh no, what are you going to do now?! Never. When we call your guardian, is that how you'll know that we're calling you as well? I get it. I'm really smart. (coughs) Also, like a big giant gash right here. I'm going to hold it together. For now. He means "be pleased." His Trapper Keeper. I like that everyone has a Trapper Keeper. Krylon? I don't know how to spell chateau. I really don't know how to spell it. Sick. Backwards. I'm going to keep holding my slashed-- Right, yeah. Oh, thank you. I'm in the thirties now. So sorry about that. Can we look around for it? It could be around. I'm going to ask the Grand Maven Flying, is that sort of weird here, or is that totally okay? On a broom, maybe? I don't want to do anything that's wrong here. I feel like I might be able to see it. Percy, point me in the direction. I'll fly and get it. Can I fly? I feel like I could fly down and get it. Point me in the direction. Hold tight, Percy! I'm holding onto one of his wrists as I'm flying. No, Percy, you're totally fine. I throw up, too, because anytime I-- I'm going to keep my hand on your wrist, Percy. I'm going to try this fancy little dice here. This is a one. I'm going to blame it on Matt Abernathy. Thanks for that opal dice. Yeah! He got opal dice and it-- okay. That's okay. 13 perception. Damn it. I zone in and I notice that I accidentally puked a little bit on Percy's head. And that completely distracts me. That's got a tiny bit of puke on the top of his head, and I feel so bad I can't focus on what you're saying. And I throw up again because it's so gross to see. You were so smart with your math and I-- Someone is going to find a really expensive weapon. Oh no! No, I hope not! And the mystery, it will just be unsolved mysteries, they'll never know. They're going have a documentary on Making a Murderer. Sorry, Percy, I'm so sorry. No, but it was your hair that I threw up on. I mean! And I take some-- You know, if you hadn't thrown up to begin with, this would have never happened. Man, I rolled a one! [break] What time is it? I'm going to use another spell and heal myself some more. You do? That's still. That's potentially ten extra hit points. What's the codeword? I have a question. Do you really think this is a smart move, considering that a brass dragon just gave us our aid and asked us not to fuck anything up? All right. We're cool, Scanlan. We're cool. Oh, they are! What if they find it on you? Give it to us. If anyone comes and tries to take you away, we'll present it and say that we're higher rank. We've seen you turn into a triceratops and fuck things up. We trust you, Scanlan. Well, we know it happened. Seen the tale throughout the mansion. "Love-a the spice," huh? Are you sure this is even a drug? Did you say what the spice was? All right. You'll do a wonderful job. You're so cool. Should we get in fancy casino clothes? Because I feel like we'd dress up for it. Is it shaped like a pyramid with a giant light coming out the top? No? I cannot wait. Yes, can we get changed? Do we have enough time? Awesome clothes! For casino. We are hitting the club! We're making it hail! Now it looks like you've been sweating a lot. You look so cool, Keyleth. Can you glamor me to not look like I have a giant slash through my chest anymore? No. Well, I guess I'm walking by myself. Oh, Percy, do you want to look like you have ladies? So rich. All right. And then me and Keyleth are on Percy's arms. Wow! Stealthing like a motherfucker. What does that mean? Okay, I understand. Already? I'm looking for craps. Is that a one? Oh no! Keyleth, don't get arrested again! That was really cool, Keyleth. I'm not putting any money on Thordak. I'm going to put 25 on the second one that doesn't have any bets. The one that you said hasn't-- 25 gold as well. All right, no, I don't want to look like I'm putting down the minimum; that's pathetic. 25 gold. You've got to spend big to make big, Percy. Oh, that's adorable. Go underdog! Natural one. Do I get anything for second place? It takes everything in my power not to keep betting, but we should probably walk away. As we walk around, we keep an eye out for Scanlan's red shirt. Yeah! I want to use my gold dice. This game. Yes, that! I can't actually remember what you said the rules were, so what's the minimum bet? Okay. And then you add, you can double your bet to add-- Okay. Then I'm going to put 25 down, just to see how it goes. Okay, here we go. Oh, I'm marking. Okay, what am I rolling? 2d6. You got it. Where's my other? Of my life. They're gold dice, they're the gold dice. Eight. Oh god! This is a hard game! You lose really easily! To get to 12? All right, I'm going to double my bet and I'm going to throw one more dice in the -- 50 gold, yes. Aw, it was almost a four! It was a five. No, it's fine, it's really super-duper fun! He didn't even look. Ooh, 50 gold back? You should try it again. You've made money now. You should. I tip her two extra gold, because that's what you're supposed to do. Did we see him walking up the stairs? 15. Is the gambling only at the first level, or is it up higher levels as well? I think I'll, after a little bit, grab a drink and then-- Yeah. What was it? What does it look like? The cedar wood chips. Oh, you rolled really well. It's a spice. Oh, shit. Oh no! I'm going to down mine really fast and then take another one to go, thanks. Let's go back to the rooms. Come on, let's go back to the room and do some experiments on it. Yes? Grog? We head back to the hotel, to the inn. Let's set it on fire and see what happens. It looks like wood. Does it taste like it would be good on a sandwich? I don't know, Grog. Can I walk downstairs and find the innkeeper? Hey, Treev. Hi. I'm looking for a meal. I'm a little homesick. I'm hoping you have a meal that maybe has some fusaka in it? Oh, it is a pricey spice, yeah. Right. Of course. It wouldn't do anything to your body if you had too much of it, would it? Probably. Right. Tell you what, I'm going to save the money. I think I'll hold off on the fusaka for tonight, but maybe later. Thank you. Here's the thing, he said it's an expensive spice. Maybe it was worth however much you spent on it. Tell me how much you spent on this. Oh, 50 gold, that's a lot, but I think it should be fine. You can make 50 gold back betting in the casino later. They said it could make your stomach upset if you've had too much. Have you had too much? Oh, he drank the whole thing! Is that the wine that was like-- Grog's wine? Scanlan? Oh no. We should get him to bed. We're still waiting to hear back on Mistress Asharru? Yes. So we can't leave here. The one with the cloak. But I have to say, I'm glad Jarett didn't send us on a mission to get drugs. It's quite out of character. Leave him alone. He's pathetic enough as it is, really. Yeah. Yes, please. Any word back from Mistress Asharru? Yeah, thank you. Scarf down the breakfast! How you doing, Scan? What does it normally look like? I mean when you're using it in food. Thank you. Are you finding anything, Percy? Can I wander over to the big hole in the ground and ask one of the guards Oi! What's in there? No worries. I'm from out of town. I just was very curious. Oh. And the Allegiance is the people who live here? No? Of course, yes, the schools for magic. I am not, at all. Right. Thank you for all of your helpfuw information. Helpfuw? Helpful. There's a big hole in the ground. They're esc-excavating something. I don't know what's happening to my brain! Scanlan, hold up that necklace. Are you Headmaster James Kryon? Be pleased. Could we meet with Headmaster James Kryon? We've been sent by someone very important. J'mon Sa Ord. I've never heard you speak Gnomish before, Scanlan. 350 gold? Why 350 gold? Why don't you walk that fast, Scanlan? Oh no. Why? Oh no, that's such a long time. We have a very short amount of time; we're on a crunch. Can I insight check him? 20. Look, we're in a bit of a rush. This is very important business. The fate of the world rests on your shoulders. I'm not terrible at it. 20. Fucking little gnome on a power trip. Is the fence still between us? Our second Vestige. Fenthras. Did anyone in the Allegiance create these items? I pull out the tea set that has LM engraved on it, that we got in-- Can we ask him how he got his purple hair? Because I want some purple hair. Look, Sam, we have a Critical Role mug! Oh, really, they are so smart and magical-- In your scholarly knowledge, do you know how to kill a red dragon? But this isn't one. This is several. You ruined your business deal. Have fun. That guy was a dick. This is true, but he was a snob. No, a little bit more. We need to find out who this mage was. Maybe she's really old. They respect you. We need Cabal's Ruin. But we don't want to cause too much of a ruckus, because I don't want to put ourselves at odds with J'mon Sa Ord. Access to a library? This is an entire area of mages! You don't think they'll notice when you use Polymorph? Yeah, let's make our way over that way. Maybe she's taken the cloak off and we can take it. That's where we're staying. Scanlan, do you need to go find a house of lady favors? "Hey can we have your Vestige that's super valuable?" I have no idea. Maybe wait until she comes to find us? Yeah, let's do that. Me? Are there any other people around? 16. 32. Should we go peek in the window, maybe? Maybe you, since you're sneaky? Oh yeah, or that. Scanlan, you can turn into a bug or something. Ooh, I can use-- wait, does this have to be-- This doesn't have to be attuned. I have, from a long fucking time ago, the cloak of the scuttling rat. It doesn't say. No, I don't have a cloak attuned to me because-- Is there a fireplace? What about the little thing where the note got slipped in? Maybe she hasn't been home. Did you see any sign of life inside the house? We could be breaking into somebody's home for nothing. We're on a time crunch. Let's make shit happen. Can we look around? Is anyone around? Can we pick this lock without anybody knowing? Do I see anyone around? Can I check for traps? Oh, well. That investigation was a 12, there. Okay, I'm going to try to pick this lock, Scanlan. Yeah, I totally checked already. I'm going to try and pick this lock. I'm going to try real hard. What do I roll? Add my proficiency bonus? I don't understand. I have thieves' tools! Oh, my dexterity is another five. I think that's a 14 that I rolled. Just go inside, unlock it from the inside. But don't tell my brother I couldn't unlock this, okay? Do you have thieves' tools? Then go fuck yourself. You can't. I try it again. Natural 20! Oh no. It's an alarm. We need to get the fuck out of here. No, I did. I checked! 16? (gasps) Leading from the door to the trapdoor? Oh shit. So the trap could've done something to somebody before? Do I see footprints around? There was a trap. I think there was a trap on it and I didn't know. But I looked for traps! There was a flash. Does that sound familiar? Is there any blood on the inside of the door? Does it look like it was trying to open the door? Does it look like it got the door open, or it was stuck inside? Oh, the trapdoor. I go and grab our note that we sent and take it. Oh, somebody else got the Vestige. I look around. Any evidence left behind of who it was that attacked her? I want to see if I can find something left behind by the killers. I bring Trinket out and have him sniff around. Can I have Trinket sniff around for anything that doesn't smell like her? For other people? Advantage on smell. Maybe Mistress Asharru wasn't wearing the cloak. Maybe she happened to hide it down the tunnel. It was over a week ago potentially. She could be long gone. Did Trinket smell anything? The guard at that one place. I feel like it was her. I want to play more! Oh, I rolled a seven! I know, but I want to play this game all the time. I just rolled a seven. I'm counting as a win. Yeah and then just gamble. Yeah, you lawyered her out of jail before. Thanks, Loot Crate! Don't forget about the awesome stuff that's in the store!
