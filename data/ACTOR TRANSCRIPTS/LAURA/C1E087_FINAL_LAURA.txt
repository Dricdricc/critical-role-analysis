Oh God. Terrible. Oh man, I hit up Bennigan's a lot. But it's so rewarding, Matthew. I play Supergirl! Super happy. TALIESIN and Let's not call it a hazing. It was an audition. I guess I've been trying to get to know Tary a little bit better. And also flying like Vex-Kite behind the ship. Like land, potentially? I guess I'll fly down and-- I'm gonna try and stay off the deck as much as possible, since it makes me so nauseous. Yes. Potentially, yes. I know, right. Vex hasn't had a lot of experience with ships, you know. I may have fed a couple sharks in my lifetime. I'm gonna fly down and tell Captain Adella. Oh. Oh, it could be another ship, possibly. All right. Captain? You'll get used to that someday. (laughs) I see something on the horizon; do you know of any masses in the area? Maybe a ship, or island, or-- Do you have a telescope? May I take that and fly up? I swear I'll give it back. I've got nowhere to hide. Up. (screams) First one, first one, first one. Which of you? Okay, okay, okay, okay. Shut up, don't say it out loud! Shut up. 21? Motherfuck. Well, I come back down. It went under water, whatever it was. Does that mean it was big enough to be some sort of sea monster? Was it a sea monster? How quickly do those things move? Sea monsters. This one was very large. I wanna go back up and keep an eye, with the spyglass, on any kind of movement, that looks like it's coming towards us. Oh wow. Wow. One of those things you put on your wrist? Yeah. Basically you're blowing really hard. We're gonna be so fast for a minute. Nothing? This is so ridiculous. That's right. (gasps) Can I look down in the water? I'm gonna land in the crow's nest with Percy. Yes. Just keeping watch. Yeah. I don't feel as nauseous up here, it's nice. I know, it's nice. 18. Uh, pretty distracted for Vex. We're not having sex, we're just talking. No! Just chatting. Yeah. Yeah. TRAVIS Oh, okay. No hand action, no hand action. Oh, shit. Is this normal? Is this a sea monster? I wonder if they can see through the fog? It's a little crowded up here, but-- I hop on the broom and get out of it so he has more room. It's moving! Oh, shit. I just pull out an arrow and get ready. I'm going to tie off a rope to the broom. Did you say it over the earring? Like it's invisible? Does that mean you choke? Can we see the hooks from the crow's nest? I want to try and hover down so I can see a little better. Yeah. Get it off the ship. Can you pull it off? Trinket's going to run up next to Grog. Oh, shit. That's just mean. Keyleth, can you do anything about this fog? I know! What if they are? Look at that! Yeah, really, it does. This is insane! This looks so 3D! This is so cool. They can fly. They can fly. Oh my goodness gracious. This is so cool. What is this? What is that? -- a new land! Yeah. Me and Percy had said we were sort of on our way down. Yeah. Oh. Uh, I was going to. I wasn't going to go all the way to the other boat, but I can. If you want to go with us. Toy boat. TALIESIN and Oh, no. 18. Eee. Yeah! Hey, look, some things don't change. (all laugh) (gasps) What if this is the Ashari? Did we say we did anything about the fog? The fog is still there. I was on my way over to the other-- -- towards the other ship. Okay. Percy wants to be dropped off at the crow's nest, so I'll fly over that direction. Keeping an eye out for anything visible that I can shoot at. Flyby. Yeah. Uh-huh. I'm on-- yeah, I'm on my broom. I'm just riding my bow around. Can I drift down to where I can see anything and I say to Keyleth, Uh, fog? Can you do anything about the fog? Yeah. I like that one. 31. Oh, jebus. Then, I'm gonna try to Bramble Shot that motherfucker. I'm gonna try to shoot a Bramble Shot at him. Okay. 20? Yes. Okay. Oh, Hunter's Mark. Motherfuck! That's okay, sneak attack. Why? I can't help it, I get so happy. Okay. That's cruel. That's okay. That's okay, I'm gonna try to do another shot. And in that downtime, I'm gonna fucking Hunter's Mark. Okay. I can't do a Bramble Shot again 'cause that was wasted? Or does that mean-- Does a Bramble Shot only work if it connects? Okay. Okay, I'm gonna try. 19? Yes! Okay. 15 plus four lightning damage. Plus Sneak Attack. Woo, an 11 for the Sneak Attack and Hunter's Mark. And then the DC of 17 or be restrained. That's strength save. And I'm gonna do the Bramble Shot damage now. Hoo, yes! He's restrained. Ooh. Is that a sev-- that's a one. 16. Awesome. And I say, Percy, spellcaster, right below you. Fish guy. Oh, god! I get 2d6 now for Sneak Attack. Another six! Bramble Shot, motherfucker! Ooh. Oh! The fish guy. And it'll probably get a chance to be unrestrained as soon as it's his turn. We're kind of being ambushed. So... I don't think your cousins are fish people. Oh, my. Nice! We could steal this ship. Okay. You might bring our ship down with it, Keyleth. No, but, the chains attaching two ships. Oh, shit. Like Xena. (war cry) What does Xena do? (Xena fighting call) Left and right. Damn! I like to picture you in full armor with boat shoes on. They're really pretty. Nice. (explosion sound) Is he not grappled anymore? Oh, shit. Ooh, honorable. Maybe they are. What is he doing, what? (gasps) Yeah, I'm fine. Whoa! Trinket rolled so good! Hold on, hold on, holda. Hoda, hoda, hoda, hoda. 20! He was very zen about that duck down. Matrix style, he's diving in. No. You guys! Well, we're having a pirate battle. Yeah. Oh, no. (gasps) Bro! Gosh, thank god Trinket ducked. 18. Bearly. Shank shank! It's just two. It's shank shank. You're attacking the guy? How'd you get all the way over there? Yes. Awesome. Cool, then since he's got my brother next to him, I'm gonna fly down so I can see him better, and shoot him two times with my blazing bowstring on the first one. Blazing bowstring! Activate! Do I still get disadvantage? Okay. 28. Second attack is just-- can I do regular? 18. 12 with three points of lightning damage. I'm about to. 13 additional. And then ten with the blazing bowstring-- nine more with the blazing bowstring. And then my second attack-- 11 plus three lightning. I don't get Sneak Attack again, but I do get Hunter's Mark. And three more for Hunter's Mark. And I'm gonna fly back a little so he can see me less. And then I'm going to have Trinket, for my bonus action-- -- run forward and attack the guy on the edge of the ship. I know, I know. Yeah, because it's my bonus, so he can just do one attack. Oh, I could? I didn't think I was allowed to do that. I want him to do that. That's what I wanted him to do. Athletics... is that strength? That's just five. So Trinket just stands up, he's got his paws on his chest. Growls loudly into his face. I mean, that's scary, a big bear. Especially if these guys are on the sea. They don't see bears very often. Oh, no! That one was seriously bad. Trinket attacks him on the way over. Damn it. We're all such dicks. He's a fish! That'll help him. I don't think putting him in the water's gonna help us very much. You could get rid of the fog. Get him! Is it listing towards Keyleth and-- Oh, nice! Yeah. That we see? Oh, fuck. One of our guys? Oh, shit. He is untameable. Why a demon? Okay. I'll fly over to Percy, who's on the fucking ground. And I say, are you good? Lovely. Get off this boat. And I'll fly over and try to help out the fight on the other side. Okay. And then I'll shoot some arrows at-- I'll shoot 'em at the guy. Yeah. Oh, disadvantage, too? Oh, damn it. Okay. Yeah, but. 20 on the first one, and 15 plus seven on the second one. 22. Awesome. Oh, Jesus, this is terrible, this is terrible. 17. Plus three lightning damage. And then... 16 plus two lightning damage. And then for my bonus action, Trinket's gonna-- and it was Sneak Attack, because there's something next to him, huh? (cackles) Five for sneak attack! And then Trinket will attack him too. Okay. Yes. That is-- what is that, a bite attack? Sure, it's a bite attack. A 24. It's 11. Good job, boy! Yeah, it's great. I wish Scanlan could've been here to see that. He's had more than one. No. If this doesn't end it... Hey! You almost lost that gauntlet! I know, if there were slaves-- Fingers crossed. Let's not do that to Keyleth. We really should've kept one of them alive. Yeah! What if there's a map to treasure? 30 seconds? Yeah! I want to fly down and help Percy investigate. If there's time. You might. Did you ever hear that I wanted to go help Percy investigate, was I able to do that? Anything interesting? What are you listening for? Can I hear anything with my elven ears? What do your elf eyes see? Oh, nothing. It was a one. That was awful. We should get out. Don't drown, Percival. Shit. Okay. I want to go help if I can. I help, I help, I help. But I wanted to see the prisoner-- -- are they okay? I mean, did I check them out while I was-- Okay. Well, I mean, I had him on my lap as I was flying back. I wanted to make sure they were okay. (gasps) Oh no. I roll him on his side. (vomit noise) And he's dead. Dead dead. Oh no, you keep scooching back. Pat, pat, pat, pat, pat. Yeah, well, I cast Cure Wounds while that happens, so go fuck yourself. I feel like we're finding Percy all over again. On a boat! How long have you been in that cell? We're your saviors. Can I insight check him and make sure? I just don't trust anyone. Ooh, natural 20. Wow wow wow. Oh it is, it's Hotis, it's Hotis! Don't worry. Your captors have been defeated. You're safe. What's your name? Tempest Fang? Weeks. Ooh. Again, again! Oh, but do you just wanna hang out over here? 'Cause Travis is just gonna fuck with your shit again. That would be so cool. Can we get some food? I was talking back to Captain Adella or one of the crewmates. Not you, Grog. First Mate? Was he a pirate? Forgive us, we have to be a bit wary. Plus he's so frail right now, I'm afraid Grog would just break him in half. Yes. Do I see any, like, Clasp markings on him at all? Those scars on your body. Were they from before you were captured, or after? What were they doing to you? Yeah. I asked if they would bring him food. I asked him to bring food. Because he's been in a cage for two weeks. They didn't feed him very much. Thenton, you will forgive us if we don't give you free rein of the ship while you're on here. We'll promise not to poke you. (laughs) Of the Ashari. A-- Yeah. Defeaters of dragons. No big deal. Trinket gets up and starts dancing around like he knows what to do, when we say we're performers. She's a sailor, too. That's all right, he can stay on the boat. Yeah. We'll give him food. It's all right, right, Captain? Captain, have you heard of the Tempest Fang? Oh, really? -- 17 other companies. Oh, yeah. I put them in the Bag of Colding for the time being. Pull it out. Shit. Do we understand? That's great! You can Identify things? How many times a day can you do that? Are you an arcane user? So basically it's you. You can use it. I mean, hold on to it in case we run into Scanlan again. Or you can use it. Oh, I have a spyglass, I didn't even need to ask for Captain Adella's. That's cool. Super useful. Deedee? Cool. No, we have rooms. But they're combined. I don't know, you've been tinkering a lot lately. No. This is that night, yeah. I did want to talk, but that's okay. I can talk later. Yeah no, I was going to. TALIESIN; Well, I was going to say, you're welcome. We're finishing up, you're welcome in. Oh! Only when you're finishing up. Hello? Is it filled with smoke in here? Oh, hi Tary. I didn't see you. Fun! Exciting! On a boat, even. Wow. So! What'd you make? (laughs) Oh. Oh, shit. That's powerful. Oh wow, you guys made a-- Wow. It's a lot, it's just a lot of spots right now, but I'm sure. Eventually. Oh! Pretty. Um, get out. You, not you. If you don't mind. I mean, of course you can stay-- (quietly) Hi. So, Percy. I've been meaning to bring something up to you. At the risk of bringing up Scanlan again-- Something I'd rather ignore. When he left, he said something that caught my ear, which was that he heard. He heard Pike and his daughter, calling to him. From the other side. Which is strange really, because when I was on the other side, I don't remember hearing anything. What about you? Busting out the Courage again? Mm. All right. I'm not embarrassed. (laughs) Well, that's good. I would hope he's not waiting on the other side for you. What about when you were killed by Raishan? You can always tell me your fears, Percy. I don't, I suppose it depends on them, doesn't it? You don't think they were doomed to suffer the same fate that you were? Oh no. (gasps) Maybe we can just try that on someone who we already need to kill. Right. (laughs) Are you listening? I'm sure that's how they feel. No one's ever sure they're doing the right thing. No, it's all right. Takes the pressure off, really, knowing that you know. Yes. So serious. (exasperated voice) You can go play with Tary some more if you like. Great! Then you can play with me! (all laugh) We go running up. Oh no. We're at a reef! Broom. Trinket will get in a boat with Grog. No! Trinket's gonna be in my necklace. Yeah, for a minute. No, he can't. It's too heavy. It's too heavy for the carpet. Get him on a boat. Get on a boat, Tary. (laughs) Mm. Mm-hm. Uh-uh. Nah. Keyleth! Oh, he has legs? Man! They must have the pruniest feet! (laughs) (yells) Do. Not. Kill. Got it. (laughs) Because he makes the lodestones. Basically. Is there something that helps those of us who don't breathe underwater breathe underwater? Yes? No! We are going to-- -- We're going to steal some kraken's poop. (laughs) (excited shouting) We're gonna drink most of it. Yeah. TALIESIN. Don't. 'Cause we don't kill the kraken. C! Oh my goodness! Oh my god! Ew. Rad! Definitely. On Tuesday! Totally real. I know!
