Feel better? No, like you're not so much right there. Oh. It is a functional weapon without sharpening. I have; I can't wait to shoot. He almost died! How did you do? Please to be following you. We're going to have very skilled people branding us, I'm sure. Perception? Let's use this one. Oh, that was great. Oh, even less. It's a nine, total. Oh, there we go. We must be branded in the dark, Tiberius. Oh no! All right, fine, I'm behind him. Pardon me, Vanessa. I thought you were just a band of hunters? Let's do it! There's some weird stuff up high. No, like eyeballs. Is it like eyeballs? Is it moving? Oh, okay. It's that carving right there. looks like an eye. Does anybody know anything about anything that looks like eyes? Can I try? Natural 20! Does it look like anything we've seen before? That was a really high squeak. I look at Grog, like what? I nod. It just happened?! Like that? Not going to lie, it looks pretty cool. Can we insight check and see if she's telling the truth? 24. Has the glass totally faded? A little warning next time, Vanessa. Maybe. Can she see through our eyes now? She's not going to be happy with what she sees through Scanlan's. (laughter) Yay! I like the way you talk, Vanessa. I respect that. Very noble. I thought I caught all three. I really tried. How much is in that one? All right, we'll divide it evenly. So we have a home here. We have rooms here. We don't have to pay for lodging? We're staying here! Does it do dances? I'm confused. Oh. So you killed something that was human-sized, then. Because we killed a dragon! A big white dragon. Giant big giants. Yes, we fought them both. Oh, you did? You did? I've always liked your human form, Tiberius. I thought it was very attractive. Almost died. Percy, be honest. Oh, you did? We did not. What was he like? He? I'm assuming it was a he. Keyleth. Lady Keyleth! Well, now that I know you're interested in some cleric, I don't care. Well, who wouldn't be, Keyleth? You are gorgeous. I'm bummed we had two ladies with us. Oh yeah. In fact, we should probably take the carpet back now that Grog has the Bag of Holding. All right, go. What is it? Yeah, fly over the acid pit. Right, and then you pulled up, and you jumped-- But then you saved it, and it was fine. It looks a little less... glowy, though. (shouting) You lost the carpet?! The carpet-- It's okay. We'll just pool our funds together. You guys didn't spend any money during your mission, right? We can pool our funds together and maybe find somebody. You didn't spend any money? You should have kissed her, Percy. What should we do? Do we have enough time? You didn't pick up blue shit? It's a very good blessing wherever it lands. I'm sure she had gloves on. You had gloves on, right? Well, what should we do? It's true. We should probably go see your family before we go to Kraghammer. Oh my gosh, do we need potions. Just go and buy some potions. Wait, does the Slayer's Take have a nice stock of potions? Oh, yes. Funny thing we used them because it was a dragon. Do you have any more? Is Zahra still in the Slayer's Take, or has she left? You guys really needed to meet her. Tiberius, you would've liked her a lot. She was red. Very powerful magic. And eyes. Let's go buy some potions. This guy. No, please. Yay. What should we do? You go find a blacksmith and we get some potions? Do you think maybe that you could maybe start out on a journey with us, and then head back if you need to get back to the temple? (gasps) I did not! Oh, Pike. Do you want to keep it at the temple? Just rub poo all over it? Ooh! It's true, you have some sort of thing where you do it with a spell where you can ask her to help us? You should do it! Come on, Sarenrae. Oh, look! Look at all these. Combined of the two? Oh, good. We can try it every day while you're with us for a week. That's seven times! Kiki? Is that what you called her when she was your wife? Try it! It's like fishing wire. No, keep it, Pike! It'll be with you always. If you buy a lot, you can put them in your Bag of Holding. That's what I do. Speaking of, how's my supply in there? Is it pretty good, still? My arrows in the Bag of Holding. While they're shopping, I just want to drill Keyleth a little more about her smooch that she got. So wait, he kissed you or you kissed him? He kissed you. A cleric kissed her! Do you know who his deity was? Maybe Pike knows him! And he kissed you? Wait. A guy that's married to a god kissed you. I shouldn't have even said anything. Was it good? It was a good kiss? Can we hear this at all? Don't tell him all the numbers. (laughter) You're such a dick! One use, or is it multiple? Can he get multiple drinks out of it? Wait, you fucking-- track him down. Do we see him? Are we walking up? Can we walk up as it's happening? What guy? I Hunter's Mark him! What level what? Level-3 Hunter's Mark. What did you do? See? I'm glad I Hunter's Marked him. What did you trade? What did you get? What is wrong with all of you?! I need a drink. Everybody's breaking things, everybody's spending all our money. We don't have it now. We do, we have a keep! We have a beautiful keep, with furniture, and servants. Don't tell him the price of anything. I love you, guys. MARISHA, ORION, and Maybe start the trip with us? Are they your family, technically? So these ones are Fire. (belches) Oh. Let's go. Should we go in the morning, or should we go now? Let's go now. All right. Small nap, and then first thing in the morning. Who's there? Hi, Pike! I'm so glad you're here. I tip him five gold and I give him a wink. Little baby dragons? You going to have a little pet, too? Oh, thank you. Trinket looks very interested in Lockheed. Trinket, get some vegetables in your diet. He likes meat, what can I say? Lockheed. Can you speak with animals, Keyleth? So, it's groggy, but we decided to go see your family, right? Right now? We're going, Keyleth. I'm sure they're all as charming as you are. So remember that way, we found a hydra, so we might come across some terrible things. I flag down the nearest person. 15. Okay, stay on the road. No, wait! We'll be on the lookout for key things in the landscape to maybe give you information for your maps? What's your name? Tyriok? Oh, yeah. Yeah. We fought a hydra, Pike. Like, five heads. Parchment. We will use this to make notes. Don't we have horses from our previous-- But we have enough horses for all of us, from our previous run. Yeah. Let's just take those horses. We don't even have to pay for them. The back buckled? No, he can't. Okay, so we need two extra horses. Okay. Let's go find a couple of horses. I'm going to ride Trinket, so we only need one extra horse. Yes? I go get a horse for Grog. Well, we'll say we're covered though, yeah. Oh, 400. Darling, remember who we are. We gave you excellent business before. I have no idea what I'm saying. I think, as a return customer, you can offer us more of a deal than that. Come on. Natural 20! (shouting) Of course. Half price is a very fair deal. Grog. Pay the man. I was going to ride Trinket so that there were three for them. Yeah, me and Pike will ride Trinket. Tiberius, I want it to be known that if you keep asking me for party funds, I will not be so-- You're so charming today, Tiberius. He did. (laughter) I'm a little concerned, Tiberius. I'm afraid that some creatures might be attracted to that light source. It might actually be best to-- Light the end of your staff. Ooh, it would be smart. We've got another day's travel tomorrow. The Hunter's Mark that I cast on that merchant. Did he stay in town, or is he out and about? Can I sense that? Six measly little hours of travel. I can track it. No, I'm just seeing if I can track the dude I put a Hunter's Mark on, is all. I try to get Trinket to eat some vegetables. Trinket! Your uncle said your poo is runny. You need to eat some veggies. Can you use bulette armor to make more bullets? Another Heroes' Feast? Wait. How long does it last us? Okay, so until we go to bed tomorrow. This is amazing, Keyleth. Isn't that good, to roll a two? For a day? Tight! You've got a lot of drool in your beard. Zero means ten. That's a hundred. That's the best you can do. Let's go! Leftover from the big feast. Does it look natural? What do you think, Keyleth? Does it look safe to traverse? Do you think that's where they are? It looks good on you. Maybe your mother's still here? We'll pretend to be your small army. You are our leader. 15. Oh! Is it favored terrain? Oh, is it still mountains? Wait, why are we taking the more travelled one? Do you think your family is more reclusive? We tied them. Nine. I pull my hood up. Do they look-- Fuck. I chose poorly. That's terrible. Yeah. Eight. Shut up. Whoa. 15. I did not roll for Trinket for either of those things. You're so annoying. Well, they know now. Can I-- I mean-- What was my number? It was 13? 13 for me, and Trinket gets 13, as well. Oh, are they giants? Are they more fucking giants? Can we get in a place that boulders won't hit us? If we get right up against the cliff face? 14 on the first one. I try to hit him with an arrow. 16. Yeah! 17. I didn't Hunter's Mark him. I pat Tiberius on the back as I pull him along. Run! 12, man. What is our rolls tonight? Really bright in here. We dig? We dig down? Can we dig? And I bow. Can we assist? How? Would you like us to follow you, Your Majesty? Got it. This is really not necessary. How long was she here? Can I check him to see if he is telling the truth? 22. We'll do this together. Oh, shit. Are we doing this? Trinket! Jump? Come. I smack him on the butt, and I jump in after him. You're brave! Very brave! Well, we follow footsteps; I can track footprints. And I want to use Primeval Awareness. Can I use Primeval Awareness to see if there's any aberrations, celestials, elementals, fiends, undead? Any scary things? Dragons? Within six miles. No. A mile. (quietly) There's no way to stealth here, is there? Cover ourselves in ash or something to make us less visible? Is it possible to cover us in ash and try to make us less visible to the elementals? I do have Pass Without a Trace. I can cast that on us. 22. That's pretty. 17. No. Don't. Oh no. Jeez Louise. Oh no. 18. It's addictive, isn't it? 16. How do you put yourself out? You're on fire. That's good. Trinket definitely saved that. Okay. Can I back away from him, or am I going to get hit? Okay, so I back up. I'm going to back up against the wall so I can duck behind it if I need to, and I call Trinket with me, for sure. And then I am going to lightning arrow him? I'm going to lightning arrow-- no. Jesus. I Hunter's Mark him! Now he is surrounded by all of our friends? Balls. I'm going to have to Hunter's Mark one of the little ones, then, and aim for one of them. And I'm going to Hail of Thorns them. The one closest to me. That's a 25! All right. Why do I already forget what I'm doing. Normal attack. Okay. 17 for the normal attack-- Plus Hunter's Mark damage. Six for Hunter's Mark, and then I get 3d10 for the Hail of Thorns. Okay, that's a ten, that's a ten, this is a ten. Balls. Ten, 12, 13. 13. And just one more regular attack. 20! (cheering) Oh, that's it? I know. 14 for the second hit. That's a lame critical. Nice! The other wall. All right, I'm going to lightning arrow? Is that going to do anything to fire? I'm going to lightning arrow the one that I've Hunter's Marked. So that is 19? Okay. So. Do I do my regular attack on that, as well, or do I just do the damage from the lightning? Okay. Correct. 4d8. This is so nerve-wracking. (counting) 25 on the lightning arrow. Oh, 14. Oh. I didn't realize you were there, Grog. I'm sorry, I couldn't see. I didn't think that was ten feet. I'm sorry. Oh good, that's nothing. Two! I do another attack out of the Blood-Seeking Bow. (singing) That's a 27! (laughter) ASHLEY and Yes. 16 with Blood-Seeking. He's a bleeding fireball. Waste. I'm going to go around the back of the wall with Trinket. Oh no, I knocked it down on myself! Can I get around to the other side? Okay, that's cool. Scooch my booch. We're coming back. No! 16. He's at 12. Sprinter's Boots? I come around the side of the wall. Hi! Oh hey. And I shoot at the other guy. Is he within ten feet of anything? Then I'm going to Lightning Arrow-- I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. Yes, so I'm going to Hail of Thorns him. Yes. 15? Yes! 17, plus four, so that's 21, plus 3d10. 14. Take two! That one doesn't hit, though. 13. Yay! 16. 20. He's like one of those creatures at a gas station. (laughter) Did you complete the mission? I guess it's time to go. Nine. We're a little further behind her. (laughs) Which one? That's good. That was better! 18. Pike, what'd you roll? One! Me and Tiberius rolled ones. Oh, that's it? Well. It's easy to get us confused though because we look so similar. For how long? Forever! And also a lot of water. (mispronouncing) Kaitiake. Kaitiake. Any moment at all. Yeah. (choked sob noise) Explosions! It hurts every time, Pike. That's awful. Thank god that dragon didn't freaking attack us. We're going to be at SacAnime next week. The three of us. And I'm going to be at PAX tomorrow and Saturday, so I'm leaving tomorrow morning to head up to Seattle. Go say hi. We're doing a crowdplay of Tales from the Borderlands on Saturday night. You should come.
