Yeah, that's right. It's not for seeing at all, I don't... Oh my gosh. Music works, you guys, music works. Oh, this? Okay, so I get to announce who the official winner is? Oh my gosh, this is so exciting. Okay. So the official winner of the first Critter contest is... Against the Chroma Conclave, designed by Antmageddon! (cheering) Go you guys for voting on that, you rock, even with shenanigans. That was a mixed reaction. Right now. Wait. Before we go into not-regular announcements, should we make sure that people know that we're not having an episode next week because of Comic-Con? I'm sorry, guys. I feel like the first thing we need to do is go see our father. He's the one that's going to give us access to the rest of the city. Oh seriously, so like... no, no the guard is following us. What time is it? I mean, we don't know what time it is. Thank you, Percy. All right. Okay. So many elves. Hey, Grog. You should really watch that gas of yours with him back there. We have guards fucking following us. We have to go find our father. Ish. Keyleth, shut up about Garmelie! Yeah, sorry Keyleth, your ears aren't large enough. Me, too. It's hideous. Yes. No. No fights. No. I can't imagine you were. Is he here? What time is it? Is Velora around? Of course. It's everyone. And Trinket, you remember Trinket. I wink at them as I walk inside. And Velora? Where's she? Surprise! So you intend to go back? You're amassing this army to go back and join the fight. That's wonderful news. Do you think it's possible? I want to pull Velora over and sit her in my lap. I want to insight check him and see if he's really saying-- 26 on him! Being a giant dick? Oh, you poor man. When do you plan to attack? You're joining other armies. You don't plan to fight Thordak on your own? His intelligence is very low, Grog. We don't need or want anything from you. Oh, well. Yeah. We got what we wanted, which is access to the city. We know you have no love for us. Think of those you do love. And I hug Velora. Don't you want to make her safe? Do you know of anyone that has traversed more of the Feywild, that would know of what we might expect? It will. More than that, isn't it? Of the Conclave, we've killed two. Umbrasyl. And. What was the other one? Blitzen, Donner? What was the name of the other one? Oh, it was General Krieg! The blue one. You-- headphones, dear-- you fucked some random woman in a city you passed through, and you expect us to feel sorry for you? Why? Why pull us away from her if you had no love? We would have been happy with her. If I could pull the blood of you from my veins and give it back, I would. I want no part of you. Well, fuck. Guess he's not into us now. Oh, headphones, darling. Oh, shit. I mean, shoot! Darling, he takes blue sparkly poos! I don't know what you're talking about. You should really control the people in this city from talking about that, because it's weird. This is a belt buckle, why are you passing me this? Okay, oh, it's a sealed scroll now. Yes, yes. Well, you didn't know. (laughter) This is a belt buckle-- oh. (laughter) Yes, but we'll be in Whitestone. Poo is a really terrible word to say, I think. Good thing she didn't say any of the other words that she heard in here. Oh, and! She is. I pull out one of my owlbear feathers that I picked up with Zahra and I tuck it behind her ear. It's an owlbear feather. I know! (laughter) You keep that behind your ear, and you wear your necklace, and you never forget that Vex and Vax love you very, very much, dear. Of course, come visit me in my baroness... isity. Good day. I run up and I give Percy the biggest hug. Percival! Wait, is it real-- no. Was it all just to-- Even so, Percy. I thank you so much. That's stupid. Speaking of, wait. Where the fuck is Pike? Great, now we'll never have them as a sponsor. Thank you, Travis. Actually-- Guard! One of you, could you go get us some food? We're very hungry. As a baroness, I'm very used to getting food when I want it. Thank you. I want anything but chicken. I feel like we don't need an insight check to know he was lying. Where are the pockets? Think of gold. Think of gold, Keyleth. Why do you say that like it was a bad thing? No, don't check the fur. I feel like now we already know where the outskirts of the Shademirk are. What the fuck is that? That's the stupidest thing. Because then they can't go back! Do we know what her hat looks like? What does it look like? Wait, like a Robin Hood hat? Like Peter Pan! That's it, that's all you need? No, it's like they stole his gold watch. Why did you take that? He's an ambassador to the city. Ugh. If he does, we never saw it. Yeah, he can talk a lot. What? No way. He knows Allura because he knew the Council members. He was the one that sent us off to find... No, he's an asshole. That's totally fine. No, feel free. Totally, totally. Well, maybe we can ask him about it? That's real sexy. Pretty hot. Should we sleep before the meeting? Yes. Let's "shedule" the meeting. Is he back from getting us food? Oh no, I hope he's not, because I want to send a second one out there. Because I'm a baroness. Hello! We require a meeting with the High Warden. "Shedulable." That's your bed, Keyleth. Yeah. Trinket jumps up on the bed and snuggles in with him. But we just need a sliver of one. They might not be able to return. I wouldn't risk it. Yeah. Maybe somebody, maybe the High Warden knows. Maybe we can sneak it out of there or something. Exactly like that, Grog, exactly like that. Does anybody have money for a tip? Because I think you're supposed to tip them. It's delicious! Are you coming with us, though, Keyleth? Just come on, then. Fuck them, that's what I say. Okay. Yeah. There were four of them. And also what we might face. And how we can fight what we might face. Yes, exactly. We do. We have a meeting with the High Warden Tyrelda. Is she wearing a hat? No. I wouldn't mess with him if I were you, just to be safe. And I walk up and I give Trinket a kiss on the nose and I put him in his Pokeball. Just watch closely, buddy. Just talking to my boobs. No big deal. We're back because we're searching for a certain bow, Fenthras? Said to be within the Murk something? Syldor sent us here because he said you would know what we might face in the Shademirk. Sounds lovely. You say you've lived here. I know the city goes back and forth between the Feywild. Do you travel more freely? How did you make that transition so easily? I know that the threshold crests are how the city gets around. (laughter) Well, I don't want to be a bother, yes, but. Do they entail any part of those threshold crests? I'm wondering because perhaps we might find ourselves in need of traveling, as well. Oh, do I want to roll this one or do I want to roll-- Okay. Ooh! That's a good, that's a good, I'm glad I switched! 27. If a party would be in search of an item that would be of great use to your survival, would that be worthy? Stop bringing up the bastard part! Which one? Him or me? Fuck, can I give him advantage, can I help him? Come on, you motherfucker. Wait, no, everything's ten. I thought everything was a ten! 12. Why did you talk? I think she would've listened to me. (laughter) Why did your luck suck that time? Have you seen the tree yourself? We have to make that shirt! We appreciate your time. Trinket's in my necklace. Trinket does nothing but stare outside of the necklace. I pull out my hat and I put it on. Do we see the hat that we're looking for in here? Are they all just jumbled in together? I nudge Vax and I point it out. Are the guards in here with us? I prat-fucking-fall. I pratfall right in front of the guards, on the opposite side of the room. I walk to the other side of the room and I just fall over. Oh, shit. Can it be acrobatics, though? Shit. Okay. 19? I want to take some shit down with me. Ah, oh god, did you see that-- I think there was a marble on the ground. Ow, I think I hurt my wrist! If we could just see a gift shop, I would be thrilled. Ow! No, lost and found is a wonderful place to go. Awesome. 19. Come on, natural 20! Can I try to do an arcana check to see if there's anything magic in the room? Oh shit, I just rolled off the table. How did I do that? 16. I can speak with animals. This place fucking sucks. All right, I grab something random, too. I mean, if we're all doing it. Come on. Roll for value. No whammies. Ooh, that's neat. Mine. I'm writing it down. We're down to one! Oh, do we find any broken threshold crests? Damn it. All right. Thank you. Good day. That's it? We could seriously like fuck it up, what if they can't get back? They have an entire army to help fight Thordak. You make a very good point. A very good point. Maybe we should just go fucking check them out. This dusk is really making me-- I mean, is, is anyone else super duper tired? Are you guys tired? I look at the guards. I mean, are you guys tired? I mean, how do you even know what fucking time it is, right? I would love to get some sleep. There's windows though, yeah? Super duper happy, all together. Yes, it's been quite a while. I'm rather hungry. Perception? MATT and Deception. Oh. Ten? And the squirrels. Yeah. That was definitely worth it. You passed by those threshold crests several times, I'm assuming. Yay! Woo, that was really fun. Good. That was really... I think we made a really good impression on this city coming back. Duskward. Tangleward? Did you say tangleward? Oh. I just thought of the Disney movie and I think I spaced out there. Onward to the theater! Okay. Four times since we met. It's been 14 hours since we've met. Wait a minute, you could-- if you know a tree is-- that would be pretty stupid, to just pop out of the cancerous tree, but if we know a tree is there, couldn't you potentially just fucking do it? Wait! Keyleth, what if you just open up the cancerous tree, we reach through, we grab the fucking bow, and then we're out. Wait, I think the edge of the bog is kind of far, though. Oh. (belches) (laughing and cheering) Thank you. That's a baroness burp. I pop Trinket out of the necklace. Yeah, get it! It's okay, darling. It's okay. Keyleth. Do not yell at my bear. Wait, no. I have Landstride, which means I don't slow against any land. No, wait. Yeah. Good job! Wait. Why do you recommend the Moonbrush? What is the Gilded Run? Right, those. Yeah? Are you okay with that, Scanlan? Do the lycan tend to populate trees, or if we stay up high can we maybe avoid them? Well, there you go. Ukurat or Udurat? Wait, he used to be elven? He used to be elven. Mandrakes? Okay. Do I see any kind of markings on the obelisks? Oh. Get out of here! Natural one. I know! I suck! I pull the broom out from behind my back. Is it Draconic? Is it anything that I recognize, though? Elvish, Abyssal, Undercommon. Shit. Who's you two? Shit! I grab Keyleth's wrist and I fly into the air. A strength check! Come on! Is that a saving throw or just a check? Five. I cast Speak With Animals! Yeah. (weak growling sounds) (laughter) The cheese is old and moldy. Yeah, well, I-- Ooh, yeah, that's pretty good. I offer him a tea set. Good job, Keyleth! Yeah? Oh, fuck. Trinket! I call Trinket. I call Trinket. He's pretty cool. Oh! (cheering) I don't know. Thank you, Loot Crate!
