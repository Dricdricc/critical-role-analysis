Is that what you said? It was so wonderful! We're an 80s cartoon, guys! Wait, I've got one thing. Oh well, I was just perusing our store recently because sometimes I do that. It is full of good stuff, but something I noticed that we haven't announced is that the rings that we had forever ago. The d20 spinner rings? Those things are in the store right now. I don't know if we found a stockpile of them that we had missed, but there are some in the store right now. Just so you know. I know, we just found some, I guess, because they're there! There's a bunch of other stuff, too, t-shirts and stuff, but the spinner ring is there for maybe five more seconds. Maybe. I don't know. That's so sexy. Ew. We wake up all cuddled in a pile in our room. A little cuddle pile. You don't sleep with the daggers, Kiri. You want to remove them. We should have taught her that last night. I would like so much of whatever you have, please, thank you. Ugh. That's a long time. To the stables. We run for it and we get the table first. This table is taken by The Mighty Nein, but if you need anything, there's other tables. I like your ribbons. You're not. I've never seen anyone in a dragon mask before. And this is a bird. She. She walks around. She's kind of the best. No! Probably not so much like that. And the green. Mm. Weird. That's crazy. Yeah, well, anyway. What it is that you need with that, though? Is it the people in the dragon masks that want it? Is it your underwear? It's a soup bowl, then? Insight check. Insight check! A soup bowl used in rituals. (tinkling) He's incredibly trustworthy and he worships like crazy. Because he's had them wrapped around his weenie. Like a full dragon? Well, he's going to take us where we need to go. She's Kiri. They need more sugar here. Gators. Giant ones. Cali, did you hear any howling in the swamp, because we heard there were howling monsters? Jester Fancypants. Just the one, one nostril? You know what, I appreciate that you're so accepting of everything, Febron. Trinkets are pretty great. Yasha! I'll write up a release form really fast. Yes! Arms being chopped off. An axe to the face. I will illustrate being burned by fire. Pulled apart by gators. Probably something creepy and howling eating you as well. I'm going to use the colored ink from my mom to make it really gory. Here you go. You can sign this. All right, we have a deal. Welcome to The Mighty Nein! Lots of pocket bacon. Whoa, it's creepy! Yeah! Kill all of it. Kill the fog, Kiri. I have to live with this for the rest of my life. Oh shit! Kiri, come back, Kiri. MATT, MARISHA, and You have to be careful. There's lots of creatures around that could hurt you, you know. We should really give her like a sheath or something to put that knife away, Fjord. He has lots of fire. I will. It's fine, Beau. I'm going to carry Kiri on my shoulders. Yeah, so that she doesn't have to walk through the muck. How does she know there's a J in your name really? Oh, jeez Louise. It's just milk. We should avoid those, huh? Wow! Dang it, I'm trying to get to my bag to help you, but-- I can't bend. Whoa. Yes. Sacred Flame. Dex save. That was a dex check, yes? Toll the Dead! Damn it. We should really avoid those in the future, huh? I would. Woo-hoo, 13! (whispering) I hear something. I hear a chime. No, like little wind chimes. Like we had at home. Yeah. We used to hang them in our balconies. It sounded like that! Febron, is that where the thing is, that we're going? Oh, so it's not the safe house, it's another building, for sure? We should find out what it is. That's cool. Just in a tree. Oh, that's creepy. Our wind chimes were made of wood. Does Frumpkin see anything around, like any living things? Do you want to hold my hand? I try to hold Caleb's hand? Lumpy Frumpy. It's really good. That pile was definitely something sleeping. What kind of bones? Like gator bones, maybe though? I bet it was a friendly person. I'll tell you what, let's go to the safe house and then we'll come back if we are not completely almost dead, and see what we see there. Especially if there is no bowl in the safe house. Then we know some other place to look for it. Let's mark a tree. Oh, we'll find our way back. (singing) Let's go to the safe house then. Wait, hold on, let me look at what I have. I could cast Pass Without a Trace on anyone within 30 feet of me. Oh, so it would be super slow. Well, maybe not then. Maybe when we go back to the creepy tree, we can do that. I open my journal and start drawing him as a balloon. (shushing) Hey, there's a lake! Febron. Are there monsters in this lake? Okay. (splashing) Then I go back out. I just wanted to see. We just freeze? Maybe I shouldn't move forward. I stay right where I am. What is it? Maybe it's something nice! What's happening? Yeah, right? No sound at all. (loudly) What are you saying, Beau? (loudly) Maybe there's lots of them around too. I will. Got it. I am a fan of pie, Kiri! We are keeping an eye on the troll. The thing is, what if something bad comes in front of us and then they trap us? Because he's just following us. Maybe he has friends ahead that he's waiting on. It's a friend? I could if I made myself look like a little teeny troll. And they would want to be friends with me. What if we ran rope between a couple trees and then we tripped it? Man, trolls are so cool! Do you want me to do it, Fjord? Here, you hold Kiri then, because I don't want her to get too close to it. What are you doing? Why are you holding--? SAM and Is the troll just watching all of you go away? Should I try to Pass Without a Trace, you guys? I guess I will be falling back because I'm going to talk to him. I thought the thing was behind us. Okay, I'm going to pull the last of my pastries, which I'm sure are really fucking gross by now. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity and I'm going to send my duplicate towards the troll. It's skipping. Towards the trees, looking like she's picking some vegetation. I doubt there's flowers. But whatever. Yeah. Whatever she can do. I'm going to have her turn her back to the troll and act like she's digging around in the mud. Pretty close. I'm going to have her take a couple of steps away from the tree. She's going to step back towards the tree. Don't think it was friendly. Yeah. I think we should stick to the safe house, what do you guys think? I'll keep the invoke duplicity, the second me, skipping through the swamp at a distance. Invoke Duplicity lasts I think a minute, yeah. Beau needs to stop looking out for things. Yeah, I'll look. 12, I think. Yeah. It's right here; it's at eye level with me. Ooh, that's better. That's a 23. Ah! (chuckling) That was a one for me, I don't see it. But I don't wander too far from everyone else because there's a troll out there, you guys! I find that last one. 23! You haven't gone past these-- Shh! (quietly) They could be around! Hey you guys, I could try this thing that I've been wanting to do for a while, which is where I can talk to somebody that is not alive anymore. Yeah, the Traveler's teaching me all about it and I think I can do it. He kind of is, but he's really powerful, and he's super cool. He wears this really cool cloak, and he's got an amazing voice. Actually, hold on! I pull out one of my pamphlets. Here, if you want to learn more, you just let me know. Yeah, do you want me to try it? It's instantaneous, but I can talk to them for about ten minutes or so. Just one dead person that I cast it on. It doesn't have to be fresh, it could be really old. Which one looks friendlier? I mean, sure. Okay. Hi. I'm nervous; I've never done this before. Okay. I'm going to hold my symbol of the Traveler. I'm going to be like, okay, I'm going to do this thing. Kiri, be careful. Hey, you dead person, hey. I would like if you would come to life again a little bit and tell us some things that we want to know. (tongue waggling) (surprised yell) (screaming) Well, kind of! (tongue waggling) We have to ask it some questions. (low monotone) What did this to you? Really, are you sure though? Have you ever talked to a dead person? Beau, are you writing this down? How many swamp fishmen? Many, there're lots of them. There're lots of them that attacked. How long ago did this happen to you? I get five of them. Wow. Two or three weeks ago. Oh! Did anything that you did to the fishmen seem to hurt them more than other things? They bleed, but there's too many bleeds. I get one more question, what should I ask? Don't kill it again, okay Kiri? It's okay. We have another question. Or we could ask it what its childhood was like. Don't waste all your spells, you've got to fight fish men! Oh, he's huge! Just stapled to the tree. Technically! Oh no! 23. Okay. I'm going to Toll the Dead because he's been injured. I'm going to turn around and be like (splat). It is necrotic damage, but he has to roll a wisdom saving throw. So 2d12! I can help search for those in a second-- Six whole points! He has a loud ringing in his ears, damn it. Not flanked by Febron. I wonder if Febron is going to get covered in that pus that's coming out of him. The ring. You're 40 feet within him? Please don't waste all your stuff on this guy, because, you know-- Y'all, don't get close to this guy, because I don't want to waste all my-- I think it's okay because I'm going to have to use all my fucking spells healing you, Beau! Why don't you get back here? 34. Oh god, please don't pick up Beau. No! Goddamn it. --without killing Beau, because we can't attack it? No, but what if it makes it pus its thing and then it hits Beau and she dies?! Don't damage it! Do you have a healing potion? Can you just grapple it? Potentially. 20! Oh, so close! It's going to keep running away from you. Can I get within 60 feet of it? Awesome! I'm going to cast Healing Word on Beau. As my bonus action. Healing Word, so you regain 1d4 plus four hit points. Seven points! That was my bonus. But I don't think I can do anything. I guess I'll hold an attack, I'll hold-- Yeah, I'll hold Sacred Flame until Beau is dropped and far enough away. Maybe? Is she far enough away? Oh my god. When she is far enough away, I cast Sacred Flame. Okay, so you get hit with 2d8. Nine points! We should just let him go, huh? TRAVIS and No, you get disadvantage. Then get the fuck out of here. Can you try and hold on to the branch? I don't think he's going down with it. But we'd be idiots. Oh, there's a dead person I'm talking to! I turn around and run back to the dead person. Oh, this isn't the safe house? All right. I guess that's what I'll ask it, then, because that's all I can ask. Sorry, we got distracted, there was a troll that came and stole our guide. I think you might have known him. Anyway, which way is the actual safe house that we're trying to get to? Oh shit. We totally could have seen it! Well, at least we know it's 100 feet, so we can search for it. Do they have anything in their pockets? Investigation, you say? 14? I'm taking it. Are you going to check if it's magic? Okay. I'm going to use Mending on the note. Oh wait, it doesn't make the words come back. Remember, we already figured this part out. Shady grove. I bet the Shady grove. I'm going to heal you. Mm-hmm. My dead friend? Yeah, I think it might be hidden or something. Aw. Probably. Hey Cali, can I ask you a question? On check traps, sorry. This bowl that we're looking for. You said it was used in rituals. Were you ever used in rituals with these bowls? Who were the bad people? Oh, I know about re-- No. I don't know anything about religion. What kind of people? They are super evil bowls? I don't think being stuck inside makes you naive. I mean, I know some people that were stuck inside that know lots of things. That's not okay. I don't think the fish people like the safe house being here. Maybe this tree is sacred and it was being used as a safe house and that's not okay. Cali, can you make this water around the tree go away? Oh, no, that's really impressive. Caleb, can you do that, too? He can't do it, Nott. Should we try to go towards the tree? Towards all the dead bodies? Yeah. Huh? Damn. Yes. Are there any knots on the tree? Like underneath where the ribbon was? It's right here. 12. Check for traps, Nott. I'm going to move it then. Well, you and Beau and me did it. Aww. Right. You can do light? What if there's traps on the inside, though? Cali, you're so cool. Thank you! I love you. Are there any trap doors on the floor? That's where the fish people live! Are there fish scales on the ground? 17. Fish skin! It's tough. It's kind of salty. Smells like fish. I'm going to put it in my bag. I just open up the bag so you can see it. We don't let Cali see it. Sorry, Cali. We should send a message to Nott and see what she sees. Let's climb down. That's not a long fall for a cat. Can we start tying a rope off upstairs and drop it down? We've tied our ropes together and we're going to go down. What else are we going to do? Why? We can't leave Kiri up there. Who knows what's up there? We had it upstairs. Kiri! (shushing) Sit in this corner. (shushing) No. Sit in the corner, Kiri, right here. Don't move unless something chases you. Right. She's down here with us. Right. Yeah. Let's kill the fish people. Yeah! What if we all jump out at the same time and scream and attack at the same time. Like three, two, one. We shouldn't do explosive because-- Is this really the moment to talk about this? Oh, jeez. We're losing our ambush, y'all. Ten. Oh no. And then we jump out. Nobody? Nobody, huh? Six. I got ten. Oh, shit. No, like behind that little-- He's dead, he's dead! Too late. Sweet, then they end their turn! Oh god! That's what his spell is. Just within range? Until he's in range? No, remember? You looked at this before. But in the book it doesn't have darkvision. We did this last-- Damn, Beau's big. Okay. I'm going to run over behind Frumpkin, in that little alcove. Actually, that's a lie. I'm going to go next to Caleb. Yeah, back a little bit. Even more. Then I am going to cast Invoke Duplicity. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity! She's going to run forward and stand next to Fjord! Yeah, because that's my action. Still pretty cool, Beau, still pretty cool. They're still inside the tentacles? What are you at, Fjord? It touched the ground, that means it's cursed now. Hit one of its brothers! I'll be able to fix him in a second. That's great. Well, not all terrible. I'm going to send Duplicity me towards Fjord, and she's in her illusion going to hug him and cast Cure Wounds. I will call from a distance going, "Don't worry, Fjord, you'll be okay!" I'll cast it at level two. So 11 points. Then I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Spiritual Weapon right over top of the other fish man in the back there. 14 plus something, so I think that hits. So that is 1d8 plus four. Force damage, so eight force damage. Do you get one more hit? Wait, did you say it fell into the hole? Don't let it go into the hole! Let's get this guy out of the tunnel in case somebody comes through the tunnel. I don't want anyone to see him right away. Me and Yasha basically got it out. You did it. You killed them. It's a light die. It's not like a heavy one that wouldn't be affected by the magnet. 210 silver, you said? Okay. We'll do some math. Do you see any diamonds? Do you see 300 gold worth of diamonds? You said four sets of manacles? Really, people don't like it when you do these things, Sam. I wanted to look in the pools too. They were coming from somewhere. Who knows, there could be 20 of them on the other side of this. We're supposed to secure the safehouse. So anyway. I feel like we should check and see if there's 20 of them on the other side of this thing. Yeah, one person that can breathe really well. Fjord, you are familiar with the sea. Can you hold your breath for a long time? All right. How about you go-- Should we take a short rest again? Oh, it's another hour. Oh, you can only do it once a day. You're low on health still, aren't you? I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on you, if we're not going to take short rest, if we're not going to take a short rest-- On the other side. This makes me feel so uncomfortable. Oh my god, are you okay? What if the safehouse is that other tunnel? What if this whole thing is the safehouse? I'm okay with that. I just can't believe we didn't find that bowl for you. Why don't you want me to come here, please? Whatever. (gasps) Caleb, you found the bowl! I'm so proud of you. Yeah, Kiri's proud of you, too. What difference does it make? You don't have it in your hand anymore, Caleb. I don't think you should stop someone from talking to a god if they want to talk to a god. I believe you, Cali. I don't think I need to cast it on you. Oh! Well, I can cast Charm Person. Not all of us are shitty. Cali, be careful. There's trolls out there, and gators. Super-duper. Oh my god, I will send all the letters, Cali! That would make me so happy! I'm going to write you letters back all the time, okay? Hugs, hugs, hugs. What jewels? Be careful, okay? Yes, of course!
