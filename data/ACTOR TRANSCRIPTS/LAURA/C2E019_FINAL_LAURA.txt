Did you think that was going to be loud enough? No! No! Don't clap! That's so quiet. It's beautiful! Somebody wasn't asked. This girl right here. Oops. You know, there are other things happening. I totally was like, "Nobody asked me." All the oops. Sorry guys! Yes, and if they're still there, the Vox Machina dice set is around as well. I know! I tweeted it out because I was like, "No one told me that one was in"! That's exciting. Yes, I think we should go talk to him. That seems like it would be smart, right? Is it? What if what he wants us to do means that we have to stay here for a while, though? Like for a lot of money, would you stay? What if the table offers you four times the amount you've ever seen? Yeah! I remember he was trapped down by the spider. The ones we made fun of. Woo, go Thed! I'm going to jump up on the table and watch it. Jump up on the table, you can see better! Finish him! Does that happen often in here? Fight me! Fight me right now! Do you want to do it? Just hit each other! You piece of shit! 22! I'm going to punch her in the face and cast Inflict Wounds. At first level. I could do it at third, but I'm doing it at first. Yeah. 18! Oh no. 3d10. I think so. 17? I don't know! Oh shit. Yeah. No, it doesn't hit! Normally 18. I should have done it 3rd-level! Oh god. Oh no. Five! No! Six. Oh no. I think I pooped myself a little. That was my shield! Yeah. Oh no, it hurts already. I'm going to use my reaction, because I'm not stunned, to use Hellish Rebuke on you. Fuck! Oh no! Nope. Aww no! I'm unconscious! And then Caleb fucked me. (coughing) Whoa! That was seriously awesome! I would have done it worse, but I thought we were taking it easy on each other and then you went crazy on me. I understand completely. How come you were you hitting me so much though? Because usually you don't have that much speed. That was a while ago. Oh, hi Frumpkin. You're a little, evil creature that drinks blood! No, it's totally fine. I did it to myself. I don't like him. That was creepy. I'm going to use this time talking to him as a short rest. Well, hopefully-- Yes, we have, actually. Like swap creatures? Leading to Berleben. Febron Keyes. Okay, well the other side of that was that we would get access to some potions and supplies and stuff. Is this something you can provide to us when we go on missions for you? Natural 20! (cheering) I think it sounds like fun. Shadygrove? No, Shadycreek. Well that would be probably the second one, right? How do you feel about it, Yasha? Well, I mean, we're all leaning more towards this than going to the Menagerie Coast for the Empire right? That is as contract-y as contract gets. (gasps) It does! We can stop by Hupperdook! I have no idea! I imagine that all of the buildings look like mushrooms. Yes. We have to be careful of those monsters that came out of the-- It's not sweat. I think it's-- I'm going to peek around and look at the Gentleman. Is he moist? Eight. What kind of shirt is he wearing? The thing is if he was sweaty, then why would he be wearing long sleeves? He doesn't look like he's warm, though. Normally when people are sweaty they're going like this (breathing heavily) You know? We go in, we try to find Fabron Keyes and secure the safehouse in the swamp and there's howling there so probably wolves or something. Secure it and come back and tell him where it is-- Yeah, so we need to go to Berleben or we need to go to the swamp, come back here and then go. I think we should call them Dookies. What are we going to do if he's not? Exactly. Wouldn't it be better if we just don't know? The Greying Wildlands are in the north. I just want to make sure we're here for a full hour, though. I'm going to drink slowly. I'm going to sip it. I thought you get a point of exhaustion after Haste. Am I going to be able to heal enough what? I'll just use the one little spell. All of it. Hmm-mm. We're going to do that one and then the other one! We'll say yes to both. Not quiet? The passage that we were in. Poison and healing, got it. You will get 107 gold. Thank you. Well one and then-- Oh, I run back to The Gentleman. Should we come back here after the first part or should we continue on and take care of them both and then come tell you? That way you know we did it timely and we can get that bonus part. Okay. Yeah, we already packed our rooms up. No more Pumat's. As I leave, I flick the Wand of Smiles at him again. Now I feel guilty. It's cleared out. We have horses, you can ride a horse. Two horses pulling the cart. Five. We have six horses?! I'll drive the cart. I'll drive the cart. When someone kicks him and he poofs, does he automatically go to the other place or does he die for a little bit and come back? My mother never did, but the Traveler told me lots of stories. Of everywhere. There's faeries, and that is how the unicorns get over here. Do you have wolves? To the Swamp! I bet someone's going to try to jump out at us. They do that to people that are on the open road. That's really shit. We should probably pull over or something and look around and see. That's a fast burn, that's not going to last very long. We could camp on top of the cart because we won't be on the ground, it's warmer on there. I'll take first watch with him. Yeah. It's not awesome, but it's not horrible. I'm helm. Oh, goddamn it. 13. That was an easy watch, then! What, you guys? I was at a disadvantage! We're all camping together! Oh, you guys are still on your watch. It's so brisk and wonderful. Do you think The Gentleman wakes up with frost on his face or his whole body? I wonder if he has to crack himself. He has to wash them every night. They would be so gross. Hey Nott, do you think we're going to go by your hometown when we're driving up here? Oh really? So you're nomadic. Do you have little huts you put up as camping tents? Did you like that? I don't know, I've never tried it! Is that why you left? I saw you. No. I could tell you, but I feel like it's offensive or something. Well, my mom used to tell me that if you act up too much, the goblins will come in the middle of the night and steal you away. Yeah. And would you eat? Because my mom said you would eat them! Did you ever eat a little child, Nott? Do you even know who your brothers and sisters are? Oh. That sounds a little shitty, Fjord. Like what? Maybe we do. Everyone likes bacon. Bacon is super good. Yeah! She doesn't want to hurt her baby, Caleb! Is it into the woods or is it further along? It's a small shack. Should we go knock on the door? No, we'll just keep going. The shack is a mile away. Can Frumpkin be a bird? Not for me, though. Caleb hates me. I want people to like me. You're checking out the shack? Did you kill someone for that? Great! Maybe we should just live here instead of going anywhere else. Let's keep going. Don't fuck this up, Fjord. Have you ever tried human before? I'm going to start making a nice, pretty bed in the cart. It's going to be really nice looking. For anyone who wants to stay in here with me. Then I'm going to crumple them up! Never mind. What? Or a sleep arrow. At least we got a surprise attack. That's good. Oh my god, they're huge! Wolves? Goblins? Oh shit balls. You don't want to curse it, right. I was expecting another six. They are goblins! As I'm lifting my shield, the other one gets underneath it. Oh no! Natural 20! Did I take damage from that one arrow? 16 hits the goblin? He has 40 movement? (screaming) Caleb! If I fucking waste one of my fucking spells... Caleb! I rush over and I cast Cure Wounds at 2nd-level to heal Caleb. That would be 2d8 plus four. Oh, that's 12 plus eight, so 20 points of healing. (crying) It's not working! I don't know what's going on! I'm going to use my bonus action-- I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Sacred Flame at the ogre that is attacking us. Oh, it is. I'm sorry, I was thinking, because it's a cantrip-- you're right. Bonus action. There's not really anything I can do, is there? (tearily) I'm going to try to drag Caleb away from the fire, behind Yasha. Great. Caleb, fucking me again! Natural 20? How much? Eight and nine? That's 17. Wait, no, I think-- did I? No, I did that wrong, didn't I? Shit balls. Anyway, strength saving throws? I got to close out of that. Okay, strength. 12 and 13. I'm going to cast Hellish Rebuke in response to one of the-- That would be 15 points of damage to him. You stay away, you piece of--! It's okay. You're still really cool looking, though! That's what poison does? You get disadvantage on all your attacks if you're poisoned? That sucks. You're alive! How did-- Whoa, we need to get you some AC. I saw one that was good and I was like Oh, no. Okay, I'm going to cast Sacred Flame at the wolf in front of me. It's dex. Sacred Flame. Does not succeed. 2d8. Oh, five damage to him. Dang it. Then I'm going to cast, for my bonus action, Spiritual Weapon! Here. Oh, you have one? I want it right in front of me because I might as well have it crash down on the wolf as well! Okay. That is 16. That is a d8 plus four, that's nine points of damage to the wolf. Damn it! Yeah, because I can't move; he'll attack me. But he's going to attack me anyway! He could attack Caleb, though. He'll probably attack me. I'm going to stay right there. Oh no! It happens. Oh, it's magnets? Ha! Hit under his arm! Hit his ribs like you did with me! Hit his ribs! Hey! Yeah, 17. (Texan accent) Drink of water? Yeah, Molly! Are you an angel? At home, you mean? You were the only one of your family that had it? (gasp) Have you tried? Okay. What did you say? Do you want us to leave the table? Her face looks angry. Just all of us staring at you. I pull down my Spiritual Weapon and start licking it. Only the parts that hit the wolf and the ogre. Hello! Xhorhas? Xhorhasian, I think? He's a spy. Are they wearing underwear? (horrified yelling) I'm going to draw that in my journal. Oh my gods, can you imagine what would have happened if they were all over us when we woke up? Did you hang out with ogres, too? Nott, are you okay? Was it weird to fight other goblins? Oh. You liked it? What?! Oh, you were Nott a torturer. What happened to him? Did you leave before he did? (whispers) Really?! Did you love him? What was the distraction? That's good. Wow. But your goblin friends knew where the village was. Why? But you helped him! What if we cast Disguise Person on you, and you could find out if he was okay? What if after we do this, we go down there and see? We just killed two ogres and some wolves, and a bunch of other goblins. We could probably do some serious damage to your old, mean tribe. Just because you look like them, doesn't mean that you have to be like them. There's that creepy smile again, Beau. Maybe there is a comma. TRAVIS and Maybe not, though. Maybe some of them are nice like you. In your tribe. Have you gone to other tribes? Maybe you were just in a really shitty tribe. I don't know if we will all fit. I'm okay in the rain. I am! I need to sleep. I got injured. I'm going to sleep. Oh, all right.
