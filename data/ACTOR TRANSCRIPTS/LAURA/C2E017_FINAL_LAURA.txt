It was great. Gail! Gail! This says, "Sew a quilt of fabric swatches, not fabric crotches!" Not so fast, young lady. I found my tuna casserole in the garbage. Gail, your friend from school was just in a car accident. She was drunk driving. Gail, why didn't you do your report on First Ladies? Gail! Keyleth's was adorable! That had been released already? I am definitely going to be playing that game, like right after the baby's born. Is it like tuna in here? What's in here? Is there tuna in here? I think there is. I'm not supposed to have tuna! (laughter) Well struck, my lord! (gasps) It's a celebration! Yes. Can you hear the difference? Is it the morning? I'm going to spend a minute focusing on the mote and get a point! Did you know that we have a special weapon now? This thing, you can get this mote of possibility. Basically, you get to affect time. I'm not exactly sure how it works, but it's really cool. I feel really powerful and stuff, inside. Like five percent. Okay. I'll punch her. Oh jeez, I dropped it. That doesn't count. I don't punch her very hard. I'm going to pull my punch, because I only rolled a five. Oh, I hit her? Yes! Okay, so now I roll for damage? Four damage! Rawr! Do you have dead arm? Wait, if I punch you in your ass you'll get dead leg. Have you ever tried it? Yeah, I punch her in her butt and try to give her dead leg. Oh man, come on! What do I add to it? This is shit. Oh plus the proficiency. No, it's still not enough. It's like nine. Nein! I wasn't trying to hit you anyway. I didn't want to hit you. Anyway, I have this thing, and I could've used it then to really hit you but I'm not going to. I'm going to save it for something really powerful. Are you in the room, Yasha? Did I say something like that? He had said that this thing would help them with having babies, yeah. I would assume if we have it then he won't be able to have babies. Probably. That's really smart, Beau. Where was it happening? It was along the border, huh? In Nogvurot? Yeah, that's where it was happening. I know. Nogvurot is along the border. (laughter) Northward. I brought it back in, didn't I? I didn't read it! I'm pulling my map out now. Oh, that's not at all where I thought it was. I thought it was over by the Ashguard Garrison, but it's not. Yeah, weird. Maybe it's not connected, then. Unless there are a lot of them, the bad guys, in Nogvurot, which we could check out. I wonder how. I wonder if there's an underground passage that people aren't seeing or something. Or maybe they can go invisible. Or maybe they have an airship! Or maybe they can turn into mist, and fly through the air where people can't see them. I've heard of people doing that. Fjord! Come in! Fjord! There's a celebration going outside! Yes! I run outside. The close of the harvest. About what? The chest area? I'm sorry. Don't talk about titties! (whispering) I wonder if that's the new owner. Past the tatas. Was it a dead human or a dead tiefling or a dead-- It could've been an elf. Why would you say that? There's a skeleton in the basement, apparently. Could you still eat the body? If you can't eat the body anymore then it's not a person. I chase after them too. I know! All by yourself, Caleb? I want to get thrown in a trebuchet. Okay. Does it seem like there are more guards around than usual? Are the guards relaxed? Like a wonder child! Do we need to pick them up and do the thing like you did with the child? You hit a mother. You should have let me and Yasha pick you up. (gasps) Okay. Yasha, you get on one side. I'll get on the other. Oh, no. We're going to pick Fjord up the way that you did the little child. You need to put that shit in jail. We throw Fjord. Molly! Yay Molly! Does he get a prize? Really? Okay! No! Oh, no! I rolled two twos. Did it mess up my jewelry? Thank you. Go Yasha! It changes in the air. That's it? A strawberry? (gasps) Caleb and Nott are already there. Oh, the one where they spin it around and you see which cup it is. I want to find the candied apples. Yasha! ASHLEY and We get a candied apple, okay? Yeah. Five silver. ASHLEY What's the prize? Yeah! Yes, yes, yes! Nice. TRAVIS and Yasha can go first. I'm going to wait to give him my money because I have a feeling Yasha might win. I'm going to wait. What are we trying to do here? Ooh! Yasha! That will buy us so many candied apples. Oh, well all right. Five gold is-- all right. What!? You guys. You're going to play, right? What? I roll for strength check? Natural 20! (cheering) Seven gold. Thanks, Nott. It worked. I skip away. You have to try them. They're so good! Well, the candied apples are hard, right? The caramel apples are softer. Do you have caramel apples? Yes. That's what I wanted! I'm going to buy one for all of us. Okay. How much does that add up to in silver? Okay. I pass it over. An hour! You have to wait because we got all of them! (laughter) Aw. I cut a little slice off and give her one little slice. Where's your mama? Do you have a mama? Is she around? Oh no, I was going to give you more, but okay. Goodbye. No. Where in relation to all of this is the Hearth of the Allhammer? Because I know it's in the Pentamarket. You could do it! Get the doll. I bet it's cursed! You could have got your own prize! You shouldn't use wire to do that, Caleb. He's going with the dice jail dice! You should not have done that. She won't need six more shots. Two swords! Double rats! We'll find some other dinner, Yasha. That's a really good doll. Or caramel them! Can I start to wander away towards the Allhammer? Is there a statue of the Allfather? The Allhammer guy? Is there any guards around or are they mostly gone because of the celebration? I go inside. No. I'm going to casually walk in. Just, you know. Thank you. Oh, I should have disguised myself first. I leave. Go literally right around the corner and disguise myself, and I come right back in. I cast Disguise Self as an old woman-- oof, who just burped? No, it wasn't me. With like a really tight bun and little teeny glasses and a cane. I guess I can't make myself have a cane, can I? All right, well I walk kind of hunched over. (grumbling) Is there anybody in there? Nobody's in there? (whispered) Oh, shit. Okay. I'm going to walk around to the back end of the anvil and act like I'm praying, but I'm going to wait until it looks like they're all looking the other direction. I would like to get my paint set out and paint pink hearts all over the back side of the anvil along with "The Traveler was here". Then I'm going to leave a couple travel brochures for the Traveler. Yeah, I think that's good but they're sizeable hearts. I want nice pretty pink, all over the hammer. The anvil. Okay. With a pink dice. That's pretty good. 18. Oh, and I'm going to take some sequins off of my sequins glove and sprinkle it on there. I want one sitting right on top of the anvil. Then I'm going to leave. 11. (quavering) Oh, no, just leaving a little message for my son here. He's a big worshipper. Ah. I walk away. I walk really quickly. Drop disguise. Well, no, I zoom around the corner. I take a bite of my caramel apple, and I go walking down. (gasp) I lick the spot. (groaning) What's going on? Beau lost at arm wrestling? Go Gunther! You're very big and strong, Fjord! Mm-hmm. You had a candied apple. You should be fine. Do it, Yasha! (yelling) Use your feminine wiles! (yelling) Her hair's so beautiful. Woo! With advantage! Finish him! (chanting) Yasha! Yasha! Advantage! One of them is going to have exhaustion soon, I know it! (yelling) No! No! No! Rip his arm off, Yasha! Don't shoot him! Did she win anything? Did she get a prize? (yelling) Lame! I bet yours says, "Please don't ever contact us again." A gold a day, that's pretty good. Right? Is it? I mean, we've been making a good amount. No, that's not what I was going for, I wanted to know what he looks like. (gasps) The Victory Pit! The Mighty Nein. Just kidding. Wait, I heard you say you were from Nogvurot, yes? Did you notice any of the kids that were missing up there? Oh! We're really good at keeping secrets! Well, let's general charisma check-- oh, that would be a natural one there. Is that what you're being paid for up there? Wow. How many people are in your group? Whoa. What kind of techniques, just in case, you know, we have to fight you? We have to go sign up for this. We need to get coins. Where did you get those coins? You have a blacksmith in the thing?! We need to go sign up for the tournament. You too, Darrow! Why a nine though? I thought the nine meant that-- I'm going to start practicing making a cool logo for us in my sketchbook. Got some new specs there. Do you need those and we never knew? Your glasses fell off when you were bent over. Yeah, let's sign up! What a festival! Aren't those the same kind-- Should we go in, then? Yes? Is this where we go if we're going to fight? How do we be one of the fights? Oh no, we're real good! You definitely want us to be in this. We put on a real good show! I don't know. I wonder how experienced these fighters are? Do you think it's stupid that we're signing up for it without knowing much? A cook-off, that is true. It could be. Fjord, you're really good at making chili. Yes yes yes! All over. Everywhere and nowhere. Yes. That's good. We are from lots of places, after all. We'll have to leave one of our members-- Are there rules or are we just allowed to use whatever we come into the tournament with? Only three schmeasly other groups? Fancypants. 20 gold. There you are. What happens if somebody in one of the other groups dies or something when fighting the creatures? Good to know. For the other groups, yes. Cat butt right in their face. I guess I'm going to do some jumping jacks to prepare for this. I would much prefer if it was actually a leather thong that you had to put on in order to get the Mage Armor. How do we prepare for this, Fjord? I don't think we can. Oh yes (jibberish). That's not noticeable at all. Oh no! Well, take it off. Oh! That's the garrison over by the-- On our side or their side? I mean, who cares, right? Good thing we didn't join the army, huh? Oh no! Maybe if you competed and they saw you were awesome, they're going to tell you you have to join. All of us, or just you and Nott? (whispers) He's got a crush on you, I can tell. We have a little box traveling with us. There will be a very unhappy day tomorrow. I hope we don't have to fight him. Nine. Oh. He was supposed to go. Right? 16. Me. Is he in white? Is that the color of robes he-- Whoa. Do we all fight the same type of creature? That's us! Oh my god! Oh no! Oh my god, that's so cool. Yeah, where did the monster come out of? Oh, okay. Can you help me? I want to be there. Oh, right. There's multiple doors. It's a big eating-poop pile! Yeah, gag me with a spoon, Mrs. Henderson! That's what she does! Fists of fury, Mrs. Henderson! They're like balsa wood. I start laughing. Oh, let's see what it weirdly does. It's going to poop on you! Ew! It's like Charlie! How much damage did he do? 15 fucking points! Oh no, you're poisoned! Whoa, that's good. Okay, well he's right there, so I'm going to use Sacred Flame on him. Oh, actually I'm really close and he's already been hurt. I'm going to Toll the Dead on him. That is a wisdom saving throw! I get to hit him! Seven points of damage! I want to back away! Did he already use his reaction at all? Oh no. No, fuck it, I'm going to stay right there. You get advantage, remember. Okay, sorry. No, not its poop mouth! Oh no! That hits me. I'm going to use Hellish Rebuke on him. Yeah, you still don't have any stupid arms, stupid! Hellish Rebuke is a 2nd-level. I really wish it gave more information about what-- It doesn't say anywhere what Hellish Rebuke-- oh there it is! Dexterity save! That means I get 3d10. 12. How much damage did you say I just took, though? Because I was busy. 19 points of damage. If you feel like attacking. Oh, that's me! Yeah, I think so. What do you add to it? It's 18. It landed in my box, but it landed up. Oh god. Does it look like it's hurting at all? While I'm in its grasp, can I touch the tentacle and cast Toll the Dead again? I want to do that. Okay. Two. I probably should have tried to un-restrain myself. It's an action. Well, I already did it. I already Tolled the Dead, so too late. I guess so. There could be. 17 times two is 34. That was amazing. I'm going to cast Thaumaturgy and start whispers throughout the crowd going (chanting) Yasha, Yasha! Hopefully the crowd picks it up. Yes. I've got one kit left so I'm going to use my medicinal herbs on you, Beau, to get rid of the poison. I'm very low, hit point-wise. I'm at 12 out of 31. Huh? Oh, I can use my spells to heal us right now. The only thing I have that can get rid of poisoning is Lesser Restoration, which I can cast on Yasha right now. I can get rid of the poison on you. It's probably-- No, it's not an herbalism kit, it's medicinal herbs, which you specifically told me it removes poison on action. Oh, okay. Oh no. I'm proficient-- oh, that's good. Yeah, it's a 23. Yeah, I'll do it. I'm at 12 hit points. Yasha, you need healing too! Are you sure? It's what? How many d4? 2d4? Good luck! I'm going to take a healing potion. That was intense. Would we be able to have fought those two minotaurs? MARISHA and Is it possible to climb up on one of the walls? I'm going to try and climb up on top of the wall. That's really good. This one, sure. Why not. Yeah. It's a 22. Beau, ten points. I Invoke Duplicity in the middle of the-- next to Nott. Yeah, next to Nott. 22. Six again, Fjord? I'm going to cast Sacred Flame at the one behind me! That's a dex save. Yes! Five points of damage to him! I'm going to make my Invoked Duplicity Jester run right in the middle of the two walls, past Fjord. Yeah, and she's going to start going (gibberish). Even though I am high up? 20. Already? Eight points to me? Halved because I'm resistant to cold damage. Roll high. Oh no. 26 points? Are you raging? Oh no! No, attack the one that's by all of us! Having seen Beau do that just then and it looked really cool, I'm going to jump off the wall with my handaxe in my hand and try to come down onto the back of the one right there. That is a 17 to hit! Nine points of damage! Can I back up? Is it going to get an attack of opportunity? Oh no! Well, I'm going to move around him. I'm going to move to his tail. To the pillar, yeah. How you want to do this! I pet him and say Good doggy. It is definitely sneak attack. Everyone's up. Both me and my invoked Jester go Ooh. It was so slow-- Maybe the dice gods really want the charity to do well. I'm going to Toll the Dead. My invoked Jester is going to run around and stand next to Fjord. 14. No toll or anything. I think that's basically all I can do, though. The minute that it ends I'm going to start casting Prayer of Healing. Yeah. Who all is injured right now? One, two, three, four. You're not and you're not at all? Okay, so I'm going to cast it on the five of us. Yeah. Oh yeah, that's what I'm asking. I can do six people. That's decent. 14 points to everyone. I need to learn that. I was hoping they would lose. Well we attack and then run to the middle. We might get a surprise attack on them. Let's do it. Invoke Duplicity I think lasts for-- I want to say an hour but I don't know if it does. I'm going to go, with me and you Molly on the other door. Okay, I'm going to hop up-- I'm going to do the same thing and hop up on a wall like last time. I'm going to hold my attack for the door that-- I want to be on the other one. You're too close. No, there was just Fjord. Yeah, he moved. Oh, god.
