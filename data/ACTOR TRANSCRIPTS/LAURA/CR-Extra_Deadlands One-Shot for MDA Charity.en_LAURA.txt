(drawling) Well, all right. Or do. Donate. Buy him whatever you want. Why do you get to-- If you donate $500, Matt will say "high noon" whenever you want. (laughs) I'm sorry. I'm so nervous! Oh, hi there. My name's Juniper Langley, but if you call me that I just might shoot you in the mouth. Everyone knows me calls me Stinky Jules. That on account of the fact that I don't like to bathe. My mother was an escort, but I always preferred shooting men to fucking them, so I decided to pick up a gun and fight my way through life. You've got a pretty mouth, Rev. Potentially. I could watch my mouth. Sorry about that cussing earlier. Oh wait, so we don't get to choose? All right. I might get all blue. Where's the bowl?! I don't care! Aw. Two blacks and a red. Are there not as many blue ones as there are-- Oh, well, that makes sense. Do we get to know what you got? Damn it! Where's that deck?! That deck. (laughs) Shut up. Oh no, what'd I get? Oh, shit. That's right. I like to take good care of my weapons. Oh, jeez. That was fun. Sydney-- I think you sinned. What's a joker card? A black poker chip? Oh, damn it! Lean your shit out the window. Yeah, that's what they do here. I'm going to go get some whisky. Shit, I want to watch the game. Drink, and then watch the game, because I really want to see the game. Fast, fast. Give me some whiskey. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, shit! I can't catch! What's the other guy look like? He's bluffing. That one's bluffing. DONATION That's right! He's a fucking cheater, I can tell! Look up his sleeves! That one's cheating. I jump in the fight. Yeah, I punched him. Oh, shit! I'm going for the one that was cheating! Whoa, she got two of them? Okay. What is that? Oh, shit. Two. Fuck. Whose shoulder is it on? Is it on his or on hers? Hey, Sue? What's your problem? I think that shit I gave her last night is fucking her up. That's a shoulder, hon. So he was cheating. We weren't just saying that so we could punch him? Was he wearing all them fancy clothes when he got to town? Sounds like a shit. Where's your place? You got a picture on the outside of that place there? What's it look like? Oh, shit, really? Why, why? Be nice to him so he'll help us. All right, he got all his-- Yes! (growls) Thanks, friends. All right! This is a good day. I'm with you, son. Oh shit, I can't catch for shit. Hey, Rev! I could use some succor and aid. I just like the challenge of it. Someday. Wait, wait, wait! You make money off of cards, and it's not gambling? Shh. It's a fancy guy. If you want her to read your fortune, I can do that too. I'm real good at it! I charge less than she does, but I do it even better! All right, sure. Sheriff? So what you're need is some kind of, like, guns or something for hire? All right. Is this that damn creature that's been tearing people up? Maybe its mama is looking for him, tearing people up to get to him. That's my-- --investigational deduction. That's right. I got a three there. Smarts. No. (laughter) Hmm, it's a small bear. (gasps) I caught it! Oh shit. What the fuck is this thing doing?! All right, all right. I guess I pet it. I mean, if it wants to be with me, I ain't going to stop it, you know, but-- I can't give you anything but scraps, so you better get used to that. You and me, kid. Do I get to keep the bear, though? (gasps) Oh, he's a real guy! Already? What the? MARISHA and (laughs) It feels so good out here! But before I go, I want to get some whisky in a to-go cup. That's my jug. That's right. That's right. And I go find the doc. Oh shit. What if we don't have that ability? You have street ones? Oh, that's true. Reroll that shit! We need to find the doc! Hey there. I know. People getting hit, getting attacked right? Shit like that? We don't got no patients for you. Shit. Pay attention! I don't smell anything. Piles of viscera. Gross. That's foul. I go over and give him some whisky. The feverish fella. Have some whisky. Make you feel better. All right, that's enough! While he's doing that, can I poke around them piles of bodies and see-- Is that, like, notice? DONATION Does it take guts to look? Oh, what do I roll? Like a d6. I get to roll again, 'cause it's six? Oh, 11, there. While I'm poking through them bodies. What? Like a special note just for him? Just for no purpose. Like somebody wanting us to find them. So you think that whatever did this could actually be staying inside of this town? Don't be stingy. Hold on, I'm about to drink. Wait, zero, but I'm going to add a red chip, so I can get some of that. So five. Yeah, but here's my chip that I just used to get that. Don't you fucking call me Juniper! I don't know you. Oh, that's true. Did you check your junk? (laughter) I think you already went down it, if you get my meaning. Spirit? It's going to be hard for me to beat, seeing as how I've only got a d6 here. Five. Yeah, all right, I'll add a black chip-- no, no, no, I don't want to reroll it, I've got to add to it, and I'm out of my colors here. All right, I'll add a red. What's that? Nine? Damn it! Fine. I wasted a chip to talk him into giving it to me in the first place. Oh, that tastes like shit! What is this? What were they? Shit. Sounds like it was rich folks getting killed in this town. Who should we talk to to find out what kind of creatures have been living in this city? Oh, is it still following us? Feel free. No one's stopping you. You've gotta be strong when you're raising such a creature, now. So make sure you discipline him, but also give him lots of love and whisky, but no chocolate, I hear that's bad for him. No chocolate. What can I say? He just loves the way I smell. You can try. Trinket. Do you announce when you use a chip? I wonder if this little beast can lead us to another beast? I mean, it is a baby, I don't know. That's true, we could. It is so hard to fight the motherly instinct. I know I'm not, but it's real hard to fight it! That's smart. You're smart! Well, lead the way, Smarts. I step right through the horseshit. Them bodies in the doc's place. They came from you? I mean, but why? They been teared up by a beast or something. Figure out what that is? You seen any beasts around here, outside of this little bear? All right. I go up to the bar and get some drinks going. That's good! That's the eight you reroll. I like the way you sound, Dan! There's plenty around. Was that a blink? (laughter) So you want one of them whores? I pull up the closest whore to me. Hey. Which one of you are the least itchy? (clicks tongue) They're all clean. I don't believe a word she says, but they're all clean. He wants to interview you! I go and ask one of them whores about the guys that are dead. I want to find a whore and ask her about-- (laughs) Ask her about them bodies I found over at Doc's place. Oh, yeah, it's hot, isn't it? Hey, I saw them bodies over at Doc's place. Tored up. Wait, wait, don't-- I just, did you know those dudes? Those guys? And he actually worked here? DONATION All right, that's good to know. What about that other fella? Hugh. He's a fucker, wasn't he? All right, when did they go missing? Where's Mr. Schwerenger? We allowed to go up there? That looks like lock-and-key sort of shit. Talk to Dan? All right. Hey. Thanks for the help, there. Aw, shit. I hand her some money. Oh, don't mind her. She's just a fortune teller. You all right there, Rev? I think he'd pull it there, hon. Hey, hey! Sue, Sue. She's scary as fuck. Hey, Dan. Your employer up at the top of them stairs. How do I get to talk to him? How do I get permission to talk-- No, I want to help you kill the motherfucker that killed your motherfuckers. Now you seem capable. He's done some crazy shit today. Calm down, you guys that are really revved up right now. Down to what? Hey, get your fucking hand off my gun. Don't fucking touch my gun. You're going to reach for my gun when a motherfucker's pointing a gun at you? Add something to it! I know, we've got so many. No, you rerolled, yeah. Also, I'd probably murder you for trying to touch my weapon. Put your hands down. Would I have noticed that he brushed his hand? I don't got a dick. I got a four. Well, I've only got one blue chip, and the other one's a reroll, so I can't get any better. What's that mean? Al? We're here to help. Me and these weirdos that surround me are here to look for the people that have been killing your men. That's right. Be quick about what? Why? Sure. Close the door, Rev. Well, I'm Stinky Jules. Nice to make your acquaintance. Is he faking what? Oh. Yes, we did. Well, I tried to punch him. I almost punched him. But we did in fact see him cheating at poker earlier today. I will certainly try to do that again, sir. Simon. What's wrong with you? Yeah. I don't have any idea what he just said. What the fuck does this have to do with that damn creature killing people? I'm confused. Do you think it was Hurst that killed them? Sure. Where would we start to look for any of the shit you just talked about? He has information. Cy? Simon? All right. We will do that. Kind of wanted to go out the balcony. How'd she lose her teeth, then? Can't blame her for that! I mean. Lots of people are drinking in this bar. Accidents happen. Get the fuck out! Let's go. Why are you petting air? It's better if you're itching to actually touch your body. I've found it has a better effect. I poke at it. I push it out. Okay. Yeah, that looks pretty. Sure, take some whisky there. Just a four minus two. You want some more of this action, Rev? Oh, yeah, we had sex. Well, you had a lot of sex with the Sue girl, a little bit of sex with brains over there. Is that not all right with you, Rev? You were real, real, real into it, I just want to let you know. You were having a lot of fun. I even, at one point, asked if you wanted to stop, because it seemed a little bit obscene even to me, but you kept on go-- I do. Here, have some. Did you really just drink my whisky? Yes, you did. Shit! I take off running. Oh, shit! I pull out my gun and look around for whatever it was that was just attacking him. Notice, notice. Damn it. I'm going to-- wait. Damn it! All right, I'm going to spend a blue. It's because he just drank all that whisky. Going straight through him. Simon! I walk up and I punch him. (laughter) I got a five. Strength is-- oh, it's just four. Two. Oh, I want to reroll. I fought him, I got-- The attack. Four! And add one to it, so five. I pick up the tooth, and I put it in my pocket. And I tell everybody, everybody saw that! If anybody asks, I did in fact punch that man. Oh, because I was asked to by Mr. Salinger. Schewerenger. I just walk away from him and start asking people if anybody saw who attacked that other feller. No, the black is the reroll. That's just fucking crazy. I agree with that statement. And tell us who it was that attacked you. But you're not dead! We should go check out that bear-walking-dog-bear beastly sort of creature and kill it. Again, aim for the actual part that itches. It helps, I swear. Seven plus four is 11. All right, let me check it out. Maybe we should pour some more whisky on that. Just push on the wound. Well, shit. We should get that doc out here and take care of them wounds again. In the meantime, maybe we should all go find that bear. The bear ran out into the woods. It's right that way. We start following him. I push Sydney in front of me, and I say, maybe you should follow behind the reverend there, Sydney. Oh man! Why do you keep calling them Vox Monica? What the fuck is lycanthropy? What did you eat, son? Yeah! All right! No! But no, with the red-- Do the blue, do the blue. What the fuck is that word you're saying? Like. There's a, wait. What are we talking about werewolves? I thought it was a bear? Oh! I understand. Oh. So we got a big old wolf trying to quarantine off-- Should we keep looking for a wolf then, or should we talk to these people in town that you think might be a wolf? I'll try. But I don't got a thing. Oh, I did it wrong. And if you get the top, you get to roll again? 16. 14. That was. I wondered what you were going to call me there! Uh... a bunch of things have been boarded up. Can we take them down and go in the place? Why don't you lead the way, there, Syd? Yeah, you look like you're capable. Yeah. All right. Ooh. Right. Should we look inside the mine? Do we see tracks of a beast around? What about this little bear cub that we got with us. Does he smell anything around? Tell you what, he's useless, but he sure is damn cute. All right. I go and look inside the mine. Yeah, pull back some of that wood. Do we got any sort of-- I've got some matches. Oh! Hey, who's got a lantern? All right. I'm holding my hand above my pistol. Looks like somebody's trying to-- Watch them feathers. Somebody's trying to keep people from getting this silver. What? We should get some of that silver though. DONATION Well, I see some silver's left behind. And I try to get some. I don't want to cart around that much. I'm going to take about a pound of it. Stick it in my shirt. All right. What's wrong with your damn wrist? All right, give it to me. I'll take a look at it again. I'll just keep on pushing. Something's weird with this guy. And then minus two. Yeah, you also roll a d6. Do you want to hold some of that silver? Oh shit. Well, I did, but it's usually silent. What the fuck is that? I bet that thing's in here! Let's go kill it! I want to go kill it. Yeah! Let's go. I'm holding up silver and I got my hand on my pistol. Ugh, I shoot it! Yeah! What do I roll for this? What's R.O.F? Is that what I roll-- a six? Do I roll a d6? Okay. I'm going to re-roll. Oh shit! Awesome. Okay. All right. It was uh-- oh, a d6. I didn't-- So that was a nine total. The lower of the two is a four. So it adds to eight. Yeah. Yes. Damn it! Well, that's good. Hand it over. I'm pushing the bear off my leg. Oh jeez. Okay. You're going to shuffle it? Wow. Did you pull a card? Oh Jesus, really?! Do you see what just happened, with the three of these? Guts roll. Oh, jeez. Man, come on. I'm rerolling, just in case. Oh, sorry, I should warn you. All right, all right, I'm going to add one too. I'm going to use my blue and add it. Eight. Five. Five. All right, I will! Ooh, yes. Nine. That's a reroll. All right. I want to shoot it a whole bunch of times. I'm going to fan my hammer. Yeah, let's do it. I have no idea how that-- Okay, so that's just a six? Or wait, I'm going to reroll the third one. So I got eight on the first two, so that's six for the first two, and then I'm going to reroll the third. That's five on the third hit. I'm rerolling this one. Four on the fourth. Six on the fifth. Rerolling on the sixth one. Sorry. Oh shit, off the table. And six on the last one. Oh my gosh. So did I hit every single time? Six plus one is seven for the first. Seven for the second. Ooh! (gasps) 19. Oh my gosh. 24 on the next. What the fuck was that thing? What's up, Lucas? How close are we? I used so many of my chips on that one! OFF- Oh, $67,000. I'm going to reload my gun while we're leaving the place. A large cougar? Should we shoot it? Okay, all right. Find the fucking entity. We should kill it. We should kill it while we're on the hunt, I mean, we're ahead of it. Right, but we can find-- what? Can I walk up to him and just punch him in the gut? What the fuck are you? What's going on with you? Are you the monster we're looking for? I take out the silver and I push it on this face. I take it and I push it on his hand. Good job, guys! Awesome! I'm going to choose the one second to the left. Oh, he's shuffling, I saw the king. Did we get a straight? What'd you get? Aw, so close. Thanks, guys! What? Why the fuck? Did Trinket humping me make me not get to go? Hah! I want to shoot it. I'm going to shoot the werewolf bear creature. All right. I do. I'm going to fan my hammer again, man. I'm going to reroll the first one. That's seven. Oh, so three on the first hit, which probably doesn't hit. Ooh, that's good. So eight, eight, nine on the next ones. Nine on the one after that, so I've got one more. Nine-- no, that's a six, damn it. Okay. All right. 12 plus five is 17, plus five, actually. 17 plus five is 22 on the first one. 11 on the second one. 11 on the third. 18 on the next one. Oh my god. 15, no, 17 on the next one. Do I get one more hit? Eight on the last one. Oh my god. I'm going to reload. I'm going to back away from it, too. Damn, Marisha. Wait, we don't get to finish the game? Oh shit. Is there anything to duck behind? Probably should've done that. I think you suffer two wounds. Yeah, she went ten over. Five. Five. What about Trinket? Is he alive? Humping? We didn't have time for it. Man. That was a fun game. What did we get to? OFF- You guys are amazing. Thanks for all the chips. I know, right? Eventually, yeah. My throat hurts from talking like Stinky Jules the whole time. All right!
