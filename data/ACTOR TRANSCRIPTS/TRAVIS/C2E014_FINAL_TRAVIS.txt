When I drink to you, Ashley, my heart is as full as my glass. It's totally not toxic. 826LA! Yes it is. First time ever. I'm not moving it. I'm not touching it. (laughter) (shouting) Fucking insight check on Taliesin! No, I'm kidding. If we had to ballpark it, how many persons would you say are in this? I don't mind rolling with this name Lucien, but does it bring any extra trouble with it? Fair enough. All right. Not a chance. I didn't catch that at all. Lucien Nonagon. Wow. This is all well and good and kind of fucking boring. I couldn't help but notice that surly-looking crew up there, who might that be? Humbly, we are members of The Mighty Nein. Well, we sought an audience, and to be frank, we thought we might find a little bit more of a warm reception than the one that we're currently getting. Oh of course, easily understood. We mean to make ourselves of service, whether it be for the good of the city or other endeavors. We're new here. We thought we would try to make as many introductions and have as many meetings happen as we could. Oh, I'm sure we'd be all ears. Oh, of course, and forgive my ignorance. This would be used to locate us? Is that what this is for? Yeah, fuck it. How did you do that? Right. (laughs) Don't like it, do you? Yeah. Three to go? One, two, three? Yes, I'd say I am. Are you writing that down? Shit. Where's the fucking luck of Jester? I could as well. All right. I feel lucky. Deal. Fjord. No. Now I do. Ooh, get 'em! My goodness, this is getting expensive quite fast. (yawning) 50 gold. Mm-hmm. You first. Funny how that works. No, I'm good where I am. Sounds good. 50 it is. What, we're not going to bet again? (silence) Let's make it 150. (mutters) That's all the money I have. (counting) So 500. I can do math. A seven, a five, and a three. (cheering) Thank you. Nice hand. Very versatile I'd have to say though. Balanced. The goliath. Nott, I think-- Yeah. This is most intriguing. I hope we would be able to interview your previous compatriots. We'd like to know what they saw before, what we might expect. To clear our name here in Zadash? You're going to kill The Gentleman. Sir, I couldn't help but hear that this is about a mile outside of the city. Is that correct? Are you operating on any sort of a timeline? Might we have a little bit of lenience with how quickly we get this dealt with? I've just had a thought, actually, if you could help us at the same time, we're trying to get a friend of ours out of the city. And (coughs) recent events seem to have clogged up most entries and exits. We have a friend, Horris, that needs to find his way to a safe spot. Indeed. Discretion is appreciated. Figured you might. Outstanding. I think we have a deal, do we not? Outstanding. Fantastic! Nott, pace yourself now, you hear? Is that goliath wielding any sort of visible weapon? Ogre and the goliath mauls each. Fuck. Oh yeah, they were armored behind us? That group looks like your type. Feel like making friends? I would love to. What do you expect to see there, T? Yeah, I was going to say the same thing. Let me get this straight. A bunch of fucking floating lights came out of the wall, gave your boy a little static shock, and you ran? Yeah. Well, they're calling in the big leaguers now, so we'll take it from here. Your way up and down those stairs you mentioned, you get tripped up along the way, or was it just easy sailing? What about it was ominous? Yeah. Scared of school. Yeah. Old terrors. I appreciate your passion. I don't think you're in great favor in this room, at the moment. You see that really tall woman over there with that big greatsword on her back? She doesn't appreciate when people talk to us like that. 13. No, 15. Sorry. My shag armor. Did you three have a name? Don't be ashamed if you don't. Don't worry. We'll clean it up for you. Enjoy your drinks. Going to join the others. Deception check? Of course. Yeah. Good thing I won, huh? Am I rolling in it? Oh. No, I was actually only gambling my funds. Yeah. Are you? At the moment. I'm telling the truth. I hadn't even divvied up that amount from Dolan and everybody else. Good to know. Calculated risks. I'll keep that in mind. I thought you liked to play things close to the chest. Sometimes you got to get a little stupid, though. No, that's not it either. Can you change that alcohol into wine? It's alcohol one way or the other. I'll fucking drink. Molly-- Excuse me, Lucien. How many others around here might we expect to have that same reaction towards you? Yeah! TRAVIS and You're not afraid of inclement weather or anything, are you? It'd been real fair, that storm rolled in, and poof, you were fucking gone. Did you handle what you needed to handle? I make sure Nott's drink is full all the time. (laughter) I think Kara's the way to go. We start asking him questions about something that big, maybe he won't like us poking our nose around. When shit happened. No. There was a bit of a beatdown the other night in the Tri-Spire. One of the towers was attacked. Oh, Yasha-ing. You want to go talk to Kara before we get out of here? They came in trying to steal this Beacon, this glowing beacon, which we still have, but they were mighty upset about it. Why, Lucien? You afraid the Myriad will hear? What's his reaction? Do I believe him? Shit. 11. What's that saying? Be careful of the toes you step on, they might belong to the ass you got to kiss later? The attack on the tower. I was looking at you. Still need a whisper corner. I'm going to ask you a question you're probably not going to give me the truth to. Is your relationship with the Gentleman one of a debt or one of convenience? I hear that. I only have one other thing. I was taken by Dolan's passionate message. All right. Is some of the business that we can expect going to go against the fair people of this city? Indeed. That's a connection worth the trouble. "You got a nice face"? I'm glad you found a place here. It was good to see you again. If I can't tell, you didn't-- Leave that one alone. We head downstairs. Oh yeah, the one that we had for-- Yeah. Yeah. Like sprinkles and hard candies. Just (dry puffing). (farting) Her skirt's like, (farting). (singing) I'm on the couch tonight! (laughter) It's wafting over. Lucien-- Greatsword. Yeah, I think it's got some potential. Do you mind if I hold on to it for a bit? Nott, why don't you ask that big ogre by the door what her name is? You have such a way with people. Yeah, you knock down the barriers, you get right in. Icebreaker. No, that's not true at all. Always good to make friends with the doorman. You got to know this. Tell him that joke you know. Character choice! Come on. Oh no. Kutha. What is it? (laughter) We should go. We go up the stairs and out. Kuthag? Or Kuth-- And we have an amazing community member and Critter who has graciously offered to match all donations up to $40,000. That means each dollar that you donate will be doubled. They're getting worse. I feel like I should divvy up that gold that I didn't hand out earlier. Yeah, I'll have to remember-- I'll have to remember to do that some other day. Oh, right. Does Jester have that? I guess we should let Horris know that he'll get an escort out of town, right? Let's do it. Yeah, right? It went well. I think we found suitable passage for you out of this city. Needless to say, without involving you too much, we're going to have someone take you out a secret entrance and make sure you're safe on your way out. Yeah, I guess it was. I didn't write down how much fucking gold, didn't I? 620. Any favorite parts? Hate those. Pictures good? What the fuck are you reading it for, then? Yeah, sorry. Listen, everybody gets 104 gold. Yep, and three silver. No, not you. Three silver. So did we all. Cereal for dinner. Well. I assume they'll come for you, sometime in the night or in the morning. Hope you won't mind if we don't wait. We traded your expedited journey out of the city in order for us to go and take care of some bit of business for them. We didn't really ask, did we? Oh. No, I think that's probably right. Either that or they'll kill him. (fake laugh) True. Maybe just before we go in. Anything we want to do before we go out on this errand? Yeah, they're booby-trapped. Sounds like a retirement home. The Shady Pear. (laughter) Is your real name Peter? Undetermined percentage is still-- No, don't stop. Just keep going. What, to tell us what you're about to tell us? For us, or for you? Well, one's us and one's you. They're all the same note because they're all fucking empty. (intones melody) Oh no, that wouldn't work. I noticed that she kind of had the same influence over the blood that you have, but different. Buried in the ground? In a box? In the dirt? Charisma saving throw? 22. So before you woke up in the dirt, nothing? Two years ago, did you have all those tattoos? Sure. Why did she seem like she looked up to you so much? Molly-- In the years that have gone by-- Has anyone called you any other names besides Molly, Lucien or-- Yeah. Mahna Mahna. No, but did they know you? Did they come up and give you a name? You don't know anything about the ritual she was talking about? In this group? Yeah, that's a hell of a thing. Right. That's actually in the text thread chain. No idea. That's a layered question. Can I ask you, when you're praying over your swords at night, are you actually doing anything? No. So it's you that's special, not your swords. He has to. But you don't remember getting them? They just appeared? You don't have to do every one of these that's she's going to fucking write. That was to Caleb. Is there anything about you that you don't want us to know? I appreciate that. Should we turn in before we head out tomorrow? Yeah, we came out and told you that. We'll turn in. With the sword? Oh. Not yet. How long does it take to attune to something? An hour? Shit, maybe I should have-- Yeah, I want to try to attune to the Wastehunter Blade. Nice. Yeah, you were there. Oh, I need to go as well. Oh, you know who should come? Yasha. Yeah. The Invulnerable Vagrant. You'll like this. Pumat Sol is-- how would you describe? Unique? Mm-hmm. (laughter) Anybody else coming to the Invulnerable Vagrant besides the three of us? Yep, four. The Invulnerable Vagrant. (as Jester) "Don't make me laugh." When I come home all the lights will be off with just a candle and a chair. Do we recognize them? Well, if you wouldn't mind, this is one of our compatriots. This is Yasha. New to your establishment. Oh, actually-- This is our friend Yasha. She's new to your establishment. Yasha, do you have any healing potions? Oh my god, that head shake afterwards. The bail. I'm really glad to hear that friendly discount's getting even friendlier. That really nice cloak you have on the wall. How much is that? I fell face first into some coin recently. I think I'll take that. Fjord. I like it. If you miss with it. We got everything we need. We leave. Unique, huh? Yeah. You're quite the word wizard with the haggling there. I was being honest. You actually got money off. Yeah, nice job. She doesn't like the spotlight. Nein! Did we bring Horris with us? Camp counselor Beau. Incredible. Well, we're dropping him off. Yeah we'll be dropping him off at The Evening Nip. A mile out of town. We'll be blinded. We should go. Okay. Horris, we're going to try and get you out of here. What? I think that can probably wait until we are at The Evening Nip. Yeah, sure he can. We just don't want crownsguard thinking we're walking around a hooded person. Okay. We made it. Now's the time. We're just pushing around a guy with a bag on his head. Hey! Nah, it's cool. (high pitched) His eyes are dilated. We made arrangements with The Gentleman downstairs. Outstanding. We defer to your expertise. Sounds fair. It's all right. Go with them. You'll be fine. I'll stay at the front. Wouldn't mind having some muscle up front. Jester? What? What the fuck?! (laughs) Collapse in the wall. We can take it from here. You'll be able to find your way back, right? I'm not good at joking. These boats look like they'll fit three to four each? Okay. All right. Two boats. Jester's in mine. Yasha, you should go in the second boat. We're going to need muscle in case we need to move fast. Is this a boat with like, two oars? All right. Caleb? You want to do your--? Read my mind. (singing) Yah, yah, yah! The people marathoning right now will be grateful to hear that. I know it's coming. I know stuff is coming.
