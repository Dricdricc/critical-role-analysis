(laughs) Holy shit. He was in Civil War as the guy that gets killed by a cop. I sleep in this. And it's legit. Mine smells like a cast. The nail wraps are limited too. Thank god. It's been so long. Then I take off in my bird form, admiring the arch-ipelago but I have an intelligence of eight and realize it's ark-ipelago. And I head for the treeline. I do? Not shit, apparently. 16. Petri-fried trees or are they scorched? I did. Petri-fried. Entire State Building. (squawks) How do you turn my head? (squawks three times) Actually, instead of that, can we go 100 yards past the tree line and into more of the forest, just to see what's there? I'll land us at the treeline. Just the three of them, right? Oh, he's pulling it back. Just pointing and laughing. Natural 20. Because I have advantage on initiative rolls. My dex is two. (squawks) I look over at Scanlan and I'm like (squawk)? So can I hold my movement until Scanlan moves? So I'll take us both over there is my intention. Can't hold my movement. I'm going to take off and I'm going to go towards them and as high as I can go. I'll actually go ahead and take my action and I'll stop flapping my wings. My intention is to plummet. Yeah, right above it. That'll work. Because don't you guys like, once you break out of your animal form, you change back? You can fall off into the water if-- Which is okay! Yeah. That's a Vestige for you. This is, like, your shit, so let's go. Because he's in its what? Got it. So stay out of that. Works for me. Oh yes. All right, since he killed the big one can I fly down to the one that's right next to Vax with Scanlan on my booty? Yeah. Now, if hopefully I wanted him to lift the form, would I hold my action? Yes! I want to do that. I want to land right next to him, like right behind him. Surprise, bitches! Surprise, gents. Woohoo! I would like to make them reckless attacks. That's a 15. Should I roll the other one right now? Oh no, it's just one attack, right? Natural one. 24. Yeah, make it my bitch. Ugh, math is hard. 16, plus bloodaxe, six, so 22. I'm working it out. The second one, 14, then another six for 20. Necrotic on the last, yeah. No. Did I have a bonus action or did I use it to hit? Oh my god. Honestly, I'm quite often a gaseous creature. That sound! That's a lot of math. Come on, wind killer. Somewhere else in the universe, the balance is no more. Because he got a roll. Thanks, Taliesin. Thanks, Obama. Talk to me, Goose. Ooh, what'd you find? What's that thingy? Pointing to the spyglass. Do you have one of those on your big Bad News? Grog remembers that. (laughter) I take off sullenly towards the trees. I grab his collar. I pull him back. 25. Oh, I do! 35. (yelling) What is your rush? Fine. I start stomping extra loud as I walk. Really make it like little bits of salt and pepper beneath my feet. I'm looking for rabbits. Hey, 17. Six. Question! Is the ground still covered in glass? (whispering) They can't hear any of that stuff when you're that quiet. I'll allow it. (laughter) Yeah. Yeah. Don't flatter yourself. Sorry. (quietly) Do we know what the Vestige that she has does? (quietly) So what can we immobilize her with? (quietly) How about we take a short rest? What about the hamster ball? I can barely hear you. I think she doesn't care about her crew, remember? She's already this far inland-- Wait, Vax. From a one to a ten, would you say she's a... Sweet. Like a headshot? Reginald. Who's on the map right now? Still can't see the third, right? We still can't make out the third figure. Yeah. What? It's a 14. I want to ring the fucking dinner bell. I step on the branch that creaked like I'm angry at it. I'll follow suit and also move slightly to the outside and around their flank. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, that's great. You coming here? What are you apologizing for? Gil, this is on your fucking dice. Natural 20 on the second one. I have danger sense. Natural 20. Wow, fuck. Who took the full smack? Oh my god. Did the goliath-- Where is she? Come on, Gil. Natural 20. 22. I look to the crater in the ground and I go Whoa. And I would like to rage. Can I, in 50 feet, get to-- Regular. Can I get all the way to the guy who's right in front of me on the map along the side of the crater, or is that not enough for 50? I'll just get there. Lovely. I would like to make a reckless attack against him with my two blows. That's 29. Nice. 33. No, I'm sorry. 33 to hit for the second one. 29, with five points of necrotic damage. I'm sorry, 29 includes the five points of necrotic damage. I'm so sorry. Second one. Total of 22, with another five points of necrotic. I say Thanks for the warm-up. And that's my turn. That's where we'll pick it up next week. Yeah, we miss Pike! This is reckless. 29. 20 points, including three points of necrotic. 20 total. Yep, that'll hit. Go for it. Jesus, Fenthras. Fenthras! Yes! That hits. I have danger sense, advantage on dex saving throws, dodge, traps and spells. 26 hits. Oh, sneak attack. Halved to 14. Oh man, we're in it, y'all, we're fucking in it! Shit, man, what a map! I'm so excited! Like a pair of crater breasts coming out of the ground. That's on our level. Rainbows are a motherfucker! Did he say 20? The colors determine the-- Some would call it a "cre-vase." Yeah, she does. Now that I've got two playfellows, we're on the edge of the crevasse, right? Yeah. Can I try to push the goliath into the-- can I go into a frenzied rage as my bonus action? And can I use my first attack to try to shove the goliath into the crevasse? Can I move? Worth it. Yeah. Okay. I thought it was a bonus. Yeah. I thought frenzy was also. Yeah, just one over. That'll hit. For my reckless attack, I'd like to try and push her into the crevasse. Nice. Athletics? 27. I do another. Yes! 23. Can I look over my shoulder at the rogue? Because he's got the little dagger, right? Can I say Sit down before I open you up! And I would like to take off towards the guy that I was first engaged with that's at the back corner of the map with the rest of my movement. I have one attack left. Yeah. Reckless, please, chef. 25. 17, with two points of necrotic damage. I have Retaliation. I forgot about it. That's all right. If somebody tries to hit me within five feet with melee, I can hit him back but I forgot to do it. Nega-Percy! Well, that's one way to die. That's 29. Can I make that Great Weapon-- I have to say that before. 16 points of damage. One necrotic. Misses! That'll hit. Okay, halved to four. Hits. To 13? Yeah, can I lick the ice cream as it's melting out of me? Oh, six points per square? Who's Kynan? No, don't! Come on! You can't kill Kynan. She has a shield, right? That's not great. That's a six. At terminal velocity? Cool! Super cool, guys! Super cool! Well, I'm up in the air again. Of all the people who really shouldn't be in the air, I'm up in the air again. Oh, the metal ones? Fuck! (laughing) Oh, really? (laughing) Oh, man. Oh yeah. From six feet off the ground. Oh, god. But doesn't he go (whoosh) back to the pokeball? No, no, no. Why? Like, some Looney Tunes shit? (pew) And the head just stays there, and then (rushing wind). On the fall? Half? Persistent rage, baby. It's a new feat. Do it. End her. Finish her off. That hurt me. My hit points are actually in the double digits now. I know. I'm a little frightened. What is it? What are you even worried about? Yeah! Try and leave something that resembles baby food. Can I stand up, please? Oh, shit. Who's down in the crevasse down there? Who's the other one in the crevasse? Oh. Can I slide down to the goliath? (rock slide noise) Six points of damage? Okay. Can I make-- is she prone? Do I get advantage on that anyway, then? Can I make it great weapon master, please? Thank you. (quietly) I won't need it. That's even better. (counting) 32. No, minus five. 28. 32 points of damage on the first one with the great weapon master, five of which is necrotic. 32 on the first one. (chuckles) Yeah. That's a 28-- uh, 23. Man, doesn't it suck when you don't even get one fucking hit in on this fight? (laughter, groans) I'll give her a little extra (grunt) shove. I have one extra attack, but I will-- Nah. You know what, I'm good-- no, 25 feet. I probably can't climb out of there, right? Let's try it. 20. (snarling, growling, breathing heavily) That's it. Yeah, it did. Now you're doing the one-eyed blinky-wink. You taking a knee? Shit, that's hard. Are you serious? Dude, that was it! That was-- All I'm hearing is Jon Bon Jovi Living On A Prayer. (laughter) I'm so far away. Is that a charm? I'm marked. With vengeance? I have one question. If I wanted to try and double my speed or whatever, get around Orthax to Ripley, would I still be able to hit her at all, or would I have to burn all my attacks to get to her? The frenzy's the bonus. I grab my earring and I say, Orthax or Ripley? Can I burn that to get all the way-- Plus I did Reckless, so. It does hit. Do I get Retaliation? Is it a melee attack? Let's do that. 26. 27, with five points of necrotic. And I get all the way to Ripley? Nothing magic here, bitch. I will go reckless, Great Weapon Master at Ripley, please. 28. Why am I not always doing Great Weapon Master? What the fuck is the matter with me? 28, with a point of necrotic. What, the cloak not helping you with that one? What is that beautiful fragrance you're wearing? Wow, of all the things to roll. Yeah, you did. You had that coming more than anybody. Are you fucking kidding me?! Use your staff! Is the tether between he and Ripley physical? That seals it, buddy. Did you go unconscious? I'll leave that up to your discretion. Right now? Oh, it's my turn. Can I join Scanlan in the most Stevie Wonder search ever, with my bloodaxe being my stick? All right, I'll move over to where I am and hold my attack and hope I bump into something along the way. I've got persistent rage, so I don't lose my rage. Reckless. The chain is magic. It's magic. Yeah, I'm going to attach the chain and throw it. Reckless, Great Weapon Master. All right. Which one? All right, Gil. There's only one that could beat that one. So that's a 32 minus five. 28. I know. Fucker. 16, 18, 28. 28 with two points of necrotic. I yank it back. Got it. What was that? Goddamn it! Yes. Are you going to talk about how the Redskins lost to the Cowboys this last weekend? Oh, good. Why? What? I am offended. He rolls the spiky fucker. Oh my god. Come on. I think it's ten or higher, right? Are you shitting me? You rolled a fucking ten? Can I see Scanlan prepare for the bamf, and can I move to the other side of the last place I saw her? Okay, can I move opposite of him? Maybe a little bit further. Yeah, and turn toward that space, and I'll hold my action until I see her. Bitch. Yes! Reckless, great weapon master. That giant number again. That's 32 minus five. 28. We're good. 32. (laughing) I mean, I don't know. Is my axe still in her chest? I go and get my axe, because I'm still raging! And I hold my action in case she comes back. She does? I have three attacks. The roll didn't happen? I'd like to get right up next to the orb. When you are. Obliviate. Reckless, great, everything. 29. I'm going to take the axe and go straight across her navel. What just happened? She's depleted. Well, that went sideways.
