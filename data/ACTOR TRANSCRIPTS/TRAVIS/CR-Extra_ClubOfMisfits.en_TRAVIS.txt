That's it. Start making it up right now. On tonight's episode of-- Squidlach? First is the worst, tool. Yes. No, this is all Litish. (Spits) Nerd. My name's John Bunder. I don't give a shit about anything or anyone. Oh yeah, I forgot, yeah. We're all Litish. I'm also in house Smytherpin. Smytherpin! I've been here every day of my life and I'll probably be here even longer. This accent might change in a couple minutes, just so you know. You people are in here with me. Not me in here with you. Whatever. (tongue clucking) (fart sound) Yeah. I am. Sure. I want another. Great. Let's make it two! Bring it on. Perfect. No! Yep, Furbin. I should write that down. (mocking) My room for-- (mocking continues) I cast Fireball. No. Nope. Hey, Sporto. That seems like an illegal activity for someone of your repute. Aren't you worried that you're going to damage your ride? Tell them-- But I like where your mind's at. For me, I don't plan on staying in here the whole time. I see nothing but options in front of us. We all got these, don't we? Don't we? Let me do a little Detect. I detect limp noodle, core of wuss, pliant. Oh, I'll fuck you up in two seconds. Perception check. Three. You always do what you're told, Claire? Always? Miss Perfect? (snores) I'm with you, Andy. Let's do it. I dare you to-- Okay. What am I doing? Oh. Yeah. (blows raspberry) Can I go up to the door? Is it locked? It's not locked? Shut up. Probably not trapped, right? I mean, we're in a school. I got it. I'll just open the door. Oh, nice. Can I just open it? Oh! A map already?! That's probably dry-erase marker. Oh, we have us-es? Okay. Yeah. Are any of the portraits on the wall, are they paying attention to me as I walk up the stairs? Oh my god. Andy, look in the corner. Shh! Keep your voice down. Who's she? Professor Furbin? Nothing! There's a mirror and it just talks. Yeah, so how many of these little sprites are in the cage? Yes. Four arms, four legs? Do they have (clicking) pincers? What color are they? Okay, I'll keep an eye, you get him. Yeah careful, Claire. There's all sorts of exciting things in here. (Australian accent) Down under. While they're pleading, is there anything on the desk that looks like it might be worth snagging? I don't know. What's in it for us if we let you out? I'll start trying the drawers of the desk to see if they open. Sounds solid to me. Yeah! No. Is it locked? No, the cage. Anybody good with locks? Oh, I think I am! Oh. And where is that? Allison? You do it. Yeah. TALIESIN and Oh you prick. Fucking sprites. Bunder! Okay. 25 to 20. Ooh! Oh shit. I rolled an eight. Two nines and two eights? Bryan and Claire. And Andy. Yeah, you put eight enemies in that tavern. I've got spells. Spells. It's pretty cute. Come on, man! Bumblesnore is going to do a funeral for one of us real quick. Bring it! Bet you won't roll high enough, punk! (blows raspberry) No! Yeah, you would. They were after Allison? There's four. It's a detailed map. It's good, though! (shouting) Oh! Dang! You're so hot, babe. I am going to turn to this little sprite right here next to me and I'm going to cast Ray Of Frost. Yeah. "A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a "ranged spell attack against the target." Yeah, that one. That is a 12. Fuck! I think that's my turn. Ooh, you can make it green, too? I'm the rebel, bitch! Smytherpin! Oh, not cool. My AC's 12. Y'all, we got this. We're fine. Oh there you go, that's a big one. Pissed off, I cast Thunderclap at this sprite over here. Constitution saving throw. 14 I haven't done shit to this fucking sprite. I spit at it. I miss. I have sorcerer points, I don't know how that works, so I'm not using them. I don't know how that shit works, I don't have time for that. One Smytherpin army. Smytherpin. Bunder. Christ, thank you. Plus zero. No. Man, we got to start using bigger stuff. I haven't hit one of these fucking things yet. Oh! It's me. I'll run out down the stairs-- To the top of the stairs. Forget about me. I'll strike a pose and try Ray of Frost again. Yeah. It's instantaneous, ranged spell attack. Natural 20. Smoke this business. Okay, here we go. (counting) That's 12 points of cold damage. Listen, if you want to come give me a kiss, I won't, you know, turn it down. Likely story. Yeah! Me? Why would you blame me? Rugged good looks? I know. It's hard to imagine-- Love me? You love me? Want a kiss? I'm here all day. I mean, we've got detention together. Which tapestry did it start to tear at? I'll take that. She really wanted to be a Care of Magical Screechers teacher? Should we dispose of these sprites? Maybe a little prestidigitation to get rid of the gore on the walls? Yeah, so what's the story, right? They, like, broke out and got free and fled? Smart. She might be coming back, actually. I'm going to run to the classroom door and just put my ear to the door to make sure that no one's-- I can't hear anything. Ten. (shushing sounds) (whispering) Come here. Come here. Get over here. No, I hear people on the other side of the door. SAM and What are they saying? I can't hear. It's very subtle. Is the door to the classroom locked? I'll try the door, but just to crack it. I'll crack it a peak. What do I see? Anyone fancy a bite to eat? Yeah, why not? We say we were chasing after the sprites after they broke out, and we were trying to get them back for the teacher. Some what? BRIAN and She. You sit next to him all the time in class? Oh, she cheats! Witch-- I don't either, and while you two are flirting, I'll open the door and make my way out of the room. Yes, stealthy. Ooh, thank god for that. 22. Yep, plus ten. We could eat if we go to the left, or we could see what these whispers are about. All right, we go to the right. No, jolly old man. Down the stairs? Down that way? We don't know-- No, we've been in the classroom this whole time. All right, stay put! We'll turn around and head downstairs, or towards the stairs-- What's wrong with getting attacked by sprites? Well, as a Smytherpin, I'm not really, you know, concerned about people outside of my own house. You mean your parents did. Mmhmm. Are you really bad? Ten. Nobody's above a 12. No, we have one 14. 14's the tank. Under your shawls. (growls) In your Tiger Beat Magazine. Yes. (laughter) The door to the classroom is closed, yes? It's open. Just a quick peek in. Hello? Yeah. Can you do that? Oh! You're out of place up here, house elf. You're Dryffingor, right? Jeez! You might be in our house. Help to tell us? We do, yes. Something is fishy here. Our teacher runs out, the portraits are scared, and now one of the house elves tells us to meet her downstairs. I agree. Let's go. We head downstairs. Fuck! Six. Six. I do, too. Allison, a hand? I'll pull up Andy with me. Wands out. 26. We hustle in. Into the Great Hall? I didn't even know this room was here. Are you talking about the dungeons? Do we know how to go below? How convenient. Will we fit through? Are you sure? It could be dangerous. It could be scary. I bet you. Keep it up. Winning me over. Ward? (high-pitched voice) Robin. I'll be third. Yeah, I like it! You're doing so good, Headmistress. Is that it? It that how it works? Okay, we'll go to break. [break] Excuse me. Hello. We're looking for-- Is there an emergency in the East Wing? You lied? I cast Mage Hand and stop her from hitting herself. I'm sure you deserved it. It's okay. SAM and Don't lie to yourself. Oh, you were the one that captured the sprites and put them in her office? Do you know why she had you gather up the spider? Whoa, Beetle, did you gather it from the Dark Forest? We're not allowed to go into the Dark Forest. Oh! Should we plug this hole, then? It happens to us all at some point. It was many years ago, I barely remember. Now that-- Yes. I will go first into the hole. Yep. Didn't you have-- No problem. I will jump on that pillar and slide down. 13. Just like I meant to. Totally fine down here. No spiders. Don't judge. Oh yeah, by your left there. The most extensive collection of D&D imagery ever assembled. Yes! (screaming) Oh shit. Crazy that Schmogwarts would have a Lord of the Rings wizard's chess board. It's big. Yeah! 23. Not that these poor kids won't be in any danger. Do we see anything behind the chess pieces or the other side of the board across from where we are? Perception check. That is a 17. On the other side of the board? Okay. Do you think we have to play to get across the board? I'll take a step forward. Oh shit. Yeah, I picked a really shitty starting place. We need to figure out which pieces we are. You took me off. You want to be a bishop? A tree Ent. I'm a pawn. But I definitely took my two full things forward. That he clearly took two. I said I stepped forward. So now, we move next? Should I just dispatch the-- I will cast Acid Splash on that bitch. Yeah! All right, play carefully, I'm out here by myself. Yeah, I'm a pawn. It's not good. In a very bad starting position. Yeah, okay. Who's good at chess? Yeah, you can tell the pawns to move. You can't leave the board! Oh man. Are we in initiative? 25 to 20. Nobody. 16. Cool. Nein for Allison. Oh fuck! I'm at the top of the initiative, right? Okay. Yeah. Fuck it. I'm going to cast-- No, I should save it, right? Who knows. I'm going to cast Tidal Wave at this spider. 120 feet, 30 foot long, 10 feet wide, so maybe I can take a chess piece with me? You've got to make a dexterity saving throw of 15. 4d8s, so that's (counting)-- No, 17. Wow, that was a good roll. 23. That was like fives or sixes or something. It hits 23 points and knocks prone anything that it hits. It's 30 feet long, ten feet wide, so ten feet wide and ten feet tall. So let's say I did it this way. Yes. If they can survive 23 points of damage. Yeah. 23 total. So these are knocked prone. 23 to all three. 23 each. We did, we moved the pawn, right? That was our-- Now it's their turn in initiative or-- Nice! In melee? You have Andy, Claire, Allison, Bryan. Be brave. Oh yeah. If you haven't watched Breakfast Club, do it. All of it. Everything, there's no bad target. A little of both is double whammy. I love how wands naturally lend themselves. Nice. Yeah, it is. Maybe clear a path for the queen? (intones Mario theme) Yeah, Wyrmwood! SAM and Of course there's a Horfleporf badger. Yeah, do it, move a chess piece. Who were you shooting that at? Still up? Whatevs. Aragorg. We don't have a flapolisk around, do we? A flapolisk? Spiders flee before a flapolisk. Oh, yes, I will-- I'm going to come here, take this out, and I'm going to use-- I'll cast Aganazzar's Scorcher 30 feet down this (counting), hitting those two. You've got to make a dexterity saving throw, 15. (counting) 14 points of damage for the knight, seven for the pawn. For the knight, and seven for the pawn. Both of them? Seven. Was hoping that would be more than that. Oh shit. Definitely hits. Yeah! Eight points of damage. What? Andy's before Claire. Hard to keep track of them over this short hobbits. Most are like five. Should have put Mage Armor on myself. 18? Excellent! Got some sweet battle damage. No, I'm in doubles. I'm in double digits. Is that 36 points of damage?! I'm unconscious. Am I pushed off the board near the spider? Good. (whispering) Help! Oh my god. I'm going to die. Oh my god. Well, actually, that one can't hit me, but the spider can. The struggle is real. Ugh. Boobs. Starts playing snake. She's back! (burps) Death saving throw. Seven. We're fighting D&D on a chess board. I don't know what else is in store. No short rest. Grease? Did you move a piece? Ten points. I'll take it. Yeah, buddy! Thanks for the save, though. Weed? 13 points? (panting) I fucking hate chess. I'm more of a checkers guy. I'll cast Fireball, my last 3rd-level spell, right at the king. Yeah. You have to make a dex save of 16. Nice! 8d6. (counting) 28. We have a move? I'll just go here (sizzling). Is it? Would you say it's been thunderstruck? I cast Dispel Magic on your fucking accent. Plus eight. Not bad, dweeb. Not bad. Yeah! Smytherpin! Oh, I am up? Amazing. That's crazy. I will cast Agana-- Agazzna-- Yeah, no! The scorcher! At the big spider-der. Yep. Dex save of 15. Shit. All right, so you take half of (counting) 15, so seven. Seven points of damage. With my bonus action, I'll wink at Claire. Mixes in with the dandruff. Just the one? Not even scared. Uh-huh. Nice job, sporto. I cast Friends and they make out! No, I'm just kidding. You just killed Taliesin. Ooh. TRAVIS and One more chance! I have an unhappy home life. I do care about things. Avada! Do you have a plortbee or do we have to run back? All right, yeah. Double dash. Haul our ass back upstairs. Yeah. (running noise) 13. Furbin. Yes! Yes! 31. Oh boy. Hold that freeze frame! Oh my god. Yeah! Laura! It had wizard's chess. Holy shit! Oh my god. How was it? How was your first one shot? DM seat. How much of an inspiration was your son, Ronin? Happy "Harroween!"
