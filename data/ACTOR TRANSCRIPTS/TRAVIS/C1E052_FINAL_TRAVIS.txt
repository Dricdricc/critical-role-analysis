I think if David Bowie can't keep you alive, I don't know what can. Original War of the Worlds and The Day the Earth Stood Still prints? Yeah. There's an invasion box, a quest box, and a power box, but we don't have that yet. Go to Loot Crate, click the link. Show some love. He's got glorious hair, though. (laughs) Which is weird. Who would write that? Do your pants also have photoshopped lightning coming out of the crotch? Percy. Percy! Taliesin! You're on that roof, right? Because he's fucking evil. Who said that? I will beat him with my fists. 18. It's like a roller coaster. We're just going tick-tick-tick-tick-shooom. I'll have to look, but I think it hits. These aren't Great Weapon Master, right? Before he does that, you said 17 on the first one, 11 on the second attack, and how much necrotic on the second one? I rolled a five, plus what? My strength? 13? If you hit him, does he become not paralyzed? He's paralyzed. Can I walk around to the front of Kevdak? No. My hands are fucking shaking. This is the most epic map ever, by the way. Can I walk around to the front of Kevdak, please? Knowing that he pointed up with a hand at Scanlan's beautiful ass, hand still on his greataxe, paralyzed, can I try and rip-- continuing my rage because he hit me last round-- can I pull the axe from his hand? 27. Because I'm frenzied raging, do I have another move? Like, can I hit him with it? Can I, looking at the axe, say, oh, I do hope you have a necromancer in your group, because I'm looking at a fucking dead man. (laughter) Well, he did it against me so I get it against him. Oh, that's much better. 20. I don't know what the attack bonus is with the axe. Okay. Where is it? Jesus. This one? Plus what? Ah. So five. And it hit him, right? So is it an automatic critical because it hit? So it was a two. Do I have any of my movement left, can I move around behind him? 50. I'll either flank him or, yeah. I love you. Oh my god, are you serious? Yeah yeah! Yes! Misses. That hits. I can't use it on this stuff, though. Only when I attack. Reduced to seven? Okay. No. Whatever you're going to do. Just do it. What, what was it? What 15? 17. Okay. 32, halved is 16, which is eight. Misses. Yes, that hits. Oh, Scanlan! I will make out with that fucking shirt, I swear to god! So in my frenzied reckless attacking, great weapon master, can I bring my axe up high and swing it for the first attack to his left side where dangly hand is? Disadvantage for the? Okay. 23. No. 18. (counting) 20 for the first one. 30, with great weapon master. 60. 11. Which is seven. Or eight. Rage bonus is eight. Oh sorry, the total bonus is eight. That's why that's a seven. That's it. Right. Right, okay, so whatever. 11. Five, so that's 34. And a nine, so that's 43. And that's the first one, called shot. Second attack, straight across his back. That is a 22. Yeah, 22. Okay. And that's four, so double this-- 12, right? So four times two is eight. Plus four is 11. Math is a bitch. And two more of them? Because it's a critical? Okay. Seven. And a nine. So I have my third frenzied attack for a bonus action, right? With my bonus action I have one superior healing potion. Can I take that? 8d4 plus eight? Fuck me, asshole. Fuck. Fuck me asshole! Seven. Nine. Ele-- 12. 14. 16. 19. 20. 20. Can I, can I-- huh? I can't pick it up, I can only move. No, I'm going to, can I move, if I stay in his flank, if I move away from the three guys that are surrounding me, they're-- I'll stay. Yes, thank you. I can feel my heartbeat in my face. 18. Does your piece of paper back there look like Stephen Hawking's chalkboard? Young Stephen Hawking. You horrible, horrible person. Hits. Okay. Don't say the word yet. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Bladestorms? That'll miss. I haven't said that much tonight. That misses. That hits, yeah. We might as well just be doing this on a treadmill, because I think I'm pretty close to 130? She's trying to medevac me. Well. Yes. Yeah, she gave you, she handed out, before we moved out. Can we do some recreational drugs or something? Take the edge off? He kills one of his subordinates for letting him-- 140. We have to hit him for 140. I have the worst headache right now. What a call. What. A. Call. I know, I forget about it too. I forget about it too. How high? And I am willing. Yeah. And a big windup as we're coming down. Any chance I can make this reckless? Oh, thank god for that. Natural. 20. Look at it. The first one was a one. Brutal Critical is one additional damage die during critical hits. That's true. That's right, that's three. So ten. 12. So that's 22. And a ten. For a 32. Yeah, double the first, right. Which was ten, so 20, so 42. I say For Strongjaw! And I sink the axe right into his neck and part him perfectly down the middle. Yep. Nope. Don't care. That will put me unconscious and 21 points under. I have Relentless Rage. You're pointing at the screen. Okay. My herd. Hear me. Fallen is your mighty leader Kevdak, the very goliath swine who would have domesticated you like a common household cat, who would have made you bend a knee to a mere dragon. I show you this. And I reach into the Bag of Holding and I pull out one of the dragon's teeth that is still in there and I toss it into the middle of the square. I would tell you that under the correct rule, and a return of power to this Herd, dragons would bend a knee to the Herd of the Storm. Where is Zanror? Oh, you mistake me, Seer of the Herd. I do not mean to lead this herd, but rather to empower you to more powerful game. I'm here to inspire your aspirations. Never would I ask you to bend the knee. Only would I ask you to live and fight and perhaps die in the most beautiful death you can possibly attain. Join me and my fellows. Come to our aid when I call. And with that, we will chase down dragons, gods, and more. Fuck. That's only an 11. Hold! It is not necessary. Brothers, look me in the eye. Has the taste of food lost its appeal? Has the zest for life fallen from your hearts? Living in this domesticated dwelling. I promise you this hear me, and I promise you adventures and glory that is worthy of this herd. Cousin. Your face seems a little different. Scanlan. Lower me down. On the ground. I take a few steps forward. Yes. This my work. A debt fulfilled after many, many years. Strange. I would ask, why is he in shackles? What did Zanror do that would draw this sort of ire from the Herd? I am sorry, Zanror. But I will make it a glorious death. Bring me the gauntlets as well. I stand. Put on the gauntlets. Zanror. Quiet yourself. I've heard enough. And I lift the bloodaxe and I say you are a disgrace to this herd and I will return this herd to power. And I pivot, and I drive the bloodaxe into Greenbeard. Reckless? That's an 11. So that's 15. And then two more? That's 27. 37. It seems all the poison came from his head, so I'll remove that from his body. I spin and I say do you see? Do you see what staying in one place does? This is what weakness looks like. I would return you to the wild. I would return you to power. But you will have to do it under this goliath's rule. Unchain Zanror. Worra. I don't. Zanror, she is quite a beauty. Congratulations. No. This is honor. This is pride. This is a life worth living. How many do you number? More than we need. And I grab my earpiece and I go, (meekly) thoughts? (laughter) All right. All this bloodshed is giving me a terrible itch in my ear. We shall stay with you and tomorrow we will bathe in the blood of a dragon. Yeah, strength and honor! It shall be. Could you do me a favor? Could you butcher me a skull of Kevdak, please? I would like to not only remove Kevdak's head, just the upper part, no jaw, just the skull, and I would like to use the bloodaxe to flay the skin around the bear tattoo off. I'll take the plus-one javelins. And I'd like to put the flayed skin in your refrigerated bag. Are there any other goliaths in the square that are lingering? Can I walk over to one? Tonight we prepare for an incredible battle. Go. Release any meager prisoners you may have kept. They will do nothing for our fight. I did. And your claim is fair. Yeah. Have at it. Yeah, Thunderlord! I say that in my head. Oh fucking shit, yes, may I please? Yup. Yup. I was like, we might as well make it cool, because we're dead. Dude. Yes. Give it up for the fucking bard. Who has an article in Dear Vox Machina. What is riposte? Oh. Holy shit. That's that half-fighter side, right? That was fucking amazing. No no, that would've been it. Yeah. Yep. I know, look at the face, you saw it too, didn't you? The shadow of a man that wished he could have butchered somebody and didn't quite get to. (laughter) Why don't you mention the Loot Crate link again? Yeah, it's a bash. Every time around we're like, aha!
