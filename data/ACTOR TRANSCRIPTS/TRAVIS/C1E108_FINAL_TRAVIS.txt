Time jump, backwards. Oh my god, they're so shiny. Yeah, baby. But matches the same shape? Is their head height about the same height as the seal and the crossbeams? 17. What are things like this considered? Creatures or golems? She called me "bro." Game of Thrones is obviously back on the air. Yeah, they can't throw those greatswords, right? Helps a lot. Right. Standing by the blacksmithing stuff, I say, you are interrupting Grog's arts and crafts! And I would like to rage. And I would like to charge at that little bastard right there. Yes, please. Up into your face! Reckless, regular strike. Not terrible. 29. Hey, that's good. 28. The second one. Reckless, great weapon master. Just because. That's a million. That's 34 minus five is 29! Five, nine, 21, 31. 31 points of damage. And that ends my turn. You'll be fine. Yeah man, when we got pushed in the playground, that got in your head. Like a WWE cage match. This could be real bad. We might get total-partied right here. Whichever one's better. Acrobatics. I thought it was just going to slam you into the ground! (singing) You whip your hair back and forth. (screams) This is the coal pit! (laughter) Yeah. Like the McDonald's ball pit. Oh god, yeah. So that's a one, right? Fire bad! Is good? Yes, it does. That hits. 30 points of damage. Oh yeah, they both hit. Of course. What is that? Damn! Away, the guy behind you or the one across the pit? I have made fire. It's going to turn this room into a sauna. As if Vax needed any other reason to hide. I don't know that TV show. It's 20 and an 18, that's pretty good. Did you Hunter's Mark him? Vax! All right, this guy can obviously play heavy. Reckless, great weapon master, can I make the first attack, I'm going to try for the first time-- Yeah, right. I do, I know. I'm sorry, I get confused! I'm going to try a trip attack with my new maneuvers. It's a d8, right, that's added-- Okay. Reckless, great weapon master! 30 minus five is 25. So 11, 27, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. And he's tripped. Oh, he has to make a strength saving throw. Oh! Okay, cool. 26. 76. I want to hit it again! Reckless, great weapon master. Thank god for that. Seven. Shit, that might not be so good. 20. Oh, it hits. Okay. One, seven, 17! Oh, 17 plus ten, so 27. 27. Can I spend an action surge to do one more strike into his Gallagher-afflicted chest. Reckless, great weapon master! That's a lot. 16, 20, 34, 29. Oh shit! 21, 31. Nice. No, 29 was the hit, and 31 was the damage. Can I turn (cracking) to my right in my rage and start running across the room to Old Stupid Butt on the wall? 50 feet. Last one! Reckless, great weapon master! That's a million. 35, 30? Okay. Five, 21, 31. You are frenzied raging right now. I looked in the trap, Ray. That's an eight-ounce cup. It's a normal cup of coffee. You can caffeinate half of Burbank right there. Can I look at the golem, the construct that's down by me? Is his face, the triangle face, is it detachable? Can I remove it from the rest of his person? Hold onto your butts. That's a one. And I will do it the old fashioned way. 22. Look, it's just like the one above the coals! That's an interesting phrase. We're not supposed to like, kissy-face the heads to make some sort of a 3D shape? Good deal. Sounds like a plan. Can I go over and archaically remove the other two noggins? 23. One more. Do you want to help me with this one, too? Yeah! What's wrong with your voice? 18. We got the ashtrays. All right. We head over to the smelting apparati. You can't just run through you, like Universal City Walk or something? Okay. 24. Can I try? I run across the coal pits and Superman punch the pyramid. I rage before I do this. That's what I was hoping for. 21. Should we try turning it? All right, I walk up into the coals, take the platinum pyramid out, and I'll drop it down into the coals. Shit. Can I jump, Boots of Feral Leaping? I drop it in the coals. Has the platinum pyramid started to heat up yet? I drop it in the coals. You know what, I feel like, I feel like, this is stupid. I pick them up. (pained gasps) Tell me where they go Negative two. Nine. Asshole! Son of a bitch! What? The triangles are like this big and the armor is like massive. 19. Volcanic glass metal. Aha! Do I know if volcanic-- It's-- It's a type of metal-- Yeah, I'm following you on it. (laughs) Bring on the Night King. Melt them down into each of the three. It comes, it comes in waves. It's like a new awakening. Can somebody go pull that thing out, and then I will put this one in? Can I run up and MJ the new gold pyramid into the--? An intelligence check? Oh, because I got to put them together. Two! I'm making an origami swan. I grab the platinum pyramid and I put it in the Bag of Holding. Scanlan, face death with me! It's just going to reveal another stairway, come on. Did you guys see National Treasure? What? 16. Is that sound still happening? Can we see the source of the sound? Can we see what's causing that yet? Well, look. Before we step into that arena, we control this space. How quick and quiet can you be, to see if he responds to your movement? Yeah. See if he reacts to you. Yeah, do it. This is what you do. We might. Oh man, Swedish Chef over here. Yeah, on that one. Well, strength is way better than dex. Percy, I'm not afraid, go talk to this thing. I'm right behind you. Me, too. How about this? I'm not afraid. If he takes offense, I'll take it better than most. I am in the front now. Can I use my Second Wind? Just because. Heal 13 points. I am consciously checking my beard. Am I standing at the anvil now? Can I see where the chains are leading or are they just dangling off? Give me the platinum. Well, put it together first, please. Thanks. With the platinum, I will approach the anvil. I stop. Did I? No. Do I see any blacksmithing tools, anything that I would use to hammer this? Oh, that's hanging off? Flat. Edge. That does feel like a ready, set. LAURA and I take one step back. I'm pretty sure that would be 150 points of damage. I'm picturing the anvil right in front of me and he's off to the side, right? And the hammer is somewhere between me and him? Seven. Oh, it went hanging off. Yeah, but I've got to get to the anvil to do that. Shit. Okay, cool. Instead of walking towards the anvil, can I start walking to the right, towards one of those chains that's dangling on? Is it tilting it down? Okay. Can I keep moving in that direction? I'll stop. Well, he might swing at the thing if it got closer. So unless we're short on ideas, we might have to starburst this thing. Scatter it. Ioun helped, Pelor helped. You thinkers better think. We still can't see what's sending up those? What about an Oracle Arrow? Yeah. Yeah, like tee-ball. Oh, that's really unfortunate. I get advantage on those, and that was terrible. 20 to 15? For the love of god? When the DM smirks like that. Look at him winding up. This is awful. That'll hit. Can I try my parry maneuver? It uses your dex modifier plus the-- I'm going to try. Seven plus two. Nine? I'm not raging. Okay. 18, with a minus two. Okay. Anybody else? Lights out for anyone else? No big deal. 23 misses? I'm blind! It's very hot! It's very hot! On the ground, and I'm blind! Yeah, great, thanks! What do you sing? Is that Sisqó?! Well done! How about you go first? Cool. Can I use my action to get up from being prone? Half my movement, sorry. Onto one knee. In my mind, because I can't see! And can I hold my action until I can see again or until it's my turn? Until I can see again. Crouched, so both hands are on the ground. Oh my god, really? Shit, y'all. Fuck. Probably should have cast the mansion door before we started. It takes a minute to cast. That's a lot of dice he's picking up. I feel like you're filling a playground with gravel right now. I feel like he's playing putt putt golf with us. Cool. Oh, right, then I held my action for that. Should I try and smith? Yeah, but what purpose would it serve? I could try. Yeah. Maybe he'd stop moving if I grabbed the hammer? Oh, but I held my action until I had sight. You're on the hammer, aren't you? Should I try pulling up the hammer and see if that does something? Okay, I'll try and pull the chain up to grab the hammer. I will rage, and that's it. Can I turn around and look, now that I'm right up next to the Core Anvil, is there anything that I'm noticing about it that would move or knock off? A switch or a button? Doesn't look just like a flipping anvil. Yeah, okay, cool. That's a two. I never see shit! 190. There are four chains hanging off of the thing, and we all know the hammer is attached to one. Don't they have truesight and stuff? Yeah. It's hammer time. I'm going to run down here-- five, ten, 15-- right there, to this side. And I'll take both of my attacks at the giant death-bringer. Just reckless, not great weapon master. Hoping for a crit, which was not it. 31. Great. That's better. 32. No, not great weapon master. Just reckless. Six, 22 for the first one. And I can't disarm him; he's a giant. And 20 for the second one. He's gargantuan, though. And that is it. That hits. Can I use my stone's endurance to reduce that further? Yeah, I was going to do it afterwards. I thought he did two hits backwards? Okay, yeah. I'll do the retaliation. Okay. Oh shit. It's that fucking sword. Right. Thank you. Going to need it. 20. I'm going to use my inspiration. 28. Okay! Reckless, great weapon master. Why not? That's 31 minus five, that's 26? Nice. Fuck. 27. That was a shit roll. I rolled a one. Oh! I reroll ones! Sorry. Reroll ones. Thanks. 12! That's way better! (cheering) 28, 38. Come on, dude. That's what it is. 24. 26. Come on, you sweet chinchilla. Yeah. I do. Reckless, great weapon master. 30. Okay. For 30 points of damage. Yep. Come on, baby! But I'm in melee, so if he leaves, I can hit him. All I see is wicked Davy Jones wanting to chop us to pieces. Yeah, please, shoot me in the neck. I'm right under his foot. I'm right there. Okay. Cool. Can I take my retaliation? You are right. Okay. We're good. I'll go. I piñata swing, reckless, great weapon master. Single. Don't fuck me, Gil. Blacksmith die for a blacksmith thing. That's not great. That's a miss. Yeah. 20 minus five is 15. Well, I have one more. I'll make it reckless and not great weapon master. Natural 20. It's been so long since I've done this, I don't remember how this works. Okay. So it's three times the thing. Which is 16. Yeah, I've been forgetting the fucking-- 1d6 necrotic damage. A one, 51. And a seven, so 58. I'm like Tony Stark in the Hulkbuster armor. I'm sorry! Go to sleep! Yes, that's the end of my turn. One hit point. Zero is unconscious. Yeah, that hits. I'll take the retaliation after, as well. Skipping across! Can I take my retaliation attack? Reckless, great weapon master. 34 minus five. 29. 23, 33. Yeah, you're all good. Yeah, right here. Super cute elemental, chasing me like a puppy. I'll go. Turn straight at him, reckless, great weapon master. That's going to be enough. Come on, crit. No. Okay. Okay. I'm going to keep that roll just in case something happens. Which it does. 24. Right. Minus five, is 31 to hit. It was a great roll. And the second one is pretty big. 34 minus five is 29. 17 plus ten is 27 for the first one. Oh, nope. I'm sorry! That was a one, so I'm going to re-roll it. Five, 21, 31 for the first one. Second one. Three, 29, and my fucking necrotic dice. Two, four more. That does. Actually, can I move? I'm going to stay in melee, but I want to come over here in case he decides to golf-swing me into the fucking lava river. That's the reason I roll so high most of the time. So that's 37? Yeah, 24. I can still see? We just had three fights in the same day. Is he unconscious still? I'm in double digits, which is uncomfortable for me. 53. Yeah, I got my ass handed to me. Two crits by that giant bastard. I know. I'll take, though. It's worth the gamble. Well, that was a bitch. What do you say we cut to the chase and hammer this shit out? There's a big splash up against the wall, but it's just water. 21. I do, but still. Four. Five. I would like to go to the top where the Core Anvil is and start pulling up each of the tools that are hanging by the four chains. Can I tell what material the black part of the hammer is made out of? If it's rock, metal, some sort of volcanic glass? I have the chunks of platinum. I hand the chunks of platinum over to Percy to put the-- I guess they don't have to be in-- So we should do that, right? Cool. Kicking my feet, which doesn't make it any easier. I'm not still raging, unfortunately. 23. We hurry to the other room. Oh that's right, that's the one. Thank you. So 4,500. So enough for three trammels. Which I have advantage. Oh, advantage. Right. I got it. 19. I still have the Alchemy Jug with the water in it. I love this. Who's got the beads? LAURA and Can I go into a rage? (heavy breathing) That's even better. 25. Do we fold this into one of the ingots? One at a time? That is a 19. Whose bead is up next? Persistent rage. I'm raging balls this whole time. I do not. Wisdom. Unparalleled wisdom! Oh, that's amazing. Yeah. 25. 17 plus eight. Advantage because of the Cat's Grace. It's a 19. Oh, it is? 27. Bead. I reach into my pouch and I take out one of my peas that I got, and I put it on the anvil. Raging strength check. Okay. It's inspiration time. I'm going to use the dice. It's a 24. But my arms are really sore. I need a massage. By whose standards, yours or mine? All right. No. Come on, Gil. That's dog shit. I'm not even going to use the inspiration because it won't get us there. Well, now hold on. I would have to roll a 12. Of a d12. Ten. (panting) I'll try one more time. One more. No inspiration. Hold on. Let me try it without the inspiration. Let me try. Let me do it straight up. I didn't need it. 25 on the dot. I've never been so happy to see a 17 before. Oh my god. I've got advantage. Is it strength or dex? But I get a d4 on top of it? Oh, that's great. 26 without the other stuff. Then I'll keep that. And then what was the Guidance? Do I have Guidance any more? It's a 15 with advantage. Because it's my dexterity modifier plus my proficiency bonus, right? Advantage, right? My god. That's better. Okay. That's a 24. Should I use the inspiration? 29. No, we got to put the runes in. (sobbing) I'm tired of this. It's a 26. It's okay. (panting) Okay. Okay, give me the cool thing. I'm too tired to be upset about it. I do have the Dwarven Thrower. Me too. 15? Smart move. Slow down! TALIESIN and I don't have anything; I just hit things! One at a time. And we have the inspiration for the third one. Come on. Jesus. These are obviously too dangerous for this world, and I walk over to the lava. (laughter) Yeah, it's true. No? And if we go into the mansion, the first purple servant that hands me a salad, I behead unless it's the GoFiBePo. We'll do it live! That fucking giant sword-swinging bastard! Is he even wearing underpants under that? We don't know. Legendary action the nut swing.
