Natural one. What do you want to do? What's all this action down here? That hits. Excellent. He takes ten points of ice damage, or frozen damage or whatever. LAURA and Oh, from hitting my frozen porcupine armor? That's not great. Oh that misses, 15. 17. Really? Oh no! We're in big trouble, you guys. I'm going to cast Eldritch Blast into the pot in the bottom of the cage. That's not going to hit, that's a three plus-- 11. Oh does it? Wait I added that wrong; hold on. (stuttering) I'm pretty sure I added that wrong. Yeah no, that's only a nine. Great, cool, awesome. Can I run? Can I use my speed-- are they both in melee range? (high pitched laugh) Okay. I'll stay right where I am, then. Misses. (stuttering) That hits. Ten points of cold damage to that particular wispy bastard. Doesn't she have Sentinel? Boom! Speed is zero. Plus five, for your strength and rage. Plus five. Oh, wow. Is that a divine thing? Who has that sword we pulled off? Need a defib. I don't really like my position right now. Aw, that was so considerate. Who's the lowest? Blood coming out of her mouth. Yeah, well this is a bitch, ain't it. I'm going to try Eldritch Blast again at the pot, through the cage. At disadvantage, because I got to take one of those out of the picture somehow. Oh, I think that might work, 14. Outstanding. That is a big plus for me. Ten plus four, 14! With my bonus action, can I move my Hex onto el shadow figure? Disadvantage on wisdom saving throws. Wisdom ability checks, thank you. Yeah, sure. Sharpshooter! It's cool. There's actually one wisp actually next to somebody. Thank you. Carve this turkey. That hits. Whoa, that was a big one. Shit, okay. Disadvantage, or regular? 14. Does that affect his wisdom ability checks? The Hex? 18. That thing is a bitch. I've got one more with your name on it, sweet cheeks. You hush your mouth. I'll spin around and try and Eldritch Blast that last pot in the other cage. At disadvantage. That's a 19! That's 11 points of damage! Got him. Why? You're strong! You can do it. Come on! (singing) Get it, girl. Get it, get it, girl. Like Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters 2. We should take a short rest. A breather, yeah. The worst! It's the worst! Suddenly I'm scared of falling on the beach. Natural? Yeah, you can. ASHLEY and Yay! That's seven! What about that cloak? Can I come up and see if it has any magic feel to it? 17. Weird. Looks like it's been burned a bit. It's got a little compartment in the front. I don't know. You want to try it on? There was that one book on the desk. This is one of the ones in the cages, right? Hey Yasha, you feel like knocking the shit out of some of those cages, opening them up? Can I walk to the entrance to the tunnel, just to keep an eye out, while he does his thing? 13. That's very considerate of you, Nott. Not a good sword-- Oh shit. If they're casting something, it breaks it? If they had, like, a Hold Person up it could dispel it? (laughter) I don't mind. He's redacting his own card! The idiot goliath kept it for five years. Are you sure it's not on the table? Anything else in the hallway moving? Yeah, just to clear it out. Plus, if you give them all the rings, they might give us a job with more fancy stuff next time. It's pretty obvious you're going to have to hide it if we walk back in there. No, I don't think we do. Yeah. We didn't see any other exits, right? Which is weird because it was all caved in. Can you mend the transportation circle? I will make one too, but I'm not going to count it. I rolled it, but-- A 20. I feel like I remember something about a real larva-looking worm. Huge fucking thing. MATT and Yeah. Locked away after the Calamity, but real nasty. Not really, it's more like I remember from a dream or something. Kind of hard to remember if it happened to me or not. No. I don't think so. Could be. How do you do that? As per usual. Yeah, what are they made of? Can we tell what kind of metal those candlesticks are made of? Fuck yeah, man. Melt that down. Natural one. Pretty sure it's aluminum. I forgot we got that. We should probably get back. We've been here awhile. Well, we almost were. We head out. No problem. Current goes away from the direction we came from? We could see what's down the river a bit. We're already out this far. Might as well see where it goes for a little bit. Sure. We could do that. I'll go forward. We'll be back. We're just taking a little look. Keep an eye on the roof, remember? We could check out the other cavern and save the deeper part of the river for when we're together. Yeah, we're fighting up. I get behind Jester and start massaging her traps. Is there land off to the sides of the bottom of the waterfall? I'm not letting him go by himself. I do the same thing. Darkvision. Do I see anything? That's bad luck. No scratches in the walls or any pouches or compartments on the floor around this little space? Natural 19. What do those manacles look like? Oh, we could use those. I'll walk over and I step on the elbow joint and snap it. Yep, put the manacles over and I'll jump back in. Yeah, that's what I was going to say. Can I aid him or help him do something? Jester, give me a hand? I am 185 easy, okay? I think we're good to go back and join the others, yeah. We should actually go back inside and use the entrance as a good funnel. Don't leave ourselves in the open. Yeah, it is. Yeah, the top-- or the bottom. The bottom? Yeah, because the bottom one with the things, the traps blockers-- You don't know that! Take your time! It's all good. Oh no. Oh god. Consume. Oh god, am I going to try to swallow the sword? It's a large blade, right? I don't know what you mean, consume? Fuck it, I'll turn the blade over and keeping my eyes on the big eye, I'll bring it up to my mouth and open it. I'll-- Anything in my hands? I wipe my mouth. Can I try and summon the sword? I try and keep my-- (clears throat) Fu-- Make it disappear again. Has anybody woken up? Are any eyes open at all? I'll lay back down and go to sleep. Holy shit! Oh, you crazy motherfucker! Wow, good call back. Standard deviation. (robot voice) What is Greek? (laughter) Oh, yeah, I fucking grind my teeth. No, no, nope. Just bit myself in my sleep, that's all. Thank you, Jester. I appreciate-- Yup, I pull down my lower lip. You see very short, nubby teeth, with scratches and divots and chips on the top. Just on the-- Yeah. I did. That would have been a better excuse. When I was younger, they used to make fun of my teeth. Kids can be cruel so I decided to take away the target that was most easily available for them. Yeah, at the time there weren't any others like me. I feel like I was especially picked on for my teeth. Not necessarily. It became a habit. I'm sure I don't have to. It's like people who chew their nails, I guess. They are persistent. Not super fast. No. I think I bit my lip. Yeah, right, and then you bite it again the next day. Bod mod? No, I did not. No. I didn't have that sort of a streak in me then. I was a bit tougher than most of the other kids. I felt like I could take the physical poking, but the jeering, I-- You know, it's not even really that intentional. I'll find myself picking at them every once in a while. Like to grow back? LIAM and Yeah, there are times. I've seen them other half orcs with the teeth. He did, yeah. I feel like it's a trait that exemplifies the rougher side of my race, so sometimes I wish I had them, and sometimes I'm glad I don't. I think it's how I'd like to see myself. You saying I should let them grow out? All right, fair. How about, you see me picking at them, or chipping at them or any of that shit, you just say the word and I'll stop. LAURA and Yeah. Eyes on the ceiling as well because that's where danger came from. Hey, that's way better! Thank you. A 17. Boat rowers! (whistles) Yeah, it was not really much of a test for us. That's true. Can we just, forego those? I feel like this is going to be the beginning of a very fruitful relationship, surely. Right up the butt. Apologies for our poor timing. Hopefully we weren't interrupting? Really not that big of a deal. There were some will-o'-wisps, some floating spirits. There was, actually, yes. Indeed. Good thing you sent the pros. Amateurs probably would have had a worse time. You are not Scanlan anymore! (laughter) There was a fair amount of jewelry. There was. Look, we know who has them. We know. There was a destroyed-- looks like a transportation circle inside. Bodies. Lots of bodies. A lot of bodies. Four, because there were two pairs. Yeah. So tired. I start eating. That's great! I appreciate you seeing him to safety. Baller. Thank you for your consideration and time. We'll be in touch, shall we? He can follow us. That's fine. That's right. You sure you don't want to sell off any of your extra wares? Sure. Put him at ease? Oh. Yeah, of course. Head back that way. I think he was trying to upset the government, right? Create fractures, hope pressure would make things snap in the end? Maybe he's been hedging his bets for a while. Good to keep in mind. I'd normally, but I feel like he knows you. Walk up. Double tap, followed by a single. Safe. To Berleben. Of course. It was the least we can do. We trust with this information and the right things occurring in the next few days, you can find your way to some prosperous moves for this city. Nice. Really? Just for sport? That could be a nice change of pace. You want to tell her. She is not a child! While they're figuring it out, on one of the days can I make my way by Ren Sutan's physician's office? I want to casually look on the outside, see if it's still in business, see if it's still bustling, or if anything has come their way. Can I use my Mask of Many Faces, and I'll adopt an older face with a gray beard and a dark hood, and can I walk into the physician's office? (as Sean Connery) Yes, hello. (laughter) (as Sean Connery) Is Ren Sutan there? (laughter) (as Sean Connery) Just get him. Nine. (Sean Connery voice peters out) You don't want his trouble with the Myriad to spill over to you, do you? Fetch him. Now. I fucking lost it. (as Sean Connery) Do your best. Losers always whine about their best. I'll turn and follow him. 17. I will turn on my heel and use my Mask of Many Faces to turn into a lovely woman. I make my way back to The Leaky Tap. What time are you starting? Hey Caleb, you want to take a look at the pouch? I'm holding it in my fucking hand. Don't you see it? I'm not going to take it. I was letting you know I'm bought it. Yeah, here. I don't know where they're going, but I think we got to babysit them. Are you guys going on a walk? I'm babysitting them. Glad I got another pouch of this stuff, could come in handy. Let's get you to a bathhouse. You were eating dirt about ten minutes ago. Said it was snow. Yeah, you got a big mud goatee. Was it a powder, or was it like crumbles? Shall we get you cleaned up? Nott cleaned up? Yeah, whip it out and shove it in his hand. Like what? (whispers) Always remember your first one. (whispers) Well, shit. That's awesome. I want to do that obstacle course. (whispering) Dodecahedron, next night! Come on! Dish. Or you could just tell us. Yeah, we'll share in this adventure with you. Yeah! Skydive, baby. Oh shit! What is it called? It's a--? Nice job, Matt! Those always go well. Only him.
