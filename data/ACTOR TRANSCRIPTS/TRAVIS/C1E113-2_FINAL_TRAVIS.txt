I got the numbers wrong. Totally. It's super flexible. Slavic. Listen, I have not bathed a short sword in blood under the cover of dark in so long! I want to sneak up, and I want to take their bowels and pull them out while they sleep. But! We have to take care of that one that's watching guard, first. Who's sneaky? Naw, are you sneaky? Can you look? I do! I like it! Yeah, or you crack a branch, right? (cracking noise) Can I aid her? Can I aid her with my Minor Illusion? Let's make it, like, a two-headed owl. (hooting and gurgling) (harmonizing) Hoo! I take the crossbow and I try to put it right in the back, where his head meets his neck. 20. Okay. Natural 20. Okay. d8 plus four. Eight, (counting). 16, 19, 22. I can cast Sleep. Oh shit. Shh! I thought he said quietly! I'll cast Sleep on them. Yeah, with like, sleeping powder and herbs. I untie the top of it and I go, (whoosh). Oh shit, well, I'm sure-- 32. The other three are? That's the best I got. And I choose? I choose which one-- It says I choose-- 21. I need to be a little intelligent bastard from now on. I'll take the nearest one with my crossbow and fire. Is he within melee range of him, for sneak attack? Probably not, because he's working on the guy with the throat, right? 15. Nice. That does seven points of piercing damage. Are we hopping off down a cliff, or are we running in toward where they are? I'm going to stay up on my perch. But I can only hide or disengage or-- Oh, well, let them see me. How far? 25 feet down? Plus anything? Oh no! Oh, no way. You are slaughtering today. Frustrated DM. There's the make-up. There it is. What's it look like, being pushed around in a circle? The last one that remains un-asleep crossbow. Nice. Is he now within melee of him? 17, so I'll use my sneak attack. 12, that's an eight. 12, 16, 20! Yeah. Now, quiet-- I'm looking at you-- quietly kill the other, and leave one for questioning! Re-roll that. That'll do. Sucks the thumb. How do I get down? I'm tiny! Don't let me fall! Oh no. Oh, hey! 17! Trickster rogues, man, okay! Oh, that's not good. That's a six. Grab him! No! Question him! As one! SAM, DARIN, and You, strong people, grapple him! All together, right? One, two-- Not me. Nine. Oh my god. Are you serious? Give him pain. Pain. You said he works for the Bright Lord? Pig-skin! So Ur-Gram works for the Bright Lord and can bend anyone to his will? You lead us to Ur-Gram, we'll rest for a minute, and then when you lead us we'll let you leave! I'm going to bind his hands first, and then I'm going to stick some dirty garments hanging off of Eden in his mouth, to gag him up. Hold on. I take out the-- I should gag him back up. I walk back over to Eden and I tear off a bit of cloth near the groin area. Yeah, I put it back in. Okay, should we take a short rest? Because you have those hit dice once per day. Oh man, pet names. Pet names for our captive. You've got a gag in your mouth. Now hold on! Oh, why are you untying his hands? They're on his hands! Now, I've made him a nice bit of jewelry for his wrists. Let's leave it on so he feels like he's part of the group. Okay. I tie his hands back together. In front! Those were never tied. Do it. You are huge. Oh my gosh. Is that what the mark looks like? Can I make an insight check to see if he's lying? Natural 20. I've got an idea. What if we untie him and he brings us in as new recruits to Ur-Gram? We'll get an audience with him and we cut his head off! And then we bring it back. And we'll cut you in on the spoils. That's me, man! I actually have deception for once! Make him naked! Ferocious warriors, we are. Painfully. 17. Location, location, location. I hope. Are there trees around us? Yep, just thought I'd ask. You know, some ashen trees? You hear caragors? Prepare to fight! And I hide. That's true, we should. 16. Look and see if we can make it past them! You, stick your head out. Oh my god. Please throw it a mile. I could use Mage Hand to create a better distraction. Yeah. I think you were thinking it was like a dog. Really terrible. It's like a giant liger. Yeah, only four-legged. Greyhounds of death. 15. We don't forc around. Skak. Because it's laying prone, I probably can't see it from below, right? I'll aim to the other one that turned at the sound of pain, and I will use my crossbow to shoot at it. That's terrible. 12. (whimpers) Bonus action! Hide! Okay, fair enough. 18. On stealth. Get its attention, you can do it. All the dice come out. Just all the dice. Action surge. Wow. Double ones both times! Relentless damage! Do we see him under this giant caragor? I'm on my way! (panicked noises) Can I not help him at all? I pop back up out of hiding. Can I take aim with the crossbow again? As a bonus, can I smash a poison vial on one of my arrows to make it a poisoned arrow? I'll keep that in mind. Crossbow! Natural 20! Six. Is it sneak attack? Is he within melee of the other ones? Excellent. Oh god. 16. 24. 26. That one's supposed to be doubled too, right? Okay. 26. Oh, are you okay, Mozuu? Can you? Can we see if he's killing him or having a chat? Nope! Two! He's killing him. I nock an arrow. Oh shit. 25. That's terrible! Eight. Nine. 13. Heal him! Oh, you fixed him up? Oh! Or you can take that as a sign of things to come if you do it again! Prepare to feel the-- oh, not terrible! 20! Boy, don't you call me point making! All right. Inside. Wait. Should we make him look a little better? You almost killed him. What? I have a crowbar. Yeah! 17. So the doors lie ahead but I see off to the side a little quagmire. It's like mucky, muddier earth and liquid-- We could, yes, or we could see if perhaps there's a way under the wall. So we either go in through the front door-- (laughs) Oh yes, literally! Oh jeez! Oh gosh. (laughs) Okay. Yeah, it does. Shrak yeah! Okay, do we send him first? No, because if he gets in, he runs away. I'm just saying. Which one of us? Five total? 21. The guy walking towards the brazier? Yeah, but there are three longbows above us and we have the low ground. Okay. I eye the guy walking with the torch towards the brazier. Does he look like he intends to light said brazier? I will draw very quickly the crossbow and try and put one in while he's not looking. Rolling with sneak attack. But is it a sneak attack? 16 to hit. Okay. Ten, 15, 16, 17. (shouting) Go! That will miss! That misses as well! I'm going to try and hit him, one of the last two. Okay. 15. Oh, thank you. Then that is only-- it's only ten. Uncanny dodge, please. We should run to the front door and act like we saw attackers running off in a different direction. (laughs) Body chucking's not a thing? Are we going into the shrak hole? No. Yes, and I jump in. I jump in after him, in the shrak hole. Oh, I could barely make it through! So big. Hits. Uncanny dodge. No, I already used my reaction. Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap! 16 for me. Oh jeez. There's only 40 of them. 40 or 50. 16! (laughs) Yeah, it hits! Whoa, so can I use uncanny dodge on the slashing but not the radiant? So 13 points down to seven? (shrieks) Please! Let us live! Let us live! I want to be with you! And I will aim my crossbow over at Eden. (laughter) Is he within melee of one of my 40 or 50 of my new allies? 23. (laughs) Ah, shit! Seven. Oh! (laughter) (scared voice) Play along! Tell a joke! I can't use uncanny dodge-- Eight. I want to hide behind the gravewalker's legs! (laughter) Me? I was born this way. 13. This is the one to follow. Yes! Bright Lord! Not with that attitude! Well, technically, we are bad guys. I serve the Bright Master! Can I hold my attack and ask for one of the large uruks or uruk-hais to pick me up and throw me above the wall so I can take a crossbow shot at fleeing Eden? We all must serve, answer the call! Yeah, that's going to be a 19. 21. We cannot flee! Does he know what's coming? Any chance of sneak attack? He's on the other side of the wall. Yeah! 15, 17, 18. Not me, we're on the same team! Betrayers unite! Yeah. Crossbow. Oh! Does it up my-- if I'm from a hidden position? I will use my bonus action to try and hide. 27. Oh my god! Damn! Oh, that's pretty good. 25. 12 points of damage, and I will use fury of the small to add five extra damage to it, so 17. What happens? It's not fair. It's not fair! I can only do that once a day! Sorry! What? Yep. Dead. Can I try and resist the domination? That I'm under the hold? No. Then I will gladly take a-- can I jump down from the wall? No, crossbow. Is he within melee of anybody for sneak attack? All right. Crossbow right at him. With my bonus, can I try and hide? That's 26. How do I get advantage on the rolls? Sneak attack? Okay great, come on. Damn it! Okay, that's fine. 18. Aw. 12, 15, 20. Damn it! But the tip goes into your chin. Dang it, Eden! Just take it! Take the arrow! Throw it at the Bright Lord! Yes. That was fun! I want you to know that after that ended, I went up and shot Eden in his sleep. To rise through the ranks. My warchief ambitions. That shadow strike is real in the game, too. It's legit.
