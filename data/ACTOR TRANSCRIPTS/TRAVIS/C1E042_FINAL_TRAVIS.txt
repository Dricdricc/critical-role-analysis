Get the fuck out. I am the Vision. (laughter) Yes, I have Operation Supply Drop, which is a great charity service that delivers fun where there is none to soldiers that are in combat overseas. It delivers gaming systems, games, brings some much-needed levity to areas of high intensity and overall warrior badassmanship, and I'm very proud of that. She feels like she's got to "warm up" her endless army of dice. You have five d20s right now. No, not even there. That piece of shit. Where are the majority of the people? Are they in the dining hall and in the-- Sure we did. I was going to say, are there any new people that have come into the keep while we've been away? Can I ask one of our guards that? Nobody's sticking out to you, though, no shady individuals, nobody sweating more than is necessary when being threatened by a big fuck-off dragon? Jarett-- No. (laughter) Lauryn Hill is shaking her head. Pike's with us, though, right? She could do an insight check. We'll kill everyone. Kill everyone. I haven't. It is a virtue. What if they leave? What if they leave the city, or what if they turn us in to the dragon to save their own asses? Said the greedy one to the greedy one. Scanlan. What about you becoming a spy? So what you're saying is? Your shining moment-- All right. So we reach out to the Ashari. Or there's no one left to send. With what? Wait, what are we talking about dragons? Do other dragons hate dragons? Yeah, where are they? What? Can I object to checking the center of Emon, right? Because that's where the Cinder King is? Didn't it, like, ruin magic when we did it to the beholder, didn't it see us and laugh and we were like, augh, it hurts my brain-- I remember. Shit. Remember to shop at Gilmore's Ruined Rubble. (laughter) Oh. Well done. Well done. That was nice. And endless supply of pavers and gravel. All your home improvements. Shit the bed. Yeah. Do that first. Well, everybody's got to grow up at some point. Yeah, because they'll go through real fast. Can't we put them on a wagon? Can't we like put them on a wagon, down and like-- And the room goes silent, and the mug comes up. I walk in and start cracking my knuckles behind Vex. Yeah, think about it! One one thousand, one one thousand-- I hate to be the detail-oriented one about this whole thing, but should somebody be counting as soon as she starts so we put down an arm at six? You really don't want me to do that. (shouting) Move your fucking asses! 17. Peace! Inconvenience of it all. Ooh, that's true. Yeah! Like a dragon. Oh, please. Yeah, let's go! Yeah, they're probably nocturnal anyway. That means they're around at night. What? Yeah! What he said. Oh come on, we're never even-- we've not even walked in yet. What is it? Come on, giant blue nut ball dice. Natural 20! Natural 20. Hell hath frozen over. Could you determine if they're wyverns? 20. And how high is the roof? Look down the barrel! I'd like to hold my turn until it gets off the roof and maybe comes down to the ground. Yeah, we could always run, too. Or has a terrible cold. Right. Can I barrel down through the alley now that someone's on the ground, and race towards the one that's nearest Percy? I'll remember that going forward. Yeah. I would like-- and I would like to swing twice with Craven. Yes indeed. Plus-- That's 26. And a 14 on the second one. No, these are regular attacks. Yeah. Oh! No, I did not. I would like to rage. 12-- 22? Oh, wait. Yep, 22. Oh, that's right. 22, that's it. Yes! 22. Yes. It's Maverick and Goose! No, it was Merlin. Yeah. Tim Robbins. You don't want to do this with me. I don't remember him doing it. Yeah, I'm going to continue where I started on, shitfucker out in front of me. But I would like to go Great Weapon Master and I would like to use Reckless Attack. That's a 31. 25? I told you he'd open up to me! (laughter) I'll go ahead and take care of that wyvern that's next to me. Natural 20. 19-- oh, so the 2d6 was nine, plus five is-- Plus 11. Ten. Four. Four for those two, do I plus five to that as well for the-- Yes, 2d6 plus five on each one and the-- Yeah. Oh, yeah, and on Great Weapon Master on a crit or killing an extra hit, but I guess I--? (laughs) Just throw it? Don't throw it? I'm good, I'm good. Heh, you're dead. Hits. (snapping noise) Let me return that favor in a second. Oh shit. Come on, smart Grog. Oh! Yeah! I leave one of those to you guys, and I run at the two wyverns on the left. Yeah, against them both! Here's hoping these puppies go-- That's 24? Yeah. Can I swing at the other guy? Yeah, let's divvy it up, I don't want to give anybody too much love. Five, four, 26? 11, 22, 32? 32 on the first. Five, ten, 21, 31, 31. Do I have to roll for the hit? That's 31? Sorry! No, no, never mind, sorry, what's 31 minus five? LIAM and Okay. Three, seven, 12, 30. Oh, 22, 32. That's it. Hits. Well, I have resistance against poison, so that helps. Okay. All right. Ugh, 12. Aw! (laughter) (chuckles) Heh, math. Yeah. What for? I go grab the humanoid figures and I throw two over my shoulders and then I get one in each hand and I start dragging them toward a door? To an "any inside." Hey, search that shit, Vax. I would not like to take a short rest. I lose all my Fancy Feast if I do. Oh, yeah yeah yeah! Can she heal me instead? Hey, that's very handsome. Where's the extinguisher? Jesus, what the fuck are we doing here? Light. Aye. Is there any poo on the floor? What? Well, I'm all about Pandora and her box, but I don't think we really need this. It's not worth all of that. Especially if we're going to Vasselheim. You're still assuming he's going to keep his word, too. What? It should be Vax. Yeah! Attaboy. Yes. I wouldn't do that. A fellow can't smile every once in a while? I stay next to Vax. Vecna. (laughter) Kill her now! Vax, I think you made the right call, and I don't think very often. Yeah. Sometimes you have to walk away from a bad deal to find a good one. When it rains, the sun is shining. Stew on that. We could just kill them all now. I saw, like, 40 or 50. 29. The showroom is fucked. It's broken. Vasselheim. It's dead on. Yeah. I got to sleep. Oh. Okay. That's a lot of-- Yeah, Vasselheim. Dragons get hungry. I know who she's going to talk to. Shitting on your own bed? "Mind the poo." Vasselheim? No. No magic in the city. Yep. So, like, I really want to go talk to the Kung Fu Panda master. I don't think we're going to get a lot of fights in. The guy, I think he was the teacher of Kern. The guy I beat in the crucible. Yeah. No. Slayer's Take. Good to see him. Yeah! Yep. Trinket stays in Emon, right? Individuals? Yeah. I plan to go see Earthbreaker Groon. Old punchy man? You don't want to come with? No, I'm going to have a conversation. Some hand-to-hand? I'm not fighting him! We abandoned Greyskull Keep. I'm allergic to cats.
