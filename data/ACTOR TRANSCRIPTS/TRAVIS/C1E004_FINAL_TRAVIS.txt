Happy birthday, Nancy. Totally watching this right now. I don't think my mom knows what the internet is. Not thanks to some. We follow. Oh crap. Why? Why would he touch his dice? We're gonna die! I don't recall that. I'll stay outside the tent if somebody wants to ask him how to get a Magneto helmet like his. (all laugh) 'Cause I'm gonna need that. The first roll. Oh, Jesus. I would like a steel beanie as well. Weeks? I have a very large bronze pot in the bag of holding. Could I wear that on me noggin? (scoffs) She's rolled twice. Did he say his eyes, the flayer's eyes, are what put people in trances, or their minds? So if we wear helmets, it's not gonna help us. I'll still wear the big bronze pot on my head. On my whole head. No, but I'm protected from the flayer. I don't need it, I have incredible warrior skills. Shit. Jesus. Oh, God. Yeah, we're gonna put the beat down. (all laugh) No, you were invisible. Think. (all laugh) Oh ho, it echoes in the pot. (all laugh) But I start laughing to myself. (silly laughter) What's in the bottom of the crevasse? Can we pick up the little loch ness monster and throw it at him or something? We're gonna charge in there. I don't know if I can. Really? You just got back. None of us went in the water. The bottom of the crevasse, right? So we didn't go down there. We could go away from him for a second. We haven't been there yet. I don't think an onyx fortress. We didn't have him fly down there and get a close look. Why don't we send one, like Mars Rover over here, and have him go check it out? Isn't there something in the water? We haven't been down to the water's surface. But maybe there's a different vantage point. He might die, didn't say it was foolproof. Never to be forgotten. Tiberius. Tiberius. Do it. Go fly all the way down to the water's surface. Like Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future 2, and check out if there's any other tunnels that we haven't seen, or ways to go. We didn't go down to the water's surface though, did we? Oh, we did? We went all the way down? Can you freeze it? We have two underwater breathing potions. But remember, we're slow as balls in water. Can we stand on it? Anything, if we wanna fight it? Or are we gonna be fighting it in the water? Yeah, but we'll be slow. I'm not worried about that part of the question. Can you electrify the water and fry the guy? Don't a couple of you have Lightning? Can't you deep-fry the water? Blah blah blah. Hodie-fucking-ho. Why don't I have Lightning, I swear. Can't you fry the water first? See if it hurts it? Do that, please. 'Cause maybe there's a way-- there's a tunnel, and we come up behind them or whatever it was. What's the difference? Oh, shit. Oh man, Percy, Percy. Tiberius. Would you go fry the fucking lake? No, I want you to-- (metal clanging) While all this is going on! Vax could show his ass, that's a pretty white light. I thought if they could see you-- Do we have a plan? But I'm wearing that. Really? That I'm game with I'll be like a lighthouse, walking around. Crushing life. (all laugh) I like it, let's do it. I'm gonna read up on this Chopping Head spell. Yep, I'm read up. Nice job, Doogie. Rub it in. I'm sharpening my ax. It is good. The human torch was denied a bank loan. (all laugh) So, vocal warm ups. Fucking nipples. We get advantage on that, right? One. (all laugh) Yup! Aw. Thought we were gonna get a warm up. It's playtime. We don't need all of them, though. Just to cause further distraction, or to get some allies on the inside. They're probably ready to fight, like me. (all laugh) Clang clang. ASHLEY Clang clang clang clang. I hate chess. Or you can fly me. Why don't we turn my pot into a lighthouse, and then you fly me over, and I'll do like, abominable snow man walk. I like that part. Let's do it. Hands up if you're in. Do it. I would like to cast, um. (all laugh) Let's do it. What? We'll be like UFO's. Was that "I Saw The Sun"? Amazing, don't puke in the helmet though, that would be gross. (imitates puking) I can't see anything. Just a cauldron on my head. Great. I can't see, so you gotta tell me. I start flying the wrong way. It's one arm in and one forward. (all laugh) Plus ten? 27. Roll shake it, roll shake it, roll shake it. Get down there and wing it. You go! Yes. Yes! Who needs you to be invisible? You're a stealthy bastard. Why don't we land on the roof and we all lay flat, except for the people that are going in, and you cast Invisibility. Oh God. 23. Yeah, the two go inside, and if shit goes down, we light it up. Go find shit! Come on, Chip 'n' Dale. We're like, flat on the roof, right? Oh. (all laugh) Yes we get a map, finally! 'Course you are. Yep. Squeeze it together. Press the little button. I like how you guys have different-colored lightsabers. (lightsaber noises) Do it! Put it in him! Lean him up against the wall! Like he's standing there. Nope, nope, nope, nope. You guys have got seconds until that other guard comes back. Oh God, oh God. Oh God, over extended. And I rage. Rage. Didn't you give her an arrow? 62? I don't know what you're doing. 18. Ashley's first two rolls were 20s. Right, so we're on the roof of the thing, right? I'm in a rage, I take the pot still on my head, and I pick up my ax, and I draw one gigantic smash through the roof of the building. 15. Yeah. Is that a d12? Do I get advantage on that? Seven. Nine. 21. Yeah. 'Cause I'm so bright. That hits. That's cute. Three-dimensional fighting. Nice! 14. Shit, bite is at 24. Come on, Pike. We got our Davy Jones in the room, he'll take care of the dwarves. (groans) Kitty! I would like to go into a frenzied rage, and charge at Clifford the big red dog. (all alguH) All right, I have nine, eight, 17. Oh. Is it a 20 or is it a what? 17. 19. Yeah, that one hits, 16 plus eight. 14. 21. 21 again. 22. I don't wanna do math and show you all up. 3d10. Change of tone. (all laugh) Nice. This could be cool. Yes! Activity in the Breach. 26. 24. Yeah. It's like the start of a Pitbull song. How many hit points do you have? Let's not skimp on Scanlan. As you always do. What, what, in the butt. Preparation H? Fire damage to the anus. It's right in front of him! This thing sucks. One. What, me? Bah! How tall is the thing? Can I climb up on its back? I would like to run up to its right side and flank it. Yeah. (snarls) 21. Hits, right? 16 plus eight, hits. Natural 20! (all cheer) Oh, double damage, okay. 16? Yes. 21, thank you. Stay on the table. 20, thank you, and. 15, plus that, 20. Oh, double the second one. I would like to chop down into the fleshy bit, and after I've sliced-- Can I get to its mouth at all? I would like to swing through and catch the corner of its mouth, open its mouth wide, and then I'd like to reach in, and with my teeth, pull its fucking tongue out of its head, and start thrashing it side to side. (all laugh) What do you after you're biting its tongue in your mouth? That's a good point. Yeah, I'm gonna King Kong his jaw. I'm gonna take the broken part, the top of his head, and just pull apart. And as it falls, the tongue that's hanging in my mouth, I look to one of the dwarves that's left, I go, who's next? (all laugh) They did? You dicks! Chaotic neutral, bitches. This. Oh. I think it's a website called redbubble.com? I just googled Grog, and there was that. I needed it right away. Right, right. We're gonna have a website with all our characters. Matt, you're going to Wizard World in Philly. But we will not be joining because we don't own a private fucking plane. Oh really? Yeah, do it. There was a question, how much do you improvise, and when is it appropriate to improvise? The answer is yes. What? Oh. She was pissed. What? Oh. I asked what the biggest playable character was, I think. One that liked to fight, drink, and fight. It was so good. Yeah you did. Genius. That was decided by me, thank you. It worked. I keep seeing this one. For the 11 year old Sadie, the son of Odin shall have that cookie! A troll dick and a bulette tongue. It hasn't gone in that bag. No, Dork the ox. That's when we first learned its limitations. He did, he really did. Can Marisha do her dwarf impersonation? There's no air, it's like a vacuum. A magical vacuum. One giant dead ox came out of the bag. Yeah, we battle-tested them. The game before we came here. After they saved the kingdom of Eman, the sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III, as part of his gift to the group for essentially saving his family and the city itself, had a Keep constructed for them, and took about six months or so, and the Keep was finished, and then the party's first session was them finding who they're going to hire to take care of the Keep for them. Did we tell them about your podcast with the recording of the very first one? It's amazing. Computing. I do miss those Madonna songs. Yeah. If one of your characters died, would you roll a new character? Ignore it. The tears of three women in the room. It's just water in those tankards. Grog was easy, he makes bad decisions, which is just all that I do. I'm Morgan Freeman, and I rolled a one. You can see him swimming in the infinity of-- Grog and Vex. No, I'm here to annoy Vex by smacking her bear around, and she's here to tell me not to kill myself. "Don't jump into the crevasse, it's 1000 feet deep." Virgin sacrifice. Really? What if they die? Oh man, you are teaching life lessons. Go Fish and then D&D. Dragon Age race/class. Ash, anybody that plays? Always the mage. Oh (scoffs). Contractually, Thor, realistically, Hulk. I mean I am Thor, I can't say any other guy. Yeah let's just be real about that. That's Hulk. A million arms. I'd be Trinket. Why are you peeing on everything? Day one. She had that shit like that. She knew she wanted a pet bear. We put it jeopardy situations before. Alignment shift. My favorite kill wasn't even an enemy, it was when Scanlan summoned that pony, when we were facing those five wizards. (all laugh) Butchered a pony for intimidation. I think it was a natural. Mr. Reynolds. He'd have to play on a bearskin carpet. But, it was what? Yeah, dragonslayer. Scanlan's idea also. Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic. (all laugh) What's that? Oh, yeah. Brothers. Brotherhood. Brotherly love. Matt, who were you in Fate-0? Bless you. What's under the freakin' lake? Listen, there was a shitload of gold. Well, I did almost get us killed. You guys take care of this. That's tough. Lord of the Rings. That's the OG. That's right. Wilhelm, hand? Wilhand. Grog has an intelligence of six, he's gonna get names wrong from time to time. Marvel. Yeah. Right, not in New York. Anybody that lives in New York in the Marvel universe is just stupid. Like rent's gotta be $1.50. Did anyone tell Pike that Scanlan killed the naga for her? Trippings and beat-downs. Matt, you have a favorite voice? And does it hurt to do the gnarly monster voice? Breathing in and out. It is inward singing. What do we think is taking over the hive mind? Yeah, you had a vision that we don't even know about yet, right? Taking those mushrooms, having those visions. Yeah, we can't give it away. Greater overall motivations? A dead one. What? You don't know man, I went through the portal, handled my business like a champ. I don't kiss and tell. Nobody knows. I got what we were supposed to get. I flashed her the look, man. She was mine, what can I say? Grog and Scanlan have no bastard children, that we know of. Or that you can prove. No. Yes! I went unconscious once 'cause I fell, how far did I fall? I was ready to Toro the bull. I was gonna dodge and be all awesome, and say ole or some shit, but I was just out. It was pretty legit. A beholder? You know what that is too? What made the dwarves get bigger today in the battle? Long lost son. You can't get hair like this without unicorn blood. My God. It said do you ever think about sexuality while playing, besides Grog, of course. Scanlan does, I'm sure other people have. We just pay for it. Claymation, that's awesome, man. That's seven seconds at a time. Try? Matt is now a nymph. The very first time we played, I picked up Sam and chucked him across a room. That was full of a trap. And it worked. It was awesome. You do? Jarvis. (all laugh) You're a freak of nature, man. Just under 700. It's all muscle, bitch. Muscle and wang. 500 pounds and a hundred-pound wang. Best item in your inventory? Oh, did we already say that? I'm just blanking. My brain's turning into applesauce. How long does it usually take the woman in the back to tie her boot? What? Sounds like a horrifying idea. (air-horn sound) Yeah!
