Is there any nudity? That's debatable. Well, what is it? Only matters what we do next, right? What's this new spell you were talking about? What? Oh! (unhappy humming) Her fucking eye is still moving. Does it look reptilian? You're fine. What were you doing?! Was it telling you to pull your own fucking eye out? Ew. Where did it go? I come over and start helping him look. Okay. Hey, that's high! That's not. Three. Holy shit! It's an eyeball; it doesn't have ears. Oh yeah, she still goes in the bag, right? How do you do that? Percy, don't you know the Feywild? Do we see any structures off in the distance, or is it all just overgrowth? Yeah, I was going to say I have a terrible idea. I think they wanted to leave, so what if they know of some hidden treasure trove around here? That could, you know, tit for tit. Ooh, the bigger the animal, the bigger the diamonds? Surely they've cleaned all that up by now, right? Take a loan? Was it a bad idea? Yeah! If it burrows in the ground, it can't break out of the box, right? Less than five pounds? Do you want a pair of manacles? Here's a pair of manacles. Doe, a deer? A female deer? If we howl, right? Aw, buddy. If I had that, I'd be doing that all the time. Why are you dealing drugs? Just be like boop! And think how useful that will come in the bedroom. Manacles! Nobody? Cool. We don't need the mansion; I got all my hit points. I'm good. Aren't these trees dangerous in their own right? Okay. Did the bow talk to the trees or anything? Fenthras. You guys crash; I'll take first watch. What, me? Go. Why did you go so far away? Performing illicit acts. I'll take both. TALIESIN and I don't, boo. Yeah. I'm already exhausted. I frenzied last. We've all learned what happens when I get two points of exhaustion. Good things. Long, dark black hair? Pale? Oh, it's that slow? That's like Lance Armstrong sleeping slow. I'm not perceptive at all. Where did everybody go? What? I go down. Is this real? I need to pee. I was asleep, and now you're here. You need to work on your intimacy. (laughs) Oh fuck. Oh shit. Yeah. Thank you, New Vax. Yeah, it's not like we have no agency, right? We've been hit with bigger problems. We'll work this one until we can't, anymore. Yeah, me neither. If you wear clothes, is the deal null and void? I have to be naked. (laughter) Oh damn! Free Willy. That's so raven. Battling it the last two seconds. And your other equipment away. I think we should call out to the werewolves. We need diamonds. All last night, "we need diamonds." Huge discussion. Took forever. We should still call the werewolves. How often are you in the Feywild? It's like going to Philadelphia and not eating a cheesesteak. Oh, yeah. He was. I bet if we call the werewolves, he will show up, as well. I'll just howl for them real quick. True. (howls) Damn it! 13. I love Teen Wolf. I know every line in that fucking movie. Michael J. Fox. That doesn't exist, right? That's a very long discussion, but I meant actual location for them. Ooh! What about Kord? I'm wearing his oven mitts. Oh shit. Are we straight-up god recruiting? Is that what you mean? Do gods talk to each other? What do you mean? We need them with us, or they're going to imbue us-- That could be cool. No, you're taking it too-- relax a little. Do you want some ale? Who's your god going to be? Is there a god of mischief or song or cubes? (singing) Oh, moon weaver! Do we hold hands? Did any werewolves show up? Not a problem. Eight. I have to pee. I don't know. (laughter) This is weird for you, right? Is there still dust in your pocket? What's with your eye? What? (gasps) Oh, I don't have to pee. (laughter) It ain't close. It's eight hours. What deal? You wanna tell us what deal it was? Okay. Fucking A. I have a random thought. While y'all are trying to go get Sarenrae, this is where the story of the Lord of the Quad Roads is. If you're not familiar with the Lord of the Quad Roads, he was a gentleman that just very quickly came into fame and fortune, and he's a personal friend of mine, and I thought I might try and go find him for a favor. You know, one of those people if you pop in town, they get real pissed if you don't stop by. Maybe? Could be. Not sure. Yeah. I'll meet you up where we were. Yeah. It's real important. Yeah. I could just pop in, give him a little fist bump, and I'll meet you at Sarenrae's hovel. Fancy a trip? Yeah! Yep. You know, totally behaving ourselves. Besides, we'd know if Old Shit Nuts is moving closer because of-- Holy shit. (whispering) Tell no one All right, so I know this guy named the Lord of the Quad Roads. Back up. While you were gone-- were you gone? I'm not sure. Did you know that I have this little magical thing? No. Okay. (laughter) So I went to Vasselheim. Actually, I was looking for you, you little shitstack. And I was like, hey, I've got an idea! (explosion) Boom! In my head! I was like, I'm going to find a guy to pull out cards for me, see what happens! Well, I heard her nagging me in my head. Yeah. (laughter) No! Because fucking I made him pick it. So he goes, ooh! And all of a sudden, he was in fancy clothes and he had a servant that appeared in the alley! He was like, thanks! I guess I have two more of these! And he fucking ran off! No, he pulled the one card and it disappeared in his hand. Right? And then he walked off. But the point is he's got two more wishes! Yeah! And I told him, Grog! Grog gave you those! Remember me! I'm not opposed to it. I thought, maybe, if we walked in and I had a title like Grog the Wish Giver, and we were calling to check in on him, that maybe it's time to pay his tithe to the Wish Giver, and maybe he would give us one of the two. Yeah! Or pressure him. Lay it on thick. We could say like, "Your fucking face is going to "fall off if you don't give me one of your remaining wishes." Oh, I've still got them. Yes! Well. (haltingly) For peace on Exandria, right? I want to live forever! Just never die! I just want to him to go, you will never die. I'm happy. Aren't you really old, though? You get company. What would you wish for? I mean, enough of the bullshit. Yeah, I think maybe you can get real descriptive with it, too, so you can make it real complicated. Maybe think about it while we're on our way. Yeah! How about we go and we pressure him and then if he doesn't bite, then we kill him. I want to look like me. He's going to remember me. You're the idea man. Warm it up, son. Let's get the bad ones out of the way right now. Shake it off. Yeah! Or maybe my manservant. Can you make me look really amazing? But rich and Wish Giver-y. I want to look like a sultan. I have a great record with these guys. (high-pitched) Peter Frostbucket! I seek Lord of the Quad Roads! I don't need it! Negative one! (laughter) Two and a one. Oh, yeah, sorry. Aside from the four around us, is anyone around? This is profiling. Thank you. I mean, mine's do one thing. You've got options. I just want to go talk to the Lord of the Crossroads! Manipulate that guy that recognized us. He said, it looks like it's him. Kind of blanched complexion, orange hair? Hits people in the face? Somewhere around here. You know, the thing about that one, though, he doesn't like to leave loose ends. Goddamn it! 13! No. I stay with my dice. This other one? Very tall and metallic-looking. Yep. We did! I was not really aware at the time. Yeah! Well, now that you mention it, I felt a chill! Oh no, his final change is complete! No, it's much worse! I trip and fall. Please, save yourselves! Run! I'm going to kill him. I reach up and snap the horn. It's a 20. (laughter) Well, you got us. Yep. Yeah. Sure, yeah. Lock me up first. (whack) (laughter) I don't think that far ahead. 26. Ten. Got to go. I'll get smarter. Sure. I should have killed him back at the shop. I'm pretty sure this problem wouldn't have existed. I have 13 left? (squawks) 16. Thank you. Only one, apparently. That is what happens when you leave things alive. Look, should we still look for the Lord of the Quad Roads? Which ship? All right. Temple of Sarenrae? Where is that? Should I wear the hat, since I am apparently a wanted person now? Can you do that? Aces. Damn it. Thanks, Vex. You know, he was "indiposed." We should go. Nope! I can't really look like me in this city right now. I punched a captain of the guard. Was it that long? Look how far I've come! I was just trying to go see a man about a wish. The trouble just comes to us. I forgot that Doty knocked out the guards, so I should have been like, oh, we rescued you from this horror. I didn't actually do anything because they were unconscious. Again, got to kill them all. I think we've all learned a valuable lesson. He might have already used them. (singing) One day more.
