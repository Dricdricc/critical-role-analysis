Oh shit! Wade the waters. Yeah, there's a lesser part of Dallas, totally, over with the lesser-- are you guys throwing up because of how nervous you are? I'll go find them, I'll go find them. There's literally up-chuck going to happen. Just do it in a little thing and I'll feed it back to you like a little bird I'll talk about our sponsor this week. Our amazing sponsor this week is Backblaze. Backblaze is an amazing, unlimited cloud backup company for your Mac and PC, for just five dollars a month, it's incredible. We have an amazing representative from Backblaze in the studio. He's a crazy, crazy uber-fan. Yev, wave to me baby, blow me a kiss. He's incredible. Yes! We're on you, we're talking about Backblaze right now. How many days, Sam? Pike's got us covered. Right, Pike? You got a little something on your-- You might need to go the bathroom, check it out. That's when they knew they fucked up. (laughter) I'm ready. Come on, lucky dice. I get advantage on that. 13 also. Maybe I go first, just in case something-- The Bramblewood? I'm holding on, right? With the Titanstone Knuckles. Whereabouts is the axe lodged? Can I see where the chain is attached to? (laughs) That went one and then a 13. Minus-- zero. 13. How high am I? A long way. Well. Only one way to go. And that's up. I would like to try and pull myself up the chain towards Umbrasyl. Athletics or strength? Oh! I get an advantage or? Oh, 14 plus five-- 19. Yeah, okay! I remember him saying that years ago! Do it, baby. Don't see me! Don't see me! I do? I have Danger Sense. So just one roll? That's not great. 11. Nice. It went away? I look down and I see my beautiful body tattoos melting away like instant oatmeal. Not even like the nice apples and cinnamon kind, it's like the maple brown sugar that no one-- Nobody likes that; you're alone in this. And it makes me so angry that I go into a rage? Right, yeah. All right. So I go in a rage, and I would like to try and continue climbing up the remainder of the distance to Umbrasyl. That was a one. That's much better. That's a 29. Mother of dragons! Do I have any more movement? I'm going to dislodge it, because it was already so weak. That's a one. Yep. Yeah. Which I have advantage on. 18. (laughing) On his back. Shit! That's good! Do it again. I'm enlarged. I had one question. I drank that Potion of Speed. It hastes me for a minute. How many rounds is a minute? Well, there's nothing to do but to climb back up the chain! Up the chain! Fucking weiner snap. 15. Might as well say something cool. I can do this all day! I'm really not confident. (screaming) Scanlan! (screaming) What the fuck?! It's the fastest model yet! I love Harry Potter. I have advantage on those. 26. I take out a case of fancy wine and-- (laughter) There ain't much else to do. Could I add one bonus thing at the end of mine? Can I see Scanlan and Bigby's Hand at all? Or is the world just a clusterfuck? Four. Remember, we're going to be going the same direction. I'm higher. I've seen Percy make shit, I can do it, too! (blows puffs of air) Look what you did! What. What?! (screams) It's a new day, baby. (caw) Can I see that flurry of black feathers streaking downwards of this guy? We're going full Point Break terminal velocity, straight down towards Vax. Maybe in my dive position I could squeeze your legs with my wings, how about that? I would. I would also think, what idiot was just flying behind the back of this dragon on a chain? What a fool. Unless I hear otherwise, I'm making a controlled descent towards the ground. Do I recognize Shale? Shale. (caw) Thank you, god. Shale. Yeah, it's me. I know, you can't tell. It's a beard. Yeah. Lots of lifting. Lots of running, getting strong. Oh. No, when I was born, she means. When I was born. Puny compared to mountains and stuff. It's a lot of fun, actually. We put a good hurting on it, yeah. Do you-- I mean, not like I'm questioning what can you do, because I don't think it's very much. Sweet. So you had to have been a part of this party for a reason. What's in your bag of tricks? What can you do? With your stick. Does magic come out of your stick? Oh, well, that's good. Is it a magical staff of dragon killing? I like that. But it will all be worth it if we can remove the head of this shitty black dragon. So, how far would you think that we are from his lair? Look, I'm a little jacked up. I think those two are a little jacked up. It's fair to assume that he will do the same thing, yeah? Go brush his teeth, have a deuce, all that stuff. Can we travel a mile up a mountain quickly? Can I just say that we agree that the reason we didn't do what Zanror wanted and go to the lair is because it's a fucking death trap? But he's going to heal up by the time we get there. Pretty good. In its lair? When I turned into the eagle, what happened to the Bloodaxe and chain? Yeah. That's nifty. We're fighting a dragon in its lair! In the worst place we could possibly fight it! That's because he's a liar and a bringer of death, and he is smiling at you while he does it. In your tiny voice. I've rolled all nine of my hit dice. Yes. 16. I'll put soot on your face if you come near me with that wicked, wicked staff of yours. What?! How could you have a staff and not give it a name? No. Really? Pike killed a dragon. Let's do it. (laughter) Wait, just to be clear if we kill the dragon, are you going to say you killed the dragon or would you say I killed the dragon? Who's going to be the greatest goliath? Yeah? We'll shake on it? Is there anything you can do to make the dragon visible with his invisibility? Set fire, or your faeries? Totally meant to. Okay. I'm just climbing. I'll follow them. 26. Nobody saw anything. You're a champ. Call me up to the front. We got this. (whispers) What about putting her on my back? Balls of shit. A mere 16. And the dagger disappeared into something, right? I take the tiny Pike backpack, and I would like to run along the right, the farther wall from you. Opposite direction. Yes. 50 feet, using diagonals to try and get as far around that pool as I can. Yep. And I'll use my bonus action to go into a rage. Hey Pike, gimme a slap! (growls) Nope. Well, I can't really hit him from here. 23. I would like to run along the side of the pool, and up on his left side, closest to the entrance of the cave. Right there would be delicious. I would like to go into a frenzied rage. A regular strike on the first. Yeah, not reckless. Not great weapon. I keep rolling, yeah? 24. Is the roll and then, what? Double it or add another--? That was a 15. Oh, the dice roll? 12. Yeah. Yeah. So that's an 11 for the second d12. Plus five for the necrotic-- Five. It's a ten. Yeah. 20. You nasty, boy! 27. I do. Let's do it great weapon master, just for kicks. 26 minus five is 21. Cool. Good beans. 23. 20. 25. Plus the necrotic. Atta girl, Shale! It was only 12 points of damage. I would like to stride over to Bigby's Hand, and can I take out a level-- It's not level two, what do you call it? Not superior, but the middle one. Can I take a moderate healing potion? Can I take the greater healing potion and chuck it to Percy? Just a toss while standing at Bigby's Hand? And I will hold my attack. I want to stay right by Bigby's Hand. I'll hold my attack until Bigby's Hand twitches. Please. Yeah. Can I make two reckless attacks? Yes, reckless. I'll use the inspiration die. That's a ten, so that's a 29. 23. 26. 24. 24. Thank you. 29. I'm not used to that. Ain't you pretty? Have you and Wheaton ever touched? Dragon does not seem to be--? That dumb grin. 18. I'm good. I have a question. Because he attacked me, do I get my retaliation attack on him? It's not reckless? The first one was an 18. It's a 27, so. That was a 27 for the first one. 18. Thank you. 22. Did the fucking necrotic do it? (screaming) I rear back with the bloodaxe and I swing for the hinge right where his upper and lower jaw meet, and I'd like to cleave up under his skull into his brain. Night saved. Monstah! No, Shale. Yeah. The wielder of the magic stick of nose-whappiness. I will wear this with honor. With the necklace? Oh, snap! I thought it was bullshit, but it's not! Dope! You want to rage loot? Plus it would be nice to give Shale some gold to take back to the Herd. Shale. There was a great remnant. The Herd will live again, and with Shale's wisdom. Zanror's baby mama is still preggo. Keyleth, you're going to butcher this dragon, right? Son of a bitch! Holy shit. It's amazing!
