What were the words you just used? There's hope. I am ready, my body is ready. Even in love, we are close. Wait, in game. In love? Fuck it. Are you? Is it strength-based? Oh. That's not bad. 16 does not hit? 16 does not hit. Did you hear that? It's very important. 16 does not hit. Neat trick. Yeah, darkvision in that is still blind if you go in there, right? Oh, fuck. We're going to. The Crick is right between these two? Beauregard and Molly? He’s covered in hooked armor and running at us aggressively. Can I look and say Everyone stay here. I'm going to see how far this darkness goes. I'm going to double dash and run down 60 feet in that direction, hopefully not running into anybody. I'll stop if I come into the light. That’s okay. Pray tell, it doth hit. That's okay, I've got the armor on. I've got that armor, boo. That's all right, he's going to take it. Oh shit, all ten? He does take ten ice damage back, yeah. Oh, for a bonus action, can I make a perception check to see if there's anybody on the other side of the tunnel? 13. Can I about-face and wait on the other side of this? You caught a big one! I will when it's my turn. Wooshed! Does Molly do birthday parties for kids? Non-lethal damage! Can I-- Can I run up behind the assassin and, using the blunt end of the falchion, the non-edged side, can I try and strike non-lethal damage into the back of his head? Do I get advantage because he's bound? Grappled? Okay. Barnacle blow. 18 plus-- All right, now, non-lethal-- That is 12 points of damage. Yes, it does. He's not hurt enough, apparently. What about the one? 12. Did you hear that important detail about the enemy that he just revealed? Pretty sizable incisors, sharp fucking teeth. Nonlethal! That hits. Nonlethal. That's only a 14, no, 15. Ooh. That's a dope feature, whatever that is. Hey! That is some white elephant gift shit, right there. I start patting the body down. Molly help me. I got 50 feet of hempen rope. Maybe no bows. Yes, yes I am. Sword, sheath, black boots, yup. Got it. All right, so we get him nice and tied up, right? Yeah, sword, sheath, three daggers, pair of black boots that look cool, 116 platinum and 12 gold. Oh wow. (singing) Might as well jump. Jump! (laughter) Okay. Yeah that's fair. If we turn him in, it’ll take attention off of us in case we have trouble getting out of the sewer. But maybe we need to know who this is. True, good point. At least one basic truth. Is that right? Sure, if you want to. Unless you have any questions. Yeah, go keep watch. Plus? Nein! Just wang out. Please. Roll low, roll low! Yeah! You Jerry Maguire motherfucker. Help me, help you. I've got one job on this ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to do it! (laughter) Where are you trying to get to? You want to let him go, don't you? Yeah, tell us. We'll let you go. Ulog? Checking his face for reactions to any of them. Can I help her? 15? Yeah, I feel like we've kept him up long enough. We don't have to get him out, we just have to give him the chance to get out. I think we should do that. He's given us everything. We removed his armor. We should give him something to leave in so he's not just walking buck through the city. No, he just said he's going to kill us if we don't give it to him. Really? Why don't we leave it up to him? We untie him, he comes at us bros, we take him down. We're giving him a chance at freedom. He doesn't get the beacon. He'll come after it. I know. Yeah, let's do that. No? Can anybody else concentrate on it? Agreed. I won't speak for anybody in the group, but I'm not taking his life. So, if someone feels motivated, I'll just walk over this way. And I start walking back the way we came. Well, I don't know what it is. And if you're not going to look, what use do we have for it? And what do we do with him? And it would endear us to the city. I'm good either way. Leylas Krynn? Fair call. I'm all right. (whispering dramatically) Yes, he's going to take it. Unless you really want to. Huh? Do you? Do you? Open the door. (singing) Take a look... LAURA & We're giving him everything but the black boots, the sword and the sheath and his money. Yeah, we gave him the armor. Yeah. Not the boots, not the sword, not the gold. Yeah? We should get back to the Song and Supper Inn. Song and Supper. See if Dolan’s there. We are short one, you know. End it? Yeah, Ulog. Oh. Yeah. Well, in the fray of the Richter coming in, he lunged at her and put a little gem in her mouth. They exploded. We've got to get out of here. Yeah, we retreat. Back the way we came. Be quiet, we're being followed. Are you drunk, Nott? We should stop by the Song & Supper Inn, see if we see a friendly face. Yeah. I don't know if you saw, but his eyes and his nostrils flared when we mentioned Ulog. I have a feeling our small dwarf friend was involved in quite a bit more than we were aware of. Yeah. Yeah, down in the basement when we were talking. We didn't get it yet. Even more reason to find Dolan. It was part of the pot, yeah. How many gold is a platinum? MARISHA and Damn! I am. 13. Oh my god, we're going to try and get it now? We had it in our hands! What is the matter with you? Yeah, just full, "Ah." Does that make it drop? (stabbing sound) Molly and I are running after Caleb, since we saw the other guard. Nein! Sorry. Molly and I are trucking after where Caleb just went through. A lead box? Let's split the party. It's always the best idea. No, but seriously, we don't need everyone for both. Yeah, how about Beau and I will go to the Song & Supper Inn and we'll meet you at the Leaky Tap. Song & Supper. Nobody here. Sure feels like it, doesn't it? Not that we're looking for them, we're-- I don't feel very well and I don't have money for a proper physician. I'm sure we could find someone else. Yeah. Have a good night. Yeah. Want to check his house? You feeling that double? Oh good. That's good. I just-- Damn, that was impressive. Yeah. Beast mode? You want to go by Dolan's house? And a 16. Yeah. Well, I'll go up and knock. You want to go around back? Yeah. I knock and say, it's Fjord with the Mighty Nein, open up! Yeah. It's all right. Take a breath. Is there a back door to this place? Beau's going to be coming around the back, make sure she gets let in. You're leaving? Why? Take a deep breath, friend. Listen, Ulog is dead. He sacrificed himself in a very brave moment. He threw himself at the Richter, threw a gem in her mouth, and exploded in a Fireball. Listen, I think-- I think-- I don't think any of this leads back to us. We still have to complete our mission. We got to make sure that Lord Sutan is implicated in this, but right now we're clean. The Richter's gone! You have a chance to ascend to her seat! Wasn't that the plan? Stop. Don't be a coward in this moment. If you want to help this city, if you want to help make the empire better, you're going to have to stand strong. A little risk is going to come with this job, especially in that position. You knew the risk going into this, didn't you? To put your money and your lives at risk? 15. I understand. Fortunately, in this situation, you don't have much to lie about. You were here. You weren't at the Richter’s. You weren't involved in it in any way. The Knights of Requital are going to take the fall for this, that would be the only tie-in. Ulog is dead. You have a chance to do some real good here. We'll keep an eye out. I promise. If anything needs to be shared between, you can rely on us to pass a message. Are you in the house yet? That's Beau. You love him or you hate him. Dolan, I know Horris and you both are worried. We're still going to need that payment. Our efforts have incurred some damages. Anywhere you prefer? Is there a hiding spot? Fair enough. We can do that. Beau has experience with this area. I'm afraid Ulog may have had a larger game to play. Why do you say that, Horris? He left us in charge of finding justice for his wife, and we intend to. Do I believe him? 11. All right. Let's help Horris get out of the city. Stay low. Stay here. Have a drink. It’ll help with that. Of course. We'll have to regroup, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. We leave. "Do I get anything from it?" You creepy bastard. We got a quesadilla. Shady motherfuckers. That cuteness, man. Who are that? Not downstairs? Convene in the girls' room. It's bound to be cleaner. Yeah, where is Caleb? He's down there babysitting our item? Okay. What?! Spinach. That's my bad. Yeah, he did. Yeah, we forgot to qualify that. Yeah, jeez, man. No sense of humor right now, he's in shock, all right? Horris, we're going to get you out of the city as soon as possible. Is there a destination you wanted to send him to, or point him in the right direction? Have any spots in mind that you can lay low for a while? They were understandably rattled. It's understandable, but Dolan's going to try and stay to make the city a better place. Horris is going to remove a bit of the risk for himself for a bit. It is lovely by the coast. I think what Beau is trying to say is that you've made a wise choice in removing yourself for a bit. Did you happen to know the owner of The Leaky Tap? She's apparently selling it. She's selling it? Yeah. Did you want to get out of town tonight, or did you want to wait until the morning, perhaps? Not at all. We have room in Molly and I's room. Yeah, I'll lead Horris to our room and let him get comfortable. I'll be back. (gravelly) Red rum. Yeah, you're going down there. Wow, fucking pay day! What kind of sword is it? Does it look like it has any magical aura emanating from it? Not officially. Cay-Cay, not to be confused with Kiki. What do those do? Molly, put those boots on. You get an extra spring in your step? What's it do? Window-seal? Window-seal. Why are y'all staying in another place tonight? Oh. Because of the thing? You need any help? Backup? Right. Nott, why? Why are you going to-- Yeah, to be honest, that evening started to take a turn before the Richter showed up. Do you know Caleb to be sticky-fingered like yourself? Well, remember we were trying to leave no trace? Caleb was the architect of the plan, and there was a scroll that looked like it might have some magic to it, and he wanted to take it with. We were right there at the end, we were at the finish line. Nott, it's just a little reckless, wouldn't you say? We're looking out for you, I mean. You know, Nott, you count on Caleb to keep you safe, right, to achieve greater things than you by yourself can achieve. Think how many things you could do with all of us by your side. I'm not saying you don't have to be selfish, and I'm not saying that you can't go after treasure and coin. Okay. If I may, thank you for sharing that, Nott. That changes things. I admit that I had the wrong idea about you two. I know what it's like to feel responsible for someone. Nott, we want to take care of Caleb, we do. We pulled him out of that house when that Fireball went off. We didn't cut and run, even though it might have saved our skins. We care about you two. I hope in time you'll learn to trust us just a little bit more. Maybe think about protecting us as well, because you seem to do a great job taking care of Caleb. I appreciate that. So when are you planning to go down to keep an eye on your boy? Nott, how about you take those items to Caleb and call it a vote of confidence. I think he's got the point. Are you fucking serious? Natural one! I'm just eating bar popcorn. Yeah! What the fuck? Nope, you're not there. Yes! Just wait. Pick up and walk. I have to say it because Taliesin said it (whispers) Don't die. Oh, okay. A d8, right? Seven. Yeah, really, con modifier? I just forget. 11 points. I'm going to see Horris. Horris, do you need an escort out of town, or do you think you can find your way? Of course. Have much coin do you have on you? Oh, you'll be fine. Molly? Molly! Wake up. I think I'm going to escort Horris out. Be back as fast as I can. All right. Stay casual, stay calm, just turn and we're going to slowly start walking back. Just act normal. There always is. And if all else fails, there's the sewers. You're not opposed to getting a little dirty to get out of town, are you? We'll want to wait until we have more of the others, just in case. I'm afraid the sewers might be being cased as well, so stay put for a little while longer, we'll find you a quiet spot in the Leaky Tap, but let me check with the others. No, we found Dolan last night. He's going to stay put in his house, low. We're going to try and assure that he's safe so that he can, you know, put his name up for that High-Richter seat. But listen, the gates, it's not a joke, it's sealed. There are crownsguard swarming all over it. It seemed like they were doing personal interviews, pat-downs, the whole smash, so even an enchantment might not hold up to scrutiny. We didn't see her last night. She wasn't at Dolan's. Well, she saw-- Yes, she did. Yeah. Perhaps. Indeed. I was thinking that we might try and get Horris out now. That way, if a crownsguard finds its way here-- maybe we should take him into the sewers, get him out of the city. I imagine. Indeed. I did, too. SAM. And also there's the Gentleman, and also we need a lead box. Oh my God, there's so much to do! Horris, we obviously have a lot to decide on. Perhaps it would be better if you stayed up in the room. “Very sweet person.” Level four, let's go! (laughter) (computer voice) You are leaving the combat area. Chat's like, "Fucking idiots." The Leaky Nip. What's it called? Pumat's got to have a-- Have we been there yet? I rolled a natural 20. I know magic some! Not enough, DM says. Have you not been to the Invulnerable Gentleclerk? (belches loudly) (laughter) To be fair, he did say that. Pumat, or the rest of the equipment? Let’s do it. He’s pretty nice. He seems like a nice guy. Plus, we’re returning customers. Attacking us? I think if you give him a chance, he'll do you right. Pumat, we'd like to introduce you to one of our friends. This is Beau. Pumat, we came into a little extra coin recently and this is our favorite place to spend. You don’t happen to have any articles of protection, do you? A necklace, a bracelet, a ring? It was expensive, right? That sounds fine. Here’s ten platinum. Well, should we go? Oh, we're looking up something. Forgive me, I couldn't help but wonder. Have you ever had a chance-- Pumat Prime, rather-- have you had a chance to exercise your arcane abilities? Yeah, if you wouldn't mind. These are all-- What's the correct term? They're all copies of this fine gentleman. Pumat, I wanted to ask, we're such fans of your store, did you ever find call to, I don't know, use your magic for combat? What led you to a store like this? That's great. How many years have you had this store? Congratulations. It's really a thing. Shake it out of the corners of the giant flask. Thanks for your time, Pumat! He's actually still here. I would like it. Let's get that thing in its box. Are you fucking kidding me? Oh my god! Bestseller or used book? Pumat, thanks for your time. We will not be bothering you any longer. We double dash back to the Tap. No. Why? 22. Plus four. Yeah, I say that. It seems like a different sort of arcana than the type that I've seen. What else we got? That's pretty dope. Pretty dope. Although that greatsword she has is mighty fine. Yeah, certainly. I just have a preference with mine. I'm just real comfortable with it. You know when you get a feel for something, you don't want to change it up too much. Big-ass tall Doc Martens. My initiative bonus is zero, just saying. (exaggerated cough) No, you keep them. (whispering) Just smile and say, "Thank you, Nott." (whispering) Very good. So we should-- ugh, just look at them! We should probably do something. We still have to wrap up this deception of ours. You sound like The General car insurance. Yeah. I think that's right, actually. I forgot that part. Did we plant something in Lord Sutan's house, are they going to find the letter from-- We did. I don't know if he would report a robbery if he had a Rug of Attacking and you triggered it. We could certainly go by. Oh, shit, I forgot. That's right. We got paid already. How much did I get paid? Because it was minus Kara's. I did. Mm-hmm. I don't know if they'll send anything back on Dolan, but we should find a way to get crownsguard into Lord Sutan's place. We can't have Dolan rat on him. Hmm. Let's try that. Yeah. Let's try that. Yeah, we fucking follow him into the room! Yep. MARISHA and (shouting) Insight check! Insight check on Taliesin! Insight check! Look at Taliesin right now. Just look at him. I didn't say anything!
