Are those arrows green? Old Man Logan! X-O Manowar! I don't know, man. I like football. They make pharmaceuticals for that. Fucking dingleberry. He is now. Fuck yeah. (all laugh) Did you eat already? Too bad, no. Someone should teach him the Vox Machina fight song, then. Yeah. Do you know the fight song? You made up songs, then? No, that's good. Each one of these songs is, like, personal, to the member, right? So you make up a song about what Vox Machina means to you. Yeah. We'll need it by sundown tomorrow. We made him a snack! He turned into a Hot Pocket, y'all! Really? We're just eating breakfast. Go for it! Have we figured out how to project this on a 55-inch flat wall monitor for us yet? He's a Jolly Rancher in the belly of Craven Edge! I am a powerful magician. Yeah, he's on the farm! He's running through the fields of the farm, happy as can be. All the room to run he wants! (laughs) I mean, yes. This is very dark, dark time. Zero focus. Nothing. No. How's your keep bandwidth right now? Is your plate full? Are you going to audition these new guards like we did you? I like her. Yep. Doesn't say too much. Because she fought well! She fought a giant fucking scorpion in the courtyard. What are we doing today? What? (laughs) You're going to get crowned? Really? Wow! Does it sit on your head, or on the antlers? Why? Do all people with titles have to dress up? Are you sure? You know what? Breakfast is disagreeing with me. I think I have to go back to bed. (gags) Yeah, I don't feel well. I've got to go. I go back up to my room. Battle kilt. It's like Wisconsin. Boulder, baby. You don't just have some health potions in your armor? You can't just plink one out of your nutsack or something? What?! That's great! Man! We should tear you apart limb from limb and see what fucking shakes out! Another robe? Wow. He's a giant automaton! Yeah, yeah, do that! He's only got the one pair now. Really? You don't know?! (all laugh) This could be the dumbest-- Say the thing, say the incantation! I mean, I can make a gallon of it. Do you mean the fu man, or did you give him the full goatee? Because you just did the fu manchu. (keyboard sounds) Yeah. TALIESIN, LIAM, and (animatronic sounds) And I'll come down. Is that General Krieg? (screams) (all laugh) Why have you aligned yourself with this creature? No. Dootie did not have fire crotch hair. He did not have a face or hands-- --or a cloak. He didn't have any of that stuff. Oh, he's wearing a disguise! Yes. Who did that? As a team? Right. Wow. Could you do that to me? Wow. For nothing. Yeah, let's go. It's the elvish half. The waypoint. Ugh, god, the options both suck. (all laugh) No, no no. Okay, wait. Books? Nope. What are you doing? No. I'm doing my own thing. Oh, I will. I like that twin. Yeah, Jesus. (laughs) Holy shit. Oh, you're parked over here, too? Oh, okay, cool. The sphinx's name. The sphinx's name. Necrom√©? Turd burgers. Shade. Dark shade. And I'm the one with the low intelligence. "I'm the new guy." I thought you said you were taking the book to go look at the wherever. Fuck this. It's just that dismount at the end. Where we found you? Dispater? Which book? All right. Are you accustomed to buying things? Oh. Do you have a personal shopper? Nice. Well, show me how it's done. Yeah, I'm a bit big so I don't know how you're going to do that. Wow. That was amazing. Have you ever lied to anybody before? It was a thrill, right? Yeah. On a scale from one to two, how do you think it went? Nice, yeah. (moans in pain) I'm a leper. Yeah, good. Are they following us now? Still think it went well? Really? You know, it was probably you told such a good story, they're just fascinated by you now. You should probably act casual. Or you could drop some money on the ground, and let all the people run and collect it, and make a diversion. It's up to you. Just dump all your money on the ground. They'll come out of the houses, the woodworks. How long is his long, blonde hair? Just free-flowing? No fancy braids or buns or anything? You're talking real loud. No. They don't. Volume control, real important. Yep. How are we going to stay here and find the health potions at the same time? No, you're really doing well. I'm learning a lot right now. Clearly, you are a well-traveled man of mystery. I literally told you about that one minute ago. 15. Look, I hate to interrupt, right. Do you think you've done anything wrong? Yeah. Have you done anything wrong? You've never been here before? Yeah, it's totally fine. Look, this place is where the goods are. All sorts of stuff. I don't even know if his inventory has improved since we've last been here, but he will give you a really great deal, and it'll give you a chance to prove to me how good of a salesman you are. What? I mean, the motherfucking pig-latin. Jesus. I don't think there's any shaking them, right. Why don't you leave old twinkle-toes outside, and we go in? Surely Doty can read or something? Mute. What's wrong with that? Maybe just tell him to be cool. Yeah. No, no. She's not here. It's just me and my new, rich friend. Rich. Natural 20. That's what it says. She's not here. It's just the two of us. Do you see what he is covered in? Nice. Slick. Inside the shop, has it grown or become more ornate since we've last been here? Yeah. (laughs) You first. Not that that's not really impressive. You have to read the scroll, right? 4,400. Wow! Check'n'mate? Wow. Do you have anything that makes you faster? No. I'm pretty good at jumping. What about regular healing potions? No new exotics came in? Do you want to get them? It seems like you got all the money in the world. No, not-- well they do, they touch you with their hand and then like all of a sudden it feels a bit better. Yeah. I don't really know how that works. Yeah, I'm normally pouring them in their mouths. I don't know, I hadn't thought that far. As a (mumbling) new member of Vox Machina-- Bad allergies here. It could be like a really great gift, you know? Like Keyleth gave you. Yeah. Yeah, the brains. Let me confer with my partner. (whispers) How many on your hands is that? Yeah, no-- both hands, how many? Two? Too much. How about 9,000 gold pieces? Done! Pay the man. Tary, this man drives a really well-known establishment. If we leave here, after having struck that bargain, and we don't pay? There will be more guards outside. Tary, that was a personal gift from me to you. I suppose I am a bit proud. What? Oh Jesus. What did you do? Give me those! I punch them both, one time each, in the jaw, just for extra measure. Your guy really did a number. Cool. Okay. (all laugh) Yeah, he's got to die. Is there a counter in the shop? Is it wooden? Can he see through the counter? Well, what's in the shop? Is there a tapestry, is there a rug? Uh-huh. Yeah. Two. I saw this in a tavern once. Let's sit them up like they're just sleeping and nobody will notice. Well, didn't you put a mask on Dotty? Let's do it again. No, it will be no problem. I sit one up in the corner, and I sit the other one, and lean it on his shoulder. This is great. Don't worry. I have an even better idea! I take the cask of ale out of the bag of holding, and I just start pouring ale all over them. They're terrible guards. They make horrible life choices. They're in the wrong line of work. I take two chalices and I throw it in their laps. Cool. Now I need you to vomit on them. Do it right now. Put your finger down your throat and puke on these guards. 17! Puke on those fucking guards! Vomit on those bitches. I'm really sorry. These two gentlemen obviously have been off their ass. They came in here, smelling of booze, looking for something to make them feel better, I don't know, and they just passed out in the corner. Is there someone you know that we can call? I really hate just leaving them here. Nine. For the rest of the day? Obviously, we've gotten the better end of this deal. Do you still have the-- We should go. We should leave. Bidet. Good job. We've got to go. We've got to hole up somewhere for a minute. You know. A drink? Yeah. Is there a tavern near this shop? Where was that? What the fuck? You can't perform on command? I needed you. Okay, you got more in there? It's just a one-er? Okay. Okay. That looks like Lucky Charms. Yep. They're kind of rare. To Grog, they're rare. Pittsburgh. Wow. Can we hear them? Yes? Funny, we are doing something similar. Are you done? Yeah, they are. All right. The two fucking people talking to-- Yep. Yeah. My real-world ADD is fully maxed out. (all laugh) I reach over, I cover Tary's mouth. Percy? Let me know when you're done. All right. What tavern are you in? You can do that? Oh my god, I heard it. My powers are getting stronger. All right. We'll make our way over to you. Are you asking me to buy potions, Percy? But I thought you just sent me a request for-- All right, we'll have to fine-tune my abilities. All right. Oh my god, I hear two voices. How busy is it in the tavern? Okay. Come in. Come inside. Listen. No, sh. Gah. Sh. Sh. Jeez. Just bring it down a notch. Apparently, Dotty had a bit of a run-in with some of that Vasselheim-- Yeah. (all laugh) We had a bit of a run-in-- -- and Doty may or may not have paddy-caked some of the guards, so, like, we need to remove-- Well, there it is. Yeah. He's been like this. He's been doing this for about half an hour, so-- I think they were-- Look, Percy. Vax. I think you you need to remove-- You need to remove-- -- Doty's disguise. Yeah. They'll be looking for a giant red-haired-- -- eight-foot-tall-- You're right. Yep. I did. I don't know. I'm really strong these days. It was like an act of mercy, really. No, no. 19. (all laugh) 20. No no. Look, from what I understand, these guards were attracted to the horrific disguise that Doty had. He knocked them out, brought them in. I checked for, like, a pulse, checked their knee reflexes, and they were on death's door, so I just finished the deal. It was really merciful. Yeah, no, he's really impressive actually. Have a little more respect. Well, I don't know, we weren't-- Yeah. And to be even more fair, they'd been drinking all day. Smelled like alcohol. (all laugh) You bet your ass you do, that's a 20! That's a 20! I'm never gonna roll that high again. Yeah. Is there a little bit of vomit on there? No, that's vomit. Yup. Nope. I forgot where I left them. Yeah. Mm-hm. Who killed anybody? What? Yep. They're dead. Look, I was trying to protect our new friend here. It had to be done. He did say he wanted to see the twins, especially. Oh, God, look, fine, they're not dead! (sighs) No, I just knocked the life out of them, but they're not dead, right, wiretapping does not mean dead, all right? (all laugh) Yeah. SAM and Okay, look, they're fine, they might be covered in beer, we don't really need to go back for them. They didn't ask you to roll, Taliesin. Yep. (all laugh) He did. They're not dead. That's what I said like five minutes ago. How did you guys do? But you don't? Got that motherfucker. It's so strange man, they go up, they come back down. Yeah. That's five. Hey. Eat your vegetables, you'll look like this. Now get out of here! He'll be healthy, though. No, fuck those things. Nothing in green is good. They're really little. Yeah. (gasps) (all laugh) I'm good. Yeah. Oh, shit, Voice of the Tempest! You can never die. That was gorgeous, man. That was gorgeous. (sings) We built this-- No, no more. We'll see. Grog has a very discerning taste. Covered, girl. Matt, you did a great job.
