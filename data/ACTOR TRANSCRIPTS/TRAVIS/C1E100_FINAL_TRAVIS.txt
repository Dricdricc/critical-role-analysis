Eat it. Tensed. Your buttholes. (sings) It's the end of the month. TRAVIS & Bone Thugs? Thank you, Matt. (sings) Sorry. We already got copies, right? Yeah, it's so nice. She's not lying. She wanted to have the apron. Does it start with an 'AM'? Take a break! Sing it, Liam. Yeah, I have to put them on under each shirt. It's a real bitch. Warming up. We all go through the tree, yeah? Maybe you should. This is a ten-minute huddle? Are we attracting any awkward looks? You guys are all saying it wrong. I don't know why. Vax can pick it up, it's not that hard. Doran, you known Aes long? Yeah. Good guy? Right. Does he have a firm handshake? You should find out. Yeah, no, shake his hand. No, go ahead, right now. In his custom, 'no' means 'yes, I crave it deeply'. Oh, shit. 19. Known him for years. Really. No, I think you're probably gonna need a new job pretty soon. That was a diss. It's all right. Just look elsewhere. That's all I'm saying. Yeah, is that a thing? We've heard you've risen through the ranks. Very successful, you are. Well done. That's not surprising. Well, if you can't have an earnest relationship with someone, at least she's got money. He calls you the Crutch? Beer, ale, mead, or wine will cause you to regain 2d4 + 2 hit points. Yeah, you can only once until the next dawn. Fucking awesome. Tary, that is very considerate of you, yeah. Your hair's holding up well in the heat, though. You're not giving it to me? No. No! I mean, I wear, like, ears and fingers and toes around my neck, but you can always accessorize some more, fuck, shit! I'm the only one that walks around with alcohol on me all the time, anyway. Yeah. It's like a little traveler's bottle of soap. That's impressive. Oh, no, it's in good hands. Yeah, she changed back. Yeah. We head back out the cramped little tunnel. You can do the tree thing too? Have you ever tried? The bark's a little dry. Maybe it needs a little moisture. There you go. We'll use it to go back. Really? Doty, Taryon, Scanlan. It's worth it. How do we cover you? That's a chill-as-fuck duck, y'all! Duck Hunt! Shoot it! Vex! Were there people inside? Where's Vex? Can we also say that we put our earrings back in the next day? Because we're professionals. Curious little cat. We don't see a door. What percentage of your strength do you shoot it at? 70? 50? 25? Was the face there? Was it doing the life-sucking thing? I'll go in. Yeah, but I'm stacked for days. You did 65 percent of your... Do it! 26. Me. You are fucking fascinated with the god damn ash. You're on point. Keep going. 10. We going in or what? No. Yeah. (laughter) You didn't replace that? Tary, say hi. Scanlan, don't be rude. Respond. Lionel, there is a war room down in the bottom of this bitch. Yeah. It's got all the things people like you and me need. We're covered. Sand pit, fighting dummies. Shit. (laughter) Fair enough. Because of the beautiful spot behind you, can you give us one Vidal Sassoon wave of your-- It's kind of magnificent. Yeah! Where's the meat? That's true. I have an idea. Bring me a cow. No, I'm kidding. It worked once before. What? That'll give you the runs, you don't want that. I'm like the dog that's staring at the cat that stole its fucking bed. It's supreme. It's absolute. It's binding in all planes. This is bullshit, right? Everything I had, everything I was, right there. Just another one. I mean, he's big! Look at those feet! It's like clown feet! I bet he's a great swimmer. Yeah, too big. Right. Mm-hm. A new spot. Yeah, okay. Is somebody dying tomorrow? Are you going to die? Pike, you mean the world to me. Listen, I couldn't go on-- What? No! Yes. No! Yeah! Really? Are you sure? I can't tell. He changed the inside of the mansion. He's got a new dog sleeping in the sandpit. He called him his best man. You heard it. I did. Yeah. It's fucked up, is what it was. Kill him. Yeah! No, I like this idea. This is really something we can roll with! Yeah! He should miss us! In fact, he should be coming to beg us to be like, I miss you! You're so cool! Yeah! We've got to make him remember. Yep. Yeah. So tomorrow, all the tricks out the bag, throw caution to the wind, you and me, it's a show. Yeah. Just roll over. If you pile the sand up, you make little earmuffs. We're going to go. We go make a blanket fort. Yeah. It doesn't pick up. Don't defend this shit! Just because it's sweet doesn't mean that it's savory or satisfying. Any proteins that used to have a heartbeat, in any way? No? Yeah, fuck it. Pike and I go to peek out the door, because we're not eating shit vegan breakfast. What do you see? This is the perfect opportunity! I'm saying! You lead the way! Do it. Before we break through the door, I should yell something like, Pike, don't be so brave! Yeah. This is true. Yeah, just what happens. On the count of what? I can do that. All right. I have my blood axe. One. Oh, that's it, yeah. Three! Oh, Pike, you're so brave! You put yourself before others! Yeah, Great Weapon Master with the blood axe. I did my first attack, it was a 26, and so was the second one, both with Great Weapon Master. The first one was 26 damage. That's what up. I know, but I only do it to protect my friends! And the second one is 39 points of damage. With my bonus action, can I go into a rage and go, I kill these skeletons because I would never replace a friend like you! That hits. Also hits. Damn! That was amazing. Yeah, how could he miss it? (voice breaking) You and me against the world, huh? Yep, to the end. Best friends. I'm hitting things. A regular strike, 25. Ooh, and a 17. That's as low as I can roll. I know. 16 points of damage on the first one. That's embarrassing. I use the second strike on the same skeleton and hope Scanlan didn't notice. Fuck. 15 points of damage. Yeah. He saw it, didn't he? I fucked it up. He saw it and my whole plan's gone to shit. She's got the bruise on the-- Motherfucker. What? Are they all fucking sixes? Percy, take your hand off of him. I'm leaving. I'm going away. (strained voice) Yep. Real impressive. (strained voice) That was real cool. (strained voice) It was a good moment. That was really impressive. I'm broken on the inside. Did you see that display? (yells) Reckless, Great Weapon Master. (laughter) A one?! A one?!! (laughter and yelling) What is going on?! (laughter) I take out the giant cask of ale and I just... Both. No, stop. So, let me get this straight. You think you can go away for a year, and come back, in a disguise, and apologize to this group, and that's going to be good enough for me? And then when I'm still pissed, you're going to give me a combo apology with Pike, and that's going to be good enough for me? I'm still pissed. You came back in a costume. A costume! I'm not even really that smart, it's not hard to trick me. And I'm a big guy, but you made me feel small. I don't know if you missed us; I don't know if somebody is making us go down into this Zigga-fuck. Ziggurat. I don't even know why we're here. I thought maybe you'd come back and be like, oh my best mate, the guy that would do anything to keep me alive, there he is, I missed him. No. You come back, you've found yourself a brand new idiot. One that does amazing strikes, twice in a row. And talks to ducks. Has all sorts of new tricks, brand new model, new and improved in every way. I bet you do all sorts of fun things with him. So no. You do not get to apologize to me. No, Vex. He doesn't know that. It's a big word. It's a bit-- Aoo, ooh, shh. (whispering) I'm really embarrassed. I'm really embarrassed. (clears throat) Yeah, I don't feel like showing off my powers. I can't read the dirty hand of betrayal. Probably best to test it out. See if it's even worth anything. You'll kill him? He's all right. (hushed laughter) We'll see. By the way, I want you to know when you died, I sang a song I would never sing for anyone else, and I'm sorry you didn't hear it, but it was really hard. It is, I can just lean forward. Oh, you know, it's like the face of death in the hallway, once it uses up its power, it's done. Maybe. I would've gotten the name right. You Pass-Without-a-Traced us, right? Please both be old people. (laughter) What's in the box? Fucking leave it in the past! You want me to hide the bodies? I put the bodies in the Bag of Holding. (laughter) I'm trying to get over these double ones, man, I'm working it out. Your family's actually poorer because of you. For your face or for your armor? Oh my god! Campfire! What are we rolling? Oh, I did that already. 23. You opened this hole, man, you gotta pay for it! 17. Pike's doing this. Thanks for the confession, though. Let's split up. Safe to assume this goes to the same room, yeah? Just two different entrances? So let's flank. I'm going right. The map's right. Look at Percy. I broke the world for you returns! (laughs) What? 17. 15. These people kill ducks, Lionel. Is it me and Chad? 14. Okay, where does that sphere of vertical influence start? Awesome. I'm going to go into a rage and haul ass along this wall. I have advantage on those. 14. (screams) I raged at the beginning. Totally meant to do that. I'll attack. Hi. Might as well make a matching one. Reckless! Natural 20. (cheering) So I rolled a ten. Two more of these, seven. 31, 11, 42. Yeah, I'll keep trying to come to this wall. That's my turn. Come on, buddy! Stop touching him! From the skeleton minotaur? Gotcha. Okay. We've got to get you out of there. It's a start. 26. Where is he? The same fucking thing. Can you point to where Pike is on the map? Okay. The minotaur's down, right? And a dark paladin's still up there. It's not a gimme. I'm going to charge in towards the pedestal. What's the first thing that I reach? Yeah. Reckless, great weapon master. 27? Yep. Him, too. Reckless again. 20, even. Actually, I would like to smash the Titanstone Knuckles together and cast Enlarge on myself. Fee fie foe, you're fucked. It's extravagant. It's not poison, though, right? I have resistance against poison because of the Belt of Dwarvenkind. Okay. We'll time-jump. Smoke everybody outside that bitch. They disapparated. They're moving freely and it looked like pretty familiarly-- And they've done it before. Dexterity? Are there any enemies left on the map? Don't question it. Through his ankles. All right, we're going in the little sphere. Here we go. No, no, no. She manipulated it. Which is like the one that we've been around. Who has Speak with Dead? Not a lot of remains to be, you know. Well, listen, we're not going in the orb, right? Yeah, so let's drag one of these smart-looking fucks outside and have Pike do Twenty Questions. Sam, I think you're right. Yeah, we can. Yeah, let's step out of the range, see what happens. Which one, the dark paladin? Yeah. What? We don't need to talk to this dead person? Do it. How they access the gate.
