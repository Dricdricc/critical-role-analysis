Don't touch it, man! How long has that chicken been sitting in that box? Fucking hell. We have these amazing Loot Crate DX boxes! I'm a Baratheon, man, this means a lot to me! Holy shit! It's a Hogwarts book clip. This is so legit! Since 1963, drawing what acid does to your brain. I'm a Slytherin prefect, you need to go to bed, Mr. Mercer. I apparently have an accent for some reason. Yeah, you going to start a pet cemetery? Wow. That's so appropriate. That is the best name. She literally has 300 over here. This is fine. You're going to get seen. First roll of the night. Are we outside the courtyard or inside? More impassioned. Do we? That's a lot. Is it? That's like Chariots of Fire. You're doing the wrong music. (singing) Roll high, you blue-haired motherfucker. No, please, ladies first. No, I insist. The one that Vax shot that hit the ground-- Yeah, whatever. Oh, it's 200 feet. Oh, I'm good. Two ones in a row. I guess you've got to throw those dice away! Only 900 left. Can I rage, and can I take a swing at Falcor, please? Okay! Lovely. Could I make it a reckless attack, please? 25. Nine, 22, plus two points of necrotic, 24. Didn't seem like that big of a problem. That was not so tough. I know, you keep saying that number, like I know what it means, so let's get it on. How many hands? How many? Can I go full murderhobo status and find a group of people on the ground that need help? Damn it! Poor, my ass! That's what we were going to do, right? Yeah! That's basically what we had in mind. I thought so. I've see it happen. Really, I have. Impressive, Keyleth. Impressive. Yeah. Point it towards the enemies, okay? Yeah, me too. Take your clothes off, Taliesin, reset. Do it slowly. Do it. (yelling) For the rest of the game, you've got to look at that-- You're there, you're there. We have to do it again? Kill him anyway. And find out later. Eight. This man, this man is an elf, right? I think we should trust him. It's 40. I'm saying it's 40. Don't raise your hand like you got it right. It's playing Rock-Paper-Scissors and going-- Got it! Towards the door, right? And then try to get the-- Will it set the gate on fire? They all fail? Wait, that smoked all of them? (sings) That's true. Oh god! (groans in disgust) Where did you? Where?! What?! Yeah! So, I'll run up, because nobody fucks with Scanlan when I'm around. So I run up to the wyvern. Yeah. And I would like to take my axe and swing it in its stupid face. Reckless Attack. Great Weapon Master. 28 minus five is 23. Okay. Shhh! 25 plus ten is 35. Pretty rough? Yeah! I just want to finish off this little meat popsicle. Same thing. 19 plus a million. 33. No! Minus five. 28. Amazing. Can I use my-- Can I-- Yeah. I'll move towards the group on the left. Yeah. Oh! Oh! Yes! Thank you! Very good point! With my bloodaxe, if I kill a creature, I gain ten temporary hit points. Beautiful. And I don't think I get another hit. It's only criticals that I-- But still, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think the scale is wrong, Matt, I think you accidentally put things that are bigger than us on the map. They'll get that in the store as soon as possible. I will woo her. Oh my god, I'm going to barf. Yeah, sure it is! Did you die? Oh, and you look good doing it. You look good walking right off that edge. Percy! Can I ask you a question while she's waiting? A prone enemy. Do you get advantage on them? If they're prone? That's a natural crit, right? No, that's-- Got it. I'll run up to the bird-fire creature. And taking advantage of him being on the ground, I would like to go into a frenzied rage! And I would like to whale on this piece of shit. At advantage, right? Not as a-- I don't have to declare Reckless? Great! I will do Great Weapon Master. That and minus five is 22? Nice! Second one is 14, 28 minus-- that is 23? Six minus-- 21. Nice! All three hit. 18. Necrotic, four points. Oh god! 21. 31 for the first one. 33. And the third one. 20, 30. Hey, hey! That sucks! Ten points of burning damage. "Burning" damage. It does. (laughs) Hi! (laughter) Its what? Do I get advantage on these when I'm raging? I do, because I have Danger Sense. Natural 20. (cheering, air horn sounds) Okay. How's the beard doing? Just like Hagrid's, with the dragon egg? Reckless. 21. It's a 21. 23 with one point of necrotic. We were just starting to talk! Come on! It's a bird. Percy! Oh, so much fun. Awesome. I don't believe you. It's true! Oh. That's a 20-- Oh. I thought you meant natural. Halved to seven? So, total four-- and then the other half--? That's okay, I'll get you later. Punch yourself in the face! I'm going to punch you in the face. Kentucky. General what, did you say her name? Use your consonants, Mercer! Be honest, she is attracted to me as well. Okay. It hits. That hits, too. Okay. Blinks with frustration. 14? Ooh, Miss Piggy! That tickled. Can I use Retaliation to give her what's good for? Oh, you're right! I did! Damn it! Good call. Skivvies all right. Beard not so much. Kashaw, somewhere, goes "Ah!" Cool! (singing) Natural 20. Does that break his-- I know a lot about magic, you guys. Yay. Something bigger than the fire giant? I see the giant eyeing Scanlan and I'm like I thought you said I was your charge. You are not cheating on me this early in our relationship. And I take both of my attacks at general hot fire giant's face. Reckless. Great Weapon Master. 30 minus five is 25! 26 minus five is 21? Awesome! 34 for the first one, with six points of necrotic. 41. I rolled a d12 plus 13. I do! I would like to hit him again! Not that great. 21. 26, with five points of necrotic. Look, I am a one-fire-giant kind of guy. I get very upset about these things. I told you I was worth a date. Yeah. That's it. No, Pike! Okay. Naughty by nature? Have you been writing his name and your name in your notebook? Now, there are lots of people to choose from. She doesn't have to pick the most handsome. Why, what did you do? Nope. What, damage? So four total. Well, now I'm going to catch on. 25. I'm keeping track of this. Yeah! Hadouken! Tiger! You made wyvern juice! "Flank me." I don't think that means what you think it means. Danger Sense! 17. What'd you have to roll to succeed? Five zero?! Jean Grey! That's amazing! Yep. Stupid big bird! I run over and I would like to hit the giant flaming piece of shit. Reckless, Great Weapon Master. All the lasagna. 31 minus five is 27. No, 31 minus five is 26. That's good to know. That's a 17. And I'll do all three. 14. 20, 21, 31. 31. Eight, 21, 24, 34. Yeah. Six, 19, 21, 31. I hit it twice with my axe, and with the third one I pick up Pike and I use her to slice the bird open! Come on, Pikey-poo! You did do it! Monstah! Give me a growl! I turn around and I look up at Vex and I say, fucking cut it out! Yes! Platinum greatsword! End him. End him. Don't you wanna shoot me again? Oh, okay. How many points of damage did he take? Nice! He made a mistake. Could I ask Pike to heal me a little bit, please? Oh, you know, like a two-digit number. 25. Not if we tagteam. Like so big that I couldn't even wield it? 30 points. I know. Are you sure it's not a twig? He never saw the bottom of it. Until now. It's like the goo from Ghostbusters 2. "Talk angry." Are you serious? Oh yeah, we can! I'll go get him. I'll go get him. I go up and find the corpse of shitbag and bring it back. Should I put him on the ground or just hold him? I'll hold him up. Whoops, sorry, ooh, that's pouring out. How many questions do we get? You've been working with Thordak. What are his weaknesses? What if we put a bag over his head? What if you made yourself one of the lizardpeople, and then you had her down and you were using her to get info for Thordak? Are there secret entrances into Emon? Can you insight check a dead person? The teleportation circle. Two more. Yeah, yeah. I like that one. Insight check. Babysitter Trinket. I mean we can come back and stage here but we can't leave anybody here. We can stage here, but we can't leave anybody here. We can stage here. We can rally here. We can't leave anybody here now. Oh my lord. You had your hood up, it's okay. I would volunteer that we should head south and meet them where they are. Yep. Better than being here, 'cause we let people get away. You gotta reposition once you give your position away. Yeah, we're gonna march all 55. Yeah, is that where she is? You can't get 55 guys in the mansion, right? That sucks to hear. 75 percent. I mean, whatever those words mean. (laughter) Approximately. Come on, high insight. Do we want to do a last trip to Vasselheim to talk to Osysa or... since we got all the Vestiges? She was like, if you get these then I will help you. Did she say that? Yeah, that name. It's a sphinx. You lack imagination. Does anything happen when they're all touching? (laughter) You gotta say a word. Can Gilmore transport people like you can? I like Gilmore. No, bringing him with. Dude, he turned that guy into a little pretzel dough ball. Just because he fucked with him. Yeah, so can he. That's what he just said. Gilmore. (laughing) Hell yeah! But that was three and three. What'd you vote? That's four. Four and three. Yeah, it's four to three. We'll rest him up; he'll be great. Pretzel dough ball. It's gonna be amazing. We're taking Gilmore. If you got Lin Manuel next week, I will kill you. I'm just putting it out there, I don't want to have to kill you. Thank you, Loot Crate!
