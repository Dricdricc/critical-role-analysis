If there are balcony seats for the live show, do not be afraid of them, because that balcony crew is raucous. Just being in that room while the live madness is going on is something to behold, so even if it's the back, if you want to go, go. Why is there silly string coming out of the balcony? That was a good jingle, actually. Laura, would you consider selling used dice that end up in the jail too often? Just offload some of that shit. Oh shit. A fucking troll, you guys! Let's try and talk to it. Yeah, let's try and talk to him. (sobbing) No, far too calm. Which one of you wants to go first? Eight. What'd you roll? Yeah. (blubbing sounds) Surprise, bitches! He's a frenzied solo? What does that mean? Wow! Fuck! Yes! Oh man! I'm just saying, this is a last man standing kind of thing. That's okay. Think of the team! I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Hexblade's Curse on this giant. Hyuck Hyuck! I'm going to summon my Wastehunter falchion, two-handed, and I'm going to cut into his thigh. No. It was up until the second round and then that was it. 25. 13 points of damage plus two for the Hexblade's Curse. With my speed, I'm going to run to the north as far as 30 will carry me. I know, he's going to hit me next turn anyway. Armor class 15! Are they really? Double unos? You don't heal. Hit him. Fuck Molly! I love Molly, but fuck. Not as convincing. So casual, that's a good-- Oh no. That was pretty close, I think. (laughs) J-E-L-L-O! Stick and move. The what? That didn't-- MATT and Lovely. Yeah, I'm going to use Eldritch Blast. Shoot across the arena, 120 feet. Try and hit him. Yeah. That is a 16 plus six, 22. That is 12 plus two, 14 points of Eldritch Blast damage. Can I use the rest of my speed to move behind the column, so that I'm hiding behind the column? What? With the additional d6, yeah. I'll kill him! Not Nott. What? Oh, shit! MARISHA and Sand. That's all right, you're going to wake up, and you're going to fucking go apeshit. He doesn't roll to wake up or anything? Damn it, that would be great. Crit eye poke! Right. Forever. I look over at Caleb and say; No big deal, right? Old as balls. You just killed that old man. Well done, Nott. Catching on the power line. Not bad. That was very well fought. Impressive. Dwarf got game. The individuals that are in the more exotic clothing than we're used to, what can we see of them? What do they look like? Fjord. It's been an honor fighting in your Victory Pit. Have tensions eased in the city a bit since, you know, the incident? Well, in the tower with the-- yeah. That's indeed true, yeah. We found ourselves in harm's way. We're always looking for the next bit of adventure to put some coin in our pockets and do the city some good. Well, we're frequently at the-- what the name was the-- The Leaky Tap. Yep. Actually, on the Pillow Trove you know, sometimes people don't quite know the services we do for the city. Sure would help if we had some sort of slip or badge that would allow us to move more freely, you know? Most gracious of you. He certainly seems stressed. What? What are you talking about? Did you? Really? We're just starting to climb our way up through this thing. Anyone else pick up on those two individuals over in the corner? Outside your boundaries, here you go. Let's go. Sure. Yeah. I'll join you. Jester? Fair enough. What are they worried about? If we're going to help the city, the more we know, the better. As they start walking over, I'm going to wide flank to the left-- No, these two. I'd like to flank to the left and keep an eye on the crowd to see if anybody pays attention to two strangers approaching. DM, can I ask, is his name Trick-a-tick-a-ting-tong? What was his name? Boo! Rexxentrum. Which is where the Soltryce is. My whiskers! Well, did you say anything you didn't want to? What'd she do? Kryn. The green is something else. Right, allies. Plausible deniability. There was an M in there that wasn't supposed to be. Plausible demi-ability. LIAM and Are you interested in going there? If we're really going to be pulling out of this city that fast, haha. Maybe we should take advantage of these new badges we have and hit up the Tri-Spires. Fair enough. All at once? Dusk tomorrow. I believe that's 228 gold each. Same to you. It was very impressive. Where does fate take you after this night? Is that-- remind me again-- north of here? Northwest? Is this a contract that keeps on going or is there any set end date for you guys? Man, that is rough. We've been hearing little murmurs of action-- what direction is it? East of here. Indeed. Trouble stirring up. You hear anything about that? Since you're familiar with that trip back and forth, anything you would recommend us checking out? Just in case we decided to wander for a bit? I don't know, a good time, a bit of adventure. Maybe a bit of both. Maybe if it's not so gnarly? We hear that. Soltryce Academy is located there as well. Do you know anybody that's graduated from that academy? Fair enough. Well, I wish you the best. Indeed. Same to you. McGee. Suicide or one at a time? Yeah! One of those was full of dip spit. Did you tell him that he has to give you a dollar to engage your services? Well, by all means, let's stop by there and then let's see if there's a fancy place for us to-- We'll go by Pumat's later. It'll be fine. Plus, there's always one of those Pumats around. Tri-Spire. Pillow Trove. Get Jester's package. Get turnt up. Get some healing potions. Yeah! At Ren Faire, the more you drink, the more you spend. Lead the way, Jester! Yeah, we're them. Where are we going? Great segue. Yeah. I think two will do just fine. I'll cover the fellas' room. Here's four gold. Anything on the desk of value? Nice pen or anything? I keep waiting. Thank you for your help. We'll retire for the evening. Oh shit! You don't happen to work with the Ruby of the Sea, do you? Maybe lots? Jester, shall we? Shit. Everybody got those gifts brought to the room. That's a nice letter. Are you expecting more? (laughter) Whoosh! (imitates dramatic music) Are we going back out, or are we turning in? Some of us are beat to shit. All right, well, I'm getting tired. I'm going to turn in to the other room, if anybody feels like joining. Congratulations, Jester. That's very exciting. I don't know, I feel like after a day like today, pretty fucking deep. I'm just going to be turning my face to the wall. College roommates. Not anymore. I'll take an apple and say Godspeed. I will leave the room. I'm doing the old college hallway sit. Just outside the door like-- That's my room. Occupied. 18. Hey. How you doing? Yeah. Molly got a guy and a girl that walked in with food. Do you have people in there with food? Yeah, that sounds fine. What? Oh god. I can't tell who that's coming from. Everybody's lying! (yelling) Can I ask for everybody to leave the room, except for-- (laughter) How about we go say hi to Dolan, we'll run by The Gentleman, let him know that we're thinking about bouncing, and then we'll be on our way. I'm sure it's the city, right? Fair enough. We'll keep our eyes open. To Dolan's then. Yeah. Where are y'all going? Insight check! Just kidding. I'm good. Oh, shit. Maybe not to Dolan's, then. Because we got to get the fuck out of here. That's what I mean. Yeah. Of course. That's quite the offer. Seem to be opening up the whole kit and caboodle for us here. We understand your position, unfortunately you find us in a precarious time. As you can see, we don't have all of our fellows here with us and this morning's news caught us unawares. We'd need a fair bit of time to consider your offer, I'm afraid. We can't give you a yes or no right now. We have sympathy for your situation. Will you be here in a few hours if we need to return? Fair enough, your asks are fair. We'll return, quickly. We turn and leave. I do too, or something just as sinister. Let's find the others and get our story straight. We've already been, it's all right. Ham and Beth. We now have something that rivals a shopping episode. It's called the library. I mean, I have to give a small golf clap for-- Not Dolan. We are in Rexxentrum. We ate like three shepherd's pies. We fucking killed a guy and hid him in the room. We stuck him next to the skellington. For what? Uh-huh. Wow. Yeah, sure. Why not? Do I have to touch it or just look at it? I'll do both. Are you doing it, too? Sure. Was I supposed to say something? Oh, no. It was a crazy trip though. Yep. No? Well, I don't know. 10,000 gold, I mean, shit. Wouldn't mind earning 10,000 and then bouncing. Yeah, you're conscripted as long as you stay in town. Right, let's go to Pumat's. Had a bit of a tussle. Guess what we're back for? I know we were in here very recently. You haven't got any overnight special deliveries of anything interesting, have you? You're welcome. What was that other item you had? Does it work with medium armor? How much for that shield? I think I'm all right. We got an offer to work for the city, to be legionnaires. To protect it while its troops, hunters, and mercenaries are going to the front lines. There are bounties of up to 10,000 gold in reward if we stay. Our other option being fleeing the city? There were no postings for-- Believe so. Oh the Soltryce? Yeah, I'd like to see it, but I guess I'm not in a terrible rush. Sure. She seemed pretty heartfelt, I think a polite exit would be thoughtful. I'm going to go back to Pumat's. I'm going to buy that damn shield. Thank you. Not me. The opposite direction. Pro, 10,000 gold. Everybody rolls a d8? It was a d8? Six plus four, ten.
