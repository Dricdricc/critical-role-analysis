Put the stank down! Loot Crate! Jock said modifier, y'all. Yeah! Look at that thing! Don't let him get ahead of us! Open that thing! There you go. Man, you're good. That's a gift, man, that is a great gift. I'm not good at math so I believe you. Come give us a squeeze. We'll be at the convention hall and we'll be over at Petco in both places at different times. It makes me toot. (fart sound) That'd be great every time. (fart sound) Oh no. But you're the most interesting man in the world! I would like to announce that I have an egg on my pizza. It's just a mythical thing, you don't question it. Scales and claws. Make sure it was dead! We only have like 60 pounds of scales from previously, left over. (thumps) Umbrasyl's ghost. Then we can have, yeah, black and white scales. Oh, we're okay, there's not a bunch of big stuff in here. Oh that's fair! Then they can come back up and get it. 15,000. Higher! Higher! That's all right. Maxed out? I could do that, plus I could make myself really big for a little bit, too. Okay. Scanlan, she's metaphorically handing you the Quall. We're not taking any paintings. They're very heavy. Uh, I rolled a 16. Hold on! It's almost all broken anyway. Okay. If I die because of this... (laughter) Can I tip it upside down? Anything else? Can I shake it? Any more swishing? Can I put my head in the jug? Can I shake the jug? What is this witchcraft? (laughter) (echoes) No, no, no, no. What! What the hell? Oh. Come on, let me break it! It's obviously broken. Literally some sailors that are at sea? Yeah. So mostly grey. Oh, yeah! Dres Vina's-- Abjurist Noja's. Fuck off. Are there any pictures in the book? Completely worthless. It's awful cold-- See, it's a book about leadership, clearly it wants to communicate something to me-- Intelligence, right, thank you. Keyleth, you wanna trade the book for this stupid vase? Fine. I can have the book?! I'll take it. You're carrying around 100 pounds of shit? Will you stand up there and get me the vase? Gimme. Gimme! This is fucking brilliant. What's in the third basement? (shouting) Party down in the third basement! We're all going down. Shit yeah! CANNONBALL! Heh! Look at Scanlan's wiener in that picture. (laughs) Four and a half! (shouting) Keyleth! No! No! And I run over and pick her up off the bottom, which is essentially suffocating her, right? Gills, sorry. And I shove her back in the water. (laughter) Wait, is Percy in the water? Did you do a cannonball? Percy! I will! Okay. The sound of 10,000 pens hitting paper. Squash that! Ooh, snip diggity! I actually slip and fall backwards like-- (laughter) I look down and pull out a small piece of the kettle out of my pectoral and toss it away. That was very impressive, all of you. I'm very impressed. It seems that-- Oh, oh! I'm so sorry. No, no. Get it. Go do it. Well done, all around. Really, I'm really quite impressed. However, there was only one-- Yeah, wait. Is Vax going to do it? Is he coming down? No, there was only one that managed to draw blood with their display. Therefore, Percy is the winner. (applause) Well, I'm going to bed. Oh! Fowl! Well, I also went to my room and I was like "Man, what I could really--" and I was holding the jug, at the time, and I was like, "I'm just going to break it, nobody'll know--" It'll be great. And I was like, "I could really go for some beer right now," and all of a sudden, the jug was full of shitloads of beer. Yeah. Oh no, it's not never-ending. It stopped after a bit. But I got plenty fucking wasted. No, I said "mayonnaise" and it started to make mayonnaise and then it stopped so I think there's a finite amount of stuff it can make in a day. (disconcerted oohs) No, I ate that too. (laughter) Don't you have a broom? You ain't going to be climbing much. Yeah. Roshambo for it. Oh shit! Once a century? That's kind of perfect. When we're all cold and dead! Yeah! Right. Is there any lasting damage from the acid burns? I was going to ask beard? I may need a haircut in a day or two. Yes! I like it. No, we go fast. We go. Can I find my way to Zanror? Is his-- is she his wife? His woman-- Yeah. Did more than that, actually. Found our way up to the cave where Umbrasyl was. Left him in pieces. (laughs) A word of advice. If, as you're finding your way out of town, you were to stop by a certain cave, there might be some things for you to pick up. Your little one. You take care of him. Her. It. All right. I'm honored. Truly I am. But I lost a family, all those years ago. And while I will always think fondly of you, I have a new family now, and I must stay and guard them with my life. (crashing sound) Come on, it blew your hair back when it happened. Magnavox, like (squeal sound)! I'll keep that in mind. Travel safely. Yeah. Hm, totally sure, heh. You look out for that other eye now. Don't lose the other, because then you'll just be like (scared noise) in the dark. What, what? I didn't offer all of it. I said there was something to pick up. He might have grabbed a bunch of mud, what are you so upset about? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That son of a bitch! That thieving bastard? Blackfoot-- what was his name? Good kill. Good kill. Amazing. Couldn't have done any better. Yeah, me too. You make weapons? Oh, yeah! What is your expedition? No. No chance. (laughter) Well, Kerr, Pike and I are both from Westruun. Yeah. Yep. Oh, yeah? What have you heard? Yep, that's me. Totally. Grog. Grog is my name. Well, look, I would just like to put this forward. Westruun is their home. It's Pike's home, it's my home. And if you start running, you never really stop. Well, you can treat it like a weather shelter. If the dragons come, we set up an early warning system. They go underground. But this is their home. Kerr, are you an honest man? Can I insight check-- Oh yeah, you do that. (laughter) (high voice) Four. Three dollars off if you use lootcrate.com/criticalrole next week! You just dabbed to him. Wow, you pledge your life to him? Jeez. No, it's not. You do? That seems like such a shame. I mean, shouldn't we ask the people of Westruun if they want to stay or go? A town hall thing? That's what I said. Yeah. I don't-- It's so hard to find shelter and protection that's not a city where you're unwelcome in the first place. Are we returning the band? Yeah, right? I'm fucking over this shit! But there are stuff out there in the woods. There are things. I'd hate to send you into anything that all of a sudden got a bit too nasty. I see you wearing chain mail. If I may, what is your weapon of choice? Ooh. I reach out to shake his hand. I like your choice. Is there any way for them to contact you if shit goes down while they're up there? If we need to go in as the cavalry to the rescue? Hey, guys, so remember the farmer? Outside, and then he turned into a scarecrow? I found his daughter. No, no, I didn't know what to do. She looked like a deer in the headlights. She was in the prison with Abjurist Noja and Blackfoot, who's now dead. What's her name again? Amelia, really sweet. I brought her out before we took the fight to the dragon, so I think she's still in the town, but I don't want to tell her. Yeah, I know, and maybe give her a little coin, but, Pike, do you think maybe you could-- Yeah. Okay. Make him sound real brave, you know. Paint a good picture when you talk to her. Then we let them make their choice. Do we see Amelia? I'll stay with you, but just behind you. To Reggie. Amelia. You should also know, your father was a man of a few tricks. He told us that he had been saving this up for whenever you were old enough, but I think you should have it now. I hand her 400 gold pieces. I think he knew you would do well with it. Aye. I pour my flagon into hers. Yeah, it makes water. Give me water like the ocean! Yeah, look! Water. Did I do it wrong? Is there anybody else sleeping in the room? (whispers) Hey, should we wake up the rest of the people with this? Well, I'm feeling a bit salty this morning. (laughter) A little hair of the dog, huh? Are we day drinking? Can you talk through your poop? The finer points are lost on me. How about Pike talks to them? Yeah! You were born here. But you're genuine. The dragon's dead. We don't know if another one will come. And by the way, it's going to be a hot second before the carts come back from the cave, right? Wow. Fucking Shorthalt! Haylie? Maylie? They might. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. How about for those who want to stay, we help build some fortifications. For those who want to leave, we'll protect them on their way there. That would be bad. Scanlan, get their attention. Yeah, football rules! I'll come along to chaperone. No, I'm kidding. The Feywild is close. Why? You can't go by yourself. We're all going to Vasselheim. Christ. Use the link! Show your Critter power!
