Yeah! That's all I wanted! Please don't sue us. It wasn't passcode locked? There was no passcode? You're like an Italian mob boss right now. (mumbles) Wife, you are so cute. You better get rid of that shit by the time it's time to tear some people up! He did! Oh no, or "nondescript third party red licorice candy." We're going to have a live show in New York! First one ever! Sorry. We're excited. The real problem is that she never remembers her frickin' passwords, okay! What's up, brother? So much. I need to hear that shit. Drop me in. Should we shake the fucking water off? Oh, we're people. Are we inside? After all, brother and sister did need to have their fleas removed from so much time outside. Thanks. Sorry. You sound ragged and sexy as eff. I have no objections to getting started, I suppose. The sooner the better, right, brother? (singing) I'm widing in the wain. Don't be an idiot, that's not a real thing. I, too, am concerned. I agree, cause for concern. You're doing it, Peter! Caution may be the wiser choice here, brother. Yay, more going through the woods. My favorite. Let's go. We kill the horses before we-- (laughing, snarling). Not yet? Not yet. I wait. I tie mine to a tree, though, so I know where my snack is. Well, these two people are quite familiar with the woods and that of nature. I would not mind letting them go first. Ooh! First roll! 13. What is that?! Is that a belt? What is it? How much metal do you have on you? Barred from the inside? Right. Are there any signs of struggle or debris, arrows, staffs? 14. No signs of struggle. Strange they wouldn't be anticipating our arrival. Exactly. How many times has no one been here? Are you strong? I'll help you. You get advantage, if the DM allows it. Heel kick that shit. (singing) Ooh, Moonweaver! How does it smell? I was going to ask if the limbs were attached to anything, but I take it they're all separate? Really? Can you do it while be electrocuted and on fire? These doors don't fuck with the Loreleis! Normally the castle is approximately how many stories? Is this an underground level? Three stories, got it. We're on ground level. No. We're still outside. Just a moment. In case someone was anticipating us arriving, there could be a trap. Someone will pay for this, but can we please-- (gagging) open the other door. No. I'm not. I have allergies. It's a cart full of vegetables. What kind of plan do you need? Ooh, good question. Yeah, I hear it. Do we care to visit the pile of weapons? Everyone have what they need? In case, you know, someone needs to be dealt with. I'm good. I pull out two shortswords from my back harness underneath my jacket. I wonder if maybe this is not the time to bring up old shit? I'll join him. Aurra, is that where you smelled Father coming from? Then let's make haste, shall we? We head towards the gates of the keep. Are you a real weapon? You hear the termites in the wood. Nothing at all? No sounds? No creaks? Nice job, human weapon. Oh, I'm the tip of the spear, you're the human weapon? While she's doing that, can I ask Aurra if she smells Father in any particular direction? I was being genuine! What does that mean? What? Yes. Fresh print from the rain. Okay. Come on. Father is upstairs. Let's hurry! Lucius, hurry. Yes. He's got a shield! Nice layout. It's dope. Father's study first, then? It's not? Yeah, that's good. Portia. Would someone please go check the hand? It was a trap. Oh, shit! I don't know if you-- Is there gore behind the desk, on the walls? Does it look like he was (gagging) killed here or just the hand brought in later? No. 11. It looks like he was killed perhaps sitting here at his desk. Is it not fairly common to the eye? Yes. But if he was here at his desk, it begs the question why was he not on his feet and fighting? Or someone he knew. Possibly. Do we know of any enemies? Immediate enemies close to the family that Father might have had quarrels with? Sitting in his chair is not the way Father would have gone. Wouldn't you agree, Lucius? Agreed. Someone will pay for this. Damn. It's more than Father was able to. What did the letter say? The crypts? Do we know what the fastest way to the crypts would be? Let them bury her. Yes. Portia, Benicio, and I shall check the rest of the floor and then meet you in the courtyard by the weapons. (gasps) May I ask the firmness of the mattresses in each room. Was one too firm and one too soft and one just right? Son of a bitch! Thank god. Not that I was ever in your room when you went there. The pages that were torn out of the books, were the books of any import that I would notice? Math. Right, take the 's' off. So personal. Someone wiped their arse with one of my books? Did you do this? Do I believe him? Natural 19. Madness! Transform! I do. Sure. I'll take it. What do you mean pretend? I've been educated-- I had tutors from abroad and they rubbed off. Don't be jealous, okay? Jelly won't serve you here. (laughter) Yeah, the stinky bag and the knife were in your room, sister. How? Did he visit just the once? Oh, I do share with the blade to the both of them. 24. Yeah, we're like (inhaling) Flashback! It's raining, you moron. It is drizzling, you moron. It's only misting, it should last a good while. No, I'm always ready. You just add it in your head. Just do it on the fly. Yeah, like a domed entrance to the-- Mm-hmm. Fuck that. Going to carve them. Yes. I admit I feel a little, it's not as strong an urge, but yes, some. He speaks true. I'm already covered in muck. No objections. Do it, sister, set the tone. Yeah! Sorry. What? Well played, brother. Indeed. Oh amazing, in your werewolf form? 17. Does your keen nose sense anything? Lucius, if we're going to be making our way around, it wouldn't hurt to take both flanks. Yes, indeed. Yeah. Bros. Yeah I go and inspect one of the canvas tarps. I don't mind. I would assume we have the element of surprise, yes? The twins and Portia begin to creep closer towards the source of light. We moved to turn the corner. Oh shit. Oh my god. Look at your sheets. Oh shit! So this is a person-- This is a person, right? Anybody roll 25 to 20? No? Okay. I got 12. He front loaded them. That's what I asked him if he could. He said no. Portia, Benicio, Lawrence, Aurra, Lucius. You know what you're doing! I'm sure there's cords. Uncle Carl! You're not changing? I see my brother and sister making such quick work of whatever these creatures are, and I'll run towards this front gate. I would hope so, but I burst through dramatically. I will attack that first beastie in front of me. That is a 15. Nice! Oh, it's actually 16, sorry. That is a one. Four points of damage. Yes. That's embarrassing. Second attack. That is a 19 to hit. Excellent. (singing) Bonus, do I want to do anything? And I want to just stay there because of you. (speaking) Actually, yes, I'll use the rest of movement to come within melee of caped bastard. What's that? I will use my bonus action to imbue my shortswords with fire damage, and I will take negative six. The one in my right hand, okay? Right, not the stranger. That's correct. We better beat that bitch up top, I'm just saying. Yeah, you would. Yeah! Wonderful. Nice. Then what? (southern accented) Sho' nuff! The Lorelei family's been in these woods for a long time. Your favorite brother. Extra d6. Thanks for that, sister. Oh yeah, cover it. The cloaked ones? No! (sputtering) Get off me! I go over to the man in the ground and strike him verily. Shit! Better! 17! 13 with flame damage. Yeah, it's on fire! No, my shortsword. (tock) Thanks for the noogie. You might want to duck. I'll use the rest of my movement to take cover behind that pillar, echoing what Portia is doing as well. He tough. Death! So entitled! (singing) Hello, my name is-- (laughter) That's okay. They chasing that incense. They chasing that Nag Champa. Whatever's in that shit. I mean, they've got to be drawn to it, right? I don't know about that. We're going to find out, though. We're going to talk to her first. As long as they keep running, we're good. He dead. He chose-- TRAVIS and Are they on the other side of the fence, now? We won't have long. Plus strength. (sarcastically) You're what? You're bleeding? I'm sure you didn't do that intentionally. You did? You just ran into the middle of the battlefield where all the fucking skeletons are, away from everybody. I suppose it's one less share, really, for the inheritance. Best to let her go. (shouting) You're going too?! Fuck that noise. I'm going in the gate and up to the crypt door that is open and I can see down, right? Yeah, I'm going down that shit. Yes, I am. If I get to the bottom of the stairs before it turns right-- Gotcha. I don't know, she went to go do-- Can I see if I see anyone, smell anyone, hear anyone? 19, 17 plus two. I don't get it. I turn my head, I'm sorry, go ahead. I turn my head and I'll be like (shouting) Kill the woman to find out what she knows and get down here! Almost undetectable in the mist. You fucking morons. (laughter) Hey look, all the enemies left the entrance where we clearly have to go next. Let's go follow them! Aurra, Lucius, listen to me. Think of it. Only three shares for the fortune. Let's leave them. Fucking ridiculous! I can't believe it. You've been playing this for fucking years! You went after her! (shouting) Sure you can! No you don't, you don't even like her. Portia. Disembowel. Yeah, baby! I'm down here! It's very dark! H-O-U-L. Howl. H-O-W-L. Horse nipples. We know where everything was. Ooh, shit! (quietly) He's alive. Oh shit! No mercy. Oh, man. "Do you need a pro to--?" "She's still." Are you all done? It's very cold and dark! No! I am hesitant to proceed without you! Ten minutes? I did. In the time while they're resting, underneath the crypts. I slowly back out. I walk up the stairs. What the fuck are you doing?! You couldn't let me know? It was fine. No, I saw nothing. I'm not even sure we're in the right place. That is great. Perhaps it's time for us to continue below. Yes? I'll join my twin. Yeah. I'll pull out both shortswords and say-- If this elf is worth anything, he's laid some traps before us. I certainly would. By all means. 150 feet. So a dead end no longer. Whoa. I figured as much. Our road does not end here. Blood on the floor? Any signs of struggle? That's 18. Yep. Brilliant and idiot. Not yet. Oh, I do. I just have it like, in my belt. Would you like to see it? Yes, of course. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Yes, because I read. Huh. (escalating growling) (growling) Me too! TRAVIS and Yeah, as I start to Hulk out, I grab the peppered sides of my hair and I pull, and split my face. And the wolf maw comes out of it. My head is jet black with white racing stripes coming back from my eyes-- But the black only extends to my mid-sternum, where the rest of my body is peppered salty gray, black and white, and dappled spots. Not the nuts, not the nuts! (deep, wolf voice) Not the nuts! Yeah! Oh, shit! Who's that? Yeah. Yes. The exact same order so far. I rolled a 19. Freak nasty! Are you Crimson Rite-ing that sword? We're winning here, right? I'm happy. Bones! You get advantage on your strength checks. No, just plus one to your melee damage. This is what happens when you take Benicio instead of Lawrence, all right? You took the jughead. Does our speed increase as werewolves? No, it doesn't, does it? My fucking siblings disappear, and I'm like Ruh-roh! Watching all that happen in two six-second, back-to-back periods, and not being able to close the distance in 30 feet, I will run into that cove. Yeah. With my bonus action, I will cast Crimson Rite on my claws. Six total, yeah. Lightning damage. Shut up! Your sister helped you! You didn't know what happened. You just showed up there. I saw it in your face! (deep voice) I saw it in your face. Not good. Could you get between him and el spear? Nice call. Shit. I'm so excited right now! I feel aroused! Ah, Grandma! What fucking gnarly teeth you have! I just wrote, "Grandma" in the initiative order. What damage die does your sword do? Eight? Besides, you're a fucking werewolf! Let her have it! We're going to find out. Yeah, her claws aren't considered magical. No, it's not Woe-- it's Iron Hoe. LAURA, SAM, and Yeah, I'll run into the fray. 30 feet. Yeah. Flank her. Flank, please, yes. I'll take all three claw attacks. All at advantage? Natural 20 for the first one. LIAM and Second one is a 24. And that one is also a 24. Really amazing rolls. Yeah. I'll do the non-crits first. Seven and four is 11 points on the first one, including the lightning damage. Five and four is nine. No, I'm doing that one now. That's (counting) 17 points with lightning damage on the crit. Almost like iron? We have extra toilet paper to hand out. They're not Twizzlers. They're probably Costco, third-party brand red-- Oh shit. He got out of the Silence? Halved because her claws aren't magical? Or are they silvered or magical? Okay, 12 points, got it. 16. (coughing and wheezing). At the start of our turn-- Those of us in wolf form, we got to do that wisdom check. At the start of your turn, if you've taken damage, yeah. Uh-huh. (harsh, deep whisper) I catch it on my face. I have shit on my face. ERICA. You're not-- Do the thing? Do the other things? I'm going to do the other things. (exclaiming) (chants the Terminator 2 theme) Fuck yes! Oh, shit! Direwolf Hasted! Yeah, yeah, lot of shit going on in that area. The fucking doctor is in over here. This is some amazing shit. Four. I'm over there. Whoa! Which one? Which creature? I'm just running like a bitch. That's it! Or higher? Come on, come on! Attack her. You could also do any of your curses? Crit on that first one. 40 points total. That's your modifier. P-H-U-C-K. Is your slashing magical? Is it your glaive or your claws? Yeah, so it's a magic weapon. Me. You fucking dick. Advantage! Well, I'm a scared little bitch right now, and I have to roll a wisdom saving throw to see if I even hold-- I took 12 points of damage, so I have to roll-- no, ten. 17. I'm okay. What's that? Oh, but I don't have to turn tail and run the fuck away? Am I still in melee? Awesome. I'll take all three attacks at disadvantage at her. Okay. 13 plus six is 19? Nice. Second one, ten plus six-- 16. Eight and six, that's 14, so only one of those hits. That is-- four plus four is eight. One. Nine points of lighting damage. Okay. 12. Advantage? Great. Even worse. Nobody heard that except you. Does she leave my range? Do I get an attack? (singing) You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the form of wolf! Yes! Welcome to the table! How are we going to find that bastard? Yeah, she's supposed to get-- She hasn't really gone anywhere, she's just kicking ass. That's sorrow's bitch is legend. (exaggerated) Shit! Stalagmite. Don't throw it! Beat her to death with it! She's got two legendary actions a turn. She's bad news. Come on deep, bassy Riegel, get it. This time tomorrow you'll be high and sprightly all over again. No more allowance for you. I sent you a birthday card with a five dollar bill in it. I never hear anything. But I'm still frightened, right? Can I roll to see-- I have to roll at the very end of it. Son of a bitch ass! No! I can't! I can't move closer, right? Maybe I should just run in the other direction with my claws out and see if I hit that invisible drow. Fuck it, that's what I'm going to do! I'm going to run in this direction as fast as I can. I'm running parallel, right? All right, I'll run towards Aurra. Like further away, claws out to see if I hit anything. I'll use my action to dash over to this corner, claws out. Did I feel anything? (yelling) Can I roll to break the-- 18 plus one, 19! I just realized what I wanted to do with my-- Is dead grandma 60 feet away from me now or further? I have a bonus action, don't I? Speed, action to dash. No, as a bonus action, I can use my Blood Curse of the Marked. Mark an enemy within 60 feet and deal double Crimson Rite damage to it until the end of your turn. It does have to be in sight. Probably had blonde hair. You mean what plane? It's probably under the firmament. No, no, no. Oh shit! Thank you, sir. Can I ask a question? If the drow casts a spell, he can stay invisible after casting it? Yep. Yeah, I forgot when you cast when you're invisible you reveal. Yeah it does. Yeah! Both times. It's like he has color coded sheets. Terrible. Whoa. Yeah. "I pray." Nice. I've just finished running with my claws out in the air, and I see the little motherfucker run, and I'm like Bitch! I'll use my bonus action to now Blood Curse of the Marked on the drow. And I will close the distance on him and take three swipes-- TJ, LAURA, AND --with my Crimson Rite claws. Amplifying. 1d6 or just six? Three points of damage. Natural 20 on the first one. Second one is-- Oh, fuck! I'll take that, that seems very fair. Great, okay. So that's going to be (counting) 22 points of damage with the lightning Crimson Rite. Oh, and I double the Crimson Rite damage, which was the crit, so it was 12 points of Crimson Rite damage-- --so 24 on top of the ten, so 34. 34 total. Yeah, I know. One square away from getting the other two, fuck! I do get an attack of opportunity. That's cocked. That's a 19 plus-- Yeah. (counting) 15 points with the lightning damage. Damn! Fuck you! Yeah, give me a shot, man! 19. Can I do the same?! Roll like shit. Yeah! What the fuck?! Get off of me! Benicio! Yeah! So good! You never went wolf! Very smart, though. He was way more powerful that way. He saved our ass. Erica! Unless you got a good tutor!
