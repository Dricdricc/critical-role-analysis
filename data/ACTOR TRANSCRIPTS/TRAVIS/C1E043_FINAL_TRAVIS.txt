Might beat that one. Yeah. I'm an investment banker. She's got a tail! Can you slam down an hourglass for shopping? Get your ass in here! Yeah. I've been lifting lots of horses and mules and stuff. You did?! That was money well spent, my friend. You're very welcome. These are my lackeys, I have a band of-- you know, wandering-- It was, did you see me power-bomb him at the end? (laughs, then coughs) I'm good. Yeah, what'd you catch? And what was it posing as? Eight total. One, three, five, eight. What was it hiding as, by the way? Yeah, go for it, Vex. Wow. Four. (laughter) Oh yeah, trust me. When you have Grog-- you never leave? Hm? No, I've got like, three potions. Yeah. What, hey! What? What? I got a really great deal! Nope, no problem at all, you'll be doing business with me. (laughter) I don't know if you've noticed, but these twats below me need healing potions. Mm, whatever. Do you have anything like that on you? (calls out) I've got 6,500 gold to spend and I mean to spend quite a bit of it. Yeah. Mathis? (laughter) Yeah, like a paste. You know, I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but I'm actually the current reigning champion of the Crucible. And with that title comes many things, like people that manage your shinies. I would like to introduce you to my shiny manager, Vex. I didn't really hold it, it was like a flick. That's what I have! (loud whisper) 7,000! Oh, that's good! Yeah, are they well? In one piece? Neither do I. Keep your voice down. One superior, two greater, and ten-- Not that it's like, not for nothing, will you take this fucking dagger out of my arm? Yeah, if they're what they say they are. That's what I'd do. That lady's the worst. Are we fucking buying anything else or what are we doing now? Ooh! Yeah! Yeah, you are, you bad, intimidating motherfucker! Yeah, sure. Come on, shot-caller, pick one. Yes! Yeah? Yep, yep, Hammer, Hammer. You made me a hammer?! Really? That is amazing! I love hammers! Is it like a moon hammer? You don't-- you don't have it now? Oh, okay. Yep. No, no, it was-- it was Philip before, and now it's Grog. No, no, no. That was the first time, and then I came back and won my vengeance. Right? Yeah. Grog, Grog. (slurred) Inevitability. (slurred) Inevitability. Can I go and find the barkeep? Remember, right? It's just Grog. It's not like "Grog the Phillip." It's just Grog. No, it's all right, it's okay. So, does Earthbreaker Groon, does he ever come in here? Big guy, muscley, long, like, stringy-- He never comes out? "Medititive"? What? I don't understand. How do you do that? "Medititive." All right. Is he like--? All right. Thank you. Yeah, he did! And I want to like go see him, but I don't know anything about "medititiveness," like sleeping standing up. What should I, like, bring him a gift? Is anybody here, like, in the room right now behind me? Are they present at the Trial Forge very often? Hey, don't be so obvious. (laughter) All right. And I flip him a silver. Bing. We're just talking (laughs). All right. Wow. That went dark. Yeah, no, she can manage. Really? Hold on a second. And I run out the door. I run after him, out the door. 18. Wait! Kern! Kern! And I take off running after him. Hey. Funny seeing you here. Things been good? Right. Yeah. When I chew, my jaw goes to one side. It's fucking weird. Yeah. Yeah. So, I meant to ask you, that big, muscly, like long stringy white-haired guy that was watching our last fight. Yeah. Who is he to you? Yeah. Angry? Family issues? Tell me about it. No way! (laughter) I know! You think goliath is any better? It's the same fucking thing! That's true, it is fucking cold out here. I can only imagine. I'm really sorry I took your lip off, by the way. That's true. Mine healed better. Hey, so. When you trained with him, because you were doing all that yoga pilates stuff. Did it help you out? Right. What did he ask in exchange for the tutorial? Help someone. In that Trial Forge, are there like, more of him, like a bunch of big, jacked-out guys in there? Right. I won't take up too much more of your time, but if I could ask you one last thing. Aside from the Slayer's Take and the Trial Forge, if you had to find men at arms, men to attack a very large foe, possibly quite dangerous, where would you go? Yeah. Well, it's been good seeing you. No one hit quite as hard as you did. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Kern. Kord's strength to you, my friend. I go back into the tavern. Yep, yep, there's a lot of pieces of him all over the alley! Yeah, I like, left nothing to find. It's great. Shut the-- that is not what we were doing. Swung what way? Yes! I love taco! Respect. Respect. I don't really feel like fighting. I just want to go talk to Master Splinter at the Trial Forge. I'm not in a rush. Oh Jesus. Oh, that's right. 18! Church! (laughter) Dented in. The Cinder King. Yeah, basically four big fuck-off chromatic dragons destroyed Emon and then Westruun and-- Allura was there, she was very upset. Yeah, Allie is fine. Oh. Hairy? Why, thank you. Don't have to hide it around me, it's okay. We still need to go talk to Earthbearer Groon and see what kind of lesson was there. Earthbearer Master Splinter. But the Earthbreaker is here. Yeah, let's go to the Earthbreaker. Yeah, right. He's got a pair of arms on him, doesn't he? Hold up, Kima. Hold up. What do you mean? Have you spoken with him before? I'm excited. Oh boy. Oh! Yes, clearly my presence is recognized in this great hall. Good day, good day. (laughter) It's all right. Pucker up, we're okay. How many monks, would you say? One-five. I walk up to within 20 feet of Earthbreaker Groon. Yeah. How deep is it lowered? Yeah, but I meant the depression, is it like a couple feet? Okay, cool. Yeah. Oh, shit. Yeah. So. Does he move at all? I put my fist in my hand and I bow slightly. Does he move at all? We have traveled near and far, great Grood. And we would like to request upon you a moment of your time? Like a protein shake. He said my full name. (wheezing sounds) In my anger. 19. (whispers) Pike's not here. Do they have to be here? (sighs) I choose my buddy Pike. I don't care, I just say it anyway. I choose Vax and I choose Scanlan. Yep. 19. I don't know what you're so worried about. Okay. (laughing) 27 and 26? Oh, it misses! (laughter) Yeah, that hits too. Seven. (panting) I. Would like. To rage. I'd like to stand up, please. (laughter) I take out Craven Edge, and I'd like to swing twice against him. That's a 25? 25 hits, that's good. And a 17. Misses. 18. 21 points of damage. And roll for the DC. Son of a bitch. Can I move, or is getting up my movement? I want to move around, just stay right next to him, but move around behind him. Yeah. Now in the middle of the room. That's the best. I ain't using it. (yelling) What, like, so if we hit him, does he wake up? You fucking end him and you end him now. Yeah, but he might not hit him anyway, he rolls for it. We're waiting to see if he's awake or not. No! And I go into a frenzied rage. If it's gonna be an ass-beating we take, we might as well just get on with it. And I'll use reckless attack and Great Weapon Master against him. Which means he gets advantage on everything against me, but fuck it, he's hitting anyway. Oh, 19, so close. 28. 23? 16. Damn it. Those were high. Okay. I'm not listening to any of you. (laughter) Four, nine, 17, 27 on the second one, and the third one missed. He made both those checks okay? Yeah. Picked you for a reason, add that shit up, man. It's so juicy, so savory. Before I whooped somebody's ass. Piece of shit, I don't know what that stance is-- I chop at him some more with Craven Edge! I don't know, can I do one Great Weapon Master and the other two just regular? Okay. I'm gonna do that. Yeah, reckless. 16? 16. I'm gonna use my other d10 that's not tainted, so not this one. 27. Okay. So 12. 19. 29. Damn it, he does? 29. All that. Yeah, you think? Shit, really? Little distance, or? Okay. Can I move opposite of where my two lads are so I stay behind him again? Yep. Do it! Do it! Do it! If you don't do it, he will, do it. That's true, yeah. Jesus. You've gotta be kidding me, man. It's my turn? Yeah, I just keep swinging away. Yes, please. At the end of his turn, did he go back into his defensive pose? Okay, great. Okay, so, reckless attack. That's, let's make it Great Weapon Master with the inspiration. 24. Thank you. Should I do it for the next one, then? Okay. So that one didn't. Right, that makes sense. Right. So it was a 29, no, I mean it wasn't. What? Okay. Hit regardless. So we'll do the third one will be Great Weapon Master. This is disadvantage. Come on, where are the damn crits? 20. Yep, okay, this is Great Weapon Master. With adva-- with the inspiraton. 28? No, minus five. 23. Okay. Six, 11, 19 is the first one. Fuck. Nine, 17, 27. (sputters) Not once? Yeah, but he's gotta roll shitty sometimes. Can I move? Oh, I already moved. I wanted to move in between him and Scanlan, just wrap around. Okay, that'd be good. Yeah. Where you at? Pretty sure. Halved to five. Okay. 17. I'm gonna take Craven Edge and I'm gonna stab him into the sand. And I'm gonna take out the Firebrand Warhammer instead. Ten? You're right, it is. (laughter) No way at all. Reckless attack on all three swings. 14. That sucks. That's better. 27. Okay. Ow. Six, 11, 19. 11. In my friends. Scanlan. Vax. SAM and Do as I do. And I bow. And I walk backwards, still facing him to the edge of the pit, and I hoist Vax up. And I throw Scanlan up. Climb out. I don't know about you, but I think we got all the answers we needed. Apologies, apologies. We should leave now. Come by any time, we have a one-hour panel, we have a one-hour group signing, and we're at tables the rest of the time, so just come find us anytime during the day.
