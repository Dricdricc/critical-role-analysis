No anesthetic. (laughter) Did you dunk your head in a tub of ice and stuff? Totally good. Oh, right off the bat? We rolled low. Level two! Nope. Three. Zero. You're one, right? Son of a bitch. Thank god there's that cart right there. There goes that idea. We just can't be here. It's all right. Work it out. (singing) Rewind! Look at that mini! Cut them down with those guns. Both barrels. Six shooter. Give it to them. Knock them prone? I like that a lot. You can't be too cocky. What's inside? (sneezing) Fucking cat. Come on, iron snitch. Yeah, dude. "I'm just going to make him cry"! Not the jacket! Wow! Your dice just ollied off of the side of your dice tray! If this was Tony Hawk, you would be accumulating points still, it's racking it up. Oh yeah, can I fucking run up past the cart? Charge into the fray with my 30 speed. Can I pull out my falchion? I'll flip it over so it's pommel up and I will use Eldritch Blast towards the remaining zombie. That is a 14. I'm telling you, it's all happening you guys! That is nine points of damage. I look around and say we need to drop this fucker and get the hell out of Dodge. (laughing) If you weren't drinking a sea anemone. Damn, that armor's helping it, huh? That's awesome. What dice did you use? (screaming) No, look what you did! Come back to bite you in the anus. Come on, baby. (laughing) Yeah, first one! Write the history books. You didn't fall into the fire, right? Are you sure? Because of your magical, technicolor dreamcoat? So brave. Nice. Molly. Well, next up, as this is now important, Jester it's your turn. She has desserts. No vanilla extract or sprinkles? We still look like Crownsguard. Caleb and I. Did anybody see what happened or where that hellish toad went? You saw it? We can't be here. What? Where? I don't want to get these folk in any more trouble. How far is it from here to the lake? I say we could drag them and throw them into the lake to avoid suspicion on the carnival. We've got to get out of here. Where's Caleb? He was. I look around for Caleb. That's a devastating toot. Nott, have you seen Caleb? You got his little cat right there on your shoulder. We need to get out of here. We need to follow after that toad. That's actually not a terrible idea. That's a great idea. Let's do that. Who wants to help me with the one totally charred body? Shit. Never would have known. I'll help you. I mean it's either that or leave the carnival and take the fall for what is two dead crownsguard. Where'd you go? You shot shit out of your hands. I don't think you were not brave. That was really impressive. It was fire. It's a figure of fucking speech. Yeah, okay. We go back over there and we fucking grab Molly. I grab him by his horns. Is that single horse a mustang? What? Can I ask a simple question? It's not a mare? I'm just checking. I'm just very curious as to the sex of the horse, that's all. 12. No, 14. Yeah. You'll find out. (laughter) You couldn't see us in the low light, but they chased after whatever caused this. Any previous episodes of this kind? We'll try and find some evidence that will exonerate you and we'll return. We should really get to stepping. Sure. I do. Shelby. Just deliver it to the PO Box, that's fine. In the direction the toad leapt. We might need to play it by ear. If it's too dangerous, we'll stand down. How about that? Yeah, you blanked out there for a second. Yeah. This is the best we can do for them. Lamplight on the boat? We're going to have to ditch this wagon anyway because we've got tracks. Vanity plate? What does it say? No, they don't have to go in the water, right? They're burned. It's not like they burned in the water. It would. That's what I just said. I wish I had something that could help Molly out. As we've been riding, have we seen any tracks that we think might have belonged to the toad? Since it was leaping in these huge arcs. Ugh, three. Why? We could get rid of the wagon later. Once the sun comes up-- No, no, we can't just leave. Let's see if we can find the toad. If the sun starts to break, then we'll make up our mind. Yes, kick them out. Anybody else want to look for some toad prints? We've been doing that already. That's actually a great idea. Come on, don't roll Sam's fucking dice. In the shape that it's in, this print. Are their toes pointing in a specific direction? 14. Two. One and a giant toad. Girl. Does one look like Gorilla Grodd and--- 12? We're not lucky enough to have any small boats along the shores that have been beached? Yeah, we got like four hours until sunrise. How do we feel about the knowledge that it's somewhere here in the lake, perhaps, or the other side? Circling back tomorrow? At least we'll avoid suspicion if we're at the inn. I'm sure we can find some charcoal. And you two seem to be able to move freely, without suspicion. And leave it outside town as we're making our way back. Maybe give the horse a little spank on the ass and send it on its way. Shall we? We head back. I thought we were going to head back to the village, to a good distance. We're taking the cart back to a distance from the city. Yeah, and then letting the horses run, so the-- sending the track off. Please roll bad. If there is any justice in the world... Horses are our new door! I'm going to use Mask of Many Faces to make myself look old. 18, but I'm also-- We made it! No knock on our door, only you two. Your jury summons is (groans). I'll open the door. Yes? I just shut the door. And dies. No hands in your pockets order. And it's about 230 to 300? In the next couple hours they said they would call for us. I was going to say, did they come to your room as well? I mean, we tell the truth, we did nothing wrong. I was thinking that if we get out of there tonight, fingers crossed, we should probably think about acquiring some sort of vessel to explore the lake tonight. Or I may be able to arrange free passage on a vessel. I have a little knack with, you know. Well, for a bit. Few years. Sure am! Yep. I have. It gets funnier every time, though, I got to say. It's all in the delivery. Is it too early in the campaign to walk away? And I fucking saunter away. And we didn't see anybody it fed on. How well did you know Kylre? Yeah, what did he feast on? I think we saw both the fast and the slow feeding methods. Yeah, weaknesses? Vulnerabilities? In the bathroom. Well, our day just got freed up. Are you sure you want to do this, with your cat? Anything else besides a bird? I mean, any kind of creature? It can be killed is an important thing to know. I only mean, if it's important to you, in a moment of danger I would try to save it, but if that's not important. Fair enough. That's very impressive. I have ten gold. Well, if you'd like, you could stay at the inn, or we could acquire that boat and once you're on board we could send it out as a sort of a recon. It is daytime right now, it would require us leaving now. A what? We should take advantage of the daytime. Out the windows as we did before? Perhaps we should go upstairs-- If that's the case, we'll get the boat. If not, we'll let drone sparrow activate. We could try to go out the side of the windows. It is daytime. Can we say we're doing this from one of our rooms? Yep, there's that bullshit again. He talks. He will talk to you out of the fucking blue. You kill us all. That is a hell of a talent you have. Can we ask what you saw? Was it busy water, was there lots of ships out? It's not a lull for any reason? Fair enough. Out the window, shall we? Is anyone else going to be heading out the front door besides Caleb, Nott, and myself? I think that's smart. That's great, yeah. He has tentacles now. Can I use Mask of Many Faces to change into that older gray-haired farmer? Using D&D Beyond. (laughter) I can do that. Do you want to come along on this little escapade? Fair enough. So I'll head out the front. Can I locate the crownsguard? Can I run up to him and say (old raspy voice) You, please, over here! I've seen one of those creatures! It's tearing into him and it's horrible. Please, come quickly! 15. This way, quickly, please! It's a nordic "7." Weekend at Bernie's walking. Looking around at nothing. I look over my shoulder and keep running, and then go Oh, what do you want? Who are you? Why are you following me? Have I done something again? Have you seen my son? What's your name? You're a strong looking-- Oh dear. Do you have any coin? I'm sorry. No respect for the elderly, apparently. I walk away. (grunting) I make my way towards the docks. I think we may be able to avoid any kind of trading of currency. Let me see if I can find a boat that would accommodate all of us and see if we can find some amicable people. As a sailor, apparently I'm able to acquire free passage on ships. I have to talk the talk and maybe trade something, but-- Hello there. I was hoping that perhaps I could trouble you. We're trying to make our way out into the lake, some of my companions and I, for a small day trip. We've never quite been out on the lake, not this one. Is there a chance we could trade some work on your day's journey for some travel? I'm sorry, we're a bit light on coin. Is there perhaps anything we could help you with around here in trade? Indeed. Many years of my life. Port Damali. They never go away. Yes, it would help me look a bit more impressive in the eyes of my younger comrades. Much obliged. I go back. It fucking worked. Thanks. We should go. A bottle! Right. You don't happen to carry any fine firewhiskey on you, do you? If I gave you some money, could you go pick us up a nice bottle of some stuff? I don't trust you. If I gave you some money, could you--? I don't trust you either. Beau, I'm going to give you three gold. No. You can't come back with ten gold wine if I said I was broke. Right, yeah. Oh, well I'm glad. I'm partial to it myself. They haven't been on the water much. An island to the eyes of someone like him would appear-- Can I put an arm around Beau and have her come to the front of the boat so we can check out the waters as we're going, just for anything that might be-- 13. Crookedstone, here we come! Wow. There's Hail Marys and then there's that. Don't poke the DM. We're carrying nothing. Kentucky. Of course. Would someone help me down? We'll return. You can taste it, can't you? How about we fan out and move in? Keep a line. Within eye shot of each other. Well, yeah. Put me next to Beau. Jester and Nott switch. 16. Wow! Hold for a second. These shells have been devoured. I scoot up a little bit. I can see why they say a witch was here. It's pretty spooky in this light. Let's approach. Which means you are, too. Go for it, Molly. You're pointing at me? I don't want perception, you want Beau. Yeah, sure. We know that sound. Look at the size of that. The trees are awesome. Oh man! That fucking music. You and Frumpkin? Five. Sick. Oh, shit, right away. What? Look at the size of that thing. So excited right now! She wants to be our friend. Oh, shit. 17. Natural 17. Little larynx assault. That was so close. Disengage, baby! Over the top of the ruins, can I see the hellish toad? Can I use for my bonus action my Hexblade's Curse? I gain bonus to my damage rolls. A 19 or a 20 is a crit. When it dies, I might get something. I'm coming for you. I'll roll around the right side so I can see Toya. I'll use Eldritch Blast at Toya being held down by Beau. I'm sorry. The toad. That is a 19. That is a crit. Oh, it is melee. That's right. It is melee. Yeah, I'm staying right there. Plus six, so that's a 25. 13, 14, 15. 1d8 plus four, plus two for the Hexblade's Curse. Bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. It equals my proficiency bonus. Can I use the rest of my movement-- yeah, no, I'm good where I am. Times three right? Twenty feet speed. My apologies. The Hexblade's Curse is on any damage, it's not melee. I could roll an extra damage die, and it would be for that crit. The 19. It doesn't have to be melee. I had it right there and I should've read it. And it's a 1d10, not a 1d8. I was talking out my ass before. So ten. No, I rolled four. Thank you, just the four. He gains four? 14. You have AC 17? Yeah, because if it was AC, it would be just enough. But-- (inaudible auctioneer voice) (laughter) As a manure salesman. (laughter) New characters. Wow. Oh yeah, tiny dancer coming. Warhorn. All right, I have a question. Hexblade's Curse. If I do another bonus action, does Hexblade's Curse keep going? It doesn't say-- it says if the curse ends early or the target dies or you die or you're incapacitated, it drops but nothing else. It doesn't say. Fucking A. With my bonus action, can I cast Wrathful Smite? May I charge el toad from hell-o? 17 to hit. Beautiful. This is a 1d8. I didn't really say. So I'll go with the lower of the two. 1d8 plus four. 12 plus a 1d6 psychic damage and he has to make-- It is plus four. Let's see, 1d6 psychic damage, which is an additional one for 15. He makes a wisdom saving throw or he's frightened until the end of the spell. Oh, I think that's lower than my 14. I've got a spell save DC, y'all! Yes! It lasts until he can make a wisdom check against the spell save DC. Yeah, he's frightened. I can't believe this shit. 18. Can I grab the sword with two hands, please? 11 points of damage, and does that trigger another psychic attack? It says the next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration your attack deals an extra 1d6. Okay. So that's 11 plus five, so 16? Concentration. Can't use something else. Committed. Let's try to finish this motherfucker off. I run right past Jester as she's going, "Shit, shit!" Which is not in melee. Damn! Eldritch Blast! Yeah, I'll take one back. That is a 24. It's a 17. Plus six, 23. Sorry. That is eight plus four plus two. 12, 14, and the-- Thank you. 14. Oh shit! I run up. Stop. Realize how long its arms are. Flip the sword over. Look into the pommel, and fire it into his back, line him up. Yeah. That will hit. You motherfucker. Copy that. That is not big money. I'm pretty sure that is low, because that is a two. Yeah, that's a six. No, I'm unconscious. That is cool. There is one on the map. How many imps are left? TALIESIN and Damn trash pandas, get out of here! Three. There is a convention around the imp right now. Oh Jesus! Like Willem Dafoe as-- Even worse. Anything of the toad? I thought it burned away, no? What is it? What did you give me? What is this? That's foul. Well, why was he the only one? That's very true. Yeah, that's how I feel. We lived!
