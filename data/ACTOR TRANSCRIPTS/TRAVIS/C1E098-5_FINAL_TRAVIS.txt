Where? Right here? Did I get it? Are you allergic? That's kind of irrelevant right now, right? You have a comic collection? More than ten? More than ten comics? Yeah, raise your hand if you're on Team Right. (singing) Be prepared! Well fuck! No! My lighthearted self is now changed! That is not the same. There's like a seven percent chance I even pull something even close to that. That's a big prize! Yeah, like when you choose to become a goldfish from a thousand feet. Mr. Care-Package. Oh God. Okay! A two. Okay. Okay. What the fuck, man? 16. Just normal dex rolls? Or just straight up? Okay. 20. On the towers, on the far ends of the map, is there a back entrance to the tower, or just the door? Going up? Can't hide. No, I'm just talking shit. (grunts) I would like to rage! Just, oh, so angry! I don't like people putting me in strange places and floating down from the clouds, Colville. Can I equip-- yeah, fuck it. Fuck it. I'm going to stick with the Bloodaxe. Not the Dwarven Thrower. I know. I know. That might be a poor choice. Oh, you motherfuckers can fly! Bullshit, you're climbing up shit with spider boots. You know what, no, Dwarven Thrower. Dwarven Thrower, and can I start to climb the little rope ladder that's next to me? I just want to get a good lay of the land! I don't even know anybody's up there! 15. Do I have a bonus action? Oh, that's right, never mind. I blow a snot rocket when I get to the top. Dexterity check. No, no, let her do it. Build him out of aluminium? You take 5d4 damage? You ever see those sporting events where the beach ball's just going around the fucking crowd? Oh yeah, that hits. Like, gun-break misfire? Oh, and the psychic's not reduced, that's right. The psychic? Ones! 33. Aren't you concerned with the love of your life running across the courtyard? That is my AC. It's not too hard to hit me! Okay, halved. Mm-hm, I have resistance to lightning damage. Oh, which I'm not, yet! So 15 halved is eight, right? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This fight started and I'm like (machine gun fire). The fucking Godfather just (screaming). I climb up to the top of the tower like, what's going on? (machine gun fire) I take the Titanstone Knuckles and I smash them together and I cast Enlarge on myself. Is Doty up there with you? Can I go into a frenzied rage? And can I try and shove Doty off of the top of the tower? My wisdom ain't bad. My intelligence is dick-all. Okay. 14. Oh, because he's got Sanctuary on himself! Understood. Interesting. I choose to urinate all over-- no. Interesting, interesting. I don't learn lessons very well. I'm going to try again. One more time. I get three attacks, so. Yep. 17? Okay. Not strength, but athletics? That's higher. 24. I have some movement left. Right. Is there a trap door at the top of the tower? Would I need an action or a bonus to be able to open it? To go down into it? I have one-- well, I have an attack. Okay. Can I move to the-- Yeah, I'd like to go into the tower stairs. And I'm still inside, right? Great. As long as no one can... yeah. Fucking hamster ball piece of shit. You shut your damn mouth. No! It's so benignly designed. Please be nothing but black powder in the chest. Like Sonic the Hedgehog? Have you ever run in one of those balls on the water? They don't go anywhere, man. You're vomiting inside the sphere. Does Sanctuary stay on Doty now, or does it go away when I hit him? Call of Duty needs to copy this map. And the roofs of the chambers are stone, wood? On your turn! I'll remedy that shit. Can I rage-tiptoe up to the doorway at the bottom? And the fireball's around here? That's my AC. I mean, I'm literally doing this, so does she get me in the fucking eyeball? Oh, God. Nine? Oh, balls and ass. Okay, can I, after getting shot in the face-- Ernest goes to camp. Can I break out through the door and run down here to this corner as far as I can? How far do you think I can get with my movement? Okay. How far will that take me on those squares? To that corner. Yeah, actually, can I come towards you instead of going back that way, and can I lay down prone? Can I use my Second Wind to roll a 1d10? Okay. Plus my fighter level. Fucking A. Ten plus two. 12. That's my turn. Oh! Is that 50 more feet? Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah, let's just mad-dash tear ass towards the tower that shot me in the eyeball. I might not even get all the way, but we're going to see. Yeah, just turn the corner and book it like the T-1000 in Terminator 2, just chopping. Perimeter. Perimeter. Yeah! No you can't. Team Target Practice! Protect the book! Look, he's rolling for it! Do we have a certain amount of health potions or anything like that? Like a set number of them? Did we start with like a set number of health potions or anything? Like one each, or two each. Right. I have a shitload. Okay. I'm way too ragey to search for shit. Wait, wait. Ten rounds it lasts, right? Why is there a tapping on this end of the earpiece? No. Ooh, that shit's not water, it's acid! He called that shit poop. Let's team up, you and me. Which is not hard. No. You sneaky. That's okay, it's not a high modifier. That's a five. How do I get out? Fuck. Fuck! Like a rat in a cage. Really? I was picturing something from Saw, like the inside is just awful. Is it fish-eyed? I'm going to Rocky montage this shit. Wait, are you skipping me? I'm going to flip the fuck out! I'm inside of a goddamn box! I'm going to take my Dwarven Thrower and throw it as hard as I can at the window! Yep. Reckless! Yep. Almost a natural 20. 26. Awesome. I'm getting out of here in no time. 25. Yeah, 25 damage. That's right, double damage. Oh, really? Yeah, this is also Matt Mercer, who had us fight an entire thing, taking down damage the whole time while nothing was happening. I'll take all three attacks at the window. Reckless. Natural 20. That critical is 55. Fuck it! Natural 20. No, it's true. 60 this time, so 120. Halved to 13? And imploded from the inside? Because I reference Terminator 2 later... I was just going to do it because he's an idiot, but that really worked! Yeah! Misses. I know! (panting, warp sound effect, screaming) Hulk angry! Can I make my retaliation strike after her melee on me? Okay. Reckless! Where's the crit now? That's what I want to know. Oh yeah, you do get advantage. It is a 22. Nah, you're fine. No, that's going to hurt. I'm just kidding. Yeah, 25. That's it. Good to know. No one can hurt you in there anyway, right? I have pretty big legs. Is that a misfire? Oh yeah, that hits. Sorry. Grog doesn't understand why you're so mad at his shoulder. You just have a thing for me today. Misses. Because of Hex? Wisdom saves? Most things that I normally suck balls at anyway. Is it anything inside of the four pillars or in circles around each pillar? You can disengage now? Son of a bitch. How high is Vex? Okay. I'm on fire. I am going to stay on fire, because fuck it, and I am going to use my max speed to advance towards Percy. With my bonus action, can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping to jump 20 feet horizontally in the direction of Percy? Yeah. 19. Can I stick my finger in the bullet wound hole and taste it and go, hi. And can I take all three attacks, reckless, great weapon master, the whole smash. I know! Some phantom bastard. Oh, this is the hammer, so I don't have great weapon master. Yeah, I've been using the hammer. 28. Good to hear. That's a 26 for the first one. That's a natural 20. (giggling) I don't know what's happening. That's not part of the plan. Hey, that's okay, that's only a two, plus a lot. Well, the dice landed on a two, plus my modifier. Two? Oh, I can re-roll a one or two for damage. Thank you, Matthew. That's cocked. That's an eight. 72 points of damage. That's just the second hit. Well, it was a 24. 24 points of damage. Double the dice. Okay. Not the modifier, too? 32. Which is another damage dice. Right. Yeah. That's a ten. That's a nine. Third. 27 to hit? That's only 19 points of damage. (heavy footfalls, impact noise) Do I take any extra damage because I didn't put the fire out at the end of the round? That's great. Can you drop it prematurely if you want to, whenever you want? You're in the bomb shelter. You don't know. I like the ruling. (explosion, screams) That's unreal. That's my AC. Which I have disadvantage on? LAURA, MATT, and Okay. That's a 27. My constitution is amazing. Fuck. I had an action surge I forgot about last time, so consider this borrowed time. Come on, man. You got this. I absorb things that make me stronger. (laughter) Thank you. Can I take my retaliation strike? 26? 24. You may flee. Or you can stand here and face it, like a man. I already did. Hey, man. Better to be done by your lover than by me. I left that action surge out. I see Vex... But she was shooting at my quarry. I turn the corner towards where Percy is. (gasps) Percy von Fredrickstein de blah, skittles and balls and ass. What happened? Spin the hammer, right down on his head. (laughing) That's a 32. I start to swing down. Did he get new glasses? I take them. (heavy impact) (laughter) Oh, I can see very well. (laughter) How much speed did I use? 20. Can I use my bonus action to leap, with the feral leaping, 20 feet toward the tower? Entrance, down. 21. Can I use the remainder of my speed to run up the tower? Yep. Oh, I need to take the fire damage. Just this one. I took it last time. Two. On fire. 20 feet in? Is it a winding thing? How many rounds is this? Four? Five? Do you know where? 35, damn. Right. I don't see any immediate chests in this big tower, right? It's just a stairwell? All right. Live and let die, motherfuckers! Can I run out of the tower, straight towards the pool of acid? Yeah, I'm aiming to try and make my way to this structure. Lovely. I raise my hammer as I get to Trinket. I don't give a shit about Trinket. What square am I on? Yeah, I'll dash. Can I move to the chest? Can I use my action surge, which I have not used, to open the chest? Right, and I can't do anything else? Can I consume it? Yeah! That's right. Chug-a-lug, bitches. Gimme some squares. No, 4d4. I need some triangles. Yeah. 4d4 plus four. 14 points. That's my turn. 7d10?! Shit, so the passage through them would... He was?! Or he was not? When you moved, you said, "I go to you know where?" Yeah, that's an angle you can hold. Fucking right, she did. Yeah. Can I step out of the room? Can I use as my bonus action my Boots of Feral Leaping to jump 20 feet horizontally towards the building that Vex is on? Straight line towards the door. Straight up. That's a 22. Can I use the remainder of my 50 feet of speed to run into the building that Vex is in? Right there? Damn, I thought that was going to be just enough. I am going to dash inside. Great. That is my movement. Yes. It was a greater. Go now. That might be all she wrote. We'll find out. I have advantage on these. That's not awesome. That's better. 19? I've also been hit a lot. I don't like getting that close. Acted like I pushed you off. 25. Yes. So wait, where did you go? Okay. Yeah, I am. All right. Can I use my bonus action to take the healing potion in that room? 4d4? 15. Okay. And can I use my movement... to go to this corner behind the wall? Empty?! That's my turn. Are you serious right now? Do some shit! She's not hurt from it? At least finish him with dignity before you go into the pool. You just passed right by him. Just let him suffer, unconscious. It's all T2 tonight! They're both terrible? Wow, that is really stereotypical. We've got calculators out, ready to help. How many hit points does an adult dragon have? Like, triple digits? Why are we even in this fight? God, really? Balls, wanker, ass. Yeah, I did it loud. I was like, it's the other ones before the braziers. Shit, ass, nipples. 15. Hey! Sounds right. You're going to attack me over the giant red dragon? So six and one. Seven. Stay. About 15 feet up, you said? I was going to leave you alone. I was going to leave you alone! Fucking dragon sitting in a big-ass pool of acid. Piece of shit! And then the spiral's going to go off. Fuck it. I'm going to-- yeehaw howdy. Can I go to the rope ladder? How much does that take, to get to the rope ladder? 15. Can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping to jump 15 feet vertically? That's all I need. 25. Can I use the rest of my movement to climb up onto the turret and move to the far end? Can I see Vex? (whoosh) Reckless, please. 25. 19. No, that's the damage. That's a million. That's 34 to hit. And the damage is 24. Last one. That is a 25. You did it right. And you're trapped up here with me. Yes, it does. Fire elemental, back to Keyleth, into a dragon? That's true. Thank you. Thank you, sir. May I have another? 17. No. 21. One. But the fire's out! How much movement do you have? Are you checking on the state of Percy's brain? You're actually very fast. Yeah, the little slit windows? It is a strategy. I know. Standing there, with one hit point, acid melting my flesh, I would like to pull out the Deck of Many Things. I actually have this. It's blocked on the back, and each card represents each one of them. You can check it, if it's good. I think that's... It was a gift from a fan. I also have to name a number of cards that I would like to pull. There's not a ton that could help me, but fuck it. No, take your sweet time. It's not like we've been planning for a 100th episode or anything. We should. When is the 100th? Do you want to pick one for me? Wait, keep it face-down when you pick it. Okay, I get four, you get one. One, two... Ruin. The picture is a cliff exploding and a body flying off to his death. Great. Rogue? An individual standing in front of a devil with five swords going through his torso. Oh, it turns somebody against you? All right. Third card. If I survive this, and I'm acid-melted and laying there dying, and he walks up with a little butter knife, I'll be like, do it! Just do it! Star. Which, it seems to be the opposite of what's been happening, so maybe I'm fucked. Hey! Life score! Kill dragon score! Health score? Let's do that. That's important. I'm coming. We'll see. Key. I want the one that lets me succeed on my next venture. I should've just picked seven. I picked five; that was good. Yeah. Right. I got 30 minutes to waste. Just sitting here melting. The Knight. Do you have any health potions on you? Things are very bad. It's dire stakes. Kill the dragon. Yeah, dragon. Your courage is most important at this dire hour! 4th-level! Hey! Sweet. Hold on, come here, I need to draw some tattoos on you to make you look like me. Awesome. Right. Okay. I have 18 hit points. Everybody's alive. That's my turn. Were any of those draw again cards? Yeah, cool. Oh, I can move, because I'm alive. I live. At this moment. I would like to go down the trapdoor. Yes, with the friend. No! He's going to stand up there. Just double birds. Out going like this. And he has to go, "I am Grog!" The whole time. The second level. (grunts) That's it. It's a three. Poor bastard. Into creation for, what, 30 seconds? Attack of opportunity. What do you think? I swear. I want this dragon dead. I swear. Yes. Giant dragon. Give me these things. 9d8! And who rolls them? I have persistent rage. No! No. 46. 46 plus 18. I'm at 64, yeah. No. 18? What is the point? I pull out the rest of the-- no, I run up to the top of the tower. I ain't scared. It's absurd. And then she has all of her hit points left. I'm going to rush up to the giant red dragon and go Yo, Wilfred. This is how it's done, lad. And I do all three attacks, reckless, at the fucking dragon. I don't think so. That's a 32? 24 on the first one. Natural 20. Okay, so that was a nine, so 25. That was nine on the die. So that's 34. That's right, yeah. Ten, plus a three. 47. I definitely think about kicking her off the top of the tower. I think the attack is better. Yep. Reckless. That hits. 33. I know. 27. Plus five to hit. That's a 23. 24? Ten, one. You said 2d6 plus one? Right, so that's 13 for the first one. Six, seven. Ten. 23 total. I thought he was going to be in and out in a quick Pop Tart flash. Three attacks, bonus action. Can't do anything. Yep. It's a 19. Plus one. It's a 20 with a plus one, but I need a natural 20, I know. 19. I was like, aw, it has to be a 20. Yeah. My charisma's plus one. Reckless, for me. Buddy, first. That's a 23 to hit. Six. 28 to hit from me. 21 points of damage. Six, but I have resistance to cold. Ten cubes. She says, before she dies. 18. And I have resistance. Okay. Oh, I only have one target. I stride confidently to the edge of the tower, and I'd like to use my Boots of Feral Leaping to jump and bring my hammer down on top of Keyleth, on top of the tower. Oh yeah, don't be a one. That's pretty good. That's a 22. Reckless, I smash. That's a nine, so 18. 34. Let's not rush it. 43. 51. I reach down. I grab one of those jacked-up antlers, hold her up in the air. I look at Tary, and I lob it and smack her towards the acid pool. I want to hit her in the air towards the acid pool. Jesus. Yeah, 36? That is 12 plus eight. 20. One last attack. I look up at Tary and I'm like, you did save me. What do you want to do? I like your style. I have a throwing distance. It is ranged, so I think it's at disadvantage, which is 70 feet. So a regular roll, reckless. That's right. An eight. Nah. I'll let you go first. With my speed, can I run on this side of the structure to get cover? Yep. Down. Whatever blocks his line of sight from me. I'm resistant to poison. Really? Already? 18 is the first one. 18 on the second one. Danger sense. 16 reduced to eight? I climb back up on the roof. I walk over to Tary. How did I break the Sanctuary with Groon? I just booped him, right? Can I reach him with my fingertip? I'm going to try and hit him. Throw and hit. No. 13. Stubborn as a mule. 11. One more. Ooh! 19? Reckless. I got through, ma! 31. 26. With the rest of my movement, can I run back down off the roof and into the room? I ain't winning any beauty contests. (screams) Ones and twos. Here we go! Yeah. I've been burned, melted, burned, melted, and burned. Dexterity? 21. Plus two on a 19. Damn it. Sanctuary! How far above the roof of that building is he? Okay, never mind. I will leap horizontally towards the building that he is close to. 20 feet. I might not have made that. 17. I made it by one. Yeah, because I fall prone. So 20 feet horizontally, and then the rest of my speed to run to the building, climb up on the roof, and get right underneath him. I'd like to try and get through this fucking Sanctuary. 14. 19. 31. No, just to hit. Ten, 26. Who? Oh, really? He ate half of his cloak or whatever. A d8? 19? Which I have resistance to. Tary, at any time, you can just plop into the acid and it will all be over. You can drop in, listen to the bubbles consume your flesh. Be like soggy Cracklin' Oat Bran. That milk looks weird. 21. Let me guess. Sanctuary? I fucking walk off the roof and toward the edge of the acid and I'm like, okay, in range, and I'll-- First wisdom save. Goddamn, the fucking-- 17? It's a 37 to hit. 24 on the first hit, for damage. Oh, 26? 22. Natural 19. Son of a bitch. A million. 19 points of damage. I mean, after six rolls, you'd hope so. I am so sorry. I thought after I got through the first one it just dispelled it. The first one was a 24, I think? So you need to erase-- Oh, okay. I probably won't get through him, though. 15? 15. I'm sorry. I thought it dispelled it. 15? Oh, 29 points of damage? With the plus two to constitution from the card. 24. You're on top of the fucking tower? May I leap over the acid pit with the Boots of Feral Leaping, knowing I might fall in. No, I'm in there. 23. Where are you going, chicken? With my 50 feet of speed-- is there a chain hanging from the front of it? Can I climb that with 50 feet of speed? Probably not. No. I'm going to run into the tower and start running up the stairs. Yes, if it will get me to the top. Okay, that's fine. I'll dash. I have a request. With your hands. Please. Yes. I'm a simple man. You got it, man. I've got one hit point. This is your chance to claim your bravery for your house. (laughing) The fucking thing. Oh, good. Yeah. That's a natural 19. Natural 19. And I'd like to take my retaliation strike. How many hit points do you have? Oh, okay. Reckless. Come on, natural 20. No. 27. 25 points of damage. But not enough. This fucking magic is too much for this barbarian. I mean, goddamn. People are turning into flames, dragons, running around in a fucking hamster ball, setting me on fucking cold damage... I have plus 12 as the modifier to the roll. My constitution is plus 12. So I have to roll-- what's the math on that? 17 or higher? Seven. You got your fate dice. How many hit points did you have left? It's plus one. That's why I was like, ugh, it's a 19. That was a great map! That map was amazing. The three different varying-- If we had tried to hit one of the spires that created electricity, would that have ended that? Which one? Oh, really? The one down here in the lower left? What do you mean, is nasty? You are nasty! You were like the fucking Conclave. Jesus. The only thing you didn't turn into was a giant. That's true, yeah. And the Deck, yet again, didn't harm me. Taryon Darrington, champion of the battle royale. Kashaw won the first.
