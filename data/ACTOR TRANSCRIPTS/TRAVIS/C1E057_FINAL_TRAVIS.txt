Yeah, we do. So awesome. Yeah. We’re giving out crates in a chat room thing, don't we? Yeah. Is that-- did you just point and-- I'm in the chat right now. Totally. Top three faves. (similar accent) Critter. (similar accent) Critter community t-shirt. Do your worst. Show us your best. Yes! Bullman? Yeah, man. Anchorage moose. Yeah, limited 2-week run, y'all. Get it. There's an image on the website, right? You bastard. Sleep. It's sweet. They announced the Batman cast and Laura is playing Catwoman Selina Kyle. I play District Attorney LAURA AND We're gonna turn Gotham around. It's gonna be fun. Let's dive into the story. We have a lot of errands to do? Do you need any help with your errands? I don't know what that means, but I'm sure I take great offense. How effin' dare you. I spit out a feather. (pthh) Yeah. All right. To the Slayer's Take, then? Veiled threat. Probably a dragon. Nothing wrong with those. Fire! Put the flames out! Such a good burn. We should sell to a merchant? Love that you asked me that question. I don't know. (laughs) We can tell what my place in the party is. Tone it down two notches. Yeah. We have 60 pounds of-- Excuse us while we reminisce, apparently. Yeah, we do. We have 60 pounds of scales. Just scales. No hide, unfortunately. Yeah. 64, to be exact. Yeah. Sounds good. Besides, I've been working on that dragon immunity potion. It's 64. Like I just told you. But I could get rid of some other stuff. We also have 15 cases of expensive-ass bottles of wine. (quietly) There is some gross shit in this bag. (laughter) There are six basilisk eggs. I reach into the Bag of Holding and think about one basilisk egg. Can I get the smell? I'll put it back in the bag. All right. So what's next? Oh! I like the sound of that. I'll go with you. Yeah, three! Who else? Any other takers while Vax goes and gets a tattoo? Well, I thought that-- is that not what you're doing? (gasps) Phillip. Full name, Phillip. All right. Should we wait outside? He's dead. (laughter) Attaboy. Yeah, we're standing right here. All right, yeah. I shake him a little bit. Oh. So on the ground? Oh. Gas. I put him gently back on the ground. (laughing) The ladder he didn't use? Don't insult him. I know it. He's taken. I don't, no. I don't have any questions. None. Ooh. Good hat. Want me to give it a try? I vote for the claw. It's pretty cool. Hey, Percy. He wants the claw to be cooler than that lady's claw hand. All right. Then eff the old original hand. Let's give him a reasonable claw, yeah? Yeah. I like you. We'll see you later. (chuckles) I feel like you’re just on a higher level. Eating my mechanical pencil. (laughter) Yeah, we'd better. Fuck yeah. I love it. The guys are missing out on this one. (laughter) Bro, we got money. I am. (giggles) Oh, stop it. (laugh) Me? What? Oh, this streamlined. This is how the look goes. But that's part of it. My muscles ripple in the moisture. Oh. You think so? (stutters) Is it over my ears? I mean, I don't know, does it do anything? (screams) (everyone else laughs) No, please, more like-- a bit more like war, death, battlefield. More aggressive. This is a bit more like sheep-herder. (laughing) Conquistador's helmet? I'll take it. I don't even care if it fits. LIAM AND How much is it? Is the point very sharp? And I reach up and I... hit it with my finger. Yeah, it could be sharpened? Nothing, just look sharp. (groaning) Oh, see that sweet jam I just dropped there. Write that in a notebook somewhere. So is it one piece or is there a strap on the back or it just goes (foonk)? Beautiful. Rhino. What do you think? Hold on. What do you think? Am I fearsome? They have those? Milady, you are a master of your trade. Yeah, no, I got it. I got 50 gold of my own. Can I hit my head on the doorway on the way out? It is nice, right? Okay, good. 'Sup, bitches. What happened? I know, right? Wait for it. I know. It, like, changes my whole battle strategy. I'm now literally the point of the spear. (laughs) I'm a sea monster! I'm like the most wicked narwhal of all time! Give me a pool! (laughs) Yeah, you want to? Is it as tall as she is? Oh, yeah, look. Wait, turn around 180 degrees and then run as fast as you can. I pick her up by the feet. I yank it off of her head and put her back on the ground. Oh, yeah, hold on. (foomp) People respond to fear differently. He did? By the way, why is he covered in bloodbath? Did he kill a lot of people? He did? Oh my god. Like, how many on two hands? That's a legendary amount. That never happens. (quietly) What would-- why would you do this? (gasps) Do we see Percy when he comes in? Don't be stingy, share those with me. You'll find out. What about the Feywild? Wait, don't you have to pick up something? Not you, you. Oh, shit, balls, ass. All right. Really? Hold on, hold on, hold on. Are we alone in this room? I'm just saying. Yeah, let's go to the Feywild! We at least know that place. Are we bringing it back? No way. No, no, not the Plane of Fire. Just the Feywild. Hold on, is our stream up? Are we offline right now? The chat is saying it's off. What if we go there? She rolled a 20. Can I make one other suggestion? Emon... go take Thordak right now. Yeah, one taker? I'm just saying, I think we have an edge now. What are we doing? Like kill us all? No no no. Say they go first. "Go, go, go, go." And I kind of start teleporting through the tree and while I'm in the Sun Tree I just want to be like, "Hey, boo." We should check with the border patrol. Yeah. (whistles) I whistle as loud as I can. Must be off doing something (belches) important. Fuck yeah, let's go. Nothing else to do. You... Gilmore. (laughter) Wait, you said you were doing tests on it, right? Did you throw things at it? Did it blow up? They went away? Oh, jeez. Let's be honest, it's 2 hours. Fucking 20 minutes, my ass. On what plane are you right now? (laughs) "I'll be 20 minutes." The next day... I'm wearing the same shit. (laughter) Yeah. (laughing) Yeah. I paid money for this thing. Yeah, I know the feeling. (laughter) What are you wearing? Yeah, go change. (laughs) Yeah. That's better. What about a person? Sounds nasty. (laughs) No? Sorry. Hero. The djinn? Matt’s Vineyard is the best. I have a question. We've got one of the Vestiges in these Titanstone Knuckles, made from the heart-stone. If I left the plane with these, are they gonna blow everybody up? Oh, thank god. Kord. (whispering) Oh, shit. Wait, why is he digging and burrowing? Or is he looking for something? Is he not looking for something? I need more wine. Do you think he was just making himself at home, or do you think he was looking for something? Seize. You seen any dragons on the outskirts of the town? Have there been any flyovers or close calls within, say, 50 to 100 miles or so? Any reports? Far south. What about means of protection for Whitestone. Do you have a defense planned? A warning system? You, as well. On one condition. Don't wear any more dresses. I like you in your armor better. Yeah. (laughter) Yeah, Feywild. We even have a geographic-- demographic location to like-- I think you've had too much to drink, Scanlan. (quietly) The bow. My twigs smoke the doob. "Birkenstalks." (gasps) No. I ran out of dinner super fast and I ran outside of Vax's room and I took the jug and I whispered into it, "oil," and I poured one quart of oil on the ground outside of his door. Looked around real quick. Is there anyone in the hallway? 10. (giggles) And I run away. (laughter) Come on, big money, no whammies. (laughter) Ohhhh. Oh, that's right, you did do that. Nicely done, Matt. That Raven Queen, whoo.
