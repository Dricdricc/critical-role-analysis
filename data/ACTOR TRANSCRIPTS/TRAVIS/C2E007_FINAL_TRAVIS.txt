Oh my god! If they don't make that they're fools! We're going to make that right? We're going to make that now. Tell me you were singing that in your car on the way home from work. You hit a particular high note and we're trying to do our best squeaky voice. Now it's worth more. Keep going. The shaft curves to the right. It's usually to the left, but whatever. Too fast! Like a fencer! That was amazing! Life or death. Here we go. You got it. We're with you. Life or death. (singing) Visual aid, visual aid. LIAM, TRAVIS, AND I'll be up front. I can do that. Fucking bugs. Yeah. Eldritch Blast for me, yeah. Nice. Come on, first roll of the night! Be fucking amazing. I've had better. An eight. Which one are you aiming at? She can't see shit. Jesus Christ. I'm the only other one that can see. Which one of them is the undead looking gnoll? That guy. I would like to aim at the dude on the right, the one closest to you, and I will carry over my Hex that is still up since it lasts an hour, so for my bonus action I will cast Hex on that motherfuck. I would like to use Eldritch Blast. Plus six, that's a 20. Nice. This is a 1d10 plus four. That's 11 plus five points of necrotic damage for 16 total. Spindly, what? Oh, man, I don't even know what that means! The luxurious life. Do it. Welcome! Welcome! You're sober now, right? Just doing this? What's the save? Ah, god! Yes! Shit! Eldritch Blast again at that motherfuck. 16 plus six, so 22? Eight plus four is 12 plus four points of necrotic for 16 total points of damage. Oh, there's an open fucking hole?! That's good to know! Oh, shit! Okay. Good to know! Fuck. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah! Dance harder, dance harder! Oh, yeah, that fails. He rolled a two, you're fine. 12. Damn! Would you say you whip your reed back and forth? You whip your reed back and forth? G-I-T. TRAVIS and That it is. Mini pole-vaulting? Stem the flow? It's good to dispatch two in one turn. Yeah! The call before it was clutch! That's pretty bad for him, though. I'd like to get line of sight on him. I look back at Caleb with his failed attempts and say Let me try mine. I'll move my Hex over to him. I'll fire an Eldritch Blast in his direction. That is only a 16. Four plus four, eight. Plus three points of necrotic for 11 damage. Three. We got two ears. No, no! Fresh doughnuts! You know do no harm, all that shit? I agree. What were you doing down here? We ourselves were comin' down trying to rescue folks. We do make a bit of a clatter. Shak√§ste, my name is Fjord. We are, like I said, on a rescue mission. Are you familiar with these tunnels, at all? Have you been down here before? He is. Smooth operator. I am concerned that there are more further on in these tunnels, but I think you're right, we won't be of any use to these people if we don't get them to safety first. Yeah, not that way, nope. That's the one. We should move together. There's no point in leaving just a few-- We'll be coming right back down. We just need to get them to safety. Plus, we could take a short rest up top while we're getting them folks to safety. Quietly, maybe? (chanting) Level three. Level three. Could be good bait later. We make our way back up to the top. That's a badass motherfucker, I'm just saying. I know. Number one fan club. Ugh. 15. SAM and It's going on, it's going. Perhaps we can create a little bit of a lure to bring back that single fellow closer to us and we dispatch him quietly. Who's real good at dispatching them quiet? I tell you what, if you summon some courage, I'll come with you. What does that do? That's good. No, but not much better. Eight. No. I screwed the pooch. I think y'all need to fucking join us. It was a really loud stage whisper. (laughter) What did he say? I'm with you. Let's take them on. I feel like I've never felt. You and me, let's take them. As soon as he fires, I will as well. Oh, me? 15. Can I say my bonus I move my Hex over to him? Fair enough. I tried it. 20 up, 20 down that side. Oh, we did say we were going to. I do. I think we should. We rescued the survivors, we gave them a little moment to grieve. I know but-- Yeah. Yes. Yeah. You hit short rest and it will pop up the number of hit dice you have. Thank you. 1d10 plus four. That is a ten plus four, 14. Oh that definitely hits. Damn. MARISHA, TRAVIS and Here we go. 21. On my bonus action, I'll cast Hex as well. That's five points of necrotic. Eight points of damage, five necrotic for 13 total. Pull it back into the tunnel! Fucking Beau and her ball bearings. I roll to maintain concentration because he hit me after I cast Hex. Oh no. Yeah, that's a six. Got to be honest with him. While we're waiting, can I cast Armor of Agathys on myself? (hissing sound) I pull the moisture out of the air and it forms frost all over me. Everybody chill. Wait, everybody. Be cool. (laughter) Yep. I'm good with that. You going to be a guard or a tackle? Let's get this one right. Can I call you Shaq? Molly, Nott, and Jester? Caleb's before Beau? I rolled a three. Talk tough. Yeah, I'll come up the stairs so I can get a line of sight on any of those motherfucks. Actually, I'll be behind Beau. Coming through! Eldritch Blast. The closest one. Only 14. Yep. Fair enough. That's my turn. Damn. He knew the location! He fucking studied up! Come on, 20. LIAM and What don't you have back there? They're going to spread pretty soon. Right after you. One time! Yeah! I pick myself up out of my prone position there on the-- I know, I was commenting on the way I was laying. Can I come up to the top of the stairs, right there? Keeping some of my movement left, and can I cast Eldritch Blast, at the gnoll that's standing in front of the big bad baby? 17. Nice. That plus six, that's eight points. With my bonus action, can I cast Hexblade's Curse on the big motherfucker and say Come on, you sack of shit, come get me. Can I use the rest of my movement to go back down the stairs? That's not a pit, is it? I thought they were stairs! I think it's five feet unless it's stronger. Could be ten. Give her your energy, guys. What the fuck are you doing? You got this. Yeah, because you did have patient dodge going, right? Two 11s! Two! 11s! Oh. Shit. Or one of the smaller ones if you want a higher rate of success, maybe. Keep going. Dude, Command is clutch. 16 hits? Dude, thank you for that. Because of that, I regain hit points equal to my warlock level plus my charisma modifier. Really appreciate that. Seven points I heal. That's fucking sweet. To blathe! Hey! We did not. Thunder. Can I use my full movement to come back up the stairs as far as I can? 30 feet. Eldritch Blast into the darker gnoll. Yes. Plus six. That is 21. All right. That is (counting) 15 points of Eldritch Blast damage. Yes. What is that word down there? I've gotta pee! Other people's dice. Negative. Horrible bastard. I don't see any support columns. I'm just going to say it. Yeah. You got to get pretty danger close to do that, though. I've got to stand up and look, make sure there's no damn holes. That's the baby, the little thing. Okay, no load bearing support columns that we can see right? Before shit started going wrong? Two survivors and two enemies, right? I love your enthusiasm, but I tend to agree with Molly here. Maybe the baby just stays put? I think I'm okay with that. It just ate a Crownsguard in half. Are there steps? Who are our two strongest? Jester? We're going to have to keep them busy. 18. I mean, no. Yeah. We're going to have to fan. Airborne? I have no idea what the order was. Can I move forward and end up right over there? Yeah and end up on his flank melee, please. I will unleash the full fury of my falchion into his side. Two-handed. 23. 13 points of damage. Slashing damage. The ten, two-handed. That is it. Bonus action to run your ass. Oh player, I've got the Armor of Agathys on. And he'll take ten points of cold damage. 16 hits. 14. Nope. Great, he takes another ten points of cold damage, as my Armor of-- She, thank you. As my Armor of Agathys. Do I get an attack? I don't think that's going to hit either, that's an eight. Welcome to my fucking three years. Wisdom saving throw. Big modifier of nothing. Six. What the fuck. It's not. Oh, I'm up? I'm a Hold Person! Nope! Fuck that die. Because you killed its baby! Or hit the fucking manticore. You got to unfreeze me, too. Technically, there are three of us out, because I ain't moving. If you could put a beat down on the priest, do it. I have a healing potion in my possessions. Who do I pour that potion into, you or you? What is it, an action or a bonus action to pour a health potion into somebody's mouth? I'll run down and pour a health potion into Jester's mouth. It was a regular. Can I use the rest of my movement to start running up the stairs? I don't know how much I have left. Okay, fair enough. Okay. Was I in melee of the priest? I'll stay in there, then. I couldn't see where I was. Yeah, I'll stay close. The fuck. Wow. Yeah, to all of us? TPK up in this business. Is goblin blood red or green? Red? Be worth a pretty penny? It's not like a tee off and then we go. We should stick to the plan. No! Fail! Whatever you want to do. (whispering) Backstory. (laughter) Well, time to light the TNT, let's go. I'll run up onto the nest and start looking for stuff. Natural 20. 24. I'll make an arcana check. I have a pretty high bonus, I don't think I'm proficient in it. I am proficient in it. Seven. Aw, fuck that thing. Yeah. Hey, Molly? You want to help me butcher that manticore head? Yeah. Yeah we'll be taking all of that. Just over the shoulder, just walk out. Even I couldn't carry that. I'm helping out. There are two horses. Yeah. We're the TBDs. He carried it in his ass.
