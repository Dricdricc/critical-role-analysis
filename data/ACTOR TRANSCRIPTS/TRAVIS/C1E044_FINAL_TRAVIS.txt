Do you boost signals in it? This is where we need the light change. That fucking hurt! (laughter) I mean, we found two of the vestibules of-- No, no, no. He mentioned, he mentioned Titanstone Knuckles. Yeah, yeah. It's a bit of a sensitive subject. (clears throat) I think my Uncle Kevdak has 'em. Yeah. The leader of our wandering herd? He has two prize weapons that he pretty much used to use to beat me, like, near death. No, we, he's still got them. Yeah, it's this thing, I lost the GPS tracker on them, so, no. Yeah, but he's real strong. And it's only one of two really powerful weapons he has, so hey, at least we know where one of them is. Just peachy. Like. Really great, no, it's fucking terrible. Yeah. What? Oh, good question. I want to insight check Kima. (laughter) No, it's really quite painless. It's pretty cool. Well, you don't have any reason to think that. Could be hanging from a tree branch. Yeah. Just hiding in plain sight. That's where I'd hide it. Well, I have a question, and not like I can really help with this, but should we go see if we can read about some article of shadow-death, whatever the fuck it's called? Like, is it in a library? No? Like what if they're super-old but they go by a different name or something? Oh, I've got two vials of that shit. Pictures or no pictures? All right. I'm in. (giggling) Purvan Pedobear? (giggling) Purvan Pedobear. Yeah, nobody's there. No, he's married, remember? So we also need maps, right? We need your maps. Wait, don't you have something for me, also? How big is it? I know I'm looking at it, but what does it look like? Whoa. This is beautiful. Can I hit something with it? What can I hit with it? Scanlan, come here. Just stand right there. I reach back halfway and give a quarter-measure (whoomp). Right into Scanlan. About the same as the Firebrand-ish? Okay. 14. No, I wanted to try out the hammer. Vax? Vax! Shit! Two. (laughter) Doing exactly what she does? It is. Four. (laughter) You stand right there. I swing down in an arc to try and hit Vax. (yelps) I killed him! He's all over me! His bits are all over me! What did you give me?! (screams) (weakly) I've killed him. I've killed poor Vax. What is this evil monstrosity? You're alive! Come here! And give him a big ol' squeeze. And I squeeze a little tighter to make sure he doesn't turn into mud. You turned into mud last time. Did it hurt? Did the Moon Hammer hurt you? Shit, this is like-- we're going to save this for the really nasty fellas. All right, I'm going to put this in the bag. You know, if a kid or Scanlan or Pike sees it? She'll be so furious. I put it in the Bag of Holding. (grunts, splutters) Respect. Let's do it. We're out. Can we control the direction that we move? How far away is it? Ish? The t-shirt exists. You really should just chain up with me and I'll get us there super quick. Like E.T. How high are we? I don't know. I walk up to the edge of the loch and I look in the water. What does the water look like? LAURA and It's ice! Welcome! Are we all going in? But we were going to camp when we got here, right? Yeah, the Moon Hammer! Yeah, like in Whitestone. We're all going in there, anyway. What's the circumference of the lake? It's a giant pond. They're fucking feathers. It was just a bird? I go back to sleep. What about the little hole in the lake that we smashed? Is it still there, or did it freeze over? I got it, I'll do that. And I go and take my morning wee right on the little hole where it's starting to freeze back over. That's the sound of 20,000 pens hitting paper. Yeah. What happened to you two? How deep are they? Nah, you're good. Just swim. Oh, look. I mean, you're not even twinsies about it. You're at different lengths. You've got to even out a bit. Now, what are we moving? Here we go, let's move this shit. We're moving rocks. 20. Well, problem. Stairway, but when water comes back in, you drown in that stairway. So-- Yeah, risk it. Because we have to come back through this way, probably. Hey, sneaky-sneaky, go take a look. No, you, shitbrain. Oh, look at me, digging in a muddy hole that led to nowhere. Imperial Death March? MARY and I do, too. 17. Darkvision. 14. Everyone listen up. There's two of them and they're walking away from us down a hall. They don't see us yet. I like that. And I'll look at the one on the right. I tell Vax to stay on my six as I go up. I have that darkvision, too. That's not bad. 17. Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Get back. Back up. I just think you should go in front of me here, is all. Yeah, it looks a little slick, but just go ahead, just real careful. No, I'm kidding! Jesus, it falls off into eternity. It's instant death. What, you can't see? I grab my earring and I say, I'm on the right. It is a dead end all the way. Yeah, it's like 20 feet. Does anybody climb on anything? Can't you climb on shit? All right. Hey, Scanlan. What did you and Zahra find? It's like Professor X. Oh, now I can hear you. Like a sentry, I just keep looking that way. I'll stay in the very back and leaving the Dust of Tracelessness. I need popcorn for this. Yeah. I've got three greatswords that are shit. I rolled a one. 17. 11? (yells) Just drop me! Yeah, no big deal. Listen, an example of what not to do. Yeah. Should we proceed? What is all this dilly-dally? Yeah, I come over, and-- 'cause I have 60 feet of darkvision. Can I try? Nah, I can't see shit. What? Play? Don't waste an arrow. I don't know if anyone can hear you when you're whispering. Oh, 17. And 17. I love that you're pointing it at the TV. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Happy anniversary, you dicks. (laughter) What's going against him right now? I'm not raging or anything. 19. Petrification-- Is that above us or is that? Don't you fucking shoot that shit at me! And I go into a frenzied rage! And I will-- I'm going to just attack it regular, with Craven Edge. Just on this one, 'cause I don't know what hits yet. Yep. Terrible. 12. 17. 17 does not hit, FYI. I am going to move like the sweet dewdrop that I am, and haul ass behind-- I've got a little pointer. I'm going to move behind that column. Yeah. Just put it between me and him. That'll end my turn. That hits. She turns into a giant rock monster. Does the pillar grant me any cover at all? 19? 20, actually. 11 plus nine is 20. What? I'd like to run directly beneath it and slightly behind him. There we go, right there, that's perfect. And I would like to use the Chain of Returning on Craven Edge and throw it up into the bottom of the Beholder. 23. Yay, amazing! 19. Yeah, 19 points of damage. Oh, that's an eight. That's all right. Go for a ride. I did get the one strength one? Yes. Do I have to make a save? Yeah, I get advantage on those. Because of-- D-D-D-Danger Sense! 19-- 21. What kind of ray was it? Yeah, I remember that one. So tense in the silent moment before he said that. I hope that wasn't one you notched with the owlbear feathers. Wow. From the mother's mouth. (laughs) Hey! Yeah. It's my fucking sword. Yeehaw! How do you like them tentacles now? Can I run as far into the alcove that is at his rear, just underneath him, as far as I can? Yeah, right there. Maybe one step closer, so right underneath him. Yeah, so I'd like to pull the blade out. And can I-- awesome. 23? Can I hold the rest of my action and look at Scanlan and say, hey, Scanlan! Could you give me a lift? All right, I'm going to hold my action for Scanlan. 19. I think you might be just out of it. (cheering) I'm just slashing as I'm flying through the air. I would like to reckless attack, Great Weapon Master, all three of these. (laughter) Plus eight to damage. 19? 22? Five, 10, 18, 28, 36 for the first one. Nine, 14, 22, 32. Plus eight is 40. Yeah. It's like a hard sneeze. (chuckles) "And you're paralyzed." Yeah! Yeah, yeah. (laughing) There you go! You've got, like, 12 healing potions! Yeah? Pull her up and throw her down? Okay! That's fuckin' sick. Artists, go! You did! Did you feel anything squish when you landed? Did you black out? Shit, my insight's balls-- Five. Yeah, you's a badass bitch. Yeah? Oh, I so want to just throw the entire rope down. (laughter) Without holding onto the other end? No, no, no, I know what he means. Yeah, but I would throw the whole thing down. I throw it down to him. Hey, Vax, you got that rope yet? You fucking died. Yeah. We turned around. I pull your brother out of the pit, and you're laying there lifeless on the floor. How do you feel? That's a good question. Vax, how are you feeling? And Zahra. Hey, Vex, do you want any, like-- ale or anything? You-- I got some, like, firewater? Yeah. Well, I think that was the problem, right? Did we get it? Right. Here, here's a big flask of firewater. Look, I'm a giant tank and I've got a super long, like, sword, I could try and give it a pick-up if everybody backs away. I was going to put it in the Bag of Holding. Yeah. It was the runic things in the sarcophagus that set off that blast, not the leather itself? All right, yeah, let's put it in the Bag of Holding. You want to Mage Hand onto my swordy, and then we shish-kabob it into the bag? Yeah, no, I think a little treeline rest would be a good idea. Before we go anywhere else. Happy-one-year-anniversary extended edition. The best part of that was that you were totally out of the blast range, and you were like, "I want to go be there when they open up the sarcophagus." (explosion) Thank you Mary and Will, yes!
