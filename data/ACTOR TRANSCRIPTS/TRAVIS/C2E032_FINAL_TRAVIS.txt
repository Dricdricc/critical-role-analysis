That's what we do! You let them live? You merciful lord. (singing) D&D Beyond! That was so good. You gave up your ticket. The table's not a free ticket, man. Come on. The fucking glove. The glove is like-- (shouting) Motherfucking werewolves! (howling) He's in the Karate Hall of Fame or something like that. What?! Is that a term? DPTB?! Can we use that all the time, please? Dick in the peanut butter! Oh my god! (baby talk voice) Little dick in the peanut butter? (laughter) Retro tee, critter cap, Mighty Nein tee, Vox Machina pin. DTPB. (laughter) I need to pee. Yes! 21. Okay good, 20. Yeah, I'll help Caleb. Since we've traveled this once before. Did you want to join? I mean, ladies first if you-- Has everybody focused on that thing now? SAM, MARISHA, I should probably do that at some point. Oh, no! I wouldn't (hums). I just want to look. Why not? Okay. Leave it alone. Razor's edge. How do? Damn, note taker. Ten points to Gryffindor, fuck. Really good progress, yeah. Candleglow? No. Let's make our way over there. Yeah, he could be reinforcements. Hey, Caduceus, you should probably be aware we fought off a bunch of gnolls when we were making our way up through here. What kind of gnolls, you ask? Regular. Harder to fit in what we want to-- Yeah, The Mighty Nein has come calling. I don't know. Yep, that's it. Jester! How has it been? Busy? Peaceful? I think that's right, actually. Arrested? An indeterminate amount of time. This was the first one we made a clean, positive impact, though. Minimal collateral damage. No IOUs or you know-- Totally recognize him now. Kind of led to the influx of people going out? Is there any word from the south? We happen to be heading that way. Global Entry. Couldn't hurt. That's not true, Jester. I still have some plans for that letter. It does have his signature on it, though. Let them enjoy their drink, please. Jester, did you often "see it see it"? See it, see it. Really? Yeah, like you had a peep window or something. Actually, I'm with Beau now. I want to know your favorite one you've ever seen. Was it tattooed? You as well, yes. We wish you nothing but the best. You're a good person. That was an escalation, Nott. I feel like one, two, and then just nine. I haven't either. It's a bit warmer. A little humidity, yeah. Leave them on, you cook your fingers in some balsamic, it'll be great. Smell real nice when you pull them out. Like a cast. You get that cast off, you're like (sniffs deeply). Did they say where we were going to be put up, our lodging? Oh, where we are? Right. Yeah, that's a good point. We should make a stop. Yep. Never goes away. Yeah. Well, hey, after we pass Trostenwald, we'll get a break from that shit for a while. Salt on the wind, it's amazing. You know, I want some more. I'll give my position up to Caduceus or Jester, either one. You ask permission to ride the horse? Out loud, do you do this? All right, just checking. I didn't know if you had some mumbo jumbo. (mumbling) I don't think so. Am I talking? You're a seven-foot Bob Ross, I love it. You sacrifice Ronin to be able to do that. (laughter) Ho! Boom-shaka-laka-laka! Oh, shit. Careful crossing the-- (cawing). They giving you a bad feeling? Let's go check it out. Getting in between the two angles and having to go back and forth? Trees above us? It's just bingo, Caleb. Good fake out. I like it. Textbook. Now you die. Too many. Two times! Jester, if somebody left jewels for somebody else to pick up, and it's full of rocks, you might get that person killed. Oh yeah. You thought you were getting jewels, but you're getting rocks and shit! Love, The Iron Shepherds. I'm walking back towards the cart. So many dicks lost to the move, oh no. I think we were saying we should probably skedaddle. I jump in the invisible part of the cart. Dark salt and pepper hair? You couldn't see how long his hair was underneath? Pale skin? We got a stern warning as we left. Adla for short. I'm glad to see your prickly demeanor is still in shape. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, I was going to ask. (cat noises) Should we try to see Gustav tonight? Did you want to bail him out? You bailing him out tonight? That is so generous, Nott! I feel like we should just carry you through the town, crying out, "Gustav's release "paid by this sweet little girl!" Well, we could go in the morning, it doesn't matter. Excellent news. Very glad to hear that. We're just trying to achieve one thing, and that was hopefully to get some eyes on our good friend Gustav, if we could. Extended stay. How time flies. Maybe just a little something towards it, if we could. The circus and the fucking-- Whywolves. Too many. Too many, sorry. I know you've taken this burden on yourself, but I think we would all feel a bit better if you would accept this as a small thank you, for then and now as well. Why don't you make some tea and shut the fuck up for a second? Are we out of earshot? Let's all group shuffle out of earshot. (laughter) Caduceus! What was that? Where did that come from?! You can tell that just from looking at him? Come on, you tall, magical cow. Gold?! Don't have to empty the bedpans, change the sheets. Can I assist this as a charismatic fucking half-orc? Oh. What I just said. (singing) Listen to Beau, she knows the score. (laughter) And I wink. Excellent idea. No, she took off like she does. It's an expression. Yeah, just blunt. Yeah. Maybe we will-- We'll give you a little lessons in economics as we travel, just for fucking future parley situations. There's a lot of reasons. Yeah, we'll get into it, we got time. We need a damn whisper cam. Deep meaning. What's in the box? Way late! Yeah! The best part is when people try to explain it to other people, and they're like, "What does it mean?" And they say, "Dick in the peanut butter," and they'll be like (disbelieving) "No, what does it really mean?" It's dick in the peanut butter. Are you pretending to have actually looked in the Player's Handbook for once? You're half gnome and half minotaur. (whispers) Kill them now. (laughter) Yeah! To be honest with you, Caduceus, that was not here the last time I was here. Yeah, they're the Righteous Brand. I remember maybe a tenth of that. I assume border tensions are pretty high. I think we should be fine. After all, we're leaving, we're not entering. We've traveled four days to the south to the Wuyun Gates. You and I came through when we were coming north and there were a couple guards. Now there's like 50. Perhaps we empty the cart, walk on foot and say we're looking to go out and bring goods and wares back into the Empire. Caduceus, you've got a little-- Yep. They are searching both ways, it looks like. What kind of contraband do we have? We've got a couple pouches of fungus and that's about it. I agree. Let's risk it. Nothing wrong with having an invisible cart. Yep. Oh, the dodeca? Shouldn't I, since I've never done it before? But I don't underst-- (groans) (laughter) That's a hell of a thing. Calm yourself, Jester. Lock it up. Lock it up. Mount up, let's do this. We are but merchants heading south, down to Nicodranas and Port Damali, in search of goods and wares. Nothing but this cart. We are full of coin and yet have no products for trade. We hope to fix that south of the border. Some simple fabrics, meats. My friends haven't sampled the cuisine down there, and I was hoping to show them a bit of the Menagerie Coast. Ugh! Oh, that's right, I'm going to do that! That's better. 17. Do the gates look any different since the last time we were there? Scratch marks? More wear and tear? 19. Buddy. May this carry you into the playa well, my friend. Shh! Atta boy. Are you fucking kidding me? That worked. They're what? Yeah, we haven't seen Cadeceus yet. SAM and That's fucking awesome. What. The fuck. Oh my god. Wow. Yep. Or either way. Ten. She's got Flintstone feet. That change things. (singing) That's one way to die. Yeah, good luck. Optimus Prime. They can't see us, right? Oh my god! Oh Jesus, okay. So we're all doing the (sharp inhale). What do I do? I'm going to take two swings with the Summer Dance falchion at that guy right next to us. That does not-- that's a 13? That's great. And 16. So that's nine points of damage on the first. And that's five points of damage on the second, so 13 total. And with my bonus action, can I cast Hex Blade's Curse at the guy standing right next to us? Can I turn and say save the cart, scatter! (laughing) Fuck! I did! In most countries. Oh shit, you fucking-- She is, man! Yeah, I just got done seeing the T-Rex above my head, and big-ass Fjord knock it down and kill it. Happy to be out of death's doorway, I'm going to send two Eldritch Blasts towards the guy on the ground. 22. And 12. Just hits, great, okay. 1d10. That's seven and nine. So 16 points. Yes, it does. Shit. Oh, fuck. I saw it, Jester. Yeah, that was pretty cool. Got a little pee in my pants right now. Go away! Oh, hey Beau. She's so much bigger than she used to be! Yeah! Bat shit and sulfur. Oof. Drop the fucking-- (singing) I came in like a Fireball! How do you do that? What the fuck?! You can squat that. Let's go take a look. Call to him. Look to purchase, Jester! Just look! Kestiff, where are you coming from and where are you heading? That face. That face! Oh, that face! Look at that face! Sweet tiger cubs, into that. That's a fucking good peacock sound! That's what they sound like! That's going to be a dead pet. How many times did you hear that at your mom's house? What are you doing? Are you crazy?! What the fuck is the matter with you?! You're getting an owl? What do you do with an owl during a fight? Have you ever eaten tiger before? You're going to lose that puppy. It's going to blink itself off a cliff and you're never going to be the same. You're going to be devastated. He's talon into forearm, let's just be honest. Oh, don't lose that fucking digit. Now Beau, you know a pet is a lot of responsibility. (laughter) I just want you to understand, you're going to have to feed it, take care of it, clean up after it. You're leaving the puppy behind? You're leaving the sweet-- you're leaving the puppy behind? Can we start a pool about which animal dies first? Or lost. Just lost.You did this. You did this. He's got a fucking scar over his eye. (laughter) He's got a spiderweb right in the armpit. It's too much. Are you double guns weasel and dog? What's his name? Poof? Nugget? Into a tree. Be cruel, Matt. Do it. Hey! Jesus Christ, three animals. Plus three animals. Not one, maybe two. Ten extra legs now. Yeah, yeah! Fuck. I really want an over-under on how long it takes to lose one of those fucking things. And our best wishes to you three as you disappear into the desert.
