Dickholes. (laughs) Wow. Scaly. Scanlan Shorthalt. Yeah. I'm Grog Strongjaw. I'm a goliath barbarian, level nine. I have an intelligence of six normally, but now it's negative two. And my brain is made of applesauce. He's peeing. On a tree. Stealthily. Somebody pretty give me CPR. Okay. So here's your numbers. You leave my prostate alone. (all laugh) As they talk, Grog slowly flatulates. (all laugh) Thank you, chat room. Good question. What's your alignment? I mean-- What are goblins afraid of? Isn't that a famous, like-- What? Fucked up now. Naked. Not all dead. Ugh. Kittens. Ugh. Nachos. Ugh. I thought I was in algebra class again for a second there. (all laugh) Sorry, who woke me up from my sleep? (electronic beep) Keyleth? I run over and I give Keyleth a big ol' bear hug, squeezing maybe a bit too tight. I smell better than I ever have before. I reach into the bag of holding and I get the cask of ale and my goblet, and I pour a little goblet of ale and I give it to Keyleth. To me! (all laugh) I'm so glad you had advantage on that. My intelligence is-- What is it now? It's six, so-- I feel right as rain. What are we killing? (all laugh) Three. Blue, oh no, hold on. Square! (laughs) So do I, for some reason. It must be the morning. God bless you. Well, my cheeks are sort of sore for some reason, as if they've been slapped repeatedly by a bunch of twats, and then I've got this one little wet mark right here where I got a kiss and it smells like half-elvish spit. Oh Trinket, you big ol' furball. Trinket noogie. Can we go kill something now? Oh, I did? I do. Yes! 11 plus-- All right. 12. Great. (counts) Oh! Nipple tassels! That's way better. (all laugh) I've used two. Oh, ah. (all laugh) Oh, right. Sunglasses. (laughs) No. What? I know what that feels like. Are we with you? Did you put your finger in the hole? Oatmeal. Yeah. We come running up. Skipping. (sings) I take a few steps back. I have two potions of fox's cunning. Could I drink one of those, since there's a giant brain-bitch wondering around the camp? But it don't last very long. Not intelligence? All right, but if it's too late-- Intelligence checks? All right. It wouldn't make my intelligence higher? All right, never mind. Yeah, whoever's the smartest should be in the front. 14. Does that mean we get to run into a fight? Right. We do have a big dressing mirror. We have one mirror in the bag of holding. We move forward. And I light up the hooded lantern we have in the bag of holding. We like food. No food! TALIESIN and We've got to get it closer than that. Stealth check? (softly) Six. Yay, bell curve. Humanoid figures, you say? Awesome! Just cut the bridge (whispers) We have a flying carpet. Follow. (sputters) What? I give them her carpet, but I also tie the endless rope thread around. Shit. That's a ways. In the volcano? Just go straight down. (whispers) Are they still on-- I like it. (sings) Scanlan, the best bard. Do you activate hung at the same time? Okay. C'mon, buddy. Yes! (whispers) Trolls! Shit. Oh god! We are gonna fight the shit out of them. Great. How big was this mind flayer, was he like 20 feet tall, Scanlan? Was he bigger than me? Let's go fuck him up. What? It was rather restful. And those two big trolls. There are ogres? You know my tactic. We should use the volcano as part of our strategy. Like Moses-- Well no, the pit-- Yeah, there's a shitload of that. Oh, shitcakes. May your list be ever long, with your-- list. A what? Fudge. Why don't we-- Listen, when my Herd used to wander through the trees and we came upon a force that was greater than our own, we used the landscape to our ad-van-tage, so why don't we provoke an attack? And then retreat over the bridge. You said they were all gray-eyed, right? What? Yeah, like in 300. Which was a great puppet show I saw. Yeah. What's the bridge made of? "Only". Makes their numbers count for nothing. Oh shit. What kind of creatures can you make? Can I test something real quick? If I pull out the magic carpet or I take it back from whoever the fuck had it, and I stand on it, does it hold me up or do I sink? So this is a big problem. Yeah, which just slows my fall. It doesn't take me across. If we cut the bridge. You can just Fly me? Okay. I'm down for doing this. I like the mystical, magical-- Davy Jones. I'll stay on this side of the bridge, who wants to go be a distraction? Who wants to be the bait? Who's real fast? I don't-- What if you cast something big and they turn it against us? That could suck. How about we throw one of those and send-- How about 50/50 it? One fake, one real. One of us, one of the cards. Somebody be Gambit and throw that bitch. What's wrong with them running away from us? They're mind controlled-- Ooh! I like it! All right. Yep. Saddle up, let's do it. No, no-- I'm staying on our side of the bridge. Our side. No. They go, (yells) Once he gets back to our side. (yells) They come back, everybody falls in-- All right. So Tiberius and Vax are going over. Do it. Is Scanlan singing? Was that Gwen Stefani? You could have gave it to me. Goblin side. Yep. Go for it! You can fly. Yeah. She's fine. (snickers) We should call this a rim job. Sure it is. We're on the safe side with Bad News and me. Okay. Yes. Outstanding. Didn't occur to me that there is a bridge-- Yes! No, he's got it. He's getting it out. Oh my god! You almost died! Get your bow ready. Son of a bitch. The magic carpet is done? (tearfully) I have to erase it. Wait, do we leave or-- Okay. What're we gonna do? Leave? It's the carpet! I run and jump off the cliff! Yep, and I jumped all the way down. I have great form in mid-air. It's water. Yeah, but we go over one at a time and then we're waiting for-- If we don't find out. You can drop me like a depth charge. Vote. Vote. For fuck's sake, vote. Put it to a vote. That's four. What are you, Switzerland? C'mon. Fly, you fools! That doesn't do anything yet! We don't know! Yeah, I'm agreeing with Scanlan, and I am mooning off the cliff's face. Go check it out. No, go check it out, ladies. Grog says yes. No no no no. Be thorough. (all laugh) Are you sure? Go in there. No, no, no! Roll the shit out of that new dice. What is that? Oh my god! What's on your head? (whispers) Sense motive. I would do it, but-- 16. 16! (happy scream) 16! (all laugh) (whispers) It was because of the arcane! Break out the-- We should get some damn hats. Why me?
