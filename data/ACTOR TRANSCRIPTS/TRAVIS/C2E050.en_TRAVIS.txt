We play Dungeons & Dragons! That's total news. (triumphant yelling) Burn it down! Wow. True. Be careful with it, don't rush it! Don't rush it, it's too nice! Can we get copies of that after the show? No! Not ready! The laziest bail! Wow. Crash and burn. I love it when you can hear the DM's frustration in the retelling of the story. No! Yeah, maybe we should just leave. What do you think? Pack up and go. Mm. I'm good. Y'know. It was only a joke, Nott, sorry. Terrible timing. We should push on. Really? Lots of eyeballs? Sounds like a magic place. This fucker. Who has the best darkvision, I would imagine. We should have-- I have 60. The two clerics do not go shoulder-to-shoulder. Well, you got shitty darkvision. Oh, but you got the goggles. And who are you with? Nott? Darkvision for Yasha-- 60 feet. Decent. I don't know, maybe outside of the tunnel? Back at the place where we were? I will give you advantage. Helping, yeah. Well, as a bit of clarification, I think we weren't supposed to use it, right? Anything that would activate it and send off energy. I think as long as it's in the other dimension that is her bag, it's okay, right? You've got the gun and the clip. The only way they're going to grab it and turn it out is if most of us are dead, right? That's right. Let's push forward. Probably. And we've got lots of room to maneuver in these caverns. You know, dire honey badgers got claws and stuff. Maybe a dire sheep. Yeah, anyway. It'll hit you in the moment. I got a feeling. Totally. What are you rolling for? We press on. I forget what time we entered into the tunnel. What time of day was it? We could push on for another hour or two, but we really should-- You fucking feat. Absolutely. I'll help. Succinct. We are going to rest, right? I mean, might as well take advantage of such a nice place. Earthen? Backs against a wall are always safe. Five more. Wow. This is 100% what we're supposed to be doing. Confirmation. We're doing good. Do we want to take watches? We're pretty safe, right? SAM and Let's all try it. Everybody's sleeping. Look how pretty that book is. God. Sexy. Mm-hmm. (dripping water noises) Sorry, was I throwing you? Natural 20! 30. 30. Oh, balls and anus. Here you go. 22. No! 24. Oh, a river, pond. Yep, big-ass body of water. Big enough to show up on a map. Biped signs of life? Well, Jester, aren't temples better served by like, heavy foot traffic? You know-- We'll keep an eye on the entrance and exits. I'll go to over where we think from Beau's notes the creature seems to have gone. Mm-hmm. Nice. 20-- 20. No, 21. Oh no. 18 is pretty good, considering I have no initiative bonus. SAM and No! I don't know. Half-orcs. I don't know. I could have taken a feat that would've given me, but-- What is this thing?! What is that sadistic Japanese traffic cone? Oh fucking balls. What is this? (laughs) What the fuck is that? Is it? 18 for Fjord. Yasha got a 14. I do? Well I have a short moment of freak out as a rock formation grows fucking tentacles. Since the rest of the group doesn't seem to have noticed them, I will charge up two Eldritch Blasts and send one in each direction. Point both of them out. I will do it. That is 16 to hit. Not good. Can I bonus action Hex the second one? Before the other attack? Yeah. That'll at least help a little bit. 17. Big trouble! 17 didn't hit it. I'll come up on top of that platform and take a little bit of cover behind that-- Yeah. Just right there is good. I don't know what the fuck they do. Or a tactician! (nervous laughter) Four?! No evidence to support that. Stop rolling so many dice. Maybe we get the fuck out of here? That was a big hit. Three more? How about they fought in the last week and one of them is missing one? Like sharks in the wild and they've got battle damage, you know? Okay. That's terrible! Yeah, draw that. What do you mean "reel"?! These attacks are real! I don't know what these things are! Could you use your action, if she hadn't already? I'll use my 30 feet and I will come around that cover and I will run down to the-- That is a lot. Amazing. I will run up and take two swings with the Summer's Dance falchion against the stunned... That's amazing, okay. That is a 29 to hit. The second one is not as great. That is only a 19. Misses. Yeah. All right. Eight, 12-- oh, 1d6 for Hex. 15 points of slashing damage. I am going to use my bonus action and use Misty Step on the falchion to bamf back up on the platform. Yep. And that is my turn. Yasha would like to rage. She will rush the traffic cone from hell that is attacking Caduceus and Caleb and take two strikes with her Magician's Judge. Reckless attacks, please. I love barbarians so much. (counting) 13 times three is 39, right? Yeah, 39 points of slashing damage. Oh, times two, sorry, 26. Not times three, times two. 26. That's it, yeah. Oh no, sorry, rage is three. 29. It does. That hits. So hitting it doesn't make them drop the grapple. I was hoping that would be the case. Those circles are so great. Tentacles made of rock as well? Boom! Good call. Thank god he didn't take anybody with him. That Cobalt fighting style. Doo-bah! Yeah, straight roll. I'll run back up and take two swipes with the Summer's Dance falchion. Yeah, me too. First one is a 28, and the second one is a 29. Just straight. Nice. Ten plus four is 14 points of slashing damage, with four points of necrotic in there from the Hex. The second one is eight plus six, 14, plus five points of necrotic for 19 points of damage. Like a hero, I run up behind it and take inspiration from Beau, and I go (whoosh). Doo-bah! You're welcome. Yeah, let's book. Wait, who's-- yeah, we'll heal on the way. Actually, Yasha will run up to Caleb as we're running, and she will do Healing Touch because she never does that shit, to Caleb, and put-- what is it? Healing Hands, healing seven points. She never wastes an action on that. Is that what they're called? Like octopus. Oh. Let's go back and check that water. Can I walk up and touch it, and see if any of it moves or is different? Yeah, I'll start doing that. I'll do the same thing. I'll throw some Eldritch Blast at it. I'll move my Hex over onto it. 16 points of Eldritch damage. One of those hits. 21. No, sorry, 21 to hit. Before he fires, 19 points of damage, four necrotic. I don't know what that is, but I don't think you should use it no more. Two more Eldritch Blasts. Ooh, natural 20! Natural 20 and a 20. 13 points of Eldritch Blast on the first one, and 13 points on the second one. Man, that's so weird. No scoot! No! No! Yasha's pulling rocks. Fjord's pulling rocks. Not fast enough. Nobody knows what that is. Are you in the tunnels? Yeah, and there wasn't much of an ambush we could do anyway. It's one way in, one way out. We'll be fine. You know, if you're going to do those, maybe put some chimes behind them so you can be like a bell tower. Is "s'me" one word? "s" apostrophe m-e? Okay. She loves. I'm roughly counting, so I don't know. Nott, I have to say I've been feeling pretty bad hearing that you drowned previously. I want to apologize for making you face your fear over and over again. No, I've been giving you some shit, and as someone who has experienced the same thing, I commend you for your bravery. Yeah. That's cool, don't worry about it. Yeah. No, but thank you all the same. Oh, fucking balls. Wow, really? Now? It's super dark. Lives could be at jeopardy at any moment, and you want to trip? Yeah. Why do you do these things? Oh, crap. No. Constitution saving throw! Is there anything on the ceiling as I awkwardly stare up at it? Oh, I was kidding, but-- 17. Yes. Like on the sides, or--? Up in front of us? Man, I hate to interrupt, but you know, we have some divergent pathways ahead. Yeah. Hey, you want to send that cat of yours about 50 feet behind us? It looks like two of those had stuff pushed into it. That one looks like something came out of it. That one came into this one, though. After the big guy came through. Caduceus, go look up front! Jesus, god. Anything behind us? Why? Why a hammer? What, that we can be under the Ashkeeper Peaks and these are mining tunnels? I think we're dead under this mountain-peak, right? (counting) We're like (taps). Might as well see where this thing goes. We can keep going if we have to. There could be pigeons on the mountaintop. Is there another kind? Not helping. Do we have any real positives for going up? I honestly can't think of any. How far can Frumpkin go? How about just to that edge, then? Get it off! He can't hear us. My two cents I think they did a pretty good job of closing up these tunnels, right? Made it so that the average Joe or even someone able-bodied would be unable to follow them. I think this is probably the last place they think someone would come from. Above ground, pretty sure they're covered. They're small, right? They're small tunnels. Yeah, I mean, we're already dealing with the two-body-width tunnel as it is; I don't want to shrink it down any lower and really be fucked. Send the cat? I thought the cat went up the small tunnel. Yeah, let's send him up the small one. That's what I was thinking. I'll run up and push myself up against the wall, against where the tunnel is, just in case they decide to come out that way. Do we hear any movement coming from the tunnel? Yasha rolled a six. Fjord rolled a 15. I reach down and grab the spear and yank it out of its hands! What are you?! (yells) No! No, no! Oh, shit. Oh shit! What? [break] Rickymarooo! Bot username. Same page as you. Oh, good. This is my forte these days. 11. Fuck! That's so embarrassing! We should run. We should go. Just run forward. World of magic and mystery! Nice, Draconic! Deity! Upside down. How about the food? We have two gator skins in the bag of holding. Yeah. Are you interested in gator? It's like real tough leather. I mean, bet you could use it as some-- I know, yeah, it's so rare. I mean, maybe it's better we just hold onto the gator. I don't know. I mean, I could maybe part with one for the rest of us-- Well, all right. I pull out two gator skins. My friends will have to be able to go on their way. I mean, I hate to. They're worth a fortune and, boy, the protection that they yield, mmm dogie. Ah-- okay. Yeah. Wait, a path the big one? Ask them if they've been all the way to the end of the-- Have you been all the way to the end of big mess tunnel? Why not? Yeah, we ran forward. Yeah, what is in that cage? Are we going to pass judgment on this thing? Come on! Let's just keep going and turn a blind eye. I know where you're going with this. This is going to backfire. Yeah. Uh-huh. I don't think that's accurate. Shit. They're watching us leave. They're escorting us out. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. There you go. Is the dome out? Are we summoning the whole thing? I'm sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring at the dirt. You son of a bitch! You slow-playing son of a bitch. That was good. That was some bullshit. Not playing. This fucking-- Little scorpion on the end of the stick? Please hit. Yeah, best place. Jester, you killing them or what? You don't want to play with that. What'd he say? Sounded like there's something that shoots centipedes on me. (panicked screaming) (screaming) That was fucking terrible. Oh, no!TRAVIS,  (groans), MARISHA, MARISHA As fun as that was, you know, instead of killing this adorable little guy, maybe we could enlist him as a scout or guide? Stop! No, hey, hey! I think you'll have no trouble finding your way back. How far down this tunnel have you ventured before, Spurt? Oh, shit. Brave new world. Oh god, this is it! The swan song! Oh my god. We should keep going. (laughing) "It's dark down here." Not good, not good. Yes! Please have some real armor! Remember that number, kids. 28 points of bludgeoning damage. I run to the side of the cavern wall and lean up against it and shrink down. Shh! Shh! Holy fuck! 23, natural 20, 19, and Yasha rolled an 11. Is that the quickest we've ever had a player character come in and die? Yeah, we're pressed flush. Thank you, two natural 20s. Caleb, you ever read about anything like this? Yeah, crazy, dark-- oh, you have? No dark citadels? I mean, this is an accident, right? This isn't where we're trying to go. Yeah, we'll get back to that. How far from the opening of the tunnel that we're at, off to the left, are both of the fire giants? Natural 20. Got to love those Critical Role dice. You chaotic motherfucker. How much shit can I throw on one person? What is this? Where the fuck are we? I think diplomacy will be our best tactic. Let's use words. Yeah, it worked well before. And the other fire giant-- The second fire giant is on this side of the molten river of death? Uh-huh, one. That's a fire giant? I thought that was the citadel. Those are shields?! This the worst American Gladiators course ever. (laughter) Fire shield! Magma shield! What happens after they attack us in the bubble? Yeah, I don't know about the bubble thing. What if it breaks, what about when it expires? Non-fighting options I can take one person with me, 90 feet, in a single direction. I could create a false diversion that's a massive beast in the opposite direction of us or I could make a real beast. Oh, they both are? I have a suggestion. I can make a manticore appear, run from the cave and leap/fly over the river and carry off in the direction that is opposite of where we need to go. It sounds and looks like a real manticore, but if you make contact with it, it's just an illusion. So you can go invisible, you can go the entire distance, you're fast as balls. Caleb's fast as balls. I can take one person with me. With one person. Who's the odd man out? Who doesn't have a way to get over there real quick? How long is your speed? Nott, how do you feel about--- Sure, okay. Caleb, do you have a plan? To get across? I'm asking. I'm taking Caleb. You're running balls, you're invisible. 90 feet. It would be pretty close. We're going to send both of them in the opposite direction. Yeah. We don't do any of this until they fucking move away from where we need to go. Ready? Sure, sounds good, I like it. Here's the order. You're going to Polymorph Caduceus. You're going to go invisible and get started. I'm going to set the diversion and then we start going. I don't think so. You are doing that? LAURA and I turn to Yasha and say When I give you the signal, you and I are going to run towards the river of magma and hold on tight. But Nugget's like, in your pocket, right? Three, two, one. Get your head start, both of you. You're not just going to fly across the room by yourself? Beau and Nott, I'm going to give you 15 seconds before we start. It's your call. Are you going to trip? All right, fine. I will use Major Image and I will cast the image of a manticore climbing out of the magma river on this side of the bank, roaring at the fire giant and then leap, flying over to the other side. Visuals and sounds. Yeah, he comes out here, roars, and then jumps over. I think it's a 16. Shit. Where the hell is that on this thing? Anyone know where that is? Oh. 16. I'm not. If we run out of here are we-- How far is his melee, ten feet? Massive. We break out. Yasha and I run. 19. Yasha hates cows. Nine. Uh-huh. I need Yasha. (poofing) Fjord's going to run out and hug to the right, and he's going to head in this direction towards the magma river and go Yasha, come on! 30 feet, okay. That's it. Awesome. Yeah, and I will hold Thunder Step until Yasha is next to me. It does. Yeah, just popping. Yeah. Like a rock, or like a rock? Just wanted to check. Oh no. (explosion) Fjord just explodes. The second splat on the fucking ground. Oh, fuck. That definitely hits. Okay. Constitution check or saving throw? 20. That was going to be a plan ruiner for the second time. Bison, Buffalo? (mooing) (counting) (ramming) Bitch slap a cow. That hits. They got big-ass teeth. Another constitution saving throw? Okay, all right. Come on, come on. Natural 20. Next time, you specify dairy cow. Yasha will use 40 feet of movement to run past the cow to come into contact with Fjord. Does the cow get an attack of opportunity? I understand. Fjord summons the falchion and stabs it into the ground casting Thunder Step and will go 90 feet in the direction of the tunnel. It does. It does 3d10 thunder damage. I forgot about that. (counting) 20 points of thunder damage. Constitution 16. SAM and Actually, it takes 22 damage. Hey! All right. Super invisible, right? Take your time. Yeah, do it. You maintain? Just wait, just wait. Don't do anything yet. This is vengeance for the traffic cone guys. Yeah, I don't want to draw any more attention to the cave, because that's where he's got to go. I'm going to do nothing. That's my turn. You going to join me on the nope train? But my fake manticore is still flying around! Whatever that citadel is. We should go attack the citadel. What's your jumping distance? Negative. Nope train. Because of the level up? Oh my god. What is that citadel? (singing) If I could turn back time. TRAVIS and 9d10? (chanting) Ones! Ones! He's counting. You're unconscious. 18d10? What is the matter with you, Perkins? Didn't you know this moment was coming when you made those rules?! I get that lava is dangerous, but fuck! That was amazing. What are you talking about? We're fine. Kill that fire giant with your duplicity. Kick him in the shin. No, Caleb can walk his happy ass inside. No, Fjord is doing nothing. Fjord's doing nothing. I thought you put it out? Oh yeah, I will run over and pat the fire out. Yeah. You good? Yasha will put her hand on Fjord and hit healing hands, giving him seven hit points and yell to Caleb Caleb! Five feet is not enough. We must keep running. Must go faster. Holy shit. Fuck you and your magma damage. 18d8. Oh my god.
