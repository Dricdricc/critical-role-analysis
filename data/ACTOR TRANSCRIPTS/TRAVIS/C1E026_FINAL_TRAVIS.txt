I like cheese. You don't think? We should totally check on them! I think he's lying. Do I feel a little tingle from my belt? And can I roll for a beard check? Six. Two. You know the remedy for it, you just turn your face in the looking glass. My god, I'm so handsome. Right? And then just horror. Sheer horror. I would shave it and get it even, but let's be honest, given history, it's going to take care of itself soon enough. These things don't live very long. (singing) They're going to be getting it on! Did you check for traps? No, she's in Percy's room! Scanlan, let's go see if he's banging! (boom) Right. I think it's the previous. Yeah. Probably. My room's like shit, and I'm not in trouble. I boost him up. Is he naked? Oh. I get it. Like a madman? I drop Scanlan and I lean in and I go, beware the water! It burns! Cock! Bulls! Dong! Wang! Donkey wang! It's a good line. What do you think? Maybe his soul is forfeit. Death? Nope. No. Total massacre. It was pretty great! She did have that sweet little run, which was so cute. She actually didn't do anything, either. She could have been taking notes. Oh yeah, what time is it? Do you want to tell us what you've learned? What? Your items? Yeah, thank you. You healed my cask. I'll always be grateful. I think that sounds right. It's that many. I like the way you kill people. Yeah! Yeah, they are! Is it too early to start drinking? I pull out the cask of ale. What's the word? Minxie! I go and give a little scratch behind the ears. What a dick! We go to see Uriel. I made a choice for the team! (laughter) 18. And if you're wondering how we know they're vampires-- (whispering) Vax, this is your cue. Can you read my mind? I turn to the guards that were grabbing at their weapons and I flex real fast at them and then I walk. Bitch! (laughter) You're going to get six belts thrown at you. Could we wait outside for Allura? Really? Or maybe we have to bring proof of their vampirism back? Oh. To bring back proof of them being vampires. She fled, went unconscious, then we butchered her. If we came back with proof? What sort of artifact? Like, a brooch? A handbag? Oh, that's the worst! I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed. Ugh! Yeah. She's telling the truth. Let's go make sure the prisoner isn't dead. Oh come on! You half-elves. I swear to god! Have you never heard of lying before? Yeah! We don't tell them where we're going. We're going on a field trip. We're going to pick berries. Fuck all, but we go there. What? And we're going there, what for? Why don't we say we're taking a picnic-- oh, we took a wrong turn. Hey, it's the Briarwoods! We don't have to if we don't want to. It's a full beard right now. I just noticed that! Yeah, I want to be there when we talk to the prisoner, too. How far away from the keep are we? I whistle really loud and say, who are these fucks in front of the keep? to the guard that we have employed. Right. We'll be the judge of that. As you were. Favored enemy! Mr. and Mrs. Kraut, as friends of the elderly-- Right, Kraut. Do they normally come at night, or have they ever abducted any of your sweet bulls during the day? Travel safe, Mr. Kraut! Yeah, let's get fucking in there and talk to that little-- The Krauts? You know, somebody's been to the Feywild. 50? Come on! There's always a first time. I reach into the Bag of Holding. I pull out the little goblet, and I pour some ale into a cup, and I hand him a little bit of ale. No, it's fine. I take a little sip. All right. I put it beside him. We've stood before them, and we did not fall. You'll get every consideration for protection. We value your info very much. Not a problem. Keep the goblet nearby. It is very nice ale. Aw, shit. (laughter) Not a problem. Is there any other entrance to the cell area besides the door? No barred windows or anything like that? You can't cast any kind of alarm system? A trigger? We should. We have five or six. No, not Cordell. Let's get somebody else. I like him! I come out from the castle into the courtyard, and I go, hey! I feel like chicken tonight! Can we go hunt this big bird? Really? Are you sure you didn't hit him with the blunt side of your knife again? Yeah. Smart. Keyleth! Tibs got turnt up. Will you fix it? Grog is riveted. No, we're not in the prison. We're out in the courtyard. I grab Tiberius's mouth and I cover it. Please continue. I think so, too. Percy's here and so are five? Six? How many employees do we have? Why don't you make some extra bears that don't hate us? Why don't you make some extra bears that don't hate us? What time is it? So it's 300 in the afternoon. The bird doesn't even come until night. We could let him wear it off. Yeah! That won't freak him out at all. Yep? Lead with that next time. That's awesome! Don't vampires hate fire? Can you do fire? He's drunk! He won't remember anything. I have one of those. Yeah. It's a jewel that's red and palm-sized. I cover Tiberius's mouth again. It's a palm-sized ruby. Yeah, I got a big palm! Do we think they're going to come while we do this? Do we want to waste it? Because that's an awesome outside defense. Do we want to waste it for this? What if they're coming? Does it cost one jewel per-- Maybe we should save that, because that's awesome! Keyleth, I like that. I think we should keep it in case there is an actual attack coming. Because it might just, 24 hours and then we waste it. Nobody came. And we take the scenic route to let him walk it off as we head up towards Big Bird's house. We love old people. That'll be all we need. We head out to the pasture. Aye. Have you managed to hit it with your crossbow? I've heard that those giant birds are attracted to red-headed, 19-year-old, scruffy-chin folk with crossbows. Awesome. 22. We went from all cows to pretty much no one is a cow. How do you come out of being a cow, if you are one? You would do it? Let's do it! When else are we all going to be cows? Come on! Unless it kills them instantly, we'll be fine. Cow or no, Keyleth? Give us your answer. We want to get in the pen first, right? Sure! You've earned it. (laughter) Super loose. What if that was attraction? Just go along. Go along. We are "cow-nsel" worthy. Because nothing is happening I am now trying to eat grass. We are in it, baby! Pour a little out. What was that? I go into a cow rage and start chewing faster. 18. I take the Firebrand Warhammer, activate it, turn on the fire. And I put the Chain of Returning on it and throw it at the winged beast. 15. Nope. 16. Can I pull it back? What is this? There's a nest. 14. Big-ass tree fortress. You could go in. What part of the flying part did you forget? Are we going to lose Fly, or do we keep it? I'm going in. Hoof in hoof. Three. Three. How far away are we now? So we're within 60 feet? Okay. I yell out, you've been stealing the farmers' livestock. Give us a reason not to kill you. Somebody talk to him before I kill this fucking bird. That's a young'un? To Vasselheim. Can we kill this thing now? You guys are doing awesome. It's across the sea. They're huge, right? We'll take them. We'll put them out there. Stake them. The sun rose, right? Can I make a beard check? (laughter) Two, zero. What happens to the existing side? Perspiration was happening. Bad for us? Squadron of cows.
