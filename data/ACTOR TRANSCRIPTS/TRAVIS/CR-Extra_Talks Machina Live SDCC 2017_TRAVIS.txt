It is like an elementary school chair. Eyeballs! They're loaded with LSD. Do not eat them! We'll be tripping balls. Thank you! Excited about that. The world opens up. I think it was when Keyleth exploded as a goldfish. (cheering, applause) Might be a straight line-- It's a free-for-all. I'm pretty sure Grog would want to come back as anything with breasts. (laughter) He'd never leave his room. (laughter) Let me know when you get back! You broke Laura! Behind the boathouse. Come alone. You're writing all this down, right? Can we pick Pelor, like, the Dawnfather? Word. That's true. I'd pick the werewolf, because as soon as he started to die, I'd be like, bite me, dude. Just bite me. You just keep healing me, we'll just keep smashing them? Yeah. Like Overwatch tag-team. Those are actually all on my playlist. These are the songs. (laughter) Always learning. (laughter) Yeah, can we?! Please?! I want it! (Grog voice) I'm grateful for, um. Ale. And my buddy Pike. And my friends. Also, ale. (cackles) (laughter) And all will worship me! So great. Commerce? Stand up, Gil, Jesus! 16-bit? Yeah, I think you're forgetting about the amazing 16-bit JRPG Jurassic Park. I love that one, on the Gameboy? Electricity would be really interesting. Excuse me. I was surprised Grog became the smartest member of the group. (cheering) That's insane because we live ten, 15 minutes from you guys and we do the same shit. We have our own Taco Bell. I'm like, "why did you take my Deck of Many Things, Laura?!" You don't know. He's going to fold one of these times.
