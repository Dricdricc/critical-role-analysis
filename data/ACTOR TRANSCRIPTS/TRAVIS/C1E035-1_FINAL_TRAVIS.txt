Pan Me? And they will poop in your box for the delivery. No promises, you guys. No. You can't do any better that. Subdued and arrogant. Was that "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" We'll never know. Damn it, we should have done that check last time. "Can we check for citric acid?" "You can certainly try." (laughter) She rolled that natural 20 that kept her from probably getting sucked into Uranus. And Lady Briarwood is manacled. Fuck them. We keep running. We're trying to get out of the area, right? Yes? Oh, sorry. Yeah, fuck it. It's like carrying coats. Hold on. So I put one in each arm. There you go. Yeah, we're trying to get out of here as fast as we can. How are you feeling? (laughs) I didn't even know she was gone! Yeah. Let me know when we leave that big-ass room that the ziggurat is in. We're still in it, right? I remember the tunnels sucking booby-trap-wise. Can I check for traps as I go? Yeah. Normal Saturday night, my friend. Okay. That's good. 24. I fucking hate doors. Don't we all? It's the danger area. You're out. One point. Can't you heal some people? I have potions, too, but-- Yeah, we're out of the room. I have a common. Can I try giving Vex a common healing potion? I fucking drop Lady Briarwood on her face, hard. Please work. And it stays? It works? Oh, good. That took. Can you heal people? It's a yes or no question. Still pretty low. I feel like we should heal you up just a touch more. What are you at? That's pretty fucking low. I have one. She can have mine. Yeah, I'm a giant. You'd better roll strong. Oh, he did just give you a potion. Sounds like a challenge! How did it go? Did you kill the little black thing of death? Vex gave Scanlan a gun. I don't think it's loaded. Is it moving at all? What about all the bodies in the room? Are they still like, (moans)? I'm beautiful again! That's right. Can you heal a couple of people? Yeah, wait, stabilize her first. I have some really dirty rags. Could I do a medicine check and try and stabilize her bleeding? 18! Zero! Or other things. Okay, and then I take her by the foot and I drag her on her face away from the group. Very gently, but still by her foot. Oh right, yeah, she talks that shit, doesn't she? I know, right? Shit! Life! LAURA and We love them! Can I tear a piece of fabric off of one of the three remaining fancy robes and I tie it around Lady Briarwood's mouth? But like-- (muffled) in, and you know like (muffled) in the teeth all-- she can't really enunciate. (yelps) Shit, she's awake! SAM and I slap her. 21. If you're curious, she's still alive. I did bandages on her real good. You betrayed some bitches, that's what you did. (jokingly) Natural 20. (laughter) Yes, the whispers! This is the pre-show days! It's been a long time. We used to play-- don't over-listen to it! I've got a question. Do you care if I smash the shit out of Lady Briarwood's head now? Hush! Unarmed? She tried to kill us. Who's he talking to? All right? I take out my hammer... I'm ready! Oh. Fine! (punching sound) 19. They're not pointy, right? Hold on a second. Are you sure you don't want to smoke this bitch? Shit! Just change the subject. You did! Yes, you did. We were trying to answer you for a little bit. She almost killed Vex, she didn't kill Vax, we've got to do fucking something with her. You got a whisper?! Whispers! For the record, I like the shadow stuff. Didn't get sufficient tongue in yours? (yelling) Shut the fuck up! What the-- what?! Off of him. The smoke dissipates or goes behind him? Oh, we're great, we're fine, we're good. Yeah, we do! We've got Pike! I've been standing in front of Lady Briarwood. Yeah, I was in front of Lady Briarwood, though. 17. Oh, sorry, did I miss that section? You're using Briarwood's rapier? Right. 16. Don't dap me for hitting Scanlan! Oh shit. 19? "You know what? You're right! He is no hollaback gnome." I would like to rage. And move in front of the rest of the group. I put my back to the rest of the group. Yeah. I did? I don't remember that. Yeah! I would like to do that. When he reappears. Yeah, when I can see him with my beautiful eyes. We can't see him right now, though. She runs? Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to light it up with my flaming war hammer. I turn and I swing at it. Hey, that's good. 28? 26. Nice. Oh, is it still covered in the holy oil? 21 for the first one. With the radiant, fiery damage. Fuck yes! 19, 20, 21. 22! Guiding Bolt. It farts a little cloud of smoke. Yeah, it is. It does? (grunts) I want to hit it again! Do I have advantage? Faerie Fire. That's better. 24. The second one is... 21. Nice. First one is 15. 18. I'll stay where I am. Ah! So close. 19. (laughing) Please. Please be enough. (laughing) You're too mean. We didn't bind her? Well, she got out of her manacles. Son of a bitch, we left her alive. I'm fucking pissed. 12. Yes! Three and a four. 13. What? What did I do? With advantage? Natural 20. First roll. Don't even need to do it again. (muttering) 20, 21, 22. (louder) 31 total. I'd like to pick up the hammer and slam him down to the ground just so he's at Trinket's head height.
