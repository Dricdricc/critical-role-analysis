Can we keep these? Yay! These will stink in a week. Oh, we're not in character yet, right? I miss you too. Yeah, bring a bathing suit, I hear there's a pool party on Saturdays in the negative-two-degree weather. I don't know. It's Milwaukee. But we're not gonna see you. (laughter) It could've been worse. Can I see it? What, really? (gasps) I'll have it. The hammer. There's a hammer? What? Who found a warhammer? I was asleep. What if I've got a dwarvish beard? I'm so happy right now. Huh? What was the question? Sorry, I'm drooling all over this-- It's pretty fucking close. Apparently I throw it, it comes right back to my hand. If I had Frenzied Rage and three attacks, would it go (whack whack whack) like a giant yo-yo? (hyperventilates) I'm taking this one. 60 feet. Son of a bitch. What if I did Reckless Attack? I love you right now. If these two tables weren't in our way... Mayonnaise. I would like to attune to this. Yes. Not the Blood Axe. I must think. Okay. Female setting! Ow. (laughter) That really hurt, and it's still hurting. Square. What happened? Oh no. I don't have a problem with that, I do have a problem with the headache. Can we maybe bargain to get the headache removed? 'Cause I'm really-- I need BC Powder. Stupid sword. Jeez, me and swords. Just really not doing well. What'd she say? I do. Do you have anything to help with it? I'm not wounded, it's just a headache. Do you have Cure Headache? I don't know, it's out of my league. I mean, maybe, yeah. It's only a headache. I'll be fine. Yeah, we all just healed, I'm fine. All right, yeah, I will. Thank you, Pike. We're gonna kick some ass. Oh, down two. That's... I'm not a real big jewelry fan. Do I have to attune to it? Nah, I don't want it. Thank you, though, Keyleth, that's very sweet. Did it do anything for my gas? Son of a bitch. I don't know where it would have gone. Yeah, no, we do! Assisting D&D games since 2000-something. Why're we having a Feast? Are we going to fight something? That's right. I feel terrible for not realizing that. Unless she's in, like, perma-bubble-bath world or something. I'm not. -2, playas. I do miss my salt lick rock. Can I keep an eye out as we walk around for another salt lick rock? Don't make me do that. Ooh! 13. Find your own! Is it close to salty? Could I confuse it with salt? More shiny than the others? I am a great sorcerer. I will keep this new stone. Palm-sized? Bag of Holding, you've got new occupants. Oh my god! Yes. I love camping. That don't match at all. Sing me a song. Sing me a song right now. Don't ever say the word. That was amazing. Does it look like fire damage or something else? Yeah! Stand back. 11 minus two. Someone peed on these trees. All of 'em. In a big circle. Like that. Is that not normal? Not ashamed. These trees aren't alive. 13. Yep. Yep. Can I push him in? No, I'm kidding. Why? Like good magic? What kind of bad magic? I really don't want another one of those. Seriously. Today's kids do not appreciate quicksand. I take one of my new salt lick rocks and I throw it in one of the little sandy pools. Ooh, magic, huh? Real scary. I have a psychic connection with my rocks. I actually did that. It's magic. Don't step there. You know what Gilmore would do. Put his hand in it. Got you a water, Matt. Do we want to take the first entrance that we find, I mean, is it really one way in, one way out? What if it's just, like, a trap? I mean, like, run a perimeter, do any recon, anything else? Fuck that, death first, open the door. Yeah, we're doing it. Do you have a headache too? Oh my god, we're all gonna die. I'm patient zero. Wait, actually, can I pull Vex aside real quick? Can I talk to you just real fast before we-- Yeah, like a little further away, like in private? No, I know. I hate to beat a dead bush. Horse? Cow? I hate to beat a dead cow, but I really did like that little magic thing I found. When we were looting and stuff? And I've been really worried about you. I know you like to bargain, right? So I thought I could trade you back for what I found. And I have this little Parapet of Wound Closure, you've been dying so much, right? And if you wear this and you die, you immediately stabilize on your next turn. I figured it'd be a good trade. No. It's a big word. I don't really know what you're saying. I really liked it. I mean, it made a magic sword when I touched it. Yeah, but I can deal with a headache. I won't-- I just, I found it, you know? What? Look, you won't die, you won't die. It's only 'cause I'm looking out for you. Okay. Yeah, I don't look at anything, I keep it in its little pouch, I don't pull anything. I promise. You want to trade? Okay, there. I take the cards. Six. To not look at them. All right. Thank you, Vex. That really means the world. I know, they're really special. I won't look at them or anything. That means a lot. I don't find a lot of great things. I did find a couple rocks, earlier, if you want them. Okay. Are you sure? You're not gonna try and steal that shit, too? Cool. Let's go kill a dragon. And I jauntily and cheerily walk back to the group. (laughter) So happy to be reunited. For a door? We don't have to spend anything. I'll just beat the shit out of it. I do, yeah. I actually have those, like, no one's taken them from me. (laughter) I just mean, like, they're mine, you know. They work for me, they speak to me. Yeah. I try to work on it at night. Can you fast-forward 1000 years? We looked for a switch, right? Can I look for a switch? If I solve this... 19. Oh, minus... 17. I don't know what that is, but I will assault this stone with a quickness. There's no joy in either of them. Kima. You ask Kima for the Holy Avenger, I'm not taking that. You ask Kima for her sword. See how that goes. Thank god. 23. Plus ten? 28. No, sorry. Oh, 30. You know, you could put that out and they could just grab onto each one of our arms and move forward. Oh, jeez. Hey, Kerr, you wanna cuddle? Hey, Vax. Put that light out. I love it. I love it! I have no idea. Well, fuck, I'm sorry, it's just not a priority for me, all right? (laughter) Can I look to the left, just off him saying that, because of the Belt of Dwarvenkind I have Darkvision? I start to slowly make my way over to the skull. Is this the direction? Are we getting warmer? What does the skull look like? Anything shiny about it, or jewelled? Candles look like candles? Kerr, I hate to rain on your parade, but I only see two candles and a human skull up here. All right. I grab the skull and hand it to Kerr. No, I do not mind at all, thank god there's someone else in this world with my sort of thinking. Hold on. I grab my earring, and I say, Kerr found a human skull that has some undead vibes vibrating out of it. But it's not doing anything. Do you mind if we destroy it? Yeah. I mean, we can leave it alone. Hey, Kerr, they're worried we're gonna kill ourselves. Can you just put it back, but face it towards the wall like it's in time out? Vex-agonal shaped. 16. Can I look for invisible dragons? No, I'm kidding. I can do that. Is it made of skin? Yes. Is there still tinder under the-- Are you about to die right now? (chanting) Grab it, grab it, grab it. How's it feel? Yeah. Yeah? Maybe if you put something in the pot and set it on fire, by that light, you'll-- I did, but everything's really, really bright right now. I've just got the lit-up shapes of a bunch of people going like that. Who cares about books? No fucking way. Does what? Oh. Can't we just knock it down? They're worth 7000 gold each. How far is it to the door? I walk over to the door. Can I-- would you mind-- Flaming skulls? Jesus. 25 to 20. Me. 14. What'd Pike roll? What happened when he hit 'em with those daggers? Did you stick cotton in your ears during the break? Fuck. Like, where else were we gonna go? It's a huge explosion. God damn it, that's the same number. These little disembodied bastards are tough. What are these called? I failed the first two, succeeded on the second two. Ten, ten, 21, 21. You said 72. Should I have taken more? I failed two. We're in a fucking kill box. These are not living creatures, though, right? Flaming jungle mob? Doesn't affect my rolls. Still didn't make it, though. Ten, ten, 21, 21. Hey! So if you saved on all of them, how many points of damage would you take? Got it, 56. Thank you, Kerr! Percy, does that end your turn? (yells) I run at the last remaining skull. In a rage. I'd like to play teeball, please. With this new Dwarven Thrower. Should've tried throwing it, but too late for that. With reckless, great weapon master, please. 33 minus five is 28? Right. Shit, wait. Yeah. 26. No, I'm sorry, the second hit was 26 to hit. I didn't do it yet. Now I've done it. What the fuck is that? I know. That's a six, plus-- I'm raging, so 20 points of damage. 19. I don't have a third attack. With a bonus action, can I attempt to use my Boots of Feral Leaping and leap... (laughter) Damn you, watcher of all things! Flatline. Not like this. I just want to leap towards the wall that way so I'm not in the same line. Oh, cool. I don't need it, it's 26. I expected you to die! I forgot to add ten. I mean, you can add 20. Sorry. She got it! We came from that way, right? Can I run that way? We came from the other way. I run the other way. (braking noises) How many of those did you fail? Oh. You're at half your hit points? Yeah, let's just use our hit dice, save the big heals. We haven't even fought the dragon yet. Nine times a day, playa. I got a 12 right there, that's fucking sweet. Do we go back up to Heroes' Feast hit points, or not anymore? I heal 55 hit points with this d12 monster. I'm just one below where I was. 235. Oh, you're doing great! That's great. We're missing the high soprano tonal quality. A number, give him a number. Save it. After. Yeah, except I had it all under control. Patrick, how much did you heal, brother? I'm more than 450, so. Pretty sure we should just take the stairs. I'm game. That was good! On the carpet? I'm ready? Just me, I think. What do you think? Me and Allura, or just me? Who else is left up top? Is it just me and Keyleth? Okay. First, I stand on the carpet. I say, lift! No, I lay down flat. And I grab the edges of the carpet, and I go, okay! And try to go down. Stop, stop, stop! Yeah, baby! I'll be behind the twins. We should just use that. (laughs) You bastard. Are you literally going to run? Oh. So you're gonna make a walk for it. I don't know why-- what is 'retort'? Okay. Marisha, that was really nice. I'm gonna jump. Yeah, do I twist in the air? Such a bonus, huh? Such a bonus. Look at Matt's face. Look at his face. War God's Blessing? Do what you're gonna do, Mercer. I can't get on the rug, so one of you lighter people, will you go get those two, please? But why would you do that, because you've gotta put two people on that carpet? We're trying to put them on the carpet, right? You know, if you get hit by something that falls. Yeah, we're just kind of watching the fucking show. I think we just leave 'em. I had a question. So I take one of my five empty jugs out of the Bag of Holding, and I go to the edge. While they were up there doing all that shit. I look down and I just throw it straight down as hard as I can. Does it immediately go whoop? Right, so if you did a jump. I will pull you all into the chasm. Can't somebody fly the carpet back over and then-- can't Pike fly it back over, and then she and Scanlan can bamf over, and then I can just try and make it across with the carpet. Yeah. And then what? It is somewhere. Doesn't have a range. Sure, I'm down with that, 30 feet. No, I'm not attuned to that. I've got the little hammer now. Oh, sorry, the hammer, yes. How far across the chasm is the thing? I mean, I can essentially attach it to anything, I think. No. Sure. That really seemed very easy. I don't see what the big deal was. (laughter) It's going up, but we're not. What's on the ceiling? Just flat? 16. Well, we could pour a bunch of water in the fountain. Oh, I just meant pour water out of the alchemy jug. I do. What do you want for it? What you got for trade? (laughter) Is that an ascot you're wearing? I'll take that. I don't care. I want it. I want to be dignified. Here's your jug. How high is the ceiling? Okay. We don't wanna pour anything into the fountain? We did nothing to this thing that's right here, magically pouring water out. I love buttons. I just feel like, I don't know, nothing more sad than an empty fountain. Well, yeah, I feel like that's what a fountain does. I mean, like, if you came across an empty fountain, kind of a worthless thing. I dunno. Yeah, kinda. Allura, it's just an empty fountain, right? It's gotta have a purpose. I never really get that far. Allura, you're all smart with magic and stuff. Why is this horribly terrified face giving water upwards on an emerald in the ceiling? Yeah, okay. What do you want for it? We are running towards Vax and Vex. That was so white. That was amazing. So white. Piano riff! To the right or the left?
