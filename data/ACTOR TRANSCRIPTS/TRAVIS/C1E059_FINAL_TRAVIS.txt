One, two, three. (anime reactions) Biggest Dragon Ball Z fan in the world. Fullmetal Alchemist transmutation circle! Shut up, Liam. You're not here! This is going in the kitchen in front of the sink. I'm going to stand on it and transmute my dishes into clean. What a goober. Which brings us to our next announcement, which is we do have a live show next week! (cheering) I'm gonna sit in a sock, and that's it. It's the first of hopefully many, so we'll see how it goes. We must reiterate, they are gorgeous. You will want one of these for you or your friends. I feel like we got drugged. Is anyone else seeing the colors and the shapes and the-- First roll of the day. Don't fuck it up. We can always let them go first and they die, and then we go. Oh, fuck those pieces of bait. Are there a lot of pastel colors all over the place? Okay, so not crazy LSD colors going. Is it dusk? What does that mean? Nothing is what it seems. "As you" always means doom. Wow. We've been here five minutes. I don't see what the big deal is, really. Really? Yeah. How many fingers am I holding up? He's a liar! He can see fine. Piece of shit. No. (laughter) Where? Hold on. Did you hear that? What? I don't know. Maybe. Well, she didn't blind me. That's none of your business. I don't know. My chick didn't blind me, so if she did, I think we need to kill her. I'm sorry, I need to be more sensitive-- look out, it's a parrot! And I kick the sword. Yeah, there are rabid parrots out here in the Feywild. Oh, you know what? Just go pick it up. (laughter) All right. So wait, can we be clear? You picked a flower, all the trees got pissed off, you went blind, some naked chick jumped a wall, and that's the story of what's happened so far? We are killing it right now. I feel like maybe we need a change in leadership. Just saying. Yeah. Vax? Can you get a pair of eyes on her without going blind? What? Go look for her? All right. Fuck it. No. And I do a full vault over the wall. Can I stick my fingers in the mud. Does it smell weird? I wipe it across my chest. Do I see any footprints from where naked chick went? What? She left no traces! Does anyone want to come with me to the water? You're not going anywhere! All right. I cautiously make my way down. How far is the water? Can I see it from where I am now? All right, I'll stealthily make my way ten feet towards it. Son of a bitch. I did. 17. Can I call out hello? Nothing? Can I reach in the Bag of Holding and grab a basilisk egg? And can I try to launch it as far as I can into the pool? 23. Oh! I saw a hand! No, I'm not like Ray Charles. I can't tell if someone's attractive just by their hands. Yeah? You want me to put my body in there? What if there's more than one her? Yeah, but there were these invisible steps, right? I feel like we walked up some steps and then there was a portal. And she came out first! It wasn't like I went to her apartment and I was like Hey! Want to hook up? Does this look like the pool I came into on the other side? 11. Similar? No! Did she have a name? Her name was Nymph! O Nymph! Where thee art thou? Oh shit! Seven. Okay. Well, you've got to come closer, though. Oh yeah, we got earrings. MARISHA and O Nymph! Hear my ball! Call! Once, we spent an afternoon together. The sun never shone brighter! The clouds were never quite as fluffy! Oh. That was too much. SAM and That's right, my lady. Forgive me, your beauty has wiped my mind. Your name was? Nala. I shan't forget again. Buddy! What the fuck did you just do? Yeah, she went back underwater. Wait, do me a favor. Look, maybe everybody take a knee and be real chill while I throw down this swag, all right? I was on fleek and now I'm on flock. Nala, it is a friend, not a foe. She's with me, and a great ally of ours. As you know, my lady, of course I do. Oh! Right. An actual-- No, I don't. We needed it for something. Yeah, so when last I saw you, I had this horrible bunk in my chest? It was terrible. And in combination with your heart, I was able to remove it and prolong my life. Which means I'm here. It did, thank you. Many, many thanks. And you have our apologies again for beheading one of your flowers and for making all the loud snapping noises. This is not the way we wanted to start, believe me. If I might ask, old bleachy-hair over here took a look at your beauty and all of a sudden went (raspberry) and can't see anything. Nope, he's blind forever. Yeah, totally cool. We're going to put some Braille on your gun. You said it's been very calm around here. No unexpected visitors or commotions lately? May I introduce to you Vex'halia? Yeah, that's right. I forget. She's seeking something in this place. Nala, I'm sorry. I'm very simple. Is duskward actually west? Are you controlling the way the trees move? Yes. It's very impressive. She's so sweet. As we make our way towards this area, is there anything that you would warn us of? Oh. Everything. Hands in the pocket policy going forward? Before we leave, is there anything we might bring you on our way back through here, should we be successful? Books? My kind of books? Pictures? Markup's a bitch. No, I definitely don't need it. I'm good. Who's all tender? You got wood. Yes! Oh my god. Holy shit. It was a true joy seeing you again. We'll try to bring ourselves by this way on our way out as we can. Well, wish us luck. I bow to her before I leave. (pointedly) I bow before we leave. What? I what? What's wrong with your mouth? Population? No. There's no population in that. I think it's just her in that. Gross. While the children play, I make my way towards the dusk direction. Is there any rocks or debris or little pebbles around on the ground? I'll take a small pebble. Pike, you really should do what you can to help Percy. And I toss the pebble at his face. (laughter) Maybe it's temporary. No, I mean the blind part. Let's try it, then. It's masterful. Nice. 19. Natural 19. All right, let's keep going, then. What? Are you sure you really saw something? You kill me. Oh man, who would want to miss this? Hey, buddy. Do you want to keep staying down there doing the breaststroke? Yeah! And you're the point of access. I think the whole thing is fucking weird. We've been walking this whole time. Well, hold on. Can I spin around and see if the grass we've been trampling on is leaving a trail? Is anything following us? A deathly eight. Nothing. We're good! We're clear. Team monster! We're fine. Let's keep grooving. Sun's up. We checked it out. We're solid. Something's on fire. Yeah! Definitely nothing here. What's around us? Grass fields, pretty much? Far as you can see? Yeah. Let's set up shop, drop. I love it. What is this? What are you? With one of my fingers, can I give him a little tickle? Please be nudie pictures. What do you see? What's it a picture of? Has he drawn us? What other goliath has been tromping through this place? Do you have any family? Friends? I'm just saying, is there anyone that would miss you if you're gone? What? Yeah. Crack out the door, homie. (sneezes) I sneeze right in his face. You didn't miss anything. It moved super fucking slow. I stand at the door like a sentry. We're not in the Feywild. We're in the house. Would you care for any ale? All right. I crack out the big-ass cask of ale. Well, all right, Tiny Toons. Nicely done. I give the satyr another drink. Keyleth! You're so touchy today. Is he looking any more drunk? Yeah, fine. I think you should know that this door that you walked through in this big house, if you steal anything, it shreds you into ribbons when you leave. Fuck. Six. Your glass is looking empty. If you want your book back. How far from here would you say it is? He's been very helpful. Maybe he could just point us in the direction. Borrowing them indefinitely. Do I get to grab him again? But you're usually so picky about details. What if he asks us to steal somebody? All right. Fine. Don't forget about all them ales, yeah? At least you can always draw. Don't give him that, Vax. It's too nice! How many fingers am I holding up? Yeah, take it off! Give it a minute. It might take a while to take effect. Maybe do some jumping jacks. Don't let him steal any of our shit. No, I mean our personal shit. Yeah, but what if he can do Scanlan's thing where he goes through the door? She's fine. It was a draft. She needs to wear more clothes. It's all right. I'll go to bed. And I sleep on all of my weapons and stuff. They're under me, on top of the mattress. Creepy, unconsented petting farm. You are? Yeah. Did you fuck us? I think he wants a beating. That's what he wants. Why would you do that when we've been so hospitable? I guess I don't mind. At least I'm big. You got charmed? Well, might as well. Is this your first performance check? So I'm curious. While we're eating, would you happen to tell us what our first objective might be? Yeah, I'm full. I don't have fancy robes. I do have your fancy winter stuff. All right, Keyleth gets a cloak. Do you want some nice shit? Everybody or just the twins? Can I reach down to where he was? Clever little spider monkey. Poon! Oh shit. At the live show. Vessar twins? Thank you to Loot Crate. One day left for Joe Mad. Yay Ashley!
