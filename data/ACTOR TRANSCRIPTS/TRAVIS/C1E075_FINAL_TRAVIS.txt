False start, offense. (ke-thunk) (ke-kunk, ke-kunk, ke-kunk, ke-kunk) (glass shattering) (vacuum noises) Holy shit. It keeps getting better. The photoshoot is still TBD. Yes! Look at the jaw, it's so forced. Gross. Gross. You're in different parts of the song. Go watch American Tail and Land Before Time. Forge? Yeah, for you? Shitloads. Sorry. That was hot. (laughter) Do we have a safety word? (weakly) Oklahoma. (laughter) I'm a master of a good burn. Does that give me fire resistance? I'm very familiar with that. Yeah. In the ground or raised or--? With like big-ass scorpion tails? Those that are walkin' around that don't like have a bodyguard and don't seem to be enslaved, are they still wearing that white and gold cloak-y thing that our strange bit is wearing? Really? Hey, man. Is she picking your nose? Why are you talking to us like that? I'm wounded! I've been gashed open! It's dangerous to keep a race car at a red, I'm just saying, I'm a race car at a fucking red. Pulp Fiction! Have you spoken with a fire giant before? So weird. Are they good conversationalists? Maybe he's got beef with somebody in the city and we'll go out and jack 'em up if he'll tell us where-- It's a suit of armor, though. Was it 1000 feet? Radius. What do they construct? Right. Yeah. So, like, wheels? Or like weapons? Arms? You said arms. I have a hard time listening when you talk like that. It might help, you know-- Yeah. Has he heard of the Dawnmartyr? And maybe he didn't win it, but has he seen it, heard of it-- Question two. Does he know where it may be? And question three, if he doesn't want to tell us where, is there someone that he has an errand that he need run in exchange for-- (singing) Hey maybe now we've got-- Yeah, that's three! Has he heard of them, does he know where it is and if he won't tell us, does he need an errand run, and Suutan bloodline. (coughs) Jewels. They're just normal weapons. There's a Greatsword of Frenzy, but-- Oh! My war mask! My war helmet. It's crafted, though. It's like-- It's inscripted. It's got my title on the inside. Don't fucking-- don't even. Got to feed those forges with something! What about the Alchemy Jug? Which we have used-- what? Choker? Did you offer the fire giant a fucking choker? Arms, arms! God bless you. Vax, give him all of your Vestiges! (laughter) What about the black sapphire? Leave it. 40 pounds of white dragonhide. Use your legs. Bend the knees. Do you want me to? C'mon, Beast Mode! She's touched. Just don't worry about her. You're not going to fist-bump, or anything? How heavy is that thing? You guys are doing a great job with that, really. No you go first, you go first. Turn it over! (whispers) Weird. (choking noise) Why? What's in the embassy? Right. Nine. That's a lot. Senokir, did that exchange go about the way you thought it would? Good. Do I know if giants have any natural enemies that they hate? Did he say that Sugan, being the brains of the two, enslaved other giants? I think you might have to play him in a game of cards. SAM and (singing) You're a hustler, baby! You did so good, though. Oh, fair fire giant! Fair? Hammering at an anvil. 20 feet tall. Oh, fair, gentle fire giant! Do we do the spell when we get up there, or now? Can't Vax do some Spider-Man shit and check out the windows? He's all invisible. Why? If he falls, nobody will see it. We'll just hear it. Can we be the monks from Monty Python? Oh god, his laugh's the worst. Sounds like bubbles popping. Should I knock? Do you want me to knock, or do you just want me to knock? SAM, TALIESIN, and Which one was that, I don't know. (laughter) Okay. Can I lean back and slug the door using siege? Yeah, so that's a 15. Not my proficiency modifier. Knuckles. By the way, can I see that manhole cover you guys have been carrying around this whole time? It's got Giant runes on it. Runes of Giant. Do I recognize any of these runes? Yep. This is very important script. It says that you must carry this at all times, and if you let it go prematurely you will die. Natural 20! It's a grand total of 21. The stars are aligning. The fable goes on to say that if you hand it to one of your friends, you will shit everywhere. Immediate bowel loss. Green apple splatters all over your feet, just awful. The giant tales are to be respected. It is a fable. Is this where we let the master do the talking? Why are you talking? Persuasion check? The fables were a lie! Can I ask a question? In my bag, I have two vials of fox's cunning. Is that a potion? Can I drink one? It's so hot outside! I'm so thirsty! I would like just a sip. I had it made because I'm an idiot. Just in case the sewer plate says "eat these and enjoy" or something. I told you the fables were true! Yeah. Nice. Do I gain any temporary intelligence? Do I look over at the symbols and do they all of a sudden start to mean something? I got to A, B, C. We'll work on it. Yeah, that's the tree. Yep, that one's the wiener. Not wearing robes. Did the door to the room close? And you die. I've never been an ante before. Is it wizard's chess? Strip poker! Get the Hand Cone out! You raise after each roll? We're going to kill everybody in this motherfucking house! Uh-oh. Oh, nice, dude! She rolled an eight?!? Oh, that sucks! Yeah, I like that. Maybe you'll win one. God! Matt! You! TALIESIN and Did you roll an 11? You are a deity. It's just four hours. How big is the suit of armor, the Dawnmartyr? But smaller. Yeah, I put mine on. I like it a lot. Do we want to stay the night here? A quick query. We're, like, visitors. We don't really have a place to stay. Now that we're yours, do you have like a broom cupboard? He's going to wear us like winter coats. Going to make a suit out of our skin. But I drank that Fox's Cunning. 24. You look so mopey. Did you want a piggyback ride? All right, I pick her up and I put her on my shoulder. You looked like the creepy guy was saying we should take a break for just a second. The timing. Well, she's been gone. Sequin. Give me a third one. Waterskins from our servants-- I can create water. Don't say it like it's cool. And there might be an unbelievable amount of fire giants in that building. Oh shit. I mean, I really don't see what the problem is, right? Hellfiend goes, "Oh, time to go shopping for slaves." He walks up to the Arches, we set a trap, Vax goes stabby-stab-stab, Percy goes (gunshot), Pike goes, (high-pitched) "Hi", and like, donesky! Were you worried about being away from Fort Daxio for too long? Can't we scry on the fort? Thank you, watering boy. That's what I meant! That's what I wanted to say! But it's just him, right? One dude? He meditates. Yep. Should we go recon on the auction as slave shopping or whatever it is? Set up the door outside of the market or whatever. Unique slaves. He likes unique slaves. But it's unique, and what if inside the door we make it look even more unique? That's important to say. Yeah, and if he doesn't come in the door, then we kill him. What, do we go and make a deal with the devil? (goofy chuckle) Don't we have the neck rings, the collars, to mock that we're-- Less appealing. Less different. If you give us one order, we all understand the order! You can do it. Magic door, sextuplets. I like that! You vamp, baby, you do whatever. Do what you do. SAM; All right, and when it doesn't work, Sonny, can we fight him right there in the Arches? Will people be like, "What the fuck's going on? Arrest them all!" Right, but listen, I don't know if we have enough to bribe all the efreet. What if we went to the Charcoal Palace, spewed a tale, and said that this pit fiend is plotting to overthrow the Charcoal Palace and all we want is to remove the problem for him? So, we do it. Do we still want to try and get him in the mansion? Celestial sextuplets. I thought Percy's was long, shit. I have a quick request. Before I go to sleep, can I try and find Pike and see if she will teach me the alphabet, before my fox's cunning wears off? Yeah, look, I had trouble sleeping, and I actually know Giant, but I can't read it. Do you think maybe, before this fancy smart-potion wears off, you could teach me some letters? Well no, I don't see a lot of Giant, just even Common or-- How many-- I'm not so hot on the numbers, either. G. Oh, it is! Ah-- I. Hey! Fucking A, this is tough. Fucking? A? A. Ay. A. A. Yeah, totally. I just wanted to know something. Do I still-- no, it wore off, right? I don't have advantage. I burp, and I get a little bubble? Oh, that's even worse. Aw, minus two, fuck! Twelve. My cursive is sweet. I'm so tired. You know, I've learned all of these but I'm really sleepy. I'm not sure we will. But yeah, keep working. Good night. Thank you, Pike. And we still have the neck thing. Wait a minute. We don't want him walking through the streets, to The Arches, as a celestial. We want to get him in the house. Yeah, we haven't started walking though. So Seeming on everybody but Vax, right? Have we headed to The Arches yet? We're going to walk with a celestial in the middle of the streets? I can give him one of the Sandkheg bottles. No, it's going to die, Keyleth. Don't-- We go. What's up, me? Set up there. The celestial will sell itself. We don't need anything fancy. Shrubs? What? Maybe we wait until we see him so we don't get unwanted buyers. Yup. We're staying together. We wait to see if the pit fiend shows himself. Are they celestials? No, leave them alone. Stay on target. We're taking in everything. I see why we got them now. Even better bait. Done. Stop hitting yourself. We're waiting. Can I survey the road in the direction of the embassy. Do we see anything? Natural one. It looks like the letter ah-- And I stay there. Nobody else wants to check the road? Deceiving the devil, come on, baby! Quick, throw a price out! (laughing) Did she use the magic? Okay, I pick him up by the top of his head and I do a one, two, three! I also spit in your eye so it starts to water. Well, we're inside. Do we want to set up a sneak attack? Can we? Why? Who's inside the mansion? You can bring them out in front of the house if you want to. Then when he walks over we can-- Yeah, get him to come toward the door. I'll exit the mansion too, and start walking toward the embassy a few steps, slowly. Just to get distance. Yay, Pike!
