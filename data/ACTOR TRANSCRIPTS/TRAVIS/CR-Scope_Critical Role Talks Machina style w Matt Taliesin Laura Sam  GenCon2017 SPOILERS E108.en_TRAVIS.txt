Mine says, "Travis Willingham eats dicks." [laughter] Genken. You're twins; you share shit already. We're going to die! [laughter] Watch your wings. Fuck shopping!

A small child can not come with you. All our hands are up like a roller coaster. Man, fuck yes! [laughter, cheering] Maybe. AUDIENCE Shout-out 20 minutes! I don't say shit. No, we don't spoil it.

Why are you asking that tonight?!
