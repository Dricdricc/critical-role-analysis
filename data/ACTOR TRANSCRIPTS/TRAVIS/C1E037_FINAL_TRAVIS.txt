Or a compliment. (laughter) Reading and writing is good. It's very imp-- imp-- is good. Yeah, I've been told I'm very impotent. (laughter) You're very impotent to me. Sam's here. So we go get a letter and we go back to Emon and clear our name. Oh, we could just say somebody stole it from her. We stole it from them, we were trying to return it, it fell in acid. Well, she fixes it. Oh, here's a gift for recovering the rug. It makes perfect sense to me. Right. How did the golden snitch do? 2016, bitch. Speak for yourself. Are you looking for the notes that you don't take? Can we go get that other fucking letter please? MARISHA and Yeah. Let's go home. What, we can't go find that boy you abused in Emon and have him send the letter? That little kid you smacked around who wanted to join-- He's probably back, drawing pictures of you on the city walls and crying. If he's still alive. We'll find out as soon as we get there. I got one gold piece he's turned to kibble. Breakfast being cooked, seriously. Deep-fried French toast, baby. So thoughtful, Pike! Oh, my best friend! She's so thoughtful. Bag of Richards. We actually need him for something. You want to come see him? Yeah, we're protecting him. Let's go. We run down. Did he leave us anything? What? That's what I'm saying! Oh, we have a prisoner downstairs, though. We run down to the prison cell. Dragged back out. Any other attacks on the castle while we were gone? He's not free and clear. Dante. Dmitri. Damien. Dingleberry. Darren. Dane. Dylan? Oh, let me carry your plate for you. And I start eating his food. Brilliant. Brilliant. Hump day! Yeah? Shit. I throw him a gold coin. I thought Kibble would be dead, but he's alive. Oh, Desmond. Yeah, keep eating, Kibble. Fuck. Him and little boys, man. Impressionable. Formative years. Of age. No, I don't think so. Tell the truth. I could give him one of the expensive bottles of wine. But we really care about Vax, and this guy can look down at his hand and remember the time that he worked for some shitty vampires. We leave it be. Natural-- About what time is it? I'll go with you. I'll go with him. See, everything's fine, it's a lovely welcoming party. I stay with him. Yeah! Sorry. That could be nice. Yeah. Should we hand over the rest of our-- Hate to be him right now. Don't forget about Kibble. Might need some gut healing after those. Yeah, come on. (laughs) Wow. Fucking cold. Holy shit. Even I am taken aback. My jaw is just open like (gasps). Oh that is such a shame, I know, I almost thought about reminding you to bring your extra-- Yeah, tuck it down by your nuts, eh? Keeps it safe, makes a lady take a double look. Yeah. (satisfied laugh) "Ah sir, we're standing right here!" Are there any other guards in the room as we leave? I look at the guards at the door and I go, told ya! I wasn't worried. Who are we tracking down? They won't be on there. Did we even ask where we last saw Riskel whatever? A distraction. So you can work your magic. Yep, me as well. (confused laugh) I'm sorry. The beholder. Right, yeah, it's funny, but like the pictures that were on the big shape, right, there's something about it that reminds me with this arrangement of that time that we fought that shit-head beholder. Yeah, like, it doesn't really want us to look in it. Yeah, it's just a feral thing, you know. Is there a guard outside of the room? Should we try and shake one down, and ask who was the last person to see him? Because it's what I do. I immediately leave the room. You two. Leave. I take out Craven Edge. And I put it, unsheathed, next to my foot. You know, there are those that protect life, and they just left. Now, whatever me and my mates are gonna ask, you're going to answer honestly, or your life will be forfeit. Don't talk unless you're asked a question. My little mate over here will begin. When was the last time you saw Riskel? Insight check that bitch. I'll do it as well. 16? Spinning it. Spinning it now. On the tip. Where did he say he was gonna go? I just got it clean, I just got it clean. I mean I know the answers are inside you. If I have to open you up to get to 'em I will. I walk up and stand right next to him. I lay the sword right on the table and look at the reflection. Oh, not on the blade, not on the blade... What? What? Yeah. How are you? Can you see in this room right now? What? I was saying, can you see in this room right now. Can you see what's happening in this room right now? We are totally intimidating the shit out of-- Jeffrey? Do you see what's happening in the-- (whispering loudly) Shut the fuck up! Well, I suppose. He's been pretty helpful. (yelling) Haven't you, Jeffrey?! And I hold it right under his chin. (laughter) 14? What?! It was all part of the show. Heh. It was a show. All right, Jeffrey, you've been very helpful. Change your britches, and don't do bad stuff. And I sheath it. We should give him something. Ah, fuck him. Or is he a fucking vampire? We're definitely going. Yeah, let's go, plenty of time. Somebody's about to bust. (laughing) I take the insults! There's a street vendor on the way to the tavern that's, yep. (belches) It's like Dumb and Dumber with the gloves. Just say yes! Just say yes! Oh! We forgot about Dre. Wanna go say hi? It's gonna be great! I'm his bodyguard. He's very popular. (laughs) Oh. No, no, no. The old man wants to redistribute his wealth and we would be the vessel by which he would do that. Grog. You forgot about Dranzel. Those motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dranzel. (laughter) I think he said he asked him. No, no the old man asked him oh, I need to redistribute. Hold on. He's downstairs. Underground. Do we think maybe he's a-- I bet you one gold he's a vampire. (laughter) (gasps excitedly) Honeycomb! Oh, of thieves. Aren't you part of them? 13? To the keep, or just outside? So mayhaps with the bear entering, there is enough of a distraction for one suit of armor to clankily make its way down? 12. Yeah, she had a lot to drink! You had a lot to drink, be careful. Yeah, she's going to spew! She's got infectious diseases too! When she spews, everybody catches it! With advantage? What is fucking going on? 20. How about I pick up Pike with my 20, and I carry her in. Minimal clank. What? He forgot about that part. The things you do for women. Not really getting his meaning, I grab him by the back of the shirt and I just chuck him. Oh, oh! I have a Belt of Dwarvenkind that lets me read Dwarvish. For intelligence? (laughs) Nine. This word in Dwarvish means "gentry". No, no, don't tell him. Yeah, do that. No, I'm serious, you had a good thought! I walk forward and I grab Scanlan and everybody and I back everybody up ten feet. Make sure you disarm the other two. No, no, think of your team, make sure they're all disarmed. (laughter) (singing) Follow your heart, don't blow up your head to solve those fucking locks. Do it, man. Oh, I could do those too. Can I help her with that? And keep the money at the same time. Unnecessary. Lucky fucking druid. There are five blocks on each side. I think he knows we're full of shit. Vax and I are on either side of the door. We are in a giant death cluster. How about we spread out a touch? Like two people to a door in that hallway. I'm just saying, if he took out a magical spectacle and knows we're full of shit, we're all gonna die. I would like to rage. Just because I have a fear of construction paper. Advantage. What did it not do? 17. Nine. Of course. I rage. You want to check? I can open the door. He thinks you're going in. He's in there by himself, and no other are enemies. I bellow out you're in for the fight of your life if you don't drop your polearm. The next thing that hits the ground if you don't will be your skull. Yes. No, but I'll take Craven Edge out and leave him unsheathed, which gives me an advantage on intimidation checks. 17. What do I have left of my turn? Anything? Bonus action. Bonus action. What's a bonus action? What can I do? No, that makes me tired as shit. No, I won't do anything else. That'll hit. Halved, because I'm raging. From his what? Do I have-- Strength checks and strength saving throws, advantage. Yeah. Advantage on all strength checks and strength saving throws. Haha. 26. So 13 total halved, so seven? Misses. That'll hit. Can I squeeze by Pike, or do I need to pick her up and move her out of the way? Walk, that's cute. I would like to run past Pike and bear-form tackle him. Full shoulder in the gut, wrapping my arms around his legs, picking him up and throwing him on the ground. Guy's standing up and you're just driving into him with your whole body mass. Okay. Yes! 19. But not to the ground? Yeah, I wanted to tackle him and be on top of him. I can't attack, right? That's all I got? No. I'll stay there. Yeah, like what you see, don't you? It can't be the ground? A white or red grapevine? Blind him? We take him the fuck out of here. I'm gonna take manacles out of the Bag of Holding. Since he's holding-- his arms are pinned to his chest. And I'm gonna clasp it on both of his wrists. And then I'm gonna pick that motherfucker up on my shoulder and walk out of the room. I'd like to try. Strength or athletics? Yeah, it is. 20. Yeah, I was gonna slam him into the wall. Seven. The spirit weapon? I don't think we have a chance now. I pick him up, I put him over my shoulder and we start to walk out of the hall. Do we want to check those other rooms? LAURA and Excuse me, no interest in the other rooms, or shall we leave? We could set it on fire. We're on the fucking council. We just walk through the kitchen. It's not. We're taking him to Uriel, right? We're taking him to Uriel, we're taking him to Uriel. We're not taking him to our place, we're taking him to Uriel. To Uriel. Walk off into the sunset, credits roll, they turn right. Nope, haven't had a minute.
