Out of sync, is what they're saying. Black blades! (laughter) Binder rappel! Book rappel. Book belay. Book belay! (laughs) I'm the smartest man alive! Is it pronounced GM tips, or gmmm tips? Right, so the dragon's got booty, right? So I look over and they're working on the dragon bits. Everything's cool? Yenk is like melting into the snow, right, because he's like a hell fiend or whatever? I take off running towards the lair. Fuck. New town square will be built around it. I'm running around like a cracked-out PCP addict in the background. Just looking on the ground for booty, that's all. One. (laughter) I'm doing the dog thing. Where the fuck is it?! That's all you hear me say. (laughter) Help me look! Just dig! (laughter) No?! We're looking for that booty. No! It has to be here somewhere! What? Where? What? I see it? Can I use the siege portion of the Titanstone Knuckles and start smacking the shit out of this ice trying to get down there? Just like (smashing noises). I deal double damage against objects or structures. I really wouldn't mind. We need heat, and more than my wee urine can generate. Yeah, I mean, or get Keyleth over here. Really? But no fireballs? Why? What if I want to be close? I know. Yeah, I'm still up in the three digits. Let's make it exciting. All right, all right! Ten feet! Is there any free platinum or gold or little bits I can start to put in my hands? You saw what his face did, didn't you? Tooma, we are about to unsheathe and reveal a great fortune, of which we have very little interest because honestly it weighs us down. We're, like, plenty loaded already. However, it is a tradition to take little bits here and there as keepsakes. That sounds most generous. Shall we look for specifically interesting little bits, or just grab the platinum? Are there any interesting-looking weapons or unique items that are out of the ordinary? Yes! Minus two. 17. Yep, in fact, I lick it knowing that it's cold and I stick it to my face. Fuck! And I rip it off. I love stones. I'm a fucking fan. This is my favourite part, getting new shit. I had an idea until reddish, but I don't know anymore. They're probably like elephant strength boots. I appreciate well-made boots. LIAM and Do we have an approximation of the gold and platinum? I love this shit. It's like walking into a Toys 'R' Us. It's the fucking best. It's like, "Which way do I go?!" Wait! Let's not be hasty! My god, it's beautiful! I'm very emotional about this right now. Can I check it for traps? Natural 20! 'Tis clean. Yes. Feels like money, money, money. That's why I said we can't take that much. I'm very emotional about some of this. Forget the dragons, let's go buy real estate. Build a fucking water park, let's go! It's a lot. Scrooge McDuck over here is fucking swimming in that shit. We'll build a bank. It'll just be us. Right. We kill Vex after the first month. I was joking. True, true. So one black studded dwarven armor suit, because Pike's the only one that wears full armor. There's another full set of regular plate armor. That's going too. There's a totally decomposed orc head. A brain chunk, two dark elf heads, one random arm, a piece of bulette armor. Twelve beef jerky strips are going. By the way, this is totally up for grabs, anytime you want. You say something to me and we'll work it out. Those are super fresh. (laughter) Half of that body part stuff came out as gelatinous poo. Just strings of-- You pull it up and you got to wrap it up in the string and toss it. Scanlan. Vex. We should disable the orbs, right? Just beat the shit out of them. We don't want to taunt him first? But what if he comes here? All right. Shall we check in with the other members first, before we biggity-bounce? What about that big golden mast? You think there's a golden ship under there? It was made of gold, right? When you dry-age meat like that, salt it first, then hang it. Just a pro tip. Really bad sinus problems. Shit, yeah. Yeah, good deal. How much do you think that roll weighs? I could drag it behind me for a little bit. Can we get everything else into the Bag of Colding, besides the roll of hide? Yeah. We got so much bling. We're stupid rich. I take the mask, and like Jim Carrey in The Mask, I stick it to my face and (yells). I feel like it's making me fall in love with the first person I look-- Vax! No, you're right, I don't. I take the mask off and put it in the bag of holding. But we got this! And I hold up the big-ass platinum greatsword. It's like, covered with prunes, up and down the blade. Oh yeah, is Kima here? Stop what you're doing. I want you to get your hands on this big, beautiful bastard. And I hand her the greatsword. I could tell you, but I don't remember. I walk over and go, "Before you hit anything with it, you come talk to--" I leave. There was possibly a giant gold ship, underneath. I also took this little keepsake. I call it Stoneblack. Well don't fucking break it down like that. So anyway, I got rid of my old saltlick rock and now I've got Stoneblack here to take its place. Do you have a pet rock? Oh my god. I sleep with it, I put it under my back and it gets all the knots out. Sometimes I carry it in my armpit to keep it warm. You don't need to know about that. Well, now's a good time. I'm focusing on the war mask. So you half all damage. Yeah, sure, I won't use it. Do you have to attune to them? Does anyone want the Potion of Speed? I don't want it to be just my Christmas. That's amazing! The cube shrinks to half its size. Kima is happy? Kima is now an associate member of Vox Machina. Provisional, yeah. That's amazing. So the maul-- Kima, because I want to respect your weapon, what does the maul do? What? No, I'm just saying, what it does, or does it just beat the shit out of people beautifully by itself? Cool. You want me to hold onto it for you, or are you cool? Boss. Total boss moment. That's true. Enjoy that. Anything from the war mask? I'll unlock its secrets. Wear him down. Can I get a description of it? Can you also put my title on the inside? My title. Wait! Are you going downstairs? Can I come with you? Whoever sold you that and said it was an aerator is laughing their happy asses off. Some guy broke that off of his kid's toys and was like "It's an aerator!" Whoa. Cool. Yeah. Really nice. Was that the biggest thing it does? So five to ten. Five to eleven. Holy shit. That was amazing. I kind of want to get out there for whatever you do next. Yeah, just to see how much damage it does. Wait, can you use this in Minxie form too? No, you think so, or you don't? Do you have another one you want to do? Earth, big! That was amazing. Keyleth. Can I understand what she's saying? That sucked. That was the worst one of all of them. Yeah. No, like-- wait, is the beard all right? Yeah, okay, no. It's all good. Does it do anything else than whiff? Let me turn around. Oh man, yeah. Really, whew. Stout. Yeah. I'm questioning my faith now. Yeah, sure is. Not that I want to feel any more damage after that hurricane of pain, but does it do anything else? Give me one really big one. Like Rafiki? 20. (melodramatic groaning) Oh, the pain of-- what's this thing called? Confires! It hurts so much. I feel the reflux-- the conflux. Yeah, it's real bad. I have to leave because I feel like I might toss. Yeah, I feel like I'm going to cry too. And I leave, holding my forehead and laughing. Small, little laugh. Oh no, is it really? Of course you would know that. Love you, Matt! That's a badass motherfucking belt. Are we hearing this? Are we hearing a massive commotion? Yeah, do you hear that? I take out the bloodaxe and I follow him! Jesus! Scanlan, is this one yours? Then we fucking kill it! We race forward and attack. 23. This is a giant beast, I'm giving it what for! No, I'm not raging. (laughing) 24. 20 points, four points of necrotic. I know, I don't hit lightly. 22 points of damage. Scanlan! Roll off! Roll off, Percy! He's so weak he can barely speak! We must destroy this beast! Come on, buddy. Yeah, you go. Come on. Natural 20. I got a natural 20, so I'm good. Thank you. I'll take two strikes at the elephant's ass. That's a one. Oh. Well, that's a one, so. That's a two. So the second one was 16, the first one was a 15. Oh, nice. What a joy! The first one is 20, with four points of necrotic damage. Oh, that's right. Yeah, 20. Percy, you've been riding Raishan! Die, evil witch! I did? Sometimes I don't know if you guys would live without me. I'm really glad I'm around, sometimes. Ooh, is that my helmet?! Is there poo on it? Ooh, the mask's on the back. Did you write on the inside like I said? It looks like writing. What's it-- --is that? What language? Oh, it's Elvish? So not everybody knows what my title is. Very smart. Did you see my title? I will put on the new mask slash horned helm. Does it? Actually, because now the mask is facing the back, right? Can I fucking turn it around and put the mask on the front, with the horn sticking out the back like a big Nike swoosh? (muffled) I don't feel like this is the best-- Well, now that I got my helmet, are we going down to the ship? Like, you suck. You can find us at the Glintshore? Let's jauntily head over. Nasty woman. Yeah. Green. Giant, Common. I speak Dwarvish, but I can't read. I have a belt, yeah. Ugh! I got it. And I start going Rocky-ribcage on this big piece of meat. 21. I think we need to go. I start running out of there. Can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping? I'm not. Eight. With advantage. Look at Keyleth's arm. Okay. I start moving the ice and pull her out. That didn't go well. Maybe his woobie, you know--? Yeah, guns and ships. (hums the intro of "Alexander Hamilton") Fuck! Kima and I are sparring. Cursive, baby. It stings when you stop. With the cube out? (high-pitched) Oh shit! (singing) Go on and kiss the girl. A whole bunch of new shit. That amazing commercial. They're always so good.
