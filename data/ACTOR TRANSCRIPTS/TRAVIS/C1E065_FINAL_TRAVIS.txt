Way too late, man! Way too late! I love shooting you in the face. Yes! In the world of sportsball, the 2016 future Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys are playing the Seattle Seahawks right now! So if you see me looking down, it's not because I'm not paying attention. I'm watching football. Everybody send Sam a tweet. He's going to be crying at the outset of his team. Sam, a moment of silence. (laughing) Pan to the fireplace! Not for long. What she said. Yep, we've got it covered. It's planned out to a T. Can you put it in your necklace? I think Kashaw is a great people-person. No, we bring the dragon to the creature. You can't broker a fight between a huge beast and a white dragon? I think you've done better. Can we go somewhere in the next 60 seconds? We have 64 pounds of scales from me. We have four claws left. And we got umber hulk pieces, too. Yes! What, train them? Like when a doctor hits you and your knee jumps? Do you have a death wish? What am I missing here? I take the Gauntlets and I smash them together, and I grow in size. (laughter) Yes. I look at Vax and I go, you were just playing around, right? And in my giant state, I'm going to kick him like a soccer ball. That's good. 32. 15 on the strength check. 25. 24. The strength was 24. Seven. Can I check the Titanstone Knuckles? Have they changed now that I've kicked a friend in the face? Damn it! Eight. (chuckles) Thank you. I was getting so bored. Thanks, bubby. Good addendum. Whatever that word is. Hold on, it's going to happen. Let it happen. He's got to use the privy at some point. We got loads. Hey, I have an idea. I know, it's thrilling. We need eight gallon wine skins or bottles or jugs. Because the Alchemy Jug can make out eight gallons of fresh water. We pour it all out and then at the end of the day it starts over, so we have eight gallons sitting in the bag. Yeah, eight gallons. Yeah, we could give it away, give it away, give it away now. (coughing) Bullshit. Perpetual oasis. Source of power. (laughter) Beep-bleep. Is it for food? To market! There's no stores. One for each? Are we going? LIAM and Oh yeah, no problem. Running through! Oh shitballs. I have to move. Ten-ten, halftime. No, not good. Their starting quarterback got hurt. Because he's an old woman. That's what I was going with that! It's okay. Bees knees. Yes? I got it. Here, take this jug of water with our compliments. You said give them a jug! You want me to pour the Alchemy Jug in here? Or just one of the little ones? All right, I take the Alchemy Jug and I go You want to see a trick? Look inside. Do you see anything? And I say Now, give it a listen. And I shake it. What do you hear? Forgot they're old. Right, well, it sounds-- fuck it. Water. And I start pouring. (laughter) It creates eight gallons of fresh water. I am a great sorcerer. Gedd-e-mo-ray. Beep-beep! SAM, TALIESIN, and Shit, if we evaporate, I'll be so pissed. You don't know! Now I'm moisture. No songs to be sung. Just fucking another cloud in the fucking sky. If you can't kill the old, terrify the young. Could we turn into a marine layer? Wine? You want to put a magical door 40 feet? I'd say 200 yards out. That's what I said, but they punish crime so harshly. Yeah, we've got to learn a little bit before we kill all of them. Yeah, in. (singing) We've got to kill everybody. (laughter) What?! (laughing) I was like, "come get some, bitch!" Oh man. (laughs) Talk it out. Ew! Make him bathe. Can't we change it up? Ravioli! Shit, they do talk! They're smart. We have to kill them all! Chicken ravioli. (laughs) Good call. Sucks. How about you let me take the lead on this? Keyleth, do you really want to be honest or is it a ploy? Do we want to be honest? (laughs) Yeah, thank you. Travis needs to make an intelligence check. Oh Jesus, it's a 12. Minus two. I'm all in. Violence. That's what I came away with. (garbled) This ravioli is delicious, by the way. My compliments to the little purple men. But they give a shit about the goliath? That's fucked up. The Hand? Got to get laid. There's nothing that doesn't mean it's a pact. Wait, what if there's a market, like an open farmer's market we could get some spice? Their hands aren't moving into someone's pockets? Yes! Oh my god! Yo, you cool? You cool, dog? Fuck. That was great. Do we go in the direction? Can I whip around and see if anyone's following us? Hammer down! 14. I am a gorgeous man. In love? Enamored? Jealous? Are any of the barkers talking about magic stuff? Well, I don't know. It just seems so exotic. Negative two. (laughter) Yep. I quickly get on my hands and knees, and I start moving the sand around, looking for one just like it, just to make sure it's unique. Oh! What does it taste like? I gave away my salt-lick rock! I found a rock! I stopped looking. It's pre-season. Nobody playing right now. I would love to. Yeah? My what? All right. Be cool, man. Be cool. Something stronger. Getting our own? As we're in there, do we notice anyone with any large scars walking around? This'll go great. 12. There are no really large, scarred people in here. I have no ruby. Nope. There was no ruby. Look, Little Teeny is my friend. All right? He spoke to me out of the deserts of fate, and he is mine and mine alone. (loudly) Are you buying drugs? (laughter) Can we all come? It sounds super dangerous. I just want to watch. I'll be so sly. What happened to you? Is there a bar in this place? A proper bar? Right. Can I flag down a-- Yeah, I'm royalty from a far-off land. I pride myself on trying the fiercest spirit in the area that I'm visiting. What do you guys pride yourself on? The sandcake side? Oh, hide. Oh, is it a food or a drink? Yeah, then one of those'd be great. Yeah, well, don't tell anybody but I'm super fucking rich. Only because I have to check with my national treasury, how much is it? A bottle. I'll take two. We be clubbing, motherfuckers. Okay, maybe there's champagne though, yes? This was meant for me. Oh! May I start a tab? No? Fine. Then I give, shit. (mutters) How much do I owe? No problems. Prepare to drink like kings. Yeah, it's like amazing animal-skin Maker's Mark. So how do we crack this bitch open? Right. Are there any opening utensils around, because I don't want to unsheathe-- Who wants to be first? Keyleth? You want a shot? Does it taste good? TALIESIN and (high-pitched) It hurts man, oh my god! I'm going to stopper it and then I'm going to put the extra bottle in the Bag of Holding. Nope. (laughing) Money well spent! It's a living thing. How long until you have to meet this guy at the casino? Well, we've got time to kill, right? So we take off for the Debt's Respite. No, you're not. I will. I go with her. I look around. Could I ask, (coughs) other than gambling, what sort of entertainment can you find in this city? I'm sorry, could you just, a bit more on-- What? Duel? A duel? A one-on-one duel? In this city, it's legal? Anytime? High noon, midnight, when? Wait, is that that super fucking tall thing we saw? All right. SAM and You're planning to recruit this person? Just curious, have you ever had the Sandkheg Hide? Yeah. I'm just asking. Really? Too stiff for you? I mean, I hear only real bosses can drink that jazz. What do you mean, some beast? Who'd make a drink out of some animal's whatever? Yeah! (sputters) Hold on. You mean they squeeze the asshole of something out there? No! Yeah, it's 300 something gold! No. Three. It's a giant, hairy water yak. We were gifted a bottle, and a couple of my friends had partook. They say the stuff we had is A-plus. Yeah, sure. Are we going two to a room? Yeah. Cool. Where is it? A Kingly Rest. All right. What? We have three fancy robes left. Can we go back out to the bazaar? Are far from there, or are we still close? They sell any weapons? Can I look and see if people are selling weapons? Are there any exotic weapons? Okay. (laughing) That eyebrow. Stonewalled! Hey, guys. I had a thought. You know we were all supposed to have a meeting with the king? And I haven't been paying attention if anyone's watching, and we got time to kill. Should we go have a talk with the big man? Yeah. Who knows if they'll even get to us today? She's the what? Windows in this room? Was that the only door to the room? I walk up to the guard, and I say, sorry. I really should have peed before I came in. Is there a privy I could use? It looks that way, but I also have a strapping-sized bladder, and I've been known to leave strapping-sized messes in corners. You see, I don't really come from all this finery, so the side of the wall is just as good with me. It's just I'm trying to be polite. That'll do. Thank you for the bucket. I'll hold it. I really want to touch the walls. It's the pharaoh king from Stargate. And thank you, Loot Crate.
