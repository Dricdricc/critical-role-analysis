Shadow of War! Oh shit! The sequel to Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor. I remember talking to you! I was Commanding Orc 1. But with the sex appeal of Grog. It's such a dope game. The Nemesis system has been improved on from last time. We can testify. And make us rise to the higher echelons of the orc order. They'll let you delineate between Harvey and Irma, too, in case you want to pick one over the other. Harvey had a lot of support from J.J. Watt's $30+ million dollars. Irma, the damage is still accruing. Nah, but we make happy stuff. Ooh! Critical Role back brace! Do you DM 20 hours a week? We've got something for you! DM is very excited. Yeah! End of this month, we're going to be at Anime Weekend Atlanta. The last week of September. Hotlanta, Georgia. We're going to be there with other people like Jennifer Hale and people like that. But we're going to be there. Come out, say hi, smack our hands, not our faces. It's pretty dope. I want to get in that aquarium with those whale sharks. That's what I want to do. We're not going to have time for that. And then, also, in the middle of November, we're going to be going to Australia. Laura and I are going for two weeks. We're going to be in Adelaide, Brisbane. So for all the Aussies-- what? Oh shit! So barring Laura's passport showing up-- (sighs) Adelaide, Brisbane. If you're there, you want to see us, come see maybe just me. (laughter) Will Friedle will be there, too. He's going to be my convention wife. Me and Friedle. Oh, I totally have that covered. Wait, Vax. You should consult that little scrawny NPC fellow that was supposed-- oh, wait. Oh, he's dead. Nope. No, I picked up that hammer that was hitting me in the face. We all have at least the one superior from the brass dragon. I didn't roll any hit dice. Should we roll some hit dice? I clearly do not remember this. That's right, I remember. I don't remember what I read, but I remember. Yep. There were things. We also need to be on the lookout for that sword, remember? In the story? Just saying. Keep your eyes peeled, high-perception people. And Vex is probably with her brother. I'll be right behind the twins. It's the twins and then me. Who wants to be behind? How's it look? Pick from your fucking 300 dice. Almost poked my eye out. You almost made me Vecna. Like Shawshank Redemption and the poop pipe. Well, that's what's most important. Are the Knuckles still doing that vibrating hum thing? Can I go into a rage? And I would like to try and bash the shit out of this-- TALIESIN and I'm going to do the one-inch punch. Yeah, because I'm an angry monster. 21. What? (angry panting) (punch impact) Can I make it reckless-- oh, I didn't say it. Oh, yeah, siege. Oh, it's fine. 30. Okay, 1d4. Four! Eight. 27. No. And my rage damage is 15. Well, that's with the axe. Do I hit it now? SAM, TALIESIN, and Oh, that's even better. 33. Two plus eight. Ten plus-- 14. I'm so swole right now. Hey guys, it's a Z. Let me find out. So I wiggle up a little more. It's a well-constructed hallway of dwarvish make. (groans) Yeah. His heart beats once a century, so let him go. Push them! Incinerator or lasers. That was a great jump for me and my character. Light the brazier! Yeah, but it's Vax. Is it for real? You are lying! Are we still in the room? No problem. I'll get it down. Is there anything going on in the tunnel, on the outside of this door, where we are? Temperature check, anything like that? Natural 20. There's no ash on the floor in the hallway that we are in right now, right? I don't want that door to fucking open all of a sudden. Are there still charred wooden pieces in the middle of it? It's not the source of the flame. Not for that much heat. Look for Dwarvish. I'm aces with that. But they're revealed by heat. When you're a big fire, the walking thing-- Sure. Do you take damage from fire? So you should be in here. We also have an unseen servant. It might be a depression on the wall or something. The regular buttons or the magic ones? No depression, no toggle? I've got this, you guys. Oh! Minus two. 17! Fifth Element, anyone? Oh look! Breath of Grog reveals all! Look, behold! Two. Lines. I breathed on the wall. If you're looking at the door we came in, Grog blew on the lower right? Two vertical lines. What about above the door? It is opposite of the mirror, right? If one's a door, and the other one's a door? Constitution check to see who passes out first? Can I clear off the door area that we walked through? I only know Dwarven writing. I don't know runes. The runes are part of the Dwarven language, so I know them. Help me, Pike! Yeah, I would like to decipher what these symbols mean. I hold her up to the upper left corner of the doorway. Three. All right. Now, to the upper right-hand corner. Okay. I put her on the ground and I say, okay, look at the lower right-hand corner. And now the lower left-hand corner. I have the same thing as Laura. Yes. Should we check around the mirror frame to see if there's anything to dust off? The mirror frame? Can I wipe off the edges around the frame and see if there's anything around the frame of the mirror, since I seem to be so good at this? Three. It's clear. We found everything there is to find. Well, there's no saying that it will activate if we do it correctly. I have a lance. It's almost broken. You have a slightly splintered lance. Yeah, let's go. Hurry! We don't know how long it will stay open for. We beat a door. Iron stairs? Stone stairs? These are dwarven steps that are relatively shallow. 25, you said? Can I look for a doorknob or a keyhole? Is there shattered remnants of the door? Any doorknob or a keyhole that's on the ground or anything? Two. Roll! Roll again. I'd like to see the temple, if I can. Well look, all right, my gloves-- (whispering) My gloves come from the heart of a ruined primordial titan. So if maybe they harvested pieces of my gloves, and it's in a temple, I don't know, you smart people could do something with that. Yes. Yep. They're just buzzing. Are they humming more? Nope, just humming. Two steps closer to the temple. Are they appearing buzzing more? Ooh! 19. We are also looking for the Sword of Kas. What's if it's in the temple? Why did he choose this? 200 miles away once we entered is how far away we are from Vasselheim. 200 miles. With steps of? We have time to check the temple. No, don't do it. I'm cool. I'll vote for a temple party. I need the carpet. Sam saved our asses. Natural one. On the chain. Literally on the text chain. A big statue just fell. All right, we move accordingly. We could just go straight up. 26. Natural 20. With Gil's dice. Nice. Am I hitting them? Yeah, Okay. Reckless, great weapon master. 31 for the first one. Okay, cool. Can I use the other strike on another? Reckless great weapon. That'll hit. That's like 30. 32. We might want to save that Turnt Undead. 28 Days Later, they run. Okay, how about I don't move and somebody with flying ability go to check out that blue glowy window? When we were at the opening, we were 50 to 60 feet away. So should we fly up to that window? Let's do it. 26. Is there a story? He is invisible, isn't he? If he destroys Vasselheim, he does his miracle, his display of power, and he will be even stronger. That is not an option. I don't think a long rest is in the cards. And he may be too strong at that point. How about we get ready to leave? I'll get on the carpet. Who's on the broom with Vex? No, who is on the broom with you? Do you want to get on the carpet with me? And he can fly. Well, kick Trinket out of the necklace, and I'll get in there. All right, so how do we fly? How do we do that? Yeah, sometimes you just got to leap, okay? Who burns a spell to become an animal? You do that. Probably. What if only half the room leaves, though? They don't give a shit. Do it. I'm on the carpet. We're ready to go. Percy and Vex are on the broom. Yeah, I have to be. Yep. I can absolutely do that. I have a hooded lantern that has fuel in it. It will even burn when it lands. It's been sitting in there for four years. If they chase the jewel, fuck the jewel, and we'll leave. Put the bones down gently. Not the lantern? I take the hooded lantern and I (laughs) I throw the fucking piss out of it. Oh, that's good! 19. If the entrance is here, I'm throwing it in the opposite direction of where we are. Are they far away from the other ones that aren't leaving yet? Bag of Holding. It doesn't hurt my hand, or anything, does it? Cool! We've got that. Yes, we fly up. 18. Debbie Downer. Remember, we have the-- Yeah! [break] Do you want me to pull it out? No undead, right? No creatures, nobody that's going to (whoop) to the shiny blue light? That's slow. Is it a cut jewel, or is it rough? We don't have Identify or anything like that, do we? MARISHA and I think we should try and smash it. What else are we going to do to it before we face El Vecna? SÃ­. Or we spike it down the hole, and it causes a hydrogen bomb, and we shatter this titan in half. It's blue, right? That is the color of hydrogen. It is known. It's palm-sized, right? No, these are stone-gray. This is blue crystal. It could be a soul or something. Does Pike have anything that detects a soul? Well, then I don't know what else to do. I think we keep moving. We'll think about smashing it when we take our rest. Maybe a cause will reveal itself. Is there any writing or engraving or runes on the edge of the circle that's been engineered? Also fair to assume that whatever's on the other side of that door-- Whoa. Use your legs. Really, use your legs. Is there any decorating or writing or scratching around the door frame or wall around the door? Anything other than a portal to go through? How far apart are the doors? Do we want to have Keyleth there in case 900 undead zombies start pouring through, and she can Wall of Stone the door? I will try and remove one of the doors. I don't know how to delineate between them. Sure. Yeah. It's a circle. That one. 25. I didn't get that sense at all. Shall I? Are the hinges on this side so it looks like it opens towards me? I'll pull open the door. Should I punch the rubble? I make my way around. 20 on the dot. A rockslide continues onward. Slick, dry. Dope. That's awesome. I'm getting creepy as fuck now. I've got the Immovable Rod; I'll be the caboose. I'll go ahead and take the Immovable Rod out and have it in my hand. They're dry-rotted. They'll break easy. After you're done with them, I'll actually take them. Okay. I got them. I've got one. I've got two, actually. I've got two vials of underwater breathing. Any other boxes to smash? And undead. Immovable Rod's out. You already did 40 point of damage without doubling. How much damage? Total. Don't fuck me, Gil. No. 21. That's weird for you. We're not up at the top, are we? As I hear the sweet melodical Miami Vice tunes of warfare being played, can I double dash up past my mates and into the fray? Yeah, straight towards them. Then can I use dash to go the rest of the way? Now, I only have my bonus action left, so can I go into a rage? That's my turn. What does Wall of Force do? Can I walk through that shit? Will it? Which was that way, right? (counting) 60 is how far away he is. It's a Sphere of Annihilation. I do. I have Danger Sense. It fucks you up. Yeah, it hurts real bad. 16. Take my life, but not my beard. Does the Sphere of Annihilation get an attack of opportunity if I run away? It's real bad. They can, but at least they'll be here. Who can get to the other side? You have Dimension Door. But that's it, right? That's the only person that has that kind of a thing. The Wall of Force? No! And you need to focus, or is it a random? Hey, man. That was a nice try. No. What? Ghosts or wraiths? My fucking god! And Scanlan's in five feet of her? It explodes near my head, and I'm like Stop shooting into this thing! That's my fault. I'm going to try and run through the Wall of Force. It's only five feet of my movement, and we'll see what happens. Probably some eyelids? Do I go anywhere? Not even an inch? What if I channel all the rage from my life, and I draw on the undead? Okay, cool. I'm going to turn around and run the other way. No, it didn't even give, apparently. (counting) 50, right there. Yeah, that ends my turn. We can't do anything. Nobody knows Disintegrate or anything? Or yourself. Really? Okay. Thank you. And the previous ruling was it worked. Oh god. Come on, maybe it needed to be something else. I am wickedly out of my element. I'm running from an 8-ball. Yeah, I am, aren't I? Okay. Cool. I'm going to put my faith in Scanlan that some sort of impossible miracle happens. (counting) 30. Right up against the wall. Can I look to the left down that hallway? Can I see down there at all? Is it blocking the hallway off from vision? Is that a moveable space? It hadn't finished doing it? Not enough to make a concentration check? I'm there. I can't get into that hole anymore, can I? Fair enough. I will hold my action until someone comes within melee distance. He's upset that he miscalculated. The DM wants blood! Tiny little nubs? Damn it, Matt. Why'd you have to back up? Yeah, do it. Take your time, baby. Take your time. Taliesin, give him a backrub. Come on, let's focus up here. There you go. Support. Feel the love. Do your thing. Listen, Shadow of War comes out October 10th. A lot of us are in it. Come on. Vax. Why don't you go down the hallway and see if anyone else is coming? Keep watch. Two-Face! Some other voice starts coming out of him. It might be high, dude. You might have to roll a 30. Indiana? Let it go. Yeah, but it only makes a hole its size. It's two feet across. Plus, remember the guy was concentrating super hard, so it's the only thing Scanlan will probably be able to do. Do we know how far the sphere can move in a single movement? The sphere can only move 15 feet. No, they have to tell the truth when you do Speak with Dead. I think I know that. Oh shit.
