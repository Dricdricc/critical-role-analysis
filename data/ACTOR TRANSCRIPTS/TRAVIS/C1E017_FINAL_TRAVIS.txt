Put your head right here. And my Grog raging one with blood covering his face. (growls) Don't do it. No more. And Scanlan's still in the pooper. He's not really. Where are you going? Yes! I go over and provide very vigorous CPR. No mouth to mouth, just that hand part. (laughing) "Like a trailing fart." "Asp Hole?" What does it say? "Where you" what? And we'll find it. I'd be all right with that. (laughing) No you do not! (laughing) You're in a temple, man! Do we need to collect the dump? He's covering his face. I think we need the blue shit. But what's the purpose of the potion? To make your poo blue? Wasn't there a guy with a red beard we were supposed to go see? Oh, I got this. Natural four. Kord? Did you look at it? Did you use your fancy eyes to look at it? Worship? Yes. What else can you tell us about this Crucible? Have you been to this Crucible often, and if so, is there a champion or a favorite that you've seen or know of? We're going to be rich! How far is the Crucible from here? Kord's strength. Core strength to you. Namaste. Like a kid getting too close to an amusement park, I take off running. Okay! Oh, they don't like magic. Can I grab the nearest person near me, turn whoever's shoulder that is, and go, who is she? Yeah, very new. The Siren? Be a pity not to have one more. Wish? It's more like an itch. A need. Oh yeah, watch out. Caliber? This is my friend, Scanlan. I haven't laughed so hard in my entire life. Face beaten, he says. Face beaten! It's my middle-- I only have one name. (laughter) Yeah. We don't know yet. Okay. I've got this scar here. How does he think I got it? A hundred of my own gold on me. In my mouth? Him? Should I have a fancy name? Phillip. (laughter) I envy your facial hair. I'm going to kill him. That's a rule, right? I'm not supposed to kill him? What happens if they start to cry? I like it. Kern the Shithead does? Can I have my cask of ale, real fast? What do I want to do to prepare? I took a drink from the cask of ale-- That's a really good question. I would like to rage. And I jump in the fucking pit. 20. I would like to cast Intimidating Presence on Fern the Fucknut. He never gets it right. Phillip, thank you. Saving throw, 13. I'll let him come to me. Misses. That hits. That definitely hits. I would like to go into a frenzied rage. I would like to start with a giant front-kick forward and then hammer him down. Shit, that misses. Two. Yep. That's a 19. And also 19. That is a 16. Six. It was four, and then half of that is two, plus my modifier, which is four, so six. And then four. This is what I use? For my fists? I got big-ass fists! I got tattoos and shit on them. I never shower, they fucking stink! No, my modifier's plus four. Two. Minus two. Oh, five, yeah. 20. No one fucks with Phillip Jr. I would like to bull rush and try and tackle him, and if it succeeds, I'd like to headbutt him on the ground. And I would only get two attacks, right? Okay. All right. No, that's even better. 22. Say hi! (boosh) That's a lot. 24. 1d4? It's my head! It's got tattoos on it. One and a half. Oh. One and a half plus my strength, right? I like it. I would like to keep his head right where I have it and take my elbow and drive it down into the bridge of his nose. So that's 25? 22? And 17. With this thing again? Six. It's hard to get above a six. And six. 12. I like the feint, I like the feint. You hit me with the knuckle you fucking licked. So I'd like to jump forward and throw my knee forward and at the last minute pull it back and throw my fist in a Superman punch. Yes, fuck you, 19. And I'll follow it over with a left-right. (boom, boom) 21. Oh yeah, frenzied, so I get three. And 22. Outstanding. Watch me roll a six. 16, total. What else do I have? What can I do? I roll up off of my side and I start to go, oh, I don't know, it might be too much. And I grab a handful of dirt and I throw it up into his face. Fuck. Thank you, god. 26. Because I feel like we have a kinship, I take my foot and I throw it right up into his grundle, just soccer-kick the shit out of his nuts. (laughter) That's even better! 25. Oh no, I only have two, right? Ten. Halved. Six. 11. Well, did he drop to his knees? Oh, really? Yeah, same place. Literally trying to see him cough a testicle. (laughter) He rolled a 20? Oh, amazing. Since we're clutched in that grip, I'll grab him back and I'm going to try and bite his nose off. Oh, he's missing a hollow, right? How about I just aim for this area and if I catch lip I'll take it as a victory. Yes! Okay, 21. 20. And 24. The first one is six. Would you say that he reaches back for his face like that in pain? Fantastic. I'd like to just drive my fist into his throat as his head's arched back. Yes! Five. Would you say that he bends forward, then, because he's grabbing his throat like that? Right, I would say I go up next to him and invoke a fabled hero that I heard about in the woods named Macho Man Randy Savage, and I double-tap my elbow and drive it down on top of his head. Thank you. Six. Ten. What? Oh, good. (laughs) I was thinking 22 points of damage! I say, tastes like home. And I spit in his face and reach up and thunderclap both of his ears. 24. 17. 22. Oh yeah, right. Six. He pulled away from my wrists, and I'll give him a little of the same. Put my fists together and just swing straight down into his solar plexus since he's sitting on top of me. That's a five. I can't hear you. What? Misses! Misses! You son of a bitch! Okay. (growls) I would like to reach forward with both of my thumbs and shove them into his fucking eye sockets. Fuck! 12. That's better. 22. He's still on top of me, isn't he? 18. Would you say he's on my chest? I was going to grapple him, but if he's on my chest, I'll use my thighs to shove him up towards the upper part of my body and I'll drive down my elbow at the same time. Into that whole bloody target area. I got at least a six. We look like a Rocky movie right now. I must break you! Misses. Hits. Misses! I'm going to rush at him, spit on my knuckles, swing back, and at the last second, take my right foot and drive it right through his kneecap. Fuck you! Yes! 24. 22. 19? Five. Six. Six. I want to drive my foot through his kneecap. Oh, that's amazing. I'll just put my foot through his other knee. I would like to grab his head, since he's probably kneeling on the ground at this point, right? And say, there's only room for one to rage in this pit. And I take it, and I just smash into the top of his jaw, hopefully dislocating the bloody, lipless face that I see. Wait, is he an orc? As a half-orc, does he got those big teeth? I'll grab onto those. He's like the Black Knight in Monty Python! He's got no knees! I say nothing. I walk away. I like your beard. It looked like rain, right? I'll be out there with the pigs. Where do I mark off my loss of pride? What did he have, that orc piece of shit, he had what that made him come back? He had one left?! That's even worse! What's that mean? Oh, you weren't serious, were you? I thought you were being funny. (laughter) Thank you. And if there had been weapons I'd be in deep shit. I'll be at the bar. The frying on this chicken is exquisite. Fuck! Right, listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale! I never puke. What, food? I think I'm good. Now that sounds like a plan. Water? It's pretty smooth. (laughter) I think we have to go back on the airship to go get it. The Braving Grounds, we could see if they need any-- since we-- I lost us a lot of (tearing up) money. Some more? Okay. We can see if they need anyone for hire, go and have a... (tearing up again) being strong. Plus we have the poo cell phone. Keyleth, do you have an opinion? To hit. To kiss. Yeah, I'm a goliath. What about it? I have a question for you, Vax. The Braving Grounds that are here, would it be to our benefit to collect maybe some coin and practice our (gets choked up) fighting before we go to the maybe-friendly fire jugglers' village? Not the Crucible. Don't rub my face in it. Not in the Crucible, to the Braving Grounds. Was that the Crucible I was in? (choked up) I could've. Totally could've. I saved it for too late. I did it too late. But then in the balls... And we can use weapons if they suck, right? Yes! Can we go find an armory or somewhere that sells pointy things? I tuck that inside of my belt-beard. Just so it's nice there. One little part of it just flapping out. Oh, it is a new day. Nine, 90. It goes the other way?! My life is shit! I can't do anything! I'm hanging myself. Where's the bridge? You really are? Have you seen them, ever? Yeah. Go ask one of the Bastion guys what it was. They remember. LAURA and I grab my earring and I say, Tiberius, where are you? Where? I run back to the tavern real fast. People have left, right? Barkeep still there? It's okay, it left. Big crack in the wall. Might think about leaving. Before you do, the Siren. Where might I find her? I can only come if Tiberius lets me. I grab Trinket's paw like in Superman 1, and we fly. Thank you, Tiberius. Let's use some bait. Maybe the Slayer's Take. 12. 15. Set a really good trap. Let's think about this. We could lightning the water. Suggestions? Or lightning the water? Keyleth, you're up. I'm going to post up on, where's my laser pointer? Me? Can I run all the way up and try and pull a Vax, like he did? Hey, I want to try that! And I rage as I attack it! I swing away. 24. Yes, and the second. 16. That's it, just the two. I'm not frenzied. Yes. 17. 13. Hits. Yeah, I guess so. Phillip's a fucking douche today. Yeah, Trinket! What did you roll? Say it! Four-eight? We're apparently taking someone's bounty. I would like to look to the woman that swung and missed and go, oh, I think you meant to do this. And I'll swing for the body of the hydra. 24. And 20. Why didn't I use the stupid dice, but that's okay. 19? And 11. What am I rolling, sorry? Oh, I rolled a 14, plus anything? Yeah, I do! Proficiency or what? Oh. Two. So 16, plus-- 18 for the first one. Nine. Nine. Yeah, I got it. I'm all good. Who can heal really a lot really fast? He's going to be fine. I've rushed to Trinket's side, too, from where I'm at. I rolled two hit dice-- I'd put your hand down. You see, I had a horrible day yesterday, and unless you want to end up like puppy-dog here, we'll all end up in a big pile of blood, unless you find a way to split your take with us, and maybe let us go on our way. You see, we're new in these parts, and we have a habit for killing. Who is this leader of yours? What if we return, saying that you had acquired our services in the killing of this beast? I'm sorry, a little clarification. We get paid to kill? Are you in the company or know of Siren? Yeah, I'm definitely in. Respect. We have a name. Vox Machina. I am. I kept a keepsake. Don't. I grab him and I start walking out of the room. When do we get our brand? Can we stay in the guildhall while we're waiting?
