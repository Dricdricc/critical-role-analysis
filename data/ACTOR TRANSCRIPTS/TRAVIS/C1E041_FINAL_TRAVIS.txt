February 19th to the 21st. Come say hi! Yeah. If you're even in a neighboring state, come see us, because we might not make it all that way again. (yelling) I got him! Prepare yourself! That smells extra like dog farts! Just have a piece! One little piece! I'll give you the ear. Dork dollars, that's like bitcoin, right? You didn't save her? I would hope so. Would you straight-up run, or would you throw people in front of you so that they would be trampled? Bacon jerky's fucking good! You want some? You want to join the fold? Negotiation? Bullshit. Nothing like genocide to put you in the mood! We are scattered. Security tunnels! Wait, who was with Gilmore? His forces are divided. Me too. 400 years ago? Yeah, slightly. Within Emon. Say what? (quietly) Well, fuck. Heh. Doody. Hey, big dragon, there's a snack over here. Take a bite! Do dragons have families? Do they have, like, wives and loved ones? We should ask him. What about a spy? Dragons want servitude, right? So, what if we send a shady piece of shit to go bend the knee and walk on the inside? It's true! (gasps) Ancient, giant, red, fuck-off dragon! You'll be his bitch! You'll trim his toenails, you'll get real buddy-buddy-- Yeah, I mean like what, dragons have to eat right? Dragons eat? Yeah! So you poison a cow, and then you're like, Oh Lord Thioredoxin, here you go! Poison cow, you're dead, hero of the city! (stuttering) You Dimension Door! You're super quick! It's a no brainer! You know the best way to flush out something like that? If someone was a spy. (laughter) Will surely die. Which I'm all right with. Hot fudge? Do better. Are there any injuries in the room that we haven't attended to? Good job, Pike. And you too, Vex. Don't forget to visit Gilmore's Glorious Goods. Who's Travis? I can't just hop in and out of character. My sword. What? Hindsight is ten-- He got to moving. Yeah. If Uriel's farther away, it's-- Yeah, it's a moo point. I agree. Let's go find that magic fucker. Oh, shit. I can stay guard with the rest of everybody else, because I'm okay. You fucking-- that was my question. You expect me to remember those sort of things? Yeah, your ass. Yeah, we're going to check out that tunnel first. And then-- sorry, I was going to say and then when we get to the the city, then we figure out what we do. Leave it to me. Is his hair blowing in the wind as he rejects that amount? Yeah, you might die. He might die. Is there a light vision? I'm on it. Is there anything past that? You sneaky dick. Roll high, you pointy-eared bastard. Oh my god, make him something! Ashley? 23. Yeah, leave it. Let's go before we're discovered, quickly. Are we out in the open right now? Can we fucking get inside, please? You want to walk towards the temple? Can I slink back to Vax? And I say you still think that what was inside that skull is worse than all of this? Yeah, but we could have done something about it. I walk on. Yeah, big sword comes out, too. It'll be your last time back if you're not careful. Vex, please let me off the chain. I was walking with Vax. 14. Two 12s and two 14s. That's some Hateful Eight shit right there. Just signed your death certificate. Hits. Yep. Nope. Yep. Like conductor-style. After taking a few hits from the sacrificial lamb that stands between Vax and I, I unsheathe Craven Edge, feeling the goosebumps rush up my skin, and I look down at him and say, please run. And I draw the blade across my hand and I go into a frenzied rage. (laughter) We're bonded. It's a match made in heaven. I would also like to use reckless attack as I take my three attacks at this piece of shit. Two attacks this turn. That is a 19. Yes. And that is-- not great, that's 11. That's a 22 for the first one. 19 on the second one. And they both have to make the DC saving throw. Yeah, same guy. Plus one to damage? Can I look over my shoulder to the guy on the left and like, you're next! I'll stay there. Fuck somebody up. That hits. Misses. Misses. Skewer that piece of shit. Let the dice hit the floor. The poor bastard that's closest to you to my upper right, yeah, that little fuck's going to get Great Weapon Master relentless attacks. All three. That is better. 14? Yeah. I'll take that one. I had one additional damage dice. Oh, jesus. On crits or kills, it's an extra hit. Me and the sword are vibing, man. Okay, yeah. 18, 28. Just the strength, right? That's a lot of math. Roll another dice. That's a six-- 29, 40, 44? That goes up two. Yes! I critted on the third one. 22, 32. 21? 24 points. Oh no, 34 points of damage because it's Great Weapon Master. Oh, plus two, 36 points. I've never been more happy in my life. Oh, don't worry. Is he the only one left? Where's the meat? What? Oh! Run over. I help. They gave it to him. Did we ask? Knock him out, or--? You know how you solve that? Jar full of farts! Oh shit. We got better than that, we got a potion. And honestly, if we're going to be moving about on the streets, I'd like you to not fall open like a can of baked beans, if you don't mind. All by yourself? Yeah, I understand that. Where do you want to go? They were keeping it. They were hiding it away in one place. I'll go with the family. Yeah, it's all the time, really. Vax? He's a fan of it. Twins out in front. We're going to the Clasp entrance, right, to go to the tunnels and all the network of shit that we don't understand because they'll be allies and the people that are going to stealth ahead are going to go to the well? I'm going, yeah, with the kids. Don't tell us, just do it! 27. Natural 20. Oh, I thought he said everybody. I escort the kids expertly. I'm a champ at babysitting. You're with me, Pike. Way to tell them, Kiki. Oh, shit. (laughter) I think the fields would be my vote. Oh. Out of the city is I think the safest way. (sighs) Fine. Secret passage it is. Yeah, or mine. In character or as Jason?
