Do you know how many people are going to go to their website and enter in "Taryon". They're like "What the fuck!?" "Code not received." Wisconsin! What a tease. What a tease. Nope. They don't want me. Superman. Crossovers? Yeah! Buuhh, Vikings! (loud belch) The male raider. It comes out Tuesday, February 14th on all gaming platforms. It's Valentine's Day-- I didn't... miss... (all laugh) And farting a lot. That's true. You did both of those? That's a bunch of stank. MATT and Yeah. Here it comes. You have the joy of children in your life! The beacons of hope in life. Of future generations. (all laugh) He's so thirsty! He's just dehydrated. That's a good way to go. Aw, yeah! Come on out! (all applaud) Woo-woo! Is that really his name? Oi, T-- Tar-- Tary Jumbo. Jumbo-- Tar-- I'm Tary. Can you spell out your name for me on a piece of parchment? Frequently. No, no. I asked you to spell it out on a piece of parchment. Yeah, I'm, uh, I study handwriting. Whoa. I know. Mm! Yes. Uh-huh. Thank you. Oh my god, behind you! It was nothing. I'm always looking out for this group, though. Thank you. No, I'm-- Yeah, just the biggest. Nope. We just got here and then you started talking. We've been here before? Oh. Oh god, don't point to me, I forgot we were even here. Tary Jumbo. What? I don't even remember being here! Oh! I still don't have it, I'm trying to-- Tary, we work on very strict rules. If you fuck us, we take your hands. We really don't know what's in there. Yeah. Thought you had to-- oh, yeah! And it extends, but-- Â Did we not get anything for that? Oh. Could we see the debt or was it magic? Whoa. Glad we did that. (all laugh) Yes! Yes! Yes! Tary, do you drink anything? Does Dottie drink anything? Right. Then that's two for you. I'll have two of your strongest whatevers for blond-chin over there. Holy fuck. Hey Tary! Open up! Missile snaring! Huggies. Yes, keep going. Oh God. The universe is collapsing. Tary Jumbo, do you have a most dangerous conquest in that book? That Dotty has. Just any maiden? Shopping is not what it's cracked up to be. You should just wipe it off the list right now. While we're watching. You can just erase it. You'll be fine. Several times. Hard to count. Dragons. Please. Hold on. Wait, one more! Maybe some meats too, if you have any. Or cheeses. Oh. It's a newbie, it's a newbie. Which is why it screwed you. What? No! Oh my god. That's where the good stuff happens. Tavern corner. (gasps) Yeah, insight check that money. Fucking roll high. That's not the cup of a carpenter. Hey, Percy. We're not near them, right? Hey, hey. Remember when we were at Greyskull Keep, and we made all the guards, like, audition to be guards? What if we have an audition for Tary Jumbo? I love it when I do that, right? We have business here? You know, I can stand outside with him. How about I audition him outside, while you go have your convo? Like, we make him beat somebody up or something. I'm saying we should, like, initiate Ole Tary J. If that's what the letter that second word starts with. Yup. What? Plus, these are several, subtle steps. We don't just chuck you in the furnace right away. We've got to temper you a bit. Cool. Set up a craft fair. I will kill myself. Yeah! Cinnamon Tower! (all laugh) How tall is it again? So just a bit taller than me? A head and a half? Was he kind of like, Fassbender size-ish, or? Okay. Got it. It's Groot. That's her name. Roll your new dice to redeem it for that shit-- Should have done it. You're deaf? So bored right now. Cinnamon Tower. Oh, fucking shit. Beep-beep! He must be sick. Yeah. Well, I think it's about time that we see what Tary Jumbo's worth. One of your things on your list, right, it was to get in a kerfuffle? Riff-ram, bah-zhu. We gotta know how-- No, no, literally hell. There's like seven or eleven of them. Are those together? Close? Yeah, I think so. Do I see any large, intimidating looking creatures just walking around where we are at the moment? I'm not talking to you. 12. You see that fruit merchant over there? Killed many, many people. I might just hit him. I might just attack him. Douchenozzle. So we're back on home turf, right? Yeah, I kind of want to. Do you mind if you come to the outskirts of the city with us? Great, yeah, come with us. Just Vax knows the way, Vax will you... You know? The spot? Yeah, it's out there. So can we find our way to like a fairly open and not populated part of Whitestone? Nice. This looks like a great place. Now, if you want your first taste of adventure, you need to bring Dottie and come over here. I have to whisper it because it's very secret. Bitch! I rolled a 17. Plus I do want to take him on an adventure. Secret stuff. Are you ready? Where's Dottie? Nice. So put out your hand like this. And take your other hand, and you either make a boulder, a piece of paper, or a pair of shears. Right? And we do it on three. Great, great. It's just to see who goes first. Ready? And on the third one, I cast enlarge with the Titanstone Knuckles, And I smack Doty. (all laugh) Yup. Yeah, just a backhand. 24. It's four, right? Eight, so nine? My strength modifier is eight. See, this is a real good way to figure shit out. Thanks. Nine! Nine damage, yeah. Plus I'm enlarged, so I am probably taller than Doty now. Let's say I hit him, he looks back, and he's looking at my nipples. What happened? That's a wuss panic. How about test? Or every week. Yeah, this was a Tweedledee and Tweedledum. (laughs) 18. Did Doty go down or-- no, he just stood there looking at me afterwards, right? Right. Where is-- Where is Tary Jumbo? I look at him. I hold up my hand and say Show me what you have learned (all laugh) That's it. First time. He has weak capillaries. Awesome. 13. Gimme what you got. LIAM & I have resistance, with my new exalted knuckles. Thank you. What is that? We'll see. That's a new one right? We haven't come up against that before. That is my AC. Beautiful. Nice. I love it. I'm not raging. 19 points of bludgeoning damage. Nice. Right. That was a pretty good hit, and now I'm angry. And I rage. And I walk up so I am within melee-- Actually, I'll go opposite... yeah, on the other side of Tary from Doty. No, no, I wanna be on Tary, opposite of-- Yeah, no, I wanna be-- I wanna put Tary between me and the big robot. Yeah. Yep. Nope. And as I look down, dribbling out of my mouth, I say, Is that it? And that's my turn. Yep. (gasps) Because he asked you to. Sanctuary. What's an AOE? This is amazing. Yeah, we're playing. I raise my hands above my head. Are we not finishing this? Yeah, there's other stuff we need to do. Tary, have you ever passed out from drinking too much? Have you ever been unconscious? Now you're using it too many times. Has Dotty been in any fights, or-- I'm gonna kill him. (all laugh) Much cooler. Less boring. I promise you, none of their dads leave the adventurers' money to their daughters, it's always to the sons. Healing potions, people who look out for each other. Oh, shit. That is a new one. We got him so close to the brink, right? Shouldn't we just introduce him to the deep end so he can say he's been there, and then we bring him up? Yeah. No, no, really, there's something to be said for it. Oh, god. Yeah yeah yeah, he just has to vanquish me. It was pretty weak, actually. Yeah, the rest's just fake it 'til you make it, yeah? Did you build Dotty? Let's open him up and figure out if he's lying. What. We're getting to the deep end! Yeah, of course! (scoffs) No, we would never! No, Tary, what did we say about lying? Wait, bye, Pike! Yeah! Yeah. You go be a monster, and you heal all the people. All right. Okay, bye. That got harder, man, damn. What'd you say? Let me see your hand. Yeah, hold your hand out. Yeah, put it in mine. (grumbling) Is that your real name? Thought you would've made a shitty name like that one up. What's her name? Mary-Anne. Is she older, or younger? Is Mary-Anne older or younger than you? Is she married? Wow... C'mon, note-taker. What about all the jingly-jangly in your bag of holding? I'll just stick my hand in the bag of holding. Candy. (all laugh) This is bullshit! You can't come with us. You better put that out. You burning my hammer? I touch it. Because you said it was magical! You know when people poke you in the sternum with their finger? I do that with the Titanstone Knuckle really hard. You have your strengths, and while you may be able to "read" with your friends over there, I think it's also important to work on your weaknesses. Yeah, so we gotta work on your bravery, maybe your fighting voice. Yeah. When you were flying over the city, did it sound like a llama being mauled by a pack of wolves? That was him. Yeah. Big tall neck, all furry. I can help you with that. The doors don't lock, though, so you have to be on guard all night long. Training is a 24-hour regimen around here. Pretty ragey, yeah. Yeah. I don't. Don't. No. Stop. I don't want you to look in on him. Because he asked us for his own time. Can we respect that or not? Or did you want him to yell at you more when we see him again? Okay, now I'll play. We all healed up? We've never done a sea ship. Time to go finish your Atari. (all laugh) Resistance to a beating? Me? I'm good. I slept really well. Yeah. No? No. Like bad drugs? Me neither. Right, yeah, I think that's very important. I'm not even fighting anyone right now. Where did you find one? You lied? What do you mean? No, no, you gave it to me, it's in my bag. But you said I wasn't supposed to look at it. Phrasing. (all laugh) You want me to get the deck out? All right, I got it. But these are mine! Don't take them from me again! Did you take my salt lick rock? I know. You said, "Don't look at it," and I haven't looked at it. I'm very confused. (all laugh) Do you want a card? I open the flap-- Do you want a card? What're you worried about, it's a deck of cards. Why? I would like to insight check Vex. Six. (all laugh) But I always had it. Is this a lesson? Can we just skip to the part where you get so frustrated that I haven't got it and you just tell me the answer anyway? Yeah. What do you think Scanlan did with the rest of those drugs? Well, you said he was doing drugs, right? Well, did he just take them with him? Ooh, maybe! All right, I put the deck away. 16. 18 minus two. What about nudey pictures? Boring. Ugh. Damn it. Well, there's no drugs. All right. When do I get to look at the cards? Like, never never? Never, never? Yeah, you don't. Only one way to find out! Not today. Fair enough. (gunshots) (surfer accent) Californians. Are we killing these? Sorry, but-- Oh! Okay. Lambchop-looking motherfucker. Lower fangs? Architexture? (quietly) Sick. Vax, you made sure Tary partook of some of the soil here, right? It's an Ashari tradition, right? No, no. He has to eat-- did you? Tary, did you manage to get some of the soil in your mouth? It's a custom here you have to eat the dirt of the earth Ashari. You don't want to be offensive. Yeah. Custom is important. Just stay with it, the first time's the worst. Don't dilute it with any water or anything. You're toughening up already. Ooh, your voice sounds deeper. I like this. I like it. What's wrong with a boat? We haven't been on a boat. Yeah, me too. Thank you. He tap-dances on boats. You do? What are they made of, leather? Yeah, they're made of leather. The channel just-- Oh, jesus. Heartthrob Damon. Run the canal, run the canal. Didn't she just say a good crew? She just said to find a good crew. Barf. I just got shat upon. (laughs) Shat upon. Do I? We killed all the dragons. Can I just ask before we leave, how much are the ships that are for sale? Just let me ask the important questions, you all retire. If I wanted a ship that had, let's say, this many sails, and came with a crew, how much would that be, about? That. 30,000 to 40,000 pieces, that's what I thought. Yep. Thank you. These dock pretzels are amazing. It's not pretty. Really crunchy. Well, let's go get a ship. Are you all right? What kinda weapons you got on this ship? Oh. It's a fast ship? Oh that's true, we have never been in a boat, yeah. What was the boat's name? Anything you can buy on dry land? I've got a couple canisters of underwater breathing that nobody else has. There you go. About what time of day is it right now? Shouldn't we go out early in the morning? Isn't that what you do? You, like, set sail-- What if it's only a three-hour tour? Come on, Tal, you're with me. All right, yeah. I'm fine with that. He pulls out of his waistband-- (all laugh)
