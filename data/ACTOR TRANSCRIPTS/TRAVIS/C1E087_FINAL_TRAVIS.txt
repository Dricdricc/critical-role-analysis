Yeah, sure! The Bennigan's and the Monte Cristo. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles only had Master Splinter. Daniel-san only had Mr. Miyagi. That's a good point. Immediately. Yeah! Yeah he does. It's really good. Cheese is for everybody. Not just me. Cheese. Cheez Its Crust. (all laugh) Shit, we're on a boat. We're on a boat motherfuckers! (gasps) I hear the ocean. Oh that's right. Oh, fuck, it's real when you said it! The non-violent kind. Your imaginary character is also nauseous. That's a bummer. She painted the ocean. It was amazing. First one of the day. Set the tone. Roll like a champion. Why did you go with the weenie one? Can I run to the bow of the ship? Heading for a new land. In New York you can-- No, sorry. (all laugh) What? No, I'm just looking to see what I can see. Like one leg up, Captain Morgan style. Is there one of those amazing naked ladies on the front of the ship? Holding out the pole, that comes out from the front? Come on, Gil. Three. (all laugh) Do we mean to be going backwards? Oh, you can! Bidet. Why are you shouting? We have earrings. Is it? We're sailors now. Yo-ho-ho! And a... help. What? I'm sorry, I get so distracted. Did someone find you? Found you. Hey, do you want to help me? I think there's one of those wooden naked ladies on the front of the ship but I can't really see. Wanna reach a hand around and see if you get a handful of wooden boob? I might not ever ask you again, but right now, yes. No, no, no. What you got down there? Really? Describe her to me in vivid detail. I'm loving this. Man, battle scars? How many breasts? Please say three. Yeah, that's great! Oh, yeah, that'd be good. (giggles) Vax? Vax? Yeah, okay, right, you fell off the ship. Right? Vax? Um?! (all laugh) I think Vax may have fallen overboard. I know it could be a very elaborate joke, but you know that sound when you deuce, and it goes Â (ker-ploop)? (all laugh) That was amazing! You are so drenched right now. Man. Yeah, no seriously, she's that stunning, huh, in the front? I can't wait for the picture. Yeah. Big booby. (all laugh) Big booby. Getting flashes. LAURA and Oh, jeez. Is it clear skies or are we sailing through fog? Right, so we could just look up, and see horror. What? Oh! Oh, right. In a crow's nest? Like a big laundry basket? It's just like-- Called it. Hey, Keyleth? Quick question. Is there a d-- decor-- uh, like a proper way to announce ourselves? Thank you. (laughs) What's semaphore? Holy shit. You're that guy. (all laugh) Yeah, we should have him do that. You should go to the front of the ship-- -- and just make sure they know we're coming. Smart fog. What? Vax, don't try anything. Use what? I can't see you. Do you still have your fucking gills on? Yeah are you like-- And we can see the hooks, right? I would definitely like to go and see the giant sea creature claw that just grabbed onto the boat. Oh! Good news, not a sea monster. Bad news, a big hook that leads to nowhere. Sure. So I'll try and lift the hook off the ship. 15. You know what, I want to see where this leads. I'm going to leave it here. Hey, buddy. Awesome. With your webbed fingers. Right. You ran into our ship! We gonna kill 'em. Boats! Well done, man! Aw. Which one's us? You dingalings. At the bow of the ship, heading for -- Wherever that grappling hook was. Welcoming committee. You need more iron in my diet. You both had 18? Nice. 14. What? Sweet. Hits. Hits also. Nope. Total? Or 12 and 15 both? Gotcha. Bludgeoning. Jesus. It's all right, you've never played this game before. Oh, that's cruel, man. (laughs painfully) Don't do it. Yeah. Into orange juice. (all laugh) What the fuck? No wonder Tary almost died. Assassinate! Ah. Yeah, don't you get advantage on grappled guy? Nobody's tried talking yet? After getting hit by the water elemental, can I go, Hey! What do you want? Fuck it. You got saltwater in my eyes; I would like to rage! I go into a rage. Oh, I hadn't thought about that. (all laugh) Are these at disadvantage? Or I'm right up there? Hey! Reckless attack. 23. Nice. 17. God, those are balls! They're not literal balls. 22. 24. 24 points of damage. You can do better than that. Yeah. Yeah, we tried to talk. What's your AC there, big guy? Ooh. I think you can let that go now. Oh, shit. If you keep at it, you might be able to achieve your goal. Yep, yeah, yep. That's it. Disappointed! Yes! Yes! Damn it! He's fired. Boom! Wow. Damn. From one of the ballistas? Oh, shit. Come on, buddy. Watch this go bad. Yeah! Yeah! Wow. Does he let out a fishy scream? Lift with your knees. Water Jet. He's not? He wouldn't? It really frustrates him. (Trinket groans) (singing) How I survive dragon fights. Super soaker! SAM/ Super soaker 250, super soaker 500, super soaker 1000. You remember those? Strength saving throws. I have advantage because I'm raging. 26. Hit him. Hit him! Shank shank! No more dagger dagger dagger. Did you add your Hunter's Mark? Oh shit! Oh shit! Totally. 100%. Swashbuckling. It was so cool! I wanna keep hitting the water elemental. Reckless attacks, please. First one's a 30. 21 points of damage. Second attack. It's very methodical. 26. Does that hit? And 17 points of damage. Am I not good enough to hold your attention? Yeah, that finishes my turn. Yay! Another play-friend. Hits! Misses. With advantage too? Okay. Wow. This is not the time to choke, buddy. You guys are awful. 21 points. Come on! We should probably protect the captain. What the shit? Don't look at us, man. So put him in the water. Water and water makes-- Yes! Get him! Boat shoes! Oh, yes! Ring of the Ram, that's been a while. Holy shit. 6d10? And that's force damage. You killed it! Back in the drink again! Yeah! Yep. Hits. Okay. Oh, it killed him? A demon? What? Oh, one of them was a-- And there's one hook left. Has the fog not dissipated because fish-head got done with? I go over to the harpoon hook, and like, fuck this harpoon hook. Can I try and get it out of the ship with my strength? Hey. 25. (gasp) I'll pay for that. I feel like I did something bad. Oopsie. Jokes while you're doing that. It's just kids! It's just kids. Kids and puppies! Kids and puppies! Do you wanna check the captain's quarters before it all goes down? Those of you on the boat-- You want me to jump over there and go get the orb? Can I use my boots of Feral leaping to leap from one ship to the other? 22. To jump across. Make my way to the orb. Rip it out. I'm trying to make it to the orb that he was too weak to pull out-- Hah! 25. I got it! Throw it in the water? In the Bag of Holding. And I run, and I try and jump back to the other boat. I'm not gonna make it, but-- 23. (breathing hard) I'm good. I swallowed the coin. Yes! Why didn't you roll the snitch? Yeah. Nice! A fight at sea! We made it off the Titanic! This is stupid, why would you do that? Yeah! [break] Yeah! Fuckin', just cool your jets. Kill him. What is dead may never die! Mr. Theton Groove, is anyone looking for you right now? Oh god. I mean, I second that method, but I'm just seeing if anybody else-- It's deeply immature. I would never do something like that. Probably. I mean, after all, we saved your life, right? You wouldn't be (yells) hiding nothing, would you? See? We got any cages on this boat? Gotta sleep at some point. Sounds fun. Holy shit. He brings up a plate of biscuits and hungrily starts eating. Well, we should introduce ourselves, at least. We are Vox Machina, a travelling group of acrobats, and-- Yep. We do have two smarter members that are not here, Scanlan and Pike, but maybe you'll see them later if you stick with us long enough. Yeah! We got an extra room for him? I believe it's arch-i-pelago. Jot this down! (horn noises) Is there any extensive damage to our ship? Are we still pretty good, other than the railing getting ripped off? What? (all cheer) In the prison cell? I am a powerful magician. And with that, I take out the little gem thing that I pulled off the other ship. You could put it in the guts of Dottie. Yep. But that's not important, that stuff in there. Okay, no, just give it back to me, I'll put it back in the Bag of Holding. Thanks. What? Can I post up outside of the brig where stabbed-in-the-body McGee is sleeping? I'll forego my room. I just want to sleep sitting up. Yeah, just keep the other guard company. Just to give him a little expert help. Yes, snorting. (burps) Ooh. Wow, wow. Cleaning up your-- Amazing. (quietly) Oh shit. Well, I need the boat 'cause I'm heavy. I got my own rowboat. No. Dottie is not coming with me. Yep, see you later. I see adventure over this way! Too bad you won't be there to see it! Not today. Keyleth! Be cooler. That was amazing. I would live there in a second! (excited hyperventilation) No, kill the kraken. Yeah! We're gonna kill a kraken! MARISHA, LIAM, and Holy shit! I have no idea what that means. I don't know what a kraken is like in D&D, but I'm fucking stoked to find out. Yeah, we're not gonna finish it. Nice job, Matt! Nice C! Yo momma is the kraken. Wow. No, no, no, no. Oh god, get us out of here. Are you gonna play?
