Every time! Welcome back, baby! Where'd you get that great t-shirt you're wearing? And they got really good stuff. You got your t-shirt from Loot Crate, Voltron. Yes! Yeah! Back in the pilot chair. We're in trouble. Six. All right, I'm ready to go! Yeah, do we have to wait long, because I have the pee. You know? Where you're like hide-and-go-seek pee? Feywild. What a dicklord. You did not throw out the paper. You piece of shit. Why did you throw it away? What a fucking-- What? What level are you doing? Inception. This is amazing. Who's yes? Whoa! Me? So it's mine? What? Those are like amazing things. There's a petrified crocodile. What else did you see while we were in this magical place? What? Thank you. We just left there. Yeah. Wait, if you got a bow, and there were pixies, and you gave her something, did I get anything? Did I pick up any diseases? Can I insight check Scanlan? Six! That's pretty great. I like all those things you said. Did I get any new weapons? I won't be able to pull it out of the bag of holding unless I know what's in there. I don't have pockets. Oh fuck! I mean, oh fuck! A little statue of a dog. Can I reach into the bag of holding for an onyx statue of a dog? 11. If you want to reach in here and reach in my bag. Oh. It has an intelligence of eight. Six. Get to the bottom part, come on. If you set camp though, good sentry. All right, we start walking back to Whitestone. Do we smell? Oh, shit. Amongst a horde of dragonborn. Did you see any motion? Any slaves? This white dragon, does he bring weather, or any sort of change? It's all ice and snow, yeah? I'm going outside. 17. Fucking fucked. This is his home. I'll be right behind him. He said they're curving. What direction are they looking? Shall we scatter? Spread the word? We're scattering. Fucking ziggurat! Looks like the spell worked. Yeah. Apparently, we went to the Feywild, and everybody remembers it but me and Percy. I'm just too smart. What do you see? Don't make me any dumber. (surprised noises) I got petrified! I tried diplomacy! Never again. Holy shit. No, it's okay, yeah! Percy will remember the nude massage. I forgot that Shaun was Gilmore's first name. Well, we've got a few of these Vestiges, so we're a little powered up. But we're not quite sure what their full abilities are. It's significant, but we think they do more, we're just not sure how much. Can't you tell what direction the dragons were heading? So not back, they came from the west, right? To the west. To answer your previous question, there are four Vestiges left. Ooh! Yeah, yeah! Your parents. In another plane of existence, which I don't know if that's a problem. Yeah, we need more offence, less defense. I don't know if that will work a second time. Best not to mention our name. I don't think we're cool with the Clasp after our last meeting. Yes. Strange that he had all those wyverns with him, though. Umbrasyl had none. He was by himself. Yeah, but didn't they say the white one was more savage. More emotional? Can we ask, why would it bring retaliation? How would they know it was us? What if we don't sign it? When we killed the first one, there were a bunch of jewels in the wall and we saw a bunch of eyeballs. I insight check Jarett. Seven. Well I was looking for a Loot Crate. Have you guys seen any Loot Crates? That's incredible! How do I get one of those? Oh shit, hold on. I reach into the bag of holding and I grab five expensive-ass bottles of wine. Well, I've a question. If I were to call somewhere a City of Brass, where would you think that would be? We were already there once, actually. Well, look, the Plate of the Dawnmartyr is in a City of Brass, but I don't know where that is. Draconia is in Wildemount? Right. And so is the big white fuck, right? The City of Brass? Worse than the Fire Plane? Wait, isn't that where the rakshasa's going to be? Who's got a map? Where's the Ozmit Sea? Which direction is it? Towards Draconia? Well, look, hey, so I have an idea, right. Someone mentioned that the white dragon is very vain and very savage. He's got like all those wyverns around him. That's a little bit of a bitch for us. We're usually good one dragon on all of us. You got a whole gang, worse for us. So what about if we played to his vanity, and maybe sent him knocking on one of his Conclave brother's doors. Maybe start a little beef that maybe's not there. I don't know, the idea just popped up. I'm looking for your help and shit. You know how tired I am right now? Wolverines! Yeah. Scanlan. Keep thinking about it. You'll be the Hercules Mulligan of Vox Machina. Are we at all just forgetting the fact that Draconia is lying in ruins? How far away is Draconia from here? Travel wise? Doesn't Draconia have an army there? If there are any survivors, anyone we can bring back to Whitestone, shouldn't we be accumulating those people? We're sneaky, we're so sneaky! Yeah! Pike's not even here. No, no that was personal. Yeah, no, look I'm not trying to pick a fight with a dragon, I'm just going to make sure that dragonborn are there and we can help them. Wow. Well, listen. Again, I'm not trying to kill the white dragon. I want him to go pick a fight with the other dragons. You guys don't know how to pick a fight? You honestly can't brainstorm one way to pick a fight? I would talk mad shit to the white dragon on behalf of the green dragon. I would rep the green dragon. I'm just saying, I feel like an opportunity's being wasted here. Fine. Someone else do the thinking. I bet you could do a lot of incredible things. Or maybe even statues where Umbrasyl's nest was. Do we know how they communicate? Gilmore, Asum, do either of you have a theory on how they communicate? They were broken already. I'm only saying, maybe it's empty, right? Draconia. I'm only saying, if they were just here-- Get people out, do recon, whatever. SAM and I'm just pointing out an opportunity where there is one. A few days? We would have a whole fucking day! Why not wyverns? When else are we going to know for sure? Yeah, I know an ancient dwarven one that says no risk... Thank you. Disrupting communications is a great tactic. You don't think we're going to make it to the jewels and smashy-smash? Oh man. I can find all sorts of problems with a situation if I look hard enough. Opportunity. Honestly. There's a dragon's perch, and he is vacated, and it will probably never happen again as far as we know. Cool. While they're killing Whitestone because we didn't take advantage of this moment, then we'll go to Draconia. I pounce on it. Yeah. Should we put it down? Who are we talking about? (laughter) Oh. Why? We know about Tiberius. We know about Kruvanis Stormwind. Not great. Oh, are we asking for Grog's opinion now? I think we should take the hint and not go. Yeah, but I was picturing meandering out of a nice, beautiful tree in a forest. I do hate to have my own words used against me. I'm down to party. I'm just saying it was a little different in my head. I'll go first. You hold my hand, and I'll go first. I'll go. Let's do it. I'm ready. Does the portal only close after a couple seconds? All right, sweet. I am, too. Should you make me some something teensy? Yes! That's awesome. 17! Oh. 27. 27. Am I right under Percy? (laughs) Yep. 13. I got a booby. Pike's a small monster. We're going to crack out the good old Dust of Tracelessness since there's knee-high snow? What is the definition of this word? (speaking in Japanese) Keeping an eye out for trees. Oh. Are there any frozen bodies? Oh, I rolled a ten. Are there any trees that we can see as we're walking? Hey, 19! I did! Might be a long way, though. (moans) (laughter) Do not answer that question. We follow. Can I ask a question? The bodies on the spikes. None of them look familiar, right? A big icy dog bed. The highest point. Nine! If we do, then we violate what we said we were going to do. That's amazing. I used my last magic poo to look at my daughter! I have a suggestion. The white dragon is primal, right? He likes to hunt creatures. We've got to go now. We leave. We leave them alone. That way we're not in danger, they're not in danger. We promise to come back, not only with forces to help remove the white dragon, but also with something for it to hunt. That way we're not fighting it in its fucking lair. We know that there are people that will work with us. We know what the terrain looks like. We know what his lair looks like, which we don't want to be in when we fight him. And we know how to get him out of it, possibly. It's a pretty successful trip. How about a little wine? They did want trees. I like the tree idea. Tooma. Forgive me, I'm not the best speaker, but we have learned from fighting these dragons that if we fight them in their lair, we are at a severe disadvantage. We are of a mind on that. If you can get away from the city-- Oh no. Oh jeez. Oh man, I love it. Yeah. I go and I gather the remains. I have a horrible thought. If we move him, will the dragon know we were here? Where should we bring him? We take him back to where the frozen books lay. I'm going to take a chalice out of the bag of holding, and I begin to fill it with ale, and then remember he preferred water, and I take the alchemy jug and I pour fresh water into the chalice and lay it with him. Pour one out for Tibs. We will be.
