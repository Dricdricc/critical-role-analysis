(vomiting noises) Would you like some? Well, we all died, so. Oh, make it sooner! Check it out everywhere. First weekend of March. That was a new level. I love her. (laughter) (Texan drawl) Yeah, I'm here too. (laughter) Green skin tone, and got some piecemeal armor put together and stuff. My name's Fjord. Thank you. Appreciate that. We can't accept this, right? I mean, it's too much. I think you're supposed to do it if you say it. Fine, fine. Can I clock the room, see who else is watching her count? Is this the first roll? Natural 20. (cheering) Well, I actually did pretty good at that card game, so you can have mine. That's creepy. Fucking disgusting. I think we have people watching us. Well, just take a look right over there. You're being mighty fucking friendly. They were looking at our coin. I didn't think of that. Pork belly, if you have it. One of your characters? No. The tent. Did they die in the show, or from watching it? She didn't say much. Was he using magic? Jester, don't you remember us talking about keeping a low profile? Could you put him over there? I'm pretty sure he's a real fucking cat. Well, I mean, a little. Trying to learn more. Thanks, Jester. She's better at it than I am. We're trying to make our way up to the Academy to get a little bit more learning done. Well yeah, it's the place to be. Solstryce Academy. You know. You know it. And you have arcane talents as well. (sneezes) Do you know anything about it? We're just going up. Beginner's luck. No. Somebody has a gambling problem. Maybe you could give some of it back. What the fuck is a vole? What else is there? We did, yeah. We get bored pretty easily. Maybe not out loud say that. Just a thought. I don't have a problem with goblins, but you guys aren't in any trouble, are you? No one's after you? Can I make an insight check? 13. Good to know. Annabelle. (laughter) It seems we have all day. What were your plans? Didn't leave on the best of terms. Laryngitis every Friday. (laughter) I might just wait for the carnival, actually. I love how your fiddle noises were "beedle-deedle". Face is on fire. Bring that ass back. Now I want to see the show. Hah. That's an interesting choice. Sure. My falchion. 11. Fucking lead the way. The birds are out already. There's no benches? Oh, fuck. Carnival? I don't know. (laughter) Yasha? We're going to need those weapons back. Not part of the show. First map! (yelling) 12. Can I run up with the falchion within melee? Ripping the falchion, can I swing it into the creature? I do? Thank god, because that was a one. 18. Nice. 11. Take a shot? This thing's swinging hard. Holy shit. That is 16. Nice. That is 12 points of damage. Shit. I'll turn and head towards other tree-zombie fuck. I would like to use my bonus action to cast Hex on it. I would like to use my falchion to open it the fuck up. 21. That's 12 points of damage, plus five points of necrotic damage. Is it made of piano wire? (laughter) In this moment? First one! Yasha, have you ever seen anything like this happen before? What are the corpses doing now that they've fallen? Put your hands down. You're not even ready. You should know that whatever happened to that first man when he attacked the woman, she caught whatever he had. They don't have watches yet. We did. Bo. (laughter) You pointed at me. The Nestled Nook Inn. I have an intelligence of 14. I know what I'm doing. Holy shit. Yeah, totally new dice. What are you talking about? I'm a ballerina.
