A bit like a process of divination-- (laughter) Don't lose your wits down here, it's real important. I forgot what it was you left to go do, actually! (laughs) Right! How do you say it? Ear-in-es. Wait, you said they like left you alone once you changed into that thing? Well, why didn't you just keep going, then? Ohh. Yeah, don't you, like, brainy buddies just like exchange notes every day, anyway? It was upstairs in the-- I forgot about that. I kept a ring off that demon that we killed. It's in the bag of holding. Yep. Why, what do you want? You! You! I'm not going to fall for that! So that big demon, that like body slammed me on that spike? Piece of shit. I took this ring off of his finger, forever ago. And I kept it. I take it out. Sorry, that's from like, three years ago. That's one of the oldest things in this bag. There's only one other thing that's older. It's an onyx statue that we found down in the cell that you were in. Can we use it? Is it something that'll get us like, a backstage pass to an audience of some kind? It's mine, don't forget. Yep, me too. 13! If you're curious, the person it belonged to is dead. We killed him. How is that a pun? That's a stretch. Are we doing it on our own? (laughs) Yeah, Vex! That's true. Yeah, but Keyleth, once we're arrested, he's supposed to, like, shuffle us in, y'know, on the low-low, into-- Yeah. Because we have no other plan at this point. You were supposed to go find something, (singsong) but you got followed by demons. Oh? What if the guy he wants us to kill is like a real piece of shit? Does anybody have a problem with that? It's just like, y'know, piece of shit (killing noise), and he's gone. Thank you, Tary. Okay. We kill him, too. Did he ask, like, a decision by a certain time? Well, fuck, we've got a day! Let's go explore, see what we can find. Not the ring! God, not the ring-- I mean, I, fuck, I totally forgot about that ring until now. Yeah, I need it back. Me? I'm going to wear it! Yeah. Does it fit on any of me giant, Oscar Meyer fingers? (laughter) Property of Asmodeus! Ass-modeus-- Oh, wait, you ready to go? Vax, you got any problem with that? What about you? Do you have like a magic jock strap you can rip off and change into something? Not me, bitch. Oh. Thank you. Hi! Yeah, do you want to take the contract? And we go kill (burps) big shit guy and go to prison? Or do we try and, like, take a day and see what we can find on our own, without giving ourselves over to this-- arrangement? Yeah, you are. Vax. What's your vote? Uh-huh. We were? Yeah, fucking speak up. I mean, what are our chances of walking around town and going like, 'hey, that prison, 'right? Right over--'? All right, time for a vote! Tary, what's your vote? Percy? Percy, what's your vote? Keyleth? Keyleth! I don't need an explanation, jesus. Okay. Vax? Vex? I vote for taking the contract! Me and Tary, we're of a like mind. Bullshit. All right, we take the day. Giant grizzly bear. Just pick one. Oh right. Son of a bitch! This is really nice now. All right. Let's go. Wow. Eject! Eject! All right, she's gone. Do you want to what? Yeah. Oh yeah, but can you be the erinyes and locate-- thing at the same time? Yeah, what if somebody comes up to you and like, thinks you're somebody and you're not, and then you gotta, like, talk. Oh. Not me. All right, fine. 30. Very expensive. Do you want me to give it a look? Buzz. (resigned) Sure. I'll do it. Why? Right. It's Vegas, man. He don't give a fuck. What about snow cones? What the fuck? If I just had a little piece of the White House, I could just-- (snaps)-- right to it. They get there first, though. Yeah, he had a tiger-skin hoodie. Wow. Hands in your pockets, Tary. Shit. Yrat. Yrat. It's your name backwards, right? What? Oh, it hurts. Ow! (laughter) Ow. (laughter) (yells) What? Bidet. Yeah, yes! I do. That's good. I mean, we're in here. Yeah, I just want the one walkie talkie that doesn't have a pair. Don't we want the purple gobstopper? TALIESIN AND Why? That's coin around here, though. We might need it. Oh, motherfucker. How much for the pretty? Yeah, yeah. Autobots-- Oh, now we're carefree! Oh good, I love it! So, nothing? Are they up in-- We went up to the room, right? Does anybody want to try the meat stuff downstairs? Why? But you don't know. I don't. I'll be right back. I go downstairs. Yup. Are they wearing armor and shit? Okay, good. Hey, that stuff, right, that normal people have. Can I have like, a little plate of it? Oh, that's very kind of you. See? Look, experimenting with new cultures is really quite nice. New tastes and all. What does it look like? Very red. Mm. Tenderized. Wode, would you want any of this? Okay. I'll take one of the little bones out, and I spoon together like, a good chunk like spaghetti on a fork. And I pop it right in. No, no, I'm using the bone as the utensil. Like chewing on pennies. Ah. Ah. Fucking hell. Do I feel high? Like Freddie did when he consumed the little orb of-- ? Hey! Yeah, it really fights back as you eat it. You know? It kind of tastes like if you took a bunch of rusty nails and then shoved them in your thumb and then sucked on that for a while. Yeah. Have you done that before? Have you not? Okay. Yeah. I have another bite. My plate of flesh. My compliments to the chef. That tasted like forearm. Okay, I'm good. Wode, do you want to go back up-- (hiccups) -- stairs? It's not for everyone, yeah. Cook is right there, literally. Sorry. Okay. Yeah! Yeah! Cool. Yep, that sounds right. Yrat, that is most noble of you. You truly are earning your place here. Yrat, you will be a hero to many. Give him a pen. Okay. (laughs) Not that one! Not that part. That's pact two. Holy shit. Can we please go sign this contract? Hey, cool! Can we-- What? What you got? Oh. Do it. Do it now, do it quickly. Arm wrestle. D. Rolo. Pact! [break] Only one of us is locked in. We bumblefucked our way into it, got super super lucky-- No. And smart. Very smart. I lost a lot of hit points actually today. I could use a recharge. Natural 20. How am I feeling? The stuff downstairs is really not that bad. Yes? Don't judge it until you try it. Do we see the imp downstairs anywhere? Close it down for a bit, did you? Okay. That was sour. Boy, that sure sounds like food. We would be running on the blazing hot ground. And flying in the imp-covered air. It's all in the contract. We go. We follow. Do we need Pass Without A Trace? Motherfucker. Natural 20. Two in a row. 25. With the plus ten? Come on, golden snitch. You can certainly try. Oh, like raptors. Come on, Percy, for fuck's sake. 23. Okay. Whoa. That was easier than I thought. You can put Doty in there. I farted while I was inside. It's only five feet high. I'll do it. 15. Nice. You do what? Does she look like she regrets her decisions in life? Oh no! Come on in, come on in! Let's not fight, just heal her. I'll do it. 12. Yeah, let's not give too much info. Yeah, Tova, did you have a weapon when you were brought here? Yeah, what'd you have? Really? Should we look around the room for the maul? Not to slow your roll or nothing but I have a greatsword if you want one. Okay. Are you sure you can handle a greatsword? It's, like, big league. What the fuck happened to your face? Shit. I fall flat on the floor. Oh, that's good. A 19 and a 20. A natural 19 and a natural 20. So, 21, 31. 14. Blow the cover for everyone. Yeah! Awesome. Your brother? Wow. Wow, that's like six in one-- I'm keeping count. That was nine swears in one turn, that was good. Oh, really? (yells) (yells) I do a burpee off the floor. I take off running through the doorway! I see him, and I say hi. And I rage. Yeah. And I'm going to hit him twice! Reckless, please. That is-- (laughs) 24. Nice. Nine-- Wait, there it is. 21. Yes. And the second one. Reckless. Thank god. Because that was a one. 20-- 31. Jesus-- 11-- 23. 23 points of damage. Nope. Oh, I don't have anything else to do. That was it-- my bonus action already. Following your partner. I like "on me" better than "roll out!" It is hell. I smushed his head. Smarter, handsomer, more stealthy-- Cool. It's a gamble. Eat it. No, there's one running. Down the hallway to the right. Left. Direction. That's a really good roll for Trinket. I run after-- I run after winged she-bitch. Yeah. Two, please. Reckless! 33. Okay. Oh, I reroll that, because that's a one. That's a two. 18. 18 points. Reckless. 36. 23 points of damage. Your turn, buddy, come on. Show me what you got. Oh, nice job. You should open your eyes, though. Run in like a bull and fart on the wind? Cut the throat? Bull? Flapping wings? Earache? Pokey poke. I can hear you whispering. I don't know why you-- Oh, he's on the other side of the wall. Oh. Why didn't you just say that? What's this Tutonka thing you're doing? I don't understand. Can I keep going, down the hallway? Tary was screaming like a woman. It was just very high-pitched, is what I mean. Except it gives away our position in this endeavour. Since I'm the closest, can I step up into the doorway and see what I see? 19. Yeah! I had advantage already, but that's cool. Do I see anything through the doorway, from where I'm standing? Yeah, this'll be good. Oh! Hey, 18! I do have Darkvision. Ooh, it's like an invitation. Now that I see him, can I look to my left, down the rest of the hallway? A-fucking Jenga. (laughter) Nope. Just an hour and 40 minutes to sign a contract. Yeah!
