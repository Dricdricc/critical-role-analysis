Where do they go to do that? At the Geek and Sundry website? I'm the dog. (laughter) Much to come. LAURA and Make the beat drop. We fucking run. There's a shit-load of skeletons behind us. Dust of Tracelessness? I would advise bringing them with us instead of stopping. Shit happens. Keep that cast hand feeling firm. Can you see any giants from up there? Are you sure? I look at Scanlan and I say, go get her, and I grab Scanlan by the back, and I throw him up onto the wall. Athletics. Oh, shock. We should have fucking run. Can I make it around the wall? 19? 12 and seven. Can I reach them? "Tee time!" And I rush up with the war hammer and swing. Like Happy Gilmore. Tea time. That's a 26. Okay, I don't know... Okay, 11. 12? Oh, just 11. Yeah. 20. (laughs) 16. 22. I'm also not raging. Well let's throw some shit, then. 25. Ten... 14. 13. Yeah. Never know a place until you lick the mud. (pained noises) Now I know what we're looking for. Two. Or kill them. I'll go. I'll take the gnomes on my shoulders. (laughter) Grog and the two gnomes will run south. The treeline. Pike, do you want to help him? All right, we stop and let Pike down. Going to step on his throat after she's done. 23? Run. Now. I like him! I pick Pike back up, put her on my shoulder, and we keep running. Boss. Yes! Me too. 16. Put the stank on this guy. Wow. This is my jam! (laughter) At his right leg, yeah-- I aim at the back of his right knee. 17? Should I roll damage first? Or all three. 26? 24, sorry. And 19. 22 for the first one. 13 for the second one. 15 for the third one. (singing) Now we got Grog's blood. (laughter) Yes, yes! 27, halved. Oh, the hit. Got you. Damn. Yeah, I'm just getting a warm-up right now. 17. Vaporize this motherfucker. (laughs) Cross the streams! (laughter) But I'm a good person. Did I take any damage? Would you like to go? Sweet. If he's starting to lean down, I want to take his head and turn it into a tee-ball target. Yeah, but then he gets advantage. I didn't do it on the last one. Let's do it! Why not? Okay. We'll do great weapon master. We'll use it on that one. That's even worse. 16? Oh good, okay. 16 again. That'll work. 26. Kill it with fire. Sorry. Ten, 11, 21-- I did it, yeah. That was 11 plus ten. 15, so 25. 18, 23, 33. Dibs! (laughter) Shove my hand up your skull and work you like a sock puppet! (laughter) Yeah. Nice natural 20. Put some hurt on this undead bastard. He's always doing that. Welcome back, Pike. We're the deliverers of this town. Go. Spread the word. It all comes down tonight. Tonight, tomorrow, tit for tat. Whatever. It goes down in the next-- Don't put a timeline on it. These things-- it takes a little time. Aye, with the de Rolos. Yeah, they don't want them to come back. Do we want to stay, or do we want to head back towards the other three? That's right. We should head to the west, to the wall. To the city wall. Can we roll hit dice at any time during the day? Got it. Maybe they're terribly irresponsible. No Dust of Tracelessness this time as we head to the western wall. We're getting bold! 90 feet. That's just rude. You literally are a monster. "Oh, I'm sorry. 26." Come on, Shadow Turd. Same thing. Guards. I haven't had a natural 20 in the game. In a long time. Except when I head-butted a fomorian. No, you keep your Golden Snitch. Harry Potter. I'm laughing. Bad News or Pepperbox? Pile of undead goo. Yeah, there was a 12 and I was like, what? There you go. Fucking do it. LAURA AND Do whatever you want. I'm not here. I'm not even here. By its designated flower girl. We're against the wall? Should we stay in the treeline? Actually, Percy's just fine. Maybe she looks at him after the Briarwoods. Percy, how are you feeling? Oh, us, too. Hey, Pike. Do you want to take Percy's temperature? Yeah! Oh. Really? I get plus two to stealth? 18. It's certainly the die, and not you in any way. We should be very careful. These two are good at using their brain muscles. Could be an ambush. What? Wait, say that again? I suppose. I go and I start moving rocks. Never forget. 18. Hey, look! I found a hole. Are there trees around us? You don't think they'll patrol this area? Are we in the tunnel? I grab some of the boulders and cover up the way we came in. Or just a boulder, and move it to the mouth of it. Or is it too big? Yeah, just to cover it up a little. Oh, Keyleth? Can you make a fucking bush grow in front of this thing? So if whoever was going by with those dogs while we were up in the trees the first night we got here comes by and sees a hole in the wall... A what? Yep. Drop your pants. Can you do me next? My neck has been hurting for weeks. Oh, it's much better. Fuck him. I go to sleep. (laughter) Oh, ten. (loud snoring) And I cough, and the stones shoot out of my nose back at Vax. (laughter) Covered in Grog "boge." (laughter) Be careful when you go to sleep. Shit falls in your nose. Leave it to the guardian. This is true. I did. You can fuck off and get yourself killed. (snores) (laughter) I let out a little sleep fart. 18? 17. Don't fucking touch me! You're all cuddly in the morning and shit. God, get it together. I lean over to Vex and I go, how do I look? Damn right. What if they don't take the rebels seriously because we're not with them? Maybe one of us should go. We could meet in the middle. (laughing) "Holy shit, it's delicious." (laughter) Do we want to check the wall? Can someone check to make sure that it's just a statue? Yes? Where? Up where? Oh! (whispering) Oh. And I gently start to push the statue out of the way. That's a one. I slide down and go, you know, I'm so tired of (groans) taking all the glory. Why don't you guys-- Can I have Trinket step on my lower back, please? (groans) Thank god. Shouldn't we ask Percy what he wants to do? 26. No? They don't take prisoners. Yeah, they don't take prisoners, they don't take prisoners. Why isn't she fucking dead? Or undead? Why is she not dead? Why is she not undead? No, you're fucking staying in that cell, and if things go bad upstairs it won't matter if you're in there or not. Is it? Leave her. Hold up. I step forward now behind Scanlan. Super fucking intimidating. If things go well upstairs, we'll be back. If when we leave, you make a peep, you won't ever again. 14. Was it a magical whip or just a rope? I think it was the straw on the bottom of her cell, right? Yeah. Me, too. Because she's not hungry, because she hasn't been in there for a while. I walk back up to the old woman. Not hungry or thirsty, I take it? Keep you well-fed here, do they? Yeah, have a little nibble. Have a little nibble. It's good. Because I don't trust you, old woman. That's a great idea. Yeah, I fucking bite into the meat of my hand because I see what she's trying to do. Just (chomp). Drip a little. Oh no. Some nice type AB. Right here. On tap. No? Clean blood. Feel yourself tempted?
