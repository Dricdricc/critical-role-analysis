Who was that strange masked man just now? Happy Birthday, Kit! The Justice League thing! Lex Luthor, and you play Superman. That's the best. Aw, yeah! Jumped on the jam, boogie-woogie jam-slam. Really? (sings) In Tampa. Tampa, Florida. How many did we have to go? When is the next giveaway? The world just ended. Is that at the water park? Son of a bitch. The dysentery afterwards is-- We were. I'm grappled, so. (laughs) I would like to, just because these things ate my fucking mind away. Seven. Oh, it's a 12! I looked at acrobatics. Tiberius, if he fucks us. Oh, I'm grappled! I'm raging, but. Fuck yes! Intelligence saving throws? Thank god I rolled high. (laughs) I get a negative two modifier, that's such bullshit. (laughter) 17. Oh. 17. I passed, right? Son of a bitch, taint, fuck! I never trusted that Magneto motherfucker! Fuck. Eight. Against mind flayers. We're fucking fighting brains and mind flayers again. Tiberius has got something for us, right? We're still in it. Or it could happen really quick. If someone asks you if you're a god-- You shouldn't look! You shouldn't waste your time. That one, the second one. The second one, close the doorway. I thought he said it was big. Yeah, do it. Fuck it, do what you want to do. Aw. (groans) God! Maybe not now, they don't? Beam us out, Scotty. Oh god. Fuck that horn. Remember our days watching Saved by the Bell together? Whose? We're just trying to stay alive. Yeah. Prison shank that thing. Can you scream out "lobotomy" while you do it? Yeah, I'm getting a massage right now. Don't you touch my friend. A natural 20? Come on, buddy. (cheering) Cardiac kid, come on now, here we go. Table's getting hot. Residual? Natural 20 residual. I've got to break my grapple, right? One. The axe is across the room, remember? Well that's a good, that's a good plus. I can attack with the chain? I have no-- it's holding me, I don't think I can be like-- I was going to try and save you. Can I reach the illithid-- it's far? Where's Scanlan? All right, I can't-- I'm going to try and throw it at the illithid that's on Scanlan. 22? Okay, it's just one, two, three. Shit balls. 14. No, I'm done. Yes, I would like to. What do I, what the fuck do I roll, to the thing. What do I roll? A 12? Okay, good. (laughter) (laughs) The 12 was a one. (laughter) What did he do? I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota. (laughter) Every week! Who's up? Come on! Yes! That was the worst Schwarzenegger action line ever. (Terminator voice) Hope they have flood insurance, ja. Holy shit. That was amazing. Unless Tickle-me-Elmo is holding you by the cage. A tentacle frown. I thought she closed the door. I'm so ashamed right now. (Tiberius voice) Poppycock, poppycock. Yes! Blow everybody. (laughter) Oh, Percy! Come on, Perce! He's sucking head. 50-- Let's not even say the number. We're coming real close. I think I'm going blind in my left eye. Yeah, totally. You're better off than six, right? I can't not do it. Can you get us out of here? Getting us out. You do what you want. Okay. I'm already there. I'm just being fucking grappled. Is it my turn? Oh, can I try it for the third time to break free? I'll use the inspiration die just in case I rolled balls again. It's athletics, right? 18. So is everybody leaving? Should I climb up the rope? Fuck Lady Kima! Okay, cool. I pick her up and start trying to climb up the rope. She's stone! It doesn't matter! I take her and-- oh, fine. I'll hold on to her. I would like to climb. I would like to rage. Rage climb. 17. You better remember this when you wake up. (laughter) Fudge. Come on, punch it in its big brain anus. Vax, you're still on the floor, right? She's on Trinket. I'm at 32. Heal yourself. Just do your thing. You need it. The DM recommends it. (laughter) I stringently urge you. I can keep flying up? I have one more level three, whatever it's called, level three healing potion. They're called called superior or something? What's the word for it? I'd like to take that. I heal 24 points of hit damage. Fuck this house of horrors. Well, we woke it up. Do what you were going to do. Do it. (laughs) No, lies. Wait, you're saying brains are made of water? Crush the nuts. What? Yeah, turn into a batwing. We're getting out, right? So I don't have to worry, so up and out. Is he the dumbest? Oh, fuck. I just caked my pants. Chocolate cake. Just a quick request she is made of stone. Holding Lady Kima. Hold on. Sure, yeah. Do you want to teleport it in the bag? Did you wink? Gesundheit. Would you say it's a beautiful sight? I ruin it with a fart. (laughter) I've had horrible stomach pains this whole time, I'm sorry. Yes. Oh, right. Really? You mean it? It's all empty, can we fill it please? And the stone gnome. And stone Kima. Let's put her in the bag. She's made of stone! She's stone. Stone doesn't breathe. Right? Ah, yes! I put a fancy robe around Kima's stone statue. We lived! Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale! No. He's drunk. Yes. Hoo baby. We ate already, right? So let's send a pigeon or something. And he's asleep. He's sleeping. Do we tell her, do we tell her we have the Horn? Or do we not? Thank. God. I would like to eat. I take Lady Kima's portions and I-- Never know. Yeah, Allura's going to unfreeze Kima. Why don't we just hold onto the Horn for a second and see what they do without it. We just hold onto it in the bag. Do you want to wake up, do you have something important to say? All right, fuck it, I walk over and I take the rat out of Vax's hands and I shake it awake. I shake it a lot. I spit on Tiberius's head and rub it in vigorously. Vex has a question for you. Isn't that what Kima wanted? It needs the Sword of Gryffindor. You did kill a dragon. Let's stay on topic here. Yeah, I think they do. Put it in the bag. How about we rest, we put the Horn in the bag, we wake up Kima, we go, "Oh, we brought you back, sorry we don't have the Horn. If we did, what would you do with it?" And then we decide what we do. We can't say destroyed because we don't know how we did that, right? That's fine, but if we ask like what she would've done if we had it, and when she leaves we go, "Hah, we have it." Yeah, if she wants to study it or use it or transform it into something, we don't give it to her, we try to destroy it ourselves. If she wants to banish it and do something that Tiberius is happy with, then we go like, "Hey, we have it." Nothing it can, we took out all the stuff it can turn into some like evil transformer or something. Everything has out with parentheses next to it. One person should leave with it. I'll leave with it. Yeah, I'll leave. It's not like I'm going to talk to the sorcerers. Yeah, you're a talker, I'm not. No, I'll just hang out outside. Shall we sleep? I put my head right in my food and fall asleep. Yeah, Minxie! It's like when you take a cast off, you're like, ugh. I start awake with food on my face and I wipe it off and eat it. "I had a horrible dream "about two walking testicles that were hurting my mind." I had a feeling something was coming. I've got it. I look in the bag of holding and I see a Horn? Yeah, put it back in. Thank you, tie it up tight. I'm going to go down to the, what is it, the temple below the thingie? All right, I'm going to go play in the dark with myself. That sounded wrong. Just because I'm nervous, I reach into the Bag of Holding and pull out a vial of holy oil that I have. I have three vials of holy oil and I just hold it in one hand while I'm down there. Yeah. Oh, the things I sacrifice for the group. Yeah, I feel pretty good about this. (sings) I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts. Oh yeah? Is it clear? Did she ask about me? With my bald head. Hello, Lady Kima. Yeah, more than alive, I think. Oh, stop, I don't like to brag. Yeah, well, you know. You could use my room. Thank you. You're rushing to the airport tonight? You're rushing to the airport tonight? You're going to do the waterslides, right? You won't ride waterslides? One roll away from her being-- Twice. Horse head. Evil horse head of doom. $250? No it's not. Are you fucking kidding me? Skulls! It's made of skulls. I rolled an eight.
