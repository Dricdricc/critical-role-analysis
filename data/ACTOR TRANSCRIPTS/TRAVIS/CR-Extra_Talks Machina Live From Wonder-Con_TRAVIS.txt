I think we had two solid years of playing, so we knew what our game was, we knew who our characters were. We knew how much we hate each others' guts and how irreverent we are. We don't give a shit what anybody thinks. Right, that's true. Once we got used to the random-ass cameras being in the room, we keep doing our thing. Live shows are totally, that's another thing. There's a lot of people out there. You do?! I mean, we drink a lot. Water. We drink water a lot. Yeah, we have rituals for that. All the profanities that we throw to you right before we go live? It's our way of going, welcome, Matt! No, leave the question alone. It's done. Man, we're Seal Team Six, shut up! You sounded like the Joker just then. That was amazing. I plan to play a pigeon next. I'm going down. I'm not going up. Intelligence of six? I'm coming to three. Our old nemesis. We don't plan on doing anything good. Are there brothels in Hell? Oh my god. Boo this man! "Your secret is safe with my indifference" is one. Ale. Get arrested once a year. Everything's hot and it burns. The food is not that bad. Ooh. I would require a rap battle between one Scanlan Shorthalt and one Lin Manuel Miranda. To drop some lyrical rhymes! The winner could be my inspiration maker. They package them together a lot. Step into the light! Yeah, I caught that. I did it right at the same time, I was like, Agh! It hurts! No. No. Deck of Many Things! What you fools haven't realized is that I have amassed all the magical power in the universe. I'm going to kill all of you. I'm going to hot-glue it all to an oven mitt and be like, I am now the strongest in the world! We got dried poo in that bag. Yeah, there's like three pieces in there. You know, some people collect sand from different beaches? I got to take poop. Nah, you're fine. Just throw it from where you are.
