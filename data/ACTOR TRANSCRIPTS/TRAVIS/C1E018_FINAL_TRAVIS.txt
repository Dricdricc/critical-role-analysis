Silly? [dramatic music] He's here! (cheering) Like Superman, that was amazing. Newbie! I'm going to kill you. Well that's a lot of us, actually. Really? (loud maniacal laughter) All right, but I'm not Phillip right now, he lost. I'm a winner. (cries) Phillip is training to an 80s training montage right now. In a beef locker somewhere. Yep. Yeah. Do they have a weapons closet? Oh shit, I thought we were in the guildhall. Scanlan. Do you want anything from the tavern before we leave? What time is it? Get rid of it. Put it down. Bye Vax! (laughs) He always mixes those fingers up. Oh yeah! I've got lots of shit. We have a salt lick rock, we've got three firewood bundles, dried food rations... There's... two. Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't smell bad. I mean, I've got my hooded lantern, but you can't have that. It's dark in places. Two pieces of armor. Just armor Ooh. We've got dried food rations in the bag. Roll good, you're starting us off. Roll good. Roll good. Stingy motherfucker! Like two-nine? Awesome. He's a little what? Lucky chap. Kord's strength to you, sir, you've got a little bit right here. Not a problem, not a problem. Maybe. Thank you, I often get confused with Phillip the Terrible. Grog begins to blush, a large blue color on his cheeks. Ain't that the truth. You can call him Percy. You're a tiefling?! Oh that's an icy hand grip, isn't it. I am Grog, the unintimidated. (whispered) I think she knows. (whispers) She's a tiefling! Could I ask you what your weapon of choice is? Oh, right, yeah. (under his breath) She's the leader? Nope. Veteran. Rah! It's still good. Hey, get your own papaya. We start to wrestle. Gently. That's my papaya you-- let go! Cats. I have some dried food rations. Would you want one of those? I will remember this slight. That's right! What is your weapon of choice, Lyra? (muffled) Yeah, me too. Twigs work great. Don't they? I like twigs. Yeah, can we kill something now please, before we learn anything else. I mean, we don't have a body bag for some of these chumps. Roll for it. Vanessa, I have a question. What happens if we don't come back with all of the members we left with? Oh, good. Yeah, Ashley killed her. I mean, Pike. Yeah, no problem. What do we have to bring back? Does it say where this dragon lives? It also sparkles. Sparkles in the sunlight. Oh god, here we go again. Can I try to grow my beard, real quick? 33. I'm a damn pirate now. Watch out. (laughs) Jesus... Oh. Wow. There's a story there. 15. Dragon! Drag--! Let's go there. Please, god. Six. I walk over to Dagon-- What? Oh god, here we go. 11. Oh God. Two days on horseback, or two days walking? I have a question. I'm not good with numbers, but it's a two days' journey there? And a two days' journey back? Is that four, and we have three days to do this in? I mean, I'm not the brightest in the bunch, but. Thank God. Really? Done! Shut down! Oh God. Do you have any Clydesdales or giant horses for me? That's what people say about me. That's fine. Yeah! Make him earn it! Oh, puns yeah. The party is. Vex. Thanks, Lyra Oh, I hope it's me. Bob? Peter? He's looking for stuff, right? He's-- Go? Yeah. I haven't finished my training montage yet. Got to run through the snow, got to do pullups on trees. Inverted sit-ups-- (sings) Montage! I have a firewood bundle that we can make a fire with. And I have an axe. Let's do that instead. Can I find a really tiny tree and start hacking away at it? Yeah, tiny. We don't need to kill, like, Grandpa Tree. We kill Baby Tree. Don't-- how about don't tell Keyleth? 16. Hey, Zahra? Impressed? No, I'm probably getting so close. (laughter) I warmed it up first. Yeah. You're welcome. Third watch. You just sleep. You need your beauty rest. Oh, man. No, no, yeah. Shit. I mean, (snores) It's wood. I do. What? Mom? (screams and flails) Sorry. All right, keep sleeping! (whispers) I mean, keep sleeping. You're safe while I'm out. Shit. Me? I see everything. Yes! Minus... 16. I go to check it out by myself. I have low-- Wait, the Dwarven Belt of Beard Power gives me-- I have Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. (chuckles) I yell out, PLAYTIME! Yar. You take a d20. And roll it. Look at that. Add initiative, which is... Shit. Better. Holy crap. We'll be dead. We'll be dead before we leave. 16. Yeah? Eh? You look like someone I just saw recently. I would like to Rage, and I will charge the dire wolf puppy-thing and swing at its head with my great-axe. 26. Ah! 25. That was really good. Thank you. Ten and 18, is 28. Yeah. (laughs) Oh my Grog. (laughs) Where does this come from? (laughs) Lucky bastard. Yes, so 11? Misses. Get him Percy! Do it, Percy! Damn! One turn! What the fuck?! You were sleeping. Are you doing all this naked, since you were woken up so quickly? I applaud. What the what? Yeah, right? With the doves-- I'm up. I would like to go into a Frenzied Rage now that I've got all my playmates around me. And I would like to take one giant swing in a half circle, trying to get all three at one time. So that's a 22. That's a 23. 26. 25! 15. 12. And 17. Ooh. Hits. Misses. Great. The visualization was worth it alone. Yes! What? Oh yeah, you want to cuddle with that? 12. Holy crap what are you? Whoa! You did really well. She can stay. You can spread them out over several games. You don't have to-- Leave none alive, my boy. For the gentleman that I'm facing right now, I would like to take my first swing. Well all right, 24. And that is 19 points of damage. I'll take my second swing at him. Same guy. 26. (laughs) Also 19 points of damage. With my third attack, I'd like to turn to his friend, grab him by the throat and go-- It's death, or target practice for my friends. Talk. Yay. 19. Yeah, 'may'. 20. Nine. Okay. Bless you. Almost. Constipated? Let me kill him. Well, now you're on empty, I take my greataxe and I chop off his head. What. Sorry, Lyra. I go over and I pick up the orc's head and I walk it over to Lyra and I go, here, I'm sorry, you can keep this. It won't happen without me asking again. No, really, look, it's still got stuff in it. Just the tongue? I rip the tongue out of the head. I put the orc tongue in the bag of holding. And the orc head. Both. The lip is in my belt, baby. Should we keep sleeping, or should we just pack it up now and go? Would you say a new day has passed? So can I try for my beard again? Shit. Is it-- is it still my watch? Thanks. (snores) Yeah! Come on, you big bearded bastard! 58. Dire wolf blood all over my feet didn't stimulate the growth at all? All right. Oh shit, we forgot about those. You have just got all sorts of shit. Being fully asleep, I cast fart. (laughter) Should we sleep? Oh, it is? Oh. We ride. And I take the Dust of Tracelessness and I, in the back. No, it's an infinite supply. Yeah, it is, it's really nice. Could I give it-- could I give it a health potion? I can't ride the carpet. We gave the carpet to them. Yeah. That is. Second day. Oh my god. Can we make an agreement. I kill you, you kill me? Aren't I good like above 20,000 feet in really, really cold environments? Is this a constitution saving throw or just a modifier? Oh, wow. 23. (laughs) I've got my chest out, my nipples aren't even getting hard. It's amazing. Your instinct-- that was a low blow. That was a low blow. That was bullshit, Percy. Intercourse. Belly button. Eight. All right. I was like, really? You're the team leader. Right, okay. We start riding. I'm still in the back doing the dust of uhhh. Nay-nay. Learning. Stealth is 14. This is very much like home for me. So I'm proficient here, right? Shit. Which is zero. (laughs) 15. So we got to make it come to us. Jump off? I do. We're screwed! Two giants! Brilliant. Yeah. You guys are rad. Wow. Wow. Bye Vex! Get out of my seat! It is my favorite thing. It's my little baby. I love it. Grog's ale, keep away from giants. They chose that shit? We love you guys. It's not like we want to live or anything. Dicks. Why can't they pick like, you know-- I don't know, goblins or like really angry dogs? Oh, I'm thinking of that. That instant death-ray. Throw it at her! I got dwarvish dice to distribute, too. These were from Eric, redzanwatt, "Grog, thank you to all Critical Role for the joy you "bring me and showing me the amazing world of D&D. These dice would fit in nice with the dwarf beard "I hope you finally grow. Your fan, Eric." Very cool, Eric. Thank you, man. Can I show this off real quick? So I'm a crazy Dallas Cowboys fan and somebody sent me an autographed picture of the original three, like, Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin and Emmitt Smith. It's instantly going on my wall next to my Dallas Cowboys-- Thank you. Thank you thank you, I don't know, the Cowboys are my team. It just came from Nostalgic, I don't even know! Who sent it? It gave me this! Internet? That is amazing. Thank you, guys. With Aldor running away. Click, no. Click, no. Click, no. Joe, a.k.a. jpcguy89, thank you for the dice as well. I found his thing. Happy birthday! What? Oh. Fancy secret agent. Two giants and a dragon, really? They'll be back next week.
