She's throwing them in the acid pits. I think it's acid. Yeah, that's a solid plan. Well if they're fighting, wouldn't it mean it's not over? Maybe we'll see Ripley on the way out. You don't know. He's your friend. You're not mad at all. You want to hop on my shoulders? You're not going to get that, are you? He threw it! You threw it, though, right? You fucking genius! Aw, come on! Front door. Can I pick up my caltrops? Well, they're good guys. Wow! 19 minus... Yes? See, the last time I asked for a young boy people gave me shit, too. Yep. You can't say it in a right way. It's impossible. Innocent request. That's fucked up. Yeah! Vox Machina! (laughs) No, that sounds fair. I've known to preside over many legal matters in my time as Judgeface of Northwind. It would just baffle all of you. It's all right. Oh, why of course, Sub-judge Scanlan. Yes. Even better. What? What kind of weapons did these two have on them? Okay. I reach over and I take out my greataxe and I aim it for her neck. Yeah, swing for the neck. Beheading-style. Natural 20. (laughter) Yeah, like a cane. I look at the axe and look at the blood covering it and I look over at Duke Gonad and I say, so, where are you from and how did you come to be in the service of the Briarwoods? Do I know where that is? Right, the holy lands of the sacred-- all right. Yes, thank you for-- I am quite tired. Would you like to take it from here? Macerate? That's a big word. I'm doing my best to empty the cask of ale into the town patrons and myself. Set up a satellite chain? I walk up behind Vax and I pants him. And I grab the back of his collar and pull backwards. I grabbed your pants and I pulled them down to your ankles. I grabbed the back of your neck and pulled you backwards with your pants around your ankles. 20, plus-- No, 19 plus-- 26. My athletics is plus seven. Damn it. That's all right. It could've been now. It'll just be worse later. Oh, please. That was but appetizers for the main course, my friend. Facepalm. How am I going to beat your acrobatics?
