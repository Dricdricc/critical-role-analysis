Barely. (chuckles) The chatroom. Take it easy on us, all right? I'm ready. Who we fighting next? He's back, he's back. It's not. Very considerate of you, a gentleman's offer. What permission? Even I feel dumber right now. (all laugh) 4...3 and a half. Do it for the Star Wars trailer. Awesome. Great. Should we be stealthing? 17. There’s a trapdoor. And I'm doing my flower girl routine with the dust of tracelessness. Just over here, over there, put a little on Pike. What? We've got a really large amount. Yeah, keep creeping, keep creeping. (growling sounds) Me and Trinket are telling jokes in the back of the group. Yeah, I saw that look. You calling me load bearing? (all laugh) That's honest. Prepare for a natural... lap. 9. Well, we could just get this party started right here, if we want to. Good thing I was clearing our footprints. (all laugh) (high-pitched voice) Is it? Did I do something good? The bullet, the bullet. Bulette. It's a French dog. Of all the things. Don't fuck it up. Did you? I don't know. I'm pretty sure whatever it is, it's dead. Yeah. Like a Wookiee. Or set a trap. I take out the cask of ale and pour a little tankard of ale, just because I'm bored. Would anyone else like a sip? Keyleth? It's good shit, right? Oh! Thanks for the hand! (all laugh) Don't negative anything. It was a good joke. (all laugh) Have mercy! It's all right, Scanlan. We'll go pay for it later. (all laugh) Disadvantage on whatever roll. 26. At least do the hold. A statue? We've got basilisk eggs. Yeah, we’ve got eight of them. Maybe we should crack one on statue guy. Well, what did you see? Me too. (all laugh) Just go ahead and dunk on everybody, why don't you? So, look them in the eye? Got it. (all laugh) Let's go. Yeah! We don't have any more of that. Dragon blood for fucking days. Yeah, let's go towards the door. Yeah, we're all stealthed. Yeah! Do it! Why don't you let the little people have some fun? Do that. Yep, pressure's on! It's been over an hour, we've killed nothing, we'll kill these fucks! I'm a vampire. I need blood. Yep. I approve of this plan. What do you say? But what do you say to get the magic carpet? Ooh, good question. There's three? There's three, not two? There's three up there? I’m just saying, I have been known to climb a few things in my time, if you need an extra. Do you have any climbing gear or anything? Just those two. Scanlan and Pike. You're climbing that shit, aren't you? Cliffhanger. Beautiful. You’ve got a morningstar. Morningstar to the taint. Yeah, oh yeah! I like this plan. (singing) I think we’re alone now! ASHLEY & I rage! (all laugh) (eager laugh) (roars) 19. Nice. And 19 again! 17 and 19. I tilt him towards the pillar to spray the pillar with his gore. Look, I can make one too! Ha ha! (all laugh) (grunts) Hunh! That’s some dark shit! That’s some dark shit! That was awesome! I never knew you were an artist. Cast that shit. No, he's doing an arcana check. Sounds like we need a strong person. Yeah, me and Pike are on this. Give it a good heave-ho. Oh yeah, 23. That's awesome. Poisoning the wall effectively. It was going to be pretty cool. Roll high. Roll really high. What in the hot and holy shit is happening right now? Come on, buddy. Come on, Percy. Thank you! Oh no, we can't see anything. Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! ...also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this... well this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. (weapon crack) Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. (brawling sounds) Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! ...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house, where you pay for... lady favors. Also ale! We're voice actors. We're all trapped in that room together, right? I fart. (all laugh) I'm closer to you now than I've ever been before. Why don’t we just go left? Do you want an extra hand? Will you fucking do something, please? No, you're down there. I follow Pike down there. 20. I should have picked you up. Just a thought, shouldn't we clear this mess before we let prisoners out? I go stand right next to the stairway. MARISHA & I thought you were good at this shit. Is a base attack a straight line from him to Vax to-- Can I, in my rage, bullrush through this? 14. (laughs excitedly) It's Christmas! (laughing) I encourage violence! Minxy! Minxy says I'm sorry! Was it a child duergar? Oh, go ahead, do something else. You hear a little dwarf in the corner go "Mommy?" (eager snarling) (eager snarling continues) You said the room was full of shiny pointy things on the wall, right? I would like to bull rush the dwarf up and against the wall, try and spear him with all the sharp shit on the wall. 24. No, perfect. Tell me I get another attack. Excellent! Perfect! With my second attack as he's screaming out I reach inside, grab his lower jaw and pull him straight down. (laughing) 24. With a 12? Excellent! (laughing) 15. (laughing) Yes! We made cheese of him. Is it chains or rope? Is it chains or rope? Wait, wait. Find out who she is first. If she's under the Imperius Curse. Yeah, I got it. I got it! (snarling) That's hot. Could I offer to you this black, studded leather, dwarven armor? It's not leather, actually. It's the black, dwarven armor-- It's in the bag. (quietly) Grog likes scars. You can have mine. That was amazing. (all laugh) Could I, um, would you like to touch my axe? (all laugh) Oh, uh. (clears throat, sniffs) Maybe we should get out of here. (all laugh) Oh, shit. I get right up behind them too, competing for space. In the meantime, I have a greatsword or a morningstar mace that you can have until we find your items. Greatsword it is. As I see her grab the sword, I ask, “Would you care for some ale?” (all laugh) Absolutely. Plenty of time! (all laugh) I'm right with Minxy, competing for first place. Perfection! (laughs) Uh, what was that word? Do it. I will help you do that if he missteps. Allies, allies. I thought we were going to have to pick. We got like ten more minutes! Wait, show of hands, if we have to pick between one or the other, who's picking Kima? Who's picking turtle-face? We're going to throw down, this is gonna be Marvel versus DC in this bitch. Yeah! Yeah! (all laugh) Did you see her work in that room of blood? Yeah! Yeah. Is valid.
