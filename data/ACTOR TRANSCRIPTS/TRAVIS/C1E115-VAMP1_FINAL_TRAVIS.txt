Yeah! Backblaze rap! Just your jewelry floating around in the empty space. I did. The troublesome twosome. Pretty sweet. The comic book is amazing. Beardless Grog. He's like a baby! A baby in the woods. The writing is fucking brilliant, as always, Colville is amazing. Olivia Samson. There's also going to be a Talks Machina next week on Tuesday discussing this one shot. Yes, there will be. Me too. Three successes. Do you like radishes? Can I reach my fingers through the crack in the top of the coffin and see if there's any light, cold, or anything? No light? Gross. I like this! She eats her hand. Oh shit! So much crying since last week! Oh no. I'm going to try and reach using my superior strength and try and punch through that crack into the wood above. That's three successes and one failure with the red. (groans) I made it out first? Do I see anything? (shushing) Guys! I'm outside the boxes! The fuck? Sam! Quit yelling like a little bitch! Can I find my way to-- Is that Liam? Okay, sit tight. Can I find my way to Laura's sound? You guys are fucked. Can I try and smash through the floor? Strength brawl? You are so kind! Give me one more of these things. Damn. There are. There are five successes and two failures. None on red. Oh! Shit! You did what?! You ate a rat? It wasn't because I punched through the floor? You could have lied and I wouldn't have known that! Ugh, god! Is there any left? Quick note we could get out of here and leave everybody else. Let's get everyone else out. I'll go get Liam and Sam, you get Matt and Marisha. On your X I rolled five successes and two failures, but none on the red. You okay? You all right? It looks a little fucked up. We could leave right now. Don't worry about it. You know what? It's the lighting in here; it's super low. Let's get everybody else out first. Sam? Scream like a baby some more. Okay, cool. Can we find our way over to the baby screams? Liam, you want to help me? Is anybody wearing a watch? Let's get Sam out first. Strength and brawl is what he told me last time. I have one red fail, and one, two, three, four successes. In the coffin? Or just on the floor? Nope. I'm going to go look for the sound of that rat. I feel like I need a rat. Amazing. Like, maple syrup and chocolate syrup? What are you doing? Oh, sorry. Can I keep looking for that rat? Damn it. Three of three, including one crit. Okay. Auspex, heightened awareness. I go right after it. I'm going to give it a good little (snarls). Where'd Laura go? I feel funny. I'm really hungry. Yeah, it was like breakfast pizza and gyros? I don't. What's the matter with you, you love Lucky Charms! Are they old? One. SAM and Who did she deliver tea to? Who did you give the tea to? Can I make my way out of the bullpen, back towards the server room? Can I approach the server room window? Can I look inside? Oh god. Three successes. Do I smell anything? Okay. I don't see Sean anywhere? Yeah, I know! There's no writing or sign on the door that says, "Drive-Thru"? Try the tea. He's literally a pile of ash? Clothes, anything, just ash? (shouting) Pick up the ashes! She's not out here! No, I'm not crying, I'm freaking the fuck out! No! Yes! No! I'm out there with you, I'm by the server. Do we bring the ashes with us or do we like put them in a trash bin? We don't tell Marisha! She'll freak out. Maybe there's a way to undo it. Did you eat a rat a second ago? What'd you do? What do you mean? Oh fuck! What happened? We took care of the guy we were with. What'd you do? Does he smell good? Okay. Not sure what's happening? Sun bad. Sun very bad. Can I look at Dani? Dani, why are you wearing a sign that says "Drink me"? Not wearing a sign. Chris is. Why are you wearing a sign that says "Drink me?" Father said you had to? We should kill Chris. Nope. This Chris. Chris, do you want me to kill you? We shouldn't kill Chris. The wedding's done, Liam! We got to get Liam out of there! I kick Eric dead in the chest just for good measure. He was coming after Liam! Just strength? Six successes, no failures. (coughing) I back out. My shoe changed. I kicked him in the chest and my shoe changed. I got out of it, though! His chest gives you new shoes! Is she still sitting down? Dani, show me your hands! Yeah, I kicked Eric's chest out and he started laughing. Unpowered laptop. Just black screen? She's typing furiously? Hey. Should we bring one of these "Drink Me" guys with us? I don't know. Like a decoy. No offense, Chris. Chris, do you want to come with us? You don't know that. We're all a bit of our characters. He burns. Bursts into flame. (yelling) Oh god, he rolled something. (singing) It's a good vibration! Which teeth began to grow? The buck teeth or the canines? We should go to the Twitch set. Fine, we'll leave him. What the fuck? I'll actually use my heightened senses. I see hunger roll is perception plus investigation. Liam's whispering and Sam's talking in a normal voice. They're saying if things go pear-shaped, they're going to fuck us and take care of each other. We've been to the front door, we've been to the bullpen, we've been to the server room. And there's that area beyond the Twitch stage that I never go into. You all died so fast! Yeah! Cloaked_roamer! Can we make our way back to the Twitch stage? (laughs) Oh no. It's all upstairs. Some people know this, actually. Definitely the safest way back to the Twitch stage is through the Nerdist office. Sam, you should lead us. Just right through this long passageway. Can I do the same? Oh, three successes. Take a red die. Three successes. You got distracted, you're left behind. So what's the versus mean? So this is the intelligence one. And that's two successes and the willpower is two successes. And a failure, but not a red. It's four successes. Hey man. You are actually the person I'm most concerned about, so you stay close to me. I'll keep you safe. Look what I found! Through the Nerdist office? Nothing? Let's go. Let's keep going. To the Twitch stage. Wired. It doesn't really work. None of the laptops worked. You were playing with nothing. Okay, this is obviously some sort of puzzle, right? I would high-five you right now. A heart, a sun, a face, a cross in a circle. In the circle or-- If you're a vampire, yeah. Those are a problem. Test-tube babies? When she stood in the sun, did anything happen? Why don't you take the stake that we were given and stab the heart with it? Okay. So heart and stake. Not cohesive. That's true. Should we check the little prop closet? Can we turn the light on? I hit the switch. I do have heightened senses. Do I smell anything coming from this room? Nothing tasty or spicy or interesting? I mean, spicy is the wrong word. It's always spicy in there. Does it smell delicious? You guys are okay here looking for rats, right? I'm going to go with Liam. Chris, Arcade. I'm standing behind Liam, holding the prop knife to the rest of the room. Is there anybody moving towards Liam? What are you doing? Are we eating people? What's happening? Is there a little coagulant in Liam's spit, at least? I know they do. So Liam and I make our way out. Are we sharing with the others what just happened? LAURA and We canvassed the offices and found-- Yeah, I found this dagger! It's not super sharp, but-- Yeah. Did you find anything out about the puzzle? Ooh! Wait a minute. Mercer died by the sun, right? Don't we have his ashes in the Power Rangers helmet? I pour the ashes of Mercer onto the sun square. Silver chalice. You have the silver chalice. Holy fuck. Take notes. Plus, Matt Key's head was in the office. I don't see any other clear connections. How about we continue reconning the bottom of this floor? So who's going to take the audio booth? You go in the very back, I'll take the audio booth. Who wants the three bathrooms? What are you going to go? I'm the closest, so I'll go into the recording booth area. Well, it's locked, so-- It's pretty solid with a fire door. Well, let me try it. Can I back up and try to run through the door? So that loads me up pretty good. That's a serious door. Yeah, it's no joke. That is a ton of success. That's five successes and no failures. It really is, yeah. Yeah, right? In the doorway, with my heightened senses, can I see anything in the darkened room? Amy? Josie? Jody. Sorry. Are you guys okay? Yeah. I broke the door. Can I come in the room? Okay. I walk in the room a little bit. I'm still holding a giant sword. I don't? Oh shit. I was like, I know this fucking game! Can I tuck the sword behind my back real quick? It's not for you. So I'm in the little engineering room, right? Is the booth clear? Is there anything in there? You're sure? Do you mind if I look? Stay right where you are. Please. Don't move. Can I walk over to the door and look through and see what's in the booth? Nothing? Not even food or drinks? Laura! Come in here! Oh shit. Can anybody hear me? Yeah, that wasn't that loud. Can I try to open the booth door? Can I peek my head in and look behind the door? Check the corners. Just make sure it's food and drink. Can I use my Aura Perception to see if there is anything else in the room? It says hunger roll, perception plus empathy minus manipulation plus willpower. No, versus. Manipulation versus plus willpower. Let me get a notion of how Amy is feeling since Jody is just writing. She's on the other side. So I roll three of these, right? Three successes, no failures. Manipulation plus willpower. LIAM and Amy. I'm going to ask you to move back into the booth until we can make sure it's more safe. Can you tell me what you've seen and what you were hiding from? We've seen the vacant eyes and mouths as well. We put down two ourselves. They laughed afterwards. That's really disturbing. Okay. I can't promise that it's safe outside of this room and I'm sorry I broke the door. Will you just wait inside the booth? That's my normal knock, but okay, that sounds fair enough. Can I make a look around the room before I leave for anything that might be used as a weapon? It's pretty bare, right? I'll pick up the door, back out of the room and pull it back there with the handle. Yeah. That's a great question. Ivan, Amy, Damion-- What? From where? Yep. Should've taken your head out of your ass, let's go! Quit blaming other people for your weakness. Cleanly? Does blood explode? Fragments? Amy fragments? Are you marking it off? I really do. Yeah! (laughs) Yes! Oh shit! How loud? That's-- I mean, you're way back there. I do have Heightened Senses! Can I hear her? I mean, if you want to be a big girl about it. (laughs) This has been going on for a while. I'll say I pulled from the middle before and it was the Void. Ooh. Like a surgeon. I've made my way back to the back at this point. Hey. Hey, Ivan. That's fun. I gather. You did? Yeah! How bad could it be? You know what, Ivan, I'm a fan of card games. I am. I haven't. I'm a fan of card games. I hate to rush into anything too hastily. Yeah, you don't look so great. Maybe we'll check out the rest of this floor real fast and then I'll come back. Do you need us to send in Chris or Arcade? Fair enough. Sam? Yeah. Laura. Why don't you stand up and come with me and we'll come back. Is that right? Ivan's here and has electrical powers. How many chairs are there? Of the three of us, only two others can play. You draw a card. She drew a card and learned something. I don't know. Given my general feeling of our environment, I think almost all this shit's fucked up. Just a fair bit of sprinkling of that, just about everywhere I look. Yeah, I think so. That's a good idea? Actually, Sam, why don't you go snag--? Max? Max is back in the office. He's wearing a Drink Me sign. Why don't you go snag Max? Oh, two of them? Max, sit down at the table. Now, before we leave, I would like to see a card drawn. Yeah, Max, pull a card. What's upstairs, Max? Beast-like? Max, the last thing we remember is leaving after the last game. How long have you been here? When I look at Ivan, does he look disappointed or pleased with the outcome of this card pull? All right, Max, come with us. I thought that might be happening. Yeah. I'll tell you what, Max, sit tight. We'll be back for you. Ivan, we'll try and find you another player. I mean, he has a good point. Tell him to pick another card. You're right. You're right, Sam. I mean, you had the inspiration. One of us should pick a card. It's you. Yeah, as long as Max is at the table. How does Max look? You're fast as shit. Can I run over to Max and check his pulse with my fingers on his carotid? We were going to get fucking knowledge first! We were supposed to get knowledge! Max died for nothing! He was already up out of the chair. You do. I like the impulse to violence. Is he bleeding profusely? You know what they say about shit that doesn't bleed. Ivan, my wife is very careful about these things. You try to screw over your-- Ivan are you like us? Can I go over to Max's corpse and pat down his pockets to see if he's carrying anything cool? Damn it, Max. So aside from upstairs, we know pretty much everything. I make my way out of that room. Occult? Two successes. What you needed. I'll take the cage and open it up. There's a steak in there? Is it a real steak or a rubber steak? I was going, "meat steak?" I will take that stake, and I will also take-- Wait, can I take my shirt off-- TALIESIN, LIAM, and And can I throw the shirt over the cross to try and pick it up? Yeah. When my shirt is off, does my skin sparkle at all? Oh god. You look handsomer. Does she gain an additional blood die, or anything? What did you find? Babe, what did you find? But what did you find up there? You found a book? What does it say? Or we could try and solve this puzzle. Sam and I will make our way out to the puzzle. Laura, where are you going? Upstairs is dangerous. In case it's dangerous, why don't we try and solve the puzzle first? See what happens. I'll take the cross covered with my t-shirt, and without touching it, dump it on the lower right-hand corner of the circle. Don't you need that to eat more disgusting rats with? The whole time. No, have you? Try the book? Okay, fair enough. I also have a fair amount of hunger, so between Chris, Audrey, and Arcade should we call dibs? They have a sign around their neck that says "drink me." It says "drink me." How about Laura checks out the scuttling? Well, I just want to make sure that we're safe. So much. Undying love. Yeah. Give it a look. I'll be right behind you. Is this Warcraft sword made of silver, or anything? That was the fart, Liam. Are we calling that a performance? Small talk, and then business. Do we hear a commotion? Can we hear any commotion? Don't look at us. Follow your heart. (laughing) For your strangulation? From the where? Other end? The front of the building? Bipedal? Wait. Let's try and communicate! Three successes and two fails, one of which is red. Another wits? Just wits? They're all red. That's a success, a ten, and a one. The wolf with the tattoos and the other one with the shaved sides? I don't know how to burn will, but I'll do whatever. I'll add athletics. Come on, athletics. Five successes and one red failure. What are you talking about? That's so funny, he kind of said something similar to me! Can I use my Aura Perception to understand what Liam is doing? It says "interplay of colors in an aura provides insight into the subject's emotions." Okay, you have to roll manipulation plus willpower versus my perception plus empathy. Four successes. It means insight into his emotions, motives, and nature. I'd like to know why he's asking everyone to protect him. You're asking my wife to look out for you if it comes down to it? What about me? Right. Yeah. Makes sense. Where are we? Can we take a look around? I'll use my heightened senses to-- Fucking don't jump out and scare me. I will attack whoever comes out here. If you jump out on me, it's not going to go well for that person. Which way did you go? To the left? Oh, you went to the right? Oh, we recognize a few of the corpses? I'll make my way toward the command center where all the computers and tricasters. Yeah, I was entranced. I keep going up more. The person that I can't see. Hello? Excuse me, we just made our-- Do we recognize his face? That is two successes. Of three dice. I just rolled academics, nothing else. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Are you responsible for the puzzle lock on the door? My name is Travis-- Pleasure. And you are? The Gary Gygax? Thanks, Liam! We found ourselves in a bit of a situation. Do you happen to know what's going on around here? Is there anyone else in this studio at the moment? Outside? Forgive me, this is all very new to me, but isn't the sun up outside? Right. Sam? Liam? Laura? Mr. Gygax, I'm not really sure what comes next. Can you tell us a little bit about what we have to look forward to? He turned to ash in the sun. Yeah, unfortunately-- Matthew Mercer opened a curtain near the front of the building and was struck by a ray of sunlight. Is that not reversible? It's not just Matt. I think it's past that a little. Marisha turned to mushroom. There was tea, apparently, and she had some. Was he calling us--? Dunked on by Gary Gygax! Posterized! The burn is real! Sunbeam! What happens in 60 seconds? We would love to sign whatever it is. We're very particular about the metallic colors. It's right over by the computers. Now, Mr. Gygax, there's really no need to grow shit out of your hands. I merely want to sign whatever-- What do you have for me to sign? I think that will be fine. I grab the Vecna statue. You don't happen to have a pen on you, do you? Where?! No, he said there was a studio downstairs! We run down the tunnel! Gary does, or Matt does? I take the Vecna statue and I go, ah! I have not killed any humans yet. What? That's five. You were great! That's right. If you haven't tried it, give it a try.
