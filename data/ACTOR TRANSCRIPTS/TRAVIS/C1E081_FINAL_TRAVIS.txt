Start crying before the show starts. Oh, yeah, look at it. Do we get them for free, do we get them? Those are awesome. - Yeah, trying to get it to you sooner. He's a dick! Say-- say something? We're not-- (screaming) ♪ (electricity crackling) ♪ Gross. Using my magic, can I detect which direction the beast fled? - Okay. I don't know anything. Yep. -(Same) Yeah. Don't die. - Yeah, now we're all going on up towards the hole. - Oh! I didn't break it. - Yes, come on over. Yeah, much war still happening. - Is Kash there? How's he look? - You look a little worse for the wear there. Oh, I'm sorry. Z, did he go unconscious? Are you lying? - Shit. - Good job, I guess, Kash. No, that would never hurt me. "Gently enough." Yes, good throwback! Good callback. Damn it. Pike cures all. Six total? Oh, please let it be-- (talking over each other) Free basing, so! (talking over each other) Oh, there was no one even in here! Anyone check to see if the pipe's still packed? What did J'Mon do to him? (laughter) Darkness. I'll take that. Yep. - Are you tired? You were asleep when we found you. Holy shit. - Was it like poison gas or like lava or did a rock fall on your head? Actually, you-- you did get killed. Yeah, we shit the bed on that. It was a complete failure. - Yep. Don't know, folk tale. While you're pulling that up, is there anything shiny in the cave that I can walk towards? Cause I'm bored. All this like lava and gold, there's got to be gold, right? Platinum. Yeah, like cheese, if we're lucky. What? You don't dream of cheese in your treasure? Oh! What-- I cannot keep up. Yeah. - I thought she teleported. Where am I going? Good answer. - Flash. Which is probably rigged to explode. Raise your hand if you have less than 30 hit points. As they discuss, can I just walk over to a pile of-- Of course. Super worried. Oh, you skinned your knees, let me blow on that. (cross talk) So there is a full blown war happening up on-- Gold. - There's a lot of talking happening, I just wandered off. Okay, gonna be high. Oh, 17 plus, minus 2. -Fifteen. - I feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff. Are there any, like, unique looking knick-knacks or really lovely or dangerous looking weapons that grab my eye? Because it's just a lot of shit. I love it when he reaches for stuff. What? Yeah. - Oh, no, no, it's not the same thing. This is different, this is a movable rod. If there's a vase I would totally smash that. Okay, that's boring. The box, like does it look like it's simple to open? What would-- - What would that guy that's always sneaking around do? Intelligence check two minus--yeah two, okay. -So, zero. - Even with the titanstone knuckles, it doesn't open? Yeah. - Dammit. Eleven. That was a low roll. I'll go get it. - Yeah, yeah, open the sleeve, the leather sleeve. Little cards. - Do they smell like anything? How far away is the lava? Who the hell uses-- - What? - I'm going through the loot, you all are fucking healing and shit, I'm trying to find something useful here. Pretty much. - What, I'm trying to find something. There's a giant rolled up carpet over here. Yeah, I mean some people call it a telafaphy or whatever. Uh, I don't know, it looks like a bunch of cards. No, they're mine, I found them. You have all of this stuff to choose from, have at it. No. - There's really no way around this, I've got to pull a card out of the leather sleeve, right? Yeah, I'll pull one card out, but I want to pull the one in the middle because I remember magicians be like, choose a card, any card. I mean, on any day, but you're lucky I'm really in control. What is that, I don't even know what that is. What is this? Is it fair to say that everyone knows what this is but me? Sam doesn't know. Scanlan doesn't know what this is. Do you know what this is? Laura, do you know? Patrick, do you know what this is? I'm feeling amazing and great right now. Oh really, just straight up? That's unfortunate. (cross talk) It's called an enchanted deck? Is there a name for it, whatever this is? - What's the name? I genuinely am only doing this because I don't know what the hell it is. Would that have activated all of them and then...? Oh, they're magical... Not ready for... - 'Cause you know what it is. Well, there's like 13 cards, how bad can it be? What's the percentage of bad cards to good cards? It's mostly bad? How many pulls do I get? Why would you give me that?! (laughing) You give me like chastity belts or-- That's good, stars are nice. Orion wouldn't fuck us. Oooh! Whoa. Does it make any noise when I swing it? I'm apparently the most powerful sorcerer that has ever lived. I have to hit something with it. Is there like a tall statue around or anything? A marble bust is good, that's perfect. Can I pick it up? Lob it-- It just broke because you distracted me. (laughing) I've got to go find another bust. Is there another? Thank God there's another. They wrote on stuff, right? - Okay, then nobody cares what they looked like, cool. Take it and lob it in the air, big swing. - Okay. Can I make this a reckless attack? Twenty seven. Okay. I'm kind of doing it off of the blood axe, so like 16? No necrotic no-- Just 16. - It is really well balanced, that is, and I just hold it up to my ear. (laughing) We're good. - We're totally good. It is, yeah. And I stealthily try and pocket the other cards. But I haven't showered in a few days and my bum itches. Shit, that's a natural 1! (laughing) God damn it! They only activate under my magical touch. May, may I--I actually, I found that. But I don't, I want to hold on to it, it's mine. You can keep all the other gold. Why not? Look what I made. Yeah, I'm sure it's like reactive its user-- And then you can have it. I go to look for another Deck of Many Things and nothing else. (laughing) Garbage. Rubbish, filth. (laughing) Life has no luster to it anymore. You wretched... I didn't roll any 'cause I was looking through this Deck of Many Things! 90. It's a flying telefaphy. Wwwaahhhhhhh. Eight hundred. Like three hundred. Yeah flying speed of 30, I can run faster than that. Blaaaaah, yeah. Ooh, that's a diss on your boots, dog. Vex, you're drooling. I feel like this is too much for anyone-- Yeah, but how do we do that? - Should we reward Kerr? Kerr, do you want some of this bling? What about like big diamonds or rubies for like important spells and stuff? I pass out from the smartness. (laughing) The guilt of it. (laughing) I'm taking 184 gold pieces. Like candy or something. Jellybeans in a jar. No, really? Sure would be a gesture in the right direction, though. How about we don't give them anything and we just let them know it's clear to come down here and deal with it as they will. So what is it, we hand deliver it or we just let them know it's clear to come down? I agree, it's more personal. You write the limerick and we give them two platinum. (laughing) What was the number you said? It just turns into swords-- So, what, five thousand platinum? We could give them like three pizza platinum, it doesn't really matter to me, I just want to go. - Yeah. I took out a card of this little pouch and it turned into this thing. Yeah, it was like a little card in like a leather pouch and then Vex took it from me 'cause apparently I make too many weapons. Honestly, are we gonna stay around and really regulate what happens here, we're not, right? We've got shit to do. I'm with Percy. Over yonder. I'm running for office. Yeah, don't we need to like get a hand and plant it under a tree or something like that? How about we go to Whitestone and then scry? Yeah. - Aye. - Whitestone. -Sorry, are we not saying it? - I thought Asum came down to the Ziggurat. - I believe it's archipela-jo. Well done, man. You don't know shit. -You know less than me. - I've got a new weapon down in the, in the lair. Can you identify this? - Just take a look at it. It's really pretty. I throw it on the ground. I threw it on the ground. I throw it on the ground! I don't need your dancing! Duh! (laughing) Yeah. - It's gonna kill me. - Clang-a-lang-a-lang. - I feel moved by Scanlan's tunes, and I go over and I pick up the sword and... (singing gibberish) Perverts. Yeah, but it's very sharp. Oh right, shitter, compliments, take it to dinner. For it or for me? - Okay. Really? - What? She forgets herself sometimes, it's all right. Thank you, Gilmore. Your word is safe with us because I don't know what you're talking about. Don't tell him. Not long. - The old hangout! - That is not true, that finger of yours is very powerful. That's true. Brilliant. We wish you well, Gilmore. No, you gotta stay. I'm just kidding, you can come. (laughing) Heyo, heyo, Ker, heyo. Is Samantha attractive? Awesome, hey, Ker, Ker. - Put in a good word. Hey. ♪ What is that? - Make for Greyskull Keep-- - Why the hell did we walk? What's that? - I thought they said that was the wastelands. Isn't that where they bury all the shit? - Yup. (laughing) ♪ Me too, it was my idea. Four. (laughing) - It's just us, yeah. It's just us this time, I know we usually have a lot in tow-- Paintbrush of gore. I love him so much. Holy shit, you're turning into a drug lord. He is Heisenberg. - Outstanding. - Meat man coming. - Amazing! Amazing! I'm working on something here, cut to the chase. Amazing. Yeah, if Ker is with the liquor and not being quiet, -I'm probably with him. - We're not worried about the spinning dirt button of death, right? It's fine down there, like it's-- We may find more about Opash in Wildmount. Is she? - What else is on your list? - Where did we leave them? Hotis, oh, yeah. - I took a couple pictures while I was in that... (whistling and laughing) Don't you put that evil on us. Don't even put it out there. Yeah, it's something. Probe. - Probe. Would you? - Yes! - Oh, it's really good! - ...sand dunes of terribleness. - I pop the top, and I hand the bottle to him. What is it, sand keg, sand... - Yeah, that stuff. (cross talk) It has really got -some balls on it. - Just, like, ... - It's all clear. Agreed. That is good shit. Really impressive. No, no, no, yeah, you gotta warm up -and then take another one. - We didn't mean to be rude. Do you want some? Do it. - Don't listen to him. We're trustworthy. Open the bottle. -Down the hatch. - That's what I'm saying! - Will you teach me your sorcerous ways? How do you feel? I don't--I don't know what to say. - Were you in a motorcycle gang? How did she do that? - Creepy. - I've got two healing potions. Oh? Amazing. Let's do it, let's sleep. Ooh, how does that feel? Strangely, I agree with Percy. No. - Let's be honest. We're not quite at our best, and it's one diseased deceiver in a cave with another dead dragon that might or might not come back to life, and two baby little eggs. We rest, and then we give 'em hell! Plus she doesn't know that we know where she is. She thinks she's got all the time in the world. No, I wanna wait. Maybe, but we are fucking tits against lairs, come on. Keyleth, are you worried if we wait, you're going to lose the chance to kill Raishan? She thinks she's got cover, but she doesn't. Don't you wanna be at your best? Don't you wanna be some fucking wicked badass from the sky? Or do you wanna limp in? - Yeah. I know it feels like an advantage to press, but we were five down at one point. You can, but it's not advisable. No, I'm not worried about those. In his lair. - Agreed. Keyleth, we know what we're asking of you. We're asking you to wait, again. (chuckling) We plan. It's actually dawn--sorry. Make the call, Keyleth. That stupid dog alarm. - Yeah, Patrick!
