Oh man, I mean, just-- They've all been anointed with our individual musks. Yeah, DNA all over. Nope. You're just hitting him in the face. (laughs) Deuces. (gagging noise) Am I still in there? Can I go over to him? Does he look the same? Can I reach out and put my hand on his chest? Do I feel anything? This is not over. It can't be. (laughs). We've done so much and we have so much more to do, right? This is, this is not over. All right, don't, don't you move. Go ahead and get your shut eye and we'll be back. You rest here. Try not to have too much fun without us. And I leave. Hold on. Look at me. It's so funny. I never realized it before. You look so much like him. I'd expect no less (laughter) (groans) Right. (laughter) I'll go. I step up, and I take my Titanstone Knuckles off. I take the Belt of Dwarvenkind off and I wrap it around the knuckles, and I lay it next to Scanlan, and I say, You've been with me through so much. I pride myself on my strength, but as we fought Earthbreaker Groon, you were there by my side as I learned that my true strength comes from my friends, which means that these trinkets, no matter how strong they are, mean nothing. You knew me before then, and I would hope you would know me after. While my best buddy Pike taught me to love, you taught me to laugh, and I don't want to know what life is like without that. And the last thing I'd say is, you spent so many times inspiring me, I'd like to take a page from your book. And to the tune of the Washington Redskins fight song-- (laughter around the table) I sing (singing) Hail to Scanlan Shorthalt Hail to victory! No one can make me laugh faster. Please bring him back to me. 14. Did you really? Anybody wanna wake him up? Yeah. Do you mind if I carry him? MARISHA and I pick him up. That's better. That's more like it. Yeah, that's appropriate. (all laugh) Everyone, he may have pissed himself. (all laugh) Just remind him later. You know, man, these lootcrates are great. If you haven't got one, you should. Where are we dropping off the urine smelling one? All right. I do that. You know your own kind. (laughing) He wiped a nose on his cheek. (laughs) That's right, it's ours. Shit. Question mark. Oh, shit! Aww, damn it. I'm just staying outside his room. Why, that is true, that could have been much-- what is this? They gave it to you. You didn't-- You didn't pay for it, no coin. You don't know if it's, like, cheap or expensive. Hold on, let an expert take a taste. And I take a sip. (all laugh) Come on, Gil. That's a three... No, that's a one. Yes, this is clearly the finest reserve alcohol of the... area. We shall enjoy this to great lengths. May I commend you on the acquisition of a great-- I think I just stroked out on that word. Here. Yeah, it has, unfortunately. A bit too often. But I have to say, before this group, I didn't even know people could do that, 'cause you know me. I can't do anything like that. Have you ever done one of those? Really? Wait, so are you saying, someone coming back is rare? I don't really know how pra-- pracsti-- they are either, but I guess I hadn't really thought about it much. It just seems like the others in the group are responsible for it. This one was hard, though. I felt like it might not work, you know? Well, yeah. I mean, of the ones I've seen. Uh... for what? To stay warm at night or for a resurrection? (all laugh) No? Oh, okay. Cause that would be-- what would you use? Like, you can't bring along, like, a tea cosy and then be like bam! You're back! How would that even work? What are you talking about? You picked the wrong source. (all laugh) You know, if you have questions, the wall behind me also knows probably as much as I do. (all laugh) I'm good with that. So you, like, you take a big shiny thing, and then someone starts like "ay-ay-ah". Aaah! Oh my god! Shit. Really good point. We might be in trouble, Kerr. Is this why the gods gave us two hands? (all laugh) Serum. Did they teach you that in your Sarenrae temple classes, because if not, maybe you have a thing or two to teach them now. Percy, the gods gave you two hands for bottles for each of them! That's too much. My brain will explode. Probably some intermittent farting. Wait. Prove that you're you. It's you. (all laugh) Is that creepy? Well, okay. (fart noise) Oh, us? Yep. Notes of brack. I was also talking about what a great job you do. Apparently, you're really rare. Like, like, apparently, you and your resurrections, like, they don't always work. Which is amazing. I didn't know that. Perfume de Grog. That's a lot of shit you're wearing, man. What? You don't think your life is your own? Oh. (whispers) I just got it too. Yep, raising drinks. What do we tell him when he wakes up? I have not explored any of that, and it is amazing. That's true. If you're stationary, that's one thing. I walk out of the room. She's a monstah. Those pythons, yo. In a coma. Oh my god. (all laugh) I'm shocked. A man of the world. (laughs) Oh no, he's still asleep. You gave him back problems? Yeah And I suppose we really shouldn't rush Scanlan, I mean, we might be able to do some of those. It is? Pretty much anything is good. Yeaaah, swamp ass! (all laugh) Your brother's not here That's where we saw him last. Maybe you should hit up Eskil for some tricks. Uh, yes. No, no, no. Yes! Yes! Oh shit, she saw the room. You're sure? You'll be all right here? I'm sure Percy can let you have whatever you want, right, Percy? Just anything she wants. Do I need to remind you of the title you gave me? Surely I hold some power in-- It doesn't really matter, I'm just saying, if she needs something while we're gone-- Uh-huh. I have decreed it. That was the proper title. (all laugh) Yeah. Ready. You're leaving? Where are you going? Yeah, plus you got all that money you took from down in the dragon's lair, so that helps. Yeah. His hammer glows. (mournfully) Bye, Sam. Patrick! Did Foster just shart? What was it? Who sneezed? It's like somebody sniped a parakeet. That was crazy. (loud high tooting sound) Is that a sneeze or is he fucking with us? Pantomime it. Yes, I did want to grab them from the temple. No! I got them. We do have a grocery list of things that we could pick from, right? Do we want to make good on that promise real fast, or what? The thing under the tree? Hey, let's hold off on that one, I think. Oh, Greyskull? We're all sore, right? We could knock the dust off a little bit if we just did a little delivery, like some final remains into a tree, or a hand, or whatever. Where is the hand going, again? LAURA AND Why? Who did we promise that to? That's boring. Let's go to Vasselheim. I guess we could do that. Modify Memory. We don't need to check in with The Clasp, do we, or anything? Do we know where everyone else is? Yep. Kima! She's staring at you. In between salsa and chips there. Killer. Yeah. Thanks for kicking ass with us. Whew! Thank goodness. Lie? Well, I have seen you. (silly noise) What easy thing can we accomplish? Cool! To the keep. I think it looks nice. I mean, it's kind of like a lived-in look. Yeah. We do tend to wander. Can I go down to Percy's room? Yeah, the workshop. Is the door closed? (gasps) Fucking sweet. I go in. (all laugh) Are there any of those dangerous buckets of water around? Treacherous. (all laugh) --crates of powder, or-- Oh, that's not terrible! 14. Can I pour a little out? Hm, no fire, dangerous water, no weapons? (all laugh) Shit. All right, I turn around and I leave. Hi! Oh! Yes. Securing the castle. Yeah, no, there was a guy, right? And I like, "Hey you, stop!" and he was covered in this black powder and he just he gave me the slip. Yup. You saw him! Why'd you let him go? I should go after him, then. Oh. I have a moment. Me? Huh. Okay. (all awww) What? I'm holding my breath. LAURA and Hiccups? No fights at all? Like, what if we run into bad people? Don't make him roll-- make him roll for it. (all laugh) No unnecessary fights. Yup. Why would you want to-- do you not like-- Why don't you check it? It's your say, go for it. I don't know, ask him. Do what you want, man. Man, I know what that's like. Yeah, he's not allowed. I might have made that up. (all laugh) You're right, yeah Yeah. Oh wait, that's a good idea. I mean, she is quite holy right? Like, if anyone was gonna look on those sacred remains least it would be old stinker here. I second that. Yeah, like, yo, is this the dead or-- What have you been reading? What's wrong with your face? Oh. Right. We just bury it in the tree, that's it. In the tree. Bada-bing, bada-bam. One little fucking box. Reveal your secrets! Oh no. This seems really out of the way for what is a simple burial. Hey! Yes. Oh my god. Like baby powder. Let's get over there. The wondrous sand doesn't come up? That's awesome. Why is it called the Birth Heart tree? All right, let's go find it. Do we proceed towards it? Can we keep an eye out for guards? Anybody that might be watching us? Me? He who asks rolls a ten. Bidet. Why's your binder closed? What's that? Do we have to make one that looks like that? Okay. (whispering) It's a cafe. (mimics throwing up) Should we ask if maybe she knows her, the name? Yeah, just put the box in there. Question. What sort of thing would represent an unwelcome burial? Oh, right, yeah. Like foreign seeds or something? Agriculture control, very important. Sorry for all the questions. It's very lovely here. Holy shit! Oh, legit! The resurrection was both the Raven Queen and-- This is kind of her spot-- Earth tone? You're-- you're getting a little-- Put the box in the ground. (like Gollum) Why should I? Thank you for, um, this. It's not the Swiss Family Robinson tree house. Wow. Just walk away. Walk away. Oh, shit. Do we get to leave the arboretum now? (everyone laughs) I stepped on this toadstool and I'm afraid to tell someone. (everyone laughs) I can't. I'm scared, they're looking really close. See, that was not such a big deal. All that fuss for a box in the dirt. Ooh, yeah. We haven't been to a right proper store in a long time, right? What's wrong with you? Yeah? (gasps) Say it. Oh, shit. Are you sure you weren't here? Were you not? Oh, that's right. The Crucible is a pit fighting arena next to the temple of Kord, right? Around that area? In the Trial Forge. Yeah. One on one. No weapons. Nope. No, you can have-- It's like a bare-knuckle fight. I mean does anybody-- You got a gift for me? Oh. I mean, I dunno about anybody else, but besides the store, I would like to go by the temple of Kord again. Just pop in. I don't want to bore anybody. Oh, okay. No, yeah, you have. Been keeping track. (everyone laughs) I resent you. Well, I thought you-- all right. The Birth? The Trial Forge? The temple of Kord? Yeah. I mean, I would like to go to the temple of Kord. Pike, do you want to see-- Yeah, the Braving Grounds. She's looking at her schedule. Can we make our way towards the Temple of Kord? Yeah. Do you want to go inside? Only the strong may enter. All right. I would like to go inside. Meh. You can come in if you want. Yeah. That's strange. There's usually people here. (clears throat) Hello? (blows out a slow breath) That without my friends, and love, my strength would be nothing. I'm having a DBZ orgasm right now. Since last time. (cries out) He's a bad dude. It was Scanlan, Vax, and me against him-- -- and we were giving him everything we had with Craven Edge, and he was just shrugging it off, like-- Yeah, we were slashing through at his forearms and then he would, like, go (grunting sound) and all the wounds would heal. Who did he one-hit punch? The one punch? Yeah, and he could have killed Vax. With one punch. But he held it. He just held him one hit, like boom! And Vex went waaaaah! Sorry. He's a bad, bad dude. Well, the last time he was like, "Where does your strength come from?" And I'm like, "My rage!" And he kept kicking our asses, like, "Where does your strength come from!" I'm like, "My friends!" (all laugh) Okay. Come back soon, Sam! Happy birthday, Q! Happy birthday! There's not an infinite amount, but they're there. I think you should call him Breen Wiser Fester. Brain Fester is better. You didn't.
