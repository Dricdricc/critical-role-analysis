That's baby-making music right there, baby. It's because we're going to sweep these Briarwoods under the carpet! There's ugly Critmas sweaters. Watch us, au naturel. A satyr! Draw that shit first. (laughter) I think I'll do that tomorrow morning. That's a great idea. That's imitatable. Solid. It's so good. Yeah. Sam. Put your hand up by your face. Now high five me while I high five down on the count of three. One. You're going straight down, straight up. One, two, three (impact noise). Did it work? I've got to go lower. One, two, three (impact noise). You've got to wait 20 seconds. (laughter) They are so sexy. The only people that are in the light-- She only saw me and-- Can you dispel Seeming? How would we do that? Away from her. An early warning system? I vote for that. Percy, you're wearing what? What are you in disguise as? Before we dispel magic on her, should we have someone put her in their sights in case she gets a little funky monkey? We asked her who she was. She lied. A lot. I'll stay with Scanlan in case things go wrong. With Scanlan, also. Not looking friendly, neither. Thank you. (whispered) Now. Hopefully quieter than that. There you are. Yes, I'd say so. You want to be set free? That might happen if you're not careful. As far as we can see, unarmed? Right? Are you looking for ways to get back at the Briarwoods? Is good Percy casting Friends or shadow monster casting Friends? No, we have manacles. We should check any of the other cells? Nobody we're looking for is going to be above us, right? They're going to be below the castle. So we don't want her to get her shit in her room. We need to be asking how to get below the castle. We're not going to. Before we move on from that foyer, can we see the front door from where we're at? So we're not there yet, okay. Yeah, we're on a clock. You don't need to lower it. I have 20 caltrops. Can I throw ten of them in front of the door? Yeah. Thank you. One a day. (laughter) I'm back. (laughter) Pour some sugar on, Keyleth. I stay right next to her. Very, very slowly. Creepy? I'm going to put her through the wall if she moves in the wrong way. Keep your hands away and step back. What if it's enchanted armor? What are in those vials? One of them is? Or they both are? What about the other one? (laughter) Really. Lest your brains leak out your ears. Yeah, what does that mean? Axe. (laughter) I was only stretching. No need to get testy. Shit, Potion of Flying. I stand right behind her. I take a torch out of the Bag of Holding and I take the Firebrand War Hammer, ignite it, and hand the torch to Percy. It is? Where can we find this ziggurat? The city or this castle? We need to finish clearing this house now. I don't know if they're even here. Go. Lead the way. Yeah, we're not leaving Vax. The golden snitch is powerful. 21. That's the second roll. Feral instinct. Leave her. Somebody else-- Dead sprint after Percy. 50. LIAM and What the fuck did you do? All right, okay. 14. I know, is it me grinning, or is it dominated Grog? (laughter) Just do what you're going to do. So when you're dominated, does that mean charmed? Okay. I can't try and break the domination? Or rage? I'm not raging. So I only get two. It's a three. 21. 26. Really trying not to enjoy this. 18 for the first one. Bludgeoning, yeah. And fire. 20, 21. Yeah. Add wisdom right? 19? d10? Not quite my jam, but I'll still take it. (laughs) Shit. What the fuck? Am I flanked by two suits of armor or just one? I'll turn to him and rage. Regular rage, and swing away. Classic rage. 14? Nice. And 25. Nah, just two. Believe me, I know. 17 with the fire damage. First one. 18 on the second one. Nope. Yeah, twice. (quietly) We did do that. Misses. Hits. Both hit. Yeah! Scratch her up. Oh, you piece of shit Why did we let her have anything? I would like to move to the suit of armor please. 24? And 25. 20 with fire damage. And 16 with fire damage.
