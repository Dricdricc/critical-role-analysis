This is their 'build' theme. What did you do? We don't have to give these back, right? We can keep them? Megazord! They're VR, they're the VR headset. Yeah we do! Twins! What history do you remember? Yeah, man. So we need snorkels. Like a great herd of dolphins that we can commandeer? Yeah. And then just ride them-- LAURA and They do have a spike. For all of us. (sings) I want to go where the people are. Keyleth? I don't think she's done talking. Does it have to be tonight? Oh. Right, yeah. Good point. I hear you're not supposed to fight or kill anything for 30 minutes after you eat. I just say it, I don't know what it means. 30. (garbled) I'm peeing. I'm peeing in the water right now. Visibility. Do you want me to hold your glasses again for you? Go find out. What! Thank you, Ryan. Son of a bitch! So, all melee attacks are at disadvantage, because you're swinging through water. Fucking hate the ocean now. Like an airtight bubble. Yeah, yeah, be in a closed airtight space with a firearm, that will do wonders for your ears. Oh, sorry. Could you make some sort of cavernous hole out of Doty's chest? I mean, I'll touch Doty, but-- Like what? Barracuda! Does that exist? I have a question for you. I have two vials of underwater breathing from a long time ago. How long do those last? Like an hour? One hour? Do we know if the kraken is considered Thordak-sized or, humongous? Immense. Would that take away the speed halving? If we had webbed hands and feet, would that-- Right. So, Boots of Feral Leaping, I don't really-- unless we're on the bottom of the ocean. Right. We're not fucking whales. (whale noises) Maybe orcas, but they're not whales, right? They're like porpoises and shit. Important question. Do we know if the elemental plane is more like the waters off the Cayman Islands and it's crystal clear for hundreds of feet or is it like more murky, boggish Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico-type water? Light is also important. You back the fuck up right now. I understand that. No, I'm out. I'll stay on the land. Yeah, diversion. Bait. I like it. Way to volunteer, captain. No, we're fine. Yeah. So, if four of us are fast water creatures, right? Something that swims quick? What's our diversion? I volunteer as tribute. That would be a bad case scenario, 'cause I'm really slow, in that case. All sorts of fucked. How many hit points does a killer whale have? Oh, god, I thought you said nine. I nearly shit my pants. They have mouths? No, they have tentacles. I didn't hear anything about a beak or a mouth. Book. I'm staying in the water because I wanna feel the lightning. Yep. I was watching, but not that close. That scared me, I'm sorry. Oh shit. 25. Eight. Oh, that's terrible. Were you gonna-- you were gonna check your speed or something? All right Jesus Christ, let's move on! Yeah. Oh. No polymorph. Dry-erase boards. They're supposed to let you breathe underwater. I don't know if it pumps your guts full of air or anything. Underwater breathing. You guys, this is getting dumber and dumber. We will have a movement speed of one. We can't move it. It'll go straight to the bottom. Yep. Whale. Well, it needs to be one of you two. Trinket needs to go in the necklace 'cause of the odd man out. Okay. Easy, psycho. Oh. Take some of the dice out of your box. Are we supposed to go research the lodestones before we go to bed, right? The ones that are failing? Okay. Why don't we put it on and see what it does? Does the leather band attach at either end? I'm going to put it around my neck like a dog collar, and I'm going to lay down in the water face first. (distorted, vibrational voice) This is really cool! (all laugh) But, but-- But does it remedy the spell problem? Tary Jumbo-- I just thought of one thing for you, right? I went fishing this one time-- -- and the lure that I had was really shiny and sparkly, like fish love sparkly things in the water. And I'm just noticing now that you are really shiny and sparkly kind of all over. Yeah. I lost you at like the third word. What if we paint you in like black paint, or poo. All right, paint it is. Or tar. Should we tar him? You already are. What if we put you, like, in a potato sack? So, you've still got your armor but it just doesn't twinkle. No, no. Potato sack. Better not be flashy. Thanks. I go fishing a lot. I just want Vax and Keyleth to do the original Superman movie dialogue while he and Lois are flying. "Can you hear my thoughts?" "Can you read my mind?" (all laugh) Sick. I need to be a whale. Are there any seashells on the floor that I could find? Pretty shells? I don't want yours. I'm a whale. Yeah. What does it do? What does it do? What's the matter with you? Why are you talking like that? Right, yeah. Knew it. Making sure you knew. Right at the fucking start. Don't we have to examine shit first? With our non-flipper hands? We're not going to tell you what to do here. Imagine endless water. No possible-- bottomless. We barely knew him. Bring him along. That was quick. Oh my god. What do we even have you here for, I mean? The snitch returns. You have a compass? Equalizing. And it shatters. Any other tests you brainy types want to do on these giant, green balls? Are we ready? Immense? Your beard is glorious. Yeah, hold on. Are there any barnacles down here I can put in that? Is it fast in the water? Oh, yeah? Giveaway! Do you sense calamari? I think you should just get all of them An animal. A mineral. (all laugh) This is really important. I fart. Do the bubbles go up? We're in a safe place. I don't know, I don't know! Looking up, can you see any sort of surface to the water, like you would if you were 150, 200 feet, scuba-diving down, and-- That's what I thought. We in it. Yes. Yep. Movement, light, shiny things, all bad. Through the portal behind you. I know, I know, I know. How far away can you place that? Right. You give him a hard time. Like trying to get a rat in a bath. You're drowning him, baby. Say goodbye to him. Don't fuck me, Gil. 25. 25. Yeah, man. Yeah? 18. Do we see anything swimming above us or around us? I slowly make my way to the other side of the wall. Okay. Come on, Gil. Nice. Just regular, right? No plus ten. Oh, sorry. 27. Yeah, I do that. Especially with that giant red rock right there. Oh! 16! Free in the water Feed the fish. Wait, quick question. Krakens don't like use shells do they like a crab? Okay. Just checking. No, no, I'm-- I'm keeping an eye out. I'm the lookout. (mimics music) Hey, you two, it's not a race. You sure it's a rock? Staying there. Do you really think Daylight's gonna help at this point? Oh, thank god I have advantage. 14 for Groggy Grog. What's that mean? Nice! Great, thank you. Yes, thank you. A lair action for the kraken? 'Cause we're in its fucking fish-tank. Fuck you, Costco. I meant Petco. With my #blessed, 27. Nine? Bless bless. You're throwing a meatball past a lion that's stalking you. It'll be like, "Yeah, fuck these treats. I want that meatball." (watch talking) (watch talking) (watch talking) (watch says "Zero miles") Wow, Siri's fucking drunk right now. (all laugh) "Elevated heart rate." "Please, take a moment to breathe." (all laugh) And a giant megalodon comes and eats it. (all laugh) 22. One damn. Yeah! It sure hits. You got a problem with-- Do it. Full blast. Cool. It's just trying to get a feel for the friends that are in its space. It's my turn? I would like to watery rage. Yeah that's my bonus action. And can I smash the titanstone knuckles together to cast Enlarge on myself? Yeah, I'm a bigger fish now. Can I fight with the strength of the (sings) titanstone knuckles to break that grapple? It is an action. He just got a bigger chew toy. Sweet. I'm digging it. That's my turn. Can't do anything else. Holy shit. Don't act like you have to choose who it goes on. But one of us does not look concerned. Just go get the lodestones. Wisdom. Break him. #blessed Constitution, right? 32, and I have resistance to lightning damage with the Exalted Knuckles. It's like a crustacean beholder. Gra-pelled? Trinket's pretty low (laughs). Totally loses. 11, but I have resistance to lightning damage. That hits. Cool. Cool. I'm in the womb again. There's fluid. Do I hear a heartbeat? Nice. Right. Cool. Am I restrained anymore? Because I'm in the gut? Nice, cool, yeah. That threw off my plan. How about-- Yeah, let's try-- God, can I even make a melee attack here? Yeah, let's give it a whirl, and I'll make it a reckless attack. Bless. Yeah, I'm still blessed. That's a 30. 23. Nah, I'm hitting it with the dwarven thrower. Two hits. Yeah. Yeah. 10. 26. 22. And my bonus action-- I would like to be very discouraged about my current state of affairs. Yep, just regular. Can I use my bonus action to go into a frenzied rage because I have never been swallowed? And I don't like it. Fuck this big squid. We can kill them, too, it's not a problem. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Ooh! Oh my god. (cackles) I like this thing. Well, fuck. No need to add it up. Don't worry about me. Nice. Were we supposed to get something? Yes! Awesome. Just like her. Does it have to be at disadvantage? Yes. 13. It does have that armored out like a lobster? It's not soft and rubbery like an octopus? Okay. You make Sebastian the crab. Yeah, he is so ready to use a tentacle on the hunter shark. Jeez. (sings) Everybody was grappled underwater! We're all... fucked enchiladas. You just faceplant. Selfish. (cackles) That's a piece of shit. I love it. Yes? Yeah. I'm sure it ain't great. I'm sure it ain't like being at a fucking spa. Okay. Fuck. This little bastard's high-spirited. Well, now it's a tribute. (fart noise) I'm here! Right. Can I reach around? Do I feel any dangly bits or something I might be able to yank on? Or is it smooth? I know I'm like this, but-- There's no way that I could try and push out with my legs to try and pull something out of the bag of holding, is there? It's too tight for that. Maybe the alchemy jug? I pull out the alchemy jug. And I get super fucking wasted-- No, I'm kidding. (all laugh) Yeah. You know, sea creatures like oil. Yeah. Yup! Yeah! Hey, man, you're making progress. You're A1 sauce right now brother, you're doing all the good things. It had ten. Ha, just you and me live. (all laugh) What, jesus, I'm right fucking here. Yes, it sucks. And oil. Oh! Is it not just floating amniotic, like water, in this esophagi? Anatomy. I'm a big fan of this. Yeah get your Zantac 75 now, bitch. I'm at advantage, though, so I just roll one. 11. Oh wait, man, wait, blessed. 13. Oh, like a, 13. I do have fire resistance, so I'm okay. I'm excited about this. 25. 25 exactly? Wow. Alchemy jug! 15. To half because I have fire resistance. So 39. 22 to me, because, resistance. Did you? (all yell) It's a 15, but I have resistance, so-- In front? Awesome. Does Grog? He's grappled. Trinket's grappled. Ha! Ha! Am I near Keyleth? Great! I'm going to use my action to shove a greater healing potion in your stupid unconscious mouth. (all laugh) I roll that? No. Great. Four, six, eight, 12! I do! I want to (doop doop doop) like Mario in the water world, and I want to go up on top of the kraken's face, and I want to punch him in his stupid big eyeball with the dwarven thrower. Yep. Reckless! Yep. 28. That's 14, 25. 25! 25. Eyeball took it pretty well, man, jeez. Those eyeballs are hard. It does. I am whaling on its head. Yeah. It's your Aramente. It's your Aramente. TALIESIN and And we still are blessed, right? Hold on. He throws water at us. 32. Great. Yeah. Halved to 12. 24. Okay. Can I make a retaliation since he smacked me? The tentacle. Reckless. That's a 31. Seven, 22. May I make my first strike a vengeance upon that stupid tentacle? Yep. Reckless! That was not a roll. 30. One, 16 points of damage. Sweet. Who's in the tentacle next to me? Who's in the tentacle next to me? I mosey over to the one that Keyleth is in. And I will smash that tentacle. Should I go ahead and roll? That's a natural 20. Yeah. Which is a nine. TRAVIS and And I get a two additional damage die. Okay. Actually, I do nine plus the rage damage, and then I just roll this twice. Right. Okay, so that's-- Cool. (all laugh) Not that you even need it, but I try and release Vax as well. Reckless! 16. 30-- 20-- 32. Cool. Seven. 22. Cool. I am going to biggity-buck the fat out! (all laugh) No, 'cause I don't have that! Oh, but that-- Nice. Thank you. Making real good distance. Are we all at disadvantage on the dex throws? Okay, so I get two. 17 for me. Oh, wait! Blessed. Blessed! #Blessed, bitch! 19. Weep! (laughs) Unconscience? Take it easy there, champ. Take it real slow. Yep. Love America. I'm gonna kill this stupid sea puppy. An ink cloud. Can we get some ammonia that we can pour on a cloth and just, like, take a big whiff of? I think there's some in the first aid kit in the hallway. I'm pretty sure I stole some last week. Yeah! 22. How many tentacles does it have? What turn's that? How many tentacles were left, like three? Five. Oh, he does not swallow you. Holy fucking shit. This is insane. Oh my god. Oh shit. Um. An intelligence check? Hold on, everybody. Prepare for an amazing-- Nine. I am gonna attack this big stupid sea-chicken. Wait, I mean-- yeah. Yeah. Yeah, can I aim for one of its tentacles that is functioning? Cool. Reckless. Natural 20. Should've made it-- That's a-- Ten, plus, 25, 30, 35. I'll take the next tentacle that works. It's very unprotected. Apparently, my hammer is talking to me. Reckless attack. 23. Okay. 17. Last attack-- that tentacle's still fine, right? Yeah. All right, Reckless. 31. Ten. 25. Yeah, so one of 'em's on Tary, and there are two free? Okay. I am going to use my not incredible speed to just-- I'm gonna just end my turn. Yep. I think that hits. Okay. I would like to make a Retaliatory Attack. A Retali-tali-- The one that grappled me. Reckless. That's a 31 again. Okay. 21. Did it work? Vax is inside-- I'm not Blessed anymore, am I? Didn't you just heal yourself a little bit more, though? 20-- 23 and resistance. Me? What about him? I only have one. Yeah. That hits. 11. Can I make a retalito-ri-teh? I did. Am I grappled or did he just bitch slap me? Okay, cool. Hah! Okay, so that's? 14. You guys think this is part of a plan. Fuck this tiny hole shit. Ah, it's my turn now? I don't even get like a second to think about it? I take a greater healing potion. Can I reach Vax at all? Can I find any part of his foot or anything and pull him down to me? It's not for me. Is he rough at all? Even close? LIAM and Right, and those tentacles-- the tentacles don't count towards his overall damage? (sighs loudly) What a choice. I am going to-- fuck it, I'm gonna make an investigation check for Vax. That's a big natural one. All right, I'll take the potion myself. Yeah. It's a greater, my last greater 4d4 plus four. Seven, eight-- 11, 12. 16. 16 points of healing. Disable those tentacles, man. No, we gotta do it from the inside. Can you chew it? Oh, I forgot she's unconscious, too. Back in the game. This is mindblowing. But the shark is so dangerous. Let us whoop the everloving shit out of the inside of this kraken, Reckless, everything. Yeah. Just all three attacks, just hitting it-- It's not really a great weapon. Oh yeah? It's just a hammer, it's not like a greatsword or a greataxe. I thought maybe it was-- I'll make 'em Reckless, though. All three. 29. Hits, right? I'm just gonna roll the damage. First is a 20. Second one is a 22. Hits? Okay, good. 24 points of damage. Last one is a natural 20. (all cheer) That's a ten, that's 44, and that's seven, so that's 51 points of damage. 51 points of damage to it. I do have my movement-- I am going to-- it's such a short shitty movement-- -- can I just rotate around him towards the door and stay within. As far as I can get. Halved, yep. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Really? What the fuck? Who just vanished? Where are you going? And I have advantage. 17. With resistance? Okay, so just four. That's right. That hits. To five? Oh, ten is reduced? Okay. And can I make my Retaliatory? Reckless. 23. That is also a 23. I'm not grappled? Yeah, he didn't do anything. That's good. 20. No more blessed. Yeah, hashtag no more blessed. 20 and resistance for me. So it was? Sorry. Seven. Are you really? Are you really? Where are you? I'm gonna take the coin-- -- I'm gonna Alter Self. I'm gonna grow gills and fins. I see Tary fall... and I... ... bolt for the portal. Yep. And can I, can I like-- -- can I like double my speed? I do. That's right, 50. Do I make it to the portal? What? Oh! (all laugh) 19. Don't complicate this. Don't complicate this, I think we'll be okay. I think. I'm okay. I'm all right. I don't even know what that is. Three. Five. Zero modifier. I don't know what that is. Through the water? The nitwit. That's-- okay. The nitwit. Who do you think I'd think the nitwit is? You did cast Friends, so. Technically, I would think nitwit is me, and I'd be like, okay, here I go. No, he cast Friends, and the whole point is to-- yeah. Yeah, that's a DM call. It's not quite my call. How many? I am going to aquaman run over to Tary. Yep. Maybe I just wanna grab the bag. He cast Friends, right? So I wouldn't want to make Percy mad. I pick up Tary. Do I have anything to toss him through that thing? Can I take one of the tiny little healing potions, the regular-ass ones? I have one. I forget what it's called. 2d4 plus two? 16. Halved to seven. Pssh. We'll see-- --Friend. We'll find out. That is a bad, bad creature. I don't know what that means. To eight? Nine? That hits. Mm-hm. All three attacks-- -- Reckless. That's a 32. It's 20 points of damage on the first one. 26 is the hit for the second one. 24 points of damage on the second one. And then 23. With 19 points of damage on the third one. With the rest of my movement, can I turn around and look at him and go, yo, O Ancient One, can you read my mind now? And I walk through the portal. Just double birds. Titan creatures? Titan creatures. We don't know. We don't know. Wow. I underestimated that whole thing. Thank you, Loot Crate! Eight. Eight hit points. 65, 61, 51, 44, 39, 27, 33, 26, 17, eight. If I didn't get barfed, we would have problems. I guess Tary lives another day. Thank you, Lootcrate! Not for another week!
