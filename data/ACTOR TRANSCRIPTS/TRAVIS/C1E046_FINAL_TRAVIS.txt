Put the leg of the table between here. Lock it up, right table, Jesus! The whole time. This is the next of our shirt designs-- -- the Strongjaw Ale shirt design, which will be on sale tomorrow at our Wondercon panel and the Geek and Sundry store as well. Aged six months in a Bag of Holding. (laughter) Upside-down only. (belches) Yeah, I know, it comes from her, though, she's like a howitzer, it's a whole other thing. It'll make your shirt move, it's legit. Telephone rings. Hello? (belches) -- he said in a weird way. (scoffs and laughs) Is he serious? Yeah, you're better than good, buddy. Scanlan, can you do that? Oh. Yes! With triple advantage? 25. Incredible. Sorry. Wow. Are we killing this one? He is. Wait, are they special candles or are they simple candles? Something larger things, sometimes smaller things. Well maybe, like, if you give us one of those tragedy candles, we can always light it for somebody. That could be good down the road. We bake somebody a cake, we shove a candle in the top, and we give it to them. Well, that's what I meant, yeah. Aren't we supposed to be doing something really like-- What was your name, one more time? Yeah, okay. Well, let's go, let's move along then, Gern, yeah? You good to come along with your herd of-- We move along. Stealthily. Shush! Stealthily. Fuck. Yeah! (whistles) Gern, son of a bitch. Is this the first time you've done that? Keyleth! Are you all right? Kind of following your lead here. Yeah, sure it fails you. Ha. Thought I made a point. We don't know what happened, why are we clapping? Is she talking in normal, or is she talking in the (flickering flames). Yeah, no idea what you're doing or saying. I think so. I might have to tackle you if you don't calm the fuck down. So, they're going back. Do we move on? Yeah, but it's on fire. Roll high. Even better. Ooh, really? Yeah. Better ask first. Oh, are you hot right now? It's so weird. Oh, all right. Fancy cloak. Dang. I think that's a good way to start. Putting on the Ritz! When I see the salamander take out the big, shiny sharp thing, I go into a rage. Yeah. The candle turned into a blizzard, so. Ooh! No. What is that crater? Is that just a crater? That crater's just a crater, though? Fucking Percy. Jesus. Every time. You motherfucker. 17. Because eff that. Yes! He went the long way. Oh, okay. Fatty just don't want to die. Can I use, I guess, my entire action to run towards Scanlan? 50. That's about it, huh? Nah, we need to spread out. Can I go back and arc the other way? Can I run to the left as far as I can? No, from where my starting point was. Yeah. Yeah, back towards you, around the pool. I fall out of my rage, yeah. So I fall out of it. Can I throw something? I guess I can, yeah. Can I attach the Chain of Returning to Craven Edge? And I'll throw it at trident-less bastard right there, yeah. Only 14. Yeah. Thing to pull it back. Strength. 18. Keeping my rage. What? Focus, focus. That's nice. Towards the portal. Scanlan Shorthalt! So if they're frozen, does that mean they're dead? Yeah, can I walk over there close to them? Can I make my way to the two frozen statue-types? Or three of 'em, yeah. Fatty Arbuckle. Can I make my way over to one of them and-- should I just make sure they're dead? Yeah, yeah, can I push Trident-dick over? Come on. Ooh, like the T-1000. Yeah, I dunno. Oh yeah, can I go over and do the other one, like, (giggles). Can I pick him up and walk him back over to Gern and go sorry. You don't want him? Probably. I don't think this will be bad 20. Fuck! Jude. Eight. Oh shit, towers. No, no, he was down in the play zone before! Oh, absolutely. Two. Whoa! Get out of here, dragonborn! Feel like we're in MegaMan. A MegaMan boss. Kick us off strong! My name's Grog. You need to sacrifice a small mammal. Maybe we can find a squirrel or something. A pagan ritual. (laughter) Why am I not surprised? Wisdom. I just answered the first thing that popped into my head. Hey! I don't think he has any blood, though. Jeez, leave some for the rest of us, big boy. It's the "schlogel." Grubs? I would like to rush up where Scanlan is, and attack that little guy on the ground there. No, not you, the other guy that's next to him. And can I use a reckless attack-- Oh yeah, raging. I would like to rage. And then use reckless attack against him! 24? 23. Awesome. 18 on the first one. And 23. Yes. She gave me resistance, so halved to three? Halved to two. Eight total. Oh, you brought a fork to a sword fight. Oh shit, that hits. Halved. That misses! Feels nice here. Maybe a timeshare. It's pissed off in a ball. He's like, first the beholder, now my flame genie. That's our rogue. Love the way you're rolling today. Just roll the dice. I use another reckless attack and I make the first strike against the guy right in front of me. Jesus. Better. 14. Damn it. No, just reckless attack. This one is with great weapon master. Nope. Better. 16 plus nine is 25, minus five is 20. Yahtzee! Five, ten, 18, 28! Like freckles. Yeah, that's the end of my turn. Darling, shush. Genie hamster. No, no, he's still alive! And I kick him. Now he's dead. Does the dagger stay in his eye socket? Ooh. Can I reach down and grab it? Holy shit! I look back at Vax. I don't know! I think maybe I'm a magic user now! And I start trying to cast reanimate person on the dead thing. No, no, no, I've got to concentrate! (straining) Like you do. Six. Must be a rookie mistake. He's over lava. All right, fuck it-- This is your thing. All right, fuck it, now I just run, in a rage, I run into the lava and I start shoving him straight toward the flaming vagina hole. Yeah, I'll use another one. So 12. I rolled a 22. I just want you to know, I was trying to free you. Can you believe how rude these people are? Trauma from the earlier episodes. Hunter's Mark! Disintegrate? 10d6? At least they're dancing while I'm standing on fire. Both kills! Both of them! I run over in the lava and I go, I'd like to cast Beheading! Not a problem. Totally worth it for the spell. I grab it! (panting) I run out of the lake. Aw, shit. Do you think so? It feels like it's an intimate thing. All right. Okay! That makes perfect sense. Brave Coral. Like an old orange. Oh, I'll teach you later. I have a Firebrand Warhammer. I could hit it. Anybody else got anything better? Your Dimension Door? Yeah, spit it up. Come on, Vax. Nice job, Vax! Yeah, cool, do that. I'm going to walk out of the lava now. (laughter) You're a really good person. Holy shit! That scimitar that the genie had, did it fall into the lava? Does the skeleton go with him, or does it stay? Whitestone. You could give him five pounds of dragon scales. Do you need me to help you with the tree spell? That's amazing. Feel the Gern! She's wanted to fly so much.
