That asshole? No, we're good. Sam's art is really rare. For no other reason than for those Sam Riegel advertisements at the beginning. Punisher. Did you lose a second one? He's like iPhones, they just come out every so often. With us in it? Is it a stupid idea to shoot another Oracle Arrow through this one and see if it looks the same? I can make room in the Bag of Holding for the armor, but I have to get rid of one of these two bodies. Does anybody object if I throw one of the bodies at the little black marble? I have to what? Oh right, okay. So can I walk back to the fork? Back to the fork. I pull out-- both? We only need one. I pull one body out. Listen, I'll run my store the way I run my store. I pull one body out. What an analogy. The sausage without the casing. Close the Bag of Holding and I just drag him back over. Everybody ready? And a one, and a two, and a (whoosh). It really doesn't seem that bad. I literally just walked all the way over there and now you want me to go back? I walk back out of the realm of the thing, pinching my belly fat because apparently Percy thinks I'm a couple pounds heavy. I'll pull the other Slim Jim out of the bag. That was pretty-- I mean, from a third party, non-influenced or partial perspective, flipping gravity was pretty cool. I don't know, Pike. Can he earn his way back in in this manner? Radiant means all gods or just good gods? Yeah, there's still an idiot in this group. No. Didn't we talk about this? Ooh, hey! Is he heavy? Don't you have your own Bag of Holding? Oh. I'll just give him mine. (laughter) Yep. Oh, me? (happy grunts) Is that permission? That's amazing. I'll go for it, and I'll whack on a wall. Do I just hit a wall anywhere? Okay, I'm ready any time. Or should we wait 'til we collapse the tunnels? Yeah, I'm sure it won't fall on me. No big deal. Yeah! That's why I said stay, but that's all right! I do have just a regular pickaxe. Okay, Pike. I want you to warm up this spot for me, and then you're going to jump on my back and then I'm going to hit it. No, no, you hit it. Yeah, and then you can come up on my back. Ready to run, just in case she just goes beast mode. All right. Get on, Yoda. I rage first. 23. I forgot we had to roll for this part. I got advantage. Oh, that's good. 20. No-- 18. (groan) Nice job! Fruit? Fruit? Are you hungry? Hold on. I hold up Pike to go grab some fruit. Don't worry, it's just fruit. Yeah, I got great nature skills! Five. What? Why? It's just fruit! You know, I've found if fruit, when it goes bad, falls from the tree, and it's still on it! Therefore! You get crunk drunk! I'm going to have a bite. (disgusted noises) I take out the jug and I go honey! Hey! Jug goes away. They die. Yeah, I bet Clarota's in there. Oh thanks! Oh, right, yeah! No. You should try the local fruit. It's delicious. It belies its true flavor. Oh, great. How do we get back to Whitestone? Yeah, you're writing a book! Are you a colonel, a general, a private? Yeah, rolling eyes. That was a fucking awesome physical reaction. Yes. I'm in the kitchen. I want to see if they can make a salad with meat in it. Okay, I'm not very up to-- This is far greater than anything I could have hoped for. Did you invent this just now? Chef, this is going to put you on the map. We need to name it. What fine tender meats are in this dish? Please, yes! I'm talking to myself. I'm just free-dripping saliva in and on the plate. I mean, did you even, like, salt it or nothing? It's just all these beautiful animals in my own private ark of a bowl? Well, because it's got goat, fish, beef, and pork in it I'm going to call it the GoFiBePo. But, like, you seem to have an accent, so let's put a little flair on it when you say it. The bowl of GoFiBePo. I like it. And I must decree there will be no utensils used when you dine of this sublime dish. Approval? This just gets better and better. Submit whatever paperwork is necessary. See that it's done. (laughter) GoFiBePo. Even better. And I'll just start hand-smashing into my face this delicious salted meat collection. You should not be able to make up food that delicious just on the fly like that. I literally felt like I was at a fucking restaurant. That was absurd. Meat salad. You're welcome. Yeah! After every battle, we'll get all the protein we need and we'll just fart our happy asses off, all night long. Boring. Yeah, great name. Are ziggurats always pyramids? The thing we fought the beholder in. So collapsing the tunnels didn't really do that much. So all the bodies that were hanging under Whitestone, right, they were all stapled to the walls? Was that the army? Was she trying to fill them with necromantic energy? Yeah. The bodies weren't feeding the thing. She was trying to imbue them with-- Why were they throwing magical things into it, though? It was magical items into-- We don't know that any of this is right. We should just go through. We did let her regroup a little bit, but we didn't know what we were doing. Do you want to mess with the stones? Try and duplicate them? We have seven, right? Tary's staying. If we take damage going through the portal with the stone, does that mean we might take damage if you Plane Shift us there? Yeah. Yes. Tally-ho? Which ones? Make the call. I would eat there all the time. The open palm? 30 souls just sitting in a rock. You think my shit's weird? That one. I'm game. I also thought of something overnight. All right? It hurt, because it's kind of brilliant. Can you hold your breath for-- (whispering) what's higher than ten? 11 seconds. Why don't all you bitches just hop in the Bag of Holding, I jump through, take all the damage for us, and then you just (popping sounds) pop right back out? What could it possibly be? Have you ever been in one? But it has to be able to hold its breath. If we throw a dog in there-- Yeah, there's no air, I don't think. If you want to do CPR, whatever. We should find out. Are you going in? I'll go in. All right. I just wanted to put it out there. We can all take the stones and go through. I bet it's not going to be that bad of a deal. Just wanted to put it out there if you wanted to live on the edge of life, but no, we'll just do it the boring way. That is a face that says, I'm giving you nothing. (groans) Garlic chicken. I blew it that way, though. It's probably me. Let's go. We've got a mansion. Let's go down to the ziggurat. Yeah. If we put on the robes, we've got to pull out an eyeball each, too. We're going down to the ziggurat. That's a lot of dice. I'm game. I'll go. Nine. Really, Percy? The Rand McNally guide, yeah. The structures to our left and our right, are they solid, do they have focus? Any of you with the eyes, can you see what that is up in the air? 18. (nervous laughter) What the fuck? Oh my god. It was an otter. I love otters. Can I pop my head back out the door, and looking at the ground, is there any semblance of a sewer system or a runoff grate or anything? Oh Jesus. Yeah, bitch. Seven. What? I'm keeping a lookout. Do we notice anything strange about the little necklaces that we're wearing now that we're in this place? I definitely want an eyeball hanging out. I raise my blood axe... Cover and ambush? Find cover. I'm going into the building. They were walking towards us. A censer? And if he's successfully thrown, I just cover his mouth and grab the back of his head and squeeze. Ew, God. Cover his mouth. Oh, that's a million. 26. Percy, will you give him a reminder not to move? Yeah, when I take my hand off his mouth. Our quarry, does he have two eyes? That was nasty, it was real good. Just ask him some questions before the fun begins. Let's see what he answers with. No, that's just me. What's flying around in the sky? Sentinels. Gloom Stalkers. That is a great name. They also look fearsome. Do people cower before them in their presence? I'll bet. I am easily startled. He's back. What do they do? What other alarms are there in the city that would detect outsiders? Can he take us safely to the tower? I poke him in his remaining eyeball. Oh God. 25. Oh, what was that? It matters not? Oh, are you going to be rewarded? Yeah. How many middle fingers am I holding up? Why? I like misery. He's yelling. He'll make all sorts of sound. Great word. Should we let you back out so you can find your way back? (crack) I'm putting him in the Bag of Holding as you're talking. This is the best setup ever!
