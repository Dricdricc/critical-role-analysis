Woohoo! Oh my god. You got a gun, you got a staff, You've got-- Is that a skull of your, like, younger brother? Oh, nice! That's not dark, at all. (mutters) What the fuck? (laughter) What's the fleshy thing in front of you? Those are huge! He wants a sex puppet. Come on, guys. She has so many dice now, it's ridiculous Come on, buddy. Constitution? Or amazing, depending on who you are. Fucked up, yeah. Meteorite wins everything. You chunked! What?! Yeah, he's like Rudy. He's outside! Hey, buddy! Did you roll the meteorite yet? You ding-a-ling! No, we didn't. And everything's gone horribly wrong because of that. That's not what you said. Yeah, an ogre comes up to his waist. Good job! You Dominated it earlier. I just run towards the pleasant smells. A what? Awesome. When did that happen? So we've got two rounds to-- Good choice. Four more. Oh, that makes sense. How many would've done it? Roll the meteorite. You're real little, like the size of a toe. What, they can't take it? Tee-balls you. Good. Yes! All right. Drop it. I don't know, can you? There you go. Roll well. Yeah, right? Couldn't just let him go in the trees. Yes! Is he a giant? Like a giant? I speak Giant! I speak Giant! Oh, I can use my brain for something? 17. I hold off on Raging. I can't talk, right? If I'm freaking out? Right. So I call out in Giant, "Nipple Taint, Knuckle Broom!" which means, "Brother! We "seek to fight a great evil! Perchance, would thou carest to join us in such a fight? I have ale." Yeah, yeah. Would you like to join us? We're not worth the trouble. But we would love to pay you in ale to join us on a much better fight. That's pretty bad. That's the same number. (laughter) Impressive. Fuck it. I rage! (laughter) Son of a bitch. Can I rage as a bonus action? (incoherent rage shouting) I know, I'm right at testicle height. Which is not good. No, I'll stay right where I am. Can I try to talk to him? I don't know if I can. She'll be fine! Just roll really high both times. You're putting the hurt on him. Oh, oh! (normal volume) What? What was your thing? We have have manacles, and we have chains. I don't wanna! Oh yeah, what was he dragging? Wasn't there a corpse? I don't think we can. Can you make the manacles big? Can you Engorge the-- Can you make the manacles bigger? Giant-sized? Like Harry Potter! Engorgio! No? Fuck! We should drag him over there, just in case he wakes up. Kick him in. It's 150 feet. Should we put a fancy robe over his nasty eye, so he can't give you the-- We have eight fancy robes. I take one of them and I put it over his nasty pirate eye. They were in the closet, nobody wanted them! But now they're coming to use, so suck it up. While they're chaining him up and everything, I'd like to walk up and put my great axe just under his chin. Just as a reminder. Classic line. They all work on me. There's nothing in there. I keep drinking out of it. There's nothing in it! Right. I speak two languages! No, but not, no. No, good, yeah. Yeah, you got it. Back of the throat. A man of few words. Christ. Temple. (laughs) Jesus! (laughter) I didn't even understand what-- (laughs) Awesome! Will you inspect it? (singsong) I have something that's magic. Penelope. But what if he just controls the giant? I also have an idea. Ice cream and peanut butter mixed on a cold stone. I've been thinking about it for days. I told you, I don't like thinking. Right? Doesn't that sound amazing? I'm just saying, we could leave this fucker here, go mix some peanut butter and ice cream, everybody's happy! Liam, we need you to stealth in and get some awesome recon, but that means you'll be at risk. I think Pike's onto something. We have four acid vials, plus that. Remember, the argument was also that it will be magically treated to withstand simple acid. Yeah, here. You can have it. Here. How about a sapphire? My fine blue sapphire that's been in here for a year and a half. You can have it. It's coming back to me, don't reach for it. I'll take the sapphire back. I could just jump on it. (high-pitched) Yeah, that's all right. Yeah, I like that more. Yes. One question. If we break the thing at the top and the upside-down Christmas tree falls into the Elder Brain pool thing, are we going to kill all of the illithids in the city in one fell swoop? I'm full of those, but let's hear yours. Who wants to go up on top? Who would want to go down? Like Phantom of the Opera. Are you looking to me to bend it. I was like, can you metalbend? This is awesome. But you want me to get my sweet hands on it? How do I get to it, though? I mean, if we break-- No, I can't. It doesn't carry me. I could be like that pilot at the end of Independence Day that's just flying up into the-- (laughter) Randy Quaid, which I've always aspired to be. I'm in, I'll do it. We're talking about a chance to gamble with his life. Let's let him do it. Let's do it. Nap! We nap and rest. Grand merci. Without your shirt on. Yeah yeah. Like five minutes max. MATT AND I offer him a sip from the cask of ale. Right, just a sip. Don't do this to me. Don't do it. I will fucking kill you! I would like-- (grunts) 12! I run up his fat chest and I headbutt him in the face! It's my cask of ale! Natural 20! You don't fuck with Grog's cask of ale! Hey, it might be like a Fomorian thing! He might like it! You owe me a cask of ale. I'm grieving now. Leave me be. (tearfully) My cask of ale! All right. I've had that cask for two years, man! Thank you, Tiberius. Thank you. Woobie it is. Henceforth it shall be called Woobie. Yes. The stealthiest of the stealthy go. Yeah. A little recon and then we-- Yeah. Is it just dexterity you can enhance, or anything? It flashes? Sentries? Puberty's a bitch. Tiny and I had a meeting of the minds. We could provide a distraction. I don't give a shit. Chaotic Neutral, baby! Yeah, there's going to be collateral damage. We don't want to go in. Yeah, they did exile him. So are we saying we want to go up to the top, we want to try and weaken the cross with the yellow and the acid, we want to drop Titmouse, the giant, on the thing, hopefully, if it breaks. If it doesn't break, then what do we do? Let's do it. Quit tip-toeing into the ocean, let's run into this. He doesn't need doors, right? He can make portals and shit? No, we're trying to keep him from calling in a fucking dragon or something. He can't Dimension Door in a dragon and be like, "Just kidding." But he can't-- I think hotboxing is now-- No? I could give the four acid vials to whoever has the yellow liquid who wants that responsibility. The yellow liquid? So who wants to pour the acid on the cross? I could do that, but it's-- I'm at everybody's disposal. We do. Yeah. I give him a glass vial. Sorry. One last question. So his eye cancels out magic, right? So the more places we make him look, the more of a chance we have to get it away from the magic users, right? LAURA AND So instead of just two people, why don't we do all three? If there are two doors, and the skylight, why don't we have three teams so he has to pick which one he looks at? I mean, I can take one of the doors at the bottom and try and keep people from coming in. Okay, what else were you going to say? Is anybody interested in going underneath the pyramid with me? Okay. And just scatter to different areas so he has to look around. We can't stay together. No no. Yeah. Butthole only. Which it's bound to do. Yeah, we're all in different places. But if we're all around the room, let's say we've got in there and it's fallen off and we're all around the thing. You can't all whip us out of there. We have to be in one area, right? No no no. I was asking, you can't teleport a room out, we have to be together, right? But we have to be near you, right? We might not have that luxury. Should we have a run-away word, a safety word, like Oklahoma, or something? Yeah. You are. So, one problem is-- We're still coming in-- I know, I know. We're all still coming in through one area, though. It's like the fatal funnel. It's like a doorway. If you all come in through the doorway, you're all in one spot. This guy has, like, 12 dick-finger eyes. It's all bad. It's all bad. All right. I'm all ears. Okay. He'll read our minds. He's already in our heads. No, I-- All right. Yeah, anything that'll just split up where he looks. That's all I wanna do. Okay. Good, good. No no. You Levitate me, right? That's true! We don't want to sacrifice that. Yeah, why not? Can we make two trips? We have-- We have two carpets. Two carpets. We're going to make two trips and come back for seconds. Okay. Yeah, she means it. Yeah, it's not like you'll be there to collect. On the, you know, props. If you die. And we'll fly the carpet back. Right. So we'll fly. And then we'll fly the carpet back. He's going to drop me off on the first trip, take Fly off of me, he'll get on the carpet, come back for the second group, and Fly Trinket. That's what I mean, once I'm up on the temple, you take it off of me. And then you can put it on Trinket, because I'll be chilling on the top. Which you can't do? How the fuck do we get him up there? We are doing shifts, right? I mean, I weight 645 pounds, so a lot. Okay. Let's do it. 21. Oh, plus ten? 31. Still alive. He rolled three times. We are definitely staying out of any kind of visible sight of the giant meatball. Don't do it. We all start going, "Go home, bats." Let's do this. Oh, we're so finished. And I also pull out my climbing equipment and my 200 feet of rope out of the Bag of Holding. And start putting the climbing gear on. 23. She has that, actually. Okay. I've got a wooden handle. Yeah. It's not weakened enough yet, is it? We get him in place and then try it, and if it makes a noise, we just drop him? Shoot him up, and have him come down. We need him to fall, like King Kong from the Empire State building. What if we-- If we give ourselves away, what do we lose? A lot? I don't think it's worth it. Well, we'll give away-- So if, like, we try and weaken and the metal makes any noise, anything, right? Jig's up. Yeah, at least it's going through. Like, we won't have even gotten through-- And even if it doesn't, it might be better than trying to crank it. Yeah, why not? Wouldn't hurt. Are you doing the, "It's been an honor to serve with you, sir"? It'll just fall in? It won't go straight down. Shall we execute Manhattan Project? No, experimentees. I think I just caked my pants a little bit. You're good. Before it falls, I would like to rage. Me? Oh, for Pike. So Death Ward, if you go down to zero, it will put you at a one, it won't take you under? Does anybody else want Death Ward? Right as he lets him go. We need the mass. He wanted us to come in through the bottom, probably. Fuck, balls, tits, ass. 20. Who's behind-- Can I see who's behind me in initiative? So, with the climbing harness and the rope, I speed-rope into the room and take cover behind the pool. Can I hide behind the pool on the opposite side of-- Yeah. Opposite of him so I can, like, hide behind the pool. Yeah. Like, even going prone if I have to. Yep. That's it. Yeah, can I bury my face in my arms like this, on the ground? Like this? It's like, face down. I love how nobody's saying shit, 'cause we're all terrified. He's looking at me, he's looking at me. He's hurting. (sings) Shit, shit, shit. And it gets three eyes every turn. Form tackle this bitch. At least five. Yeah, do you mean, Oklahoma? Time to go? Okay. Safety word. Fuck Clarota. Smoke that dude. Fuck Clarota. Yeah! Do it! Whatever that is! 44. Me too, right? Is she-- Is Pike still being grappled? I'm already raging. Can I reach him? Is he high enough for me to reach? Is he out of my grasp, or I won't know until I get there? Fuck it. I run over in a Frenzied Rage. Whites of the eyes only. And try and just swing over my head. Thank you! Thank god. 19 plus, Jesus. 27? Should I roll all the attacks, or-- The attacks right now, and then roll damage afterwards? 22? And 23. Fuck yeah. I know. Yeah, okay. Jesus, what's 14 plus seven? LAURA AND 29, no, it's-- Yeah, yeah, plus four, 11. And then 18. So 29 plus-- Oh, sorry, 21 plus 18. Somebody keep track of this shit. Right, okay. Two plus-- There's one more 'cause it's three strikes for Frenzied, right? I thought I only did two. Yeah, I only did two. The third one's not great, so-- 21. The second one was-- No, no. It added up to 39. Yeah, I'm sorry. And then, six-- 13 is the last one. 13. Come on, man. Drop some pain. Yeah, totally worth it. What is that plus? 15. Yeah. (scoffs) But a tickle. No one told me he had a lightsaber. Yeah, can you throw me at his side away from his eyeball? If not, it doesn't matter. How many hit points? His eye cancelled out magic. All right. 1d4 + five. Eight. I'll take it. That's eight. That's great. Oh, you rolled for it. I'll take it. Thank you, Scanlan. You're pretty freaking huge. Not that high up. Fuck yes. 22. Yeah, I'm going to grab the black horn. Natural 20. (cheering) Well, I have an Intelligence of six. Watch this. Can I grab and kick off and try and rip it off his head? Or is that all the same thing? I'll try that. At least trying to kick my feet into his eye. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. Do I have to do the Inspiration before I-- And it's ten? It's 16. Okay. All right. Oh shit. 19. Yeah. Nice, Tiberius. Yeah, it might've been. You might've started it. That's good, though. Oh, great, yeah. That's good. I had to grab that thing. 15. 17? Oh, thank god. Five? That's a pissed-off goliath five. (laughs) I am Kerri Strug. 13. Thanks for the Death Ward. (laughs) 13. Death Ward is activated? Fucking done. One, one. Natural 20! (cheering) I can't even look at it. I've been looking down. 18. Okay. I do, but it's not my turn. Or can I take a hit dice at any time? I have to wait for my turn. Oh shit. Why didn't I buy one of those? (laughs) I'm trying not to. I thought the horn was like a party hat. Like you could just yank it off. Wasn't he-- It wasn't even his. He's like-- I thought he was wearing it. The fucker's on there. Way better than one. Where are you? Or get out of his eyesight. Remember, your magic-- Just move to the right. Yeah, thanks. Take it. Thank you, sir. Yes? Am I still prone? Can I stand up? That's my movement to get up? God, son of a bitch. He's looking at me, right? But I'm in the cone of shit? Can I use the Chain of Returning to throw my axe at him? Yeah, 'cause I can't move anywhere, right? I think-- Can I use it-- Can I heal myself after I throw it? Can I? Or is it one or the other? I had to stand up. Let's throw an axe. A one. The Chain of Returning's magic? I was like, just, Chain of Cool. Awesome. Fuck you, meatball! (cheering) She turned to stone? Plus your dex, right? Fuck this! Come on, Clarota, do it for your fellow squid. Yeah, come on, buddy. No, but I got shit in the Bag of Holding. 'Cause I'm a hoarder. Can I get around behind it by going to its left-- Between it and the cage? Can I fit through there? Yeah. Or just to its side, at least? I'll take the side. Ten. Crushing damage does-- nope. How many was it? 14? Seven. Oh, really? Okay, I'd like to take the Greatsword of Frenzy out of the Bag of Holding. Shit, I wanted the bonus action to drink a potion, but fuck it, I'd like to swing at the giant little shit. 17. Oh, 26. 11, 15. No he's-- Telekinesis, is he's-- Oh. Oh, right. Yes. (laughs) Don't tell me what to do. Well, speak for yourself. Death Ward for the win. Yeah, that was a long one. Good job, Matt. Good. Job. First kill. It, well, here. Since we've started here. Can-- I'm still being grappled by whatever's in that cage. Did you even tell us what's in the cage, since we never even looked? No, he won't tell me! My ears are like, 102 degrees. That's amazing. I need a drink. This is where you need a neighborhood bar. Where we can go and, like-- Go, just, what the fuck just happened? I will have a frequent member pass there. Those parodies are pretty funny. Glad we didn't die during your hard week. Well. I died. It's going to be his. Find me on Twitter. Let's talk about that. I'm Roy Mustang. (laughter) So the girls. Word. Yes, hear hear. Oh, it's Becca. I don't know if we handled it well. We came, we saw, we didn't die permanently. No, I don't want it. It's gone. I don't even have my fucking axe, man. Erika and Hector!
