Oh really? Doesn't even look yellowed or anything. Oh good. (laughter) Damn! Man, I don't know if that was Dr. Seuss or Lin-Manuel but that was great. You're shirt-cocking your own mouth! The dice got restocked. Britney Spears, NSYNC-- Why are you laughing? Why'd you laugh? You better get your shit in gear. I mean, let's be clear, what are we really going to hide from? Look where his fucking head is. He's like the sun. We ain't hiding from that shit. I just want to pee on myself and run. 14. Oh wait, you ask them, in order. Were we supposed to have a Heroes' Feast? I'm so glad, I was totally here last week. What do you see? No, it is! Stay positive! That's a good sign. Does he question his choices in life? Scatter. Please hit his face. Please hit his face. Please hit his face. Shit hammer. Yeah, I see Gilmore take off running, and being there's a giant T-Rex on the map, I'm going to go, "Must go faster, must go faster--" And I would like to run as fast as balls this way towards this cover as far as I can for 50 feet. Oh! Glad I joined Gilmore! The Ancient Dragon? We'll take the damage reduction. 17. Tell me he has only one of those per day. Did somebody get temporary hit points? Right, well I'm going to add them now. Oh, thank you, that's much better. Well, being that my run was so rudely interrupted by shit-chest over there, can I change course seeing that he's going to barf fire at all of us and run straight at him in a rage? Yeah, can we go ahead and see how we do here, and I will go Reckless Attack, Great Weapon Master. Yeah, I mean, let's buy the ticket and take the train, right? Who fucking knows. One! Better. 19. Shit. Roll better. That's better. That is a 25. Reckless and Great Weapon. Yeah, I'm going frenzied! 21. I do. 25. So somewhere between 21 and 25. Which one is the d12? This one. 11. Two points of necrotic and 36 total. Yeah! Yeah! Fuck. That ends my turn. 2d20 of damage. Damn, girl. 32 to hit? Yeah. I took like 40 points of damage. Yep, thank you. I was confused. You should have said that first and we'd all go, yay! Yeah, test your might. Oh no, please don't! (sobs) It hits. Yeah, it's good. 38? No, that was Lady Kima's voice. (laughter) Yup. I saw that hentai. Or just any dice. (whispered) Yes. (weakly) Yeah. Woohoo! 14 points. 194. I think I have advantage on those, (singing) because I got Danger Sense! Natural 20. Yeah, yeah. Reckless and Great Weapon Master. Eight and that's a natural 20. 19, 20, plus ten is 30 points of damage, including the one point of necrotic, and then I double that? Double all the dice. Right so, 60. Oh, sorry. Okay. 12, so 25, 35, 37. Thanks. Two points necrotic. Yeah. Yeah, if it's a reaction I'm not quite sure. That could have been better. There's some shit going down on this map. Yes? (giggles) Now, who's going first this time? Ah, you want to know what I'm going to do, do you? Intimidated by my presence, eh? Whack the Titanstone Knuckles! Yeah, yeah. I now come up to his ankle bone. Life is a thrill. Can I use my full-- oh, he's far away. Shit. Balls and ass. I would like to run straight forward and then veer off to this side, I'm flanking him. Yeah. Great. Am I now within striking range? I would like to make all three attack Great Weapon Master, Reckless! 12, oh, so close. Damn it, covering up the wrong page. That's, damn it, 19. (Scottish accent) Great. That's better. That is a 26. Good. 27 minus five is 22. I got to get rid of that fucking Great Weapon Master, that thing's killing me. Hey, that's a six! Six points of necrotic for a total of 36 points of damage. 'Ello, poppet. Sect? Oh, insect. Yeah, that's my turn. The fire breath does not recharge? On me? I'm trying to keep him warm! Like, I'm trying to give him a little touch, little feel, let him know that we love him. Yeah, that's right. I think that'll hit. There's three. There's one more. (singing) Happy trails to... shit. Cool. Was there no fire damage on the second one? Legendary? Did he do his legendary thingy? Or he just made it? Can we bring all the alcohol on set right now? Yeah, move around me, bitch. I'm going to get my insults in while I'm still breathing. Six. Pretty much anywhere. Those faces are-- wow! Time to get crunk. After we're all dead, he'll get very sick. Let's reason with him! You can die now, wait for later-- "Why does it burn when I pee?" This is against me. Almost double my AC. Not much longer. That's amazing! Nice! All the d8s. (laughing) I'd like to drink a potion. At least it didn't point and laugh at you. He used your full first name. I'm saying Kima's not actually attached to a human being, just saying. I totally love Kima, I got nothing against her. Just looking out for myself right now. Yeah, okay, come on. All right. I'll remember this later. It's in the rules. Yeah, it hits. Crazy motherfucker. Nothing yet? On my turn. (singing) Eat the little pterodactyl. I have advantage because of-- 17. Okay. Off of me? What was that? "Focus on the dragon."TRAVIS,  There you go!, MARISHA, MARISHA Wilhelm scream! MARISHA, All right, fair enough. (laughs) Because he rolled not very good. Crossbow? Come on, buddy. Boom! Nobody else is excited about this? 7th-level Disintegrate. Now y'all are excited! I'm with you, Gilmore, I'm a true fan, OG! The skin's grown over it. Would you like to go first? Yeah, he ate too much, he can't get up in the air! You just hit Grog. He does not appreciate that. One little bump of that table, and it's falling down. I really don't want that to fall. It's going to break. All right. Come on, come on, Gil. Yes. Even better! 21. That was a 19. I took the 51. Wait, Gilmore is down, and is unconscious? How high is Thordak in the air? Sam. What are you going to do? Okay. Is somebody planning to go into the fucking tunnel, on the earring? Because I can't hit him. He's too high. But wasn't there a tunnel that we wanted? I attach the Bloodaxe to the Chain of Returning and I throw it at his feet. Let me move 20 feet to his right rear, over here. Just in case he decides to do the Cone of Fuck Everything again. (laughter) Reckless! 29. Hey, that's a 12, that's great. Sorry, I'm blanking out. 25, 27, plus the 1d4 because I'm enlarged, which I didn't do last time. That's 30. And I need to roll a DC of 14 to bring it back in, but it's strength. That's too wild. That's off the wall. That's a 12. That's off the wall. God, nipples on a horse! Wait, do I have advantage? Strength. Advantage on strength checks, strength saves. 19. I did. It's that little tiny one. Ooh! Is the Second Wind a bonus action? Second Wind, the fighter thing? Can I do that? 1d10 plus fighter level, which is one. Nine. Ten! Ten hit points. He's in the middle of the motherfucking sky. It's okay! Yes! Oh. Not your natural 20. And you are on fire. Yeah. Bigby's Hand is? Like a fucking puppy. That's great! How's that Vestige treating you? (singing) Girl, get your breath back. Halitosis is a bitch. I will fucking-- I will pop all your knuckles. Tidal Wave. Thanks, Keyleth. (laughter) Get your shit together, man. Spice? We'll remember this. Your annual review's coming up. Oh God. I'm going first. Because it's so insignificant. I'm going to attach the Bloodaxe to the Chain of Returning and throw it at his foot. I thought we didn't care about the hole? Grog loves going in holes. All right, I throw the Bloodaxe. Reckless! Yeah, that's not going to happen. 31. It's not Great Weapon Master. That's a 12. That's good. Two points of necrotic for 27 and I'm enlarged! And that's another one. Hey, matzoh ball in your face. And then I've got to pull it back. Seven plus 14, woo! Got it. No I can't, I can only throw it once. I don't have another attack. It takes my whole action. I get two attacks in an action. I never finished my turn, so can I use my movement now? Since we're on the same, can I chase him back to where he landed? 50 feet and how far does that get me? Nah. Nah. Actually, my bonus action is still there and I am frenzied. Can I attack? I'll do it Reckless. 29? Yeah, not Great Weapon Master. Nine plus two, 26, 29. 29. That does. There is no tomorrow. There's a giant fucking dragon and a fire giant. 100d100s. And the universe implodes. Oh shit! I do! Has his AC changed with his different size? You don't know? Reckless, Great Weapon Master. Natural 20. Yeah, on the first roll. I also have brutal critical which at thirteenth level, you roll two additional damage dice. 28. So I double that? Right. So that's 16 doubled, 32. So then, that's an 11. So 47. 45. I don't know why we're wasting that on Jarett. I mean, he had a great accent, but fuck. You remember the cryptkeeper? Jarett's going to those auditions tomorrow. Yeah. Whether he wants to be when he sees a mirror... Yeah, you could play the fucking flute. 11. Who are you talking to right now? Oh, yes? I would like to stand up. How high is Thordak? Son of a bitch on a stick. Could I just attach the bloodaxe and throw it at his much smaller foot, now? Yeah, but I can only jump 20 feet in the air. 15 feet in the air. He's 40 feet in the air. These hieroglyphs seem to indicate that he's too high. Yeah, 'cause I'm only like 14 feet high, right? I'm reckless throwing the bushwhacker. Ten. (counting) 34, 37, 38. 38 points of damage. With my movement, can I run nuts towards where the fire giant is? That'll work. I need a new plaything that'll actually stay. We don't care about the tunnel, huh? (laughter) We don't even know it's happened, though, yet! It's all underground! There's a big fire giant. Open him up! Yeah, get it! Boom! Head out of ass. That's such a mistake. That hits. So halved to, math? Thank you. I will use my Retaliation. The old chin turned back. Reckless. Great Weapon Master. That's better. 21. Nice. 21, that was crap. And 22. Both ones. 22 plus ten is 32. Taco Bell logic right there. Yep. Mad d8's. Oh, he's stroking out. Flirted with the edge. (gasps) Oh. I will hold my reaction. No. What? We literally have no power over them. Not me, I'm putting out that last fire on the map. Trinity. I want to kill all the things that are alive. Yeah. Great Weapon Master, Reckless. Eight, 15, 19. 16. 22. Ooh! 26. 36. For the first hit. Yay! Is the lizard man left? Can I give him the option to run? Nah, fuck that. I kill him, too. Hey! Oh, cool. Yeah, I do this. You're at a crossroads, bro. Crossroads. The shitter. Oh shit. Don't you want to see what happens? She's reading that scroll, man. Did she ask her questions of Thordak? He said it looked very similar. Do it, Tiny Toon! Oh, I didn't say I was leaving. No, there's a lizardfolk right there. I want to see how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop. I reach out and go like (head crushing sound). I have advantage on those. (laughter) Can't hear you, can't hear you. (laughter) Oh, no. That's the show, folks. All right. Well. Anybody see that? Who's here? Kima's there, right? Ha, fuck Bigby's Hand. Smooth, right? Let's join everybody else. Should anybody stay out here in case she wants to come back out? You want me to stay out? That's 130-something total points. What was that called, those four flaming rocks? Is that a spell? What level is that? She didn't get to ask any of the questions? I like that idea. Talks Machina next week?
