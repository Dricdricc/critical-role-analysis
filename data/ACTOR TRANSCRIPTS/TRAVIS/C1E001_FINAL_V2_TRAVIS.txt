I don't know what that means, a bottleneck. Oh! Hi. I'm Travis Willingham, voice actor, gamer. I play Grog the goliath barbarian. Yeah. I think we all are. Son of a bitch. Next time he dies. We're in, right? Oh! We're all jacked up from before, right? That sounds fine with me. Was that a wink? Drinking territory. Yes! Oh right, am I like--? What're you looking at? My kind of people, see you later! I go grab the drink with the lovely dwarves. I would like a cask of ale. Cask. Cask of ale. Cask. Yeah. Keep going. Looks good. Total? I was told there would be no math. Yeah, what is with the scar? I've got one myself. Yeah! More drinking! Is there a champion of the circle of fighting in the tavern? Is there a reigning-- Well, I have to know these things! My type of dwarf. Maybe we'll can use him as a merc later or something. All right, another time then. Does it rain down here? Yeah, you want to stay away from those miners Scanlan, that's a dirty business. We're going there! Oh! Roll it! You're the first one. Like stealth, you mean? Why don't we get old Drunky Greybeard that's got his face down on the bar to do it? Me? Yeah, but I'm really-- oh, that's true. Maybe I'll part my armor, so he can see the scar. Post up on the bar. All right. I would like to get the largest goblet you have of ale, and I would like to go over to, what was his name? Bulbous? I had it right. Balgus. I would like to-- Yes. I would like to go up and put my scar, and post up on the bar and (throat clearing) (louder throat clearing) He likes him drunk, so maybe like, half. I'm sorry to disturb you, your name is of great repute around these parts. We were wondering if we might, perchance, acquire your knowledge about town, for a bit of a search. Right, I hear you're a good fighter. You look strong. Right. How often do you get challengers in this tavern? Right. I have an intelligence of six, I know what I'm doing. There is a very pretty lady over there, with slightly pointy ears. (whispering) I'm talking about you or you. (normal volume) There's two of them! They were actually wanting to ask you a question if you wouldn't mind. Me?! Because I was either going to fight him or I was going to throw boobs at him, and I went with boobs. Look at that one. 19! Nice form. Because I told him to. Because you're supposed to ask him-- We're all going to die. We've got a bunch of dragon pieces. We've got 37 dragon teeth, one dragon eye, four cups of dragon blood-- It gets better with age. Have you ever done that? I put it in the bag of holding. What?! He came out! No, we actually got rid of the troll dick. I offered it up, but by that time it had turned into a slimy-- We got to sleep. Let's be honest, that gate's going to jack us up. It's going to be full of trouble. Let's sleep. Yeah, go ahead, okay. What? The fuck does that mean? But first, whores in the bedroom! We need a massage. On my crotch. The Stone's Pillow? I love it. A bargain. I'll take the tallest one. Thank you! I like it already. Oh god. Wow! Pretty decent, good for you. Hang strong, buddy! That's okay! Uh-oh. Saving throw? Yep! No lightning attacks! What're you two doing? TALIESIN and Bowl that Fireball, dude! That was wonderful, I don't know about you! I come down too. It's party time! Do it! Fuck that bear up! Good! I got my money on Ballsack! Yeah, we're watching what they're doing. Come on taint butter, you got it. That'll work. Of course. Why don't you go change out of bear form? We did say three more. He's tough. You put some stank on him. He's going to be playmates with me. I mean, are there like stables? Yeah, he's a bear, he's fine. (as Trinket) Yeah, I'm fine. Right, listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life combat, women, and ale! [record scratch] We're going to beat up everybody, right? Brunch? How you almost got killed? Did you sleep? Oh. I had to make sure, you know. Do we need to do something with the comment cards? No, I did! I know, like, three letters, so like A, F, and A. I covered my hand in ink. Does the light ever change being underground? Yes! You did? Oh, you did do that, you did take it as a troll. That's where the troll dick came from. We can take them. I had a lot of breakfast. Tiberius Kraghammer. It's a good name. No handle? Percy? That's awesome! Who cares? Light it up! He's gone nuts! Who's talking right now? Drop a deuce in the bedroom! Do it. That we do not have our healer, at present. To the mines, then, yeah. Let's go where the guards are. Dwarf Sigma Sigma. Yeah, do your thing-- fuck these dwarves up. Right? It's the shit. I am assuming he had a goblet on the table. What? Yeah, we are here to right wrongs and right lefts. Shit. Balls. Ass. Yes! Take it! Copy that. 18, too. Yeah, buddy. Yeah, those are mine. Get after it, big man! Roll crappier, ogres! What?! Ladies first. Dang! Come on now! (sings) Natural 20! On an insight check. Recites poetry. Something behind the ogres. It's like playing croquet at this point, so yes. (laughter) I would like to rage! And I would like to move to the right of all those stinking goblins! Yeah, a little more to the right. Yeah, a little more. Yeah, keep going. All the way flanking it there. Yeah. Yeah, and then I would like to give them the cleanest shave possible with my greataxe. 18 plus eight. That's 26? Oh, damage, crap. Two plus the four. 13! Oh, that was cute. 21! Oh, that was eight plus seven is 15! Double prizes! Yeah! Oh, put it on him brother! I bring out my blade. Hundreds. What's in the middle? Are those fires? The entanglement? Are there any dwarves that we can say to go get Ballsack and bring him down? Thought you were going to have a little-- What the fuck is that? Oh shit! Roll high, roll high. Holy shit, Tiberius. Ladies first. Right, I would like to run around the other side of the rock, raging, spit flying out my of my mouth! I would like to use the chain of returning, also crafted by Tiberius, attach it to the end of the greataxe, and throw it from where I am at the snake. Eight, nine, 17! All right, nice. That is 15. This says, "An athletics-strength check is required to pull the weapon free, the DC 12?" 12. Oh, a d20. Shit. Balls. Taint. Five. Plus what? Oh! That's bound to be good. Seven! It's 12! (elated laughter) (nervous laughter) Meant to do that! Meant to do that of course. Yeah, come on! What is this bullshit? Are you okay? Damn! Away. (laughter) If you kill, I will take a shit on this table. Never killed anything in two years! Well done, Scanlan, well done!
