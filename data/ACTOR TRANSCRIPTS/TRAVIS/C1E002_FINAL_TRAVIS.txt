Yeah, you did! You promise? Bloodier, ale. Beerwine. It was really good. Yep, we did. You're an eagle. Will we get paid for the monsters and creatures we've already slayed? Oh. I forgot you did that. Roll good, it's the first one. Aye! Huzzah! What do you know of a Ballsac up in the tavern? Do I have that right? We don't naturally heal up? I appreciate the slow jam. R. Kelly would agree. (Matt laughs) Our hero is right over here. Fearsome Scanlan. We're goin' in the hole. Do any of the beasts go back into them? Before we go-- What do you use for the-- He had parents. Let's go get drunk and go to sleep then. Look at the time. We're lying, right? Good. Back to the tavern. Or did you have something? If we're underground-- It's summer. There you go. Where do we item up? Do we get potions and stuff somewhere? Like plant stuff or potion stuff? So, magic stuffs. Better question. Thank you, Hieris thank you. Oh, gotta go, sorry. Oh, I put my head back in the door, and I throw him a turkey leg and a beef jerky stick. I gotta get rid of this stuff. It's been in here for years. We gotta lotta shit in this bag. I didn't say it was good. I just want it out. It's really tender. Yeah, those are the best parts. I gave him a turkey leg. What, it was a burp! (group laughs) Much worse from the other end, I guarantee. She rolled a one. Good. So we just walk up and-- I have one job. To take damage. Electrified sound effect. Should've let me go. We have a flying carpet. It's really not that bad. What? Oh, the magic carpet, hold on. You wanna fly it up to the door? I said you, not me. That's what I said. Do you wanna tie a rope around your waist in case it goes bad? No, do it. Oh my God, really? What what, you turned invisible and walked inside a house last time. What kind, like a buddy? Feet touching the ground? I'm just sitting back here holding the carpet. ♫ I can show you the world ♫ (group laughs) He's coming towards us? Say something! God, what is with these rolls? Oh Tiberius, can't you become a dwarf? And jump behind me, and act like you just-- (whispering) What's your dwarf name? Keyleth Kraghammer. I'm gonna choke on a chip. (coughs) (high-pitched voice) Oh, hello! My cornhole friends. That's a very Disney moment. It's a powerful wink. Yeah, apparently not. Oh hello! That was fun. Vulva? If you want to visit the House of Vulva, you and I can go later but not now. Women, fighting, ale, that's my job. Awesome. So we got like 24,000 gold pieces? 23 thousand. 22 thousand? Math is stupid. Are you sure you don't wanna think about renaming it now? Nag champa. Oh sh-- Are you guys that old? Yep, yep. Level three for this one, please. Two. Yeah, superior. Fuck! Really?! I take damage fast. Oh, here we go. (Liam and Taliesin laugh) Everybody take five while we haggle. You got it. How much are they each, 1500? I'll take one for me, thank you. Oh shit. I just paid for-- He's an old elf. Oh, we have a lot of dragon bits. What about basilisk eggs? We have also, if you're interested in trade, basilisk eggs and parts of an umber hulk. No, that's gone. (group laughs) It was used very well. I'm a collector of sorts. I need like three of those. Yeah, three. Well let's do the potions first. Keyleth. Tiberius? Tiberius? Scanlan? Vax? Oh, my intelligence is six. So nine. Nine times 300, work that out. I believe it's 2700 gold pieces? It's Professor Grog, actually. Scanlan, underwater breathing or air, oxygen supplies? Ask with your fancy talk. We'll take it. We got all this platinum I forgot about. He can't hear-- Yeah. Just one? We'll take two. Yep. Show-off. You couldn't buy it for me? Could go on my pinky or something. That's an important nut. Thank you, you're very nice. And it smells pretty in here. Do we sleep before we get to go kill shit? Well can we go do that? Yeah! You clever fucker. Is Ballsack in there? When we walk in? He's not? Really? Yeah, but doesn't mean he have to go to it. Rock that shit, Perce. Nah, let's sleep. Oh, they're still tired from the other night. I don't know what this is. Oh, it's you getting the elbow drop. Oh yeah! (crosstalk) So we head down to the mines. To the hole. ♫ Takin' it to the hole ♫ Yep. Are they especially bowing to Scanlan the snake slayer? No love! They can't see that. It's a boot. Make an arcane check. Somebody with arcane. Be specific. Like a portal or a prison or a-- Well hers is a lot better. Air high five. Make 10. You should put it under the thing. It's kinda crap, but it's kinda great. I love it. There you go. Are you claustrophobic? Yeah, it's what you do. You're gonna roll crap. You're gonna roll crap. Yeah, let's go there. It's a fucking trip, right? Can we ask one of the guards? Nice! I cup my hands over my face and go, Grog, Grog, Grog. (laughs) Why not? What? Is there any residue? Oh crap, fire.TRAVIS,  Yeah., TALIESIN, TALIESIN We go further. We got a ton. Let me touch you. He rolled, he rolled something. Hey Scanlan, you kill me, I kill you. Quick, quick break. Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two-- [audio resets] Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life combat, women, and ale. (record scratching) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things. Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this, this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches. Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale. Yeah! So thank you for that. Big round of applause. Or crab. That would be better. Is the light coming from over the water? Okay. What did you do that for? They're spiders. Oh fuck. Oh God. Waterfall is where on that map? Got it. Those look like umber hulks. I have their claws still. Shit! They responded to something. Oh shit. That hits. Do their eyes do something? (laughs) No motherfucker, miss. 18. (group cheers) That hits. Misses. Okay. Ball sack. There you go. A little redemption. Ah, yeah. I'm 14. Tiberius and I are 13-14. It's the ghost pepper cookies. I knew it. I fell out a fucking 120 foot hole. Maybe he'll ask you to make some cookies. Aw, fuck. Come on, Perce. Get after it, nasty! Damn it! Minxie. Misses. Give me another four. 20 hits. I have a half damage to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage? So I'm not raging?! But I'm so angry. 18 points. It's all right, it's okay. My turn's coming. The reach around? Yeah! Now I'm angry. I would like to rage, and not only rage, I would like to go into a frenzied rage. For three full attacks. While I'm raging so hard, that I pop all the capillaries in my eyeballs, so I can't really see that well. And I just swing a lot. Oh, shit! Don't check, look, I'm rolling. (Marisha and Laura laugh) 30. I gain one level of exhaustion with a rage hit. I got that big, like, nasty thing. Is that a 20? 11. Five. A one! (group cheers) It's my turn? Oh, that's my turn. I did. I didn't hurt anybody yet. He can do whatever. She's also being controlled. Save me, save me. Use your laser pointer, dude. That's some Hawkeye stuff. She dropped it, but it was a good roll. Oh my God. Can you do that?! What?! Yeah, the jam. You've gotta get it better. Come on, cave bear. Why have you not been a rhinoceros yet? Yeah, you do. You threw him forever. Yeah, it was pretty good. Am I? (grunts) With my frenzied rage renewed, I run towards the water, haunted by nightmares of Sebastian in the Little Mermaid, and I leap into the water and start slashing and slashing. ♫ Le poisson, le poisson, hee hee hee, fuck you bitch ♫ (Matt laughs) Okay, good. Second attack. 26. Okay. 25. Good. It's all about sushi right? Eight, second one is 16. And 17, thirty. What's 24 plus 10? LAURA AND Come on, drop this thing. Yeah. Sick, nasty. Finish him. Finish him. Cause you're having to avert your gaze. You're trying to work out this whole thing where you're all basically at a severe disadvantage fighting this thing, unless you want to be completely fucked over. All right. We have two of its eyes. I run over and shove the umber hulk off of Scanlan. You should get in the water and clean yourself off. As a badge of honor? Gross. Let's go towards the light. No, I run. No, running. I'm frenzy raging. It's a bright, shiny thing. I'm going there! Aww. I start hacking away at the bedding. Just chopping the shit out of it. Somebody likes their bedding apparently. It was 3000 count Egyptian. Right. (grunts) It's the brain bug from Starship Troopers. Are they on the same level as us? You saunter? Yeah. Right. Who's screaming? No, I'm not screaming. What's all this stealthing? Where's all the killing? Ass cloud. I'm slightly aroused. (group laughs) I'm drawn to the smell. Outstanding. It's a black light. Whoa! Can you do that? We got two of 'em. What they were? Yeah, yeah. What, has no nostrils? On my professor-torial mind. Oh good, my modifier's negative 2, so yippee-kye-ay-eh. Six. Like Kenny G music coming through my brain. Ah! But I was at six! I turn into a turnip? It's like when I tried to read 50 Shades of Grey. (groans) Who's the master? Let 'em run back to the master and we'll track 'em. ♫ If I only had a brain ♫ A dirty mafia check? Just breathe it in. 22! Puke on him. Oh, I got it. (blows raspberry) That's-- come on. That was a very good Klingon translation. What?! I'm Vanilla Sky right now. Zac, do you have any renew intelligence potions on you, by chance? Yeah. Shit. Some tunes. Dropping some dope beats.
