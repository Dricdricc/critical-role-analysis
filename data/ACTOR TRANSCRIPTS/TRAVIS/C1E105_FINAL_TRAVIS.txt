We're totally recording. I'm so glad that's available on the BBC. What do you mean, finally? They do that every week. Yeah, nice job with the words and stuff. BC... E. Yeah, it's Friday evening, 730. In fact, we got an even bigger theatre this year. The last theatre had 1,500 seats, we're like, oh, we'll never get that many people, and it went (explosion sound). It filled up, so we got a 2,500 seat theatre. It's massive, it's a huge party, if you didn't join us last year, you want to come to this mayhem. It's so much fun. You don't need passes to GenCon, by the way, you don't have to have a badge or anything for that, it's a standalone thing. There are definitely tickets still available, it's going to be super fun. It's a great idea! Eat all of the fruit. It was really good. It was just fruit, by the way. Like I said. Are there any other gods here that we should curry favor with? For? Of? Did we? Yeah, what would we like to do? Yeah. No effects from eating that fruit, right? Didn't remove a curse or anything? I could do it, too. Five. Five stones of power. Are we going underground? Are you the leader of all the people? Is that a yes or a no? You don't have to fucking brag. Oh my god, can we eat food? (laughter) Yeah. This got so much better all of a sudden. We never travel traditionally anymore. I'm just saying, I miss the romantic aspects of traveling the countryside. It's like fast forward, immediate gratification, fucking you know. Why are you fucking talking to me like I'm a child? Okay. That would-- okay. (laughter) Yeah? Yeah. I dig that. Oh, hey. Don't get after my camping partner like that, all right? Shit. Chill. No marshmallows for this witch. Could I attune, either before I go to sleep or when I wake up, to the Dwarven Thrower instead of the Bloodaxe? Thank you, chat. Yeah, they know where your shit is. "It's in the page in front of your blue divider." We didn't want to bring any extra muscle with us, do we, from these peeps? Oh wait, we're misting a long ways away. Never mind. Sorry. Forget it. See! High five! Up top. His hand's cold. Write it out, bitch! A. As. Good message. That's a big word at the front. What! Yeah! Are we misting? Pools of Wittebak. Because that was a one. Like a normal person-sized dwelling? Natural 20! Okay. Wait. Before we do, there are no random nudist giants that have run over in this area, right? There's nobody sees us over here taking off? Not particularly. Well, yeah, have you ever seen a giant naked? You'll never forget it. Yeah! I mean, it's a tiny house, I don't really want to go in there. I like having exits I fit through. Yeah, I'll just knock the house down from the outside. I'll stay outside. I'll stay out here. No nude giants, right? The key. I'm outside the house. That would be have been donesies. Willkommen. That's some Predator shit! How the fuck do I get in that damn door? Are you lying? Can I do an insight check on Percy? 19. I roll in on all fours. I'm waiting for it to kick in. I reach in the Bag of Holding. I take out Percy's glasses. Would you care for a pair of these testicl-- spectacles? But that's not fucking power. I do. I have these Bracers of Defense. (softly) Shit. Fuck. Powerful. Well, I do have one thing that seems to be pretty powerful. I pull out of the Bag of Holding a small leather case. I open the flap. I don't know if you have any interest in this, but my experience with these items has been very extreme. Would you care to take a card? No, you can pick a card. Yeah, sure. I mean, Percy, do you have a book out of all of these that you want to read? Yeah, that sounds perfect to me. Vecna. It's all right, he can't die. It's cool. We're all right. Oh, he actually made it upstairs? 22. Me? Oh? Can I go into a rage? And he fell where? Can I run over to Sprigg and shove a-- should I shove a health potion in his throat? Right. I'll run upstairs to see where Percy went. Do you mind? Yeah. (rage noises) Reckless! Not Great Weapon Master. Two-handed with the Dwarven Thrower. That's a lot. 30, minus-- oh, there is no minus. 32. 31. So they're not giants. So I just roll a d10. That's a ten. Rage damage. 25. On the first one. Second one. Yeah. Black tendrils? Okay, cool. That's my turn. Those are constitution saving throws? Misses. That does hit. The necromancer is? Way to be energy-conscious with those LEDs! -- a bitch? If you napalm the forest, the trees will probably catch fire. Or do you want to be more over yonder? Is she doing it against Copperfield? Is David Blaine with them? Thanks, Keyleth. You beat me by one second! That guy's still up there with us, right? Can I smash my Titanstone Knuckles together and cast Enlarge on myself? I'm hoping the floor gives. Because he had barely any left. The guy in Manners, he fell too, right? Beautiful. Can I take Tweedledee to my right and make two reckless attacks against him? They're not giants, right? They're considered undead. 30 to hit. And the second one. 29. So ten. 24 points. Plus the Enlarge-- 25. 22 with the second one. Wow. Cool. Good to know. That's interesting. I'm going to go into a frenzied rage as my bonus action. 17. (screaming) He's missing an eye. His depth perception sucks. Can I kill the guy on the floor? Can he be mine, please? Can I please smash him? The guy that's lying on the floor in the house, please? I haven't Gallaghered anybody in a while. I skip on in and (gibberish yell). I don't mean to ask the obvious question, but how did he know we were here? Sprigg. You said this place was a prison. Did you mean that? Could you leave? If you wanted. Oh. Sorry about the prison, then. Yep. Yes. That is indeed what I was hoping for. But why? There's no separation between the first and the second floor. I'm in my space. Yeah? Not a problem! (grunting) Keyleth, catch! I thought you were on fire. I'm really sorry. (whistles) Your stomach is glowing. Aw, man! You did? You knew that the moment you saw him? I'm not interested in the fucking books. I'm as uncomfortable as I can possibly be. This is the worst-case scenario of my entire life. I'm not moving and hoping this is all over soon. It's just endless books, beyond what you can see! Are there chairs? There are chairs? I don't know. Do you? I want to leave. Fast. Okay. Let's go. I bet not. These are really tall books. What did you find? The way out? Exit? Really? Do we have to get you gifts? I would love to know.
