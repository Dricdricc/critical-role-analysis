It was actually up to me to remember, and I didn't. She was closest to home. I'll be the caboose. Can I touch the ground, now that we're in the titan? I'm thinking maybe this might be where the Knuckles are from. Can I touch it and see if the oven mitts do anything? I reach up and touch my Adam's apple and (vibrating) this place is crazy. Sorry. No, you wouldn't do it? I thought you would. Why are you even looking over here? I know stick figures. I know charades. I can read Dwarven because of the belt. Yeah, I might fuck up the bigger pieces. Baa-ram-ewe. Babe, anyone? Du. Du hast. Du hast mich. (laughter) It looks like a warning of some kind. Right, it says, "Leaves, death here, no further." So leaves, death here, leaves of death here, but no further. I'm still working it out. I've been working really hard. That was five minutes of the most concentration I've ever given to one thing in my life. Thanks. But they're probably in inoperable pieces. If we're inside the GI tract of this titan and we give it an Earthquake, is it basically like a big old dead titan fart? True. Natural 20. Gil coming in in the clutch! I go over and I start-- boulders, dirt, everything. 41? It seems new to me every time. Have you ever transmuted anything before? I know aquariums that don't look that good. (robotically) The walk sign is on. Same thing. I would like to rage. I would like to spin around 180 degrees, and I would like to attack Clayface right about there. Shit Stain is down at the bottom of the stairs. Reckless! 28. Okay. Oh, I reroll ones and twos. Nice! 22 plus one point of necrotic. 23 points of damage. I do it again! Reckless, Great Weapon Master this time! 25. 31 points of damage. Is he holding my axe? Well, I wanted to move! I'm moving! I would like to go (counting) 30 feet to face off with this guy. I have a low AC. I don't wear clothes. I wear gauntlets and stuff. I wear skin. And tattoos. Okay. (laughter) Pulled that shit out at the last minute. You'd better. They're going to come out asking for help, because they've been-- And we're slaughtering them! We weren't going to even say anything or do anything to you guys! Mythcarver gets you some action once every two years. You never know, that guy could be made out of concrete. Well, not this guy, they're still walking. Oh, bring it. They both hit. They're reckless. Six. Can I take my retaliation strike against him? Lovely. Reckless, Great Weapon Master. Come on. Natural 20! Oh! I reroll ones and twos! Great. 11, that's better. 36, 42-- 48. Oh, necrotic. 52. I've been practicing. So if they're healing when we hit them, do we think they're healing when they go back into the wall? Dude, that is a badass. Thanks, Keyleth. I know, that's what I'm doing. So there's no enemies in sight? Ah! Can I run as far as I can this way? Is that like five, ten, 15, 20-- I'll take it. Yep. I'm going to hold my attack until something stupid shows me its face. (singing) I believe I can-- Fly? (singing) I believe I can touch-- (speaking) What does he touch? The sky. (singing) I think about it every-- I'm never singing in character. (singing) I know just what you're saying! You going to Time Cop that shit? Don't you talk to her like that! Yeah. By the way, we're supposed to go to the left. What's right? The left? Five points of bludgeoning damage. And if you attack, your Invisibility drops. You've got an invisible woman mini! That is rad. Deuces wild. Oh shit. Danger sense! 15. Oh! It's too late for that. 18. You are most gracious. I've got to ask, when the creepy rock guy popped up near me, is he within my held action? Fair enough. I just stare at him. He's a little drunk. He's got that Soulja lean going on. With that dice? With such dedication! I want that PowerBall winnings. Because you're a siege monster! (answering grunts) It sounds like a concrete mixer. That's why mine didn't happen, either. (makes weird noise) (grunts) Can I run over to the thing-- It's just a pound of earth, right? I don't hear anything, or see any fur or claws? Fuck that shit! I reckless, Great Weapon Master attack old Boney Face! Oh, that's terrible. That's better! Thank god for reckless! Sorry, 30 minus five, 25! Yes! 33, plus the necrotic damage. Second attack. 26. 28. No, 38! Should I run down this tunnel and see what's down here? Yeah? Can I see him from wherever I am? This enemy? I'll run up and join Percy. Nice. It gets to act first. I thought that went in the coffee. Pikey! I can't see anything because a person's in the way. Untamed monster! They're everywhere. (laughs) No! (Laura voice) Is this favored terrain? Do we see the inside of the gazebo-type structure? Colored glass? I'm with you. I think this thing has a yield. But how many times can she do that in a day? Is that a pull the trigger and once? Do we want to waste it on something-- Okay. I mean it could be an undead-- Might just be a dwarven king. Or he's totally encased by the material and if we unearth him-- Yep. Let sleeping dogs lie? Yeah, let's do this! Go check that door before I do. What are we fucking pretending like-- Oh, hold on, hold on. There are runes, of which I can read. Don't knock it, all right, just be grateful. Can I try to take a look at the Dwarvish? Yeah! I'm Professor X. Shit, okay, all right. It's been worth the wait. It is the last king, there's like a secret buried with him and his death brought on the madness. So like, there's definitely treasure with him down there. He's the last king, there's like, the secret with-- Nope. Thank you. I'm working real hard. When they're gone, they're gone. What do you think, should we dig him up, or move on? It says he has a secret with him. Right? Like a secret? A prize? Oh yeah, a "'stow' of our mountain secrets." And I walk up and fucking hammer that shit. Yeah. Double damage! 17. Ten! Fee fi fo fum! That is a 15. I'll make a perception check too. I'm at the doorway. Should we clear out of here while you work on this bomb? We're all going to get out of the chamber. Five of them, on pedestals. You are not doing this to us! Look at his eyes! Look at his eyes! Aw, shit! Yeah. Do it. No, no, no, do it! Yeah! Look at that face. We need a key though. We need a key. Let me try my-- It's like we kept asking for it. Whoa. Shit, we just blew those. We're not in there. It really didn't go that poorly last time. That was a lot of action. What did you get? Gimme. Is it a two-handed weapon? Single-handed? I'm just saying. My Dwarven Thrower? It can be single or double-handed. It's not a warhammer. It flies back to my hand, though. It is. But you can never have enough hammers. Do you mind if I--? Are you kidding me? I'm like a fucking Home Depot of weapons. I got what you need. Just because I want to know, can I go up to the doorway and hit the side of the doorway with the adamantine black hammer? Yeah, without attuning. I just hit the doorway. It's solid. It's hefty. It's one of the better hammers I've ever wielded. No. Bag of Holding. All right. Let's go back to the other way. Yeah, do it. Absolutely you would. Yep. That's exactly what you would do with it. We travel back down the--- Vax. Go fetch. The damn growl. I thought it was a growl. LAURA and Nobody that eats with their hands in the inside of a titan is nice. I've been freed from my-- All we know is you're just out there. No book? Vax. What did you find up ahead? All right. We join him. Okay, that's fucking clutch. Because he's enjoying his belt, can I take out-- Could I take out the black metallic hammer now that he's all excited about his belt and begin my attuning period? Instead of the Bloodaxe. (garbled) Who cares? I speak Dwarvish. Thank you. I'm a scholar. It's so good! You play Nadine. Oh man, that's going to be a good Talks later. (laughter) I don't pay attention to that shit. It's almost as if this room is meant to introduce something. (clears throat) No, I just had a tickle in my throat. Oh, did you want me to smash through this very loudly? Gently, with a push, maybe? Fine. Can I push? Wait. Can I try pushing on one of the slabs? The right slab. 24. The right one. Wait, I know a saying for this They make them like they used to! Can I see anything immediately in the-- Look at that! A modifier of zero. 18. I have darkvision because of the belt. There's more tunnels. With your face? Mini Jenga? I've become Death, Destroyer of Worlds. Everybody? 16. Pickle wreck! What is going on?! What are you shooting it with? That's a two. So 28 total. She's at 18, right? Pike. I would like to rage and run up and to this doorway. Five, 10, 15, 20. Can I see anything in this room? Okay. Five. Yep. I don't see anything. Oh, do I feel anything from the black metallic hammer that I'm holding? It's not really enough time. Okay. I'm going to keep coming in here. Really? Yeah? I'll attune to it. I want to attune to it first. Well, I don't see anything in the room, right? Can I make my way through here? Okay. Can I make a reckless attack against him? Craven Head. That's not great. 22. A six. 23. I'm drunk. (laughs) 23, so half of that is 12. 11. I try again. Reckless, great weapon master. Natural 20! I've been doing a d12. Is that appropriate for the hammer? Yeah. So I'd to do a d10? Two-handed. Let's do that. 22, 32. 38. (laughter) Yeah. Yeah, hold on. 46. That was better. Ow. That is. It looked like he dropped it. We know, baby. Hold my antlers, girl. Come on, 20! Doesn't fire work on trolls? Well, that was dumb. Maybe something else, like poison or acid? Isn't it acid? What? (scoffs) Yeah. (singing) Fire! Turn and run? (singing) A do ron-ron-ron, a do ron-ron. Fe fi fo fuck it! Can I run over here? (counting) And I'm going to smashy pants the troll. Reckless, Great Weapon Master. Natural 20. That's the third one today! That's a d10, though. Right, d10? (counting) 63. You think that. It's got upper teeth. Same thing. 19. A natural-- shit, what was it? So it was a-- shit, I can't do reverse math. (laughing) Oh no! That hurt my brain. It was an eight. Thank you. Yeah. This guy has got up and down. Oh, no, now I can't do math at all. 24. 34. Nice. So 17. A little, yep. As my bonus action-- I do have a bonus action-- can I use my second wind? Thank you. 1d10. (counting) 11 points. Yeah, remember you rolled shit? You don't have to hit me! But he just goes back into the necklace. Goodness gracious, great balls of fire! Extra damage because it's undead? There are chests about. Remember, there were three different ways, though, and we took one. Do we want to go through the collapsed doorway, or do we want to go back to one of the other tunnels? Oh yeah, have I finished attuning with the black hammer of face-smash? Do I know it's cursed? It's a familiar feeling? From Craven Edge? I think I'm going to leave this here, if that's cool with you guys. I've got to take a picture of this. He must have fallen against a mountain in an upright manner. That's amazing. Nice job, Matt!
