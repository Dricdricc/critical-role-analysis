Can I ask a question? Since I was obviously out of commission with the whole last fight that happened-- It's not! I was being a politician. Is anybody hurt? Do we need to heal anybody before we go? Did these fireflies mess with any of you? That's fucked up. Whoa. (laughter) Snap. So are we going across the river, then? Ten. But the rapids are right there? We're just watching them fly around. Did we tell them to go fishing? You want to hop on the-- (laughter) I rolled a 25. I know, right? You're going to die live. Roll better. It's because you have a hundred of them. You did? Yeah? Yes, me? I take the Alchemy Jug, and I turn it upside down like diving bell, and I put it over my head. (cheering and applause) Come on, Monstah. (muffled) Okay. Oh shit. Pike! Pull! I got him! 21. I love you for doing *NSYNC. That's a nine. Roll good! Let's just go home. Fuck it. Yeah, right? I figured if anything was going to hit me in the head, it would hit the jug first. How wide's the second river between us and Vax? Fucking hell. They're rapids. Garmelie! Hop in the river! Scanlan, Keyleth, if I had magic, I would freeze all the water, so go ahead and do that. Come on, you stupid opal dice! You've got to retire that bitch. Are there a bunch of trees? How tall are they? And the river's 20 feet wide, right? What did you bring today? How's that going to work? Can you raise earth? Can you make a dam? I'm going to chop down a tree. We are getting nowhere, super fast. Can I walk over to a tree just in case their plan fails? I want to start chopping. I hope your stupid plan works! I'm super bored, so do your plan. Just throw it offstage. Just throw it. Say it. What was it? What? Nope. I'm going to cut down this fucking tree. All right, fine. I'll help. Around me? I'll be in the front. 20. I stepped on a catfish. Can I keep an eye out for whatever I stepped on in the river? Six! That'll hit. We're across! It's not a catfish! 21. Garmelie was in the middle somewhere. 18. This is our first live initiative. We're all going to die. Look at Mercer's face. No way. There's no fucking way. I take what? Nine points! Oh shit, we're all tied together! Yeah. Where did he bite me, by the way? I don't give a fuck! I go into a rage! (cheering) And I use my bloodaxe, and I'm going to start whacking him in his stupid plant monster face. That's a 30. For the second one, it's a 21. So the first one is a 19, plus five points of necrotic damage for 24. And the second one! Oh shit. That's 15, plus another five points of necrotic damage for 20. I've always wanted to be a dog toy! Now I have. I probably should have tried to break the grapple. I haven't hit anything in forever. Yeah, that hits. Yeah, I am. I'm hitting it with a thing! I'm about to get jacked up. We're a big set of anal beads. Blinded and restrained? (singing) Hello, darkness, my old friend! (muffled) Help me! It's halved, right? She needs two more d6s. There's math happening. Help me! Oh, you're all the way over. Can I reach the jug at all? I had it tilted up so I could see. Yeah, we'll retcon that shit. It was in my pocket. And that's my action? No, fuck it. Yeah, but I can't hit anything. I'm like this. Can I take the Titanstone Knuckles, smash them together-- (cheering) Yeah, I'll try that. So I get puked out. Can I use whatever movement speed I have left to drag the daisy chain with me away from the crocodile? Oh yeah. It got separated. 20. Is this for me? Motherfuckers! Yeah. It really is. Monster! I'm telling you. Do I get to chop down a tree, finally? (laughter) Do I get to chop him? I start chopping down the petrified alligator tree! It's made of petrified wood. Okay! (whack) How was that? We've got two more rivers, right? Listen, hey, is anybody near death? I'm super big right now. How about I just throw everybody across the river? You want to? Can I throw Pike across the river? Wait. I need you to smack me in the face first. (impact) I would like to rage! Natural 20. Should I try and skip Vax across the river? (laughter) That's what you get, stupid! Who's next? Yeah, Percy's next! Can I granny shot this one? 19. Who's next? In the spirit of the Olympic games, can I shot put her? Oh shit. No, it's not. It's a 23. I'm strong as fuck. Are you left? Do you want to go with me as I jump across, or should I throw you? No, it's going to be fast-pitch softball. No, wait. I'm going to be a long snapper in football and turn around. (laughter) 19! Oh yeah. No, totally. Come here, bitch. A 20. Total. Oh, no, yeah, I totally hear what you're saying. We're going for a ride, bitch. And I back up. 20 again. 12 plus eight. You don't want to see what happens at the end of the journey? You want to come with us, right? What kinds of things? The little black dog statue? Oh, I like that thing. Wait a minute. How do you plan on getting back across the rivers? Awesome. So we're across the rivers. Everything gets worse now, and we can't stop moving. Is it a treeline? Are we into trees? It's dripping from the trees? Yeah, sit on it! Front or back? By the way, now that we're out of all this shit, can we look around and see if Ukurat has been peeping us this entire time? 15. I fucked it all up. (laughter) I rolled a 14. We're being sneaky, guys! I only stay enlarged for ten minutes. Do I get to reroll my stealth check? How far off is it? Well, what's between us and it? I've got a great idea. Let's send Trinket to go check out the tree. He's a bear, and this is the woods. It was a six? It's the Keebler elves. Kill them all! Yeah. Look, maybe if you let me talk to them-- Then it eats you. I've got your back. I'll go with you. Why?! In order to stay alive, you need to be near the broom. Yeah, the two gnomes go. They're not very intimidating. No! Let the little bits go. Little bits go. I just want to say, that was a death threat in front of a thousand people. (laughter) They're sad, or they're angry also? Then we should all go. We shouldn't just send the little bits in there, we should all go. All right. Attack the tree. What did you find? Oh. (whispering) What did you find? That sounds terrible. Super important question Did they see you? Are you saying we should hide, Percy? Where?
