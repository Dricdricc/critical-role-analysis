D&D Beyond! Fucking dicks. It's great camouflage. Hey! Just leave it there. That's right. There's a limited number. We are. We'll be there around noon thirty for our first panel of the day. Partial, yeah. Look at this one, too. (laughter) Limited number, limited quality. I think there are only one. I like his flaws poops his pants. Son of a-- go ahead and do that. Go ahead. Anything for that butt-shot, Sam. It's like a deity. Jester, don't you think that if that was the Traveler he would have said, "Hey. I'm the Traveler." Yep. He was pretty cool. We were worried. You kind of went into a state. Just making sure you are all right. All right, yeah. Apparently, I raise my hand in this group. That just happened. Yeah, we have a silver ring with a little blue gem on it. Hold on a second! Fucking pace yourself, all right? Yeah, I know. The bling is going to come your way, all right? We have a carved wand. Anybody have a wand that's not carved? It is. Oh, shit. Well. Yeah. We got some chained manacles, they're some big sons of bitches with a bunch of runes on the cuffs. That's great. With you humans-- Yeah, it's real important. We were running into problems-- Jingle jangle jingle jingle. Hey, Caleb. I remember you have an ability to identify? Yeah, sure, yes. Absolutely. Here's the silver ring with the blue gem. Motherfucker. I know! We'll make sure you're not disturbed. Okay, yeah. Molly, I need something from you. Find us a fucking bar. Because the Candleglow Inn is fucking toast. Pub crawl. Very, very generous. Fucking drink up. (chagrined) I narrated it. Hey, Caleb, are you exhausted from that experience? We do have other items to-- We have a carved stick-- wand. Yup. These big fucking chain manacles I've just got over my shoulder. I ain't a fucking waitress. It's a wand of dickbutts. That's the Do I tell them or do I not? Yeah, I was going to say, you can just share. No, I swear I won't. Now it's definitely going to be stolen. We have one other item. Not that I don't love my posture being corrected. How about these them there chain manacles? So I can get my spine back in alignment. Yeah. They're fucking huge. Tell me they're super valuable. That was a fucking bitch to lug around. Seems extreme. Yeah, all right. Well, mysterious wonders. I like that more. Oh yeah, the red glove! Sorry! No, we're just going through stuff. Back to your drinks, everything's fine. Great, yeah. Who's got the oven mitt? Red oven mitt, who's got it? SAM and I'm looking at you while I say it the whole time. I grab the nose piece and go (fwoosh) (impact). (pained) Yeah, ah. I mean, she has a point. I know how to use arcane artifacts. Yes, awesome. Oh. That could come in very handy. Yeah. But sometimes you need batting gloves. I would like to see it. Yep. Hold on. That's a fucking glove of fire. Oh, sweet! What are the properties of it? Okay. Cool. Yeah. It's a Scorching Ray spell. A little plus five. And Nott, may I say thank you for saving my life, because I was in a fucking pickle in there and if you hadn't gone and slaughtered that little baby manticore, I'd have been fucked. So thank you. Did I save your life? I did. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. You're right. It was my pleasure. You would have done it for me. Oh yeah. Should we get another room now that we've got some extra coin? Oh! We can get an extra room. Whoa! Hey, big spender! What? Craft fair Laura is dying. You don't know the old evening nip? (laughter) That was five of them. While everybody is going up to their rooms, can I stay down-- are you staying down? I'll stay downstairs and do some people-watching. Call it character study. Very well. Please tell me she has bedhead. There you go, Freudian slip. Well, I guess it's time to collect on those ears, right? Yes, those ears. Damn! A-Fjord? We're like the mighty. Yeah, why not? There's one, two, three, four-- I will pull your beard off your face. You seem to be at peace with the current situation, I think it might be in our best interest that we moved on. Have they had water? Two is pretty decent, I think. Du, Du mas! Du mas mich! If you wouldn't mind, that would be most kind of you. Fjord. Yeah, F-J-O-R-D. Fjord. No. We're not going to make it through all of them. How is it that you saw him before? Can I do that, too? 23 investigation? Oh, history. 21. Of course, I remember now. The Ruby of the Sea, I can't believe she's your mother. Not exactly. No, she entertains gentlemen. She's hard to describe, a performer, an entertainer or-- Yeah, the name has made itself known all along the coast. You'd be lucky to find yourself in her company, at least how I've heard it. Is the best lay ever, oh god. The best lay ever. (laughter) I imagine that would affect her business a little. And this is why you're looking for your dad? Yeah, plus she looks like she can handle herself in a fight. She'd be most welcome. Yeah, I would love that, thank you, Jester. You know when you sneeze and turn, and pulls the rib out. Congratulations, Nott. This is a very special occasion. It's crisp out. I like it. You fucking busted a rib did you? Yeah, you pulled it. Want me to get it? Yeah, when you sneezed and you turned and lean away from it, boy. Yep. Marisha. Stay frosty. She shouldn't laugh at that. A rib will be pulled when you turn and sneeze. Oh, right before the day goes? I'll take the second. Nine. I will. Thank you, Jester. Oh jeez, that's terrible. Nine! (laughter) That's even worse! What the fuck?! We can't roll perception for shit. Extreme. Cauliflower crotch, baby. Yes. I'm firing. Yes. As well. No, another one. (singing deeply) Bum bum bum. (German accent) The fire starter! Yep. I was Eldritch Blasting him. Just any of them. 19 to hit. That is 12 points of damage. Oh, Trevor's with the wind. See, Trevor done put his fucking nose where it didn't belong. Unless you want to join him, I'd get the fuck out of here. I don't know if you know, but syphilis is fucking contagious. Jester, maybe we can let them have a little fucking dignity as they leave. Molly I think they also need a bath. Yes, that's, yes. I like that a lot. Yeah, like a million bucks. Oh shit. I'll take John. I start kicking the ash of the former leader around to spread him around and fucking lay back down. Nope. Trust me, my system wasn't any better. We've got the fucking Wells Fargo carriage now. We're straight-up Wells Fargo. Yeah, the syphilis is creeping up into your eye cavities. Look over here. Holy shit. Please tell me it's less than a ten. I mean, that's six perception checks in a row that were under ten. I take out that heavy cloak and I put it over my damn head. Nein! Like nobody's going to want metal and we're just going to be driving around that busted jalopy with a shitload of metal. That's very informative, Caleb. Rexxentrum. We should find a place to take some shelter until this rain lets up. What might your name be, kind stranger? It's a fine offer, Ulysses. Where would you have us get out of this rain for a bit? That's D N D. Beyond. Well, Jester, if he's fine by you, I mean, let's get out of the rain, I'm fucking soaked. He recovered from four arrows to the chest. My apologies. The Invulnerable Vagrant? Excellent names in this place. Nudie picture books! Yeah. Run us through it, Encyclopedia Britannica. Give it to us. Don't you? Shittiest pay phone ever. I'm inclined to agree, actually. The longer we keep it out here, the more eyes will be on it. Might be no one home. I'll go in, too. Dive in. Enchanter Pumat Sol, do you have any health potions we might be able to acquire from you? How much would a greater healing potion run me? How about one of the more basic healing potions? A general, yes. I'll take one of those. Fjord. Nice to meet you. How much is that glaive worth? A knapsack of-- Jester, Wand of Smiles. What about for the wand, too? You might need a good laugh. I will take one extra of those potions. It's such a good deal. Here's another 50 gold. Thanks. Thank you for your time. He is instantly at the top. The facial configuration, too. I wish there was more of me. Fuck, so good.
