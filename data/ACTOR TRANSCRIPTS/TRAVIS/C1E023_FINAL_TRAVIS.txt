Do you accept cash bribes? Yeah, it's legit. (slurred) To Jim! Yes, Scabrous Scrotus. Who is in no way related to Grog. Yes he does! He has a giant horn on his crotch. Don't know what that's about. Not until you beat Mad Max. No. Not at all. Oh yeah, it's the start of the 2015 NFL football season. I'll be repping the Dallas Cowboys today. They're not playing right now, but they will be on Sunday. Go Cowboys. We all come from different walks, all right? (laughs) My sorcerer's ways. There goes ball. Chase ball. Yeah. That's rugby. Scrum. Yeah, that's some brutal stuff. I watched it. It's really fun. I'm burping garlic. We wake the next morning. Beard check, please. Zero. Or ten? That's a hundred. That's the second time that's happened. Is it at least rough? Like, you know, he needs to shave, it's so rough. Because it's free to stay there. Can I roll to see if he's bullshitting? Yeah! Grog insight check! Modifier is zero! That's a nine. (laughter) Are my feet behind me, crisscrossing? (singing) Tell me more, tell me more... Did you do nails? Connected. Who wants to-- Maybe we should let Keyleth explain where the flying carpet went. You're right. Tiberius, where did the flying carpet go? If we're going to leave, could I make a small request? I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder. Would you mind terribly if I maybe went out to the street and picked a fight? I want Kern. I'm sure. I can't do it. I have to do it by the rules. Yeah. Is there a tavern downstairs or anywhere they'd have cups or wineskins? Oh, thank you. Did you say you encourage my violence? I take off running out the room. (laughter) Was there a window in the room? Okay, just checking. (shouting) Kern! And the Star Trek reference is good. His name's Kern; it's fun. Bring me the body of Kern. Aye, you heard right. Aye, where everyone can see, and he can't hide. Nope. I don't. Yeah, my Belt of Dwarvenkind is the only thing, but that's all. It's all right. I turn to the bookie, and I take out my entire coin purse, and I throw it at him. I throw him the coin purse and I say, I expect to see that doubled when I get out. And I jump into the pit before Kern even arrives. According to this, it's eleven-- that can't be right, can it? 1,363. He's missing a lip. (laughs) That's an excellent bet. That is an excellent bet, Keyleth. I reach into my belt and I pull out his upper lip, and I give it a smell and I say, I've enjoyed it very much. I've come to collect the rest. And I fling it into the pit. Hold! Surely a man of your stature would honor me by sharing a drink before this battle. How much is left in there? (sniff, sniff) I don't drink such piss water. I pour it out. I take out my own wineskin that I filled with the stone giant strength, and I chug it down. Or the stone giant, yeah. I got it down already. (laughter) (singing) We're going to need a montage, a montage. No! Philip is dead. There is no Philip. There is only Grog, the Vengeful. (cheering) Enough words, toothless. Let's do this. Oh, I get advantage, don't I? That's better. 20. 20. I race towards Kern, and I duck down as if I'm going to go into a form tackle towards his waist. I take a step to the side at the last second and wrap my arms around his waist from behind, pick him up to DDT him over my shoulder. (cheering) Okay. (laughs) 25. 18 plus seven. Six. Right, with that action, I would like to go into-- does it take an action to rage? Which is what this is? I would like to rage. (cheering) That hits. Yeah, that'll hit, too. Okay. He got nine points of damage? No problem! All right, I would like to enter a frenzied rage, and I would like to-- since he moves off to my side, I see him move, and I throw a back fist into the concave area of his nose. 23. Great. That is-- motherfucker, six. Yes. I would like to then reach forward, as he's reeling back from that hit, with both of my thumbs and throw them towards his eyes. 14. If he knocks it aside, I take my right leg and I throw it to the outside of his kneecap, trying to snap his ACL or MCL. That's a 27. Why didn't that happen before? That's seven. I would like to move to flank his right side. That hits. That hits. That misses. Okay. Okay. All right. (grunts, pants) I see you've been taking some ballet. How very cultured of you. And I rush forward. I'm between him and the wall? Okay. (laughs) I rush up and get him, give him a little nasty-- of the last time for a double thunderclap, to either side of his ears. That is a 13. That's all right. Since I didn't find any purchase, I'll see where his ears are, try and grab them, and I'm going to attempt to rip his ears off of his head. His nice pointy ears. 16. (sighs) Third attack. 14. I would like to use my Stone's Endurance. That's 16. Oh, fantastic. I'll keep that leg up in the air. I'll move it over to my shoulder, take both my hands up and bring it down on top of his kneecap, hyper-flexing the leg. (yelling) That's better. 26. (cheering) That was my first. What's the matter, ballerina? I thought you should be stretched out and ready for this. And I reach back and I drive my fist into his nutsack. (laughter) 25. Eight. My first eight. Oh, that's right, okay. With that last one, can I take my right leg and in an effort to shoot for that same knee I've been kicking at, aim for the knee or sweep his feet? Fuck. That'll miss. It's a 13. That hits. In an effort to keep my distance, I run towards him, I jump up in the air and throw one thrust-kick towards the side, right towards his chest, just to see what his defense will do. Well, that was a natural 20, but 19. Total 19. Can I add the inspiration to the-- no, just to the roll, right. That is an eight. Halved. So half of three is one and a half, and we're rounding up? Right, so eight. I leap forward again and try to throw my thumbs into his eyes. 21-- aw. 15. That's a 22. 24. With the four? Six. Can I move? I just back straight up. Oh, really? I'll move along the wall to his left side. Yes. Yes. And back up just a little bit. Yeah. All right, you seem to be rolling pretty high. You could use the dice that I threw. Misses! Okay, that misses. All right. I want to move-- no, I'll stay right where I am. Can I reach forward, grab his head and his shoulder, and go in for a bite attack at his neck? (growls) Yes! Aiming for the jugular. 23. All right. Eight. Yeah. Plus six. This is halved. No, we halve the die. I eat bar stools for dinner. I pull back from the bite, and I whisper into his ear, I was wondering what was going to break first your spirit, or your body. And I would like to try to pick him up over my head and bring him down on my knee, Bane-style. Okay, that's 25. Do I need to roll on advantage to see if I get a 20? Oh, it's a 19. It was so close! 26. Son of a bitch! Seven, so 14. (cheering) Matt reaching for things is never good. I reach up with my fingernails, and I carve these scrapes down my face, and I leap up with both feet, and I jump down on his head. (yelling) That's better. 23. You know what? Just three of them. (battle cry) 20. 15. Did I roll? It's good. Eight and eight! That's a one. That hits. I would like to attempt to break that grapple. That is 21. Both of my bonus actions, or all three? I blow through my newly lipless mouth, (laughs) and I run up and I throw my face into his. That's a 17. Wait, that was just my one attack. I broke the grapple! No, I'll stay there. Hits. (sighs) Misses. Okay. I reach forward, throw that leg towards the right knee again. Still working on the same spot. Miss. That's a 21. And I miss. That's an eight. That hits. Misses. That hits. Okay. Am I back to the wall? I'd like to take a step back, put my back foot on the wall, and then push off into the air with a huge overhand right. That's a 22. Eight points of damage. And then I say, you were supposed to be the only lipless one. And I soccer ball the shit out of those dimes between his legs. (laughter) That is seven. Is he still standing? Is he bent over? What? Did you lose something? No? You'll lose it now. And I do it again. 19. Eight! Thank you, Percy. Okay. It's 18. Oh, that misses. Yeah, sorry. Right. It's my turn? I come back from that knee to the solar plexus. I reach out and grab the back of his head, and I drive my elbow straight into his chin. 25? Yes! Eight. As it carries through, I'd like to come back with a back elbow, same spot. Boom. 16. Last one? Since I'm standing and I probably whiffed, I see that knee that I've been working on, and I throw my heel out and try and pop it in. Yes! 27. Eight. Hits. Hits. Ten points. Okay. Okay. Right, okay. So that puts me at negative 13. I use my Relentless Rage. 21. One hit point. I look at my arms, I look at him, I spit blood into the sand, and I say, well, well. Where have I seen this happen before? Time's up. And I run forward and in a massive arcing uppercut, I drive my fist under his jaw with everything I have. Oh, damage? Okay. Oh, shit. 18? I look down and I say, (sighs) Very well, respect. And I take my elbow and drive it into his temple. 15. (laughing) Don't, no. I've missed the uppercut. Missed the elbow. I take both of my fists up over my head, and I just bring it down. 13. Okay. Misses. I want to leap at him and try and grab him around the waist. I get three-- no. All right, fine, fuck it. With desperation that this might fall away, I throw my goliath fist at him. 19. Nine. 17. 22! Eight! (chuckles) As the fist connects and he starts to wobble, I reach over. I stand above him and grab around his waist with his back facing towards me. I lift him up over my head so that his head gets to come up and look at the crowd one last time before sending him straight back onto his shoulder blades and neck and smashing him into the earth! I put my foot on his chest and do my best King Kong. (yells) I run over and grab my lip and pick it up and go, just between you and me, is there anything we can do with this? (laughter) Right, or growing a beard on it-- oh, that's already on my chin. I'm actually sweating. Grog's not here right now. This is Philip. If you'd like to leave a message, come back another time. Got to go, bye! And I walk away. I find Scanlan in the crowd, and I reach out and shake his hand. Sorry, little bit of ongoing rage. I heard your voices cutting through the crowd. Where are Tiberius and Keyleth? Outside? Fuck that shit. (laughs) I was about to, but chaotic neutral, sorry! (laughter) I was ready. I did. And I pay it back happily as I look at her dragon eyes of money hoarding. And handing money to Vex has sobered me up a little bit. I do walk over to Kern the Hammer and extend a hand and say, well fought, brother. Yes! Strength and honor! When the time comes for a rematch, I'll be here. (quietly) Oh shit. If I'm not here at the Crucible, because I don't think you need an audience for glory, you can always find me in Emon at Castle Greyskull. Greyskull Keep! What? You're in holding? Yeah, I'm sure. I'm a pretty big deal. Tiberius, what can you see around you? The mustache is up. Tiberius, thank you for your efforts. You, as well, Keyleth. Thank you. I'm the champion. Are we in the tavern? Are there any small lads running about or maybe excited to see me or something? Are there any younger men that are-- I walk over to one of them and I pull out a gold coin and I say, how would you like to make a gold coin, son? Wait! I reach into the Bag of Holding. I take out the second-place medal, the participant medal, and I go, make sure Kern gets this. (laughter) You sick fucks! (laughter) Yeah! [break] Thanks, bud. Thank you, Tiberius. Or glass of water. Here's two gold. We're getting ore, right? Doesn't Percy want ore? He had a lovely beard! That's a great name! Aye, and I do. If I wanted to find this Earthbreaker Groom-- Oh. Groon. Right. The other one's weird. Would I find him in the middle of the Trial Forge? Too easy. Too easy! I would actually like both the twins to go with. No. Nice, Percy. I mean, come on, come the fuck on! We're going to see Earthbreaker... SAM and What? Yeah, you know I don't like talking. I go forward. Eyes closed? I step forward and say (coughs) Sorry to disturb, I'm looking for Earthbreaker Groon. Okay. I keep the little bit of pee that's about to fall out from falling out, and I say I happened to see you amongst the crowd at my recent tussle. It seemed that everyone there seemed to know who you were. I wanted to at least introduce myself. That's right! (coughs) That's right. I don't really ask. I only mean to say that Vox Machina is at your disposal, if you would ever need someone outside of the amazing Braving Grounds, Vasselheim. We're really amazing. If you would just keep us in mind. I mean to. Thank you. It has been an honor being in your presence. I turn around and I go Guys, his fucking eyes are glowing. Thanks. Did you hear all of that? I almost had an aneurysm. Yeah we should go. He's cool. Yeah, sans shit. And we're out. No. And we make our way out of the golden-floored, glowing-eyed guy's house. Ooh! You want me to hold onto all that for you? We should go in. Hold on, Tiberius wants to say something. Okay, here we go. We'll go out this way. To the keep. He's a good butcher. Yep. Train him up. Oh, he won't? Did you never see The Incredibles? (laughter) Can we rest before we go see this ranger? Look through your shit. Is this real? Is it a real thing? Is it real? He can do this? Please feel free to speak. It's Percy's call. I don't really do formal, so? We've got like two left, and they wouldn't fit me.
