It's got the logo on the back too. Is that the kind DM shirt, or is that the evil sarcastic-- Yeah, pretty much. Bright and early, Anime Weekend Atlanta. We're there Friday, Saturday, Sunday, come down, see us and throw things in our face. That'd be great. When he walks back. Yep, that's him. No, they took it and ran, it was part of the penance. We fought bravely. It's buck naked from here on out. I have a question. Should we ask the Sword of Kas, since it's fought Vecna before, does it know of any weaknesses? Sorry. I need to sit. (gasp) That's a good idea Percy! Oh my god, yes. Wait, wait, if I pull it out of the sheath to talk to it-- can I talk to it through the sheath? I might have to draw it and then it's going to need the (glugging). You?! Look, listen, I made a promise to your brother, he was very adamant that I'm supposed to stick it-- Do you want just a hand slice or do you want to up the ante and I stick it in your thigh? I do have to bathe it, it has to be quite a coating. Okay, cool, come on Percy. Buy the ticket, baby! So can I unsheathe Kas? Do I get to pick where? Okay. I reach around to the back of his knee and I pull along there. Yeah, when you shave your legs the back of your knee is the tricky part, right? Respectfully, Kas, I had a few questions because I am on board to satisfy your maniacal desires to fuck up Vecna and all that he stands for, right? Oh no, Kas? Oh, thank god. Might need more blood soon. Do you know of any weaknesses that Vecna has, or opportunities that we could explite? Apparently he's really smart, and is arro-- aromatic. He likes to put on a show, I think. Yeah. Doesn't make much sense, apparently he builds whips out of plots. Oh right, he strings things together like a web, you know, like a dog makes. Yeah, oh god, he's really adamant about cutting the webs. Yeah. I guess Vecna has spider abilities. Pro-tip. Any physical weaknesses, or things that he is vulnerable to that we should know? Him, okay, cool, I think we've got everything. To him. All right, next time I pull you out in the light it will probably be to kill Vecna or someone that I don't like. How's your knee, is it okay? I got a whole bunch of more hit points. It's like, I don't know. But I was thinking, I have all three trammels, right, and I need to get real close to do anything to Vecna. Is it stupid for me to have all of them? So we don't get paralyzed. I reach over to Pike, I spin her around, are there any wings on the back? I don't know how to break this to you. They're not there yet. I turn her upside down, look at her feet. I turn her back. Just keep wishing, they'll grow in. Okay. Thank god, because I don't have any more. Do I have to attune to them? Does my speed translate to going up things as well? I have the Feral Leaping boots. If he's more than 20 feet in the air, I'm fucked. Yeah, but I'm not using the axe or the hammer, I'm using the sword. Yeah, but it's only one attack per action. Instead of three. What are you planning on doing? Here's the thing, last time we fought Vecna, he went higher than 30 feet, he was up where Vax was before he fell. Oh. It's just jewelry. Boring. Yeah. So good. No truesight? No seeing through this? No, no, on. We're going to pull it over on Vecna. We're fine. This is a great plan. Do it, man. Do it. We're overthinking it. And we're definitely doing the pillars? No, I mean, are we, or are we not? Okay, cool. We're doing the pillars. No. Just do it, man. It's okay. Isn't Wish instantaneous? You want bracers of defense? Plus two to your AC? I'm real excited, actually. Like, you know, you always want to test yourself to see what you're made of, what is your mettle really like. We're going to find out. We're really going to find out. Nobody else excited? Yeah. Together, right? SAM and Yeah. I love all of you. (snores) (snorts awake before returning to snoring) Boobies. And we sleep. Yeah. What are you holding over there? First roll, first roll, first roll. 11. Burning it already? Six points. Brothers in arms! Yeah! No, I'll run in. Save it for battle! This is what we do. What's that? Plus a d10 to my initiative now? 22. Yeah, I run up. I'm going to run up, and grab it by the head and neck and lay on it. Shock collar. If it barks, it activates. She has something that makes her less clanky-like. Aw, yeah! No way. Okay. Maybe not the best reunion time. How high up? Good pitch. Wait. You can't die? Well, he said, like, "She thought I was dead, but my queen--" Thank god he's wearing that armor, huh? When do we want to do Freedom of Movement stuff? Not yet? Does anyone know that you're here? I smash (stumbling) mitheens. (drawn out) Mitheens. What? Oh. 19. Let's find the crystals. That's okay, Matt. Let it happen. I'm not really so keen on making doors, as opposed to knocking them down. I'm a craftsman. All right. I'm just, me. Oh, fuck yeah. Don't share it. Oh, yeah. Not only should we back up a little bit, except for me, we should also have an area that we're going to run to, right? Because I'm sure this will bring the noise. MARISHA and Arkhan's going to stay, just in case it needs, like, a double-- Yeah. You know. Sky's clear. Actually. Well, hold on. You got to stay here, right? Because of the-- I would like to rage. And I go Tiger Uppercut! and I just punch the roof of it. Yeah, destroy. 23. That is 15. Just by itself. So. One more? LAURA and 24. I'm standing there like a catcher, ready. We're coming around that planet. I got this, guys; don't worry. Three. We're going to hide? If he spots us, we scatter and spread, but. Oh, 16. No, 18. I did. Plus we have one extra ally. Two! (shouting) Oh this is it! Oh no! SAM and Most amazing 2d10 roll ever. Take it. Okay. Come on, come get some! Thanks to Kas, 27. 18, 17? I always do this. It's just not that intense of a fight. Vax, what were you again? Vax. It's me. Already raging. Let's see, there's a window, right? Can I run upstairs? And I jump out the motherfucking window. Is that my full 50? Awesome. So I'm going to double dash with the spider boots that Percy gave me and I'm going to run up the tower and just go straight, yeah. One dash. Yeah, why you making me feel dumb? Am I within melee of that skeleton dragon? The bone dragon? Perfect. That's my turn. With my bonus action can I make it a frenzied rage? I don't know where Vax is. I forgot his number. Percy, Arkhan, Pike. I get all names wrong. I know. When there are too many dice to roll, the phone comes out. The deliverance of the death? The method chosen? We've got a dragonborn paladin. We're fine. I'll make it reckless. I believe it's Arkhan. It's a 34. This dragon would be considered undead, yes? So with the sword's 2d10 slashing damage to undead, that's 32 points of damage. You've got this. Focus in. You got it. Walk in the park. I thought it was Bugs Bunny, but you did Woody Woodpecker. Did you rage? I did. You have to hold it. We don't do math fast ever. Dump it, dude. Legendary action incoming. Does he have advantage on wisdom something? In the clutch. It's what Earthbreaker did. Toothless? Which one are you? Prime or Two? Really? Wow, your reverse math was super fast just then. That would have taken me five minutes. Keyleth. That hits. With advantage. Oh, wait. That's a d10. Natural 20. (relieved noises) I told you, it's the jam. Can I jump to the top of the bannister here so I'm looking down at old tangled-up Delilah. (sighs) May I leap off the tower and straight onto Delilah's prone body? 25. I fucking hate this dead bitch. And I raise the sword and start swinging down in these huge arcs at her. The first two attacks at her. Are they with advantage because she's prone? So not reckless. Natural 20. (cheering) Should I roll the second attack? (counting) 21 plus 14. Help me. 35? 35. 35, okay. So that's those. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Oh, that's before the modifier. Just 35. 51. No, I mean my brutal critical. I roll the damage die, an additional-- Two times, yeah. Two damage dies at this level. Three? 62. I rolled pretty low. Did you want it out? Here, let me help you out (yells) and put it back in! That is a 32. 24. I was going to do something to Sylas but fuck it, we're going to hit her. 33 to hit. 23. Nope, nope. 23 plus-- I wasn't even adding-- I was so excited about the sword damage I was forgetting my rage damage. I did, yeah. The d10 plus 2d10 slashing damage to undead right? Oh, she's not? Oh shit. I figured she was dead, then not dead-- 22. 24. But I hadn't added my-- Okay fair enough. Shit, I'm so sorry. So that's 21. Yeah. Yep. I thought she was undead, just figured. Oh, really? Sylas is undead. The dragon's undead. Are the gloomstalkers undead? Not undead? Hunter's Mark? No you don't. Like done? Were her hands her own hands? His first one? Yeah, through all material. Atta boy! 6d8? Holy shit. (laughing) That's bad? Oh man. Come on, now! I did not know that. What if I made this a reckless tripping attack? I don't know. I don't know if it would ground him for one second or not. I don't know. That's why I'm asking the DM. I'm going to do reckless Trip attack. 34. He's undead, right? Oh, no, please. No, you were up first, I insist. Arkhan, please. Yeah, 17 and then I roll a d8 or I add a d8. It's my first one I've ever rolled. Five. Shit, what did I say? It's a trip attack. Oh, I'll pull it up. I've got it right here. Does his hand turn into a bat with him? Or does that fall-- Plus we're still in initiative order. Can he use a legendary resistance on a grapple? I want to see what the inside of them looks like. When he was in the gaseous form. Y'all, we recruited dead Delilah! Testosterone poncho. I don't want to overthink this, but I feel like the sword said that it wanted to cut the webs of Vecna. Can I just cut the tower down? I take your laugh as a sign of-- I could, couldn't I? Perhaps not. That's a big fat no! Can I take one of the fancy robes that remains in the Bag of Holding and drape it over the trunk coming out of her chest, so it's a little more hidden? Behemoth. Is it dead? Undead? If it doesn't work, we kill it. He might. You got it. 22. Bring them into the CRU, you got them! Vasselheim was just out the window. Beacon of Hope. 2d8, 16. Are we doing a group thing right now? Yeah, we're at the gates. All right, do it. Do the short rest. Just do it. A quarter, or half, of Vasselheim, is-- Don't take your superior, though. One-sixth of the pie. Vote as a group. Hand up if you want a short rest. No hands? Just put your hand up if you want it. Keyleth, put your hand up. I'll tie-break it. It's super fast. Natural one. Because he also turns people, right? I barely made that save. I think this is the verge. She has a Death Ward. Who wants the Death Ward? But who wants it? Who needs it? I've got my one hit point regenerate, regenerate, regenerate. Sealing of what? Oh, the trammels? You've got to put it on Scanlan. What does your speech do, Keyleth, again? I take out the Immovable Rod and have it in my hand. We would need Dispels. His dead brother, and-- I'm sorry, I thought, you know-- Got to pay respect. Come on, buddy! Come on! Come on! Yeah. I'm not worried one bit. I did! Do you want to Cirque du Soleil this thing? We'll hold arms and I'll walk on the ceiling? Yeah, I will walk up on the wall so that I'm sticking out. Because I was inverted, bullshit. Top Gun? Thank you. Treat me like your fucking dragons-- French girl, whatever. Hand wraps, get some aviators? It'd be totally cool. I'm still raging. 25. Not a problem. What happened to you guys? Is there anything else to catch fire that would travel upward toward us as we're climbing a towering inferno? Any weapons or items besides the chains and manacles on the floor? Call it out. I got it. I'll pick it up and start reading. Actually, Delilah is. Last one I have. You got it. They're facing away from us? There's no chance you could remove the stone from the middle of the floor and have them fall? If we don't think the room or the setup will fuck us up, the big boys can go in and probably handle it. Or we can follow your attacks. I would send in the dragonborn, because they're all alive. Jocks Machina does not get hazed. No, we don't know anything yet. No, there's no way. Don't do that. This is some Seven shit right here. I'd almost rather him stay and fight. Me? I'm a fan of adrenaline. With pleasure. Haste?! (gasps) What did you do?! You Kevin Spacey from Seven mother fucker! What did you do? (terrified laughter) Oh my god! You're welcome! Any time. You've got surprises and then you've got that shit. Thank god you rolled a one.
