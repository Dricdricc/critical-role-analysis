It's not that we don't remember, we just don't care. It's true. That's hilarious because it's true. It's a big anniversary for them. Can you just play on his harmonica, or something? Come to Anaheim, 4,000 seats! We want to see everyone within a reasonable driving or flying distance. Just roll with it. (laughs) Great one. YouTube it! Perfect timing. Charge headlong into danger with no lessons having been learned from the previous sessions. Naked and running in full steam. Yeah. No Vestiges, no nothing. I'm so happy right now. Ah, deception. First things first. Right. How do we get there? We don't take, like, a ship? Right. Says him. Psh. Oh, I got it! We kidnap the president of hell and we assume his visage. Why? Have you seen him? Feel like I'm going to forget this. I've got special gloves. Like a what? You're going to make me a special hand muff? (laughter) Is there any worth to only a few people, or one or two, going in to get a lay of the land, once we get there? Instead of just moving in our truffle-shuffle normal formation. I'll do it. I'm very stealthy. What is the problem with that? We got away with it, right? Did we get caught? Did we get caught, Tary? No. Tary is very excited about my plan. It's affecting his memory of what happened. Yeah, peruse the last 90 pages for the last hour. If you don't use a turn signal, if you have a vanity plate, you go to hell. (laughter) Really? Pike, Tary, what else? (laughs) Nope. So we kidnap the president. (laughter) Good. Slick. When we went to the City of Brass we were owned, right? That's what let us move around so freely? There's nothing that we need to think about like that so that we have-- You actually become that thing. Yeah. I don't believe you. Yeah, he does have a slight point. Maybe we do them a favor, it's not like we're saying-- I got lost, but I agree. It's literally right there. Motherfuck-- Oh, do you have those potions? Perceived it? Are you sure you don't want to give me one? Because I usually end up pouring it into one of you sloppy saps. Yeah, yeah. Get up. (laughs) What? Yarr. Oh, good question. Frederick. What about D-Roll? Tary, do you want me to punch you in the face? Sam's stuff is right there, isn't it? Can we tear off your sleeve and then you understand Infernal? We could try. You can't just off-the-cuff that. You've gotta save that for something. Yeah, do that! Yeah. You get to suck. Nope. LAURA and That is not true. (laughter) Oh, I dunno, I never look that far ahead. It keeps disappointment low. Yep. Goals? Hey! (with a mouthful of drink) I don't have any plans, so I do anything and it normally works out great. You don't need to see all the way to the horizon, right? You just gotta see right in front of your own little feet. You'll get there. Yep. Not yet. Percy. Are you going to be like Mr. Bates on Downton Abbey afterwards? "I learned it from you!" (laughter) You're going to shroom your tits off. Tree beasts or three beasts? Is it all water outside still? Like, a little bit of water on the ground? No. We're not there anymore. There's so much water outsi-- (laughter) Taste of choice. Takes a strong constitution. It's so pure, it never leaves a hangover. (laughter) (whispers) Insight check. Ai. She's not even waiting for it. Brilliant. You're not going to ask her any questions? But she's a fuckin' felon on the run from the Hells. You're just going to let her go-- No, you're a fool. You're blind. She's a mass murderer and you let her pick your vegetables. It's a great cover. She's got more people to bury. Make it the last word in a four-sentence line. Regularity. How did it go? Did you learn everything? I expected it to go pretty fucking well. Oopeck. That's it? That's all you got? Did you believe her? What's her last name? She's coming with us though, right? Nononono! How do we feel about kidnapping the nine-year-old tiefling? Tary do you remember how dangerous the kraken was? And this is like-- (whispers) what's a big number? This is, like, seven times more dangerous. Only if you want to become, you know, a full-fledged, permanent, into-the-histories member of Vox Machina. Mm. Wise choice. A wise choice. It's only like part of it. Do you have a will made up? Don't worry about it, we'll get to that later. I will shave both of your heads. (electric razor noise) I'm above you. The Divine Gate. We didn't say it. Holy shit! [break] The box is really sweet, We just saw it. That's weird. Send up a flare. What? (groans) Ugh, it's Tucson. Is it like a fondue pot of nine people in one? This guy needs some calcium. Right next to that beautiful picture of a-- Do we know what layer we're in? Oh, we gotta find the-- Open market, right? Yep. Please don't make me be the one that remembered all the shit about Dis. I mean, I am The Grand Poobah de Doink of All of Dis and That, so. Y'all motherfuckers is coming with me. Ahh! Mayonnaise (squelching noise). Or how much I love it? Sam said he can cast Alter Self on himself plus three others. Okay. Female? Heroes' Feast. Whoa! Cool! Wow. That's true. I lean over to Vex, and I say, oi. In an effort to blend in, should we just kill a random person? I just thought of it, so does that mean it's called for? Is that what you do here? They might really like it here. Oh. Right. I'm glad I asked you. Okay. Asking you? Love you, Detroit. Natural snitch. If you roll one more natural 20, it's just going to dissolve into gold dust and float away. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah! Get. The fuck. Out of my nightmares. And we all fall out. Is the ground as hot as the walls are? Jesus. It's like a parking lot in Texas. Is there anything about the humans in particular? Are they wearing anything unusual, or do they have any company with them that might denote why they're allowed to roam about? Empty? (whispers) I bet it's one of those little dudes we had. I am currently spitting on the ground and watching it evaporate. Ooh! He said a familiar creature. We're still outside. Slick! He's literally eating raw meat and blood. Let's be honest, it doesn't really matter what we think about that price. Does that burn you? Oh! (laughs) Of course! Yeah, yeah. We got one left, let's take it upstairs. He said three of them. Oh yeah. How many souls did you just buy? Like a whole family. Back to the plan. And then the Feast? Can I touch the door with my pointy finger real quick? Is it burny? Oh my god. Yep, that thing was still alive. I'm not topped off; I need four hit points. Thank you. He's rolling. We've got to get arrested. Keyleth will get arrested, no problem. Dispator. Wait, you said it wasn't fully formed, right? It's still, like, in its goo phase? Am I the only one that feels like this is an awful lot of trouble for something that's not a problem yet? Not in a chocolate egg? Okay. Small question we checked in as-- you checked in as tieflings. For bursts of an hour, each time? There's only a few rooms in this place, right? I would think so-- ol' broken sausage finger may be sharper than we think. Hey, I'm really hungry, can we have that fucking Feast now? They pump oxygen in, you can stay up as late as you want. Come on, now. We might not come back. Here. (sighs) Oh Tary. He's losing hit points from this. Are we staying in? For the, for a bit? We've only been traveling for like a few hours, right? Yeah, so if we've got to find our way to some sort of prison, two options. Get arrested. Or ask people where people go who get arrested, which seems really fishy and stupid. I wish I had some bacon right now. You know, I still look the way I did when I checked in. Looking like me going to go and do all the recon. What? You and I, me and the tiger? But you said Minxie. Where are you pointing, over here? I can't see. I've got a head of hair in the way. Where'd you point? Yeah, but it's more angry. They're going to want to steal you and put you in a cage. Yeah, and I go down as just backup. Oh, you did a rail of soul, huh? Okay. Sweet! He did! He's so causal, he was like, (inhales, then roars) (laughter) Oh no. What comes out of the bottle? Okay. Greg. What does the chalice smell like? I take a big old sip. This, I'm sure you know, is really good. I had too much of this wine. Anybody looking at us strange? I've made up my mind. No, no, it's you and me down here. If you want your glasses back, we decide here and now. Damn it! Apparently people are listening to everything. So no names. No specifics. How many empty soul stones did she have while we were gone? I don't think it matters, though. We gotta kill someone. And then get arrested for it. I understood that we kill him, then when we go to the prison, he knows people in the prison who would make sure that we find our way to the right places. But that's the shady part. Business. Well, if we've got your code name, what'll we call you? TALIESIN and Freddie. Right. I still like D-Roll, but whatever. Freddie, how do you feel about this plan? Right. But do you have any amendments to it? Would you change it somehow? Who's to say where he's going? Right. So my thought, right? Is that I think we have to be arrested. Breaking into a prison seems real tough. At least with this guy's plan, if he's lying, the worst we get is just straight-up arrested, which I would assume means all our toys get confiscated, right? So, not all of us go on the killing. Yeah. And if he's a man of his word, then those people that are in get led along to this magic place where you can go and smash Chicken Little. But if he's a lying piece of shit, like I'm sure everyone else is, we're going to need someone on the outside-- Really? And do what? I think we go perform the hit, and then we leave Tary, I mean Barry, to get arrested. Right? Like super-secret spy. No, this is a very privileged role. Yep, big-time macho-man stuff. Yeah! He's ready for more responsibility, right? Really? (sings) Don't say no to this. Yeah, me too! Archdevil is the Pope of this area. Definitely something big with big, red, flashing wings, though. Do we all want to kill the thing? Explain to me about the contract. So, in the contract, if he doesn't hold up his end of the bargain, like, he explodes or something, right? It's a magic contract? Because if we get arrested, and they take all our goodies, and we're in a cell, I'm going to kill all of you with my bare hands. Prison assault. We don't know where the prison is. What? No. Hey, Beekus, you just said his real name. So, hey, Freddie, like, how long do you think guy downstairs will give us to decide? Not supposed to make any deals. We could just try and do it on our own. The deal might put us in a position where we're totally fucked. We don't even know where the prison is. You think. Isn't that the way life is? Just take off running around the city, man. Boom! Marathon Woman. Go get it. (sings) She's a maniac, man-- oh, he's down there! How do you fly? Can you do that and concentrate at the same time? Yeah, sure off, go on. Fly off by yourself, nobody cares. How do you go? You get captured or eaten out there, we're done for the night anyway. (laughs) Imps. This is your game, go for it. Do it. Have that backup character ready. (laughter) Go get it, keep going. Momentum! Yeah, ermahgerd-- (sings) Highway to the danger zone. I could be many people, it could all f-- Silence! (laughter) It's royal "we". Multiple bags.
