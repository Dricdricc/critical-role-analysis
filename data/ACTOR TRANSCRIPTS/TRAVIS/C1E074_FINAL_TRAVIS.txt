It's new, yeah. Five dollars off Loot Crate and Loot Crate DX if you use promo code CHAOTICGOOD. All caps, one word. The code is only good for 48 hours. It is true. 48 hours only. CHAOTICGOOD! I will be in the bathrooms. Ask if they need their hands dried. Mine is just going to be animal noises. (braying) You wish you knew. Check out the playlist to find out! He found a tape recorder. We have Nerf Guns. You brought Jello? Also Talks. Talks Machina will be live every Tuesday at 700pm on Alpha. Every week, there will be like two to three of us on there, answering questions, giving insight. November... It will be on there, and you can find out all of the juicy details, who Grog is really in love with. And you can follow @talksmachina on (shouts) Twitter! There are so many cool things! There will be gift giveaways and all sorts of stuff. Yeah, it's going to be fun. We are going to haze Brian Foster every single week. Oh, Pike. Good to see you. High five! The Monstah has spoken. You guys actually write notes? I just draw pictures. Oh, good. Orc skull? Is that what they call it? "Come through my establishment?" In and out of the doors. Wait, wait. One... Somebody else do this. We're just reconning. (fart noise) Can I check the skies? Anything flying around? Hey! This will go well. Three! (gasp) Pike! What? It's tiny right? Yeah, he chirps I bet. Can you make thorbilly land on your finger like a Disney princess? And you rolled a dick. Yeah, no yeah. He was very scared. (laughter) Do we need a white flag as we approach? Come on, man! MATT and Of all the sounds you could make! It's like the Alamo. Which ended well. Shit. Pardon my bluntness, but any flybys by Thordak himself? We may be able to help, though. At least where resources are concerned. Could we load up a cart, though, and wheel it through? To here? General, can I ask, are you close with Mikael? Consider yourself friends? I mean, it didn't even take a second. Not one second. Have you no decency? Pick a fight. Pick a fight with the general, then. Good. That's good. Oh, we do. We've killed, like, a number of them and none of us have died yet. We started with this many, and this many is still here, is what I mean. Yeah, it's a montage waiting to happen. (singing) Going to build some tunnels, make them look real cool! Yeah, resources and food. Yeah, baby! I saw this movie called The Martian. If we shit all over everything, it'll grow. Yeah, lots of potatoes grow from shit. In the meantime, Percy could take a look at some of the weaponry. Maybe look at building a tunnel, or a bunker. Really? Oh my god. Liam and I will give you a dunking in the bathroom after the break. Percy, what do you think of looking at all this weaponry? Do we want to crack out the mansion? Fuck yes. Also awesome. Supply for days. General? Just because, like, I'm an inquisitive mind, what is the travel time from here to Emon on foot, on a beast? Those two. Wow. Cool. Good deal. No, I was seeing if I could run there in a night and back. No, I'm not fucking running over there. Are you crazy? I was just curious. That mess hall-- is there a gathering quarters for the soldiers? General, please don't take this the wrong way. Do you trust your men? And there are none that you worry about, none that have expressed a lack of confidence, none that you're keeping your eye on? Giving you a weird feeling? I like that answer. Shit. They've got a 300-year supply. (laughter) Yeah! Takes the water skin and just-- Right. Keyleth is necessary to get to the Feywild. So it's going to be Keyleth and one of the twinsies go to the Feywild, right? I don't have it? You know, there is that fire elemental plane with the last Vestige, eh? Why? What's life without a little risk? And they've got werewolves in their woods. You howl. Yeah, I don't know how to reach my herd. No, they wander to and fro. The Herd. The Platinum Dragon. That's what I'm saying. No, no. I said the word "platinum." I was there. And you robbed me of it. I did it right. Didn't the werewolves want to leave the Feywild, right? They wanted out. And as far as we remember, the people of Vasselheim. Their general temperament is Vasselheim takes care of Vasselheim. Right. We could go talk to that Earthbreaker Groon. She is? He fucked some shit up. Spike! Ukurat. LAURA and Kash, Kima. Gross! Yeah. Yes. We go in. Emon, right now. Full ball. Full blush. Why are you so anxious to go to the Fire Plane all of a sudden? Insults, cheese. Bruised bananas. Hey, Pike! Did you know that we have all the Vestiges except for the one in the Fire Plane, and you'll never guess what it is. What is it? I forgot. It's some plate armor! Just pure death and destruction. That's true. Did we establish a way to contact her? Oh, we did! She was checking on-- It was two things. It was Asoon and... Bassoon, whatever. And what was the other thing? Oh, shit nails! Oh she was going to Emon to hold up the bluff that everything was cool was Thordak, right? She was going to bluff, and then she was also going to try to bring back Seeker Asum. Thordak? What if we go mess up something on the edge of Emon, and then we're like, "Yeah! Fuck you!" And then we take off. Or like bamf back. Yeah, to balance that out. Is it a bit of a practice round if we go to the Fire Plane? Let's say we get there and it's a total shit show, right? Nothing but death waiting for us. We change our mind, we leave. But at least we see where Thordak's been all this time. Yeah. Just give it a look-see. Yeah! I've got a timeshare there. It will be killer. True. It's just a "myth," though, right? And that was probably written a long time ago which means shit could have totally changed. Never tell me the odds! All right, Vax. Do you have a suggestion in place, then? I'm okay with that, but how do we get in touch with her? Let's go to a different plane. Vorugal? Aye! No, that was four. They're pansies and won't say anything with their voice. Let's go! Even if it sucks, we can just come right back. Right. No. Cows eat hay. Do we hold hands again? Yeah, yeah. I am a big fan of the tour guide. Let's hoof it. I need to stretch my legs anyway. Told you. I put Pike on my shoulders because I'm getting ready for my Rocky training montage. Let's do it. I mean, everything we do is, right? I mean every time we've faced a dragon, we go find another Vestige. It feels like the rhythm is right on this. Let's go! We're alive! High-five, Scanlan! Yeah, she'll figure it out. And we've got an amazing tour guide. It's set up for us. Can't fail. 0% APR. Yeah. I'm good with that. I mean you'll take us there, right? You'll give us a couple of warnings, maybe point at something if it's terrible, and then you've got to go because it's going to mess with you? Now why is that, like you've got feelings about it? Or you're afraid of it? Or you'll be powerless there? Powerless? You've been before? We're good. Speak for yourself. Pull the trigger, travel agent. Yeah, I'm standing there with my eyes closed and my hands out. I'm showing my willingness to go. Sure! I chose @couple_cosplay for his white, muscular version of Grog. Grog got abs, y'all. (cheering) (singing) Take my breath away... (a capella version of Take My Breath Away) Hook it up! Nobody's with you. Before we go any farther, if we want to pull the ripcord, what does that look like? Yeah. One minute. No, I'm making sure that we're not like, "Oh, we've got to go! Oh shit!" But we all got to be touching? Okay. "Duck, duck, goose" means it's playtime. Yeah. I got this, you guys. 12. 12. Yes, let's parlay. Only one should talk. Oh shit, you're doing it. Oh, I love you. Who are you and what have you done with Vex? We pick up the dragon parts and we move into the city. We go to the front door, we do it once, go to the middle, we do it again. Totally covered. Fuck. We got to go find-- No, it's a trophy. It's too valuable to be in a pub. It's on somebody's wall as a trophy. Should we get some jail tattoos before we continue? 19. Keep walking. Let's keep walking and see what we see. I don't think so. I don't think I've ever seen one. I bet I can pick it out, though, if it's giant and it's made of fire. In the air? Fawkes! I think we're cattle. I'm going to lag. I'm going to drop another 20 feet back from the group. What? I can't hear you. 17. Hey! And I smash the Titanstone Knuckles together and I cast Enlarge. So are they keeping pace with me, or are they standing next to me? Yeah! Hi! (exclaims) Just trying to be even simpler than I am. Maybe then they won't want me. Oh, no. Oh! Do it. Tell them that we've got to meet our owner. Usher! Usher from 1999! But he's not a humanoid. I'm going to trip and fall flat down onto the ground. Is anyone else in this alley? Can I pop up, grab Pike, and start running after Keyleth? And I'm hoping that as we get towards the door I can shrink back down to go through any doorway that they're headed towards. Good deal. I'll snag Keyleth, too. I've got them both. Could we close the door? Are there any windows or anything? It was Pike! Who does? It was really hard not to fight, man. I do terrible when I don't fight. Okay! Yeah, how will you keep us from being harassed in the streets? You son of a bitch. I'm up, too. I go put the chains on, as well. Please? Did the people that have the people in chains, are they wearing the white robes and stuff? Good to have you back, man!
