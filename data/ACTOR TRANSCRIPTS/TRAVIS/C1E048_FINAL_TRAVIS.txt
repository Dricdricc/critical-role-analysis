Yeah, we do. Also ale. Aren't taxes due that day? Satellites can see it? Premium, premium, premium. That fucking Rogue One trailer! Holy shit! All right. No words. No words. No words! Yeah. All the things. Oh, on the break! On the break, on the break. What, you don't just make this stuff up as you go? Well done. Well done, legion. It's either going to be there tomorrow or very soon. Now we go to our deaths. Can we float closer? That whole description, and yes, we're still mists. Well, those that give a fuck, speak up. Then like (hissing) in a direction. Tall grass? Low grass? Yeah, we go. What are we stopped for? Are we here? Oh, really? Hey, Scanlan. If we go over there and it gets a little hairy, you've still got old magic door, right? Hugh Hefner house! Magic doll if you have it, too, for later, but yeah. Yeah, I'm sure it is. Super late. Yeah, and if they're from Westruun-- Yeah, Pike and I are from Westruun. If they're of that village, or that city, I'd like to make sure they're all right. Grandfather Wilhelm. Yeah! You're good for it. You're rich. Yeah. We become "Vox Machina Coyotes." Smile upon us, dice gods! Like gently, or like-- Like (sweetly) "Please leave." or like (angry) "Get the fuck out!" That is very noble of you. I will join him in this charity. That could be fun. No, twins. I'll roll this big bastard. "There's no (grumbles)" Come on. What? "That's not it at all." (chuckles) Oh, did he have the tower with the magical items? He let us pick something. We go in. Hey, hey, that's not necessary. We're friends. No, we're not looking for food. We're here to provide aid if we can, if it's in need, if people need our help. Oh, shit. Ten. I mean, it's really not necessary. Even if you were to loose those, it would just be a tickle. I mean, trust me, we come from Westruun, all right? Yeah. Winter's Crest festival? Grog? Pike? Wilhelm? Right? I'm as psyched about all this-- (inhales) Right. Yeah, yeah, understandable. Right. We just actually came from Westruun. It seems to be a bit occupied at the moment. No, I, listen. It came about my own. I just got the genetics for it. (stage-whispers) Would you shut up? (softly) Who's Cornelius? Never heard of him. No. No, I'm sorry, I don't know who you are. Understandable. How many do you have here, in your encampment with you? I like him. (laughter) If I could be selfish for a moment. Have you seen Wilhand? Pike, Pike Trickfoot. Her grandfather. Fine. Thought I'd ask. I wouldn't mind a good stretch. Check the corners. Yeah, we promise you no one will bother you tonight. No, I don't need to sleep tonight. I'll be on the watch. There's only 60 people. I feel like he'd know with 60. That's like this many, like-- Yeah. Yeah, me too. Really? Great. We take the night, then. Holy shit, what the fuck just happened? Okay, Scanlan. Scanlan. Very attentive. No. Big watch, big watch. Nine! Why did you pick that as the word? Outstanding. Blood trickles out of the ear from the brain trauma. (laughter) Glad you let us in, aren't you? Whispers! Oh, you know, just in case we mention where we might be looking for them, in front of these people. I run over and I pick up Pike and I spin her around in a big bear hug. Oh, my little buddy Pike. We missed you. Pretty fucking far. We will make our way into the city, and when we do, we will look for your items. Always do it, right? Thank you. Drez Vina, it hasn't been a pleasure, nice to see you. And can I take Pike around the shoulder and lead her out of the tent? Hey, hey... hey, Pike? So I'm glad things have been good at Whitestone. They've been good, yeah? Yeah, we miss you a whole lot. Listen, I've got some rough news, actually. We made it back to Westruun, and the city has kind of been ransacked and overtaken. It was attacked by a bunch of dragons, and what's worse is that after it was attacked-- you know that herd of wandering goliaths that left me for dead in the woods? Yeah, they've kind of taken control of the city, and I think that's my family that's in there. Yeah. Look, we wanted to go in, I wanted to look for Wilhand, but we haven't done it yet, and-- I don't know. Some of us went in via mist and they haven't seen him, but they don't really know what he looks like. The place looks pretty rough, he's not here in this little encampment. I'm not really sure where he is. Yeah, I want to, but like, listen. I'm afraid to put everybody in the group in jeopardy. They're going to be there, in the city, and I was wondering what you might think about going to look for a few other more Vestiges, trying to find Osysa's mate and seeing if we can find anything that can help us, because it's going to be a fight, right? And you know me I fucking love a fight, but-- Yeah, it's a lot. Yeah, you think so? I missed you so much! And I cry a little bit into my beard, and I wipe it away I'm like Oh! The pollen out in these fields is awful! (laughter) (crying) It's raining! (laughter) All right. Actually, Pike. I've been holding on to something, and I think you might like it. I have these Gauntlets of Ogre Power, and I can't wear them anymore, because I got some new stuff, and if you wear it, your strength score goes up to 19. Do you want them? You have to attune to them. I think they might shrink. I don't know, though. Isn't it like a French dish? All right, and I give Pike the Gauntlets of Ogre Power. Yeah, and I go to give her a fist bump. Holy shit. Nice, Pike! Right, so now we have all our stuff. Should we make our way towards that area they said that the orc raiders were coming from? What is the weather like outside? Cold, snowy on the ground? I still have mine. Let's go. Come on, man, let's just hoof it. Oh, that's fucked up. Take a walk. Save a horse. Coming to the Geek and Sundry store. Graffiti as we go. Nine! What about cows? We've got stuff to do. Say it. Say it! I'm just applauding. Again! Again! I pick up my chicken and I throw it at Scanlan. Hopefully. Shit. It's actually quite nice out here. This is like spring for me. Yeah, we're pretty cool. Two. What do you see? Yeah? So? Yeah. Let me check if it's safe to move on. And I reach down and scoop up a handful of snow, right? Just snow? How's it taste? Shit's crazy pure, yo. Yeah, we're good. Let's go check out the scary obelisk. I'm moving ahead. Who wants to come with me to the obelisk? For what? Why are you hiding? There's nobody out here. Do you guys want a ride? I pick up each gnome on my shoulders. No problem! It's a two, minus three. Awesome. What the fuck. Natural one. Is it made of, it's stone? Hey, Scanlan, I heard if you touch your tongue to something like this, it'll stick. Why not? I don't see what the problem is. [break] Can I hold my hand up to the obelisk and just feel if there's any, like, heat radiating off of it? Man, somebody does not like sculptures. No, it's art, I get it. It's like, interpretations and it seems whimsical-- Where is she going? Fuck you. Feral Instinct's screwing me up. Percy? 11. Yeah. Welcome back, Pike! Laser pointer. Yes! I would like to avert my gaze, and go into an averted-gaze rage! (growls) (laughter) I'm using my Feral-- no, that's wrong. I'm using my... what the fuck is it called? I've totally forgotten what's it called. What the fuck is it? Reckless Attack! Yes. So can I cancel out the disadvantage and get just a normal roll? Yes! And Great Weapon Master on these two strikes. Shit! Nine. (yells) (laughs) Shit! Nope. I'm so mad that I come out of my rage because I don't hit anything, right? Well, I've been swinging. Misses. Like putting yourself at the mouth of a cannon. I rolled a 16. Yeah. That Fireball, I think it might have pissed them off. Should we say Ioun in Elvish? What's in the hole? Can I run over and play golf? Nah. 22. Reckless and Great Weapon Master. That's a natural 20. I'll take that one on the first one. 19. 20. 31? No, that's just the attack. Before the modifier? It was 12 before the modifier. Which is 32, plus ten is 42. Nope. 17. That's just the first hit. Happy Gilmore-style. Seven, 12, 20, 30, on the second one. I dip the tip of the sword into the little well and I pick up the head. Yeah, put it in Vex's little refrigerator Bag of Holding. Has anybody put their hand in the hole yet? All right, I put my hand in the hole. No, the triangle. 19! Just lick your finger and stick it in the wind. Yep, redemption. We take off at a jog now! Let's not. Do we want to check the other building ruins? We didn't check those at all. There's a whole corner of a building over there. Well, go check it! What the hot holy fuck. I got it! I got it! I start catching it with the sword. Good! Splash on! Yes! That's kind of fucking hilarious. C'mon, Deadpool hand. Nope! No, no, that's just part of a-- It was a statue garden, it's not a big deal. It's just a fragment. Is he on the ground still? Which hand does he have, his left? Are you right-handed? Thank gods for that. No. Also eaten alive, burned, shot, stabbed-- -- pulled apart, maimed-- -- Lacerated. But that's just in the mornings. We're heading up the mountain. Are you sure? We could always use you as a decoy-- I mean, as an aid. Do you need a hand finding your way to the encampment? Is this as far as you got, or did you make it up the mountain previously? Oh, you've been up there already? Oh, man. Why you didn't say so? We could really use your help here. Did you go in any of them? Right. Well, look, you don't really seem to have a lot on you. Why don't you join us for just a little bit, to the areas that he knows, and then we'll send you back on your way, maybe with a bit of ale, a little bit of food? Maybe a weapon? Well, listen, I'll walk with you. Lead the way. Yeah, Vex'ahlia will point where we're headed. Do you always ask questions to which you know the answer already? Hey, Pikey! Tank up in this motherfucker. She's coming, she's coming. And don't miss the 50th. Nothing. Just us.
