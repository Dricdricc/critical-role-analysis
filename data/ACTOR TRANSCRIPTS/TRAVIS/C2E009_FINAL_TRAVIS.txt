We're all a bunch of assholes! Yes! I feel like that was Masterpiece Theatre all at once. We spring forward. Beat to shit Vax on the front! It's fucking awesome! Oh, gross, really? Think about the Europes and the other places that are asleeps. Hey, it's okay, baby. It's okay. I know. (pretend cries) You want some pickle juice? Panels and autographs. We loved the critters that came out to Seattle. Chicago, it's time to represent. Roll a d20 real quick, just for that. Give them the old evil eye? Come on, first roll of the night. Dick whistle. Yeah. I figure we want some drinks and food, yeah? Or you could eat first; we've been traveling-- Sir, can I bother you for a second? He's busy. (whistles) Who's that? Yeah, can we just grab any booth or table that's available? We're looking for some food and drink this evening. I think a tab. Yeah? Three rooms. Any other half-orcs in this bar? Not-all-there mustache. We just can't have a fucking peaceful drink, can we? Just got to get right into shit. Okay. Jesus! In one game? Oh no. She wants to play again, right now. What? I said you want to play again, don't you? Yeah Laura's dying on the inside. I agree with you 100%. Molly, come on now. Sheed or Sheen? Yeah, go get her, Molly. That was very effective. Right. I wonder where her office is. Nott has to roleplay every meal. Anybody feel like going up and giving ole Claudia a door rap, at her office? No. Wow, y'all. It works. Yeah, we'd like to avoid entanglements with the law, being so new and all. Maybe it might be wise to ask any particular groups to avoid while we're here. We're slightly aware. Well, they frown-- Yeah, getting the good shit right now. Are there any particular groups of people that are responsible for unsavory business in the city? Any identifying clothing or memorabilia they might have on them? No, just perhaps to keep an eye out for in case we sought employment from the wrong type. Head tutor, you said? Jester, now, that doesn't seem to cover who you're looking for, though. Job postings. Anywhere we might go to-- Well, thank you for your time. I think we'll find our way back down to the belly of this tavern. Xerox! Just right out in the open, huh? As we're heading down, I lean over to Beau. The two of us are going. I lean over to Beau and I say I don't know if you're aware of it, but when you compliment people it sounds like a fucking insult. Is that intentional? It was just an observation. Like commenting on the office window? You've gotta put more smile-- It didn't quite sound that way. Yeah. Just something to put in your hat. Yeah, go for it. Yeah, so let's start with maybe a little smile on the face. That's always a good starting point. Try again. Oh man, you look constipated. You ever winked at anybody? We'll keep workshopping it. I've been around you long enough that I can tell you were actually trying to be nice. Apologies. We don't mean to intrude. We're new to this city. We just heard that some higher thinkers were going to be meeting down here. We hoped we might be able to join you. I'm afraid my list is not that long, unfortunately. We seek knowledge. Tearing at our heart. It's an ache. Preach on. Fjord. We understand. Thank you for sharing with us. We stay down. Yeah. Really appreciate what you said. It struck a chord. It mirrors a lot of what we've seen since we've been here. Do you meet very often? I'd love to come back. Yeah, personal. Emotional. Yeah. We'll check in with-- what was her name? Yeah. We'll check in with Claudia if there's any other meetings. Again, appreciate you being so open. What's in the cellar? I just want to know. Is it munitions? Is it meat? Is it booze? Talk about an underbelly. That was more than I was expecting. Right upfront. No. I mean, I would say the same thing if I was taking such a chance with people I didn't know, right? I think he's just trying to invest in us a little. Seemed nice. (suppressing a sneeze) Let's go back up. Fuck it. Jester, don't believe what you hear. It was a huge orgy. Just naked parts everywhere. I know. Maple syrup. They had little Tic Tacs and all sorts of chocolate chips. Lollipops galore. Tongue bath. Yeah, it is. The only problem with that would be we were in that meeting at well. It's a smaller group. That's right. Yeah. It's a good nickname. Beau. Beauregard. I think we're probably good to retire. Yeah, because we're fucking spies! Beau knows grumpy. (laughter) Passive sports marketing campaign check! Mm-hmm. Molly, do you need to pray over your swords? I don't know how often-- Oh. Well next time, could you include me in it? I don't know if maybe it would help me with my skills. I appreciate that. Peeping tom! He's the DM. Okay, gotcha. Six gold. So far. One gold each. How did your homework go last night? Hey, that's great! Nicely done. That's the garrison area? Gotcha. Garrison's more east, you said. Did you say, "Get that smut?" Just making sure. So we're going to the blacksmith. Then we're getting Molly a bath. And you. And then are we looking for job postings? Like, maybe some work? Is it like a fancy thing? Is it expensive? Are you doing this? Yeah, fair enough. That is true. The syphilis itch? Yeah, yeah, he could check you out. Give your crotch the old once over. Amazing! Although, I mean, credit would help our, you know, reputation. Jester, any interest in chasing down that guy and seeing where the news is gathered? Maybe they could print a retraction. Or where it comes from? You look like me? But Fjord does accents. Yeah, of course. Not to alarm you, I only meant that if we are going to be paid for our escapades, a reputation, anonymously, might help, if we belong to that name. No. MARISHA. Yeah. Do you want to be about something? That's not true. Caleb, I'm sorry. If we put you at unease, that was not our intention. "Look at you" is always the worst. Look at you! Yeah. I'm down for it, too. Molly, I expect you to lead this escapade. Please, lead on. Five steps in a circle. Do you still look like me? Are they in the bag? Yeah. Lodge of the Eclipse? I'm good. At the outside? If it's on the way sure. Oh, the postings, yeah. What was it? The King's Hall. Where the Herald of the Hall is. Where we can get that retraction. Yeah, that's cool. Enthusiasm, Beau, enthusiasm. Come on, work on what we did, come on. Just try, give it a whirl. (whispering) Yeah! Baby steps. Oh shit. Sure is pretty. (laughing) What is it? Is she still with one of the--? Yeah, killed the baby and false imprisonment for the kids. Oh shit. Don't let her get away with that. Are we all hanging back? I'll walk up with Caleb. Fjord Junior. Oh wow. Like a tiny little Fiesta. Yeah, I was going to say the same. Oh shit. Cops. No, look, come on. They confided in us. The last thing we should do is turn on that just for a simple coin. I personally enjoyed the last beast that we slayed, but I think that we have plenty to discuss in that warm bath you're talking about. Can you put your thumbs in your pocket and give a little waddle? You look right on, right there. Give a little spit, so people know you're coming. (tinging) Good to know. Quite reasonable. He's all clean right now. Pumat Sol cleaned him up. I'd like to have my clothes cleaned, yes. (elderly voice) My anniversary! In the hot tub?! Beast mode! Oh man. You come to these places a lot? I've never been. She knows a lot about dicks, remember? We're looking to get in some-- Yeah. We've got the head of a manticore out on our cart. Melting in the sun. Not too much, Caleb. It's all right. Not too much. That's less than a handful. Not even worth mentioning at all. Actually, that's not correct. I thought it was "no." Well, we've lost Caleb. Should we discuss the potential job offers that we've collected? I agree. I am also not looking to attract any attention. Well, we can certainly teach you. Yeah. It's very shallow here. Very little risk. We're not going to do that. She vomits up a popsicle into the pool. Yeah! So here's what we got. We got "gold from 'My-riad' activity?" Myriad activity. Whatever that is. We got "reward for rebel gatherings." Which we are not going to do. We've got "tracking down heretical god worship." I don't think we're feeling that one, right? Yeah. Apparently there are only six deities they allow to be worshipped publicly here. The Allhammer, the Raven Queen, the-- We also got, apparently, Winestacker. Wang stacker? Yeah, he had something, at the Morrow Keep? Yeah, we're not going to do that. But there is a roving beast, which feel like falls into our wheelhouse. If you're not planning on bouncing tout suite, might be a fair way to find our way in the town. Yep, we really did. Apparently Jester's mother's going to hook it up, right? Hey, Nott, now the next step is to get your head underwater. Okay, we're going to take a big breath. Beau and I will hold you, and on the count of three, we're going to go under. TRAVIS and We all go underwater with Nott. TRAVIS, MARISHA, and And we bring him back up. (shushing) Hey, you did great! You did great. You're going to get a sticker. It didn't burn, right? You lived. Great job. Nobody's chasing after you or giving you any heat, are they? Which one? I am lying! Jester! I understand the Stormlord is to be feared and respected. Wow, Beau. Really? We are very glad that you're back. Which means a lot, Molly. Molly, what else do you do around a hot bath-spa-place? Uh-huh. Jester-- I forgot what I was going to say. This is normal, right? No, I know, it just seems to be happening faster than before. It's all fragrant and stuff. Oh no, oh no. Jester, help. (fake drowning noises) I think so. We take it to the Herald of the Hall. We met a guy named Shak√§ste, he was super cool. White afro, really awesome. He said "baby" a lot. But in a charming way. I gather my clothing away from Jester. Come on, "son." You all just sit on opposite sides. Should we catch you outside, then? Maybe they need more hot water, we'll send some in on our way out. I'm real down for that showdown. Perving on Yasha. Will you be gone for a while, or is it a quick errand? We'll see you back over here, then? Okay. Hug around the arms that are down, and you're like-- We'll see you back at the King's Hall. Is there a desk, or a clerk? I'll walk up to one of the king's guard, ask him. We're here to inquire about one of the postings. There's a roving beast that needs taking care of. That's right. We're a few members of the group known as the Mighty Nein. We would like to take one of those listings off your hand, if we could. The one mentioning that roving beast. Seems about our speed. Yeah, I'm Philbin. Yeah, fucker. The head-shake afterward is the best Is it a minus? Yeah, that's fair. What are those other two called? I forget. (laughing) Karen. Just to be clear, there's no clearage of sewage? We're just here to take care of whatever's causing that webbing you mentioned. Proof of-- okay. Mighty obliged, we'll take care of this most expediently. Declining it? For any specific reason or did they just change their mind? Good day to you. We'll take care of this. And we leave. Yeah? Shak√§ste. That's not really our problem. Beau does have a good point, though. I mean, if we get down there and it's some world-ending monster-- I head to the outside and wait out by the posting where we last saw Caleb and Jester. (explosion) You kicked his cat until it burst! He kicked his cat so hard! TRAVIS and You guys, I kicked this cat today, and it fucking evaporated. (laughter) Somebody punch me. (punching sound) Disguise Self? Yeah, he's gone. It's got to be locked up-- Skip away? Or to a Banana Republic, maybe? (laughter) Yeah! Anarchy! Hey-- oh. Fitting, absolutely fitting. We'll take it. We're going to the outer wall of the Tri-Spire. Maybe a late lunch, carb up, and then let's fucking-- Abandoning expectations! Yasha! We got to figure out how to get rid of the Disguise Self blockage, that's a big-- What caused that? Plus, there are sewers. Smut you shall have!
