A present? Okay, kill him. First roll of the night. First roll of the night. Probably those eight miles you rode. What does Underdark sound like, by the way? (all laugh) Mm, no! That sounds real pretty. Ooh. Well. We can lock him up. And then kill him. No. I go over and pick up his warhammer and say, you may-- maybe-- leave. But I get to keep this as a souvenir. I like that idea. Butt naked. Why? Smart, smart! Yeah. And you have to get naked. What? Thank you. Do you wanna handcuff him? Oh good, yeah. Can't we have Scanlan turn him into a porpoise? I don't think so. No, that's mine. As a token to remember you by. No, it's great. You can really argue all you want to, or I'll just smash your fucking head in. You dicks. (high-pitched) I want the hammer! And I'm throwing my ax at him with the chain of returning as well. 17. 17. 15. Yeah. Should've left the hammer. I guess you should've left the hammer, shouldn't you? I would like to pick up the hammer. Right. Me, I'm just an appetizer. Okay. 11 sets of armor, okay. Can you do a magical check on the-- Oh, he's got it. Ooh! The heavy plate armor has resistance to fire damage. The warhammer-- Clarota is Dracula. I'm raising my hand. Can I harvest any natural armor from the bulette? The kitty? All right, yes, I start butchering, or something, the bulette. All right. Shit. You can go on my back. Yeah, and I pick up Scanlan under my arm. I am? I thought we were all-- Okay. Yep, I'm flying. He's been raging. Oh, awesome. That helped. Natural? Oh. 19. Natural 20. Take me instead. Yeah, come on. 18. (high-pitched) Oh no. Leave him. Oh shit, really? Are you paying attention? She's not an eagle anymore. Are we over the war camp, or are we over the-- Yay! I begin to fart to slow the fall. Wait, before, you gotta get to me first, because it will slow you too much. Gotta get to me first, motherfucker. Yeah. Big things go down. It's like Gravity. Thank God it's not me. 18. You're gonna be like an ACME cartoon and just leave a (pff) LAURA and I rolled an 18. Well, I was very graceful on the way down. Thank you. Nope. Are we near their big war machines? How about-- I'll give him a level three potion and you go heal Scanlan. 39. She's doing a Mass Healing-- A death saving throw? Oh shit! I'm taking a level two potion, myself. Just-- Dude! Kick that shit. Yes. Ugh, that's huge. Come on Squidworth, over here! I take off and run to him. Whatever we do from here, I sprinkle dust of tracelessness behind us the whole time like a fucking flower girl. (all laugh) What? Yeah, I do have a cask, actually. Right. I'll-- There you are. I go and hold his shoulders-- -- whilst she tries to heal him, just in case he gets all sucky on her. Oh. That's much less-- Hey! I got it (snap)! I'll do the breaking part. So? Zero. Right. I pick up Clarota. Yeah, why not. I pick up Clarota and we start running balls. Well, how about I put one arm under his face and help him. Which one's the left one? Let's split up! I think we get to pick one here. With haste! Hey, flower girl! I pull out a torch. Will you light my torch? Nice. (all laugh) I take off running to the left. Running! Running to the left. (maniacal laugh) Hah. Hodor. What? I'm fast. No, no, no. I mean. A leisurely jog. Maybe we could do a cave-in. Yeah, but it'd be fun. Not necessarily. Thank you! They do call me 'Grog the Locksmith.' They don't call me that. Oh, I can too! I have two firewood bundles. She had babies. Oh. Thank you! Bag of holding, bag of holding. Let's go that way, or are we resting? I'll stay awake. Yeah. I've got two firewood bundles in the bag of Ikea holding. Then, no? (all laugh) I wanna burn something. Is there anything made of wood down here? I want to set it on fire. I wanted to pyro shit. Ooh! Can you make me an explosive axe? Why? Up. Oh. Like, the ceiling? Or-- Yep. Lay low. Let them come. Keep sleeping and shut up! Oh. Fine. Wake her up. I stealth as well. Fuck yeah! A two! 17. Yeah. Wake up your sister. It was just us boys-- -- and then you woke her up. What. You? Oh, she was actually awake. She dreamed, in the dream she was still awake. So the three of us are up. Oh no, that was a bad expression! No! It's balls-ass dark! Good thing we didn't make a campfire! Well, maybe just leave it there. And liked it. I'll take one more level two potion right now. One more level two potion. Oh, do I get to hit things? My god. And just to try it out, I would like bring out the flaming hammer of-- Yeah. 23. With the hammer. Yay, you loosened it up for me. Yeah, we're going down. (fart sounds) Commune. What more do you see? Well, that's good. Oh, good. I would like to trip Vax. (all laugh) As he's walking. Yes! 24! Suck it, elf. Yes! What, what happened? What happened? Did you not stealth past that little pebble? Yeah? Oh, I'm so happy right now. That's all I wanted. Yeah. Obsidian, maybe? I mean, whatever that is. Oh god. (all groan) You got bitch-slapped. (high-pitched voice) I hate puns. Do I need to take off running again? We can go-- I've got an earring? Ah, let me play. Please. Shit. I'm raging. I raged. Well, you know, when the ladies call my name. Wow. Last time I tried to do somebody to something, I did it to myself, so. Oh, shit. What's in the cart? I farted when I rolled, I rolled a 9. Oh, shit, really? So, like, 200 pounds. MATT and Do you wanna talk to the other one, since-- Big squishy ogre. I like it. Yes! Where's your pointer? No. Yeah. Oh shit. So go wrestle it? It's mine! Don't attack it? What? Oh good, yeah, thank you. It's an eight, right? Oh, shit balls. It's like his character move. Action figure Vax'ahlia. Sorry. Vax'ildan. The signature reach-around move! Kill it. Oh no. 15 hits. Let's just take it. That's what it's called? Right, I would like to pull the flaming hammer out of the bag of holding. And I would like to run at the-- this little-- this guy. What? I forgot there was an insect cloud. Oh, because there are bodies in the way? Then if that's as far as I can get, I would like to take the hooded lantern I have out of the bag of holding and throw it-- Yes! Yes, with the flaming hammer. -- activating the flaming properties of rage, and urine, and death. We'll see. Raging, raging, rage. Just regular rage. Yeah. 19. And 12. Awesome. And this is a 1d-- Yeah. 1d10. That can't be right. 1d10? Is this the right dice? It's a 30. I was like, 30! Yeah. Seven. Oh, four. And plus seven for rage. Plus two for rage. Yeah. Oh, it's-- to the greataxe is seven when I'm raging. Okay. Is that a 1d10 also? 1d10? Yep, yep. 1d6. Five. Oh, Jesus. Seven. Three. Oh, shit. Up close sucks. I'm pretty low. No, I'm fine. Come to me, woodland creatures. That will hit. That'll hit, too. You broke in their glass casket. Okay. Okay. Oh, halved. Both of those? Awesome. That's gross. No, I'm not. 14. Okay, so little piles of shit have got huevos. That's me, all smart with the fire hammer. It certainly did something. Yeah, right. Oh, shit. Balls. Ah, not an umber hulk. We're in big trouble. Hits. Misses. He starts sinking into the pool of lava? Yes. Yeah! Yeah, come on, Scanlan! Do it! What are you looking for? Yeah, boy. Perce! Wow! Get on it, nasty. Yeah! Yeah. I buy kerplash. A boot? Thank you! Right, yeah. I would like to come out of my rage. For the first time ever. What do you-- where do you wanna go? Towards Keyleth or toward the-- Okay. I'd like to pick up Pike and run balls over this way. Right towards this area. Well, yeah, look. It nearly killed me the one time I hit it. Okay. Right. Do you want to stay? It doesn't really matter. You want to stay over there? You know what? I'll-- Do you just wanna stay? I'll leave Pike where she is and I'll run up and flank Iceberg Lobsterface. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Unconscious! You guys are dicks. All right, Clarence! Yes! A B A B N. He's making trouble. Eff him up, Scanlan. Yeah, buddy. Amazing. I did a pretty decent job, actually. Thank you! Ah! Did I kill it? I put my hand in my pizza! (all laugh) Aha! Tell me more! (snores) (all laugh) Thank you, Pike. Hell yeah. (growling noises) It's a language we speak. That's really funny. Keep going. Oh, it's like hides and leathers and-- Yep. Son of a-- Well, you're welcome, ladies! (sings) It's time for a show! They're dwarves. You had two pairs of gloves? Kidding. It's Dumb & Dumber. Ooh!

Grog takes the top off and does a-- The things I'm gonna do in this armor, you're not going to want it back. Just give me and Scanlan one night to break it in, and I promise you, it will be mine. Well, uh, you know what I mean. Who am I talking to? Did we search the ogres? I wanna take it. I am searching the ogres, and I keep the 24 gold, but I give two to Vax. You're welcome. And two to Pike for healing me. You take a poo on the black puddle of acid? I'd like to take a hit dice. You're going to get your bear killed. It was a warp tube. And I got naked, too. We make amazing decisions. (all laugh) Sons of bitches. (sings) Why can't we be friends?
