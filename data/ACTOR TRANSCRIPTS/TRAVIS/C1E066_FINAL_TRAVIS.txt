Were they dressed up like they were from Marquet? Oh, really? Spice? Spice? Spice? I don't know what you mean, sir. Yes! Our week's amazing episode is brought to you by Loot Crate! And their theme for this month, the month of September, is Speed. They've got amazing, high-octane titles like Speed, Battlestar Galactica, Iron Man, Gone in 60 Seconds, Arrow, Batman, CW's The Flash, plus many more. I'm telling you, like that announcement.

You can get your hands on some of that sweet, nasty Loot Crate swag by going to www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole for $3 off your monthly subscription. You do it. You get it. And Goku's on the table. He stays-- He's got pointy hair. I like chewing on things! If it's not that, it's pen or pencils. I digress. Loot Crate, thank you! You can? They do? TALIESIN and Oh snap! Hold your badges up. How do you want to do this, Gilmore's Glorious Goods, the Slayer's Take. A one? This shit never ends. We already have ours because they're amazing. It's got like a raised CR too. Rep your CR love, we'll slap your hands. Like in a high five, not in a bad way. Like slap hands. My OCD wife will slaughter me. Negative. Beep-beep. And the Grand Maven took us up there? Oh, yeah, it's like a mixed bag. A little good, a little bad. It's mostly bad. Mostly. Thordak. No? Oh! But our Thordak, he has like this thing that is at the center of his chest right? It's like a jewel. And if you sliced his original maybe he upgraded. With respect, you were here centuries ago? Oh shit. I've got to get your diet sometime, that's amazing. Oh right. (stammers) Beep-beep. And we did recon on a third. It fell on our city, actually. Or hastily. Uh-oh. He's omnipotent! That was like the best sound cue ever. Oh good. Sam is here, somebody go get Sam! Sam's at the door. What? Man, you just got back in town! And a map? Some shit went down, he asked us-- I got you. 17. 17. That thing is huge. (singing) To the windows! Attaboy! Really? Spread. Out. We're over there, in front of the throne. You are kidding me. So is it fair to say that 16 points of damage didn't happen? It's time to wake up, boys and girls! So I would like to rage. Am I in front of the throne? That's me, right? That big, proud fuck over there? Can I run as far as my little feet can carry me, over in front of Percy and more towards along the wall? Yeah, that's cool. I'm cool with that. I'm not in front of that window, right? More in front of the wall? Okay, sweet. May I attach the Chain of Returning to my bloodaxe, and throw it at said giant bastard? 120 feet, on the Chain of Returning. Yes. No. Is that right? Oh shit, is it? I don't have it! We're a little rusty. Uh-huh. Chain of Returning! It doesn't say! It must be attached. Melee weapon. Thrown. Bonus action athletics strength check provided to pull the thing out. No distance. It's even laminated. Damn it. You know what? Since I'm raging, I take out the Javelin of Lightning and I'll throw that! That'll work. Oh, and I'll make it a reckless attack. That's good because that's a two. And that's a four. Yeah, but I've got a lot to-- no, it's not! Don't start with your juju. It's 18. That ends my turn. Oh no, he's reaching for something. That's a no. Least you fell in love before you died. (laughter) We're going to do drugs in your lounges for the rest of our lives. He said, show me what you can do. MARISHA and Amazing! Fuckles. Is that a d10 or a d12? "My free action!" Can I run, using a mixture of horizontal and diagonal movements, to run straight at Iron Giant? Yeah, I want to get right up on him. Can I put myself on the opposite side of him from the window? I would like to, since I have two attacks, I would like to try to shove him. He's only one size larger than me, so-- In an effort to show off our Vestiges of Divergence, I'd like to retcon this and smash my Knuckles together and use the Enlarge to grow to incredible size. Mighty Joe Young, bitch. Yes, a strength check against either his strength or dexterity, it's the target's choice. Yes, which I get advantage on. 23. Only five feet, or knock him prone. Yeah, I'd like to knock him-- I'd like to knock him prone. Amazing. Oh, I do? And because he's prone, does that give me-- no, I don't know. Reckless. I hit him with the axe! But I don't need it. Yeah, fuck, what did I say. Thank you, 22. Thank you, sir. My brain don't work so good. 19 plus one point of necrotic damage for 20 total. Yeah, you feel Grog. That ends my turn. You know Grog always leaves his mark, player. Don't say that so willy-nilly. I hate how confidently he's saying that. I have resistance to poison. It is an 18. Because of the belt of dwarvenkind. Okay. Okay, let's not! Okay? Let's not! Roll one of the good ones? Which one will it be, of the 90? No. One. 21! Holy shit! Just bring it. Yes! Great way to hear God laugh is to announce your plans. After seeing Vex fall and then Scanlan lift her up and then Vax get slammed into the wall and Keyleth showing up in this very attractive form, I would like to reckless attack, and for a bonus action, go into a frenzied rage for a third attack, and use all three to try and push him out the window. I have advantage. That's a 23. That is a good question. I could move. 27. Yes, please. That's good! 26. Because I love 300, I look at him and I say, (yelling) This. Is. Vox Machina! And kick him in the chest out the window. We're so high up. Fore! Do I have any movement to move away from the opening of the window, just in case any trickery happens? I find earth elemental Keyleth. (heavy hand slap) Yeah! Whack! It's like a jive hand shake, it's like, yeah! Get a little weasel. Yes! 23. I wave my giant hand that I've enlarged. Scanlan! Beep-beep. Beep-beep! You hear the Velcro. Neon pinks and purples. Percy, what's the proper way to leave a royal chamber? Thank you for having patience, put your head, and-- Thank you for your patience. And I turn around and walk out. (laughter) That was so good, too! Should we ask how to tell if someone else is a dragon? Is there a tell? Oh. Right. LAURA and Yeah, we all walk out. Just us, no Grand Maven? How high is the top of the tower? A few hundred feet up, I chucked the shit out of it. You know the needle in the desert metaphor? Well, I've heard it before. Many a wise and learned creature-- No, that's a seven, right? It'll be one dude impaled against the wall and some poor bastard that grabbed it and then got fucking electrocuted. There's two corpses. Yeah, that's where we're going. (loudly) Your drug deal? So cool. Are you supposed to do anything to set up for this deal? Can I ask for one other codeword if you don't want us to step in? What if you want us to create a distraction? Kill everything. How about "tomato paste" to create a distraction? Yeah, because I'll cover the walls in tomato paste. But from people. How far away is the casino? The north end? Should we wear costumes? Should I wear my big pointy hat? SAM and I put the pointy hat on. Didn't bring any extra clothes. We are adventurers. That will be soggy. It will be soggy in five minutes. Put that shit down! Put it down! Put that damn mug down! I'll tear that sticker. How dare you! I'm going to ruin this transaction for you now. I'm very rich, wealthy. I'm alone. I walk around double-fisting both bottles of the sandkheg. Just rolling in. Rolling in deep. Nope. (laughter) What? You're like the biggest felon of our group. Nope. Do you know if it's a powder, or a plant? Put it in your lip, put it in your lip! Up the nose? Chew on it. Chew on it! No, I'm hitting on ladies. You clearly do not know how rich I am as the Countess of Febreze. I own many magnificent horses. 15. Well, I am looking for a companion for the evening. I've had a great victory and I was hoping I might celebrate it with a fine lass like yourself. Yes, yes, I am the magister of Sh'breeze, and I have many steeds. A night with me would truly honor your lady fair. I reach out and I grab his shoulder. I say I'm so sorry, this amazing decorative piece on my head sometimes impedes my hearing. I take the hat off. What was it you called me? Oh, I asked for a woman, not dudes, no really, I just wanted one lady. Now, I'm not going to pay for this, really, I'm not. I'm very important! Kiki! Thank you. (belches) That's a good idea. What are you doing with it? Are you high? Aw, fuck it. I take a big old wad out of the thing and I stick a big old chunk in my lip. 16. This is really nice. Should I swallow it? All right, I swallow it. Can we free-base this shit? Trainspotting. This is Trainspotting. How's your butt feeling? He's foreseeing the Washington Redskins season. Yes. So like, should we sleep? Because I know we still wanted to see Headmaster James Kryon at the Crystal Chateau. Maybe he needs to be slapped sober. Mister Ashad? All right, I'm going to bed. Are you talking to yourself? We thought we might be going to the Crystal Chateau today. Anything to know about heading that direction? (cricket sounds) They snobs? Or are they like shifty? Yep, shall we? We buying more drugs today? Off to the Crystal Chateau, then? Yeah, they're snobby. Meep-meep. I bet they got this from Whitestone! I don't know, I just felt a little brain snap and then things danced between my ears and then it hit my mouth. What do I do with this? What'd you say? Do you want to put those in the bag of holding? Your cross to bear. Got it. Oh, yes. I got these Titanstone Knuckles off my uncle. They make me bigger and stronger, but I'm not sure what else they do. No, I'm not interested in selling it. Non-divine? Make sure to visit the Geek and Sundry store for all of our new merch items! We've got these new bitching bracelets! Well, I have a question. Would you ever engage in matters outside of this stupid-ass place? You know, other countries, people in danger, dragons. You seem to be a powerful magician of some sort. Would you ever help? Lot of answers we got here. Lot of answers. Maybe I should just ask him to identify this. He counted ten like this! I thought they were learned. Triceratops! Triceratops! All right, easy, killer, easy. The name of the Meat Man goes a long way. If we had more of that stuff from Percy's place, he'd be more willing to share. I can't imagine why. That's true, you're little drones! How about we go up to the woman, then, if the hole sounds like a bad idea? Come on, sneaky sneaker. He drank a bit last night. Vax, do you feel like we should be door-knockers instead of sneakers? 14. The thing that's about to eat you. Trapdoor? No, Keyleth. No. Can we look around the streets? What was the flash? Is anyone new on the streets or on the roofs above us? 16. I'm looking for treasures. Any treasures in the room? 18. How did she even know about this? Nice job, Matt! All right, okay, it's not real.
