It is never used. 19? That's a high AC. Because of the shield, right? That's two of them! That was tough. Where's Ripley? Me, as well. I grab Scanlan, and we're taking off after her out the door. Dude, what?! [break] Or attempting to kiss. No, Grog and Scanlan ran out of the room after Ripley. We're yelling out, Ripley! Fuck that. I yell anyway. We stop. I could stay down in that foyer. I do. Like, his head bits? Why can't we just set him on fire? Is there a fireplace in the room? So like zero-G. I'll just hang onto it. I'll just hold onto it. I drag Anders over to the fireplace. He doesn't quite fit, so I have to snap some joints. The manse? I've got Anders in the fireplace, and I light the Firebrand War Hammer with the magic word, bacon, and I hit it and set him on fire. Yeah, bacon. Did you not know that's what the word was? Percy. Can we get into the underground caverns from here? Let me see your neck. Do I see anything on her neck? Yeah, we took out the ammunition. Maybe don't do that. I was thinking the same thing. I can try and jog her memory. Are there sentries? Can we expect to find traps, lookouts? He's-- wait, what? How did you see him? Oh, you killed him? We're going into the cavern. Boom! 26. Natural 20. What the flipping fuck, man. And four 20s. 13. I feel like that was the red stones or something from before. Negative two. I see Vex looking around. Can I look for tracks as well? I'm proficient in survival, and I never use it. Natural 20! I swear to god. How many tombs are open around us? Should we check the tombs? 18. Just those three, right? Who are you? Yeah, would you touch my dice? What? Not unless I'm raging. Grog is batting for the other team. Four. Not us. Not the possessed ones, right? I still roll initiative? I'm possessed, though. Well, then it's good it was a one. Unless I have to roll with advantage. Two. Awesome. He's not here right now. What are you going to do? Does Cassandra have any-- Do your worst. Nice, dude. 13. Misses. Hits. 15. 17 to hit? Okay. Oh, that's not awesome. That's 17. That does. 24. 20 on the first. Oh, just the 20! Roll high, golden snitch. Do we roll something? I rolled an 18. Oh. 26. Yeah, get us. That's a 26. 23. The first one was a natural 20. 21. Kill Goliath. Can you conjure a keg of beer? 19. That hits. Okay. 11. 21 points? Oh, I have my turn? Okay. I turn and walk over to Keyleth. I'm going to swing my hammer at the middle of her chest. 15. Wow. 16. 21. "Percy!" And I run towards him. 25. 18? 17 for the first one. 19 for the second one. There was fire damage. Let's pass our-- That's a natural 20. That's actually the first time I've critted on this show. It does additional damage. I think so, because I've never doubled my dice. I know. 14. 18, so-- what was the first one? 18 and? (laughing) You're a nothing. You're a nobody! A mocking kill! I've got a lot of health potions. Yeah. Would you like one? Hit dice? Let's go. Yeah. Are we? Oh, is it mine? Oh, I'm the Thanksgiving playlist.
