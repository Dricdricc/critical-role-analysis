Also, Halo 5 is out this week, which Laura and I are in. It's amazing. It's some game. Takes place in outer space. It's like Candy Crush, but with more death. Said so casually. They will. It'll be Mark Wahlberg. Sucks to be first! That you know of. Yeah, come on. You can take a couple of hit points, right? (sings Jurassic Park theme) (others join in) No, you wouldn't. You got it. Go stick him! You're great! You're money. You're good. Maybe they didn't see you. Look, they're all dummies. They're just mannequins. Three hits. You're now a porcupine triceratops. Totally. Turn around and give it to them. You do have a tail. Because we're a bunch of slap-dicks, that's why! I like it. I'm so in love with you right now. Is Stinking Cloud methane-based? Unnecessarily. He could. We are the best planners. Ever. Just your hands and head are sticking over. I don't know if that house is cooked enough, man. It's like Duel of the Fates. On a burning rooftop in the rain. (laughing) Giant goliath and a gnome who spits fire. Just burn it. Maybe it's like a slide. You're welcome to try. I mean, ultimately, on foot sucks for him right now. All you've got to do is get away for this to be amazing. Where's the zombie stone giant now? The hatch is on fire? Beymaxed it. Dude, you were fucking Rambo just then. You were Scanlan Rambo. Do you have any red cloth you can tear off and tie around your forehead? That was outstanding. (laughter) Oh, they're in front of us? I'm already raging? I just fucking bust through, apeshit-style. Okay. I got advantage on the strength check, so it was a 26. Yes. Yeah, I go in. At least Trinket's behind me. 19. Yep. Yep. Yes. Yep. No. Yep. Yeah. Yep, that hits. No. Last one? Six. Okay. 38. 49. 18. Thanks to the Feral Instinct. Oh, shit. Distracted by what? If only Rambo Scanlan was here. (laughter) And they're all up on the second floor, right? Interesting. There's a lot of dead men up there. That's a neat trick. No. What's wrong with you? Half the 16, right? So, eight. (growls) I go into a frenzied rage and I use reckless attack, along with my great weapon master, and I turn that thing into a piece of goo with my war hammer. (laughter) Advantage on them. That's much better. That's 24? Oh, gotcha. Okay. Just the first one. Okay. 21? And 20. Yes. Okay. No. Yes. Okay. Okay. I forgot that part. Know your rules, kids. 21 for the first one. And 20 for the second one, and the third one misses, right? That's with the fire. That's it. No, I'm not going to move. Yep. Okay. Work that hand out a lot, do you? Misses. Misses. That's right, I did. Nay! Because I had advantage on mine. (laughs) It is very reckless. (sarcastically) Yay! Okay. Okay, 37 halved. Okay. 37. So, 15 total? Okay. 33. What's half of 33? Okay, I'm going to use my stone's endurance to get rid of that stank. Roll, plus my constitution. 16. 18? Okay. Okay. Could you get to a second-floor window? (angry noise) I have a little collar. Does that help at all? Yep. Is that halved? Sure. Got it. Isn't this a Grog buffet? It ended on the first attack, right? Oh, I thought his first bite was the first one. I'm using it every time. (laughter) (quietly) Oh, shitfuck. (louder) That's okay. That's okay! Copy that. Like making out with braces. That does hit. Am I still grappled? I'd like to try and break the grapple. 22. Awesome. Can I use my bonus action to try and grapple him back? I will attack, yeah. Just one, right? (whoosh) Okay. Fuck yes! 21? Awesome! And that is badass. Nine, 17. 22. 22 with the fire damage. I'm staying. Is Trinket still behind me? Yeah, no. I'll stay. Yep. Hits. Misses. Hits. Hits. Yep, so four out of the five. 18. 26. 39. Half. Okay. Janet. (laughs) Trinket got a natural 20? So sour it was sweet. I think it's Trinket's first kill. Sunlight that shit. Identify it. It's a vampire. What are you doing? We've got a ton of other people in the room, though. I'm up? Well, I can't get through the-- I mean, I don't know what the fuck-- What am I going to do to gas? Hit it? Can I start running up the motherfucking stairs and jump up like Vax did? He said to kill! Yeah! I'd like to do that. That's a 23. Yes. Oh, how many attacks do I get? Yay, I get all of them?! That's amazing. Yay! 22! Shit! 12. (laughing) Okay. 13. 17 for the first one. 15, and 17 again. Two plus two. Come at me, bro. Yep. Misses. Misses! Misses. Damn, I was almost Neo, just dodging all sorts of shit. Halved to seven? She said begrudgingly. A half-pull. Nope. Make it rain. Just go for it. I'm a fan of one-dollar bills. Do I have advantage-- I don't know. 20. That's good. Me. You took away my playmate! (laughs) "Can we loot the mist?" Come on, at least some coins falling? Is it me? (stuttering) Is it just a row of guys in front of me? I would like to hold my turn. Because if I stand in front of them, nobody can do anything to them. Nah, I'll hold. Whoever's next can go. I'll take my turn now. I leap over the banister with my war hammer high and jump down on the guy that's closest to me, bringing it down with a reckless attack and great weapon master. Okay. Okay, that's true. 13. 24. Amazing, that's 27. That's 26. Okay, not a problem. Ten, 19, 29 on the first one. (laughing) And 28 on the second one. (inarticulate war cry) Oh, I don't need it. That's 27. Oh, it's the same thing. It's 27. I know. I haven't critted in forever. That's 20, 30. Is he on his back? Right on the knee. Yes. They might be vampires. It is. It is. Got one guy left. Time to call the Sandman. Who's got questions for Peg-Leg over here? Greatest plan we've ever had. You were amazing. I hold my hammer over his other knee and I go, "Look, we can work on you one limb at a time, "or you can be very truthful and my friend can end it all very, very quickly." In? Or under? Anything you use to identify each other? Nicely done, Vax. Can I check his body?
