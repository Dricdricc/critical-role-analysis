Mass panic, it's no big deal. Hello, Pike! Oh hi, Pike! (laughter) MATT and It is delightful, isn't it? I don't know if they have any left but they might. I'm calm. Oh shit, okay. We got Briarwoods to kill. We don't know if we have any further to go from this crypt? Uncharted? I would like to take a vial of holy oil that I have out of the Bag of Holding and keep it in my hand. Just out, so I don't have to get it out. I have a shitload. I never really use them. I have two level awesome-- what are the biggest ones? I have two superior, one the top one, and five of the low ones. Okay then I have one of those. Oh boy, does everybody want a piece of this pie? (laughter) Nope. Give me something else. How could you have my back if it's on me? How about you let me flick you hard in the nads now and I'll give you a healing potion? Just a little one. I won't even rage or nothing. It'll just be a quick little tap on your walnut. Yes! I kneel down and I get right up to his bits. And like the second grader I am trying to write in cursive I have my tongue sticking out like-- and I shift from using the middle finger down to the ring finger because we're being nice. And I go for-- are you right-handed? I go for the left nut. (whack) Does he throw up? Yes! Is there a little cough? All right. I will give you one of the-- there's three different levels or just the two? I'll give you the greater. I give him a greater. And Percy. I like it when you turn into the giant cloud thing so you don't have to take a nutshot. Would you like a common or a greater? Yeah, okay. I give him two common. I have three commons, two greaters, and one superior. I'm a walking medicine cabinet. Will it wear off? Attunement. How long does that take? Should we take a short rest? We did? Can I attune to Boots of Levitation? I would like to. Yeah, we've got to divide and conquer this shit. If we can. Yeah, one thing. Do we want to take the battle to them down here? Or do we want to try and lure them outside? They saw through the disguise at the table back in Emon. Keyleth, come on, we've got to stay. I'm really disappointed, Keyleth. Yeah. Not a bad idea with Cass, but we'll see. I'll be in the front. Meat shield. I run over and I knock Vax out of the way and I pick up Pike and give her a big hug. Oh, Pike, I'm so glad to see you! What? Oh. No. (whispers) It's me. Vax is minus a hit point because I hit him in the nuts. Hah! Now we're definitely going to kick some ass. Yeah. Somebody tell Trinket. I have a question. How are we marking these traps? We're coming across a lot of these. If we need to make a quick escape, it might be a problem. In a hurry. Oh yeah. I'll help Trinket. I'll help Trinket. Just me. Yes! 21! Nope, 20 17! Heroes' Feast! I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder. (laughter) Nope. I have resistance against poison damage. I know. Of course. Please just do it. No, let him take it! Metal door, right? Before we go in, are there any bits of whitestone on the ground, like stuff in chunks or small pieces or is it pretty clean-ish? Scanlan, just shoot a lightning bolt in there. Question mark? Anyone want to go touch a wall? I have darkvision at a range of 60 feet. Can I see it? Oh man. The roof is flat, or is it coned? Whitestone ceiling? I say we smash it! After a good giggle. Go through it! We should try to remove one of the stones. Yeah, I do. Yeah? I just kinda want to walk across the room. I walk across the room. I adjust my amazing spectacles. Walking up to the door, does it look like I can get any purchase with my little finger-bits? I have a pickaxe that I picked up before we left. Can I swing it at the bottom and try and find some purchase under the door? Okay. 16? Shit. Fuck. Nine? Thinking? I am Captain Planet. No. I run over and touch a stone. Yeah. Anybody have any objections? I swing away. 19. 16. We're all in the glass. No, we're in a closed space. Might as well die one way or another. Oh yeah, I'm just (angry noises). Keep going. What about these jewels? The jewels! It was what lowered the glass. Break the jewels! Can I take a swing at the jewel that I was holding my hand over? Can I hit the fucking jewel? Can I try? 18. No fire damage, so 15. Can I hit the gem, please? Yeah, the same one I had before that cracked a little. 21. Yeah, same one I hit before. 15 again, no fire damage. Can Pike do something? Pike, do some cool shit! You have lightning. Are we going to kill ourselves if we do that? It could buy us more time if we get on it. About ten feet up? Can I run over there? I'd have to run through the acid? Yes, I would like to jump across, run over, and start swinging on that section. Can I do great weapon master and hit it three times? Yeah? Can you take some people with you? 13, 17, and 13. No, it was 15, 20, and 23 on the hits. That was the damage. I'm running over to the other gems. I'm running over to the gem. No, we're going to put our hands on the gem, right? Fuck you, gem! And I'm resistant. We're hitting gems, too. 17. Or your staff. Hit it! Can we lower a rope and get over the glass now that there's a little space? Yes. Up and over the wall? Purple Man. We've got to get out of this room. We'll be right back, Ashley. Oh. My. God. Does any of us see this besides him? You all right? Yeah. Let's. But you always have a choice. 26. The broken pieces of whitestone, are there any that are the size of two hands? Can I grab a big, two-handed piece and put it in the Bag of Holding? Ten. Is there cover? Can they see us if we can see them? Will anybody gain something back from a short rest that we really need, or do we need to go after them? What about you? Let's go. We're at the bottom of this pyramid. They're walking up to the top. Four sides to the pyramid? From the base of the pyramid, what would you say the base circumference of this ziggurat is? Is it half a mile around? Yeah, should we come up on different sides? We don't know what's up there. Oh, fuck. That's right. There are four sides. Who wants to come on my side? Okay. Three. Keyleth. Sure. (quietly) I would like to rage. (laughter) 15. Boon. MARISHA and She inspired him? Can they see me? I'm going to hold my turn. I'd like to put my back against the column. I'd take that turn now, if I could. I can't get to him now. I used my movement. LIAM and I'll use the Chain of Returning, with the holy oil on the war hammer. 27. 15 damage with the fire and the holy oil does an extra-- 16. That's a 21. (laughing) Slick! Cover. Flying Vex is pretty dope. (laughs) 11. That actually hits me. Halved, because I'm raging. 13? Who cares? Constitution. 16? As long as he's in that circle. I'd like to go into a frenzied rage, and I would like to see and swing away at Lord Briarwood. Well, he left. Cassandra's there. She would get an attack of opportunity, wouldn't she? I'm going to turn her into applesauce. Sorry. Not really sorry. 21. Same thing, 21. And a 14. 17. 24. 24 for the first one. And 22 for the second one. But she doesn't take any holy damage off of the oil on the thing, right? Yeah, I've been known to take a lady's breath away! (laughs) I'll stay where I am. He marked you? Two natural 20s in a row!? Every round. I don't think you are. So for the Boots of Levitation-- Is that Lord Briarwood? Okay. The Boots of Levitation. It says it requires an action to levitate? Could I do three attacks? Or just two, and then have the action left over? I'm already wearing them. Set it up? Yeah, fuck it. I'll take all three strikes at Lady Briarwood. That's good. 25? 17? I'll use that inspiration on that one. No, not on that one. The first and the second one missed. Jesus Christ. 20. 19. With advantage? A four. Yeah. Wait. I'm raging. Can I be charmed? (cheering) Intelligence of six. It takes a second! I like it! War God's Blessing? She has inspiration from you too, right? Everybody get their heads down, like Ashley. Fuck yeah, he is! Let them know, Pike! (laughing) Of course it is! Good line. Cassandra's still up, right? Oh, wait, are we slapping Vax? Let me try. Is Cassandra still there? Can I grab her by the neck and walk her to the edge of the pyramid? Why not? We do have manacles. I take some of the manacles, and I manacle her hands behind her back. And to be super shitty, I grab a length of rope and wrap it around her ankles and tie it back to her hands so she can't stand up. She's got to stay there when she wakes up. Can I pick up Sylas's onyx sword? Okay. I'll put it in the Bag of Holding. Yeah, I noticed. Do you want it? I'll give him the sword. He's got the onyx sword. Percy, get up the fucking rope. A real man could throw 80 feet. Percy, are you up there yet? The center of the pedestal. Plus, you're left-handed, and she apparently has things against lefties. You don't know. Let's say no. Her husband was a vampire. I'll go next. I think, if you kill her-- Here comes Godzilla. We don't know if she's unconscious or dead? Can I jump down, then? 18. I'd like to go straight for Vex. I'll pick her up and start running towards the door at the back of the room. What do the doors look like? I'll run to the door that's closest to us. What about the little penny? The dime? I'm at the top, so we can gently get her down. I could jump down with you. I'll jump and hold her. Once we hit the ground-- we're outside of the room, right? Should we try to heal her? I've got a common. Can I put a common? I have a common. Do something to that little ball. Who's still in there? Check on Lady Shithead. Here, you take your sister. I'll go back to the doors. I go back to the doors and try the doors. 19. Can I make my way over to Scanlan to go check on Lady Briarwood? We need to figure out what we're doing with the little black ball of universal death. Could we just leave it? Give it a poke. We're obviously not equipped. I'll grab Lady Briarwood and drag her out of the room towards the doors. Orcus? Bury it like the pharaohs of old? We can't kill her in here. She kept talking about a sacrifice. We can't kill her. I think she understood she had to give a life for it. And then you can bury it once we're out of the way. I drag her out of the room and toward the steps. Not yet. Not until we're out of here. Do you have to be there to do it? Well, let's all get to the point where it's not going to collapse on us. It's like three little acid vials. We all leave. So if you had rolled 76 points of necrotic damage?
