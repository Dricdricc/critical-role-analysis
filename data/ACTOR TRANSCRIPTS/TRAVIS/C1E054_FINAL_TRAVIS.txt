Stop masturbating during the announcements. (laughing) Yeah, that's right. And they've got a power crate coming out. They have an Infinity Gauntlet oven mitt. Absolutely. Yeah! If you're in Puerto Rico, come see us. We'll be there, totally sleep-deprived and bushy-tailed. It's a good one? We're excited to go. San Juan, baby. San Juan! Let's do this. (growls) This was not the plan, for the love of god help us! I don't like the way he said that. Why'd you have to say it like that? It's just a black dragon! You used the word 'somehow'. Cows have eight stomachs? Can I go up to some of the guards outside and say, oi. Where do you keep your prisoners, hostages, meat shields? I meant like the goliath, the Herd guards. Are there any still in there? Or are they all clear? Hm. All right, thank you. (whispers) What was Reginald's daughter's name? I'd like to make my way over to the Iron Stocks. I thought we knew her name. Reginald's daughter's name? Are you asking me? Can I walk up to the ledger and pretend to read it? Yep. Any squiggles that look familiar? Oh, this poor bastard right here, yep, I remember him, good chap. Hello? Is anyone in here? Oh, shit. So I go in that direction. Open the door and try and make my way that way. Put your hand back inside. That's a good lad. What's your name? Before I approach. Still far enough away. Ugh. I'm going to call you Orn Blackfoot. My name is Lord Grog. Man, you are looking a little rispy-- Pour out a little ale into a goblet, and I give him a goblet of ale. Ah-ah, not too fast, not too fast, don't want to get the bubbles. And I reach into the Bag of Holding and I have a dry food ration. I have three left. Now I have two. And I give him some dried food ration. Pace yourself, lad. Tell me, why are you in here, Orn Blackfoot? No, they did, to be clear. They totally abandoned you. You are really the only person I know of that's in here. All the other mates around you, they're either sleeping or, you know. Fuck. Orn, did you kill all those dried food rations just now, did you just-- Man, what an appetite. Do you mind regurgitating a little like a momma bird into my hand? Never mind. Orn, don't, heh, don't move. And I walk over to see where the other voice is coming from. Abjurist is a very powerful-- he has knowledge of the arcane and stuff, right, he was-- I found us Boba Fett, sweet! Abjurist Nosebleed, hold on real quick, look. And I take the other, the second to last dry food ration, I give him that, and I give him a thing of ale, I'm like, I'm sorry, it's really dry. Oh, yeah, you're very welcome! Hold on. Is there anybody else in this hallway before I give away my last bit of food? Right, I'm going to pick a number between one and ten. Ready? Go. I lean over to Abjurist Noja, I say, I actually don't know any numbers, so. Y'know what, we're going to deliberate and we'll be with you in just a moment. (whispers) Abjurist, how old y--, why are you in here, who put you in here? Oh, that is a crime. I love b-- I can't even say it. Hold on, stay right there, I'll get you out-- And I walk back to Orn Blackfoot, I go, look, hey, so I gave you food, can you do anything, like, special? Like, can you make your hands turn to flame, can you disappear, are you really good with a bow and arrow? Hey! Orn, chill! Yeah, but most of the people in here are dead, right, like they're probably not-- How long has it been since you've been to Emon? You got any loved ones there? I don't know, just asking, like, do you want me to take a note from you to them or something, you know. Yeah, no, I'm still deliberating, sorry. Enjoy the food that you snuck in your jacket pocket. And I go back towards the front desk area. And I try and find any-- is there a lever on the wall to release the cells or can I look for keys? Fuck me. Your fate is in excellent hands. Oh shit, you're not dead! (laughter) Yeah, just trying some splinters of wood in the locks just in case. (laughs) Forks, yeah. Hey. Hey, you. I kick him in the back a bit. I kick him harder. I look down the hallway. I back up a few steps. And I really run up and kick him really hard. Yeah, you're dead. Can I pat him down? Low perception. Nice! I take the keys and I jauntily run by Orn Blackfoot and I go to Abjurist-- Hey, do you know who those other two voices are at the end of the hallway? Like, did you have anyone with you when you got put in here? Yeah, he's got a really rough accent. Shit. My voice carries. Are you all right here for one minute? I have to go perform an interview real fast. All right, sit tight. All right, you two, put both your hands outside the cell where I can see them. Female elven, or is this female-- Who said three? I know, look, it's always lucky number three, right? That's what they say. Who says that? Oh good. Hi. You look nice. I've got three other goblets left, can I both give them a goblet and some ale, just to wet their lips and get a drink in? You're turning away good ale. Looks like you've seen many a moon. I like your gall. And I pour more ale in. Beautiful. If you don't mind, ladies first, love, what is your name? Why are you in here? You're-- you're farm folk? Do you have any family? What are their names? Sorry, I had a bit of split pea soup that's just disagreeing with me, it's all right. Yep. No, I-- we should get you out of here, there's really bad stuff going on outside, we're trying to get everyone out of the town. Yeah, just a minute, hold on. And so like. Hold on. Can I try the keys on Amelia's cell? Shit. Amelia, if you would, please stay with me. Funny, I believe I heard of a man named Reginald. Very brave. Not sure where he is, but we're going to get you out of the city, just stay put for a moment. All right, you, you salty bastard, what's your name? Lord Grog. Emphasis on the Lord. Yeah. The Vales of Strongjaw. Right. Oh, keys. Can I take the keyring and can I pry the metal keyring-- is it like one solid piece or is it the kind that I could maybe bend it open? 26. Can I take half the keys and give them to Amelia and say, love, would you go and let out the kind gentleman with the reddish beard and the little blood on his mouth named Abjurist, would you try these keys and see if his cell will open? Not yet for Mr. Blackfoot across the way. I take the other half and start trying to get Da-- what was his name? Old, I like old. Okay. Davin, what did you get put in here for? Is that magic? Yeah, it does. Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. But they do make you look very young. Now if we let you out of here, right, which we're actually in the process of doing, what is your weapon of choice? Bloodvine ale? Yeah, no, my-- He's a dwarf, right? Yeah. Obviously we are brothers of the beard. Like, to fight with, right? Yeah, stab, poke, enchant, whatever. I do have a Greatsword of Frenzy, but it's a two-handed weapon. I do also have one regular, just a regular longsword. About the best I have. All right, so. Have I got the door open yet? Before I give you this sword-- --are you up for the fight of your life? Can I insight check him? This is going to go really well. Eight! Nine! Right. Look, your expression says a lot. What if I put an excellent meal in your belly, sharpened that sword some more, would you like to fight for some glory come the morrow? That's what I thought. If you would go join Amelia, I have to get my good friend Abjurist Noja out of his cell and then we're going to go have a meeting, because there's going to be a big feast tonight, it's going to be delicious. You know, it's very secret, yep. Secret location, TBD. Now, has she gotten Abjurist out? Man, I know a lot of people that are going to be really, really happy to see you. Could I ask you a question? So I have this new axe, right, it's really nice. I got it off the leader of goliaths, real prick. It's really strong and I've known about it for years, there's nothing, like, funny about-- Actually, if I give this to you, would you just tell me if you, like, hear anything? Oh. That makes sense. All right. I turn around to Orn Blackfoot and I'm like, "All right, mate. Last chance. Why "should I let you out?" I've done all three of those things more than most men do in three lifetimes. I'm thinking of a number between one and three. Shit. (laughter) Can I insight check if he's a man of his word? Roll better. Shit fuck balls ass. Three. You have a face that is truly trustworthy. And I start looking for the key to his cell. Oh, yeah, well. Noja, Noja, is there a location where your spellbook was last? (belches) Yeah, well, goliaths are awfully fond of books. Let's go find out, shall we? And we go back towards where I guess everybody last was. Well, we could go there now if you'd like. How far is it from here? I forget, it's been a few years. Hold that thought. I grab my earring and I say, can anybody hear me? Right, so. What if I told you I found somebody's name that rhymes with Daburish Koja? It's Abjurist Noja. Yeah, we're like really important. So I'm going to take him to find his spellbook, because I feel like he could be a great-- You don't? Yeah, I found him. I'm going to get him a spellbook. Does anybody want to come with, or are you all good? Yes. The cube is always welcome. Please. It's more like a Coke can. Okay. Um. What? So, Scanlan, if you want to come meet us, we're over by the Iron thing. How would I tell him where we are? I'm over by this thing balalalala. Yeah, is there anything we can help you find that you're looking for? Yeah, can we help him look for any vials, or-- Better. 17. What? Yeah actually, have you ever seen this shrinking potion work, like, how small does something get? That would be the best thing ever. Now that you've found-- I'm sorry, go ahead. That book that you got, it's not your favorite, right, the one that was hidden above the door? Yeah, would you mind? I've never done that before, but the last one I had talked to me. Yeah, among other things. No long card coming? (laughs) Son of a bitch. Thank you, Abjurist, you are as wise as you are. Old. That's lost on me. Do you need anything else? Well, I was going to ask, you do know what is beset upon this city, right? The horrible calamity that's coming? The day's still young. What say we give, like, a solid effort to finding your bigger books, and then if you can't find it and you can lend no aid to us, we'll make sure you find yourself safely on your way? Yeah. He left. I thought you had him. I clearly said when you came up, watch the guy with the black feet. What'd you do? I really can't argue with that. (laughter) 19. I am sorry. Oh, it's like seven feet. Yeah. We'll make sure, we'll keep you on the outsides with those that are not, you know, can't take a good walloping. Not that I would understand, but could you tell us what your specialty is? Abjur--yeah. Mm-hmm. No idea what that means. Oh, like puppets. I'm a big fan of puppets. Oh yeah, we should probably make him a part of the feast. We'll come get you later tonight. With dex? Make it acid damage. (laughter) "Which dice will I use? There's no way to choose." Yeah? No. I want that head. That's right, I put the flayed skin. I don't have the head. I don't have the head. What's the head for? What if you sacrifice me? Yeah, use me as bait! Or I could just put my hands behind my back. Well, I don't know, but it's better live bait than dead, right? At least when you fish. Pretty sure that's true. Yeah. Yeah. (laughs) No, I don't. I will give you the head of Kevdak. I want it back. You better promise. All right. You can have it. I don't want a bow on it! He didn't ever wear a bow! I take the skull and roll it to her feet. It's still got flesh on it, right? Make it 50 feet at the most. You want them to get there in one turn, right? I thought we were all filing out of one hole. I was confused. I might take that. Yeah. Oh my god, I'm going to take the belt off. You don't know that! This shit's in there tight. I take the Belt of Dwarvenkind, and I put it in the Bag of Holding. I put the Displacer Cloak on. What? Wait! Really? Never mind, no. Nope. And Old Davin. Magic-users or clerics. Abjurist and Old Davin included. Wait, before we do that, didn't you do something that gave us an extra amount of hit points before Kevdak? 14? That's not bad. If it's midnight, I would take Aid, just in case he comes in the morning, and if he doesn't, no harm done, you rest up anyway, right? I wouldn't mind taking Aid in case he comes in the morning. If eight hours pass I lose it anyway, but you rest up again. Yeah, just in case he comes in the morning. Yeah, before first light. How high do you want to cast it? Rock out. Go for it. Five times five? It'll hold for eight hours, right, or, but I lose it-- You're asleep. Yeah man, it's as good a time as any. I'm going in that tunnel, too. If you drop below zero, you come back to one. I'm down in the tunnel. I'm down over here. I'll throw her out of there if something goes wrong. How about fuck shit up? 20. If I were near you, I would slap you. Get a hold of yourself, man! I go into a rage, and I would like to run up behind him with my Bloodaxe and make two reckless attacks against him. 26. That's really good. 28. So, that's 23 with three points of necrotic damage. Oh, that's part of it, yeah. And then the second one-- 22 with one point of necrotic damage. With my bonus action, could I drink the potion of fast nuts? Potion of speed. I believe you're right. Never mind. I think you're right. That'll hit. It's a 20. What's in the book? Yeah. Could I go into a frenzied rage? Excellent. I'm on top of a pillar, and I'm not within striking distance, right? From up there? (laughs) I would like to use all three of my attacks against his backside, reckless. Natural 20. 26. These are just regular. They're not great weapon master. 23. Sweet. So the first one was the crit. Right. That's a d12. 21 and two additional d12s? Ten, 31. Seven, so 38. That was awful. 13. That was also pretty crap. That's 16. Oh, I did not add the necrotic. On all three of them. Three, six, eight. Total of eight. (singing) I believe I can fly-- A nine. Reduced to... 16. He's taking a photo. Yeah, we said to lift it off. No. Marriage fucked everything up. How high is he? Fuck him up, Pike. Probably not. But against dragons it does specific damage. Is it grabbing him or not? Is that the third one? What's left of the Herd. Come on, goliaths and Herd, please roll better. Scholars, the lot. You're going to pay for that later, by the way. Yes, I have two questions. One of the things I picked up from Kevdak were four enchanted javelins. What do those do? And they're just enchanted? Just that. What is my climbing speed? If my natural speed is 50 and I wanted to climb that column, what's the climbing speed? On my back, can I use my bonus action to drink the potion of speed, which makes me hasted? I do. And it doubles my speed, right? Okay, so I have 100 feet, so can I stand up? Can I try and climb that column towards Umbrasyl's feet? That's not awesome. 18. So I have four attacks? Yeah, so I'll use three of the enchanted javelins and the javelin of lightning. Reckless, all of them. Yeah, it's 120 feet for the javelin of lightning. It's an 11 plus-- just my natural like-- Right. Oh no, my proficiency-- Okay. Where's my proficiency-- oh five, I got it. Okay. Is 28. Is 19. And the second one, the last one is a 30. That's right. So that's 12. 14. 17. Okay. 4d6. 13. Six-- Yup. Yeah. I stay up? 16. Resistance, so I halve that? Copy that. No, it came in handy for the one. We don't even know where you are, really. 18. 21. Is 15 halved for me for the bludgeoning, or is that already halved? A 21? My eight is halved. Pike! Still hasted. Can I stand up? And with the Titanstone Knuckles, can I smash them together and cast Enlarge on myself? (cheering) Being that I'm hasted, can I move directly behind Umbrasyl, like underneath him and behind? And can I attach the chain of returning to the Bloodaxe-- Yes. And can I throw it at Umbrasyl? Do I have four? No, I just have one throw. If I want to. Reckless. That's even better. 29. 21. With one point of necrotic damage. I don't want to pull it loose. I just want to weigh on it. Does enlarging do anything to my damage? Sorry. I didn't do that. Can I do that? Hey, four! Say that again, Perce. I'm still attached to him, too. I'm going for a ride. Yup. Advantage on this. 24. Three of us are not here next week. It's either that or-- We're not here. Laura, Travis, and Sam. That 30 minutes fucked us. It's the shaft of an arrow. Made me drop my fucking jelly bean. We're doing great. No.
