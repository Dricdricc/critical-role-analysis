You've already fallen apart. And Liam is? Sam, what is Liam from? That's right. Yep. Are you? Little Shop of Horrors meets peanut M&Ms. That's really smart! I'm pretty sure there was some Rick and Morty in there too. Laura will be stealing this book. And it's, like, super textured. All the d20s are something different. Keyleth's has antlers. Mine has a big ale of mug on the 20. Oh, yours is dope, with the two arrows and the bear paw! It looks all marble-ized! What nerd got a book on theirs as the 20? Get your d20! And it's soft, as with all of our things. Where did that come from? Oh shit! The tongue lick after each sibilant is the best. New one of these next week. Yeah, I'm doing a one-shot. Or rather, Grog is running a one-shot. Grog's game-night comes next week, where we will all play Bunions and Flagons. Lots of algebra, trigonometry. Yep. A game within a game, if you dare. Pretty much. But he is the game master, so. Nothing to worry about. Everyone's totally safe and fine. And you're alive, by the way. Oh, good! Thanks! I killed a bunch of clickers to get here. There were some cannibals. But the Fireflies are on my six, so we should get started. It makes me look far wiser than I actually am. I can reverse math all day. We do have one extra announcement. I forgot. November 17th, some of us will be attending PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia. There will be Matt and Marisha. Taliesin. Liam will be making it. Laura and I will be in Australia, unfortunately. Sam can't make it, but the four of them will be intrepidly braving the Philadelphia PAX Unplugged. You're such a goober. They'll be there. You can see them Friday night. There will be two things. Let's make sure that I have this right. 100-230pm Eastern Standard Time is the Critical Role panel and then the signing will be 530-730 Eastern Standard Time. PAX Unplugged on Friday. Info should be on the website. If it changes stay tuned. If you're in that area, come out, throw things at them because we won't be there. Obfuscate? I don't think you used that term correctly. That means you vanish, but you've got to hold still right? Yeah. And to our rescue came Matthew Colville. Did he have claws? Is the tunnel backup blocked by debris and other-- Mm-hmm. Well jesus, Taliesin. Oh that's right. We didn't have our phones in the first place. So that thing on your wrist is-- Being that I have heightened senses, what can I see in our new under the earth situation? Okay. Just a red d10? Six. A six and above is a success right? Yep. Do we see any slime or hair or anything that's like "Oh this is a--?" Or, or we can do the thing that we've learned from being Vox Machina for so long. Who's super fast, like the Flash? Yeah, you should run ahead, dart ahead of all of the rest of us and check it out. There's just enough light coming from the bottom of the tunnel? I think that's a good idea. Good call. Yeah, I'm glad we agree. I will kill him first. Yeah, either one of two. Yeah, do that. Well, we know you're fans of rats, but-- How far behind you? We will follow not so closely behind. SAM, LIAM, and You look like if the clown from Spawn was trying to be PacMan. Pac McFarlane. PacMan. You just eat people now. Sofa king? Live there? What happened to you in that coffin? We're talking about you. Wait, didn't a week go by? Wait, raise your hand if you've killed somebody? A person? Yeah. Wait no. Oh, you left him for dead. Okay. I'm just checking to make sure like-- Might be holding onto this for no good reason. No, that's the truth, preach. I know. Forever. Let's go see the sewer a little more closely. I feel weird about this. Just committing to being-- I don't know if I want to stay this way. I like the sun. It's warm-- Yeah. I mean, there are night games but-- I mean, you can, it's just super dark and swimming in the ocean at night is scary. Yeah. All water? Yeah, we've got to go forward. I have amazing senses, I hear everything that you're saying. Then why are you directing it towards her shoulder? No, I knew that too. Just a tremor. Oh wait! Shh. I actually hear something down this way. Yeah. No, we're going this way. We'll go towards that noise. Can I snag one of the rats and fucking rip its head off? And squeeze it like a thing of toothpaste? Dex brawl. All the dice. Three successes, two failures. But none of them are red. Two ones, but they're black ones. I was going for the rat, yeah. Toothpaste rat. Damn it! Fuck! I should have eaten somebody. I'm so hungry, I've got all these red dice. I can get rid of one of these? Yes! What? I'm trying to embrace it. Forever. Okay. Yeah, let's do that. Oh, me too because I'm actually perceptive for once. Two successes. Two successes, no failures. Whoa. Is there any pavers or anything in this tunnel or does it still look like it was burrowed? Like rudimenti-larily. We're making pretty good distance, I think we're close to Mullholland. Taggers? Well, we can't go back the way we came, we've got to find a way out, at least. Okay, just perception. That is a crit. Two tens. In the tunnel with us? There's-- there is-- Don't look up, there's-- (incoherent mumbling) There's something above us, and it's reptilian looking. Yeah, Celerity. We're all giving chase, we're trying to catch up. Ooh. That means you get another-- I'm pretty fast, could I get there and try and help? What the fuck is that thing?! His name's Slock? Yes! Of course, man. The rest are in DC. We want to let you go, we don't mean you any direct harm, but we need to know how to get out of this tunnel. We're going to eat him. "I don't want to be a vampire." We're going to eat him. We're literally hours into this thing, we don't mean any offense. Okay, hold it, take it easy. You're rolling crap tonight. We'd be most grateful. Like you? I think it's the best we can do. Watch where you point that thing. Who will we be meeting? Sure. As we're walking from behind, can I use my Aura Perception to see what his true motives are as he's leading us to this chamber? Fuck! Yeah, a red one. I was at three, down from the four from my wife rat! Now I'm back up to four. That's one blood one and three successes. But not the "I'm leading them into a trap?" I whip my hair back and forth! Probably not the restaurant. See, Taliesin's so immortal, he remembers the civilizations that preceded-- Fair enough. I'll go in. What's your intelligence rating? Three and mine's four. So yeah, I'll do that. Is this Tibet's doing? Oh, it's okay. Okay, great. Laura and I will co-lead this venture into the chamber. Yeah, I think that's actually a good idea. Yeah, in fact, just stay behind Sam. Super cool. My 1600 will hold up. And are you familiar with one Gary Gygax? Yes. Many of us have. We were surprised to see him up and walking about a mere hour after we woke and found ourselves in this state. Did we grab any posters or fan art on our way out? Is there any way to be of service? We don't mean to offend. He's really fast. I can sense things. We're very interested in that. Clearly. Well, we might change that. We're very interested in getting to the surface. We will deliver your message as you've described it. Infancy. Got it. Yeah, and fashion trends? They're such a bitch to keep up with. Their router obviously runs through Malaysia. We're ready to go. I'll go first this time. I'm very perceptive. I can hear and smell and see things. I'm a fucking vampire. I'll fly up there. I go and I try to fly. Aw, damn it! I thought I was going to Lost Boys that shit. Fuck! Okay. Wait, (mumbling). All successes, no failures, and one ten. One, two, three, four, five. I didn't want to show off too long. I make my way up toward the ladder. So the ladder goes straight up, and then it turns? At the surface, or into more under-earth? Yeah. I'm up here. There's a tunnel that continues at the top of this stupidly, absurdly long ladder. It's only single-file. I guess you guys can make your way up here, and we can crawl wherever this goes. Will you ask Mahlo if we're supposed to crawl through this? Okay. Well, go ahead and come up. I'll get started. Do I hear anything in the tunnel, now that I'm up there? With four red dice, I'll just listen. Okay. Do I see anything, like a switch or a button, to lower something? I rolled a one. Yeah yeah yeah. I will fucking fang you right now. Does anybody else want to open the fucking door, for once? Is there a name on the outside of the crypt that we walked out of? Hollywood cemetery. Do they look like they're paying their respects? Oh, okay. Great. No! I am going to do a little natural selection. Is there anyone that looks like they are weak and clearly ailing and ready to have it all come to an end? I'm definitely looking for somebody. I've got four red dice. Question. If we try and herd them, won't they be doing that human thing called screaming, and making a racket? "I'm pretty sure this is the one thing I can break into." Of course! You killed Will Friedle! What do you think Liam's doing? Or, you know, you're also super charming. You could just-- You've got a trustworthy face. Maybe ask if somebody will take a picture of us over by this crypt, you know? Like we're visiting. I've seen the movies. I'm going to drain you to life's edge, and then I'll open up my wrist and give you a little-- I grab him and I throw him into the crypt. (laughter) I take his chin and I go, sorry, Mike! And I smash his head against the back of the crypt. I'm fucking tired of your bullshit! (snarling) Five successes, no failures. All the way. Well, yeah. Six. No, I got a six. This is not what we want for our friends. I'll take his head and-- You want to make him a vampire? Okay. So what, you want us to leave him in here? We should walk him back to Manzi. Well, how many of these did I get rid of? I was four blood. Fine. Actually, I pick his head up and I feel around on the back side. How's the back of the head? Sorry, Mike. Nothing personal. You made me feel bad. You get to kill random Smart Girl people, and Mike gets away. It's okay for you, just not cool for other people, huh? Yeah, pretty much. Is he a vampire? He had to leave? He couldn't say hi to us first? Did you leave him alive? We're really supposed to be meeting up with someone. We told you we were new. Sorry. We're just trying to flush this out. Enough delays. We should really go. We have a promise to keep. We were just about to kill Mike Diva. You get one. I just realized Liam has the habit of killing NPCs before they ever utter a word. Well, I guess he protested through the door. I would like to use Google Translate. What about my iWatch? Are we inside or are we outside the club? At the door? Then we go right in? Hemoglobin sticky or alcohol sticky? I'll look for a VIP area. Okay. You've never been in a bar before. (laughter) I had three successes on looking for the VIP area. Is there a bouncer? I'll walk up to him. We're supposed to meet someone in here. We're probably not, but me and my three friends are new to this scene. My name is Travis. How does one go about getting on the list? Does he seem like a human? One success, no failures. While I am standing at the rope talking to this gentleman, can I look and see who I see in the VIP area? A lot of people, a few people? Fantastic. I'll be back once we're on the list. Thanks for your time. And I go find Sam. I make my way over to Laura and Sam. I'm like, Sam, I need your-- what are you doing? My apologies. I pull him off the dance floor with Laura. Yeah. So there is a VIP lounge but we apparently need to be on the list. I don't know how to do that. You're fast as shit. How about I distract or-- Maybe. Or if there's a payphone at the bar we could call and pretend to be-- She's also nigh-invisible. I'll do that. Yeah. I'm really breaking my own finger. Three successes, no failures. I'll just (cracking sound). It normally stays-- I'm hoping that vampires have amazing regenerative powers. What if I pulled it out? You don't even really-- is it bleeding? Is the bone out? Is he going to be looking for me? You got to do what you need to do. Yeah. There's four of us. Three go. Go! Not yet. The vampire shock will wear off in a second. And then all the humans in this bar will be dead. Yeah. (laughs) What the fuck? (shouting) I just said bite it to fix it! I'm a ninja turtle now! What the hell, man? This guy-- not this gentleman. This guy that just bolted for the bathrooms, he just pulled my finger-- Do you have a first aid kit? I'll get out of your hair. I'll just need a first aid kit. We were trying to get on the list. A voice from above says-- Is the wound continuing to bleed or does it-- Yeah. Yeah. Just one? Four. What does my blood look like? But that's actually the name of a show. Brighter than the rest of these murdering fucks? I am going to resist! Oh no, it's the one you took! Always you. It's dead blood, yeah. So we make our way to the top of the stairs. What do we see? Fat Boy Slim. Are there any golden thrones? A bar? My dark gift. No. Like ashes and mushrooms. Before you go, have you seen Taliesin? He's the only one we haven't seen. Any recommendations from the bar? Fair enough. I head towards the bar. I saw the sign... TRAVIS and We go to the bar. Okay. Barkeep! Would you thrill us with four glasses of whatever you would like tonight? Dealer's choice. Does somebody scream when it gets pulled? (yelling) Do they smell Irish? European? Has a nose of--? A toast. I feel we're finally in a sort of safe place. To the new world order, right? To our fallen-- Yeah. May they live forever as dust and spore. Drink up! To rats. You're sleeping in your own coffin tonight. As we sip these drinks and we turn our backs to the bar, posting up like one does, can I see with my Heightened Senses anyone giving us a look of malcontent? Before I look at the smiling faces, do I get any whiff of a giant dog in the crowd? I'll do that. Perception and investigation. Jesus-- I'll use the Heightened Senses aspect. Two successes. Can I focus on the smiling faces and see what we see? Laura? Erika Ishii's here. Her hair's so cool. None that we recognize, though? A critical. Two tens. This is a happening spot. Yeah, look at Sam. We're totally cool. He speaks nine languages. It was an explosion. You remember Matthew Colville, right? Yeah, we woke up in coffins, missing Taliesin. Matt and Marisha were killed while we were trying to figure out what was actually going on. Oh yeah, I was supposed to give you-- I didn't think it would be you, but I'm supposed to say they're very displeased and that we need to make amends. We've got to find a way back to our friendship. You guys are supposed to offer a boon-- Mahlo, or it was Lockey? I didn't even know he was alive. And Tara, too? Rats, man. We ate rats. Raise your hand if you haven't done anything inappropriate. And as far as monsters go, thank god we know you, right? Seems like you're pretty high up right now. Like a foster situation or-- Sure would love to avoid that. Yeah. I stab my newly healing finger. Do you know what's wrong with Liam's face? I don't know how to break it to you, man. You're a little flakey. Wow. We all have to do that? This fight is mine. She hated your dancing! So my wife and I, you know, I think we're open to all scenarios at this point. I'm extremely strong. I'm not terribly ugly. I'll kill anybody you want and I can also talk a lot less than that guy. (singing) Five gold and a party! You're the alpha and omega of 20s and ones. The two of you. Sure you did. (laughs) Uh-huh. It was like the worst Walmart job application ever. I work well with others and I'm quite affable-- If I could, my wife is a fantastic person and she understands how valuable the relationship between the vampire world and the human world is and how much it must be protected. Such a delicate balance. We are here to disappear and never cause a bit of trouble and only to learn. I knew it. (laughs) She was very remorseful. I would have taken a life if it hadn't been for her. If one of us can only enter this world, I would ask that it be her. Oh yeah. I'm sorry. I suddenly feel this lingering shame and guilt. But as the person who applied it is now dead, I don't feel-- I will burn a willpower. I now have five successes and no failures. Oh good. No, I would never have stepped into that-- that's a fool's errand. I know better. The Tremere family! Do I get a hint as to who my honorable sponsor might be? LAURA  It's Satine! Oh, fantastic. I'm thrilled. She's a really good sponsor! What do you mean, we don't know what happened to Taliesin? Could we have found him in the one-shot? We're not going to have a Talks this week because it's Halloween. Where Mary came from? Nicely done! Yeah. Still up and running? Starts taking some of its characteristics? My turn. Yeah. Actually, Grog's turn. It's not me. Brilliant. Happy Halloween!
