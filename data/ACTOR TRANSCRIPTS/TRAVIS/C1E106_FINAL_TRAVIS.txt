Percy, what's yours? We already surpassed the number of seats we had last year, because we have an extra thousand seats in this larger theater. It's going to be a madhouse. We only have 400 left. Well, see, you'd have to be there to find out, so if there is a car, a plane, or a train, or a telephone booth around you, get to Indianapolis on August 18th! Shit. It was terrible. It was really bad. Even more reason! I have some notes on the book. Could it have less words? Does it have a small creature in it? And they're out of stock. (snoring) Nobody cares but you. Larkin! Many don't. I thought that was hair and makeup-- I've been thinking about getting some highlights for this beard. (singing) Beauty school dropout. We want to fight. Hashtag blessed. We fought once, and if this is a broom motion, we were just getting swooped. Swept. What is it? Swiffered. Oh. What a roller coaster. I was going up and then going back down. Thank you for your gaze, my lady. And the cube. Incantation of Isolation? We don't know the name of the book, right? So we can't Locate Object. How do we do that? Sprigg! Do you have a tome at your place that has the Incantation of Isolation? Can it work like that? Or about the Chained Oblivion. Potentially. Or the Dawnfather helped seal with Ioun. Scattered amongst or categorized by language? No, it continues writing, right? Potentially, there's a book. I jump in and start throwing pillows around. Did she leave anything cool behind? I drink them. Ooh! I found a large book on one of the nearby tables. Luck! Oh my god. Are you fucking kidding me? What the hell, man? (singing) And there's a million things he hasn't done. Oh fuck. Lin-Manuel just turned it off. Damn, Scanlan got bars, y'all. Find somebody that can pick them locks. What happens when you say that shit?! Yeah. The spirits'll put them back. Talk to it. What if you write in it? Didn't you ever watch Harry Potter? He wrote in the book and it wrote back! Do you have a quill? Can you write it in? Can you write something in the book? What else can you do to imbue it with magic? She just asked for the tome, right? You got it. LAURA and She disappeared. Where is she? I've been digging through the pillows. Regis Philbin. Yep! Third nip, third eye. You're good. It's the gold thing that came with the original Nintendo Entertainment System. The Game Genie. Proficient with blacksmithing tools? That water's not so evil, after all! (laughter) Don't look at somebody else, motherfucker. That's you! It's like the kid that farts in class and then looks at the guy behind him. It was 800 years ago. MARISHA and Not Craven Edge? Oh. I'm glad to hear that. Bye, Sprigg. In the beginning? Or more recently? Oh yeah, the guy that you put in the shackles. But we want to get the shackles back. I know when I feel overwhelmed I like to punch things. You want to hit me? (groans) Too strong. Oh, such a monster. Thank you. Fudge knuckles. Darin De Paul! (applause) And to EmeraldStar in the chat, who named their puppy Grog, that's awesome. Hard to be mad at an arsonist when they're fluffy. Are there any threatening creatures in the vicinity? Don't worry, it's a 14. Yeah, the squirrel goes (running noise, explosion). Outstanding! The words were uttered. No, I pull Scanlan aside. I want to see it. No, the seed. The little bean. Yeah, I want to see it. Is it squishy? Did I? I don't know what any of you are talking about. Are you giving it to me? Yep. I've got it. Over here. (sniffs) What does it smell like? (deep inhale) What does it smell like? Don't fucking rob me of my discovery. 11. Smells like old money. It's been tucked in that old boob crevice. I want you to swallow the bean. Think about Sprigg, right? His tummy was glowing like fucking Teddy Ruxpin. I want to see you swallow that shit. (gasps) Oh my god! What, are you crazy? I was only kidding! I lose these every time, no matter how low it is. Eight. Nope. That's a six minus one, which is five. (laughter) I hope you know what you're doing. Do we get time with you before you leave? Where did that pencil go?! I pick Scanlan up by the scruff of his neck, and I hold my ear to his tummy. Nine! Oh my god. It's growing. Tell me your last rites before you burst, if it happens. Oh shit. Write that down, somebody? I'm holding him up like a seashell. Why? Do you not like it? Oh shit. You lost me. Why not? That's Vecna. Booby traps. (laughs) I love it when they come begging for a truce. That means he's scared. He said, of Exandria. Vasselheim doesn't take very kindly to magic stuff. I am quite famous. Sure, why not. What am I looking like? I have to attune to it; it takes forever. Will you make me look like Tary? Well, it's not like he was in the room where it happened. Where are you going? Is he a vampire? You're just chilling like a villain under the blood?! That is a big bean. Just a minute. I have a question. How many times have you done that? My gods. We don't know where that blood's from! I have a thought, right? Do we give a shit about Kord at all, or no? I'll ask. He might just say no. Yep. It's right here. It's like popping into Blockbuster when you go to the grocery store. Might as well see what's up. No, Blockbuster. Where are you from? I mean, we got free reign. We got backstage passes. Everybody's like, "right through here!" Yeah, you seem to be super tight with-- Yeah, that was my (stammers) assess, as well. I was just going to go speak to Earthbreaker Groon. I don't know what's so hard about that. He gave me these gloves last time. Am I still blue? Yeah, you tweedles want to come? No, I want to be blue. Yeah. I want to stay blue. Yeah you can dissipate, right? Yeah. That cool? You guys rest. I'm going to go find us a bean of strength and might and sex appeal. Can I go to the temple of Kord? They don't have Raven Queen cots or something? Can we go?! I didn't realize. To the temple of Kord. Big man outside. The Trial Forge with the big doors. Nice. (loud knocking) I apologize for the late flower. Don't be confused. It's me, Grog Strongjaw, wielder of the Titanstone Knuckles. (whispers) I'm in-cog-Cheeto. Yeah, I seek an audience with Earthbreaker Groon. Very important. It pertains to the emergence of Vecna. May I approach? (jumping and landing) Three-point stance. We have urgent business-- what are you drawing there? Right, sorry. We come with grim tidings. Vecna is at large, and we mean to take him down. We have a theory. We think he might be originating in Wildemount? No. You might want to talk through me. I'm his most prized pupil. In the sandpit? Lady Vex'ahlia. Great fighter, very brave. I was hoping that you would know how to contact him directly, perhaps maybe have something that was tuned to his plane of existence, potentially. Self-reliance. See if he wants box seats or something? Free food and drinks? Do you happen to know, from all your years of meditation, what plane or where Kord might reside? Ysgard? East guard. (laughter) (clears throat) Ysgard. Hmm. Is that on another plane? Listen, he is very busy right now with his meditation garden. Action now would prevent the spread of his power. Fair enough. You don't happen to have a bean on you, do you? Hard no? I look inside. Everybody else got one. I've got a satchel. Just fucking name the group after me. We are out. Thank you! I'll do it, too, because I was curious. Don't worry about it. (laughter) I thank you for seeing us at this late hour, and I wish you luck in the defense of this temple and this city. You have been. Oh fuck! That was a noble answer! I'm sorry. I'm cool. We're out. Make sure as we leave, we back away. Back away. That was a total win. I got a bag full of beans. Yep. And we know that Kord is on "he's-a-god." You're saying it weird. "He's-god." So should I change back? What do you mean? You can't? We're going back to sleep, right? It's either that or I put a fancy robe over my whole face. We make our way back to the temples. Is the bustle the same outside of the temple? The multiple blue jobs. Air force got scrambled. (aircraft noises) Amazing! So a question what's on the menu? Now, look. How do you even know that? Why would you only serve beans? There's no meat or fish? Because of your daughter? Well, she's not here. Can we make an exception? I got what we needed. I got myself a bean. I got several shards. I got a bag full of shards. Hold on, the power might bowl you all over. What are you doing? (gasping) How do you feel? These are not the same thing? Is there a table nearby? I dump all the beans out on the table. Are there any beans that look different from the rest? (laughing) 16. Does that count? These are the beans. I mean, I should've thought-- Kord is a fist, and you put one of each four on the knuckles. I squish each one of the beans. I'm not a praying man. Bless my gauntlet. Anything happen? Are they glowing? You know what? I bet if I pray hard enough, they will disappear. Look above you! LAURA and Hey! That's not terrible. (laughing) I got plus two! 18! (laughter) Yeah. Well, the line between me and Kord. Super tight. Pike! Pretty good, right? I know. Maybe I should get a tattoo for Kord, like the symbols you have for Sarenrae. I don't know. A fist? Hey, don't put ideas in my head. A bean? The Storm Lord symbol is the jam. That is a cartoon bean. The dick is smaller than the balls. It's like a parrot's beak. Listen. We're going to stick with the Storm Lord sigil. Well, listen, I found out where Kord is. He's in a place called-- LAURA and Are you familiar? Oh. Why'd you say sure? I do that all the time. Anybody have any idea where that is? Okay. Who can we ask? 17, but I'm not trained in it. (sighs) Okay. How did Pike roll? Fuck! Yeah, that we buried under a mountain. I don't know. There were a bunch of digits. You know, we could always take Kima's greatsword. It's made out of solid platinum. Yeah, she does. I'm just saying. 1,600 platinum. 1,619. I'm familiar with it, all of a sudden. So because we have these shards, right, these magical beans, if we lose, do we effectively kill all the gods whose shards we have? Yeah, that's a lot of responsibility I was not aware of. Worst scenario possible. Cool. Good to know. Shouldn't you rest first? Yeah, a green emerald gem in one socket, you dicks. What? No, it's in Percy's workshop. That's true. I mean, do you need me to drop my scholastic knowledge on this shit? Because I will. It talked to me and it was like, "If you free me, I'll give you a wish." Yeah. Why do you think I was trying to break that shit? Do you know for sure? Then what are we talking about? He did. A giant blade that emitted shadow. Wait a minute. Aren't we forgetting about one undead thing? Didn't we want to go back and talk to Delilah's body? Are we not in the mansion right now? I never left. Undead gas. We're right behind you; it's fine. How many do we get, five? I'm writing them down in my mind. One more question. Do we want to ask where he is? Where he was going? What his plan is after ascending? Where he is or where he's planning to attack first or what his display of power is going to be? So we have sword of Kas, bloody knight, what he's trying to do to prevent his binding, weakness/fears, and display of power. You good with those five? Does he got holes? My son. Where? Plus, we need to rest. We have to prepare. The tunnels have toxic fumes and all sorts of stuff. You know, like you do. Yes. Do you do anything?
