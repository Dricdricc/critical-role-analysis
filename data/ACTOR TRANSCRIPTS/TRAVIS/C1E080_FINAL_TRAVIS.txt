Yes! I wanted to give a quick shout out to Kathy Creshe, Creshaw, I don't know how to say it. From Pennsylvania. We love you, from us, to you. - It was wonderful. Not, "He's Spanish too." Muy bien! - A future translator will then, like, show up? - That was great. Hands up! - Hands up! When you say it like that. Oh God, oh God, oh God. - Damn it! - His home security system still pays for it. - Damn it. Punk ass, Raishan. You're saying there's a chance. So, it's covered with rocks. That's good, that's good, that's good. It's a bloody fart. - Isn't that poaching? I'm working on it. Closer, Matt? It's like a jet fighter. - He's using dry erase. Did you have us on tiny plastic eggs? Let me check. Enlarge 10 minutes. What? You've taken a few dragon fire breaths to the face. The fact that you have any hair is by the grace of your ancestral history. That Dwarven belt you have. Yeah. - I'll just roll it. I still have Pike with me, right? Yes, no, no, I was right before Vax. Who? - Me? - I got a little backpack. Yeah. The force. That was terrible. I think that's his brother, Carl. Wisdom? Thanks, Pike. Damn. (laughing) I cast Menopause on you. You bastard. What does that mean? What does it mean? You look fabulous. She's blazing us, ya'll. She's lighting us up. Doesn't Hunter's Mark feel like something sometimes? Laser pointer right here. Covered in rock, we can't see. Only one way to find out. Can I smack Shaun's ass as I go by? Going, "Come on, Shaun." - Do I get any additional movement or am I just here now? "I'm here. Let the piñatas begin." "I don't know, I thought it was a celebration. -Is it not?" - Sulfurous gas. It wrecks your shit. Do I smell anything? "Honestly, really? I mean, come on." "Did you eat mustard pretzels before this, my god?" Calm? Here's a pointer. We're in a no magic zone. Just ruins everything I was gonna do. "I just got here." ♪ Dancing on the ceiling ♪ ♪ Oh, what a feeling ♪♪ Shit. - Ten. Grog both lose your footing and plummet backward. Gilmore rolls a natural 20, he's fine. - A whole bunch of cheese here. We should just call that Raishan's turn. We'll all turn into chickens. And then the eggs will turn into big chickens. Constitution? Twenty-seven. - Oh, fuck. Amazing, yes. Change it, don't ever say it right. It got used once, where was it? Damn. - Are there lasting effects from Adele Nazeem's wilting? Like are we halved or anything? - It just sucks right now is all I know. Everything just sucks. Okay. Fuck. And she's 40, 40 up? Wow! "Yeah, she's fine." Fifty-seven. Not my balls! Uh, can I get up, please? - Can I see Vex sprawled out? Yeah, can I run to Vex? (humming) I have one really-- what's the really big potion? -Is it the Superior? - I have one of those. Can I shove it in her gullet? Okay, I want you to reroll a character. Here we go. I'm going to take my axe and-- Yeah, I shove it in her mouth. Oh, I got to roll it? - Oh, gee-- oh man. Twenty-four. - Thirty-two. - Yeah, just rolling through. I might have chipped a tooth... Like Mentos and Coke. (snarls) Just stay there like Tinkerbell. You are grounded. Slow poke! That Holy Avenger's real heavy. All legendary-- did you hear that? Pike's up. - So careful. That's good shit. At 27. Seven points of healing, so yeah. Yep. - I will cuddle you, I will cuddle. Shot. On cue! (cheering) Come on, you deranged-- 21. - It's cool, you can just go. Handshake? Oh! - You are Anakin on the riverbed. I was so preoccupied, I missed it. Is it flat or is it... I thought you were saying you were gonna like roll him in the lava. Oh my God. You would have turned into a vestige. Duvet. What is she casting? That was a day ruiner, right? Day ruiner. (talking over each other) There's no chance that was like a healing spray, was it? Like the gesture of surrender? I think he's just-- Attacking like his carry-on? Me? - Can I run over with Shaun? Can I attach the Chain of Returning to the axe? Then, can I swing it really hard and go, "Yeah, catchphrase!" and throw it up. (laughter) Good, reckless, please. That's a natural 20. - Oh, and with the brutal critical, I get two additional... Yeah, I do double it? That's a six, so that's 12. I'm enlarged. Where's the triangle, who took the triangle? That's 29 and then two additional d12. Nine, 38. Ten, 48. No. - Brutal critical, you get two additional damage die on my roll. Yeah, I'll pull it back. Yeah, I got it. 23. I didn't know I was this powerful. What the fuck happened? Rolling towards that end of the map as far as I go. Can I go that way? Yeah, that's cool. -Cool. - Towards Matt. - Easter egg. You have one more dice to roll. - Yep. That's it, that's Raishan at 22. - Nothing cool, nothing cool with that! Sure is glad you're here! No court speak here. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. C'mon, J'Mon. 16d6. Well, that might actually help. Wow. Damn it. Nine points, okay. "Fine, whatever." ♪Feel the heat.♪ I love that reference. Nice job. Come on. How's that terrible, that's not terrible. - But you're totally immune. That's gotta make it. - I'll let you know. It is called LA Smog. Oh my God! How y'all doing? Didn't you put air bags on that thing? That's right, it's magic, it goes... I think that's what she meant, yeah. That's literally what she just said. Damn it, damn it, damn it. Why'd she have to leave? I just wanted to give her a high five. Didn't pick up anything else? Might have been like Vision and you made 'em super strong. Just eggs? No, no, unconscious. - Unless it's your total hit points. I would hit the dragon cause it's low enough, but it's on the other side of the map. Come on, Gilmore. What about Razzle Dazzle? Can he cast like-- Yeah. Wait, where did Gilmore go, I can't see. Is that five total? This is some kind of horrible record. Sit down. - Hey! I have a question. - So my speed is 50, but I don't know if I ever thought of what my speed is enlarged-ish. It's not double, right? I don't really have a card for it. It doesn't say anything about my speed. Yeah, okay. So, from where I am, if I wanted to head towards you, how far could I get? That does fuck all. I could throw the axe but Pike's unconscious. -I'm gonna run to Pike. - And I have the middle potion available. - The Greater. How many-- How many is that, I don't remember. - Okay. Four. Four, that's two. Hey, seven and a four is eleven. Fifteen. Fifteen points to Pike. Fuck. ♪ Shit. While you were peeing. - No, no, no, no. - I don't believe it. - I don't believe. I don't believe it! Jesus. It is her last. Pike was not unconscious. She was up with 15-- Oh, why didn't I just pick her up? No. Yeah, heal herself please. This sucks! I got some potions cause I never use 'em, but... I've got all the ones I've never used. Go. - Come on, come on. Fuck! Is not knocked prone? Don't you-- shh! ♪ I gotta get through this ♪ ♪ I gotta get through this ♪ ♪ I gotta get ♪♪ Nice. Fuck. Me too, right? That's not bad. I rolled a 19. Okay. I just want to go flip the table over. No! - I heard him say that before he died. Twenty-four. Plus 10 for constitution. - Fourteen. Are you serious? - Smoke the tunnel, dude. Maybe you get her, maybe you don't. I'm gonna shut up. Don't worry, I'm gonna take off at a run and-- Picture Butterbean running down an empty street. He's just like... (whimpers) Cause if you miss, you trap us. Indiana Jones and the Last crusade. Oh, she is? - On what, on what? How many hit points do you have? How many hit points do you have? One six or six zero. - The actual rule that we didn't use the very very first time. But we felt it last time. (laughing) I can't see! It's just a wall of tears. This is the best. Oh, shit. - Just-- Come on, stay with it. -Stay in the fight. - He wakes up! I got her, I got-- I got Pike. I think it's me. - No, it's Gilmore. "Through the tunnel." No. She made a Lite Brite wall. He's a mime. Oh, fuck, Thordak is outside of the cave! Thordak is still in the hallway. I run to my buddy, Pike, and I beer bong this Greater healing potion into her gullet. What is that? - Eight. Twelve. -Twelve points. - "Hi, hi!" -"Go, heal!" - "Lot of problems." The eggs that remain are toast? Alright, that ends my turn. I'm using what's left of my movement to go towards that egg. Yeah, the one shot egg. - You failed it? - You are shitting me. It doesn't flicker, doesn't-- Well, phone's out, oh God. What? It holds? "It--it holds?" Holy shit. Are you conscious? Or maybe it's like a Pacific Rim-- I would have picked her up after the last time. I was being pissed about-- I mean, you know, she's so tiny. She's on a 30 second delay so she wrote that before we said it. She sent a picture. - "Used twice while in rest..." Welcome back, we're still fucked by the way. They sealed us in here with a giant magic screen across this door. Dragon's breath does nothing, Kima does nothing. You know anything about this? Any limericks for magic cave doors? Who let the dog out? You're gonna be all by yourself. You look like you're up to something, do you have a plan? Right, as a backup plan... So, we couldn't like all Falcor on J'Mon up to the spider network of tunnels in the ceiling, right? Like we couldn't ride him. Could she get us up there and then follow us up through the tunnels if we-- It's better than this place. They're exhaust tunnels. That's my idea. And then, I'm gonna end my turn. Oh, yeah! Shamone! Yeah, I'll just run towards egg. Ooh! I'm gonna use all three of my attacks on that egg. That's a-- that's a 33. - Oh, minus five. Okay. That's a 31, no, 39. Oh. - Did any dragon parts spill out of the egg? Could I grab a piece of it, take a step back and try and like throw it towards the wall to see if it bounces off as well? Just in case it's like a, you know, lair barcode? Hey, we got through! Residual goo in my hand, I just like rub it all on my face. Single dig. Talk to it, my ass. She didn't want to talk to it. Oh! She was like three. I think there were like nine. For two rays? Maybe. Yeah, she just escaped with two Iphone 7's. If your highness wasn't smart enough to break another egg...
