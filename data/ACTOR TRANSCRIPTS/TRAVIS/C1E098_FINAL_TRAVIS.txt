Is that the shapes and pie-making game that you play in the kitchen bakery? I play Tim Garrick. Jay Garrick. I wear a tin pail for a helmet. The one Flash I don't know, really. Did they really make you do that? MATT and With a mask? They're in the booth, going (whispers) we're not getting any of this! Just draw a dick-butt on his forehead; it's fine. It's fun, you shoot things with a gun. Do you have to get the gun for it? Guess who's not here. Will Friedle won the first one, she won the last one. And how much was the debt? It was 260,000? Lydia! Is there like furniture to sit on, or is it barren? What is this bullshit, no ale? Should we pay him? We just found out he's dead fucking broke. Okay. (laughter) Really? You feel a doodie? The privy is over there! Or over there! Or the front yard beckons. I'm lost for the rest of this conversation. I carved my name into the floor. Wait, when you said we need to stop your family at all costs, are you talking about killing them? Can you describe to me this duty? I think I do now. Is it real hard? Adjectives are not my strong suit, so. Yeah. No, I got it one time at this tavern. I had it for two nights. It just itched everywhere. Copy that. Yeah, no, we're going out the front door. Front yard. Yeah, front door! Yeah, it's really tiny. Shit. Yeah, it's like how you have to buy something to use the restroom. Oh the guy with the sculpture? Wait, this is the meeting place of a dark group, right? A shady group? Shouldn't we check this area for anything shady? Over here, adventurer! I kill all of them. I'm in the back. I know. Taking a shower, I broke like two shower heads. Just turning around, I was like (crash). Oh yeah. My heels were just over like the-- Oh my god. Holy shit. Before we go any further, wait. Yeah, no, please. Fucking say some words! Still don't. I'm about to find out what the inside of a Bag of Holding feels like, I swear. Oh yeah! No, I just start weeping silently in the back. Yeah, no. You do that. Go by yourself. How about the talkers go to one table? The Defenders' Table. Yeah, so I'm going to the talkers' table. Yeah. Yeah, you got any pies or meat or both? Do they not have food? Yeah, meat pie and an ale, please. I thought you were about to shake his hand with two fingers. Are you sipping it? How's my meat pie? This is pretty good! Keep going. What's your confident face look like? More tongue. Little further. Yep. Little higher eyebrow on the right side. And I would like to make my way over to the goliath woman. Are there any weapons around her feet or where she's sitting or playing? Three. Me Grog! You play good! Nice hair. I'll be-- if you-- What? Nice boobs! Boots. Nice boots. Bidet. And I go back to the group. I have nice cups. Do you want a jewel-encrusted chalice? Yeah! I'm like fucking Bed, Bath, and Beyond in this bitch. Jewel-encrusted chalice. Not anymore, it's getting marked off now. We get up. I get up. We could watch you do it. That'd be pretty funny. Yes. Can I make my way back over to the players? Can I have your name? (louder) Can I have your name? Thank you, and I leave. (repeatedly, getting deeper) Yeah. (laughter) Nope. Headlong. (laughter) Yep. This is right up our alley. Like this is literally what we've been training for our whole lives. Roll high. Anything we should be worried about? Nope. Don't incant that shit again. Goldfish. Better. Why? If he has it, still. Ooh, that would suck because then we'd be in the ocean. Hey. In your face. What about just a location and she has to stay unseen? You know, I know Keyleth can scry and stuff but-- Yeah, but that was a year ago. I'm over that sentiment. Yeah. Yep. This is Grog evolved. Absorbed. Yep. Woked. Well, I think she needs to keep up her employment, right? Oh, yeah, that one! Who? What? Really?! Scanlan does?! That was very mean. I'm mad for an (stutters) a long time. Port Demali. Do we have any glow sticks that we could throw in and watch fall? Oh yeah, you can do that! We didn't land yet, right? Wow. Godzilla. Umber hulk? I ain't wasting that shit! We don't need it. How deep does the hole go? If it's a fucking baby ancient dragon I'm going to be stoked. That's 400 meters, y'all. Something from another plane. We know it's 400 meters down. Of the crawly ones? Yeah, because if there's hundreds, then-- We're going to need a fast exit. He wants us to take care of what the problem was. Nah. SAM and She really did. We're good. We've still got to camp for the night, right? Me! That's why I didn't take them. No, you don't. You don't. That's better. Yeah. You gave me a Fly coin. Well, that's bullshit. Yeah, I can jump 15 feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally. So not great. Like three squares. Will you sing "Jump" from Van Halen? Other people, I normally do. I turn into Nurse Betty almost in every fight. What are you talking about? But that's cool, you give it to somebody that, you know-- We're just spoiled for choice. Keyleth, did you roll 17 or 19 on your-- The circumference of this thing is massive. The diameter. Football field? Stay away from the walls. Yeah, do not come anywhere near the walls. You know, if we're not in a rush-- (deeper) if we're not in a rush, it might just be nice to send a little mini nuke down into the hole and see what comes out. Yeah, no, it's like reverse puberty. Just a reminder that I can't ride the carpet. Is it? Is it bigger than the first one? So I can get on there with everybody else? Okay. No, I'm... it's arguable. I'm definitely over 300. He's a big bastard. What? Yeah, watching you make fucking blondies. All right, this channel's boring. He's making armor. Ugh. What is that? So I just spend five feet of my movement? I'm Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation. Do it. Natural 20. 30. No, not yet. I halt the carpet 20 feet off the ground. Cool. Because insects don't love lights in the dark. The ancient platform? No, don't do that. Common. Giant? Eight. I'm sure we're going to try and talk to it, right? But it's just a baby! Yeah! Don't fight, play with this. Danger sense 18. Fucking molten lava! Oh, it was nice being over 250 for a little while. Do we stay on the carpet or are we knocked off? Your old friend, molten lava. Matt, can you point to where the cherub is? What does it take to activate the coin? Yeah? Just an action? It's the Jump coin, three times my-- Oh, damn. It's that whole shit, yo. All right. (grunts) I'm going to jump! And I would like to rage as my bonus action. And with my new Jump coin, I would like to jump with my Boots of Feral Leaping. It's three times my horizontal jump speed, which is 20 feet, so 60 feet. Oh, got it. Nice, that's fine. And can I jump towards the baby? Actually just to the right of the-- just over here. Yeah, right there. Nice. Do I have any movement left? Okay. I want to get right up on him. Never mind. I'm good. Rage, jump, no more action. Titanstone Knuckles? Next round. Okay. Oh, I do? I want to hit him. Great weapon master, reckless attack. That's a 26. Nice. 12. Where are you? I should have gotten this beforehand. Nice! Plus ten. 37. Oh, I get another one! 11, 24. Okay. Good to know. I whiff. That's it. I just have the two. Okay. Saving throw or just dexterity? I get two of those. That's better. 19. But that's my next turn. That happens on my turn. Can I get out of it if I'm buried in soil, though? Yeah! Like some unmotivated Spider-Man. Oh, is it really? Is it fucking really? Who put her on the top of a 40 foot wall? Channel Divinity. She rolled six sixes. I'm looking at them. Damn! 25. What do you got to roll, a 20? Percy, bless that shit. Did you just put-- Frozen no more! Freeze me at your peril! Yeah, nobody likes glitter. (muffled) I don't mean to be rude! Don't we need proof? I need help. I'm on the other side of the 40-foot wall from the carpet. They're going to chop it down as they mine the platinum. Straight up. Oh shit. Oh god, we did not-- pretty sure you said that last time, before you turned into Chef Boyardee. Nice! I did. For the second one. I'm okay. 12. 12. I spit in the hole. Nice! Add 100 to that and that's somewhere Grog. That cherub was a bitch. Was it?! Why you do this to us, chat? Everybody kill Keyleth. Yeah, we've got to get Hunger Games with this shit. Defend the cornucopia of loot!
