That was the bubbliest she's ever been over a three-month span. 20. I listened to it on my ride today. Your ads are funny. You introduce an ep, I introduce an ep. Yeah! Yeah.

TALIESIN and They're working on it. Chris is a Libra. His interests include underwater basket weaving. We can't go back. Yeah, you know, like one does. Fucking jauntily walk up. Thank you! Â Much better! Nope. Can you crush the tiny granules on the ground in between your fingers, if you try really hard? Yeah, I try real hard. 23. Me, too. Is there a sun? A point of light in the sky? The light appears ever-present. Strange. Ow. When this rest is over, do we know what direction we're going in? LAURA, MARISHA, and Jeez, not everybody at fucking once. All right. Shit. What does that mean? Thank you. Damn! (laughs) Keep it coming. I'm with Pike. Yeah, you will. Shit. (quietly) There is no spoon. Ticking them off, one at a time. Here we go. I like this. Let's walk with our eyes closed. I close my eyes and I start walking straight ahead. Eyes closed or open? Yeah, I did, too. Ow. I'm not going anywhere. I'm confused. I want to see what happens to those two when they follow. I'm there?! Hold hands? Like preschool? Okay. Eyes closed. Thinking about bacon. Pikey-poo. Might I ask, does Kord reside in Elysium? No. A lot of killing, disintegrating. Dawnfather. It was hard getting here. We'll take a picture and text it to you. Good start. Would you say Sarenrae's attractive? Yeah, that one. She's just beautiful. Yeah, no, she's beautiful. I'm keeping my little pearl from the beach. Yeah. We're going to need one, y'all gave yours back. It's just one! They make really tall things here. No, it's fruit! Souls don't grow on trees. What? One piece of fruit? One piece, just one little piece. An apple. We're in Elysium! Oh my god, please. Is there any fruit that I don't recognize? Something I don't recognize. 12. What? Pick this? No, why don't we say, are you a person? Nothing? Nothing. You want to check it for magic? Hey, Pike? What?! (laughter) What do I do with it? I already picked it! When have I ever worn a shirt? That's fair. All right. I will hold onto the pointy plum. Yeah. I have a feeling it's fucking fruit. Arizona or California? Basically we'll know Vecna's a god if another skyscraper forms in Elysium somewhere. Are you sure? Pure gold? Someone should go in and test out the light. I push Vax in. Do you know this tree? It's an Elysium tree, just saying. (laughing) Amicable tree. Weigh the nuts. Vindication! Yes! Oh my god. What did you ask him? Did you ask about the fruit? Guards. Best to let Scanlan and I take this. (laughter) Yeah, I knew that. Why didn't you just ask? It may give us an advantage. Really? 13. Wait, one more time. Don't steal his doors, or anything. What a terrible thing to say in the presence of the Dawnfather. Yes? But I don't ever-- oh, okay. Oh shit. (laughter) We seek the means to destroy him and all he stands for. (quietly) Shit. Oh god! Do you want that? Yeah, I would like to smash my gauntlets together and cast Enlarge. And rage. I'll charge one of them. And I pull the carpet out. Vax! Do something! We're rocketing up on the rug. Are we close to any of the other two that are at the bottom? She believes in me. She tries to teach me to use my brain, which I don't do very often. She tries to teach me to learn from the world. And she always cheers me on, which not a lot of people do. I believe in her. Holy shit, Super Saiyan. I take out the little pebble and I drop it on the floor. Shit. Is there a hole in it? No? Oh, those were the souls! Should've swallowed the rock. Oh my god. What the fuck! Liam, what did you say? Liam, we miss you! Ashley, we miss you! It's in an even bigger theater. We had an amazing time last time, and this theater is even larger, and will be mad, mad crazy.
