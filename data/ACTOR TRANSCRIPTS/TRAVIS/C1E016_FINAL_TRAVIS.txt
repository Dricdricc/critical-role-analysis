If you say it, it makes it true. Smash. I am Rushmore. We can do a live intro video. I'd been thinking that this had to happen at some point. We could totally do a Brady Bunch. You guys are on the bottom of the feed, right? So if you looked up and we looked down, we'd essentially be looking at each other. Oh, hi guys. And then everyone looks to the right to look at Mercer. Oh, we look right, you look left. TRAVIS AND Yeah, why not. You don't listen, anyway. Is the little magician halfling still being polite and brushing her teeth and stuff? Who you saved. Wuss. She's locked up. She's got tricks, though, right? That's all I needed to know. Cool. Could I try to further my beard? Yeah! It's a d20, right? Oh, that's right, that's right. The two in a row. I remember. I'm learning. I'm learning. Three. Eight. I'm a Targaryen, baby. (laughter) Yeah. Don't be jealous. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, crap. It's all right. It'll make me look really wise, you guys. Nobody will know. I'm all about it. Beads and bells and shit? Give me a staff and I'll be Gandalf. Wait! Ooh, weird. All right. It's really tight when you braid it like that. It pinches. Do it. Could be great. I thought you suggest violence. I'm gonna do a sleep check or something, right? I can't let him survive that. With disadvantage?! One. (laughter) I knew it! I knew it! I am a special boy. (laughs) (laughter) Thank you! I wave my head and it whips around. (sings) I whip my beard back and forth. So the weather outside is frightful? Oh, good diss. LAURA AND So are you saying you want what he has back? It is I, Brad Pitt from Legends of the Fall. (laughter) It's an old bard's tale. Oh my god, that was so good. That was so good. I don't know what you wrote, but it looked good. (laughs) So casual, her god. "It's cool. Go for it." I can't breathe. Festivus! Uh-huh. Ooh. Yeah. Yeah, we can burn shit for days. Ooh, yeah. Do they make you burn things as a display of your abilities? Shut up! You're a natural. You're great. We gotta go there. It's fire everywhere! Oh, good question. Is it copacetic? Exchange students. Like, didn't come back ever? Right, yeah. To which tribe? We did not know that. Yeah, no bigs, right? Just your mother. Do you think there's a chance of when we visit this place, we might have to defend ourselves? Look, my family is nice, too. We just share love with fists. It does, actually. Yeah, we should totally be there. And maybe ask them if they've seen your mom. How old-- when was the last time you saw your mother, or do you even remember? Wow. Yeah. Absolutely. It is, isn't it? She's warming up to me, I can feel it. Yeah. A day's rest? All right. Tiberius, you ever been here? How do goliaths do? Not wearing much. We have three other fancy robes. You do? It's huge on you. You want it anyway. I give you a colorful one. Be aware, we only have two left. Kima. (quietly) I love you. Scalebearer. I have a beard. (laughter) Is that her pops? Her pops? You don't have any arcane abilities anyway, right? Wink wink, nudge nudge. Or as Liam calls it, Sa-REN-rae. What? Like rooftops and shit. I like it. I love it. Overwatch. Yeah, you two up top. Yep, you and me. Smash hands. Scanlan? Overwatch. We have a UAV. Don't you have advantage? So we gotta be sneaky with that. So I'll put my spells in my back pocket for now. Taliesin's outside. Can we, though? Right. Dawn of justice-- Nice! Right. (whispers) Mention the Scalebearer. What did you do? No, we don't know who she is. That was cool. You were arrested. You hadn't done anything. Oh, okay. I know, I noticed. She doesn't love me, though. No, not yet. Tiamat? A book? Right. (laughs) Right? Good sell. Can we drop off this box, or what? I want to go see the fire dancers. There's nothing down there, right? Yeah, we'll do it now. Here we go. Here it comes. Son of a bitch. No, no. Only one of you. What did you roll, Sam? Really? (laughter) We've got to get you deceiving more. Oh my god. Amen. (laughter) Liam, you're up. I mean, (clears throat) Vax. You should re-cast that. Yeah, he's giving it to me. (laughs) That's true, I do wander off easily. (laughs) Hi. I know. Yeah. Just going to hit you in the face. Whoa. It fills up the room? He doesn't care. Very minty. I bet those are fun. I have darkvision, now with a range of 60 feet. No, no, let him do it! Let him do it. I hope you get your eyebrows burned off. Uh-oh. Yes! (cackles) (laughs) On Skype. 23. That was great. For a switch. Yeah, ladies first, perhaps. Well, get up there. Can you inspire? I would like to offer my beard for a rub of good luck. What? What did you do?! Is that a -1 to my confidence now? (cries) Good inspiration. We don't need it! We don't need it! Yeah, good. Nice shot! Yeah, we walk across. Cool. That was great work, though. That's amazing. It is. They are. Awesome. Can I turn to one of those (clears throat) Scalebearers and ask if they've ever dealt with any umber-hulks in this region. Right. That's important, isn't it. Burnt hair? Yeah, do it. Now let's vogue. This changes every time! Apparently. I do. I can also cast Flatulence. Doesn't it mess up the ground if we try to walk through it? Fuck, yeah. Just Wil Wheaton roll every time you do initiative. Yeah, Wheatoning. Wheatoning. 21. Oh, really? Get your head out of your ass. You gotta do what you gotta do. (laughs) Sorry. (quietly) Don't encourage it. (quietly) Hate it. I'd like to hold my turn. (quietly) It looks so pretty. Yep. Maybe we don't have to kill it, maybe they just (pfft). That's not depressing. Where are you going? Mm-hm. Yeah, are there any spider fangs we can put in the bag? Do you want me to hold onto them? I have them. I'm like a Wal-Mart over here. You could have asked me, but that's cool. No, no. I join him. I'm with you. Scanlan's already ahead of you. I move in as well. We're all going in. Yeah. Shit. I cast Terminix. Can I shift to her right flank, just at the corner of the mausoleum structure? Right there. Oh, shit. Natural 20. (cheering) Oh, the beard is still there. Its most majestic part fell off. Substantial Viking-ness happening. I am. Our side's the best! (laughter) Yeah, buddy. Yes. Let's go. Yeah. (falsetto) Levi-O-sa, not levio-SA. As you will. Not you. We've got to go. We've got to go. Yeah. What about on a ten? Must go faster. Must go faster. 21. Two. 12. No, bad car wash, bad car wash! What? (laughter) Next time, lead with that. No, I want to wear this pain as a remembrance of my beard. (tearfully) If you find the remnants of a glorious beard, preserve it. What? It is not the same. Right. You have a good time. Good going, Ashley!
