Yeah! Ashley Johnson! Blindspot! There are better ways to go. Worse ways. Whatever. Nope. He must have heard on Twitch and came running. (laughs) Man, I didn't get to masturbate in public. Justice League, Futurama, Pulp Fiction. Explosion. Brain matter everywhere. He is, it's great. Wow! Holy shit. I did. McLaren von Tosscobble. Oh, it was fun. He has secrets. And bourbon. He had lots of bourbon. You can do a rubbing on the front. Can I do a sleight of hand roll? Dicks. Tyriok, do you have a weapon on you? Yeah, right, on your way, lad. (whispers) He's going to die first. Yeah, I said he shouldn't come, but no-- You going to tell him? Yeah, that sounds legit. Oh really? That's a giant die. You know what that one does? It makes you infertile. Yeah, can you feel it in your little bits rumbling? They're all going to sleep forever. Look, I'm a man of the truth. All right, so we head towards the outcropping that looks like a gorilla's face. Perception check. First one! Ten. What?! Two deer. Santa Claus. Still flat grassland, or are there some trees? 26. 45, holy shit. From our previous time in the Frostweald, we don't recognize any of this terrain right? No landmarks, no lakes? Are there any paths in front of us, or is it just trees and intermittent terrain? Don't you like this terrain? Well, so what should we do? Number two and then number one. Follow them and then kill the rest. We follow them. At a safe distance. Good thinking. I kind of like it. Yeah, all your little Mr. Meeseeks will take care of them. No, no, hey look. I'm good for a distraction. Yeah, fuck it, just do it. Far side? Pike and I will go with Vax. Oh no, you're right, she should stay put. You're right. I'll go with Vax. Yeah, I was a 25. Yeah? Come with you? Go away from you? If you make a bunch of David the Gnomes-- You don't know me, you don't know what lists I have. I'm getting bored. A pit? If he says don't, then-- Holy shit. And 20. In his gerbil ball. Which one is he? I'm going to hold my turn until all of our party has gone. Okay, yeah, sure. Guiding Bolt. Yes! LIAM, LAURA, and 4d6? You roll her really well. Wait, are we at the top of the round? Watching everybody run forward, forming this delicious mosh pit right there in the middle, can I go into a frenzied rage? Can I book ass towards all these bastards and see if I can get close to this little prick? I have 50. I'm good! 20. Can I turn and say, all right, amateurs, time to go pro! And I would like to use Reckless Attack and with my frenzied rage, I take all three attacks at the crystal-bearing piece of shit. I can't hit him with my thing. He's just out of range? Whoever's the closest except for the bear. Oh yeah, he'll take it. He'll take all of it. So I have advantage on these and advantage on attacks. So do all the attacks first? Attack and damage, okay. 15 for the first one. Yay! Oh god, nine. 18! 18 points of damage. And there's a constitution-- Yay! Give me your shit. Okay, second one is a 24. No, 24 to hit. Yep. That's crap, nine. That's also 18 points of damage on the second one. And when I kill someone, I get an additional attack. Right, thank you. So this is the last one and there's a bear there, right? Hell, upgrades all around, bitches. Last one. 24. It's a plus three on top of everything else. Yeah. No, it's a plus one because we took a short rest, right? That wipes it. Right? Or a long rest wipes it. Craven Edge. Strength loss/gain from this feature lasts until your next short rest. So it's just plus one. I didn't want to! I'm not hit. I was fine! I was literally untouched. Yeah. Aggressively. 27 on the third one. That's the damage. Can I use it against the bear? Or just the person, is he the only other one in range? It was a 24. That was the damage, was 27. Yeah. Does he have to make a constitution-- Son of a bitch. That does. With advantage because he's hanging over a--? Yes! Totally. I'm at the bottom of the round. Yeah, please me too. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Good boy. Nice. Come on, give us a tickle. That'll hit. Misses. Yeah. That's 19, my armor class. Yep, both hit. Okay. Ten total? All this love for me, I'm flattered. And I would like to use all three of my frenzied rage attacks against the bear. First one, reckless, all three reckless, the first two normal, maybe the third Great Weapon Master, we'll see. 21. Yes. Awesome. Six, 11, 20, that's 20. Is that an automatic failed constitution save? But he's dead, right? So I killed somebody, so I get an extra attack, correct? Oh, it's the bonus. Beautiful. Yeah, I get it all the time! So can I turn to my right-- To the next bloke. The war chief, let's try the war chief. Regular, because I've just got two left so we'll see how regular does. 22. 18. The third one, let's do Great Weapon Master. Natural 20. 32. Before the modifier, it was-- I rolled a 12. Or no, it was seven plus five and then my rage modifier. Wow, which is ten now. And Great Weapon Master is ten. Yeah. Ten. No. 11. Not 11, 12. I would like to stick the hilt of Craven Edge into the snow and reach forward and grab his shoulders and pull him onto the point of the sword. Yeah, let's see the light leave those eyes. That's it, that's my turn. Holy shit. Ah! The golden snitch. No no, stay, we've got party favors. There's one on me. (laughs) "Gosh darn it!" Yeah! Oh, sweet, yeah, hold on. You hold one end, I'll hold the other. Wait. No, that might be something-- never mind. And I take out Craven Edge. I walk up to the orc that she's holding. Yeah, look, mate. So unless you want to bleed or lose the head that's attached to your body, are there more of you around these parts? He speaks fear. I get advantage on those because I-- 25. Have you had any dealings with the goliaths that are in Westruun? Anything else? Yeah, is there any reason why I should leave you alive? (laughs) I love this question. Before I dispatch you to your maker, have you seen a sphinx or a cave of magical origin around these parts? And I take Craven Edge and I grab both of his ankles, and I pull them apart and I shove the blade up under his grundle, and then rip one of his legs off. Yes! Plus four to attack and plus 11 for damage. Oh, score. It is now 21. Yeah, only for a little bit. 20. Seven from-- without the short rest, so it's been seven? Yeah. No, only 21, because it takes two to go up the thing, right? Oh. Oh. I'm at 24. I'm going to turn that plus four to a plus seven. Correct. So plus four is correct. I had plus four down. Okay, got it. Got it, got it, got it. On what I had normally. If I could ask, have you seen-- fuck, Wilhand? Yeah, Wilhand. Yeah. I drop down to my knees. You seem very brave. Do you know where Wilhand has gone? He's super cuddly. And I run over and I put Trinket in a headlock and give him a noogie. See? Totally nice. Here we go again. Oh, good call. Yeah? Yeah, of course, you're right. Yeah. Whatever you need. There's one standing behind you right now. Nobody saw that. Totally cool. All ale and wine is special. We do! That nothing is in! Some stuff is in it! Can I try and roughly butcher this boar? Not me, not me. But everybody inside's safe. Do it. What? Aluminum foil? Wow. Wow. I love your broom rolls so much. I would not remember that shit. Yes, thank you. They're dark as night, man, of course they do. No. I have one level of exhaustion, I'm okay. What's the second level of exhaustion? Okay. I want to see how far this can go. I want to push this. I'm willing to learn. Yeah, could I ask it one question? Right, it was a good day, right? Like, superb. Do you remember your former owners? Do you remember Lord Briarwood? How was he? Did he give you a goal? You know, before we put him into different pieces, he was, like, trying to build up this god called Vecna. You don't know anything about a god called Vecna, do you? No? Just the blood. Right, the hunger. But look, we did really good today. So I'm not going to go to sleep, I'm going to carry this over the next day, I want to see how hard we can push this. You're close to being full? Hold on, how many more lives do you need? Do you know, do you know what happens when you get full? Like, do you get bigger? Do I get stronger? You've got it. Can I insight check the sword? (clears throat) Two. (laughter) Outstanding. I tell you what, if you get full, we'll celebrate this upcoming day as your birthday. And that'll do me for the night. Really good. Yeah, I slept really hard. Lots of dreams. Yeah, we send them back towards the camp zone, right? (under his breath) Infertility. What? Yeah, no, look, the sand pit was, I think I need to comb it after you use it. What? There's a training area downstairs just for me. I haven't been using it. Yep. Yeah, I mean, like, I had my way with a few of those imaginary friends, because, man. No. It was good. Good sleep. Real, a little sore in my back. Oh right, the Frost-weald. I have darkvision. Yep. So in this room, it's a circle, what's the distance across the room? Oh, so it's not that big. And there's solid flooring and then the pool in the middle. Can I take a single gold coin, make a wish, and flick it into the wishing well. I also have two vials of breathing underwater. You did? Fricking awesome. You got it. I come down behind her. Oh, sorry, no, I'm being a dickhole. It is five, yeah. Can I look everywhere except the tunnel with my darkvision? Don't worry about it, it's four. (underwater blubbing conversation sounds) I'll swim forward. Just to where it starts to curve up. That sucks dick. At a disadvantage? 12. Oh, that's right. 12. 11. That's a one. (gasping) If it's water. Okay. It's like a reverse beer bong. (coughing and choking) I'll go first because I'm at disadvantage on everything, so. Hold it up, show him. I definitely roll. How does Scanlan land? The worst! We all know what you're talking about. You haven't lived. That can't be what this is about. That's what she said last time. Can I walk over to one of the pillars? Is it covered with anything? Is there writing or anything fancy on the pillar? Hey! 15 with a minus two. Can I knock on it? Ooh, ooh, fire, fire! Oh! A fucking hourglass? (yelling) It's a robe, it's not a rope. It's from the inside of a robe or jacket. I give it. No, not 27, 24. Second roll was 11, 19 total. Except I'm exhausted, right? So I have disadvantage anyway. 21. 21. Perception is four, but I rolled a 24 on my fourth-- How about a short rest? (laughter) Yeah, thank you. Fuck, I've never rolled that well in my life. Wait, so we went through water, we went through sand. I'm okay with that. Yeah, I'll take it. Oh, fuck that shit, I'm rolling through. In the walls and in the floors and in the ceiling, is it just the same marble and stone, are there any porous openings or--? 16. It's stone, though, right? Like marble, or? What do you see, Percy? That was good. The hell's a celestial? It is in bold print. Is it just me, or does that one in the middle look like a fire pit? We have some boar in the frozen bag. The last time we did that, shit went down. Well, can we walk over to the cauldron first and see what's above it? I like it. You want a hand? Can we look at the ground for (laughs) for traps as we're walking? Any squares that might move? Yup. Nine. No, we're good. All the elements are there. Fucking Dwarven Forge, man. 14. Fuck. With disadvantage, 13. What does that mean? Hit him! There's spiderwebs, there's stones, there's fire, there's water-- Okay, this should be fun. We're all standing around with our thumbs up our asses. 11. Disadvantage. What the fuck? (laughs) I know. Paint chips. I made a bad call. There's also the obelisks. We got to go start touching the other shit. It was all written in what, in--? Oh. I was going to rage and shake it, but-- I can shake that with a rage. Thank you, Pike. You got it, buddy! I might as well do what Pike says. I'm going to bum-rush the sphinx. Yup. Sure. Two strikes, straight-up. (laughs) Yeah. I'm not smart, this is all I do. 23? His face is awful. Should I roll damage or roll both attacks first? No, that's true. 24 on the first one. Second attack. Holy shit, that's a 28. Something's going to happen to me and it's going to be bad. Six. 11. 23. So I'm at 25 now. And I don't go up again until 26. Right? On the evens. Oh, you're right, yeah. (laughs) Super Saiyan, motherfucker! 2d6 necrotic damage? Okay. And I'll stay there. And await my punishment. Is half? 21, so half 21 would be 11. Maybe say it in Celestial. Oh, at disadvantage? Which saving throw? (laughs) Five. Oh, but I'm raging. Got you. 17. It screws a high roll. What's the Celestial word for time? K-A on the door? Oh yeah. You know what this means, right? Jump in the fire. Rumpelstiltskin. The element is going to be a quarter of the letters. Do it, do it. Why? Was that sarcastic? (Grog voice) It was lost on me. Your subtle humor is lost on me. Don't miss the beginning of the 50th episode. Natural 20? Oh, shit. Yeah. I run over to Scanlan. How jacked-up are you? Are you? All right. Then I run down the steps and I jump into the tornado. (laughs) There's a couple of lines. Can I grab my earring and say what I see? Can I take my Chain of Returning and attach it to Craven Edge and throw it through the doorway that I see? 23. Damage, oh, damage. Sorry, damage. I rolled the wrong thing. Please don't let it be Pike. Nine. 14. 30. I crawl through the door. Can I run to Pike? That's my turn. Can I respond? Nine. Yeah. So ready for a nap. 24. If that's happened twice, they're 20 years older. Ten. Yeah, I never shook it, still in a rage, but never shook it. Deafened? We've both seen it, we can't say shit. Wait, didn't I have Freedom of Movement? Oh, Pike! Nine. At a disadvantage. I look down at Pike. Pike, buddy, are you all right? And I call out, the letters inside the wind are O-R-I. I turn, I face the sphinx, and I don't do anything. Craven Edge is on the ground, right? That's it. That's all I do. (chokes) Okay. 16. We're all laughing and one of us is unconscious. Yeah, I turn around and grab the thing that's strangling my neck like a dog leash and I yank it in real hard. Fucking shit. I thought it was going to be like a gentle education, like a gentle ribbing. Matt, that was-- A crazy-ass puzzle. I'll make a copy of it, I'll make a copy of it. Advantage on attacks? Holy shit. Yep. We're cool.
