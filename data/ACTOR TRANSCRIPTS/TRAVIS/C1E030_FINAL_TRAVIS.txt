Yes, you should! I got the unicorn walnut wood. I'm getting crumbs in my bosom? Like cookies in bed. He's here. He's just getting ready. Chicken heart. Do I get advantage all night? I'm Helga the angry tavern wench, and I only love one man Scanlan. Oh that is some 'stache love. Dirty, dirty 'stache love. Do you have a comment about my perfect breasts and the shortage of them? Oh no! Careful, they are expensive. I don't know, I feel as groggy as ever. We were very discreet and discreetly putting the Dust of Tracelessness on the ground. One down, how many left? How many are there left? There are five total? Whoa, I did math. Walls, or the false ground? Jeez, you're the worst. Are you afraid you're going to hurt us? I think that sounds fair. She would. Three. Well, look. It's going to help him on his quest, get revenge and kill all the people that killed his family, right? So can we do that, and then if it gets out of control, we bop him on the head and take him to a temple? I mean, you were really awesome in that last fight. A little bit of pee came out. It was that good. He said take his tongue. I do, too, Pedostache. Are you saying for your final bullet, you want us to stop you? You don't want to scratch the name off the barrel? I'll knock you out if you really want me to. Yeah. Okay. Shall we rest and then we go find another house? Yeah, let's go to the barracks. Yeah, let's go there. Percy's got it, yeah. I'll take second. Percy. Fine. I take the Flaming Warhammer, and I whisper the magic word, bacon. And it turns on fire. Oh, that's a good question. No, it looked like it was coming from the bottom up, and there's only two holes down there, so it's either-- Either the dirt button-- It's probably the periscope. You're right. It's just cold. Can I do a nature check to show them it's just fucking fog? A 13. What if they didn't hang the bodies, the tree just grabbed people? 17. 17. That hits. That misses. Okay, really? Nice! Wyrmwood Box. I would like to rage. (laughter) And I would like to take my Firebrand Warhammer and pound that shit to the left of me twice in the head with my fiery hammer. Oh, yeah. That is a 15. And that's a one. It's so difficult. 16. Shit. Nine. Misses. Misses. I forgot I have advantage on strength checks when I'm raging. A one. You have the sage, still? Fucking hit him this time, will you? Do you have morning-- Okay, so it's probably going to go everywhere. Like a battleship. He has the best old man laugh right now. Are you writing your name with your left hand? Wow, way back. I want to hammer in the morning, and I want to pull my hammer out of the wall. Yay, that's better. That's a 28. Can I use the great weapon master on these attacks, and I'll use reckless attack for advantage on them, and anybody that attacks me gets advantage, as well? Thank god. 21. Beautiful, and the second one. That's landed on the side. That's 24. (sings) Yeah, nipples. The one that's next to me! 14 and 15, so 25 for the first one. (sings) Stanky. (giggling) 29. Yeah! Nope. Actually, I'll put my back against the wall. Yes. To open it up in case somebody wants to take a shot at him. Yes. That hits. Okay. What? Oh, you and I have been together. Did you see? I carved that in with a pen, myself, after our night together. Where have you been my whole life? Take my eyes, not my penis. Whoa! Damn! Bonus action. Stake. That was so CSI Miami, man. What's up, toothy? Bite me. Constellation Urine. Chest bump! (impact sound) So newsflash the fog is bad. We probably need a new hideout. Nope, no, we killed them all. I know. Yeah, we step outside, it's game on. Until he betrayed us and tried to eat Scanlan's brain. We decide to stay. We stay. No we're not. We'll be fine. Yeah, we can. I guess I'll allow it. Half-elves, what what. Fuck it, I'll do it. We play hand slaps. (impact sound) Fuck. Claws catching every once in a while. You're welcome. No problem. 11. You don't know. Thank you. Do we want some dried food rations? I have a ton in the bag. I have a question. My 11 points of permanently lowered hit points from the necrotic damage, can that be healed with a potion of greater healing? Literally what I just asked. Literally what I just asked. Are we going to find another house to kill now? I mean, to carefully investigate and thoroughly due diligence the heads before we smash them. Yeah, we've got to find a different spot. Different-looking peasants. What's the safety word? Doritos. Married. I'm taking this wig off. Sit down, you dickless wonder. (laughs) Oh? I've moved on from Scanlan, and I've cut my hair as a sign of change. Yeah, Aliens. Such a badass, Vasquez. No, it's the best. We're going to the Alcove. Kerrion. Got it. He's really good at charades. Should've broken his fingers, too. We don't give a fuck. We're walking around. We don't give a shit. You people have got lazy eyes. We've got a donkey. No problem. Recognize us, I dare you. He lives at the castle? Can somebody see if there's something watching? Monitoring? No blue poo. Got it. Just drop that phat name of yours, buddy. Yeah, it's Museldorf Musketeers-- You can call him Percy. What does the ceiling look like? That's where we need to be tonight. Remember when we were in the branches? We are allies. With us comes change. Keep our secret and all the better we'll be for it. It was that good. Did we recognize the guy that was talking? I elbow Percy, and I go, do we talk to him? (whispers) Drop Seeming. Drop it. Are there windows in the room? You should show him. If we were to continue working our way up this totem pole, which of the two is less powerful? Count Tylieri. And in your time, do you know anything about Lady Delilah? What she is? Lady Delilah. I think she's a bitch. Nope! Can you actually write letters in them? That's a good point. We'll remember that. Let's go pick a fight with a house! It's a good ranged stink. All right, can we do something now, please? What time is it? Whenever you're ready. Grog always wants to play! Fuck it. I rage. No, I took off running. Activate the flaming warhammer. TALIESIN and Oh. 14. I'll meet you in the middle! Yeah. You want to send him in with me? It's going to be nasty where I'm going. It's all-day buffet. Damn it. (laughs) Some magic item.
