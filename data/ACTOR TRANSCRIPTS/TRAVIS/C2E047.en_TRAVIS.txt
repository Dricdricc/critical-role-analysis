2019! It's that empty in there, huh? Where's the wave? There you go! If you lose, will there be a concession speech? Oh, okay. Sitting at his desk, paranoid, looking over his shoulder now. It's just straight wisdom. That's all it is. Leave it on. Please, leave it on. I want to have a dramatic interaction with that, please! Oh shit, just getting in it. Did you really? That's amazing. That's totally an Ashley roll. Jesus. SAM and Under the sea-- Yeah, we sent in the dead guy through that door. Is it just on the other side of this greefy. Greefy? Sure. I like the water. I like the water! We should kick up a bunch of sediment and hide! What? We did coming up to this. I think it's been ten minutes. Damn! Pay attention! Nobody 20 to 15? 12. LAURA and Yasha rolled a seven. Sorry, Ashley. (laughing) That is such a benign "Correct." Sure, nothing wrong here in the middle of initiative. I mean, clearly the top is the damage, right? Well, I mean, they're big we think, right? They're not going to come through that little door, right? The crustacean things. Of which, I think there are three. It was. It's further around than you think. Six foot? What the hell is coming off of it? Yeah, we fucking see it! Natural 20 for Fjord. A 13 for Yasha. I'm going to use my 30 feet of movement with my mariner's armor, and I'm going to move north on the map as far as I can. Great. I will, with my bonus action-- I'll keep it for now. I don't know what else is in there yet. I'm going to fire off two Eldritch Blasts at his bitch ass. That's a 12. Probably won't hit. Damn. And a 15. Ooh, thank god for that. Ten points of Eldritch Blast damage. What is that? What the hell is that?! Oh jesus. If we hit it, do you think it might break the grapple? Yasha will advance on el aqua screecher gentleman, and she will unleash two swipes with the Magician's Judge. With her bonus action she would like to rage. Because of Bless. 18 to hit? First one hits and the second one, 19? The third one is 3d6. 15 points on the first one. On the second one-- that's not great. Eight points on the second one of slashing damage. Sorry, ten points. Add two more on that. They do. I'm not, but she is. Yeah. That is a 19 for the first one. Second one, that's a natural 19. It does. Oh, shit, it's already me? Ah! Yeah, I know. Yeah. I don't know if I want to get that close to it. That thing is grappling-crazy. Can I kick up 15 feet and back 15? Away from the target. Yeah, I'll take it. I will again throw two Eldritch Blasts. That's a natural 19 and-- The guy on the lower. Natural 19 is 26 to hit on the first one, and the second one is a 19? Okay, great. Lots of dice for two different characters. Nine plus five, 14 on the first one and 13 on the second one. Nice! Those are good. With my bonus action, I will do nothing yet. So this guy down here at the bottom? He was just hanging out, slow-playing that shit? You son of a bitch. I don't like his face the way he said it. He's going to turn on you. You're going to have two on you. Natural three and natural five. Right. Yeah, she is going to deal with the-- what are these called? We don't know. She's going to deal with Carl right in front of her. Reckless against these sons of bitches. Straight attack. Okay. Sorry, here I go. 18 to hit. Okay, and the second one I'll get out of the way. That's a 22, that hits. 23. All damage is doubled on the first one? It's 3d6, so that's (counting) 17. What's 17 times two? Second one. Yeah. Five, seven, plus three is ten. 12 points of slashing damage for the second one. Both of them, or just one? Are you grappled by both? Smoke bombs. Something. That helps a ton. I love that they wrote it out that specifically. Is that going to turn him back around on you? That's okay. I think that's actually better. Keep him going. MATT and Fjord will take all 30 of his speed and head towards the two lumberfucks that're messing with Beau. I'd like to get down there, if I can. Could I? I'm going to send-- and one of them's stunned, right? I'm going to take two swings with the Summer's Dance falchion at the stunned one that just let go of Beau. They stay at advantage because of my Mariner's Armor? 15, that's going to hit. That's 30. Yeah, I mean, that hits. That's 37 without the-- Ooh god, double fours plus 12. 16, 20. 11 on the first, seven on the second. 18 points total. With my bonus action-- oh, I should have done it first, but I'm fucking stupid. Look at that. I wrote it there, in big letters Cast Hex. Goddamn it. I'm only governing two characters right now! Fuck me. Can I cast it with a bonus action? Yes. With my bonus action, I'll cast Hex and get it up now. On the stunned one, please. It'll have disadvantage on wisdom checks. You're wearing Cowboys colors. It's fine. Take your time. Everybody is ready to be out of the water. This is the first time? She's raging; I think it's okay. Both hit. Okay. 15 damage. Constitution saving throw. Does she have advantage on-- no. Okay. Oh, she's great. 24 plus-- 26. Yasha's going to try and get to Red Lobster with two more swipes of the Magician's Judge. Reckless for straight attacks. Okay. What doubles? Oh, great! Okay, cool. 16 to hit? Oh, nice, and the second one is only an 11-- oh, wait. An 11 plus four. 15! Damn it! But the first one does. That's good. Okay. Sweet. (counting) 19 times two, so 38? Yeah, sweet. She will come down in an overarching right with that Magician's Judge, and on the second one she'll shove the sword in and crack that fucking thing like a beautiful fillet. (as Yasha) So many people leave so much good food in here. Got to know how to eat lobster. She'll take her 15 feet towards the other two. Can she get on his ass? Nice. Natural 20. You'll only know if it's Inception or not if it falls over at some point. Crap fire! What in tarnation?! Hasted Nott, man. It just wants to live. I'm worried about Caleb. Okay, let's do it. I'm going to grab Beau's arm and go Come on, first mate, and cast Thunder Step. Take the falchion and shove it into the bottom of the ocean. We're going to come to Caleb's aid right here. Does that sound good? And right behind me. All right, there you go. That's 3d10 plus Hex. A constitution saving throw. Yes. Yeah, that saves. It takes half. That's 20 solid, so just ten. Ten points. Cool. It's only within ten feet, and I think Yasha's 15 feet away from where Fjord was. Awesome. With my bonus action, can I transfer my Hex to that fuckstick? Oh sorry wait, d6 for Hex. That's six. Yeah, because I cast Hex on that bastard. Thank you. You're right. Never mind. No, that's okay. Let's go now! Let's go! Yeah! It's a spell, so there's no disadvantage right? Yeah! It's like, "What's up over here?" That's okay. We've appreciated it this entire fight. You found that fast. You're turning into Mercer. I can't find shit in that book! Put it up top, Widogast! Can she peek in the doorway? Not that she doesn't think all of her friends can't handle it, but-- I was like, no, I'm not killing Ashley's character! Cool. Yes. That'll drop her rage, too. Back, you! It was a 20 for two seconds. The club punch. Bitch! Walk away with some weave in your hand. A little slice? I don't know if I believe you. Actually, if we went inside, then at least anything that's swimming overhead with big teeth might not see us. That would be great. Yasha, do you see anything in there? (quietly) No. (laughter) Error 404! Deuce, do you want to take a look, make sure that it's not the ravenous variety? I'll help Caleb over to the door. Yeah, we have 24 hours of breathing, so we're okay. Yeah, let's get inside. Jester, that was very impressive, I must say. And the use of the lollipop. Really nice stuff. We'll be inside. Yasha's back up to full. Careful as you head out there. You don't know what's above you. I don't want to disturb the fauna. Is there a more genteel way to make our way through? Jester, you find anything on that guy? No pendants or necklaces or keys? Yeah, let's do that. Yasha will help you pull the body back in. Who, Yasha and her? I don't mind. All right? Is there any jewelry or pockets or stuff on it? Keys? I'm real good at these. That's cocked. That's worse. 11, no, yeah, 11. Let's pick it up. Maybe we can offer it as a gift to the (slurping) as we make our way down. Okay. Are you grabbing the tendrils? Ugh. Caduceus, you okay with us chunking this into the-- What? I meant we were going to toss the body into the seaweed and let it have a snack. Oh okay, I thought it was the gnarly kind. Oh, okay, never mind. Sorry, I misunderstood. Hello, bees. (chomping) They're very smart. I've seen a place like this once before, when we were in the temple previously with Avantika. If you will help me, you could search the floors and the walls for any sort of recessed sphere shape. I think it needs to be about yay big. Well, if we find we something that looks like the previous situation, then maybe we could send some of us out of here before we put the key in the lock. No. As far we know. I don't think it will. I don't think so. I think it's to get the three spheres in the three temples. She did hers and died. I have the second and the third, but that's my logic. I must concede, I don't know how many temples there are. I'm only going off of that art that we saw in the temple. Now, unless there's two holes in here. There should only be one, in theory. No. How do I do that, Jester? Does he answer you when you talk to him? He does? Would you ask him if he knows anything about this? I don't know what agate is. What does agate look like? It's a see-through glass, or is the same color? Well, I figured we're in a safe-ish space. I don't know. We can do it on the ship. My question to you-- oh. They could see us through the glass sphere? That's okay. We can do it on the ship. With that crazy investigation check of yours, did you find any recessions in the floor? Just one? I don't recognize that armor, do I? Does he look like his appendages are all attached? Any cracks on the skull or face or any sort of-- Me? Yeah. Hey Jester, could you make a-- Thank you. Natural 20! Maybe it got crushed by the pincers and then crawled down here where they couldn't follow. I think I need to do it alone. If I'm going to risk getting out quickly, I don't want you to have to do the same. There's only one recession in here, so one sphere. I do have my mariner's armor. I have my normal speed. Sure. I don't think there's anything else to do. (background music) I'm not going to turn evil! I'm not going to turn evil. I rub my cut earlobe. Now look. I think we're overthinking it, right? Same as before, I anticipate some crazy arcane stuff to activate. Maybe a little rumble and a shake. You guys have been more than accommodating. You don't need to be down here with me when it happens. If something does go wrong, that should be my burden, my price to pay, not yours. I don't think it will, and only because, if Uk'otoa really wants me to do all of this for him, what good would trapping me down here do? I have the third sphere. I don't think he's going to hamstring me like that. No, I don't, but I wouldn't gum up the one person that was bringing me the thing that I needed to get out of demigod jail. Yeah. I'd like to. I don't know what that looks like. I don't even know how that'll go, but I don't want to release a sea-snake beast on the world. Yeah. Yeah, fair enough. If you hear the signal, take off. You remember the signal, right? (choked screaming) Can I go and sit down right in front of Jester? Well, what'd he say? Kind of. You had a little projection on it, yeah. Jester. You don't have to tell me, it's fine. I appreciate the sentiment. It's okay, you can go. Me too. Or anyone else? Just you? Deal. All right, get going. I don't know what that does. I will kneel down in front of the recession and I will look at the eye that's in the pommel of the falchion. (different voice) Let's see what this does. And I'll place it in the recession. Time to go. I'll head towards the tunnel. I rolled a seven. Where is the ship? Jester, I didn't know you could mess with water like that. No? Oh, I'm forgetful. I mean, it worked. Would I know if I got something new? Do I know what it is? I mean, I can try. I'll reach my hand out towards the sea and lift up my hand. Cleaning herself on her balcony? Yeah, I think we're good. Make for the coast, Orly. We've had enough time at sea. Really cool shit. What the hell is durian? Yeah. (mouth full) What is that? (garbled noise) (laughter) Ugh. On a course to intercept? Starboard, port? No, we're dropping all the sails. We're getting the fuck out of here, and I'm going to use Control Water to push the back of our boat out the fucking archipelago. North. Northeast, the way-- I imagine that's the closest one. If there's a closer opening, yeah. Yeah. Make ready the cannons. Yeah. What's the distance from the ship? If we had to guess it? Okay. I have no idea what's an appropriate range. We couldn't just get to land, goddamn it. (clears throat) Just kidding. Taliesin, do you have any idea what the range on a cannon is? 120 or 480. Okay. We have seven cannons. I am reading this card! (muttered reading) Each of us get two what? Right, which is a singular cannon shot with additional loads of powder. Seven. Four on the port, three on the starboard, but we don't know which side they're on. Are we both facing the same direction right now? So are they on the starboard right now? Yeah. (sighs) Run or fight, say it now. What do you want to do? Yeah, I did, but you've already risked a lot for me. We'll see how fast they are. We'll turn to flee into the water. Yes. Probably faster? 14. Oh, she got a three. No, five. 15. What? The ship had a 15. Mine's not. It's up for ten minutes and it's at the back of the boat. Oh, well, there you go. Yep. I have no idea. I don't have any visual of where we are in relation to anything. The coast off to starboard? No, we're still out of range. We're still out of range by 300, 400 yards. Sure, yeah, let's aim to hug the coast on the starboard side. That is a three. Negative two to survival checks, y'all. No. Five, yes, so three. Is our hull at full strength? Okay. I got that. How close do you need them? Uh-huh. We're hugging the coast. We're going to continue in that same line. We need 480, anyway. With a tidal wave? Yeah, it's a wave. No. I'm glad we went through all that so I could get that spell once a day. Make it so. Turn to port. Prepare to fire. Smoke these motherfuckers! Yeah, after we splinter the ship. They obviously had some sort of wind in their sails. I mean, they've got some arcane people. They'll be fine, if the can survive this barrage! Yeah, there was a 70 percent chance it was going to fucking fail, and we were going to turn to port and get into it. We're realizing the amount of hours that must have gone into the detail of this. Because I'm reading into targeting the helm or the sails or the cannons... They tried their hand at a new occupation! Oh, I'm so glad... (nervously) No! It can't be! We even did another job! Nice call, Taliesin. Nice call. Do you want to go close and toss out a rope for a couple? How many manacles do we have? I don't fucking know. How many manacles do we have? Master gunner? We'll be okay. I forget, do we have any firearms, or did the Plank King dock crews clear all that out? It's not like they've got-- I'm sure they're not swimming-- well, we'll see. Let's get them up. Fortunately, you found us on a day of mercy. You have a second chance at life. Is there anywhere you would like to go? I am. Captain Tusktooth. 'Til the end. That's a better name. Better name. We planned to make our way for the Menagerie Coast. Do you have any objections with that? Excuse us a moment. Yes, master gunner? You mean Nicodranas? Yeah, but we're betting on the fact that they do. I think, if we go into Nicodranas, we need to be as stealthy as possible. There's a chance they might not take it. We should probably drop them off at the island, give them some food. We'll go into Nicodranas stealthily. That's my fear. I like the way you're thinking. I can. I don't know if I want to risk it. Orly, make for the shore of the nearest archipelago coast. Yeah, just going in. No rowboat. How about one stays on deck, and he's going to carry the canvas sack with some food rations. In order to eat, you've got to get the mark. It's not optional. How about his face? What, you don't want a unicorn pooping on his face? Oh, my fault, Jester. Oh, Jesus. Well, he's covered in most places, so pick your spot. Give them the food. Beau, will you show him the door? I actually don't need to dive down there. I can't breathe water again for another-- until we have a long rest. Orly, can we set a course for Nicodranas by way of Brokenbank? Oh, just going by the normal trade routes, just in case we, I don't know, run across any trouble. How are we on supplies? Food, water? Anyone sick, hurt? It's the next stop on an established shipping lane. If we're set, I think maybe a speed route would be great. Nicodranas. Nice. I'll throw in some Control Waters once every day. Caleb? That's it. I think that's the plan. Caleb, you want to take time to Identify your goodies? Not too shabby. They die before we reach the shore. What? No. Kidding. (laughter) He jumps over. I would. I would like to ask Beau and anyone else that lives in the empire if they could tell me a little bit more about where they live and who is the most concerned about the news that we received about the war moving south. He's looking stuff up. You're from...? Right. We came through the Wuyun Gates? Right here. Maybe we'll just see. It's at the discretion of everyone. Once we're off the boat, I'm not the captain anymore. I don't know where the urgency lies. Even with an army bearing down on it? You have family there. Warn your folks? Get them out of harm's way? No? Beau, I want to honor what you've said, but you only get one family. Are you sure that whatever's transpired between you is too much to drop a note? You have a brother now. No other siblings. Aren't you at all concerned that he might be an innocent in all this? He has your blood running through his veins. Maybe think about it. Him, at least. Could give the kid a chance. You'll know what to do. No, I think we're fine for a while. My first priority was getting Jester back to her momma for a hot minute if we could. I think we're pretty sneaky. We've learned some tricks. Wouldn't hurt to check out the fucking building that grows and shrinks as you approach it. If we're heading up into the empire, we got to go through the Wuyun Gate anyway. Yeah. In searching the captain's quarters, would we have discovered any sort of papier? Yep, all right, well-- Or we go full sail into port, crash into the docks, Caleb sets off Fireball as a diversion, we run in and hide among the corpses of the innocents that are scattered about. I have a problem. (laughter) Yeah, I'm good. No. I did have another vision. It seemed like Uk'otoa was straining against whatever confines it was in, but not released. I saw a vision of another, maybe final, temple location. I saw a shore with three cities along the coast, and then a forest beyond that. Just before you got to a rocky mountain ridge, there was a single glowing light-- It could be. I don't really care, for now. No, and the thing I wanted the most was-- in some of these, I saw a vision of Vandran, whether as a statue, or in a reflection, or something. I didn't see anything. Nothing. I've run out of leads there. I don't really know where that leaves me on that, but we've spent enough time on me. I don't have anything else to follow. Besides, there's danger coming. Maybe we let a little bit of time go by, but thank you. Not yet. I feel like we're good for a while. I couldn't tell you why. We'll see. It might be good to ask anyone if they know anything about Uk'otoa, or if there are offsetting deities or gods. He seemed incredibly powerful, and I have to admit I was a little unnerved seeing him push against his constraints in that way. I don't know. Maybe there's more to be learned. Just those single words. He says things like "learn" and "adapt". Could be. Yeah. I summon it. Yes, yeah. Take it up into the Empire by way of Nicodranas. No, no. And if I can, I'd like to find some way out of it. Yes, I like how I am now, and to answer your question I have no idea. I've only been in its favor. I don't know what the other side would be like. Yeah. No? I don't know. (chuckles) No. I'm out of my depth. I have no idea, I don't know any more than you do. All I know is I'm ready to get off the sea for a bit. Unless I hear otherwise, all's well. No reason to assume otherwise. He's the most sterile he's ever been. And you hear (cannon firing) as we give away our location. Yeah, of course. Fuck off. (laughter) Ah! My back's popping. An instant fucking big-ass tree? It's like a ladder. Caduceus does, I do. LAURA and Does it come with any protective--? I don't remember much. Yeah, we'll hold it for Yasha. I bet it's giant. Yasha drinks it immediately. No. Whoa. That's a thing. That took me a long time to get to that. Should we get to work on forging those documents for when we make our way in? The mote? The shred of fate, or whatever? I was like, when did we start calling it the mote? Yeah, but we don't need any sort of official record tying us-- Orly. In no less than 30 words, describe to me why you should have this ship. Further inland. What I think I'm saying is the ship is yours once we reach Nicodranas. You can sell it, you can take care of it, whatever you see fit. You've done right by us. That sounds quite agreeable, Orly. That'll be all. Bring him with us. Make him fight! (as Orly) No worryin', now. Yeah, fluffy little clouds. (stuttering) What? (whispering) What the fuck? Leave it to Taliesin to trip you out with shit you didn't know about. (laughter) Oh man. That was awesome. I'm sorry that we capsized the boat so fast!
