I have the hiccups! I will! We're both in Telltale's the Batman series, which is great. Laura plays Catwoman. I play Harvey Dent. Episode two released last week or the week before. I think it was last week. It's really great. It's on major consoles, PS4, Xbox One. You can get it on your phone now, too, so check it out and watch us be a part of the Batman rogues' gallery. Yeah. And save Harvey Dent. Don't worry about Catwoman. She's a piece of cat poop. You can look forward to that kind of writing. It's pretty sweet. I played it a bunch. It's really great. We're basically in all the video games, you guys. Yeah, we're going to come to the line that you would go to if you vote because we know which ones you're going to be at. We'll shake your hand. We're going to be there for each one of you. Individually. Like Santa Claus. I move behind Keyleth. You're sure that Thordak has a cure for you? What about the white dragon? Which side is it? All right, I love a good story, so do you have a plan? I have a question. Do you want to talk to Thordak's dead spirit, or are you after the big shiny jewel in the middle of his chest? Insight check to see if he's lying. 18. Yeah, sure. He's telling the truth. She's telling the truth. Yeah, do you wear his clothes, and use his soap, and brush with his toothbrush? That's a lot of attitude to what I feel is a simple question. It's gross. Please, go ahead. Sounds like a job for me. (spits) Come on. Spit smells funny, you know. Wait, will Thordak know if we do something to Vorugal? Why? I would also say that if she wanted to set a trap with three dragons on us, they would all be here right now. No, don't provoke-- Come on. Even my simple mind sees the advantages here. You're going to get yours. You're going to get it. Oh. Yeah. Wait a minute. Why the length and bread of Whitestone? Are you fully aware of what lies beneath Whitestone? Yeah, if you've seen it, tell us what it is. How big is it? If you've seen it. (laughter) Shit! She's seen it. We can kill her whenever. Might as well use her. I walk up very gingerly to Keyleth, and I grab one of her antlers very gently, and I say Look, if you want to go, we're with you, but if you exercise a little patience, I think we'll get more out of this, and you'll still get yours in the end. Don't get me wrong, I want to crack it open right now, but we'll get more later. Wait, you said he's building a volcano? And you said you knew Thordak before he was trapped in the elemental plane. Was he, in any way, on what is now known as Glintshore before the elemental plane? Maybe if he can heal you. I'm confused. Go ahead, or do you want to save it? No, don't. I say we agree on principle. We agree-- I agree. Hands? To fight with Raishan. You're abstaining? I really wish you would vote. Your vote matters. No, you actually sway the vote in greater ways than you can possibly imagine. Very important. I'm sure the internet has all your answers. We need a moment. I feel like the emotions in here are a bit raw. Can we please? Let's be honest, there's nothing-- That's not a 20. Holy shit. I was alive for that. I was alive for that just now. The glasses didn't help, either. Drop it on them. No, tell them your plan. How many Vestiges are left? LIAM and Yes? I got this. All those yanks. Barely heard you coming that time. What would be wrong with summoning it? What if it's really bad? I have something to confess. I farted. Yeah. What are you talking about? We're the masterminds of this portion of the adventure. I've got nothing. Yeah, ask him about a giant fiend-beast. I'm sure they know all about it. Yeah. We've got this on lock! Wait. I don't know if he's cool, man. Maybe you should check him. Yennen, you keep your hands where I can see them. Just keep them where I can see them. All right. As you were. Don't worry. Can't be too careful. We're actually hoping you have some information on a fiendish beast named Lucas. Named Victor. Or tell us what you know of goristros. Right, now, we are totally up to date on how to fight these things, but we are also part of a group that's making sure you are at your best in case they come round here. If I were to ask you how to fight one of these things, what would you bring? An interesting answer. Might you be a little less vague for my simple friend here? I expected more, really. I did. I don't even know if it's worth it, at this point. I expected more. You want to protect Whitestone, right? See its people to prosperity? All right, then, maybe you should learn more about hellish fiends! Look what you've done. Well done. You've got to lick your fingers and then wet-- It's all right. We all have room to improve. I suppose we know now where yours lies. You have your orders. Don't make me tell Percy about this. 24. Not a bad idea. You've done lovely work in here, by the way. The rebuilding effort looks great. I'd like to see that passion in the rest of your projects, that's all. Shit. Just curious, do you need any money for these homes? Or anything? Right. Shit. You should know, we've been taking surveys around the town, like, "A, B, C, people most "important in the rebuilding of Whitestone," and role models, and you're always the first name. Isn't that right, Scanlan? I'm just trying to make him feel better. It's you. You're doing good work. (strained) All right. We clearly got the most info out of anybody. You'll be in the chat room; you'll get all the goodies. What? Why wouldn't you make it in front of her, and then it's way less conspicuous. I do! Two pistols, two rifles, really long skinny guy. And I've got a greatsword. I don't want a pistol. How about you take one? No! It's not as intimate as what I do. I need the connection. It'd be like a little GI Joe handgun. Do you want a pistol? I do. I have 185 rounds. So I take out one of the two pistols. Do they look the same? Which one? Are there? I'll give you the super bloody one. Yeah! I toss it to him, and I give him-- (laughs) 15 rounds of ammo. I'm pretty sure if you look into it-- Yeah, that's where the expression comes from "right down the barrel." Yeah, right, yeah. We need to-- (sniffs) you need to clean up the guns. Who has those guns? I have the guns. What you have? Are you joking? For what? Yeah, no, we are. What does it do? It's a cloak of smashing? Deal. All right. I will trade you that for the long barrel thing. In a minute. What about your glasses? Do you? Give me your glasses. Just let me hold them. Show us some faith. How many fingers am I holding up? Was he right? I don't know why you need the glasses. How many fingers am I holding up? Is he right? Very well. You passed. Glasses. And I give him the two rifles. No, this is very important for me out here. I have a position of power, and I'm not about to give it up. What else have you got? Take note, Scanlan this is how you get shit done. I'm listening. Yeah, I have one other pistol, I have 170 rounds for the little bitty guy, and I've got 26 rounds for the (belches) rifles. Do you want the full plate armor and the greatsword, too? (belches) Okay. I give it all over. What's my title? Yes, my humble servants. Are those all official names? Well look, let's keep it on the low-low, right, I don't want too many people getting jealous, so like only in private quarters will you address me by my official title. Yeah, which I look forward to learning. It is, right? Man, I just keep coming up in the world. Coming up, against all the odds. I feel like an Eminem song in the background right now. Eight Mile, bitches. Let's go inside. I've got it! Can I find Vax while he's looking for the gun? I'm sorry, I meant Vex. Yeah, you. Hey, so remember when you showed me your boobies during the fight with Kern? Only out of the peripheral. I wanted to say thank you on a very delayed timeline by giving you this potion of superior healing. (laughter) Yeah, so if they ever get jacked up again, heal them, because I fight better with boobies around. Okay, cool. Deal. Wow. What's that a picture of? Oh. What are the other ones? Are they all together, or is it the one guy? Like, it burns when you pee risk, or it's going to fall off in three months risk? Are we talking about your penis, still? That is terrible. We can't bring them. We'd have to tell them that Raishan's with us. Should I call for a guard? (loudly) Guard! Oh. (stage whisper) Guard! Yeah, no, please don't use my official title. If you would, could you go see if Lady Kima and Lady Allura are around? Yes. Go forth, quickly, with haste. So none at all. Can I ask a quick question? I really like this plan to use the gate thing and go attack Vorugal. I don't even feel like we need Raishan for it. Shouldn't we lure her away to somewhere and then fucking kill her? But we'll be weak and she's on the fringe, because remember, she's barely helping out? We haven't decided. I like tricks, but Ripley got us pretty good, and I don't feel like walking right into another trap one week before another fight. I guess we couldn't get her anywhere with a low ceiling, where her dragon form doesn't have such an advantage? No, I mean a cave or something. What about the little cave in Glintshore? I picture Thordak going, "Raishan, use your treachery and intellect and go kill Vox Machina." All right, so we buck up. We go through with it. I'm down. And Zahra. 5,000 gold. Better make it work, then. Better wait. Did Kima and Allura show up yet? Kima shows up? Kima! It has! Yeah, you little badass. Oh. Yeah. The thinkers are inside the room. Whoa, wait. Do you have a use for it in mind, in particular? How long does it take to copy down the scroll? A couple seconds? What is this voice I'm hearing? No bindings on what comes through? You might get more than you bargained for? Okay. But will its friends come through? Probably is good enough for me. Allura, thank you so much for your time. Please don't let us disturb you any longer. Pretty soon. We only save you for the big fights. Quick, before she comes back. What? It would be the best bag ever, come on. Yeah. Look, when we start attacking Seeker Asum, then we kill Kima. What? She's probably a dragon, too. Look, we don't have to tell her. As soon as we hit Raishan, she'll reveal herself, anyway. That was our agreement, not tell, right? Yeah. She didn't ask. I'm with Percy on that. Plus, Kima is a total bash brother, and if she gets to find out she gets to kill two dragons instead of one, I don't think she's going to be upset. Yeah, did see her, though? She's sweaty. She's working on the outside of houses. You saw how excited she was! It's her choice! If she's our friend and ally, let her choose. Yeah! Yep, what he said. Oh my god, honestly. All right. To a vote. Whether we bring Kima or not. I want her to fight a dragon. All those in favor of Kima not going to fight a dragon, raise your hand. All those in favor of Kima going to fight a dragon, raise your hand. I grab my earring. I'm like, Vax, where are you? Can you hear me? Oh my god! Removing an ally from a fight. Taking one of the guns and going, nah! I want that gun to trust me. There could be ears listening. By the way, that two-week time period we had. How far into that are we? Okay. Just checking. I know, that's what I said. Hear him out. All right, look. The dragon is actually poisoned by a curse. She's very weak. We plan to take advantage of that. Oh. We made a deal. How about you just don't say anything? No, we're good. Yes. We leave tonight. Yep, pretty much. That's it? Dear diary-- Turgid? Vax. Let it be. It was a good swing. Are you hungry at all? I'll find food for you. I go for the kitchen. I'm in the kitchen. If you leave the safety of the mansion, you have the chance of being ambushed at any time by a fucking dragon. All of us? You know, the Dust of Tracelessness you sprinkle behind you. And real quick, we've got to tell Tooma that we're coming? You don't think if we start attacking her dragon, she'll be like, "Oh! It's those fucks from two weeks ago!" It's a horror theme this month, you guys. Friday the 13th. Halloween. Nightmare on Elm Street. Texas Chainsaw Massacre. (laughing) His hand was like, all right. Did you hear the garment of the reaper as he walked past you? (laughter) And we set ourselves up for it.
