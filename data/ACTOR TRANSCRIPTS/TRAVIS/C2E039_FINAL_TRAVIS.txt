There's an explosion on the left side of your face. Then you got punched to the right side of your face. It's kind of great. It looks like you got bloody raw meat on your lower-- Context! The face paint smells like farts. You're going to get sick by the halfway point. It's a gorgeous box. Lots of butts. Holy shit. That's all you need. Uk'otoa. Hey Max, can I get Ashley's iPad? That's 21. Max is bringing it. 16. Caduceus. Yasha's going to pop up! She's there. Does she have half of her speed left? 20 feet. Can she get up onto the platform opposite of Beau? How much further can she go? Can she get to hooded snake, Cobra Kai? Which one is she flanking? This one in between Beau and I? Yeah, with her bonus action she would like to rage. Yeah, with the Magician's Judge, could she make her first of two attacks against that one that she's flanking and could she make them reckless? Oh yeah, so it's already there, right? I ain't scared, and neither is Yasha. She'll use Divine Fury if it hits. That's good. 18. 12 plus five, 17 on the first one. Yes, please. Natural 20. With that barbarian critical! Double the dice. (counting) That's 17 points of damage on the second one. Yes. Not a lot. They were low. Yes. Yasha winks at Beau. Yeah. (growls) I don't know if she was in melee with Yasha. I'll use that sentinel reaction. That's reckless. 18. (counting) 15 points of damage. You look like that two year old that got into the face paint. "How do I look, daddy?" "I'm a ninja turtle!" Those sounds are just awful. Oh shit, he got some movement. Nein. I'll do it. Psychic also? Oh yeah, I'll pop up. Cool, all right. Yeah, cool, cool, cool. Okay, hot second. Yeah, that changed what I was thinking. You know what? I don't want to get in there. Can I just--? Mm, yeah, boy. You know what, where I am, I'm going to fire two blasts of Eldritch Blast at it and I'm going to close-- At Cobra Kai. You know what, with my bonus action-- no, just Eldritch Blast. 16? Ooh, good. Ooh, 15. All right! Oh, it's an eight. 12 points of damage total. Can I move along the wall that way? That'll be fine. Yeah! Metal! Three?! MATT. Two with the rapier. First one hits. Second one still hits. And the dagger hits. All righty. (counting) As soon as you attack, it drops your invisibility, right? First opportunity. Hold Monster? Hold Creature? Starting to feel less terrible about killing them. Do not get close. If you can help it. (scoffs) What's that do? What does that mean? MATT and She's turning around and head-butting the woman. No, I'm just kidding! Yeah. I'll hop off the platform and run towards snake in armor, right? The one you cast on. Yes. That hits. Yes. Reckless attacks. Oh, that definitely hits. That's a 22? 11-- 16 points of damage on the first one. Damn! That's fucking awesome. Yasha goes Don't touch her. And just shoves the sword in, and then slowly lifts up the snake, just bringing it up through its ribcage. Fjord rushes up, summons the blade, and points it at her, summoning a little eldritch energy in his off hand, and says Drop it. That's my turn. Okay. 13. No good? Oh, no! That's Yasha's, that's plus two! This is plus seven! So (counting) 18! Stupid double iPads, fuck! That seems low for charisma. Yeah. Caleb. You understand anything coming out of this thing's mouth? Oh. Caduceus? What's this one thinking? You do that, right? I think that all depends on your cooperation. We're trying to find our way further below. You can either help expedite that or complicate that. Yep. Mine, my stats. Woo! 19. They take it pretty seriously around here. Is Beau feeling okay? That's a big glory hole. Directly above the fountain there's a ceiling, I take it, yes? Oh, shit. 16. Directly above the fountain. Oh yeah, in a vial. You said six inches in diameter? Yeah, that's what I meant. Sorry. She's all fucking sick and fucked up. On the wall where the carvings look like they've carved over something, are there any areas that aren't done as carefully and you can see what was there before it was carved over? Yeah, 11. Uh-huh. Wow! (as Yasha) No. We check the other bodies. That's not bad. I think I made one this campaign. Natural 20. The gold ring have any sort of symbol on it? Symbol of the snake? The ring have anything on it? Okay. Hey, Caleb. I'll flip the gold ring over towards Caleb. I don't know if that does anything, but it was on the lady. How long has it been for-- Oh. Oh! Are people listening or are we by ourselves? Actually, that night after our convo, I had another dream. I found myself under the ocean and then I saw these visions of people that I knew in my life some that had wronged me, some that were very dear to me. I had to force my way through them up this staircase and when I reached the top-- Have you ever heard the word "reward"? It was astounding. Incredible. Hard to believe. It was almost as if the oceans obeyed my commands? How long has it been for you? Yeah, you know, beginner's luck, right? Of course. With my life. Anybody looking at us as I turn around? (pained) Ah, ah! Dead armpit. Maybe she's thirsty. Give her some water from the fountain. Coveted jerky. (laughter) Inclusion. All evidence to the fucking contrary. Her fucking arm's in it. Jester is grabbing naked yuan-ti guy. Milking its face. He got to the top of the temple. That was it, right? Nott? Oh, but maybe it's nurtured by-- Blood and viscous-- You can do better than that. Nott, want to do us a favor to make sure our way is safe? Oh yeah, sorry. Ah-ah! No, Nott! Don't take it. No, Nott. These trees grow in total darkness. Fuck! I was going to have Caleb put the silver string at the entrance so we'd know if somebody came in. How did we get in? We picked the lock. We'll be fine. Yeah. I mean, I'm looking over the edge like this. I should've known--! -- that you had everything under control. Your eyes are like big black saucers. I think he's clearly messed up. Did you have a fresh fruit or-- It's like Rocket Raccoon going through the dimensional rifts. It's 50 by 70. Jamedi, Captain, either of you know anything about these trees, or its fruit that grows in darkness? What's our footing like? Stone, roots, wet? I heard what you said to the trees. Any way to see what runs through these things? Directly below where the fountain was? But why? (deep warped voice) What do you see? Any tracks in the dirt? 13. Not necessarily bipedal. Yeah, you're literally peeling up your skin, cool. (scratching) He bought the ticket. (deep and warped) Caleb, how are you feeling? I pick up Nott by the scruff of her neck and am holding her. Consummate professionals, that's what we are. Zehir? She said we're close. Jester, I don't think anyone is the warden. Oh-- Oh fuck! Yasha runs over-- Yasha runs over to Nott and with the-- Reckless on el vine. Her first strike was 21. Second one was 14. That's nine points of damage on the first one. 12 points of damage on the second one. Oh, it's still there. It didn't cut through it? Oh wow! 20 points of damage. Oh tall Jester! Can I run over to the basket that was tipped over? Can I run over and grab it and pick it up and look at it? Fuck. I'll just fire two blasts of Eldritch Blast at the vine that's holding Nott. Got it. Only you can start a forest fire. Please be more than 18. Fuck. Yeah. Yasha would like to fucking ragé and she will take-- to ragé. Take two strikes using Divine Fury while she's raging of radiant damage towards-- Reckless. That's 20 for the first one. Second one is 23. 19 points with radiant damage on the end of that. 11 points of damage. Thick, green sap? The vine that was holding her was the one that Caleb exploded. Fuck. Ooh! Yeah, they're mean, though. Fjord hasn't gone. Have you taken two turns since-- Nice. Because the basket didn't do anything, I'll summon the falchion and I will run towards the vine. That's not good, though. Oh, good, natural 16. Yeah, the one that has Nott. Yeah. As I'm arcing down and I look out the side, is the eye doing anything? Cool, it's there, good deal. 23. (posh accent) Would you shut up? (laughter) Oh, yeah, I'll take the other one. Yes, please. Oh, that's not going to do it. Nine. Firebolt. I saw you were going-- Like Independence Day. "They're opening up!" (explosion) Damn, 2d10? Ch-ch-ch-ch-check it out. That is my armor class. Okay, okay. The magical elven poison flame hurricane dagger. Yasha will run, clearly disturbed by Fjord being lifted into the air, and will certainly make two reckless attacks. She says (flirtily) "Put him down!" (laughter) Nine, nine. It's nine. Second one's a natural 20. No Divine-- Oh, kickass. Okay. (counting) Yep. So 26. Oh, thanks Jester-- (scared moans) Now am I over your shoulder in, like, the baby burping pose, or sitting on your shoulder? Got to get Nott on --? I think down, but I don't know how to get there. We should move now, right? Sorry, Jester. You all right? Let's go look more closely at those. Trippy! Oh, the one that was-- Sure. Is he wearing manacles? No keyholes, right? We found our way into the room, though. Nott, you think you can fit under that gap? Get going. What do you see? No no, what do you see in the room, Nott? I think she said moving staircase, yeah. Good job, Nott. Why don't you hold Jester's hand and we'll see where these stairs lead? Is Nott immediately visible? Jamedi, where'd your boss go? Indeed. Captain, I feel like we are having all the fun ourselves. Perhaps you and your friend would like to take the lead this next round. Kill you? My goodness, we were just trying to offer you a little bit of fun for this next stage. We had no problem-- Did you eat that fruit yet? Is there anything missing in the room? Hey Phillip, look at me real quick. Phillip! (whistle) Over here. Eyes up. How big are those--? Fuck. Okay. Maybe we should think about getting them some coffee or something? Before we have to go back down? I'll be in the very back. Natural 20! Oh yes. Holy shit! Yasha rolled a natural 20! (cheering) (imitates sounds of drums) The whole chamber is two to three inches? Not me. Yeah. Give it to Beau. It looks like he's asleep or praying, you said? What a good monk. You don't have to whisper. We'll probably get one shot. TALIESIN and Who's got one awesome shot? We do? SAM and What's your awesome shot? I want to say yes. I just don't know if now's the time to be demoing a new thing. You know what? Fluffernutter sounds great. What are you holding? Couple quick thoughts. When we tried to blow up the tree, didn't work so well. Two load-bearing beams in a closed room with no windows, so it's going to hurt us too. Okay, the name is great. I'm just thinking maybe in practical use, not the best idea here. I am the only one doing that. Hold for just a second. Captain. I have been an admirer of your ability to disappear. We could use that talent now if you thought you could get up close and strike without being detected. None of us-- Do you think you have the skill to pull off such a feat? Is that pretty heavy duty? Do you want to be danger close like that? Let's do it. Bolts are just popping off the end of it and onto the floor, just expending shells onto the floor. What is Schmidt? No, no keg. This is fantasy and magic. Fuck the blackpowder keg. I have a strong feeling the keg of blackpowder won't do that much damage. Nope. Don't even know if it has ears. And kill us all. Molly-- Caduceus, fuck, balls! I'm sorry, it happens all the time. If we're keeping our distance-- how many people are seriously considering fluffernutter? Show of hands. Can we put that to bed now? (British accent) Governor? (laughter) Caleb. What is the nastiest thing you have? Can she make your duplicate invisible? Okay, actually, I like that the best. Okay. We're going to send your duplicate to Inflict Wounds, float it up the water, don't disturb anything. Uh-huh. Fluffernutter. Nott, if any of us are in the room, no Fluffernutter, okay? Nope. I feel like I'm talking to Baby Groot in Guardians 2. If we're in the room-- Fluffernutter? No. No fluffernutter. Whatever you're doing, let's do it. Jester and Nott, darkvision, silent as shit. I'll be close to the front, too. I'll get nasty, I have darkvision. I mean, the second that water gets disturbed, it's going to be boy howdy. Wizard in the back. Yasha can get behind Beau. Let's not before we fight. Or meditating. Come on, 5d10. 24? 23, right. I like that sound! We did. Please. You would have singed its scales. 15. Beau, Nott, Fjord-- Beau, Nott, Fjord. 15. Ten to five? Oh, she got an eight also, sorry. Yeah. I will use my 30 feet of speed to run in the direction of Nott. I will cast Hunger of Hadar. 20-foot sphere, 20-foot diameter with the closest lip of it on the side of the well that's closest to us. Here, back. Yeah. I hope so if it won't, I'll move it. Thought there was a big circle. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, cover the well, cover him. Get everybody in, hopefully. Yes. Yeah, it's black. "You open a gateway to the dark. 20-foot radius sphere of blackness and bitter cold." You could hold it in case something comes out of the sphere or the well. Yasha's going to use her bonus action to rage. Double dash into this corner past Beau. I'll hold it, thank you for the reminder. You're right. Yep. Then double dash. Mm-hmm. 2d6? My god, what the fuck is that?! 2d6. Ten points of cold damage. Speed is halved. Mm-hmm. Cool. Merde! Does it end its turn in the sphere as well? 2d6. Nine points of acid damage, if that makes any difference. Doesn't seem so great now. Remember Ten! 15! 11! Lots of points of damage. Was it three attacks from the hydra on Avantika or four? Okay. 2d6 cold damage. 11 points of cold damage. At Yasha? That is her armor class. Okay. 13? Yeah. Yep. Good shit, good stuff. I'm going to (tongue clicking) move a little closer to the column and I'll send two arcs of Eldritch Blast towards the-- Yeah, just closer to Nott. Yes. 17? Okay, so second one. Natural 20. Okay, okay, okay. The first one is 12, second one is nine, 18, 22 points of damage. Like an idiot, I'll cast, with my bonus action, Hexblade's Curse on the hydra, which would have really made that critical way more awesome, but I'm flustered. Yep. Yes! Yasha got fucked up and does not care about Captain Avantika and will move 40 feet towards Nott and Fjord that direction. Great, and will hold a melee attack in case something comes within her range. 2d6 cold. Nine points of cold damage. Needed that. Yeah, more of that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a wasted action. You've got the keg, right? Thank god, there's another checks and balances to that crazy. 22 points of damage to it?! Oh fuck! From the two strikes to it? Her rapier, or--? I'll use the 30 feet of Fjord's movement to go around the pillar, preserve this line of sight with the hydra. I'll unleash two Eldritch Blasts at it. That's an 18 to hit. One. That's terrible. That's 13 points of Eldritch Blast energy. Oh, I'm sorry, wait. Just checking. Plus three, so 16 points, with the additional three. That will be-- Fuck. I should have said it first. That's it, that's my turn. Yeah. That was the plus three to damage. I forgot to do something else. I'll do it next time. What'd you cast? Now she would like to ragé. I don't have to do reckless? Divine thing on the first one. That's only a 14 on the first one? Fuck. 16. It's the first one that hits, right. (counting) 16 points. Yes. Does Sentinel engage there? Does Sentinel come after the attack or before the attack? She's going to do it reckless. Oh, I got you. Shit, I don't remember what it was when I picked it up. Be level! It's a 15. 17 points of-- Where is Avantika and Jamedi in the initiative order? At the very bottom, they were? They should probably go before Beau then, right? Because this is the beginning of a new round. It's staying out of that bubble? With my bonus action, I'll cast Hex at the hydra, dropping the-- The bubble. Yes. Now, I will fire two Eldritch Blasts at the hydra with Hex on top. That's only a 12. That's a natural 20. You said the first one hits? It was a 12. Nine. 18. 18 plus four. 22, thank you. Plus 1d6 for Hex. Four. So 26. No. 30. Total of 30. Thank you. It does. What? Is radiant flame the same? I can if you don't have anything you want to do. Get that fucking bow and that bow is no joke. Those arrows are fucking-- Yes. She will walk up and-- Do I even need to go reckless to get advantage? Amazing. Okay. That's good. That's 25 to hit? (counting) 18 points on the first one. The first hit on every hit gets the third d6. The second hit is a 22. Okay. Two, eight. 16. Yeah! Let's get out of this! Shared survival! You want to reply to that, do you? I'll do the sentry on it. 19 against the hydra-- That was 12 points of damage. Beau's down. It was 12 against the hydra-- I don't have any fire in the bag of holding, either. No attack of opportunity because of sentry, right? Kill her kill her? Okay. Yes, I'll move just so I have a line of sight with the hydra and I'll rip off two Eldritch Blasts in its direction. That is 18 on the first one to hit. The second one is 14. Does not hit. Okay. 1d10 plus four. Nine, plus four is 13, plus-- 16 plus 1d6 for Hex. That's six points. 22 points of Eldritch Blast damage. I do? Are you punching it? It's Yasha? She's going to walk up and swing away. Is there any advantage from flanking anything? 25 to hit on the first one. 15 on the second, does that hit? 20 and there's nothing else. Yeah, 20 points on the first one. Nine points on the second-- I'm sorry, ten. Ten points on the second one. Jester, Caduceus, Caleb are all cowering in the hallway with all the hydra heads coming in. As it rears back to strike, they see the Magician's Judge pierce through the belly of the hydra and cleave through the middle of it. She just goes No problem. Fucking Jamedi. Fuck Matt, jesus. How many heads did we go through? I think we went through-- I'm sure CritRoleStats knows. I think it was around like 14 or 16 or something, I can't remember. That was really good. What's the ballpark damage-ish? Like blank d6? That's right. He said we can still use it if it's not damaged. Fluffernutter.
