(shouting) No, we don't want to! Written through wine and tears. Wait, wait. I'm waiting. I'm waiting to see our foe before I smash. Are you serious?! That's even better! That's fucking great. Don't worry about it. She's been at her books. Nine. I feel like it's not what we think it is. We're right near the entrance, right, no further? The action that I held coming up the stairs. Can I cast Enlarge? What the fuck is that? Shit. Let's do this. Here we go. 27. Why are you all so fucking quiet over there? Fucking gnomes! What happened? Goddamn it. It's personal now. 17. 17. 25 is his-- 26 is? What is it? And I take half of that as well. I'll get the calculator out, because my brain is not working. I remember three meteors last time, not four. Holy Aura fades. Oh my god. Literally, oh my shitty, undead god. It what?! It fucking ignites and explodes the tower. Sunders is not a good word. Oh shit. You cracked the tower! What is the matter with you?! I'm at a loss for what we're looking at right now. That's all right, take your time. Let us know if we can help. You should be okay. Because of your dope-ass Sarenrae wings or whatever. He's immune to prone? You went there, that fast. Best laid plans, huh? 24. I'm up first. Hasted, can I attempt to leap from this island to the one that Vax is currently on? Okay. 28. Can I move to this corner? Can I attach the chain of returning to the Sword of Kas, and throw it up to Vecna? Reckless. Like it matters. Yeah, that's true. 31 to hit. Can't wait. Okay. Calm down. 22. This is undead? Just checking. Ten, 32, 33. Plus enlarge. Plus four, so 37 necrotic damage. Well no, I'm sorry. Not necrotic. Just 37 regular slashing damage. I pull the chain back, catch it with my hasted action, throw it again. Reckless. That's 27. 20. That's a nine so 34 plus one. 35 points of slashing damage. I do? Where is she in relation to him? Right. Got to keep that in mind. Yes. That's a natural 19. That'll do it. I'm frenzied so I have another attack. Okay. Reckless. Last one. Attack was to throw one, but I only get the one because I can't do attack-attack. And then the hasted is another action and then the bonus is to make another attack, but only a single. Does that work? So it's a 30 flat. No? It takes more than an attack action. I have some speed left. Can I run and jump across? I want to land over here. 19. I don't know. Up here man, shit's floating in the fucking air-- Feet up to my strength score? How did that feel? Two legendary actions?! I'm back in the chest of the titan? Does it look familiar? Do I remember? It splits in two behind me-- Do I recognize it? It's not my turn anymore. I completely forgot that happened last time. Of all the tactical things I watched. That's right. It was the death knight. How did we fix that last time? I like how he's surrounded by swirls of Aquafresh. And mourn? That breaks concentration, right? What? Don't look at that. What was it? He has used two legendary actions and a resistance, right? Don't be afraid of rolling ones, man. 11. Did it move? Reroll. It was lower. Since we're being honest. What size would you say Vecna is? Oh, I can't grapple him. (laughter) It's a cantrip? My despair is growing by the second with those words that you just uttered. That's a weird feeling. He has cardiac arrest and dies. Now we're at 20. Pretty sure we're playing this outdoors in Miami right now. I just swallowed my gum. We are getting an education here in the first round. (singing) Talk about fucked! His last two? So he has five. 12d6? Holy shit. People never change, Keyleth. Hey man, at least you hit him. Just chilling. I'm having trouble staying awake. Cyclone. Eight. Sorry. So noble. Oh god, it's on. Here we go. Take a seat, big guy. What about if you're in a strange tunnel? And you can't see anybody. Do you heal? I mean, I hate to win a game all by myself but I don't see a problem. Yeah, they got bounce houses. It's just out. There was a festival going on. It's all good. What's his physicality doing? Vecna-- Oh my god! Matt, let's just call a truce. I think we've learned our lesson, okay? We'll give you Antarctica, okay? It's really cold there. We need a weight for this. Should we take a picture in case it falls? Not a problem, you guys. Sit back. My intelligence modifier? Two. Yeah, I rolled a four. Okay. Pike! Scanlan! (whimpering) Okay, okay, okay. This happened before, right? I should be smart. I'm going to take out the cask of ale and pour a little ale into a tankard and I'm going to use the Amulet of the Drunkard to heal 2d4 plus two. I have two actions. Three. Seven so I heal nine points. And then with my second action, my second hasted action, I'm going to use my second wind to heal 1d10 plus my fighter level. Ten! Plus three is 13. So I heal 13 more points. And that will end. And I will sit (sipping) the rest of the ale and wait for something. Keeping my mind on a small leather pouch in my bag. (laughter) What the fuck happened? Interdimensional chess with the Steve Jobs of D&D. No, this is a new round. No, it's on a page and a marker. It was on a page and a marker. Just let it land flat. It's big. Yeah, it's 26. Oh my god. I'm going to pull my face off. Okay. I'm pretty sure he's missed you twice. You're going to get targeted. He made me vanish in one turn. (laughter) Hey! Oh god. Oh, shit. And he's got to roll for his concentration. He doesn't make it?! He has to roll. He's so high up, it doesn't matter right now. Yeah. He has one more legendary action. One more legendary resistance. The fireball. The meteor. 66 if you saved. Speak for yourself. Grit farm. Do it. Ale solves everything. How high up is Vecna above the deck, would you say? I've seen buffets that are uglier than this. What does that mean? Disadvantage? Did you really?! You got it, you got it. Count your death. I've started to pull out sections of my beard. You're good. Yeah, this is the Ka-- TRAVIS and LAURA and You said 36. If you're under 100, heal yourself. 15. Thank you. 15 plus ten. Oh boy. (laughs) Oh jeez. Oh no. 18. I have resistance to both, so it's 68? From where I was released by the eagle when Scanlan changed back, I'm 20 feet off the deck. How far, if I was hereish-- And he is off the deck how high about now? What would you ballpark it? This is one of those moments. I'm going to hold my action until I am within melee of, or fucking closer to-- My attack action. I'm a barbarian. I have shit for bonus actions. Oh! Oh! Can I take it myself with a bonus action? I know, I know. I don't want to take it, then. I'm holding my attack action until I'm closer. Tell you what, I'll use my movement speed to move closer to being underneath, on the other side of Vax. Are they taking any damage from banging against the cage? Oh, I was going to be like, J'mon give me a ride, and I forgot to say it. He just got pet stored, so-- Oh god, here we go. She was burning and smoking and falling. She took 60 plus points of damage. That is true. And that's his third of this round. One point of damage. Pass the gatorade? Not as much as I wanted to do, but I'm not going to get any closer this round. I'm going to use that action to-- Yeah, but I'm going to take a note from Zahra, and I'm going to, with the Sword of Kas, cast Finger of Death. Is that an attack action? Okay, I'll attach the Chain of Returning, then, and throw the sword. Just out of curiosity, you can't fly or anything, can you? All right. That is a 31. Yes, okay. Oh, nice! Ten, so 26-- 35, 39, 43. 43. It's a bonus action to pull it out, but I don't have one. Got a stuck Vecna. All right! Kim Kardashian's fantasy wedding cake here. It's quite clear we know nothing. He's used all of his legendary actions. And I only need 66. What a fucking boss. Oh, the energy cage? Vecna's energy cage is not concentration, right? The wyverns fall? You will be avenged! That's a lot of people. They should all follow your social media accounts. We have to roll higher than a 22? What do we hit the trammels in with? Our strength? That was attack of opportunity. So we're ten feet below him? Oh fuck, yeah, that's right. I'll use my bonus action to pull the sword back, so it's in my other hand. I mean, I could roll for it-- No, I'd probably hold my attack. If I hold my action, I can hold one thing. So I'll hold until I'm within melee. Yeah. Just get me to him. Don't drop me, just get me there. We've got to pull out all the stops. It's all or nothing. Yes. Were Zahra and Kash petrified, or-- Is that a concentration? But we're like 400 feet up. That's what he was doing. Fail, but I'm going to use my Stone's Endurance to further-- He hit the giant platform that he was raising. Less than 20. Stone's Endurance. Six plus six, 12. So less 12. So 55 points of damage. Fucking Pike, man. No. 224. J'mon's still in the cage? And we can't dispel it, right? I'll dispel it. Around Scanlan? Let's go. Hell, yeah. Why not? We got it, man. We look like healing bonus people to you? Come on, snitch. More of that. I'm going to use that held action to attack twice. No. My first attack is going to be a grapple and with the second attack, I'm going to shank him. 23. And instead of a d10, I'll hit him with a one-handed versatile d8. Reckless. Natural 20. (cheers and laughter) Natural 20. 14 plus 12. Help me. 26. Thank you. 26 plus 14 is-- 58, 64. 68, 76-- There's one more after the 76. 81. One thing. It's a good system, right? Mass Cure Wounds? And then they got frozen. All the women in Exandria disagree. I'm going to use my reaction with Mage Slayer to make a melee weapon attack against him. And he will have disadvantage on his saving throw to maintain his spell, if it is a concentration. And I have advantage on this. What kind of a save? I have advantage because of Mage Slayer. It finally came into effect. I rolled a 26, exactly. On the dot. Right there. I'm going to make that melee attack against him. Reckless, bitch. Oh, so close to a 19. Damn it! LAURA and 38. I rerolled the second one because I reroll ones and twos. Trammel round, right? Do I need to roll to maintain my grapple? I'm going to take the trammel out of the bag of holding. All right, we're going to kick this off. I'll take the trammel out of the bag of holding. I'm going to aim for one of those green openings and fucking try and shove that bitch in his torso. Well, I'm holding onto his rib, right? Can I get his head? I do a strict muscle. Yeah, the thick fucker. We're okay, kids. We're okay. It is a 20, even. That shit takes years off my life, y'all. Just strength. Thank god for the Titanstone Knuckles. Oh shit. That was one. I have another attack. I have my hasted action. Is there any point in hitting him? I'll make another reckless attack against him. That's 28 to hit. (counting) 32. That's 32 points. And I will burn my only action surge to whale away some more. Reckless. This is two more attacks? Damn it! Come on, fucker, hit. 33 to hit. 24, 29, 36. 38 points on the first one. Last reckless. Natural 20. Just one-handed, so it's a d8. Doubled, though. And two damage dice. 57. 61. Not as high as the other one. There were some low ones. Actually, that second to last one was a one. That's an eight, so 68. What, now? That's my turn. 197. Don't be so fucking casual about it! No. I already used my reaction to hit him. You're in! Okay. You're good! How many hit points Vecna got left? Do you want to talk to Vecna about maybe melee hitting me? He's used four this round. Vax. And there it goes, just like that. What level spell was that? He's got a bunch more. Do I have a free hand? Scanlan, how's your athletics? Are you going to try to do this now? Mine is plus eight. AC is 23. Fuck yeah! Dude, that axe is nasty. That has only happened a handful of times on this show. Holy crap. You're going to go with somebody else's die for it? It's okay. The damage pressure? We're not sure if Pike's going to make it. Do the Taylor Swift song. Yeah, you're good. If she double dashes? What's that? Oh shit. You are a steely-eyed motherfucker, man. I'm going to hold my action until I can move. Yeah. I guess I'm straight-up stunned, huh? Can't move or take actions until its next turn. I can't move or take actions until my next turn. Oh, he doesn't have another 9th-level Meteor Strike? Another 12th-level Halley's Comet? Half of 49. Mercer, at the end of my turn, the stun fades? Or at the end of the round? I don't get a reaction or anything? (singing) I'm flying high, defying gravity! Just so you know. Shit. Body-glide. (laughter) Pike, can you undo Polymorph? The fox is by your left hand. There's a fucking treehouse on top of the Fraggle Rock construction. 12. I do have advantage on them because of mage slayer, just in case. Oh, that's actually a 20! I rolled a 19 on the advantage roll. No, she had it out in her hand. She couldn't give it to me. He has disadvantage on his saving throws. And that's with disadvantage, too! Shut your beautiful mouth! God. I'm rubbing my thigh, but there's nothing wrong with it! (laughter) Did Arkhan break? "You can't see me" doesn't work because you're in his face. Yeah, he's got one legendary resistance left. He's been saving it. Yeah, fuck it. Why not, right? I'll use my reaction now that the end of the round is over with to make an attack on him. Oh, I thought it was the very end. I've stopped peeing myself. We've been dealing some pretty good damage. Especially with Ark-- I do have a reaction. No, I do. I have a melee reaction. I'm still going to hit you. Can I take the Sword of Kas and aim for the Hand of Vecna? Can I try and chop the wrist? Why not? Reckless. Okay. Well, I have advantage normally, reckless, so just a straight roll. 32? 33. Hand stay on him? Okay. Cool. That's just my reaction. Yeah, thought I'd maybe Luke Skywalker his hand. With all the rage I've ever had, I will reckless attack. Grab the trammel from Pike and aim it right in his stupid chest. Yeah, enough. Inspiration because fuck it, why not? Yep. That's 33. Oh, right. 33. 33 was the total. Cool. I'm going to keep hitting him. I have my hasted attack. Oh, that's right. Sorry. Yeah. My bonus action is a straight-up reckless. 17. That's a million. 35 is to hit. Eight, 24, 32, 42. Enlarge. 44. Literally, it's all we got. What? It's not too late. Retcon that shit. You haven't rolled a thing. No. He just told us. I don't think the hand comes off unless the person goes. You're grappling him too, right? Does Vecna have to speak to cast Banishment? I'll do that right now. I'll use my reaction against mage slayer, and I'm going to punch him in the face. Just punch. Oh Jesus. Just trying to break concentration, so I'm going to (punch). Reckless. 25 to hit. 1d4. Three plus eight. 11. He's got to roll at disadvantage. All right. I'll hit him with the sword of Kas. Reckless. That's a critical. That was a 19. I'm not used to hitting on those. Oh shit. I already rolled high. Oh, fuck me. Oh shit. 28. 36. That's a one, but I've got to re-roll it. 42. Yeah. 58. On saving throws? If I damage you-- When you damage a creature that's-- yep. I will forego the rest of my turn. Oh my god. There's always a one out there. What is it? I take out the immovable rod out of the bag of holding, and I put the heel of my hand against the trammel as it starts to push, just to help it. I make sure Pike's with me over here. Yeah. I hold hands with Pike. Sick. I rolled a 22. Holy cow. "Ooh, but I dispelled it. That's why I moved closer." MVP'ed it. After all this time, you finally saved them. That punch was super close. Yeah, the gnarliest map of all time. We pick this up next week. Johnson, we love you.
