Happy birthday, buddy. Big deal. Take all your clothes off and then figure it out. Yeah. She Hunter's Marks that shit. We weren't expecting that. We are legion. (sings) Yeah. Oh snap! Damn. Probably should have fucking researched that creature. I never do that. I have a question. What did you roll on your beard check? That's true! A sexy amount of facial hair, you beast! Be glad there's a table between you and I. (all laugh) I gotta shave tonight. I didn't level up! What a dick. I did, but I didn't. How many do I add? What? Me too. 16. The dark cloud aids his rolls. Vengeance! (whispers) Are we in a valley? Or are we-- Okay. It's electrifying! I have to put my head in its mouth? Okay. 19. Which one dead or unconscious? Don't throw around the "D" word, unless it's the "D" word time. She would like to rage. I do need a good back tickle. Yeah. (laughs) It's not at me for once. That's good. 22. (posh accent) Would that be considered piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage? (posh accent) Oh fucking shit. (all laugh) Ow! (laughs) Getting ass-lit up with the Hail of Thorns, I go into a rage. I go into a Frenzied Rage! And I would like to attack three times with my flaming warhammer. That is 24. 21? Eee! 26. Nice. Those were really good rolls. Okay. First one is 11. 13? First one. 14 for the second one. Yes. 17 and 18, 19, 20, 21 plus the fire damage. Including fire damage. I'm going to move. Can I move towards you a little bit? Yes, staying next to him, but just out of the way of other projectiles that might be coming up my butthole. You should pick a blood-colored one. (laughs) That was the best. Dick. Guilted it for an imaginary bear. We'll find out. Yeah, Minxie! (all cheer) They in control. Bobby Brown. Jesus. Do what you're going to do. That's amazing. Is that a ten? That's a ten? Amazing. Thank you, Scanlan. Misfire? Fuck. It happens to all guys sometimes. (all laugh) Stop rolling, Jesus. Oh shit. That hits. Halved. Halved. Okay. You piece of shit. Not cool. Like me. I would like to try and break the grapple. 20. Natural 20. (all cheer) I bite its tail. Son of a bitch! Ahhh! I'm so pissed that I broke free, that I would like to use Intimidating Presence on this creature. Is it? Yeah. (laughs) -- for a later time. I hit the shit out of it. (all laugh) Okay, 21. All right, that's 22. 22! Sorry, 22 hits? Oh, I get one more. Also 22. Oh, got you. Nine, ten, 11, 12. 15. With fire damage! Bitch. You grabbed me. You ask first. Yeah. (laughs) I love Minxie. Hell yeah! It was a good one. Nice, Minxie! So bad. Is the creature blinded from the pokey-poke? Hey, I didn't ask for science. Jesus. (all laugh) (laughs) Just a little pokey. I got my finger on the trigger, I got my finger on the trigger, gun! Nice. But not as rough as Stitch over there, huh? Don't think too hard. Jesus, I don't think we've ever seen anything this hard. You know the silence before the storm? He hasn't said anything. Here comes the boom? I don't need it. 19. Can I use my Stone's Endurance? Okay. (yells) I try and match the Godzilla roar, it's not really as good, and I swing three times with my fire hammer. That's a 18. 21. And 19. That anus! That's 13. 23, and 22. I'd like to reach up with my firebrand warhammer. And I would like to smash it on top of its skull, and when it hits the ground, I'd just like to keep turning it into jelly and paste and sweet jams that I can bottle it up and sell later! Lullaby?! What happened? Oh, look, we made jelly. Can I roll a hit dice to recover some-- Oh. Was it in a cave? Be here. Oh snap! I'll take it. Athletics. Oh yeah, c'mon. No, I can't. You're going to use one of your Lucks? I laugh heartily. That Grog, what a dick. There's not even like a tooth. Like one broken tooth? A piece? When Grog goes to work. LIAM Boom. Kill the behir, take its glands, money. With what, the gland? Hello? I don't speak your language. I'm rolling one more hit dice. That's right. Okay. Definitely should still leave. He is. That was so much better than shopping. (all laugh) Yeah, he's got a lot. Where'd Tiberius go? That's fine. We start walking. Jauntily stealth ahead. Like a beagle. Is that your scanning face? I thought you did a different technique last time. Listen, if we do run across a dragon, remember we have the dragon slayer longsword, which is a plus one to attack and damage rolls, and if you hit a dragon or a dragon creature, it gets an extra 3d6 of damage. Sorry, I blacked out for a little bit. (all laugh) What do you have to do to attunement? Caressing it? That's more than I usually do. Just in case you need a sword. I missed it. It must be good, though. Can we keep walking? West side's on the shore side, right? Ocean's there? (laughs) He winked at me! It's like being blessed. Chasms? That might have sentries. I could do it with you, if you want. He's not going to let me do it. An intelligence check, because I'm an idiot. (laughs) I did something smart! (all laugh) Oh, and I drank some of that nasty dank in the fight with the Hammer, round two. Yeah, that's bad. Maybe go up on the other side of the chasm opposite of it? Pass Without a Trace. And climb along the opposite side. I have dust of tracelessness. What about one of those things that always works on me-- -- a diversion? That was perfect timing! His ways are mysterious, my love. Couldn't hurt. You know, we could try to work our way up the opposite side of the chasm. Yeah, it can't move with us. Could you make it fire? We're also on a chasm, so if it gets wet and slippery and muddy we might all go down. I have mine too, so I'll put that on as well. Attached to a rope and a grappling hook that's in my hand. Fuck yeah! Nipple tits. 26. 26. No, no, up here. No. (all laugh) I told her not to say it, why'd you say it? 15. We gotta go in now. Vampire giants. How awesome would that be? Can we please go see? Can someone please-- Vax!? Careful. Oh no no no no! Don't roll! Don't roll! (all shout) Do it. (laughs) You are the night. What did you get? Really? Can giants become vampires? I want to look for any weapons that are lying about. Me, investigate? That's funny. Eight. I find dirt. Wow. MATT You do notice that some of the blood is dragged through, like something was dragged out of the puddle. But not for a long distance. Whatever was there was cleaned off at some point, or lifted up and carried out from whatever was originally pulled through those puddles of blood. You also do notice that in the pile of furs and refuse and there are bones of things that were left there to rot in the corner. You find roughly 120 gold pieces. Is it evil? Can I walk out the front door? Can I walk out the front door and keep post on the porch? And I want to look in the direction we want to be walking. She's attuning. Do we see anything outside on the porch? Stealth. I might use your inspiration on this. I am in the mountains. I don't have advantage on-- So can I add an inspiration on this? That's a one. (loudly) That's what I said, birds! (loudly) Yeah, I spy birds, they're flying everywhere. (yells) Go away! I run back inside. Do it! Do they fall to the porch? I run out there and I grab it. I rip its head off with my teeth. (all laugh) Yeah, shut up! Dust of tracelessness. Why? They were just birds. And we're at the southern part of that? That's a detailed map, man. They sell those stock, right? Riveting. We could send one in. Just to see if the town is normal or not. We should send one by air and one by land. Like up in the trees? We're gonna climb some trees. Yeah, get on the ground, not just above. And as they're going out, we get in the trees. Do we, the four of us, all go up in the trees? Plus ten to stealth? 14. Stealth. I've been doing the dust of tracelessness. We'll see. I'll take it. What?! Really? The golden snitch wins again. Six? Smart. (snores) (yells) I fall out of the tree. Because he's dead. Nice bonnet. I like it. Nope, this is a trust exercise. You don't like the trust exercise? No, I'm good, thank you. That could help. Can we at least try cutting down the bodies and running, and seeing what happens? I heard you're supposed to pee on a lemon tree, so. Can I make a nature check to see if that's true? 19! That's 17. Operation tree rescue. I have an idea. Should we wait until the sun comes up, create a distraction, so all the undead giants come looking, and then we have someone go cut the bodies off the tree, and-- -- let Keyleth give it a little love. I don't know. It's an experiment, all right? They can see through that. Oh, shit. This is like phone a friend? Who knows? You have a plan? Tell us your plan. Shh! Let him finish the plan! Okay, where do we start? (pained groan) Fucking gravity. This is, like, sunup, right? Let's go find an abandoned building and set up. This is what happens. Holy crap. Step one of this. Do we take the stealthy one or the invisible one? First part is getting an abandoned building. Abandoned building, part one. So who goes and finds the abandoned building? We need a forward operating base, so who wants to be stealthy or invisible and find an empty building? Does it require attunement? We have dried food rations. We've got dried food rations. He has a plan. Come on. Drop your pants and get with the plan. It's like 12% of a plan. That was an eight. Beard check. Amazing. Is it like that Vidal Sassoon commercial? Whip it. You can forget it. I won't go in. Look like commoners? Shit, I'm a goliath. Are we all going together? Are we not sending one person in to go find an empty building? Leave the bear. Or do you want him to be a donkey, something we can move. Milk cows are slow. Just like her owner. I wanted to be a model. Oh shit. Are we checking buildings while we're walking through? Was the first number gonna be a 40? We casually begin-- Interesting. It's north. Yeah. We continue on. Don't pay too much attention to it. Find a place to post up. That's a large radius, right? Do it from inside a house. I know. Five. What? Do you want to get closer and look? Are you sure-- They're probably watching the tree. I don't think they're here. I don't think they're here. No, remember they have to, like, be where the soil they came from is? I don't think they're here. Okay. The one's painted all red-- We're all there. No, it was because of Emon. Let's stick with the plan. Yeah, 150 feet from the tree. Preferably three bedroom, three bath. No, no, no, no, no, not yet. Let's post up first. Yeah, we're all going in. Come inside. Don't bring that-- don't mess with that thing. Once we do it, it's like ringing a dinner bell. Yeah, we'll take it. I am, too, I'm staying up in the tavern. You want the top floor, I'll take the bottom floor. Holy shit. No! Go for it! Okay. Vax and I are guarding the tavern, so if anything comes-- That was a delicious feast. Duck down low!
