She doesn't know this. Wyrmwood! Oh, that's mine! Yep. No, you can keep that shit. (laughter) They still be helping kids read and write and play D&D. It's amazing. Let's get it on. Foreshadowing! He's on the back of the bear, right? We take him inside. No, no, no, no. Come on. Nope. All right, I'll move. I'll move. Sure. The fuck you will. Yeah. I got it! I walk over and I slap the shit out of him. Hello, gorgeous. Yes! Who's talking crazy? You never do. Good question. That's not a problem. Is there somewhere where you would like to go after you die? Or are you going to wake up right after you die? He might come back as like a dog. Yeah, or like a penguin, so he's like a bird that can't fly and he can only swim. And I start stretching. The taint intimidation. Like balsamic vinaigrette. Well, maybe we should have Pike cleanse his blood so he won't come back after he dies. Do it! Do it! You're looking in the wrong direction. We could just let you go to him. Hold on. Hold on. And I stick my fingers into his mouth and I grab his tongue and pull it down to-- Nobody else has any other questions? I take out Craven Edge, and I step back, and with a huge swing aim right under his trin. I've got goose pimples. Was that good for you guys or what? Yeah, but he was evil. Not happy time? Can I turn to the side and go, how was that? I don't see you anywhere? (laughter) He's shy. We did do it pretty expediently. 5,000? Really? It's a lot. Why would you even say that? Why would you even put that out there? Wasn't there something we were going to do, though? We weren't really drinking. We were pretend drinking. We could be real drinking. That, or we just hate doors. Let's go get a drink! Or do we want to branch out? Yeah. Taste some new ale! You are a smart one. I feel like my intelligence went down one. You can't really do this wrong. That's us. Yeah, we getting in a fight? Drink more. Not a problem. Stand up, you lot! It's clear. (laughs) (laughs) That's true. When do we tell her that's a Shirley Temple? (laughter) So hammered off this cherry juice, you guys. (laughs) Yes. You really suck. I don't know if it's because you're so tiny-- Yeah, but you put darts in two people's arms, I mean, are you really that-- That's true. He squealed out like a little girl, too. You know what's really cool to do at the end of the night actually that will make you be there for the sun coming up, is if you do four shots of firewater in a row. Yeah. It's a thing. It reinvigorates you, but you got to do them back to back to back to back. Listen, listen. Only because I'm identifying with your need for revelry, why don't you and I go do four shots back to back to back to back? Actually, you stay here. I'll bring it to the table. And I go and get the shots. Nine shots. Ten shots. Oh, two shots? That's ten shots. Yeah, quad. What? She wants to see the sunrise. She'll totally be up for it. Yeah. It's amazing. I come back with ten shots. And two for Pike, so 11 shots. I don't want it, anyway. 14. Salsa? Little mild salsa? No, she's got to stay! We should pick her up and carry her around the bar. (laughs) Come on, Keyleth! Yeah, I'll get her water. I'll get her a little jug of the firewater. It'll wash out her mouth. The weak stuff. Yeah. I think they call it regret? Goldschlager. Jaeger. Lemon citron vodka. Does Keyleth lose the benefits of the Heroes' Feast since she retched it all over the ground? We don't know either way. Down in the dungeon, there was the demon. Yeah, he was a fucking dragon. Well, hold on. He made a deal with you. If he doesn't do it, we'll find somebody that will. He's a man of his word, and we'll back it up. You don't have to do it. Excellent point. And remember, there were dangerous things in that house. We can make sure that it's safe now, protecting the, you know-- God forbid. She said fine! I heard her. She said fine. We think so. I'll stay in the dungeon. They can stay in my room. What, are you really cock-blocking right now? Are you cock-blocking in the keep? Yeah! Can't wreck that game! (laughter) Why don't you invite the little pickpocket to sleep with you? So you can keep an eye on him. So he doesn't steal stuff. Where are you going, perv? Let's turn in! You're not there, Drunky. (whispering) Holy shit-- No shit, it won't matter. Balls. We don't know that yet. So paranoid. How was last night, huh? Pretty wild? Thank god the walls are made of stone! You? Struck out? Maybe I should have a go at her, then. Wait, wait, wait. Are you in love? Holy shit. Water. Fire water. What? You were very passionate. You were like, "I need fire water," I said, "okay." So you remember when we went to General Krieg's house? Yeah, it's all good. We're making sure the city is safe from the house. It's empty. We're going to make sure it stays empty and safe. Yeah. Well, somebody said that they were afraid that bad things were coming out of it. Yeah, let's go. Okay. And we leave. Yes! Who else is coming? No, we should stay, we shouldn't go to the house-- Yeah, let's fucking go! We can remember how to get back to that house, right? Five. I like it. Should we tell them when we go to the bathroom, too? Yeah. Yeah, we'll totally wait here while you go tell the guards that we want to go inspect something. Oh, fuck that. I walk up to the door and knock really loud. I thought we were around the back. I'll hop over that. 15. Hmm. You might want to tell the guard I'm walking on the yard. Let them know I'm going. And I go off towards the house. It bobbles on the cobblestones. That's a great idea. Brilliant. Boom, boom, boom. There's no answer at the door! I reach down and high-five Pike. I stick my head in the door and I go hello? Is anyone home? I lean back and I go there's nobody answering from inside. Vex, you might want to go tell the guard no one's inside. It smells like roses inside. Wow, those sucked both times. I know, it smells pretty good in here. What? So it's a big old house. Can we like split up and get it over with? Anybody else? All right, well, you guys go upstairs and we'll clear out this floor before we go anywhere else and we'll wait for you to come back down. Yeah, you were like a dick in a box. Oh, 11. Are there any, like, sculptures? Or pieces of art downstairs? Or desks? Like the Denver airport? The funhouse. Should we check the fucking carpet? Does Pike get a cloak? I go over to the dominoes. If it's evil? You think it's bad? Love, Macna. All right, are the dominoes just like on a table? I grab the table and I shake it. I think it's evil. I reach down, I pick up one of the ivory die. I believe it tastes like a domino. Are you sure? 19. I think we just run ahead. Can I do that one too? I can survival stuff pretty well. That'll be way worse. 11. There was a bunch of gold. Can't we send like a probe, can't you make a little person? A little fake little person? He can't take a magic ride? 18. Oh mine is-- Oh, 18. Umber hulks? Did you do that? That's cold-blooded. What, I have it. I go over and put it under the gold. I open up the Bag of Holding. There's gold! We're not yet.
