That was amazing. He comes in character! (all laugh) I love you. I love you! (laughing) I don't want to live. Shit. Fuck yes. Would you like to go? Is the boat beached on the shore yet? Okay, good. I would like to bust out at a full dead sprint after Percy. "There's no blood being had without me!" Screaming. That would be bad. (teasing) There's "no" really? Embrace him. Embrace him! Tell me it's not over. I live for one thing. "Hold on, let me check." I take it and I shake it really hard. I think I know what I'm doing. All right, here. You can check it. Glad I shook it. Give it over here. A Greatsword of Frenzy? Plus, nobody is hurt. Well, I'm not hurt. The second whisper. 21. And the shark. Plus Ash's was natural 20. 21. Let's see what happens! I would like to rage... and run! (all laugh) Rage running! (frantic noises) Look at that honor code! (screaming in panic) Whack! Boom! Oh my god. (laughing) Sorry. Shit. Your powers are worthless. I have to applaud. Well, we'll find out real quick. We're in the boat. Like I said. How close is Manta Ray? I was going to do something else. I don't think the chain's long enough. 50 feet long? Is the Chain of Returning long enough to get to him? (laughing) I'm going to hold off. I would like to hold off, and maybe he'll come closer, since I seem to be an intimate sort of fellow. 13. Can I take that turn now? Now, since I shook it off, I'm like, "That's lovely," and I would like to try, for the first time, Intimidating Presence. On a creature within 30 feet. (yells) (all laugh) 13. Wisdom saving throw. That's right, bitch! He's frightened until the end of the next turn. Knock it into the water. Let the shark have at it. Bigby's Hand? I have one thing I do. Yes! Yes! The middle finger. Kill Bill-style, right? Oh, we can make wind. Good, we'll do that. We made our way to the beach. On the bottom of the-- I would like to perceive if Lady Kima has been giving me any second looks after I intimidated old Flappy Wings. Ten, plus... probably nothing. Yeah, nothing. Ten. We have firewood bundles and stuff. Want me to go in? We have torches. I pull one of the three torches we have and, "Tiberius, will you?" I give it a nice long throw. We don't need to go in there. Wall it up! Yeah, do I see any shapes and colors and sparkly things? Between you and Tiberius, with the columns and stuff? I don't need to rest, so I can just stand guard. Go for it. I think it's the funniest thing I've ever seen. (all laugh) I automatically don't like it. Please say no. She's in the floor! And she's in a boat! It's magic. (giggles) Will you teach me that sometime? I stop laughing. Vials? Okay, who needs to rest? Show of hands, who needs rest? We've got a bomb. Scanlan, toss it. Yeah, you wait and see what happens. Excellent. I don't need to rest. I'll stand guard. Do that, you two. Yeah, just block it off. I start kicking sand and gravel into the cave. Me, too. Still kicking sand in. Hundreds? In the temple. I go over to the water and scoop some and pour it over my head. (all laugh) Did it work? Presents for your friends! That's a good gift. I've got to pee! Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. (weapon crack) Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for... lady favors. Also ale! Gifts. Gifts for your friends and family. Your pets. While they've been sleeping, I took my axe-- Oh, no? I thought we rested. I start digging a ditch with my axe in the sand. Don't worry about it. To inspire Keyleth with her scrying spell, I hop in the ditch I've been digging and start going, "Look, I can do it too! (laughs)" And I start paddling in the ditch. Is that inspiration? Are we hitting each other now? Could you tell me what a beholder is first? Because I don't know. With finger eyes? Worst possible scenario imaginable. Yeah he's got lots of teeth. Let's brush 'em. Not the beholder? Among other things, it seems like. He's super strong. It is glass on the top, so we could try to Sunlight the head? Up. How would we free the prisoners, first of all? Eff you, brass cross! Yeah, it took months. We're also forgetting that the second that he sees us or we get close enough, he could control all of our minds. That sounds awesome. Let's go there. Yeah, I like that. Let's go take over a little shanty-town. It'll be a little victory. We'll take over the shanty-town. No. I don't, either. Yeah, baby steps. I've got a big axe. I'll paddle the boat towards the island. I've been practicing in the sand to impress Keyleth. Working on the elevator. I haven't figured it out yet, because I don't know what that is. So who's in the boat with me? Percy, Keyleth. Pike and Trinket. So we start paddling in the boat. Yeah, we'll take Kima. (singing) Love Boat. Watch your mouth. That's squid for no. But you're on the boat. Yeah, we're already paddling. The boat's going too. We're fucking fast. Oh yeah, about to smash you. It's a 22. Where's my stealth? 19. So 29. I immediately hop out, pull the boat up just to beach the boat. Are there any of those crazy trees you mentioned before? Dr. Seuss trees. Not cool. Like what? Other creatures? Other creatures? Don't skimp on the details, it's only our lives. I take the cask of ale out of the Bag of Holding and pour him a little glass of ale, and I'm like-- It sounds a little scratchy. Would you care for some ale? Why? I will not forget that. I rolled 15. Holy shit. We're getting better! Plus my inspiration from paddling. (laughs) Do I see him? Can I do a simple recognize check? Come on! Really? But wait, maybe if we sell out the shirts we can go another half-hour or something. There's 20 shirts left? That's rad. Oh, was that a birthday huzzah? TRAVIS AND It's amazing. I may or may not... have sung that at home. What's his name? Who's this? I've got an axe. I'll show you. Gazlowe? Yeah, he's really stupid. Yeah, I'm Gazlowe. He's the little goblin that could, you know. He's got no plans later. That could be really cool. For a thousand bucks? Thanks, Tristan. You can dance. I feel like this is trying to read the Matrix, it goes so fast. "I want that jacket." Six-four. Something about Tiberius's brother. How did the kid die, Marisha? Sam, what's it like being the sexiest member of the group? Yep. Matt, how do you deal with writer's block, and when can we expect Trinket plushies? How did the group come up with Vox Machina? Yeah, me, too. SHITs forever. Royalty. I saw, what level is everyone, and what is your alignment? Alignments, starting with Liam. Chaotic good. Tiberius? Your alignment. What's your alignment? (laughs) Percy? I'm chaotic neutral. Sam? "Is that what I am?" That was amazing, actually. That had a lot of conviction behind it. "Liam, scoot in. We can't see you." Virgin sacrifice. Keyleth, do you have a holy symbol? Do you have a holy symbol? Are any of you guys going to GenCon? That's a good one! Did any of you grow up shy? Tiberius, would you say, "I encourage violence"? This. Liam's birthday party. "Age rages?" I'm having a motherfucking aneurysm. Oh, back in Dallas. Like, right out of high school, we were in the same talent agency. With the silent extra talk. [no audio] We thought we were superstars. "This is the greatest job ever". She totally fell for me. (laughing) Yeah, no joke. Do you ever want to be a player and not a DM? "Zac, what was the most recent picture you shared with the community?" Somebody is asking to see it. Or asking me to ask you to see it. Yeah, like, 40 years. "Pike, does Scanlan have a shot?" How did you and Trinket become friends? Did you eat the cub? Oh, the cub is Trinket. There we go, watch this thing light up. Stephen Colbert. There's a Laura emote! If Grog comes across his uncle, yes, he would definitely want to kill him. Bad relationship. With his son, yeah. My cousin. Let him go? Yeah, well. My childhood affection was the only thing that let him live. But if we see him again, maybe a different outcome. Why are you asking the DM? Don't put ideas in his head. In this campaign. You don't know what happened when I went through the portal! A barbarian never kisses and tells. We did summon a pony and chop its head off. And smeared its gore all over us. We had a dried poo chunk. Disgraceful or amazing? Minutes after. That was pretty bad. He needed to be motivated! He was a little clumsy, but he got through, didn't he? Yeah? And then I slept on the couch for two nights. (all laugh) Tiefling? What's a tiefling? I think this might have been covered, but how did the campaign start? Is Trinket's intelligence higher than Grog's? No. Okay? It's not. Yeah, suck it. Best and worst? (laughs) Does your full name fit into a tweet? Don't let them have it. (laughs) Did you ever consider doing a longer episode? What's that? MATT, SAM, AND Why do you want us to die? What a shitty question. He lunged and-- tell them. Scanlan's never killed anything. (laughs) When are you guys going to do a drunk episode? You looked excited. So why did Scanlan take a dump on that guest room bed? (laughing) Has the worst day. There's a video of it. You went under the table. I pick Mercer. Nobody else can take it. You're many characters. Is it? Oh, Keyleth. Fucking Burt Reynolds. Burt Reynolds, the customs officer. We haven't been to Gilmore's? They were pine cones. You had a good initiative. Yeah, you are fickle on your dice, though. Come on. We intimidated this-- I love it. Nothing? Zero? Nada? Oh, yeah, we've got to go on Honesty Hour now. Give them the whole shebang. Ride the feels. We got the last six guards that are totally awesome. Baratheon. Yeah, give us something. You're in love with the Dread Pirate Roberts? Were you guys ever playing during the D&D scare of the '80s? Whatever that means. No, we're all much younger. Important how sexy is Grog? As sexy as you want him to be. Can we have a Kima wedding? I'm working on her. Oh. Yeah. You and a wiener onscreen. (laughs) Do you design specific things for an hourglass? Are there particular scenarios that require it? Somebody asked how I became a goliath because it's not an official race in the book. Is it not an official race? Now it is. I think I asked Matt what the bigger creatures were in the world and he said orcs and other things and he also said there were goliaths that were half and half and I was like "can I be that?" He was like, "sure." That was a thing I asked Marisha once, during our first game, was, "Wait, I can do whatever I want?" "Kind of." You can try! How do you handle Percy crafting things? No, we thought maybe one or two things. And then alcohol made its way in. Somebody asked, "if you accept fan art, "would you also accept someone making fight music for the game?" No. Personalities are fucking great. People asked if this will be on Video On Demand or if people miss it, how do they see it? Wow.
