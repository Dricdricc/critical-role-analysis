I mean, he's a whole new echelon. It's a whole new-- Incredible! Yeah! Woo! Yep. 'Cuz you suck. I have to, like, show up an hour early and learn how to play, or we're going to get. We're going to get killed a lot. We've got to work on our death sounds. (belches) No. No. You... are the one falling, in the opposite direction of up. It's a quad lay-up. (Walken voice) Quad. Lay-up. Critical Role It's About Scientology-- -- and a Daisy Chain of Assholes. April 1st! WonderCON! Anaheim. It's really happening. And it's going to be a big, big, rowdy room. So if you're like, "Aw, I don't want to go, there's not going to be any seats." There gon' be seats. Bring it, if you can. I can say that. He's not listening to this right now. Oh, snap! DDP! I think he's rude. And he smells funny. Siggle Boost? Do I? So great. It's a lot. Yep. (sniffing) Allergies. (groans) You don't need that-- he can have that many. You have too many. We're good. Well done. My palms are really wet. I reach into my Bag of Holding, and I pull out a small drawing of the letter "G". This. This is what I have learn-- That's not it. That's not what I wanted. And I take out the Dwarven Thrower and I jump into the sandpit. Oh, shit. (blows raspberry) I get advantage on my (mumbles) That's shit. That-- that's one worse. Hey! You can go away. Mm-hm. Awesome. What a dick move! What a dick move! Right. (clears throat) I, uh. I bow. And say... Kord's strength be with you. And I smash the Titanstone Knuckles together. I would like to move backwards three squares. That's my turn. Fucking knew it! What is-- It's a test already! I hate the SATs! I hate Scantrons, I hate number two pencils, I hate all of it! (all laugh) MM-hm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I start in that same distance from him, the same radial distance, I start walking to my right. My full speed. That's my turn. All right. Okay. I would like to rage. And I do so by taking the...dwarven thrower and smashing it against my chest. And then I chuck it at him. (whispers) I knew it. (louder) I mean, I didn't know it. Which is a minus two, right? That's a six. Any reason why? Not that I'd know. Cool. Do I have another attack? I shake off the random numb arm, and I toss it over to the other hand like, "C'mon, Betsy!" And I throw it with that hand. (all laugh) I don't know D&D enough to know what the fuck's happening right now. Ooh! 16? I have a modifier of zero. Minus two. I rolled an 18. He's not even here. This is a dream. 16. All right. All I have is my bonus action. Oh I did, yeah. I don't have a bonus action. That's my turn. No, I don't. God dang it! I try and hit him with it with both hands. Yeah, both hands. Six! This is so stupid! Okay, I keep the hammer in one hand but I just try and punch him with the Titanstone Knuckles out of frustration. What? No weapon in my hand? Nine! I'm going to stay within his attack range, but I'm going to 180 around him. And I'll stay there. No he doesn't. Come on. Come on. Oh, this is a nightmare. I just want to hit him! (all laugh) No! That's a zero. (all laugh) (surprised grunt) I look so pathetic right now. Okay. (sighs) Second attack. I just want to touch him with my finger. Just, like, a boop. He's real?! He's there?! Thought you might be a dragon. Wisdom saving throw? Oh! I touched him! (heavy breathing) That's my turn. Wait, I haven't learned the lesson yet. I'm still-- Oh no. (squeaky voice) Mmm, yep. (squeaky voice) Yep. Mmhmm. Seven? Eight? Yeah. Oh shit, that's 20 points of damage. Cool. Uh, yeah. Sweet, sweet anus. What do monks do? Can I, like, use my magic powers? And I want to keep my eyes closed, and I'm gonna swing around behind me, knowing that I just got kicked in the back there. Oh! No wisdom saving throw? With disadvantage? Uh, 23. (mumbling) Okay, with a ten. I should've done it reckless. No, I don't want him rolling reckless, holy shit! God, I'll die in a second. That's 18 points of damage. So it goes (low hitting sound). I close my eyes again. I swing around the other way, and I try to connect. That's not bad. 14 and 20, uh... 29. Yes, okay. Damn, same thing, so 18 points of damage. Stink eye? Fuck. Pink eye? Be nice. I'm a student here. That hits, yeah, it's my AC. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Three ki?! (strained) I would. Yeah, I've totally forgotten that, I'm just totally stunned at this point. That's good, that's 32. (sing-songy noises) That's a ten. So 20, 25. LAURA and And I feel all shake-weighty at the moment, right? Can I take a step towards him? Does anything happen? Do I shit my pants? Can I take the other four steps of the five step exploding heart point technique thing? Cool. Just explosive shat. I'd be, like, kill me now. Kill me now, take it away. Can I close the rest of the distance to him? I want to try the bear hug again. I want to grapple him. So I can touch him now. The wisdom saving throw was something in the beginning. There's frustrated grunts happening. Okay. 24. Plus 16 plus eight. Damn. My athletics versus his? Judo? Cool, that was nice. Do I have a second attack? Two-handed great weapon master, please. That's not going to hit. 24. Oh, it does? Oh, 23, that's right. Thank you, god. No it doesn't, 24 minus five. That ends my-- Nope. That ends my turn. Yep. Unarmed attack? Oh, that hits. Okay. Yeah, that hits. Hits, also. Nine? Damn, Gina. 21. What was the effect? God damn it. I'll shit my pants before this fight is over with. On the button? It's the brown note. My turn. I am so tired of this slippery shit. I go into a frenzied rage! Yeah, thank you. I would like to Great Weapon Master try to hit him with the Dwarven Thrower. Not reckless. No. (crying) I don't know what the lesson is. 32 minus five is 37. 27! Yeah. 32 minus five is 37! 35. I was encouraged until he got creepy with the talking. All right, I hit him again! That's gonna hit. That's a 31 minus five is 26. 22... 32. Last one. Reckless. What's life without a little spice? 18, not quite. 34 minus--29. Yeah. Close to what I wanted. This is 33. Is he bruised? Is there a slap mark? I mean, is there any blood? Anything to tell me that I might be doing a good job? Good! Yeah. (squeaks) Hits. Yep. Sweet. Okay. Because it's legendary-- Right. I've been forgetting to roll my enlarged damage. Yep. (high pitched) Yeah, sure. (laughs) How many hits are there?! Wow, had to Reckless, huh? Cool. Okay. Okay. Okay. Can I use my Stone's Endurance on that last one? All right. That's 12. Plus my constitution, which is five, so 17. Shit! So do I add 17 hit points back? Yeah, so just wipe it out? Okay, cool. I'm getting down there. Constitution saving throw. 18. Ten plus ten minus two is 18. Shit! (laughs) He Vulcan Pinched my ass. (slot machine ringing) What? Okay. Like a jackrabbit. (whispers) Fuck. Oh, no, I've seen this before. 23 minus two, 21? Constitution I have a lot of. For my saving throws. Is that the palm thing? Oh, I mean, don't make any special exceptions on my part. Fuck. 52? 51. Okay. I'm out of the triple digits guys. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. (exhales) Good deal. Tight. Wow, distance doesn't help. Okay. I just look up, covered like Carrie, in the movie. Just dripping with fake blood. I would try Intimidating Presence, but he'll just shrug it off because he's amazing. I just take off straight for him. Cool. Awesome. I am going to take all three attacks at Great Weapon Master at him. NOT Reckless. Why?! So that's pretty smart. I threw that literally into the holder and it was on an edge. Shit. That's a natural 20 that's going to be replaced by a not as great (inhales sharply). 23 minus five. So, it'll be a dud. Okay, okay. 31 minus five. 26. (exhales) Oh, thank god. (high pitched) I like it when I hit them. (normal voice) That's 28 plus enlarge. Which I've been forgetting. 20. 18 plus 10 for Great Weapon Master. 28. 30. I said 20 I meant 30. My apologies. He is hitting me really, really hard. It's actually large, it just doesn't do much. I would like to. At disadvantage. That's a one. Oh, god, it's so awesome! (groans) Yeah, I'm checking reflexes. I want you to know I'm not afraid to go down. Oh shit. I hope you get a popcorn kernel in your teeth. Sweep the leg, Johnny! (groans) Yeah. Okay, all hit! Nine, okay. Okay. Okay. Sweet. Real excited. (grunts, spurting blood noise) Yeah, I know. But I still have minus two to them. That's better. 23 minus two, 21. Not the double fist! Look who's catching who now. He didn't have a quip back for me, okay. Right. I would like to turn so I'm facing him. I want to pick him up and try and bodyslam him. Okay. 24. I almost drop out of my rage because that was a real dick move, just dunking on me. He did the Kill Bill on my hands. I want to try one more time. 20. It doesn't matter. I still have a third one, yeah. I just want to try and grab a hold of the slippery bastard. Yeah. Strength, advantage or just natural roll? Okay. 26. Cool. I don't say anything, I'm just really stoked that I actually got him. (everyone laughs) Could I? MARISHA Couldn't hurt the rest of us, either! I was thinking initially I'd like to remove one of his five hits that he takes on me, but, four, who gives a shit. Okay, attack with disadvantage. That's not that great. Oh, regular attack! Yeah, 22. I've still got him grappled at least. That's it. Yeah. Let's just assume that I picked him up. I'm just holding him grappled. Or am I squatting? Hugging Santa's little helper. He closes his eyes? I still have him grappled? I still want to try to get him to the ground. I want to try and get him prone. Can I try a leg wrap, so I'm gonna wrap my right leg around his, and dive forward. Trying to push him off-balance on to his back. Okay. 24. Great. Great! When he's prone, do I get advantage on attacks? Great. Great Weapon Master, dwarven thrower, and I say I want to know the answer to the lesson! (everyone laughs) Okay. 35. Plus the enlarge damage. Uh, 28 minus five, 23. 9, 24, 34, 38. (laughs) No, I would be right there, just entranced that he's actually in the ground. I meant 'I run'! Okay. Okay. Natural 20! Yeah, yeah! And blood and sand. Goddamn, he did that to me on my turn. (laughing) That's fucked up. (everyone laughs) Hits. Okay. Uh, 13 on my constitution saving throw. What was the damage? I'm sorry. Seven. Awesome. Oh, fuck! Can I smile before he hits me? Cool! Great! My math is probably wrong but I'm getting down there. He is. Did he just stand there, and he had a turn? I feel like he's doing that Patient Defense thing again. Yeah, fuck it. I'm going to go for broke. Because we're pretty close anyway. I'm gonna make all three attacks reckless, Great Weapon Master. (laughing) I don't know any better, I don't know. Oh! Is there a small fart at least? Yep. It's not even like something to be proud of. Just a little squeaker. (Scottish accent) A little turtle head poking out. (Normal voice) So I'm stunned-- Cool. I look back, and do this. Yeah. I have no healing anythings. I do if I short rest, but that's it. All right-- How far can I throw this fucking thing? Long range of 60 feet. The long range of 60 feet means that it would be a disadvantage throw? That's not great. Yeah. Yeah, let's be honest. Could I get to him in 50 feet? Yeah, I'd like to try. God! I just wanna keep staring back at him but I don't-- There's no point to it. I can't do anything. It's not like I can psych him out or-- Yeah, going for broke again. Reckless, great weapon master, all three. Okay. Spatial-- Patient Defense. Also known as spatial defense in the barbarian world. Natural 20. So I double the damage die-- or I roll two more damage dice after this. 42. Second one. That's a 31 minus five, 26? (counting) 35. Yep. Last one. LAURA, SAM, and I'm buying a ticket to the no pants dance after this. 20, 22. Oh no no, that's not minus five-- it is minus five. You keep saying that! (strained) Yes, I believe that hits. Okay. Okay, same damage? Okay. 23. Nope, 21. Okay. Yeah. Oof (laughs). Cool (laughs). We in the single digits, kids. (all gasp) 22 minus two is 20. Yeah, yeah. (laughs) I am unconscious, but! I use my relentless rage. Which, it's a flurry of blows, and he only did it on the first one. (all laugh) I do, yes. I do. If I can't make a DC of 10, I don't know. Uh, 21. This is gonna get interesting. (electronic shut down noise) However, I use my relentless rage, now at a DC 15. 27. Good? It's my turn? All three, reckless, great weapon master! Chewing my tongue off while I do it! (all laugh) 29 minus five, 24. Yep. So the first one is... 23, 33, 34. 34 points of damage, first one. Second one, nine, damn it. No, but it's minus five so it's 20. Misses. Oh. I am, yeah. (strained) That's pretty good. That's a 30, minus five is 25. Fuck you, Master Splinter. Yeah, I haven't forgotten it now-- -- 23, 33, 37. Okay, so the first one hits, right? Right, I reach back for the third one and I go, who's good now? (whack) Yes! (laughs) (heavy breathing) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stay there. Right. Little bit of pee comes out. Awesome! I walk over to him. I bow. And then I reach out one of the Titanstone Knuckles. Kord's strength to you. That without the love of my friends, life has no meaning, and I would be nothing. I will make their strength mine, and my strength their own, and in turn, I will try to make the world a better place than I found it. I've never gone that far in a battle before. I didn't even know that was possible. This was incredible. I'm talking a lot, aren't I? I have a bit of a man crush-- Okay. Uh. Thank you. And I turn, and I walk back to my friends. Guys-- (cough) if we could just make our way out of here, in as cool a way as possible... If I fall, just pick me up like Weekend at Bernie's, okay? (all laugh) Vex. You have the spell! I'm back at nine. That sounds great. Yeah? Right? I mean, I got struck by lightning, guys. What? Oh shit, they are. Wow. In its Exalted form, my strength now becomes 26, so plus eight, right? And when I use Enlarge now, I gain resistance to fire, cold, lightning, for ten minutes. Hey, you know? (all laugh) I know, and double damage. And cold. Yeah, so -- Double damage on objects and structures. But that's a lot of resistance to a lot of things. And 26 is... that's really strong. That was awesome. Yeah! I dunno. You know what, we'll probably have to fight somebody to find out, let's find the first person outside of here. I'm at nine. (exploding noises) Oh shit. I'm at nine hit points. Right, well, I do-- I am fond of cats. Man. Thanks for not jumping in on that. It was very personal. Yeah, thank you. I missed it. Encore! Don't. (all laugh) Yeah seriously. (sniffs) No, I need like a million potions, and maybe some attractive naked women to heal me back to my full health. Yeah. Yeah. I'm real cranky so I need bandages, and maybe some bondage, and just all the women. Good! Like a B & B right? That's what the letters for those words are. (all laugh) There are nice stores here, and we haven't even proper shopped in a while.  Or we should check out the stuff that we got out of the den where Raishan was. Yeah. (all laugh) Yeah. Excuse me, has anyone seen my friend Ve-- You. -- beautiful salesman, carrier of all delightful things. Was he uncomfortable seeing you or something? Whatcha got? I'm really hard of hearing. Like, I've been working-- It was like (mimics Matt) It is such a shame. Did you tell him already that we have a whole kingdom's worth of jewelry and gold to spend, and I'm really tired of carrying it. I thought I'd lighten this backpack a little. You go ahead and leave. I'm just gonna yell at him really loud. No, no, no, we'll take it. We'll take it. How much? For the four healing potions and the one greater? Cool! I know how to do this. I take a bag of gold-- -- pour it onto the desk. Just a pile of gold. 1500 gold pieces. Do you not want healing potions, or what? Well, I mean, clearly I have to say they have worked. They've worked every time. Vex. We are so rich. Vax, will you come in here a minute? Will you please tell your sister that we have enough money to fund several townships, and that this guy wants 1500 gold for four healing potions and we have almost none. Yeah, I mean, c'mon, Vax. You're also royalty, so you should show peasants how to act. You know, stiff upper lip, pip-pip. Yeah, I noticed. You've moved up in the world, this is really nice. Is it working out for you? If I wanted your name, like if I wanted to call on you later, 'cause it seems like-- As far back as I can remember, we've run into you quite a bit, and I'm kind of fond of this-- Yeah. Do you have a name? I will not remember that. By the way, did you have any-- --limited exclusive items and, like, top shelf. Your most elite, (clicks tongue) paying customers only? Right. Where's he getting his shipment from? Do you trust your partner? This new guy? I give him ten gold for the information. Oh. Oh! I thank you for your time, Poobah out. And I leave. (all laugh) Look, I know that was hard for you. He was very apologetic. Yup. He was-- yup. No, he didn't. No, look, his hands were on that side of the counter the whole time. Yeah. Mm-hm. Yeah, here, these are for you. Yeah. No, I don't want any, I need more of the hands-on healing, you know what I'm saying? 4d8? 22 I mean, we could take a short rest and let me heal up for a second. Once we land somewhere. I mean, maybe. But didn't you need to go somewhere? Oh. Yeah. Let's at least go see if little lover boy has woken up. How do we get back? We gotta leave the city, though, right? Out of respect. Oh. These rules confuse me, but okay. That was good. Yeah. On the way there, I ask Percy, Percy! Percy. I know this city's, like, being rebuilt and everything-- -- but do you think there will ever be like a pleasure hall, or a house of, you know, bosoms. I mean, I just want to put out like a couple ideas as a city, bound up. Nope, yeah, it's pretty empty right now, I know this. No, no, no, yeah. I'll come up with something better. Yes. (all laugh) With all the flags on it. And six different syrups to choose from in each room. Is it really? Thank god. Smiley face? But I'm just saying, you know, if you need to lean on me to develop that sort of the economy again, I'm here for you buddy. Okay. Let's go find Scanlan. (all laugh) I think strapped up and covered in mayonnaise. Pudding. And Kaylie's sitting in the chair, or is she leaning back on? Can I please knock the legs of the chair out? Yeah. I walk over and I just kick the back leg of the chair out so she falls down. Oh my god, these chairs are so old. Are you all right? Oh right, I forgot, you'll speed bag my nuts later, sorry. Yeah, you proposed to this woman downstairs and this was your bachelor party. Yeah. Vex did. Was that it? That is bullshit. Yes. No, we didn't. Really? Can I ask you a question? No. I was gonna ask you what your mother's name is. I'm sorry I didn't know that. I'm glad you're back. Whatever you want to do now that you are... it's up to you, mate. We did have selfish in-- We didn't think about those things. We didn't. We thought about what you meant to us. It may not feel like much, to us it feels like a bit, but now that you're here... Wait. I reach into the Bag of Holding and I grab my salt-lick rock and I toss it to Scanlan. It's yours now. When you miss us-- I know you will-- give it a lick. Did he take all his things with him? We might've missed him if we had. He's alive. That's what really matters. He needs time. We have that. I step out into the hallway. Do I see Percy at all? Hey. Rough one, that. Question Do you have any, like, sneaky people in your employ here in the castle. Wouldn't you feel better if we had someone just keeping an eye on them? Bit explosive, the two of them together. I don't know if I care. (laughs) Yeah. It'd be half a dozen dead guards, though. Good point. No, yeah. Yeah. I'll go give it a look. Now's good. Yeah, I'll be back after nightfall. Gonna go out for a bit. Yeah. I don't know much, but I do know that. I leave. Highlights. Crying on bosoms. (mock-crying) (all laugh) Yeah. Not my best night. Amazing. Yeah. All right. So, what? First step is the most important one, right? What's the hand? Let's try that. Bottoms up. I'll read this. Like, money? Do we have any of that in the bag of holding? Oh, shit. You're saying somebody could read it, but they'd have to make it all the way through the end. Right. What else have we got? All right. It feels different. Can I make it Imax? What's he rolling for? Can you yell at him? Yeah. (quietly) Dick. (louder) Sorry, what? Let's go. What clears the brain better than travel? (sniffs) Or sex. Period. Yeah, I'm just bummed, because I'm glad he's alive-- I think that's what keeps us from being terrible. But like-- (sniffs) I only trust like a few people in the world. You, Scanlan, and Pike. And now it's just you and Pike. No, I mean I trust the others, right, but like... I know you on a more intimate level. Pretty much. Yeah. Um. So. That's all. I just-- I just feel a little more sad on the inside. But I'm all right. Yeah. I'm glad he's okay. No, it's not right, right now. Yeah, you know. It's... mmm. You know. (all laugh) An hour. What, are you going after treasure? Are you famous? How thick is the book? (surprised) Oh. 18! Lots of scribbles in that book. Can I insight check Asshole? Is it perception or what on that? We are actually-- We are currently under-- We are currently employed right now. We're on a very, very dangerous mission. However, it ends here. So, if you have the coin, and maybe if you prove yourself not to be too much of a lag-behind. Percy, what do you feel like-- He's an adventurer. (all laugh) Like Kenneth Branagh in Harry Potter. What does he do? Does he just write stuff? (laughs) (quietly) I'm gonna move over here. Your men, are you-- Oh. What else is on your list, what're you looking for? Just give me one. What kind of weapons does he have on him? Is it movable? Now that is fucking great. So wait, you want to come with us, or you want us to come with you? Yeah! So dangerous. It's a test of your reflexes, on point, how you handle things you're not quite ready for. You don't like him, right? He probably does. Keyleth, you don't like him very much, right? But like, 50,000 gold and we have ourself a very flamboyant distraction if we need it. He's in. He's fucking in. Look at the battle axe! Holy shit! He's not. I'm a dark wizard. Yeah. Is there a fighting arena in Marquet, or anywhere we could find a scrap if we wanted to? No. And I grab his hands with the Titanstone Knuckles-- -- and squeeze. Don't -- -- summon the dragon. Uh, what? -- baby dragon Well, I thought you were being taken over. D'you need me to make sure you're all right? He comes. C'mon. Besides I wanna see him get in a fight, let's audition him at least. I love him. (gasps) Oh, I'm gonna love Tary so much! I'm gonna love him so much. Seriously? An invisible-making coin? This is just my gut reaction though. MARISHA. Even if you're impressed, we pretend like we're not. Pretend like you're not impressed. Yeah. It's the most amazing thing! I mean, hold on! Not impressed. I wanna shoot it! (all laugh) Yeah, oh shit, take it back. That's cool. He stays. Or you can kill him and take the weapon later. Tary berry. That was amazing.
