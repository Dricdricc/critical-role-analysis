Caffeine and drugs. I chew on Goku's head a lot. I'm a fixated-- it's cool. Go get one! What a response! Yes we do, the response to this live event was so amazing that we are super stoked to announce that we are going to also be doing Critical Role live in Indianapolis during GenCon on August 6, Saturday night. Tickets will go on sale- I think they're on sale now. Right now, so if you want to like, silently on your phone or just ignore it because it's a much bigger venue, so tickets should be available, but we're all going to be in Indianapolis on Saturday night and GenCon to roll some dice with you bitches live. (cheering) Pressure's on, dude, pressure's on! You're gloomy. Lock it up, here we go. Is the little satyr-- is he holding onto my skirts, basically? Right, so can I like, how far away is that guard that's on our tail? Oh yeah. Can I like super slyly whisper, okay, so at any point are you going to tell us what it is you want us to fucking steal? It's really quite normal for me. Oh, you're so right. Hey, pull my finger. (fart sound) Yeah. That's the family reserve. Oh, he said we're supposed to find somewhere quiet to talk. What? What? Oh, it's like the new rage amongst the kids. It gives me super street cred. Yeah, ix-nay on the Garmelie-- I think I'm doing Pig Latin wrong. Yeah. No, just seriously, you seem super gloomy. Are we getting in a fight? Hi. If we say "bidet?" Bidet. Oh, bidet. Oh, yeah. Bidet. The name is Grog. Bidet. (laughter) Yeah, do that shit! Fucking shit. Just a heads-up, pro tip dragons can fly. (laughter) Of the dragons? (laughter) I've clearly lost your father. It's all right. Of the Conclave. Just so you know, what they did against the dragons was incredible. All of the rest of us were like, "Ah! Oh, we're dying! We don't have anything we can do!" And then they were like "Kill! Stab!" And then-- And then they killed them all! It's the only reason we're alive, really. I mean, the balls on this one-- this one. Lord Grog Peanut Butter of Strongjaw. I'm titled. I thought we weren't getting in a fight! Holy shit. You should thank Percy. No promises? Right. Sorry. The House of Peanut Butter will continue its bloodline. I don't know. Are we doing that now? Penis wiggle! (laughter) Bidet. MARISHA and I lean over to Scanlan and I say, did you notice that their dad was saying "bidet" wrong? I thought he was like a highfalutin type. I know. We could be a force for good in and outside of the city. Bidet! Change is hard. What? We're a very religious group and we like to have a family prayer. No, she's here. Fucking Verizon. (laughter) Do you need anything, drinks? Then-- oh, what? Oh, yeah! Well, let's all head inside for prayer. That's not it. Gormidi? Now, hold on. Did you steal anything while you were in there? Insight-check that bitch! Just let it happen. Come on, keep going. You've never stolen anything, shit! All right, hands off him. No problem. What else? Her hat? So weird, you pickpocketed the thing that wasn't even expensive. Y'all should totally fight right now. Just fight in the room while we're all here and take off your clothes. Only way to solve it. Yep. You have hair on your spine? Pretty sweet. So we have the meeting, we go get the tricorn hat from her, like, boudoir and then we go get the crest on the way out, right? Or maybe we could send one of the shitty guards to go "shedule" it for us. I don't think they're going to leave us all alone. Bidet! Have we seen any of these threshold crests on our way in? Don't say it like it's obvious. I don't pay attention to shit. Right, so like, I could take Vax's head and smash it against one and then pick up the pieces. No, that's a bad thing from your frown. I mean, we have jewels and shit, just stuff hanging around, but what does that do? Ooh! Like a souvenir. "Can we have a piece of your threshold crest?" Shit, I have got all the good ideas today. (laughter) Yeah. Ah, very good. Yep. Well, we waste no time. Four? Wait, Scanlan, can't you go invisible too? What if you two little buggers just went off and like found it on your own while we were distracting Captain Fancy Hat. Yeah, you go invisible along with Fauny Tim over here and you just go find the fucking hat. Yeah. We kill everybody. (laughter) Tarantino film. Shit. All right, she lives. Oh, just pick one. There are 300 fucking dice on this table. Can I look around the room? Are there any doors open, ajar, leading into a bedroom with a hat on a rack? 19. Natural. That's good. Yep, I pull out the rhinoceros horn. And I say to the side, I go, (coughs) pinch my knee, is that the one? Yeah, no, (coughs) pinch my knee if that's the one. No, to the little, to the little satyr. Yeah. Nine. (laughter) Good start. I'll join you. Two. Yeah, there's nothing in here. Let's go. All right, I want to reach in and grab something out of there too. All right, fine! I take a bite out of it. Oh here you go. And I squash it in my hand. We leave. I don't know if you guys noticed, but there was this recessed door up in the queenie's room, but I don't know if maybe she would have some fancy stuff back there. Can't shake these guards. Well, I don't know. I just noticed, because I wasn't paying attention to all the talking. We don't want to go try and bust one of the crests we already saw? Who gives a fuck? I didn't think that far ahead, I'm sorry. Thank you, Scanlan. Yeah, we're fucking close, man. Oh yes, we're very holy. I told you we were holy. I fart. (laughter) We're going this way. Follow me, chaps! I'm going to kill you later. Garmelie, how far of a journey is it to this bog? That doesn't mean anything to me. A hot nap? Yeah, let's get going. I don't think that applies here. That makes it even worse. You're still going in the same direction. I have a hooded lantern. I could set this whole fucking thing ablaze. First doors, then grass. Right, so we're going through the brushy moon? Bob. I'm so stoked right now. Thank you, Loot Crate!
