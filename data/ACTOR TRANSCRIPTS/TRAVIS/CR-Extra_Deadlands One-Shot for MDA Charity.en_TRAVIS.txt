That's incredible. He's got to run into the other studio. He's got to take the elevator down to Studio-- oh, hey! Don't buy him shit. (laughter) Don't jump the... (dramatic pause) gun, Liam. (groans, laughs) Oh, snap. Okay. Wait, what was your name again? Oh. I don't even want to go anymore. (laughter) Yes, my name is Sydney Hopkins Trivelpiece. I have come from afar to chronicle the adventures of the Wild West while you seek your fortune in your misdeeds. I am afraid I'm not well-adapted to this climate, but I am quite interested in your journeys for gold or glory. Reverend, you look quite the outstanding gentleman. I don't drink, but a good, clean glass of water does sound lovely. You smell terrible, and I'm not quite sure how I feel about you, but if you know of anything going on that would make a good story for me, that could really help my career. I'm very light. I don't eat very much. If I'm in the sun too long, terrible things happen. (laughter) Taint-sniffer. Just three. Yeah, thank the Lord. (laughter) You are! Really? Show us one. Where's that what? Said it twice, didn't get it. Each card has a thing? You're very intimidating. Nothing, nothing. Son of a bitch! How long would it take? Somebody throw me a pen back there. Yes! I do hate to trouble you. Does anyone see the chamberpot in the room? I am afraid I have a rather-- need. Out the window? Right. Okay. Reverend? Do you remember what happened last night? A sarsaparilla for me, if you don't mind. That's very kind of you! There is chivalry alive in the west! Two of them are in? Two of the three? I don't think so. I believe he had what they call the nuts. I would like to rush over to him and offer him asylum in our room. Sir, you are impeccably dressed. Please, follow me to my room upstairs. Quickly! It means orderly. The opposite of chaos. Not to worry. Oh dear. I'm afraid she's lost her beans. Sir, do you happen to know his name? Oh, yes, of course. Hold out your hat and I'll transfer them. That looks about it. There you go. Do I roll something? That's a six, and a two, so eight. Oh, I am Sydney Hopkins Trivelpiece, at your service. Lovely meeting you. You seem to be very good at this game. Yes, it's very difficult in this climate. Simon. Absolute pleasure. Sir, how did you get to be so good at that game? What is it you do here? Wonderful, you seem to be quite successful at-- poker, you say? Goodness. If I may say, if you find anyone having particular luck in that gold boom, would you mind sending word my way? I write to a very famous publication. I could put you among the stars. Yes, this room, with a few traveling compatriots of mine. Watch out for some. Others are smelly. Some are trustworthy and others are quite strange. I come down as well after he leaves. You beautiful people. Yes. (chip dropping on floor) Shit. That's you. Madness! Your wife or your son was a victim? I'm so sorry to hear that. It's a bit small... Second thoughts? That's quite the responsibility, I hope you know. Sheriff Bullock! Was there a particular area that these attacks were taking place? The doc, yes. Perhaps we should go find this doc? (gasps) Shut the fuck up. Are you serious? We're going to need help! Could we find our way quickly, please? Is there any horse shit on the ground? I really would care to stay out of it. A red Dixie cup. Is it street wise or smarts? I got it! I'm a journalist! Okay, I'd like to reroll with a black. That's better. Four! Yeah, Sydney Hopkins Trivelpiece here. I was just curious if the the doctor was within? (nervous laugh) Yes. This one. She was quite rude. Oh, snap. Why would you do that? You can do it, but you've got to roll a minus two to it. I'm hurting. I'm hurting, y'all. How ghastly! Oh, no, no! Okay. Oh, good gracious. Stinky Jules. Same time, do it same time. LAURA and Yeah, it's made of lye, it's for cleaning yourself with. You don't say. Quite glad to be out of there. Salty Jules, I was wondering, would you mind if in my notepad I did a small sketch of your bear cub? I do fancy him so. Yes, yes. Would you mind if I looked after him and maybe did some drawings? Yes, I would love to look after him, if that's all right. I just-- All right. Whisky, love, whisky, and chocolate. I hope he'll be as affectionate with me. May I? Oh, thank you. And I would like to grab the bear and try to cuddle it. No, no! Did you give it a name? Trinket. Oh yes. Like a little cork. Hello, Trinket. It is your Uncle Sydney. My parry is six. My toughness is five. I'm quite shaken! He's so lovely. Quite a voracious little energetic one. I'm still-- my god. Can you see the flesh? Quite cute. Well, perhaps we should go to this Mr. Swearengen's place, see what the people in his employ were actually up to. Thank you, yes, I do a lot of reading. Yes, of course. This way. Mind the horseshit. To each their own. Reverend, avert your eyes. Hello! That sounds awful. We may have someone that might be able to help you. My name is Sydney Hopkins Trivelpiece. If you don't mind, sir, what is your name? Oh, shit. That's not bad. That's balls. I'm going to spend a reroll. Oh, I do reroll the eight if I use a black chip? Oh, thank god. Hey! Eight! 15! My writing hand. Dan Doherty. Oh, pussy, yes. I'm sorry, could I ask you all a question? I've always been quite curious about the employment of the American whore. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind if I went and interviewed one for my journal. Perhaps you could do me the queries here, and I might leave you for a moment? Yes. Just curious, Padre. I don't know quite what your denomination is-- Oh, Protestant, lovely. So would you care to perhaps get an adjoining room? Just because I'm afraid I'll feel rather exposed upstairs. No, just perhaps join me for a trip down the old lane? It was a double-blink. To speak to one, yes. Yes, I would like to acquire one whore, please. Ten dollars. Is that a going rate in the States? Ten dollars it is, yes. Ten dollars. Quiet room. Hopefully secluded from the others. Sometimes reaching's all that needs to be done. That's a four. Four. Shit, still a four. Yeah, why not? Fucking dick-licking piece of-- five. Yeah, why not? What is the deal? There's no-- Yes! I have giblets. This is terrible! With my sleeves rolled up. She was very forthcoming. Gave me quite a bit of difficulty at first, but-- oh, what happened here? Which way is Dan facing in relation to me? Mr. Schwerengen, Sydney Hopkins Trivelpiece. We're on a mission to find-- Stinky Jules, be quick about it. Your meeting. No reason. The gentleman in the lobby seems very aggressive. I would ask if I may speak. Oh. Lovely. Sydney Hopkins Trivelpiece, at your service, from the great country of England, here to chronicle the glory and power of the Wild West. You, sir, your name has quite the renown-- Yes, well, point of fact, I am from Tawnyland, and by route of Shepardshire. But I took a barge and landed in the beautiful state of Mississippi. Six. Ten. That's Simon he's speaking of. Understood. The hand is hurting quite a bit. Yes, I do believe it was two of your men that were torn asunder by this horrible creature. So $400 for the silver and $200 for the beast. Yes, yes. Mr. Schwerengen, I am quite familiar with Cy's establishment. I was just saying, I have information. I was just saying, I could lead these intrepid band of investigators over to Cy's place and-- Yes, Cy. He runs the-- what is the name of the saloon-- The Bella Union. Oh, wait, that's where we had our... Stairs. What did you do to her? I'll be with you shortly. Mr. Doherty? If I may. The whore that I was able to interview upstairs. What was her name? The red-haired one. Lovely blue eyes. Virginia, yes. Would you do me a favor and follow up with her in a bit. I did do quite a number on her. I just want to make sure that she's all right. I was quite proud of myself. Anyway. Oh, Stinky Jules! Unfortunately, Sue knocked all the teeth out of the woman she was trying to tell the fortune for. Dan, here, was about to put a hole in her head again, so we're going to-- Perhaps we should find our way to this spot. Bartender, may I have some whisky? Could you pour it on this hand? It's throbbing quite badly. Mr. Schwerengen has said-- It's her foreign tongue, I'm sure. Stinky Jules, could you pour some whisky on my hand? I'm afraid it's infected. I'm feeling a bit feverish. I feel-- oh, please, careful now. (yelps) Oh, it's quite pus-ridden. It feels wonderful. Quite. Careful. Thank you. Yes, if you don't mind. Mr. Trivelpiece. Oh, no, no, that's quite all right. I must learn to be as tough as the lands I am interviewing. I don't know where that is. Minus two for me, if I don't have it? I'm going to add a blue chip, because that sucked so much. So five. Yes, it's quite all right. He shakes his head no. A gunshot? Come on, Trinket. I run down to the poor individual. And while they're with Simon, I would like to be with the guy that's holding the gun and torn open. Is he alive? Is he? I bend down and say-- Reverend, perhaps you could speak some calming words to Mr. Farnum. You know, the Reverend is quite good at calming the nerves. He has quite the touch. Your wounds seem to have healed miraculously. Perhaps I can walk you there. I'll be with you in one moment. I chase after Charlie and I put my hand on his shoulder and I say, dear sir, might I get a quote for my book? Or rather, may I give you one? (deep voice) "Well, some people don't get to escape death." And I take my bowie knife out of my sleeve and I stab him in the heart and turn the wound so it opens. I'm going to reroll the strength check. That's an eight. That's a six. That's a 14. How do I roll damage? Oh, sorry, this guy. Five. Ten. Oh, I'm sorry, 11. Three. 14. Oh, no, no, someone come quickly! It seems his wounds have been extremely grievous! Oh, please, somebody help Charlie! Oh, my dear, oh, I wasn't quite ready for this. Please, I'm afraid his blood will get in the bear wound. Don't fucking touch-- yes, yes. The whisky alone would be great. Okay. I'm going to reroll that. Yes! So that's a seven. I'm going to add a d6. That is nine. Oh wait, no, seven plus three is ten. I'm really not quite prepared. I was only trying to escort him back. Oh, well. I suppose-- The bear is just here. Is anyone adept at tracking such an animal? Yes, of course! Well, of course, it'd be my pleasure! Shall we? Those are like in the vault. They're very rare. Would you pray for me as well? It burns when I pee. I think it might have had something to do with last night. No. Oh, okay! Just the ladies? Oh good! At least I have one more now. I have two chips. Two chips! Just saying! Yeah. If you finish this game and you have chips on your table--- It's already been done. Like, or don't like? Thank you! Wait, wait, wait, didn't Swearengen say that Cy had bought all of the gold and silver mines? You don't think that Cy could be... Oh yes, George Hurst, actually. Troubling. Troubling. Troubling thoughts. I think George Hurst's establishment would be a good place to visit. I would love to. Is it tracking-- yeah, it's tracking. Six, four. That was a good stack. What do you see? Not in the terribly condemned, haunted-looking-- (high-pitched) Me? Look, I've already got quite a bit of blood on my sleeve. I was not quite prepared for this. Maybe I could draw the outside of this establishment. I'll go, all right, fine. And I'll go up to the entrance of the mine? Investigation, okay. Ooh, four. Ooh, five! I'll take the five. My fellows, this appears to be a silver mine. Crazy. Yes, he is. Unless he was wounded by the gun that poor late Charlie was holding. It must be empty, then. Stinky Jane, um, Jules. Why don't you take a look inside? I do too! Lead the way. I'm sure it's totally empty. I'm right behind you. I take offence to that, good sir. Should we explore, perhaps see if anything was left behind? It-- it does pulse quite a bit. DONATION I'm quite thirsty too. I have a bit of cottonmouth going on. (pained) Motherfuck-- I would appreciate it if you didn't quite press on it quite that hard. Toss that blue. Send it flying. (pants) It's so hot in here, isn't it? I do feel perhaps it's the lantern (pants) and I'll actually take off the outer coat and really just roll up the shirt. I feel like I'm earning my marks. I'm quite proud. Oh no. Um. I don't suppose any of you had gas, just then? Uh, hello? What thing? No! Yes, but could we take a moment to consider that it was boarded up? Oh! Thank you. What is this for? Last night? Yes, jolly good! Yeah, it's a d10. Yeah, she wanted to re-roll the trait die. I said that's supposed to be mine! Ladies first. Pick a card. I'm going to add one to mine. Five. Go ahead, Father. I kneel down and I say, oh! Look, a weapon! And I pull out of my boot a bowie knife, and I would like to rush the creature. Oh shit, what do I roll? Nine. Oh, that's right, sorry. That was d6, for a four. So let me add-- Oh, fuck, balls, ass. Okay, well, let's try it. That was worse. The six. One. Three. Five. A total of five. Six. Five. I'm leaking. (yelps) Please! Help me! $68,000, just $2,000 away! That's a big fucking cat. I mean, there are three of them left, right? (low voice) I think-- (normal voice) I think we kill the motherfuckers. We chase them down. I'm sorry. I'm losing quite a bit of blood. Reverend, if you would be so kind. (grunts) (low voice) You fucking bitch! And I hit her back. I'm terribly sorry, I have quite the temper. I'm bleeding from the throat. DONATION Please-- Besides the pressure, it's doing nothing, my dear. Don't even need to shuffle it. Nine. Well, once more into the (deep voice) fucking breach. I throw both bowie knives that I have in my sleeves, and I tear after him, just run at him, both knives out. Matt, I'm going to reroll this one. I'll leave that there. Okay, so that's six. And I would like to add a blue chip. Can I add more than one chip to a roll? I can send it back. So that's 16 total. Well, actually, I thought I was just doing one, so. Hey, I guess I did all that on the first hit. Okay, an additional d6. Six. Ten. My second bowie knife. That was a five. That's nine. I'm going to reroll that. That was short. I can't believe I shorted it. That was even worse. That was a one. Oh, with the plus two is three. Five. (deep voice) Well, ain't that some fucking shit. Or we could get a good ending. Two wounds, because you went ten over. Oh, I hated that fucking accent anyway. I want to see what you look like on the inside. And I shove a blade right under his belly button and open him up from bottom to top. Yeah, Deadlands! (cheering) Oh, excuses, excuses, dead people. Absolutely. Yeah, 100%. OFF- Caught what she caught, huh?
