Yeah we do! You guys are a sight for sore eyes! Hi, Matt. Yeah, no. He's just a love and (snoring). He dictates all. I know. Loved the birthday song, it was such great energy. You guys did so good. Oh good! I'm writing this down. It's real! Guys can get it, too! Quit putting your sex toys on the desk, man. Keep them underneath. That's the DM at work. Yeah, we got new baby magic, man. I'll take it where I can get it. Beautiful. Keep going, yeah. Do it for your son. Nice job, babe. A-one. Top shelf. I have a question. Where do I add the +2 to strength for the dad strength I have now? (laughter) Pay attention! No, we got our thumbs. Where is-- Where is Yasha? They took her out of here. They were-- Is the room clear? Did you take care of all of them? There were so many. You did? Shak√§ste? I didn't see him. Caduceus, I'm Fjord. Appreciate your help. Yeah. The caravan. We couldn't see you. We could barely see anything. We were stuck, they had us gagged and bound. I swore I heard a few voices, but we were moving before we knew it. It's not your fault. They were a nasty bunch. Lorenzo was not what he seemed. Fuck! I'm sorry. We should have seen them coming, heard them. We just weren't expecting it. It doesn't feel that way. Yasha. Yasha doesn't know. They'd beat the fucking hell out of us, and then if there was anything left, one touch, and that was it. Darkness. Whoever was paying. I think they were trying to work on our minds first. Sounds like Yasha got the physical part next. It was a long night. I preferred it to the beating, though. Probably ours. I'm sorry. I don't even know what to say. Pretty positive. Yeah, you did. You could have let us go. I wouldn't be telling you the truth if I didn't say I didn't consider it for a couple days. Beau got a big ol' butt. Yeah. What about his jacket? People need killing if that happened, so, you know. He's done it before? Oh, right. Lucien? Lucien. You're right. I would be honored to have this sword. Caleb. Thank you. Maybe we can hold on to some of those gags. Okay. None of that happened. No. You've done a marvelous job, and we can't thank you enough. Let us help you with whatever-- Yeah, please, get us the fuck out of here. Yeah. Shouldn't we try and wake up Yasha? She's just out because of the effect of the-- Travel for hire, bribery-- Tools and materials, delivered goods polished. That rogue shit. Maybe it's another haversack? I got an idea. I'll take one of these long swords and I'll put it in the bag. Too late. It's happening. Motherfucker! Ooh, that's right. What's in it?! True, yeah. Are there any books in his room specifically for Caleb? Piece of shit ability, is that what you mean? Heal, Jester. Did we see Caduceus upstairs? Before we get back down to Caleb I say do you need a hand? Oh. Okay. I'll go back down-- From downstairs? Roots. Yeah, roots. Sure. Yeah, no I've had a carrot. Do I smell anything in the-- no, it smells like breakfast. Fuck it. I go back downstairs. (laughter) Yep. Polished... Erased. You don't want to get a little healing first in case there are fucking hyenas outside or some shit? Oh that counts. Bone bears? Yeah, I was going to say we do have cover here, right? That is a good point. Okay, let's take it easy. Yeah. One's just fat and never moves. We didn't find any books upstairs, sorry. Bottomless bag? If you knew how to bargain, maybe. How about I hold it for you? (singing) Tradition! Wow! Is there light in where we are? Is there torchlight or anything in the lower space? Can I take the bag and hold it up under a light source and look in, see if there's stuff rumbling around and it just looks empty? Can I shake it, does it make any noise? I'll reach in and just grab the inside of it and turn it out, see if there's stuff. Yeah. I have deep arcane ability. No, I just turned it inside out, and all this shit poured out. (Harry Potter voice) I'm a what? (Hagrid voice) And a thumpin' good one, I'd wager. Shit. Oh, fuck! Physical props! Oh my god, this is so awesome. That a peach? Jester, will you hold up that letter so that I can see the drawing, please? Doesn't everybody? It looks like an eye. I just sit down on the floor and lean back against the wall. No. Well-- That's not true, I have. I've been there-- I've been to those harbors before. Many times. No, I don't think so. Human jerky? Where the fuck have you guys been? Down underneath, in the well. What do they call those people? Merrow. No, I didn't. Can I see it for just a second? I'll give it right back. Seven. Evan-tee-ca? Ev-ahn-tica? "Tell him you have a gift for the Captain when you see Marius--" "LePual at the Wayfarer's Cove." (inhale) Well, I have the cloven crystal. I do not have access to it at the moment. Please. Stop. Maybe we should have Caleb check out some of these items. I mean, what if this meat hook, like, you know-- -- is magic; you throw it and it comes back to you or some shit. The two dozen teeth, are there any of the tusk variety? Can I take that? What is that? Can we see through it? Does sound come out of it? Do I hear them talking? Are you okay? I'm going to try and push my hand through. (yells) Cool. Oh god it's magnified. It's unbelievable! Human jerky! First game back. Yeah, how tall is Caduceus? Appreciate you. Well. I'll go gather up the money and the teeth and the meat hook and the red gem and all that shit in the bag. And then turn it back out. I brought you stuff to identify. Meat hook? Damn it. What's it do? Yeah, probably. Six shortswords. I'll make sure Caleb's square. A creature of fire? Are we taking a long rest? Before I turn in, can I sit with Molly's sword? Staring at it. Thank you, you were very kind to me. I hope to do right by you and make it up to you one day. And I'll try to concentrate on the sword. Yeah, I'm kind of like this bag of holding, huh? Yeah. I don't know. I want to keep Molly with us, though. With me. Why don't you make it two hours? You're explaining too much. Atta girl. Oh shit! Medallion of cigar smoke. Medallion of stogies. You fucking know it. Yeah, I didn't do nothing. Fucking secret Santa in this bitch! (wheezing) That's fucking great! The immediate regret! (laughter) Oh yeah?! Oh, amazing. You can see it! I forgot to ask. Before we do anything else, Lorenzo's glaive, his weapon, did we get that? Yeah, I'll go grab it and give it to Caleb. If it had spelled the end of one of my closest friends I know I would want it, so we should probably keep it for Yasha when she wakes. In the Bag of Holding. It's pretty big. We don't have to do that. Glad you guys are keeping track. Caduceus, can I ask what your involvement is? How you became involved in this? He makes what? You make dead people into tea. Should we wait for Yasha to wake up, or do we bring her with? She's got a day and a spell. Yeah, I figured. Kind of already was, but yeah. Let's do it. I put her in the Bag of Holding and-- (laughter) It's not the tarp that's the source of the illusion. We'll take it. Between the stealth cart and the dome, we're going to be rolling dirty. Caduceus and Caleb. That's right. I'll ride a horse. Reunion. That was almost forensic. Today! There's no branding we have to worry about? Oh shit! You can do that too, huh? Well, I don't want to be the only one. I'll make myself a disheveled brunet-looking guy with a sick-ass goatee. Birds galore. What are we doing? We've met with her already? How did it go? I hope you have some extra hands. We're going to be picking up very heavy equipment and lugging it all the way from the house back to the gate if we can't bring the cart in. I don't mind, it's just-- (coughs) I would tell this cart that we'll be right back. Stay put, cart. I open up the Bag of Holding and pull out Lorenzo's glaive. What in the hot fuck is going on with her? Yeah, okay. We were supposed to escort her back. I'm sure she has more business with The Gentleman, no? We were going to stop on the way back, though, weren't we? No, it's not. Bit off more than we could chew by us saying yes to both. Dusk. Maybe we'll wait for her outside the gates? With our cart. The guards, or the people that she has working for her, are they wearing any sort of face protection, head protection, or is it open? Can I ask, in your previous engagements with her, how far are we trusting her? LIAM and No, superficial, yeah? Yeah, and good things come from shit, right? Like flowers? You didn't travel much? Living? We asked this, I'm sure. You're-- (whispering) He's alive, right? (strained) Cool, yep. Musty as shit? Yeah, okay. Like sandalwood, kind of? Yasha wakes up (startles) Of course. Yeah, which ones? I guess I'm up front with Caduceus. 12. The dodecahedron. Caleb, what about your cat? No, I'm leaning over the carriage like Hey what about your gato? Status quo. Holy shit. I'll hop off the carriage and walk over. Staring at the coat, I'll summon the new sword. In the way that I was taught by Vandren, I extend the sword to my side, bring it up in a salute, swing it back down. I've met a lot of people, but I don't think I'll ever meet another character as unique as you, Molly. While they were coming to rescue us-- Yasha-- I've said it before, but I'm sorry we weren't here. To help. We haven't known each other that long, but you've shown us incredible kindness and care, and I'm very grateful for that. I will return the favor, if it's ever needed. I've never had many favors done my way. Out of game, how long have we been gone? When did we leave Zadash? We've been gone for-- Feels like a year. You got a lucky rock? Oh! Hey, man. Old trick's the best trick. 101 platinum, 131 gold. Yes. We threw it and it landed in her pocket when she ghosted out. We're going to have an introductory period. You stay for two weeks and then we give you your money. Dope. Holy Jesus. Yep. Oh my god. As were heading down, I'll drop my Mask of Many Faces. Kutha, how's it been? Yeah, very talkative for him, actually. Got hundreds, y'all! They all have a little collection of our blood in vials. Boy, is it efficient! Everything I want is now in condensed-- Could I get The Gentleman's attention and say This adventure has been thorough. A name came up in our travels, and I was wondering if you may have heard of someone, a Marius LePual. SAM and Marius LePwel. Pwal. P-U-A-L. Appreciate it. Do you have any milk? Please Roger Rabbit-- Yeah! Drink it! A milk chaser for your whiskeys? How did we not go there first! Oh my god. You got any Kahlua back there? Can I find-- is it Kara? We were gone for a while. When we left, Zadash was in a it of a tizzy. How is it in the city? Troop presence about the same? Any coming back? Any wounded, any--? No incursions, no security problems? Thank you. Thank you. I don't think I take compliments very well. Yeah. Whiskey! You got out of that without any liquor on you. Real impressive. Cheers. Yeah, it-- More the disappointment. I expect better of myself. Let you guys down, I let Jester down, I let Yasha down. I'll never be able to shake this. No, I don't. No, I get that. I do. You don't understand, though. My whole life was trying to blend in, trying to keep an eye out for someone that was looking to take advantage, that was going to exploit. I got comfortable. I felt relaxed. There's no reason why the three of us out on watch couldn't see them coming out and raise an alarm fast enough. I'll drink to that. Yeah. It puts everything in perspective, though, I'll tell you that much. I was floating around, trying to find my way to the Cerberus. I don't know if that's what I want to do anymore. I felt like I almost died and I hadn't taken care of any of the shit that got me here in the first place. I was so worried about trying to learn about these new abilities that-- I felt like I got distracted. I have people I want to find and things I want to remedy. I mean, fuck, it's really disturbing. Like, she came out of there like a little kettle of popcorn, just no problem. I mean-- Can I see Jester? Is she nearby? I was worried. There were really dark times. I would hear Jester singing to herself at night and then she'd change lyrics, and then my name would be in the lyrics sometimes. Every morning, she would try and cheer everybody up that was around her, but she had the muffle? So I couldn't tell if my brain was playing tricks on me, or if she was just-- I don't think there's much that gets her down. It's kind of inspiring. An act? It is kind of fucked that there's no music right now, and she's just-- That was well placed. You've heard it before? Did you have a lot of cemetery folks that were good for good-natured ribbing? Yep. How's your face feel? He's pretty tall. He's a big guy. Oh! You know what you're going to be good for when it's cold? Fucking hot toddies. I bet you make a great hot toddy. Out of some dead folks' feet. (singing) Oh, life is going to unfold in front of you! Hear, hear. Yeah, it is. Oh, definitely the bathhouse and Pumat, right? It's been like a month. He's got to have some cool shit. Sure. (sniffs) (laughter) Raphael, the mason? I didn't really swallow the last one. It just kind of absorbed. Jonos! No, nobody knows about its current origins. We just know who was looking for it and who it was supposed to go to. Yeah? Yeah, I thought that was just the bone-dogging look. Matching Gucci luggage? That was a good bail-out. Aren't you going to yell the name out? (shouting) Antigua! Antigua! SAM and Did it work? Keep going! Follow that thread! Pull on that string! Super hammered, we stumble out. You have cherry bombs? The fuck those come from?!
