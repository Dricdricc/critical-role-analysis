(burps) Probably not. We're struggling to keep up. (whip crack) Stone. Soap-stone. He's a good little worker. She didn't say my fucking name. (laughter) This is a sportsball. I would watch every episode of that. I would correct nothing. The lined of scrimmage. Nope, fuck that. Damn, that would be awesome. If you have a real Heisman trophy, please, send it to our PO box. I will take that. For one episode. If I get a legitimate Heisman trophy. Yes, I'll do a whole thing of Sportsball. If you give me a Superbowl ring that's worth 45 grand? Yeah. (laughter) Diamond-encrusted, super well-paid, yeah, I'll do that. We'll have lasers and smoke and all sorts of shit. -- Tetris. Fucking twins. Don't look at me, I have a tour to give. What? They don't wash their hands? That's really disgusting. We do gotta wait for Uncle OG. By the way, since I'm the tour guide, do you have any plume-y hats? You know? 'Cause if you take like a campus tour, they have a flag and they're like, "Over here!" In case you get lost. Or like when tourists walk around and they're like, "Don't get left-- mm." Do you have anything like that? Good. It'll be good, it'll be like Karate Kid with the toy when he starts spinning it. Oh, bells in my face. (laughter) I have a question for Astra. Best name ever! New favorite. Asterix, look, is there anything in Whitestone that you would fancy? Like, do you have any particular interests, whether they be art or education or geometry or buildings? Right. Did you want to see just the castle, or did you want the grand deluxe Poobah tour, which is around Whitestone as well? That's what I mean, yeah, that was a really good deal. Okay. Let me confer with my subordinate and we'll put together a tour package. Okay. Hey, Percy? So Asterix says that she wants history of Whitestone and the castle, so like, I need a hotlist of things that we're gonna show her, but can we make it sound like I thought of it? Okay, good. Just keeping you on your toes, mate. I like him. Shit, we don't even need the servants for that. I just pop out the chalice, little morning beer. Sunrise. Oh, shit. Oh god. Years? He is, he's very grown. Yeah, you fucked up. Gohan, what happens when Uncle Ogden has too much, you know, (drinking sound). Life begins anew in Whitestone! Does Ogden seem to grow younger as he finishes the beer? Okay. Never know. Never know. Oh, you did? Oh, great. When do I get to see it? That's lucky. Wow! This is-- it jingles! It jangles! This is an official Whitestone tour hat? Yeah! Now, is there a long history of distinguished tour leaders before me? Yes. Percy, you should tell them the short names for my titles. You know. What was it, like Silly Bean, and Sweet Chestnut? Yeah! (laughter) Please rise, rise! It's going to be a lovely day. We have a lot ahead of us, we do. Please. Is it, like, well-balanced? I have to hold it? I'd be worried about circulation up there, but it's not really a concern. Ooh! Fuck you! (laughter) I was cool until the strap came in. I hate those fucking straps! It is time for the tour of Whitestone! Oh, that's okay. I like it when they're loud, actually, I relate. Yep. All right, Percy, time to learn about your castle. And I take off in a walk where you don't bend your knees, your legs just stay straight? That's the walk I'm adopting for this whole tour. I've decided. No, like you kick your heel forward, like-- Like a military. No, I'm doing it. I'm walking! Oh this foyer of Whitestone Castle was defended by myself and these fellows against the onslaught of dragons, giants, and hordes of undead. It has been in the de Rolo family for millennia. Is that what the word is? Yep. Yep. (laughter) Natural beauty, it abounds. It all comes from the Sun Tree in the center of town. (whispers) Percy, help! Asterisk is interested. No, no we don't, we don't, nope, no. Enough with, like, the boring shit. Do we have like an armory that we can bring them, where they make weapons? Okay. We now venture along these roads cast through the ages of de Rolo descendants as we make our way to the annals of Firecracker Alley. (laughter) Go on. Apparently this is the official tour hat of the house of Whitestone. And apparently I'm the first. How it's not covered in dust or decay, I have no idea. Does it fit well? I feel like it's a bit small. Oh, it's got a little swagger? Yeah, I am pretty tiny these days. I have not been lifting. Like a maid cafe? I like the Derby analogy. That's what I was going for. All I aim for in life. (whispers) The guy that owned him. Wow. (laughter) Been out for a week. Show 'em the dice on the back That's the house voice. When we go home, it's all that. Yeah. That's what we call the Bailey switch. Got home and it was like, fuck. The old gnome diabetes! Yeah, either that or it's like a pub crawl through Whitestone, one or the other. It's all right, it's all right, it's all part of the tour. No, it's all right. Oh man. It's okay. This is Firecracker Alley. All right. These my people. Luck. As you can see, Firecracker Alley was constructed after the revolt of the Haybales of 1874... 39. So how do you feel your tour has gone so far? Are you feeling educated, enthused? Hey Percy, I feel like we should end with, like, a big bang. Like, you know, like, the goods of Whitestone. Really? We're not loading it ourselves? I am a self-made man. I would like to try. That's gonna be negative something-- (laughter) Not going to need it. Seven. Five plus two. Was that the Sun Tree? I'm so sorry. I could go stick it up and cover it with tape and stuff. Okay. I take off running. (laughter) I'm a hundred yards away. Shouldn't he have to roll to see if he shoots me? From 300 yards away, I yell, (muffled) it is not the Sun Tree! (laughter) Yeah. (panting) I heard shots. What's the problem? (whines, groans) Mine. (laughter) Do we want to show them the sphere? Really? That's the craziest thing in this town. Oh. You know, I do know how to write a few letters now. Well, let's not get carried away. Fine. Ain't that the truth. Get it. (laughing) Kill him, Pike! Kill the bearer of bad news. Is it made of lace? Percy. The string's leaving a mark in my chin and cheeks. I feel like now is a good time to put the hat back in its place of holding. Will you guide me to the hallowed area from whence it came? It itches, and I feel deadening of the skin in this U-shape. Nope. It's staying on. I just wanted to know if you wanted it back. Cool. Will do. (laughter) That's heavy. What? I did. Pike, you look me in the eye. She's telling the truth. (laughter) Heavy is the head that wears the crown. (laughter) I'm gonna get you for this. Yeah, what about a second opinion? Like one time it was really burning when I was peeing, and the guy's like, oh, eat this and it'll be fine, and I was like, mm, I'm gonna get a second opinion. Yeah, it actually turned out to be true. But what if he thinks he's telling the truth? This fucking hat is magic! (laughter) Scholars maintain... I thought it was pride. Like I said, greed. Ooh. Ooh! That's a good thought. We kill all of them. No. I mean, do you want to go see another cleric and see if you even need to exercise or not? Avarice. What if it goes out of her and into Pike? Yeah, what does it do? Do you turn into a crazy beast? Like, do you get tentacles? That's not really that bad. Maybe we're approaching this the wrong way. Do it. Do it. You look good. Why not? We really don't wanna walk? It's so lovely out. Danger is at an all-time low. It's like, I'm cool with shapes, but. Yeah, x-ray her! Well, you don't even know. Give it a try. Yeah. Oh, shut up, man, don't fucking do that shit. (laughter) You don't chew on your own toenails or anything? Yeah, it's your show. You've done this before. And it's always gone right. What happened the time it didn't? Oh, shit. Cool. I'm encouraged. Are there any elements needed for this? Water, fire? Right, you did say that. We gotta find a priest. Really? Can I attune to my blood axe instead of the thrower before I go to sleep? Thank you. Give him a high-five. (laughter) Yeah, please, I wanna go with Pike. (snoring) Are you wearing your armor? There are several options, I think. I would like to stay near Pike if I can. Yeah, as long as I'm out of the way of the ritual. Just near Pike. Come on. (laughter) I just have spoken Giant, that's it. 20. (laughs) That happens a lot for you. Is it surrounding Pike or is it just next to Pike? What did you do? Doesn't seem to have affected it. Gonna find out what this thing is, get up close and personal. I would like to Rage. Just charge right at the thing that was towering over my buddy Pike. All eyes on me. I swing at it. The first one regular. 28. We'll see what happens now. 24 points of damage. Necrotic, four. Nice. It screamed in pain from the impact. So the second one, can I make it-- we don't know how high this thing is. Can I do a Great Weapon Master for the second one? Okay. Minus five. That's gonna miss. That's 18. Oh, really? 18 hit? Okay. Shit. 36. 36 points of damage. Nope. Sorry, I haven't used the blood axe in a while. 39 points of damage. Three points of necrotic. I know. That's why I wanted the blood axe back. Missed it. Okay, that's it. No bonus action. No. Do I get an opportunity? Can I make it Reckless? Okay, that's fair enough. Shit, I picked it up. I think it was a seven. So 23. Okay. That's a 12 again. 26. C'mon, Trink. (whispers) What is this thing? I don't think we've seen that before. Okay. Sorry. You're just losing money left and right. Doty got a natural 20. Come on, buddy. See how the other side lives. With a little bit of Smite. That's not even the crit! Frenzied Rage. Reckless. Great Weapon Master. All up on him. All right. No, 30 to hit. Three plus seven. (sighs) 11. 28 on the first one? No. 38 on the first one, because of Great Weapon Master. 27. Minus five. Okay. Ten, 24, 34, 38. Four points necrotic. 38. Third one-- 30 minus five. 25. 10, 24, 26, 36. Nice. Advantage against me, too. 17 is my AC. With advantage it misses me? Bad show, mate. The gnomes aren't doing anything? (whispers) What if they did all of this to get us away from Whitestone? Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Really? That's fucking amazing. Are you serious? How big can the sphere get? You can carry him to the cliff! Is Ogden the one in the sphere? He's so lively all of a sudden. Does his fear grant advantage? That's going to be the most gnarly drop-off ever. Don't rush it. Don't rush it. Don't one of you people have the touch? We're not killing anything? Holy shit! You dropped a grenade, man. (laughing) Yeah, you fucking son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! "Oh, he missed you with advantage? Yeah! He misses you! What's his AC? 12? He misses you!" Were you even writing down damage? "I wrote down numbers!" Yes. Good investigate.
