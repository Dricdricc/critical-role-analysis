We can get H. Jon Benjamin on this show, right? False start, Redskins! Oh god. Oh no. (yelling) Lose! Lose! Delete that shit! It's every month, right? You can't toggle it, so it's something that keeps happening? Yes. Yeah! Or you pooped your pants. I know. I'm sorry. Don't read into it. Yeah, the boats were-- Oh, gosh. Our ship is way better than you guys'. Well, that's why you're on the boat. Yeah, did you think it was for another reason? Bow up! Literally 12. How's the light in here, by the way? Okay. Is there water running to the left or the right? Does it look like it picks up current on either side? Oh, that's a fucking two. That's four. Yeah. Water! Anyone have a preference? We're heading east right? Yeah, I think that's a good idea. It's like a steering wheel! Can you swim? Can you swim, Nott? Oh my god, please. Barefoot ski. That's the best! There are limits! What is math? Yeah, that's good. Uh oh. Nobody. 15. Oh god, I'm first? Yeah, right, okay. Jesus. Do I have a clear line of sight to Nott and octopus fuck? Okay. I won't hit Caleb, right? As I'm looking, is it Nott and then octopus behind it, or is it enveloping him so I can't-- All right. I'm going to send an Eldritch Blast towards the octopus. SAM, ASHLEY, and That's a 21 to hit. That is 1d10. That is eight points of damage. Yes. Actually, with my bonus action, can I cast Hex on umbrella fuck? Yeah. Woo! That's 1d-- That's right. That's on the next thing, right. Copy that. Can it have disadvantage on strength checks? I never said that before. I got to remember. Shit! That definitely hit. (muffled yelling) Ow. No. It's like getting punched with a motorcycle helmet on. (strained) I feel like that was personal. (impacts) Sick, good turn. I am definitely woozy. Thanks. You heard a (yelp) (impact). I'm going to cast Armor of Agathys on myself. Hex is still maintained on that bastard, right? So I can roll 1d6. Or do I, for the-- I cast Hex on the one that was on Nott. Oh shit, right. The boat goes (bobbing in water). Sail! You did a-- Got to go! I'm at the front of ours. Forget that. I get to reroll. That's a natural one. (cheering) Yeah. I think we just need to get closer. I remember they said they threw an explosive behind them and dropped even more, so this won't be the first rock slide. Well, let's get in there. Wait, we're in the spiral staircase and it goes-- We can't see around the bend to how far down it goes, right? Is it an open spiral staircase or just a wall? We can only see as far up as the curves go in either direction. Unless it lets people know when something crosses in front of it. We're going to head downwards. Yeah, please. I'm right in the middle. Where do you want to be? That's cocked as hell. Why are you cupping the balls under your mouth? Ah! I'm running! Yeah, just things to shoot you in the fucking legs. Is that triangular piece of stone raised off the floor? How big is it? If we're just coming into the area, which edge is pointing towards us? The flat or the point? From your brief life. (whistling) Going to have to get back to you. Perception, intimidation, investigation. 21. Oh, shit. So I don't know why I know this. Yeah. It feels like the triangle is down here. Is anyone on the platform? Fuck it, I'll stand up on the platform. Can I look down into that black hole in the center of it? I have darkvision. Oh, yeah, I'll take the torch. I will put my finger in the hole, actually. I don't know how big the hole is, but I want to feel if there are any grooves on the inside or any sort of indentations. I put my little pinkie in it. Solid walls? Well, it's short. There anything around here that looks like a staff or a pole or rod? The floor around this triangle shape, it's flush in the ground, right? There's no circle around the triangle platform? So the ground's not going to move. Maybe the ceiling has to move. Right. We're not going to be able to turn the floor. Caleb, do you have anything to draw these symbols? Oh, yeah! Jester, please, both of you, yeah. Just to get a rendition of the ceiling in relation to the ground. I think maybe we need to see where those stairs go up. Wait. You're going to wait until she disarms the-- Redemption is fucking painful. You want a toe? I can get you a toe. Ten feet ahead is fine. Yeah, we start heading up with Frumpkin ten feet in front. Everybody. Is there any sort of door at the top of the stairs that leads into this chamber, or is it just open? I'm walking in. Lifeless No. Let's see what's on the other side of the room first. Cool. I start walking towards the other side of the room. The little metallic glimmer that we saw. Can we see? About a half inch in diameter, would you call it? These are trash urns? Can I try and move some of the rubble off of the bronze rod? Okay. I think that's a 15. Does it wobble? Does it make any noise? If I swing it harder, does it? 17. I got a question. You said ten minutes on the boat as we were moving forward, ten minutes for him to cast detect magic, and another ten minutes for detect magic to run out, so it's been about a half an hour? Okay, great. So my Armor of Agathys is still up? So can I bonus-action Hex the glob-- the wispy thing right next to me? Nice. Great. Can I take swipe at it with the Wastehunter Blade? Wastehunter. That is 15 to hit. Wow! Can I use all of my 30 foot walking speed to run towards the door there where we came out of. That is the plan here. It hits. And it take ten points of cold damage. Beautiful. I've got that gold rod, by the way. I'm getting the fuck out of here. Which means you roll with advantage, but they get advantage on you. Plus half your barbarian level? Nice, dude, nice. Ugh, it's in my eyebrows! TheMostJost! No, I don't think so either. They're fucking ceramic pottery pieces. We should rest right now. We're still resting. Are the eye holes about the size of gold coins? I'll take two gold coins and put them in both of the eyes on one of the faces. I'll do that to the other two eyes in the other face. Was not anticipating that. He always gets his due. That's an eight. Yep. Me too. Are things moving? Yeah. There's a bunch of old clothes. It smells awful down here. I haven't really looked. I still got this damn bronze rod with me, too, so I got to find my way out of here. Okay! Falls in the clothes, I start burning alive. Can I look around, see if there are any weapons or objects? Oh. That's great. Natural 19. That's a 21. Okay. I'll take some of the nice jewelry and stuff like that and the little vial. Are there any other doors or entrances or shoots? You can tell me what it is now. "When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to necrotic damage for one hour." Nice. Cool. Yeah. I'd like to, yeah. Shall we make our way back downstairs to see what this rod does in the little hole? Yeah, we're going to go back downstairs. Oh, yeah. Give him a shot. We're hoping that we'll get it to turn. I refuse your command and I give it to Schmidt willingly. Counter-clockwise. Rocking upstairs? Yeah okay, I'll walk up and I'll grab the rod. It doesn't move. Do we think we need to cast unique spells into those bowls for each of the three schools of magic? Which is what Jester said. I'm trying to figure out, how do you cast necrotic damage on a bowl? You want to Inflict Wounds on one of them? Other two! Or maybe not. Did we pick the form of our killer? I think so. Seven. Number five tonight? Great. Zero speed, or slow speed? So it's zero speed, it doesn't go anywhere? Is this considered a monstrosity? An ooze? There is something in it! 22, 24. It's a big cube of sludge. Novocaine hands? Like ballistic gel? Ladies first. I'm going to use my speed to run on this side of the cube closer to you, as far back against that wall as possible. 30's perfect. Eldritch Blast. At advantage. That's cocked. That natural 19's not bad, though. Great. Ten plus four, that's 14 points of damage. It's a hardy mallow. Yes, it does. No, I thought it was going to stay there! Shit! How many hit points does it have? Bigby's Dirty, Dirty Cat Paw? (sings) It's right next to me now! I'm coming for her. I'm leaving her behind. Last. Is that your first one? Oh, I'm stepping in it. I'll run over, and I'll kneel down next to Jester, and pick up her head and pour a health potion there. Fjord. It's Fjord. Yeah. You all right? Okay. Get up, come on, on your feet. Yup. Anything come out of the middle of that thing? What are the last two? Divination and-- To the bowl. Yeah, let's do that. Jester, lead the way. Yeah, just regular. Six. Wubba lubba "werbage"! Yeah. Beau and I take the bowls. We head out into the hallway. Yeah. We lay all three of them, one, two, three, out in a row. Evo, you first. Pick a bowl. Sure, try it. We'll see what happens. We're waiting. Nott, you want to go cast it on the rod? Let's go. You and me, we'll do it. Or maybe we need to set them on fire. There's fine writing around the square. That's not just a shape. See this writing in here? What do you want? Nope. I got evocation. I got necrotic. Oh my god. I'm going to cast Armor of Agathys on myself again. I cast Armor of Agathys for nothing. Well, I'm wearing it. I'll run over to the door. I'm running over to the door. I'm not crossing the threshold. I just want to see. I got darkvision. We got more magic stuff inside. I know Caleb's meditating, but it's going to get hairy, I bet. Smells a little burnt hair-y. The dome cages are solid steel, or are they bars? Yeah, I'll go with you. Yasha, Molly, want to come in? She's powerful. I have a healing potion if you want one, too. I take a healing potion, and I hand it to Jester. Seven. I go over to one of the cages. I go over to one of the cages, the nearest left one. 14. Oh jeez. Got another urn here full of ash. Anyone want to check the other cages? Make sure it's not the same thing in each? Heading over to Molly, I stop in the middle of the room at that inert circle. Does it look like anything? 21. I feel like this was used to move or deliver people or things. This was a center for transportation. Real bright. (laughter) Is he done yet? Please pull it out. Yeah, pull it off. I'll give you all my health potions in one day. Is it long? Shouldn't we, for good measure, be breaking up these other ceramic--? Oh come on, it's like (light thud). Yeah. Something wicked this way comes. I'm at that other corner. No, we were supposed to get rid of the orb. Yeah, if we want to be a little punk ass bitch about it! We got to take this guy down! Nine.
