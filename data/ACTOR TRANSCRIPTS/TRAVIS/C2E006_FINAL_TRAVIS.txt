Yeah, we do! You hit Randomize Your Character. What is your name? Panalanalam-- Pana-- There are four "N's" in that name. I am Eomita Deephollow, lightfoot halfling fighter. No, no, no! No! Because I'm awesome. You're in big trouble. That bed was not my favorite. Little stiff. You use a pillow, or are you just on the floor? Do you have to pray over your swords or anything this morning? Yeah, well, we were sharing a room one night, and Molly has a ritual. I think it's part of his custom. Yeah, he performs over his swords. No! Stop it! Yeah. I mean, for fear of your life you ran? I understand that sentiment. Trying to find a little respite, a little peace. You're in control of it. You're using it for yourself? I'm tempted. (retching) Nah. I seem to have missed my calling. I know what you're asking. I didn't have any other dreams. It was fairly restful. None I care to speak of. Anything left? We couldn't quite see it at night, that's true. Maybe we should go down. He said he was going to bring the rest, I think, later. Hey, Molly, didn't you say Bryce said it would come later? Jester, we agreed not to put anyone in harm's way in an excessive manner. Did we not? Maybe I thought that was an unspoken thing. I think I'm fine. Fair enough. Actually, I think they'll find us. We go downstairs. A-rating for the city of Los Angeles? You just give us all diabetes, that's great. Coconut shrimp. Did you just out-talk Jester? Yeah. No, I knew where you were going with it, though. How do we ring the dinner bells, is what you're saying. How do we get them to come to us? Well, they done took it all, I think. Why more so now? Well, they took all the Luby's Cafeteria with them, so I don't think they're going to be hungry for a bit. Then we would need to roast some meats. Who? Yeah. He was hungry all of a sudden? You thinking some of them gnolls had some fiendish qualities, perhaps? Right, shit. I forgot all about that. I have some weird dreams. What did you have in mind? Other nights. MARISHA and Oh, nothing, I got shit in my teeth. Yeah, fine. Did you have a plan? Did you want to do something to wrangle them-- Oh, sorry. Well, maybe we'll follow them to the Barn Broad. Broad Barn. I was fucking with you. Yeah, that's all right. Seems some people handle pressure better than others. He doesn't seem like the handling type. We couldn't help but overhear that you were asking for some aid. How long were you thinking you might need these replacements? Well, I think I speak for all of us, we're certainly up to the task for a bit. Well, maybe for a little less than a bit. Can I ask, are there any other threats to this town, besides those gnolls? Things that come on legs and with weapons, I mean. Why do both of you know that? Do you know what area they might have gone to? More of a pamphlet, actually. Advance? Hey, Caleb? Was that a character-DM inside joke? Caleb. In my personal holdings-- I don't really remember putting this there-- but apparently I have five sticks of incense that I have no intention of using. Will that do you any good? I think it was part of a thing. I don't know. It's D&D Beyond. I don't know. I think so, yes. Changed your day, didn't it? Everything's coming up flowers now. Don't mention it. As he walks away, I'm like Ow! (laughter) Only you would put poop in a jar, Jester. Yeah! Insecticide. Pesticide. Herbicide. Yeah, but you ever chugged a bunch of insecticide? That's a bad day. It's like Visine. Just the juice? It is. With a little whiskey. Like cheeseburger in a shot glass. What do you need to do for the rest of the day, Caleb? I think if we were a little spread it would help. Well, I would follow the direction they left last night. See if we can find a trail. Yeah, you just stay behind Caleb. You'll be fine. Yeah. You know, I love that idea. Small thing, though. Time, again, is of the essence. Right. Dry aged. Really get a good hickory chip under them. Problem is, people might be dying in the meantime. So if we could find a more expedient solution? Beau had an idea! Get them, Beau! You tell her-- Beau had a fantastic observation. If we happen to see one of those beasts of burden on our way out tracking, maybe we could wrangle one up and use it as a bait. To bring people back. I think you're right. Extra horse. We need the cart. I think we'd be making a best guess at this point. My best hope is to find out where they are. What it looks like where they're staying, and if we can, without confrontation, get some survivors out of there. That would be ideal. I'm just putting it out there maybe survivors before ears. I thought you said you weren't a tactician, look at you! Caleb's plan! Let's do it! C-man? I thought I was the seaman? Fucking get your titles right. Come on, brother, you know you want to! I'm a proud son of a bitch! Do we see any crownsguard around? In the street. I'd just like to find one, if I could. Howdy! Sorry to bother, but we've been commissioned by Bryce to make a little expedition to go after those gnolls and we're going to need an extra steed if the Crownsguard has one. Where would those be? Are you concerned about the people that live in this town? Clock's ticking on their lives and you want me to go get a steed from another stable instead of saving their lives? I sure would hate to have to report this to Bryce. I think they'd be pretty upset about it. 13. Your name? Reggie. I'm disappointed, Reggie. I don't know what else to say. Let's go. (laughter) Fuck yeah. Now! Very nice! We make our way over to where we left our other horse and cart. I don't know why, I thought you were going to say they left behind poop. If that's the direction you saw them head off in, check it out. Yeah, that is bad news. Are the carts all heading in the same direction or would they split up? Tall grass on these rolling hills? Picked by beasts or-- The grass, is it dead or vibrant green? Is it still the morning hour or about midday? High noon? Oh no! Don't do it! Oh no! (nervous laughter) It was right there! Mm-hmm. Right. King of the world! Yes. By foot is how we should proceed. No. Would you want to be the one person that got attacked with the horses by yourself? Yeah, I didn't think so. We stick together. Yep. Now I'm ready to die. (laughter) That would give away our stealthy approach. Holy shit. No rocks around, right? No stones or boulders in the field? I was trying to get it in the depression of a rolling hill and just-- We haven't seen anything yet. Kill the horses? Oh, to use as-- that's right, we could. Let's find out what we see first, and then we'll decide. Everybody fan out in a firing line, just one straight line-- Just within eye distance, right? But keep a line. Keep in line. We're going to move towards the cart. We're going to use the tall grass. Yeah. I'm open to it, if you have any. Yeah, let's do that. People's lives. Urgency. Clock. Time. All that stuff. We're all even moving forward. I don't mind being on an end. How about that? You want to be in the middle? 15. Can we see how many entrances there are to this mine yard? I could make a distraction. Nott, Beau, are y'all fast, quick, and quiet? Who else? There's three of them, right? All right. About how far from the edge of the grass, where we are, to them? Can I use Minor Illusion to create a plump little bunny and have it hop out of the grass? But its front leg looks a little lame. Now! I did. Would you like to go? I don't want to, like, make y'all alarmed or anything, but that was kind of fucking efficient. Hands are sweaty? You're right. Quick perimeter check to see if we alerted anything, anything's looking at us. Natural 19. Move to the cart, quick check of anything left behind, clues. There's no bodies, just blood spatter. Oh. We've got to figure out where we're going first. Do it. You're a lot stronger than you look. Yeah, boy, sure did. You're anxious to go. You want to go first? Frumpkin is still just a sweet little bird, so I thought maybe a little quick flight in-- Oh! Oh, smash! Canary in a gnoll mine. I don't know if that's something Frumpkin can do, unless, Nott, you just wanna go in there and go kamikaze. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, yes! We get her hammered, and she's the most fucking badass. Oh no. My only concern is if we draw them out, there could be more than us, right? I just want to get a quick peek, if we can. You wouldn't mind? Consonants are gone! That, my lads, was a dragon. Eldritch Blast on the other one. Yeah, I rolled the first one, which was a 24, but with advantage. That's less, so 24. Oh yeah, I'm sorry. 24 for the first roll. Oh balls, that's-- Eldritch Blast. Oh, that is a 12. Sorry, my bad. Old habits, they die hard. Nine points of damage. Oh, shit. 14. Four points. Damn, you broke its ribs to get to its organs. What happened? How'd they find you? Right. I will keep an eye down the tunnel that they came from while they pillage. Casks. Well, what've we got, are we happy? Are you going to carry the sledgehammer? Not for you, Beast Mode. Yeah, I'll take it. I'll tuck the rod into my belt. You can? Maybe we view this an opportunity to grow and we look for those now. Great. Yeah. Anything that looks out of the ordinary, out of place. On the wall, on the floors-- Are you still shithoused? Are you fucking hammered still? Okay, she needs another shot. Yeah. I know the feeling. Do you want to check air current temperature? Nothing? Anything? Temperature equal on both sides? You know what could be really handy in this situation is some of that fancy fucking thread of yours. Yeah, I don't mind commiting to one of these tunnels, I just want to make sure nothing comes behind us or comes up from the other way. Because you're hammered. Yes! You sussed it out. 15. Don't make a sound. How many total? I don't like seven on eight. I am not a fan. Good thing we're metal. I mean, I hate it, but-- Plus we're in a mine. There's a big column that's in between them, right? Is it a column or a stalagmite? Do you want to throw the rod at the column? There's another path down. Behind them, and make them turn away from us. Because we're in a fatal funnel up here at the top. I genuinely feel like we should go the other way. There's a whole other path. No? Do you know? Can I use this planning moment to cast Armor of Agathys on myself? Spectral frost collects from the air on my armor. I didn't give myself enough cold damage. If we need to close it off, light the tip of that little wick and throw it. What kind of a check was it? I'm ready. Can you point to one of them that is not undead? Just looks like a regular gnoll, or I can just pick one. Great. Did you aim at that one? Okay, I'll take that far one. Can I focus and summon my falchion into my hand? Can I use my bonus action to cast Hex at that right gnoll? Can I reach back and fire Eldritch Blast into it? 16. Six plus four, ten, 1d6, 15 points of damage. Can I use my distance to move over here, if I may? Am I in your line of sight, Jester? Does anybody need that? You do have 1,000 ball bearings, I remember that. We had money. She bought a lot of fucking ball bearings. Hello! Yes. Four. Oh, the gnolls are next. I'm at four. Fucking dope! "Aw, no." Damn. (sings tune to "Single Ladies.") (singing) If you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it. That will hit. Okay. It will take ten points of cold damage in return. That's it. Oh, it is my turn! Can I use my bonus action to move my Hex from my defeated foe to my new foe right in front of me? Yeah, and can I whip my falchion around and upstrike, just try and cut right through him? (singing) I whip my falchion back and forth. Oh, good! Can I say two-handed? I've got to get in the habit of saying it. 1d10. That's a ten! Four-- that's 14 points of damage plus a d6, that's 15 points of damage. Mm-hmm! You fucked with the wrong one, son. That does. Well, hot damn! With a flourish. Fuck that! Oh, that hits. (as Grog) Sorry. Toll the Dead is the bomb! No, it doesn't hit! Thankfully. I'd like to, as well. 21. 11 points. Can we cheers swords? TALIESIN and What's that-- kerning? Curling. You made it prone; it's harder to hit that way! I'm trying! I would like to move up my 30 feet of speed. 13. Can I use my bonus action to move my Hex to the laughing gnoll on the ground? I'll cast Eldritch Blast at it. Oh. That's right. Saving throw? This first one is a 19. The second one is 18. I'll remember that. These spell rules. 14. Yes. Oh, sorry, plus six. That's even higher, so 14. The attack has to hit for Hex to work, right? I apologize. Yep, that shit just hangs out in there. The proned-out gnoll is just making it through. Slap that bitch! Get your hands dirty. One point of damage? All of us? Are you still intoxicated? Or has that shit worn off with some activity? Nope. Oh shit. There was no question. Jester, could you give me a heal a little bit? I took a little bit of a beating. We have the silver thread up top, right? Oh, it took a few minutes, didn't it? I think it's in front of us. A short rest doesn't get us spells back, does it? I'd like to volunteer that perhaps we move forward until we can see whether there are any living people that we can help and we make a decision then. That went far better than the village, but also that big armored bastard wasn't there. The booze? Yep. We got to go. Can't fuck around with mama deaths. (singing) We fucked up the gnolls, fucked up the gnolls. Oh, nice!
