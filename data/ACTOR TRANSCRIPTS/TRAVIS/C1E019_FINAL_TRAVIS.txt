I heard I rolled really well in the beginning of this. Shit. I've been watching in the car. I can, too. I've got my belt of dwarven darkvision. Are you offering him that jewel, or did we ditch that idea? Yeah, roll it out like a tennis ball for a dog. You can Hold Monster? Does he qualify as a monster? I'm not squishy, I go with them. It's true. We're standing in front of a dragon! Oh, pour it on, why don't you? (laughter) What is it with you and your 20s? 19. On your initiative?! You break out the trail mix. That is a record. I don't think we've ever had a negative initiative. Nine? Very wise. I missed something. I got to break it, right? Rage? I look over my shoulder, terrified, at the other one that's scared, and I say, repeat after me, lads. I would like to rage. I want to kill a dragon like my friend Pike did. (battle cry) I would like to run over that direction. I rage-ran. Can I attack? So I can't see beyond it? 13? You sexy tailed bastard. Three plus the two, so that's five. Oh, gotcha. Seven. Yeah. Plus four. 19. 26. 38. That's already there. You're already there. What? Cast what? Is he going to do the twirls? How many times can it choose to do that?! Percy, use your badass motherfucker feat to have it work. Yeah, going deep. What were their names? Ace and Base? SAM and Roll it twice and you get the lower number. Yeah, it's only got plus 40. It's a pretty shrimpy hit. I need to get a wand. (singing) Shake it off. Drop some stank on that dragon. Look at the poker face on that DM. Giving up nothing. Giving up nothing! (laughs) Derek. It's Gary. I would like to race back from whence I came to attack his right flank, if I could. Also, I have darkvision up to 60 feet. I'd like to take my Firebrand Warhammer and activate it. Ignite it. Oh, beautiful, yeah. It's like a torch, which means I can see even better. I'd like to go into a frenzied rage and start swinging away. 19. Beautiful. 25. And 23. d10? Holy shit. Ah! Three d10s? You threw a bunch of numbers at me. 19. Do I do that three times? Oh, wow. 19, and that's 12. 12 and then, help me numbers, that's-- Yes! d12. We got you. 19. LAURA and No, that's five. I don't like the way he said that. Oh, look at that. It's adorable. Oh, you actually care about us that much? He has one more. You mean that hamster, right? Come on, live a little. Well, that's all right. No, not cool! Oh, I'm right fucking there! I was going to move! Yes! 21. More Percy goodness. 18. So hot for you right now. I race over to Scanlan and I pour a level-3 healing potion into Scanlan's mouth. Yes. This is my friend of the lady favors. I need him! Can I do anything else after I've poured it into his-- can I do anything else? Can I throw him the fuck away from the dragon? Pick him up and chuck him towards Lyra? And I won't throw. I'll slide him on the icy floor towards Lyra. Okay. Natural 20. (cheering) And I just turn around and give it the eyebrow of you're-fucking-dead. Okay. 14. 29. 45. Did I best you on math? It's a dark day when Grog beats Vex on math. 18. Halved, because I'm raging. Do that thing. Get up, Gary, you piece of shit! Is it fire, and it's a frost dragon? Nine? Oh, great. 18. Oh, he's reaching for shit. He duplicates himself into another dragon. Now you're all dead. Oh no, the ale's gone! Natural 20! And the room gets quiet. That giant is definitely against us? You questioned at the wrong time. I charge Gary and hack away. (laughs) What do I do, again? What is this shit? This thing plus five. 16. No, attack bonus. I know. Jesus! It's like I've never done this before. 24. 16 plus nine? Oh, it's 25. 28. And 20. (quietly) What is this, 1d10 plus five? Oh, that's ten. 18. 18? Oh. 24 on the first one. Sorry, new math. 13 plus-- 17 on the second one. 12, plus-- 15 on the third one. 27. 39. 48. 1d6. 53. You bad bitch! Yes, dude. Way not to be dead. I need my whoring partner. Nuke him. Nuke the bastard. I do. Do it for Percy. Do it for Pike. I run over to Percy and pour a healing potion in his mouth, and I don't "in him." (laughter) Oh! (laughter) Can I go and loot the giant that's not frozen? Two rolls. We're not shoving it in there? Are we cutting it in half? We have a shitload of dragon teeth left over. He was a white dragon! No, it was a white dragon, we have 37 left over. One more. Oh, I looted the giant. Can I loot the bloody giant? I would like to perception check the leather hat. 16! It's a fancy leather hat. It's mine. Dibs! What? He can already disappear. Take it! Do we get to work with another leader next time? Grundle? Oh, a history check? Four. He's a person. We have 12 teeth left. No, she misspoke. Aye. Scanlan, should we go and make sure that your wounds are completely healed? What were you thinking? Vox Machina does not flee. We are sure they will.
