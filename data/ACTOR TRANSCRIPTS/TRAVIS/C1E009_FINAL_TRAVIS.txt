Every Sunday morning. Don't say anything! Do you have a lisp in that show? What? Yeah! What? Everybody needs a nap. I like chips. Percy, you can make that. Yeah, roll the shit out of that. It's a classic movie moment. Who hits Scanlan? Great way to leave a party. Oh, shit.... When it's out of the blue like that it's always bad. Yeah, how could you? (high-pitched) Ooh! Oh snap! I'll die once I finally come back. At least I don't have to roll for intelligence. Put it on him, Percy, let's go. Get on it! I'll bring him one. Grog's been hitting the peace pipe. Against magic? Oh. How many points? I can take it. (whispering) Hey, Matt. How much damage did I take? Cool. (painful roaring) Yes! I mean... Get the hell out of there (laughs) Wow. (all laugh) Heck yeah. Thank you, thank you. (gasps) Oh shit! (screams in terror) So good. Soulmates. Are you still invisible? With his feet? Does he have a goofy run? Did you go, "Fireball!" as you do it? Hadouken! Oh, peace out! Mind gobbler. What? Well, am I still chained up to the cart? Excuse me, giant rock thing. Could you perhaps get me out of this shit? I can't tell yet. I'm still in this wonderful therapeutic chair. Are they bars? But it's a wooden cart? Is it a wooden cart? Or just smash the cart. Thank you. Was there just one? (groans in relief) Oh my god! 25. I got a 25, does that not help? (groans in relief) And nobody ever drank that? ORION AND And can I ask Pike to heal me, because I look like a game of tic-tac-toe? Oh, no, don't think of me, please. I've only been fucking missing for two weeks. No, totally was. It was amazing what you did. Could you do it again? (whispers) Can you fucking heal me, please? Can you please heal me? Could you do that cheer where I feel a lot better after you do it? Thank you, Kima. It's been interesting. Now? Just talk loudly. Speak! You want me to distract her? I'll distract her! I'll distract Kima. Scanlan, do not drop the mack. (squealing) Ooh, inside-the-group check! I love it! The whisper! The first whisper! Whisper on camera. He used to do this all the time. When shit goes down and all of us can't know, he whispers. And he sticks his tongue in your ear a little bit. What was that shit about now I'm manly? What did I say? You can't keep it in for two seconds. Not that I blame you! My god! Yeah, let's camp. Could you un-Polymorph your tripod, for god's sake? Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome-- [music] Yeah, we follow. I was like, "oh shit." I walk over to Lady Kima and I say, "How's that that greatsword been treating you?" Got it! Got it. We're good. Yeah, that's what they call it in some countries. (all laugh) I'm up to full, yeah. Yeah, don't you fix these. Wait, what happened to your foot? Oh my god! (laughs) That looks awful. Really awful. You know, we could just take care of the whole thing right now, if you want. No? Rash? ...all right. It does smell amazing, actually. Are our feet leaving footprints? Son of a bitch! Dust of Tracelessness everywhere! (all laugh) I love it. Do you still want more of them? I go Hong Kong Phooey on the wall of crystals with my axe and I just (snarling). I don't, but I have a fancy robe. And I put it in there and I bundle it up. What? I need your help. I would like to move the boulder. It's in the path? 26? On the strength check? (singing) Push it, push it real good. I roll over on my stomach and I ask Trinket to step on my back. I roll over and have Trinket step on my back. (groans in relief) Thank god. If this is a tomb, I'm going to be so pissed at the two of you. Nah, it's fine. They're dead. That name sounds familiar, though. Do you have to be able to use magic to use it? Oh! What was it? One! We have a natural one Remove Curse? I could try it, hold on. Nope. Let's leave the golden armor alone. Oh no. Don't make him laugh. Do you need me to create a curtain for you to change behind? Yeah, you two roll. Go for it. (laughing) Sibling justice. (laughing) It's mine, it's mine. Right. Do you know if there's anything in the water? Six. Really, should I go get it? Me! I'm actually a really good swimmer. I run to the water, as well, and I fucking cannonball. (all laugh) One and a half inches? Me, too. (all laugh) Ask him if the bridge is booby-trapped. Yeah, I'm shivering. (gulps) I take a big breath and swim down to where the giant shark is. Can I also perception check? This is like one out of every five games that I get to. 12. Plus zero. Boats! Should we ask Clarota if the bridge is safe to travel? Pull? Oh, fuck, yes, we have an underwater breathing kit, that we bought at the store. There's two of them. I wrote, "two underwater breathing," and didn't write what it was. Okay, so we swim up to the top and we come back to the shore and you're just in the water still. "Yes?" It looks like some kind of boat. My perception is shit. Absolutely. I start pushing the boat back in the water and I jump in and I start jumping up and down. Loot the cave first, and then the island. Right, cave first. Yeah. Let's get all up in that bad boy. There's treasure. Nope. I'm thinking it'll be a quick trip. Yep. Oh, Jesus. Six. We're killing something? I come running in. Has anybody run to the back of the cave yet? I come running in. No killing. Smart. Yes. Yeah, do that. That would be amazing. The kid is very smart. Wait, what? I found one. Handling or courting? (all laugh) What is this? This is metal. Amazing. Overlord overlord.
