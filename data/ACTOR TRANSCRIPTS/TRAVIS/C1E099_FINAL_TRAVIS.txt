You did the math wrong there. Oh no, that's right. Because he's a traitorous bitch. Enter the Meat Man. Are you going to play competitive Gears of War? I went to college there. Please be a turd. What is it? Aw! Wow, twinsies. You just go down by yourself, right? Tary, can you tinker up some Raid real quick? We need bait. (sings) -- and you rattle my brain. TRAVIS and I do! Yep! Yep, do you want some? You got it. I pull out the jug and I yell, "Poison!" Did you want to drink it? No. It's really hardcore, if you do. No, we've got an orc, like, calf, and a foot, and it looks like a skull, covered in like, pasta sauce. I just made this poison for, like, no fucking reason? (laughter) Are we just above the hole? I take initiative and I take the orc leg, dunk it in the poison, toss it, then I take the last-- this is the last orc piece in the bag-- I dunno. No, no. The ox is way gone, that poor bastard. Two little orc parts, now poisoned and... Fucking Taliesin Jaffe. What are you talking about? Just let Pike off the leash. Yeah, not too bad, Vasquez. Yeah, I think we did it. Let's get the fuck out of here. Chicken and biscuits. Is Camilla still playing music? That's some Moriarty shit right there. Let's do this. Everyone dies. Everybody. Let's light it up. We are a little beat up and stuff. Oh, really, you're going to leave us down here? Fucking high-born piece of shit? Gross, we're all in the same room. Is this how we're supposed to eat in the house of Darrington, Tary? Can't you pop a crystal off of that helmet of yours and make a banquet? Not the same thing. Only one way to find out. Hold on. Be my guest. Nope. Nope. Baked beans and sausages and-- ! No. You're going to use it now? Yeah. I have a question. Is there any more stew? My stomach is making noises, I'm so hungry. What about the bakery? We're just feeling hangry as shit. All right. We'll get brunch back in Whitestone, right, and get out of here? Let's go, then. You don't say one word. No, you shut up. Well, say your goodbyes. Do we assume the form of clouds? Like, a judo strike? Maybe he'll kill us and we don't have to shop anymore. Yeah! People call him Chode. What kind of problems? Are you fucking shitting me?! Yeah, we know him. What? Really? Is this the Meat Man we know? He's not the Meat Man that we know. No, real good. Real good thing. A ring? What does it do? Chode. Hold on, Pike had a question. Aes Adon. I don't think it's Scanlan. What? Oh god! Jesus! Balls! A pyramid? She went to go find information about it, that's not strange. Keyleth, stay on task! I'll kill you! I'm going to kill you! How could you? You! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Oh, two ones! Two ones! What? Yeah. I'll go, too. It has. Yeah. I leave. Yeah. Yeah, I take off my earpiece, too. Percy. Where would someone like him stay in Whitestone? Uh-huh. Lionel. Real strong, are you? Aes. Does he depend on you? How long have you known him? How strong do you think you are? I reach across the table and I just punch him in the face. 24. Nine. Ten, sorry. Yeah. This bar, there's a lot more where that came from. All you can eat, yeah. Rage. Total rage. Are we at a bar? At a table? 14. Are we at a table or the bar? At a table or at the bar? Magnificent. I flip up the table in my hands and I smash it over his head. 25. 12. That's not great. That's a 14. (choking sounds) (choking sounds) I'm going to put it in reverse straight towards the wall. My action. I take my elbow, raise it up and drive it into his ribs. Yeah, that's a 28. Ten. For my second attack, can I throw my head back in a headbutt? Yeah, 23. 11. You got it. Just one roll? 24. What is this? Minus two. Four. Eight, got it. I'm so confused. I've never had another male do that to my body. He shimmied on me. And then he punched me. And then he kicked me in the jellies. I turn around and I leave. (gasping) What? Cat. C-A-T. And I leave. I was told... Mm-hm. Pike? I leave. Did you want to say something? We didn't plan that in any way.
