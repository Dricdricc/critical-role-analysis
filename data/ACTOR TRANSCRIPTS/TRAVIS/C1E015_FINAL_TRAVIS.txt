We need better speakers. What. Wait, Tiberius is the only one that couldn't grow a beard right? The ladies could get some stank beards. Yeah! Yeah, I've seen some nasty she-beards out there. 18? I want to grow a fucking beard. I know it does other things, but with a beard-- I'll take it, we can hold it until somebody else wants it. Whoa, whoa, no. Not cool. You can have it. Has Vax come back from his man date? True. Oh yeah! Are we still at Gilmore's? Are there any shady characters making eyes at our goods? Me make a perception check? 15 plus... probably crap. Zero. Oh, all right. On you? You did not. Come on buddy. Do it. Just straight up. Why didn't you wink first? Yeah, no shit. Vax has something he'd like to add. Proud of you right now. Yeah, is there a tavern nearby? Just a quick question. It's the biggest one? I'd like to walk to the Laughing Lamia and knock the doors open and as loud as I can, go, Listen up! I want to know if anyone has seen any goliaths wandering around these parts. Aside from me. Persuasive... yeah, well, maybe there's some dwarves hanging about. I got a four. With the belt. (laughter) I grow a giant pubic mane from the belt. I'd listen to him, he means it. Yeah, yeah! Thug life. That's amazing! No, Killer. That was awesome. I had no idea. That was amazing, Scanlan. Okay. 50% chance. That a 20? Both of them? 60? Double zeroes. Okay, good. Shit. Probably not. Just a guess, though. Allura? If you have an erection for more than 24 hours... Tiberius, can you bamf us to the place? Dope. So let's go. She won't have any interest if you don't talk to her. (sings) Say what you need to say. Everyone introduce yourself. You can call him Percy. Yeah, you look wonderful, Lady Kima. I have it. Oh, I'll get it. I reach in-- What? Yeah, the box, the magic box. I think we can trust them. Yeah, I think we're good. I know, I've never been on one! It only floats a couple feet off the ground, it's not that big of a deal. Brother on the guy, sister on the girl? Oh. I'm bald. I run up behind her and I grab her shoulders to scare her. Did you pee a little? Okay. They are the worst. Five minutes? Yeah. Oh, that's a weird choice then. Weird. Cool choice. Strange, though. Can you make something so that if we fall out of the sky we don't die? Is there a bow on this ship? Like a front, pointy part? Pike and I would like to go to the front of the ship and I would like to stand at the front and put my arms out. And I'm going to shout I'm the goliath of the world! No I did not! (laughter) I rush to the box. I was going to ask you the same thing. What? What? Sweet. Dude, that's pretty. Here, I'll pick you up. Don't do it. Ready? Totally. Yeah. (whisper) Return of the Jedi. Did it. 19. We already got your 20. 19, 19. 15 to ten? Look at Percy. It just explodes in thorns. It's not a fire arrow? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is that also at the front of the ship, is that what that is? That the captain? Oh, you are shitting me! I turn to the group and say, Make sure someone guards the box in case it's a distraction. And then I rage. And I would like to run to the front of the ship where the captain was, as far as I can-- Oh, the captain's there? I will run to the front crystal. If I can get there. It's 40 feet is how far I can go. Son of a bitch. Okay. I wanted to tie myself to something, though. Is there a railing on the side of the ship at all? Okay, I have a hundred feet of chain. Can I take the chain out of the bag of holding, wrap it around my wrist, and wrap it around the railing, and then that'll be all I do. Can I do that? Yeah, I'll do that. (laughs) You're going to kill a bunny. That is an Acme cartoon waiting to happen. Stick with the bunny, the bunny's good. That was slick. Why has the music died?? Bad wyvern. Bad. Wyvern. Fail, fail. Fail. Bunny go splat, bunny go die. Thumper's toast. You'll hear the guts splat out of it. Confidently. Roll that shit. Buffy. How much? 26? (sings) Shave and a haircut. Yes! Fuck yes! Is he a halfling as well? 24 hours. It's like with Hermione and her protection spell. This guy's still alive in the back, right? Okay. We can't see him. Come on, Jersey, roll that shit. Oh no. It's gone. Seeing the wyvern at my feet, I feel that familiar tremble in my loins and I take my hand out of the chain and I go into a frenzied rage. And I would like to butcher the ever-living fuck out of that mini-dragon. Oh, hold on, kitty. 15 plus eight is-- Oh. 23. 23 again. Natural 20. The third one. 18. Nice, all three. Eight. Yeah. Yeah, I rolled a one. Critical, so is that two of these? 2d12? Oh, awesome, 19. 19. I rolled a 12 plus-- Oh, gotcha. 31. And the last one. 16. Wyvern. Yes. Not a shark? For when this goes in the water. Fail! Fail! That hits. Would that be bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, by any chance? I half on that. Okay, all right. No, he's up. Natural 20. Yeah, I think that's accurate. 21. Hi. Crazy shit, huh? Yeah, come on. We got a flat tire. Do it! Outstanding. Slow jams. Nobody. Nobody's at the front. Yeah, one would do it. That's a lot of numbers. Lot of numbers. I pull myself back up on the ship. I look up and I see that everyone's got that wyvern taken care of, and I turn my gaze back to that little halfling in front of Vex. I'd like to move to him, please. Yes! Okay. 23? Yes! Sorry. 19. Trembling, raging in the face, I reach and I pick him up by the top of his shirt, give him a sniff, and fucking chuck him off the side of the ship. Do I get advantage on strength checks when I'm raging? Advantage on strength checks, strength saving throws? Yes, when I rage. It says strength checks. Okay. (laughs) That's even better, that's a 24. You fucked up! Can we interrogate the last one? I'm good. Yeah. Validation? Oh, it can't fly? Yeah, amazing! The closer! Yeah, fan the fucking hammer. Attacked the wrong ship. We haven't seen any of them come out of that room. And I'll go to the halfling. I would like to pick him up, not chuck him, but pick him up and hold him ever-so-gently over the side and say, My, my, it does seem like a long way down. What the fuck are you doing attacking this ship? 16. 16 on the advantage roll. Let you live? Oh! It was such a hard battle, I'm shaking. You know, my hands are so sweaty, I'm afraid you'll slip if you don't tell me what you were doing attacking this ship. Drop! If you want him, you can catch him. Her. What? The captain said he'd throw him over. Her over. What he's thinking, I'm doing. Oh, really? I pick her up-- Put her back down. If you don't. (falling sound) Is she hurt? Yeah! Great map, man. That shit looks awesome. Only one of us got thrown off the ship, and she could fly. Normally that's me, just right off.
