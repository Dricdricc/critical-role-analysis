That's what we do! DM O'Drien! Why doesn't it wrap around to the back? Pull it down a little bit. Just give it a little tug. There it is. Brad Pitt? Keep going. Thank you, Matt! Thank you. Except there won't be one. 'Cause you're going out of the country. They're going to-- Where are you going, the North Pole? Y'all are dating? (laughter) It looks like Mercer's eating the table. What? Are you pointing at me? Okay, okay. I'll start. Because I single-handedly established peace across Exandria, I found myself bored, in need of action. And so I sought out where the fight would now be. I looked for Scanlan a little bit along the way. I didn't find him. I looked for, like, magical items along the way. I didn't find them. So I went to Vasselheim, which is where the Slayer's Take is. And I think before I left, I wanted to get some personal things, like, done to my body. So I had the bear tattoo that I filleted of off Kevdak, and I had it tanned, and then I got a copy of that tattoo on my back. Because that shit's behind me. Yep. Totes. Much better idea. I also took Kevdak's skull, the top of it, and I had a new cup, a new mug made out of it. With metal bits and stuff, with a handle. I don't understand how, but it looks really great. It's like metal and bone, and I (drinking sounds). That's me. I just choked on a peanut. So, I went to Vasselheim, and I defended my title in the Crucible. Multiple times. Kern the Hammer, he came back with that monk shit. Nope. I forgot. No. Yes. I said yes. I said no. (laughter) I said no. I said no, because I was like, you've got to drink, all the time, and this, and he just wasn't up to snuff. That, and I should not be teaching anyone anything. So then I went to the Slayer's Take, right, in search of big game. And I had fun with that for a while, but it just wasn't quite the same. It wasn't crazy-ass, you know, ancient dragons or nothing. It just wasn't quite up to snuff. But I did have my curiosity about the Deck of Many Things piqued. So, at some point along the way, Vex's warnings ringing in my ears, I found a nice drunk sap to-- Yup. Hey, you! You. You look like a mighty warrior. Do you need another drink? Yeah, I do. I have one. And I pour him a little bit from the keg. Hey, do you have like, a wife, kids, attachments? Anyone that would miss you? I'm going to take that as a no. Cool, hey, look, I don't know if you're interested, but I have, in my possession, something really cool. And I take out the Deck. Do you know what this is? Great! Great! We're in the street, right? Good. Follow me into this alley and it'll be a deal. Just follow me over here. 19 plus one. Well, listen. I am kind of like an evangelical spreader of good news. And I found this. And one time I pulled a card out and I got a magic weapon. It was amazing. And I just figured, like, you look like a guy that would appreciate such a weapon, so-- -- and I open the Deck. I thought maybe you would like to draw a card. Yes. Yep. Sure. Yeah. Just draw it and-- Actually, just hold it and don't tell me what it is. It was a fucking year. Did you not think this was going to happen? (laughter) Lot of problems, lot of drinking, lot of fighting. Ran out of shit. I'm not. He's drawing the card. Could it? I'm not really sure on how this shit works. But I need another card to come out of that Deck. Oh, you raise your hand to pull from the Deck? Thats some bullshit. Ooh. Ooh. No, I don't remember. It was a face card, though. Could you describe to me how you feel right now? Grog. Grog. Grog Strongjaw. Maker of kings. Yup. Are you fucking serious? (shouts) Wait! What was your name? Did I get his name? I should just pull all of these right now. (groaning) That is way better. He's double-checking. You know what? Only one person picked that card from the Deck. So it's not really my fault. It was the queen of diamonds, right? Yeah. Clearly, nobody in my group knows what they're talking about. This Deck is a mighty gift! And I put it back in the Bag of Holding. I want to, really bad, but I have an open bar tab. Okay! Lord of the Crossroads? Quadroads? Good deal. That happened. That's all I wanted, really. Just cheer him on, maybe have a little better counterweight for my expectation of the Deck, but now I just want to pull one every day. Nothing but good shit happens! Magic weapon! Fucking Wishes! No. I mean, oh god, why do I have to be so fucking true to my character? I will probably wait to take it back so that I can open it with my good friend, Pike. Because she'll understand that this is an awesome deck. I did, yeah. I was curious about the werewolves. So I went to go see the nymph in the frozen lake. You know, the one that's all about Grog. So I had a conversation with her, and I felt really bad because I wasn't as affectionate as last time, so I gave her this palm-sized ruby that was at the bottom of the bag. Looked really pretty, so I gave it to her. She did. We hit it off. And I asked her if the werewolves were just in the Feywild. Turns out-- Well, I didn't fucking know that. It was in Vasselheim. Yeah! To kill each other. Nope. Yep. ASHLEY -- and we knew both of us were just too powerful-- Two monsters of a feather stay in leather. Just a little. Yep. (laughter) Doody, with a Y. I'm tired now! You ate raw meat with me. You did. Like a champ. What if some shitty 11-year-old kid just runs up and hits it? Oh. Smart thinking. How awful. What'd you kill, in the year that you had off? Boring. Oh he fucking talks! That was amazing! It can't be for anything else. Anything else won't compare. Just change it. Itty-bitty little hole. What? You made a broom? You really have no money left. Is there a pin? I don't wear a shirt, so. Profiteroles? Your money. Jesus. No! (laughter) I'm only wearing the pointy helmet, Percy's ascot, and his glasses. I mean, I always have pants on. (sings) Sailing. TRAVIS, SAM AND Holy crap. Straight to the house of lady fav-- (laughter) Some sandals. We wish to stay. Getting after it! Wasting no time. Wow. Why have we not had fucking Pike do things? Are there any pool aerobics? (laughter) No, I'll join the rest. Nope! (laughter) Oh, you said lift. I did it. (laughter) Well, me especially. Nope. Not doing that shit. Not doing that. (laughter) I'm building a sand castle while they're doing that. Okay. Tary, do you know what I hear they do on beaches? You bury someone up to their head in sand. No, I thought we could bury you. Hold on. And I start doggy digging between my feet. I go into a Rage. Big hole right there. I end my Rage. Get in. Yeah, totally friends. Why didn't you pay for our rooms with all your money? How much? How much do you have left? I start filling up the hole. (laughter) Do you want to build a castle? Fucking A, man. Do you know how to do that? No shit? (laughter) Okay. Four! What did you do? Okay. What did we do wrong the first time? You putting this on me? Probably. Doty, go walk over there. Oh, he listens to me now? Yeah. Wow. Dungeons? With alligators in the moat? Okay. Come on, Gil. Five. I think that was my fault. (laughter) All the way up to the head this time. The giant reflective piece of metal? You're going to cook in that thing. I hand him a seashell. I'm sorry. Where have you been all our campaign? "But they need their skin to live!" Yeah! Yep. She pulled really hard. Jewels? I just want the beads. Little beads and little braids. No jewels. What about you? Everything? Do you want extensions? It is. Do you want other colored hair in there, too? Yeah, why not? Fuck it! Yeah. Not a problem. Are we supposed to tip? Are you there? Yeah. Hell yeah. They don't live for much longer. Yeah, mini-fridge. Hey. Oh. Hi. I feel like I should ask what, but the answer's probably yes? Ah! It's really tight! (yelps) (groans) What in the-- what-- (groans) (sniffs) Ugh. What the fuck? Is this your fucking dog? No! Where am I going to get dogs from? Although I don't think this shit and piss is mine. Yep. Can I let the mastiffs have a couple of licks from the alchemy jug full of beer that I was drinking out of? We're all making our way over to Vax's room. Is that your second Luck? You were fucking naked a second ago. Yeah, totally. That's true, he hasn't said. Well, actually, now that we're home, I would like to try and find Pike once we're in and settled. Cool. Hey. Hey. Oh, sorry. Hey, it's Grog. Huh, what? Hi! Hey. Hey. Hey. So, can I shut the door? So I-- Oh, okay. I shut the door. So, I have a secret. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so. When we beat Thordak, I was rummaging around and all of Emon's treasures were in this one place and everybody was like, "Meh, we want to heal," and I found these little gifts, and one of them was this little itty-bitty deck of cards. I know, right? Now, here's the thing. It was in a really pretty box wooden box with gold all over it. I tried to open it, and it wouldn't, so I smashed it. Like you do. And I took it out. And I drew a card from it, and this magic sword appeared in my hand. Yeah. Do you want to? Yeah. So I also went and I was journeying around. I went to Vasselheim. Now, here's the thing. Vex was like, "No, don't pick one, it's dangerous. Mm." Well, no. She's afraid that it's dangerous, right? Because the sword, it turned to rust, and I got a headache afterwards. Whatever. But I think I didn't handle it right. But I went to Vasselheim, and I had this other guy pick a card. You know? And he picked a card. He got two Wishes. Just like that! And he made himself-- I know! He's the Lord of the Crossroads. Yep. He's rich; he had a servant who appeared out of nowhere. All of a sudden he had fuckin' dope-ass threads. I mean, I feel like we should. I've seen nothing but good things happen. (laughter) Well, I don't know. So it was a magic sword, right? I was going to be able to throw it and it would fight without me. Like it would just fight things that I told it to. No! I tried talking to it and it didn't say anything. We have a history. I know. I have a history of, you know. Nope. Yep. Yeah. Pretty much. I think it's a Deck of Fortunate Things. I think so. I mean, I haven't really looked at it too closely. Do you want to look at it with your knowledge? Yeah. All right. I give her the deck. Really? Oh. Or you make a bad person a king? Really? But we're good people, so good things would happen to us. I know, right? And think about my previous experience. There is nothing bad that has happened in what I've seen so far. I don't know. I mean, like, I kind of want to. I mean, so like. Like bad things. How could it just outright kill you? Well if you die, I can't do a spell. We should flip a coin. Okay. Do you have a coin? Oh, you do? That was lucky. Do you want to? What if all the good ones are gone? Heads, because that's all bad in the heads. But the tail is the booty, so. Yeah, what do you feel like? What do you feel like? One, we pick a card. 20, we don't-- we do pick a card. (laughter) That was a Fraudidean slip. (laughter) Okay. We should flip for that too. But that was for you, you flipped. And now I flip. It is? I might. (laughter) I've made this promise before. (laughter) Vex. Oh. Ooh. No, your promise was different. You said 'alone' so if I was like really, (distressed noise) I need to, I come to you-- And we pick it. Okay. Deal. Thanks. You're sure you don't want to just, like, slide one out and just take a look at it? Yep. All right, fine. (laughter) All right. Yes. (laughter) Oh god. (gasps, running noises) (shouting) Gnomes! (pants) You don't know them? Yeah, they never came by Wilhand's. Busy. Important. Yeah, you're sweating a lot. Do you want some deodorant? You kind of smell. Yes! Do me next. What have I done? Huh? They're so nice. I feel terrible. As long as you need. Pike's family is our family, really. Could I request one thing? Could I have a hug? Yeah, all of you at once! It's okay. I love it! That's my favorite kind of people. Big pooper! No, we're not. We're here for a long time. We just got done fighting all the things. We're settling here. Kick the cane out, see what happens. Do you need this? Boom! He could. He smells like cheese. Pike, are there any more coming? Got any more of you coming? Like bunnies. Yes! Yeah. You won't regret that choice. I walk into the kitchen. I go, okay. Listen up! I need peanut butter, I need turkey legs, eggs, cheese. (laughter) Chop chop! You won't get sleepy. Trish the Dish. Amazing. They kill the tax man. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Anything you want to see, as long as you've got more of those stories. Thank you. That's what it totally sounded like. You want a proper tour of deez nuts? (laughter) He likes helping people. No, Ogden did a lot of drugs when he was younger. Wait, what? I thought I get them all. Yeah, don't they want all to be on my tour? Oh. Perhaps. Yes. Quite. My history of the city is unrivaled. Thank you. (laughter) Yeah. This is a big tree. Grog is 14.
