Stand in front of this table. Stand in front of this camera. No one can see you over there. Why are you getting totally naked? Stand over here! In front of the table, you dicklord! Yes! Put your butt against this table! Kneel down, Taliesin! And will you hold up that mini? This amazing mini was done by Eric Blumkiss-- I'm sure I'm messing up the name-- from Sweden. It's an incredible Grog mini that's so detailed and amazing, and I had to have it, so I promised our firstborn child to him. The four of them stacked are pretty fucking incredible. How about no. Probably not. Yeah, rap-battle. He does look a little weak, even for his standards. (burps loudly) Yeah. Can't get any worse. What, we're freeing them from a dragon. We are bearers of good tidings. Yeah! Now do we totally trust Tooma and the Ravenites? Do we want to give her all the details or just that we're going to be checking it out for one day more before we ring the dinner bell? Well, if we have an extra day, what does that get us? Ooh. How do we do that? Which I think we do. But I think we need you here, right? We're going to be setting a trap, right? So maybe we make that trap more better? Who's Yenk? What's that? He's like a ram? No. I'm the only one that really appreciates pictures, and I haven't seen it. Say it so confidently. Wait. Is that like this, is it like me? That's really big. I'll draw it full scale! I put my hand on the page. Yeah, I think he's hand-held. Maybe we need like a few Yenks. Everyone can do with a few Yenks. (laughter) Wait! Vax and Scanlan, when you're within, did you see Vorugal in your travels? Do you think you could replicate your path in the daylight? Are we going to go now, or are we going in the morning? All right. Yeah. If we're summoning a few good Yenks, do we have a spot that we want to say stay away from? Oh, on the summoning stones. I've got to go pee. When you call it the stranger-- The way he said that-- You sure did. You don't think Vorugal is going to think that's a midnight snack? Yeah, you. Big white tiger? Oh okay. Oh get on with it, fuckers! (laughter) Oh, that's lucky. Oh, busted. She take it well? Great. Wait! Should we see if we can get Pike first? Yeah, let's get all our ducks in a row. Hey! Hey, buddy! Why are you out of breath? What, why? You just walked through a tree. Why was there a rockslide? Oh! Yeah, I open the front door and I take big handful of the Dust of Tracelessness and I (whack). 14. I just want to see what it is! Hey, pushy! It's a dragon. Yeah, a big white dragon. And you let it know we're here! (chuckles) But hey, we're not, so we need to get some sleep, right? We sleep. Yes. These islands float, right? Only stupid people do that. So two caves? Four caves? Quick question. In all of our time here, when we were scouting before, and when you two jokers were going to go see Tooma, did we see a bunch of animals around? As long as being animals isn't going to make us a mid-day snack, versus being Ravenites. Can we do both animals and the mist? I just want to be able to move faster, but it's all right. Yeah, if I can get next to him. Pipe down! Calm down! Listen, how are we getting down there? Can we hurry this up, please? And Kima is with us? There's also a training room several levels down if you want to go smash some shit. We all die together. Four. Yeah. Got it. We're wind; you're good. Loud. Not nearly enough to move tunnels of earth and rock. We got the house. We got the mansion. That's it. Why would you do that? How do we go get Kima? Wait! Does the stone make any sound or light? Really? Then sure. She can poof from within the mansion. Send the two bitties. And we're going to hide out. I'm still in my mist form. Where is the circle? Oh. Thank you. (laughs) Yeah. That ends well. No. No. On his knees. Or a budget rental center. (laughing) 80 to 100 feet up, right. Can I raise a point, Taliesin? Do you have anything to keep you from falling if he attacks you on that ravine? That's how tall the ravine is. Aren't those going to be obvious? Can you do your detect dragons thing? Larkin, are you ready to help us kill a dragon? Aye. Don't you think dragons are just the biggest dick-fucks ever? Yeah. No. Real simple answer, I think. Yeah, he's a real dead-eye. We have a hard time keeping track of everyone that we hire and fire. Yeah, it's all right. Listen, all you've got to do is smash dragon with us tomorrow, yeah? The white one. Larkin. Holy shit. I even got that. (laughter) You're the last person in this room and on the internet. I got 11. Are we not going to be in the house? Yeah, I'll be in the house. If you pour poison on a blade, do you get poison damage if you hit them with it? Did you merge 8 Mile with-- (whispers) Roll a little better. Focus your chi. Holy shit. A little elevator music playing. Yenk's going to go, "Come on, chum. Let's be friends." Back in the dragon again! 15. Yeah. Wow. Fuck me. Um. What? I'm up? Fuck that. We're all going down. I take the Titanstone Knuckles and I smash them together, and I use the Enlarge, and I will burst out of the mansion in a rage. No, remember it's halved. I'll use that dash to keep moving towards the ice wall, towards you. Maybe two or three squares. That will be my turn. Three years, never worked. We don't know what that does. Only if you're right on him? I'm only two squares away, I think. 17? Oh, well, he's in the air, which is my preference, all around. Can I get up, please? Now we're somewhere. Can I move directly under him as far as I can go? Can I haste or pick my nose to go any further? I will hold until he drops. And two more. That's 8d6. She's speaking Parseltongue. (laughter) Come on, represent us melee-ers! I'm making a mean face, so far. Yeah! 5d8 because it is a fiend! Yeah, come on. For the very few times Kima gets to get shake the dust off. Just from the attack of opportunity? That'll hit. And you said additional 30? Additional 38, so that's halved also. 19? 48 points of damage. There are three giant monsters. Can I go to a frenzied rage and unload on Yenk? Okay. This will be reckless attack. Great weapon master. Because fuck it. Why not? 28 for the first one. Natural 20. (shouting) And 27 for the third. The first one is 15 plus six points of necrotic damage. 21. 25. Nope. That's an 11. It's a six. One. One. Six. Seven. Seven extra points. 28 on the third one. I've got everything you want, big boy. In Yenk-adjacent? I'm doing real good. Did the key break off when you locked it? She made him bend the knee. That'll hit. Hits. I'm going to use my Stone's Endurance on the natural 20, and I'll do retaliation on one of those three hits. d12 plus my constitution modifier. 14, so I reduce that by 14. Great weapon master, reckless. 26? 22. 32. When he jumped up and did the hoof kick down, I'm going to take it and then grab his hooves and wishbone him. (cheering) I look at both of the legs in my hands, and I look at Kima and go, which one's lucky? Yeah. Can I make a quick look down? Do I see any Spire of Conflux? In my rage? Natural one. I'm going to take off running toward Vorugal! I'll dash to get as far as I can. From which potion? Are you kidding me? Every time we have one of these big fights-- We do, but a straight 20 to one flip-flop only happens one time. I think I have advantage on this because of rage. I do. 21. I run as fast as I can over to Pike and Vax. I have two basic potions. I de-cork both of them and shove them in their gullets. The two of you, inside the mansion. Now. Six. Eight. That couldn't have gone any worse in the beginning. They hit each other maybe once, and then it was all on! Glad Pike was here for the fight! (cheering)
