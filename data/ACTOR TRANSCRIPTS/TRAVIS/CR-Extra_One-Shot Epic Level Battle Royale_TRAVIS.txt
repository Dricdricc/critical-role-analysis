Marvel Puzzle Quest gets the best stuff. Laura would pull my lower lip over my head if I didn't say that the beautiful Critical Role notebook is in the merch store. It's gorgeous. I don't hold it up and Vanna White it as nice as she does, but it's in there. Laura and I will be at SacAnime in Sacramento the first week of January. January 5th through the 7th, I think it is. We'll be in Sacramento. I don't have one because it was going to be all death metal, followed with nursery rhymes. Technonic. Amazing. You've used it twice! I would like to rage. I mean, not really. I want to rage, that's it. Do you want to cast freedom of movement on me? 80 to 100 feet? I won't. I ain't going up there. Oh, wow. 20. Raging, can I run around the side of the tower that's closest to you towards the door of this little Superman shaped-- yep. Can I use siege to knock the fucking door open? 20. A d4 for the fit hands or with the axe? Oh, shit balls ass, sorry. Nope, that's a ten. Eight plus-- Yeah. It is, right, I was using the sword before that. That's an eight on both of them, plus-- Sorry, been a hot minute. 23. Do I have any movement left? What did I end on, 40? Can I make my way to the chest? And it's not a bonus action to open said chest, right? I'll stay in my room! Can I shut the door-- the door's gone. (laughter) Oh, like the worms and stuff. This is for 115 episodes, you bitch! You didn't destroy everything! Where'd he go? Oh, he's off the map? Oh, there he is. (laughter) Totally dick pics, right? She's made of earth. I don't have the deck, by the way. No deck. Why? I mean, technically it's before the Vecna fight but it didn't make the portal. Nothing? All my spells. Can I open le chest du mysterie? Yes, sweet. Great. I have my full movement, right? Can I come out of the room and start making my way toward this area? That sounds great. And this is a solid column? There's no way in there? Okay, so you could-- Wait a minute. If you die, do you come back 30 minutes later, naked, out of the woods? Walks out naked. Lord Colville is like, "I am pleased." The first time it was after me and the second time it was right before me. If you also want to see something pretty, you look behind you, girl. I'm sitting over here flexing. I like that right nipple coming through. Oh, you got fucking smoked by the purple shit! Oh my god. I need to keep living in those places. I don't know what it does, though. How many points, Keyleth? 30. 18 plus 12. Into the water? Okay. What if someone hits her? Good to know. Fire death. Oh God, I was like, what? I'm sorry! Can I use my action and dash to run all the way over to this spot, please? Great. And that will-- That will complete my turn. You haven't even been touched yet. You got high wisdom, yo! Are you sure? You've got a big vendetta against doors. That's amazing! Of course he does! Oh, we do have the earrings in? Oh we can talk shit while we play?! I'm going to teabag you when you're dead. He's just going to come out from wherever he is and help you right now. I would like to smash the door with my bloodaxe. Yeah, either one of those. 21 points of damage. May I entrez-vous, please? I will end my turn. I'm going to mime it. Are you writing a paragraph? Does that mean she can go earth elemental again, or is that it? One little marble you didn't see. You know we kind of need Scanlan to take down Keyleth, right? Don't make Taliesin get up at 530 anymore. It's not good for anyone. 106 points! I'm texting you my turn. I would like to open the chest. Hey, look at that. 19. Oh, I do have resistance because of the belt! Yes, thank you. So ten. Damn, son! From what, homie? Cool. Can I use my movement to run out and toward this hallway? See how far I get. Yeah, I'll stay just outside of it. Yeah, I see you! Hey, Scanlan. He's right behind me. To be clear, I see you, and then I turn my back on you. Yeah, I'm not focused on you right now. I mean I can look at you if you want me to. Can I come inside here. Can you step on that? I mean, I'm just curious. I mean it's hard to-- I'll go through the portal. Can I head this way? Can I dash and continue my action and head towards-- Head down this way. Can I use my bonus action to use my boots of feral leaping to jump into the doorway? No? 27. Oh, it's just the one. 13. That's my whole action. Hey! Through the portal over here. I was coming! I'm in the doorway with a giant earth elemental. I punched my ticket; I'm ready to ring the bell. Keyleth's smug. Scanlan's like Ugh! If I can jump and smash my head on the door like an idiot approaching you, might as well tit for tat. 19. 17. Seven. That's cool. 29. 17 plus 12. I guess so. Start stroking out here in a second. Can I make a retaliation? Is that considered melee? But I'm prone. I haven't been able to say this in a long time Can I make this Reckless, Great Weapon Master? 26. 32. How many elementals can you turn into? An unlimited number of times? Oh. There's a giant tidal wave moving yonder. The whole top of the tower, or just the middle of it? Is there a latch? You could stand on that thing, though, the platform. It looks super-magical, this thing. It's awesome. There's even little feet right here. I don't know what those are. Are they boots? Ice skating? You can do that?! Oh, right. Silent motherfucker. You're a goddamn Navy SEAL. In the room that I'm in, can I see anything on the floor since I've been poisoned fucking twice now?! To see if there's a potion. Hey! Minus how much? Two. 13! Can I get down and (licking)? Not worth it. Okay. Yeah, let's see what happens. Can I run out of the room? I'm going to head towards the back portal. Actually, can I get to here? She's in the water, right? She's not sticking out some? Natural 20! I'm an idiot, but you have to be really dumb to go chopping at the water with an axe. It's just water. She's just going to change again. I'll keep running to the entranceway and I'll stay outside. Do I have any more movement? I can't get around the corner, right? I'm good. Should have a countdown clock. Wait. Mage Slayer. Advantage on saving throws against spells? I have to be in melee of them. I think that might be right. I'm poisoned, so I have disadvantage on saves, right? Because I'm poisoned, I have to roll this again for disadvantage? Not saving throws? 25. Oh, cool. Probably not kill the other caster, you know. You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and then you have Percy silence. Oh, shit. A little unintentional Keyteor. Do the basketball. Yeah, we know, okay, we know. AT&T thanks you for your texts. I'm going to go into the room. Can I stand on the crystal circle? Because I don't see anybody else to hit. I concentrate real hard. Nine. That's it? Do I notice any writing or bones around the circle? I don't see anybody. Does it go out to the water? Did I happen to see Keyleth in her earth elemental form, since I was outside, go whoosh and fly up? That seems wrong. Okay. I'm going to use my bonus action to take one of my superior healing potions and that's my turn. Not me, I'm loving it. I've hit one person. I know. You don't have to make concentration checks when you take damage, right? You just stay elemental. You're that. Gotcha. It'll only be there for four and a half hours from 1230 to 330. I've been looking for Vax! Anti-gravity still going? Can I turn around, since my magic pedestal has not done anything for me, and go through the portal, please? Can I keep going straight across? Can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping to leap horizontally 20 feet? 17. Yeah, fuck it. Can I use my dash to go inside the tower from the bottom door? Well, that's my game. Yeah, no. Seven. I wasn't there. I thought it was put over on that side of the tower. I can't do much but hit things, so you know. Yes. 31. He didn't go in the tower. He just climbed up the side. Good times. Do you want to tell us anything you did? Getting bug zapped. Big southern mosquito. 30! 18 plus 12. Dear god. That's already halved, right? Okay, cool. You did? Cool. With my bonus action, can I use my Second Wind to heal 1d10 plus my stupid-ass fighter level? I'm fucking up here until you don't! It's cool, I'm up there. I'm going to get the immovable rod out in my hand, waiting to fall. I'll hold my action if someone comes within striking range. Can I say that? An action, not an attack. My action so I can click the rod. I'm literally the helium balloon in the grocery store that broke away from the cashier and is fucking sitting up there. I've got another one of those. I won't be. 18. Whatever it is, I'll use my Stone's Endurance. Yeah. I don't know what that first word you said is. Aasimar? My tabaxi tortle. Let me roll my Stone's Endurance. Ten plus my constitution. Minus 16. So 41 minus 16 would be 25. My Stone's Endurance. Not cool! No, you're not. I have a playmate! That's fascinating. Those boots are ridiculous. We're on your side! Let me down! Do I get to use the action to hit the button on the rod somewhere? I'll hit it at 20 feet above the ground. Making that Halo dive. 27. But the muscle's going to get that much bigger. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm singing. I would like to un-click the rod, actually. Yeah. All right. Can I run around over here? Do I see fucking anything? Both totally within range. Is there a door over there that I can't see? Is there a door over on this side? Can I get to the door from where I am? Can I go inside? Oh, okay. There's not a lot I can do. I'm just chasing a bunch of people I can't see. Oh, for the love of god. What the fuck did you just say?! I should go check that out. I love how cocky he is when he's like, I'm going to die! I would try to run up and grapple you or throw something at you, but you're made of fucking wind. Two fireballs in a bunker and no damage. Yeah. What's up? Nope. It's the fire. Would it be stupid to try to grapple a wind elemental? There's not really anything to grab, right? Could I step out the door? Like five feet. All right, let's just try it because fuck it. Can I use my boots of feral leaping to make a 15-foot vertical leap with a DC of 16? Just too much. Could I try and climb up the side of the tower? 18. Cool. I'm going to leap off the tower and try to grab onto Keyleth. Okay. What can I do in this game? Zero because you're immune to grapple. Cool. Fucking flying motherfucker. Yep, fire it up. Do it, please. End my suffering. Give me some kind of contact with another being. Hey, Ki. No problem. Modifier is zero. Five. I don't know. Send me to the Ethereal-- no. Send me to Feywild. Fuck you! (laughter) Figures. Do I? Probably not. Fight on! Doesn't feel good to be a level 20 barbarian with these strong motherfuckers. Chasing your damn tail. I also don't have a Deck, for anybody that's wondering. There's no Deck of Many Things. The crowd. A barbarian's world. The portal's gone. Isn't Plane Shift concentration? I just meant if you get hit-- Drop that motherfucker. He's the king for a reason you guys. Can you shift into things? Especially one of them. Shove a healing potion in his mouth. Not me. With all the magic that I have? Disengage. Shift. Element. You just (poof) right out of it. First time we've seen you in three hours and 45 minutes. I cast Waterlogged. That would've been fun. So casual. Fly into the wall. Do it. Burn yourself up, every inch. Yeah, I went to the Water Plane with a few hundred HP left. I was super healthy in the water. So it's cool. That is the most messed-up map I've ever seen.
