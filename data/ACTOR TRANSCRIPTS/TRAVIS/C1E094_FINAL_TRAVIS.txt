Ashley Johnson! For a bit. Take it back! (high-pitched) Yeah! Foster Wayne Brian. We also took some of your semen. Yeah! I'm so excited. I just love Seattle. I do. 12th Man. Woo! Yeah, that's it. Oh, one shriek! She met her, like, in the flesh. You didn't cry, did you? That I were with. She's still stroking out from it. (laughter) Like mid-rib. Can't run away. And there's photographic evidence. Your life is complete. You know, that guy that played at your father's whatever. (sings Terminator theme) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fuuuu-- Could we have done that any closer to the razor's edge? I'm just saying. Yep. Trip ones. Well you still get two ones. Don't run, don't run! He attacks with his teeth if you run. Yeah, freeze. Nose up. Let him see your nose hairs. Good nose action. Yeah. Human relations. What? Oh. Yeah. How long did you have Do-oh-ty? To the thing. Oh! Yeah! How does it feel being such an accomplished adventurer now? I have a question. What is a sleep mask? Does it go over your whole head? I know there's a lot of money in being a man whore. Yeah. Sell your body, you know? Put that hair to good use. Start making some coin. Try that out? You know what, we're going to find out, right? Let's just roll the dice and see where they fall. It's okay, it's okay. No, there's no way. I always forget the name. Yep! We went to hell. Oh, man, Pike! Look! Look who it is! Like what? Like, you would have gone dark Pike or something? That's not a risk we want to take. Why would you even volunteer that? It's just what you do! Did we even tell her why we went to hell? Oh. Hey! The word on the street? Screaming in terror. Yeah. Yup. Who was? Who? Just point him out! Point him out. He doesn't need his ears anymore. You probably were! I see sweat! You're real strong! Those are pythons. We'll case the landscape. Nope. Holy shit. Yeah, what's your type? What do you mean, no? Uh-huh. No accounting for taste. I do have a lot of those things. A mate. You know what, best to just throw him to the wolves. Let's just get after it. Good, good, okay. Smash cut to-- (loudly) Do you have food and drink in this establishment? Do you have turkey legs? Turkey legs. Shit, the gauntlet has been thrown down. I need two turkey legs for each one of these beautiful people here. She booped me on the fucking nose. Just put one Grog, zero for Tary, because that's happening later. I'm just saying. You've got to start claiming them now, because once Grog starts putting the vibe out, they just come running. Moral compass. What about win the affections of? Hold on, I've piqued Tary's interest over there. Okay. My magic what? Oh, the jug. Oh. Whoa. Whoa, shit got real. How about-- How about, the jug for that fancy fishing lure of a helmet you've got. I don't, it's just shiny. So can mine, baby. (laughter) Dragon killer, debt eraser, takes all shapes and forms. The jug for the rod. Yeah. Yup. Yep. All right. I'm waiting on my turkey legs. Just watch. Watch and learn. Oh, you are too kind. And a beauty, to boot. By the way, do you happen to have-- We've just come back from a very intense battle-- do you happen to have a needle and thread? My darling, it's because I'm so ripped. All right. Beware, this is a no-win zone. Don't get too close. Yep, yep, I need another drink, don't you? Man, why, I think that's a good idea. Would you like to take a load off? Join us for a bit, I'm sure your legs are super tired. Man, I can just picture the spot in my bag of holding that that rod is going to go into. Yep. You might as well just pack it up right now. Basically? I'll give you a layup, all right? You go on and just repeat after me. You just say I want to be on you. Yeah, yeah, you just got to be blunt, right? You went the real flowery, like, exotic way. Now just baseline it. Right. You've got to get the dial tone delivery. I want to be on you. Forgot the rod? Oh! I forgot we're trying to get you laid. It's a competition. Right, sorry. Sorry. Hold on. I'm going to try and seal this up right now. I get up and leave the table and I go over to the barmaid. Wow. Do you want a hand with that? Yeah, give them to me. You look so busy. Could you do me a favor? If I give you like a lot of money, will you tell the guy over there that we had a sweet shag? You look really busy, and I don't want to offend-- That's a two. Casanova. Two plus one. Shit, numbers. Did she say no? She said no? All right, I walk back to the group. It's me and her later tonight. Yeah. 20. I can't roll any higher than that. Later tonight, player! Why? I'm hooking up. Fine, jeez. Draw. Just because. I don't show anything and drink it all. (laughter) An armored bear. Well, you have-- This is so great. The one romance you had before, did it go well? It didn't? No. Yes. Tary, did you want to get laid tonight? No? I mean, I'll pay for it. Yeah. Have you ever been to the lady favors? Yeah. Yep. Yeah, you go in, throw some spaghetti on the wall, see what sticks, and have a great time. There might be. (laughter) What do you think, huh? I know if we had said, "you're going to fight a dragon and a "kraken," you'd be like, "no, not me!" But this is a chance for you to go to the big time. Pike is crushing it! Don't go shopping next time. I never do. Yeah! She beat me at arm wrestling. Do not puke. Do not puke. Yeah. But I probably couldn't take you. Dude, I had a thing for Trish once upon a time. Yeah. Well, I mean-- No, I am not CB-ing that action, all right? Yeah, canary blocking. I agree with Percy. Yeah, why don't you go walk down the hallway? It's outside the room. Yeah, but I give a shit about Scanlan. He's not here. He's fine. It's a group whisper! We're closing it! The question, was if you saw anything or not? So question, do we crash here for the night or do we make it back to the (hiccup) castle? Why don't we do it old school and just crash here for the night? That way, Tary can take his time and in the morning we (hiccup) oh god I got so much burps-- Then in the morning we can head back out. To the (hiccup) castle. These fucking peanuts are amazing. Not sure what I'm eating, but I think they're peanuts. Might be nails. But we've got to wait on Tary! Is he? Yeah, look, you may go back to your fluffy bed, but my man's in the deed and I'm sticking around to slap hands afterwards. Silver tongued, huh. Yeah, me too. (belches) Keep an eye on our 34,000 gold-onaire. Sorry, it smells like a fart. I know! She's like a bitch but in a furious way. I know-- And if she gives you the eyebrow and then you're like-- (sobs) Yeah. I know! And her fur and-- (blows nose) It's not fair, I tell you. Good shit. What? Yep. Well, who talks back? Aw! That's awful! (shaky breathing) I've never tried that before. Right. Sometimes I go into like, the house of lady favors-- And I'm like, one for me and one for... me! (sobs) How do you think Tary's doing? I don't either. Oh really? Like? Let the river take you where it will. Yeah, I do too. I mean, it's probably because you've been crying so much. Yeah, yeah. I mean, the water's got to come from somewhere, right? I don't know. (laughter) Cheese and flowers. (snores) (snorts) That's my pinwheel! Somebody left that there. It's fine. Yeah. Do you-- Yeah. Jerky? We got alcohol sweats. Oh, enough about us. Yep. Tary, you didn't just give each other massages all night, did you? Oh, good. Yeah. It can be confusing. Especially in the dark, right? Oh. No. That's a 16. I feel like we need to commemorate this. You're not the same man you were when we last saw you last night. Should we go get tattoos or get you a new haircut or something to commemorate this? It's a temple? (laughter) (laughs) Did you cast Sanctuary? (laughter) Yo. Yeah man, come on. It's right up your alley. Tracking, hunting. Yeah. So what'd he say? She's so cool. Right? When are you going to do this amazing think-real-hard? Yeah, pretty uncool. No! No! Cat trying to squeeze in the shoebox. Beautiful. Get it, get it! What does that mean? It's cocked. It's leaning up against the side. Oh, breaking out the foliage! (sings) It's a circle of trees. Oh my god, look at that thing. I should have talked? No. Like that guy when he's unloading the shotgun in Jurassic Park? I should really be rolling better in taverns, though. Ooh! That yellow one. Two ones in a row. No dice jail for that one? You went up higher! Ooh. Kobayashi Maru, you got this. What did that belong to? Don't second-guess yourself! You're alive! You did good! And you did it by yourself. Oh my god. Can I have that? I just want to go over and fold all the fingers back except the middle one. (laughter) A message from beyond! (laughter) Yup. (whispers) Render. Really? One year later, huh? Never? He's like, "What does favored terrain get me?"
