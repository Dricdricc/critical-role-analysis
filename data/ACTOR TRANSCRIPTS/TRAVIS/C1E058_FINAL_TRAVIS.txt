Yeah, they will! Stick figures for the win. They’re so pretty! I want it in a frame. It’ll be a surprise. It’s going to be great. We're going to draw on each others' faces with toothpaste. Yeah, Liam’s going to hold the plank position for 2 hours. Yep. Roll like a turtle. Let’s get it! Let’s get it! Wow. (all laugh) We're all watching. Shit. Thug Life glasses come down, joint comes up. Bu-bu-bu-bu-blam, gutshot! (all laugh) You got this, you're fine. 16. (laughing gasp) All 3 or everybody else? Have advantage. 18. Shit. Four-two? Four?! What floor are we on? Made out. Under the moonlight. (laugh) I spring out of my bed because I don't sleep with any armor on, I got all me bits on me, and I grab my axe and I kick the door open! Because I know jenga. It's one of my favorite words. I'm like, (wordless aggressive sounds) Is there anybody in the hallway? Where are the stairs? Fucking shit! So I start tearing down the hallway as far as me little legs can carry me. I'll dash. And the dash was my bonus action right? So I have a bonus? Can I look down and say, "Hello, muppet." And I would like to rage. (all laugh) Polite as fuck. Please fail. Nice. Nice job. Disarm him? Yep. Oh, god. Thanks, Matt. I’m going to take out my hand! Smoke him! Puddins, Pike. Yep, 8. 11, 19. 27. And that’s her, the one to the right of me? Thatta girl! That’s a bad bitch. Poison sucks. Does she burst out in the hallway naked with a mace and a shield? If he takes care of you, though... That was in Pike’s room? Good, okay. Yes yes yes. I’ve never hit! Nice. I don’t know what that expression was. (laughing) Is that "Roxanne?" I couldn’t even join in because it was so good. So I heard him say, "I’m going down," right? We all heard him say he’s going down as he was falling? This’ll be great. Ah! 18 minus... (all laugh) Yeah, probably. I look out and I say, "Oh, Pike, you’re in your birthday suit! "Are you all right?" Okay. Is there a window in the hallway? My question is, is the courtyard through those windows? Right. Is there - Do all of the rooms have windows, or is there a window in the hallway? Fucking ass. Can I hold my... turn until Keyleth goes? I will - where are you? Yeah, but I can go back in. I should just stay there if you’re going to make a door. What? Yeah. I just want out. So I’ll hold until Keyleth goes, and I won’t move. I’ll stay there, because she’s right beside - I will hold my... movement. I have to choose what she’s going to do? I'm so confused. I don’t know. I don’t know what to say, I - Yeah. I don’t move. I decide to stand still. Otherwise, I’m running down a hallway for no reason. I just don’t move. I just stand there dumbfounded that Pike is naked and cut to shit. No, but I can’t do anything. I wanted to move through the door once she made it. What do I say, I hold a dash? Or a hold a movement? Oh, okay. I would like to hold a dash. We’re still learning. Hold a dash for Keyleth’s turn. I didn’t do my homework. Well, I only sleep naked in the lady-favors house. Vasselheim, yeah, they’re on the lax. I mean Whitestone. Okay okay okay. (singing) You’ve got the world on... TRAVIS AND Nice. You do know what it means? That fucking smirk. As per uzh. Which I totally whispered, but just not loud enough. You are omnipotent, my man. No, you stayed on. It has no effect? Why does it have no effect? Why don’t you get any additional? (count quietly) 21. Yeah. He smoked both of them, yeah. We’re still on the roof. It’s just Scanlan and Vax down there. He doesn’t see us. He doesn’t know where it’s coming. Right? (high-pitched) Right? Oh, shit. He’s really thinking about this. Joey. What was he doing? What was the effect? Oh, really? It was! Can I see them at all from the roof? Sweet anus! Reason to jump! But I make it look like I landed really hard! Can I continue my movement in his direction as far as I can go? 50 feet. Is he another 20 feet away? Can I take my... Can I attach the Blood Axe to my Chain of Returning and hurl it at the rakshasa? Only in the house of lady favors do I let my beans hang out when I sleep. Reckless attack. Thank god. Not much better. 17. Oh, yay! 6! That’s 26 with 6 points of necrotic damage. Nope. Oh, then yeah, I’ll pull it back. Just (whoosh). What is it? Oh, thank you. 11. Meant to do that. Oh, it’s 15, sorry. Yeah. You said it. Doo-doo-doo. Fight! (whispers) 19. But that’s it - Oh! Oh! That was sweet! I run over and I give Pike a fancy robe. You killed him before? Oh. Didn’t finish him off, did you? Like, die, or like he “ah” fell? That’s pretty dead. So he’s a vampire. Can I look at Vax and ask him what he’s wearing? Yeah, how did that happen? I pull it off. Are there any pieces of the rakshasa left? I’ll go, too, just as security. What are you doing? Nope, all out. I do have one other fancy robe. Mmm. Yes? All right. Last fancy robe to Vax. Aren't there acid pools down here? Yeah, there are. That's what I was going to ask. Probably a good idea. Should I check the Bag of Holding now? Can I reach in for a fancy robe? Awesome. I wind it up like a towel and I smack Vax on the ass super hard. Bare ass. Bare ass I get it really good, like (whack)! Yeah? Yeah, me, too. Here you go. (whssht) Yeah, put it on, fucker. (gleeful laughter) Yes! Are we killing this one? Should I throw him the robe? I thought I threw him the robe. Gilmore will remember that. Awesome. How many were there? Whoa. Cool. Cool. Respect. “I have on a robe, I have on a robe!” Allura? I'll go for Cassandra with you because I don't trust that bitch. Yeah. Well, this one did. (quietly) Also ale. Is his face super crushed? Well hold on, let me reach into his mouth. And I reach up under his nasal cavity and I pop his face back out just a little bit. It's like a deflated soccer ball, right? (overlapping) Hotis hired us. The Clasp in Stillben. How did the rakshasa know to find us here? How did Hotis know. Or who would know more than him? Or who does he report to? It's stupid - ASHLEY AND So good. I'll take care of this. Hm. Sloppy. Oh. (ahem) I said. Super. Yeah. Flaying? SAM AND Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Why? I'm not putting my bits where Vax's were. I'll just keep it in the Bag. Yes, Baldrick's somewhere. What?! Oh, fucking shit. Good moment. He's alive. Let it go. Holy shit. Holy shit. Cask of ale is out and the ale is flowing. Yep. Triple-speed, damn. That’s a fast-ass wolf. Technically, hair of the dog would be poisoning him again this morning. Which we can do. Talk to your daggers while you do it. You hear a whisper from the coffee mug saying, "I own you." (all laugh) You all right, mate? Oh. Like, the shits or the twirls? The shits it's just one end, the other, both. North, south, all at the same time. It's like a relay race. Yeah. (laughing) Oh, shit. Amazing. If you've had the twirls, you never forget them. Yeah, be very thorough. Yep, absolutely. Open your mouth, stick out your tongue. Stick out your tongue! I grab his tongue. Kima, you see anything in there? Any bumps? Mumps? Pull his tongue a little bit more. I release, I release. Oh, Vax doesn't feel well. He shit and puked all over the area in the back. You're killing him. Percy, if you're feeling gross, you can imagine - go examine the leftovers over there. Yep, yep. Just make sure you crawl in on your hands and knees. Why? What kind of water? I'll do it. Could I have some ass-water, please? Regular water, please? He still feels bad, keep looking! Find a toy car... Are you done with the jug? Can I have that back, please? Thank you. Mimosas? Well, there's one way to find out. Mimosas, please. Shit. Bloody Marys, please. Fuck! Look, you put a lot of stress on it, all right? It made your ass-water just fine. No, I think it only works for a little bit every day. You could try it. Holy shit, you're magic! (laughing) Monster magic! Oh, you're reading. We did your - give me the jug. Don't you fucking hold onto that, Percy, you give it back right now. (all laugh) I catch it. Yep. Good boy. I mean, we might as well let him keep his prize. 320. Go give him a pet, Pike. Sourpuss. Baldrick, thank you. You are free to do with this as you will. Signs point to yes. Yeah, you keep practicing to be a monster. Okay. Yeah! No. Yeah. Dragon-slayer and Rakshasa-slayer. Feywild? You thought it was stupid when I said it, but what? (laughs) It's off the table. It's an automatic fail. She's actually cackling. "Vex'ahlia." Oh. Ow! Shit! 6. (all laugh) Who wants to go right fucking now? I was in the middle of a gorgeous cup of ale and I'm wearing half of it! I rush the guy with the burnt chicken and I pick him up, and I throw him across the tavern. Who's with the burnt chicken piece of shit? (laughing) Yes! (laughing) Whole-tavern brawl. Not the face. Not the face. (laughs) Yes! Amazing. Take a few, yes. I sell them a bit more than they're worth. (all laugh) Yeah. I will. We're the original O.G., you know that? Well, I guess original and O is redundant, but - Yeah. Yeah, we're the O-O-G. Yeah. Ooh, ooh! Can I find Pike? And I say, "Hey, wait. Before I go, "do you want me to keep a special eye on Scanlan, "since he proposed marriage?" What? Oh. Yeah. I mean, you really are. He got a little swept up, carried away. Is there anybody I should keep a special eye on? (all laugh) Oh, yeah? Like, magically? All right. You just let me know. I'm an extra layer of protection. Me? That's never part of the plan. All right. Hey! When I come back, those Gauntlets of Ogre Strength? I wanna see 'em super beat up. Okay. We'll compare damage box. (buuh) Bye, Pike. Should we - since they're all smart and stuff - ask them anything in particular about the Feywild? Deep. Shit. Okay. Oh, yeah, let's actually do it, yeah. (laughing) Epcot Center. There was a lake in the middle of the - No, no, it's a portal to the Feywild. What? Pfft. Yeah. Which part? Peanut butter and jelly. But we'll be back. We'll do stuff next week. We're wearing these awesome shirts. Keyleth's got one. I'm rocking - Alex Murphy, RoboCop, holla. Aim long, strike true, a War God's Blessing upon you. So many good messages. I like your hair! Oh, yeah. We're going to steal you back whenever we can. (laughs) Yeah.
