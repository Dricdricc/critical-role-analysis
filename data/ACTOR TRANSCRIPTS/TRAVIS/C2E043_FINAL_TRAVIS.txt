Our friend Beau here, I trust, 021801.039 --> 021806.963 has shown you her journal. 021808.050 --> 021813.057 Great king, if we may, time we have. 022013.847 --> 022015.796 It's at your whim that we serve. I think it would be only fair to ask that we remain under 022023.088 --> 022027.465 guard while your compatriot here translates that text. 022027.465 --> 022029.267 Fair enough. 022031.088 --> 022037.177 (stuttering) Is she talking to me? 022514.849 --> 022515.545 Plank King, if I may. My ears, though pointy, can only stand a certain amount of 022530.006 --> 022536.492 dishonesty. I would prefer to cut through the bull. There are those of us among us who can make 022536.492 --> 022544.830 sure that the truth is spoken here. I would beg of you to allow that to happen now. 022544.830 --> 022547.475 Natural 20. 022552.665 --> 022602.327 (cheering) 022602.327 --> 022608.983 (whispering) Who has that shit? 022621.675 --> 022624.403 You do? 022625.919 --> 022631.072 Honorable Plank King, the means justify the ends. My compatriot here will place her Cobalt 022640.366 --> 022645.427 knuckles upon the chin of Avantika and you will hear the truth. You need but only ask your 022645.427 --> 022648.317 questions again. 022648.317 --> 022655.155 (whispering) Monk stuff! 022729.292 --> 022730.659 Make sure you tell the Plank King it's a limited time engagement. 022813.002 --> 022814.384 (laughter) Those poor fuckers! 023146.751 --> 023152.595 Stone-cold killer. 023158.034 --> 023159.994 That is beyond a generous sentence. 023226.405 --> 023233.652 We'll make do. We will leave with great haste. 023242.396 --> 023250.238 Sin eater! 023333.359 --> 023336.307 You're a prospector! 023423.825 --> 023428.363 Avantika's crew are still manacled up? 023446.891 --> 023453.651 No. Maybe one or two of them. Ipess? 023458.193 --> 023500.072 What? We've got to have somebody to kill while we're at sea. 023503.053 --> 023503.957 Better. Yeah, and they do. 023512.329 --> 023521.650 If I may, who is really good at finding shit? You two, and anyone-- 023656.133 --> 023657.255 Yeah. How about you three, into Avantika's quarters and turn it upside down. 023702.344 --> 023706.140 Not my intention, but go ahead. 023707.396 --> 023708.017 Okay. 023708.692 --> 023715.041 Is Jester able to mend some of those damaged--? 023807.985 --> 023812.114 Is that a good thing? 024127.693 --> 024129.022 It's a good thing. 024132.168 --> 024137.257 Can I find Orly? 024145.159 --> 024145.873 I'll bring out the map. 024148.431 --> 024151.111 I don't have it near me. 024152.575 --> 024153.806 Do we know where the map is, please? 024156.953 --> 024158.675 Damn it, Bobby! 024207.310 --> 024209.335 Do we know if we are making our way--? 024232.070 --> 024235.836 I'll tell Orly Orly, if you could help us plot a course, as damaged as we are, heading north 024251.563 --> 024254.114 to this point. 024254.114 --> 024256.793 Wow. 024306.969 --> 024314.902 Wait, who played him? 024333.730 --> 024335.334 Because this is on a trade run, and this whole isle is part of that, could we make port for 024355.193 --> 024357.595 more extensive repairs there? 024357.595 --> 024401.857 Resupply? 024406.537 --> 024407.374 That's the closest thing. 024411.474 --> 024412.813 Divination? What do you mean? 024415.417 --> 024421.140 I would love to have you do that. 024431.643 --> 024433.349 It is, but we don't have any other-- 024506.572 --> 024510.048 Thank you for the Shawshank obtuse reference. 024540.725 --> 024550.960 You look rejuvenated. Did you say Bisaft? 024805.587 --> 024810.833 You're sure? 024812.694 --> 024815.137 All right then. You can let Orly know. 024817.680 --> 024819.671 Will we pass over that area as we're heading towards Bisaft? 025206.155 --> 025213.584 No, I'm just asking. 025219.143 --> 025225.225 Yeah. 025815.573 --> 025819.278 Relieved. 025821.851 --> 025823.014 Yeah. I was worried for a moment there. I knew it was going to come to something like that, 025829.662 --> 025832.420 but Caleb pulling the trigger the way he did was-- 025832.420 --> 025835.253 Yeah. 025836.718 --> 025838.223 Right. 025839.198 --> 025840.908 He did. He's very strong. 025845.180 --> 025852.203 I think so, yeah. 025855.179 --> 025858.835 No, I didn't. It hurts to see so many react to a name that only meant so much to me, 025912.120 --> 025919.036 but-- I don't even know if he's alive. We might find him down there. 025919.322 --> 025928.397 We'll see. 025935.619 --> 025939.489 What do you mean? 025943.035 --> 025947.992 You send messages to Kiri? 025953.223 --> 025954.159 What do you say? 025955.380 --> 030000.073 Can she respond to these messages? 030013.487 --> 030022.687 (as Jester) Go fuck yourself. 030024.037 --> 030028.619 Right. I suppose, what would you put in the letter to the Plank King? 030034.481 --> 030036.788 I mean, I don't know if it's necessary. I can't think of anything as of yet. I don't know, 030053.029 --> 030055.926 maybe I'll just let you know. Thank you for offering, though. 030055.926 --> 030059.575 Yeah. 030102.870 --> 030107.338 Okay, all right. Yeah. Thank you for not telling the others. 030117.639 --> 030121.491 I've got to go check on Orly, make sure we're going the right way. 030126.804 --> 030129.786 The island. 030154.431 --> 030200.104 Fucking secrets. 030229.352 --> 030232.535 I appreciate that, Orly. Hey, Caduceus, do you have any way of, I don't know-- you've got 030359.161 --> 030405.073 those vibes, right?-- feeling down and, I don't know, doing a little ping on the bottom? 030405.141 --> 030408.005 I don't know, I don't want to put you in a box or anything, but you seem to pick up the most. 030411.750 --> 030419.254 I'll summon the falchion and I'll say Maybe try to locate this, and I'll point towards 030442.632 --> 030447.714 the eye. Not this eye, but a similar eye. 030447.714 --> 030449.007 Nope. 030450.189 --> 030452.122 How long do we have? 030537.969 --> 030539.305 Yeah? What, like two days and then go fix the boat proper and come back if we have to? 030601.021 --> 030603.907 How about we spend two to three days, and if we don't find it, we can go and repair the boat 030608.869 --> 030611.039 proper or at least get the materials to do that? 030611.039 --> 030615.434 Sure we can. 030626.026 --> 030628.616 Nott, I would leave it at your discretion. We all have the ability to travel under the waves 030704.690 --> 030707.160 with great ease. 030707.160 --> 030712.093 I have a way of making it so that water becomes like air for you down there. 030717.829 --> 030722.637 It feels a little thicker, like if you were in a really dense fog, maybe? 030728.818 --> 030730.980 It is. 030732.474 --> 030738.368 Or you could stay above if you wanted to send a Message if some trouble appears on the 030742.797 --> 030747.390 horizon, I'd just hate to leave you behind on such a great adventure. There could be buttons, there 030747.390 --> 030750.553 could be little jewels, ingots-- 030750.553 --> 030754.912 What are you talking about? Iit's the bottom of the ocean. Ships throw people all the time. 030757.859 --> 030801.649 I heard tell there was a button ship that crashed right along the water. 030809.224 --> 030817.345 Yep. 030818.119 --> 030820.786 There might be bronzed shoes, maybe little silver cups. Decoder rings. 030850.588 --> 030857.511 We're coming upon the area, right? 030907.033 --> 030916.190 Yeah, I think so. 030939.117 --> 030940.107 13. 031056.434 --> 031105.577 11. 031213.185 --> 031228.556 You did? 031239.150 --> 031242.771 Come on, you got it. 031411.732 --> 031414.071 20. 031436.744 --> 031440.332 I think that means it's probably not down there, but I'd still like to take a look. 031519.319 --> 031521.464 I think so. We're starting to round an area that I think we could probably fan out and 031525.919 --> 031529.299 explore amongst the seven of us. 031529.509 --> 031541.519 That is, actually. If it wouldn't be too much trouble, Caleb, that would be-- 031547.198 --> 031555.615 Yeah, I'd be okay with it. 031638.348 --> 031639.979 His ears are just dripping saliva. 031934.549 --> 031937.636 MATT and That is great news. Does anybody not want to join? Really? You want to stay up here? 032050.194 --> 032053.043 I'll cast a little-- on you and for 24 hours, you can breathe underwater freely. 032130.134 --> 032131.546 Yeah. You could hold onto my shoulders if you wanted to. 032137.212 --> 032140.091 Actually, we could take a few of the cannonballs to just-- 032149.852 --> 032151.602 That's because of the air. You're going to have to equalize. 032202.265 --> 032204.003 But if you're breathing water, there's no air to expand or contract. 032207.087 --> 032211.286 After a certain depth. There's only one way to find out. 032215.242 --> 032221.280 I know. I do, too. Those that want to join, join me at the rail. I'll jump on and sit on the rail. 032228.809 --> 032232.018 We're not on the boat, we're in sand. 032310.173 --> 032311.569 I'll leave Orly in command while we head under. To complete this spell, I'm going to need 032411.426 --> 032414.345 everyone to hold hands in a circle. 032414.345 --> 032422.445 Do we need to have the rights to that song? 032438.904 --> 032440.951 Uh-huh. Cool. 032452.713 --> 032454.513 Well, while it's happening, because it was such a good song, I will cast Underwater Breathing 032513.718 --> 032516.362 on all seven of us. 032516.362 --> 032520.078 Cannonballs? 032558.511 --> 032601.323 Well, we could just use four and have two people hold on to the same cannonball. 032632.229 --> 032637.360 I don't suppose we have 700 feet of rope on this ship, do we? 032659.759 --> 032703.130 If you're ready, take a seat on the rail and I'll hop up and put my butt out towards the sea. 032721.516 --> 032723.074 Yasha does. 032727.460 --> 032728.534 You need a minute? 032737.482 --> 032739.395 Ah, smart. 032802.711 --> 032805.280 He's just fucked. 032828.900 --> 032830.189 But he's got a good tan now and some scars, his clothes are kind of fucked up. 032919.148 --> 032921.923 On the count of three, when you're ready, you'll lean backwards off the rail and fall into 033028.561 --> 033029.662 the water. 033029.662 --> 033031.513 Ooh, make a little handle. 033108.671 --> 033110.372 You want to share a cannonball, Jester? 033128.772 --> 033129.671 Okay. 033130.370 --> 033136.692 She gets her own cannonball because she's-- 033138.289 --> 033139.355 Yeah, she's just like that. Just holding it like a beast. 033144.408 --> 033145.590 Ready? One, two, three. 033152.173 --> 033153.120 I try to catch Nott. How is she doing? 033229.523 --> 033231.392 Are you breathing well? I give her a-- 033233.414 --> 033235.253 International sign for breathe. 033237.202 --> 033243.371 Actually, that means go down. 033254.057 --> 033257.252 (gurgling) Well listen, Nott, as long as we're down here-- 033359.388 --> 033403.476 Aww, baby calves. 033608.731 --> 033616.302 19. 033629.698 --> 033630.776 Five for her. 033642.269 --> 033649.987 I push forward towards it. Point and start to swim. 033747.813 --> 033754.139 What a game! 033806.379 --> 033807.753 There was a number of scenarios that didn't happen? 033825.413 --> 033828.634 Well said. 033848.351 --> 033851.602 I think all anyone asked is for some slight improvements in our planning over the 033937.215 --> 033938.940 years. Slight improvements. 033938.940 --> 033940.572
