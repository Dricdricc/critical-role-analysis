Holy shit! Those fucking vocals, son. That shit. The synth gives me 80s life in the best way. I will be watching that on repeat until 300am. The d20 ring? Where the 20 is the CR logo, too? It's so pretty! (drum beat) [click, TV static] [groovy Critical Role theme] That's a lot of fucking energy this early in the morning. God. (clears throat) Do you have to go and kill it first? Yeah. What are we going to do until then? I mean, should we explore the street that we're on? I mean, we've got a long wait time. They took the cart. The old movie theater grab? If you don't mind us asking, why are you heading into the swamp yourself? Repeats stuff, yeah. Yes. Yep. Mm-hmm. Are you getting paid for this item retrieval? Yeah. What have you been doing after school? Honey? Very open, yeah. We're like best friends. So you're searching for a bowl. And used in rituals? Our business might be headed out that way a little later today. Does she have any weapons on her that are visible? Not me! Yes. That's okay. 17. Do you think they're sending people to get it there before you? Oh, good for us. Is that code for something? And you have a reason to believe that they are expeditiously heading towards this bowl as well? Listen, we are kind of heading in that direction. Yes! I understand that completely. You and I, we're going to be real close, I can feel. I know, they can tell. No. I'm allergic. Although I don't think we're going to have time for that. If you're going to join us, you're going to have to work for your food, you understand? My name's Fjord, by the way. I understand. Unfortunately, my daughter is very particular about shiny and expensive things, so if this bowl has any worth, I'm afraid we might need to be compensated for our troubles. Did you happen to bring any coin with you? We normally have a no stranger policy, but we'll keep a close eye on you. If you get up to any tricksy business-- I hear you talking still. Yeah, Yasha and Molly, they'll remove your head for you. You understand? Should we have her sign something? I mean, should we have a release form? Good, you're in. Well, we'll see how we are at the end of the day. Bet that'll fix itself. You're overthinking it Caleb. Febron, any suggestions whether to move through the muck fine land or through the trees? The where? We'll leave it, it'll be fine, daughter. No. You've been naughty. No. And gets eaten. Jester's regret. I think you tell kids to run with scissors, she'll be fine. Can we check to make sure nobody's following us as we're heading out? Plus four, 16. Good pull! Deep pull already! That was like 40 minutes ago! No please, lead on. We're quite anxious to get there. Fine, I'll take the lead, who wants to join me? Thank you both, don't fight. What are you talking about? I honestly don't have an answer for that. You said it right, it's "Ford." Oh, Jesus, Kiri. All right, let's go. All right. You're actually going to be scouting, right? Three out of five. Beau. Right, front-- It's really reassuring when there's a question mark on the end of your statement. Are you still drunk? Oh jeez. 14. Can we see a source where it came from? A plant or a-- I think that doesn't look very hospitable. Yeah? Cali, that is a very good idea. I mean, hoping the pollen's not flammable, but sure try it. Caleb. I'll give it a whirl. I'll reach up near my eye, and you see this little arc of energy pop out from my eye towards my hand. I'll throw it forward and cast Witch Bolt. Oh, thank you, yeah. Ten plus six, 16. Okay, great. This is overkill, it's 3d12. That's nine-- 27 points of damage. No, it was a really encouraging display. I was not expecting it to be so durable. Not anymore with these rolls. I actually tend to agree. I don't want to leave things undiscovered. Are you? Surf pro. (disgusted) Oh, yeah. Super inviting. Just all the tendons. (cat growling) Did you hear anything, snoring? Jester, bones aren't normally a very good sign. You didn't happen to see a bowl, did you? Very wise. Do you think we'll be able to find our way back here? Should we mark a tree or something like that? Which way's your ass? Fair enough. Lead on. You did a good job the first time, let's take it up again. I think our speed is halved in the conditions, right? Doing the slo-mo game. Which is really not losing much at this point. Maybe we try to outmaneuver this one now. Ooh, 17 plus one. 18. Hold. I saw movement. Off to our side, 40 to 50 feet into the trees. Fan out a little bit. Yeah, fan out. Who wants to move towards it with me? Yasha, Molly, Cali, and Fjord. We'll walk towards it. But fan out, not together. Maybe ten, 15 feet in between us. Like a fire line. But fanned fire line. Is it moving fast-- easily in this terrain? (whispering) Do not see me! Toucan? With a belly? Shh, Jester! We'll keep moving around the edge of the lake. Who wants to keep an eye on his area as we're moving? Jester and Molly, you keep an eye as we keep moving forward. We'll come back to where the casters are. No, they're going to stay with us in a tight group. But they're going to keep their eyes as we move. Mind your slice of the pie, all right, you guys? You're a fan of pie, so. Heard of something like that around here? Yeah, I don't know if that's going to work for me. All right, let's get moving. Try and ignore this. We'll give him a chance whether he engages or not No stealth. Maybe a little faster than our regular, too. Some people? I saw it. What do you want to do? Not too far. Or we could just keep letting him match. We could, or Jester, you're pretty friendly. You want to see if--? What's the trap made of? Okay, how about this Yasha, I'm sure you'll agree, we can make one move to see if it's interested in non-violence and then we have the advantage here now. I don't like being tailed in particular. Don't you? That means literally nothing to me. I don't think we should stealth. Fuck the ambush. There's nine of us. One of him. Molly, Yasha, and I will not be stealthing and heading inward, and we'll be just behind Jester's diplomatic envoy. (sarcastically) Oh no, I was enjoying our closeness. Are we sure it's the same one? 17. Yes, perfect. Mushrooms. Question answered. Did it move away? Do you want to chase it? I think that's a good call. We'll stagger back towards the back line of our group. 15. Maybe we can get back to talking to the dead people? Which one's got the better mouth? Easy, Kiri, easy. Settle, settle. Underground. Did any of it precede the attack? He's fucking huge! I thought he was humanoid-sized! Why did you go try to be friends with that? What are you thinking? This is north, towards me? Xenomorph blood. Is he unconscious? Is he done? Is that it? Jester and Cali? 14 as well. Oh my god! 33. Can I move 15 feet towards the troll? I'll see the gore and poison splattering all over Beau and little sizzles coming up and shit, and I'm like Eh, Eldritch Blast! (screams, blasts) Okay. Oh, that's 26 to hit. And 25 to hit. Those were monsters, jeez. 1d10 plus four, that's eight points on the first one, and that's 14 points on the second one. Oh, shit, right! 33. Yeah, don't anybody else hit it. Yeah, I cast Regret. (laughing) You didn't really like that character that much, did you? That's what happened to Febron. I don't either. I mean, I got something that holds, but it damages, too. No! How? You can use your str-- Yeah. Modern Literature! We don't know what that is. What?! How's Febron? A soggy KFC drumstick. Send it packing, Molly. What does it sound like? Hadouken! Glug glug? She doesn't have a glug glug. I'll move five feet closer towards el troll, and I'll say Get the fuck out of here! And I'll Eldritch Blast twice. That's going to miss anyway, and the second one. They both miss. You get your ass out of this forest! Yeah, get the fuck on out! Nobody wants you here, anyway! Sure, I'll do it. I'll take two more Eldritch Blasts at it. At disadvantage, right? That's a natural one. My bad. 19. 18! That'll hit, that's 25. 1d10. That's nine plus four. 13 points of Eldritch Blast. You fucking piece of shit! Don't you dare tell us what we're starting to think! Yeah, that's right. We know where his hovel is. So lesson learned. Beau is just You fucking--! Still one more question. Yeah, in fact, could we could take a short rest while Caleb's doing that since that was a little gnarlier than we anticipated? So good! Finish her. How far does that extend? It occurred to me from what your friend said that this location might not be entirely above ground any longer. Yeah. Two hours past, what was it, noon? Maybe it only becomes visible at a certain time? Since there are things that'll be snagging bitches when we get separated. Cali, do you plan to go back to Port Damali after this if you're successful? Absolutely. Well, let's try our luck. Certainly not welcome. Is the water around the tree in a circle, like it pans out from around the side? I'll go with her, just to accompany. Or when, if someone grabs you from the shore. Easiest to remember. LIAM and There's a teal piece of fabric that's tied up on a branch. How deep is the water without the water being dispersed? Near the base of the tree. Oh jeez. Nicely done. Who's first? Wait, let's just hold on. I'll go in with darkvision without setting off any lights that might herald them. Then I'll get hurt. I don't see anything inside here. Looks like there was a broken lamp, so careful with fire. Yeah. I'll push in a little bit more. Looking up? Do I notice any furniture, articles, clothing? 17. I believe Cali. Not that I can see. Not any danger in the chamber, but it looks like there's more to this room. Could've been. Nott Bren, you're up. Yep. By yourself. Brackish flesh? Gross. Well, only one place to go and that's down. Yeah, sure. I like what I'm hearing! Shark fins and shit?! I'm a happy camper. We're going to find out how far. Double knot. It is kind of enclosed. I like that idea. We're good to fuck them up, I think. No, I don't think that's a good idea. I could blind them. What? I'm not half fish, I'm half-orc! That is actually not true at all. Nott, not at all. Half-human, I'd assume. MARISHA and Once. Right now? 13. 18. Do what you're going to do. I'm going to run around the corner. Give me that right over here. Yeah, so I can see all three of them, at least. 'Sup, fish-fucks! (laughter) Aren't y'all pretty? I look. In the space in between them, I see this ripple start to form, and I reach out with my hand, and I'll grasp at the space and tear a rip in reality, and I'll cast Hunger of Hadar, ripping this 20-foot dome on the ground. I'll put it right here, so it's-- Actually? No, I'll stick it right here. Yeah, because it halves it, makes it difficult terrain, so let's put it right there. Ish. Only if they start in it, or if they end their turn in it. Two different types of damage. Well, actually, it says the void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers. No light, magical, or otherwise, can illuminate the area of the 20-foot sphere-- It's just within the sphere they're blind. They take 2d6-- Each of them. Do I roll that? Five, four. Nine points of damage each. Cold. (impacts) Tentacle beating! And they're in difficult terrain, so it's halved. Yeah, you just send whatever you've got in the sphere. Trying to keep them in one spot. At the end of their turns, they must succeed on a dexterity saving throw-- Oh, sorry. My fault. 17. That hits. I have to make a constitution saving throw to keep the spell. Okay, strength save. Nine. What do I have to make? I forget. 23. That hits. Natural 20. That is a six and a one, so seven points of acid damage. Yeah, it's a sphere of darkness with stars with milky tentacles whipping around. That's what it says. What happens to the harpoon and the cord sticking out of me? I appreciate it (pained sounds). I'm going to hug this wall if I can, back up a little bit, and I'm going to hold Eldritch Blast if I see them emerge from the darkness. I'm scooching! Two, three. Five points of cold damage. Yeah, they both. 21. I don't know, I can't add this fast, my app's breaking. 13. 17. I go unconscious. I use my Relentless Endurance to pop back up to one. 19 plus all that. I'm super strong. Where the fuck is it? 14. It's like a dock on a Tuesday morning. At disadvantage? 16 doesn't hit. He's throwing in the dark in the direction where two guys, and he's threading them and hitting me? Fair enough. Unconscious I go. Don't worry if I sink. I have that armor. It's a life preserver, guys. Throw me a Bud Light. Thanks, Jester. Oh god! What's wrong with Beau?! (thuds) Ugh! Mike Myers. Flurry of Beaus. I'll use half my speed to stand upright. And I'll unleash two Eldritch Blasts at that-- That's a 26. And that's cocked. Reach for the sky! And an 18. Six points of damage on the first one, and 14 points of damage on the second one. I stand up. I get to my feet. I touch the wound area and I fire it across the way. We can deal with tempers. Somebody help me check these crates. Do they have any rune-ish markings on them or anything like that? We treat guests so well! Are there any weapons that the merrow dropped? The hook or the spears? Or were they tridents or anything? I pick up one of the tridents. Does it seem like an average-- Plus, some of us can swim. We could pop down real quick and see what's down there. Anyone else feel like going for a swim? LAURA and Yeah, pretty decent. No. Sure, we have an extra 50 feet, we didn't really need the rest. Yeah, but I mean, we're fine. Let's do it. Yeah, I'm going to go down, and if I start running short on air, I'll come back up. No, you don't need to do that. There's no need, Jester. We'll take a short rest afterwards. Just a quick little recon. I drop the rope and jump in. This is college all over again. 21. Six. I'll take a big breath, blow it all the way out. (inhales deeply) Go back under, push back. What's the depth like as I'm going through? So I can see the bottom? That's not so bad. Yeah. There's another room. There's five more of them, if I remember. Yeah, there's a whole other cavern. There's ruins and objects and all sorts of stuff. We're not done with this by a damn sight. There were so many things. There were crates and objects. Could be underneath it. We could guard this entrance and rest up for a bit, get ourselves together and carry through. It's not that far. I think everybody could make it. I certainly could help somebody if they're not a very good swimmer, but-- We could. I know there are five, but I think we use this funnel point as a fatal funnel, right? We make them come through one at a time. We send some bait, bring them back through, but only when we're ready. What do you think? Cali? Sure. Are you natural Beau or big-ass Beau? Cali, I'm just curious. You don't want to try and smash it on the ground real fast? Just for shits and giggles. Yeah, I mean, while we're all here. Yasha, chuck that shit on the side of the wall, will you? We're actually traveling all around. I was going to ask Where do you go now, since you've achieved your objective? We might find our way down to the Menagerie Coast at some point, and if we do, we'll give you a look. Strong grip. Remember, follow the daggers on the way out, they mark your way. Dram-o-mine!
