Loot Crate! That is amazing. That was the bee's knees, daddy-o! Oh snap! Hot damn! It was so much fun, getting to talk about all the shit we never actually get to talk about with other people. Is it really funny, or is it (singing) All around me are familiar faces. I'll put that one in for you on my playlist. Yes! Plurals all around. Does his companion have a name? Also 19. Yeah, baby. Ghorrix? Where's your dice jail? Come on, captain, let's go. That was strength, too? You got some bonus shit to do? I want to light this candle and get the party started! I would like to fiery rage. And can I bust out in a straight sprint towards the pit fiend? And in the immortal words of Bob Ross, "Everybody needs a friend," and I want to give him a big fucking bear hug. And I would like to try and grapple him, if I could. I can grapple a creature one size larger than myself. And I have advantage on these because I'm raging. 15, nine. 23. That replaces an attack? Can I revisit the days of the Crucible and can I try and suplex this motherfucker onto his side? I want to! Just to get him prone, also. Okay. 19. But I'm still giving him love, right? That ends my turn. That red light on Matt's face is so telling. Don't raise your eyebrows like that. Don't. No. Leave the book out. There's a rule that says you can't look at the book once your turn has started. Don't move. He can't see us if we don't move. Nope. 22. I'm going to make it a reckless attack, Great Weapon Master. On any of them. Where did he go? Oh. I didn't roll damage yet. Great Weapon Master, reckless. I waited to roll. That's better. 32 minus five is-- Okay. 36 with the Great Weapon Master. His carefree manner worries me. Was he resistant to my slashing damage? I do have a magic weapon. Holy shit! It's like the Restricted Section of Hogwarts. That was amazing. Anti-evil-people. Holy shit, aura? Not now! Aw, there's always time for lick. More than the beholder fight? He's rolling good, too! Could I ask, the roof that is underneath She-Devil Wonder Woman? How high would it be for Grog to jump using his amazing leaping things? Yeah. The boots. It is a bonus action to jump 15 feet. Boots of Feral Leaping. DC of 15, 15 feet straight in the air. Great. Could I try and run over to there, jump up on the roof, and run right underneath her? Also, can I attach the Chain of Returning to the Bloodaxe? Really?! Can I make both my attacks reckless, Great Weapon Master attacks? 17. That is probably going to hit. That is a 30 on the first one. Nope, 25. Minus five. 25 on the first one. Okay. And that's a 27, minus five. 22. Nice. Yeah, 22 was the second one. That's the wrong dice. 28 plus ten is 38 for the first one. And the second one is (counting) 27. 37 for the second one. I want to ask her name, but I don't. I'm allergic to cats. Laser pointer, Keyleth. How great is that thing? Golden snitch! Yeah, clearly. The red barrel that says TNT. Where was that shit during the card game? (laughter) Wow, two in row! Was that the studded guy? Not nice. I have advantage on both. No, strength. Natural 20. I did not do that in a gloating way, because I feel like that was very lucky. Oh, yes. Reckless and Great Weapon Master, please. That's two natural ones in a row. My yin to your yang, sir. Jesus. No, I don't subscribe to that voodoo bullshit. Hits. Wait, I have resistance to poison because of the Belt of Dwarvenkind. Okay. 21. She's got poisonous arrows! Yeah, how do you say it? She's fleeing! I don't blame you! Wait, where did she go? We could flee. Remember, we can hold until we see them, right? One of them is way up on a tower, and one is on the other side of a row of buildings from you. This is the least amount of d20s that she's ever had in that tray. Anyone staying and watching? Eating popcorn? Yeah, can I move to the tippy-top of the roof and, frustrated with my inability to follow this winged piece of shit, can I take the Titanstone Knuckles and slam them together, and enlarge myself? That's what I was hoping for, but we'll see. But I have to ask. So that ornamental thing that's above the doorway of the tower, does it look like something I might be able to make a leap, with my Boots of Feral Leaping, and start a very rudimentary climbing up the side of the tower, King Kong-style, if I wanted to try and get up to where she is? Or would I be better suited jumping down? It says 15 feet straight up, or 20 feet horizontally. Bonus action, that's it. If I fail the DC, I fall prone. Cool. Well, go big or go home. I'm going to try and jump towards the tower and grab onto that ornamental fixture that's just above the doorway. Okay. Well yeah, in essence, I would like to jump towards the tower. If it goes better than I thought, then awesome. 21. Could I use my movement to Crossfit my way up? (panting) Hold on, I need a breather. Naw, I'm just fucking about. You're dead. Can I go into a frenzied-- no, that was my bonus action, so I get two. Can I do reckless, Great Weapon Master, two attacks on She-Ra? 21. Whoa. Do I know if she can do that again? Right, kitten's got claws. I'll make the second one reckless, but not Great Weapon Master. I already said it was, should I do it again because I said it? All right, fine. 31. Minus five, 26. Hey, she didn't do it again! Yahtzee. One point of necrotic, 26, plus ten is 36. Yeah. I'm a little attracted to the fact that she parried my first one. I'm kind of confused. Plus, you know, we're up high in the air, and the city's on fire. It's very romantic. That's it, that's my turn. I should ask her her name, you know. I'm going to be right on her in a second. Touch yourself, Taliesin. Let the man fly. I think that misses. No, no, no, I am really a nice guy, when you get to-- Get the fuck over here. Reckless, great. I'm going to give this a 29 minus five, is a 24. Five points of necrotic, (adding) 38. Oh, oh, oh! Enlarged. 39. Pike's next. I mean, Pike is after you. The harmony on that was-- But she's further away. Give up and run away. That d8's very exciting. Have you been hit? No. As a result of the-- Why does no one want to stay and play with me?! Can I step up on the ledge, like an assassin from Assassin's Creed, attach the Chain of Returning to my axe, and throw it at the back of the pit fiend? Reckless! But not great weapon master. 24. Right. Four points of necrotic, 28. Oh, plus I'm enlarged. 29. Well, I'm not going to do any good up here. I still have my movement, right? I'm going to try some stupid shit. Since the axe is in his back, can I Indiana Jones down to the ground? (singing Indiana Jones theme song) Just, (yelling) trying to get down to the ground or underneath him. I may hit the ground, but maybe it will be slowed by the--? I understand. Not great. Nine. (yells) It's not like an embankment down to the lava, right? It's just a river of lava, right? It's like a hidden Mario level! That's bad? I'm just going to do the T2 as I sink into the lava. I mean, I stood in lava before, with Gern. It didn't hurt that much. 63, thank you. Yeah, that's a good move. That mace sucks all the balls. I love that that's her unofficial name. Announce yourself, woman! Thing! Whatever! Right, not that I don't love being in this river of liquid magma, could I get out, please? Can I use Stone's Endurance? 26. So what's-- Thank you for doing the math for me. Yeah, yeah. Toward everybody else, where all the danger is. The fun zone. Now, I have a question. Around this way. What I would like to try and do is, as I get out of the magma, seeing Pike unconscious is the worst. If I try and grab her, and head for the door, I have to go past the pit fiend. He'll get an attack of opportunity on me. If I'm cradling her, does he get one on her as well? All right, I would like to pick up my buddy Pike and make like hell for the door. All right. Oh, Pike! I got lots of potions. Pikey! (voice cracking) Don't do that to us, Pike! Just for the sheer limerick. Yeah, but it's vibrating. I think you should just put it away. Maybe offer him the Mythcarver to leave us alone. With advantage! On the pit fiend? Are you serious? I cannot believe it. I cannot believe it. Yeah, but the Vestige got used! I never knew! Yeah, mansion. Mansion. Can I poke my head out the mansion and see who's still outside? I look around. Is Scanlan still outside? Pardon me, Master Australia. The slaves need hosing down. And I retreat inside the doorway. 13! Plus one. I would join him so I can grab the mallet, the mace that the pit fiend had. Unless it turned to ash as well. Too large for me? What about the rope she had? The lasso? I healed up to 168. Oh god! Do you read that slow all the time? They'd essentially be grappled. It can be destroyed. It has 20 hit points and an AC of 20. Is it limited by the size of the creature? I can't restrain a fire giant? Hello. It wasn't bad. It was only a couple minutes. Better than L.A. [static] Go on, Vex. See what they want. Respect. I think I might be that many. No. Yeah. Shit, I'll drink to that! I take the jug and I stick my face in. I go Beer! It makes four gallons of beer. It makes four gallons. I'm a big guy. Nasty! I'm not. We were super stealthy as requested. No! She's Pike. She's hardcore. I don't know. Perfect. (high-pitched) Oh, beautiful brass scrolling and priceless-- Don't read the whole thing. It's up to Ashley if she wants to. She's getting it right now. You look awesome, Pike. Is it actually hotter in that armor? Are you sweaty in there? Oh, that's not the best part. If they hit her, they take damage. That is amazing. Daxio. Yeah. I'd button it up. I don't think that meant we're going to leave the Fire Plane before we settle the favor that he constantly reminds that we owe him. The mansion is still up, isn't it? Yeah, but then we put it in his court when he shows up. Favors. Let's go get Senokir. It would be an honor. "Sure." Better be a 40 or higher. Well, I can, because it was a four. Vasselheim. I do hate to pry, but how long ago did your wife pass? You have our condolences. Not anymore. You're saying it in front of all of us. That's what I wanted. One last laugh. Yeah, just do it. How long was I gone? Bye!
