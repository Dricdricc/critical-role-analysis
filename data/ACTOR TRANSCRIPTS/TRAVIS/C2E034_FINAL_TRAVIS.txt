Oh yes. No! Yes. Okay, look. Listen, man. It's nothing personal, it's just last week's spot was a little rough, and we needed to have a safe, non-offensive spot this week. Oh yeah? Did you write something for tonight? Did it involve fart sounds? Offensive stereotypes? Cursing? Violence? Inappropriate uses of pickles and/or cucumbers? You can't be trusted, dude. Listen. Read what we wrote for you there. It's a hundred percent safe, non-offensive. The jokes are approved, so go ahead. Even better coming out of your mouth. Yeah. Come on. Wrap it up. Let's go. Can we switch him after the intro? Max did really good at getting through that, by the way. You can add paper once you write too big, like you do? Nice. Wow. (gasps) It's a lie! Shank! I got her! I took care of her! I'm so happy! Life goals. Yeah, Taliesin! Double guns! Fucked up. I've never seen a-- I mean, I've seen one, but I've never spoken to a-- Yeah. Is that an eye patch? Yeah. Yeah. Who wants to talk to-- no? Nott? We're all going to fight. Oh boy. (laughs) Oh my god, fake bagpipe sound is best bagpipe sound. (laughter) What is your name, friend? You better skip back! Well of course. My name is Fjord. You say it's been a few months since your last passage on a ship. Steady work? Did I? (grunts) Stay away! Stay away! Southern accent! Trying to Texas, Georgia, Louisiana! (laughter) We're looking for an individual that might frequent these parts. Half-elf gentleman. You seen anyone named Sabian in these parts? Have you not been on a ship because of a lack of opportunity, or if the right situation presented itself you would be perhaps up for a bit of work? Oh shit. Do you frequent spots outside of this particular establishment or is this your shithole of choice? Fucking talking cow over here. It was great. Yes. This tortle must survive at all costs. Are we in agreement? The other folks in the tavern-- there are only five? Four or five? Is she giving us a quizzical look, a suspicious look, an interested look? That sucks balls. Four. Yep. Don't know if I care. I'm going to go over to her. That's where the guy that's causing the problem is, but it seems super complicated. Oh my god. Couldn't help but notice we seemed to have caught your eye. I apologize. Clearly my friends and I are new in town, and we are very inquisitive. What is that you're drinking? (whispering) Am I slipping? I can't help it! I can't not do it! Yeah, would you care for more? I'll wave to the barkeep to bring another round over. For her. Most expensive wine. If you wouldn't mind, we were moving through the town, and there is this tower right in the middle of it. The Tide Peak, I believe it's called in my notes. Can you tell me, do you know anything about that? Such a strange structure. Indeed. Oh, a fellow sailor. Indeed. Not for some time, I'm a bit out of practice, but yeah. Oh, I'm quite a strong back. Good with rigging, topsail. You name it, I've done it. Oh, I didn't quite make it up past making the crew. I'm afraid higher duty didn't quite suit me. Could be. Do you have work? I might stop by. Where is your ship? Drensala Vis. Your ship? Beautiful. This is my accountant, Caleb Widogast. Very intelligent, good with books and numbers. You know how valuable it is to be a jack of all trades. I've tried some things in the meantime while I've been landlocked. Fjord. Just Fjord. The pleasure is all ours. When are you planning to cast off? It was nice meeting you. Just curious, you don't happen to have any members of your crew by the name of Sabian, do you? The name sound familiar? Cadmus, you said? The name rings a bell. A few months, you say? Does the name ring a bell? Because it's a dope-ass name. Oh, that's better. 18! Motherfucking pirates The Widow's Embrace Because it's another good name. Have we heard this name before? Just a good name. Fuck. Damn you and your good name and character creation. Slow it down, man. Fucking us up over here. Giving us alternate dimensions and shit. An old friend of mine. I owe him some money. If you happen to see him, let him know that Fjord was looking for him. Oh, I'm sure it's nothing too savory. He's had terrible judgement in the past. I'll turn over my shoulder. Yeah! (cheering) Yeah! Revoke your travel status! Never leave again! Okay, cool. You can summarize it; it'd be fine. In the water? You don't have to tell us. He's getting the cork. You may be in luck. We just met a captain of a ship, not two minutes before you walked in. Yeah, that happened. Has all our blood. What's in the sack? Gross. We didn't really get to explain. You were the last to wake up of the three of us, and by the time you came around, we had met Mr. Clay. He apparently worked in a graveyard? Cemetery? I want to get it right. Oh, fucking shit. He makes tea out of dead people. I know. Like it sounds. How did the vision of these islands come to you? The Stormlord? You commune with the Stormlord? The Stormlord? That's significant. We have missed you; we don't mean to pry. Interact with that fucking weasel. Tide Peak. It's midday. This guy's like, "Fucking money tourists." Nott, why don't you get up on a table and get everyone's attention and ask the room if they know anything about Algar? Everybody, your attention please! (claps) Every fucking last one of you! We've threatened them with goblin tactics! I love that monologue. Midnight. LePual. I mean, it couldn't hurt to do a drive-by and just see if we could see anything. I thought they were, too. I thought the entrance was underwater. Well, yeah, everybody can swim... Are you strong enough to pull us up? Got to start somewhere. Yeah, but I mean at least if we're heading towards the docks where the entrances are, I'm sure more people in that area will know-- Should I secure us a rowboat? Pretty sure I can. Is there a ship shack, or something that would lease vessels? It's an official term, guys. 13. Old timer! I'm sorry to bother you, I don't see a mariner's office around here. Is that your rowboat? Fjord. Jimmy. Absolutely. Little bit, little bit, my friends here were hoping to explore the coast a bit. And if I could put some coin in your pocket, I was wondering if you would mind parting with your vessel here for a little bit. Tales of the worst greenhorns you've ever worked with. That is most kind of you, we are much obliged. Is it big enough for all of us? Actually, that's not a terrible idea. I was going to volunteer to be pulled by-- It's tied up to the dock. Caleb seems very comfortable. Since it only fits a few folks, I-- No, you have to come with. I was going to volunteer to trail behind; the armor helps. Oh, that's right! What? You get smaller? What do you mean? Is that a Disguise Self thing? Does it change your physical weight and stuff? Oh, it is a firbolg thing! Well, fuck, that's awesome! I think you'll be fine, actually, if Jester and I are trailing behind. Some people aren't scared of the water, Nott. It's actually quite safe. Look, Nott. And I reach down into the water and touch it with my hand. There is absolutely noth-- (yells). I just fall right into the water. Just churning bubbles and stuff. I pop back up. See? Totally fine. You'll never know. Have you been here a few days already? Oh. Well, somebody's got to ask if anybody has any idea where the entrance to the-- The entrance? I'm in the water with you. I'm covered in armor. Okay. Price of a good joke, I'm afraid. Are you knowledgeable about the entrance to the Sluice Cove? Sluice Weave? Well. Thanks. Yeah, he was telling the truth. Because I know sailors. Why don't you threaten him with a trove of goblins around the wharf while-- Is there anyone else on the docks? Anyone else that we can see? Are there any crownsguard-- or I'm going to say zol-eezzo? Zolezzo, thank you. Hey Beau! You know those people skills we've been working on? You want to ask the zolezzo if they mind telling some tourists about the fabled entrance to the Sluice Weave? Okay. Ooh, good, yeah. Okay. Yep. You're going to use your real name? Try something else. You don't look like a Julia. Sure. Better. Totally Tracy. Yep. Okay. You know this person, don't you? This is somebody you've met. That is very observant. Yeah. Do that. Yeah, but you don't have hair on the side of your head, so. (laughter) Yep. Give it the old-- Yeah! Fierce. Yep. I like it, go with it. Bruises on her arms. Old busted lip scars. Come on, baby. We're all just aghast. Just like-- Oh my god. This cake needs more layers, girl! Don't write that down. Where did that come from? Let's go. An octopus? We're getting into the water and we'll just either hold on to the back, or if we have rope on the dock, I'll just tie four foot-- There you go. Yeah, we're literally back here as a safety net, so don't fret. Beau? Point us in the direction that your boyfriend alluded to. In the water? (garbled) Go fuck yourself. While he's doing that, can I pop my head underwater and look around, just make sure there's no-- anything coming around? 17. Go Yasha. Go Yasha, go! 40 down, 40 across, 30 up. I think that's a good place to start. However, if you wanted to test your strength I would be very careful! Remember it was an intake, so you could get down there and all of a sudden the suction and the water would make it very difficult for you to back out. I'm just saying it could be unpredictable. It could turn on, turn off. Okay, who is going down? Yeah it does. What about the damn puppy? Beau's holding onto a lead line. Big breath. (deep inhale) I'll take it. Oh shit, really? Fuck! Did not think that was going to work. Damn! David Blaine up in this bitch. Make a summer home underwater. My swim speed is my regular speed. I'm staying at the mouth with the other end of the rope. You guys are going in. That's why I'm at the mouth of the-- They can just come up it, yeah. Yeah! Since I saw them go up, I'm going to swim forward to where I saw them disappear, and seeing the grate gone, I'm going to come back out and make my way up towards the boat to let them know they made it through. Yeah, they made it through the second grate. Oh, why am I even coming back? (inhale) (splash) The bottom rope is tied to the bottom so if you tie the rope to the boat, you got yourself an anchor or a moor. Yeah! Yes! Break through that shit! Woo! (creepy voice) Try it, you might like it. Yeah! (laughter and cheers) We got to get rid of them at some point! Let it happen! Let it happen! (laughter) It's cocked as fuck. Yeah, that's okay. No, don't do that, the dog will die. You brought the dog? Where's Caleb? That'd be bad. It's only about a foot and a half across, right? Thunder queens. As they're looking, I'll just creep towards the pillar and cautiously peek around. Yep. Is it? No, that would have passed by now because it's past midday, right? Is it spheres? Oh jesus, wide at the bottom, thin at the top. 16. 16. Nice. Release the Spiritual Weapon! Yeah, I'll move up to this northeastern corner up here. Turning and seeing the-- Okay. I'll throw two Eldritch Blasts to this creature behind Caduceus. Two attacks. First one is 13. Just hits. I'll roll the second one, well fuck. That's 12. Gotcha. Fuck you. Five points of damage. That is my turn. Nein. (as Beau) I feel alive! Is that a strength check? Did you make it with advantage? You're raging. I got you, boo. (deep voice) Hey, shorty. Can I approach the water fuck that's on Mr. Clay? And I will use Booming Blade against it. Advantage? Amazing. It's cocked. Natural 20. (cheering) So at 5th level it deals 2d8 thunder damage to the target. Four. Yeah that's it, that's just 2d8. So eight points of damage. Booming energy, yes. Yes. Nasty! Water on water violence. And booming energy. So when he moves he takes an additional 2d8. Nine points of booming damage. (impact noise) You're doing it! How do you spell the first word of that spell? Unfortunately. Hard water. Roll your extra thing. Yeah. See? No big deal. Water's your friend. Are there any drains on the floor as we walk around? 14. Caleb, didn't you want to explore that smaller tunnel? It's a real small tunnel. I'm not looking to Shawshank my way down that thing. I am not. I am actually quite stocky, thank you very much. Yeah. I am ripped to fuck. So many. Perhaps we should continue. Where does this tunnel go? Yasha, you do it. Nothing treacherous? We looked around for writing and stuff, but. No. God, no. We keep going. Yep. I'll take the front, with my darkvision. I know we didn't! We move on. Yeah, you stank. More balcony terraces? How deep did the water look? I could get up there. Can we move to the mouth of the room? So still within the tunnel, not going into the full space yet, but able to see in and up. Plus ten? 26. Guys, our NYC live show! East coast, come bring it! Boston, Massachusetts. What is the distance from where we are to the terrace balcony space that they're on? This is dope, man! Yeah! It's so worth it. We're not in the room, right? 21. Oh no, I'm just repeating what Nott said. I don't know why I did that. 16. It goes Nott, Beau, Caduceus, Fjord, Yasha. I know I'm 16. Yasha's 15. Nice! I got you. That we can tell. We don't know. No, we fucking know you do. Oh! If your finger gets cut off I'm going to-- We got fog smoke! It's the little things, people! So worth it! You keep putting him in the mix. Five. Not everybody, just in that line. 20 feet away? Two zero? Okay. I'm going to try some shit. Can I use my 30 feet to run by this creature to this area? Okay. I'll take it. Did you roll to hit? 13 points, got it. Okay, so. Would you say that's about 30 feet to here? All right. Grasping the falchion, I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Misty Step and try to (fwoomp). I appear on the platform. I look around and say, hey kids, you just fucking couldn't "leave well enough alone. And I'll take the falchion and I'll shove it in the ground and cast Thunder Step! They take 3d10 damage and this cacophonous thunderous boom. No, Thunder Step. And I jump 90 feet in any direction. I didn't? Oh, phew. I want to land on this platform over here. Yeah, it's a constitution 15, is the save. 15 for the save, and 19 points of damage. I did something! He does. Yeah. Yeah, they just take damage. Yeah, that's it. Oh, thanks. I'm so happy! Did he take any damage? No he didn't-- oh, he took half damage. Arcane hype! Oh my god. A Hans and Franz. Algar succeeded, you guys. That's twice. Read it, Sam, what's it say on D&D Beyond? He ain't stepping out in high fashion. (quietly) That's Yasha. Good try! Oh, shit! It's one foot of water, you probably fell on your back. God damn it! Yeah okay, I'm a little shook, it's cool. I'm going to use my speed to just peek in the doorway. Just to get a visual on the hallway. I don't actually need to see them. I'm going to use my last of two spell slots to cast Hunger of Hadar 20 feet into the hallway with just the brim-- just so it gets the-- yeah. So I pop in the doorway, and I reach up and grab a little bit of reality, and I tear a black hole in the hallway. Yup. You ain't going nowhere, motherfucker! Everything in it is black. So they're blinded, they can't hear anything. 15 dex save or they take 2d6 cold damage. Six, seven, so seven points. Yep. Algar does? Yeah! Nope. Yes-- Yeah, I'm going to use the rest of my movement to just come back out here. Like the flowers she collects. Nice. Every little bit counts. We don't? I don't think he was clear on that. And when you drown, do you then have three death saves or-- Or are you dead? Or just two rounds in. For two more rounds. Dude, I was sweating. I forgot something. When Algar starts his turn you take 2d6 cold damage. So he was-- Yeah. He'll be at two instead of one. I did. 2d6? For both of the bodyguards? Five points of acid damage. Sorry, full damage. Full damage. They do take-- if they do their dexterity saving throw they take half. Again. It says that if you-- Yeah. Their speed is halved. It's a big ass sphere. Yeah. Nope. Nope, just blind. E'rrybody blind. Okay. Oh! Nice. He's currently face down in the water. Agency breakup. Yeah! That's mine! That's me. Don't go in there. I mean homie is right next to you. Well, he going to hurt you. Reckless? You can do it every turn. In the belly of the beast. Ooh, by one. And cold damage hurts more? Oh yeah, sorry. 16. Oh, right. That's a natural 19 plus four. Do we get knocked back by the jets? So would dropping Hunger of Hadar be an action? You just drop it. Okay. I'm going to use my speed to enter the hallway. Five, ten, 20 before I get to the thing. Do you need to get out of waterfuck? You know what? Fuck those guys! I'm going to stay right where I am, where I can still see the water thing and I'll send two Eldritch Blasts toward the water where Clay is. I don't give a fuck about Algar. No. Okay, because you're in it. But if I hit the wave it'll hit them. Let's-- Let's not do that. I'm going to drop Hunger of Hadar and I'm going to send two Eldritch Blasts at both of the bodyguards. That is a 12 for the first one. And 16 on the second one. Nice. That is ten points of damage. Five, ten, 15, and I'll use the rest of my 30 feet to get as close as I can. Yeah. Yes. Yep. I have a question for you after her turn. Let's think about what's important here. I have a question. So it says no action, when you slay a humanoid you can cause its spirit to rise as a specter that gains three temporary hit points? It says no action. Once a long rest. So can I do that for the bodyguard that I just slayed? I'll just reach forward and say Let none pass. I didn't know it was going to do that. Do not move. (high-pitched) Come back to the water park. Yes! Yeah. Fucking True Lies. (explosion) No, the Szundie. Fuck. Ooh, yeah. You should just kill him because he's never going to work again. What is there to live for? "Ooh, that's a good roll." Not what you want to hear. I look down at Algar and say, I'm only going to say this once. Unless you want to end up like your friend here, I'm going to need that bracelet. I'm going to cut his hand off and take the bracelet. No, I'll take the bracelet off. I'm going to cut his hand off! (cheers) With advantage? This will be fine. 17-- that's even better. 21. Drift up towards us? Not if I put that fucking slap bracelet on!
