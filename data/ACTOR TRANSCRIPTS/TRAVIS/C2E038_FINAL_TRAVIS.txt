All of Australia is turning off. No, that's not a familiar. Vegepygmy is a familiar? You got it, pick one! Grung. Manshoon! Lou Albano. Gran Metalik. Benadryl. (singing) Welcome to the jungle! I'll be up front. Yep. She's nice in the middle for a good spread. First roll with the new CR die! Do you do that out loud? The local greenery? I don't need it, but okay. 25. Caduceus, can I ask you what do you hear when you converse? (whispering) Yeah, I'm sorry. No. Nothing. Oh. Yeah, and Caduceus please. What the fuck? Plus? Why are you rolling perception checks? Yeah. Caduceus, Nott, want to check it out? Yeah. Such a good idea. Just think, slot machine! Ding ding ding ding! (hissing) Save friends! This is good. This is some Uncharted shit right now. What golden snake? Is it just a cobra head by itself, or is there also a body? Yeah, we can take ten minutes, we'll set out a little perimeter just to make sure we deflect any unwanted-- Huh? Why would we do that? You certainly could. I don't see what harm it could bring. Sure, go for it. He's rolling dice, you guys. Is the shack large enough to house our entire? We'll kind of-- I have a question for you, Matt. Is it really just us and Avantika and Jamedi? And that's it? Yeah, that's the humidity. I walk over to Avantika and say Might I ask, you said your men are dedicated to this cause as well. How much do you share with them? Very effective. Blind belief is quite remarkable. I'm assuming you've shown them things to garner some level of expectation of your abilities? I don't doubt it for a moment. I would expect nothing less. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. She just gets a finger full of sweat. Are we satisfied? All right. I'll take it. Is that advantage? Better. 21. And sweet. Of the what? What the fuck? You slick motherfucker. Really? Out of the fucking blue. Just make one. 20. Somebody cast something, right? Does that mean somebody cast something? I'm sorry, did you say not quite-- Do you detect anything sinister? Yeah, that's inherent, sure. Right. Thank you for letting me know. I hope you'll keep an eye on it for us. All right. No, I asked if she shared with her men her passions and all the details that she knows and all the knowledge. I thought maybe she might covet that, but it seems like she's quite forthcoming. She's trying to build a following, like a zealot almost. You know, build believers out of her crew. Yeah. She's convincing if she's a liar. I think she genuinely wants to summon forth this thing. That she's the chosen? Yeah. No, I'm fine. Fine. Rested. REM sleep is some of the best, so you know. I feel energized. Jazzed. Excited to continue on. Ghost stories? Yeah. Yep. Wow. Do you want to tell me what's in people's heads? Admittedly. Well, I admit that I'm not sure about a lot of this. No pressure, right? I will try to fill in as many details as I can. Totes. MARISHA and You can see the temperature rising. Shh! Two people go up. That's a bad gesture. We're staying put. His big arms are five feet? Like, these big-ass-- You ever seen an anaconda mouth? There are lots of teeth in there. It's real bad. Three of the other party. The other two only had eyes that seemed off? We're going to let them go. The canopy of trees above, right? There's no sort of-- It's a new day. Yeah, you make a good point. I'll join you. Anybody else? Everybody else should stay at least 20, 25 feet back. Yasha should stay with the healers for sure. The whole time! You, me, Jamedi, and Avantika in the front. Is that all right? Well, Jester, doesn't it glow? Just be dark and not attract any other attention? I think maybe we invite them in and one of us keeps out-- On who? I just peed a little. Come on, snitch! Oh my god! We got ambushed! How far away are you guys? Oh shit! That means there's probably more than two? Yeah! Why would you make that? And he is getting fucked up right now. Both our healers are outside! Typical. Nobody. Seven, plus-- I got to get her sheet. I think it's nine. Beau, Caduceus. Yasha has nine. I have eight. What? Jealous? Jealous of what? I like it! Get some of that shit back. Atta boy! It's like Avatar in the fucking-- Shit. How many hit points do you-- We are in a total danger zone, and we're taking strolls. What? On both? Wow. Yeah, Yasha will use her full movement to follow Avantika out of the bubble. The Bubl√©. Is that within melee? Great. She'll take a swipe. That is a 17. So that's 2d6 right? No, she didn't. Because I-- yep. Great, six points of damage. No! Nine points of damage. Yeah. That's 16. Oh, plus four? So six, so ten. Ten points of damage. And with her bonus action, she would like to rage. Can I use my 30 feet of movement to run that direction around the far side of the ruin? Yep. Oh shit! I'll just fire both streams of Eldritch Blast from each hand. 13. Second one. That'll hit. 23. Excellent. Nice. That's 11 points of Eldritch Blast. Nice. Great, that's it. Good rolls. Oh, the one that I've been shooting at or the closest-- Me too, right? 21. She'll make it reckless. That's right. Yeah! That's a 24. She's raging so 3d6. Nice! 14. Oh! Get it, Jamedi! Knees weak. She'll run up and take her two swipes, reckless. Yes. There you go. Yeah! You know it. That's a natural 20. Dope! That's seven, 14. She'll see it sit there, and she'll reach up high, and she'll try and cleave off the front of the jaguar's head in one downward swing. She still has one more attack, can she use the rest of her movement to move towards the jaguar? I think she has ten feet of her movement. Is that melee or just outside of it? Oh great, reckless as well. 21. Yeah! 14 points of damage. Plus three, right? Or no? Oh, thank you. Lets back it down to nine. I'll take just enough of a step back to use Eldritch Blast again and I'll fire both of them at it. Eldritch Blast, 14? Oh shit. The first one was better. 14 as well on the second one. Okay, great. (counting) 19 points. What did you do? I'll light it up with this crackling green Eldritch Blast energy coming from both of my palms, causing its fur to smoke and burn off and its snake heads to repel! I'll look over at Nott. All of us. Six. "Are you okay?" I don't know that we did; there were only two of them, and because Caleb left the bubble, it disappeared, right? We made a bit of a ruckus, that's the last thing you want to do in a jungle. Agreed. We should rally up back-to-back while Caleb casts it. I think that's a fair assumption. I still think one of us should stay up in shifts inside this bubble. Just in case. What are you doing to that poor dog? Eh, whatever. That's a high number. One ounce is good. Cool. Jesus. Let's get everything together first. Jamedi? Following you. River dancers. Yeah. [break] Ooh. Yeah, right? Okay. Pass Without a Trace. And do I still have-- no I don't. Not anymore. Do I have the thing? I don't happen to have the blessing on me? Laura! Do I have a blessing anymore? 14. Well I was going to-- You don't want to give it to Caduceus? Give it to him. Okay. There might be some leeches in this jungle. Maybe some ticks? Yeah, what is it? Give her mushrooms. Smell this. Bip. Did you get hit in the fight? And nanny fell, too. That's true! Didn't know the Incredible Hulk was in this motherfucker, did you? At the base of the structure it's doing that? Okay, so if-- I'll go over to Jamedi. If we can clear him, is the path you've taken before clear as far as you can see. I don't know which way you went? Can anyone create a distraction that doesn't put their own person at risk? It's not us, clearing, and then the building. There's stuff. Although we could throw you in a net and act like you were dinner. Who's got a net? How many of us can change? One, two, three, four. Awesome, great. Two of us, one each take, tie them up in rope-- Kind of? Yeah, that's less of what we're looking for. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. I think we should try and be as sneaky as possible. If for some reason shit hits the fan, I can make a pretty, I think, spectacular distraction that doesn't put me or us at risk. But I think we should try stealth first. Stealth, distraction, fuck shit up. Cool? Yeah. What, act like you're tied up? Yeah, we'll do it anyway. We'll tie your hands in the front. I agree. That's not a bad thought. Are there several dozen people, or is it-- Let's do that, yeah. I'll use Mask of Many Faces to look like one of those fucks and let's try to paint some scales on the non-changeling folks. Of Holding? Where are you going? Where are we meeting? At the temple? At the top? Is that a one? Shit. God-- why did you roll out that big fucker? Agreed. Nice job. He's going to fucking leave again. Good job. Indeed. I'll take out several feet of rope from the bag of holding and say We should do this before he achieves the destination. Forward. No. Well, kind of. Not really. No. I mean, I can pop in and out, but-- Yeah, that one. None. We'll put two in the front, two in the back, and put these three in the-- Good call. She'll be fine. I'll pilot her. 21. Pass Without a Trace. What? Natural one? 25. Natural 15. Describe the two again? I vote for the one guy flaying the lizardmen. Mm-hmm. And it's one guy. That never is no guys. Let's go that way. We'll go towards the flaying. Trying to blend in. If there is a building to walk beside, I would prefer to have our shittily drawn and one very nice one closest to the building with us on the outside. Mama elephants and then baby elephants. Oh god, oh god, oh god. Aww, yeah! Why? Are there any windows, doors, anything on these buildings? Can we move up to the side of one and glance in as we slow down just a little bit to peek through? No, before we get to the intersection. Do we look in the window? Ugh, seven. Keep going? All right, we'll push through. As that one turns, I'll turn to Yasha and I'll go (hisses) and punch her in the face and say, "Go down!" Stand over Yasha, take the rope, and start tying her hands together. Oh no! We're in the middle of the street. We can't tie them up. We've got to go. Yeah, we're picking up and moving expeditiously away. Yeah, or distraction. Not now. We've got to go. Do we seen anyone else around besides those two? Oh, 20. They're large beings, right? SAM, LAURA, and Yep. We're working the rope. Fuck it. I summon the sword, I run over, and I shove it into his chest. I plunged the sword into his chest. Okay, with advantage. Amazing. That is a 16? Are they automatic crits? Oh, the damage is a crit. The second one is a 23. Yeah, 23 is the highest one. Both hit, both crit, okay. 29. Out. You know what'd be great right now? A distraction. Maybe fire? It is all stone? There's no wood? There's no nothing? Let's just get out. Ceiling stone too? Out. Okay. I will point down the street away from us and go (hissing) and cast Major Image, and I will summon the image of a manticore, a large manticore roaring and thrashing in the streets. The whole shebang-- make sound, it smells, the whole thing. (shouting) Go! Yes, so he has to turn and move away from us. I can't. I point at the manticore. No, you did it. Can I take the sword and take a shot right at his wrist that's holding her? With the hand that's holding onto Jester? Okay. 17. Okay. It's going great, we're doing good. Oh, that's good! That's a 14. Yep. 13. I have Yasha's character sheet and she rolled a ten. How far is this person? Can I use my bonus action to Misty Step up behind them and I will kick them down the stairs towards the rest of us? Oh god, those used to be really great for me. 17! Oh, that's not me, jesus. I was looking at Yasha's and it was like, "When did I get Necrotic Shroud?" Let's get the fuck out of here. Yeah. In! Out of light. Out of the way. 12 for me. Natural 18 for Yasha. The top is open air? Yeah, we head towards the tablet. Of the crimson variety? Doesn't matter. Boy, sure was fun, Sam. We did! Yes, we close it, yeah. We may not have much time. Darkvision, what do we see? Time to go. You first. Check. For. Traps. Oh, shit! The big black cobra hood, arms or just the serpentine body? Taller than the other three that were in the chamber? Don't we have that little box that appears that's just counting down from ten, nine, eight, and it's going to automatically skip to the fight right now, right? We can just hit it. Yeah, but cobra fight! Good shit, Matt!
