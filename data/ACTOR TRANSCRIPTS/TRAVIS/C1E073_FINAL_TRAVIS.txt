(cheering) I can't breathe. Wow. Loot Crate! (cheering) Oh, please let something come out of your mouth. Are those Freddy Kruger chopsticks? Of all the things you thought could never be cute. Leatherface. Camp Crystal Lake. Preying Mantis man. Cat Girl. Ooh, the Walking Dead t-shirt. I call dibs on this next week! Promo code "criticalrole." Good job. Titanfall 2! You sound sexy in that, man. Just saying. High noon! That's a whole different Titanfall. Oh yeah! Telltale's Batman episode three came out. I really like the way that's going. Fun. Yes! We are super excited about this one. Starting November 15th and every Tuesday after on Alpha we will finally get to introduce Talks Machina which is our Critical Role talk show. Hosted by our amazing friend Brian Wayne Foster. You can follow him at Brian Wayne Foster something something. @brianwfoster. And you can also catch the Talks Machina page on Twitter @talksmachina. You can also get early access if you go to alphainvite.com for early access to the page. We're going to be on there; it's our chance to give insight after the game. It'll be a weekly thing so we can answer questions that people might have, talk about moments that happened, how it went well, how it didn't, how we suck. There will always be a few of us on there every week, we might even have some guests, and some segments! It's going to be awesome. It's something we've been wanting to do for a while-- Yeah. Hai! Take it off! Take that glove off! That ring better be there! Oh my god. I would be honored. He's missing so many teeth! He's a dick, he can take care of himself. I'm having trouble. Where? Where do we drop them off at? Oh. Cool. Yeah. Totally knew about that place. What if it was just a chill out spell? Did he return alone? No, no. (coughs) We did. Yeah. And you got a brilliant new sword. Wait, Kima, Kima! You don't hear anything when you use that, do you? Like voices or someone talking to you or-- No, good! Good. It's a beginner problem, but you're quite advanced. Not worried about it. Enjoy! The sword is clean. Yeah. Dodged a bullet on that one! Hide? Oh right! I'm dragging it behind me. Yeah. Right. Well, I'm off to deposit this hide! Yeah. Boy, I'm going to need to switch shoulders! Getting a little roll in the ol' righty there. (singing) Be prepared. Holy shit, that skin weighs a ton. Good thing I'm strong as fuck. What'd I miss? Is it super cold where I dropped off the hide? Like is it below ground? A bit chilly? Did we decide what we do about Raish--? Yeah. Okay, so we're not (death noises and farts)? It's open to interpretation. Yeah. Just want to be fancy. I lean that way but, you know. Cannot speak for other people. I don't know what to do. Training. This is all training. It's training at a thousand times gravity. Ew. We don't really need to like check in with anything. Well I mean I-- yeah. What? What? What? But it's really a lot to hold onto your person. I mean, it's a bag of gold-- Yeah. How much do you want? You don't have it. I have it. Yeah, if you want 5000. Do you have good credit? Yeah. Can I have your last four pay stubs, please? (laughter) Hey! That's good enough! Have 5000 gold! And it's probably about 1000 because I can't count to 5000. Are you really? Why not? But he can carry ten. That's easier. Hold on, let me consult Blackstone. Yep. Stoneblack says it's all right. I take the gold. I put it back in. And I give him ten platinum, which is actually six. One. Three. Seven. Eight. Nine. 40. Ten. Yep. It's really heavy. How about I give you 20 more platinum? And I give him four more. 50? All right. I give you one more. Preach. It's daytime, right? Is there a way I can find a courtyard or an open-air area? If I get there, are there a lot of guards keeping an eye? Can I pee in the courtyard? I feel like I need to mark my territory. This is home for us, and I peed all over Greyskull Keep. I left little puddles that y'all didn't know about. It's real important in case other goliaths come around and are like, (sniff) "Nope, the wolf's here. I got to go elsewhere." No, stealth roll, motherfucker. Can I take a leak on a wall in the courtyard? Can I find the highest wall with the most ornate decoration on it and go slightly off left? The way me member goes and make a little box right there? A little waterfall on the whitestone. Very nice. In a wide, arcing pattern, not like the one shot, like a nice, upside-down crown. Thank you. Home. How else do you spell home? That's your second luck! Yeah, don't women talk about their vaginas? Let's go Krogering! The best of everything! Do what? Ah. Well, good question. Right. It all comes down to one word, really. (clears throat) Family. Right, before I was a part of this group, I had no family. Pike took me in, I met all of you. And I had a purpose. So before that, I would be down to fuck anything up, anytime, no problem. I still kind of am. But I realized that if I fly off the handle too soon, it screws over my family. That's no good, because I care about you. Most of you. (laughter) Yeah, I promise. Deal. (cracking noise) (laughter) Oh shit, sorry! I'm so sorry! Oh, yeah. Bruises, right? No, it's cool. You make up a really good story. But listen. If at any time it gets to be too much, you just go. We've got you. You won't. You do? That's unexpected. Well-- Ow! Right, yeah. Two. Is his hate for you? We can't move it, can we? Or a weakness. I really don't, I have no idea. Oh. Anything he has nostalgic feelings about? Glintshore-- This is true. We have the Herd, we can go get the werewolves. Yeah, but it's either death now or death a little later. I agree. We should leave Whitestone. We are if we wait. Outside of Westruun? Right. Yeah, we've got to do a lot of recon before then. But I think he's got a good point, right? We've got to have like a staging point. From the other side, we'd have to go there. That's called thinking outside the circle. Is there like nothing friendly in the Fire Plane? We're in a room. What keeps his soul on this plane? Destroy the stone... Yeah, I walk over around the table towards Asum. I try and poke her in the shoulder. Him. She's not here! So we have to rally our forces to us, and we have to do some really smart recon. Do we make her a part of that or no? Can you keep him from attacking Whitestone? We don't know yet. No, I like her idea. I want to see him here. Sure you are. You are our errand boy. We are your vessel to what it is you want. So get busy, and do it quickly. After all, you're very powerful. But that changes day by day, doesn't it? One day. So Allura, so it's clear Seeker Asum is Raishan. Yeah, let's be real about it. "No tricks in this room!" (fake cough) Whiff! And she's super slippery. She just totally like evaded Percy's sneak stabby-stab. Oh yeah, Allura. Can we light your sage real quick, make sure everybody's on the up and up? Yeah. No, it's in there. You shut up, you. (laughter) I feel totally fine. She evaded it really easy. I agree. I agree. Our play is the finish line. That's it. Not a moment before. Sidebar. Do we have all the Vestiges that the sphinx told us about? What else is there? I know I'm not the smartest one in the group, but we don't know what the fuck we're talking about with this little sphere. Why don't we go find that last Vestige and see what it turns up? Well, I can. Kima might. I'm not much for poetry, but it seems sort of poetic that Thordak came from the Fire Plane, and the last Vestige we're looking for is in the Fire Plane. Well, so was the Feywild, and we didn't-- That's basically all of our choices at this point. A regular creature or a Feywild creature? Do it! Oh my god, do it! Wait, if you like conjure it outside and walk in, is it going to go poof and disappear? What's going to squeal? Touch it. Just go do it! Just do it! Yeah yeah yeah, go touch it. She meant what she said. Do it. Fucking do it. You don't speak Sylvan. Well, hold on. Wait. What was the biggest thing you put in there? Probably. (chanting) Fire Plane. I third that. Fire Plane. Yeah, we're not going to see her. That's like saying I farted because my stomach hurt, and then I found out it stunk as well. Cool. Fort Daxio then? Check it out? Are you saying you want Raishan to go with you one-on-one so you can do the Melora thing, and then maybe you take her out? And you want a shot at it before we try anything else? Because I'll grant you that. Yeah. Rare spell, that. Yeah, no, we got that. So does anybody want to do anything else before we go to Daxio? Wolves are on another plane. Herd is wandering. Yeah, that's fair. Let's put one foot in front of the other first, shall we? Yes, I approve. Yeah. (chants) Dax-i-o. Dax-i-o. What was under that blanket? No, we know you did. We should have him walk down the street and take bets on how long it takes him to get arrested. (laughter) It's cool. I have an internal timer, and if you don't meet it, I'm going to kill all your people. (laughter)
