Peaced out. Devil's advocate. What if she's lonely, and two, what if she's not the hag and she knows where the hag is? I'm just saying you're profiling, is all. I take out the javelin of lightning. I do. And I, I just make sure that it's clean and put it back. Yeah, we've gotta at least come back this way, so, you know. We go around. Stealthily. Do we still have Pass Without a Trace? Don't tell me what to do, devil-woman. Javelin or Dust of Tracelessness, they go together. If I do one, I do the other. I need a little danger in my life. There's a giant werewolf following us... I didn't really hit it that much, it was very unsatisfying. (All laugh.) Did you say Pass Without a Trace? They switched, yeah. 25. Pass Without a Trace. Hide! I hide. Fuck. She's out here now. Something you said. (laughs) Can I look for Ukurat? A gigantic 11. That sounds accurate. Who are these people, like, (gasps). Easy there, tiger. Don't shoot any trees. Yeah, Pimps-a-lot, you wanna? Okay. Can I smell the black stuff on him? Yeah, in the summer? I know that exact, accurate smell. You smell terrible. How about you, I'll put you on my shoulder, but how about you sit on my shoulder like strapped back there and just hang out the back? No, don't put your feet near my face, like hang out on the back of me. No worries. I'm flipping and climbing vines and shit. Lead the way. Oh yeah. Troll dick. Yeah. They're huge. Yeah. Hey, Percy. I'm not scared of trolls. How high are the lowest branches? You wanna lift? I'm not going up. You think my giant ass is gonna jump frockily-fucky-fucky from branch to branch in the treetops like some kind of acrobat? No! No. Can I put my back against a tree? A large tree. I turn around. The trees talk. I spin around again and put my back to this tree. Oh. I might be down with being some kind of monkey. Gorilla. Nimble as shit. No. No. Grog. Ah, shit. Gorillas can't-- But I do this with my foot. (All laugh.) I'm gonna-- can I? (gorilla noises) (gorilla noises) That still translates, right? Yeah, I'll stay down here as bait. Anime shit. What's the modifier for king of the apes? That's a 20, 12 plus eight. 21. Not so great. 23. We don't have the mansion, right? (gorilla noise) Like ghostbusters. Can I check myself for parasites? How do I not become a gorilla anymore? I look at Keyleth and I go-- I'm on the ground? My pants are down, as my hand was behind my bottom, just contemplating flinging some poo. Hi guys. It didn't, don't worry. I've got a question. Can one of us that can turn into things go in the muck? I mean, I'll go in and-- Yeah? What are you gonna turn into? You really don't think that's-- All right, I'll try. I frenzy raged last time. Don't worry about it. Yeah, 19 and 16. 24. I'm sick, don't make me laugh that hard. That's good. Whoa whoa whoa, I'm sure you want to test the gunk, right, Percy? Is it flammable, is it poisonous, is it acidic? I take a pinky-smear-- Like a droplet, right, I stick my tongue out, and I touch it to my tongue. I detect a note of digestive tract. I raise my hand-- no. I gotta leave, I can't-- I can't be here when this happens. Oh my god. Did we take a long rest or just a short rest? I'm going into the kitchen with the Titanstone Knuckles, and I'm gonna start hitting things. Well, I wanna see if I can upgrade the knuckles, so I'm gonna start using them. Yeah. (punching sounds) Don't forget the holes in the wall. I'm trying to activate these, and they require pain. (yells) Do I notice any difference in the gauntlets? At disadvantage? One less. Ten. Maybe I need to hit people. Would you? How many? How many can I have? I go into the next room. With the dozen servants. What if a change happens, don't you wanna be there? Please. Grog always leaves his mark. I pick up one of the servants by the head and I try and crush his head. Make yourself grabbable. Fix this. You fix this now. I will break more stuff. I punched the cow before. I grab again. I grab again. I grab again. I grab again. Fine, fine. Bring me a cow. No, no, no. It's time to ring this bell. I beat the shit out of the cow. (All groan.) It's a purple, like, ethereal cow. I'm gonna rocky ribs the shit out of this cow. Okay. Are you sure? Is this my day-birth or something? Yeah. Rage-punching. (All singing Jurassic Park theme.) Do I feel anything? I could. There's one number lower. (All laugh.) No. Being disappointed. Yeah, come get it. Come get it. (grunts) Nothing? You're only gonna do it once? Nah. Do one more, but like, angry-sing. (yelps) These things don't work. What are we doing wrong? Have we looked for instructions? Is there writing on the Titanstone Knuckles? Carvings. Thanks, man. I'm gonna long rest now. We'll plan at dawn. What do you think that is? Like a giant werewolf maybe? Tree's not missing. Can I roll some hit dice to heal up? Your shoes suck. You didn't ask me to make the boots. In the Feywild? Don't know who you pissed off... Grass. I mean, the sphinx did say that the bow is the heart of a cancerous tree, I think if we're expecting to not find the tree, we're stupid. I am the wrong one to ask. Why don't we poison the tree? Abba music. I also have poison. Oh. What about honey? I got honey for you. No. I mean, I can make some water if you wanna bless it. (laughs) By yourself? Let me tell you a tale of two people that went inside a dragon. Can we hurt the tree? You're just giving the broom away now. Just saying. Sweet. I love having a character who can't read. No pressure. Is that like an elven word? Keyleth. Did you ask if the tree was just one thing? What if we, like, salt the earth? That's an expression. I have 12 gallons of salt water. I've heard them say it before, they're like, oh, you are the salt of the earth. What's on the other side of this tree? It's huge, it's a hundred feet. It used to be a titan that had its heart broken or something. You're gonna make me check my notes? I've got vegemite written down. Yes. Do fey creatures live a long time? What if he was betrayed by something in the Feywild, and we found that thing, whether it was a comrade or a-- Yeah, and you can talk to trees. Who betrayed it. Can't we just say that we're obsessed with the hundred-foot fucking moving tree in the middle of the Feywild? Yeah, we've come to talk to it, no bullshit. No. We wanna know what's up. Well, if he pulls any shit then we kill it. It's a mansion! We could eat somewhere else. Bare-bones. I like it. Bum-rush the tree. We put the shoes on? I'm only wearing that if it helps. I put the giant frog-shoes on. You don't think we're, like, perfectly on this tree's radar? That going stealth is insulting? I'm in the middle. Good. I take them off. We fan out. Yeah. Wait, how big is it? You said four and a half feet... Not this guy. Not normally. I'm going in, I'm going in. That's Lootcrate.com/crates. Well, I hope he's watching. We just crawled in his tree anus. How about we hit the wall? Well, he puckered up. Yeah! Oh, shit. Just so you know, your notepad is in the upper-left. 18. He's pissed. I would like to advance-- I would like to rage. I would like to advance as far as I can get towards the treant. Hey, that's cool, and I'm gonna use the chain of returning with the blood axe, and I'm gonna throw it at the tree. At Sondur. That's not great. Oh! 20 total. It was a 20 total. 24. Ahh, plus... four points of necrotic damage, for 28. 18. On Percy's and mine. But Liam did, I mean, Vax did something. Yeah, yours was surprisingly good. That does. Hits. Lightning damage? (Computer alert sound.) Halved? That's pretty awesome. 22. Rejection's a bitch. Oh, I was joking when I said it. Natural 20. It didn't catch fire. A natural retardant? Interesting, Keyleth. How high is Sondur? Liam, how much was your first attack? Can I run immediately underneath Sondur? Are there any vines that are hanging from him? There are none? Right. Are there any vines that look like they might be thick enough for me to try and climb up if I wanted to get to his height? Could I grab a few of those vines to try and climb up to where he's at? Athletics. 23. Okay. With my bonus action, can I let out the loudest howl I possibly can. (howls) That's my turn. Hits. Also hits. Misses. That's a 21. Awesome. Oh, that was so close to being a crit. That is a 33. No. That's... wait, no, that's 22 plus one point of necrotic damage, so 23. Killed him. Not so tough, really. Yes. I have a question. I forgot about Retaliation. That's a new feat I have. Oh, that's true. Hit them back. As long as I'm within five feet. That count on his two hits against me? One time. Okay. That's true. I haven't used it before. You're being so fucking nice. Love it. Over here, you piece of shit. Nope. I cough weakly. It's okay, they're all d1s. It's that hit back. (laughs) Yeah. Well, tit-for-tat, give him something else. That's unbelievable. Jesus. Thunder strikes outside the tree. I'm too big for this world. You're a greater barbarian than I am. Ukurat. It's just on that smog thing. I've been so taken out of this fight, it's driving me crazy. I'm hanging from vines, I see Wolfman come up, I'm not gonna be left out of this. Can I try and Tarzan my way over into the fray? All Yes! Just get me there, baby. Okay. With advantage. A one. Okay. And prone. That's probably more insulting. Because it fails, does that still take up all my action? All my whole thing? To get up? I'll cry a little. Do I keep my rage, because I fell and took damage? I think it has to be an attack. I'm good. Wow. Like a Molotov cocktail. Fucking Spice Girls. Cup that ball. Yeah, you've been thrown. Can you? Will he? Yeah, when it's like, when he's playing fucking Applejacks back there. All right, can I stand up? And I casually walk over so that I'm standing between Vex and Sondur, right in front of Vex, like a human shield. And I look up and I'm like, "Jesus, this is fucking stupid. I've broken some hearts in my time, but you, stupid Romeo, are taking it way too far. Guess what? NOBODY CARES." And I take the javelin of lightning and I throw it at him. (All cheer.) I do have it here. If it hits, they have to make a DC 17 dexterity saving throw. If it hits, it's a 4d6 lightning. Half if they make it. It was 24. 4d6. Nice. Six, eight, seven... 12. 12 points of lightning damage. Chasing him around the room. I know, fuck! I throw it and hopefully get it to go right in his mouth as he's trying to have a comeback. And I'll just look bewildered that it worked. I honestly did not expect that to happen. I go get the javelin, because it's obviously worth keeping. Can I run back to Vex and offer her a healing potion, unless someone can do better? Are you all right? What, become a corpse bride? It's all right. You did... you did good. I'm gonna hand her the potion anyway, as she's standing there, so. Didn't want you to miss out on all the action. Wait. What will you do now? He's so awesome. Can I try and jump through the hole like he did? I don't make it all the way in, though, do I? It's up there. Oh, good. Little colonoscopy? Can I walk over to Vax while they're making a show? Quietly, I say, What was he talking about with the bloody dagger? What was he saying about the bloody dagger when he was talking to Vex? Yes. Yeah. Well, let's not downplay the bow. Are you in fine form? Should I hit you until you-- Cool. Since I got the killing blow, can I chop this tree down now? I get to chop a tree at some point. They're already down. This is true. I could get down with that. You wanna shoot me with it? Can we get out of this fucking tree first? I walk out of the tree. Did you loot Sondur's body? Like Jurassic Park. Anybody want to climb to the top of the 200-foot tree to see what the rest of the land looks like? Nice, Sam. Hold it, Marisha. We left an empty grave inside, it's got your name on it if you don't talk. (whispers) Nice. A statue. Oh man. That was a ten. Artagan. Did you know Sondur? You don't want to see the ex? I let go. What! Got your bow! You didn't die! You don't need the Onyx Dog, why don't I hold onto that. You don't need it. We'll have to tune in next Thursday to see what it is.
