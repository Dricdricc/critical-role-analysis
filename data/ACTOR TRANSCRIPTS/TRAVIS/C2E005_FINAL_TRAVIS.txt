What a dick. (laughter) Merkin Dullbringer. Pubert Pimplepop. Filma Kraken. That's a dope jacket, by the way. Yeah, jealous. It's so good, Minxie's in there killing things. You've got a ring of power and shit. Is Beau-- is her face all jibbity-jacked, or is it pretty normal-looking at this point? Not that I watched anything from last week, because I didn't! 16. I bet she doesn't want to talk about that. That's a good shiner. Did you give as good as you got? It's got the green-yellow sunset happening, things are starting to spread. Tomorrow will be-- That trouble going to follow you as we go on our way, or do you think you're free and clear? Nice. How old are those donuts? Any lint from the bag that they were being held in? You juggling those big motherfucking swords? Is there money involved? Right, I'm sorry. Oh my god. We should what? 17. I would just like to suggest we might give way. There are six of them. We're going to kill it. But we're not walking. (laughter) Molly, feel like making some coin, doing a little bit of a show? Would you normally, you know, hijack a caravan like that? Just going off what you said earlier. I don't want to change your behavior just because you're with us all of a sudden. I am not. Merely asking a question. Wait, what does that-- If we're pointing them down, reach for the sky! Only because I have no experience in it, I was just curious what it was that you might have done, you know, previously. Fair enough. I might take you up on that, yeah. (fake cough) Beau. Oh, sorry. So generous of you. Yeah! Smash. Plus we've been traveling for what? About hour and a half, two hours now? We should probably rest the horse for just a bit. (laughter) I'll stay with you. Or falling out of it, which we would really enjoy. We were shitting in the bushes. It's impossible to believe him. Should we pull off on the side of the road and get a campfire going? Shall we collect some wood and start a fire? Anybody want to come with me to find some kindling? Shall we? All right. Go look for some dead-ish branches. Nobody. We're all going to sleep. (chanting) Caleb! Bipedal? Oh shit, what?! Yeah, there you go. Hey, what the fuck did you wake us up for, anyway? That's a joke? Yeah! Where are they? Let's go look at one. Fuck yeah! Take me cow-tipping, son! Woo! I don't know. Back in college. Yeah, let's go look at one. Shit. I'd like to, with my darkvision. 13? Well, that was worth a look. It's vaguely what I imagine a buffalo would look like. Back to sleep. For me?! Why? (shouting) Why didn't you roll a higher perception? Oh god. Oh no! Oh shit! (English accent) What are you? Watching me? My potential? What are you asking of me? Learn. What would you have me learn? Learn, grow, provoke, consume. I don't understand. A reward for this? I'm listening. Fuck. Fuck you! What were those words?! Sorry, I found a patch of strawberries. Yeah! We're fine. We're great. Just doing dandy. Yep. Of course. Sometimes it doesn't take that long, you know what I mean? (coughing) Yeah. No, I'm fine. Like a momma bird. Everybody have some of what I puked up. It's all good. Yeah, I don't think it was acid reflux. I don't know. I want to shake your hand, but at the same time, I want to smash it. I had a dream, I'm sorry. A vivid one. Just shook me to my core a little. I'll be fine, really. It's not a common thing. I don't know. Yeah. That sword is a pickle. It's a mystery. Yeah. I feel funny. Caleb, you remember me asking you about your arcane prowess? My small experience with the arcane came to me around the same time that sword did. Not too long ago. Very recent. Right before I met up with Jester. Yeah, I was. Did a lot of merchant sailing, previously. Had one trip that didn't go so well. Suffice it to say, after it was done, I found that sword. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not real comfortable talking about it. I found it on the shore. When I got back to land, it was just there. I'm not super familiar with a ton of weaponry-- the sword I know, I had some training in it, but this seemed like a unique sword. I felt like it almost called to me. I know how that sounds, but when I picked it up, seemed like everything changed. Ever since, I've been able to do more things. Been able to reach out with some of the stuff I've seen you do. That's why I'm trying to make it up to the Academy. I'm trying to figure out what it is that I have. I don't mean to alarm any of you, really. I'm trying to be as forthright as I can. Can I make it appear? I focus. Reach down. You can see why I'm a little curious about this item. Do you have any experience with items like this? Could we revisit that idea, perhaps? I'm sorry, the night has left me a bit shaken, and I feel like I need a moment to get my bearings, if that's all right. Of course not, and I don't want to make anyone feel uneasy. Again, trying to be as transparent as I can. I don't quite understand, and I appreciate your patience in advance. And I make it vanish. (sighs) No. I hadn't considered that terrifying thought, but thanks. I'll just add that to the fucking list. In a jar? Tell you what, I start sweating real hard, I'll let you know, okay? I don't really remember. I don't really remember my dreams all that well. They leave me quickly. If you wouldn't mind. Horse? You're just too bad, Vasquez. Yeah. 16. Nein! Cookie monster. Oh shit. That's not really a-- Yeah, let's do that. Fire! I chase after the crownsguard. Yes. We are. A gnoll? Just go get them. It's all on the other side of a wall? You mean your water? 14. We do. We have to use the cover of the buildings. Diversions are absolutely-- Yeah, I was going to say, we're in it. This is a fight. So anything you want to do now, do it. Can I also, knowing that we're probably going to be up close, danger close, I'm going to cast Armor of Agathys on myself. You see a spectral frost start to harden around my armor in a shimmering light. Is that one of the were-thingies? Damn! (German accent) That was worse. 25 to 20. 16. Wow, guys. Wow. Oh, shit, already? Oh god. What are we calling these things? Oh! Throw that shit! In the foot. My legs are jumping around like crazy right now. Yeah, okay. With my 30 feet of movement, can I wrap around the far side of the house and just get to cover of the corner? Now there is an individual over there that sucks, right? I beg for forgiveness, I'm going to try some shit. I would like to cast-- Crown of Madness. (cheering) It is wisdom saving throw, I believe, let me double-check. Yeah, wisdom saving throw. So he becomes charmed, and a jagged crown of iron appears around his head, and madness glows in its eye. Yes, it is. Oh, melee. Fucking shit, I saw the bows. Damn the words in this book! But I can make him move towards something, right? Okay, good. I'm going to have him climb up on that roof and attack that other fucking gnoll that's up on that son of a bitch. That's fair. Can I use my bonus action to use my Mask of Many Faces to make myself look like a gnoll? No, they're taller. They're too tall. Two feet taller, I can only do a foot taller or shorter. I'd like to do it. I was hoping to just be-- Because I can't see that far-- to be right here to hit the only guy that could see me on the ground there. The guy on the roof can see me as well? That is it. I should have used it on that fucker. (raspy voice) Hey, come on, let's go. What dice are you rolling there, big guy? No, your d20, which one was it? That's all I heard! Melee, so if he has a weapon or anything, hit him. If not, just knock him the fuck off the roof. Spear! Oh, okay. Plus anything? That's a 20. That's a 19. Yeah, that's much better. Nine. Adding my modifier or its? 16 plus? Crown of Madness piece of shit. Can I go ahead and send, using my action to maintain it, can I send that stupid ass back up the roof? Knocked it out. No! Fuck it, I'll drop it and I'll come into the street, down the way 30 feet. But I look like a gnoll. But I still look like a gnoll. That will be my turn. I guess, because I dropped it, I have it. With my action, I'm going to cast Hexblade's Curse on that big son of a bitch. Yeah. It is. With my action, I will Eldritch Blast from where I am. Thank you. Skadoosh. It's a 15 plus six, 21. Amazing, 1d10. (counting) Sorry, I should've looked at this beforehand. 14. (yipping) That's it. Okay. Oh, that'll hit. Both hit. That's okay, I've got the armor. It deals damage when you hit me. LIAM and I got ten temporary hit points at second level, so he takes eight points of cold damage. So he'll take two points of cold damage and I'll take the other two points. Thank you, Sam. Oh, let's go this way! Here we go. Get up in that. Get a whole bunch of stank right in your face. Definitely hit. (chanting) Level three! Level three! CritRoleStats is going-- (clicking). Nice! (singing) Pour some sugar on him. Just going to take a quick timeout. But I'm a gnoll! Ah! I'm just confused, that hits. Understood. Yeah, great, awesome, sweet. Can I use Eldritch Blast against the big fucking guy, because he didn't get any closer for a melee attack, right? Oh. Imma fucking move out of his attack range. Does that give him attack of opportunity? Yeah, I'm doing that anyway. I'm going to move back towards the corner where I was going. No, all the way back. Back towards my original hiding place. That hits. I will now, out of his melee range, Eldritch Blast. Ugh, God, that's not great. 13. Nice. As I'm pulling around the corner, can I use my bonus action to drop the stupid, runty gnoll look? I need cover. We're at level three, that's got to be an acceptable option right now. Yeah, it's simple numbers. Them leaving is a good-- Hideous indeed. My turn. Can I hop around the corner again? I'll go ahead and use my 30 speed to close in on the proned-out. Great, and I'll use Eldritch Blast against that. 11. That's it. That's my turn. We need the assistance of guards, guys. It's hard. What, you really want to do something? Really? MARISHA and What's your spider sense? That'll be all the damage. Your friend took off running. I'll run forward using my 30 feet but I will call out Nott, get back here! Let them go! What were those creatures? Have you encountered them before? Such a grizzly scene, they seemed to be carrying away bodies on that cart they had. I did. Indeed. My concern is that they'll return. We've fended them off for now, but they'll come back. Are you going to run back to the group, or bring W.C. with? Oh, cool, okay. Indeed, we could provide some extra muscle, perhaps for some lodging while we stay and maybe we could aid your men and their efforts to exterminate this foe. Nein. Crute? We appreciate that. Hopefully, there won't be another call to action while they're here, but you can count on us if there is. Damn. I'm great with a bed. Jester!
