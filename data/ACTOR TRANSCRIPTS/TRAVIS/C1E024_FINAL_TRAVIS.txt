If you steal a horse, steal a horse and ride it. Bring your swag. Bring your friends. Because we were missing Sam. The unicorn appears. I heard that. It's subtle. It's up. Yeah, he's got it. Is that a ghostwriter on retainer that we can also use? (singing) I am the champion, my friends. What are you doing, Percy? You making more mousetraps? Guess not. I think we're all here. I'm moving through his stuff. Why not? But it moves! Should we guess? Was it public nudity? And these pricks are in good standing with the council? Do you want them dead? Or just skip ahead to the dead part? (laughing) Yeah, we do. You said you want them dead. Yeah. Oh! We do. I see a shiny tool. I don't know what it does. I take it (yawns) and put it in the Bag of Holding. There are lots of cool stuff in there! What was the check? Where's sleight of hand-- 17! It hurts. I put it back. It was a big thing of tongs. I didn't know what it did, I just wanted it. Are we supposed to go meet with the council right away? Besides, have we seen all the brothels in Emon? I don't think so. I go up to the kitchen and look for something to eat. Percy, is there anything in this shop that you want in the Bag of Holding for later? I'll give him mine. Do they crave blood? Ow. Quick question. Sorry, I kept something from falling in the shop-- really quick reflexes-- it's making my bits tingle. Do you have anything for that? No, I had that before. Not the same thing. I go over to the bucket of water and I stick my hands in the water. What do I do with a bag of powder? Yeah. Can I leave now? I go to the kitchen to eat. Yeah, I'm eating. Oh jeez! So perfect! So perfect for you. Walk away! Matt just visited his mind palace. (gasps) Did she blush? Why'd you miss? Well, we have a bunch of stuff. Yeah, what are you looking for? What are you looking for, Tiberius? Oh! Pieces of the enemy? We get paid for it. I've got two gold necklaces, two gold chalices, and two rubies. I don't have that shit. Everybody look at your stuff. I look inside my Belt of Dwarvenkind, and it says "Badass." I had it in the bag, yeah. I don't want to go! What if I want to stay? But I'm fucking floating above my meal! No! This is bullshit. And I'm bouncing off the ceiling and shit. Can I control myself? I just start trying to swim down to my plate. (eating noises) This isn't so bad. (farting noise) I'm in that kitchen, floating around, farting and eating food. Look, I've got priorities. Well, that makes sense. I'm asleep on the table. But only you 7,500. The rest can fuck off. Beard check, please! Three. Five. What? I don't know, I might have to get a cage; the women are going to come running. Good morning, Vox Machina. Lovely to see all of you. I know. Some guys are just lucky. (laughter) Hey, fuck off with your stinging, burning shit, all right? I'm not putting anything else in water. I don't know if you know, Scanlan, but water burns. No, I pretty much got it. In, burn, ouch, powder. I'm not a human. (gasps) You always drink water when we drink. Does it burn? I've got the creature bits so I should go, too. I jump in, too. Well, good. Let's get out of here. I put my arm around Vex and try and console her. Shall we go get our money now? I open the bag of holding and go, Here, here's one brain chunk. And I dump it on the floor. I thought I grabbed the brain chunk. I thought I grabbed an arm, too. There was just an arm from the stitched guy, and I just grabbed it. I start pretending to cry. And there were all these dark-- There were these wrinkled testicles that were walking around on feet. Strange thing. If you're stupid, and it looks at you with its wrinkled testicle face? You go unconscious. What about giving her advantage because I was talking about testicles? He's casting. I hold up the duergar's severed arm, and I curl all the fingers in and make a thumbs-up like that. Do you want the-- You're very gracious. Probably not. We should go. Tiberius, how do we get out of here quickly? But it's with your staff. We got so much money. Are we going to kill them? We've got a couple more days, too. He does? Jenga. Then we follow your lead. I'm at five total, right? 46. 45. 55. A one. And a 95. I assume dodge. I just became the most handsome man in the world. 13. Appetizer of things to come, my friend. Half a beard? Like, just one side of my face? I say in a low, guttural growl-- Vax. I didn't have to wake up to know it was you, motherfucker. I reach down, I find a dark stone on the ground, and I go over to the bare side of my face and I draw a very beautiful mustache to complete the other half of it. Because you're the only fucking idiot stupid enough to do that! Maybe I don't know. Let's say I assume. (laughter) Eight, four. That's great. That's your call. We have three fancy robes. Are there any tapestries or curtains in the castle? I walk up to the prettiest one and I rip it down, and I throw it over myself like a toga. And I practice my curtsy. Because I've seen Vex and Keyleth do it, so I think everybody does it. What's wrong with this? I'm from a strange land. My customs are my own. No. It burns. ORION I do Prestidigitation immediately to get rid of some kind of smell that I'm sure is emanating. It must have been that powder you gave me before. It made me immune. I wipe it away! I reach into the bag of holding and I take out a little goblet, and I pour some ale in it. And I walk over to Vax, and I go, here you go. You're welcome. Would you like some more? Probably smart. I'll take that back. I crush the goblet in my hand. Oh no! What happened? I hand the Potion of Climbing to Vax and say, don't die. Call him Vaxy. Are you ready for this, Vaxy? Is that carriage. Is the carriage still there? And the armed on horseback that were with the Briarwoods when they came in? The four are with them? Real Vax or Vaxy? The king. You can move that over here actually, thank you. (chomping noises) Just right out with it. Lucky for you. I look at Vax and I go, does anyone want any dessert? Yeah. Vaxy. The one that I can look at. (muffled) Go see if he's still there. Hashtag Save Vax!
