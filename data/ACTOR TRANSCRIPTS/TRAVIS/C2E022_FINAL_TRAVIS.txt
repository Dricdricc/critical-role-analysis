It could also be like a fro-yo factory, I mean, that's not-- There's a lot of work going into this. You can tell. I mean, there are Xeroxed copies. Oh man, that's a good one. Winner. That's a blue-ribbon echelon. We got to rest up, right? I think Caleb has a little booby trap for that, don't you? Add some distance, yeah. LAURA and I only saw, like, five. No, but I got pretty fucking sharp eyes, all right? They call me Eagle-Eye Fjord where I come from. (cawing) Crow Fjord, or maybe raven, you don't know. It is. I don't know if we leave the tree. Yeah. And we know where the entrance is. Also very popular. That's right, Kiri, Bird-Eye Fjord. It's sticking. No. We make our way up the rope into the bottom of the tree, but the entrance is still open. I'll take first watch, if you want. I can post up outside and do a little illusion work. Oh my god, I can't believe you said it. Go fuck yourself. Yeah? About what time is it, anyway? Light still coming in from the outside of the tree? All right. Yep. Shoot. You're not good at apologizing? Yeah, I'm fucking with you. You reckon you need to apologize? You know, a great place to start with apologies is to mention the stuff you just said. No, after that, right. One. Dos. Yeah, that's a really good apology. Yeah. However, right? Be genuine. Don't be embarrassed to apologize. It takes a big person to apologize for something. Little people are the ones that make mistakes and just let them go. No, like small on the inside. That's big of you. Yeah, I think he deserves that. He's been good to us. All right. I think it will. You can actually leave the smile out of it this time, just to be clear. No, that's going to set the tone in a real weird way. There's a thing called sarcasm that you ride a line with sometimes. No. Beau and I are up first. Yep. Five. With an arrow in our throat? I didn’t see-- (choking) What, what? Hit the wall against the hole, right? We'll take either side of it, either flank. No, because we still want to go down there. Molly, I want you to get right on the edge of the hole and keep an eye down the shaft. Let it come all the way up if it does. Grapple it, fall flat, kill it quietly. It came up the tunnel that was already there? I did Eldritch Blast and a 20 and a 24. Ten and a nine. 19 points of Eldritch Blast. Monstrous or--? I will. Yeah, same. Yeah, you and Yasha go. Nein! But he's got to stay awake for it. Oh my god. (quietly) Yes! So boyish. Nice work, Yasha. Indeed. Take the rope, we start lowering it down there. Yep. I think right before we go under the water we should. Oh yeah, this is an amphibious assault. Like five. Amphibious. Yeah, there's a sea “anenome” under there as well. Why aren't you good in water? You can hold your breath, right? Listen, when we get down there, I'm going to swim a rope under the water to where we're going. It's going to be like a guide line, so whoever you ride with can pull on the rope and you’ll just hang on. Fuck you, Kiri. No, she can't. We could leave her in here with you if you want, but if you see trouble you're going to have to get in that water and come across. Yep. Yep. One or the other. All right, I'll take the other 50-foot section of rope and I'll start wading into the water, and I'll take a swim back the way I went. (high-pitched sound) It's like Aqua Velva. What do you mean? Don't worry about me. I'm just swimming over there and coming back. And then we can cast it. It's a guideline. 12. Apocalypse Now. 60 feet. Where is that? Class features-- Racial traits. Darkvision. 60 feet. Do they have an eyeline on me if they were to look over this way? Could they see my head above the water? Can I wade forward and look for any stones or pillars that I might be able to throw the rope around and tie a knot on? That's a two. Yep! That's amazing. I'm in the water, man. Okay, great. I'll give it a gentle tug. Does it seem like the structure moves at all? I'll take a deep breath and I'll use it to pull myself chest up towards the surface. Yeah. Still five of them. I tied it off. Everybody should be able to pull their way across no problem. But we got to be ready to rock when we get in there. They're a little distracted. Yeah. Or distract away from us and then go. Or if we want we could cause a commotion and have them come through the water at us and use the hole as a funnel. Thoughts? I'm a very fast swimmer. I think it's 60 feet, actually, is my swimming speed with this damn Mariner’s armor. Ignore what I said. Regular speed, yeah. (laughter) Well then yeah, it’s 30 feet. Well with it, it’s my normal walking speed. Nah, could I guesstimate how far it was from entrance to portal? Where the rope is? 13. I'm back. So you want to head over there? Okay. I see the validity in that argument. Pass Without a Trace first? Okay! I don't know. About 45, 50 seconds. How many books you got there? Shall we, Pass Without a Trace? Shit balls ass! Let's do it. Kiri's got to die. Thousands of artists are like (gasping). Yeah, I'll go first. Distract and attack. If they don't see us. As I go in the water, I'm going to go about halfway and then stop and tread and make sure that everybody gets along the rope fine. Thank god for that Pass Without a Trace. 19. Oh shit, we got smoke! That's the one that was distracted. They rolled really high. Yo, what's up? 20 to 15? Oh fuck. Oh shit. What? Oh my god, you guys. Jester. Caleb, Molly. I'm a big fat three. We got the surprise round, so it's fine. This is the surprise round. Okay, good. It's acid. Man, that thing does not make up its mind. Yep. I'll make my way towards the two on the left side, as far as my-- Yeah. Oh damn, that's as far as I can get, huh? Yeah, melee range. Nice. I will use Booming Blade in a melee strike with the Wastehunter falchion against that fishy fuck. 14. It does? Oh my god, thank you. 1d8, because I didn't say two-handed. That's 12 points of damage, plus because it's a monstrosity? 12 points of damage plus four. That is a four. 18 points of damage. With Booming Blade-- Yes sir. With my bonus action, I will Hex this guy over here. Yes sir. Yes, it does. I'll give him disadvantage on wisdom. Yeah! LIAM and It's after Yasha, right? Are these free tridents, or do they also have that cord that's attached to them? That hits; it's my armor class. Okay. Seven points of damage. That hits. That hits. That's a 17. Nein! I didn't-- I need to make Hex checks. Oh shit, how many of them? Three? At advantage because War Caster, right? Okay. What is that, constitution? Okay. That's a 15. Did 15 work? Nice. Higher than a ten, sorry. That's a natural 19, that'll do it. And 13-- that's an 18. All three save. Oh shit, you guys! Oh, fuck. I am sorry. I did not understand that part. The lesson in the lesson. Well, fuck me sideways. We get like, little strobes from the lightning. It's like that opening sequence in Blade. After getting so fucked up that last round-- the scratch, the bite, and the trident in the gut-- I'll put both hands on the falchion and say, Do not see me, and I'll cast Blink. It is not. That's my turn. Whoosh. Worcestershire sauce. I forgot to do the 2d8 of booming damage on the gentleman behind Molly. So that's a big one, and three, so four points of booming damage. Oh was it? Ah. They do-si-doed? Fair enough. Can I appear right next to this gentleman on his reverse? There you go. I will break my-- That sounds dandy. Great. I will break my Hex, and I will use a Hexblade's Curse as my bonus action on that gentleman. I will make two attacks with the Wastehunter falchion against him with the monstrous-- Flanking gets-- what does it add? Does it do anything? Okay, so first attack. 15. Great. And the second one. Neither of those are a crit, but that's a 24 on the second one. (counting) 17. For the Hexblade, four points of damage, so 21 on the first one. (counting) 17 on the second. I'll shift in right behind him and see Molly looking around, give him a little wink, and I'll take the falchion and take the back of his head off. Sorry. I was getting what for, man. Shit. And I'll-- oh wait. Natural 20. Peace out! I heal 13 points. That's that barbarian shit! All day. I'm up for that all day. That's what I'm here for. Let him know! She healed up drunk. Yes. Hate-fish. They have great sushi there. So what is it? What is it? At advantage, too? Come on, now! Like the gas range, he's trying to-- Just then, a couple bubbles. Closer to Molly. And I go, boo! Ah, shit. Fuck. And seeing that they're engaged elsewhere, I'll fire my first two Eldritch Blasts at the one that's engaged with Molly and Yasha. Which is 18 to hit. Hexblade's Curse. That is 12 points of damage. Is he still up? Then I'll send the second one in his direction as well. That's 22 to hit. Seven points of damage. I'll pop up and be like, fuck, the first time I do it, son of a bitch. And I'll go (magical buzzing and whooshing) and send both of them over there. As Molly looks over, I'm like (blows). 13. It's important to remember that you don't-- (laughter) I got you. I got it right here. If you got that right, that's some fucking Beautiful Mind shit. You know what, it's okay, because there's fucking smoke on our map. Come on, 13 or less. I believe you. Yep, you're at one. (singing) You got the perfect warlock. (laughter) (chanting) Apology, apology! "Did I say I was sorry?" Look real mean. I'll reappear and take-- Ten feet closer to Yasha's direction, on land still. I will hold Eldritch Blast until I see the reappearance of-- To hit for it? Oh. Aww, shitballs. 16. Ah ha-- (yelps) Show your fucking fa-- (yelps) No. I can see and hear and all that stuff. Guys? (distressed yelp) Fuck you, Molly! Yeah! (meowing) Oh yeah, just Caleb. She's still up. Turn this man into fish sticks. I know. I only see that at home. Yeah, just real quick. I'll reappear ten feet closer to Jester. Yep. And I'll unleash two Eldritch Blasts. That's not going to hit. That's a ten. And that's a 14 on the dot. Oh, it does, that's right. Oh, roll to see-- I disappear. (bamfing noise) You guys are doing good-- (bamfing noise). Come on, Yasha. Nein! It's shallow priest discretion. What will he do? Look as the DM muddles his choices. Considers consequences. Plans his retribution. As his hair dangles beautifully in front of his face. Thinks-- (singing) I'm in another dimension! So if you hit with your Sentinel does that mean its speed is reduced to zero? Wouldn't want to be ya! Can I Blink back in and go, stop! (panting) Can I make my way over and up the steps? Good shit, man. Good shit. Think of the baby! Stay calm. Seven points of healing? Roll low. Can I pick up his big trident that has the cord attached to it? Is it wrapped around his wrist, or anything? Is that how he was pulling people? Is it attached to his person in some way? I'll take the trident and unhook it from his armor. These guys were big. Yeah, y'all look for shit. I'm going to meditate for a hot second. Where did you leave her? Are there any stairways, or doors, or gates, or anything that would lead upwards from this cavern? Yeah, I'll take a closer look. 14. Natural 19, for 21. You guys, come up here. There's a ton of arms up here. There's battleaxes and swords, but there's all these trinkets and holy symbols. Careful? Yeah, I actually wouldn't mind if you check for magic. And Nott, actually, there's this four-foot long box if you want to try and open her up for me. I think so. It looks to be latched shut in some way. The four-foot long one. The iron one and the wooden one. Yeah, sure. We're kind of in the middle of a short rest anyways. He's still doing his magic circle or whatever. Is this on the priest? The shallow priest? Who are you talking to, Jester? Do you feel the Traveler in here? It's actually a little discomforting, these symbols. There's also some very dark deities here. Asmodeus. Asmodeus? Asmodeus, Bane the Strife Emperor, Tiamat-- LAURA and Can you describe what the Bane, the Strife Emperor, symbol looks like? Here? It's just this little handheld thing? Can I toss it into the well? Did any of the shortswords, longswords, battleaxes-- any of those register under Caleb's magic sweep or they're just nicely made? Oh, put that shit in the pile. I'm not going to interrupt, but that sphere looks very-- Yeah, famili-- Do you mind if I-- is it wet? If it fits the gash in the side of the sphere. While he's concentrating on it, can I sit down next to him and touch it? Yeah. How do I feel? I feel funny. What happened? Into me? I felt like I'd seen it before. I just wanted to touch it. I don't know. You ever see something you felt like you'd seen in a dream before, but you don't know why or how? I'm sorry. I felt compelled to-- I felt like there was half a chance I'd touch it and it wouldn't be there. I saw things. People I knew. A man, he's very dear to me. I don't understand it, but he was-- I was him, and he was holding the sphere. The eye. Again, you ever have that dream where you look in the water and you see another face looking back at you, like you're someone else? SAM and 50/50. You said I put the sphere in my-- I saw him do-- I saw me as him doing the same thing. He was standing over someone, covered in blood, and he put the sphere inside of him. He was my mentor, a captain of mine. A man named Vandrin. Yes. I haven't seen him in quite some time. I don't know what any of this means, but I'm not a fan of losing track of time like that. I bend over and put my hands on my knees, and-- I don't feel anything. I do feel pretty tired, though. I'm not exactly sure. He may be dead. He captained a ship that I worked on for many years and there was an incident. I believe so. There was an explosion, and we were in terrible weather. There were waves, we were being thrown about, and I was knocked overboard. I never saw what happened to Vandrin, but when I woke up, I was back on shore and I didn't see anything of the ship or him or any of the other crewmates. I would like that. I would like that very much; he was very good to me when a lot of people in my life haven't been, but he was holding the sphere-- how could he be holding it if I was? (demonic voice) I'll tell you how I survived! Did I recognize the body that was lying in blood? No, no details. I knew this man very well. He was almost like a father to me, and I never saw him holding anything like this. Not that I remember. Do I ever remember seeing anything like that in his quarters, in his offices, anything? It's unique, I'd remember. I'm not leaving anything out. I'm not entirely sure. I remember getting thrown overboard, the waves overtaking me. It was a hell of a fight, and I'm a real good swimmer, but you’d come up for air one second and your mouth would be full of salt water the next. I remember losing track of which way was up. It's funny, when you're underwater and it's dark, the only way to tell which way is towards the surface is by blowing bubbles. I did that as hard as I could with all the air that was in my lungs and those bubbles disappeared. I remember it stinging, filling my chest and the next thing I knew, I was face-down on the shore. Yeah. I've heard a lot of tales of men drowning, being brought back. They say that same thing. But no one was with me on that shore, I was alone. Just a merchant ship. He had many. There was a bit of sabotage on the ship. I wish I knew. If I'm lucky, one of these days I'll find out. The pool water? But good and evil deities. On the edge or around it, right? Not in? 16. For what? LAURA and But you can't see it! I don't have it! LAURA and How big is the well? Oh shit, that's not a bad call. I'll check my reflection in the well. (coughs once) Try again. (inhales) I'm tapping like a motherfucker. (coughing) Anybody want any of the weapons? Shortswords, longswords, battleaxes? Who's holding onto the broken-off hilt? Do you mind if I carry that? No, I'm not. We have four sticks. I just said we have two sticks. Okay, all right. Climbing the rope back up top, to the base of the tree. "Why would they do that?!" (whispers) Genuine. Not too tight. Nice job. (coughing) Quit while you're ahead. Drunk-ass fucking Nott, dwelling on old shit. He bleeds death and stuff. We'd have to hit him from afar. It might not be worth it.
