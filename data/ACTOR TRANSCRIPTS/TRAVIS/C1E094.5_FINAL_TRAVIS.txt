See, our store go hard. We should look into Critical Role cannabis. We're getting fired. Cash me outside. (laughter) It's fine. You're a baby. What, high school awkward pose? Air punch it. I have a question about those, are they edible like the ones in Fraggle Rock? I have wanted to eat those my entire life. Number one on the call sheet. The first one! You're that kid from Les Mis! (laughter) Yeah! (laughter) Oh. (higher) Yeah. Who are you? Why are my hands so small? Why do I look like Vern from Stand By Me? Where is this gross polo coming from? And my tiny 80s shorts? Why are my socks all the way up to the bottom of my knees? (laughter) Why do these shoes have velcro straps on them? Why are you calling her Ashley? TALIESIN and What were you watching? (voice breaking) Should all of our voices, like, be-- Are there any pockets that aren't covered in-- Can I search the kid's pockets? Is there anything in the pocket? Just a little-- nope! Not a thing! Nothing. (cries) I haven't seen an R-rated movie at this point. (cries) (laughter) I know, I ran out of Jurassic Park in the theater! Yeah I seriously am. (cries) I don't feel adult. Yeah, they were on that awesome motorcycle. 11. Me, 11. I'm, like, 11? Right? I am turning and booking ass away from it, with my spindly little legs, as fast as I can. Yeah, I'm just running from the naked cat. It's total Goonies run, too, it's like-- TRAVIS and We haven't even opened anything. We're just still, like, (yells). Is he doing it in a frenetic way or is he just methodically-- (panting) There's a guy! You've got beautiful blond hair, you should go. Oh no! Wait, don't go! I know. What was he hitting? While he's walking up, can I look? Can I scan? It's you and me. (whispers) It's you and me! What are you doing? No! What does the hair look like? You're going in there? Okay! Can I try to help him? Yeah. Does he have any facial hair? Marisha's a badass bitch! Just not sure of anything! My mom gave me this shirt. Can I see your glasses? Naked and hairless. Everything's dangerous! (laughter) Because we lived in different states. I was melting action figures. Is there a sun? No, we saw you, you were there! You rode in-- We saw you, you rode in on this sweet Harley and you looked like you were from the Mad Max time period and you were all badass. Not like you look right now. You don't have a motorcycle parked behind the-- Huh, okay. No? Nope! I'm fucking out again, just booking ass. Running like the wind, like Forrest Gump coming out of them leg braces! I'm out. 22. Four. Disadvantage. Nah, I'll go back. I was convinced. No. I'm going to use my action to reach in and grab what is definitely all-white tighty-whiteys, and I'm going to rip the elastic band off of my briefs-- I'm going to pull the elastic band off and prepare to, I don't know. (laughs) Yes, to strangle. It's a 12. I'll use my dash to try and join the other crew. Look at that. (heavy breathing) My asthma is a problem at this point. My Ventolin inhaler is broken. I think they did that because something bigger's coming. We saw an old guy. Yeah, we saw an old man, he was trying to peel you out of the tomato plant you were in. I have no idea. Did you really? Because you love this. Yeah. Should I say it? I have a theory about where we are. I feel like we're in the Upside-Down. Both. Are there any working flashlights in the security booth? 13. He was super old. He was old and weak. He had a glint of glasses. Let's try to go after the old guy. It's true. I'm booking ass. I ran everywhere! I was fast as shit! My ADHD was in overdrive all the time. Yeah, but I'm fast again, y'all! Yeah, let's go run into the funnel. It's Inception. Nope. Nair. Nine. And in fact, around Matt, the water is quite warm. Go. Have no fear! But there are fish in the ocean, Taliesin! Oh no. A strength check. That's a nine. Oh god. A little rabbit pellet makes it through the shorts. Straight through. Oh my god! With fogged-up glasses. You're a track mark! Oh my god! Watch out, there's poop down there! Kill me. Kill me! I'm fucking dying up here, man! Yeah! Yep. Oh sure, I just want to fucking run like a rabbit, man. I'm going to go with it. Yeah. You hear a really girly scream from inside the one mouth. Yeah! (laughter) Triple dash! No, we're doing good. This is where we turn the tide. She starts with "listen." (laughs) (laughs) You've played too much DND. And then there was two. Did Ashley wear the upper torso of Marisha in your dream? Especially because we French kiss all the time. Everybody's dead, so... Hey, wait, wait, before you go, Liam. What do we look like to you? I don't wanna speak for Laura, but she doesn't really like to rehearse beforehand, she just-- "Well, that's gonna fucking depend on you, isn't it?" Yeah. Bill? Beemer? Hey, Bill, what time is it, man? How long have we been here? 930, okay, yeah. Right, okay. He's ripped! (laughs) It's actually-- you fucking made it. It's Sony. Outside, unfortunately. Natural one. That was adult-Liam, too. Take a bite out of Sam. Get him out of the volume! Well, where am I? Right there. I'm gonna take off the certainly at this point very hot battery pack that is attached to my stomach, peel it off the velcro, and I'm gonna run at the giant arachnid demon thing and I'm gonna bash one of its legs with the hot battery. 14. Yeah. Cool. Nice. Can I look up at it, see if it flashes anything at me? 12. That's a lot for me. Five, that's a lot. Masking tape and 'Ashley' written on it. Can I reach up to my mocap helmet and wrench the little GoPro camera that's surrounded by LED lights. Can I wrench it off and can I face it towards it, go, backfeed! Yeah, you know, like little fucking Hobbits, like you know, little Bilbo did, using the-- Yes! Okay. Ooh! 27. Oh, sorry, sorry. 21. Oh, I won't spend it now. 21. 19 plus two. It's Colla. Colla's in the machine. Oh, no. Are we bolting for Crafty? (laughter) They got ginger beer and all sorts of shit. I am going to head for the door. The green one, down at the-- yeah. That thing. As far as I can go. Yeah. (sings) He whipped his hair back and forth, he whipped his hair back and forth. It's like Phantom of the Opera. I'm going to Crafty. Nature Valley granola bars. Grab the last one of them fruit snacks. I'm double-dashing for Crafty. Nope. This is all a bad dream. I'm going. It's green! This is going terrible. There's a kale smoothie. There's egg rolls out here! I'm in the cubes. Join me in Crafty. Well, let's be descriptive, shall we? Of course you can do all of that. Go offline. (whispering) He's at Crafty. Yeah? Just to be clear, no tables or cans of Sterno? I'm bolting up that tunnel. Saving the day. (sings) Saving the day! Come on! Wow. We can't hit shit! We can't do anything. Should have backed up! I jizzed in my pants. (giggling) Yeah. Isn't it-- The big watery eyes. It's going to catch him? Oh no. Knowing that I have an intelligence of 12, which is double what I usually work with, and that color is green, which is what geniuses choose, I continue down the tunnel. What if? (sings) Making my way downtown-- Oh. Yeah, come this way! Come up this way! I'll wait. Oh my god. I'm checking for traps. Yeah. Nope. What do I do? That's an eight. It's clear! I'm running. Yeah, you're running. Guys, you all have cameras on the front of your helmets. Why are you shining lights into your own fucking faces? Turn them around. Yep. You mean the tentacles that have been shooting out of your fucking fingers? Is it carbon fiber? Get your head out of your ass, come on. Why don't we try to break the glass? We've been going a long time. We'll continue on for a bit more. Okay. These shoes are uncomfortable. They smell like other people's feet! Yes. I could wring out this mocap suit. (laugh) (laughter) Oh no. Yep. Taliesin, kill this motherfucker. Taliesin, just kill him. Somebody show me another-- I put my hand on the glass and I say, give it a shot. (laughter) I couldn't breathe. I could not breathe. I was in trouble.
