Look at him flittering around! You're shaking it! Oh my god. How you ever snagged it with just a kitchen garbage bag is beyond me. No, we asked, you just don't pay attention to email. (laughter) Clearly, we're going to talk to El Jefe. (laughter) Yeah, it's not like he wouldn't know where we went if we left, anyway. A little more mid, a little less treble. We can head over. It's like a step in the way out. Then we'll have to make it worth our while. Yeah, we'll make a decision. Beau is in her element. How have you been, Kutha? Yeah, me too, all right. The first guy's name was Louis? From the research facility? Should we stop this? (Laughing) Okay. You just got this! Third level is like 5d10. With this flash of action, I mask my voice and go I've got five gold on the horny one! She's cracking it out! I walk over to the other side of the crowd and go I got ten gold on the one with the bandages! Trying to whip up a betting frenzy. On who? Talking super fast. All coked up. Nah, we're walking out of this city, miles. That's us. Always down for a scrap. Of course. It didn't seem like our options above ground were all that plentiful. We were more than anxious to hear what you might offer. Oh. Indeed. I assume it doesn't mean overthrowing it. More manipulating it to your individual gain. Yes. A tantalizing offer. You said you had others? Could you describe your friend, Vabron? MARISHA, LIAM, and No grill, busted eye. Okay. Would we have the same sort of timetable for this mission, a month? Anything else? Well, perhaps we'll partake of some beverages and discuss. Anime sparkles. Your one busted eye is wandering. We'll learn him, it's all right. Give us some time to discuss, and we'll get back to you shortly. Is there an open booth or-- Yeah, the darkest corner. Well, what do you think? Shadycreek Run. You have no preference? Any preference to water versus, perhaps, an abundance of dry ground? Plus, if this is as aggressive as they say it is, an attack on the border, I'm sure that legionnaire's job will be there when we return anyway. Price might have increased. Better to bet on the underbelly rising up than the top maintaining what it has. Remind me what's in Hupperdook? Hupperdook? Okay, definitely stopping in Hupperdook. So we're going to take that shady underground river out. Turned on? Are you crushing on him? How many of us are uncomfortable hearing that word? Yeah, it's gone dark, right? So either remove whatever's in there and get it back up and running again. That's a pretty good printer. Why? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we've held up our part of the bargain. Yeah, if he's there. I just don't want to go out of our way looking for him and all of a sudden have the guilt of, you know. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like our efforts here in the city. I think we've done good. Hard to keep track of parties outside of our purview. Yeah. Just over it, huh? Plus, it'll give us time to leave? Maybe things will change by the time we come back? Or maybe not. We'll see. Never know what happens outside. Oh, really? You're more nomadic? Okay. Let's do it, yeah. We'll pound our drinks; keep them away from Beau because she'll drink all of them. All right. We'll leave Molly and Jester here to nurse their drinks and their short rests and we'll go back up and speak to the Gentleman. No? Yeah. Anybody that's not nursing a short rest. Is Sorad the female goliath? Sorah. Is she present in the tavern at the moment? Nice. I will approach. Indeed. We have good news. We have decided to take you up on your offer. The Lebenda Swamp. The Lebenda Swamp is what we've decided to take you up on. Oh. I thought we were doing the beginner's course? Oh, we're doing both? Apparently our ambition has no limit. Both it is. (laughter) By water or also on foot? Do we still have the cart, and the two horses? We're unfortunately a little short on transportation. We could use a few horses. Outstanding. Jester did have an excellent question. We'll need certain remedies, especially near the water. Anything that you can provide that might put us in an advantageous position would be most appreciated. Do you know what is also as valuable as resources, is knowledge. In this swamp area, are there any particular hazards that we should keep an eye out for that your men have seen repetitively? I wouldn't presume to be as lucky as to have Louis have tried this mission before and fucked it up as well, has he? Hey, Louis! Fuck you! Yep, he's a winner. Swamp pun? Fucking shit. This is very exciting, two missions at once. Well, it's still a really good time in the day we should go ahead and make preparations. Make our way back up? As we pass that big ogre on the way out I say Kutha, keep it real, all right? That's a big hand. Fucking Kutha can't catch a break. I mean, we can head over to the cart and horses. More? Okay, there's nothing there. But you can finally kill him if you want to. (laughter) As you run off I say Meet us at the cart and horses. I do. Who's riding on the cart first? Yeah, we got like five horses and a cart. Two horses pulling the cart? Or two and three solos? How many horses do we have? Okay. Two horses pulling the cart, and four solos? Who else wants to be on the cart? Okay. What? That's right, sorry. I'll take a horse as well. Keep that demon cat away from me. El gato es el diablo, all right? The Feywild? Is it like another city? One thing at a time. What's it sound like? Only rats that they ate. Pure death. Fucking anaphylactic shock. I guess I'll take the lead and we'll make our way out the city. Heading northeast, right? To the Bronchial Byway. I think we'll go at a regular pace until we get to the Bromkiln Byway. At the Amber Road, we should be all right. Are there any tree clusters or rock clusters or boulders or anything that provides shelter? I'm the wrong person to be doing this. I'll aid you. Just off the road is fine. At this point, I'd like to see the road as well. That way we can see anyone coming. I have a torch as well. I'll throw in two, Molly. I'll take first watch. My perception's shit. How's yours? I'll aid you, how about that? Yep. That was such church youth trip flirting! Because it's night. Like when you get a sunburn and you wake up, and they're fucking sticking to you and stuff? It sucks. You've got to rip them off, just one big one. Is she telling the truth? Do I feel like she's telling the truth? Shit. You and your brothers and sisters? Or you and your children or parents? Oh. But you're not super tight with them. No favorite brother or sister or playmate or-- Do you fight any urges when you see a small child walking through the city, to go up and, I don't know, I don't mean any disrespect, but to snatch it? Yeah, no, I'm being honest. Because if I know there's a little kid running around, and if you're fucking tracing the damn thing, I want to know that I can put a hand out. Just checking. I haven't met many that do, so pardon my, you know-- In your belly? All Fjord sees is a little kid's hand, like chewing on a little kid's hand So there's fire. So what? Did you want to see if somebody worth bargaining with or something? Sure. Send the cat. Is the shed from where we are now, still like a mile away? I want to check out the shack. Yeah. Keep your cat. I'm going too. Yeah. Scanning the land and the trees around, doing a quick once-over of the close area. Six. Looks clear. I'll head around back. I'll make my way another quarter way around the house so I can see Yasha and Molly, and I'll say Go ahead, I'll keep an eye out. I can see both. I can hear it, but I can't see it. I'll start making my way over to their horses, having heard them go inside. I think. Who was that? What was in there? Oh. Nice. Fair enough. Was it just the one guy in there? What did he have? Just meat and-- Nah. Shall we? Good call. I'll look this time. Ten. Ten. There's a cluster of trees up ahead. We could aim for that. Let's do it. We can break off some branches and some kindling. Poison arrow. Bring it out! 17. Caleb, Fjord, Molly. Through both campaigns. Wow. Oh fuck. Misses. What'd you cast on the big guy? I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Hexblade's Curse on the big ol' fellow that Caleb pointed at. I use my 30 feet of speed to run this way, southeast. Between these two trees, if I can. Towards this direction. Can I get within melee of this guy? Oh really? Five, ten, 15, 20. No. I'm going to come this way, over here, if I can. Great. I will use Eldritch Blast against those two goblins hiding behind the tree. I haven't pulled it yet. I now have two bursts of Eldritch Blast. That's a 12 for the first one? Natural 20. That's four plus four is eight, plus four is 12. 12 points of damage. Nice. That completes my turn. Ooh, the in-suck is the worst! Oh, fuck. He's like this. Mom coming into the room. No meta in this family, y'all. No meta in this family. Not in this house! We won't have it! (similarly) For fuck's sake! (high pitched) He's alive! Give me that pigeon any day, man. (coos) He's alive! What is that? What the shit? (electric guitar riff) On all of our points. We might need a mini for that, because that sounds awesome. Holy shit. There's two wolves, right? You son of a bitch! So celebratory. Yeah, you're next. That hits. Does not hit. MATT One arrow, the other manages to catch you in the side of the neck and stick in, before it falls out of the wound. Not deep enough to stick you too hard, but you do suffer eight points of piercing damage. That's max damage, and I need you to make a constitution saving throw. What does a 20-foot sphere look like on the map? Four squares? Yeah, 20-foot sphere. Jesus. It just says 20-foot sphere. Area's 20 feet, so it should be-- I'll use my 30 feet to run towards this goblin. Great, and I will use Booming Blade to make a melee attack against him. That is 18 plus seven, 23. It's a d8 plus the thunder damage. This is the first time I've used it, I'm real excited. (counting) Eight, so 18 points. With Booming Blade, is that just one of my two attacks per action? Lesson learned, and I'll use the rest of my action to get up on the back. Yeah, I'm sorry, the rest of my movement. So that's 20, 25, 30. What is that called? I do. Amazing. That is 26 to hit. Is this considered a monstrosity or a beast? Gotcha. 13 points of damage. You're just teeth-to-teeth! (growl) Oh, shit. That regains nine hit points for me because of Hexblade's Curse. Thank you! She just snaps to you. Yasha came to game, dawg! You almost shattered that screen! Is that you next to him? Amazing. I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Hex on that tall-- Yeah. On that waterfall of ugliness. Oh. I'll drop the sword. I will send two bursts of Eldritch Blast in its direction. That's a 13. And a 16. That's eight and six and 1d6. 12. Oh. 13. Yeah. I'll see them whaling on that big fucker and I release the falchion and send two across the way at him. Indeed. Drop it. Yasha? You feeling okay? You had-- You had wings. Can you fly? Only when you're really angry? Yeah, it's really-- She's gesturing an awful lot, I don't know. Just us! What language is that? Caleb, you're very-- Oh, from-- What about the big old weapons that the two bruisers were-- are they massive? Five vials of toxin. Well, not that that wasn't terribly exciting. Still crazy dark out? Thanks for catching that, you two. If that had snuck up on us, we would have been super fucked. Yeah, we would have been paste. Caleb, Nott, thank you. You seem real excited to hurt your own kind. Yeah, I think we all will. Knowing all that, you showed a lot of bravery tonight. Gradual steps. Working our way through syntax. Well, no. There could be enlightened tribes out there, committed to changing their ways. That's fine. You're with us. I'm all right in the rain. I'll take the first-- oh wait. No, y'all got it. I'm just up anyway. You can sleep in the rain or under the cart. You just don't pay attention.
