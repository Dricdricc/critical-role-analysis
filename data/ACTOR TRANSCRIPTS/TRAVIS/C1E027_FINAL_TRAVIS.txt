They are pretty sexy. You're welcome. Quarry. Because we are many. Nipples, is it really? Kit Buss, why are you the best? I guess three ladies. Congratulations, Laura. What is with that dice and you, man? It misses? Nobody does. Okay. Come on, you giant ball-bearing. Damn. 16. 17. Fan the hammer, motherfuck. 50. I go into a rage, and I come in, and I turn to the right, and I run up as close as I can to Jared-- Yeah, Jarett. And wispy fuck. I take out a holy oil vial out of the Bag of Holding, I crush it in my hand, and I take a swing at whatever he's holding. That's a one. Not off to a good start with this. Number two. Disadvantage. Fuck. 15. One of these guys? One. Plus rage, which is-- Oh, right. Eight. Well, hell, it was worth a shot. Oh, at disadvantage. 19. Eight again. Would you say the blood from my hand is splattering Jarett behind him? I'm a painter. Oh shit. We're all going to go deaf. There you are. Hold still, Casper! And I run up and I swing. (laughter) That's 28. That's a 27. 17. Ten, so 14 on the first one, plus fire damage. 17 plus-- 21. No. Is that right? Did I do that right? Yeah. So 21. The second one. And 17, 21 again! You've been drinking? You casting that all over the place now aren't you, fancy-pants? I remember I have the holy oil in my hand, mixed with the blood, and I start blessing him. With bloody fist. Yeah, what was that thing? Fuck if we know. I volunteer to sleep down in the room. It's better down here, isn't it? Yeah, totally away from him. Fucking hell. I start to take the fucking bed up the stairs. We go to sleep? Since he's sleeping in the room with me, I take a few of the caltrops that I have and I put them on the inside of the doorway before I close it. I love you. (eating noises) Can I make a beard check? 66. Just a little tingle? Eight. We are not cool right now. Hakuna matata? Why don't we let Seeker Asum finish? You know, if we kill the Briarwoods, is this even a point? Seeker Asum, we have managed to capture and keep one of the coachmen. Down in our cell. Would he be safer in our hands, or within the castle walls? I'm fucking asking. Never mind. Yeah, we lie. Why are you going to Wildemount, again? What do we need him here for? Let's do that. Yeah, do you want us to come with you or what? If you die, can you write a letter and sign your name saying that we were right, you were wrong, you were full of shit, the Briarwoods are assholes-- Or not. All right. Can we just vote on something, please? Since Percy's being oh-so-quiet about all this. Are you sure you have nothing to say? All in favor, say aye. ALL (except Orion) Aye. That temple of Sarenrae is in the city. I want to go to the store. I would like to get a shovel and a pickaxe. I don't give a fuck where we go. Just a shovel and a pickaxe. I thought you said you were going to be brief. (laughs) (old-man voice) I'm fine. It's my knee. (laughter) I think they can bite besides the neck, right? Oh wait, do you have one more? For the sake of brevity, can I roll one beard check? 43. 81. 86. 68, 19. 58. Do you think it matters? No. How about you get nothing else, and we move on? No last thing. Are we leaving him here? Yeah, you going to do something on his room, Keyleth? Double the guard on him. Two to Desmond. At all times. Is it? It's bound to happen. He's going to secede. Why not? I'm fucking bored. (laughter) What if we purchased a carriage? You would've. We're here, and we've got to go here. I don't think this looks very stable. No, they ain't coming. I tie up all the horses to a very large tree. Who else needs to go across? You want me to go first? We tied them up. Me too, because mountains are my favorite-- 23. I jump and try and grab Vex. That's what I said! I grab her. Five. What's a harpy? I'm bored as shit. No. 27. I go over and I grab Scanlan-- I put Scanlan down. Find a large rock that's tumbled down, maybe. And I discus the thing and (whoosh). Well, that was great. 24.
