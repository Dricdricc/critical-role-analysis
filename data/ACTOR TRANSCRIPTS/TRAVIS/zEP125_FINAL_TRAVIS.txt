That's something. What would you do every week without sponsorships? You would explode. As a player of Far Cry 4, it was amazing. I have higher expectations for 5. Yeah, it's real good. ATVs, baby! Sorry. But good friends never let you forget, Matt. Yeah. Let's get our own Sea Org and we'll give out ranks. I like Girl Scout cookies. How'd you do? Lots of gifts, then? He's in Zadash? Like, staying here? Isn't that hard since he's not technically recognized? He plays lots of local clubs. Yeah. Up and coming. Enjoying a resurgence. Were you with anyone when he showed up? Do you think he'd want to meet us? Or introduce us, maybe? Perception check. First one! That's an 11. Yeah. (whispering) I don't think he's here. That is problematic. Well. A hood? Yasha, do you have any kind of communication with your-- Yes. I don't think it was more than a few days. I don't recall exactly. Do I recall exactly? By a few days, I mean a couple weeks. I think that's more of an appropriate estimation. Oh yeah, Jester, that's got to take a while to get there and back. Of course. Now, is she supposed to send you stuff here? We'll have to hang out until it shows up, then. You're shabby? Yasha makes a good point, though. Just in case a simple wipe-down was enough to gain you entry. We've got to tackle this job at some point. Yeah, it's a sewer nexus with a beast with webs. Yeah, because we'll have bank and then we can get room service and shit. Did they give you a hall pass or something? Is it just a key or is there a thing that dangles from it, something we could mimic and make more of? Jester, can I see it real fast? Oh. Thank you. I take a real good look at it in case I want to fucking Minor Illusion that shit later. It gets real turnt up when this here starts playing. A silver?! Fucking start small, man. Now the beat's all off. Yeah. I've been looking at some of the folks around here. I think they're over-exaggerating the importance of this beast. Yeah, I think we should at least go down there and take a look. Nah. I don't think so. I'm not a super fan of the sewer during the day. I figure I'll like it even less at night. Ooh, yeah. Do we know where that guy is? The guy that came running back. That Voloshin said that one of them ran back from the task. Yeah. Good thinking. How long does it take to get over to the Tri-Spire area, find us a manhole? Is it early afternoon or late afternoon? We'll be fine. Yeah, why not? We're definitely going now. Hey, let's do it. You'll walk your buzz off. Not with your nerd goggles. How about we casually make our way over, and as we're doing that we can keep an eye out for kingsguard and see if they know of this guy? One of those shitty dueling shawls that they throw off? Warren T. Rat in American Tail. Oh, Jesus. Please no. Yeah, this is your opportunity to shine. Get 'em. Explain what we're doing. Oh. Seems reasonable enough. Do you know if the sewers flooded any time during the day? Any sort of unexpected water flows? When people ask you who were those brave souls that ventured into sewer, you tell them The Mighty Nein. SAM and Who's first? Yeah! Get in there, tank! Yasha? No, he just closed it, Jester. What do we think? Go up or down? Up, right? I put the glove of blasting on my left hand. What the fuck did you just draw? If you ever make a road sign, people are fucked. That is-- Yep. That's some old fucking Street Fighter combo shit. You really want to go south? You two? I like that logic. Bobby Tarantino territory. Let's do it. Let's go south. Asshole. (laughter) Nobody is going to ask you why you know that. Just so we're clear, you don't need to explain anymore. I think maybe we should head back in the opposite direction. Since you're tasting hemorrhoids in the water, it's probably coming from that direction. Let's do it. The curved surface of this area, can we see the ceiling clearly or is it way above us? Dust? Yeah. Swords in the middle. I'm going to go ahead and cast Armor of Agathys, get on the spectral frost armor. It's the snowcone variety. Scratching sound's a rat and we're all like (whimper). It's actual shit. 20 as well. Natural 20. Zero. I'm a limited fucking warlock. I turn to see where all of them are in relation to the party. Are there any sons of bitches over here that I can't see? Okay, great. I turn around and I see Caleb being flanked by two of them, and I know he is super squishy. Can I run towards this rat? Can I reach back with my hand and-- That hits. The rat takes ten points of frost damage. I reach back to strike the rat. As my hand comes down, I'll summon the falchion into my hand and strike down. No. It was one-handed, so 1d8. Ten points of damage. Oh, shit. Yes, it does. I got nervous! (gagging) (laughing) I have reservations about killing a sewer dog. You could flip it blade-up. It's in my mouth! That shit doesn't work. Punching the fuck out of rats. Fuck you, you dirty rat. It's down here! It's rats, we're not using that shit. (laughter) Ray! (laughter) Save. You got it, smash it. You're rolling the bad dice again. You gotta look in the camera. Oh good, yeah. Yup. Nostrils are burned right the fuck out. You know this really isn't what we need. This is only the appetizer, maybe we should try to find the main course. Yeah, I think stealth would be a good idea. To the right. Or just don't disturb them. 18. You normally touch a spider's web, they come running. Can we see a past that into any further clumps of webbing? 14. Do we have to break any of the planes of webbing to get to this cluster? Quite a while, but I'll remind you that our mission is not to retrieve any guards. It's to kill this beast. That was dark and angry. Shall we move forward to the first plane of webbing that would hinder our movement? Does it interact with the environment? What do we like more? Poking the webbing, or sending it up in flame? Might as well-- My way of thinking is what if that web is sticky as shit. I don't want to get caught in it. How about a poke and then a flame? That way Nott doesn't have bad dreams that we burn some people that are still alive and then we can set it all on fire. Oh, right. So they're dead, huh? Firestarter! How about four on one side and three on the other of the tunnel? I'll take the front of the other side of Yasha, since I've got some armor. Wow. Fucking betrayal. Okay. Hey Nott, will you do me a favor and make sure nothing sneaks up behind us? Could be. Can I search for puncture marks? Stab wounds? Bite marks? Ten on the medicine check. So big fangs. Probably fucking pincers. You know (clicking). Yeah. So watch your shit. How's the ground that we're standing on now? But the stone is unim-- Not tacky. The worst kind of candy. Or if we go up to the grate, and try and get someone to open the hatch in case we need to beat a speedy retreat. Yeah, do it. Give her the writ of law thing. Is there an A in that? If you had to ballpark the distance to the halfling or to the very end of it? I am going to join Nott at the back and keep an eye on the rear. Ten. Against my 14? Yeah! I do, so he takes ten points of damage. The armor is gone. Shit! 17. Fuck! Oh, look at the webs! Invisible shit ass bitch! Nipples on a horse! I have 15, as well. Nobody has higher than a 15? Yeah, I mean besides Jester. You're both 13? Good, separated from everybody. Nothing happens? Okay, can I spin back after getting fucking bit by a goddamn spider, and can I back up-- 10, 15, 20. Does that cause anything to hit me? Cool. I don't see nothing, right? Nice. Can I fire Eldritch Blast in the direction that I saw it? Yeah! 17. It moved! (laughter) I need to see it to do anything else. All right. Oh fuck! Oh, no. Shit, that's another 23. Two 19s in a row. Damn! Okay, constitution saving throw. Oh, that's an eight. I'm unconscious. No! Relentl-- The thing, I got the thing! It's called Relentless Endurance! I come back to one hit point! Sorry, I'm half dead. Oh fuck. What dice are you using? Yeah, this is the second fight. Fuck yeah, beast mode. As you rush towards it with a large arc, slamming down like (whoosh), you carve through part of its carapace, two of the eyes are cloven through and are now bloodied and ruined. I'm going to take a healing potion. Yeah. It's my turn. With my bonus action, can I cast Hexblade's Curse on the spider? With the fucking glove of blasting, that we took off the thing, can I go (grunting) and fire all three of the Scorching Ray balls at the spider? That's a nine, plus two for 11. That's a one. 16. That's right. Eight points of damage. Plus two to hit, that's it. No, damage two, proficiency. Thank you. Ten, thank you. Yeah. You just got to kill the spider and I'll be fine. Woo, crit on that shit! (bass guitar sounds) What the fuck?! No, she's path of the zealot. What's that called, what did you use? You don't need to heal me. If it dies, I gain seven hit points. Thanks, Jester. I owe you one. We're not considered poisoned if we got bit, right? I'd like to move closer to the group. (counting) I turn here and I will hold my attack. Yes. I don't get a ranged? Yeah. Do I have to say ranged spell attack? Sorry. I've learned. Ooh. I like the risk. You got it! Don't move, don't move! I regain seven hit points. I'm going to kill the half-- no. Far Cry 5! Fantastic multiplayer and all-new setting. It takes place in the United States of America. That's right. I even heard you could check it out. Ubisoft's Far Cry 5. Jagged at the tip. I hate spiders. I'm fucking out. Oh, the pouches that you took? Gold. He dies first. 85, 210-- I have no coin, willing to offer many gifts. Pretty sure we can call for someone with our-- How many of these victims were other than crownsguard? Any civilians or women, children? Well, what did you find on the bodies? Sorry. Yeah. What did we find? Nice. Anything unique? Any unique things? Sure. Can I happen to see-- am I able to see the guy with all the tattoos of ships and stuff? Oh, cool. Do I recognize any of the names of ships, or any imagery? Ugh. 11. Yeah. Insight check. (laughter) One way to find out. I'm just waiting. Nott? Oh. Well, wasn't the plan to have a, what did you call it? Oh Jesus Christ. Garmin over here. If I may, you raise a good point, Nott. If we for some reason get caught being where we're not supposed to, I think that writ only allows us to kill this beast and return it for the coin. I would not want to gamble with our reward of 700 gold. Perhaps we should leave and collect our reward and then find our revelries elsewhere. This is a good point. We can walk. Yeah, the King's Hall. Dinner. Yeah, Mighty Nein, stay back. Nein. (laughter) Yeah. Indeed, in fact it would turn invisible when it wasn't trying to stick its fangs into all of our gang. With that accent, all those letters disappear. Don't punch him, don't, no. Nein. Oh yeah. I'm moderately okay at this! Oh no! Okay, deception, where the fuck is it? Oh, it's 11. Who picked up all those items, anyway? We're staying over at the-- Although some of us were taking up at a room at the-- 700 gold. Of course. We appreciate the law in this town, and the services you provide. You can lean on us for any further needs you might have. Yeah. "A shitty hole." (laughs) "A shitty hole." Yeah, but it hasn't changed at all. If anything, later in the day it gets worse. I'm just letting you know. We do have some extra coin. Maybe he's got some fancier shit to buy. For someone who knows the exact time of night, you are shit with directions. Agreed. Should we head back, clean up? Yeah? Sure, if you'd like. I'm not repeating that word. Wow. Wish I had that before. Yeah, I think a trade would be fine, but I'll trade you for a story of why your past is so checkered with flame. You seem to trust in me enough to tell me about it. That's too bad. Sure. You know, we've all harmed people, but I hope that you will learn to trust me, in time, and I appreciate you sharing that. Here, I'm fairly certain that you will do far more damage with this than my shitty attempt did. Of course. Thanks for the armor. What does it look like? (laughter) All good things. Thank you for this. Yeah, you're welcome. We're going to get clean first, because good god, we're going to clear out that fucking tavern. But Matt-- I'm certainly not trying to hide it. Grumpy-ass wingman makes me look better in comparison. Who? Which one? I shuffle in with like a towel. Nott! What the fuck! (laughter) Shoo! Shoo! (laughter) Oh, with the buzzed head. Of course. (quietly) Don't talk. Well, we come from all sorts of different backgrounds. I happen to be very handy at sea, know my way around a merchant area. Beau? At times, we can be quite quiet. I would say it's safe to say that they don't have sentiments opposed to yours. Just letting you know that coin always helps, but we did see the posting outside the King's Hall about uprisings against the Empire. It seems the heat on your group might be quite intense. What cancers are you looking to remove? I would tell you that tomorrow night, the devil lies in the details, and that will depend. Good night. Wow. That was really good. Like, you didn't act like a total shitfuck. Whatever it was, yeah, lock it in. That was great. Really nice. That was promising. About that? I mean, shit, I can't really speak to it. I have to figure out what they want to do tomorrow. That's right. If it's amateur hour, we're going to be shooting ourselves in the foot. No joke. Especially since we just got here. Yeah, what the fuck? MARISHA and Beer? Okay. Hey. I wasn't sure what our next engagement might be, but it seems like we might not have to wait that long. Well, not through the city per se, but remember that group that we joined the other day? No that is not at all, no, no. We joined their meeting, right? We did not join them, we didn't participate-- We were in the presence of an attended meeting of individuals. Maybe it's just us, we just go, fuck these other-- Tomorrow evening there's going to be a meeting of that same group and they would like to hire our services. Why? Am I speaking real loud? Do you want me to write it down? Okay. I'll write it down for Jester, but for everybody else-- (laughter) Well, since it's in the same place, it's in the same cellar, I figure you guys can keep watch above while we're getting info down below. We don't all need to be down in the same place. Where's your cat? Was it one kick? Just one. You'd have to, you get kicked into a fucking other dimension. Did you get a name or a face, I mean, are we going-- That's really hard to do, very small and hard to catch. And in the south. Wait, so we all just got clean and we're going to get back into the sewers to get to the Tri-Spires? How about we dive bar it tonight, then? Start a tab, we're looking to tie one on tonight. We're celebrating. Killed a fucking giant invisible spider, friend. I appreciate that. Can I ask your name? Nice to meet you, Clive. Noticed some tough-looking types out front. I know, I know! He's just locked in. Orc-ish blood. Thank you, Jester. Clive, we're not looking for any trouble. Is there any music or is it just low murmured conversation? We walked into the Russian Mafia! Do you have a menu? You don't, you don't. The tattoo is familiar or he's familiar? Does the floor look barren? Wood? Any rugs, coverings? We did a little recon. Have we slept after our spider bite? Are these your type of people? With some quiches, and some mimosas-- University of Virginia, you'll find it.
