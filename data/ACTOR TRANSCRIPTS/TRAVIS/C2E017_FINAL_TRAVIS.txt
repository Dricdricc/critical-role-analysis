You suck! Oh my god. It just gets better! Can I ask how you spell "doy?" Due to unforeseen circumstances-- Just a Vidal Sassoon face right now. Me. Don't wake me. (high voice) Well struck, my lord! (knocking) Y'all up? We're going out. I can hear them. I think we're going to head downstairs if y'all want to join. It's general revelry. You know drink, eat, dance. Take that tuna away. Slow burn. Are there any people, I don't know, juggling and shit? Or any shows going on? Yeah, I want to see. I start walking towards the-- Trebuchet sounds pretty fucking sweet. How the fuck do we know? We're going to find out, though. Yes. Most definitely. Yeah. Here's ten copper for Molly and me. Oh shit. No, it's all right. Let me try it on my own first. For dignity's sake. I didn't need that disadv-- That's a natural one. (laughter) Sorry, friend. Yeah, that's a purple heart, sorry man. Jeez. Find her a soothing-- something to take the pain off. No. I've got this. Resituate. Grab a bit of a glance. (grunts) That's another natural one. This happened at Ren Fair before. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but let's give it a try. That's what I mean. I got them helping me. Two shit throws in a row. It can't get any fucking worse. (coughing) I think that might have-- I'm going to get a drink. You guys carry on. Ow, my pride. ASHLEY and We suck at this. Is it red? How much for a strawberry? All right, what was the other game? Forget this. N-- No. They needed this catharsis, it feels like. TALIESIN Quite a party. Meat or mead? Slightly vinegar. Oh yeah, good choice. They're celebrating anything these days. Yeah, the day is young. Not play, crush this game. Two swings. Come on, Yasha! I'll toss in a gold piece just to make it interesting. For the game, right? Sure. Two in a row. Nott. It's okay. No, it gets stuck in your teeth. The little girl disappeared into the crowd, or did she join a bunch of other kids? Creepy little doll, man! Yasha, do you eat rat a lot? Alive, or do you cook it? Nott, be real careful with that doll; they put little spirits of kids in those. Yeah, I'll go. Wow. This is top knot dude? Calm your mind. Just steel your mind. Dig in! Thought you were going to beat him. Marrow Keeps? Yes. Come on, Gunther. Have we met Gunther before? Is he human? (coughing) Me? Yeah. You know. It's not good to arm wrestle 30 minutes after eating a caramel apple. Your rat diet. No, I mean, from in your past. Good constitution. Yeah, come on. Let them know. Yasha, don't hold back. Don't look at him. Are you still raging? Wow. The ushe. I'm afraid she's spoken for. Oh boy. Do I trust your face? Yeah! All right! You've fought in this Victory Pit before? Oh. Where were you at? Lots of them around here? Okay, shall we go into the Victory Pit? Yeah, we'd like to enroll in the competition. Yes. Maybe it's like a cook-off. Well, of course. We are the illustrious Mighty Nein. Servants of Zadash. All parts. I forget. Refresh my memory about what the fee is for entering this contest. Yeah, I believe that entry fee is along the lines of what I remember. 20 gold will be fine. We know there are. I mean, that's what we're looking for, right? Our friends, the Stubborn Stock, said that this was the thing to do for people of our mettle. Could you tell us who the other two groups are, besides ourselves and the Stubborn Stock? Of course, yeah. Fjord. Here, 20 gold. For the other groups. Well, I have no idea what we're going to face. We don't know that. Yeah, go for it. Amazing. Fuck. What's going down? I agree with Molly. Are there crownsguard in the little waiting area that we're in? Can I make my way to one that's over by the entrance? Man, I cannot wait to see this year's Victory Pit competition! I hear the beasts are heartier than they were last year. Which one is your favorite so far? The beast they selected this year. Really? Man, I heard you guys were more informed than that. Really? Sheesh. What do you got to do to get duty like that? Where do the handlers of those beasts stay around here? Fair enough. You feel like dropping a coin on a team, remember The Mighty Nein. I walk away. What are you going to do about the flying creatures? Indeed. Yeah. Natural one. Yeah. Nine. Yeah. No, nine. Yeah, bring it out! Put me behind that wall, yep. Oh, good. Or the other one's invisible. Yep. Oh, shit. Ladies first. Can I turn towards the beast, and I'll cast Eldritch Blast at it. That is a 23 to hit. That is a ten plus four, 14 points of damage. Can I roll back behind cover? Even a couple more. Out of view, there we go. Sentinel! Rock that shit. Goodnight Irene, let's go. Big nope. If you go reckless, you can. So nonchalant with that shit! Where are you at, Jester? Hit point-wise? You want a health potion? You want a health potion? I think you should save-- Because you got stabbed with poop-teeth. Yeah, fucking take it. Did it look like they prepared anything with fire before the creature came out? They used cover really well. We should try and hide ourselves better. Nott had a great idea actually though. We should keep our distance. We don't. You people that need to be up close, just wait until it gets to you. Make him chase you for a bit. Use the cover. Let's put some damage on it before-- Jester, and Molly. Oh no. No, that isn't me either. Six. Yeah. Round two. Oh, fuck me. Oh god. Oh. 12. Ooh! 13, yeah okay. I'm going to cast Armor of Agathys on myself, and I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Hex on the wolf that's nearest to Yasha and give it disadvantage on dexterity checks. I'm going to use my movement to run towards that wolf. Mm-hmm. In between Molly and Yasha. Stay out of the cone, get on the backside. Huge! With my bonus action, can I transfer my Hex onto this wolf, and can I start running around to get to its right hindquarter? Staying in melee, but getting on its rear. Mm-hmm. Can I keep coming this way a little bit more? Yeah, right there. I reach back, and as I start to swing my hand up, I'll summon the Wastehunter falchion and slice up through it. That's 26 to hit. 13 points of damage. One d6 necrotic for another four, so 17 total. Nein! Fuck, it really is. Come on. Tell us how you taxidermy it. Yasha, Yasha. Could you give it to one more? Do you have to spare? Okay, I'll take some. Okay, great. They pass out when the manacles go on? I'm tapped. Plus somebody's going to be super danger close right off the bat. We've got some super squishy people in here that won't make it past-- All right, if that's what you guys want to do. I'll go take one of the doors. For the record, I do not like this plan. You should get some distance. Any ideas? The idea is that whatever doors they come out of will get one surprise round and then whoever's by those doors better be able to take some damage-- You don't want to be near me. You should be in the middle, able to move. Yeah, there are four doors right? I don't know if the map is accurate to how many doors there are-- Fuck that, no, no, no we've got to get in the middle. This is a terrible plan. There's too many doors. There's those four others besides the one we came in? No, no, we got to come in the center, we got to take advantage of the sentinels. That's the point of the feat. We're spread way too fucking thin. Go back in the middle like we thought we were going to do. (shouting) My door, my door! Two spines in the side. Oh my God. (laughter) My door! Yep. Oh, my god.
