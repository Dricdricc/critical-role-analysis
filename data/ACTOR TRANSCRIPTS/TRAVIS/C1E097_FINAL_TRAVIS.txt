Wow. Thank you, Melissa! (muffled) Fort Worth, Texas? (muffled) I went to college there! (muffled) No, I'm good. Kill them all before we change our mind. (laughter) Was it a thousand-foot cliff? Under the water. That's three diving tanks for competitive diving. Test it! Before you hit the water? They do glide. He's taking a picture of it! There's too many dice to roll, Marisha. Why would you even tempt that shit? That's instant death. You jumped from 1,000 feet in the air. Totally logical! You can't even see the water or rocks, but you're like, yep! I've got this, bitch! That took care of it! So the goldfish turned into orange marmalade? I mean, you can't feel bad about it. It's like a red-haired The Ring. Yeah. Good. Just a little drop. Is yours broken? I think mine's broken! Is there a cloud of red in the water? A thousand feet was all you needed. She's covered in gore, right? Wait, did you miss? Did you hit? Yeah, you fucked up. That was crazy. We should go on a hunt. That's what we need. Keyleth, did that hurt? Did it hurt? Blackness? 5th level? Yeah! Look how much red is all over you! Yeah, you're covered in shit. We'll never beat that death. We were in a huge fight with a fake thing that did no damage and you killed yourself in four seconds. We're gods! (vomit sound) Unreal. Couldn't write it. Either way, you were really screwed. Gods. Dead. Five Seconds. Hard to beat. You have chocolate on your face. Yeah, the thief. That's a good idea. Give me all your stuff. What? A background check? Shambala? I don't know. Do you? With this talk of reading? A little bit. Yeah, let's not get ahead of ourselves, all right? I had a quick thought. If her husband's dead, are we just going to tell her that right now? Just you know, husband's dead. He's being eaten by fish. That doesn't seem right at all Yep. Pike and I are in agreement. Plus, he was in somewhere like shambalam. Yep, she might have killed her husband. Pretty sure she did it. We are background checking a fucking bakery employee in our Dungeons and Dragons game! Yeah, me too. Luck? Are we reading right now? I found one! Look! Bus-ee-ness. Buseness. Bus-ee-what? LAURA, ASHLEY, and Sound it out. Bus-eye-ness Boysness. Can you use it in a sentence, please? Or-chid. Or-chide. LAURA and No, it's not kid. It's an orchid business. Boysness. Which is a location in Marquet. She can shoot her arrow-- Because they say it, it's true. I look for a book on werewolves. Natural 20! (cheering) I take it with me. That you died? Wait, Shadowfell? Have you been to this Shadowfell before? I'm going to reset Keyleth's brain. I'm going to jog her memory. Literally nobody needs to go there but her. I'll help you go read, too. And I start reading my book. Brushing your teeth? Yeah, because they took him away in it. It was Ralph's cream puffs. And you had to lose that one. They are in workouts! (mouthing) What's her name? Mariya and Howaardt? Just say no. (laughing) Is that the cloud hiccups? Did we beat him here? A few miles is better. He's doing trigonometry. Should we set a fallback? I'm going to go 200, 300 yards back towards the city, just in case they manage to get through. Unassuming. Do drows have magic sight or anything? Not stealthing. I have to pee. It's like hide and go seek. The waiting. Yeah. Remember that? What about the horse. Does he fall off? I'm going to eat it. Dinner! Nice. That's huge. Yeah! Get in there, Barry Allen. I'm writing my name in the path with a stick. You were just supposed to bring Tary back to his dad? Tary, I thought you left your home. Or were you kicked out? Yeah? Are you armed? Somebody remove her weapons so she can put her arms down. You don't want to see her dead? Yep. She did surrender. I'm just thinking, maybe we go in, she gets paid, she keeps her reputation, and then you can-- And she surrendered, right? Maybe she owes us one after this. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe she owes us one. K'ryyn, would you like to owe us a favor if we let you live, and get you paid, and you keep your reputation all on the same day? Noted. All in favor of getting her paid, letting her live, and earning a favor? What are you doing? Oh, this is a bit much. Like a two-day report. Boring. But I want to find Scanlan! How much of her brains were left in the rocks? Yeah! Got to do it. Simplest. The shortest distance between two-- Yep. Is-- Marriage. Yep. Don't be jealous. Are you cool with your sister? Is she married? What if we offer services, and they excuse part of the debt? That's harsh. Whoa. Technically, I've got a lot of money. Not going to say that ever again. Don't do it, man. They tried to make me wear bells. Don't let them hold you down. Yeah, you don't get to keep eyes on me all hours of the day. Yeah, raging, reduced to half. Yep. A lot. There's not a lot of real sound family structures in this campaign. Let this be a lesson. You're so dark, man. Why do you make this shit up? What? Yeah, great take-off, action was amazing. The finish, though, the landing--
