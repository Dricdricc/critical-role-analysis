That's a lot of blood. Yeah! Now, I think this is September's theme. Stark Motor Racing. Is this really a hood ornament? I used to break those off of the front of people's cars when I was a kid because I was an asshole. I got it! We made more! What is that voice you're doing? (laughter) Yeah, it's getting cold, so make sure you bundle up nice and warm. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Patriots. Wait, did she originally take Percy's gun? Was that what she was using? Should we collect her gun now? Well, let's collect those. Quickly. Yes? I would love to use my teeth for that. No, I'll use the axe. This one, right? Bag of Colding. I forgot, are we killing him? Not anymore. Yeah. Where am I taking him? Can I ask, is Orthax still here? That's who that was, right? Oh, I was going to ask the question of could he help us with Percy. Yeah. Well, let's try and get him back first before we get upset about it. Yeah. How do we move? That'll be too slow. How long? I don't remember, do we have a way to call Pike? Or can we bring her to us? Is that correct? Which one? Oh, regular bag. Can I see the little stone with the runes on it? Kynan, what is this? What about the little latch box that's closed? Read that. So you haven't been inside? What if that was her escape route? What if there's a way out? Good thing? Okay, so just cut off your foot as a tithe. We stow it. What healing spells? Then we rest now, yeah? Hard choices, but we have to help ourselves if we plan to help him. I say save it and rest. That's my vote. Voice your opinions now. Do it. Then let's summon the mansion and do this. I'll go get them, because I'm still doing pretty dandy and I'll absorb all the glass shards from walking around. Okay. If you two want to go check the cavern, I'll collect all the guns and check the bodies of the people that are down. Guns and bodies. Nice. Oh, minus two. 15. Full plate? Okay. For the pistols? Got it. 26 rounds. I have. Those Bracers of Defense need to be attuned? Okay. Not yet! Shall we? I didn't have blankets. Fine. With us. I reach into the bag of holding, and I take out one of the ten expensive-ass bottles of wine. I take out two of them. I de-cork two. I hand one to Vex and one to Keyleth and say It'll be a hard night, but you both have to sleep. Drink this, and we will attempt to remedy this when we wake. The best thing you can do for your friend now is to sleep, so do that. Save your tears for later. And we sleep. What? Kynan, is it? Do me a favor. Sulk around this group a little bit later. Otherwise, I might kill you right now. So fall in line and pick your chin up. Whitestone. I have Percy over my shoulders, fireman carry. Yeah, around my shoulders. Yeah. No. Fireman carry. We're here with you, Pike. Oh, how grief does strange things to people! What if we carve his name back onto the barrel? Or go to Orthax. Didn't you detach Craven Edge from me? Didn't you sever a thread? Didn't that happen? Yeah! I don't even remember, and it happened to me. No excuse. That was right. That's what severed it. On the gun. She could see a thread that was connecting us. What is that? Get your monkey ass back in that chair! What do you remember? I want to insight-check Pike. (laughter) 11. Pike! That was very clever, Pike. Did you thank her for the necklace? We should all go back to the castle, then. We have two Vestiges to show them. What about the other Vestige? SAM, LAURA, and We gave them a bunch of water. I honestly would like to make a case for it. Just consider one thing I chase people around the battlefield. And I really have a hard time getting to them sometimes. It'd be really great to travel 50 feet, then throw another 60, and then be right on their fucking asses. I'm just saying, for consideration. Obviously, daggers are your bag, baby. Do I need to be attuned to Whisper? Somebody else can have it. Simple tricks? An old wooden music box? Scanlan, isn't there anything else you need to deliver to one of these two fine gentlemen? No, I believe there is something you acquired for one of these two gents. Why are you calling spice "ice-spay?" Oh shit. Open that. What time of the day is it right now? Yeah, we could certainly let you sleep. Take a fucking nap, man! We'll convene in the morning! Yeah! Yeah, little Pike! Yeah, I give her a fist bump with the gauntlets, and the knuckles. Oh, Pike, you're getting too strong for your own good! Can I walk over to Vax? So I'm assuming you're taking this little chick under your wing. No, but you're sure he's clean? He's pretty spaced out. Pike, do us a favor and give him a once-over. Make sure there's no funk on him. We're having Pike check-- Wait, Jarett! While we were in your hood, I acquired this delicious little bit. And I pull out the sandkheg bottle. This is called Seraph's Swine Swallow. And I pour a little into a glass and I hand it to him. Yeah, and it's all in one. Hit the back of the throat and swallow it all in one. Yes. To friends, and to health. And to fukasa. Sukasa. Mi casa. (laughter) 14. I take his cup. I pour a little, and I'm like, can't let him take this ride by himself. I pound it, as well. Not great. 13. (slurred) I think so, too. (slurred) You're talking really funny. Let's braid each other's hair. (slurred) I can't understand what you're saying. (slurred) It is the best! (slurred) Pike, do you want a little bit? That's my monster! And I pour her a little glass. That was the whitest drop-in beat ever. What?! (slurred) How do you feel, Pike? I pour her another one. (slurred) Yes, she's got quite the tolerance. (slurred) Pike? Pike. Can I try to pick her up by her collar and try to hold her up? Is she just limp? (slurred) Well, that's one way to go for the night. Yeah, no. I put it in the bag of holding. (slurred) Did you know that it comes from a venomous part of a big animal? (slurred) Didn't I say that? That was my fault. I go lay Pike in a booth or something. I'm over here. (slurred) Jarett, I'd listen to him. It's not very often he offers to get people off. What, you read it? Yep. A what? Are we all reading it, or just you two pricks? I'm going to kick his fucking ass. Yeah, he did! He said he could have wiped the floor with me! Highbrowed? So do we plan to act like we didn't read it, or are you going to try and slip it back in his pocket without him noticing? Was it sealed or anything? Yeah. Try and sneak it in. Don't know if we all need to write. I walk up and shove Vax into the tray of glasses. Pike, what did you do to all these cups and trays? Yes! I'm very disappointed. You should apologize to the owner. I flip her a gold coin. Welcome. All right, let's go home! I pick up Pikey. You came into our home with that shit?! Are you fucking kidding? Okay. He's been this way the whole time?! I knew that. I don't know if the rest of you did. Thank you to Loot Crate. We set a crazy new record tonight.
