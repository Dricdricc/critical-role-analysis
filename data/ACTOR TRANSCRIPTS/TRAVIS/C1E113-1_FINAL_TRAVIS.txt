I played Commanding Orc #1, and I scream like this and I will be chasing you as you try and make your way through the lands, and I escalate my ambitions through the war ranks! I just made that up. She's super bad. Just like a normal elf. Not a very affable-- Does he hate the player, or does he hate the game? You hear Darin and you're like, he was definitely an orc forever. Oh gosh, I guess we should, being that we don't even know. We're figuring it out as we go. Should I start? (high squeaky voice) So I'm playing I am Skak Scar-Artist, and I'm a goblin. A trickster. Very creepy! Yeah. I'm a little goblin that's got a crossbow and a shortsword, and I'm here to run amok and advance, you know, my efforts against the horrible humans and elves of the land of Mordor. Great outpatient. (high-pitched whining) I'm just bored, that's all. Is that an option? We could do that, now? Ooh! Naw, I think it's Oog, and it's actually Oop-tha. Yeah, you get them easily confused. He keeps doing this, with the two things. Nothing. You're always-- I'm a fan of gold as well. Yeah, that's true. Not a problem. Could I have, could you hand me--? It's really high up there, right. Okay! I've got it! Was I supposed to do that? Yeah, hold on one more second. Yeah, here you go. I take out a crossbow, do I see any intruders? 12! I don't understand! Those are uruk! Why are they firing at us? Yeah! Oh, shit! One. You need to be on your game! Come on! Am I far enough away to pick one off with my crossbow? Okay! Crossbow, 1d8. Oh, that's good! That is 11. No, no, no! 16. I know, it's way off. Thank you. Yes! d8. That's a 15. Well, 1d8 plus four. So nope, that's wrong. That's a six. Six damage. 3d6? Holy smokes! Five, six, ten. 11 total. Sneak attack. Got one! There's only two things you need to call me. No, that's me! I'm the Scar-Artist! You better pick the time you want to use it. Nice, Arby! 22. Go up the tower! Go! What about me? I thought I was at the top of the round, right? You know, because I went first with the sneak attack. Can I run up and draw my shortsword, two hands, and try and stick it in? 19. Shortsword, 1d6. Sneak attack, five, six, ten-- Yeah. Because somebody's within melee. 12 points of damage to his gut! A beautiful scar to add to my collection. It makes 30. You are. As a collective? Do we vote? Is it democracy? Okay. Injured? On fire? It's nice, isn't it? Why are you being so polite? I'm just carving little scars into the dead body. Yeah. Oh, powerful Barfta! I am lowly Skak the Scar-Artist, to serve you. Captains! It's a figure of speech, Mozuu. Can I run across the room to the hole that was blown in the other side of the room, check for clues or how they did it, or if there's any trace of who came in? 25 on the investigation, and an eight on the perception. Explodey powder? Can I pocket those three? It's an eight. It's real blurry. Of you all, who has really good like, you know, eyeballs? Can you see anything out here? How long have you been holding those? Are you Gandalf? Oh shit. Amazing. Put those away. Ooh! Like a callsign! Yeah, hold on, just one minute! Your shoulder is finished, where do you want yours? Again, no. No wait, you need your tattoo, yours is done, it's on the lower back. Where would you like your Forcs tattoo? Yeah. Thank you. We'll get it later, we should probably get after them. Do we have any mounts available? See, I'm afraid that would be us, if we tried to ride them. Very much so. Yeah, I mean, look at them. I haven't. Not that I need it, but I will accept. (frantic noises) I'm to interpret the eyes? (laughs) That was good. Oh, that's a million. 22. It's got mosaic work, filigree! It's really nice. Oh good. Minus two. 14. I literally rolled a zero. Two minus two. 60 feet. The eyes speak often. They lead us forth. No. Shouldn't make any difference. Both the land and the beast speak to me through the eyes. I don't know if that's right. Extrapolate. 18. This is new for me, guys! (laughter) Wait a second. Yeah, we've all got experience with this. LAURA and Remember, they have a hard time with bright light! 18. How far away are they? I would like to take out one of my acid vials, and I'm going to throw it from atop your shoulders at the two ghouls coming forward. Using Acid Splash. Can I use my bonus action to nimble escape, and I want to jump off your shoulders and hide. Nice. 20. No more eagles. Yeah! (laughs) Ding! I've heard this before about ghouls. Bright light! Wow. Said so casually! "I would like to bite and--" I jump out from behind where I'm hiding, and I load my crossbow at the one that's running, and I pull the trigger. Oh! 21. 12, right? No sneak attack? Right. Oh, it is sneak attack? (counting) 21. (pants) Forcs! (laughter) Yes, I remember they have a weakness to bright light, and they live in hives. We should go! Don't light it! I think it's an unlit torch. Don't hurt yourself. It's okay. We should go! Mozuu? What's on your face? You can't have two leaders. Delineating responsibility. Wow! How many are left? Two? Three? Are any of them within 15 feet of me? I want to try and cast Thunderwave. It's going to hit you guys, isn't it? It hits everybody. I definitely want to try to hit as many of you as possible. (laughter) May the dark lord grant me a Thunderwave? 14. 13. Can I bonus action my nimble escape? To hide? 15. No, 23. Stealth is plus ten! I'm used to the other. 23. How many of those explosive orbs did I use? All of them, or just two? Fair enough. Some of them are apparently explosive. Explosive! I totally heard law school. (screams) I take off running, too. Uncanny dodge! 11. (wheezes) I think they left us behind. Why do I sound like this? Yeah. We're clear! Forgot my inhaler. Ur-Eden! Wait! You're faster than I thought. She killed five of them. Yep. Made me leaver? Do I know which way is east? Nature check. Natural 20. That doesn't help with directions. That is east. Perception with advantage, or nature with advantage? That helps. 18. Yeah, I climb back up. (shushing) I see figures ahead. Three of them. Three of them! One on guard with a torch. Yeah, slit their throats while they're resting. No, we charge in! Dandruff scalp protein? The Forcs!
