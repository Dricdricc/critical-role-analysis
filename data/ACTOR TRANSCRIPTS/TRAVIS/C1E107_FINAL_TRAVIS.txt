I was educated. She's playing with her giant trash bag of dice. Yeah, pretty much. If you die, we will lower you from above like an angel on a fly reel. With some asshole swinging you from side to side. (yelling) I want to get down, I can't feel my legs! We planned this out way in advance. It's so good. It's scurry. I watch the show with the lights on 'cause it creeps me out. Once a year, y'all. Once a year. I can't die today, right? It's in my stomach. I mean, that was awesome. It's a little Pike cake! We didn't say anything. What do you mean lentils? What is that? What is a lentil? Is it a leaf? Is it a bean? Why on god's green earth is it even here? I don't understand. Really? That makes sense an hour from now when I get punished in the loo. You can make us breathe underwater, right? Can I have something of yours, at least until we see each other again? (sounds of distress) Ooh, the Bloodaxe? There you go! Mary Poppins handbag. (gasps) It's the sweetest thing ever. I tie it onto my necklace. Yeah, and if Vasselheim is attacked, you don't go saving the city all by yourself. I know what you're like. That's what I thought. All right. Bye, Pike. Hi, Pike! No lentils, right? Yeah, but we need it. Holy shit. Jesus, what the fuck? Do we Plane Shift? Remember, Delilah was already down there? She was in tunnels underground, right? We don't know if she's at this forge? So we go. Right? Do we go to the shore and then out into the ocean on a ship? The volcano is underneath the ocean. Underneath the ocean. We've only talked about it for four hours; it's okay. You never watched behind the scenes on Titanic? We go to the shore. I have a question, sorry. Did Pike come with us to send us off? Pike? You know you have-- what's it called you put on me one time? That Death Ward? Should we put that on one of us before we go, just in case it's super dangerous? One of the squishier ones? Does someone want Death Ward, so if you go down-- Yeah, no. Boulder-Parchment-Shears. Perfect opportunity. Yeah, come on. One time. One, two, three, go! Those two. Thanks, Pike. I thought it might help. Just in case. Nope! Nope. I like a little danger in my life. Do you want one? On my birthday? Come on! What are the chances? Cool. Good question. Right now?! You're sure? Do we take a boat now? Or do we find some dolphins and ride out majestically? You know, you're only talking to yourself. We all know. Hey, use your elven eyes, see if you can see it. Otherwise, we're walking five miles underwater. Look, Scanlan. The necklace is really nice on the inside. I can vouch for it. Why not? New experiences, right? Whatever it takes to achieve the mission. Thanks for your time. Three days? Not if we want to live. We priced it out once before, and it was like 30,000. Shanty's a fancy name for a mansion, right? Did you see her eye? It didn't move. How does that happen? Let's meet the crew. How many crew are there? Yeah, Scaldseat. The name of the boat is the Sea Shanty, but the captain is Santy. Can I look down into the hatch where he came from? Can I see anything? Two. There's rum down there. Down there? There is rum. Let's get shit-housed. Who cares what our responsibilities are? We haven't even left the dock yet. After all, we are going on a three-hour tour. Why do you say that? I will throw something. Jeez. Hold on. I saw you drop anchor. Do you have an idea of how deep it is here? Oh shit. The ship will be gone when we come back up. You got to do a proper paddy entry into the water. (splash) Do we have good visibility? 40 feet? 60 feet? Where should I be? Yeah. How about I'm the down-weighter system for whoever's in the front? I'll hold onto their ankles. You're breathing water. It's not necessary. There's no air in your sinuses. Quick question. Like in space, can we talk underwater if there's no air going through our vocal cords? Cool. Stop peeing, Vax. Do you see anything around us? You've got the Death Ward. Go for it! Should we walk around? The volcano, is it massive? There are tunnels that exist already. Man-made is not important. Yeah, what the location of the Anvil is? Starving. Or through rock. You can make tunnels, right? I would prefer to do that than go down the barrel of the shotgun, but that's just me. (garbled) No. (laughter) I'm just saying. Yeah, I forgot. He's like a crash test dummy. We'll worry about that later. What did you see? Yeah, but it might be worth it. We don't even know what the Core Anvil looks like. I mean, no. It might make another exhaust port for the heat and the water. You didn't see tunnels, right? You didn't see tunnels in the sides of the volcano? Because we're not trying to go down, we're trying to find the tunnels. Right. I don't know if we're trying to get to the inside of the volcano shaft. There's a chance the Core Anvil could be made of molten rock, right? There's nothing that says it's a not dangerous, totally cool to be around piece of thing. I'm not worried about it. Well, we've got to find whatever it is. We don't even know what it looks like! Yeah, when I was getting the upload from Morpheus, did I see what the Core Anvil might look like? Or was it just like, I'm just hammering and Rambo 2 montage music is playing. We need a walk. Walk the perimeter Yeah, caves. Oh, minus two. 17. Kind of. (garbled) Say my name, bitch! I do. Only if I'm raging. Hey! Oh, 26. I did, didn't I? Grog versus the volcano! Air pocket. Yeah, put your face in the water and breathe. Vex, will you look for anything that looks like a Core Anvil? And I stick my face in. Because you made a Wall of Stone. Do we want to get rid of the water, though? Because that's what's allowing us to breathe. Me in the middle. Yeah, of course. Air pocket. Do your Navy SEAL shit. Come out of the water, eyes open. I don't like the way he said that. The walls are cooling? We follow Vax. I don't know, but I love it. What? Nope. Awesome! It's just a thought, but I do have the big-ass jug that can make a big thing of portable water. Well, you can breathe in that shit, right? We won't be able to see. You're breathing it back out. You're recycling it. It'll get a little less oxygenated. Do you want to do that? Salt water or fresh water? Or wine. LAURA and I take out the Alchemy Jug and I say, fresh water. Are we underwater right now? Okay. I stick my head in it. Can I breathe? It works. It works! I'm holding it above the water. Don't downplay my special moment. I was looking at it, and I was like, fresh water, vinegar, oh! 21. 21. Oh, I think you barely got that in. I'm sorry, guys. 16. I have a feeling. Oh! You fucking didn't! That was a barrage. Can I quietly go into a rage? (laughter) I heard you saying it, too. It's huge. 19. What animal? Yeah, provoke the thing with its teeth closest to me. I'm just fucking with you. Thank you. I have advantage on those, but I won't need it because that was a 19. 21. 19. It's right on the paper. Negative two. Sorry. Thank you. Do I take that, too? Oh, I am, huh? How tall is the area that we're standing in? Ten to 12 feet? Yeah, I'm going to make both of my attacks at Mama Bear. Yeah, because I've got to move. Either I move and it senses the non-stealthy-- yeah, fuck it, I'm just going to take both of my Bloodaxe attacks at it with the first one Great Weapon Master. Not reckless. 21? Just barely? Okay. That's awesome. 26... 36 points of damage? Ooh, that's a problem. Okay. They're like xenomorphs. I'll take the second strike, as well. Great Weapon Master, not reckless. That's shit. That's going to miss, I think. Yeah. 20? Oh, really? 15. Because I said Great Weapon Master, it's minus five. Can I use my bonus action to rage or not? Fair enough. Ends my turn. No! I'm right next to it. You sang that better than my mother! Did I have a mom? Let me check-- yeah. It's always me! (laughing) It's always me. We've done this before. I'm well-versed. Blinded and restrained. Thank you! Every fucking time. Hi! I'd like to stand up. I would like to smash my Titanstone Knuckles together and cast Enlarge on myself. Gotta get some fire resistance because good god. Yeah, every time. Can I do reckless, Great Weapon Master? 26? Nice. 37 on the first. (singing) Happy happy (war cry). Should I try and push him out of the way? Yep, I'm going to (leaping noise) over the side, hardcore parkour. One-handed. Yeah, let's use the Boots of Feral Leaping. That's going to be a 26. 27. Towards you. Towards his left. Yep. And I'll move up. I do, don't I? Can I get around here on the ground? Yeah, I want to! Acrobatics. 16. I'm right there, yeah. The pit boss over here disapproves. Halved, because I have resistance from the enlargement now. We're just traumatized. As he herniates a disc. Can I look around for anything that resembles an anvil or a shelf or something that one might wackadoodle on? Nice. Watch me knock this out of the park. That's better. Still shitty. 11. The pathway still continues to descend around. What? Boners and wangs. You're not there. I think that's what we're looking for, right? Yeah, we're great entering doors. Great history with doors. Let's go. I've got the carpet. What about your bean? I don't want to jump the gun, but I did punch a volcano today. This door, probably not too big a tuna for me to filet, you know what I mean? Unless the runes say, "If you punch, melt you will." It didn't? Yeah. Oh, good point. Well, we don't know how wide. How wide? You could fly down and put me in the necklace, if you want. Good call. Let's try being polite, first. I will knock on the door. All right, fuck this. I try and push the door either in and to either side. 17. Oh yeah, I'll use that shit. Oh, it is? Oh shit. Awesome. 26. You got it. Natural 20. (laughter) I feel like this is it. (singing) Angel wang. Are the walls hot to the touch, since they're metal? We progress forward into the room down the stairs. Wherever the stairs lead. It's not working. Did one of y'all growl just now? That was you? Or did it come out of the speaker? That shit scared me. (laughter) I'm quick as hell. (laughs) I know. Ah! I'm so sorry! (laughter) No, he keeps all his stuff. Not some metal Medusa that turned them into metal? Please don't be golems that will come out and fight us. To what are you pointing? Right. Do I trust the art? Ooh. I start popping and locking. I don't actually mind taking the lead on this one. I think five to ten minutes, actually. You look over and Scanlan's going (kisses). I tried to talk to Pelor, but people were like, "No, don't talk to Pelor." What are you talking about? I'll go in. What's the floor look like from here to there? The same surface? Any seams, or just smooth? I move closer towards that. Hold on. 17. It's just the triangle shape, right? There's nothing else around it? And the coals are in a circle? (sighs) Might have to Tony Robbins this shit, right? Is there anything else in the room besides the two reliefs on either side that we can see? Tools? So we're supposed to smelt the platinum, right? Melt it down. And then we use our magic beans to make the Prime Trammels. And that relief is in the middle of two crossbeams? So you couldn't push the crossbeams over and lay it down flat? It's not something we have to lay flat. What did the reliefs have in their hands? Weapons? Swords? Axes? Hammers? Okay. Yeah, the coals are cooking. I'm going to walk across. Those crossbeams, do they look like they're structurally integral to the room? Oh shit. Oh my god, we're going right into it.
