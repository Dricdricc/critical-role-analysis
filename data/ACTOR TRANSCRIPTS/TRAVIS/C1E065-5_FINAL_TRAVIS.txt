I love it. Verboten from social medias. Yar. It's okay, it's Spanish. (laughter) Hey! This week's episode's brought to you by Lootcrate! The amazing Lootcrate, of which we have a new crate to unbox. Grab your boxes. Open up. This is their anti-hero box. This is their anti-hero box. Well look who's ahead of you, and immediately, I am greeted by an Archer shirt. Dude, we have Kill Bill socks. You are the biggest Hellboy nerd I know. And Harley. Ah, Harley. Just waiting for Mr J. Woo! That is your anti-hero Lootcrate box that is out right now. That's the Hellboy fist. Look at that. A sexual toy. A big red fist. And coming up, they have a speed-themed box. With a high-octane assortment of goodies, ranging from Batman, CW's The Flash, Arrow, Battlestar Galactica, Iron Man, Gone in 60 Seconds. It includes two collectibles, a figure, and, as always, our monthly t-shirt, and pan-speed. Coming next month. And if you have a style need, along with the speed collection, there are also some Sonic the Hedgehog socks. Being the voice of Knuckles, I don't know if they're red-- you know, because I'm clearly the fastest person in the show. They're probably blue? Fucking hell. All right, well, they're probably the little blue hedgehog's color. That's right. And you also have a Transformer's wearable for your world-saving needs. And a MarioKart tee. And as always, the promo code Lootcrate.com/criticalrole. Three dollars off your subscription. And a special message from this-- no, there's actually no special message. But maybe we'll work that in later. Oh, really? (laughs) China. I'm going to be walking around my house naked in an Archer t-shirt. Aren't they? And the LootBags, the LootPackages... Don't steal my stuff when the show is over. Come on in there. Come and sit down. The man is out of breath. Raise your hand. Oh, five of six. We've got some super-sized carry-on luggage. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, we'll be there. I've got naan in my teeth. My name is Tarvis. (laughter) Brilliance, inspiration incarnate. And I am a half-orc. I am smart as balls, y'all, 18! Quantum physics, that's my shit. And you're handsome. Let's get it on! Oh man! Oh, I'm ready to roll whenever everyone else is. Of course, Spireling. Never dream of it. A few marching orders before we begin. Obby and I work together a lot, so we're familiar with each other, wouldn't you say? Anywhere. Delweth I've been learning a little bit more about. Dren, not quite so sure what it is that you do. Good. How do you like to assassin people? With your hands? Nice. A little range action. Delweth, would you mind sharing with Devan what exactly you do to people like her in case she thinks about running off or leaving-- No, it's a hypothetical deal, you'll enjoy this. You know what? Dealer's choice. This is violence, not the other stuff. That was lovely, thank you for that. Yeah, that's really nice. Yes? Oh, did I not mention that, in the Clasp, yes, if you betray one of your own, we will turn you inside out and wear you as a hat. But Dren knows that You knew that already, didn't you? Does anyone have a preference? Marching order into the pipe. Really? I mean, I do, you want to tell them? I'm going to die, I wasn't ready for this. Brick in the wall? Yes, dear. I do. Hmm. You think it's trapped? Maybe we should have Dren touch it. You will? Did you want to give it a touch? Oh! How does it work upstairs? Good job, Devan. Proving useful. Was that our only torch? Hat, remember. She'll wear you as a hat. Could I check the partially open door? I would like to check it for danger. Oh, perception. Seven. They sure do. Well. Keep it up. We'll follow you. Obby? We found a secret door. We should leave him up there. No, you can come down from the number one and number two place. Devan, those dancing lights are awfully cute. Do you mind if I ask you how you came to be in the service of the Clasp? No. Why you're indebted to the Clasp? Dren. Boy golly gosh, that sounds so nice. Do me a favor. Gamble on your own time, don't gamble with our lives. We work as a team here, so those dancing lights down here are fine, but you check with Dren or her or him before you do that again. We clear? Good. Give Obby a hug for checking out that dangerous pipe for you. I would like to stealth into the doorway and, moving forward, be on the alert for traps. I don't normally stealth, so that's a weird sentence for me. I'm trying not to speak as Grog. 18. I'll be first through the door. I suppose you're right, Obby, maybe you should be the one to let her know that she can. Yeah. 16. Nothing yet, my dear. A haiku? Obby! Sure, Dren, we'd love to hear one. Don't. Move. I stepped on something that clicked. What do I see? Real quick, everybody check the walls, ceilings, floors, see what this might unleash. 18. The duration of the hallway? Maybe not, Dren. I like your enthusiasm, though. Yeah. Devan? You have some tricks about you, right? Any favorite spells that you like to use? The holes? One could say, you can certainly try. I appreciate your concern. Objections? I like your idea. Devan. How about you use your Ray of Frost on the holes, so that if anything decides to drop out of them, it meets a little stopper. Sure, Devan, I would like to do that. Shall we? As it appears, we'd like to do the old Indiana Jones like foot off-- Obby! Son of a bitch! Like trickles of acid, or like a shower of acid? Yep. You! 13. 13. Seven? Oh Jesus. I miss Grog right now! Oh, you know, I need a word with my good friend, Obby. Just a quick chat. Would you mind waiting here for one second? Will you keep your finger on the button? Can I make my way up to Obby, hopscotching over the puddles of acid that I can see? Obby, hey, Obby. You did panic. Why? That is a good question. Since you're so eager to make your way through the hall, would you mind leading the way for us, at a good 20-foot distance from the rest of us. As he goes off, I will also check the grounds around him. 14. You know, Obby, before they get here, it was opened earlier by Devan cutting her hand really really deeply. I meant to tell you, she cut it a couple times. Nicely done. Very useful. Does this look familiar to you at all? Are we looking for the basement? In the basement? Can I insight check Devan? 12? She's nervous because Obby is so attractive. The Clasp, we like to do things quietly. If we hear any rumblings of trouble, hide. Fair enough? Good. What's your relationship with her, by the way? Good terms, bad terms? Really? Dren, Dren. You have pockets? If we find a room of gold, you can fill your pockets. No worries. Your perception's zero? There is no one more jinxy than Laura. No one more superstitious. She runs up her dice more than a professional athlete, it's crazy. Are there any records, or binders, ledgers, things like that? Not sure yet. Do I recognize any code or a cipher in the writing? Nine. Okay. Dren, stay with her. Wolfman? Slider? Sundown? We will go to the door, and we will see if it's locked. No. Obby just grabs it. Is it lit by light or torch? Just leads to a stairway? Wood? Brick? Do we hear anything up the stairs? Dren, you're up. Be as tiny as you can be, and sneak up those stairs and see what you can see. There's a fox bat flying? All right. I motion for everyone to go up the stairs. Wait a minute. Did we check for hidden doors or passages? SAM and Yeah. There's three of them. Let's take the one on the left. And we'll push it. The one on the right. There was nothing on the desk? No switches, no-- I thought you've never been in this room. All right, as we go back up towards the stairs, can we check the walls for any secrets? Up the stairway. 22. Great, Dren, will you check that door at the top of the stairs for traps? (meowing) You recognize this room? Excellent. Delweth, Dren, go with her and explore. Wait. Who can check for magic? Yeah, that was bad. It's not on alarm. Here we go! We got a map! Where are the fucking trees? Nine for Tarvis. You get a bonus action. Want to use your bonus action to call for Dren? Hello, Grandmaster Flash. To me? Can I take my scimitar out? SAM, MARY, and And the chests that are on the wall closest to you, those five chests that are there. Can I move to the one closest to me and with my scimitar drag it along the face of all five of them as I run along them? Yeah, the scimitar. Yeah, dragging it across the front, not trying to penetrate it. Great. With my bonus action, I look at them all stuck in that stupid chest. You don't know. You don't know how long you'll be alive. Whoa, what the shit! Which one did you hit? ASHLY and Okay, I will go to big guy! Yes. And I will use a dagger to sneak attack his anus. Aw man, that's balls. Ten. Yeah. Who? We're so fucked. Me? Awesome. Still in the double digits. We're on me? She's got it. Hide, disengage, dash-- oh well you can't dash-- I would like to be useful in this fight in any capacity and would like to hop the chest and move towards the last remaining piece of shit. I'll take this scimitar. It's not engaged by anybody else right, so no sneak attack damage? I will be the engagee for everyone else and I will hit it with my scimitar because I'm such a good fucking leader. I'll roll a different dice. Jesus, nipples on a horse. Ten. Wait! Can I use my bonus action to disengage? I know, I want to do something. I don't know what that's like. What's electrum? Help me! What do you roll on that? Plus anything? Dren, show them how we do! MVP! I race over to Devan. Are you all right? I will kill her. What is it, insight or wisdom? I don't even have a thing for that. Five. Well, you're the only one that knows where the shit in this house is, so I was telling the truth. Are you okay? Nice, good to know. What's in the chest? The one right in front of you, what's that currency? Like more than platinum? Glad you're all right, do us a favor remember that thing we said about gambling with our lives? Oh, I wouldn't tempt her-- Dren, I promise we will fill our pockets on the way out because this will certainly be the way that we leave, fair enough? We don't want to have a little jingle-jangle-- Other than the-- shit, sorry. Other than the chests in the room, are there any bookcases, or other paperwork like there was in the other room? Would you like to check? No. How about we each get one of those nice, pretty stones, and then we don't reach in any more booty until we leave? How about that? Sure. Let's search the chests. Check them for traps before you open them. 22. Obby? Do me a favor. Will you cut some holes in all of her pockets, please? I did. I move to the door. We're checking it for traps and seeing if it's locked. So if you have been to the basement, then you're obviously familiar with this room. This is the basement? Wait a minute. Those bookshelves-- Delweth, will you pull those away from the wall? The floor is stone? Wood? Does this door lead upstairs? The wine cellar? 23. Yes, Dren. You didn't see any up there? Right. You read my mind, we're certainly not going to find anything in here. What is the floor made of in the room that she looked at? Yeah, I'll go to the doorway. Yeah. Yeah. Can I see any animal hair, or any saliva dried on the floor, any claw marks? 14. What about the ceiling? Can I see the ceiling at all? How high is it? No light fixtures, no chandeliers? I step into the room. Are there any windows or doors in this room? Obby, will you come up here? How do you feel about dogs? No. Can you do me a favor and inspect those dog beds and see what you can make of that bronze column? That's love, man. No, I'm good, why? That's the color of my perspiration. Yeah, take Delweth with you. We should. Delweth, Dren, Devan, will you come here? Delweth, will you secure the room, and see if there are any small dog doors that would open and surprise us in a very nasty way? Will you check the perimeter of the room? Dren and Devan, shall we make our way to that lovely desk? Your hesitation? No? Yeah, you add two. And there's no balcony, riser, second level, or anything in this room? Obby, help Delweth with the wet bar. Do you want to go knock on it? It's hollow! Devan, to the desk, please. Search it. No keys, no books, no binders? Books or binders? An almanac? I'll take the almanac. Can I check the underside of the desk and the chair for hidden switches? 16. Pick up the book. Common and Orc. The globe is a planet globe, or is it an orb? If I open up the almanac and flip through the pages really fast, are there any markings or things that are circled, or anything that might be a cypher or codex for the letters? No. Want to give it a whack? It doesn't seem like it may have a support function. All right, lead the way, Devan. Please, yes. 19. Be my guest. Obby, check the painting. Did you kill him? I trust your judgment. Do you have a haiku for this, Dren? In which room? This might be a strange question. Why is it called the funroom? Her magic stuff. I wouldn't mind that. Do we want to check out the rooms on the right and the left super fast? I'll move to the door where the guard keeps walking outside and crouch underneath one of the windows. If he comes in, he's dead. And I'll let Delweth go with Devan, and Dren goes with Obby. One can check out the library and one can check out the tea room. Armed? She'll die. Does it look like she's standing sentry and doing a guardsman? Be quick about it. Search, come back, and let's move on. Anything? And you two? I quickly check the window to make sure she still has her back to us. We make our way to the stairs that lead to the second floor. The one on the right. Yeah, we would like to stealth. 17. I got the whiff of some number twos. No interest in your room? Shouldn't we visit it for nostalgia? Let's take a look. Let's see your room. I reach up and take the cloth that's hanging over a large portion of the furniture and I pull it off. We take the last tarp and pull it off. I take a dagger out and shove it in the cushions of the love seat and drag it across, open it up. Those dogs get all over the place and ruin shit all the time. All right, fine. We'll leave this room, now. It's just a hallway and the funroom door? Yeah, up to her place. But on this floor is the funroom. You know what? I don't know if you can control yourself in the funroom, so I'm going to take the rope that I have, and I'm going to bind your hands behind your back before we go into the funroom. Oh, Dren, you said you wanted to tie her hands behind her back for me? That looks a little loose. Tighten it up for me? In this hallway and outside of the doors, are there any of those sigils? Okay. Does the doorknob look different than a normal doorknob? The levers? No, I got it. I'll open the door. And I push it open. We don't know what the fuck is happening. Do you remember? I think so too. Just bring her hand with us. (laughter) I can't imagine why. Maybe we need her blood. Dren, cut her. Where were the shields? Were they at the bottom of the hallway from where we are? That we came in? Can I check the floor for traps? 19. Be careful of the rug. It's booby trapped! No, Dren, you stay here. Delweth will go with Devan. I walk up to the little part of the carpet that has the little bit sticking out from under the carpet. Yes, before they go. Like, scrawl? I was going to ask. Oh, it's not? Orcish? Oh, me? No problem. That's a motherfucking one. (laughter) Cool. What if you do an arcana check? If we cross this threshold or if we step here? Are there? Were there windows that were along the wall? Is the dead woman behind a case or is she out, the dead woman? Well you don't have to. You are hard as nails, Obby the Rat. I'm third, Dren's fourth. I am. And Obby in the rear, like he likes it. 24. Jeez. Fucking turtledoves. Strike! Find her. You did it. Do we see her splashing around in the painting? I come up behind her because she's made this discovery, I try one as well. Wow! You're just destined to die! That's two in a row! I go with her. Fucking fun room. Seven. Leading from the front. Haven't hit shit yet. Not one thing. That's the cube. I take the scimitar and try and hit the non-moving, non-armed fish tank. Okay. It's an eight. Yay! Seven. Take a big breath in. Everybody? It's a cube, right? No. I turn towards the glass tank and I hit it with the scimitar. She's lying on the ground, right? The water's hitting her? I walk over to her. I stand right over her. I thought you'd been here before? You didn't know that was going to happen? Yeah. Does nobody notice this? Now you're getting the idea, Dren. You're not doing them. What's there? The room? Oh, she doesn't need to do that. I walk up and I cut her upper arm and get a bunch of blood on my hand. And I walk over to the "siggle" and place it on the-- Well now you're making-- I'm confused. Try. I walk up with one of the daggers and I hold it right under her chin and I say try harder. I push in a little. Try harder. Dren, shut up. Try harder. I don't understand why you're still talking. No furniture or anything in the room? What is the floor made of? Well, we found your room. What happens in here? I don't see a gem. I'd like to insight check her. Does she know? 18. He's at the circle in the middle. I'm halfway from Obby to the door. You know that she is holding onto the ropes. Five? 16. (laughs) I need more tension! (music intensifies) Aw shit. I see we have three daggers. Does that mean we can do like the famous rogue, Vax, and dagger dagger dagger? I take my scimitar with its one trusty hit today. And I swing at White Fang there. Natural 20. Hey, finally! Which means I also get the savage attack crit. That's just savage. That's a three plus three is six. Which means I get an extra damage die, which is a four, for a whopping ten. I do? 2d6. So 18. 18. Nice! This guy. Hide behind Devan? She disengaged, though, right? Yes! (singing) Living on a prayer! Can I turn to the little doggie that is engaged with Obby? And go a little scimitar on his punk ass. Clang-a-lang-lang-lang-lang. Don't worry, it's all part of the plan. I would like to disengage and move to where Dren is. Yeah, behind Dren. Yep. 5d8? Big ass slumber party. Roll another one, right? Roll another six. Each time. Nope. Towards Devan! With my 30 speed, can I go to the last D-O-G? And I will take my whip! (whipping sound) (laughter) Each one of those has been with a different dice. Nice job, Dren. What is he? Is he stupid? Charmed? I'm so frustrated with how this night is going. I'm questioning my own leadership. And I follow my friend Obby's lead and I throw a dagger at the mini beholder. I go closer if I have to. I'll even go right up against the wall, so I can look in the direction of other people. It's a ten! I am impotent! I know what that's like. Obby, get this thing off of me! Is Obby released, now that the beholder's dead, from the whatever happened to him? Get me out from under this thing! I killed it and it fell on me. He doesn't need to know, come on. Thank you. Devan, you fought bravely. Get the doors open, now. We all rush over to take a look. I pick up my scimitar that got thrown across-- Can we come up behind Devan? I thought there was only one of these jewels. What are these other trinkets? I reach out and grab the green book. What happens? All right. I'm pretty sure I can. I open it up. What is it? Oh, shit. I take a step out. Everybody try grabbing one item. After I stepped out-- As she's reaching for the pipes made from children's bones, I look at Obby, and I say, I got what I came for. I walk up behind Devan, I take a dagger, and I reach around and slice her throat. 11. Goddamn you piece of shit! (laughter) Seven. How many of her are there? I look to Obby and say Devan doesn't need to live; this ledger is all that matters. Let's go for the two running towards the doors. Yeah. Are two of them heading towards the opposite door or are they standing right where she was? Yeah, I'll take the one that's just behind the one that's ahead of the other. 18. Wait, it's a four for a dagger. Five. I thought she has to roll a d20? Tarvis has an intelligence of 18, he would probably think the two that were trying to leave the room were-- 15. Oh, the doors are sealed closed. I do, I tucked it away. It's not in my hands, I tucked away. She's in love with Devan. Yeah, you don't, none of us do. How would she know?! Don't help her. All three of us are blind? Are you going to be a fucking Lannister or you going to be a Gryffindor right now? I have two daggers left, so I'm going to take a second one and chuck it in the direction that I think Devan was in. It's at disadvantage, right? Yeah, the butt thumping. 12. Are they up? Seven on the mirror image. Are you dead yet? You will be soon, you conniving bitch! Wait! And my bonus action. I will take my superior healing potion. I need an eight. You guys go ahead, sorry. Superior is 8d8, right? 8d8 plus six? Ours say 8d8. Okay. Son of a bitch. The emerald. You can tear up the ledger. You know that if you leave here, no matter where you go, we will find you, and we will kill you. That's coming out of a dead woman as well. If you smash that emerald, you will not walk out of here alive. I think we just kill them now. Yep. Kill them. Now. 19. I had 18. I look down at this tiny little Benedict Arnold, and I take my scimitar and swing it. What the f--!? (laughter) And a whip. Go get it. Plus what? The ledger? "I'll allow it." She's going to get you killed. As hot as my rage. Again, I try to hit something with a pulse. With the whip! That'll hit, 19. Thank you, Jesus. A one plus two for a whopping fucking three. As a bonus action, I will take a greater healing potion. Continue. (strained) You can sneak attack on Dren because I'm engaged with her. What are the motherfuck-- I don't know what-- We're like a bunch of drunks trying to kill each other with foam noodles. I run up to Devan, and I look at Dren, and I say, this is your last chance. If you don't give her up, I'm going to paralyze her and torture her in front of you for a week. And then maybe I'll let her die. I attack Devan. Yes, you! 17! And I get sneak attack on it. Hey, it's me. Six. Seven. Ten. Think about it. Think about the offer. I'm talking bad torture. Plus, you'll live. Death's a certainty. And sneak attack. Devan. Do it. Devan's unconscious, so it's an automatic two death saving throws. No! (laughter) Think about it, Dren. Life awaits you on the other side of this choice. You can live, drink wine, find someone else. Do death saving throws reset? Do they, Lemur? It's me? Great. I would like to go and strike Devan. You got to wake up. 14. Awesome. 13. Nope. 22. Think about what you're doing. Yeah, go ahead, expose your neck for us while you're doing it. You betrayer. Watch her die. And I take my dagger out, and I kneel down over Devan, and I take the knife, and I stick it in. And then I-- Yeah. She's engaged, right? Just kill her. Who's now engaged. I thought Delweth hit her with a rapier. Oh, that ledger. I'm going to kill Dren. No. 15. Six plus eight and-- yeah. 12. My whip. 16. Would you guys mind if I finished that off? Okay. I take a dagger, and I know she's unconscious. And I turn her head towards Devan and sink it in the neck. Betrayal's a bitch. I'm dead, you guys, I really needed that ledger. Is it in shreds? Is it tapeable? I mean, did she office mash that shit, or is it-- Okay, good. I put them in a satchel. Are those sconces around the room? Four sconces? They're just orbs. Can we go back into the room? Yeah, I'll go in there, because I'm probably dead anyway. Can I pick up the baby finger pipes? Can I try and play some music on that shit? They're not there? Oh, then I go and Dren-- oh, she doesn't have them. Oh, look, they're on Devan's stupid dead body. Can I try and play some music? What else is in that room? I'm in there, and I rolled a 14 plus five. 19. Hey, there's three of us. Let's all grab one. How about I do the one that's furthest into the room? Just the one that's closest to the back of the wall first. I have my left hand on the one that's furthest in the room. Right hand on the middle one. But we're only doing one at a time. Yeah. The deepest one in the room. Crank. Who rolls that? Are they unconscious or dead? I only have one healing potion. Okay. I run out and go, oh, jeez-- wait a minute. Is the floor still electrified? I put the lever back up. I run out, I pour one greater healing potion into Obby's mouth. He wakes up and I go, hi, I need a healing potion. I run over and pour it into Delweth's mouth. That didn't work so awesome. How about I'll stand out here now, and one of you go in there and pull the second one in case-- I had to steal the ledger, which was the real objective, and Devan knew too much to be left alive. She had to die. "I'm secretly in love with you!" You are not the father! You could've lived, man. Thank you to Loot Crate! (cheering)
