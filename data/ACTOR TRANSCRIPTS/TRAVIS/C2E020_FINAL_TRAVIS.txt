Congrats man, congrats buddy. Hashtag booked it! Road trip. Roll a stealth check. The Cube 2.0! Boxy! (hums the intro to "Foxy Lady") What? You never fucking get cold or nothing? Yeah, please. Anybody got whiskey or something? Nott! You got any booze? Would you mind if I swig? Thanks. It's always full. It's really good, it spreads through your chest like a fire. Which is? Oh good. I didn't know if it had a name. Good and drunk. I think so, too. Should you puke it up? Nott, just put your finger down your throat. Face pointing up, though, so it projectile Bouncing Betty vomits everywhere? Is it steaming in the early morning cold? A little salsa? That's a violent reaction. I think we're good for that. We're not concerned at all about that-- what do you call it when you get ambushed? MARISHA, LIAM, and Last night. Yep. It's early in the morning, I'm not awake yet. I'm just checking. Didn't know if anybody was alarmed. Fair enough. That's actually a very good point. Carefully then? Is Caleb blushing at all? All right, saddle up them dogies. (laughter) Medium. A five. Still rolling grasslands, or are there trees off to the side? Vehicles in water. I'm pretty sure I saw carpenter's tools and I was like, who needs that? I think we're going to need to double up on these horses, you guys. Or at least unhitch them from the wagon. In our direction? I'll use Disguise Self and I'll turn myself into a crownsguard. I'm escorting you to the Labenda Swamp. Right? To retrieve stuff for the crown? For Zadash? You should move the safe. Yeah, Yasha and Jester should take the safe. Labenda. Like Zsasz from the Batman comics? Fuck you, horse. Bunch of little things. Can we ask you-- are you familiar with the Labenda Swamp? Seems the same as what he just said, we're not quite sure what to expect. Any tales or stories you can share? (high-pitched pigeon voice) Stop smiling! Anything else but that! Thanks, captain. That's very handy, Jester. Let's see if we can find a rise on one of these hills to camp on the top. No, very peaceful, actually. No. Yeah, I could see how that would appear that way. More that. It hasn't happened that frequently. Yeah, but not yet. If it does, I'll let you know. It's only happened a couple of times, honestly. Well, yeah, just the once, actually. I don't abide by the rules. I walk my own path. Like a twister, I was born to walk alone. Fuck the rules. Give me saline or give me death. Let's set it up. I'll take first. We're at the top of a rise, so we can see really well. I don't mind rain. I have an idea, let's carve the bellies out of the horses, and we climb inside. Yeah. We're going to get wet. Even then, the ground's going to get-- I think the storm's going to wake you up soon enough. These are not explosions, orange or red? Hmm. I think we just need to hunker down. I'm staying up. I like the rain. Not a little one. Don't gamble on those. Which was Molly and I, next one is Caleb and Jester. Did she go back to New York?! Okay, good. Is it water or blood that we're covered in? Third watch is going to be either Yasha and Nott, or Yasha and Beau. How'd the rest of the night go? Any lightning strikes or anything crazy? There was? Did you see it? That's so rare! That's ama-- I mean, right? Lightning strike? I'm going to run over and look at the tree. Yeah. Can I take some little twigs and pieces of wood and put it in my little component pouch? That's what I've heard. I've only seen it hitting the water and it's just (explosion). Yeah? Destroy the cart? Fuck. Yeah. Yeah, I've never heard of anything like that. If you can, Caleb, that would be quite remarkable. Well listen, nothing gets the blood warmed like movement, so perhaps we should pick up and get going. Wooden wheel cart. You're making cocktails? That fucking movie traumatized me. We're going to see a safe house that the lights have been out at. Okay, that's what we decided to do? Nope. Now that we've continued on, how do the wagon wheels look on the road as we're moving? Are they leaving tracks that's filling in with water behind us at this point? Not like the staff push, though. No movement that we can see, just the sound? Branch canopies over us at this point? Yeah, here, look up. Yeah, you got like a tree booger in it. Oh, god, this is the worst part. Can I try and get the boog out of her eye? Natural 20. I got it, Jester. I got it, (vomiting). What did you see? Yeah, we should stop. What'd you see? I'm going to use Minor Illusion, and about 30 feet away above the water, just above the surface of it, I'm going to create a little hummingbird and have it whip back and forth above the water. Just to see what-- Move it a little. Make it disappear. I think we're okay. Maybe not calling out. Where? Which direction? Fuck. I'll run off after her. You're going to hard tax your horse? Yay, map time! (beatboxing) Damn. Oh, fuck! North is that direction? You assume there's only one of them. Jester, Yasha, Caleb, Nott. Six! LIAM and Yep. Shooter, coming out! Fucking linebacker 40-yard dash. The dice can hear you. He's so pissed. I love it. Now we're in this for a dying bird? Are we staying in this? All right. Fine. I'll use my speed to approach 15 feet. Half of 30. I'll use Eldritch Blast at 120 feet for the gator. The farthest north. Two beams. That's a fat one plus four. That's five points of damage. And the second beam 12 points of damage. I did not. I have never played this game before, apparently. Thank you guys for your patience. That is a nine. And that's a 12. I'll use my bonus action to cast-- Nope, that's it. That's my turn. But look. I mean, two big-ass, right at the dinner table, we're real far away. Going to take a hot minute for us to get there. The bell's been rung. Enthrall. What if it's not successful attacks? Total armpit throw. 3d10 plus five? Nott's all caught up. I say Crap. Fire. And two more bursts of Eldritch Blast to the gator holding Nott. That'll hit. That's 23. And the second one. That'll hit, too. That's a natural 17. Okay, great. 12 points of damage on the first one, and six points of damage on the second one, so 18 total. I'll use my pathetic speed to try and match Caleb. Yeah, this is so much fun. I'm glad we are helping this random-ass penguin. Because that's how the cookie crumbles. Please Schwarzenegger it with, "You're luggage." Natural 20 on that. Roll it and be proud. Ooh! No, no, no. Shame on you DM. No more. Regular roll. He's looking at the Great Wall. He rarely references the Great Wall. I fucking see Nott fucking ragdolling all over the place. I'll use the rest of my speed to get as close as I can. Does that put me within 30 feet of that croc? I'm 35 feet away? Oh, fuck me. I just wanted to a little Witch Bolt. Two more Eldritch Blasts going at it. That is a 16 to hit. Oh great, I thought it missed. That's not going to do it, that's 13. That's ten plus four for 14 points of damage. I'll look at that nice piece of luggage and I'll say Nott today. (groaning) Look, look, I'm up to my fucking knees in this quagmire, all right? It's a slop dolly of epic proportions! Fucking Kentucky knows what I'm talking about. We're in it! You can't burp and then try to blame the smell on somebody else. I'll keep an eye out. Let's do two separate rolls. 14. Kiri, have you happened to see a safe house, or a building or a structure around while you were fleeing? The way we came from? We could always give her a horse-- Fearsome. I reach behind my belt and pull out a dagger and twirl it in my fingers, and hand it hilt towards Kiri. Careful, it's sharp. It's okay, Kiri. What good will it do? I don't think that we need to tell her. Fair chance is better than none. We should get back to the cart and at least try to make our way into some drier-- All right, to the cart, then. She's the best of us. Yeah, Molly and I take the lead on the horses. Keystone Pub, right? From what we can see in the streets, is anyone carrying any weapons, or guards, or spears? Keep pushing in, looking for any signage of the Keystone Pub. 15. When you're good and ready. Let him know. Two teeth, busted eye. Boulder-parchment-shears! Did you own the previous bar that this one's built on top of? You know, we love traveling around. Is there anything in Berleben that we just have to see before we leave? Here? Great. Worse ways to go. I walk away from the bar and stand near the door entrance. Yes. True. He did not have the kindest things to say about you. I'll give you 20. Yeah. He ain't going to fucking be here in the morning. Who's taking Kiri? Okay. Molly and Fjord. Got some nuts on you there. Smart. Is there any moisture in the corners of the room? Which one is ours? I really don't mind, This is actually pretty familiar. Not a problem. She writes at like font 55. Yeah, and each page has like 15 words in it.
