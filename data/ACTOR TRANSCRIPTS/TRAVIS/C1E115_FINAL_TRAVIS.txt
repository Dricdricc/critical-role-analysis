I don't know what you're talking about. Also to point out, you did the full mo-cap for it. Not just the VO. And to cure any freakout, Ashley is going to join us. She's finishing up. Can I open it? What the fuck is this? (gasps) Oh my god! Hug me through my wife! That's so great! I can't get hit in the dick with this on! This is amazing! It really covers the whole kit and kaboodle! He picked his cup up without drinking it again! Picks it up. (thunk) I had the immovable rod pulled out, and I click it where I am. It's in my bag. I can throw it to you. Can I pull the carpet out of the bag of holding? Do you want to free fall and go after it? I don't think I can be on it with him. Right? I'm still enlarged. Falling? How high am I hanging off of this thing? A perception check? I am a million-- eight. But a good Revivify might help. Can I take out the carpet and start making my enlarged form way down to them? By myself? Oh. Is she? She's got wings. Can I dispel the enlarged? Oh, it's in for ten minutes. I'm just me. (laughter) I'm just hanging out. I grab the earring and I say Will someone please do me a favor? Will you look for Arkhan's hand? Find me that hand. Arkhan's. I literally just said that. Yeah, it would be nice. Ten. (screams) Oh. Not a gloomstalker. Okay, yeah, I sheathe him. (laughter) Hey, Zahra. All the time. Covered in blood. Yep. Need to get it cleaned. I do, unless you just want to hang out with me up here for a bit. How do I do this? Moo. Oh, right. (click) Put it back in the bag of holding. This is great! Oh my god, I would do this every day. Can I drunkenly fly down to everybody else? Can I fly right as I get closer, just for dramatic effect? I come down! Three-point landing. Super hard. Super hard. (high voice) Not great. Oh, not bad, yeah. Yeah. 14. Do they murder someone when you do that, like a horror movie? He got meteored. (laughter) I didn't sign up for this shit. The sphinx, right. Yeah? I will-- I mean, again. Yeah. Under the moon. It's called a moonhammer. Yeah. In the nude. TALIESIN and Right. Yeah. Moon for moon, as above, so below-- And that will unleash-- I'm going to fuck some cows up. I believe you saved ours first by showing up. Thank you. It is. Lady Vex'ahlia. Yes! I forgot you have one. Please misfire. Please blow your hand off. Please. Oh my god. So good. Behind the back. Oh shit. (laughter) Percy's like, "I don't do that shit." (laughter) I need that hand. Not a problem. That's about as good as it gets, because that's even worse. 16. With a minus two. He fucked us. MARISHA, SAM, and Yeah. Feel like I should take this and try and find him. He's got to fucking die. He was so cool and strong and only his physique rivals my own, but I feel like he's got to die. Couldn't. What? Hold on. A what? So he's a paladin of-- Right. Is that a good or a bad? Of good dragons, or bad? Okay. I feel like he had a good insight, but the hand does bad things, right? But he said preserve it. Lead them to my junk? People have come looking for it for less. It doesn't even look like a hand. Just like one really big middle finger. (laughter) Yeah. All right, I have it. I'm not going to preserve it. And Bahamut is the platinum-- No, Bahamut is the good dragon of the platinum variety? Would you say they are at odds? TALIESIN and Like Godzilla and King Kong? She was badass. LIAM and I'll just hold on to the hand right now. Nothing. We just had a big fight. I have to go after the hand, I must kill Vecna, I have to do these things. Nuh-huh. No. That's true. That was part of a trade. No, there was a trade of items. I got a cloak of smashing out of it, and you got... other stuff. No, we didn't. You caught it?! You threw it-- Oh my god! (laughter) (gasps) You're so strong. What'd I miss? Before we go down, before we leave, what about Sylas? They have coffins, right? Just goes up and says hi to people. Yeah, right! Maybe we let him go. That's a good point. We're going to live a life of paranoia, aren't we? That would be lovely. I pick up Pike and put her on my shoulders. Get on the dragon. Yeah. Decorum. We're pretty sure he's alive and well. You know, he's a threat right now. (whispering) What, do we have proof? There was a process. We had trammels. Yes. Ask for money? Can I ask, are you afraid? Was that necessary? Makes sense. A celestial hand reaches out of the clouds. Pike. While we're here, I feel like if Bahamut is the natural enemy of Tiamat, I don't know if I want to be bound to this sword for much longer. I feel like my time of hunting Vecna is done. I feel like we have Arkhan's hand. Maybe if we handed it over to the Platinum-- these people? Then somebody else could take up that hunt, right? Yeah. Okay. I think I want to turn over this sword, but would you stay with me? He's very persuasive. Actually, Scanlan, will you come with me also? All right. Can I make my way back towards somebody official-looking? Highbearer Orb sounds good. Anyone ever? Stronger than anyone that's ever wielded you? Yeah? (sighs) You make a really good point. We're really strong together and unstoppable. I mean, hold on, Pike. Maybe we could do a lot of good. We could really rid the world of a lot of bad stuff. (exhales) Okay. (strained) Highbearer Orb, a moment, please. I would like to make a deposit. I have on my person the Sword-- Okay. 14. (sighs) I'm so sorry to waste your time. I wanted to thank you for hosting us. Bidet. And I start to turn and walk out. It's a bad idea. (strained) Together we could do so much, we could dry eraser-board the planet. I want to keep it. (strained) I want to keep it! I start walking out of the Sanctuary. 19. (strained) I want to help the planet. 15. (strained) Just the two of us. We can make it if we try! Just the two of us, Kas and I. Can I try and fight it? 11. Maybe I'll take mine-- is it a wisdom saving throw? That's a five. Okay. I stop. (deep breath) It is the Sword of Kas. I'm feeling so achy. What happened? Whew! Yeah. We kept the sword, right? Oh. Okay. Yes. That blade, careful with it, very powerful. He is bent on the destruction of one thing and one thing only. Vecna. Wait! I have something else. Then I show the hand of Arkhan. Oh! The person that owned this hand-- okay, stay with me. Chopped this off and took Vecna's hand and stuck it on and then this got left over. So this is not his hand anymore and the one that he does have is Vecna's. So if you use your noodle, you can use this to trace him. Yeah, right? It was pretty smart. Arkin. Arkeen? Arkhan. Arkhan the Fool. The Cruel. The-- Don't underestimate him. He's really buff and devious. Cool. Yeah, he was pretty cool. He was pretty cool. Well see, don't hurt him. He actually helped us defeat Vecna. He pulled a tricksy-doodle and took the hand. Sure. Yep. Beep beep. All right, Pike, shall we away? Scanlan, shall we away? Away we-- oui oui? ASHLEY and I feel good. I feel like pursuing Vecna was something that we all did together and I feel like whatever we do now is new and I felt like I was going to have to do that on my own and I don't want to do that. That's good to know. You handing out apologies? I will consider accepting your apology if you tell me whatever happened to it. Okay, Allura. (laughter) Pike! Go upside down! (wookiee growl) (mediocre wookiee growl) I would like to bid on it, as well. Yeah, I have some money still-- Yeah. She's in some pretty solid hands. Yeah! Can I also start pulling out the remaining eight expensive-ass bottles of wine from the bag of holding? Expensive-ass! Expensive-ass bottles of wine. Yeah. Desperate times and all that. The most frustrating. What does come next? We left it as an outpost. I wouldn't mind going back to Whitestone for a bit. (hesitant noises) I'll think about it. It seems like that has responsibilities. I do. There is an updated tour. If you can bear it. I pull her into the biggest hug. You almost called me your own name. It's okay. You'll be fine. I don't. You gave us the option. You said believe it or fucking not. I call nope. Thank you, Pike. Are we throwing caution to the wind? I do have something that might up the party a little bit. I reach into the bag of holding and I pull out a little leather pouch. What? So I've got this little deck of cards and every time someone pulls from it, great shit happens. One. Two. Scanlan? He's the Lord of the Quadroads now. You'll partake. Three. Percy? Why? This place is already fucked up. Let's get it on. Keyleth? Why are you so resistant to gifts and wonder? Magic? Don't be jelly. Pretty much. What? Here or Whitestone? All right. Pike, you want one? (laughter) Well, jeez, I thought we were all having tequila shots and going crazy and taking pictures and writing our name on the bathroom walls, but it seems like everybody's lost their nerve. I put it back in the bag of holding. (laughter and groaning) The night's still young. (laughing) She doesn't handle that booze very well. Has everybody gone off? I make my way sneakily outside. Oh, really? Oh, you know, I was just gonna, um. Shit in them. I wander outside, where I'm by myself. Do I see anyone? Like it matters. Oh! 17. I pull a card. Yeah. It's nighttime. I rolled a bunch of hit dice from our short rest. I might have. I'm pretty sure-- I'll tell you. My soul is drawn from my body. My body is incapacitated. It is placed within an object that the DM chooses. A Wish spell will tell you the location of the object, but will not reverse the action. My body's still there. I'm there catatonic with an open deck of cards in my hand like this. Somebody's going to find me. What are the halls of Pandemonium? I'm keeping you occupied. I really did this for you. We'll one-shot it later. (laughter) Oh! It got me a chair. What? Did what? Do I lose any hit points? What? What happened? Wait! I fucked up. I'm sorry. No. (laughter) Are you sure? All right. Sorry, guys. Sorry, Pike. (tearfully) And Percy lost his arm! So news flash, pro tip the cards may be dangerous. Everything. Sorry. To be fair, nothing really happened in that mind. It's okay. "In the Anus of Dragons," accurately. How old are you, exactly? This whole time? Yeah! You guys keep it quiet up there, please? You can ask me. You're a scoundrel. Do you have any money? That's worth literally nothing. How about you give her this? And I take out the rare black sapphire and put it in your hand. I'm fucking watching you, you understand? Don't you slip up! I know. I usually put dead people in the bag of holding, but there's always a first! Treat her right. (high-pitched) Yes. Ranger's hat. Only you can prevent forest fires. I'm so fascinated by Vasselheim. I have so many interests that I feel it only proper to go back and turn myself in to the authorities for punching one of the guards in the face and take whatever punishment they have for me. Yeah, up top, that's where we were. Oh, I'm free to go? That's unexpected. Could you point me in the direction of a library? Yes. You. You will come with me. Gentlemen, whose word are you going to take? The savior of Vasselheim, or his new tutor? Well, unless you have something better to do, you could contribute to one of the greatest people to ever pass through this city and help me learn to read a little bit more. Would that be a problem? I only have 8,000 gold to give you. Natural 20. (cheering) Yes, 8,000 gold. I could carry it if you want. Fair enough. I'd like to learn to read a bit more. I'd like to split some time in the temple of Kord. Oh, he did survive. I'd also like to bring Pike out every once in a while and we give challengers a shot in the Crucible, but mostly I'm trying to improve my mind and looking for the next challenge. Seven's a good start. (laughter) Yeah. Let's do it again. (laughter)
