Yeah, man. It got Foster in front. Stay Turnt. We've been reading it out loud. Pretending to be those characters. A.W.A. next weekend. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in Hotlanta. Come see us. We've got panels. We got autograph sessions. We got chances to take pictures, and eat food, and we're going to run through the quad streaking. Tequila. Yeah, so that stuff. Cry? Hold each other. I think it was the other side of your face last week. I liked the new way. This is old "I know this" face. Just a little bit. Okay. (laughter) I think it's a chunnel, actually. Yep. Small difference. I guess I'm all right. Look, I know we haven't said it much, but Pike, I am glad you are here. I just felt like saying that. Yeah, no problem. Love you, Pike! Yes. Sneaky fucks in front. Pike and I got the rear. But we are being sneaky. Vast space? Big, wide open? Could be a Rick and Morty portal to the Shadowfell. That's further than I thought. They are a couple hundred feet away. Hey, twins? How do our flanks look if we move forward? Is it just trees? Is it buildings? (laughing) Super slow. (laughter) Yeah, but we're in here. It's a tiny ball. Make a ball-handling check. Same option as ten minutes ago. What is that? Yeah. (gasping) They're right here! (laughter) Look through the scoop. Look through it. What do you see? Pike's so brave. So brave. Death knight. I didn't even think about that. He doesn't know who it's from. He probably detected it, but he doesn't know who. Or where. Said the barbarian about the god. Couldn't Scanlan look like one of the mages we killed and walk up and be like, "All "clear, everybody. Go home. It's all done." He had a name? Yeah, you could walk it up real close and be like-- The people who are guarding the archways. We trap them with explosives and shit. Always the tone of surmise. Yeah, we heard rumblings down there. Oh, this actually sounds like a plan, which means it will go terribly. Look, Odell went to Vecna because his wife left him because she's like, "Oh, you're not very "powerful." And he's like, "I will find and show you power." So you went to Vecna and you gouged your eye out. But then your depth perception is off now. So then you're like, "I'm going to work "my way up through the ranks." Pike, smack Scanlan. Let him know. Do you want to know his backstory? (laughter) We could hide in a house, one of the ruins. Pike can get on my back. You're the only one who'll be saying jenga, pretty much. 22. But they can both see the middle? Because we don't know what it is? Do we have a way to alienate these three that are walking to go see Odell? Do we, or do we not? But we don't know what it does. You're in a fever dream. Are you talking about collapsing the middle tunnel? Should we entertain the idea of collapsing the tunnel that we sent everybody to? But all the danger, the majority of it, is behind us. Even if you can just get the one. All of them coming back or chasing us is going to be a bitch. Even if it just slows them down. Make a run for it? If they're all in there. 19 times two? Is what? Sure. I wait until everybody's through, and do I see a crack or nice weakened part in the archway that I can smack? Hold onto your butts. 13. I like the maybe. I rear back and hit the fucking shit out of it. Reckless. That's nice. 24. What do I roll? 1d4? Oh, that's a one. Nine. I pick up Pike, and we start running. I have advantage on those. It's okay. 17. 23. I reach over to Scanlan, and I rip his hair off. That is a great hat. I like parties. I don't know how much further we have, but we really need that sword, right? We still have not seen the Sword of Kas? Oh. Good. Oh, because we haven't seen it yet? I think the Death Knight was holding the Sword of Kas. Oh shit, you about to ride the Matrix, girl! You about to plug in! Big black sword. (laughter) You can admit it. It's okay. Come clean. Is that what you call big? Do we really need it? We had the ability to tunnel through earth, but this guy let it go. Unless you wanted to hop in the necklace and give it to her in the elemental form. That's probably what they were looking for. But they were going the wrong way. In your ethereal idea, do you leave your physical body and your stuff? That's not a terrible idea, if your stuff works that way. It's also super loud and moves a lot of stuff, and shit collapses-- All in favor of the ethereal idea, raise your hands. All in favor of the earthglide elemental, raise your hand. Is Gate Stone immediate? You've got to let Vex go. You're talking about going in the open air? Risking the open air to get closer? Leaves a lot of room for a bad roll. So how long can you tunnel? And how long in each tunneling thing? Or tunnel back. Pike and I charge out of the tunnel. Did you say 40 feet? SAM and And we've got three of those, so we're going 120 feet? Two dozen plus things flying around. Pike and I are going to roll some stealth checks. It'll be great. If there's anything around that sword when you get there, you're on your own. (laughs) This is craziness. I think there is an upside to Pike and I not having to roll those stealth checks, even with Pass Without a Trace, but if there's anything around that sword, it's going to be up to you to either fight it and get the sword, or get the fuck out. You want to do that? Corner three. Do it. Even if it accidentally hits it, it's toast. I've got Pike in my hand. I had to roll for both of us. But I had advantage. I think we're okay. That advantage saved that whole thing from going tits-up, because that first roll was (explosion). 24. Wait, don't high-five shit yet! Why are you high-fiving? What the fuck? What's wrong with you people? Jesus! Started? I hold out my hand to Vax and I say Good luck. I hold out my hand to Vex and I say Take care of him. (laughing) Right out of the gate?! Wow, make it worse. That's a one. No, she just breathed. Come on, you got this. Let's go. Just drop it out your hand and watch as-- Is it cocked? It looks cocked. It's a DM call on him, I think. Or how he wants to translate it. That makes sense. I don't know. Keep going. Keep doing it. She's currently in ethereal form drifting down; we should see what happens with that. It's like LSD, isn't it? It'll take eight hours to go away. (laughter) Why is it always green? He's an astronaut without a ship. You could just wait it out. We discussed this. Say it. Oh god. Jesus. Immediate perception check around us. Oh, 17! 17. You all figure out what we're doing next. And I put the bloodaxe away and I start concentrating on this giant greatsword. Well. You always remember your first. Could you be a little bit more specific? (laughter) Are you hearing anything? Aces. (laughter) The witch? Oh, the lich. Yeah. Are you talking about Vecna? Then yes, we do share similar goals. I don't know if you can hear me very well. Your voice is barely there. I'm attuning! I'm locking it in. Hey. Hi. I'm not even trying to hide it this time. Yeah. Anybody else? What? Oh! It was saying that we have similar goals and that the witch must die. The lich is Vecna. Lich. The lich. It's very emphatic about the lich, meaning Vecna, and it's going to die. Apparently, I'm going to be an instrument. He's going to play me to topple the followers and his secrets. That's a good question, Pike! (whispering) What do you require from me in return? He really doesn't ask much. Just average run-of-the-mill fight stuff. Be true to thy friend. This one is nothing to worry about. Oh. Reception problems. Hold on. Yeah, I'm proficient. Yeah, but minus two for my fucking curse. 12. It's great. Guys, I don't feel so great. That's who I was going to attack. I didn't say reckless. Would he make them reckless? 21. 1d8. Not raging. The damage or to hit? It's worse. 18. That's way worse. That's a 16. I'm going to be totally full front here. The sword needs blood. I feel like it's trying to take it from me. You jumped in front of him? 27. Ten. That hits. Oh, that's only a nine. It's actually ten because I had to reroll ones and twos. DÃ©ja vu. Now, listen. This is an ally. You're all right, yeah? You're okay. Is it minus? (deadpan) Ow. (laughter) What?! This is the biggest card ever! Oh shit. Good. Totally good. As with all good things, comes with a bit of risk. Yeah, all the time. Even Pike would say this is worth it. I got the feeling it needs to be fed blood often. Funny thing, that's what Craven Edge used to do, as well. Oh, what do I call you? Vox Machina, meet Kas. Kas, try not to hurt them. He makes no promises. He's very forthcoming. This is really nice compared to the last guy. He said hi. He's like I like your freckles, Keyleth. Okay, can I put you back in your scabbard? Oh yeah. We're going to rock that body real hard. Holy shit. I mean, there's motivated people in the world, and then there's this totally rocking motherfucker. He's of a single purpose. It's incredible. Just wants to fuck him up, Swiss cheese style. And his whole family. It's good that you have me here, Vax. My experience with these sort of weapons. They are fueled by various-- I need a big word-- various fuels, and I feel like he needs blood to be good. Yeah. That was my plan, but we could do it right now. Just to be careful. You want to drip some on the blade and see if he likes the flavor? Guess he digs the other white meat. No, I've asked that before, man. You don't want to go that way. Yeah. It went all anime. Yeah. In fact, any time I take him out of the scabbard, why don't you hang real close. I might have to plunge him into your thigh or something. I don't know how hungry he is. Do I need some eye drops? Yeah, we got this blue crystal. I take out the blue crystal. Is it still pulsing? Oh yeah! Yeah, you want to? And spray it with perfume? It's going to put me a lot closer to doing that. The only weapon that does as much shit as this does, the closest thing to it is your staff. Your Vestige. This thing is bonkers. And we certainly don't expect that to be accomplished without something given in return. Of course. We fought of a bunch of ancient dragons. We've established order back in our realm. Very true. (laughing) Amazing! Oh my god! Vex, be quiet. That seems most unfortunate. I think that's a fair request. It's like a dog, you got to pull him off your calf! We got an eye. We'll keep the rule of law. Vax, I want you to know I've never been more proud of you than I am right now. I might. I'm just saying, you're about to buy the ticket and take the ride of a literal fucking lifetime. You're not here anymore. How do you feel? Are you nervous? Can I put my hand on his chest? Is the heart still beating? Is it beating any faster? Because he's nervous. Still pretty chill. Do you want us to hold anything? Do you want to wear your clothes? All right. What about after you're dead? No touch at all, no pickle? Oh! Oh, okay. Yeah. Right. Yeah, everything in your life has been leading up to this point. This is the pinnacle. This is great! Fair enough. I step up behind Vax in case he has an involuntary reaction to reach up to his arms. Just to keep his arms down. I don't. This is your head, man. Are you hungry right now? (laughter) Oh god. Okay. I'm going to look at Scanlan. Were you expecting this at all? I'm going to grab the armor, if you don't mind. Oh, thank you. Let's go away from the group, into the trees. Hopefully, that won't kill us. And we lay it down. You're not there! I wanted to shave half of his head because he shaved my beard that one time, but there's really nothing left of him right now. That's the thing about dawn. It takes a while out here, doesn't it? Wasn't expecting the ashes part. I expected the crash test dummy. Weekend at Bernie's. I had a whole fucking theme park lined up. (laughter) We don't know. I do have a question. Are you familiar with the werewolves that roam these lands? Right. Are they around this part? That's all. I'm just saying. Just curious. Some sweet action with some stuff maybe you haven't seen before. One-eyed prick named Vecna. That guy knows how to relax. Think so. Yeah, probably nude. Probably put clothes on to be nice around us. What did you say? Briarwood? No. I was eating all the food in the mansion. Didn't you evaporate him with a Sunbeam or something? And then we like killed him in a coffin? Is it a big spell for you? Or? Actually, that last one is pretty dope. Get all your turns, all your everything? Two times whoever you make? Do that one. Fuck the flying thing. Yeah, I know he hovers and flies, but. Can you cast Fly on somebody? No. The option of having a second caster like you is way bigger than making me fly. If they know it's magic. I still like that idea better. Can you cast Haste? If there's two of you and you could cast Haste on me, I'd take that over the flying creature. It's nasty. It doesn't get me off the ground, but at close speed. I'd have a hundred feet of movement. Yeah. Plus an action surge. You've got a decision to make. We've got sleep to get. Oh, and he died in the Material Plane? (gulps) Oh shit. (cheers) For the second time butt-naked ending! Fuck! No, that was-- It was the best thing I could have ever hoped you said. Ashley! Thank you, Marvel Puzzle Quest.
