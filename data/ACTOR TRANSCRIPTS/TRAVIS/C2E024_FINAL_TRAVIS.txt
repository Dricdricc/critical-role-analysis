Dungeons & Dragons! Oh! Hurns doesn't play for them yet. It's a Troy Aikman Snuggie! That is some Planet of the Apes. It's like just the chin strap part. That's really Abe Lincoln of me. Yeah, it is. That's Anthony Kiedis. What a look into the future. And what a bright future at that. (with mouth full of food) I'll put it on at the break. I've got it right here. I'll put it on when we get to the break. I'll put it on. Six hit points. Laughter and music? I don't trust laughter and music. Is this every night or just-- It is. Wow. Work hard, play hard. Should we drop our shit off and-- Quick question. This Blushing Tankard tavern, the doors lock, right? There's privacy, it's not like some fucking free-for-all all night, is it? Upstairs, in the rooms, I assume they have-- I'm just asking. I don't know! Could be free love and a bunch of crazy people roaming around, I don't know! Right? Oh, shit. Yeah. We're in for a fucki-- Okay. Fiber optic whips. I am. Very nice of you. Can I keep an eye on her hands just to make sure she's not going through my pockets while she's up here? 15. I feel a little guilty, but not much. There's some of them now. Am I stopping? We're going to lose a finger before the night's done. Yeah, bitch. Hocus pocus, motherfucker. I slow down just a little bit and give her time. Bring him with us! Please tell me he has a shortsword and can fight. Yes, please, bring Kiri and that guy I'll be happy every fight. As she starts to roll up I go Hyah! And just take off. It incinerates the fiber. Yeah, different fingers, but sure. I like it. Diversions. Say no. Yeah, we're here. Is there a hitching post in the front? Yeah! Hitch up the horses. They seem real jovial-like. You want to go in and secure us some rooms, and I'll watch the carriage. Figure out if there's somewhere else we need to keep it? Oh! Or that. Yeah, while he does the string. We're going to lose her tonight. That dice just is the biggest tease. Caleb and I have come in at this point and I turn to Caleb and go I feel like I may be regretting my roommate choice tonight. It's just a hunch. I think he's in his element. You think? He'll just like tear into the night and maybe not come back until the sun comes up? Yeah, it's like-- I do. I thought those were rabbits. We're going to have to work on our analogies, I feel like there is something missing here. Yeah, okay, a bunny coyote. It does sound cute. Yeah, just in case he goes full monty, I might have like a secret knock or something. Yeah. Fair enough, I appreciate that. Oh. No, I mean half of me's interested, the other half's terrified, so I'm just kind of curious. Yeah. The table, Sam, the table! Wow, that took a turn fast. They called you "Tabletop." Tinkertop. He said he was brain-sick. We're actually here for a spot of work. I said for a spot of work. Didn't she just say not to-- (heavy metal guitar melodies) Did you just take a dancer's tip? That's justice. Hot damn! A bit of Fuse? I know what Molly'll be having in a couple hours. Rissa, can I ask you about the-- what's it called-- honor hour that comes up later? Hour of Honor, yeah. What's that about? There you go. It could cost a lot of money. Well, he said whoever contributes the most monetarily gets to take a shot at the honor. Is it happening relatively soon, or do we have a few more hours to explore a bit? I just have the feeling if we were to engage, that all activities after that would not be documented in the ol' brain so well. I figure, if we're going to do that. All right. To bed! Why not? There's no drop-off daycare. Is there a daycare here, Rissa? Oh, god. Rissa, do you know how much one of these evening companions might run per hour? Should I go ask? Yes, all right, fine. I'll be right back. I'll make my way up to the bar, to the one with the-- I still want to check the price, so I go up to the bar. Thank you kindly, ma'am. It's a little early in the evening, but I thought I might get a head start and inquire what some friendship might run me. I would hate to remove you from your duties. Plus, my companions are also interested in the same. You said there might be-- Oh! No, yeah, let me clarify. (stammering) I need-- Multiples-- not multiples! I need individual companions for my friends, not just your beautiful self. Three. Great, and do you know how much that might run? Per hour is good, yeah. Boy, that sounds like a fun night. Outstanding. I will be sure to return. I turn my head and leave. That was the most horrible thing I've ever had to do. I'm not prepared to talk to people about those things. It's 20 gold for three people for an hour. Nope. At one hour, three people 20 gold. So that's-- yeah. God, it's real uncomfortable. Look, I was just making shit up on the fly, all right? Is that a phrase, or does she actually mean she'll hold the bird down? Jester, come on. She is just trying to tug on your heart strings. She'll be fine. I know. She'll be safe. (singing) He's never going to dance again. Fucking Pet Sematary up in this bitch. You got scarves on you? We're going to need a beagle to lead the charge. I'm assuming that's you? Jesus. (dog baying) Oh! Ma'am. (stammering) No, no. I'd like to put a deposit down. I don't know when we'll be back. Maybe four gold to hold the reservation? No, I can't. I'm terrified. Yeah, okay. I think I did. I feel like I did. Did you just say I'd been with your mom?! Yeah, that's fucked up! I'm not real comfortable with this sort of stuff. Yeah, totally. Yep. I have. Maybe not many, though. No. Yep. Pretty close. No. I'm going to let you guys take the lead on this. I'm more of a spectator, at this point. No, I thought we were going out for an hour! Thought we were going to warm up into this thing! No, we're going out for a bit, right? Oh, jesus. It begins. Can we get you a card, and hold it up? Bookstore. We're arms dealing on fucking party night. Narc. Is Nott slurring her words? Industrious. With cinnamon, right? Oh my god. Are there any authorities walking the street? Any crownsguard or kingsguard or--? Just like sentry, though. They're not concerned or turgid or stiff? Among their folks? Looks like they even go through the night. That's some dedication. Yeah. Work ethic can choke you in that way. Well, it's about that time. Should we make our way back for whatever this is going to be? How many charges does that thing have? Sure. Oh god. Hmm, shit. Price is right. Fraternity all-stars. Anybody who wants in. Probably not, Jester. I can drink. Our fucking team captain over here! Well, we need five. It's fungus, actually. Listen, the anchor needs to be you, Nott. You're our ringer. Molly, do you want to kick us off? Warm it up. Yeah! Molly, how is it? Oh, shit! She's got nothing on you. She's nothing! You got this! Oh no, you're getting shithoused during this round! Burns your eyes a little bit. You got this. Brutal. Win or go home, Beau. Eye on the Cobalt Soul, here we go! I'm sure we've got bread around here somewhere, just find something to soak all of that up. Keep him out of your head! For you. So polite. Caleb, steady. Okay. I'll throw my leg over the chair and sit down. Evening. You ever done this before? No. 16. Is that all there is to this? Fill her up! 13. I admit, I feel a little weak. I can't tell if it's the drink or if it's your beautiful visage sitting in front of me. Shit. Fill her up. Natural 20. Natural 20. Never get into a drinking game with a man of the sea. Nah, we win money. There's money in it. I like it. I say we go for it. Are you putting in the f-- well. The dodecahedron. You know, she's called the Bottomless Pit. (hiccups) The Whale?! You already have this! Otto the Bottomless Pit! Otto! Jester cut him! He can't see you out there, cut him! Nott! Free drinks? (drunkenly) Yep. Tell me you have biscuits and gravy or something. You know, I think I have some more libations in me. I know. The night is young! It's young! It's young, Molly! No, it's fine! Well, that's not true. I'm fine. Wow. Not at all. She doesn't know me like that. It's not real. Where's your pisser? I'll be right back. I go. You're drunk. You're real relaxed. Holy shit! Puke and rally! I actually did not come back down. I might have passed out in the pisser. It's a fucking tease. What's wrong with you? You! That's a lot of money. (screaming) It's that damn bird. Don't stop there. She's a kleptomaniac. I can tell! I thought you said you had something. Can we bring the volume level down? Yeah, that's a good idea. Let's go down and talk to Irena. I don't think it was her. She's been nice. I'm thankful for your seedy background right now, Molly. The fucking kids had, like, six coins on them. Happens all the time. It's out front. It was tied to the hitching post. Excuse me! Can I have a mi-- (hiccups) minute of your time? The crownsguard. Yeah, I'm walking out. Morning. You go first, yeah. (breathing deeply) We tied one on last night, in a harsh way. Indeed. So much so that we seem to have been relieved of our coin during last night's revelry. Yeah. Does that happen a lot around here? Well that might not be necessary. I believe it was our fault. But just out of curiosity, is there anywhere in town that, I don't know, there might be an infestation of this sort of problem? Do you know any common areas where folks engaged in this sort of activity might gather at night or in the day? Areas of trouble that you've dealt with before-- oh god, am I sweating? (sighs) We're a little light on details, unfortunately. You know what, I'm going to go eat a half a cow, and then maybe once that's soaked up some of this I'll return. If I remember anything else. All right, thank you, have a good morning. I like it. Cut to the fucking chase! Trim the fat! (cooing) More specific! Fitz and Ashton. You didn't need to remind her, she's ready to pop as it is, all right? Rissa, do you know where this Ashton and Fitz stay? Why don't we start by going around where Fitz and Ashton lived and then maybe we can pay a little visit to Rissa's pops? When we get there after our run, I chuck up a little salsa into the back of my throat and swallow it down. Morning. We're The Mighty Nein. We had the pleasure of meeting your daughter yesterday. She showed us a great time last night. A repeating crossbow. That's not true, it actually is quite impressive. You said you'd lost some favor with people in power. I don't mean to pry, but would you mind sharing what happened? Come on. Shamone! Oh, yeah, that's a 20. Are there punishments levied against you? Yeah, we're kind of death-adverse. Fuck, we're broke. Are you afraid this clockwork warden could be used for malign purposes? It's tit for tat. In this case, we're short on coin, and you make mighty fine objects. Seems to have caught the eye of most of our group. We will take it under consideration. Cleff, do you also have simple arms? Probably heading that way anyway. The anvil. You raised her good. She's been taking good care of us. Awkward. I believe she's incorporated. She's incorporated. Cleff, we appreciate your time. We are going to venture out. Our compliments on your work. It is truly spectacular. There it is. So Lasagna, should we try and find our way over to the-- Wait a minute. Indeed. I'm sure their employers are not fond of thieves in their midst. Ooh, it's on! Yeah, Fitz did seem like a prick, didn't he? Fitz, I understand that you might have felt a little slighted by last night's encounter. I didn't say you could talk. What I want to know is, when you came back into the bar last night, did you see fit to rummage your way through some good, hard-working people's coin purses? How about your friend Ashton over there? See, now we're in a dangerous territory, because once that staff comes out, she's got to hit something with it, and it's not going to be me. Listen, Fitz. The best thing you can do here is wrack your brain real hard, and think have you ever seen anyone around that establishment that might take advantage of some people enjoying some good imbibements? Oh, Fitz. Tick tock, tick tock. Oh no. I know, it's mine. 16. We're making kids cry. This is amazing. You don't know anyone else that has made a habit of doing this regularly, then? You might get it ready, Nott. I feel like we're not getting anywhere here. Fitz, I'm going to talk to my colleague here. If you move, Beau is going to take your head off. Don't. Move. (whispering) Okay, we got them right where we want them. Just fucking act like you don't like what I'm saying. Look agitated. Look more agitated, right now. More grimace. Give me nostrils. Nasolabial fold. Really work it. There it goes. (louder) All right. I talked to her, Fitz. Listen, she will stay her staff if, in the next 24 hours, you work your ass off and you find out who took our money. Easy, Beau. Remember what you said! This is not going to go well for you unless you can produce some results. Well, if you got to work, you got even less time. Better be motivated. Excellent. Yeah, might scare them straight. It's our pleasure. We take our leave. Yeah, when we were in there, the shields and swords, they looked fairly standard, or were there some that were like "holy shit!"? Yeah. Rissa, how far are we from this Assembly Yard? And just out of curiosity, the Silver Falls, the residential area, how far is that? Ol' Blemmy's over in the Silver Falls, that residential area. Do we want to go there, or-- (softly) Oh, shit. Yep. But we have no leads on the girl, correct? No one saw her, knows her name-- You did. Do you bite your silver pieces before you put them in your coin purse? Like, little tiny dicks? Silver Falls. If there was a way to ask about-- If you could ask about large purchases, that would be a good idea. Silver Falls? Keeping an eye out for old, craggly sailor-types. Me? Yep. Eight. Throwing up while we do it. Yep. That motherfucker had leather apron with shitty-ass sleeves. Let's turn it down. No. Who's going to guard the back? Fuck yeah! If she's getting a beacon. Oh no. No, Kiri, this is where we're stealthy, all right? Knife goes away. Shh. Nice. Two story? One story? She hops up there, I run around the back. Is there a door or a window on the back at all, or is it just like--? Outstanding. (whispers) Okay. Awesome! Front door, back door. Easy. Easy. Easy. We're not going to hurt you. No, Nott! It's fine. You're not in any danger. Nott Detective Agency always gets their man! It's all right. No, Beau, we're already winning. How old are you? You said you haven't had your parents around for a while now? What happened to them? Doing what? Here? In Hupperdook? The Changebringer? Tithe collectors? You all brothers and sisters? And your parents' names? Gail, you been taking care of your younger siblings this whole time? You been holed up here, or you on the move? How long before the tithe man comes back? Gilda and Wallace. Let me ask you, if we were to somehow get your parents out of the Gearhold prison, would you stay here? I'm the one asking questions here. You don't seem to be taking my meaning. If we were to reunite you with your folks, would you get out of town right quick? Give us a moment, will you? The Partridge Family. Keyleth! No, but seriously. Listen, they've obviously done a fair job of taking care of themselves. We could toss them some coin and wish them well. Or, if we're serious about returning Cleff with his (tongue click), might as well see if we can get a little extra friend or two out. No promises, but man, if we have an opportunity to reunite these kids with their parents, that's a pretty special deed, don't you think? Man, I entirely forgot. I think it's, "Do I believe him?" right? They said the tithe man could return any day. What if we come back and they're gone? You'd eat a child. I knew I saw you drooling! I would really like the opportunity to leave this place better than we found it, especially for these kids. I understand. If it goes sideways, it goes sideways, and we run. But if we can keep them out of an orphanage, I would be most grateful to all of you. Yes. I was. They're terrible fucking places. Agreed. The effort is all I ask for. We're a clever group. Surely we can survey, come up with a plan, try something. If we fail, we fail, and we'll move on with our objective. I can't leave here without trying. How about we bring the kids back in, we give them a little coin so they stay out of trouble, for the next-- We tell them to stay put, unless they're getting food. With the girl we found, right? Or we could drop Kiri off with the little girl that-- You take care of each other. You're a little temporary family for now. Remember, stay quiet. Could have just gone back and bought it, but no, we want to go the expert level!
