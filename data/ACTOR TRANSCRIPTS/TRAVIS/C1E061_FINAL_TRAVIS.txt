Whoa! It is sexy! That's going to be some insane audience. They'll mail you one? Can we please? I'll give you some of my beef and broccoli. It is an announcement. We're seeing Hamilton on Saturday. Javier Mu≈Ñoz and I are going to be best friends, and then I'm going to go to dinner with George Washington. I'm going to shave his head. It's going to be awesome. It's there! You guys are still by yourselves, right? You two? Nobody else is concerned about the commotion that happened behind the trees, and we're all just like "Hi." What happened? What's in the cave? Are you sure you haven't been eating mushrooms or something? That's exactly what I was thinking. How far in did you go? Did you know he was going to be here at this cave? Somebody insight check that little bastard. I would do it, but eh. Boring. Scanlan, you want to go in? Oh my god, we're in the Feywild, we're about to pull a bow out of a tree, and you don't want to see what's in the creepy cave. I know, I'm looking at the scandalous one over there that's always trying to get little goodies for himself. All right, you went (boop). I'm just saying. All right, fine. I'm happy. What if we run, touch the back of the cave, run back. We don't even have to pick up anything. Just to say we did it. What, all the bad shit already came out of it, what do you say? I know, he's got the raised eyebrows. I'm not sure if we should do it or not. What, ten or higher we go? Natural 20. I put Scanlan on my back, and we run straight into the cave. I don't want any torch. I've got darkvision! Jackpot. We are the greatest ones in the group. Are the candles standing up or are they laying over? We have not said anything to the rest of the group. Can I do one, as well? Yeah, there's nothing that moves in here. In that circular area, is there anything on the back wall? More candle sconces? And the skull is big, like the size of my chest? Does it look like it could have been a bear skull? Well. No, but look at it! We're in a secret chamber. I bet they worshiped it. Are there a crapload of footprints on the ground around us? 13. Want to take a candle as a souvenir? Yeah. Well, let's do that, then. I can throw you. Taking it back to the old school. That's a little careless. That's like getting your hand on it right away. It's pushing the button. Ooh. Yeah. Okay. Okay. (laughing) Perfect. Are you ready to go? We take off-- wait, you've got to cut me. Wait, where are you going to cut me? Yeah, right in the middle, like the Bruce Willis cut. Okay. But not too deep, right? I want to be able to still make the ladies swoon. Why not? You were going to cut me with a Vestige? (grunting) Are you ready? Let's sell this shit. And I put him on my back and we take off running! (yelling) Oh, it's horrible! We burst out into the sunlight, and I intentionally trip and eat shit. Scanlan goes flying, boom! Oh my god! It was so vicious. No, there were bodies everywhere! Children! Women! They were stapled to the ceiling! And then there were just horrible-- 15. And a big skull. We reached out to touch it and it cut my face. Yeah, there were a ton of candles and a skull. There's only one show in a day; we don't want to miss it. Well, since I touched the skull and I cut myself, could you do me a little. (clicks tongue) No, don't you have a thing? If you care about me. Oh, that feels so much better. We're good. I agree. Yeah, it couldn't hurt. And he wanted a hat, how bad could he honestly be? Girl, you can always ride. Lead something right to us. Hold on, are you saying you don't hear anything right now? We should check it out. Have to cross the river. Right, but we got to cross this river to get to it. He said it's lazy, right? It's just going along, but I call bullshit 'cause we're in the Feywild. No, I wasn't. If I got into a rage, I can't be charmed. Hey, I've got an idea. How about you race in, grab Scanlan, I'll kill the other two-- Have you no mercy? Back-to-back?! Before you let me off the chain. There are trees, right? Who's benefitting from this charm? There's not somebody in a tree, hiding out? You're going to let me go? I would like to rage. I don't know if I've killed an elf in quite a while, so I'm going to aim my axe at the throat of the elf that's dancing. They didn't get back up? Sweet, I'm just grabbing Scanlan and running straight through. 25. 20. 20. Vax! (laughter) 22. Like a little dog on my calf? So the fire's out; instruments are gone. Should we loot the campfire? Yeah, that's it. Roll a d20. We're moving towards the Gilded Run. Oh, you told us about that earlier. We make people sigh a lot. Are we trampling anything as we're walking? Can I jog up to Garmelie and Vex real fast? You said that there were lycans at some point, and you said they move through the trees, right? Would that be these trees? Right. Have you seen a lycan? Great. We should be keeping an eye on the trees. Well, they're here. Shit. I match his step. I'm super restless. Have you fought a werewolf before? Have you fought a lycan? Is it just brute strength? It also bears remarking that Garmelie said we're not supposed to side with either, right? No, we're destroying one of their relics. Let's just go over there, do a little recon, and then we'll make up our minds. Go see the pixies. We send in Garmelie. If he dies, then we make a choice. Do you have a revision to that plan? Wow, you're so brave. They're going to be pixies with giant dickbutts everywhere. How tiny? Well, let's go get eyes on them, shall we? I feel like "cute" is the last word we should use for this. Should we look for perimeter alarms or traps? All right, Pass Without a Trace? That was awful. 15. What! I hate spiders. I like the latter of those two. Did they say to bring one back? Or to break it? The relic. You ever stepped on an anthill, right? It gets real nasty, real fast. Like forest wasps. What if we asteroid-dropped Keyleth from 500 feet? You'd be in your stone elemental form, it'd be no problem for you. I vote we don't fuck with the pixies. Never thought I'd say that. What, you'd waste Hallucinatory Terrain? When else are you going to use that? Third option, we say fuck the lycans, fuck the pixies, and we just keep going. All in favor of Hallucinatory Terrain, raise your hand. Weren't you dropping little green rocks? So we can find our way back to the lycans, right? Okay. Let's do it. Are we running back to the lycans or to the Shademirk? I've got Garmelie. Natural 19. I'm looking for lycans, too. I'm just being honest! 24. Fuck that little bastard. Wait. You can go invisible. Is it magic? Can you tell? Yeah, have a look. Cut me real quick. Can I take out my bloodaxe and go up to the magic barrier and hit it as hard as I can? 22. How do I do that? I forget. I'm kidding. 16. Sweet. Natural one. Ow. I just don't think we can go this way. (belches) Oh, that's true. It didn't hurt us when we just ran into it. I have a proposal. Why don't we make our way back to the pixie dome and say oh, we were chased by these horrible lycans! We wanted to kill them, but we got stuck when we hit this invisible wall. Could you do anything to help us get rid of the lycans? And then we play both sides of the coin. All right. You take first watch. We're going to zonk out. Is this shit on camera? We're recording, right? Twice in a fucking row? What are the chances? Do it again. It's like a Plinko machine. They saw you. What did they do to you? I'll stay up. You can cuddle with me. I know. Ten. Yeah, fireflies. What, the little lights? Oh. I freeze in an exotic pose. Eight. A six and a two. One look and they ran. What? Yeah, pickled herring, and I've been grabbing stuff as we walk through. No, look. We've got to talk to them anyway, right? We're not going to run. How? Yeah, just keep sleeping. No! I actually go back to sleep, too. The cups are bigger than they are. Oh, you made drowning pots for us all. How lovely. It's going to be a threat. Yeah, don't go through that wall. But bidet. No, it's cool. Please, do as you will. Let them feel at ease. Go ahead. Natural one. (laughs) I'm stoned. Beautiful. That was too good. How many points of damage was that? 15. I can break. Somebody lost an arm that way. I tried to be diplomatic. Yeah, but I thought we were all-- never mind. People were preparing tea, you were being cordial. I was trying to be disarming. Next time, everything dies. No way. Fucking golden snitch. I'm looking at it. What is the deal? They made it, didn't they? The cutest swear ever. Diplomacy really isn't that bad! I'm going to throw my weapons in the river. Hold on, I'll be right back. Why, thank you. All the wolves are back. What happened? Oh, really? Oh, so something happened, didn't it? Really? They fought hard? We're going to kill more now? Any tips? Advice? Don't think that's a problem. Are we cool with the wolves now? Absolutely. I walk up to Lord Pup. The gray ground that's been burned, is it just... Not everything else? I feel like we just killed FernGully. Oh, we're here! Why is reaching the Gilded Run a bad thing? Like rapids? Must've been a cool fight. With werewolves in tow. Not the rest of them? He's going to steal our shit. I was trying to be diplomatic, all right? I checked off the box! Next time, napalm. I even gave willingly. Not yet we haven't.
