So good. You're cultists? The prologue is so good it is currently encompassing Brian Wayne Foster's life. Is that the third time we've had him? In our lifetime? Like Halley's Comet, you always come around. I think your language was actually pretty good. Yeah. We still dropped a few. Chicago is a tiny town, though. There's not really a lot that's there. It's a couple trains or little puddle-jumper flights to get there. It was one roll! Never again. We're all fucked. What's the lawmaster's name? At the Song and Supper Inn We’ve got to figure out where fucking Lord Sutan is, right? We don't have any eyes on that location. Where would we find something that's handwritten? Would that come from them, you think? Yeah, we didn't really check to see if they had signed any of them, did they? I was thinking, do they have post here in this city? Someone that comes and picks up mail? Could we jack some of her fucking outgoing mail? What time is it? What's the exact time? No, I'm just kidding. What the fuck are you talking about? What if we divide our forces for now and try to find that handwriting sample? One of us goes and looks for the post, the other one tries to find those public records. Yeah, she was kind of unpleasant. Yeah, she wasn't really about that fan life. Possibly, but if we go by there, we can't be seen. Or knock on the back door, if such a thing exists. Is that how we want to find Lord Sutan's address? That seems like a good idea. So you're saying Ulog probably is in trouble and is going to roll over on us in order to get something taken off of him. To Dolan's, then. Yeah, you said there's no back door, right? Side windows, anything like that? Well, it should be one of the three of us, because that's who they'll know. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, I'm going to fucking change it up. Is there a little alley that I can pop into before I head over to his place of residence? Yeah, I cast Disguise Self and I turn back into that-- black cloak with gold trim, the long black hair-- That's right. Nice. Yeah, if you look like you-- We don't want to have them see us going over there. Cool. All right. Oh, what's the sign? A peacock? Was that supposed to be a hawk? A pigeon? (pigeon cooing) Fair enough, it's a pigeon. A feral pigeon. If there's trouble. LAURA and All right. I walk over to Dolan's house. Yes, it is-- I bring word from the Mighty Nein. May I come in, please? Is there anyone in the room that I don't see besides Horris and Dolan? I'll drop the disguise. I apologize. We realize that after you-- (drawl) I apologize. (laughter) Great. Will do. Another thing that we realized-- in our efforts to frame and forge, which are vast, you don't happen to have any handwriting from Lord Sutan, do you? There was nothing that ousted you from your business, any sort of receipt, or-- Is there anyone else in the area that we should know that he does business with, that he might communicate with regularly? There's a pen pal. And finding out who the pen pal is-- No, there's no fucking pigeons. Ren Sutan. That's who he wrote to, though. It's who he wrote to. Well, he sounds like a real son of a bitch. This Ren Sutan, any idea where we might be able to find him? A physician also. A dark physician, most likely, hmm? Yeah, rampant where I'm from. Just real fucking dark. Indeed I will. Indeed. You probably will not be hearing from us again before the task is done. SAM and No. Was I supposed to say stuff about the High-Richter? Thank you. We won't trouble you any longer. Song and Supper Inn. Mm-hmm. Lock that door behind me, and I leave. Stupid pigeons. SAM and Yeah, but I'm not sharing it. Yep. Got it. Got it, no problem. Read it, looked at it, I understand what it looks like. Let's go. (laughter) Nope, sorry, not going to help you. A whole bunch of stuff, but I can't say it around them, I just won’t, out of principle. Now, see, if you ask nicely, yeah, things will ha-- I walk back up to the door. (laughter) One more thing. Totally forgot to ask, you don't happen to have any handwriting from the High-Richter do you? Yeah, I know. (laughter) Have a good day. No. None. Yeah. Blah blah blah, Ren's address and the address. Now you got it. Was that mentioned? Oh, okay, yeah, that. Blah. We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's stay on task. Let's head to the Gilded Willows where in the Tri-Spire, where the fucking Scottsdale party-- What do these notes say, Skyskate Park and Constellation Boulevard. Yeah that thing. Yeah, I was writing real fast. Just recon. We're trying to see what this place looks like, if we can see Lord Sutan. Then we'll make a decision if we go after his son or not. Who maybe has some of his handwriting. Sure. Handwriting. And see if Ren's a son of a bitch. Yeah. Yeah me too, because I can't make it through the gates. That's what I was wondering what you were talking about. Because she's got a cloak now. Cool. Caleb, where you want to go buddy? Wait, they're both Sutan. Yeah, you won't bring back Clarota or nothing, it'll be great. Can't be. Should we meet back at the Song & Supper Inn at what, sunset? Okay, fair enough. Leaky Tap. Hashtag NBC Blindspot. I just got a shit-load of ball bearings. Yep. You can see if it hurts your hand if you touch it. No fucking way. (laughs) Ah, you son of a bitch. (vaporized noise) Yeah, new character. That's some Fight Club shit. (coo) Remember (coo). (coo) Hunter's Mark. (laughter) Turn Undead (coo). You've never heard of safety in numbers and all that shit? Yeah man. I just figured you'd be a part of this. Just some simple reconnaissance. See if we can see Ren, maybe have a conversation with him. If he's not a total prick, I don't know, maybe he's got some of his dad's handwriting. Great, we're going to head towards the Apple Tree Tuneship? What did I write here? Thank you. Oh god. Nine, twelve. 13. Guided Hand Infirmary? Right. He's a physician. Well, before we put a personal touch on it, do you people with sneaky abilities want to see what you can see in the windows? Seniors '99! (laughter) 11 strength. Okay… Oof! Oh, you know, it ran up on the roof. We were trying to chase her down. You want to see if maybe she ran around the corner? Yeah. They're tricksy like that. Tell you what, if I see it, I'll call out. What's your name? Simon, okay. Simon, I'll call out if I see him. Why don't you see, if you run the other way, see if you can find him. (laughing) Oh my god. Right. Unless Ren is actually on the inside. If they had an office, maybe we could rifle through some-- Yeah. Or just ill on the front doorstep and keep them occupied. Yeah. I could, you know, kick the shit out of Nott in the face, and then be like (yelling). I could kick the shit out of Nott in the face, and then like-- Although, he's a physician. So he might try to, you know, check. And I think, up to touch, it falls apart. Yeah, I mean, I could mimic whatever you have, and try to stay at arm's length. I like it. Yep. Yep. I like that. Then you two try to get into the office somehow? I'm assuming there is. It's a doctor's office, right? I think that makes sense. We'll cause a ruckus, see what you can find. Is it? TALIESIN and Well, they're not here. It was a Chihuahua on a chain. Fierce as shit. Spiked collar, tongue out-- How long do you need to make your face all lepered up? Oh my god. For fuck's sake, Jesus. Really? Okay. All right. I do! I'm all about this. Let's go find breakfast. Jesus. Can we find a tavern? I think we need sunny-side up, don't we? I'll pay for it. Don't. It's on me. Do I dare ask what it looks like? Why would you even? That's in your brain forever. Are we ready to do this? Are you ready to make a damn fool of yourself? All right. Let's go. We go up to the front door. Where are y’all going? (coughing) No, you need help. It's real gross. I go the opposite direction he starts walking. (hacking cough) My allergies are going to be shit in about five seconds. My worst nightmare. (hacking cough) I'm standing there like (hacking cough). I think I shit my pants! Oh, lord. Oh no. Did you get anything? Well don't give up! (cough) I walk out towards them. Do you have a privy? I think I shat myself. Yeah. (cough) I have a terrible cough and apparently my breakfast didn't agree with me and I coughed a little too much and felt a pack in my pants. 15. 16. I think I got shit in my pants. Can I visit the bathroom real quick? I don't want it running down my thighs and stuff. You don't have anything in the building? All right. Yeah. I go in the room. Can I have a little privacy while I check my undercarriage? Am I in the room by myself? Can I cast Disguise Self and give myself the same sort of clerk/orderly outfit as… Maybe not looking exactly like one of them, but like them in a uniform. Okay. Can I exit the room and come out into the hall? Get him out of here. I walk past them, towards the office where the doctor is. Can I turn, and as I start to close the door behind me, can I look down the hallway and see if anybody is walking towards me in the hallway. Is it relatively clear? Can I grab a handful of papers off the desk and put them under my shirt and start walking out? That was very unruly; I need to excuse myself for a moment. I’ll head out of the infirmary. I’m heading out of the infirmary and I’m going to start wrapping around the building towards the side of the building that he was in. Run! Can I point off in a different direction than Molly’s running, since I look like a hospital clerk nurse? 15. As we’re walking back, can I start looking over the papers, looking for some sort of signature that says Richter or Prucine or anything? Yeah, it was just on top of the desk. I don’t really have anything to hold him. Crown of Madness! Great success. Went off without a hitch. We found Ren. We-- That’s actually exactly what happened, it just didn’t go as well as you thought it might go. Great minds think alike, though, Jester. How’d it go for you two? Not promising. It’s an infirmary. They got to see terrible people in there all the time. Might get us in past that outer wall, at least. Yeah, it’d be obvious. Sign it somebody else’s name. “As discussed.” And no perfume on the letter. Was it a talking mastiff? Nott. Nor in your closet. Next day for me. Yeah, all black looks like you're up to no good. Yeah, no point in worrying, it only makes it hurt twice. Molly. You'll pay for all of it? What about a sign-off, like, "The Knights of Requital are rising." I'll be out front, I can be a crownsguard if I need to. Lord Sutan. Song and Supper Inn. 12. Mindful of the damn rats. Where letter-R letter-U? Yeah, he should be a part of the team that goes in. And Far Cry 5! Or four better than the original. Takes place in America. Really? Why? 14. Uh! I can do that now. That’s true. I could wait. I am. Yeah that was at the High-Richter’s. The tree means worst case scenario. Oh my god. Let this happen. Let this happen. Triple dungeness crabs. We are now. (laughter) Did they go already? 16. Not yet. I should. Yeah, I'll wander into an alley. They're going in the house. Yeah. Mm-hm. I have a very bad feeling about these suits of armor. I'm over here. 11. Fuckin' focus! Yep, I saw it. I had that in my one-shot. It's like a cobra ready to strike! Unprepared. Just use a d4. I’m not in this one, fucker. You guys are the best, that's the last we heard. (laughter) Yeah, get it! He doesn't know who's doing it, that's okay. She doesn't know. Same six seconds! Are you? Oh shit. Fuck. Doesn't she fail two? It can't have that many hit points, right? Goddamn it. It works. How'd you guys die? A rug. What? It moves into the fireplace? (screams) Whoa! Return that damage. You're a god! Wow! Roll that fucking shit. Oh, fuck. Terrible, just awful. We're the best. A 12 hits. Guys. It's going as well as the hospital. 17. Prucine. Do what? Yes, of course. Yeah. (clears throat) I walk up to the four of them. I heard there's a disturbance over here. I need some assistance, please. There's a rowdy bunch over here, been drinking too much already, anticipating the festival. Would you come with me? Oh, god. 13. We've got this. (chuckling) You pulling your eyebrows off? Come on! I love his facial expressions from here. Faces of death. Do you want to look like the High-Richter and walk in without saying anything? Let's do it. Yep, I'll Disguise Self to look like a crownsguard. Yep. We're going in. I'm about ten feet in front of her, and I walk up. All right lads, open up. She's in one of her moods. Had wine spilled all over her. Hurry up! 22. Quickly, I like this detail. Open up. You fools, open the door. Don't you see she's in a state? I am so sorry, High-Richter. I assure you, this night is almost over. Would you hurry up?! I follow in behind her. (breathe deeply) I've got darkvision. Can I see anything? We should go up. Don't have to do it all. Jester, I know we have to move, and it's not our thing, can we roughly check the stairwell for traps? Natural 20. This is set up to-- wait a minute. If we came home, there's got to be a way to turn it off, right? I mean, if she had walked in, she wouldn't be trying to look out for the traps. Maybe there's something by the door jamb or in the wall, or something we can press. Can we check the door jambs and the walls? The same time, one at each. TRAVIS and Okay. We head up the stairs. Each one. One, two, three, one two three. Our front door creaked open when we came in? Not today. We've got to keep going. We can't stop now. 19 investigation. Yeah, one more time. Anything that's an obvious trap in the bedroom. 23 investigation. Fuck. There's a key. Can I reach underneath the desk and behind it? Underneath it. 17. The priority is the letter. Let's start getting that paperwork. Aren't we supposed to toss the room, aren't we supposed to make it-- no, we're coming in and out, so-- Let's leave it alone. Let's get the letters in and the seals. Let's place it all. What are you doing? Come on, the letters. I mean, right on the desk, right? We should put it right there. We've seen those cords before. Do not touch that! We got to get out of here. Let's go! We laid the letters. Touch nothing! Let's go! I'm the last one to leave the room. No! Did you reach for it? I was the last one out of the room. Put it back. Yes! I was up here first! I said I was the last one in that room. Fuck. 13. (whoosh) Leave no trace. Put it back, or I'll-- Put it down, or I'll leave you here-- (buzzing sound) My hand starts to glow with Eldritch Blast energy. I will fucking leave both of you here. We're either a team, or you're working for yourselves. Decide. Yeah, do it anyway! Oh my god. Yeah, we got to go. Jester, help me! We start backing up, yeah. Oh my god. Caleb's unconscious; we've got to get him out. I have a healing potion, I'll put it in Caleb's mouth. Yeah. 15. Bunch of teens and a five! Come on. Those men were flying! Let's get back to the Leaky Tap. We've seen the power of the Dwendalian Empire. That was more than anything I've ever seen, we've got to get back. Neither have I. Lightning, it turned him almost into ash. Let's get back, we can talk about it when we're in our rooms safe. Ulog sacrificed himself. He killed himself and the Richter. Hell yeah. I cast Armor of Agathys on myself. Undercommon, anyone? It went perfectly, ha! And Nott took it anyway!
