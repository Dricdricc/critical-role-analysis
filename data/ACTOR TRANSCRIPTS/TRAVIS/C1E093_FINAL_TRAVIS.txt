Meatstick? Oh, Brian Wayne Foster also said the Wondercon panel will be on G&S's YouTube Friday at 8PM, in case you missed it on Talks Machina. You were tripping last session. Telepathically? Are people just too lazy to use their mouths? Whatever. Samesies. I think that's right. Go with your instincts. You know, there is really one way to find out. But you could, he's saying you could have your advantage on that. I can't see it? I totally know he was (sings) dancing, dancing, dancing! Bears first. Ah! I want to get in on the melee party. May I run up to his opposite side? Just where his right arm is. Just so he's got escorts on each end. May I smash together my Titanstone Knuckles? It's like the Autobots. What's up, bitch? May I make two reckless attacks? Thank you. That's a 30. 19. Nice. That is 36. No, that can't be. 33. No, I did the second hit. 18 for the first one. These are two-handed, by the way. 22 for the second one. Oh, and this is the Thrower. It's still the Dwarven Thrower, though, the hammer. Can I use my bonus action to go into a frenzied rage? Thanks. And I don't get to attack. Teach me. Same thing. Two! Why do you sound like a bear? Should've gone with Gil. Seven. I am resistant to fire. So I'm resistant to fire, but this is boiling oil, does that count? That was the turn, right? Oh shit. God, son of a bitch. 12. What, a 15 and 12 don't make it? Resistant, so I got halved. He's real strong. Get out of that hallway! Come on, Trink. Mr. Mercer, we pulled you over for speeding tonight. (different voice) No, I wasn't speeding tonight. The pit fiend was speeding. Fix everything. What sound do you make when you hit him? Work on your war face. Not a problem. 14. Into the wall, or out from the wall? We're in an engine. It might be balloon animals, don't sweat it yet. How do you know it's not molten steel? Kidding. If you've got to, you know who to aim it at. Either me or Taryon. I mean, Doty. Or whoever. Osh kosh magosh, it's time for hammers. Can I advance through the ring of fire and on him more? That's not actually a terrible idea. Because at the worst I just fall off one side or the other into the boiling blood-- I'll just stay in the ring of fire. I don't want to test the Sriracha pit just yet. Because he's prone, do I get advantage on the attacks without having to use Reckless? Can I make all three of my frenzied attacks? With advantage. 35 for the first one. Which is ten, 20. 26? Nice. That's 29? Ten. 26 again. 26 points of damage. 19. C'mon, 37. That's 22 points of damage. Can I use my Action Surge? Second level in Fighter. Groggy got two more hits. I can only do it one time. That's a 23. 25 points of damage. And that's 29. Hits? 21 points of damage. But I'm cooking. Yeah, they're really strong hits because I'm burning while I'm doing it. Literally whaling through the fire and just angry. Advantage on that. That sucks, that's a seven. I have resistance to fire, it's okay. 14, thank you. I still have my movement, can I move out of the ring? Oh, I would like to, after all the smashing is done. Just on the cusp of it. Probably not. Is the portcullis closed behind you? Come on, Gil. 18. It's just like a spiked helmet stabbing me in the cheek. This one has spikes on the inside too? And it's hot? (warbled scream) Is that how you sound, Tary? What sweet hell did your imagination come from? How many ds of what did you roll? He still looks nonplussed? Just chill? Fear Aura checks? Oh my god. What would Doty do? Just spinning in place (confused screams). (laughter) (laughs) That dice sucks. I'm going to try and get out of the cage. I have advantage on those. 27. Yep. Yep. Yeah, I do! I'm going to throw-- Oh, I just see a column of fire. But I see a motherfucker behind me, don't I? He going to turn to jelly. Do I have my movement? I would like to visit him, please. Hi! Smash. Yay! Natural 20. Yeah, I know! That's 24-- That's two additional damage die. 30. Yeah. They were all three really low-damage die rolls. Oh! Actually, I can reroll a one or a two, which was that last one! Nine, that's better. Cool, huh? Bubble throat! Get another Grit back. Tary Jumbo! I've no idea what this means. Matthew! Oh god. Why do you need Hunter's Mark? Tickle! Serpentine! Now what? Are you super strong? 24. Yeah! Yeah! 'Sup, playa? Damn, you be talkin' my lingo! Maybe we just toss him in the blood. Can I see that, please? Does the axe do anything when I hold it? I really think that's a matter of perspective? Yeah. I take it. Can I put it in the pool of blood? It dissolved it? That's a deep pool, you guys. Like seriously, drowning warning, okay? Tax collectors. Are they like you? I mean like (roars)? Oh. Oh, are you going to hand it over here now? Thanks. Is it really rotten? Yeah, but we can check out the place until they get here. Can we check the rest of the room first, before we leave? Especially that back wall. Not me, necessarily. Yep. Okay. 15. What? (yelps) I'm too smart again! (laughter) I think you're overthinking this. We got Dis. I'm taking my cues from you, here. I can't say it. You've got say it. You tried Parseltongue. Holy shit. Aw, Doty, poor bastard! [break] Okay. 17. (spits) That's what I've got, too. Allergic to hell. (laughs) Five experience. Can I try and just muscle out this bitch, since I'm still wearing my Gauntlets? 24. I kinda maybe wrap them around, just for a little super there. Hell chains. You want me to write some stuff down for you? Can I try mine? Would anybody care if I try mine? Kame-- -- hame-- -- what do you mean, quiet? I can't hold it, it's so powerful, oh! (yells) (laughter) I guess it's not a-- what would I add, my strength? 26, so, 52? Which is eight, and I rolled a 18. 1d4. Strength modifier, that's ten! 20. You loosened it for me. Nice job. Ooh, good call-- Nope! Wait a minute, but doesn't the floor burn? Are we going to flip out of that shape real fast? But we're animals though, we're not insects. We're animals. No. Yeah, I remember we had this conversation before. Not insects. What happens if we hit a door on this right-left-straight-straight-left-straight-right? I don't mind starting out that way. What do our bats sound like? Ooh, wait! Well-- You don't speak that shit, is the problem. I know it's not a bear, but at least they both start with a... D. Take off, I'll follow you. I'm following Vex out. Straight. Yeah. Pass Without a Trace. 25. No, no, we'll burn out of it. We'll burn out of it. Not a great sense of smell. That's for sure. Left! 'I poop'. One hit point? 'Aw, man!' You're a bat. Yeah! Don't fuck me, Gil! That's it, go! 20. Tova had-- 15 to ten. What are you, Tary? Oh, shit. Rabies. Is it a blood pit or a lava pit? I'm just following Vex. I'm real good with directions but, let's be honest. You didn't even have time to ask that question. You're not going to move? I'm going to burn my "ashton" as a "darsh." (laughter) That was a big oversight. Oh my god, what the fuck were we thinking? Aw, man. That roll was bigger than I knew. You want to heal yourself? Potions? Stop saying it. You hungry? Yeah. You have any food? (laughter) Go running in 50 feet. (war cry) Am I in melee distance? Reckless attacks! 29. Yes. 24 points. Second one, reckless. Natural 20. 24, 27, 34. 34 points of damage. Did two additional damage dice rolls. Initial one, and then I did two more d10s. 34. Yeah, because I have two levels of brutal critical. Yeah. Misses! Misses! Hits! Word. May I make a retali-- Reckless, please. 30. Yeah. 24. Sweet! (cheering) Do it here so they don't know which way we went. Yeah, but they don't know which direction we went. The chain devil. Oh my god. What size is that thing? So it's fire giant size. 13. Wow. You. No, I'm not relatively low. Where am I on the map? Yeah, door-- smash it open, right? Crack of doom. 23. What do I roll? Oh yeah, that makes sense, right? Nine. 25. I have one more hit. I'll stride forward and swing away. Reckless, please. Because why not. That's a million. It's 32. 22. No. How much movement do I have left? Okay. Two more squares. I'll come back out the door and towards Keyleth. Run real fast. She's like okay, I've got to get-- (poof) A chain prison? You've got this. Who's the one who's back there? Okay. Yeah, I would like to move towards Percy. Okay. I'm not raging. Do I need to break your chains or just touch you? All right. I just grab your hand, and I'll lean back like this. Oh my god, Matthew! Chain golems, all the demons.
