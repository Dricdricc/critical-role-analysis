That chair has been violated by more than a few people. They told me to wear pants. A quote, right above your head, "Honored and terrified." Kings of the kingdom! We don't even know, but you do! We're at SacAnime, January 5th or 6th or something. It's the first week of January. We hated missing when Sam and Liam went. Yes! I am Lohkor Windfallow, paladin. Keeper of virtues and righteousness. I am devilishly handsome, and I don't play well with others because of that devilish handsomeness. But my skills are always for sale and my fellows seem to appreciate my roguish good looks. It's good. No, it frames your face very well. No reason to spend all that time by yourself. I guess so, that does describe us, doesn't it? A what? Explosive? Yeah, but we should present a united front, though. I mean, people should be able to see that we are a group. I'm sure this morning's fare will be also a part of our arrangement? I think someone broke the lock. You don't need to. They're just there. Quazi, you are astute, as always. Bundle, would you mind checking the lock to see if there's--? Oh, no. It's cold in here. Yes. Let me see if I recognize these tracks. We've discussed this. It's potpourri. Well, it's just potpourri. No, for the fourth time. I'd like to try. Natural 20. With my die! And because I'm handsome. Are you amused by the boosh? The tracks lead to this bush. If you see just beyond there's a recess in the mountains. It's like four-- what is it? How far about? Indeed it is. My hypothesis exactly. Absolutely. I start ripping the dried brush out of the-- Are you sure? We have extra daggers and all sorts of things. We will take care of this and be back expediently. You can count on us! Can you see in the dark? I have a torch. I have ten of them. You're so squishy! To make you feel better I will be second. Wow. 13 as well. Are you making this up? Nine. Of course. I haven't. Did we ask how many candles were missing? Boxes of them. Who's feeling particularly sneaky right now? That's right. Feel like journeying in a little bit? Seeing what else you can see? See if you can see any of the other candles. You sure you heard blow things up? We've got to stop them. There's nine of them. There's five of us. Shit. Go cut the bridge? What did you roll? She had 23 right? MATT and Oh, what was it? I'm 15. L-O-H-K-O-R. Quasimodo. I don't know why we always try and do this stealthily. I get the warhammer out and I'll reach forward to the one and take a big swing right in his face. 18. That's 1d8. 13 points of bludgeoning damage. I have another one because of extra attack? Nice! 15. Nice. And that is seven points of bludgeoning damage. Yes! I turn to the rest of them and I say Let them have it! And I take off running into the fray. 16. New class abilities. We're all like, flexing in the thing that we've never played before. Son of a Bundle! Still with the performance issues, eh, Bundle? Misses. That does hit. Yeah. Just not the face. Yeah, I am over these guys right next to me. Warhammer! That is a 22. That is 12 points of bludgeoning damage. Still standing, eh? Round two! That is a 25. Another 12 points of bludgeoning damage. With my bonus action I turn and point to the last standing one My eye sees you. That's a one. We've got to go! Double dash, all the way out! It's going to be an early night. Four. I'm putting out the fire in my hair. I use Lay on Hands to put out the fire. Before. Much better than after. I mean we're hot on the trail. That's not long enough for hit dice and stuff though? You gave the golden snitch away, Taliesin. This is the beginning of the end. No! Don't you want to ask maybe what they were doing down here, or what their plans might be? I think it might be wise. I know that about you. Can I go over and pick it up by the back of the neck? Hello, friend. Before I let one of these fine people-- I know, a very sad face. Before one of these fine people sends you to your maker, what were you doing in here? Yes, friend. Much more work for you, friend. Wicksis. Reeksus. Yes, I am aware of people town. King Togwaggle, is he here with you now, close by? Back that way? And what would we do with him? Quazi, do you think maybe you could convince him to show us safe passage? Yes, you are. Just so we make sure you don't break your other hand, she's going to make sure that you're secure. Through the door then. Is there a latch, a door knob? Hmm, a lock. If only we had some fire. Eating mushrooms. No. I'm afraid they might release spores and then become airborne which is why I only recommend trying to burn it first. They don't let cursing happen in mage school either? We join. What about blue? I'll take the blue one. Yeah. It's the-- they're real-- Do I know anything about this blue fungus? 16. Now, because you're next to me I have Aura of Protection which is plus two to saves? Yes! 21. Yeah! Show me. I highly recommend the blue fungus. Somehow I know that to be true about you. I'll cast Command on him and say drop that wicked snake! 13. We're doing our best outside inflatable people. Quazi? Feel like introducing yourself? Ooh! You've got sentient weapons in this thing! The little gems are floating in a triangle? Nicely done! Your baptism is going well! I just want to go deadlift right now. Who's cool? You said "They're pretty cool." Staff of flirting. Now, now, you know King Tagwaggle will be very disappointed-- Togwaggle will be very disappointed if we are not brought before him. Can I join her with my heightened senses from my blue fungi? 18. I could stun him. Might. We'd have to be fast. And no one could fall. Why did you think I was saying that you would fall? Was I? One of us could fall. Yeah, I think we have to get to-- did you trust Skeever? Yeah. They had to have gotten there for a reason, right? Fly fly away. Fly far away. Sure! Wow. One. I would like to see it. Yep. One time. Throw on four. Throw on three. Throw on one. Creature, though. Yes! That's a great item! Oh my god! Damn! I could try to stun him if we all wanted to make a break for one side or the other. I'm not sure if it would work, so, any other ideas? Wasn't Reek lying? I cast Zone of Truth. Cheeker-- what's his name? Oh, right, Reek. Do you really know the way back to Tagwaggle? Which direction is it? He did. I'm sure it's nothing personal, though! No, he has to answer. While the Zone of Truth is still active, Bundle, what are you the most afraid of? No, see, if it was a spider, then I could take care of it for you. I don't want to leave you in an awkward situation. Do it. Why'd you give the Snitch back?! Doesn't seem so scary! Across. I did have Reeksus with me. Reeksus, now that your lies are through, lead the way. Quietly! I have actually not gone up against a dragon. I just want to put that out there. Reeksus, one dragon? Just one? Yes, let's stealth for a minute. Is she asking Quazi, or is she asking Vax? It's still sleeping. What else do we see in this--? Okay. With advantage still? Blue fungus still? Thank you, Taliesin. 19. I bet he's a heavy sleeper. Yes! Are there any other exits out of this room? Not to be a stickler for our contract, but do we see any candles? That's a lot of dice. I'll go. That's a five. Nope! Five again! Let the dice hit the floor. Yeah, can I-- Oh, I was, wasn't I? I still had Reek. Did he get smoked by the fire too? MATt No, because he was a number of feet behind you. He's like, (gasping). But you can make the rest of the way if you would like to. Yeah, it was! 19. I run forward with my warhammer and I'm going to take two attacks and I'm going to dump Divine Smite into both of them. Smite. 22 for the first one. And 16 for the second one. Okay. 13 plus-- what's Divine Smite? There it is. 2d8. 25 points of radiant damage. Yes, it does. You have plus two because you're near me. Ten. You get a plus two, Liam. What did you roll? Ten here as well. Me too. Just you, right? Oh yeah, you roll that. Oh my god, I can't grab it. Stop it. This is the slipperiest dice ever. Damn. 12. (yelling) Double dash! Oh shit! 14. Can I Cure Wounds on myself? Cure Wounds! Yeah, do the hit dice. I've got it. Advantage. Blue fungus! That was crap all around. Nine. Ten. Well, there's a shitload of wax ahead. Yeah. I think the coast is clear. Yeah. Does the staff have any suggestions? Who's playing the violin? I thought it was a little gnome? Oh my god. What the hell? What's Rakanishu? "Finally happened." 18. The one syllable protest! Can I push out of the crevice and run at King Togwaggle? I can get right on him? Can I use my Hammer of Justice, "Target a creature within 15 feet of you to make a "constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or become stunned until the next round" on my next turn? 13! Yes! Yeah! Do I get a bonus action with that crazy move or is that it? Yeah, I want to pour some Searing Smite into it as well. Oh that's right, never mind. That's what it is, your call. Yeah. Jesus, 57 points? Oh it does? My turn? Hold real still for me (whoosh). Two big attacks with the warhammer. I'm going to dump Searing Smite into the second one. Oh advantage, that's right. I mean they're crits, aren't they? So 18 to hit. 12 points of damage on the first one. Oh yeah. 24. Yeah, oh I'm sorry, right. So 14 plus five. 19. 21. 21 again, and I'm dumping Searing Smite into it. He does a constitution-- Yeah, sorry, what'd I say? Oh damn it. (laughing) Sorry. Stunned, I walk up with the warhammer, spin it in my hand, and do one, two, with the second one arcing up with all that radiant damage. Coming under his chin, trying to change the way his pretty face looks. Yeah. Electric guitar in the background. (guitar solo) Constitution saving throw. Misses! Sorry. (pained noises) I run forward. I run forward with two attacks from my warhammer against Rakanishu. That is 16? 23? Ten and I will use my bonus action to dump Searing Smite into this one. So that's an extra five points of what kind of damage? I'm not sure. I think it's fire. That was so smart! Well, cool. Good deal. All right, next! It was ten points. Whoa. Sleep. Jesus! Nope. Oh, me! I run up behind and I hit it! 20! Yay. I rolled the wrong thing. Six points of damage. Second one. 16. There you go. Cool. That's it. 9d4? Uno mas. That misses. That's a 24. That's nine points of bludgeoning damage, and I'll put some Branding Smite into it, as well, as a bonus action. Do I get a bonus action as a reaction? My turn. Two attacks against him. That's a 23, should hit, and the second one is-- no, that's not a hit. Nine points of bludgeoning damage, and as a bonus action, I'm going to put Branding Smite into it, which is 2d6 radiant damage, and the enemy glows bright. Four points of radiant damage. Grundlemeyer. Snuff that flame? 16. Yeah, jump into the latrine, and maybe let the raging current take us wherever. 16. Oh, you do?! 16. Is my plate mail a problem? He died. Show him the bag.
