Did I find anything on Smash-Face? We need to check all the rooms that go downstairs first. "Got an empty house." I run out to the door to the left. To the uncovered areas. Can I grab the rug and yank it? (excited shouting) I found a hatch! Oh sorry. (quieter) I found a hatch. Vax or Vex, will you come check this hatch for boobies? (laughter) No boobies. Yeah! (growls) Okay, I jump. Um. Ooh! I bet there's treasure in there! Can I open it? Well, should I just smash it? Three, two. Grog smashes. Is the desk made out of the stone? I was going to ask, are you good with the coffin? Okay. I smash the shit out of it, in an effort to see what's underneath. Not anymore. This one's not on fire. Yet. Light this candle! We're out by now. Aw. It's going to be a thing. Pizza! [break] Does it matter on a one? Ten? Total ten. 11. 43? Seeing the chaos, can I get the Dust of Tracelessness and start trying to sprinkle it behind us? Closed and locked? Look for an ambush around. Can we look around? Rooftops? Sides of the building? I actually rolled a 17. Canvass the building. No. That's it, yeah. Right. Vox Machina. You might be cool, but we're fucked. Aren't there a bunch of zombie stone giants walking around? Tonight? Aren't they stronger then? Yeah, they said a river is what the... right? Nah, it's going to fuck us. We've got to rest. What about the people who absolutely need a short rest at the minimum stay. Yeah. Yeah, they're standing up for themselves. Who did? What? How many Sunbeam hadoukens do you have left, Keyleth? If we get a short rest, how many do you get? That's what I'm talking about. They're vampires. Those are two different things, huh? Grog learns. (laughter) I'm going to roll four hit dice. How much time do we have before the sun that is being blocked by the rainclouds goes down? Yes! Right out front, we hear it? Should we go outside and see how they're doing? We go out front. Once we're outside, how far away is that giant that was felled? So that's it for the big houses, right? Just the castle. Wow. Let's go. I think that's-- Should we go to the tree? Seven. Or maybe they cut them down. They cut their dead down. You engage, they'll follow, we go, we fight another day, we sleep in the rafters and wait until daybreak. All 30 to 50 of them? Kill them all? Are we going to the Alcove or going to the treeline? Do we go to the treeline by the castle? Aggressive flower girl. (laughs) You son of a bitch, I love it.
