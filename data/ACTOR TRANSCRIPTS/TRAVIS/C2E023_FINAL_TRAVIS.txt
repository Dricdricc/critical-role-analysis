Oh, no. Who was that masked man? Did you find what you needed in your car, Sam? There was a guy that-- you know what? It's not important. Great job. It doesn't matter, that's incredible. Wow. I forget, are we returning back to report in between missions, or are we doing a twofer? What spell's that? Sending? I guess that would cover it, then. You lost me a little. What time is it about, in the sky parts? Jester, maybe not just yet. Maybe before we go to sleep. And remember, he bleeds damaging liquids. Or something that we would totally do. I'm down for that. Two votes. Three votes. Four, five votes. Are you abstaining? I feel like I knew that about you. Sure. Maybe we have Nott bolt in, right, everybody else stand back, because you're super fast, right? Very dextrous? Yeah, then you run in and toss that sucker. If he pops out, we light it up from afar. Caleb, you got that photographic memory. You remember where those damn daggers are in the trees? I'm glad that's you. Wow. Back up! And it throws it back. Yeah, we should be stealthy. Big times are coming, Nott. Yeah guys, distance is key. And we're coming from? You do now. It's an unnecessary step. Just blow that thing up, man! Then you blow it up anyway! If you want, I can go. Smoke that for me! I'll hold Eldritch Blast until he's visible. Did we send him out there without matches? How's it look? But is it a long wick? MARISHA and Oh, geez! This is such a drunk Fourth of July problem. Jester! Go with him! You've got Pass Without Trace, just go with him! Okay, good. Look, it's got roots and all sorts of beautiful things. I'm unprotected. I just want to know yours first all the time. I want to know what you rolled. Oh, man. There you go, come on. Fjord got a four. Yeah, come on now! Fire! The wires crossed! You are just inching up. He stole you last time. You should have PTSD from this. You're right. Yep, like a pebble. Rock it! I'll move forward ten feet, and, with my bonus action, cast Hex on him for strength checks. Denied, and I'll launch two Eldritch Blasts in his direction. That's a ten on the first; that's going to miss. And 19 to hit. Seven! Seven points of damage! Wait, and a d6. Another four, total of ten. Oh, we can't fucking hit him. We had to have 100 gold, didn't we? Hah. You're like, I made it. No, not with blood spray. Run. (singing) Sail away, sail away, sail away. I'm going to move over here. Five, ten, 15. Yeah. I'm going to cast Witch Bolt at it. Yeah, whatever it is. 3d12. I have to roll to hit first. 16? Hi, d12. I missed you. (counting) 18 points. Lightning damage. Thank you for the reminder. Two. Solid 20 points. It does. That hits. That misses. That hits. (high-pitched yelp) I mean, (deeper grunt). Jeez Louise. That's an 11. That one saves. They both save. I think it was four. You can add four hit points, I think was the last Hex damage. My eyes! Let it stop you not, my friend! Nott? Nott. No, keep hitting it! I do?! Hit it again! (spraying) Just hit it! Oh no, I use my Relentless Endurance to (singing). Just hit it! I'm down. Ah! It was so cool! (sizzling) That is 20. Thank you. Please don't. Thanks, Jester. (death rattle) He's out. (death rattle) I'm back, I'm back. (laughter) Oh, my god. That was two death saving throws right there. It's like walking on the edge of a cliff in the middle of the night. And you didn't know how far the drop was, and you're just toeing the edge. No idea what was on the other side. Just do it. Just do it. Yeah, dude. 19. Ugh. I feel like this is a rough day. 11 points? I sit back up against the tree and sit there in the water, britches in the water, just not caring. Us and troll dongs, man! I'm sitting there, watching Caleb and Yasha walk off and feeling sorry for myself. Y'all mind if we take a short rest or something? I heal 39 points. I only have one hit dice left. 26 and ten silver. No, don't! No! Well, I'm glad we did that. Shall we continue on our way? Yeah, I just meant to-- Yeah, that didn't go the way I planned. My strategy went to shit. In my stomach? Just these abs, babe. (laughter) You feel all six of them. Eight of them. Nine. That is a-- what do you call it when you have-- oh shit, hernia. (laughter) Yeah, you shook it off. Yeah, thank you, Caleb. Appreciate that. No. All I could see is somebody go (fart sound). No, you're right on the nose. It's pretty miserable. The gates were pretty heavily watched, though. At war? No fear, we won't be too much longer. We're going to head back to Zadash after we take care of some other business. And we'll be sure to check in. Word will find its way to you soon. The Drowned Nest. Who would stay there right? I mean-- Do you feel safe here? I noticed your hood was up when you approached us. We'll send word. It was good to see you. Where the hell did Molly go? Papyrus. No business back there! 100% for sure. Yes, you can. We're weary travelers in need of respite and perhaps some drinks. Uma. (kiss) Matt "Oh! Well--" I was asking out of character, but okay. Did you give me the dirty hand, ma'am? Okay. That sounds absolutely fantastic. I got it. No problem. Thanks for making sure I was okay back there. I'll do that as well. It's exactly what I have. Is it a busy night? Any new travelers, anyone that caught your eye coming in before us? Well, I'm flattered. True. We'll find our way over to a table. We head over to a table in the corner to discuss. Well, we seem to be doing fairly well. How do we feel about setting out in the morning to-- Yeah, Shadycreek Run. Ophelia Mardun. Yeah, we can catch up on some rest. We got to get the carriage, right? Get the horses back. That means I got to go over to the-- Where did we stay before? I've got to get it from that guy. Yeah, but we don't know where the stables are. Uma, has anyone ever told you that you have eyes like the sea? Shit, nine. Come on, that's my jam! I'm not real practiced, I'm sorry. I should've said like the swamp, right? Your eyes are like stagnant water, green and-- no? Green and yellow in places. Yeah, but you know what they say, it's location, location, location. Yeah, it's really not that good. The brachial artery flexes in her bicep. In the morning, we'll send her for the horses and the carriage, and perhaps it's time we turn in. I pound mine. Molly, are we bunking up? Before we turn in turn in, it's just Molly and I in our room, right? Can I confide in you for something? I'm a little unnerved about this sword. Would you stay and watch for a second? All right. I'll summon the Wastehunter Falchion. Does the iris move at all, or is it static? Um. Nothing like this. I've never seen anything like this eye before. Only in that dream, where Vander was holding it, pushing it into his chest, but this is smaller. This sword just seems to take in things. I forget what Friends does. Oh okay. Oh nice. Why did I ask? That's an 18. Well, you could've just asked. If anything, it's the latter. There's not a lot I remember about being in the ocean. Right. Maybe, but that's why I asked you to stay in the room. I'm not entirely sure I trust this thing. Maybe. Can I try and focus on the sword? I close my eyes, put both hands on the hilt, and just concentrate on it real hard? (laughter) Oh. That's a ten. Don't take any offense, but no. I make it disappear. Yeah. Me too. I'm just not sure what. Please, I only confided in you because I feel like the strange is your ballpark. Agreed. I appreciate it, Molly. I'll turn in. I'll tell Uma to go collect the cart and horses from the-- Yeah, I'll pay her. We're not going to forge-- Or we just kill them. I'll go down and get it myself. And then I'll kill them. Yeah. Aren't they dead? Just draw some birds. Holy shit. Yeah, it's called "jungle rot." Whose stuff? Yeah. Yasha was surprisingly effective. Did you say "Yeza," Kiri? Northeast to Shadycreek Run. And we're trying to be sly. We want to avoid eyes. Hupperdook it is. Let's get it started. How big do these diamonds have to be, like little suckers? That's a significant diamond. (singing) Traveler take the wheel! We're going to get this fucking bird killed, y'all. I'm just saying. I'll do it. 16. Scat! Are they thick or thin bones? Very impressive. Stop saying it, stop saying the name. He's fucking bored out of his fucking shopping mind. (laughter) He's holding an invisible phone, scrolling social media. Any sweet half-orc around here? Yeah, I'm not much of a shopper. Yeah, it's been without incident, which is what we want. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Nothing we can't overcome. Everything's got its little bumps and growing pains, and I think we've had ours. You and Beau seemed to make up nice. Indeed we are. Yeah, I think so too. He smiles at you. It's a pleasant smile. What did you just say? What's a lychee? NE, Hupperdook. I guess we're going slower than that. Howdy! What news from the road up ahead? No dangers? Clear roads? What do the kids do as they move on? I didn't like his demeanor. Pauly Shore movie. You call that "without issue?" (laughs) Chent? He got a sweater around his neck and mid-thigh khaki shorts? White man's overbite, white man's overbite-- there it is! You went forward and did not retreat? Yes. Four. Hiding in the grass. Caleb, light 'em up. Yep, just swinging wide. On Beau's side. Do we see any visual of the face of whoever is yelling that? 14. Quickly, declare yourselves. You said her name. It's all right. Is that your cart, or did it belong to someone before you? You really can't find a safer line of work? What are you doing with your lives? I think they're freelance, Jester. They work for themselves. You're probably doing him a favor, all right? He'll wake up in the morning. No one will be here. He'll start his life, it'll be a new chapter. It'll be fine. Give her a life of adventure and imminent death. Lay him in the grass. He gets a fresh start in the morning. It'll be fine. Does he have any coin on him at all? Here, I put two gold in his pocket. That's some tiny-ass hooves. Oh my god! Let's travel north, for fuck's sake! Looking for lodging for the evening. We've been on the road for some time. All industry? Where would we be looking for further up the mountain? Any recommendations? Favorite spots? I-i-illiteracy? Not often you find people a fan of illiteracy, but-- Well, we appreciate it. We'll head on up. Are the guards still within earshot? Guests of Ophelia Mardun. 16. That's not our fault. She's very important. I would hate to keep us out of her good graces. I feel like the pull she has in this city should be more than enough to allow us to use the lift. Well, you'll know her name after today. I guarantee you that. I hope you enjoy this post. For the rest of your evening. No, we're not. I don't know. What's your name? Fjord. Just say yes. We're visitors here. Oh. My. God.
