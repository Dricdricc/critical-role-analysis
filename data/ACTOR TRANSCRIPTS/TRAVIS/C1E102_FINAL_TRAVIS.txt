Hide your neighbors, hide your wife. Getting turnt. Are you serious? What song? Is Pass Without a Trace still kicking? Pass Without a Trace. And we've got the smoking thing, right? What's it called, the censer? What is it? Is it called a censer? First try! Oh, no. Should we take off the robes that they had and pop it on some of us? Let's move. Who's got the censer in the front? Because we've got to stay together. There's only three of them. (chanting) Come on, Gil. Eight. I'm sorry. Oh man. Same old same old. Let's just stop by. Old Purvon. We've got a little nuke in our pocket. Is anything stalking us from above while we're moving? Did you hear that? Astute. Yeah, we go in there. Dragging her dolly by one arm. I'll take care of that barricade. I don't know if I can guarantee that. Moving shit out of the way of the door, in a... Let's call it a medium well. 21. Who's laughing now, bitches? Dead body! I birth from the Bag of Holding a dead body. Who's giving the orders around here? Okay. 20. Vex, I bet if you go real fast, you can totally make it. It's blue. We're out in the open. Dismantling that's pretty tough. Yeah, I did. Yeah, shards of blue crystal. It's not pretty, it's all broken. We're all undead, so I'm a little smaller right now, actually. How would we do that? He is looking at each one of us and rolling. Oh, how generous of you. Should we check one of the buildings, and then we can figure out who wants to go check it out, so we can get out of the open? Because he's a cleaner! What's the nearest building? Is there one building that's closest to where we came through the tunnel? Can I walk over? Are there any windows? Does it have a door? Can I knock? Hey, come here! And I grab his face. We just go in. Push in. Shh. Does he have any pouches on him, or anything in his hands? Is the sack on the ground now or is it still over his shoulder? I take the satchel, and I give it to Pike and say look in here. Shall we ask this gentleman some questions? All right. I'm going to remove my hand. Obviously, you're like really cool with the purpose-- perspective of dying, and I'll quicken that if you make a loud noise. Right, like, if you've ever seen, like, Jello mixed with, like apple pudding. That's what I'll do to your head. I did! 22! Grab the scruff of his collar. Well, he's clearly clamming up. I put my hand back over the front of his face, I take the other one, put it on the back of his face, and I start making my fingers touch. Do you want it? Are we? No, he won't. Look away if you want to preserve anything, and I just squish his head. I thought you were me giving the signal like, end it! All right. We'll work on it. Yeah, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Who's going up? Just you two, okay. Do it! And if that fades, he's fully aware that he was dominated, right? Okay. Especially me. Let's ride?! (laughing) Oh my god. 19. Motherfucking Mercer. That intonation. Actually, that's true. Nothing's going to change at this point. Do you still have that Earthquake spell? We couldn't, like, earthquake the tower to the ground. Could we? I just don't know about us going to the top, if we could maybe bring it-- I just don't know how big around it is. It might be fucking huge. That's true, we do. Let's be honest. We really do need a massive shake. I'm not against that, but I think one person should stay out of the Feast and keep an eye in case they leave in the hour that we're feasting. Oh, that too, yeah. I just can't get afraid, that's all I was going to say. That's assuming a lot. Or we just go get it. We just go after it and go get it. Four? Are you scratching your ear or are you raising your hand? Well, let's do it. Well, the transaction upstairs has already happened, whether they get away or not. She just pushes her head against the wall. Shall we go in? Well, you could turn into a... no. It's more than we normally have. I don't know! I don't! Just go get it. It's pretty fucking Hollywood. I kind of like it. I can try and do whatever you want. I can run around and punch a bunch of holes in it, whatever. I'm huge. I have that Cloak of Smashing that Percy gave me. Keep your mouth shut! Just keep your mouth shut! Yep! Sure does! Well, they're not wrong. We're going up to it or waiting till it comes down all the way? Kill everything. Well, I'm done playing, so I'm going to take the Titan Stone Knuckles and smash them together and cast Enlarge on myself. A bib remains. Should've raged. That's not terrible. 24. Circle? Flank? All together? Which one? I would. I will take that ride. Eloquence personified. Platform, whatever you want to call it. Let's also talk about the fact that it's been years since we've been this close to a map. Those ideally go like that above it, right? I'll go right there. The minis look so cool! I know, we've been so far away! Wow! Okay! All right! YOLO, why the fuck not? Oh god, we're in it! No! 20. Shit. Me?! Okay. My dexterity? 15. Okay. The death knight, by the way, is what Colonel Arnold Fuck is. Obviously, we're not at the top of the round. Fuck! Oh fuck, yeah. A natural 19. Oh, Jesus. 19. (nervous laughter) Oh, fuck! Oh man! Oh, shit! Is this charmed or frightened? Okay, it's not. And rage would have no effect on this? Fucking shit. He actually is one. And he won't jump off a 1000-foot cliff. Wow, what a way to lead off the round! Hey, so... (laughs) Looking up! Things are looking up. He has 12 hit points, by the way. Basically worst scenario possible. That's all you had to say worst scenario possible. Remember this look, boys and girls. On Matt's face. As the chef carefully picks the menu of our-- Yes. Come on. Oh my god. Blood pressure's a thing right now. And the Death Knight, right? Oh, shit! Oh! What, you're going to pledge your fealty to the fucking-- Uh-huh. Can I go into a paralyzed rage? 12. I have a modifier of zero, so. Holy shit. You're a beholder, do you get legendary actions and resistances and shit? Yeah, you did a 24, right? 27, yeah. We gotta go! I mean, he's just dunking on us. Crotch in face. Oh, for the wisdom save? Okay. Do you want to move or stay where you are? By one? What're you doing? Which one do you want? Mind bullets! TALIESIN and (laughing) Tenacious D for the rest of this fight, please. If we attack her, is that going to drop the confusion? How about you just say he did, and don't? 7th-level Fireball? We've got to go. Maybe the Raven Queen will use you or something. Are you serious?! Are you serious? On a 7th-level Fireball? Did Delilah take all that damage, too? I thought that was Vecna's go. Oh god. I thought you were complimenting the DM. I was like, yeah, keep it up. Oh my god. Plane Shift? Yeah, I see it. If I throw you over to her, can you Revivify? Do you have to roll for this? Are you serious? Sure. Can I use my-- are we doing this? Can I use my action to pick up my buddy Pike, and I'm going to try and throw her as far as I can towards where Vex's body is laying. There's no difference, right? Versus picking her up and throwing her for an athletics check, or something? You think so? I should just go unload? I would like to rage. Can I use my full speed to head towards Delilah? With my bonus action, can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping to leap horizontally 20 feet? I want to get within melee. That's a million. 25. Yeah. Reckless, great weapon master. Yeah, two attacks. Everything's going wrong. 28? 19. 29. 35, and four because I'm enlarged. 35, total on the first one. And the second one, 19. Should have taken that other thing. That would have been a crit. Minus five. 27? Boy, she's got a high AC, doesn't she? 10, 24, 34, three points of necrotic for 37. That's a d8. That's the wrong one. 36 points of damage. An action surge is a bonus action, right? Should we empty the tank? I'll use the action surge. Reckless, great weapon, all the shit. Goddamn, that was two 19s in a row. If I'd picked that other thing, they would have been criticals. 28. 17, 27, 29. That's a fucking d8 again. 31. 31 points of damage. 27. I'm a monstrous thing. That's a 12, 26, 36, 38, 40, including the enlarged and the necrotic. Don't stop smiling on my account. Did you say claws? 22. Fuck, balls. Hey, y'all, plus one. Don't worry. Four. No! Wait. Y'all aren't in the Shadowfell anymore? Oh, right. Snow's falling. Without a perception check, is anybody around, or is it just me? You know what? I only have one thought. We've got this. This is the worst grin you've ever given us. It's so great. Oh man. What the fuck? If you can bail-- You don't even know where I am. Like a dead Juliet. There are some legendary things that I think might be happening. I love it! There's a god floating in the air. Not a god yet. You did blurt that out. You would be dust. Now. (laughs) Now? I don't want it! I don't like it! Taryon's back in Whitestone having a fucking ball. Look at Matt's face. Don't you do it! We will not go quietly into the night! What is this up and down cardiac arrrest game? It really is a one? It's a d10, right? The fact that he's not a god gives me diarrhea feelings. (laughs) Cool. Right. Pass Without a Trace is still going, right? That's a one. Am I going to do anything? How far away is the nearest structure? I'm going to go into a frenzied rage, and I'm going to use my second wind to heal 1d10 plus my fighter level. Three, six. Six points, yay. I don't have any fighter things, so that's my turn. The death knight. Hit him hard. 50. Huh? Nothing. You'll never mean nothing in this world! Oh! Plate of the Dawnmartyr, you guys. They take 6d6 fire damage. The ones within melee. Let's just have a conversation about this. We're adults. It doesn't even hit! At level five? No, let's stay and fight. Yeah, we're on the material plane. I knew that's what you were waiting for! "I'd rather not use it." That was amazing. That was brutal. We didn't have a fucking chance. Of course! But we didn't know how fucked we were until we got up there. We had to go. And I would have to have won the game all by myself. Or I would have taken the Deck and been like-- Boots no longer. Nope! It's Thursday right now!
