Do you desire a gnome, sire? Bring the king a gnome! Make sure he is of foul mouth and many a song. I assure you, sire, this gnome has many songs, a very tiny instrument, and-- In solidarity. Nothing's changed. Sam, buddy! You made it. You could pour two whole drinks in there, and it would be half an inch of liquid. (laughter) That is amazing. Lock it up! Jeez. We don't even have any weapons. The recap makes it so much better. Just lay it out. What are we doing while this is happening? What was that? How much? Is the power out of the DM's hands for a moment? The last one? That was a big die. Is it begging or is it praying, at this point? Does he have an earring? Jenga! She and I are booking it for the door. I stay at the front door. 17. Seeing how fast she's running, I go into a rage. Yeah! Cremated him! That dick! Seeker Asum is? Yeah, it's a weirdo roll. You can move first, can't you? Raging, I see Vex take off so fast. I try and catch up to her and see what's freaking her out so much. My speed is 50. You're after me. It's okay. I take the Firebrand Warhammer with the Chain of Returning attached to it. I activate it, and I throw it at Lady Delilah. It doesn't have a distance. It has a DC to pull it back. Yeah, the warhammer, but the Chain of Returning doesn't have a distance. Okay. How is it 150/120? That doesn't even make 60 feet, though, does it? If I know how long it is, can I do something else instead of throwing it? If I'd known the distance-- Can I try for Intimidating Presence? There's a DC saving throw-- Yeah. (roars) No! 13. So low! God! Yes. I got little goosebumps from that. Rock. His. Shit. De-cleat this motherfucker. Misses. Hits. Do you still want to be an eagle? Do it! Kill some people? It's not like you don't have 30 dice anyway. So many dice. Does he know friend from foe? Me? I would like to run towards the fucking Lord Sylas. Can I reach him? Throwing range only? Yeah, I'm going to throw the hammer again. 23. 17. Oh, yeah, sorry, d6 of flame damage! Shit. One. I succeed. He's like a dragon! Just her or us? Clap hands. Hits. Do I have advantage on those if I'm raging? 18. Hits. Damn it. Ha! Even better. 21. I do? Yes! That's 24. Awesome. That's 11, plus four points of fire damage, so 15. (yelling) Close the gates! And I walk over and stand behind her. Oh, what do you deal in? And we protect things with tails. Is Seeker Asum still around? Oh jeez, no! Smells like flies. That wasn't my fault. Sorry, headphones. That we know of. I walk up to Vax and I extend my hand, and I say, I'm glad you didn't die. And I reach back, and I backhand him as hard as I can. (laughter) 22. No, it's two. And I say, no one kills you but me. Is that little shitty Mr. Missing One Hand? Tibs and I are in the front, right? Because we both took aggressive postures. Who said I want to be guarded? As close to the enemy as possible. Tiberius and I took the aggressive stance. He said two people are flanking him. 18. My magic, man. That is the Broker. You swallowed it? All right, everybody's doing new stuff. With 50-foot speed, can I get to the far side of the old lady that's sleeping? Can I get like behind her so I can-- I need the laser pointer. Yes. Yeah, on the opposite side of her from where I am. That's what I'd like to do. I take out the Javelin of Lightning. I whisper the command word, which is Penelope, and I throw it in a straight line, which will hit all three of them, in a five-foot-wide line that extends 120 feet. The guy that's standing. Double damage? 4d6. 14. And if he makes a saving throw of a DC 13, it's halved. It takes a little shock, though. What does that do? I don't even have that on here. I have no idea. I look at Tiberius and I go, I did magic! Thank you! Penelope. Did you see the nostril? His little nostril twitch. Do I get to swing? Damn Misty and her steps. That's the best running I've ever seen! The little gait! Will you start running for us again, please? Ageist? Lillith, can I go play t-ball with his head? What, we're letting people live now? Nice job, Kit! (cheering) Yeah! But we got to go.
