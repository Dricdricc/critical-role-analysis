That was good! Really nice. Some good flavor on it. So pretty. Oh my god, oh my god. We get one of those before they disappear, right? They are. They're bitchin'. You spin it, the 20 is the Critical Role logo. They're sick. You can do all your life decisions based off a ring. You go straight to Craven Edge. Going to kill everybody. That's stupid. I have gray-ass dice and a blue one. Plus the underwear you're wearing. Yeah. I took the Floo network. Yeah, made from real Irish cats. Uh-oh, what does that mean? Save us! From ourselves. Should we inspect our spoils? Yeah! Lady Kima don't give a fuck. It's a fucking leprechaun, get it! Kima just left, so-- Corpse armor, hello. Yeah. You know, the thing that almost killed our friend over here? Yeah, but, I mean, you're here, so you didn't die. But you did. But you didn't. But you did. And then you didn't. Yep. Or don't handle it, and we'll take care of it. (mutters) He didn't know that. Well, you died for it, you-- Acid, or necrotic. Well, yeah. Well, what about the necklace? Uh-oh. It might be a worm. Awesome. Well, like, you said "not too big" though, right? Right, right, okay. Please. What are you talking about? Can we take it in the woods, open it up, and if it sucks we kill it, and if not, we've got a new pet. Oh, we will find a way. What do they smell like? (laughing) And birds? Eesh. I require Percy to tell us what the fuck's up with the necklace he's reading about. (laughing) No, no, no. Well, say it, come on. Don't kill anybody. Religion. So, like, even if we let out the glorious Ball-lick or whatever his name is, like, if he's bad, we can't really put him back in, right? What, we touch him with it and he goes back in? Yeah, come on. Come on. Woods! Woods! Woods! No, because then somebody else'll come along and kill it. You got shit in your mouth. Stone giant caves? Shit. Made me feel like I had to poop for a second, there. Goliath caves, fuck. Yeah! Nope. I don't either. I remember I peed on a lake, and then we went under it. What time is it, about? Let's do that first! Nothing yet. So-- what do you want to do? No. I think there's some orc parts in there that've been in for a couple months. Right. I got all nervous when they mentioned a goliath's cave, so I need to go boom-boom. Might help. Like, stand guard outside the door. Would you mind? Can I go drop some ordnance? (coughs, then farts) Oh! Now, the music's playing, right? It's just a stall, just me? All right, can I take out Craven Edge? All right. It's the palace, this is where all the best thoughts and conversations happen! I don't know how it is at your house. Yeah! You might want to play a bit louder and maybe take a few steps away, it's about to get violent. Yep. Yeah, I did, right? I mean, we are really doing well. Question so, when we were fighting that big Earthbreaker Groot-looking guy, he called you a 'dark weapon'. Does that-- do you have feelings, and did that hurt them? Right, hold on! No, no, listen. And I take my thumb and I run it against the blade real quick. Right, yep, sorry, listen. So, my question is, as much as I love opening up people to feed you, I want to know, like-- what's in it for you? Yeah, no, you got to let it know who's boss! No, no, no, I'm a big fan, really, I mean, I am yoked out when I'm using you, it's fucking amazing. I mean, people are flying apart, it's like a dream. But listen, can you ever be... full? I'll bet I am, actually, you're really lucky you found me and not these other blokes, not even half the man I am. But listen, so, there's no, like, endgame, just to be clear, you just want to drink and drink, 'cause I've seen the blood, right? And usually I wipe it off, but you, like, suck it in, and that's a little unsettling, not going to lie. (farts) Right, yeah, right. Not even a problem. Well, look, I like the way you cut people open, so we'll continue this another time. And I sheathe him. I kick the door open, and I'm like, if you're within 200 feet, back up! Oh. Yeah. Yeah, no, am I sweating? It was a real workout, that one. Yeah, the privy, you know, it was starting to give my bum a tickle. Yeah. Yeah. Because, you know, you don't want to, like, dip in the muck, it's, you know-- Did you want to-- Are you sure? I warmed it up for you, it's, like, ready to go. All right. Fair enough. But I'm feeling so, like, vacated-- I think you're right! (laughing) Okay. Absolutely not. Oh please, oh please! Oh, yeah. I understand, take-- Take all the time you need. Look at the air, look at the air high-five. There it is. SAM, TALIESIN and So white. That was the whitest of white high fives ever. What? No, it's you, I mean, you're so magnificent in it-- I don't know it-- I really-- Hey, all right, I'll pick it up. He's good. I lose my strength bonuses. Oh shit, you got the armor now? Nice. Oh, you need all the help you can get. Yes! Christmas morning! Who has that, by the way? Oh! Yeah! Where d'you keep it? Where's Percy? Yeah, we got potions, we're fine. It's probably, like, a big Saint Bernard. What's the big deal? Where's Percy? Oh! Shit, you were quiet. Hello. Need any coffee? An enema? And we go outside with the necklace. The woods! What about sirens? Wait, what are those things called? The things that took our horses the last time we were here? Yeah, yeah, whatever. How's it look? Sweet! Let's go! Up to the cave! Fortress or cave? Yeah. Small space. Yeah. Cave. So is it like, cave-fortress, are they same level? I can't remember. Yeah, let's go to this fortress, then we got more room to move in case it does suck. Wait hold on, hold on hold on! Oh yeah, we should, what do you call it, spread out? I don't mind stepping out, but I would like to be able to see. Is there a doorway in the fortress? Can I stand in that, then? Vax, is this g-- Vax? (laughing) Oh, holy shit! Never could've been better. Told you it was a dog. Can somebody check to see if it's actually a wolf or just looks like one? Like, check it? Keyleth, can't you talk to, like, plants and shit? Speed change. Quick change. Shitballs! Taint! You going that way? Well, I'm in the doorway. I pivot on my back foot. I take out Craven Edge-- No, I do, I take out Craven Edge and I sink it into the earth right beside his head. And I say, (shouts) heel! 20. Stay. That went well! (laughter) Good pup. No, no, I don't think it has a master. This is a very powerful beast. But it needs a firm hand. And I think it needs a job. So. What do we plan to do with Galdric? Said his name right? I reach into the Bag of Holding and I pull out one thing of dry food rations, and a probably pretty rotten chunk of dark elf brain. Oh, there's a veritable Walmart of shit in this bag. (laughter) Does it have a little bit of a viscous-y ooze, mostly? It'll soften up the dry food. So I throw that on the ground, and I pour a little ale on top of it. (laughter) Yeah, no, it wasn't the best, I can do better. Okay. He's going to barf that all over the carpet later. I need to carry beef in this bitch. Oh! That's really good to know. I offer him some ale, just to see if he even likes it. Some dogs like beer, some others don't. Yeah, all right. Then I chug it. All right. That's a great thing to throw at a giant 400-pound bull mastiff. Right, so we're walking back to town. We've got a giant fuck-off wolf with us. Vax looks like Edward Scissorhands. What? Yeah. Do we find a holding pen for the wolf? He'll mount you. Let's be clear. (laughter) With the troll. It was so good. That was you, wasn't it? Who was getting humped on? Keyleth, repeat after me. In exchange for food, protect these lands. I didn't say that shit. I didn't say that. He's a wolf. He doesn't need those. (quietly) Holy shit. No, no. A great danger approaches. You'll know it when it comes. I walk over and put my hand over Keyleth's mouth. You stay. We feed you. Is there a tavern or a butcher shop or something nearby? That was the dumbest thing I've ever heard. (laughter) Me. A willing creature need not make a saving throw. Yeah, you got to teach him to quit rummaging, that is really foul. Got a carrot on your chin. I can't remember where, what-- Thank you. I'm having terrible hiccups. What's close to here? (hiccups) Well, we should definitely go to the Fire Ashari. I have this black iron plate that I haven't used ever. 'While wearing this heavy plate 'armor, the bearer gains resistance to any fire damage.' All right, here's what I'm thinking, right? I mean, if we go after my herd, we're in for a fight. A big one. If we go to your Fire Ashari, we're doing recon and hopefully learning something, right? Are those bad? You really want to get the rest of the testicles of-- Allura or that bearded dude. Well, if there are survivors, they might not be that way for very long if we don't go. Wait, hold on, is there like a house of entertainment in Whitestone? I know it's just getting back on its feet but you know. Percy? I'm having a bit of a soul struggle and I'm wondering if I might bend your ear for a moment. Yeah, could I speak to you over here? Right, so, like, I want to get my freak on. Yeah, no, I, I'm sorry. That was very unclear. So I know this is like your home and stuff and you might not have been aware of it, but they have these houses where like.... Yes. Oh good, do you think they're still in order? Could you point me in that direction? Oh yeah, me too, important things. I was thinking for Scanlan in case he gets bored, you know, you've got to keep him focused. Oh, okay, well, I'll let Scanlan know. Just keep it between you and me 'cause he's very sensitive about these things. Well, my, my, indifference Yep. Okay. I'm going to rest. It's either that or we go goliath hunting. Yeah, right, let's just check it off. Necessary. Pick one. Sure. Say one, just say one. Seriously. Man, it's hard being a druid. She's not here. Damn! Almost broke. Did the ground cool where they were walking? Could we follow them up? You don't want to put him in the thing? 17. Plus ten. I rolled shitty. Yeah. Well, let's go. And we go. No, that's only wisdom. 17. Way to announce it. (laughs) You're fucked. Levels of exhaustion suck. From who? From what? Well, I really don't even know what I'm going to do here. Okay. Well, good. I'll take a mulligan on this one. Okay. We're cooking with gas now. Where we take shits and talk to swords. Guys, I'm a human. Usually. 12, 1230.
