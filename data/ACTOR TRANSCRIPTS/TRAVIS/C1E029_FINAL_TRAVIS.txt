Keep fighting! Yay, little snitch. Has that ever been done? (singing) Diamonds are Scanlan's best friend. I think you smashed it. Meanwhile, Percy's unconscious. G'day sir. Yeah, you never get arrested or anything, you're good. Should I try peeing on it? Maybe they're not below the tree, maybe it's just the soil. That's some door! We could hang him in the tree. Just say the word. Do we check the mansions for him? Hello. I'd like to share the news of our Lord and Savior my axe in your face! 14. What does that mean? Damn! Skittles, motherfucker! And not a donkey. Man, that was a good night's sleep. Who do we get to kill today? How many mansions are there? Right. One, three. I like it. Seconded. But I've been peeing in the corner. What? Look, it's like they did in the old days, they had chamberpots. I mean, I have my corner. It's my recreation corner. Sorry. Yeah, that's my brand. Yeah, we're fully exposed. Do you want to head in one of the directions of the mansions? Oh. That's actually a good one. Are you feeling all right? Scanlan, go knock on that door. The Lady's Chamber? All right, but I thought we were killing somebody in this house. No. We walk south. We leave. South it is. Do we get to kill her? Like a vitamin? (laughs) He can make you feel real good. Wow, that's harsh. Looks cold. I always wanted to be a lord. Me? Somewhere between one and 50. Low key. I take the Dust of Tracelessness to void out any footprints in the mud. Oh. Not my normal flower girl routine; maybe it's like the old Shawshank Prison walk. (laughter) Yeah. Would it be worthwhile to maybe say that the little boy and the old lady were caught hoarding crops and we brought them to this guy, see if we can draw him out of his house? Yeah. Okay. Once around? Four. Do we want to try to draw them out or get to the cellar? Either way, those two thug guards are going to die. What's the fence made out of? Is it the spear-y shit? It is poky. So, I could throw Scanlan over. How do we sneak in past them? I'd be down for that. Sure. Can I try and Lou Ferrigno those bars? I don't have any gloves. I rolled a 23. It's all right. Hey, back to full! We gotta make it across the lawn first. 23. I have Darkvision. Wait. Rogues are whatever. Just to be clear-- Before we start we're killing everything, right? Okay, good. Do we want to send one person out sneaky and then have a code word like Cheeto if it all goes wrong? Did we do that before? It's fine! We could just set a fire down here. All right. Invisible or not? Dead people, that's who. It's opening night and I'm so excited! (laughter) 29! Do you have any of your rings on? Turn them inside and (impact noise). I rage. Advantage on initiative because I have that thing. I have Feral Instinct. Which I forget sometimes. That's better. SAM and 20! I hear him say that he has to die last, and in my rage, I race forward to that fuck in the middle of the room and I swing my Firebrand Warhammer at him twice! I would make to make this first one a new feat called Great Weapon Master. I'm going to use my-- no, not on that one. That misses. A two! So that's 11. Yeah, that misses. That makes me even angrier. And now I'll use inspiration. 18... minus five, 23! Okay. Plus eight is 13, 17, 27! Plus four for the fire damage, but still the 27 total. That's the best thing you could have ever done. Yep. (screams) 26. Minus five is 21. Yeah. 21. 32. You dropped your toothpicks. Yes! (singing) Cold as ice! Nobody knows what you're doing. (laughter) Adding to the confusion. Keyleth, Vax. Two rapiers? (grunts) Ow! (grunts) Ow?! Oh! Double what? The golden snitch strikes again! His clavicles sticking out of his shoulders. Get that clavicle; be working. Kerrion. I keep smashing shithead that's in front of me! That's 24. These are just regular. Oh, I should roll the other one first. Again, 24. Regular rage. 23 on the first one. And 12 on the second. Yes. That's it. The guy I've been smacking. Mr. Filch? Yeah, he's a squib! He knows this. He's making origami. With the Missy Elliot step, I don't get an attack? What the fuck?! Amazing! How?! God! I don't get it! On that wall, it's soldier being eaten by Keyleth, and then invisible. The one that Keyleth's attacking. It's also including invisible guys. That's good; at least he (electricity noise) around some. To the books again! I thought he was coming for me. What?! What the hell?! Whatever, you possessed Voldemort. (laughing) Smoke arm. He said that weird. Is this the name on one of the barrels? That's some cold shit! Percy's having all the fun. And I start smashing that fuck that's looking at Vax. Might as well make these great weapon master strikes, just for fucking why not. That's a 15. Yeah, that's awesome. And the second one-- Yeah, that's pretty good. 28 minus five. 23. Okay. 15. 20 is the first one, with the fire damage. Oh! Yeah, 30 is the first one. Plus 10. And 13, 16, 26 for the second one. Great weapon master. "Kill yourself." Yeah, because we should kill the more powerful guy. Uh-oh. I want it said that this one should die. He has magic. He's too strong. They could set better traps. I start tying up unconscious guy on the floor. No, I know. I thought we wanted to interrogate-- The balding guy. We tie him up, he shoves a rag in his mouth, I put one hand on the top of his head and the other hand under his chin. Should we bring him back just a little so we can ask him some questions? Yeah. What? We're asking questions. We got to bring him back, just a little bit. We're on Vouk. Before we knock him out, should you make sure that whatever he tells people is truly fearsome? But not too descript about us? That everything was fine. Are you standing next to him? The rag's in his throat. You are going to listen very carefully as my friends ask you some questions. You'll shake your head yes or shake it no. Should we take the rag out? I nod his head yes. I just give a little squeeze. Yeah. I'm going to turn your head into a dreidel. I start to tilt his head and I'm like showing us won't work, we need a location. I take his head and I shove his nose and his face right above the map. And I say use your nose. That means we don't need you anymore. He'll set a good trap. It's all over the room. His tongue? I stick my two fingers inside of his nose, crank back on his nose, reach in, and rip his tongue out of his mouth. You said take his tongue! That's a natural 20. Is that good enough for your message? I'm good with that. I've got this. No. I like that a lot. Have we forgotten that this entire town is full of evil, undead vampire people? We've got the guy painted all over this room. They're going to find out one way or the other. Might as well do it with a little showmanship. Come on, be the Mockingjay, Keyleth! It is! I do like ripping. We're not fucking vampires. Look, what are our options besides burning the house down? I'm open to other ideas. And where do we stay? The tavern? Do we have to find another building? I take the tongue-less one, and I throw him out. I keep him bound. He's bound amongst the chest and hands. And I throw him out the window. Bye, motherfucker! He'll get up. His feet are free. His legs and feet are free. I'm picturing chest and arms. Sure. Do I kill him first? We might as well leave him out on the front step, or something. I'll grab Sir Kerrion-- Yeah. I'll grab unconscious guard and the body. There you go! I throw unconscious guy and Sir Dead. What? Hi, Trinket. Get out. What? Okay! 21. Okay, yeah, just throwing it down behind us. Shit got hairy. It's October.
