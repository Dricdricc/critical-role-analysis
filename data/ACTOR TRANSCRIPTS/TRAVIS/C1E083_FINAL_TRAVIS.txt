Oh my god. Jugs or Not. February 17th through the 19th. Or whatever the dates say. What? They're really nice, man. There'll be Grog socks with just tons of holes in them. Made by me. Not as cool. They're going to smell like balsamic vinaigrette or something. April 29th. I play a viking. Okay, all right, okay. Jeez. No one can hear it, man. It doesn't exist. Yeah, it's been a while. That's a good thing. Just do it again. Here we go. Hi! Hey! Not as great. What is it? Plus? Plus? Cool. 13. Let's be honest, she fucking knows we're here. 13. I think we should just leave. (all laugh) Somebody should roll off to the left. Pike swore. She's the Deceiver. Percy and Grog are going to roll off to the left. Cool. To the left? Why a stealth check? I'm over there. (all laugh) Stay behind me. Somebody do something. I would also, on the other side, like to advance as far as I can without reaching her eyeline. What are we doing? Please do not sing that song. 16. So Keyleth got the lowest? You got the lowest one? MARISHA AND Yeah, I was writing it down. With my inability to write. The eggs have't taken a turn yet. (trailer voice) This Easter, the eggs have not taken a turn. Taliesin. Benedict. (nerdy voice) It's time for an Action Surge. That wasn't so bad. Really? Just the sound? Blow one note. I rage and-- I would like to rage. With my 50 feet of speed, can I try to make it to Thordak's corpse? See how far I get? Okay, cool. Can I take-- I found out that the hammer, the dwarven thrower, is a versatile weapon. With two hands, can I take a shot at his big stupid cranium? Okay. I want to squash the watermelon. Oh, reckless. Oh. Okay. Come on, crit on the dead skull-- natural 20! It's like a beached whale. I talk to the new dwarven thrower-hammer. "This is the beginning of a beautiful relationship!" Well played. I have another hit, but I want to get close enough for it. With my bonus action, can I use the Boots of Feral Leaping to make a horizontal leap 20 feet towards the remaining egg? Oh, they're all toast. I want to leap. I'm focused on the egg, all right? I leap toward the eggs. 20 feet. And I have to make a DC 16 athletics check. 18. If I touch down, may I throw the dwarven hammer at baby egg corpse? Reckless. Yes! Do it again! No, not quite. 24. (all laugh) But this is just a d8 because it's one-handed, right? 21-- I think it's just if it's a giant it's a 2d8. Yeah, you're right. Ranged attack. So that's 26 total. Yeah! Start the morning right. Come back from that, bitches! No? We're not worried about that? I'm good. Those aren't even there at all. Don't do it. Listen, I like you the way you are. Don't-- Oh yeah, that's a fucking five. Please don't. Look, come on. In my previous relationship, I've been burned before. Okay? I want to start fresh. (shrieks) I scream like I'm in a haunted house. (all laugh) I jump like a bitch. The Boots of Feral Leaping are nothing, y'all. Oh, that hits. Both hit. Necrotic, huh? I'm going to Forrest Gump up this bitch. Real quick. 42. 41, 21 and 20. Is this a saving throw or just a constitution-- Minus two to everything, right? That is a three minus two equals one. Is an 11. That's me. This guy. Total Kerr-bear. Dammit. (singing) My boyfriend's back and you're going to be in trouble. Somebody's cat at home just died. That was awful. Oh yeah, this is her wheelhouse. What was it? Crusader's Mantle? Yeah! Oh, that's good. I replied in a positive way because I didn't know any better. Page out of Gilmore's book. (Pike voice) Yeah! Taliesin literally has the laser pointer. Glitterbomb, yeah. Going country! Pretty sure. Don't you want to see how much damage-- Help me! Yeah! Didn't your Hunter's Mark just disappear because she wasn't there? Just hits, or hits? She was at 24 last time. 34. 43. 18. (heavy breathing) She got that Hep C, y'all. (all laugh) I think it's 23. Here's all of them. The most random line-fillers. The air conditioning? Nobody can counter that or anything, hey? Oh, nice. Well, yeah, yes. She started to cast. Allura, wasn't she preparing Disintegrate? And it goes ting-ting-ting (explosion). 11. Now, is it-- do I halve the bludgeoning because of raging? That's the single most powerful attack we've ever had hit, right? You might as well go out with the ace, man. That had some stank on it. Yeah, get rid of that one now. No! Not McGruff! He is smoked. How's it going? (barking, explosion) Earl Grey. Yeah. Second one is still there, right? High five? High five me, bro? That was like some six-week-old orange juice. Yeah, dude. Yeah! Commitment. Was it cocked? (singing) Stay alive... Throw the laser pointer over here. Laser pointer! Blind him. Blind him! Take the shot! Yeah, it ain't good. What's the effect of the armor? I take out the cask of ale and I start drinking. (all laugh) Yeah, right there. 50 feet, and I'll leap the rest, just to get up to the-- Yeah. And that is-- 22. Oh, I can throw! Oh, this'll go well. Nope. That is a 16. Awesome. Well, I'll make 'em Reckless, so I'll zero them out. Can I throw the dwarven thrower? Okay. One roll. 21. That's better. 31. 18 points of damage. Oh, thrown. 20. I would like to go into a Frenzied Rage. 28. No, no, 28 to hit on the third throw. 22 points of damage. Yeah, it does. Not that shit again, I didn't do well on that last time. (nervous laughter) No no no. How much? Cool. Seven. Grab that popcorn, this movie's interesting. At least people can't smell it. (said extremely quickly) Don't you get advantage on those death saving throws? (auctioneer's babble) Shit. No! Fuck! I could do it. It's a five. Who's got the This Is A Bad Dream spell? Oh, sorry. (Impressed noises.) Who's that? It's a fountain. It's because of that saving throw. (laughing) Is this my urine or someone else's? Good, flee, do it again! Where are you? Can you point to him on the map? Yeah, I'm right there too. Yeah. Uh. Dragon moved. Scanlan dead. (raspberry) Did I detect which direction el dragon flew in? Yeah. Sure. Three. I am just going to throw a hammer in that direction. In there. Yup. Can I make it reckless? One roll? Does that zero out the disadvantage? Okay. Right. 27. Nice. That's good. Yeah, can I keep track of where it hit her-- 23. 23 damage. Can I be thrilled that I hit something that I didn't see and smash the Titanstone Knuckles together to enlarge? Can I try and throw the hammer again? At the same general area. One roll. Unless I know where she is now, but I doubt that. That's a one, so I'm, no. I thought I couldn't see her, so it was disadvantage, reckless advantage, so just a single-- That's better. 31. Okay. 18... 26... plus four for enlarged... 25. 25 damage. Yeah, yeah, I'm freaking out right now. 25, I think. Yes, it is. Oh, right. Yeah, I'm going to move in the direction that she flew. Ah! I get angry again. Not a word. Not a word. (Nervous laughing.) Two legendary actions. Minus two, because, yeah. But advantage. 17. Halved, halved. Six. I know. Hit him! Her! Kill all the other dice. What? Did that really happen? Did that work? Oh my god, she fell, she fell off. Still got a dragon. Still got a dragon. You killed one of our gnomes! Wow. Come on, come on. You fell off a bench! Leave the Mario way. (Mario sound effects) The Dragonslayer, right? You aristocratic bastard. Total of 32. So like, retaliated against it? You tried to kill her, yeah. Here we go. (clears throat) Jenga? Yeah! Grog would like to get up. What does that take for me to do that? Half my movement. Can I use the rest of my movement to run towards dragon-dick? Yeah. Can I use the boots of feral leaping to leap even further. Okay. Natural 20 on that one. Yeah, on my leaping. (all laugh) I leap through her chest. Boom! Yeah. So I have my three attacks, yes? Imma have to throw 'em. Reckless, not negated because I can see her now. Right. 30. Okay. 23 for the first one. The second one I'll make reckless and great weapon master. Okay. No, I can't do great weapon master because it's one-handed. Right. Jesus. 24. 23 for the second one. Piece of shit for the third one. Wait, where's-- 23. Third attack. 27. 26 for the third one. No, the last one I rolled a one on the damage, I reroll ones or twos with that first thing of fighter? Yeah, I don't remember what the number was, anyway. Thank you. She dies suddenly. A cardiac arrest. Oh my god! Alive. Wh-where's Scanlan? Do you want Matt to do this, so that there's no-- Wait, how many times has he died? Taliesin, how many times have you died? Are we all here, then? I take off running for Vax. No. No. No! Fix him! FIX HIM! Well, somebody do something. Well, we got all these people with magic, you've all got magic spells, you just brought him back. Fix him! I mean, what do we need? Do we need, like-- Why did he roll? Fuck. We have to get out of here. Oh, there is? Yeah. Fuck that shit. Titanstone Knuckles. I'm going through the door. With advantage. That's good. 26. Sure. Kerr? Can you smash glyphs? Of Fireballs, or--? Is it all four of them? Do they regenerate? They just grow back? Like, we shattered two of 'em. Fuck. Yeah, how do we go? Why, what's there? We need something that'll get Scanlan. What's the quickest-- Is at Greyskull Keep, or-- Oh, right. Yeah, do it, do it. Yeah. No. No. No. What do you mean, it doesn't look like that normally? What did that mean? We need those two, right, to do what we need to do. We have to go with them. You'd better be right. If we leave those two behind. Do we need them? Go find a tree. We all start running. Yeah, yeah, now. Vax and I are still walking. One thing at a time. Still moving towards the beach, looking for live trees. Shut the fuck up. We're on the beach. No, no time for that. I'm waiting outside the temple because I probably can't go in. Right? I can't go in there. I don't know. I'm just me. How do I do that? What, I just start talking to him? Oh, in there. I'm not really religious, though, like. I don't-- Right. Okay. For Scanlan, then. And I go into the temple of the Raven Queen. I hear him! I hear him from beyond! Well, you didn't do a very good job of it, Patrick.
