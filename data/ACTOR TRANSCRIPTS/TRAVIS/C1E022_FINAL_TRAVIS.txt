Love you. For my birthday, I got this. This is really great and heavy. Matt got a cloak. I hold out my arms for Vax. Everybody else is getting a fucking hug. Yeah! And I just squeeze him in, rub him amongst my breasts. Oh, for fuck's sake. Did she say brand? He's not wrong. I put Percy in front of me. Yeah, what is the order? Who's anxious? You seem jazzed. I'm the caboose! I don't think the caboose makes sense now! Yeah, we're on board. We return the bow. I return the bow. It's a fucking lion with wings! You saw Harry Potter, the hippogriff will jack you up! Bow back! What?! You didn't check for the bits? Good thing we didn't try to lie. Yeah, sure. Scanlan is the Cinemax of this group. About that money, you said you owed us some? All right. Are we free to go? You guys! We killed a dragon. A what? Wait, what's it called? He had a tiger head? There's some messed-up shit out here. Pretended. You did what? Really? Yeah, Scanlan took a little beating as well, didn't you, Scanlan? (gasps) Tell them I'll be along shortly for therapy. Did any of you take a beating, or was it just us? I like dwarves. Did he have an axe? Having a bad day? Planted one what? Like a tree? Are you blushing? Do you have a crush on Cashew? Did you guys get anything I should put in the Bag of Holding? Any cool trinkets and bits? Oh, we always have ale! I pull out the cask and I pass around a little. I'm sorry, you said it went in the acid? It looks fine. I'm sorry, it doesn't fry anymore? You got a kiss! I didn't get a kiss. What the fuck just happened? How did you do that? Your ways are mysterious. Like holy shit, did you walk around going like, "Oh, holy shit!" Should we visit the shop and get some potions? She had a tail. Moonbeam staff. She had horns. And teeth. Merkin. LAURA and It's a brand that we got from a giant sphincter. Sphinx? Boom-boom. Right. About that. I thought we were going to get it re-enchanted. You have been working in a temple. Roll one at a time. Should we go get some potions so we can heal up? What time is it, did we say? No beard check. I can't. It's not a new day. It's a new day! 96. (gasps) That's going in her Sarenrae. You watch it, motherfucker. Your supply of what? Oh. Yeah, they're all over the fucking place. Does Vesh have a lot of followers? I don't like that face. Can I look around the street and see if there are any shady types lurking about. What'd you call me? What were you saying? No, wait, you said you have oddities. Go on, then. Like what? I think we have two. Funny thing. I like to work out a lot, and I like to go lift boulders in the forest sometimes, so would you have anything that might give me a temporary increase to my already magnificent strength? Like the dude in the beginning of Aladdin? Come close. Oh, too close! A little too close. (laughter) I like the scars that my damage situations leave behind. I'm not quite as interested in that. What else have you got? Come on, pull a Vex. Get that number down. Ironschlager. Because they'd put a lot of iron in it. That's true. A thousand? That's just above, like, four? How much? Not that I'm not a man of incredible wealth. Would you be interested in anything besides coin? Well, I have this fancy bag myself. I happen to have parts of an umber hulk. Pieces of dragon, if you might be interested in that. I also have jewels and fancy robes, if you need a change. Right. I have an orc head. And I reach into the Bag of Holding and pull out the orc head. Oh, that's actually plus one for persuasion. 13. Yeah, we do. We have 14 dragon teeth. You're not there. Four cups of blood. It's probably more like a gel right now. Several pounds of scales, and maybe a few claws. I'd have to look; there's so many. How about-- All of the dragon's teeth and three of the vials of blood? Done. Vex will be so proud of me. (laughter) Stone Giant Strength. Thank you. Can I find that in here? One hour, so my strength becomes 23. Give it a little number? Does that change my modifier at all? When it goes up that much? Cool. That's the part everybody wants. Look what I got. Let's go join the others. As she walks up, I grab Vex and I go, you will be so proud. I just haggled down this guy so well. Why? Why would you Hunter's Mark him? We are in the middle of a city where people might not take unwarranted aggression well. So anyway, I was working with him, and you always try and get more for our money, (haltingly) and I definitely got more for our-- more-- gave more money-- Oh, I gave him tiny bits of dragon for this amazing flask of Stone Giant Strength. Yeah, Percy got a vial of Greater Healing. To the tavern? TALIESIN and Yeah, it's just waiting for us. I mean, we're basically the richest people ever. Oh, excuse me! Oh, can we have a goblet of your strongest stank for this one? How much are they? Should've let me haggle that down. I would have got it to 19 gold. I thought he was going to the house where they-- Yeah, Never-Been-Kissed. How's that sound? Nope. Not me. So you're pretty anxious to go, then, yeah? But you know about where they are, right? Are we hoofing it? Are we flying? Whoa! The holy symbol goes (shattering sound). Not if you know how to handle them. I walk up behind Vex and I tap on her opposite shoulder and pull my hand away. Yeah, one more! ASHLEY and Come on, you son of a bitch. Yes! Two, two! 22! (singing) I feel so happy. So happy! Is it like an Abe Lincoln beard, or do I also have a mustache? Don't judge. What are dragonites? I missed Pike. I like him. Can I put my finger in the cage? I put my finger in the cage and go, hello, Lockheed! He's a real peach. Son of a bitch! I have some dry food rations if you want to give him a nibble. There's fire. You'll win them over. Royal stuff. That's true. Should we ask how far it is? One of you wordsmiths go talk to somebody and ask directions. What's your girlfriend's name? I need a new horse, because mine's back, the horse-- So probably a new horse. He's all like this. Come on, this is your thing. Come on. It's verified. That's a 20. Would you be interested in negotiating? Right. 200 gold. You could take the busted-up horse. It just can't carry me anymore. And then if we get-- if we get just outside of the-- I'll wait. Do we want to push on, or do we want to rest? We should push on. We're all right. Okay. Make camp. I'll take the first watch. Can I trace back a hundred yards and Dust of Tracelessness it, from where we came? She went back to the 30s. LAURA and Mourning getting negotiated so hard. If I have the first watch, I have darkvision, and I take out my Firebrand Warhammer as I begin my watch. No, no fire. We have two more pieces of broken-up armor and a lantern. And manacles. Welcome! At night or in the morning? I pick up Keyleth, I give her a big squeeze. Oh, thank you. Oh, sorry. I drop her. Be a zero or a one. She has to hit 11 or under. We roll that right now? Just for the day, right? I ain't afraid of no ghosts (snoring) Fuck! No! No. It was just so calm that once the sun came up, I heard you-- I fell asleep. Sorry! Zero... zero! Aw, I thought it was like the lowest roll you could ever do. Shit. They call me Honest Grog. Like Lincoln? No? Zero, zero! Hundred. Is that an Ashari song? Keyleth, we're all here behind you. You've got this. Wait, is that Kashaw? Made you look. Break the tension! Never mind, you've got it. Eight. 18. Your clanging armor didn't do nothing! 21. She didn't have disadvantage. She rolled a 17 on her constitution. A mighty two. You know you don't have to breathe all of it in every time. Should we hurry? What do you think? Because I know the mountains, are we still on that crappy narrow precipice? Could I look and see if there are any boulder, avalanche-type situations that I can see-- There's going to be art for that. Lifting boulders? We could just bolt. We're at the bottom of the valley. 13. As much as I like being targets for their lawn bowling, we are in the bottom of a fucking valley. In Giant I call back, fuck you! I don't know if it is a giant. It had two heads. Oh my god! I take the warhammer, activate it and run up towards the walls and swing as hard as I can into one of the walls. (strained wince) 19. Yeah, I do. From Pike, anytime. LAURA and We all back up. A vision of your death? We're with you to the end. What. We're behind you. 17. The feast thing? No? 20. Well, it's shiny. Oh my god, they're on fire. We have walls! I rolled a one. She has immunity. 16. Burning? Like a cattle auctioneer. (imitates auctioneer) Badass. Our pores look better than they ever have. I look over, and I see as Vax starts slashing into the fire beastie, I know this is going to hurt, and I go into a rage. And I know I'm going to burn, but I take my three giant swings with my battleaxe. Frenzied rage. Frenzied rage, if you don't mind. 24. 19. And 24. 11. 19. And 12. Was that a crit? LAURA and Oh, shut up! Don't tell him that! The beard is okay, right? Oh, come on, man. Have you no mercy? 18. Do I get advantage on that because I'm raging? Yeah, with the being on fire, it's really not that bad. On the smaller one? Just take the two. Fair. 20. That's worse. 14. Can I move around the backside of him without him getting an attack of opportunity if I stay just as close as I am now? No? Son of a bitch! Just because I'm cooking-- fuck it, I'll keep swinging. I'm in a frenzied rage. That's a 20. Oh no, a total of 20. 19. And a 22. 11. 17. And a 19. It's because we're family. That'll hit. Misses. Oh, I don't know if that hits or not. 13. Can I use my stone's endurance? Okay. Shit. No, I'm okay. I got back 19 points. Okay, good. Can I use a hit dice to heal myself at all? Six. Everybody gets 33 points. Yeah, Keyleth! Yeah. You think they have graham crackers and little bits of chocolate with marshmallow? Your people are fucking sweet. (laughter) Well, that's good. I don't think we could take another one right now, anyway. Yeah, please. Yeah, you've done so much for our lives. Maybe you continue to do good in these lives? You can leave them anytime, and we'll kick their ass so you can come back. Just keep the poo close. MARISHA and Tatonka, yeah! We'll see you soon. Maybe we'll wait until something is negated. Fuck that place. They don't sell any timeshares there, I gather. The two twins and the handsome one.
