We play Dungeons & Dragons! It's expected now. How do you make the letter F with your hands? Nope! What about dramatic prairie dog? Nice! That's so cool. (as Grog) I couldn't help it, I'm sorry! Ooh! You have, that's right! Yeah, four pages of notes, I think you got it. Should we go back down and just push the button, just make sure that we're wiped out once and for all? I'm kidding. We should make our way over to the Bisaft Isle, right? Need repairs? That would be the thing to do. Yeah, how's everybody feeling, by the way? Are we damaged, beat up? We all right? I'd estimate probably three or four. Believe! You hear that? Holy shit, I got it right! As I was saying. Orly, if you would, please plot us a course to the Bisaft Isle. Bisaft. No H, it's Bisaft! Can you do that up in the crow's nest, please? Yeah, which on D&D Beyond-- Why would you be anywhere else? Can you uncanny dodge a shitty dex roll? We have a fucking stowaway. Caleb! Jester! Beau! Everybody, below decks! Find out what that was! That you, Nott? What did you do? I'm glad you survived. There's a lot of gunpowder down there! Nott! What is coming out of your mouth right now? Y'all have daily prayers? That's a lot of heat. Yeah, right? You heard that; it was like (gibberish) Fjord (gibberish). Are you sure there are no more booby traps below? Can you go back down there? Take Beau, Jester with you, and we will stay up here to make sure they don't get by you on the way out, but you need to find whomever or whatever that was and isolate it. Yeah. Exactly. No, she didn't. She was in shackles next to the ogre, right? But! Isolate and contain, go now! Apologies. Growth. (singing) Character arc! Oh good, a little Naruto run? Who the fuck are you, though? Oh no! Holy shit! Does she still have chocolate all over her face? Real perceptive, rogue. What is that? Is that mud on her face? Chocolate. Twiggy. You can call me Fjord. That's not necessary. Sure. Captain Fjord works. This is Caleb. Yasha walks over, and bends over at the hips, and puts her eyes right in front of Twiggy. I like her. She walks away. Sure. Yeah, I can tell. That's my emotion. Fair enough. How old is she? Aren't you worried that her parents are wondering where she is, or her family? We're in the middle of the ocean, Jester. I'm actually from Port Damali. Well, howdy there. What a coincidence. This is so crazy. Are you trying to get anywhere in particular? I understand that. Wow, okay. Wow. Were you by yourself, Twiggy? There's no one else we have to worry about pissing in the corner of the boat, do we? Who's Trixie? Who are you talking to? A rodent? What the fuck is that? Goddamn chinchilla? What is it? I don't trust squirrels; they're tree rats. You just keep it to yourself. Jester, can I put you in charge of keeping an eye on Twiggy? Twiggy, we're going to the Bisaft-- what is it? Bisaft Isle. I don't know if you're familiar with that area. We need some repairs, and then hopefully you can find your way from there. Caduceus, could you make sure that she gets some real food? Interest intensifies! That is heavily disarming. It's like the worst controller you've ever picked up at your friend's house. You're like, oh. Chocolate and Cheetos and all sorts of shit. 15, eight, four. Well, I think we'll take her to the island and then, obviously, give her a chance to continue her adventure. Well, now, Jester, look, I loved Kiri as much as the next person. So much, just, mm. Yeah, so great. But I also don't want to be responsible for anyone that can't take care of themselves. She made a what? Are we forgetting to describe things that are of import on this ship? She did what? I wanted to see a Caleb laugh so bad. Oh my god! Like some horrible crash. Okay, so she's not entirely invalid. What? That's right. Jester, you would not want guilt over bringing in sweet Twiggy here to what could be certain doom. That's what we do; we seek out certain doom. Yeah. Tell the truth, now. Well, you said you got that nice little sphere there; anything else we should know about, maybe? Fun ball of tricks, yes. I will not forget again. Anything else we should know about that people might wish they had instead of you? Caduceus had it last. Oh, great. Jester, I'm going to leave you in charge of Twiggy, all right? We've got to make for this island. You keep an eye on her. I don't want to see any chocolate thumbprints in my quarters, you understand, Twiggy? Okay. All right, you're in charge. Yeah, of course. Feel free to lend a hand. No, you're not the only one. I don't trust that shit. That saccharine? Yeah, you need some salt to balance that shit out. What's a pomeranian? Maybe we throw her overboard. When you were down there with her, did she try any shady shit? Right. Okay. Yes? Apparently. Yes. Yes, I will. Are you up for it? Lot of responsibility. You've got to, like, co-sign for the boat and shit. Shake on it? All right, first mate. Ah! Fucking Cobalt grip. It's all right, I'm kind of immune now. I just take it. I feel so special. (burbling) That's my call. (burbling) Forward deck. We need to change it to the Balleater as quickly as possible. Nott, I need you to hang over the side of the ship with a paintbrush-- -- inches above the water and change the name of the ship to the Balleater. Can you do it? On who? I thought it was on me! I was like, (yelps). You're a temporary pirate now. It's a great honor; don't mess it up. What were you saying? Yeah, I was going to say we probably took stock of any colors we have that we can run up that aren't associated with the Squalleater. We still have some fire damage on the boat, though? We're going to play that. Our flag was burned. Get the fuck out of here. What? That's so old. Is it only 800? I thought it was 8,000. Oh no! Your hands? I'll be showing Beau the ropes, first-manning the ship. Oh my god. Shit, I totally fucking forgot about that. The first time we got on the boat. I don't think we were here. No. That's a kill shot. Oh, that's right! Oh, shit. Upgrade! Instant death. Kiss of death. It's just black? Yeah, I'll come running down. Yeah, what is it? You don't have to announce it when you show up. Don't yell your superiority. We'll get you a shirt or something. Rope? I got 100 feet of rope. Put your hand in there. I'm reach down and put the tip of my finger in the hole. Just feels cool. (yells) Like a person-sized hole? Oh. My goodness. You must have proved yourself greatly. We vote on the name every couple of months, but it's going to be a while. Well, she needs a hat. Every pirate needs a hat. Same size? I'm sure it'll be fine. I think so, too, but you've got to do it quick because it's going to stop real quick. Do it, do it! Yeah, it's been about twice, a minute each time. Jester and Beau, boulder-parchment-shears. Figure out who's going to put their head in and help us see it. I'll grab onto her britches as she's doing it. Down to her feet. Do I look the same? Start speaking in Latin. There's a watermark up here. I can see it. It's amazing! Oh, I don't believe, Matt! I don't believe it! We've got to figure out what all this stuff is, first. I mean, just so it's not a pole and a pair of shitty boots. With that symbol on the back. Have any of us heard that name before? Archibald, or-- Beau, when you hit that buffer, did it feel hard and solid, or was it soft and earthen? Did you find a portal into somebody's wardrobe? Well, at least it's the same place each time, so if it does close off, we at least know how to find you. You're going in. Yeah, you're really good at finding stuff. When she was yelling on the other side of the portal, was there any sound that came between the two? Between the portal? Nothing? Or if you're ready to come back, tug twice on the rope. Really? You're so brave! You're full of shit, aren't you? As a note, the previous function of the sphere, we can access? Or is it one function at a time as it changes? How'd you escape? It sounds real familiar. I have a plus ten! Green light's never good. And they never come back. How many times did you mess with it? Like six. What's it do? What's it do? (explosion) All four symbols are the same on all four banners? Not in the middle, Matthew! (singing) I want to be by the corpses. Let it build. As Caleb flies backward, I'll summon the falchion and take a defensive stance. Did the burst that came from the blue make it all the way across the room to the green? It just detonated on the other tapestry? In the haversack, right? I'll do it. Yeah. Who are the locals? Oh! Yeah, forgot you can do that. Which one? The one closest to you. Yeah, ditto that shit. Yes! Thank you, Taliesin! No, I'm trying to put it on. Does it fit? I'm fucking fit, okay? That is an excellent way to try and figure out what the fuck's going on in here. An observation deck. You know, it's just a thought, but if we have to open two of these that are facing each other at the same time so they destroy each other, we'll probably have to drop that down. We'll get there. I like it. What about sound? That is really resourceful. Where did her gum come from? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, me too. Do it. You don't need that hand, you got another one. Ooh, shit. Red doors are bad. Proceed. Why? Can I search the pockets of the red coat? Seven. No pockets! Well, we haven't pulled the black curtain back yet. Yeah, we're fine. Well, we're not going anywhere in here. Who wants to come with? Jester, Nott, y'all okay? They just turn on you that fast. Okay. Yeah, I'll follow Twiggy. Thanks, Jester. That was well used, my man. As we turn around and look at the door that we came back through, are there any markings above the door or around it? 20! No. 19. Twiggy, 50 feet behind everyone else. I'll go after Jester. (vomiting) (laughter) 21. I'm not looking at your notes, I'm just looking through the wall. Caleb passes out. You say the stained glass window was on which wall? Gotcha. Thank you. I'll climb up the ladder and get just under the stained glass window. Can I see through the glass or at the glass or is it above me? You and your damn loft positions, Taliesin. What's that? Ah! Ah! Okay then. 15. Yeah! A small ruby circle? Does it blink, shine, shimmer, move? Confused by its location, I'm gonna touch it. Yep. Because I do stupid shit! Why does he got to describe it and make it sound so interesting? What about me, Matt? I'm going to do it! 19. You're not going to whale on this cabinet, bro? May be Taliesin's. I love it when the DM describes something as too realistic. Would the cabinet have a French accent when it talked? I have been here for so long. (whispering) Probably not important. (as Fjord) What's your name? (as Grog) What's your name?! What a fucking bunch of idiots we are! It's so good. And then there were three. Just the two next to that one. Oh shit. Natural one. (high-pitched) I'm okay. I'm a fucking sailor; I'm okay. I miss Grog! I apologize. (laughter) If you would simply point towards the exit, I would be most obliged. Can I be entirely honest with you? I have recently been putting my hands where they don't belong. This time it sent me to you. Probably to look and not touch. Well, you know I do have a very salty variety myself. I'll summon the falchion in my hand. Now listen, I don't want to disturb you any further. I'm just going to see myself out stage left over here. You have a nice day and enjoy your vast fortune. I'll start to walk towards that left tunnel. Where'd you get that impression? Natural one! Yeah, small tears. That's funny, I've actually heard that name before, Halas. We saw some of his belongings. Before you devour me like a tiny little shrimp, would you mind a small request in letting me know who that person was? I am charismatic. (squealing) 23! Natural 19. Cool when there are six others, seven others. (panicked mumbling) An arrangement, you and he? How does he send you these, I assume, incredible gifts? I don't want to bring up a touchy subject, but I feel like your friend might be dead. Manor? Are we in a house? Jeez. You know, I hate to leave you without a friend. I mean, if this guy's up and left you high and dry, maybe I could offer my services. 14. I was trying to draw that shit out-- You have no idea how happy I am to see you. Dragon! Damn it. Ooh! I started to take a step to the left while facing the dragon. Did he? 16. Why do warlocks only have two fucking spell slots right now? I'm going to focus on the dragon because my friends are here and I'm going to cast Blink. It is not. And with my bonus action, I will set Hexblade's Curse on that blue dragon. All right. No. Blink was my action. Oh, I do. I roll. Yep. That is 11. Just hope it listens to what you say. It lights up this place for you big time. Fifty-fucking-five?! (screaming) Oh, Matthew! I'm sorry I touched the window! Boom! Ah! 17 misses? Get me the fuck out of here. We're level seven. Why did we do this? Yeah! That was a good gamble! We're all bouncing! The monk's like, "Really?!" Ten feet closer to the end of the hallway. I will use all 30 feet of my movement to head toward the end to see what the fuck's down here. Did I learn anything? I don't know what to do. I'll turn around and I'll fire two Eldritch Blasts at the dragon. I hope that'll fucking hit. That is a 24? Great. Second one is 23. Oh great, that's 16 points of Eldritch Blast. And 12 points of Eldritch. No, you don't! You do! Four! Shit! (screams) What's that? I did. Yeah, the plus three to each time. They were manly screams! You got it! So good. Nott and Caleb. I'm down here now going (screaming). It burned up around it and didn't do anything? God, what do I do? Cast Armor of Agathys on myself and smash my head into the crystal? It's cold damage. I'm going to cast Armor of Agathys on myself at 4th level. (laughter) (laughing) I smash my head into the crystal. Can I use my movement now to run up towards the tunnel where Caduceus is in the direction that the light moved? If I roll less than an 11 on Blink, does the spell end or is it every turn? Okay, great. Well, apparently I am fucking terrified. I shit my pants and I can't Blink. "Hope it's home." Yeah, assume 55 points'll miss. It's just a dragon and a fire elemental. Yeah, take your time. That is my armor class. Okay. That's reduced by-- Oh. How much-- That makes it simple. Is it looking rough? Real rough? Pieces of his ribs showing through? But look how cute she is. You're going to what? I take 1d10 fire damage, right? Okay. I will use my movement to-- where the fuck am I? To run towards the pedestal. Actually, I'm sorry. Let's come this way, to Jester. (repeatedly) Uh-huh. Let me take back half that movement and I'll go here. I'm going to-- I can't bail on Jester. I'm going to fire two Eldritch Blasts at the dragon, trying to get its attention. 25 and a 22. Seven points of Eldritch Blast. Ten. So 17 total. 21. Do I have to roll blink if I don't-- But I think, doesn't it take an action or I can just choose? It says, "you can dismiss this spell as an action." Bye! (groaning) Come on. When you come back, remember it's ten feet from where-- "It's looking hurt." Oh yeah, there's nobody in there! It's bad! (laughter) Oh, fuck. Walks out of the wall. Oh, you fucking crazy goth genius! Yes you do! I pop back into existence ten feet. I want to stay out of his melee. Yeah, and I'll use my extra language to go Yeah, it's bad. Grab the sphere! I'll use my full movement to run towards the sphere. If it will put me in his melee-- will it? I will use my bonus action Misty Step with the sword to (poof) over to the globe. I will reach out and touch someone. Okay. It's the worst playroom ever. And you can choose. Mercy kill. We are best friends. My heart rate is literally like I've been running two miles. Get the fuck out. You've done enough. You did enough! Don't do it! Oh my god. You had one after the 18? Please tell me the dragon can't touch the sphere. The intro's been up one week. The animation takes a long time! Who's hurting real bad? No, nobody-- What are the rules of drinking hard liquor on Twitch? Nott, you took that with 19 hit points? Yeah, roll that shit, Caduceus. Where are we? Marius, do me a favor. Just tell us how much repairs cost and let's all settle in for the night. We're going to-- Still on fire. We're going to need it. Yeah. 130 gone. How many? MATT and Well, let's just call that lesson learned, yeah? Maybe we should all reconnoiter in the morning. The good news is is that if Twiggy actually killed the dragon-- which you obviously did-- We can go back. Yeah, it sounded bad when it came out. As an honorary member of The Mighty Nein, just do us a favor and make sure you tell your story far and wide, yeah? Make good life choices! She's leaving us, it's the best life choice. Yep? Right. I'd say something about that that doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but I feel pretty fucking weak right now. That was a dragon. That little crazy Ball o' Fun is a troublemaker. Just like Twiggy. Maybe we just leave that particular function alone for a while and collect some gold to recoup our repair costs. Oh shit. Yeah, if a big, blue finger comes through the hole, we'll know Twiggy lied. I'm going to go get rid of this concussion now. All right, first mate, you got the con. (groans) Yeah, that's awesome.
