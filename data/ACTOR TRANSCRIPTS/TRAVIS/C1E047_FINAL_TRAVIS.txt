Never forget. Don't make it weird, man. Aw, sad Affleck. It's actually tomorrow. Tomorrow at midnight is the deadline. You smart son of a bitches. It's so simple. Tomorrow at midnight. Oh my god. Oh my god. Holy shit. Yes, 630 today, it went up. I really like these ones. That's what these pre-show announcements are, is trailers for those that are late to the stream, they don't miss anything. But, see, Batman vs. Superman, no trailers. Scared the shit out of me. You can't do that to somebody. That's half of the joy of going to the movies. What are all the tents and houses made of, anyway? (scoffs) Whatever. Is that another name for your penis? Yeah, I want a house from your balls and bits. Mushroom-stamp the land, let's go. It's a door. We should send somebody ahead first to check. Vax, are you up to the bit? I come inside and I see the ethereal things, I'm like, ghosts! And I take Craven Edge and I swing at the ethereal sumbitch! No, the ghosts in your house! What? Thank god I'm here. Hey, you there, you, ghostie, do you have any ale in this establishment? Bring your most expensive frosty glass of ale. You shouldn't be Burt Reynolds, you should be Hugh Hefner from now on. Really? Oh my god. It's Graceland! I'm waiting on my beer. A game within a game. The Inception (bass note). Holy shit. I put my hand up for a high-five. It does? Wait, these servants will do whatever you want to do? This is going to be the best night ever. It's about to get Caligula up in this bitch. How many times can you do this? Shit, yeah. Wait, wait, wait, so if we were in a fight and things went really south-- Can you make fart sounds with your armpits? Yeah, I'll go down there and I'll stay with Trinket. Yeah, I want to train a little, want to work out a bit. Yep. I need a target, though. Hey, can you call one of those little ghostly guys over? Yeah, right, fine. The first one of you that brings me a cow wins. It's like a bunch of Mr. Meeseeks with cows. Do I get to pick a cow? There's just one cow? Right. So can I touch the cow on the head? We're not killing anything! And I punch the cow in the nose. No, look, I'm just seeing what it is. Stay, Bessie. What, I'm just seeing if it bled. Did the nose bleed? I punch it again. I took a really easy punch. No, I'm not. Is there any blood? Never mind. You know what, I changed my mind, I don't need a cow. I'm going to go stay in a normal room. All right. I punched it so hard it exploded. Yeah. You want to train with me? All right. Always a good time to get better, I guess. Rope climbs. Wizard of the Day? What are you doing? That was awesome. But this is where you train. I thought we were going to train. I thought we were going to fight. I feel like there's a problem with this idea, but I'm not sure what it is, so I do it. Look, I know I usually hit back, but apparently your mum thinks you can cannonball into me, so give it a go. Oh, fuck. Yes! Yeah, that hits. (laughing) Okay. 26. That was pretty good! I liked it a lot! I think this might be a good look for me. How do I get it to stay? I start climbing all over the walls. Is one of your servants named Broom? Rotisserie chicken! Do you usually yell when you clean? What was that for? No, I know, but I like to make her feel good about it. Ow! I look at Trinket and wink. Yeah, what are you doing? You didn't clean very much. All right. I'm good for the night. I wanted that cow. Eating food. Should've come to me for that. Yes, totally! I rest. Sleeping in the sand pit. Like a beach, just (snore). (laughs triumphantly) You swallowed that last part. What did you say? Why is that bad? We commandeered it. I don't care. I don't think you wanted to do that either. Are you going to re-gift it? Sweet! Yeah, shoot me with an arrow! Oh, Jesus! How many was that? Just one, right? We've been here for five minutes. It is pretty sweet, flying around like that. (burps) Yeah. Where? No. We haven't gotten those yet. But there's other things to explore. Yep. Yeah. Oh, no, I mean. Whenever. It's. You know. You want to go to the library? You know, they roam. Yeah. Was it? What? They wander there. Yep. But look, I was thinking. It might be a thing when we find them, right? So picture this. Me, and then a lot of other me's, and they're all really big and angry. So if we want to do anything else before that happens-- Yeah, and I'm a super cool, awesome, fun guy, but we didn't really leave in the best terms. Ass-kicked, yeah. All left for dead, pretty much. Right, so I was a bit younger, and we were wandering through the woods, and we came upon this little old bearded thing, right? And he was carrying groceries, like food and stuff, and everybody was a little hammered from boozing, and they were like, hey, let's kill the little thing, and we'll string him up and see what his insides look like! And normally I'm like, yay, I'll wear him as a hat! But he looked really sweet, and I felt bad, so I said we shouldn't do that. And... They didn't like that answer. My uncle in particular, he didn't like that, so he made me fight my cousin, his son. That wasn't bad, I handled that. It was not a problem. No, there's no grudge. They pretty much think I'm dead, because after I whooped his son's ass, he whooped my ass. Yeah. I'm not hiding from my herd. I was, was I? No, I'm excited to go. I want to go. We should go. You know, what we need is the wolf. Yeah. We need-- Yeah. Don't they smell shit? He could help us find them. I mean, if you want to. I don't know how long it's been since he's seen a she-wolf, so, you know. I mean, it's very generous. Yep. What's a number bigger than five? Yeah, it's like six. Yeah, six. That's closer, yeah. It's been a long time. I mean, they're pretty smart, they're like me. Here's the thing, though. Normally, if you try and steal something, or if you try and break the rules and you're like Keyleth and you get arrested every time, arrested ain't so bad. They don't really arrest you. They, like, open you up and use you as an appetizer. Yeah. That was my thing, though. So I'm a little nervous about that. Yep. Odessa? Osysa. Shit, that's what I would call her. Odessa. It was Pike's grandfather, yeah. And plus, she's a healer. All right. Fuck. Look, if there's a lot of them, and only a handful of us, it's not usually customary to have two sides go at each other. If we want those Knuckles, I'm pretty sure it might have to be one on one. Now, I know I can totally take my uncle. But I wouldn't mind if we found a few extra-credit items before we did that just in case I have the flu that morning, or it burns when I pee. Just something to take the edge off. If that's what you want to do, then yeah! Grog does not kiss and tell. All the time. Yeah, I mean, I hope we do. Or we go where? We could set an ambush later. A what? 14. Do we keep going, or do we-- Somebody make a choice. Down or keep going? Just you two, right? You three? Wow, we're just going to make this super obvious, huh? There are dragons flying overhead. Yeah, we've landed. Let's do it. We all want to die. Fuck it. Let's do it. I'm changing. Hey, 18! 28. Is he close to us? I go (clicks). Shh! Help me out. Shh. Shh! Keep picking! Do you know where they keep them? Look. Say we were really bored, and we wanted to get you your family back. Where would you go? Oh, fuck me. Fuck, fuck, fuck! Damn it. Shit hammer. No, wait, wait. We've got to go get his kid. You said there are a lot of people that look like me. They're in the city? We need that guard. We're going to ask him some questions. I just want the guard. No, there's two. There's two. Fucking nipple tassels! Is he holding anything? Yep. I love it. I love it. We're going to ask him questions, and if he makes a peep-- Hold on, before we do that. Can you see the other guard that was out here? It's like Kansas, right, it's flat? What distance would you put him at? How far away would you put him? 100 yards? Do it. Do it. When he comes over, I grab him. Nobody do anything that's loud. Yeah, I promise. I run over and I tackle him, knock him to the ground, put my hand over his mouth, punch him in the forehead. Punch him again. Punch him a third time. And I barely lift my hand. Punch him again. (sing-song) Horace. (muffled) Fucking hell. I'm going to move my hand. If you make a sound, wash, rinse, repeat, yeah? Nod. Shut the fuck up. You're looking big. Yeah, right. Funny thing about me. So look, who else is out in this field with you right now? Yeah, no I want back in, for sure. That's what I've come here for to come back in. But here's the thing. It's a bit of a surprise, right? Other people haven't seen me. You like a good surprise, right, Horace? Yeah. I thought you might. Here's my question have you seen my cousin Zanror? Is he in the city? Right. And what about Kevdak? Right, listen. I was going to pounce on this poor farmer over here, but I saw you were obviously keeping your eye on him. Why are you doing that? Yeah. Old Broken Foot over here. Really? Gold? This poor farmer? Have you? Oh, like wishbone? Yeah, that does sound like a good idea. Here's my thing. Why are you guys in this city? It's not really our thing to be in civilized places. No, I don't think I will, Horace. Jesus. Really? Kevdak did? Well, it sounds really good. I do. I've actually brought a few gifts. I unsheathe Craven Edge. Isn't it. And I ask out loud, are you hungry? I pull it back. I stick the point in between his ribcage, and I drive it up through him. (shocked noises) Oh, more? Pity that, acid reflux. What? Nothing. It takes in the strength of who it slays. Did it do that? What? I don't know. I remember him. He was always a little shit. Who? Horace? Sure. Yeah, he was going to go tell about us. What? So listen, right? Either we stay and do some recon, or we take out the other guy that's walking back to the city. Really shouldn't be a problem. But if they're all in there, 50 strong, I don't think we're quite ready for that. The sneaky fucks in our group could go take a look, if you're feeling randy. Info only. Yeah, but that's because we did it as a group. How far are we from the city here? Five-minute walk. That's not far. That guard? I know I did. Just imagine what we'll do to the rest of them. I don't mind you taking a look, but be careful. It feels kind of cheap. I don't know. Yeah, but can't we use our eyes? Just as they are. Do we have to turn to smoke this time? It feels a little cowardly. Yeah, that's fine. You can turn into a cloud, and float in there, and see what you want to see, but I'm not turning into mist when my herd is inside that city. If I go in, I'm going in. Yeah. Thank you. Reginald, you want some ale? No, I do, yeah, hold on. Get the cask out, pour him a cup. Pace yourself, son, there's a lot that's here. Wow. Another? I'll keep them coming. Scanlan and I have been alone. Right, so I turn to Scanlan. And I say you and I are mates, right? Right. Could I confide something in you? (clears throat) Right. Well, I'm full of surprises. One of which is-- so, I had this horrible dream recently, and in the dream, I was killing all these people with this amazing sword that I have. But there were a lot of people, and some of the people that got killed I knew. And I feel it has something to do with this sword that I have. And the secret is I can hear the sword talking to me. Yeah, look, so I'm telling you because you and I have such a history, right? And I feel like you won't judge me, but, like, I'm afraid the rest of the group won't quite understand. I don't know if I'm crazy or if this sword is talking to me. No, I just hear a voice and I was wondering if maybe I take it out-- No, only when I'm holding it. So, like, I could take it out now and we could see maybe if you hear it. So I take out Craven Edge. Craven Edge. How did you enjoy your snack? Are you getting that?! You're not hearing anything? No, like, super sexy (low-pitched growl) voice? Nothing? No, it's not worth it. Look, do you want to hold the sword? I hold the blade, and I hand the hilt towards Scanlan. (grunts) See, now, now, now, Craven, I'm starting to feel like I'm doubting myself. I'm seeing things-- he's talking to me. I'm going to take it right back, I just want him to experience your glory. Shit. Fuck. That's bad. (gulp) Seven. (pained) No. On second thought, don't worry about it. It's clearly-- and I take it back-- it's not, it's just-- maybe I just need to see someone or talk to somebody. Clearly, I mean, you don't-- it's talking, you don't hear it, right? No, it's really heavy, too. And I sheathe it. Three! (laughing) Giant modifier on this one. 16. With a modifier of zero. You know what? That's a great idea! I feel like you should hold this sword. And I hold on to the blade, but I still hand the hilt to him. 18. 19. Yeah, plus one. Ask it a question! Yeah! And it'll talk right back, it's like that! Is it saying something? No?! It's not saying anything?! What? (laughing) Why are you pointing it at Reggie? Yeah! I take it back. It talked to you, then, yeah? Right, it's creepy as shit. (confused sputtering) Now, hold on! I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't fucking, you know, batshit crazy, which I'm not! And I'm really glad that we're sharing in this now. But hey! Hey! Don't tell anyone. Promise me. No, that's why I brought you in! You're all smart, right? And I always want to ask questions like, what's the first thing it remembers, what was it doing with Lord Briarwood--? No! You must be a dark wizard. No! It just says it's hungry. You heard it that time! Holy shit! I feel like Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams and you're James Earl Jones! I've got a friend in this now! (laughing) Right, so, look, you know. Yeah! Right! Yeah. It could be good; there's nothing wrong with being hungry. I would never! Never! No, yeah there's never even, like-- Yeah, totes. Yep! The Eiffel Tower! Yep! All right! What did-- Yeah, boring here. Yep. No action. A lot of goliaths? That's what I'd do. Right. Trying to be scary? Agreed. As far as this city goes, correct me if I'm wrong, but we have two options. Either we stealth in with the stealthy people, not me included, and we try and pickpocket Kevdak for the Knuckles. Or I challenge Kevdak for the Knuckles. Yeah, Cole was heading back to the city, though. They won't care about a hostage. Maybe. Not that hard, though. So my fear is this that if it's anyone but me and him, everyone gets involved. Not just us, but all 60 of them in that stronghold. I don't think we walk out of that very well. I'm not opposed to facing him head-on and seeing what fate has in store for me while you free any prisoners that might be around, or ransacking his house for any fun bits, but I think he's going to have the Knuckles on him. No. I would need to think about it. Regardless, I think now is not the time. Perhaps we go look for Osysa's mate. He seems pretty fortified. And we don't have Pike. And this is her hometown. Well, yeah, speaking from a selfish position, if I fall, you can really do whatever the fuck you want. I think honor is bupkis at that point. So I don't mind what you do after that. No, no, no. That's very sweet. Uh. Emotion. I would like it if Pike was here. They're not nomadic any more. Yeah, they ain't going anywhere. Yeah. Let's just do this. Let's go after Osysa's mate. If we don't learn or find anything incredibly valuable, we're at the same place we are now. And then we can kick the tires. It's too big for Grog. Could have. But it's where Pike and her family raised Grog. Her schedule's so busy, but if we can get her next week... We do.
