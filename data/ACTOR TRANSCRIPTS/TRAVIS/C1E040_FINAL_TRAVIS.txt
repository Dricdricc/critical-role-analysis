Damn it! Damn it! It was perfect. Ashley Johnson. Pike is amazing. Come out and say hi! Get those out of the way now. It's getting amazing reviews. Plus you are handing out D&D to young kids, getting them started and hooked at a young age. They got like cookies and a little coffee thing. It was pretty dope. What else can we do to put off dying by four ancient dragons? Are we all here? Is anyone hurt? We're all hurt a little bit. I'm all right. Short rest? Outside of the keep? Yeah, we got to get down. You want to go first? I guess I was out in the courtyard, trying to help the cattle come in. The door to get back inside is located where? Nine. Three! He said 'yeah', you can go ahead. What the fuck. Come on, golden snitch. Get the hell out of here. At least you hit it, you got to bleed it a bit. Longshot. Yeah. I don't even know what 3/4 cover bonus is. Never happens to me. I'm usually a 3/4 cover bonus. What about all the spires that are up there, that have anti-dragon poison? Oh no. How high above us is it? 25. I would like to rage. And run at Trinket. He's covered in how much ice? I would like to run to the side that is closest to you, on Trinket. I would like to start pushing him along the lawn, towards the entrance to the Keep, like a giant ice block. Okay. Yes, thank god. 18. Yeah. On the floor. Come on, go nuts. Mid-range potion? Just barely hits or hits? It lands? 18. I can't be charmed or frightened. In the middle of white death. Oh fuck, shit. Come on, taint-smear. Tickles, both of them. Where you at, Pike? Are we really fighting this thing or are we running? We are getting our fucking asses handed to us. He keeps saying ancient. So it's ancient. You can run away from it. We've got to run, right? I think it's stupid if we stay. I don't know where, can he get inside the keep? Yeah. Is he good? I have advantage on those. Because of Danger Sense. Natural 20! (cheering) I get an attack of opportunity on it, right? 22. Does that hit? Okay. This is with Craven Edge, five, six. 19 points of damage. You fucking piece of shit. Fuck this dragon. As much as I would love to protect this house, we've got to get the fuck out of here. Is Pike right behind me? Can I grab her and run inside the keep? No, no, no, I can't do it? 50 feet? Little meat sticks, it's not a problem. I'll even damage them, I don't give a shit. Get out of the way, giant beast coming through. The dragon giggles. Don't say it smug like that. Jeez. It's our lives! Yep, got to go. Got to go. Got to go. Nope. Pee. (laughter) Yeah, we all go inside. Percy. Can I have a word with you, please? May I come in? Can you shut the door? Can you lock it? Listen, the skull we took out of the house. I haven't told you, but it grants a wish and only those that dark things have touched can use it. That's you and that's me, as far as I know. It said it wanted you, but I wasn't going to let him have you. It grants a wish. We can change all of this. I feel like it was there in case the dragons came out of that portal. It was facing the inside of the room, it moves, and there's something in there. I feel like it's a weapon. What the fuck else are we going to do? We go for more help, it'll get killed coming into this city. We're not strong enough to take four of these fucks. I'm listening. They have to be touched. But who? Keyleth, she's bleached whiter than Whitestone. I step closer to Percy. I think you only need me. Name one other. All right. I leave. Fire and ice sale. As I was leaving, can I notice anything about the back of his door? Like is-- a lock or is it flat, plain? 13. Minus two, you asshole. (laughter) I bet I can figure the lock from the inside. And I open the door and it opens because it's unlocked. I go up and I try and find Vax. Sorry to break up an awkward moment, Vax, do you have a moment? May I speak to you alone? No offense, Vex. You and I may have had some friction recently, and we have our differences, but we're on the same side. Percy needs you downstairs. Will you come with me? I would tell you, but I don't want to frighten anyone in this room. It's about the-- (quieter) It's about the skull and I can only bring one. Percy's request. I have to come with you. I go back downstairs. What? Why? I'm sure this is going to go dandy. 19! (laughs) I don't know why I'm so excited right now. Everything's dead. From any direction? Or just attached? I look about. Is there anything looking at me? Anybody throw anything at me? Pour anything on me? This keep is fucking drafty. I go downstairs. Five minutes, five minutes. Before we go in, I would like to put my hand on Vax. Just a note, I tried to do this by myself, but the skull asked for Percy. I know he didn't respond well with all that dark shadowy stuff, so be careful. I'm not entirely sure we can trust him with it. I wanted to do it myself, but it was either you or Keyleth, and you're a prick, so I picked you. I go and shut the door. What are you talking about? If it wants to be set free, fuck him, it's a wish. It's like a genie that wants out of a can, you don't grant it its wish, you get your fucking wish first. Hold on, hold on, hold on, look, we have a chance to do good now, right now. People are dying. More people are dying. I don't understand. Are you a betting man, Percival? If I told you that four giant ancient fuck-off death dragons were attacking the city and all of us barely managed to break one of its pinky toes, you're saying what's in there is worse than them? What the fuck was that? Can you do magic? (sighs) Fucking pussy. We have a chance to save this city now. Can I walk up to the shadow table? Can I start looking around it? Do I see anything? I did not reach, I'm looking on top of it, on the sides, underneath. No button, no latches, no holes for quarters? Study. Who did? (laughter) Who's in the room right now? I shut the door. I want that skull. I want it now. Yeah. Percy's trying to do some fucked-up shit with the skull. I did. No, but I can stand in front of it. I want the skull, right now. No, you don't want to see the sword. No, I don't think so, your water fucked me up last time. You get it out of the table. Which friend? Vex. Okay. Trust? Vex, listen to me. What did you see? (sighs) The skull grants a wish. It can only be used by those with dark presence around them. That's Percy, that's me. How has Percy done with dark shit in the past? I went to him for help because I'm trying to free the city of these fucking dragons, but it wanted Percy. I tried to keep it for myself. And now he's up to his shady shit all over again. It wanted Percy. The hell you did. Cool, I'll stay right where I am. I weigh like 600 pounds. No, you already said it. Vex. If he has the skull, we've got to get it from him now. That's a great idea. Yeah. Give her the skull. 17. Just a fuck-- just a minute! Give me the skull, you don't want Percy to have it. If you want to, you can ask it what it wants, and then you'll know, or you can give it to me and we can be done with this. I bum rush Vex. I bum rush Vex. 14. Ugh, Jesus. 28?! 14. The head? The skull? She's 50/50 distance between us. He doesn't seem to care much. I want Percy. I'm going to tackle Percy. I am going to run straight towards Percy and tackle him. I'm trying to fix the dragons. Why can't that be higher? 19. So Vex still has it? But I knocked him off of her. But you've still got the skull. Yeah, I would like to turn and put my back to Vex, because she has the skull. Me? Yeah, yes, fuck, it's me. We don't, we don't, we just don't want him to have Percy. Is it dusty in there now? Or is it just windy? Do we have an order? What are you trying to know? I want to get rid of the dragons, now. Oh, oh, the flames, ah! (laughter) Why? I look at Pike. I turn around, I look at Vex. You'll thank me. And I'd like to try and pull the skull out of her hands. 21. What would I like to do with it? Can I spike it? I would like to spike the skull. What are the fucking chances?! I don't believe it. I don't fucking believe it. Stop trying to protect the skull. Don't do this. Natural 20. These fucking sensations today. We're not fighting, they're trying to protect the skull. A statue garden? No, I want to break the skull. I want to get rid of the dragons It needed someone with a dark touch. But now it's-- To get the wish, but now it's touching everyone, they're trying to protect the skull, and we don't want that. We want it broken, I think. Yeah, we want the wish, we can do whatever we want to with the wish and not take it, but yeah. Well, it didn't say anything about a payment. There are four dragons killing everything. Allura. What's he wielding? A stick. Does she know about the-- D--? Fucked! And a big red piece of shit. No, it was Keyleth's Ashari thing. Sitting on Emon. It's weird, they do what he says. It happened very quickly. Oh fuck. The whole world. Allies. Vasselheim has warriors, armories. Can I roll hit dice? Yeah. Wow. Can we play longer? Yeah. Originally this was supposed to be a three-hour show, but it never quite made it that way. The was fucking awesome.That was awesome, aside from the death. All right, okay. Nah, we all would have been kings and queens, we would be drinking iced mochas. I would have saved the world, that's what would have happened. Fucking one. I would have been King Grog, I would have gotten a cave, I would had a bunch of harem people taking care of me, giving me sponge baths with their tongues. I would object to that. They're all dead, everybody's dead. I love misusing vernacular. Great fucking story Matt, holy shit. Holy shit, you had trees and stuff. It works. The green was amazing.
