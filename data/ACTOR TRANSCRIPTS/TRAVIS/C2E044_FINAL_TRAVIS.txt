Matt's going to decide it. 000155.480 --> 000156.619 Much love Backblaze. 000251.452 --> 000255.723 (Pumat Sol voice) Take advantage. I made a-- 000407.942 --> 000411.600 I think I let down Matt. 000413.249 --> 000414.213 That's right. Oh god, I know! At least I'm not the only one that's going to get butchered. 000621.746 --> 000625.032 Yeah, next Tuesday, December 11th at 4pm-- 000625.032 --> 000627.100 Yeah, no. Totally. We're the anti-Twitch streamers. There's really good people like Ninja 000633.483 --> 000640.041 and then there's us. Every yin has a yang, right? So Foster and I, next Tuesday the 11th, we're 000640.041 --> 000644.419 going to play some Black Ops as part of our recent fundraising campaign for Operation Supply Drop! It 000644.419 --> 000648.359 will be live at twitch.tv/criticalrole. 000648.359 --> 000650.173 We probably won't suck too much. We'll have moments of brilliance followed by lots of swearing. 000654.906 --> 000656.185 It's been months. 000656.969 --> 000657.596 Many months because of baby. 000659.007 --> 000659.906 And in the in between moments that I do have Red Dead. Sorry Black Ops, but I got to get 000702.952 --> 000705.115 back in there and practice. 000705.115 --> 000707.432 (laughter) 000707.432 --> 000708.262 Yeah we did. For over five months, Sam and I worked with some extremely talented animators in 000928.236 --> 000936.384 the Philippines. We have to give massive props and love to Kamille and Kevin Areopagita. They are 000936.384 --> 000944.765 absolutely brilliant. You can check out their twitter page at @karekareo. Their patreon is 000944.765 --> 000951.081 there. Go. Give them both love. Support their patreon. They are far too talented to not be doing 000951.081 --> 000956.887 more. We were so lucky to work with them on this. They were absolutely amazing. Every little bit of 000956.887 --> 001001.672 creative input we gave them, they just smashed it. We couldn't be happier. 001001.672 --> 001006.747 Did the little Wildemount theme song. 001053.976 --> 001100.931 So good and you'll be able to see all of them now as much as you want but I figure we'll 001113.442 --> 001115.440 let Matt make it part of the new official thing-- 001115.440 --> 001117.724 It should be available-- 001119.185 --> 001123.724 We'll see. As soon as tonight. Maybe tomorrow or two weeks. It just depends on how that 001128.499 --> 001129.561 service works. 001129.561 --> 001130.387 "Your Turn to Roll." A Critical Role thing. 001135.011 --> 001137.598 You shut your damn mouth! 001141.899 --> 001143.393 Let's let Matt make it official. 001146.999 --> 001152.678 I saw it. That's all I needed. We can head back up now. 001634.234 --> 001636.221 No! We're doing this thing, Nott. We're pushing through. 001639.747 --> 001640.684 Yeah. 001641.685 --> 001645.898 Well, I mean, that'd be great, if we could find that. 001650.912 --> 001653.738 No. 001654.954 --> 001655.919 No. 001657.633 --> 001701.845 Let's see what's down there in general. Hope it goes without saying, if you find any 001709.438 --> 001713.663 remains, let's be respectful. 001713.663 --> 001715.882 No. 001729.475 --> 001731.240 Do we see any other sea life? 001734.718 --> 001739.971 Thank god it's not, "Here's an Astral Dreadnought." 001810.211 --> 001813.922 Oh, that's right. 001824.097 --> 001824.972 Oh, right. 001833.546 --> 001836.925 That's a natural one. 001845.267 --> 001846.876 I have darkvision. 001919.132 --> 001920.336 The first one was a five, so six. 001921.412 --> 001922.911 (raspberry) 002011.024 --> 002012.602 The Tide's Breadth. 002014.925 --> 002017.373 (laughter) 002017.373 --> 002019.561 I don't think I named it in my backstory! The Tide's Breadth, yes. 002028.665 --> 002034.979 Let's go for it. 002121.366 --> 002123.008 Like a seal. 002128.396 --> 002129.676 Per the song? I mean-- 002241.456 --> 002246.718 I mean, what are the chances? The ocean's huge. 002252.519 --> 002255.396 Glass half empty, I get it. It's all right. 002300.690 --> 002302.562 Got eyes right now. All right, we'll push forward. 002308.307 --> 002313.943 Should we stick together, or do we want to fan out and go around? 002355.844 --> 002400.646 Sure, yeah, that'd be fine. 002402.700 --> 002403.971 As we get closer, can we see from outside the ship the extent of the damage from the initial explosion? 002414.401 --> 002419.451 Yeah, no, I chased Sabian down into the hold of the ship, and he was messing with a 002448.380 --> 002455.132 package. I saw a fuse burning. As I chased him back up above deck, there was an explosion, and it 002455.132 --> 002504.043 threw me from the ship. It's nice to know that it wasn't a small explosion. A real motherfucker of a 002504.043 --> 002506.146 thing, apparently. 002506.146 --> 002510.808 No, we were in a storm. He wasn't supposed to go below decks, either; that wasn't normally 002516.841 --> 002524.444 his thing, so it was strange. When he went down there, I saw him. When I confronted him, he threw 002524.444 --> 002526.689 a dagger into my chest. 002526.689 --> 002528.049 Yeah, well, he turned on me real fast. He seemed to know that what he was doing wasn't up to 002536.237 --> 002543.712 snuff. When I chased him above, he was at the bow of the ship, getting ready to exit or jump off. 002543.712 --> 002549.814 Obviously he knew what was coming next. Then the explosion went, and the last thing I saw was the 002549.814 --> 002553.324 ship as I was being thrown off. 002554.141 --> 002557.721 Yeah. I don't know why, though. I didn't see anybody. 002609.588 --> 002611.525 I don't know. I assume. 002616.701 --> 002624.434 No, Sabian was someone I grew up with who was also brought by Vandren to work on the ship. 002633.144 --> 002640.389 Yeah, I've known him for many, many years, and he's always been a piece of shit of one variety or 002640.389 --> 002647.979 another. Only in the most recent years did I think that maybe that stuff had faded between us, and 002647.979 --> 002653.623 we'd found a way to work together. But apparently not. 002654.854 --> 002658.266 Ooh. As an idea, sword in my hand, as we start to push in through that hole of the 002739.257 --> 002745.852 explosion, or peer in, can I lead with the sword and see if the light and/or eye is reacting in any 002745.852 --> 002748.608 sort of way? Or is it just static? 002748.608 --> 002750.935 Not my best. Nine. 002757.230 --> 002758.247 In the sea, certain creatures like to make homes of vessels. You want to send in your--? 002820.696 --> 002826.878 Yeah. 002922.583 --> 002925.360 Oh. 002926.519 --> 002933.718 Why don't you node? 002941.832 --> 002942.662 And drift. 003047.911 --> 003054.984 If you don't mind, I know this ship better than anybody. Jester, would you come up with me, 003142.448 --> 003146.158 and we can explore the captain's quarters? Might be a good place to start. 003146.158 --> 003147.583 No, I'm okay. 003149.462 --> 003150.171 I'll drop the cannonball, and I will push up off the ground, Superman-style, in the water, 003158.559 --> 003201.468 and swim up above the deck. 003201.468 --> 003210.300 His quarters are that way. We should push forward. 003259.559 --> 003301.287 Swim over. 003302.716 --> 003309.605 I imagine so. Could be still. 003329.651 --> 003331.738 I would say no, but there seem to be more than a few things that I didn't know about him. 003338.925 --> 003345.149 You're so strong, might want to give it a-- 003400.886 --> 003403.389 Really? 003427.415 --> 003435.465 It's all missing. Is there anything that I-- 003458.845 --> 003500.258 Is there anything that I see that is definitely out of place or changed that I remember? 003505.853 --> 003508.368 Third one of the day. Let's go with this dice. Natural one. 003511.751 --> 003514.889 Apparently. You can pee down here and nobody'd notice. 003519.748 --> 003523.729 Maybe we should get the others and-- what fucking? Extra? 003541.754 --> 003544.181 I'm always eating stuff. Maybe we should get some of the others to come in and do a more-- 003548.398 --> 003551.439 Yeah. 003552.456 --> 003553.939 Unless you want to give it a look? 003556.655 --> 003600.894 Yeah. He was a tidy man; he certainly wouldn't have left things like this. It looks 003605.882 --> 003611.250 like, either before or after it went down, somebody was definitely fucking looking for something. 003611.250 --> 003616.598 Do I? I don't think I do. 003619.910 --> 003622.704 Could be. Yeah. I'll go get Caduceus and Caleb. 003634.402 --> 003636.255 I'll go get everybody. 003637.726 --> 003640.390 What? 003909.991 --> 003911.935 No. 003912.466 --> 003914.342 What do you mean? 003916.523 --> 003922.833 That's amazing! Lead the way! 003927.532 --> 003929.723 No, let's go now! 003930.988 --> 003934.488 Do you know how far away it was? 004016.112 --> 004017.961 All right. Yes. Fine. Take five minutes, six minutes, and-- 004035.592 --> 004036.469 Is it dented at all, or just scratched? 004115.410 --> 004118.276 Yeah, like an inch between the claw marks or a couple inches? 004123.275 --> 004124.802 While they're doing this, you can tell if it moves, right? 004154.953 --> 004155.816 Okay. 004157.017 --> 004202.820 Glad you remembered that. I'm kind of forgetful. 004210.153 --> 004219.981 Here, underwater? Yeah. 004254.171 --> 004256.147 Might be. Did you find anything underneath? Any remnants of that explosion, 004300.333 --> 004302.168 package, shrapnel, anything like that? 004302.168 --> 004305.984 I think it's safe to assume that that was done after the ship sunk. A hole this size 004435.201 --> 004437.312 wouldn't keep a vessel in the water very long. 004437.312 --> 004448.658 Glowing eyes? 004451.059 --> 004453.950 Pretties? 004455.115 --> 004456.501 Locate Ariel. 004504.312 --> 004506.585 True. Very true. 004512.775 --> 004514.865 I'm sorry, I can't wait any longer. Do you mind if we go? This is all too strange. 004543.314 --> 004545.281 Fuck it, we'll go back up above deck, and we'll jump off the stern in the direction that Jester-- 004554.974 --> 004557.358 Goddamn it! 004606.707 --> 004608.861 Three. 004613.104 --> 004626.011 Oh no! 004707.443 --> 004713.819 We're good, we're good. 004723.690 --> 004725.843 Yeah, dude. 004742.391 --> 004745.689 I'll let y'all crawl up. 004756.551 --> 004758.074 Wanting to be drunk, but not really. 004835.688 --> 004837.277 Oh shit! 004905.404 --> 004906.643 Yasha got a 17. 004909.244 --> 004910.229 Wow, that's high for her. 004914.239 --> 004924.874 14. 004925.620 --> 004927.221 Fuck! Guys! 004930.978 --> 004932.481 Oh Jesus. 004938.568 --> 004940.050 Yeah. Good start. Here we go! The pendulum swings wildly. 004948.291 --> 004950.071 Yeah, she is! Right, yeah, and she is back there? Oh, and there they are. Okay, lovely. 004959.733 --> 005003.084 Underwater, is her speed halved? 005003.084 --> 005004.979 Except mine. 005006.152 --> 005007.021 My armor. Wow, good fucking deal. Okay. 005012.195 --> 005018.026 How far in this diagonal movement would 20 feet get Yasha towards the nearest enemy? 005026.459 --> 005029.419 Yeah. 005030.234 --> 005036.981 Almost? 005037.892 --> 005041.336 Okay, she will swim towards that merrow, and with her bonus action, she would like to rage. 005050.562 --> 005052.529 Oh, yes, then let's do that and get within melee. 005059.515 --> 005103.532 As a point of order, can she also yell, "Don't let them leave!" 005121.930 --> 005123.056 That was more Caleb than Yasha, but-- 005135.614 --> 005138.403 That's it. 005147.173 --> 005150.653 Fuck a duck. Yeah, okay, that changes shit. That's got to go. Oh, boy. Oh, yeah. 005428.190 --> 005431.232 I will, with my bonus action, cast Hexblade's Curse on this merrow, the one that's in 005545.175 --> 005552.458 the middle, and I will fire two Eldritch Blasts at it. 005552.458 --> 005553.713 (drawn out) Eldritch Blasts. 005558.035 --> 005603.122 Four, so that's 12 points of damage. The second one is nine points of damage, so 21. 005618.193 --> 005623.190 Actually, you gain plus three to damage rolls on Hexblade's Curse, so instead of 21-- 005636.464 --> 005638.088 Yeah, with my bonus action, I did that first. So 22 total, so add three. With my 005645.709 --> 005651.447 movement, I will move back under the deck where Caduceus and Caleb and Jester are. 005651.447 --> 005653.964 One step in. 005655.370 --> 005658.853 Yeah. 005659.791 --> 005701.359 Not so I'm blocking the entry, but just so that I'm in, out of thrown-harpoon way, you know 005705.608 --> 005706.613 what I mean? 005706.613 --> 005711.026 If they both have sentinel--? 005745.729 --> 005748.273 I'll make it reckless. 005844.685 --> 005846.987 Got you. 19 to hit. 005914.200 --> 005917.961 13 points of slashing damage. 005924.910 --> 005927.103 Wow! 010250.664 --> 010254.733 The last syllable delivered that one. 010303.124 --> 010305.742 Half their speed and-- 010533.858 --> 010539.175 Come on, Cad! 010629.543 --> 010634.861 Fucking Caduceus! 010802.098 --> 010805.171 She's going to take two reckless attacks at this one that is near her for just a straight roll. 010902.650 --> 010911.786 So 20 on the first one. 010917.645 --> 010918.471 The second is a 24. 010920.330 --> 010921.962 The first one (counting). Damn it. Seven plus three is ten. And the second one-- 010929.272 --> 010936.935 Great. Shit. So if I didn't need that second attack, did I waste it on the one that was there? 010950.123 --> 010953.716 I made it reckless, so it was just a straight roll. I'll use the 20 feet to head down 011006.612 --> 011009.577 towards the one that Caduceus is right in front of. 011009.577 --> 011013.728 Is that melee? 011015.549 --> 011016.431 Okay, yeah. 011017.808 --> 011020.132 I should have to roll, yeah? 011021.689 --> 011023.375 17. 011024.081 --> 011025.434 Okay, great. This does not have the extra d6, so that's three plus six is nine, 12 points of 011031.246 --> 011032.690 slashing damage. 011032.690 --> 011034.659 I'm sorry, Matt. Will you add two points of damage the last one that I just hit-- 011107.878 --> 011109.382 Will you add two points of damage to him for rage damage, because I didn't add that. 011123.240 --> 011124.413 Yes, I will come out of the quarters to move within melee of the one that everybody's 011353.538 --> 011355.637 having the party around? 011355.637 --> 011358.451 Yeah, I have 30 feet. I'll take two swipes with my falchion at disadvantage. 011406.454 --> 011407.303 They're both 15, so that's a 23 to hit. 011411.155 --> 011412.365 That's seven points of slashing damage, and the second one is only an 11. 011419.527 --> 011421.057 Yep. 011421.902 --> 011429.043 Cool. 011433.966 --> 011435.311 Yes. 011435.846 --> 011451.966 It's the salt water. It'll be white around the edges and really sting. 011544.423 --> 011546.531 Okay. 011705.741 --> 011712.393 Yes, she does. Reckless for a straight roll. 011825.160 --> 011827.144 This is her only reaction. Oh, that's a 20 million. 25. 011833.228 --> 011834.373 11 plus three is 14. 14 points of slashing damage. 011846.715 --> 011850.826 Or take your time! Barbarians are dope, yo. 011906.600 --> 011911.855 Doesn't have any damage to it, yeah. 011919.582 --> 011921.155 You drunk fucker. 011922.562 --> 011928.232 Like a turtle. 011939.904 --> 011949.530 I mean, I could, but I don't want to. 012036.593 --> 012038.725 There's not a lot of people that can get over there. 012050.199 --> 012051.899 Not anymore. Fish dick. 012159.965 --> 012201.057 I could eat the shit out of those. 012213.292 --> 012217.626 Oh, you got him! 012224.164 --> 012225.787 Check their corpses. See if they have anything on them that can tell where they came from. 012318.205 --> 012320.051 Nott, really, we've got to get over this fear, man. We got a job to do. 012324.334 --> 012327.538 But where in the ocean, where? 012330.548 --> 012332.622 No. 012333.209 --> 012339.012 Don't do it like that. You know that shit's important. 012432.668 --> 012433.790 If only we could close the barrier to the-- 012442.581 --> 012451.644 Wait, Nott!
