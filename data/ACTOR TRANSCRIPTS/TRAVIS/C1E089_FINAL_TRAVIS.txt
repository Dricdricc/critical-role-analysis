Do y'all hear that heartbeat in your ears? I don't know if I'd go that far. Yes! Yeah yeah. Yeah. Three, two, one. You're doing good. You're doing good. No, no, don't help him. 30 seconds. One minute. The Coke's gotta go. 30 seconds left! 30 seconds left! Work it. Work! Relax the throat. 15 seconds. Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Don't stop fighting for it! Three! Two! One! That's it! That's it! That's it! Oh my god, that's it. Do we have an ambulance on standby? That entire tooth is brown. Your teeth are all brown! The Super Bowl was missing that. There's a part of the back of my head that's cramped. Yes! Take over the world! What the fuck are you thinking? What're you thinking? The distance on that was incredible. Yeah, I could feel your glycogen spike from over here. Pets. Really? Bada-bing! He is part of the Clasp. That's man-made wood right there. Let's do it. Double-birds. Oh no! Oh, shit. Does this happen a lot? (yells) A lot of that? There's a lot of just open-mouthed (yells)? We could just go, we could just leave, it's just fine. It's good. Yeah, fuck that noise. The eyeball's soft, let me throw one more time at the eyeball. Yeah, I throw the hammer at the eyeball. Okay. Reckless! Ah, balls. 23. Nice! I meant two-handed. Oh no, I'm throwing it. 21 points of damage. I'm still enlarged, right? 25 points of damage. Did I manage to (thump sound)? Oh, thank god. Well, we all give something every once in awhile. 'Cause he mind-speaks, right? It brain-talks. Well, he was not happy in the end, there. But he recognized true power and he was sorry to see us go. They distappeared. Good. It's all about branding. Yep. Could you point us in the direction of where your healers would be? Right. Thank you for watching our backs in there, that was real hairy, but we have to be leaving you now. Yeah. Yeah. This is what happens when you adventure. Who? Oh, great. Yeah. Pike, we need your help. Is there anything on his armor? Like, something we should be looking for? Like, a tab or a button or-- No? Let's go get him. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. Yeah. (all laugh) Yeah. I'll go, then. I go over to Vax. Is he on a raised platform? I'll stand over him. I told you before. No one kills you but me. And I think back to being in Percy's workshop at Greyskull Keep and I say, I love you too. And I reach back and I slap the ever-loving fucking shit out of his dead face. (all laugh) 22. Love hurts, Keyleth. How do you feel? Aw, man. Yeah, you punched your card. Can't grow that back, bitch. Yeah, welcome back. Don't be weird. That's true. I'm good. Unconscious. (all laugh) You did it. Yeah, how did you do, Tary? It's so weird. I totally remember walking past you and trying to leave. You can feel free to smoke this fool, it's fine. A little bit. What does that mean?! We don't know what that means! You can't say that shit! Raven King! Wooloolooloo! 69 hit points. Oh, that's pretty. That's amazing. Presents? Yeah! It's nails. Well, most of us do. Mm. Just hold onto it. Yeah, just hold onto it. Don't give it to him. Oh. My. God. Oh my god. Science bro vomit. (laughs) Look what you did. Yes? You look so, like, constipated right now. How did you influence my decision? Is that a bad thing? Yeah, why did I save Taryon? Mm. What does that have to do with me? Tary? Are you glad you're alive? Well, there you go. I owe you one? I thought you said I say I owe you one. How would that even work? We'd just be owing each other forever. Ooh! (all laugh) I leave. (laughs) (laughs) So good. (laughs) Ooh, ooh! Is that a record? Wow. Where'd you get that paper from? Are you in a rush? No fucking way. Shut the fuck up. Shut up. You can not do that now! Are you serious?! Can she do the stuff they do? You kill everyone on the ground. (all laugh) Who needs a fucking magic carpet now? We got a jumbo jet. (laughs) (animal noises) Oh she can change into a dragon but she's-- yeah. (deep voice) Hey guys. (deep voice) It's me, Keyleth. Yeah. (deep voice) I'm so happy right now. Hey, hey! I am clearly moving ahead of them to the front of the fucking line. (all laugh) Yep. Holy shit. This is amazing. Fucking amazing. You can whip those beholder eyes at people? Is it at will or is it a random roll for which eye does what? And same thing, like you drop the shape's hit points and then it reverts back to you. (laughs) Oh my god. Ah! Yeah. That was such a great party. (all laugh) Yeah, I rode the dragon all night. (all laugh) Can I find Tary? No, it's like real late, right? Jesus, that fight knocked you goofy, didn't it? What? (all laugh) Mm-hm. Yep. Yep. Mm-hm. Ooh, yeah. That always helps. Right? Someone like you, I would probably stay on the outside. You got a little in the crunch zone, right? You seem to have a good range on your weapons. Most rods are good close-up but, you know, if you could stay on the outside with it, maybe you'll have better success? But, I wanted to give you something. Yeah. It's like a last resort, right? Cause you went like eee! And it was not good.So I want to give you a magic egg. And I reach into the bag of holding and I take out a basilisk egg that I have no fucking idea how old it is. But, it's in there. There are six of them. This egg is very, very special. This egg comes from a very ancient magical beast. If you find yourself in a dire need. Like in that last fight. If you break it and consume its contents, you will be granted immense power. Indeed. But only in times of great need. I trust I don't have to emphasize how important that is. Shit! Come on big whammy. Yes! 15. I out-rolled somebody! That shit is rank. You're welcome. I got this. Are we going Gil? Yeah. Don't fuck me, Gil. 19. A natural 19. Does anyone try to talk to the automaton? I pull the sheet a little lower. (all laugh) A hype man! Yeah yeah! Mama Pike! Oh god, how does he know how to write? Yeah, yeah! Little bleed-through. I'm so happy. Oh man! Oh no. Holy shit. Oh god. Oh my god. I can't even handle this. Wow. Pick a leg. I love it so much. Holy shit. My fucking-- -- my ears hurt. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're getting all our money's worth out of the boat. What are we gonna do? Oh yeah. Lots of books to read, real exciting. What? Ah, know our allies? Wait, quick squeeze! Ah, no! Ahh! (wails) In a lot of countries it means one thing, especially when sailors do it. Nice. I like cotton candy. Oh, okay. I'm sorry if I hurt you. Okay. Wow, you are really getting strong. Yeah. You distappeared. (all laugh) (deep voice) I know. (all laugh) Can I insight check him? 19. No, is that a natural 20? It's a natural 20. Well, I reach and I grab the dwarven thrower. Welcome back, you son of a bitch. (all laugh) Are we gonna tell him the fucking name or what? It's on and off. Most of the murals are of one of our friends, but yeah. What? How are you going to do that, by the way? Yeah, like, doesn't that require reading? No, they're not, are they? What do you need? What do you got? Yep. Yep. No, he actually gave them to me. Yep. But I found out from Vex, that when you trade, you get something in return and last time, I got a title. Yep. Yeah I'm the Grand Doopa Babink of All Didedah. (all laugh) Yeah. It's a top secret title and it comes with all the land and money, and a bunch of short names. I don't know. Probably everywhere. Am I a fucking child? Because of my high office, I will forgive this offense. Come back when you're serious. Cloak of smashing, title, whatever. I'm sure you're very smart. You'll think of something. I'll keep this as a deposit though. (all laugh) Yep. I did not steal. They were a gift. Pike should read it. Yes! Absolutely. Yup. It's made from, like, flesh? Yep. Yeah, just you two. Oh no, look at that face. Holy shit, look-- Look at that forehead. That's like an F5 tornado rolling in. Let's not turn this into burying the shoebox. It's just a book, let's just read it. He's also not alive. Time to die. I approve of this decision-making. Can I-- Bad story? Jesus Christ. Oh my god. Are we doing that now? I mean, I can help him, just-- Do we? Ooh! You know what? We could like send it into the plane where Craven Edge is and we'll take the sword out and put the book in in its place. Okay. Before we killed Raishan, didn't she say-- Right. And she said she had found what she needed. Yeah. Yeah, Ashley! Stay! You're the best!
