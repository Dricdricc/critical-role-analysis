We play Dungeons & Dragons! (screaming) I'm sorry, that was not supposed to be for the public. That was something that I sexted to Liam. It was not supposed to be released. I can't unsee that. I am doing the forward lean. All of our pages are blank. Where in the world is-- no! Disadvantage the whole game. We forged those documents, right? What was the ship's name? Okay, just checking. That makes sense. That's right, Ignus. I will Mask of Many Faces and give myself a bald head with a nice little red flavor saver right here, and very expensive red and gold-looking flowy stuff. Not ostentatious, or attracts attention at all. Someone might try to kidnap you. This is the Balleater. It's been quite a while since we were in Nicodranas. I'm Captain Tristan. We will probably be here for, I don't know, an extended period of time. We might make our way up into the Empire. Do you have any extended rentals on the dock here? Oh, yes, thank you, Orly. I'm so forgetful. Yes. Be well, Orly. Carry on. That is very thoughtful of you. Thank you! Access the memory banks. (warbling) I think Caleb had something to say. Sure. I'll go to blacksmith with Caduce. North of the Dunrock Mountains, would you say? That's fucking way up there. We are here, and we got to go there. Hundred miles. So, one, two-- in a straight line-- three, four, five, six, seven, eight hundred miles, if we fly. I mean, truthfully, yeah. You could, yeah. Then it'd be Beau-bo-bows. Bo. Now that is something. Beau's bo's bow. Ugh! Is it bigger? You assaulted a seven-year-old. "I thought we were playing!" If it's pink, I kill it. Shame on you. Sure. Unless you want some privacy. Long established. Yeah, I'll drop. I think we're good. Very gracious of you. Hurried circumstances, I think, would sum it up. We did have to borrow a boat. A ship. That's true. We'll be landlocked for a while. Are you familiar with Darktow Isle? Your daughter was very brave. Our adventure took us over there. Yeah, I don't think the Plank King leaves very often. Without a doubt. Our travels took us far and wide, and we are all the more excited to be back on land and to explore this beautiful city that most of us haven't had a chance to really peek about. Very much. That sounds like what we've gathered before. Interesting. I think that's where we want to go next. You notice as you walk towards it and walk further away, it looks like it grows and shrinks? Well, I was going to say like a telescope. You know it goes up and down; it doesn't lay over on its side and shrink up and then extend itself. I'm sorry. Yeah, we got sea dementia. It's really rampant. We rip it out of her hand. What's the first chapter say? Jester makes a valid point. We actually probably should go first thing in the morning so we're all nice and rested, and I would enjoy a nice meal. I dig it. May the paint be with you. I'm sure there are some stores that might have healing potions and other things we could stock up on before the sun goes down and they close up, right? Might as well take a gander. Ms. Ruby, do you have any sorts of shops you might recommend that would have stuff of that nature? That's beautiful. I'm sure either of those will do nicely. Shall we? A little light shopping? Yeah, maybe not into the stores with things that break and then we have to pay for it. He's certainly your dog, Jester. It's your call. "Yes, and," bitch! (laughter) The Seafloor Bounty is over by the-- I don't think so. I'll buy one. A real spitfire. I got a feeling she had more fight in her than you'd think. So before the sun goes all the way down-- I was going to say let's go look at the tower. Everything's chill. Let's make our way over to the, what was it? Mm-hmm? Sure do. If I look up, is that balcony that we saw before about 15, 20 feet above our heads? Did what? Make it appear? And disappear? Do a quick speed round, and we walk around the perimeter looking out for fucking windows and balconies and we meet around the other side. Oh. How high up? 50 to 60. Yeah, that's too high. I mean, I can get up there, but it makes a real big noise. I mean, I don't know what's inside there. Yep, and it would hurt a lot, I imagine. Just from my simple knowledge of basic physics. Yep. But hey, there's nothing that says if we come back in the morning, that son of a bitch might be in a different place, I'll bet you, crackfire, slopdolly. (spits) Yeah! Pick wood! There's no way. That's not possible. And it just looks like it grows and shrinks and grows and shrinks? Maybe. I can't get up there without making a real loud ruckus, so tomorrow morning's our best bet. What about the tree? What about the tree? But how does that work? Immediately? Yeah. That's a shitty plan. Well, there's no rule that says don't ride up a tree and jump on a fucking balcony. Try it. Can I turn around and look at the storefront-- Unless something happens when she knocks. I turn around and look at the storefronts. Are there any that are obviously still open? Right across from, maybe that are facing the... Can I just jog over and try and find somebody that might be working a desk over there? What knockers! Young Frankenstein, just to be clear. I'm at the fish mart. I'm at the fish mart. You don't see a particular door that appears every couple of days or is there a pattern? Yeah, all right. You're an observant one. Anything else that you can share that might help me understand this structure more? Pigeons! Really unsanitary for these fish. How much? I'll flip him four silver. Wrapped in the paper stuff, right? Or is it just the fish? Oh. Thank you. Very appreciative. You have yourself a fancy fucking evening. Success! Yeah, it's a red snapper. Anybody a fan? Oh good. What are you talking about? Haven't we been through enough that the jokes are unnecessary at this point? What little guy? I grab the snapper by the tail and I start gesturing. Let me get this straight. I went to ask questions, you knocked, and some goblin came out of what, the balcony and started answering your questions and then disappeared. Is it still there? You motherfuckers. I don't need this shit. I toss it like SeaWorld. Ducey! Did this happen? Really? And you just knocked and a door appeared? It just seemed so fantastic. No, I don't think that's it. Let's not do that. So we come back in the morning-- What information? Uk'otoa. Uh-huh. We walk in and we say, "Are you missing anything?" That might be okay though, Jester. What if we give it back and he answers us some amazing questions or-- Well, maybe we don't offer that right away. Yeah and we really should go back and get some good dinner and some sleep so we can get back here toot-sweet! Run, double-dash back towards the wizard's tower. I want to see the inside! Uk'otoa. Yeah, you better watch yourself. I'd like to know what he knows, if he knows more about Uk'otoa or maybe how to counteract him. Maybe he's up for a friendly conversation. I don't think we're your average fisherman. I mean, we've seen some shit. Yep, of the utmost importance. Check off a bunch of boxes. Yeah, fair enough. You're there. So who did the knocking last time? Did you do anything special? Can you replicate it today? Then get after it. Power-walking. Grabbed her elbow. Damn it! We do have Earl. We also have news of grave import. We all bum-rush it! No, I'm good. I'm not fucking with this one. That's true. You plus one. Three notes are ask about Uk'otoa, I trust you, make good decisions. Yep. What is it? You've got some high charisma, right? Yeah, go in. Go, that's your fate. Yes. Good. Excellent. (nervous laugh) Fuck. A bright green dragon. Did that door just fucking open? (falchion summoning) Jester, Nott, Fjord, Caleb. I'm Fjord. I'm assuming he's talking about the Happy Fun Ball? I have no objection. Is there anything that we can do for you in the short term? Well, I think if he knew that it helps us on our exploits-- Which thereby helps him. I mean, we are sharing, aren't we? (singing) Give us a helping hand. Yeah. Now! (laughter) In the hands of an assassin. Yeah, she talks to him. And you die. Just him and Caleb, right? Hey, Caleb. What happened in there? (laughter) You expose yourself? She has a good point. I thought we'd hurry back so that we could check. Sounds like a deal. We go through the Wuyun Gates. Trostenwald. Zadash. Are we going to Felderwin village? Yeah. I mean, it'd be Alfield, really. Zadash is west of Felderwin. Yeah. Trostenwald by way of Alfield and then we'll take the Rillway Road? To Felderwin. It's a straight shot. Of course. Do it. Nope. I think this is just a regular cart. How many words? That's 22. Friend of mine? Vandran? How do you know that? Is this the same as Jester talking to the Traveler? You hear from the Wildmother? You asked about him for me? He was making amends? Thank you. Off the path. I'm trying to sleep. What are y'all doing? Aw, fuck. Veering right. Underground? Were they able to repel these attacks? Felderwin. Indeed. We should be on our way. A bit quicker than we thought, I'm afraid. Good to see you. Do you have any deposited checks or bank statements? Well done. Virtuous indeed. Thank you, Bryce. Thank you. We should move quickly. Nott, give us a hyah. There we go. The Rillway Road, and we're going to get to a bridge before we hit Felderwin. You said they look like someone we met previously? Was the blue flash from him apparating? Yes, we are! Nope. I get two letters in and that's all she wrote. SAM and Lady Ve DeRogna? Lasagna? What is it? Vess-- Nope, not there. Yeah. Lady Vess DeRogna. That's a 19. Is there another way out of here? Second set of stairs into the house? Yeah, I'll search with him. 21. And a picture, and a picture! We have a tripod. Hundred percent. We sent a message once. Is it worth trying it again? Anything else in this room that we need to turn over before we get out? Put everything back in the chest and bring it with us. Put the chest in the haversack. How was it locked from the outside? You didn't see anything when you sat in the chair, right? Why the chair? Why in middle of the room? Why lock it? We need to not use that dodecahedron anymore. You could send them to Alfield if you wanted. I'm sure Bryce could take care of them. If you don't feel comfortable here, you should tell them-- Worst case scenario, they could go south. You could send them to Nicodranas, I'm sure. It is. I don't know how far or fast this is moving. Why the chair, though?
