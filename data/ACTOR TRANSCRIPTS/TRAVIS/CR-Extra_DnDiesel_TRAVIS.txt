I'm Grog, a goliath barbarian with a love for combat, women, and ale. It smells really good around here. Is everybody all hesitant? I'll knock! Let me show you how we do this. I go up and pound on the door real hard. I don't do well with emotions. I'm really the group knocker. Somebody else want to take it from here? There's laughing, gurgling, moaning. We sure it's not a bar? Might be so bad. You're greedy. What do you have on you? Yeah, we follow. 20! Great. I take the greataxe and I swing it and I go for a frenzied strike so I get an additional attack. Say Here, Moppet. (yells) That's really good! That's a 24. That's a nine. That's 14! d12. That's nine. Dang. 12. That'll hit. Nope! You miss. Why me?! Makes sense. Yes! I think it's actually an improvement. You're welcome. Glad we collected up front. 20. That never happens. I don't like it. I go into a rage. Yeah. I don't like the dark. I never liked the old woman, I'm just saying.
