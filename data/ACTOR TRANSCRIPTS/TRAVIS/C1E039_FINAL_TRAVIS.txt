(laughs) Yes. And make fun of our DM. And also find us during the days in the general hall area, we'll be around quite a bit. And it's super cool. Yeah. Matt and I are both in Warner Bros. Home Entertainment's Batman Bad Blood! Which is out right now on Digital Download on iTunes. It's solid rock. Can't move. Yeah. I play the Heretic. Matt plays a million other people. It's really cool, check it out. We fight Batman. I sing Taylor Swift songs and all that. You and me, we got problems now. (laughter) I'd like to Great Weapon Master right now. Where's Scanlan on the map? True colors, (singing) shining through! (laughter) Fuck yeah! 20, to kill Scanlan. (laughter) Well, I hope you're hungry. But you have to wait one second, we're a bit far away. Can I travel as far as I can towards? 50. Do I have a line of sight with him, or is the edge of that outcropping blocking it? Could I back up three squares, so that I could move to my left so I could get a straight look at him? Can I go one more? Can I use the Javelin of Lightning? Oh, yeah, I've got it. I utter the magic word "Penelope" and I throw it and each creature in the line, excluding me and the target, must make a DC 13 dexterity saving throw. Just the target then. Huh? I don't remember, it's just in the bag. Can I try and throw it? 18. 19. Can I go into a rage? I would like to rage. That'll miss. You have more dice than that dice store. Oh, are we flying? Fuck it! I take Craven Edge out. I hope you're hungry. And I would like to go into a frenzied rage. And I would like to attack, the first two times, at the big purple dick that just came out of the ground. Which way? That's a 23? 20? Wow. 26? The third one I wanted it to be, should I reroll since I didn't specify? 17. I do, I do. You're right. 2d6. What do sixes look like? They're squares. Jeez, three, eight, 16 for the first one. And 16 for the second one. Oh! Yep. 21. Saving throw, right? Constitution? Ooh! I have Danger Sense. I have advantage on dexterity saving throws. Holy shit. No, we're good! Shut up! We're fine! Holy shit. He's inside. Come on, Armageddon this motherfucker. Yes. Well established. You could either dispel it or you could flee. I have advantage. Danger sense. Dexterity saving throws. Total of 20. She would know better than that! Does Pike have Dispel Magic? Okay. 18. What do I--? I can't leave. I'll just back up to the tunnel leading out of the-- yeah. Oh, and I'd like to start to revert, if I could. No, I don't start to revert. Probably no. Shouldn't there be an ad for Gilmore's Glorious Goods right about now? Uh-oh. He grimaced. Still rolling. It's all right. I've had worse. Did you hold your action? Until when? I'll do the same thing. Come on, Percy! I can't go get him, though, 'cause the other dick lord is still on the map. I can't get to him. I'll run up to the dead earthworm and try and cut Vax out of his stupid stomach. With Craven Edge. Did I just help midwife Vax out of this thing? 20. 17. Ew. It was only one-- it was a couple of strikes to get him out, right? Yeah, that ends it. He's unconscious; don't listen to that piece of shit. It's like Pulp Fiction with the adrenaline shot. We are still hungry! And I rush up to giant dick smear. And I would like to use reckless attack on my first of all three great weapon master. Let's do that. That's a 23. Oh, Jesus. What's 29 minus five? 24. That probably-- Yeah. I've got to do the math. 22. Okay. 12. 20, plus ten, 30 for the first one. Eight. 13. 21, 31 for the second one. Three, eight, 16, 26 for the third one. I'd like to take Craven Edge and jump up, straight up, as high as I can and drive it straight into the top of its cavity and just drag it down and open it up like a beautiful bouquet. Like Icy Hot. I want more. Who's next? Can I look in the blade and go that was good, wasn't it? That was good, wasn't it? Well, fucking answer me next time, Jesus! I can get over there. Do we want gold? I run over to the gold. I run around the worm and run to the gold. And I (yelling) frenzied rage-loot this shit!. Just hacking away at it! We don't have anything to store it in, really. That's pretty long. Too long. Do we leave the cave or do we use the teleportation circle? Must go faster. Must go faster. Five minutes. Five minutes. Don't leave. That was you? That's true. Give him a bit of the tea set, we give him the dominoes-- Yeah, why do we care if they have money? That makes sense to me. Is the skull with the gem in there still? All right, I go over and grab the tapestry and the skull, hold it like a knapsack. Can you hear me? Yeah. Right, good, maybe-- Shut the fuck up! Wait, wait, wait. Last part, last part, last part. I take off running out of the house. (yelling) Guys, you've got to come out of the house, now! We've got to get out of the house. Now! The house and the skull are linked. As long as the house stands, his evil will grow. It didn't say. The house has to be taken down to the ground. The portal must be destroyed. (loud and angry) I just heard this fucking-- (calmer, hesitating) I. Have... premonitions at times, it runs in my family. You know, when I'm drinking ale, this voice goes like "Stop!" But I'm like "No." And I keep going. And sure enough, I should've stopped. Are you saying anything? 12. What? What? Why do you say that? Reverse psychology. I'm really bad at it. That didn't work. Talking to the sword? Pike? Honestly, I'm hurt. I'm offended. And we are not fucking equal. If you want to get equal, we can step out here, and handle business like men. I've cut you open twice. Twice. Pike, can I talk to you for a second? (scoffs) Talking to my sword. The skull has a voice. Yeah. I picked it up, right, because I was just going to carry it out, and it said, like "I "can grant you a wish. Any wish that you want." Yeah. But it's a wish. We can wish for anything. I don't want to put it down. Yes. I drop the skull. Lying? I hadn't thought of that. What, the skull? Yeah. Besides, if it grants a wish. I get the fucking wish. I told you. The house is evil. The portal has to be crushed. It's an evil portal. Yeah. The skull did. Don't look at me. I'm just the translator. I'm okay with that. It's in a knapsack. What do we want to do, Pike? She's in the stockade. Only problem is getting caught. I like her style. Should we get her out? Yeah, can't we post a bond or something? There's one place I haven't done it, and it's in a prison. Like a cousin? Whose baby? 'He'? (laughter) You're a baby daddy? Holy shit! Did you lock that up that night? You paid her for it? I'll take that, though. I take his drink. I give it back. Do you want all of us? Or a smaller party? I can stay with her. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead and ask. Don't we have earrings? Wow. You don't want to go back in there. Did you tell her you're her dad yet? That's awkward. Just the silverware's missing? I have a question. Can I wait until everyone goes to bed and can I make my way into Percy's workshop? What's the door made of? Can I try to pick the lock? Can I shove an axe in the lock hole? I have a greatsword that's just a normal greatsword. Yeah, like a credit card in the side of the thing. Like a crowbar. That was crap. Ten. All right, I go to bed. It did say as long as that house stands, it will be very powerful. Is it safe in Whitestone? I mean, the temple of Sarenrae is at least here. (high-pitched) The sickest burn. That's the sickest burn! Oh fuck! Maybe we should go in and check on it. That's a relief. Could I have also gone to Gilmore's? No no no, just, we go in together and when he's talking to Gilmore, I find one of the lesser clerks and I say Do you sell lockpicks here? Yeah, you know. I keep locking myself in the shitter and I'm really tired of asking people to come let me out. It's really-- Look, I've got these huge clumsy-fuck hands. Is there anything you could give me, maybe magical, that would just keep me from being embarrassed in front of my friends? It smells so bad and then they all come and the door opens and it's just awful! No, do you have like a wand or a potion or like, a thing-- Fucking shit. (laughter) All right. It's hard, right? When one ear's in and one ear's out, it's tough. I was trying to plug it. Can I look up, too? Are the red and black dragons? You're sure? 20 again. Well, I only do one thing-- (yelling) I go into a rage! And a frenzied rage! And I take out Craven Edge, and I say, how do you feel about dragon? (laughs) Great Weapon Master-- I run up to the dragon and hack away! All right, fucking hell, where's that son of a bitch? 19. Everybody hear that? 22. (mutters) That'll miss. Just on the one. Oh, yeah right, I'm sorry I was so caught up in the fact that I'm just literally going up against death incarnate-- hey! 19. Ten plus eight is 18. 18. If I had resistance to poison damage because of the Belt of Dwarvenkind, is that halved? Oh, fuck me. I'm like, I can't remember-- I can't remember what I'm trying to do. We got to go! Oh hey, awesome. That's a 19. Wouldn't mind turning into that mist right now. Yeah, just go. Just keep-- it's not about Gilmore right now-- it's Scanlan's turn. Thank you. I'm booking ass. (mutters) I'm okay. 26. Holy shit, look at the size of that thing. What the hell? We need that skull. The skull grants a wish. You just massacred people. You just committed genocide. Well done!
