hi liam oh is this a podcast now (old-timey voice) old time radio damn it ooh it's pretty good though i like this better than the ipad yeah how can we not see him he's a mountain of man i'm rushmore right is that how it looks so we have video problems i'm periscope-ing until we're not having video issues oh we are okay bye guys we're live yeah he texted she's negged you said the next few days without incident cool i suggest against this no i'm against this are we nearing the destination get it out now i think it looks good on you grog nice i'm going to sense the weather i suppose because this doesn't look fun ooh it's cold i don't like this scanlan like we were discussing earlier would you be interested in the still-standing trade of my ioun stone for your circlet-crown thingy what would you like for lunch i already ate well keyleth if you could put a little slate up for me i'd like to illustrate something for little scanlan and perhaps his tiny mind can comprehend it (clears throat) would you perhaps do this i'm going to walk up to the hull and be like-- oh (clears throat) i see prestidigitation some chalk you see scanlan you've had this particular piece for over ten let's say matches or weeks you have used it zero times in over six battles over the same course using it zero times (laughter) which none of you can do other than monks of course when i can do multiple spells like two versus you who can do one that means that i can do one more spell than you can per round (laughter) and every round after that one hundred percent (laughter) your utilization of the actual item has been equivalent to nothing in the interest of the group and the use of items in general it would be wise to switch it because you have needed extra spells like invisibility-- several times where my item would be more useful in general to you oh me absolutely not i am one of the strongest casters in all of draconia and it only takes the strength of my charisma to do my stuff that is a movie so scanlan what say you i don't like to show them off oh wonderful thank you (explosion sound) now you can store up to three level spells three of them in there and you don't have to expend spell slots to do the spells you can put three lightning bolts in there and it costs nothing i'm sorry it orbits it is fancy festivus oh good idea yes of course i will be your mage guard (laughs) oh the tribes or maybe they got lost to the winds of the road oh goodness which means of course understandable ooh who was that person everywhere we go it's everywhere we go why can't people be normal i've never been here and there's enough in the interim for a short rest from us getting from there to the last day to where we're at okay cool awesome no (laughter) i'd have to take off my cloak though to wear that right i won't wear one i keep my cloak on okay yay it's like a little-- but i believe it's white right it's a white stone ah there you go i would like to look for any places-- oh sorry that's a long time to be out of order sorry i'm tiberius stormwind and we are vox machina everybody has names too i'm going to look for any temples that might have a sigil inside while we're going through the town i'll ask the yonn guy right hm hm vonn yonn oh scalebearer yonn that's a fun name (clears throat) as we travel through town if you could point me to any place that would have a sigil of arcane-ness-- oh ah no i'm fine he's talking about other people oh of course i do i'm a sorcerer no no i think he-- sure it's fine i'm going to take it you don't see very many dragonborn in these parts oh yes it's-- no i'm of the chromatic nature i'm a bit of an anomaly in my family they're all of the metallic brand i assure you the stormwind name runs true and wide throughout draconia but-- i cast alter self real quick and i turn myself into i believe gold because that's the red-- equivalent of red on the metallic scale i think that would be better for everyone involved oh sorry thank you thank you i'll take the six and i'm taking up the rear following behind look percy it's draconic see that scanlan that says something like apollo justice something it's maybe the rise of the justice of the phoenix it's a lot of things is it lit in there you're leaving it is on the shiny die i don't want it to be a hydra oh that's right ooh is there a super clear one that she could try to go through first (crashing sounds) dammit no you're going to roll a one (whispers) no they'll probably just put her in prison i think that's where you're going do i see her seriously again your highness what is your problem the classic the classic handcuff wrist twist i nudge grog grog grog i'm nudging you i'm just nudging you because kima did something super hot i would imagine that's extra holy (laughs) this temple goes to six that is good though i take it all in and i'm reminded of one of the museums at home the square things with all the paper leaves in them and squiggles i read a lot of those can't put my finger on it unfortunately yes well yes will we have to contend with the defense systems as well (laughs) very good question right (laughter) she gets it she gets it like not around are we all potioned up are we all-- we're good (laughs) burt reynolds you've done it again it's dank down here oh light oh (fssh) i de-cast light what is all of this poppycock oh very good light while we're standing around i'd like to reassign the earrings to vax grog and scanlan because we're always together we're always kind of in the back together and they're always kind of like up in the fray so-- she's always kind of like in the middle she's the wild card he's always in the back with us also because we're the ranged dudes vax check for traps oh are we good okay 18 mm-hm and i take half so i take half is it 24 total oh oh my robe are you getting used to your new foot vax i'm going to prestidigitate a tiny air shield in front of me that's what i'm

much as i can of it and start spinning it burning the webs as we go mm-hm-hm fire cleans all sweet (quietly to marisha) is my magic on stealth too i back up i have my cloak on and i'm going to go ahead and cast stoneskin that's what i do right now (quietly) yeah she's a ranger she can cast stuff did i manage to catch with the control flame my entire fire breath when i did that and i'm controlling it still cool it's fine just not in a hallway with stairs as i see this can i release my control flame and let the fire breath just happen and not control it anymore okay so that's what i was using the element of what i did so i used it so i could have the fire got it can i cast something else damn it i know but i like doing lots of things what 15 he just went to go poop or deal with--
