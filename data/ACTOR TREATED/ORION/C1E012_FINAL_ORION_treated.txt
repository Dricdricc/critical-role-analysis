good evening everyone oh it's called giant penis jokes oh my god and nothing else i've joined it already team hooman ify what the snugglelord you didn't think that would wait oh they went to the country greece well i don't know they might have interests i'm not aware of just saying i think a new one is the djinn like there's like a djinn race like there's an air a water and a fire and earth elemental-- like a half human and yeah-- i think the new expansion like djinns however you say it and i believe like the monk and sorcerer are the only ones that have like the point system that's why tiberius is so bumbly sometimes and really doesn't know shit it's his first time out in the world-- which one of you is a caster what are you ify are you gonna do the backgrounds for them gilmore is fantastic fantastic fellow yeah lot of you asked about my mending wheel 'cause i've used that a bunch and the mending wheel is part of something that tiberius' personal quest is about that i wrote and gave to matthew it's like this is-- yeah it's like over two years now wow it's been a while but i said here this is what his goals are this is why he's travelling with this group of people and that is like when i found that thing he doesn't make it you know very difficult but he doesn't make it easy either like when we came across it there was this npc witch right and we had this interaction where he-- it was about something else our main quest that we were doing and he said he was describing her place and he said something-something wheel just and was listing things and i was like wait a minute that's one of my things i think i wrote about and i then as tiberius inquired about it then that became a conversation between me and the npc and i had to-- does that apply now is that gone (quietly) oh no i had to negotiate some of my fortune which i still don't know what that means but i had to give that to the witch npc in exchange for the wheel of mending which is the very important thing in my quest so-- it's great it's been great really horrible-- but the cool thing is i didn't describe what the wheel did i named what they were and matthew then decided if it a) if it was existed b) what it did and you know how it worked and all that stuff so that's-- it's cool because then i'm surprised and i'm the one expecting to see it i'm still surprised and it's great yeah that was like their father was a big part of one of our main quests it was insane you need to always just wear that shirt while we're waiting i'd like to address a couple things that i've been tweeted at about roleplay and what i think about roleplay and how i'm super hardcore about it i always tell people who's kinda like wanted-- my friends who are like i have no idea what that is and i was like the best i can explain how i roleplay is as soon as i sit down and as soon as he says the narration and then we get into it i immediately just pretend i'm like 12 years old again and i'm this guy i'm this kid and i have my-- or ten or 11-- however i don't know age anymore-- ten where imagination is the strongest where i put on my sheet and wrap it around and that's my cape and i have my flashlight and that's my lightsaber or whatever the hell and i go outside and play 'til my mom comes to go have dinner or whatever and i'm dirty as hell when i come back inside everybody's done that we've all been kids i'm just saying also when i play d&d that's where i go it's just-- when everybody's not thinking about any kind of thing other than having fun that's my best advice to just kinda roleplay just have fun um by the way i have been playing this wrong all the time because-- no 'cause we had this conversation yesterday and i was like i don't understand mercer's trying to kill us all the time and he's like you're wrong he wants to make you a hero and i'm like what (laughter) some dms do it's just like an armored fucking enchanted horned beholder motherfucker yeah sure he's not totally trying to kill us but it is a good point like i should've been more-- i shouldn't have been so fearful as i was i'm literally thinking he's-- i know matthew that's why i'm going to be showing up next week i will be i'll be here but we put a nice tablecloth on the table that's inappropriate penis oh sure to what you're saying too what matthew i don't how to say this what matthew allows me to do is for all you casters out there if the spell isn't in the book ask your dm if you can craft them i've-- matthew has-- if it doesn't exist he's let me make spells that's what glacial blast is it doesn't exist here but i was like hey i wanna do this thing that doesn't quite isn't described in here so you can ask your dm and he can figure it out with you i of course always give him way-too-op stuff he's like no and then he gives me an actual spell it works whose line is it anyway matt eldritch blast eldritch blast that's for the attack yes say yes thaumaturgy that's all you need that's gonna have to be integrated somehow and i'd like to say to everybody who's watching that had those questions about how do you roleplay how do you have fun you just saw three dudes with different levels of experience having all an amazing time and we loved every second of watching it so no game has to be the same you play it how you want and that's a good time or that money it's true it is where's your cake that was very paul blart dude oh you're responsible for the potato balls yes
