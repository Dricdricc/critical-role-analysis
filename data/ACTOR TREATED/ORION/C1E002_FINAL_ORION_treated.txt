surprised also do you have a map wonderful i'll take that (laughs) this one needs a whore sorry (sam grunts) all right if you all don't mind i suggest we item up a bit and before we get too late and we get too drunk grog go back to that lightning -- main-- manor-- lightning cage house thunderbrand (matt laughs) both parties cross-plane and i tell them what happened again well i went to this door

i do often do and nothing doing oh very good hold hold on before he does that i cast prestidigitation and i clean it up real quick and i hand him a parchment and go if there's anything wrong just write the message on this and we'll come help if there's any emergency and i hand him a parchment from the scroll of telescription that i made i made like 15 tickets right now and it takes me an hour

dispel magic 13 yeah are they fourth level or higher fuck it's a flying magical carpet it's a flying magical carpet i'm waving hello watch out for that rune it's still on well it's a pleasure to meet you my name's tiberius stormwind and these are my friends that's what i'm trying to say is that i came here looking to ask about the arcane studies i'm extremely interested in that when i heard that your house was the only one that was in that particular study i was immensely intrigued i respect the arcane arts so much that it's well it's been my life and right now we're in bit of a situation where we have to go slaughter a bunch of nasties in apparently one of your mines and we don't know the source and it appears to be of an extreme arcane nature of the dark sense and i figured we could come to you for help and some kind of guidance and i will-- scanlan will you stop it and it appears that you very well know something that we could learn from with all due respect of course 11 i will send you my associate the dwarf turns around and begins walking away with his staff i'm gonna cast alter self on myself to be a dwarf oh shit i cast it on her instead (loud thudding) keyleth where have you been she had an accident on the way over here we were hoping maybe-- who are you the house of valor it's not the house of vulva scanlan (in marisha's bad accent) let's go to the north we don't need that don't worry about that by the way i pull out a bottle of air just an empty bottle and go and plus we have this groovy so business is good what would you suggest and do you know of any things we should particularly buy before we leave going into the mines and encountering nasty naga-type creatures and other kind of things i could take one all right calm down enchanted arrows is what she's asking for yes they would be very much dear sir have you happened upon any-- --relic or artifact around here or heard of something called the pale stone this is a rare artifact i've been looking for for quite some time oh you appraise very good i don't need one i bring out my bottle of air and i go i have this and i put it back in he's balgus grog damn it yeah they see that crap all the time i want to detect magic for a while give it to me i love elevators oh light (snaps) she said it was dark and then i cast my spell who and what are those we already know do i detect any magic stealth twins 2015 i love a mystery i'm gonna pee my face off (liam imitates rushing water) enjoy our butt shots everybody (clears throat) greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called ty'rex located in the heart of draconia from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerer's rite showing prodigy-like control of my magic the judges and the draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member as it's rather boring however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for months i would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever i found those answers to be unacceptable a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms going from town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a red dragonborn i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed so i could explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there some may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that (stammers) i am much sharper than most give me credit for i just don't pay attention to things sometimes i've also been known to be rather cunning loyal happy-go-lucky and well dangerous i can't help but show my true scales every now and then but overall i think i'm quite friendly for a dragonborn sorry everyone tiberius has returned so in character as always so the winner of the evening is going to win both a signed photo of the cast of critical role as well as a signed player's handbook of d&d's 5th edition is (clears throat) did you hear that i'm sorry i'm gonna dispel my
