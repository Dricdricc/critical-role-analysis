going through yeah oh man oh no let's go everybody let's go if this is where we're gonna be chilling i can seal off that tunnel still right no it's permanent but we would just have grog hack away at it for a while-- it can be you know destroyed right kima was here i need to rest yes possibly possibly should i seal the tunnel cool so i do but we would sure hear them if they were-- oh i actually
