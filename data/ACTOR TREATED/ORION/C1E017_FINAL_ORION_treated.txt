can sleep with the pigs i'll stay in the free room i found it to be very entertaining let's look through your shit scanlan yeah isn't it weird when other people get upset greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called ty'rex located in the heart of draconia from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerer's rite showing prodigy-like control of my magic the judges and the draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member as it's rather boring however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for months i would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever i found those answers to be unacceptable a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms going from town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a red dragonborn i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed so i could explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there some may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most give me credit for i just don't pay attention to things sometimes i've also been known to be rather cunning loyal happy-go-lucky and well dangerous i can't help but show my true scales every now and then but overall i think i'm quite friendly for a dragonborn hold on i haven't come out of the room yet right so i do i see grog going there drinking his thing i use my mage hand and i whack the ale out of his hand i make my way down to the thing and i tell the bartender give this warrior water this might be your problem grog you lost for a reason and you're a warrior yes i know that vax i'm just saying i cast invisibility i'm at the dock right i'm going to cast fly on myself and see what's going on no i'm still invisible for a round i'm going to do a (whoosh) to where they are i'm going to where the attack is not to them i'm flying around i'm above you here i'd like to go get my money at kraghammer i suppose you're right i'm going to cast fly out of my ring on grog i'm going to cast it at 5th level and i'm going to cast it on myself i'll keep it on him grog and trinket like last time remember trinket now we've touched down and we're traveling is it like a thicket is this rough terrain we're going through is it plant life how far away are we from each other i cast stoneskin right now 18 i have all kinds of things if we can nudge it into where he's drinking then box him in i'd like to do an investigation on his-- oh yes i rolled a 21 guess how much he weighs damn it too big keeping within 100 feet of it well vax can move is that my best pov okay actually we can move anywhere right now right you're running up the stone is any part of the creature still in the water cool i'm going to cast invisibility and i can see it because i'm on the other side of the ramp right i'm going to cast chain lightning right at the foot yes it is it's a 150 foot range and i do 10d8 damage 17 how do i count these there's a bunch of sevens stupid ones all together oh 38 43 greater i'm going what are the big lumps are those trees i'm just going to go right behind that tree seven more subs 22 that's what you usually get it's still on the same position it was though right when we started right and i go oh no you don't and i stick out my ring and chain lightning him again yeah i know and i had one stored in my ring no i thought that was the ioun stone we all learned something today kids i don't do that instead fine i'm going to cast telekinesis once and i'm instantly going to do quicken spell and do five sorcerer points to cast it immediately again cast it on one head and another head and (bashing tying sounds) to try and wrap them all and choke them wasn't terrible what is that natural 20 and then i go back against the tree that is my turn wait what rules we don't know the rules i don't know what that means hold on wait no hold on i peek over and counterspell okay well he's 20 feet in radius himself isn't he sweet i'm going to-- oh there's a lot of people though who are they i put my ring out and i'm going to do instantly quicken spell do five more sp will bring me down to one sorcerer point and i'm going to huck two fireballs right in the center of the hydra but you're off to the side you're not on it are you on it 20-- what is that-- 29 31 35 36 so that's 41 34 so that's 39 yes it's any fire attack spell save 17 oh hold on a second wait i want to put a pause on this real quick i asked the question before i cast the spell is the hydra itself 20-foot radius and i got a nod so i figured my spell-- diameter radius is different from diameter okay well then it's fine i'll shift it closer-- plus his what oh my god before the last one reaches it i actually cast really hard control flame it totally doesn't work this way but i do it anyway you bastard i didn't mean to do this and i'm going to hammer like i did with flaming sphere when we were playing in private that was really cool actually i did that sorry my aim was off
