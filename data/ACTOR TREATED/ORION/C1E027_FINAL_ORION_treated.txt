can i get a teaser what did he smell like fun fact sam shares a birthday with my mom that's why i'll never forget your birthday ever they can vote for you it's a new day i didn't waste it at all he's in the kitchen how far away are we from the keep we do hear that as soon as i hear that i cast fly on myself and (whoosh) by the way for the record matthew i have no idea what we're fighting i'm just saying i haven't meta-gamed here 15 your cape is looking really nice vax stab him hey what do they look like how far can i get 60 feet was it 40 i thought it was 60 it was double the-- shit hold on i have a card-- 60 feet i'm going to attempt something i haven't actually tried before because there's one to my right and one to my left right do i have visual of both wraiths okay sorry i call them wraiths okay so i'm going to cast at-- i'm going to try to do this about now i'm going to look to my right and my left and at 6th-level i'm going to try to do glacial blast and split the damage and try to hit both of them because it does 8d8 damage-- i'm trying to split my arc so instead of doing this i'm trying to-- (ice sounds) at sixth level it's 8d8 damage 17 cool right hand does-- oh sweet sorry my bad right hand-- that's 14 to my right and then 18 to my left so 14 to my right 18 to my left the one that doesn't save gets (freezing sound) so i see a big flash and what do i roll seven okay so as soon as i see the flash i go (yelps) that's all i do (laughter) i rush over to desmond and out of my pouch i bring out a sandwich that i had made earlier i hand it to him and i go desmond decker here have it it's a decker sandwich you should have it it's safe how's that sandwich i would say opaque buttholes i rolled one by accident a hard 12 give me a day i will find out seems like we're up against either vampires or liches prepare the troops there will be some changes made to the keep over the next couple of days we shall shore up security as well of course we shall discuss that in the-- is it the morning it's good right i had one yesterday no you should stay in the guest room come yes it is let's take you upstairs and get you all fitted who do we talk to that works for us that does the actual construction to the keep he shall stay in my quarters don't worry we can enchant his room as well to have an alert thing go on if anything happens in the room at night and it would be safer i shall be sleeping in my laboratory for the next several nights as well speak for yourself erwen where is that old man oh shit never mind i'll talk to you once we've slept go back to sleep i didn't realize what time it was i thought it was 1000 am which is totally different than 600 am i didn't know that i sleep in my little nook in my laboratory i'm going to take some food and feed it to lockheed and roll for my animal handling for the day 16 oh very well try this hakuna frittata it's really good yes they did me it was rather inconvenient i hate them sorry i mean what yes i was getting it back what about drawing him out to a luncheon or whatnot why don't we hold a special dinner when do you plan on leaving we can leave we just cannot flee we can travel as we see fit we just need to let them know where we're going seeker would you mind staying for a week or so before your venture we need time to convince the council to let us leave without conflict and to procure particular items and things that we need very briefly would just take some time ultimately protection or a good ear what of eight days instead of two weeks oh sorry i agree we need proper preparation percy i'm pretty sure you have a good background on vampires and what-have-you as do i as i've researched them in the last couple of days there's other things that we should research as well and probably arm ourselves for that kind of conflict if it comes to it quite frankly i have a feeling if it's the whole town we're dealing with we need to find out how many innocents there are to save and if the number is low enough we can fly in with an army ourselves which would take some time the draconian knights i am an ambassador to draconia officially after all the assistance i've sent in giving them the wheel of mending and proving my point no i showed it to them proving that my quest was true which they gave me full ambassadorship which means that if harm comes to a stormwind harm comes to all of draconia and a town full of vampires and liches-- if worse comes to worst even then our relations must be strong with emon we need their allyship as well draconia will not go into things alone we need a union i go up to jarett eight days what do you think of eight days as vex is saying this tiberius is getting a half-chub travis and you can't see it because it's inside i'm just saying sorry her brain that's what i'm talking about (ripping noises) i'll give him two strips of scroll of telescription if any harm falls upon you write on this i explain what it does i have 30 tickets left so 28 now can you give the seeker an inspiration before he goes on an adventure but a lot more eloquently than that only with greater invisibility you can there are a number of innocents that we need to figure out still she attacked us and i will not back down from that decision how many days do we have i would like eight days to prepare tiberius puts his hand on percy's shoulder and go i'm sorry for the tragedy which is your family and what these briarwoods have befallen to them and i will promise you i will do my best to have you give that final blow from that barrel to the names assigned to them but now it is a far dangerous situation as you very well know i go to my laboratory use the earring real quick i'm going to write a quick letter if anybody goes shopping let me know wait hold on can i pause real quick you don't need to do this if you want to make more ammo and other stuff i can do this without you making this and spending the rest of the time if you want to make other stuff option what is the diameter of this i was just going to say what's the radius of the actual thing's lens so it's only one foot two feet three feet are you sure you want to do that i thought they were all mirrors (grunting) let's see okay (clicking noise) you going to gilmore's we're going to gilmore's too we could go together if you're doing that i give him extra get me 20 how much do the stakes weigh like each stake tell him that he bought me 20 more i only have eight just kidding no the real quick one is going to the temple of sarenrae to pick up a canteen gotcha okay cool second thing i drop off my swallow or i'll call it the surge blade and to have that enchanted on both ends one side fire the other side water so however many mages i have to hire for that to happen in ten days i think we talked about it being eight days or something like that or was that only one side i just want it to be a magical weapon okay so i'll do that i stop at gilmore's and i drop off my ring of protection and pay whatever that is to add a plus-one to make it instead of a minor an actual ring of protection i thought gilmore said they could do that there before that's why i was going to cough up the green for the gil as it were how much would that be how about buffing the ring of source spelling-- no not right now i didn't know all that stuff was going to be that way that's why i asked (laughs) so okay while the days are going i want to roll for animal handling to teach lockheed stuff which is every morning whatever like with advantage i'm just having fun that's fine that's fine i'll take that that's 17 17 i want to teach him to be quiet yes i got that that throughout the days i'm going to go all the shops and see how many glass mirrors-- i'm looking for mirrors just all kinds of mirrors every size i'm looking for five-by-five to ten-by-ten size mirrors yeah no inches i need about 1500 of them can i get 1500 how many can i get okay all of them you know what that's true how many if i laid them out on a flat surface how many-- (laughs) how many feet would that cover i'll take all that how much is that done and then for timeline stuff i'm going to do as much as i can to start enchanting my bolts and i'm going to go work with keyleth on stuff i'm going to try to make as many sleep bolts as i can but the other thing with keyleth is i would like to enchant a bolt that is a smoke screen but it consists of holy water so i use a pour of the day from the canteen and use that as a mist instead of a smoke can we infuse a fog spell with a sleep spell can we try super hard god damn it okay what am i rolling 24 don't worry it came out of my pocket okay last thing i stop at allura's i remember that as i walk up and i go back to greyskull keep oh wait i don't do that i realize what i'm doing and i stop you said i could do that carrying groceries in look guys hoagie stuff cool can it cost more if i hire a mage sweet and i do two of those and i'm broke it's going to be a lot more than you think apparently oh come on for a fog scroll here put it in here you do not make the wisest decisions here your majesty i must say the guy who built stuff regardless did i do that or is that just in my head so i didn't do that yet i going to tell erwen to go and ask for court for the lord that can construct and tell him that we would like to make some changes and have the cells converted into barracks for our soldiers that's what i do that's what tiberius does getting a good reputation does not mean holding prison cells oh maybe you should have said a different name that's true (laughs) at the end of the first day before all of that stuff happens sorry guys this is necessary i'm in my lab the first night and i write a scroll of telescription to my father and i go dear father and i tell him about the circumstances with the vampires at the end of it i go i invoke the ambassador's right of war time as of now and moreover as your son when i provide concrete evidence you will know but in the meantime i would have you gather 50 ground troops of the draconian knights and 50 winged soldiers of the wyvern fleet have them at the ready for my signal i know it will take you a few days of travel to get here but this is a town of vampires and possibly liches which you know need to be destroyed no matter what your son with love tiberius i don't know what's going on over there damn it have to provide proof to my fucking father fine he didn't say no which is what he always says which is a lot better than what he always says i'm talking to myself scanlan how are you doing grog that make you thirsty what if we went on airship instead we have one at our disposal do we not is briarwood keep over there well then join me in my laboratory everyone not yet i go hey look at the laboratory guys what do you think scanlan it looks like you're impressed i use my sigil there i got it set up there even in real time always go in the backdoor should i go first everyone sure to make it across if i cast it on him i would probably jump on myself because i'm a little bit heavier than you are darling you can have him afterwards fine proceed no i don't i don't do shit yet i wait for you guys to get across so if something happens then i can cast it it's fine i hop on trinket and i pet lockheed and then i hop on trinket and i cast fly on him and say remember how to go across and then as we start flying across i cast telekinesis on grog and take him with me kind of like green lantern yeah that should be 12 seconds to get across a bridge right i'm going to dispel the fly but i'm going to hold the telekinesis for the ten minutes i can on grog i'm not going to do anything i'm just going to keep that spell going how much time has passed can i try to catch them because i still have the telekinesis going (yelling) why matthew i know vax can't i grab vax wait you're grabbing him you i can manipulate a thousand pounds i guide vax back to the cliff i rolled a natural one with negative two harpies a harpy's a jerk a stupid butthole who's super loud i lit it with my spitting i find a little patch of dust and do a little dust bath real quick and then i'm going to use one of my books of stuffs and start researching liches just because i want to tobin's spirit guide i'm gonna feed lockheed some treats it's so dark in here because of the cave thing oh they will have lookouts whatever it takes to get to that back door nine oh 19 i use my mage hand to help is this the same ravine that we're travelling across 16 i cast stoneskin i fasten my cloak of displacement well of course it saw us
