hi i am orion acaba and i play tiberius stormwind the dragonborn sorcerer level nine super badass oh my god oh hey he made the introductions folks oh yeah on a more radder note final fantasy type-0-- you should play-- is out also i play nine in that and matthew mercer plays trey in it as well seven does maybe eat nine who knows who knows but it's definitely a different take on any final fantasy you've ever played and as a fan i'm excited so check it out too every tuesday three nights check it out it's clear that when that brain thing hit grog with his zapper thing that it rendered him unconscious i would assume that it is a magical creature just based on the attack alone quite right you have something don't you how many entrances-- how many ways or edges where we are because it's like at the center anyway-- whoa where's it coming chat room (laughs) oh i'm using my mage hand to poke her in the face ah is he a farmer oh the carvers i poke her more (all laugh) how many cavern entrances are there from where we're camping right ooh an artifact we can bring back to-- i like trying things 24 yes i-- wonderful this is wonderful magic missiles of course this one has seven charges while holding it you you can use an action to expend one or more of its charges to cast the magic missile spell from it for one charge you cast the first-level version of the spell you can increase the spell slot by one for each level by each additional charge you expend the wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn if you expend the wand's last charge roll a d20 on a one the wand crumples into ashes and then-- would anybody like to tinker i mean i learned this when i was 12 (all laugh) oh i'll hold onto it-- yes we miss you oh all right i'll roll for the-- i'm gonna do an intelligence right 20 well 18 plus two what's that oh it looks like this oh interesting i tell everybody that well that i'm with it seems it's a protective symbol of sorts but it's of bahamut which is a good thing bahamut is the essentially nicer deity of the two between him and tiamat which is a total asshole but-- right so she must have camped here put this symbol up for protection oh dear no i don't think-- i think we should alert the others how far are we from everybody we're just like-- oh rumbling is never a good thing scanlan just the campfire oh it stopped i do prestidigitation and wake everybody up-- -- with a little spritz of water in the face everybody get up yeah because it's-- i do it again and clean everybody up sorry sorry it's off i-- oh awesome there was a rumble okay we need to get grog the others and-- i was just about to do that yes but everybody hates when i do that wonderful tune give it to her did you want my hand or the statue statue ooh vex you should plant one on him didn't you get advantage on that yeah why are you all cheering why did you run out and destroy nothing look what you did you were giving me crap about the lightning don't ever do that again it was a group effort really but keyleth did an amazing job yes i saunter over to keyleth that was mighty impressive that was amazing what's happening oh yes of course we'll be right there you have one he has one she has one they're like walkie-talkies i think it's like 500 feet ooh brain suckers i sauntered up 'cause-- you guys are sticking to the darkness we do i'm assuming it's got to be a much smaller mutated version of our brain-on-legs friend yeah that's true that was a symbol of bahamut and it was a protection thing that i'm sure she put up to protect herself it was yes it's okay vax i don't know what a lot of people are talking about all of the time and we know what we're going into i could make a mirror with like an ice-type of thing-- it's fine i cast prestidigitation and clean it all up nice 20 it makes them smarter in the head oh no it's true as we start to walk i cast stoneskin on myself (sings) keep on keeping on is that what we're going to do 11 scanlan what's going on it sounds like it would be a mind flayer of sorts a mind flayer or mind slayer i'm not too sure i'm pretty sure it flays your mind i'm never encountered one myself so i have no idea really oh right let me check my books 14 it says right here mind flayer the rest is all inked up i got water on it (all laugh) percy could you take a look at this oh grog i heard that where they used 300 puppets it's amazing wait a minute we want to bait them is that what we're trying to do how long is the bridge true i think i might have a solution i think it's about time i used these for non-combat things i think we should create a diversion but let me do it i can use my deck of illusions to generate any kind of number of sorts of creatures or whatever that i can control i can simply toss one out i believe 50 feet ahead of me and control it and get their attention i can draw them back through the bridge using the illusions taunting them along the way they of course will give chase because they are (chuckles) idiots and as soon as we get enough we can all-- you can hack away at the bridge all you like grog we could both burn it we could hack and burn well that's all up to the deck it's up to the deck if i generate something such as-- as exquisite as a red dragon say i'm sure somebody like the mindfellows-- if they do flee the camp will be empty and we can search it and free the slaves if not they will give chase and they will come and bait it either way it works in our favor i do have feather fall oh don't worry about that grog i'll just cast fly on you because i can fly yes we can both fly of course the bear we have ways across i just said the path would be clear it's all up to the deck exactly either way they're coming for us i mean did you see a way to do that we can try both oh it's an illusion that i control i'll throw the illusion on the fake lands run off the bridge-- vox machina (all laugh) as he runs off i cast greater invisibility on myself i cast fly on myself and i hover fuck i'll cast fly then yes and i'm at enough edge to where her illusions are as well but over the bridge just in case i fall as he does that i toss out three cards right at the rim of where the illusion stops yes ah the ace of spades-- two of spades it changed dammit looking at pathfinder right now (all laugh) flip them over they have good graphics on the cover oh it must be a joker uh no they exist until i dispel them yes they do i command the lich to start doing one of his glowy spells and like through him i go (whispers) come for us your death awaits (all laugh) i command the soldier to start swinging his sword oh total he lunges at the lich sweet and i'm like-- yes yeah he's like right at the edge i can't throw my card on the fake ground they'd fall they're right at the edge though i command the-- i start-- as that's happening i start to pull back and float away and i'm commanding all of my guys to come through the bridge because i can command them within 30 feet so they're now they're all within 30 feet of me retreating as well (gunshot) yes oh oh bother shoo i go get him is he conscious very good i go just to touch him i am not trying to pull him up he is falling fly now fly damn it wait you're unconscious i ask right now is he-- he is okay then i don't do that because you can't fly yourself so i do grab him this time oh my god 12 it's a 21 i slap him with mage hand snap out of it not from that distance i don't think his sniper rifle goes far i mean seriously yes how many are left after all that let's take a short rest while we're figuring this out wait hold on a second-- is it still-- it's just at the end of the-- all the way down there so i fly down there-- -- and go get it it's still in effect ooh you're right i take out an empty bottle while i do this and you don't know this yet waterfall ah i retrieve the magic carpet ah here you are by the way cool stuff down there it's actually not lava it's water aha believe it or not it's about 150 feet from the bridge but it's about 1000 feet down all the way we could traverse down somehow and i think it would be a nice place to go explore especially because we have nothing else to do and-- oh that's right well i'm still flying you can take-- percy would you like to come well i-- whoever's going down should be on the carpet 'cause i can still fly so i don't need it i think we should-- oh oh that's awesome waterfall not a lava fall we can also go in the not-lava cave keyleth i know because of the lava let's go tell the others what we've found and then we'll come back and decide which way to go i fly back up guys blah-blah-blah-blah in the water but across the way is a 25-man battle with a huge nasty boss not with the eye of that mind flayer i don't trust it so its range is probably like 100 feet there's more like tunnels that go further-- there's so down there there's a big pool of water-- -- a tunnel going towards the mind flayer side with no lava-- -- and then there's another cave with lava-- -- that we can go going away from him a draconian does not vote well i don't vote i don't believe in our system anyway that's none of your business i don't know what that means throw a red one throw a red one that was gonna go right in my mouth i follow i follow i follow hold on i fly back up to tell them what's going on you guys are just in further then oh i take the carpet-- -- and then i bring it up while i tell them all that stuff oh yes because they need it to get down here as well i was-- yeah and i followed you saw what was going on took your carpet and i'm giving it back to them oh i thought you guys hopped off it was terrible i fly back down yes mm yes i'll be right there i was trying to get the rest of the party here but everyone's being buttholes i fly back down with the carpet hello oh did you make a friend wonderful yes i'm a sorcerer i do all kinds of fun things with the arcane very good i'm always willing to learn seems you are very powerful the rest of our allies are up ah yes we have wonderful allies i'm standing between them like it's okay these are the allies we speak of grog don't do anything don't use a whip scanlan sing a friendly song as he is our friend-- ally to the guy ally he is-- he's in a little spot of trouble and we are going to help him get revenge or something of the sort he prefers-- oh i
