related i leveled my undead holy priest to 64 last night on warcraft i guess we should follow him then that can't be good i'll talk to him i say into my thing scanlan what the hell's going on okay well there's a mind flayer here right right i turn to clarota i'm like ooh that's our friend pike she's a good ally hello pike sometimes we hug as allies clarota oh those are fun thank you very much clarota yes oh dear that's no good (all laugh) clarota we've already allied ourselves with you as we've already agreed as we said yes but the thing you wear on your head it would make us all the more equipped to take on this task it's against such powerful mind creatures such as yourself i know my way around a couple arcane things but nothing of the mind control sorts if someone like me were to be influenced it would be very bad for our group even yourself perhaps it would do well to at least maybe show us how you built it and-- you get what i'm getting at right sounds like a lovely town yug'voril we have to fetch him where you were right well said grog i don't even know if he saw me he saw my funny cards oh i cast prestidigitation on pike and i clean her up real quick don't worry grog her majesty keyleth i'm sorry clarota is totally fine to talk in front of he's amazing those last things sound terrible i pull out my empty bottle and i go and i have this wait what's going on isn't this the same water that you bended there's only 26 people up there on our last count after clarota he's asking to-- yes i'm reading my book i love coconuts oh i love doing light things if you can make a pair for our friend here that would help him out i assume clarota the mind hive that you possess how close can one be before it actually affects say 100 feet caught my friend in mid air alas in their run-in is its range about-- your hair looks fine before i retire clarota you said you wanted to speak with me later anything in particular or you wish to save it for after the battle ooh i'd be happy to discuss it i could learn a great deal from you as well later of course i go to my books don't move 16 yes probably buttholes oh i had the same dream scanlan both why not both well there's two targets so we all strike right on him you two are going to take that little journey the rest of us what shall we do i have many options and they're all fun so percy your sniper rifle i should think that you want to post up and start taking out position yes of course onslaught to the rest of the camp that we'll go about it too right make a bunch of noise a bunch of light perhaps you can fly i cast stoneskin oh right so i don't cast it then (all laugh) god damned concentration spells is everybody finished fly am i light enough for him to take me in for him to carry me i hop on your back let's go grog back up the other way other way very good wherever i move your head just tilt that way it's really rickety just think you're not listening it'll just happen nothing i was saying if you're all finished i'll just make you invisible right before it happens we can all talk to each other (sputtering) i cast invisibility on you that's when everything happens (all laugh) we land on the roof we get in there i cast invisibility on you and then you go do your thing we would risk that anyway either way wait i have an idea is there enough weight for me get on the carpet at this point yes i do it's 1000 pounds everybody how much do you weigh i'm sorry your highness but i need to know the idea is if i can step off on the carpet and hang with you guys then grog you can float down to the whatchamacallit and take vax here then i can oh shit i need to be near you to cast it damn it (all laugh) we need to wait before we light up down down oh yes 20 yeah do it yes when i do this though it's going to be very cool (all laugh) right i use my earring just to remind you of how these particular things work i'm not actually talking right now so you can just talk to each other through the rings come on in -- with greater invisibility so you can attack and you'll still be invisible sure do subscribe now kids (groans) i cast stoneskin immediately we don't know anything we just heard a scream oh we can act on that damn i got 16 i have 16 no no no as soon as i cast stoneskin you were attacking that's why i said this is all going-- this is all you're good for nice i'm still on the roof right what can i see like if i go down what can i see oh wonderful yes i think i'll stay right here thank you very much and how tall is the roof how high is it 15 feet okay wonderful wonderful so let me see here this is fun i'm waiting for him to do something 'cause it's so cool awesome okay i'm going to-- i see the two guards behind vex right is that what's going on and then the one duergar in front of grog is that what's going on too pillars yes no they go up to 25 yeah that's why i always ask that question it does 66 bludgeoning damage when it's pinned 17 (reading) why doesn't it say i guess it doesn't it doesn't say oh wait a minute no you make this call if a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle a creature on the pillar takes 66 bludgeoning damage and is restrained pinched between the pillar and obstacle the restrained creature can use an action to make a strength or dexterity check against the spell save dc on a success they are no longer restrained and must either move off the pole or fall off of it so they still it still happens but they're not pinned by it got you okay so go ahead and roll damage for all of them 27 damage i did 27 damage to each one i go like this hah i use two of my sorcerer points and i cast quicken spell and i look at the general and i-- because of my books i've been tampering with i cast blight on his eyes okay 'cause i wanna (all laugh) yes he takes 8d8 damage and if he saves he takes half the damage 10 15 15 plus what is that ten 14 29 yeah because he made his save oh shit you can make him do whatever thank you oh that's a 20 two oh great it's a rock butthole (all laugh) is he rooted grog smash right through his plate thingy such a bummer i'm looking in i'm like oh that's no good i look at where he made the crack in the armor where is that is that in the head right awesome i'm going to kind of motion towards the mind flayer and give a telepathic wink yeah and i'm going to cast telekinesis and i'm going to pry open the metal i'm not going to target the creature i'm going to target the armor yes six damage and i'm going to spend two more sorcery points and do the spell again i'm going to do a-- i'm gonna do firebolt right in the hole and i'm going to use my metamagic wand to fire the spell oh that hits can't do that i zap him i zap him for one no no no no i empowered it full it takes ten damage 'cause i empowered the spell yes nice nice move super play that thing did it hit the floor or did you go again don't forget your boots pike try harder next time oh okay yeah he's an emoji now someone asked what alignment we are first question what alignment are our characters tiberius is chaotic good this is my first campaign also i was a magic the gathering fan our character alignments do matter on how we play the characters an earlier question i was crying to answer your question there is an origin of tiberius fully written i won't say it all right now but he comes from a political family and there's a whole bunch of layers to him he is a thought-out character the buffoonery is half-planned well they asked if i actually thought out a story for him he does have a thing for this character named allura she's super awesome hot i think she's hot ooh like thai food we just had a bunch of chicken that is an awesome episode cut to them weeping donkey kong pikachu somebody asked me what my favorite smash brothers character is what about you keyleth when this was going on i asked matt if there was a caster yet like any glass cannons and he said no so i debated between a wizard and sorcerer when we went over the different mechanics how a wizard and a sorcerer works i was more drawn to that and i'm a huge rpg guy to piggyback a quick question to seal off the tiberius thing somebody asked if any of our voice acting influences our characters tiberius absolutely i played elminster aumar in the neverwinter mmo which is a d&d mmo and when we started this i'm essentially doing elminster but i made him super bubbly uh troll penis story i know you guys keep asking i was getting raped by trolls it was spitroasting i'm doing the same thing for the record at our keep we have a keep back in-- matt does control the music while we play music people out there and when that was going on i remember when that went off being still tiberius i was like in half character but half not and i was not crying i was like (grumbles) the whole time and as soon as she sprung back to life because the cleric-- we luckily because i know it was a tight roll when she came back to life is when tiberius i was like oh my god she's okay where are you going i wish i could turn to sam but he's not here i feel tiberius is just me with magic so that's how i feel there's a wishlist oh that's easy tom hanks for sure (all laugh) he lives for this shit what tom hanks isn't guys tweet at tom hanks to come play with us that'd be hilarious i'd like to like-- amy poehler i'd like to have one of those i'd love her tina tina fey i don't think he's ready for this jelly you guys think he's ready for this jelly i don't think so reacting can we get a jib i like crane shots put it on the wishlist somebody asked a fun one they asked if we play what's our favorite video game is it well we can skip it oh shit i was just saying i'm a big final fantasy fan i like all kinds of games i definitely would say if i had to pick one rpg cause i'm an rpg guy i love chrono cross that'd be my favorite game i've played that more than i have chrono trigger which is way too many times type-0 also dammit that's a cool question if you had to switch characters matt if you had to switch characters which one would you be yeah if you would switch characters i'd definitely be grog just the complete opposite of what i can do for the horde he hasn't died it's amazing this thing has not died he should have died so many times it's good to change her as a character i was gonna say that was a good one my favorite kill is actually-- when pike kicked the bucket and that moment all of us realized what happened and there was an instant shift in real emotion where whatever the hell i don't even remember who we were fighting because i went like fucking cast this and everyone's just kill this thing because we all cared so much in a real life situation where we hated this thing with real emotion and we just slaughtered it the fight ended there him and tom hanks tiberius and keyleth were not happy with credit to sam as well which was voted down was also the brotherhood of the sisterhood which i was a huge fan of i really wanted it to be the brotherhood of the sisterhood but vox machina sounded cooler so tiberius recognizes as the vox machina/brotherhood of the sisterhood wait does cathartic mean sad i'd say for me it was doing type-0 not so much the actual lines 'cause i had a lot of fun i don't know if that's cathartic but completing an actual real life dream goal i've said this a couple times before but the last day i was recording the last stuff i was literally crying on the way home because i finally got to level myself up and this thing kept it up and it was really cool yeah it's one of those big-- how do you keep players from getting op matt behind the scenes i'm always constantly up his ass trying to make tiberius as op as possible and he's always stopping me a lot oh when he started hoarding all the gold i would live in the next generation world universe see and it's a big hassle yeah somebody seagullblaster-- asked-- tiberius said something about the palestone and what it is and this is somebody asked a different question this is kinda gonna answer both i and everybody else wrote backstories for matthew to essentially give him so he could construct our universe tiberius' particular quest is looking for particular artifacts essentially i made him like mulder nobody believes in the city that these things exist except him so the truth is out there kinda thing so i made up these five different artifacts that do different things and i don't know what they do until i might maybe find them and if i do it's up to him to matt to determine what they are if they are anything they might be nothing i don't know i've found one item so far and it's awesome and all of us have given him bits and pieces and that's how he constructs our story with things that you throw in yourself was that the fancy-- obviously some butthole which one is it the final boss that was insane when the mud on the face and the stab in the fucking back of the head i won't the old fellow right oh that was a crazy one too i had this amazing spell with pathfinder called aquasphere orb and you can like capture large creatures i literally can waterbend a sphere and carry this dude and drop them down it was amazing i miss it so much continue the story i did it again and held that fucker it was intense with all the eyes i have not but i would like to go and yes we did roll for our starting stats that's not d&d is mtg magic the gathering a tabletop is that considered tabletop magic i'm circle of orboros so do i tiberius might not-- tiberius jumped out the window and just cast featherfall that's for a magic item no i would love to do that i'll be there saturday
