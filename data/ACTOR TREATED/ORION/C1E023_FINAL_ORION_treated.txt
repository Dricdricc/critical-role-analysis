are we talking about mad max hey he's scrotus i play scab and a bunch of war boys so check it out because i work with this guy here yes speaking of mad max again because it's super cool i've actually partnered with twitch as of ten days ago so i'm doing my twitch and i've been playing the shit out of mad max so follow me on there orionacaba at twitch and check that shit out nope i'll go to your place and watch you play it because i want to watch you play your character yeah that's weird ew that's gross how does it feel on that side when i played with will friedle-- our mighty dm versus hercules it's still 24 hours since we had the feast right it still counts as the same time i used it twice and you said stop bothering me tiberius though he definitely said my name and told me to stop my bad sorry about that well a stormwind likes to finish a sentence and i apparently need to start a sentence correctly for you to hold your attention long enough right sorry yes how does it work with gnomes yes i've never seen a gnome birth before it's right here i open my bag of holding (swoosh) it just doesn't fly anymore i went to draconia for like two minutes and picked one up oh well i teleported i went there came back no a rakshasa i have a suggestion first i'm going to bring up lockheed keyleth if you think you could help i'm going to take him out of his cage and put him on the table here he's diseased you can maybe see if you could perhaps use your medicine strengths to see what the problem is yes i know that's why i asked earlier as the other guy no i said i fed him but i didn't say what i fed him excuse me oh i'm sorry i was waiting on my first request before to see if keyleth could do anything but a wineskin yes laura and emaciated as far as the matters at hand i of course grog encourage your violence and taliesin i do quite like the idea of going back to emon-- oh sorry i'm sorry speaking draconic again percy sorry no that's not your mother's name i'm sorry percival i go over to percival and i give him a hug sorry i'm scaly i like the idea of going back to emon but before that i do believe we should go back to kraghammer and collect our gold taliesin and did we say that already taliesin and wonderful i was concerned about lockheed i'm going to put him on my shoulder of course i give chase i give myself fly so i can go over the crowd it's fine i realize what i'm doing and i stop do they feel that he wants to fight him i also know i use my mage hand-- oh no i don't i don't do that i have 600 gold pieces-- i'm going to break my bank and follow suit to my human friend 612 is i think all i have left no it's not it's a gamble so we can make more and plus it's giving faith in our friend the ddt he monked up oh my god a grog punch to the balls i'm going to argue that that should be doubled because there's two balls (laughter) wait against him no he meant advantage because balls damn it no he has tough nuts never mind inspiration you also smell that was a burn what if i shot off a prestidigitation firework she's foreign can i do something real quick i want to be like excuse me and i-- sorry no excuse me and i pull out ten gold coins that's all i actually have because i had ten left (laughs) and i take those and i give them i'm sorry this has been a misunderstanding she's foreign and she's royalty please i'm from draconia she's from-- she's a druid i say all this shit really quick and i'm like i'm so so sorry what was it deception deception so that's 22 and 21 as they do that i'm like you said dragon for philip no it's grog now i'm not there i'm arrested plus ten grog we got arrested while you were fighting just so you know never mind i'm going to use the earring real quick again whenever you're free grog can i now use the damn earring okay grog (stutters) could you use your clout to get us out of holding because keyleth tried to do something and i tried to talk her out of it and it didn't work out and we're now in holding it's fine i mean i tried to help her out a guard looking at me vex here we are i'm from draconia just say where you're from that's easy i'm sure they don't know what draconia is but i like to spread the word as i leave he's speaking draconian he's speaking draconian i heard him she casted heal and i tried to talk her out of it and i just got arrested too hold it when we're released i would like to get my winnings back great wonderful no she's paying for that laura and she had other gold oh shit that's right i'll pay you what was it 24 i raise my glass of water and cheers as well no i like that idea we could take the airship and you could craft some things when we do go i think i might have an idea for our carpet situation no that didn't work it kept it intact but when we return to house thunderbrand i believe we have a few items that they want the deal was when we procure certain items we will be allowed to have certain information and certain-- we didn't explain what we were going to get but we should return get our gold and definitely visit house thunderbrand they are strongly arcane perhaps they can enchant for what we have procured for them in that venture and maybe that could be a good way of getting around getting our carpet re-enchanted without costing any coin scanlan when you describe them to me thank you it's a piece of gum what is closer to kraghammer emon or where we're from oh that's fine are we all ready to go are we ready to go after that are we ready to go we need to go to kraghammer to collect our 30000 gold waiting for us 25000 sorry while we're there house thunderbrand we've procured a few items or at least one while we were down in the underdark we should return there and talk to them and perhaps in exchange for gold perhaps have them enchant the carpet to fly again where does he hail from what is a pope it's okay she's young thank you for the information and foreign have a good day i think we should all leave scanlan are you satisfied in your knowledge you've procured wonderful grog i'm sure you would like to go to a pub of sorts laura and oh fuck shit i walk out of the bar i went back into the bar because i went to take a piss outside what is going on hold on a second i've had plenty of water i'm fine (slurred) scanlan has been ordering me water for the whole time has been cleared we know who he is do we need to pursue this guy i'm going to do a daily roll for my pet because i'm going to try to teach a trick and i rolled a 15 yeah at the end of the-- does it just build up points today and then try to scout cool little treat tell him it's grog's-- we know where they're at right we don't know where they're at if we could fit it in the bag of holding it would be much better i start casting circle of teleportation oh i choose emon emon i go through too i'll hold it for a minute to explain the travel schematic it would take us a few days to come back on the airship to this particular area if want to go back to kraghammer it would be much more efficient if we teleport as we have and take a transport to kraghammer which is only north of here as well which will only probably take a day right airship from here to kraghammer right the airship right so we just shaved off five days i can split the load we're doing the paperwork well there you are and here's my-- oh scanlan hold it notarize it yes collect our money what time is it right now in the day could we ride maybe drunk riding we can go to the keep and say hi to everyone no we have servants that do that well you're welcome to do so-- what is your skill sir ah your sword as he's talking i motion to open the gates i go inside the keep are they inside yet i look right at vax why did you do that to that young man stop it it was aggressive beyond necessity we should have trialed the boy that was not a trial you are far more powerful vax you know that this boy was a fan at best we could have put him to work or something and if he comes for your head vax you and grog i respect and fear the most out of all of us you are cunning i could crush you in one blow scanlan vex i fear you and am slightly attracted to you as well grog and vax you are the strongest and most noble and cunning-- you believe what you believe i'm just saying when it comes to things sometimes you really rush into stuff and stop because you could just be chill sometimes (laughter) as i see her i turn to greet but i want to give vax a little pinch on the butt a little friendly pinch it's all right we forgive you i give her a hug sorry i'm very scaly oh you shouldn't really it's fine yes you can scanlan invite him in for dinner oh what is the attire for the event i'd like to see what they propose
