greetings and salutations  i am tiberius stormwind  i hail from a town called ty'rex  located in the heart of draconia  born from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerer’s rite  showing prodigy-like control of my magic  the judges and the draconian high council were amazed at  how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training  at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member  of the magic guild in draconian history for the  next few years i almost went mad from the  malaise of being a guild member  as it’s rather boring however one day i happened upon a chamber  unused for quite some time  in the room were stacks of books and maps  of the surrounding cities and areas  around the known world  for months i would frequent the chamber and learned  of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts  that caught my eye  i brought these findings to the high council and was told that  all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled upon  was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries  and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable a year later i devised a ruse and managed to  convince the city council to lend support  in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace  and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms  going from town to town and making friends and allies  in and for the name of draconia  being a red dragonborn  i had quite the task on my hands in that respect  but it was exactly what i needed so i could explore  the world and find these artifacts  as i felt the truth was out there some may describe me as buffoonish  but i say poppycock to all that  i am much sharper than most give me credit for  i just don’t pay attention to things sometimes  i’ve also been known to be rather cunning loyal  happy-go-lucky and well dangerous  i can’t help but show my true scales every now and then  but overall i think i’m quite friendly for a dragonborn
