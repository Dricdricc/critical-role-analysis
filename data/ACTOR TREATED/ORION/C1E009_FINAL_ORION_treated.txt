and be like keep it simple will you i mean really calm down bear and vex (fumbling) can i do something right before that okay that's way better than a two 21 great i peek over the little thing and i go ooh and i throw a fireball from my ring oh right in the juicy spot of those three yeah (mumbling numbers) i'm missing d6s wonderful (mumbles) that's 31 damage and then i spend two sorcerer points to (crackling sound effect) form an ice knife why i said the juicy spot of those three i knew grog was there of course i wouldn't throw it there okay fine (all laugh) yeah but i thought-- i don't know and i throw that right in the back of queeny's head 19 sweet and then that's 1d10 so that's a ten and then it (exploding sound effect) shatters and then does-- where the fuck is it-- 2d6 damage as well in a five-foot radius so yeah and that guy's like right next to her right 31 cool and that's four points of damage to both of them and i have greater invisibility so i'm still invisible and i just peek back behind the rock oh yeah baby you know you can cast that from a distance is it oh i see it i cast counterspell (fwoosh) what is that 22 i'm going to slink my way all the way behind the other rock towards everybody closer yeah back there you go i'm going to yeah screw it i'll do another fireball at the illithid going away where do you think you're going (fwoosh) yeah so that's-- 19 yep oh crap i forgot about that one and i'll move on the other side of that rock so i can see better and have line of sight no on that side yeah wait can i do something can we react to this i see it and i cast hold person what is all this poppycock not me you're pretty good (all laugh) (stammers) can you be more specific like do we go left or right or specific i want to check out the queen i rolled an 18 for arcana and you know i wanted to check for-- i place the circlet on my head laura and (stammering) i thought that was a and for ioun stones i can have up to three in the head slot okay then for the time being i take off the ioun stone and i (fzzt) dissipate it and put it on this essentially allows me to-- (stammering) anyone who wears it can maintain two concentration spells for two rounds it's 824 well none of those people are us it's really nice i dissipate invisible and i approach keyleth your highness by the honor of all stormwinds i will let nothing happen to you i swear it i will fight until my death and i have ways of course to get us all out of here whenever i damn well please do not worry oh do you need light (fwoosh) before we go to sleep i cast a bunch of spells in stuff greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called ty'rex located in the heart of draconia from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerer's rite showing prodigy-like control of my magic the judges and the draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member as it's rather boring however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for months i would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever i found those answers to be unacceptable a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms going from town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a red dragonborn i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed so i could explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there some may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most give me credit for i just don't pay attention to things sometimes i've also been known to be rather cunning loyal happy-go-lucky and well dangerous i can't help but show my true scales every now and then but overall i think i'm quite friendly for a dragonborn well yes it makes perfect sense clarota i would think they would grant you a hero's welcome as well i follow behind them and call out to him are you using levitation or what how are you-- is this how you-- oh okay i still follow clarota i'm like so is it-- do you do it with your mind or is it just like-- were you all taught as a child to be able to levitate because it seems-- good to know understood stick figure (all laugh) am i mistaken you're really damaged still so the scars are as i notice i go anybody with (mumbling) knowledge of medicine should give a whack at cleaning some of those no grog that defeats the purpose agreed hm oh ooh yes they're pretty i take out one of my daggers-- yes i do have daggers-- and (clicking noise) i'm going to chip away a couple of chunks oh yeah okay (mumbling) 14 cool sweet oh i use my mage hand and i push it too everywhere is dangerous yeah sure you want to shoot an arrow for me love i thought we were all following half-orc i'm going to do an arcana check of 22 just on the pile of bodies nice yes this is what we need and that's what this is let me take it and do-- i'll use that arcana check on that i think this will do for our friend back up on the surface or under surface (mumbling) this protective amulet of the shield  adding plus five to your ac against that attack nice it's like a magic shield well i'm the only glass cannon 14 i'm going to follow and i'll stay behind enough to where i can cast do i have to get in the water also okay i'll get a little-- i won't jump in quite yet but i'll get to the edge that's a medical condition for a goliath we could just keep going where are we on that map what type of boat is this is that all we need to do okay fine and i walk over to the thing and i jaunt off into the water oh it's so cold i take out one of my bottles right before i go under my bottle of air i swim over there i use my tail i think i'm a good swimmer and i want to swim up to where i can see the boat oh okay is it darkened can i see the boat now yes i still have my staff how large is it okay so i notice it you're nudging the one that you want right is that's what's going on so i notice that i (ping) my ioun stone direct telekinesis to lift up the boat out and i cast telekinesis on the boat to lift it up i try to get it just right on the lip i'm underwater i'm going to jaunt back up up to the surface i put my bottle away i don't know it's a good question i mean i don't see why not percy why don't you give it a whack before we put a boat on the mending wheel oh yes here you are why don't you tinker it first my spell doesn't last that long i saunter on the boat up next to grog and go excuse me as i open the bag of holding and take out the magic carpet (sound of carpet unfurling) and i hop on that i'd rather be a free agent on this one i'm not here to fight on water are we all agreeing that have we all decided to come here or here coming in through here which is the least resistance directly to the temple yes absolutely 13 oh we are on the carpet i'm going to use my earring of whisper right now there's some fun things in here grog you're not wearing it someone tell grog he might need to kill something where are the bodies located sharks don't die as soon as they get out of the water you can last a couple minutes out of the water if you're a fish what's up zac and good entertainment good entertainment much like scanlan's penis you
