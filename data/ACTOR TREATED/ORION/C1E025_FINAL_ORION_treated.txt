lizard-brain and sniff out immediately allura and i'm going to go find her (groaning fumbling) and i go to lockheed and i use my telepathic bond that i have with my pet and i convey to him to tell her i emote to him with my telepathic link with him and i (foreign words) that's what i emote to him right and i try to have him telepathically tell her help i do this (frustrated noises) that's kimchi astronaut i lick all of vox machina i lick grog the most i go up to him and start sniffing him (sniffing noises) i lick the cleric (licking sounds) no i just wanted to really do that that was really inconvenient let's help vax yes i was quite frightened most of the time i didn't know what was going on i couldn't cast spells and i was-- let's help vax that's good yes you shit yourself vax i cast prestidigitation on his butt as it happens i reach for my decanter and i can control the charge it's just charged but i dissipate the charge but also keep it for a little bit no i dissipate the whole thing and i turn to the cleric and i go oh holy man which cured my mind would you be so graceful as to use the force of sarenrae to bless the water in my canteen to bless it i'm going to hold it up above my head way too dramatically no i thought you could like do a hosannah and get me out of here wonderful how many days give or take do you think it might take to accomplish oh wonderful we'll be here for two days guys i'll leave it with you yes good eye i give you 50 thank you for your service the other 25 is for my brain you don't have to sell it-- and i awkwardly bow out and say see you in two days oh mighty brain fixer i don't disagree with any of that and then we'll loot their bodies just because we're in a keep does not mean we are safe we had jumanji oh sorry damn it let's all get some rest shall we do you owe some money i don't understand yes guards against scrying yes of course i don't know what they do but i'm raising my arm up who goes there who are you i've had a really bad day yo stoneskin's up dude i didn't get to say that shit and 20 wait is he casting that did he cast vanish sweet counterspell 4th-level too no (humming) what is this what i haven't gotten to do much today and you won't either okay can i see the broker where i am at now i doesn't matter i can see good enough i'm going to spend three sorcery points and heighten my spell which gives disadvantage on both those two rolls i'm going to cast a 5th-level fireball right on the cusp where it hits those two buttholes there it is that's what heighten spell does 17 all of them and then i'm going to spend one sorcery point to empower the spell and then i'm going to use the six and i'm going to choose one two three and four and five and six to re-roll empower spell is the only one that doubles with any other metamagic i can do it 46 (spellcasting sound effect) before he does that i go (laughing) i look over at keyleth and i use bonus action to cast misty step and i go right next to her and i vanish i make it but it's fire good instead of missing it i'm going to (swoosh gulps) swallow it (grunts) that's 20 my dex save was 20 sorry blowing smoke through my nose (snorts) and that's my turn it was very impressive good job grog that's my mother's name unless you invite them counterspell 5th-level fuck it 23 that was a wonderful toot scanlan where do i put this d10 doesn't matter cool i'm going to go as far as i can towards the old broad he hasn't taken any damage has he am i within 60 feet of the old lady that's pretty far still don't know whether i am or not okay i am within 120 right so what i'm going to do instead is i'm going to look down and i'm going to pull out my krull blade and i'm going to throw it in the air and cast telekinesis on it (spinning) and i'm going to go (swishing) and i'm going to huck it at the chick that's 31 six seven eight nine ten 11 12 13 and i'll bring it back to me i'll keep it hovering maintain the spell i'm going to bonus action misty
