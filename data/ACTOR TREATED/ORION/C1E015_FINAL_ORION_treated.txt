yeah crazed mercer matt abernathy did i say it right it's taurez thank you prometheus yes thank you prometheus are you in a broadway play are you seeing grease is that what's going on hello percy an airplane oh my god i could stand to wear it i have no torso armor cloth and leather i mean i just i can wear no armor i have this thing that somebody can use this would bring his-- with that and the ring if you wore this and the ring it would give you plus three to your ac so that's not a bad combo because this will give you plus one to your ac so who's going to take the ring that would bring you to 17 yes yes and also scanlan-- and i bring out the ioun stone like i was saying before you ran out of-- you kept running out of spells this allows you to store extra spells i propose a friendly trade for the crown-- circlet-- hat whatever you're wearing is it a circlet yes i think it would benefit you to have the ring some sort of spell storing which you've complained about running out of spells the last few times we've fought you know how i keep casting i keep hucking spells because i keep casting them out of my ioun stone you ran out of spells the last two battles and you said that i can't cast this anymore where you've-- or you can cast like three of those or three of those things that you would use for other deals i would like that very very much i had to no i-- no i was going to say you didn't turn me back into a mouse to be fair gnome i never abandoned the party at all i was surveying the situation my idea was not tried whatsoever so i merely kept to my word i did not enter the premises only when i needed to save everyone's life which is exactly what i did it's too big you're saying you can't wear it that's not clarota's thing that's a different thing right and we still have that like a bank shot i'm going too no you still have it wait i have a two part question gilmore i am oh everything's private i guess (laughter) 1750 oh that's good to know hmm yes no the ring of protection that i have is one measure i wanted it by another measure i don't know how to phrase this in rp so i wanted it to be-- to have-- oh very good i would like to arrange that man (quietly) that is insane we didn't buy it for that much did we i'll chill for now i will wait-- okay where there's two days to hang out i have an earring of the wind that i made that i have not enchanted yet can i enchant that in two days to make another one there is the existing functional one but over the time since i gave them out i only had time to make one extra one but i have to enchant them also ooh can i start it and then if we leave i can have one of the helpers-- oh okay well cool then i'll start that yeah i'll start doing the one that i made that's what we've got to do i'm going to miss that bit i'm still enchanting dude you've got to check your balanced dice man can we stop at-- is allura is she here or not and do we-- does she have helpers there when we were there do you remember it was just herself okay no it doesn't work like that i can bamf us back here when we're done how much does trinket weigh again like 600 pounds he's not over a thousand pounds though is it 800 pounds he's 800 pounds so i can fastball special him or a mace that's also bludgeoning nope no she has no interest in me i'm sure lady kima can satisfy any needs she has we can stop by there okay i only have a question we were about to depart on another adventure and whatnot and i was working on an enchantment on this particular-- i'll show her what it is it's an enchantment that's easily you know finished enough i was wondering if in our absence in your spare time you could probably put some time into finishing the enchantment whilst we're away oh just waiting there as well thank you so much allura it is-- (sputtering) well okay i'll bid you farewell and i'll do prestidigitation (pfft)-- a local flower i'll give to her for your trouble you're welcome who knew do you like me yes no maybe hello that is not true i am tiberius stormwind hello nice to meet you oh yeah i'll hold the thing up oh okay hold on a second we're putting this in the container right i put it inside the bag of holding real quick yes i'm going to take off a tiny piece of one of my tickets of telescription and i'm going to enchant it and i want to attempt to do an enchantment spell where-- i want to put it at the bottom of where i'm going to-- -- the box and if it's if any weight is lifted from it i'll know like if there's the old switcheroo somehow-- oh man because i would've used the troll dick instead okay it's a tiny piece of paper but fine if i can't do it then i just wanted to say i put it in there not yet it's okay so i put it in the thing kima i'm wondering who do we speak to who flies the ship if we could maybe we should ask if they could stop at kraghammer for a second we could drop in and get our money really quick you know yeah we can use the airship later on for stuff which is cool we have an airship air and ships that's true as they're doing this i want to go to the opposite end so i can get like-- because this is beautiful and i want to hold out my staff and i-- and i'm going to cast image capture-- yes it is in draconia getting all of them and the airship while they're doing it and the airship is in it too look everyone (laughs) i can totally do it winches can we do it like it's from 1993 are they out now oh cool how many days away are we now how many can you make i can spend the days crafting and then wouldn't i just need whatever gold that would be yeah because the enchantment's-- that's over there i'm just not doing anything else yeah airship oh i still have mine i can give you 400 i rush up to the bow i don't think i'm associated with these there's a big large one right though i cast blur before any of that shit i didn't get to say what i wanted to do 19 what color are the dragons yes okay i'm going to move over here i'm still in range of that guy right good i'm going to use telekinesis to lift the rider off and chuck him off so that's-- no but it's still okay that's 16 plus my this thing that's 19 and i turn to the wyvern and i go (speaking draconic) and i in dragon-speak or draconic whatever i say-- fight with me or be free or he can meaning-- right nope like eight yeah no i had advantage wait what marisha and how is that possible okay sorry no it's birds birds hate lightning shoot his wing off yay trinket so that thing went to go save his dude i turn to him super annoyed and i go (speaking draconian) and i use telekinesis and i rip off his wing the wyvern oh crap i don't do any of that stuff just pluck it this is annoying you what's going on who's this dude over here and this is the elven-- okay oh let's see how many between the two how many-- what's the distance between-- what's this thing right here oh that's fun okay i'm going to use my movement to get around over here-- because that's all 60 feet right ah cool well then i'll use-- screw it i'll use telekinesis to pick up that elf and huck it right into the ballista ooh natural 20 (cheering) yeah marisha and i still do that i lift him up and do that instead cool that's my turn it's fine yay rage nope hit it okay i take my staff-- -- push myself up i'll-- i don't know guys i don't-- get rid of the wyvern okay i'm going to-- first i'll do telekinesis again to attempt to do what i did the first time nothing fancy because whatever and i'll try and rip off the wyvern's wings again from his body or one of them if it's easier that is 22 that'll be nine ten yeah ten and i see that and i turn to vax and i go i like what you were doing earlier and i spend five sorcerer points i cast telekinesis again and i take out eight of the daggers that are in my pouch and i hover them around me and then i start (stabbing noises) towards the wyvern where i see all the bone shit is and i'm hucking my-- back and forth bringing them back and forth oh i don't it's just going oh well then fucking that's what's going on and i spend five to do it again because can i do that all in one action do that and then with the daggers that's okay so i did it right yeah so got it yeah and i'm pulling them back and forth through that tear in the wing which i just caused four times so my attack modifier is the spell attack bonus is that what i want that's 23 24 25 26 and that's-- what is that yeah and then 18 plus-- that's 30 31 32 because i get plus three on all attacks because of the gear i'm wearing also and then seven plus that is 18 21 and then that is 15 17 18 so my spell attack bonus is 11 plus three because of all the gear i have on on top of those that goes to my spell attack bonus which is what this is right so how do i have-- oh i'm sorry i'm counting this in so minus one from all those totals that's-- three 13 eight eight okay yeah 28 as i see this i'm going to just hover all the daggers over the prone dude and right over his face to keep him there that's an eight that's d10 yes that's ten your armor class is 17 your armor class is 17 yeah he's had a plus two and the armor plus three to his ac which was 14 so that's 17 shoot that load percy damn it i wasn't-- as he says that i hover the daggers if you wish to live answer our giant friend who asked you a rather polite question are we in agreement we are saving this one i cast prestidigitation on the little halfling and clean her up real quick i was mainly working on the smell a proper bath will be better but--
