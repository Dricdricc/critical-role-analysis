favorite issues of excalibur and i crapped my pants i have four of yours joe in my box right now at home he's an amazing guy and awesome thing to back check it out please that means convention i'm going to get a hot dog i would like to announce that i feel pretty good i know but maybe that's why i feel so good i'll get shunned for it happening then i'm like oh cool i don't have to worry about me right now what time of the day is it pardon what is the total of the staff's payment i'll pay him in advance right now just to get it out of the way 600 out of here phew there you go when they start to go i'd like to go to the temple with the sigils and talk to the guy who runs the place yeah yeah because i learned something new this week and i was like i'm dumb but that's where i would like to head (whispers) don't forget the bolt matthew i took some fine meats before i left and i'm feeding them to lockheed along the way stupid (laughs) why would you say that i didn't do anything yes hi if you do not remember me i am tiberius stormwind from draconia moreover vox machina over at greyskull keep well we told you multiple times before we met with you using your sigil of teleport-- it's fine i've come here on a matter of business anyway so that's neither here nor there i was wondering if i may procure an address or number as it were for a sigil to kraghammer i believe the thunderbrands would have some facility near theirs or on their own premises where their sigil could be channeled through the circle of teleportation spell where is he i thought that was you hi i'm tiberius stormwind from draconia moreover vox machina over at greyskull keep i was wondering-- and i asked your clerk here because i thought he did what you actually do here-- if i may procure for coin or perhaps some kind of favor of sorts the address or number or code or whatever it is that would work for the kraghammer sigil of my circle of teleportation okay where is he can you take me to him where is he at hello orion and moreover vox machina over at greyskull keep here in emon we are the saviors of this town and whatnot anyway that's neither here nor there i went through this fellow who i thought was the job of this fellow but it wasn't either of those jobs it was you who i've been needing to talk to i'm assuming i'm hoping to procure an address or access to the sigils of kraghammer through my circle of teleportation spell and whatnot using your arcane gates that's about it (laughter) yes yes we'll have to speak with them as well we've got things for you this time like we said we would get for you in the underdark it's really inconvenient but we have things that we need to get to you quickly he was drinking he's an alcoholic he's got help since then what is it 20 (in same accent as matt) of course oh sorry i started to sound like you (laughter) of course i wouldn't expect you to i'm tiberius stormwind from draconia my father kruvanis stormwind has helped the council for over two generations we come from a noble house and i give you my word that i will never abuse-- abuse-- however you pronounce it in your tongue the privilege of quickly traveling to your stead to do business with you and there would be no other intrusion otherwise i guarantee it as my name as a stormwind that's 11 ooh we found one a couple yes and we killed a bunch of those buttholes i don't have it on me right now it's fine headmaster i'll be back in about 15 minutes with the proper proof that we did procure the things that the man that needed to have proof did excuse me and i get the hell out of there and as soon as i get out of there i cast fly on myself and i gandalf (whoosh) right back to the keep well travis is my target right are you still at the keep she's full of sass those are masterwork daggers it's me you idiots i'm in a hurry sorry (whoosh) i go into i rush in to find him eating (stammers) quickly quickly and i go into the bag of holding and i take the item out that we need what was it i can't because i have to visualize what it is to pull it out i've taken my hand out when we were in the underdark and one of the items that we procured while we were scavenging and we looted it and we could give it back to the thunderbrand yes and we found one or two of them i don't have it we didn't give it to them that's what i reach in and grab there you go keyleth i mean your highness i like your hair it looks cool i take it out and i put it in mine grog i'm finding out a way as soon as i can show this to you fellow i'm going to go into kraghammer very very fast as opposed to slowly and it is so we should leave right now yeah and i'll cast-- because who was around just them two i cast fly again at 3rd or 4th level to cast on them yes but we get there much faster if we fly and i go you can stay ooh that gives me a wonderful idea and then i'll cast it at 4th level again and i'll go (pew-pew) and cast it on-- right come on follow me what about my circlet i cast fly again at 6th-level on everybody else no because i can catch everybody you fall in the kitchen though yes it's the same spell i just really need a nap after this i really need a nap after this i go back to gather them all yes can we not talk to the middle guy first can we go right to the last guy thank you very much follow me everybody wonderful that makes me quite happy yes but i do not want to use that favor for that sigil i would like to call our friends and i brought the item i bring out the amulet i want to show our friends in kraghammer that we actually brought them the thing to get their permission to go on their sigil and the other continent that we were on is called what yes the favor i would like for gilmore is to get the vasselheim sigil please but let's contact our friends at kraghammer first using my mage hand i'm like it's one of the things that you wanted us to get i can see it it's fine what does it say keyleth oh sorry to lorna with love as he's doing this i'm writing the sigil that i'm seeing forming in my-- shall we go collect our money now sam and everybody's here but grog wait where are you oh you're working tinkering okay thunderbrands are buttholes though yeah is that what you want to do is that what's going on oh shit no actually i need to sleep all that flying left me a bit exhausted well hold on maybe there's a way i could trigger the spell let's get a drink maybe it's only been a day what time of the day is this it's still afternoonish right great my swallow's been crafted at the other place right has that happened already i'm calling it swallow on the way back because we're obviously going to leave in the morning to do stuff i'd like to quickly stop at any blacksmith i see on the way back to greyskull keep okay i go to the good one not the bad one per reputation i'll go to her because she's awesome yes i'm tiberius stormwind from draconia moreover from vox machina-- oh sorry right we've done business before i would like to commission you and as i'm doing this i'm taking out five of my daggers that i have and i'm going to hand them to her i would like to commission you to somehow craft these daggers into a type of bended glaive if you would i don't know how long it would take you to do so you see it's like it would look like this but it's-- yeah totally but the blades are bended but they're all connected in the center you could use an iron or a steel ingot to connect the-- wonderful 100 gold pieces what that's all i mean oh yes of course here's 120 i trust your work trinket's armor was fantastic did she do that i thought that was the same character bear's armor the bear's armor was-- his name is trinket i'm surprised she didn't tell you it's an adorable name this is lockheed i do business with her and i go back to the keep yes sorry prestidigitation i would like to fart natural 20 is it possible to before i go to sleep i have a basic poison potion i've been hoarding could i try to dip the tip of one of my bolts in that on bolts you're not a chinchilla grog which is a small creature that bathes itself in dust but you are a human which water is good well you are a humanoid which is water is good which most of you is water no it feels rather-- i'm feeding lockheed some of my breakfast i'm going to i rolled i'm going to do a roll for the day i think i rolled one for the day and i'm going to go staht staht and i'm going to i rolled a 14 to try to teach it to sit staht and i give it a treat krar krar there you go as it's hanging i put it on my shoulder as i'm having my oatmeal and such i start to cast light (whoosh) i cast it on lockheed on his tail oh bensvelk that means good in draconian bensvelk and i feed him a treat yes of course vex they know we're coming i showed them the amulet it was how we got the sigil to come here to begin with it's fine we're doing business with them it'll be good i'm sorry we thought you would like a night's sleep before we intrude and-- i'll open the bag of holding and i'll take it out before i actually go over and speak i'm going to turn to scanlan and vex is he the same person who pays us for the other-- i just didn't want to say the wrong thing this time oh sorry here is the amulet and i show him now as far as trade as it was rather taxing to procure this particular artifact-- yes she's correct i was wondering if we could perchance trade it for a favor of your arcane ability that was just to get me here quicker i thought no not at all here's what happened see we were on an adventure-- i pull out the carpet out of my bag of holding and this carpet was enchanted once with the ability to fly and it helped us many times in many adventures it was de-chanted i guess if you want to say it and we need it re-chanted and i thought that house thunderbrand would be a strong enough house to have the ability to do such a thing maybe not as it seems and i hand him the amulet as i'm saying this and not as a trade but as a favor for just the effort or maybe because i'm not strong enough as a sorcerer myself to do it yes i completely stayed away from it because i was terrified i start going back to the chamber and i'll do the spell again no it's a 5th-level spell yeah it's a 5th-level spell yes very well and then we'll go back to-- i'll choose emon as this is going on i want to turn to scanlan and go gnome i have an idea that i want to run by you no your name's scanlan okay i was going to go and do this just on a whim as i usually do but i was thinking that we should speak to allura and i don't think i should speak to her alone yes you know like i told vax you just have to chill out sometimes and i'm like well maybe i should run it by the man with the mouth yes this is more business rather than denied pleasure well as far as i see it there's no other way to get our carpet reenchanted i want to confess what we did to her and hopefully she takes mercy and helps us out with this as we've helped her out far beyond anything that-- vex no vex yes stand over-- and i use my still image and take a little spell of her-- no but it's of her it's a youie oh and i open my scroll of telescription i'm like see vex i give her the picture now you have a picture of your bear with the silly bows ooh yes i would like the same thing how many days have passed since we've been doing this two all we can do is get gear and do things and we can sleep for a few days i think we'll be fine because i have privilege perk oh sure here no (laughter) (unintelligible mumbling) it's effective for brevity i rolled six dice i rolled the only high ones worth mentioning was a 13 a 15 and 18 17 i mean and the because they're all negative three and i attempted to teach to lockheed to hide and speak and to stay oh and i've picked up my glaive right two days it was time to krull i'm naming it krull and i attach it to my coat i do it as well i don't know what's going on yes it's not water grog and i keep casting it on him it's fine see (splash) what's wrong with what you're wearing now oh so i'll go and i'll use some of my dust of illusion and i'll (pfft) on what he's wearing and shape it into a fancier robe and i notice this i go oh oh grog and i use a little bit more of dust of illusion i wipe it smear it on there no stop hey hey hey-- i put it on actually i'm going to take it and i'm going to actually put it in your hand and be like-- put it on your thumb and be like i want you to smear this where the beard was and i want you to think really hard that you want it there okay so put it on first there you go that's it and now think really hard that you want it there yes you need to go down here well i'm tiberius stormwind from draconia (chuckles) of course i just need to know that one's happening so it's tricky is what i'm saying somebody would have to have rather powerful abilities to see through an illusion spell like a disguise or such it's like a rakshasa could see though that kind of thing per experience i doubt that the briarwoods have any-- would you like me to cast fireball see she can see it you look gorgeous allura and my friends are just making weird faces right now it's probably because of how beautiful you look i flirt with allura i flirt with her throughout the hour actually towards the end of that conversation i would like to bring up a specific thing we've been having such a wonderful conversation i think when things settle down a bit perhaps you and i and maybe grog and lady kima can perhaps go out break bread and have some wine and such on an evening with each other i believe my friend rather fancies kima what say you well of course if it was awkward nobody wants that oh just you and i okay all right wonderful i walk away (laughter) oh can i sit at the far end of the table at the very opposite end if not at head of the end-- oh who oh not that chair yes that would be rude i think i'm from draconia we're pretty cool they were running around they got diarrhea isn't that what you said i was just going to ask you seem such a lovely couple do you have any children that is so courageous of you do you want me to fireball her now gesundheit is allura there still as we're eating i'm going to by the way did you ever perhaps finish making that extra earring i gave you several weeks ago i don't know how long it's been i had no idea i'll send someone oh wonderful thank you that's-- so talented what flavor tea do you like allura noted i walk away you said walk away i want to do an arcana check on them if they're armed with anything that has arcane properties got you standard gear we befriended it it betrayed us and then we killed it vex is so into showing people our city (gulping) i'm having a little do you want dessert now would you like this fireball creme brulee i know a particular spell that it's rather wonderful and i go blow a stream out and do a cantrip control magic and start doing a nice dragon fire dance that i know of from my home have a wonderful rest if he does an action it dissipates the spell it's not greater invisibility so he goes uninvisible when he does something no i never have i can actually say that never put myself in danger except for the illithid never put myself in danger the fire thing now granted i didn't know how fireball worked at the time i'm just saying
