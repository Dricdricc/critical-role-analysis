thing that i can like start to do hourly for a long long time okay i'm going to start that process right now no let's sleep it off i see vex's condition and i run out to get her a coffee from the bazaar and then do my perception check on the thing oh as i'm running by because the coffee's hot hot oh excuse me would you happen to have any particular dragonites for sale male preferably but i

warhorse for sale for that price can we get the two for 400 i'll take one full price i won't bargain how much extra for some side saddles these are my personal of course i would not want to upset you again milady vex i have missed your company light (igniting sound) oh (snuffing sound) i'm going to cast light under one of the flaps of my robe (igniting sound) (igniting sound) i'll cast it under that and you can be the source of light now you look really cool i'm going to roll real quick i was going to do animal handling that's the roll animal handling every day so i can train it to do stuff so i didn't gain a point today and i take out the decanter of endless water-- water anybody-- and then i'm feeding lockheed some so to take a long rest i take can one hour or two hours to still have a long rest and do stuff so an hour before that i'm starting to enchant the staff oh bananas feed lockheed that wasn't a word so how should we approach apparently your people have a taste for the theatrics maybe they will be too you know maybe they just like being warm and i assume they are steeped in tradition as well such as your own people oh i see i'm going to reach in my-- dust of illusion and-- (laughter) it's okay it didn't break it happens all the time when you bend it it's fine we're all okay and i just sprinkle some on myself and i turn my scales silver this is the color my brother faeryn is if they are steeped in tradition the metallic dragonkin are more welcome in societies more than the chromatic as we've seen i have this longbottom herb you can smoke before we go 13 sure (igniting sound) 18 22 i rolled an 18 because i want to do an arcana check for anything i can feel from that storm how big is the boulder can i try to do something right now can i try and do something i'm going to try to cast telekinesis and (whoosh) so now we see that happening cool so as i see the next one i cast telekinesis on the one he's about to throw and huck it right back at him okay that was 15 nope got a solid five that's 24 is my thing still going i'm going to catch one and (whoosh) no i'm going to whack the dude 19 no i'm going to huck it right back to the other guy again (swish whoosh) that's 14 a hidden valley this feels great to me i'm stretching out my scales letting the heat in oh yeah that's good lady keyleth is that you oh it's-- as they are doing this with their noses i'm going to open my bottle of air and just have it (soft spraying sound) that is a negative two there see what (light sound effect) sorry i think a fireball can do this-- no i'm just kidding i don't bow i'm still at her side yes your highness hi i'm tiberius stormwind kin so what now your highness we won't let that happen i cast stoneskin (whoosh) just to note when i cast stoneskin i didn't do the concentration i let go of the alter self oh (pop) 21 do you need me to light that on fire again for you 15 15 hey internet there's my natural one laura and suck it it happens (laughs) resist 13 for me anyway and i'm like oh that tickles i don't expend an action to do that and instead i look at the main dude and i'm going to be like here's something she taught me (babbling) and i use a scroll and i'm going to cast blight (magic sound) on him i have two blight scrolls i'm reading super fast (babbling) it's okay i have something else that's effective it's 22 as i'm going to do that i'm going to heighten it and spend three sorcerer points so it gives him disadvantage-- fair enough 17 so what i can do is i can-- if i can't heighten an initial spell i can power a spell that's already been cast with my sorcerer's point right you can empower a spell (counting) 25 damage where am i relative to everybody else okay cool what i will do because i can do this is i will quicken spell and i will spend two sorcery points to misty step behind where vex is (whoosh) yep and in view of everybody else where i can still cast stuff that's my turn yes pike you're swirling water around him right now okay i'm going to scooch my booch closer to the wall to get quarter cover i think that'll put me in about where i need to be to see all three of them scooch my boocher two three four okay so i'm going to cast-- two four six-- glacial blast (hiss) in the arc to hit all three of them 30 feet if i have to move can i move closer to hit i'll take the two i'll do that and then i'm going to spend three points to heighten the spell and that gives them disadvantage on their saving throw so i'm going to do that right now 17 yeah if they save ten 18 what's that 30 35 35 and that was at disadvantage oh no it must be stopped and i turn to the fire elemental because they're coherent right i'm like do you really need me to do this i ask it the question fine so i go glacial blast with my finger (hiss) 17 14 32 and i will use two sorcery points to quicken a spell and use my cantrip control flame to (whoosh) start juggling the flame that i was caught on fire with (laughter) would somebody end this please i think we should go yes 19 14 one i have water (spraying) it's mainly for drinking and such but are we all done yes i rather enjoyed that environment myself
