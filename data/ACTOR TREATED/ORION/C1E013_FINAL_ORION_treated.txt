we love you kit who are you who do you guys play son of a bitch yeah whatchamacallit a few weeks ago me and matthew wore these really cool shirts with the vermilion bird from rubrum which is in type-0 the final fantasy that we're both in that shirt was made from greven g-r-e-v-e-n at redbubble and we wanted to thank him for those shirts along with this awesome final fantasy shirt made by august8913 where she did this super cool it says nine on the back his says trey thank you guys for the really cool shirts who'd you play you were kreoss by the way war machine tactics matthew mercer is kreoss yeah yeah check it out thank you everyone i could have sam fart on this for you if you want sorry okay i forgot to ask you something before the game it's fine pike-- do you have spell of restoration the thing that can reverse stone clarota what do you suggest we do do we stay do we leave or do we-- what do you there are hundreds upon thousands of illithid rushing at us right now and they don't like me very much by the way-- very good wait do you want her un-stoned or still stoned this is exactly what has to do with the horn is there any way pike could you perhaps half-cast it and hold the spell don't quite undo her legs from stone i don't want her to be mobile i want to ask her-- we will discuss that when we get out of here i am with you to be fair scanlan i never disappeared to begin with quite the contrary if it wasn't for me you'd still be fighting that damn thing silence (laughter) counterspell no you're done you're quiet the idea which i will share-- we don't have time to do that-- he has to say that it doesn't work so the idea is pike if we ask her why she wants the horn if there is any other reason but to destroy it we have to-- the idea is if she doesn't want to destroy it i say there's something awful and keyleth i believe you want to destroy it yes i know this is did you say orcus is that his name this thing is no good at all where is some lava i would much like to do that but she wanted to take it back to emon that is not appropriate we need to destroy this i dispel silence sorry i just wanted to get the point across i'm staying up can i not-- oh then i'd be down there oh i have a wonderful escape plan no no stop no don't it's fine it's fine it's fine and it's at the halfway point between where she is and where i'm standing yeah right there it's really heavy guys don't do anything i'm saying this on the ears natural 20 it's 23 it doesn't work like that it's what i was trying to say earlier 19 yes i like that idea not while we're still in it we'll talk about it later plan b it's ten minutes sure no don't look at it you said one minute that's the dm dm is god oh yes i'm so glad i'm wrong how many of us are down there now sometimes fighting isn't the right thing to do yeah okay-- this isn't good how far scanlan's only like a foot away from me right i'm right next to him oh shit okay i cast fly on myself i redact that actually is it possible-- i'm at least standing next to him right i don't have to use a move action right now i can like look at him okay can i give him-- can i take off my ioun stone as an action and swap his crown but he didn't he hasn't attuned himself to the thing yet yeah how long does it take shit okay that changes everything in a very bad way okay so i'm going to attempt to crush the horn with a thousand pounds of pressure because my telekinesis is still going i can't do anything else without dropping this thing because as soon as i do anything else i drop the horn so i have to do that first what am i adding oh 23 i thought so i'm going to-- i'm going to maneuver around the chaos because i'm not within range of anybody to hurt me right so i'm going to hop on the carpet well i can run oh that's stupid hey percy (laughs) that's my turn that's all i can do and i still maintain the thing fuck you couch isn't there a rope still hanging from there throw the damn rope nope 17 man boom plus your strength oh it doesn't matter oh awesome friendly fire so i rush up and percy takes off seeing what's going on-- there's an illithid right behind me right so i'm running off and then percy takes off so i can't get to him awesome i need a technical question can i move the horn and let go of the spell so i can then do my turn or does that take a thing to do that like i want to let it go-- good so as i'm running up to the carpet i see percy go and i'm like (growls) damn tiamat-lover so i bring over the horn and right at the tip on the carpet i let it go you deal with it then i don't give it to percy i let it land on the carpet i see the-- oh god okay i can only do this once i see the-- they're not inside yet right awesome okay that is a-- and this is a-- okay right i have-- i blow everything i'm going to blow everything you cannot resist as i leave the horn there i turn to where the door is obelisk of stone i seal up the entryway well how wide is it like 15 feet great i only need one right okay so i seal that one-- i'm going to use all three right now i'll seal the other one and i'll use the other one on myself and i'm going to use-- i only have three left yeah okay and i'm going to use my last three sorcerer points that i have and i have zero points after this and i'm going to cast blur on myself and that's my turn except me it's going to come in handy now pick up vax i said vax yes it's fine it's good that they're up there pick her up don't do that yes yeah get on trinket yeah get out what's the order after me okay okay good i cast fly at 5th level i cast it on myself i cast it on grog and i cast it on-- you're not there trinket (groans) yeah me and i (flying noise) um outside i dunno it's right here it's right here the cards look at the cards it's 60 feet oh wait hold on-- i want to turn to to everybody and go fly you fools that's right pike bury it deep inside get on the bear you never wash it to begin with you can fly grog head to the beach well he has to wait for the carpet i do not have the necessary item to do two concentration spells at once and inspiration here you go boss ooh i took notice of this did you say there was illithid coming up on the sides too okay i turn to the group i suggest we go to the beach immediately there we can shore up defenses and i can cast a spell and get us out of here as i say that i go (fwwt) and throw a fireball right at that fucker's head no i'm up top i have fly on myself yeah i just let a fireball down on the brain 40 my movement by the way is i head to the beach yes as long as i'm thinking about it you did can he add it now it's hulking trinket and vex are still there like the macy's day parade can she take control of the carpet too i want to make a note because i'm way ahead of everybody at this point as soon as i land on the beach i cast circle of teleportation barring that there's nobody there but i do that immediately by the blessings of bahamut i choose emon i run right through that was something now wasn't it we are safe hold on just one second we still have the horn to deal with i think we should get it out of her view before-- we can store it there the way circle of teleportation works is when i learned it i get to pick two locations that i know innately i picked emon as one of them but i just had to pick the two i'll use telekinesis to lift the horn off the carpet yeah i can burn one from my ioun stone i cast dispel magic on scanlan yeah i do no counterspell and i silenced you this is dispel magic which ends your spell he's friendly yeah i'm tiberius stormwind how are you i'm responsible for casting the spell to get us here to begin with gatekeeper greyskull keep i'm glad you held that the whole time we were down there grog actually hold on a minute let's all rest before we deal with this one she doesn't have a sense of time she won't know i was fine [dramatic music] greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called ty'rex located in the heart of draconia from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerer's rite showing prodigy-like control of my magic the judges and the draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member as it's rather boring however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time no oh i mean in real life yeah i was like don't touch it is it dark right now i cast light it's us i stand up and i head towards the sleeping quarters and i just say leave her to stone tonight we'll deal with it tomorrow and i go to bed hold on a sec i can still cast as an animal right oh i still go to bed (laughter) in between my pillow did they wake me up okay i'm trying to bite grog i am not happy why did you wake me up i was so comfy being furry (laughter) i was so soft have i rested what's going on what the fuck (laughter) oh the horn of orcus this thing comes from a devil a demon nothing good could ever come from anything it made in existence it needs to be destroyed and i'm sorry let me articulate these words a little bit more there is nothing that you can use this particular artifact for any reason of good the fact that it is even here is a very bad sign because it was taken from one of these beasts that's exactly what we need to do i don't think they wanted to bring it back because there is-- the liquid hot magma that was below where it was being held was very sufficient for it to be thrown in no pike could destroy it give yourself a little bit more credit you killed a dragon laura and no if it could be a permanent banishment yes but we don't know what kind of plane and what creatures lie there that would perhaps come upon that artifact what are the elements fire burns earth light destroys darkness pike you're the only one who-- exactly scanlan you're the only one who could-- if your weapon had any kind of light enchantment on them could probably smash this thing to bits then we would have to scatter the remnants the pieces far from each other if not find different ways to destroy those pieces because it comes from something that would-- because they wanted to bring it somewhere where they-- i don't know which is why i wanted you to do the half thing where we could question kima without her attacking us or trying to attempt to take the horn from us i like that plan too allura is somebody who should not be here when this conversation happens because if they turn south she's a more powerful sorcerer than i grog is there nothing else in that bag of holding do you want it very far away in the keep how about just stay in the keep i did leave a little rat turd before i got scooped out just so you know oh yes i'm going to bed i like being furry that's fine have your fun tonight people you will have your licking in the morning i go to sleep i woke up and took a dirt bath huh i know in lizard form in my form scales you rub it off with clay i have a little dirt in my room i can it's telekinesis i can picture it and-- no i don't do it i'm assuming it's there i'm not doing that right now i'm pretty sure it's there i'm going to cast circle of teleportation in my room no i'm going to go to the treasury first i'm going to take out 500 gold pieces and then i'm going to go to my room and cast circle of teleportation by the blessing of bahamut i choose draconia i would've had your back by the way there yes bonertown oh the dagger dude it's a dagger i got this amazing tiberius pin pike ashley a three-inch figure of pike is coming for you and a three-inch figure of scanlan is coming they're on their way david a dragon-bone die for the dragonborn good job guys oh my god is that your die that you got
