actually hosting geek and sundry on my channel right now yeah i do thank you oh cheer up vax she'll be back soon i've never seen you quite so down yes it's implying that someone has died and no one has so you know i agree stormwinds should not be meddling around with these peasants are we in a tavern barkeep bring me your finest ale for my friend here and for the lady i'll take a water and i flip him a couple of gold coins i have one don't forget that i'm good on potions but we should restock our supply i have let me see here three potions of greater healing and three regular potions of healing i suppose if we're just going to buy more it doesn't matter but just in case something happens along the way yes so we'll go buy more and then we'll see what else they have i would like to see if we can procure a couple of items like a couple of empty vials i've used a lot of mine maybe find some acid or whatnot at these item shops so let's look around and get the stuff he's saying he left with the flying carpet keyleth he left with it we don't have it i held it for a time but i only have my wheel of mending in mine as far as i know hold on let me check i'm thinking really hard hold on oh here it is shut my mouth i guess i was wrong 16 i approach yes i still don't know what that means but i am actually happy to see you milady yes yes there is you mentioned before when i asked you last of the boros ring you revealed that it was in the fey the wild fen i am also in search of the item that i did not get to ask you about called the pale stone i wish to know the location of that as well since you're not in the business of information then we are in the business of procuring some specific items potions i'm looking for a few empty glass vials perhaps some acid if you have it you don't have to be all nasty about it i have the money here you go yes i know something bad is going to happen i show them the box i take it and pick it up this is all she had to offer she's not taking questions she does that vax a lot yes good day madam what did we actually get i'm going to give you another one of the greater potions so mark that down so we should go there yes and usually i'm the cranky one so let's head to the temple right yes can you turn into a horse i'm just asking oh the take what would make you feel better that was that one carpenter we met in in vasselheim yes he did he sure knew how to-- it was dank they'll be fine i'm sure of it scanlan makes good decisions all the time listen don't be smug with me none of us what to be here or cooperate with this stupid event just to abide your laws the answer is yes let's get on with it oh well thank you can we use the word liaison yes she is i am tiberius stormwind ah a religious man hello i'm tiberius stormwind yes yes she is it grows on you though oh they're a fun group would this be an arcana or this be a history check i'm going to do an arcana check 18 this seems to be bothering you kashaw it's going to say the same thing which part well dwarf why don't you do your title and lead then and i should warn you you are walking with a stormwind you may not know my name but i can assure you i alone am an army so we are well protected so lead us to find this tiger-man please wind people call me tibsy well i mean rakshasa does sound fun rakshasa no it gets better it's a demon thorbir is what they meant to say that's true we've seen that okay what am i doing with this sand yes i agree you did the fancy spell i'm assuming there's no stables around so i don't get all dirty hammertime oubliette what say you thorbir yes i like that phrasing that's actually a good idea as well did you say this was the bahamut part of town too yes i would agree great do you have potions are you all potioned up are you good on items thorbir i'm just fine well let's go talk to one then shall we yes kashaw very well 20 hold on everybody calm down hi i'm tiberius stormwind my friend thorbir here didn't mean to offend of course fair enough wil and scanlan have you been talking to scanlan he likes whores okay it's weird is there a way that the bastions could organize some kind of gathering of sorts perhaps a mandatory town meeting where all would have to gather for maybe an announcement or something official may we seek audience with this raven queen oh she's not here we're new around here i'm sure quite a few and if we could pinpoint when it actually started we know years but actually when then we can actually narrow it down to the establishments and other things that were established then or the owner himself yes oh i agree i cast alter self on myself and turn myself into an elf you're half-elf right i'll turn into a half-elf akin to a high-born half elf you look okay he's just stealthing she does that just agree i think it's maybe because you're not his sister and it would be weird because that's his sister's name but she's a female life lessons yes are we on our way there now now i change i change because it only lasts a certain amount of time i'm a boy i say it's equally-- no it's fine now i cast alter self wait vax what was my role in this financial advisor excellent i approach right next to vax as we move up scanlan in draconic i go greetings and salutations friend not yet we are new to this place my master here is seeking audience with his kind we were guided to this place this establishment has a high reputation we wish to inquire how to get inside oh not elvish but more people of high society high society here 21 may we seek audience with him to ask or apply or however that goes about in dwarvish i say that's correct your wonderful employees mentioned membership we'd like to acquire that as well i assume as well thorlaxalux at your service i bow gracefully what is that 16 i know many languages i was a bit of a shut-in as a child all i had were books on languages to read and whatnot and adventures and what have you as she finishes that i dispel alter self my apologies i am tiberius stormwind-- yes wind i merely dispelled this to show you that earning your trust is in our best interests i do not wish to deceive many people don't take kindly to a red dragonborn by the way i just thought it was best we're in a new town and it was standard protocol whenever we visit a new town my apologies we're fairly sure you know of this you calm down i'm going to approach him and i'm going to cast mage hand i'm going to have it float right up in front of me i'm like now you better start cooperating because it seems to me that you're getting very nervous and we don't want to do anything nor do we want to leave all we want is information i guess we want to know what you want to know too we want a lot of information so start talking and stop acting like a fool 15 i disperse the magic hand more calm there we go thank you where are they we fought a beholder before and we could protect you from them or it as we said it as i see her do this i open the scroll of polymorph i do polymorph on myself and i turn myself into a gadfly and follow as a gadfly can i really quickly buzz in front of him how far away is he from me how far away is the guard in front of him oh god we have a map okay so he's right there oh so i'm within 20 feet of him whatever okay ah i'm going to dispel polymorph and i'm going to cast silence in front of him i'm going to silence him yes yes i believe so sorry what is that 17 i'm going to cast telekinesis and grab him that way it's the rakshasa that's him no i yell at you don't chase him but she can hear me and i'm not that far you heard me the other way the other way and i move in the room with these guys the rakshasa nothing works on him and i think that's not normal yes sorry rakshasa i believe the dwarf is the rakshasa i cast many things and keyleth is in there nothing hit him can i see what's going on where'd you say the guards came from what was that guy's name lohan hosin i just disperse silence and before i go out i turn into hosin alter self how did he sound again i don't remember oh right right what's all this noise out here what are you bothering my friends for guards everything's fine these are friends get on with your business get back on patrol make sure nothing happens or i'll have your heads 28 go on get out if we've stopped pursuing does that take us out of initiative thorbir do you have an extra sword or arm on you perhaps a shortsword as he's doing that i'm going to drink a potion of frost giant strength with his jeweled dagger i take out my dagger i feel great should i do a perception on that nope oh i'll motion over there before we go down i'm going to take off my outer-- no i can't take off anything because that's all my gear never mind i don't do that but before we go down i cast stoneskin on myself i cast that right now even though i'm still a dwarf though as he's milling about light dagger because i have two daggers in my hands sorry i usually just do it when it's dark i'll follow i'll keep on thorbir's six i'll stay 15 feet behind him i mean well done rogue i dispel alter self immediately so i have longer-ass legs it's been 15 minutes time has passed never mind i don't do shit i cast fly on myself and fly oh as i'm flying i turn around with my ring and i cast slow on the boulder damn it i gandalf it oh awesome is it at least ten to 15 feet away from me sweet as i'm now frustrated i cast a 5th-level spell and i will cast my obelisk of iron three in a row behind me that should stop it right there i keep gandalfing as i see this happening i run over and go like this looks like a lot of fun oh has ten minutes passed i thought ten minutes it only lasts for like ten minutes yeah i go this looks like a lot of fun and i go and i slide my dex was 18 by the way i put up my nose scales i'm laughing by the way as we land i look around oh that was a lot of fun i cast prestidigitation three times in a row and clean us all up or at least our faces you're making it worse now it's smoky and smells prestidigitate it out of my face oh shit i go invisible yeah all this and again thank you for doing this because portions of this goes to an amazing charity and we love all
