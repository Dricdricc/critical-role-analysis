shit i turn back and head to the group what don't speak to me in that manner i am tiberius stormwind 18 i understand that and i am sorry for losing my temper i was just looking to ask questions of particular artifacts i have been looking for and this house is the only known arcane house i know that i was pointed to i tried to reach them and communicate but i was stopped by the stupid rune i can't figure out i was turning back to get my tavern to get some rest and come back and try to contact the family the next day then i was stopped by you 24 i mean yes my hearing is perfectly fine good day back to the tavern i'm at the balcony by the way watching all this i'm taking a short rest you all can do this i'm having an ale while watching all this yeah and i'm like this is fog probably keyleth's spell (like marisha) i'm a bear i'm going to cast prestidigitation and do fireworks on top of that can i do little hats no i'll try paper hat greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called ty'rex located in the heart of draconia born from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerer's rite showing prodigy-like control of my magic the judges and the draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member as it's rather boring however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for months i would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever i found those answers to be unacceptable a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms going from town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a red dragonborn i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed so i could explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there some may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most give me credit for i just don't pay attention to things sometimes i've also been known to be rather cunning loyal happy-go-lucky and well dangerous i can't help but show my true scales every now and then but overall i think i'm quite friendly for a dragonborn i didn't certainly not i just couldn't get in the door rather rude what i thought is that i could cover the rune with ice and merely step over it i didn't think it would dissolve my ice yes a good sorcerer always all his tricks before turning around which is what i did i think we should go back there because i feel that it's significant that i couldn't get in so easily i would not do that again almost she shot off the penis don't you remember vax i was almost raped by trolls oh my name is tiberius kraghammer (laughter) shoot we're in kraghammer right oh stronghammer i meant--i meant stronghammer kraghammer is my father's cousin's side i've been
