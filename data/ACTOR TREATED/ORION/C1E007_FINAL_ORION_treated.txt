fail maybe they went to sleep wait didn't we see further past that 'cause that's where grog did the-- (crushing noise) yes natural 20 now as that happens i want to cast mage hand and i want to cast light on it and i want to slowly have it drift down there dagnabbit dagnabbit okay fine instead i cast prestidigitation and i make a little glowy orb and it's a little flickery and i cast-- i think i can maybe try what 15 feet no to my left i wanna see in the dark place hm all right well i follow after the bear (laughter) matthew behind the bear yes no no the other bear i mean the other side of the bear i wave at them hello i don't think they're our friends what was that right pike but man that was rough pointer face i scootch up ahead of grog like excuse me excuse me i'm going to make my way around all this riff-raff uh no uh yes i'm going to go past where vax is in the room down that hallway then i'm going to do my mage hand thingy again oh my prestidigitation mm-hm slowly five feet by five feet i just stop and i creep back they don't see me right oh i'll cast blur instead i'm not going to count that oh i'll count that 19 (laughter) because it flew out of my hand i didn't roll it yeah (laughter) nope 17 yes no 17 hits as everybody is doing this i'm going to-- why are you blocking me i'm not supposed to be this close to this thing keep going oh like i was saying well shit okay i'll just lift up my hand and go firebolt okay okay 20 okay ten 18 20 21 23 as my bonus action i'm gonna spend two sorcery points and do it again so i roll for that it's a 22 15 damage i'm going to wait for everybody to go inside i motion to grog and i'm like you know what to do damn it what's going on in there i hear lots of ruckus don't give me that scanlan oh scanlan you can hear me what's going on in there i turn to grog they're all dying 17 i look through the door what's going on in here are there any enemies i can see oh okay is he-- (laughs) (laughs) how tall is the thing no like we're in a bunker right and the ceiling is-- oh i will waltz in behind grog i cast light and now do i see that guy better ah right there's another one of those guys over there yes i spend three sorcerer points no i have not because i didn't do anything last game because i was all recharged i have eight right now now i'll spend it to go down to-- five 'cause math i could have used it i cast my pillars or grand columns as i like to call it and (piston sound) all the way up and smash that little bastard he does a dex save and he takes 6d6 damage and the dex save is to see if he's pinned or not oh my what no which is 15 18 points of damage oh so that-- does that mean he's in the air for a whole round 'cause how it works is he's all the way up to that height but he gets to come or fall back down if he makes the save that's how-- so he has to travel that distance so does he cast levitate as he's coming down eight two of my d6s to heal up parkour past percy i'm gonna follow suit but slowly i make it up to where those guys are as i hear the noise i-- oh shit before i leave i carefully examine that statue the facial features of the god the deity right is that what he is i'm gonna do a quick arcana check just to see if there's any kind of mystical thing around it or anything like that and it's 19 interesting knowing that i kind of gather my thoughts and i head towards where the rest of the group is nice i make it to the doorway and go what is going on in here no what is it i check it for 18 for whatever you're trying to hand to me absolutely scanlan i'll take that for now and i put it in my pouch i have text and whatnot [break] you mean these shirts thanks whitey that's his nickname it's not like a-- i know but i said what's up whitey like to him personally and then they look at me like oh my lord that's so racist (laughter) i mean i can wait what hold on tiberius is gonna work some magic and then try to conjure up a few more he was unaware there was a shortage of of those-- okay are we sure there's no other way out of here through this particular floor is that the only exit absolutely not (laughter) that's a terrible idea stop talking stop talking hold on (laughter) no no no you're brilliant your highness i have an idea i have an idea eventually actually yes this is what's going to happen as far as we know they're all duergar up there correct this is what will happen those who can go stealth we will creep up there i will go invisible myself i will be in front you closely behind me vax there we go you closely behind me and whoever else can stealth follows suit i will cast alter self and turn myself into their god i absolutely know what he looks like we just saw his statue but that's who they worship as i give my whatever the hell i come up with to say at that particular time-- as soon as the mind flayers catch on and i turn to clarota and i turn to kima that's when all of you will strike at them first the rest of you will wait 'til i shoot off a couple of fireballs at the duergar once they figure out we're full of crap 'cause i'm sure that might happen unless i'm super convincing which i hope that's the case-- but i think that's our best bet to keep a certain element of surprise yes vax no let's go up that one yes of course okay oh is that what we need to do what what oh i have an idea okay i'll peek around sweet 27 i cast watery sphere at the end of the last guy and create a giant ball what does it look like vax on the last guy yeah and i draw it towards us and i stop at the last guy my spell dc 17 yeah yeah yeah because i'm like holding them up i do mm-hm and i cast alter self and i turn to-- it's a religion check how tall are the-- so let's make him six feet tall no stay in the corner grog wait 'til i say help me and then come kill everything is this going to be the entrance where we're going in that's your job bust the door open as that happens i cast light and i cast prestidigitation i can't hear what's going on i hear some annoyances in the background as i cast prestidigitation to make my voice louder oh shit (shouts) silence all of you silence who knows who i am 16 well it looks like there's one saved soul at this point in time silence as i cast-- as i say silence i blow a big plume of fire out of my mouth and i cast control flames i don't cast control flames i just do the fireball for effect i don't do control flames because that's a concentration spell just (fwoosh) 18 18 that's right boy i am laduguer you know and you know your deeds as of late might upset my rest (shouts) all of you lay down your arms and i don't care for you to finish that sentence i cast fireball right fucking-- right on him of course it is uh 25 oh i'm sorry 30 quickly quickly yes hold on i still have a bonus attack i can
