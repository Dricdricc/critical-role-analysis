yes greetings and salutations everyone last week when kit was here-- hi kit we miss you we went to it's a wrap over in burbank california me and liam and laura and marisha and kit and her hubby we were there and saw this robe and i think marisha and laura were like try it on and i was like okay and i tried it on and was like oh my god it was made for me yeah totally i was like oh my god and liam tweeted a picture about it and then i was streaming on my stream on twitch and somebody mentioned the robe and michael bauman-- thank you again i'm going to thank you on critical role for-- he donated $400 which was the cost of the robe and then he just wrote in the chat this is for the robe so i'm wearing the robe thank you very much thank you so much you guys and all you guys who pitched in and stuff thank you good morning everyone oh i see are you saying they're having relations well i was thinking last night grog that we're probably going to be here for a little bit before going anywhere do we go anywhere who oh right yes also i really want to see allura for no particular-- actually for very specific reasons yes one of them is i want to pick up one of the earrings of telecommunication it has been finished for quite some time we just have to go to where she resides to pick it up then one of us could have another one i feel so good i'm telling you it's helping too (poof) a little dust and fix that for him matthew rolling-- 12 i'm just trying to teach my pet something but i rolled a 12 oh i want it to follow to follow he's in a mood also why is everybody in a mood today i'm going to go down to my laboratory i'm not there well i was doing my research on that stuff last night and this morning it's just my ability because of my class i do the backstory i am a noble sage yeah i know and i spliced them because it made sense no the noble part is the rp the sage is the perk and i was writing down the sigil to the keep that's completed wonderful i did it right this time knowing that i take some files and-- i want to check if i can-- nope i can't do anything yet that's it i'm going to go upstairs yes absolutely that's what my items are for i've only found one of them there are still three or four if they even exist out there there are countless things to go and venture forth and explore the artifacts the ring of boros the old hag that is the next step in my quest she told us it would be in the feywood right that is where we need to go but that's why we ran into her in vasselheim and she wouldn't tell me anything more well you've seen how i've used my mending wheel countless ways moreover it would prove to the council that all of the things that i went on this journey for to begin with it was true or for naught and really to gain the respect of my father and everyone else you don't know how hard it is to be a chromatic dragon in a metallic world it's not easy of course which is why i have pledged my loyalty to you all and i need your strength as well there is no way i could accomplish in my mission alone i mean grog when i ran into you in that one bar how many men were you beating up i counted eight if i recall here was this brute who i would have ran away from but here you were and i found you to be rather charming i figured well that's some good company to keep rather and then i met the rest of you and look where we are now she felt nothing but of course and i was giving my new krull blade a good old try she was-- okay fine are there woods nearby well yes one raises a hand to me or vox machina they are going to die it is simple i do not know why this is a discussion i won't be as cruel-- yes to someone who was opposing us that was a child who was innocent or was he opposing us too i don't remember actually i'll show you how you just have to do it really slow allura saw everything as well one of them was still alive i didn't kill both of them yes 19 the briarwoods are vampires and that old lady who was a butthole by the way was with this demonoid person who we had to fight as well so the point is we all know how dangerous it is that the knowledge of vampire existence and the spreading of those vile creatures and now we know they do exist so however the means that that came about is neither here nor there we know where they are actually you take a stormwind's word for-- i stand up no need for threats friend are we done here he gave her a magic winky face wait a minute i really need to go to allura she's our best interest right now it is beyond that there are several reasons to go we need to get the earring of telescription i need her to enchant something for me too as well as the fact i fear that our keep may be in danger i would like to ask her if she may be able to set up a warding spell for-- oh i absolutely did her and another one with this-- what was he a tiefling named the broker attacked us and that's why i killed her i need to see that sigil thank you so much lady allura i shall the only way we can go there is telling them when i talk to asum and get that sigil to that damn briarwood keep that's how we get there we don't have to lie to them we tell them where we're going and we can just go there it's just a piece of it i'd like to stop by the temple real quick to pick up my decanter i'm doing all the shit i'm going to stop at an armory because i want my crossbow reinforced i don't know what that means i want to learn a different sigil the one that i researched for the waste fair or for the way-- the feywild there's this big city next to it that i researched that is near it and in that city might be a sigil so i'm going to go see if i can learn it and then i want to come back and start enchanting my blades i can give it to you i wrote it down and then i have to go to the dry cleaners for my robe who doesn't have a ring an earring stop by and pick up the decanter from the temple then the only thing i do is visit the keep with the sigils library or whatever the sigil that's closest to the feywild then i only pick up my decanter i don't do that damn i forgot my short-term memory is just jacked what city was that near then i'll go to the thing and i'll find the westruun sigil no i didn't i used the amulet and we got permission to come there i saved that favor for this have i reached the keep yet is allura on the way back from the lyceum i'm going to allura's at allura's tower is that it so i just turn around go back greeting and salutations i'm tiberius stormwind from draconia moreover a member of vox machina over at greyskull keep it seems that you all are posturing and whatnot (chuckles) it's adorable but i'm here to see lady allura could you let her know that i would like to speak to her or get out of my way so i can just go over there and tell her myself well do the second thing if you don't do one thing do one of the other things oh it has been it has been processed oh that's good to know i appreciate that very well i

you but where are you going you go play up there tell your brother to be good anyway you're so pretty you can do anything with magic you can make things go you can make things stop grog is big scanlan's small everything is great hi i also go up to the door and go trinket (mumbling) percy no it's been like five minutes hasn't it yes yes keyleth we are vox machina over from greyskull keep i'm tiberius stormwind have you seen any of its droppings anywhere i'm fine i go invisible oh we are not actually cows if it's polymorph i couldn't cast stuff i redact my invisibility and i'll be a cow i'm also going to be a cow i want to be a brown cow that's good i try to speak to the cow hello i'm tiberius stormwind from draconia you're dr doolittle make sure the cow-- what she may know a cow that is over there just ask about the bird ask her where the moon is at night-- it's a cow this is the same as before oh we are ourselves still can i prestidigitate smells sweet go ahead (laughter) is it jumanji time i cast stoneskin on myself i'm going to fix my ring on it as it gets close i'm going to brace my ring as it's coming towards us cast slow on it 17 it's concentration no wait it is a concentration 17 five shush what the hell good i drop stoneskin at 5th-level i go myself one two three-- i cast fly on all of us fly you fools and go right after them (shouting) fly vox machina moo 60 feet i'm going to dash on that no he's a little pebble i go full gandalf you're both flying cows i think it lasts for like eight hours how far away from it are we it's only 500 feet away from me right now okay cool well i'm going for it still where am i it's taking off right now and i'm over here okay if it's doing that then i'll fucking go higher and try to meet it where it's going are we flying anymore oh shit okay oh no that's a good idea i like that idea yes i'm going to cast greater invisibility on myself and then follow oh wait no i don't do that damn it i forget we're still flying i thought we'd landed already no 16 16 i rolled an arcana check of 17 of my surroundings-- where it's coming from or i mean moo then as he's saying that i'll approach and as i approach the thing i'm going to dispel magic on myself what is that 11 i'm going to say is this big bird thing asleep i'm not trying to harm it at all i'm just seeing if it's fine if we could talk i can't see anything and i wanted to cast light so i could see something but i don't want to hurt your bird's eyes so it's awake cows we were cows we didn't do anything to the creature no we were-- this creature was stealing the farmer's cows and the farmers were saying you've taken our livestock which is hurting the farm we came to help them and we posed as cows and then your bird took our-- light but i'm going to block it with my hand so it's not going to blind the bird sorry i tried to not blind you it was very dark i'm sorry hello we mean you no harm i am talking to him the life and purpose of their existence is to keep those other people alive when one has an establishment when one grows its own crop and one steals something it is considered a crime fair point would you not like to be called byron or would you like something else like b-roy or b-man my name's tiberius stormwind from draconia and this is my friend keyleth who is also a druid and we also have a friend who is a gnome who sings songs and whatnot i'm feeding a tiny snack to lockheed as he swoops i've never seen anything quite like it i'm going to aid her too no she really knows her stuff i mean we just fought this fire guy-- or just the other way oh i might have an idea yes see your creature is rather large and powerful yes you have a rather strong bond with him which is quite unique with such a unique looking creature whitestone yeah well i guess there's a couple of options really there's this town whitestone that's pretty great and has a lot of livestock that this creature can consume that is a 24 well the other option was like i was saying perhaps you can form an agreement with emon i'm sure it would pay in livestock rather well for the protection of you such a powerful druid over at least a section of the land in exchange for free food for your friend that's right that's true that's a wonderful idea vex yes i'll aid her as well it is true though i mean it's just feed walking all around for it us yes no us who are members of the guild no not here other places that we're forced to do it but still we're members i'll take out my scroll of telescription and start writing a note i flip over the note that i'm writing to him and then i trigger it (flying noise) as he's reading it as that's going on because we're going to head back right now to seal this up right then i'll do my teleportation circle which is closer to the northeast the lyceum or the keep i put one in my bag of holding too all right i'll burn another 5th-level and then fly us all out
