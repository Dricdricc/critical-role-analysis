going to be doing some songs with them and performing with them as well check it out for gather your party tomorrow what time is that sorry zac 700pm i played that on genesis i'll take it that's 20 for me 20 22 a what oh nasty things these otyughs yes they're not even there yet whatever you do don't go up next to it right now i can move first right i'll move around next to kashaw no i'm not can i take a step back really i thought i could move five feet okay i won't do anything here's what i'm going to do instead i'm sorry i don't know what was wrong i've been off and i apologize for how i've been sounding what i'm going to do is i'm going to lift my finger and i'm going to aim behind that three-headed bastard and i'm going to release a 4th-level fireball yes behind him where it won't hurt keyleth and will just hurt him wherever that is i'm going to immediately spend two sorcery points and quicken spell and i'm going to turn around and do three scorching rays to follow up the fireball right at that dude each head i'm going to on that spell spend another-- okay 17 wonderful so let's see here's a six here's a five okay so i'm going to now-- hold on i'm going to spend one sorcery point to empower the spell and i'm going to pick the six and reroll these four dice because i can reroll up to that many when i empower for that damage perfect what's the total for that guys what is that nine that's 24 and then (counting) 48 so i'm going to do that okay and then the scorching ray happens and i'm going to heighten that spell which gives you disadvantage against the save is that what i want to do yeah that's what i'm going to do oh actually i don't do that then i don't spend those points i was supposed to do true strike to make that work d20s right wonderful yeah they all hit i got a 14 an 18 a 19 and my spell attack bonus is plus 11 ooh that's gross and i'm going to empower that spell as well so it's four and i'm going to pick four out of these six-- no i rolled a six (counts quietly) 29 yes it does did you roll at disadvantage cloak of displacement ac is 18 22 yeah that hits this is fun how much damage is that total really plus the other damage that's 16 so 26 27 so what's half of that because of the stoneskin my stoneskin is still up hour i cast that when we were chasing him-- okay 13 points man they can't touch me i'm up in the air yo aw man i thought he was whipping me around he's got me like this right yeah sure i'm going to cast true strike on him cantrip on him i'm going to look for a weakness that'll give me advantage on my next-- then i'm going to quicken spell and spend two more sorcery points to cast-- well i'm going to look over can i see where vax and him are coming i can see behind the creature though because that's within range so i will do misty step behind him and get out of that grip yes as far away behind him as i can go and that is my turn nope yes i think he likes me there's a bunch of rats down here stormwind what the hell are we in is there a roof what do i use 15 no 14 okay well i've got one right next to me right i'm going to put out my hand and i'm going to do a firebolt right next to that one why are they on me oh right well then i'm going to not do that i'm going to cast obelisk of stone and then quicken spell and then i'm going to do a firebolt that's what i'm going to do yeah about ten feet and then i'll do the 2d10 damage d10s here's one is it a d10 do what now roll to hit first yes thank you is that a spell attack roll that's 31 cool so that's 11 so that's 16 what is that 12 oh i'll do that i prestidigitate all the crap off i think we've learned all we can from this one i rolled a 23 arcana check on thorbir's jeweled knife that he gave me i agree what was the ruling on the arcana check the jeweled knife that thorbir gave me kashaw how close are you to your god i don't oh how is that being married to a god that's rather inconvenient ooh so it's not like you can ask for a favor i suppose yeah and as this is going on i dissipate the light spell 20 are there torches down this hallway are there torches in this hallway yes 21 i'll point to the one coming from opposite of vax that guy and then i'm going to do true strike on him and i'll back away that's good that's my turn yeah you should definitely-- over here kashaw 20 i take no pleasure in this i cast obelisk of stone and crush them both of them i'll move forward and then do it or as close as i can as far away as i can see vax no they take the damage they're not pinned they just take the damage 31 points of damage i'm going to spend two sorcery points to quicken a spell and then cast scorching ray right at it (fire blasts) what is that oh plus my spell attack okay so 16 was one 19 and 19 two four six okay that's ten and 15 and then 18 23 that's negative that's 16 i failed wait he has to roll at disadvantage cloak what's half of that it's an hour-long spell i can still hold another one and do a different one and hold the other spell that's 16 17 points both daggers are magical okay cool that's actually great to know i'm actually happy about that keyleth is right next to me right vax is right next to me also can i move probably take a hit from him and drag her with me that's what i choose to do yeah i'm going to pop one of my simple potions yeah okay that's seven can i use the rest of my turn to help her up all right and that's my turn vex no stop what are you doing that's what i said i do not follow i will go no further until i take a proper rest i agree we've been hit pretty hard pretty quickly you have those what does that do are there bananas what are dollars sure thank you keyleth we're still on day one well i'll tell you this everyone i have only a limited amount of spells left to be effective in a fight against a creature like this i have no melee offenses towards this creature whatsoever so that's going to be up to you with magical weapons and whatnot i'm assuming i'm virtually tapped out of all my spells so is the cleric as well so if we move forward that's fine we're only six hours in on the first day of this contract i will follow the group i'm fine we have days left (laughs) i like johnny kraghammer yes i agree i heard he was brave very brave it is legend as he's doing this i cast fly on thorbir keyleth the cleric and vax and myself i can cast it at 6th level i'm terrible at math not vax us four oh yes yeah that disney princess shit you saw was lewberger and they're playing tomorrow at gather your party on this channel and i will be performing songs with alex lewis who's half of lewberger and i get to call zac a dumdum for once zac the dumdum played the one video that i'm not in was through alex so he's the dumdum now sorry about that for the confusion that's what's going on you'll see me dance like a monkey tomorrow oh yeah we can all get on this one oh natural 20 i am helming the damn magic carpet of course natural 20 are they infernal i got ten so i figured i cast fly on all of us 16 17 don't worry about him is he a gnome get the carpet from him instead i'll take out my mending wheel when i land and grab the carpet what i'm fixing it i'm using the mending wheel i prestidigitate it off first there 18 it was a waste of fucking time let's press on i'm cranky because i haven't slept that's why yeah too bad right nor does tiberius this is a death march no we can make it fly again i cast greater invisibility our hand is forced we are bound by contract i do not personally wish to be here what is this offer that you speak of if that is your real name i don't think it's a bad idea that same guy five well done 12 rakshasa hold on what is he doing is he casting a spell 4th-level counterspell no it shall not do nothing on my watch how can he see me by the way i'm invisible still bastard is that a spell do i recognize that as a spell being cast counterspell damn it 19 none of our magical works against-- you know what i'm going to say i'm speaking draconic again sorry (laughter) okay fine i'm going to attempt to cast slow on both of them 40-foot cube 120-foot range center it where it won't hurt anybody else except for them actually i think i can pick who i affect and that's what i do slow down i think that will affect the rakshasa 17 21 cool so now it takes a negative two penalty to its ac and its dexterity saving throws and it can't use reactions sweet and i move as far away from everything as i can that's what i do what happened is a spell being cast oh counterspell 4th level shut up i'm trying to save you take a potion did you say clow move me in sight range of both of them as a good sorcerer would be positioned i'll cast silence right in the center of the room yep not hitting kashaw and i sit in indian-style position now cast stuff butthole i dissipate my greater invisibility spell so it can see me i can do that too good job lara i mean vax what's above us okay any light coming down i'm going to cast obelisk of stone rakshasa the butthole and smash the shit out of both of them 20 feet high maximum height it's a dex save so he's pinned to the ceiling and they both take 21 damage will and right that means they don't get pinned by it all right and he's pinned i look at him and i'm like-- oh because of the silence i'll dissipate the spell so i can hear him were you trying to say something thorbir 4th-level counterspell yeah and i have two stored in there no i can carry five up to 4th-level spells it's my ring of spell storing it can carry up to five spells that go up to 4th level i don't understand that that's not how it worked before yeah still 4th-level counterspell as a matter of fact no 6th-level counterspell (growling) you will go nowhere that's far as i can go do i have advantage or anything okay 19 19 (shouting) no one threatens a goddamn stormwind i think i just broke my hand (laughter) is it behind us yes of course that's exactly what i was going to do i'm taking some of the blood for sure filling some vials i'm going to take my dagger out and i'm going to shave trimmings from his fur and his whiskers i'll take those very good we have to break through those first fireball fireball fireball breaky breaky breaky i had a bottle of air i turn around and go like you really don't want to do that friend trust me please oh what is that 14 (garbled) draconian again (laughter) one more insult madam and you will find your whole establishment on fire i'm not in the mood oh well in that case i take it as a compliment i need a bed and i motion towards the thing i'm sleepy it has been a pleasure and an honor kashaw you as well thorbir you are brave warriors and would do well in the draconian knights he said my name right it's mind-boggling and our warlock (cheering)
