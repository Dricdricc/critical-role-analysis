oh shit it's this but gray thank you so much who's the name of the guy our magic carpet matt aberny i believe yes aberny if we're saying your name wrong i will say it right next week i'm sorry but you're awesome abernathy you know who you are thank you they're awesome yeah and it rocks kit we love you she's so good grog it's of my ancestor different energies man what do you mean what do you want me to do guys i'm just gonna sing a song right now hey you're wearing a cool shirt you what it takes a while for me to do that it takes like at least a few hours to make sleep arrows right action math nice you yell it across boom how many do you need i got much what am i doing right now oh good 18 that close ash that close to just spitting out all my coffee i'll follow suit and be like oh is this what we're doing scanlan what are we doing oh uh very well i'll watery sphere and help him maintain him yeah like it's a dope-ass effect yep wizards of the coast page 304 what are you talking about how big is it i can capture those but not that guy so hold on i knew that i do that to wash him off and i'm swirling around i'm like does this feel good giant currently washing his hump three over here you can do non-lethal damage to him we are she can knock him out though you mean for a snack though you're saying we need more of his brutish tank-ish strength could you perhaps put him to sleep for the evening we'll secure him but clarota could you prolong the sleep spell for eight hours so we can rest and you could do your spell i hand him some jerky it's really delicious engorgio right it is poisonous it's fine if he did something we'd kill him it's a minute to cast let me sleep hold on i'm going to encourage success yeah stop posing for just a second take the chains off i believe we should take the chains off i saunter up hello i'm really impressed are you our friend now oh well wonderful tell him to follow our orders that's all he needs to know for now oh good vex you got that could you translate that 30 days i walk up to the giant and i take out my jerky do we all have to say it that way vex'ahlia he likes the jerky we should ask his name and be polite i'm going to inspect it arcana check 23 oh this is of course the javelin of lightning this javelin is a magic weapon when you hurl it and speak its command word it transforms into a bolt of lightning yeah (laughter) i'll do a history check nature check what kind of check the giant guy it depends on what we say i am not setting foot in that temple quite yet he's fine for 30 days no we are not taliesin and i am telling you right now i am not setting foot in that thing's lair until we figure out a damn way to get it out of that lair absolutely percy i'm saying this right now i'm not stepping foot in that lair i think we can actually my idea is this-- with the new addition of our giant friend we do have a great advantage we can definitely make the distraction as you say i propose keyleth and another stealth member somehow see a way if there is some kind of ventilation that leads into the major butthole's chamber yes absolutely and when finding this craft some type of piping system where we could smoke him out if he has to breathe which i believe aberrations need to breathe and eat if we smoke him out and he cannot breathe he must leave the facility and if we go in there we would be at an extreme disadvantage in many ways than we realize i just proposed the idea i don't know but that's what we all need to figure out that's what i'm talking about oh so there are prisoners right oh so i'm sorry i was misled earlier so this is the good part of the plan we do exactly what you're saying first clarota here will rally the illithid to fight for us that's when we smoke out the beholder we do it a different way we don't go near him the room that he's in is sealed up oh my god that is incredible i am not going anywhere near that temple i mean i suppose that could work possibly just has to be line of sight right mm-hm right yeah actually that could work i could do it from afar maybe on the carpet yes i bring out the yellow vial this is the thing that's going to hurt the most do you have a rusty trombone (groaning and laughter) it will simply just heat it of course i can not saying it is clarota ooh that's right doesn't quite work that way it works on creatures i'm not sure i could do this clarota how much does the crystal weigh keyleth what did the structure look like again many structures like this-- we won't have to maybe do any of that if we could just merely bend the structure i believe that would compromise the magical integrity usually structures like this are designed for a particular arcane reason if we were to merely damage it grog you could just as you do to most things i mean i could probably help as well along with clarota but that's an option it would only carry you right hold on vax are you planning on going alone that's silly that's even more silly he sent me this well i'm keeping it yeah that's fine all right how many are we away from that let's go [dramatic music] look grog and i cast prestidigitation and i make fart noises (fart noises) oh look i'm farting (makes fart noises) i figured he'd like that i pick up a piece of the cask i take my wheel out (whizzing noises) i was trying to tell you that before you hit the creature but it worked out pike what is a movie oh like light like that we do not want that no i like the first half of that idea vax no that idea will work as well too i think what we should do is do the mouse thing whoever-- i guess we make the effort to go in however we can manage to get into the top of wherever we are going to attack those beams as it were to do damage to the thing controlling whatever that's when we should lightly drop him in as a mouse because when this takes enough damage which he should as a mouse the spell will wear off and he would poof back into whatever we should do it right on the beholder because that i think would be more a distraction for the creature a beast against a nasty beast is always a good fight we need all the people in the town alive clarota will be upset if we hurt anybody and we need their aid i suggest because i have a feeling that because this is his lair he will have and i'm talking about k'varn he will have advantages that we do not understand if we go in and we will have disadvantages exactly i'm saying that is why so if we threw our rather large friend here in and do the thing that will get us control and clarota can help us manage everyone in the town even the slaves will rally that's what i'm saying after we've destroyed the mechanism right that's why we cannot attack the town bats will be a problem bats catch fire rather quickly if i recall no that's when we get out and smoke him out if you're talking about fighting k'varn in his lair when he attacks you-- absolutely not vax possibly yes that would be the best-case scenario and where's beholder-face actually if everything starts going amiss i will make the call follow me and i will get out of here as soon as possible if i'm dead then i'm afraid none of you will survive what we have to be on the carpet is that a carpet joke i can make a portal that we can all step in and bamf to-- we have to be where i cast it yes yeah yes oh percy yes i believe it's this i'll do the signal so yes so that's a no there he is no i cast fly on him and i hop on his back this time you can see this should be a lot smoother oh no he didn't two trips wait what why yes of course but outside here with me and lady kima you must survive because you must tell allura of my deeds for no particular reason no you'll keep fly up because i can just hop on the carpet i'm casting it twice but trinket can get on the carpet he needs a diet wait a minute hold on hold on a tick how much can you lift grog so a shit-ton no no no i mean one at a time i cast fly on trinket oh wait and i'll do that i'll wait because i can only do it one at a time so i'll burn it for him let's go i'll burn it for trinket the fly not right now no we'll go up first then i'll come back down with the carpet i'll cast fly on him and whoever is-- i'll stay down with trinket because i don't need to go up plus ten 23 yeah i'm staying on the carpet no i had to go with you so i could take the carpet back so i can come back with the carpet because they're dropped off shit that's 19 yeah thank you before i leave to go back down vex when you see it be sure to mark the beast yep trinket trinket think of vex go to vex go to vex she's up there it's very cool 23 it's your first time it's going to be a little rough how far away is it from me forget about it i thought you said roll oh i think you said i cast talk to bats hmm good i stay on the carpet are there any jutting stone things anywhere around it's just flat i should do it too as i do this i go to the bag of holding and i go to the endless rope-- oh yeah i know and the endless rope as i'm asking for that i take out my immovable rod and i'm going to place it kind of in an exit position and (clicks) make it stay right above there and i start flipping through the rope so it goes-- the whole time i'm just doing that so it goes all the way down 25 i agree i think that's poppycock we'll be fine yes come up just shoot him wherever we need him to drop and (pfft) oh 'cause he's fat yes i'll take the mouse throw me the mouse dm which side has the crew worked on relative to where i am looking at did they damage this side or this side use the boots not me i am chilling so then they've been working on this side right this way wonderful right before things happen i'll cast blur i going to aim and-- i swoop down and pick everybody up i know i'm going to start to-- 19 everyone use the rope it's time to leave yes yes wait that's all i can do no clarota shoot the damn eye she's not on the carpet i'm going to say it's-- the strength is 50 yeah but i can like dash and double my movement speed as well which i should've done last turn 'cause i don't want to go there oh shit okay well can i still dash with that and double that speed of the carpet okay well i don't wanna get anywhere near that i actually want to hover around to the city side and i want to look and see what's going on with the crowd downstairs yes are you surprised i'm not i don't care i'm doing it through here what the hell do you think i'm doing i'm angry at all of you right now fastball special as far as down as i could have been to begin with so even-steven with those guys what do i see in the town do i see a mass anywhere natural 20 (cheering) great i jump off the carpet i cast fly on myself i go to where i can just right hover-- i want to hover above them about 20 feet away and as i come to it i'm going to flip out the carpet get on it cast alter self turn into clarota i'm going to keep my original lungs yeah i'm going to-- yeah i'll spend whatever i gotta spend i'm doing all of it can they see me the crowd that's coming that's what i-- i'm going to go towards the crowd i wanna-- no i dispelled the carpet so i can do double my speed so i can get there and then i redo the carpet as i-- no i grabbed it as i'm going with me i can't do that well that's not going to be as cool well then i'll just stay on the stupid carpet then if i'm like down at that level then i don't really have to do that i'll cast alter self though turn into clarota do i-- actually sans head piece clarota without the head piece and what do i see when i get down there how far away are they great you over there quickly and i get their attention look i took the form of one of your own pretty much to get your attention we need your help we want to defeat the one who's taken control over your mind we are the ones who disabled the crystal to begin with please come on this-- with me we can go much faster up here please damn right six plus ten that's 16 plus nine is-- my persuasion's nine plus 16 six plus nine that's 25 oh yes not if they're allies well i guess that was something noticing that then i will go to-- i don't have another movement right or was-- that's what i do why are you cheerleading somebody very good i'm not-- that's probably not going to work i head back up to the top actually no i don't i go to the side of the temple where the rope that i was throwing earlier goes and meets down to the floor so i-- yeah i will-- no i-- fuck no hold on a second i don't do that i redact that i have the fucking carpet okay i go back to the top i can get up there right like where they are does he see me that's what i mean like is he looking at me right now okay i'm going to cast telekinesis and rip his horn off his head well that doesn't happen oh actually-- i used that yeah no that doesn't hit so i'll have to spend another-- okay then i'll spend five more and i'll attempt to rip off one of his tentacles i'm going to check that last one off check this off i'm blast-- i'm using all these from my ioun stones i yeah that hits what is that my 20-- oh no-- fuck what i said it's 29 yeah oh it does damage four and i hop off the carpet and i leave it there or i hand it to-- who's next to me uh you and that was a terrible movie how many stalks does it have left left okay where is it actually from where-- oh okay i'll do a-- i'll shoot a glacial blast at him just a concentrated-- i'll spike it right before it hits him and jam it in his fucking eye yes 6d8 oh shit i need d8 for this do you have d8s i got it that is 40 what really two of ten times okay i'll just-- i mean like i said right before i do it i'll shape it into an ice spike and right through the eye wonderful while i-- no i spend five sorcerer points and i do telekinesis and rip the horn off his fucking-- that's it after that it's my turn what is that oh that's 26 i'll hold it in place for now and kind of-- yeah yeah i just killed it don't tell me what to do dawg wait 'til we're not fighting i hold it here i don't want to-- oh as i see that i'm going to float this more towards me and i take it-- now it's hovering above i'm going to hold it about 25 feet away from me in the air irresponsible-- you have no idea you have no idea what you guys are in for after this i'm not going to-- that's not-- that's the next episode sweet yeah that was my first oh elven thank you thank you
