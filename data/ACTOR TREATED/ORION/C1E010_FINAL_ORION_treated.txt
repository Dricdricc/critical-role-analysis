yeah have we talked about something important here guys there are these shirts that we need to sell listen guys this is something that we need to really discuss first i love you travis i think you guys out there need to really look in your hearts-- and moreover your wallets-- and get one of our shirts just get them because they're dope i don't think we did sorry (all laugh) 16 she can move it just fine just think forward well 16 but that's fine how far away am i right now well i'll move the carpet the minimum distance i have to for her to get in range okay so that's where i'll stay this doesn't look good i cast obelisk of stone on my dear friend (fshh) i'm going to raise him up out of harm's way no i only raise it about 20 feet and then i go that was a good idea and then i spend three sorcerer points and i hock a fireball (fwoosh) at all those fuckers too yes two four six is it six or eight 32 damage oh shit (all laugh) hold on as he falls-- do i still have a movement after this it certainly does vex would you finish that bastard off i'm sorry yes sorry grog i'm sorry percy listen i'm sorry everybody i didn't mean to kill everybody so quickly i'll let you kill everybody next time percy that's not how you really-- as he's doing that i get 18 trying to see what's up what you have there is a greatsword of frenzy grog you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon ooh when you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll after dealing damage you can immediately make an additional attack for free vex let me see the diamond for just one second as he's shaking his sword i go into the bag of holding and take out the mending wheel that's not how it works vex there you go oh this thing i'll do an arcana check on the vial which is not great i don't know it looks icky does this cave bottleneck pull them down you guys want to run 18 get on the damn carpet you fools yeah that hits yes you're ruining my robe (grunts) well (grunts) fire breath (roaring) get off of me so wisdom how many d6 oh hang on is it no i don't want to roll wrong i think it's 2d6 oh awesome cool (panting in relief) 21 if i do something i'll probably have disadvantage right correct well i'll just try it again i'll spend fuck jeez no no i fly around and (ping) hit one of my stones and i'll spend five sorcerer points to cast telekinesis and (blast sound) fling it off me oh yeah arcana 20 (grunts) good i use my movement to get the hell out of there (grunts) i am going no a bunch of people are on the carpet i'm still on the carpet that'd be so fun oh crap wisdom aw i rolled a four is it casting a spell oh my lord what's the creature made out of what's his skin like when i look at him well i don't really-- hey what do you think i should do guys (all laugh) haste doesn't work that way now i'll defer for now bigby hand nice i see what happens yes i'll follow suit i'm going to i'm going to straight-up cast this because i have to i cast telekinesis and i pull the eye out (sucking noise) okay and do i have advantage because of the grapple and that's my what 17 i'm going to float it over and put it in one of my vials i'm going to smell it first of all i rolled a 16 for a history check on the creature so that's 14 oh no arcana yeah 25 well yes i want the teeth also how close are we how long will that take i rolled a natural 20 to help him with any arcana enchantment if he succceeds a lot can happen in ten minutes it's just a thing there's going to be things here could be a tide cave prestidigitation now you're all dry yes oh light i want to do an arcana check 18 check for any nasty magic well sure but it means that thing will be bright the whole time yes you would (fire breath noise) let's do that i agree i'm tired pike can you sense if there's any nasties down there right i suggest we go and rest i believe we can get some respite as soon as i see her royalty go in-- as soon as i see keyleth go off i rub my ring and go invisible i'm not pike is chuckling at best actually i think that's a good idea percy the bomb that scanlan is holding could you fix a thing around it to possibly hold magic properties you can use some of this-- one of the glass my potion-- what do you call those fucking things yes i cast silence on vax (all laugh) counterspell do you have counterspell you don't have counterspell counterspell just fizzles his shit and i don't silence him did i have to roll anything to do that oh cool 17 i just know it's 120-foot range should write the other stuff down no it wasn't but yes i do have fireballs left and i dispel it immediately i'm unpredictable with what vex is getting to percy is if you could fashion such a thing or if i could i'll enchant it can i attempt to imbue the bomb with a fireball in it okay you have a bomb hold it out in your hand please i cast telekinesis i pick up the bomb and i start guiding it into the cave pay attention ranger i'm still invisible oh dope yes what's with that so all right well i rolled 21 yes i rolled a 13 the second time as soon as i let go i cast invisibility on myself again i'm going to wait what happens as soon as i hear that noise fireball 32 yeah i feel we should camp here for the night or day whenever the heck yes of course that's obvious yes exactly that's what i was going to say earlier me clarota mm that's what i do with clarota that means he likes me ooh clarota yes do you think we could after a rest of course conjure a way and possibly break the barrier and go to that side oh that would be awful i need it well at least we know this beach is secure we should go out in the front and seal this up for the night this is inside and i was outside they were hearing stuff inside wait how wide is the slimmest part of the cave i see if you'll excuse me i reach into my pouch and pull up the scroll of telescription i enchant it to reach my brother jerahd i write on it dear brother it seems i am in a bit of a pickle with a certain type of creature that can take control of others with its mind and do nasty things goes by the name of k'varn and the only thing i know about him is that he has a black horn please help love tiberius he can't smell it scanlan and i send it hopefully he answers back promptly jerahd is a warlock and is a wizard of the mind arcana things i do not know of he could possibly help us and has access to great knowledge in this matter is that b-52s yeah that's cool i'm going to really enjoy it just do that yes he should've got the message immediately i'm pretty sure he's researching it before he answers you are astute i say all that stuff out loud i do not think that is wise your highness hold on a second wait a minute i think we're doing this a bit prematurely if she fails he will know where we are it was because he had eyes to look through so she tells us right it is really not a thing we want to fight it is awful it is wretched it will kill all of us if we don't find out a way to kill it-- oh my god dm i write a detailed-- i believe we should go and rescue the prisoners and build a small army moreover i've been thinking it all goes downward correct he's all up in a pit yes no the beholder k'varn up or down liam and well that won't help me at all no both of you have got earrings no like 20 or something like that we have twinkies oh yay that man loves you thank you it does get warm in here just a little bit that's right nice holy what oh cool oh dude yeah those are hilarious hey cerulean kestrel it does he was just courting us at first thank you yes it does absolutely really have fun hey everybody huh liam matt and yeah i know these guys were talking about stuff i know about and i was responding to other people that were talking on twitter chaotic good can you just be good scootch hit them up tell them you want us there when i want to (laughs) tiberius isn't old i don't care i'll just keep going wizards who do magic they have to pick it every day sorcerers invoke it they learn it from their being and they cast it out that way the character tiberius figuring him out that predicted which way i went because i feel he would just have it within him to do the whole thing is he's the keyser soze of the group in a way where he's the false buffoon but he knows exactly what he's doing when it comes to a battle and other particular things (english accent) we don't want no poo somebody wanted you to say something as trey yeah that's what these shirts are by the way these are from type-0 the thing that we're in pay attention yo that's adorable mine too bard out with your heart out do they ship you also adorable (laughs) tim burton yeah we don't know what happened we accidentally killed the ox right because we stuffed it in the bag every day he comes in two hours just writing songs total party kill we're going to be in the studio no holds bard that's the name of your album i don't know if you guys noticed who's been watching this whole time we've been playing i generally do random chaotic things to be quirky and funny just because i like to but this is the first time i was scared i really freaked out with the confirmation it's a fucking beholder it's terrible yeah and then i was terrified it was a deluge of terror after that he's kooky it was a year yeah there was a question for everybody you cannot pick yourself which is your favorite character i agree i would like to do the complete opposite of tiberius with rage and just tear shit apart with my teeth pike would be super fun to play too because clerics are crazy (laughs) it's done and they're garbage now no they're cursed oh you could buy cursed die which is now a mystical item that is true when it comes to dice i'd pay for cursed dice so we're good wait what happened yeah is that a group question i'm a slytherin oh shit somebody asked if tiberius is inspired by a particular wizard or something like that he actually is somebody mentioned elminster tony roberts that's exactly-- matt and that's going to be funny if i actually do that but no tiberius is actually based off elminster aumar who i play in neverwinter the mmo i booked that before we started the group and then when i decided to make him a sorcerer i was like-- it was right at the same time too-- we just started to play and that happened and yeah so he's a dragonborn elminster scanlan denied that's all you need we did start this campaign in a different thing we started in pathfinder and for a lot of us me included that was the first time playing d&d so matthew home-brewed everything in pathfinder and then right before we decided to do this we switched over to 5th edition i'm a big magic the gathering guy we play i will be on mulligan soon and i like red and white blue and black and all the colors of the rainbow envisioned it two years plus man and i'm drinking a lot less everybody give a quick huzzah to jareth he graduated high school today which isn't bad somebody asked why tiberius is so loyal to keyleth tiberius comes from a presidential family a family of political power of high-seating in his land so he's very honorable and keyleth is royalty in his eyes he didn't know because that was a reveal for keyleth's character i think it was a year and a half we were playing and then you revealed it somebody asked us a fun question if each of us could have a familiar like trinket if we could have our own animal what would it be tiberius of course would have a small dragonite or pseudodragon definitely oh and the dragon's name would be monty thanks effigy it's only 1130 nothing that exists really what's your favorite part ashley i'm going to say what my favorite part of d&d is much like doing improv it's a wonderful escape i know i'm really frantic in how i play it poor matthew he puts up with arguments about spells that i want to make super op and he's like you can't do that i'm like but why those are our arguments when we got together and we would play for 8 hours we would get together and have lunch or dinner and we would spend a lot of time and every game was a very special day so no matter if the day was going great or not it didn't matter because as soon as the game started it was a whole different world that we had to step into and now we live in it and we breathe it it's great we're all actors and to get lost in each other and with how matthew narrates and you'll see it when you watch the show i'm like oh and there's cameras now and that's a whole other layer and i still get lost in keyleth shedding a tear and the way clarota interacts differently i don't see matthew doing it i see (creature noise) that so it is that sense of realistic magic that exists every single game (laughs) there you go what was the other thing you said there were two questions i think i would want to be japanese because it would be a whole different cultural experience dragonborn for life (scottish accent) she's the special dwarf i tell people it's not about math it's not about paper and pencil when you were a kid and you went outside and played all day and you were just a kid that's what this is it's just remembering how to do that again with friends well hold on i don't love that hashtag i have a weird thing too i'm doing a thing where if you have a ps4 and you follow me on twitter @orionacaba every 20 followers i'm going to randomly pick one person i'll tweet at you and then tweet me your ps4 handle and i'll add you to my friends list and we can play together so yeah hit me up
