okay how about you laura that's liam o'brien everybody greetings and salutations everyone i'm orion acaba i'm a voice actor did you guys-- okay that's enough keyleth i'm a big magic the gathering guy also with travis and laura i hadn't played d&d before liam's birthday he was like hey we're doing this d&d thing i was like d&d okay i've known liam the longest maybe you the longest but he's like a brother to me so i'll do whatever i was like yeah i can play and stuff that led to a bond and a friendship and experience that i can't replicate or pay any money or do anything to even compare to anything else to this game has literally become the most important thing and most fun thing in my life every week through time and bullshitting around we'd find and tweeted stuff and randomly in our privacy of our own game and fucking now we're-- what the fuck is going on scanlan sends his regards as he's too busy fucking whores oh that's right sorry everyone matthew mercer is great now you talk (cheering) yeah i have to say one of my favorite aspects of what this is is we have-- and i said this to one of our fans i signed something for her-- is travis is one of my favorite things about the show tiberius is my favorite thing about the show but travis as a human being there's a lot of-- it breaks down those stupid walls where it's like no it's not a bunch of introverts in somebody's basement we have a big hulking mass of a man you know that can beat all of us up and he's there being as big of a geek as we are and it breaks down the thing where women can't play because you have these three gorgeous badass women kicking ass and also playing dungeons and dragons a lot of great things about this show that i love so that was a cinnamon roll fail for the record i'm really shitty at math so yeah it's super weird i've been youtubing comedy stuff for a bit they're mean and our people are not mean and they're really intelligent and compassionate it's fucki-- really great vax is stealthing into the crowd i wanted that thing since he got it and really-- no and i was going to approach it several ways and i talked to matthew a lot outside the game i never metagame but i get really excited i've been playing rpgs since i was ten and so half the time i think of strategy as opposed to the player i get really into that matthew's really good at think of who you're dealing with and then act accordingly with sam he's an interesting fellow to begin with i was going to pummel him to death really to get it back at first no she wouldn't like that so i didn't that's the simple silence telekinesis and then fireball him to death the thing is i'm a ucb guy (upright citizens brigade) he's also a funny guy there you go ucb he's funny i'm funny i'll use funny then it was empty chalkboard i was like math that'll be funny i'll fucking come up with something i figured more bees with honey or flies i have no idea how that saying goes you know what i was trying to say right use the honey instead i thought of that for a month of how to get that back for the math thing yes wait you did that for skyrim too didn't you yeah what's your name again they call him percy though tiberius i named for two reasons the first is tiberius caesar is caesar's father i wanted the character because it comes from a political height to your family to have that weight behind it and stormwind-- this is yes i fart a lot no i was actually-- at the time i was cracking the hell out of skyrim again it came out and you were passing and playing it again when we started the campaign and i think it's a place in skyrim or it's like the stormwind or something like that i was like yeah stormwind awesome yeah thank you two and a half years and some change years pass yeah i'm really creative i've totally-- it's really hard not to curse so i'm trying not to i was like wow yeah i came up with all that myself and then i started playing elder scrolls online again bad love that game i was dragonknight cool fans were hey just try dragonknight and then i started playing and i'm like draconic power draconia oh shit i ripped off skyrim the whole time i'm not creative at all thanks for pointing that out marisha i got your back translation he's a giant butthole that whole thing was another one of my favorite tiberius moments because he didn't deal with any of it tiberius jumped out the window while that shit was going down and feather fall to safety while these guys had to deal with that whole fucking thing they go through this whole ordeal and they come out of this tower that's crumbling barely with their lives and i'm like oh hello everyone and then sam throws shit on the dude's face we've got another question audience it adds a whole other layer of-- another question audience yes in all seriousness the k'varn fight is a really good example myself tiberius was terrified of fighting a beholder because i knew particularly as the only real caster of the group as soon as i get in the eyesight of that thing i'm useless the reason that i didn't go in there at all is because if i did i would be no use to anybody i don't know the range i'm not going to cheat you don't come back from disintegration you don't come back from death rays they're called death rays for a reason and then he throws it at us and i'm scared for a while more like a butthole one more question
