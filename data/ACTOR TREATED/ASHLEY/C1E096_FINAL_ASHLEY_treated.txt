we're gonna go find wilhand before i left did i see grog in his hat grog you look so distinguished you look so great in that hat where did you get this hat oh grog this is just the perfect job for you you know what it's just supposed to be a little jaunty like that i think yeah just a little-- it's great yes let's go see him yeah i mean in the backyard we have a pretty large tree well this is nice to see it's put together again well shall we (exhales) okay oh wilhand it's pike yeah yeah we-- i just went around (laughter) the gate was open and the dog run just went around the dog run oh oh oh i'm sorry i'm very strong for the most part for the most part (laughs) yes i'm okay and grog did a little bit as well well he-- we made it work you know he slept outside a lot he was smaller then he was smaller then he you know sometimes we would make forts well it's-- i'm an outdoorsy type people have different preferences and that's one we'll try it sometime i think you'll like it it's so good to see you sit and relax i know where everything is you don't have to-- i'll get tea ready for everybody just sit and relax sure i'm not sure bring it up very very lightly okay okay wilhand first of all i wanted to come see you 'cause it's been some time and i'm so glad that the house has come along so nicely that's fantastic oh i know what we were gonna ask you oh wait no we knew fassbender was gone never mind like not a very nice person rude well we came-- well first i wanted you to meet taryon our new friend well okay i'm just gonna-- you know i just feel like i like to be surrounded by all types to sort of you know get to know-- oh i thought you got-- you were (laughter) they came to visit 'cause i had sent them a little money and a letter and they came to town to stay and to just see the town and they told me something a little disturbing ogden said he's been having visions and dreams about something about a blood curse does this sound familiar to you at all this is true it's okay early 40s you can even fold up the sleeves to make them super fashionable so i don't mean to press you on this wilhand but did you know how he died i mean even if you weren't there did you hear about it i'm struggling a bit i feel like you've told me so much about the family and when they came to town i feel-- i almost feel bad about the way that i treated them and i feel like they're just if anything they're just odd i'm odd and you're odd and that's just the way trickfoots are well i thank you for that i couldn't imagine my life any different well he's my protector for sure well i mean i didn't do it we all did but we killed lots of dragons and you know we've done some pretty cool things i've traveled very far it just-- i think-- (laughs) i don't know i think over you know this past year-- (laughter) here here i have-- it's only half 'cause i ate half of it in our journey through the tree (laughter) but it's half of a blondie that was made yesterday well no i mean he was making them but it's our recipe i go and get some tea make the rest of the tea for everybody i got it i got it sit sit enjoy here here you know i know thank you for your honesty they're great when they're fresh i'll bring you a profiterolo 'cause that you will love i could maybe try and heal you of that well just one more thing so ogden in his visions that he's been having and he told this to vex that he saw visions of me dying basically by a shadowy-- i didn't ask him okay so would it be-- (laughs) would it be different if he had these dreams or visions if he was a follower of sarenrae or has found faith of some sort it's you know to each his own (laughter) i'm sure it's nothing but in case you remember anything okay i'll just take the rest of it i'll probably have it on the way home no no they're very good i promise we're working on it (laughter) i don't think so real quick i get up and i stand behind him and comb his hair out it looks so great just all natural out ready for the world but i wanted to make you just look a little bit more coiffed well can i just say i think you look perfect it hasn't washed out yet but it's fun for a little bit just to try something okay it was wonderful to see you okay what's that shoot finish the rest of the blondie through the fshoom i think so i'd like to talk to ogden again hello did you have a good time today well that's good it gets pretty loud here it's true i take it you went to firecracker alley yeah it's real loud will you take a walk with me well i just would love to spend some time with you alone uncle ogden i'll spend some time with you as well jb i just want to make sure i get time with everybody i'm blanking right now is there a temple of sarenrae here i would love to walk you to something that i was a part of building and creating here in the city if you'd like i walk him to the shrine of sarenrae do you know where we are this is a shrine of sarenrae who i follow and i wanted to bring you here because i wanted to share it with you (sighs) how are you feeling i would wow that's a lot how long have you been having visions in terms of this happening with me and what are your thoughts on jb and she knows about all this as well well i think i was at first shocked and i feel like i need to apologize for my trepidation and wariness at first bless you just little fairies sneezing fairies around here you usually don't you just hear them it's okay you said you've had some successes in releasing this thing how do you define this ritual is this under any sort of faith that you have it sure is but they'll come back again is there any way to get rid of them forever so you want to perform the exorcism on me well this is something that i'll have to think about we'll have to talk about it with everybody else especially if it involves them as well do i know nature check okay let me find a d20 oh ten you know i could talk to keyleth about that she would know and thank you for telling me all of this i'm very grateful that you're here and even though our last name has a reputation i'm proud to be a trickfoot i think we can make that happen well let's go back i have some thinking to do oh yes she is oh of course are we still going oh oh great i got some details too well i think-- i would love to get everybody together and just talk some stuff out yeah just like us yeah it is very large i feel like i don't need this much room well we do get along very well so i talked to-- and i know you got information too-- i talked to ogden and he told me some stuff that's a little disturbing but i guess you know way back in our family there were these brothers and one of them sort of was overcome with jealousy and he killed the other one and basically long story short our family has had a curse because of that action and ogden wants to perform an exorcism on me to get rid of this thing but i don't feel any different i don't feel like i have anything and he said you know we would all have to be a part of it and go on a mountaintop while there's a full moon and i don't know no no no anything's possible i just-- i don't feel like they're lying unless yeah i don't feel like they're telling the whole truth but i think something's there and i can't seem to get to the bottom of it no i haven't yet that's a very good analogy yes what if-- how much of that potion do you have i mean gnomes are small what if we give them all a shot i understand i think i thought-- i don't even know what that word means like if you were to just define avarice i mean i don't even-- he said that we go to the highest mountain we have to wait 'til a full moon you have to have it be hallowed ground and just sort of set up a ritual and he said maybe we could get help from whomever and i was thinking of vax and i don't know this is so beyond anything that i know i guess this sounds so ridiculous as i'm saying it out loud i feel like i like the mind-reading serum we could just see we have four days 'til a full moon i think you're allowed to be there well hold on well okay yeah if it comes down to that everybody we have to know that that has to be-- i have no idea that's-- i feel like that would be an upgrade no i doubt that's what it is i'm intrigued by this mind-reading serum all of them and astra yes and to not go when it's a full moon so we don't actually have to do it but we can set it up well i feel like they wouldn't be as on-guard with you is there anything-- do one of you guys wanna-- can one of you guys check me to see if there's something in there that i don't know vax deaw sarenwae (laughter) tonight i'll see if maybe i can get some answers but should we-- do we do this tonight this mind-reading serum and just so you guys know i've been discussing with what vex knows about it as well i think from what he said it's like a bunch of shapes come out and we would all have to fight them shades shades shades i forgot about that my b we don't know okay no i mean i talk about everything with you guys of course i chew on my own toenails i mean no i mean i think about one time with scanlan-- no you guys know this when i got in a lot of trouble for taking a shit on that bed or killing the guy with the mace or sometimes i'll go to a brothel but i don't do anything that bad i don't know i don't know if there's anything in there okay well when should we leave are there any other clerics that we know okay maybe we go ask them and say-- the family i mean it sounds crazy but maybe we just go up there go through the motions so i'll go to them at dinner okay so we've had some discussions and i think it'll take us a little bit of time to get up there and do whatever setting-up you need to do on the top of the mountain so we were thinking if you guys are okay with this of leaving tomorrow morning it's in four days okay that just sounds like someone who's an asshole i don't feel any of these things i say what you say that is what i say i say you know what i'm bored and i think we should do it even if it's hogwash no offense for science do you just tuck it in to make it smell nice it's a waste of 500 battlemap over there that means there's another one over there with ogden saying they're ready can i just be alone in the tent for a second i think to not be frightened two seconds just quietly just sort of muttering to myself or not to myself to sarenrae i don't know what this is i just hope that you're here and watching and please be by my side and guide this ritual if it is your will okay i'm ready gnomish common undercommon dwarvish this music pike fashion tank okay am i able to get back into the circle how far am i all right okay okay okay come on gil don't fuck me gil you fucked me gil four all right then i will cast spirit guardians into the circle and i will have them attack it's okay yes get 'im that's like-- yeah-- oh no don't you look travis step back step back motherfuckers well that's a turn of events okay am i close to-- who's the closest gnome can i get to them okay i'm going to-- go up to her and i'm going to put my mace up to her throat and say-- (laughs) yeah how many pastries did you steal i'm going to say what the fuck is going on i know this is not real where's intimidation 11 damn it okay (laughs) oh shit yeah i know can i-- how accurate can i be with a guiding bolt is that dependent on-- oh shit yeah fuck i'm gonna drop the mace on her foot i guess so (groans) i'm so mad fuck oh doty's not finished walking yet doty keep going ogden where's the diamond no it wasn't it's-- ogden that was bullshit god damn it 15 is he still in the ball push him out further i trusted you i put myself out there and i trusted you she's gonna break some legs it's okay surprise them i'm going to walk over to jb she's tangled i'm going to slowly start untangling her hi jb for starters-- okay that's fine i'm sorry i didn't spend more time with you but this is unacceptable this is not how you treat family and if anything i hope you learn from this what do you want what do you want from me tell me and i'll give it to you it doesn't have to be but you're very smart i think there's more for you in this life than you know i'm going to walk over to johann and astra money oh i know that was on purpose oh i'm so mad where's ogden does he still have the diamond with him well i'm sad okay ogden you're not listening to me because you're unconscious (laughter) i'm going to go over and backhand his face hi listen yeah okay so this wrecked me so here's what we're going to do i'm going to send you guys on your way i'm going to take out my purse of money i'm giving you all my money stop don't say anything i want you and i want astra and i want johann to leave and i never want to see you again jb is going to stay here with me we're going to teach her things i will put her through school and her and i together will change the trickfoot name but if i ever see any of you again i will fucking kill you all good call bastards there actually is a curse on our family it's called diabetes (laughter) oh man i was-- after the last game i was like i feel so bad i treated them so badly we all have work early so we're in the same boat
