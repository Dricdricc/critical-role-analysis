(quick sigh) i know i run after her wait listen i know how angry you are-- --but we need you here today so he can at least have more of a chance to be the father that you've always wanted him to be you have no idea how much he loves you that may be true but not as much as you as long as it takes uh yes okay i guess we'll go ahead and get started (sighs shakily) i have a couple things to say but i know i'm already-- i reach in my pocket and i pull out a little doll and-- scanlan i don't know if you remember this but you gave this to me and it's a little doll of you which is very appropriate but when i died this saved my life because you gave it to me and i didn't know that you had put healing words in it it saved me and i hope that today i can return the favor i place that next to him i prepared a poem i don't have it memorized so hold on here lies scanlan the bard a gnome who sang soft but died hard to anyone who hears us both far and wide bring us back our dirty friend at least one more time he may not be tall or brute or rough he may be little but his heart is buff we are a party and every party needs a clown without our friend to reign us in we'll burn down your whole fucking town (all laugh) you see i love this gnome very much he's small like me but he's touched he's raided and slain he's pooped while he sang but if he's gone forever i won't be the same now that he's learned he's a dad the journey that all of us had cannot be in vain will not be in waste please scanlan open your eyes and see your daughter's face okay oh man okay okay no way two holy moly Â that responsibility is so scary it happens so lootcrate (everyone laughs) it's such a cool thing what they have this month you know if you love power rangers and leegos i love leegos can't do it like sam i'll go with grog and scanlan don't come to my room we can't-- that's-- the earrings-- i'm going to stay with scanlan for a bit just for the night do i hear them at all on the other side of the door okay 19 okay i'm gonna peek my head out the door hey what are you drinking and why didn't you bring some to me you are--that must be like an intelligence serum probably not grog but thank you can i insight check him since i knew since i could hear what was going on okay 18 one for me should we all sit on the bed around scanlan like a slumber party oh my god what were you guys talking about out there if i can be so rude to ask great great what do you mean they don't always work they don't we've been very fortunate we've been very fortunate what did you-- why do you ask kerr swamp ass it's a thing i remember very well do you feel-- i understand (whispers) yeah we could play a prank on him did you want to go through his things well i mean-- i actually would agree 'cause what if there's something you know that he needs our help with but feels weird about asking of course okay what's your idea oh okay okay can i go grab one of my-- i'm gonna go grab one of my nightgowns is my nightgown a little big on him (all laugh) (singing) more to love that's right i got all the games what are you thinking okay okay (gasps) we'll have an art party all right so i'll start undressing him five years good good good good good i'm so glad you're back sleep is the best medicine some people say that (all laugh) aaaaay he was talking about his butt getting sweaty we all agreed it happens (make flashback sounds) he stayed in the raven queen's temple i know that i think he did i-- i don't know i was up in the room that i-- he stayed there when we left so he could still be there i'm not sure figured it was appropriate when he woke up that he would-- not anything-- no he just-- we wanted to make sure he stayed-- that he didn't-- --didn't roll off the bed keep him there yes grand what is it grand poobah that is adorable awww no none taken eyyy those are mine i can give her the shoes that i was wearing what are they what's she giving me oh shit thanks for giving those back (all laugh) i-- you're great (all laugh) we'll say the words that face will be burned into my brain (all laugh) okay oh that's right rustic it's a great idea yes go look at the garden and temple i like it a little overgrown i didn't get into it wait he said we can't open the box right or did he say i know okay no i just wanna know for sure maybe it's actually somebody requesting that we do something that is nice then which i feel like never happens (all laughs) i don't trust anybody anymore zofah was the box already checked for traps can i check it for traps okay i got an eight i just don't trust anybody anymore okay i'm not good at-- okay let's go let's go i just feel like this is something fishy about it it just seems too easy you know too simple all right i'm sorry i just-- (sighs) or i could be killing all of us what if i just take a peek or like open it to a mirror it might hurt me shake it listen divine intervention what if we bury it and it turns into something crazy i don't know but that's what a shyster does you know they tell you things to make you feel bad to buy their magazines (all laugh) just everyone everyone in whitestone you guys haven't been there long enough yes i know all right let's go bury the you know i'll carry it (all laugh) okay okay no we got her name right so we'll make her a little tombstone we'll do a whole thing then we're gonna make it nice put

who she is they just wanted to be on their way is it better to open a box and put the ashes out or is it-- it does well i-- matt can i ask you a question (all laugh) is it respectful to-- -- when you're at a place of another god's worship to-- i know we did at the resurrection ritual but to bring another god into it oh fuck it do i get advantage i have no idea i was just saying 'cause---- was in the raven queen but we were using sarenrae as well i feel like melora and sarenrae-- percy all right well are we going to dig a hole or we just-- so we don't know what we're planting here so if
