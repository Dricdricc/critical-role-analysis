pleasure is all mine i was a deckhand on the broken howl and we heard of many adventures that you had and maybe you've heard of the broken howl maybe you haven't but-- it's a pleasure to ride on an airship so thanks she can fly selfie staff well what about selfie staffs if you guys need any help i can totally help just so you know pike grew up on the outskirts of town near the bramblewood her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation thievery destruction and trickery left them with the curse of the last name trickfoot sarenrae the goddess of healing and redemption had other plans for pike's great-great-grandfather wilhand who left his family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed the course of the trickfoot family wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal whether it was animals people or even flowers she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken she studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic she lived a peaceful life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead abandoned by his herd wilhand went to pike for help she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could bringing him back to life when he awoke she discovered his name was grog strongjaw after that they were the best of friends a rather unlikely pair little did she know that in a few years' time grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death after being killed in battle pike felt angry she wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again she spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the broken howl gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other this time pike is ready (gasps) oh is this a challenge take a sipsy can't we add a little bit extra square footage to the magic carpet and i'm going to hold his waist you are you are whoa (gasps) matt what up four hey it's not bad for the cleric to go last we could just attach it to all of ourselves and where we go one we go all if they take one they take all of us it wouldn't be able to lift all of us come on advantage because you're a dragonborn the guy riding him's going to be like ahhh bunny go bye-bye how high up are we and how much does the bunny weigh let's do the math yeah okay how long is the ship just so you know what i'm looking at right now i'll show you again this ship right here yeah that one no okay so would you say maybe this area would be about like 60 feet yeah how-- where would-- okay okay i would like to reach down-- stay where i am-- and touch the floor of the ship and cast hallow which basically infuses a 60 foot radius with holy power and any creatures or anything can't harm anything inside the radius god dang it (laughter) scratch that okay so here's what we're going to do should have done it when we first got on the ship okay that's good to know would have been cool instead i'm going to guiding bolt this guy right here no wait the flying guy right here yeah cool i'll guiding bolt-- i can't do that griffon up there can i 120 feet yeah okay i'll do that oh man that's a one what a fail of a motherfucking turn (laughter) can i still move if i use my sprinter's boots okay i'm going to sprinter's boots over to vex and i'm going to give her a superior healing potion oh i can't give it to her here's a superior healing potion a potion turn wait so she has to use that on her turn then all right let's just go past this really fast (laughter) let's move on i just healed her we had a week off getting our wiggles out kill him kill him and wasn't he prone come on where are you at i can captain the ship if i need to okay so i would like to try to create a spiritual weapon kind of in the vein of-- -- yondu's little arrow he would whistle at but like a really big spear like a big version of that all right so i want to pierce it through that guy yeah 18 seven i know i mean because of how heavy it is-- but wait i want to do it at a higher level i was thinking of doing it at a level four and i know that does 1d8 but then was it just 1d6 because-- one more time spell using a slot of third level or higher the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd it's a three or no it's a two yeah okay so it would be 15 total but then would the since so then would i roll the d8 instead of the sixes for that last one yeah all right i understand okay yeah i'm getting a donut death by bunny if these are like he said a distraction liam where are you at are you okay health-wise so nobody hired you well come here well what's your name teera how old are you four gold really the box is fine for sure should we do insight i don't know i know all right all right yeah yeah i did
