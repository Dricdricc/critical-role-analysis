hey can you hear me yay (laughter) i wish i could restore you isn't there-- yeah okay yeah if that's what you want grog i don't think that's a bad idea of course i will grog what's he saying listen we did that before you knew this sword we're all strong together you were strong before it and you'll be strong after it i grab him by the hand so he can't go anywhere scanlan i don't think this is a good idea look at him he's getting all weird i know he definitely does this when he needs to go poo but this is so much worse no yes it's five wait i think i had a plus one somewhere with a plus four it's 17 can i swing my other hand up and try to pull more 14 i think this is not a good idea grog this is something you wanted to do you need to fight it well i think we could both do something but i want grog to fight this then if it doesn't work i have an idea no grog stop just one moment and i look him in the eyes i cast greater restoration still have another slot left will that work i'm casting it at 7th-level because that's all i have left do i get an advantage i have yeah it's five so nine marisha and you die oh you're back to light gray again you look great you made a decision and i felt it was the right thing to do yeah it's there i think that was a great idea yes it was very smart we shall away bidet how do you feel i would like to go see my temple whoa it's so wonderful to see your face okay well it looks a bit better than i thought it would it's done well we all did (giggles) yes (sighs) i take it percy what is this i mean i somewhat know what it is i will keep this at the very least very far from you could you text me the book i don't have it with me but i-- i have a cup and it's a vintage cup i don't need to talk about this (laughter) well i'd like to come with you guys for a little bit because frankly i don't really want to be alone for a while oh p-- oh grog i was going to call you poobah but then i wanted to say your real name because he's learning he learns something new every day i'm in well i think you should pick a card and we deal with one as of right now and then maybe i'll pick one later ugh just pick one time travel there's a couple of things if you wanted to go somewhere sneak away just for a little bit for about an hour i want to go-- not deep into the woods where percy and vex are but somewhere that's pretty for about an hour and i'll make my way back you are a beautiful creature this might be strange but i give him a hug i sit next to him i came out here to build a little something so i'm glad to have you out here for a little bit thank you for staying with me (sighs) i feel like grog would be so happy right now to be around a wolf i give him a scratch behind his ear oh that's a good boy i give out a little howl that was for my friend vax goodbye after a bit i head back wait as i'm walking back do i see him at all i rolled a natural 20 he's out in the open i stand and watch for a moment oh shit hello (laughter) my internet crashed at the worst fucking time okay so you disappeared oh no wait what okay maybe we leave it alone then are we leaving can i grab keyleth and vex real quick i'll take them to the little spot where i was in the woods okay so hey i put something together it's dumb but i made a bench and i put vax's name on it and i didn't want to make him a headstone because that seems so final maybe he's still around somewhere i also have these i take out two of his feathers that i grabbed and i thought you could put this with the feathers in your hair vex and keyleth you could do something with this i'm sure you could make it look a little prettier than it is but-- maybe we should just leave it here i think he would too okay i'll let you guys stay i just wanted to do one more thing okay i walk over to where scanlan is wait is grog on the trip or was that-- hey scanlan how are you doing now that was bad wasn't it the bugbear you said i thought i forgot about that maybe listen i'm glad you're alive thank you for saving us all i don't really have a whole lot to say i care for you a lot and i wanted to let you know that me too well i actually was going to ask you the same thing oh no can you hear me at all sorry my internet keeps going out i don't know what grog's plans are but i do know if there were any adventuring to be had that her and grog got to on some adventures together and that he always has a place in my home and i know i would love to-- i'm sure at this point fully rebuild the temple in vasselheim i think things have gone well with scanlan oh man i'm getting so emotional well i think if we spend enough time together maybe i don't know can we see what else life has for us together that doesn't have to mean anything more i know your life what you like to do and i'll give you freedom i think there's no one i would rather spend the rest of my days with besides my pal grog i think you get a two-for-one deal i think at some point i ask scanlan for his hand in marriage what's that no sarenrae's very accepting of other gods no
