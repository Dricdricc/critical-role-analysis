what are these actually a lot of people tell me that i look like him anyway him or-- i get-- from the '80s band it's a guy justin george i can't think of a song i'll think of it i wish we were going to the north pole we are going to mexico we're going to a place never we've almost been dating for five years and we've never gone on a vacation together boy george boy george i get it a lot i get that you have an actual set i say at the end of all this we all pick one huzzah all right so i followed in the beginning-- did the guy pick the deck in vasselheim or were you-- matt and so i went with grog to vasselheim and because i wanted to go and read and work on some things-- yes i ended up fighting (laughs) because i saw him fight and i was like oh i should probably just try it and did well i'm the second champion under grog do it no to fight we didn't end up doing it we just shook-- -- and i would win so we just decided not to do it two monsters of a feather also in that time which was a five-month period we had a lot of lessons and taught grog how to read just a little bit wait what did you ask i'm so tired i took some time to learn how to be just a little bit more stealthy just did a little bit of training not a ton but maybe we'll see i also went to check on great-great-grandpappy wilhand to see how he was doing and he's doing fine he's older oh of course always i've totally forgot about fassbender didn't he die oh shit i forgot about fassbender he's keeping him safe he probably helped build the house that's okay it was technically his i also sent a little bit of money to -- i don't know where they are but i hired somebody to send a letter and some money to some of my family yeah and what else oh last but certainly not least we opened up a bakery it's called-- tell 'em and we have many many items sun treats bear claws angel food cake so many treats and treasures so tary keyleth vex and i just decided on a drunken evening we were like we should open up a bakery it does yeah i did try looking for scanlan at one point but i couldn't find him yeah yes and what was the last thing oh we went to go see-- -- something great yeah so that's what i did on my year of break you are so great at baking what did we name the profiteroles again your hair is lovely you're kind you're very giving yeah because i've sailed there before i'll teach you the ropes (laughter) okay (laughter) okay just kidding i don't say that oh man yes do you have any specials aaa discounts tenth night free situation how about some free drinks i used to come here on a ship and we used to bring you guys a lot of supplies so you know (gasping) 31 it's 12 maybe how about-- if we don't get free food what about-- two 14 okay tokens thanks ooh are you going to join i want to i got a five i definitely didn't find a pearl i rolled a five i found a boob oh you should go change i want to get my hair braided with beads on the end (cheering) and grog hi could we get our hair-- yours looks amazing could we get some hair braids tight and then going down with some gems and sparkles in it and same here on his beard yeah it looks really good do you want to add any jewels in it earrings and stuff like how she has i want all of it just all of it what does all of it cost well no let's not get carried away my hair is already so long let's put blue in there oh well-- yeah so how does that break down for my hair versus his well you know what i am a very big supporter of small businesses so support small business and i will give you 120 gold great just 120 say again just some strips you know just some strips on the white so it pops out just like-- you know dealer's choice just get creative and do what you want it's awesome ooh that's pretty cool weren't you in the shower it's so good hello oh come in okay (laughter) yes ooh okay okay okay okay okay (gasps) naturally yeah (gasps) so something magic comes out of it when you pick one can i pick one yeah wait it can be dangerous okay oh okay what that sounds like the best thing ever the crossroads (gasps) should we-- whoa should we pick a card wait what do you mean this sword gave you a headache grog was it evil okay that's a-- that's a red flag so it didn't talk back to you it fought on its own a guy that you met you made him just rich and amazing a deck of fortune i mean i don't yeah i don't know if i have the knowledge but i'll look at it natural 20 (cheering) plus one so 21 can i tell which cards are good and which cards are bad i was just checking (laughter) i feel like i've heard of something like this before but sometimes you can choose a card that will do very bad things so it's like a 50/50 chance that you could get something very good like you have your fortune change you become a king all of this thing-- or you get a magical sword or if maybe someone-- you could just die instantly i don't know maybe something along those lines (strained) oh it just sounds so fun though (strained) oh i don't know what to do well do you want to pull one or should i pull one or should we not what could be that bad i mean if someone were to die we could do a resurrection spell (sighs) i don't know what to do i don't know if we should i don't know if we should test the fates let's flip a coin yeah i have a coin okay heads or tails okay so one is heads okay so what's what 20 we pick a card one we do not 20 we don't pick a card you are not here that's both of those you said we'd pick a card both sides yeah one we pick a card 20 we don't who picks the card or should we-- okay okay i'm going to check it oh we don't pick a card okay oh you don't pick a card either you know what it's safer this way i think so because what if we would've gotten something bad did you want me to hold onto it or do you want to hold onto it i'm just afraid you're going to pick it and be alone do not pick it alone who did you make the promise to well you live your life how you want to-- yeah yeah yeah okay just

what's going on well oh man okay check your pockets check your pockets yes yeah but i mean i haven't seen them in a very long time since i was but a kid well because he was different and had a different life plan and because he became a cleric and was the first of-- i don't know how far back i don't even know yeah and he saw that i was and decided-- we left he took me when i was little and we left there was a lot that happened but i didn't know where they were because they travel i don't know i heard some things with some discussions i had tonight and i need to figure out if they're true or not we'll figure out in the next few days just to see what's going on how do you know about that you did what did he say yes this is a thing okay he didn't talk about the family he wanted to be separate from them and he didn't want me to be influenced by them at all maybe both can we from here we could as you guys know wilhand is a little-- he's in his older years but we could try to keep it quick wilhand's older than ogden let's circle back tomorrow and while they're doing the tour maybe we can pop over real quick and i think that would be better than him seeing them here yeah they would be pretty fascinated by that i will i'll just be a little late yeah
