hey yeah no that's completely a misunderstanding of things that's not what happened well-- i feel like i didn't need to be in there anymore you know i don't-- ugh i feel like-- 11 it's good to see you guys too i have a little bit of a problem with authority and i didn't want to be caught in a small and confined space and then that ended up happening immediately after i ran away they sent out horses i'm not that fast but i did fuck up a few of the guards by accident  where's toya wait so who killed him it was him what's happened with toya how is she oh well-- i mean i kind of go on my own but-- (laughs) you're very funny you could always try to take it yeah you do look pretty strong i mean you're just a little bit bigger than me but i still think i could probably take you what about your sword i think it's something that kids play i have a better version of that game we can play it later no i'm just going to float around like i usually do i will toya what are your plans what do you want to do i mean i'll say it i don't know if you will but i think that little girl is creepy (laughter) yeah yeah maybe for a little bit but i've got some things i need do so where are you going again where's where northeast i would love a map okay we'll go shopping with you oh are you scared of me well i thought you were nott the brave but you guys were there together because you knew each other before it just depends where in the south actually you know i'm just-- i'll make my way wherever we go and maybe i'll not stay with you the whole time but i don't like you know-- yeah i don't-- groups and things-- uh no i like to have my freedom no i don't mean it like that i just want to make my own way sometimes (chuckles) yeah that's right what happened to you was this a test of some sort yeah i think i'll join you oh i did actually want to see that map i think that's a great idea seeing me see a map is something pretty special maybe not all of them that is so beautiful i also really like what you've done with the place do you have a deal you know if we got all of them that seems pretty high right that seems pretty high for a healing potion three how do we know if it's good quality though can i give it a sample well you might as well make another one i'm not going to let my friend experience it alone you don't want to go to zadash is that right yasha sam it's like ash with an -ay oh i'm not going to kill you all right well that was very nice of you thank you i take out a book that i have and in between some of the pages is a four-leaf clover i'll take the flowers and i'll put them in between the other pages and i'll put it away i think i need to stay here just a little bit longer but i will meet you guys there at some point i just don't think i can leave here until i'm told i can no i just-- i have things that i need to do-- i have reasons i can stay i just need to converse with somebody to see where my next step leads no yes no it's not him no when you get to zadash maybe send me a note or maybe i'll be there i just have to do a couple things okay that sounds like a plan hopefully soon i never know i'll try i don't think any of them are watching
