it feels like it was-- like it's a one-of-a-kind watercolor like that's what it-- up close it's crazy sorry i love it so much wow so light and i would know i'm a cleric er what what if we save them forever do you at least have a late flight you never went to brothels or anything like that then i guess did you have a good year together sort of i guess that was the last time we saw you have things been good just in case you decide to leave again which is probably highly probable i don't know just in case i'm sure you look beautiful but that's blowing a 7th-level spell how long does it take to hike up there what happened what happened what happened yes yes she got hurt no you'll be coming body pillow that's a good idea you're just going to go in there scanlan how are you going to do this how do you know well i'm not going with you wait i'll go with him i'm going to go with you i'm keeping my eye on him investigation did you say i'm sure he found something 11 no well yeah let's go back no no don't push your luck none that we could see did you scanlan you should've seen something did you look well i was just making sure you weren't going to run away so i was preoccupied should we just go in i don't think so and then i think we also put one on the top of the loot for the dragon yeah i don't think it alerts anybody 30 that's never going to happen again i tug on vax's shirt just to let him know i'm there i say we keep going if it's an emergency we can all jump into the mansion maybe is everybody okay to keep going you sneaky 22 coming right up i'm here did you save any for me i take out my mace and get ready a glyph of warding yes we can ooh chod huh are we close to the faces at all still on the way back great i throw up a glyph of warding right there a gift for someone give me just one second i don't know if it slipped underneath you know what we don't have time so maybe we can just hop into the mansion there's also the spa right so basically it's one of those meals that you're still hungry when you eat it all do we have any chalices in here yeah that's fine i'll volunteer undead is my favored terrain i could but what's the point if we find your friends i can talk to them if they're dead that's not a bad idea same it's okay i feel starving can you have eggs or is that not vegan well i'm fine i'm just finding myself a little angry and i'm trying not to be i know i don't like it but i can't help it what should i do yeah i think it's just because i didn't really know them maybe it was easier to just let them go and i wasn't as angry as i am with him no i'm just nervous i know what she'll say and have me do and i just want to be-- i don't want to do it i just want to be mad for a while i guess but i don't know i guess just seeing him again slowly but surely i'm not as mad but-- i know i just feel like now i'm acting like i'm mad almost around him i don't know he's making me feel so many different kinds of emotions i'm confused okay that's a good idea i would feel very bad if something happened to him and i didn't say anything i mean if i died then i just wouldn't know i guess it's fine i don't care okay well that's true thank you i know it is hard well good night okay well good night you two i go and i knock on grog's door oh that's right i stand next to him and stare at chod-- lionel in the sand pit grog i know that you probably feel replaced but there's no way he could fill your shoes he could-- i mean but his feet are a little bit too big you know your feet are just right i have an idea how about we go get a bunch of blankets the ones out of my room we'll just make a fort by the fireplace we'll make a better spot i just talked to vex and she said that maybe if something were to happen tomorrow maybe it would be better to just say some things so that you're not you know thinking about it if somebody dies no i'll be fine i promise just i guess scanlan maybe do you feel like you want to talk to him i think i'm angry with him but i can tell you're also angry with him so i'll stay mad at him as long as you are but i feel like maybe he feels a little bad that was weird well you know what we should do we should just tomorrow-- that's definitely an option but i feel like maybe we could just try to be better than him maybe you could really show off and show him that you are better and that we're better and we're better friends and you know that he should come back and hang out with us he should we've got to make him remember we've got to make him remember how great we are and what he's lost all the tricks oh sorry we didn't realize you were awake we make a blanket fort by the fireplace can i peek out the door there's just 20 or so skeletons out there this is the perfect opportunity maybe we take care of it ourselves let's do it okay you can yell pike don't be so brave and then i can say something like but grog you're too strong i don't know let me workshop it grog you're too strong you're too strong you're just going to kill them all anyway should we just wing it okay ready on the count of three i know you can okay i'm going to get my mace ready two three grog you're so strong i'm going to start swinging my mace i start swinging my mace of disruption can i just do this as i go through yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i forgot i haven't done this in a minute with undead okay it says when you hit a fiend or undead with this magic weapon the creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage so oh okay so 17 and 22 okay so i don't have all of the dice out so with undead i also roll an additional 2d6 so am i doing four how many okay so 1d6 plus 2d8 is just one strike sorry i haven't done this in a while 1d6 plus six and 2d8 is what i have written down for divine strike okay so 18 yep okay 14
