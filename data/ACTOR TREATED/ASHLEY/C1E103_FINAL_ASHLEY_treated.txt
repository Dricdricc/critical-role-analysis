can i try to grab his hand and slap him across the face 27 what did it say if i were to cast locate object would that work okay i think i've located it i can't see it but i know what direction it's in i don't know so it seems like it's in the ground or it's been moved okay can i start digging i put it in the box that's my favorite thing you've ever said hold on i cast cure wounds for his eye do you want me to hold it i feel like i'm going to hold onto it in case it tries to attach itself to you again and you pull out your eyeball again we didn't how much can you make can i take a peek how will we know it's there it has to be something small how do you know if they're there did you just point at me and tell me to come to you so you can make me disappear and come back no it makes me nervous scanlan i want to keep our eyes on it (laughter) are we down how's everybody doing i think am let's see if i wrote it down here oh yeah i forgot i'm almost dead okay mass cure wounds you all heal 31 points it's something should we try killing an animal and seeing how many diamonds you get out of it do you want to speak with dead before bed or do you want to sleep on it no i feel like you're going to make plans what happened i'll take it 19 i'm going to try to hop up and hide in the tree i guess i'm looking awake in the tree i'm going to keep watching i run down from the tree i don't want him to see me oh 22 stringbean hi we're in the feywild where did you just come from i did know that we're trying to figure out how to save you i don't know that's okay vax can i put my hand on his chest and see if i feel a heartbeat do i feel a heartbeat that's a natural 20 i see them all the time okay i can't figure it out sometimes when people are very athletic they have very slow heart rates you're very in shape i'm going to climb up the tree and wake up keyleth come down from the tree real quick everything's okay i grab her hand it's okay come with me vax is at the bottom of the tree he has a heartbeat vax what do you like to do with my hair do you remember anything from when you woke up i know but what if it does something-- vax i don't either you have something new on your chest keyleth i climb back up the tree are you okay i was watching and then i saw him walk out of the tree of sorts and i think it's him and he's obviously naked okay maybe you would be able to tell to see what's going on i think you should come down it will be okay okay okay vax you're going to be okay take my hand this is going to be okay we're going to figure this out grog keep it just in case i'm going to cast turn undead vax i don't know how you did it or how she did it but something's happened i've never seen anything like this before in my life you're there and you're here what did you say what was your deal or maybe you're free from that deal i can ask that doesn't mean we're going to get it what do you mean you have a very different connection with your god 19 shit what was i going to say what if i were to channel divinity and try to make a prayer and be like hey can we come up there right quick i don't know i like this idea it's a little crazy but i like it we'll work our way through in a montage a god-tage i have advantage because of gnome cunning 14 can i greater restoration them i don't know how you did it before because i don't think i was here we were in the feywild for a little while and then took a nap there and then we came here i'll go over and touch grog too she gave you a vecna compass stop off go to wine country to sarenrae that's okay i'm heavier than i look pure muscle it looks lovely in here you guys have really kept it up quite nice not all by myself yeah that's a compliment (laughter) sheila (sighs) we're trying to figure out the best way to what am i trying to say here we're trying to go to sarenrae but actually go to her not in the sense of the mind actually walking up and saying hello when i started i realized this is so weird okay i could try of course but maybe he will know which plane she's on and we can head there sometimes she doesn't talk to me i can always try since we're in here i'll go ahead and try you know what let me say a prayer real quick sheila percy it's fine you don't need to let's all take a knee well i'm back here and this is so beautiful i'm sure you've seen and have seen what's happened where we were and i know the last time we talked you warned me and told me that you wouldn't be there but i think we're past the point of being able to do this on our own just our mortal selves and we need bigger help might i ask for (sighs) your-- please help us i don't know what else to say this is beyond us now i immediately take a knee thank you for letting me come here just to see you and-- we will come to you did you guys see anything wow well i went there i went to the island of renewal that's where she is and she gave this to me over the earring shut up scanlan no it's not that was cool vax you have a very different relationship with your god but-- awesome that was cool she was so beautiful and just glowed no and i just can't even describe it she just glowed and it felt like-- do you remember the movie contact (laughter) yes the old scroll contact where she gets to the beach and her dad is there that's what it felt like i need to go back there let's all go 23 i didn't think it was going to work sheila i think-- it's wonderful to see you vincent i'm so sorry she went to go get you i think we might be okay and we got some answers you obviously have heard of vecna so basically we're going to need a lot of help and please stay in prayer i don't feel like i want to hopefully we will please pray for us thank you keep up the good work you're doing just all the great stuff it happened so fast
