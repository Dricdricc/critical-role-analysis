little nervous about going there because i don't know how that would affect me just selfishly speaking i feel like maybe it wouldn't have been good maybe i feel like it would have affected me in certain ways or you know i just don't know no it's probably safe that i didn't you have a little bit of a glow you ate a soul what did it taste like percy what do you mean when in hell-- what is it i know why and i think word on the street is that you completed that mission i just heard on the street from that guy he just told me what just happened it's crazy (laughter) perfect timing perfect timing if you guys don't mind just pick up the rest of the carts all of it i haven't seen them in so long okay so much stuff to do and discuss whatever he was just a little bit rude to me so i don't really mind it's fine don't be mad i just feel like he wasn't very appreciative and i was working very hard and you know how strong i am what i lack in height i make up for in strength let's go drink oh who was your best-- oh no tary with some flirting ooh flirting can take your mind off lots of things do you have someone in mind that you're going to flirt with and maybe just don't go right to mate you know you're my mate right from the get-go because that might freak somebody out well there it is that's what we're looking for ooh i have an idea what if we have a contest whoever takes her home-- -- or just-- i don't like having a woman be a part of a contest that sounds terrible i just mean-- i'm not trying to-- moral compass i'm not-- it's still the same thing maybe i've become terrible win the affections of yeah okay can i be in this contest i think it's a great idea oh no that's not a good lesson to learn oops how come did you like it there did you get anything out of it you met a bear did they make friends with trinket you've picked up a woman before but just not in a bar wait what did you say what did i miss what whoa yay you don't even have to do anything you can
