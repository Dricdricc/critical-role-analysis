woo-hoo yeah whatever getting a tan i finally splurged on your episodes marisha i did and i've liked all of the things that you liked now i'm going to watch hector's i wasn't a part of that cow episode but i remember watching it and i was like this is ludicrous i was laughing so hard i had projectile tears i was like this is the weirdest thing that's happened in this game probably sully who plays kurt the main guy-- or no we'll start with jane doe i think she would be a fighter straight-up fighter class i think kurt weller sully would be a barbarian i think zapata would be a rogue i would probably be a bard or probably still a cleric yeah so i am it's called dungeons and dragons put it in where we can just stick it right in outreach our outreach campaign i know they're coming in fast coming in hot i don't know if pike could do it even if they were really bad or something was terrible i feel like pike would try anything to not kill one of the members no i will not tonight is an exception my friend yeah there's still something in them that should still be there i don't think there's anything that can make her kill somebody except tonight i feel like pike would've probably stayed hanging out in the bramblewood living with wilhand i feel like she's pretty small-town i think this is such a huge adventure for pike and the only thing that brought pike out of it was because of grog was a family and being like well i guess i'll leave try to help him and find him i don't think she would've explored that much she would've stayed so vox machina brought out the best marisha and yes such a good theme song i feel like it would be so fun to be an evil character (evil voice) we should do an evil one-shot that was so i was like this has got to be it i actually didn't know that i didn't know that you thought of the titles because they're fantastic it makes sense i don't know who else i thought would've done it besides you would you cry i would cry that was horrible it's true i feel like we've all become the characters so much it's been fun i almost still feel like pike is a little bit of act one even with everything that's happening i'm still a little like ooh there's more there yeah but it's getting there someone asked what led to ashley and travis deciding to link their backstories together that was actually not my decision that was how he put it together which i thought was really cool because i came to the second game that you guys played which is so crazy because how our friendship in-game has turned out is so huge in the game for me which i wonder if that wasn't the story how different that would have been but that's such a huge part of the story for me so crazy there's a lot of things because i haven't even gotten to deal with this motherfuck yet about what's been going on with him him being vax not liam but still the split-second where i was like shit i got it wrong no i didn't this is actually a cool question this is for matt and i would like to know this has there been something in-game that's happened that has absolutely shocked you where you were like this is something that's never happened in a game i've dmed that was the worst hey rude it's going not well at all this is very not good we did pretty well considering that was the worst cliffhanger of a game i know i know they asked-- when i brought the mug to set because i asked them i was like i want to have one mug that my character uses and they were like okay pick out a mug and i was like oh i already have one and i brought the critical role mug and they were like oh cool what is this and i was like just the coolest thing ever don't worry about it this is what i'm using but then i couldn't do it for so many episodes because it had to be cleared by nbc and they're like well what is this critical role and i'm like well so i had to go through and they're like can we use it i was like of course yeah and i was like well it's a dungeons & dragons game i play with my friends-- and then with the writers i think they started hearing about it some of them have started watching it which is so funny and then they started adding little stuff here and there about that my character plays dungeons & dragons and then the last one with the gnome cleric i didn't tell them that i just read the script yeah and then when i read the script the person who had written that episode he came over and he was like yeah because i watched it and i know you're a gnome cleric and i was like this is the best day ever (laughter) i like this one somebody asked what do you think is your character's biggest fault no he's not gosh pike is-- perfect just no faults whatsoever no gosh i think that with the death that was before the stream i think she felt like she was not as helpful in the group and i think that sticks with her with trying to be like i need to earn my place yeah i don't know she's got some weird stuff with her family which we haven't really gotten into because she comes from the deep gnomes they're a little bit of tricksters hence the last name trickfoot it probably would be the equivalent of coming from-- i don't want to say that because it sounds so judgmental never mind no you don't you do not need it there's so many questions ooh no i've already asked a lot hi laura hi twavis i don't like the sound of that how this turns out i know maybe we let him-- after we get you out run it would be really interesting with this group though if someone did have to reroll a character since we all do already know each other so well that would be a very interesting dynamic let's make it not happen i know we're probably all more awkward with it we're all like how do you feel i think because you guys had the maiden voyage you were the pioneers and we all learned from that moment of oh you can have moments like these and everybody has to not be 12 about it i know we were the worst we were the worst i think for me personally i still feel a little like a newbie in a way because they've played so many games consistently week after week and because of work i still feel a little rusty so for me there's a part of me not as pike that likes to watch things unfold first before making a move because i'm like can i do this i'm a little unsure sometimes that's ashley but i think i feel like pike is the same way but i feel like these things blur together but i think with pike it's almost better to hang back because of being a cleric because you can do a little clean-up after just who's hurt who can we protect and keep alive and keep in the battle there was another part to the question oh yes probably not i feel like with pike there's a lot of-- which we've had so many times talks in the game and out of game about how pike sometimes veers away from worshipping sarenrae and wants to do bad things i just want to do bad things with my friends hoodrat things with my friends sometimes she can't there are consequences well all right i don't think pike would ever be like you need to convert to sarenrae because you're a bad person so no no never ever ever done we're doing it because we could tell you the letter that letter was so lovely that in the game there was about five minutes where i wanted to cry sam wrote this letter but it was so beautifully written he knew nobody would see it except for me maybe unless i were to just post it and be a jerk about it i know you did you could have read it but it was paragraphs and paragraphs that were so beautifully written and that was a moment in the game for me where i was like does pike have-- whoa there could be a little something-- scanlan just because it was so beautiful it made me pause life is so complicated yes he might have cyrano de bergerac-ed me who knows that sounds a little weird i'm just going to give it to you gimme same so is ashley/pike people have asked this before but i actually like this question if you could play another character in-game who would you pick one of the other characters but you do so much damage yeah you peeked behind the veil he charmed your pants off it's a deep-rooted love we're all commies that's rad this has been one of my favorite shirts that they've put out it's so good what i completely misunderstood the vegetables of the virgins you did great people do keep asking who pike is in love with and same as what liam said we'll see it might not ever happen in game maybe it won't but she's in love with somebody it's something that happened prior to playing the show it was a moment that happened and feelings were formed it might not even be somebody in the group it could even be an npc character it's trinket it's trinket god you guys figured it out pullakeyleth pullakeyleth except if it's children (laughter) yeah i've got it down to a look instead of a word i think that was a moment in game of me with travis being stop it do not die again when i watched it back i was-- when i watched it back when i saw the little gif i was like yikes i was so intense do we have-- does this go towards anything like is this extra credit but it was the-- one of the funniest moments in the game it was-- for me i thought it was so funny which is terrible because you were just doing this amazing thing-- i know i think if i ever rolled another character it would be the most evil terrible person for me i thought it was kind of funny because you were like i just want to help and then he was like and you killed a child it was up there with the moment scanlan had the knife ready to go and then he kept going out the window by his scruff you have had so many of those moments and those are some of the best moments you've had so many of those where you're like guys i got this i'm here to help no she's the best that is not true do you have someone in your head though forget it just how do we kill the dragon and then we'll stop have you watched it man there's so many there's so many little ones where i'm like (groans) i love that bar episode so much so many spells it's so hard to keep track in the moment when you're stressed that's happened so many times where you're like and i'll show it to laura or travis and be like is this right because i'm behind oh okay okay okay that sounds awesome wow what seven right out of the motherfucking gate (singing) secrets and we are dealing with molten lava we don't know where vax is seriously okay so we're going to start-- i'm going to cast guardian of faith and i would like to place it-- it's ten feet i'm going to place it right there yeah and then i am going to cast for my bonus action shield of faith on myself which brings my armor class up by two points shield of faith is first i'm going to just kind of-- well he's there i'm going to stay i'll stay all right what's the-- guys come on (singing) shot through the heart 18 all right (singing) bring it on (laughing) yeah that hits that'll do pig that'll do okay oof okay well i got to heal myself because i have such low hit points i have a different plan now since that happened where did it go okay i'm going to do cure wounds on myself with a 3rd-level third what else am i going to do i'm going to move yeah i'm just going to do that and then move okay (counting) i'm going to move over here do you have to roll a natural 20 okay can i make my way to percy how close can i get to him i want to get very close i am going to inflict wounds because i can't use these necromancy spells in the regular games i'm gonna use them i'm a monstah you know what i'm going to do it at just second level yeah just second level which is only-- yeah that would be a 28 it was cocked 21 can i tuck back okay can i use my sprinter's boots i'm going to use my sprinter's boots and go back behind that wall where i was ooh she's making a whole lava pool remodeling break him break him (singing) give it to me baby uh-huh uh-huh what'd you say it was how many points okay write it down where'd he go i am going to walk over to him and i'm going to inflict wounds again third that would be 30 i'm not here to heal you i'm here to kill you 24 i'm going to move back behind the wall i can't move just the one square behind this wall can i move behind-- i mean i know that's not very far from him i will heal myself a little more i'm going to cure wounds on myself oh that's true i'm going to healing word as a bonus action i'll just do a level one that's not that much actually okay i'll just do that that'll end my turn sam's not here but his spirit is 22 there you go i'll take it nine 23 no i think i have the d8 for the mace 17 points of damage okay i'll cast shield of faith on myself i can move ten feet oh i haven't even moved yet i'm going to go back behind the wall yeah tuck into there is that the only damage you've taken this game are we allowed to loot the body okay 12 or wait hold on 13 aw sorry percy (sighs) sucks i don't know if i like this you're my friends oh hi vax oh boy now i can see him shit okay that changes what i was going to do i am going to cast flame strike at him all the fire all the rage oh no 21 no that's the full yeah i had some bad rolls okay so i just used a 5th-level to deal ten points of damage and i'm going to do healing word on myself at 2nd-level i'm going to stand directly behind the pole oh shit but then she can see me can i stay where i was yeah i'm just going to stay there 19 shit what in the heck eight ooh that's a natural one okay that changes what i was going to do i will stand up i am not going to move i am going to create a magic circle around myself and i am going to never mind oh it is one minute sorry that's why i made a last-minute decision okay you know what i'm just going to stay there and i'm going to cast spirit guardians yeah around myself third sorry fourth level i can't do anything else right i'm going to do shield of faith again okay okay okay i'll do a healing word again pfft no not at all 12 is it also the guardian of faith or no do i make a perception check is this included in the turn or will this take away something that i was going to do or is this just a perception check i would have to roll a 20 okay you know what i'm going to since i saw that the spirit guardian went off-- i would like to insect plague get rid of spirit guardians i want to put it around that area if he's not in there this is going to blow how many did i roll 13 yes i'd like to move-- can i move in between between the walls yeah i'll move in there not that that's that far away from him but maybe he didn't see because bugs are biting him do i have a bonus action i'm going to-- can i cast shield of faith on myself again never mind is that continuous a dex saving throw wow three this is so stressful yeah you're fine is he going stealth god dangit what is faerie fire six 7d10 shit okay phew okay i have to beat a 24 there's no way yeah there's no way okay okay okay i'm going to cast cure wounds on myself four i have one more well i have two after this one i'll have one more okay because i have four because of the ring keyleth's ring yeah yeah yes i don't think that's what it is now i'll move does that last for a long time or is that a one-time deal the flame storm okay so i'm going to tuck back behind that wall just back towards my guardian of faith not visible though in between ooh and so now i see him is he invisible no 19 damn it how are we health-wise everybody okay i did move 16 okay so i'm going to cast cure wounds on myself again at 2nd-level okay so 15 and then shield of faith as a bonus action and i'm going to stay for now i didn't move where the fuck are you i mean we can't-- if you find him you die this is rough he's right behind me isn't he i'm going to hold my turn until someone attacks me if someone attacks me then i'm going to attack back come out of hiding motherfucker (whistles as if for a dog) 17 4d6 okay so 19 okay can i just get up and then go to the middle part of the walls okay can i just start swinging and see if i can hit him if he's in there i mean he's not in there but i mean 28 (sighs) yeah yeah do it (whispering) sorry i did not know it was-- i was like oh yeah it'll probably be pretty quick okay i'm going to cast death ward on myself my last fourth okay so ugh so frustrating because i can't see him can i make a spiritual weapon to see stealthy people like stealth goggles i know i was just trying okay yeah i'm going to put a spiritual weapon just hovering that sweet sword of sarenrae second just right above me how's it feel all right i'm going to move forward to the front of this little tunnel here and i'm going to stay in there and then i'm going to move my spiritual weapon so it stays with me or does it stay with me and each square is five okay i'll just keep it with me down to the ladies i'm going to peek out so how far can i move so how far can i move around right here and is there lava over here okay i'm going to move right here yeah i'll do that i am going to cast harm on keyleth hey no man this is a good match-up though because-- oh that changed that one oh well (counting) 44 yikes okay and then i'm going to cast-- no that's all i can do right because i did the bonus action to move the spiritual weapon oh gosh she's going to kill me she's going to kill me natural 20 nice i think i'm done i'm done for i'm done for oh shit yeah it gets me 45 oh shit i'm at four i have death ward not that that's probably even going to do anything (shouting) fuck okay so hmm okay can i take my spiritual weapons and cut off the vines oh boy oh boy oh boy so i need to get out yeah i'm going to get out where is the lava now okay so i'll just crawl out towards her i'm done i'm done i can't do anything do i still have a spell in addition to doing something else okay 19 okay so shit i've got to play this correctly you're 51 okay so i do have a 3rd-level can i throw her ass into the lava okay i'm going to try and shove her with my-- no i'm going to command her to jump into the pool of lava yeah how do i word this what's the word jump ah fuck okay so i'll just shove her back into the lava that's behind her i mean what can i do at this point yeah i don't know how to do that or i can use my frostbrand okay strength and athletics okay so 16 yeah there's nothing else i can do right and i can't use a 7th-level correct if it's a bonus action it's a bonus action divine word i can all right i'm going to walk over to her because she's down right i'm going to just touch her hair and i'm going to say (tender voice) i'm sorry but i need to kill you and smoosh her face into the lava (laughter) hi sorry the monstah oh down to the nitty-gritties i didn't realize it was a bonus action until you were like you have a bonus action and i looked down and i was like okay well oh shit with death ward would that have done anything or no okay so i would have still had that one hit point travis just texted me and said i am so proud my buddy wow i was not expecting that you would have saved gosh that was down to the end i would have been done-zo good job because you can heal yourself yeah i was like i'll just build up and then-- yeah that would be the longest fight ever shit i always forget that i have advantages on charisma saving throws advantage on all intelligence wisdom and charisma saving throws oh shit so i probably would have rolled a little higher on some of these
