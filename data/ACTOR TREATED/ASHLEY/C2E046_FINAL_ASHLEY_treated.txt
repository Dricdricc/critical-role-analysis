it did you see that thing you didn't see any creature or anything i was fighting something it was a creature it was winged and it had red eyes it looked like it was a ball of lightning i don't know i was standing in front of the ship and i had a vision of home then i woke up and then the lightning struck when it came down it was the creature i guess if you didn't even see it i grabbed something out of it i guess it was its heart now it's gone okay well maybe i need to think on this a little bit more yeah i'm okay i'm going to go talk to caduceus hey caduceus hey yes sorry burning hair is not a good smell well i was-- oh that would've been nice okay i was at the bow of the boat and i was trying to connect with the stormlord i don't know i ended up getting a vision i think i did i'm pretty fried i fought something though it was lightning that came down and then turned into a creature yes it's here i think i need to keep trying to find him i guess he's found me that's what i was going to ask you i'm going to go back upstairs i go back upstairs i go back upstairs mm-hmm i just want to sit outside still i guess so i'm just trying to make sense of all this still i feel like-- i had some visions of home that made me very happy and sad at the same time but it must all mean something um yeah i had to leave i did something that i did something that wasn't the right thing to do according to my tribe in my tribe we have a matriarch of the tribe the champion and her name is the skyspear and when you become a part of the tribe you take a blood oath and you get a name and i was given the name orphan maker when you become a part of the tribe as time goes on you are given a mate but i fell in love with someone else that was not chosen for me and we got married privately i did but they found out and the punishment for that is death and they killed her and i ran away so i i am a coward i guess thank you jester in our tribe when you get married it's for life even if she's gone she'll always be mine her name was zuala yeah i left and i'm sure they were coming after me and i got into the wastes of xhorhas and something happened there's time that i cannot account for i was out there for months by myself and it seems like i woke up months later and i looked different and i felt different i woke up at an altar of the stormlord and he saved me for what yet i don't know but hopefully i can be a better champion for him and fulfill whatever purpose he has for me i don't know if my heart could ever be healed but i'm okay with that i feel like if it were put back together then that means zuala would be gone i know one day i want to go back there i don't know where she was buried but i have so many flowers to bring to her i don't know what all this means but i sometimes i don't know i don't know (background music) i feel like sometimes i get nervous to get close to people because i feel like i lose them and then molly i feel like i'm either very unlucky or cursed and i don't believe in luck that's true yeah i think so i think so this is very good tea what's in here like it's people i'm fine with it well maybe this is best kept to us i mean i'm fine with saying it but it's a long story and of course i think so i feel like i'm trying to learn that from you jester yeah you say what's on your mind-- it's good i'm going to try to start doing that to surviving to minty families balleater the boat is called the balleater sam and the balleater i've eaten some balls oh that's true that's true right in the middle of these three islands cool a furry octopus come on frumpkin wait they're already dead they're animated dead i love swimming i like scrapping so this is a combo of the two of them you know i'm in 14 that's a good idea yeah that first one was good 17 who is this i have to be close say again i am going to move as much as i can getting closer to them yeah i'm going to hold my action until one of them either-- yeah they get close to me wait they were 80 feet away oh from where i had gotten to with the 20 feet got it i'm going to move my 20 feet and get into range i'll get to it on the other side i'll get to whichever's closest they're on the other side right of the group yeah i'll get one whoever's closest to me unless i reckless let's do that i'm reckless yeah that'll hit 23 i'm raging sorry all right 20 okay second attack i'll hit it again ugh reckless got it that was a natural one okay okay okay (laughter) hits doesn't hit so one hits i'm fine oh why-- how many feet down did you say from the top can i try and giving a look-see too because i have darkvision oh you already have it what would the roll be is it perception 16 they do know we're here yeah this is so fun oh gosh hey what a great 2018 it was the best
