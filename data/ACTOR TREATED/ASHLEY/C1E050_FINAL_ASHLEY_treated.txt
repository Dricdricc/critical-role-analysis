you like to be young again yes we need to get you into better order okay all right where we at here i'm going to heal her up no no it's my job or some chicken yeah are you hungry so short rest means-- fuck grog i run over to him i grab the sword and i take it off of his-- away from him off of his person what do i-- roll the 20 11 okay i feel like it's the sword i mean we all know that sword has been weird yes i'll greater restoration on grog okay so short rest-- i have a 5th-level i have one 5th-level which is greater restoration aw shit i mean cure wounds no that's not going to do anything but wouldn't that be-- oh no i have heal i have one 6th-level wait wait i have revivify yes yes yes yes yes yes you touch a creature that has died-- i wasn't even looking at my 3rd-levels oh goodness okay okay can i do this first just to see if it works 14 just for extra yeah this is so stressful i want to go back you fell over dead it's not your sword anymore yeah i walk over and i stop grog we brought you back it was a group effort because she gave you a little to bring you back well i could try to-- no you're not going to touch it again percy what did you get from it what were you going to say vax that's true i could try casting greater restoration on the sword grog i mean it stabbed me so yeah i'm uncomfortable it's okay it's not your fault we'll find you a better weapon i don't want you to die from something that's not worth it we'll find you something strong what would happen if you threw it into the sphere it would get yeah that would be bad you don't think it would work if i tried greater restoration i do i have one more 5th-level i do okay hold on a minute first grog is at one hit point okay so i'm going to use my 6th-level and i'm going to use heal i don't know because i remember it worked one time on-- didn't we try that on his-- and then he could keep the sword should we try it let's try it bring it a d10 that was beautiful scanlan okay 17 okay 26 no wait yeah 26

muscle i take them off and i give them back are we doing a trade ooh does it maybe make me quiet as well i could be a pike kite grog that would kill me all right i'll take boots of levitation and you get these so you're super strong again hey i felt real cool punching that chicken that one time (laughter) what did you say that's true that's most important hey thanks anytime that's a scroll all i just saw was dark aura in really dark letters chicken and waffles perhaps oh just eggs okay i don't know it's like a mishmash of dough the side-- such a twinsies disadvantage okay can i put on my boots of levitation sam liam and i rolled a six pike is back what would it be without some clanging i don't think i did though (laughter) 19 mr vina mr drez vina (coughs) it just makes me so nervous

see that again i like this idea i'm going to use oh no because that won't be enough time plus ten 24 we're quiet 23 i could cast speak with dead and we could ask him some questions we could ask him up to five questions can we give him a proper burial we're going to put him back up that's what you sorry i don't answer no i'm just kidding hi scanlan oh yes slippers and everything yes it's great thank you so much pt yes it smells so good in here thank you oh thank you scanlan what is this do not open and in parentheses (until i'm dead) well hopefully i never have to open this bye scanlan i close
