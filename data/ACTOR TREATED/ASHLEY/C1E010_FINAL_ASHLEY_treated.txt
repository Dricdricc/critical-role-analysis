well what i saw was like a-- it's what i do when i'm thinking i had a little snack pouch i saw a single twisted unnatural black horn of-- would that work good resource pike grew up in the outskirts of town near the bramblewood her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation thievery destruction and trickery left them with the curse of the last name trickfoot sarenrae the goddess of healing and redemption had other plans for pike's great-great-grandfather wilhand who left his family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed the course of the trickfoot family wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal whether it was animals people or even flowers she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken she studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic she lived a peaceful life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead abandoned by his herd wilhand went to pike for help she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could bringing him back to life when he awoke she discovered his name was grog strongjaw after that they were best of friends a rather unlikely pair little did she know that in a few years' time grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death after being killed in battle pike felt angry she wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again she spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the broken howl gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other this time pike is ready i can assist because i have that as well no (all laugh) that's a really good point it's on the cover of a book burn the beams excellent i have something called divine intervention you can call on your deity and you roll a percentile die and you can have them help you with something i don't know because this is new yeah let's wait until we know what we're doing can you take the normal acid and could we make it magical we should just rest we'll stay up because we're good can we all fit on the magic carpet laura and i can water-walk i don't want to be split up are we getting on the boat or doing the carpet you guys are going on the carpet i bought a hoodie hey guys you guys what the heck birthday huzzah the same height as abraham lincoln which i'm still a fan of ooh i don't think i am yet because i missed a lot of games i'm chaotic good wait chaotic good does that make sense is that what i am what is my alignment it says chaotic good wait but maybe the crack would get healed because of my honesty roll i've got a wicked streak man (groans) fuck you dylan (all laugh) i'm going to re-watch that the rest is history 40-something years now on and off it's a long time you lose track-- i don't know we'll see trinket trinket why do i have food in my hair anyway who would you guys like to see play d&d with us i don't know if we can get barack obama you guys that would be great sasha gray sasha gray is a peter dinklage is on my hall pass list yeah yeah it's possible that will happen this time around when we fight k'varn hey there is an emote laura oh trinket best and worst d&d memories i can only read that because it's in all caps oh and you went through-- that's one of my favorite moments it was one of the funniest moments that we had i was crying i was laughing so hard oh man that's a really hard choice mr rogers for sure i love mr rogers i had already taken some hits and then i realized at a certain point because in the pathfinder edition if you're negative-- your constitution and then i wasn't keeping track and i looked down and it was way past my constitution and i was like oh matt so what does it mean if you're this the look that he gave me he was like oh and he just paused because he was like oh that you're dead (all laugh) and i instantly started crying i was like no no no no it was horrible i did i was like i'll stay in case anybody gets hurt i would pick grog or scanlan but also rogues the damage that you can do is so crazy another really special thing that we've done is that during christmas time-- we always have specials or winter's fest and we always give each other presents from our characters and it's probably my favorite thing ever it's so amazing the first christmas grog gave me two pine cone earrings i currently want to burn my dice because i've been rolling like a-- i know you have only cold random chance of what just on principle i can't buy new dice because i'm like it's not the dice minxie marisha and hogwarts houses that is awesome oh liam yeah man that was so great our warm comfy beds that we haven't gotten to sleep in yet probably stark billy mays here with another fantastic creation i just don't know because pike's heart might belong to somebody else it's my backstory as a character that's just personal it's my secret that i deal with whether people know it or not it's something i'm still working out i haven't talked to matt about it but that doesn't mean i couldn't possibly love scanlan there might be a chance (laughs) what is that that would suck risk settlers of catan and that's what saved my life that's awesome i pictured him with black hair too it's funny because when we first started and for the two years that we've been doing it there was an element that i liked about it that it was just ours and then when i would try to tell people i was like ugh they're not going to understand we get to go and play make-believe and nobody is judging anybody and we can just go do it so i was hesitant when we were starting the show but what's been awesome is that you guys have been so accepting and such an amazing group in the chat room and how you guys have been supportive of us this has been one of my favorite things that i've been a part of in my life that's a really bold statement i love it so much after two years obviously there's so much more of an attachment to it but i just love it i love it so much hey man our group text message thread is insane the fan art that you guys have been putting out is so amazing it's a swedish dwarf oh critters i love you yeah yeah but i feel that also the dm makes all the difference in the world find a good dm which there isn't anyone as good as matt
