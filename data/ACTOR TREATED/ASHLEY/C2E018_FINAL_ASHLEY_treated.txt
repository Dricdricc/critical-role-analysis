you're fighting just if you're fighting-- i just wanted to know if you were fighting the kryn i wish you the best of luck okay where did he say we could meet up rexxentrum i figured it's like one of those things that if you're going to get caught you might as well tell the truth because it's easier to remember i don't know i panicked i don't think so did i say anything that was bad oh i said both of those things either that or they think that i'm a xhorhasian assassin and i am not it's the kryn dynasty no well i don't know if that is any of your business at this time i'm not on any side but i do think what we are fighting is something very terrible yeah yeah yeah i mean we heard about them in the north and they're mostly dark elves that settled in a massive ruin that was completely forbidden for us to travel to yeah the ones that went there they do keep their skies dark it's some kind of dark magic that we don't know of that keeps the sun away they've enslaved men and beasts and demons under their banner i've never been there because it's hard to get there and it's not someplace i would want to go alone i've heard stories but never anybody personally i've always been curious just to see with my own eyes but they've done so many bad things that i would want to fight them i don't know you charge for these services oh i don't agree i feel like you would be very good at it

a four may i take a look at that map jester that's a good idea that was crazy i wonder if there's any way to find out somehow what it is before accepting yeah what what do you mean you get control of your fate can you go back and-- do you want to try it i'm going in okay do you feel like you have control over your fate yeah we should explore this idea but maybe oh what does it do no we'll come
