that where that thing is well i just-- i don't know if i should be talking about this in front of him earmuffs (all laugh) in this vision that i had i was pulled down toward the mines into the tunnels below where the dwarves were working well past the goblinoid creatures and past a great underground lake past a jagged onyx colored fortress framed in molten rock past a field of broken glass and bone have you seen any of this taliesin and i wonder if there's like-- what if i mean-- do you guys wanna like put me down on a rope and i can just run around see if there's any openings i mean i have a lot of armor well no just like halfway and then i can run around and look for tunnels well some of us can fly so we're okay maybe there's hidden stairs or something like in indiana jones is it like a many-armed situation (all laugh) okay swell not if we wear our-- i mean i have-- i can cast it onto my shield and then on the carpet and we would have a double-- one nothing to add well i'm new to armor you know fuck definitely not me she's on the carpet you won't die today oh no 23 good thing we didn't cast the light roof roof roof this is fucking stressful let's land on the roof we're lighting up now we're still not safe stealthy 21 let's go in through the roof what is that smile (shushes) night-night stay invisible fuck should we go in daylight on my shield how nine not to brag i jump on to grog's foot (all laugh) oh i wouldn't have had to do it all right well i'm in the building six i'm okay i'm okay get skinny get skinny bye bye 17 okay well i'm still prone okay i use my movement to get back up do i also get an attack for doing that okay i will use guiding bolt and i'm gonna shoot that thing okay do i add anything sorry guys oh sweet okay so that would be 25 so i roll where'd it go i roll 4d6 i roll 4d6 yes 16 wait what are you at can i give him a healing potion can i heal him okay i'll use healing word what 57 good turn one down one down sweet licks on your flute (all laugh) wait does he get do we get-- was i close enough to him to get an attack yeah (imitates horn) okay so time for a cure wounds so i guess let's see i'll go yeah i'll go can i just go he's over there okay how close can i get to him i can't see the lines in the squares oh i have sprinter's boots i have sprinter's boots okay so i'm gonna use my sprinter's boots i can-- while you wear these boots you can use a bonus action and click the boots' heels together if you do the boots double your walking speed for one minute so then i'm so sorry i can't see the squares so if i can get ten to get over there wait wait hold on can i cast guided strike which adds ten to-- hey get away from him man so that's mass cure wounds so does that heal-- i'll just do cure wounds i'm gonna use it at the highest-- i'll use it at fifth level yeah i'll do it at my highest level that i can cast which is-- sorry guys i'm just warming up again (all laugh) -- which i think is eight my spell attack bonus plus eight so 5d8 + 5 18 plus five yeah 23 23 wait what i can't do anything else right what are you at everybody knows shit's fucked kill him kill him kill him oh you killed him rip him apart good plan 25 bye hello bye wait is that a little icon of you what you're an emoji you've made it laura and sam did leave laura had to go to a thing and sam had to go to a thing hey look at-- (all laugh) yeah he's pretty good chaotic good was my first yeah yup oh well i'm on the fence about him he's really pretty great but i don't know i'm not really sold yet i know we never girl talked about it i know we should talk i just i really like him i think he's really funny i really the fact that he's a musician but i don't know i'm not really sold on him yet oh no you know what he likes to frequent brothels and things like that which you know i'd wanna give him his freedom and his space i don't know if i'm into it another couple people on there were asking about my ears and i really like supporting small businesses and there's a store on etsy called tiny tangerines and she makes these by hand and makes like deer and bears she makes a ton of stuff check her out it was sad i was definitely crying i was like no i love doing this so much i don't wanna i mean when you spend that much time with people over two and a half years you get so attached and attached to characters no way super hot i really noticed-- i want a grog shirt that says do it yeah there's no way you just thought that up i didn't know that i knew-- i came in late to the game and there were only a couple options left and i had never played so i picked gnome because i was like oh that's funny and then cleric i didn't really realize what a cleric was and how detailed it can be if you've never played and important to the game so when i started i was like well shit this is a little tougher than i thought it would be but it's been awesome i love being a cleric me too man me too oh also someone asked who is pike's deity and it's sarenrae the goddess of healing and redemption among other things it's the best troll penis (all laugh) there you go someone asked if grog could keep one of his women in the bag of holding you can't put living things in the bag of holding that would suck so much i was in tears i think also having-- because with magic and everything like that just bringing somebody back to life so easily since we don't have that as much as maybe other games-- it's heightened so every time someone gets hurt we're all i think now after having that death all of us are like where are you at where are you at we're all so stressed out now which is it's kinda cool that would be amazing can we ship grog and vex troy baker is pike's distanced dad (all laugh) wait what are you sharing that'd be a long game a helicopter a helicopter shot probably portal portal or dragon age borderlands 2 ooh it's tough man chocolatesweets a bunch of times has asked would you guys consider cosplay for the games i think it would be kinda hard for me to play the game in cosplay 'cause i have probably the most armor now i would probably switch with liam or travis it's gonna be bad burt reynolds would be a dream guest i've only had one kill and it was a dragon but the thing that i probably the whole battle with the family that was sort of possessed when i actually died that was probably one of my favorite battles maybe not after i died prior to when i got to finish off the dragon-- the dragon yes that night was so amazing because we had we made it a winter festival so we all came in our pajamas it was close to christmas that's why it was a winter festival it was like our little christmas party i was super into it still love the shits the brotherhood of the sisterhood of the order or something like that probably yeah yes that's what i was trying to say what are you sure i still don't think that was a bad idea i feel like it was a good decision that was hilarious oh come on i don't know man this is true it's the og i don't know what that even-- please let's leave it alone moving on what is this what do we have over here well who was the old gnome that grog saved in his intro video no that was my great great grandfather yes great great grandfather wilhand that's right i was gonna say lord of the rings maybe rivendell i saw it me ashley saw it but pike did not hear about it yet who knows that could be the thing that seals the deal i'll be like you killed the naga okay let's do this (all laugh) i actually did step i kind of did hurt liam one game or vax there were some of the girls changing in a room vax was very curious to see what a gnome looked like naked so he rolled stealth and he did and saw or whatever and then when i came back out and i found out about it it was just a small human and i think i stepped on your foot and gave you some damage yeah a hit point or two i earned it i don't know how you do this new one i think i might have an idea well taking those mushrooms someone wants to hear gilmore's voice gilmore's awesome totally so that means we haven't used 'em yet my favorite npc character is a little butler who i think became-- he's the cutest little thing you will ever see and i think now he works at-- what's his name he's just the sweetest little thing you ever did see bad news bears my dad was from sweden never been hair obviously probably the-- favorite tabletop games not d&d i'm just starting that's badass i know me too thanks danielle ty timothy cool name kathel luis when is honesty hour wait is this noncompliant that's amazing yay
