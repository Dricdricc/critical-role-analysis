oh boy well i knew that after i guess when we found out that when we were going to start streaming the show and after pike had died in our home games i had talked to everybody about wanting to have pike be a little bit stronger and get a little bit more strength so when she was in battle she could fight and offer a little bit more to the fight than just healing which is still important so i think-- this is a roundabout answer but i think i wanted her to spend some time at sea and on the broken howl and on a boat just basically doing simple boat work getting her strength that's pretty much it honestly it was one of those things where when we knew we were going to be on the stream i was like okay this was what i wanted to have done on my time off and because of my background on boats i was like let's make her a little bit of a sailor but honestly i don't think she had a very exciting life on the boat other than getting pretty swole was the scar from that time i thought i'd already had it no i forgot that was your dad's name (laughter) hey (high-pitched) um (laughter) i would like to think that that's the reason why but i believe it's because i live across the country so i know matt found a way around that which i'm so thankful that he did and here i am still an astral projection a high-def astral project uh (laughter) yeah getting that was huge i mean i don't know how many times that i went unconscious in battle after that but-- a lot and you know getting that vestige was such a huge part of pike feeling important in battle getting the courage to go out and be in the middle and knowing that it would be okay if she got knocked out a couple times and she'd be fine yes books are magic but both are true sorry i initially was trying to figure out what question you were asking brian sorry oh i did i'm just not acknowledging it (laughter) what's in the box that is the one question that i had this whole entire evening yeah it still drives me crazy and when we were coming back for the last part of the wrap-up and when we all met up and were like okay this is what we did in our time off for the last games i was going to go look for the box and i forgot to tell you that when we were all in to figure out what we were doing we started the game and i was like shit i still don't believe you nope (laughter) i feel like i got into that as we played some games with scanlan again i think grog and pike were so hurt i think me as a player was-- hi i think me as a player i was bummed because i was gone so much and then he left while i was gone and then there was this new guy i mean taryon was great but come on i want to play with scanlan i know i said a lot of the things in one of the later games after he came back once pike got the courage i don't know that's one of those things that you never know that maybe-- i don't think pike would have been able to stop him he was going to go no matter what that would have been very fun that goes back to all of us giving matt a little kernel of something and him taking it with his amazing storytelling i just knew that my family was going to be tricksters and thieves and that whole thing hence the last name i didn't know any of that was going to happen obviously but i would have gone with it if it would have happened that would have been fun to see an evil pike we were very scooby-dooed guiding bolt up the butt me too yeah i think it-- well i don't think i know a lot of it started in the letter even in our home games i think the two of us would flirt a little bit sorry babe she didn't take it very seriously because she didn't think that he was very serious about it as you guys heard that letter is very intense when he left she realized how much she cared for him and missed him when he came back he was different and a little bit more mature and she thought the time had passed that is not so it was this slow climb after the letter well for a very long time it was percy i think that-- i think she saw through her faith and the light that she carried within her that he was a marked man she could see the weight on his shoulders and the darkness that he carried with him she did so much thinking and praying for his soul i think all of that time spent on him was confusing to her obviously it never would've worked but in the end it was always scanlan i think there was some time there where she was a little taken by the dark side it's all just a little bit more personal i think it goes back to my first game that changed my life
