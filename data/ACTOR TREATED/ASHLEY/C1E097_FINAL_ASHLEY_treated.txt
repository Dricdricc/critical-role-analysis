how der der der der what oh my god it's only 715 okay go get her stop laughing travis stop it oh my god it's okay just know i don't want you to-- if you don't want to stay here you don't have to stay here i'm not holding you here against your will in any way but i would love for you to stay because i would love to get to know you better okay what happened do we need to fix anything yes cure wounds you just dove off free willy-nilly i forgot that that's what that was i felt a (whirring) you know i'm going to heal her up a little more a what yeah i'll do a cure wounds i haven't used any spells let's do 5th level where are you at now i say we go back i would love to go back and maybe have lots of drinks good call and jb if there is anything you need out of there okay no oh that's a great idea i feel like she would be great at it would you even be interested in maybe running a bakery or is that something that just sounds like the most dreadful thing in the world do you bake this is a beautiful cream puff no (laughter) this is delicious this is better than anything that we make have you tried any of our baked goods yet can i insight check her because i don't trust anybody 27 i get a whisper i don't think on the show i've had a whisper well i think that she should die i'm just kidding (laughter) do you have references how long has your husband been missing about six months no i'm not jb don't feel pressured if you don't want to do this she's a fantastic baker yeah that seems like a little more fun hilda (whispering) but grog you can read some of those books a little bit well okay i think this is a great idea no but i think she should plan for her life if he's not coming back yeah the stupid box that we buried still haunts me to this day i would love to come she's a loner why is there no furniture in her apartment mountain flowers are there children's books in here (whispers) where are they can i see if i can find a kid's book 13 orchid sometimes when those letters are together it sounds like a k is there a place-- just ask percy privately she can stay with me do i have an extra bedroom or how does this work maybe there's a murphy bed or something extra in the room jb do you-- i don't know how-- you are more than welcome to stay with me i do have night terrors so sometimes not fun but you can stay with me or you could have your own room okay wait which one just wait it out nah okay this will be fun it'll be like sleepovers maybe we can make a fort just all the blankets tapestries i have a feeling you are a great fort builder percy thank you yes please it's critical role's dice t-shirts backblaze i want to know it was so much i took jb back and we built a fort in the room is he at the bakery i'll check the bakery (whispers) yeah is hilda there i don't see anything here hilda's not here the bakery looks normal what if he's still here i've made my way upstairs well hilda never showed up for her interview (laughter) doty doty do you know where taryon went i feel like-- could you give him the book could you draw something for me again do you know where taryon went can you draw it shit i thought he listened to me he does listen to me oh that's right doty you're new you're new doty doty don't do that doty don't play that do you bake cream puffs thank the chat they know i like that idea that smoke plume knows where it's going is it possible she could've put some kind of covering over them yeah dangly bits should we mist that way i like that idea it's a critical stealth i'll stand in the middle of the road maybe i can act like i'm an old woman trying to cross the road i'm going to pull up my cloak and slowly start crossing excuse me ma'am no what's your name you should still make your dad pay though you could say i would've come here-- and if you show up with all of us and her say you could've just called i would've shown up but you still have to pay her well i don't know i don't know him you know she was able to find you maybe she could also find somebody else for us a very good friend well hold on tary if you had it your way what would you want majority rules but let's hear what you have to say that's fair did i overhear them 16 okay she doesn't have to bring him or anything it could be just looking bring us information if she sees him we don't have to we don't have to do it but i do like the idea of this woman-- this woman had a job to do it's not her fault i'm sorry tary but i do feel like we need to let her complete her mission i know i know but i feel like he should've come back already what if he's dead if that's the case then maybe she can tell us that and then we'll leave it alone but what if he's dead yes i like that idea see she thinks-- i like that idea she owes us a favor at some point maybe we should table it is there any other way than marriage that you can think of you can't marry her no you don't two points do you know lydia here's the thing you're not going to marry her okay because if he wants to be a better father to you then he's going to let this go and not let you do this if that means him being out on the street that's my opinion sometimes when you let that go only then are you able to truly live i don't even have any money money gives you everything you want i say we go talk to the many no we all have such terrible families
