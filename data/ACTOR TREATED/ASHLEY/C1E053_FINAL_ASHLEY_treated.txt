could go see if my great-great grandfather is okay yeah who-- how-- where is-- yes it's close yes can i check the door if it's locked that's a good thing he's fine just nothing even happened you can try 20 i go over to theodore and-- i don't think i have to bend down i had a little wooden doll and so i'm going to pass it to him and say in case we never see you again you can always think of us when you play with this that's for you and you can name him whatever you want pike theodore follow me please that's a good sign i think that's a good sign yeah pop-pop wilhand it's pike a little he could-- a little vax would you mind maybe you'll get some luck with this door wait hold on i forgot that somewhere in this armor-- all that clanking is actually this key moving about my armor all right i go to the crack pop-pop wilhand it's pike he's very strong okay i step in and start looking around can i check the bedroom there are hiding places okay i go running down i just pull them off pop-pop wilhand i give him a big hug i missed you so much i'm so glad you're okay long story we'll get there yeah there was a very big battle and grog beat kevdak chopped him in half straight down the middle filleted him so everything's a little bit more under control hopefully mm ish hey guess what though we've fought many dragons already and guess what i killed one two or three it's okay right now all right i drink the whole rest of the bottle it's a little stronger than i remember it oh no would you all-- there's plenty more would you all like to join me and have a sip i think we should make a meal he's a very good cook he does he does have a mansion it's a magic mansion at dawn we plan we'll fix it davin was my neighbor he's my great-grandfather so we can put him in the mansion all right i kiss him on his forehead and say it's going to be okay go in there take a nap and show them how to cook (whispers) what we'll talk about it later what oh i've been there you can go stay-- i have my own room you can go stay in my room hey scanlan how will he know which room is my room it's very big roll for initiative i would like to go check my room out and see how it is see if it's okay any damage right i wanted to grab something under the bed i'm going to take it and i'm going to hide it but if everybody is out of the town and it's empty then won't the dragon know and then won't he leave how much time are you thinking i could throw up a blade barrier on top of him should we check it for traps first (fart noise) raaaah goosh yeah i have dispel magic yeah all right 18 i think it's dispelled thanks vax yeah it's really pretty but lemme give it a try let's leave it it's so pretty i mean that key was hidden for a reason i might need some extra help because i only got a ten make him wave keyleth that's awesome pop-pop pop-pop could do it but i don't know if he would be very-- i couldn't possibly use my glove of storing could i to hold his hand all right you've attuned to them yup i want to train too sit-ups are we learning skills group workout i call him fluffy it's-- you're in slow-mo you sneaky-sneaky as you take it off your head-- these are cool you don't you don't even feel that wow did it say anything to you okay this is good this is good this is an improvement from your last weapon bad yeah where'd it go where'd it go it was right-- can i-- can i perception check it insight check it can i-- i'll learn that spell and i'll check it later i can't tell anything right now it looks pretty normal and it's a good sign that it's not talking to you yeah and they look really cool whoa whoa and you just did it with the hands can i swing the axe no at the dummy i'm going to try it i'm going to try swinging the axe at the dummy what's that my strength 19 i didn't i don't think i erased that i want to be a monstah (laughter) yeah at dawn we plan that's me i'm having trouble what are you thinking that was so sudden can i roll stealth and hide right now that was a segue if i've ever heard one i will definitely have to think about it because that's a lot-- you know what i will think on it and i will give you an answer after some dragons are killed and-- let me think on it scanlan let me think on it i think i was really start-- yeah it's okay it's okay maybe you just feel that way because we could all die so you feel like you maybe-- i don't know we'll table it okay where is wilhand he's probably made a delicious meal it's all-- if he had more stuff he could really do well i go get a blanket and cover him oh buddy as we're walking to sleep i grab scanlan real quick i grabbed scanlan real quick once everybody's-- so i have to tell you something it's not an answer for that it's just that-- it's fine it's okay i have to confess something to you when you gave me that letter-- when you told me not to read it until you died-- i read it immediately after you left because curiosity gets the best of me sometimes i can't-- it's not-- i know but that-- what does that even mean i go back and forth with it i know but what-- i know it was very personal and i just wanted to tell you that everything you said in that letter i promise to you that i give you my word that everything you said in that letter i promise to you i will do if you die (laughter) i know and we've had so many close calls and i feel like i just needed to tell you so you had some comfort in your person in your body that you knew that if-- i know you do make me a little nervous and i'm not really sure why and i need to reconcile these feelings well i don't know i'm so confused maybe we should just sleep together and see what happens i'm just kidding i'm just kidding it was just a joke i know i'm being careless i think that drink that wilhand gave me is settling and it's-- moving about making me say things i'm just kidding i don't actually think we should sleep together i just need to tell you that i-- anyway scanlan i love you well you've grown those forearms for a reason so just go take care of business i did yes i am taking that vow okay and i was trying to be funny and i didn't mean to be careless with your feelings i do love you so much and a part of my heart does-- i do love somebody else very much but my feelings are growing for you a little bit in a weird way and i'm not sure what it is but we'll figure it out i'm confused but i never told you i did not read it which is-- what's your picture okay well i love you i give him a hug and a kiss on his cheek may i say something i realize you want to go and protect your people but even if you run you guys will eventually come across a dragon that will kill all of your people so what if we fight together because there's strength in numbers yeah but i have gnome cunning-- charisma-- so i have advantage on charismas i do gnome cunning-- advantage on all intelligence wisdom and charisma oh yes i didn't read the rest of it all right so persuasion little persuashe all right that's a 20 fuck nine hah he laughs we've already killed dragons i pull out my necklace with the tooth on it i spit at his feet as ivon starts going out i want to trip him stick my foot out it'll probably fail 12 sorry i'm so small you probably just didn't see me (laughter) dick at dawn we plan
