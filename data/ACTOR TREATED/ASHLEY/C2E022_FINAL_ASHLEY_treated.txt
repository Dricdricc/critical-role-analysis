someone has a conversation with me i will talk to them no i don't think it goes as bad as you think i mean yes sometimes i think it's been pretty bad even for me sometimes watching you but that doesn't mean-- there's always room for improvement-- i don't think i'm good at giving advice but just talk to people if they talk to you and be nice you know eat with your mouth closed wash your hands wash your hair when you can that's fine (dubious noise) i feel like you're still-- how do you stay dirty all the time so you don't want people to pay attention to you i get that i feel that way but i'm hard to miss i don't mean that in a woo i'm hard to miss yeah well i-- what i could shave you right now with my sword i've done it before i like to not have hair on my arms this is what i do i really think that cleanliness and hygiene is very important okay do you just want a trim is there a certain look you want do you want it all gone or you just want-- it's easier to do that i won't i'm going to hold it like this and then the blade-- this is how i do it i hold it and then i whoosh you know so sit here oh yeah lie down i've never done it like that but yeah lie down i have done this before not with this something a little smaller yes you don't have to hold your breath because it will take a very long time and you'll pass out you need to relax breathe in breathe out okay i got it here we go 16 no i was giving him a shave you know if anyone else-- none of you-- yeah i mean i've done it before what did you say i don't like that idea then what are we going to do with kiri

the thing go away okay okay okay oh shit oh i do that's not much better ten okay all right can i get out of the water okay i'll hop up back on that out of the water there okay so i'll move closer to where i think the guy is and then i will cast healing hands on myself bring me to a whole seven yeah maybe not a good idea to walk over there tasty treat 18 oh my god okay i’m going to hold-- i'm going to stay where i'm at i've got nothing to attack so i'm just going to hold my turn until i you know yeah in case something shows up in the water and then i can-- but for next time when you kill it and get a how do you want to do this with it just in case i'm going to go around to-- can i flank him behind or somewheres then you know attack it's not considered flanking that's fine okay disadvantage okay 18 i'm going to try nine 12 for the first hit okay 20 12 yeah i don't think i can't do anything else it hits i rolled a 16 and a 21 that's just a regular attack nine yeah see ya oh
