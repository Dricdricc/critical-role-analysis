a master this is a very powerful beast but it needs a firm hand and i think it needs a job so what do we plan to do with galdric said his name right i reach into the bag of holding and i pull out one thing of dry food rations and a probably pretty rotten chunk of dark elf brain oh there's a veritable walmart of shit in this bag (laughter) does it have a little bit of a viscous-y ooze mostly it'll soften up the dry food so i throw that on the ground and i pour a little ale on top of it (laughter) yeah no it wasn't the best i can do better okay he's going to barf that all over the carpet later i need to carry beef in this bitch oh that's really good to know i offer him some ale just to see if he even likes it some dogs like beer some others don't yeah all right then i chug it all right that's a great thing to throw at a giant 400-pound bull mastiff right so we're walking back to town we've got a giant fuck-off wolf with us vax looks like edward scissorhands what yeah do we find a holding pen for the wolf he'll mount you let's be clear (laughter) with the troll it was so good that was you wasn't it who was getting humped on keyleth repeat after me in exchange for food protect these lands i didn't say that shit i didn't say that he's a wolf he doesn't need those (quietly) holy shit no no a great danger approaches you'll know it when it comes i walk over and put my hand over keyleth's mouth you stay we feed you is there a tavern or a butcher shop or something nearby that was the dumbest thing i've ever heard (laughter) me a willing creature need not make a saving throw
