we play dungeons & dragons that's total news (triumphant yelling) burn it down wow true be careful with it don't rush it don't rush it it's too nice can we get copies of that after the show no not ready the laziest bail wow crash and burn i love it when you can hear the dm's frustration in the retelling of the story no yeah maybe we should just leave what do you think pack up and go mm i'm good y'know it was only a joke nott sorry terrible timing we should push on really lots of eyeballs sounds like a magic place this fucker who has the best darkvision i would imagine we should have-- i have 60 the two clerics do not go shoulder-to-shoulder well you got shitty darkvision oh but you got the goggles and who are you with nott darkvision for yasha-- 60 feet decent i don't know maybe outside of the tunnel back at the place where we were i will give you advantage helping yeah well as a bit of clarification i think we weren't supposed to use it right anything that would activate it and send off energy i think as long as it's in the other dimension that is her bag it's okay right you've got the gun and the clip the only way they're going to grab it and turn it out is if most of us are dead right that's right let's push forward probably and we've got lots of room to maneuver in these caverns you know dire honey badgers got claws and stuff maybe a dire sheep yeah anyway it'll hit you in the moment i got a feeling totally what are you rolling for we press on i forget what time we entered into the tunnel what time of day was it we could push on for another hour or two but we really should-- you fucking feat absolutely i'll help succinct we are going to rest right i mean might as well take advantage of such a nice place earthen backs against a wall are always safe five more wow this is 100% what we're supposed to be doing confirmation we're doing good do we want to take watches we're pretty safe right sam and let's all try it everybody's sleeping look how pretty that book is god sexy mm-hmm (dripping water noises) sorry was i throwing you natural 20 30 30 oh balls and anus here you go 22 no 24 oh a river pond yep big-ass body of water big enough to show up on a map biped signs of life well jester aren't temples better served by like heavy foot traffic you know-- we'll keep an eye on the entrance and exits i'll go to over where we think from beau's notes the creature seems to have gone mm-hmm nice 20-- 20 no 21 oh no 18 is pretty good considering i have no initiative bonus sam and no i don't know half-orcs i don't know i could have taken a feat that would've given me but-- what is this thing what is that sadistic japanese traffic cone oh fucking balls what is this (laughs) what the fuck is that is it 18 for fjord yasha got a 14 i do well i have a short moment of freak out as a rock formation grows fucking tentacles since the rest of the group doesn't seem to have noticed them i will charge up two eldritch blasts and send one in each direction point both of them out i will do it that is 16 to hit not good can i bonus action hex the second one before the other attack yeah that'll at least help a little bit 17 big trouble 17 didn't hit it i'll come up on top of that platform and take a little bit of cover behind that-- yeah just right there is good i don't know what the fuck they do or a tactician (nervous laughter) four no evidence to support that stop rolling so many dice maybe we get the fuck out of here that was a big hit three more how about they fought in the last week and one of them is missing one like sharks in the wild and they've got battle damage you know okay that's terrible yeah draw that what do you mean reel these attacks are real i don't know what these things are could you use your action if she hadn't already i'll use my 30 feet and i will come around that cover and i will run down to the-- that is a lot amazing i will run up and take two swings with the summer's dance falchion against the stunned that's amazing okay that is a 29 to hit the second one is not as great that is only a 19 misses yeah all right eight 12-- oh 1d6 for hex 15 points of slashing damage i am going to use my bonus action and use misty step on the falchion to bamf back up on the platform yep and that is my turn yasha would like to rage she will rush the traffic cone from hell that is attacking caduceus and caleb and take two strikes with her magician's judge reckless attacks please i love barbarians so much (counting) 13 times three is 39 right yeah 39 points of slashing damage oh times two sorry 26 not times three times two 26 that's it yeah oh no sorry rage is three 29 it does that hits so hitting it doesn't make them drop the grapple i was hoping that would be the case those circles are so great tentacles made of rock as well boom good call thank god he didn't take anybody with him that cobalt fighting style doo-bah yeah straight roll i'll run back up and take two swipes with the summer's dance falchion yeah me too first one is a 28 and the second one is a 29 just straight nice ten plus four is 14 points of slashing damage with four points of necrotic in there from the hex the second one is eight plus six 14 plus five points of necrotic for 19 points of damage like a hero i run up behind it and take inspiration from beau and i go (whoosh) doo-bah you're welcome yeah let's book wait who's-- yeah we'll heal on the way actually yasha will run up to caleb as we're running and she will do healing touch because she never does that shit to caleb and put-- what is it healing hands healing seven points she never wastes an action on that is that what they're called like octopus oh let's go back and check that water can i walk up and touch it and see if any of it moves or is different yeah i'll start doing that i'll do the same thing i'll throw some eldritch blast at it i'll move my hex over onto it 16 points of eldritch damage one of those hits 21 no sorry 21 to hit before he fires 19 points of damage four necrotic i don't know what that is but i don't think you should use it no more two more eldritch blasts ooh natural 20 natural 20 and a 20 13 points of eldritch blast on the first one and 13 points on the second one man that's so weird no scoot no no yasha's pulling rocks fjord's pulling rocks not fast enough nobody knows what that is are you in the tunnels yeah and there wasn't much of an ambush we could do anyway it's one way in one way out we'll be fine you know if you're going to do those maybe put some chimes behind them so you can be like a bell tower is s'me one word s apostrophe m-e okay she loves i'm roughly counting so i don't know nott i have to say i've been feeling pretty bad hearing that you drowned previously i want to apologize for making you face your fear over and over again no i've been giving you some shit and as someone who has experienced the same thing i commend you for your bravery yeah that's cool don't worry about it yeah no but thank you all the same oh fucking balls wow really now it's super dark lives could be at jeopardy at any moment and you want to trip yeah why do you do these things oh crap no constitution saving throw is there anything on the ceiling as i awkwardly stare up at it oh i was kidding but-- 17 yes like on the sides or-- up in front of us man i hate to interrupt but you know we have some divergent pathways ahead yeah hey you want to send that cat of yours about 50 feet behind us it looks like two of those had stuff pushed into it that one looks like something came out of it that one came into this one though after the big guy came through caduceus go look up front jesus god anything behind us why why a hammer what that we can be under the ashkeeper peaks and these are mining tunnels i think we're dead under this mountain-peak right (counting) we're like (taps) might as well see where this thing goes we can keep going if we have to there could be pigeons on the mountaintop is there another kind not helping do we have any real positives for going up i honestly can't think of any how far can frumpkin go how about just to that edge then get it off he can't hear us my two cents i think they did a pretty good job of closing up these tunnels right made it so that the average joe or even someone able-bodied would be unable to follow them i think this is probably the last place they think someone would come from above ground pretty sure they're covered they're small right they're small tunnels yeah i mean we're already dealing with the two-body-width tunnel as it is i don't want to shrink it down any lower and really be fucked send the cat i thought the cat went up the small tunnel yeah let's send him up the small one that's what i was thinking i'll run up and push myself up against the wall against where the tunnel is just in case they decide to come out that way do we hear any movement coming from the tunnel yasha rolled a six fjord rolled a 15 i reach down and grab the spear and yank it out of its hands what are you (yells) no no no oh shit oh shit what [break] rickymarooo bot username same page as you oh good this is my forte these days 11 fuck that's so embarrassing we should run we should go just run forward world of magic and mystery nice draconic deity upside down how about the food we have two gator skins in the bag of holding yeah are you interested in gator it's like real tough leather i mean bet you could use it as some-- i know yeah it's so rare i mean maybe it's better we just hold onto the gator i don't know i mean i could maybe part with one for the rest of us-- well all right i pull out two gator skins my friends will have to be able to go on their way i mean i hate to they're worth a fortune and boy the protection that they yield mmm dogie ah-- okay yeah wait a path the big one ask them if they've been all the way to the end of the-- have you been all the way to the end of big mess tunnel why not yeah we ran forward yeah what is in that cage are we going to pass judgment on this thing come on let's just keep going and turn a blind eye i know where you're going with this this is going to backfire yeah uh-huh i don't think that's accurate shit they're watching us leave they're escorting us out mm-hmm mm-hmm there you go is the dome out are we summoning the whole thing i'm sitting cross-legged on the floor staring at the dirt you son of a bitch you slow-playing son of a bitch that was good that was some bullshit not playing this fucking-- little scorpion on the end of the stick please hit yeah best place jester you killing them or what you don't want to play with that what'd he say sounded like there's something that shoots centipedes on me (panicked screaming) (screaming) that was fucking terrible oh notravis  (groans) marisha marisha as fun as that was you know instead of killing this adorable little guy maybe we could enlist him as a scout or guide stop no hey hey i think you'll have no trouble finding your way back how far down this tunnel have you ventured before spurt oh shit brave new world oh god this is it the swan song oh my god we should keep going (laughing) it's dark down here not good not good yes please have some real armor remember that number kids 28 points of bludgeoning damage i run to the side of the cavern wall and lean up against it and shrink down shh shh holy fuck 23 natural 20 19 and yasha rolled an 11 is that the quickest we've ever had a player character come in and die yeah we're pressed flush thank you two natural 20s caleb you ever read about anything like this yeah crazy dark-- oh you have no dark citadels i mean this is an accident right this isn't where we're trying to go yeah we'll get back to that how far from the opening of the tunnel that we're at off to the left are both of the fire giants natural 20 got to love those critical role dice you chaotic motherfucker how much shit can i throw on one person what is this where the fuck are we i think diplomacy will be our best tactic let's use words yeah it worked well before and the other fire giant-- the second fire giant is on this side of the molten river of death uh-huh one that's a fire giant i thought that was the citadel those are shields this the worst american gladiators course ever (laughter) fire shield magma shield what happens after they attack us in the bubble yeah i don't know about the bubble thing what if it breaks what about when it expires non-fighting options i can take one person with me 90 feet in a single direction i could create a false diversion that's a massive beast in the opposite direction of us or i could make a real beast oh they both are i have a suggestion i can make a manticore appear run from the cave and leap/fly over the river and carry off in the direction that is opposite of where we need to go it sounds and looks like a real manticore but if you make contact with it it's just an illusion so you can go invisible you can go the entire distance you're fast as balls caleb's fast as balls i can take one person with me with one person who's the odd man out who doesn't have a way to get over there real quick how long is your speed nott how do you feel about--- sure okay caleb do you have a plan to get across i'm asking i'm taking caleb you're running balls you're invisible 90 feet it would be pretty close we're going to send both of them in the opposite direction yeah we don't do any of this until they fucking move away from where we need to go ready sure sounds good i like it here's the order you're going to polymorph caduceus you're going to go invisible and get started i'm going to set the diversion and then we start going i don't think so you are doing that laura and i turn to yasha and say when i give you the signal you and i are going to run towards the river of magma and hold on tight but nugget's like in your pocket right three two one get your head start both of you you're not just going to fly across the room by yourself beau and nott i'm going to give you 15 seconds before we start it's your call are you going to trip all right fine i will use major image and i will cast the image of a manticore climbing out of the magma river on this side of the bank roaring at the fire giant and then leap flying over to the other side visuals and sounds yeah he comes out here roars and then jumps over i think it's a 16 shit where the hell is that on this thing anyone know where that is oh 16 i'm not if we run out of here are we-- how far is his melee ten feet massive we break out yasha and i run 19 yasha hates cows nine uh-huh i need yasha (poofing) fjord's going to run out and hug to the right and he's going to head in this direction towards the magma river and go yasha come on 30 feet okay that's it awesome yeah and i will hold thunder step until yasha is next to me it does yeah just popping yeah like a rock or like a rock just wanted to check oh no (explosion) fjord just explodes the second splat on the fucking ground oh fuck that definitely hits okay constitution check or saving throw 20 that was going to be a plan ruiner for the second time bison buffalo (mooing) (counting) (ramming) bitch slap a cow that hits they got big-ass teeth another constitution saving throw okay all right come on come on natural 20 next time you specify dairy cow yasha will use 40 feet of movement to run past the cow to come into contact with fjord does the cow get an attack of opportunity i understand fjord summons the falchion and stabs it into the ground casting thunder step and will go 90 feet in the direction of the tunnel it does it does 3d10 thunder damage i forgot about that (counting) 20 points of thunder damage constitution 16 sam and actually it takes 22 damage hey all right super invisible right take your time yeah do it you maintain just wait just wait don't do anything yet this is vengeance for the traffic cone guys yeah i don't want to draw any more attention to the cave because that's where he's got to go i'm going to do nothing that's my turn you going to join me on the nope train but my fake manticore is still flying around whatever that citadel is we should go attack the citadel what's your jumping distance negative nope train because of the level up oh my god what is that citadel (singing) if i could turn back time travis and 9d10 (chanting) ones ones he's counting you're unconscious 18d10 what is the matter with you perkins didn't you know this moment was coming when you made those rules i get that lava is dangerous but fuck that was amazing what are you talking about we're fine kill that fire giant with your duplicity kick him in the shin no caleb can walk his happy ass inside no fjord is doing nothing fjord's doing nothing i thought you put it out oh yeah i will run over and pat the fire out yeah you good yasha will put her hand on fjord and hit healing hands giving him seven hit points and yell to caleb caleb five feet is not enough we must keep running must go faster holy shit fuck you and your magma damage 18d8 oh my god
