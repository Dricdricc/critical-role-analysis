spirelings named modeth the clasp had sir gregory's home under surveillance as bad political stuff can be difficult for the way the clasp does business and when our heroes were spotted leaving they had to be interrogated vax reveals his membership to the clasp sect in westruun and modeth calls for a test of their skills and intent pike and vax are then forced to do battle with a chained chimera in the clasp's arena their might rings true and the beast falls beneath their weapons but modeth is not convinced while the two are held overnight they manage to escape from the clasp's lair exiting into the night and managing to locate the rest of the party in the graveyard district knowing their next step is to speak with general krieg vax forges a letter of summons using sir gregory's handwriting and the party is allowed entry into the carefully guarded cloudtop district the innermost area of the city and home to the citrine garrison as well as emon's palace approaching the garrison they have an audience with general krieg who seems nice and keenly interested upon learning of the clasp's involvement he also mentions the difficulty in talking with uriel since the attack
