maybe we drive towards the coast and then you know take the pch down to nicodranas what do you think yeah carmel-by-the-sea's a peach jester caduceus looks awful confused maybe you could fill him in again about why your-- no i do i'm looking out for our tall cow friend no i know what's happening i'm just trying to you know schedule a tea break would you remember his name did he just visit all the time or is he well known in nicodranas for business or shady dealings oh you just found out afterwards yep indeed the road down is treacherous the benefit of being on the coast is that you limit your field of danger right it's only going to come from one direction that's just something to keep in mind yeah no not true actually i have never seen-- nope that could be a pituitary thing i have never seen a sea creature in my life did you really do i believe her ooh that's not terrible oh it is terrible 14 oh shit okay oh i mean as close as you want to be if you want to put your feet in it's an amazing experience it's colder than you might think from where we are now would i have any idea how far from the gates that we just-- have we passed through the gates well we're so close we might as well stop in-- yeah well or your mom's place whatever you want to do first yeah i forget you haven't seen it so if you look in one direction and you look immediately to your left and then immediately to your right all that shit is ocean all of it and as far as-- you see that line the horizon that's all ocean too it is blue skin gone super tan skin those are seagulls they are some dickheads if you leave food out they'll snake that shit in a second oh yeah and they drop shit on you from above so keep your eye out these ones in particular are pricks oh the lessons right pretty nice soak it up man see nott easy as pie i think his ears are underwater i'm not stopping her say goodbye to that king charles spaniel so happy can't wait for this to go wrong well yeah sure nott are you sure you don't want to come in i'm sure jester would hold your hand or something okay i'll walk up to the shore and put my boots in ankles deep in the water and stand there then i'll summon the falchion next to my side hmm how far out is caleb in the water can i use misty step to appear right next to him in the water and scare the shit out of him whoa hey all right there chief okay all right you're good sorry sorry i just figured you want some company it's really tranquil isn't it yeah you seem very at home in the water i'm surprised caleb i mean i must commend you a lot of people are very trepidatious in the face of a force of nature like this it suits you very well oh i didn't leave it intentionally i tried to make my way back up north to see if i could learn more about the sword and everything but i've always loved the water yeah it does yeah i would live right on the water if i could yeah yeah i take care of what i need to take care of i think a calm life on the water would suit me just fine those sandbars are unpredictable man they drop right the fuck off that's an old wives' tale it's not true what is it with nott and the water do you have any idea it might be yeah i think that might have been the tentacle that jester saw from-- you're actually in for-- this is a treat the sunsets are gorgeous here no we're going with you yeah agreed well we should definitely go see jester's mom listen the ocean will be here and we've got plenty of time to come back and fish all sorts of stuff i know i can feel the disappointment-- yeah i know but hey the anticipation keeps building right and then payoff we'll get you some floaties yep they'll sink you like a stone fair enough it is getting dark let's dry off get our clothes back on and get moving but you get amazing storms right thunder lightning it gets foggy here sometimes oh well that's just the jellyfish sting taking effect this is all very familiar to me yeah well just on our way up into-- yeah i'm from port damali but i had seen her a couple times in the city right as we're walking through to make it to jester's mom's place any familiar faces catching eyes nine we can tell from their posture that they're not on leave they're actually there more on duty it's more of a cush posting no they're pretty legit because honestly this is where the bigwigs go so they want the best right they're not going to take a bunch of jack-offs with them yeah the clovis concord is iron clad it's some hefty penalties everything from stealing to murder puts you away for quite a while and it's a hefty fine that whole spectrum in between you can fill in everything that happened in your mind when i said those two it applies to that shit as well kidnapping yeah in between those two they don't like them don't fuck with the postal service i shouldn't have surprised you man i'm sorry about that shit sorry you've got to-- nah i'm not going to say it do we have to pay to get in what was your name again fiona fancypants okay just fiona do they check weapons at the door anything like that you're still very tall a simple what that sucks there's more where that came from if you take good care of them the dog's going to piss everywhere oh yeah you just got peed on beautiful oh yes i got to give it up you said with those nine people that are in the room how many tables are there about ten tables fiona do you recognize anyone in this room you do but i meant the patrons anybody that-- yeah is it better near the front or in the back we'll get as close to the stairs as possible after he peed on you you're going to see a show what could happen that's great was she happy to see you while we've been sitting down there i have not disguised the way i look any glances looks anybody we recognize anybody lingering on us oh yeah we're here we are here feet up on the other chair what move on friend the whole fucking society is based off of tipping yeah [break] fourpony (singing) d&d (singing) d&d beyond that was really something you can't even watch aspca commercials it was mesmerizing jester i mean she really had an effect on the room was it just me or did the lights seem to dance when she was singing you have that making them want an encore huh stunning do you ever wish you could do what she does your singing voice is nice oh that's right man that was our first-- did you want to spend more time with your mother did you-- he didn't look very happy does she have to deal with a lot of jealous suitors she's got lots of security obviously this place seems you know pretty well-- i think we'd all like to meet her would tomorrow be the time for that marquis demesne mar-quez it's a pleasure i can see where jester gets her good looks from i'll give it a kiss i do i try to she's good she's very good always with the teeth she's been very helpful in a few frays we owe her quite a bit nott remember what we talked about criminal penalties-- yeah that's one a1 bingo indeed would you mind if i asked your mom a few just because you're so well-established in this region so well-known and connected as you mentioned does the name marius lepual ring any bells well if it wouldn't be too much of an inconvenience ionos is another name mentioned in the letter no it's many thanks to you i think it's an i please we don't want to get you in any sort of trouble-- oh sure discretion is appreciated the who sam and i don't mean to pry into your business too much but are your appointments exclusively here or have you ventured to his place understood do you know where we might be able to find him does he say where he stays (sirens) understood i'm sure with a personality as large as his it won't be too hard to find some information on him some gentle poking around that you do jester i have to say i don't feel any great rush to continue on out of the city until you at least feel that your mother is safe and protected jester looks extremely motivated perhaps we taking care of this simple errand for you might help compensate for a few nights stay leaky tap oh my god we're freaking out keep it together what was he named draw off those are some huge sweat drops jester that is quite the revelation your dad-- i mean babenon-- is tracking us oh god probably doesn't bother your mom please tell me it plays with those exact pauses you're 60 thank you yeah let's call it a night thank you how do you feel did you want to have a drink and think about it or go for a walk what about a night swim we've done very right by him but we've also tipped him off to the fact that you assume that he might know your mother at a more intimate level would be nice to see his face when you ask the question you know what i mean well-- should we turn in for the night then he came from the sea yeah four poster gaudy-ass-- how'd you sleep jester you know i was thinking one thing that might help take your mind off this is making sure your mom stays safe right take some solid steps to making sure that-- galdar yeah there is actually a lot to do this morning i feel like we should send some to check out the lighthouse maybe talk to the wharfmaster and maybe send someone to-- yeah just some lax scouting you know anything i think yeah i would like to find the wharfmaster we've managed to enter relatively quietly i think if we can maintain a certain level of anonymity we can acquire some decent knowledge meet back here in a little while and share i suppose we could lighthouse and the wharfmaster ooh i like it midday i would like to talk to the wharfmaster plus it would be a good chance to ask around about algar he's influential in the city who's going to the lighthouse okay you three nott do you want to come to the wharfmaster so you can take a swim yeah guns out four to the lighthouse two to the wharfmaster i like it before we get there i pull beau aside all right so this is my turf there may be some familiar faces we came in before and i didn't change the way i looked i wanted to see if maybe that caused a rustle i'm going to change the way i look now yeah i don't know i want to ask about my old crew and my captain son of a bitch betrayed us and all that i don't want people to know that i'm alive when i was back in port damali and i went looking through stuff my mere presence there when none of the rest crew was was enough to get looks it's what drove me out so i think i'll be able to discover more if-- -- me yeah sure yeah yep i'll use mask of many faces to make myself look like a very tanned human with jet black hair pulled back into a tight ponytail in the back with a black goatee maybe slightly overweight (laughter) my name is sheagal (sean connery voice) steven seagal oh god yes i know what that modifier is no thank you that was the same roll both times that was really shit eight yeah i don't know i'll make my way up to him if he's not busy (raspy older voice) yes i'm so sorry i was wondering if i might be able to speak with the wharfmaster and i'll produce two gold coins and start to rub them together i'm sorry we're quite new in town unfortunately my companion and i we are from port damali where we are trying to put down our business roots here i'm sorry does vandren and his crew do they make shipments here regularly it's one of my return clients 26 off of a natural 19 oh why did i roll advantage on that 20 why did i do that sorry you don't say that's quite unfortunate i've been given a task here in town algar does he do a lot of business here on the wharf i happen to have crossed paths with him one night while drinking i guess we made quite the impression on him and we are to deliver some items to his place of residence however my friend here was shit-faced and we forgot to ask where he lives i was hoping perhaps if you could give us a point in the right direction oh yes then that would be most helpful the sluice weave not loose leaf sluice weave oh fantastic that helps us immensely do you know of anyone else looking for a merchant perhaps on the cheaper side services yes rare things and very boring things at times dezima wonderful this has been most helpful well i thank you for your time are there any available docks for rent or for lease if we happen to come upon some vessels or ships one other thing we heard a gentleman over at the bar speaking and someone called out to him marius lepual does that ring-- how do you say that name how were we saying the last name 15 yes very gregarious personality from what we could see what does he do exactly that is where we should look ah yes we did notice actually last night there seemed to be an influx of strange characters coming in last night did you happen to see anything around this area anything in particular that caught your eye i'm sorry i'm so new here i was just hoping to acclimate myself and perhaps-- ah yes perhaps it's time we take our leave thank you maybe we do like the three backward steps and then the turn and then both walk out yeah you were great yeah that came out of nowhere you got a lot better at that okay so i don't know where do we start well i guess we meet back up with the others i know smash all right let's get him we're going to head to-- what time is it ish oh shit fuck yeah we should go meet with the others he's a damn serial killer i knew it calm motherfucker the triple blink afterwards we shoot horses outside just on tuesdays oh my god i love her oh fucking callback amazing fuck your character names so good shit you're not ganking that telescope i've mastered standing so still i was going to say as we're walking can we snag a passerby and ask what that structure is (raspy voice) yes we're new in town and couldn't help but notice that structure there very unique what is it there's a mage that owns this district they don't get on do they around the tide peak do we see the zolezzo the guards around it or is it not as guarded as other structures are are we far away hundreds of feet less i'm sure a detour wouldn't hurt us a closeup scenic let's do it we'll make a detour to go closer to that on the way to the open quay no bodies of water pools lakes decorative how close did beau get to investigate like that i thought he said before you started to melt weird that they're avoiding the thing and green why so different can we touch the outside of it do you see an entrance is it a super long-- like a tower how about we nonchalantly walk by the entrance to get an idea i didn't see a door windows 25-feet-up balcony and other balconies above that oh shit it's real tall well how do you get into a tower with no doors yep you can't parkour up that wall 25 feet can you yes i absolutely would love it 25 feet is pretty far i'm helping her i'm giving her the old (grunting) ugh i did not catch her i'm sorry i'm not real strong i thought you'd make it up you're getting damage because of that we'll let the others know okay and we'll go to the open quay we were trying to get into the tower there's no doors well i've seen it several times coming through before it's called the tide peak but there are no doors did they have doors yeah everybody seems to be avoiding it it sticks out in the general area and there's no doors i just found it odd maybe it's a puzzle oh maybe they said there's a mage here that presides over this district jester do you know anything about this tower we heard the same pretty sure it's the sluice weave why oh you need an invite we were here on time you know long and rather skinny so we did find out that marius lepual-- fuck that last name he's sometimes seen at some of the taverns around some of the shadier ones the skew or the open quay yeah we're in the district it's like a wharf the meandering treasurer is a shop yeah yeah wayfarer's cove is-- is supposed to be delivered to marius-- we got to take what's given to us and right now we don't have an invite to get down to the sluice so we might as well go by the wayfarer's cove we're going we're on the way we're going unless you want to fuck with this tower a little bitthe tower is super interesting to me it's 400 feet tall no doors can you climb 25 feet ooh salt yes we are continuing on but i just want to point out that the place with no doors also fucking shrunk yeah it tickles your pickle doesn't it within something's up mm-hmm make it do the thing yeah like a sea-- like a normal crew mate if you are near nyc make your way over
