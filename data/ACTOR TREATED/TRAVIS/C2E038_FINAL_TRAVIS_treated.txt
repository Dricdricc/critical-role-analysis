all of australia is turning off no that's not a familiar vegepygmy is a familiar you got it pick one grung manshoon lou albano gran metalik benadryl (singing) welcome to the jungle i'll be up front yep she's nice in the middle for a good spread first roll with the new cr die do you do that out loud the local greenery i don't need it but okay 25 caduceus can i ask you what do you hear when you converse (whispering) yeah i'm sorry no nothing oh yeah and caduceus please what the fuck plus why are you rolling perception checks yeah caduceus nott want to check it out yeah such a good idea just think slot machine ding ding ding ding (hissing) save friends this is good this is some uncharted shit right now what golden snake is it just a cobra head by itself or is there also a body yeah we can take ten minutes we'll set out a little perimeter just to make sure we deflect any unwanted-- huh why would we do that you certainly could i don't see what harm it could bring sure go for it he's rolling dice you guys is the shack large enough to house our entire we'll kind of-- i have a question for you matt is it really just us and avantika and jamedi and that's it yeah that's the humidity i walk over to avantika and say might i ask you said your men are dedicated to this cause as well how much do you share with them very effective blind belief is quite remarkable i'm assuming you've shown them things to garner some level of expectation of your abilities i don't doubt it for a moment i would expect nothing less let's hope it doesn't come to that she just gets a finger full of sweat are we satisfied all right i'll take it is that advantage better 21 and sweet of the what what the fuck you slick motherfucker really out of the fucking blue just make one 20 somebody cast something right does that mean somebody cast something i'm sorry did you say not quite-- do you detect anything sinister yeah that's inherent sure right thank you for letting me know i hope you'll keep an eye on it for us all right no i asked if she shared with her men her passions and all the details that she knows and all the knowledge i thought maybe she might covet that but it seems like she's quite forthcoming she's trying to build a following like a zealot almost you know build believers out of her crew yeah she's convincing if she's a liar i think she genuinely wants to summon forth this thing that she's the chosen yeah no i'm fine fine rested rem sleep is some of the best so you know i feel energized jazzed excited to continue on ghost stories yeah yep wow do you want to tell me what's in people's heads admittedly well i admit that i'm not sure about a lot of this no pressure right i will try to fill in as many details as i can totes marisha and you can see the temperature rising shh two people go up that's a bad gesture we're staying put his big arms are five feet like these big-ass-- you ever seen an anaconda mouth there are lots of teeth in there it's real bad three of the other party the other two only had eyes that seemed off we're going to let them go the canopy of trees above right there's no sort of-- it's a new day yeah you make a good point i'll join you anybody else everybody else should stay at least 20 25 feet back yasha should stay with the healers for sure the whole time you me jamedi and avantika in the front is that all right well jester doesn't it glow just be dark and not attract any other attention i think maybe we invite them in and one of us keeps out-- on who i just peed a little come on snitch oh my god we got ambushed how far away are you guys oh shit that means there's probably more than two yeah why would you make that and he is getting fucked up right now both our healers are outside typical nobody seven plus-- i got to get her sheet i think it's nine beau caduceus yasha has nine i have eight what jealous jealous of what i like it get some of that shit back atta boy it's like avatar in the fucking-- shit how many hit points do you-- we are in a total danger zone and we're taking strolls what on both wow yeah yasha will use her full movement to follow avantika out of the bubble the bubl√© is that within melee great she'll take a swipe that is a 17 so that's 2d6 right no she didn't because i-- yep great six points of damage no nine points of damage yeah that's 16 oh plus four so six so ten ten points of damage and with her bonus action she would like to rage can i use my 30 feet of movement to run that direction around the far side of the ruin yep oh shit i'll just fire both streams of eldritch blast from each hand 13 second one that'll hit 23 excellent nice that's 11 points of eldritch blast nice great that's it good rolls oh the one that i've been shooting at or the closest-- me too right 21 she'll make it reckless that's right yeah that's a 24 she's raging so 3d6 nice 14 oh get it jamedi knees weak she'll run up and take her two swipes reckless yes there you go yeah you know it that's a natural 20 dope that's seven 14 she'll see it sit there and she'll reach up high and she'll try and cleave off the front of the jaguar's head in one downward swing she still has one more attack can she use the rest of her movement to move towards the jaguar i think she has ten feet of her movement is that melee or just outside of it oh great reckless as well 21 yeah 14 points of damage plus three right or no oh thank you lets back it down to nine i'll take just enough of a step back to use eldritch blast again and i'll fire both of them at it eldritch blast 14 oh shit the first one was better 14 as well on the second one okay great (counting) 19 points what did you do i'll light it up with this crackling green eldritch blast energy coming from both of my palms causing its fur to smoke and burn off and its snake heads to repel i'll look over at nott all of us six are you okay i don't know that we did there were only two of them and because caleb left the bubble it disappeared right we made a bit of a ruckus that's the last thing you want to do in a jungle agreed we should rally up back-to-back while caleb casts it i think that's a fair assumption i still think one of us should stay up in shifts inside this bubble just in case what are you doing to that poor dog eh whatever that's a high number one ounce is good cool jesus let's get everything together first jamedi following you river dancers yeah [break] ooh yeah right okay pass without a trace and do i still have-- no i don't not anymore do i have the thing i don't happen to have the blessing on me laura do i have a blessing anymore 14 well i was going to-- you don't want to give it to caduceus give it to him okay there might be some leeches in this jungle maybe some ticks yeah what is it give her mushrooms smell this bip did you get hit in the fight and nanny fell too that's true didn't know the incredible hulk was in this motherfucker did you at the base of the structure it's doing that okay so if-- i'll go over to jamedi if we can clear him is the path you've taken before clear as far as you can see i don't know which way you went can anyone create a distraction that doesn't put their own person at risk it's not us clearing and then the building there's stuff although we could throw you in a net and act like you were dinner who's got a net how many of us can change one two three four awesome great two of us one each take tie them up in rope-- kind of yeah that's less of what we're looking for yeah sure yeah i think we should try and be as sneaky as possible if for some reason shit hits the fan i can make a pretty i think spectacular distraction that doesn't put me or us at risk but i think we should try stealth first stealth distraction fuck shit up cool yeah what act like you're tied up yeah we'll do it anyway we'll tie your hands in the front i agree that's not a bad thought are there several dozen people or is it-- let's do that yeah i'll use mask of many faces to look like one of those fucks and let's try to paint some scales on the non-changeling folks of holding where are you going where are we meeting at the temple at the top is that a one shit god-- why did you roll out that big fucker agreed nice job he's going to fucking leave again good job indeed i'll take out several feet of rope from the bag of holding and say we should do this before he achieves the destination forward no well kind of not really no i mean i can pop in and out but-- yeah that one none we'll put two in the front two in the back and put these three in the-- good call she'll be fine i'll pilot her 21 pass without a trace what natural one 25 natural 15 describe the two again i vote for the one guy flaying the lizardmen mm-hmm and it's one guy that never is no guys let's go that way we'll go towards the flaying trying to blend in if there is a building to walk beside i would prefer to have our shittily drawn and one very nice one closest to the building with us on the outside mama elephants and then baby elephants oh god oh god oh god aww yeah why are there any windows doors anything on these buildings can we move up to the side of one and glance in as we slow down just a little bit to peek through no before we get to the intersection do we look in the window ugh seven keep going all right we'll push through as that one turns i'll turn to yasha and i'll go (hisses) and punch her in the face and say go down stand over yasha take the rope and start tying her hands together oh no we're in the middle of the street we can't tie them up we've got to go yeah we're picking up and moving expeditiously away yeah or distraction not now we've got to go do we seen anyone else around besides those two oh 20 they're large beings right sam laura and yep we're working the rope fuck it i summon the sword i run over and i shove it into his chest i plunged the sword into his chest okay with advantage amazing that is a 16 are they automatic crits oh the damage is a crit the second one is a 23 yeah 23 is the highest one both hit both crit okay 29 out you know what'd be great right now a distraction maybe fire it is all stone there's no wood there's no nothing let's just get out ceiling stone too out okay i will point down the street away from us and go (hissing) and cast major image and i will summon the image of a manticore a large manticore roaring and thrashing in the streets the whole shebang-- make sound it smells the whole thing (shouting) go yes so he has to turn and move away from us i can't i point at the manticore no you did it can i take the sword and take a shot right at his wrist that's holding her with the hand that's holding onto jester okay 17 okay it's going great we're doing good oh that's good that's a 14 yep 13 i have yasha's character sheet and she rolled a ten how far is this person can i use my bonus action to misty step up behind them and i will kick them down the stairs towards the rest of us oh god those used to be really great for me 17 oh that's not me jesus i was looking at yasha's and it was like when did i get necrotic shroud let's get the fuck out of here yeah in out of light out of the way 12 for me natural 18 for yasha the top is open air yeah we head towards the tablet of the crimson variety doesn't matter boy sure was fun sam we did yes we close it yeah we may not have much time darkvision what do we see time to go you first check for traps oh shit the big black cobra hood arms or just the serpentine body taller than the other three that were in the chamber don't we have that little box that appears that's just counting down from ten nine eight and it's going to automatically skip to the fight right now right we can just hit it yeah but cobra fight good shit matt
